        "transcript":"What was the ... point? He's literally an idiot. No one's gonna trust Q\n from now on. Karma is a bitch. JEFF PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... -...that now we could\npull off a blindside.\n-Mm-hmm. KENZIE:\n Everyone is so distracted,\n I could drive something\nthat's a little risky. The idol has zero value\nto me now. -I'm ready\nto burn it on the spot.\n-Right. CHARLIE:\n Tiff's gonna play her idol,\n so now we've got to figure out\n what the heck we're gonna do. -Yeah.\n-Yeah. HUNTER:\n I'm beginning\n to feel pretty nervous. HUNTER:\n So I am 100% playing my idol. If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol, and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Tenth person voted out and the third member\nof our jury-- Hunter. Hunter, the tribe has spoken. Yes, they have. HUNTER:\n There it is in all of its splendor. LIZ:\n After Tribal Council, I was so ticked off. No one told me\n there was a split vote between Q and Hunter. And so I am trying to... hold my composure\nso I don't explode, but I'm thinking, \"What the heck, you ho-bags?\" How y'all feeling?\nY'all okay? I just want to know\nwhat is it about me that made y'all say,\n\"No, we don't want to let Liz in on the split vote\"? VENUS:\nHonestly, Liz,\neverything happened ten minutes before Tribal,\nand there was... -By the time...\n-Is that true? -That is straight-up\nwhat happened.\n-That's straight-up. Well, damn. TIFFANY:\nWe thought he had an idol, and we was like,\n\"All right, well, just in case,\nlet's just split the votes.\" They're like,\n\"How are we gonna do that?\" -We're like, \"Well,\nLiz is already voting...\"\n-LIZ: Okay. 'Cause I felt stupid as .... We said, \"Liz is\nalready voting with you.\" Like, stupid as ... just now. Considering\n I was the only person left out of this vote, I feel pretty dumb. On top of that,\n I wanted to get Q out. He did almost blow up my game, and he's not someone\nthat I can trust moving forward. Hunter's also got to be crazy to\nnot see that blindside coming. If he had an idol,\nhe should have played it. No, he overplayed his hand\nand he thought, \"I can save this\nfor the next time because clearly\neveryone hates Q right now.\" TIFFANY:\n Tonight, Tribal erupted\nas Jeff predicted it would. Once again, Q was causing chaos, and because of that, it kind of threw Hunter\n off the scent. If he did have an idol, I guess\nthe smokescreen was so good that he didn't play it\nbecause now our biggest physical threat\nis on his way to the jury house. He's grown. If he wants to... If he wants to reconcile things,\nhe could come talk. At this point, my immediate\n next step is to get Q out. I'm tired of the drama,\n I'm tired of the chaos. That man did too much. He flew too close to the sun,\nand his wings burnt off. And now\nhe's feeling the pressure. KENZIE:\nIs Maria on the beach with Q? Yeah. Maria went\nto go talk to Q, I think. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. -Okay?\n-Come on. Come here. MARIA:\n Right now Q is, like,\n sitting back in the shadows. Q is sort of checked out\nof the game mentally. But I think that Q still\n has some fight in him. So, for me, this is\na great opportunity to connect, but he's a wild card\nat this point. I know, basically, I got\nto win the rest of the way, and, you know, I'm cool\nwith going through like that. And when I lose,\nif I go home, I go home. At this point,\n I think everyone wants me out, so there's no need\nfor me to go around and sit around the fire\nand talk to these people. They really don't want\nto talk to me. So I'm okay with that. Right now\n my strategy moving forward is, first win the immunity. If I can win, and now that\nit's in the individual stage, I control my own destiny. I'm not out of this game,\n trust me. It might look like it,\nbut it's not. Yeah. Q is not only a good person, but, like, he's also a number\n that I can use to vote with me, and so I... I definitely want\nto keep him around. (Maria mutters) MARIA:\n Q's an easy vote. Everybody wants him out,\n but in my mind there are bigger targets here,\n and so it may be time\nto focus on somebody else. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a (birds squawking) KENZIE:\nGood morning. -Good morning.\n-Good morning, Kenzie. Oh. How do you feel\nabout yesterday's vote? KENZIE:\nI mean, I'm glad\nit went the way it did. Like... I think we can. I know that\nthis is a hard thought for you, but I think Q would be willing\nto work with us, um, in that,\nhe told me last night, \"I'm a vote. Use me.\" MARIA: Yesterday\nthe plan was to blindside Tiff, but then\n we switched it to Hunter. But the biggest thing\nfor me is that Tiff has an idol. That's not a secret. And... Tiffany's sort of been\non my radar for a while. Evidently, she's still\n on Kenzie's radar, too, which is just music to my ears. -I want her gone regardless.\n-Okay. KENZIE:\n Tiff has been my number one\n since day one. We have voted the exact same way\n this entire game. Tiff and I have made\nevery move together. We have played\n almost the exact same game, so I've got to differentiate. I've got to build my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and a huge checkpoint on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nis voting out your number one. That means I just need to be\n a little more sneaky than her to get her out first\nbefore she comes for me. 'Cause I know it's coming.\nI know it's coming.

PROBST:\nI got to say, Charlie, today you all look\nnoticeably smaller. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: I can see\nthe clothes are big. Your bodies are shrinking. Are you starting\nto feel that cumulative effect? Listen, every time I stand up, I literally feel like\nI'm about to faint, you know. I have to go back down\non my hands and knees. I've never felt that\never before in my whole life. All right, shall we get\nto today's reward challenge? (all assent) PROBST: For today's challenge,\n you're gonna race through a series of obstacles\n until you reach a sack of sandbags. You're gonna throw\nthose sandbags into a net tunnel and then use your hands\n to get 'em out the other side. Once they're all through,\n you'll grab one last sandbag, go under a net, crawl,\n and attempt to land that sandbag\n on a very tall target. First person\nto finish wins reward. Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? -Yes.\n-You know we do.\n-PROBST: It's day 18. You've gone a long time\nwithout food. You passed up\nthe opportunity at rice. So I know you're gonna be glad\nto hear that you're playing for the biggest reward\nof the season. -(gasping)\n-Applebee's. -Yes!\n-(cheering) -Wow.\n-Oh, my God. -(whooping)\n-VENUS: Oh, my God. You want burgers? -Wings.\n-Yeah.\n-Yes. -I want chicken wings.\n-PROBST: Wings. -And French fries.\n-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. -PROBST: French fries?\n-MARIA: Yes. I think we got you covered. (cheering) -For real?\n-Yes. Every Wednesday,\nmy daughter and I have -Survivor sleepover.\n-Wow. We go directly to Applebee's,\nI get the burger, she gets the pizza,\nand then we go home. Then we watch Survivor. Yay! Oh, if only\nyou can win this challenge. \u266a Burger! \u266a All right,\nlet me walk you through what's in store for the winner. All the apps you love. Boneless wings. -Oh, my God.\n-Oh. -Spinach and artichoke dip.\n-Oh, God. -Aah!\n-Chicken quesadillas. Oh! We're just getting started,\nCharlie. -(Charlie groans)\n-Perhaps you're interested in the Bourbon Street\nChicken & Shrimp. -Yeah.\n-Or maybe you're in the mood, like Liz, for a burger. How about\nthe Bourbon Street Mushroom -Swiss Burger?\n-That's my favorite. -Oh, my God.\n-That's 100% ground beef. It's my favorite one. Damn. Smothered in sauteed onions -and mushrooms.\n-Jeff, you're killing us. -MARIA: Oh, my God.\n-PROBST: Somebody say dessert? -Yes. Yes. Chocolate. Chocolate.\n-LIZ: The chocolate one -I was telling you guys about.\n-PROBST: We got some dessert. How about the Oreo cookie shake? -Ah!\n-Yeah. I might eat it\neven though I'm allergic. And to close it out, an Applebee's reward\nwould not be complete without the Shark Bowl. (overlapping chatter) PROBST:\nApplebee's rum -cocktail favorite.\n-Ah. Ooh, careful now. All this can be yours\nif... you win this challenge. -Ah!\n-All right,\nwe'll draw for spots. -Get it on. Let's do it.\n-Do it. All right, here we go. Applebee's. Biggest reward\nof the season, Survivor 46. Survivors ready? -(sighs)\n-Go! You're going over, over and through\nwith this first obstacle. Everybody moving quickly. Q is out first, then Tiff. Here comes Ben.\nStart untying your sandbags. Charlie's through. Liz is through. -And Kenzie's... through.\n-(groans) Once all your bags are out,\nstart launching 'em in that net tunnel. Keep tossing. Q has all his through. Q in the lead. Ben is now through. Tiff is through,\nworking on hers. It is Q, Tiff,\nVenus, Charlie and Ben. Maria, Liz and Kenzie\nstill working to get all their bags in. Q is through. He's working\non that last sandbag. That's the money right there.\nThat's the one you're going\nto land on the target. Day 18, Applebee's on the line. (Liz groans) PROBST:\nIt's Q in the lead. There's Tiff. Q working\nthrough that net crawl. Oh. PROBST:\nHere goes Maria. She's in it. Here comes Tiffany. Everybody else is working\non their sandbags now. Tiff is moving quickly\nthrough that net crawl. That's how you do it. Q is out. Get that sandbag\nand start tossing. All you got\nto do is stick that sandbag at the top of that target. Charlie's in the net crawl. There's Ben. Venus is there. -(Kenzie groans)\n-Kenzie struggling\nto get through. Oh, my God.\nIt's so hard. Liz in dead last. 18 days of fatigue\nshowing up right now. The answer to your problem\nis Applebee's. -You just got to earn it.\n-Ah! Q with the first toss.\nHe's got a time lead. Tiff is out.\nStart untying, Tiff. Q with another toss. Q just misses. Here goes Tiff. Tiff on and off\nwith her first toss. Here's Maria. Got to get that sandbag out. Here comes Ben. Charlie's through. Venus is through.\nBunch of people through at once. Everybody on the sandbags\nexcept for Kenzie and Liz, taking a very long time\nthrough the net crawl. -Oh, my God.\n-Keep fighting! -You're still in this.\n-(groaning) Q is on and off. Here goes Maria. Maria's short. Ben way short. Charlie's short.\nEverybody's short. Somebody's gonna win this, and\nthe whole day is gonna change. Want that burger! PROBST:\nHere comes Liz. -Kenzie's through.\n-Oh, my God. PROBST:\nLet's go! One toss is all it takes. This is what you dream about when you dream about Survivor. This moment right here. Venus with the right height,\njust a little short. Tiff is on and off again. Tiff and Q have been very close\nseveral times. Who's gonna pull it out? (grunts) Kenzie way short. Here goes Liz\nwith her first toss. -Ah!\n-Liz almost sticks one. -Oh, that was close.\n-KENZIE: That was close, Liz. PROBST:\nSandbags everywhere. Day 18, Applebee's on the line. All it takes is one toss. Tiff a little long. Here goes Q. Q does it! Q wins reward! -VENUS: Way to go, Q.\n-PROBST: Applebee's. -Biggest reward of the season.\n-BEN: Good job, Q. VENUS:\nYou killed it, my guy. PROBST:\nNothing easy out here. Everybody exhausted. All right, Q, come on over. Got some talking to do. -Whoo!\n-All right, so, congratulations.\n-Thank you. You have earned a great reward, biggest of the season--\nApplebee's. Gonna sweeten the deal a little.\nThis reward is gonna take place at the sanctuary, -where good things happen.\n-Ah. PROBST:\nAnd it's an overnight stay. -MARIA: Oh, my God. Wow.\n-Wow. You have a lot of power\nin the game and a lot\nof strategic decisions to make. Choose one person to join you. Q:\nSo, Jeff, in my everyday life, I always\ntry to make things right. So, for my first choice,\nI'm gonna choose Tiff. PROBST:\nTiff, come on over. VENUS:\nYay. PROBST: What an interesting\nchoice, given the last Tribal\nwhere you two were done. Jeff,\nI'm-I'm actually surprised, but I am excited because\nI do feel like we need to talk in, like, a setting\nwhere it's not high pressure, not a whole bunch\nof people around and just really be able\nto hash things out. PROBST:\nAll right, Q, choose another person\nto join you. -I'm gonna beg.\n-PROBST: Before you decide... I'm gonna beg. Please. PROBST:\nWell, Liz is already begging. LIZ:\nPlease. Q:\nThe next choice\nthat I'm gonna make, Jeff, it's just based off, when I was out there by myself, there was one person that came\nand checked on me, genuinely, wanted to know\nif I was all right. So I just want to say thank you. And the next choice\nI'm gonna make is Maria. -Thank you.\n-PROBST: Maria, come on over. -Thank you.\n-Yeah. (crying) PROBST:\nAll right, Q,\nyou have one more person. So it's gonna be four people\nat the sanctuary for Applebee's, four people back at camp,\nand you have one person, Liz, sobbing, has talked about food\nthis entire season, how she can't eat\ncertain things, therefore she's more hungry. But it's also\na million-dollar game with only a few people left. (Liz sniffles, cries) Q:\nLiz-- she hasn't eaten, um, in almost 18 days. This is something\nthat she could potentially eat. But Kenzie was with me\nsince day one, um, and it's something\nin me is saying, \"Bring the family\nback together.\" So my decision is basically going to be\nto bring Kenzie. -Oh, my God.\n-PROBST: Come on over, Kenzie. (crying) PROBST:\nThe Yanu three\nis back together again after declaring they were dead\nat Tribal Council. Q:\nSorry, y'all. (sniffling, crying) Liz, do you feel comfortable talking\nabout what you're feeling? (birds singing) I'm pissed! Y'all say\nyou ain't gone without eating. I see you eat every day! (sighing deeply) Q, you almost blew up\nmy whole game! You overshadowed\neverything I was trying to do! And I said it's cool. I didn't say nothing! (Liz groans) I don't even want\nto be around y'all! I'm just... Q... ...you blew up\nmy whole freaking spot. I didn't even know\nabout the damn -split vote last night.\n-Q: But, Liz, you voted for me\nlast night, so... I made decisions based off\nwhere my head is right now in the game. I'm sorry. (Liz sighing) LIZ:\nI'm over it now. Thank y'all\nfor letting me have that. I feel better. I just exploded. I'm sorry. Back to your regularly\nscheduled program. Liz, you don't have to apologize\nfor having your emotions. Obviously, missing out on rice is coming into play now. I haven't eaten since the merge. I've had zero calories\nsince the merge. But there's hope\nin the game always. I don't even think I screamed\nthat hard during my divorce. (laughs, groans) All right,\nhere's what's gonna happen. Q, Kenzie, Tiff, Maria, you're gonna leave here,\ngo to the sanctuary. Applebee's chef is there\nwaiting for you. Fresh, beautiful\nApplebee's food. You will spend the night,\nget a good night's sleep, and return to camp\nin the morning. -Head out,\nenjoy a well-deserved afternoon.\n-Thanks, Jeff. MARIA:\nThank you. Thanks, Q. PROBST:\nLiz, Ben, Venus, Charlie, got nothing for you. Grab\nyour stuff. Head back to camp. LIZ:\n I am... so... angry. Q screwed me over.\n Not only am I not going on this reward,\nnot only am I not eating, but now I'm not feeling\n that connection to my daughter and our Survivor ritual, and I'm gonna have to go back and just sit in all this disgusting feelings. Uh, look, Survivor's tough. Think you can do it? Let's see.\nApply to be on Survivor. \u266a I s yo u wi th m e no w? \u266a \u266a Then biggie-biggie-bounce \u266a \u266a I know you dig the way \u266a \u266a I sw-sw-switch my style \u266a \u266a Holla \u266a \u266a People sing around \u266a \u266a Now people gather 'round \u266a \u266a Now people jump around \u266a \u266a Go, get ur freak on \u266a \u266a Go, get ur freak on \u266a \u266a Go, get ur freak on \u266a Ho me Qu ot e Ex pl or er l et s yo u ea si ly c om pa re coverage options so you don't\nend up overpaying. Good, because we've spent\na lot on this kitchen. Oh, yeah, really\nhigh end stuff. Sorry, that's our ghost. He's more annoying\nthan anything. Oh, a decal\nthat says \"kitchen.\" Good, I forgot\nwhere I was for a second. Wi th m od er at e to s ev er e pl aq ue p so ri as is , my skin was no longer mine. My active psoriatic arthritis\njoint symptoms held me back. Don't let symptoms define you. Emerge as you. With Tremfya\u00ae, most people saw\n 90% clearer skin at 4 months and the majority\n stayed clearer, at 5 years. Tremfya\u00ae is proven\n to significantly reduce joint pain,\n stiffness and swelling. It's just 6 doses a year,\n after 2 starter doses. Serious allergic reactions\n may occur. Tremfya\u00ae may increase\n your risk of infections and lower your ability\n to fight them. Tell your doctor if you have\n an infection or symptoms or if you had\n a vaccine or plan to. Emerge as you. Emerge Tremfyant\u00ae. Ask you doctor about Tremfya\u00ae. ( \u266a\u266a ) (birds singing) Okay. Thank you\nfor letting me have my moment. I let it out. I'm over it. Thank you for letting me... -spew what I had to spew.\n-CHARLIE: Hey. Oh, my God.\nI was, like, literally screaming at this person. We've all wanted\nto do that to Q at least once. LIZ:\n I'm so mad at Q. I mean, everyone's aware\nthat I have allergies. On Survivor, I can't really eat much. I'm allergic to coconut,\n most fruits, chicken. A lot of everyday foods\n causes my throat to clench. But I can eat\n any kind of beef, and the burger is the exact burger\nthat I order. It's like our thing.\nLike, the... So, to not pick me\n and deny someone who has barely eaten in 18 days, who has this emotional\n connection with this meal-- I don't know\nwhat kind of person does that. You, of all people,\nshould have been... He's a villain, yo, straight up. There's nothing else to say. He's a villain, bro.\nLike, that's it. You know,\n Liz has a daughter at home, and when the Applebee's reward\n gets revealed, Liz very publicly states that this would make her feel\nat home. Ugh! That Bourbon Burger\nis what I get, too. BEN:\n And on top of that, the Bourbon Burger is\nher go-to menu item. My anger is satisfying\nmy hunger right now. Yeah, my need for vengeance. BEN:\n Like, how can you not feel\n for that? But I think\n Q is working from the bottom, so the only option he has is\n to rekindle his old alliances. But I think they would be idiots\nif they fell for this crap. If I were in their position,\nI'd be like, \"Yo, let me get the Applebee's\nand still get Q out next.\" \u266a \u266a ALL: Bula. Welcome to Applebee's. Bula. Wow. -MARIA (gasps):\nLook at that food.\n-TIFFANY: Wow. -Cheers.\n-Q: Cheers. TIFFANY:\n Applebee's, literally, like, is the spot. -Cheers.\n-KENZIE: Cheers. -Cheers.\n-KENZIE: Okay. TIFFANY:\n We get these big, beautiful Shark Bowl drinks. I take one sip\n and I'm like, \"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We about\nto have a good time in here.\" -\u266a Hey! \u266a\n-I love this. KENZIE:\nHell yeah. Think amazing. -(Tiffany laughs)\n-Giddyap. -This never tasted better.\n-TIFFANY: In my entire life. Me and my friends go\n to Applebee's every week just for the spinach\nand artichoke dip, I promise you. -This the appetizer, y'all.\n-Mm-hmm. I know. Oh, my God. This is\nan appetizer. I forgot. As soon as it entered my body, I felt, like, 18 days\n of starvation just evaporate. I'm ready to play Survivor again. Let's go. KENZIE:\nWell, Liz was pissed. -Oh, my God.\n-Yeah.\n-(Kenzie laughs) -That was tough.\n-Q, you might have\nto watch your back when you get back to the camp. It was tough, but, you know, I've dealt with that,\nlike firing people. So I was just like,\n\"Man, that's sad, but dang.\" -TIFFANY: Yeah?\n-It was really hard to watch. -Yeah.\n-KENZIE: It was tough. Q:\n It was hard for me to see Liz crying like that, but at this point\n I think everyone wants me out. So my only option is to make my bed\nback where I started, and that's with the Yanu three. Man, it would make sense\nfor us and Siga, your two--\nBen, Charlie and you-- and then the three of us, and... -MARIA: Yeah.\n-Yeah.\n-We'll see what happens. I mean, I really have\nno strong ties to Venus or Liz, so I have... I have no qualms -about that whatsoever.\n-Yeah. Yeah. I don't either. Q:\n For me, this moment was about pushing my game forward\nwith the right people. Maria-- she is someone\n that's been in my corner, and those are the reasons\n I made my choices. I don't owe Liz anything. -Thank you, Q.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. Thank you, Q. I can't believe\nthis is happening right now. MARIA:\nI know. KENZIE: While we're eating,\n I'm thinking, Q is like\n my unhealthy boyfriend. He's buying me a nice meal\nat Applebee's, hoping I just get amnesia\nand forget about the fact that he's left me out of plans\nfor half of this game. Like, no, I'm smart, Q. Takes a little more to woo me. You ready for the main course? -Yes.\n-Ooh. Oh, wow. -Oh, my God,\nit's mashed potatoes.\n-KENZIE: I know. -You're gonna have\nto roll me out of here.\n-I know. On top of that, I don't know how he could pick me over Liz. I was like,\n\"Damn, Q, like, that's cold.\" Like, that is cold. So I'm like, \"Oh, after\n all the nonsense you've pulled \"the past couple of days, like,\nI'm just supposed to forgive you because\nwe broke bread together?\" Like, that's ridiculous. -Hope you guys are enjoying\nthat shrimp and chicken.\n-Oh. -Oh, it's amazing.\n-TIFFANY: OMG. -Here is a burger on the house.\n-Thank you so much. -MARIA: Wow.\n-Q: Wow.\n-TIFFANY: Wow. -KENZIE: Wow. Beautiful.\n-TIFFANY: Oh, my God. KENZIE:\nOur stomachs have shrank so much\n that my stomach hurt. And the burger comes out. \u266a \u266a This is the Bourbon Burger that\nLiz gets every single Wednesday. Thank you. KENZIE:\n And I can see why. Like, it's so melty,\n it's so moist, and the mushrooms\nand the onions. Oh! But I'm so full\n of all the other stuff. Like, I just couldn't do it. (laughter) And I am mortified\nbecause I'm one of the people who are, like,\ntaking her burger dream away. Wow. I'm about\nto sleep like a baby. -I could sleep right now.\n-Like, immediately right now. (scraping) \u266a \u266a (birds singing) (sniffles) (sniffles) Okay. LIZ:\n It's, like, really hard today. I'm just in my feelings. (sniffles) And it's not just about food. I grew up really poor. My family had a lot\n of food insecurity. Pretty much,\n we barely ever had enough. And so, being able\n to sit down at Applebee's with my daughter\n is so important to me. (sniffles) (voice breaking):\nMy favorite part of the week... ...is... it sounds so silly, but it's picking her up\nafter yoga. We go immediately to Applebee's. I turn my phone off. And that's the one night\n of the week where it's just us, and it's something we bond over. And to have so much hope that, \"Okay, Liz, you're gonna get\n this, you're gonna get this,\" and then it's...\nit's Applebee's, and it's the thing I order. (crying) I really wanted\n that connection to my kid and that delicious,\njuicy burger. (laughs) \u266a \u266a MARIA:\nWow. This'll definitely\ntide us over. -See y'all.\n-See you later.\n-Enjoy, Q. I ain't buying none\nof this crap. Play me once, shame on you.\nPlay me twice, shame on me. -Yeah.\n-TIFFANY:\nI'm not rerouting my game because you're going\non an apology tour. MARIA:\n Q's brought us on this reward, and we're in this, like,\nwonderful mood. And then, like, the minute Q steps out,\n Tiff and Kenzie said, \"Q's got to go. Q's got to go.\" Right. Yeah. MARIA:\n Q is still a number for me.\nQ is somebody I trust. But it sounds like Q has really rubbed people\n the wrong way long enough, and it might have\nto be his time to go. >> T EC H: N ee d to g et yo ur w in ds hi el d fi xe d? Safelite makes it easy.

LIZ:\nThis is stunning. Yeah. How you feeling today, Liz? I feel all right. A little nervous\nif we have a challenge today. Yeah. LIZ:\nSince they're so well-fed\nand rested. -What's up?\n-Hey.\n-Good morning. LIZ:\nWe were just wondering\nwhen we'd see you. CHARLIE:\nWe don't need\nto hear all the details, but I do want to hear\na little bit about what... LIZ: The winners return\n from their feast, and I'm ticked. I don't want to hear anything\nthey have to say. I had spinach and artichoke dip. VENUS:\nI'm surprised\nyou didn't bite, like, -a little bit of the burger.\n-TIFFANY: Nah, just because I was so damn full,\nI could barely eat any. LIZ:\n I'm listening to them, and it turns out\n no one ate the burger. Ah! I mean, honestly,\n it's just another, like... (clicks tongue)\nslap in the face. Oh, Oreo milkshake, hands down. That Oreo milkshake\nwas delicious. I'm lactose intolerant, -but I couldn't not do it.\n-Okay. LIZ:\n \"Oh, my God. \"I couldn't even eat the bacon. I'm lactose intolerant,\nbut I ate the milkshake anyway.\" I mean, shut up. Like, read the freaking room. I'm just, like,\n all over the place. But as much\n as this not eating is making my mind kind of crazy, I do still have\nmy eyes on the prize. I'm sorry, Q.\nI'm sorry I exploded. You're allowed\nto express your emotions. I was just really hungry. So I decided to say I'm sorry for my outburst\n at the challenge. It's the biggest lie I've\never said in this game so far because, honestly,\n I want to vote Q out. I was lying. I'm not sorry. I'm definitely not. I'm super proud of myself\nfor yelling at him. (chuckles) I will be having\na hot girl summer, though, when I get home. -Luckily, I...\n-The Survivor diet. (chuckles) Be back to, like,\nmy tenth grade body weight. Q:\nLiz apologized for her outburst, but I'm not concerned\n with what Liz thinks. I'm not ashamed\nof going on a reward that I won. I can choose who I want,\n and, of course, there's gonna\n always be someone mad. (groans loudly) Q:\n Hey, it's a business decision. Uh, just like at home,\nif I fire someone, I don't care if they're kicking\nand crying on the floor. They have to go. So, at the end of the day, an apology out here,\nyou can keep it. -Okay. What's the quick update?\n-All right. So Q proposed Venus, then Liz. -CHARLIE: Okay.\n -MARIA: And then the ladies proposed Q out first. CHARLIE:\n So, is the Tiff blindside off? MARIA:\n For now, but... I think that\nit's all gonna come down to if Q wins immunity or not. -Okay.\n-But what were\nyou all proposing? I-I was thinking\nthat it would be... Tiff. Is that what\neveryone here was talking about? -No.\n-Okay. -CHARLIE: Q.\n -MARIA: Okay. CHARLIE: That's all\n we were talking about. MARIA: After Q did not take Liz\n on the reward, everybody wants him out. The only thing that scares me\nis that... Tiff has an idol. -Yeah.\n-Which is why I'm like... -I don't know how long\nthat can be on the back burner.\n-Right. The problem is,\n Tiff has an idol, and it's something that, like, we really have\n to get out of this game, but everybody is just like, \"We want Q gone.\" But Q is causing chaos. And he proved himself capable\n of winning challenges. So if we have an opportunity,\nhe should go. MARIA:\nI think if he doesn't win,\nhe's got to go. -Yeah.\n-VENUS: I-I agree. Yeah. I made my feelings pretty clear. CHARLIE:\n Everybody is saying,\n \"Beat Q at all costs.\" But for me and Maria, Tiffany\n could be more of a threat. So I don't want\n Tiffany to win either. So we need to make sure\nthat Tiffany and Q lose this challenge. Fo r yo ur m os t br il li an t sm il e, Crest has you covered. \u266a\u266a (laughing) Nice smile, Brad. Nice! Thanks?

Once again,\nimmunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're gonna hold on to a handle connected to a bucket\n containing 25% of your pregame body weight. -Oh, damn.\n-(whistles) PROBST:\nAs your hands start to fatigue, that bucket's gonna lower. When it drops... ...you're out. Last person left standing\nwins immunity, -guaranteed\na spot in the final seven.\n-Seven. PROBST:\nLosers, Tribal Council, where\nsomebody will be the 11th person voted out and become\nthe fourth member of our jury. One more thing to deal with. -Oh, Lordy.\n-Oh, my God. -I knew it.\n-Uh-huh.\n-Yeah. (grunts softly) The first time we did this\nnegotiation, it was four people have to sit out or two votes\ngiven up at tonight's Tribal. But there were ten of you.\nThere's only eight of you now. It's still four people\nto sit out or two votes, which means\nthe price has gone up. Anybody interested\nin stepping out? Four people gets you enough rice to get you all the way\nto the end of the season. I mean, I'll step out. PROBST:\nKenzie's one. (groans) Liz thinking about it. Y'all think you can win this? All right, let's make this\na little more interesting. If you can't come up\nwith four people for the group, then any individual\nwho wants to step out... ...your own individual\nportion of rice. -It's not a lot...\n-Aha. ...but there's enough there\nto stave off that hunger. Would you guys hate me? -TIFFANY: No. No.\n-Get the rice, Liz.\nThat's yours. -TIFFANY: Girl, go ahead.\n-That's all you. -That's your coconut.\n-All right, well, I'll step out. So Liz is interested\nin the individual rice. Well, I mean,\nif two other people want to step out, but I know this is, like, really high stakes. So let's just find out. Is there anybody here that's even contemplating it? No. PROBST:\nQ? No? If I step out, I go home. I'm not dropping that bucket. PROBST: So, if we\ndon't make a deal today, it's safe to assume\nwe're probably -not going\nto make a deal this season.\n-Yeah. -All right,\nKenzie, you've stepped back.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. So you're gonna compete. If the whole group was in it, I was gonna go for it,\nbut I think I'll be able to make it without the rice\nbecause I can eat coconut. So I'm not judging Liz at all. I'm like, \"Get the rice, girl.\" I would judge you more\nif you didn't, honestly. -I would be like, \"Just do it.\"\n-PROBST: Liz, your entire tribe is saying \"Go for it.\" They know you're hungry.\nYou have allergies. You've not been eating much. All right,\nI'm gonna take the rice. -PROBST: All right, Liz.\n-Good job, Liz.\n-Crab fried rice. Take a spot on the bench.\nHere's your rice. Good job, Liz. -My baby.\n-PROBST: All right,\neverybody else, take your spots. We'll get it on. Let's do it. \u266a \u266a All right, Liz opted\nfor the individual rice. Everybody else is competing. Here we go.\nPut your hands on your handle. You're gonna pull it back,\nand you'll hear a click. Go for it. This challenge is on. No way to convey\nhow difficult this challenge is simply by looking at it. Giddyap, baby. This hurts. It's 25% of your weight on day one,\nso there's a lot of variables. How much weight have you lost? How much strength\ndo you still have? Venus slowly dropping. Venus is out, joins Liz.\nWe're down to six. -LIZ: I'm sorry, boo.\n-Look how sweaty my hands are. Jeff, give me\na Van Halen quote, please. -When your bucket drops,\nit's bottoms up.\n-(Ben laughs) Let's hope\nthe cradle does not rock. (rock guitar plays) PROBST:\nBeen some crazy Tribals lately. You want that necklace. Ah! Ah! Ben, you got this. I'm doing my best.\n(grunts) Ben dropping a little\nbut trying to wrench it back up. \u266a \u266a Kenzie getting hers back up. It's going. I can't. (strains) PROBST: Looks like Ben is gonna\nbe the next one out. -He is. Ben is out.\n-(exhales) Take a spot on the bench.\nWe're down to five. New energy now. \u266a \u266a You've been up there\nsix minutes. -VENUS: Yes, Kenzie.\n-Oh, my God. Longest this challenge has gone\nwas Mike Gabler, 38 minutes. He went into outer space. Channeling all his friends,\npeople he was playing for. CHARLIE:\nThe state of Alaska? (laughs) Whatever it takes\nto keep you in this challenge. Kenzie gets her bucket back up. Q fighting it off. PROBST:\nQ dropping a little more. Q's lost\na lot of weight out here. His pregame body weight\ncoming into play here. He's got a lot of weight\nin that bucket. \u266a \u266a Q working hard to keep\nthat bucket from dropping. You never know\nwhen it's you going home. -(chuckles)\n-Oh, he knows. Oh, he knows. PROBST:\nQ continues to, inch by inch,\nget closer to being out of this challenge. \u266a \u266a Maria's struggling a little now. No struggle, Jeff. No struggle. Maria adjusting. -Thank you.\n-LIZ: Correct. BEN:\nAll right, Maria. -PROBST: Kenzie's bucket\nstarting to lower now.\n-(strains) -PROBST: Q drops. He's out.\n-BEN: Whoo! Q will not have\nimmunity tonight. And we are down to four. (Kenzie groans) Kenzie drops. Kenzie's out. -We're down to three.\n-LIZ: Good job. -Good job, Maria.\n-PROBST: Maria drops. And we got a showdown. -Charlie and Tiff.\n-LIZ: Good job, girlfriend. VENUS:\nYou're amazing, Maria. Tiff's bucket\nhas not moved at all, ever. \u266a \u266a 21 minutes you've been up here.\nThat is a long time. Charlie adjusting his grip. Trying to wrench\nthat bucket up a little. Charlie going to one hand.\nThat is risky. Yeah, I don't know\nif I want to do that again. That bucket drops a little,\nbut Charlie pulls it back up. Tiff, rock solid. -Tiff is locked in.\n-This is gonna be a minute.\n(sputters) -Tiff has not budged.\n-Mm-mm. PROBST:\nTiff absolutely locked in. -Charlie adjusting again.\n-MARIA: There you go, buddy. KENZIE:\nYou're locked, Tiff. LIZ:\nYeah. Whoo, girl. PROBST:\nTiff quiet like a statue down on the end. LIZ:\nNo need to look over. -Oh.\n-PROBST: She's barely moved or changed\nher body position at all. If your concentration lapses for even a moment,\nthat's all it takes to drop. \u266a \u266a LIZ:\nMm. -That gives Charlie some hope.\n-MARIA: There you go, Charlie. Charlie trying\nto get that bucket back up. Get it up there, Charlie. -There you go.\n-PROBST: Charlie pulling\nhis bucket back up. Look at that surge of energy. -Wow.\n-KENZIE: Damn. -LIZ: That's Nuinui.\n-VENUS: Wow. Suddenly a burst from Charlie. Let's go, Charlie. PROBST:\nTiff looks down. Really? -Tiff, out of nowhere, drops.\n-Whoa. Charlie wins his second\nindividual immunity. -Safe tonight at Tribal Council.\n-(cheering) -Guaranteed\na spot in the final seven.\n-KENZIE: Tiff, are you okay? PROBST:\nTiff gave everything she had until her body just gave out. You all right, Tiff? You want help up? -Nah, I'm good.\n-Okay. -MARIA: Proud of you, Tiff.\n-KENZIE: You did great. -MARIA: You did a great job.\n-PROBST: Wow. You were amazing, Tiff. LIZ:\nGood job, Charlie. -That was epic.\n-VENUS: Good job, Charlie. -BEN: Charlie, you already know.\n-LIZ: Good job, brother.\n-Good job. Charlie, come on over. (whooping) -Once again, back-to-back.\n-(overlapping chatter) That was a battle. You outlasted. (exhales sharply) Safe tonight. Guaranteed a spot\nin the final seven. As for the rest of you,\nafter 19 very tough days of Survivor 46,\nsomebody going home tonight. 11th person voted out will become the fourth member\nof our jury. Grab your stuff.\nHead back to camp. See you tonight at Tribal.\nCongrats. Thanks, Jeff. When I started\n watching Survivor, I saw that grip strength\nis the most important skill for Survivor challenges.

Crest. \u266a \u266a TIFFANY: I was pretty peeved\n that Charlie won immunity because, aside from the fact\n that I just want a chance at wearing\n the immunity necklace, I wanted to be the one to beat Q and send him home. He tried to destroy my game,\n and there's no way under this Fijian sun that I would let that go. I want Q gone. Charlie. Pulling it out. TIFFANY:\n Tonight is an easy vote. Myself, Kenzie, Charlie,\n Ben, Maria, Venus and Liz are all\n on board to send him home. I haven't heard a single person utter another name today\nbesides Q. -Liz with the rice.\n-KENZIE: Whoo! TIFFANY:\nBut when there's idols in play,\n people start to act stupid. I need somebody to make fire,\nhonestly. TIFFANY:\n I have been doing a lot\n of debating about this idol because,\n now that it's out there, I know that the clock is ticking\n on when I have to play it. -CHARLIE: There it is.\n-TIFFANY: Ooh. However, Q kind of blew up his own game and\nhas been causing chaos at camp. He's now the biggest target. He's a strong competitor. He's won the individual reward, and he's proven that, like,\nhe can beat us. Can somebody throw me a coconut? I think I'm gonna\ncrack one open. I'm a betting woman, so I'm putting my chips\n on the table and I'm making a bet. Tonight I'm betting I can keep my idol in my pocket\nbecause Q is going home. MARIA:\n...I'd love to get the idol out. KENZIE:\nYeah, I would\nlove to get it out, too, but if she plays her idol\ntonight, and we all vote Tiff, -it's gonna be really,\nreally bad.\n-Right. But let's just think. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It seems to be\nthat Kenzie is having cold feet. It seems to be that Kenzie\n doesn't necessarily think that this is the right time\n to make the Tiffany move, but if I keep sitting back and waiting\nfor the light to turn green... ...it may not turn green. So I'm gonna have\nto run the red light. You're basically in final six. That's so awesome. As long as y'all not trying\nto blindside me tonight. (both laugh) KENZIE: I have been working on\nthis, like, Tiff blindside thing on the side,\nbut it's just not singing the same heart song\nit was to me. I have no respect for Q. I have no respect for the way\n he's playing the game. And I don't want\n to get out Tiff, who wants to be here,\n for someone who doesn't care. It's like spitting in the face of everyone\n who has ever applied, everyone who has\never tried to be out here, in the face of the jury,\nthat he just doesn't care. It's annoying. TIFFANY:\n I don't know. Probably she giving him\n some type of encouragement -or something. I don't know.\n-Mm-hmm. I'm the easy vote. But you could change that. Like, there are options, but, like,\nyou got to be in the game. I'm in the game. If you want to take Tiff out, there are options\nto take Tiff out. Are you in or are you not in? Q:\n Tonight's vote is life or death, uh, for me. It's gonna be me or Tiff. I go to Vegas a lot,\n and I'm a high roller. I hope tonight I can roll nothing but sevens, and we can send Tiff home. MARIA:\n What are you thinking? Obviously,\nQ is an easy vote, but... I'd love to get the idol out. We can take Tiff out tonight. While it may be hard\nto work with Q, I think we're gonna\nhave to work with Q. BEN:\n I have been thinking\n about this vote. Q is a schemer\n and a bit of a bully, and I want him\nthe hell out of here, but... the argument\n for Tiff being the vote is that everybody\n knows Tiff has an idol, and the idol's more dangerous than Q at this point. I think we got to go\nwith the Tiff blindside. -Okay.\n-Strategically, it's the most... -It's the smartest.\n-Shh. MARIA: Now we have\n four votes to get Tiffany out, but in a game where there\nare eight people left, that's not enough. -This is how we do it.\n-Mm-hmm. Q is down to do Tiff. Okay. MARIA:\nMaybe we don't tell Kenzie. CHARLIE:\nI was thinking the same thing. We've got Q, Ben, me, Charlie.\nThat's four. -Thing is,\nwe need one more solid person.\n-Personally, I think Liz is the better bet out of... -Liz, I don't trust her...\n-But out of Liz and Venus, who do you trust more?\nVenus I don't trust. -She'll cause some random chaos.\n-BEN: Right. MARIA:\n Venus is not somebody\n I could work with, but the whole fight\n that Liz and Q had makes it really hard looping Liz into the plan. We only have\nto get one more vote. I think Liz is better. MARIA: I want Tiffany out,\n and I want it to be today, but Charlie's right. Liz is the key person\n for this plan, and so our plan\nis contingent on the person that has\n a personal vendetta against Q. But at some point you've got to make a move. And this is terrifying. It's terrifying\nbecause it could blow up in my face, but it could\nalso be a game-winning move. (birds chirping) And I agree with that. Ben hates Q. Like, a lot of us don't want Q, but we have one chance. For Tiffany? This is the only night\nthat we can do this. -Okay.\n-And you are the key holder. LIZ:\n Tonight's vote is making\n the wheels turn in my head. I think Maria wants\n to make this bold move for the jury, but I really, really dislike Q. Plus I have\na personal vendetta against Q because he didn't pick me\n for the Applebee's reward. I know Tiff has an idol, and that\n is something to consider. So it's gonna be\n a really hard battle between my mind and my heart. Getting Tiff out with an idol,\n without her even playing it, it's a huge, huge move. On the other hand, voting Q out, seeing Jeff snuff his torch would be just\n as sweet as that juicy, delicious Bourbon Burger.

KENZIE:\nYeah. -LIZ: Are you okay?\n-KENZIE: Yeah. -VENUS: It was on fire.\n-Did you burn your hair? -KENZIE: Yeah. Oh, my God.\n-LIZ: Ooh, I smell it. -VENUS: It stinks.\n-(laughs) -It's all good? Okay.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scared me. Okay. Let's review where the game is. Every single person\non the jury is there as a result\nof a massive blindside. Q, you have been\nan unwitting smoke screen the last two Tribals. So, once again,\nlet's start with you. Did the day center\naround you a lot? A little? So, Jeff,\nover the last three days, um, I've been calm. I lay on the beach.\nIf they approach me, good. If not, I don't bother people. Right now I have no power,\nso I can only put the trust in the people around me. PROBST:\nTiff, this is a different story, 'cause the last two Tribals, everything\nwas swirling around Q. \"Q's going home. Q's going home.\nQ's going home.\" Nope. Still here. TIFFANY:\nI mean, like Q said,\nhe kind of just sat back, minded his business,\nand he has a keen understanding that, at this point,\nit really just is what it is. And today at camp,\nfor probably the first time in quite a while,\nit was actually peaceful. Kenzie, this\nis eerily familiar, though. The last two Tribals,\nthere was this certainty that it was Q going home. Did it feel different today? Today definitely felt different. Q has been, like,\nsuch a good smoke screen for if a blindside\nis gonna get pulled off. But today we were all on a-- pretty much an understanding on\nwhat was gonna go down tonight. So let's go back\nto the reward challenge. -Biggest reward of the season.\n-(whimpers) PROBST:\nQ, you win. You're in charge. You choose Maria,\nTiff and Kenzie. Liz was left out,\nwas frustrated, understandably. It's a long game. She hasn't\neaten, and she let you have it. -(laughs)\n-Q: Yes. -That's fair.\n-LIZ: I mean,\nI said what I said. I said it very loudly\nand very publicly, but I didn't want it\nto be awkward for everyone. So I apologized to Q. That don't mean I'm,\nlike, really that sorry. But, like, Q, you and I,\nwe just can't play together. Q, this is the story. I know, man. (sighs) It's tough, Jeff,\nbut, you know, I put out a plan, and if four others get on board\nand help me out, we'll see where things kind of shake up. But the other folks\nmight just say, \"You know what?\nKick this guy out.\" So, you know,\nit's one of those things where it's not in my control. Ben, is it possible\nthat everybody could jump on board with Q's plan,\nand it's not Q again tonight? Personally,\nI'm just a bit over it, but, uh, if that does happen,\nlike, it's beyond me. 'Cause everybody has seemed\nto have been on, like, \"Q tonight? Q tonight?\" I mean, it's almost eerie how\non board everybody is with that. Charlie, Ben said it. It's almost eerie. You can't not consider\nthe fact that something weird's gonna happen again,\nbecause look across. The last two have been\nabsolute devastating blindsides using Q as the smoke screen. The eerie silence is scary. And I think\nthere was a moment today where I was\nsort of questioning, like, \"Is something going on\nthat I don't know about?\" And what I realized is that, no, the calm is because\npeople are on the same page. So that's what\nI'm hanging my hat on. Maria, let's talk\nabout blindsides at this stage of the game. If you're somebody\nwho pulls off a blindside, you're happy, you're proud.\nYou should be. You hoodwinked somebody.\nThat's difficult to do, but they're different\nwhen you have a jury. I mean, I am sure everybody here is thinking to themselves, \"How can I get\nsomething on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\" Right? Like, there\nare three unfortunate people sitting over there\nwho are thinking to themselves, \"Was this a good move,\nor was it not? Am I gonna award\na vote to this person or not?\" And so a blindside\nright now is huge. That's just not\nthe case tonight, unfortunately. PROBST:\nTiff, let's go back\nto Q for a moment. There's so much energy around\nwhether he should be here or not that I'm curious\nwhen the scales tip and suddenly keeping Q\nbecomes the better move. (laughs softly) Um... PROBST:\nLiz is...\nEverybody's shaking their head. I don't know if keeping Q\nis the better move for anybody. Just based on\nwhat I've been hearing, I don't think\nthat anybody here thinks that Q is best for their game at\nthis particular point in time. Again, for me, Jeff, I can only put out an idea.

        "transcript":"Welcome to Survivor 47. (cheering) Previously on Survivor... I was gonna--\nI was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.\n-Really? -Yeah.\n-Yeah, dude. CAROLINE: The guys fell\n in love with each other. It's a bromance. TK:\n \"I caught you in the act.\" So now I know I can't fully trust him. That scares me. GABE:\n Now I have power. I'm a dragon sitting on top of a pile of gold. AYSHA:\n We saw Rome at the water well. That is just\nsuspicious behavior. You seem emotional. I crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon. (cheering) That's a good-ass coconut. Give me some. They don't like me. Right now I would vote Jon. Jon is playing hard. RACHEL:\n Andy is a ticking time bomb,\n and you don't know when it's gonna explode. First person voted\nout of Survivor 47: Jon. The tribe has spoken. \u266a \u266a It's gorgeous. There, that reminds me\nof Phoenix sunrises. Tribe morale is\n through the roof. You know, if you realize\nyou're on a winning tribe, it feels absolutely incredible. And in the morning we were\n all chilling on the beach, and the first thing\nthat goes through my mind is, I need to go and read\n exactly what that box says because I got the key\n for the Beware Advantage. And so, last night... ...I dug it up,\n and once I opened it... it was pitch black.\n I felt the scroll and I felt the idol. So I said, \"You know what? I need to hide this box.\" After I re-hid the box,\n I started really thinking, I don't think it's actually\nsmart to keep it to myself. Maybe it's actually better if I\nlet someone else know about it. That way they can trust me more. And Teeny-- she's the vibe\n that I'm looking for in an alliance member, someone that I can trust\n in this game one million percent. TEENY: My first thought\n when Rome tells me he has the advantage is,\n\"Damn it.\" Rome was the person\n who everybody wanted out, but it's never that easy. It was pitch black,\n so we couldn't see what he had to do\nto get the idol. All we could do was\n just feel the idol. (chuckles)\nAnd then go back. So that changes the plan that I wanted to do, and now I sort of have\n to work with Rome, but I'm gonna tell Kishan. -Let me tell you something.\n-Okay, go for it. -He found it.\n-(gasps) He found it, and he told me. I don't know why he told me,\nbut he fully found it. -What?\n-He told me, and he showed me where it is. Down-- Oh, oh, come here,\ncome here, come here. Oh, wait, wait, wait.\nThe text. KISHAN:\nOh, so that's what... -Hey.\n-TEENY: Hey. I got caught with a giant box holding\nthe biggest secret of the game wide open. But one of my superpowers, I feel, is being able to talk my\n way out of any situation. I just want to say,\nlike, I told him because I want to work\nwith this four. -Okay.\n-Like, and that's, and that's something\nI should have discussed with you and, like, would have,\nbut I got excited about the box. That's the truth. ROME:\n When I saw them at my box, I'm thinking, like,\n \"What are you doing?\" Like, 100%, I don't know\nif I can trust Teeny as much as I could yesterday. When I was finally able to read what was in this box\nwith them, I was so disappointed. This box said,\n \"You can take it right now, \"and it's good\n for one Tribal Council, \"or you can take this other\n note, do another thing, and then your idol is good\nfor three Tribal Councils.\" What about a normal idol? I took the idol\n that's good for only one, and I played it safe. TEENY:\nYeah, that's why I was like... ROME: Now they both know,\nguaranteed, Rome is not gonna be the first one gone from Lavo,\nand that is a great feeling. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a GABE:\nLook at that. Oh. GABE:\nHuge crab. Oh, my God, should we grab it? (Caroline squeals) Oh, my gosh. TIYANA:\nYeah, the pinchers are huge. GABE:\nOh, I got him,\nI got him, I got him. SUE:\nOh, my goodness. TIYANA:\nGabe has caught the biggest crab I think I've ever seen\nin my life. -TK: That's a boy.\n-SUE: Let's go. That's-- need that right there.\nThat's a good start to the day. SUE:\nI'm gonna head back,\nthough, I'm sweating. GABE:\nFound a whole beach over here. TK:\nOh, my God. -It's like you're in heaven.\n-This is crazy. -Yeah.\n-(laughs) -Wow, this is kind of wild, man.\n-If only heaven wasn't\n90 degrees and humid. TK: I came into this game\n knowing that I wanted to at least bring\na strong three to the merge. -Can't see that.\n-The wave that's breaking -right there?\n-Yeah.\n-Yeah. Wow. Kyle is my number one. Honestly,\n he seems super genuine. I trust this guy\nwith my life right now. Gabe, you need to talk\nto some people 'cause I-I know... I don't think\nanybody's mentioned, like, \"Oh, I got a really good\nrelationship with Gabe\" yet. -Yeah. -TK: Gabe-- \"idol-hunting Gabe\"-- was initially the strong part of\n our three, but he's been playing\n a very erratic game. You don't have to have,\nlike, a strategy talk, just... Yeah, yeah, start forming\nthat relationship. TK:\nAnd I don't want to have my game hanging on the heels\n of somebody else who, right now, I can't, quite\nfrankly, trust all the way. Oh, look,\nall these hermit crabs. -Those two.\n-Yeah, yeah. I've been wanting\n to talk to Tiyana for some time\n because I think she has a better ability\n to actually connect with people, something that Gabe has not been doing\non this tribe. No, I was just trying to gauge\nhow you felt about who you felt about here\nthat you feel strongly -like you could\nactually do something with.\n-Right. Obviously I-- looking at it\nright now, I'm, like, worried -about a bromance with you guys.\n-Yeah. I never want to be like,\n\"Oh, okay,\" like, the bromance and then\nI'm the fourth, you know, -'cause that kind of sucks.\n-Yeah, yeah. There's not, like, a bromance\nthing happening right now. TIYANA: I am absolutely\n surprised to hear that TK wants to actually work with me because, so far,\n there's a huge divide when it comes\n to the girls and guys. -Gabe has already been doing\na lot of... -stuff.\n-Right. So, I don't feel comfortable\nwith that. I really like you,\nI really like Kyle, so, if you, me and Kyle\ncan figure out a way for us to just lock down\nus as a three, I'm super comfortable with that. -Straight up?\n-Yeah. I think that's a great idea. Okay, I'm glad\nwe're on the same page. TIYANA: I am elated\n that Gabe actually kind of shot himself in the foot because he went off\n doing sketchy things, and a bromance can only\ngo so far if the bros don't even trust another bro. That's not a bromance. Yeah, Kyle, so, I called Tiya, and you and I talked,\nand I let you know, like, I really bang\nwith your vibe, and you're a cool dude,\nand I trust you, and I would like to have three\npeople that we can all lock in. KYLE:\nThat's how I feel as well. I think that you're\na real good person, and I think that\nthe way that-- that we jive, that there's--\nthere's a longevity to it. -TIYANA: Oh, absolutely, dude.\n-It's-- You know? And I think\nthat we're very valuable -to one another.\n-TK: Hell yeah. TIYANA:\n I really feel like Kyle is a genuine soul, and so Kyle is someone that I think I could\nreally lean on in this game. TK:\nWe can make it work, bro. ANDY: Day three was one\n of the most tumultuous days of my life,\n but now that I'm here and I actually survived\nthe Tribal Council, I just feel like this is such an amazing opportunity\nfor a recovery. I know my role right now,\nin a good way. -It makes me happy.\n-Yeah, it's good. I want to be a lightning rod. I am feeling a lot better\nin a lot of ways, and I feel\n like they're including me, which is the first step\n of improving your position, is having people include you in the social vibe of the tribe. -Let's get it, Andy.\n-Ooh, that's a good one. The layers to Survivor are mind-boggling. Like, Andy wants\n something from us. He wants connection,\nhe wants to feel included. We want something from him. We want him to be\nin a good mindset, we want him to perform\n in challenges, but we also want him\nto be the easy boot. (singsongy):\nHere we go, Andy, here we go. Right now everybody on Gata\n is trying to make Andy feel as part of our group\nas possible. -Yes, we see it!\n-SIERRA: Yeah! (whooping) Let's go...! RACHEL:\nLet's go, Andy! That's the perfect coconut. -Thank you.\n-It is. ANIKA:\n It's very obvious that Andy-- he needs words of affirmation. SIERRA: Yeah, you get on that,\nyou have that. -ANIKA: That's a good one.\n-(Sam whoops) ANIKA:\n I've met a variety\n of different kinds of men on dating apps\n and, specifically for Andy, you can just tell it's giving toxic, clingy boyfriend.\nYeah. SAM:\nI'm looking forward\nto just not doing anything next. ANDY:\nYeah. You know, the thing is, facing death\nand being the first boot and surviving has put me in\na completely different mindset. I have this just\ntotally new game plan. I could never... SAM:\n Right now I'm on Andy duty, like, just keeping\na watchful eye on him at all times because an idol is the\nnumber one thing that is causing paranoia around Gata right now. I don't know,\nI think they went by the rocks. I wonder what they have to talk\nabout for a long time. -Girl stuff.\n-(laughs) -Talking about their hair.\n-Yeah. ANIKA:\nI feel like it's in, like,\na crook of a tree -or it's at, like,\nthe base of a tree.\n-RACHEL: Yeah. RACHEL:\nYeah, I mean, it's this\ntiny piece of parchment, right? I can't find anything ever. I'm like,\n\"Where's my hairbrush?\" What about Beware? Sh-Should I look or no? -Like, I don't think\nyou should, because\n-I agree. -a lost vote right now, like...\n-That's just the... -Yeah.\n-All right. SAM: Andy is an oddball,\nand it would be very easy for me to kick Andy to the curb. -I got you. You know I got you.\n-Let's go. Yeah. SAM:\n But in sports reporting,\n relationships and lines of communication are key. You are just as valuable to me. -Yeah.\n-Heck yeah. I want to be Andy's buoy\n in an ocean where he feels\n like he's drowning. If I can have Andy feeling\n like he can come to me with information, that allows me options because you never know when the athlete who's at the bottom\nof the totem pole is at the top of the totem pole because they're the hero\nin the game. -My mom's gonna love you.\n-Good, I-I-- I'm gonna love your mom. Okay. (sighs) When Sam was gone,\n I'm just left alone and my brain starts spiraling. What's going through my mind is,\n\"Okay, there are some options.\" I could just chill here,\nmake sure that they see me not going off, make sure\n my target doesn't grow. Or put my pedal to the metal and find this advantage. I do not feel\n like I have much time. I feel like Sam and the women will come back to camp,\n really, at any minute. Really, the clock was ticking. SAM:\n I went to the bathroom,\n came back, no Andy. I looked behind me, no Andy. I looked in the bushes, no Andy. Uh-oh. Andy was gone. It's like the babysitter\n takes their eyes off the baby,\n and then, all of a sudden, the house is on fire. (chuckles) Oh... The Beware Advantage gives you a huge decision\n with two options. You can either open it and take that risk or leave it and potentially wait for better timing. (sighs)\nI'm gonna do something new. I'm gonna try it out. I'm gonna leave it for now. I don't think\nanyone else is looking. I'm gonna brainstorm\nwhat I'm gonna do with it. I have an opportunity\nthat not many people have taken. If I know where the-the advantage is, and if and when I need an idol, I can pull the trigger. Everybody thinks\nthey'd be a great player, but there's only\none way to find out. Apply to be on Survivor. Hey, get your head\nin the game, son. The scout from Football College\nis up in the stands. Maybe I'd rather go to school\nfor insurance. I didn't raise no insurance man. But you did, Dad.\nFootball's your passion. But mine is providing\naround-the-clock protection to Progressive customers\nwho bundle home and auto. Jamie, we need you out here\nfor football. You're giving up\non your dream, James. No, Dad. I'm giving up on yours. No, James, wait! Oh, that's not the exit. We a ll k no w co st s ar e to o hi gh . But while corporations\n are gouging families, Trump is focused on\n giving them tax cuts. But Kamala Harris\n is focused on you.

And she'll cut\n housing costs by taking on corporate\n speculators. Middle class families\n built America. We need a leader\n who has their back. I'm Kamala Harris and I\napprove this message.

Make it AREXVY. \u266a\u266a AYSHA:\n Having the camp supplies\n has been everything. We did so much with\nnothing for three days, and now we have an axe,\n we have a saw, we have a hammer,\n we just got flint. AYSHA: So, of course, Rome needs to be\n the person in charge. AYSHA: He wanted to be the first one\nto make fire. I tried. I was good\nat, like, sparking it, but I couldn't-- I wasn't\ngreat at building it up. ROME:\nYeah, I made a fire\nevery single morning till I came out here. So, my record is 16 seconds\nto get a fire. -(Rome laughs) -KISHAN: I think\n Rome's a showman. That's what he does for\na living. He's a commentator. This looks incredible. KISHAN:\n He has a bucket list he came in with. He wants to make the fire. He wants to be the one\n finding the idol. He loves the big, flashy moves. AYSHA:\nTry scraping, if you can. -ROME: Oh, wow. That's\n-AYSHA: Yeah. way different with a machete. KISHAN:\n My strategy-- it's completely the opposite of that. I think the more low key\n you are, the better, because, you know, you skate\n under the radar. ROME:\nI mean, I think that's enough. AYSHA:\nNope. Right there, right there! -Yes! Kishan! Oh, my goodness.\n-KISHAN: Yes. -There we go, baby.\n-Yes. Besides, he didn't make the fire.\nI made the fire. KISHAN: Yeah! SOL: I've never, ever met anybody like Rome. -(chortles) -SOL: Rome is... He's a lot. Definitely had, like,\naspirations to go, like, to the NBA.\nI did not have the height,\nbut I had the speed. -Like--\n-Why didn't you get drafted? I stopped playing. I stopped\nplaying in high school. TEENY: He is just a little bit cocky. I always knew, like,\non the low, I could probably be a rapper\nif I really wanted to. \u266a It's been a couple years,\n couple stories \u266a \u266a A couple smiles. \u266a\nUh... uh... Like, I forgot it\nin my head now. Yeah, I always wish\nthat I taught myself all the Michael Jackson moves. That, like...\nDo, like, that. AYSHA: You want to be -the one from our season?\n-ROME: Yeah. TEENY: When you're spending sunrise to sunset with somebody, it's impossible to ignore it. (imitates screeching\nconnection tone) -(laughs) -TEENY: It's tempting to just want to get him out of here,\n but Rome has an idol. If he didn't have it,\nhe'd be the easy first boot. So, Rome, right now-- he's\ngoing to be the problem for me. -I mean...\n-(Aysha and Teeny exclaim) (Rome laughs) Andy left.\nHe went looking. I-I go to the bathroom.\nI come back, he's gone. ANIKA: Sam was babysitting Andy\n because we need to make sure that\nhe has no chance of finding\n any sort of advantage. That could mess up\nour whole entire plan. I don't think he found anything. I need to make sure that we find it before Andy.\nSo I suggest to Sam... What if went--\ngo looking right now? Okay. Anika and I go off under the guise of filling up waters for everybody,\n which very quickly turns into a full-on idol hunt. (groans) SAM:\n You get out here, it is a massive, massive island. And you're looking\n for something about yea big. Like, this tree looks like\na great spot, but... ANIKA:\nI don't think they would\nput it in this spot. Yeah. Yeah, you took it, you took it.\nYou got it. SAM:\n I'm taking it. There wasn't really\n a second thought. Like, get the idol. Get yourself\nmore power in this game. ANIKA:\n What's going through\n my head is, \"Thank God I was there with him.\" Head straight to the path. ANIKA:\n Sam is already a threat\n without this advantage. This advantage only makes him\neven more of a threat. (exclaims) -That's a lock.\n-That's it, -that's it, that's it.\n-I think this is a clue. ANIKA:\n We find a map, and there's a red X where the key could be,\n and it's pointing to the set of trees\n near the water well. So, we go, sprinting. We're also carrying\nevery single person's water bottle at this point. (laughs) Like... -That they're bringing.\n-The-- Oh, I know. Hopefully they come back.\nI'm, like, thirsty. -You got it? Got it?\n-This rope. -SAM: Oh, yeah. -ANIKA: I find a rope, and then we pull out this rope to only discover... -Oh, my God.\nThere's a lot of this.\n-Okay. ...that there are maybe 300... knots tied next to each other. SAM:\nDude, there are so many. We kind of realize that this is going to take a very long time. We've been gone for a while. -Yeah. -SAM: This cannot be done right now.\nI will have to find time to come back\n and complete this later. But Anika being there with me is, like, a nightmare.\n I don't want to have a secret with Anika\nthat I'm not telling Sierra. Holy crap, bro.\nLet's go. Sierra is my number one, and I don't want her\n ever thinking I'm withholding\na major piece of information from her.\n Had I found it by myself, maybe it's a different story. I don't love that Anika knows. SIERRA:\nI don't love that either. Because if Anika knows,\nI'm worried that Anika's gonna tell Rachel, and then\nthat looks bad on me. -I don't know\nif she's gonna tell Rachel.\n-Okay, she's probably\ngonna tell Rachel. Okay. Pretend that\nyou don't know anything. SAM:\n Anika knowing\n complicates things, because if Anika has already told Rachel,\nI need to tell Rachel myself. I need your help. Where'd you find it? There's a bunch of knots\naround the roots -of those trees\nin the back left.\n-Okay. -A ton of knots.\n-Let's go. SAM:\n Because if Rachel\n finds out from Anika and I'm still lying about it\n to Rachel's face-- bad, bad look for me. RACHEL: Oh, my God. This is crazy. ANDY:\nIt's only been a few hours since\n I found this Beware Advantage. So, I'm thinking, \"Okay, maybe I should just go for it\n and go get this thing.\" For a player like me,\n in this position, an idol would mean\na hell of a lot. And so now I feel like\n it would be optimal for me to go ahead\n and grab this. You know, it is\na ticking time clock. Someone could find it. And so I go\n to my secret hiding spot. I'm thinking I kind of forgot which branch it was on. I see the branch where it was. (groans) It is not there. And I am overcome with a sense of panic. Oh, this is not good. What I thought was\n a safety net is not only gone and out of my hands, but is in the hands\n of somebody else. RACHEL:\nLet's go! -There we go.\n-Oh, my God. There we go.\nWe got it. Finally, Rachel and I get to the key to unlock the box. Um, I'm not\nfeeling good right now. I have to think about things. Oh, boy.\nOh, boy. -Okay, let's talk.\n-Okay. ANDY:\n Sam-- he is my one foothold to get back into this game. And so my gut is saying I can trust him. So, like, two hours ago, I found but did not take\nthe Beware Advantage. -You found it?\n-Yeah, but I didn't take it. -Oh, you left it?\n-Yeah. Didn't want-- I didn't want to lose my vote.\nSo, I stashed it. SAM:\n I was in musical theater,\n and it's not for my singing. Like, I can act a little bit,\n but I was not ready for the bomb that Andy\nwas about to drop. SAM:\n He says one of the girls found the Beware Advantage.\nMusic to my ears, Andy. I think you're right. They're up to no good. They've got something. Damn. -I think it's okay. -ANDY: With Sam, I am telling him this\n valuable information in order to build\nthe trust I need. I feel kind of bad\nbecause I'm sitting there with the key in my sock. But as silly as Andy might feel losing a Beware Advantage,\n he took a huge leap of faith coming to me\nwith this information. -I trust you.\n-Yeah, dude, I got you, 100%. This is starting\n to make me feel like I can actually trust Andy\nmoving forward. TK: Now, obviously, us three and Gabe are probably set\nto not be gone early. Uh, so, I just want to see w--\nif we're really-- if we could gauge this out.\nIf we were to say right now, if we lose next challenge, who do we think\nin this situation we're going? It's, like,\na toss-up between, like... TK:\n Sue and Caroline.\n I just don't think Sue brings anything to the table. Gabe. -I'm moving slow today.\n-TK: It's-it's all good.\nTake your time, bro. GABE: TK, Kyle, and Tiyana-- I think they all think\n I'm kind of just a quiet guy and I really\nhaven't found my place, socially, with everybody. We were just trying to figure\nout, you know, generally... GABE:\nUh-huh. ...how we were thinking\nabout the other two. -GABE: Yeah.\n-But I don't know. Yeah. I'm down with it. TK:\nThe-- This is the four, bro. Yeah, yeah.\nI'm totally cool with that. They pitched the idea to me\n of \"this is our four,\" and I think that they believe that\nI'm in with them. This is our four.\nThis is our four. But that four is not my four. Caroline and Sue\n are way more attractive to me as alliance partners\n than the other three are. We need to put something\nin our stomachs. GABE:\nThey're on the bottom right now. These are wounded birds,\n and I want to bring these birds in,\n 'cause people who feel like they're on the bottom--\nthey're desperate. Me and Sue are pretty locked in\n as number ones. So, the next wounded bird\nI need to go get is Caroline. I think TK and Kyle\nare way closer with each other than either of them\nare with me, and the only person\nI've talked any s-- real strategy with is Sue. I feel like\nyou're a genuine person. I really want to work with you. You, me and Sue-- -we can run this thing.\n-Okay. I have zero\nworking relationship with Gabe. I just graduated\n from business school. I'm not an idiot. I don't\n believe him for a second. So, I have no trust\nin him whatsoever. I want to work with you. -Mm-hmm.\n-We have a lot of potential. -Uh-huh. Yeah.\n-It's not here yet. But I don't feel like\nI have that thing where I can, like...\nI don't know. It's just not clicking -Yeah.\n-as much as I want it to. GABE:\n I'm surprised by just\nhow skeptical Caroline is of me. And I know I have to squash\nthat as soon as I possibly can. So, at that moment,\n I make the call to pull my idol out\n and show her. (mutters) Yeah, that's it. And then he shows me his idol. Hey, good job. -It's huge.\n-Thank you. CARLOLINE:\n This is such a weird\n show of trust. So, I actually think maybe there's a world where\nGabe and I can work together. -He told me he has it.\n-Yeah? -He has the idol.\n-Okay. -He told me, too. Okay.\n-Oh, my God. -Okay, okay, okay.\n-So... -Interesting.\n-Yeah. I want to be cautious, but I'm optimistic. But I-I definitely\nthink we're good. I mean, I think\nas long as me, you and Gabe can stay strong,\nwe're gonna be okay. Nobody knows that Caroline, myself, and Gabe are in an alliance. And I think that's a big deal. How are you guys feeling? SUE:\nI'm-I'm really excited. Yeah. I agree. I like it. I have Sue and Caroline. They're my little birds, right?\n And I'm gonna make 'em warm. I'm gonna make 'em feel\n good and safe. -CAROLINE: How are you\nfeeling, Gabe?\n-Feel good. Feel like I'm in a good place. Yeah, you are.\nYou are. GABE:\n And if I can sit at\n the end with Caroline and Sue, write me the check. Th ur sd ay N ig ht F oo tb al l on P ri me . It 's o n. Re ad y to h av e so me f un ? Ye ah , le t' s do i t.

Hopefully we'll have a down day\non the beach -and I can fall asleep, right?\n-KYLE: Yeah. SUE:\n Sometimes we need a nice break from the game.\n So, Tiyana, myself, TK and Kyle-- we all felt like we needed to take, like,\nan hour or so nap on the beach. It's much more comfortable\nthan our bamboo. The reason I don't like Florida,\nto be honest with you, bro, is there's too much wildlife out\nthere that can kill you, bro. I'm good off of that. -Aw...\n-I just-- Godzilla comes\nout the bush, bro. Like, the biggest alligator\nI've ever seen in my life, bro, comes out the bush. -Godzilla.\n-That was Godzilla, bro. You can't tell me\nit wasn't, bro. Like, yeah, bro.\nOh, yeah, bro. Yeah, that's crazy, bro.\nSo, if you want to go... SUE:\n But TK didn't stop talking the whole time. Bro, Super Bowl was in Vegas last year--\nOr this-- this February was in Vegas. And, bro, it was\nso many people there, bro. Like, Big Bear is fire, bro.\nIt's, uh... 'Cause that's why\nI like Cali, bro. 'Cause you can\nliterally get anything... -Influencers, bro.\nHe's not fighting real fighters.\n-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.\n-You know what I mean? Like... SUE:\n I'm trying\n not to be annoyed at TK, but two people\n are trying to sleep and he's just talking loud. And it's just that overpowering male dominant -bro energy. -Yeah, just, like, come in and get me\nout of there, bro. Like, this has got to be some\nbackhand strategical move, bro. SUE:\n These bastards,\n they don't even realize that I am somebody\n to begin with. I have the best job ever\nout of all of them. I'm a pilot and I'm a--\nYou know, own a flight school. It's just such\n a lack of respect. And it's just\n very frustrating. I wanted-- I couldn't wait\nfor them to leave. It's so frustrating.\nJust annoying. -Like...\n-Yeah, it's so annoying. I can't fall asleep\nwith people talking. -It just. No, it's impossible.\n-Exactly. SUE:\n Tiyana knows I can't stand TK and she agrees with me,\n but I can't tell if she's just\nsaying that to \"yes\" me or if she believes it. TK is, like,\none of those people that... I don't have\na solid read on him. I wish I got to\nsleep in all day. TIYANA:\n I don't think I vibe with him as a person.\nBut the thing is... (sighs) ...me, TK, Gabe and Kyle-- that four-- we have the numbers.\n And so, I'm game to roll\nwith the big dogs. -Okay, let's get it. -SAM: So, I tell Sierra I have the key.\n And so, the last step is going and getting this box, unlocking the box, and getting my hidden immunity idol. SIERRA:\nLet's go! There's not one part of my body that I'm like, \"I can't\n trust Sam at this point.\" And he wants to include me\nin everything. That, to me,\n is, like, friggin' cool. -There.\n-Got the lock? SIERRA:\nIt's here. Yep, right here. SAM:\nGonna get it out. (Sierra laughs) I feel like we definitely have this strong\ntrust now that's truly building. I just wanted to share\n that moment with Sierra as number ones and friends. SAM:\n We run off to the water well\n and we're like, \"Here we go. The moment\nyou've been waiting for, \"where you get an immunity idol on Survivor.\" (Sierra giggling) And we open the box. And there's another box. The idol that\n I've just found is only good for one Tribal Council. I can play it safe\n or I can choose to take on another task and make this idol good for three Tribal Councils. Okay? Let's go! You got it. I decide, \"Let's not get ahead of our skis,\"\n and I grab my very own Survivor hidden immunity idol. Yes. It's mine! (laughs) Sorry. SAM:\n And this is a little guy,\n but I feel like this one's gonna\nbe small but mighty. We can make something happen\nat the next one. Yeah, we're good, we're good. SAM:\n But right now I'm trying to figure out how do I use\n this idol to position myself in the best spot possible.\n I'm trying to think a couple of steps ahead. Hear me out. Is it crazy\nif I play it on Andy? -I-I hope you can understand\nthat I'm, like, nervous\n-Yeah. -about going to four with\nthe three girls and myself.\n-Okay. Yeah. I think that's the right move. SIERRA:\n I do not love the idea\n of working with Andy. I think he's very unpredictable.\n But if Sam's pulling, you know, Andy's way, I'm sticking with Sam. I think, surprisingly,\nAndy has, like, a decent head\non his shoulders right now. Survivor is never\nas simple as it seems, and you got to make big moves to advance in this game,\n and I-I think I might be on the cusp of having\nto make a really big move.

Tuku and Lavo,\ngetting your first look at the new Gata tribe. Jon voted out\nthe last Tribal Council. GABE:\nWhat? ROME:\nWow. Oh, my God. Huge reactions. Wow. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? (all voicing assent) First things first.\nRome, Sue, -got to take it back.\n-I ain't taking\na step toward you. -SIERRA: She's hiding.\n-Come on, give it up. Don't make me pull out my knife. (laughing) -Spicy.\n-Savage. Once again,\nimmunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're gonna jump into the ocean\n and race to a tower where you will retrieve\n a large bag of rice. You're gonna then work together\n to get that bag of rice through a very small hole\n and ashore, where one person\n will stand behind a cage door and maneuver a key\n through a maze. Once you have the key, unlock the door, tear open your bag of rice and retrieve a ball,\n where finally, three tribe members will attempt\n to maneuver that ball through a winding snake track. First two tribes\nto finish win immunity. In addition,\nyou're playing for reward. Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? (all voicing assent) (cheering, applause) -(indistinct chatter)\n-Let's go. Let's go. PROBST:\nFirst tribe to finish-- a massive Survivor fishing kit. -(whooping)\n-ANIKA: Oh, my God. Second tribe to finish, smaller,\nbut this will do the job. SAM:\nYeah! -(whooping)\n-PROBST: Last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers--\nI got nothing for you but a date with me\nat Tribal Council where somebody will be the second person voted out\nof Survivor 47. As a penalty for losing,\nI will take your flint. Gata, you are working\nto get yours back. All right, we have sit-outs. Lavo, you have one extra person.\nSitting somebody out. You cannot sit out\nthe same person in back-to-back challenges.\nWho's it gonna be? -It's gonna be Aysha.\n-PROBST: Aysha. -Tuku, who's it gonna be?\n-Me. PROBST:\nSue. All right,\nwe have our sit-outs. Everybody else,\ngive you a minute to strategize. We'll get it on. Let's do it. -(cheering)\n-Go, guys. (whoops) PROBST:\nAll right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! -Everybody in the water at once.\n-SUE: Go, Tuku! PROBST:\nYour first job is\nto get that very heavy bag of rice down from the platform. AYSHA:\nGo, Lavo! PROBST:\nTuku heads up first. There goes Gata. Andy's got it. Rome has it for Lavo. Ready? It's heavy. Don't drop it. PROBST:\nTiyana and TK have it for Tuku. Put the weight on my head. -I got it, I got it, I got it.\n-You got it? PROBST:\nIt's Lavo in the early lead now\nwith their bag of rice. I got rough footing out here. PROBST:\nYou got to get everybody\nto that next obstacle -before you can start over.\n-AYSHA: Come on, Lavo! Lavo, you're good. -We're good, we're good.\n-Gata, you're good. Tuku, you're good. The rice is going\nthrough the hole. The players are going\nover the obstacle. PROBST:\nLavo working quickly\nwith that bag of rice. -Here we go.\n-Yup, back and forth. AYSHA:\nGood job, let's go! -You can drop. You can drop.\n-PROBST: Rome, going for style points. -You good?\n-PROBST: Lavo has their\nbag of rice through very fast. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! PROBST:\nGata has their bag of rice. They're heading out. -Nice. Here we go.\n-Yup. PROBST:\nTuku has their bag of rice. They're heading over\nand through. (grunting) PROBST:\nYou got to get everybody to the mat\nbefore you can move on. You got it, you got it, Andy. You're good, Lavo.\nIt's gonna be Rome on the maze. Here comes Gata.\nRachel's got to get there. You're good, Gata. -You guys are great.\n-PROBST: You're good, Tuku. It's gonna be Tiyana for Tuku, Rome for Lavo, Rachel for Gata. You guys are great. PROBST:\nYou're doing this blind. You're trying to find the hole and then get the key\nthrough hole. KYLE:\nMake a grid with your mind. PROBST:\nYou don't know\nif you're making progress until you get there. GENEVIEVE:\nGood job, Rome. -We got your back.\nYou're doing great.\n-Go, Rome! PROBST:\nYou'll know\nwhen you hit a dead end. PROBST:\nIt's much more difficult\nwhen you are blind. SUE:\nCome on, Tiyana! Let's go! -Oh!\n-PROBST: Rachel has it,\ndrops her key. SAM:\nYou got it. You got it,\nyou got it. PROBST:\nNow you can unlock. PROBST:\nNow Gata-- they have their key. PROBST:\nNow Rome feeling the pressure, Tiyana feeling the pressure. Wait, wait.\nKeep going, keep going. PROBST:\nRachel has the door open. Drop that bag on the table. Andy has the rice. Gonna use\nthat knife. Watch your hands! -Yeah, like the coconut.\n-Just like that coconut. -Yeah, baby. Go!\n-(whooping) -Tear it open.\n-SIERRA: Rip it\nlike that coconut. PROBST:\nAndy now looking for that ball. -Rome has it for Lavo!\n-Yes! He can unlock that door. It's\nnow Tiyana who's gonna feel it. -Yes!\n-Andy has the ball. It is Gata in the lead, something they are definitely\nnot used to. -Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.\n-GENEVIEVE: I don't know what that means, but it sounds great. -Ah! Ah!\n-(whooping) -PROBST: Rome has the door open.\n-Come on! Drop that bag on the table. PROBST:\nTiyana still working for Tuku. Come on, Tiyana! -SIERRA: Don't stress.\n-SAM: All right. -We ready?\n-PROBST: Sierra, Sam and Anika. And this will take a lot\nof teamwork and a lot of communication. It's a very delicate move\nyou're trying to make as you guide that ball\nalong this winding track. There is a massive\nlearning curve to this challenge because it requires all\nthree players to work together. There are a lot of bogeys. Those holes\nyou've got to get around. Don't overdo it there.\nWe want it to stop right here. PROBST:\nLooking for that ball.\nHe's got it. It's gonna be Genevieve,\nRome and Kishan. Yes. Tiyana finally has the key\nfor Tuku. Tuku is through. -Let's go, guys!\n-AYSHA: All right,\nlet's go! Let's go! PROBST:\nKyle gonna open that bag. -I'm going.\n-PROBST: Gata working slowly\non their table. ANIKA:\nWe're learning. I want to eat this. Yeah, me, too.\nI was just thinking. PROBST:\nKyle looking for that ball now.\nHe's got it. Gonna be TK,\nGabe and Kyle for Tuku. AYSHA:\nYou got this, Lavo! PROBST:\nLavo drops.\nThey got to start over. -Let's go on the other side.\n-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. It is a blistering hot day. You're already exhausted. But it comes down to this--\none little ball, a windy little path, and victory\nawaiting you at the end. It is Gata in the lead. Keep it taut. PROBST:\nBut Tuku is now catching Gata. I'm going pressure, you're\ngiving finesse right now. Nice guide, bro. Nice guide.\nWe got it. Easy work. PROBST:\nA little tension,\na little slack. You need more, I give you some. I need some, you got to let go. Guide it at your pace. -You're good.\n-SIERRA: Am I giving slack? Yeah. Yup. Stop when we get\nright before the hole. ANIKA:\nStopping. Sierra, you're calling out\nwhich one's thicker. SIERRA:\nWell, my side. Wait. No. -Left side, left side.\n-SAM: Anika's side, okay. So both of you pull,\nget it to the end. -Let me get this\nto the edge.\n-ANIKA: Yup. When you figure out\nhow to work together on this, it becomes very easy. SAM:\nKeep going, Si. PROBST:\nLavo moving very slowly now, trying to learn\nfrom their mistakes. -GENEVIEVE: Okay?\n-ROME: We're good,\nwe're good, we're good. But we are absolutely\nneck-and-neck now with Gata and Tuku\nat the same spot, same obstacle. -Little bit more, Gabe.\nGive it a little bit.\n-Yup, yup. -Stop, stop, stop, stop!\n-PROBST: Tuku can't navigate it. That's how fast\nthis challenge can change. -Somebody pull. Watch it.\n-PROBST: It is Gata in the lead. -I'm pulling as much as I can.\n-Calm down. Stop! Hey, stop! All right? -What are we doing? Let's go.\n-PROBST: Gata starting to panic. ANIKA:\nOkay, well, I mean,\nI can't pull. Choke up on the rope.\nYou have more rope. Sam, Sam, if I pull it\nany further, it won't go. -Please listen to me.\n-SAM: All right. All right. PROBST:\nTuku moving quickly now, trying to catch Lavo.\nThey can feel the pressure, but somebody's gonna be last.\nSomebody's going to Tribal. -Slack, lot of it.\n-PROBST: Gata is very close to finishing this challenge. There is one spot left. -No!\n-I can't pull anymore. PROBST:\nGata at the last spot. One hole. Can they get past it and drop for the win? SAM:\nYeah. Watch it. Watch it. PROBST:\nVery close. -Oh, my God.\n-We're good. Stop. Stop. And they got it!\nGata wins immunity! Safe from Tribal Council.\nWe're looking for one more. And right now, it is Lavo\ndecidedly ahead of Tuku. -Keep the ring left.\n-PROBST: They have got to move or hope that Lavo -makes a mistake.\n-Very gentle. -ROME:\nAll right, all right, all right.\n-Nice move by Lavo. AYSHA:\nNice recovery. Let's go! That is not gonna fall\nthrough. We just need to... Wait, wait, wait, fellas. Wait. PROBST:\nTuku has dropped\nand has to start again. Now Tuku can feel the panic. GABE:\nI'm telling everybody. -Slow.\n-PROBST: This is it. It comes down\nto this moment right here. ROME:\nOkay, that's good. That's good. They're on the edge, and they're past it.\nCan they drop it for the win? GENEVIEVE:\nYup. Got it. They do! Lavo wins immunity... (cheering) ...sending Tuku\nto Tribal Council where somebody will be the second person\nvoted out of Survivor 47. Yeah! All right, Gata, -immunity is yours.\n-(whooping, cheering) And you earn your flint back. -Yes!\n-Yes! Gata safe tonight,\nno Tribal Council. I will miss you at Tribal. -I know you won't miss me.\n-We won't miss you, Jeff.\n-Promise. I don't take it personally.\nLavo, congratulations. For the second straight time,\nimmunity is yours. Well done.\nAll right, Gata, before I send you out,\nI have a question for Rachel. -Yes?\n-Did I see you putting some rice... in your pocket? You didn't see anything, Jeff. PROBST:\nUnbelievable. Empty your pockets. -Okay. Sorry.\n-SAM: You put rice\nin your pocket? SIERRA:\nDude, what a savage! -(Sierra shrieks)\n-(laughter) ROME:\nOh, my-- -SIERRA: It's in your pockets?\n-RACHEL: Yeah. SIERRA: Well, we were\ntrying to play smart. -ROME: Oh, my God.\n-Yeah, you got to empty 'em. Hey, when I was standing\nat that bag of rice, I thought, \"Maybe I can\ntake some home with us.\" I respect the try. -Thank you.\n-PROBST: Lavo, Gata,\ngrab your stuff. -(whooping)\n-Head back to camp.\nNo Tribal Council tonight. SOL:\nThank you, Jeff. Thank you. That was funny. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: That's a first, Rachel. -(laughing)\n-Hey. All right, Tuku. So, Tiyana,\nI see a lot of smiles. -It's fake.\n-(laughing) I'm trying my best\nto keep positive, you know? I mean, obviously we lost, so we got to stay positive and\nfigure something out, you know? So, it's tough. TK, now you enter the last part\nof the game, the biggest part of the game, when you go to Tribal,\nand you vote somebody out. You haven't had\nto deal with that yet. Can you anticipate\nwhat's gonna be different as you head back to camp? Uh, I mean, honestly, I'm\ngenuinely pissed off right now, so it's hard for me to even\nthink that far right now. I'm just... We got way too many\nsmiles over here for us to lose. I'm just not used to losing.\nI don't hang with people who are cool\nwith losing. I don't... I don't even associate myself\nwith that. If I lose,\nI'm not gonna be happy about it. And, uh, I just want\nto make sure that I have a tribe\nthat has the same mindset, and if we don't,\nthen that's a problem. All right, Tuku,\nTribal Council tonight, where one of you will be\nthe second person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing--\nsorry for you-- I'm gonna take your flint. Thank you. You will have a chance\nto earn this back at your next challenge.\nAll right, grab your stuff. Head out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council. SUE: TK threw Tiyana\n under the bus because he was angry\nthat she was smiling. Before today's challenge, I always thought\n she was with the boys, but the rage on her face\n and the anger just showed that she was so upset with TK,\n and hopefully, that put the nail\nin the coffin for him.

GABE: At the challenge, I saw Tiyana rolling her eyes at everything that TK said, and that changed things a lot for me.\nBecause, initially, I felt like the lines\nwere pretty clear in the sand. And on one side\nof the equation, it was me, Sue and Caroline,\nand nobody really knew about it. And on the other side\n of the equation, it was TK, Kyle and Tiyana. And I thought Tiyana was in\n really tight with the guys. I hope you guys didn't think\nI was like, -\"Yay. Can't wait.\"\n-I can't-I can't-- No. I cannot stress enough\nhow nobody thought that. But I think that what happened at the challenge today\n really put her in an emotional state that is gonna guide\n her decision-making tonight. And if that plays in my favor, then I am all for it. TK: Playing sports my... majority of my life--\n it really just builds this mindset in you\nthat, like, you don't put all this work in\nto go out and lose. For me, man, I just... I don't\n really do well with losing. We got a tribe that should win\nevery single challenge, and we're not doing it. I feel like\n I'm a leader on the tribe, and if y'all gonna be\n on my tribe, everybody needs to have\nthe same mindset that I have. So now, I'm gonna start\ntelling people what we're doing. \"This is the goal, this\n is the plan, let's execute.\" TIYANA:\n I'm not gonna lie. When TK popped off-- like, that hurt,\nand not just because... (mockingly): I'm a dramatic\nlittle woman. I... Like, he basically stood,\nlike, on his high horse and called us all losers. Even if I lose a ballgame, I walk out on the field\nand I slap hands with people, -and I'm like, \"Hey, good game.\"\n-Yeah. Like, the sportsmanship. -Like, for real.\n-KYLE: Yeah. Y'all talking ... about me? -No.\n-No. TIYANA: The fact that TK\ncouldn't take any accountability for the loss as a team-- that pissed me off. T was a little rubbed off\nthat you didn't apologize to her right away. Like, that kind of, like,\nruffled some feathers. Bruh, I don't owe her an\napology, but I don't know, bruh. Like, now I'm starting\nto not trust T. KYLE:\n Tiyana was not\n feeling the respect from TK, and, uh, I think that he should\n have apologized to her. But TK, Tiyana, myself-- they're my ride-or-dies. So, I'm trying\n to keep that together. I just got to make sure\nT's not gonna ... this up. Let me get us together. Maybe\nwe can straighten that out. And it's-it's... The strategy talks-- that's\nthe hardest part of this for me. I can hang out in the jungle. A country boy can survive.\nI'm not worried about it. Hank Williams said it best. But this is the first time that my wheels really had\n to be spinning like this. If you have an issue\nwith anything that I say, -please come to me\nand talk to me about it.\n-Mm-hmm. Like, I don't need you going\naround the circle to tell me, like, that you feel\na certain type of way. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.\n-Talk to me about it. At the end of the day,\nI didn't even see who smiled on the tribe,\nso nothing was pointed at you, him, anybody. Jeff said, \"Damn, Tuku.\nYou guys are smiling. You're going to Tribal tonight.\" -And that's what triggered you?\n-And I said, \"I'm not comfortable\nwith anybody smiling right now.\" But that being said,\nare we straight? -Uh, yes.\n-All right. TIYANA:\n When I came out here,\n I knew that I wanted to be a player that separated emotion\nfrom gameplay. I could not like you,\nbut I could work with you. And I'm...\nand then, I'm just like, \"No.\" TIYANA:\n But it's very, very difficult\n because right now, I'm getting a little bit annoyed\n at TK with his ego. However, strategically, he is a great physical asset\n to have in these challenges. And I know that I have to\nsometimes put the emotions aside if I want\nto get farther in the game. -I just want to make sure\nwe're all good.\n-KYLE: All right. -Yup. No. Ser...\n-Love you. Love you. -We're straight. We're solid.\n-So... We're gonna\nstick to the same plan. Sue: done. TIYANA:\n I do believe that Sue,\n right now, is one of the weaker members\n of the tribe because she can't\n really contribute to physical challenges, and it kind of seems like\nshe's fizzling out on day five. -I'm good for it.\n-TK: I think we stick with Sue. -So we stick with Sue? I'm game.\n-And that'd be the end of it. TK:\n Sue needs to go home. It's not a hard decision\n because Sue doesn't really bring anything\n specifically to the tribe. So, think my game plan\nis working flawlessly right now. I think that's\nthe only way we can play. Myself, Tiyana and Kyle--\n locked in. And Gabe will do\n whatever I need him to do. So, the way that I'm moving these chess pieces around, everybody else\nis playing checkers right now. . They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets. This is what is happening in our country. While Trump is focused on...that Kamala Harris is focused on you. It is important\nthat we move forward and address the needs of the American\n people. Address the housing shortage.

I think Caroline and Sue... -No, no, no.\n-TK: You know? I feel like T is almost more\nlike bro than... With us. Yeah, exactly.\nYeah. No, totally, totally. -All right, so...\n-GABE: I... I think we just go four on Sue. TK thinks that\nit's the three guys plus Tiyana. That's what I need to happen. I need him to think,\n\"Before we go to Tribal Council, \"let me get Gabe in\n'cause he's our fourth vote \"and he's just happy to do whatever we say anyway.\" I think we do that\nand, uh, call it a day. GABE:\n So, TK feels extremely secure\n right now, which will make this\nquite a blindside. If we can pull it off. I'm praying to God you do not\nneed to play your idol tonight. I could play the idol for Sue, but the thing with Tiyana\n has changed things a lot. -This is... Yeah. She's four.\n-Okay. Yeah. Yes. 100%. And I think if we can lock\nTiyana in as a fourth right now, I don't see any reason\n to use my idol tonight. I will have\na ... conversation with her. That's what I was gonna say. You don't know I... Yeah. I will absolutely be like-- -Whatever you got to say\nto make it happen.\n-Okay. All right. Let's go, guys.\nWe rock. CAROLINE: Tonight, I really hope\n Tiyana's on our side, because if we go to a tie,\nand you can't convince anyone to change their votes,\nyou go to rocks. And the two people the\n entire tribe wants gone most-- they're safe. And the odds of the people who are drawing rocks--\n25% chance you go home. It's really risky. -I trust you all wholeheartedly.\n-Oh. Yeah, even if it's a tie. Well, that-that would have\nto put Tiyana, and she's gonna know if she has\nto ... change her vote. All of us have the balls\n to go to rocks. I'm a risk-taker, and I am not gonna cow down to anything. I'm gonna go all out. I don't want anybody to know\nwe've been a threesome, 'cause then she'll know\nwe've been lying to her. -Good.\n-So she's gonna think\nit's us girls. Tiyana doesn't know\n that Caroline, myself and Gabe are in an alliance,\n so the only thing that's gonna have to happen is Tiyana's gonna\n have to jump ship. I feel like, you know,\nI understand -if you don't want to do TK.\n-No. But I feel he-- Taking out the\nbiggest threat would be sick. You... Yeah, it would,\nand it would... -Be epic.\n-It would...\nNo, it would be epic. -Like, we just need the numbers.\n-Yeah. How else are we supposed\nto flip this? -Yeah.\n-Like, then what--\nwe go to rocks? -I will go to rocks.\n-Yeah. Sue wants TK\n to be the next vote. Honestly, it'd be\na ep-epic boss girl move. TIYANA: However, TK and Kyle are really, really,\n really close, so, that's a big problem if it comes into blindsiding TK,\n'cause I'm also blindsiding Kyle,\n and I don't know how I could rebuild\n that relationship. It's really taking a toll. Yeah. As long\nas us three stay together. It's all about if we think\nTiyana will go to rocks or not. I don't think she will. TIYANA:\n It is really difficult\n being in the middle because it does feel like a lot of pressure on my shoulders\nto deliver to people that have put their faith in me. (groans)\nThis waiting. That's the worst part, honestly.\nWaiting around. TIYANA:\n It would absolutely\n make sense for me to vote Sue tonight because TK has strength on his side,\n but I don't want to work with someone\nwho I feel disrespected me. So, it really is this toss-up between emotion and strategy. I can only hope\n that my gut is right, and that I'm trusting\n the right people in this game. No th in g co me s cl os e to t hi s pl ac e in t he m or ni ng . I'm so glad\nI can still come here. You see, I was diagnosed\nwith obstructive HCM. And there were some days\nI was so short of breath. I thought I'd have\nto settle for never stepping foot on\nthis trail again. I became great\nat making excuses. But I have people\nwho count on me so I talked to my\ncardiologist. I said there must be more\nwe can do for my symptoms. He told me about a medication\ncalled CAMZYOS. He said CAMZYOS works\nby targeting what's causing\nmy obstructive HCM. So he prescribed it and I'm really\nglad he did. CAMZYOS is used\n to treat adults with symptomatic\n obstructive HCM. CAMZYOS may improve\n your symptoms and your ability\n to be active. CAMZYOS may cause serious\n side effects, including heart failure\n that can lead to death. A risk that's increased\n if you develop a serious infection\n or irregular heartbeat or when taking certain\n other medicines. So do not stop, start or\n change medicines or the dose without telling\n your healthcare provider. You must have\n echocardiograms before and\n during treatment. Seek help if\n you experience new or worsening\n symptoms of heart failure. Because of this risk,\n CAMZYOS is only available through a\n restricted program. Before taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor about all\n of your medical conditions, including current\n or planned pregnancy. Today with CAMZYOS, I don't\nlose my breath as often. My symptoms have improved, helping me go from\nexpecting less to experiencing more. My name is Mike. And this is my\nCAMZYOS moment. Call your\ncardiologist today and see if a\nCAMZYOS moment may be in\nyour future too. Ok , 50 0 de lu xe g ar de n gn om es . Wo w. I only meant to order five. There's not enough money\nin my account for these. I'm gonna get charged. Two things I just\ncan't deal with. Overdraft charges.\nAnd garden gnomes. But your BMO Smart Advantage\nChecking account gives you an extra day\nto avoid an overdraft fee. Nice to see a bank\ncutting people some slack. Mistakes happen. And we give you time\nto correct them. So, you don't like gnomes huh?\nWhat about that one? That one I like.\nA lot. \u266a BMO \u266a \u266a \u266a (chuckling) Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch,\ndip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual\nat Tribal Council, because in this game,\nfire represents your life. When your fire's gone,\nso are you. That's gonna be the case for one of the six\nof you tonight. So, let's get into\nthese first few days. Sue, did you see\nany natural pairing? It often happens when you have\na group of strangers that you say, \"Oh, I'm from\nthat part of the country\" or \"I'm the mom, too.\"\nDid you see any of that? What I actually saw\nwas a bromance developing, and I felt like\nfrom the very beginning, there were, like, the three guys and the three girls\non the bottom. -Really?\n-Yeah. PROBST:\nTiyana, do you agree with that? I honestly do agree. It seemed like\nthey vibed really well. But also, this is Survivor. Nothing's ever so cookie-cutter.\n\"Oh, boys and girls.\" -Right.\n-So, I really do think that what once started\nas a bromance maybe possibly could be split.\nWe never know. PROBST:\nSo, let me just check\nwith the three guys. Do you agree with that?\nDid you all feel like -you just bonded quickly?\n-Oh, yeah. -I mean...\n-I... I bonded pretty quickly\nwith them. but I also bonded\nwith some girls, as well. I'm not strictly on a bromance\nor a romance or nothing. PROBST:\nTK, one thing Sue said very clearly was,\nthe men were on top, and the women were\non the bottom. She didn't say it was even in her view. TK:\nI think what a lot of that had to do with is maybe she wasn't\nas comfortable initiating conversation like the guys were. If you're kind of just\nin your own bubble, that can make you feel that way. So, Sue, that's\nvery much your problem. That's not my problem\nwhatsoever. I can socialize and be very good\nwith men as well as women. There was a line,\nand you could tell, you know,\nthey wanted to stay strong. TK:\nI just got a question. Has anybody really talked to Sue\nmore than two or three times as far as, like,\ndeep conversation? -Have you?\n-I've tried. I mean, we've tried to have\nconversations. I'm just saying. I'm just asking the question,\nlike, how much did you actually initiate conversation\nwith everyone else? That's the things that\nyou have to do on Survivor, is you have\nto have those conversations. And if you're not, we all know\nby watching the game, things can change. Gabe, it can't\nsurprise you that, already, there's this division\nor misunderstanding or whatever\nit might ultimately be. That's part of the design\nof this game. You take a group of strangers\nand you thrust them into crisis and say, \"Figure it out.\" Yeah. I think that\nin the game of Survivor, there's two kinds of\nrelationships you have, right? There are your\nstrategic relationships and there are\nyour social relationships. And I think that people,\nespecially in early days, they see social relationships,\nand they immediately associate them\nwith strategic relationships. But those two things\naren't always the same thing. PROBST:\nCaroline, is there\na stated philosophy with this tribe when it comes to searching\nfor idols or advantages? There's really only one person\nI can think of who is known as the person for, like,\nyou can tell what they're doing. -So...\n-PROBST: You're all smiling. Do you know\nwho Caroline's talking about? -Yeah.\n-Yes.\n-PROBST: Who is it? -Gabe.\n-Ooh. So, Gabe, is this a surprise\nthat they are onto you? GABE:\nI mean, look, the game says, \"Here's\nan island, and it's yours.\" And this is an opportunity\nto be a kid again. And I like to Tarzan around\na little bit, and, you know,\nI'm not blind to the fact that that's gonna\nraise eyebrows, but I want to be Indiana Jones\nfor a little bit. Let me be Indiana Jones.\nCome on. PROBST:\nGabe, your enthusiasm for that, to me, is the hallmark\nof a new era player. You all tend to wear your hearts\non your sleeves. You're more passionate. We had it with you today, TK. It was different. You were\nfrustrated about the challenge. So, did you have an intention when you said, \"I want people\nto know I'm not happy\"? Absolutely. I think the whole\ngoal of me even speaking out wasn't to single any one person\nout on the tribe, but more to get\neverybody's attention to reinforce the fact that we should not\nbe okay with losing. And we need to understand that\nwe want to win, we need to go as hard\nas we can go and not be happy\nwith being last place and not be complacent\nwith being last place, especially for the fact that\nsomebody's going home tonight because we didn't win. (thunder rumbles) PROBST:\nSo, Tiyana, tonight's vote is the first test of trust. Did you find yourself needing\na little more reassurance? TIYANA:\nOh, absolutely.\nAnd kind of going back to balancing\nsocial and strategic, it's like,\n\"Oh, do I like this person \"and I kind of trust them\nfor them just being themselves, \"or do I trust them\non a strategy level of, like, playing\nthis game with me?\" So, at this point, I'm like, how\nwill the chips fall? You know? So, moving forward in this game, I need to work with people\nthat I can genuinely trust. But also, you never\nactually know who you can trust until whoever's\ntorch is getting snuffed is getting snuffed. And on that note,\nit is time to vote. Caroline, you're up. \u266a \u266a Want to see a magic trick? In one fell swoop, I will make\nyour Survivor dream... disappear. I'll go tally the votes. \u266a \u266a If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. GABE:\nYeah. PROBST: Okay. Playing this for yourself? Yeah. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast\nagainst Gabe will not count. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sue. TK.\nOne vote Sue, one vote TK. Sue.\nTwo votes Sue, one vote TK. TK.\nWe're tied. Two votes Sue, two votes TK. TK. -Hmm.\n-That's three votes TK,\ntwo votes Sue, one vote left. Second person voted out\nof Survivor 47: -TK.\n-Wow. PROBST:\nNeed to bring me your torch. -Good stuff.\n-Sorry, TK. No worries.\nNo worries. (TK groans) TK:\n(exhales) Man. (TK sighs) -TK, the tribe has spoken.\n-All right. PROBST:\nTime for you to go. (sighs) Oh, man. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night. TIYANA:\nGood night, Jeff. Captioning sponsored by\n CBS and TOYOTA.

I'm not sure who...\nMaria for you. Oh, dear. I lost my vote... Not great. ...because I didn't know\n the order of the logos. You got this, Q! PROBST:\nFor the win. There it is! Yanu wins their first immunity challenge\nof the season, sending Siga to Tribal Council\nfor the first time. Okay. CHARLIE:\n Maria and I are\n at that crossroads. Yeah. Yeah. CHARLIE:\n We can go with the women or we could go with the men. Fifth person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Jem. The tribe has spoken. JEM:\n This is a total\n blindside tonight. With an idol in my pocket.\n(groans) \u266a \u266a MORIAH:\n In a word, that sucked. Unbeknownst to me,\neveryone was out for Jem. And I wrote down Ben, someone who's been, honestly, pretty kind to me\n this whole game, so, it just sucks\nto be on the wrong side of not only a vote,\nbut the first vote. And on top of that, a blindside by people\nyou think you can trust. Don't sweat it, dawg. Feel like an idiot, but at least\nI'm a living idiot, so... CHARLIE:\nYou're definitely\nnot an idiot, Mo. MORIAH:\n It's, like, I would rather\nbe a living fool-- which I kind of am right now-- than, you know,\na dead know-it-all. And, Mo, I just\nwant to say, you know, I totally think you're valuable in this tribe. -Mm-hmm.\n-TIM: Nobody wrote your name. -BEN: Yeah.\n-You know what I'm saying? Like, that's... that's valuable. MORIAH:\nI'm appreciative that I'm here, and I really am Siga strong. I'm feeling conflicted inside. I mean, they lied to me. I was out of this vote,\n but at the same time, I did not see my name\n a single time. So that tells me maybe there's still room\nfor me to grow in this game. Otherwise, I got\na Shot in the Dark burning a hole in my pocket. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a KENZIE: It took Yanu a really long time\nto get our stuff together, but once we got it, we got it. Just, like, reigniting\n the fire this morning, and it caught in three seconds-- like, that's how we're doing. We finally have a... that spark\nthat's gonna keep us going. Thank you. -Oh, my God.\n-You want to open it? -Oh, my God.\n-TIFFANY: This is,\nlike, a real note. Let's see. (Tiffany screams) -Told you!\n-(Tiffany and Kenzie scream) I thought-I thought we had... This lovely piece of paper says, \"Drop your Buff. We're taking you\nto your new home.\" And if you watch Survivor, you know what that means. Merge, baby. -You were good to us\nwhile it lasted.\n-Kinda. No, he wasn't. TIFFANY:\n To make it with the people that I actually wanted\n to make it with-- my best two pals-- oh, my God. It's, like,\nthe best feeling ever. Giddyup, baby. Let's go play. TIFFANY:\n And, of course,\n we cannot forget our biggest ally, Adelisha,\nwho I keep in my bra. She is not going anywhere, and I feel like\nshe's really gonna help us out\nwhen we get to this new beach. Oh, my God! (chanting):\nMerge! Merge! Merge! Merge! TIM:\n We're headed to a new camp. We don't know what's in store. TIM:\n And right now,\n we are Siga strong. Five. But in my opinion, Mo's still on the bottom, so, if it comes to a point\n where we have to eat our own, it would be Mo. We're going in stronger\nthan we were last night. MARIA:\nThat's right. I am elated. In theory, there's\n a pretty likely chance I am the bottom of this five. But when the game changes, so do your relationships. And if I don't got four friends\nrooting for me here, I might have four enemies, and that's not gonna get me far\n in this game. You know, go with the devil you know\nover the devil you don't. HUNTER: \"Drop your Buffs. Your fellow castaways\nwill be joining you soon.\" (screams)\nI knew it! Oh, my... God. -Drop your Buffs!\n-Oh, my God! HUNTER: We got tree mail today,\n and when we open it, I see that\nit's the \"Drop your Buffs.\" Like, it's happening now, which is exciting, but for me, it starts a timer. And so, I run like I'm doing a little airplane down the beach so that my tribe buys that Hunter's just excited about\n  this \"Drop your Buffs thing.\" HUNTER:\nBut in reality, a few days ago, I found the Beware Advantage. It says you have to wait\n until either you lose or you drop your Buffs\nto get a clue to find a key to open a box to get the idol. Then I have to run back\n to the place where I found this Beware Advantage\nto begin with, dig it up and follow whatever\ninstructions it has for me before the new Tribemates\n show up. And so, this unknown timer just automatically\nstarts counting down. Okay. Okay. It's got\nto be some of the steps. Maybe the steps\nin front of camp. The thing that gave it away-- \"This step\nwon't lead you astray.\" And I almost immediately\n know where it is. Back at camp at the step. SODA:\nI can't even process this\nright now. A bunch of new people. HUNTER:\n So I go back to camp, and everyone is just sitting\n in the shelter, so, what am I supposed to do? SODA: You vibe. -HUNTER: Catch my breath.\n-SODA: You catch your breath. -You can do you.\nCatch your breath.\n-VENUS: Yeah. HUNTER:\n And so I'm like, \"Whatever. I'm gonna go sit on the steps.\" VENUS:\nWhat's his mindset right now? 'Cause I can't read him. -SODA: Who?\n-VENUS: Hunter. SODA:\nYou got to ask him.\nI don't know. I just asked.\nYou don't have to shut me out each time I ask you a question. SODA:\nThat's your feelings.\nThey're valid. I don't know. I know.\nI didn't say you did know. HUNTER:\nSo I'm digging in these stairs, but I can't find anything,\n and it's... It's pressure from all over. I've got people behind me probably gonna\ncome down the steps. I'm looking for a boat\n to come on the horizon. I mean, realistically,\nwe used to talk all the time in the beginning,\nand now you barely talk to me. And that's just a real...\nthat's, like... I'm not blind, so, like,\nthat's just reality. SODA: I feel like we have\nnot so much to talk about because Nami\nkeeps winning, and... But we need\nto talk to each other. Like, it doesn't have\nto be strategy all the time. HUNTER:\n If those boats show up, the time\nto find the idol is done. So, there is definitely\n a ticking time bomb. I don't just have\n to find this thing. I'm not looking for the idol. I'm looking for the key\nthat gets me to my box that opens it\nand then I get the idol. And so, there's so much to do\n and so little time and so many pressures,\n and you're just like, \"Oh, my goodness. I've got to get moving\nwith this.\" Oh, golly. Hey, Hunter. Come on, Liz. And so, I finally\n get the key out, and then here comes Liz, almost instantly, to talk to me. I think I left a sling\nout by the boat... 'cause I was excited. I'll go get it for you. I think I left my other one\nout there, too. I don't think\n she sees anything, and so, I hightail it to where\nI've hidden this thing. VENUS:\nOh! Dude, they're making\na beeline, bro. (whispering): Nice, nice, nice,\nnice, nice, nice, nice. Oh, my God. I finally open the box. There it is-- a full-blown idol\nsitting in this box for me to use that nobody... knows about. That was way too stressful. This is also\n really important because I lost my vote\n on the last journey. And so, in the end, this could be the only thing\nthat saves me. \u266a \u266a (whooping) The monster is coming. I look out into the water, then what do I see but two boats\n coming at me at full speed. I said... Here they come. (both whooping) LIZ:\nLand ho! Oh... my goodness. TEVIN: What I wanted to do was make people feel comfortable\nwhen they get here. Come on, y'all! Human to human, I see you.\n We all here. You got a dream, I got a dream. Hello, fellow human.\nLet's play the game. -Oh!\n-Hi, Charlie. -Nice to meet you.\n-Thank you.\nNice to meet you, too, man. Oh, it's so good to see you. KENZIE:\nWe're pulling up on Nami beach. I am just feeling\n so accomplished. There's five on Siga,\nfive on Nami, but there's three of us right in\nthe middle. Three of us Yanu. And ideally, it's just like,\n \"Which way are we gonna go?\" TIFFANY: Oh, my God. Yanu really got it handed to 'em in the beginning\n of this game, so, we've got some experience\n in our belt that the other tribes\n don't have. I know what it's like\nto see Jeff snuff a torch. Nami doesn't know that at all,\nand Siga's only done it once. So, I'm like\n a cast iron skillet that's been, like,\n oiled up and seasoned. And they're like store-bought,\nnonstick right now. Like, that's where we're at. -Hi, everybody.\n-(cheering) KENZIE:\n Giddyup, 'cause we're about\nto play, baby. (cheering) Wh en I w as t we lv e ye ar s ol d wi th c an ce r, I spent most of the year\nlooking out a hospital window. All I wanted was\nto be outside.

(indistinct, chatter) TIM: I just want to say\none thing to everybody out here. I don't know\nwhat's about to happen, but congratulations. (whooping, cheering) TIM:\nIt's hard. Just major congrats. TIM: We're excited, but we don't have any Buffs.\nThere's no merge. We're in this Survivor limbo. And so, we're kind of wondering what does happen next. TIM:\n But I know that\n my tribe is priority, so, we don't want\n any cracks evident. We want to seem like\n we're five strong because we don't want anybody\n to be exposed 'cause if we said that\nMoriah voted for Ben, they could think she's possibly\n on the outs of Siga, and probably use her\n as an alliance. And right now, we got\n to protect Siga's numbers. -VENUS: I mean, you know,\nsame thing as Siga.\n-Winning. When you keep winning,\nlike, no one's scrambling, no one's drawing lines. But I-I just want\nto work with you guys. It's a breath of fresh air\nto have new people on this camp. I am so excited to, like,\n have a new conversation and to not be met\nwith silence and blank stares from Tevin and Soda. Like, I am so over\njust their attitude towards me. Tevin is the type of person\nwhere if you were next to him\nin final three, I'm sorry, you're not winning. I have a good feeling\n that I can actually connect with new people and gain\n some more traction and, like, some more power in this game.\nI feel like I've had no power on Nami,\nI've had no say. Like, I've been on the bottom\nand King Tevin's been here, controlling all his puppets,\nand now I get to be the king. Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mmm,\nmm-mm-mm-mmm. Q: My take on the Nami group is there's cracks\nall around this island. They have a beautiful home, but\nthey ain't filled the cracks. And that is perfect because I've already kind of laid\n the foundation for the plus-one alliance. TIFFANY: Okay. TEVIN:\nAnd I said,\n\"That is a beautiful idea.\" I love it. I love it. -Beautiful idea.\n-Chef kiss. Q:\n Hunter, Tim and myself made an alliance at the journey, and we all got the opportunity\nto pull in one person who we all must protect. I pulled in Tiff. Hunter pulled in Tevin. Tim pulled in Maria. So today, the journey six is what I want to try\nto make sure is intact. -Yeah?\n-I'm more so... I'm just unsure about Tim because he has so many options\nover there, 'cause they do seem like\nthey're all getting along. Q:\n But Hunter and I--\n we still are a little wary about Tim and Maria on whether or not\nthey're on board. We have to make sure\nthat the six is solid. Yeah. Q: So, my next talk needs\n to be Maria because I wanted to figure out,\nhas Tim done his part? Did Tim talk to you\nafter the journey? Tim talked to me\nafter the journey. -Okay. Okay.\n-Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we-we kind of all do\neverything together. I don't know\nif you've heard that. -Yeah, he told us. Um...\n-We... We sit down and talk\nabout everything, and everyone knows\neverything, and... Now, Tim and I and Hunter--\nwe was talking, and Tim was telling us\nyou're his guy. -Oh, really?\n-Um, well, when I say \"guy,\" -like, that's the... that...\n-I'm his person? -Yeah, that's the person. -MARIA: Evidently, Tim told Q on their journey that\n Tim and I were really close. And I was like,\n\"Huh? Like, what about Ben? Like, I thought\nBen was your number one.\" Like, I thought\nit was very strange. You know,\n Charlie is my number one, and Tim and I have\n a connection, but by no means would I have\nput him top on my list. Like, he might have been\nnumber three. You know, everybody\nhas their person -in, like, different ways. -Q: Out of the gate, Maria didn't seem too filled in on the six, so I wanted to figure out\n what Tim actually told her from our journey. If Tim did not fill Maria in\n on the six, I know now\nTim is not to be trusted. And the other thing... Q: I-I didn't... TIM: No, I just think... She a connection type person,\nso anything, like... She gonna feel you out\neven if I tell her or not, you know, so I just like... I like that y'all\nwas already talking. I want to work\n with the group of six. I think they're strong, I think they have a good likelihood\n to go far in the merge. I've also seen\n people commit too early in past seasons\n of Survivor, so, I'm exploring, I'm observing. No solid game plans, but I'm not\n saying nothing too soon. I'll secure it before nightfall. I'll tell her the loop. Q:\n I'm so confused as to why\n Tim didn't tell Maria. Maybe he's trying to keep\n this Siga thing intact, but it got me worried now.\nIt got me worried.

VENUS:\n You know, it's a new stage\n in the game, and I'm so excited\n to start making big moves. It's been 12 days\n of just camping, and I didn't come here to camp. I came here\n to play the game, so, I need to see where Siga stands\nand where those cracks lie. TIM:\nYou know, everybody agrees\nto that before a merge. It's like,\n\"We're gonna be Siga...\" -TIM: Right.\n-Yeah, I mean, we're... We're entering, like,\na different st... -Yeah.\n-Numbers will give... VENUS:\n These tribal lines-- they're gonna have\n to dissolve. So, I said, \"I believe\nin a name for a name, and \"if you're willing\n to give me Siga, I'm willing to give you one\n of my Nami members.\" I feel like all of us might want\nto say something, but no one wants to talk first. Oh, I'm always gonna listen and watch the group before I can, like,\nmake a decision -on how I feel about anything.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. Like, I've been trying here\n'cause it's important, but, like, to be honest,\nit's overwhelming for me. Me too. Okay. We're, like,\nthe exact same person. They didn't really give me\n an answer, but Moriah-- I have a connection with her.\nI feel like I can trust her. I feel like she's a sweet girl, and I think\n she'll come around to it. So, now that I've planted seeds,\n I want to see what comes up. I have power in this game, too,\nand if you don't see that now, you will see it very soon.\n(chuckles) CHARLIE:\nThese rays are nice,\ncoming through the clouds. This is a trippy view. MORIAH:\n Clearly, the crack in Nami is Venus, and it sounds like there might be wiggle room\n to get a Nami out. But at the same time, Venus is clearly\na strong social player. She is aggressive\nwith her strategy, she is smart, she is thinking. So she's not someone\nI necessarily want to work with. She's crafty. -What about you?\n-Um, Venus approached Tim and me\nwith strategy talk. MORIAH:\nShe just said, \"Yeah, like, \"I'd be interested\nin a name for a name.\" Like, Tim and I tell her\nthe cracks on Siga and she tells us\n the cracks on Nami. Okay. Venus is playing\n a really hard game. Everyone can see that. She's wicked smart,\nas we say in Boston. She's got a good mind\n for the game, and she could be a threat to me. I did a quick check-in with Mo. Sounds like Venus was\nhitting you guys pretty hard. -TIM: Oh, yeah, yeah.\n -CHARLES: Yeah, yeah. -TIM: She came with it.\n -CHARLIE: Yeah. I'm not worried\nabout it, though. I'm not entertaining that 'cause Venus\nis giving it too hard. She said \"name for name.\"\nYou know what I'm saying? She... And you guys\ndidn't give one yet? No, I said, \"I get it.\nI totally understand. You know, I'll think about it.\" We're clearly\n playing the game now, but I'm not worried. I'm in a better position\n than I thought I'd be because I have both Siga and the, uh, plus-one alliance. But Q is asking Maria, \"Hey, have you talked to Tim?\" So, I got to talk to her\n one-on-one about the plus-one alliance. Yeah, yeah, yeah,\nlike, looking out... That's what Q put out first, and...\nHunter and I confirmed it. Like, yeah,\nthese are the people we trust. -Okay. Okay.\n-And we agreed that we'll look out\nfor each other's name. So at the end of the day, us six are potentially voting\nthe same way. I didn't tell Maria\n immediately because I wanted Maria\nto make her thoughts or her own feelings about the group of six. And at the end of the day, she agreed it was a strong six. I'm down for it.\nYou know, like... -You're down for it?\n-Yeah, I'm down... I don't want to put that on you\n'cause I know we didn't... No. Like, I was surprised 'cause\nyou and I didn't talk about it. -Yeah.\n-I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" -Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n-You know, like... If there's a group of six, I'm down for it because it's nice to have options. But the question is\n does it work for me? Because I'm not here\nto play Tim's game. I'm here to play my game. I'll take them anywhere.\nThe pool in the neighborhood. That's what I go for. I can eat\na whole bag of those things. Q: Listening\n to the Siga players now, it's really not much\nabout strategy or who they want to work with. They're playing a more cards-to-your-chest\n type of game. So, I want to make sure\n I get out there, have the right conversations so I can start to piece together\n the puzzle. I-I bet it was crazy when\ny'all got back on the beach. Everybody skedaddled. It really was. I mean, there's that moment of,\nlike, \"Do we open a coconut? Like, anyone hungry?\" -It was unanimous, huh?\n-Yeah. Other than my own tribe,\n no one knows that I'm potentially\n the crack in Siga because I was the one left out\n at the last Siga vote. But right now,\n the general consensus is that we need to stay united, so, I'm putting on this face that\nwe unanimously voted out Jem. Did she know\nshe was going home or... She didn't use\nher Shot in the Dark, so we just assumed,\nI guess not. Whose name did she write down? Um, she wrote down...\nI think she wrote down Ben. -That's crazy.\n-Yeah. MORIAH:\n Out of all the conversations\n I've had, I felt like Q is almost, like, hitting me the hardest. And that tells me\n he's looking for these cracks in a way that other people might not be, so, there's a little bit\nof trepidation there. Survivor is, like,\nso complicated. It's one of those, like... I don't think there's\na whiteboard big enough -in the world to, like,\ndraw everything.\n-Correct. Me? I started, like,\nwith Aubry. I think that she came out here and was just, like,\nauthentically herself. -That's it.\n-And, like, Aubry was really\nthe person that... It... (coughs) got me hooked. Like, she's my, like,\nOG, for like, watching, -like, the 30s and everything.\n-Yup. Mo seems like a nice person, but I'm scared of her. Where's everybody else?\nAt the beach? At the beach, but I was, like... -Is she?\n-Ooh. Yeah. Mo is just a Survivor fanatic that can talk, talk, talk\n this game. And for you to say Aubry\n is your favorite player-- that is dangerous,\n because Aubry was setting up people\nleft and right. And if Mo thinks\n she's gonna set me up, Mo can cancel Christmas. It ain't happening. Come on in. -CHARLIE: Oh, my...\n-PROBST: Look at this. You're gonna need\neverything you've got in the tank today. -(weak chuckle)\n-Oh...\n-SODA: Crazy. All right.\nShall we get to it? -(all voicing assent)\n-First things first. Got to take back the idols.\nThank you, Hunter. -TEVIN: Okay.\n-SODA: My God. -Thanks, Kenzie.\n-Yeah. No problem. -This is gonna be crazy.\n-(indistinct chatter) Tribal immunity... no more. -TEVIN: Wow.\n-Ooh.\n-Really? What? -Sorry.\n-Are you new? No. I'm sorry.\nI thought we were gonna split, and then it was gonna be...\nI-I know it's not a tribe. Okay, whatever.\nJust do your thing. -I'll do my thing.\n-Sorry. So right now,\nyou're in Survivor limbo. You don't have a Buff. Technically, you are not\npart of a tribe, but for at least six of you,\nthat's about to change. Let's get into it.\nFor today's challenge, we're gonna randomly divide\nyou into two groups of six. On my go, one at a time, you'll race under a muddy net to a cart. Once everybody's at the cart, you'll push that cart\n through the field, collecting very heavy sandbags\n along the way. You'll then use those sandbags to get you\n to the top of a tower. Once everybody's up top,\n you'll collect a bag of keys, slide down the other side. You're not finished. You will then work together\nto climb a massive boulder. When everyone's at the top,\n two players at a time will use one crate\n of puzzle pieces to solve one section of a three-section puzzle. So everybody's on the puzzle. -TEVIN: Mm-hmm.\n-MORIAH: Wow. PROBST:\nFirst group to finish earns their merge Buff,\na merge meal... (cheering) ...and immunity\nat tonight's Tribal Council. -Yes.\n-You'll go to Tribal. You will cast a vote, -but you can't be voted for.\n-Wow. Losing group,\nno Buff, no meal, no immunity. -Damn.\n-PROBST: Because there are 13, one person will not run. Whoever draws the gray rock\nwill choose one group and win or lose with them. -(whistles)\n-Big enough stakes? (all voicing assent) -Shall we draw for our groups?\n-(all voicing assent) Oh, my God. Good luck, guys, everyone. PROBST:\nAll right, here we go. Your fate is in your hands. Your entire game could change based on a rock draw. Does not rock. MORIAH: Does not rock. -PROBST: All right.\n-Mercy! All right,\neverybody palms out, flip 'em over and reveal. I' M AN DR EA , AN D TH IS I S WH Y I SW IT CH ED T O SH OP IF Y.

It's not profesh. All right, everybody palms out, flip 'em over and reveal. -(gasps)\n-If you have orange, go to Orange. If you have purple, go\nto Purple, and if you have gray, -go in the middle, Tiff.\n-Oh, no way. PROBST:\nLet's see what we got. No way! That's... (laughs) -No way!\n-PROBST: Wow. -Well, there you go.\n-I want to cry right now.\n-Oh, my God. PROBST:\nAll right, so, completely random draw. -You couldn't be more lopsided.\n-Wow. -It's tough for them, huh? Yeah?\n-Too much. -PROBST: Kenzie?\n-Yes. PROBST:\nWhat do you make of this? Because you are\non what would appear to be the better side\nof the draw. We don't know.\nWe haven't run it. Um, yeah, I think, uh,\nI'm gonna carry this whole team -on my shoulders.\n-Right. I got these boys ready\nto take it on, you know? Um, I haven't had very much luck,\nand I do think it's a game. Y'all have a fair shot. -Fair.\n-KENZIE: But I'm feeling\na little... a little good right now. All right,\nso let's go through our groups. For Orange, we have -Charlie.\n-Five, nine. -Moriah.\n-Five, four. -Soda.\n-Five, five. -Maria.\n-Five, two. -Venus.\n-Five, six. -And Liz...\n-Five even! taking on Ben, Q, Kenzie,\nHunter, Tim and Tevin. All right, Tiff,\nyou have a big decision to make. Which group are you gonna\nput your fate with? It's really tough, Jeff.\nI don't know. I think\nI'm gonna go with Purple. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: All right,\nso Tiff has chosen Purple. You will win or lose with them. You'll have a spot at the end. Everybody else, I'm gonna\ngive you a minute to strategize, and we'll get it on.\nLet's do this! (whooping, cheering) \u266a \u266a All right, here we go.

Start moving that cart! -Let's go, let's go, let's go.\n-Got to get a little momentum. -Pull back, pull back.\n-Pull back. PROBST:\nPurple struggling to get their cart moving. Oh! All right, now, stop when it\ngets over, I don't want to go too far,\nbut I want to keep momentum. PROBST:\nOrange back on the move,\nin the early lead. Let's go, Purple! VENUS:\nKeep going, keep going! There you go, more sandbags. Purple now on the move.\nThey've got all their sandbags. Make sure they're in the frame\nand you're building a stack. Build it as you go. -KENZIE: Guys...\n-TEVIN: Let's go. -Q: Y'all ready?\n-KENZIE: Got it? -HUNTER: Go.\n-PROBST: Purple has\nall their sandbags. -TIM: Get behind it.\n-PROBST: Orange now\nfalling behind. It is now Purple in the lead. They can move\nto that last section -where you use as many sandbags\n-Let's go. as you need to get to the top. Orange, you got to keep moving. Let's go. SODA:\nWe got this. PROBST:\nPurple doing a nice job. -Covered in mud.\nMakes it very slippery...\n-Push me up. -to help each other.\n-(grunts) PROBST:\nYou've got extra sandbags, as many as you need. You got to get everybody\nto the top before you can start\nuntying your keys. HUNTER:\nCome on. Come on, Tim. -(overlapping chatter)\n-Got it. PROBST:\nVenus is up quickly. -TIM: Come on.\nYou got it, Hunter?\n-(grunts) PROBST:\nThere goes Hunter.\nCharlie giving Maria a hand. They've got two up.\nYou're good, Purple. Once they're untied, one\nat a time, you can come down. MORIAH:\nI got you, Soda. -CHARLIE: Step up into my hand.\n-PROBST: Here goes Soda. VENUS:\nGo. You got this. You got this.

You got this, baby. Orange is still\nin this challenge. The underdog's got a shot here. CHARLIE:\nAnd lift and push. -Push.\n-I can't pull. -Push!\n-Push! -(whoops)\n-PROBST: Soda's up first. It's gonna be Tim and Tevin on\nthe first section of the puzzle. The bottom section,\nthe easier part of this puzzle. CHARLIE:\nGood work.\nNeed a boost? You got it? SODA:\nMoriah, take. Look at that. Moriah's up. -Soda pulls up Venus.\n-There you go. Go. PROBST:\nHere comes Charlie. This\nis where it gets really tricky. Soda tries to hold on.\nIt is hard when you're muddy. You're good. Go to section two. -BEN: Great job, guys.\n-Purple has first section done. It's gonna be Kenzie and Ben\nnow on the second section. Orange has a human ladder built. Everybody trying to help. -MORIAH: You did it!\n-PROBST: Charlie's up! TIM:\nTake all them out. Take all\nthem out. Sit 'em on the table. MORIAH:\nSoda... PROBST:\nOrange is in this. SODA:\nDo the first section. Go.\nYou're fast. Go. HUNTER:\nPut yellow on the left side\nand blue on the right. Come on. We got this. -SODA: Let's go, guys.\n-PROBST: It's gonna be Maria and Liz on the first section\nfor Orange. -They are in this.\n-TEVIN: Just lift that up... PROBST:\nDay 13. You never know. One of the most lopsided draws\nin Survivor history, but you wouldn't know it looking\nat this challenge right now. -Like this.\n-No. Flip it up. PROBST:\nBen and Kenzie gonna\nstart feeling that pressure. -Oh. I'm so sorry.\n-That's the other side.\nThat's the other side. PROBST:\nLiz and Maria\nfeel the opportunity. -Right. Yes. Yes.\n-SODA: Perfect! -VENUS: Yes.\n-PROBST: There's\nanother piece for Orange. -TIM: Bottom up.\n-Guys... PROBST:\nBen and Kenzie taking their\ntime. They've got a lead. -BEN: Blue.\n-No, that's gonna be white. PROBST:\nTrying to orient their pieces. Orange down to their last piece. -Got to get it in there\nand you're good.\n-Yeah, let's go. -Go.\n-You're good. Two new people. It's gonna be Soda and Moriah. Only two pieces behind.\nY'all, we got this. PROBST:\nThey're moving on\nto the second section. -TIM: Why don't we work\nfrom the top down?\n-It's Ben and Kenzie working together\nand feeling that pressure of Soda and Moriah\non their tail. It is Soda and Moriah on\nthe same section of the puzzle with Ben and Kenzie. Would anyone have predicted this moments before\nwe started this challenge? No. You can never predict what's\ngonna happen out here. -TIM: There you go.\n-TEVIN: Yeah. PROBST:\nThis section is difficult. That one up there's\nflipped over, too. -PROBST: But right now,\nwe look pretty even.\n-TEVIN: Yeah. That one in your hand.\nYes. Right there. PROBST:\nImmunity on the line. Ben with another piece\nfor Purple. -TIFFANY: Hell yeah.\nKeep that momentum.\n-TIM: Hold it there... -Q: That's it, Kenzie.\n-PROBST: Purple\npicking up the pace now. Down to just a few pieces\nleft in this second section. Orange is right on their tail. -LIZ: There you go.\n-PROBST: This is close. Stay calm, you guys. PROBST:\nTwo pieces left for Purple. -Okay, go, go, go, go.\n-Go! Jeff! -PROBST: You're good. Move on\nto that third and final crate.\n-Go! Go! Go! Third section of the puzzle. -We're just one piece behind.\n-LIZ: There you go, Mo. -PROBST: Orange is right behind.\n-CHARLIE: All right. You're good! Orange is good. Here comes Venus and Charlie... Y'all got to go\nfast, guys, fast. ...for the third and final\nsection of their puzzle. We're back on. That one. That one.\nThat one. Yes. Purple doing a nice job. -BEN: There you go...\n-PROBST: One piece at a time. Can Orange close the gap?\nIt's Charlie and Venus. All the pressure now on them. TIM:\nBring that triangle down. -You know where it goes.\n-PROBST: This is\na very close challenge. Charlie and Venus trying\nto catch and pass Hunter and Q. KENZIE:\nI know, I know.\nYou guys are doing so good. (overlapping chatter) -PROBST: Hunter\nwith another piece.\n-Let's go, guys. Yes, Charlie... PROBST:\nThere's another piece for Orange -and another piece for Purple.\n-TIM: There we go. PROBST:\nHunter is on a roll. Go, go, go. You got it. Orange is gonna have to kick it\ninto high gear right now. That one! That one! PROBST:\nIt's been a valiant effort,\nbut they are behind and Purple is close. SODA:\nDon't give up.\nYou got this, guys. BEN:\nRight there. Yeah. -PROBST: And another piece\nby Hunter.\n-(whoops) Comeback. SODA:\nYou got it. Okay. PROBST:\nPurple down\nto three pieces left. -Come on, dragon slayers.\n-(whoops) PROBST:\nThis is it, right here,\nfor the win. (Kenzie whoops) And they've got it. (cheering) Hunter, Q, Tim, Tevin... TEVIN:\nOh, my God! -...Kenzie and Ben.\n-(excited chatter) Safe tonight at Tribal Council. -(whoops)\n-PROBST: They earn\ntheir merge Buff. They'll enjoy a merge meal. -TIM: Good job, Orange.\nGood job, Orange.\n-BEN: Good job, Orange. -Good job, Orange.\n-Good job, Orange. Good job, y'all. That was tough. You were in it. That was tough. -I don't even care.\n-(laughing) All right, Purple,\ncongratulations. -You have made the merge.\n-Yay! -PROBST: Your merge Buffs\ninside.\n-Want to do it? KENZIE:\nWe can all do it. We all did it. PROBST:\nPut 'em on. Celebrate.\nYou earned it. Oh, my God! PROBST:\nBiggest challenge of the season. Shred red. -KENZIE: Yeah. (exclaims)\n-PROBST: All right, so here's\nwhat's gonna happen. You're all going\nback to camp together. The seven of you\nwill have a nice merge meal, separate from everyone else. Everybody goes\nto Tribal Council tonight. Everybody votes,\nbut nobody can vote for you. The only six people\nwho can be voted for are Moriah, Charlie,\nVenus, Liz, Soda and Maria. One of these six--\nyour journey will end 13 days into Survivor 46.\nGrab your stuff, head out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council. -Thank you.\n-Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you. PROBST:\nHead on down. Good job, guys. This was a clear\nDavid versus Goliath situation. And the Davids did really well,\n I feel like. But losing this challenge\n really hurt. I've been on Nami, and\nwe've been on a winning streak. This is my first Tribal. This is uncharted territory\n for me, which is why I might be,\n like, freaking out. I have agita. Agita, where you get,\nlike, chest pains, like a mini heart attack. I have agita. (laughs):\nThat's what I have right now. (whispering): Aw, this is where\nthe game gets really good.

VENUS:\n Just the fact that it wasn't\n this big blowout loss-- it just warmed my-my cold,\ndead heart, you know? I was like, \"Oh, my God. The underdog\ndoes have a chance.\" SODA:\nI'm gonna go\nwash off immediately. -CHARLIE: Yeah.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. I just can't\nstay like this anymore. CHARLIE:\nYeah, yeah, of course. There's a very clear\ntenseness in the air. I don't know\nif you guys looked over, but I was looking at Tiffany's\nface the whole time. She... MORIAH:\n The team that lost\n has three on Nami-- Venus, Soda and Liz-- and three on Siga--\n Maria, Charlie and myself. None of us have Buffs. We know that there are\nvotes coming to one of us. I need people to look and say, \"Mo ain't a risk.\" I can't have people saying, \"She's a strategist.\n She's gonna get us out.\" That just can't happen. (excited chatter) -To the merge!\n-Merge! -To the merge!\n-We did it. This is the making\nof an underdog story. This wine is just\nhitting, y'all. I'm trying to take it easy\nwith the wine, 'cause your girl ain't ate. KENZIE:\nI think this is a turning point\n for the Yanu tribe. Tiff, Q and I\n have been dealt enough of the bad hands in Survivor. We've gone 11 days\n without flint and food. We-we paid our dues. -With the grapes? This brownie?\n-With the grapes. With this whole bottle of wine. (laughing) Tiff, Q and I-- we're all safe. Siga and Nami\n are on the chopping block. So we're all just, like, deciding which way\nwe want to go. I think we're\nin a peculiar position, 'cause we got all of Yanu here. So y'all have an advantage. Siga and Nami\nare evenly numbered on the losing tribe. HUNTER:\nI can't even vote. -TIFFANY: Damn.\n-TEVIN: Ooh. Hunter can't vote, but, on day two, I took\na journey and got an extra vote. And at Tribal Council, there should be an extra vote\n sitting there, waiting for me. TIM:\nWe vote, right? -KENZIE: Yeah, we all vote.\n-TIFFANY: We vote. TEVIN:\n Siga and Nami are even,\n number-wise, and all Yanu's here, which means they're\nsafe tonight at Tribal Council. So it could be a Nami.\nIt could be a Siga. So, how you feel\nabout your tribe, Nami? All I will say\nis that from day one-- and I've been\nvery vocal about it-- is that I don't trust Venus. TIM:\nMoriah, Venus and I\ntalked at the water well, and Venus was\nthinking about opportunities. It completely validates\nwhy you may not trust her. I could see\nwhy that would be something you wouldn't want\nto work with going forward. Q: Y'all got\nto declare somebody, man. -Yeah.\n-Well, okay,\nso who's y'all's Siga person? BEN:\nI feel like it's hard.\nI know it sounds like I'm, like, playing a cover, but...\nreally, we just had that Tribal. I don't want to throw\n anybody's name out from Siga. I really want\n to go Siga strong. But everybody keeps asking,\n\"Yo, what's up with Siga? You guys got\n to throw a name out there.\" -So we got out of that Tribal...\n-HUNTER: Who was that? -Jem.\n-TIM: Jem. -Jem's gone.\n-BEN: Yeah. TIFFANY:\n Siga's kind of beating\n around the bush a little bit. They don't really want\n to throw out a name. They're not really trying\n to work with us, despite the fact that that's the impression\nthey're trying to give off. If you were, then you\n wouldn't be so tight-lipped about who on your tribe\nyou were willing to put on the chopping block. Q:\nSiga got to declare somebody. KENZIE: Who's a threat? TEVIN:\nI was about-- I've heard through\nthe grapevine that she's savvy. TIFFANY:\nI've heard her, like,\nspit some crazy Survivor facts. If she know this game like that,\nthat scare me, dawg. Do you think that Venus or Mo\nis more manipulative? TIFFANY:\nIn my personal opinion,\nI would be more intimidated by somebody who's\nmore knowledgeable than somebody who's just being shiesty, because shiesty\nyou can sniff out a mile away. Somebody who's smart\ncould outmaneuver you in a lot of different ways. While they're quickly\n trying to get Venus out, they're basically just showing\n their hand and saying that they're trying\nto stay Siga strong. TIM:\nI'm not saying Mo's off-limits. I want Venus now.\nYou have Mo. Let's vote. TIFFANY:\n Because they were\n so willing to vote Venus and more reluctant to say Mo,\nit made me want to vote Mo.

Angry faces.\nNo, don't clap for these people. TIM: Everybody agrees\n that Venus is a snake and some people agree\nthat Mo is a threat. CHARLIE:\nHello. -VENUS: Hello. Wow.\n-Hey. Yay. TIM:\n At the feast, they said,\n \"We want you to vote for Mo.\" Why would I vote\nfor somebody on my tribe? We want to hear about the feast. BEN:\nCome on, don't make us\nfeel guilty, dude. -MORIAH: I really want to know.\n-CHARLIE: No, tell me. TIM:\n Yes, I threw\n Mo's name out there, but I'm trying\n to swing things towards Venus. I am protecting Mo and really protecting\nSiga's numbers. -Any talk over there?\n-So... Yeah, definitely talks. What's the deal? Everybody had to throw a name. -Okay.\n-Nami, it seems like there's\nsome distrust with Venus. Okay. -For Siga's name...\n-Yeah. -I said Mo.\n-Okay. And if I was\ngonna give 'em a name... -Yeah.\n-(scoffs) I'm not\ngiving 'em Charlie's name. Okay. What I'm hearing\n is Venus and Mo. And I don't want Mo to go, but this is\nan incredibly important vote. -Yanu's gonna vote Mo,\nbut I'm voting Venus.\n-So... I'm not gonna\ngo down in numbers first. Um, Mo's gonna get\na little antsy from that. She is. So with that, we have\nto tell her to vote Venus. If it's five of us,\nwe keep our five. CHARLIE:\n The question is,\n how hard do we push to save Mo at this point? This is the individual part\n of the game. I have to get through this vote. And if Mo going home\nis what it takes for me to stay, that's what\nhas to happen tonight. Right. HUNTER:\n I want to guide this vote,\n even if I can't vote. You need more big sticks? HUNTER:\n Ultimately, I want\n to take out Moriah because Siga is so strong. If we leave Siga in this, it's gonna get tough later. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. Okay? Q:\n Siga is a stronger tribe, right now, than Nami. -SODA: How many hours do\nyou think we have before Tribal?\n-Like, three. Q:\n Siga-- they're trying\n to keep it together. Nami has cracks. So it might be wiser\n for us to side with Nami and vote out Mo. I want your opinion, though. Who do you think\nis the right call? Should we do Siga, Nami? I needed just\nan honest vibe on... LIZ:\nWe were like, \"Where's Tiff?\" I was hoping that you weren't\ndown on the beach. Uh, you got to vote Mo tonight,\nif you want to stay. VENUS: \"It's Mo.\n And if you don't vote Mo, it's you.\" That really pissed me off. TIFFANY:\nThis is what happened.\nThe name from your camp was you. We were waiting a while\nfor Siga to throw a name out, and they wouldn't.\nWe need to... -It needs to be a Siga today.\n-VENUS: I agree with Siga. I'm unsure about Mo. Let's give it a beat.\nLet me talk a little bit more. But for now, we know Siga. TIFFANY:\nBut I'm just telling y'all, do not say anything, because... -Oh, I'm not gonna\nbreathe a word.\n-TIFFANY: Y'all might... VENUS:\n When someone hears their name,\n it's easy to, like, go into panic mode.\nLike, \"Oh, my God.\" Like, \"Anything but me.\" But I realized, in that moment, this is a stupid vote. Charlie would be a smarter vote. A man needs to go next. Charlie is the only man\n that we can vote out tonight, so I want Charlie gone. Did they say anything else\nabout Mo? -Specifically? The guys?\n-KENZIE: No. VENUS:\nI need to understand why Mo. If it's 'cause\nshe's a superfan alone, you should be scared\nfor the next vote. That's why\nwe should think Charlie. Have you picked that up\nfrom Siga's dynamics? -Yeah, but the boys\nare super close, extremely.\n-Like, why... That's why I was saying Charlie\nshould be the name, not Mo. It'd be stupid of us\nto vote out a girl because the three boys say... Look, all the ... men\nwent on a feast. (inhales sharply) You're not wrong about that. KENZIE:\n Venus is pissed. She's mad\n that Mo's name is out there. Venus doesn't want to send a girl home,\nand so Venus throws out Charlie. This is where\n the plan gets rocky, because if Venus\n would just vote Mo, Mo just goes. Easy. Venus doesn't want Mo. -I know what\nVenus has got going on.\n-And, see, what scares me is... (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. Mad. Not just like... Q:\nI just told Venus\nthat it's either her or Mo. So if she mad about it,\nI'll vote Venus. I'm going Venus. I can't... The girls right now in this game\n have seven to six on the men. Venus don't want\nto vote a woman. That's why she was throwing out Charlie's name\nat the water well. But I have to make sure Venus understands\nI put my game on the line and told you\nexactly what is gonna happen. If you gonna be ungrateful... I'll send your ass\nback to Canada. -KENZIE: So what are you gonna tell Venus-- Mo? I ain't talking\nabout Venus no more. -Okay.\n-Damn, Venus. TEVIN:\n I'm okay to send Venus home because I have not\ntrusted Venus since day one. She's been running around\nthis island alone. I don't know\nif she has a Beware Advantage. She's been spinning narratives on me.\n And all of those things line up in a way\n that make me feel like I can't trust Venus at all, and therefore she must go. Tevin will go... And then all of us go... Okay. I am so worried. I-I know my name\nhas been out there. It is annoying\nto hear your name go down, -Mm-hmm.\n-but there's more votes on Venus. MORIAH:\n Going into the merge,\n I decided to work with Siga. I fear that I am putting my loyalty and my trust\nin the wrong spot. So I feel like I have\n a lot of work to do today to make sure\nI'm not going home tonight. TIFFANY:\nWe got to get on the same page. Where is Q at? TEVIN:\nThere he go. Yes. Come here. -TIFFANY: Yes, please.\n-TEVIN: Come here, please. -It's got to be quick.\n-TIFFANY: What the ...\nis going on? -I don't know what the...\n-HUNTER: Why'd you change it? -Just stick with Mo.\n-Venus is moving around, saying all kinds of ... -What'd she say?\n-HUNTER: Venus gonna\nget herself voted out. TEVIN:\nHe also doesn't like\nthat Venus is playing a game that we don't want\nto vote out none of the women. She says she don't want\nto vote no women out. HUNTER:\nWho's she gonna vote out? Then why\nare we worried about it? Things are kind of chaotic\nright now because whoever goes home tonight, Mo or Venus is\ngonna be the determining factor of the trajectory\n of the next couple of votes. On paper, Yanu has a really large say\n in tonight's vote, but based\n on how conversations go, that could quickly change. All I know is that\n I'm glad I'm safe tonight because, baby,\nit's about to get messy. (V O) At D og C ho w we believe helping dogs live\ntheir best life... should be simple.

This is part\nof the ritual at Tribal Council because in this game,\nfire represents your life. When your fire's gone,\nso are you. All right. A lot going on.\n13 people here. Seven are safe, six are not. Tevin, the juxtaposition\nof having more than half the group completely safe is very unusual\nat Tribal Council. The perfect word that you\njust used is \"juxtaposition,\" because though I am protected, I still have to be very aware\nof what is happening at this Tribal Council,\nbecause this will add up to what will happen when I'm inevitably\nmaybe not safe at the next one. PROBST:\nQ, what is it like having seven people that are safe? So, for me, Jeff, I'm just happy\nthat I'm one of the seven that has this so far,\nbecause going back to camp after that feast was like\nmy little brother kicking over an ant pile and the ants\njust started running at me. -(laughing)\n-It was like,\n\"You had time to eat, buddy. Now, it's time to talk.\" And we'll see where\nthings kind of shake up. PROBST:\nSo, Charlie, as one of the six, can you try to move the game\nin a direction you want? Being part of the six, I feel\nlike I'm a goalkeeper, you know? I have a goal,\nand I'm not taking any shots. All I'm doing is blocking,\nyou know? I'm just listening. If I hear the name Charlie,\nI got to get to work. How about for you, Venus?\nCan you still play offensively even though you're trying\nto make sure it's not you? Oh, 100%, Jeff.\nYou never give up. None of us want our names\nwritten down, but, also, like, if the kings of the castle\nover there, who already have their Buffs,\nsay a name, you have to listen out\nfor whether or not your name's being said and to\nmove that target off your back. So, Hunter, how is it decided\nwho you're gonna vote for? HUNTER:\nYeah, I don't have a say in this\nvote, and so I'll break the ice. The Yanu has\nthe choice right now, and they have to choose\nwho's gonna lose a number: Siga or Nami.\nAnd right now Siga is really, really close. Like, the cloud nine of vibes. And, Moriah,\nthat's what Hunter should do-- throw it on another tribe,\nnot his. Yeah, I mean,\nI'd be lying if I said we weren't doing the same, but I'll let you all\nin a little secret here. It was not unanimous\nat the last Tribal Council. I was the odd out. I didn't get the vote right. I am on the damn bottom,\nand I do not fit in. HUNTER:\nBut perception\nis just reality, though. Like, none of us knew that -because y'all\ndid such a good job.\n-Yeah. And so\nif that was the case, like, -you have to help us\nwith our perceptions.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. Yeah, and I'm-I'm helping\nyou along as I can. I mean... Well, you're talking\nto the guy who can't vote. -Yeah.\n-(laughing) I think I'm talking\npretty loudly to the guy that can't vote. -(laughs)\n-But the question\nreally is up to Yanu. Q, in a game all about numbers, Moriah just said,\n\"I'm not a part of that group.\" Is that appealing? It's appealing, Jeff,\nif I feel like the information is accurate, because this\nis the first time I'm personally hearing that\nshe was on the bottom. Q, I'm serving it up to you\non a silver platter here. -But I'm a man of truth.\n-Yeah? Q:\nAnd in one conversation that we had,\nI asked a simple question. MORIAH:\nYeah. Q:\nWhat went on at Tribal for Siga? That probably\nwould have been a time to say, \"I am on the bottom.\nI need help.\" But instead, I was told\nthat the vote was unanimous. So, Moriah,\nare you playing for Siga or are you playing for you? I'm playing for me.\nI want that merge Buff. If you were on the bottom,\nwhy not express that? -You see what I'm saying?\n-Yeah. Don't let anyone\nmute you in this game if you feel like\nyou're on the bottom. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n-Q: That's valuable information. -MORIAH: Okay.\n-Yeah. Yeah. PROBST:\nTim, weigh in on this, because a lot\nof information is coming out and it is a showdown\nbetween two tribes, with the Yanu three\nin the middle. Yeah, I mean, they were kind of\nforced to make a decision on choosing someone from Nami\nor choosing someone from Siga. And so at the feast,\nwe went around the table and everybody\nthat had a vote said a name. And at the feast, we left\nwith a clear understanding of who might be voting for who\nat tonight's Tribal Council. Charlie, did you hear your name? I heard whispers,\nbut my way of dealing with the whispers is to go\nto the people that I trust, that I've connected with,\nthat I've spoken with, and saying, \"Do I need\nto go scramble like crazy or was this just a whisper?\" Venus, did you hear your name? Oh, yeah. A lot. Plenty of times.\nA terrifying amount of times. But you can't\nlet that get to you. I mean, realistically,\nI hope the people around me are smart enough to see\nthe value I could bring to them, and if they're as smart of\na player that I think they are, they'll probably want to keep me\naround over someone else. So, Moriah, how are you feeling? You pitched a case.\nPeople seem to be hearing it. Are you feeling\noptimistic or pessimistic? I know what\nI wanted to say today. I'll tell you right now, I might\nbe the most honest person at this Tribal Council.\nAnd, you know, there's important information\nout here. I know how whispers fly\nand how whispers go, and I wanted\nto say it loud and clear for all of you\nto hear what happened. And I'm feeling very satisfied with my message. All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. Let's do it. \u266a \u266a (mutters) \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. \u266a \u266a MORIAH:\nJeff. \u266a \u266a -Thank you.\n-Mm-hmm. \u266a \u266a All right, Moriah\nplayed her Shot in the Dark, which means there\nis no vote in here from Moriah. Moriah, if this scroll\nsays you're safe, any votes cast against you\nwill not count. If it says you're not safe, all votes cast against you\nwill count. Moriah, you are... ...not safe. Any votes cast against you\nwill count. I'll read the votes. \u266a \u266a First vote: Venus. Moriah. Moriah. Two votes Moriah,\none vote Venus. Moriah. That's three votes\nMoriah, one vote Venus. Moriah.\nThat's four votes Moriah. Moriah.\nThat's five votes Moriah. Sixth person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Moriah.\nThat's six. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. Moriah, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Bye, Moriah.\n-Moriah. Moriah. -Mo-chete.\n-Mo-chete. Congratulations.\nYou are officially merged. -(whoops)\n-Yay!\n-(cheering) (whoops) -Santa Claus.\n-(laughs) (whooping) All right, grab your torches. Head back to camp.\nGood night.

        "transcript":"(whooping and cheering) (chanting): Merge! Merge! Merge!\nMerge! Merge! Merge! PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... There it is-- a full-blown idol that nobody... knows about. Q:\n For the plus-one alliance,\n I pulled in Tiff, Hunter pulled in Tevin,\n Tim pulled in Maria. So the journey six is what I want to try\n to make sure is intact. KENZIE:\n Right now, as it stands, there's five on Siga,\n five on Nami. But there's three of us\nright in the middle. Three of us Yanu. Soda hates Venus.\nIt's a mess. Q:\n Nami has cracks,\n so it might be wiser for us to side with Nami and vote out Mo. I'm unsure about Mo. TIFFANY:\n Oh, my God.\n All I know is that I'm glad I'm safe tonight\n because, baby, it's about to get messy. First vote: Venus. Sixth person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Moriah.\nThat's six. That's enough. The tribe has spoken. Congrats on the first Tribal\nfor some of y'all. -Wasn't that intense?\nThat was...\n-It was bad. -That was really intense.\n-BEN: Whoa. That was really, like, bad. VENUS:\n My first Tribal was mind-blowing. Seeing my name written down\non a piece of parchment as the very first vote--\nit was just terrible. But the fact that there was just\n only one vote with my name and the rest was straight Mo-- I automatically knew that Soda\n wrote my name down because that's the only thing\nthat could possibly make sense. Oh... Sure. Our relationship has been\na question mark for a while now. I really wish\nI could have worked with her, but I'm also not stupid. I know that I'm loyal, but the way that you were being\nevasive with your answers... That's why I... that's why I came to you the way\nthat I did, because it's alarming to me that you,\nlike, went straight for me in the attitude\nthat you did, though. I'll be straight up with you. I needed a moment\n'cause I know I snapped. No, that's fine\nthat you needed a moment, but you did snap\nat the same time. Like, it is fine\nthat you needed a moment. I didn't want to raise my voice. No, but you still were, like,\n\"You voted for me.\" TEVIN: Watching Soda and Venus is kind of the hottest tea\nof the night. I told Soda I don't trust Venus,\nI don't trust where she stands, I don't trust her loyalty, and I think that she'll flip\n any second that she gets. Soda hasn't listened to me,\n and now they are digging\ntheir own graves and showing the people how toxic and dangerous they are\nto the game. And I hope that they continue\n to do that because it will slide them closer to\nthat snuffer and keep me closer to that million dollars. CHARLIE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you want to chat one-on-one,\nor, like, I can explain now. -VENUS: We can talk\nin the morning.\n-CHARLIE: Okay. Yeah. Q:\n Charlie put a vote\n on Venus anonymously. So, for Venus to come back\nand to now think that Soda wrote her name down was gonna be the perfect plan. I need Nami to be in panic mode. But Charlie lets his emotions\n get the best of him, and he confesses to Venus that he is the one that wrote her name down. In this game, we cannot have that going on. And I think he needed to be put in his place. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, man.\nYou are right. I messed up here.\nI messed up here. -I'm with you.\n-You know what I told you? -Yeah.\n-Do not let your emotions -get you in this game.\n-Yeah. You don't have to admit ...\nto nobody. You're right. You're right. Q's real mad at me for telling Venus\nthat I voted for her. And in this moment,\n I'm just saying, \"I'm sorry,\" and just letting him know\n that we're solid. But what I'm thinking is, Q is running this show, and no one is allowed\n to have any other ideas. \"We're doing this,\n we're locking it down, \"we're getting to the end, we're doing it Q's way\n or it's the highway.\" So... I need to get Q\nout of the game. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a (Ben gasps) (panting rapidly) (gasps) -Ben, is that you?\n-Yeah. I'm right here. I'm right here. It's not bad.\nIt's not, like, hurting. BEN: After Tribal, I wake up from a dream, and panic mode, like, kicked in. I have this hysteria\n for about 50 seconds, and I have to calm down\n for a minute. LIZ: Yeah. BEN:\n I understood how nuts it was\n in the moment, 'cause I've had\n panic attacks before. It's, like, something\n I can't control. Thank God there were\nsome nice people in the tribe, and Kenzie was able\n to just calm me down. KENZIE:\n My mom and sister\n both struggle with anxiety. They struggle\n with their mental health. So, I've been helping people\n regulate sleep and anxiety before I even knew\n what that was, really. KENZIE:\n You know, this is a game where I very easily could have\nbeen like, \"Good, don't sleep. I hope you mess up\nin the challenges.\" But that...\nI couldn't. I couldn't. BEN:\n Kenzie held my hand,\n helped me make a fire, and she made me feel like\n it wasn't gonna be some kind of, like,\n\"Yo, Ben's being a freak show,\" back to, like,\nthe sixth grade vibe. KENZIE:\n I don't care if it's a game\n for a million dollars. Like, at the end of the day,\n Ben's a person. Is he my competition? Yes.\nBut he's my friend. And sometimes you just got\n to be there for somebody and just sit with them\n through it. Just be with them\n through the storm, you know? Sometimes that's\nall someone needs. \u266a \u266a Bring in the boats. (whooping) PROBST:\nCome on. -Morning, Jeff.\n-Good morning. Boy, it feels good\nto make the merge. -(whooping)\n-Good morning, Jeff. (whooping) Wow. Come on up. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -(all voicing assent)\n-(whooping) PROBST:\n For today's challenge, you're gonna balance\n on a triangular platform with your feet perched\n on very narrow footholds. At regular intervals,\n you're gonna move higher up on the platform,\n making it more difficult. If at any point\n you touch the platform, or fall off of the platform,\n you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity,\nsafe from the vote. If you are wearing this... -(whooping, exclaiming)\n-Whoa. I love it. PROBST:\n...it means you are not going home. There is a twist -to today's challenge.\n-Uh-oh.\n-Oh, wow. You're gonna be randomly divided into two groups of six, which means two people\nwill have individual immunity -at tonight's Tribal Council.\n-(whooping, cheering) Two people will be safe. The bad news is both groups -are going to Tribal Council.\n-SODA: Ooh. So, two people\nare going home tonight. -Oh.\n-Oh.\n-Oh. In addition,\nyou're playing for reward. -Want to know\nwhat you're playing for?\n-(all voice assent) The person who lasts the longest\nfor the entire challenge earns for their entire group coffee and tea, hot and cold, sandwiches-- veggie and tuna, meat pies,\ncream cheese Danishes... -Lord Jesus.\n-waiting for you back at camp. In addition, that group will go\nto Tribal Council second. And that matters, because the group that goes first, the person voted out will not make the jury. -Big enough stakes?\n-Oh, my God. PROBST:\nAll right, we're gonna\ndraw for groups. LIZ:\nYeah. Ooh. My heart. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a Marathon, nice to meet you.

Everybody take\nyour first position. In Purple: Soda, Liz, Maria, Charlie, Venus and Tevin. In the other group\nwe have Tiff, Kenzie, Hunter, Ben, Q and Tim. You will be competing\nagainst each other, and whoever stays up there the longest overall earns, for their group, food. And you go\nto Tribal Council second. Everybody's up? Everybody's good. This challenge is on. Cowabunga. PROBST:\nWe'll be here for 15 minutes. Last time we did this challenge, very different conditions. Maryanne is out. Rocksroy's out. Omar's out. Mike's out. It is a very rough day\non the water. The entire challenge lasted,\nlike, three minutes. Today, it's like a lake. -KENZIE: Okay.\n-TIFFANY: Yeah. With, like, cities\nor food or something? -Yup.\n-Yes. Somebody start it. -A for Atlanta.\n-Q: Atlanta. Who's next? -B for Birmingham.\n-You have to say, \"Atlanta,\" then whatever. A, Atlanta. B for Baltimore. Oh, my goodness.\nYou're out, Ben. -(laughs)\n-BEN: Let's go, Liz. C for Cincinnati. Well, you got to say...\nWait. What? -But Ben said two Bs already.\n-Q: B is out. -Q's making up the rules here.\n-So you say, \"A for Atlanta.\" -Atlanta.\n-LIZ: Oh, I got\nto start all over? -Yes.\n-Yes.\n-C for Cincinnati. -Oh, my God!\n-(laughs)\n-CHARLIE: Wait, wait. -I'll go, I'll go.\n-Q: There we go. -There we go, Charlie.\n-All right, all right. -I got this. You ready?\n-Go. Baltimore. -Oh, my God.\n-(blows raspberry) HUNTER:\nCharlie knows. -(laughs)\n-Q: New game. -Who's next?\n-PROBST: I'd just like to take a moment and say,\nin honor of Jelinsky, you've been up here\nseveral minutes. -Several!\n-Yay!\n-PROBST: Which means seven. -Legend.\n-PROBST: Everybody looking\nreally good. 14 days into Survivor 46, balancing\non a triangular platform, trying to stay\nin a million-dollar game. 15 seconds left in this round. Uh-oh. PROBST:\nAlmost there. Hang in there. Five, four, three, two, one.\nEverybody's safe. -You can touch your platform.\n-(whooping) You're gonna\nbe moving quickly, though, so, don't get too comfortable. You have 15 seconds to get up on that top shelf. Start making your move. Ten seconds left. This is a live transition,\nwhich means, if you fall, you're out. Five, four, three, two, one.\nQ can't make the transition. Soda can't make the transition. We have\nour first two casualties. One person from Purple is out. One person from Orange is out. Wobbly. Damn it! Ben is out for Orange. Orange is down to four. This challenge\nis picking up now. It is Charlie, Maria, Tevin, Venus and Liz\nfor Purple. For Orange, it is Hunter, Tim, Kenzie and Tiff. We'll be here for 30 minutes. Ooh. Mm. PROBST:\nYou want to survive\ntonight's Tribal, you've got to outlast\nthe other people you're competing against. You want reward,\nyou got to outlast everybody. What's up, Jeff? What's up, Tim? Thanks for the shout-out. Nah, Jeff, that's how Black people ask you,\nlike, what the time is. -(laughs) Yes.\n-Ah. I learn a lot on this show. So rare\nto have a moment like this. You against you. How long can you last? What's up, Jeff? You are 23 minutes in -to this section.\n-(laughs)\n-(whistling) Once again, -very calm waters of Fiji.\n-(sighs) There's not even a sound. (whispering):\nAbsolute quiet. Now y'all want to be quiet. HUNTER:\nOh, you can't? My daddy told me when I'm not\nin a fight, shut my mouth. -Oh.\n-SODA: Mm.\n-TEVIN: Mm-hmm. PROBST (regular volume):\nDon't let the silence lull you into sleep. Think of something to distract. TIM:\nShout out Jalen, shout out my sons-- Carter, Cooper. Shout out my wife Jasmine. Shout out Tevin mama\nfrom Virginia. -Hortensa. Yay, yay.\n-Shout out Charlie's daddy Brian.\nShout out Maria's family-- Sebastian, Leo, Juju. That's what Black people do\non the radio, Jeff. -TIM: ...Spicer, family.\n-\"Shout out to Uncle PooPoo -and my nephew John.\"\n-TIM: Your daddy said, \"If you ain't in a fight,\nshut up.\" -You right.\n-(Probst laughs) Most fun I've had\nat challenge in a long time. (laughs) PROBST:\nOne minute left in this round. Here's where we stand.\nIn Purple, whoever lasts the longest out of the five of you\nwill earn immunity. In Orange, whoever lasts\nthe longest of you four will earn immunity, and whoever stays up there the longest earns, for their group, food. You will also go\nto Tribal Council second. That means two people will be gone from the game. One will not even make the jury. This section is over. The last part\nof this challenge is -you're gonna lift one foot.\n-Ooh. Wow. PROBST:\nI'm gonna count you in\nin ten seconds. When I get to one,\nyou've got to lift that foot. You don't have to lift it\nbefore then. You're on your own if you do. You can use those ten seconds\nhowever you want. Here we go. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Charlie's out.\nTim's struggling. Tim is out.\nWe're down to three on Orange. It's Hunter, Kenzie and Tim. Venus is out. Liz is out. Hunter's out.\nWe're down to two on Orange and two on Purple. Tiff is out. -Kenzie wins immunity,\n-Yes! but she's out. Kenzie has won immunity. Now it's a showdown\nbetween Tevin and Maria. Yes. We want food, but stay in, Tev. Stay in. PROBST:\nPurple has already earned\nthe reward. Now the question is\nwho will have the immunity. Both players\nlooking really solid. PROBST:\nMaria, rock solid. Very little movement. Tevin, a lot of movement. Both players still up there. -SODA: Hey, you got this.\n-PROBST: Tevin\ntrying to recover. -CHARLIE: Oh, nice.\n-PROBST: And he does! -An amazing recovery!\n-SODA: Wow, Tevin! -PROBST: Wow.\n-SODA: Good job, Tevin! PROBST:\nKeep fighting. You got\nnothing else to do right now. Just this. You want that necklace. Tevin once again\ntrying to recover. SODA:\nYou got this, Tevy baby. PROBST:\nKevin drops. He's out. -Maria wins individual immunity\n-(cheering) and reward for her crew. Epic challenge. SODA:\nYes. Maria! Maria! VENUS and SODA:\nMaria! Maria! -Maria!\n-PROBST: Maria, before you get in the water,\nwhat's the emotion right now? You know, Jeff, I just... I kept thinking about,\n\"Just think about yourself. \"Think about yourself. You've\ndone harder things in life. \"Don't think about anybody else. \"I've felt so much more pain\nthan this. Just-just forget about it.\" SODA:\nThank you, Maria. -(whoops)\n-SODA: Good job, Tevin! Good job, guys. Kenzie, you pulled it out. Good job, Kenz. -(squeals)\n-Congratulations. Thank you so much. Individual immunity is yours. You are not going home tonight. With this around your neck,\nyou are safe. -Head back.\n-Thank you. -Maria, come on over.\n-TEVIN: Go get it, Maria. (whooping) The only thing missing\nis a hug from you. -Oh, well, I...\nwe can get a hug.\n-Oh, my hug. Yes. Thank you. -TEVIN: Get it, Maria.\n-PROBST: Congratulations, Maria. Safe tonight at the vote.\nIn addition, you've won a big reward for your group. -Head back.\n-BEN: Lieutenant Mom! (whoops) -Thank you, Maria.\n-Good job, Maria. PROBST:\nAll right,\nso here's what's gonna happen. Liz, Soda, Venus,\nTevin, Maria, Charlie, you will go\nto Tribal Council second. Swim out.\nEnjoy the afternoon. I'll see you\nat Tribal Council tonight. SODA:\nFelt slow. All right,\nso, Kenzie, you're safe tonight. -Yep.\n-The six of you will go\nto Tribal Council first, where, sadly,\nthe person voted out will not make the jury. One last thing. You're not going back to camp. You're going back\nto the old Siga camp. All right, swim out. See you\ntonight at Tribal Council. All right, see you later, Jeff. HUNTER:\n Nobody wants to be the person\n that's chopped off right before\n they make it to the jury, and I am the odd man out. So I need to play my idol\n to get me to that jury, to get another day, to get back\nto Tevin and to the Nami people. And if that's what it takes\n to get there, then that's what I'll do. There is simply\nnothing like Survivor. It tests you on so many levels and offers you nowhere to hide. If that sounds like fun,\napply to be on Survivor. I wa s bo rn w it h a fi re i ns id e. But psoriasis doused my flame. Until I got clearer skin\nwith BIMZELX. Most people got\n100% clear skin. Some after the first dose. (\u266a\u266a) Serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts\n and behavior, infections and lowered ability\n to fight them, liver problems, and inflammatory bowel\n disease, have occurred. Tell your doctor\n if these happen or worsen, or if you've had\n a vaccine or plan to. Start to get yourself back,\nwith BIMZELX. Ask your dermatologist\n about BIMZELX today. I he ar t ha t mu si c an d my f ee t ju st s ta rt t ap pi ng . My grandchildren, they're\n sixth generation of dancers. It's what my family\n is all about. I thought I knew a lot\n about our Irish roots. I was surprised to learn so many more things\n from Ancestry. 1892. Oh and here's the boat\nthey came over on. There was a Julie Healy,\na Mary Healy, this is all their names? Yes, yes. Wow. \u266a \u266a -SODA: Oh, my God. Yay,\n-TEVIN: Lord, -have mercy.\n-you guys, first feast! TEVIN: Oh!\n-SODA: See, this is why\nI wasn't worried. (indistinct chatter) CHARLIE:\nMaria and Tevin. Our angels. MARIA:\n The immunity challenge was a dream come true. Not only did I win immunity.\n I won reward for our group, which\nmeant we finally got to eat. -Cheers. To Maria and Tevin.\n-Cheers. -SODA: To the merge feast,\nthanks to Maria and Tevin.\n-Yes. Yes. (overlapping chatter) CHARLIE:\nOh, man, this is so good. SODA:\nThis coffee is so good. Wow. VENUS:\n Winning this means everything. Maria, my girl-- she really\n pulled it out for us, and she basically gave us\na second life in this game. Like, we were given a feast that is gonna energize\n us for future challenges. But even more than that,\n she basically guaranteed that we're all at least\n gonna make the jury, which is huge, you know, and, you know, coming in,\nit seems obvious. You know, there's four Nami,\n there's two Siga-- Charlie and Maria. And Maria has\n the immunity necklace. Who's the obvious vote? Charlie, my guy who put my name down\nthe last vote is unfortunately up on the chopping block. Oh, my God. TEVIN:\nCan we cheers? We are all\nat least on the jury. We will be... (cheering) TEVIN:\n From the outside looking in, you would automatically think,\n \"Oh, there's four Nami, there's two Siga, Maria's safe.\" So, I think\nthat people would assume that Charlie would be\nthe one going home because he's not in the numbers. However,\n Maria and I know different. We understand\n that there is another game being played\n that is across tribal lines. So we see that it's not\nNami versus Siga here. And so, tonight is the night\nthat I want to make a big move. I want to be the curator of the\nfirst blindside of the season. Poor Hunter is all alone\nover there. MARIA:\nThat's gonna be, like,\nmassive strategy -over there right now.\n-Yeah. \u266a \u266a -BEN: It ain't too far off.\n-TIFFANY: Oh, my God. (laughing) -Nice job, Kenzie.\n-KENZIE: Thank you. BEN:\nYeah, you crushed. TIM:\nIt was tough out there. Coming out here, I didn't expect\nto do super well in challenges. Like, of course I'm gonna give\nit my all. I'm not a quitter. But it's such an accomplishment that I didn't think I would get\n to check off my bucket list. Yanu started so bad.\nLike, I never thought I was even gonna\nget this opportunity. And now, I just feel like\nI'm, like... really gaining some footing\nin this game. It's just a really,\n really good feeling. Soda and Q she needs\nto land a talk show after this. That was so funny. KENZIE: You were just out there\nhaving a good time today. Q:\nSo far in this game, I have yet\n to really show my ability. That was by design.\n I didn't want a target on me. So in today's challenge, I jumped off on purpose to see if my alliance\n was really strong. So I wanted to go\n into this first immunity not immune at all. Oh, my goodness. -Hunter's Nami, though.\nIs he not?\n-Yeah. TIM:\nThis is like a Christmas present that we have to open. It is a gift-wrapped opportunity because Hunter is alone. Yes, we've made agreements\n with Hunter, but it's not about the alliance. Hunter's a beast\n in challenges, and now that we have him pinned,\nlet's take him out. He's part of the six. Are you gonna beat him\nin an individual immunity? Me? I can. Yeah. That's okay.\nAin't nobody in this game gonna ever win ten\nindividual immunities. Nobody. Tim feel like Hunter is the most physical threat here, which-- debatable, but I would rather go against a physical threat than one that somewhat has some skills off the gridiron competing. All right. Because I committed\nto the six thing with you, Maria, him, Tevin and Tiff. The point is Nami. Nami got the most numbers. Nami was the target. So after today, once again,\nNami's gonna outweigh everybody, and they can control anything. Q:\n Tim right now is trying\nto position himself in this game to get to the end\nin multiple ways. He wants to have\nthe plus-one alliance, but he also wants\nto have his Siga alliance. He also wants to have\n his sub-alliance with Ben. Which is it, Tim? Which game are you playing?\nThe Siga game or the Q game? Well, buddy,\n you are going home tonight, and you just don't know it. KA YA K. N o wa y.

In theaters now. \u266a \u266a CHARLIE: Oh, my God. LIZ: Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. MARIA: Oh. Ooh. Excuse me. Okay. Oh, my goodness. CHARLIE:\n I've been thrown in\n to the lion's den. The Nami lion's den.\n It's four Namis, two Sigas-- me and my ride-or-die: Maria. So that's the one lifeline I have out here is I've got the person\nI trust most in this game. But if they stick together,\n I'm gone. There is zero other possibility. Oh, a fed nap is\na really great feeling. -Uh-huh.\n-I'm drifting off. I may snore. CHARLIE:\n We're napping right now? You guys don't know what it's like to be,\nyou know, me on this day. You know, I wanted\nimmediate conversations. As I'm laying there,\n I'm hoping I'm gonna catch some eyes, you know, that someone's gonna\nlook at me and just go... But I'm just losing it. Calm on the outside,\n but losing it on the inside. I want someone to get up\nso I can go talk right away. SODA (with British accent):\nCharlie. (regular accent):\nI mean, there's literally\nfour Nami and two Siga, -and you're the only other Siga\nthat can be voted.\n-Oh. SODA:\n Anyone from the outside\n looking in would say Charlie is the easy vote\n tonight. Charlie's literally\nthe only person we can vote for if we want to be \"Nami strong.\" But I don't want that to happen\n because Charlie's somebody who I feel is very loyal\n and likes me and just wants to work with me. I'd rather have that than Venus, because over these\n past few days, she's been, like,\n sus about me because I haven't been doing\n one-on-one strategy with her. And then last night,\n after Tribal, she came for me and said,\nI wrote her name down. That tells me\nyou don't trust me. It's four Nami and one you. -Yeah.\n-I'm not gonna vote that way. And I'm gonna talk to Tevin. So we have to really,\nreally make it... No, I get it. I understand. I'm nervous, but I trust you. -I got you. I got you, Charlie.\nYou're okay.\n-Soda. SODA:\n We are not gonna go\n with the majority. That's the story,\nis that it's gonna be Charlie because of the numbers, but\nwe're really going after Venus. I told Charlie,\nI just talked to him because I really love Charlie. I don't know\nwho your vibe with. He... And Maria, too.\nLet's... let me tell you. He's loyal, and he loves us,\nand I have him. Like, we're very tight. But\nI think we should go for Venus tonight. I think\nit has to happen tonight. TEVIN:\n Soda's right.\n Venus has been shifty. She is flopping, she's flipping, and she is\npotentially threatening to the alliances\nthat I've already built. -We're-we're on the same team.\n-Okay. We're always on the same page--\nyou and I. Always. We don't even need\nto have long chats. TEVIN:\n But to be honest,\n Soda and I's relationship has been a little bit\n distant because she talk, talk, talk,\ntalk, talk, talk. Like Yam Yam say, \"You talk,\ntalk, talk, talk, talk, talk.\" She talks, and she's good at making every single person\n feel comfortable. And for that reason,\n I can't necessarily read her. That's why I have kind of\nseparated myself from Soda, alliance-wise. And so the time has come. Try to make a big move, because\n now is the time to start really, really building r\u00e9sum\u00e9, because we're heading\nto the end of the game. The plan is\nto make V feel comfortable so don't play\nher Shot in the Dark. And we vote V out and tell her that the plan\nis to vote Charlie. That's an option. The other option is... it could be a blindside tonight\nagainst Soda. Because V is the one\nthat thinks she's going. Right. Right. I believe the Survivor gods are smiling upon me. And honestly,\nI've been waiting to lose. I've been wanting Soda out so bad. She is my number one target. She's a big threat in this game. Oh. Sure, we have a connection because we're Nami, but I don't care about Nami strong. Soda has to go. I know what kind of game\nVenus is playing, and everyone is all\non board with, like... Venus is snaking, but we also have a chance\nto get out Soda, and she doesn't expect it. I just don't know what kind of game\nSoda's playing. So your proposition is -that we all vote Soda?\n-Soda. TEVIN:\n I trust Maria. She's in the plus-one alliance. I trust her.\nI-I know she's there for me. Oh, you just sit there\nand let people come to you. Your turn with the Tev? TEVIN:\n My gut tells me\n that I can trust Charlie. Charlie's very loyal and sweet and nice\nand he wants to work with me. You ain't going nowhere tonight. So, you, me, Liz and Maria\nvote Soda. Okay. And then we tell Soda we're all voting Venus,\nwhich she wants to do anyway. -Okay.\n-Then you're still safe. CHARLIE:\n When we got back to camp, I was scared out of my mind. And now I've heard Venus\nand I've heard Soda already, and I'm thinking,\n \"What is going on on this beach?\" I don't like it when I'm not\nincluded in conversations. It's obvious\n we should vote for Charlie. But for me, I now have the clarity to realize that that's not the only way\nin this game. Yes, Charlie\n seems like the easy vote, but I'm not here\n to do easy votes. I'm here to play a hard game.\nAnd, sure, playing with fire could come back\nand bite me in the ass, but I want to play with fire. I want to make big moves. I want to make\na name for myself here and show people that I'm\nnot someone to mess around with. What are you thinking\nin terms of threat level -between Soda and Tevin?\n-I have no idea. Honestly, like,\nI can't tell you, at this point. But if I were to say,\n\"Hey, let's throw it on Tevin,\" 'cause I just personally\nsee him as a bigger threat -Right.\n-socially and physically. MARIA:\n Poor Venus. Venus is trying really hard to get some footing\n in this game, but Venus is pretty oblivious. She's not\n reading the room very well. She threw out Tevin's name,\nand so I think that's a mistake. Tevin and I are part\nof an alliance of six. And in my perspective,\nTevin was never an option. -No committing.\n-No committing. I don't want to, like,\nmake you say, \"Well, oh, gosh, she told me this and then,\nlike, she turned on me.\" Like, not committing. -I want to talk\nto everybody again.\n-Ah, so, as in, -you may want\nto work with Tevin instead?\n-No, no, no. I want to talk. VENUS:\n Maria's hard to read. And I'm providing her\n with a really good opportunity and she was unsure\n of even working with me. So I don't know\n why she's wary of me, but, realistically, she's\nputting her Siga numbers at risk by not trusting me. So I just\n need to talk to Charlie and hope that\n I can pull something out. And I am, like, stressing. I really don't care\nthat you wrote my name down, and I could see myself\npotentially working with you. 'Cause I'm gonna\nbe real with you. -I would rather you stay here.\n-Okay. I don't know if you've noticed\nhow close Tevin and Soda are. CHARLIE:\nYeah, I've seen it. The most important thing\nright now -is to break the two of them up.\n-Okay. I'm impartial to which one.\nI have two suggestions. The option's vote Soda,\nand we blindside her tonight. -Okay.\n-Option two\nis if I tell Liz \"Soda,\" Soda and Tevin think it's you, -and then me, you,\nMaria vote Tevin.\n-Like, a three... -Yeah. Like a three,\ntwo, one. Yeah.\n-Three, two, one. CHARLIE:\n Venus says, \"Number one,\nwe could vote out Soda.\" Then she's got this plan where she wants\n to do a blindside on Tevin. -I'm gonna go off.\n-Okay. Um, and we need to connect\nat least one more time, -'cause things change\nso-so quickly.\n-Yeah. It's becoming clear to me that the cracks on Nami\n are more like oceans between continents. You know, they are ready\nto go at each other's throats. Sc ou t is p ro te ct ed b y Si mp ar ic a Tr io and he's in\n it to win it! Simparica Trio\n is the first chew with triple protection.

I don't know where\nyou stand, specifically, from our last conversation.\nI know we said more check-ins, -but I feel we have\nnot done that.\n-No, we haven't checked in, and I don't know where I stand. I want to make sure\nI make the right decision that feels right for me. -Like, character-wise?\nDo you think I can't be true?\n-Yes. -I'm gonna tell you. Yeah...\n-Yes, please do. -I think that's the best thing.\n-Yeah. -When you come at people,\nyou come at 'em.\n-Yeah. Have I come at you? Yeah, you came at me,\nand that puts me off. -Like, negatively?\n-Just like when\nwe were just down at the beach, you're like, \"Oh, so you\ndon't want to work with me?\" -I don't want to be pressured\nbefore I'm ready.\n-Ah. I'm open to working,\nbut, like, don't pressure me. And when I say I'm gonna\ndo something, I'm doing it. Venus just kind of came at me,\n and I'm like, \"Listen, you're 20. Like,\n I've been there, done that.\" And so I was really put off\nby her demeanor. And, honestly,\n I don't trust Venus. She's conniving. She's sneaky. She is dangerous. I don't know. Lack of s... Like, I'm putting, like...\nWe're putting a lot on the line. So, like, this lack\nof certainty, if anything, it's kind of, like, scaring me\noff on the idea as a whole. Maria said that\n she felt like I was telling her what to do,\n which, honestly, like, I feel like that's her ego\ngetting in the way of the game. I wasn't trying to pressure\nyou into an idea. 'Cause at the end\nof the day, it's your game. -You can do whatever you want.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nYou know what? I'm gonna go. VENUS:\n She's probably used to calling\nthe shots and doesn't like being told what to do by someone she\nprobably considers her junior. So I'm a little bit\n in panic mode. This really is a \"make it or break it\" moment\nfor me in this game. Here's where I stand.\nI'm down for Soda. I thought I could\nget Maria on board, but I don't know if I can. -You know what I mean?\n-For Soda? -Yeah.\n-So, it's abort. I mean, I-I might just have to, like, consider\nplaying my Shot in the Dark or something, you know? VENUS:\n I'm scared.\n Charlie could potentially play a Shot in the Dark--\nin which case, if he's safe, whatever\nthe other name is would go home. And that name\nwould most likely be mine. If you're saying it's like this,\nthen I'm gonna be honest. I'm just gonna stick\nwith the Nami four, -'cause that's\njust the safest thing.\n-No... The only person who I'm gonna believe wholeheartedly\n right now is Maria. I want Maria\nto be cool with any plans that we lock ourselves into. I'm hearing from Venus... Yeah. And then Soda wants it,\nobviously, just to be Venus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -So, apparently, I'm okay.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n With this split that we have\n where there are two Tribal Councils, two people being voted out\nin one night, Maria and I, all of a sudden-- the two Sigas\n on a tribe with four Namis-- have the power. At Tribal tonight, -are we pretending...\n-For me, it's easy. I'm just gonna be like, \"Listen, I'm the only Siga\nwho can catch votes.\" Tonight has transformed\n from a night where I was gonna be shaking\nin my boots at Tribal Council because I thought I was\n going home to a night where I'm making, probably,\nthe biggest decision of my game. Everyone on the beach has been\ntalking about getting Venus out. Venus is totally chaotic\n and unpredictable. I don't think I can\n trust her with anything. But Soda-- extremely social player.\n She's a huge threat. So if Maria and I can come out\n of this situation down two to four in numbers\nand, ultimately, make the call\n on what happens tonight, we can take control\n of this game. \u266a \u266a No, I feel good with this. So we're gonna have to split\nthe votes between Hunter, Ben. TIFFANY:\nI think I'm all right with that. TIM:\nOnly because we think\nthe biggest threat here on this Siga camp right now is Hunter. -One, two, three...\n -TIFFANY: We just gonna\n have to do damage control when we get back to Tevin. But I think\nTevin'll be fine, though. He'll be fine. Yeah.\nHe's, like... -Like, he's...\n-I think Tevin will be fine. -'Cause Tevin\nreally rocks with us, so...\n-There's five... TIFFANY:\n Tim's logic is Hunter's\nthe biggest threat on the beach. But what I know for certain: it's not about\n Hunter being a threat. It's less about Hunter being\na threat and more about the fact that they are thirsty\nto get a Nami player out because a Siga player went home last night. They're still trying\nto chip away at Nami's numbers. I don't care about\nchipping away at Nami's numbers, 'cause I know I could do that\neasily on my own. (blows raspberry) -(whispers): Tim?\n-(whispers): Yes. -TIFFANY: Yeah. Yeah.\nNo, first of all...\n-Why? TIFFANY:\nHe's-he's getting real shifty. Okay. Okay. I'm good with that. TIFFANY:\nMy only hesitation right now is if we leave Ben in the game it's gonna be harder\nto get him out, 'cause now\nhe's gonna be on high alert. I, personally, think that Ben\nis a bigger threat than Tim. I can see through Tim. He thinks he's a good liar.\n He's not. Ben-- I think\n he's a sneakier player. He might be\n a secret agent of chaos. So in my perfect world,\nBen would go home tonight and Tim would stay. Yes. Yes. Bro. Tim got to go. HUNTER: The plan tonight\n is to get the four of us-- the three Yanu and me--\nto all vote for Tim. What could go wrong\n is they're all lying to me, and the Yanu people vote me out. There's no doubt\n I'm nervous going into this, but I have an idol\n that nobody knows about, and if I have to play the idol,\nthen I'll just play it. And if I look crazy because no\n one voted for me, that's that. But if that's what it takes, then that's what I'll do. BEN:\n There's only, like, a couple\n options happening tonight. Obviously, my name\nbeing one of them, right? -Yeah.\n-But, um, what are you feeling? I think that we're all\nopen-minded, is the thing. And we also don't want Nami\nto have all the numbers. It's harder to lie to a friend,\n and Ben and I have bonded. He's just, like, such\na sweet and kind, gentle person. And Ben had a panic attack\n that I was there for him for. So Ben and I have formed this,\n like, friendship. That's why this game\n is so complicated, because it's hard to figure out who I, like,\nlike as a person versus who\nI'm gonna work with long-term. I mean, what do you and Tim\nwant to do-- go Hunter? BEN:\nFor numbers, it makes sense. The only thing\nthat makes sense is to try -and equalize\nthe entire playing field.\n-Exactly. BEN:\n My biggest hope tonight is that I can convince\n the Yanu three into going Hunter,\n or else I'm screwed. That simple.\nYou know, like, Kenzie-- she looked hesitant,\nbut I don't have much to go on. I'm in a tough corner, but you can't go down\nnot swinging. The reason I'm talking to you,\nstraight up, is, like,\nI know we haven't had a moment. -And I know Tim and you vibe.\n-Correct. -So...\n-Listen, let... -Man, you got to just\nmake me comfortable, bro.\n-I hear you. Who are we gonna tell Hunter\nwe voting for-- you? I think we might have\nto do a cover like that. But you cool with... We gonna tell this man\nto write your name down. -Yeah.\n-I write his name down. -Yeah.\n-He stands his ass up, he play something,\nand he wrote your name down. -Then what?\n-Yeah, then I'm screwed. But that's Survivor, right?\nYou got to take a chance. But I'm just making sure\nyou aware... That my name could be... -Yeah.\n-When you on the island... But what do they say\nin Survivor? -No risk, no reward.\n-No reward. BEN:\n Would it suck\n to be taken out tonight? Sure. But it's like gambling. If you pulled this off, I would feel high\nthe rest of the game. You know, in the words\n of the mighty Van Halen, \"Time to go bottoms up.\" No, no, no. Listen. He said he's fine with\n Hunter writing his name down. And if Hunter has an idol\n or something, he plays it, he's fine with going home. So... Yeah. 100%. I don't know.\nI can only go on what I read. He's not comfortable.\nHe's not comfortable going home. I'm not a sucker. I'm smarter\nthan what you think. I promise. I'm telling you,\nthat was a bluff. Q:\nOkay. So do you want to go Tim? Dude, I just told you\nwhat I wanted to do. I want to vote for Ben. I'm just telling you\nwhat I'm observing. KENZIE:\n Q is the type of person where we'll have a conversation.\nHe'll be like, \"Tim is the vote.\" I'm like,\n\"Perfect.\" I walk away. I come back from the water well,\nand he's like, \"It's Ben.\" And I'm like, \"Q, what happened? \"Like, you can't just do this. \"What if we have to go to Tribal \"and you don't get a second to\n tell me that the vote changed? \"And why is it\nyou are the only one \"who's deciding\nthe way the votes go? \"Like, we're a three. We're supposed\nto be working together.\" I would rather see Ben go. -TIFFANY: Well, that's what I've\nbeen saying since we got here.\n-And we just... And if... If the three of us\nare in it together, let's take the shot at Ben. -Just so you know.\n-Ben ain't playing anything now. -Yes, he is.\n-Well, do you\nwant to go Tim, then? TIFFANY:\n The stakes are high right now, but Q keeps flip-flopping\n back and forth. Like, \"All right,\nwe're doing this.\" And then you step away,\nand he come back, \"No, no, no. We're doing this.\" You can't do that.\n This is a conversation. You're not just telling us\nwhere to place our votes. -Q is working everyone.\n-He is. \"So do you want Tim?\" If you don't shut your ass up... He's gonna come back\nand be like, \"Vote me, yo. -I've decided.\" (laughs)\n-Oh, God. I'd be like, \"Okay, boy.\" This is not the Q show. At some point, -that ain't gonna work for us.\n-Uh-uh. The way Q is approaching\n stuff right now is worrisome. However, I've got my girl Tiff. The three of us have been strong\nthis whole time, but the way Q is barking orders at us has Tiff and I being aware that this could go into chaos mode very quickly. The plan right now is that we'll\n vote out either Tim or Ben. Tiff and I need\n to be on the same page, so no matter what\n goes off in Q's world, Tiff and I have a foundation. So is it worrisome? Yes. \u266a ( \"G oo d Fe el in g\" by F lo R id a fe at . AT R) \u266a This is a hot flash. (\u266a\u266a) This is a hot flash. (\u266a\u266a) But this is a not flash.

First thing I noticed, a tornado had to\ncome through Siga's camp between the time they left\nand when we got there. 'Cause it was awful.\nThey was living rough. But we had\nto start talking plans, making this game fair, because\nYanu only has three members. Nami and Siga\nstill has the advantage when it comes to numbers. So if we send\nthe right person home, it could even those numbers out\na little more. But, Hunter, at what point\ndo Tribal lines disappear and it becomes, \"This\nis who I want to play with because I can\nsee my path to the end\"? Yeah. It's this weird spot\nwhere the Yanu three are in a power position,\nbecause I'm here by myself, and there's\ntwo Sigas over there, but the majority\nfalls with Yanu. I am the only person who\nhas not voted with any group. And so I would love\nto be a Yanu member right now. So, Kenzie, Hunter's saying, \"I'm willing to join Yanu three. Make it Yanu four.\" -(laughing)\n-Yeah. Okay. Hunter's a free agent,\nso that's appealing. That's a number,\nbut at the same time, Nami has the numbers. What way do we take it? Do we adopt one\nand hope that he's... You hope he's our baby? Or do we, like, chance it that he's gonna go back\nwith his original family? It's-it's a toss-up. PROBST:\nAnd so, Tim, if we stay\nwith this train of thought, you and Ben would be saying,\n\"No, no, no, take out Hunter. Let's get Nami.\" TIM:\nYeah, I mean,\nit's an individual game, and you're not really\nthinking about the alliance. You're thinking about\nwho's threatening. And I think Hunter has carried Nami the entire game by leading and dominating in every single challenge. Yeah, but I'm not tied\nto Nami in any real way other than\nI had to get them here so they wouldn't vote me out. And I'm telling you,\nthis Nami group is not even getting along when the Siga\ngroup is really, really close. And it was clear at last Tribal, the four that have been working\ntogether are still here and still trying\nto work together. TIM:\nI love that Hunter just loves how\nSiga has been able to operate. It's like, \"Siga did this\" or \"Siga kept a close, tight lip,\" but he's never had to show any allegiance to anyone. He's never sat here\nand had to make a decision about one of the individuals\nthat sit amongst him. And I'm assuming he's saying\nthat's a hard thing to do, which I haven't bonded\nto somebody in that way, and I'm looking to do\nit tonight with these three. PROBST:\nBen, it's very clear that Siga\nwas trying to work on Hunter and Hunter was trying\nto work on you two. I haven't heard\neither of you say that you were trying\nto work on each other. I mean,\nI'd be lying if I hadn't heard people try\nto break me and Tim up. How do you respond to that? BEN:\nWell, it's like,\nI try to be personal. I know this\nis a game of deception, but, like,\nit makes it really hard to separate the personal\nfrom the game. And I know it might sound like an open target saying that here, but, like, you know,\nI had a panic attack last night. It wasn't so much about the game as just being like, \"Wow. So much\nintense negativity. How am I gonna\nkeep a straight mind?\" I don't know\nwhich other way to say it. Kenzie woke up at 1:00 a.m.\nto make sure I was doing okay. That was something human,\nwhich is very hard in this game. -That was human.\n-It... Yeah. Like, I would be there for you\nno matter what. It makes me want to cry now,\n'cause it's like, when do you get those moments\nin this kind of game? I came into this game thinking I was gonna be on the bottom\nthe whole time for how I am as a human\nin an individual society. I'm usually people's, like,\nentertainment monkey that, like, they like\nhaving around at a party, but don't want to get deep with.\nBut, like, it wasn't that case. It was a breath of fresh air\nwhere it's like, \"Wow, we've actually\nmade bonds that I think might go beyond this game.\" And then to bring it back\nto what we were saying before about me and Tim, all we can do\nis try and play our game. It's like,\nwe came and did our thing and if that's what got us\nin the end, so be it. But, like,\nwhat a beautiful ride it was. You don't get an adventure\nlike this or make bonds like this\nvery often. Sorry, I know that was a lot. It was great. Beautiful. Kenzie, if it really\nis the Yanu three in charge and your choices\nare Hunter, Tim or Ben, it's got to be\na bit of a Sophie's choice in terms of humans,\nbecause they all three have made very compelling,\nlikable cases tonight. This is really hard for me because I wouldn't be here\nwithout these boys. Like, they literally threw me\nthrough the merge. Sorry. And, you know, I wouldn't be able to, like,\nhave won this without these boys and Tiff, obviously,\nbut, you know, um... And I've bonded\nwith all of them, deeply. So when we were all on the same\nteam today, I was devastated. And the fact that now\nit's up to me to decide, like, which one to cut is a hard pill for me to swallow. It's tough, because, yeah,\nlike, I, like, held Ben's hand\nlast night, and, like,\nI've talked to Hunter, I've talked to Tim,\nI've talked to everyone here on a deep level,\nand it is so human. And that's how\nI make my money at home, is building human connections. So, it-it gets hard for me to separate. Jeff, I know you didn't\nask me a question, but I want to recognize, amongst all these giants, today in the challenge, the smallest person\nstanding amongst us won. When Yanu went 11 days without any positivity,\nthat girl right there-- she smiled, she cried,\nshe kept it together. That deserves more recognition\nthan we're giving. And I understand\nwe have to vote, I do, but I have to give credit\nwhere credit is due. -Kenzie, you did an amazing job.\n-(laughs) -Thank you.\n-You did.\n-All right, Kenzie! You did an amazing job. Thank you. PROBST:\nSo I'm getting the impression this is going to be\na tough vote tonight. It's gonna be\na very tough vote, Jeff. Yeah. All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. \u266a \u266a Sh op E ts y un ti l Ma y 12 th for up to 30% off\n special Mother's Day gifts that go beyond the\n usual suspects.

Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Hunter. Hunter.\nTwo votes Hunter. Tim.\nOne vote Tim. Tim. We're tied.\nTwo votes Hunter, two votes Tim. Tim. That's three votes Tim,\ntwo votes Hunter. Seventh person\nvoted out of Survivor 46: Tim.\nNeed to bring me your torch. Can I give Tim a hug real quick? \u266a Brotherly love. \u266a Tim, -the tribe has spoken.\n-Thank you. -Love y'all.\n-Love you, too. Time for you to go. (crying) (breathing sharply) (sniffles) Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. We'll bring in the next group. They... got me. They got me. Technically, I lost,\n but I didn't have to fake and follow anybody else's game. I was a leader.\n I wasn't a loser. I'm honored. I'm thankful. I'm the sexiest dad\n to ever do this, and I'll get over it. \u266a \u266a All right. So, Liz, where\nis this tribe right now? 'Cause, for a moment, you were\nall together as individuals, -but then now you're back into\ntwo groups in a small group.\n-Yeah. I, actually,\nam really excited that we're split into two groups. For my game, I made a lot of friendships and connections on both sides. So, for the individual game, if you're in the right spot, you're in a good spot tonight,\nno matter what happens. Charlie, what do\nyou read into that answer? It's a very interesting comment. I find it fitting\nfor a person who's in here with four\nof their former Tribemates. There's a little bit more\ncomfort where Liz is sitting. For me, you get\ndivided onto a tribe where you're the odd tribe out and the only person\nvulnerable on that tribe-- it's like I have\na big, red target painted on my forehead. Soda, can you appreciate\nhow that might feel? Might be accurate, might not be. Yeah, I can, I can...\nLike, I mean, it was... I felt it for him, and I, like, I don't think there's any way\nkind of around it as much as, like, I adore him as a person. It's kind of clear where the numbers\nreally are, so... PROBST:\nBut, Tevin, we also reached\na new phase of the game where it's not\nalways that simple. That's true. But, I mean,\njust last Tribal Council, you heard the kind of division\nbetween the two tribes, still. And I don't know\nif people are necessarily willing to let down\nthe tribal lines right now, and they are still trying\nto play a tribe game because they're scared that one tribe\nmay pick off the other. PROBST:\nVenus, where do you sit? The easy vote would be\nfor the four of you to stick together\nand take out Charlie, and there's not really\nanything he could do other than maybe\nhe has some power in the game -or he could play\na Shot in the Dark.\n-Exactly what you said, Jeff. It's a pretty easy vote, but,\num, unlike Soda, I feel like my butt is more on the line\nbecause it's no real secret here that, the other night,\nCharlie wrote my name down. So if anyone here really\nhas to be worried, it's me. PROBST:\nMaria, if you want\nto try to take somebody out, six people\nis a great opportunity, because there's nowhere to hide. Um, I'm gonna paint\na picture for you. -Mm.\n-You're having a party. You get gussied up\nand you put on, like, your favorite red necklace. And you wait\nfor your guests to come. (chuckles) And maybe they don't come. So no one approached you? It's not that\nnobody approached me. It just didn't feel\nlike I had the power. It just kind of felt like,\nyou know, maybe they stayed for a little bit,\nbut not too long. I'm sorry\nyou got all gussied up. (laughing) Y'all, I didn't\nbring my bag tonight. I am staying Nami strong. That's that. Ready to go\nback to the fire and get warm. I mean, that\nis a lot of confidence. Soda, is that just the luxury that comes\nwith having the numbers? Yeah, it's, like, the luxury\nof having four Nami right now. You know, and, like,\nthat's the thing. That's the big steak on the plate right now. So how does that\nchange the dynamic for the six of you? What did you notice\nin terms of behavior? We were just more like,\n\"I don't need to run around,\" which is very, very different\nfrom yesterday. Feeling like\nyou have your tribe there, like, a majority of\nyour brain space is not worried. You could see that\nin people's physical movement in their body. So, Charlie, what's it like to hear Liz say, \"I didn't even bring my bag\"? CHARLIE:\nNot great. Um... You know,\nI knew what the odds were as soon as Maria was the one\nthat won that immunity. And I did my best today\nto just pitch myself to every single person here. And it's so hard\nin the new era, because, you know, I have this\nlittle number in my pocket. Little Shot in the Dark die. And that makes it so people will give me\na little bit to work with. But I don't know if I can\nbelieve one word of it, 'cause they don't want this\nto come out. It's a one in six shot. There are only six people here. That's still scary. I just want to say,\nrealistically, Jeff, I feel like I already know the\nmove that they're gonna play. The fact that\nmy name was written down not only one Tribal ago,\nlike, it's very clear to me that that's\ngonna be their move today. And I'm just hoping that\nthe Survivor gods are in my favor,\nand his Shot in the Dark doesn't work,\nand I get to live another day. All right, then,\nit is time to vote. Liz, you're up. \u266a \u266a Not tonight. Not tonight. (whispering):\nThere is just not any way that\n we could work together. You're way too dangerous. If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Soda. Venus.\nOne vote Soda, one vote Venus. Venus. Two votes Venus,\none vote Soda. Soda.\nWe're tied. Two votes Venus, two votes Soda. Soda. That's three votes Soda,\ntwo votes Venus, one vote left. Eighth person voted out and the first member\nof our jury: Soda. Need to bring me your torch. Wow. -It was you, wasn't it?\nIt was you.\n-VENUS: Yeah. (both laugh) I did not see that\ncoming at all. You played\nan amazing game, Soda. Oh, man. So fun. I love you. I love all you guys.\nIt's really hard. -(laughs)\n-We love you, Soda. (inhales sharply) I hope you crush it, man. (cries) -Soda, the tribe has spoken.\n-Oh... Time for you to go. (sniffles) CHARLIE:\nThanks, Soda. (sniffles) Oh, wow. (sniffles) Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night.

TIYANA: I don't want\n to work with someone who I feel disrespected me. So right now\nmy emotion is saying, \"Vote TK.\" \u266a \u266a If anybody has an advantage or an idol\nand you want to play it... GABE:\nJeff. -Playing this for yourself?\n-(Caroline gasps) Yeah. First vote: Sue. Second person voted out\nof Survivor 47: -TK.\n-Wow. The tribe has spoken. All righty. \u266a \u266a Here. Try my frond. CAROLINE:\nYes. That was so cool,\nyou played your idol. GABE:\nI know, right? Honestly, I just,\nI heard my dad's voice -in the back of my head.\n-There you go. You know... And he was just screaming,\n\"Play it.\" Last season on Survivor, I watched way too many people go home\nwith an idol in their pocket. The dumbest move. With an idol in my pocket. There it is. TIFFANY:\n I should have played my idol. I went home with an idol. They blindsided me with an idol in my pocket. And I'm not gonna\nallow that to happen to me. (Tiyana laughs) KYLE:\n Tribal Council was nuts. There was some things\nthat played out that I didn't really expect. Mm-hmm. GABE:\nUh-huh. Yeah. KYLE:\n I took a risk. I threw a hit at Sue\ninstead of TK. I don't know\n if it's a mistake yet, but I just need to make sure that I'm in the right ring\n with the right bull, so that way\nI'm not the next one going home. Respectful. What? (both cheering quietly) CAROLINE:\n I am so happy to say the vote went exactly the way\n I thought it was going to go. It was so perfect. We did it. Nobody else did it. We did it. We pulled off\na friggin' blindside. Like, that's like, \"Check.\" But Kyle voted for me,\n and I take it personally. That's a man who's underestimating me. And I get the same feeling I got when I went\n into the aviation industry, which is male-dominated. So I totally know how\nto handle guys like that. If we go\n to another Tribal Council, I am gonna get revenge. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a RACHEL:\n Sleeping on bamboo is rough. I don't have the best back.\n(chuckles) And waking up this morning,\nI could barely, like, move. RACHEL:\nOh, my God. ANIKA:\n I did not get more than 20 minutes\nof closed-eyed time because our shelter still looks like\n it's a day one shelter, which made for horrible sleeping conditions. And I woke up\nso, so, so exhausted. RACHEL:\nSo what do we want\nto do for priorities? -I feel like\nwe need to fix the shelter.\n-Floor. -Floor. Shelter.\n-You know, I... Let me just also say, though, we did talk about the crabs\nand said that first thing in the morning\nwould be best. RACHEL:\nTrue, but if we can't get -fire today\n'cause everything's wet, like...\n-ANIKA: Yeah. I think we should\nall be on the shelter really quickly right now. And then all of our bodies\nneed to test it. It'll be so quick\nif we all just do it. -SAM: Okay.\n-Okay. This tribe\n has been focusing on vibes instead of camp life, but obviously those tasks\nstill need to get done. Sam, can you pull this one out? -Where am I pulling it?\n-Just take it out. SAM:\n We're almost\n a week into this game. We're running on fumes\n at this point, and we have this entire\n fishing kit right in our camp. And instead of being like,\n\"Hey, let's all go and try and get some food today,\"\nwe're sitting here saying, \"Hmm. That bamboo\ndug into my side a little bit weird last night.\" What if this big boy\nwe take out and just fill in with a smaller guy\nand put rocks under it? It's bamboo. It's not the Ritz-Carlton. Quit trying\n to make it the Ritz-Carlton. It feels like Anika\nreally wants to have control of everything\nthat happens in camp life. Where do you want me to put it? Like, something around here, because the last thing you want\nis for it to cave in. SAM:\n She believes that she's the figurehead\n of the Gata tribe, but I'm just like, \"Give me a break.\" I'm rolling my eyes and\nI'm trying not to say anything. I'm trying not to be\n so obviously irritated, but I'm just, like,\n I'm pissed off. ANDY:\n People talk\n about a Survivor wall. And the Survivor wall\n is when, you know, you're trucking along, and then you wake up one day, and it all just,\nit comes crashing down. And I think this is\n the case for two people in particular-- Anika and Sam. ANIKA:\nSam, if you're able to create\na base right here, I support the two. If not,\nit's gonna be way too heavy. -Where do you want me to get it?\n-Chop it? ANDY:\nLike I said from the beginning,\n I want to gather data. And what people tell you is,\nlike, second-level data. It's okay, but there's\nbetter, more substantial, cleaner data out there,\nand that is people's actions. And when Sam\n and Anika are bickering over the clothesline,\n it's like, okay. That's real.\nThey're not faking that one. I don't know.\nI think this will hold. As long as we just don't,\nlike, throw things. We, like, put 'em on there\nlightly, and it'll be okay. ANIKA:\nI don't think\nit's just that, Sam. It's the pure weight\nof the wet clothes. But it's staying in now. I-I know now with four pieces\nof clothes on there... -...that are partially dry.\n-Okay. I'm just saying, scientifically\nand mathematically, the weight will pull it in. Okay. Then let's machete it here. ANDY:\nOoh. We've been sawing it. That's\nbeen more successful, Sam. Okay. -Yeah.\n-Yeah. ANDY:\n I do currently feel\n like I am on the bottom, but there's trouble in paradise\n here on Gata. And so the festering conflict makes me\n really, really valuable. And it would be\na very sweet turnaround for me. I think I've got some life here.\nI do. Good work, team. -ANDY: Great job. Great job.\n-Good work. ANDY:\nYeah.

ROME:\nI want to know\nthe Survivor record for most fish caught in a day. Yep.\nThat's the sole purpose of that. Yeah. That's the only reason. Just so I can beat it by one\nand be done. AYSHA: Since day one,\n Rome has been talking about, \"I can't wait to get out there. \"As soon as we get fishing gear,\nI'm gonna be out there all hours of the day.\" And so I knew as soon as Jeff said, \"Fishing gear,\" I was like, \"Oh, we're\ngonna have to deal with Rome.\" If you have\na six-foot Hawaiian sling, you have a four-foot\nkill radius, essentially. You want to be that close\nto the fish, and then bam. -Okay. Okay.\n-So it doesn't\nhave time to react. At random times,\nthere'll just be water that comes into the mouthpiece,\nand I have to go up to the top and, like,\nreadjust it and, like, just hope\nit doesn't fill up again. AYSHA:\n If you ask Rome, every piece of fishing gear\nis labeled \"Rome.\" ROME:\nOh, you want to try it? GENEVIEVE:\nYeah. So, the current's\nreally strong underwater. -Like, you'll feel\nyourself moving away.\n-Is it? Okay. Okay. -Okay, I'll wait.\n-(chuckles) Catching a fish\nwith a Hawaiian sling is so difficult to do. Like, only a few Survivors\nare really, like, doing it, like, and\ndoing it all right, you know? KISHAN:\n Rome is the only one, successfully,\nwho has caught fish, but Rome has also been the one who's been\n using the fishing gear for a majority of the time. Yeah. (groans) -You okay?\n-Yeah, just... AYSHA:\nExactly. TEENY:\nYeah. I think I just\nhave a different mindset. Like, if somebody was\ncatching fish for me, like, bro, I'd be\ngetting the pot ready. I'd be trying to make a fire. -Yeah.\n-This is just ridiculous, man. AYSHA:\n I bet you -he thinks we're so lazy.\n-TEENY: He does. We're spending\n 24 hours a day together, and that's obviously going to expose us\nin our raw forms-- what our annoyances are, what our patience levels are. ROME:\nYo! There was a shark about\nten feet away from me just now. I know. (laughs) TEENY:\n Which, for me, works out\n perfectly because Rome is a large personality person. Why didn't\nyou bring the flippers? I hate flippers, but, uh,\nno flippers, no problem. (excited chatter) ROME:\n And I realized, hey, I'm kind of good\nwith the Hawaiian sling. That's a great feeling\n because now I realize, \"Man, I don't have\n to starve out here.\" -Pass it off. Ah!\n-(laughter) But then I started to realize,\nokay, I had to make the fire. -AYSHA: Oh, there we go.\n-TEENY: There we go. ROME:\n I had to clean the fish.\n I had to get the fish. So, like, at this point, how appreciative are you? And why should\nI even give you some? GENEVIEVE:\n Rome has caught a few fish. They're, like, this big, like the kind\nyou would have as a pet, and... Rome decided to eat two of the four fish himself. -Can I put this whole thing\nin my mouth?\n-Yeah. AYSHA:\n We only got the smallest bite. I'm literally, like... You're trying to savor it\n as much as possible. Like, \"This is all I'm gonna get\nfrom Rome. I know this is all\nthat he's willing to hand over.\" Excuse you? You did absolutely\nnothing to deserve this. Absolutely nothing. You aren't\neven in my alliance, Aysha. Why should I give you\na big chunk of meat? So guess what I did. The last two fish,\nI ate them right next to Aysha. Right next to her.\n And I made sure I was smacking a little bit, so she could hear it,\n so she could know, \"Listen,\n if you want some of this fish, you better\n put in some work, too.\" (spits) -Huh?\n-I said,\n\"You just spit that on my back.\" Mmm. \u266a \u266a ANIKA: You'll like it.\nYou should try it. -Pineapple?\n-ANIKA: Yeah. Hmm. I've also ne--\nHere's a weird one. I've never had watermelon. -Oh, my God.\n-ANDY: Oh, my God. -How is that possible?\n-Not at any barbecue? Nothing? -RACHEL: Sam...\n-No.\n-ANDY: Why not? Wait, why? ANIKA:\nSo, you haven't been around a lot of watermelon\nis what you're telling me? No, there's...\nNo, I'm around watermelon a lot. I just, like, don't eat it. RACHEL:\nAnd you have no desire\nto just see what it tastes like? Like, barbecues and stuff,\nI just don't eat it. -Yeah, I don't,\nI don't really care.\n-That's so crazy. Sierra, this kid\nhas never had watermelon. -What about different berries?\n-What?! Or pineapple. -That's your favorite, right?\n-Yes. -What about, like,\nblueberries, raspberries?\n-I've had blueberries. Uh, um,\nI've probably had a raspberry. -I don't remember it well,\nbut I've had blueberries.\n-(gasping) Oh, my God.\nYour 24 years of life. RACHEL:\n Sam's very funny. There's just things\nthat he's never tried that boggle my mind. Okay, let's\ngo through vegetables. -Eggplant?\n-Never had it. -Zucchini?\n-Never had it. -Squash?\n-Never had it. RACHEL:\nBean sprouts? I don't know. Probably not. Broccolini? -I don't know what that is.\n-Okay. He hasn't tried\nthe most basic-ass foods. This man is an, is an enigma.\nI do not understand him. Um, tomatoes,\nyou said you don't care for. SIERRA:\nWhat about,\nlike, an heirloom tomato? I don't know what that is. \u266a \u266a SIERRA:\n It looks... -What do I look like?\n-I mean, you look normal. -Like, you just have long,\nlike, beachy hair.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Thick. Like,\nit's not, like, knotted. ANDY:\n My game so far has not been what I expected,\n but right now I'm-I'm working it.\nI'm finagling. You know, Anika and Rachel,\n they're a duo. So it's pretty simple. I want to gain a majority\n with Sam and Sierra. And I'm really trying\n to line this up so that Sam and Sierra\n feel like they can trust me. Now, I feel like I already have a pretty good bond\n established with Sam. We've been talking game\n since day one, but without Sierra,\nI'm dead in the water. SIERRA:\nI know it might not be tonight,\nbut Sam and I, we are just nervous\nbecause we need your number. ANDY: My game is just\nto hitch my wagon to you. -Yeah.\n-Like, so we're, like... -We need you to know, like...\n-I know. Yeah. -Look, do you...\n-Do you know? Like... -Do you know?\n-Do I? Yeah. -Do you want\nmy Shot in the Dark?\n-No. I can give you\nmy Shot in the Dark. -What?\n-Just to borrow it. -Just to give me before Tribal?\n-Just to give you\nanother action. I mean, I would love that. -All right. -SIERRA: I'm not sure I'm ever going to be able\n to trust Andy, like, fully, but he's willing to give me\n his Shot in the Dark before the next Tribal. And that, to me,\nis like, \"Holy crap. Okay.\" I-- That would make me\nfeel so much better. I'm giving,\nI'm giving you my game. SIERRA:\n I don't need\n his Shot in the Dark, but that absolutely built\nmore trust with me. And that's exactly\nwhat I needed from Andy, 'cause I still was getting\na little nervous about him. But now it's like, \"Shoot,\n you know, he trusts me.\" So, yeah, maybe\nwe could possibly work together. \u266a \u266a (hammering) -This is a nut.\n-GABE: Oh, really? (grunts) -And you can eat it?\n-Yeah. GABE:\nMmm. That's pretty good. In a game like Survivor, things are ever-changing. And now that TK is gone, I don't want Kyle\nto leave this game. Kyle is somebody that I believe can be controlled, that will be Tuku strong,\n even if the ship is sinking. And that's\nvery attractive to me. I really,\nreally want to work with you. -I really do.\n-Likewise. And I just think\nyou're such a decent guy. -Thanks, Gabe.\n-And I... I love the way\nyou're approaching this game. He's on the bottom right now, but if I could bring him\n into a position of stability, I don't think\n he would ever turn against us. I mean, shoot. I could probably\ncall on that guy to be my limousine driver\nfor the night after this game is over, and he'd fly out from Michigan\nto Baltimore and do that for me. This is something that I would\nlike to stay between us. Yeah. You got one, you got two. Exactly. Yeah. KYLE:\n According to Gabe, Sue and Caroline\n will not vote for one another. And as long as you have them, you got two extra votes with\nyour vote everywhere you go. But that's cooked in my head.\n I don't like it because if he's trying to make\n relationships with me, he's gonna want me\n to flip on Tiyana. And there's no way in hell that\nI'm gonna try to go after her unless I absolutely have to. So if I can get\n Sue and Caroline roped in, then there's a way that I can\n keep Tiyana around, and we'll be able\nto have the numbers to go after Gabe successfully. KYLE:\nGabe's been kind of shady. He thinks that you and Caroline\nare his goats. Hmm. -And he told you that?\n-Yeah. -Hmm. -Kyle is at the bottom, and he's desperate\n to save his life, but I will never forget\n that Kyle wanted me out. So there's no way I could live\nwith myself giving him a pass. How do you feel about him\nstaying in the game? Well, I hate\nthat we're talking today, 'cause I wanted\nto wake up thinking, \"Let's just be pumped,\nbe juiced, be all positive, not talking so much game.\" I'm the type\nthat I need to focus on... -And I respect that. That's why\nI'm willing to squish it now.\n-Yeah. -Yeah, okay.\n-Because I see that... I see that you require that, -and I'm willing\nto give you that.\n-I do require that. I require positive thoughts,\npositive tribe vibes, positive everything. -And having\nany negative vibes...\n-All right. I'll bring it -to you later.\n-...shooting out the-- Yeah. KYLE:\n Sue, man. Sue. I just told you\nthat somebody thinks of you as a goat in this game, and it doesn't even faze her. She is irritated at the fact\n that I'm trying to bring any kind of information\nin this game to her attention. Sue, what do I do with you? \u266a \u266a -CAROLINE: Guys, there's a...\n-Guys, there's a boat. What is happening? There's a boat. -There's a boat!\n-TEENY: Oh, my God. SIERRA:\nWhoo! -Okay, let's bring it in.\n-This is it! All right, you ready?\nGather round. One, two, three. -Oh!\n-Oh! KYLE:\n This is beautiful. A journey means that you're\ngonna have opportunities. And after\n that conversation with Sue and how it went,\n I could be in trouble here. So this is, like, exactly\n what I need to help my game. Y'all want to volunteer? -I don't mind...\n-RACHEL: Oh, yeah? ...if we all are okay with that. I'm fine with that. I'm great with that. Anika wants\n to go on this journey, and everybody\n seems cool with it, but I don't want her to go because that's my next target\nin this game going on a journey\n to potentially get an extra vote\n or Safety or something that could\nreally throw off my plans. No, don't tell everything! Yeah, don't tell everything! SAM:\nTell us everything. -Oh, okay.\n-Oh, okay. Yeah. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. A'ight. -TEENY: All right.\n-ROME: All right, guys. Absolutely the worst-case\nscenario for all of us would be to send Rome because I believe that Rome has\nsomething in his pocket already. So I don't want Rome\n to go on a journey and potentially get an extra vote, a Steal\na Vote, an amulet, anything... anything that's gonna\nhelp him in this game. \u266a \u266a [C le ar s th ro at ] Sounds like you need to\nvaporize that sore throat.

I am so happy.\n-Monica, right? -Anika. Yeah.\n-Anika. -I'm sorry.\n-I always say,\n\"Monica without the M,\" -and then people\nremember it immediately.\n-I got you, got you. -It's nice to meet you guys.\n-Oh, my God. Nice to meet you. -Yeah, right? Oh, my gosh.\n-Oh. I'm so happy\nit wasn't you last night. -Oh, my gosh.\n-No, wait. Literally, me, too. -Kyle,\nit's so good to see you again.\n-Thanks, guys. So who was it last night? -You guys really want to know?\n-Of course we want to know.\n-I hope it's TK. -ANIKA: Rome's like,\n\"Gossip now.\"\n-(Rome laughs) TK's gone. -Yes!\n-You're kidding. -Hallelujah.\n-You're kidding. Oh, my gosh. I just\ncouldn't stand his ego. I was not a fan of TK at all. He was just being way too cocky,\n way too arrogant. So that was\n exactly what I wanted. I wanted him out the game first, but, look,\nI'll take the second boot. -Sam, right? Is his name Sam?\n-Yeah, Sam. -Okay, and then what's, uh...\n-ROME: Sierra? -KYLE: S-Sierra?\n-The blonde one? -Is she kind\nof the prettyish girl?\n-Yeah. -My whole tribe\nthinks they're a couple.\n-Okay. Is there\nanything tying on there? -Well, they both\nhave couples back home.\n-Oh. Sam is actually engaged. -Oh, okay.\n-Oh, yeah. Okay. They kind of made a really\ntight, like, bond or whatever. ROME:\nMy tribe has been making jokes\nthat they're a couple this whole time. KYLE:\nWe all kind of figured that Sam was gonna be running\n the show at Gata, but you can't\nrun the show by yourself. And so now that Anika\nexposed this information to me, I feel like I can use that\nto my benefit in the future. ROME:\nSo, listen, my tribe,\nit's Sol and Aysha. They are\nrunning the show over there. -And, like,\nyou know what I'm saying?\n-Damn. -And, yeah, like, they've...\n-Is it rubbing people -the wrong way, kind of?\n-It's rubbing me the wrong way, but I think that -they already have, like...\n-They're already jiving. Yeah, they're already jiving. No. I've not... Not one person\nhas talked strategy -with me this whole game.\n-KYLE: Dang. ROME:\n I want them to feel like\n I'm on the bottom, and I don't have anyone\nthat I'm working with over here. Is that true? May or may not be the case,\nbut guess what. As long as they\n go back to their tribes and say that Sol and Aysha are the ones running the show\n over here, that's all I need because I need targets\non Sol and Aysha's backs. -Oh, God. Okay.\n-All right, guys.\n-Good luck, guys. ALL:\nHope to see you again. -Best of luck to you.\n-Best of luck, guys. -Do your damage.\n-Lovely meeting you.\n-Good luck. \u266a \u266a Okay. Whew. (exhales sharply) Dang. Okay. So I have to pick once. Wow. This is super risky. So I've got a one-in-three that I'm\ngonna gain an advantage. If a doctor told me\nthat the surgery was gonna have a one-in-three chance of\nme dying, I would never do it, but I have no choice. I'm playing with fire\neither way. My heart's beating. I am nervous at this point\n because right now, with the losing\nstreak we have as a tribe, I cannot lose my vote. All right, money. (sighs) Dang. Oh, my gosh. This sucks. I'm not in a position\nwhere I can, I can lose my vote. I've already lost one vote. I can't risk two. I'm not gonna\ngo back in this bag. Damn. This is scary. Now, it's a 50-50 chance\nif I reach in again, but the risk is so, so big. (sighs) I-I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna stick\nwith my one Lose a Vote. Let's do this. (exhales sharply)\nPlease, please, please. This is exactly\nwhat I needed, baby. Now I have an idol\nand I've got a Steal a Vote. Oh, my gosh. I don't know if I was\n really expecting to have this much power in the game\nthis early, but, hey, look, I told myself this is what I wanted to do,\nand I'm doing it, baby. That's how you do it\non Survivor. If I can show this\nto my alliance, this solidifies it because there's no way that\nthe alliance would flip on me since I've got a Steal a Vote. Oh, my goodness. I feel like\nI'm running this game right now. I feel like Survivor 47 is mine. We might as well\nrename it to Survivor Rome. Ooh.

I'll give you the lowdown, then. -Okay. Are we ready\nfor story time?\n-Yeah. So, for starters,\nthey sent Kyle and Rome. SAM:\n I have a feeling\n Anika is somebody who is looking out for herself,\n first and foremost. So I have a lot of doubt\nabout whatever Anika says probably\n is not the entire truth. And if not, why am I not getting\nthe full side of the story? They asked me,\nwere you two dating? -(Andy laughs)\n-Who? -ANIKA: You two.\n-You two. -Us two?\n-RACHEL: Oh, my God.\n-(Andy laughs) Yeah, they were like, \"You got\nto tell us. You got to tell us. Is Sam and Sierra,\nlike, a thing?\" SAM:\n This is ridiculous.\n I am engaged. Hannah, babe,\nif you're watching this, I am not in a relationship\nwith Sierra on Survivor. It is a strict, strategic relationship.\n I promise you. I'm thinking about you\nthe whole time, and I'm talking about you\nevery day. So they're not a thing. -GABE AND SUE: Really?\n-TIYANA: What? They actually both have fianc\u00e9s,\nbut Anika said -that they're jiving\non a whole different note.\n-GABE: Yeah. -They're basically like\nhead dogs at the moment.\n-Uh-huh. -Wow.\n-TIYANA: What the hell?\n-Yeah. That's crazy. SIERRA:\n What? I'm 27 years old. He's 24 years old. He's engaged. I'd better be engaged\nwhen I get home. So it's like, \"Come on.\" Like, it concerns me that now\n there's this speculation that Sam and I\n are working together because that could really\n blow up both of our games. So I'm not really sure where\n they're getting that from, but that's something we\ndefinitely need to keep in mind moving forward in this game. KYLE:\nThere are three scrolls. And so two of these scrolls\nare Lose Your Vote. Oh, no. One of them is an advantage. -TIYANA: Holy...\n-KYLE: And you have to pick. And so I put my hand in the bag,\nand I nailed a Lost Your Vote. No. -I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.\n-...if you lost it two times. So I lost my vote there. So my ass is burnt\nfor the next Tribal Council. -You had a choice\nto play the game.\n-RACHEL: Yeah. And I chose to save my vote. \u266a \u266a ANIKA:\n I don't want Andy knowing\nthat I lost my vote, but I need to make sure that my alliance members\n are aware of that if we go to Tribal. The thing is, there wasn't\na choice to play the game. -I had to play the game.\n-Okay. And I had to reach in\nand get a scroll. And I unfortunately got one out\nand it said, \"Lose Your Vote.\" -Okay. No worries.\n-Okay.\n-And... -Okay, good.\n-Fair. Yeah. SIERRA:\nDon't let it stress you, though. Don't let it get in your head. You're good. I think I'm actually okay. -You're okay.\n-Yeah. Even though I lost my vote, Sierra, Rachel and I--\n we're solid. They've given me the confidence\nthat I'll be okay. I pick one,\nand it was Lose Your Vote. But in my head I'm like,\n\"There's no way I'm going for the second one.\" Like, I'm not losing my vote\nfor two Tribal Councils. So I was like, \"You know what? I'll take the loss,\nand that's it.\" No, I don't. It was up there. I just left it in the bag.\nI left it at the table. Yeah. There is no way in living heck that I'm telling Aysha and Sol\n I got an advantage. I was lying my butt off\n to them, man. They have no idea. And right now I feel\nlike I'm playing it perfectly. -All right. So, anything new\nto actually say, or...?\n-(chuckles) -You think I would go out there\nand lose my vote? Come on.\n-Oh, my God. So what'd you get this time? -Steal a Vote.\n-Get out. Yep. So, guaranteed first Tribal\ngoes the way I want. TEENY: Every advantage Rome\n brings back, it kind of pushes me more and more into\nthe alliance with him, Rome, Genevieve and Kishan, because\nthere's not much I can do when Rome has an idol\nand Rome has a Steal a Vote. You know? Like, those are things that I can't really\nfight against. So I'd rather swim with. \"You now have power in the game. This advantage\nallows you to steal a vote.\" TEENY:\n If I'm reading it right, Rome sees me, Genevieve, him and Kishan as the Lavo four--\n the group that's gonna go into the merge together\n and play this game. I'm so happy for you and us. TEENY:\n I believe Rome's loyal. He's shown us with telling us\nabout his advantages, and he's shown us\nby being very clear that he does not have\nany interest in working with Sol and Aysha. \u266a \u266a SU BJ EC T 1: W ho 's co mi ng i n th e dr iv ew ay ?

What up, Jeff? PROBST:\nLavo and Gata\ngetting your first look at the new Tuku tribe. TK voted out\nat the last Tribal Council. ROME:\nWow. Shocking. Way to go, guys. (laughs) PROBST:\nAll right. -Shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge?\n-(all assent) -First things first.\nGot to take 'em back.\n-Come on. Come on.\nDon't make me fight you for it. Yeah, okay. -Nice.\n-Let's go. Once again,\nimmunity is back up for grabs. -(Rome exhales)\n-For today's challenge, one tribe member is gonna climb\n to the top of a tall tower, leap out into the ocean. You're then gonna climb over\na crate and back into the ocean where you will\n retrieve a key underwater. You're then going\n to cross a balance beam and swim to the finish. The rest of the tribe is going\n to run the same course, only in pairs, retrieving two more keys\n along the way. Once you have all your keys,\n you will use them to unlock and solve\n a Survivor seahorse puzzle. First two tribes\nto finish win immunity, safe from the vote, nobody\ngoing home from your tribe. In addition,\nyou're playing for a reward. -Want to know\nwhat you're playing for?\n-(all assent) PROBST:\nIt's not food, but it'll help. SUE:\nYes! -PROBST: A large tarp.\n-Hammock. Wow. Two hammocks, the tarp. (all exclaiming) -I'll take that.\n-Duly noted. -Yes.\n-Second tribe to finish--\nno hammocks. One small tarp will still\nmake a big difference. -Yeah.\n-PROBST:\nThe last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers, got nothing for you but a date\nwith me at Tribal Council... -Hell no.\n-...where someone will be\nthe third person voted out of Survivor 47,\nand as a penalty for losing,\nI will keep your flint. Tuku, you are playing\nto earn yours back. Before I send you out\ninto this challenge, let's just take a moment,\nbecause when you're at home and you see this, you think,\n\"Oh, that'd be so fun.\" Now that you're here\nin the middle of the ocean with a very tall tower\nand a very deep ocean, anybody here willing to say,\n\"It's a little more intimidating than I thought\nit might have been\"? -Absolutely.\n-Definitely.\n-Really? -Yeah.\n-PROBST: Kishan, what is it now that you're out here? I never knew how to swim until four months\nbefore I came out here. -Wow.\n-And I took swimming lessons, so, of course, there's that\nvoice in the back of my head that's like, \"Dude,\nyou just learned how to do this. \"Now you're doing this\nin an ocean. \"You're doing this exhausted in a deep, deep ocean.\" It-It's-it's scary. It becomes\nvery real, real quick. -The ocean is definitely not\na swimming pool.\n-Exactly. All right, Lavo,\nyou have one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Cannot be Aysha.\nWho's it gonna be? -Me.\n-PROBST:\nGenevieve gonna sit out. Now, I'm curious. I got to ask. Kishan, you admitted\nswimming is not your strength, but you're gonna participate\nin this one. Why? You got to believe in yourself. It's a mentality thing.\nAnd if you don't believe in yourself\nand you start doubting yourself in these moments,\nit's gonna carry forward. That's why you apply\nto be on Survivor right there. All right, Genevieve, take\na spot on the sit-out bench. Everybody else,\ngive you a minute to strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it.\n-Yes! Let's go! -SUE: Yes, I agree.\n-CAROLINE: I agree. Sounds good. Like, I'm-I'm gonna... All right, fine. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? -Go!\n-GENEVIEVE: Go, Lavo! Gonna be Kyle, Rome\nand Andy in the water. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:\nYou got to climb to the top\nof that tower and leap. TIYANA:\nYeah, watch yourself. Let's go! Go! -Nice!\n-PROBST:\nKyle in the water for Tuku. -Look at Rome getting some air.\n-SOL: Let's go, Rome! AYSHA:\nNice, Rome! PROBST:\nHere comes Andy. -(whooping)\n-SAM: Come on, Andy! PROBST:\nYour next stop is that crate. You got to climb up\nand over the crate. -SUE: Keep going, Kyle!\n-PROBST: There goes Kyle\nin the lead for Tuku,\nRome right on his tail. Kyle with a nice dive. Rome in the water. SUE:\nGo, Kyle! -Kyle up quickly with the buoy.\n-(whooping) Rome made it look easy. -SOL: Let's go Rome!\n-KISHAN: Let's go, Rome! PROBST:\nAndy underwater for Gata. He's struggling,\ndidn't get it on the first go. -SIERRA: Go, Andy!\n-Now you've got\nthe balance beam. -SUE: Go, Kyle!\n-If you drop,\nyou got to go back. -CAROLINE: Yes, Kyle!\n-SUE: Go, Kyle! Kyle has the buoy for Tuku. -SOL: Go, Rome!\n-Rome's across the balance beam. -SAM: Go, Andy!\n-PROBST: Andy has the buoy\nfor Gata. Kyle, no issues\nwith this challenge at all. -You're good, Tuku! Go!\n-Go, Tuku. You're now running in pairs. Andy on the balance beam. SIERRA:\nTake your time. PROBST:\nHe falls, got to go back. -It's okay, Andy! You got this!\n-PROBST: You're good, Lavo! Go. Go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Gabe and Sue.\nThere they go. TIYANA:\nYes! Andy's still working\non that beam for Gata. Run, run, run, run,\nrun, run, run, run, run! SIERRA:\nYeah! PROBST:\nOh, and a big fall. Nope. Nope, you're no good. -Foot hit the water.\n-(overlapping shouting) Come on, kid! For Lavo,\nit is Kishan and Aysha. -GENEVIEVE: Come on, Kishan!\n-ROME: You got this! -Ready? Okay.\n-Ready. Ready. Go. (Genevieve whooping) Yeah, Kishan! -TIYANA: You got this, Sue!\n-PROBST: Sue taking on -that balance beam.\n-CAROLINE: Let's go! PROBST:\nSue is across. -Let's go, Sue!\n-GENEVIEVE: Go, Kishan! You got it! You got it! PROBST:\nKishan jumps.\nHe's back in the ocean. PROBST: Taking on a challenge\nthat terrifies him. Said he was afraid of heights,\nsaid he was afraid of water, but he's out here doing it! Crawl, crawl, crawl. PROBST:\nAndy drops again. -Andy!\n-Crawl! PROBST:\nGata in dead last. -ANIKA: Crawl!\n-PROBST: Gabe's good. He's got the buoy. Tuku in the lead now. -Come on, Andy.\n-PROBST: Andy just needs to keep his feet out\nof the water. SIERRA:\nYou got it, Andy! Nice work! PROBST:\nYou're good, Andy. All right, guys, you got this. -You're good, Gata!\n-Yeah! Dig deep! You're good, Tuku! Go! -Kishan taking his time.\n-GENEVIEVE: Good job, Kishan! Undoing the knots,\ntrying to release that buoy. TEENY:\nYou got it, you got it. -Oh, no.\n-PROBST: Kishan falls. Got to go back. It's gonna be Sam and Anika\nfor Gata. Ready? Let's go. Let's go! SUE:\nYou got it. Looking good. Yeah, baby. Let's go. Gata trying to catch Lavo now. Kishan and Aysha\nhave taken a long time on this part of the challenge. So much so that Gata,\nafter a disastrous run by Andy, is now back in it. We got a challenge. SOL:\nThere we go! There we go! PROBST:\nAysha has the buoy. Can she keep her feet out\nof the water? -Good job.\n-SOL: That-a girl, Aysha! PROBST:\nAysha's across. You're good. Anika's across. Here comes Sam. Nice work! PROBST:\nGata has now passed Lavo. SIERRA:\nYeah! It's now Lavo in last place. SUE:\nGood job, TT! -Let's go!\n-PROBST: Tiyana with the buoy. SUE:\nYou're rocking it, girl! -Here comes Lavo.\n-ROME: Good job, Aysha. Go, Gata! It's gonna be\nRachel and Sierra now for Gata. You're good, Lavo! Go! (whooping) PROBST: Sol and Teeny\nnow for Lavo, the last pair. You're good, Tuku.\nStart working on the puzzle. One, two, three. -SAM: Attagirl, Si.\n-PROBST: Rachel and Sierra leap from the platform. (indistinct shouting) There goes Sol and Teeny\nfor Lavo. Whoo! You got this, -you got this.\n-Let's go, guys. PROBST:\nThe faster you get back here,\nthe sooner you are working on that puzzle. It's a Survivor seahorse puzzle. -PROBST:\nIt's Tuku in the lead still.\n-Let's go. PROBST:\nPieces got to stay on the table. Now you've got the beam and one final buoy. Rachel untying the buoy. She's got it free. Sol, nice job on the beam. -Making that look easy.\n-Good job, Sol! PROBST:\nGata's across! You're good, Gata! SAM:\nCome on, girls! -You got this, Teeny.\n-(groans) PROBST:\nNo, Teeny's got to go back. Come on, you guys. Got to get everybody\nup here first. -You got it.\n-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Start working on the puzzle. -Let's go, girls.\n-It's gonna be Anika and Rachel on the puzzle. It is Gabe and Caroline\non the puzzle for Tuku. GENEVIEVE:\nGood job, Teeny. PROBST:\nTeeny has the buoy for Lavo. It's all good. It's all good. Teeny back in. Got to go again. Come on, come on, come on! TIYANA:\nIt's all right, guys.\nYou got it. Got a lot of time. Here we go. Nice and methodical. PROBST:\nDay seven, Survivor 47. Yes, yes, yes, yes,\nCaroline, yes. -Let's go, Teeny. You got this.\n-Teeny at that same spot. Teeny, you're good. Let's go. ROME:\nThere you go.\nLet's go, guys! -GENEVIEVE: Good job!\n-AYSHA: Right here, right here. ROME:\nLet's go. Right here,\nright here. I'll take the buoy. -I'll take the buoy.\n-Looking for two tribes. Rachel with a piece for Gata. Gabe and Caroline\ndoing a nice job together. Rachel with another piece -for Gata.\n-Beautiful. Gata's got some momentum\nright now. Lavo would like to get\na little momentum, get in this. Does this go here? No. Caroline trying\nto get another piece for Tuku. Will it fit? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it does.\nThat's another piece for Tuku. I got it, I got it, I got it. PROBST:\nRachel with another piece. Lavo now in trouble\nand decidedly in last place. The only tribe that hasn't gone\nto Tribal Council. It is Gata and Tuku\ndoing a great job on the puzzle. That's it. That's it. PROBST:\nLavo in dead last. The inevitable appears\nto be coming. Yeah, that one right there. That one that-- That was it,\nthat was it, that was it. That was literally the piece. -I saw it.\n-Yeah, this could be right. PROBST:\nIt is Gata, then Tuku. Yes. Yeah. -SAM: Yes. Yes.\n-PROBST:\nGata with another piece. Gata down to three pieces now. This is in the deep freeze.\nLavo's going to Tribal Council. I'm gonna call it.\nGenevieve can only watch. Rachel trying to get\nthat piece in. She's got it. Gata down to their last piece. For immunity and reward. -Gata has it.\n-(screaming) Gata wins immunity and reward--\nlarge tarp and two hammocks. It now just comes\nto a nice finish for Tuku. SUE:\nYou got it, Gabe. There it is.\nTuku down to two now, as Tribal Council's inevitable\nfor Lavo. Tuku down to their last piece. (cheering) PROBST:\nThere it is. -Tuku wins immunity and reward.\n-(cheering) Safe from Tribal Council, sending Lavo to Tribal Council\nfor the first time this season, where somebody\nwill be the third person voted out of Survivor 47. Ah! Come on! Gata, congratulations. Nobody going home from Gata.\nNo Tribal Council tonight. In addition, nice reward\nwaiting for you back at camp. Hot day like this,\nthat tarp will help a lot. Two hammocks will make things a little more comfortable. -Well done.\n-Thank you. Tuku, nice job. (overlapping chatter) Yeah. PROBST: Nobody going home from\nTuku, no Tribal Council tonight. Smaller tarp waiting for you\nback at camp. -Well done.\n-Appreciate it. -In addition...\n-(whooping) ...you also earned\nyour flint back. -Thank you.\n-We'll take it. All right, swim out,\nenjoy the night off. -Big jump?\n-PROBST: Celebrate. -Go, guys.\n-(laughing): Yay! (Kyle howls) All right, Lavo.\nNew part of the game, Rome. You have not had\nto vote somebody out. Some fans would say you haven't\nactually played Survivor until you've gone\nto Tribal Council. What are you feeling right now? I mean, me personally,\nI'm feeling a lot of nervousness. I mean,\nI came back from the journey and told my tribe\nexactly what happened. So they all know\nthat I don't have a vote. So, really, I have no say\nin what happens tonight. So I'm just gonna be sitting\nthere like a bump on a log. So, who knows\nhow tonight's gonna go? All right, Lavo,\nTribal Council tonight, where somebody will be the third\nperson voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing,\nI'm gonna take your flint. Sorry for you, Genevieve. -(Genevieve sighs)\n-You will have a chance\nto earn it back at the next challenge. Swim out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council. SOL:\n Apparently,\n Rome does not have a vote. Just from reading\n his body language, I think that guy's lying. I don't believe\nwhat he's saying right now. But we just need\n to be prepared for everything because who knows\n what could happen tonight? Outwit, outplay, outlast.

I to ld m ys el f I was OK with my moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. With my psoriatic\n arthritis symptoms. But just OK isn't OK. And I was done settling. If you still have symptoms after a TNF blocker like HUMIRA or ENBREL, RINVOQ is different\n and may help. RINVOQ is a once-daily pill that can rapidly relieve joint pain, stiffness,\n and swelling in RA and PsA. Relieve fatigue, and stop further joint damage. And in PsA, can leave skin clear or almost clear. RINVOQ can lower your ability to fight infections, including TB. Serious infections\n and blood clots, some fatal; cancers, including lymphoma\n and skin; heart attack, stroke,\n and GI tears occurred. People 50 and older with a heart disease\n risk factor have an increased\n risk of death. Serious allergic reactions\n can occur. Tell your doctor if you are\n or may become pregnant. Done settling? Ask your rheumatologist\n for RINVOQ. And take back what's yours. AbbVie could help you save. \u266a \u266a AYSHA:\nYeah. We win as a team,\nwe lose as a team. Yeah, that was a tough one.\nThose are the breaks. -How about we move on?\n-TEENY: Yeah.\n-GENEVIEVE: Mm-hmm. Let's not dwell. So... what now? ...does anyone want to go home? -Yeah. Who wants\nto volunteer to leave?\n-(Kishan laughs) All right. Okay.\nWe got that out of the way. TEENY:\n This loss means that it's time for lines to be drawn, lines that I've been really,\nreally procrastinating having to show. My number one is Kishan. And I know that we're leaning more towards working\n with Rome and Genevieve. That means the decision is now who to vote out-- Sol or Aysha. I have to decide and try to hurt as little amount\nof people as possible so that I can still keep\nthis position I'm in, which is pretty good. How are you feeling? -I mean, I feel so good\nwith you guys.\n-Mm-hmm. I feel scared,\nthe same as I did about Rome. (sputters) AYSHA:\n Then how would you feel\n if it was Genevieve? TEENY:\n I think it's the safer option. AYSHA:\nI would love more than anything to target Rome, but I cannot, because we have\nthis large suspicion that he has something that he found on this beach,\n because that man was looking like\n his life depended on it. And then there was a hard stop, and he just stopped looking. If we focus today\non getting out Genevieve, 'cause I just don't think\nwe can get Rome out. -I don't see us there.\n-No, I don't. Neither do I. -We can't take that risk.\n-Exactly. But I just want to let you know that, like,\nif they start talking -and it seems like\nit's gonna be one of you...\n-Mm-hmm. -Okay. Okay.\n-I do. -I really do.\n-I appreciate that. I would not be comfortable\nwith you going home. With Aysha,\n I want her to feel like I'm good with her and that I'm\ngoing with our original plan, that I'm working with her\nand Sol and Kishan. Though, in small ways, I'm trying to give her little warnings that, \"Hey, \"just maybe this might not go\nthe way you want. \"And if it doesn't,\nare you going to be down \"to work with me\nand vote out Sol to preserve your own life\nin this game?\" So, the plan is actually going\nto be Aysha, -but we want Sol to play\nhis Shot in the Dark, so...\n-Okay. -I hear you. I hear you.\n-That's.... and... Yeah. You know, if I had to choose\none, I would choose Sol. ROME:\n Okay. What's your reasoning? Teeny started\n to break it down a little bit, and she made perfect sense,\nbecause right now, for my game, the biggest threat is someone\nelse finding that next idol, because I have\nto play mine tonight. You made such a good point. -'Cause I have\nto play my idol tonight.\n-You have to. Which means that there's gonna\nbe an idol back out here. Yes, absolutely. And you know\nit's gonna be a mad dash. The second I get back to camp, I'm hitting the jungle\nin the middle of the night. -Exactly.\n-Like, I'm that type of person. And you know who else would? -Sol.\n-Sol. I have wanted to vote out Sol since the start of this game. I cannot stand the dude\n at this point. So the fact that it ended up\nturning from Aysha over to Sol, that just made me smile\near to ear. I'd be willing to write\nSol's name down lickety-split. I cannot wait\nto do that tonight. So as long as we can get him to not play\n his Shot in the Dark, then the plan is foolproof. -But...\n-Oh, do you? -Yeah.\n-'Cause I have no ... clue. -Yeah, well...\n-So... I'm, at this point,\n99% sure it's gonna be Aysha. -99? Bro.\n-Mm. -Yeah.\n-99% is a done deal, and we've been here\nfor 30 minutes. I mean, it wasn't really a lot\nof conversations... -Really?\n-...to have. Yeah. Like... -Ah...\n-They-they feel like\nthey want to keep you around -because you're strong.\n-Thank God. And you do carry us through\na lot of these challenges -and different parts of it.\n-All right, man. And I don't have a vote,\nso I literally don't have a say. So all I'm doing\nis getting information -from other people, you know?\n-Yeah. ROME:\n Being in character\n and playing it like I don't have a vote, it comes natural, man. I can lie in Survivor all day long. I'm sorry, Mom. I know\nyou're gonna be disappointed watching this right now, but I'm lying\n for my life in the game. I'm playing hard, man. If Boston Rob was the godfather, there's got to be\na godson somewhere, right? SOL:\n Is there any chance that you're coming up to me, saying, \"Hey, Aysha's the name\"? I mean, why... why would I...? To make me feel good, and then it's like,\n\"Hey, y'all, it's-it's Sol.\" It's a... it's a... it's a question that... -I mean, I don't know...\n-It's a potential, right? It's a potential? I guess, but, like, I just don't\nsee the point in me doing that. -Yeah.\n-'Cause I don't have a vote. So, like, I'm trying\nto stay good with everybody. -Right, right, right.\nAll right, cool.\n-Just in case, like... -You know what I'm saying?\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, that would only hurt me\nif I was like... That's right. That's right.\nThat's right. That's right. I-I get what you're saying,\nbut, yeah, that just doesn't... Yeah. No. Like, I...\nTonight I can't. I just got to be honest\nwith everybody and stay mellow. That's-that's my best game plan,\nlike I said. That's all I could do, so... SOL:\n Rome is talking to me\n like I'm an idiot. \"Sol, I don't have a vote, \"so I'm not gonna get voted out. \"Just so you know, everyone is gonna vote Aysha out.\" I don't know if Rome\n is just completely clueless... If I was you,\nI'd just draw the continent. Asia. Like...\n(laughing) Yeah. That would be\nvery cool of me. ...or if Rome is one of the best Survivor players ever. ROME:\n Me and Sol just talked, and -I told Sol that\nthe plan is gonna be Aysha.\n-KISHAN: Mm-hmm. \"And if you want to be\non the right side of the vote, you should just vote Aysha.\"\nAnd he was like, \"It sucks, but I want\nto stay in the game, so...\" There was no inkling\nhe was scared -about maybe using\nthe Shot in the Dark?\n-I made him feel really good about it, so... Is there any world where\nwe bring in Aysha on this four? -Yes.\n-TEENY: Yeah. KISHAN:\n Aysha's genuinely someone I would love to work with\nin the future because\nshe is such a strategist. This is also a bit\n of a selfish move of looping Aysha into the plan\n because I want it to be that Teeny and I tell her, so\nthat, going forward, she knows, \"We saved your butt 'cause your name was gonna be\nthe vote today.\" Okay. So he does for sure? -TEENY: He's not telling us.\n-Right. TEENY:\nThere's only one guaranteed, I feel, safe situation to do, and it is vote Sol. AYSHA:\n The fact that they trusted me with that information about\nRome's idol means the world. But I don't want Sol to go home. I think the worst thing\n in the world that we could do is keep Genevieve\nand Rome together. KISHAN:\n Yeah, but, hey... KISHAN:\n Aysha is not budging from wanting\n to vote out Genevieve. And, you know, that's definitely\nvery concerning, 'cause if Aysha keeps discounting\n any potential other options, that's really hard\nto work with going forward. She was not... -KISHAN: She was not budging.\n-...hearing us. TEENY:\n I feel a very close personal connection with Aysha, and I know we're both rooting\n for each other in this game\n and want to work together, but she's kind of digging\n her own grave at this point. TEENY:\n So tonight the question is, if Aysha won't work with me and vote out Sol, is it worth\n keeping her in this game? But, yeah,\n somebody's gonna be upset. Somebody's going to be betrayed. But I have to make the decision\n that's going to guarantee me\n to go further in this game. Th is i sn ' t Ch ar mi n! No wonder I don't feel\nas clean! Hurry up Dad! You've been in there forever!

So let's get into it. The first Tribal Council\nfor this group. -Rome, every first...\n-(Rome laughs) -Why are you laughing?\n-I just was, like, hoping\nthat you didn't pick me first, but it's okay.\nLet's do this, man. We here. PROBST:\nIs there a curse about getting -the first question?\n-TEENY: No. -That's just Rome.\n-ROME: I got a superstition about sitting\nin the front middle, and I'm sitting\nin the front middle. So, I mean, I already got\na lot of nerves already. -Yeah. We're already 0 for 2.\n-ROME: Yeah, exactly, exactly. -Not looking good.\n-Yeah. No, sir. Let's do something different.\nLet's go to Genevieve. -(Rome sputters)\n-Genevieve.\n-Thanks, Rome. What I was gonna ask was,\ncoming into tonight, what do you think this tribe\nhopes to be with tonight's vote? GENEVIEVE:\nI think everyone\ntoday was a little emotional because tonight's\nkilling someone's dream, and so the hope is that the five\nwho go back are still cohesive. So, Sol, do you get the feeling that tonight's vote is based on trying\nto make the tribe stronger, or this is about alliances and\nI got to make sure I'm in one? I thought\nit was about alliances. I felt really good\nwith who I was paired with, but I got a very uneasy feeling\nin my stomach, and so... So, as we sit here right now,\nyou're feeling that uncertainty? Yeah, it's, uh,\nit's not a good feeling that I'm feeling right now. Can you overthink it, Rome? You can definitely overthink it. Once you get paranoid\nand, you know, you start talking with people, and\nyou might say the wrong thing, and that might make them think,\n\"Oh, man, this person's\nnot really trusting me.\" Even though\nthey weren't gonna be the vote, now they will be the vote\njust because they're getting\na little bit too paranoid. PROBST:\nAysha, do you feel the same way?\nThat it can literally change like that?\nEverything was fine, then somebody says the wrong\nthing and everything shifts? Yeah, it can change\nat the drop of a hat. Like, you could have\na conversation with a person, and an hour later\nthey're not being as reassuring. It's like, \"Oh, okay,\nmaybe that may not be the plan. \"Maybe that was just something\nin the moment just to tell me. Maybe I should be worried.\" PROBST:\nKishan, the dangerous part of somebody feeling\non the outside is something as simple\nas the Shot in the Dark or some other advantage\nor idol in the game. Did you sense that there's someone\nfeeling on the outs today? I did not sense that, and\nthat's probably a misperception on my end, because, for me,\nI'm strong to the core four. And you know, I want to go ahead and move forward\nwith whatever we believe in. -So...\n-PROBST: Who's the core four? -I'm not gonna say.\n-But there is four? -Maybe.\n-PROBST: Teeny? TEENY:\nI mean,\nwhen he says \"core four,\" you have no choice\nbut to believe him. It's interesting because people who aren't involved in the plan\nhave to know something. So you have to be talking\nto everybody. And if that means that you feel\nlike you trust somebody enough to where you're locked in\nwith them, and you don't need to reassure\nthem as much, then there you go. Sol, that sounds like a message. If you're part of the core four,\nthe core four is saying, \"Dude, come on,\nwe're good. Relax.\" SOL:\nYeah,\nthat's what it sounds like, um, but this is Survivor, and I'm trying to find out, is this, like, part of the game\nwhere I'm going crazy, or is it, they're just having, like,\nreal conversations with people? You know what I'm saying?\nAnd I hope I'm not going crazy. PROBST:\nKishan,\nit's a fine line because, as Aysha was saying, you want to make sure\nyou're solid, but if you dip into the well\none more time, you might say the wrong thing. Do you worry about that as well? KISHAN:\nYes. It's so easy\nto get tripped up. And that did complicate things, which is, I think,\nwhat's causing this uneasiness,\nbecause now we're just like, \"Holy cow. How many\nother different conversations \"were happening that \"I wasn't a part of or\nsomeone else wasn't a part of? \"Maybe if we just took\na step back \"and kind of kept it\na bit more calm, maybe those feelings\nwouldn't arise.\" Today felt like you're in\nthis trio of best friends. Like, you have a group chat.\nYou talk every day, right? Three people.\nBut then you're just walking. You know,\nyou're walking your dogs, and you look in a restaurant, and the other two\nare having lunch. And you're like,\n\"Wait. They didn't put that \"in the group chat.\nLike, what's going on? \"Like, I'm so confused. Do I go up?\"\nBecause I'm a part of this. Like, I should feel welcome\nto come up. Genevieve, Aysha's example\nis straight out of real life. Sometimes\nit's a misunderstanding. Sometimes there's more to it. Is that a relatable experience\nfor you out here? Yeah. You don't know\nwhat is real and what is not and what's a bluff and\nwhat is not and who's looking. Like, you know, Sol's making\neyes at Aysha across the back. And you don't know,\nlike, how much do I dial in on this or not? PROBST:\nEven you just saying that\nnow lights up Teeny, who looks at Sol and says, \"Why\nare you making eyes at Aysha?\" You're fighting\nfor a million dollars. This is Survivor right here. You're in the belly\nof the beast right now. We're about to vote.\nIf you're not playing, it probably is you, and\nit should be you going home. So, Kishan,\nwhat's your take on this? All that cohesion\nthat we talked about? Yes, it's nice,\nbut it's honestly just a facade. And we pushed it off as long\nas we could until we needed to. And at the end of the day,\nwe knew that one person's name\nwill be written down, and they will be voted off. And that's a harsh reality\nthat we all knew when we came in today. All right, we feel good to vote,\nor do we need to talk more? I just want\nto say one more thing. I don't want\nto call anybody out, but I hope the person\nthat agreed to vote with me sticks to that. Otherwise, I know that I could\nbe at risk of going home, or an ally could be\nat risk of going home. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAnd on that note, it is time to vote.\nAysha, you're up. \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. One second, Jeff. I got full faith in the people\nthat I have faith in, but I went on a journey\nat an absolute perfect time, and, you know,\nI was able to get an idol that's good\nfor one Tribal Council, so I'm gonna use it now, but\nI don't think it's me tonight 'cause I got faith in the people\nthat I got faith in, and I'm just gonna ride\nwith that. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast\nfor Rome will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Rome,\ndoes not count. Genevieve. Sol. One vote-- Sol. \u266a \u266a Aysha. One vote-- Aysha, one vote-- Genevieve,\none vote-- Sol. Aysha. Two votes-- Aysha, one vote-- Genevieve,\none vote-- Sol. \u266a \u266a Third person voted out\nof Survivor 47-- Aysha.\nNeed to bring me your torch. (sighs)\nYeah. That really hurts. I'm not gonna lie. Wow. Was it you, too, Sol? No. Aysha, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Good luck.\n-SOL: Thank you. -Bye, Aysha.\n-Thank you.\n-Love you, Aysha. Grab your torches,\nhead back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by\n CBS and TOYOTA. Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org SAM: Andy's like Survivor George Costanza. Andy!

(Liz crying) PROBST:\nLiz, do you feel comfortable talking about\nwhat you're feeling? I'm pissed! PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... MARIA:\n Q is a number that\n I can use to vote with me. I definitely want\n to keep him around. Q kind of blew up his own game and has been causing chaos\n at camp. Tonight, I'm betting I can keep my idol\nin my pocket because Q is going home. -...it's gonna be\nreally, really bad.\n-Right, but... Kenzie is having cold feet,\n but at some point, you've got to make a move. We can take Tiff out tonight. Maybe we don't tell Kenzie. If I keep waiting\n for the light to turn green, it may not turn green. We have one chance. So I'm gonna have\nto run the red light. TIFFANY:\nI don't think that anybody here thinks\nthat Q is best for their game -at this point in time.\n-And yet the last two Tribals, everything was swirling\naround Q. \"Q's going home.\nQ's going home.\" Nope. Still here. If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Eleventh person voted out and\nthe fourth member of our jury: Tiff. The tribe has spoken. Thank you. (sighs) I broke my own Survivor rule. I should have played my idol. \u266a \u266a KENZIE:\nFinal seven. -Final seven.\n-Holy crap. Wow. This Tribal was the first time\nI've been left out of a vote. And it's the worst. It's the worst feeling ever,\nbecause I'm like, \"What did I do\nto not, like, be... in the club?\" Like, who...\nDid I... Like, why am I not trustworthy? Like, I'm so confused. And I'm mad because this was my idea\n to blindside Tiff, and now somebody else\n is getting the credit. Like, I'm mad at myself\nfor not seizing the opportunity. Ugh.\nI just feel so dumb. I feel so dumb. I was having this whimsical,\n amazing time. I just let the game\n get away from me. I got blindsided, too, you know? I don't know if you want a hug\nright now or anything. I... -No, I...\n-I don't even know. -I just, like...\n-Yeah. Like, why wasn't I included,\nyou know? -Yeah.\n-Like, I know people\nwere probably worried -I would tell her.\n-I think that was the worry... Which I understand completely. I mean, I'll just say this. -It wasn't my move.\n-Yeah. -Do you know what I mean?\n-Was it Maria? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. I knew it. CHARLIE: There's always\n fallout after Tribal, but this vote\n was different because everybody who returned\nto camp voted for Tiff except Venus and Kenzie. And the way\n they were left out left them really feeling bitter. So, my thinking was,\n talk to Kenzie because this game is\n all about working with people, adapting to what's\nin front of you and keeping your options open. -It's a great move. It's-it's...\n-I know. -It's my move!\n-I know. -That's why I'm so mad.\n-I know. Right now, we just have to,\nlike, bide our time, you know? There's no time.\nThere's six days left. -Well, it's, like...\n-And I just, like... Just, like, find\nthe right moment, you know? I have to find that idol,\nis what I need to do. This is the first time\nI've been wrong in the game, but maybe\n this is what I needed to get my head back on straight\n and realize I came out here\n to play and to win. I'm just gonna have\nto get a little bit more crafty, pay a lot more attention. I can turn this around. -Final seven together, huh?\n(laughs)\n-Yes. -We're gonna rock out, Ben.\n-Oh, we're rocking out already. We're gonna have a good time. We can have our final five\nright here. MARIA:\nYeah, it'd be a good final five. This Tribal couldn't have gone any better. Oh, my God. (laughs) This vote was my idea, and I was able\n to get this group together-- Q, Liz, Ben, me and Charlie-- and just pull off\n an epic blindside. And it was just, like, the sweetest feast\nI've ever had. (laughs) This has lit such a fire in me. I do see the end, and I'm like,\n \"Is it possible that maybe\n we are the final five?\" I could do this again.\nLet's do it again. (laughs) The blindside-- even though\nwe were on the wrong side of it, was a blessing in disguise. -Yeah.\n-We got rid of big competition -and Maria put a huge target\non her back.\n-Yeah. Let Maria think\nthis is her move. Don't give off the fact\nthat you're upset, and realistically, it's gonna\ncome and bite her in the ass. Maria's played\na very low-key game where everyone can tell\nshe's a potential threat, but this is the first time she really\nlet her freak flag fly, and she's announcing\nto the world, like, \"Hey, this is my move and I'm here to play.\" And it's scary\nbecause Maria has a strong three with her, Charlie and Ben. Siga three needs\nto be broken up. Yeah. But tomorrow's a new day,\nand we're still in this game. -Exactly.\n-Yeah. KENZIE:\nDay 20. Ugh. What a mess. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a -Morning.\n-Good morning. Ooh. MARIA:\nYou sleep okay? KENZIE: (short chuckle)\nOh, no, I did not. It's all good. I'm, like, shocked\nTiff didn't play her idol. MARIA:\nI guess that means it's time\nto start looking, right? KENZIE:\nYeah. (mouthing) Q: With Tiff idol leaving\n in her pocket, we're thinking it's gonna\ncome back to play at some point. We don't know if there's\n something out there just yet, but the only way\n to find it is to look for it. I know. Okay. CHARLIE: Idol fever has struck Nuinui beach. MARIA: Yeah. CHARLIE:\n It was sort of\n a domino effect this morning. Q started looking,\n then I started looking, then Ben started looking,\n then Venus started looking, then Kenzie started looking,\n then Maria started looking. And everybody's looking for... (imitates drumroll) ...Tiffany's idol! \u266a \u266a CHARLIE:\n An idol at this point\nof the game changes everything. So, as much as I don't\n want to look for an idol because I'm exhausted\n and starving and want to save my energy, it's a necessity at this point. VENUS: At last Tribal, for the\n first time ever in this game, I was on the wrong side\nof the vote. So, I need to flip the script. I need to find this idol\n and I need to find it quick. Q:\n I've looked from the front to\nthe back to the top to the side. Oh, man. I'm exhausted. VENUS:\n I've gone through probably some\n of the toughest times that I've ever had\n in my life here. But today, the thing that calms me down is A: I know this island\nbetter than anyone, B: I know\nwhere Randen found his, and C:\nI know where Tiffany found hers. So I have something\nto work off of, of where to look\nand where not to look. And I'm like, \"You know what?\n People are going hard. Let's go through literally\n every single corner.\" And I take my little stick,\n and I'm pushing leaves, and I'm pushing leaves. And... I found it.\n I found it first! And I was so ecstatic. I immediately started\n to walk away so that I could go find\n a corner to read it. But then I realized,\n like, \"Hey, that is not the move right now.\" So I U-turn it, and\neveryone's still up and looking. So, I bide my time. And it's so hard. MARIA: Yeah. As someone\nwho's been looking for 20 days, it's so hard to hide the joy\nand excitement that is building up in my heart. Where's Liz? (snoring) I'm gonna go around the bend\nand come back. Wish me luck. And finally, I'm alone. \"Congratulations. \"You have found\na hidden immunity idol. \"When played at Tribal Council, \"any votes cast against you\nwill not count. \"The last time this can be used\nis when there are five players left in the game.\" I just got myself a ... idol. Go, Venus. Go, Venus.\nThis is sick. I have the idol in my hands. And it is just\n an amazing feeling. Like, \"Wow, Venus, \"you're not blind,\nyou're not stupid. You actually got this.\" And if I play my cards\n correctly, I make it to final four. Like,\n \"Hey, you underestimated me \"since day one, and look who's here,\nand look who's not.\" [ si re ns b la ri ng ] No, stop! Once in a generation\n tornado outbreak continues across Oklahoma.

So you think you can\ndisrupt a tornado? In theory. But in the field. I got it wrong. We never had a chance. You want one? We got twins! Twins! Oh my God. They're combining.

Pretty cool. KENZIE: Being left out\n of the vote sucked, but I have definitely, like, thought about it, and I was\njust... I got too comfy cozy. I wasn't on my p's and q's. I wasn't paying attention. Trying to balance\n your own individual game with a group of individuals that all have\n their own individual games... Everyone's lying. You never know\n who's telling the truth. You don't know\nwho's working with who. Ugh. Even though it feels like\nwe're on the bottom, we're in the perfect position of being in the middle\nof this... this war. KENZIE:\nRight now, like, the only person that hasn't lied to me\n is freakin' Venus, which is hilarious, but, like, really, she's the only one\nwho hasn't lied to me. I'm so curious\nas to what her next move is because she's not\nreally hiding it. KENZIE:\n I like Venus now.\n I like her as a person. I never\n in a million years thought we would be\n working together, but here we are, me and my messy,\nsweet little friend. I don't see it. (Venus laughs) KENZIE:\n Venus is just, like,\n looking at trees, and is like, \"It's not here.\"\n And I'm like, \"You have to move some leaves,\nhoneybun. Like, what are you doing?\" It's not looking good. KENZIE:\n Venus' technique\n for idol-searching, I think, is to follow around people\n that are idol-searching and wait for them to find it.\n(laughs) Girlfriend is not\n really looking hard. She's, like, kind of does this\nwith a stick, and she's like, \"No.\" And meanwhile, I'm, like, digging holes, and she's like... Any luck? (laughing):\nI'm like, \"Venus, what?\nWhat are you doing?\" I doubt it. KENZIE:\n Who knows? Maybe she has it, and she's bamboozling us all. But... I think\nshe's just waiting for someone\nthat's close to her to find it so she can have the tea. VENUS:\n It is so relieving to know that even though people are\n still scattering about, looking for an idol, I don't have to worry\nabout going out and, like,\nsolving a riddle, or, like, going and finding a second part\nto this idol. I have it. But no one will\n ever catch a whiff of me having this because I don't see any benefit in-in someone knowing\nthat I have this power. Oh, my God. I know.\nI cannot believe it. VENUS:\nSo it's very much a timing game. Like, when is the right time\n to play this? No, she shouldn't. -People were just\nreally good at lying.\n-Yeah. So, it's stressful,\nbut it's so comforting. It's, like,\nthe sweet, sweet comfort. Like, I want to... Mwah. I love you. It's, like,\nI think this is my best friend on this island right now. Hello. What's going on? Okay. -We have lots to go through.\n-Yeah. First of all, congratulations. Thank you.\nI'm happy to have had my moment. -We have not... even talked.\n-That was, like, amazing. -That was amazing.\n-Yes. I'm so glad\nto have been a part of it. -I'm really proud of you.\n-Thank you. -That was... that was...\n-It was scary as hell. -That's big stuff\nthat you pulled off last night.\n-Yeah. -That was big stuff.\n-I know\nwhat the repercussions are, -but, like...\n-Yeah. Thank you\nfor doing that with me. Oh, my God. Of course, you know? Maria wanted the Tiff vote\nto be something that she drove, she controlled, 100%, because the more\n you can clearly claim that a move was your own, the easier it is\n to sell and to pitch to a jury\nthat's looking for a player who had real influence\nin the game. And that's where\nMaria's head is at. But it's also\n a very double-edged sword, because Maria getting all the\n credit from the Tiff blindside has made her\na huge, huge target. I mean, people would be silly\nif they didn't see that, like, you and I\nhave been working together. You're a threat. We voted cor...\nvoted correctly every time. -Every single time.\n-Taken out three people. -You're a threat, I'm a threat.\n-Yeah. -I did want to talk\nto you about Q.\n-Okay. What are you...\nWhere's your head at on him? I think we can use Q\nfor one more vote, -because Q trusts me,\nand I trust Q.\n-Yeah. -I don't know how that happened.\n-Yeah. Like, I do think\nhe would vote with us -for one more time.\n-Yeah. I've been playing this game\n with Maria since day one, and we have been lockstep. We've been talking about going\n to the final three together. But Q is,\n as far as I can tell, in Maria's pocket,\nand I want him out of the game. So this move and the buildup to this move\nis really where... I have seen my thinking and my route to the end maybe start to diverge\nfrom Maria's. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Luckily, people have realized\n Maria is a huge threat. Nobody likes Q, so he's kind of\non the outs as well. So the two big threats--\n Q and Maria-- have made themselves\n very well-known. They are peacocking, for sure. Like, everyone can see that\ntheir tail feathers are out, and that the attention's\non them. Maria-- she got to go. I thought she was just... a sleeper. -But Charlie, yesterday,\ncame to me, he was like...\n-Yeah. \"That was a game-winning move,\nand it wasn't mine.\" -And I was like...\n-Okay. \"Well, there's hope.\" I mean, I want Q out, but... Maria is obviously\nrunning things. -Yeah.\n-What do you think? Oh, I think it makes sense. -If we can pull it off,\nthen Maria's got to go.\n-Okay. KENZIE:\n There's seven of us left,\n and we need four. So the best thing for me is to\nfigure out who I can work with to get Maria and Q out of here, and then at the final five,\nwe can battle it out from there. Kenzie, have you\nchecked the beach? I'm gonna be honest. If Q doesn't get up and look\nfor it again, I'm gonna assume -he has it.\n-Okay. And Maria's been gone alone\nfor a long time. LIZ:\nThat's what we're talking about. -Yeah, that's what\nwe've been talking about.\n-VENUS: Okay. And she will think again\nnext time before leaving us out of a vote. It's not about that.\nIt's about... -she's the kingpin.\n-She's... She's the kingpin, she... She's got the best story,\nthe best moves. Yeah. No, she's got to go. VENUS:\nWe will have the majority. A hundred percent. I am certain one\n of the Siga three may be open to potentially working with us,\n especially with Charlie. I've questioned\n how strategic he is, how cutthroat he can be,\nbut it seems like he's seeing that writing on the wall\n and realizes that he can't go to the end\n with Maria no matter what. And eventually, he's gonna\nhave to cut that cord, and I hope he sees\n that now's the time, while everyone's still on board. KENZIE:\nOkay, so what are you thinking? CHARLIE:\nI think Q is in Maria's pocket. Oh, 1,000%, he is. -Yeah?\n-It's not even a pocket anymore. It's like she has, like, a...\na full bank vault that Q is stuck inside. KENZIE:\nYeah. CHARLIE:\nI was not...\nI was not cruise director... -Yeah.\n-last night, you know? -KENZIE: Ugh.\n-So...\n-VENUS: That's so funny. CHARLIE:\n In the buildup\n to the Tiff vote, I wanted Maria\n to have sole credit because I need someone that I can sell as\nthe biggest target in the game. If that can overshadow\n any attention on me for the moment, that's probably what's best\nfor my game right now. At this point in the game, -there's seven people.\n-Mm-hmm. And that has somehow\nbecome the strongest pair. The whole stuff with Q\nand that whole vote was a big... -I think, a big wake-up call\nfor probably everyone.\n-Yeah. Charlie and Maria\n are super close. They're in the Siga alliance. But Charlie has no real\n r\u00e9sum\u00e9 moves, and he knows it. He has been Maria's, like, jester\nfor this whole game. And he's-he's a smart kid,\nhe knows that. So I think Charlie's ready to make a move on Maria. So, who would you rather\ngo first? Too early to say or... I think too early to say, but... We'll just see whoever wins\nand go from there. I'm just saying.\nYeah, 'cause, like, I feel like anyone could win. I've been building trust and relationships with Kenzie and Venus so that I could,\n if I wanted to, make a move\nagainst Maria and Q at any point. I think we... we all know\nwhat needs to be done, or else we're all screwed. VENUS: They will win. -Mm-hmm.\n-Yeah. So they are, like, public enemy number one and two right now. CHARLIE:\n At some point,\n I have to ask myself, \"Is going to the final three\n with Maria handing Maria\n a million dollars?\" You have to start\nthinking about your own game. And I'm feeling... my gut start to go\nin two directions. One way is gonna win, and it might be\n making a move against Maria. \u266a \u266a Help your family\n warm-up to mornings.

Because I'm at risk\nfor pneumococcal pneumonia. Come on. I already got\na pneumonia vaccine, but I'm asking about the added\nprotection of Prevnar 20\u00ae. If you're 19 or older with\n certain chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease,\n or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal\n pneumonia. Prevnar 20\u00ae is\n approved in adults to help prevent infections from 20 strains\n of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal\n pneumonia. In just one dose. Don't get Prevnar 20\u00ae\n if you've had a severe allergic\n reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened\n immune systems may have a lower response\n to the vaccine. The most common\n side effects were pain and swelling at the injection\n site, muscle pain, fatigue,\n headache, and joint pain. I want to be able\nto keep my plans. I don't want to risk\nending up in the hospital with pneumococcal\npneumonia. That's why I chose\nPrevnar 20\u00ae.

He's got to go back. Charlie really whipping\nthrough this. Here comes Maria. -Good job, Charlie.\n-Charlie's won back-to-back. No way. Charlie, you're good.\nStart working on that track. Charlie's at the final stage now\nwith a big lead. Ben has to go back.\nHere comes Kenzie. -Ouch.\n-PROBST: Maria drops\nand hits herself. Maria's got to go back. Charlie working\non that snake track now. You've got two balls\nyou're gonna have to drop one at a time. -(sighs)\n-PROBST: Kenzie, the last,\nmost difficult section-- getting down off that beam\nwithout dropping the ball. You're good, Kenzie! -(whoops)\n-Kenzie moving on\nto the snake track. -LIZ: Okay.\n-PROBST: We got two\non the track, five still working to get here. -Aah! Come on.\n-PROBST: Q drops.\nGot to go back. -LIZ: Ugh!\n-Liz drops.\nShe's got to start again. -Aah!\n-Venus drops, almost at the end. She's got\nto go all the way back. There is a learning curve.\nYou're gonna drop a lot on that snake track. The goal is to get better at it and start\nto figure out that touch. Once you do, it will get easier. Liz, Maria,\nthe final section of the beam. Maria, you're good. Move on.\nLiz, very close. Liz, you're good. Move on. Booyah. Good job, Liz. Venus, another shot. Again, very close. No, Venus! It dropped. You did not cross. Sorry.\nYou got to go back. You got to be in control\nof that ball. Q very close, few steps away. You're good, Q!\nQ now on the snake track. Maria now has some momentum. She's about a third of the way\nthrough the snake track, moving very slowly, confidently. Q trying to figure it out. Liz continues\nto drop out of the start. (groans) Trouble just\ngetting that ball to sit. -Venus giving it another go.\n-Aah! No. Falls short.\nBen struggling. \"Struggling\"\nis an understatement. Maria very close. Maria drops her first ball\nin the first target. Maria now in the lead,\nworking on that second ball. You got to untie it first. Maria with a big lead now. Can anybody catch her\nand get their first ball, make this a challenge? Here comes Venus again. Is this the time? -You're good, Venus.\n-Thank God. PROBST:\nBen has some movement\nlike he just figured it out. You're good, Ben.\nThat's how you do it! -Let's go!\n-PROBST: Ben's now in it. There's Maria working\non her second and final ball. She landed her first.\nNobody else has. Venus doing a nice job,\ndown in green. She just made up a lot of time. Getting closer and closer\nto that first target. Charlie making a move\nfor that first target. He'd like to be in this. Aw, damn. PROBST:\nMaria drops.\nMaria has to go back. The door is open for somebody\nto drop that first ball. Venus has her first ball. Venus is now in it.\nLook at that. LIZ:\nGood job, V. PROBST:\nCharlie drops his first.\nCharlie's in it now. It is now Maria with one, Charlie with one,\nVenus with one. Q getting closer\nto that first target. Q drops his first ball!\nQ's in it now. Liz drops her first ball.\nShe's in it. There's Kenzie. Can she drop? -(whoops) Here we go.\n-Kenzie drops. She's in it. (laughs) -I got it in.\n-Ben drops his first.\n-KENZIE: Yay! -Ben's in it now.\n-KENZIE: You're in it. PROBST:\nEverybody now working\non their second ball. This is a challenge\nthat is as wide open as it gets. Maria very close to the end. Venus just behind. Right now,\nit's Maria and Venus. Maria-- can she do it? -No. Maria drops\n-Oh! six inches from the end.\nGot to start again. Venus getting closer. -No!\n-PROBST: Venus drops. We are wide open again! We got a challenge. -There's another one.\n-Any one of the seven can win. Question is who will it be? Who's gonna be wearing\nthat necklace tonight? 'Cause you're earning it\nright now. Aah! -(groans)\n-Aah! Oh, my God. (groans) PROBST:\nVenus, again,\nwith a shot to win it. -No. No! Aah!\n-PROBST: No. This time, Venus drops again. So does Maria. And it's now Q in the lead. -Come on!\n-PROBST: Q drops! Open again. Look at that-- day 21,\neverybody with a shot at it. Oh. PROBST:\nWho's gonna grab it? Who wants that necklace? Me. PROBST:\nVenus in that same section,\nlast bit of track. Maria right on her tail. But it is Venus\nin the lead right now. Is this the round? Is this where somebody\ncloses it out, claims their victory\nfor this challenge, guarantees themself\na spot at six? Slightest wrong move, and that ball falls. Venus inching closer. Maria catching her. Venus-- can she do it? For the win, individual immunity, just has to drop it in that net. -No! No!\n-PROBST: And she doesn't!\n-LIZ: Wow. -She couldn't get it\nin the target.\n-What?! -PROBST: Wow!\n-So close.\n-LIZ: V! -No!\n-PROBST: Maria at the same spot\nVenus was. Can she drop it for the win? -Aah!\n-And she does!\nMaria pulls it out. Oh, my God. PROBST:\nHer second individual\nimmunity win, guaranteed a spot at six and pizza delivered to camp -on day 21. Wow.\n-LIZ: Good job, sister. -Maria!\n-PROBST: Nice job, everybody. -BEN: Congrats, Maria.\n-LIZ: Nice job, sister. (Ben whoops) Maria, come on over. (whooping)\nWay to go, Mama. -Well done.\n-BEN: Yeah! For the second time this season,\nsafe tonight at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot\nin the final six. -(whooping)\n-PROBST: You're going\nto have a fun afternoon with pizza\nbeing delivered for you. Choose one person to join you. Walk me through the thought\nprocess of strategy, compassion. You're also fueling\nyour competition. -There's a lot going on.\n-There's a lot going on. I mean, Liz has been\neating some rice. She's been sharing with Venus. Ben's been falling apart. He's completely depleted. Q took me\non the reward last time, and so I feel\nlike I need to take him. And so there's, you know...\nCharlie didn't go on the reward. It's a really hard decision.\nHow many people do I get? We'll find out.\nRight now, you got one. Okay. I think I'm gonna pick Ben. PROBST:\nCome on over, Ben. CHARLIE:\nYou go get it, buddy. (sniffles) (sniffles) (crying) This is crazy. PROBST:\nAll right,\nthere are five people left. You're gonna bring\none more person with you. Which means three of you\nwill have pizza, four will not. Walk me through\nwho you're gonna choose. Um, for me, it's more,\nlike, my mindset is more like who is physically falling apart\nright now, and it's not about competition or who I want\nto work with or whatever. It's just whose body is failing. I'll take myself\nout of it, Maria. I think there are people here\nthat need the food more than me. All right, Venus,\nLiz and Q, make your case. Um, I've lost weight. I would like to eat,\nbut it's your decision. I want you to pick\nwhoever you want, you know? I mean, I still\nhaven't pooped in three weeks, so I'd like\nsomething to get moving. You know, I ain't too proud\nto beg. (laughs) Love that song. I think whatever decision\nyou make is completely fine, Maria. You shouldn't-you shouldn't\nfeel guilty, either way. \u266a \u266a I've never seen\na moment like this, ever. -46 seasons.\nIt has never taken this long.\n-(laughs) PROBST:\nNobody's given this much\nthought. That's not a criticism. That's just an observation. Okay. Liz and Q, rock paper scissors. Pick rock. (laughs) Paper covers rock. Is that it? -Yep.\n-Q, come on over.\n-KENZIE: Wow. (quietly): Wow. PROBST:\nWe don't need\nto belabor this anymore. Tribal Council tonight. Somebody will be the 12th person\nvoted out of this game, become the fifth member\nof our jury. You're gonna go back to camp.\nMaria, Ben and Q, you're gonna have\nan afternoon with pizza. The other four, got nothing for\nyou. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council. KENZIE:\n I am shocked. Maria is like, \"Liz and Q,\nplay rock paper scissors.\" What? Liz has made it\n very abundantly clear that she's starving. If you just want to take Q because he's your number one,\n just say that. Don't be like, \"Oh, I want\n to take care of the people who haven't eaten,\" and\nthen take the guy who just ate. Makes no sense. My jaw, I'm still picking\n it up off the floor. Survivor is still going strong\nin its third decade because of the people\nwho apply to play.

Oh, my God. -Honestly, I am in shock.\n-LIZ: Correct. Correct. When she said,\n\"Venus, make your case,\" I'm like,\n\"I'm sorry. I'm not gonna beg. You know, physically,\nwhere I'm at.\" CHARLIE:\nUh, when she said,\n\"Rock paper scissors,\" I was like, \"Oh,\nit's gonna be Liz and Venus.\" -Me, too.\n-And I was like, \"Liz and who?\" I knew it was gonna be Q. KENZIE:\nI cannot believe she said,\n\"I'm just trying to judge it\non whose body's breaking down.\" -I know. And then...\n-Can I just say, I would have respected her\nso much more if she just picked who she picked, but\nthe fact that she prefaced it -by saying that and\nthen picked the most well-fed,\n-KENZIE: I know. -buffest guy.\nHe's been to, like,\nthree rewards now. -He just finished his Applebee's\nfeast, like a day ago.\n-VENUS: Yeah. Literally. He hasn't even digested it yet.\nIt's still in his stomach. CHARLIE: The pizza picking was a bit of a... for lack of a better word,\na ... show. I thought, for sure,\n Maria was gonna choose Venus or Liz, but Q ends up going. And let me tell you,\n the four pizza losers were pissed. -KENZIE: What the ...\n-VENUS: She went from being a hero to a villain real quick. To emphasize being this,\nlike, mother to all, caring about everyone. I'm so done, like, being quiet\nwhen someone ticks me off. So, what are we\ndoing tonight-- Q? He's evil and self-centered\nand selfish. -My God.\n-I know it's a game,\nbut, like, geez. The veil has been lifted. I had a feeling Maria and Q\n were working together, but now it's just blatantly\nfreaking obvious, and I cannot respect anybody who is playing the game\n with that jerk. -I mean, did you know\nthey were so close?\n-CHARLIE: I... As far as I'm concerned,\nQ's Maria's number one. -That's...\n-Q's an idiot. -(groans)\n-It's the classic Survivor \"If you can't\ngo for your target, go for their number one.\" I was just piling everything on. \"Maria's the worst. \"They're such a tight duo. I can't believe\nshe's working with him.\" But since Maria has the necklace\n tonight, the pizza losers want to vote out Q. Which is great,\n because Q is someone that I want out of the game,\n and I want him out soon. Okay, so, we don't think\nQ has an idol? -Definitely not.\n-CHARLIE: Uh... I am 97% sure. Charlie, thanks\nfor listening to me vent. -Oh.\n-I know you and Maria are close. -I'm in my feelings right now.\n-We are, -but, I mean...\n-VENUS: That's different.\nThat's game versus... Things have been turning\na different corner, you know? BEN: Damn right. -I slowed down.\n-I just want to say\nthank you so much. You're so welcome, Ben. If a look could kill... ...I got slaughtered today. (Ben chuckles) MARIA:\n Liz pierced me with her eyes. BEN:\n Mm-hmm. MARIA: I was gonna\nbe damned either way. Yeah. Yo, Liz does have rice. MARIA:\nThat's what I'm saying. That's why I was like,\nwell, what's, you know? -Yeah.\n-Kenzie just ate. Charlie's like, \"Don't take me.\" -Yeah.\n-So I'm like,\n\"Well, that's the right move.\" -Q: Mm-hmm.\n-BEN: A hundred percent. MARIA:\n I'm sure I pissed people off, but winning this challenge\n gives me peace of mind. It means that I am safe tonight, and that gives me\n a lot of power. At this point, there\n are still three Siga members. So with seven people left-- although it's\na very unpopular opinion-- I got to keep Q happy right now. Q is a number for me. He trusts me, and I trust him. They know you two are tight. -It's a little obvious\nat this point.\n-Yeah. And they know\nyou and Charlie are day-ones. MARIA:\nThe three of us. Exactly. -That's all we need.\n-That's all we need. Really. Yeah. -Q: Is that ham?\n-Yeah. -I think it's ham.\n-It's ham. Q:\n I shouldn't have\n went on that reward. I just ate a couple days ago, a big meal, and now I just ate\nabout 23 slices of pizza. (laughs) It ain't fair. But I don't feel guilty\n at all, because I get to now make sure\nthat I'm not going home tonight. I say Siga three, plus me, -take out Venus first, because\n-MARIA: Yeah. Yeah. Liz is less likely\nto win immunity than Venus. -BEN: Yeah.\n-MARIA: Right, right. -Yeah.\n-Venus came super close today. -I know. I thought she had it.\n-But... MARIA:\nI say it's time to get her out. Q:\n Venus is the real problem with all the complaining, and the pushy and the running and telling\nthis story to this person. And, also, she has the greatest\n shot at winning immunity, as we saw in this challenge. She is a problem. So she needs to go. The negative vibes\nhave been a bit much. MARIA:\nYeah. Any chance Venus found the idol? No. MARIA:\nIt's time to get her out. I'm ready. Yeah. Ug h, w he n is m y al le rg y sp ra y go in g to k ic k in ? -You need Astepro.\n-Astepro?

LIZ:\nBen, feeling better?\nDid you get a slice down? -Yes.\n-I got-I got a slice down. -What was the best flavor?\n-LIZ: That was so fast. I feel like a Ninja Turtle\nright now. -Dude.\n-I'm not gonna undersell it. CHARLIE:\n The pizza winners\n come back to camp, and we do our classic niceties. \"How much did you eat?\n Was it delicious? Oh, tell us all about it.\n I'm so glad.\" Even though, seconds before they arrived, man, I thought that the people\nat camp were gonna eat them. It was tense. I'm happy with Maria's\n choices for me, but it really put the heat\non her and Q. I know they probably been\npitching me this whole time. -Yep.\n-Just got to let them know -that's not happening, so\nthey don't write my name down.\n-Okay. Yep. -In case V pulls out\nan idol, but...\n-Okay. the real plan is Venus. Okay. Okay. At this point in the game, I want the burners turned up\n on everyone but me. So if I can hide this vote\nwhen I don't have the necklace, and all of a sudden, everyone's\neyes are on Q and Maria, this is great. I mean, I did. I just... I feel really bad, and I'm not really sure\nhow to talk about it. Honestly, Maria,\nit was really weird. -We were all like, \"Wow.\"\n-MARIA: I know. There's no way\nto win that situation. And I told myself,\n\"I never want to win reward because I don't want\nto have to make that choice.\" And I knew I was gonna\npiss people off and I just, I apologize\nif I hurt anybody's feelings. There was just, there was no way to make\neveryone happy in that choice. Oh, I completely\nagree with that. I just can't stand Q,\nand I just don't know why you would\nwant to make him happy. 'Cause he's\nsuch an ass to everyone. He does nothing around camp. He used all the firewood in,\nlike, two hours. I'm done not expressing myself. MARIA:\nOkay. Yeah, go for it. LIZ:\nThat is my mindset, Maria. I guess that's what\nI've learned in Survivor, is, like,\nI've spent my whole life just letting myself be angry\nand not speaking what I'm really feeling for the sake\nof someone else's feelings. And I think, honestly--\nthis sounds crazy-- I think that's why\nI have so many ... allergies, because\nI've suppressed my own self for so long that my body\nstarted attacking things. So I've said my piece. I feel better.\nThank you for hearing me. Normally, I'm not someone\n who holds grudges, but with Q, it just feels\na little more personal. For some reason,\n he just keeps surviving. And I'm getting more and more and more and more\nand more and more irritated. MARIA:\n I felt like I hurt you,\nand I didn't like how that felt. I was just shocked about Q,\nbecause I'm like, \"He's a jerk.\" -So...\n-The thing is, Liz,\nis that, like, the only people\nthat are talking to me are Siga people and Q. That's it. -You know?\n-I feel like the only person\ntalking to me is Venus. And I don't believe\nanything she says. She's so all over the place. MARIA:\nWell, that's another reason\nwhy I can't work with her. I can't understand\nher game at all. Ditto. And so I guess\nthat's why I come to you, because it's like... I liked working with you\nfor Tevin. I liked working with you\nfor Tiff. I like the fact that you said, \"I'm here to play the game.\nI want to play the game.\" But, like, let's play the game. Right now,\n having not had a chance to talk to everybody,\nit seems like the ladies want Q out, and Q, Ben and I have\ndiscussed getting Venus out. And so, Venus and Q are\n gonna be the targets tonight. It's my hope\n that Venus goes home, but, you know, you never know. Like, as the sun starts\n to go down, sometimes things change and people scramble,\n and then a new plan comes out. In my mind, the people\nI'm working with are solid, but I guess that's\na silly assumption. \u266a \u266a Yeah, I know. I'm, like... -I know. I know.\n-Okay. Are you and Ben doing Q? I don't know about Ben. KENZIE:\n Well, Ben can do\n whatever Ben wants, but, like, -if you're gonna write Q,\nwe're good.\n-Yeah. It doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. If an idol comes into play\nat six, and Q gets it and Maria wins immunity,\nthen we're screwed. -Yeah.\n-Like, we'd be so dumb\nto not get rid of him -right now.\n-Yeah, I know. -We've got to do Q.\n-I know. I don't think Q's a bad person. I don't think Q's evil, but... I'm fine with\nother people thinking that, because, ultimately,\n down the line, I want a final four that doesn't\nhave Q or Maria in it. What is your ideal final four? -Final four?\n-Yeah. 'Cause, frankly,\nwe got to think about it. I've been thinking about that. 'Cause a four at six\ncontrols the vote. VENUS:\n Charlie's in a power position. He's kingpin right now. And based off of discussions from today\nand previous to today, just based off\nof my relationship with Charlie as a whole, I think that\n Charlie really understands trust goes both ways. And if he sticks to the Q vote tonight, I'm gonna give him\nsomething in return next time. Can I tell you,\nI've got your back. -And I've got...\n-I've got yours, too. I've got\nsome things up my sleeve. -I feel like we'll be fine.\n-What does that mean? You don't have\nto worry about it now, -but I feel like in terms of...\n-I am worried about it. No, you don't\nhave to worry about it. I'm saying us,\nfinal four, is locked in. For tonight's vote, sure, I have an easy out.\nI can just play my idol. \"Oh, there's a risk of me\ngoing home. I can play it.\" But that's not what\n wins the game for you. It's about using it correctly\n or not using it at all because your social game\n is that good. And so, even though\nI have a guaranteed way of going into\ntonight's Tribal stress-free, I don't even care. I don't want to use it because, for me, if I get this correct and I get to save the idol\n for another vote, then that just\nspeaks to more of why I deserve to win this game\nin the end. We'll make it to final four. No. Okay. That's why I was... That seemed like\nthings up your sleeve. Or maybe I do. (gasps) -Who knows? No, I don't. But...\n-Oh, Venus. We-we will be close\nafter this vote. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay?\n-Yeah. Venus alluded to someone-- maybe her-- having something\nup their sleeve, as an advantage or some sort of extra spice that could\n shake things up around here. And I was trying to get Venus\nto tell me what the heck it was, but she kept being very cagey about it. In terms of idol,\nI really don't think Q has it. I don't think anyone has it,\nunless you do. -Unless it's up your sleeve.\n-No. (chuckles) No, no, no. -There's something else\nup my sleeve.\n-You're being all shifty. -No, I...\n-What else is up your sleeve? There's something else\nthat's going on that I'll tell you about later,\nbut it's not an idol. And that's why I'm so adamant to\nfind this idol, too, by the way. Yeah. I'm curious why\nyou're not telling me now. -Because I want Q out for sure.\n-Okay. And as soon as Q is out, we can have an open discussion -Yeah.\n-about everything that will\nguarantee us final four. -Okay. All right. No, no.\n-And that's like, that's like... -I trust you. I trust you.\n-Handshake.\nNo, handshake promise. -I trust you.\n-Okay. CHARLIE:\n I'm trying to set up\n a final four deal with Venus, and she's stonewalling me on\nsomething incredibly important. That, to me, is a red flag. So I've just got to think\nabout how to play this in a way that it doesn't sink my game. V talked to me,\n and she was like, \"I'm totally cool going\nto the final four with you -and Ben and one other.\"\n-Of course. -'Cause she's a poser.\n-Yeah. The other thing that V said is that she alluded to some advantage that somebody has. So it would either be her,\nLiz or Kenzie who has it. BEN:\nShe's saying whatever\nshe can to get out of tonight. \"I want to get Q out.\" -Yeah.\n-V has got to go. Q is a heavy target\n we got to get out of the game, but at the same time,\n Venus also does have to go. My reason for Venus\nhaving to go has nothing to do with her being a threat. She's just creating more\n and more chaos. She freaks out\n before every Tribal, and she's always running around\ntrying to pitch some crazy plan, and I'm sick\n of being around that. So I'd rather get her out first\nbefore we get out anybody else. CHARLIE:\n My head is going in 22 different directions. It's being\npulled every which way, and I just have\nto hope that I can figure out what's best for my game. But right now,\nit's a big old storm cloud. KENZIE: Okay. CHARLIE:\n...and they're gonna play it. -Venus is chaos. I don't\nwant Venus here, either...\n-Yeah. I trust what you want to do. Okay. So whatever-whatever... KENZIE:\n I think that\n the boys are being babies and don't want\n to make a big move because they want\n to feel secure. Because if they get rid of Q, then they're more vulnerable. But I'm like,\n\"If I get rid of Venus, then I'm more vulnerable.\" I just think it's foolish\nto not take out the biggest threat in the game\nwhile they're vulnerable. CHARLIE:\n The middle is a safe place\n to be and a dangerous place to be. It's a double-edged sword\nand, frankly, it's a sword that has\na point also pointing at you. -I know.\nI didn't know where you were.\n-I was like... Even though\nI might have power tonight, I could make a mistake that\nsinks my game moving forward. So it's Venus, right? Is that what you're hearing? Yeah. The way people are\n talking about Q and Maria, working with them\ncould taint my image. Right now, I know\n I'm a little bit of a threat, but people are not mad at me. After tonight's vote,\n my main concern is can I pull people\n that I've burned back into a position\n that benefits me? And I don't know\n if I can do that if I burn people\n who are so dead set on getting Q out tonight. It might be the last straw,\n and I might be public enemy number one\n for stringing them along. So it's really, really tricky\n where I am right now. -O h, h er e co me s th e br ea d gu y. -C om e on . If you save nearly\n$750 like this, imagine what we could get.

What up, Ben?\nSomebody had some pizza. (chuckles) \u266a \u266a All right. So I brought popcorn\na couple of Tribals ago because I was expecting something fun,\nso I did bring the cushion. MARIA:\nAll right. And tonight,\nI didn't have popcorn, so I brought some licorice. -Damn!\n-(others exclaiming) Oh. So I am really... LIZ:\nOh, my God. -...ready to go tonight.\n-(laughing) -VENUS: Jeff...\n-BEN: Jeff, that's foul. PROBST:\nBut look, I can't\ngive you the whole thing because people go,\n\"What has happened to Probst? He's giving them food.\" But I don't want\nto be a bad host. I really like licorice when I'm\nwatching my favorite show, so... I'll give you one. -You got to figure out\nwhat you do with it.\n-(groaning) -This is Survivor. -VENUS: Oh, my God. Cool. BEN: Of course\nyou put me on the spot. I'm breaking it even. Let's go. -Everybody gets a piece.\n-VENUS: No. -Thank you.\n-KENZIE: Thank you. All right. -CHARLIE: A new taste\nthat's not coconut.\n-Thanks, Jeff. -Thanks, Jeff.\n-CHARLIE: That's pretty good. I can eat licorice. KENZIE:\nYeah. Thank you. All right, so, let's start with one of\nthe craziest challenges. At any given point, any one\nof you could have won it. Maria, you win,\nand you get to bring two people. It's the longest time we've ever spent\ndeciding who to bring. So how did that go? The first decision\nfor me was really easy, but then you have\nto start weighing, like, am I fueling my competition? Am I fueling my alliance? Am I feeding people\nwho are malnourished? Like, how do I\nmake this decision? And I had to give Q a chance and I wanted\nto give Liz a chance. And I said,\n\"Let's rock paper scissors, 'cause I can't\nmake this choice.\" Venus, you were clearly upset\nthat you weren't chosen. VENUS:\nIt's one thing to decide\nwho you're gonna take with on a reward,\nbut to start off by saying, \"You know,\nI really want to choose someone \"who is physically weak and really needs\nthis reward, health-wise,\" and then put on this farce to ultimately choose the most\nwell-fed, fittest guy here-- it kind of felt like\na punch in the gut. -It kind of felt cruel,\nyou know?\n-An act and a farce is... that's, to me, like daggers. That was the hardest decision\nI had to make today. So if she\ncan stand there and say, \"That was an act and that was\na farce,\" I'd love for her to take that spot\nand make the decision herself. I wouldn't\nhave prefaced the decision with that kind of comment. I would have just\nmade my decision and just been content with it. But, Jeff, if Venus\nwould have won the reward, she wouldn't have taken... -No way. (laughs) No way.\n-Q: ...uh, Maria. She wouldn't have taken me.\nYou know what I'm saying? -We'll never know.\n-Q: So... Uh, we know. -Trust me. Okay.\n-We don't know. You can't sit there and say,\n\"Well, Venus never would have picked me,\"\n'cause you don't know. So... You wouldn't have. And that's a fact. Wow. Charlie, what's your take? CHARLIE:\nSo, I think the big theme\nof this pizza reward is really \"decisions.\" And no decision in Survivor weighs as much as who we are voting out at any given Tribal Council. So, you're thinking about who are you putting on the jury? Who are you leaving in the game\nto work with you? And at this point in the game,\nwho am I going to sit next to at the end and have\nthe jury judge me against? Everything has consequences, and it makes this game just incredibly, incredibly hard. PROBST:\nKenzie, let's\ntalk about blindsides. When you're the architect\nof a blindside, it's great. And yet you can't tell people because there are idols,\nthere are advantages. Tonight's the last night\nyou can use Shot in the Dark. Does that get\nmore and more pressurized as the days\nget closer to the end? It's extremely pressurized. I mean, I got bamboozled\nby a blindside last time, and it wasn't even me. So when it's getting down\nto just seven, and everybody's telling you all these\ndifferent things, it's, like, so layered and weighted,\nand you just have to put your faith in these people who\nhave literally blindsided you, even if it's not\nyour name written down. It's very jarring. Liz, it's really interesting\nto hear Kenzie say that. That you get blindsided,\nand then you might actually have to work\nwith the people who lied to you. Amen. I've been incredibly vocal. (laughs) I don't know how else to say it.\nAnd I'm just... About what? (groans) -Okay, one more time.\nOne more time.\n-LIZ: Sure. (groans) (sputters) -I'm just feeling...\n-Okay. You've been\nvery vocal about what? About Q.\nI mean, come on.\nI-I feel like I... (groans) Like... Everybody's talking about,\n\"Oh, I want to make a big move. Let's blindside.\nLet's do this.\" I feel like I can't\ntrust anyone right now. It's like... Yeah, the-the Q and Liz\nrock paper scissors. And it was like,\nokay, in my head, Maria wants to play\nwith Q more than I thought. I don't know. It's... bleh. PROBST:\nQ, did you hear your name\nin the same way you have for the past few Tribals? Q:\nOh, yeah. I heard my name today. But, again, Jeff,\nI approach the situation the same every time. You tell me something.\nI tell you something. We agree. If I believe it, I'm going on about my way. If it's a lie, you will\nput my fire out tonight. That's how I go.\nI'm not gonna worry about it. But, you know, with the people that I've talked to, it seem like everybody's\non the same page. I don't know\nif that page is my page or someone else's page. I guess we'll find out. Venus, how would\nyou describe camp today? Today was a bit different,\nbecause up until the last vote, I've been in on what was\ngonna happen, and like Kenzie, I was on the wrong side\nof the vote for Tiff. So, although I felt like\nI could trust everyone before, now it's like I don't know\nwho's telling me the truth, who's lying, which way\nthe vote's gonna go. 'Cause people just\nlove writing my name down. Oh, my name is out there,\nas well, Jeff. But to be fair, everybody here knows to never, ever, ever, -ever, ever, ever, ever\n-VENUS: And yet he did. -say a name in front of Venus.\n-And yet he did. Why is that, Q?\nWhy do you think... Because what Venus will do is she'll come\nup to you aggressively. -Never.\n-\"What do you want to do?\" You tell her a name,\nthis is what she's gonna do. -Run and tell this person.\n-Straight-up... \"Oh, Liz said this.\"\nThis person. -\"Q said this.\" This person...\n-With Q, specifically, Jeff, -I made sure\nnot to talk strategy.\n-No one talks game with her. -I'm done talking about it.\n-VENUS: I would never\nin a million years try and talk strategy\nwith this man voluntarily. And that's a fact. And last vote\nproved that exactly, -with what happened to Tiff.\n-Q: That's why you didn't\nknow about the last vote. 'Cause they didn't trust you. Mm-hmm, but I knew\nabout the previous three, and you didn't, so... -Ooh.\n-(exclaims) -PROBST: Ben...\n-(chuckles) ...every Tribal,\nwhile entertaining, has been complicated. I don't think I've seen the cynicism and paranoia be played up to 11 the way it's been\nthe last few days. This is a prime example that some people are just\nnot gonna be on the same page. It's about making\nit through the next vote, because one crew that will\ndo one vote together is probably\nnot gonna be a crew that'll do\na second vote together. And it's\nbeen this constant shift since the beginning\nof the merge. PROBST:\nSo then, Charlie,\nwhat do you do? Sooner or later\nyou have to walk up those steps and write down a name. What is the final decider?\nWhat do you go to? CHARLIE:\nEven if you can't\ntrust someone, can you somehow point yourselves\nin the same direction? You know, set up\nyour row of dominoes all in a line and make sure that they all tip over and send the right person home\nfor your individual game. So, you have to be\nable to persuade people to point in the same direction. And I think that's\nwhat tonight's about. All right.\nIt is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. \u266a \u266a Please get off the island. I'm sick of all your lies. \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right.\nI'll read the votes. First vote: Q. Venus. Kenzie. So, that's one vote Kenzie, one vote Q, one vote Venus. Venus. Two votes Venus,\none vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Venus. That's three votes Venus,\none vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Twelfth person voted out and the fifth member\nof our jury: Venus. That's four. That's enough.\nNeed to bring me your torch. -VENUS: Great job, you guys.\n-Love you, boo. Love you. Great game, sister. Venus, the tribe has spoken. -Great game, you guys.\n-Time for you to go. -VENUS: You killed it.\n-Bye, V. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night.

Babe, if you're watching this, I am not in a relationship\n with Sierra on Survivor. PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... SUE:\n Kyle wanted me out. I am gonna get revenge. ROME:\n\"Congratulations.\" This is exactly\nwhat I needed, baby. I feel like\nI'm running this game right now. TEENY:\n I feel a close\npersonal connection with Aysha. But if Aysha won't work with me, is it worth\n keeping her in this game? If anybody has an advantage or an idol\nand you want to play it... One second, Jeff. I was able to get an idol that's good\nfor one Tribal Council, so I'm gonna use it now. First vote: Sol. Third person voted out\nof Survivor 47: Aysha. The tribe has spoken. \u266a \u266a TEENY:\n Sol... Yes? TEENY:\nYou got anything to say\nright off the bat? I'm glad I'm still here, but, uh, yeah,\nI mean, you guys got me. Well played. At Tribal Council tonight, my ass got blindsided. And the people who I thought\n were my allies, Kish and Teeny, they went against\nwhat I thought was gonna happen. And Rome is still here. That's what\n I'm more upset about. We know who Rome is.\nWe know what kind of guy he is. -ROME: I know you voted for me.\n-Yep. And, uh... It was part of the plan--\nwhat I thought was the plan. And you voted for me? No. -SOL: Who voted for me?\n-We'll talk. SOL:\n I'm at the bottom of my tribe. I have to quickly get over it,\nand I have to get my mind right. Otherwise, I'm going home. -I just want to say I'm sorry...\n-Okay. ...because I voted for you,\nand I need to explain that. -You voted for me?\n-Yes. Okay. And I know that goes against\nevery promise I made to you, and I understand\nif you're pissed. I'd love to claim\n the vote for Sol as purely this mastermind strategic plan,\nbut that's not entirely true. I could not fathom\n writing Aysha's name down because of\n my emotional bond with her. You know, this isn't a moment where I'm like, \"Yes,\nwe just nailed a blindside.\" It's a moment where I am upset. I-I think that's gonna haunt me. I think that's gonna be, like... This is a game. And if the people playing\nthe game can't handle that, that's on them. It's not on you. -Okay?\n-I know, but, like, am I the person\nwho can't handle it is really... You're gonna be able to... I wanted to come out here\nand be this villainous mastermind player\nwho was able to make decisions based purely off\nhow I could advance in the game. But at the same time,\n I know myself. I'm sensitive. And that's something that\nI just have to learn to balance as I move forward in this game. No. That's why I was very-- I was,\nlike, I thought it was you. ROME:\nI feel like\nwe all played that perfectly. And now we have\nthe majority alliance. We got a solidified alliance. Like, we're,\nwe're ready to roll. (chuckles) Tonight, Tribal Council went\nexactly how I wanted it to go. Aysha went home. -Sol messed up,\nand he knows he's on the bottom. -(sighs) And Rome ended up prevailing,\nbaby. We all made it\nthrough our first Tribal. -KISHAN: Yeah.\n-ROME: Mm-hmm. -That's huge.\n-ROME: Mm-hmm. KISHAN:\nYeah. Which, like... GENEVIEVE:\nOh, my God. Yeah. This Survivor game is going perfectly for me\nup to this point. I feel like\n I'm in control all the way. So if we got to go\n back to Tribal Council again, I am 110% confident\n it's gonna be Sol. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a SAM: \u266a Yeah, off the top, and\n you know the bars are silly \u266a \u266a Comin' for the money \u266a \u266a And I'm about\n to make a milli on Survivor \u266a \u266a Yeah, with the Gata \u266a \u266a Yeah, you know,\nI'm coming so hot and I wanna \u266a \u266a And I hope you listening \u266a \u266a Got to clean it up\n like I got some Listerine \u266a \u266a I come hard,\n everybody know it \u266a \u266a When I come through,\n I don't even show it \u266a \u266a 'Cause we go to the challenge,\n and you know we gonna win \u266a \u266a Again and again \u266a \u266a And Jeff says, \"Get it on\" \u266a \u266a We gon' get it on \u266a \u266a Everybody knows\n when we do that this was on. \u266a Ah, damn. That was a bad one. -That was a bad one...\n-No, that was so good! SAM:\n Freestyling,\n going with the flow is kind of\n how I'm playing Survivor. And right now Sierra is my number one. The two of us\n are sitting in the middle. So if we go to Tribal Council, we can stick\n with Anika and Rachel or pick up Andy,\nand we still have the majority. So we're in the know\nand in the middle and in the driver's seat. -You feeling okay?\n-I'm feeling good. All right, good. Yeah. No. I don't think it's a big factor. -I don't think...\n-And I don't think, I don't think\nit was something Ani needed to come back and, like, plot into our heads, too, but... we need to make sure\n we clear that air. For sure. Because that will change\nmy whole game. When Anika\n came back from the journey, she said\nthe other tribes are picking up that Sam and I\nare working together. We're not dating,\nbut we are working together. And what\nis giving them that vibe? I'm not sure. You've spent so much alone time\nwith Ani and Rachel, -it's, like, equal. Like,\nwhy is it that we're dating?\n-I know, I know. -Why couldn't you be\ndating Ani or Rachel?\n-Ani says it's aesthetic. -She said,\nit's Ken and Barbie, and...\n-Ken and Barbie? Get out of here. Whatever. I'm not even\n gonna let it get in my head. But I think, moving forward in the game,\nI don't want them to know that Sam and I\n are this tight alliance. So I'm gonna make sure\n Anika and Rachel know that I want to work with them and make sure\nthat line is, like, clear. (chuckles) Oh, are we alone? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. What do you--\nHow do you like, uh... What did I say?\nThe... the Breadwinners. Oh, oh, oh, the Breadwinners. The Breadwinners? Yes. Yes. -We are. We're the Breadwinners.\n-Right? -And we're gonna win that bread.\n-(squeals) ANIKA: When it comes\n to camp life and challenges, the three girls here\nhave truly been the powerhouses of this tribe. And so we call ourselves\n the Breadwinner alliance. We have a very, like... ...relationship. SIERRA:\nI just want to make sure,\nat least going into everything, it's us three. -100%.\n-Oh, my God. Dude. Sierra. -Let them see.\n-Look me in the eye.\nLook me in the eye. -Absolutely.\n-RACHEL: Yes.\n-Okay. RACHEL:\n Having a strong alliance\n of women is incredible. Anika has been\n my number one since day one. And then also having Sierra,\nwho I also really trust at this point,\n is amazing for me. Breadwinners. -Breadwinners?\n-(chuckles) I feel good. I feel like my game's\ngoing as well as I could hope it could be going right now. \u266a \u266a TIYANA:\nSue? -(Sue exhales sharply)\n-TIYANA: You okay?\nWhat happened? Just feeling emotional.\n(exhales sharply) (sniffles) I just, um... I'm feeling like\nI'm tired, you know? Like, when I get tired,\nI just get emotional. (exhales sharply, sniffles) (chuckles):\nI don't want to be crying on TV. Join the club. I already did. Had myself a little cry -earlier this morning.\n-SUE: You did? Yep. Once you accept\nthat it's part of the process, it's a little bit easier\nto let out. Before I even\n came into this game, my number one target for an ally\nwas gonna be an older woman,\n preferably a mother. I wanted to play with a Sue, and the island fortune\nbrought me a Sue. -Feeling a little better?\n-Yeah. -Give me a hug.\n-Thank you. -You know I got you, right?\n-I know you do. Thank you. GABE:\n I think she's somebody\n who really wears her heart on her sleeve, but\n she also tells me everything. -I'll protect you.\n-Yeah, and I'll protect you. -100%.\n-Yeah. GABE:\n Sue has given me every piece of knowledge\nthat she has in this game, so I'm very confident in\nmy alliance with Sue right now. -KYLE: You should be\nproud of yourself.\n-SUE: Thank you. Yeah, I know. I know. I cannot wait. -Yeah.\n-Yeah, true. SUE:\n Right now, people see me\n as a mom. I'm a grandma. 100%, they're underestimating me because I am\nthe older generation, but I'm hiding\n a lot from my tribe. They have no clue\n that I'm 58 years old. -KYLE: Damn. Really?\n-Yeah. Like, that's awesome. That, like...\nIf the good Lord's willing, that leaves a lot of time. I don't need to be wheelchaired\naround or need a cane or need... -No.\n-You know,\nI can just do it all, so... They have no idea\n that I am a badass pilot, and I'm an adrenaline junkie always looking for a rush. I'm here for the journey.\nI'm here for the thrill of it. And this is exciting because\n nobody would ever suspect that I've been spending my time\n secretly looking for an idol. I want that power.\nI want that protection. I want the thrill\n of finding an idol. Ah. Oh. No way. It is\n a freaking Beware Advantage. I couldn't open\nthat packet fast enough. The map was giving me\n very specific instructions. Now I got to get this. But if I don't find\nthat palm tree and get my idol, I don't vote. So it's behind the water well. Going that direction. The rope was hidden in vines. But now that I knew\n what I was looking for, that rope stood out\n like a sore thumb. \u266a \u266a A bucket fractures, and paint just bursts\nall over the place. And I see the idol there. I have no idea\n what I'm gonna do. Obviously, I don't want\n to get caught red-handed. This is crazy. It is horrifying\n to see all of this paint. It looks like\n blood splattered everywhere. And I need to cover my tracks because I don't want anybody\nknowing that I have an idol. \u266a \u266a It is literally\n like a crime scene, that I was the murderer, and now I'm trying to cover my tracks. I'm so desperate\nto get rid of all the evidence, knowing that the police\n are coming any second. I've got to cover up everything so that nobody knows it's me. I have paint on my legs.\n It's on the water well. And then, on top of that,\n the trees had paint on them. It's just out of control. I'm gonna kill Jeff\nfor making this so hard. It's taking me forever, but I slowly see progress. And finally,\n I got rid of all the evidence. Not one person will ever,\n ever know I have a hidden immunity idol. I pulled it off. I pulled it off. Hey. How was your walk? Yeah, I'm just chilling. No, I'm good. I'm good. I just wanted to chill\nfor a little while and just... -CAROLINE: Of course.\n-I don't know. Is your chin okay? Yeah. Did you fall? -I was playing with the machete.\nI'm good.\n-(gasps) I just, it's okay. TIYANA:\nIs that blood in your hair? I'm okay. I didn't cut myself. I-I just did something stupid. I'm fine. TIYANA:\n Caroline and I\n found Sue with the machete. There is blood all over\nher hands and all over her face. Immediately,\nmy red flag was raised because I was\nkind of confused as to what she could have possibly done. SUE:\nI'm fine, but I just... I have to clean up.\nI'm a little mess. (laughs) -CAROLINE: That's okay.\n-But I'll talk\nto you guys later. Take your time. We'll probably -be down at the beach,\nuh, crabbing.\n-Okay. -Okay. Thank you.\n-TIYANA: Yeah. Oh, my God.

Usually,\n that idol gets replaced. -TEENY: This is tough.\n-Yeah. You know, I know that\n I'm probably the best one at looking for idols\non my tribe, which is a comforting thing, but everyone right now\n is looking for idols. No. ROME:\n Sol is looking hard\n for this idol, and that is very scary. We want to make sure that, no matter what, Sol cannot find this idol.\nAnyone but Sol. Anyone but Sol. If you're gonna\nkeep looking for one, that's... Yeah, that's more\nof a threat than someone just sitting back at camp\ntrying to be kumbaya. Really, dude? I know what he's doing. He wants to vote me out,\nand he's trying to prevent me from searching for idols\nso I don't get one. And he's threatening me\n to do that. I'm just saying,\nthere's a time to do it and there's a time not to. And, like,\nthe people at the top, they kind of have\nthat freedom to do it. But, like, I don't know\nwhy you would just increase the target on your back. SOL:\n He's, like,\n ten years younger than me, and he's talking to me\n like I'm a kid. What the hell? What? What's happening right now? And again, I got to go Zen. (imitates chant) \"Sol, relax.\" ROME:\n I don't want him\n looking for an idol at all. That's gonna be a problem. We're fine\nif he doesn't find it. -ROME: Yeah.\n-Which, at this moment,\nhe hasn't. Sol and Rome\n are on opposite planets, and that is a positive for me. I'm not here to play safe.\nI'm here to create some chaos, which is why I've been pushing\n for them to continue clashing, so they will not work\n with each other. I think my strength\n is getting to know people, really understanding them, and then being able\nto beautifully manipulate them. I've never been\na babysitter before. Really? -ROME: No.\n-That was my first job. Hey, we're going\nlooking for an idol, guys, if you guys want to come. I'm just going\nto refill my water. \u266a \u266a I am now going\nto go get coconut after this. With Rome, it's either his way or \"I'm gonna pout\n like a five-year-old\" way. He's gonna throw\n the biggest tantrum. I ain't trying to deal\nwith that all day long. 'Cause it's exhausting\nand it's messing my game up. Could I have\na minute alone, please? -No. It's Survivor. I don't have to.\n-Seriously? I'm-a follow you around. Now, can I, can I sit over there\nby the beach alone? -Like...\n-I'm-a sit right next to you.\nThat's fine. All right. Whatever. TEENY:\n It is about as awkward\n as awkward can be. I know that Rome is just trying\n to protect our four, but, like,\n he just plays the game at an intensity level\nthat is not a match with my own. He's not looking\nfor anything right now. And he's devoid\n of any sort of concept of what Sol might be feeling as one, a player, and two, you know, a grown man, a human being on this Earth. It's just a lot. So much. Oh, I'm sorry, Sol. It's all good. That's really not how I,\npersonally, want to play. -You're not out.\n-All right. -They can knock you down,\nbut they can't get you out.\n-Right. Yeah. Of course I feel bad for Sol. Rome is being rude,\n and, you know, Rome and I have a really good\nrelationship and are very close, but it's also\n a complicated relationship for me to navigate because he's such a big personality\nand does rub people the wrong way. I think each\nof our mistakes was getting a little too locked in with what\nwe thought dynamics were -and not being\nfluid enough, you know?\n-Yes. Absolutely. Please don't tell Rome\nI'm saying this. You and I, if you allow it, -we are allies moving forward.\n-I know. Yeah, yeah. -No, no, no, no, no.\nI'm dead serious. Yeah.\n-I'm cool. I'm down. I'm down. I'm actually getting\nreally excited right now. GENEVIEVE:\n Sol is on the outs\n and is a free agent. And I want to really\n nurture that relationship, because Rome has ruffled all\n these feathers that it's like, I can only\n make the case for Rome so many times before it ends up\nbeing a case against me. \u266a \u266a What? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. RACHEL:\nMight be Andy's. I feel like\nhis bag's always open. Yeah, it's definitely\nAndy's Shot in the Dark. Oh, my God. Andy, why are you so sloppy? -SAM: Yeah, just put it\nback where it was.\n-RACHEL: Just drop it. -Just drop it\nwhere it was. Yeah.\n-SAM: Just drop it. Yeah. Sure enough, Andy-- the one guy who might\nneed his Shot in the Dark-- somehow allowed it\nto just fumble out of his bag. Your Shot in the Dark\nfell out of your bag. It's sitting on the sand,\nunder the shelter right now. You're gonna have\nto go into camp and get it. -Yeah.\n-But also, like, make a scene. Right now I'm a little bit of a mentor to Andy's game. I'm just showing him\n how to play subtle Survivor. Do you mind if I nap? No, go for it. SAM:\n He just needs\n a little guidance is all. I think\n we're still working on it. Big work in progress, but... he's a bit of\na clumsy player at times. All right, all right, all right. Andy's kind of\nlike Survivor George Costanza. He can't get out of his own way. I just tore my underwear. (gasps) On, like, a... Oh, my God. Yeah.\nIt's, like, gaping right now. SAM:\n Everything Andy does... Whoo! ...he should do\n the exact opposite of whatever he thinks\n is the right thing to do. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm always\n one step ahead of him and that he's always coming\nback to me with the information. As long as\nhe's doing that, like, Andy can stay around,\nin my book. -Two minutes ago...\n-Yeah? ...I looked in my bag, and...\n(laughs) ...the Shot in the Dark\nwas gone again, and I looked everywhere, and it\nwas just on the ground at camp. -Dude.\n-I'm like, \"What?\" -So I put it in my sock\nfrom here on out. (chuckles)\n-Okay. -I'm like,\n\"Don't make me have to...\"\n-Don't worry. Don't worry. Andy is such a sloppy player. I'm like, \"Do I really\nwant to move forward with that?\" I know that Sam\n wants to work with him, but I'm still up in the air, and it's driving me\nfreaking nuts. I just feel like Ani and Rachel\nare definitely, like, tight. -You know,\nI feel like we're a three.\n-Mm-hmm. Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n-But I feel like they're a two,\nand... -Yeah, they get pretty specific.\n-Yeah. Like, you know,\nthey call-- they have a name. Like, we're\nnow the Breadwinners. -The Breadwinners.\n-Don't say that. Um, but, you know, so, yeah, there is, like,\na deep connection. ANDY:\n I made a point and made a mission to build\na real good bond with Sierra, and it's coming on strong. Whenever I talk to you,\nI just... You feel better? I could cry.\nLike, I just love you. Oh, good.\nI know. I love you guys. I love everybody, you know? Because she gave me\nthat Breadwinners name, I know she's with me, because I know she's throwing\nthat alliance under the bus. She's throwing it away. And I believe,\n truly, that she's down to work with myself and Sam. I feel like I can tell you\neverything Sierra tells me. -Yeah.\n-So, and it's very good. I had\nthe most amazing conversation with her this morning. She said not to say it\n to anyone. I asked her how specific\n that these other women get about,\nlike, what, their alliance. She's like,\n\"Oh, they get specific. We're called the Breadwinners.\" -That's what they call it?\n-Yeah. If she's\ntelling us the name, then... -we win.\n-Wow. The Breadwinners.\n I haven't heard that before. Sierra and I,\n we're supposed to be riding for each other,\n no matter what. Why are you not coming to me\nwith that kind of information? -You're my number one, so\nI'm gonna tell you everything.\n-Yeah. Andy tells me\nthat you told him about a... alliance name\nthat the three girls have. -Rachel said that she's\ncalling us the Breadwinners.\n-Right. -I didn't come up with it.\n-I don't care. -That's, like...\n-I didn't come up with it. You know that\nthat's not where I'm going. -You know I have to play it off.\n-I know, but if, you know,\nif, like... -Okay.\n-No, but why didn't\nyou tell me that stuff? SIERRA:\n I didn't say, \"Hey, girls, let's\nbe called the Breadwinners.\" I didn't come up with that. I'm going along with it because I'm doing what\n I think is best for my game. Andy, right now, is... He-he scares me. I don't... Why? I don't think\nAndy's gonna be loyal to me. But we don't\nhave to go with Andy yet. If-if we're at four, we can\nalways go with one of the girls. I don't know if that's\nwhat makes sense for me either. SAM:\n Sierra thinks Andy needs to go at the next\nTribal Council, and, uh, that ain't gonna work for me. Keeping Andy is absolutely essential to my game. I don't see a world\nwhere it's the four of us, and the two of them\naren't wanting to get me out. Yeah, but that's not\ngonna happen because of me. Sam and I are just completely\n bumping heads right now. We might need Survivor's alliance therapy at this point because we're just going\n back and forth, and I'm like, \"This is too early in the game to be bickering like\na freaking old married couple.\" \u266a \u266a Th e fi rs t ti me y ou t ry Bo un ce , it h it s yo u.

Aysha voted out... -CAROLINE: Wow.\n-Oh. ...at the last Tribal Council. GABE:\nWell, well, well. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -(all assent)\n-All right. First things first,\ngot to take back the idols. Thank you. -Thank you.\n-Yes, sir. \u266a \u266a Once again,\nimmunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're\n gonna roll a heavy metal cube to help you retrieve two bags. You'll use\n the pieces inside the bags to build a window frame\n and then attempt to toss sandbags through the frame,\n onto a barrel. If you knock the frame over, you got to rebuild it\n and try again. Once you've\n landed your sandbags, you'll then dig up a key,\n open a gate. That'll get you to the finish, where two tribe members\n will work together to build a brand-new Survivor fire puzzle. (excited chatter) First two tribes to finish\nwin immunity. Safe from the vote.\nNobody going home. -You will live to see day nine.\n-(chickens clucking) In addition,\nyou're playing for a reward. Yes, come on. -(excited chatter)\n-Ladies and gents, let's go. Do I hear chickens or something?\n(chuckles) Or animals? I don't know.\nI'm, like... -Oh...\n-Oh, my goodness. First tribe to finish... (clucking) -Oh, my God.\n-(cheering, whooping) Three egg-laying hens. -Egg-laying hens.\n-Ah. PROBST:\nSecond tribe to finish... ...six eggs from\nthe three egg-laying hens. -Oh, my God, man.\n-Wow. -Okay. All right. Okay.\n-PROBST: Last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers, got nothing for you but a date\nwith me at Tribal Council, where somebody\nwill be the fourth person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing,\nI will take your flint. Lavo, you are working\nto earn yours back. All right, we have no sit-outs. We are even.\nFive across the board. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get it on. Let's do it. Let's get it on. \u266a \u266a All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! First, you got\nto move a very heavy cube. It's gonna\ntake everything you got. SUE:\nPush, push. Go, go. PROBST:\nMake sure you don't run\ninto somebody else with it, 'cause it will hurt. -GABE: Ride the bounce.\nRide the bounce...\n-TEENY: We got it. -Great job.\n-GABE: Ride the bounce.\nRide the bounce. Keep rolling. PROBST:\nTuku doing a nice job. (overlapping shouting) Watch your feet. You got to get\nit underneath the first bag... -(grunting)\n-...so you can get somebody\nup top to retrieve that bag. -TEENY: Go.\n-Lavo doing a nice job. They're under that first bag,\nsorta.\n-TEENY: Nice, Rome. Rome going up top\nto unclip that first bag. Gata's at the first bag. Tuku still going. (grunting) TEENY:\nUnclip. You don't need to untie. PROBST:\nRome's got it for Lavo. -SAM: Get up there.\n-PROBST: Anika going up\nfor Gata. Kyle going up for Tuku. Anika has the bag. Kyle has the bag. Once you get that bag, get down. Do not dillydally. You're taking too much time. -TIYANA: Yep, you got it.\n-PROBST: Now you got to move it\nto the other bag. -Rome has it. Get down, Rome.\n-TEENY: Jump down. Jump down. TIYANA:\nYeah, Kyle. PROBST:\nTuku has their second bag. SIERRA:\nDrop it. Drop it. -PROBST: Gata has theirs.\n-ANIKA: Sorry. PROBST:\nIt's gonna be Sol and Kyle... SUE:\nGo all the way up, Kyle. -...and Sam.\n-Nice, Sol. PROBST:\nYou've got to empty those bags. -GENEVIEVE: Doing amazing.\n-You're gonna find two sandbags and the pieces you need\nto make this window frame -that you're gonna\nthrow the sandbags through.\n-SUE: Good job, Kyle. -TIYANA: Great job.\n-PROBST: Kyle has\nhis pieces free. Starts building the frame. Sol has his pieces free. That's the top. -TIYANA: That goes on top.\n-SUE: Go, Kyle. Kyle can start for Tuku\nwith his first toss. GABE:\nAll right,\ntake your time, brother. Take your time. PROBST:\nOn and off. Another toss. Just misses. ANIKA:\nThere you go, Sam. PROBST:\nSam has all the pieces. He can start building the frame. -(whooping)\n-Kyle tosses. No good. Kyle,\nthat sandbag will not count. It's got to be a clean toss. TEENY:\nYou got it, Sol. -Yeah!\n-PROBST: Sol with the first one. -(cheering)\n-Sol with two in a row... -This now, right?\n-...for Lavo. Wow! SOL:\nAll right, pull the corners. PROBST:\nTwo tosses. Sol landed 'em both. -You're made for this, Sam.\n-PROBST: Here goes Sam. -Sam sticks one.\n-Nice. There we go, Sam. -PROBST: Kyle sticks one.\n-(cheering) -(overlapping chatter)\n-Sol gave Lavo a big lead. Sam, you're good.\nLet's go, Gata. -You're good, Kyle.\n-ANIKA: Beautiful. PROBST:\nLet's go, Tuku. TIYANA\nSandbags, sandbags, sandbags. Everybody working\non the sandbags now. -You got to get all\nthe sandbags to your platform.\n-(grunting) They are very heavy. CAROLINE:\nThey are very heavy. PROBST:\nYou cannot start digging\nuntil you have all your sandbags on your platform. Lavo, you're good.\nStart digging. SOL:\nLet's go, guys. Come on. -(grunts loudly)\n-CAROLINE: We're good. -Jeff?\n-You're good. You're good. -Dig.\n-SAM: Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go,\nlet's go.

PROBST:\nLavo has their key. Gata has their key. -Tuku has their key.\n-Pull it! ANDY:\nPull it, pull it, pull it. We are dead even right now... Oh, there's multiple keys? ...as we head into the final\nstage of this challenge. SOL:\nUnlock it. Unlock it. Unlock it. Yeah. You're good, Lavo.\nLavo's through. They can start\nworking on the puzzle. -Gabe has it for Tuku.\n-Yeah, go. PROBST:\nYou can work on your puzzle,\nTuku. Gata's through.\nYou can work on your puzzle. -TIYANA: Okay, babe.\n-KYLE: All right,\nhere we go, baby. -PROBST: It's gonna be\nCaroline and Gabe for Tuku.\n-SUE: Let's go, guys. PROBST:\nRome and Genevieve for Lavo. Anika and Rachel for Gata. GENEVIEVE:\nOkay. PROBST:\nDay eight.\nYou want to get to day nine. -It's right here.\n-CAROLINE: Oh, yeah, it is.\nYeah, it is. PROBST:\nCaroline gets\nthe first piece for Tuku. -SIERRA: Nice.\nWay to go, Rachel.\n-Yes. And Rachel with the first piece\nfor Gata. -Rome's trying\nto get the first piece.\n-Right hand! He's taking the throne position. -He will be handed pieces\nby Genevieve.\n-CAROLINE: I got this one. Got it. SUE:\nYeah, Caroline! -You got it?\n-PROBST: It is Gata and Tuku -moving quickly.\n-Yes. Good job, Ani. -CAROLINE: Yeah, that's it.\nThat's it.\n-Move. PROBST:\nRome still looking\nfor that first piece for Lavo. It's either gonna be that\nor something similar to that on the left side. PROBST:\nThat first piece gives you\nan idea of how these pieces go together. Once you get it,\nit gets a little easier. TIYANA:\nGreat job, Caroline. Not... That is not it,\neither side. PROBST:\nOnce again on the puzzle,\nit is Tuku and Gata in a showdown. -Thataway, Rach.\n-PROBST: It is Gata in the lead. -I got it.\n-PROBST: Then Tuku.\n-TIYANA: Beautiful, Caroline. PROBST:\nAnd then dead last, without a single spark\nof flame, it is Lavo. GENEVIEVE:\nWe just need our first piece. SOL:\nNope, not it, Rome. -ANDY: There you go, girls.\n-SAM: Great job, girls. PROBST: Gata continues\nto expand on their lead. Gata looking very good\nright now. -Got it.\n-PROBST: Another piece for Tuku. TIYANA:\nYes, Gabe. -PROBST: Same story at Lavo.\n-Not it, Rome. PROBST:\nNow you start\nto question, \"What is wrong?\" -SOL: Not it, Rome.\nPROBST: Why can I not\nget a piece to fit? SOL:\nThat is not the piece, Rome. Not even one piece. -That's not it.\n-That's not it. PROBST:\nMeanwhile, Rachel and Anika\nmaking it look easy. You're doing so amazingly well. PROBST:\nLike assassins, piece by piece,\none after the other. -Caroline\nwith another piece for Tuku.\n-Great job, Caroline. You guys want to switch roles? SAM:\nThere you go, girls. -Way to go, guys. You killed it.\n-Finish it off. Gata down to their last piece. -PROBST: That is it.\nWhat a calm finish.\n-Great job. Gata wins immunity\nand the chickens for reward. -We got chickens.\n-PROBST: We're now\nlooking for one more. Very similar\nto the last challenge where Lavo was struggling to get\nanything going on the puzzle. That's not it, Rome. Rome's plopped in front\nof the puzzle and has made no progress\nwith Genevieve. Come on, Jeff. One after another,\ntrying every piece. Nothing is sticking.\nNo changes made. No assessment,\nreassessment, nothing. Tuku getting closer. Oh, my God. Kill me now. PROBST:\nGabe leaving Caroline\nto finish it for Tuku. Oh, my God. PROBST:\nLavo just gonna watch? There it is.\nTuku wins immunity and six eggs, sending Lavo back to Tribal Council for the second straight time, where somebody will be\nthe fourth person voted out of Survivor 47. PROBST:\nA rare, rare visual. A puzzle that ended\nthe same way it started, as if it never happened. All right, Gata,\nanother convincing victory. -(whooping)\n-SUE: Good job, guys. -Good job.\n-PROBST: Once again,\nimmunity is yours. Nobody going home,\nno Tribal Council tonight. In addition,\nwaiting for you back at camp-- three egg-laying hens. Well done.\nTuku also finished. -(whooping)\n-Wins immunity. Once again, safe from the vote. Waiting for you back at camp-- six eggs from those three\negg-laying hens. All right,\nbefore I send you off, we have a journey. Gata, you're in charge. You're gonna send somebody\nfrom each tribe. It cannot be somebody\nwho's already been on a journey. So first take a moment and tell\nus who's going from your tribe. -(indistinct chatter)\n-It's gonna be Andy. All right, now,\nwho's gonna join Andy from Lavo? Teeny. All right, Andy,\nwho's gonna join you from Tuku? -We're gonna pick Caroline.\n-PROBST: Caroline. -All right.\n-PROBST: Okay, Andy, Teeny, Caroline,\ngrab your stuff, head out. You will return back\nto your camp -in time for Tribal Council.\n-Bye, guys. (overlapping chatter) -ROME: Good luck. Good luck.\n-PROBST: All right, Gata, Tuku, grab your stuff,\nhead back to camp. No Tribal Council tonight.\nNobody going home. Yes, sir. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAll right, Lavo,\nlet's first just talk. Rome and Genevieve,\ndescribe that frustration because it's very different\nwhen you're out here. I've never tried to do a puzzle\nunder these conditions -and with that pressure.\n-ROME: So, you know, the two times I've been\nat the end of a challenge, I've been able to clutch it up. So I felt confident\nthat I would be able to, you know,\npotentially do this. And then, you know,\nyour family's gonna be seeing you try to do a puzzle and not be able\nto get one piece, and it's just...\nit's just really embarrassing. PROBST:\nAll right, Lavo, Tribal Council tonight,\nwhere somebody will be the fourth person\nvoted out of Survivor 47. As a penalty for losing,\nI will keep your flint. You'll have a chance to earn it\nback at the next challenge. All right, head out. See you\ntonight at Tribal Council. GENEVIEVE:\n Losing today's challenge and the way\nwe lost it really sucked. While the other tribes\n might be enjoying chickens and having scrambled eggs,\n we've got Tribal Council, and we are going to be having\n a straight-up scramble to see who goes home, so... not great. Not great. Ah, it's so easy\nwhen you're sitting at home, but when you're out here\nin Fiji, it is a whole different game. Think you could solve this\npuzzle? Apply to be on Survivor.

SIERRA:\nThe chicken's out! Grab the chicken! SAM:\n I'm eight days without food. I don't care anymore.\nJust give me the green light, and that chicken, uh, will... You know,\nit's going to the butcher shop. (clucking) GENEVIEVE:\nWell, that was embarrassing. ROME:\nThat was very embarrassing. -I think we just\ncollectively know...\n-SOL: Yeah. -...we're not good...\n-At puzzles. ...at those type...\nthose types of puzzles. ROME:\n I put myself in the final\n position to do the puzzle. I definitely want\nto be the person that's in that clutch role. Yeah, not getting one piece\nwas demoralizing. Yeah. ROME:\n And honestly, I was just absolutely awful. All right, well,\nyou guys ready to go wash off? GENEVIEVE:\nI don't know\nif I'm gonna go in the water. It's so chilly. KISHAN: I don't think\nI'm gonna go in the water. ROME: Fortunately,\n I have faith in the core four. So even though Gata chose Teeny\n to go on the journey, in our heads\n we already know the game plan. It's gonna be Sol. It's just\nabout how it goes down. So we all know the plan. It just sucks\nthat it had to happen now. I feel like\nI should at this point. ROME:\n I still have the Steal a Vote\n in my pocket, so, if I feel like Sol might\n play his Shot in the Dark, guess what.\n I can use the Steal a Vote and make sure he can't play\n his Shot in the Dark, because you have to have a vote in order\nto play a Shot in the Dark. I'd rather try and convince him -of another plan\nand at least see how he...\n-If he bites? Like, we can get a vibe\nwhether he believes it or not. But the thing is, I don't want\n to use this Steal a Vote, because if we, as an alliance,\n can keep this advantage, then we'll be sitting really\npretty heading into the merge. I do think\nwe can maybe give him a name and make him feel comfortable. Does Genevieve sound believable? 'Cause we could always push,\n like, we need tribe strength. We feel she's given the least. That's probably\nthe most believable. KISHAN:\n Rome proposes,\n \"Let's maybe try to see \"if we can comfort Sol\n in this fake plan that the vote is gonna be\n on someone else.\" And I was like, \"Maybe. What about Genevieve? \"You know,\nstrength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve?\" Just 'cause\nI do not want my name heard. It hasn't been heard yet.\nI don't want it out there. ROME:\nDo you think there's any way\nwe could convince him to give up his Shot in the Dark? Be like, \"I am taking your vote\nif you don't vote with us.\" -Yeah.\n-And we can say\nthat it's gonna be Genevieve. Like, I could just\nstraight-up threaten him. I'd have no problem doing that. Yeah. That works. Anything that works. I feel actually\npretty good about that. ROME:\nIt might be a little villainous. You know,\nI could strong-arm Sol tonight, and little does he know that he's gonna be\ngone regardless. But at the end of the day,\nat least I'll let him choose\nhow he goes out. -What?\n-Just-just wait, just... I feel like if I give him that ultimatum, I feel like\nhe might actually break. It's more than likely\ngonna be you tonight. But hear me out. I'm willing\nto work with you for this vote to make it the way\nthat we want to. The way that we'll be able\nto do it is because -I have a Steal a Vote.\n-Dude. I will use this Steal a Vote\non Genevieve tonight. But the only way\nthat I'm doing that, -and I'm letting you\nknow that...\n-Yeah? ...is if you give me\nyour Shot in the Dark. I'm letting you know,\nif you don't give me your Shot in the Dark,\nI'm using the Steal a Vote on you tonight, and then you can't play\nyour Shot in the Dark anyway. I'm letting you know that right\nnow, and you'll be going home. -I have the advantage...\n-What are you talking about,\nbro? You're, like,\nthreatening me right now. This isn't a threat. I'm just\nletting you know the situation. -Is this real life, bro?\n-This is Survivor, bro. SOL:\n I was like, \"Bro, really?\n It's like, you can't be\n threatening people.\" But, you know, the villain\non this season is Rome. \"Congratulations.\nThis advantage allows you \"to steal a vote\nfrom another player at Tribal Council.\" Blah-blah-\nblah-blah-blah-blah-blah. SOL:\n It's a slap in the face,\n 'cause, uh, nobody,\nespecially of Rome's size, has ever talked to me\n the way he has, and I don't plan on working\n with him ever in this game. And then here's the thing.\nHere's the thing. -How can I...?\n-That's fine. If you don't want to do it,\nthat's fine. I'm using my Steal a Vote\non you tonight, and you'll be going home. I can't believe\nyou're doing this to me, dawg. Down to the water. -To what?\n-The water. -SOL: You just threatened me.\n -ROME: That's not a threat. It's an ultimatum.\nThat's not a threat. -That's an ultimatum.\n-Oh, okay. -An ultimatum is not a threat.\n-Okay. My bad. My fault. KISHAN:\n You know, the obvious vote is,\n we vote for Sol, and then, on the other hand,\n you have Rome. His thing is, \"It's my show.\nYou know, Lavo is Rome.\" And I'm starting\n to get sick of it. He's playing chaotically.\n That scares me. You know, I can trust him now.\nCan I trust him in the future? -Yeah.\n-Even if he steals a vote, -that's two votes on Sol.\n-Yeah. Even if Teeny loses her vote,\nif us two vote Rome... -And it's...\n-Rome will die. He will die. -I know.\n-You're...\nI can see you grinning. -Bad boy. Bad boy. (laughs)\n-Ooh. -Naughty, naughty.\n-Naughty, naughty. KISHAN:\n I want to switch the vote\n onto Rome because I think\n the true benefit of this is Rome is super tight\nwith Genevieve. Once Rome's gone,\n that leaves Genevieve in a really vulnerable position. Okay. Dude, I'm ready\nto go to Tribal now. KISHAN:\n If we get out Rome, and\n we let Sol in, into the plan, Sol now trusts me because I have created the plan\nto save him. He is going\nto be completely shocked. If this happens,\nthis will feel so... good. Okay. -It's going to happen.\n-Okay. Yeah. This is one of the best feelings\n in the world. Rome is the vote. He's going to have no clue.\n I'm so happy. (laughing) At tonight's Tribal, Rome will burn. \u266a \u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a Kia.\n Movement that inspires.

I personally think that journeys\nare a great opportunity to switch up your luck\nif you're on the bottom. But if you're in\na pretty good position, like me, this just puts\n a bigger target on your back. Well, can we take some time\nto chat? Yes, we can chat beforehand.

I'm gonna deal\n with them head-on, and I'm going\nto make them advantages. -There was a bros alliance\nour first few days.\n-ANDY: Oh. TEENY:\nIs it still kind of bro-y? CAROLINE:\nIn general,\nvibes have completely shifted is what I would say. -I'm glad. I'm glad.\n-Yes. I'm in a position\nof low information, I think. So I feel like, you know, -on the bottom.\n-Yeah.\n-Okay. And if you want to know\nwhere the crack is at Gata, like, come find me at the merge. I'm trying to massage my image. I'm trying to do some PR, like, that if I am someone\nwho feels like a social outcast on my tribe, that is the picture-perfect archetype\n of someone that players want to scoop up\nat the merge, not target. Sol and Rome have sort of,\nlike, this machismo-off, -where, like, they're... Yeah.\n-Interesting. Like, they are\nkind of like an ego battle. So I feel like\nit would be one of them tonight. -Those are my guesses...\n-ANDY: Okay. Okay. -...based on last time.\n-CAROLINE: Again, I get really good vibes\ngenuinely from the both of you. -Seriously. No, this is real.\n-I know. -This is better than I, like,\nfelt so far. Yeah.\n-Yeah. No matter what,\ngood luck, you all. -No hard feelings whatsoever.\n-Okay. Okay. I feel like I'm next. -Yeah.\n-Would you volunteer? Ours is looking\nreally, really shaky, genuinely, about\nwhere the pieces are going. I mean, obviously,\nI'm going tonight, right? ANDY:\nYes. Yes. Is-is there a consensus,\nthough-- Rome versus Sol? No, but I feel like\nI do kind of trust the people I'm working with,\nbut, like, you guys do have to understand,\nlike, I'm going, -and neither of you are going.\n-Understood. TEENY:\n Neither of them are budging. My next Tribal Council is-is... is now. You know,\nI don't have much time to waste. Like, you guys\nat least have some time. I don't want to lose my vote. -I think... I'm sorry.\n-I think I have to think\nabout it. -We don't have much time.\n-Let me just... Can I just think real quick\nabout, like, -the numbers real quick?\n-Please.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. CAROLINE:\n I'm getting so nervous. If no one volunteers\nto give up their vote, all three of us lose our vote\n at the next Tribal. It's the very,\n very worst-case scenario. Okay, you know what?\nI'll do it. -I love you. Okay. Perfect.\n-Thank you.\n-I'll do it. I don't want\n to look back on this and feel like an idiot, but whether it's Rome or it's Sol going home tonight, I think\n it could work without my vote. All right, guys. ANDY:\nOh. TEENY:\n And in that moment, I felt I'm losing my vote either way. I either get something\nout of it, or I don't. -Okay, I get it.\n-CAROLINE: And so\nit's an idol no matter what. It's an idol...\nthat we agree on. (gasps)\nYes. That's better. Okay, but, like, we can't use it to be funky with each other. It's different rules.\nAll we have to do. Like, when we use it,\nit will be all in agreement, -and we'll be ready to go.\n-To use as an idol. ANDY:\n Now, this is a new amulet.\n This is not like amulets we've seen in the past. The\nrules are slightly different. We can use this\n to be a hidden immunity idol. But in many ways\n the inherent dilemma remains. Is this an opportunity for peace and collaboration, or is it an opportunity\nfor warfare?

I actually think this is\na huge key for us to... -GABE: Agreed.\n-We form a dominant alliance\nat the merge. Long story short,\nI ended up with a friend for us. (all exclaiming) Okay, here's how it works.\nDifferent type of amulet. If the three holders can agree\nto play it, and it's an idol. Uh-oh. GENEVIEVE:\nYeah. So I was like,\n\"I'll just lose it tonight. \"'Cause I'm gonna lose it\neither way. -Might as well get something\nout of it.\"\n-Mm-hmm. We all got amulets. -Ooh.\n-TEENY: They can only be used -when all players are\non the same beach.\n-Oh, okay. -No.\n-Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Me and Genevieve\nare voting Rome. KISHAN:\nYeah. TEENY:\n I definitely feel powerless\n without a vote. But I feel really lucky\nto have found alliance partners who are coming up with plans\nwithout me even being there, especially\n with my number one Kishan. I'm proud of you guys\nfor coming up with this... That was all Kish.\nI just, like, sat here and got told the plan.\nIt was amazing. -Just, are you telling Sol?\n-We told Sol. -You did?\n-He is totally game. -So I can tell Sol, too?\n-Yes. -Like, you're in.\n-Yeah. -You're fully in.\n-Yeah. -And I'm so happy.\n-Me, too. TEENY:\n Sol is somebody\n who I want to keep. And if that means\n that we get out Rome, who is a bit of a nuisance\n around camp, who stresses us out\n in the game a little bit, then great.\nIt's a win-win. The plan was,\nthat me and Kishan came up with, was to tell Sol\nthat we're voting for Genevieve. Interesting.\nAnd whose suggestion was -to throw Genevieve's name out?\n-Uh, Kishan. But I get why you wouldn't...\nwouldn't like that, obviously. -Yes. Yeah.\n-Nobody likes\ntheir name being... being the, you know, the decoy,\nbut obviously we, like... -100%. 100%.\n-Yeah, we're good to go. So it wasn't, like,\na malice thing -that Kishan threw your name\nout there.\n-No. -Of course not.\n-Like, I promise. Does Genevieve sound believable? I'm not here to play safe.\nI'm here to create some chaos. What about Genevieve? You know,\n strength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve? Once Rome's gone, that leaves Genevieve\nin a really vulnerable position. GENEVIEVE:\n Rome going home\n is Kishan's plan. And I am a bossy, type A woman, and I don't want to just\n be going along with plans, especially if they're not\nin my best interests. Like, Rome is an asset\nfor me in this game. And he's ruffling\npeople's feathers, but not mine. He trusts me.\n He will have my back. I mean, as much\n as anyone out here will. And the biggest red flag\n for me is, Kishan doesn't hesitate to use\n my name as the decoy vote, which lets me know he's not really intimidated\n or respecting my game. So maybe it's time to stop going along\nwith Kishan's plan and make Kishan the plan. -What's up?\n-I need to give you a heads-up, -and I need to make it quick.\n-Okay. You're the plan tonight. I'm 100% serious. -So, does Teeny\nknow about this?\n-Everyone knows about it. All these brilliant plans\nare his. What do you want to do? ROME:\n That's just so wild that Kishan would\n throw that out there. Why would they want me out if they know I'm going hard\nfor the alliance? That's just so... The second\n that I heard Kishan might want to put my name out there,\nI was a little bit hurt because I wanted to do everything\nthat I could to make the alliance\nas strong as possible. And now, at this point, I don't feel like I can trust anyone in this game\n but Genevieve. Does Sol know about it? ROME:\n My Steal a Vote\n could be massive tonight. Maybe we could\n just get out Kishan. Or I could block him completely\n from being able to vote and put two votes on Sol. And just like that,\n Sol will be going home. I'm willing to do it\n because guess what. I already know\n the guy doesn't like me. This, uh, uh, crazy, toxic, brother-like relationship\n is a huge problem long-term. -He put Rome up to it.\n-Uh-huh. And everyone is benefiting\nfrom you two fighting. Uh-huh. There's no way\nI'm not voting Rome tonight. Let's just stick... Can we\nplease just stick to the plan? GENEVIEVE:\n There is no way I can pull off\n a Kishan blindside without Rome and Sol,\nbut they're openly adversaries. And then\n Teeny doesn't have a vote, and she's really close\n with Kishan. So that's really not an option\n to me. -I know.\n-Like, why? -'Cause Genevieve loves us.\n-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:\n But Rome and Sol have now\n just had this big fight, almost to the point\nthat it's irreparable damage that can't be undone. So it is going to take a miracle to get them to work together. There's just no, no, no way. ROME:\nSol, I just want to say that, like, I know that I\nprobably came across way wrong, and, like, I just want you\nto know that I'm... I apologize\nif I came off threatening or whatever, you know,\nyou may think. SOL:\nAll right, I appreciate that. -Okay. Okay.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a game. -We need to get control.\n-Right, but... -We're not gonna have it.\n-...after, after... -We're not gonna have it.\n-Yes, we will. I... We're not gonna have it. Could be\na million-dollar decision. Sol's like, \"I don't want\n to work with Rome.\" Rome's like, \"It's a done deal. Sol is going home tonight.\" And what would be best\n for my game would be to take a stealth shot at Kishan\nthat he wouldn't see coming. Is it bad that I'm excited? It's gonna be a wild night. The problem is, you have to be in the majority,\n you need numbers. It is not a one-person game.\nGenevieve doesn't get to pick. But with so few votes, and because the Steal a Vote\n advantage exists, anything could happen, and it wouldn't take too much to turn the tide. Wa nt t o ge t th e mo st o ut of o ne s he et ?

HMP is responsible for the\n content of this advertising. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAll right. So let's start by talking\nabout today's challenge. Rome, I've never really seen\nanything like today in the sense that you got to the puzzle\nfirst and never got a single piece,\nnot one piece of the puzzle. ROME:\nYou know, we did great in the first part\nof the challenge today. We were the first ones to get\nto the puzzle, so I stepped up. I wanted to, you know,\ntry my hand at it. And, unfortunately,\nI failed pretty miserably. PROBST:\nI was surprised that you never wanted\na different perspective, like to step back\nor to look at it this way. You just kept,\nlike a doctor taking the... Maybe Kishan can give\na better analogy, but... -(laughter)\n-Scalpel. PROBST:\nLike the scalpel, yeah. ROME:\nWell, I don't even know if doing it differently\nwould have changed anything, in all honesty.\nI truly feel like we're just not that great at those specific\ntype of puzzles. PROBST:\nOkay, so you lost,\nyou're back here at Tribal. So, Sol, if I dropped in\non Camp Lavo this afternoon, what would I notice happening? Chaos times ten is what\nyou would have walked into. -Wow.\n-Yeah. Look, after the challenge,\nRome announces to me that he has a Steal a Vote, which shocked the hell\nout of me. And he basically said, \"Since you're on the bottom,\nyou and I can work together. \"Uh, the only way\nI'll do that, though, is if you give me\nyour Shot in the Dark.\" ROME:\nListen, it's not like he didn't write my name down last Tribal Council. He did. So I told him, \"The only way\nthat I would trust you \"to work with you is if you\ngive me your Shot in the Dark. \"But if you don't, \"then I'm gonna use\nmy Steal a Vote on you, \"and you're not gonna be able\nto play your Shot in the Dark, and you're gonna\nbe going home tonight.\" Sol, given the fact\nthat you did vote for Rome, that's not\nthat unusual a request. SOL:\nIt's kind of smart, but at the same time, for me,\nthe way he went about it, that's the key.\nI didn't appreciate it, and so I said,\n\"Are you threatening me, dude?\" -Uh, what did you say?\n-I said, \"No. -it's an ultimatum,\nnot a threat.\"\n-Right. And so, for me, it sounds\nlike a threat, so I said, \"No, I'm not doing it.\" PROBST:\nAnd, Rome, your threat about -stealing his vote is...\n-Ultimatum, Jeff. -(laughter)\n-The ultimatum about stealing his vote is\nthat you have to have a vote in order\nto play the Shot in the Dark. ROME:\nPrecisely. And I just want to say, Jeff, I, in the moment, thought that that was\nthe right thing to do, but the way that I did it and\nthe way that I approached Sol was just not respectful. Everyone that knows me\nin real life knows I'm a super genuine person. So I went to him today,\nand I apologized, and I think\nthat he does understand that that's...\nthat's just not who I am. PROBST:\nKishan,\nwhat's your take on this? Because\nwhen there's only five of you, it doesn't take much\nto vote somebody out. An argument can do it. You know, we're spending\n24 hours a day with each other. I think\nwhen you're so deprived of food, you can't sleep at night, there are parts\nof people's personalities that are gonna come out\nthat bother you, that irk you. But I think if you let\nan argument guide your vote, that's letting emotions get\nto you. I think\nwhen you're playing this game, you have to be more strategic\nthan that. -PROBST: Teeny,\nhow about for you?\n-From my vantage point as somebody who wasn't involved\nin the fight and also from my vantage point\nas someone who did lose their vote\non a journey today, all I could really do\nis put trust in the people that I had\nworked with last Tribal Council and hope that it goes well. PROBST:\nGenevieve,\nwhat do you make about this? Because it sounds like there could be two people\nthat aren't voting. Teeny lost her vote, Rome is threatening\nto steal somebody else's vote. That means\nit could be four total votes, but just three people. Yeah. It means... those three people\nhave a lot of power. And you better hope those three\npeople are working with you and have your back, because they're gonna rule the day\ntoday. KISHAN:\nJeff, I don't think at the end of the day\nit changes much because it comes down to trust. You trust the conversations\nyou had. You trust a plan\nthat you've set forward. It doesn't matter\nbecause you trust -what the plan is in place.\n-PROBST: So, Sol, that can't make you feel great. Nope. Not great at all, and, um, I'm just begging Rome, bro, maybe not steal my vote? I do have\nmy Shot in the Dark here. If my vote is not gone,\nI am playing it. PROBST:\nAnd, Rome, what's interesting\nabout this is, that's a real person... -Yeah.\n-I am a very real person... -PROBST: ...saying to you...\n-...in the flesh behind you. -Yeah.\n-...that, \"I'm already\nin trouble, I think. And now you're taking\nthe only protection I have,\" which is the only move to make\nif you want to take out Sol. But Sol's pleading with you, \"Give me a shot.\" ROME:\nAt the end of the day,\nit's going to be my decision whether or not I, uh, I take this guy's vote\nor not, and, you know, I just got to trust\nthe people that I trust, and the people that I don't\ntrust, I'm not gonna trust you, and I'm going\nto do everything I can to get you out of this game. Wow. Ooh. (laughs) -Spooky, scary, right?\n-Yeah. Is that the kind of laugh\nyou give when you're watching Survivor at home, Genevieve? When I'm watching Tribal, and it gets like this,\nand you're like, \"Oh, my God. Ooh,\nsomething's happening.\" Like... So from all this chaos, where do you sit right now as\nwe are moments away from voting? So, chaos times ten can be great\nas long as you're not in it.

Rome, you are\ntaking Kishan's vote, which means, Kishan,\nyou will not vote tonight. Rome, when you go up,\nyou will vote twice. All right, it is time to vote.\nGenevieve, you're up. \u266a \u266a I'm absolutely freaking out. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes.

        "transcript":"Stop Garvey. Adam Schiff for Senate. I'm Adam Schiff,\n and I approve this message. \u266a \u266a TEVIN: Survivor is 18 people coming together from all different\n walks of life. And they are here,\n all together at one time, having to trust each other,\n build a society, play challenges with each other\n with different strengths, different weaknesses. And to be able\n to trust one another while also not trusting anyone, because you're playing\na game that is built on deceit. And you have to be vulnerable, and you have to be\n authentically yourself. And you have\n to overcome and adapt to all the challenges in which\n they are guaranteed to face, because that\n is what Survivor is about. (laughs) But it is\n in that moment right there makes the game so worth playing. And I'm ready for it. (all cheering) CHARLIE:\n Let's go, Siga! \u266a \u266a BHANU: I applied for Survivor the day I become a citizen\nof the United States of America. I came out of the courthouse,\n and I was like, \"Hello, Survivor team, Jeff Probst!\" Hi. Hello. Namaste. I want one opportunity\n to play the game, so I can be a role model for all the folks\nwho look like me. From slumdog to Survivor, baby! (laughs) \u266a \u266a JESS:\n I actually think that\n the biggest risk to my game is, like, I might\n be socially awkward. And my personality is, like... I know I'm a little odd. But I don't really care. But I've come to realize\n that I'm competitive. (laughing) I mean,\n I have an identical twin. I've been\ncompeting for nutrients since we were in the womb. BOTH:\nChoo choo! Here we are in the rain. I grew up in a small town\n in Mississippi. I lived there my whole life,\n and I teach there now. And so there's experiences\nthat I haven't had that I know\na lot of other people have. There will be this barrier\n of maybe not being able to relate on a full level.\n You know, if people bond over, you know, being huge Taylor Swift,\nyou know, fans, I-I won't have that. I got my Taylor Swift socks. I got my Taylor Swift\nEras Tour merch. I ride the Swiftie bus\n on the way to law school, but I'm not planning\non mentioning I went to Harvard, because you got\nto keep your threat level down. Objection. \u266a \u266a TIFFANY: I've worked with\n major brands like Nike, Adidas. I had my artwork displayed\nin Madison Square Garden. I'm self-taught. Me and YouTube University\n is all I had when I was figuring out\n my job as an artist. 'Cause at the end of the day,\n being an artist is a hustle. But that's what I do. I'm a hustler. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\n This group of strangers\n has agreed to be abandoned\n in the Fijian Islands. They must learn to adapt\n or they'll be voted out. VENUS:\n I may look tiny and weak,\n but I am mighty and strong. I'm gonna do some sneaky ... and I'll deal\nwith the repercussions later. PROBST:\n In the end,\n only one will remain to claim\n the million-dollar prize. KENZIE:\n I've got my stilettos on,\n disco ball spinning. I'm just waiting\n for the club to open. Like, I'm ready to party!\n(chuckles) \u266a \u266a Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay\nand outlast all the rest? This is Survivor 46. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a SODA: I'm wet,\n people around me are wet, -(cheering, whooping) -but I'm about to play\n100 per-freaking-cent, bro. I'm ready, man. I'm here to prove me to myself. And for all my students, like, you can say yes\n to the adventure. You can conquer anything. I'm here to, like,\n be a model for them, 100%. Q: I started playing football\n when I was nine years old, and it made me, at an early age,\nbe very, very competitive. I do not like to lose. So I'm gonna play this game\n full speed, from day one. I'm the QB. I'm quarterbacking the game. Put the ball down, say hut. -All right.\nWelcome to Survivor 46.\n-(Soda squeals) (all cheering) Oh, my God. I got to say, I'm impressed\nwith the enthusiasm, -given the boat rides\nI can anticipate you just had.\n-(overlapping chatter) I don't know whether to laugh\nor cry or crap my pants. PROBST:\nPretty rough seas? -Yes.\n-Very rough. -Very.\n-Who vomited? -(laughing)\n-SODA: So close. Yeah. Sometimes you're\nbirthed into Survivor in a nice, smooth,\nbeautiful day. Other days, it's a little rough. All right, let's get into it. It's always so exciting to start\na new season of Survivor because, right now,\neverything seems possible. You can all envision\nyourself at the end. You can all see\nyour name on the parchment, crowning you\nthe winner of Survivor 46. Oh! Because, right now, it kind of\nfeels like a blank slate, right? Q:\nIt does. PROBST:\nAnd you all, right now, believe you can win this game. But it's simply not true. Right now, there is at least\none of you that cannot win. No matter who you go to\nthe end with, it won't matter. Something about your personality\nis not gonna gel with this group,\nand you won't get the votes. And the beautiful thing about the confidence\nof a Survivor player is right now, you're all\nnodding in agreement, and yet none of you think\nyou're the one -who can't win.\n-(laughing) It's one of the reasons Survivor is so fun to watch, but it should be\nthe number-one reason why each of you play this game on your terms. Because that blind optimism\nthat you have right now, that specific point of view\nthat you're bringing into the game-- it's gonna work or not work, but it is\nyour single biggest weapon. I'm glad you're all here.\nI wish you luck. Let's get into our tribes. (cheering) (screaming) Wearing purple: Yanu. -Go, Yanu!\n-Yanu! (whooping) Let's go! Wearing green: you are Siga. ALL:\nSiga! -Let's go!\n-(whoops) And in orange: you are Nami. -Nami!\n-(cheering) -Nami! Nami!\n-(excited chatter) -(laughing)\n-Them, but Nami! -TEVIN: Know what I mean?\n-Yeah! (laughing) -Got that one.\n-(whooping) All right, you ready\nto get to your first challenge? -Yeah.\n-Let's do it.\n-Yes. Let's do this. PROBST:\nFor today's challenge, two members of each tribe\n are gonna race down the beach, crawl under a muddy net... ...and retrieve\n two very heavy puzzle pieces, then bring 'em back. Then the next pair goes. Once you have all six pieces, three tribe members are gonna use those pieces\n to build a podium. Then one tribe member will climb\n to the top of the podium, use a long pole\n to retrieve your flint. First tribe to finish\nearns their camp supplies-- pot, machete, flint. -Not much.\n-Enough. That's enough. -But it's-it's a start.\n-But it's enough. Exactly, Tevin. The second tribe\nto finish earns the right to choose between the Sweat\ntask or the Savvy task for their second shot\nat earning your tribe supplies. The last tribe to finish,\notherwise known as... -The losers.\n-Losers! -Not me.\n-PROBST: You get what's left. (laughing) Everybody feeling good? -Yeah!\n-TEVIN: I'm good. All right, follow me.\nWe'll get set up. (whoops) All right, here we go. Marooning challenge\nof Survivor 46. Survivors ready? Go! -Heading out in pairs.\n-(cheering) Tiffany and Jelinsky for Yanu. Jem and Ben for Siga. Hunter and Venus for Nami. Make the hole big.\nMake the hole big. PROBST:\nPieces are heavy. -SODA: Venus, go, go!\n-LIZ: Go! -Venus, go, go!\n-Go! RANDEN:\nKeep going, baby!\nYeah! Let's go! SODA:\nLet's go, Hunter! Let's go! -PROBST: Hunter moving quickly\nwith that first piece.\n-Yeah! PROBST:\nYou can head out and help, but you got to go back\nthrough the obstacles. (Soda whoops) PROBST:\nHunter making\nquick work of this. Now gonna help\nhis new Tribemate, Venus. These are big puzzle pieces.\nShe needs some help. Here comes Tiffany,\ncarrying one on her shoulder. Jelinsky right behind. Jem pushing one.\nBen pushing one. Once you cross that line,\nthe next pair can go. You're good! Go! It's Tevin and Liz out now. Hell yeah! Jump on that course like a\nstarving man on a Christmas ham! PROBST:\nHere comes Jelinsky. You're good! Go, Yanu! It's Siga in dead last. Come on, guys. -PROBST: Ben already exhausted.\n-Come on, Ben. -You're good! Go!\n-Good work. Good work. -Good work, Ben...\n-PROBST: It's gonna be\nCharlie and Maria. TIM:\nLet's go, Siga! Keep going! Come on! PROBST:\nHere comes Liz and Tevin\nheading back for Nami. -(grunting)\n-Bhanu and Jess out for Yanu. (all cheering) TIM:\nLet's go, Maria! Look at that!\nMaria carrying one on her back! -Come on! Siga!\n-(cheering) Maria. That is how you do it\non Survivor. Here comes Charlie,\nheading back for Siga. You're good! Go! CHARLIE:\nCome on, go, go, go! You got it! PROBST:\nYou're good! Go! -You're good! Go!\n-JELINSKY: Let's go, guys.\nLet's go, let's go, let's go. PROBST:\nIt is Randen and Soda\non the course. Tim and Moriah heading out. -The last two pieces got\nto travel the farthest distance.\n-SODA: Come on, guys! (grunts) PROBST:\nRanden heading back.\nHere comes Kenzie. Here comes Q. Tim and Moriah\ngot to go back out now and get their last piece. Every second counts. You want those tribe supplies. You're good. You're good. Start working on the puzzle. Come on, y'all. PROBST:\nHere comes Tim and Moriah. -You can hear, they're gassed.\n-(grunts) Ten minutes\ninto day one of Survivor. You're already feeling it. (overlapping chatter) You're good, Siga.\nStart working on your puzzle. This is where you see what your tribe is made of,\nright here. VENUS: Good. PROBST:\nOpening moments of Survivor 46. If you put yourself\nin the puzzle position, you are feeling the pressure. JEM:\nHey, guys, no. PROBST:\nYou are building\na three-tier podium. Always looks so easy\nwhen you're watching it at home. Soda, Hunter, Venus think they\nhave something now for Nami. JEM:\nYes! PROBST:\nJelinsky, Bhanu and Jess -trying to get\nsomething going for Yanu.\n-Push it in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Come on, Siga.\n-JEM: You're still in it. PROBST:\nMoriah, Tim and Ben, they've been moving their pieces\nall over the place. Come on, watch out,\nwatch out, watch out. -Yes, yes, yes.\n-PROBST: Hunter and Soda\nworking for Nami. They think\nthey're getting close. Venus putting\nthat last piece in. -(cheering)\n-That is right. You're out. -Somebody else is in.\n-HUNTER: Let's go, Tevin. It's gonna be Tevin now. It is Nami in the lead\nby a long ways right now. -(cheering)\n-Tevin! Baby! (chanting):\nNami! Nami! Nami! PROBST:\nTevin now going\nup top with that pole, trying to knock that ring off. That flint is all\nyou need in your hand. Yanu and Siga continue\nto fight to get in this. -You're almost there.\n-You're almost there. -HUNTER: Yeah!\n-PROBST: Tevin has it! (excited chatter) -Tevin has the ring.\n-(cheering) Nami has earned\ntheir tribe supplies. And now we're\nlooking for second place. TIM:\nThere we go. Something's wrong. -PROBST: Something not right\nfor Siga. A setback.\n-No, it's not right... Something's not right. PROBST:\nThat opens the door for Yanu. Jelinsky now running\naround to give it a study. Yeah. PROBST:\nSiga thinks they have something. Tim and Ben\nlifting that last piece. Will it fit?\nAnd if so, is it right? -(cheering)\n-You got it, Siga! Let's go! Gonna be Charlie now\nuntying the pole. It's all over for Yanu. -(overlapping chatter)\n-PROBST: Here goes Charlie. TIM:\nDrag it all the way, Charlie. (cheering) PROBST:\nThere it is. Charlie's got it for Siga. Siga will choose\nbetween Sweat and Savvy, -and Yanu will get what is left.\n-JEM: Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. All right,\nNami, congratulations. (cheering) Waiting for you back at camp:\na pot, machete and flint. It's not much, but in this game, in the early days,\nit is everything. Now we have another\nbig decision to make. Siga, you took second place, which means you get to choose whether you take on the Sweat\ntask or the Savvy task. So, what have you learned\nabout the six of you in these opening moments that's gonna determine\nwhat you choose? Uh, we're gonna choose Savvy. At the end of the day,\nit was the puzzle that allowed us\nto get that flint, so we're gonna keep on the roll. So that means, Yanu,\nyou will be taking on Sweat. -I ain't scared\nof a little sweat, Jeff.\n-(chuckles) Let's do it. All right,\nmaps to your new home. -Here you go.\n-Tevin, take it.\nYou swung that thing. Yes, Maria! (cheering) Giddyup, baby. Let's go. Survivor 46 is underway. -Yanu, Nami, Siga, head out.\nGood luck.\n-(cheering) (laughing) JEM:\nRight now, everybody's laughing. They're living\n their wildest dreams, but only one\n out of the 18 of us is gonna be the Sole Survivor. I'm so ready to just cut everybody else's throat on the other side, and then\nguess who's your Sole Survivor? Me. Se e?

We don't even\nhave trees out in Vegas-- no good trees, anyways--\n but I'm hyped. Let's get to the Sweat task.\n Let's play. Jeff preaches\nabout the monster in this game. Jelinsky is the monster. -JESS: Okay.\n-(sighs) Who thinks they can do it\nis the thing? -It's, like...\n-I mean, I think, I think -we all can do it...\n-We all can do it. It's just gonna take a long time -and people gonna be tired.\n-I can do it, for sure, yeah. -JESS: Yeah.\n-That's it. -Y'all want to do that?\n-Let's do it, yeah. TIFFANY:\nI appreciate you guys. -Yeah. Okay, good.\nWe'll knock it out.\n-We got it. We got it. One, two, three. TIFFANY:\nGood luck, guys. We believe in you. KENZIE:\nGood luck. \u266a \u266a The bucket had holes in it. Come on, Jeff. And now you're\n walking up the hill, around the hourglass,\n to the urn, which is about 40 yards\n of distance. That's it? So I could tell, at that point, that it was\ngonna be very difficult. But it doesn't bother me.\n Hard work is all I know. I'm a guy who's\n from Mississippi, small town, one of 17 kids, who had to work\nfor everything that he has. I've been a great businessman, a great real estate agent. I was the number two agent\n in the country. And that takes hard work. Like I told Jelinsky, you know,\nwe have to have that mentality that we keep going\nno matter what. ...or it's gonna\npush us further apart. -That's right.\n-I'd rather it bond us. I wonder what\nthey're doing back at camp. TIFFANY: Oh, my gosh. -Yeah.\n-Cool. -Welcome.\n-That's why I, you know, I struggle\nwith English a little bit. -That's okay.\n-Oh. BHANU:\n I'm in Fiji with my Buff on. I can't ask for more. Yes. Let's get going. (gasps) Yay! Oh, good find. -Never, ever leave this.\n-(laughs): Okay. -Oh, good.\n-Yeah. Survivor is Bhanu's life. I am originally\nfrom Visakhapatnam, India. I grew up in a hut\n made of palm leaves with, uh, mud floors. And that's how... I lived 18 years like that. 18 years. It was only last year\nI got my citizenship. -Oh, congratulations.\nI know that's hard.\n-Thank you, thank you. Yeah. But here I am. I'm a citizen\n of the United States. I'm so proud. Wow. And, as a superfan,\n I get to play Survivor. -Oh.\n-TIFFANY: Really? (sniffs) Ah. Sweet papaya. I'm the provider.\nWhen people come to me and say, like, you know, \"Can you\nhelp me? Can you do this? Can you do that?\" I love it,\n because Bhanu is always there. So, these ants... -Sure.\n-Okay. I eat them at home. You do? Like what? Like sprinkles? -(laughing)\n-JESS: There you go. My first ant on Survivor. (laughs) BHANU:\n I'm already comfortable\n being on Survivor. Beyond excited, nervous and thrilled to be on Survivor. (laughs) TIM: All right, gang. JEM: Yeah. Wah-wah. (laughing) TIM:\nAny volunteers? I think I'm into it. -Okay.\n-CHARLIE: I mean,\nI'll-I'll help Ben out. -Maybe we can\nwork through it together, but\n-JEM: You got it. no promises. When in doubt, rock out, right? There's, like, the lockbox,\n and then there's also this board\n with all these random letters. It looks hard-core,\nbut if I go home tomorrow, like, I want to know\n I at least stepped up. And Charlie and I are like front man, guitar player. You know? Diamond Dave, Eddie Van Halen. CHARLIE:\nLet's go. All right,\nthis is what I see, right? -Numbers, right?\nThere's six here.\n-Yup. I see 12, seven, six. BEN:\n 12, six... So, 12. Six. BEN:\nI see seven. CHARLIE:\nOkay. -So this would be a one.\n-And there's\nsome numbers going down, too. Like, I see 20. I see five. -You're seeing things\nthat I never saw, ever.\n-Yeah. -Okay.\n-Shout-out to my dyslexia. -Let's go! (chuckles)\n-You're killing it. You're-you're on fire. -BEN: Uh...\n-Four. Yeah, and six. So I'm-I'm noticing\nan issue right away is we've got six digits here -and ten digits here.\n-Ten. I don't know. I think\nwe got to think about this. Let's think\na little harder, I guess. CHARLIE:\n Machete, pot, flint. If you don't have those things, it's like, \"Game over.\" We have to figure this out.\n Like, it's a must. -TIM: Oh, fire.\n-MARIA: Yes. Then moved to New York,\nmet my husband in New York. Had our first kid.\nPregnant with my second. You had the mom strength.\nThat's what it was. -I told y'all I was taking it.\nI was like, \"I can pull...\"\n-(laughing) -I got two boys.\n-You have two boys?\nHow old are they? -Yeah, yeah. Five and two.\n-Aw. TIM:\nI miss them a great deal. I love my family. I want my sons to have\neverything that they imagine. So, Maria and I were rocking\n with the parent narrative. -I have a five-year-old, too.\n-Five? I have a ten,\nan eight and a five. Whoa! MARIA: I told my kids,\n \"Mommy is gonna lie, cheat and steal,\" because there's only one way to win, and that's by\ntaking everyone else out. Tim and I-- we've connected\n over being parents, but I have no intention\n of being anybody's mom. Likewise. Yeah, sure. I just am not going\n to be in the flashy red car. I'm gonna be in my little\nminivan driving the game. All right. I would do the three first,\nand then... 3-6-5-1-4-7. If this works, I'll eat a hat. BEN:\nNo dice. CHARLIE:\n The sand is\ntrickling through the hourglass. We were adding,\nsubtracting, multiplying. We tried everything. Maybe there's another word\nin the puzzle that's gonna\nhelp us crack the code. BEN:\nYes. I'm already looking. I mean... BEN:\nWhat is it we're not seeing? CHARLIE:\n\"All the information below\nto find what you are missing.\" There's nothing underneath it. (sighs) It's the final countdown. All right. It's the beginning\nof the Dumb and Dumber alliance. CHARLIE:\n The feeling when the timer\n runs out is just the worst. We have no pot.\nWe have no machete. We have no flint. This brings us together\nin our... -in our shared stupidity.\n-A hundred percent. CHARLIE:\n We're gonna look like idiots. We tried\nto step up for the tribe, and we-we failed, big time. -(laughing)\n-SODA: We crushed it, guys. HUNTER: We totally did it. How old are you? Twenty-four. -Wow!\n-SODA: No way! I-I have an old soul. I watch old things. Oh, sunshine! Opie. You watch Andy Griffith? -Yeah.\n-Oh, my God! What do you do? I teach people\nhow to write emails and make money on the Internet. VENUS:\nVery cool. -I've owned four companies.\n-SODA: Wow. I currently own two. I've sold two. -Oh! She sold them, too.\n-Oh. LIZ:\nYeah. I'm-I'm pretty awesome. TEVIN: As I talked to Liz,\n some of her comments made my head just kind of go...\n(groans) ...because you're talking about how you have\n all these businesses, and you're\n flaunting your dollar bills. Huh. Well, I'm out here for money. -It's nice\nto get to know everybody.\n-OTHERS: Yeah. TEVIN:\n Clearly, Liz forgot game begins not tomorrow,\nbut right now. We need fire. Is there anyone\nthat knows, like, knows-knows how to make fire? -I do. I-I mean,\nI feel pretty good about it.\n-I also do. LIZ:\nThat's awesome. I'm feeling good\nabout this tribe. We already have our pot,\n the machete, the flint, which is not a lot,\n but it leads to a lot. Oh! We can hack things down and\n build fire and make a shelter. We just dig it out a bit. And we need tinder.\nWe need kindling. I'm a teacher\n and a camp counselor, so I've been\npracticing fire, like, literally every day\n to get my confidence. Just let it grow a little.\nNo, don't-don't snuff it. Just let it grow a little. That's how quick that magnesium\njust goes out. Catch it, catch it,\ncatch it, catch it. All right, all right, all right.\nOh. All right. (Tevin whoops) Fire! Yay. SODA:\nFire means everything out here. And we had a roaring one, honey. We had it roaring flames. How do you think the other\ntribes are doing right now? Do you think they have a fire? RANDEN:\n Who doesn't want fire on\n their first night of Survivor? Clearly, our supplies\n are a big deal. And not having\n to do Sweat or Savvy feels like a million bucks.\nI'm not gonna lie. JELINSKY:\n This is no joke. I'm lucky I got\n Superman on my tribe. Even if we don't get a flint... I got an ally. This is one of the hardest\n things I've ever had to do.\n I honestly don't know if I've done that physical labor in my life. Yes, sir. Let's get it. JELINSKY:\n My feet were getting beat up. I'm looking\n at these urns like, \"Damn. It looked the exact same\n as it did 30 minutes ago.\" There's no way\nwe're filling this. And we were\n working against time. It said that this task\n takes several hours, -but it looks\n like we only have four hours. -You slow down. I know you ain't gonna stop\nfor me, but you better. JELINSKY:\n Last I checked, \"several\" means seven, not four. So I feel like I knew we weren't\n gonna do the damn challenge. ...you don't think\nwe can finish it? I don't. I do. \u266a \u266a Q:\n We still had a couple hours, but with Jelinsky, now I know when the going gets tough, he's going to\n tuck his tail and quit. And in Survivor that's not an option, period.\n If he cannot do this physically and mentally,\nthen we're done. Da d, d on ' t fo rg et ab ou t my n ew c le at s.

Don't overthink it.\nLet's go shopping. Actually what I need\nare some cleats. How about one of these? Great. Done. Anything else? No. Golf clubs? Not for me,\nfor a friend... Yeah, yeah, of course... Anyone impressed with\nhow fast that was? Yeah, totally! I know, I went to Dicks... My cleats!\nThank you! I love you! Wha... I-I went to Dicks.com.\nEver heard of it?

The Savvy was not so savvy. -We were not very savvy\non the Savvy.\n-Yeah. -Let's go rinse.\nYou guys look like...\n-Yeah. It sucks to be like,\n \"Yo, we lost,\" but, I mean, I like\nto look at the world as a glass half full\nkind of vibe. -First and foremost, thank you.\n-Thank you. Yeah. I appreciate the morale. I feel like... -No. No. That's okay.\n-No. I feel like we're all working\non keeping the vibe up. -Yes.\n-And we could be,\nlike, the vibe tribe. -You know what I'm saying?\n-(overlapping chatter) BEN:\n They were like, \"Don't even worry.\nY'all stepped up.\" Which was awesome. So, at this point,\n my strategy's to be myself, which is to just chill hard\n to make everybody laugh. Hi, I'm Ben. OTHERS:\nHi, Ben. I'm an Aries. -Oh!\n-(excited chatter) That's kind of my life. I've played everything from,\nlike, heavy metal to, -like, salsa\nand bar mitzvah music.\n-Yeah. -You know what I'm saying?\n-Oh, fire, bro. A man of many talents here. -I could tell.\n-Listen, you got to be\nopen-minded. TIM:\n Ben is, like, the vibe god. He's, like, the dean of cultural affairs, making sure that the tribe\n is in good spirits. (laughs) You got the vest on. Dude, rock it all you want. -Yeah, there you go.\n-Yeah. -Oh, that's cute.\n-That's not bad. I'm getting Ben's powers here. BEN:\nI like this little workout. We're gonna get ripped. MARIA: I love Ben's energy.\n He has a lot of confidence. And with\nthat confidence, I think he gives us confidence\n in ourselves. JEM:\nThere you go! No. Chug, chug, chug. (screams) JEM:\n I feel like Ben\n is the epitome of Siga. We're surviving. (laughs) That's our thing.\n It's all about the vibe. And I think that's why, like,\n the Siga tribe get along so well. What about you? -We met at bar trivia,\nto be honest.\n-Let's go. Really? Yeah, in such a dorky way.\n(chuckles) I'm this geeky, dorky nerd. Like, I love board games\n like D&D. I do crosswords. I do sudoku. I brew beer on the weekend. I'm aware that I'm a little\n out there, so I am... not everyone's cup of tea. For most of my life,\n I've struggled to make connections\n and to make friends. So I'm looking\n for this opportunity to prove to myself that I'm just not that loner. Like, I can forge a connection. -Oh, okay. There you go.\n-Or when I'm running late,\nMo-on-the-slow. This is my tribe. This is my game. I'm not here to say, like, \"Oh, no, they don't like me.\nI'm done.\" No. I'm here to play my game. I do, too. Yeah. -Yeah, for sure.\n-Do you feel good with me? -Oh.\n-Genuinely? -Yeah. Do you feel good with me?\n-Okay. Yes, absolutely. MORIAH:\nI definitely connected with Jem. I also bonded\n pretty quickly with Maria. Surviving. (chuckles) Who are y'all\ngetting good vibes from? -I think everybody right now,\nto be very honest.\n-Everyone. But we need to maybe\nstart thinking, like, long-term. Especially if we don't want\na woman voted out first. -JEM: Yeah.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. The women came together, so now I believe I have an alliance. I feel strong, and I trust\nwith them, but more importantly, I've made new friends. And it feels incredible. (laughing) Ha! -You got it, coach?\n-Yep. (both grunt) (whoops) He's a he-man. (grunts) (groans) -Yes, sir!\n-(cheering) Am I a good student, coach? -(laughing)\n-Damn good student, man. -Yeah, okay.\n-Okay. -All right, ready?\n-Yeah. (laughing) TIFFANY:\n Maybe I should\n have did the Sweat task. I wouldn't have given up because\nnow we didn't get the supplies. We got to bang a coconut\nup against the side of a rock to just get\n a little bit of juice out. It's hard, like, especially when you don't\nhave any tools. -Yeah. (laughs)\n-Who needs a Sweat challenge when you got beautiful people,\nyou know? (laughing) I'm in the beauty industry.\nI know what I'm talking about. I do hair and I own a salon. Building connections,\n building repertoire is literally\n my bread and butter. Like, this is a fast-moving game, and I am ready to,\nlike, giddyup. Are there three of you? A lot? Oh. Oh, my gosh. (laughs): What?! Q is an amazing,\n hardworking man. I'm like, \"Let's team up.\" -(laughs) I know.\n-(laughs) I got a good vibe from Jelinsky. We literally have\n two matching tattoos. JELINSKY:\nI already thought\nof our alliance name. What is it? Shaggy and Daphne. -(chuckles) You like that?\n-Okay, I love it. Yeah. -This is a sacred bond.\n-But... I agree. So I was like, \"Hey, you and me,\nwe'll work together.\" We pinky promise. I definitely\nwant to be on your side, -'cause I want to work with you.\n-Yeah, yeah. I mean, I want numbers, so...\nAnd I want, like, people I like\nto work with, so... I'm the queen of the tribe right now.\nEverybody's calling me. My phone won't stop ringing. Everybody's like, \"We should work together.\n Let's work together. Let's do this.\"\n Jess is like, \"I get a good vibe.\"\nI'm assuming that's her way of saying\nwe should work together, but I can't tell\n if it's the truth or not. No one's talking to me. I mean, you haven't\nreally talked a lot of strategy. Yeah, I don't know. I'm playing a slow game. KENZIE:\n Jess doesn't really\n want to talk strategy, and no one can get\n a read on her. I tried. I tried talking to her.\nThere wasn't much there. I tried to talk to Jess and\nbe like, \"Who-- What are you-- -Have you talked to anybody?\"\n-Yeah. Literally. It's, like, -she was so hesitant, like...\n-She was like, \"About what?\"\nAnd I was like... Yeah. KENZIE:\n Tiff, that is my girl. We kind of\n have this girls thing, apart from the big thing, that's the four of us-- Q, me, Tiff and Jelinsky. So, we like this. -Uh...\n-We like this a lot. We want to lock this in. -Like, for sure.\n-KENZIE: Yeah, we're good. The four of us\n working together-- wonderful, perfect.\nNumbers. We've got brains,\n we're all strong. Like, we're good. \u266a I'm building me a home \u266a \u266a I'm building me a home \u266a \u266a This earthly house \u266a \u266a I didn't hear that part \u266a SODA:\n\u266a This earthly house \u266a -\u266a And my soul is gonna need \u266a\n-(Tevin laughs) \u266a And my soul is gonna need... \u266a SODA:\n I just love to sing,\n and I love group songs. And I used to lead camp,\n so I feel like Tevin and I singing, like, really brings camaraderie. I think it helps morale. It helps us connect,\n and it helps people feel okay. Yay! (laughs) HUNTER:\n Soda has worked\n as a camp counselor. I also have worked\n as a camp counselor, but one of the things\nthat, like, I didn't enjoy... b-being a camp counselor\nwas camp songs. It's the part of camp\nthat drove me crazy, and it has followed me out here. It goes... \u266a Big booty,\n big booty, big booty, uh-huh \u266a -\u266a Big booty. \u266a\n-(whoops) -HUNTER: My tribe, in terms of energy\nand enthusiasm, we have the most. There's no doubt about that. (both whooping) (chanting):\nLet's go, Hunter, let's go! Let's go, Hunter, let's go! Let's go, Hunter... HUNTER:\n Being from a small town, I don't fit in perfectly,\nbecause I'm very introverted, and there's a lot of energy,\nand I cannot keep up with them. I met my ex-husband. I was like, \"You tall as a tree.\nI want to climb you.\" -SODA: Oh!\n-Oh, damn! -Turn me over.\n-SODA: Hey. HUNTER:\n I've said it coming into this game,\nand I'll continue to say it: it's about being flexible and adaptable,\nand I want to work with someone who can help my social game. I mean really,\nlike, aesthetically, do we want it to be square? Aesthetically.\nLook at you. You're trying to... You're trying\nto flip this house. -(both laugh)\n-Yeah. You're trying\nto flip this house. HUNTER:\n Tevin is a cool guy. We work well together,\n we can laugh together, and it's just, it's really easy\nto have a conversation with him. Tevin, I love\nto hear that you sing. I-I am not\na singer because, like, some people's jokes fall flat. My singing falls flat. If your goal, like, you-you\ncan teach me how to sing... That way I know\nI'll be here a long time. -Okay.\n-(laughs) You're gonna have\nto keep me here a while. TEVIN: Hunter has been humble\n and a hard worker, and the two of us have taken on the leading roles of kind of getting\nthis shelter together. You're obviously\nvery, very good, socially. -We can make it\nworking together.\n-Why, thank you. The Andy Griffith alliance. -The Andy Griffith alliance.\n-(laughing) (\"The Andy Griffith Show Theme\"\nplaying) Hunter and I really do bond because we both\n love Andy Griffith. Oh, my God! I have an alliance\nnamed after Andy Griffith. It's so stupid. I'm an introvert, and so, like, I really enjoy y'all's energy. I just don't have it to match,\nyou know what I'm saying? TEVIN:\n I definitely want to work with\nHunter, but one of my strategies coming into this game was to feel out who everyone is. I really vibe with Hunter. I think he has\n a good spirit about him. -Um...\n-Yeah, he's really sweet\nand, like, calm and easygoing. TEVIN:\n As an actor,\n I'm very extroverted and very good at working\n with people, and that is what Survivor is about. At the end of the day,\n all the world's a stage, and all the men and women\n are merely players. And so I am just on this island playing whatever role\n I got to play. And very soon, everyone is gonna find out\nwhy I say this island's mine. \u266a \u266a I love that song. What was on your mixtape,\nCharlie? Uh, oh, man.\nI'm a big Taylor Swift fan. -Ha! Yes!\n-BEN: Hell yeah. Yeah, T.S. Yeah, I lo...\nI love Taylor Swift. Yeah, I always have. It's real catchy. -I like the lyrics.\n-That's dedication. CHARLIE:\n You know, I've lived\n a very simple life. I grew up in a beautiful town called Manchester-by-the-Sea.\nAnd I loved growing up there,\n but it's a bubble. It's filled with a lot of people\n who look like me. It's not a very diverse place. But out here,\n it's totally different. I've been known to shred\na Long Island iced tea or two. Oh, man. -You're not one of those.\n-You're that guy. (laughing) -Like appletini?\n-JEM: Like tropical drinks? BEN: I'll be honest... -MORIAH: Appletini?\n-(laughing) CHARLIE:\n On Survivor, you've got people\nfrom every single walk of life, every single background,\n and I'm just really excited to learn people's stories\nand, you know, pop that bubble. JEM: The girls came to me\n with this all-girls alliance,\n but I was like, \"We need somebody else. Like, three and three.\nLike, we have to have majority.\" -Charlie's Angels.\n-Oh, my God. (laughs) That is amazing. \u266a \u266a CHARLIE:\n How are you guys feeling? -I feel good.\n-I feel good. -I feel good with everybody.\n-Yeah. -I love the tribe. Yeah.\n-Yeah. MARIA:\nBut, like, the three girls\nreally like you. -That sounds actually\nreally good. (chuckles)\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n I've only had women bosses\n my whole life. In school, in clinics,\nin law school, it's, like, all women. I don't mind\nworking with women at all. And they seem really smart, really game savvy, which I like in an alliance. \u266a \u266a TIM:\n The girls are playing. They're walking, whispering. I mean,\nI'm all about women empowerment, but there's potential\nfor the women to be in cahoots. I have a wife. I have a grandma.\nLike, I know how they operate. I'm telling you, the women\nalways take out the guys. If-if people are playing,\nyou got to play, yeah? -You got to play.\n-You got to play the game. All I'm saying is,\nwe have to take a girl out. CHARLIE:\n This is great. I love this. I got two groups of people who I have an alliance with. But I have to be really careful\n how I handle this, because playing\n both sides is dangerous. Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Oh, girl. \u266a \u266a VENUS:\nWhenever you guys can, like, maybe help me\nsplit the palm fronds, I'll braid all of them for us. When I saw you,\nI called you \"princess.\" -At that moment.\n-I did, too. So funny,\nbut I said, \"Princess U.S.A.\" But you're Canadian, so... VENUS:\nOne of the things I was afraid\nof, coming into this game, was that people\nwould think I'm a princess. I'm anything but. That's right. Don't ever let somebody -tell you\nthat princess is-is bad.\n-LIZ: Amen. VENUS:\n Tevin called me out\n right in front of everyone, saying, \"You are a princess.\" I know I'm on the bottom\nfor that fact alone. But then I thought to myself,\n \"You know what? Screw it. I'll just\n play as hard as I can.\" I'm not gonna go out\nwithout a fight. I have to start being sneaky and looking for advantages\n and finding the immunity idol, 'cause if I can't find it,\n it's my ass going home. Throw a girl a bone, Jeff. I'm desperate. Venus is the goddess of love, but she's married\n to the god of wrath. So when\n I'm being underestimated, you are gonna see me\n become a dangerous player-- someone who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty\n and cause chaos. Aah! Big spider. I'm already envisioning myself at final Tribal Council\n saying \"screw you\" to everyone who underestimated me\n the first day and thought I was some princess who wasn't\ngonna get anything done. I'm not stupid.\n Venus was clearly looking for an advantage or an idol,\n and I caught her. I knew off the bat that Venus was going\nto be the number one threat in my tribe. It's so obvious to me.\n She's very sociable, very charismatic,\n she's dangerous. So I have to make sure that she's exploited as a threat. -RANDEN: Well, I mean...\n-How are you feeling? I'm solid, but my gut tells me that Venus right now is\njust playing super aggressive. -You're afraid of her?\n-Not afraid of her. No, that was the wrong word. -Yeah, I'm not afraid.\n-Wary, wary. But I know a Parvati Light\nwhen I see a Parvati Light. Yeah. If homegirl had a chance,\nI think she would slit a throat at the biggest opportunity. SODA: Randen is telling me to look out for Venus, and I appreciate\n how forward he's being, but my Sodar's going off, like... \u266a Beep, beep, beep,\n beep, beep, ding. \u266a And I have to listen to that, so I don't trust him. I feel like he would,\n in a minute, be like, \"Soda's dangerous,\nSoda's dangerous, Soda's Dangerous,\" to everyone. He really doesn't trust you. -SODA: He's totally using\n your looks against you.\n -Oh. And he said, \"I know a Parvati\nwhen I see one.\" VENUS:\n Parvati was a player who was charming and smart as hell, and she even\n won a million dollars. So, Randen calling me\n a Parvati is a compliment 'cause I love strong women. -That's fine.\n-And he... -That doesn't faze me\nat all, honestly.\n-Exactly. VENUS:\n How dare you\n point fingers at me. Sure, you're correct, but, like,\nhow dare you assume, correctly, that I was being sneaky? I just want to feel...\nYes, quickly. Look out. VENUS:\n Thank God Soda has my back\n a thousand percent. Randen, you just put a giant target\non your back. If you have my name\n in your mouth, you're going home.

It's nice\nto have something to eat. It's nice. A hot meal. The sheer emotion I just felt from eating that one piece\nof coconut is actually wild. That's awesome. I'm Liz Wilcox, and I'm allergic to everything.\n(laughs) Everything edible, anyway. I think I have at least\n a couple dozen allergies. Any and all nuts, cinnamon, avocado, coconut. I'm allergic to chicken. Eggs give me\nincredible brain fog. -SODA: I'm so sorry, Liz.\n-For what? SODA: We really have\nto find you some food. I, like, didn't even think\nabout my reaction. LIZ:\nListen to me. Listen to me. You know, one thing\nyou got to know about Liz is, you don't have to apologize\naround me for being yourself. -Yeah.\n-You know, like,\nthat's just silly.

(all cawing) Having a little somethin'\nsomethin' in your pocket-- that could be really powerful. JELINSKY:\nI did not have to work my tribe at all to go on the journey, and I'm playing Survivor like I'm going to win this game. My mind's on an advantage. You know, I'm not here\n to sit around all day and play nice-nice\n like everybody else. I'm here\n to win a million dollars. -Hello, hello.\n-Oh, my God. Hi! -Jelinsky-- that's it, right?\n-Jelinsky. That's right. And this is where great Survivors are made. This is where\nthe legends are made. Jelinsky is a legend. -Oh, boy.\n-Oh, boy. -Oh.\n-This looks exciting. -Oh, God.\n-Okay. I'm actually gonna pee my pants. -Like, I'm not okay.\n-(laughing)\n-Oh, okay, so we... JELINSKY:\nYeah, let's go ahead\nand flip them over. TEVIN:\n The adrenaline is up\n because the stipulations of the game are as follows. And the person that has\nthe torch symbol is going to reveal\nthat they have that symbol. The other two are then going to try to convince\nthe person who has the torch that one of them\nhas the vote card. The stakes are ridiculous. Your vote is on the line. But whoever's right\n get an extra vote. Oh, spicy. Spicy mami. Okay. MARIA:\n I got the torch. My job is to decipher\n who has the vote card. TEVIN:\n I look at my card. And what do I see?\n The vote card. I get to tell you the truth,\njust about the truth. It's the easiest form\nof acting that exists. JELINSKY:\n And as soon as I saw\n that I picked the skull, I knew that\n I had to lie to Maria. So it becomes a game of deception. Talk to me. Well... Plead your case,\nand then I'll have questions. Well, Maria... I'm not gonna lie to you. I have the vote card. I don't want you\nto make the wrong decision. That's all I got to say. -Maria?\n-Yes. Yes, Tevin? I'm just gonna tell you\nright here, right now, clear as day, that that vote\ncard is right here. -Okay.\n-JELINSKY: I-I promise you,\nthough, like, I have the vote card. I'm not lying to you. TEVIN:\nI would hate for you to lose your vote,\nis what I would hate for, and I'd hate to lose my vote,\nso I'm pleading that you pick this so\nthat we can have an extra vote. 'Cause if you pick that one, my God, today,\nyou might be disappointed. MARIA:\n There's something in my gut that's saying, \"Jelinsky's\n lying,\" but I'm not 100%. So, my heart was pounding\n out of my chest because if I choose wrong,\nthen I'm gonna lose a vote. -All right, so...\n-I'm so sorry. Let's talk about this. If, and you're being honest\nwith me, Tevin, -I'm being 100% honest.\n-then I can trust that we can work together. But Jelinsky, losing my vote\nwould not be good. So, if I find out\nthat you were lying, I will have to go back\nand tell my tribe the deceit. -Ooh.\n-MARIA: So, I'm gonna give you all\nanother chance. You know what?\nI'll-I'll be honest, 'cause I'm not\n\"deceptful\" at all. I-I do have the skull card. Don't pick it. You know, this is\na nerve-wracking thing. So you're saying\nyou have the skull card? I do. I have the skull card. TEVIN:\n Lord have mercy. He literally folded his cards. Jelinsky has, in this moment,\njust given up his vote. But Maria and I get\n an extra vote. -Should we shake hands on it?\n-Shake hands?\n-Shake hands. -Go like this, do it this way?\n-Shake hands?\n-Uh-huh. -I'm sorry I was deceptive.\nI was scared.\n-That's okay. It's because of me\n that Jelinsky totally quit. Like, I felt super\non top of the world. It felt super powerful. JELINSKY:\n Growing up in Las Vegas, you got to know\nwhen to hold 'em, you got to know\nwhen to fold 'em, you got to know\nwhen to walk away. And it was my time\nto fold 'em and walk away. I'd rather lose my vote\n for one Tribal Council than lie to Tevin and Maria and make 12 enemies\n going into the merge. I know, I know, I know. You'd do\nreally great on the show.

(Jelinsky sighs) JELINSKY:\nI will give y'all all the tea. So, we had to play a game. There were three cards. And the torch card\nhad to figure out whether the skull card\nwas lying about what they had. So, of course, I picked the\nskull, which was unfortunate. And at first, I lied to them. That probably lasted a minute and then I was like,\n\"Yeah, I'm lying.\" -TIFFANY: What?! Why?\n-KENZIE: Why? Why do you care what they...? JELINSKY:\nIt was a lose-lose situation. If I lied, they both -would have lost their vote.\n-KENZIE: So? So?\n-So? KENZIE: Jelinsky confessed\n 'cause he didn't want the people on the other tribe\nto lose their vote. Who cares?\n They're not on our tribe. Like, you didn't even\n fight for us? You're supposed to be my number. All you had to do was lie\nto strangers. So you're the only person\nthat lost the vote? Right. And they both\nhave extra votes now. -Okay.\n-It was a bad situation. I felt so bad. I just felt\nobligated to tell the truth. BHANU:\n Jelinsky--\n he gives up too quickly. Are you kidding me? This is Survivor. You cannot give up like that.\nHave you seen Jeff talk to you? You got to dig deep. Hello. CHARLIE: I can't figure out\nwhy Jelinsky would say that. MORIAH: You mom'd the heck\nout of this, man. -Yeah, you did. Yeah.\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:\nAnd so, I will get an extra vote -at the next Tribal Council.\n-TIM: Good job, Maria. -Yeah.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. -Hey!\n-It was fun to do that.\n-CHARLIE: The torch. MARIA:\nOh, my God. -BEN: Yeah, he's crushing it.\n-(Maria laughs) Yeah, I'll try to grow out a\nmullet while I'm out here, too. BEN:\nYeah, exactly. (laughing) TIM:\nMaria's extra vote-- it is scary because I want\n to get one of the ladies out. But now the women can dominate in this game\nand take out the guys. So, this is really, really bad. JESS:\n Since we got here,\n I have no idea if I slept. And last night,\nI went straight to the shelter. When I tried to lie down, lay down... Lied down? Laid down. And that did not go well, either. (wood snapping) -You okay?\n-(laughing)\n-TIFFANY: Hello. -No, I'm good, I'm good.\n-Q: It can hold on its own. I don't think I've slept at all. I'm, like, running on empty.\nI don't sleep at night. Without sleep,\nyou're not gonna be strong. No, and I can't even\nthink straight. I got my ADHD diagnosis\nin the last couple of years, and it's-it's been\n difficult out here. On such little sleep\nand food and water, it's making me kind of...\nIt's making my head spin. And I feel like\n it's, like, affecting me in worse ways than I imagined. Oh, my God.\nI lost my water bottle. -Q: You lost it again?\n-This always happens to me. This is my nightmare,\ncoming out here, is that I would lose my stuff. I'm losing things,\n like, all over the place. My ADHD is, like,\n messing everything up. I feel like I have to kind of\nshrink a little bit and not be as, like...\ntake as much social initiative\n as other people do. That is not a good strategy.\n Like, I need to take\na little bit more initiative. No, and I'm scared to\nbecause of how I am! I would lose them\nin a shopping mall. BHANU:\nOh, no. JESS:\nI am scared to have kids. -BHANU: Oh, man.\n-You can just be,\nlike, one of those -leash moms who has their kids\non a leash.\n-JESS: I know. I need... No, they should\nput me on the leash. (laughing) JESS:\n I have to be going out\n and, like, not be scared to talk strategy to people. I even feel scared to go out idol hunting.\n Oh, my God. If I found an idol,\nI would lose it anyway. BHANU:\n I'm not trying\n to be sketchy, but I'm always looking for an idol. It's extremely stressful because I don't want to be caught. I don't want\nto be caught doing this. (vocalizing) All right. Where are you hiding? And I've been looking\n high and low everywhere. It's super hard. Why-why do they make it look\nso, like, easy? -They make it so easy\non TV, man.\n-Yes. BHANU:\n Everyone's searching\n for an idol, but I don't want anyone\n to find an idol before me. Calm yourself down and think. I'm gonna find that guy.\nI'm gonna find that idol. (whispering):\nI found something. Yo! It's a Beware Advantage. TIFFANY:\n Not for one second\n did it cross my mind to put\n the Beware Advantage back. This is mine.\nI earned it, I found it. I don't care what's in here. I'm doing it or I'll deal\n with the consequences. I didn't come out here to play scared. People who play scared go home. Girl, we got to go back. Where'd you find it? TIFFANY: I read the clue\n real quick, and it says I got to go back to the spot\nwhere I found it and dig a hole. We digging, digging,\n digging, digging. Pull out this big box\n with a lock on it. All right. -Yeah, you did lose your vote.\nYour vote is gone.\n-Okay. -Damn. All right,\nI got to bury it.\n-You got to bury it back. TIFFANY:\n So until I have the idol,\n I can't vote. \"That's why it says beware.\" (laughs) (shrieking):\n Ah! But if we lose\n an immunity challenge, I have to return to that spot.\n There better just be a key waiting there for me\nand not no extra stuff. If we have to tell the boys,\nwe have to tell the boys. -They're are numbers. It's fine.\n-Okay. It's fine. TIFFANY: The more people\n that know about the idol, the more messy it's gonna get. But, I mean,\nit's a Beware Advantage, right? So this is the kind of advantage\n that you kind of need people to be on your side for. I don't have a vote. I found\na Beware Advantage today. -You don't have a vote?\n-I don't. So if Jelinsky loses his vote,\nand I lose my vote, it's y'all two, Jess and Bhanu. -Do not tell Jelinsky.\n-I'm not telling him anything. TIFFANY:\n I don't care\n if I don't have a vote. I'll figure it out. I ain't nervous at all.\nYou can't be nervous. We only got 26 days. Who got time to be nervous?

What happened? -We got rocked.\n-We got rocked. We definitely got rocked. It's just one loss. -Just one loss.\n-Yeah. Yeah. You will have\nyour tribe supplies waiting for you back at camp -after this challenge.\n-(whooping, cheering) All right, Yanu, you had Sweat. How'd that go, Tiffany? Um, I mean, we just\nhaving a good time, Jeff. (laughing)\n-PROBST: So, wait. So, Jelinsky, -you got rocked, too?\n-JELINSKY: Jeff, we read that Sweat task\nand it said it's gonna take several\nhours, and we have four. Last I checked,\nseveral means seven. -Hmm.\n-JELINSKY:\nBut with that being said, we didn't give up until\nan hour and a half into it. Wait a second.\nSeveral means seven? Several means seven.\nIt's a part of the word. -Is it not?\n-SODA: No.\nSeveral is more than... -No.\n-Several is more than a couple. Several means seven in my book. (laughing) Several means seven\nin Jelinsky's book, -and that's that.\n-Okay. PROBST:\nAll right, so you did not\ncomplete the Sweat task, which means you don't have\nyour supplies, either. They'll be waiting for you back\nat camp after this challenge. -BEN: They got rocked.\n-PROBST: All right, shall we get to your first\nimmunity challenge? (all voicing assent) It's going to tax you. You're gonna race\n to the top of a ramp where you will be confronted with the biggest gecko\n you have ever seen. Legs, long tail, bloodshot eyes. You're gonna race\n to untie that gecko. You then got\n to get it over a wall, through a tight tunnel\n and to the top of a deck where two players will then race\n to solve a Survivor puzzle. The first two tribes\nto finish win immunity. This is what\nyou're playing for right here. (cheering, whooping) -All right!\n-Let's go. The immunity idol. -Wow.\n-PROBST: With one of these at your camp,\nit means nobody's going home. -(whooping)\n-Great.\n-Last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers-- Tribal Council tonight\nwhere somebody will be the first person\nvoted out of Survivor 46, and as a penalty for losing, I will take-- or keep--\nyour flint.

(indistinct chatter) PROBST: You're good, Siga!\nYou're good, Yanu! -(overlapping chatter)\n-PROBST: You got six sets\nof knots. Question is which tribe is\ngonna work together the best? And Siga has their knot. Here comes Nami. -Dump it over.\n-Jump!\n-PROBST: Here comes Siga. -(grunting)\n-All right. PROBST:\nHere comes Yanu. Come on. (whoops) (whooping) -We got a challenge.\n-MORIAH: It's okay. Use both, use both hands. PROBST: Everybody and the gecko\ngoes over the wall. (groaning) -BEN: Just two at a time.\n-MARIA: Yeah, everything. Come on, come on, come on.\nNo. Hey. That is 500 pounds\nof Survivor gecko. Ain't nothing easy on Survivor. -(groaning)\n-Push! PROBST:\nAll three tribes\ndoing a nice job, trying to figure out\nhow to maneuver a 15-foot long, 500-pound gecko. -Come on.\n-SODA: Again! Push! Go! PROBST:\nNami-- everybody\ngetting into it. -(groaning)\n-PROBST: Can they get it over? -(indistinct shouting)\n-(Tevin yelling) -Flip it.\n-They've got the gecko. You got to flip it over\nand turn it around. Siga and Yanu\nonce again struggling. -Very familiar.\n-Hey! Let's go, y'all.

(overlapping chatter) PROBST:\nYou are not gonna get it\nby pulling that head. Nice. PROBST:\nYou've got to get on the body. -Yes. Yes.\n-We got to push the body up. -PROBST: It is Nami now\n-HUNTER: Ready? -at the last obstacle\nwith the gecko.\n-One, two, three. (grunting) Great coordination. -(grunting) Yeah.\n-That's how you do it. -Once you can clip it in,\nyou're good.\n-One, -two, three.

PROBST:\nSiga has the gecko over. Let's go.\nWe're looking for two. -You're still in this.\n-Yes! PROBST:\nYou've got\nto get under that body and lift it over the wall. You cannot pull it. Siga now entering the tunnel... -We're almost there, yeah.\n-Pull! PROBST:\n...while Nami works\non the puzzle. Look at that lead.\nLet's use it. Q:\nOne, two, three. Get up. Get up. PROBST:\nYanu starting\nto make some progress. Let's go, Yanu! -(Q shouting)\n-Push! (yelling) PROBST:\nThere it is! Get everybody over. Let's go! Yanu, you got\nto dig deep right now. -You're exhausted.\nThere's no time.\n-All right. -(all grunting)\n-Siga closer.\n-We are right there. Got to get enough of that\nhead up that you can lock it in. Three. -(grunting)\n-Okay, go. PROBST:\nThat should do it. Clip in. Yanu making progress.\nMade up a lot of ground. You are in this,\nbut you cannot rest. RANDEN:\nHell, yeah. -PROBST:\nSoda and Venus for Nami.\n-Look for a number. -Moriah and Maria for Siga.\n-You're solid! There you go, Moriah. Just go, just go, just go! PROBST:\nYanu is through the tunnel. There you go.\nYou are still in this. -(groans)\nPROBST: You got to get it up\nto the top before you can get\non that puzzle. And every second you take\nis a time bleed -for Siga and Nami.\n-(overlapping chatter) -That goes here.\n-I got it. -I have it.\n-You got it. Go.\n-Perfect. -(indistinct shouting)\n-Come on, come on. PROBST: Yanu could be in this\nif they can get it up here. TEVIN:\nIt's all good. Don't panic. -Breathe, breathe.\n-PROBST: Venus and Soda\ndoing a great job -on the puzzle for Nami.\n-Y'all got it. They have been in charge of\nthis challenge from the get-go. -Got it.\n-From the gecko. From the gecko--\nwe see what you did there. -From the get-go!\n-HUNTER: No pun intended. -(grunting)\n-PROBST: Yanu's got it up. -Clip in.\n-Jess, climb up, climb up. You're good, Yanu.\nStart working. -It is Nami\ndecidedly in the lead,\n-Come on, y'all! but Siga does not have\nsuch a big advantage that this is over. Yanu could catch you.\nYou better keep moving. -Yanu, you got a shot.\n-There you go. It's gonna come down\nto Jelinsky and Jess for Yanu and Moriah and Maria for Siga. Soda and Venus clearly\nin control right now. -Two pieces left.\n-Come on, Jeff! -Come on, Jeff.\n-PROBST: One piece left\nfor Nami. For the win. There it is!\nNami wins immunity! -(cheering)\n-We're looking for one more. It's now between Siga and Yanu. Build out the right. PROBST:\nJelinsky's stacking,\nand Jess is putting 'em in. If this strategy works,\nthey can make a fast catch-up. -BEN: Great, Maria.\n-CHARLIE: There you go. Yes. There. Right there. No, up one. -To your right!\n-PROBST:\nJelinsky a little confused. -No. The one you just put down!\n-To your right! (indistinct,\noverlapping chatter) Keep going! Siga with another piece. Jess trying to find another\nfor Yanu. -And she's got it.\n-Beautiful. PROBST:\nIs it too little\ntoo late for Yanu? They took forever\nto get their gecko up here. Jess. Come on, Jess! Jelinsky trying to get one,\ngives it to Jess. -Yes!\n-PROBST: It's not gonna matter. -(shrieking)\n-It's over. Siga wins immunity, joining Nami, safe in the game, sending Yanu to Tribal Council, where somebody\nwill be the first person voted out of Survivor 46. Wow. All right,\nNami, congratulations. (whooping)\nTake it, V. Nobody going home from Nami. Grab your stuff, head out. -Siga, congratulations.\n-(whooping) Well earned.\nGrab your stuff, head out. -Enjoy the night off.\n-Thank you. Bhanu, what's gonna happen\nwhen you get back to camp? 'Cause now it's real. You're\nvoting somebody out tonight. Sorry, Jeff. Um... It's-it's breaking my heart\nthat one of us has to go home, and... it's really hard. We put in a lot of effort\nto be on this, and Survivor means a lot\nto all of us. No one wants to go home, and here we are. I don't know. All right, Yanu, waiting\nback at camp will be your pot and your machete. As a penalty for losing--\nsorry for you-- I'm gonna keep your flint.\nTribal Council tonight where somebody\nwill be the first person voted out of Survivor 46. Grab your stuff. Head out.\nSee you tonight at Tribal. BHANU:\n No one wants\n to be the first person to walk away from Survivor, but this is a game, this is a serious business,\n someone has to go, and I think Jelinsky and Jess\n are targets tonight. But this is Survivor. Anything can happen. The game is on, 24 by seven. It's so hard. Ge ne ra li ze d my as th en ia g ra vi s made my life a lot harder.

In a clinical trial, VYVGART significantly improved most participants' ability to do daily activities when added to their\n current gMG treatment. \u266a\u266a Most participants\n taking VYVGART also had less muscle weakness. And your VYVGART\ntreatment schedule is designed just for you. In a clinical study,\n the most common side effects included urinary\n and respiratory tract infections,\n and headache. VYVGART may increase\n the risk of infection. Tell your doctor if you have\n a history of infections or symptoms of an infection. VYVGART can cause\n allergic reactions. Available as VYVGART\n for IV infusion and also as VYVGART Hytrulo\n for subcutaneous injection. Additional side effects\n for VYVGART Hytrulo may include injection\n site reactions.

There's no stopping in the game of Survivor. We got to vote tonight. We got to make sure\n we're locked in, and I'm going into\n Tribal Council without a vote. But I do feel pretty confident because I feel like\n I have a great alliance with Q, Kenzie and Tiff. We have a solid four. All of my allies\nare locked in with me. I did want to just chill out\nfor a little bit. Really? You think\nthat's better for your game than going where everyone is? (laughs) -How are you feeling?\n-Scared. I'm, like,\none of the smallest people here. Yeah. I mean, I know our names\nare on the block. My name is on the block? I just figured\n'cause we were at the puzzle. I think Jess has\n to be the first one to go. I just wanted to make it seem\n like I'm nervous because I do not want Jess playing\nher Shot in the Dark tonight. And if I could get\n Jess out of here without even casting a vote? Oh, my God. That's Survivor legend status to me. I just want y'all to know\nI don't want any of you going home, period. BHANU:\nWhat is the plan, then? So, the real plan is Jess. The fake plan that\nwe're telling Jess is Jelinsky. TIFFANY:\n People want Jess\n to be the first vote, right? Me included.\n The vibes don't... They not vibing\n when I talk to Jess. And I'm really bummed that we lost the immunity challenge. Psych. I don't care.\nI'm happy we lost the immunity challenge. Now I get further instructions\n for the idol. Okay. TIFFANY: And I needed\n to have my vote back because your vote is your voice in this game. Girl. I got to crack this message\nto find the location of the key. My heart sank. When I opened it up,\nit was a friggin' puzzle. And now I have\n to decode this alien language to figure out where my key is. All right, let's see.\nI think this word is \"the.\" So that means this is T. Maybe this is O. I mean, I love it. I don't know where\nyour brain's at, but beautiful. TIFFANY:\n I am a visual artist, so, doing the puzzle--\n it's just like a friggin' light bulb just\nwent off in my head, and I just started rolling through it. TIFFANY:\n But then, of course,\n here comes Q and Bhanu, curbing the corner. So I knew I had to boogie. I had literally two words left. Oh. Oh. \"Point.\" \"Your key is tied to a rock in the shallow waters\nat the point.\" What is the point? I run over there to the point or what I think is the point,\n and I'm just turning over every rock. Oh. Behind a rock. I'm turning over everything.\n Crabs jumping out at me, all kinds of crap. I'm sweating bullets. (gasps)\nYes! Oh! Yes! Yes! I untied the key,\n and I hauled ass. Oh, my God. (gasps)\nYes! (whispers): Yes! Yes. Yes. I had to work for this. Survivor bucket list item...\nachieved. This is a real, true idol. -No catches. -KENZIE: Whatever you're doing, you have to do it quick. -You got it?\n-Yeah, I got it. -You did?\n-I did. Now, I mean, unless some talks are happening right now\nthat I don't know, it's looking like\n Jess to go home. When you don't deliver\ntime and time again, in my world, you get dismissed. Where I come from,\n hard work is respected. Jelinsky talks a good game,\n but doesn't show up to play. I don't need talkers. I need soldiers who's willing\nto go to battle, do the job. I can't go to war with him. JELINSKY:\nI want our four to go deep. Me too. I mean,\nit's kind of our only option. I think we could\nseriously run things. Q:\n A lot of folks think\n Jess is going home, but I'm writing\n Jelinsky's name down. Big letters. I don't know\nhow to spell it yet, but his name will be\nwritten down, from me, tonight. I cannot have Jelinsky\nto come back. Q: Correct. -And then, Jelinsky,\nI don't trust at all.\n-Correct. JESS: Q's saying\n Jelinsky's the target, but I'm very nervous about tonight.\nNobody wants to be the first person\n voted out and, like, I was a common denominator\n in our puzzle failures. Maybe they're trying to,\n like, butter me up just to vote me out. I think it will benefit us to\nget Jess first, then Jelinsky. Jelinsky has told us he can do\neverything under the moon. So what is he good at?\nHe's weak. I don't know\nif Kenzie's gonna go for voting Jelinsky out first. Maybe we might have\nto think about this. What Tiff is saying\nis also super valid. -Yeah.\n-It's super, super valid. I don't know. I'm so... I'm so torn. I like Jelinsky.\n I like that kid. -I'm a little nervous.\nI'm just...\n-Here. BHANU:\n And I really like Jess. Come here. BHANU: She's the one\n who's consoling me, but I'm gonna\n suck up my emotions, drain my tears, just put the name on the parchment\ntonight and be at peace with it. I mean, Jess was a little better\nat the puzzle today. Jelinsky was looking like a deer\nin the headlights. -BHANU: Yeah, but...\n-KENZIE: But we wouldn't\nhave gotten to the puzzle without Jelinsky.\nWe need to look at the standard of who's gonna\nbe able to carry us, literally, through challenges. Jess is our weakest\nin the physicality realm... That's me, personal. KENZIE:\n Oh, my gosh. It's a mess. We aren't on the same page.\n Like, what should we do? Jess isn't really\n bringing a strength. And sure, she's sweet, but it's really hard\nto work with someone that you can't get a read on. But then, with Jelinsky,\nI don't want to play with people who just give up.\nLike, I'm not gonna give up on anything. Rule number one\n of playing the game-- that one, you don't quit. First Tribal is crucial. Lines get drawn. You know who to trust,\n a lot of stuff gets exposed. And now my brain is, like, hurting. My...

This is part of the ritual\nat Tribal Council because in this game,\nfire represents your life. When your fire's gone,\nso are you. All right, so let's go back\nto the beginning. Jess, what surprised you most\nthese first three days? Oh, man. I think... I... I knew that it would be\nphysically challenging, but more than anything,\nit's the sleep deprivation that is really messing with me and just really\nmessing with my ability to process information. PROBST:\nIs it because you're\nchoosing not to sleep or you just can't\nphysically get... JESS:\nI can't physically sleep,\nand I thought that I would\nbe physically exhausted enough because we've all been\nworking so hard. I thought that I would be\nphysically exhausted enough to just, like,\ngo out like a light, and that's how I usually am\nat home. PROBST:\nI want to circle back\nto the Sweat task because I still have some\nquestions about what happened. Q, walk me through it. Q:\nSo we had to, Jeff, climb up Mount Everest, climb down Mount Everest, go into the ocean\nwith holes in a bucket, and we're like, \"Oh, my. What has Jeff\nput us through now?\" So, we decided to not finish it\nwith maybe about two hours and 45 minutes left. PROBST:\nSo, Jelinsky, I got a slightly different story\nfrom you today. Honestly, Jeff, Q and I\nshare the same mentality. We're the type of dudes\nto not give up on anything. -You know? If...\n-PROBST: Wait a second. That's an impossible statement\nto make given that Q said you just gave up. Okay.\nI see your point, Jeff, but I'm saying if we had all day to fill up that damn bucket,\nwe would have. PROBST:\nJelinsky, what's\nfascinating to me is the reluctance to own\nthat you quit. You're right.\nWe quit the challenge. There's no way around it, and\nI'm gonna own up to it now. We quit the challenge,\nand that's that. Okay, let's move on\nto the journey. Jelinsky, you go\non this journey. -What happened?\n-JELINSKY: Honestly, Jeff, I was so excited to go, but lo and behold, Jelinsky doesn't have\na vote tonight. And Jelinsky has never talked in\nthird person in his life before. -But tonight,\nit especially sucks.\n-Let me... let me step in.\nHe gave his vote away. Again, a different version\nof a story. Q:\nHe gave it away.\nHe traded his vote for them\nto have two extra votes. It's not good in my books. JELINSKY:\nI was in a tough spot. You know, I'm not\na deceptive person, so I realized the cards were\nliterally stacked against me. There was not much I could do. In fact, them having\nextra votes might work to our advantage one day, and\nwe'll just have to wait and see. JESS:\nHow would that work\nto our advantage one day--\nthem having extra votes? They might want\nto work with us and say, \"Hey, you guys vote this way,\nI'm gonna use my extra vote, and we're golden.\" Maybe they're not\ngonna vote you out, but we ain't give them\nthem extra votes. You did. It's a game\nfor a million dollars, Jeff. We're not handing out favors. PROBST:\nAnd, Jess,\nthat's part of the design of a journey. What do you do\nwhen you're alone? -Yeah.\n-Do you make a decision\nthat's good -for the group?\n-Yeah. But... I don't know. (laughing):\nCome back to me in a second. PROBST:\nAre you really struggling -right now?\n-JESS: I am really struggling. Like, my brain is, like,\nsomewhere else right now. Like, and I must have said that\nthe first day, but it's, like,\nreally somewhere else now. I'm like mush mouth.\nI, like... I... I can't even\nstring sentences together. PROBST:\nI'm fascinated by -how open you're...\n-JESS: I'm an alien. I don't\nunderstand myself, either. PROBST:\nAnd, Jess, it happens\nto a lot of players, and it sometimes never goes away. -You just can never catch up.\n-God. -Yeah.\n-So you're struggling\nwith even something as simple -as spelling your name.\n-JESS: Yeah. Don't learn how\nto spell my name, please. (laughing) -PROBST: So, Kenzie?\n-KENZIE: Yes. PROBST:\nWe're only three days in. Where is this tribe right now? KENZIE:\nWell, it's difficult, because we have lost everything\ntogether. We've gone through it all\ntogether. You get super close super quick. And now we have\nto cut someone out. It's... it's tough. PROBST:\nSo, Bhanu, how do you make that first decision\nabout who to send home? (sighs) This is a challenging vote\nfor me. Um, I want to work with someone who's gonna be good socially, not someone who's not giving any clue of what's going on\nin their mind. PROBST:\nHow about for you, Tiffany? TIFFANY:\nFor me, it comes down\nto one thing. What four people can I go back\nto the tribe with that's not gonna put me back\nhere again in a couple of days. -I don't care\nabout nothing else.\n-So you're talking about -tribe strength in challenges?\n-TIFFANY: Yeah. PROBST:\nAnd Jelinsky, that's one of the fundamental dilemmas\nof Survivor, is tribe versus self. JELINSKY:\nOne hundred percent. I\nunderstand what they're saying. I am still 100% into this tribe. Like, I want\nto stay in this game. I just don't want my efforts\nto be lost in a decision like a journey,\nand I will never, ever give up in a challenge. Except for the Sweat test. (laughing) -And the journey.\n-And the journey. (laughing) Thank you for reminding me. (laughing) Jess, given what some\nof the people have said they're looking for\nin a tribemate, are you worried\nthat your inability right now to form sentences-- do you think it's impacting\nyour ability to connect -or do you feel solid?\n-JESS: No. This\nis only happening in, like, public settings, but in my one-on-one or, like,\nsmaller groups, I think I'm a lot more coherent because I do feel like\nI'm delivering at camp and I do feel like I'm\ndelivering at the challenges. Even though I just shouldn't\nhave volunteered for the puzzle. -Yeah. Again.\n-JELINSKY: Jeff, I think Jess and I are definitely\nin the same boat. I feel like a lot\nof the pressure is on us, especially being the common\ndenominators in the puzzle. PROBST:\nJess, he is determined\nto get you -in this boat with him.\n-JESS: I don't want to be in that boat! I feel like\nI worked really, really hard. I do not deserve\nto be in that boat. Jeff, I don't\nhave a vote tonight, so maybe I am\nsubconsciously deflecting. But I love Jess.\nLike, Jess is awesome. -Thank you.\n-You're welcome. -(laughing)\n-I'm a nice guy, man. I don't like fighting. I don't\nlike being the center.... Nobody thinks\nyou're not a nice guy. -We love you.\n-We all think you're a nice guy. -I know.\n-BHANU: Jeff, I love this kid. Like, I...\nThis kid is really awesome. But I don't know\nhow the tribe is feeling. Is it too little, too late? Like, I don't know, so... So you're feeling in your heart\nthat it's Jelinsky tonight? It's time to vote? (laughing) -Oh, ...\n-(laughing) I don't know\nif I'm ready for that, Jeff. TIFFANY:\nHey, yo. -Oh.\n-PROBST: Wow. Jelinsky. That did not sound good. JELINSKY:\nJeff, all I know is, as long as I'm in this game,\nI'm giving 100% effort in every single challenge we do, and I just want us to be\nthe strongest tribe possible going forward. PROBST:\nAll right, it is time to vote.\nKenzie, you're up. Wow. This is so beautiful. Oh, I never want\nto see another gecko again. (sighs) (sighs) Oh, my God. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. All right.\nI'll read the votes. First vote: Jelinsky. Jelinsky.\nThat's two votes Jelinsky. First person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Jelinsky. That's three. That's enough.\nNeed to bring me your torch. Jelinsky, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp.

I knew I had to boogie. (gasps)\nYes. I had to work for this. It's a real true idol. Yes! Survivor bucket list item achieved. Jelinsky's name will be written down from me tonight. BHANU:\nJeff, this kid is really awesome,\nbut is it too little, too late? PROBST:\nSo you're feeling in your heart\nthat it's Jelinsky tonight? It's time to vote? \u266a \u266a First person\nvoted out of Survivor 46: Jelinsky.\nThat's three, that's enough. The tribe has spoken. (birdsong) \u266a \u266a (chanting in foreign language) BHANU:\n The first Tribal Council gives you a perspective, like,\nyou know, who is on your side. We all came to an agreement,\n and we voted to eliminate Jelinsky out of the picture. Even though we all voted the same way, I'm getting nervous, I'm getting paranoid. (chanting continuing) And I feel like\n most of my tribe members-- they are super strategic, and I have to be\nvery careful with them. I know I have it in me.\nI can do this. So, moving forward,\n how can I ensure that, you know, my position's\nstrong in the tribe? Kenz, I need\nto ask you something. I-I can't stop thinking\nabout the game. KENZIE: Really? How... What can I do to... How-how can I work this? Save myself\nto get to the merge? -How do I say it?\n-We have to win. And I'm not confident, man. KENZIE:\n I love Bhanu. I have a sweet spot\n in my soul for him. But Bhanu at Tribal--\nhe's not a good liar. He almost, like, blew it. Aah! KENZIE: He shoots from the hip\n and he's very passionate. So, I can see it being\n a liability down the line that he can't keep what needs to be kept secret\nsecret. We can win a few. Then Jess goes. -Then the four of us go\nto the merge.\n-Hmm. KENZIE:\n One of Jess and Bhanu\n should be the one to go next. So, I'm trying to placate him\nand keep it positive. -We need to win.\n-We need to win. Yeah. Yeah. Despite the fact that,\nyou know, Kenzie is cool -and-and whatever,\n-I know. Well, I know that... -we can't let that be a thing.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -(laughing) -TIFFANY: Kenzie has a very vibrant personality. She's good at making friends,\nshe's good at, like, you know,\n just drawing people in. So, it makes me a little nervous. She knows her best bet\nis to lock in with me and you. I just need to figure out, like,\nhow locked in with me she is. I don't know why\n I get a weird vibe and feeling and, you know... Good smell. (blowing) -TIFFANY: I smell it.\nKENZIE: Fire? You smell that smoke? It's getting hot... but it's nowhere there. Geez. This is a lot harder\nthan I thought it would be. TIFFANY:\n We're kind of\n struggling right now. We're sleeping in the cold every night, no fire. We waking up damp, wet. Aah! TIFFANY:\n And no matter how much blind optimism\n people have, at the end of the day,\nwe are losers. Oh, my God. Ooh! It's hard when you have,\nlike, nothing in your body. I can really tell\n people are starting to feel defeated and people are starting\n to, like, lose their spirit a little bit. It's just tough. It's just hard. I mean, there's just a lot\n going on. Like, I haven't slept,\nI haven't really eaten. It's just so overwhelming because it seems like everything\n is just gonna be easy and perfect\n and you're just gonna, like, get it done. And then you get here\nand you're faced with the reality that, like, being so tired and depleted. And I'm tough. Like, I'm a tough cookie,\n and this is hard. I know I have\nwhat it takes to win, but I think I needed\n to take a second and get my head\n back in the game. I still have to play. At the end of the day,\n you can have human moments, but it's still\n all a part of the game. We're only four days in.\nI've got... I've got 22 left,\nso I've got to get it together. Do my eyes look really blue? Good. (laughs) They always look really blue\nafter I cry. The shining light. If you're gonna cry,\n at least my eyes look good. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a (rhythmic chopping) ...blindfolded. -For a screw.\n-TEVIN: For one screw at the bottom of the ocean. We have covered it\nwith 2,000 nails. -Right. (laughs)\n-You got to... You got to feel for the... First tribe\nto get the screw wins... Air. (laughs) (sighs) TEVIN:\n Right now, I'm feeling\n blessed to be here. My tribe did the damn thing\nin the first immunity challenge. And we won by a lot. The first tribe to win,\nwe don't tear down your shelter. Right. Right now, I'm closest\n to Hunter and Soda, but I'm playing a very\n social game, and I feel like I'm attached to everybody. The only person that I don't\n get a good vibe from is Venus. TEVIN: She's a player. SODA: No. I do think that she is... she is as-as big\nas a threat as people think. I was, like, day one with Venus. Like,\nwe connected on a heart level. But very quickly, I learned\n people don't trust her. And if she's being perceived\n a certain way, and it's lighting off alarms\nin more than one person, I have to distance myself\n from her, even if it's hard. If no one trusts her\nas a number, she's not a number\nto me, either. -Today, probably not, but...\n-Not at all today? I mean, maybe later, later, but I'm really trying\nto grab all my energy -and, like, sit and stuff.\n-Yeah. When it comes to Soda, I had an immediate connection\nwith her. But right now,\n she has her game face on, and I know what's going on. Soda's not dumb, you know? Soda's with the numbers. Tevin-- right now, he's king.\nHe's at the top. Tevin has a deep,\n personal connection with literally everyone but me. So, if the most social butterfly\nis not trying to, like, talk to me in any way,\nthen I'm screwed. This is amazing.\nThank you. Um... Next thing I want to do is\ngo get some vines 'cause I want\nto put our clothing line up, and then I want\nto build the thing for this and work on the fireplace,\nas well. HUNTER:\nOkay. What we need\nto do is just... VENUS:\n Right now, I'm stressed\n because it feels like I'm not even being heard. It's, like, everyone has, like, some kind of connection with\n one another, but I feel like I don't really have a deep\n emotional bond with anyone, and it feels like...\nI'm not even, like, worth... like, I'm not even worth\ntalking to. I feel like people might look\n at me, and they assume things have been handed to me,\n or that I haven't worked hard or struggled in any way. But the truth is that my parents\nimmigrated from Iran to Canada. They realized that as the government was becoming\n more and more oppressive, that this was no place\n to raise a young woman. And from childhood,\n I've tried to show just how capable\n and strong Persian women are. So, my whole life, it's, like,\nI don't want to be seen as weak. Like, I need\nto be this, like, tough badass. Like, I can't let people\n see me struggle. And so, in this game, I'm going in\nwith that same mentality, and it's kind of biting me\nin the ass because people want\n to see that vulnerability. They want to be able\nto connect with you emotionally, and I'm struggling\n to do that right now. It hurts on a social\n and, like, personal level to see that no one's even trying\n to make an effort to acknowledge your existence. And I don't know what to do. Makes you feel like there's something wrong\nwith you. And, like,\nI can't be anyone but myself. Wi th s o ma ny c ho ic es on B oo ki ng .c om there are so many\nTina Feys I could be.

Can't start a fire\nwithout a spark. Being the first to light fire\nis totally on the bucket list. -MORIAH: You're gonna do it.\n-MARIA: There we go. There we go. We got it. We got\nit. We got it. We got it. (cheering) We lit fire, baby! Oh, yeah! BEN:\n So I'm just sitting there\n with the flint, going hard at it,\n and I got it, and I lit fire. And I felt higher\nthan rocking a sick show. You did it, Ben. My man! BEN:\n I'm crying thinking\n about fire. Like, I didn't even cry\nover meeting Nicolas Cage. -High five, buddy. You did it.\n-Bring it in, dude.\n-Dude. BEN:\n I was always the kid\n with so much energy. Teachers couldn't handle me. You know,\nI haven't been the sharpest tool in the shred my whole life,\nyou know? I had a stutter\n and I had a lisp. So, like, I was bullied. But I remember my dad\n had a guitar in his closet. I found it. The power of rock-- the thing that helped me\n overcome my insecurities. I've played shows\n all over the world. I played big festivals, and I did so many things that, like,\nI think I blew my own mind. -Good job, Ben.\n-Thanks, dudes. -Dude, you crushed.\n-You kept at it. BEN:\n But in my head,\n I feel like I am, like, still a little, insecure kid. Who I am has always been in me,\nbut I haven't trusted it. I don't know why I'm crying.\nI'm just, like, so hyped. (laughing) BEN:\n For me, it was so important\n to get fire because it was so out of my element\n and comfort zone. Makes you feel like\nyou could do anything. -MARIA: Ben, you know\nwho's proud of you?\n-Who? MARIA:\nEverybody. (all cheering) TIM: As a tribe, we're communicating\nin a healthy way. I think\nit wouldn't hurt to throw in just a few pieces of husk. TIM:\n Even individually,\n I'm in a good place. I got Charlie and Ben. MORIAH:\nHere. I'm gonna... MARIA:\nGo over there to get the water? TIM:\n We know that Maria has a benefit right now. TIM:\n Maria went on a journey\n and she has an extra vote and it's a big deal. We know that Maria\nhas the extra vote. BEN:\nI think somebody's gonna\nhave to approach Maria. I feel like Tim's got a\ngood connection going with her. TIM:\nThe goal we all should have\nin common is Maria. Yeah. CHARLIE:\nSo if we could pull her in, then -we've got four.\n-BEN: Yeah. And, like, she might have\nan extra vote, too, so... The way that it's going is Tim and Ben... and then me, and they want\n to work with Maria. -Just maybe for, like,\na minute, you know...\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n And then you have\n the three women and myself-- \"Charlie's Angels.\" MORIAH:\nI do want to say, like, I think it's really important\nto, like, solidify -and talk about this now.\n-Yeah.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's trying\n to count to four. The Angels and Charlie-- that's four. But that leaves me\non the bottom. If we lose three times,\nit's just the Angels. And so, I feel a little bit,\n you know, dancing without a partner\n out here, you know? It's just me on the dance floor,\n and I want to-I want to waltz with someone.\nI want to tango with someone. You know, that's what I want\nto do out here. I want to have a ride-or-die. And it seems like Maria and I have built bonds\n with both sides. So, if there's someone out here\nthat I feel like would be a good alliance partner\nfor me, it would be Maria. CHARLIE: So it's, like... The ladies and me,\nwhich I friggin' love. -Yeah, I love that, too.\n-I love it. But the thing is is, like,\nwe need strength, obviously. -Like, we need some strong...\n-People? Maria and I might be\n the two best buds, you know, that pair that can decide\nthe direction of the tribe. In any alliance,\nthere has to be sub-alliances. -Right?\n-Yeah, and, uh... Which is dirty to think about,\nbut, like, there has to be. But it's-it's...\nit's just a fact of the game. And, like, my favorite players\nare Malcolm and Denise. -Yeah. Malcolm and Denise.\n-Like, I'm a... -I'm like a ride-or-die player.\n-You like... Denise is one of my favorites. And it's gonna be us two. Cool? I... We're gonna do this. I feel like I could emulate her because she's kind of, like,\nthat strong... that strong mom. Yeah. You're a stronger mom.\nI can tell. MARIA:\n I like the idea\n of working with Charlie. You know, this reminds me a lot\nlike Malcolm and Denise. -And if we just\nkeep our options open,\n-Yeah. -like, we don't have\nto make any decisions right now.\n-Yeah. At this point,\n we could go either way with Moriah and Jem\n or with Ben and Tim. So it kind of was\nexciting for me to think that, well,\nmaybe the two of us could be the decision-makers\nworking together. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yup. VENUS:\n I'm not blind. I see that I'm on the bottom, and it all comes back to Tevin. It doesn't matter\n how hard I try. He has too many links\nwith too many people, and there's nothing\n I can possibly do to compete with those. So I want to double down\n on finding that idol in order to actually ensure some\nkind of backup safety for myself and turn the tides to throw\nthe votes on someone else. So, I need to find this idol\n and I need to find it quick. My feeling is that I'm up on the chopping block\nor Venus. So if I can get an idol, that\nwill save me, that would be big. HUNTER: I guess it's something\n about being Southern or something about just wanting\n to collect firewood, but I've played it really well\nbecause they all think I'm just, you know,\nthe happy-go-lucky country guy who's just having a good time\nout here camping. But the reality is\n I'm here to play hard. I'm the only one going out and getting a substantial amount\n of firewood, so why not just look around? I know the trails, I know\n interesting-looking trees, and so, I'm pretty confident\nthat I'm gonna find this thing. Ooh. Ooh! Snap. What is this? Oh.\nA Beware Advantage? So I see a parchment paper sticking out of a tree, and I pull it out\nand it says \"Beware.\" I didn't come to Survivor to... not take risks, so we're gonna open it\nand see what it says. Well, Beware Advantage is here.\nDig down. Oh, my God. So, I open up\n the Beware Advantage and it tells me to dig right\n beneath where this note is. And I'm digging, digging,\ndigging, digging. And I hit a box. Oh, my God. What is this? I'm super excited\n and I go to open it up and there's a lock on it. I was like,\n\"Oh, why is there a lock?\" Then I realized that the box\n has, like, a little tube, and then there's a note\nin there. Oh, my God. It's complicated. That's why it's... This Beware Advantage is\n very different from anything I've seen\n because the stipulation on the Beware Advantage is\n you have to lose to retrieve\n further instructions. So, if we continue to win,\nI'm still safe. If we do lose, then I am gonna\n go into scramble mode because if I don't find it before\nTribal Council, I'm useless. I don't have no vote. It's nerve-racking\n because you see this Ferrari in your driveway, but you have\n no gas, you have no key. I basically have a useless car\nthat you can't drive. An idol is, like, everything to\nme, but I have to work for it. Survivor, man. You ain't make it easy\nfor a brother. \u266a \u266a Q: Right. -TIFFANY: So why you doing it?\n-Q: For the protein. TIFFANY:\nGirl, the amount of protein you getting\nfrom them little ants... JESS: Yeah. TIFFANY:\n Jess is a little weird, a little quirky and out there, but she's such a nice person. I think she's just\na little socially awkward. -(laughs) -JESS: In my tribe, I'm going up against some\n very strong personalities, and I thought that I would be\nthis kind of social butterfly. But I don't know-- maybe I've been\n a little bit more reserved than my normal self. That's why I eat the ants-- so I don't have to talk. BHANU:\n So, -you're recently married?\n-JESS: Yeah. We'd been together\nfor seven years or something when we got married. BHANU:\nDid you meet him in Canada? No, I met him outside a bar\nin Hong Kong. He's from St. Louis. BHANU:\nThis is... this crazy,\nyour story. TIFFANY:\nThat's what I said. BHANU:\nUm, I can't put all\nthese puzzle pieces together. I'm a puzzle.\nNo, I'm not. I feel like\n people don't really know what I'm like inside,\n but I've come to realize that it doesn't really matter\n what they think. I have a family that loves me,\n a husband that loves me, and that's what's important. But right now, my strategy\nis not to be the person on the outs, so, I'm making more of an effort\n to get them to know me. -How do you say \"hello\"?\n-JESS: Something... -Ni hao. -Q: Ni hao. -TIFFANY: Ni hao. -BHANU: How about \"thank you\"? -Xiexie. -What is, \"xiexie ni\"?\n -\"Ni\" is \"you.\" -So it's like, \"Xiexie...\" -Yeah. -How do you know that? -Rush Hour, baby. -JESS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\n-Oh, my God. Q: It's a movie\nwith Jackie Chan in it. KENZIE: The situation\n as it stands right now is that Q, Tiff and I-- we have the numbers right now.\nWe have three. -Do you want me\nto come with you?\n-BHANU: Yeah. Let's go. KENZIE:\n But here's the thing. Q and Tiff both\n are strong players. -JESS: You went inside the cave?\n-KENZIE: Yeah. I'll show you the way. And part of my job as a stylist\n is building connections. So, the best thing for my game\n is being friends with everyone and keeping my options open\n because, eventually, big moves have to be made. -BHANU: Wow.\nKENZIE: Like,\nisn't this amazing? BHANU:\nThis is-this is gorgeous. How I wish this was,\nuh, the last day. KENZIE: Yeah. -I mean,\nwe can pull off anything.\n-JESS: Yeah. KENZIE:\nI mean, we have to kind of\nsee how the challenge goes. -JESS: Yeah.\n-Like, I want to win. But I also want to, like,\nnot discount any options. And then just, like,\nscrap our way through? It's either them or us,\nyou know? I kind of tossed some bait out there to see if I could\n work with Jess and Bhanu on a possible blindside, and I didn't really get much. What do you think? -I need to think more\nabout what I think.\n-Okay. I don't think Jess or Bhanu\n are very strategic players and I don't want\n to have to hold people's hands through this game. You can't go to Tiff and Q and\ntalk about this conversation. -JESS: Yeah. Yeah.\n-KENZIE: They will freak out. -I'm not gonna say that.\n-Okay, good. JESS:\n That was actually\n the first time that I talked strategy with Kenzie\nin a meaningful way. And she's playing\n really, really hard. KENZIE:\nEvery... We're all\nstirring the pot. We're all stirring\nthe same pot. We're all stirring the same pot. JESS:\n I honestly can't tell\n if she's for real because she can look at you\n and make you feel like you're her best friend, so, Kenzie is playing a great social\n game, and that's dangerous. So at this point, my plan is to blindside Kenzie. Q: Jess threw Kenzie\n under the bus by saying, \"Kenzie threw out 'we should\n get rid of strength.'\" If Kenzie's supposed to be in my alliance of three, she shouldn't have said that. It'll all work out. Trust me. Right now,\n I think Jess is trying to come up with a solution to get the target off her back. She felt some heat\nlast night at Tribal. -If we vote together,\nwe both will be here.\n-Yeah. Q:\n But now I'm thinking,\n can I trust Kenzie? He re a t Pa pa J oh ns , we k no w ou r st uf f!

All right, so, Charlie's Tarzan, Maria's Lieutenant Mom,\nMo's Mochete. -(laughing)\n-Ooh. -I'm Benevolence.\n-Water. -Jungle Jem!\n-MARIA: Ah! Jungle Jem! We got 'em! (laughing):\nYeah. I knew coming out into this game\n that strategy-wise, I'll be good,\n but a weakness of mine is the social game. -MARIA: That's a lot.\n-JEM: I don't need\nhis validation. Okay, we're good.\nLet's pop this in. But I think\n it's just so important to connect with people\n out here, and I'm going to have to\n figure out a way. So, I'm a massive Taylor Swift fan, and I love Star Wars\n and Harry Potter and all these nerdy things. So, anytime I can sort of\nbe spouting all... any sort of stuff like that\nand... and just showing people what I like and who I am,\nthat's what I want to do. Whoever runs out -of songs first loses.\n-MORIAH: From one artist. CHARLIE:\nWhat you got, Ben? I'd go with, uh... -I'd go with Metallica.\n-CHARLIE: Metallica? Greatest metal band of all time. Yeah. CHARLIE:\n I've been getting to know Ben really well.\nHe's, like, a music savant.\n So I was like, \"I'm gonna put\n my Taylor Swift knowledge head-to-head against\nBen's Metallica knowledge.\" -Metallica versus T. Swift,\nCharlie versus Ben?\n-Yeah. -You ready?\n-Okay, go. \"All of the Girls\nYou Loved Before.\" -\"My Apocalypse.\"\n-\"The Best Day.\" -BEN: \"Seek & Destroy.\"\n-CHARLIE: \"You Belong with Me.\" -\"Jump in the Fire.\n-\"Should've Said No.\" \"Motorbreath.\" \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\"\nabout Joe Jonas. -Ooh.\n-They're cool now, though. -(laughing) -BEN: What a stupid way\n to pass time. And if I had done that\n in any other setting, everybody around me would be like, \"Ben, shut up.\" But here, everybody was like,\n\"Yo, they're going for it.\" -\"Dyers Eve.\"\n-\"Gorgeous.\" -\"Enter Sandman.\"\n-(laughing) -\"Delicate.\"\n-\"Sad But True.\" \"This is Why\nWe Can't Have Nice Things.\" -\"Holier Than Thou.\"\n-(laughing) -\"I Did Something Bad.\"\n-\"The Unforgiven.\" MORIAH: I'm living\n in a universe right now where I am wildly entertained by just two guys just\nsaying names back and forth. -\"The Struggle Within.\"\n-\"Clean.\" -\"Ain't My Bitch.\"\n-(laughing) -Facts: It's a Metallica song.\n-CHARLIE: I ain't your bitch. It's a grueling battle, back and forth,\none after another. BEN:\nAll right, onto the next album. \"Some Kind of Monster.\" \"We are Never Ever\nGetting Back Together.\" Like, ever. -\"The House That Jack Built.\"\n-\"All Too Well.\" -\"Until It Sleeps.\"\n-\"All Too Well,\"\nten-minute version. Ooh. Okay, well, we have that\non this album. Don't worry. (laughing) TIM:\n It's, like, name after name. And, like, yo,\n y'all at least named, like, 75 songs each, yo. So we're getting into the albums\nI'm not very into, -but I still got 'em in my mind.\n-CHARLIE: Ooh, yeah, let's go. -Come on!\n-BEN: I've still got 'em. JEM: I've never listened to a single song of Metallica's. Wait. There's the Metallica\nalbum with Lou Reed, which is really terrible. JEM:\n At some point, I'm like, \"Are we done? Like, is this it?\" BEN:\nI'm just thinking on this album.\nI got more. Okay, here we go.\n\"Creeping Death.\" A song about Passover. Uh, \"Coney Island.\" \"2 X 4\" \"You're Not Sorry.\" Damn. All right. How many more you got? A lot. BEN:\nMan, if I only knew the\nreally bad albums a little more. (laughing) I don't believe\nin any bad Taylor Swift albums. BEN:\n Listen, there's a bit of\n an unfair advantage, because although I love Metallica, I'm not a stan\nfor terrible albums. Dude, I think I got to tap out. It's not right. Well, Ben,\nthis has been the great war. -TIM: Great job.\n-Which is... which is... We can... We'll go round two\nwith another band. -Which is another\nTaylor Swift song.\n-Oh. Dead. CHARLIE: I was pretty impressed\n with both of us just being able\nto recall so many songs, and it was just fun. It was pure, pure fun. And doing things like that, I think it just\n endears you to people. We easily named a hundred songs. Yeah, we... we went hard. Yeah. Charlie is an adorable goofball, and I love him for it. I am having the most fun out here, you know.\n It's, like, I would say, even\nif I ever did Survivor again, I don't think the experience\nwould be this dope, 'cause it's these people that are making it\nso enjoyable for me. \u266a \u266a So, I don't know if you said,\nLiz, but did you ever say that you would, like, remarry? Maybe. I cannot imagine the person that would marry Liz. -Oh.\n-I don't mean this any type of way,\nbut there is a special type of... man\nwho can deal with someone making so much money\nand not actually needing them. Wow. LIZ: I own my own company.\nI'm an online entrepreneur, and I've pushed myself so hard\nbecause I came from nothing. And honestly, I came into this game wanting the title. I don't need the money. The money would better my life, but it wouldn't change my life. And so, winning this game is\n going to show my daughter and my family that, \"Wow, Liz\nreally can do anything. Maybe I can do something similar\n one day.\" That's the most important thing. TEVIN: I think that\nthere's plenty of men out there who would want to be with Liz. -That's for your...\nyour first comment.\n-SODA: Agreed. TEVIN:\nSo, whether you're looking\nat a range of men now... -Well, they want to,\nbut can they?\n-TEVIN: Ooh. Everybody wants to be with Liz.\nTrust me. TEVIN:\nOh. You trust lady luck. RANDEN:\n I just don't understand what kind of game\n Liz is playing. Nobody knows who Liz is.\n Liz wears rainbows. She's a CEO of five companies. She teaches everybody\n how to make a million dollars. So, it's-it's crazy. Have you had any conversations\nwith her? Like, real ones? Yeah, a little bit. Well,\nthe problem with Liz is that she's like a... It's like\n talking to a billboard. You know what I mean?\nIt's kind of like, you know, -she's telling you...\n-She's got a phrase\nfor everything? Yeah. \"I'm like a CEO,\nI'm a company.\" And she's like, \"Well, I'm too good to do this.\"\nAnd whatever. At this point,\n I have to make a decision. I have this amazing\n Beware Advantage. I'm very excited because if I complete\nthe Beware Advantage, I have an idol in my pocket. The problem is, for me to stay in the game longer\n and make big moves, I just feel as if, like,\n I need one person to trust on this island, and that's the biggest issue\n I have in my tribe. I don't really trust anybody. -Good talking. -RANDEN: Soda and Hunter are close to Tevin. -I just chugged this. Like...\n-You need them electrolytes. It was full. RANDEN:\n And then Liz-- there's too many\ninconsistencies. Like, I do a lot\nof podcast interviews. I've done, like, 300 in the last -Yeah?\n-two years or something. RANDEN:\n I don't know. Something's not up\n with that story. But that's just me. It could be Survivor kind of paranoia. Venus, I think, in my opinion, she's the ultimate liar\n in this game. -If I go off,\nand you see me, like,\n-Yeah. -by the water, I'm just, like...\n-Chilling. -I'm just chilling. Like,\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not, like, looking around. RANDEN:\n So, I don't have many options. But at the end of the day,\n I made a decision and I said, \"I'm going to trust\nthe one person \"I originally thought\nnot to trust, and if it fails,\nthen that's on me.\" -Okay. -RANDEN: weirdly enough, the person I shouldn't\n be comfortable with-- I'm actually comfortable\n with Venus. I shouldn't be, though.\n She's young, she's ambitious, and I just feel\n like she will cut my throat. But I came to Survivor to gamble and risk. So... I did it. I told her. VENUS:\n So, Randen tells me\n that he finds himself a Beware Advantage. And the moment I heard it,\nI became, like, a statue. I couldn't process\nwhat he was saying 'cause I was equal parts\nexcited, equal parts pissed\nthat it didn't happen to me. My whole thing is, like,\nI want to use your gifts and my gifts\nto get further in the game. You know what I mean? Like, \"I'm like, damn,\nlike, there really is... I can't catch a damn break.\" And you're my break.\nGod bless you. I really thought that\n my life in this game is over. And within the span\nof just one day, everything has changed. All of a sudden, I have an advantage I could\npotentially use to my favor, a rock solid-alliance. So, it does a lot to...\nbreathe some life in my game. You know?\nI'm-I'm feeling pumped. \u266a \u266a Come on in! -Good morning, Siga.\n-Good morning, Jeff. -(chuckles)\n-Hi. PROBST:\nGood morning, Nami. Good morning. \u266a \u266a Siga and Nami,\ngetting your first look at the new Yanu tribe. Jelinsky voted out -at the first Tribal Council.\n-Ooh. -RANDEN: Wow.\n-PROBST: Wow. Massive reactions. -Wow.\n-Whoa. -Wow.\n-Legendary. -Last name, first out.\n-Oh. -Oh!\n-Oh!\n-Oh! -HUNTER:\nI said last name, first out.\n-Oh, my gosh. I guess, were there\nseveral reasons -you guys voted him, or...\n-(laughing) KENZIE:\nThere-there was, uh,\nmore than several. There was more than seven.\nWe'll say that. -Wow.\n-SODA: Oh, my God. The jokes keep coming, right? PROBST:\nSo, Q, obviously, it's not fun for Yanu to go\nto Tribal and vote somebody out, but it is a game\nand you're down somebody. And clearly, these two other\ntribes are taking a little joy in talking and joking\nabout who it was and why they were voted out. How does that feel? Well, right now, Jeff, in this game,\nwe're the laughingstock, and their six has been better\nthan our six. Right now we're down to five and we'll see if their five\nis better than ours. PROBST:\nSoda, he's slinging it\nright back at you. Make fun all you want.\nLet's go. I could catch it.\nIt's fine, and I like it. You're gonna see five\nand five. Here we go. (laughing) He did it first. BHANU:\nJeff, let me tell you one thing. I'm from India.\nAnd we want freedom. Gandhi was on a hunger strike\nand he won freedom for India. Hunger is not closest to my mind. What we are hungry for\nis the challenge and to win that idol today. Mm. -Fire.\n-PROBST: All right, well, let's get to today's\nimmunity challenge. First things first.\nGot to take back the idols. Later, Frodo. -Bye, Frodo.\n-Bye, Frodo.\n-Thank you. Thank you. All right. This is cute. Hey, he's part\nof the Nami tribe now, so we had to make sure\nhe had his own Buff. -PROBST: Oh, nice.\n-Ooh. Fortunately, I always carry\na little knife of my own. -No!\n-(all voicing dissent) Jeff. -SODA: I told you\nhe wouldn't let that slide.\n-Yeah. -That's hard-core.\n-I've been knew that.\nI'm not surprised. You don't own this idol, Nami.\nYou got to win this idol. -Hey, Jeff.\n-Ooh. Scorpio energy right there. Thank you, Jeff. Your hat is orange, though,\nJeff, so thank you. (laughing) Wow. All right, shall we get\nto today's challenge? -Yeah.\n-Yeah, let's do it. PROBST:\n For today's challenge, one person from each tribe\n is gonna race to release a machete, you're gonna chop a rope\n and drop two wheels. You'll put those wheels\n on your cart. You'll then dig up two chests, put the chest on your cart. You'll then push your cart\n through the course, moving obstacles along the way. When you get to the end, you'll\nuse the pieces inside the chest to form a massive Survivor arch puzzle. First two tribes\nto finish win immunity, safe from the vote.\nYou're not going home. In addition,\nyou're playing for reward. Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? (all voicing assent) -We ready.\n-PROBST: First tribe to finish, this will change everything. (cheering) Oh, my God. Hooks. PROBST:\nA massive Survivor fishing kit. MORIAH:\nOh, my God. PROBST:\nSecond tribe to finish-- not as extensive,\nbut it'll get it done. Mask, snorkel, fins,\nHawaiian sling. Last tribe to finish,\notherwise known as the losers, Tribal Council,\nwhere somebody will be the second person voted out,\nand as a penalty for losing, I will take your flint.\nYanu, you're still trying to earn yours for the\nfirst time. All right, sit-outs. Siga, you have one person\nyou're gonna sit out. Who's it gonna be? I'll sit out, but I want\nfirst go with the fishing gear. -You got it, Mo.\n-PROBST: Moriah gonna sit out\nfor Siga. Nami, one extra person.\nWho's gonna sit out? -The one and only Liz.\n-All right, Liz gonna sit out for Nami. Sit-outs,\ntake a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give\na minute to strategize. We'll get it on. Let's do it! All right, here we go.\nFor immunity and reward.\nSurvivors ready? Go! It's gonna be Hunter,\nJem and Q on the machete. You've got to unthread that rope\nto release your machete, then chop the ropes\nto release your wheels. Hunter has his machete. He drops his wheels. -MARIA: Jem!\n-Make them wheels fall. PROBST:\nJem has hers. And she drops her wheels. (whoops)\nGo, Jem! -TIFFANY: Come on, Q!\n-PROBST: Q has his. And two, three. (groaning) -He drops his wheels.\n-Come on, let's go! (overlapping chatter) -One, two, three.\n-One, two, three. -MORIAH: Let's go! Let's go!\n-Okay. MORIAH:\nGo, Siga! You're running. Now you got to get the wheels\nonto your cart. Make sure you get that cotter\npin in so those wheels stay on. -Go, Jem.\n-Let's go. Let's go.\n-One, two, three. Go. PROBST:\nIt's gonna be Nami, then Siga. PROBST:\nYanu once again in last. And they're on the move. Keep going,\nkeep going, keep going! PROBST:\nYou're good, Siga. You're good, Nami.\nStart digging up your chest. LIZ:\nGo, Nami! You're good, Yanu.\nStart digging. Got a handle. PROBST:\nEverybody on the chest. You got to get 'em\nonto your cart before you can continue. (grunting) So you got that? Once again, it is a challenge that requires effort\nand communication. We got the handle, we got it. Here they come.\nWe need help with this. Nami has their first chest. Dig, dig some more. PROBST:\nYanu working\non their first chest. Get the handle, Bhanu. PROBST:\nIt is Nami in a familiar spot:\nthe lead. Yanu has their first chest. (grunting) -PROBST: There you go.\n-(grunting) Right. Siga now working\non their first chest. -What's your name again?\n-Mo, I go by. You? -Mo? I'm Liz.\n-Yeah. Nice to meet you, Liz. -Nice to meet you.\n-Oh, man. (overlapping chatter) -These chests are heavy.\n-MORIAH: Come on, you guys! PROBST:\nNow that cart's got\na lot of weight. It's Nami in the lead. LIZ:\nCome on, Hunter! -Tevin!\n-You're good. Start clearing out\nthe obstacles. We keep pushing. I got it. Come on. Here comes Yanu working\non that second chest. All right, it's Tiffany,\nBhanu and Q. We got Tim, Jem,\nCharlie, Ben and Maria. Everybody for Siga working together\nto get that chest on their cart. Also, I love your glasses,\nby the way. -Thank you. I love your socks.\n-Thank you. -Come on. Everybody.\n-Everybody push. Everybody push. -There goes Yanu on the move.\n-Yeah. Push. (overlapping chatter) Now Siga picking it up. It is Nami still in the lead. Now get the barrel away. Pick\nit up. Like, move it, move it. Nami gonna use everybody\nto clear out the entire course,\ndo it in one shot. (overlapping chatter) You're good.\nStart clearing your obstacles. You're good, Siga.\nStart clearing those obstacles. You got to get\nall those obstacles out of the way\nso your cart will get through. -Here comes Nami.\n-Left, left, left, left, -left, left, left, left, left.\n-Watch your hands. PROBST: They're gonna be first\nto the finish. Tight fit. You got to get here. -RANDEN: Turn. Go.\n-Turn right here.\n-Go. -LIZ: \u266a Nami, Nami... \u266a\n-PROBST: You're good. Get your chest, now, in here. \u266a Nami, Nami, Nami... \u266a PROBST:\nThere comes Siga now. They're heading\nthrough the course. Back up. Go, go, go, go, go, go.\nYou got it. LIZ:\n\u266a Nami, Nami, Nami... \u266a TIFFANY:\nDon't turn yet. Don't turn yet.\nNow turn. -PROBST: You're good.\n-Come on. Go. Come on, come on. TIM:\nEverybody, get ready. PROBST:\nYou're good. Get the chest in here. JESS:\nLet's go. (grunting) PROBST:\nNami now can start\nsolving their puzzle. (overlapping chatter) Yanu's cart is in the way.\nCan they get it in? You're good. Untie. -Come on, go. All right.\n-Go. PROBST:\nYanu has their pieces out. Everybody\nworking on the puzzle now. Let's pull all the black letters\nout. Black letters. PROBST:\nFirst, you're trying to figure\nout what to do with the letters. MORIAH:\nWell-oiled victory! Then you're gonna\nbuild an arching puzzle... CHARLIE:\nMaybe like that. ...that will be freestanding\nwhen you're done. \"Inspire\"? No, there's a \"C.\" PROBST:\nFirst, you got to figure out\nwhat is the word you're looking for. This requires\ncommunication and teamwork and a bit of a vocabulary. The white letters this way. PROBST:\nIt will spell the same thing on both sides--\nyour side and my side. It has to be same\nfront and back, you guys. -So the last letter, the last\nletter has to be on the back.\n-Okay. Nami thinks they know the word. Nami undefeated this season. -That's right, yeah.\n-On this side. TIM:\nI got you, Jem. PROBST:\nCommunication is key. You've got five people\nthat have to work together. Siga thinks\nthey have an idea now. Yanu now looking next door. This is as much about building\nthe puzzle as solving the word. -(grunts)\n-It's gonna fall. PROBST:\nSiga starting to see that now, as those pieces fall on Tim. Siga loses everything. Those blocks are very heavy. That'll break a toe,\nscrape up a face. -SODA: Go, go, go, go...\n-You've got to work together. Panic does not help. SODA:\nMy arms are, like, really -not doing well.\n-PROBST: You've got to get it\nto stand on its own. Once you do,\nget back to your mat. Immunity is yours. Yanu is taking\nan insane amount of time. No. All right.\nBring that, bring that. -Stay there, Ben.\n-I'm here, I'm here. Last letter. -Last letter.\n-Siga drops again. Opening the door now for Yanu. TIM:\nWe're right there.\nWe're right there. Hold it. -That R. That R.\n-Come on. Bring me that R.\nBring me that R. Here. PROBST:\nThat word's got to be right\non both sides. When you have it\nand it'll stand, get to your mat for the win. Yanu now is in on this. -Tiffany can't hold 'em all.\n-SODA: Randen, help him. -I-I got...\n-You got to... -I can't.\n-Come on. -Oh.\n-Oh, my God. PROBST:\nNami's dropping blocks. This is a wide-open challenge\nright now. Any tribe could win. Aah! Aah! -TIM: Guy, what's up? What's up?\n-No, come on, come on. PROBST: Siga one letter away, but getting that letter in\nand getting it to hold is a whole different thing. BEN:\nJeff, come on! SODA:\nTevin, do not give up. Nami and Siga\nmaking a lot of progress. -Right here, right here.\nRight there.\n-CHARLIE: Nice job, Maria. TIM:\nPush. We got to push them. -(grunts) I see it. I see it.\n-Randen, it's me. Let go, let go, let go... PROBST:\nNami thinks they have it. -They're trying to get it built.\n-Slowly let go. -Slowly let go.\n-Jeff! Jeff! -Jeff!\n-Nami thinks they have it,\nand they don't. -No!\n-Ah! -PROBST: Something is not right.\n-Oh, it's right here... -No.\n-Right here, right here.\nWe got to switch these two. We have to switch these two? -Come on. Come on.\n-There's got to be an N. Got to push. (grunts) -... No!\n-Ben... Stay there.\nStay there. Stay there. Stay there. PROBST:\nSiga starting back now. Stay there.\nYou got it. You got it. -All right, guys, almost there.\n-Aah! -Oh!\n-PROBST: Yanu, another disaster. Blocks everywhere. -CHARLIE: All right, Ben.\n-(groaning) -PROBST: Siga loses\nhalf their puzzle.\n-CHARLIE: It's okay. (overlapping shouting) Nami loses everything.

You've got to spell\na word correctly on both sides and get it to hold on its own. The-the... Wait. Okay, that letter\nover there and this. Someone needs\nto grab that letter. Can we hold on for a sec?\nI got to readjust it real quick. Wait. Just hold it,\nhold it, hold it. Oh, my God! PROBST:\nYanu loses everything again. These blocks are heavy. KENZIE: Still not in. JESS: I'm holding it. (grunting) MORIAH: You guys are one block\naway from victory! -Yes. Oh! No!\n-Okay... And once again,\nSiga loses half their puzzle. Tiff, you need to move over. -You need to move over.\nThat's wrong.\n-This is wrong. -Okay.\n-Just take that one piece. -I'm gonna grab this, okay?\n-Okay. And we're gonna stick this... -Yeah.\n-Okay. (Jess screams) Give me that. Come on.\nGirl, you got to move faster. This is a difficult challenge that requires communication. RANDEN: Come. VENUS: Soda, that is the I. Put it there. Bhanu, I got these two.\nGet the other one. PROBST: Yanu -What do we need here?\n-giving it another go. Hey! PROBST:\nAnd another piece comes down. -(Tiffany yells)\n-Let's go! Now, that fire in Bhanu's belly\nis showing itself. LIZ: Yes. Yes. Hunter, can you get this or no? -HUNTER: Is it last piece?\n-Last piece. You got this. -Ready?\n-Go! I got it. Hang on. PROBST:\nNami back with another shot. -VENUS: Someone support...\n-PROBST: Is this it? -And can they get it together?\n-LIZ (chanting): Yes, you can. Yes, you can! -Yes, you can!\n-SODA: Yes, we... No, no, no, go. You go. And here comes Siga now.\nThey're in it. (overlapping chatter) Yanu thinks they're in it. JESS:\nNo, this is right.\nThis is right. -(chanting): Yes! Yes!\n-PROBST: Everybody is in it now. Nami trying to get it locked in. -It's so close.\n-We got it. Come on. Let's go. PROBST:\nIs it enough? -RANDEN: Jeff. Jeff.\n-HUNTER: Jeff! -Nami has it!\nNami wins immunity.\n-LIZ: Yeah! -PROBST: We're looking\nfor one more.\n-Yeah! (yelling) -LIZ: Wow.\n-PROBST: Nami\nremains undefeated. It's gonna be Siga or Yanu. Keep digging! Aah! I got it! Come on. Aah! PROBST:\nSiga very close. Yanu very close. -It would be their first\n-You got it. -win of the season.\n-Is that it? PROBST:\nThey could send Siga\nto Tribal Council. BHANU:\nI need a hand here.\nI need a hand here! Quickly! Quickly! Bhanu continues\nto bark out orders. Coach... Here. Like this. -Okay. Yeah.\n-You hold this with your hands. -Put your damn hands down.\nLet's go. Hold this one.\n-Yeah. -No, you got that one.\nNow, right here.\n-PROBST: Q is now in charge. Who's going to Tribal Council? Will it be Yanu or Siga? We are so close.\nThis is looking sturdy. Come on. We need someone\nto get that last piece. -Hold that...\n-KENZIE: Oh, my God. -PROBST: Yanu very close,\nbut Bhanu can't hold the pieces.\n-I can't reach. PROBST:\nSiga very close. TIM:\nY'all got it. -(grunting)\n-... What's gonna have to happen is\nyou got to use both of your hands.\nThis way and that way, okay? -Put it back up on 'em.\n-Hold strong. -Hold strong.\n-One... (grunts) (indistinct chatter) Don't let it fall. You hold this one. -(gasps)\n-Aah! Yanu loses everything. The story of the season for\nYanu, as all the pieces drop. Siga thinks they have it. Let's go! (cheering) Siga wins immunity. -Safe from Tribal Council.\n-Yes! PROBST:\nSending Yanu back to Tribal, where the second person will be voted out of Survivor 46. Huge effort by everybody. Yanu, same story-- coming up short. -TIM: Everybody.\nIt took everybody.\n-JEM: I'm so proud. -I'm so...\n-TIM: It took everybody. -Everybody.\n-JEM: Oh, my God. TIM:\nIt took everybody. JEM:\nGuys... PROBST:\nNami, congratulations. -(cheering)\n-It's coming back. Where's that headband? -Where's that headband, baby?\n-(chuckles) PROBST:\nThat headband is toast. LIZ: Damn! PROBST:\nSiga... Congratulations. Nami, nobody going home\nfrom your tribe. Head out. Enjoy the night off. -Thank you.\n-Thank you, Jeff. PROBST:\nYour massive Survivor fishing kit will be waiting for you\nback at camp. SODA:\nOh, man. Wow. PROBST:\nSiga, nobody going home\nfrom your tribe. Head out. Enjoy the night off. And your fishing kit will be\nwaiting for you back at camp. BEN:\nOh, my God. PROBST:\nBhanu, I saw some real emotion,\nmaybe frustration from you during that challenge. What were you feeling? (sighs) (stammers) We're doing everything right, but where we're losing,\nI just don't understand that. We have the strength. What we're missing is the... the planning.\nI think that's what it is. The planning is missing, and we have\nto put our minds together and I think we're\ngonna have a chat today and that's what\nwe're gonna do tonight. PROBST:\nTiffany, this is what happens. When you lose once, \"Hey,\nthat's all right. We got it.\" You lose twice. But when you just\ncontinue to lose... -Look at your body language.\nYou're frustrated.\n-I'm pissed. I'm pissed. No,\nI'm not frustrated. I'm pissed. I have a real attitude\nright now, so I'm gonna keep my actual thoughts to myself\nbefore I say something that's gonna have\npeople looking at me sideways. But I do not think we should\nhave lost that challenge. At all. PROBST:\nSo, Jess, just\nlistening to Tiffany, though she didn't\nsay anything directly, it's gonna be an interesting\nafternoon back at camp. She's gonna give me\na spanking back at camp. Oh, you think\nit's directed at you? I think so.\nEveryone's been yelling at me. All day or during the challenge? JESS:\nDuring the challenge. Are you feeling that pressure as you head back to camp now? I think we're going to\nhave to talk about it at camp. I'm just going to\ncatch my breath right now. I am feeling pressure.\nI think we all are. PROBST:\nAll right, Yanu,\nonce again, Tribal Council, where somebody\nwill be the second person voted out of Survivor 46. As a penalty for losing--\nsorry for you-- I'm gonna keep this flint. Grab your stuff. Head out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council. KENZIE: We started strong,\n and then the puzzle-- it literally fell apart, like, on top of all of us, -because Bhanu has a hard time -(distorted): Jess! when he's faced under pressure. But Jess dropped a bunch\n of pieces a hundred times and couldn't\n spell the word \"persistence.\" So I feel like Jess is our\n common denominator in losing. I want Jess to go tonight. There is simply\nnothing like Survivor. It will test you\non so many levels and offers you nowhere to hide. If that sounds like fun,\napply to be on Survivor.

TEVIN:\nThis is like Christmas. -Wow!\n-TEVIN: Oh, my God. LIZ:\nOkay, go! -Oh! We got the fish!\n-LIZ: Ah! We did it! TEVIN:\nI feel like Rupert. Oh, this is like\na dream come true. (chuckles) What y'all want to do? Fishing? -But we can all go out together.\n-SODA: Okay. I'm probably gonna rest,\n'cause that huge-ass wagon went over my toe\nduring the challenge. -Oh...\n-SODA: Did it really?\n-VENUS: Yeah. -Got pretty crushed,\nso I'm gonna rest.\n-SODA: Wow. -LIZ: I think she got crushed.\n-Yeah. We won this challenge, but I got really pissed afterwards. I actually got my toe crushed by that huge... huge-ass wagon because no one\nwas listening to me. I said, \"Turn left, turn left,\"\n and they just kept going straight and ran me over. What's the point of winning\nif I'm not even being heard? -SODA: Was it the moment where\nyou were wedged at the front\n-Yeah. -and I tried to push you back?\n-VENUS: It was the moment when I was saying, \"Left, left,\"\nbut you kept going straight, and it went right over my toe. TEVIN:\n This journey\n I'm having with Venus is really ridiculous, honestly. It's up and down. It's up and down, and I'm trying\nto navigate it, and it... It's tough. It is very tough. You guys can have a celebration, but I'm exhausted right now,\nso I'll talk later. TEVIN:\n She's, like, commenting\n on the challenge, and we won. She brings the tribe morale\n down, and, uh, I'm getting real tired\nand real sick of this. I had a little bit of an issue with how we worked together\nas a team today, and I personally felt like my\nvoice wasn't being heard at all. Specifically, when\nwe start the challenge, and we're, like,\nmoving the wagon, -you guys are pushing.\n-Mm-hmm. Immediately, I say, you know,\n\"Turn left, turn left,\" and because there was a lack\nof listening, a lack of trust, it ran right over my toe,\nwhich could have been avoided. I'm gonna continuously\nbe in the immunity challenges, so if you guys\nwant to keep winning, you have to find a way\nto, like, work with me. -\"We,\" right?\n-VENUS: All of us. -Sometimes, when you say \"you,\"\nI don't know...\n-Did I say \"you\"? Sorry. Yeah, sometimes\nwhen you say \"you,\" I just don't know if it means me\nor if it means everyone. -No, no, no. I'm talking\nin general, I'm talking general.\n-Okay, okay. Venus, like,\n I adore you as a human being, and I want\nto have this camaraderie, and we have to have\nthis camaraderie for challenges. With that being said, she plays the victim a bit. I'm like,\n \"I'm not gonna baby you. That's a 'you' thing. I can't do\nthat work for you. I'm not you.\" -She's a person that takes\na long time to process.\n-Right. So it's, like, imperative\nthat we don't take anything -she's doing personally.\n-Right. Because she... this is... I've learned\nthis is just how she is. She-she could change on a dime\nbased on her emotions. -It's very clear.\n-Right. VENUS:\n I am a natural introvert,\n but I don't think I would have this issue\nwith any other tribe. It's just that I...\nwe happen to have two really big\n personalities here. I don't really know who she's\nmad at. I guess everyone. VENUS:\n Sodasia-- she has a tendency...\n(chuckles) to kind of want to be\nthe star of the show. Nami, congratulations. VENUS:\n And her tendency to grab\n the immunity idol from me, every time\n Jeff hands it to me... Congratulations.\nIt's coming back. VENUS:\n It's kind of, like,\n really rude and annoying. The fact that\n your first reaction is to just grab it for yourself--\n like, it's a bit childish. You don't want to see\na pissed off version of me. I've been sad the past\nthree days. Now I'm just pissed. So I'm gonna work twice as hard\n to work with Randen to use his Beware Advantage\n to get to a merge, and I will flip immediately against these people. \u266a \u266a BHANU:\nHey. Tiff. No. Come on, dude. You kicked some butt there. You kicked butt there! (sniffles) TIFFANY:\nI'm-a take a little walk.\nI'll be back. Cool. (sniffles, sighs) (groans) (sniffling) I'm not crying because we lost. I mean, I was hurt that we lost,\n but I was just even more upset because of the way\n I lost control. That's just\n not the type of player that I want to be perceived as. Like, nobody on the other tribes\neven knows me yet. I don't want\ntheir perception of me to be this crazy,\nangry Black girl that can't keep her cool\nduring challenges. (sniffles) And I feel like\nthat's what I looked like today. But I was so broken. Because it's like, you're\n not taking this seriously. And I can't work\nwith people like that. I cannot work\nwith people like that. KENZIE:\n You want to take a second -or you want to talk?\n-We can talk. -Are you sure?\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good. -Hey. It was not you.\n-God, I'm so... -I'm so angry.\n-I know. -It's just...\n-It wasn't on you. Hey, bro. -I know.\n-There were so many times\nthat I looked up during the challenge\nand Jess was literally walking. -I know.\n-I'm like, \"Bro.\" KENZIE:\n Tiff was down, down and out. Like, I feel for her. It's not\n a good feeling, but I'm like, \"We lost it. Let's move on\nand talk about Tribal.\" -I felt the same thing.\n-Like, she kept dropping 'em. Look, we can't think about that. We only have\na few hours until Tribal, so you and I\nneed to get straight. Like, what do you want to do? Do you want to hide an idol,\nmake her think she's safe so she doesn't play\nher Shot in the Dark? -I feel like we don't\nhave a choice at this point.\n-Okay. I woke up this morning\n with an idea that we could hide a fake idol and make Jess think she has a real idol\n so that she doesn't play her Shot in the Dark. I macheted off the beads\n from Jelinsky's water bottle. I tell Tiff this idea. We used the note\n from Tiffany's idol and the parchment from\n Tiffany's Beware Advantage. All right,\nthis look official to me. KENZIE:\n Then Tiff went to hide it. The traps have been laid out. They are...\nThe carrot is in the snare. TIFFANY:\nShe'll think she has an idol, -so she won't\nplay her Shot in the Dark.\n-Q: Right. KENZIE:\n The only ones in on this plan\n are me, Q and Tiff. -Y'all do what y'all have to do.\n-TIFFANY: All right. I think it's a foolproof plan. Like, she's gonna find it. It's sticking out a little bit.\nIt's perfect. Honestly, I'm about\nto start go looking for idols. Oh, my God. Do you think you're in trouble? It's Survivor. None of us\ncould be too comfortable. -JESS: Yeah.\n-I'm scared, too, like... Guess we should\ngo look for the idol. TIFFANY:\nWe should. We absolutely should.\nCome on. You don't want\n to look for idols? Girl? Your name\nis on the chopping block. At the very least, you should\n be like, \"Absolutely.\" Not \"Yeah, I think so.\" JESS:\nOh, my God. Spider. -You search those rocks\nover there?\n-No. I led her over to the wall, and sister's over here\n looking at trees. I'm like,\n\"Did you check the wall? Did you check the rock wall?\" You said you don't\nthink it's in this area? But we literally\nlooked everywhere else. You searched\nreal good over there? It's right there, girl. Sis can't look for idols\n to save her life. I literally planted the idol\n in the same exact spot where I found it, and she walks right on past. I'm not gonna get this girl\nto get this idol. Did you talk to her? Jess is not gonna find it, even if we had\n a blinking neon sign that was like,\n\"There's an idol right here.\" Jess would have just, like,\nwalked right underneath it. Should we let Q... (whispering):\nJess, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess. -Yeah?\n-(whispers): Come here. Hurry, hurry. -Okay.\n-Listen... Yes. It's my idol. -Can we go over here?\n-Come on, come on, come on. I show Jess this fake idol,\n and I tell her, \"You have to write down\nwho I want.\" Okay. When I give you this,\njust keep looking. -Keep looking\nuntil we have to leave.\n-I will keep looking. Q:\n Because of my relationship\n with Jess, and telling Jess that\nI want us to work together, but I want no one\nto know about it, has allowed me to present\n this fake idol to Jess and her think it's real. -Play it cool at Tribal.\n-Okay. I told you, I got your back.\nTrying to help. Do not say that I gave you this,\nwe talked. You go that way.\nI'm going this way. We should get rid of Jess\n for many reasons, but I am Jess's number one. All I need to do is tell Jess to write down Kenzie. How do you... Come on, show me. Q:\n I am Bhanu's number one. I have Bhanu's vote. The three\n of us have enough votes. We can get Kenzie out this game. Okay. Q:\n I have Jess on one side,\n who I want going home. I have Kenzie on the other side,\n who I want going home. So I know one of the two\nthat I want to go home... ...will exit tonight. -(whoops)\n-(chuckles) He re ' s to g et ti ng be tt er w it h ag e. Here's to beating\nthese two every Thursday.

KENZIE: When we get that flint,\n we're gonna be set. TIFFANY:\nBe careful. Ow. -You cut yourself?\n-Yeah. -Is it bad?\n-Yeah, it is pretty bad. -TIFFANY: Oh, my God.\n-Really, really bad. TIFFANY:\nSee? I told you to be careful. KENZIE:\n We're about to go to Tribal and our best person\n with the machete chops his finger open. We can't catch a break. Just the cherry on top. (laughs) Oh, this sucks. KENZIE:\n Jess was never gonna find the fake idol, so Q just gave it to her. -(laughs)\n-Girl, what are we working to? This is clown school. (snorts) You have to be smart\nto go to clown school. This is remedial clown school. KENZIE:\n It's pretty glaringly obvious that Q, Tiff and I\n are the only people here who know anything\nabout the game. And we are working with... Oh, my God. There's, like,\nsomething pointy in my neck. ...some dinguses. Why can't something go right? Hopefully,\njust go right tonight. I'm voting for Jess tonight. Not because she's a bad person,\n it's just, she's a bad Survivor player.\nIt is what it is. JESS:\n My game tonight relies on Q, but I'm starting to wonder,\n like, I don't even know if the idol he gave me is real. It's got this thing that looks like\nevery adornment on every Survivor gear\nthat we have. Can you look me in the eyes and\ntell me that the idol is real? I found the idol on day... I tell you what.\nJust give it back. -(chuckles)\n-No, no, no, no. 'Cause I'm risking my idol -for you to stay.\n-Okay. For you to question it... JESS:\n I don't really have a choice\n but to play it and hope that it's real. I think Kenzie's a huge threat.\n She's just gonna sail to the final three\nif they don't... if they don't get rid of her. But I think Tiffany and Q\n are working together, so I don't think\n Q would pull off a blindside tonight without Tiff. Do you think\nTiffany would vote Kenzie? That's a good question. JESS:\n So I'm going\nto put Kenzie's name out there, which is probably very stupid, but I need to be\nplaying this game as well. TIFFANY:\nLike, where's your head at? I feel like nobody wants to,\nlike, throw out a name. There's five of us\nwho need three people -to vote one person out.\n-Yeah. What's the pros and cons\nof everybody? Who do you want to start with? -Um, I'll start with Bhanu.\n-Yeah. While-while he's\na sweet, sweet soul, I think he's\na bit emotional at times. -Yeah. -TIFFANY: Jess, pros... I'll circle back to that. Yeah, I don't know\nwhat Jess' pros are, so I think we're pretty solid on\nthe fact that we want Jess out. What are\nyour pros and cons for Kenz? Oh, my God.\nKenz is so socially strong -that if she went to the merge,\n-Yeah. she's, like, so fast\ngetting to everybody and bonding with them. -Is that a pro or a con, though?\n-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n-I don't know. I haven't\nmade that up in my mind yet. At this point,\n I think Jess is kind of, like, floating around\n and putting out feelers to see who... who will not\nwrite her name down. We were talking about\npros and cons of everybody. We were on, like, Q. JESS:\nQ, pros: tribe strength. -Yeah, so-so\nwhat are y'all thinking?\n-JESS: Yeah. TIFFANY:\nIt's Bhanu? I mean, what else is there?\nI don't want it to be any of us. -KENZIE: But right now...\n-JESS: Yeah. we have a chance to not lose. -BOTH: Yeah.\n-KENZIE: And that\nis because of Q. But, right now,\nit's pretty essential -that we keep him.\n-TIFFANY: I agree. Last Tribal,\n I wanted Jess out first, and the whole way home, I just kept thinking to myself, \"You should've\n got Jess out first.\" -Y'all ready? Okay.\n-Yeah. TIFFANY:\n But I'm okay with that, because she going home tonight anyway, so... JESS:\nWell, Kenz joined us. -What'd she say?\n-Well... (chuckles softly) -BHANU: Jess,\nyou got to be open with Q.\n-She pitched one of you, -and it was... you.\n-Q: Okay. BHANU:\nBro, this is not nice. I don't like this. I don't like\nto have my name out there. I just don't understand.\n Why me? I'm giving my blood,\nsweat and tears to this tribe, and when... and the result,\noutcome is this? Just because\nI'm a little emotional doesn't mean that\nyou guys vote me out. (whispers):\nLike, we need to vote her out. She's playing you like a fiddle. BHANU:\n I'm very nervous, because\n Jess and I just started talking strategy,\n and I don't know if she's gonna\n stick to the plan to blindside Kenzie. What do you say that I can trust you with this, that you're gonna\nnot gonna go back and talk to Kenzie about our plan? How can I trust that? Jess... Q: So what'd they say about me? They want to keep you 'cause\nyou're strong. (chuckles softly) Q:\nOh, because I'm strong, huh? But then, at some point,\nit won't matter -how strong any of us are.\n-Q: Right. See, Tiff has to be on board. -You're right.\n-JESS: Yeah. Bhanu, you're not\ngoing anywhere. Trust me. I have Jess and Bhanu's vote, but the problem is this. Bhanu and Jess\n are both liabilities, so I need Tiff. I need her. I need her\nto be on the same page as me. -For real?\n-Yeah, that's what she said. Damn. That's crazy. -Yeah.\n-Yo, Kenzie is definitely\nintimidated by you. Kenzie wants me to herself. What'd Kenzie say? Well, no, she didn't\nsay anything specific to me. She just, like,\nshe'll make comments like, \"You're my number one, right?\" I'm like,\n\"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,\" like... But, no, I-I do...\nI can pick up on the fact that she's intimidated\nby our relationship. Man, I don't trust\nthat girl now, bro. Let me get, uh, closer to you. Q:\n Kenzie don't like\n that I am Tiff's number one. Eventually, she's gonna\n get jealous. Why not just get rid of this problem\nbefore it's an actual problem? Kenzie don't\nreally want me here. -I'm telling you.\n-TIFFANY: You don't\nthink she do? Hell no.\nShe want me here now -because of the strength.\n-Huh. We go to the merge,\nshe will get rid of me -in a heartbeat. -TIFFANY: Kenzie's super loyal to me. I don't know\n if she's as loyal to Q. And that's where\n the divide comes. Q wants her out ASAP, but is it too soon? Q:\nSomebody don't want me here\nand I can feel it, I can't play with them. ... Q:\n I don't trust Kenzie and she doesn't trust me. But here's the deal.\n I'm in the middle. I have two plans going\n and I don't know which plan we're gonna execute. Keeping Jess means\n I have a loyal number. She's someone\n who can vote with me, but I have to babysit a lot more. If we keep Kenzie,\n I don't have to do much work. She's a self-starter. Kenzie's gonna\n go on the other side and bring in numbers, but those numbers\n might not benefit me. I have to figure out\nwhich one will be the best for my endgame, and\nI have to figure it out quick. \u266a \u266a ( \u266a \u266a ) Start your day\n with Nature Made.

Jeff, we have to rely on\neach other in these conditions. We don't have anybody else. We have to use\neach other's resourcefulness. Bhanu even cut his finger with a\nmachete today, just to feed us. -Like, we're learning to...\n-You mean he fed you\npart of his flesh? (laughing) I wish.\nI really need the protein. PROBST:\nSo, Kenzie, you're\nalways relying on each other, even though you're\nvoting each other out, and that's part of what\nmakes it so complicated. KENZIE:\nYeah, it is complicated\nbecause we all genuinely enjoy each other, but, like,\nnow we're having to choose who can we work with\nlong-term in gameplay. It's hard, but that's\nthe reality of the game. Tiffany, Kenzie was very\nspecific in saying, \"Right now, we have to decide who we can\nplay this game with long-term.\" I agree with her. I'm a person\nwho-who acts off of data. And if we look at the data, we have lost\nevery challenge we competed in. So we would be fools\nnot to think about who can we play this game\nwith beyond the tribe stage of the game. Wow. I'm trying to think\nif there's been a tribe that has admitted this\npublicly in front of each other, especially\nthis early in the game. So, Jess, does\nit frighten you that it could come down tonight,\npotentially, to relationships -that people are\nthinking about days from now?\n-JESS: Yeah. It's a dog-eat-dog world\nout here, and I don't know\nthat we have our stuff together to win\nthe next immunity challenge. We have to be realistic, and we have to think about\nhow to move forward. And it sucks because Kenzie\nand I have not talked strategy. We've been kind of\ntiptoeing around each other. I described it as, like, we're dancing\nwithout touching each other. -It's really weird.\n-(Kenzie chuckles) It's weird 'cause we're both, like, the smallest people\non the tribe, -and, like, everybody thinks\nthat you're their BFF,\n-Yeah. and you're just amazing. Like, you're-you're going\nto eat everybody moving forward. -Like...\n-KENZIE: Yeah. I love that you pointed that out\nto everyone. -I should've said this\nto your face.\n-KENZIE: It's fine. It's okay, but it doesn't, like,\nmake me want to be like, \"So, what do you want to do? \"Throw me under the bus?\nBeautiful. Love it. Let's dance.\" So, no, I didn't want to talk\nstrategy with you today. PROBST:\nWow, so, Q, I'm guessing\nyou didn't anticipate Tribal Council\nwas gonna go exactly like this. You know, Jess, in her mind, she thinks she's in trouble. So now she's saying, \"Okay, \"if I'm going out,\nI want everybody to be aware of what is a hidden threat\nwithin this camp.\" And if that's her truth,\nthat's her truth. Let's talk\nabout today's challenge. Tiffany, you were so frustrated you said,\n\"I'm not even gonna talk,\" which is a normal situation. When you lose like this,\nif you're not frustrated or a little angry,\nthen you're not in it. Yeah. I was-I was devastated\nafter that loss. I willed myself\nthrough that challenge. I gave everything I had. So to still do that and lose, like, it-it broke me, like... So I knew at the end,\nwhen we were just standing there,\nI was upset from the loss and I knew that we were\ncoming back here tonight. I knew it was better for me\nto just shut up in that moment than to say something stupid\nthat I would want to take back. Bhanu, you had no problem\nreleasing your emotions today. Jeff, I'm a very\npassionate person. What's in here is here. I get that a lot. \"Oh, Bhanu is emotional.\nHe's crying. He's weak.\" Do you know\nhow much courage it takes for someone to just\nshow their emotions? I'm showing all my courage.\nI'm showing my true self. I'm authentic. And tonight,\nI'm holding my tears and I don't want\nto get emotional because, Jeff, I heard someone\nin the tribe saying that, \"Oh, Bhanu, he's-he's weak.\nHe's too emotional.\" If this passion, if this emotion\nis making you feel like, \"Oh, my God, you're too... You're-you're too this,\nyou're too that,\" I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But this is me,\nthe passionate me. So are you saying you think\nyou're in trouble tonight? -Because...\n-Absolutely. I'm 100% on the chopping block\ntonight, but tell me where\nI'm failing in this tribe. They know that I'm reliable.\nThey know that I'm trustworthy. They know that I'm honest.\nThey know that I'm disciplined. They know that I'm hardworking. When you close, it's what? -It's a strength. It's a power.\n-I feel it. I've told them. I had these\nconversations with Tiffany, with Q, of course,\nKenzie as well. And I told them,\nindividually and together, \"Work with me.\nI want to work with you.\" Bhanu, I got to say something,\nbecause you've done this twice, so I don't feel\nlike I'm stepping -into your game too much.\n-Please. Please. You appear\nto be very forthcoming about who you're tight with. At the first Tribal Council, you were blurting out\nlots of things and saying, \"Let's just vote\n'cause it's Jelinsky.\" And just now,\nwhat I've gathered is you have an alliance\nwith Kenzie, Q and Tiffany. So how about Jess? Jess and I...\nOh, how can I explain this? I only connected\nwith Jess yesterday. Yeah. So, Q,\nwhat do you make of Tribal now? Q:\nJeff, we have\nto be very, very careful of what we say\nwhen we sit in this seat. The emotions don't\nhave to come out all the time. Being able to control them\nis just as powerful as letting 'em out. Jeff, the only reason\nwhy I said this is because this is our tribe. If we're in a merge,\nI'm not gonna say, like, \"Oh, they said this...\"\nThis is just our tribe. This is Yanu. Once I say it, I'm done with it. -Right, but it's gonna come\na time where you can't say it.\n-But what Q's saying... It's gonna have to stay here.\nIt can't come out of the mouth. I can do that, too.\nI'm training myself. If Jess now feels like we're all in an alliance\nand she's going home, what if she pulls out an idol\nand write my name down? You see how\nthat kind of plays itself? Q, I understand that,\nbut I also trust in my connection with Jess. Understood.\nJeff, it's time to vote. You all ready to vote? \u266a \u266a All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. All right, let's party. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has\nan advantage or an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. PROBST:\nPlaying this for yourself? Yeah, I'm going\nto play it for myself. -For yourself. Okay.\n-Yeah. PROBST:\nYou can sit back down. \u266a \u266a This is... not a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Jess will still count. (both laugh) All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Bhanu. Jess. One vote Bhanu,\none vote Jess. That's two votes Jess,\none vote Bhanu. Second person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Jess. Oh, man. You guys are so good. Oh, my God. (groans) -Jess...\n-(laughs) -You okay?\n-This, just, whole thing\nis so surreal. Yeah, I'm okay. The tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Bye, Jess.\n-Bye, Jess.\n-JESS (laughs): Bye. Geez Louise.

KENZIE:\n I woke up this morning\n with an idea that we could make a fake idol and make Jess think\n she has a real idol. I'm trying to help. I have Jess on one side. I have Kenzie on the other side. So I know one of the two that I want to go home will exit tonight. Bhanu, you appear\nto be very forthcoming about who you're tight with.\nSo, how about Jess? Playing this for yourself? Yeah.\nGoing to play it for myself. -For yourself? Okay.\n-Yeah. This is... not a hidden immunity idol. (both laughing) Second person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Jess. Oh, man. The tribe has spoken. -Q: That was a fun Tribal.\n -TIFFANY: Yeah. -KENZIE: It was lively.\n-TIFFANY: It sure was. BHANU:\nI felt so naive. -I really did.\n-TIFFANY: Why? BHANU:\nWhere did she get the idol from? We just snipped it off\nof D.J.'s water bottle. When we got back to camp, I feel like we had a little bit\nof explaining to do. Bhanu didn't know anything\n about the fake idol, and we had to frame it so that, like,\nit was all in his best interest. We didn't want to tell you\nuntil we got back to camp because we didn't want you\nto accidentally blurt it out. Q:\nYou got to think about it now. Let's say if that idol was real. She wrote your name down, so... She wrote my name down? -Yes.\n-Q: Yeah. BHANU: She said that everyone's\nwriting my name down? Q:\nNo, she wrote your name down. KENZIE:\nWe all voted Jess. -We all voted for Jess.\n-Q: We all voted Jess. And she voted for you. That's why\nwe gave her that fake idol. KENZIE:\nSo that she wouldn't play\nher Shot in the Dark. Q:\nSo she wouldn't play\nthat Shot in the Dark. BHANU:\n I'm so glad that\n I'm still on the island. So... namaste to that. (laughs) But I could be the next person\n going home because Kenzie, Q and Tiffany\n are pulling all their master tricks. They played it in such a way that Jess plays\n the fake hidden humidity idol rather than\n the Shot in the Dark. And she writes a name,\nand guess whose name she wrote. Jess said that I'm her best\nfriend, and she wrote my name. (laughs) Survivor it is. Q:\nThat's why\nit's so critical at Tribal. We got to watch what we say\nand when we say things. Mm-hmm. Q:\nTribal is not over until Jeff... KENZIE:\nReads the votes\nand snuffs somebody's torch. Q:\nReads the vote\nand snuff the torch. So just because\nwe're at Tribal don't mean now is the time\nto air it out, you know? TIFFANY:\nYou can totally lie to Jeff. -It's okay.\n-(Bhanu sighs)\n-KENZIE: Or just, like, -not saying anything at all.\n-TIFFANY: Or just... I was about to say,\n\"Or just keep quiet.\" -KENZIE: If you don't\nwant to lie,\n-You can't lie, -just don't say nothing.\n-don't say anything. BHANU:\n They're saying like,\n \"Oh, you don't have to, \"like, give honest answers\n to Jeff Probst. You can just give him\n any kind of crap.\" But I can't do that. They said that you should know when to-- what is it-- when to show, when to shot? Something like that.\nI don't know what that proverb. Something... you know... Fold? Ah. You have to know when to... when to fold, when to hold. I'm not an actor. I can't do that. (sniffles)\nYeah. So that's where I'm at. (laughs) \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a (birdsong) KENZIE:\n We are probably going down\n in Survivor history as, like, one of the\nroughest starts in the new era. We haven't won anything. We still don't have a fire. We're getting rained on,\nthe shelter has holes in it. We found\n this rock wall overhang. Here's a ton of dirt,\nand we slept here. Like, that's where Yanu is at. I'm gonna walk back to camp\nand get my water... -Are you okay?\n-Yeah. -What's going on?\n-Okay. -I didn't sleep, that's all.\n-Yeah? Yeah. It was raining all night. I didn't sleep a wink. And I'm paranoid\nbecause those three-- all three of them\n are in a tight alliance, and if we don't win the next immunity challenge,\n I'll be going home. They have so many tricks\n in their hats to pull. They're very good at this. All three are masterminds. One mind versus three. The only way to save myself is to find a hidden immunity\n idol so I can move forward. It's not here. Where can I find this idol? It can be under many\nof these coconuts. I've been looking for the idol\n pretty much the whole time I've been on this island. So many coconuts. And I don't have any luck. I have to turn\nall these coconuts upside down. I don't know. This is so frustrating. I want to play the game, and... I'm hitting a wall all the time. (groans) BHANU:\nCan I have\na heart-to-heart with you? KENZIE:\nWhat's wrong? I want to stay in this game, but it seems like, you know, my name is\non the chopping block next. And that's why I'm asking, like, if there is any way\nthat I can work with you. I mean, I'm open\nto hearing plans, for sure. I-I don't have any, and I'm not\nthrowing any names out there. I'm just asking, like... Do you see how\nthat's kind of hard for me to work with, though? Bhanu is not playing, is what Banu is doing wrong. He doesn't have a strategic bone\nin his sweet little body. I feel so alone. I don't know what to do.\n(sniffles) I need some help, Kenzie. KENZIE:\n He loves the game,\n he loves to watch it, but it's different to play it. I think he just came out here\nwith a good attitude, which is appreciated,\ndefinitely, but it's not a long-term thing\nthat's gonna get you far, especially now, in the new era. Like, we only have 26 days. People are dropping like flies\nand right now, it's us. Loyalty is very important\nin regular life and Survivor, but you also have to\ncome up with some plan for people to be able\nto work with. BHANU:\n Always sweet Kenzie--\n how she portrays herself-- she's like this mermaid... dragon. Mermaid up until here, but she's hiding\n under the rocks. She's like a very beautiful,\n sweet, kind mermaid. But when\nyou look behind the rock, it's a big dragon tail. That's Kenzie. I said, like,\n \"Hey, can I work with you?\" And she's like,\n \"Yeah, I can work with you, \"but you have\n to tell me the plan. \"So if you have a plan,\n then let me know and then we can work on it.\" Mermaid... dragon. Remember that. I don't know where\nmy-my position is in the tribe. Here's the deal. I want\nto keep you around because I know for a fact that you're a loyal person\nand a loyal vote. I would rather have somebody\nthat's loyal that I can coach you up\nto say, at Tribal Council, \"This is what you say.\" You've looked at past seasons, look at Boston Rob's season. He had a Phillip.\nYou're my Phillip. I know you're gonna\nbe a loyal soldier. You're gonna be there.\nYou're not gonna flip-flop. You can listen to information, but you're not gonna flip on me. That's what I want to take, bub. I knew Bhanu\n was having a hard time, but what I don't want him\nto do is get so wrapped up in his mind\nthat we're against him and he gives up. So I had to reassure Bhanu\n that we're in this together, and if push comes to shove, we just have to make sure\nthat we're on the same page. It is going to be\nan uphill battle to get our foot\nback into this game. But if you can\nconnect with folks like how you were\nat camp with us, you have a great shot\nat winning. -You see what I'm saying?\n-But I cannot win. -Anybody can win.\n-I'm a wackadoodle -and, like...\n-Wackadoodles win. Get the confidence within. You can win,\njust like I can win. So, cheer up. We're good. -Thank you, Coach.\n-Yes, sir. BHANU:\nThat's a really,\nreally good talk. However, what if the girls\ncame up with that idea? Because even last night, the girls came up with\n the fake immunity idol thing. So what they're trying\nto do is... I don't have to play my Shot in the Dark so they can...\nthey can vote me off. That's what they wanted to do. Or maybe Q is really... He like... he likes me. I don't know. How will I know?

Connect with an advisor to create\n your personalized plan. Let's find the right\ninvestments for your goals Okay, great. J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. \u266a \u266a JEM (sing-songy):\n We're going on a field trip. Going to find some idols. CHARLIE:\nOh, idol, where are you? Where do you live? MORIAH:\n This morning, we all agree to go on an idol hunt together. Aah! The thing\n with a group idol hunt is you're half hunting for idols and you're half hunting\nfor pocket clumps. You got one eye on the ground and you got one eye on\nthe person next to you looking. -Did you find it?\n-No.\n-No. Off the beaten path, eh? I got stuck\nin a tree once as a kid. BEN:\nNo bueno, dude. (laughs) I was like,\n\"It's not. It's a leaf.\" Big old nothing.\nBig old goose egg out here. Charlie, did we\ngo that way already? I really think, like,\nthis tree looks promising. CHARLIE:\n The group idol hunts--\n they feel a little fake. I guarantee you, if anyone out here\ncould find an idol or advantage on their own and in secret, they're gonna keep it\nto themselves. JEM:\nKeep looking. We'll find it. CHARLIE:\n I want that to be Charlie's idol.\nI want that to be mine. JEM:\nThis is such a unique tree. I feel like\nit has to be one in here. CHARLIE:\n If I find something,\n I don't want anyone to hear me screech\n or see the sparkle in my eye when I know\nthat I have that extra little safety\n in that little, little pouch. JEM:\n I spot the Beware Advantage. I grabbed it and I immediately\n stuck it in my pants. And Charlie's right next to me, so I had to tell myself like,\n\"Calm down.\" My heart was like this 'cause\nI was so scared in that moment. Come on, little idol. JEM:\n I think I pulled it off 'cause everybody was still\n idol hunting like crazy. In the back of my mind, I was like, \"What did I just, like, literally\nshove down my pants?\" I was like, \"I want to read it.\n I want to read it so bad.\" Oh, my God. I hope that\nit's a simple process. I want to go, like,\n dig it up and find out, but I don't want\n anybody to know. I'll go tonight. I don't care\nif it's dark and I can't see. At least I know\nwhere I have to go. Finally, it gets pitch dark. We're laying around, and I look\n to see if everybody is asleep. (snoring) I heard Tim start snoring. So, this is the perfect\n golden opportunity to slip away silently. (snoring) My heart's beating, like,\n really superfast because I don't want\n to get caught 'cause that's gonna paint,\n like, a target on my back. But to play this game, you have to be tough\n and you have to take every advantage that you have in order to, like,\n propel you further. So I start digging.\n I can't see anything. Like, literally,\n it's so pitch black. And then, I move some more.\n Like, I dig really deep. And then, I feel a box. My heart just dropped.\n It's a freaking lockbox. And then,\nI saw a scroll attached to it. Then it says... \"The location of the key\nwill remain a mystery until after your tribe loses\na future immunity challenge.\" \"Until you have taken possession\nof the idol, you cannot vote\nat Tribal Council.\" Oh, my God. What the hell did you\nget yourself into, Jem? I just want that idol so bad, like, now more than ever 'cause\nI need it to restore my vote. (chopping) What is this man doing now? LIZ:\nYou're gonna make\na bed right here? Oh, I believe you. Hunter is Survivor MacGyver. Anything that comes to his brain or that the tribe needs,\nhe can do. SODA:\nWhere does\nhe get this stuff from? Must just run in the family, like, the outdoor lifestyle.\nYou know? He actually doesn't need to talk\n that much strategy right now because he has strength\nand we want to keep winning. So, no one wants\n to get rid of him. -(creak)\n-SODA: Oh, it made a bed sound. (laughing):\nIt made a bed sound. LIZ:\n I feel like he's here because he just loves the adventure\nof it all. HUNTER:\n I love that people think I'm just here to help the tribe. I'm a very intelligent\nindividual and I don't want people\nto know that. I want to keep that inside. When I was growing up,\n I was always good at school. I graduated college early. I had direct admissions\ninto medical school. I had a full-ride scholarship. But as I was getting set up\n to go to medical school, I got the opportunity\n to substitute teach for my sister in my hometown. I had just seen Survivor. I fell in love with it. And I said, \"I want to build\n a challenge for the kids \"before I go off\n to medical school. It'll be my last big thing\n to plan before I go.\" But being in the classroom and being with the kids day in\n and day out and having kids come to me and say,\n \"I really enjoyed that.\" I was like,\n \"Wow. This just feels right.\" And so I changed from the full-ride scholarship\nto medical school. My parents lost their minds,\nbut I came back and I chose to teach. I also don't think I want\n to advertise that, \"Hey, I build challenges\nin my backyard.\" This is what\nmy house looks like. It's full of puzzles\nand stuff left over from previous challenges\nthat I've done. The drop-down puzzles,\ntiles for building towers, more puzzles,\nreplicas of puzzles, more pieces of puzzles, sandbags thrown,\nmore stacks of puzzles, more puzzles. So, yes, I am a superfan, but it seems like\na silly thing to share. Uh, it-it's like-it's like\npainting a target on my back. Oh, Hunter. Wow. Make me a Tempur-Pedic. VENUS:\n Hunter is just... We see him every season. You know, there's always\nthat one big buff guy. \"I'm the provider.\n You can't vote me out.\" And as a person, I think Hunter's, like,\na really sweet dude. But also, I can see\nright through that facade. Tevin and Hunter\nare running this game and if you don't\nsee that, then... Hunter is running this game? -You don't think so?\n-No. -Do you?\n-I-I can't see your perspective unless you provide\nyour perspective. I'm asking you\nfor your, you know? Uh, my perspective is\nI'm not blind. If you just look around,\nwho has the greatest link with as many people? Hunter has Tevin on lock.\n He has that connection. I want Hunter out\n because I feel like he has too many links\n with too many people, and we need\nto break that chain immediately. Sk in -c ar vi ng n ex t le ve l hy dr at io n?

How are you? The weather was terrible\n last night, so we all decided to sleep\n in the shelter we built. In the middle of the night,\nI felt, like, a sharp sensation,\nlike a... it was like a zap. And I realized that I was limp\n on my right side. Dude, I don't have a sense... Like, I can't grip anything\nwith my right arm. -Oh, my God.\n-So... I mean... All right, so, uh,\nthis morning, I got up and I noticed that I had, like,\na tingly feeling, a prickle, like, a prickly feeling\nin my leg and on my arm from here to my...\nfrom... to my fingers. I was swinging my arms,\ntrying to stretch, figure it's just bad sleeping,\nyou know, but I can't grip with my right hand. So, immediately, I'm scared, you know, because\nI know we have a challenge And I really never wanted\nto sit out a challenge. I'm gonna have medical\ntook a look at it. I've never experienced\n something like this, ever. This is my worst nightmare. I need my arms. -DR. WILL: So,\nit's this bit here?\n-Yeah, that is numb. -That is, like, a numb...\nStraight numb.\n-Just there? There? -And how about this side here?\n-I don't feel that at all. No sensation at all? RANDEN:\n Out here, everybody has\n to do something. You have to pull your weight. So, something like this-- it can be a liability. People look at you like, \"Well,\nwhat are you useful for, then?\" What am I gonna do,\na running challenge? Our kind of working diagnosis\nat the moment is you've got a trapped nerve,\nmaybe lower down in the arm. It could potentially\nbe in the neck. It's really hard\nto-to tell at the moment. I understand that this is not\ngonna help me do a challenge. I think that's sensible. I think\nwe do need to keep a close eye on you and see\nwhat direction things move in. Okay. -See you.\n-Nice to see you, too. RANDEN:\n I'm the kind of guy that wants to face things head on, and I just want to heal\nso I can compete. I hope that today when I rest,\n that it gets better because the tribe game is teamwork. And now\n I'm kind of a liability. \u266a \u266a Come on in. Nami and Siga,\ngetting your first look at the new Yanu tribe. Jess voted out -at the last Tribal Council.\n-(gasping) I told y'all. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -(all voice assent)\n-(whooping)\n-PROBST: First things first. Got to take back the idols. Thank you, Liz. -Bye, Frodo.\n-Thanks, Jem. Once again,\nimmunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge\nyou're gonna leap into the ocean, then climb up and over\n a stack of crates. You must then work together\n to get over a rolling barrel, then up a net ramp. When you reach the beach,\n you'll dig up sandbags and attempt to land them\n on a series of targets. The first two tribes to finish win immunity,\nsafe from the vote. In addition,\nyou're playing for reward. (cheering) Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? -(all voicing assent)\n-PB and J! First tribe to finish-- a massive Survivor toolkit -Oh, a tarp. A tarp!\n-and a large tarp. -Tarp! Tarp.\n-Tarp. Second tribe to finish-- -smaller toolkit\nand a smaller tarp.\n-MORIAH: (whoops) Tarp! -There's nails in there, bro.\n-Worth playing for? -(all voicing assent)\n-Oh, yeah.\n-PROBST: All right. Losers: Tribal Council,\nwhere somebody will be the third person\nvoted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing, I will keep your flint.\nYanu, you are still\ntrying to earn yours. Sit-outs.\nSiga, two people sitting out, cannot be the same person, which means\nMoriah must participate. Maria and Jem gonna\ntake a sit-out for Siga. Nami, two people sitting out.\nIt cannot be Liz. -She must compete.\n-I think it's long... Who are gonna be the sit-outs? -SODA: Do you want to go?\n-I'm comfortable. You go. -I'm sitting out, Jeff.\n-SODA: Okay. PROBST:\nRanden and Soda. All right, sit-outs, take a spot\non the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute\nto strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it!\n-(applause) \u266a \u266a All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! Got to swim out to the platform, go up and over those crates. Everybody in the water. -Come on.\n-PROBST: Yanu still looking for their first win\nof the season. Gonna be Bhanu up first. Here goes Tim for Siga.\nThat's how you do it! Here comes Ben for Siga. -Okay.\n-Come on! -TEVIN: We're good, we're good.\n-PROBST: Q in the water. Here comes Charlie. Nami taking a long time\nat the crate. That ocean is moving\neverything around, making it very difficult. Got to get everybody\nto the barrel. Pick it up! Let's go! We got this, we got this.\nGo, go, go. PROBST:\nLiz finally in the water.\nThere goes Venus. Let's go. PROBST:\nThere goes Tevin. Nami in an unfamiliar spot: dead last. Now you've got to work together to get over that barrel. The most difficult part\nof the challenge right here. That barrel's gonna\nmove the other way, pull you back down. -There we go.\n-PROBST: Tim is over for Siga. It's Siga in the lead. -Q trying to get over for Yanu.\n-MARIA: Come on, Siga! -PROBST: Q is over.\n-SODA: Come on, Nami. -You're in this.\n-PROBST: Nami's at their barrel. -They can start working on it.\n-We're good. This requires\na lot of communication -and everybody working together.\n-I got you. I got you. Push. PROBST:\nThere goes Ben for Siga. -Go, Siga!\n-PROBST: Siga has two people over the barrel now. -There goes Kenzie.\n-Yes. PROBST:\nThere goes Moriah for Siga. -SODA: Nami, let's go!\n-PROBST: Nami still\na big goose egg. Nobody's gotten\nover that barrel. Charlie now the remaining\ntribe member for Siga. This is where\nit gets really tricky. -Fly!\n-PROBST: There goes Bhanu\nfor Yanu. Look at that.\nYanu's in this challenge. TIM:\nI got it. Go, go, go! PROBST:\nThey've got Charlie.\nYou're good, Siga! Siga can head up\nto the net ramp. -SODA: Let's go, Liz!\n-PROBST: Liz is over. Let's go, Nami!\nYou got this! -You guys got to get ready.\n-No, no, we're good. TEVIN:\nThat's right, you're so good.\nY'all are doing great. PROBST:\nThere goes Tiff! You're good, Yanu! Get to that net ramp. Keep moving.\nIt is Siga in the lead. Yanu is not in last. -Push it, Venus!\n-Come on, Venus! Got to roll it. PROBST:\nVenus is over for Nami. -MARIA: Come on, let's do it!\n-PROBST: You're good! -Start digging.\n-JEM: Go, guys. Go! PROBST: Here comes Yanu. There goes Kenzie and Q. You guys got this, Siga!\nYou've got this! MARIA:\nYeah, Nami. All right, ready?\nOne, two, three. Yes! Wow! Tevin pulls Hunter! What a move by Nami. -That's how you do it!\n-PROBST: That was\na one-two punch. That might get Nami back in it. Q and Kenzie are literally\nwalking up the beach. Seven days of fatigue\non Survivor. It is Siga digging.\nNow Yanu can dig. Nami still in the water,\ntrying to get back. You need to pick it up! -Let's go, Nami! You're in it!\n-Come on, Nami, let's go! PROBST:\nCan they make up the time? Siga has their sandbags. You got to get them all out\nbefore you can start throwing. -SODA: You're in it, Nami.\n-PROBST: There goes Hunter. Liz is over, Venus is over, Tevin's over. SODA:\nPush! Let's go, Nami! JEM:\nCome on, Siga! We got this,\nSiga! We got this, Siga! It's gonna be Moriah\ntossing bags. (indistinct chatter) PROBST:\nYanu has their sandbags. -SODA: Let's go, my babies.\n-You're good! Start digging! SODA:\nTake a breath, loves of my life.\nYou're in it. PROBST:\nHere comes Bhanu in for Yanu. Ben now gonna give it a shot\nfor Siga. Y'all are so in this. PROBST:\nStill nobody\nwith any bags landed. That is good news for Nami. -Yes! Yes!\n-Yes! Come on and land it!\nKeep going! PROBST:\nNami has their sandbags. Got to get 'em untied\nand emptied. Nami is back\nin this challenge as Yanu and Siga have yet\nto land a single bag. Bhanu misses.\nCharlie misses. -There goes Hunter.\n-SODA: I believe in you. PROBST:\nWe are dead even right now. -Yes!\n-Yes!\n-PROBST: And Hunter lands with his first toss, the first bag. -It is now Nami back\nin the lead.\n-RANDEN: Good shot. -Hunter, get it!\n-There you go. Hunter has\na second bag for Nami. Hunter with another...\nNice touch. On and off. Hunter has got this figured out.\nThat is three in a row. -JEM: Charlie, you got this!\n-PROBST: Q feeling the pressure. Charlie feeling the pressure. SODA:\nYou got it, baby. PROBST:\nNami was in dead last, and they are now decidedly\nin the lead. And there is number four\nfor Nami. Still nothing\nfor the other two tribes. -Oh, I got it!\n-PROBST: Tiff lands\nthe first one for Yanu. Hunter for the win. -(cheering)\n-There it is!\nNami wins immunity, once again safe from the vote. An amazing performance\nby Hunter. We are looking for one more. It is now Siga and Yanu. Yanu in the lead with one. Q coming back in,\ntrying to land number two. Q, slice it! Charlie has the first one\nfor Siga. We are tied, one-one. Five bags total. Somebody gets hot,\nthis could be over quickly. Yes! PROBST: Could it be Charlie?\nHe lands a second for Siga. It is now Siga in the lead\nand Yanu trailing. -Yes! Yes!\n-Yes. Q sticks the second for Yanu. We're tied again, two-two. Charlie trying\nto land the third. And he does. Siga back\nin the lead with three. Q. -Oh, Q knocks one off.\n-Oh, no! Now it's Tiff back in, trying\nto make up something for Yanu. -KENZIE: Yes, yes, yes, yes!\n-PROBST: And Tiff gets hot. -Tiff lands a second.\n-You got this, Charlie! -(whooping)\n-PROBST: Charlie has the fourth\nfor Siga. Can he close it out? Just misses. Tiff lands a third. Who's gonna pull it out? It's Charlie and Tiff right now. Charlie just misses. Tiff just misses. Q back in now for Yanu.\nSiga down to their last bag. Q trying to tie it up.\nCharlie trying to win it. Q lands the fourth for Yanu. We are tied again. Charlie and Q trying\nto be the hero for their tribe. -BEN: There it is, Charlie.\n-PROBST: You win it for your tribe or you lose it for your tribe. (overlapping chatter) Right there. -Charlie does it for Siga!\n-(cheering) Siga pulls it out, sending Yanu back to Tribal Council -for the third straight time\n-Aah! this season. And it's all there\non the faces of Yanu-- absolute despair\nat another loss. We were so close. Q. KENZIE:\nYou gave it your all. You were so close. Nami, congratulations. -The winning streak continues.\n-(cheering) Ow, ow! Nobody going home from Nami. Siga, once again,\nimmunity is yours. Nobody going home from Siga. Before I send you out of here, we have a journey scheduled\nfor you today. Nami, you're in charge\nof who goes. You're gonna choose\none person from your tribe, one person from Siga\nand one person from Yanu. So, first tell me\nwho's going from your tribe. -Liz.\n-Liz is going.\n-PROBST: All right. So Liz is going.\nAll right. Who from Siga's gonna go on this journey? I'm gonna go with Ben. -Who's gonna go from Yanu?\n-Bhanu. PROBST:\nAll right, Liz, Ben and Bhanu, grab your stuff, head out.\nBoat's waiting for you. You will return back\nto your camp before Tribal. -Be safe.\n-Love you. Have fun. PROBST:\nAll right, Siga, Nami, no Tribal Council,\nnobody going home. Your reward will be waiting\nfor you back at camp. Grab your stuff, head out.\nEnjoy the night off. -Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you, Jeff. All right, Yanu, nothing to say. Seven days already\nwithout flint. I'm keeping it. Sorry for you. You'll have another chance to win it back\nat your next immunity challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at Tribal. -See you later, Jeff.\n-PROBST: See you later. TIFFANY: Bhanu is absolutely,\n 100%, unequivocally the worst person that could\nhave gone on that journey. Bhanu can't keep his mouth shut. I'm just wondering\n what information he's giving up\n to this other tribe. And I really hope Bhanu doesn't\n get some type of advantage because that's gonna make that\n ten times harder for us to get him out. Survivor is still going strong\nin its third decade because of the people\nwho apply to play. If this adventure\nsounds fun to you, I'd love\nto see you out on the island. If y ou r mo de ra te t o se ve re Cr oh n' s di se as e or ulcerative colitis symptoms are stopping you\nin your tracks... choose STELARA\u00ae\nfrom the start...

Tell your doctor if you have\nan infection, flu-like symptoms,\nsores, new skin growths, have had cancer,\nor if you need a vaccine. PRES, a rare, potentially\nfatal brain condition, may be possible.

Bounce, It's the Sheet. \u266a \u266a All right, who brought\nthe bad karma to this situation? Shocking turn of events, Survivor fans. Yanu got their ass beat again. (laughs) We lost again. How? I don't know. Everything was going so right\nand it still went wrong. But at this point,\n losing feels expected for us. Also, out of\nall the friggin' people that get picked\nto go on the journey, the one who we want to vote out. And I guarantee you his ass\nis up there giving it up. \"Yeah, me and Tiff are in line. \"And me and Q is number one. -Me and Kenzie...\"\n-\"And they all played\na fake idol against Jess.\" -He's spilling our whole game.\n-I know. I know he is up there\ngiving it up, bro. KENZIE:\n Bhanu getting picked\n to go on the journey was just another typical Yanu bad luck situation. The one thing\nwe don't want to happen happens. It's almost like this is some weird Survivor karmic curse that we have. I don't know what's going on. What is wrong with us? That's on me. -I-I'm telling y'all.\n-BOTH: No, it's not. -Stop.\n-No, it's not on you. -No, it's not.\n-Q: Listen, we're... I was put in the spotlight to deliver for my tribe, and I let 'em down big time. I choked at the end\n and I didn't get it done. Now my tribe has\nto go back to Tribal Council and, you know, I feel horrible. Horrible. As a former Division I athlete, I'm built for moments like this. I'm very, very tough on myself because I understand\n that I can do better. Time to be clutch. You weren't clutch, bro. You weren't clutch at all, bro. One bag. Bro, you couldn't sink one bag. You screwed up. Why should they go home?\nWhy should you stay? It takes me back to a time when I was in high school. I was the star player or\nsupposed to be the star player, and I fumbled -with a minute left in the game.\n -(crowd groaning) -(whistle blows)\n -And the other team\n picks it up and win. That following Monday,\n it was huge in the newspaper. \"Burdette fumbles.\" That's a bad feeling. And that is how\n I'm feeling right now. In this game,\n this was my lowest moment. So now I feel like it's up to me to make up for it. I fumbled today, you know? And it don't feel good,\nyou know? -It's-it's tough on me.\n-But it's a bizarre thing. -Q: I know. It was.\n-Like, no one has ever...\nYou couldn't practice that. -But it's not about practice.\n-Yeah. It's about execution. He didn't practice, either. And when the time got down, and it was crunch, he clocked in and I didn't deliver. And for me, that's\nnot-that's not acceptable. So, tonight at Tribal, I'd rather it be me\nthan, like, somebody like Bhanu. (scoffs) Q, surprisingly, became a martyr and was like, \"Vote me out.\" And I can't get a read on it. It's not his personality,\nbut it is. It's very confusing. That's what's so crazy\nabout this game. Like... You don't know what to believe.\nYou don't know who to trust. It's so bonkers. Q:\nI'm serious about this, though. You go on in the game.\nSeriously. I'm-I'm being deadass.\nI'm deadass. Especially after\ntoday's performance, you know? Oh, give me a break\nwith the ... self-deprecation. You know damn well\nI'm not voting you. Q doesn't handle\n these losses well. I think it's because, like,\n he has this invisible pressure that he's putting on himself, because everybody's looking-- well, I'm not looking to him\nfor guidance-- but other people are\nlooking to him for guidance. Like, \"Oh, yeah, Coach.\nTell us the game plan,\" which I think\nis stupid and silly, anyway. Why does my road\nalways have to be the hardest? TIFFANY:\n Why are y'all letting somebody\n coach you through this game that you're supposed\n to be playing for yourself? I think that's dumb.\n I already have a plan. My plan is to vote Bhanu. And fingers crossed that\n he doesn't come back to camp with an idol in his pocket. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a Thank you. I'm so excited. I'm going on the journey\n with Bhanu and Ben. Hi, friends. What's up, crew? My goal is just to see what is really going on at Yanu.\n(chuckles) I'm so curious. Hey, Bhanu,\nif I may just say something before we start chilling. I see you putting in the heart. -Yes.\n-I see you giving your all. Great players have come back\nfrom far worse, and I don't want you to think that's indicative\nof the game you're playing, the situation you're in.\nAnd who knows? We might be able to turn\nthat around for you right now. -But I'm stoked to be here\nwith all three of us, all right?\n-Yeah. I was just thinking,\nit's day seven. Like, congratulations, guys. Thank you. When I prayed this morning,\n was giving gratitude. I asked God, like, you know,\n \"Show me a sign that you exist,\nthat you're listening to me.\" And there you go, the journey. Bhanu, you want to read? -Are you okay?\n-Yeah. (sighs) LIZ:\nWhat? Ooh. -No.\n-(exhales sharply) Talk about\nthings that do not rock. Literally. -(laughs)\n-Okay? (chuckles) Yeah, this is wild. So what does it mean?\nThe white rock sits out? -Yeah. So, you-you get...\n-Yeah. So only -two people move on.\n-You don't get to do anything. This is the end. Bhanu, are you guys okay? I... No, I think, um, tonight's\ngonna be my last Tribal. Tonight's gonna be my last,\nand that's how it's been for me. Would you like a hug? -Okay.\n-Come on, buddy. (Bhanu sniffles) Just remember, you still\nhave a Shot in the Dark, too. -And you still\nmight win an advantage.\n-LIZ: And... -Yeah, who knows? I mean...\n-It's, uh... I'm always on the out and\nnot in any strategy discussions. Tiffany and Q are really tight. -Amen. I can see that.\n-Yeah. -You can see that.\nEveryone can see that.\n-Yeah. And Kenzie's a mastermind. -Kenzie is running\nthe show at our camp.\n-Oh. Kenzie's the one who's actually, like, influencing Tiffany. LIZ:\nThe brains? BHANU:\nYeah, she's the brain. Whatever order she wanted,\nthat's happening. And tonight, it's me,\nbecause, of course, she... she wants to stay in the game. And-and Tiffany and Q--\nthey don't vote for each other. So that-that's my position. LIZ:\n Bhanu has a meltdown,\n so we just let him unravel and he tells us everything. It is a gold mine\nof information. So I just stay quiet and I just let him talk. (sobbing):\nI need a miracle. LIZ:\n And unless he is Leonardo DiCaprio, I cannot not believe this man. BEN:\nThis is a game of emotions. So don't be hard on yourself\nfor being emotional. Make that your fuel. They say that I'm not strategic. They say that I'm-I'm only\nemotional, and I'm a fool. -That's all I am.\n-They said that? BEN:\nThat does not rock. -Oh, my gosh. That's just mean.\n-BHANU: (sniffles) Yeah. -BEN: Strategies are working.\n-BHANU: They said, \"You have to know\nwhen to hold and when to fold.\" I said, like, you know,\n\"I'm playing with my heart.\" I'm not strategic, but my poi...\nmy point being on Survivor is not to win a million dollars. I want to win a million hearts. -That's more important to me.\n-Oh. So I'm here for that journey\nand not for the money. And everyone knows about that. Well, here's one heart. Here's another, dude. Like Bhanu said, \"I didn't come\n to win a million dollars. I came to win a million hearts.\" A little corny, but, like,\nwhen you're raw like that, it hits.\nYou know what I'm saying? That's like an Oasis line,\nfor sure, okay? \"A million hearts\" on three. One, two, three. ALL:\nA million hearts. -All right, Bhanu.\n-Go for it. BHANU:\n I'm hoping for a white rock, because if I lose my vote, I can't play\n the Shot in the Dark. So I want\nto play it safe tonight. This is it. \u266a \u266a ( \u266a \u266a ) Some people just know\nthat the best rate for you is a rate based on you,\nwith Allstate.

The universe\nalways finds a way, dude, okay? LIZ:\nGood luck, guys. BHANU: Liz, Ben and I--\n we put our hands in the bag, and guess what rock I drew.\nBlue. I need to win an advantage\n more than anybody. If I can get an advantage, I can change\n the course of the game. The tides can shift. I just need that blessing. Maybe this is it. (exhales)\nIt's hard when you can't listen to Van Halen for a week. Sometimes you can't\nlook to, like, an idol like Nicolas Cage\nfor your answers.

You're given all these\n different shapes of blocks to form a perfect cube. You know, like,\n three little squares and then\n four or five big squares. The puzzle's fun. Problem is you're only given\n until the timer runs out. Are these all the same? You know, I practice a lot\n of Survivor puzzles at home, but in person,\n these puzzles are... Ugh! (sighs) What am I doing wrong? Well... Aah! Things that do not rock: these giant blocks. Oh, shoot. It has to be like this. It has to\nbe like this. That's a cube. (sighs) Oh... No. God, please help me. I'm panicking now. (sighs) (sniffles) (breathing sharply) That's it. My journey ends here.\n(sniffles) That's it.\nMy journey ends. (exhales sharply) \u266a \u266a Done. (sighs) BHANU:\nI couldn't complete the puzzle. I tried different variations,\n permutations, but I-I just\n couldn't figure it out. And I lost my vote. I lost the advantage. I have nothing tonight. I couldn't save myself. I'm going home tonight. That's for sure. With no vote, you can't\n play the Shot in the Dark. So I think I'm in a... I'm in a deep,\ndeep, deep, deep trouble. Oh!

And I gave him, like, a speech.\nI was like, \"Yo, dude, like, people\nhave come back from far worse.\" -And he just,\nlike, started crying.\n-Aw. Sobbed, and he literally,\nlike, screamed to God, \"I need a miracle.\nI'm going home tonight.\"\n-VENUS: Aw. Aw. -Aw...\n-I could see it in his face... -LIZ: Yeah.\n-TEVIN: That is sad. -He says Q and Tiff\nare their own thing.\n-Yeah. But, like, Kenzie's\ngetting away with murder. Kenzie is the one behind them telling them what to do. Because she's a mastermind,\nhe said. He said, \"I don't know\nwhy they're listening to her.\" And it was, like, intense,\n'cause, like, -he thinks\nhe's gonna go tonight.\n-Whoa. BEN:\nYeah. -Good intel, Ben. Let's go.\n-Yeah, good job. -I said the least, bro,\nabout us...\n-(Charlie laughs) Nobody questioned it. I'm somebody that I think when in life\nyou get given challenges, you can only\nmull about it for so long. So I'm not gonna sit and\n think about not having a vote. I'm gonna think about it, like, \"All right,\nhow am I gonna strategize?\" And then\nwe had to go to a table, and you remember\nthe circular thing? It was like the two circles and\nyou had to count the circles. -Oh, yeah.\n-Yeah. They did the same thing,\nbut with cubes. They didn't tell me my answer,\nbut I don't know, I'm an art student,\nso I think I did okay, but I won't know until,\num, the next Tribal. You know, I hate lying, but, uh, I don't want\n to tell my tribe that I don't have a vote yet, because\n the cracks haven't shown yet. But if somebody says\n they don't have a vote, they're easily\n gonna be like, \"Yo, person without a vote's\ngot to be the one to go.\" -What's at stake?\n-BEN: What's at stake is either have an advantage in\nthe next vote or I lose my vote. -Oh. Wow.\n-CHARLIE: Wow.\n-BEN: Yeah. -Do you know who got what rock?\n-So who got the white rock?\n-BEN: Liz. -Liz ended up getting it.\n-BEN: Yeah.\n-JEM: She ended up getting it? -No, she didn't compete.\n-CHARLIE: She gets nothing. Only the people who competed\nwere at risk for losing. -So Bhanu might lose his vote.\n-BEN: Yeah, but I don't know. There's a chance he could\nhave won today's advantage. KENZIE:\nOh! -Look who it is.\n-Look who's back.\n-Uh-oh. KENZIE:\nHow was it? It was okay. -TIFFANY: What'd you do?\n-KENZIE: What happened? Why you look so sad?\nYou just went on a journey. It should have been fun. Nothing exciting happened. Well, um, it's not like\nwhat Jelinsky described. This time, it said, \"you guys\nhave to draw three rocks. \"One is a white rock,\ntwo blue rocks. \"If you draw a blue rock,\nthen you have to do something and then you win,\nmaybe, an immunity\" or something like that. If you drew a white rock,\nthen you have to go home. Like, go to the camp. -KENZIE: Okay.\n-BHANU: So we did it.\n-You drew the white rock? -That's right.\n-TIFFANY: Damn, daddy. And then, yeah,\nI just came back, and... that's about the tea. KENZIE: Of course,\n in typical Yanu fashion, he gets nothing,\nwhich works for us, because we didn't want him\nto have anything. He drew the white rock. He doesn't have anything. Great for the plan, but it is also just hilarious that, once again,\nYanu loses another thing and gives something else\nto the other tribe. Did they ask you about, like, what you think\nis gonna happen tonight? I said my name is gonna\nbe on the chopping block, because that's inevitable, and, um... Okay. Well, thanks for the tea.\nThat was juicy. The real tea\n is what he gave them about us. I feel like there was more that he might have\n given them, but it doesn't seem like\nhe got any type of advantage\nor whatever from the journey,\n which is a good thing. So now it's not a possibility. It's a definite. Bhanu's going home tonight. Q:\n So you didn't have\n to lose your vote or anything with the white rock? -No?\n-What do you think? You lost your vote? I didn't want\nto tell in front of them, -but I-I cannot lie to you, man.\nIt's, like...\n-Okay. No, no, no, no,\nI'm-I'm with you. Bhanu is just\n in a world of his own. This is too much for him. He has a passion for the game but he doesn't understand\n the game. So he needs a guy like me\n to help him, because, right now,\n Tiff and Kenzie-- they're 100% in with sending Bhanu home. But I have a different plan. I tell you, we have, in this game,\nwe have liabilities and we have threats. In this game, we want\nto get rid of the threats and help the liability\nbecome an asset, which I think\nthat's what you can be. I want Bhanu to stay. In my world, a liability can be an asset if you use it the right way. And I think Bhanu is the liability, but I can\n control that liability. We're not... Kenzie is a threat. A threat can never\n be used to your favor. At some point\n it's gonna come up and bite. So, for me, I want Bhanu\n to stay in this game and for Kenzie to go home. I'm willing\nto put in so much effort to helping you\nbecome the better player. I think once Tiff\nunderstands how much time that I'm willing\nto put in with you, she will\nchange her vote to Kenzie. Kenzie'll go home. BHANU: My game tonight rests in Q's able hands. Put it on me.\nI promise I'll fix it. -Okay? I got you covered.\n-Bro. How much he can do,\n I don't know, but I still believe in miracles. So let's see. -Hear me out.\n-Okay. I've thought about it.\nBhanu will always vote with us. He's gonna vote\n wherever we tell him. We don't know what Kenzie's\n gonna do with herself once she get around\nother people. This dude will play the game that we want him to play. Kenzie is gonna play Survivor. She's gonna get over there, she's gonna make bonds,\n relationships. And if it can get her\nfurther in the game, bro, she gonna\nget rid of my ass, and she'll get rid of you\nto push her way forward. Bhanu has said it over and over:\n\"I just want to make the jury.\" Kenzie wants to win. TIFFANY:\n Q was actually making really valid arguments to the point where, like,\nI'm even questioning, \"Like, dang, like,\nmaybe-maybe he could be right.\" Because me, as a Survivor fan, if I was watching somebody play with somebody\n as charismatic and charming and smart\n as Kenzie... I'm really glad we met. TIFFANY:\n ...I probably would be like, \"Dang. Like, maybe you do\n need to cut that person.\" But me, being a Survivor player, and actually having\na relationship with Kenzie, I feel like\nKenzie and I are close. And while\nshe is savvy and smart, I think she's on my side. Bhanu is a liability,\nbut Kenzie's a threat to me. I-I agree with you\nabout everything you said, but I still... My gut is telling me that\nit has to be Bhanu tonight. ( \u266a \u266a ) I'm getting\nvaccinated with Pfizer's pneumococcal\npneumonia vaccine. So am I.

If you're 19 or older with\n certain chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease,\n or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal\n pneumonia.

Don't get Prevnar 20\u00ae\n if you've had a severe allergic\n reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened\n immune systems may have a lower response\n to the vaccine. The most common\n side effects were pain and swelling at the injection\n site, muscle pain, fatigue,\n headache, and joint pain. I want to be able\nto keep my plans. I don't want to risk\nending up in the hospital with pneumococcal\npneumonia. That's why I chose\nPrevnar 20\u00ae.

I wish you were in the challenge -so I didn't have to be.\n-RANDEN: I wanted to so... When I saw the water,\nI was like, \"Oh, please.\" LIZ:\nAre they putting\nthe tarp up up there? They're collecting firewood. Oh, awesome. PROBST:\nHello. Oh, my God. -LIZ: Hey, Doc!\n-RANDEN: Hey, it's Jeff. So... -Oh, no.\n-No. Here to talk to you. LIZ: We're sitting on the beach,\n talking about the challenge, and we see Jeff and Dr. Will approaching.\nAnd I think, \"This can't be good.\" I'm sure you can guess\nwhy we're here. Randen. It's about your arm. I'm not gonna lie,\nit's not good news. You know, before and after every\nchallenge, we always check. Medical comes in\nand gives you a look. And Will's been monitoring it. After today's challenge, he did a lot more work and research and consulted\na colleague about your injury. Why don't you share\nwhat you learned? DR. WILL:\nSo, Randen,\nwhen you first had this injury, we were concerned initially\nthat it was a pinched nerve. And it could\nbe anywhere from the neck right down to the arm. We thought it was\nbecause of sleeping on the hard bamboo floor,\nand it was lower down in the radial,\nwhat we call the radial nerve. PROBST:\nAnd the radial nerve--\nthat's what allows you -to grip and move, and... Okay.\n-That's right. And we thought that your radial\nnerve wasn't working properly. Essentially, you put it to sleep\nby sleeping on a hard bamboo floor and that's\nwhy your wrist is not working. The thing that's\nbeen concerning me has been this worsening pain\nand tenderness in your neck. When I consulted my colleague,\nwho's a neurosurgeon, -her big concern\nwas this could be a bulging disc -in your neck,\n-(Soda gasps) which presses on the nerve, and that's, I'm afraid,\na very different beast. The radial nerve problem\ngets better by itself, but a disc pressing on\nthe nerve here may need surgery. PROBST:\nAnd the-the obvious problem is that Will can't do that with the kind of assessment\nhe can do out here. You need an MRI. And so, Randen,\nfor those reasons, out of just being\nvery cautious about your health, we are pulling you\nfrom the game. You understand, you don't want to risk something\nthat could be serious. No, I understand.\nI understand, Jeff. I don't want to have\nparalysis of any kind. You know what I mean?\nI got a life to live, so... And it's unfortunate\nthat it's an unknown. It could be this radial nerve\nand you could be okay, -but Will's been doing\na lot of research\n-I know you have. and trying to make sure\nthat we take care of you, and this is the right move. Oh, my God. I'm listening to every word\nthe doc is saying. When Jeff said he's gonna\n remove me from the game, I was devastated. I'd rather have gotten\n voted out, like, fighting, you know, but, uh,\n sometimes there's things that are\n just out of your control. Venus, what are you\nfeeling right now? Honestly, I'm heartbroken\nfor him, Jeff. This has been\nan amazing journey, and he's probably\none of the most amazing people I've ever met. And it's gonna\nbe hard to picture the rest of this experience\nwithout him, and I'm just really upset. So, Randen, what is the feeling?\nYou've got, clearly, a lot of love\nfrom this group of people you've been\nliving with. What's this experience\nbeen like for you? You know, Jeff, uh, the time I spent here, I got\nto know these amazing people. You know, every day was a gift. Nobody in my family history has\never done anything like this. This is an opportunity\nof a lifetime, and I cherish all of you. One of you guys\nbetter win a million dollars and keep\nthe Nami legacy going, winning. You know what I'm saying? -I love all of you guys,\nhonestly.\n-I love you, Randen. -RANDEN: All right?\n-I love you, buddy.\n-Good job, dawg. Thank you. All right, Randen,\nso we have an MRI -already scheduled for you\nin the morning.\n-Oh, that's great. PROBST:\nSo we need to get you\nout of here, transported, so we can get this looked at. As for the rest of you,\nas Survivor always does, it continues on,\nand you are now a tribe of five. All right, let's go, Randen.\nSee you all again. -Hope you feel better tonight.\n-Love you, buddy. VENUS:\n My closest ally's going home\nwith an advantage in his pocket, and it sucks. I'm heartbroken for him, but I'm also very upset that the\none person I could really trust is now gone,\nand now I have no one. And it just feels really ... -Thank you, guys.\n-LIZ: Love you. SODA: Love you, Randen. Bye! We love you! VENUS:\n I am at the bottom\n of this tribe. My days are numbered, and\n I'm pretty much screwed. But honestly, at this point, I've\nrealized, in Survivor, you can't predict anything. (Bhanu crying, sniffling) What are you crying for? I don't want\nto see you like this. I'm-I'm sorry. This... No, I know. I know. (sighs) I'll be honest with you. Like... I have not decided\nto write your name down. BHANU:\nI told you I always\nrespected you all, and sometimes I call you sister, because that-that comes from... straight from my heart, and... Hold up. I know I'm interrupting. I know you got a lot going on,\nbut I've got news -that's gonna impact tonight.\n-Yo, Jeff is here! Hey, Q. Kenzie. -My heart is beating so fast.\n-KENZIE: Mine, too. Well, I came in\nclearly interrupting a passionate conversation.\nI can see it in your face. So I think what\nI have to tell you is going to impact all four of you. Randen was pulled from the game. He's had a nerve situation.\nThere was a lot of concern. So for, you know,\nhis well-being, we had to pull him\nfrom the game, which means one person's loss is another person's gain. No Tribal Council tonight. -Nobody going home\nfrom this tribe.\n-Hug. (laughing) (excited chatter) -Oh, my God.\n-See, buddy, I told you. BHANU:\n My prayer's been answered. I'm not going home tonight. Here I am, saying my goodbyes,\n ready to go, and look what happened.\nMiracle! I wanted to tell you that,\nyou know, I came here because you inspired me\nto be on Survivor, because you're my guru. That's what brought me here. And I never came to Survivor to win a million dollars. I wanted\nto win a million hearts. That's my focus. So I had my speech prepared\nfor you tonight. (chuckles) PROBST:\nNo need for the speech.\nYou might want -to work on your gurus,\nbut I appreciate the nice words.\n-(laughing) BHANU:\n I've been praying all day. And guess what? I'm still in the game, baby. This is the first time\nI'm actually, like, smiling and laughing. (laughs) Q, this game\nis impossible to predict. What does this moment\noffer this group? Second chance, Jeff. You just gave somebody on this tribe a second life, and I'm thankful. Tiff, what's your feeling? I'll be honest with you,\nlike, I was really struggling, because we've been,\nlike, losing people left and right. Literally, like,\nI said a prayer. I'm like, \"God, this is gonna\nbe hard tonight. Can you please give me a sign?\" And then you walk in\nfive minutes later. I'm so happy,\nbecause I do not want any more people from my tribe\nto go home. I really don't. Kenzie, I think\nyou all are on to something with this approach\nthat this is a victory. I just left Randen, who is obviously very sad, and yet that\nis how Survivor works. His pain is your joy. KENZIE:\nYeah, I mean, it...\nObviously, like, my heart goes out to him, 100%. Like, that sucks, but it's like our first win. You know? Like... I hate to relish in that, but\nwe got to relish where we can. You know? Well, Survivor is full of turning points. They often come\nwhen you least expect it. This could be the first positive turning point for Yanu. It is the first positive\nturning point for Yanu. BHANU:\nThis is really a positive turn.\nOh, my... All right, I'm gonna\nleave the four of you to enjoy the sunset. It'll be a very different night. And the game continues. -Thank you.\n-TIFFANY: Thanks, Jeff. -Thank you so much.\n-Okay. All right. Good luck. -Thank you.\n-Thank you. Q:\n Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close\n she came to going home. But this is a win\n for the Yanu tribe. For the first time,\n we're not going to Tribal. We can keep everyone together. All four members. One happy family. And that feels great. Captioning sponsored by\n CBS and TOYOTA.

It's a friggin' lockbox.\n It says, \"The location of the key\nwill remain a mystery until after your tribe loses\n a future immunity challenge.\" Oh, my God. PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... BHANU:\n Tiffany and Q -are really tight.\n-Amen. And Kenzie's a mastermind. LIZ:\n He tells us everything. It is a gold mine\n of information. (sobbing): I need a miracle. Q:\n Bhanu is a liability,\n but Kenzie is a threat. So I want Kenzie to go home. Oh, my God. -LIZ: Hey, Doc!\n-RANDEN: Hey, it's Jeff. PROBST:\nRanden, it's about your arm. Just being very cautious\nabout your health, we are pulling you\nfrom the game. Randen was pulled from the game, which means\nno Tribal Council tonight. (gasps) PROBST:\nNobody going home\nfrom this tribe. (laughing) Q:\n Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close she came\n to going home. \u266a \u266a I can't-I can't believe it. Believe it. I know. I am. We are lucky. For the first time. -For the first time, we're...\n-It took seven days.\nWe're lucky. I think this little break\n really could change the Yanu tribe's trajectory. You know,\nwe've been going like this. All we need is one little spike\nin the market, you know, that's it, to shoot back up. BHANU:\nGroup hug. -I love you guys.\n-I love y'all. -Yeah.\n-I love you. Second chance. We're not out of the race yet. This could be the turning point. We've got a good base, and now we've got\n a chance to build upon it. I'm feeling good about it. Why? I said something wrong. TIFFANY:\nWhat? I said,\n\"Kenzie's the mastermind here.\" I just... That's one thing I said. And they... they-they said, \"Are Tiff and Q, like, close?\" I was like,\n\"Yeah, they're close.\" There's nothing\nwrong in that, right? Is that close?\nIs that-is that bad? I kind of don't really\nwant them to know how close me and Q are,\n'cause then they're -gonna try to split us up.\n-But they always\nsee you guys like this. So they've asked me\nthat one question. I-I'm just, like,\nbeing so clear. So there's just, like... 'Cause then they're\ngonna try to break us up. That's all I said.\nAnd that's it. -Yeah. Yeah.\n-Mm. Huh?! Boy... If you can't realize that going to a journey\n to meet two other people from other tribes,\nand they're asking you questions about players on your tribe,\n that they're pumping you for information,\nyou are a liability. -He going over there\ntelling people that we close?\n-I-I can't. I can't. I-I can't. -There's no more\ngoing back to it.\n-Bro, like... Now, he put a target\non Kenzie back, and he put a target\non both of our back. -He got to go.\n-Yeah. TIFFANY:\n And I wonder what\n you said about yourself. I'm sure he's probably like,\n \"You know, I'm just on the bottom right now,\nand I'm on my way out the door.\" Probably made himself look\nlike some friggin' sob story. And everybody looks like\na big threat except for him. Yep. Done. TIFFANY:\n If I would have voted out\n Kenzie and kept Bhanu and then found out\n all this information, I just would have\njumped headfirst into the ocean. I'd have been so pissed. About the Kenzie thing? About all of it. Did I say something wrong? Q: Not only\n did he put a huge target on Kenzie's back, which I don't really mind. Now the target on my back\nis not only \"curious, young, \"he's athletic,\nhe's a physical threat. \"Oh, by the way,\nadd the fact that... he's a duo with Tiff.\" Oh, man. That \"yes\" had so much meaning. Ah, ... BHANU: I shouldn't\n have said that to them, but I said it in good faith\n because I wanted to be honest with my tribe. (groans) BHANU:\nThe target on Kenzie was on and\nwe were going to Tribal Council. Everything is gonna go\n according to the plan, and me just\nspilling everything out... (sighs) It just messed\nthe whole game for me. And he was like, \"Yeah, that's\nbecause she's the mastermind, and she's\nrunning the show over there.\" Bitch. Target number one,\ntwo and three-- me, you and Q. He just... Aah! Like, I'm so mad at him. -Are you dumb?\n-After we reamed him at Trib-- about the Jess Tribal? He's literally like a toddler.\nLike, when the oven is hot, and you're like,\n\"Don't touch the oven.\" And he does and then he cries. TIFFANY:\nWhy would you ever say that? -In Survivor... -'Cause he doesn't know\nhow to play Survivor. -And...\n-Why did he even come out here? He could have just gone camping. -Like, what was the point\nin him even...\n-Deadass. -If you want to win\na million hearts, go volunteer.\n-Oh, my God. I still want to win and I still want to stay\ntribe strong, but Bhanu -is a liability.\n -TIFFANY: What... a Looney Tune. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I need some help. If I'm taking any wrong steps, mis-miscalculations,\nplease help me. God, may Your blessings\n be upon us. Amen. He can sit there\nand pray all he wants. He's made his bed.\nHe got to lay in it. BHANU\n Yesterday, I really,\n really screwed up, and, um, I-I don't know\nwhat-what to do now. (praying in Sanskrit) So at the crack of the dawn,\n I said my Sanskrit mantras. (continues praying) I'm praying, and I just need\n a glimmer of hope. Om... KENZIE:\n Tree mail time. \"Fun little tests\nbookend this game. \"In between,\nthere's no time to waste. \"Winners are nourished\nby victory. For the losers,\nnot even a taste.\" -It's gonna be food!\n-It's food. Yay! VENUS: \"For the losers, not even a taste.\" -SODA: Our reward is food...\n-Food, food, food. Lord. Jesus. HUNTER:\nOf all the challenges to win... -It's this one.\n-This is the one. SODA:\n Oh, my God. We got tree mail today that said something\nabout being nourished and that we're gonna\ntaste something, and I'm like, \"Ah, a food reward,\" 'cause we're so hungry. -\u266a Get on your feet \u266a\n-(vocalizing) \u266a If you want to eat \u266a \u266a I'm in the mood\n to win some food \u266a \u266a And that's what Nami\n is gonna do \u266a \u266a Because it's morning time \u266a \u266a In Fiji... \u266a As a tribe,\n Randen leaving affects morale. It's our first real loss. \u266a On my mental... \u266a SODA:\n But we definitely\n have to forge ahead. I don't care how much it takes, 'cause I feel like\n I'm queen morale. I try to make people laugh\n and bring people together and do silly things\n that get us forward, because the thing is, we have\nto win 'cause we have to eat. (Tevin vocalizing) (Soda vocalizing) We love a swole,\ndramatic ending. \u266a Hey! \u266a MORIAH: \"Winners\n are nourished by victory. -For losers, not even a taste.\"\n-(excited chatter) (cheering) MORIAH:\n When we saw that we have a reward challenge coming up, our brains melted. We were like,\n\"We're finally going to able to maybe get some food.\" Look how much\na reward has really -upped our spirits.\n-(Maria chuckles) Do you all think that people,\nthey're gonna be like, \"How silly is it\nthat these people have not found an idol yet?\" -JEM: Oh, my God.\n-CHARLIE: Yes. They're gonna be like, \"They're\njust, like, hanging out.\" JEM: Right now,\n nobody knows that I found the Beware Advantage first and that I actually\n have replanted it. I want someone else to find it to kind of send them\n on a wild-goose chase to basically\n get the scent off of me. -MARIA: We should\nhave something by now.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. MARIA:\nJem, you looked in here, right? JEM:\nI did not. Every time that\nwe would go to the water well, I can see it. But my job is to act\nlike it's not there. I was like, \"Yeah, I think\nit might be hanging somewhere.\" MARIA:\nWait, guys. CHARLIE:\nDid you just actually find it? MARIA:\nI literally\njust looked right there. CHARLIE:\nOh, my God. -TIM: Is that it?\n-Yes, it says Beware Advantage. And then Maria spotted it. And I'm like, \"Aah!\" (laughs) And I threw it, 'cause I'm like,\n\"It's the Beware Advantage.\" -If you open it it's yours.\n-Well, we're just gonna peek. We're just gonna have a look.\n\"Beware Advantage. \"If you take it it's yours\nand you must do what it says. Otherwise, leave it.\" MARIA: It's a little kumbaya to, like, be idol-hunting\n as a group, but... I'm gonna go for it, because\nwithout taking this risk, there's no way I'm gonna get that extra advantage,\n if it is one. -Let's go.\n-MORIAH: Oh, my God, Maria. -Oh, dear God!\n-Let's go, Lieutenant Mom. Drumroll. (imitating drumroll) What do you got to do, Maria? It says... CHARLIE:\nOh, boy. -(Jem chuckles)\n-MARIA: Yeah.\n-TIM: It's the same. JEM:\n The hardest part for me\n is for me to keep a straight face, 'cause I want\nto just laugh so loud. Everybody's\n digging under the tree. They're going crazy,\nand they're gonna find nothing. MARIA:\nI'm getting bitten. Oh, my God.\nThere's so many ants in here. -CHARLIE: Oh, God.\n-MARIA: That's the Beware? -JEM: Oh, those are giant ants.\n-MORIAH: Oh, those are... -Oh, those are\nthe dangerous big black ants.\n-MARIA: Yeah, I know. (screams) -Ow.\n-MORIAH: Be careful.\nThose ants are huge. MARIA:\nThe ants are massive. JEM:\n So now there are these giant black ants\nthat started stinging everybody. (screams) -Beware, you're\ngonna get attacked by ants?\n-CHARLIE: Do you want me... JEM:\n In Survivor, your job\n is to play as hard as you can, but it's also okay to have\nsome fun while you're doing it. Who would have thunk?\nGroup idol hunt, eh? JEM:\nWe were just talking about... What? Ah... -MORIAH: Fake idol, yeah.\n-CHARLIE: That'd be wild. -MARIA: That would be funny.\n-That-that would be. Finding a Beware Advantage,\n replanting it, have somebody else\ndig up a tree. Like, that's the fun part. -MORIAH: We all ready?\n-JEM: We'll be back. And my hope is that I'm able\n to pin it on someone else. Yeah, let's go. So I'm having fun on Survivor. So that's exciting. (laughs) -TIM: Great work, Maria.\n-Yeah.

All right, Jeff! -(laughs)\n-CHARLIE: Good morning. Good morning. Let's go! Nice. Oh. PROBST:\nGetting your first look\nat the new Nami tribe. Randen was pulled from the game. -Oh.\n-Oh, man. Oh, my... Hi. All right,\nso just to catch everybody up, Randen was suffering\nwith an issue in his arm. It was a pinched nerve,\nbut our medical team was very concerned\nabout possible long-term damage, so we had to make\nthe tough decision to end Randen's journey in favor\nof his long-term health, which means\nthere was no Tribal Council. Nobody from Yanu went home. That tribe stays intact. TIFFANY:\nThanks, guys. Shall we get\nto today's reward challenge? -Yes.\n-(whoops) PROBST:\n All right,\n for today's challenge, you're gonna paddle your boat\n in from the ocean, collecting a key along the way. Once you reach the shore, you'll use that key\n to unlock four rings. Each player is then\n responsible for getting one of those rings\n up and off that pole. Once you have all four rings,\n you'll dig under a log and race to toss those four\n rings back onto another pole. First two tribes\nto finish win reward. -Want to know\nwhat you're playing for?\n-Yes. Food. Show me food. You want food? You got food. LIZ:\nPB&J! (all exclaiming) Told you. PROBST:\nFirst tribe to finish, ten decent-sized fresh fish delivered to your camp, along with a bamboo cooker\nand a diagram for how to use it. Second tribe to finish, smaller but just as appetizing. -Five decent-sized fish\nwill be delivered to your camp.\n-Yeah, let's go. All right, sit-outs. Nami, you're sitting\none person out. Who's it gonna be? Venus gonna sit out for Nami. Siga, you're\nsitting two people out. Who's gonna sit out? -Yeah.\n-Me and Moriah. PROBST:\nMoriah and Ben will sit out. All right, sit-outs,\ntake a spot on the bench. Everybody else,\ngive you a minute to strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it.\n-(whooping) PROBST:\nAll right, for reward. Survivors ready? -Yeah.\n-Go! -One, two, three.\nOne, two, three...\n-TIFFANY: All right, let's go. You're racing to get that key. BHANU:\nOne, two, three. Great. -Okay, stop, stop.\n-Q: Go. BHANU:\nYeah, keep going, keep going. Siga! Nami! PROBST:\nSiga gets there first. Tim takes a big dump and flips it over. MARIA: Let's go. Let's go. PROBST:\nYou got to flip it back! -Get it, Liz. Go. Jump.\n-Be careful, Liz. Be careful. -Be careful, girl. Be careful.\n-PROBST: Nami at their key. -Kenzie.\n-You got it, girl. PROBST:\nYanu with their key. Tim falls off again.

VENUS:\nKeep it in the middle.\nStay calm. Yes! -That's what I'm talking about.\n-Liz has it for Nami. You're good. Start digging. -BEN: Maria!\n-PROBST: It's now Maria\nfeeling the pressure. -TIM: Just like that...\n-You got this. It's okay. PROBST:\nEverybody else has a ring. Maria, the last person left. CHARLIE:\nWe got tons of time here. PROBST:\nShe's got\nto get it over that pole or Siga cannot\ncontinue in this challenge. Two tribes are gonna win reward. Yanu would like\nto be first for once.

PROBST:\nAll right, Yanu,\nyou've earned ten fresh fish, good size,\ndelivered at your camp. But I know what you're thinking. You don't have flint,\nso you have the option to trade this reward\nfor an earlier one. So if you wanted to trade\nfor the large tool kit and the large tarp and give\nup the fish, you can do that. Those fish will not\ndo us any good right now. So the large tarp and tool kit. Large tool kit, large tarp will\nbe waiting for you back at camp. -Hopefully that will\nchange your lives quite a bit.\n-LIZ: Yeah. Hell yeah. Nami, five fresh fish will be -waiting for you back at camp.\n-Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you. PROBST:\nNami, grab your stuff,\nhead out and enjoy those fish. -TEVIN: Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you.\n-We sure will. PROBST:\nSiga, got nothing for you.\nGrab your stuff, head out. Yanu, grab your stuff, head out. Well done. Welcome to the game. KENZIE: We didn't only win, we demolished. We beat them by a landslide, which is the opposite of what's been happening to us\n this entire time. It's, like,\nthe momentum that we needed. Our core four is finally\n getting it together.

LIZ: When we get back to camp, there were five\nstunningly gorgeous different fish waiting for us. A fish a piece! -Yes!\n-A fish a piece. A fish a piece. LIZ:\n And for me, I am allergic to all the fruit here\n and the coconut. They cause\na real throat reaction. So I know my body needs protein. I know I'm getting depleted. My mouth\nis salivating right now. -I just want to get out here\n'cause I'm very excited.\n-Where's the fish? I really wanted\nto cut and clean the fish because my dad\nshowed me how to do it, and I haven't done it since I did it with my dad. \u266a \u266a I had been trying to go fishing\nwith him for about three years, but I was\n so busy with my career and I kept being like,\n \"Oh, I can't do it.\" You know,\n\"I can't do it. I can't do it.\" And then the time to do it\nis eternally past. My dad passed away about ten months ago. And so I didn't get to fish with\nhim that one last time, so... It was just nice to do something\n today that was just, like... Dad's right here. We had a very\n powerful relationship. When I didn't have a car, he gave me\n his one and only car, so that I could get\n back and forth to high school. And he had no transportation. And he called me\n every single day just to say, \"Hey, how are you doing?\" One of the hardest parts\nabout him passing was that, the day after he passed,\nmy phone didn't ring. -SODA: Wow!\n -LIZ: Wow. We ready. -Beautiful.\n-TEVIN: Here they are. -SODA: Aw.\n-Um, my dad taught me\nhow to do this. And this is, I think, the first\ntime I've done it without him. -But, like, I did it.\n-LIZ: Oh, wow. SODA:\nThat's the way to fish, baby! TEVIN:\n So I was filled with pride\n to know that something my daddy taught me\n is coming into play right now. And I'm about to give\n this thing that I have crafted to these people who need it, which is what he was all about. So he lives on. (gasps) Wow. -Fantastico!\n-We did it! We finally won something. (singsongy): First place.\nWho would have thought? That's crazy. We really\nbodied that whole challenge. KENZIE:\nYeah, we did. TIFFANY:\n We blew those other teams\n out today. Oh, that's real big. But this win\n was bigger than us just winning a tarp and some tools. This could definitely be\n a turning point for our tribe. If we could really\n get our stuff together, we might\nnot have to lose anymore. Go to your right. Go to my... Opposite side of the girls\nright now. I'm exactly at\nthe opposite side of the girls. -Go to the other side\nof the shelter.\n-KENZIE: Go that way. Onto the girls' side. TIFFANY:\nNo, we-- You are on the girls'\nside. Go to the other side. Q:\n I know that if we go\n to Tribal next, Bhanu is the one\n that's going home. But if he's going to be around, I have to make sure that Bhanu is the best player that he can be. Just stay in the moment,\nstay in the current. But I think there's so much that Bhanu don't understand\nand don't know about the game of Survivor. We have to fix\nyour social and strategic game to where it's not a liability. So what I'm doing is taking\n my time to actually train him, and that is my job as the coach. We're having coaching sessions. Hopefully I can teach him how to keep his mouth shut. You need to be thinking\nabout every moment. From here on out, start playing\nconversations in your head. In this game, you have a lot of people\nwho want to manipulate you. They ask you questions\nand they buddy you up. -Mm.\n-And you feel like, \"Oh, my God.\nI got to give something back.\" No, the ... you don't. My training with Bhanu\n is training his emotions, training his speech. So you don't want me\nto talk strategy at all? Teaching him techniques to use in general conversations\nwith others. Tonight, who you voting for? I don't know who I'm voting for. -Would you vote Tiff tonight?\n-Oh, yeah, sure. So you're voting Tiff? So that right there\nwas a bit too much, 'cause you jumped on it\ntoo quick. Oh... Q:\n And I'm teaching him how to talk at Tribal. So, Bhanu, what's going on at your camp?\nWe're merged. This is Jeff talking to you. We're vibing with everybody. You know, it's-it's cool. And when you say \"we,\"\nwho is we, Bhanu? Everybody.\nI'm vibing with all of them. Perfect, Bhanu. BHANU:\nIs that Jeff or coach talking? Oh, okay. Q:\n I'm not very optimistic about his approach\n going forward, but if the little bit\n that I can teach him can help, I'm going to continue to try. What did you learn? Tell me. Ask me the same question, coach. -KENZIE: Just-just tell me...\n-No, just tell her\nwhat you learned. BHANU:\nSo, this is what I learned. When Jeff asks, like, \"Hey, Bhanu.\nSo what's going on?\" I would be like,\n\"Things are good, you know? We're all\nvibing with each other.\" I'm glad you're practicing. I want to practice\nwith you, too. We'll have more sessions. -I'll have more.\n-Mm-hmm. I'll-I'll have it\nwith Kenzie, too. -Kenzie?\n-Yeah? I am helping you. Oh, no, no, no.\nYes, you are now. -I will help you.\n-Yes. I just want to enjoy our win\nfor, like, five minutes. -I want to not\ntalk about strategy.\n-Oh, sorry. I'm just gonna walk away. You have\nthe patience of a saint. I snapped at Bhanu because you are probably\n15 years older than me. Like, I... shouldn't have\nto help you play Survivor. And, of course, Bhanu is like,\n \"I'll just walk away.\" I'm like, \"Okay. Go.\" I'm over it.\n I'm over babying Bhanu. It's so annoying. BEN:\nLet's start with the positives. This was\njust a reward challenge. And I want to say that even in the face of all the insanity, you guys were still a team and I couldn't\nbe more proud of y'all. So, you know, Maria, I know you feel like\nthe weight is on your shoulders because it was\nthat whole situation. But I still did it. -You still did it.\n-Yeah. But, yeah, also, every single\nperson out there believed in you and trusts you and doesn't\nput any ounce of blame on you. JEM:\nAnd we don't even-- -It's just fish, Maria.\nIt's not that big a deal.\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:\nYou know what? As immigrants, success was survival\nfor my family. And so we grew up where we had to be perfect. And so I never wanted to fail. So many times I wondered, like,\n\"Am I enough? Am I good enough?\" You know? And this was, like,\na big, big place... to fail\nin front of a lot of people. Growing up, our parents\n wanted so much for us. They came from Lebanon\n to this country and worked so hard. And so, you know,\nwe-we were pushed hard. We were pushed with this\n sort of fire in us to succeed. And when there were moments in life\nwhen I didn't, you know, I was hard on myself. What I've worked on\nthe last couple years is shedding the shame...\n(sniffles) the shame and the guilt\nbehind not succeeding. And just knowing\nthat it's a moment in time, and that doesn't define\nwho I am. BEN:\nListen, Maria, you're gon-- I know you're\ntaking this loss hard, but it's gonna\nbe a lesson for you in more of that\nletting go of shame. -Yeah.\n-BEN: You know what I'm saying? So either way,\nwhether we had the fish or not, -it's gonna be a positive.\n-OTHERS: Yeah. -BEN: All right?\n-Thank you. (Charlie whoops) Let's not forget,\nwe also have a Beware Advantage we can look for, too. -Yeah.\n-All right? Because of Maria. -All right?\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. JEM:\nThat was good. CHARLIE: This Beware Advantage,\n it drives me nuts because Maria and I\ndidn't get to control this potential really valuable piece of information. -MORIAH: Ready to do this?\n-MARIA: Diggy, diggy. CHARLIE:\n She got so excited that she told\nthe whole damn tribe and, all of a sudden, this whole big group effort is going on. That's reason one\nto be frustrated. I mean, this is insane. This is under a tree. This is, like,\nwe're digging in a tree's roots. Reason two is we can't freaking find the thing. We've dug so far\nunder this crazy tree. -This is a serious hole we dug.\n-This is, like, unreal. CHARLIE:\n And there's nothing.\n So what the heck is going on? Because\n the next most likely option is that someone\nplanted it there. This feels, like, comical. We've dug out as far\nas you can go under the spot. So, like, where is it? Either that\nor somebody's being sneaky -and found it in another tree.\n-MARIA: Someone-- Exactly. BEN:\nJeff, where is this thing, dude? Jeff don't lie. A few fundamentals in Survivor: One: Jeff will never lie to you. Two: Jeff will never\ngive you anything impossible. TIM:\nIf Jeff put this in the tree,\nhe's good, 'cause this is absurd. MORIAH:\n So maybe Jeff is not the reason\nwe're digging there. JEM:\n It's great. My game is going the way\nI intended it to go, 'cause I wanted the suspicion\n to be off of me -and onto someone else. -Ah. What's the suspicion? MORIAH: We're thinking\nTim might've planted it. JEM:\n'Cause, Maria, nobody else was, like, going as hard\nas he was. He's overcompensating to take all the suspicions\noff of him. I mean, that's\na massive possibility. JEM:\n The idea that Tim might\nhave the hidden immunity idol-- like, that's what I wanted. I came to play Survivor, and I'm playing as hard as I can\nwith what I'm given.

Liberty. \u266a Baby: \u266a Liberty. \u266a \u266a \u266a People want to, like, chill,\nlounge, and, uh, you know, Bhanu is a stupid ass. And so, the stupid ass\nis gonna go and do stupid ... I left the camp because,\n all of a sudden, Kenzie-- she just, like,\n snapped at me. I'm being treated like...\nnobody. They're not respecting me. I'm so stupid. I had so much power in the game\nand now I'm like a puppet, and they're the puppet masters. They're like, \"Do this, do that,\ndo this, do that.\" And this is what I get. I've seen all the seasons\n of Survivor as a superfan, but when it comes\n to social skills, it's still not sinking in me. Everyone feels like\n I'm a dumb dumbo. \"Oh, we need to teach him how to walk, how to talk.\" So I became a robot,\nso I'm no longer a Bhanu. I'm just, like, you know, I... They're like puppeteers\nand I'm a puppet. It feels... it...\nI-I don't like that. Take your moment. I'll go apologize.\nI don't want him to spiral. I snapped at Bhanu, and then, because I know he's emotional,\nI know that I have\nto go run damage control so that Bhanu doesn't think\neverybody's mad at him again. Bhanu? I'm, like, one foot\n in front of the other just trying to find this man\n so I can apologize... Bhanu? ...when any other person\n would be like, \"Maybe I shouldn't\nenlist her to, like, \"train me on how to do the thing we came out here\nto do right now.\" But we have to make Bhanu\n feel good because if we go on a winning streak\nand we take Bhanu to the merge, we need him\nto stay loyal to Yanu. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Like, we are a tribe. We want to keep our numbers. We need you\nto be successful at Tribal. Like, I'm here to help you. -Thank you. Thank you.\n-'Cause we need you. And I know it's hard. I feel so bad that\nhere is this old child-man -that needs help.\n-It's okay. I love you.\nAll right, we'll get through it. BHANU:\nKenzie came to me and said like, \"I really... I apologize.\" Makes me feel better. And I was like,\n \"Okay, you know what? Uh, bygones, bygones.\" Thank you for understanding.\nCool. BHANU:\n I can take some lessons. Like, you know,\n I know it's very important for my game,\n for everyone's game. If so many people\n are putting work into me, I think I need\nto put some effort in it. -LIZ: Perfect.\n-TEVIN: There you go. All right, I'm gonna wash shirt,\npants, socks. LIZ:\nIf anybody sees some dirty orange underwear... -TEVIN: Ooh.\n-SODA: Right there.\n-...holler at me. I haven't\nwashed my shorts at all, and then these two undies. I feel like\n my game's going pretty well. There's five people\nin this tribe. I personally feel like\nthere's a solid three with Hunter, Tevin, and I,\n which leaves, on the minority, Liz and Venus. LIZ:\nI found my underwear! Yay! But you have a lot of downtime when you win because\nyou do not have to go to Tribal. Guys, I just realized something. Those two little triangles\nat the bottom of our flag look like slices of pizza. Even though I'm pretty good\n at just being, like, kumbaya, your head has to constantly\nbe in this game. You know, I like\nto check in and stuff, see where people's heads are at. You know I really want\nto connect with you. I want to stay connected to you. And you are\nmy confidant out here. Like, it's 100% me, Liz, you, Tevin and Hunter. There's nothing\nthat this fab five cannot do. If you're even out of the game\nfor a second and you get stuck, that's it. You will be out like a light.\n You'll be gone. -Like, what...\n-I feel like she knows that, like, we are tight, and I feel like that three going\ninto the merge is gonna be super powerful three. And I know this is tight,\nso I'm not worried. Hmm. Soda is a social butterfly,\n as am I. However, she's playing the game\na little too hard for me. -Soda. -TEVIN: There's moments\n where I'm watching her, and it seems like she's having little whisper moments\n behind my back. -We're all vibing, but...\n-Yeah. I'm down for individual vibes\nbecause I love everyone. TEVIN:\n I'm just a little worried\n that she may be playing me just as\n she's playing everyone else. And it breaks my heart to say it\nbecause I do have a connection with her\n that is so deep. But the target in which\n I am seeking to hit now is shifting. And so now\n I need to be the one to get into everyone's head\n and plant seeds. For tribe strength,\nI would rather get rid of Venus than Soda, but you already know that Soda is playing a real... game. I would rather\nkeep our game alive and have a weaker tribe than... So are you saying, just making it seem like\n it's Venus, and then we just\n switch it to Soda? HUNTER:\n I think that's\n the safest 'cause... TEVIN:\n 'Cause she wouldn't expect it? HUNTER:\n She wouldn't expect it. Yeah. I actually have wanted Soda out\nfor a while because she's my competition\nfor closeness with Tevin. So whenever Tevin\n started expressing doubt in Soda, you know, that sounds great to me.\nLet's do it, right? I just want to ask, if we have\nto go to Tribal Council, how do you feel if we were...\nhad to vote Soda? Because my gut is telling me, \"Tevin, you got\nto play the game.\" And if playing the game\nmeans that I have to get somebody out of this game who I think\nis manipulating everyone... To be honest with you,\nI think she's the one to beat. This is great news\n for me because I really have this feeling that if Soda makes it\n to the merge, Soda is on her way\n to final Tribal Council, and I cannot have that. Yeah. TEVIN:\n As far as we're concerned, me, Hunter and Liz\n are on board. Like, Soda got to Go-da. Pa in h it s fa st . So get relief fast. Only Tylenol Rapid Release\nGels have laser drilled holes.

We are tied now. Immunity on the line. There it is for Q. He's got one. Yanu's back in it. Hunter has one for Nami. -Make it two.\n-(whooping) What a comeback this would be. \u266a Nami, Nami, Nami. \u266a And he does it!\nNami wins immunity, safe tonight from Tribal Council! We're looking for one more. Charlie in the water for Moriah. Tim tracked his own buoy down. Bhanu still rebounding for Yanu. TIFFANY:\nCome on, Bhanu! It is taking a long time\nto get that buoy back to Q. Tim scores the second.\nSiga down to one. Bhanu's out, Tiff is in. Yanu once again\nfacing Tribal Council. And Q nails the second. Yanu with an opportunity\nto win it right here. Can he do it? No. PROBST:\nFor the win. Let's go! Siga! PROBST:\nAnd he's got it. Siga wins immunity, sending Yanu back\nto Tribal Council, where the fourth person\nwill be voted out of this game. (cheering) Nami, congratulations again. Immunity is yours. Once again,\nnobody going home from Nami. Enjoy your ceremonial\nleap off of the deck. (whoops) Swim out to your boat. That's what victory looks like\nin the water. Siga, congratulations again. Immunity is yours. Your tribe stays intact. Head out, enjoy the night off. (whoops) (indistinct shouting) (whooping) PROBST:\nAll right, Yanu, same result. Tribal Council tonight. Somebody will be\nthe fourth person voted out of Survivor 46. You know the drill.\nI don't take joy in saying I'm gonna\nkeep your flint, but I am keeping your flint.\nAll right, you have the afternoon to figure out\nwho it's gonna be. And-- sorry for you--\nyou got to swim out. Back in the water. Peace out, Tiff. KENZIE: Wasn't that fun to think\n that Yanu would win an immunity challenge? It was a dream that just got squandered\n before our eyes yet again. But tonight, we're all voting out Bhanu. Q: Bhanu's a great guy,\n but my vote has to go towards Bhanu tonight. TIFFANY: Tonight, I think\n there's only one thing that needs to happen,\n and I think that is Bhanu needs to go home. [ Alarm ringing ] There they are! Everybody get\ntheir banking done? Let's go!

It's not the end\nof the game for us. (chuckles) BHANU:\n Yeah, all three of them-- they're having\n a conversation there. Never once, they talk to me. Never once\n they include me in anything. What are we gonna do\nabout Bhanu this afternoon? TIFFANY:\nI ain't doing nothing\nabout Bhanu this afternoon. It's just the frustration\nof constantly making somebody feel better\nabout the things -that they've done wrong to you.\n-KENZIE: All right. \"It's okay, you put a target\non my back. It's okay.\" \"It's okay, you lied to me.\" No, it's not okay.\nIt's not okay. BHANU:\n The vote is already decided. You know who you're voting. The one person who doesn't\nhave a vote today-- me. Ugh! But it's okay. I need to look for the idol. I need to look for the idol.\nGod, please help me. One thing is for sure--\n I am not going home tonight. If I can find the immunity idol, I can change the course\n of the game. (groans) Jeff, where did you\nput the idol? I'm digging deep here. \"Dig deep,\" he says. \"Dig deep.\" There should be some marker,\nsomething. If I have to climb\n Mount Everest, I will do it. God is listening. Like, today is the day.\n You need to help me. Help me, help me, help me,\nhelp me, help me. ...Jeff hid another idol\non this island?\n-Bruh. -The best he could do\nis save himself\n-That's it. with an idol that he might find, which he won't,\n'cause I have it. Where is this damn idol?! I searched, and now here I am. No vote, no agency. No...\nI can't do Shot in the Dark. Nothing! Wow! What a plan, man. What a plan. You okay? I'm not. Here. I'm mad at myself\nand I'm mad at Him. If this is what You wanted,\nif You wanted to end my story so soon, You shouldn't have put me\non Survivor in the first place. I'm so sorry, Bhanu. I've given it my all\nfor this game. Ugh! (sighs, sniffles) I'm so mad. I'm so mad. Oh. (sniffling) What can I do? Can you find me an idol? Tiff, you need\nto help me to... Please? -No. Please, Bhanu. No.\n-Please, Tiff. Please. Get up off your knees.\nWhat the hell are you doing? -No, I will not. I will not.\n-Ah, bro, please. -Tiff, you need to help me.\nYou know...\n-No. Get up. First of all,\nI'm not gonna talk to you if you're on your knees.\nI'm not gonna do that. -I need you to stand up.\n-Tiff. All right. I'm gonna\nkeep it honest with you. I'm gonna\nwrite your name tonight. I'm just being 100% honest.\nI am writing your name tonight. Can I-can I ask you what...\nthe reason behind that? -Yes. Yes.\n-Please. I feel like I can't trust you. I'm sorry that, you know,\nit has to end like this, but I hope that\nyou can respect the fact that I'm at least\nbeing honest with you. -Gotcha.\n-Can I have a hug? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry\nI screwed it up for us. It's fine, Bhanu.\nDon't be sorry to me. It's fine. (sighs) This is it for me. Nine days is what... ...is written for Bhanu. I have to just accept it. Namaste. Thanks to the island. Thanks to everything here. I realize that honesty\nhas no meaning in this game. A momentary truth caused... so much. I learned a lesson a hard way,\n that, you know, five seconds of my honesty\n ruined my game. That's how hard this game is. But guess what? I figured that I'm such\n an emotional person. I'm a very good person. I'm a loyal person,\n I'm an honest person. And that's what\n my journey's been. I am going home tonight. But tonight, you know what? I'm gonna tell my story because they still\n don't know my story. And I'm so glad that I got\n a chance to play Survivor. It's not about\n the million dollars. All I wanted to do\n is win a million hearts. My m ot he r us ed t o te ll m e a st or y. Of a demon king, and his army. They brought terror\nto the land.

I'd like to go back, since we didn't get to\nhave Tribal last time, and talk about the journey. Bhanu, you were selected\nto go on that journey. How'd that go? I went on this journey and, um, I lost my vote. Not only that,\nbut I revealed that Q and Tiff, when I asked, like, are they working together,\nI said like, \"Yes.\" And then I also said, like, you know, Kenzie\nis a good game player. PROBST:\nTiff, did you ask Bhanu what his motive was\nin giving away this information? TIFFANY:\nYes. I don't know if I've got an actual answer, but it seemed like\nhe didn't understand that by revealing\nthat information, he was putting a target\non all three of us. Like, I just don't think\nhe understood in that moment that he was getting played. PROBST:\nSo, Bhanu, is it that\nyou want to play that way or is part of it figuring out how to play Survivor and\nyou're still figuring it out? Jeff, the first\nsix days has been... Like, I'm not clicking,\nlike how to play the game. Sixth day,\nthe moment it clicked, and then, I spilled the beans\nto my Tribemates. So when I'm trying\nto get the game, the game took over,\nand I dug my grave so deep, I couldn't come out of it. PROBST:\nSo I'm getting a sense that... You're already nodding.\nYou finish. What was I gonna say? That Bhanu\nis going home tonight. -Is that what's happening?\n-Yes. I told Bhanu straight up,\nI'm writing that name down. -Yeah.\n-Yeah.\n-I have to write his name. And Bhanu, you don't have a\nvote, which means you can't play -the Shot in the Dark.\n-No. PROBST:\nIt requires a vote to sacrifice. And this would then\nmake me think that you've all talked about\nidols, and you don't have one. I've searched nine days, Jeff, for an idol, and I've done everything,\nbut I don't have anything. I don't have a vote,\nI-I don't have an idol. I don't have alliances. I screwed up this game big-time. Well, it's rare\nwhen this happens, but I find it intoxicating because there's\nno deception happening. You're not trying\nto blindside somebody. You've all been honest\nwith Bhanu. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: Honest. The word of Bhanu's whole time\nout here-- honesty. So, Bhanu,\nwhat is your Survivor journey? -What has it been?\n-Jeff, the reason why I'm on this show is because I want to share my story. I told them that\nI had a very good life, but that's a lie. (laughs) I was born into poverty\nto a teenage mother, and was abandoned\nby my maternal father when I was three months old. -And where were you?\n-I was in India. After a few years,\nmy mom got married, moved to a different city, and I\nwas living with my grandparents. And can you describe\na little bit -what poverty is like\nin India for you?\n-BHANU: Yes. So, the poverty\nis just like the camp. -That was my house in India.\n-PROBST: Literally? -Like, a thatched roof?\n-A thatched roof, yes. And that's how I grew up.\nI grew up literally on streets. But I learned to be honest\nand help each other, and that's how we all survived. I put in a lot of effort,\nand I am the first one in my entire family\nto graduate from high school, first one\nto have a graduate degree, first one to actually move to United States. And I also found my partner. So, all these things. So, the reason why I wanted\nto be on Survivor is because there's so many Bhanus\nstill out there, still living in poverty. So all the Bhanus\nout there, listen. There is always hope,\nand you can move mountains. And if I can\ncome from that place, a lot of people can also do it. But, unfortunately, this is how it... it's ending, so, it's on me. Thank you so much\nfor this opportunity, and thank you, tribe. -Thank you for\nsharing that with us.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Q:\nYou know, Bhanu, I want you\nto understand, brother, you've done a great job with the man\nyou've become today. And the man that you were\nin our tribe showed us that, man, we could count on you\nfor a lot of things. PROBST:\nYou know, Bhanu,\none time you said to me, I am your guru, -which I took as a compliment.\n-Yes, sir. But also, remind yourself you're your own guru. What you've done\nwith your life is remarkable. And I say this all the time. The game of Survivor is about the adventure, putting yourself\nin this environment to see what you're capable of, and that's what\nyou've been doing. You won my heart, Bhanu, -all of our hearts.\n-Mine, too. Seriously. All right, Bhanu,\nwhen you're ready. Bhanu, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Thanks for being here. Love you, Bhanu.

        "transcript":"\u266a \u266a Oh. I have... the idol in my hand. PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... Choose one more person\nto join you. For me, it's more like who is physically\nfalling apart right now? Liz and Q,\nrock, paper, scissors. -Paper covers rock. Is that it?\n-Yup. Yeah, I know. I'm, like...\nI know. My head is going in 22 different directions. Yeah. And I've been playing this game\n with Maria since day one. But at some point, you have to start thinking\n about your own game. VENUS:\n It's one thing to decide\n who you're gonna take with on a reward,\nbut to start off by saying, \"You know, I really want\nto choose someone who is physically weak,\" and then put on this farce--\nit kind of felt cruel. Twelfth person voted out, the fifth member of our jury:\nVenus. The tribe has spoken. VENUS:\n I was gonna play the idol, but unfortunately,\nI'm going home with it. \u266a \u266a Q:\n Tribal went exactly\n as it should. They say you can see Venus from Earth, but we don't see Venus no more\nin this camp. Venus thought that\n she could rally the troops and send me packing? (scoffs)\nYou can cancel Christmas, girl. That would never happen.\n(laughs) Yeah. -I'm gonna clear this up\nright now.\n-Was it you? I'm gonna blow my ... up. I drew a blank. CHARLIE:\nYou actually\nwrote the wrong name? -You wrote my name?\n-Yeah. I want... That's why I wanted\nto talk to you right now. BEN: Yeah. Yo, for real, not lying, I was not supposed\nto write Kenzie's name down. I was supposed\nto write Venus' name down. And I just had\n a slip of the brain. KENZIE:\nYou literally told me\nyou would never write my name, -and then, like, did?\n-Dude, I... Like, that's, like,\na big blunder, you know? BEN:\n I'm at this point in the game where I haven't been sleeping,\n and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Kenzie has helped me with my night terrors.\nI genuinely blanked. And you know what?\n I just didn't want there to be any tension at camp. You've been so good to me, and I'm like, I can't sit here\nand have you be, like, thinking about that\nall night. KENZIE:\n What do you mean it was an accident, Ben?\n How does that happen? It's not like\nit's Kenzie and Kelsey. It's Venus and Kenzie. Like, how did that happen? Either you're telling a really dumb lie, or you're telling\na really dumb truth, and I'm just gonna... I'm not gonna harp on it. -Is that your first vote?\n-Yeah, that's my first vote. Yeah, from my island bestie,\nyou jerk. -It's okay. I have three.\n-(laughs) Oh, my God. Why? Because she, like, dragged\nmy character through the mud. -Oh, my God.\n-To say it was an act\nand a farce. -Oh.\n-Like, do you know how hard\nthat was to make that choice? -I know. I know.\n-Q: Yeah. She got under my skin\nso bad tonight, and I'm pissed\nat myself for reacting. -Feel like that just killed me.\n-Aw. No. -I don't think\nyou had much of a reaction.\n-No. MARIA:\n At Tribal tonight, Venus came out\n of the gates slinging. I felt like she really\nattacked my character. You know, and it just got to me. -She go home.\n-And Venus just got sent\nto the jury by an almost unanimous vote. Except Ben, apparently,\nvoted for the wrong name, which I have\nnever heard of in my life. MARIA:\nBut now, finally, Venus is gone. We're at final six,\n and this is the time to just, like, go for it. CHARLIE:\nWhat up, final six?! (cheering, whooping) MARIA:\n At this point,\n I've had two wins and a blindside, and... I've been on the right side\nof every single vote. I know I'm a force\n to be reckoned with, so, if they're not trying\n to get me out, then that's their mistake. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a It's getting way harder\n for me to sleep. It's very obvious how weak I am\nthese last couple of days. I'm waking up\nin the middle of the night. (Ben cries quietly) BEN:\n The first time\n I had a panic attack, it was very mental. You know, you're disoriented,\nyou're in the jungle, you don't know what's going on. Now the part that bothers me\n and it freaks me out is my body has a mind of its own. I had an experience camping\n when I was 18 that traumatized me. I woke up screaming\nirrationally, you know, thinking about college,\nthinking I'm gonna die. And it was\n very similar anxieties to what I've been going through\n in this game. KENZIE:\n Ben's panic attacks\n have gotten, like, more frequent,\n and they've gotten progressively worse. I just don't know where\nthis burst of fear comes from. KENZIE:\n So, every night,\n I just hold his hand, and we breathe together, and if he needs to talk it out\nand laugh, we do that. If he needs to just, like, walk around, like, I go with him\n to do that because Ben can't help that\nhe has anxiety attacks. But what I can do is be there\nfor someone who needs someone. And I don't care that\nhe literally wrote my name down. It's just a game. I could never let someone go through something so scary alone. That's not who I am. Do you want a hug? KENZIE:\n Time will pass,\n and the sun will shine, and blue skies are coming. But just be with him\n through the storm, you know? -Morning.\n-Sit right here?\n-Scooch together, y'all. -You guys?\n-We can fit six on the bench. You guys, not to make it about me,\nbut I had a BM. (cheering, whopping) I just dropped five pounds. BEN:\nWhat? Oh, my God. LIZ:\n Day 22! I went to the bathroom! (laughs) I thought I was gonna be\n the first Survivor in history\n to never go to the bathroom the whole time, but I went. I feel so good. I... am ready to play now. I've been talking about turning\n up Liz, and now it's, like, full-on volume 11. Liz is in the game. I have nothing\nweighing me down now. ...my name is not\nanyone else's name. -Yeah.\n-Yes. And by the way, don't... -don't accidentally\nwrite \"Charlie,\" either.\n-Yeah. BEN:\nI'm never gonna\nlive that down... CHARLIE:\nNo, you're not. Even though the game is so, so different\nwith only six people, my game plan is the same. Options. It's like,\n\"Ben, what are you doing?\" -(laughs)\n-It's like, \"This is our squad.\" -BEN: I know.\n-And you're, \"What?\" And right now, I've given myself two pathways on this next vote. I've worked really hard to plant this idea with Ben,\n with Kenzie, with Liz, that we can take out\n Maria and Q. BEN:\n I will say, there's only one bonus to me being\na total idiot last night. KENZIE:\nWhat? BEN:\nIs that I think Maria and Q might think\nthat's, like, a wedge. -KENZIE: Between us? Yeah.\n-CHARLIE: Sure.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n At the same time,\n I could stick with Maria and Q who trust me completely, but part of me is, like,\nwhat if I just do what I set out to do with Maria? That'd be awesome. So, I have to really think about what's best for my game, and it's just such a dilemma at this point. And it's a-a different dilemma than anything\nI've faced this game. You know, I voted out people\n who I've really liked, but no one like Maria, who I've played\n the whole game with, and who I consider\n to be my best friend out here. But I can't be waffling\n back and forth. Now is the time where I have\nto be laser-focused on getting to the end,\n and I have to make a decision.

I know. -We're a little motley crew\nover here.\n-It's working. Whatever you're doing,\nyou're still here. Hi, Jeff. Good morning, Liz. All right, shall we get\nto today's reward challenge? (all voicing assent) PROBST:\n For today's challenge, you're gonna race\n over an obstacle to collect a bag\n containing a ball. You'll then\n cross a ladder bridge, moving that bag\n along a twisting rope. Once your bag is free, you'll crawl under\n one final obstacle. When you reach the end,\n you'll maneuver that ball through a maze. First person\nto finish wins reward. Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? -Yes.\n-Yes, sir.\n-Please. The winner will be taken\nto the sanctuary, where good things happen,\nfor an afternoon -of Chinese takeout.\n-Oh!\n-KENZIE: Oh. You called it. PROBST:\nThose little familiar\nwhite boxes will be waiting over there\nto fill your tummies. -Oh.\n-PROBST: Worth playing for? -Yeah!\n-Absolutely.\n-All right, we'll draw for spots, we'll get it on.\nLet's do this. Ooh. -PROBST: All right.\n-CHARLIE: Dumplings! PROBST:\nFor reward at the sanctuary. -(Kenzie whoops)\n-Survivors ready? (insect buzzing) Go!\nYou're gonna high-step this, -and it's going to burn.\n-Oh! My God, but... PROBST:\nQ making quick work of it. Look at Charlie...\nhigh-stepping it. -(Kenzie gasps)\n-There goes Maria. -Wow.\n-Ben, Kenzie, Liz in the end. Oh, my God. PROBST:\nUntie the first two knots,\nstart moving that bag... through this ladder bridge. You're moving that bag\nalong the rope, and you're moving your body\nacross the ladder bridge. Wherever that rope goes,\nyour bag goes. Wherever the bridge goes,\nyour body goes. We are still very even. Big maze at the end, where anything can happen. It's Maria in the lead.\nShe's won immunity twice. Come on. Go. Maria's across. You're good. Untie that other rope now\nand free that bag. Charlie's good.\nLiz is good. Q is good. Ben's across. -There's Kenzie now.\n-I got it. PROBST:\nCharlie's got his rope\nall the way through. Maria has her bag. She's under that final obstacle. -Q is through.\n-What? PROBST:\nHe's under the obstacle. Ow. PROBST:\nMaria first to the maze. Q right behind her. Get that ball out,\nstart working on it. Pull down to release your maze. Here's Charlie. PROBST:\nIt is Kenzie, Ben and Liz still working to free their bag\nwith that ball. Here comes Liz. -Good luck, y'all.\n-PROBST: Here comes Kenzie. Ben still back there. I'm so bad, I'm laughing. PROBST:\nThis maze requires a nice touch and a lot of patience. Charlie drops, got to start\nagain. You're gonna drop. It's gonna take you a few times\nto figure this out. Here comes Kenzie.\nShe's in it now. Liz is here. She's in it. PROBST:\nBen has his bag.\nLet's go, Ben! Maria making some progress. Q making a little progress. Jeff, you know\nI'm cranking \"Pinball Wizard\" in my head right now. PROBST:\nMaria doing a nice job. She has slowed down. Very patient. Charlie drops again. Aah! PROBST:\nMaria drops.\nShe's got to start again. Q drops.\nEverybody's in it once again. This is anybody's challenge\nto win. (exhales sharply) Ooh, ooh! PROBST:\nKenzie doing a nice job. Now Kenzie and Ben. Nope, it's just Kenzie. And Ben drops. It's Kenzie. Charlie trying\nto make a run at it again, trying to catch Kenzie. Ooh! Okay, come on. -Ah.\n-PROBST: Maria drops. Q gonna start again. Kenzie doing a nice job, making tiny movements. Charlie trying to catch her. Ah. PROBST:\nKenzie still in the lead. Ooh, ooh, ooh! -...\n-PROBST: Kenzie drops. It's Charlie in the lead\nright now. CHARLIE:\nLet's go, Charlie. PROBST:\nLiz doing a nice job.\nLiz is in this. Maria once again\nback out on the maze. Kenzie's out there now,\nmaking some progress. Charlie navigates\none passageway. Liz right on his tail. Charlie getting very close. Liz right there. -Oh...\n-PROBST: Liz drops.\nShe's got to start again! Charlie inching closer\nand closer. He's inside the inner circle. Can he get it to stick? For reward. And he's done it! -LIZ: Oh, wow.\n-Charlie wins reward. -Afternoon at the sanctuary\n-BEN: Charlie! (whoops) -for Chinese takeout.\n-KENZIE: Good job, Charlie. -PROBST: Wow.\n-LIZ: Good game, brother. -(Charlie groans)\n-Get your stinky butt over here. All right, Charlie,\ncome on over. (whooping, cheering) -All right, Charlie.\n-Chinese food. So here's what's gonna happen.\nYou're gonna leave here, -go to the sanctuary.\n-Yeah. Chinese takeout. -Beautiful afternoon.\n-Ah. I'm gonna sweeten the deal a\nlittle bit, and in the process, maybe complicate -your decision, because...\n-Ay-ay-yay. ...after you enjoy\nthe Chinese takeout, you will finish your afternoon\nat the sanctuary with your letters from home. -Oh, God.\n-Oh. LIZ:\nOh. Wow. Sorry, Charlie. PROBST:\nChoose one person to join you. Oh, God. Kenzie, what is it\nabout the letters from home? Because when\nyou're watching Survivor, you say \"You've only got\na few more days. It's not that big a deal.\" Um, yeah, it... I know\nthere are people here with kids, and peo...\nEveryone here loves somebody. Um, my fianc\u00e9 moved our wedding. It was supposed to be yesterday\nfor this, so it would just be really nice\nto hear from him, but I... Charlie, don't, like... it's...\nI'm not gonna hold it against you if you don't\nchoose me. I just... -I'm just thinking\nabout it, you know?\n-I know. (sniffles) Choose one person, Charlie. I'm gonna choose Liz. I know Liz can eat Chinese food. -Really?\n-Her daughter Chelsea is a huge Survivor fan. Those two factors.\nLiz, come on. Oh, my God. BEN:\nAll right, Liz! -(applause)\n-KENZIE: Yeah, Liz. Thank you. All right, Charlie,\nfour people left. You're gonna choose\none more person, which means three of you\nwill go to the sanctuary, three others will go back\nto camp with nothing. CHARLIE:\nHonestly, coming into this, I was thinking the people\nwho didn't eat pizza would come. I'm gonna take Kenzie, and\nI know she had her wedding day. And I'm so sorry\nto everybody else. 'Cause I know\nwhat this is, and... -LIZ: Wow.\n-I'm really, really sorry. PROBST:\nCome on over. -KENZIE: Thank you.\n-(Maria sniffles) (exhales) -LIZ: I'm so sorry, Maria.\n-(sniffles) -Maria, I'm really sorry.\n-Maria, I'm sorry. (sniffles) All right, Charlie, Liz, Kenzie, you're heading to the sanctuary for a fun afternoon\nof food and love. Grab your stuff,\nhead out, enjoy the day. Thank you, guys. Thank you. KENZIE:\nThank you. (sniffles) Maria, all love is good love, but a parent's love is unique. -(Maria crying)\n-It's like no other in that you created these people,\nso your emotion is obviously understood. What is the feeling? What were you\nlooking forward to? I just wanted to see... I just want to see those letters\nso bad, Jeff. (sniffles)\nI understand his decision. I would never wish that decision\non him. It's just, it's breaking my heart in three. All right, Q, Maria, Ben,\ngot nothing for you. Grab your stuff,\nhead back to camp. No problem. MARIA: This reward challenge\n is one that I've been waiting for\n for many days, and I think my tears\nwere just the realization that this is the one\nI've been waiting for, and I knew I couldn't go. It hurts all over.\n It hurts my head. It hurts my heart, you know? Like, I wasn't lying when I said\n my heart broke in three.

CHARLIE: Oh, y'all are the best.\nThis is amazing. -Mmm, mmm, mmm.\n-Oh, my God, you guys.\n-Wow. Sorry. I'm, like, ripping\nopen boxes like a savage. -CHARLIE: No, rip open...\n-Savage! I haven't had a reward in almost ten days, and there's been\n so many feelings. Feelings I didn't even know\n that I had inside me when I don't get picked. Oh, my gosh. That's soda. And today, I'm picked. See, Liz? It all pays off not\ngetting picked for the pizza. -This is better.\n-You know, I thought about that. -We are very lucky.\n-LIZ: I thought it was a series of bad luck,\nand I'm like, \"That was good\nI didn't get picked.\" More than eating, it feels like, \"Yes, Liz, you have done\nsomething right in the game. \"You're working with people that want to work with you,\" and that feels just as delicious as this beef dish tastes. CHARLIE: We got love. Oh, God.\nI can't even think about that. CHARLIE: Oh, I really...\nI really feel for them, but... Obviously, the letters\ncomplicate it, but, like, literally, before the letters, I\nwas like, \"It's Kenzie and Liz.\" Like, obviously, we didn't eat -the last time, so...\n-Right. CHARLIE: Not choosing Maria\n was the hardest decision I've made the entire game. But I knew that\n we were gonna be okay. She is truly a selfless, caring, just stand-up person. I told you, like, my favorite\nplayers are Malcolm and Denise. -Like...\n-Yeah, she's kind of, like,\nthat strong... that strong mom. CHARLIE:\n We've been saying\n we're Malcolm and Denise, and we've built\n such a tight bond over the course\nof this whole season. And one reward challenge, even if it's for love,\nwas not gonna break that bond. I think Maria will understand. I think so, too.\nShe knows, you know... She knows. Mm-hmm. (Maria sniffling) I think the hardest thing...\nis I can... Let it out. Take your time. I can picture them\ns-sending their... writing their messages. BEN:\nYeah. Working so hard\non these letters... ...to get them to me. Charlie and I said,\n if we ever win reward, we are not taking\n the other person. So, I know why\nCharlie chose how he chose, but having my three boys\n at home and not having a way\nto communicate with them... (sniffles) Something died in me... today. I just... I feel like I just got robbed,\nit just got taken from me. This one would have meant... I would have given up\nevery reward for this one. It hurts, it's very painful,\n but, like, I've been in positions before\nwhere I've been broken down, and all I can think of is,\n like, you keep some bear cubs from mama bear. Like, I'm coming. It's gonna really\nlight a fire under me. -KENZIE: Letters!\n -(clapping)\n -CHARLIE: Letters, y'all. Liz! Oh, my gosh. That's my name! -Kenzie!\n-Oh, it's thick! Wow, you guys. -We are loved ones!\n-KENZIE: I know. Cheers. -Cheers.\n-Cheers.\n-Oh, my gosh. Cheers. LIZ:\n I remember coming\n into the game thinking, \"Liz, you really don't want your\n letters because you're gonna have to show this emotional side\nof yourself.\" Aw. Chelsea. But when the letter\n is right there in your face, that's all you can think about. And so, to remind yourself of home and why I came out here\nin the first place and... ...who I left behind. And it feels like motivation. (cries) I see my daughter's letter, and I see her little drawing.\n(laughs) (sniffles) She's the whole reason\n I'm out here. She dared me to apply. (laughs)\n And it just... it reminds me that\n there are people in this game who are not rooting\nfor you, but there are people at home that are. KENZIE:\n I have no idea\nwhat's going on with my parents. I have no idea what's going on\n with my business. I have no idea\nwhat's going on with my fianc\u00e9. And so, getting to, like, hear that they're okay... (sniffles) There's no words to describe\nhow much it means out here. Wow.\nThis is the best thing ever. Thank you, Charlie. Ooh. I was supposed to get married\n literally yesterday, but my fianc\u00e9, when I got\n the first call for Survivor, immediately moved our wedding\nbecause he just believed in me. And it's amazing that I have... (sighs) Sorry. (sniffles) It's just so amazing\nto have a support system that allows me...\nto learn, to go... to do this. You know, like, I'm used to being in charge, I'm used to, like,\n controlling everything. And I'm used to being, like,\n a perfectionist, and... relinquishing that control\nwas a big lesson for me to even come out here. I've been self-employed\n since I was 17. I started my career\n at 15 years old. Like, just because I thought I was the only person\n I could ever count on. But hearing that my family\n can handle everything-- like, it's allowing me to take a break and, like, I don't have\nto be perfect all the time. I don't have\nto be in charge all the time. Like, I can lean\non other people. This really...\nI'll never forget this. -CHARLIE: Oh, my God.\n-Ever. -Thank you so much.\n-CHARLIE: Thank you guys -for being here. (sniffles)\n-LIZ: You're awesome. CHARLIE:\n Every single letter,\n every single one makes me cry and laugh and just get\n that one little taste of home that I need to drive me through. (laughs) It's a bunch\nof Taylor Swift quotes. (laughs) -Oh. From Judy?\n-Yeah. Oh. CHARLIE:\n Getting to hear from Judy,\n my girlfriend, I get to see what she's thinking about this whole\n crazy experience. I miss her so much,\nand think about her every day. I always thought\nthey were, like, all being dramatic with letters, -KENZIE: No.\n-but my God. But if I remember one thing, it's that my sister, my dad, my mom, my girlfriend Judy-- they all told me to play to win. That might be what I needed to push me to make\nthe right decision for Charlie. Because if I'm going to\n play to win, I'm going to be betraying Maria, who I've played\n the whole game with. And those reminders to play to win are gonna fuel me\nto the end of the game. \u266a \u266a CHARLIE: That was amazing. -Oh, lordy.\n-This was the reward\nto win, Charlie. -I know. Wow.\n-That's, like, -such a bucket-list thing.\n-I feel so special. I feel special, too. Thanks, Charlie. LIZ:\n Charlie's choices\n to go on this reward-- it couldn't have been\n set up any better. This is a chance\n for the three of us to actually talk strategy\n without looking suspicious. So, while it would pain me... to not go Q yet again, I do know\nMaria is a bigger threat. Someone just needs\nto beat Maria tomorrow. We have to get her\nbefore Q, right? -Yeah.\n-I mean, as much as that makes me gag. Yeah. -She's so good.\n-KENZIE: Oh, she's good\nat everything. And she made the fire\nlast night. I was like, \"Oh, no,\nyou can make fire, too?\" LIZ: I know. CHARLIE:\n This was by far\n the hardest reward decision of the season. All I can say is thank goodness Maria was not here because I am cooking something up that I don't want Maria\nto sniff out of the kitchen. And that is a blindside\n of Maria at the next vote. I know Ben is solid. So, the key ingredients in this little recipe are Kenzie and Liz, so, I wanted to cement\nthat relationship today. Wonder what they're doing\nback at camp. CHARLIE:\nThey'll probably\nlook for the idol, but I don't think it exists,\npersonally. Yeah.\nWell, let's hope not. Q: Right now, reward means absolutely nothing to me. For me, I need to find this idol\n 'cause I need protection. So the more time\nthat I have to snoop around, which...\nI've looked a lot. They make it look so easy on television. People, I've looked for days. Days... and hours on days. Nothing. But today is different. I've told myself,\n \"Q, calm down.\" Calm for the last\nhandful of days. Handful of. My hand is starting to hurt. I need the storm. And I think I found something that'll help this storm\ncome a little quicker. You just sit right there.\nHold on. Let me go in my pocket. What's in my pocket?\nWhat's... It might be somehow! What's-what's...\nwhat's the matter? What's going?\n Look what I found. Oh, Lord. Oh, my God.\nThis is a beautiful thing. (laughing quietly) I got it. And behold. I got the juice.\nI got the juice now, fam. Oh! Do I tell Maria or do I don't? I just need to get through\n this last vote at six, and I'm in\nthe final friggin' four! Hey. Swear to God. Just found it... -Stop it.\n-I swear to God. MARIA:\nLet me see what it looks like. Q:\n I told Maria\n about the idol because you have to trust somebody. -I'm not telling anybody else.\n-No, no, no, no, no. Q:\n And Maria is my number one. So, now, her knowing\n that I have the idol, she's now\nmore likely to protect me. Yeah, yeah. -Yeah.\n-So... MARIA:\n That's a really nice offer. Like, if I have someone\nwho's telling me he's willing\nto play this for me, I definitely want\n to keep him around. So maybe that's my best move now. I think it's\nimperative Liz goes next. Q:\nYep. We just\nhave to make sure Charlie don't pull a fast one\nwith those girls. I don't think he would. I'm not worried about Charlie\ndoing anything with them. But would Charlie\nneed to go before them? It would make...\nIt would be safe. MARIA:\n This is the first time\n that I've actually voiced out loud to anybody that I'm\nconsidering voting Charlie out. It's a very hard decision, because not only has he been my number one\n since day three, but I have so much trust in him. Charlie is so lovable. He'll beat any of us. Charlie will win, hands down. Q:\n Yep. I honestly do. -Charlie don't win,\nget rid of Charlie.\n-Yep. -Which I'm down to do,\nif you mean it.\n-I'm down to do it, too. -CHARLIE: Hello! How's it going?\n-Hello. MARIA:\n It's a very hard conversation to have, but it's also a reality. He's a threat. I knew why you picked\nwho you picked. -Thank you.\n-It was just sad. And, I mean, I know... It was so sad,\n'cause I know how badly you wanted\nto read those letters. MARIA:\n I adore Charlie so much,\n and Charlie and I have walked this journey together\n with so much compassion and genuine care\nfor one another. And we've really formed,\nlike, a friendship that will go\nway beyond this game. Just so, like,\ngrateful to, like, have you just\nin my life, period. -Thank you for saying that.\n-So... So just... I just really want\nto thank you for everything. MARIA:\n So it's hard to switch\n from that security, that comfort\n and that camaraderie to \"It's my game now.\" Like, it has to be my game. There aren't\n many options anymore for us to be a pair. Was there any strategy talk? Were there any pitches to you? There were. It was much of the same. -Which was...\n-Like, \"Get Q out of the game.\" Okay. CHARLIE:\n Maria's my number one ally. I love her to death,\nbut I've set up this blindside. I feel so many different emotions. And honestly,\nit almost feels like guilt. It pulls on just every single fiber of me. MARIA:\n I think that\n was really important, -strategically,\nis to keep... Yeah.\n-Yeah. Keep them from, like, -talking to\ntoo many people, and...\n-Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. CHARLIE:\n I don't think Maria is considering blindsiding me. MARIA:\n I don't know. Would he ever do it to me? CHARLIE:\nI was hoping\nyou-you would find it. MARIA:\nWell, I tried to go look. I was like, \"I hope\nthat's what Maria gets to do -while I'm gone is,\nlike, find the idol.\"\n-I tried. I tried. It took me a while. Or did we really have plans\nto go to the end together? Am I breaking his heart\nand messing up our plans? I think she's dead serious about taking me to the final three. If anything, I feel like I got\na good friend out of this thing. -You know, whatever happens,\nI feel like,\n-Whatever happens, Maria. -Always.\n-you're such a good person. MARIA:\n The two best buds, Malcolm and Denise,\ncan't go to the end, and I want Malcolm\nto take this one. MARIA:\n Hopefully we get -to keep in touch\nand be in each other's lives.\n-Oh, my God, yeah. Oh, my God. I know it.\nI literally know it. MARIA:\n At the end of the day, Charlie and I will be wonderful\nfriends after this game. -I want them\nto meet Uncle Charlie.\n-And, uh... Yes! Yes. MARIA:\n But right now, he's standing in my way.

He's got to go back. Maria. Look at that. Maria's good. Maria now in the lead. Liz falls. Q falls. Maria in the lead. Everybody\nelse still working on the beam. Kenzie's in. Charlie falls. Maria first to the puzzle.\nBen is across. Building a dolphin puzzle. Liz working on the beam.\nQ working on the beam. He drops again. Charlie's good. Liz is good. Kenzie, that works. Just keep\nyour feet out of the water. -(grunts)\n-PROBST: Kenzie falls. Ben gonna be on this puzzle. Charlie's in this. Liz right behind Charlie. Maria working on the puzzle. There goes Q. He's looking good.\nHe's halfway through. Q with a nice leap.\nYou're good, Q. Kenzie in dead last. Words you do not\nwant to hear on day 23. (groans) Q up, working on his puzzle. Right now it's Maria and Ben, but only\nwith a couple of pieces. We're still early in this. Big stakes. You want to see the final five. You're good, Kenzie.\nGet here. Let's go. Charlie getting the base. Ben has the base.\nMaria has the base. Hey... Liz has a piece. Mark it down. Kenzie's here now. Everybody on the puzzle now,\nwhere anything can happen. If you get a roll going\nand you start to figure this out,\nyou can catch everybody quickly. It's now Ben in the lead,\nthen everybody else. Everybody now looking next door. \"What can I see\non somebody else's puzzle? Which piece do I need?\" Ben with another piece.\nBen is on a roll right now. He's figuring this puzzle out,\nbut it is far from over. Everybody chasing Ben. This would be\nBen's first challenge win. Couldn't come at a better time. But you never know. Any given challenge,\nanyone can win. Maria with another piece. Now Ben's gonna\nfeel the pressure. Maria with another piece. Look at that. We got a challenge! And another piece for Maria. And another piece for Maria! Three in a row.\nMaria now in the lead. Make it four in a row.\nMaria's on a tear. Ben has slowed down now.\nHe had the early lead. Right now, it is all Maria. Amazing. Maria is on fire. It would be her third\nindividual immunity win. Q now gonna just watch. Maria down\nto her last few pieces. It is time to put\nthis one in the deep freeze. Maria down to\nher last piece in this puzzle. Guaranteed a spot\nat the final five. And there it is.\nMaria's done it. Her third\nindividual immunity win, guaranteeing her\na spot in the final five. Wow. That went from competitive\nto a blowout. Maria, come on over. For the third time this season,\nindividual immunity. You are guaranteed\na spot in the final five. We just talked about\nthe fact that this means you are in the finale. Why is that so significant\nto a Survivor fan and player? You know, I think\nyesterday I hit rock bottom, to not get that love from home. And so I thought to myself...\n(sniffles) I was either\ngonna be fueled by love or I was gonna be fueled by the fierce determination\nthat got me here. And so, this win, to me, is just proving to myself\nthat I have that determination, even in the absence\nof love from home. Well done.\nMaria safe tonight. As for the rest of you,\nsomebody going home tonight, 13th person voted out,\nyou become the sixth member of our jury. -Swim out.\nSee you tonight at Tribal.\n-(whoops) CHARLIE:\n Maria winning immunity today, my first reaction was, \"Dang, Maria, you are a boss.\" My next reaction is, \"Well, dang. Maria was\n probably going home tonight.\" So, this is Survivor. What do you do? Adapt. What's the next best\n move for me? And I think, tonight,\n it's not a smoke screen. There's a real fire under Q, and I think his torch\ncould get snuffed tonight. Wh at i f we d on 't ge t do wn i n ti me to get a birthday\ngift for Zoe? Don't Panic.

KENZIE:\n Maria is the biggest\n threat out here. Maria can't keep\nwinning everything, but she does,\nso it's frustrating. So we can't get her out. But I don't want\n to go any further with Q. LIZ: Yep, yep, yep. BEN: Yeah. Yeah. KENZIE:\n I have wanted Q out of my game for a hot minute now, and it's\n just not been happening. So I am ready\n to take down King Q. Like, I want him out of here. BEN: I think every time\nhas been the time to take out Q, but especially this time, 'cause\nthere's only two votes left. And the only reason\n Q keeps avoiding getting voted is 'cause Maria's convincing\n us all to use him as a number, which is really, \"Oh, they're an alliance. How did we\nnot put two and two together?\" We're, like,\nthe four court jesters taking down the king. -Yeah.\n-Finally. BEN:\n Maria and Q think\n they've been running the show for a bit,\n but now everybody's trying to come together as one to take down the king and queen. This is gonna be my favorite\nblindside of the season. Yeah, this one's really good. -Oh.\n-What's the tea? So, thinking about this... Yeah. But... We have to. He's vulnerable now. We got to take the shot\nwhen we can. It's Survivor. The safe move\nis never the best move. Safe move\nis never the best move. I know it's time\n to get out Charlie. But now, I'm removing my number one\nand trusting in my number two. I know you're right, Q. I know he's a threat, and I knew\nthis day was gonna come. If everybody wants\n to bash me for taking Q further in this game,\nthat's their prerogative, but... it's Charlie tonight. So what are we gonna do? We got to go Charlie. Charlie? We got to stick together, Liz. I'm with you. Sounds good to me. Q comes up with this plan\n of getting Charlie out, but, Q, you know dang well I don't want to work with you. Ever since Maria and him\nhave teamed up and he thinks he's back on top, he's just been\n so ridiculously confident. KENZIE:\n But you know what? -I've been ready to get Q out.\n-I've been ready\nto get Q out, too. -For a long time.\n-Yes. Tonight is finally the night\n Q is going home. See you later, brother. What are we gonna say to Maria? I'm just gonna play stupid. Yeah. What do\nyou all think about that? I mean, I'm fine with that. He is kind of the one to beat. -Everybody loves Charlie.\n-Everybody... -Yeah, I love Charlie.\n-If Charlie gets to the end,\nhe wins. -Hands down.\n-Yeah. Like, look at him. -Everybody here,\nhe'll beat everybody.\n-Yeah. Maria thinks Liz and I\n are gonna vote Charlie, but we're just\n bamboozling Maria and Q. I knew this day would come. -We both knew it would come,\nyou know?\n-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. KENZIE:\n And I'm just eating it up,\n because Q feels comfortable. So Q is not gonna\nsee this blindside coming as long as\n Maria doesn't find out. CHARLIE:\n If we take out Q tonight\nand leave Maria out of the vote, she's not gonna\nbe with us tomorrow. Yeah, it kind of weakens her, but if she wins immunity\ntomorrow, which right now, -Looks possible.\n-looks very possible, what happens to us? We have to make sure\nthat we can survive tomorrow. We need to get Q tonight, but we need to be careful\nhow we do it, because... if we leave Maria in the dark, then we go into final five. All of a sudden, Maria can\n team up with Liz and Kenzie and vote out either Ben or me. So the way I see it, we have to bring Maria\ninto the Q vote, which I think\nshe'd be cool with it. -Yeah.\n-I'd have to talk to her, -but I think\nthat makes us the most safe.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n This is why I never close any door\non any relationship to work on.\n'Cause guess what? -I just wanted to talk to you.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n Maria thinks I'm still\n her number one ally. That's the key of my game, is making sure that every side that I've been working with,\nI can still work with. Yeah. Charlie approaches me and says, \"Tonight's the night\n we're gonna get rid of Q.\" And so I nod and say,\n \"I think that's a good idea.\" What I really feel is, \"Please don't look me\nin the eye. I feel so embarrassed.\nDon't look at me like that.\" Um... I mean, what I really feel is, \"I think tonight\nis Charlie's night to go.\" Okay. So... You think we can get everyone\nto write Q's name down? Yeah. MARIA:\n I think the conversation about getting rid of Q is really just\n to appease Charlie and to just distract him\n from any other thoughts. But in reality, Kenzie and Liz and Q and I are gonna be the ones\nthat make the decision. So there's nothing\n Charlie can do at this point. You feeling okay? Yeah.\nI think you're fine. You may get a vote, but I don't think\nyou're going home. Q:\nThank you. -You'll be here tomorrow.\n-Yep. Right now, I feel confident that I have Maria,\n Liz and Kenzie on board to working with me\nto blindside Charlie. -You got a Q-skirt?\n-I've got\na little pocket in my... Rock the Q-skirt! Q-skirt! Q-skirt! (Maria whoops) Q:\nQ-skirt! Q-skirt! Yeah! After tonight's vote,\n and when Charlie goes home, it is safe to say that I've regained control. I don't see how it can go wrong, but here's what I know: the Q-skirt is holding an idol. Can you believe it? Nobody knows about the idol\n besides Maria, so this thing is powerful. And if I feel any spooks or dooks, I'm playing the idol for myself. Period. -Yeah. Yeah.\n-All right, I just\nwant to make sure because... -Are we all good?\n-Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. -I think we're all good\non the same page, right?\n-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Yeah.\n-Awesome. -All right. (whoops)\n-Yeah. -Day 24. Day 25.\n-Yeah. MARIA:\nTonight is a tough vote for me, because when\n I started this game, I said, \"I want to find my person.\" And I found my person,\n and, like, Charlie's been my person,\n but I'm stepping forward. I'm not looking back. This is the right choice for me because at the end of this game,\nonly one of us can win. So it's going to be\n a sad Tribal Council for me. I'm going to see\n my best friend in this game walk out the door tonight,\n and so it's gonna be very bittersweet,\nand I hope I get a hug. (chuckles) WH AT I S CI RK UL ?

Let's light it up. -Jeff, we have\na show for you tonight.\n-(Liz vocalizing) Wow. (Liz vocalizing) Once again, I forgot popcorn. All right, let's start with\nthe reward challenge, Charlie, where you won the reward,\nand much like Maria, you had a big decision to make. It was Chinese takeout. Jeff, it was the classic\nbait and switch is what it was. I thought\nit was Chinese takeout. And then you go,\n\"And loved one letters.\" PROBST:\nSo I said,\n\"I'm gonna sweeten the deal and probably\ncomplicate your decision.\" Yeah, a little bit, you think? -I mean...\n-So you seemed\nto base it based on who had received an earlier reward. That seemed like a very\nsimple approach, but Maria was clearly emotionally upset\nat missing out. Yeah, you know,\nwe talked about it and had some big, long hugs, and I was just impressed with all three of the people\nwho didn't go on the reward, who were just\nvery selfless in saying, \"No, you three go. You know, we'll-we'll\ntalk to our loved ones soon.\" So, it just showed\nhow close we are out here. Even though everyone's thinking of their loved ones,\nwe're forming bonds here, too. PROBST:\nKenzie, what\nwas the love like for you? Because you shared\nthat you moved your wedding to come play Survivor. It's indescribable, like,\nhow much that meant to me. I told Charlie, like, \"This is a day that\nI will never, ever forget.\" Like, hearing from home\nfilled me up so much with just enough gas,\nlike, left in the tank to get me through\nto the end of this game, because we are this really\nweird, dysfunctional family, the six of us. Like, Q and Ben\nare like my brothers who don't speak and they,\nlike, pick on me all the time. Maria's like our aunt\nwho cooks everything. You're like our cynical\ngrandma who's, like, losing it, -but we love her.\n-(laughing) Charlie's like\nour dependable dog. -Like...\n-(laughing) KENZIE:\nLike, we have made,\nlike, this family here, but it's not the same\nas hearing from the people you love so much at home. PROBST:\nAll right, now let's talk\nabout the immunity challenge. Maria wins again, third time, which puts you just one shy\nof an elite group of women who have won\nfour immunity challenges. -And that's in seasons\nthat have 39 days.\n-Wow. PROBST:\nBut when I asked\nyou about today's win, you said it was the drive from not getting the love. Yeah. You know,\njust to be super clear, like, there were no hard feelings\nfor Charlie's decision. Like, I knew exactly\nwhy he chose who he chose, because they needed to eat. It doesn't mean that, like,\nmy heart wasn't broken. And then I went back to camp\nand I cried the whole rest of the afternoon. But what I said to myself was, \"I either let this knock me down \"and take the wind\nout of my sails \"or I'm gonna channel this into this fierce determination\nto win the challenge today.\" All right,\nso you look at the jury. That's five blindsides.\nThey're essential in the game. It's the mark\nof great Survivor gameplay, and you have to play that way. You cannot let the person\nwho's going home smell that they're going home, because there's so many ways\nthey could disrupt the game. But Charlie, when\nit gets down to fewer numbers, does it get easier\nto blindside or more difficult? CHARLIE:\nI think, with fewer people, every vote matters so much more. People are thinking\nabout different criteria for who they're voting out. Are they good at challenges?\nAre they good at making fire? Are they someone the whole\njury's going to vote for? You know, do you want them around camp\nthe last couple days? And since one vote\nholds so much power, it's much more delicate, because if you tell the wrong person the wrong plan or the wrong name,\nit is so easy for them to flip the game on its head. PROBST:\nMaria, it's interesting to me, in that list of criteria,\n\"alliances\" was not mentioned. We've seen seasons\nwhere alliances go all the way to the end,\nand that's your final three. We've also seen seasons\nwhere there's a point where people pivot and say,\n\"I got to make my move.\" I mean, I think\nalliances are important, but I think, like he said, it's\nalso important to think about who's still here tomorrow and who's going to be\non the jury. People are really starting to\nthink more about who could I sit next to, more so than, like,\nare we sticking with alliances? Are alliances shifting? You know, it's-it's\nreally hard to know. Kenzie, that's\ntwo people in a row that have basically said,\n\"I don't know about alliances.\" I mean, I don't know\nabout alliances because, -not that Ben and I have been\nin an \"alliance\" per se...\n-(laughs) but he wrote my name down and told me,\n\"It was an accident.\" -It really was.\n-An accident. -Wait, hold up, listen.\n-Have you ever heard that? -No.\n-So I was drunk\noff the pizza, right? -I can't wait to hear this.\n-BEN: We had... -There wasn't even\nalcohol there.\n-We-we had, like, -six pizzas.\n-PROBST: To be clear, -you had soda. Yeah.\n-BEN: No alcohol. Yeah.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. I also know how to spell Venus. It's a planet, Ben.\nIt doesn't start with K. -It's okay. It's okay.\n-I'm just saying, if we're\ngonna talk about alliances, I think it's\nkind of a wash after that. -(laughs)\n-PROBST: I got to say, Ben, -I watch a lot of police\ninterrogation videos,\n-BEN: Yeah. and if I'm imagining you\nin that room with the camera, and you say,\n\"I was drunk on pizza,\" -I don't think you're\ngetting out of that room.\n-(laughing) -Oh, definitely not, Jeff.\n-I still held his hand after\nhe wrote my name down, but... She's like my Survivor sister,\nso if anything, this is just\nsome teasing, hopefully. Hopef... Q, what's your take\non alliances? Because Charlie didn't\nmention them and Maria said, \"Look, maybe,\nbut there's only six of us, and we're trying\nto get to the end.\" Does that mean\nthat maybe alliances are over unless they're convenient? I wouldn't say it's over, Jeff. I think it's plans in place\nwith a group of people that see for this vote,\nit makes sense. For next vote,\nit might not make sense, but I understand that a vote will be made tonight\nbased off a group that agreed. PROBST:\nHow about you, Liz?\nAgree with that? Yeah. Everyone, since the Hunter\nvote, has voted together. And so, maybe I'm naive. I mean, I think\nthere are more power couples that are together than,\nlike, true alliances. But we're all thinking about\nthat final Tribal Council. And based on Charlie's criteria, I'm not gonna win\nany immunity challenge, I'm terrible at fire,\nand I'm not in an alliance. So... Don't vote for me. (laughs) Charlie, it's interesting\nhearing Liz say, \"The last few votes\nhave been a group of people voting together,\nexcept for the one.\" Sooner or later, you're the one. Yeah.\nLightning's gonna strike. And we're all sitting here, and tonight we might get--\n(buzzes)-- zapped. And, um... This is a group of hardened Survivor players now. This isn't day one Survivor. So, everyone's getting\nfreaking good at this game. So it's hard to tell\nwhere the lightning's gonna hit. All right, it is time to vote.\nCharlie, you're up. \u266a \u266a I hope I got you. Okay. Oh, my gosh. (exhales sharply) Boy, I have been trying\nto get you out for a long time. (chuckles) (Ben exhales sharply) It's been a fun ride. (whispering):\nIt's been an honor and a pleasure working with you. I love you so much, but I have to\n think about myself as we're moving into\n an individual game. I can't wait for the boys\nto meet Uncle Charlie. I'll go tally the votes. (exhales sharply) If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Charlie. Q. One vote Charlie,\none vote Q. Charlie.\nTwo votes Charlie, one vote Q. Q. We're tied.\nTwo votes Charlie, two votes Q. Q. That's three votes Q,\ntwo votes Charlie, one vote left. 13th person voted out and the sixth member\nof our jury: Q. Need to bring me your torch. -Sorry, buddy.\n-Sorry, Q. -Love you.\n-Love you. Q, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Appreciate it, boss. Good game, buddy. See y'all, now. LIZ:\nSee you. -Go get some Tater Tots, babe.\n-Send us a Q-skirt.

There is a twist. -Uh-oh.\n-You're gonna be randomly divided\ninto two groups of six. Two people are going home\ntonight. -Oh.\n-MARIA: Oh, wow. SODA:\nOh. Hunter's Nami, though. Q:\n If Tim wants to go\n against the six, well, buddy, you are going home, and you just don't know it. It could be\na blindside tonight... TEVIN:\nIt's not Nami versus Siga here. TEVIN:\n Tonight, I want\n to make a big move. Vote Soda. I want to be the curator of the\nfirst blindside of the season. Which is why I'm so determined to at least\nbreak one of them off. MARIA:\nVenus is trying really hard, but she's pretty oblivious. Seventh person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Tim. Can I give Tim a hug real quick? \u266a Brotherly love. \u266a The tribe has spoken. Eighth person voted out\nand the first member of our jury: Soda. The tribe has spoken. Yeah, yeah. I mean, listen,\nwe'll get into it now. -Yeah, I want to.\n-BEN: Yeah. -Before everybody\ngets back, too.\nTIFFANY: Yeah. I don't think you guys realize\nthere's, like, not much to hash out.\nIt's, like... Tim was my first friend,\nso it was just, like, a bummer, -you know?\n-Honestly, I know,\nbut still want to chat. Yeah, dawgs, let's go. I lost my good friend\n at Tribal Council. There was this\n unnamed bromance happening, the gruesome twosome twins--\n me and Tim. And it kept me feeling sane\nduring the game. It's funny to cry\nover another dude. And, uh, I definitely think he was... He was my rock, you know? -TIFFANY:\nWhat do I have to go on?\n-BEN: Yeah. What do you have to offer me besides you being like,\n\"We're vibing\"? TIFFANY:\nRight, that's... They just want\nto talk about bull ..., bro. KENZIE:\nAlso, we're all vibing. -I know.\n-Like, everybody here\nis fully down. Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap. -I know!\n-I know!\n-Yeah! Oh, my God. When we got back to camp\n from Tribal, I'm the type of guy\nwho needs to lock in, focus and move forward\n with the next plan. Tim was part of the six, but Tim was also playing\n a Tim's game. So moving forward in this game, I need to figure out if I want to bring in someone else. And with the other tribe\nat Tribal now, hopefully voting out Venus, we have little time to\nfigure out valuable information. (Tiffany and Kenzie laugh) Q:\n It's not okay just\n to come to camp and keke, hee-hee and ya-ya\nand not make real moves. -BEN: And I'm, like...\n-For real? Q: I'm a game player\n and I'm a game changer and I'm going to change\nthe way this game is played. BEN:\nHere we go. KENZIE:\nWho we missing? -(indistinct chatter)\n-What? KENZIE: So we're all expecting\nVenus to be gone, and then guess who waltzes\nher beautiful self in? TIFFANY:\nOh, my God. KENZIE: Venus' name has been\n brought up multiple times. No one really enjoys working\nwith her, no one trusts her. -You want to get into it?\n-TIFFANY: Yes. Absolutely. KENZIE:\nYeah, let's hear it. Yeah. Tiff and I make eyes\n at each other like, \"They didn't do it.\nThey didn't get her.\" -You want to hear the tea.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. Well, surprise, surprise.\nTwo votes against Venus. -Q: Two votes against Venus.\n-TIFFANY: Who voted for you? Tevin and Soda. -KENZIE: Oh.\n-Q: Ooh.\n-TIFFANY: Ooh. ...let's just say a man\nwho claims his entire identity in this game\nis surrounded by honesty and being an honest person straight-up lied to my face\nthe entire day and wrote my name down. And I saw through that and, you know, karma\nbit them in the ass. It was four against Soda,\nand she went home. -Mm-hmm.\n-Q: Damn.\n-TIFFANY: I feel bad. No, Soda took it real well.\nShe gave me a big hug. She was like, \"You got me.\"\nI was like, \"Yeah, I did.\" Then we're like... (laughs) I'm so sorry. (laughs) Venus has taken the accolades, trying to commandeer the fact that Soda's going home\n was her doing. TIFFANY:\nSpicy legs. It was just like... -(indistinct chatter) -TIFFANY:\nYeah, we were just, like... TEVIN:\n I voted for Venus\n because I didn't know if Soda had an idol, I didn't\n know if Venus had an idol, and so that I could say, \"Soda, I didn't vote for you. \"I told you I'd never write\nyour name down in the game, and I didn't.\nI wrote Venus'.\" But I don't need credit. I'll explain my game\n when I get to the final three. So right now,\n I'm letting Venus be cocky because, Venus, you may not\n understand right now, but you will very soon when your torch is snuffed\nand you're going home. Ugh! Look, I thought\nI was a cocky bitch. She was a poison copperhead. Well, she thinks\nit was her idea. -She thinks the idea\nwas her plan...\n-And I told you, my first opportunity,\nI was writing Soda. That wasn't, like,\nan original idea. But it worked,\nwhich is what I wanted. -It did.\n-Went to Maria and Charlie and they voted with us,\nso that's good. LIZ:\n Oh, my gosh. Venus thinks she's a genius. Oh, wow.\n Tevin made a big move. Ever since I met all of you, I've been saying,\n\"Hey, Soda, Soda, Soda.\" And honestly,\n they're taking all the credit. And for someone like me,\n who has a giant ego, it is so hard for me to give them both the play. Well, I'll let it lie\ntill we get her out. Right. LIZ:\n I don't want to get lost in the shuffle of things. So, I have to stop hesitating and I have\n to start taking action or the action\nis gonna be taken on me. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a (laughing) You were a lot more quiet\nwhen you were hungry. I was hungry as hell, man,\nI was saying nothing. I got some ideas\nflowing in this head of mine... -And look.\n-(Kenzie laughs) So the Q Skirt is essentially a hoodie flipped backwards like a pouch of a kangaroo with two pockets.\n It's gonna be the next big thing. I even said, for a man, if you don't want\nto wear no drawers, you just want to wear these,\nyou good. For a woman,\nyou don't want to carry a purse when you go to the amusement\nparks or a fanny pack, you don't want that anymore, -you want a little more swag...\n-Mm. ...get the Q Skirt. -Mm! Come on.\n-If you just want fashion, want to rip the runway\nin something different, -and want to turn it\nto the side...\n-Uh-huh. get the Q Skirt. -Oh, come on, now!\n-And it's coming\nin multiple colors. This Q Skirt here will cost less\nthan a fanny pack, an extra bag,\na sweater, a blanket. -TEVIN: All together,\n-All together. -Oh, dear.\n-It's a one-in-one,\nand it's one for you. -Buy three, get one free.\n-HUNTER: Oh, goodness. TEVIN:\n I don't think it's worth a damn, but I think just because of his conviction,\nI want one. I'm convinced.\nI want a Q Skirt. There we go. I'm definitely doing a Q Skirt\nwhen I get home. -If you a guy...\n-Yup. you just want a little swag, but you don't want\nto carry a bag, -you get the Q Skirt.\n-CHARLIE: Yup. -Why?\n-Will you buy a Q Skirt?\nYes or no? -Sign me up.\n-(laughing) CHARLIE:\n Q is just a really funny guy and someone\n who I am doing my best to stay on his good side because I've learned now that Q isn't just driving votes. He's putting together alliances and groups of people he wants\nat the very end of the game. So, this morning, I have perhaps my most important conversation\n of the game. Man, I tell you, if you ever are playing Survivor, get up at sunrise. Every single major conversation I've had in this game\nhas happened at the sunrise, when everyone's asleep\n in the shelter. That's where the moves are made. Yeah. -I'm freaking itching.\n-Well, Charlie... I'm itching\nto play the game, man. -Let's friggin' do it.\n-Let's do it then, man. Let's go. Let's go. And as we're talking,\n I realize, this is an interview\n for an alliance. So I'm thinking, I want to get hired\nfor this position. You know, I want the job. Maria is going\nto approach you... Mm-hmm. ...about joining\na bigger alliance. -Yeah.\n-This is the first step of me saying, -\"Charlie, I want\nto work with you.\"\n-Yeah. -Yeah.\n-We're trying to get a six. Okay. This is the first time\n that I'm hearing of the six. I knew Q had some master plans, but I was never in, you know, the C suite. I told you, I got\nyour best interest at heart. Yeah. So I've been, uh, trying\nto plant the seed for you to join this alliance\nfor a long time. -I told you, man. I told you.\n-Maria. You got my back. CHARLIE:\n So this mystical, powerful six\nthat Q has thrown together is made up of two Nami--\n Tevin and Hunter, two Yanu-- Q and Tiffany, two Siga-- Maria and myself, the newest recruit. We got to talk, though, 'cause, like,\nthis game is getting crazy. I love the six,\nbut the six isn't impenetrable. The six is probably\nthe... shakiest six -that's ever existed,\nbecause guess what?\n-Mm-hmm. Tim was in the six. Maria seems pretty gung ho\n on the six. She sees it as a guaranteed way to get to the final six, and I see it as a way\nthat I might get stuck with a bunch of people\nI can't beat at the end. Only thing\nwe got to be careful of and watch\nis Charlie getting smart and trying to make a move. -Mm-hmm.\n-Look, I just don't think Charlie has it to try to turn. -You know what I mean?\n-Mm-hmm. -He don't have\nthat killer instinct.\n-No. CHARLIE:\nWe're not the first group of six in Survivor history to say, \"Let's get to the final six\ntogether, then duke it out.\" Something always goes awry. And I have to decide am I what goes awry? (M an ) Ex cu se m e, would you mind taking a picture\nof us? (Tony)\nOh, no problem. (Man)\nThanks. (Tony)\nOh, yeah that's a problem You need Verizon. Trade-in that old thing and get\na new iPhone 15 Pro with tons of storage. So you can take all the pics! So many selfies. A preposterous amount of pano! That means panoramic. And as many portraits of me as\nyour heart desires. (Woman) How about none?\n(Boy) None. (Man)\nYea none feels right. (VO)\nTrade-in any iPhone in any\ncondition and get a new iPhone 15 Pro -\non us. Only on Verizon. Di d yo u kn ow s om e di sh s oa ps don't remove all the grease, even with scrubbing? Whaaat? I just cleaned those! Try Dawn Platinum. It removes 99% of grease\n and food residue.

TIFFANY: Q decides that he wants to play hide-and-seek,\nwhich is no surprise, because Q has been trying\n to play hide-and-seek since we were at Yanu camp. We got enough people now,\nand we all full. Oh, my God. Fine. -Y'all want to play?\n-BEN: I'm in. -We better play hide-and-seek.\n-Q: Hell, yeah.\n-Yeah. TIFFANY:\n And I think\n it's hilarious, because here we are,\nthese grown-ass adults competing with each other\n for a million dollars. And we're like, \"Let's play\nhide-and-seek, y'all.\" Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,\ncatch a tiger by his toe. My mama told me to... I really am a kid. I really\nenjoy playing hide-and-seek. But I'm gonna use this\n as part of my gameplay. But everyone else,\nit's just fun. Ma. Yeah. -I'm it?\n-You're it. I'm not playing around.\nI'm gonna find you all. Q, I'm coming for you. Q:\nI don't think anyone thinks that this was a gameplay move more than \"Q wanted to have fun and be Q\" move. I'm at the boat!\nI'm counting to 40! -Okay, let's go.\n-Okay. (indistinct chatter) \u266a \u266a Q:\n What this game\n is gonna represent for me is who can hide in plain sight the best. CHARLIE:\n...thirty, 31, 32, thirty-three. Survivor is a tense game, and it's nice to just loosen up. You know, sometimes\nyou just got to forget the strategy\n and play a silly little game. ...thirty-eight, 39. 40! Ready or not, here I come! -I did not see you at first.\n-I know. I... CHARLIE:\nWow. People are not half-assing\n this hide-and-seek game. They are diving\n in the tall grass, covering themselves\n with palm fronds, going deeper into the jungle than anyone has ever gone\nin this game. (sing-songy):\nVenus! -LIZ: No. No.\n-CHARLIE: Two down. Two down. How did you see me? CHARLIE:\nI saw your hood.\nThat was good, though. This group of ten\nis competitive as hell. Whitney Houston. Oh, my gosh. VENUS:\nHonestly, Tevin,\nI did not see you. -Yeah.\n-I almost walked right by you. -(laughing)\n-CHARLIE: That's intense. TEVIN (loudly):\nAh! VENUS: Even though it's, like,\n a silly, stupid game of hide-and-seek, and it's meant to be, like, fun and bonding,\n it still reveals a lot about people's\npersonality traits and their underlying talents. Tiffany in the grass! -TEVIN: Oh!\n-CHARLIE: Let's go. VENUS:\n Tiffany-- the fact\n that she hid with a red Buff on her head-\n that just tells me that she's a little sloppy\nand may not know to hide those little details. -CHARLIE: Dang, bro.\n-TEVIN: Oh, Q over there. -No way. You got Q?\n-Where? I'm so proud of myself.\nI found someone. CHARLIE:\nGood for you. Q:\n It was only Liz who actually walked\n in the woods to see me. Bad idea, Liz. 'Cause now I know that you are playing the game,\n you are paying attention, and you do want to win,\nas much as you say, \"It's just a million dollars.\" Oh, Kenzie! No! You got me. -Oh, my God.\n-You guys were like... Q:\n Next, we find Kenzie, someone in this game\n that I know to be a camouflage, blend in, likable person, which shows\n she can go undetected. This was a good idea, Q.\nMy heart was racing. (sing-songy):\nMaria? -Maria's definitely in the well.\n-Maria?! TEVIN: (sing-songy):\nMaria. (sing-songy): Come out,\ncome out, wherever you are. TEVIN:\nWe just want to talk to you. -That's your... Maria.\n-KENZIE: Maria! This one here! (chuckles) I got some camouflage. VENUS: Maria-- super creative.\n Like, she put a little headdress on\n for herself, she blended in. That says to me that\nshe's someone who works well with her surroundings\nand is really adaptable. -If you had a sniper,\nwe'd be gone.\n-(laughs) We need\nto step our game up here. We have 60 seconds. A mad dash,\nor else Hunter and Ben win, and that would suck. TEVIN:\nSplit up. 60 seconds. -Hunter's somewhere stupid.\n-LIZ: I don't know. I already know\nwe're not gonna find him. If I was Hunter, I would\ndefinitely get up in the tree. Q:\n30 seconds, and they're both safe\nand they win the game. \u266a \u266a Q:\nFive, four, three, two, one. Game over! Hunter and Ben win. Where are they? BEN:\nLet's go! -Oh. Damn!\n-Where are you?\n-Where are you? Wait. Ben's over here. CHARLIE:\nOh, my God.\nI can only hear him. -Oh, I see him.\n-Damn, Ben! -BEN: Let's go!\n-KENZIE: Good job! Ben was not found at all in hide-and-seek, which means this guy is capable\nof playing an undercover game, but be very powerful at the end. (whoops) Ben made a mistake. Hunter, you win! -We're done looking!\n-TEVIN: That was fun. -KENZIE: That was really fun.\n-BEN: Come on, dude. KENZIE:\nGood idea. That was fun. -That was so much fun.\n-BEN: Nice going. Hunter's right here! -TEVIN: Oh, my God.\n-(overlapping chatter) VENUS:\nI said he's in a tree. I got Q. -LIZ: Hunter, you win.\n-BEN: That's ridiculous. Q:\n Hunter made a mistake. If I can't find you\nin hide-and-seek, I can't find you in this game. If you will risk going that high in a tree\n for hide-and-seek, you would take a risk and take a shot at me\nif you could. Not happening, boss. Honestly, that was\nthe perfect ending to this game. -That was sick.\n-KENZIE: That was fun. And that's\nwhat hide-and-seek showed me. LIZ:\nThat was fun. I...

I think it might be important\nfor us to have, like, a little debrief chat\nof what happened last night. ...I feel like feelings ran hot\non both sides. -My feelings weren't hot.\n-You were sad. Yeah. -And I think...\n-Thank you for respecting it. Yeah. Yeah. VENUS:\n I was a little uncertain how that Soda vote\nwould be read, because in my mind,\n it really was my vote. I put in the groundwork to get\n all the necessary votes in to lock that down\n and make it solid, and now, I'm kind of the first person\nto pull off a blindside. -You want to know\nhow I pulled it off?\n-Yeah. I never even wanted\nto write Soda's name down. I had a conversation\nfirst thing that morning where she'd said that she's not\ngonna work for me long-term, and I knew\nshe was gonna come for me, so, I... I pulled the numbers\nas soon as I could. -Damn, that's good.\n-I know. And that's... -My God, today.\n-My God, today. (laughs) And in terms\n of damage control with Tevin, I found it\n to be very important for me to air out some of our laundry and to actually open up a line\nof communication with Tevin. Can I ask you, now that\nwe've gotten it out of the way? Like, I don't think\nI've heard you talk, like, strategy-wise,\nlike, what you see for the next phase of the game. -I'm moment to moment.\n-You're moment to moment. Yes, I understand that,\nbut, also, like, Soda was the same way,\nand I guess in this game, like, just, like, for advice,\nis that you need to sometimes show a little bit\nof, like... commitment in a direction. But I think, for at least\nthis next short while, -we would benefit each other\nby being more open.\n-Mm-hmm. VENUS:\n Tevin's kind of like\n a fish out of water in terms of the strategy portion\nof this game. Like, sure,\n he's a social butterfly, but I don't think\nhe really knows what's going on. Like, he seemed very impressed\n that I was able to pull that move on him,\n but to me, it was like, \"How could you not see it coming\nin the first place, Tevin? Like, come on.\" (high-pitched laugh) LIZ:\nOh, whoa. That's a new laugh. (Tevin laughs deeply) She thinks, honest to God, she has pulled off the move that I planned for her. LIZ:\n These two are running around. Venus: \"It's my idea.\"\nTevin: \"Actually, it was mine. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\" (deep, loud laughing) Shut up. (laughs)\nI'm about to pee. LIZ:\n I love Tevin, but I know now people are seeing him\nas the mastermind? She said to me, \"Thank you\nfor respecting my move.\" LIZ:\n He navigated the Soda vote without Soda even knowing. So now, I need to give a signal to the other Tribemates that I'm here to play, too. I love this game. LIZ:\n I'm sorry, Tevin, but you got to go. I know everybody's playing Survivor hard-core right now, but, like,\nsometimes you got to, like, pause the game for,\nlike, three minutes. And hear me out. What has she actually done to make you feel\nthreatened by her besides mentioning your name\nto people -that aren't even\ntaking her seriously?\n-Right. -Who cares?\n-Right. -Let her stick around.\nThat's just another body.\n-Right. TIFFANY:\n Venus thinks\n she's a power player, but she's really not.\n I wanted her out bad, but I think I'd rather deal\n with a nuisance than a threat. So I'm trying to shift\nmy focus now because... the point in the game where you're just getting out\nobvious targets is done. That's the thing.\nI don't know who's next. -That's right.\n-That's the only thing. You got to wait and see how the\nimmunity challenge shakes out and see what the options are. TEVIN:\n Tiffany is in my alliance. However, Tiffany's\n getting shaky. She wants to keep Venus around. So, Tiffany is not lining up\nwith what the six wants, and what the six wants is\nsix to stay strong. Tiffany says\nVenus ain't a threat. I know what you're saying. I said, \"Tiffany,\nwho you want to go instead of Venus then, if you\ndon't want to get Venus out?\" She said, \"Well, let's just\nsee what happens \"in the immunity challenge\nand let's just see who's left and figure it out from there.\" Q:\nMm-hmm. Up until this point,\n Tiff has been my number one ally in this game. But Tiff is trying\n to keep members in this game that are not part of the six,\n like Venus, because she's playing the old Survivor-- take a goat to the end. That's not the game\nthat I want to play. In this game,\n you have to play a Q game. If you don't play my game\n and you want to go off and do your own thing,\n then you're probably not going to last in this game\n a lot longer. And if we feel like Tiff's not\ngonna play get in the six, then maybe Tiff's gonna lose,\nbe sent home. I'm fine with that. Mm-hmm. Q:\n So, I need to confirm that our games are going in two\ndifferent directions, and if so, then Tiff might be the next vote\n if she doesn't win. For me, if I had to...\nif I had to throw out names for who I want to go next,\nit would either be Maria, Ben. Ben is sneaky,\nbut he's not as smart as Maria. And it just comes down\nto that for me. Q:\nTiff has made multiple mistakes. She's trying to keep goats. And now Tiff brought up\n Maria's name. She's in the six, Tiff.\nBig mistake. Right now, the six is just permission for Q to fire. If you bring up a name\n within the six, now you've given me ammunition\n to take you out without any recourse. -From Tiff?\n-Yeah. She's making me super nervous. And-and she-she's really\nabout keeping Venus. Yeah. Tiff said my name,\n and so, if someone in our alliance is putting up\nsomeone else's name in the alliance,\nthey've got to go. -which is?\n-You can't repeat this. Tiff has an idol. MARIA:\nQ told me that Tiff has an idol. I am actually really surprised\n that Q would tell me, that that makes me trust Q even more. So who's our target? So, let's go for Tiff. Got it. MARIA:\n Q's game is all about trust. He does not want\nto feel anybody wavering at all. And so, if you show him\nthat you're trustworthy, he's gonna work with you. The minute you start\n looking shady, you're out. And so, we may have an alliance of five instead of\nan alliance of six. Yes. Right now, this is\n the biggest move yet for me, to now turn on my number one\n ally in the game. -Mm-hmm.\n-TEVIN: Mm-hmm. Q:\nThe ideal is to keep my alliance making decisions\n that I want them to make, under my control, under my rule. It's almost like I'm a mob boss. And they dare not to say a name\nwithin my organization. And if they do,\nsend 'em packing. I send 'em a Q Skirt, though.

All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -Let's do it, Jeff.\n-PROBST: First things first. Ladies, got to take back\nthe necklaces. No! -Here, you take it.\n-All right. KENZIE:\nThanks, Jeff. Thank you, Maria. All right, once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,\nit is a Survivor classic and one I never\nget tired of seeing. You're gonna hold onto a pole... for as long as you can. -(laughing)\n-When you drop... ...you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed -a spot in the final nine.\n-Wow. Losers, Tribal Council,\nwhere somebody will be the ninth person\nvoted out and become the second member\nof our jury. Little something else\nto deal with today. -I knew it. I knew it.\n-How fun. PROBST:\nIn this new era of Survivor, you start with very little,\nincluding no food. And then at a certain point in\nthe game, you're given a chance to earn some food. That day is today. -TIFFANY: Oh, my God.\n-(whooping) -That's a heavy bag.\n-Oh, yes. PROBST:\nEnough rice to last you\nto the end of the season. -Wow.\n-TEVIN: Oh, wow. Here's what it will cost you. Four players... have to agree\nto sit out of this challenge, give up your shot at immunity in exchange for the rice. -And four is the max?\n-Minimum. -The minimum?\nThe minimum, right?\n-PROBST: Four is it. MARIA: Are you willing\nto negotiate, Jeff? -We can't do three?\n-No. Four is the set number. No negotiating, Jeff? PROBST:\nI'll give you an option. Four of you can agree\nto sit out, or two of you can agree... to give up your vote\nat tonight's Tribal Council and still compete and still have a shot\nat immunity. I'm gonna say, \"Hell, no.\"\n(laughs) Well, it really comes down\nto the same thing. Where does everybody feel\nthey sit in the game? How comfortable are you\nwith your alliance? PROBST: Talk about it. Is anyone thinking immediately, -\"I'm sitting out for this?\"\n-No one want to sit out? -Nope.\n-No. Wow. Nobody. So before we even go further, Charlie, what does that say\nabout where Survivor 46 is? Everyone out here\nis a competitor. We played hide-and-seek -for nothing.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\nNot for immunity, not for any advantage,\nand people were diving into tall grass. You know, Hunter climbed\n20 feet up in a tree. You know, these people are here\nto compete. And when you give us this, which is one\nof the Survivor classics, -nobody wants to sit out.\n-Yeah. I'll be one. PROBST:\nOkay. -I haven't eaten.\n-Okay, so we've got two. Liz says \"I'll sit out.\"\nQ is volunteering to sit out. We just need two more and this rice is yours. If we give you\nan immediate third, -would you give us the rice?\n-No. It's four.\nFour is not even half. That's fair in this game.\nVenus, you're shaking your head \"no,\"\nwhich I understand. Explain why. VENUS:\nOnly one person\nwill win this challenge, and I have a very good feeling\nthat that person could be me, so I don't want to step out. Is there anyone who'd step out,\nlike, in a pair, two at once? -They just don't...\n-Are you willing to step out?

The only way\nto be certain in Survivor-- absolutely certain--\nis to have that necklace. Kenzie already\nadjusting her position. Liz is going down\nto a smaller foothold. -Q is first out.\nImmediately, Liz is out.\n-(grunts) I can't do it.

Well,\nI'd be a peacock, Jeff. I mean, I don't see a peacock\nin the ocean that often, but I think if I had\n to be any kind of bird...

Longer than 20 seconds. -My God, today!\n-Oh! -Oh, yeah.\n-TIFFANY: That's right. KENZIE:\nDamn. TIFFANY: That's all right. Yeah, no Q skirt for you, Jeff. (laughs) No discount, no nothing. (Maria laughs) Not really. You? Yeah. I found a couple\nof rotations that work for me. PROBST:\nCharlie sliding down even more. And Charlie looks like\nhe's about to give in, but he's hanging on\nby his fingers. -Don't let go, Charlie.\n-Keep on going, baby. That's how you do it\non Survivor, Charlie. Just a little tease.

All right, Hunter! Well-earned. -LIZ: Great job, brother.\n-PROBST: Immunity is yours. Safe tonight at Tribal Council. Cannot be\nvoted out of this game. Guaranteed\na spot in the final nine. -Yes.\n-As for the rest of you, after 16 days,\nthat's gonna be it for somebody. Tonight at Tribal, somebody will\nbe the ninth person voted out, become the second member\nof our jury. You have the afternoon\nto figure out who it's gonna be. Grab your stuff, head out. See\nyou tonight at Tribal Council. -Congrats.\n-TEVIN: Thank you, Jeff. HUNTER:\n I'm ecstatic about winning. I was surprised\nwhen people didn't sit out. 'Cause there were\na few people I was like, \"Do you really think\nyou have a chance to win this?\" But as of right now, my game\n plan is to vote for Tiffany. It seems like\n everyone's on board. And now, like,\nwe have an opportunity to take care of it, so why not? I don't see why anyone\nwould want to change it. \u266a \u266a It a in 't m y da d' s ra zo r, Da d. Ay watch it!

LIZ:\nAll that tree time paid off. -(laughs): Yeah.\n-Yeah. \u266a \u266a Q:\n I'm frustrated. Like, the challenge has pissed me off so much because we gave up rice. -All these people that want\nto \"try the challenge.\"\n-Let it out, babe. Bro, it-it was...\nit was just idiotic. This man,\nin a game of hide-and-seek, chose to hide in a ... tree. -Oh, Hunter?\n-You think you gonna hang on a damn pole\nlonger than Tarzan? Get the hell out of Dodge. They can cancel Christmas, I ain't think they gonna\nhang on that damn pole longer than that boy. (whoops softly) Tell me how\nyou really feel, baby. -(laughs)\n-Real mad.\nThat was a bad decision, man. Now we have to go out\n and try to find food. It doesn't affect the vote.\n It is time to send Tiff to the jury because she broke my rule. If you target\n anybody within the six, you go home. We talked about it\na little bit earlier. You still want the same plan or\nyou want to do something else? We already knew what was up. We already said,\n\"Hey, if Tiffany doesn't win immunity today, she's gone.\" She's messing\n with the six alliance. Therefore, she got to go. Okay. We got three right now.\nI know... TEVIN:\nMaria would go for it.\nCharlie would go for it. You think Liz would go for that? -Yeah.\n-That's all we need. TEVIN:\n In addition to the plus-one\n alliance, I believe that Liz would vote with us, as she has\n in the past Tribal Councils. So, if this plan goes down, Tiffany will be blindsided\ntonight. How's it going over here? All I know is I'm thinking... \"Liz... \"...do you just want\nto stay in the game... -Or do you want\nto play the game?\n-Right. Do you want to -play the game? Yeah.\n-LIZ: \"or do you want\nto, like, play -and have a ... shot?\"\n-MARIA: Yeah. -LIZ: I mean,\nI'm just gonna say it.\n-BEN: Say it. If this gets out, like,\nI'm gone tonight. -MARIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. I want Tevin gone. I love Tevin.\nWe've been number ones, but he made\na really big move with Soda. Do you think that he's the most\nlogical threat right now? LIZ:\nYes. I, personally,\nI would like Tevin out. I want to blindside Tevin. I've realized who Liz is,\nand Liz is a fighter. -Yeah. Yeah.\n-Let me just be real with you. I'm looking back at the last\n 15 days, laughing at myself at how many times\n I let someone else take the lead, and... I'm done with that. It's got to be Tevin tonight. -Okay. -Thank God. Finally, people have\ncome to their senses and have realized\nhow big of a threat Tevin is. From what I'm hearing... Okay. And I think if we all,\nmaybe, work together -and try to get Tevin...\n-Okay. we could probably\nform a comfortable, maybe, chill alliance\nfor a vote or two. -Okay. -Tevin's got the social charisma like I've never seen. He's so likable.\n In real life, amazing. In a game where we're\ncompeting for a million dollars, got to go. Game time, brother. Also, the Yanu three has been driving\nso many votes in this game, and right now, I don't want to be leading all of the votes\nto put a bigger target on Yanu. -Liz... Liz wants...\n-We got to vote for Tevin. -Liz is on board.\n-Ben just told me\nthe same thing. -Okay, good. We're voting Tevin.\n-... yes. But if it gets back to Tevin, -it's gonna be...\nThat's how easy.\n-And that's why... and as... But, also, he has an extra vote, so he could flip that\non any of us. KENZIE:\nYeah. TIFFANY:\n Tevin is a huge threat. Also, Tevin has\n an extra vote in his pocket. And the deeper we get\ninto the game, the more power that extra vote\nis gonna have. What's up with you? But right now, Q and I have\n a great working relationship. We share information freely. I absolutely\n cannot leave him out of a vote at this point in time. Everybody who I spoke\nto today is saying Tevin. -Everybody.\n-Who? Liz the one who brought\nTevin name up to me. And she said that she spoke\nto Charlie, Ben and Maria, and they was with it. She was like, \"Listen...\" Well, I'm gonna\ntell you right now, if you don't vote Tevin,\npeople gonna be looking at you next.\nYou better get on board. Q:\n The idea of a plan being changed last-minute doesn't really sit well with me. Tiff was telling me\nabout the plan. -Yeah.\n-Is that real coming from you, -or is that just talk?\n-Yes. You talking about T? -Yeah. Yeah.\n-That's real? I feel like just about\neverybody's on board. Q:\n I'm not the driver\n in the Tevin vote. And my game is based off\n me being in control. So I wanted\n to gain control again. Everybody you think is working with us have flipped. Tevin is the one\nthat's going home tonight. -They're voting for Tevin?\n-All of 'em. -Every single person\nin this camp.\n-Okay. We can't stop it. So there's no need\nto even bring it up, -because then they gonna\nknow I said something.\n-Uh-huh. -You see what I'm saying?\n-Mm-hmm. I ain't trying to ... my game\nover trying to save one person. -Mm-hmm.\n-But I know\nif we write Tiff name down, -she's gonna be here tomorrow.\nShe's not going home.\n-Okay. Hunter... HUNTER:\n Q says it's actually Tevin, and we don't\n have the numbers anymore, but it just seems\nso off the wall for me. Tevin's good\n for all of our games, and we made an alliance\n based off of Andy Griffith. (whistling a tune) HUNTER:\n I want to keep Tevin here. And so it's like, I've got to go and do this damage control and get ahead\nof what's going on, so it doesn't just\ncompletely destroy my game. Q:\n Hunter walks right past me\n to go to talk to other people. And I'm like,\n \"Oh, man, this guy, he's doing exactly what\nI did not want him to do,\" especially moments before going to Tribal. Venus, can we\ntalk to them real fast? Can we chat\nwith them real quick? -Oh, without me there?\n-Yes. Q:\n I made a mistake,\n and now this plan is all screwed up. I should have\nkept my mouth shut. The reason we targeted\nTiff is because she, like, went after Maria. Tevin never did that. I guess the decision is,\nare we fine with Tevin leaving right now? He trusts us so much\nthat the guy's just sitting back there\nthinking it's all fine. (whistling) -Y'all... I mean...\n-CHARLIE: No, no, I-I hear you. I hear you. I'm thinking. Anticipating chaos. VENUS:\nFor the first time in my life. I've never seen that man\nrun to someone and talk trash. Oh, he just...\nNow he's gesturing over here.\n Now he's gesturing -over here again.\n-KENZIE: So, we still have the numbers, right? -Yeah.\n-Definitely. VENUS:\n The plan is Tevin. There's peace in the castle.\nThe kingdom is calm. But now all I see is\nthis conversation on the beach, and my radar is going off. Something's afoot. All right, bro. There are no rules.\nI can go sit there. Hi. What's up? LIZ:\nVenus, I love you. I'm really sorry.\nI have to talk to them. I know that's gonna\npiss you off. I'm sorry,\nbut y'all also realize the sun is setting,\nand we all have talks. So, like, can y'all wrap it up\nin the next few minutes? -Yes.\n-Sure.\n-Thank you. CHARLIE:\nYes. (laughs) Charlie, I want to know\nwhat you think. -You seem really upset.\n-CHARLIE: I'm not upset. No. I'm just feeling, like,\nall the whiplash of today. -It's, like...\n-So then you guys\nwant to go back to Tiff? Like, is that\nwhat you would prefer, or... -Listen, I'll do whatever\ny'all want, at this point.\n-Yeah. I know, but we got\nto come together as a whole. I would rather keep\nthe original and go Tiff. LIZ:\nY'all do whatever you want.\nI'm voting Tevin. CHARLIE:\n I have no freaking clue what's gonna happen because of this chaos\nthat's been whipped up at the 11th hour. -So, so...\n-I don't know what the heck's... CHARLIE:\n Half of the tribe\n wants to get out Tiff. The other half wants\n to get Tevin out of the game. And, at this point,\n Maria and I are at another crossroads. In my eyes, Tevin\nis the better option than Tiff. Tevin orchestrated\n the Soda blindside, but this threadbare alliance of six is thinking\n about voting out Tiff because Tiff threw out\n the name Maria. And, ultimately,\n Maria's my number one. This alliance has zero legs.\n It's going nowhere. It's the loosest use of the word\n \"alliance\" that has ever existed,\n but, once again, Maria and I have to commit and we have to make a decision.

It's 16 days\nwith very little food. Q, you tried. You were the first to say,\n\"I'll volunteer.\" Wisely so, 'cause you were\nfirst out of the challenge. Has there been\nany discussion about that? I had a bit of a temper tantrum\nback at camp, after. I was still upset and mad. I mean, I think five people\nwere out within two minutes, and there was only gonna be one\nwinner and one loser tonight. So everyone suffered\nwhen I think the odds were in their favor to feed\neverybody for another nine days. Liz, another thing\nthat is very difficult to try to understand\nuntil you're here is what hunger after 16 days\nfeels like. Are you surprised that the group couldn't make a deal? I was surprised that Q sat out. I thought I was gonna\nbe the only one to step up because I can't eat coconut,\nI can't eat papaya. Even some of the rewards I have barely been able to eat. I haven't even\ngone to the restroom yet. Oh. PROBST:\nTiff, is the rice negotiation just an indicator\nof where this game is? TIFFANY:\nOh, absolutely. Nobody feels safe enough\nto step out. Everybody feels like they need\nto compete for immunity, and that was blatantly obvious. They said food is not\nas important as safety. But, Jeff, I want to stop before we get deep into the Tribal. The only person that's\ngoing home tonight is me. And I'll tell you why. Wait, wait, w... You mean\nyou're predicting your vote out? Yeah. Well,\nI don't think anyone here coming into the Tribal Council\nwas voting for me, but I'm gonna ask\neverybody to vote for me. Then all of these nine folks\nare going back to camp today. I feel like... -Let me\njust interrupt real quick.\n-Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. -(groans)\n-PROBST: Is this news\nto everyone? -Yeah. What is going on?\n-What the hell?\n-Totally. Q, what are you talking about? So if someone goes home tonight, and it wasn't the right way,\nbecause, like I say, there's probably\nfive people here right now who are like,\n\"Who the heck am I voting for?\" because of mistakes\nthat I made in the game. And I want everybody to start\njust playing the game hard. You have a new beginning. -Kenzie, it's clear\nwhat he's saying, right?\n-Yeah. To everyone. He is saying,\n\"Vote me out.\" Is that clear to everyone? -It's clear, but, like, what?\n-Yeah, it's clear,\nbut it doesn't... -TIFFANY: But it\ndoesn't make sense.\n-But I don't understand why. TEVIN:\nThe math isn't math-ing,\nbecause I've talked to Q, and I know that Q is here\nand he wants to play the game. And I guess it's just\nkind of out of the blue, and it's just very unexpected. It's not something\nthat was even hinted towards. -I mean, it is\ncompletely off-brand.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. And yet, Ben, we just talked\nabout how competitive. It's so competitive, you wouldn't give up\nyour shot at immunity for rice. And here's somebody saying,\n\"Guess what? Merry Christmas.\" You know, Q and I did not\nget off to a great start, but everybody knows\nhe's been playing hard and in a genuine way. So it's like this... th... Even me, who's been, like, kind of skirting around him, is like, \"Uh, what?\" This is actually,\nlike, probably the most bonkers thing\nI would have expected tonight. (whispering indistinctly) PROBST:\nTiff. I'm very confused, Jeff. I don't know where\nthis is coming from because I've known Q since I got here,\nand Q's a competitor. So this is completely, like,\ncoming out of left field for me. It's-it's not me giving up.\nTrust me. I want to play, and I've been\nplaying since day one. But again, when something don't sit right with me and I feel partially\nresponsible for it, I got to own up to it and say,\n\"You know what? I'm not gonna steal\nsomeone else's joy and dream,\" especially in this game, where\nyou only get an opportunity to potentially play once. -And...\n-I think you can own up to it, person to person,\nwithout leaving the game. -And I don't think\nanyone wants you to go.\n-(overlapping agreement) -Yeah.\n-And I-I know y'all don't, but someone is going\nto get voted out because of last-minute\nthings that happened, and I feel partially\nresponsible for it. And I'm big enough\nto say that I want you guys to go on and play.\nI'm serious about this, now. I want y'all to go on and play, but start playing the game. 'Cause everybody\nhave a new opportunity. PROBST:\nSo, Kenzie, on one side, Q's volunteering, which means\nnobody else here is going home. On the other side, Q is a vote,\nand he's probably in an alliance with one or two or three\nor who knows how many people. So that also\nwill impact the game. KENZIE:\nYeah. Q's saying,\n\"Go ahead. Fresh start.\" What if you were a part\nof my plans five plans from now? That's not a fresh start for me. That's undoing the plans\nthat I've been building. Like, it's gonna be\nwacky no matter what. Like, it's not, like,\nwe're gonna go back to camp and be like,\n\"Well, Q's gone. No worries.\" -Like, \"We're all kumbaya.\"\n-Because all we gonna do is go\nback with a bunch of questions. -We know exactly\nwho you were talking to last.\n-But we can't get answers... Jeff, but at the same time,\nQ is a grown man, and this is a game\nfor not one dollar, not $1,000, but one million. And if someone wants to\nwalk out of the game willingly, then I am not going to\ncoddle them to say, \"Stay.\" (whispering indistinctly) -Can we talk?\nCan we talk for a minute?\n-LIZ: Can we talk? Yeah. It's your Tribal. Oh, boy. (whispering indistinctly) I guess we're\nat a live Tribal, Jeff. I don't know. It's like, \"Dude, what is up?\" TIFFANY:\nI don't understand why... MARIA: Okay? This does not rock. (short chuckle) Kenzie, come here. My... \u266a \u266a Wow. I don't know who. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Okay. Never seen anything like this. All right. In one of the craziest\nTribals ever, it is time to vote. Q, you're up. \u266a \u266a That was the dumbest thing ever. Dumbest Tribal ever. Oh, my God. At this point,\nI don't know if this is the real plan, the fake plan. This is what I was told. And we want\nto flush the extra vote tonight. Whatever. I'm as confused as hell. I don't know\nwhat the hell going, Q, but clearly you been out\n of Mississippi too damn long, 'cause your brain is gone. But we can talk about that\nwhen we get back to camp. I'm gonna put this down. Give me some good luck. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Venus. Tevin. Venus. Two votes Venus, one vote Tevin. Tevin.\nWe're tied. Two votes Venus,\ntwo votes Tevin. Tevin. That's three votes Tevin,\ntwo votes Venus. Tevin. That's four votes Tevin,\ntwo votes Venus. Tevin. That's five votes Kevin,\ntwo votes Venus. Ninth person voted out and the second member\nof our jury: Tevin.\nThat's six. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. CHARLIE:\nThat was so shocking. -Y'all can go\neat worms and slugs.\n-(all chuckling) -CHARLIE: Tevin, we love you.\n-TIFFANY: Love you. -Love you, Tevin.\n-LIZ: Love you, Tevin. -BEN: Tevin, you rock.\n-Y'all say that now. Oh, this is so exciting, Jeff. (laughs) Okay. I'm sorry. -Tevin...\n-Yeah? the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Good job, brother.\n-Good luck, y'all. Tevin, you rock. This doesn't rock. \u266a Oh, yes. \u266a Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by\n CBS and TOYOTA.

        "transcript":"Welcome to the season finale\nof Survivor 46. Well, it's been a fun and unpredictable season\nof Survivor. We've had a lot\nof strong players taken out-- including six straight\nblindsides-- forming our jury. We've had five players voted\nout with idols in their pocket, including\nthe last four in a row. That's a record. And to date, it's been 23 days\nthey've gone without rice. Also a record. But now we're down to five. Tonight we'll have\ntwo immunity challenges, two Tribal Councils,\none fire-making showdown. And then our final three\nwill face the jury and we will crown a winner\nof Survivor 46. We'll then immediately\ngo into the aftershow while we're still here\nin beautiful Fiji and talk about it all. All right, our final five: Charlie, Maria, Ben, Liz and Kenzie. Who will be\nthis season's Sole Survivor and take home the check\nfor a million dollars? This is it. Season finale, Survivor 46. \u266a \u266a Oh, my God. (laughing quietly) And behold. PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... MARIA:\nHopefully, we get to\nkeep in touch -and be in each other's lives.\n-Oh, my God, yeah. MARIA:\n I adore Charlie so much, but right now, -he's standing in my way. -CHARLIE: I am just so grateful to, like,\nhave you just in my life. I love her to death, but if I'm going to play to win, I have to vote her out. PROBST:\nMaria down to her last piece. And there it is. Maria's done it.\nHer third individual immunity win. BEN:\n Now everybody's trying\n to come together to take down the king and queen. -LIZ: Yeah, I love Charlie.\n-Yeah. Maria thinks Liz and I\n are gonna vote Charlie. -I knew this day would come.\n-KENZIE: Yeah. But we're just bamboozling\n Maria and Q. All right. Tonight is Charlie's\n night to go, and I hope I get a hug. PROBST:\nIf anybody has an advantage or an idol\nand you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member\nof our jury: Q. \u266a \u266a The tribe has spoken. Congratulations on making it\nto the final five. One of you will claim the title\nof Sole Survivor and the million dollars\nthat goes with it. \u266a \u266a (cracking) Charlie, can we go talk? Oh, yeah, of course.\nWhere you want to go? MARIA:\n Oh, my God. I messed up.\nI messed up tonight. I tried to take out Charlie, my closest ally. But my big move didn't pan out. And, yeah, I have to do, like, major damage control. -Yeah.\n-...to tell me that\nif I sat next to you at the end, I was never gonna win. They pitted me against you\nand did a bait and switch and made me vote for you\nso I look like an idiot, and now Q's gone. I'm, like, nauseated just trying\n to explain myself to Charlie, and I'm really worried my best friend in the game\nis never gonna forgive me, and my game is done. -That threesome\n-Mm-hmm. -that's up there\n is out to get us.\n -Yeah. -MARIA: They messed up\n the alliance\n -Like... -No, no.\n-I trusted the most\nand now it's tainted. You know what? There's no reason\nto call the party off. I still want to party, okay? Because we're down\nto five people, and guess what? -We just got to think\nhow we're gonna play this.\n-Okay. CHARLIE:\n Final five by the skin of my teeth. Ooh! Maria, my number one ally, came for my throat. You know, it'd be easy for me\n to be bitter and upset, but let's be real.\nIf she didn't win immunity, I was planning\non doing the same thing. I'm sorry.\nGod, I screwed up. -God.\n-What the heck, Maria? -Man.\n-What the heck? I'm sorry. CHARLIE:\n Maria feels terrible,\nshe feels bamboozled, but it's completely fake. I know it. She came for me\nand I came out on top. -(laughs)\n-I totally screwed up. -Damn. -CHARLIE: But if one thing\ncame out of tonight, it's that I'm a big threat, and people are willing\n to write my name down. So, I have to keep every path\n open, keep every option open, to get to the end and go for the win,\ngo for the million. -We made final five.\n-CHARLIE: Honestly, -that was a great Tribal.\n-KENZIE: That was a great... And, Liz, you finally\ngot your wish to vote Q off. -Mm-hmm.\n-BEN: You think\nthat was just Liz's wish? -Oh, no, I doubt that.\n-And that's what's up. (laughing) Q, my darling, you got played. I'm so excited! That was honestly\na really good move, guys. Y'all are playing way harder\nthan I thought. Yeah, we could have\ntold you that, but we didn't. MARIA:\nYeah, I know. LIZ:\n Maria says she finally sees that we are\n actually playing the game. Just a face.\nI don't even have words. Just a face for that. But at this point in the game, Maria has a giant target\n on her back. Q ruined my game tonight\nand I fell for it. -BEN: Yeah. Damn.\n-Y'all want\nto let me win tomorrow? MARIA:\n I am on the bottom, and now, you know,\nthere's a massive target on me. Winning tomorrow is imperative. Like, this is the time\n to just, like, go for it, to fight as hard as I can,\nand hopefully either win or go down fighting. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a Come on in! Mighty fierce-looking\nfinal five. Going back to day one, nobody would have predicted\nthis five. No, no. But here we are. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -Yes.\n-First things first, Maria. -Oh.\n-For the third time,\nI have to take it back. -(applause)\n-One more, Jeff.\nI got one more in me. PROBST:\nWhoa. That was a big prediction. (laughs) All right,\nfor today's challenge, you're gonna race\n through a series of obstacles. Once you're through,\n you'll retrieve a rope and use it to drop a bridge. You'll then cross that bridge\n and retrieve a key, then climb to the finish,\n where you will use that key to unlock your puzzle pieces. Once you've finished\n your puzzle, it will reveal the solution\n to a combination lock. First person\n to solve their combination and bang their gong... wins immunity, guaranteed a spot\nin the final four, which means you cannot\nbe voted out of this game. At the very least,\nyou're making fire for a shot to get to three. In addition, playing for reward. -I knew it.\n-Want to know\nwhat you're playing for? -Yes.\n-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah. The winner will be taken\nto the sanctuary, where good things happen,\nfor pasta... -Oh.\n-Caesar salad, -Oh. Nice. Yes.\n-garlic bread, -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\n-macaroons, chocolate pudding, -Mm-hmm.\n-wine and soda. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be\nthe 14th person voted out, become the seventh member\nof our jury. Everybody knows this.\nI got to say it. Maria, if you win\ntoday's challenge, -you join an elite group\nof four women.\n-Wow. The only four women\nin the history of Survivor to win four\nindividual immunity challenges. A lot at stake.\nDraw for spots. We'll get it on! -Here we go.\n-PROBST: Here we go.\n-Let's do it, let's do it. All right, here we go.\nFor a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going\nthrough a muddy net. -You're gonna\nget covered in mud.\n-LIZ: Oh, my God. -It doesn't matter.\nIt's day 24.\n-(Charlie groaning) You want to get to day 25. Right here! Everybody struggling\nthrough that net. Charlie's gonna be out first.\nUse the water if you need it. You're gonna need your eyes\nto see. Ow! -PROBST: Kenzie's through!\n-Ooh! PROBST:\nMaria's through. Ben is through. Now you're pulling out rope\nto release that plank. The only way through\nis to pull that plank out and then cross. Here comes Liz. Everybody working\non their ropes. Every second could count\nin this challenge. Charlie down to his last bit. Plank's out. He's good. Maria's got her plank out.\nShe's good. It is Maria and Charlie at opposite ends. Here comes Kenzie. Charlie through\nthe next obstacle. Maria's through it. Charlie's dropped\nhis monkey's fist. Maria has hers.\nHere comes Kenzie. Now you've got\nto drop your bridge, using that ball of rope. Kenzie has hers! -Ooh. Yay!\n-PROBST: She's in this. Here comes Ben. -Liz now in the tunnel.\n-(grunting) Ben's got his. He's good. Maria with a nice toss.\nThat's gonna do it. Maria first to drop her bridge. Charlie drops his bridge. Now retrieve your key. We are neck and neck right now with Charlie and Maria. Here comes Liz. -Aah!\n-PROBST: Ben a little short. Maria has her key.\nShe's heading up. Maria now in the lead. Charlie has his key.\nHe's heading up. Kenzie drops her bridge,\nworking on her key. Now you got to climb up and unlock those puzzle pieces. Ben and Liz still working\nto drop their bridge. Liz has her bridge dropped. Ben's got it. Liz heading up. Kenzie has her key. Ben working on his key. Liz looking for her key. -Ugh!\n-She forgot it. -Ugh!\n-She's got to come back down\nand go get it. Maria working on her puzzle.\nKenzie working. Charlie working.\nBen has his key. He's up top now,\nworking on his puzzle. Liz had to go all the way back. She forgot her key. Day 24, final five challenge, huge stakes. Reward is secondary. You want immunity right now. Here comes Liz\nheading back up again. We're gonna have everybody\non the puzzle. Another complicated Survivor puzzle. It'll give you\nall the information you need to solve that combination lock. Then you bang that gong\nand you're good. Kenzie making a lot\nof progress on this puzzle. Charlie getting\na little more momentum now. You cannot slow down. Do not stop digging right here. We are very close.\nKenzie and Maria. Maria with another piece. Kenzie down to six pieces. Maria at nine. Kenzie with another piece. And another. Kenzie down to four pieces left. Guaranteed spot at four. Everybody else\nvulnerable tonight. Kenzie, one piece left. She's got the puzzle done. -Oh, my God.\n-Now what? \u266a \u266a New twist in this challenge. You think the puzzle is the end,\nbut it's not. You've got to read the puzzle. Everything you need\nis on the puzzle. Maria now closing in\non her puzzle. Holes in your plank? Confusion now. What is happening? PROBST:\nWe've never seen this before\nin a challenge. Liz now running back, appears to be\ngoing to help Kenzie. Got to go over the obstacles. Maria has her puzzle finished. Now she's working on it. Everything up in the air now. It's Kenzie trying\nto figure out the combination, Maria trying\nto figure out the combination. PROBST:\nThe puzzle contains information you need\nto finish this challenge. Maria now gonna head back out. Got to go over\nall the obstacles. Here comes Liz, coming back. She's carrying the plank. The only guess\nis she is helping Kenzie. Maria now moving\nthrough those rope rungs as fast as she can. Liz now here\nwith Kenzie's plank. Maria on her own,\ntrying to get her plank and get back here. They've got what they need.\nCan they figure it out? PROBST:\nNo! PROBST:\nSomething got to be wrong. Here comes Maria.\nShe's got her plank. Kenzie and Liz working together. Maria on her own. Immunity on the line. Thirty-five. PROBST:\nKenzie has it, bangs the gong. -It is over.\n-Yes! Oh, my God! -Yes!\n-With the help of Liz, -Yes, yes, yes!\n-Kenzie's won her second immunity challenge,\nguaranteed a spot -in the final four.\n-KENZIE: Oh, my God. You deserve it and more. PROBST:\nMaria just a little short. KENZIE:\nMaria. Good job. Wow.\nAnother unpredictable moment in an absolutely unpredictable season of Survivor. LIZ:\nYou're a badass. It takes two to beat you.\nYou're a badass, Maria. -KENZIE: Yeah,\nyou're incredible, Maria.\n-LIZ: Seriously. Kenzie, come on over. -Yeah.\n-For the second time\nthis season, -individual immunity is yours.\n-Dude. -You are guaranteed a spot\nin the final four.\n-Yeah. It means you will never\nbe voted out this season. -Yeah.\n-At the very least, -Kenzie!\n-Go, Kenzie!\n-you got a shot at making fire. Yeah, I can-I can taste it.\nYou know, I... (whoops) Thank you so much, Liz.\nLike, Maria, you're incredible. Like, we had to team up\nto beat you. Like, that just proves, like, what an amazing competitor\nyou are. It just made sense. When Liz saw she wasn't\ngonna finish her puzzle, it was just like,\n\"Okay, girl, we got to go.\" Maria, it is one of the most\ninteresting facets of Survivor-- is that the better you are, the bigger the target you are. I take it as a compliment,\nhonestly. Like, I have exceeded\nmy expectations out here, and if it took two people\nto beat me, then, like, it's a big compliment to me -and good for them\nfor teaming up.\n-It is a compliment. You know, it's not over\nuntil you snuff my torch. PROBST:\nAll right, so here's\nwhat's gonna happen. You're gonna leave here,\ngo to the sanctuary. -CHARLIE: Wow.\n-Yeah.\n-You're choosing one person. Who are you gonna take with you\nto the sanctuary? I'm torn because,\nLiz, you helped me, but Ben's the only one\nwho's never seen it. -Like, what...\n-I'd go with Ben. I'm allergic to pasta. -KENZIE: Oh, okay.\n-Are you serious? -Yeah.\n-Bennie boy. You haven't seen\nthe sanctuary yet. All right, so here's\nwhat's gonna happen. You two are gonna\nhead out to the sanctuary. -Okay.\n-You'll return back to camp\nin time for Tribal Council. -Grab your stuff, head out.\n-Do I get a hug? -Oh.\n-Buddy hug. I love buddy hugs.\n-Let's go. -Thanks, Jeff.\n-Congrats. Thank you. Down the steps, hang a right.\nBoat'll pick you up. -KENZIE: Thank you so much.\n-BEN: Thanks, Liz. -LIZ: Have fun.\n-KENZIE: Thanks. Let's go chill hard, buddy. -Let's go chill hard!\n-PROBST: All right, Maria, Charlie, Liz, got nothing\nfor you. Grab your stuff. Head back camp. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council where somebody will be the 14th person\nvoted out, seventh member of our jury. -See you tonight.\n-Jeff.\n-Thank you. LIZ: Yes, what I did\n was wild, but I'm trying\nto make it to the end. And honestly,\n that's all I care about. It seems like a no-brainer\n that tonight is Maria's night. But this is Survivor. This is the final five. Anything can happen. Well, it's been one of\nthe most unpredictable seasons of Survivor, and honestly, it's\nwhy I still love doing this job.

Dude. And it was, like,\nthe most important -and sickest\nimmunity of the season.\n-And the po... I didn't care\nwhich one of us won it as long as it wasn't Maria. -Damn right.\n-Oh. Cheers. My dude. -To chillin' mad hard.\n-To chillin' mad hard. Going into\n the immunity challenge today, there was one common goal,\nand it was for Maria to not win. And Liz helped me win immunity, which I was surprised at. She is so unpredictable.\n She's like a secret assassin. This is heaven. It's a perfect day, and\nI'm not getting voted out, ever. I'm here to stay, baby. Like, I'm going to final four\nwhether y'all like it or not. Honestly, today is,\nlike, amazing for me. -Like, winning...\n-Because the high\nis so high today. -Like...\n-I know, and, like,\nI get to be out here -with, like, my Survivor bestie.\n-Oh, my God, it's sick. (laughs) It was so sick Kenzie picked me\n for the reward today because in this game, you hope to make alliances,\nand then you make a real friend with a person like Kenzie. Like, how can you not feel grateful to shred\nin a situation like this? When I go home,\nI just have to catch up on all the things\nI ignored for years 'cause I was too busy\ntrying to rock my hardest. -Gonna get my driver's license.\n-Hell yeah. -That's a good place to start.\n-Yeah. If you want to be an adult, -we should get\na driver's license.\n-Exactly. On top of that,\n we're sitting in Fiji, overlooking one of the most\n epic landscapes of all time. It's such a vibe.\nIt's, like, electric, almost. What do we do when we get back?\nI don't want to come in cocky and be like,\n\"Oh, Maria tonight,\" you know? Feels, like, too perfect. I would be shocked\nif something crazy happened. BEN:\n I think we're all\n on the same page 'cause the enemy is so common. Maria is a whole-package threat. Multiple immunities,\ndecimated people's gameplay, played an epic game\n of deception. So, unless she finds an idol\n or pulls a blindside, Maria's done. MARIA:\nWell, that was a fun challenge. -It was fun, Maria.\n-CHARLIE: Oh, my God.\n-It was fun. -I do love you, dude.\n-I love you, too. You're just such\na friggin' competitor, dude. I love you, too.\nThank you for saying that. -I'm just really scared\nof going home.\n-Don't worry about it. -Don't worry about it.\n-I still really... -I'm still really scared.\n-You know what? -I'm so proud of myself. -CHARLIE: Liz going over to Kenzie to help\nto take down Maria-- that says, to me,\n Liz is here to play. MARIA:\nI'm gonna spend the afternoon\nlooking for idols. If I can find one,\nI'm gonna pretend -I don't have one.\n-CHARLIE: Yup. And then you and I take out\nwhoever we want to take out. I think, that's... I mean... After last Tribal Council, I made sure that my door\nto work with Maria was open. 'Cause I didn't know\n what today would bring. So, I want to solidify Maria as my champion\nif she's going home tonight, and as someone\nwho's gonna work with me if she finds an idol. -We just should just check\n-Mm-hmm. tree mail, water well,\nunderneath, -and then go the back way,\n-Yes. -and then go back down\nto the beach.\n-Okay. MARIA: It's really hard\n to come back to camp knowing that\nLiz just worked against me. I'm, like, super pissed. But at the same time,\n I'm like, \"Damn.\" Like, maybe it just takes\ntwo people to beat me. This is cool. This feels like\nit would be a good -\"tied to a branch\" tree.\n-Mm-hmm. MARIA: My plan from here\n is to find an idol or convince somebody to work with me. MARIA:\n I think Charlie has\n forgiven me and would work with me,\n but that's not enough. We need one more person. Let's go! Let's go! MARIA:\n So, today is definitely gonna\nbe an uphill climb in the snow, barefoot. I've just never been one\nto give up. Like, I just... It's not in me to give up. (chuckles) Hi. You coming\nto keep tabs on me? No, I was just looking\nto talk to you. Oh.\nHere's my pitch to you. You got to know\nthat, like, with Ben, I've distrusted him\nsince day one. -That's why\nwe're not working together.\n-Yeah. Like, the fact that\nhe's trying to convince you that he accidentally\nwrote \"Kenzie.\" -You wouldn't...\n-I've never believed -he accidentally wrote \"Kenzie.\"\n-But that's what I'm saying. You're about to move forward\nwith somebody who's so deceptive,\nand I'm telling you, -I'm an open book.\n-Yeah. I just don't think\nI can beat you. -I think I can beat Ben.\n-Yeah. KENZIE:\n Maria's selling\n Ben writing my name down a couple of days ago\n wasn't an accident. She is fighting for her life right now, which I respect,\n but she's almost making her argument worse\nby being so convincing. I'm like, \"No,\nyou're even more dangerous.\" Her pitching Ben is foolish. There's no way any of us\n are gonna fall for that. MARIA:\nI'm gonna put myself out there. -LIZ: Mm.\n-Big time, 'cause I got\nnothing to lose. -Yeah.\n-Ben wrote Kenzie's\nname down on purpose. -That was not an accident.\n-Hmm. And he lied to her face, and -he's been lying to her face.\n-LIZ: Wow. Ben's been playing a game\nthat nobody knows, and he's very charismatic. He is fully capable of pulling something out\nat Final Tribal. He could come out and say,\n\"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. \"None of you even knew -that I was doing this.\"\n-Yeah. What if he has this,\nlike, rocking story? I have no idea.\nThat's the scary part. MARIA:\nTaking Ben to the final three\nis dangerous. -Yeah.\n-MARIA: And I think the decision\nis in your hands, really. LIZ:\nWell, we would\nall have to do that. I know that this is crazy, but Maria really got to me\nabout Ben and the unknown. If he drops a bomb or two, it might be just enough\n for him to win the game. That's terrifying. I've been so focused\n on trying to get Maria out, but is that really\n what is best for Liz? Ben, Ben, Ben. CHARLIE:\n If you told me this morning Maria goes to Liz and pitches Ben\nas the vote out tonight, I would have\nlaughed you off of Fiji. But it seems like Liz is willing to do\nsomething different tonight. KENZIE:\nWe're all just\nvoting Maria, right? -Yeah.\n-Like, why does tonight\nfeel so heavy when it should be so easy? CHARLIE:\n Maria has a lot\n of enemies in this game. Ben, on the other hand,\n has friends on the jury. He's a great storyteller, he's charismatic, and we've been together since day one. So I'm worried the jury\nmight see us as similar players. He could easily get\n some of my jury votes, and that's dangerous. I don't know. MARIA:\n I am so scared because tonight could be the end for me. I've done all I can do, but if I can pull off this move, I'm gonna win this game. And so, tonight\n is a massive night. It's do-or-die for me. (V O) Fe ed in g a hi gh -q ua li ty d og f oo d doesn't have to cost a whole\nlot. For about a dollar a day, you can give your dog the BLUE\nBuffalo food they deserve.

And we came up with the idea of creating\na community S'mores table. The Hershey Company\ngot wind of this and sent 40,000 candy bars. Made my day a\nhundred times better. I love S'mores so much. ( \u266a \u266a ) I'm getting\nvaccinated with Pfizer's pneumococcal\npneumonia vaccine. So am I. Because I'm at risk\nfor pneumococcal pneumonia. Come on. I already got\na pneumonia vaccine, but I'm asking about the added\nprotection of Prevnar 20\u00ae. If you're 19 or older with\n certain chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease,\n or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal\n pneumonia. Prevnar 20\u00ae is\n approved in adults to help prevent infections from 20 strains\n of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal\n pneumonia. In just one dose. Don't get Prevnar 20\u00ae\n if you've had a severe allergic\n reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened\n immune systems may have a lower response\n to the vaccine. The most common\n side effects were pain and swelling at the injection\n site, muscle pain, fatigue,\n headache, and joint pain. I want to be able\nto keep my plans. I don't want to risk\nending up in the hospital with pneumococcal\npneumonia. That's why I chose\nPrevnar 20\u00ae. Ask your doctor or pharmacist\n about the Pfizer vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a All right.\nLet's just get right into it. Today was an interesting day\nat the challenge. Kenzie's in the lead.\nMaria's on her tail. And at that point, Liz decides,\n\"I'm gonna help Kenzie.\" And it worked.\nKenzie wins individual immunity. Congratulations. But, Maria,\nwhere does that sit, knowing that they were working together\nto make sure you didn't win? Honestly, I have\nno hard feelings at all. I think at 47 with three small kids at home and three immunity challenges\nunder my belt, I hold my head up high,\nand I feel super proud\nof the game that I played. PROBST:\nAnd I just want to say, there are a lot of people\nthat look at Survivor now and feel like\nit's a younger person's game, but then somebody\nlike you shows up and says, \"Oh, no, no. \"Oh, I still got game. I got a lot of game.\" And, Ben, the better you are, the bigger the target. That's just how\nthe game goes, you know? Maria's a great player. I still think\nshe is the MVP of the season. But no hard feelings. We all have to outlast, outplay, outwit, outshred,\nwhatever it is. The bottom line is\nwe have to play the game. PROBST:\nKenzie, what Ben\nis saying is that you do develop relationships, and sometimes\nthey become like this, but then sometimes they do this. Doesn't mean you can't\nplay the game with somebody, but it does mean\nif I have the opportunity to take you out, I might. And it sounds like Ben\nis saying, \"I have no problem writing\nMaria's name down tonight.\" -Am I getting this right?\n-Yeah, definitely. KENZIE:\nYeah. Maria's incredible. Like, an amazing woman. -Thank you.\n-KENZIE: I admire you.\nI respect you. I love you deeply. And that is what's\ncrazy about Survivor, is that I can look someone\nin the face and be like, \"You could kick my ass\nup and down this game.\" So I have to write\nyour name down tonight. -I totally understand.\n-KENZIE: Because... ...you would beat all of us. You're amazing. -You are wonderful.\n-Thank you, Kenzie. -I love you.\n-I love you, too. Liz, Ben and Kenzie\nhave been very open. They're voting Maria.\nSo, where are you? I'm just ready\nto focus on the game. Sometimes I'm like\na horse with blinders on. When I was helping Kenzie\nwith the puzzle today, I wasn't thinking\nabout Maria's feelings. Afterwards, I was definitely\nthinking about her feelings and what a jerk I looked like. And so it's really hard, but Maria and I, we're like two ships passing in the night.\nLike, we could have been the, like,\nmost dynamic duo out here, but for some reason, instead\nof attracting each other, we just kept getting further and\nfurther apart with each vote. Charlie, where are you\nwith Maria? Yeah, so... Maria and I have worked really side by side\na lot of this game. We've got 24 days together. You know,\nyou have people that you build these insane bonds with, and then you have to\nvote each other out. Tonight, it's almost like\na sibling rivalry moment. PROBST:\nMaria, from my vantage point,\nyou've been very gracious about handling this pressure\nand having a target and even having them\ndouble-team, trying to get at you. How are you able\nto play the game as hard as you've played\nbut also understand, \"You're coming for me. If you can get me,\nyou should get me.\" Um, I think any competitor knows how to win\nand knows how to lose. And I can honor and respect any move that takes down\na fierce competitor like myself. There's also the knowledge that\nmy kids are watching. My kids are watching tonight. You know? And I plan\non walking out of here with my head held high. (sniffles) I'm proud of myself,\nI'm proud of my game, and I know that they're\ngonna be proud of me. And being ungracious-- like, that's not\nwhat I want them to do. And so I'm going to be\nan example to them. PROBST:\nWhere does that come from? I guess it comes\nfrom my upbringing. You know, I'm-I'm an immigrant. I come from Beirut, Lebanon, and you know, I grew up with, I guess,\nan environment of survival. You know, work hard,\nbe determined and to be honest\nand to be respectful and to be gracious\nand to be humble. And I think to myself, \"My husband and I\nare raising three boys, \"and Daddy is strong as hell. But you know what?\nMommy is, too.\" PROBST:\nWell, it's a tough\ntransition to make, but it is time to vote. Maria, you're up. \u266a \u266a I literally want\nto be you when I grow up. You're the coolest person\nin the whole world, which is exactly\nwhy this is happening, because you literally would\n have wiped the floor with us. Like, you're amazing. \u266a \u266a Listen up, future nephews. Your mom kicks butt. \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. \u266a \u266a If anybody has an advantage or\nan idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right.\nI'll read the votes. First vote: Ben. Let's go! (laughing) Maria. One vote Ben, one vote Maria. Maria. Two votes Maria,\none vote Ben. Fourteenth person voted out and the seventh member\nof our jury: Maria. That's three. That's enough.\nNeed to bring me your torch. Good job, Maria. Bring it in, Lieutenant Mom. LIZ:\nI want a hug. Thank you. \u266a \u266a Maria, the tribe has spoken. Thank you. It's been a pleasure, you guys.\nLove you. -We love you, Maria. (whooping)\n-MVP. -(Liz whoops)\n-Bye. \u266a \u266a (mouths) Congratulations on\nmaking it to the final four. Tomorrow, you'll compete in\nyour final immunity challenge. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night. Oh, wow. You know what? I feel amazing. I played such a good game. I'm 47 and, you know,\n I smoked some of these guys. It felt really good\n to know that, at my age, at my stage of life,\nlike, I still got it. Me mo ri al D ay S av in gs st ar t no w at T he H om e De po t. So make a space\nto soak in the season.

(all whooping) CHARLIE: Come here, Meemaw. -Let's go!\n-(whooping) LIZ:\n Holy hot dog on a stick,\n I made it. Ta-frigging-da, baby. Final four feels amazing.\n But honestly, I knew it was gonna happen. BEN: Congrats to y'all. LIZ: It was. CHARLIE:\n As sweet as it is\n being in the final four, Tribal was hard. I knew if I was going to have a shot at this title,\nMaria couldn't be there with me. LIZ: Oh, my God. -Yeah, that's a lot of power.\n-LIZ: It's a lot of power. CHARLIE:\n This whole game,\n I've been all about options, and, tomorrow,\n the only way to have options is to win. You have\nto be wearing the necklace. Otherwise you're at the mercy of whoever is wearing it. \u266a \u266a BEN:\n(panting rapidly) Aah! BEN: At night,\n I don't know what happens. Some nights, I have\n a reason why I freak out, but last night, I had all the\nreason in the world to chill-- you know, I had a reward, we got Maria out. But I have this hysteria, and I have to calm down\nfor a minute. It takes a while. BEN: It's weird.\nIt's like I wake up from a dream and this jolt of electricity bumps me up like Beetlejuice. -I've been suffering since,\nlike, day 13 or whatever.\n-I know. (panting) -KENZIE: Ben, is that you?\n-Yeah. -Hold my hand just a little bit.\n-KENZIE: I'm right here. Ah. Yeah. I need water. I feel like I don't\nstand a chance, you know? I thought I went into this game really having conquered\n some of my demons, but... the big lesson\nfor me in life is how do you let go of trying to control\nwhat you can't? And how do you trust in yourself and believe in who you are\n despite your fears? Yeah. But at the same time, I feel very blessed because people show up for me. They believe in me. Anti-anxiety hug. We got you, bro. BEN:\n To me, it just\n comes down to, like, I went through it. I didn't quit. And thank God\nI had Kenzie and Charlie. \u266a \u266a \u266a Tree mail, tree mail \u266a \u266a Where do you get your news \u266a BOTH:\n\u266a Tree mail, tree mail \u266a \u266a Gathering all the clues \u266a \u266a Yow! \u266a -CHARLIE: This is intense.\n-BEN: I know. Siga! (both exclaim) Let's go. -Dude.\n-Dude. The last two Siga. The first pair remaining. -Dumb and Dumber, baby.\n-Let go! CHARLIE:\n I've been with Ben\n since day one. You know, we started\n the Dumb and Dumber alliance after we botched\n the Savvy challenge. We've become more than friends. Friends doesn't cut it anymore. -You want to read it?\n-I'll read it. Sure. -Dude, these beads\nare sick, too.\n-These are sick. Thank you. CHARLIE:\n Problem is, you know, this is the pinnacle\n of the Survivor dilemma. We're friends,\nbut we're friends going to war. -Ooh...\n-Ooh... -Last immunity challenge.\n-Let's go! KENZIE:\nFinal four. I mean, I'm in. (laughing) The final four challenge\nis the most important challenge of the entire game. Especially for me,\nbecause I'm so nervous about fire-making. I have this\n really weird condition where the ligaments on my wrist are too big for my body. And so my joints are constantly\npopping in and out of place. (popping) So I haven't been\n practicing fire very much because my hand\n starts cramping up and I don't want to look like\n a complete dum-dum. Ugh! There we go. There you go, Benny. Nice job. LIZ:\n I'm getting this feeling\n that everyone thinks Liz is the number one threat. We definitely need to throw her into fire. I've never had\n my name written down. I have four Nami members on the jury. And so if I make it\n to the final three, I can literally\n see Jeff with the parchment. \"The winner is Liz.\" (whoops) I hope I win this immunity. Otherwise, I got to make fire.\n I just know it. Yo u kn ow w ha t I wa nt ? Grapes...that taste like\ncotton candy. Yeah, join the club. How about a fancy\nsteakhouse ribeye?

Liz, I hope there's a story to the cane on day 25. You know, just bringing Meemaw to the challenge. No, wait. There's been\nso many jokes this season. Is this a joke\nor are you really injured? -It's a joke.\n-(laughing) 25 days.\nThis is what'll happen to you. 25 days?\nThis was day one, dude. (laughs) All right. Shall we get to\nyour final immunity challenge? -Oh, yeah.\n-First things first, Kenzie. -I go to take it back\nfor the second time.\n-Do it. Here you go. Ooh. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, all you have to do is solve a simple Survivor logo puzzle. -Yeah, right.\n-Catch?\n-(laughs) -But there's a catch.\n-Yeah. PROBST:\n You're gonna have a timer\n in the form of a giant Survivor pinball table.\n Here's how it works. You're gonna start by rolling\n your ball up an inclined ramp. While the ball is making\n its way back down the ramp, you can work on your puzzle. When the ball\n reaches the bottom, you got to stop, grab your ball, roll it again. But if you fail to get your ball\nbefore it hits the metal track, then you have to wait as the ball slowly makes its way to the bottom. And during that time,\n you can't work on your puzzle. So during this entire challenge,\nyour focus is going to be split, making it very difficult\n to concentrate. But you're still in.\nYou're not out. You're still in. -Yeah, that's sick.\n-Just whoever -completes it first.\n-You're just slow.\n-Yeah. -Yeah.\n-BEN: Hey, I have... Jeff, I want to say\nsomething real quick. I barely slept\nmore than two hours a night -for, like, 14 days.\n-PROBST: Wow. And it's, like, been the most intense time\nof my entire life. And, uh, I don't know,\nI'm just ready to rock, dude. That's it. Shall we finish with the stakes? -Yeah, let's do it.\n-Oh, yeah.\n-Yeah. -That's important.\n-First person to finish wins immunity, guarantees themselves a spot at the final three. Let it sink in. Where you get a chance\nto plead your case to the jury about\nwhy you deserve the title of Sole Survivor and the million\ndollars that goes along with it. Plus, you have enormous power, because you decide who you put\nnext to you in that second spot and who you force to make fire\nto earn that third spot. Biggest challenge of the season. -We'll draw her spots.\n-(whoops) -PROBST: Get it on. Here we go.\n-Let's go, Jeff Probst.\n-(exclaims) \u266a \u266a All right, here we go. For immunity\nand a guaranteed spot at three. Survivors ready? Go! Last challenge of the season. You've got to roll that ball then work on your puzzle\nas it makes its way down. Liz didn't get hers up.\nYou got to try it again. That'll do it, Liz.\nGet to work on that puzzle. So you're working on the puzzle while trying to listen and\nanticipate where your ball is. You don't want it\nto hit that metal frame. Then you get a big penalty. Kenzie heading back. Charlie\nheading back. Ben heading back. Kenzie with another roll. She's good. Charlie's good. Ben has his ball. Ben's good. Liz, nice left-handed launch.\nThat'll work. Everybody back on the puzzle. You know this logo. You've been\nliving with it on your Buff. But the puzzle is the easy part. Charlie, stop. Put the piece\ndown. Go to your board. Charlie's ball\ncame down very quickly. He missed it.\nNow, he's got to wait a very long time, as that ball slowly rolls to the bottom. Giving an advantage\nto everybody else. Day 25, Survivor 46. Your shot at a million dollars,\nright here. \u266a \u266a Charlie still waiting\nwhile everybody else is working. Kenzie doing\na nice job on her puzzle. Ben making some progress. Liz with a piece. Every single second\nis gonna matter. \u266a \u266a Charlie's ball\nstill on the track. Painful anticipation. Charlie with a nice toss. He's back on his puzzle. It is Kenzie in the lead. Then Ben, then Charlie and Liz. Immunity on the line. You win this, you got a shot.\nYou get to plead your case. If not, your fate\nis in somebody else's hands. Oh, and Liz drops her ball\nin the track. Now, she has to wait. Human error, unforced error. Liz now waiting. Kenzie trying\nto find another piece. Charlie trying\nto get back in this. Ben being very conservative now. Heading back,\nnot taking any chances. Liz waiting. Kenzie\ntrying to take advantage of it. KENZIE:\nWhoops. Kenzie loses her ball.\nNow got to track it down. Now it's Kenzie\nwho gave up a time advantage. It is Ben and Charlie\nin the lead. Here goes Kenzie. That's gonna be short,\ncosting her time. (Kenzie groans) Kenzie with another bad toss. (Kenzie grunts) PROBST:\nKenzie suffering\nfrom bad tosses. It is Ben and Charlie\nside by side, then Kenzie. Something so simple,\nlike rolling a ball, could cost you\na million dollars. Charlie races back\nand saves it by an inch. Charlie back to work\non his puzzle. Kenzie with another\npiece on her puzzle. Kenzie races back,\nsaves her ball. She's got it. Kenzie's\nquickly getting back in this. It's now Ben in the lead. He's yet\nto win an immunity challenge. This would be his first. He's put everything on a slow and steady approach. Kenzie, right behind, fresh\non the heels of an immunity win. Would love it again. Charlie trying to catch up. Charlie, once again, risks too much. That ball clanks.\nHe's got to wait. It is Kenzie and Ben\nright now very close. Charlie has had two setbacks. That ball has clanked twice. This is gonna\nbe close at the end. We are neck and neck right now. Ben with another piece. Charlie's back in it now. Liz in dead last. (Liz shouts) The sound of that clank is death in this challenge. It is a showdown between Ben and Kenzie. Kenzie trying to find another\npiece. She's got to race back. Kenzie's got to get it here. One good toss. She's got it!\nKenzie down to three pieces. Ben down to two pieces. Ben very close to winning\nhis first immunity challenge. Charlie with another piece. You cannot slow down right now. Kenzie very close. Ben down to his last piece. For the win. Ben has done it! It's over! Ben wins individual immunity. Guaranteed a spot\nin the final three of Survivor 46. All right! Came down to three pieces between Kenzie and Ben. You say everybody wants some.\nHow 'bout you? (laughs) PROBST:\nBen, come on over. -CHARLIE: Let's go, buddy.\n-KENZIE: Let's go, Katzman. (whoops) Dude, I thought\nI'd never get to see the day. -Rock and roll.\n-You look great, bud. Ben, your first individual\nwin of the season couldn't come at a better time.\nYou have done it. You've guaranteed yourself\na spot at the final three. You will get\na chance to plead your case to a jury of people\nyou've helped vote out about why you deserve\nthe title of Sole Survivor and the million dollars\nthat goes along with it. You also have\na lot of power tonight. You're gonna decide\nwhich of these three-- Liz, Charlie or Kenzie-- you say,\n\"I want you next to me,\" and which of the other two\nare gonna have to make fire to earn that third spot. Yeah, it's, uh...\na little wild. I found it remarkable, given\nthat just a few minutes ago, you walked in here saying,\n\"I'm so distracted. -I can't focus.\"\n-Yeah. And you get a challenge\nthat requires split focus. And of all four,\nyou had the most focus. It was clear.\nWhere did that come from? What is that inside you\nthat you, when you need to,\nyou can get that gear? Today, I was just like,\n\"I have to show up for me,\" 'cause I'm always trying\nto be somebody's hype man. And at, like,\n1:00 in the morning, I'm like, \"It's okay, dude. I love you.\nYou came this far.\" And when I got here,\nand I was like, \"Wow. It's like a pachinko machine\nor something.\" -It brought out,\nlike, the little kid in me.\n-Mm. And I live to be my inner child. That's why I'm in a rock band. You know what I'm saying? And this was, like, the most meditational, transcendental\nshred-itation game of the entire season. So I just was in the moment, and I didn't\nthink about anything else. -All right.\n-I know that's a word scramble, -but that's how my brain is.\n-It was beautiful. No, it was beautiful. You found meditation\nwhere everybody else saw chaos. -BEN: Yeah.\n-PROBST: All right. You are safe.\nYou're in the final three. -Crazy.\n-Busy afternoon,\nI'm imagining, back at camp, as Liz, Charlie and Kenzie\nwill all be making different cases for different reasons.\nGrab your stuff. Head out. I'll see you all tonight\nat Tribal Council. -Can I give you a hug, though?\n-Give me a hug, brother. -OTHERS: Aw...\n-All right! -PROBST: Congrats. Well done.\n-BEN: Thanks, Jeff. -See you tonight at Tribal.\n-(exhales) -LIZ: Good job, brother.\n-BEN: Let's do it. I was so down on myself, and I could have quit\nwhen I was at my lowest, but I didn't. And for some reason, the determination just came out and then I won immunity. It's so sick. 13-year-old me,\nwho got made fun of for everything and\ntold I wouldn't get anywhere. Who's gonna be able\n to tell me what now, dude?

Long lasting EYLEA HD could significantly improve your vision and can help you go up to 4 months between treatments. If you have an eye infection,\n eye pain or redness, or allergies to\n EYLEA HD, don't use. Eye injections like EYLA HD\n may cause eye infection, separation of the\nretina, or rare but severe swelling\n of blood vessels in the eye. An increase in eye pressure\n has been seen. There's an uncommon risk\n of heart attack or stroke associated\n with blood clots. The most common side effects\n were blurred vision, cataract, corneal injury,\n and eye floaters. And there's still\n so much to see. If you are on EYLEA or a similar type\n of treatment, ask your retina specialist\n about EYLEA HD today, for the potential\n for fewer injections.

BEN:\nWell, listen, I know\nwe all want to get into it, but I'm gonna be honest,\nlike, I don't have... -No, no. We want to rest, dude.\n-Okay. Okay. Yeah, you can collect your\nthoughts. Do whatever you need. This is what I think about\nthe other two. No, I'm kidding. I'm so proud of myself. Nobody would call me\n a challenge beast. I was the kid\nthey didn't pick for dodgeball.

(whoops) Wearing this necklace,\n as a Survivor fan, it's just like,\n \"Damn, I did it.\" To hear Jeff just say, \"Ben's got it!\"--\nlike, that's crazy. You know?\n After all my panic attacks and all my fears, it's just a confirmation. When in doubt, if you rock out, it's all gonna work out. And then\n the weight of winning hit me. I'm in the final three,\n and this necklace allows me to pick who's gonna sit next to me and who's gonna\n go at it in fire. I have to think, \"Who can\n I beat at this final three?\" So I feel like, no matter what,\n it's a difficult thing. And some people\nneed the money more than others. Some people\nare in different situations. So, Ben, what you thinking? Yeah, I mean, obviously,\nI'm very close with Kenzie, and Charlie's,\nlike, my day one. And, uh... I think you kind of\nunintentionally played the hardest game out here. -I mean, I'm super flattered.\n-Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's why I'm gonna ask you\nto do fire tonight. I don't think I could beat you. Yo, you outlasted\nthe whole Nami tribe. -You know what I'm saying?\n-Mm-hmm. -You went without eating.\n-I mean, I know Nami's on there,\nbut I betrayed all of them. I mean, that's another thing. Everybody on that jury\nalready knows, like, I... -I'm a millionaire.\nLike, I don't need the money.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, I need it. I think\nI'm the most broke person of the four that are here,\nyou know? She was like, \"I got money.\nI just want to make it further.\" I'm broke, you know? Like, I share a space\n with my parents. So, to me,\n it just confirmed that I don't want her\n in the final three. Yeah, well, I'm out.\nI'm last jury. I suck at fire. I can barely hold a knife. -(wrists popping)\n-Yeah. And on top of that, Liz\nhas the most homies on the jury. She's the last person on Nami because people didn't think she\nwas a threat. Now, she's here. Can I give you a hug? -Sure.\n-If you don't want one,\nI get it. So, now the thing\n I got to think about is who I'm gonna\nput up against Liz. Always down to rip it up.\nI'm here, okay? Okay. \u266a \u266a (sniffles) (spits) They're onto me,\n and I'm pissed. Ben just told me, \"Liz, you've been playing\nthe hardest game.\" Like, that I'm gonna win, that I'm the winner.\n (laughs) I knew the fire-making was the hole in the plan. My friggin' loose-ass wrists can't hold things for nothing. But I'm not...\n I'm not gonna give up. I guess I need to practice fire. It's like,\nI'm having a hard time... -...picking between you and him.\n-I know. Charlie's my day one. But it's like,\nyou are also equally as important to me in this game. So then it just comes down\nto who can beat Liz. -Yeah.\n-And who you want -to have that on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n-I know. -Ooh!\n-It's okay. -I'm good with\nwhatever choice you make.\n-Yeah. I'm gonna practice all day. This season,\n my fire-making's been great. So, tonight, would I like\nan opportunity to build fire? Yes. (exhales) Okay. Positives going\n into fire against Liz is I think I can beat her.\n Another positive is that it would be great for my r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\n but it doesn't make it any less\nanxiety-inducing. Like, I'm still freaking out, even if I have to do it. But for all I know,\n Ben could be like, \"Yeah, I'm gonna\n make Charlie do it.\" And then I'm freaking out\n for nothing. (laughs) (groans) \u266a \u266a Coming to check in on my boy. What's up, my man? Are you okay? Yeah.\nYou want to have a chat? Yeah.\nWhat's going on, dude? All's good.\nIt's a heavy decision. Yeah. What's... Talk me\nthrough it. W-What's going on? You sit.\nPop a squat. BEN:\nIt's like, I know\nI want to put Liz in. CHARLIE:\nYeah. And it's like, I don't know whether to pick\nbetween you and Kenzie. Is Kenzie practicing? She's practicing. -Isn't she good?\n-Truth is, you're kicking the most ass at fire. You're seeing one right here, -but I've been\nkind of struggling, too.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\n Yeah, the competitor in me\n is like, \"Well, maybe I could beat Liz.\" But the other part of me\n just says, \"I don't think I need\nfire-making on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I don't really\nwant it on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\" And it makes me\n want to just say, \"Look, Ben,\n just take me with you.\" You know, take the easy way\n to the final three. At the end of the day, would...\nif I asked you, if I was like, \"Will you\ntake me?\" would you take me? -I haven't made that decision.\n-Right. And I know it's hard. 'Cause I know you're\nreally close with Kenz, but listen,\nshe can probably beat Liz. I need to get in front of the jury. Forget about the fire. -No, I...\n-Then, 'cause, you know, then\nthat's all in your hands, but... Yeah, I'm not doing that. CHARLIE:\n Ben has all the power today. His goal is to have Liz out of the game. I'm solid at fire, but, you know, fire is fluky, and I'm sure Liz is no slouch. All it takes\nis one lucky strike. \u266a \u266a Fudge. (groans) I feel like\nI know how to do this, but then\nI don't know how to do it. Ben was like, \"Oh, my gosh. \"There's absolutely no way I can beat you at the end,\" which is obvious. It's gonna be over for them. (groans) Wow, I'm on\na roller coaster of emotion. You can do it, 'cause you are the winner. I will not be beaten. (groans) CHARLIE:\nIs that Liz yelling? She just, like,\nliterally screamed. Okay, I'm feeling better. I need flame. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. Just make a couple jokes,\nand you'll get it, Liz. Yay. \u266a \u266a KENZIE:\n I'm feeling scared. Yeah, I-I know...\nI-I know I can make fire. I've done it\na hundred times, but... there's something about,\n like, cracking under pressure. I can't get anything\n to catch on fire, and, like... Ugh. I just\n need to get it together. Oh, my gosh, I'm doing it... KENZIE:\n This is, like,\n the pressure point, but... any challenge there is,\nI'm gonna face it head-on. And I'm gonna give it my all,\n even though I'm scared. I know I can do this.\nI can do this. CHARLIE:\n This is it. After tonight,\nthe final three is set. The weight of that pressure--\n it's suffocating. Oh, yes, baby. Did you make your choice? BEN:\n I'm trying to figure out\n who I think has a better chance at beating Liz. That's what I'm talking about. Dude, you crushed it. Charlie's really good at fire, but the hardest part is Charlie's been my number one\nfrom day one. I love the kid. And the other side is Kenzie. She's been one of the best\n friends I made out here, and she's been my number one\n through my panic attacks. She's been a sweetheart. There you go, Kenzie. I don't know how I'm gonna lean one over the other. I have to think wisely. It's heavy, bro.\n I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. \u266a \u266a Fo r yo ur o wn s af et y, y ou 'l l al l be a ss um in g ne w id en ti ti es . Hello! I'm your new neighbor.

CHARLIE:\nJeff. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAll right. We get to our final\nimmunity challenge. On the surface,\nit's very simple. Just solve the Survivor logo puzzle in front of you. But there was a twist.\nBen, you were the only person\nthat didn't make any mistakes\nin the challenge. Explain that, because\nyou walked in and said, \"I am all over the place today,\" and yet something\ncrystallized, and you were perfect in that challenge. BEN:\nYou know, I didn't\ngo into that challenge expecting to win. I said that 'cause it was true.\nI haven't been able to sleep. Night terrors, panic attacks. It's just very, very brutal. For some reason, today,\nI just decided to say, \"This is it.\nI'm just gonna go for it.\" I don't know. I had a blast.\nIt just came together. PROBST:\nCharlie, you were\nin it for a while, but a couple of mistakes\ncost you this challenge. What did you reflect on\nthis afternoon? Today's immunity challenge\nis potentially the one with the most power\nof the season. Ben's, of course, safe tonight, but tonight he can do\nwhatever the heck he wants. So... it was a lot of reflecting, but there's not much\ntime for reflection when all I was really doing was making fires all day. Kenzie, you were very close. Would have been your third\nindividual immunity win. You, too, had issues,\nnot with getting the ball late, but with just\ngetting the ball up the ramp, and those few extra tosses\nwere the difference. You were a few pieces behind. Yeah, I was three pieces behind. And they will probably\nhaunt me forever. Like, crumbles. I'm happy\nfor my friend, but here we are. Liz, what was\nyour experience today? \"Liz, you're the biggest threat. \"You're definitely\ngoing to fire. I don't know\nwho's going against you.\" -Yeah.\n-LIZ: And then I just fell apart,\n'cause I suck at fire. And, um, I knew this was the one hole in my game. And I'm gonna go to fire.\nI mean, he's totally right. I've never\nhad my name written down, so, he's smarter than he looks. -(chuckles)\n-So, Ben, you had\none easy decision. -You knew Liz, immediately.\n-Yeah. So then the debate became Kenzie or Charlie. Yeah. And when it came down to\nKenzie and Charlie, I mean, Charlie's the first friend\nI made out here. I know that's not great\nwhen it comes to talking about your strategy, but if somebody can give you\na little bit of kindness, it goes a long way, whether\nthey know it or not. And the hard part is\nmy friendship with Kenzie is very similar, except\nI only met Kenzie at the merge. But I'd say her impact\non me feeling sane-- it's like, I can't...\nI can't oversell it. Like, I'm playing Survivor, but I'm hanging out with\nmy homies and having, like, a real human experience\nthat, like, you know, it sucks that I have to make this decision. PROBST:\nSo, Ben, are you ready\nto tell us your decision? So, it's gonna\nbe Liz and Kenzie tonight going at it for fire. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nWhich means, Charlie, you made it to the final three. You will take that second spot. This is what you dream of, because\ngetting to the final three is as much as any player can do. You've gone as far as\nyou can go. What's the feeling? CHARLIE:\nI'm grateful to Ben,\nyou know, in this moment. Because of the relationship\nand the bond that we've built, he's gonna take me\nto the final three. And getting there with that bond means just as much to me\nas making fire. PROBST:\nKenzie, what's it like\nto hear that when you can hear a little bit\nof emotion in Ben's voice, and he's very clearly saying, \"It wasn't easy for me because of love and friendship\"? KENZIE:\nYeah. There is emotion. Like, we have, like,\nfallen in love with each other, and it's so complicated. But at the same time, as annoyed as I am\nthat I have to do this, I am grateful that I'm not\ngetting my name written down and that I get a chance to try, you know?\nThat's exciting. (laughs) We're gonna\ngive it our all, baby. It's down to the ladies tonight. (chuckles)\nLike, it is what it is. All right, it is time for the final four\nfire-making challenge. The winner will take the third\nand final spot at our final Tribal Council.\nKenzie, Liz... take your spots. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a Sandals Jamaica Sale\nis now on!

Don't put up with\n wireless Yada Yada, now with Metro get that new customer\n feeling again and again, introducing Metro Flex, free 5g phones when you join, same deals as new customers when you stay. Only at Metro. All right. So, you both\nhave the same fire-making kit. In seasons past,\nwe have sent this kit out to your camp\nso you could practice. We did not do that this season.\nThis is new to you. All you had\nwas a knife and a flint. So, forget about\nsetting a record. This is about being faster\nthan the other person. Who can make fire fastest and get it to burn hot enough, long enough\nto burn through that rope? That's what\nwe're gonna find out. The person who does that\nwill make it to the final three. Are you both ready? -Ugh. No.\n-(chuckles) This is as good as it's gonna\nget, Jeff. (chuckles) -Liz?\n-Okay. All right.\nThis challenge is on. Begin. Takes three things to make fire. You need heat. You're gonna get that heat\nby striking your flint, trying to get a spark,\nsome friction. Then you need fuel. That's gonna\nbe kindling or some hessian. And then once you get a flame,\nyou need oxygen. You got to let it breathe,\nso it can get big enough to burn through that rope. Okay. Liz going for a spark. Liz has a baby flame. Fudge. No fire yet. Kenzie, a lot of prep.\nUnusual approach. Oh, my God. PROBST:\nLiz, a lot of spark. And a little bit of a flame. Aw... It dies. 25 days of fatigue\nand the pressure. This could literally be a million-dollar fire\nyou are making right now. Oh. What is happening? It's pressure. Keep digging. You're both in it, clearly. Okay. -Oh, my...\n-Kenzie. PROBST:\nKenzie's got\na little bit of a flame. Now she's got to nurture it. It's got to breathe.\nDon't want to suffocate it. Now Liz has\na little bit of a flame. And out. Kenzie still working. So long as\nshe doesn't smother it. Ow. PROBST: Kenzie continues\nto nurture that fire. Oh, God. PROBST: Liz now has flame.\nCan she get this one to stick? No. (groans) PROBST:\nKenzie's fire starting\nto take now. Medium-sized fire. Now it's starting to just light the fibers of that rope. It's really going now. That's burning that rope. -Oh, my God.\n-PROBST: That is a fire that's gonna get you a spot\nin the final three. -And there it is.\nKenzie's done it.\n-Oh, my God! PROBST:\nShe has earned the final spot -at the final three...\n-Oh... -Come on, you knew\nyou were winning that.\n-Oh... PROBST:\n...with Ben and Charlie and a\nshot at the million-dollar prize that goes along with it. Thanks, babe. Yeah. Of course. \u266a \u266a Boo. Tomato, tomato. PROBST:\nKenzie, let's start with you.\nCongratulations. Thank you so much. -PROBST: You've\nmade the final three,\n-Amazing. -Thank you.\n-you earned your way in. What is the feeling right now?\nI know it's been -an emotional 25 days.\n-(Kenzie exhales) Yeah, I mean, I... I've been\nat the bottom since Yanu, and I've been earning it\nthe whole way, so it just made sense. And it's so ironic\nthat we set the record for the longest time\nwithout flint, and... Earlier today, when I couldn't\ncatch a fire, I was like, \"Of course my journey's\ngonna end without fire. It started without fire.\" But I redeemed myself\nwith that today. It's just really overwhelming. Like, my... I couldn't\nget a flame all day today. So my confidence was shot.\nI was like, \"Well, you know...\" I'm just very grateful.\nI earned it. Liz, I know you've had\nsome very fun times and you've had\nsome very low lows. What's the big takeaway\nfrom this journey? You learn\nso much about yourself, and the game is so much bigger than you think it is. (sniffles) But I am very proud of my game. It was really over for you guys.\nIt really was. (sniffles) I would've beat all of you. (sniffles) All right, Liz. You become the eighth\nand final member -of our jury.\n-I know it. You need to grab your torch. \u266a \u266a (sniffles) Love you, Liz. I'll love you tomorrow. -(laughs): Take your time, mama.\n-LIZ: No, I love you now. Oh, God bless America. -Liz, the tribe has spoken.\n-(groans softly) Time for you to go. (sniffles) \u266a \u266a Kenzie, Ben, Charlie,\ncongratulations. You made it to the final three. Now, the power in the game\nshifts to the jury. They decide who wins. Tomorrow night,\nyou will face them and each of you will\nhave a chance to persuade them that it's you that deserves\nthe title of Sole Survivor and the million dollars that\ngoes along with it. You have one more night here\nin beautiful Fiji. Enjoy it. Try to get some sleep.\nYou know you're gonna need it. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. -I'll try, okay?\n-Good night. \u266a \u266a So close. So pissed. (laughs) I made it 25 days. I did everything\n I thought that I would do.

CHARLIE:\nI will not forget these. KENZIE:\nThe sunrises? No. Me either. -Be pretty hard.\n-Yeah. CHARLIE:\nHere comes the sun. -BEN: All right!\n-(cheering) CHARLIE: I've been out here\n for 26 days, and listening to everyone's stories,\ntheir accomplishments, their struggles, their dreams has changed my perspective\n on the world. That's been priceless. I don't think anybody\nwould have picked this as the final three. BEN:\nI couldn't have done it\nwithout you two. KENZIE:\nThanks, Ben. CHARLIE:\n I think every single one of us in this final three\ncould win the game. So, it's intense, it's exciting, but it's also really,\n really scary because tonight the jury\nhas all the power. TEVIN:\n Being on the jury is one\n of the most powerful things in the game. Tonight, we decide\n the Sole Survivor who deserves\nto win the million dollar prize. What did you do? How did you utilize us or not utilize us\nto get past us? -Wow!\n-Oh, my God! BEN: The best part\n about the final three morning is the feast. -Cheers to the final three...\n-BEN: Final three... -KENZIE: To final three.\n-of Survivor -forty-six!\n-forty-six! (whooping) CHARLIE:\nOh, my God, it's so good. Guys, we're eating\nlike humans again. I'm chilling hard today,\n but tonight, I have to give the performance\nof a lifetime. My game was a game of honesty built around being myself and relying on my social cards. Everybody called me\n a vibe person. Tonight is about showing that a vibe or chillin' isn't\nabout being one-dimensional. It's not me using it\n as a gimmick. It's about showing\n I played a hard game from day one. Q:\n Ben outwitted, outlast, outplayed us. The game he played\n was to rock out and fly underneath the radar. If he can articulate\n that he was behind moves, he could receive Q's vote. SODA:\n Ben shreds, Ben rips, Ben rocks. That's who Ben is. He's a social threat\n playing an emotional game that really worked for him,\n but it's \"outwit, outplay, outlast,\"\nnot \"outlove.\" My game has been about adapting\n and knowing when to sit back and when to step up. I had a fake idol play. I was a huge part in taking out the biggest threats in the game, and I beat Liz in fire-making. My biggest challenge tonight\n with the jury is that I've written a lot\nof their names down. I don't think\nanybody's holding back tonight. I know I'm not. Like, guns are blazing. I know my story's better\n than Charlie and Ben's. It's just about how I sell it. VENUS: Kenzie's social game\n was brilliant. I don't think there's a single\nperson who disliked her or didn't get along with her,\n but I want to hear from her specifically\n what moves she made. You have to have played the game to earn my vote. TIFFANY:\n Kenzie is somebody\n who cares about people, and I do believe that that's why\nshe lasted so long in the game. Friendship aside,\n gameplay at the forefront, I deeply feel that she's\nthe best candidate right now. CHARLIE:\nI had power in the game\nto send home who I thought... I had power in the game\nto send home... or to work with who I thought\nwas going to be able to carry me forward\nanother vote. I played a very strategic game worthy of the title\n of Sole Survivor. I built alliances, constantly. I never closed a door to anyone. I've always made sure that I put myself in a position\nwhere I was safe, but I also had power. But a lot of what I did\n was in the shadows. Tonight, I want to pull back the curtain on what I've done. The biggest hurdle\n is what the heck is the jury thinking of me? HUNTER:\n Charlie has done a good job of having his finger\n on the pulse. And he's also been winning\n immunity challenges, and so, he has, potentially,\n a story to tell that is worth a million dollars. MARIA: Charlie and I worked\n together so long that I'm pretty sure\n I know all of his moves, except when it came\nto him trying to take me out. But my criteria\n is not friendship. I want to make sure that\nthe person I write down tonight deserves this money. KENZIE:\nIs there anything\non your Survivor bucket list you didn't get to do? Uh, win Sole Survivor?\nNo, I'm kidding. -(laughs)\n-Not yet. That one's still up for grabs. VENUS:\n There's always a chance to change the jury's minds. Every single person can sway me\nwith what they have to say. Q:\n It's not won yet. You can go in and change minds, so don't blow it. SODA:\n I'm not just gonna\n hand money out. You need to have done something. MARIA:\n If you can't\n connect the dots for me, I can't give you my vote. TEVIN:\n What did you do? Tell me that and stand on it. If you can do that, you'll get my vote. LIZ:\n Right now, I have no idea who I'm gonna vote for. TIFFANY: A million dollars\n is a lot of money. I'm not just giving it to you 'cause you cute or we homies. HUNTER:\n I'm about to give somebody\na million dollars. Show that you knew\n what you were doing and why you deserve to win this game. All right.\nCharlie, Kenzie, Ben--\nglad to see smiles. You should be smiling. You made it to the final three. You did what 15 other players could not do. You survived every Tribal\nthat you went to. And now, one of the most\nunique aspects of Survivor is that\nthe power shifts from this side to the jury. Eight players who also were in this game\nbut were voted out-- they decide who wins based on who they think\nplayed the best game. Tonight, you have one job. Convince them it's you. This is where you step up\nand claim your victory, that you're the one\ndeserving of the title of Sole Survivor\nand the million-dollar check that goes along with it. Jury, I'm gonna\ngive you a moment, and we'll get started\nwith our final Tribal Council. If a dv an ce d lu ng c an ce r has you searching\nfor possibilities, discover a different\nfirst treatment.

Tonight is\nyour first opportunity to ask them the questions\nyou need to decide who played the best game. Let's get into it. Who wants to get us started? -I will.\n-Go, Tiff. Well, first of all,\ngood evening. And on behalf of myself and everybody sitting here\non the jury, we want to say congratulations\non making it to final three. We have very specific questions\nfor you guys tonight, and we're looking\nfor very specific answers. Also, please understand, we are not looking\nfor Taylor Swift lyrics. We are not looking\nfor pop culture or rock and roll references.\nWe are looking for serious\nand thought-provoking responses. And with that being said, can you articulate one move that you made on your own that changed the course\nof the game? I would like Ben to go first. That's a hard one. For me, I got dealt a hand that really sucked\nwhen I entered the merge, and I had to rely\non my social game. I felt one thing\nthat I did help contribute to that was sort of a move, was go to the people who had given me\nan opportunity to talk and people\nwho had been on the outs of their crew,\nbringing people together, mainly going to Kenzie,\nCharlie and Liz. TIFFANY: So, your move\nwas that you brought Kenzie, Charlie, and Liz together to\nchange the course of the game? -Of getting me out.\n-Of getting Q out to... Okay.\n-Yeah. Which was late, but again,\nlike I said, I was not dealt -the best hand.\n-TIFFANY: Charlie,\nyou have something -to say?\n-CHARLIE: Yes.\nJust, on that point, when this alliance\ncame together, Kenzie, Ben, Liz and Venus all wanted Q out\nin the final seven vote. But a big part\nof my game was making sure that there was a four\ngoing into six, 'cause I needed Q and Maria\nas shields, and if Q had gone out there\nwhen Maria won immunity at final six, I, probably, am sitting\non the jury. -Okay, well, since we're on you,\ncan you tell me what\n-Yeah. -the move is that you made that\nchanged the course of the game?\n-My... The move that I would pick\nwould be the Hunter vote. At the Hunter vote, there was\nactually an initial plan from Kenzie\nto blindside you, Tiff. But Hunter's\na real social threat and strategic threat,\nespecially given he's got strong allies\nof Soda and Tevin on the jury. That was also the day\nthat I beat Hunter in individual immunity. You know, that was, to me,\na big accomplishment. So I thought that was the time\nto go after Hunter and build out my options. HUNTER:\nNot to take away the move\nthat you made, but I came into this Tribal\ngonna play my idol. I had the Shot in the Dark\nand the idol in my pocket. And the person that\nactually convinced me not to is, uh, Kenzie. She, like, sold me on that. TIFFANY:\nOkay, thank you. -Kenzie?\n-KENZIE: Okay, so, post-merge, I wanted Tim to go. I knew I couldn't beat him, and\na lot of us had that thought. But at the same time,\nTiff and Q, who were my number-one allies, did not like Ben at all. So it was back and forth between\nTim and Ben all afternoon. Q would come over to me and be\nlike, \"It's Ben. Let's vote Ben. -He has the idol.\"\n-Q: No, no, no. -I was never gonna vote Ben.\n-KENZIE: To me... Tiff? -I have to agree with Kenzie.\nWe went back and forth\n-No. -Thank you. Yes, you did.\n-several times between Tim and Ben\nthat day in the woods, -which is why I also was upset.\n-KENZIE: All day. -Y'all did, right?\n-KENZIE: No, you did. -You did... with us.\n-No, no. No. You might have woken up\nwith that Tim, but you had Ben at 02:00,\nyou had Tim at 2:30, you had... -Nope.\n-KENZIE: At the last minute, you said, \"Fine, you can\nhave Ben.\" And then I said... -And go Tiff.\n-Wait. Tiffany said -she wanted Ben, not Q.\n-I'm saying -you guys were\narguing about it all day.\n-Q: You wanted Ben out. Q, I'd like for Kenzie\nto answer the question. Well, I'm not about\nto argue on this jury right now. -Right.\n-LIZ: I don't want to argue.\n-KENZIE: Regardless, when I was playing\nwith someone like Q, I can't fight with that.\nObviously. He doesn't remember\nwhat he says to me. You know what I mean?\nSo I had to play in a way that Q would hear me\nand think it was his idea. Like, that\nwas an intentional move that I wanted\nwhen I won immunity. We went back and forth all day, and I was the last one with\nthe whisper that made it happen. All right, who's up? Me. The question\nI have for each of you is what is one mistake\nthat you made in this game that you were ultimately able\nto flip on its head and capitalize on\nto use to your advantage? -Charlie?\n-Okay. V, I'm so glad\nthis question came from you. At the very first vote\nin merge limbo, there were-- I don't know--\nten votes for Mo and one vote for Venus. Also, after that vote, Q gave me a big old thump on the back. And let me tell you,\nwhen Q thumps you on the back, you notice it. He took me down to the boat,\nlecturing me on, you know, why\nI shouldn't have done that move. I was very receptive\nto everything you said, and I wanted to, in that moment,\nbuild a relationship with someone who was\nhaving a lot of power early in the game.\nThe next morning, Q invites me in to the six, and I was part\nof a new alliance. So-- very fun. MARIA:\nI just want to be clear that I invited you into the six. So you came into the six\non my invitation. Yes, you were my recommendation\nletter into the six. -I didn't have one.\n-In hindsight, it's not that... -It's just not great to be\n-It's literally, like... -No, no, no.\n-part of the six. MARIA: You don't want to be\npart of the six. This six is... TIFFANY:\nYou probably should have -just left that part out, then.\n-(Hunter mumbling) -Look at his laugh.\n-CHARLIE: I just... -I love the six, you know.\n-Q: Being in the six -was a one-way ticket home.\n-(laughing) KENZIE:\nLike, y'all can keep your six. HUNTER:\nWe just never talked about it. It just was a pathetic excuse\nfor an alliance. So, Kenzie, you're up. -Good-good response, though.\n-KENZIE: One mistake I made was I got cocky. I wasn't paying attention.\nI got confident, I got comfortable,\nand ultimately, Tiff went home. Tiff and I were like,\n\"Don't even play the idol, girl. Like, you'll get into six.\nWe're good.\" -We were riding too high\ntogether, okay?\n-We were. I'll be the first to admit it.\nI got cocky, too, girl. -That's why I'm over here.\n-KENZIE: Yeah, we... That hit me like a bullet train.\nI immediately started rebuilding relationships\nwith everyone, paying attention\nto who was working with who, and it became very apparent that\nMaria and Q were number ones, which led the three of us and Liz coming together\nto ultimately take out the two biggest threats\nwho had started working together -at that vote.\n-Q: So, of course. -Yeah.\n-Q: Did y'all come together at six or seven?\n'Cause at seven, why would Ben write your name\nas the contingency plan? 'Cause he was drunk on pizza. That's what I'm saying.\nSo, I'm confused. KENZIE:\nThat is the question\nof the hour. We... we worked together\nat seven, but just because\nBen wrote my name down, whether it wasn't an accident\nor not, I didn't go home. Well, she had an idol.\nIf she would've played it, you would have. Maybe. But we were working together, and we all ultimately decided. That is true. KENZIE:\nYeah. Thank you, Liz. But just to address\nthe-the accidental voting. -Yeah.\n-TEVIN: I know you had\nate pizza, but were you a bit lackadaisical\nin the tribe, and you weren't... -you listening during Tribal,\nand that's...\n-BEN: No. I think, on top of me having pizza in my stomach, I have been having night terrors\nsince about day 13 or 14. The truth is I lost my bearings. I was really as out of it\nas it could be. -Yeah. Okay. Got it.\n-And we can all appreciate that. There's a lot of us looking back at Tribal Council,\nshould have seen red flags. I mean, we're talking\nabout idol, idol, idol, idol. And so,\nI'll give you the benefit -of the doubt, you know.\n-BEN: Yeah. Sometimes Tribals are a little\nbit crazy, and we miss things. Yeah. PROBST:\nWho's up? -Tevin.\n-TEVIN: Hi, y'all. So, my question\nto you all tonight is I want your\none best example of how you used one of us\nsitting up here on the jury to further your game\nand make it to the final three. -Let's start with Ben.\n-BEN: All right. At some point in the game,\nI was stuck with Q and Maria for, like,\nthree days straight. For those three days, all I was fed was,\n\"This is what you need to do, this is who\nyou shouldn't trust.\" Nobody asked me\nwhat my input was on anything. There was no moment\nwhere it was like, \"Hey, this is what I think\nour next move has to be.\" -Well, that's the point.\n-So, can I ask\nthe follow-up question? -BEN: Totally.\n-Wouldn't you assert your ideas -Yeah.\n-on the group to try\nto make a move of your own? I took my \"chillin' hard\"\napproach, which was, \"I'm gonna listen,\nI'm gonna hear what they have to say,\" and using\nthat information is what I went to Kenzie with,\nI went to Charlie with, what I went to Liz with, and it's what allowed me\nto slip through the cracks, whether I was thought of\nas a threat or not. -Thank you.\n-Thank you.\n-Thank you. Kenzie, you're up. KENZIE:\nSo, after the Tiff\nblindside, I was out for blood, and then\nI had to manage my emotions. I wanted Q out\nimmediately after. I was so upset, I was so hurt. But I had to placate\nand pretend to go with numbers to gain Q's trust back\nto get back in good graces. And that's how quick I went from\ndevastated crying all night, out for blood to, \"Okay,\nI'm back working with the guy \"that I want out of here\nso I can get him out tomorrow if I can gain his trust today.\" -Great.\n-Thank you.\n-Excellent. -Charlie?\n-Charlie?\n-Concise. Uh, so, for me, the person\nthat I used was actually Tevin. For me, coming into the merge,\nNami was an enigma. They're either the best actors\nin the world or there are really\ncracks everywhere. -Yeah.\n-But there was so much\ninformation going around because Soda was telling me she was tight with Tevin,\nbut here Tevin was saying he wanted\nto blindside Soda, and what I figured out from that is\nthat Tevin was the power player. Okay. -Thank y'all.\n-CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah. HUNTER:\nI got it ready, Jeff. -Okay. Go, Hunter.\n-HUNTER: Okay. So, last Tribal Council,\nBen was on the hot seat and had to lay out\na lot of information as to who he saw as threats, who can make fire and not. So, my question is gonna be\nfor Charlie and for Kenzie. If you were in Ben's seat, who would you put in fire\nand why would you do it? I would have put the exact\nsame thing that Ben did. I would have gone against Liz. I know that these two boys have a similar game\nand that I have a better chance at beating them\nthan I had beating Liz. And I would have\ntaken a chance on myself. -That's what I would have done.\n-HUNTER: Awesome. Appreciate it. -Charlie?\n-Yes. So, if I had won\nthe necklace that day, I think I would have done things\na little bit differently. -Okay.\n-I think I would have taken Liz with me to the final three. I think, personally, my game could stack up well\nagainst hers. I think that's someone\nthat I could have beat, -despite her being a threat.\n-HUNTER: Okay, well, then, was there any moment\nthat you thought, \"Hey, Ben, let me do this? Let me put myself in,\nbecause Liz isn't the threat\"? My game has been all about\ngetting to this moment. So I didn't feel the need\nto push insanely hard to get into fire for a move that I didn't think was\ngoing to buy me all that much. HUNTER:\nRight, and I appreciate that. But I hope getting to this point in a safe way\ndoesn't hurt you, right? You said your goal\nwas to get to this point. I hope your goal\nwas to win this game. You better believe it.\nThat has been my laser focus this whole time. My goal was\nto win this freaking game. Okay. Yup. -Soda?\n-SODA: Um, I have been on the jury the longest. Um, I have been listening,\num, to a lot. Ben, my take on you was that you\nwere playing an emotional game and that you had no agency. Charlie, my take on you was that you were playing the middle\nvery closely with Maria, but you did not set yourself\napart from her. And, Kenzie, my take on you was that you were brought\ninto votes pre-merge. And post-merge, you said,\n\"Tell me who to vote for.\" Now, I've heard a lot\nof information that, you know, contests\nsome of those things, but I want each of you to take 30 seconds to either prove me right\nor persuade me why I'm wrong. Also, I'll be\nthe 30-second timer. When I say \"time,\" please stop. SODA:\nKenzie? So, I'm a social player. I'm not the loudest voice\nin the room. I'm not the one\nwho's gonna be a driving force, but I am a number, and I am\nalso thinking strategically. Like, my social game\nis my strategic game. They are one and the same.\nI know they're supposed to be separate,\nbut I'm a people person. I've had deep conversations\nwith each of you. I've, like, held half of you while you've cried\nabout various things. Like, yeah, I got\nbrought along on votes. That's how I ended up here. -I'll take it. I'll own it.\nIt's true.\n-TIFFANY: Time. -I'm not gonna say\nI drove a vote. Okay.\n-SODA: Time. Nice ownership. Thank you.\nCharlie? CHARLIE:\nMaria and I were\npartners in crime for a lot of the game,\nbut by the time Maria was winding back her fist to throw a punch at me, I had already\nput the pieces in place that were setting up her demise. I put together the four\nthat protected me from the punch that you and Q\nthrew at me at final six, and ultimately voted both of you\nout of the game at six and at five,\nexactly how I designed after the Tiffany vote. I thought that I needed... -to differentiate...\n-Time.\n-Time. -Ben?\n-Oh, yeah. I mean,\nI'll definitely agree. I'm probably\nthe most emotional person, most \"cries in this game\"\nthis season, but that's what I had to do, and it crushed me that I felt I came\ninto the merge with this plan that got wrecked, and I was very fortunate that how emotional I was\nopened the doors to make friendships and bonds that allowed me\nto be part of moves that I wanted to be part of.\nAnd, yeah, I openly admitted\nI was a goat for a few votes. But when the turn came\nto not be that, the only way -that would have happened...\n-Time. -SODA: Time.\n-Yeah. Cool. Thank you all so much.\nI know that was hard, um, -but you all did great.\n-BEN: All good. Q, you haven't asked a question. All righty.\nThe most important thing for me and my vote\nis this simple question. What do you plan\nto do with the money and how will it change\nyour life? -Ben?\n-Um, you know, I'm a musician. I get a lot\nof great things in my life, but I don't make a lot of money. I want to give my parents\nsome sort of retirement 'cause they're hardworking\nimmigrants that always put food\non the table and weren't around\nbecause of how hard they worked. And at the same time,\nI want to join up with my best friend's\nnonprofit program and help bring music education back to schools\nin South Florida. It's an initiative I've already\nbeen a part of called Young Musicians Unite. And having an artistic\nexpression for kids is a way for them to feel comfortable\nwith who they are, which is something\nI had to learn the hard way 'cause nobody gave me that\nopportunity when I was a kid. Q:\nThank you, Ben. -Charlie?\n-CHARLIE: Yeah, so, number one: family is more\nimportant to me than anything. And to be where I am at\nin my life-- you know, I'm 25 years old, and a million dollars\nis a whole lot of money. Life-changing. I can set up\nthe rest of my life for me and my family. You know, part of this\nexperience has been getting to meet\nand know all of you. And if there's one thing\nI know, it's that every single person here\nhad something bigger than themselves\nthey were playing for. I've talked with a lot of you\nabout the work that I do. I've worked a lot\nin immigration law. There's a lot of organizations\nthat I would want to make a donation to,\nand I would also want to, you know, bet on myself and pay\nfor law school with this money. Thank you, Charlie. -Kenzie?\n-KENZIE: I've been in my career\nsince I was 15 years old, not because it sounded fun. I would have loved to enjoy\nhigh school like a normal kid. I couldn't. I started working in salons\nwhen I was 15, got my beauty license\nby the time I was 17, opened my salon\nby the time I was 24. I opened it\nto give people a place to work. I don't make any money off\nof the chairs that I rent out. If a business person\nlooked at my business plan, they would lose their minds\nand be like, \"You could make so much money\noff of this.\" It's not about the money. The\nbusiness is not about the money. It's about providing people\nan opportunity. So this money\nwould be mine, for me. I would invest it and I would\nset up myself so I don't have to be 70 years old\ndoing bang trims on kids, okay? -(laughing)\n-Like, I'm trying to set myself up\nto have a family and to be able to be\nfinancially secure in myself. This was my venture.\nMy life is... has been for everyone else. -Q: Thank you so much.\n-No problem. Q:\nYes, ma'am. Well done, jury. Every single question got different information. Well done. Thank you. Charlie, Kenzie, Ben, I'm gonna give you 30 seconds. -Okay.\n-PROBST: If you think there was something\nnot brought up that is pertinent to your game,\nthis is your chance to make it. Charlie, 30 seconds. A pattern I wanted to highlight was \"never close a door.\" Always keep my options open. Everyone here knows\nthat I've strategized with them at one point or another\nin the game. It's what gave me options. It's what let me see my position\nin the game, stay safe and have power. That's how I feel like\nI got here today, and I really just wanted to hit\nthat point home to all of you. I think I played hard.\nThank you for listening. -PROBST: Kenzie?\n-Thank you. KENZIE:\nOh, to sum it up, um, I went on every sanctuary reward\nbecause I am a social butterfly. I competed\nin every single challenge from the first one\nto the fire-making. Won two of those,\nthanks to some help, because you get by with a little help\nfrom your friends. I came in here trying to make\nfriends, and thank you all for listening. Um... Yeah. I... I just love you all. Thank you so much. (laughs) -Thank you, Kenzie.\n-Thank you.\n-PROBST: Ben. Not that I think\nit stacks up against them, but, uh, with everything\nI've been through in my life, I did want to come here\nand be the emotional me and not the bravado frontman\nperformer version of me. And even though\nI had a hard time with the night terrors, I got from the bottom\nand had fun climbing my way through moves\ntowards the end. I played the game I wanted\nto play, and I'm glad I got to meet y'all,\nbecause y'all rock, and... -Q: Thank you.\n-Who rocks? -Thanks, Ben.\n-You rock.\n-You rock. TIFFANY:\nThanks, Ben. -I'll accept that.\n-Right. The one, right? Come on. That's for you there. -(laughing)\n-PROBST: Charlie, Kenzie, Ben,\nit's not easy to sit in those seats\nand defend your game, but you have to claim your victory,\nand one of you just did. The question is who. The only thing left to do\nis vote. -(laughing)\n-(grunts) CHARLIE: I love you guys. \u266a \u266a ( \u266a \u266a ) This is a hot flash. This is a hot flash.

LYBALVI helps us push back against bipolar 1. Once-daily prescription\n LYBALVI is proven to treat manic\n or mixed episodes of bipolar 1 in adults, to help you\n push back. Elderly patients with\n dementia have increased risk of\n death or stroke. Do not take LYBALVI\n if you are taking opioids or are in opioid withdrawal. The samidorphan in LYBALVI can\n cause severe opioid withdrawal that can lead to\n hospitalization or increase risk of life-threatening\n overdose.

        "transcript":"\u266a \u266a GABE:\nI want to be the very first head on the Mount Rushmore\n of the new era. AYSHA:\nI am ready to forge my own path. ROME:\n I'm 100% gonna be writing\nmy own Survivor story out here. CAROLINE:\n Listen, I am either gonna blaze my own path out here or\nI'm gonna burn down this island. SAM:\n I think I am dangerous\n in Survivor. I have what it takes,\n physically, but I'm versatile enough to fit\ninto different groups of people. You don't find a guy\n who looks like me be super unsuspecting, right? It's often the people that say,\n\"Oh, I'm a... I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing.\" I'm a wolf in wolf's clothing. \u266a \u266a AYSHA:\n I march to the beat\n of my own drum. And no matter how nerdy it is, these are the things\n I love in life. But I don't do anything\nunless I'm gonna succeed at it. (whooping) 'Cause I just don't like losing. I look like somebody\n who wouldn't hurt a fly, but they don't know,\nlike, I have a flyswatter in my back pocket. (laughs) KYLE:\n Growing up,\n life was a struggle, man. I spent five years in foster care,\nover 26 different homes I lived in before\n I would graduate high school. I could have just flipped over\n and laid on my back, but I didn't. Life dealt me the recipe\n for disaster, and I baked\na ... brownie with it. PROBST:\n These 18 strangers will be abandoned\n in the islands of Fiji. TIYANA:\n I am the first native\n Hawaiian to play Survivor. I want to show that Hawaii can roll\nwith the big dogs. (howling) PROBST:\n They must learn to adapt\n or they'll be voted out. JON:\n I am sure that I have friends\n and family watching this right now. And I'm pretty confident\n that I know what they want for me out of this experience. They want me to suffer. PROBST:\nIn the end, only one will remain to claim\n the million-dollar prize. ANIKA:\n I'm gonna play hard. I might get a little evil.\n Who knows? (cackling) SUE: When I win Survivor, my final words will be,\n \"I'm 59, and I beat all your asses.\" Who will have what it takes\nto outwit, outplay and outlast\nall the rest? This is Survivor 47. \u266a \u266a -(laughing, whooping)\n-(clapping) You're here. -Oh, my God.\n-Oh, my gosh. TK: I would say, looking\n at my fellow contestants, uh, I see a million dollars, man.\nLike, I really don't think\n I see anybody on here who can do anything with me,\n to be honest. So, I'm ready to go. All right.\nWelcome to Survivor 47. (whooping) -It's crazy.\n-PROBST: So, every season of Survivor starts the same way, with the forming\nof a new community. That's what's happening\nright now. Take a look around. This is gonna be your community for the next 26 days. And the reason community has always been the foundation of this social experiment\nwe've been doing for 24 years is because humans\nhave always craved community. And I get it. If you're at home\nwatching Survivor, you could say\n\"Ah, it doesn't fully jibe. \"I mean, they're not\nreally abandoned. You're not really on your own.\"\nThat's true. There are cameras\nshooting you right now. But what you all\nare going to experience because you're here is that when you're tired\nand you're hungry or you feel left out,\nit's gonna feel very real because you're gonna\nhave those same cravings for community. And what truly\nsets Survivor apart from any other social experiment\nlike this is the game\nthat sits on top of it, a game that's\nplayed with humans. The same humans you are\nforming your community with are your adversaries. So you have to build a community with people you can rely on\nwhile you vote them out and then\nafter you vote them out, you go back to them\nand try to persuade them to give you the vote\nfor the million dollars. How do you pull off\nthat magic trick? So let's see if we can solidify\nyour community a little bit by giving you an identity\nwith a tribe name. We'll start with Blue.\nBlue, you are Tuku. -Tuku!\n(cheering, whooping) In the middle, Red, Lavo. -Lavo!\n-(cheering)\n-Yes. And on the end, Gata. -Gata!\n-Gata.\n-(cheering) PROBST:\nAll right,\nso let's see if we can get a little personality\nfrom our tribes. Guy in the front, in the middle,\nwhat's your name? My name is Gabe,\nfrom Baltimore City. What do you bring\nto your community back home? I mean, when it comes to\nworking, I'm a grinder, man. I try to lead by example,\nand I try to be the guy that says, \"I'm just\nas tired as you are, but \"if I got energy to keep going,\nI know for sure that you got energy\nto keep going.\" In the front, in the middle,\nintroduce yourself. Uh, my name is Teeny.\nI know it looks like I'm from the Wild Wild West\nright now, but I'm actually\na proud New Jerseyan. I feel like this is, like,\naggressively scarecrow, and, uh, that's not really\nNew Jersey's vibe, but, you know, I like to change it up\nwith, like, my style. Just to be clear, it's not like I gave you these pants. -These are your...\n-No, I... I... It's my style. It's my style.\nI own it. I'm just saying:\nNew Jersey proud. (laughing) PROBST:\nGuy in the corner. -What's your name?\n-Hi. I'm Andy. Andy, talk to us\nabout your role back home. What's your life about? Growing up,\nI had, like, four friends. So unpopular because\nI did not have an identity, and I kept trying\ndifferent things. I would wear\nGrateful Dead T-shirts to be... pretend I was a stoner. I'm afraid of weed. -I can't smoke weed.\nI can't do that.\n-(laughing) I was a poser, right?\nBut I learned that I just have to be myself, and it's become a super magnet for everyone in my life\nthat I have today. -PROBST: Guy on the end.\n-Yeah. -Introduce yourself.\n-I'm Jon. I'm a podcast host, and I really care\nwhat people think of me. (laughing) So much.\nFour friends in high school? Must be nice. (laughing) PROBST:\nWell, Jon, it's always so exciting to start\na new season of Survivor. So, what's the energy right now? You know,\nI'm here in part because every episode you say,\n\"Apply to be on Survivor.\" And you have this idea of what you would play like or what you could play like. And I think\nwe're all nervous because what we would play like\nor could play like is about to be fact-checked\nagainst what we will play like. -PROBST: Wow.\n-And if you're cocky,\nthat's exciting. (laughing) And if you're not, it's not. (laughing) Well, shall we get\nto the next phase? -(all voicing assent)\n-PROBST: All right. Your first test as new tribes is waiting for you\nin the jungle. -AYSHA: Oh, my God.\n-Follow me. AYSHA:\nOh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. ANDY: Jeff walks us down the beach, turns a corner\n and takes us to... It could only be described as, like, a gladiator's arena. Look, I've seen a lot\n of Survivor. There are opening challenges, but this one\n really takes the cake in terms of the grandness. And the pressure is on.\n Like, you have to perform or you're gonna\nbe in trouble immediately. All right. Let's get to your\nfirst challenge as new tribes. Here's how it works. Two players from each tribe are gonna crawl\n under a muddy net. You're gonna race\n into the jungle... ...and retrieve\n two puzzle pieces from one of three\n different obstacles. Then you race back,\n the next pair goes. Once you have all six pieces, two tribe members\n will use those pieces to solve a rectangular puzzle. The first tribe to finish earns their camp supplies. You know the drill. It's not much--\na pot, a machete and a flint-- but out here, it's everything, and will provide\na massive head start. The two losing tribes will have\nto try to earn it another way. -Make sense? All right,\n-Yup. give everybody a minute\nto strategize, we'll get started. -All right.\n-SUE: Let's go. Here we go. First challenge of Survivor 47. Survivors ready? (cheering) -Go! You're going out in pairs.\n-(cheering) Get through that mud. Come on, guys! SIERRA:\nCome on, Gata! That mud is birthing you\ninto Survivor right there. SUE:\nLet's go! Yeah! (whoops)\nGo, Caroline, go! PROBST:\nThere goes Kyle\nin the lead for Tuku. Camp supplies on the line. Biggest head start\nyou can get in this game is the pot, the machete\nand the flint. (cheering) -Let's go!\n-(whooping) All right, here we go.\nLet's go. -I'm on left.\n-Okay, go. PROBST:\nWorking together\nto free up these puzzle pieces. Got to get\nall that rope through. -They're all spooled up.\n-All right. Watch that one. -O-Over.\n-Watch out. PROBST:\nOnce your pieces\nare free, you can head back. These pieces are heavy. Sam heading back\nwith the first piece for Gata. SIERRA:\nCome on, Gata! -(whooping)\n-Let's go, Sam! -(overlapping shouting)\n-I see you! Come on! Aysha has her piece.\nKishan has his. SAM:\nCome on. PROBST: Sam's back to help. -Okay. Ready?\n-Yeah. Yeah.\n-PROBST: Kyle and Caroline still -working for Tuku.\n-KYLE: Okay. How do you feel about it? KYLE: Keep going. SOL:\nThere we go. There we go. That's how you do it\non Survivor, right there! -(cheering)\n-Let's go! Got to get back with both\npieces. Keep going, Aysha. You're good, Lavo. Head out.\nIt's Teeny and Genevieve. SUE:\nGuys, get ready. -Go!\n-You're good, Gata! Head out! Rachel and Jon. Go, Jon! Go, Rachel! PROBST:\nYou're good, Tuku. Head out. It's Gabe and Sue. CAROLINE:\nYes! Make it up. PROBST: Jon whipping that rope. Wow!\n-This way, this way. -Okay.\n-PROBST: Teeny and Genevieve\ndoing a nice job working together. Threading that rope through. Sue has hers, Gabe has his. -Tuku, you can head back.\n-TEENY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Sue! Lok at that. PROBST:\nGabe heading back with a piece. Sue heading back with a piece. -Go, go, go.\n-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Go! TK:\nThere we go, let's go! Let's go, Tuku! Get 'em back to the tower. You're good, Tuku. Head out. -Tiyana and TK. Whoa.\n-Whoa! TK whipping through the mud. (overlapping shouting) You're good, Gata. Go! Sierra and Andy. PROBST:\nLavo, you got to keep moving. You're good. Head out. Sol and Rome. The last two. TK heads back to his team. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:\nSol heading back with\na puzzle piece for Lavo. Lavo's closing the gap\nright now. Rome is free.\nIt's now Gata in dead last. Andy and Sierra-- they have\nblown the little lead they had. Tuku with their final\npuzzle piece. You're good, Tuku.\nStart solving the puzzle. It's probably the, um...\nLet's try it. PROBST:\nIt is Caroline and Kyle\nfor Tuku. That's gonna be an end piece? Solving a rectangular puzzle. Have to just put in... -All right, let's go.\n-Lavo, you're good. -Start working on the puzzle.\n-Oh. -Go, Gata!\n-Come on, Gata! PROBST:\nHere comes Andy.\nHe's got one piece. Gata still has one piece left. -Can you catch it?\n-PROBST: Gata's dead\nlast right now. (grunting) Now you're good, Gata.\nStart working. Rachel and Anika trying to make up\na lot of time for Gata, who are working together to solve a complicated Survivor puzzle, with tribe supplies on the line. We scoot it once.\nThat could go... here. PROBST:\nThere is no second place today, just two losers. -Yeah.\n-Yes, and then that one there.\n-PROBST: Gata now has new momentum. Anika and Rachel\nfeeling excited now that maybe\nthey have something sorted. -Yes, guys!\n-Yep. -Yes!\n-This one right here. -This one right here.\n-Gata with a lot\nof enthusiasm right now. Guys, guys, don't worry,\ndon't worry, don't worry. -Let's go!\n-PROBST: Is this it? Have they solved it? -Yes, go!\n-They got here last. Can they finish first? -Push it in there! Yeah!\n-Put that in there! PROBST:\nPut the top on. -Oh, my God.\n-You got to get up. Why you never give up\nin this game, ever. -Let's go! Let's go!\n-Let's go! PROBST:\nThey got to get the top on. And they've got it!\nGet to the top! -(whooping)\n-PROBST: It's over! Gata wins tribe supplies. -That's it.\n-(whooping) PROBST:\nA lot of effort from Gata\nto stay in this. -That was hard. That's no joke.\n-No, that was tough. -GENEVIEVE: Good try.\n-PROBST: Wow. None of us could get it. One, two, three. GATA:\nGata! All right.\nGata, congratulations. -(whooping)\n-Tribe supplies are yours.\nIt's not much. A pot, a machete and a flint. But out here, it is everything. Come grab it.\nAlong with a map to your home. Gata, grab your stuff, head out.\nYou get the big advantage of starting work on your camp. SAM:\nThank you, Jeff. -Good job, guys. Good job.\n-Thank you. -Killer. You were a killer.\n-Oh, thank you. PROBST:\nAll right, Tuku, Lavo, no tribe supplies for you. You're gonna have\nto try to earn them another way. Here's how it's gonna work. Each tribe's gonna choose\none person to take on this task. You're not gonna get any information\nabout what is required, so you're making a blind choice. How about rock, scissors,\nodd man out goes? -Do you want to go?\n-No. All right, who's it gonna be? All right,\nAysha's going for Lava. Tuku, how about you?\nMake a decision? There's three people\nthat want to go, so that's why\nwe're gonna either throw a rock or scissors,\nand then the odd man out goes. I love this! -Yeah.\n-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors. -Geez.\n-Not you throwing paper,\nand we said rock first. Is that what you said? (laughing) TIYANA:\nBut, yeah, you're odd man out. Decision has been made. We have Aysha for Lavo,\nTK for Tuku. You two are heading\nout together. Head down.\nBoat'll pick you up. Good luck. All right, Tuku,\nmap to your new home. -Thank you.\n-Lavo, map to your home.\n-Hey, yeah, baby. -Yeah!\n-Grab your stuff, head out. -Good luck.\n-Thank you. -Thanks, Jeff.\n-Thank you, Jeff. ROME: Aysha chose\n to go on this journey, which-- props to you,\nbut big mistake. The social game\n is the biggest aspect of the game of Survivor, and I am not gonna miss out on those first few hours\nof strategizing.

(whooping) -Victory.\n-Okay, you guys,\nwe got to give it a second. Group hug. We did that.\nWe really did that. RACHEL:\n This is the best moment\n of my life. I love competition\nand I love to win. SAM:\nYeah, let's go in the water. RACHEL:\nYeah, let's do that.\nLet's do that. Okay, let's go, let's go! RACHEL:\n We solved that puzzle, 100%, because of good communication. Like, it was a community effort, like, full stop. SIERRA:\nGuys, I'm just so proud to be a part of a winning team. (laughing) JON: It felt like baptism\n by mud. Like, we're gonna win this challenge and\nevery challenge that follows. JON:\nWe don't really know each other,\n but this is a tribe that can win challenges\nbecause we did. I live in Los Angeles. No, I started in WeHo,\nwhere all the gays go. I was a speechwriter\nfor a while. -Okay.\n-Whoa! And then I started a podcast -called Pod Save America. -Wow. JON:\n I was a speech writer\n for Hillary Clinton back when she was a senator\n and then I became a speechwriter in the\nWhite House for President Obama. And now, when people\nask me what I do, I have to say that\nI'm a ... podcast host. -Am I good?\n-You're good. You're good. JON:\n When I was a closeted teen, I watched Richard Hatch\n win the first season. I ran around the house screaming about\nwhat I had just witnessed. -JON: What should we do?\n-ANIKA: Most important thing: -shelter?\n-Yeah.\n-Yeah. JON:\n And now, all these\n years later, I'm here. I feel a little bit like\nthe dog that caught the car. -So, something with a...\n-A piece of bamboo across, like, that? -And then one over there.\n-Yeah, something\nwith, like, a crotch. I am a numbers guy\n and that's how I want to play this game. Because I look at Survivor as ultimately, a numbers game. -Good? All right.\n-Yup. ANDY:\n There are only six\n people on the tribe, but that constitutes\n 15 one-on-one relationships. You could do the math.\n It's a pretty simple equation. It's a combination. Six, choose two, factorial equals 15. So if I connect with two people, it would actually be very hard\n to get voted out. ANDY: Because if I could\n count on two people to not write my name down, it would be very difficult\nfor four people to write my name down. Who has to come out\nto their own girlfriend? And I'm like, \"Okay.\"\nAnd they're great vibes. But I'm just saying,\nI just think, you know, we just have that... -We don't need to try.\n-I love it. -I love it.\n-You know what I mean?\n-Unspoken. -Guys, like, unspoken.\n-All right. (laughing) (laughing) SUE: I like your idea\nof getting a shelter started. Let's do it. -The more we have,\nthe more comfortable we'll be.\n-Yeah. TIYANA:\nNot winning that challenge today actually sunk me to my core. Fingers crossed\n that TK comes through and brings back something good\nfor this tribe, because we're gonna\nneed it tonight. What type of vibe\nare we going for here? Looking around at my tribe,\n I feel like we stack up incredibly well\nin terms of physical strength. SUE:\nYou guys rock. This is crazy. (laughs) TIYANA:\n But puzzle-wise, we have some work to do. Tie? Uh, I mean,\nat least for right now. If we find more,\nwe can always reinforce it. Coming into this game, I want\n to work with an older person. I want to work with somebody who's a little more mature\n because I got a bit of an old soul\nin me, right? SUE: Uh-huh. What?! In my opinion, an older person-- they know how to operate\n without getting caught up in the social games of it all. That's somebody\nwho I want my day one, number one\nalliance member to be. People are gonna be running\naround with their heads cut off. People are gonna\nbe whispering at Tribal. When that happens... Thank you. Ditto. GABE:\n Let these kids gossip\nand clique up among themselves. We'll run things in the shadows. Yeah. -Grandson. Aiden.\n-Grandson. -Yeah.\n-Aiden. How old is he? He's four. I love Caroline.\n She is literally the sweetest person\nin the world. Survivor is really\nmy mom's and I thing. Now, see, it's me and Chelsea's.\nSame thing, so you get it. She's so excited,\n and that's like my daughter, so, it's cool.\nLike, there's something there. Yeah. Uh, what do you mean? You're the main person\nthat I feel, like, -I've got, like...\n-Oh, good. -Oh, no, no, no. Exact opposite.\n-Okay. At my age, I thought for sure I would be the very bottom. But now I feel\n like Caroline and Gabe-- they're-they're my number ones, and so I'm feeling good with it.\n Now we're gonna be a force\nto be reckoned with. KISHAN:\n All right. We're just\n organizing them from, like, -Biggest to smallest.\n-biggest to smallest so that it's, like, a nice incline. -I think this one over here...\n-This one's got some girth. Yeah.\nSo, let's move this one. -Yep. -KISHAN: Losing that\n first challenge-- it sucks.\n We're not the tallest tribe. We didn't look to be\n the strongest, but Lava-- we're-we're resourceful. We just have to trust\nour instincts and kind of fall back onto our training\nand our, like, gut. So, that's what we're doing. Yeah! Like... KISHAN:\n I'm an emergency room doctor. I love the chaos. TEENY:\nI think it's a dead hermit crab. We could eat it. Oh... Doctor. KISHAN:\n You're just\n constantly surrounded by the unknown, and I'm so ready for that,\n'cause that's what I do every single day for a living,\nand I'm really good at it, and I'm gonna be good at it\non Survivor, too. TEENY:\nCan you guys tell me,\non a scale of one to ten, how dweeby\nmy first buff look was? It was some variation of this for all of the opening events\nof the day. Where are you gonna place it?\nGive it to me straight. -SOL: You want it straight?\n-TEENY: Yeah. SOL:\nIt's at, like,\na four and a half. -(all laughing)\n-(indistinct chatter) TEENY:\n Playing Survivor is about the social relationships\nyou make. In school, the one thing\n that I really excelled at was being able to make friends\n and talk to people. And so I'm gonna\n play this game by being every single person's\n number one. (laughing): Exac... Keyshawn and I bonded\n almost immediately. So, I mean, he's an ER doctor. He has an ability\n to work under pressure. And I feel like he's a bit more\nintroverted to my extrovert, so I felt like he was\na cool yin to my yang. I think she's\ngot the perfect vibe. -Yes.\n-I think it's gonna be great. Us three stick together,\nwe're good to go. GENEVIEVE:\n The new era of Survivor is a very fast-paced game, and right now,\n I just really like Rome. -ROME: Oh, oh, I got it.\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God, water! -(whooping)\n-(clapping)\n-SOL: Wow. GENEVIEVE:\nI like him. I get along with him so well. He's so enthusiastic. I just feel happy\nwhen I talk to him. Oh, that's so good.\nOh, my gosh. GENEVIEVE:\n I'm also trying to solidify\n something with Teeny. I would love\nto have her as my ally. (gasps) Me too. Me too. I really like Genevieve. I want to play this game\n with her. But let's remember we have\nan entire tribe member coming back here. (whoops)\nMy goodness. -So, TK.\n-How you feeling? -Aysha.\n-Nice to introduce me, -nice to meet... For sure.\n-Yes. -This is wild.\n-We have... Oh, my gosh. -Okay.\n-You want to break it down? When I read that\n one person was going to get their camp supplies\n and the other was gonna go back to camp empty-handed,\nmy stomach dropped. This man looks like he currently is in the NFL. -So, on three?\n-All right. Yes. -One, two, three.\n-One, two, three. Whoa. Here we go. Okay. What am I looking for? So, when I uncovered the clue and saw that it was a picture,\n I realized this is my guide. I have to match the two to find the key.\n It's gonna look identical. Okay. Agua. I look at this map.\n I see the first X, and it's this huge rock face\n that is near. So I'm thinking,\n\"Just look for a big rock face. I'll find the X.\" I look around-- there's, like,\neight rock faces. So, everything looks\nexactly the same. This is this rock. It's saying \"between two rocks.\" Ah, there it is.\nThat's what I'm looking for. That's it. (quietly): Yes! So, when I got my first key,\n that gives me the clue to be able\n to find that second key. A mountain of rocks. Okay.\nThis a mountain of rocks? Oh. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,\nyes, yes, yes, yes. Let's... I get that first key\n and I'm hyped. Now I got my confidence.\nNow I know I can do it. Come on, T, come on, T. (grunts) Oh! Oh, my goodness.\nYes! This is it. Perfect. I found my second key\n and I feel like I'm cooking, we're going, I have it. Okay. (sighs): Okay.\nCome on, bro. It has to be over here. Let's see if it's right here. Here it is. I never would have thought that the final key was in the ocean. This is it.\n Whoever finds the fourth key wins. See, thi-this is the tree. Yes!\nYes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, that's two keys.\n I'm hyping myself up like, \"They don't\n know who they messing with.\" All right.\nThree trees by theirselves. Come on, T. I don't even know\nhow to get back down. I don't even remember\nwhere the path was. How am I--\nI'm lost. I'm lost. Let's go. Let's go.\nNow I'm getting my rhythm. Give me my money. Uh-oh.\nHold up. In the ... ocean is insane. Well, got to go back down, then. (grunts) Oh, my God, dude,\nwhere is the exit? The forest is so dense. And I'm like, \"You know what, \"forget that path.\nMake your own path, like you've done\nyour entire life.\" I am about\nto muscle through this. Oh! (whoops) I don't care what I hit.\n I'm making my own path through this brush\n and I'm figuring it out. Where is this thing? This is the path?\nNo, this is just where I was. I can't believe being lost is what's setting me back. It's to where\nI can't get out of here because I'm lost? Where?\nCome on, come on. Oh, I can't see\nall the damn mud, dude. There we go. You got it? Oh... (sighs)\nHey, no, no, no, no. -Let's go.\n-Oh, you got it? Let's go, bro! AYSHA:\n The fact that I was\n so close-- oh, it hurt. It hurt so much. TK:\n At the end of the day,\n there is honestly no better feeling in the world\nthan seeing this pot and machete and flint. (whoops) And it's because of me. So, I'm gonna\ntake the credit on that. Nice little pat on the back. (laughs) Ooh! AYSHA:\n I was heartbroken. And I know from being\n a Survivor podcaster that going back with\n no camp supplies-- that's... surefire way to paint myself\nas a target. To m e, H ar le m is h om e. But home is also your body.

So, basically,\nit's, like, when a coconut falls to the ground\nand starts growing a new plant. If you catch it at specifically\nthe right time and you crack it open,\nit has, like, this fluffy, -foamy, like,\ngood-textured coconut.\n-RACHEL: Oh! -So, that might be a good thing.\n-And there's one-- No, it's a great thing.\nAnd it's over there and it's growing, and we\ncan all, like, have dessert. JON: Anika is just prepared. She's a prepared person. She watched\n a YouTube on coconuts and she spotted\n a sprouted coconut, which is a trendy food in Los Angeles and also available in Fiji. The first base-- we'll want it\noff the floor, right? So, we have to dig four holes. Even though I told myself before coming out here,\n\"Do not take the lead,\" I'm a project manager\n true at heart. My head cannot help but say, \"Hey, guys, these are the steps \"that need to happen\n in order to get \"from A to Z. Let's do that.\" We're gonna need\nway more bamboo. -RACHEL: Okay.\n-SIERRA: All right. Take a loop. SAM: I love Anika\n taking the leadership role, mainly because I don't want it.\n I want to be the glue guy. Every sports team\nknows what a glue guy is. They're not\nthe best on the team. They're not\nthe worst on the team. They find their way\nsomewhere in the middle, but somehow the team\njust doesn't function the same without them. RACHEL:\nWait, we can dig\nbefore we make it, right? Yeah, we can dig, we can dig. -(laughs): Oh!\n-Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Boom! -Was it right\nin between your legs?\n-No babies for you! SAM:\n It's the guy in\n a friend group that it's like, once he's there, you feel like, \"Hey, the whole group's here.\" Crisis averted. But I think if you keep\nthe glue guy around for too long in this game, you end\nup getting burned by him. You know what\nI would love a lot? Fire. ALL:\nThat's what we're doing. SAM:\nL... I love that you guys are proactive enough\nto think of it on your own. -SIERRA: Can I give the fire\na go for a second?\n-Yeah. SIERRA: I'm always\n looked at as like, \"Oh, \"just the pretty blonde\nwith, like, a cute little smile.\" I was a pageant queen. I competed at Miss USA.\n But my dad always wanted a boy, and I just ended up\n being my dad's little boy. This is for you, Dad.\nLet's see if I can do it. I'm gonna try to make fire.\n And this is why winning the first challenge\n was so important. Hot flint and a machete--\n that's everything. We wouldn't be able to build our community\n without that stuff. ANIKA:\nYep, keep going. -(whooping)\n-Fire! SAM:\nPageant queen does fire. -Pageant queen did it! -SIERRA: We're off\n to a hot start. We are killing it out here. There's no better feeling. TK: I can't wait to just see my tribemates' faces when I walk onto that camp and I have\nthe tribe supplies. (grunts) Yo, yo, where the squad at? My tribe is gonna be happy,\n and I just can't wait to see how much equity\nthat builds me in my tribe. -Whoa!\n-Whoa.\n-Oh! GABE:\nNo way! (all shrieking, cheering) (indistinct chatter) TK:\n Everybody's running up to me.\n They're doing, like, jumping and--\nlike we're in we're in the NBA or we just scored a bucket\nand we all jumping up and doing\nour shoulder bumps. -Really?\n-Only of us could get it. -And you-- Oh, bro! Oh, my God.\n-(whooping) SUE:\nWow! TK! Come on.\nWow. TK:\n There's no way, now, that you could look at me and say, \"this guy needs to go first\" or \"this guy needs to go\"\nat all. Aysha comes over and then she starts trying to, like,\nwrestle me for the key. And I'm like,\n\"Whoa, wait a minute.\" Hey, all good, man, all good.\nLook, as long as we are comfortable.\n(laughs) CAROLINE:\n Oh, my gosh, when TK arrived at camp, the guys flocked to him. Where you from? PG county. -Really?\n-TK: Yeah, man. I already know. I was\ngonna-I was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.\n-Really? -Yeah.\n-GABE: Hell yeah, dude. -Hell yeah.\n-TK: That was good times\nover there. CAROLINE: The guys fell in love with each other the moment\nthat they saw each other. KYLE:\nI live in, like, a small town. Like, \"four stoplights for\nthe whole place\" kind of thing. -GABE: Get the hell\nout of here. Really?\n-Yeah. We got a lot\nof, like, inland lakes and waterways\nthat connect to and from. CAROLINE:\n I'm not an idiot. I can tell. It's a bromance. GABE: Yeah. TK:\nHold on. I'm-I'm gonna\npull it with you, though. Hold on one second. Oh, hold on, here we go. I'm just pulling it this way.\nThere we go. GABE:\n Oh, my God. At the base\n of this really big log, I see a Beware Advantage staring\nback at me, and then I kind of lean on top of it and I just put my hand over it.\n You know, instantly, I start calculating\n in my brain, \"How can I get TK\n away from this? I'm not totally sure I want to bring him\nthat deep in quite yet. Luckily, TK leaves\n and I just get a chance alone. Once I make the decision to take it, that is set in stone. This is something\n that I want to move on fast. And a note says... \"You will dig up a box\nthat contains \"everything you need\nto claim an immunity idol. \"Until you take possession\nof the idol, \"you cannot participate\nin the vote at Tribal Council. That's why it says 'Beware.'\" I realized that\n the branch where I found the Beware Advantage was right on the path. And then, lo and behold, found this box\n with a lock on it and a tube, which has more instructions\n on what to do. It says... \"Unbraid the vines to release\nthe key that unlocks the box.\" And of course I know\n what the rock face is. It's a massive,\n massive rock base right next to our tribe's camp. So, I know I have to bring\n what's up there down to me with these vines. I can see the key wrapped around the ring on the top\n of this rock base. My precious!\nThere it is. GABE:\nDo you want to find out? I'm such an idiot. -You want to help me?\n-Yeah. GABE:\n Right away, I was like,\n let me not play coy. Let me just bring him into this right away and say, \"Let's\nfind out what this is together.\" That's a key, dude.\nDude. That's probably for the... We found a key before we found anything else. That doesn't sound right.\n Like, that's not adding up.\n So, in my mind, I'm like, \"I caught you in the act\nbut you weren't gonna \"tell me about this,\nso maybe we aren't as close as we thought we were.\" GABE: I kind of feed TK this story\nof \"I just found it\" and I think I he bought it. Yeah. I finally have this key\n in my possession, and I-I really\n need to find time to return to the box, but not be\n too hasty about it, because it just leads to mistakes. AYSHA: Riding back to camp with no camp supplies, I was so fearful. I'm just thinking, \"I haven't just disappointed\nmyself in this moment, but I've disappointed my tribe.\" Hello. Oh, Aysha! -Aysha!\n-KISHAN: Yeah! -Okay, story time, story time.\n-Oh, my God. AYSHA:\n I knew that the only way to approach talking to my tribe\nwas being honest. I literally had nothing to hide. Um, we arrived to the beach, and there's this stand and the instructions say\nthere are two paths and only one tribe was gonna get the camp supplies. TEENY:\n Being a Survivor fan, I've listened\n to Aysha's podcast before. It seems like she's very bright. She picks up on a lot of things\nthat even I miss from the show, and that could\n be helpful for my game. -Well, thank you for going.\n-GENEVIEVE: Thank you\nfor trying and going. I was like,\n\"Oh, it was for nothing.\" TEENY:\n So, the first thing I did\n was pull her aside and say, \"Listen,\nI think I know who you are. -Okay.\n-And I... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right, right, right. So, I don't plan on... -I would never tell anybody.\n-Okay. -I just wanted to tell you.\n-Thanks. So, when Teeny approached me about recognizing me\nand knowing me from Rob Has a Podcast, that made me so nervous. But I really do feel, like,\na genuine connection with Teeny. I'm just trying to make sure\nthat I'm not blindsided by... good vibes. SOL:\nYeah, Lavo. -TEENY: Yes.\n-(Genevieve laughs) AYSHA: Everyone playing\n the game of Survivor is here to win\n a million dollars, and so I'm trusting everyone until they give me a reason\n to lose trust. Who knows\nwhat's about to happen? AYSHA: Yeah. -Oh, for real?\n-Mm-hmm. Ah.\nSeems like my whole tribe likes me, which is good. I said that\n when I start this game, the main thing that I want to do is immediately start looking\n for advantages and try to do it\n in the smartest way. It is hard,\nin this new era of Survivor, to look for these advantages\nand not get caught. I need to go this way. I don't know. I just-- I... I feel like we just-- Yeah. ROME:\n On day one,\n looking for an idol-- that could put a huge target\n on your back. But at the end of the day, I want to play this game\n as hard as possible. So I have to make sure\n that if I'm looking, I am looking everywhere, and if I look everywhere, I feel like I'm-a find it. (gasps) I didn't even\n see the word \"beware.\" I just see the word \"advantage.\" That's all it is.\n Because guess what? That advantage is gonna be in my\nhands instead of someone else. It said right there at the path, you'll be able to find a box with everything you need\nto get your idol. Oh, my gosh. Once I started\n to dig on the path in the broad daylight, that was when I realized,\n\"This is not a good idea.\" Thing is, it's right there\n where everyone's walking. It's directly\n on the way to the well. And so I almost\n have to do this at night. I just feel\n absolutely incredible at how I'm playing the game\nto start things off.

For the Toughest\nJobs on Planet Earth. This is a Survivor moment\nright here. -I know.\nIt's a huge Survivor moment.\n-Right here. -Is it dead, though?\n-No, it's-it was moving. GABE: This is a group that I imagine most Survivor tribes are like in the early days,\n where everyone's just really, really excited,\nunderstandably so. -Let's run into it.\n-(Caroline whooping) -TK: Yes! Let's go!\n-CAROLINE: Let's go, Tiyana! (whoops) GABE:\n But I've had a lot of time to be excited.\n Now's not the time to be excited, now's the time\nto take care of business. It's why we're here.\nIt's what I plan to do. I found a key earlier today to unlock this box\n buried in the ground, but TK walked up and caught me. And now I'm realizing\n I need somebody to keep an eye out for me. And Sue was somebody\n that I could work with to actually accomplish the tasks that were at hand. When he told me he found\n the Beware Advantage, that was huge. Like, I never expected\nanybody to ever tell me that they found an-an advantage. -All right.\n-Okay. He'll be coming\nfrom what direction? Okay. So, I'm definitely\n gonna be the lookout for when Gabe goes off hunting\nfor this advantage. \u266a \u266a The fire's doing good. GABE:\n I hear from Sue, and I have no more time. I grab that lock that's\n hooked on the box and I just rip it out of the ground\n as hard as I possibly can and I just take off sprinting. Let me just get off this path\nas soon as I can. Wow. Oh, my God.\n When I open it, I find a second box\n within the first box. And I'm not happy about it. I broke my neck\n to get this thing, and now it comes with this big caveat. It's only good\n for one Tribal Council. If you want to keep going,\n there's another task, and that will give you\nan idol that's good for three Tribal Councils. I fancy myself a gambler\n in real life. I like betting on sports,\nI like going to the casino. Scared money don't make money. So I put the one-time-use idol\n inside the smaller box and I took the clue,\n and it says, \"Follow the map\nto the driftwood. \"Break open the driftwood\nto find the key that unlocks the box.\" So, I realize I have\n to hide this box somewhere and figure out what the next step\nof the equation is. That did not sound that great. (sighs) I don't even know\nwhat's happening up there. I couldn't even possibly guess\nwhat he was doing up in the rock mountains? GABE:\n I am just panicking\n and-and panicking. My heart rate is pounding. I had a rough start\n to this game. I sit here with no vote,\n no idol, a whole task to do. It's gonna be a very mentally stressful\nnext couple days. \u266a \u266a Where am I needed? -Vining?\n-RACHEL: There's a ton\non the floor there. And there's, like,\nthat one back there. SAM: I love Vine. RACHEL: Mm. Oh, my God! I was just wondering\n'cause you... Vine was awesome. That's right.\nI was still a young person. JON: Looking at my tribe,\n I'm realizing I'm not getting to know\na group of people. I'm getting to know\na group of young people. I am 41 years old. Okay, so I'm old now? No, I really like Vine.\nI like... There's so much\n \"back in my day\" stuff coming out of my mouth. But, being a speechwriter,\n I learned that you need to be able\n to put yourself in other people's shoes. I'm addicted to TikTok. -It's so good.\n-I am, too. SAM:\nAll the boomers are like,\n\"We got to ban TikTok.\" And I'm just like,\n\"I need my videos of, like, dogs getting adopted.\" JON:\n I'm realizing that\n I'm the oldest person here, but I'm not gonna\n let that stop me from trying to build things with these people. We're doing great. -We're doing amazing.\n-Yeah. Also, I learned this thing I read. My stepdad\nwas like, \"You're gonna die out there.\" He gave me,\nlike, this survivor book for Christmas,\nand if you hold your fingers up to the bottom of the sun, -every finger's 15 minutes.\n-SAM: I read that. -I read that.\n-Oh. -Oh.\n-JON: You read that?\n-SAM: Yeah. A book or a website? A book.\nMine was a book. -SAM: It was on the Internet.\n-It was hard copy. ANDY:\n I first saw Rachel, and I just knew she was someone that\nI wanted to hitch my wagon to. I feel like\nwe've got, like, two hours. Okay. All right. ANDY:\n Right now, I feel like\n I trust Jon and I'm working with Jon,\n but that's it. And that makes me uncomfortable,\n as a numbers guy. Yeah. Let's go. So I really put it upon myself\nto find an opportunity to get a moment with Rachel. That's awesome.\nI feel good about you, too. We're... in alignment.\nWe're synchronized. I agree. I'm like,\n\"You're strong. I'm strong.\" -Yeah. Yeah.\n-I feel like it's good. Part of the appeal\n of Survivor to me is that I love games, and Andy is just the sweetest, but I don't think\n he's strategic. -...in a minute. -RACHEL: He just, like, is a little too eager, maybe, to, like, just to bond and to get to know each other. You have to be careful, though. -Maybe not tomorrow.\n-Yeah, yeah. -I'll follow your lead.\n-Okay. RACHEL:\n It's super suspicious to get up early\nand meet on the beach to talk. Like, absolutely not.\nI am not doing that, Andy. ANDY:\n I couldn't sleep. I wasn't sleeping at all. I was just in these sort of\n negative thoughts, feeling like, in this\n new community, I'm somewhere where I don't belong. And I just needed\n to talk with someone, someone I felt good about\n because I feel like... I am spiraling, in a way. -It's just that I...\n-No, like, you don't\neven need to say. Like, someone definitely knows\nwe're here, -and so, like, that, actually...\n-Yeah, you're so right. RACHEL:\n One of the things\n a Survivor player shouldn't do is go off to talk.\n This is really obvious. People just heard us\n in the shelter. All right,\ndo you want to sit or what? RACHEL:\n And I just literally told him, \"That's a bad idea.\nWe shouldn't do that.\" And then he does it anyway. It doesn't make me more confident that he's going\nto be a good alliance member. ANDY:\nI just can't sleep. -I just need to talk.\n-No, no, you're fine. -No, tell me.\n-I thought I would come in here and be a little different\nthan I am. RACHEL:\nWhat did you think\nyou were gonna be? I thought I was gonna\nbe the version of myself that, like, I feel like I am today, but -feel like I'm going\na little bit backwards.\n-Yeah. He's feeling insecure, and I totally empathized\n with him, but you can't take those moments\n of downness and then just kind of rip\nsomebody else's ga... game and pull them down with you. -We need to get the fire going?\n-ANDY: Yeah. RACHEL:\nMake coconuts first, then fire, -'cause we need to eat.\n-Right. ANDY:\n Rachel's someone\nI felt so good about on day one. -Thank you for doing this.\n-Of course. ANDY:\n But I tried opening up\n to Rachel. I thought that would give me a sense of relief, but I don't feel like\n I got that closure at all. And that put me\n in a very difficult and negative headspace. ANDY:\nRight now. I feel like I've felt very often in my past. RACHEL:\nYeah! ANDY:\n Sort of a high school feeling, like I'm different,\n I stick out in a bad way with a group of people all enjoying\n each other's company... RACHEL:\nYou're so accurate.\nThat's really hard to do. -ALL: Oh!\n-That's a good-ass coconut. ANDY:\n ...without me. -SIERRA: Yes! Give me some.\n-That was beautiful. ANDY:\n When I'm cracking my coconut, people aren't even watching me. Jon-- he cracks a coconut and there are cheers\n from everyone else at camp. And I had this gut feeling I am on the bottom. This could be my last day\nplaying Survivor. -JON: It could be any of us.\n-I'm going crazy. I'm the least popular\non this tribe, and it's okay. It's okay. JON:\n I feel like I'm in a really\n good place with Andy, but there's some anxiety\nunder there, beneath the surface, and that makes me nervous. I don't know if I want\nto work with somebody like that. Th e tr ut h ab ou t DI Y is you never really do it\n all by yourself. Because this setup took\n2 videos, and a quick demo. You can change\nyour color here. And all of this, started here,\ndetoured here, and ended... down here. And this pizza\nwasn't delivery. This was. I wonder if they have...\nthey do have it! We do.

You're in good hands\n with Allstate. \u266a \u266a GABE: The next clue told me I have to go find a piece\n of driftwood out on the beach that has a key inside of it that\nwill open up the second box that will then give me\n the three Tribal idol. And the clock is ticking. So the X on the map\n says it's into the brush, and lo and behold, there's\n a piece of driftwood there. I know that there's\n a key inside of it, so, I just smash it\n like I'm Donkey Kong. (groans softly) Every slam of this driftwood-- it's deeper than\n just getting this key. This is giving my vote back. Who knows how much time I have\n before people get up, and I don't know if I'm gonna\n have another opportunity to keep looking for this thing. Come on. Oh. Come on! (sighs) Bingo. So, now that I finally have this key in my possession, I'm exhausted, but I can't wait to get back to the box. (sighs) There's a catch.\n There's a third box within the second box. It never seems to end. Leave it to Survivor to just not let me\ntake a breath. This was a tough call\n I was making, but this has been so damn hard. I'm really excited\n because I have power again. I have my vote back. I'm a dragon sitting on top\nof a pile of gold. -Personally love him.\n-Yeah, personally love him. -Yeah, I hear you.\n-Yeah, truly. SOL:\n I-I really think\n he has something. Last night, I dug up a box. There was a gigantic lock\n on the box, and then I found the scroll, and I knew there was no way\n I was gonna be able to read the scroll\n in the pitch black. And so, today,\n I walked away by myself so I can read this advantage\nand do the next step. \"Soak... soak the drift...\" That's so random.\nOkay. All right.\nI can do this, though. Once I got that second clue, I realized, \"Okay,\n this is absolutely insane.\" But, man, if I can find this\nand get this done fast, that'll be awesome. All of a sudden,\n I heard a twig snap. I look up,\nand Aysha's right there. Hey. Huh? ROME:\n Granted, I don't think\n she saw me pouring water on the driftwood, but she saw me\nlooking really, really hard. -And...\n-Like, fully, like... -Fully looking.\n-Okay. Where was he looking? AYSHA:\nBy the rocks. We need to see\nif he's still over there. Rome is playing amateur hour. He's searching for idols,\n and he's a complete liability. Rome is off his rocker. (whispering):\nYes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. The key to the box \"is at the bottom of the well.\" When I read that,\nmy heart dropped. (grunts) It feels so, so difficult. You can almost feel like\n Jeff wants someone else to be able to know,\n he wants someone to catch me. I got the key. I know\n that the key unlocks the box. I'm hoping that\nI can go open this box up and that there's gonna be an\nimmunity idol right inside it. (quietly):\nHere we go. What? AYSHA:\n Me, Teeny, Kishan\n and Sol saw Rome at the water well. And he goes the other way. No, \"Hi.\" No,\n\"Hey, what are y'all doing?\" Like, that is just\n suspicious behavior. -Yeah.\n-Should we just keep going? TEENY: Mm. Yeah. AYSHA:\n I have this huge fear of Rome having an idol. I think that's great. AYSHA:\n But now I feel like I have the numbers. If we do end up\nat the first Tribal Council, Rome is the first person\nI want to go. Do y ou r eq ui re s he lt er ? Your inefficient participation\nwill slow the process.

Everybody's in the water. You got to swim out\nto your boat, get everybody on the boat. The boat can't move\nwithout everybody on it. Pull. PROBST:\nOnce everybody's on, you unclip in the front.

PROBST:\nSo, Andy, you haven't even -gone back to camp\nto strategize,\n-ANDY: No. much less get to Tribal, -where all kinds\nof things happen.\n-No. PROBST:\nAnd it sounds like\nyou're conceding defeat. No, no, no, no.\nI'm a strategist. I was gonna try everything. My best friend out here is Jon. And as they were\nfinishing the puzzle, I was... ...thinking I was gonna throw him under the bus\nto try to stay. Just, I just want\nto play the game. -(quiet murmuring)\n-Um... -(quietly): Wow.\n-ANDY: And then, I, like, uh, stopped seeing straight.\n(chuckles) And I just want to,\nyou know, be in the game. PROBST:\nSo, Andy, what's great\nabout Survivor-- you might be right. It might be\na five-O vote tonight. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: You might be wrong. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: You don't know. You fight until\nI snuff your torch. That goes for everybody. You're all gonna feel down.\nHe's just the first. This is why you're out here. You want something soft,\npick another show, 'cause you are on Survivor. That's a badge of honor, -Andy.\n-(Sue whoops) Yeah. Go, Andy. PROBST:\nAll right,\nlet's get to the results, 'cause there is some\npositivity out here, starting with Lavo\nin the middle. Congratulations. -Yes.\n-(whooping) CAROLINE:\nGood job, guys. PROBST:\nYou are safe tonight. Waiting for you back at camp--\nthat nice Survivor tool kit, which will improve\nyour living conditions. -Yes, sir.\n-CAROLINE: Good job, guys. Tuku, it took some work,\nbut you got it. That's all that matters. -You're safe.\n-That's all of us.\nThis is all of us. This is all of us. Waiting for you back at camp--\na smaller tool kit. Tuka, Lavo, grab your stuff. Head out.\nEnjoy the night off. Congratulations. -There he is.\n-PROBST: Lavo, before you leave, -you get your flint.\n-(cheering) We got fire tonight, baby!\nLet's go. Come on. PROBST:\nAll right, so, Gata. What is happening right now? Jon, can you give\nany perspective? How does Andy's confession impact anything? JON:\nUh, what I take from Andy-- uh, previewing a trip for me under a bus-- is... is that he is wrestling with the fact\nthat he wants to stay and he values\nthe relationships he's building. But he knows that\nin a situation like this, you may have to turn\non people you care about. PROBST:\nAll right, Gata,\nTribal Council tonight. Somebody from Gata\nwill be the first person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing--\nsorry for you-- I'm gonna take your flint. Thank you, Rachel. You'll have a chance to win\nit back in the next challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See\nyou tonight at Tribal Council. Thanks, Jeff. ANDY:\n I was being very honest\n in a vulnerable moment at the exact wrong time. I feel like\n I am a dead man walking. But... I'm here because I... will give it my everything. And I have to play\n until my torch is snuffed. The last thing I'm ever gonna do\n is concede. \u266a \u266a If y ou h av e We t AM D, you never want to lose sight\nof the things you love.

I just felt like I was alone\non a planet with a monster. \u266a\u266a I was 12 when he\nimpregnated me. I just remember thinking\nI have to get out of my skin. I can't be me right now,\nthis can't be it. I didn't know what to do. I was a child. I didn't know what it meant\nto be pregnant, at all. But I had options. Because Donald Trump\noverturned Roe v.Wade, girls and women\nall over the country have lost the right to choose, even for rape or incest. \u266a\u266a Donald Trump did this.

Is this actually happening?\" In all of my Survivor watching,\n I don't think that's ever happened before.\n I mean, people have had meltdowns, but I don't think\n it's ever happened in front of everybody else. RACHEL:\n The other tribes-- their jaws were like... \"What?\" And, I mean, so was mine. ANDY:\nOn the mat, I was at 80%. But I've fully\ngathered my thoughts now. Survivor is a game of paranoia. It's extremely possible that\nI was just susceptible to it. I realize now,\nin many ways, how unfair some of the things\nthat I said... Some of the things that\nhave always plagued me have just started\nbubbling up insecurities that date back decades, right? ANIKA:\n He said he was 80%.\n He wasn't 100% better yet. Which makes me nervous. All of us aren't\ngonna be 100% out here. That's the whole entire point\n of the game. If you're gonna have outbursts\n like this on day three-- like, that is a huge concern. I like all of you a lot. And so... -I appreciate that.\n-RACHEL (laughs): Yes. SIERRA:\nAnd, Andy, know how much you contributed to this tribe. You've done beyond\nthe coconut cutting. -The bamboo, our shelter\nwhere we're sleeping,\n-And challenges. challenges, your strength.\nYou provided... -ANIKA: Such an asset.\n-such an asset. JON:\n Andy is messy. That was messy. I don't know that I've seen\nsomething like that before. And because of how\n it all went down, like, you would think that\n they're going for Andy, but I'm a little bit paranoid\n because I feel like I have been\n struggling to fit in, and that makes me nervous. So I'm gonna go feel it out. ANIKA:\nDo you want to talk about Andy? JON:\nYeah. I'm a little frustrated because, like... -He called you out.\n-I know.\n-He called me out. And it's like, \"Hey, man, \"like, we've-we've been\ntalking for two days. I genuinely, really like you.\" This is somebody that I was,\nlike, beginning to think, like, \"Oh, this is a person\nthat could play with. -I could play with them.\" Right?\n-SIERRA: Mm-hmm.\n-Right. You know, like...\nAnd then instead, it's like, -how do I go to bat\nfor you right now?\n-Mm-hmm. -SIERRA: I know. I understand.\n-How do you\nplay a game with him? It stinks. -RACHEL: This stinks.\n-It just stinks. It... So, like,\nI think we need to, like, tell him it's you. Is that okay?\nCause I just don't know that he's gonna believe anything else\nbecause he already is the one that's pitted himself\nagainst you. Okay. -I mean, right?\n-I know, that's true. JON:\n Anika, Rachel and Sierra are all saying it's Andy, but they all immediately\nare like, \"And we're gonna tell Andy it's me,\" which sucks. Uh... SIERRA:\n Bring it in. We got to get to the end here. What I'm hearing\n doesn't totally make sense, so I'd much rather\n try to figure out my best strategic option with the votes. JON: I... -know that, like,\nyou had, like, a moment.\n-ANDY: Yeah. -I want you to stay.\n-I want to stay.\nI want to stay, too. -I want you to stay.\n-And I never was gonna\nthrow you under the bus. -Okay.\n-And that's my... But what do you want to do? Anika. Anika is the person I want gone. -Okay.\n-How do you feel about that? I... I would like to do it. ANDY:\nI'm patching things up with Jon, and he gives me sort of, like,\n a lifeline for me in this game to get out a person\n I actually want out, which is Anika. At this point, my main, core priority\nover everything is just fighting to stay in the game. JON: If we can turn this into\na move, I think we can turn... -Yeah. Yeah.\n-like, you having that moment\non the mat -Yeah.\n-into something. I think that Sam has a working line of communication\nwith Sierra. All right, let's go talk to Sam. Right now, it's either\n me or Andy. Or I can try to vote Anika. If I'm gonna be on this show\nfor one episode-- one glorious\nand perfect episode-- I'd rather go out swinging\nand ha-- and-and making\nsome kind of a move rather than just\nhoping for the best. I don't want\nto hope for the best. I want to try\nto figure something out. -Here's where we're at.\nIt's you, it's me or it's\n-ANDY: Yeah. -Okay.\n-Anika. For tribe strength, what is Anika offering, right? I think you, me and Andy\nvote Anika -and pull someone\n into the group.\n -SAM: Yeah. Yes. Well, I mean, that\n would be our option there. JON:\n I think Sierra\n will listen to you, and I think we have to just sort\nof not talk to Rachel about it. -Right?\n-N-- Yes. JON:\nI just also, like... Hi. Don't worry,\njust going to the water well. You guys can keep going. SAM:\nJon and Andy expect me to throw a vote on Anika tonight. Love you, Jon,\n but I'm not doing that. I'm starting to think Jon is playing hard. -JON: We can make this work.\n-SAM: Yes. -I got it, right?\n-Okay. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go. He's a strategist. He's very, very smart,\n which is dangerous for me. And Andy is strong. He might be able to help us win a challenge or two. ANIKA:\nI know we're at a point in the\ngame where we need strength, but will we actually\nwin more with Andy? Because he is messy and not only\nin his words, but, like, -all he is is brute force,\nand it's not even\n-SIERRA: That's so true. -that strong a force. -SIERRA: Having somebody like Andy can be a liability, and it's somebody we definitely\n need to worry about. However, I think\n right now we need strength. I don't think these challenges\n are going to get any easier. We need some strength\nand, honestly, we're not getting that from Jon. I think we need to touch base\nand get on the same page. -Yep.\n-Yeah.\n-SIERRA: We have to be quick. We need strength right now. I think that makes sense.\nRight now, I would vote Jon. RACHEL:\nI still really worry about Andy imploding again.\nLike, yesterday was a bad day, today's a bad day. He's given up\nhalfway through the challenge -before we even lost.\n-ANIKA: Mm-hmm. I just think there's legitimate\npros and cons to both. If we keep Andy, I think he's more loyal\n to me than he is to anybody else on our tribe. But I don't know that\n that's actually a good thing because Andy is a ticking\n time bomb and you don't know when it's gonna explode. On the other hand, if we keep Jon, who is\nmore even keel and levelheaded, we might lose the next\n few immunity challenges without Andy's strengths. I am genuinely torn. Our ability as a tribe to make the right choice\n is gonna decide the fate of Gata,\n and that is so scary. \u266a \u266a If y ou ' re l iv in g wi th H IV , imagine being good to go\n without daily HIV pills.

This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council\nbecause in this game, fire represents your life. Fire's gone, so are you. And that will be the case\nfor one of you tonight. But before we get to the vote, we got a lot to talk about. It has been a roller coaster for the Gata tribe. Sierra, give me an idea -of camp life.\n-Oh, my God, Jeff. I mean, my back\nfeels broken, my legs feel broken, I have bruises,\nand it's been three days.\nI mean, Jeff, I have the Survivor 101 book at home.\nI have 25 coconuts in my backyard,\nmachetes. My neighbors definitely\nhave a lot of questions about who's living next door to them. But I do have to give props\nto Anika. I mean, she definitely led the tribe\nfor a good bit. She had the basics and got us, like,\na good base start. PROBST:\nAnika, walk me through that. How did you step up\nto be the leader? So, I'm flattered\nthat you think that. Um, I had general consensus\nand a general idea of what we should be doing,\nrealistically. -How would you\ndescribe camp, Jon?\n-JON: I think we spent the first three days finding commonality. You're doing that\nbecause you genuinely want to. There are genuine connections, those are real,\nyou can't fake it. And even if you wanted to,\nI don't think you ultimately could succeed unless you were,\nlike, a sociopath. And so, yes, we're a community,\nbut we're also competitors. And I think a little bit\nout of fear and trepidation, people really were reluctant\nto break out into groups and start\nhaving strategic conversations. So, a bit of a delayed start\nto the strategy part? Uh... yes. PROBST:\nAll right, let's get\ninto the emotional part of the first three days, Andy, -all circling around you.\n-Yeah. Today at the immunity challenge, what stood out to me were the comments you made\nabout your tribe. -Yeah.\n-\"Nobody noticed me\nopen a coconut. Nobody likes me.\nEverybody wants me gone.\" Walk me through that\na little more. Well, I feel like I grew up on the outside, 100%. I never felt like I belonged, but coming into this experience, I felt like I changed just by getting rid of all this, like, need to please people. PROBST:\nSo, you're saying,\nin your recent life, -Yeah.\n-just back home, you felt like you've broken out\nof that feeling left out. -Yeah.\n-And do you feel like\nyou have a community? An unbelievable community\nhas formed around me, and it did not happen overnight. It was because\nI challenged myself. I kept saying yes to things. I kept putting myself\nout of my comfort zone, and succeed or fail\nbased off of that. PROBST:\nSo, it's fascinating -that you would work so hard\n-ANDY: Yeah. and then sign up\nto take on the biggest test -Yeah.\n-of social resiliency anybody could\never volunteer for. ANDY:\nBut I've made myself\nready to conquer that. And now I can go show,\nyou know, the world, any-- everyone in my life,\nyou know, how far I've come and how, you know,\neasy it will be for me now, which is not the case,\nas we can see. PROBST:\nSo, Jon, regardless\nhow it played out today, do you respect the fact\nthat Andy's intention of coming out here was to try\nto take on this social test? Um, did Andy have a moment? People have moments. Sometimes they happen\non a beach in Fiji. People shouldn't be judged\nby their worst moments, even if you are frustrated\nthat they're saying it -in front of everyone,\nincluding Jeff.\n-(laughs): Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.\n-JON: So I don't think\nany of us came away from that not being frustrated. PROBST:\nSo, let's talk about that. Andy, you shared\na lot of information. -Yeah.\n-It'd be very easy to say, -\"He's a loose cannon.\nYou got to get rid of him.\"\n-Yeah. PROBST:\nSo, when you get back to camp, -what did you do?\n-I want to be very, very clear, and I was clear to everyone. I think it was pretty obvious that there was absolutely\nzero premeditation. That old part of me just set in\nand that paranoia, and now look\nat these five people who Andy threw under the bus. -You only threw one person\nunder of the bus.\n-Well, yeah. With my words.\nYeah. But despite all this, the one thing\nI absolutely cannot do is say that it's okay\nto vote me out. Let's just play Survivor. I will accept the result. So, Sam, what was the fallout from a strategic point of view? Because you don't want to come\nback to Tribal Council again, and a lot of that is gonna\nbe harmony and tribe strength. I never had a perception of Andy that he was out here to do\nanything other than give 100%. He fought so hard\nin the challenge that he's passed out\non the side. But then he's willing\nto turn on his best friend. Well, that's hard for somebody\nto jump into bed with. Rachel, can Andy\nrecover from today? I-I... I empathize with\nAndy completely, but what if he goes\non a journey and says whatever he's thinking,\nwhich-- who knows-- you know, what plans\nhe has that I don't know about. But Survivor does that to you. Like, everyone has\nthose moments of like, \"Is everybody just\nlying to me right now?\" PROBST:\nJon, it's interesting that playing out right now\nis everything we talked about\nat the marooning. The idea of building\na new community where you can feel safe in it, but then you put on top of it\nthe game. So, how confident are you\nabout the vote? I don't know\nwhat kind of conversations would have taken place\nif Andy hadn't drawn the... the evil eye.\nI-I really don't know. But when you know that there's all these different\nconversations going on and that there is\na natural target, it really starts\nto make you wonder, who's the unnatural target? Could I be trying\nto find that person? Could it be me? \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAll right. It is time to vote.\nSierra, you're up. \u266a \u266a Oh, my God.\n(laughs softly) I'll go tally the votes. \u266a \u266a If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Jon. Anika.\nOne vote Jon, one vote Anika. Jon. That's two votes Jon,\none vote Anika. Jon.\nThree votes Jon. First person voted out\nof Survivor 47: Jon. That's four. That's enough.\nNeed to bring me your torch. JON:\nAll right. Jon, the tribe has spoken. (chuckles)\nTime for you to go. All right. -See you.\n-JON: Bye, team.\n-Bye, Jon. Good job.

All right, Bhanu,\nwhen you're ready. The tribe has spoken. \u266a \u266a -KENZIE: The tiniest tribe\nthere ever was.\n-I know. KENZIE:\nThat was an interesting Tribal. KENZIE: Yeah. I'm happy\nhe told us his story, though.

But, uh, anytime you suffer is another opportunity to learn\nthe depths of your mind. Ooh! Ooh. -You okay, Ben?\n-Major, like, spins. CHARLIE:\nDo you need a water refill? BEN:\nYeah, if you could.\nThank you, buddy. I'm really thankful for Charlie, and he's looking out for me,\n but, like, you know, I have had\nsome survival experiences. You ever been stuck in a van\nwith the same six people for two months surviving off\nthree dollars at Taco Bell a day? It is not easy. Sir Ben. BEN:\nSir Charles, lead the way. Onward. We go to war. MORIAH:\nFeel like Ben's been making an extra effort to hang around\nonly Charlie recently. He has. I've seen that. MARIA: I think\nthey're trying to make... MARIA:\nThe thing is that they did not -calculate that\nwe got to him first.\n-JEM: Yeah. MORIAH:\nBut, I mean, this\nisn't a game of \"dids.\" -MARIA: No, it's not.\n-MORIAH: It's a game\nof Survivor. I do trust, you know,\n Jem, Maria and Charlie. Where I worry is, Ben\nand Charlie chatting, and Ben is the most charismatic\nand likable, enjoyable guy\nI have ever met in my life. People on our tribe just know\nhow awesome you are, you know? They know how awesome... \u266a you are. \u266a MORIAH:\n It seem Charlie's\n Ben's, like, special buddy, especially when they're just,\n like, going on hour-long music, song battles. -\"Danger.\"\n-\"The Last Great\nAmerican Dynasty.\" -\"I Love It Loud.\"\n-\"Peace.\" -\"Killer.\"\n-\"Hoax.\" -\"I Still Love You.\"\n-\"Mad Woman.\" MORIAH:\n Ben can charm anyone. It's a little bit intimidating. You can't just say,\n\"my alliance member.\" People change.\nPeople make their own decisions. So, if you had to choose,\nwho would be first to go? In the long run, like,\nwho's more dangerous? -JEM: Yeah.\n-MORIAH: But... What if Tim has the idol? MARIA:\nAre we just assuming\nTim has the idol? MORIAH:\nTim or Ben. -I'm assuming\none of the two has it.\n-JEM: I agree. The girls think that\n one of the guys might have\n the immunity idol, but I found a Beware Advantage, and it's a clue to the idol. And nobody suspects\n that I have anything on me because I put the Beware\n Advantage in another tree to kind of get the scent off of,\nthat somebody already found something. Where's the damn scroll? JEM:\n It's been\na wild goose chase, and finally, everybody knows\n there's nothing there. And that played out\n to my advantage, because now the women\n are on the same page. Either Ben or Tim\nare gonna be the next target for us, and then the three girls\n are running the show. This is a beautiful place\nto have a salsa lesson, though. ALL:\nFive, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, pause. Five, six, seven, pause. I want to see Charlie\nget the hips going. Oh, Charlie! (laughing) BEN:\nCha-cha Charlie, dude. CHARLIE:\n It's amazing. I thought it would take a few, you know,\ndirty Shirley Temples to get me in that type of mood. But out on Survivor, you're just having so much fun\n with each other. BEN:\nYeah, let's go. Bite that lip. (laughing) ALL:\nFour, five, six, seven. Pause. (laughing) CHARLIE: You know,\n the salsa may seem goofy, but it's all\npart of the strategy, if you think about it, you know. It's going to be very important\nfor me to really be in lockstep with my number one ally, Maria. And so, let's switch partners. CHARLIE: We're trying\n to walk the tightrope of the middle of this tribe,\n and you've got Tim and Ben on one side\nand Jem and Moriah on the other. So Maria and I\n are really in control. I don't think anyone knows we're really working\n closely together, and that's so powerful,\nso I want to keep it that way. (all cheering) LIZ: If everybody's looking,\n I guess maybe I should look. Just got a feeling\nthat I'm not gonna find it. There's just so many\nnooks and crannies to scour. -Mm.\n-While we're here... HUNTER: At this point, getting so close to the merge, everyone's worried\nabout the idol. Everybody's searching\n for this thing. Soda is very blatantly\n looking around. Tevin's out there\n with the shovel, digging. You get that little surge\nof excitement when you see something,\nand then... (blows raspberries)\n...nothing. I have spent so much time\n looking for this idol. I've been digging\n and climbing and, like, going all over the place. I feel like I'm walking by it, and, you know,\n the camera pans to it, and ping, there it is,\n but you don't see it. This jungle is so huge, and there are\n so many small crevices. I want to find the thing, but\n it's just like, \"Where is it?\" TEVIN:\n I don't know what the hell\n going on with the idol. I don't know\n if there's more than one, if there's two, if there's\n three, if there's none. So I don't know\nwhere to even look. And no one seems\n to have found it. I think every person has looked\n for the idol except Liz. LIZ:\nI'm just sitting at the shelter. I keep telling people,\n \"I'm not gonna look.\" I'm not gonna\nsearch for an idol. I can barely find my shoes. SODA:\n Looking for an idol\n is just so difficult. It is so dense out here. It's almost impossible to scour every little inch. There may be one coconut\n you don't turn over, but there's, like,\n a million coconuts. It's exhausting. And at the same time, we don't want it to fall\ninto the wrong hands. VENUS:\nWhat is that man looking for? I'm gonna go spoil his fun. An idol. In my mind, it's day ten, and I'm pretty sure\nthat sucker is found. And I guess I was wrong\nin assuming you found it. This advantage has really weighed on my mind\nbecause I know Randen found it. And he was medevaced\n with that Beware Advantage in his pocket, so, it's probably\n back in the game. Hunter knows this island\n better than anyone, so, Hunter,\n if you're finding that idol, I will find it with you. I-I'm shameless.\nI will literally follow you. And if I'm annoying you,\nI don't care. It would be near a landmark, no? I don't know. I mean, in\nthe other season, it was, like, tied to the top of a bush,\nand then, in, like, those little cracks\nof those things. And so, I think the era\nof the landmark has kind of, like, passed. Yeah. HUNTER:\nVenus keeps following me around as I'm looking for an idol. So, I automatically\n just sit down and stop searching. I don't want her\n to know if I find it. Realistically, Hunter, if we do\ngo into any kind of merge, we have to pick out\nwho the biggest threat is. People might be thinking you. Okay, but you don't think that? No, I do, but I... So you want\nto vote me out today? I don't because\nI consider you a meat shield. HUNTER:\n Come on, man. I know that\n I am a huge challenge threat. That's why I'm looking\n for idols and stuff. I wish she would just\nleave me alone. Can you believe\nwe're halfway through and we haven't even\nstarted playing? -It's unheard of.\n-It's pretty fun. Thank you. -I'm rooting for you.\n-I'm rooting for us, for Nami. After our really cagey, awkward conversation, Venus finally decides\nto leave me alone. And then I can get back\nto really looking. So much time spent looking\nfor this stupid thing. And then I see it--\n the Beware Advantage. It's about time. Oh, golly. Forget that.\nWe're looking at it. I know being the biggest\n challenge threat is making a target on my back. So I snatched that thing up\nas fast as I could. \"Dig directly below the spot where you found\nthe Beware Advantage.\" Well, I started digging,\n and I find a big old box, and the box has a lock on it, but there's a little scroll\n on it. And it says, \"There is a hidden\nimmunity idol in this box, but the box requires a key\nto open it.\" Oh, boy. \"The location of the key\n will remain a mystery \"until after your tribe loses\n a future immunity challenge. \"Once your tribe loses, \"return to this location\nto receive further instructions. \"Until you have taken possession\nof the idol, you cannot vote\nat Tribal Council.\" I do want to have this idol, but now I have to wait\n until my tribe loses? Looking at the performance\nof the other tribes, it doesn't look like\nit's gonna happen very soon. Thankfully, there's a clause\n that says if we don't lose, I still have an opportunity\n to get it. I know that I am in trouble\nif the merge hits. I know that I need\n as many weapons and tools as I can have\n going into it, and so, this could be\ngame-changing for me.

And sleeping on the bamboo,\n sitting on the bamboo, hell, even looking\nat the bamboo at this point-- it's getting on my nerves. Q:\nNo tree mail. TIFFANY:\nI'm sure he's fine. KENZIE:\n We've gone through hell. We're the only tribe,\non day ten, who has even stepped foot\ninto Tribal Council. And for Tiff and I,\n it's almost comical. What will Yanu lose today? (both laughing) KENZIE:\n But we are in a tough spot, and it just seems to be getting\ntougher and tougher. And Q is starting\n to get, like, really down. KENZIE:\nWe can make it. We've, like,\nalready fought so hard, and I don't see\neither one of us, like, stopping anytime soon. -What?\n-I might. -Stop?\n-Say ... (laughs) -KENZIE: Don't say that.\n-Q: I already told you. KENZIE:\nAre you serious about that? -Yeah.\n-Like, you would\njust want to go? It's not giving up.\nIt's accepting. KENZIE:\n This morning, I could tell\n something was off. So now, Q has thrown himself\n on the sword. He's telling us\nhe's ready to go. If someone's saying,\n \"Send me home,\" that's one step closer\nfor me to the end. Let's just win. Q:\n It's tempting\n to just give up and go home, but I would never do that. The reality\n of the situation is this. Regardless of the conditions,\n I'm willing to pass out and die\nbefore I quit. But I don't want Kenzie to know that,\n because if we have to go back to Tribal, I want Kenzie comfortable so she's not gonna play\n her Shot in the Dark. I've been saying it\nthe whole time. I got one number one\nout here, and that's just real. TIFFANY:\nAbsolutely. Q:\nHey, have you noticed, when Kenzie walk up, the first\nthing she always asked is... (laughs)\nYeah, I noticed that. What are y'all talking about? Oh. What are y'all talking about? TIFFANY:\nChopping up wood. What are y'all talking about? TIFFANY:\nCoconuts versus papayas. What are y'all talking about? Q over here telling us\nto write his name down. It would be devastatingly hard if we go to another\n Tribal Council, especially for me, because Kenzie's expecting me to vote Q and Q's expecting me\nto vote Kenzie, which puts me\n in a really tough position. It forces me to have to choose\nbetween my two tightest allies. So I'm praying we don't have to go back\n to Tribal Council so I don't have\n to make that decision. MORIAH: We just need\n to get this fire going. MORIAH: Yeah. Hmm? I don't...\nI don't feel nothing yet. Tiki Man, everybody... everybody\nwant to be in our business. Everybody want to know\nwhat we're talking about. \u266a \u266a I feel fine. I'm getting hungry, but I'm drinking enough. I haven't pooped,\nso I don't know, like, whether or not to be concerned. I'm talking to Tiki Man. Oh. TIM:\n But I feel good nevertheless. You know, it is what it is.\nIt's Survivor. And I'm just trying\nto see it through for my family. TIM:\nSomebody moved\nthe Beware Advantage. I'm trying to figure out who. Somebody lied\nand made me dig three feet. That would be the dickest move\nto make people dig -for three days.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. -And give 'em no...\n-And kill a tree. TIM:\n I have no idea who put it there to play with us.\n These people are nuts. I'm talking about my tribe.\nSiga is nuts. Like, right now,\n we're all suspects. I do feel like I trust Ben. We vibe, we're hanging out. \u266a Brotherly love. \u266a TIM:\n Same for Maria. The parent connection\nis strong for us since the beginning. -And I still feel confident\nin you, Charlie, Ben and I.\n-Yeah. And Charlie. I think\nwe're a really strong four -going forward.\n-Yeah, I think so. TIM: I have a feeling\n about who did it. So I'm excited about\nputting the pieces together. How you moved\nthe Beware Advantage? What Beware Advantage? I don't know about that. -So you don't have an idol?\n-I don't have an idol. Why are you freaking out? I feel... I feel...\nYou're gonna make me upset. I really feel like\nI'm on the bottom. Don't get u...\nNobody's on the bottom. I don't believe her.\n Jem's, like, acted weird. Ugh! I don't like it.\nI do not like it. Somebody moved\nthat Beware Advantage, yo. I think so, too. TIM:\n I'm not-I'm not sure,\n but I think she's fooling me\nand everybody else. You and Mo not tight?\nSo who you tight with? Just me? -I hon... Can I be honest?\n-Yeah. I don't feel like I have, like,\na very tight relationship with anybody, so I don't know\nwhat's going on in your head. Tim's coming at me\n so hard for information, but I'm a fantastic liar.\nI just found it out. 'Cause usually,\n at home when I lie, I giggle. And, like,\n my husband knows when I lie. But I haven't giggled at all.\nLike, I just lied. What are you thinking...\nif you had to vote? We are. Bros are tight. Ben and Tim think\n they're running the show, but the girls have control,\n which is great, 'cause when\n you're playing this game, it's either you or them,\nand that's how I see it. So it's either me or Ben or Tim and so,\n it's better them than me. Wh en i t co me s to h ai r su pp le me nt s, you just never know.

Hello, Jeff. Oh, my God. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nGetting your first look\nat the new Yanu tribe. Bhanu voted out\nat the last Tribal Council. All right, shall we get\nto today's immunity challenge? -Yes.\n-(all voicing assent)\n-PROBST: First things first. Got to take back the idols. Thank you, Moriah. Tevin, come on, give it up. -Jeff, please.\n-Don't make me take it. -(Tevin laughs)\n-Scary. Once again... immunity is back up for grabs. TEVIN:\nAll right. PROBST:\nFor today's challenge, one at a time,\n you're gonna race through a massive,\n three-level obstacle course, collecting keys along the way. Once everybody's at the finish,\n one person will use those keys to unlock a long hook. You'll use the hook\n to release sandbags. You will then race to fire those\nsandbags at a series of targets. First two tribes to finish win immunity,\nsafe from the vote. In addition,\nplaying for a reward. Want to know what's playing for? -Yes, please, Jeff.\n-(all voicing assent) -SODA: Food.\n-I think you're gonna like it. -SODA: Food.\n-TEVIN: Please. (all cheering) Oh, Jesus Lord, my God. I told you. PROBST:\nPastries and fruit... -TEVIN: My God!\n-SODA: I called it. PROBST:\n...for the first tribe\nto finish. For the second tribe to finish,\na smaller sampling -of the same thing.\n-TEVIN: That's all good. (applause) (indistinct chatter) Last tribe to finish,\notherwise known as? ALL:\nThe losers. I thought they might say Yanu. (all groaning) -Jeff, come on!\n-That's crazy, Jeff. -Jeff, don't be dirty.\n-TIFFANY: That's crazy. Wow.\n-Shady. -I'm just saying.\n-You're so sassy. PROBST: Last tribe to finish,\nTribal Council where somebody will be the fifth\nperson voted out of this game, and as a penalty for losing,\nI will keep your flint. Yanu, you are still working\nto earn yours. And I would like\nto take a moment, because we love records\non Survivor. Yanu, you have endured longer\nthan any tribe in the new era without your flint-- 11 days. That is a record. And if you lose this challenge, you will hold another record. The most immunity losses in a season in the new era. Wow. PROBST:\nIf that's not inspiration, I got nothing for you.\nAll right. Let's get to sit-outs. Nami, sitting two people out. Cannot sit out\nin back-to-back challenges. Tevin must compete.\nWho's it gonna be? I'll sit out. PROBST:\nSoda and Liz gonna sit out. All right, Siga,\nJem and Maria must participate. Who are you gonna pick to join? -It's gonna be Tim.\nPROBST: Tim. So Moriah, Charlie and Ben\ngonna be the sit-outs. All right, sit-outs, take a spot\non the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize.\nWe'll get it on. Let's go, Yanu! \u266a \u266a All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? -Go!\n-SODA: Let's go, Nami! Kenzie, Tim\nand Hunter out first. SODA:\nLet's go, Nami! PROBST:\nA massive obstacle course.\nYou've got to collect three keys in order. One, two, then three. CHARLIE:\nLet's go, Siga! PROBST:\nTim has the first bag for Siga. (Ben whoops) -Tim of the jungle!\n-(whooping) Hunter has the first bag\nfor Nami. -Let's go, baby!\n-(whooping) BEN:\nChallenge war board! PROBST:\nIt is Tim in the lead,\nthen Hunter. Kenzie's got a bag for Yanu. CHARLIE:\nLet's go, Tim! PROBST:\nTim is ripping through this. He doesn't even use the ladder. Tim at the third bag. Hunter's got his second bag. -BEN: Yes, Tim! You're flying!\n-MORIAH: Tim! PROBST:\nTim is across. Go, Siga! Go, Nami! Here comes Maria. -Here comes Tevin.\n-MORIAH: Come on, Maria! -TIFFANY: Come on, Kenz.\n-Oh, my God. TIFFANY:\nCome on, Kenz!\nCome on, Kenz! Let's go! Kenzie falling behind for Yanu. She's got the second bag. -Maria at her first bag.\n-MORIAH: That's it, baby girl! PROBST:\nTevin at his first bag. (cheering):\nLet's go, Tevin! Let's go! PROBST:\nKenzie finally has\nher third bag. -Oh!\n-And falls. Go, Yanu! Here comes Tiff. BEN:\nGo, Maria! Use that leg! PROBST:\nSiga and Nami are side by side. Maria and Tevin, pastries\nand immunity on the line. Tevin has his second bag.\nMaria has hers. Here's Tiff for Yanu. Dead last, a familiar spot. Tevin working\non that third bag. BEN:\nAll right, Maria! Get 'em on the table. -Go, Nami!\n-HUNTER: Let's go, V! Here comes Venus. Maria's got the third bag.\nGo, Siga! -Here comes Jem.\n-CHARLIE: Let's go, Jem. -HUNTER: Let's go, V!\n-SODA: Let's go, V! KENZIE:\nYou got this, Tiffany! PROBST:\nYanu really taking a long time. Tiffany has all three. Go!\nIt's Q on the course now. -HUNTER: There you go, Venus.\n-TEVIN: You got it, V. PROBST:\nThere goes Venus working her way\nto that second bag. My little woman stick bug. -Jem going for the second bag.\n-(overlapping shouting) Q has got a lot\nof time to make up. -KENZIE: You got this, Q!\n-PROBST: He's trying to get Yanu back in this. They have yet to win an immunity\nchallenge this entire season. (indistinct,\noverlapping chatter) -PROBST: Jem has a second bag.\n-TEVIN: Let's go, Venus. -You're good.\n-PROBST: Venus has\nher second bag. KENZIE:\nYou got it, Q! PROBST:\nQ with his first bag. -KENZIE: You got this, Q!\n-BEN: Let's go, Jem! -(whooping)\n-PROBST: Jem has her third. -You're good, baby. Come on.\n-PROBST: You're good, Siga. It's gonna be Tim\nworking the rope. You're good, Nami. It's gonna\nbe Hunter on the rope for Nami. First you got\nto find the three keys and figure out\nwhich one unlocks your hook. TEVIN:\nGood luck, baby. PROBST:\nQ working on that third bag.\nHe's got it. Got to get down. You're good! It's gonna be Q. HUNTER: Is that it?\n-TEVIN: Nothing but luck, baby. PROBST:\nNow Hunter\nhas his hook unlocked. He can start\nworking on the rope. Tim still looking for the key. Here's the opportunity\nfor Yanu to get back in it. And just like that,\nQ has the hook for Yanu. They got a shot. Still looking for\ntheir first taste of victory. You've got to untwist that rope.\nAll of it. TEVIN:\nFew more, baby. -BEN: Let's go, Tim!\n-CHARLIE: You got this, Tim. PROBST:\nTim finally has his hook. It is Q, Tim and Hunter trying to release that rope so they can\nrelease their sandbags. TIFFANY:\nThat's awesome. Yes. (indistinct shouting) Hunter drops for Nami. They can start\ncollecting their sandbags. Tim has the bags undone. You're good, Siga!\nStart collecting those sandbags. -PROBST: Q still working\non that rope.\n-TIFFANY: Same thing. Just reach out further. Come on! PROBST: You got\nto get all your sandbags. -Wow.\n-CHARLIE: Jem, you're so quick.\nLet's go! Once they're all in there,\nyou're good. -You're good.\n-BEN: All right, Maria! PROBST:\nHere goes Tevin. The massive Survivor slingshot. Looking for three targets\nto knock down. SODA:\nSo proud of you. You got this. Just misses! LIZ:\nCome on. Try again. Q still working on the rope. Yanu is dead last again, which is a common story. -LIZ: There you go.\n-Tevin again. Knocks down the first target\nfor Nami! Everybody's got\nto hit one target. TIM:\nYou got it. Nice shot. PROBST:\nThere goes Maria.\nShe misses. It's Venus now for Nami. Venus knocks down a target\nwith her first shot. Nami down to one target left.\nIt's Hunter. Maybe give yourself\na little slack. PROBST:\nQ has released his sandbags! You're good, Yanu!\nLet's go! -VENUS: Hunter, you got this!\n-SODA: You got this, Hunter. TEVIN:\nYou got it, Hunter.\nRight here, for the win. PROBST:\nThere it is, for the win! Nami remains undefeated. \u266a Nami, Nami, Nami, Nami. \u266a We're looking for one more. Can Yanu get back in this? Siga has not knocked down\nany targets yet. Here goes Tiff. And she connects.\nYanu has their first target. BEN:\nMaria, you got this! PROBST:\nMaria just misses. -Here comes Q.\n-(overlapping chatter) Jem for Siga. And she does it.\nWe are tied, one-one. PROBST:\nAnybody could win this\nright now, including Yanu. Yanu either gonna\nbreak a losing streak or set a record\nfor the longest losing streak. There goes Kenzie. And she does it! Nami has two!\nMaria hits her second\nright on the heels of Kenzie. And it is a showdown--\nTim versus Q. One target left\nfor both Siga and Yanu. For the win right here. -Tim, no.\n-Okay. -PROBST: Q... no.\n-(contestants groaning) Right there! You're right there! This is the greatest playoffs\nof the century. Both guys quickly reload,\nbut Q is way ahead of Tim. BEN:\nCome on, baby, Celtics, baby! PROBST: There it is! Yanu wins their first immunity challenge\nof the season... Hey. PROBST: ...sending Siga\nto Tribal Council -for the first time.\n-(overlapping chatter) -We did it!\n-Yeah! Ah! And that is what\na victory looks like on day 11 for Yanu. Smiling faces. Fire! Thank you. TIFFANY: Yes. Nami, once again,\ncongratulations. (whooping) -Thank you.\n-Immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Nami. Yanu, for the first time\nthis season, the immunity idol\nis coming to your camp. -Thank you.\n-Along with it, -your flint.\n-(whooping) First time in 11 days. Mwah. -(Kenzie whoops)\n-That should be\na game-changer, Kenzie. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, this is amazing. PROBST:\nLet's just take a moment, since you have been winless. What is that feeling right now, Tiff, to be holding that idol? Honestly... (exhales) it feels so good, but all I can think\nabout right now is that I'm not gonna wake up\nfreezing cold tomorrow. It's been so hard\nsleeping without fire for the last 11 days.\nLike, brutal. I'm just... I'm so happy, Jeff. PROBST:\nKenzie, what's the feeling? It's been a very long\nlosing streak for Yanu. KENZIE:\nThis feeling is new to us. All we really know is losing, and we have lost\nhalf of our tribe. So the fact that\nwe get to keep us together, like some semblance of Yanu\nmoving forward, it's... You know, we were preparing\nfor the worst this morning. We were like, \"What if\nwe have to go down to two?\" Because that's all we knew. So this is just\na little bit of security in a game\nwhere we haven't had any. All right, Nami,\nyou also won reward. Large tray of pastries and fruit will be\nwaiting for you back at camp. Yanu, a smaller tray\nof pastries and fruit will be waiting for you\nback at camp. Siga, different story. Tribal Council tonight, where somebody from your tribe will be the fifth person\nvoted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing,\nyou know what's coming. Sorry for you,\nI'm gonna take your flint. \u266a \u266a All right,\nbefore I send you on your way... journey. -(gasping)\n-Oh. Nami, you are\nin charge of who goes. Just like last time,\none person from your tribe, one person from Siga,\none person from Yanu. Who's going from your tribe? -I'm gonna go.\n-PROBST: Hunter's gonna go. All right, who from Siga\nis gonna go on this journey? Any volunteers? All right, Tim's gonna\ngo on the journey from Siga. And you've got the Yanu three. We're gonna let Q go. PROBST:\nAll right,\nso it's gonna be Hunter, Tim and Q on the journey.\nGrab your stuff, head out. You will return back to camp\nbefore Tribal Council. Nami, grab your stuff, head out. No Tribal Council.\nNobody going home. -Thank you, Jeff.\n-Good job, Nami. -TEVIN: Thank you.\n-SODA: Thank you. Yanu, grab your stuff. I know you won't\nmiss me at Tribal. -Sure won't.\n-PROBST: Head out,\nenjoy the night off and that well-deserved reward. Thanks, Jeff.\nGood luck, y'all. TIFFANY:\nGood luck, guys. All right, Siga,\ngrab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at Tribal. CHARLIE:\n We've been the vibe tribe\n for the whole first 11 days. Thing about vibes is\nthey can go from good to bad, and it's just terrifying. Tonight's our first time\n at Tribal, and everyone's got the feeling of dread all over their body.

I'm feeling the best\nthat I've felt in 11 days. I'm excited, ready and eager to have a bro moment\nat this journey. I couldn't wait. That was a good win, man. -I'm glad\nyou got your flint, man.\n-Yeah. Man. -I'm glad you got your...\nI was pissed we lost, but...\n-But we-we... -we haven't eaten since\nwe got on the beach.\n-Oh, yeah. -Have y'all had a fire yet?\n-No. -I didn't think y'all did.\n-Never. Only thing we've had\nwas one coconut a day. -Wow.\n-TIM: Damn. So we're looking at one more\nvote before a merge, possibly. -If we get to the merge...\n-TIM: Yeah. the physical threats-- it-it's only really three of us. We gonna have to stick together,\nregardless. And the only thing\nthat I can think of is, if you get\none person you trust, -Yeah.\n-I get one person I trust, -you get one person you trust.\n-Mm-hmm. So if we can do that, -we can make it to six,\nand may the best man win.\n-Yeah. What about Tiffany? -Is she with you?\n-Tiff. -Tiff would be my one.\n-Okay. Okay. -I don't know who would be your\none, who would be your one.\n-Okay. -Maybe Jem.\n-Maria's got the extra vote, so I'm using her as my one. She's strong, and we're both... We're the only parents\nover there. -Maria for you\n-Yeah. Tevin. -And Tevin for you.\n-Tevin. -Are we solid on this alliance?\n-Q: I'm solid. -I-I swear to you guys.\n-TIM: I'm solid on this... Q:\n Hunter, myself and Tim are the biggest threats,\nphysically. So we agree that\n the three of us pick one person on our tribe, and let's go to the final six. I think that's a good plan. -Want to read this?\n-TIM: Let's do it. It's a Survivor knowledge test. We have to decide, as a group,\nwho will go do this Survivor knowledge test\n and risk not having a vote. I'm a superfan, and I'm confident in my ability. However, my vote is way too valuable tonight at Tribal Council, so I don't want\n to play the game. Y'all superfans? -I'm a pretty big fan.\n-TIM: Yeah, yeah. Are you-are you a superfan? If you're a pretty big fan,\nI don't know, you might know\nsome more knowledge than I do. -Q: You'll definitely\nknow more than me.\n-Yeah. -I'm comfortable\nwith you going, bro.\n-HUNTER: Okay. -Best of luck, man.\n-We'll see what happens. -Thank you.\n-Good luck, man. HUNTER: The journey is awesome because you have an opportunity\nto meet people and, you know,\n whatever connections you can have, I'll take. And now, if I can get\na big advantage from this, it would be amazing. Oh, boy. Okay. Let's just see what all we got. The journey is an opportunity\n to test my Survivor knowledge. There's this long table, and you've got\n to put 20 Survivor logos in chronological order. I'm a pretty big fan, but when I watched Survivor, my college roommate was the one\nwho introduced it to me. And he just\nshowed 'em to me in order of seasons that he likes,\nnot in chronological order. And so I was like, \"Oh, boy. This is not gonna be easy.\" Well, we know that one. But I recognize Borneo, season one. Boom.\n First one right there. Let's just start\nputting these in, at least. I recognize quickly Pearl Islands because you have Sandra\n and you have Rupert. Yes! HUNTER:\n All from Pearl Islands. That was number seven,\nright before All-Stars. We know Parvati\nplayed in Cook Islands, before Tocantins, because Parvati had won\nby Heroes vs. Villains. And so we know\n it's Cook Islands and then Caramoan. We keep going.\n I remember Tocantins, which is Tyson,\n like, my favorite player. I just always smell\nlike flowers and exotic fruits. HUNTER:\n You have Redemption Island, where Boston Rob and them -come back. -You gotta hustle if you want to make a dollar. HUNTER:\n I love those seasons, so\n those were pretty easy for me. Ka\u00f4h Rong is, like, the one where Caleb passed out. Panama was before Cook Islands. I think I've been\n doing pretty well. But, also, it's just fun\n to walk down memory lane and be inspired by all the other\npeople who have played before. Eight was All-Stars. But if this is number seven,\nthat's not possible. So we have to figure out\nwhere I'm missing something. Golly.\nThis is gonna be impossible. Why didn't\nI watch them in order? I can look at these logos\n and say things that happen in the season,\n but it wasn't questions about what happened\nduring the season. It was a question of the order. There's a big gap here.\nWhat happens between here? This is 28. This is 22. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,\nno, no, no, no. But as you sit there, your brain's not\n functioning at full capacity because you haven't slept well\n and you haven't eaten well. And so you're like, \"I really need you\nto, like, really kick in and tell me the order.\" Ooh. Golly. Also, there's this timer\nticking in your head, and you're like, \"Did Debbie\ncome back for a Second Chance or did she come back\nfor Game Changers? It's nauseating,\nfrustrating and I'm pissed! HUNTER: Pretty sure she came back\n for Game Changers. And so, as the timer's\n running out, I am as content\n as I'm gonna be. But, you know, if I miss\neven one of these things, then I lose my vote. Feel good about these\nright here. I mean, that could be the order. Oh, dear. Time to flip. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. (laughs):\nNo. No. No. No. I got-I got those way off. There, there,\nthere, there, there. And then switch those two. Not great. Eight out of 20. Not great. That is not a passing grade. I lost my vote because I didn't\nknow the order of the logos. Which sounds terrible, but if this whole plan works with Q and Tim-- the brochachos,\nlike, the meathead thing-- that's good for my game. Those connections\n going into merge could be worth\n a million dollars. Always risky to put yourself\non that boat and take a journey, but that's what\nmakes Survivor so fun.

Oh, my God.\n-Blueberry. -That's the best thing\nI've ever had in my life.\n-In my whole life. We just won\nour first immunity challenge. I have been starving, and after 11 days, no fire, no food,\n we just dive in. Oh. I'm elated. Oh, my God. We're literally just,\n like, stuffing our faces. \"Give me this muffin.\" Like... (exhales)\nIt was beautiful. -Ah.\n-Ooh. I never tasted\nanything better than that. But most importantly, I didn't have to\n vote out anybody. I still got Kenzie,\n I still got Q, and the comeback kids\nare coming back. -Hey, welcome back.\n-Q: I'm so tired. TIFFANY:\nYeah, like, I know\nyou're friggin' starving. Where's the food? We saved\nyou a third of everything. TIFFANY:\nThat chocolate muffin\nis bussin'. (laughs) Q:\nThat hit the spot. Hey, buddy. You like Q? -I like you, too.\n-KENZIE: Isn't he cute? -Fine time to come home with me.\n-(chuckles) The unbelievable happened. Winning is, like... I don't even have words. Like, I could explode.\nI'm so happy for us. We finally got our flint. So the record now dies at day 11. Q:\nWe never stopped fighting. That's what life is about. KENZIE:\n We've held on\n through the 11 days of no fire,\nthe 11 days of no food, the 11 days of rain, and loss\n and losing tribe members. We've held this little spark. And that was just enough\n to keep us going. Q:\nWe finally have a nice fire. The first fire on Yanu with a hibiscus flower\nin my hair. Just the way I wanted. I'm so excited. We don't have to worry\nand, like, fight for our lives. We get to just relax as friends\nfor the first time, truly. Comeback kids. -(whoops)\n-Yes. KENZIE:\n We did it. \u266a \u266a MORIAH: Didn't fall\n our way today, but... -Yeah...\n-But, you know, I will say, even though Yanu won, and we're obviously here,\nlike, people need a moment to feel a little sane. -And I'm glad\nthey finally got one.\n-MARIA: Yeah. MORIAH:\nWe've had a blessing\nof a time out here. 11 days, six strong. Going to Tribal, it's our first vote.\n People are scared. And we have this wonderful, looming question mark\nof what idols and advantages are gonna come out\nof the woodworks tonight. Maria has an extra vote\n from the first journey. Ben also went on a journey. He also might have\n some advantage or a lost vote. Who really knows? I mean, Tim's on the journey, right? Journeys are terrifying. He could be\n coming back with something. And then, on top of that,\n we have this mysterious Beware Advantage lurking about. And, oh, yeah, everyone has a Shot in the Dark.\nTa-da. Everything\n could go wrong tonight. JEM:\nWe've never\ndealt with this before. So I want to go idol hunting,\nand I'm not talking as a group. -I'm talking, like,\nidol hunting.\n-Just go do your thing. -Okay.\n-All righty.\n-MARIA: All right. Think everybody goes and does -whatever they want to do.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. JEM:\n Oh, my God. I don't have\n a vote for tonight's Tribal. And as soon\nas we lost that challenge, it just, like, hit me. I have to go back\n to the place where I found the Beware Advantage, because\n now I get more information to find the key for\n the immunity idol in the box. Oh, my God. Like, this is crazy. I have to go back to camp, get the machete\n to go measure stuff, and I know that I have to do three different tasks.\n And I'm like, \"The tribe is right here. Like, how am I gonna\nget away with it?\" CHARLIE:\nAll right, dude,\nI'm gonna head out there. (whoops) JEM:\n I have to figure out\n how to get my immunity idol before tonight's Tribal Council or I'm gonna lose my vote. Every time I walk this way\n or walk that way, I kind of\n see people in the path. And I was like, \"Jem, you got to go.\nThis is your moment.\" I have three different places\n to measure. The tribe's flag. I need to also measure the perimeter\n of the tribe's boat. I added it up, and it was 12. Tree mail. And then finally\n the perimeter of tree mail. And it's four. \"Boat times logo\nplus tree mail.\" 12 times two is 24, plus the four is 28. I need to go back to where I originally found\n the Beware Advantage and measure 28 machetes\n out towards the beach. Fear crept into my heart. I'm looking to make sure\n nobody's coming. And then I was like, \"Okay. Let's go.\" (quietly): Please, please,\nplease, please, please. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Hooray. I found it. I dig up a rope with a key. And that was the moment I knew that that's the key\nto unlock that box. And emotions,\n like, overwhelmed me. (imitates musical flourish) This is my dream\n coming out here, to find an idol, and I did it,\nand nobody has any idea. Now I got to make sure\n that the women plus Charlie are still going strong, so there's no way tonight\nthat Ben or Tim is not going home.

And I think\nhe already has something. -So how\ndo we want to vote today?\n-MARIA: I don't know. How many votes? I've got two. -I feel really strong.\n-I think we put three on Ben -and two on Tim...\n-MARIA: Yeah, two on Tim.\nI agree. -Let's lock down on that.\n-MORIAH: I like that. -But let's talk to Charlie.\n-MARIA: Okay. We have to go\n to our first Tribal Council, which means get\nmy extra vote from the journey. And I'm willing to use it\nbecause Tim potentially has an idol,\n you know? So I think\n we have to take out Ben, and I think we're four strong\n with Charlie, and so the plan is very foolproof. Maria's pretty confident\nTim has the idol. So that's why\nwe're gonna put two on him. -So he plays his idol,\nand then Ben goes home.\n-Yeah. Okay. Ben is the target. Bam. It's like\nmy heart plummeted in a second. I've gotten very close with Ben\n over the past couple days. Yeah. I'm... I know. It sucks. But he's a really big threat. -Like...\n-Mm-hmm. CHARLIE:\n People are talking about Ben\n as a big-time social threat. He's a magnetic guy. He's charismatic. He's funny.\nIt's true. You know, people like Ben a lot.\n I like Ben a lot. And I want to keep him around, because, ultimately,\n Ben is an asset. MARIA:\nYou're back! (whoops) -Let me tell you\nabout the-the journey.\n-Let's hear it. So, the journey is whoever knows\nthe most Survivor knowledge. Hunter says he'll do it, and so-so I'm not doing it. -Nothing happened.\nI didn't get anything.\n-BEN: Yeah. I didn't play.\nI didn't get anything. JEM: In my gut feeling, I feel like\nTim is not being truthful about the journey. And so we want to vote Ben out,\n 'cause that's just an easy vote,\njust in case Tim has something. I know that\n Tim doesn't have the idol. I have it. I'm gonna be bringing it\n just in case I need to use it tonight,\n because I'm so worried. Like, Ben and Tim\nare up to something big. So I have\n to find out what their plan is for tonight's Tribal Council. -Look, I'm the judge.\nI got the gavel.\n-Listen... -Listen, I know...\n-Uh-huh? ...you and Tim have\na really strong relationship. -Everybody says that,\nbut you don't... we don't...\n-Listen... -Yeah.\n-This is Jem, okay? Okay? Okay? -So this is not...\n-If you only knew\nwhat we laugh about. -I don't care\nwhat you laugh about.\n-Okay. -But I want to be part\nof the laugh is what I'm saying.\n-Okay. I don't know, dude. -You're holding a machete.\n(laughs)\n-Honestly, -but, like, whoever you want\nto vote for, like, let me know.\n-Yeah. I will vote with you,\nwhoever you guys think. -Please, tell me, honestly.\nI'm all about honesty.\n-(laughs) -Yeah. -BEN: Jem corners me. She's trying\n to get some information, 'cause she's gunning for me.\nYou just know when you know. She's holding the machete.\n So I grab the hammer. I'm, like,\n trying to hold my space. -Tonight is do-or-die. Yeah.\n-I know. It's do-or-die. And I will not flip. -I'm looking you\nstraight in the eyeballs.\n-I know. I'm not blinking,\nand I wouldn't flip. -Trust in your gut.\n-It's, like... She's like, \"Go with your gut.\" And my gut is telling me\n Jem's playing at all costs and if we keep her around,\n she's just gonna screw us at the next vote,\nbecause she's so, like... It's chaos mode. And I know she's approached Tim,\n'cause I saw it and I heard it. Let me know who to vote for,\nand look at me. I will vote with you. You're not looking at me.\nTell me what I got to do. BEN:\nI'm just hoping we take Jem out. The problem is, nobody knows\nI don't have a vote. -Jem's in chaos mode.\n-TIM: Yeah, I bet. I had to grab the hammer 'cause\nshe was holding the machete. And she goes,\n\"You know I'm loyal. Like, you know\nwe can work together.\" And she just\nkeeps interrupting me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. BEN:\n Me not having a vote,\n it definitely blows. But, like, Jem-- she's kind of, like, made everybody\nfeel a little bit on edge. She's on endgame mode. But if you come into a game\n like this already thinking about the million dollars\nand you're not thinking about every step along the way,\nyou're never gonna get there. -Jem confronting\nall of us like that...\n-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now, potentially,\nyou don't have a vote? BEN:\nJust assuming\nI don't have it, right? If you, Tim and Charlie\nstick on Jem, it's still a majority. CHARLIE:\n Maria and I have been\n playing the middle the entire time\n we've been out here. I go back and forth.\nI think Maria goes back and forth. And right now,\n we're at that crossroads. Okay. Just tell me\nwhere your head's at. -(sighs)\n-(chuckles softly) We can go with the women--\n Jem and Mo-- or we could go with Tim and Ben\n and with the men. This is the thing\nthat makes me nervous is, I heard you saying that\nyou're feeling close to Ben. Just, like, you feel\nbonded to him, and... So I'll tell you\nwhere my head's at with Ben. We need threats in front of us. -He's a shield.\n-Yeah. And he is a charisma\nrock and roll shield. MARIA:\n Clearly, Charlie's more keen on working\nwith Ben and Tim, but, you know,\n trust is a big deal for me. I think working with Jem and Mo, we have a much deeper amount\nof trust. Like, I don't... I don't trust Ben and Tim. I have flip-flopped\nlike a kid on a seesaw, because I think that Jem will be loyal to us\n down the line. We have to think long-term. CHARLIE:\n Jem and Ben both have reasons\nto catch votes tonight. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay. All right.\n-Let's do this. Jem's playing really hard,\n making people be very wary of her. So you don't hit me\nwith the machete. CHARLIE:\n Ben's strength is his humor, but that's just as dangerous\nas it is fun to be around. Tonight, we find out\nthe alliances. MORIAH:\nLine in the sand. CHARLIE:\n At Tribal, there's\n no more flip-flopping. It's all about Maria and I putting our cards on the table\n and not looking back. And all of a sudden,\n you've got six people who yesterday were hunky-dory,\n dancing the salsa, and today, we're scared out of our minds\nthat our dream's gonna end, you know, no more salsa.

This is part of the ritual\nat Tribal Council because in this game,\nfire represents your life. When your fire's gone,\nso are you. That will be the case for\none of the six of you tonight. So, Ben, the upside\nof not coming to Tribal until day 11 is obvious. All six people\nare still in the game. So what do you do,\nfrom an individual standpoint, when you all share\none thing in common: you've never been to Tribal? Definitely feels\nlike some Ozzy Osbourne -\"going off the rails on a crazy\ntrain\" in every direction.\n-(Moriah laughs) Everybody, I think,\nis sussing out a vibe. We've been calling ourselves\n\"the vibe tribe\" since day one,\nand now the reckoning has come. Maria, how does it impact\nthe first Tribal when you've spent so many days\nrelying on each other, surviving in the jungle, and now\nyou got to vote somebody out? I think this is the time\nwhere we rip off the Band-Aid. And this is gonna hurt,\ndoing it at day 11, I think, than having to do it\nat day two or three, because we gel so well together. -We're even dancing together.\n-Yeah. Yeah, we learned how to salsa\ndance from Maria yesterday. It's like being\nat a retreat sometimes. -Wake up, shred the aqua dump.\n-(laughing) -Then everybody's, like...\n-Yeah, normal retreat, yeah. -Just to clarify,\nwe do not aqua dump together.\n-Yeah. MORIAH:\nThat's the one\nsolo activity we do. But it feels like we're living in Survivor la-la land. JEM:\nJeff, it goes like this. \"I'm low on water.\nI want to go to the well.\" -\"Okay, we're coming.\"\n-Five hands. And all six of us walk\nto the water well and to tree mail. We go to bed together, we wake up together. -PROBST: Well, Charlie?\n-Yeah. What all of that equals to me is\nmassive blindside tonight. I'm no math guy,\nbut it seems like you've got the equation right. You know, we don't have\na Hunter or a Q. How we survive is by\nbeing scrappy, by being gritty and working together.\nThat was necessary for us\nto all get to day 11, but we're starting to feel\nthe heat for the first time. It's not just smoke. There's\na whole lot of fire around here. PROBST:\nMoriah, was there\nmuch talk about -idols or advantages\nin the game?\n-MORIAH: Oh, yeah. There's the possibility\nof an idol out there, and I don't know\nhow many votes may be at this Tribal at this point. People may have zero votes. Some people may have two. There may be four extra votes\ncast tonight. Actually,\nI'm really bad at math, so that doesn't totally add up\nto me right now. But I get your point, is that\nthere's this uncertainty -because of journeys\nabout who might have what.\n-Yeah. Yeah. MORIAH:\nYeah. And then, we're a hot mess when it comes\nto, like, Beware Advantages. We've had, like, a laundry list of debacles over at camp. CHARLIE:\nJeff, Maria found what we assumed\nwas a Beware Advantage. All the advantage says\nis \"dig down.\" So we get digging, and we get\ndigging, and we get digging. And then we rip the whole\ntree up, and there's nothing. And all six Sigas have been\npouring a whole lot of energy into a whole lot of nothing. -Over three days,\n-Emphasis on \"hole.\" PROBST:\nSo, Maria, what's the conclusion that you've come to? -That you haven't found it?\n-MARIA: Well, that's a really\ngood question, Jeff. I think that it must have been found\nby someone else before me. Yeah. So, Jem, you're in\nan interesting dilemma as a group of six because\nyou formed these relationships, people that you like\nand want to work with. So was there any debate for you about who you wanted\nto vote out tonight? I'm sitting here\nand I am lost for words because I'm still\ntrying to think who I might want\nto put on the parchment. And there's no name\nthat's coming up. Like, can I write\nyour name down? -(laughing)\n-You can't write\nmy name down, Jem. I'm here forever. Sorry. Sorry. Permanent immunity idol. So, Tim,\nwhat is about to happen? Because even right now,\neverybody's smiling and yet a name will be written down, and I'm guessing\none of the six of you are going to be\nvery surprised it's you. -Am I right?\n-You're absolutely right. But we might just\nall be playing a very, very good game\nright now so that nobody feels targeted before we all start\nmarching up those steps. Maria, that rings very true. It does.\nI think that we all, deep down, know\nwhat we're gonna write down. I think all of us are lying by saying we don't know\nwhat we're gonna do. Jem, do you think\nthat's a group feeling or is that just\nwhere Maria's at? I think nobody\nwants to rock the boat. Just thinking about it,\nthere's so many options, right? If you want to move forward\nin this game, you have to be able to,\nlike, trust the alliances you made right now. Ben, is it possible that\ntonight's vote does more damage than just one person going home 'cause you can no longer\ntrust everybody? BEN:\nI mean, that's always\na possibility. I know I'm still getting\na Siga tattoo either way. You know?\nWe've all talked about it. But, um, yeah, obviously, you never know\nif somebody's gonna feel like they were on the bottom,\nand if we get to another side, why would I want to work\nwith those people in the merge? So you never know, but\nthat's the thing about Survivor. One vote,\none challenge at a time. Hopefully,\nyou get to your long goal. PROBST:\nCharlie, how will this tribe be different\nafter tonight's vote? CHARLIE:\nI think it's a test of can this tribe face a loss\nand still be the vibe tribe, or is the vibe tribe a mask\nthat we've been wearing and after tonight, it's been ripped off\nand it's not coming back? MARIA:\nBut I think, Jeff, that at the end of the day,\nwe have to separate emotions and game. Easy to do? Very difficult to do. PROBST:\nAll right, it is time to vote.\nTim, you're up. \u266a \u266a I'm so scared and so nerding out\nat the same time. BEN (whispering):\nNo vote. We'll see how it goes.\nAll right. (whispering): \"...is when there\nare six players in the game.\" I'll go tally the votes. If anybody\nhas an advantage or an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Ben. Jem.\nOne vote Ben, one vote Jem. Ben.\nThat's two votes Ben. Jem. We're tied.\nTwo votes Ben, two votes Jem. Jem. That's three votes Jem,\ntwo votes Ben. Fifth person voted out\nof Survivor 46: Jem.\nNeed to bring me your torch. Jem, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp. Good night.
