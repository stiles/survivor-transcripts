46,10,Run the Red Light,"What was the ... point? He's literally an idiot. No one's gonna trust Q
 from now on. Karma is a bitch. JEFF PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... -...that now we could
pull off a blindside.
-Mm-hmm. KENZIE:
 Everyone is so distracted,
 I could drive something
that's a little risky. The idol has zero value
to me now. -I'm ready
to burn it on the spot.
-Right. CHARLIE:
 Tiff's gonna play her idol,
 so now we've got to figure out
 what the heck we're gonna do. -Yeah.
-Yeah. HUNTER:
 I'm beginning
 to feel pretty nervous. HUNTER:
 So I am 100% playing my idol. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol, and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Tenth person voted out and the third member
of our jury-- Hunter. Hunter, the tribe has spoken. Yes, they have. HUNTER:
 There it is in all of its splendor. LIZ:
 After Tribal Council, I was so ticked off. No one told me
 there was a split vote between Q and Hunter. And so I am trying to... hold my composure
so I don't explode, but I'm thinking, ""What the heck, you ho-bags?"" How y'all feeling?
Y'all okay? I just want to know
what is it about me that made y'all say,
""No, we don't want to let Liz in on the split vote""? VENUS:
Honestly, Liz,
everything happened ten minutes before Tribal,
and there was... -By the time...
-Is that true? -That is straight-up
what happened.
-That's straight-up. Well, damn. TIFFANY:
We thought he had an idol, and we was like,
""All right, well, just in case,
let's just split the votes."" They're like,
""How are we gonna do that?"" -We're like, ""Well,
Liz is already voting...""
-LIZ: Okay. 'Cause I felt stupid as .... We said, ""Liz is
already voting with you."" Like, stupid as ... just now. Considering
 I was the only person left out of this vote, I feel pretty dumb. On top of that,
 I wanted to get Q out. He did almost blow up my game, and he's not someone
that I can trust moving forward. Hunter's also got to be crazy to
not see that blindside coming. If he had an idol,
he should have played it. No, he overplayed his hand
and he thought, ""I can save this
for the next time because clearly
everyone hates Q right now."" TIFFANY:
 Tonight, Tribal erupted
as Jeff predicted it would. Once again, Q was causing chaos, and because of that, it kind of threw Hunter
 off the scent. If he did have an idol, I guess
the smokescreen was so good that he didn't play it
because now our biggest physical threat
is on his way to the jury house. He's grown. If he wants to... If he wants to reconcile things,
he could come talk. At this point, my immediate
 next step is to get Q out. I'm tired of the drama,
 I'm tired of the chaos. That man did too much. He flew too close to the sun,
and his wings burnt off. And now
he's feeling the pressure. KENZIE:
Is Maria on the beach with Q? Yeah. Maria went
to go talk to Q, I think. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. -Okay?
-Come on. Come here. MARIA:
 Right now Q is, like,
 sitting back in the shadows. Q is sort of checked out
of the game mentally. But I think that Q still
 has some fight in him. So, for me, this is
a great opportunity to connect, but he's a wild card
at this point. I know, basically, I got
to win the rest of the way, and, you know, I'm cool
with going through like that. And when I lose,
if I go home, I go home. At this point,
 I think everyone wants me out, so there's no need
for me to go around and sit around the fire
and talk to these people. They really don't want
to talk to me. So I'm okay with that. Right now
 my strategy moving forward is, first win the immunity. If I can win, and now that
it's in the individual stage, I control my own destiny. I'm not out of this game,
 trust me. It might look like it,
but it's not. Yeah. Q is not only a good person, but, like, he's also a number
 that I can use to vote with me, and so I... I definitely want
to keep him around. (Maria mutters) MARIA:
 Q's an easy vote. Everybody wants him out,
 but in my mind there are bigger targets here,
 and so it may be time
to focus on somebody else. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (birds squawking) KENZIE:
Good morning. -Good morning.
-Good morning, Kenzie. Oh. How do you feel
about yesterday's vote? KENZIE:
I mean, I'm glad
it went the way it did. Like... I think we can. I know that
this is a hard thought for you, but I think Q would be willing
to work with us, um, in that,
he told me last night, ""I'm a vote. Use me."" MARIA: Yesterday
the plan was to blindside Tiff, but then
 we switched it to Hunter. But the biggest thing
for me is that Tiff has an idol. That's not a secret. And... Tiffany's sort of been
on my radar for a while. Evidently, she's still
 on Kenzie's radar, too, which is just music to my ears. -I want her gone regardless.
-Okay. KENZIE:
 Tiff has been my number one
 since day one. We have voted the exact same way
 this entire game. Tiff and I have made
every move together. We have played
 almost the exact same game, so I've got to differentiate. I've got to build my résumé, and a huge checkpoint on your résumé
is voting out your number one. That means I just need to be
 a little more sneaky than her to get her out first
before she comes for me. 'Cause I know it's coming.

You're gonna earn it again. Yay. PROBST:
I got to say, Charlie, today you all look
noticeably smaller. -Yeah.

the clothes are big. Your bodies are shrinking. Are you starting
to feel that cumulative effect? Listen, every time I stand up, I literally feel like
I'm about to faint, you know. I have to go back down
on my hands and knees. I've never felt that
ever before in my whole life. All right, shall we get
to today's reward challenge? (all assent) PROBST: For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race through a series of obstacles
 until you reach a sack of sandbags. You're gonna throw
those sandbags into a net tunnel and then use your hands
 to get 'em out the other side. Once they're all through,
 you'll grab one last sandbag, go under a net, crawl,
 and attempt to land that sandbag
 on a very tall target. First person
to finish wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yes.
-You know we do.
-PROBST: It's day 18. You've gone a long time
without food. You passed up
the opportunity at rice. So I know you're gonna be glad
to hear that you're playing for the biggest reward
of the season. -(gasping)
-Applebee's. -Yes!
-(cheering) -Wow.
-Oh, my God. -(whooping)
-VENUS: Oh, my God. You want burgers? -Wings.
-Yeah.
-Yes. -I want chicken wings.
-PROBST: Wings. -And French fries.
-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. -PROBST: French fries?
-MARIA: Yes. I think we got you covered. (cheering) -For real?
-Yes. Every Wednesday,
my daughter and I have -Survivor sleepover.
-Wow. We go directly to Applebee's,
I get the burger, she gets the pizza,
and then we go home. Then we watch Survivor. Yay! Oh, if only
you can win this challenge. ♪ Burger! ♪ All right,
let me walk you through what's in store for the winner. All the apps you love. Boneless wings. -Oh, my God.
-Oh. -Spinach and artichoke dip.
-Oh, God. -Aah!
-Chicken quesadillas. Oh! We're just getting started,
Charlie. -(Charlie groans)
-Perhaps you're interested in the Bourbon Street
Chicken & Shrimp. -Yeah.
-Or maybe you're in the mood, like Liz, for a burger. How about
the Bourbon Street Mushroom -Swiss Burger?
-That's my favorite. -Oh, my God.
-That's 100% ground beef. It's my favorite one. Damn. Smothered in sauteed onions -and mushrooms.
-Jeff, you're killing us. -MARIA: Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Somebody say dessert? -Yes. Yes. Chocolate. Chocolate.
-LIZ: The chocolate one -I was telling you guys about.
-PROBST: We got some dessert. How about the Oreo cookie shake? -Ah!
-Yeah. I might eat it
even though I'm allergic. And to close it out, an Applebee's reward
would not be complete without the Shark Bowl. (overlapping chatter) PROBST:
Applebee's rum -cocktail favorite.
-Ah. Ooh, careful now. All this can be yours
if... you win this challenge. -Ah!
-All right,
we'll draw for spots. -Get it on. Let's do it.
-Do it. All right, here we go. Applebee's. Biggest reward
of the season, Survivor 46. Survivors ready? -(sighs)
-Go! You're going over, over and through
with this first obstacle. Everybody moving quickly. Q is out first, then Tiff. Here comes Ben.
Start untying your sandbags. Charlie's through. Liz is through. -And Kenzie's... through.
-(groans) Once all your bags are out,
start launching 'em in that net tunnel. Keep tossing. Q has all his through. Q in the lead. Ben is now through. Tiff is through,
working on hers. It is Q, Tiff,
Venus, Charlie and Ben. Maria, Liz and Kenzie
still working to get all their bags in. Q is through. He's working
on that last sandbag. That's the money right there.
That's the one you're going
to land on the target. Day 18, Applebee's on the line. (Liz groans) PROBST:
It's Q in the lead. There's Tiff. Q working
through that net crawl. Oh. PROBST:
Here goes Maria. She's in it. Here comes Tiffany. Everybody else is working
on their sandbags now. Tiff is moving quickly
through that net crawl. That's how you do it. Q is out. Get that sandbag
and start tossing. All you got
to do is stick that sandbag at the top of that target. Charlie's in the net crawl. There's Ben. Venus is there. -(Kenzie groans)
-Kenzie struggling
to get through. Oh, my God.
It's so hard. Liz in dead last. 18 days of fatigue
showing up right now. The answer to your problem
is Applebee's. -You just got to earn it.
-Ah! Q with the first toss.
He's got a time lead. Tiff is out.
Start untying, Tiff. Q with another toss. Q just misses. Here goes Tiff. Tiff on and off
with her first toss. Here's Maria. Got to get that sandbag out. Here comes Ben. Charlie's through. Venus is through.
Bunch of people through at once. Everybody on the sandbags
except for Kenzie and Liz, taking a very long time
through the net crawl. -Oh, my God.
-Keep fighting! -You're still in this.
-(groaning) Q is on and off. Here goes Maria. Maria's short. Ben way short. Charlie's short.
Everybody's short. Somebody's gonna win this, and
the whole day is gonna change. Want that burger! PROBST:
Here comes Liz. -Kenzie's through.
-Oh, my God. PROBST:
Let's go! One toss is all it takes. This is what you dream about when you dream about Survivor. This moment right here. Venus with the right height,
just a little short. Tiff is on and off again. Tiff and Q have been very close
several times. Who's gonna pull it out? (grunts) Kenzie way short. Here goes Liz
with her first toss. -Ah!
-Liz almost sticks one. -Oh, that was close.
-KENZIE: That was close, Liz. PROBST:
Sandbags everywhere. Day 18, Applebee's on the line. All it takes is one toss. Tiff a little long. Here goes Q. Q does it! Q wins reward! -VENUS: Way to go, Q.
-PROBST: Applebee's. -Biggest reward of the season.
-BEN: Good job, Q. VENUS:
You killed it, my guy. PROBST:
Nothing easy out here. Everybody exhausted. All right, Q, come on over. Got some talking to do. -Whoo!
-All right, so, congratulations.
-Thank you. You have earned a great reward, biggest of the season--
Applebee's. Gonna sweeten the deal a little.
This reward is gonna take place at the sanctuary, -where good things happen.
-Ah. PROBST:
And it's an overnight stay. -MARIA: Oh, my God. Wow.
-Wow. You have a lot of power
in the game and a lot
of strategic decisions to make. Choose one person to join you. Q:
So, Jeff, in my everyday life, I always
try to make things right. So, for my first choice,
I'm gonna choose Tiff. PROBST:
Tiff, come on over. VENUS:
Yay. PROBST: What an interesting
choice, given the last Tribal
where you two were done. Jeff,
I'm-I'm actually surprised, but I am excited because
I do feel like we need to talk in, like, a setting
where it's not high pressure, not a whole bunch
of people around and just really be able
to hash things out. PROBST:
All right, Q, choose another person
to join you. -I'm gonna beg.
-PROBST: Before you decide... I'm gonna beg. Please. PROBST:
Well, Liz is already begging. LIZ:
Please. Q:
The next choice
that I'm gonna make, Jeff, it's just based off, when I was out there by myself, there was one person that came
and checked on me, genuinely, wanted to know
if I was all right. So I just want to say thank you. And the next choice
I'm gonna make is Maria. -Thank you.
-PROBST: Maria, come on over. -Thank you.
-Yeah. (crying) PROBST:
All right, Q,
you have one more person. So it's gonna be four people
at the sanctuary for Applebee's, four people back at camp,
and you have one person, Liz, sobbing, has talked about food
this entire season, how she can't eat
certain things, therefore she's more hungry. But it's also
a million-dollar game with only a few people left. (Liz sniffles, cries) Q:
Liz-- she hasn't eaten, um, in almost 18 days. This is something
that she could potentially eat. But Kenzie was with me
since day one, um, and it's something
in me is saying, ""Bring the family
back together."" So my decision is basically going to be
to bring Kenzie. -Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Come on over, Kenzie. (crying) PROBST:
The Yanu three
is back together again after declaring they were dead
at Tribal Council. Q:
Sorry, y'all. (sniffling, crying) Liz, do you feel comfortable talking
about what you're feeling? (birds singing) I'm pissed! Y'all say
you ain't gone without eating. I see you eat every day! (sighing deeply) Q, you almost blew up
my whole game! You overshadowed
everything I was trying to do! And I said it's cool. I didn't say nothing! (Liz groans) I don't even want
to be around y'all! I'm just... Q... ...you blew up
my whole freaking spot. I didn't even know
about the damn -split vote last night.
-Q: But, Liz, you voted for me
last night, so... I made decisions based off
where my head is right now in the game. I'm sorry. (Liz sighing) LIZ:
I'm over it now. Thank y'all
for letting me have that. I feel better. I just exploded. I'm sorry. Back to your regularly
scheduled program. Liz, you don't have to apologize
for having your emotions. Obviously, missing out on rice is coming into play now. I haven't eaten since the merge. I've had zero calories
since the merge. But there's hope
in the game always. I don't even think I screamed
that hard during my divorce. (laughs, groans) All right,
here's what's gonna happen. Q, Kenzie, Tiff, Maria, you're gonna leave here,
go to the sanctuary. Applebee's chef is there
waiting for you. Fresh, beautiful
Applebee's food. You will spend the night,
get a good night's sleep, and return to camp
in the morning. -Head out,
enjoy a well-deserved afternoon.
-Thanks, Jeff. MARIA:
Thank you. Thanks, Q. PROBST:
Liz, Ben, Venus, Charlie, got nothing for you. Grab
your stuff. Head back to camp. LIZ:
 I am... so... angry. Q screwed me over.
 Not only am I not going on this reward,
not only am I not eating, but now I'm not feeling
 that connection to my daughter and our Survivor ritual, and I'm gonna have to go back and just sit in all this disgusting feelings. Uh, look, Survivor's tough. Think you can do it? Let's see.

to do that to Q at least once. LIZ:
 I'm so mad at Q. I mean, everyone's aware
that I have allergies. On Survivor, I can't really eat much. I'm allergic to coconut,
 most fruits, chicken. A lot of everyday foods
 causes my throat to clench. But I can eat
 any kind of beef, and the burger is the exact burger
that I order. It's like our thing.

 connection with this meal-- I don't know
what kind of person does that. You, of all people,

her go-to menu item. My anger is satisfying
my hunger right now. Yeah, my need for vengeance. BEN:

 Q is working from the bottom, so the only option he has is
 to rekindle his old alliances. But I think they would be idiots

 ""Oh, my God. ""I couldn't even eat the bacon. I'm lactose intolerant,
but I ate the milkshake anyway."" I mean, shut up. Like, read the freaking room. I'm just, like,
 all over the place. But as much
 as this not eating is making my mind kind of crazy, I do still have
my eyes on the prize. I'm sorry, Q.
I'm sorry I exploded. You're allowed
to express your emotions. I was just really hungry. So I decided to say I'm sorry for my outburst
 at the challenge. It's the biggest lie I've
ever said in this game so far because, honestly,
 I want to vote Q out. I was lying. I'm not sorry. I'm definitely not. I'm super proud of myself
for yelling at him. (chuckles) I will be having
a hot girl summer, though, when I get home. -Luckily, I...
-The Survivor diet. (chuckles) Be back to, like,
my tenth grade body weight. Q:
Liz apologized for her outburst, but I'm not concerned
 with what Liz thinks. I'm not ashamed
of going on a reward that I won. I can choose who I want,
 and, of course, there's gonna
 always be someone mad. (groans loudly) Q:
 Hey, it's a business decision. Uh, just like at home,
if I fire someone, I don't care if they're kicking
and crying on the floor. They have to go. So, at the end of the day, an apology out here,
you can keep it. -Okay. What's the quick update?
-All right. So Q proposed Venus, then Liz. -CHARLIE: Okay.
 -MARIA: And then the ladies proposed Q out first. CHARLIE:
 So, is the Tiff blindside off? MARIA:
 For now, but... I think that
it's all gonna come down to if Q wins immunity or not. -Okay.
-But what were
you all proposing? I-I was thinking
that it would be... Tiff. Is that what
everyone here was talking about? -No.
-Okay. -CHARLIE: Q.
 -MARIA: Okay. CHARLIE: That's all
 we were talking about. MARIA: After Q did not take Liz
 on the reward, everybody wants him out. The only thing that scares me
is that... Tiff has an idol. -Yeah.
-Which is why I'm like... -I don't know how long
that can be on the back burner.
-Right. The problem is,
 Tiff has an idol, and it's something that, like, we really have
 to get out of this game, but everybody is just like, ""We want Q gone."" But Q is causing chaos. And he proved himself capable
 of winning challenges. So if we have an opportunity,
he should go. MARIA:
I think if he doesn't win,
he's got to go. -Yeah.
-VENUS: I-I agree. Yeah. I made my feelings pretty clear. CHARLIE:
 Everybody is saying,
 ""Beat Q at all costs."" But for me and Maria, Tiffany
 could be more of a threat. So I don't want
 Tiffany to win either. So we need to make sure
that Tiffany and Q lose this challenge. Fo r yo ur m os t br il li an t sm il e, Crest has you covered. ♪♪ (laughing) Nice smile, Brad. Nice! Thanks? Crest 3D White. 100% more stain removal. Crest. [T en se M us ic ] One Aleve works all day so I can keep working

in the individual rice. Well, I mean,
if two other people want to step out, but I know this is, like, really high stakes. So let's just find out. Is there anybody here that's even contemplating it? No. PROBST:
Q? No? If I step out, I go home. I'm not dropping that bucket. PROBST: So, if we
don't make a deal today, it's safe to assume
we're probably -not going
to make a deal this season.
-Yeah. -All right,
Kenzie, you've stepped back.
-KENZIE: Yeah. So you're gonna compete. If the whole group was in it, I was gonna go for it,
but I think I'll be able to make it without the rice
because I can eat coconut. So I'm not judging Liz at all. I'm like, ""Get the rice, girl."" I would judge you more
if you didn't, honestly. -I would be like, ""Just do it.""
-PROBST: Liz, your entire tribe is saying ""Go for it."" They know you're hungry.

 that Charlie won immunity because, aside from the fact
 that I just want a chance at wearing
 the immunity necklace, I wanted to be the one to beat Q and send him home. He tried to destroy my game,
 and there's no way under this Fijian sun that I would let that go. I want Q gone. Charlie. Pulling it out. TIFFANY:
 Tonight is an easy vote. Myself, Kenzie, Charlie,
 Ben, Maria, Venus and Liz are all
 on board to send him home. I haven't heard a single person utter another name today
besides Q. -Liz with the rice.
-KENZIE: Whoo! TIFFANY:
But when there's idols in play,
 people start to act stupid. I need somebody to make fire,
honestly. TIFFANY:
 I have been doing a lot
 of debating about this idol because,
 now that it's out there, I know that the clock is ticking
 on when I have to play it. -CHARLIE: There it is.
-TIFFANY: Ooh. However, Q kind of blew up his own game and
has been causing chaos at camp. He's now the biggest target. He's a strong competitor. He's won the individual reward, and he's proven that, like,
he can beat us. Can somebody throw me a coconut? I think I'm gonna
crack one open. I'm a betting woman, so I'm putting my chips
 on the table and I'm making a bet. Tonight I'm betting I can keep my idol in my pocket
because Q is going home. MARIA:
...I'd love to get the idol out. KENZIE:
Yeah, I would
love to get it out, too, but if she plays her idol
tonight, and we all vote Tiff, -it's gonna be really,
really bad.
-Right. But let's just think. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It seems to be
that Kenzie is having cold feet. It seems to be that Kenzie
 doesn't necessarily think that this is the right time
 to make the Tiffany move, but if I keep sitting back and waiting
for the light to turn green... ...it may not turn green. So I'm gonna have
to run the red light. You're basically in final six. That's so awesome. As long as y'all not trying
to blindside me tonight. (both laugh) KENZIE: I have been working on
this, like, Tiff blindside thing on the side,
but it's just not singing the same heart song
it was to me. I have no respect for Q. I have no respect for the way
 he's playing the game. And I don't want
 to get out Tiff, who wants to be here,
 for someone who doesn't care. It's like spitting in the face of everyone
 who has ever applied, everyone who has
ever tried to be out here, in the face of the jury,
that he just doesn't care. It's annoying. TIFFANY:
 I don't know. Probably she giving him
 some type of encouragement -or something. I don't know.
-Mm-hmm. I'm the easy vote. But you could change that. Like, there are options, but, like,
you got to be in the game. I'm in the game. If you want to take Tiff out, there are options
to take Tiff out. Are you in or are you not in? Q:
 Tonight's vote is life or death, uh, for me. It's gonna be me or Tiff. I go to Vegas a lot,
 and I'm a high roller. I hope tonight I can roll nothing but sevens, and we can send Tiff home. MARIA:
 What are you thinking? Obviously,
Q is an easy vote, but... I'd love to get the idol out. We can take Tiff out tonight. While it may be hard
to work with Q, I think we're gonna
have to work with Q. BEN:
 I have been thinking
 about this vote. Q is a schemer
 and a bit of a bully, and I want him
the hell out of here, but... the argument
 for Tiff being the vote is that everybody
 knows Tiff has an idol, and the idol's more dangerous than Q at this point. I think we got to go
with the Tiff blindside. -Okay.
-Strategically, it's the most... -It's the smartest.
-Shh. MARIA: Now we have
 four votes to get Tiffany out, but in a game where there
are eight people left, that's not enough. -This is how we do it.
-Mm-hmm. Q is down to do Tiff. Okay. MARIA:
Maybe we don't tell Kenzie. CHARLIE:
I was thinking the same thing. We've got Q, Ben, me, Charlie.
That's four. -Thing is,
we need one more solid person.
-Personally, I think Liz is the better bet out of... -Liz, I don't trust her...
-But out of Liz and Venus, who do you trust more?
Venus I don't trust. -She'll cause some random chaos.
-BEN: Right. MARIA:
 Venus is not somebody
 I could work with, but the whole fight
 that Liz and Q had makes it really hard looping Liz into the plan. We only have
to get one more vote. I think Liz is better. MARIA: I want Tiffany out,
 and I want it to be today, but Charlie's right. Liz is the key person
 for this plan, and so our plan
is contingent on the person that has
 a personal vendetta against Q. But at some point you've got to make a move. And this is terrifying. It's terrifying
because it could blow up in my face, but it could
also be a game-winning move. (birds chirping) And I agree with that. Ben hates Q. Like, a lot of us don't want Q, but we have one chance. For Tiffany? This is the only night
that we can do this. -Okay.
-And you are the key holder. LIZ:
 Tonight's vote is making
 the wheels turn in my head. I think Maria wants
 to make this bold move for the jury, but I really, really dislike Q. Plus I have
a personal vendetta against Q because he didn't pick me
 for the Applebee's reward. I know Tiff has an idol, and that
 is something to consider. So it's gonna be
 a really hard battle between my mind and my heart. Getting Tiff out with an idol,
 without her even playing it, it's a huge, huge move. On the other hand, voting Q out, seeing Jeff snuff his torch would be just
 as sweet as that juicy, delicious Bourbon Burger. Like, peace out, brother.

-(laughs) -It's all good? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scared me. Okay. Let's review where the game is. Every single person
on the jury is there as a result
of a massive blindside. Q, you have been
an unwitting smoke screen the last two Tribals. So, once again,
let's start with you. Did the day center
around you a lot? A little? So, Jeff,
over the last three days, um, I've been calm. I lay on the beach.
If they approach me, good. If not, I don't bother people. Right now I have no power,
so I can only put the trust in the people around me. PROBST:
Tiff, this is a different story, 'cause the last two Tribals, everything
was swirling around Q. ""Q's going home. Q's going home.
Q's going home."" Nope. Still here. TIFFANY:
I mean, like Q said,
he kind of just sat back, minded his business,
and he has a keen understanding that, at this point,
it really just is what it is. And today at camp,
for probably the first time in quite a while,
it was actually peaceful. Kenzie, this
is eerily familiar, though. The last two Tribals,
there was this certainty that it was Q going home. Did it feel different today? Today definitely felt different. Q has been, like,
such a good smoke screen for if a blindside
is gonna get pulled off. But today we were all on a-- pretty much an understanding on
what was gonna go down tonight. So let's go back
to the reward challenge. -Biggest reward of the season.
-(whimpers) PROBST:
Q, you win. You're in charge. You choose Maria,
Tiff and Kenzie. Liz was left out,
was frustrated, understandably. It's a long game. She hasn't
eaten, and she let you have it. -(laughs)
-Q: Yes. -That's fair.
-LIZ: I mean,
I said what I said. I said it very loudly
and very publicly, but I didn't want it
to be awkward for everyone. So I apologized to Q. That don't mean I'm,
like, really that sorry. But, like, Q, you and I,
we just can't play together. Q, this is the story. I know, man. (sighs) It's tough, Jeff,
but, you know, I put out a plan, and if four others get on board
and help me out, we'll see where things kind of shake up. But the other folks
might just say, ""You know what?
Kick this guy out."" So, you know,
it's one of those things where it's not in my control. Ben, is it possible
that everybody could jump on board with Q's plan,
and it's not Q again tonight? Personally,
I'm just a bit over it, but, uh, if that does happen,
like, it's beyond me. 'Cause everybody has seemed
to have been on, like, ""Q tonight? Q tonight?"" I mean, it's almost eerie how
on board everybody is with that. Charlie, Ben said it. It's almost eerie. You can't not consider
the fact that something weird's gonna happen again,
because look across. The last two have been
absolute devastating blindsides using Q as the smoke screen. The eerie silence is scary. And I think
there was a moment today where I was
sort of questioning, like, ""Is something going on
that I don't know about?"" And what I realized is that, no, the calm is because
people are on the same page. So that's what
I'm hanging my hat on. Maria, let's talk
about blindsides at this stage of the game. If you're somebody
who pulls off a blindside, you're happy, you're proud.
You should be. You hoodwinked somebody.
That's difficult to do, but they're different
when you have a jury. I mean, I am sure everybody here is thinking to themselves, ""How can I get
something on my résumé?"" Right? Like, there
are three unfortunate people sitting over there
who are thinking to themselves, ""Was this a good move,
or was it not? Am I gonna award
a vote to this person or not?"" And so a blindside
right now is huge. That's just not
the case tonight, unfortunately. PROBST:
Tiff, let's go back
to Q for a moment. There's so much energy around
whether he should be here or not that I'm curious
when the scales tip and suddenly keeping Q
becomes the better move. (laughs softly) Um... PROBST:
Liz is...
Everybody's shaking their head. I don't know if keeping Q
is the better move for anybody. Just based on
what I've been hearing, I don't think
that anybody here thinks that Q is best for their game at
this particular point in time. Again, for me, Jeff, I can only put out an idea. If it doesn't stick
with others, it doesn't make sense for their game,
I can't make 'em vote with me. And I was prepared to go
two Tribals ago. If it's my time, it's my time.
I've accepted it. If my plan is not their plan,

I don't see
any other teams around. -I don't even see anything
that looks like a plaza.
-Ugh! KEOGHAN: A stellar Detour performance... (singing) KEOGHAN:
 ...put boyfriends Ricky
 and Cesar back on top. -You are team number one.
-(whooping) KEOGHAN:
Pilots Juan and Shane stumbled. God, man, we just ate
ten, 15 minutes."
47,2,Epic Boss Girl Move,"Welcome to Survivor 47. (cheering) Previously on Survivor... I was gonna--
I was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.
-Really? -Yeah.
-Yeah, dude. CAROLINE: The guys fell
 in love with each other. It's a bromance. TK:
 ""I caught you in the act."" So now I know I can't fully trust him. That scares me. GABE:
 Now I have power. I'm a dragon sitting on top of a pile of gold. AYSHA:
 We saw Rome at the water well. That is just
suspicious behavior. You seem emotional. I crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon. (cheering) That's a good-ass coconut. Give me some. They don't like me. Right now I would vote Jon. Jon is playing hard. RACHEL:
 Andy is a ticking time bomb,
 and you don't know when it's gonna explode. First person voted
out of Survivor 47: Jon. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ It's gorgeous. There, that reminds me
of Phoenix sunrises. Tribe morale is
 through the roof. You know, if you realize
you're on a winning tribe, it feels absolutely incredible. And in the morning we were
 all chilling on the beach, and the first thing
that goes through my mind is, I need to go and read
 exactly what that box says because I got the key
 for the Beware Advantage. And so, last night... ...I dug it up,
 and once I opened it... it was pitch black.
 I felt the scroll and I felt the idol. So I said, ""You know what? I need to hide this box."" After I re-hid the box,
 I started really thinking, I don't think it's actually
smart to keep it to myself. Maybe it's actually better if I
let someone else know about it. That way they can trust me more. And Teeny-- she's the vibe
 that I'm looking for in an alliance member, someone that I can trust
 in this game one million percent. TEENY: My first thought
 when Rome tells me he has the advantage is,
""Damn it."" Rome was the person
 who everybody wanted out, but it's never that easy. It was pitch black,
 so we couldn't see what he had to do
to get the idol. All we could do was
 just feel the idol. (chuckles)
And then go back. So that changes the plan that I wanted to do, and now I sort of have
 to work with Rome, but I'm gonna tell Kishan. -Let me tell you something.
-Okay, go for it. -He found it.
-(gasps) He found it, and he told me. I don't know why he told me,
but he fully found it. -What?
-He told me, and he showed me where it is. Down-- Oh, oh, come here,
come here, come here. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
The text. KISHAN:
Oh, so that's what... -Hey.
-TEENY: Hey. I got caught with a giant box holding
the biggest secret of the game wide open. But one of my superpowers, I feel, is being able to talk my
 way out of any situation. I just want to say,
like, I told him because I want to work
with this four. -Okay.
-Like, and that's, and that's something
I should have discussed with you and, like, would have,
but I got excited about the box. That's the truth. ROME:
 When I saw them at my box, I'm thinking, like,
 ""What are you doing?"" Like, 100%, I don't know
if I can trust Teeny as much as I could yesterday. When I was finally able to read what was in this box
with them, I was so disappointed. This box said,
 ""You can take it right now, ""and it's good
 for one Tribal Council, ""or you can take this other
 note, do another thing, and then your idol is good
for three Tribal Councils."" What about a normal idol? I took the idol
 that's good for only one, and I played it safe. TEENY:
Yeah, that's why I was like... ROME: Now they both know,
guaranteed, Rome is not gonna be the first one gone from Lavo,
and that is a great feeling. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ GABE:
Look at that. Oh. GABE:
Huge crab. Oh, my God, should we grab it? (Caroline squeals) Oh, my gosh. TIYANA:
Yeah, the pinchers are huge. GABE:
Oh, I got him,
I got him, I got him. SUE:
Oh, my goodness. TIYANA:
Gabe has caught the biggest crab I think I've ever seen
in my life. -TK: That's a boy.
-SUE: Let's go. That's-- need that right there.
That's a good start to the day. SUE:
I'm gonna head back,
though, I'm sweating. GABE:
Found a whole beach over here. TK:
Oh, my God. -It's like you're in heaven.
-This is crazy. -Yeah.
-(laughs) -Wow, this is kind of wild, man.
-If only heaven wasn't
90 degrees and humid. TK: I came into this game
 knowing that I wanted to at least bring
a strong three to the merge. -Can't see that.
-The wave that's breaking -right there?
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Wow. Kyle is my number one. Honestly,
 he seems super genuine. I trust this guy
with my life right now. Gabe, you need to talk
to some people 'cause I-I know... I don't think
anybody's mentioned, like, ""Oh, I got a really good
relationship with Gabe"" yet. -Yeah. -TK: Gabe-- ""idol-hunting Gabe""-- was initially the strong part of
 our three, but he's been playing
 a very erratic game. You don't have to have,
like, a strategy talk, just... Yeah, yeah, start forming
that relationship. TK:
And I don't want to have my game hanging on the heels
 of somebody else who, right now, I can't, quite
frankly, trust all the way. Oh, look,
all these hermit crabs. -Those two.
-Yeah, yeah. I've been wanting
 to talk to Tiyana for some time
 because I think she has a better ability
 to actually connect with people, something that Gabe has not been doing
on this tribe. No, I was just trying to gauge
how you felt about who you felt about here
that you feel strongly -like you could
actually do something with.
-Right. Obviously I-- looking at it
right now, I'm, like, worried -about a bromance with you guys.
-Yeah. I never want to be like,
""Oh, okay,"" like, the bromance and then
I'm the fourth, you know, -'cause that kind of sucks.
-Yeah, yeah. There's not, like, a bromance
thing happening right now. TIYANA: I am absolutely
 surprised to hear that TK wants to actually work with me because, so far,
 there's a huge divide when it comes
 to the girls and guys. -Gabe has already been doing
a lot of... -stuff.
-Right. So, I don't feel comfortable
with that. I really like you,
I really like Kyle, so, if you, me and Kyle
can figure out a way for us to just lock down
us as a three, I'm super comfortable with that. -Straight up?
-Yeah. I think that's a great idea. Okay, I'm glad
we're on the same page. TIYANA: I am elated
 that Gabe actually kind of shot himself in the foot because he went off
 doing sketchy things, and a bromance can only
go so far if the bros don't even trust another bro. That's not a bromance. Yeah, Kyle, so, I called Tiya, and you and I talked,
and I let you know, like, I really bang
with your vibe, and you're a cool dude,
and I trust you, and I would like to have three
people that we can all lock in. KYLE:
That's how I feel as well. I think that you're
a real good person, and I think that
the way that-- that we jive, that there's--
there's a longevity to it. -TIYANA: Oh, absolutely, dude.
-It's-- You know? And I think
that we're very valuable -to one another.
-TK: Hell yeah. TIYANA:
 I really feel like Kyle is a genuine soul, and so Kyle is someone that I think I could
really lean on in this game. TK:
We can make it work, bro. ANDY: Day three was one
 of the most tumultuous days of my life,
 but now that I'm here and I actually survived
the Tribal Council, I just feel like this is such an amazing opportunity
for a recovery. I know my role right now,
in a good way. -It makes me happy.
-Yeah, it's good. I want to be a lightning rod. I am feeling a lot better
in a lot of ways, and I feel
 like they're including me, which is the first step
 of improving your position, is having people include you in the social vibe of the tribe. -Let's get it, Andy.
-Ooh, that's a good one. The layers to Survivor are mind-boggling. Like, Andy wants
 something from us. He wants connection,
he wants to feel included. We want something from him. We want him to be
in a good mindset, we want him to perform
 in challenges, but we also want him
to be the easy boot. (singsongy):
Here we go, Andy, here we go. Right now everybody on Gata
 is trying to make Andy feel as part of our group
as possible. -Yes, we see it!
-SIERRA: Yeah! (whooping) Let's go...! RACHEL:
Let's go, Andy! That's the perfect coconut. -Thank you.
-It is. ANIKA:
 It's very obvious that Andy-- he needs words of affirmation. SIERRA: Yeah, you get on that,
you have that. -ANIKA: That's a good one.
-(Sam whoops) ANIKA:
 I've met a variety
 of different kinds of men on dating apps
 and, specifically for Andy, you can just tell it's giving toxic, clingy boyfriend.
Yeah. SAM:
I'm looking forward
to just not doing anything next. ANDY:
Yeah. You know, the thing is, facing death
and being the first boot and surviving has put me in
a completely different mindset. I have this just
totally new game plan. I could never... SAM:
 Right now I'm on Andy duty, like, just keeping
a watchful eye on him at all times because an idol is the
number one thing that is causing paranoia around Gata right now. I don't know,
I think they went by the rocks. I wonder what they have to talk
about for a long time. -Girl stuff.
-(laughs) -Talking about their hair.
-Yeah. ANIKA:
I feel like it's in, like,
a crook of a tree -or it's at, like,
the base of a tree.
-RACHEL: Yeah. RACHEL:
Yeah, I mean, it's this
tiny piece of parchment, right? I can't find anything ever. I'm like,
""Where's my hairbrush?"" What about Beware? Sh-Should I look or no? -Like, I don't think
you should, because
-I agree. -a lost vote right now, like...
-That's just the... -Yeah.
-All right. SAM: Andy is an oddball,
and it would be very easy for me to kick Andy to the curb. -I got you. You know I got you.
-Let's go. Yeah. SAM:
 But in sports reporting,
 relationships and lines of communication are key. You are just as valuable to me. -Yeah.
-Heck yeah. I want to be Andy's buoy
 in an ocean where he feels
 like he's drowning. If I can have Andy feeling
 like he can come to me with information, that allows me options because you never know when the athlete who's at the bottom
of the totem pole is at the top of the totem pole because they're the hero
in the game. -My mom's gonna love you.
-Good, I-I-- I'm gonna love your mom. Okay. (sighs) When Sam was gone,
 I'm just left alone and my brain starts spiraling. What's going through my mind is,
""Okay, there are some options."" I could just chill here,
make sure that they see me not going off, make sure
 my target doesn't grow. Or put my pedal to the metal and find this advantage. I do not feel
 like I have much time. I feel like Sam and the women will come back to camp,
 really, at any minute. Really, the clock was ticking. SAM:
 I went to the bathroom,
 came back, no Andy. I looked behind me, no Andy. I looked in the bushes, no Andy. Uh-oh. Andy was gone. It's like the babysitter
 takes their eyes off the baby,
 and then, all of a sudden, the house is on fire. (chuckles) Oh... The Beware Advantage gives you a huge decision
 with two options. You can either open it and take that risk or leave it and potentially wait for better timing. (sighs)
I'm gonna do something new. I'm gonna try it out. I'm gonna leave it for now. I don't think
anyone else is looking. I'm gonna brainstorm
what I'm gonna do with it. I have an opportunity
that not many people have taken. If I know where the-the advantage is, and if and when I need an idol, I can pull the trigger. Everybody thinks
they'd be a great player, but there's only
one way to find out. Apply to be on Survivor. Hey, get your head

 Having the camp supplies
 has been everything. We did so much with
nothing for three days, and now we have an axe,
 we have a saw, we have a hammer,
 we just got flint. AYSHA: So, of course, Rome needs to be
 the person in charge. AYSHA: He wanted to be the first one
to make fire. I tried. I was good
at, like, sparking it, but I couldn't-- I wasn't
great at building it up. ROME:
Yeah, I made a fire
every single morning till I came out here. So, my record is 16 seconds
to get a fire. -(Rome laughs) -KISHAN: I think
 Rome's a showman. That's what he does for
a living. He's a commentator. This looks incredible. KISHAN:
 He has a bucket list he came in with. He wants to make the fire. He wants to be the one
 finding the idol. He loves the big, flashy moves. AYSHA:
Try scraping, if you can. -ROME: Oh, wow. That's
-AYSHA: Yeah. way different with a machete. KISHAN:
 My strategy-- it's completely the opposite of that. I think the more low key
 you are, the better, because, you know, you skate
 under the radar. ROME:
I mean, I think that's enough. AYSHA:
Nope. Right there, right there! -Yes! Kishan! Oh, my goodness.
-KISHAN: Yes. -There we go, baby.
-Yes. Besides, he didn't make the fire.
I made the fire. KISHAN: Yeah! SOL: I've never, ever met anybody like Rome. -(chortles) -SOL: Rome is... He's a lot. Definitely had, like,
aspirations to go, like, to the NBA.
I did not have the height,
but I had the speed. -Like--
-Why didn't you get drafted? I stopped playing. I stopped
playing in high school. TEENY: He is just a little bit cocky. I always knew, like,
on the low, I could probably be a rapper

Uh... uh... Like, I forgot it
in my head now. Yeah, I always wish

-ROME: Yeah. TEENY: When you're spending sunrise to sunset with somebody, it's impossible to ignore it. (imitates screeching
connection tone) -(laughs) -TEENY: It's tempting to just want to get him out of here,
 but Rome has an idol. If he didn't have it,
he'd be the easy first boot. So, Rome, right now-- he's
going to be the problem for me. -I mean...
-(Aysha and Teeny exclaim) (Rome laughs) Andy left.
He went looking. I-I go to the bathroom.
I come back, he's gone. ANIKA: Sam was babysitting Andy
 because we need to make sure that
he has no chance of finding
 any sort of advantage. That could mess up
our whole entire plan. I don't think he found anything. I need to make sure that we find it before Andy.
So I suggest to Sam... What if went--
go looking right now? Okay. Anika and I go off under the guise of filling up waters for everybody,
 which very quickly turns into a full-on idol hunt. (groans) SAM:
 You get out here, it is a massive, massive island. And you're looking
 for something about yea big. Like, this tree looks like
a great spot, but... ANIKA:
I don't think they would
put it in this spot. Yeah. Yeah, you took it, you took it.
You got it. SAM:
 I'm taking it. There wasn't really
 a second thought. Like, get the idol. Get yourself
more power in this game. ANIKA:
 What's going through
 my head is, ""Thank God I was there with him."" Head straight to the path. ANIKA:
 Sam is already a threat
 without this advantage. This advantage only makes him
even more of a threat. (exclaims) -That's a lock.
-That's it, -that's it, that's it.
-I think this is a clue. ANIKA:
 We find a map, and there's a red X where the key could be,
 and it's pointing to the set of trees
 near the water well. So, we go, sprinting. We're also carrying
every single person's water bottle at this point. (laughs) Like... -That they're bringing.
-The-- Oh, I know. Hopefully they come back.
I'm, like, thirsty. -You got it? Got it?
-This rope. -SAM: Oh, yeah. -ANIKA: I find a rope, and then we pull out this rope to only discover... -Oh, my God.
There's a lot of this.
-Okay. ...that there are maybe 300... knots tied next to each other. SAM:
Dude, there are so many. We kind of realize that this is going to take a very long time. We've been gone for a while. -Yeah. -SAM: This cannot be done right now.
I will have to find time to come back
 and complete this later. But Anika being there with me is, like, a nightmare.
 I don't want to have a secret with Anika
that I'm not telling Sierra. Holy crap, bro.
Let's go. Sierra is my number one, and I don't want her
 ever thinking I'm withholding
a major piece of information from her.
 Had I found it by myself, maybe it's a different story. I don't love that Anika knows. SIERRA:
I don't love that either. Because if Anika knows,
I'm worried that Anika's gonna tell Rachel, and then
that looks bad on me. -I don't know
if she's gonna tell Rachel.
-Okay, she's probably
gonna tell Rachel. Okay. Pretend that
you don't know anything. SAM:
 Anika knowing
 complicates things, because if Anika has already told Rachel,
I need to tell Rachel myself. I need your help. Where'd you find it? There's a bunch of knots
around the roots -of those trees
in the back left.
-Okay. -A ton of knots.
-Let's go. SAM:
 Because if Rachel
 finds out from Anika and I'm still lying about it
 to Rachel's face-- bad, bad look for me. RACHEL: Oh, my God. This is crazy. ANDY:
It's only been a few hours since
 I found this Beware Advantage. So, I'm thinking, ""Okay, maybe I should just go for it
 and go get this thing."" For a player like me,
 in this position, an idol would mean
a hell of a lot. And so now I feel like
 it would be optimal for me to go ahead
 and grab this. You know, it is
a ticking time clock. Someone could find it. And so I go
 to my secret hiding spot. I'm thinking I kind of forgot which branch it was on. I see the branch where it was. (groans) It is not there. And I am overcome with a sense of panic. Oh, this is not good. What I thought was
 a safety net is not only gone and out of my hands, but is in the hands
 of somebody else. RACHEL:
Let's go! -There we go.
-Oh, my God. There we go.
We got it. Finally, Rachel and I get to the key to unlock the box. Um, I'm not
feeling good right now. I have to think about things. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. -Okay, let's talk.
-Okay. ANDY:
 Sam-- he is my one foothold to get back into this game. And so my gut is saying I can trust him. So, like, two hours ago, I found but did not take
the Beware Advantage. -You found it?
-Yeah, but I didn't take it. -Oh, you left it?
-Yeah. Didn't want-- I didn't want to lose my vote.
So, I stashed it. SAM:
 I was in musical theater,
 and it's not for my singing. Like, I can act a little bit,
 but I was not ready for the bomb that Andy
was about to drop. SAM:
 He says one of the girls found the Beware Advantage.
Music to my ears, Andy. I think you're right. They're up to no good. They've got something. Damn. -I think it's okay. -ANDY: With Sam, I am telling him this
 valuable information in order to build
the trust I need. I feel kind of bad
because I'm sitting there with the key in my sock. But as silly as Andy might feel losing a Beware Advantage,
 he took a huge leap of faith coming to me
with this information. -I trust you.
-Yeah, dude, I got you, 100%. This is starting
 to make me feel like I can actually trust Andy
moving forward. TK: Now, obviously, us three and Gabe are probably set
to not be gone early. Uh, so, I just want to see w--
if we're really-- if we could gauge this out.
If we were to say right now, if we lose next challenge, who do we think
in this situation we're going? It's, like,
a toss-up between, like... TK:
 Sue and Caroline.
 I just don't think Sue brings anything to the table. Gabe. -I'm moving slow today.
-TK: It's-it's all good.
Take your time, bro. GABE: TK, Kyle, and Tiyana-- I think they all think
 I'm kind of just a quiet guy and I really
haven't found my place, socially, with everybody. We were just trying to figure
out, you know, generally... GABE:
Uh-huh. ...how we were thinking
about the other two. -GABE: Yeah.
-But I don't know. Yeah. I'm down with it. TK:
The-- This is the four, bro. Yeah, yeah.
I'm totally cool with that. They pitched the idea to me
 of ""this is our four,"" and I think that they believe that
I'm in with them. This is our four.
This is our four. But that four is not my four. Caroline and Sue
 are way more attractive to me as alliance partners
 than the other three are. We need to put something
in our stomachs. GABE:
They're on the bottom right now. These are wounded birds,
 and I want to bring these birds in,
 'cause people who feel like they're on the bottom--
they're desperate. Me and Sue are pretty locked in
 as number ones. So, the next wounded bird
I need to go get is Caroline. I think TK and Kyle
are way closer with each other than either of them
are with me, and the only person
I've talked any s-- real strategy with is Sue. I feel like
you're a genuine person. I really want to work with you. You, me and Sue-- -we can run this thing.
-Okay. I have zero
working relationship with Gabe. I just graduated
 from business school. I'm not an idiot. I don't
 believe him for a second. So, I have no trust
in him whatsoever. I want to work with you. -Mm-hmm.
-We have a lot of potential. -Uh-huh. Yeah.
-It's not here yet. But I don't feel like
I have that thing where I can, like...
I don't know. It's just not clicking -Yeah.
-as much as I want it to. GABE:
 I'm surprised by just
how skeptical Caroline is of me. And I know I have to squash
that as soon as I possibly can. So, at that moment,
 I make the call to pull my idol out
 and show her. (mutters) Yeah, that's it. And then he shows me his idol. Hey, good job. -It's huge.
-Thank you. CARLOLINE:
 This is such a weird
 show of trust. So, I actually think maybe there's a world where
Gabe and I can work together. -He told me he has it.
-Yeah? -He has the idol.
-Okay. -He told me, too. Okay.
-Oh, my God. -Okay, okay, okay.
-So... -Interesting.
-Yeah. I want to be cautious, but I'm optimistic. But I-I definitely
think we're good. I mean, I think
as long as me, you and Gabe can stay strong,
we're gonna be okay. Nobody knows that Caroline, myself, and Gabe are in an alliance. And I think that's a big deal. How are you guys feeling? SUE:
I'm-I'm really excited. Yeah. I agree. I like it. I have Sue and Caroline. They're my little birds, right?
 And I'm gonna make 'em warm. I'm gonna make 'em feel
 good and safe. -CAROLINE: How are you
feeling, Gabe?
-Feel good. Feel like I'm in a good place. Yeah, you are.
You are. GABE:

 But TK didn't stop talking the whole time. Bro, Super Bowl was in Vegas last year--
Or this-- this February was in Vegas. And, bro, it was
so many people there, bro. Like, Big Bear is fire, bro.
It's, uh... 'Cause that's why
I like Cali, bro. 'Cause you can
literally get anything... -Influencers, bro.
He's not fighting real fighters.
-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.
-You know what I mean? Like... SUE:
 I'm trying
 not to be annoyed at TK, but two people
 are trying to sleep and he's just talking loud. And it's just that overpowering male dominant -bro energy. -Yeah, just, like, come in and get me
out of there, bro. Like, this has got to be some
backhand strategical move, bro. SUE:
 These bastards,
 they don't even realize that I am somebody
 to begin with. I have the best job ever
out of all of them. I'm a pilot and I'm a--
You know, own a flight school. It's just such
 a lack of respect. And it's just
 very frustrating. I wanted-- I couldn't wait
for them to leave. It's so frustrating.
Just annoying. -Like...
-Yeah, it's so annoying. I can't fall asleep
with people talking. -It just. No, it's impossible.
-Exactly. SUE:
 Tiyana knows I can't stand TK and she agrees with me,
 but I can't tell if she's just
saying that to ""yes"" me or if she believes it. TK is, like,
one of those people that... I don't have
a solid read on him. I wish I got to
sleep in all day. TIYANA:
 I don't think I vibe with him as a person.
But the thing is... (sighs) ...me, TK, Gabe and Kyle-- that four-- we have the numbers.
 And so, I'm game to roll
with the big dogs. -Okay, let's get it. -SAM: So, I tell Sierra I have the key.
 And so, the last step is going and getting this box, unlocking the box, and getting my hidden immunity idol. SIERRA:
Let's go! There's not one part of my body that I'm like, ""I can't
 trust Sam at this point."" And he wants to include me
in everything. That, to me,
 is, like, friggin' cool. -There.
-Got the lock? SIERRA:
It's here. Yep, right here. SAM:
Gonna get it out. (Sierra laughs) I feel like we definitely have this strong
trust now that's truly building. I just wanted to share
 that moment with Sierra as number ones and friends. SAM:
 We run off to the water well
 and we're like, ""Here we go. The moment
you've been waiting for, ""where you get an immunity idol on Survivor."" (Sierra giggling) And we open the box. And there's another box. The idol that
 I've just found is only good for one Tribal Council. I can play it safe
 or I can choose to take on another task and make this idol good for three Tribal Councils. Okay? Let's go! You got it. I decide, ""Let's not get ahead of our skis,""
 and I grab my very own Survivor hidden immunity idol. Yes. It's mine! (laughs) Sorry. SAM:
 And this is a little guy,
 but I feel like this one's gonna
be small but mighty. We can make something happen
at the next one. Yeah, we're good, we're good. SAM:
 But right now I'm trying to figure out how do I use
 this idol to position myself in the best spot possible.
 I'm trying to think a couple of steps ahead. Hear me out. Is it crazy
if I play it on Andy? -I-I hope you can understand
that I'm, like, nervous
-Yeah. -about going to four with
the three girls and myself.
-Okay. Yeah. I think that's the right move. SIERRA:
 I do not love the idea
 of working with Andy. I think he's very unpredictable.
 But if Sam's pulling, you know, Andy's way, I'm sticking with Sam. I think, surprisingly,
Andy has, like, a decent head
on his shoulders right now. Survivor is never
as simple as it seems, and you got to make big moves to advance in this game,
 and I-I think I might be on the cusp of having
to make a really big move. And that's where the fun begins. Sa y go od by e to m ul ti pl e da il y in su li n in je ct io ns and say hello to

Wow. Oh, my God. Huge reactions. Wow. All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge? (all voicing assent) First things first.
Rome, Sue, -got to take it back.
-I ain't taking
a step toward you. -SIERRA: She's hiding.
-Come on, give it up. Don't make me pull out my knife. (laughing) -Spicy.
-Savage. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're gonna jump into the ocean
 and race to a tower where you will retrieve
 a large bag of rice. You're gonna then work together
 to get that bag of rice through a very small hole
 and ashore, where one person
 will stand behind a cage door and maneuver a key
 through a maze. Once you have the key, unlock the door, tear open your bag of rice and retrieve a ball,
 where finally, three tribe members will attempt
 to maneuver that ball through a winding snake track. First two tribes
to finish win immunity. In addition,
you're playing for reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? (all voicing assent) (cheering, applause) -(indistinct chatter)
-Let's go. Let's go. PROBST:
First tribe to finish-- a massive Survivor fishing kit. -(whooping)
-ANIKA: Oh, my God. Second tribe to finish, smaller,
but this will do the job. SAM:
Yeah! -(whooping)
-PROBST: Last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers--
I got nothing for you but a date with me
at Tribal Council where somebody will be the second person voted out
of Survivor 47. As a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint. Gata, you are working
to get yours back. All right, we have sit-outs. Lavo, you have one extra person.
Sitting somebody out. You cannot sit out
the same person in back-to-back challenges.
Who's it gonna be? -It's gonna be Aysha.
-PROBST: Aysha. -Tuku, who's it gonna be?
-Me. PROBST:
Sue. All right,
we have our sit-outs. Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize. We'll get it on. Let's do it. -(cheering)
-Go, guys. (whoops) PROBST:
All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! -Everybody in the water at once.
-SUE: Go, Tuku! PROBST:
Your first job is
to get that very heavy bag of rice down from the platform. AYSHA:
Go, Lavo! PROBST:
Tuku heads up first. There goes Gata. Andy's got it. Rome has it for Lavo. Ready? It's heavy. Don't drop it. PROBST:
Tiyana and TK have it for Tuku. Put the weight on my head. -I got it, I got it, I got it.
-You got it? PROBST:
It's Lavo in the early lead now
with their bag of rice. I got rough footing out here. PROBST:
You got to get everybody
to that next obstacle -before you can start over.
-AYSHA: Come on, Lavo! Lavo, you're good. -We're good, we're good.
-Gata, you're good. Tuku, you're good. The rice is going
through the hole. The players are going
over the obstacle. PROBST:
Lavo working quickly
with that bag of rice. -Here we go.
-Yup, back and forth. AYSHA:
Good job, let's go! -You can drop. You can drop.
-PROBST: Rome, going for style points. -You good?
-PROBST: Lavo has their
bag of rice through very fast. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! PROBST:
Gata has their bag of rice. They're heading out. -Nice. Here we go.
-Yup. PROBST:
Tuku has their bag of rice. They're heading over
and through. (grunting) PROBST:
You got to get everybody to the mat
before you can move on. You got it, you got it, Andy. You're good, Lavo.
It's gonna be Rome on the maze. Here comes Gata.
Rachel's got to get there. You're good, Gata. -You guys are great.
-PROBST: You're good, Tuku. It's gonna be Tiyana for Tuku, Rome for Lavo, Rachel for Gata. You guys are great. PROBST:
You're doing this blind. You're trying to find the hole and then get the key
through hole. KYLE:
Make a grid with your mind. PROBST:
You don't know
if you're making progress until you get there. GENEVIEVE:
Good job, Rome. -We got your back.
You're doing great.
-Go, Rome! PROBST:
You'll know
when you hit a dead end. PROBST:
It's much more difficult
when you are blind. SUE:
Come on, Tiyana! Let's go! -Oh!
-PROBST: Rachel has it,
drops her key. SAM:
You got it. You got it,
you got it. PROBST:
Now you can unlock. PROBST:
Now Gata-- they have their key. PROBST:
Now Rome feeling the pressure, Tiyana feeling the pressure. Wait, wait.
Keep going, keep going. PROBST:
Rachel has the door open. Drop that bag on the table. Andy has the rice. Gonna use
that knife. Watch your hands! -Yeah, like the coconut.
-Just like that coconut. -Yeah, baby. Go!
-(whooping) -Tear it open.
-SIERRA: Rip it
like that coconut. PROBST:
Andy now looking for that ball. -Rome has it for Lavo!
-Yes! He can unlock that door. It's
now Tiyana who's gonna feel it. -Yes!
-Andy has the ball. It is Gata in the lead, something they are definitely
not used to. -Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: I don't know what that means, but it sounds great. -Ah! Ah!
-(whooping) -PROBST: Rome has the door open.
-Come on! Drop that bag on the table. PROBST:
Tiyana still working for Tuku. Come on, Tiyana! -SIERRA: Don't stress.
-SAM: All right. -We ready?
-PROBST: Sierra, Sam and Anika. And this will take a lot
of teamwork and a lot of communication. It's a very delicate move
you're trying to make as you guide that ball
along this winding track. There is a massive
learning curve to this challenge because it requires all
three players to work together. There are a lot of bogeys. Those holes
you've got to get around. Don't overdo it there.
We want it to stop right here. PROBST:
Looking for that ball.
He's got it. It's gonna be Genevieve,
Rome and Kishan. Yes. Tiyana finally has the key
for Tuku. Tuku is through. -Let's go, guys!
-AYSHA: All right,
let's go! Let's go! PROBST:
Kyle gonna open that bag. -I'm going.
-PROBST: Gata working slowly
on their table. ANIKA:
We're learning. I want to eat this. Yeah, me, too.
I was just thinking. PROBST:
Kyle looking for that ball now.
He's got it. Gonna be TK,
Gabe and Kyle for Tuku. AYSHA:
You got this, Lavo! PROBST:
Lavo drops.
They got to start over. -Let's go on the other side.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. It is a blistering hot day. You're already exhausted. But it comes down to this--
one little ball, a windy little path, and victory
awaiting you at the end. It is Gata in the lead. Keep it taut. PROBST:
But Tuku is now catching Gata. I'm going pressure, you're
giving finesse right now. Nice guide, bro. Nice guide.
We got it. Easy work. PROBST:
A little tension,
a little slack. You need more, I give you some. I need some, you got to let go. Guide it at your pace. -You're good.
-SIERRA: Am I giving slack? Yeah. Yup. Stop when we get
right before the hole. ANIKA:
Stopping. Sierra, you're calling out
which one's thicker. SIERRA:
Well, my side. Wait. No. -Left side, left side.
-SAM: Anika's side, okay. So both of you pull,
get it to the end. -Let me get this
to the edge.
-ANIKA: Yup. When you figure out
how to work together on this, it becomes very easy. SAM:
Keep going, Si. PROBST:
Lavo moving very slowly now, trying to learn
from their mistakes. -GENEVIEVE: Okay?
-ROME: We're good,
we're good, we're good. But we are absolutely
neck-and-neck now with Gata and Tuku
at the same spot, same obstacle. -Little bit more, Gabe.
Give it a little bit.
-Yup, yup. -Stop, stop, stop, stop!
-PROBST: Tuku can't navigate it. That's how fast
this challenge can change. -Somebody pull. Watch it.
-PROBST: It is Gata in the lead. -I'm pulling as much as I can.
-Calm down. Stop! Hey, stop! All right? -What are we doing? Let's go.
-PROBST: Gata starting to panic. ANIKA:
Okay, well, I mean,
I can't pull. Choke up on the rope.
You have more rope. Sam, Sam, if I pull it
any further, it won't go. -Please listen to me.
-SAM: All right. All right. PROBST:
Tuku moving quickly now, trying to catch Lavo.
They can feel the pressure, but somebody's gonna be last.
Somebody's going to Tribal. -Slack, lot of it.
-PROBST: Gata is very close to finishing this challenge. There is one spot left. -No!
-I can't pull anymore. PROBST:
Gata at the last spot. One hole. Can they get past it and drop for the win? SAM:
Yeah. Watch it. Watch it. PROBST:
Very close. -Oh, my God.
-We're good. Stop. Stop. And they got it!
Gata wins immunity! Safe from Tribal Council.
We're looking for one more. And right now, it is Lavo
decidedly ahead of Tuku. -Keep the ring left.
-PROBST: They have got to move or hope that Lavo -makes a mistake.
-Very gentle. -ROME:
All right, all right, all right.
-Nice move by Lavo. AYSHA:
Nice recovery. Let's go! That is not gonna fall
through. We just need to... Wait, wait, wait, fellas. Wait. PROBST:
Tuku has dropped
and has to start again. Now Tuku can feel the panic. GABE:
I'm telling everybody. -Slow.
-PROBST: This is it. It comes down
to this moment right here. ROME:
Okay, that's good. That's good. They're on the edge, and they're past it.
Can they drop it for the win? GENEVIEVE:
Yup. Got it. They do! Lavo wins immunity... (cheering) ...sending Tuku
to Tribal Council where somebody will be the second person
voted out of Survivor 47. Yeah! All right, Gata, -immunity is yours.
-(whooping, cheering) And you earn your flint back. -Yes!
-Yes! Gata safe tonight,
no Tribal Council. I will miss you at Tribal. -I know you won't miss me.
-We won't miss you, Jeff.
-Promise. I don't take it personally.
Lavo, congratulations. For the second straight time,
immunity is yours. Well done.
All right, Gata, before I send you out,
I have a question for Rachel. -Yes?
-Did I see you putting some rice... in your pocket? You didn't see anything, Jeff. PROBST:
Unbelievable. Empty your pockets. -Okay. Sorry.
-SAM: You put rice
in your pocket? SIERRA:
Dude, what a savage! -(Sierra shrieks)
-(laughter) ROME:
Oh, my-- -SIERRA: It's in your pockets?
-RACHEL: Yeah. SIERRA: Well, we were
trying to play smart. -ROME: Oh, my God.
-Yeah, you got to empty 'em. Hey, when I was standing
at that bag of rice, I thought, ""Maybe I can
take some home with us."" I respect the try. -Thank you.
-PROBST: Lavo, Gata,
grab your stuff. -(whooping)
-Head back to camp.
No Tribal Council tonight. SOL:
Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. That was funny. -Yeah.
-PROBST: That's a first, Rachel. -(laughing)
-Hey. All right, Tuku. So, Tiyana,
I see a lot of smiles. -It's fake.
-(laughing) I'm trying my best
to keep positive, you know? I mean, obviously we lost, so we got to stay positive and
figure something out, you know? So, it's tough. TK, now you enter the last part
of the game, the biggest part of the game, when you go to Tribal,
and you vote somebody out. You haven't had
to deal with that yet. Can you anticipate
what's gonna be different as you head back to camp? Uh, I mean, honestly, I'm
genuinely pissed off right now, so it's hard for me to even
think that far right now. I'm just... We got way too many
smiles over here for us to lose. I'm just not used to losing.
I don't hang with people who are cool
with losing. I don't... I don't even associate myself
with that. If I lose,
I'm not gonna be happy about it. And, uh, I just want
to make sure that I have a tribe
that has the same mindset, and if we don't,
then that's a problem. All right, Tuku,
Tribal Council tonight, where one of you will be
the second person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing--
sorry for you-- I'm gonna take your flint. Thank you. You will have a chance
to earn this back at your next challenge.
All right, grab your stuff. Head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. SUE: TK threw Tiyana
 under the bus because he was angry
that she was smiling. Before today's challenge, I always thought
 she was with the boys, but the rage on her face
 and the anger just showed that she was so upset with TK,
 and hopefully, that put the nail
in the coffin for him. Un it ed He al th ca re k no ws you've got your whole life

 Oh, dude, please tell me
 we have some. -Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, okay. -(Sue sighs)
-Yeah. GABE: At the challenge, I saw Tiyana rolling her eyes at everything that TK said, and that changed things a lot for me.
Because, initially, I felt like the lines
were pretty clear in the sand. And on one side
of the equation, it was me, Sue and Caroline,
and nobody really knew about it. And on the other side
 of the equation, it was TK, Kyle and Tiyana. And I thought Tiyana was in
 really tight with the guys. I hope you guys didn't think
I was like, -""Yay. Can't wait.""
-I can't-I can't-- No. I cannot stress enough
how nobody thought that. But I think that what happened at the challenge today
 really put her in an emotional state that is gonna guide
 her decision-making tonight. And if that plays in my favor, then I am all for it. TK: Playing sports my... majority of my life--
 it really just builds this mindset in you
that, like, you don't put all this work in
to go out and lose. For me, man, I just... I don't
 really do well with losing. We got a tribe that should win
every single challenge, and we're not doing it. I feel like
 I'm a leader on the tribe, and if y'all gonna be
 on my tribe, everybody needs to have
the same mindset that I have. So now, I'm gonna start
telling people what we're doing. ""This is the goal, this
 is the plan, let's execute."" TIYANA:
 I'm not gonna lie. When TK popped off-- like, that hurt,
and not just because... (mockingly): I'm a dramatic
little woman. I... Like, he basically stood,
like, on his high horse and called us all losers. Even if I lose a ballgame, I walk out on the field
and I slap hands with people, -and I'm like, ""Hey, good game.""
-Yeah. Like, the sportsmanship. -Like, for real.
-KYLE: Yeah. Y'all talking ... about me? -No.
-No. TIYANA: The fact that TK
couldn't take any accountability for the loss as a team-- that pissed me off. T was a little rubbed off
that you didn't apologize to her right away. Like, that kind of, like,
ruffled some feathers. Bruh, I don't owe her an
apology, but I don't know, bruh. Like, now I'm starting
to not trust T. KYLE:
 Tiyana was not
 feeling the respect from TK, and, uh, I think that he should
 have apologized to her. But TK, Tiyana, myself-- they're my ride-or-dies. So, I'm trying
 to keep that together. I just got to make sure
T's not gonna ... this up. Let me get us together. Maybe
we can straighten that out. And it's-it's... The strategy talks-- that's
the hardest part of this for me. I can hang out in the jungle. A country boy can survive.
I'm not worried about it. Hank Williams said it best. But this is the first time that my wheels really had
 to be spinning like this. If you have an issue
with anything that I say, -please come to me
and talk to me about it.
-Mm-hmm. Like, I don't need you going
around the circle to tell me, like, that you feel
a certain type of way. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Talk to me about it. At the end of the day,
I didn't even see who smiled on the tribe,
so nothing was pointed at you, him, anybody. Jeff said, ""Damn, Tuku.
You guys are smiling. You're going to Tribal tonight."" -And that's what triggered you?
-And I said, ""I'm not comfortable
with anybody smiling right now."" But that being said,
are we straight? -Uh, yes.
-All right. TIYANA:
 When I came out here,
 I knew that I wanted to be a player that separated emotion
from gameplay. I could not like you,
but I could work with you. And I'm...
and then, I'm just like, ""No."" TIYANA:
 But it's very, very difficult
 because right now, I'm getting a little bit annoyed
 at TK with his ego. However, strategically, he is a great physical asset
 to have in these challenges. And I know that I have to
sometimes put the emotions aside if I want
to get farther in the game. -I just want to make sure
we're all good.
-KYLE: All right. -Yup. No. Ser...
-Love you. Love you. -We're straight. We're solid.
-So... We're gonna
stick to the same plan. Sue: done. TIYANA:
 I do believe that Sue,
 right now, is one of the weaker members
 of the tribe because she can't
 really contribute to physical challenges, and it kind of seems like
she's fizzling out on day five. -I'm good for it.
-TK: I think we stick with Sue. -So we stick with Sue? I'm game.
-And that'd be the end of it. TK:
 Sue needs to go home. It's not a hard decision
 because Sue doesn't really bring anything
 specifically to the tribe. So, think my game plan
is working flawlessly right now. I think that's
the only way we can play. Myself, Tiyana and Kyle--
 locked in. And Gabe will do
 whatever I need him to do. So, the way that I'm moving these chess pieces around, everybody else

quite a blindside. If we can pull it off. I'm praying to God you do not
need to play your idol tonight. I could play the idol for Sue, but the thing with Tiyana
 has changed things a lot. -This is... Yeah. She's four.
-Okay. Yeah. Yes. 100%. And I think if we can lock
Tiyana in as a fourth right now, I don't see any reason
 to use my idol tonight. I will have
a ... conversation with her. That's what I was gonna say. You don't know I... Yeah. I will absolutely be like-- -Whatever you got to say
to make it happen.
-Okay. All right. Let's go, guys.
We rock. CAROLINE: Tonight, I really hope
 Tiyana's on our side, because if we go to a tie,
and you can't convince anyone to change their votes,
you go to rocks. And the two people the
 entire tribe wants gone most-- they're safe. And the odds of the people who are drawing rocks--
25% chance you go home. It's really risky. -I trust you all wholeheartedly.
-Oh. Yeah, even if it's a tie. Well, that-that would have
to put Tiyana, and she's gonna know if she has
to ... change her vote. All of us have the balls
 to go to rocks. I'm a risk-taker, and I am not gonna cow down to anything. I'm gonna go all out. I don't want anybody to know
we've been a threesome, 'cause then she'll know
we've been lying to her. -Good.
-So she's gonna think
it's us girls. Tiyana doesn't know
 that Caroline, myself and Gabe are in an alliance,
 so the only thing that's gonna have to happen is Tiyana's gonna
 have to jump ship. I feel like, you know,
I understand -if you don't want to do TK.
-No. But I feel he-- Taking out the
biggest threat would be sick. You... Yeah, it would,
and it would... -Be epic.
-It would...
No, it would be epic. -Like, we just need the numbers.
-Yeah. How else are we supposed
to flip this? -Yeah.
-Like, then what--
we go to rocks? -I will go to rocks.
-Yeah. Sue wants TK
 to be the next vote. Honestly, it'd be
a ep-epic boss girl move. TIYANA: However, TK and Kyle are really, really,
 really close, so, that's a big problem if it comes into blindsiding TK,
'cause I'm also blindsiding Kyle,
 and I don't know how I could rebuild
 that relationship. It's really taking a toll. Yeah. As long
as us three stay together. It's all about if we think
Tiyana will go to rocks or not. I don't think she will. TIYANA:
 It is really difficult
 being in the middle because it does feel like a lot of pressure on my shoulders
to deliver to people that have put their faith in me. (groans)
This waiting. That's the worst part, honestly.
Waiting around. TIYANA:
 It would absolutely
 make sense for me to vote Sue tonight because TK has strength on his side,
 but I don't want to work with someone
who I feel disrespected me. So, it really is this toss-up between emotion and strategy. I can only hope
 that my gut is right, and that I'm trusting
 the right people in this game. No th in g co me s cl os e to t hi s pl ac e in t he m or ni ng . I'm so glad
I can still come here. You see, I was diagnosed
with obstructive HCM. And there were some days
I was so short of breath. I thought I'd have
to settle for never stepping foot on
this trail again. I became great
at making excuses. But I have people
who count on me so I talked to my
cardiologist. I said there must be more
we can do for my symptoms. He told me about a medication
called CAMZYOS. He said CAMZYOS works
by targeting what's causing
my obstructive HCM. So he prescribed it and I'm really
glad he did. CAMZYOS is used
 to treat adults with symptomatic
 obstructive HCM. CAMZYOS may improve
 your symptoms and your ability
 to be active. CAMZYOS may cause serious
 side effects, including heart failure
 that can lead to death. A risk that's increased
 if you develop a serious infection
 or irregular heartbeat or when taking certain
 other medicines. So do not stop, start or
 change medicines or the dose without telling
 your healthcare provider. You must have
 echocardiograms before and
 during treatment. Seek help if
 you experience new or worsening
 symptoms of heart failure. Because of this risk,
 CAMZYOS is only available through a
 restricted program. Before taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor about all
 of your medical conditions, including current
 or planned pregnancy. Today with CAMZYOS, I don't
lose my breath as often. My symptoms have improved, helping me go from
expecting less to experiencing more. My name is Mike. And this is my
CAMZYOS moment. Call your
cardiologist today and see if a
CAMZYOS moment may be in
your future too. Ok , 50 0 de lu xe g ar de n gn om es . Wo w. I only meant to order five. There's not enough money
in my account for these. I'm gonna get charged. Two things I just
can't deal with. Overdraft charges.
And garden gnomes. But your BMO Smart Advantage
Checking account gives you an extra day
to avoid an overdraft fee. Nice to see a bank
cutting people some slack. Mistakes happen. And we give you time
to correct them. So, you don't like gnomes huh?
What about that one? That one I like.
A lot. ♪ BMO ♪ ♪ ♪ (chuckling) Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch,
dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council, because in this game,
fire represents your life. When your fire's gone,
so are you. That's gonna be the case for one of the six
of you tonight. So, let's get into
these first few days. Sue, did you see
any natural pairing? It often happens when you have
a group of strangers that you say, ""Oh, I'm from
that part of the country"" or ""I'm the mom, too.""
Did you see any of that? What I actually saw
was a bromance developing, and I felt like
from the very beginning, there were, like, the three guys and the three girls
on the bottom. -Really?
-Yeah. PROBST:
Tiyana, do you agree with that? I honestly do agree. It seemed like
they vibed really well. But also, this is Survivor. Nothing's ever so cookie-cutter.
""Oh, boys and girls."" -Right.
-So, I really do think that what once started
as a bromance maybe possibly could be split.
We never know. PROBST:
So, let me just check
with the three guys. Do you agree with that?
Did you all feel like -you just bonded quickly?
-Oh, yeah. -I mean...
-I... I bonded pretty quickly
with them. but I also bonded
with some girls, as well. I'm not strictly on a bromance
or a romance or nothing. PROBST:
TK, one thing Sue said very clearly was,
the men were on top, and the women were
on the bottom. She didn't say it was even in her view. TK:
I think what a lot of that had to do with is maybe she wasn't
as comfortable initiating conversation like the guys were. If you're kind of just
in your own bubble, that can make you feel that way. So, Sue, that's
very much your problem. That's not my problem
whatsoever. I can socialize and be very good
with men as well as women. There was a line,
and you could tell, you know,
they wanted to stay strong. TK:
I just got a question. Has anybody really talked to Sue
more than two or three times as far as, like,
deep conversation? -Have you?
-I've tried. I mean, we've tried to have
conversations. I'm just saying. I'm just asking the question,
like, how much did you actually initiate conversation
with everyone else? That's the things that
you have to do on Survivor, is you have
to have those conversations. And if you're not, we all know
by watching the game, things can change. Gabe, it can't
surprise you that, already, there's this division
or misunderstanding or whatever
it might ultimately be. That's part of the design
of this game. You take a group of strangers
and you thrust them into crisis and say, ""Figure it out."" Yeah. I think that
in the game of Survivor, there's two kinds of
relationships you have, right? There are your
strategic relationships and there are
your social relationships. And I think that people,
especially in early days, they see social relationships,
and they immediately associate them
with strategic relationships. But those two things
aren't always the same thing. PROBST:
Caroline, is there
a stated philosophy with this tribe when it comes to searching
for idols or advantages? There's really only one person
I can think of who is known as the person for, like,
you can tell what they're doing. -So...
-PROBST: You're all smiling. Do you know
who Caroline's talking about? -Yeah.
-Yes.
-PROBST: Who is it? -Gabe.
-Ooh. So, Gabe, is this a surprise
that they are onto you? GABE:
I mean, look, the game says, ""Here's
an island, and it's yours."" And this is an opportunity
to be a kid again. And I like to Tarzan around
a little bit, and, you know,
I'm not blind to the fact that that's gonna
raise eyebrows, but I want to be Indiana Jones
for a little bit. Let me be Indiana Jones.
Come on. PROBST:
Gabe, your enthusiasm for that, to me, is the hallmark
of a new era player. You all tend to wear your hearts
on your sleeves. You're more passionate. We had it with you today, TK. It was different. You were
frustrated about the challenge. So, did you have an intention when you said, ""I want people
to know I'm not happy""? Absolutely. I think the whole
goal of me even speaking out wasn't to single any one person
out on the tribe, but more to get
everybody's attention to reinforce the fact that we should not
be okay with losing. And we need to understand that
we want to win, we need to go as hard
as we can go and not be happy
with being last place and not be complacent
with being last place, especially for the fact that
somebody's going home tonight because we didn't win. (thunder rumbles) PROBST:
So, Tiyana, tonight's vote is the first test of trust. Did you find yourself needing
a little more reassurance? TIYANA:
Oh, absolutely.
And kind of going back to balancing
social and strategic, it's like,
""Oh, do I like this person ""and I kind of trust them
for them just being themselves, ""or do I trust them
on a strategy level of, like, playing
this game with me?"" So, at this point, I'm like, how
will the chips fall? You know? So, moving forward in this game, I need to work with people
that I can genuinely trust. But also, you never
actually know who you can trust until whoever's
torch is getting snuffed is getting snuffed. And on that note,
it is time to vote. Caroline, you're up. ♪ ♪ Want to see a magic trick? In one fell swoop, I will make
your Survivor dream... disappear. I'll go tally the votes. ♪ ♪ If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. GABE:
Yeah. PROBST: Okay. Playing this for yourself? Yeah. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast
against Gabe will not count. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sue. TK.
One vote Sue, one vote TK. Sue.
Two votes Sue, one vote TK. TK.
We're tied. Two votes Sue, two votes TK. TK. -Hmm.
-That's three votes TK,
two votes Sue, one vote left. Second person voted out

-Wow. PROBST:
Need to bring me your torch. -Good stuff.
-Sorry, TK. No worries.
No worries. (TK groans) TK:

47,14,The Last Stand,"Welcome to the final episode
of Survivor 47. It's been a wild ride
these last few days, starting with Operation Italy. That took out Caroline
and flipped the game. And that sent Rachel
into stealth mode, literally crawling
through the sand like a spy to listen in on Sam and Andy and Genevieve and Teeny as they plotted her demise. So, armed with that knowledge, she made the biggest move
of the season. Played her Block a Vote
and her idol, took out Andy in a revenge vote,
flipped the game again. Then Rachel won her third
individual immunity challenge and used that leverage
to take out Genevieve. And now we're down to four: Rachel, Sue, Teeny and Sam. Two of them are gonna
sit right here. The other two
will be forced to make fire to earn that third spot. Then the final three will
face their jury and get a chance to plead their case about
why they deserve the title of Sole Survivor and the million
dollars that comes with it. And then we will crown a winner
of Survivor 47. And immediately following that,
we're gonna stay right here in this beautiful Tribal Council
and do the aftershow. It is a very big night
for Survivor. It's the finale of Survivor 47. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... I find out so much. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. I trust her.
 She shared so much with me. My loyalty to Rachel is real. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it... Jeff? I'd like to play it for myself. First vote: Rachel.
Does not count. Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member
of our jury: Andy. The tribe has spoken. All eyes on Rachel right now.
Does she have it? -Good girl.
-And she does. It's over! Rachel has won her third individual immunity. RACHEL:
 Oh, my God. I won immunity
when I needed it so bad. I've never felt more confident
that I'm less confident in what's going to happen. Genevieve just
spun me around in circles, and I'm sick of it. Fourteenth person voted out and the seventh member
of our jury: Genevieve. The tribe has spoken. They have. ♪ ♪ -TEENY: Final four.
-Oh, my God. Final four, guys. TEENY:
 I am ecstatic. I'm in the final four
of Survivor-- my dream of all time. -We did it!
-Come on! Final four! -Final four.
-Final four. TEENY:
 And I am one round away from having a chance
to pitch my case to win. Genevieve is gone.
I just want to say -It's so crazy.
-congrats to all of us. -I know.
-That girl was a legend. And Genevieve is gone. So, right now, I am riding the highest high of my entire 23 years of life. TEENY:
There were...
How many people have we beaten? -Fourteen.
-How did that happen? My daughter Chelsea's
 last text to me was, ""Mom, I want you to know, ""if you get voted out
the first day, we're still so proud of you."" And now I'm here
in the final four. (laughs) -You guys, final four.
-RACHEL: Final four. SUE:
 It's the craziest thing, and I want to scream
 at the top of my lungs. Ah! Sam, we got to final four and we never
wrote each other's name down. -Yeah. How about that?
-I'm pretty proud of us. SAM: I'm at the final four
 of Survivor, and it's this weird, like, hybrid
of being fulfilled and being motivated. -How you feeling, Sam?
-Feeling like, uh... big day tomorrow. Because my dream was not
 to come on Survivor and get fourth place. My dream was
 to be the Sole Survivor, and I really feel like
I'm one day away. We're gonna wake up
on day 25 on Survivor. What a concept. Tonight I'm just, like, happy and feel
in a celebratory mood and just, like,
want to kind of take it all in. The last few votes,
 I've had to win to survive, and I'm not gonna stop competing now. I feel like this
 immunity challenge coming up is the last stand,
 the final battle for the four of us, and it's the most important
 of them all. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on in! What in the world? PROBST:
Take it in. This is what stands between you
and a million dollars. Four big smiles. They're nervous smiles, Jeff. Yeah, they're scared smiles. They should be. Wow. So, here we are, day 25. You've made it
to the final four. You have one
immunity challenge left. Shall we just get to it? -(all voicing assent)
-All right. First things first, Rachel. For the third time, got to take back the necklace. -Thank you.
-RACHEL: Thank you. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna crawl under a muddy net. You'll then use a long pole
 to unweave a rope. Once you have that rope, you'll use it to lower a gate. You'll run through it and
 collect a bag of letter tiles. You'll need those tiles
 to solve a combination lock. That'll release a machete. You'll use the machete
 to drop the ladder, climb to the finish
 where you will race to solve a hanging bat puzzle. First person
to finish wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot
in the final three. You will be
at that Final Tribal Council, where you will get a chance
to plead your case to your jury about why you deserve the title
of Sole Survivor and the million dollars
that comes with it. You also have power
because you decide who sits next to you
in that second spot and who you force to make fire
to earn that final spot. Which means one of the four of
you will be forced to make fire and you're gonna lose and your dream is gonna fall one day short. Only way to prevent that
from happening: win right now. Yeah. PROBST:
Biggest challenge of the season. We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. All right, here we go. For immunity, guaranteed spot
in the final three, Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going
back through mud again. -(grunting)
-Day 25, Survivor 47. -You want it,
-(grunting) this is where you step up -and grab it.
-(grunts) Sam through, Rachel's through,
Teeny's through. Come on, Sue! Let's dig! (grunting) PROBST: Now you're gonna untie a long pole and use it
to unweave a rope. You need that rope. Sam has his pole. That pole has
a little bit of a U. You can use that U
to grab that rope and push it up
and over those pegs. It is Sam in the early lead. Rachel's starting
to get the hang of it. Teeny doing a nice job. Sue has her first bit of rope. Sam figuring it out. Once you're there,
knock off the ball. Sam has his. Now you got to untie more knots,
get through that little gate. Rachel has hers. It is Sam and Rachel. You should be used
to these knots by now. They are a staple on Survivor. Sam is through his knots. Rachel's through hers. Sam and Rachel pulling ahead. Gonna use that ball
to try to lower the gate. Sam almost does it
with his first shot. Rachel just misses. Here comes Teeny working
on her knots. Sue working on her knots. You got to figure out the slack, 'cause you need that ball
to travel. -Ah.
-PROBST: Sam's a little short. -(grunting)
-PROBST: Here comes
Teeny and Sue. Everybody in this. -Sue launches. No.
-Aah! -(grunts)
-Teeny launches. PROBST:
Rachel has a shot if she can get it to come down. Close. Will it work? Rachel's done it!
She's through first! (grunts) Rachel now working
on her letter tiles. It is Rachel in the lead. Big immunity on the line. Everybody fighting right now. Gonna use the letter tiles, try
to solve that combination lock. -Aah!
-Sam still trying
to lower his gate. -(grunts)
-Teeny's still working
on her gate. Sue working on her gate. Sue... lowers her gate. Let's go, Sue! -(grunts)
-PROBST: Sue falling through. That's 25 days
of exhaustion on Survivor. Rachel still in the lead. You've got letter tiles
to help you solve this. You've got a clue. Teeny and Sam still struggling. Now is when
you really feel that pressure. (grunts) PROBST:
Teeny drops her gate. Teeny now working
on the letter tiles. Here goes Sam. Sam very close.
Can he get it to drop? Sam has his gate!
You're through. We got a challenge! Got a clue,
you've got letter tiles. You're trying
to solve that one word. Sam quickly gets
his letter tiles. Everybody now
on the combination lock. It's a word this time,
not numbers. It's what you need to do now. Sam thinks he has it. And he does.
Sam got it very fast. Covers his word up
so nobody can see it. Sam, with one swat,
knocks down his ladder. Rachel has it. Does not cover it... -Ah!
-PROBST: ...leaving it open. Now Rachel's gonna cover it. Sam heading up
to work on that bat puzzle. Rachel drops hers.
Got to get through the knots. Teeny solved it. It is Sam in the lead. Rachel now heading up
her ladder. Teeny trying to drop her ladder. PROBST:
Sue has the word. Still taking her a while
to get it. She's got it now. Rachel now joins Sam. -(Teeny grunts)
-PROBST: Sue will be
up here soon. Teeny's now trying
to drop her ladder. Still working with that machete. Sam did it in one swat. Sue has hers.
She's heading up. -Let's go, Teeny!
-(grunts) Here comes Sue. Sam with another piece
on this bat puzzle. PROBST: It would be Sam's first individual immunity win
of the season. Rachel's at three. Teeny drops hers!
Everybody's still in this. One piece at a time. Sam with another piece. Here comes Teeny. Sue is quickly
getting into this puzzle. Sue has won
one individual immunity. Teeny has not won. Sam has not won. We know Rachel's story.
She's trying to tie a record. Four women have won
four immunity challenges, but Sam is ripping
through this early. Puzzles have not
been his friend so far, but today might be
a different story. Teeny looking for another piece. Sue trying to find one. It is Rachel and Sam right now
side by side and very close. Rachel with another piece. Sam looking
to place another piece. Will it fit? No! Rachel with another piece. And another. Now Rachel in the lead over Sam. Sue is in it, down on the end. Teeny's in it. Teeny, just gonna go right next
door. ""I'm just gonna look."" Now Sam's doing the same thing. No pride on Survivor. What that means is
you're looking at somebody else's puzzle. That means you are trailing. Rachel with another piece. Rachel starting
to pull away now. There have been over 350 woman
that have played Survivor over 46 seasons. Only four have won
four immunity challenges. Rachel down to three pieces. Rachel down to two pieces. Rachel down to her last piece. Rachel thinks she has it. She does not. Something is not right. This challenge is still alive. That is opening the door
for everybody else. What is it? Puzzles look right
when they are finished. Your life in the game is
on the line right now. Keep fighting. Rachel making a switch. Is that it? That's it!
Rachel's done it! Claims a spot in the final three and in the Survivor hall of fame. Wow, what a final challenge. Rachel, come on over. For the fourth
and historic time, immunity is yours. You're in a very
elite group now. Only five women--
including yourself-- over 46 seasons have won
four individual immunities. The biggest thing
is you are guaranteed a spot in the final three.
So, what is the feeling, knowing you accomplished the goal,
you made it to the end? I don't have words
right now, Jeff. I mean, to be standing here
with this necklace on-- it's overwhelming
and it's incredible. And yet, at the same time,
in my gut, I, like, knew I could do this. And I just think that, like,
everything I do in life, I do with
incredible determination. And I didn't know
if I could do it out here, and I'm so proud that I-I have. -Congratulations.
-Thank you. So, tonight at Tribal,
you have a lot of power 'cause you're gonna decide, between Sam, Teeny and Sue, who you put in that second seat
at the final three and which two players you force
to make fire to earn it. You have the afternoon
to figure out what you're gonna do
with that big decision. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council for the final
fire-making showdown. -Congrats.
-Thank you. SAM: Rachel wins
 immunity yet again, and I feel defeated. I've tried
 to knock her out of this game, I've tried to beat her
 at a challenge, but my plan has been foiled. And I know pretty much
 immediately I'm making fire
for my life tonight. ♪ ♪ TEENY: Ooh. (mutters) RACHEL:
 The feeling right now is a little bit of disbelief that this is where I am
right now in this game. You're forever
in the hall of fame. It's... I'm so proud of you. -Thank you.
-Yeah. That was kick-ass. RACHEL:
 I've tied an immunity record. It never occurred to me
that I could win four. -Well, I'm gonna go wash off.
-I'm gonna go wash off, too. RACHEL:
 And so, the fact that I'm tying Jenna Morasca, Chrissy Hofbeck, Kim Spradlin and Kelly Wiglesworth-- that's so cool.
But it also reminds me that
 Kelly and Chrissy didn't win, and they both got to the end. And so, I have to make
 the right decision tonight when it comes to fire-making
 so that I set myself up to truly clinch this win. -I need to go under.
-RACHEL: Yeah, me too. Let's just do it, okay? Yeah. I mean,
I can just tell you. Like, you two are going to fire.
I'm not gonna, like, hold a... No, I know,
I know, I know, I know. RACHEL:
 Sue has been the only loyal ally I've had in this late stage
 of the game, and this wouldn't feel right
without her sitting next to me in the final three. After tonight, one of us
will no longer be in the game. RACHEL:
 And the person I know that I want
 in fire tonight is Sam. He is someone
 that I've been trying to get out for a long time,
 and I think I could put myself into fire
if I needed to. And I was prepared,
if I lost the challenge, that I was
going to fire tonight. But I think that when I take a step back
 and I look at my game, I don't think that knocking
 Sam out directly is going to elevate me
 in any substantial way. And Teeny could be a formidable, like, opponent to Sam. You're gonna let me make fire? -Yeah.
-All right. -I'm down.
-I'm down, too.
I have no choice. Like, you don't need
to be like that. -Like what?
-Arrogant. I'm not arrogant. ""You're gonna let me make fire?"" My worst-case scenario
 was Rachel winning because I knew that she would
put me and Sam into fire-making. I've been threatened by Sam since before we even met
out here on this island, in the sense
that he's super smart, he's charismatic, and he knows this game
 like the back of his hand. And a part of this game is fire. -Shut up!
-I swear, I've never
made a fire once. -RACHEL: You've never
sparked the flint?
-No. -I don't want
to hear from you until tonight.
-It's okay. TEENY:
 Sam is telling us, you know,
 he never practiced fire. But in my mind, it's all a ruse
to try and get in my head. All right, well,
I need to practice. It's a shame
I don't know how to make fire. I'm leaving. TEENY:
 I'm just sick of Sam. And the last thing
 I need right now, when I'm about
to compete against him in such
a high-pressure situation, is him pulling these mind games
yet again on me. You just want the, like,
best shavings possible. Hold your knife like this. And then put the knife
on the... like, here. -(knife scraping)
-Yeah. I see what you mean.
I think I'm getting it. RACHEL:
 I want Teeny sitting with me
 in the final three. And so, I'm like,
""I will help you, Teeny."" You're, like, sparking really
well, and you got flame. Okay. Teeny needed a little bit
of encouragement, and she needed a little bit
 of technique change, and she's killing it. Okay. I hope Sam doesn't know
what he's doing. -I hope Sam doesn't know
what he's doing.
-Me too. Just go slow. -Thank God that
 Sam sucks at doing fire. -(groans) SUE: We all thought
 Sam was lying to us, that he actually
 has been practicing fire, and that he was gonna be good. He's not good.
It's-it's, like, pathetic. He's gonna feel like
an idiot, honestly. Just take a breath. (exhales) SUE:
What I've seen from Sam today... (scoffs)
I could easily beat him in fire. But I'm gonna go with
 what Rachel wants to do and just sit
 and be able to relax tonight, knowing that
 I'm going to the end. How's it going? No idea how to do this. I've gone 25 days. I maybe touched a flint
 one time. Very bad for me right now
because now I'm starting to wish I would have done
a little bit more to prepare
 for this potential moment. Like, making fire
 is a foreign concept to me. And it makes me really nervous
 that Teeny has a coach like Rachel who definitely knows
 what she's doing, and I've got no help. I know everybody's
 rooting against me. Guess who's at camp, pissed
that he's not getting ...? -I believe him.
-TEENY: Huh? He doesn't know what he's doing. -He's playing it up.
-I don't know. Maybe. -But he looked, uh,
genuinely annoyed.
-Thank you. -Genuinely.
-That actually helps. RACHEL:
 I feel like Teeny has really gotten her confidence up. She's ready to take on Sam. -I'm proud of that.
-You should be. And I believe she will best him tonight. I think that
 she knows what she's doing. She just has to go in
 and not panic. -Ah.
-That looks good. RACHEL:
 And have the confidence
 to get this done. That you? Yeah. When I see Teeny is making fire, I'm like, ""Oh, crap."" I'm in way over my head tonight. I'm scared. I'm worried a little bit,
you know? I, uh... You don't want to play 25 days
and come up that short. And I can... feel it slipping away
a little bit. So... I'm afraid
of what's gonna happen. I'm afraid
of looking like an idiot. I'm afraid
of everybody at home saying, ""Why didn't you practice fire?"" And me saying, ""I don't know.""
(laughs) And then I pulled out
 my letters from home, and there was something
 that my dad wrote to me. He had written that he knew I would give it absolutely
 everything I have out here, and that he wasn't
 gonna bet against me. And the thought of him rooting for me... told me,
 ""You're not one to quit."" That really fired me up. I'm not ready to go home.
 I want to see day 26. I've got to find a way to get myself
 to the end of this game. I'm on Survivor for a reason. The second you let your brain
start to get to a point of doubt is the second that you've lost. And I'm not ready
 to go there yet. I-I can't believe it. I made a fire
 and I-I built it up. And that's when I said,
let's go into Tribal Council... ...with some momentum
 and let's go to war. ♪ ♪ TEENY:
 Right now, the only thing standing between me... ...and the Final
Tribal Council... TEENY:
 ...and a chance
 at a million dollars... ...is one fire. ...is a flame
burning through a rope. It is the biggest opportunity I've ever had to change my life
 and accomplish a dream that I've been working towards since I was a conscious,
living human being. SAM:
 I have scrapped my way
 all the way to the end of this game
 on my own. So, I'm hoping that
 tonight I can find a way to find a way yet again. ♪ ♪ Now bring in
the members of our jury. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
Okay. So, let's talk
about today's challenge. Rachel, you win your fourth individual immunity challenge and in doing so, you accomplish
the goal of every player, which is tomorrow night
at Final Tribal Council, you will get a chance to face
your jury and make your case about why you're the player that is most deserving
of the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars that goes with it. We also have to take a moment to formally acknowledge that, with your fourth
individual immunity win, you join a very elite
group of women. Out of 47 seasons and 24 years, only five of you have ever won
four individual challenges. Sam, the other side of Rachel winning four
is the reminder that of the four other women,
only two of them won the game. This is not a slam dunk
that this season is over. It's just recognizing
a big achievement from a player. Yeah, absolutely.
Like, I, like everybody else, am overjoyed for Rachel, but at the same time, the necklace doesn't
win you a million bucks. And as a player in the game,
and hopefully, as jury members out of the game, we're able to separate the idea of history that should
be recognized and admired and what it takes to outwit, outplay and outlast. And, Rachel, that brings us to
the other part of winning today is this power you have
that comes with a decision. Which of these three
do you give that second spot at the final three
and which two players do you force to go make fire
and earn it? RACHEL:
Yeah. I feel like I could go to fire
and try to take out Sam, but I also feel like I earned this necklace today
in a challenge and I don't think
that I need to give it up to do another challenge
and prove whatever that proves. I mean, I came into this game being extremely loyal
to the people that I wanted to ally with. And what I learned
pretty quickly is that none of them
were as loyal to me as I was willing
to be loyal to them until I found Sue. And Sue has genuinely been the most loyal person to me and so I only feel like it is
fair to bring her to the end. And so Teeny and Sam -will be making fire.
-PROBST: So, Sue, -you're in the final three.
-SUE: I am. Thanks to Rachel. PROBST:
So, Teeny, two things of note
that Rachel said. One is she's rewarding Sue
for loyalty. What she also said is, ""I could have taken a shot
at fire to take out Sam."" So, does this create an
opportunity for you? Does this surprise you? What do you
make of that statement? Um, I feel like I have an acute sense of awareness of what these people
think of me, how they underestimate me
in this game, but it doesn't matter, necessarily, what these people think of me.
It matters what these people think of me
and it matters that I get to the point to be able to pitch my case. So, this is absolutely
an opportunity. And it's funny that it's me
and Sam because I would say Sam and I have had
a complicated relationship, and it's more my end of things. ""It's not you, it's me""? Yes, absolutely.
I would say that I've had a bit
of a one-sided rivalry with Sam, and to open up
about it honestly is that I look at Sam
and I see a handsome, smart, athletic, strong guy. And Sam's somebody who,
probably when he was younger, got a lot of, like,
attention from girls. The teachers wanted him
to be the kid who was, like, moving the desks
around the classroom. -Moving desks?
-And, like, that's
kind of the thing that I always wanted
to be doing, and, because of, you know,
my identity and my gender, just to say it, like, that's not
necessarily the experience I've gotten, and I've worked
really hard to get to a place where I'm more confident in,
like, this version of myself and how I present
to the world now. And I'm still
working through things. So, when I see Sam,
he's done nothing, honestly, throughout this game
but try and work with me. But I've projected
insecurities onto him and I've tried to get him out, on top of the fact
that I do see Sam as a threat and a really good Survivor player, too. So, right now,
the two of us making fire, it's an opportunity
for one final showdown. And if I can beat him, that's a great end
to the story for me. And if I can't, then
I'll have more to say after. PROBST:
Sam, how about for you? Opportunity? Yeah, I-I'm excited
for the opportunity. I'm at peace
with the result tonight. I'm ready to plead my case. I'm ready to fight like hell. Uh, last I checked, yeah, my torch
still has fire in it, so I'm ready to go. PROBST:
All right. So, here's how it's gonna work.
Teeny and Sam, you're gonna take a spot
at the fire-making stations. Pick whichever one you want. Oh. PROBST:
I'm gonna give you both a minute to take a look at your supplies, figure out how you're gonna
start this fire-making showdown, and then we'll go. Sam? All right, it is time for the fire-making showdown between Teeny and Sam. Each have the same job:
create a fire that burns high enough
and hot enough to burn through that rope and raise a flag.
You do that, you're in the final three. You don't, you're out and become the eighth member
of our jury. Are you ready to begin? -Yeah.
-Yeah. Good luck. Begin. Takes three things
to make a fire. You need fuel. That can come
from the magnesium. That can come
from the husk you're using. You need heat. That's gonna come from striking that flint. And then you need air. Fire's got to breathe
in order to burn. Lots of different ways
to approach making a fire. Both players prepping
a little bed, now scraping magnesium. That's a great igniter. And you get the heat you need from striking that flint and get a little bit of a spark. Teeny has a baby flame.
Can she get it? -That hessian
is limited in supply.
-Yes. There you go. PROBST: It'll burn quickly. And it'll burn out just as fast. Key is you got
to make something happen while you have the flame. Teeny is nursing that fire, adding little pieces
of kindling. It looks like it might be
positioned just under that rope, which is where you want it. PROBST: Sam continues to work, trying to get
his first real flame. Teeny has kept her fire going
and it's starting to increase. She's adding more sticks. This could be
a million-dollar fire. PROBST:
Teeny's fire continues to burn. Sam yet to get a flame. Still a long way from burning
through that rope with that wind starting to blow.
That's gonna be a factor. Sam now feeling the desperation, trying to get it to spark
and hope it ignites. PROBST: Teeny is doing a nice
job, slowly nursing that fire. Now that flame's starting
to burn higher, nicking that rope. Sam continues to try
to fight to get in this. Teeny's flame is now starting
to hit that rope. You can see the fibers
on that rope lighting up. Little by little,
that rope is getting frayed. There's another burn
of the rope. It's right under the rope now. Sam needs to get something
going to have a shot at this. Sam's got a flame going now. Sam trying
to get back into this. He's got to make something
out of that flame quickly. Can he nurse that
into something? Teeny's fire now with a gust
of wind. That helps. -Yeah.
-Keep going. PROBST: Anything that lifts it
closer to the rope. She's got a good foundation. Sam is trying
to build a foundation without smothering it. Blow, blow. PROBST: Sam is trying
to get his going higher. Can he catch Teeny
and make a game of this? Teeny adds another stick
and another. That flame is burning
all around that rope. Sam's got a flame going now. Can he catch Teeny?
We got a showdown now. Two fires. This is very close. Teeny and Sam
for a spot in the final three. Teeny's rope continues to burn. It's got to break
and pop that flag. Sam is right there in it. He's trying to get that flame,
coaxing it up. -Come on!
-PROBST: Teeny has an inferno. Teeny is all over that rope. It's only a matter of time
before it pops. Would be a huge comeback if Sam could burn his rope
before Teeny's. Sam's got a big fire.
He's burning his rope. -Now the wind is blowing Teeny's
away from the rope
-No! -and Sam's into the rope.
-Yo.
-No! -PROBST: Unbelievable
turn of events!
-Come on, baby. This could come down
to seconds being the difference. Come on, baby. -Let's go!
-PROBST: Sam pulls it out! -Come on!
-An unbelievable comeback -in the 25th day of season 47.
-Holy cow. -Oh, my God!
-PROBST: Sam will earn a spot in the final three,
and a dejected Teeny. -Find a way to find a way!
-PROBST: Wow. Never seen
a fire-making challenge -that close, ever, on Survivor. -Wow. You did really well, Teeny. All right, Teeny and Sam,
take your spots back over here. (sniffles) Teeny, it takes so much to get on Survivor. It takes so much
to get through day one, then day two, all the way to day 25. All the things you've endured
to get to this spot and to get that close
and to still fall short. It's the stakes of Survivor. But it doesn't mean
it's not terribly disappointing. So, what is the feeling
right now? (sniffles) Obviously, I'm heartbroken, and... it is something I'll have to deal with forever-- that right there, that rope still not burned. But I'm at peace as well, because I played this game exactly how I always knew
that I would. I played this game
exactly how I live my life. I played this game 100% as Teeny because that's the only way
that I know how to be. And at least
I can go out now saying that I believe I would have won
if I got there, -and I'll just never know.
-(laughing) Um, and, as I said, losing
to the big handsome jock-- it's just another part
of the story that I got to deal with. PROBST:
Well, Teeny, I got to say, it's been a pleasure
having you on the show. I respect everybody
who plays Survivor. I've never played, but I've been a witness
to every single person who has played this game
for 24 years. And I continue
to learn life lessons from all of you,
including you this season. So, thank you
for braving Survivor and coming out here and
fulfilling your childhood dream. Jeff, thank you
for giving it to me. I can't even believe I'm looking
at you in the eyes right now. And that is something that
I will carry with me forever. So, I'm happy.
I know I did my best. There's nothing more
I could have done, and that's how I'll go on. And fittingly, in Survivor, the other side
of this story is you, Sam. Teeny gave it everything
she had. She came up short. You looked like you had absolutely no shot to even get a flame.
Did you have any moments where you said, ""I'm done.
I'm not gonna get there""? The moment that
you let your brain get to, ""I'm out,"" it's self-fulfilling, in a way. But I think
the story of my game... ...has been one of resilience, so, I'm elated. PROBST:
All right, Teeny, it's time.
Need to grab your torch. SUE:
Can we have hugs? -Yeah.
-Yeah. (indistinct, quiet chatter) Bring it in, brother. -I'm proud of you.
-Thanks. You too. Never wanted to do this. But it's a part of the journey. It's a part of the journey. Teeny, the tribe has spoken. -Time for you to go.
-Thanks, Jeff. -Thanks for being out.
-Thank you for letting me. -You smell good.
-(Probst laughs) -Bye, Teeny.
-Good luck, guys. Rachel, Sue, Sam,
congratulations. You made it to the final three. Tomorrow night, as you know, the power in this game
now shifts to the jury. Eight players that
you had a hand in voting out will decide who wins this game. Prepare, be ready. You have one more night
here in Fiji. Try to get some sleep. You're gonna need it.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
We'll see you tomorrow night. -RACHEL: Good night.
-SAM: Good night. TEENY:
 I do think that moment will haunt me
for the rest of my time on Earth.
 But I've had to overcome a lot of emotional
 hardships out here. Throughout my life,
I've obtained this sort of sidekick energy. And out here I've learned to,
you know, be my own best friend, and it'll help me
 live my real life in ways I never did before. ♪ ♪ -SUE: Day 26!
 -RACHEL: Day 26! SAM: Talk about an alarm clock.
 Hello. -SUE: Good morning, sunshine!
 -SAM: Good morning. SUE: Final three. I want to scream! I'm so pumped!
I'm so pumped. I'm final three. Today is actually
 my birthday, and I'm 59 today. -RACHEL: Oh, my God!
 -SAM: I see -a big old thing.
-(Rachel shouts)
-Oh! RACHEL:
Oh, my God!
Chocolate croissants! What?! RACHEL:
 It was glorious. I've had some
good rewards out here, but this was just special. -Survivor 47.
-47. Survivor history right here. -Final three, baby.
-Final three. (all whooping) SAM: The final breakfast
 is an iconic Survivor moment that you only dream of when you step
on the mat on day one. -Sam's first watermelon, day 26.
-My first watermelon, day 26. I don't love it.
I'll eat it. I don't love it. You're crazy. SAM:
 The war is on pause until tonight. Breakfast this morning
 is a peace treaty for the remaining soldiers
to look at each other and just take a break
 from the chaos that is in this game. I might suggest
we get the skillet started here. -You need help with the fire?
-He's got the fire. SAM:
 In historic Survivor fashion,
 I come from behind, I win
the fire-making challenge. I earn my spot
in the final three. But now, the fate of my game lies in the hands of the jury-- eight people that I contributed to leaving this game. RACHEL:
 Talk about our fallen... -Oh, yeah.
-fallen friends. Sierra-- first member of the jury, the most beautiful sunshine
 on this season. SAM:
 Gone too soon. For me, especially.
(chuckles) SIERRA:
 There's a lot of things
 in this game that Sam did
that makes him a winner. Sam is somebody, once he sets a goal, he will make it happen. So, it's, like, I think he could do that tonight. -SUE: Who's next?
-Sol. -SUE: Sol.
-RACHEL: He is such a cool guy. KYLE:
Hey, Mr. Miyagi. RACHEL:
When we met on the merge beach, we instantly had a connection. Somebody sent me an advantage. Yeah. SOL:
 Here's what I know
 about Rachel's game. She got a lot of advantages. But I do believe that the majority of it
 wasn't just luck. Rachel makes people
 feel very, very comfortable. She's an impressive girl. So, who was after Sol? -Gabe.
-SUE: Gabe. Gabe. SUE:
 Gabe was intense. RACHEL:
 The scariest player
 in this game to me. He was the only one
I confided in. He was a good guy. GABE:
 Sue played an unbelievably loyal game. That is a very powerful thing
in the game of Survivor. And if Sue wants
 to get my vote, she needs to show that her loyalty was conscious loyalty
 and something that she was putting on sale. -SUE: Who went after Gabe?
-Kyle. -Kyle.
-Kyle. SAM:
 A guy who, two seconds into my first conversation
with him, I knew he had to go. PROBST:
 Kyle, safe tonight
 at Tribal Council. SAM:
 I will forever have respect for somebody who can bust it that hard. He's got more drive than I think
I've ever had in my life. KYLE:
 Sam deserves to win
 because I think that he played his underdog story perfectly. I mean, he owned
being at the bottom, and he found a way
 to find a way. SUE:
 Who was after him? -Caroline.
-SUE: Sweet Caroline.
-Sweet Caroline. SAM:
 I knew if your Caroline
 didn't go that the three of you would be
sitting here at the end. CAROLINE:
 Sue was the most loyal alliance partner
you could ever have. Sue played her game the Sue way, and that's
 absolutely undeniable. -Who's after her? Yeah.
-Andy.
-SUE: Andy. Oh.
-RACHEL: Oh, my God. Andy. SAM:
He was somebody who seemed like he didn't know
what he was doing out here. They don't like me. SAM: And the minute that
 I picked him up, I realized, ""Whoa, you're good."" RACHEL:
 I wanted to trust Andy,
 and I, like, could not for a single moment
trust him. -Okay, can we, like...
-Work together? -Maybe we can work together.
-Actually work together? -For real.
-Yeah, let's do it, Andy. ANDY:
 Rachel established herself as the threat of threats. She's made history
 with her ability in these challenges, and so, she has to have
a really good shot tonight. -SUE: Who's after Andy?
-Genevieve. SUE:
Oh, that's... Oh, wow. RACHEL:
 I feel like Genevieve and I immediately clocked each other. I was like, ""This girl is smart and I am scared of her."" Um, I think she felt
the exact same way about me. GENEVIEVE:
Rachel wrapped her hands around the control that
I so desperately wanted and wouldn't let it go, which is incredibly impressive. I want Rachel to stand up
 at Final Tribal and tell everyone how much better
she is than them. -SUE: And then we have Teeny.
-Teeny. RACHEL:
 It's apt her name
 is Teeny because she is the biggest personality,
 the biggest force. SAM:
 So much better at -this game than I expected.
-Mm-hmm. TEENY:
Sam had to be extremely scrappy. People did not want
to work with him. He was a pariah
at many times in this game. But he always found a foothold
 and he always found a way out. Sam made it to the end by truly playing the game of Survivor. SAM: Three of us. How far did you guys realistically think you would make it
coming into the game? RACHEL:
I wouldn't have come out here and played
if I didn't think I could win. RACHEL:
 I'm ready to go
 head-to-head with Sam and ready to kind of catch the grenades
he throws in my direction and lob them right back at him. I would say the same thing. I thought, like,
I would be good at it, but there's been a lot of times
that I felt like, -""All right,
this is the end of my rope.""
-RACHEL: Yeah. ""All right,
this is the end of my rope."" And then I found new rope. I know that I'm going in against a heavyweight. But my story is one that's rootable, one that the jury is gonna
want to get behind. Where do you think
your turning point was? -I think
you'll find out tonight.
-Oh. Oh. I think we'll have
to talk about it tonight. I am the guy that
 nobody could get rid of. The scrappy player
of Survivor 47. And all of the lows that
I've been through in this game, all of the fighting is worth it, 'cause I've got a shot,
and I know I've got a shot. SUE:
 This is my one last chance to give myself my birthday gift that I've been
wanting to give myself. I know that Sam and Rachel
 are up there high-fiving. Those two feel that
 they're one and two and I'm just gonna be the goat,
 but everyone underestimated me. I downplayed myself the whole
 time and I fooled them all. RACHEL:
 I'm still coming in with
 the mentality of an underdog because that's when I perform my best, is when I am backed into a corner
and my only option is to kick ass. SAM:
Going into Final Tribal Council is a lot like going
 into fire-making. I'm the underdog
 and I might look dead, but you never know when I'm gonna strike
that last second flame. Tonight, I'm not just
 hoping for fire. I'm hoping for fireworks. ♪ ♪ ANDY:
 I do not know what name
 I'm writing down tonight, and if I don't see
someone own their game like they're cooks,
 they're not getting this million dollars. CAROLINE:
 You need to explain how you executed your strategy. SIERRA:
 It's not gonna just
 be given to anybody. I want them to be sweating when we're asking
 these questions tonight. ANDY:
 This season is gonna come down to the wire. TEENY:
 Tonight is gonna be a verbal bloodbath. All right. Welcome to your
Final Tribal Council. Congratulations.
This is as far as you can go. You survived every
Tribal Council you attended and you made it
to the final three. And now it's one
of the most unique aspects of the Survivor format. The power shifts from the players in the game
to the players voted out of the game.
It is the jury who ultimately decides who will win any season
of Survivor. Tonight, they're going
to be asking you questions. They're looking for information. This is your final test. You got to figure out ""What is it
they want to hear from me?"" Jury, I'm gonna
give you a minute to gather your thoughts,
and we will get started. PROBST:
All right. Let's get to our
Final Tribal Council. Jury, who's gonna
get us started? -KYLE: Uh...
-Think I'll kick it off. -All right, Gabe.
-I think Gabe will.
-Gabinator. So, first and foremost,
a very, very big congratulations -to all three of you.
-Thank you. You accomplished a remarkable
milestone in this game just by sitting there,
and I really hope that you're proud of yourselves.
With that being said, I will kick it off
with the first question, and we'll start with Rachel and we can just
go down the line. How do you think-- not hope-- how do you think
your game will be remembered? And is that
even important to you? RACHEL:
Um, I think my game will be remembered as... someone that fell
on their face pretty hard and had the ability to adapt and go from the most underdog,
the most left-out person in this entire room to someone that became a threat. And as much as that does matter, I didn't come in trying
to have a Survivor legacy. I came in to play Survivor. So, no, I don't really care how I will be remembered. Uh, I think my game will be remembered as scrappy, a guy who never gave up
on himself, found a way
using creative strategy, social adaptability, using some charm,
using some humor, using some self-deprecation to get himself to the end. And it does matter to me how my game is remembered. I want to leave
feeling proud of myself, and other people are... You know, admire me, in a way. -Thank you.
-SUE: Yeah, so, something that's very important that I need to share
with all of you is that today, back home,
is my birthday, and I'm not in the 40s. -I'm actually 59.
-Oh. -Wow.
-SUE: So, if I were to win, I will go down in history as being the oldest woman to ever win Survivor. And my legacy is that I get to have my grandson, who's five years old, see his grandmother make it all the way through
this whole entire game being truthful and honest,
and I want to teach him that loyalty is something that can make good guys
finish first. GENEVIEVE:
Sue, I definitely agree. Your game was, like,
all about loyalty. -Yeah.
-So, do you view
lying and deception as negative traits
in someone's Survivor game -and as sort of anti-loyal?
-SUE: Oh, no, not... I expected all of that. Look, I'm not dumb.
You know, like, ""Tweedleydee,"" whatever,
but you know, like... ""Tweedleydum""-- that's not me. So, I won't judge anybody
for who they are. I just know
I have to judge myself. -All right. Caroline.
-CAROLINE: All right. So, I would love to hear what you believe is your
biggest mistake in this game and how you recovered from it. -Let's have Rachel go first.
-Sure. Then Sam, then Sue. RACHEL:
So, I started this game
not on a good footing. I miscalculated
and I didn't understand how much game
was going on around me. And then we hit the merge. You all voted out Sierra.
I was like, ""Oh, my God, what is going on?"" And I decided to course-correct and completely change my game. I tried to build bonds
with Lavo and I tried
to reconnect with Andy and I had a relationship
with Sol and I started trying
to cross-check everything. I even snuck up on people. The night of your vote-out, Caroline's vote-out, Genevieve, Teeny, Andy and Sam-- they just went to the beach. And I followed them down there
and I laid under a bush and I listened
to their entire conversation. I found out that they were
all completely against me, that Genevieve had an idol, that Teeny told them
about my advantage that I got from the journey,
that Andy had flipped. That entire conversation
is a ruse, though. Like, that was
already a premeditated... TEENY:
But to push back
on that, you know, I did reveal that she had
a Block a Vote Advantage, which -does reveal that
I was against her.
-SAM: Which we are... And if I hadn't known that,
I would not have known about the next day
to play by idol. CAROLINE:
Okay. -Sam?
-SAM: Yeah. Uh, I think my biggest mistake in this game was not tying up loose ends. Things like
throwing Andy's name out as a potential
hinky vote ended up losing me a lot of trust
with allies. But I learned that this group of people
loved sharing information and I pivoted to kind of try and weaponize it a little bit. Things like a fake idol
that I can make with Genevieve and leak information to Teeny can then help me make
a strategic play that flips the game
and taking you out of it. TEENY:
I just want to ask
a follow-up on that. When you chose to reveal
that information to me and I brought it
to Rachel and Sue, -SAM: Right.
-they did not believe you. RACHEL:
Further, in a way... -Right.
-that didn't really
matter at all. -To us.
-SAM: Well, it mattered
because I didn't -want Teeny out of the game.
It was important
-RACHEL: Right, I'm s... to my game to get Genevieve. Me too. I'm saying that,
like, even if it had been real, it would have decoyed on you, -which was also fine with us.
-SAM: Sure. Yeah, we would... It...
We didn't think twice about it. CAROLINE:
I think I have enough from that, thank you.
Sue? So, Andy, I say this
with the deepest of love. -Uh-huh.
-(laughs) SUE:
You lied to me three times and you blindsided sweet Caroline. So, believing you a third time-- that was my greatest mistake. Awesome. PROBST:
Satisfied, Caroline? -Yes.
-Sol, get in on this.
-SOL: Yeah. So, as a fan
watching this game on TV, you know, I have criticism
to give players and I'm like, ""What a stupid
move. Why would you do that?"" And when you come out here and play you realize that watching it on TV,
you don't know ... And so, for Rachel, here's what I believe
to know about your game. I gave you
the Safety without Power vote, which saved you in the game. You found an idol clue
in the French fries. You had a Block a Vote, and you made a historic run with the immunity challenges. Give me one thing that I don't know
about your game that will blow my mind. RACHEL:
I think final six,
when I knew I was in trouble, I don't think I could have
played that idol any more effectively. Having every single person
in the game sell your game
to the jury for you without you actually leaving
the game-- that was something that I've never seen
on Survivor. That was something that I'm really proud of
that I pulled off. SOL:
Okay, so, a follow-up to Sam. Eulogizing Rachel--
it backfired on you. So, my response to Rachel... I was very intentional
with the idea of elevating
Rachel's threat level. I had to gas somebody up in front of everybody else
so that nobody's looking at me,
everybody's looking at Rachel. So, I was able
to navigate the game without the protection
of an immunity necklace. I was able to put another threat
above myself. Think the problem is you didn't
take the threat out. Saying you can't beat someone in front of the jury and then
going to the end with them is not a strategy that I think
is a very smart one. SAM:
But you made it clear you wanted
me out when you helped Teeny at fire all day yesterday and told me you didn't
want to help me because ""I need Sam
out of this game."" I would rather have Sam -out of the game than Teeny.
-And that's... I mean... And I would have rather
not sit next to you. But sometimes people
win immunity challenges. It didn't go perfectly, but didn't go perfectly
for anybody else sitting here. I'm all set, Jeff. Andy? My question is for Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Andy, Andy. I really believe that
we are the two biggest superfans out here, so, I know that coming into this that the likes of Mike Holloway and Ben Driebergen are not highly ranked -on your winner list.
-Yeah. -They're not, personally, right?
-No. ANDY:
But here you are,
the challenge beast. You were, in my opinion,
better than Kyle, who's amazing. -(laughing)
-ANDY: You run the analytics
on it. It's better than Kyle's. You are the idol-finder, and we all know you would
be the fire-maker if you needed to be. And you have
the worst voting record of this final three. -Yeah.
-And so, if you
want my vote tonight, you really have
to reconcile this. Yeah, you're right, that being Mike Holloway
in this game is not how I ever
saw it happening. I came into this game
thinking that my social prowess would allow me
to maneuver strategically, but I couldn't
convince other people to do my bidding
like I hoped I could out here. It just forced me to find a different way
to play the game, like winning immunity.
And yet, I had a final-three deal
with Teeny and Andy. I had a final-three deal
with Caroline and Sue. And I brought all of us together
because I was like, ""This five-- this is my best option
to protect myself,"" if I couldn't go
on this crazy immunity run. SAM:
I think Rachel said it well
when she said she couldn't get people
to do her bidding anymore. She lost a lot
of strategic agency and social agency, which was the entire purpose
of elevating her threat level and taking out
one of her numbers. So, I don't think
she can reconcile. It was immunities
and an idol in fries that got her
to the end of this game. RACHEL:
I think it's easier to say that from your perspective,
where people weren't totally -targeting you because you...
-I got-I got voted for more than anybody here.
I'm the only one in the game that never voted incorrectly. I was voted for at four
different Tribal Councils and received a total of
ten votes throughout this game. And I was somebody
who you said, multiple times, I need out of this game
as a threat. Sierra? -(chuckles softly) Sisi.
-SIERRA: Rachel and Sam, I played my game the closest with you both and really got to know you
on a personal level. And we discussed times at home when we hit rock bottom and how you
overcame that rock bottom. I really just
want to know how you translated that in the game.
When you hit a low, what did you do to overcome
that low, and, you know, how does that reflect, like,
why you should be the name I'm writing down tonight? -SAM: Yeah, I... Oh, sorry.
-SIERRA: Sam, if you
want to take the l... Yeah, I think I... I channeled the joy that
I knew was on the other end. Uh, like, the thought of watching an epic, fire-making
duel with my parents, the thought of hearing my fiancée's voice
in my head telling me, like, ""Don't you dare give up
on yourself."" You know? Um, and I thought of being a six-year-old kid
watching Survivor and telling myself
and everybody around me, ""I'm gonna do that one day. I'm gonna be that one day."" And I thought
of letting him down, you know? And I think that
continually fueled me when I felt like I was at
my lowest moments in this game. And it's why
I continued to surprise myself and did some things
that I didn't expect to achieve out here. I really appreciate that, Sam. -Thank you.
-RACHEL: Yeah. Um, my rock-bottom day on this entire journey
was the night you went home, when I went back to camp and was like,
""I have no one in this game."" And I just channeled
my husband Derek. He wrote me this note before
I came out here that said, ""Any of this pain that
you feel is temporary ""and you just need
to trust your instincts and I know you can do this."" I was channeling him in everything that I did
and it just kept working. And in my everyday life, I've had a lot
of personal accomplishments, like, in my career, in my life, and I don't ever own the things that I accomplish. And I knew that
coming in tonight, the hardest part
about sitting here would be, like, owning my game,
truly, and just being like, ""I am proud of this game
that I've played."" And that's what I'm hoping
to bring home with me. Like, I look at my husband
and I see the most talented artist
I've ever met. And yet he doesn't have
that much self-confidence. And it's really hard for me
to look at him and see that. And then I realized that, like, that's probably also
what I'm doing, you know? And so, I think that
I will take that home with me and I hope to be able
to share this with him. And that is something that I
think will affect my real life. GABE:
And Sierra presented that question to you two
because of the personal relationship
that she had with both of you. And, you know, I had
a very personal relationship with Sue out here, and I'd like to hear
her answer to that question. SUE:
So, I-I found that
when I hit my low, I actually found the strength to share with my tribe. And even Kyle-- like, you hugged me and you held me. That compassion
you all gave to me gave me so much strength,
knowing I had support. I'll forever be grateful
for the kindness that all of you gave to me
at my times of weakness. PROBST:
All right, so, jury, great job. Sue, Sam, Rachel, I'm gonna give each of you
one final chance to address the jury.
They've done a really great job of giving you a chance
to defend your game. These are your last words
to them before they vote. Sue? So, at 59 years old, I came in here
and I was pretty much of a beast in my own right. I actually won
the bucket challenge and I could have outlasted
the two gentlemen that were there as well. -Yes, I could have.
-(laughing) You were struggling, Kyle. You went head-to-head with me
a couple times. -SUE: Yeah.
-We've seen how that turned out. Well, but again,
as a 59-year-old, I beat all your asses, right? -(laughing)
-I found the Beware Advantage. I stayed loyal to the people
I wanted to go to the end with, and I did get out the people
I needed to get out and, um, I would love your vote. Sam? I did not play a perfect game
by any means, but I think my game
was the most well-rounded, adaptable, dynamic and creative game of the three people
sitting up here. Social and strategic resilience, creative gameplay. I found a way
to take control of the game without raising my threat level. I found multiple pathways
to get to the end without relying
on winning immunity necklaces or buying the right item
at the auction. So, I believe that if
you're looking for the player that outwitted,
outplayed and outlasted, despite being counted out
multiple times, I deserve your vote tonight. -Rachel?
-I believe that
I am sitting here with the most dominant game
of the three of us. There were two advantages
and one idol in the post-merge,
and I controlled all of them. And that wasn't just
through luck. It was through
social connection. It was through stealthiness. I had to get an idol
when everyone was at camp, and then I had to play it in a incredibly large fashion that I feel like
made a huge statement. I won four immunities and I tied a record and I'm really,
really proud of it. And so, I sit here pleased with my game and my story, from going from a super underdog
to a big dog. And I hope I get your vote. PROBST:
All right, jury,
great Final Tribal Council. You asked a lot
of thoughtful questions. You gave the final three
a chance to defend their game and you gathered a lot
of information in the process. I'm gonna give you a moment
now to take it all in and then we will vote. ♪ ♪ All right, well, this is
the only time in Survivor when you want to see your name
on the parchment. For the last time, it is time to vote. Sierra, you're up. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go get the votes. Uh-huh. Well, we've done this 47 times. And it's different every time because of the players. Sue, Rachel, Sam, you played three
very different games, but it got you here.
The question is did it earn you
a million dollars? We're about to crown a winner of Survivor 47. I'll read the votes. First vote: Rachel. Sam. One vote Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Two votes Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Three votes Rachel,
one vote Sam. Rachel. Four votes Rachel, one vote Sam. The winner of Survivor 47: Rachel. Well, there it is! We have our winner
of Survivor 47. All it took was 26 days of living in the jungle,
playing the most complicated game
of social politics that got Rachel
a million dollars. Jury, come on over. -Celebrate your winner.
-Let's go, let's go. It was a crazy finish. There were a lot
of late-season big moves that took out
of lot of big targets and continued to flip the game. So, what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna bring in some champagne,
we're gonna bring in some pizza in the beautiful jungles
of Fiji here at the great Tribal Council.
We're gonna talk about it all. It is the Survivor 47 aftershow. We'll be right back. I need a little champagne, too.
Let's go. Aw, thank you. -Congratulations.
-RACHEL: Thank you. PROBST:
Oh, what a fun season. (all whooping) PROBST:
 Up next... We have just
crowned our newest winner. -Rachel, congratulations.
-(cheering, whooping) Andy, one of the worst starts -Yes.
-in the history of Survivor. Here's your first look
at Survivor 48. -♪ ♪
-(indistinct chatter) All right, welcome
to the Survivor 47 aftershow. There's a lot of energy.
We have just crowned our newest winner, -Rachel. Congratulations.
-(whooping, cheering) Your name will now be forever a part of Survivor history
as you join a very special list of people
who've won this game. Your name is also about to be
written down on a check -Oh, my God.
-for a million dollars. -SIERRA: Oh, my God.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God.
-PROBST: So, I want to exploit a moment.
The reason that I like doing the aftershow immediately following is because this is as pure as it will
ever get for any of you. Because you haven't been home. Nobody knows,
outside of this group, what has happened. You haven't
been influenced by social media and all the criticism
that'll come with that that you don't deserve.
So, let's time-stamp this
right now, Rachel. -You just won Survivor 47.
-(Sierra laughs)
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my... (exhales)
You can let it out. -What is that feeling
-GABE: Yes. of accomplishing something -this difficult to achieve?
-RACHEL: I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience,
because it's just so surreal that this show that
I fell in love with because I... the second I watched it,
I was like, ""I have to do that."" And the biggest lesson
I think I walked in with is I thought
I had such a good grasp of my strengths
and my weaknesses, and I think that this game really flipped
that completely on its head, and yet I was able
to just kind of work with it
and adapt to it and-and land myself here, and I am... I'm, like, a little bit in
shock, if I'm completely honest. I thought Sam had
an incredible Final Tribal, -and I genuinely did not know
-PROBST: Agreed. -(all assenting)
-where those votes were going, -and I got very nervous.
-Well, let's see--
let's talk about the votes. With the jury, Rachel got
all the votes except for one. -Who voted for Sam?
-Kyle. Kyle, what was--
(chuckles) I know you would
vote for yourself. Kyle, what was
the rationale for Sam? KYLE:
I just-- I really
appreciate Sam and I appreciate where he's headed in life,
his sacrifices, his ethic, the way
that he puts himself in front of
vulnerable situations. This man right here
means a lot to me. He's impacted my life greatly.
And I love him for that. -Cheers.
-(all toasting) -(whoops)
-To Sam. PROBST:
And, Sam, I want to echo what Rachel said, which is I'm closer to the audience than I am
to being a player, for sure, and I thought tonight's
Final Tribal was riveting. -Yeah.
-PROBST: So, Sam,
when you hear that, even from the woman who just beat you-- that she said,
""I got nervous, that was a really compelling argument""-- does that give you
a sense of pride even though you didn't
get the votes to win? Yeah, for sure. I mean,
I'm disappointed not to win, but I knew
it was an uphill battle coming in.
Like, I just tried to come into tonight
with the same mentality I went into fire with, you know? Come out fighting
and give it my best. I knew I could make
a compelling case. I felt like I played a really good game
that I should be proud of. And I came into tonight, like, wanting to win but at peace
with the result regardless. And, so, yeah, I'm-I'm blessed. PROBST:
Sue, I'm gonna
give you a little love. I want to share
a statistic with you. -Okay.
-Forty-seven seasons, 24 years, 700-some
people have played, 350 have been women. There have been
21 women over 50. That's five percent. Of those, there have
only been five that have made it to the end.
That's a little over -(mouths)
-one percent. You were
in a very rare group. Survivor is a tough game once you're over 40. -Brutal. Yeah.
-PROBST: And you made it
to the end. -What is that feeling for you?
-SUE: I just wanted to represent the people of my generation,
to show them that life doesn't end at 50 or 60 or 70. It's just--
You-you-- you have to just go for it,
and I just went for it. And I'm very proud of my game. I'm very proud of what I did
and what I accomplished and how I achieved it
and, all in all, you know, it's been, like,
the hardest experience yet the most
beautiful experience, and I feel like I have
a whole new family here, and I'm really
blessed to be here. Cheers to Sue. -Aw, thank you.
-(all giving cheers)
-Badass. -Sue.
-Yeah. PROBST:
Sue, you were also one of a few people to find an idol
this season. And the way each of you -found them was very unique
-SUE: Right. Yeah.
-to the situation. Rachel, you buy a burger,
get some fries. (laughing) When did you know
there was something in there? Did you see it first or did you reach for a fry
and feel it? I went to reach for another fry
and all of a sudden I saw the piece of paper
 sticking out of my fries. And it was, like,
 half sticking out. It was, like, kind of obvious. And I immediately was like, ""Oh, my God."" And I look over and Sol is staring at my platter. And I thought you saw it. -Because...
-Oh, I'm just a big burger fan. I know.
And so, I... Like, at one point, he was just
like, ""Can I smell your burger?"" And I was like, ""Okay,
he was staring at the burger. And I, like, covered it up.
It was harrowing. PROBST:
Andy, I want to go back
to the first episode. -Yes.
-Day three. -ANDY: Yes.
-One of the worst starts -ANDY: Yes.
-for any player
in the history of Survivor. Und-Undoubtedly. So, Andy, give everybody else
the update. I was overheated.
I-I'm okay now. -PROBST: Okay. All right.
-I'm okay now. I'm cooled down. -All right. You feel all right?
-Yeah. Okay.
You seem emotional. Yeah.
I was fighting for my life. I'm on the bottom. I see it in their eyes when... they don't--
I crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon and they... And then I... I... They don't like me. PROBST:
But I don't want to talk about
the bad part. -ANDY: Yeah.
-I want to talk about
the recovery, because anybody
watching this season, when they saw that happen
at the challenge, they said,
""He's done, no chance."" ANDY:
I... just felt the enormity
of this opportunity-- in terms of not the game
but my life. And it was, ""Hey, like, if you ""stay down ""and if you give up, like, could you even survive that?"" And so, every single
breath I take until that torch is snuffed
should be to find the will to survive. And I found this resiliency that I could
never have imagined. And it's completely orthogonal to what
I expected to happen, and-- Are we all listening
to his word choice -and wondering what they mean?
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, yeah. -Orthogonal.
-Orthogonal?
-Orthogonal. -Orthogonal.
-Orthogonal.
-The linguistic... It's a right angle.
It's not... -An-Anyway...
-PROBST: Of course! Sam, it's a right angle.
Hello? -I know.
-My bad.
-SOL: My bad. -Cheers to Andy. Well done.
-ANDY: Thank you. (all toasting) PROBST:
He turned the worst start -in Survivor history into
-Yeah. -a life-changing moment.
-Yes. Yes. On that note, quick break.
More aftershow right after this. GABE: Where'd my bottle go? PROBST: Up next... I was born the year Survivor came out. You really impressed me
with how you -carried yourself.
-Thank you, Jeff.
-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) PROBST:
 Plus, later, a first look at Survivor 48. Welcome back
to the Survivor 47 aftershow. Let's talk about blindsides. They're essential to the game.
We had a lot this season.
They grew in intensity and they grew in their impact. Genevieve, if there was
an essential quality-- outside of being able to lie-- that allows you to pull off
a blindside, what is it? You have to prepare, when you come out
to play Survivor, to experience it all.
You can fantasize about experiencing only the highs
and playing from the top. But, like, raise your hand if you played from the top
the entire time. No one.
So, be prepared to be on the bottom. Caroline, anything
you would add to that? I think another one
is being socially aware. What I personally found to be
really helpful with blindsides is thinking through
what is best for each person's game? When is it that
a blindside right now is gonna be beneficial for
this person and this person and this person? And that
is when they want to strike. Gabe, did you struggle at all with the emotional part and if you didn't, is that
because you turned it off -or you just don't struggle?
-(Genevieve chuckling) Uh... I don't think I struggle
with the emotional part so much.
I-I mean, look, I-I was able to come into this game and say,
like, ""It's just a game. ""I'm coming out here to win
the title of Sole Survivor and to make a million dollars."" So, I knew that I was
gonna break some eggs making an omelet.
And that's what you got to be prepared to do
if you're gonna be a good chef
on Survivor, right? Teeny, you grew up
watching this show. Now you're out here
playing this show. What would you say to somebody
who's never gonna play, ""Oh, here's what you need to
know in order to understand why this game is so difficult""? You know, being somebody who--
I was born the year Survivor came out.
Sorry to age anybody. -Wow.
-But-- Yeah. I mean,
like, I've grown up with this show.
And you have to realize that we're all, at our core,
obsessed with Survivor. And so when you come out here, you start at the baseline of we put so much
sacrifice into this, we put so much work into this and we put so much love and pressure on ourselves
because of this. So, every single
round of the game is life or death. So, to have to overcome that and make hard
decisions while you're starving, while you're stressed out, while you're unsure
of who's lying to you-- it is almost frustrating. Because I know that nobody that I ever explain this to
will fully grasp what it is that
we've had to do out here. And I hope that I was able
to articulate that well enough. PROBST:
Teeny, I just want to say,
as you mentioned, you were born, basically,
when Survivor started. Really impressive to see a young person
come out here and play a game with people--
some of which are quite a bit older
and have more life experience-- and the young person
never thinks that's a deficit. But, being around here
for a while, it is.
Life experience matters. You really impressed me
with how you carried yourself. So, I hope you're proud
of the game you played. -Thank you, Jeff.
-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) Thank you.
I really appreciate that. -GABE: Teeny chill, Teeny chill.
-Teeny, cheers. Okay, now we have to
turn the corner. -It's hard to say goodbye--

be a living fool-- which I kind of am right now-- than, you know,
a dead know-it-all. And, Mo, I just
want to say, you know, I totally think you're valuable in this tribe. -Mm-hmm.
-TIM: Nobody wrote your name. -BEN: Yeah.
-You know what I'm saying? Like, that's... that's valuable. MORIAH:
I'm appreciative that I'm here, and I really am Siga strong. I'm feeling conflicted inside. I mean, they lied to me. I was out of this vote,
 but at the same time, I did not see my name
 a single time. So that tells me maybe there's still room
for me to grow in this game. Otherwise, I got
a Shot in the Dark burning a hole in my pocket. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ KENZIE: It took Yanu a really long time
to get our stuff together, but once we got it, we got it. Just, like, reigniting
 the fire this morning, and it caught in three seconds-- like, that's how we're doing. We finally have a... that spark
that's gonna keep us going. Thank you. -Oh, my God.
-You want to open it? -Oh, my God.
-TIFFANY: This is,
like, a real note. Let's see. (Tiffany screams) -Told you!
-(Tiffany and Kenzie scream) I thought-I thought we had... This lovely piece of paper says, ""Drop your Buff. We're taking you
to your new home."" And if you watch Survivor, you know what that means. Merge, baby. -You were good to us
while it lasted.
-Kinda. No, he wasn't. TIFFANY:
 To make it with the people that I actually wanted
 to make it with-- my best two pals-- oh, my God. It's, like,
the best feeling ever. Giddyup, baby. Let's go play. TIFFANY:
 And, of course,
 we cannot forget our biggest ally, Adelisha,
who I keep in my bra. She is not going anywhere, and I feel like
she's really gonna help us out
when we get to this new beach. Oh, my God! (chanting):
Merge! Merge! Merge! Merge! TIM:
 We're headed to a new camp. We don't know what's in store. TIM:
 And right now,
 we are Siga strong. Five. But in my opinion, Mo's still on the bottom, so, if it comes to a point
 where we have to eat our own, it would be Mo. We're going in stronger
than we were last night. MARIA:
That's right. I am elated. In theory, there's
 a pretty likely chance I am the bottom of this five. But when the game changes, so do your relationships. And if I don't got four friends
rooting for me here, I might have four enemies, and that's not gonna get me far
 in this game. You know, go with the devil you know
over the devil you don't. HUNTER: ""Drop your Buffs. Your fellow castaways
will be joining you soon."" (screams)
I knew it! Oh, my... God. -Drop your Buffs!
-Oh, my God! HUNTER: We got tree mail today,
 and when we open it, I see that
it's the ""Drop your Buffs."" Like, it's happening now, which is exciting, but for me, it starts a timer. And so, I run like I'm doing a little airplane down the beach so that my tribe buys that Hunter's just excited about
  this ""Drop your Buffs thing."" HUNTER:
But in reality, a few days ago, I found the Beware Advantage. It says you have to wait
 until either you lose or you drop your Buffs
to get a clue to find a key to open a box to get the idol. Then I have to run back
 to the place where I found this Beware Advantage
to begin with, dig it up and follow whatever
instructions it has for me before the new Tribemates
 show up. And so, this unknown timer just automatically
starts counting down. Okay. Okay. It's got
to be some of the steps. Maybe the steps
in front of camp. The thing that gave it away-- ""This step
won't lead you astray."" And I almost immediately
 know where it is. Back at camp at the step. SODA:
I can't even process this
right now. A bunch of new people. HUNTER:
 So I go back to camp, and everyone is just sitting
 in the shelter, so, what am I supposed to do? SODA: You vibe. -HUNTER: Catch my breath.
-SODA: You catch your breath. -You can do you.
Catch your breath.
-VENUS: Yeah. HUNTER:
 And so I'm like, ""Whatever. I'm gonna go sit on the steps."" VENUS:
What's his mindset right now? 'Cause I can't read him. -SODA: Who?
-VENUS: Hunter. SODA:
You got to ask him.
I don't know. I just asked.
You don't have to shut me out each time I ask you a question. SODA:
That's your feelings.
They're valid. I don't know. I know.
I didn't say you did know. HUNTER:
So I'm digging in these stairs, but I can't find anything,
 and it's... It's pressure from all over. I've got people behind me probably gonna
come down the steps. I'm looking for a boat
 to come on the horizon. I mean, realistically,
we used to talk all the time in the beginning,
and now you barely talk to me. And that's just a real...
that's, like... I'm not blind, so, like,
that's just reality. SODA: I feel like we have
not so much to talk about because Nami
keeps winning, and... But we need
to talk to each other. Like, it doesn't have
to be strategy all the time. HUNTER:
 If those boats show up, the time
to find the idol is done. So, there is definitely
 a ticking time bomb. I don't just have
 to find this thing. I'm not looking for the idol. I'm looking for the key
that gets me to my box that opens it
and then I get the idol. And so, there's so much to do
 and so little time and so many pressures,
 and you're just like, ""Oh, my goodness. I've got to get moving
with this."" Oh, golly. Hey, Hunter. Come on, Liz. And so, I finally
 get the key out, and then here comes Liz, almost instantly, to talk to me. I think I left a sling
out by the boat... 'cause I was excited. I'll go get it for you. I think I left my other one
out there, too. I don't think
 she sees anything, and so, I hightail it to where
I've hidden this thing. VENUS:
Oh! Dude, they're making
a beeline, bro. (whispering): Nice, nice, nice,
nice, nice, nice, nice. Oh, my God. I finally open the box. There it is-- a full-blown idol
sitting in this box for me to use that nobody... knows about. That was way too stressful. This is also
 really important because I lost my vote
 on the last journey. And so, in the end, this could be the only thing
that saves me. ♪ ♪ (whooping) The monster is coming. I look out into the water, then what do I see but two boats
 coming at me at full speed. I said... Here they come. (both whooping) LIZ:
Land ho! Oh... my goodness. TEVIN: What I wanted to do was make people feel comfortable
when they get here. Come on, y'all! Human to human, I see you.
 We all here. You got a dream, I got a dream. Hello, fellow human.
Let's play the game. -Oh!
-Hi, Charlie. -Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.
Nice to meet you, too, man. Oh, it's so good to see you. KENZIE:
We're pulling up on Nami beach. I am just feeling
 so accomplished. There's five on Siga,
five on Nami, but there's three of us right in
the middle. Three of us Yanu. And ideally, it's just like,
 ""Which way are we gonna go?"" TIFFANY: Oh, my God. Yanu really got it handed to 'em in the beginning
 of this game, so, we've got some experience
 in our belt that the other tribes
 don't have. I know what it's like
to see Jeff snuff a torch. Nami doesn't know that at all,
and Siga's only done it once. So, I'm like
 a cast iron skillet that's been, like,
 oiled up and seasoned. And they're like store-bought,
nonstick right now. Like, that's where we're at. -Hi, everybody.

one thing to everybody out here. I don't know
what's about to happen, but congratulations. (whooping, cheering) TIM:
It's hard. Just major congrats. TIM: We're excited, but we don't have any Buffs.
There's no merge. We're in this Survivor limbo. And so, we're kind of wondering what does happen next. TIM:
 But I know that
 my tribe is priority, so, we don't want
 any cracks evident. We want to seem like
 we're five strong because we don't want anybody
 to be exposed 'cause if we said that
Moriah voted for Ben, they could think she's possibly
 on the outs of Siga, and probably use her
 as an alliance. And right now, we got
 to protect Siga's numbers. -VENUS: I mean, you know,
same thing as Siga.
-Winning. When you keep winning,
like, no one's scrambling, no one's drawing lines. But I-I just want
to work with you guys. It's a breath of fresh air
to have new people on this camp. I am so excited to, like,
 have a new conversation and to not be met
with silence and blank stares from Tevin and Soda. Like, I am so over
just their attitude towards me. Tevin is the type of person
where if you were next to him
in final three, I'm sorry, you're not winning. I have a good feeling
 that I can actually connect with new people and gain
 some more traction and, like, some more power in this game.
I feel like I've had no power on Nami,
I've had no say. Like, I've been on the bottom
and King Tevin's been here, controlling all his puppets,
and now I get to be the king. Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mmm,
mm-mm-mm-mmm. Q: My take on the Nami group is there's cracks
all around this island. They have a beautiful home, but
they ain't filled the cracks. And that is perfect because I've already kind of laid
 the foundation for the plus-one alliance. TIFFANY: Okay. TEVIN:
And I said,
""That is a beautiful idea."" I love it. I love it. -Beautiful idea.
-Chef kiss. Q:
 Hunter, Tim and myself made an alliance at the journey, and we all got the opportunity
to pull in one person who we all must protect. I pulled in Tiff. Hunter pulled in Tevin. Tim pulled in Maria. So today, the journey six is what I want to try
to make sure is intact. -Yeah?
-I'm more so... I'm just unsure about Tim because he has so many options
over there, 'cause they do seem like
they're all getting along. Q:
 But Hunter and I--
 we still are a little wary about Tim and Maria on whether or not
they're on board. We have to make sure
that the six is solid. Yeah. Q: So, my next talk needs
 to be Maria because I wanted to figure out,
has Tim done his part? Did Tim talk to you
after the journey? Tim talked to me
after the journey. -Okay. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we-we kind of all do
everything together. I don't know
if you've heard that. -Yeah, he told us. Um...
-We... We sit down and talk
about everything, and everyone knows
everything, and... Now, Tim and I and Hunter--
we was talking, and Tim was telling us
you're his guy. -Oh, really?
-Um, well, when I say ""guy,"" -like, that's the... that...
-I'm his person? -Yeah, that's the person. -MARIA: Evidently, Tim told Q on their journey that
 Tim and I were really close. And I was like,
""Huh? Like, what about Ben? Like, I thought
Ben was your number one."" Like, I thought
it was very strange. You know,
 Charlie is my number one, and Tim and I have
 a connection, but by no means would I have
put him top on my list. Like, he might have been
number three. You know, everybody
has their person -in, like, different ways. -Q: Out of the gate, Maria didn't seem too filled in on the six, so I wanted to figure out
 what Tim actually told her from our journey. If Tim did not fill Maria in
 on the six, I know now
Tim is not to be trusted. And the other thing... Q: I-I didn't... TIM: No, I just think... She a connection type person,
so anything, like... She gonna feel you out
even if I tell her or not, you know, so I just like... I like that y'all
was already talking. I want to work
 with the group of six. I think they're strong, I think they have a good likelihood
 to go far in the merge. I've also seen
 people commit too early in past seasons
 of Survivor, so, I'm exploring, I'm observing. No solid game plans, but I'm not
 saying nothing too soon. I'll secure it before nightfall. I'll tell her the loop. Q:
 I'm so confused as to why
 Tim didn't tell Maria. Maybe he's trying to keep
 this Siga thing intact, but it got me worried now.

 You know, it's a new stage
 in the game, and I'm so excited
 to start making big moves. It's been 12 days
 of just camping, and I didn't come here to camp. I came here
 to play the game, so, I need to see where Siga stands
and where those cracks lie. TIM:
You know, everybody agrees
to that before a merge. It's like,
""We're gonna be Siga..."" -TIM: Right.
-Yeah, I mean, we're... We're entering, like,
a different st... -Yeah.
-Numbers will give... VENUS:
 These tribal lines-- they're gonna have
 to dissolve. So, I said, ""I believe
in a name for a name, and ""if you're willing
 to give me Siga, I'm willing to give you one
 of my Nami members."" I feel like all of us might want
to say something, but no one wants to talk first. Oh, I'm always gonna listen and watch the group before I can, like,
make a decision -on how I feel about anything.
-MORIAH: Yeah. Like, I've been trying here
'cause it's important, but, like, to be honest,
it's overwhelming for me. Me too. Okay. We're, like,
the exact same person. They didn't really give me
 an answer, but Moriah-- I have a connection with her.
I feel like I can trust her. I feel like she's a sweet girl, and I think
 she'll come around to it. So, now that I've planted seeds,
 I want to see what comes up. I have power in this game, too,
and if you don't see that now, you will see it very soon.
(chuckles) CHARLIE:
These rays are nice,
coming through the clouds. This is a trippy view. MORIAH:
 Clearly, the crack in Nami is Venus, and it sounds like there might be wiggle room
 to get a Nami out. But at the same time, Venus is clearly
a strong social player. She is aggressive
with her strategy, she is smart, she is thinking. So she's not someone
I necessarily want to work with. She's crafty. -What about you?
-Um, Venus approached Tim and me
with strategy talk. MORIAH:
She just said, ""Yeah, like, ""I'd be interested
in a name for a name."" Like, Tim and I tell her
the cracks on Siga and she tells us
 the cracks on Nami. Okay. Venus is playing
 a really hard game. Everyone can see that. She's wicked smart,
as we say in Boston. She's got a good mind
 for the game, and she could be a threat to me. I did a quick check-in with Mo. Sounds like Venus was
hitting you guys pretty hard. -TIM: Oh, yeah, yeah.
 -CHARLES: Yeah, yeah. -TIM: She came with it.
 -CHARLIE: Yeah. I'm not worried
about it, though. I'm not entertaining that 'cause Venus
is giving it too hard. She said ""name for name.""
You know what I'm saying? She... And you guys
didn't give one yet? No, I said, ""I get it.
I totally understand. You know, I'll think about it."" We're clearly
 playing the game now, but I'm not worried. I'm in a better position
 than I thought I'd be because I have both Siga and the, uh, plus-one alliance. But Q is asking Maria, ""Hey, have you talked to Tim?"" So, I got to talk to her
 one-on-one about the plus-one alliance. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like, looking out... That's what Q put out first, and...
Hunter and I confirmed it. Like, yeah,
these are the people we trust. -Okay. Okay.
-And we agreed that we'll look out
for each other's name. So at the end of the day, us six are potentially voting
the same way. I didn't tell Maria
 immediately because I wanted Maria
to make her thoughts or her own feelings about the group of six. And at the end of the day, she agreed it was a strong six. I'm down for it.
You know, like... -You're down for it?
-Yeah, I'm down... I don't want to put that on you
'cause I know we didn't... No. Like, I was surprised 'cause
you and I didn't talk about it. -Yeah.
-I was like, ""Oh, okay."" -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You know, like... If there's a group of six, I'm down for it because it's nice to have options. But the question is
 does it work for me? Because I'm not here
to play Tim's game. I'm here to play my game. I'll take them anywhere.
The pool in the neighborhood. That's what I go for. I can eat
a whole bag of those things. Q: Listening
 to the Siga players now, it's really not much
about strategy or who they want to work with. They're playing a more cards-to-your-chest
 type of game. So, I want to make sure
 I get out there, have the right conversations so I can start to piece together
 the puzzle. I-I bet it was crazy when
y'all got back on the beach. Everybody skedaddled. It really was. I mean, there's that moment of,
like, ""Do we open a coconut? Like, anyone hungry?"" -It was unanimous, huh?
-Yeah. Other than my own tribe,
 no one knows that I'm potentially
 the crack in Siga because I was the one left out
 at the last Siga vote. But right now,
 the general consensus is that we need to stay united, so, I'm putting on this face that
we unanimously voted out Jem. Did she know
she was going home or... She didn't use
her Shot in the Dark, so we just assumed,
I guess not. Whose name did she write down? Um, she wrote down...
I think she wrote down Ben. -That's crazy.
-Yeah. MORIAH:
 Out of all the conversations
 I've had, I felt like Q is almost, like, hitting me the hardest. And that tells me
 he's looking for these cracks in a way that other people might not be, so, there's a little bit
of trepidation there. Survivor is, like,
so complicated. It's one of those, like... I don't think there's
a whiteboard big enough -in the world to, like,
draw everything.
-Correct. Me? I started, like,
with Aubry. I think that she came out here and was just, like,
authentically herself. -That's it.
-And, like, Aubry was really
the person that... It... (coughs) got me hooked. Like, she's my, like,
OG, for like, watching, -like, the 30s and everything.
-Yup. Mo seems like a nice person, but I'm scared of her. Where's everybody else?
At the beach? At the beach, but I was, like... -Is she?
-Ooh. Yeah. Mo is just a Survivor fanatic that can talk, talk, talk
 this game. And for you to say Aubry
 is your favorite player-- that is dangerous,
 because Aubry was setting up people
left and right. And if Mo thinks
 she's gonna set me up, Mo can cancel Christmas. It ain't happening. Come on in. -CHARLIE: Oh, my...
-PROBST: Look at this. You're gonna need
everything you've got in the tank today. -(weak chuckle)
-Oh...
-SODA: Crazy. All right.
Shall we get to it? -(all voicing assent)
-First things first. Got to take back the idols.
Thank you, Hunter. -TEVIN: Okay.
-SODA: My God. -Thanks, Kenzie.
-Yeah. No problem. -This is gonna be crazy.
-(indistinct chatter) Tribal immunity... no more. -TEVIN: Wow.
-Ooh.
-Really? What? -Sorry.
-Are you new? No. I'm sorry.
I thought we were gonna split, and then it was gonna be...
I-I know it's not a tribe. Okay, whatever.
Just do your thing. -I'll do my thing.
-Sorry. So right now,
you're in Survivor limbo. You don't have a Buff. Technically, you are not
part of a tribe, but for at least six of you,
that's about to change. Let's get into it.
For today's challenge, we're gonna randomly divide
you into two groups of six. On my go, one at a time, you'll race under a muddy net to a cart. Once everybody's at the cart, you'll push that cart
 through the field, collecting very heavy sandbags
 along the way. You'll then use those sandbags to get you
 to the top of a tower. Once everybody's up top,
 you'll collect a bag of keys, slide down the other side. You're not finished. You will then work together
to climb a massive boulder. When everyone's at the top,
 two players at a time will use one crate
 of puzzle pieces to solve one section of a three-section puzzle. So everybody's on the puzzle. -TEVIN: Mm-hmm.
-MORIAH: Wow. PROBST:
First group to finish earns their merge Buff,
a merge meal... (cheering) ...and immunity
at tonight's Tribal Council. -Yes.
-You'll go to Tribal. You will cast a vote, -but you can't be voted for.
-Wow. Losing group,
no Buff, no meal, no immunity. -Damn.
-PROBST: Because there are 13, one person will not run. Whoever draws the gray rock
will choose one group and win or lose with them. -(whistles)
-Big enough stakes? (all voicing assent) -Shall we draw for our groups?
-(all voicing assent) Oh, my God. Good luck, guys, everyone. PROBST:
All right, here we go. Your fate is in your hands. Your entire game could change based on a rock draw. Does not rock. MORIAH: Does not rock. -PROBST: All right.

Hunter, Tim and Tevin. All right, Tiff,
you have a big decision to make. Which group are you gonna
put your fate with? It's really tough, Jeff.
I don't know. I think
I'm gonna go with Purple. -Yeah.
-PROBST: All right,
so Tiff has chosen Purple. You will win or lose with them. You'll have a spot at the end. Everybody else, I'm gonna
give you a minute to strategize, and we'll get it on.

Purple has everybody up. Here comes Charlie. You're good. Crate number one. Number one. -MORIAH: Everyone's
got you, girl.
-MARIA: Soda, you got this. You got this, baby. Orange is still
in this challenge. The underdog's got a shot here. CHARLIE:
And lift and push. -Push.
-I can't pull. -Push!
-Push! -(whoops)
-PROBST: Soda's up first. It's gonna be Tim and Tevin on
the first section of the puzzle. The bottom section,
the easier part of this puzzle. CHARLIE:
Good work.
Need a boost? You got it? SODA:
Moriah, take. Look at that. Moriah's up. -Soda pulls up Venus.
-There you go. Go. PROBST:
Here comes Charlie. This
is where it gets really tricky. Soda tries to hold on.
It is hard when you're muddy. You're good. Go to section two. -BEN: Great job, guys.
-Purple has first section done. It's gonna be Kenzie and Ben
now on the second section. Orange has a human ladder built. Everybody trying to help. -MORIAH: You did it!
-PROBST: Charlie's up! TIM:
Take all them out. Take all
them out. Sit 'em on the table. MORIAH:
Soda... PROBST:
Orange is in this. SODA:
Do the first section. Go.
You're fast. Go. HUNTER:
Put yellow on the left side
and blue on the right. Come on. We got this. -SODA: Let's go, guys.
-PROBST: It's gonna be Maria and Liz on the first section
for Orange. -They are in this.
-TEVIN: Just lift that up... PROBST:
Day 13. You never know. One of the most lopsided draws
in Survivor history, but you wouldn't know it looking
at this challenge right now. -Like this.
-No. Flip it up. PROBST:
Ben and Kenzie gonna
start feeling that pressure. -Oh. I'm so sorry.
-That's the other side.
That's the other side. PROBST:
Liz and Maria
feel the opportunity. -Right. Yes. Yes.
-SODA: Perfect! -VENUS: Yes.
-PROBST: There's
another piece for Orange. -TIM: Bottom up.
-Guys... PROBST:
Ben and Kenzie taking their
time. They've got a lead. -BEN: Blue.
-No, that's gonna be white. PROBST:
Trying to orient their pieces. Orange down to their last piece. -Got to get it in there
and you're good.
-Yeah, let's go. -Go.
-You're good. Two new people. It's gonna be Soda and Moriah. Only two pieces behind.
Y'all, we got this. PROBST:
They're moving on
to the second section. -TIM: Why don't we work
from the top down?
-It's Ben and Kenzie working together
and feeling that pressure of Soda and Moriah
on their tail. It is Soda and Moriah on
the same section of the puzzle with Ben and Kenzie. Would anyone have predicted this moments before
we started this challenge? No. You can never predict what's
gonna happen out here. -TIM: There you go.
-TEVIN: Yeah. PROBST:
This section is difficult. That one up there's
flipped over, too. -PROBST: But right now,
we look pretty even.
-TEVIN: Yeah. That one in your hand.
Yes. Right there. PROBST:
Immunity on the line. Ben with another piece
for Purple. -TIFFANY: Hell yeah.
Keep that momentum.
-TIM: Hold it there... -Q: That's it, Kenzie.
-PROBST: Purple
picking up the pace now. Down to just a few pieces
left in this second section. Orange is right on their tail. -LIZ: There you go.
-PROBST: This is close. Stay calm, you guys. PROBST:
Two pieces left for Purple. -Okay, go, go, go, go.
-Go! Jeff! -PROBST: You're good. Move on
to that third and final crate.
-Go! Go! Go! Third section of the puzzle. -We're just one piece behind.
-LIZ: There you go, Mo. -PROBST: Orange is right behind.
-CHARLIE: All right. You're good! Orange is good. Here comes Venus and Charlie... Y'all got to go
fast, guys, fast. ...for the third and final
section of their puzzle. We're back on. That one. That one.
That one. Yes. Purple doing a nice job. -BEN: There you go...
-PROBST: One piece at a time. Can Orange close the gap?
It's Charlie and Venus. All the pressure now on them. TIM:
Bring that triangle down. -You know where it goes.
-PROBST: This is
a very close challenge. Charlie and Venus trying
to catch and pass Hunter and Q. KENZIE:
I know, I know.
You guys are doing so good. (overlapping chatter) -PROBST: Hunter
with another piece.
-Let's go, guys. Yes, Charlie... PROBST:
There's another piece for Orange -and another piece for Purple.
-TIM: There we go. PROBST:
Hunter is on a roll. Go, go, go. You got it. Orange is gonna have to kick it
into high gear right now. That one! That one! PROBST:
It's been a valiant effort,
but they are behind and Purple is close. SODA:
Don't give up.
You got this, guys. BEN:
Right there. Yeah. -PROBST: And another piece
by Hunter.
-(whoops) Comeback. SODA:
You got it. Okay. PROBST:
Purple down
to three pieces left. -Come on, dragon slayers.
-(whoops) PROBST:
This is it, right here,
for the win. (Kenzie whoops) And they've got it. (cheering) Hunter, Q, Tim, Tevin... TEVIN:
Oh, my God! -...Kenzie and Ben.
-(excited chatter) Safe tonight at Tribal Council. -(whoops)
-PROBST: They earn
their merge Buff. They'll enjoy a merge meal. -TIM: Good job, Orange.
Good job, Orange.
-BEN: Good job, Orange. -Good job, Orange.
-Good job, Orange. Good job, y'all. That was tough. You were in it. That was tough. -I don't even care.
-(laughing) All right, Purple,
congratulations. -You have made the merge.
-Yay! -PROBST: Your merge Buffs
inside.
-Want to do it? KENZIE:
We can all do it. We all did it. PROBST:
Put 'em on. Celebrate.
You earned it. Oh, my God! PROBST:
Biggest challenge of the season. Shred red. -KENZIE: Yeah. (exclaims)
-PROBST: All right, so here's
what's gonna happen. You're all going
back to camp together. The seven of you
will have a nice merge meal, separate from everyone else. Everybody goes
to Tribal Council tonight. Everybody votes,
but nobody can vote for you. The only six people
who can be voted for are Moriah, Charlie,
Venus, Liz, Soda and Maria. One of these six--
your journey will end 13 days into Survivor 46.
Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. -Thank you.
-Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you. PROBST:
Head on down. Good job, guys. This was a clear
David versus Goliath situation. And the Davids did really well,
 I feel like. But losing this challenge
 really hurt. I've been on Nami, and
we've been on a winning streak. This is my first Tribal. This is uncharted territory
 for me, which is why I might be,

 is already salivating. I'm-a eat
like a king today, baby. -Merge feast.
-There's our food! TIFFANY:
Oh, my God. Brownies. VENUS:
 There's no Buff.
 There's no feast for Venus. But you know what? I hope they
choke on that food. (chuckles) -(whoops)

if you guys looked over, but I was looking at Tiffany's
face the whole time. She... MORIAH:
 The team that lost
 has three on Nami-- Venus, Soda and Liz-- and three on Siga--
 Maria, Charlie and myself. None of us have Buffs. We know that there are
votes coming to one of us. I need people to look and say, ""Mo ain't a risk."" I can't have people saying, ""She's a strategist.
 She's gonna get us out."" That just can't happen. (excited chatter) -To the merge!
-Merge! -To the merge!
-We did it. This is the making
of an underdog story. This wine is just
hitting, y'all. I'm trying to take it easy
with the wine, 'cause your girl ain't ate. KENZIE:
I think this is a turning point
 for the Yanu tribe. Tiff, Q and I
 have been dealt enough of the bad hands in Survivor. We've gone 11 days
 without flint and food. We-we paid our dues. -With the grapes? This brownie?
-With the grapes. With this whole bottle of wine. (laughing) Tiff, Q and I-- we're all safe. Siga and Nami
 are on the chopping block. So we're all just, like, deciding which way
we want to go. I think we're
in a peculiar position, 'cause we got all of Yanu here. So y'all have an advantage. Siga and Nami
are evenly numbered on the losing tribe. HUNTER:
I can't even vote. -TIFFANY: Damn.
-TEVIN: Ooh. Hunter can't vote, but, on day two, I took
a journey and got an extra vote. And at Tribal Council, there should be an extra vote
 sitting there, waiting for me. TIM:
We vote, right? -KENZIE: Yeah, we all vote.
-TIFFANY: We vote. TEVIN:
 Siga and Nami are even,
 number-wise, and all Yanu's here, which means they're
safe tonight at Tribal Council. So it could be a Nami.
It could be a Siga. So, how you feel
about your tribe, Nami? All I will say
is that from day one-- and I've been
very vocal about it-- is that I don't trust Venus. TIM:
Moriah, Venus and I
talked at the water well, and Venus was
thinking about opportunities. It completely validates
why you may not trust her. I could see
why that would be something you wouldn't want
to work with going forward. Q: Y'all got
to declare somebody, man. -Yeah.
-Well, okay,
so who's y'all's Siga person? BEN:
I feel like it's hard.
I know it sounds like I'm, like, playing a cover, but...
really, we just had that Tribal. I don't want to throw
 anybody's name out from Siga. I really want
 to go Siga strong. But everybody keeps asking,
""Yo, what's up with Siga? You guys got
 to throw a name out there."" -So we got out of that Tribal...
-HUNTER: Who was that? -Jem.
-TIM: Jem. -Jem's gone.
-BEN: Yeah. TIFFANY:
 Siga's kind of beating
 around the bush a little bit. They don't really want
 to throw out a name. They're not really trying
 to work with us, despite the fact that that's the impression
they're trying to give off. If you were, then you
 wouldn't be so tight-lipped about who on your tribe
you were willing to put on the chopping block. Q:
Siga got to declare somebody. KENZIE: Who's a threat? TEVIN:
I was about-- I've heard through
the grapevine that she's savvy. TIFFANY:
I've heard her, like,
spit some crazy Survivor facts. If she know this game like that,
that scare me, dawg. Do you think that Venus or Mo
is more manipulative? TIFFANY:
In my personal opinion,
I would be more intimidated by somebody who's
more knowledgeable than somebody who's just being shiesty, because shiesty
you can sniff out a mile away. Somebody who's smart
could outmaneuver you in a lot of different ways. While they're quickly
 trying to get Venus out, they're basically just showing
 their hand and saying that they're trying
to stay Siga strong. TIM:
I'm not saying Mo's off-limits. I want Venus now.
You have Mo. Let's vote. TIFFANY:
 Because they were
 so willing to vote Venus and more reluctant to say Mo,
it made me want to vote Mo. ( ♪ ♪ ) With Chewy,

 that Venus is a snake and some people agree
that Mo is a threat. CHARLIE:
Hello. -VENUS: Hello. Wow.
-Hey. Yay. TIM:
 At the feast, they said,
 ""We want you to vote for Mo."" Why would I vote
for somebody on my tribe? We want to hear about the feast. BEN:
Come on, don't make us
feel guilty, dude. -MORIAH: I really want to know.
-CHARLIE: No, tell me. TIM:
 Yes, I threw
 Mo's name out there, but I'm trying
 to swing things towards Venus. I am protecting Mo and really protecting
Siga's numbers. -Any talk over there?
-So... Yeah, definitely talks. What's the deal? Everybody had to throw a name. -Okay.
-Nami, it seems like there's
some distrust with Venus. Okay. -For Siga's name...
-Yeah. -I said Mo.
-Okay. And if I was
gonna give 'em a name... -Yeah.
-(scoffs) I'm not
giving 'em Charlie's name. Okay. What I'm hearing
 is Venus and Mo. And I don't want Mo to go, but this is
an incredibly important vote. -Yanu's gonna vote Mo,
but I'm voting Venus.
-So... I'm not gonna
go down in numbers first. Um, Mo's gonna get
a little antsy from that. She is. So with that, we have
to tell her to vote Venus. If it's five of us,
we keep our five. CHARLIE:
 The question is,
 how hard do we push to save Mo at this point? This is the individual part
 of the game. I have to get through this vote. And if Mo going home
is what it takes for me to stay, that's what
has to happen tonight. Right. HUNTER:
 I want to guide this vote,
 even if I can't vote. You need more big sticks? HUNTER:
 Ultimately, I want
 to take out Moriah because Siga is so strong. If we leave Siga in this, it's gonna get tough later. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. Okay? Q:
 Siga is a stronger tribe, right now, than Nami. -SODA: How many hours do
you think we have before Tribal?
-Like, three. Q:
 Siga-- they're trying
 to keep it together. Nami has cracks. So it might be wiser
 for us to side with Nami and vote out Mo. I want your opinion, though. Who do you think
is the right call? Should we do Siga, Nami? I needed just
an honest vibe on... LIZ:
We were like, ""Where's Tiff?"" I was hoping that you weren't
down on the beach. Uh, you got to vote Mo tonight,
if you want to stay. VENUS: ""It's Mo.
 And if you don't vote Mo, it's you."" That really pissed me off. TIFFANY:
This is what happened.
The name from your camp was you. We were waiting a while
for Siga to throw a name out, and they wouldn't.
We need to... -It needs to be a Siga today.
-VENUS: I agree with Siga. I'm unsure about Mo. Let's give it a beat.
Let me talk a little bit more. But for now, we know Siga. TIFFANY:
But I'm just telling y'all, do not say anything, because... -Oh, I'm not gonna
breathe a word.
-TIFFANY: Y'all might... VENUS:
 When someone hears their name,
 it's easy to, like, go into panic mode.
Like, ""Oh, my God."" Like, ""Anything but me."" But I realized, in that moment, this is a stupid vote. Charlie would be a smarter vote. A man needs to go next. Charlie is the only man
 that we can vote out tonight, so I want Charlie gone. Did they say anything else
about Mo? -Specifically? The guys?
-KENZIE: No. VENUS:
I need to understand why Mo. If it's 'cause
she's a superfan alone, you should be scared
for the next vote. That's why
we should think Charlie. Have you picked that up
from Siga's dynamics? -Yeah, but the boys
are super close, extremely.
-Like, why... That's why I was saying Charlie
should be the name, not Mo. It'd be stupid of us
to vote out a girl because the three boys say... Look, all the ... men
went on a feast. (inhales sharply) You're not wrong about that. KENZIE:
 Venus is pissed. She's mad
 that Mo's name is out there. Venus doesn't want to send a girl home,
and so Venus throws out Charlie. This is where
 the plan gets rocky, because if Venus
 would just vote Mo, Mo just goes. Easy. Venus doesn't want Mo. -I know what
Venus has got going on.
-And, see, what scares me is... (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. Mad. Not just like... Q:
I just told Venus
that it's either her or Mo. So if she mad about it,
I'll vote Venus. I'm going Venus. I can't... The girls right now in this game
 have seven to six on the men. Venus don't want
to vote a woman. That's why she was throwing out Charlie's name
at the water well. But I have to make sure Venus understands
I put my game on the line and told you
exactly what is gonna happen. If you gonna be ungrateful... I'll send your ass
back to Canada. -KENZIE: So what are you gonna tell Venus-- Mo? I ain't talking
about Venus no more. -Okay.
-Damn, Venus. TEVIN:
 I'm okay to send Venus home because I have not
trusted Venus since day one. She's been running around
this island alone. I don't know
if she has a Beware Advantage. She's been spinning narratives on me.
 And all of those things line up in a way
 that make me feel like I can't trust Venus at all, and therefore she must go. Tevin will go... And then all of us go... Okay. I am so worried. I-I know my name
has been out there. It is annoying
to hear your name go down, -Mm-hmm.
-but there's more votes on Venus. MORIAH:
 Going into the merge,
 I decided to work with Siga. I fear that I am putting my loyalty and my trust
in the wrong spot. So I feel like I have
 a lot of work to do today to make sure
I'm not going home tonight. TIFFANY:

-HUNTER: Why'd you change it? -Just stick with Mo.
-Venus is moving around, saying all kinds of ... -What'd she say?
-HUNTER: Venus gonna
get herself voted out. TEVIN:
He also doesn't like
that Venus is playing a game that we don't want
to vote out none of the women. She says she don't want
to vote no women out. HUNTER:
Who's she gonna vote out? Then why
are we worried about it? Things are kind of chaotic
right now because whoever goes home tonight, Mo or Venus is
gonna be the determining factor of the trajectory
 of the next couple of votes. On paper, Yanu has a really large say
 in tonight's vote, but based
 on how conversations go, that could quickly change. All I know is that
 I'm glad I'm safe tonight because, baby,

For whom it is
your first time at Tribal, grab an unlit torch,
dip it in and get fire. This is part
of the ritual at Tribal Council because in this game,
fire represents your life. When your fire's gone,
so are you. All right. A lot going on.
13 people here. Seven are safe, six are not. Tevin, the juxtaposition
of having more than half the group completely safe is very unusual
at Tribal Council. The perfect word that you
just used is ""juxtaposition,"" because though I am protected, I still have to be very aware
of what is happening at this Tribal Council,
because this will add up to what will happen when I'm inevitably
maybe not safe at the next one. PROBST:
Q, what is it like having seven people that are safe? So, for me, Jeff, I'm just happy
that I'm one of the seven that has this so far,
because going back to camp after that feast was like
my little brother kicking over an ant pile and the ants
just started running at me. -(laughing)
-It was like,
""You had time to eat, buddy. Now, it's time to talk."" And we'll see where
things kind of shake up. PROBST:
So, Charlie, as one of the six, can you try to move the game
in a direction you want? Being part of the six, I feel
like I'm a goalkeeper, you know? I have a goal,
and I'm not taking any shots. All I'm doing is blocking,
you know? I'm just listening. If I hear the name Charlie,
I got to get to work. How about for you, Venus?
Can you still play offensively even though you're trying
to make sure it's not you? Oh, 100%, Jeff.
You never give up. None of us want our names
written down, but, also, like, if the kings of the castle
over there, who already have their Buffs,
say a name, you have to listen out
for whether or not your name's being said and to
move that target off your back. So, Hunter, how is it decided
who you're gonna vote for? HUNTER:
Yeah, I don't have a say in this
vote, and so I'll break the ice. The Yanu has
the choice right now, and they have to choose
who's gonna lose a number: Siga or Nami.
And right now Siga is really, really close. Like, the cloud nine of vibes. And, Moriah,
that's what Hunter should do-- throw it on another tribe,
not his. Yeah, I mean,
I'd be lying if I said we weren't doing the same, but I'll let you all
in a little secret here. It was not unanimous
at the last Tribal Council. I was the odd out. I didn't get the vote right. I am on the damn bottom,
and I do not fit in. HUNTER:
But perception
is just reality, though. Like, none of us knew that -because y'all
did such a good job.
-Yeah. And so
if that was the case, like, -you have to help us
with our perceptions.
-MORIAH: Yeah. Yeah, and I'm-I'm helping
you along as I can. I mean... Well, you're talking
to the guy who can't vote. -Yeah.
-(laughing) I think I'm talking
pretty loudly to the guy that can't vote. -(laughs)
-But the question
really is up to Yanu. Q, in a game all about numbers, Moriah just said,
""I'm not a part of that group."" Is that appealing? It's appealing, Jeff,
if I feel like the information is accurate, because this
is the first time I'm personally hearing that
she was on the bottom. Q, I'm serving it up to you
on a silver platter here. -But I'm a man of truth.
-Yeah? Q:
And in one conversation that we had,
I asked a simple question. MORIAH:
Yeah. Q:
What went on at Tribal for Siga? That probably
would have been a time to say, ""I am on the bottom.
I need help."" But instead, I was told
that the vote was unanimous. So, Moriah,
are you playing for Siga or are you playing for you? I'm playing for me.
I want that merge Buff. If you were on the bottom,
why not express that? -You see what I'm saying?
-Yeah. Don't let anyone
mute you in this game if you feel like
you're on the bottom. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Q: That's valuable information. -MORIAH: Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. PROBST:
Tim, weigh in on this, because a lot
of information is coming out and it is a showdown
between two tribes, with the Yanu three
in the middle. Yeah, I mean, they were kind of
forced to make a decision on choosing someone from Nami
or choosing someone from Siga. And so at the feast,
we went around the table and everybody
that had a vote said a name. And at the feast, we left
with a clear understanding of who might be voting for who
at tonight's Tribal Council. Charlie, did you hear your name? I heard whispers,
but my way of dealing with the whispers is to go
to the people that I trust, that I've connected with,
that I've spoken with, and saying, ""Do I need
to go scramble like crazy or was this just a whisper?"" Venus, did you hear your name? Oh, yeah. A lot. Plenty of times.
A terrifying amount of times. But you can't
let that get to you. I mean, realistically,
I hope the people around me are smart enough to see
the value I could bring to them, and if they're as smart of
a player that I think they are, they'll probably want to keep me
around over someone else. So, Moriah, how are you feeling? You pitched a case.
People seem to be hearing it. Are you feeling
optimistic or pessimistic? I know what
I wanted to say today. I'll tell you right now, I might
be the most honest person at this Tribal Council.
And, you know, there's important information
out here. I know how whispers fly
and how whispers go, and I wanted
to say it loud and clear for all of you
to hear what happened. And I'm feeling very satisfied with my message. All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. Let's do it. ♪ ♪ (mutters) ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or

 Oh, my God.

 because, baby, it's about to get messy. First vote: Venus. Sixth person voted out
of Survivor 46: Moriah.
That's six. That's enough. The tribe has spoken. Congrats on the first Tribal
for some of y'all. -Wasn't that intense?
That was...
-It was bad. -That was really intense.
-BEN: Whoa. That was really, like, bad. VENUS:
 My first Tribal was mind-blowing. Seeing my name written down
on a piece of parchment as the very first vote--
it was just terrible. But the fact that there was just
 only one vote with my name and the rest was straight Mo-- I automatically knew that Soda
 wrote my name down because that's the only thing
that could possibly make sense. Oh... Sure. Our relationship has been
a question mark for a while now. I really wish
I could have worked with her, but I'm also not stupid. I know that I'm loyal, but the way that you were being
evasive with your answers... That's why I... that's why I came to you the way
that I did, because it's alarming to me that you,
like, went straight for me in the attitude
that you did, though. I'll be straight up with you. I needed a moment
'cause I know I snapped. No, that's fine
that you needed a moment, but you did snap
at the same time. Like, it is fine
that you needed a moment. I didn't want to raise my voice. No, but you still were, like,
""You voted for me."" TEVIN: Watching Soda and Venus is kind of the hottest tea
of the night. I told Soda I don't trust Venus,
I don't trust where she stands, I don't trust her loyalty, and I think that she'll flip
 any second that she gets. Soda hasn't listened to me,
 and now they are digging
their own graves and showing the people how toxic and dangerous they are
to the game. And I hope that they continue
 to do that because it will slide them closer to
that snuffer and keep me closer to that million dollars. CHARLIE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you want to chat one-on-one,
or, like, I can explain now. -VENUS: We can talk
in the morning.
-CHARLIE: Okay. Yeah. Q:
 Charlie put a vote
 on Venus anonymously. So, for Venus to come back
and to now think that Soda wrote her name down was gonna be the perfect plan. I need Nami to be in panic mode. But Charlie lets his emotions
 get the best of him, and he confesses to Venus that he is the one that wrote her name down. In this game, we cannot have that going on. And I think he needed to be put in his place. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, man.
You are right. I messed up here.
I messed up here. -I'm with you.
-You know what I told you? -Yeah.
-Do not let your emotions -get you in this game.
-Yeah. You don't have to admit ...
to nobody. You're right. You're right. Q's real mad at me for telling Venus
that I voted for her. And in this moment,
 I'm just saying, ""I'm sorry,"" and just letting him know
 that we're solid. But what I'm thinking is, Q is running this show, and no one is allowed
 to have any other ideas. ""We're doing this,
 we're locking it down, ""we're getting to the end, we're doing it Q's way
 or it's the highway."" So... I need to get Q

so, Kenzie, you're safe tonight. -Yep.
-The six of you will go
to Tribal Council first, where, sadly,
the person voted out will not make the jury. One last thing. You're not going back to camp. You're going back
to the old Siga camp. All right, swim out. See you
tonight at Tribal Council. All right, see you later, Jeff. HUNTER:
 Nobody wants to be the person
 that's chopped off right before
 they make it to the jury, and I am the odd man out. So I need to play my idol
 to get me to that jury, to get another day, to get back
to Tevin and to the Nami people. And if that's what it takes
 to get there, then that's what I'll do. There is simply
nothing like Survivor. It tests you on so many levels and offers you nowhere to hide. If that sounds like fun,

-TEVIN: Lord, -have mercy.
-you guys, first feast! TEVIN: Oh!
-SODA: See, this is why
I wasn't worried. (indistinct chatter) CHARLIE:
Maria and Tevin. Our angels. MARIA:
 The immunity challenge was a dream come true. Not only did I win immunity.
 I won reward for our group, which
meant we finally got to eat. -Cheers. To Maria and Tevin.
-Cheers. -SODA: To the merge feast,
thanks to Maria and Tevin.
-Yes. Yes. (overlapping chatter) CHARLIE:
Oh, man, this is so good. SODA:
This coffee is so good. Wow. VENUS:
 Winning this means everything. Maria, my girl-- she really
 pulled it out for us, and she basically gave us
a second life in this game. Like, we were given a feast that is gonna energize
 us for future challenges. But even more than that,
 she basically guaranteed that we're all at least
 gonna make the jury, which is huge, you know, and, you know, coming in,
it seems obvious. You know, there's four Nami,
 there's two Siga-- Charlie and Maria. And Maria has
 the immunity necklace. Who's the obvious vote? Charlie, my guy who put my name down
the last vote is unfortunately up on the chopping block. Oh, my God. TEVIN:
Can we cheers? We are all
at least on the jury. We will be... (cheering) TEVIN:
 From the outside looking in, you would automatically think,
 ""Oh, there's four Nami, there's two Siga, Maria's safe."" So, I think
that people would assume that Charlie would be
the one going home because he's not in the numbers. However,
 Maria and I know different. We understand
 that there is another game being played
 that is across tribal lines. So we see that it's not
Nami versus Siga here. And so, tonight is the night
that I want to make a big move. I want to be the curator of the
first blindside of the season. Poor Hunter is all alone
over there. MARIA:
That's gonna be, like,
massive strategy -over there right now.
-Yeah. ♪ ♪ -BEN: It ain't too far off.
-TIFFANY: Oh, my God. (laughing) -Nice job, Kenzie.
-KENZIE: Thank you. BEN:
Yeah, you crushed. TIM:
It was tough out there. Coming out here, I didn't expect
to do super well in challenges. Like, of course I'm gonna give
it my all. I'm not a quitter. But it's such an accomplishment that I didn't think I would get
 to check off my bucket list. Yanu started so bad.
Like, I never thought I was even gonna
get this opportunity. And now, I just feel like
I'm, like... really gaining some footing
in this game. It's just a really,
 really good feeling. Soda and Q she needs
to land a talk show after this. That was so funny. KENZIE: You were just out there
having a good time today. Q:
So far in this game, I have yet
 to really show my ability. That was by design.
 I didn't want a target on me. So in today's challenge, I jumped off on purpose to see if my alliance
 was really strong. So I wanted to go
 into this first immunity not immune at all. Oh, my goodness. -Hunter's Nami, though.
Is he not?
-Yeah. TIM:
This is like a Christmas present that we have to open. It is a gift-wrapped opportunity because Hunter is alone. Yes, we've made agreements
 with Hunter, but it's not about the alliance. Hunter's a beast
 in challenges, and now that we have him pinned,
let's take him out. He's part of the six. Are you gonna beat him
in an individual immunity? Me? I can. Yeah. That's okay.
Ain't nobody in this game gonna ever win ten
individual immunities. Nobody. Tim feel like Hunter is the most physical threat here, which-- debatable, but I would rather go against a physical threat than one that somewhat has some skills off the gridiron competing. All right. Because I committed
to the six thing with you, Maria, him, Tevin and Tiff. The point is Nami. Nami got the most numbers. Nami was the target. So after today, once again,
Nami's gonna outweigh everybody, and they can control anything. Q:
 Tim right now is trying
to position himself in this game to get to the end
in multiple ways. He wants to have
the plus-one alliance, but he also wants
to have his Siga alliance. He also wants to have
 his sub-alliance with Ben. Which is it, Tim? Which game are you playing?

 I've been thrown in
 to the lion's den. The Nami lion's den.
 It's four Namis, two Sigas-- me and my ride-or-die: Maria. So that's the one lifeline I have out here is I've got the person
I trust most in this game. But if they stick together,
 I'm gone. There is zero other possibility. Oh, a fed nap is
a really great feeling. -Uh-huh.
-I'm drifting off. I may snore. CHARLIE:
 We're napping right now? You guys don't know what it's like to be,
you know, me on this day. You know, I wanted
immediate conversations. As I'm laying there,
 I'm hoping I'm gonna catch some eyes, you know, that someone's gonna
look at me and just go... But I'm just losing it. Calm on the outside,
 but losing it on the inside. I want someone to get up
so I can go talk right away. SODA (with British accent):
Charlie. (regular accent):
I mean, there's literally
four Nami and two Siga, -and you're the only other Siga
that can be voted.
-Oh. SODA:
 Anyone from the outside
 looking in would say Charlie is the easy vote
 tonight. Charlie's literally
the only person we can vote for if we want to be ""Nami strong."" But I don't want that to happen
 because Charlie's somebody who I feel is very loyal
 and likes me and just wants to work with me. I'd rather have that than Venus, because over these
 past few days, she's been, like,
 sus about me because I haven't been doing
 one-on-one strategy with her. And then last night,
 after Tribal, she came for me and said,
I wrote her name down. That tells me
you don't trust me. It's four Nami and one you. -Yeah.
-I'm not gonna vote that way. And I'm gonna talk to Tevin. So we have to really,
really make it... No, I get it. I understand. I'm nervous, but I trust you. -I got you. I got you, Charlie.
You're okay.
-Soda. SODA:
 We are not gonna go
 with the majority. That's the story,
is that it's gonna be Charlie because of the numbers, but
we're really going after Venus. I told Charlie,
I just talked to him because I really love Charlie. I don't know
who your vibe with. He... And Maria, too.
Let's... let me tell you. He's loyal, and he loves us,
and I have him. Like, we're very tight. But
I think we should go for Venus tonight. I think
it has to happen tonight. TEVIN:
 Soda's right.
 Venus has been shifty. She is flopping, she's flipping, and she is
potentially threatening to the alliances
that I've already built. -We're-we're on the same team.
-Okay. We're always on the same page--
you and I. Always. We don't even need
to have long chats. TEVIN:
 But to be honest,
 Soda and I's relationship has been a little bit
 distant because she talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk. Like Yam Yam say, ""You talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."" She talks, and she's good at making every single person
 feel comfortable. And for that reason,
 I can't necessarily read her. That's why I have kind of
separated myself from Soda, alliance-wise. And so the time has come. Try to make a big move, because
 now is the time to start really, really building résumé, because we're heading
to the end of the game. The plan is
to make V feel comfortable so don't play
her Shot in the Dark. And we vote V out and tell her that the plan
is to vote Charlie. That's an option. The other option is... it could be a blindside tonight
against Soda. Because V is the one
that thinks she's going. Right. Right. I believe the Survivor gods are smiling upon me. And honestly,
I've been waiting to lose. I've been wanting Soda out so bad. She is my number one target. She's a big threat in this game. Oh. Sure, we have a connection because we're Nami, but I don't care about Nami strong. Soda has to go. I know what kind of game
Venus is playing, and everyone is all
on board with, like... Venus is snaking, but we also have a chance
to get out Soda, and she doesn't expect it. I just don't know what kind of game
Soda's playing. So your proposition is -that we all vote Soda?
-Soda. TEVIN:
 I trust Maria. She's in the plus-one alliance. I trust her.
I-I know she's there for me. Oh, you just sit there
and let people come to you. Your turn with the Tev? TEVIN:
 My gut tells me
 that I can trust Charlie. Charlie's very loyal and sweet and nice
and he wants to work with me. You ain't going nowhere tonight. So, you, me, Liz and Maria
vote Soda. Okay. And then we tell Soda we're all voting Venus,
which she wants to do anyway. -Okay.
-Then you're still safe. CHARLIE:
 When we got back to camp, I was scared out of my mind. And now I've heard Venus
and I've heard Soda already, and I'm thinking,
 ""What is going on on this beach?"" I don't like it when I'm not
included in conversations. It's obvious
 we should vote for Charlie. But for me, I now have the clarity to realize that that's not the only way
in this game. Yes, Charlie
 seems like the easy vote, but I'm not here
 to do easy votes. I'm here to play a hard game.
And, sure, playing with fire could come back
and bite me in the ass, but I want to play with fire. I want to make big moves. I want to make
a name for myself here and show people that I'm
not someone to mess around with. What are you thinking
in terms of threat level -between Soda and Tevin?
-I have no idea. Honestly, like,
I can't tell you, at this point. But if I were to say,
""Hey, let's throw it on Tevin,"" 'cause I just personally
see him as a bigger threat -Right.
-socially and physically. MARIA:
 Poor Venus. Venus is trying really hard to get some footing
 in this game, but Venus is pretty oblivious. She's not
 reading the room very well. She threw out Tevin's name,
and so I think that's a mistake. Tevin and I are part
of an alliance of six. And in my perspective,
Tevin was never an option. -No committing.
-No committing. I don't want to, like,
make you say, ""Well, oh, gosh, she told me this and then,
like, she turned on me."" Like, not committing. -I want to talk
to everybody again.
-Ah, so, as in, -you may want
to work with Tevin instead?
-No, no, no. I want to talk. VENUS:
 Maria's hard to read. And I'm providing her
 with a really good opportunity and she was unsure
 of even working with me. So I don't know
 why she's wary of me, but, realistically, she's
putting her Siga numbers at risk by not trusting me. So I just
 need to talk to Charlie and hope that
 I can pull something out. And I am, like, stressing. I really don't care
that you wrote my name down, and I could see myself
potentially working with you. 'Cause I'm gonna
be real with you. -I would rather you stay here.
-Okay. I don't know if you've noticed
how close Tevin and Soda are. CHARLIE:
Yeah, I've seen it. The most important thing
right now -is to break the two of them up.
-Okay. I'm impartial to which one.
I have two suggestions. The option's vote Soda,
and we blindside her tonight. -Okay.
-Option two
is if I tell Liz ""Soda,"" Soda and Tevin think it's you, -and then me, you,
Maria vote Tevin.
-Like, a three... -Yeah. Like a three,
two, one. Yeah.
-Three, two, one. CHARLIE:
 Venus says, ""Number one,
we could vote out Soda."" Then she's got this plan where she wants
 to do a blindside on Tevin. -I'm gonna go off.
-Okay. Um, and we need to connect
at least one more time, -'cause things change
so-so quickly.
-Yeah. It's becoming clear to me that the cracks on Nami

-Ah. I'm open to working,
but, like, don't pressure me. And when I say I'm gonna
do something, I'm doing it. Venus just kind of came at me,
 and I'm like, ""Listen, you're 20. Like,
 I've been there, done that."" And so I was really put off
by her demeanor. And, honestly,
 I don't trust Venus. She's conniving. She's sneaky. She is dangerous. I don't know. Lack of s... Like, I'm putting, like...
We're putting a lot on the line. So, like, this lack
of certainty, if anything, it's kind of, like, scaring me
off on the idea as a whole. Maria said that
 she felt like I was telling her what to do,
 which, honestly, like, I feel like that's her ego
getting in the way of the game. I wasn't trying to pressure
you into an idea. 'Cause at the end
of the day, it's your game. -You can do whatever you want.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what? I'm gonna go. VENUS:
 She's probably used to calling
the shots and doesn't like being told what to do by someone she
probably considers her junior. So I'm a little bit
 in panic mode. This really is a ""make it or break it"" moment
for me in this game. Here's where I stand.
I'm down for Soda. I thought I could
get Maria on board, but I don't know if I can. -You know what I mean?
-For Soda? -Yeah.
-So, it's abort. I mean, I-I might just have to, like, consider
playing my Shot in the Dark or something, you know? VENUS:
 I'm scared.
 Charlie could potentially play a Shot in the Dark--
in which case, if he's safe, whatever
the other name is would go home. And that name
would most likely be mine. If you're saying it's like this,
then I'm gonna be honest. I'm just gonna stick
with the Nami four, -'cause that's
just the safest thing.
-No... The only person who I'm gonna believe wholeheartedly
 right now is Maria. I want Maria
to be cool with any plans that we lock ourselves into. I'm hearing from Venus... Yeah. And then Soda wants it,
obviously, just to be Venus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -So, apparently, I'm okay.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 With this split that we have
 where there are two Tribal Councils, two people being voted out
in one night, Maria and I, all of a sudden-- the two Sigas
 on a tribe with four Namis-- have the power. At Tribal tonight, -are we pretending...
-For me, it's easy. I'm just gonna be like, ""Listen, I'm the only Siga
who can catch votes."" Tonight has transformed
 from a night where I was gonna be shaking
in my boots at Tribal Council because I thought I was
 going home to a night where I'm making, probably,
the biggest decision of my game. Everyone on the beach has been
talking about getting Venus out. Venus is totally chaotic
 and unpredictable. I don't think I can
 trust her with anything. But Soda-- extremely social player.
 She's a huge threat. So if Maria and I can come out
 of this situation down two to four in numbers
and, ultimately, make the call
 on what happens tonight, we can take control
 of this game. ♪ ♪ No, I feel good with this. So we're gonna have to split
the votes between Hunter, Ben. TIFFANY:
I think I'm all right with that. TIM:
Only because we think
the biggest threat here on this Siga camp right now is Hunter. -One, two, three...
 -TIFFANY: We just gonna
 have to do damage control when we get back to Tevin. But I think
Tevin'll be fine, though. He'll be fine. Yeah.
He's, like... -Like, he's...
-I think Tevin will be fine. -'Cause Tevin
really rocks with us, so...
-There's five... TIFFANY:
 Tim's logic is Hunter's
the biggest threat on the beach. But what I know for certain: it's not about
 Hunter being a threat. It's less about Hunter being
a threat and more about the fact that they are thirsty
to get a Nami player out because a Siga player went home last night. They're still trying
to chip away at Nami's numbers. I don't care about
chipping away at Nami's numbers, 'cause I know I could do that
easily on my own. (blows raspberry) -(whispers): Tim?
-(whispers): Yes. -TIFFANY: Yeah. Yeah.
No, first of all...
-Why? TIFFANY:
He's-he's getting real shifty. Okay. Okay. I'm good with that. TIFFANY:
My only hesitation right now is if we leave Ben in the game it's gonna be harder
to get him out, 'cause now
he's gonna be on high alert. I, personally, think that Ben
is a bigger threat than Tim. I can see through Tim. He thinks he's a good liar.
 He's not. Ben-- I think
 he's a sneakier player. He might be
 a secret agent of chaos. So in my perfect world,
Ben would go home tonight and Tim would stay. Yes. Yes. Bro. Tim got to go. HUNTER: The plan tonight
 is to get the four of us-- the three Yanu and me--
to all vote for Tim. What could go wrong
 is they're all lying to me, and the Yanu people vote me out. There's no doubt
 I'm nervous going into this, but I have an idol
 that nobody knows about, and if I have to play the idol,
then I'll just play it. And if I look crazy because no
 one voted for me, that's that. But if that's what it takes, then that's what I'll do. BEN:
 There's only, like, a couple
 options happening tonight. Obviously, my name
being one of them, right? -Yeah.
-But, um, what are you feeling? I think that we're all
open-minded, is the thing. And we also don't want Nami
to have all the numbers. It's harder to lie to a friend,
 and Ben and I have bonded. He's just, like, such
a sweet and kind, gentle person. And Ben had a panic attack
 that I was there for him for. So Ben and I have formed this,
 like, friendship. That's why this game
 is so complicated, because it's hard to figure out who I, like,
like as a person versus who
I'm gonna work with long-term. I mean, what do you and Tim
want to do-- go Hunter? BEN:
For numbers, it makes sense. The only thing
that makes sense is to try -and equalize
the entire playing field.
-Exactly. BEN:
 My biggest hope tonight is that I can convince
 the Yanu three into going Hunter,
 or else I'm screwed. That simple.
You know, like, Kenzie-- she looked hesitant,
but I don't have much to go on. I'm in a tough corner, but you can't go down
not swinging. The reason I'm talking to you,
straight up, is, like,
I know we haven't had a moment. -And I know Tim and you vibe.
-Correct. -So...
-Listen, let... -Man, you got to just
make me comfortable, bro.
-I hear you. Who are we gonna tell Hunter
we voting for-- you? I think we might have
to do a cover like that. But you cool with... We gonna tell this man
to write your name down. -Yeah.
-I write his name down. -Yeah.
-He stands his ass up, he play something,
and he wrote your name down. -Then what?
-Yeah, then I'm screwed. But that's Survivor, right?
You got to take a chance. But I'm just making sure
you aware... That my name could be... -Yeah.
-When you on the island... But what do they say
in Survivor? -No risk, no reward.
-No reward. BEN:
 Would it suck
 to be taken out tonight? Sure. But it's like gambling. If you pulled this off, I would feel high
the rest of the game. You know, in the words
 of the mighty Van Halen, ""Time to go bottoms up."" No, no, no. Listen. He said he's fine with
 Hunter writing his name down. And if Hunter has an idol
 or something, he plays it, he's fine with going home. So... Yeah. 100%. I don't know.
I can only go on what I read. He's not comfortable.
He's not comfortable going home. I'm not a sucker. I'm smarter
than what you think. I promise. I'm telling you,
that was a bluff. Q:
Okay. So do you want to go Tim? Dude, I just told you
what I wanted to do. I want to vote for Ben. I'm just telling you
what I'm observing. KENZIE:
 Q is the type of person where we'll have a conversation.
He'll be like, ""Tim is the vote."" I'm like,
""Perfect."" I walk away. I come back from the water well,
and he's like, ""It's Ben."" And I'm like, ""Q, what happened? ""Like, you can't just do this. ""What if we have to go to Tribal ""and you don't get a second to
 tell me that the vote changed? ""And why is it
you are the only one ""who's deciding
the way the votes go? ""Like, we're a three. We're supposed
to be working together."" I would rather see Ben go. -TIFFANY: Well, that's what I've
been saying since we got here.
-And we just... And if... If the three of us
are in it together, let's take the shot at Ben. -Just so you know.
-Ben ain't playing anything now. -Yes, he is.
-Well, do you
want to go Tim, then? TIFFANY:
 The stakes are high right now, but Q keeps flip-flopping
 back and forth. Like, ""All right,
we're doing this."" And then you step away,
and he come back, ""No, no, no. We're doing this."" You can't do that.
 This is a conversation. You're not just telling us
where to place our votes. -Q is working everyone.
-He is. ""So do you want Tim?"" If you don't shut your ass up... He's gonna come back
and be like, ""Vote me, yo. -I've decided."" (laughs)
-Oh, God. I'd be like, ""Okay, boy."" This is not the Q show. At some point, -that ain't gonna work for us.
-Uh-uh. The way Q is approaching
 stuff right now is worrisome. However, I've got my girl Tiff. The three of us have been strong
this whole time, but the way Q is barking orders at us has Tiff and I being aware that this could go into chaos mode very quickly. The plan right now is that we'll
 vote out either Tim or Ben. Tiff and I need

what was it like this afternoon with only six people
knowing Tribal was looming? First thing I noticed, a tornado had to
come through Siga's camp between the time they left
and when we got there. 'Cause it was awful.
They was living rough. But we had
to start talking plans, making this game fair, because
Yanu only has three members. Nami and Siga
still has the advantage when it comes to numbers. So if we send
the right person home, it could even those numbers out
a little more. But, Hunter, at what point
do Tribal lines disappear and it becomes, ""This
is who I want to play with because I can
see my path to the end""? Yeah. It's this weird spot
where the Yanu three are in a power position,
because I'm here by myself, and there's
two Sigas over there, but the majority
falls with Yanu. I am the only person who
has not voted with any group. And so I would love
to be a Yanu member right now. So, Kenzie, Hunter's saying, ""I'm willing to join Yanu three. Make it Yanu four."" -(laughing)
-Yeah. Okay. Hunter's a free agent,
so that's appealing. That's a number,
but at the same time, Nami has the numbers. What way do we take it? Do we adopt one
and hope that he's... You hope he's our baby? Or do we, like, chance it that he's gonna go back
with his original family? It's-it's a toss-up. PROBST:
And so, Tim, if we stay
with this train of thought, you and Ben would be saying,
""No, no, no, take out Hunter. Let's get Nami."" TIM:
Yeah, I mean,
it's an individual game, and you're not really
thinking about the alliance. You're thinking about
who's threatening. And I think Hunter has carried Nami the entire game by leading and dominating in every single challenge. Yeah, but I'm not tied
to Nami in any real way other than
I had to get them here so they wouldn't vote me out. And I'm telling you,
this Nami group is not even getting along when the Siga
group is really, really close. And it was clear at last Tribal, the four that have been working
together are still here and still trying
to work together. TIM:
I love that Hunter just loves how
Siga has been able to operate. It's like, ""Siga did this"" or ""Siga kept a close, tight lip,"" but he's never had to show any allegiance to anyone. He's never sat here
and had to make a decision about one of the individuals
that sit amongst him. And I'm assuming he's saying
that's a hard thing to do, which I haven't bonded
to somebody in that way, and I'm looking to do
it tonight with these three. PROBST:
Ben, it's very clear that Siga
was trying to work on Hunter and Hunter was trying
to work on you two. I haven't heard
either of you say that you were trying
to work on each other. I mean,
I'd be lying if I hadn't heard people try
to break me and Tim up. How do you respond to that? BEN:
Well, it's like,
I try to be personal. I know this
is a game of deception, but, like,
it makes it really hard to separate the personal
from the game. And I know it might sound like an open target saying that here, but, like, you know,
I had a panic attack last night. It wasn't so much about the game as just being like, ""Wow. So much
intense negativity. How am I gonna
keep a straight mind?"" I don't know
which other way to say it. Kenzie woke up at 1:00 a.m.
to make sure I was doing okay. That was something human,
which is very hard in this game. -That was human.
-It... Yeah. Like, I would be there for you
no matter what. It makes me want to cry now,
'cause it's like, when do you get those moments
in this kind of game? I came into this game thinking I was gonna be on the bottom
the whole time for how I am as a human
in an individual society. I'm usually people's, like,
entertainment monkey that, like, they like
having around at a party, but don't want to get deep with.
But, like, it wasn't that case. It was a breath of fresh air
where it's like, ""Wow, we've actually
made bonds that I think might go beyond this game."" And then to bring it back
to what we were saying before about me and Tim, all we can do
is try and play our game. It's like,
we came and did our thing and if that's what got us
in the end, so be it. But, like,
what a beautiful ride it was. You don't get an adventure
like this or make bonds like this
very often. Sorry, I know that was a lot. It was great. Beautiful. Kenzie, if it really
is the Yanu three in charge and your choices
are Hunter, Tim or Ben, it's got to be
a bit of a Sophie's choice in terms of humans,
because they all three have made very compelling,
likable cases tonight. This is really hard for me because I wouldn't be here
without these boys. Like, they literally threw me
through the merge. Sorry. And, you know, I wouldn't be able to, like,
have won this without these boys and Tiff, obviously,
but, you know, um... And I've bonded
with all of them, deeply. So when we were all on the same
team today, I was devastated. And the fact that now
it's up to me to decide, like, which one to cut is a hard pill for me to swallow. It's tough, because, yeah,
like, I, like, held Ben's hand
last night, and, like,
I've talked to Hunter, I've talked to Tim,
I've talked to everyone here on a deep level,
and it is so human. And that's how
I make my money at home, is building human connections. So, it-it gets hard for me to separate. Jeff, I know you didn't
ask me a question, but I want to recognize, amongst all these giants, today in the challenge, the smallest person
standing amongst us won. When Yanu went 11 days without any positivity,
that girl right there-- she smiled, she cried,
she kept it together. That deserves more recognition
than we're giving. And I understand
we have to vote, I do, but I have to give credit
where credit is due. -Kenzie, you did an amazing job.
-(laughs) -Thank you.
-You did.
-All right, Kenzie! You did an amazing job. Thank you. PROBST:
So I'm getting the impression this is going to be
a tough vote tonight. It's gonna be
a very tough vote, Jeff. Yeah. All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. ♪ ♪ Sh op E ts y un ti l Ma y 12 th for up to 30% off

is this tribe right now? 'Cause, for a moment, you were
all together as individuals, -but then now you're back into
two groups in a small group.
-Yeah. I, actually,
am really excited that we're split into two groups. For my game, I made a lot of friendships and connections on both sides. So, for the individual game, if you're in the right spot, you're in a good spot tonight,
no matter what happens. Charlie, what do
you read into that answer? It's a very interesting comment. I find it fitting
for a person who's in here with four
of their former Tribemates. There's a little bit more
comfort where Liz is sitting. For me, you get
divided onto a tribe where you're the odd tribe out and the only person
vulnerable on that tribe-- it's like I have
a big, red target painted on my forehead. Soda, can you appreciate
how that might feel? Might be accurate, might not be. Yeah, I can, I can...
Like, I mean, it was... I felt it for him, and I, like, I don't think there's any way
kind of around it as much as, like, I adore him as a person. It's kind of clear where the numbers
really are, so... PROBST:
But, Tevin, we also reached
a new phase of the game where it's not
always that simple. That's true. But, I mean,
just last Tribal Council, you heard the kind of division
between the two tribes, still. And I don't know
if people are necessarily willing to let down
the tribal lines right now, and they are still trying
to play a tribe game because they're scared that one tribe
may pick off the other. PROBST:
Venus, where do you sit? The easy vote would be
for the four of you to stick together
and take out Charlie, and there's not really
anything he could do other than maybe
he has some power in the game -or he could play
a Shot in the Dark.
-Exactly what you said, Jeff. It's a pretty easy vote, but,
um, unlike Soda, I feel like my butt is more on the line
because it's no real secret here that, the other night,
Charlie wrote my name down. So if anyone here really
has to be worried, it's me. PROBST:
Maria, if you want
to try to take somebody out, six people
is a great opportunity, because there's nowhere to hide. Um, I'm gonna paint
a picture for you. -Mm.
-You're having a party. You get gussied up
and you put on, like, your favorite red necklace. And you wait
for your guests to come. (chuckles) And maybe they don't come. So no one approached you? It's not that
nobody approached me. It just didn't feel
like I had the power. It just kind of felt like,
you know, maybe they stayed for a little bit,
but not too long. I'm sorry
you got all gussied up. (laughing) Y'all, I didn't
bring my bag tonight. I am staying Nami strong. That's that. Ready to go
back to the fire and get warm. I mean, that
is a lot of confidence. Soda, is that just the luxury that comes
with having the numbers? Yeah, it's, like, the luxury
of having four Nami right now. You know, and, like,
that's the thing. That's the big steak on the plate right now. So how does that
change the dynamic for the six of you? What did you notice
in terms of behavior? We were just more like,
""I don't need to run around,"" which is very, very different
from yesterday. Feeling like
you have your tribe there, like, a majority of
your brain space is not worried. You could see that
in people's physical movement in their body. So, Charlie, what's it like to hear Liz say, ""I didn't even bring my bag""? CHARLIE:
Not great. Um... You know,
I knew what the odds were as soon as Maria was the one
that won that immunity. And I did my best today
to just pitch myself to every single person here. And it's so hard
in the new era, because, you know, I have this
little number in my pocket. Little Shot in the Dark die. And that makes it so people will give me
a little bit to work with. But I don't know if I can
believe one word of it, 'cause they don't want this
to come out. It's a one in six shot. There are only six people here. That's still scary. I just want to say,
realistically, Jeff, I feel like I already know the
move that they're gonna play. The fact that
my name was written down not only one Tribal ago,
like, it's very clear to me that that's
gonna be their move today. And I'm just hoping that

who has caught fish, but Rome has also been the one who's been
 using the fishing gear for a majority of the time. Yeah. (groans) -You okay?
-Yeah, just... AYSHA:
Exactly. TEENY:
Yeah. I think I just
have a different mindset. Like, if somebody was
catching fish for me, like, bro, I'd be
getting the pot ready. I'd be trying to make a fire. -Yeah.
-This is just ridiculous, man. AYSHA:
 I bet you -he thinks we're so lazy.
-TEENY: He does. We're spending
 24 hours a day together, and that's obviously going to expose us
in our raw forms-- what our annoyances are, what our patience levels are. ROME:
Yo! There was a shark about
ten feet away from me just now. I know. (laughs) TEENY:
 Which, for me, works out
 perfectly because Rome is a large personality person. Why didn't
you bring the flippers? I hate flippers, but, uh,
no flippers, no problem. (excited chatter) ROME:
 And I realized, hey, I'm kind of good
with the Hawaiian sling. That's a great feeling
 because now I realize, ""Man, I don't have
 to starve out here."" -Pass it off. Ah!
-(laughter) But then I started to realize,
okay, I had to make the fire. -AYSHA: Oh, there we go.
-TEENY: There we go. ROME:
 I had to clean the fish.
 I had to get the fish. So, like, at this point, how appreciative are you? And why should
I even give you some? GENEVIEVE:
 Rome has caught a few fish. They're, like, this big, like the kind
you would have as a pet, and... Rome decided to eat two of the four fish himself. -Can I put this whole thing
in my mouth?
-Yeah. AYSHA:
 We only got the smallest bite. I'm literally, like... You're trying to savor it
 as much as possible. Like, ""This is all I'm gonna get
from Rome. I know this is all
that he's willing to hand over."" Excuse you? You did absolutely
nothing to deserve this. Absolutely nothing. You aren't
even in my alliance, Aysha. Why should I give you
a big chunk of meat? So guess what I did. The last two fish,
I ate them right next to Aysha. Right next to her.
 And I made sure I was smacking a little bit, so she could hear it,
 so she could know, ""Listen,
 if you want some of this fish, you better
 put in some work, too."" (spits) -Huh?

""You just spit that on my back."" Mmm. ♪ ♪ ANIKA: You'll like it.

 to trust Andy, like, fully, but he's willing to give me
 his Shot in the Dark before the next Tribal. And that, to me,
is like, ""Holy crap. Okay."" I-- That would make me
feel so much better. I'm giving,

 I don't need
 his Shot in the Dark, but that absolutely built
more trust with me. And that's exactly

you're such a decent guy. -Thanks, Gabe.
-And I... I love the way
you're approaching this game. He's on the bottom right now, but if I could bring him
 into a position of stability, I don't think
 he would ever turn against us. I mean, shoot. I could probably
call on that guy to be my limousine driver
for the night after this game is over, and he'd fly out from Michigan
to Baltimore and do that for me. This is something that I would
like to stay between us. Yeah. You got one, you got two. Exactly. Yeah. KYLE:
 According to Gabe, Sue and Caroline
 will not vote for one another. And as long as you have them, you got two extra votes with
your vote everywhere you go. But that's cooked in my head.
 I don't like it because if he's trying to make
 relationships with me, he's gonna want me
 to flip on Tiyana. And there's no way in hell that
I'm gonna try to go after her unless I absolutely have to. So if I can get
 Sue and Caroline roped in, then there's a way that I can
 keep Tiyana around, and we'll be able
to have the numbers to go after Gabe successfully. KYLE:
Gabe's been kind of shady. He thinks that you and Caroline
are his goats. Hmm. -And he told you that?
-Yeah. -Hmm. -Kyle is at the bottom, and he's desperate
 to save his life, but I will never forget
 that Kyle wanted me out. So there's no way I could live
with myself giving him a pass. How do you feel about him
staying in the game? Well, I hate
that we're talking today, 'cause I wanted

be juiced, be all positive, not talking so much game."" I'm the type

voice in the back of my head that's like, ""Dude,
you just learned how to do this. ""Now you're doing this
in an ocean. ""You're doing this exhausted in a deep, deep ocean."" It-It's-it's scary. It becomes
very real, real quick. -The ocean is definitely not
a swimming pool.
-Exactly. All right, Lavo,
you have one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Cannot be Aysha.
Who's it gonna be? -Me.
-PROBST:
Genevieve gonna sit out. Now, I'm curious. I got to ask. Kishan, you admitted
swimming is not your strength, but you're gonna participate
in this one. Why? You got to believe in yourself. It's a mentality thing.
And if you don't believe in yourself
and you start doubting yourself in these moments,
it's gonna carry forward. That's why you apply
to be on Survivor right there. All right, Genevieve, take
a spot on the sit-out bench. Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it.
-Yes! Let's go! -SUE: Yes, I agree.
-CAROLINE: I agree. Sounds good. Like, I'm-I'm gonna... All right, fine. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? -Go!
-GENEVIEVE: Go, Lavo! Gonna be Kyle, Rome
and Andy in the water. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:
You got to climb to the top
of that tower and leap. TIYANA:
Yeah, watch yourself. Let's go! Go! -Nice!
-PROBST:
Kyle in the water for Tuku. -Look at Rome getting some air.
-SOL: Let's go, Rome! AYSHA:
Nice, Rome! PROBST:
Here comes Andy. -(whooping)
-SAM: Come on, Andy! PROBST:
Your next stop is that crate. You got to climb up
and over the crate. -SUE: Keep going, Kyle!
-PROBST: There goes Kyle
in the lead for Tuku,
Rome right on his tail. Kyle with a nice dive. Rome in the water. SUE:
Go, Kyle! -Kyle up quickly with the buoy.
-(whooping) Rome made it look easy. -SOL: Let's go Rome!
-KISHAN: Let's go, Rome! PROBST:
Andy underwater for Gata. He's struggling,
didn't get it on the first go. -SIERRA: Go, Andy!
-Now you've got
the balance beam. -SUE: Go, Kyle!
-If you drop,
you got to go back. -CAROLINE: Yes, Kyle!
-SUE: Go, Kyle! Kyle has the buoy for Tuku. -SOL: Go, Rome!
-Rome's across the balance beam. -SAM: Go, Andy!
-PROBST: Andy has the buoy
for Gata. Kyle, no issues
with this challenge at all. -You're good, Tuku! Go!
-Go, Tuku. You're now running in pairs. Andy on the balance beam. SIERRA:
Take your time. PROBST:
He falls, got to go back. -It's okay, Andy! You got this!
-PROBST: You're good, Lavo! Go. Go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Gabe and Sue.
There they go. TIYANA:
Yes! Andy's still working
on that beam for Gata. Run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run! SIERRA:
Yeah! PROBST:
Oh, and a big fall. Nope. Nope, you're no good. -Foot hit the water.
-(overlapping shouting) Come on, kid! For Lavo,
it is Kishan and Aysha. -GENEVIEVE: Come on, Kishan!
-ROME: You got this! -Ready? Okay.
-Ready. Ready. Go. (Genevieve whooping) Yeah, Kishan! -TIYANA: You got this, Sue!
-PROBST: Sue taking on -that balance beam.
-CAROLINE: Let's go! PROBST:
Sue is across. -Let's go, Sue!
-GENEVIEVE: Go, Kishan! You got it! You got it! PROBST:
Kishan jumps.
He's back in the ocean. PROBST: Taking on a challenge
that terrifies him. Said he was afraid of heights,
said he was afraid of water, but he's out here doing it! Crawl, crawl, crawl. PROBST:
Andy drops again. -Andy!
-Crawl! PROBST:
Gata in dead last. -ANIKA: Crawl!
-PROBST: Gabe's good. He's got the buoy. Tuku in the lead now. -Come on, Andy.
-PROBST: Andy just needs to keep his feet out
of the water. SIERRA:
You got it, Andy! Nice work! PROBST:
You're good, Andy. All right, guys, you got this. -You're good, Gata!
-Yeah! Dig deep! You're good, Tuku! Go! -Kishan taking his time.
-GENEVIEVE: Good job, Kishan! Undoing the knots,
trying to release that buoy. TEENY:
You got it, you got it. -Oh, no.
-PROBST: Kishan falls. Got to go back. It's gonna be Sam and Anika
for Gata. Ready? Let's go. Let's go! SUE:
You got it. Looking good. Yeah, baby. Let's go. Gata trying to catch Lavo now. Kishan and Aysha
have taken a long time on this part of the challenge. So much so that Gata,
after a disastrous run by Andy, is now back in it. We got a challenge. SOL:
There we go! There we go! PROBST:
Aysha has the buoy. Can she keep her feet out
of the water? -Good job.
-SOL: That-a girl, Aysha! PROBST:
Aysha's across. You're good. Anika's across. Here comes Sam. Nice work! PROBST:
Gata has now passed Lavo. SIERRA:
Yeah! It's now Lavo in last place. SUE:
Good job, TT! -Let's go!
-PROBST: Tiyana with the buoy. SUE:
You're rocking it, girl! -Here comes Lavo.
-ROME: Good job, Aysha. Go, Gata! It's gonna be
Rachel and Sierra now for Gata. You're good, Lavo! Go! (whooping) PROBST: Sol and Teeny
now for Lavo, the last pair. You're good, Tuku.
Start working on the puzzle. One, two, three. -SAM: Attagirl, Si.
-PROBST: Rachel and Sierra leap from the platform. (indistinct shouting) There goes Sol and Teeny
for Lavo. Whoo! You got this, -you got this.
-Let's go, guys. PROBST:
The faster you get back here,
the sooner you are working on that puzzle. It's a Survivor seahorse puzzle. -PROBST:
It's Tuku in the lead still.
-Let's go. PROBST:
Pieces got to stay on the table. Now you've got the beam and one final buoy. Rachel untying the buoy. She's got it free. Sol, nice job on the beam. -Making that look easy.
-Good job, Sol! PROBST:
Gata's across! You're good, Gata! SAM:
Come on, girls! -You got this, Teeny.
-(groans) PROBST:
No, Teeny's got to go back. Come on, you guys. Got to get everybody
up here first. -You got it.
-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Start working on the puzzle. -Let's go, girls.
-It's gonna be Anika and Rachel on the puzzle. It is Gabe and Caroline
on the puzzle for Tuku. GENEVIEVE:
Good job, Teeny. PROBST:
Teeny has the buoy for Lavo. It's all good. It's all good. Teeny back in. Got to go again. Come on, come on, come on! TIYANA:
It's all right, guys.
You got it. Got a lot of time. Here we go. Nice and methodical. PROBST:
Day seven, Survivor 47. Yes, yes, yes, yes,
Caroline, yes. -Let's go, Teeny. You got this.
-Teeny at that same spot. Teeny, you're good. Let's go. ROME:
There you go.
Let's go, guys! -GENEVIEVE: Good job!
-AYSHA: Right here, right here. ROME:
Let's go. Right here,
right here. I'll take the buoy. -I'll take the buoy.
-Looking for two tribes. Rachel with a piece for Gata. Gabe and Caroline
doing a nice job together. Rachel with another piece -for Gata.
-Beautiful. Gata's got some momentum
right now. Lavo would like to get
a little momentum, get in this. Does this go here? No. Caroline trying
to get another piece for Tuku. Will it fit? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it does.
That's another piece for Tuku. I got it, I got it, I got it. PROBST:
Rachel with another piece. Lavo now in trouble
and decidedly in last place. The only tribe that hasn't gone
to Tribal Council. It is Gata and Tuku
doing a great job on the puzzle. That's it. That's it. PROBST:
Lavo in dead last. The inevitable appears
to be coming. Yeah, that one right there. That one that-- That was it,
that was it, that was it. That was literally the piece. -I saw it.
-Yeah, this could be right. PROBST:
It is Gata, then Tuku. Yes. Yeah. -SAM: Yes. Yes.
-PROBST:
Gata with another piece. Gata down to three pieces now. This is in the deep freeze.
Lavo's going to Tribal Council. I'm gonna call it.
Genevieve can only watch. Rachel trying to get
that piece in. She's got it. Gata down to their last piece. For immunity and reward. -Gata has it.
-(screaming) Gata wins immunity and reward--
large tarp and two hammocks. It now just comes
to a nice finish for Tuku. SUE:
You got it, Gabe. There it is.
Tuku down to two now, as Tribal Council's inevitable
for Lavo. Tuku down to their last piece. (cheering) PROBST:
There it is. -Tuku wins immunity and reward.
-(cheering) Safe from Tribal Council, sending Lavo to Tribal Council
for the first time this season, where somebody
will be the third person voted out of Survivor 47. Ah! Come on! Gata, congratulations. Nobody going home from Gata.
No Tribal Council tonight. In addition, nice reward
waiting for you back at camp. Hot day like this,
that tarp will help a lot. Two hammocks will make things a little more comfortable. -Well done.
-Thank you. Tuku, nice job. (overlapping chatter) Yeah. PROBST: Nobody going home from
Tuku, no Tribal Council tonight. Smaller tarp waiting for you
back at camp. -Well done.
-Appreciate it. -In addition...
-(whooping) ...you also earned
your flint back. -Thank you.
-We'll take it. All right, swim out,
enjoy the night off. -Big jump?
-PROBST: Celebrate. -Go, guys.
-(laughing): Yay! (Kyle howls) All right, Lavo.
New part of the game, Rome. You have not had
to vote somebody out. Some fans would say you haven't
actually played Survivor until you've gone
to Tribal Council. What are you feeling right now? I mean, me personally,
I'm feeling a lot of nervousness. I mean,
I came back from the journey and told my tribe
exactly what happened. So they all know
that I don't have a vote. So, really, I have no say
in what happens tonight. So I'm just gonna be sitting
there like a bump on a log. So, who knows
how tonight's gonna go? All right, Lavo,
Tribal Council tonight, where somebody will be the third
person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing,
I'm gonna take your flint. Sorry for you, Genevieve. -(Genevieve sighs)
-You will have a chance
to earn it back at the next challenge. Swim out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. SOL:
 Apparently,
 Rome does not have a vote. Just from reading
 his body language, I think that guy's lying. I don't believe
what he's saying right now. But we just need
 to be prepared for everything because who knows
 what could happen tonight? Outwit, outplay, outlast. Think you have what it takes?

to volunteer to leave?
-(Kishan laughs) All right. Okay.
We got that out of the way. TEENY:
 This loss means that it's time for lines to be drawn, lines that I've been really,
really procrastinating having to show. My number one is Kishan. And I know that we're leaning more towards working
 with Rome and Genevieve. That means the decision is now who to vote out-- Sol or Aysha. I have to decide and try to hurt as little amount
of people as possible so that I can still keep
this position I'm in, which is pretty good. How are you feeling? -I mean, I feel so good
with you guys.
-Mm-hmm. I feel scared,
the same as I did about Rome. (sputters) AYSHA:
 Then how would you feel
 if it was Genevieve? TEENY:
 I think it's the safer option. AYSHA:
I would love more than anything to target Rome, but I cannot, because we have
this large suspicion that he has something that he found on this beach,
 because that man was looking like
 his life depended on it. And then there was a hard stop, and he just stopped looking. If we focus today
on getting out Genevieve, 'cause I just don't think
we can get Rome out. -I don't see us there.
-No, I don't. Neither do I. -We can't take that risk.
-Exactly. But I just want to let you know that, like,
if they start talking -and it seems like
it's gonna be one of you...
-Mm-hmm. -Okay. Okay.
-I do. -I really do.
-I appreciate that. I would not be comfortable
with you going home. With Aysha,
 I want her to feel like I'm good with her and that I'm
going with our original plan, that I'm working with her
and Sol and Kishan. Though, in small ways, I'm trying to give her little warnings that, ""Hey, ""just maybe this might not go
the way you want. ""And if it doesn't,
are you going to be down ""to work with me
and vote out Sol to preserve your own life
in this game?"" So, the plan is actually going
to be Aysha, -but we want Sol to play
his Shot in the Dark, so...
-Okay. -I hear you. I hear you.
-That's.... and... Yeah. You know, if I had to choose
one, I would choose Sol. ROME:
 Okay. What's your reasoning? Teeny started
 to break it down a little bit, and she made perfect sense,
because right now, for my game, the biggest threat is someone
else finding that next idol, because I have
to play mine tonight. You made such a good point. -'Cause I have
to play my idol tonight.
-You have to. Which means that there's gonna
be an idol back out here. Yes, absolutely. And you know
it's gonna be a mad dash. The second I get back to camp, I'm hitting the jungle
in the middle of the night. -Exactly.
-Like, I'm that type of person. And you know who else would? -Sol.
-Sol. I have wanted to vote out Sol since the start of this game. I cannot stand the dude
 at this point. So the fact that it ended up
turning from Aysha over to Sol, that just made me smile
ear to ear. I'd be willing to write
Sol's name down lickety-split. I cannot wait
to do that tonight. So as long as we can get him to not play
 his Shot in the Dark, then the plan is foolproof. -But...
-Oh, do you? -Yeah.
-'Cause I have no ... clue. -Yeah, well...
-So... I'm, at this point,
99% sure it's gonna be Aysha. -99? Bro.
-Mm. -Yeah.
-99% is a done deal, and we've been here
for 30 minutes. I mean, it wasn't really a lot
of conversations... -Really?
-...to have. Yeah. Like... -Ah...
-They-they feel like
they want to keep you around -because you're strong.
-Thank God. And you do carry us through
a lot of these challenges -and different parts of it.
-All right, man. And I don't have a vote,
so I literally don't have a say. So all I'm doing
is getting information -from other people, you know?
-Yeah. ROME:
 Being in character
 and playing it like I don't have a vote, it comes natural, man. I can lie in Survivor all day long. I'm sorry, Mom. I know
you're gonna be disappointed watching this right now, but I'm lying
 for my life in the game. I'm playing hard, man. If Boston Rob was the godfather, there's got to be
a godson somewhere, right? SOL:
 Is there any chance that you're coming up to me, saying, ""Hey, Aysha's the name""? I mean, why... why would I...? To make me feel good, and then it's like,
""Hey, y'all, it's-it's Sol."" It's a... it's a... it's a question that... -I mean, I don't know...
-It's a potential, right? It's a potential? I guess, but, like, I just don't
see the point in me doing that. -Yeah.
-'Cause I don't have a vote. So, like, I'm trying
to stay good with everybody. -Right, right, right.
All right, cool.
-Just in case, like... -You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, that would only hurt me
if I was like... That's right. That's right.
That's right. That's right. I-I get what you're saying,
but, yeah, that just doesn't... Yeah. No. Like, I...
Tonight I can't. I just got to be honest
with everybody and stay mellow. That's-that's my best game plan,
like I said. That's all I could do, so... SOL:
 Rome is talking to me
 like I'm an idiot. ""Sol, I don't have a vote, ""so I'm not gonna get voted out. ""Just so you know, everyone is gonna vote Aysha out."" I don't know if Rome
 is just completely clueless... If I was you,
I'd just draw the continent. Asia. Like...
(laughing) Yeah. That would be
very cool of me. ...or if Rome is one of the best Survivor players ever. ROME:
 Me and Sol just talked, and -I told Sol that
the plan is gonna be Aysha.
-KISHAN: Mm-hmm. ""And if you want to be
on the right side of the vote, you should just vote Aysha.""
And he was like, ""It sucks, but I want
to stay in the game, so..."" There was no inkling
he was scared -about maybe using
the Shot in the Dark?
-I made him feel really good about it, so... Is there any world where
we bring in Aysha on this four? -Yes.
-TEENY: Yeah. KISHAN:
 Aysha's genuinely someone I would love to work with
in the future because
she is such a strategist. This is also a bit
 of a selfish move of looping Aysha into the plan
 because I want it to be that Teeny and I tell her, so
that, going forward, she knows, ""We saved your butt 'cause your name was gonna be
the vote today."" Okay. So he does for sure? -TEENY: He's not telling us.
-Right. TEENY:
There's only one guaranteed, I feel, safe situation to do, and it is vote Sol. AYSHA:
 The fact that they trusted me with that information about
Rome's idol means the world. But I don't want Sol to go home. I think the worst thing
 in the world that we could do is keep Genevieve
and Rome together. KISHAN:
 Yeah, but, hey... KISHAN:
 Aysha is not budging from wanting
 to vote out Genevieve. And, you know, that's definitely
very concerning, 'cause if Aysha keeps discounting
 any potential other options, that's really hard
to work with going forward. She was not... -KISHAN: She was not budging.
-...hearing us. TEENY:
 I feel a very close personal connection with Aysha, and I know we're both rooting
 for each other in this game
 and want to work together, but she's kind of digging
 her own grave at this point. TEENY:
 So tonight the question is, if Aysha won't work with me and vote out Sol, is it worth
 keeping her in this game? But, yeah,
 somebody's gonna be upset. Somebody's going to be betrayed. But I have to make the decision
 that's going to guarantee me
 to go further in this game. Th is i sn ' t Ch ar mi n! No wonder I don't feel

for this group. -Rome, every first...
-(Rome laughs) -Why are you laughing?
-I just was, like, hoping
that you didn't pick me first, but it's okay.
Let's do this, man. We here. PROBST:
Is there a curse about getting -the first question?
-TEENY: No. -That's just Rome.
-ROME: I got a superstition about sitting
in the front middle, and I'm sitting
in the front middle. So, I mean, I already got
a lot of nerves already. -Yeah. We're already 0 for 2.
-ROME: Yeah, exactly, exactly. -Not looking good.
-Yeah. No, sir. Let's do something different.
Let's go to Genevieve. -(Rome sputters)
-Genevieve.
-Thanks, Rome. What I was gonna ask was,
coming into tonight, what do you think this tribe
hopes to be with tonight's vote? GENEVIEVE:
I think everyone
today was a little emotional because tonight's
killing someone's dream, and so the hope is that the five
who go back are still cohesive. So, Sol, do you get the feeling that tonight's vote is based on trying
to make the tribe stronger, or this is about alliances and
I got to make sure I'm in one? I thought
it was about alliances. I felt really good
with who I was paired with, but I got a very uneasy feeling
in my stomach, and so... So, as we sit here right now,
you're feeling that uncertainty? Yeah, it's, uh,
it's not a good feeling that I'm feeling right now. Can you overthink it, Rome? You can definitely overthink it. Once you get paranoid
and, you know, you start talking with people, and
you might say the wrong thing, and that might make them think,
""Oh, man, this person's
not really trusting me."" Even though
they weren't gonna be the vote, now they will be the vote
just because they're getting
a little bit too paranoid. PROBST:
Aysha, do you feel the same way?
That it can literally change like that?
Everything was fine, then somebody says the wrong
thing and everything shifts? Yeah, it can change
at the drop of a hat. Like, you could have
a conversation with a person, and an hour later
they're not being as reassuring. It's like, ""Oh, okay,
maybe that may not be the plan. ""Maybe that was just something
in the moment just to tell me. Maybe I should be worried."" PROBST:
Kishan, the dangerous part of somebody feeling
on the outside is something as simple
as the Shot in the Dark or some other advantage
or idol in the game. Did you sense that there's someone
feeling on the outs today? I did not sense that, and
that's probably a misperception on my end, because, for me,
I'm strong to the core four. And you know, I want to go ahead and move forward
with whatever we believe in. -So...
-PROBST: Who's the core four? -I'm not gonna say.
-But there is four? -Maybe.
-PROBST: Teeny? TEENY:
I mean,
when he says ""core four,"" you have no choice
but to believe him. It's interesting because people who aren't involved in the plan
have to know something. So you have to be talking
to everybody. And if that means that you feel
like you trust somebody enough to where you're locked in
with them, and you don't need to reassure
them as much, then there you go. Sol, that sounds like a message. If you're part of the core four,
the core four is saying, ""Dude, come on,
we're good. Relax."" SOL:
Yeah,
that's what it sounds like, um, but this is Survivor, and I'm trying to find out, is this, like, part of the game
where I'm going crazy, or is it, they're just having, like,
real conversations with people? You know what I'm saying?
And I hope I'm not going crazy. PROBST:
Kishan,
it's a fine line because, as Aysha was saying, you want to make sure
you're solid, but if you dip into the well
one more time, you might say the wrong thing. Do you worry about that as well? KISHAN:
Yes. It's so easy
to get tripped up. And that did complicate things, which is, I think,
what's causing this uneasiness,
because now we're just like, ""Holy cow. How many
other different conversations ""were happening that ""I wasn't a part of or
someone else wasn't a part of? ""Maybe if we just took
a step back ""and kind of kept it
a bit more calm, maybe those feelings
wouldn't arise."" Today felt like you're in
this trio of best friends. Like, you have a group chat.
You talk every day, right? Three people.
But then you're just walking. You know,
you're walking your dogs, and you look in a restaurant, and the other two
are having lunch. And you're like,
""Wait. They didn't put that ""in the group chat.
Like, what's going on? ""Like, I'm so confused. Do I go up?""
Because I'm a part of this. Like, I should feel welcome
to come up. Genevieve, Aysha's example
is straight out of real life. Sometimes
it's a misunderstanding. Sometimes there's more to it. Is that a relatable experience
for you out here? Yeah. You don't know

what's your take on this? All that cohesion

but it's honestly just a facade. And we pushed it off as long
as we could until we needed to. And at the end of the day,
we knew that one person's name
will be written down, and they will be voted off. And that's a harsh reality
that we all knew when we came in today. All right, we feel good to vote,
or do we need to talk more? I just want
to say one more thing. I don't want
to call anybody out, but I hope the person
that agreed to vote with me sticks to that. Otherwise, I know that I could

 to keep him around. Q kind of blew up his own game and has been causing chaos
 at camp. Tonight, I'm betting I can keep my idol
in my pocket because Q is going home. -...it's gonna be
really, really bad.
-Right, but... Kenzie is having cold feet,
 but at some point, you've got to make a move. We can take Tiff out tonight. Maybe we don't tell Kenzie. If I keep waiting

Final seven. -Final seven.
-Holy crap. Wow. This Tribal was the first time
I've been left out of a vote. And it's the worst. It's the worst feeling ever,
because I'm like, ""What did I do
to not, like, be... in the club?"" Like, who...
Did I... Like, why am I not trustworthy? Like, I'm so confused. And I'm mad because this was my idea
 to blindside Tiff, and now somebody else
 is getting the credit. Like, I'm mad at myself
for not seizing the opportunity. Ugh.
I just feel so dumb. I feel so dumb. I was having this whimsical,
 amazing time. I just let the game
 get away from me. I got blindsided, too, you know? I don't know if you want a hug

-Yeah. -Do you know what I mean?
-Was it Maria? -Yeah.
-Yeah. I knew it. CHARLIE: There's always
 fallout after Tribal, but this vote
 was different because everybody who returned
to camp voted for Tiff except Venus and Kenzie. And the way
 they were left out left them really feeling bitter. So, my thinking was,
 talk to Kenzie because this game is
 all about working with people, adapting to what's
in front of you and keeping your options open. -It's a great move. It's-it's...
-I know. -It's my move!
-I know. -That's why I'm so mad.
-I know. Right now, we just have to,
like, bide our time, you know? There's no time.
There's six days left. -Well, it's, like...
-And I just, like... Just, like, find
the right moment, you know? I have to find that idol,
is what I need to do. This is the first time
I've been wrong in the game, but maybe
 this is what I needed to get my head back on straight
 and realize I came out here
 to play and to win. I'm just gonna have
to get a little bit more crafty, pay a lot more attention. I can turn this around. -Final seven together, huh?
(laughs)
-Yes. -We're gonna rock out, Ben.
-Oh, we're rocking out already. We're gonna have a good time. We can have our final five
right here. MARIA:
Yeah, it'd be a good final five. This Tribal couldn't have gone any better. Oh, my God. (laughs) This vote was my idea, and I was able
 to get this group together-- Q, Liz, Ben, me and Charlie-- and just pull off
 an epic blindside. And it was just, like, the sweetest feast
I've ever had. (laughs) This has lit such a fire in me. I do see the end, and I'm like,
 ""Is it possible that maybe
 we are the final five?"" I could do this again.
Let's do it again. (laughs) The blindside-- even though
we were on the wrong side of it, was a blessing in disguise. -Yeah.
-We got rid of big competition -and Maria put a huge target
on her back.
-Yeah. Let Maria think
this is her move. Don't give off the fact
that you're upset, and realistically, it's gonna
come and bite her in the ass. Maria's played
a very low-key game where everyone can tell
she's a potential threat, but this is the first time she really
let her freak flag fly, and she's announcing
to the world, like, ""Hey, this is my move and I'm here to play."" And it's scary
because Maria has a strong three with her, Charlie and Ben. Siga three needs
to be broken up. Yeah. But tomorrow's a new day,

I guess that means it's time
to start looking, right? KENZIE:
Yeah. (mouthing) Q: With Tiff idol leaving
 in her pocket, we're thinking it's gonna
come back to play at some point. We don't know if there's
 something out there just yet, but the only way
 to find it is to look for it. I know. Okay. CHARLIE: Idol fever has struck Nuinui beach. MARIA: Yeah. CHARLIE:
 It was sort of
 a domino effect this morning. Q started looking,
 then I started looking, then Ben started looking,
 then Venus started looking, then Kenzie started looking,
 then Maria started looking. And everybody's looking for... (imitates drumroll) ...Tiffany's idol! ♪ ♪ CHARLIE:
 An idol at this point
of the game changes everything. So, as much as I don't
 want to look for an idol because I'm exhausted
 and starving and want to save my energy, it's a necessity at this point. VENUS: At last Tribal, for the
 first time ever in this game, I was on the wrong side
of the vote. So, I need to flip the script. I need to find this idol
 and I need to find it quick. Q:
 I've looked from the front to
the back to the top to the side. Oh, man. I'm exhausted. VENUS:
 I've gone through probably some
 of the toughest times that I've ever had
 in my life here. But today, the thing that calms me down is A: I know this island
better than anyone, B: I know
where Randen found his, and C:
I know where Tiffany found hers. So I have something
to work off of, of where to look
and where not to look. And I'm like, ""You know what?
 People are going hard. Let's go through literally
 every single corner."" And I take my little stick,
 and I'm pushing leaves, and I'm pushing leaves. And... I found it.
 I found it first! And I was so ecstatic. I immediately started
 to walk away so that I could go find
 a corner to read it. But then I realized,
 like, ""Hey, that is not the move right now."" So I U-turn it, and
everyone's still up and looking. So, I bide my time. And it's so hard. MARIA: Yeah. As someone
who's been looking for 20 days, it's so hard to hide the joy
and excitement that is building up in my heart. Where's Liz? (snoring) I'm gonna go around the bend

 of the vote sucked, but I have definitely, like, thought about it, and I was
just... I got too comfy cozy. I wasn't on my p's and q's. I wasn't paying attention. Trying to balance
 your own individual game with a group of individuals that all have
 their own individual games... Everyone's lying. You never know
 who's telling the truth. You don't know
who's working with who. Ugh. Even though it feels like
we're on the bottom, we're in the perfect position of being in the middle
of this... this war. KENZIE:
Right now, like, the only person that hasn't lied to me
 is freakin' Venus, which is hilarious, but, like, really, she's the only one
who hasn't lied to me. I'm so curious
as to what her next move is because she's not
really hiding it. KENZIE:
 I like Venus now.
 I like her as a person. I never
 in a million years thought we would be
 working together, but here we are, me and my messy,
sweet little friend. I don't see it. (Venus laughs) KENZIE:
 Venus is just, like,
 looking at trees, and is like, ""It's not here.""
 And I'm like, ""You have to move some leaves,
honeybun. Like, what are you doing?"" It's not looking good. KENZIE:
 Venus' technique
 for idol-searching, I think, is to follow around people
 that are idol-searching and wait for them to find it.
(laughs) Girlfriend is not
 really looking hard. She's, like, kind of does this
with a stick, and she's like, ""No."" And meanwhile, I'm, like, digging holes, and she's like... Any luck? (laughing):
I'm like, ""Venus, what?
What are you doing?"" I doubt it. KENZIE:
 Who knows? Maybe she has it, and she's bamboozling us all. But... I think
she's just waiting for someone
that's close to her to find it so she can have the tea. VENUS:
 It is so relieving to know that even though people are
 still scattering about, looking for an idol, I don't have to worry
about going out and, like,
solving a riddle, or, like, going and finding a second part
to this idol. I have it. But no one will
 ever catch a whiff of me having this because I don't see any benefit in-in someone knowing
that I have this power. Oh, my God. I know.
I cannot believe it. VENUS:
So it's very much a timing game. Like, when is the right time
 to play this? No, she shouldn't. -People were just
really good at lying.
-Yeah. So, it's stressful,
but it's so comforting. It's, like,
the sweet, sweet comfort. Like, I want to... Mwah. I love you. It's, like,
I think this is my best friend on this island right now. Hello. What's going on? Okay. -We have lots to go through.
-Yeah. First of all, congratulations. Thank you.
I'm happy to have had my moment. -We have not... even talked.
-That was, like, amazing. -That was amazing.
-Yes. I'm so glad
to have been a part of it. -I'm really proud of you.
-Thank you. -That was... that was...
-It was scary as hell. -That's big stuff
that you pulled off last night.
-Yeah. -That was big stuff.
-I know
what the repercussions are, -but, like...
-Yeah. Thank you
for doing that with me. Oh, my God. Of course, you know? Maria wanted the Tiff vote
to be something that she drove, she controlled, 100%, because the more
 you can clearly claim that a move was your own, the easier it is
 to sell and to pitch to a jury
that's looking for a player who had real influence
in the game. And that's where
Maria's head is at. But it's also
 a very double-edged sword, because Maria getting all the
 credit from the Tiff blindside has made her
a huge, huge target. I mean, people would be silly
if they didn't see that, like, you and I
have been working together. You're a threat. We voted cor...
voted correctly every time. -Every single time.
-Taken out three people. -You're a threat, I'm a threat.
-Yeah. -I did want to talk
to you about Q.
-Okay. What are you...
Where's your head at on him? I think we can use Q
for one more vote, -because Q trusts me,
and I trust Q.
-Yeah. -I don't know how that happened.
-Yeah. Like, I do think
he would vote with us -for one more time.
-Yeah. I've been playing this game
 with Maria since day one, and we have been lockstep. We've been talking about going
 to the final three together. But Q is,
 as far as I can tell, in Maria's pocket,
and I want him out of the game. So this move and the buildup to this move
is really where... I have seen my thinking and my route to the end maybe start to diverge
from Maria's. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Luckily, people have realized
 Maria is a huge threat. Nobody likes Q, so he's kind of
on the outs as well. So the two big threats--
 Q and Maria-- have made themselves
 very well-known. They are peacocking, for sure. Like, everyone can see that
their tail feathers are out, and that the attention's
on them. Maria-- she got to go. I thought she was just... a sleeper. -But Charlie, yesterday,
came to me, he was like...
-Yeah. ""That was a game-winning move,
and it wasn't mine."" -And I was like...
-Okay. ""Well, there's hope."" I mean, I want Q out, but... Maria is obviously
running things. -Yeah.
-What do you think? Oh, I think it makes sense. -If we can pull it off,
then Maria's got to go.
-Okay. KENZIE:
 There's seven of us left,
 and we need four. So the best thing for me is to
figure out who I can work with to get Maria and Q out of here, and then at the final five,
we can battle it out from there. Kenzie, have you
checked the beach? I'm gonna be honest. If Q doesn't get up and look
for it again, I'm gonna assume -he has it.
-Okay. And Maria's been gone alone
for a long time. LIZ:
That's what we're talking about. -Yeah, that's what
we've been talking about.
-VENUS: Okay. And she will think again
next time before leaving us out of a vote. It's not about that.
It's about... -she's the kingpin.
-She's... She's the kingpin, she... She's got the best story,
the best moves. Yeah. No, she's got to go. VENUS:
We will have the majority. A hundred percent. I am certain one
 of the Siga three may be open to potentially working with us,
 especially with Charlie. I've questioned
 how strategic he is, how cutthroat he can be,
but it seems like he's seeing that writing on the wall
 and realizes that he can't go to the end
 with Maria no matter what. And eventually, he's gonna
have to cut that cord, and I hope he sees
 that now's the time, while everyone's still on board. KENZIE:
Okay, so what are you thinking? CHARLIE:
I think Q is in Maria's pocket. Oh, 1,000%, he is. -Yeah?
-It's not even a pocket anymore. It's like she has, like, a...
a full bank vault that Q is stuck inside. KENZIE:
Yeah. CHARLIE:
I was not...
I was not cruise director... -Yeah.
-last night, you know? -KENZIE: Ugh.
-So...
-VENUS: That's so funny. CHARLIE:
 In the buildup
 to the Tiff vote, I wanted Maria
 to have sole credit because I need someone that I can sell as
the biggest target in the game. If that can overshadow
 any attention on me for the moment, that's probably what's best
for my game right now. At this point in the game, -there's seven people.
-Mm-hmm. And that has somehow
become the strongest pair. The whole stuff with Q
and that whole vote was a big... -I think, a big wake-up call
for probably everyone.
-Yeah. Charlie and Maria
 are super close. They're in the Siga alliance. But Charlie has no real
 résumé moves, and he knows it. He has been Maria's, like, jester
for this whole game. And he's-he's a smart kid,
he knows that. So I think Charlie's ready to make a move on Maria. So, who would you rather
go first? Too early to say or... I think too early to say, but... We'll just see whoever wins
and go from there. I'm just saying.
Yeah, 'cause, like, I feel like anyone could win. I've been building trust and relationships with Kenzie and Venus so that I could,
 if I wanted to, make a move
against Maria and Q at any point. I think we... we all know
what needs to be done, or else we're all screwed. VENUS: They will win. -Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. So they are, like, public enemy number one and two right now. CHARLIE:
 At some point,
 I have to ask myself, ""Is going to the final three
 with Maria handing Maria
 a million dollars?"" You have to start
thinking about your own game. And I'm feeling... my gut start to go
in two directions. One way is gonna win, and it might be
 making a move against Maria. ♪ ♪ Help your family

like he just figured it out. You're good, Ben.
That's how you do it! -Let's go!
-PROBST: Ben's now in it. There's Maria working
on her second and final ball. She landed her first.
Nobody else has. Venus doing a nice job,
down in green. She just made up a lot of time. Getting closer and closer
to that first target. Charlie making a move
for that first target. He'd like to be in this. Aw, damn. PROBST:
Maria drops.
Maria has to go back. The door is open for somebody
to drop that first ball. Venus has her first ball. Venus is now in it.
Look at that. LIZ:
Good job, V. PROBST:
Charlie drops his first.
Charlie's in it now. It is now Maria with one, Charlie with one,
Venus with one. Q getting closer
to that first target. Q drops his first ball!
Q's in it now. Liz drops her first ball.
She's in it. There's Kenzie. Can she drop? -(whoops) Here we go.
-Kenzie drops. She's in it. (laughs) -I got it in.
-Ben drops his first.
-KENZIE: Yay! -Ben's in it now.
-KENZIE: You're in it. PROBST:
Everybody now working
on their second ball. This is a challenge
that is as wide open as it gets. Maria very close to the end. Venus just behind. Right now,
it's Maria and Venus. Maria-- can she do it? -No. Maria drops
-Oh! six inches from the end.
Got to start again. Venus getting closer. -No!
-PROBST: Venus drops. We are wide open again! We got a challenge. -There's another one.
-Any one of the seven can win. Question is who will it be? Who's gonna be wearing
that necklace tonight? 'Cause you're earning it
right now. Aah! -(groans)
-Aah! Oh, my God. (groans) PROBST:
Venus, again,
with a shot to win it. -No. No! Aah!
-PROBST: No. This time, Venus drops again. So does Maria. And it's now Q in the lead. -Come on!
-PROBST: Q drops! Open again. Look at that-- day 21,
everybody with a shot at it. Oh. PROBST:
Who's gonna grab it? Who wants that necklace? Me. PROBST:
Venus in that same section,
last bit of track. Maria right on her tail. But it is Venus
in the lead right now. Is this the round? Is this where somebody
closes it out, claims their victory
for this challenge, guarantees themself
a spot at six? Slightest wrong move, and that ball falls. Venus inching closer. Maria catching her. Venus-- can she do it? For the win, individual immunity, just has to drop it in that net. -No! No!
-PROBST: And she doesn't!
-LIZ: Wow. -She couldn't get it
in the target.
-What?! -PROBST: Wow!
-So close.
-LIZ: V! -No!
-PROBST: Maria at the same spot
Venus was. Can she drop it for the win? -Aah!
-And she does!
Maria pulls it out. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Her second individual
immunity win, guaranteed a spot at six and pizza delivered to camp -on day 21. Wow.
-LIZ: Good job, sister. -Maria!
-PROBST: Nice job, everybody. -BEN: Congrats, Maria.
-LIZ: Nice job, sister. (Ben whoops) Maria, come on over. (whooping)
Way to go, Mama. -Well done.
-BEN: Yeah! For the second time this season,
safe tonight at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot
in the final six. -(whooping)
-PROBST: You're going
to have a fun afternoon with pizza
being delivered for you. Choose one person to join you. Walk me through the thought
process of strategy, compassion. You're also fueling
your competition. -There's a lot going on.
-There's a lot going on. I mean, Liz has been
eating some rice. She's been sharing with Venus. Ben's been falling apart. He's completely depleted. Q took me
on the reward last time, and so I feel
like I need to take him. And so there's, you know...
Charlie didn't go on the reward. It's a really hard decision.
How many people do I get? We'll find out.
Right now, you got one. Okay. I think I'm gonna pick Ben. PROBST:
Come on over, Ben. CHARLIE:
You go get it, buddy. (sniffles) (sniffles) (crying) This is crazy. PROBST:
All right,
there are five people left. You're gonna bring
one more person with you. Which means three of you
will have pizza, four will not. Walk me through
who you're gonna choose. Um, for me, it's more,
like, my mindset is more like who is physically falling apart
right now, and it's not about competition or who I want
to work with or whatever. It's just whose body is failing. I'll take myself
out of it, Maria. I think there are people here
that need the food more than me. All right, Venus,
Liz and Q, make your case. Um, I've lost weight. I would like to eat,
but it's your decision. I want you to pick
whoever you want, you know? I mean, I still
haven't pooped in three weeks, so I'd like
something to get moving. You know, I ain't too proud
to beg. (laughs) Love that song. I think whatever decision
you make is completely fine, Maria. You shouldn't-you shouldn't
feel guilty, either way. ♪ ♪ I've never seen
a moment like this, ever. -46 seasons.
It has never taken this long.
-(laughs) PROBST:
Nobody's given this much
thought. That's not a criticism. That's just an observation. Okay. Liz and Q, rock paper scissors. Pick rock. (laughs) Paper covers rock. Is that it? -Yep.
-Q, come on over.

Maria, Ben and Q, you're gonna have
an afternoon with pizza. The other four, got nothing for
you. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. KENZIE:
 I am shocked. Maria is like, ""Liz and Q,
play rock paper scissors."" What? Liz has made it
 very abundantly clear that she's starving. If you just want to take Q because he's your number one,

""I'm sorry. I'm not gonna beg. You know, physically,

Uh, when she said,
""Rock paper scissors,"" I was like, ""Oh,
it's gonna be Liz and Venus."" -Me, too.
-And I was like, ""Liz and who?"" I knew it was gonna be Q. KENZIE:
I cannot believe she said,
""I'm just trying to judge it
on whose body's breaking down."" -I know. And then...
-Can I just say, I would have respected her
so much more if she just picked who she picked, but
the fact that she prefaced it -by saying that and
then picked the most well-fed,

feast, like a day ago.
-VENUS: Yeah. Literally. He hasn't even digested it yet.
It's still in his stomach. CHARLIE: The pizza picking was a bit of a... for lack of a better word,
a ... show. I thought, for sure,
 Maria was gonna choose Venus or Liz, but Q ends up going. And let me tell you,
 the four pizza losers were pissed. -KENZIE: What the ...
-VENUS: She went from being a hero to a villain real quick. To emphasize being this,
like, mother to all, caring about everyone. I'm so done, like, being quiet
when someone ticks me off. So, what are we
doing tonight-- Q? He's evil and self-centered
and selfish. -My God.
-I know it's a game,
but, like, geez. The veil has been lifted. I had a feeling Maria and Q
 were working together, but now it's just blatantly
freaking obvious, and I cannot respect anybody who is playing the game
 with that jerk. -I mean, did you know
they were so close?
-CHARLIE: I... As far as I'm concerned,
Q's Maria's number one. -That's...
-Q's an idiot. -(groans)
-It's the classic Survivor ""If you can't
go for your target, go for their number one."" I was just piling everything on. ""Maria's the worst. ""They're such a tight duo. I can't believe
she's working with him."" But since Maria has the necklace
 tonight, the pizza losers want to vote out Q. Which is great,
 because Q is someone that I want out of the game,
 and I want him out soon. Okay, so, we don't think
Q has an idol? -Definitely not.
-CHARLIE: Uh... I am 97% sure. Charlie, thanks
for listening to me vent. -Oh.
-I know you and Maria are close. -I'm in my feelings right now.
-We are, -but, I mean...
-VENUS: That's different.
That's game versus... Things have been turning
a different corner, you know? BEN: Damn right. -I slowed down.
-I just want to say
thank you so much. You're so welcome, Ben. If a look could kill... ...I got slaughtered today. (Ben chuckles) MARIA:
 Liz pierced me with her eyes. BEN:
 Mm-hmm. MARIA: I was gonna
be damned either way. Yeah. Yo, Liz does have rice. MARIA:
That's what I'm saying. That's why I was like,
well, what's, you know? -Yeah.
-Kenzie just ate. Charlie's like, ""Don't take me."" -Yeah.
-So I'm like,
""Well, that's the right move."" -Q: Mm-hmm.
-BEN: A hundred percent. MARIA:
 I'm sure I pissed people off, but winning this challenge
 gives me peace of mind. It means that I am safe tonight, and that gives me
 a lot of power. At this point, there
 are still three Siga members. So with seven people left-- although it's
a very unpopular opinion-- I got to keep Q happy right now. Q is a number for me. He trusts me, and I trust him. They know you two are tight. -It's a little obvious
at this point.
-Yeah. And they know
you and Charlie are day-ones. MARIA:
The three of us. Exactly. -That's all we need.
-That's all we need. Really. Yeah. -Q: Is that ham?
-Yeah. -I think it's ham.
-It's ham. Q:

about 23 slices of pizza. (laughs) It ain't fair. But I don't feel guilty
 at all, because I get to now make sure
that I'm not going home tonight. I say Siga three, plus me, -take out Venus first, because
-MARIA: Yeah. Yeah. Liz is less likely
to win immunity than Venus. -BEN: Yeah.
-MARIA: Right, right. -Yeah.
-Venus came super close today. -I know. I thought she had it.
-But... MARIA:
I say it's time to get her out. Q:
 Venus is the real problem with all the complaining, and the pushy and the running and telling
this story to this person. And, also, she has the greatest
 shot at winning immunity, as we saw in this challenge. She is a problem. So she needs to go. The negative vibes
have been a bit much. MARIA:
Yeah. Any chance Venus found the idol? No. MARIA:
It's time to get her out. I'm ready. Yeah. Ug h, w he n is m y al le rg y sp ra y go in g to k ic k in ? -You need Astepro.

 come back to camp, and we do our classic niceties. ""How much did you eat?
 Was it delicious? Oh, tell us all about it.
 I'm so glad."" Even though, seconds before they arrived, man, I thought that the people
at camp were gonna eat them. It was tense. I'm happy with Maria's
 choices for me, but it really put the heat
on her and Q. I know they probably been
pitching me this whole time. -Yep.
-Just got to let them know -that's not happening, so
they don't write my name down.
-Okay. Yep. -In case V pulls out
an idol, but...
-Okay. the real plan is Venus. Okay. Okay. At this point in the game, I want the burners turned up
 on everyone but me. So if I can hide this vote
when I don't have the necklace, and all of a sudden, everyone's
eyes are on Q and Maria, this is great. I mean, I did. I just... I feel really bad, and I'm not really sure
how to talk about it. Honestly, Maria,
it was really weird. -We were all like, ""Wow.""
-MARIA: I know. There's no way
to win that situation. And I told myself,
""I never want to win reward because I don't want
to have to make that choice."" And I knew I was gonna
piss people off and I just, I apologize
if I hurt anybody's feelings. There was just, there was no way to make
everyone happy in that choice. Oh, I completely
agree with that. I just can't stand Q,
and I just don't know why you would
want to make him happy. 'Cause he's
such an ass to everyone. He does nothing around camp. He used all the firewood in,
like, two hours. I'm done not expressing myself. MARIA:
Okay. Yeah, go for it. LIZ:
That is my mindset, Maria. I guess that's what
I've learned in Survivor, is, like,
I've spent my whole life just letting myself be angry
and not speaking what I'm really feeling for the sake
of someone else's feelings. And I think, honestly--
this sounds crazy-- I think that's why
I have so many ... allergies, because
I've suppressed my own self for so long that my body
started attacking things. So I've said my piece. I feel better.
Thank you for hearing me. Normally, I'm not someone
 who holds grudges, but with Q, it just feels
a little more personal. For some reason,
 he just keeps surviving. And I'm getting more and more and more and more
and more and more irritated. MARIA:
 I felt like I hurt you,
and I didn't like how that felt. I was just shocked about Q,
because I'm like, ""He's a jerk."" -So...
-The thing is, Liz,
is that, like, the only people
that are talking to me are Siga people and Q. That's it. -You know?
-I feel like the only person
talking to me is Venus. And I don't believe
anything she says. She's so all over the place. MARIA:
Well, that's another reason
why I can't work with her. I can't understand
her game at all. Ditto. And so I guess
that's why I come to you, because it's like... I liked working with you
for Tevin. I liked working with you
for Tiff. I like the fact that you said, ""I'm here to play the game.
I want to play the game."" But, like, let's play the game. Right now,
 having not had a chance to talk to everybody,
it seems like the ladies want Q out, and Q, Ben and I have
discussed getting Venus out. And so, Venus and Q are
 gonna be the targets tonight. It's my hope
 that Venus goes home, but, you know, you never know. Like, as the sun starts
 to go down, sometimes things change and people scramble,
 and then a new plan comes out. In my mind, the people
I'm working with are solid, but I guess that's
a silly assumption. ♪ ♪ Yeah, I know. I'm, like... -I know. I know.
-Okay. Are you and Ben doing Q? I don't know about Ben. KENZIE:
 Well, Ben can do
 whatever Ben wants, but, like, -if you're gonna write Q,
we're good.
-Yeah. It doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. If an idol comes into play
at six, and Q gets it and Maria wins immunity,
then we're screwed. -Yeah.
-Like, we'd be so dumb
to not get rid of him -right now.
-Yeah, I know. -We've got to do Q.
-I know. I don't think Q's a bad person. I don't think Q's evil, but... I'm fine with
other people thinking that, because, ultimately,
 down the line, I want a final four that doesn't
have Q or Maria in it. What is your ideal final four? -Final four?
-Yeah. 'Cause, frankly,
we got to think about it. I've been thinking about that. 'Cause a four at six
controls the vote. VENUS:
 Charlie's in a power position. He's kingpin right now. And based off of discussions from today
and previous to today, just based off
of my relationship with Charlie as a whole, I think that
 Charlie really understands trust goes both ways. And if he sticks to the Q vote tonight, I'm gonna give him
something in return next time. Can I tell you,
I've got your back. -And I've got...
-I've got yours, too. I've got
some things up my sleeve. -I feel like we'll be fine.
-What does that mean? You don't have
to worry about it now, -but I feel like in terms of...
-I am worried about it. No, you don't
have to worry about it. I'm saying us,
final four, is locked in. For tonight's vote, sure, I have an easy out.
I can just play my idol. ""Oh, there's a risk of me
going home. I can play it."" But that's not what
 wins the game for you. It's about using it correctly
 or not using it at all because your social game
 is that good. And so, even though
I have a guaranteed way of going into
tonight's Tribal stress-free, I don't even care. I don't want to use it because, for me, if I get this correct and I get to save the idol
 for another vote, then that just
speaks to more of why I deserve to win this game
in the end. We'll make it to final four. No. Okay. That's why I was... That seemed like
things up your sleeve. Or maybe I do. (gasps) -Who knows? No, I don't. But...
-Oh, Venus. We-we will be close
after this vote. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay?
-Yeah. Venus alluded to someone-- maybe her-- having something
up their sleeve, as an advantage or some sort of extra spice that could
 shake things up around here. And I was trying to get Venus
to tell me what the heck it was, but she kept being very cagey about it. In terms of idol,
I really don't think Q has it. I don't think anyone has it,
unless you do. -Unless it's up your sleeve.
-No. (chuckles) No, no, no. -There's something else
up my sleeve.
-You're being all shifty. -No, I...
-What else is up your sleeve? There's something else
that's going on that I'll tell you about later,
but it's not an idol. And that's why I'm so adamant to
find this idol, too, by the way. Yeah. I'm curious why
you're not telling me now. -Because I want Q out for sure.
-Okay. And as soon as Q is out, we can have an open discussion -Yeah.
-about everything that will
guarantee us final four. -Okay. All right. No, no.
-And that's like, that's like... -I trust you. I trust you.
-Handshake.
No, handshake promise. -I trust you.
-Okay. CHARLIE:
 I'm trying to set up
 a final four deal with Venus, and she's stonewalling me on
something incredibly important. That, to me, is a red flag. So I've just got to think
about how to play this in a way that it doesn't sink my game. V talked to me,
 and she was like, ""I'm totally cool going
to the final four with you -and Ben and one other.""
-Of course. -'Cause she's a poser.
-Yeah. The other thing that V said is that she alluded to some advantage that somebody has. So it would either be her,
Liz or Kenzie who has it. BEN:
She's saying whatever
she can to get out of tonight. ""I want to get Q out."" -Yeah.
-V has got to go. Q is a heavy target
 we got to get out of the game, but at the same time,
 Venus also does have to go. My reason for Venus
having to go has nothing to do with her being a threat. She's just creating more
 and more chaos. She freaks out
 before every Tribal, and she's always running around
trying to pitch some crazy plan, and I'm sick
 of being around that. So I'd rather get her out first
before we get out anybody else. CHARLIE:
 My head is going in 22 different directions. It's being
pulled every which way, and I just have
to hope that I can figure out what's best for my game. But right now,
it's a big old storm cloud. KENZIE: Okay. CHARLIE:
...and they're gonna play it. -Venus is chaos. I don't
want Venus here, either...
-Yeah. I trust what you want to do. Okay. So whatever-whatever... KENZIE:
 I think that
 the boys are being babies and don't want
 to make a big move because they want
 to feel secure. Because if they get rid of Q, then they're more vulnerable. But I'm like,
""If I get rid of Venus, then I'm more vulnerable."" I just think it's foolish
to not take out the biggest threat in the game
while they're vulnerable. CHARLIE:
 The middle is a safe place
 to be and a dangerous place to be. It's a double-edged sword
and, frankly, it's a sword that has
a point also pointing at you. -I know.
I didn't know where you were.
-I was like... Even though
I might have power tonight, I could make a mistake that
sinks my game moving forward. So it's Venus, right? Is that what you're hearing? Yeah. The way people are
 talking about Q and Maria, working with them
could taint my image. Right now, I know
 I'm a little bit of a threat, but people are not mad at me. After tonight's vote,
 my main concern is can I pull people
 that I've burned back into a position
 that benefits me? And I don't know
 if I can do that if I burn people
 who are so dead set on getting Q out tonight. It might be the last straw,
 and I might be public enemy number one
 for stringing them along. So it's really, really tricky

to give Liz a chance. And I said,
""Let's rock paper scissors, 'cause I can't
make this choice."" Venus, you were clearly upset
that you weren't chosen. VENUS:
It's one thing to decide
who you're gonna take with on a reward,
but to start off by saying, ""You know,
I really want to choose someone ""who is physically weak and really needs
this reward, health-wise,"" and then put on this farce to ultimately choose the most
well-fed, fittest guy here-- it kind of felt like
a punch in the gut. -It kind of felt cruel,
you know?
-An act and a farce is... that's, to me, like daggers. That was the hardest decision
I had to make today. So if she
can stand there and say, ""That was an act and that was
a farce,"" I'd love for her to take that spot
and make the decision herself. I wouldn't
have prefaced the decision with that kind of comment. I would have just
made my decision and just been content with it. But, Jeff, if Venus
would have won the reward, she wouldn't have taken... -No way. (laughs) No way.
-Q: ...uh, Maria. She wouldn't have taken me.
You know what I'm saying? -We'll never know.
-Q: So... Uh, we know. -Trust me. Okay.
-We don't know. You can't sit there and say,
""Well, Venus never would have picked me,""
'cause you don't know. So... You wouldn't have. And that's a fact. Wow. Charlie, what's your take? CHARLIE:
So, I think the big theme
of this pizza reward is really ""decisions."" And no decision in Survivor weighs as much as who we are voting out at any given Tribal Council. So, you're thinking about who are you putting on the jury? Who are you leaving in the game
to work with you? And at this point in the game,
who am I going to sit next to at the end and have
the jury judge me against? Everything has consequences, and it makes this game just incredibly, incredibly hard. PROBST:
Kenzie, let's
talk about blindsides. When you're the architect
of a blindside, it's great. And yet you can't tell people because there are idols,
there are advantages. Tonight's the last night
you can use Shot in the Dark. Does that get
more and more pressurized as the days
get closer to the end? It's extremely pressurized. I mean, I got bamboozled
by a blindside last time, and it wasn't even me. So when it's getting down
to just seven, and everybody's telling you all these
different things, it's, like, so layered and weighted,
and you just have to put your faith in these people who
have literally blindsided you, even if it's not
your name written down. It's very jarring. Liz, it's really interesting
to hear Kenzie say that. That you get blindsided,
and then you might actually have to work
with the people who lied to you. Amen. I've been incredibly vocal. (laughs) I don't know how else to say it.
And I'm just... About what? (groans) -Okay, one more time.
One more time.
-LIZ: Sure. (groans) (sputters) -I'm just feeling...
-Okay. You've been
very vocal about what? About Q.
I mean, come on.
I-I feel like I... (groans) Like... Everybody's talking about,
""Oh, I want to make a big move. Let's blindside.
Let's do this."" I feel like I can't
trust anyone right now. It's like... Yeah, the-the Q and Liz
rock paper scissors. And it was like,
okay, in my head, Maria wants to play
with Q more than I thought. I don't know. It's... bleh. PROBST:
Q, did you hear your name
in the same way you have for the past few Tribals? Q:
Oh, yeah. I heard my name today. But, again, Jeff,
I approach the situation the same every time. You tell me something.
I tell you something. We agree. If I believe it, I'm going on about my way. If it's a lie, you will
put my fire out tonight. That's how I go.
I'm not gonna worry about it. But, you know, with the people that I've talked to, it seem like everybody's
on the same page. I don't know
if that page is my page or someone else's page. I guess we'll find out. Venus, how would
you describe camp today? Today was a bit different,
because up until the last vote, I've been in on what was
gonna happen, and like Kenzie, I was on the wrong side
of the vote for Tiff. So, although I felt like
I could trust everyone before, now it's like I don't know
who's telling me the truth, who's lying, which way
the vote's gonna go. 'Cause people just
love writing my name down. Oh, my name is out there,
as well, Jeff. But to be fair, everybody here knows to never, ever, ever, -ever, ever, ever, ever
-VENUS: And yet he did. -say a name in front of Venus.
-And yet he did. Why is that, Q?
Why do you think... Because what Venus will do is she'll come
up to you aggressively. -Never.
-""What do you want to do?"" You tell her a name,
this is what she's gonna do. -Run and tell this person.
-Straight-up... ""Oh, Liz said this.""
This person. -""Q said this."" This person...
-With Q, specifically, Jeff, -I made sure
not to talk strategy.
-No one talks game with her. -I'm done talking about it.
-VENUS: I would never
in a million years try and talk strategy
with this man voluntarily. And that's a fact. And last vote
proved that exactly, -with what happened to Tiff.
-Q: That's why you didn't
know about the last vote. 'Cause they didn't trust you. Mm-hmm, but I knew
about the previous three, and you didn't, so... -Ooh.
-(exclaims) -PROBST: Ben...
-(chuckles) ...every Tribal,
while entertaining, has been complicated. I don't think I've seen the cynicism and paranoia be played up to 11 the way it's been
the last few days. This is a prime example that some people are just
not gonna be on the same page. It's about making
it through the next vote, because one crew that will
do one vote together is probably
not gonna be a crew that'll do
a second vote together. And it's
been this constant shift since the beginning
of the merge. PROBST:
So then, Charlie,
what do you do? Sooner or later
you have to walk up those steps and write down a name. What is the final decider?
What do you go to? CHARLIE:
Even if you can't
trust someone, can you somehow point yourselves
in the same direction? You know, set up
your row of dominoes all in a line and make sure that they all tip over and send the right person home
for your individual game. So, you have to be
able to persuade people to point in the same direction. And I think that's
what tonight's about. All right.
It is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. ♪ ♪ Please get off the island. I'm sick of all your lies. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right.
I'll read the votes. First vote: Q. Venus. Kenzie. So, that's one vote Kenzie, one vote Q, one vote Venus. Venus. Two votes Venus,
one vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Venus. That's three votes Venus,
one vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Twelfth person voted out and the fifth member
of our jury: Venus. That's four. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. -VENUS: Great job, you guys.
-Love you, boo. Love you. Great game, sister. Venus, the tribe has spoken. -Great game, you guys.
-Time for you to go. -VENUS: You killed it.

 to camp completely alone, my head is just spinning,
 honestly. Like, on the one hand, I am just breathing the largest sigh of relief because I'm here
 and I'm in the game. But at the same time,
 it's not great to have, kind of,
 the spotlight on me, and I hope that I didn't piss anybody off. RACHEL:
 I'm feeling anxiety
 and relief, but still nervousness.
 But also, there's a huge question
of who gave me this advantage. -I know.
-Marco. Polo. -Rachel.
-RACHEL: Sorry, guys. -What a move tonight.
-RACHEL: Oh, my God. (overlapping chatter) Thank you. GABE:
Tribal did not go good tonight. You know, Rachel is
 a very threatening player. I was very excited
for her to leave tonight. (grunts) GABE:
 But she forced the Tuku five to cannibalize itself in front of everybody at Tribal. So, this was quite a disaster. -Safety without Power is crazy.

a genuine shock. TEENY: Yeah. I would love to know

 there is a connection there. And I'm working on building the SSAs-- Sol's Secret Agents. When you got up and left,

-(whoops) PROBST:
We got room for everybody. Let's have some fun today. Welcome to the Survivor auction
for Survivor 47. (cheering, whooping) This is a new-era auction, so let me remind you
how it works. This morning,
you had a money scramble where you raced into the jungle to try and find various amounts
of cash. The reason
for the money scramble is you all start the auction
with varying amounts of money. So let's take a look
at who got what. (cheering) All right, most money: Sierra. $1,060. And it goes down from there
all the way to Andy. Good news is, Andy,
you're not gonna lose your vote. You got to have
the most amount of money -at the end of the auction
to lose your vote.
-Yes. You don't have any money.
Bad news is, -you cannot bid on any items.
-Yup. PROBST:
So let's get to the items. We have 15 items
prepared for you today. But only the first five
are guaranteed. -GENEVIEVE: Ugh.
-PROBST: The additional number of items
will be determined by me drawing a random number -out of a bag
between six and 15.
-Wow. The reason this matters is the auction will end
without warning, and whoever has the most money at that point in the auction
loses their vote at the next Tribal Council. PROBST:
Let's see how many items
we're gonna have. Okay. I know the total number
of items that's going to be in the auction.
You don't. -So that's been determined.
-Oh, my goodness, buddy. The question is
how many items will there be? -Okay.
-Shall we get this auction going? -(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: All right. GENEVIEVE: Oh, no. -Ugh.
-PROBST: First item. First $60 buys it. -$60.
-$60 to Sol. Come on up. (whooping, cheering) Salted potato chips,
soft drink for 60 bucks. That might be the best buy
of the day. -Yeah, I think so.
-$60. -Ooh, want me
to try this, buddy?
-Try these for me, Sol. Oh, you got it, baby. RACHEL: Oh, that's a big bowl. -That's a big bowl.

right there was so money. -PROBST: Enjoy.

-Attaboy, Sol. -PROBST: Let's update the board.
-Thank you, thank you. Sol goes from $600 to $540. All right,
shall we get the next item? (all voicing assent) All right. Next item up for bid: mac and cheese. -All my money. All my money.
-Oh! -$640.
-Damn it! PROBST:
$640. The first bid by Teeny. Teeny, you're gonna spend

an amazing reward or am I walking gingerly -to sucker you in?

you're gonna contemplate as you bid
on this covered item. -$360.

-Uh, I didn't like
your acting job, Jeff. I'll let Kyle, uh,
take the cover off. -PROBST: Let's find out.
-Hey, Jeff? Uh, if there's meat under there, Kyle's not gonna be able
to eat it. Can I give you my $360 -on the shot that there's meat?
-Uh-uh. Uh-uh. This is one item. No sharing. Sold to Kyle. -Go, Kyle!
-TEENY: $560. PROBST:
All right, talk to me about the meat issue.
Sam said as long -as it's not meat, you're good.
-KYLE: Yeah. So, that's... You know,
I've been a vegan for, like, six plus years, and then
I switched to vegetarian not long ago just so that way, if I had the opportunity
to be here, I could have more options
available to me. That was part of why
you changed your diet, -was on the chance
you might get on Survivor? -(chuckles) -Wow!
-Oh, my God. -GENEVIEVE: Ugh.

because your reward comes with dairy,
and there is some meat. Here's what you bought. (all exclaiming) PROBST:

-TEENY: Oh, my God. PROBST:
...with ranch
and some celery and carrots. You know, this is horrible. Yeah.
So you're gonna take this back. There's no sharing of items. -Nobody can buy a buffalo wing
from you.
-Okay. KYLE:
I'll just take it all, you know. -PROBST: All right.
-Yeah. I would have liked that. Thank you, sir. (sniffing) Oh, you're thinking about it. Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna do it. If you're gonna do it,
let me see. All right, so my favorite
was always the wing, right? Oh, he's going for it. -This is a moment.
-(all exclaiming) My heart's pounding right now. -Really?
-Yeah, I'm... Well, why are you doing it? -I'm hungry.
-Okay. That feeling like you're about
to do something, and that something
might be wrong. -(whooping)
-SUE: Good job, Kyle. SAM:
Yay, Kyle. -(Probst laughs)
-It's turned me into an animal. How is it? I'm a little d-disappointed
in myself for caving, but if you're gonna cave,
this is a place to do it. -GENEVIEVE: Yeah.
-Good job, Kyle.
-PROBST: Enjoy. PROBST:
Kyle left with $20. -Let me get another item.
-SUE: Oh, my God. -Look how many there are.
-(sighs) (British accent):
Well, if I had ever been in Shakespeare in the park, -this is how I would do it.
-(laughing) Sir, I present
to you the most beautiful of Survivor auction items. I don't know what's in here.
If you don't like it, I'm merely the messenger. $660. (regular accent):
$660 to Gabe. -Gabe buys it. Sold to Gabe.
-Go, Gabe. -SAM: Good job. Good job.
-Oh, good luck, Gabe. For all the money he has. So the good news is
you can't lose your vote. Well, if you're having
a bad feeling, you can trade it. Oh, Gabe. -SUE: Yikes.
-PROBST: For this. Yeah. -Sticking with the fish guts.
-Sticking with the fish guts? Okay. What you bought was... a very fresh... coconut filled with very cold water. -Oh, no, Gabe.
-PROBST: All of your money. (sighs)
Makes me stronger. SUE:
Sorry, Gabe. -(overlapping chatter)
-Just like that, $660 gone. PROBST: From this point forward, any item could be the last item, which means
if it is the last item, whoever has the most money after
that item loses their vote. Sixth item in the auction. -$380.
-$380 to Sue. -$540.
-540 to Sol. Come on up, Sol.
Sold to Sol for $540. He got the first item. This is his second item
in the auction. Take that from you. This is what $540
bought you, Sol. -SIERRA: Oh, you were right!
-SOL: Oh, my God. PROBST:
A giant apple pie, whipped cream,
which I will let you put on. I got the wrong item, dude. -PROBST: Put the 47 on there?
-SOL: 47, baby. -PROBST: Doesn't have
to be pretty. That looks good.
-Yeah. -What's this?
-Well, this $60, Sol. It's called the Survivor cash-back program. Some items come -with money
that go back to you.
-(all exclaiming) -So you will go back with $60.
-Right. Before you do that,
take a bite of the pie. Oh, yeah. That's how you eat a pie
on Survivor right there. -How delicious is it?
-PROBST: Wow.
-SOL: Oh, man. Take it back.
Take your money back. Enjoy. (whooping) PROBST:
So, Solomon is still in it. If that was the last item,
Rachel, with $500, you would have the most money
and you would lose your vote. Okay. -There is another item.
-SIERRA: Yay. -Yeah.
-SUE: Yay! RACHEL:
Ooh! -Oh, my God.
-Oh, wow. Next item up for bids
will remain covered. -$500, Jeff.
-$500 to Rachel. Come on up. Rachel, out of the
possibility of losing her vote, which may be
the most important thing. $500. Thank you. -What's your feeling right now?
-I have a feeling it could be bad, but
I also have a feeling that... -It could be good?
-There might... I might... For whatever reason,
when you came out, I was like, ""I think
there's a burger in there."" Wow. (cheering) PROBST:
How does this happen? I feel like I should
take a bite, probably. Yes, take a bite. Take a bite. PROBST:
That's a Survivor burger
right there. -TEENY: Oh, my God.
-SIERRA: Get in there. Oh, my God. -GENEVIEVE: Hey, Rachel.
-PROBST: All right. Take it back and enjoy. Wow. -Well done manifesting.
-Oh, my God. -I just, like, felt it.
-PROBST: All right. Genevieve, at $440... ...you have the most buying
power right now in the auction, if there's another item. If there is not another item
and that was it, you will lose your vote
at tonight's Tribal Council. There is another item -in this auction.
-RACHEL: Oh, my God. I thought he said they're isn't. Sorry. -I'll go get it.

""Sure, you have my blessing."" RACHEL: At the auction,
 inside the fries was a note that I desperately want to read,
but I'm very scared to take out because
 there's people everywhere. But I finally get a moment
 where I'm going to check on my clothes
 at the clothesline, and I have a moment to myself. Oh, my God. Okay. Wish I would have known that
last night when I was alone in the shelter. Oh, my God. This is the auction jackpot. Like, I couldn't
have scored better. I have been down and out
 Tribal after Tribal. So an idol would give me the most power
that I could possibly have in this game right now. But there's two tarps
 at this camp. Is it at the top? Am I gonna
 have to, like, climb a tree to get to the corner
 of this tarp? My mind is just going nuts. So, I walk by it
 and kind of do, like, a... a little corner check
 and I see a tiny little lump in the corner of the tarp. Definitely it.
 There's something in there, but my brain is reeling on how I'm ever
gonna get this idol. I can't just, like,
 slash the tarp, because there are people at camp at all times, like,
mingling around the shelter. TEENY:
I want you to try
and braid my hair for funsies. I'm thinking business
on the sides, party in front. SIERRA:
 Sam and I-- we are, like, a very strong alliance
and, like, a duo out here. So him losing his vote--
 it's a little scary at this time in the game. We know we have four members
 of Gata, but obviously, you think of the numbers. We need to recruit more. And it just came naturally
with Lavo. Like, I feel great with them,
 I feel great connections. So let's work together and knock out Tuku one by one. I think we have
all formed, like, a great bond with all
of you, like, from Lavo. Like, you, Sol -and, um, Genevieve.
 -TEENY: Genevieve. SIERRA:
 So it's, like, I don't want to break any of that right now. RACHEL:
What, uh, so, what's our plan? Are we just Lavo and Gata? -I would love that.
-SIERRA: I know.
I think right now, we're like,
""Let's just knock out Tuku."" Well, there is a part of me,
also, that would love to, you know,
if we're getting Tukus, for it to be the male Tukus. SIERRA: I think if Kyle loses
in an immunity challenge, -like, that has
to be our first target.
-TEENY: Yeah. TEENY:
 I think the Gata and the Lavo people have kind of formed
this alliance together. And the name that we're all throwing around
 right now is Kyle because he's won the past two
 individual immunities. So, if Kyle loses
 the next challenge, he'd be the easy decision. GENEVIEVE:
I want to catch you and Caroline specifically up on yesterday,
and I'd love, if you don't mind, to catch up on what I missed
with you guys. Um... SUE:
You didn't miss much.
We were so focused on... -Was it gonna be Rachel?
-Yeah. Yeah. That would have been good. GENEVIEVE:
 Right now, I believe Teeny is trying to work
 with the former Gata members. We all know they're so charismatic,
they're so big and strong. But they are the most dangerous
 to me on this beach. So, I'd like to shake things up
 and steer the next vote towards one
of the former Gata members. GENEVIEVE:
I think Sam is charming. But I do not want to sit
with him at the end. -CAROLINE: No.
-SUE: Mm-hmm. But I'd like to keep some
of those obvious targets around. -You know what I mean?
-Yes. I don't know how
you guys feel about that, but I'm almost inclined to... target, like, Rachel over Sam. Yes. Genevieve is a smart cookie. She is planting the seeds
 for a big move against Gata. And I'm like, ""Damn,
that's what I wanted to do."" That's exactly what
I wanted to do. Go, Genevieve. -It's more under the radar.
 -GENEVIEVE: Yes. It's more under the radar. CAROLINE:
 Genevieve and I see Gatas are way too charismatic
and have way much control, and one of them has to go. Sam is an obvious choice, but Rachel is the sneaky,
dangerous one. GENEVIEVE:
I was, like, scratching my hand. I thought I was so tan, and then
I just scratched it off, -and I'm pale.
-(laughs) It's just dirt. I really want to get the idol. Unfortunately, this camp has not
been empty since I got the clue. But there was this point where almost everybody was
 in the shelter. They were all chitchatting, and I was like,
""I think this is my chance."" I am looking around, trying not to look suspicious. I don't want anybody
 to know about it. I want that power
to stay with me. I don't want it to be exposed. I flipped up the edge
 of the tarp so I could do it from underneath so no one
 could see that it was ripped. Oh, oh, oh. RACHEL:
 My heart is racing. I'm freaking out.
 I'm trying to get through it. I don't know how long
 it's gonna take. (indistinct chatter in distance) RACHEL:
 Oh, my God. I got it. Look at this guy. Survivor bucket list. I genuinely can't believe
 I pulled it off in broad daylight
 in front of a lot of people. Last night, I was seconds
 from being voted out, and now, I'm holding a... an idol
that nobody knows about. That is the epitome of, like,
 a Survivor turnaround. ♪ ♪ Your pain shouldn't be

the death of me tomorrow. SAM: With Kyle and Sue
off the table and safe, Gabe is, by far, a bigger threat than Caroline is
 at this point in the game. Here is my only thought. -I'm a little bit
more scared of Gabe.
-Same. -Yeah.
-RACHEL: Do you think
we need to split or do you think
we should just keep it clean? I think we can keep it clean. SAM: Yeah. SOL:
Okay. SAM:
The Gata-Lavo alliance has been a very natural and easy thing
 for all of us. And before you know it, there ain't gonna
be any more Tuku left. I feel like I was, like... I just wanted
to catch up with you guys. -Yeah.
-And it sounds like... -I feel a little behind,
that's all.
-Yeah. You know, Andy has just been somebody we're...
we've been keeping around 'cause he's still
 in Sam and I's pocket. He's just, like, an easy number
 that we could use. He's not a threat,
 he's not somebody I'm worried about in the game. So I'm, like, you know,
might as well drag him along a little longer until, you know,
we can no longer tolerate him. But we just want to make sure -that you're still strong
with us.
-I am. -And, like, that we still
have you locked in.
-Yeah. -You swear?
-Yes, that is...
I swear, that is... -I'm still your island sister?
-Island sister, yeah. Sam and Sierra still feel like they own me, and they have me
in their pockets. They look at me
 as an expendable piece, and as sort of a weak player. SIERRA:
 He came over to me,
 and he was like, ""I'm having a really bad day,""
and I'm, like... I just feel like the guy's had
a series of bad days. -It's really sad.
-I know. ANDY:
 And so, for me, that's
 enough to just cut bait. Like, goodbye. I feel like this is my, like, She's All That makeover moment. I'm starting this game
just like, ""Oh, hi, I'm Andy.
Like, please like me. ""Um, Sierra and Sam,
 like, you're the cool kids. Like, can you... can I sit
 at your lunch table?"" And now I'm at the merge. And I'm getting a lot cooler
 and, like, I don't need to wear these freaking glasses
 anymore, and I could be... the Andy that
I believe myself to be. I could be my full version
of myself. And I can turn into the pivotal
player in this post-merge. Sam and Sierra. -And so...
-You don't have
to work with them anymore. -(laughs)
-Let's do it. -Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah. It's looking really good. ANDY:
 I can make my own lunch table.
 Sam, Sierra and Rachel-- they're gonna be
 shocked by the new Andy. They're not gonna
 see me coming, and... that was stupid. (laughs) Like, I've been doing a lot. I've been doing a lot
behind their backs. I feel like I'm a Lavo. I love hearing that. ANDY:
 I want to build an alliance
 with myself, Lavo and Tuku, and I think splitting up Sam and Sierra
is of the utmost importance. They're gonna be like,
""Damn, Andy did that. Our Andy? Wait, no.
He was gonna be our goat."" -I'm looking to change my fate.
-Yeah. Just have a number of people
who we're actually working with. -Yeah. That's awesome.
-Yeah. We can just line 'em up and take 'em all out
one by one, you know. -That's promising.
I'm down for that.
-I mean... GABE:
 It is perfect, a chef's kiss. You know, however many Gata he wants to turn on,
that works for me. -I feel pretty good
that he's voting with us.
-Yeah. Yeah. GABE: That's the question.
I don't know. KYLE: I think Sam's more of a
physical threat, but she is.... -The social game's
the dangerous part.
-GABE: Yeah. I see Sierra as the head of the snake
 right now of Gata, and it's fitting,
because Gata's logo is a snake. So, I mean, there you go. You know, I think it'll be
 a good time to disarm 'em. And whether
it's Sam or Sierra or... Like, how do you feel
about that? -SOL: Yeah.
-Yes. -You're in?
-Yeah. GABE:
 If there are
 eight people strong, being the four Tukus,
the three Lavos and Andy,
Sierra will be out of the game. TEENY:
I think the easy thing to do,
which we could all, like, see right now is to work with
the Gatas and get a Tuku out. Right? Like, Gabe,
because whatever. Um... I kind of want
to work with the Gata... -Not the Gata, but Tuku.
-GENEVIEVE: Tuku? -SOL: Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Me, too. Would you rather lose Sam,
Sierra or Rachel? SOL:
I think it would be Sierra. TEENY: Right now
 I'm in sort of a pickle where Sierra is somebody who I feel
like I'm very good friends with. Working with her in this game
 is something I want to do. But I don't want to take the reins and be
too pushy about anything. GENEVIEVE:
Are you gonna be choked? I know you're tight
with Sierra and Sam. -Like, honestly.
-TEENY: Um... -Okay.
-I'm tight with Sierra. So I would want Sam to be
the Gata who goes home tonight. My hope is that I can convince
 everybody to vote Sam out. I am very, very scared of him. He's the bigger threat. As far as this vote goes, like, if I had my way,
it would be Sam. You want Sierra out over Sam? 'Cause that's not my preference. Sam is the biggest threat
 of the three of them. I think he's the head
of the Gata snake. I think he is charming.
He gets everybody laughing. Sam? Agreed. -Hey, hey.
-TEENY: Look at that. My vote's going on Sam tonight. That's for sure. I'd like to break up Sam
and Sierra, but... GENEVIEVE:
If they're nervous and they have an idol,
they wouldn't play it on Rachel. -SUE: Right.
-She's not in their duo. Rachel may be the easier one
to go for 'cause they would never
play it on Rachel. CAROLINE:
 Voting out Gatas is in almost everyone's
 best interest. I personally would
 love Rachel to leave. I think she's the best player in this game right now. I think she is the most
dangerous. I want her gone. -CAROLINE: I would like Rachel.
-Yeah. Genevieve would like Rachel. -Really?
-Yeah. Why? About where everyone is? I know it's weird
that everyone's, like, gone. Something just doesn't
 feel right to me. I want to feel good
in this kind of Gata-Lavo, like, union. But they're still having a lot
 of conversations with people. RACHEL:
 You just don't know
 what's gonna happen, but what I do know
is that I have an idol that nobody knows about. Now, it's, like,
 the pressure's on that I know when and if
 I need to play it. I want to go Rachel. SOL:
 I've put too much damn work in helping out Rachel to have her go home tonight. I just want
to split up that duo. Rachel can be someone
we can use. GENEVIEVE:
Rachel's my ultimate preference
 to go home. But there are many different
cooks in the kitchen, and we want different things. If you ask Teeny,
 she wants Sam out. Sol wants Sierra out,
 and I would take out Rachel. She's a strategic thinker,
 she's social. I see her as a huge threat. And in this group
 that will be voting together, what are the odds all eight of us
are gonna be like, ""Hey, yeah, that's the target,
we all agree""? Slim to none. [b ar ks ] ♪ There is no life,

you all will have a say in who wins,
if not be one of the people vying for it at the end. So, Sam,
where is the game right now and where do you think
it's heading? SAM:
The game is... waiting for war, and you don't want to be the one that's still getting ready while everybody else
is already in battle. Gabe, agree? GABE:
I mean, is there
a war coming? Sure. Survivor is a war.
It always is, but there's a lot
of moving parts, and folks were lied to today, but that's what
Tribal Council's for. Your pen goes to parchment, and it reveals
your true intentions. PROBST:
Andy, how about for you? Well, I'm glad everyone's
still getting ready for war. I got two votes at the last
Tribal Council I attended, so, I'm under attack already. Like, the battle cries
are sounding. Like, I'm at war.
And so, we're trying to see what factions are linking up and what factions
are gonna be left to be vulnerable to this first attack, which is
tonight, which is a big night. Gabe? Just to stick
with our war analogy-- that seems to be the theme
of Tribal Council tonight. -It's working.
-GABE: Yeah. So, Christmas Day
of World War I, I believe, there was a ceasefire,
and both sides came together, and they played a game
of soccer. And then the very next day, they just went back to
throwing bullets at each other. And that's what auction day
kind of felt like. -Yeah, you're right.
-It felt like we all had a ceasefire. And then, the next morning,
you wake up, and shots start firing again. PROBST:
Teeny, why were you nodding? What was it
about what Gabe said? You know, we've all enjoyed
these milestones of Survivor together--
making the merge, making the jury, at this point. The next goal
is making it to the end. So, yeah, we're friends, but it's not a game of friends.
It's a game of Survivor. And there's only one winner. PROBST:
Genevieve, is a group this large just as scary if not scarier than a group of five? GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, because
in a group of five, to have a majority,
you need three, which means you need
to rely on two people. In a group this big, you need
to rely on many more people. And relying on anyone but yourself is... treacherous in Survivor. PROBST:
And Sierra,
to Genevieve's point, there's also trust. You can have all the numbers
stored perfectly, but if the information's bad, -then the numbers are bad.
-SIERRA: Jeff, school didn't come
that easy to me. And keeping all these numbers
and names and, like, putting all the pieces
together-- it's something that is really taking a toll on me
mentally, 'cause I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh, how do you
keep track of all this?"" But as far as tonight goes, we will see
where our trust lies, short-term and
long-term alliances, you know, starting from back
when it was just Gata, but also now,
we all have new alliances. And truthfully, I think tonight is, like, a huge outcome of what the rest of the game
will look like. PROBST:
Sam, you were nodding. -You agree?
-SAM: Yeah, I do. It's a lot more difficult
to be a shepherd when you got more animals
to keep track of. It's scary.
You want to have your finger on the pulse of the game,
vote or no vote. Like, you want
to feel like you know where things are kind of headed. But you start to wonder like, ""Is there something
I'm missing?"" PROBST:
Kyle, if the vote
goes the way you think it's gonna go, will it be about a group, an alliance
getting their way, or is it taking out
a threat in the game? KYLE:
We're all standing here
like a bunch of gladiators
ready to brawl in an arena. I think that if you
stand out as a threat, then you're probably
going to get hit. So it's, like, in a sick way, almost a compliment,
saying, like, ""Hey, like, you're really good at this game,
and I need you to not be."" -(chuckling)
-PROBST: Caroline, -you agree with that?
-Absolutely. I honestly think, at this point,
if you're targeted, it's a huge sign of, like,
respect and admiration. PROBST:
Andy, how certain are you
that you know where the vote is going? Um... I have a plan. I have a name in mind, and I do feel pretty confident that that is what's
gonna happen. Now, that's not always
been the case. Actually, you know,
my last Tribal Council, I felt confident,
and I was surprised. Point being,
people will be left out and be upset. PROBST:
All right, group question. How many people here
are uncomfortable that you could be
completely wrong? So, nobody here really has any certainty. Teeny, is this
an obvious question or does it speak
to where this game is right now? I mean, there's never
any certainty at Tribal Council, and if you feel it,
then you should be in trouble, and you usually are. But especially
at an 11-person Tribal Council, where we have not truly tested our trust
with each other. And I think it's monumental, because it's an indicator
of what to come. What happens tonight
is really going to show that, you know, there's a level
of play going on here that we haven't yet seen. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Sol, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Jeff? I thought I knew what was going on
coming into this Tribal tonight, but the longer
the Tribal went on, the more this feeling of dread filled my stomach. Um, and I was supposed
to go home last Tribal, and I don't want any shoulda, coulda, wouldas, so, -SUE: Good for you.
-I played my Shot in the Dark. Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Thank you. PROBST:
So, Rachel played her
Shot in the Dark, which means there is no vote in here
from Rachel. If this says you're safe, then any votes cast
for Rachel will not count. Rachel, you are... ...not safe. Any votes cast
for Rachel will still count. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Gabe. Sam.
Two votes Sam. Sierra. -Wow.
-PROBST: Two votes Sam, one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra. Sam.
That's three votes Sam, one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra. Sierra. That's three votes Sam, two votes Sierra, one vote Gabe. Sam. That's four votes Sam,
two votes Sierra, one vote Gabe. Sierra. -Wow.
-That's four votes Sam, three votes Sierra,
one vote left. Sierra. -We're tied.
-... Wow. PROBST:
Sam and Sierra both have four votes, so we're gonna revote. But this is a unique situation that needs an explanation. Typically, when you have
two players who are tied, they don't vote simply because they can only vote
for each other, so their votes
nullify each other. That's the only reason
they don't vote. That's not the case tonight.
Sam, you don't have a vote. You didn't cast a vote. Sierra
does, and she did cast a vote. So, Sierra,
you will vote in the revote. -Wow.
-So everybody will vote except Sam and Rachel,
who played her Shot in the Dark. And you can only vote
for Sierra or Sam. All right, Sol, you're up.
Will you come grab the urn? I acknowledge
I'm doing you dirty, but I'm a dirty player. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Sierra. One vote Sam,
one vote Sierra. Sierra. Two votes Sierra,
one vote Sam. That's three votes Sierra,
one vote Sam. Sierra. That's four votes
Sierra, one vote Sam. Eighth person
voted out of Survivor 47 and the first member
of our jury: Sierra. That's five. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. SIERRA:
Yeah. If I'm the biggest threat
sitting here, it's pretty... -I'm pretty honored,
so, thank you.
-Good game. SIERRA:
Well done, guys. Sierra, the tribe has spoken. -Can I have a hug?
-Course. -Pleasure having you out here.
-(Sierra muttering) -Oh. Bye, Sierra.
-Bye, Sierra. GENEVIEVE:

 Sol... Yes? TEENY:
You got anything to say
right off the bat? I'm glad I'm still here, but, uh, yeah,
I mean, you guys got me. Well played. At Tribal Council tonight, my ass got blindsided. And the people who I thought
 were my allies, Kish and Teeny, they went against
what I thought was gonna happen. And Rome is still here. That's what
 I'm more upset about. We know who Rome is.
We know what kind of guy he is. -ROME: I know you voted for me.
-Yep. And, uh... It was part of the plan--
what I thought was the plan. And you voted for me? No. -SOL: Who voted for me?
-We'll talk. SOL:
 I'm at the bottom of my tribe. I have to quickly get over it,
and I have to get my mind right. Otherwise, I'm going home. -I just want to say I'm sorry...
-Okay. ...because I voted for you,
and I need to explain that. -You voted for me?
-Yes. Okay. And I know that goes against
every promise I made to you, and I understand
if you're pissed. I'd love to claim
 the vote for Sol as purely this mastermind strategic plan,
but that's not entirely true. I could not fathom
 writing Aysha's name down because of
 my emotional bond with her. You know, this isn't a moment where I'm like, ""Yes,
we just nailed a blindside."" It's a moment where I am upset. I-I think that's gonna haunt me. I think that's gonna be, like... This is a game. And if the people playing
the game can't handle that, that's on them. It's not on you. -Okay?
-I know, but, like, am I the person
who can't handle it is really... You're gonna be able to... I wanted to come out here
and be this villainous mastermind player
who was able to make decisions based purely off
how I could advance in the game. But at the same time,
 I know myself. I'm sensitive. And that's something that
I just have to learn to balance as I move forward in this game. No. That's why I was very-- I was,

I feel like
we all played that perfectly. And now we have
the majority alliance. We got a solidified alliance. Like, we're,
we're ready to roll. (chuckles) Tonight, Tribal Council went

 Freestyling,
 going with the flow is kind of
 how I'm playing Survivor. And right now Sierra is my number one. The two of us

 came back from the journey, she said

are working together. We're not dating,

is giving them that vibe? I'm not sure. You've spent so much alone time

 that I am a badass pilot, and I'm an adrenaline junkie always looking for a rush. I'm here for the journey.
I'm here for the thrill of it. And this is exciting because
 nobody would ever suspect that I've been spending my time
 secretly looking for an idol. I want that power.
I want that protection. I want the thrill
 of finding an idol. Ah. Oh. No way. It is
 a freaking Beware Advantage. I couldn't open
that packet fast enough. The map was giving me
 very specific instructions. Now I got to get this. But if I don't find
that palm tree and get my idol, I don't vote. So it's behind the water well. Going that direction. The rope was hidden in vines. But now that I knew
 what I was looking for, that rope stood out
 like a sore thumb. ♪ ♪ A bucket fractures, and paint just bursts
all over the place. And I see the idol there. I have no idea
 what I'm gonna do. Obviously, I don't want

 blood splattered everywhere. And I need to cover my tracks because I don't want anybody
knowing that I have an idol. ♪ ♪ It is literally

to get rid of all the evidence, knowing that the police
 are coming any second. I've got to cover up everything so that nobody knows it's me. I have paint on my legs.
 It's on the water well. And then, on top of that,
 the trees had paint on them. It's just out of control. I'm gonna kill Jeff
for making this so hard. It's taking me forever, but I slowly see progress. And finally,
 I got rid of all the evidence. Not one person will ever,
 ever know I have a hidden immunity idol. I pulled it off. I pulled it off. Hey. How was your walk? Yeah, I'm just chilling. No, I'm good. I'm good. I just wanted to chill

 Last night, I played my idol
 that was good for one Tribal. Usually,
 that idol gets replaced. -TEENY: This is tough.
-Yeah. You know, I know that
 I'm probably the best one at looking for idols
on my tribe, which is a comforting thing, but everyone right now
 is looking for idols. No. ROME:
 Sol is looking hard
 for this idol, and that is very scary. We want to make sure that, no matter what, Sol cannot find this idol.
Anyone but Sol. Anyone but Sol. If you're gonna
keep looking for one, that's... Yeah, that's more
of a threat than someone just sitting back at camp
trying to be kumbaya. Really, dude? I know what he's doing. He wants to vote me out,
and he's trying to prevent me from searching for idols
so I don't get one. And he's threatening me
 to do that. I'm just saying,
there's a time to do it and there's a time not to. And, like,
the people at the top, they kind of have
that freedom to do it. But, like, I don't know
why you would just increase the target on your back. SOL:
 He's, like,
 ten years younger than me, and he's talking to me
 like I'm a kid. What the hell? What? What's happening right now? And again, I got to go Zen. (imitates chant) ""Sol, relax."" ROME:
 I don't want him
 looking for an idol at all. That's gonna be a problem. We're fine
if he doesn't find it. -ROME: Yeah.
-Which, at this moment,
he hasn't. Sol and Rome
 are on opposite planets, and that is a positive for me. I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos, which is why I've been pushing
 for them to continue clashing, so they will not work
 with each other. I think my strength
 is getting to know people, really understanding them, and then being able
to beautifully manipulate them. I've never been
a babysitter before. Really? -ROME: No.
-That was my first job. Hey, we're going
looking for an idol, guys, if you guys want to come. I'm just going
to refill my water. ♪ ♪ I am now going
to go get coconut after this. With Rome, it's either his way or ""I'm gonna pout
 like a five-year-old"" way. He's gonna throw
 the biggest tantrum. I ain't trying to deal
with that all day long. 'Cause it's exhausting
and it's messing my game up. Could I have
a minute alone, please? -No. It's Survivor. I don't have to.
-Seriously? I'm-a follow you around. Now, can I, can I sit over there
by the beach alone? -Like...
-I'm-a sit right next to you.
That's fine. All right. Whatever. TEENY:
 It is about as awkward
 as awkward can be. I know that Rome is just trying
 to protect our four, but, like,
 he just plays the game at an intensity level
that is not a match with my own. He's not looking
for anything right now. And he's devoid
 of any sort of concept of what Sol might be feeling as one, a player, and two, you know, a grown man, a human being on this Earth. It's just a lot. So much. Oh, I'm sorry, Sol. It's all good. That's really not how I,
personally, want to play. -You're not out.
-All right. -They can knock you down,
but they can't get you out.
-Right. Yeah. Of course I feel bad for Sol. Rome is being rude,
 and, you know, Rome and I have a really good
relationship and are very close, but it's also
 a complicated relationship for me to navigate because he's such a big personality
and does rub people the wrong way. I think each
of our mistakes was getting a little too locked in with what
we thought dynamics were -and not being
fluid enough, you know?
-Yes. Absolutely. Please don't tell Rome
I'm saying this. You and I, if you allow it, -we are allies moving forward.

 a little guidance is all. I think
 we're still working on it. Big work in progress, but... he's a bit of
a clumsy player at times. All right, all right, all right. Andy's kind of

 one step ahead of him and that he's always coming
back to me with the information. As long as

that Breadwinners name, I know she's with me, because I know she's throwing
that alliance under the bus. She's throwing it away. And I believe,
 truly, that she's down to work with myself and Sam. I feel like I can tell you
everything Sierra tells me. -Yeah.

the most amazing conversation with her this morning. She said not to say it
 to anyone. I asked her how specific
 that these other women get about,
like, what, their alliance. She's like,
""Oh, they get specific. We're called the Breadwinners."" -That's what they call it?
-Yeah. If she's
telling us the name, then... -we win.
-Wow. The Breadwinners.
 I haven't heard that before. Sierra and I,
 we're supposed to be riding for each other,
 no matter what. Why are you not coming to me
with that kind of information? -You're my number one, so
I'm gonna tell you everything.
-Yeah. Andy tells me
that you told him about a... alliance name
that the three girls have. -Rachel said that she's
calling us the Breadwinners.

that's not where I'm going. -You know I have to play it off.
-I know, but if, you know,
if, like... -Okay.
-No, but why didn't
you tell me that stuff? SIERRA:
 I didn't say, ""Hey, girls, let's
be called the Breadwinners."" I didn't come up with that. I'm going along with it because I'm doing what
 I think is best for my game. Andy, right now, is... He-he scares me. I don't... Why? I don't think
Andy's gonna be loyal to me. But we don't
have to go with Andy yet. If-if we're at four, we can
always go with one of the girls. I don't know if that's
what makes sense for me either. SAM:
 Sierra thinks Andy needs to go at the next
Tribal Council, and, uh, that ain't gonna work for me. Keeping Andy is absolutely essential to my game. I don't see a world
where it's the four of us, and the two of them
aren't wanting to get me out. Yeah, but that's not
gonna happen because of me. Sam and I are just completely
 bumping heads right now. We might need Survivor's alliance therapy at this point because we're just going

Look, we have an egg in there! (Anika gasps) SIERRA:
Hello, are you the animals? RACHEL: The idea of eating,
 like, some juicy, hot chicken right now
just makes me want to just die in a pool of drool. But there are politics involved
 in whether to kill
or not kill the chickens. We do have to feed them
to keep 'em strong. Is anybody opposed
to just eating them? They can eat grass. So I kind of...
I-I... I don't know. ANIKA:
I want eggs. I'd rather keep getting meals
out of them. -I think so, too.
-Yeah.
-And that's protein. SAM:
I do want to eat one
at one point. (laughs)
There's a lot of meat there. SIERRA:
 I cannot kill the chickens.
Like, I can't do this. Chickens are near and dear
 to my heart. We go to wineries
 that have chickens. I feed them,
I hold them, I pet them. I love chickens. -(clucking)
-Oh! -Oh, my God.
-Sounds like he's got to go. SIERRA:
No. SAM:
 My first thought when we win is, ""Thank you! Some food, some protein."" But Sierra doesn't want
 to kill the chickens. She wants to just wait around
 and hope that there's gonna be dozens and dozens of eggs
that hatch. -SIERRA: Sam!
-What? SIERRA:
The chicken's out! Grab the chicken! SAM:
 I'm eight days without food. I don't care anymore.
Just give me the green light, and that chicken, uh, will... You know,
it's going to the butcher shop. (clucking) GENEVIEVE:
Well, that was embarrassing. ROME:
That was very embarrassing. -I think we just
collectively know...
-SOL: Yeah. -...we're not good...
-At puzzles. ...at those type...
those types of puzzles. ROME:
 I put myself in the final
 position to do the puzzle. I definitely want
to be the person that's in that clutch role. Yeah, not getting one piece
was demoralizing. Yeah. ROME:
 And honestly, I was just absolutely awful. All right, well,
you guys ready to go wash off? GENEVIEVE:
I don't know
if I'm gonna go in the water. It's so chilly. KISHAN: I don't think
I'm gonna go in the water. ROME: Fortunately,
 I have faith in the core four. So even though Gata chose Teeny
 to go on the journey, in our heads
 we already know the game plan. It's gonna be Sol. It's just
about how it goes down. So we all know the plan. It just sucks
that it had to happen now. I feel like
I should at this point. ROME:
 I still have the Steal a Vote
 in my pocket, so, if I feel like Sol might
 play his Shot in the Dark, guess what.
 I can use the Steal a Vote and make sure he can't play
 his Shot in the Dark, because you have to have a vote in order
to play a Shot in the Dark. I'd rather try and convince him -of another plan
and at least see how he...
-If he bites? Like, we can get a vibe
whether he believes it or not. But the thing is, I don't want
 to use this Steal a Vote, because if we, as an alliance,
 can keep this advantage, then we'll be sitting really
pretty heading into the merge. I do think
we can maybe give him a name and make him feel comfortable. Does Genevieve sound believable? 'Cause we could always push,
 like, we need tribe strength. We feel she's given the least. That's probably
the most believable. KISHAN:
 Rome proposes,
 ""Let's maybe try to see ""if we can comfort Sol
 in this fake plan that the vote is gonna be
 on someone else."" And I was like, ""Maybe. What about Genevieve? ""You know,
strength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve?"" Just 'cause
I do not want my name heard. It hasn't been heard yet.
I don't want it out there. ROME:
Do you think there's any way
we could convince him to give up his Shot in the Dark? Be like, ""I am taking your vote
if you don't vote with us."" -Yeah.
-And we can say
that it's gonna be Genevieve. Like, I could just
straight-up threaten him. I'd have no problem doing that. Yeah. That works. Anything that works. I feel actually
pretty good about that. ROME:
It might be a little villainous. You know,
I could strong-arm Sol tonight, and little does he know that he's gonna be
gone regardless. But at the end of the day,
at least I'll let him choose
how he goes out. -What?
-Just-just wait, just... I feel like if I give him that ultimatum, I feel like
he might actually break. It's more than likely
gonna be you tonight. But hear me out. I'm willing
to work with you for this vote to make it the way
that we want to. The way that we'll be able
to do it is because -I have a Steal a Vote.
-Dude. I will use this Steal a Vote
on Genevieve tonight. But the only way
that I'm doing that, -and I'm letting you
know that...
-Yeah? ...is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark. I'm letting you know,
if you don't give me your Shot in the Dark,
I'm using the Steal a Vote on you tonight, and then you can't play
your Shot in the Dark anyway. I'm letting you know that right
now, and you'll be going home. -I have the advantage...
-What are you talking about,
bro? You're, like,
threatening me right now. This isn't a threat. I'm just
letting you know the situation. -Is this real life, bro?
-This is Survivor, bro. SOL:
 I was like, ""Bro, really?
 It's like, you can't be
 threatening people."" But, you know, the villain
on this season is Rome. ""Congratulations.
This advantage allows you ""to steal a vote
from another player at Tribal Council."" Blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. SOL:
 It's a slap in the face,
 'cause, uh, nobody,
especially of Rome's size, has ever talked to me
 the way he has, and I don't plan on working
 with him ever in this game. And then here's the thing.
Here's the thing. -How can I...?
-That's fine. If you don't want to do it,
that's fine. I'm using my Steal a Vote
on you tonight, and you'll be going home. I can't believe
you're doing this to me, dawg. Down to the water. -To what?
-The water. -SOL: You just threatened me.
 -ROME: That's not a threat. It's an ultimatum.
That's not a threat. -That's an ultimatum.
-Oh, okay. -An ultimatum is not a threat.
-Okay. My bad. My fault. KISHAN:
 You know, the obvious vote is,
 we vote for Sol, and then, on the other hand,
 you have Rome. His thing is, ""It's my show.
You know, Lavo is Rome."" And I'm starting
 to get sick of it. He's playing chaotically.
 That scares me. You know, I can trust him now.
Can I trust him in the future? -Yeah.
-Even if he steals a vote, -that's two votes on Sol.
-Yeah. Even if Teeny loses her vote,
if us two vote Rome... -And it's...
-Rome will die. He will die. -I know.
-You're...
I can see you grinning. -Bad boy. Bad boy. (laughs)
-Ooh. -Naughty, naughty.
-Naughty, naughty. KISHAN:
 I want to switch the vote
 onto Rome because I think
 the true benefit of this is Rome is super tight
with Genevieve. Once Rome's gone,
 that leaves Genevieve in a really vulnerable position. Okay. Dude, I'm ready
to go to Tribal now. KISHAN:
 If we get out Rome, and
 we let Sol in, into the plan, Sol now trusts me because I have created the plan
to save him. He is going
to be completely shocked. If this happens,
this will feel so... good. Okay. -It's going to happen.
-Okay. Yeah. This is one of the best feelings
 in the world. Rome is the vote. He's going to have no clue.
 I'm so happy. (laughing) At tonight's Tribal, Rome will burn. ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Kia.

I do kind of trust the people I'm working with,
but, like, you guys do have to understand,
like, I'm going, -and neither of you are going.
-Understood. TEENY:
 Neither of them are budging. My next Tribal Council is-is... is now. You know,
I don't have much time to waste. Like, you guys
at least have some time. I don't want to lose my vote. -I think... I'm sorry.

 it could work without my vote. All right, guys. ANDY:

 And in that moment, I felt I'm losing my vote either way. I either get something
out of it, or I don't. -Okay, I get it.

-TEENY: They can only be used -when all players are

-Oh, okay. -No.
-Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Me and Genevieve
are voting Rome. KISHAN:
Yeah. TEENY:
 I definitely feel powerless
 without a vote. But I feel really lucky
to have found alliance partners who are coming up with plans
without me even being there, especially
 with my number one Kishan. I'm proud of you guys
for coming up with this... That was all Kish.
I just, like, sat here and got told the plan.
It was amazing. -Just, are you telling Sol?
-We told Sol. -You did?
-He is totally game. -So I can tell Sol, too?
-Yes. -Like, you're in.
-Yeah. -You're fully in.
-Yeah. -And I'm so happy.
-Me, too. TEENY:
 Sol is somebody
 who I want to keep. And if that means
 that we get out Rome, who is a bit of a nuisance
 around camp, who stresses us out
 in the game a little bit, then great.
It's a win-win. The plan was,
that me and Kishan came up with, was to tell Sol
that we're voting for Genevieve. Interesting.
And whose suggestion was -to throw Genevieve's name out?
-Uh, Kishan. But I get why you wouldn't...
wouldn't like that, obviously. -Yes. Yeah.
-Nobody likes
their name being... being the, you know, the decoy,
but obviously we, like... -100%. 100%.
-Yeah, we're good to go. So it wasn't, like,
a malice thing -that Kishan threw your name
out there.
-No. -Of course not.
-Like, I promise. Does Genevieve sound believable? I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos. What about Genevieve? You know,
 strength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve? Once Rome's gone, that leaves Genevieve
in a really vulnerable position. GENEVIEVE:
 Rome going home
 is Kishan's plan. And I am a bossy, type A woman, and I don't want to just
 be going along with plans, especially if they're not
in my best interests. Like, Rome is an asset
for me in this game. And he's ruffling
people's feathers, but not mine. He trusts me.
 He will have my back. I mean, as much
 as anyone out here will. And the biggest red flag
 for me is, Kishan doesn't hesitate to use
 my name as the decoy vote, which lets me know he's not really intimidated
 or respecting my game. So maybe it's time to stop going along
with Kishan's plan and make Kishan the plan. -What's up?
-I need to give you a heads-up, -and I need to make it quick.
-Okay. You're the plan tonight. I'm 100% serious. -So, does Teeny
know about this?
-Everyone knows about it. All these brilliant plans
are his. What do you want to do? ROME:
 That's just so wild that Kishan would
 throw that out there. Why would they want me out if they know I'm going hard
for the alliance? That's just so... The second
 that I heard Kishan might want to put my name out there,
I was a little bit hurt because I wanted to do everything
that I could to make the alliance
as strong as possible. And now, at this point, I don't feel like I can trust anyone in this game
 but Genevieve. Does Sol know about it? ROME:
 My Steal a Vote
 could be massive tonight. Maybe we could
 just get out Kishan. Or I could block him completely
 from being able to vote and put two votes on Sol. And just like that,
 Sol will be going home. I'm willing to do it
 because guess what. I already know
 the guy doesn't like me. This, uh, uh, crazy, toxic, brother-like relationship
 is a huge problem long-term. -He put Rome up to it.
-Uh-huh. And everyone is benefiting
from you two fighting. Uh-huh. There's no way
I'm not voting Rome tonight. Let's just stick... Can we
please just stick to the plan? GENEVIEVE:
 There is no way I can pull off
 a Kishan blindside without Rome and Sol,
but they're openly adversaries. And then
 Teeny doesn't have a vote, and she's really close
 with Kishan. So that's really not an option
 to me. -I know.
-Like, why? -'Cause Genevieve loves us.
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 But Rome and Sol have now
 just had this big fight, almost to the point
that it's irreparable damage that can't be undone. So it is going to take a miracle to get them to work together. There's just no, no, no way. ROME:
Sol, I just want to say that, like, I know that I
probably came across way wrong, and, like, I just want you
to know that I'm... I apologize
if I came off threatening or whatever, you know,
you may think. SOL:
All right, I appreciate that. -Okay. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a game. -We need to get control.
-Right, but... -We're not gonna have it.
-...after, after... -We're not gonna have it.
-Yes, we will. I... We're not gonna have it. Could be
a million-dollar decision. Sol's like, ""I don't want
 to work with Rome."" Rome's like, ""It's a done deal. Sol is going home tonight."" And what would be best
 for my game would be to take a stealth shot at Kishan
that he wouldn't see coming. Is it bad that I'm excited? It's gonna be a wild night. The problem is, you have to be in the majority,
 you need numbers. It is not a one-person game.
Genevieve doesn't get to pick. But with so few votes, and because the Steal a Vote
 advantage exists, anything could happen, and it wouldn't take too much to turn the tide. Wa nt t o ge t th e mo st o ut of o ne s he et ? Grab Bounty. (♪♪) Bounty is made

All right. So let's start by talking
about today's challenge. Rome, I've never really seen
anything like today in the sense that you got to the puzzle
first and never got a single piece,
not one piece of the puzzle. ROME:
You know, we did great in the first part
of the challenge today. We were the first ones to get
to the puzzle, so I stepped up. I wanted to, you know,
try my hand at it. And, unfortunately,
I failed pretty miserably. PROBST:
I was surprised that you never wanted
a different perspective, like to step back
or to look at it this way. You just kept,
like a doctor taking the... Maybe Kishan can give
a better analogy, but... -(laughter)
-Scalpel. PROBST:
Like the scalpel, yeah. ROME:
Well, I don't even know if doing it differently
would have changed anything, in all honesty.
I truly feel like we're just not that great at those specific
type of puzzles. PROBST:
Okay, so you lost,
you're back here at Tribal. So, Sol, if I dropped in
on Camp Lavo this afternoon, what would I notice happening? Chaos times ten is what
you would have walked into. -Wow.
-Yeah. Look, after the challenge,
Rome announces to me that he has a Steal a Vote, which shocked the hell
out of me. And he basically said, ""Since you're on the bottom,
you and I can work together. ""Uh, the only way
I'll do that, though, is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark."" ROME:
Listen, it's not like he didn't write my name down last Tribal Council. He did. So I told him, ""The only way
that I would trust you ""to work with you is if you
give me your Shot in the Dark. ""But if you don't, ""then I'm gonna use
my Steal a Vote on you, ""and you're not gonna be able
to play your Shot in the Dark, and you're gonna
be going home tonight."" Sol, given the fact
that you did vote for Rome, that's not
that unusual a request. SOL:
It's kind of smart, but at the same time, for me,
the way he went about it, that's the key.
I didn't appreciate it, and so I said,
""Are you threatening me, dude?"" -Uh, what did you say?
-I said, ""No. -it's an ultimatum,
not a threat.""
-Right. And so, for me, it sounds
like a threat, so I said, ""No, I'm not doing it."" PROBST:
And, Rome, your threat about -stealing his vote is...
-Ultimatum, Jeff. -(laughter)
-The ultimatum about stealing his vote is
that you have to have a vote in order
to play the Shot in the Dark. ROME:
Precisely. And I just want to say, Jeff, I, in the moment, thought that that was
the right thing to do, but the way that I did it and
the way that I approached Sol was just not respectful. Everyone that knows me
in real life knows I'm a super genuine person. So I went to him today,
and I apologized, and I think
that he does understand that that's...
that's just not who I am. PROBST:
Kishan,
what's your take on this? Because
when there's only five of you, it doesn't take much
to vote somebody out. An argument can do it. You know, we're spending
24 hours a day with each other. I think

that bother you, that irk you. But I think if you let
an argument guide your vote, that's letting emotions get
to you. I think
when you're playing this game, you have to be more strategic
than that. -PROBST: Teeny,
how about for you?
-From my vantage point as somebody who wasn't involved
in the fight and also from my vantage point
as someone who did lose their vote
on a journey today, all I could really do
is put trust in the people that I had
worked with last Tribal Council and hope that it goes well. PROBST:
Genevieve,
what do you make about this? Because it sounds like there could be two people
that aren't voting. Teeny lost her vote, Rome is threatening
to steal somebody else's vote. That means
it could be four total votes, but just three people. Yeah. It means... those three people
have a lot of power. And you better hope those three
people are working with you and have your back, because they're gonna rule the day
today. KISHAN:
Jeff, I don't think at the end of the day
it changes much because it comes down to trust. You trust the conversations
you had. You trust a plan
that you've set forward. It doesn't matter
because you trust -what the plan is in place.
-PROBST: So, Sol, that can't make you feel great. Nope. Not great at all, and, um, I'm just begging Rome, bro, maybe not steal my vote? I do have
my Shot in the Dark here. If my vote is not gone,
I am playing it. PROBST:
And, Rome, what's interesting
about this is, that's a real person... -Yeah.
-I am a very real person... -PROBST: ...saying to you...
-...in the flesh behind you. -Yeah.
-...that, ""I'm already
in trouble, I think. And now you're taking
the only protection I have,"" which is the only move to make
if you want to take out Sol. But Sol's pleading with you, ""Give me a shot."" ROME:
At the end of the day,
it's going to be my decision whether or not I, uh, I take this guy's vote
or not, and, you know, I just got to trust
the people that I trust, and the people that I don't
trust, I'm not gonna trust you, and I'm going
to do everything I can to get you out of this game. Wow. Ooh. (laughs) -Spooky, scary, right?
-Yeah. Is that the kind of laugh
you give when you're watching Survivor at home, Genevieve? When I'm watching Tribal, and it gets like this,
and you're like, ""Oh, my God. Ooh,
something's happening."" Like... So from all this chaos, where do you sit right now as
we are moments away from voting? So, chaos times ten can be great
as long as you're not in it. But honestly,
if I'm wrong tonight, it's over for me. So I think that this vote is critical to the future success
of my game. ♪ ♪ All right, it is time to vote. ROME:
You know, Jeff, I, uh... I trust the people
that I trust, like I said, and I don't trust the people
that I don't trust. So I got a Steal a Vote, and I'm gonna be stealing
Kishan's vote tonight. PROBST:
All right,
this is a Steal a Vote. Rome, you are
taking Kishan's vote, which means, Kishan,
you will not vote tonight. Rome, when you go up,
you will vote twice. All right, it is time to vote.
Genevieve, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'm absolutely freaking out. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol, and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote-- Kishan. Kishan.
That's two votes-- Kishan. Fourth person voted out
of Survivor 47-- Kishan. That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. TEENY:
I love you, Kishan. KISHAN:
I love you. You guys are amazing.
Good game. Good game. Kishan, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Good luck, y'alls. -Thank you, man.

 Genevieve telling Rachel that she's dragging me is laughable. I've been playing a game
 that no one is seeing. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being underestimated
 in this game. -Kyle?
-Yes.
-But we have to get him first. SUE:
 I knew his day would come, and I've been drooling...

of our jury: Kyle. The tribe has spoken. SUE: I'm hoping that this thing
will last through the night, so, we'll push these down
a little bit more. TEENY:
You know, Kyle
was definitely a big part of the fabric of season 47. SUE: Tonight, I am
 on top of the world, because Kyle is now gone. It was always
just about his story. -Right.
-It was, like, the Kyle show. It was too annoying
and I couldn't let it go. The longer he was here,
 the more annoying he became. He walked around
 calling Caroline and I ""Tweedleydee and Tweedleydum."" And tonight, we got sweet,
 sweet, sweet revenge. I was, like, dead set
on having him gone. SUE:
He was taking away
our opportunity and slowly just picking off,
one by one, all of us, right?
Because he was winning. (laughing) SAM: Having Kyle was a really, really useful shield, but there's really nothing
I could have done. I was kind of powerless tonight, because there is a posse of five players: Andy, Teeny, Rachel, Sue and Caroline, picking off the big threats

 and messy and crazy, but I could not think of a better alliance
to go to the end with. Yesterday, I was, like, discounting your game. That was so, like,
stupid and unfair of me, and, like, I hope we can still
be friends after this, -that'll you'll forgive me,

comes perception of other people's games,
and it's all fair. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
to make it uncomfortable -with you guys.
-It's okay. GENEVIEVE:
 I've sort of been
 branded as someone who is just calculated
 and strategic and doesn't really
 care about people. And in this game,
if everyone is afraid that I'm too big, too much, I think the best thing
for my game is to shrink. Game-wise, we've had...
we've had an interesting relationship, and
I just think it's kind of fun. I think what's also fun is that
we're both still in it. (laughs) (laughs)
Well, I think you'll
be in it for a long time. (laughing): I think I'm... I'm, uh, in it for now. I would love to be, like,
the big, bad wolf, still, but that is going to end my time quicker than playing possum. And at this point,
I will play possum. I will play sad puppy dog
with tail between its legs. I'll play giraffe,
elephant, whatever I need to play to stay in this game
 a little longer. I'm really not that dangerous,
 you know. You've-you've taken off my claws and teeth, and now I'm just a house cat. There are folks on this beach that are the bigger threat
 than I am right now. Look where we've ended up,
Genevieve. From the insane asylum of Lavo, all the way to Beka Beach,
where bad things happen. I do think if Rachel goes out, everyone's chances
of winning get better. -I hear you.
-Like, I think everybody actually
likes her the most. She's playing the game
that I wish I played. It is, like, very calculated,
organized and controlled. You think that's what
the jury's thinking, is Rachel is the biggest threat
right now? Rachel has been, like,
tactical about everything, like, flawlessly. Like... I'm not a slam dunk for you
if Rachel is there. -That's what I'm saying.
-Sounds like a threat. I say it's not
a slam dunk for you and then you come back
and tell me that's a threat? She doesn't think
I can beat Rachel. Okay, that was
a ... th And I'm insulted by her words. You definitely
use emotions as a weapon. TEENY:
 Genevieve is desperate,
 trying to cause some chaos, and I'm not falling
 into that trap because Sam and Genevieve
 are both on the bottom. They're people
 who have hurt me in the past, they're people
who bothered me in this game. I'm just giving you my opinion,
'cause you asked. All right. At this point
 in our coalition of underdogs, we're sick of Genevieve and Sam. We're scared
of Genevieve and Sam. Ugh. TEENY:
 One of them is going home, and there's nothing
 they can do about it. So awkward. Oh, my God. I hate that they're almost,

very outwardly joking -about how they know

uncomfortable. -Yes.

 I found out this morning that Sam and Genevieve are actively trying to target me and giving all these reasons
why I'm going to win. It is scary,
 but I also feel pretty secure in the people
 that I have my trust in. I think that, no matter how
 scary they make me out to be, they're always going
to be more scary than me. RACHEL: But also, I do have this idol that nobody knows

 For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race through a series of obstacles and retrieve a ball

 a second ball and crawl
 under a net to the finish, where you will attempt
 to land both balls on a two-level perch. First player

-(all voicing assent) We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go. -Wow.
-Sanctuary awaits. Sure. PROBST:
All right, here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go!
First you got to get rid of all those sandbags. Three of them are easy.
Push 'em over. Three of them are tied up. PROBST:
You're gonna have
to quickly untie those knots. Then you go over
the same way the bags go over. Just keep ripping
through that rope. Launch those sandbags
and toss yourself over, and you're on to the next stage. Rachel, you're good. Rachel's over first. Rachel in the lead.
There's Sam right behind. Got to move that ball
through the net tunnel. Here comes Andy. -Ooh!
-PROBST: There's Genevieve. Here comes Caroline. (groans)
Ooh. PROBST:
There goes Teeny.
Here comes Sue. Everybody now in the net tunnel. You can go from the side, you can go from the top,
you can go from the bottom. You just want to move that ball. Rachel still in the lead,
moving quickly through this second stage. And it's Sam and Genevieve on the end. Everybody else trying
to catch up. Rachel close. She's got it.
Rachel still in the lead. Rachel now gonna
untie that second ball. -Genevieve has it!
-Aah! Here comes Andy now. Sam's at the very end. Got to knock it through, Sam. Rachel has her second ball. She's working through
the net crawl with both balls. Sam's in it now. Got four people in the third
stage of this challenge. -SAM: Let's go.
-Rachel still in the lead. GENEVIEVE:
Good job, Sam. You got this. Let's go, man.
Let's go, man. Genevieve has her second ball. Teeny through the net tunnel. She's at the third stage now. Genevieve working
to catch Rachel. Here goes Sam.
Quickly got his second ball. Sam now ripping
through this net. Sam is making up a ton of time. Sam is gonna catch Rachel. PROBST:
And Sam comes out
ahead of Rachel now. It's Sam and Rachel at the final stage
of this challenge. Here comes Andy. On the end is Genevieve. Caroline, Sue,
still back at the second stage. (grunting) PROBST:
Now you got to land both balls, one on each level of this perch. -(Rachel grunts)
-PROBST: Andy's through now. He's in on it. Sam lands his first ball. Sam can win it with this toss. On and off. Here comes Teeny. She's in.
Genevieve's in on it now. (sighs) Rachel with a toss. Andy trying to land his first. It is Sam in the lead. Would be a nice victory
for Sam today. An afternoon at the sanctuary. Rachel lands her first ball.
We are tied. It is Rachel and Sam
both now working on that second and final ball.
Sam on and off. Rachel could win it. No, just short. -Sam is on
-Aah! and off again. Rachel could win it. On and off. -Yes!
-PROBST: Sam does it! -It's over.
-TEENY: Oh, my God. Sam wins reward, -GENEVIEVE: Good job, Sam.
an afternoon at the sanctuary for pizza and pasta. -Amazing.
-PROBST: Wow. Fun finish. No problem, man. (Rachel sighs) Sam, come on over. -Good job, Sam.
-Good job. PROBST:
Well done. So, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna
go to the sanctuary. Nice afternoon. Pizza, pasta. When the afternoon ends, you'll have a pillow,
you'll have a blanket, -'cause you're gonna
spend the night.
-Oh. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Get what might be your only good night's sleep out here. This is the fuel you need for these last six days. And to make it
a little more enjoyable and a lot more complicated, you will also have
your letters from home. What? PROBST:
You're gonna have
a little reminder of why you are out here. So now, big decision. -Yeah.
-Choose one person to join you. Yeah. Um, the problem with
being in this position, as happy as I am for myself, there's people that I have to
take that opportunity away from, and that's difficult to stomach. Nobody wants to miss out
on the letters, Jeff. (Sue sniffles) So, the letters are arguably -more valuable than the food.
-It's more important... it's
more important than the food for most of the people here,
I think. -I...
-Genevieve, agree with that? -Yeah.
-PROBST: You can't even talk. -Sue, what's going on with you?
-(sighs) I understand he has
a really tough decision to make, and I know every single one
of us has the exact same reason of why we want
our letters from home. So, it's gonna be hard, you know, for anybody
who doesn't get those letters. Um... there's one person here
that I promised I would take on a reward
no matter what. I think they're the most
deserving person over there. So I'm gonna go with Andy. -Good job, Andy.
-PROBST: Andy. Andy, you look surprised. Come on over. Thanks, man. Andy, why so shocked, given that Sam's already
told you he would take you? I'm the last person I expected to be picked for this reward,
to be honest. I'm...
Game-wise, we're up and down, and I don't think we're on the
best terms currently, game-wise. I-I do what I say I'm gonna do. -Yeah.
-And I told Andy I would
take him, so... I take him. PROBST:
All right, Sam, you have
one more choice. That's it. So three of you are gonna
be at the sanctuary. Four players
will be back at camp with nothing but some rice. Tell me who your
final choice is and why. I don't think it would be right for me to eat Italian food
without Genevieve, -so I'm gonna pick Genevieve.
-PROBST: Genevieve, come on over. Thanks, man. PROBST:
All right, here's
what's gonna happen. Sam, Genevieve, Andy, you're gonna leave here,
enjoy the nice afternoon. You'll spend the night. You'll
return to camp in the morning. Grab your stuff, head out. -I'm sorry, guys. Sorry.
-You're gonna slam some pasta. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Well done. You earned it. -Enjoy.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff. (sniffles) All right, they're gone. So, what impact does this have,
game-wise, if any? 'Cause this is always
a big turning point. Teeny. I mean, Genevieve and Sam
have already made themselves
a very clear duo in that they're both the targets
and the threats in this game. And as far as I see it, relying on me
to try and pull me in -to get one
of the remaining people out.
-Right. So, leaving me here
and not choosing me-- it-it definitely
pushes me one way. And so, I think it was a bit of a foolish decision
for Sam to pick her. I think it's actually going to have a horrible outcome
for their game. -Yeah.
-PROBST: All right, Caroline, Rachel, Teeny, Sue,
got nothing for you. -Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
-Thank you. -Hope they enjoy
the last supper.
-(chuckles) Yeah.
We're eating all the rice. RACHEL:
 Loved ones letters is always contentious. People get pissed.
It's like choosing bridesmaids. Like, you just don't
want to do it. And so, as hard as it was
 to lose that challenge, Sam doing this and just, like, pissing off so many people is a pretty good thing
for my game and my alliance. It's going to make us tighter. I wa s st uc k. Unresolved depression

at camp aren't mad at me. -Mm-mmm.
-ANDY: No. SAM:
Dude, Andy, you've been through 21 days of this game
with a lot of really low lows. You've kept a smile
through all of it. I have so much respect for that. And early in the game, I was not the friend or ally
to you that I needed to be, and so,
I want to make up for that. -ANDY: I'm speechless right now.
-Yeah. -So...
-Dude, it means everything. SAM:
Yeah, man. There are probably
 four people at camp that are not
 thrilled with me right now, but I knew I was
 gonna choose Andy before the challenge
 even started because I feel like
I do owe Andy a little bit. GENEVIEVE:
Oh, my God, this is basil. SAM:
 And Genevieve and I
 have felt like we are on the bottom. So, giving her
 the emotional support of letters from home-- easy no-brainer. This is, like, insane, like, timing for this day. Like, Sam, you don't
know this yet, but I talked to Andy this morning,
it got a little intense, and now I'm, like,
the happiest I've been. SAM:
Can I ask you something? -GENEVIEVE Okay.
-SAM: I'm-I'm just curious to your non-emotional approach. Like, where do you think
that comes from? I wasn't planning
to be closed off and detached, but Kishan was, like, one of my first friends here. -Yeah.
-And when we voted him out, his, like, last words were, -""I trusted you.""
-SAM: Hmm. Like, very, very sincerely
and very sadly. And I just kind of,
at that point, was like, ""I don't want to get
emotionally close to people ""or, like,
let them get close to me, knowing I'm going
to vote them out."" And I kind of regret that. Like, you know, it's-it's hard
to hurt people, but then you miss out on
all of the connection and, like, I wish
I learned that day one instead of day 21, but... You learn by going through it, -by having these experiences.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. -SAM: Better late
than never, though.
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 This girl has learned keeping everybody at arm's
 length makes it easier to vote them out,
but it makes it easier for them to vote you out, too. And so, what I need to focus on now is to let everyone in
 a little bit... SAM:
The letters. -I'm ready.
-Yours are heavy. GENEVIEVE:
 ...even though it's awkward and uncomfortable
and vulnerable and I hate it. My dad was telling me,
 ""You can do this. ""We love you,
 and I'm sure you have so many friends."" (sniffles) And I have no friends out here. And it's my fault.
Like, I chose... I chose to have no friends. Who does that?
(sniffles) Who does that? (laughs softly) But my husband says,
 ""If you have a bad day, ""try to slow down. ""Remember that mistakes can be fixed,
especially in Survivor."" (laughs) ""No matter
 what happens out there, you are coming home to the same
 amazing life you left."" (crying) SAM:
 My brother wrote,
 ""I know some days ""you probably want
to get on a plane and fly home, ""but I want you to know ""that I'm proud of you. ""I've always admired
your sense of adventure ""and your willingness
to do something scary because it might be fun."" (exhales sharply) It gives me a lot of confidence in who I am as a person, and it's what
 I needed to remind myself. My loyalty is to the people
writing these letters. ANDY:
 My mom is an absolute
 superfan of this game. When she first learned
that I might be going out here, it became, like,
 the light of her life. This is the proudest
 she's ever been. It's so meaningful
to hear from her right now. This game is intense.
 I've had tough times. Nothing's been perfect. It hasn't been easy,
 but I persevered. It's been
 completely life-changing, and these letters
 are exactly what I needed. There's less than a week left
to go, right? And my decisions will dictate
 what my fate is and, dare I say, my Survivor legacy. All I have to do is just go all frigging out until the very,
very, very bitter end. I'm more than fueled
 for the rest of this game. I honestly feel like
I should give myself a second -before I say things
I'm gonna regret.
-Yeah. Okay. But I also couldn't think
of the three better people -to sit here and dissect
-Yeah. every inch of why that was the dumbest thing
Sam could have done. -He's really not playing.
-Sam just quit the game. -He's not smart at all.
-TEENY: In my opinion, Sam just quit the game.
Sam just decided that he was going
to have his last meal with his best friend
and enjoy a last supper. -I agree.
-TEENY: And there we go. It's so idiotic to me. You'd think just maybe,
just maybe, he would try a Hail Mary, to pick me,
somebody he could pull over. But you know what, guys?
He's a stand-up guy. -SUE: Oh, yeah. Go, Sam!
-He's a hero! Most generous man I've ever met. Sam wants to be the hero. (whoops) He is just this honorable, strong, just smart guy. So he picks the only other guy
 out here-- Andy, his boy. Sam thinks him and Genevieve
are gonna talk to Andy, get him a little red-wine drunk,
and that they're gonna convince -Andy to flip on this...
-And me. And that they're going...
Yeah, on you. -RACHEL: I'm not worried.
-TEENY: Oh, he's not gonna flip. -SUE: You don't think so?
-TEENY: If he does again, -they still need another person.
-CAROLINE: Doesn't matter. We just have to worry about
any advantage that they get. -Sam just has to go, period.
-Yeah. -TEENY: And...
-RACHEL: Yeah.
-Bam. TEENY:
 It just feels like
 Sam is checking every box on Teeny's list of why he needs
to be the one to go home in both personal
and strategic ways. -Am I just, like,
a man-hater at my core? Like...
-SUE: No. I think he's just always been,
like, popular, the class clown, like... -And that... (grunting)
-SUE: Yeah, he was probably prom king. TEENY:
 Having somebody who's, like, your typical, all-American, quarterback-looking guy around all the time--
it's just not... it's just not my thing. Sam's gonna come back
and be like, ""Ah, it was good. ""Like, we had pasta, ""and you know, like,
I'm sorry, guys. ""It was a really rough spot
to be in. ""I hope you get it. Like,
me and Genevieve are just, like, on the bottom together
and, like..."" -He'll be crying, too.
He'll be crying.
-""I just, you know, the Italian, she'd be talking
about that chicken parm, and..."" I'm also jealous.
 I want to be there. I'm not gonna lie about that.
I want the food, I want the loved-one letter. But Sam left
 the four of us girls here to basically plan his demise, which will be coming imminently, and will be something
I take great joy in. -Me too.
-Me too. Me too. I mean, I am obsessed
with the idea of all women. -SUE: Me too.
-CAROLINE: I would be proud -to sit by all four of you,
and I also think -Same.
-all four of us, I think,
have a genuinely, like, pretty good shot
against each other, -in the best way possible.
-TEENY: Yeah. Me too. -In a positive way.
-It would be, in a positive way. I would be proud
to end my Survivor journey -side by side by any of you.
-SUE: Yeah.
-TEENY: Me too. I would have zero regrets. Me too. And I would be happy
if any of you won. CAROLINE: I'm liking this four
 a lot, so I'm hoping to use some, like,
morale, kumbaya, ""We're four final women,
we got this, let's go."" We're gonna vote out Sam first,
and it's gonna be glorious. TEENY:
That smug face. I just can't.
I can't, I can't, I can't. CAROLINE:
 We are gonna be
 the final four women. So, we're really solidifying how is it we're gonna
 get rid of Sam, then how are we gonna get rid
of Genevieve, and then how are we gonna
get rid of Andy. -SUE: One, two, three.
-Oh. Got it. -Nice.
-RACHEL: Oh, my. Balance a sec. We got it. This is the four
 who are going to run this show to the very friggin' end. -Um, girl power!
-(whooping) Girl power. CAROLINE:
 I'll be honest. I can see the million dollars. I can see the Final Tribal.
I can see my pitch. I can see myself
winning this game, and it's intoxicating,
 and it's so exciting. -Good job, guys.

Regardless, I woke up this morning
with a plan. I like day 21 plans, Andy. Me too. Me too. This is an opportunity
that we cannot pass up. What I want this to be
is the defining conversation and night
for the rest of this game. GENEVIEVE: I don't conduct
much business in beanbag chairs, but Andy calls a meeting
 and, like, the last couple days,
I have been on this slow march to death in this game. I'm all ears. Talk to me, Andy.
What is your plan? I'm coming over to you. But here's what's working
against us. There is a five-person alliance
called the underdog alliance, and I've been voting with them. It's highly unrealistic
we pull any of them. Oh, really? You think so? ANDY:
There is no...
There is no chance. So what we have in our favor is that we have the time
and space tonight to come up
with a pretty elaborate plan. The goal is build suspicion
that one of you has an idol. If we do that, they will
be compelled to split the vote. Then all I have to do is swing
my vote over to you guys and we take out Rachel. Obviously,
she's a big threat, right? She also has an advantage.
She has a Block a Vote. Does everybody know that
except us? -ANDY: Yeah. Yeah.
-Wow. Andy is my hero. This is what Genevieve and I
have been waiting for. It's time to get the band back together
 to take out Rachel. I'm going all out,
and I have no fear. This is really
our only chance of winning, is getting together right now. It really is high time
for me to go for broke. The way I started this game
 built an initial perception that I was a goat. This is my opportunity
 to make my mark and finish this game off in a
way where I can get first place. Do you think they're gonna be
suspicious when you come back -to camp?
-Yeah. We have to come up
with a whole fake story. We have to milk the time
 that we have on the sanctuary to put together
 a very difficult mission. This is not simple. It's going to require
 thorough planning, a lot of stealth and just pure execution. Yeah. ANDY: This is the biggest heist
 of season 47 of Survivor, and we're calling it
""Operation Italy."" -SUE: Hello.
-SAM: Hello. -Hello, hello.
-Hi. Long time no see, people. Step one of Operation Italy is to channel all
of my theater experience. I'm obviously sorry
about that yesterday. It was a hard spot. -SAM: Yeah.
-TEENY: Yeah.
Don't worry about it. SAM:
 I'm laying it on thick.
 I'm apologizing. I'm kind of going
 right back to the playing-dead Sam that I was before this plan. And I'll do anything to live
 another day in this game. I would rather do Rachel,
but if I have to do Genevieve, I will do Genevieve
to stay in the game. -And I am... and I am... I...
-Like, I'm not... Looking pretty dire for me. Still kind of a free agent,
um, out here. I don't know
how you see things now, but, you know,
I'm trying to just survive. If this works, there's gonna
 have to be a couple Oscars handed out
to Genevieve, Andy and myself. It's gonna take that level
of performance to, like,
 really nail this thing down. But I'm feeling
 pretty confident. GENEVIEVE:
 Operation Italy depends on a split vote, and the only reason
people would split a vote is if they're worried
you have something. At the sanctuary,
 Sam gave me his original idol from Gata, which is expired. He also gave me two bracelets
 from tree mail that I'm going to craft together
to try and make an idol. I love this plan,
 but for Operation Italy to have any hope,
 everybody's story has to paint a picture
for the broader group, and it has to all seem
 like it's making sense... This could work.
This could work. ...until the moment
people realize it doesn't. And that moment has to be
when the votes are read. I have made a Beka merge idol. I'm sorry. We were... We all felt bad
for you, honestly. Everything but the let... Yeah. ANDY:
 My role for Operation Italy is to reingratiate myself with
my underdog alliance of five because I had been away for a really long time. It was bad energy
because they pitched me hard. Yeah.
We knew they were gonna. ANDY:
 I need them to feel that I am still trustworthy and that I am still
a number for them. I don't like
how they approached me because it just felt like they brought me to wine
and dine me and try to, like, -Mm-hmm.
-be a vote for them. It just felt, like,
really premeditated. Like, they brought me
to wine and dine me. I could just tell
that they just picked me -to wine and dine me,
that, like...
-Of course. They're saying, like,
""You just have to come with us."" -Yeah.
-It's very strong-armed. And it was just not
the right approach for me, because it was, like,
strong-arming me. Well, I'm all set.
I'm right where you left me. ANDY:
 Step number two: foster suspicion that Genevieve has
a hidden immunity idol. I'm most afraid of the idol. I'm most afraid
of the idol. Do you know if they got any kind
of advantage? -They did, didn't they?
-It's hard to say. -SUE: Oh, shoot. Okay.
-I don't know. This fake information that Genevieve has
 a hidden immunity idol is going to cause
paranoia, insecurity, and that will help me
 convince my alliance to split the vote. Teeny and Rachel were kind
of preferring for Sam to go out first. -How do you feel about that?
-I'm down for it, but -I'm most afraid
of the idol, so, I...
-Yeah. If you... if we were to decide that we put more on Genevieve, then we can guarantee
we're flushing it. -But anyway... Sorry. Go ahead.
-Oh. Oh. We were thinking... Oh. So, um, instead,
prioritize Genevieve? Yeah, because then, we can get
that idol out tonight -no matter what.
-I'll be honest. The idol
scares me the most, too. So then, we would need to then -split the vote to make sure.
-ANDY: Yeah. Yeah. It's the best play-- splitting
a vote to account for an idol. Operation Italy
 has been executed to perfection. My underdog...
(blows raspberries) ...underdog alliance of five
has no idea what I'm cooking. It's really smart. CAROLINE: Thank you, Andy. It's time to strike.
 It's time to pull the trigger on the juiciest target

Should we get into it? -(all voicing assent)
-All right, first things first. Rachel, got
to take back the necklace. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Thank you. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge
will require a combination of balance, dexterity and touch.
Here's how it works. First, you must navigate
 a balance beam while transporting
 a ball on a pole. Once you're done with that,
 you must then quickly maneuver two skulls
 through a metal maze. Once you've completed that,
 you'll move to the finish, where you will need touch as you roll balls
 along a paddle, attempting to land three of them in any of the five targets. First person to accomplish all of that earns this. The immunity necklace.
Safe tonight at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot
in the final six. Losers, Tribal Council
where somebody will be twelfth person voted out
and become the fifth member of our jury. -Shall we get to it? All right.
-(all voicing assent) We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go.
For immunity and a spot in the final six. Survivors ready? Go! First stage is about balance. You've got a balance beam and you have a ball on a pole. It's gonna want to drop off
like it just did for Rachel. -Oop!
-PROBST: Genevieve drops. She's got to go back. Teeny out to a fast start. Sam on the course,
Rachel back out. Everybody now doing it. Teeny's first across.
You're good. Drop it and move on. Here comes Sam.
Sam's across. You're good. Rachel's across. You're good. Caroline drops.
She's got to go back. Teeny, Sam, Rachel all have their double-ended
warrior staff. They're maneuvering skulls
through a metal maze. This is tougher than it looks. Teeny now struggling
in this second stage. Sam moving quickly through. Andy's across the beam. He's trying to get back in this. Every single second's
gonna count when you get
to that final stage. You got to get
through those beams. Let's go! Andy's now in it. Rachel doing a nice job. Sam and Rachel pulling ahead. Andy's starting
to gain some ground now. Sam's gonna be out first. Sam, you're good! Sam is moving on
to the final stage. This is where it is won or lost
with your ability to navigate that little ball down your paddle
into a tiny dimple. Sam trying to stick his first. He can't do it. There goes Rachel. It is Rachel and Sam. Teeny has hers. Let's go, Teeny!
She's through. You just need three balls in any of the five spots. This is all about touch. The question is who's gonna
figure out the touch first? There's definitely
a learning curve, but once you learn it,
this can go quickly. You've got to get it to stick
in one of those little dimples. It doesn't matter which one. Rachel has her first. Sam's still trying
to get it to stick. He's all around it. Teeny having no luck. Andy now gonna
be in on the paddle. Can he make up some time? Sue trying to get in on it. Here comes Genevieve. PROBST:
Immunity on the line. Sue's good! Sue, you're in this. Here comes Genevieve. These paddles are heavy. The weight is not
distributed evenly. This is gonna be hard. Okay. PROBST:
Rachel, another ball out. This is her second. Very close. Can she get
that second ball to stick? And she does. It is Rachel in the lead
with two. One ball left. Nobody else has anything. Andy drops, got to start again. -Teeny struggling.
-Oh, my God. PROBST:
Sam still trying
to get his first. Nobody else having any luck
right now. Aah! Hey. Oh. PROBST: Rachel now one ball away
from winning her second individual immunity and
guaranteeing herself a spot in the final six. She's in, she's out. And she's in! It's over! Rachel wins individual immunity, guaranteed a spot -in the final six.
-Damn. -PROBST: Wow, that was fast.
-SUE: Good job, Rachel. -GENEVIEVE: Good job, Rachel.
-CAROLINE: Wow. -PROBST:
Rachel, come on over.
-(whooping) Going right back on. Thanks again, Jeff. Once again, safe tonight at Tribal Council, cannot be voted out
of this game. You will have a spot
in the final six. As you inch closer
to that final four, -where you know
nobody can take you out,
-RACHEL: Yeah. what is the feeling?
You're that much closer. It's crazy, you know?
I mean, I had a really rough entry
into the merge, and so, to be standing here with the immunity idol again-- I feel amazing.
Like, this is wild, and -I'm excited.
-PROBST: Here's what we know. You are safe.
For everybody else, somebody's dream of Survivor 47
will come to an end, twelfth person voted out,
fifth member of our jury. Grab your stuff. Head back to
camp. See you tonight of Tribal. -Congrats.
-Thanks, Jeff. ANDY:
 Rachel-- she wins a challenge, she dominates,
 and now she has immunity. And... that's a setback. It's a setback for Operation Italy
 'cause she was the target. She was the hit.
Now that Rachel's off the table, the real big question is
 who is the new target? Th er e he i s. Wherever I go they always
 ask “Where's Waldo?” Ah, you found me. Never “Who's Waldo?” Sometimes it takes someone
 who really knows you to make you feel seen. Gifts that say I get you.

 First thing I want to say, if this is our last
Tribal Council together, it was an absolute pleasure
playing with you. If it's... if it's me going,
fight like hell, get there,
and you got my vote. -Likewise. Likewise.
-If you go,
I'll fight like hell. GENEVIEVE:
 The hit was out on Rachel, and she wins the challenge. Of course. Not great for me. Not great for Operation Italy. But Operation Italy was designed to be flexible. -I would love
to do Caroline instead.
-Yeah. We have to pick
between Caroline and Teeny, -and somehow let Andy know.
-Okay. 'Cause I still
want to do the plan, -basically, as usual.
-Yeah. -Did you do it? Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. But the string
you got was a black string -to make with the beads.
-Oh, this is beautiful. This is b... This is good. Pretty good, I think. And so, my plan with this is to ensure
 there is a vote split tonight because we need the vote split. We need Andy in the majority
 side of the vote so that he can flip,
and that is the recipe to success for Operation Italy. Obviously, this move is, like... Andy is the straw that stirs
the drink in the move, and he plays
the most pivotal part. To final six. I don't think she has an idol. -Really? I think she does.
-I don't think she has it. Yes, I... I don't think
she has it, but, like, -I just want him out.
-Okay. I think she...
I think she has the idol. She... ANDY:
 I still want Operation Italy
 to really succeed tonight. And so, I'm like, ""Here's what we should do.
We should split the vote. ""We should split the vote. Then we should flush out
 Genevieve's idol."" The only hiccup here is that Teeny, Teeny, Teeny
has her own agenda. The thing is... I think it makes more sense
to just, like... It's, like, we get the idol out
100%, and we do it that way. I guess... I guess
your plan's better, but I just don't think she does,
and I think... It's the path of least
resistance in terms of risk. TEENY:
My preference to go home tonight
 is definitely Sam. But we also want to flush this
hypothetical, mysterious idol
that we think Genevieve has. I'm scared, if Genevieve
 doesn't have an idol, and we stack the votes on her, she's gonna walk out the door and Sam's still gonna be here. GENEVIEVE:
As Teeny walks up to Sam and I,
 now I'm nervous, because my fake idol
is not perfect. It's fake, it's counterfeit.
I know that. If she looks too closely,
 she may know that. Why? Keep it on me. If it changes, let me know. Am I... am I gathering
what I think I'm gathering? You're gathering
what you think. -Can I see it?
-Yeah. I need to show it to her
 to have her believe it, but I can't show it
to her too long because then she'll know
it's a fake. GENEVIEVE: Okay. No. I flash this idol
 and then, thank God, Andy's coming around the corner.
I jam it back in my pocket. And so I'm thinking I'm
 in the clear. I've given her, like, just a glimmer,
and that should be good. But I don't think
they think I have anything. Are you sure that's real?
Do you have a note or anything? I buried the note. But, yes, I know it's real because I had
to do the steps this morning. Why do you think I was down
by the freaking water? -Oh.
-Yeah. TEENY:
 When Genevieve shows me
 that she has the idol, I'm relieved in a way, like
it was written in the stars. I already wanted Sam to go. Now I know for a fact that
 Genevieve has an idol, I think I'm gonna sit
on the information. I'm gonna know
Genevieve's safe tonight. I'm going to. I'm going to. TEENY: And now knowing
 that tonight's vote will go exactly how we think it will, it's just... chef's kiss, and I'll see Sam later. -We are 95% there.
-Okay. -Has it?
-And it's... Yeah. -That's perfect.
-Let 'em split... -Which is exactly
what we wanted to, so...
-Okay. -I agree.
-That's what my gut tells me. I'm the mafia boss. I'm the
 architect of Operation Italy. The target has to be Caroline. -So, you want Caroline?
-Yeah. Everything's a go.
It's perfect. Operation Italy is
in a good place right now. She's got her number one: Sue. That little
 loyal, loyal, loyal bond, which makes her powerful
 in this game. And Caroline is the brains
 of that pair, and so, she's got to sleep
with the fishes. All right, beaut....
beautiful, beautiful. Oh, let's go. Operation Italy, baby. I have this optimistic feeling
 in my gut that we're gonna be able
to pull this off. -Uh... (laughs)
-(laughs) SAM:
But the underdog alliance needs to believe
that nothing has changed, and I'm still little old Sam just trying
 to survive another day. I think
Genevieve's voting for you. Mm-hmm. SAM:
I'm down to write
whatever keeps me in the game. RACHEL:
I'm writing down Genevieve. Look at me.
Writing down Genevieve. -SAM: Really?
-Yeah. I know that Genevieve
 is voting for me. It's actually gonna be
 the first time I've seen my name on parchment. And part of me is like, ""Okay. ""This is actually giving
a little bit of validation that I am a threat."" It's reminding the jury
before I do, which is nice. But it's nerve-racking. Yes. Where is it? CAROLINE:
 The biggest concern is
 does Genevieve have an idol. -SUE: I got my eye on 'em. -CAROLINE: I get to go through her bag, but what sucks is I don't think I'm gonna get any definitive answers,
even from that. I didn't see anything in hers. I can't say
I went through it completely, -but, like,
didn't see anything there.
-Okay. CAROLINE:
 Granted, I trust my alliance, but it's just
an unsettling feeling to know that there is a bit of a door open
 for you to go home. So, she's writing my name down. We-we need what's-her-name
to play her Block a Vote then. I just... I mean, if everything -goes according to plan...
-But we need to make it
through tonight. -I'm-I'm afraid so, like...
-Yeah? I'm putting, put...
playing my idol for you. -I mean, I know
it's my neck on the line.
-I'm gonna go with your gut, -but, like,
I want you protected.
-I think it's... Thank you. I mean,
I want to be protected, too. SUE:
 Caroline being voted out is my worst-case scenario.
 I still have my idol. If I get a gut feeling, I'm whipping that thing out and saving Caroline. It's just weird that they're
so relaxed and comfortable. -Yes.
-Like, something's going on. SUE:
 But as long as
 my group all stay strong, we can't go wrong.
We can't go wrong. I think I have different plans about, like, how we want
to approach it tonight. Basically, we want Genevieve
to think it's her so that she plays an idol
if she has it, even though
we're voting Sam out. And we can flip. Basically, I mean,
load up on Sam, and then, one hinky
on Genevieve, probably. RACHEL:
 I'm a little nervous
 about doing the split vote. The biggest concern
 with this alliance of five is just the idea that someone
or... someone could flip. 'Cause I could always block,
too, if I have to. Don't we...
We need your block for six. RACHEL:
 And then also, I could use this Block a Vote
 so that if there is any kind of shenanigans
with an idol, we still get to decide who goes home
 between Sam and Genevieve. Oh, my God,
if this actually works... If this actually works,
I will die. I will die. GENEVIEVE:
 In my heart, I hope it works. In my brain, I mean, how could it? There's so many ways
it could go wrong. Let's run through all the ways
 Operation Italy is a bust. One: the split vote doesn't actually fall the way that
 we think it's gonna fall. Well, I also think,
we don't need to split it because if we tell Genevieve -it's her, she'll play it.
-TEENY: Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 Two: we need the stars
 to align, and Rachel not
 to play her Block a Vote. Three: what if Andy
 gets cold feet? I mean, Rachel was the hit. Is Caroline enough, or will he be tempted
 just to take out Sam and I and preserve his placement
 in the underdogs? Beyond that, we need Caroline-- who knows her name
is out there-- to not have anything, as well, because if she's nervous,
 maybe she'll protect herself. GENEVIEVE:
In my head, I'm doing the math, and, uh, it's grim,
 to say the least. There are more ways
 this can go wrong than ways it can go right. Yo u kn ow yo u wa nt a b ur ge r. So make it

of our jury. Okay, let's start
with the reward challenge. Sam, you win it.
It comes with a big reward. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Go to the sanctuary, Italian food,
you're gonna spend the night and you get letters from home. So, winning that reward comes with strategic power and strategic risk. You chose Andy and Genevieve
to go with you. So, walk me through
how that went at the sanctuary. SAM:
Yeah, I mean, it was all of your wishes of what you want
on a Survivor reward. But as good as it feels
for yourself, as good as it feels to give
somebody that opportunity to, like, have that day, you're also the person
taking that away from four other people. PROBST:
What was the sanctuary like for you, Genevieve? Can I give you a bit of a longer
answer to this question? -Sure.
-So, when I came into this game, I was Genevieve the person
and Genevieve the player. And before I knew it, I put up, like, a little wall to make it
easier to think strategically, and I thought I was blocking out
all the bad feelings. But what I was doing
was keeping them in. The letters from home gave me just the perspective
I needed. It made me
feel like myself again. It reminded me you are better off
if you connect with people. It was the first time today
that I felt the value of community here. So, it was a very meaningful experience for me. PROBST:
Andy, Genevieve shared a very personal experience
at the sanctuary. How was it for you? Well, first of all,
I mean, I resonate with what Genevieve is saying. I mean, we have our games, and we have our journeys,
and they're intertwined. So, choosing who you're gonna
bring on something like that-- it's a game decision,
but we see beyond the game when we're letting each other
into our home lives and the people who love us. It's just undeniable
how much it meant. PROBST:
Teeny, you have the reward on one part of this. That's the strategic decision
that Sam makes. But then you hear the impact on these humans
that you've been living with in this jungle
with this community while playing against them, but the result is the same. You weren't chosen. TEENY:
Here's the thing, Jeff. I don't think it's a secret
that I came into this game, and I really didn't have
an emotional wall up. Uh, the way
that I approach this is by connecting with other people,
being open, being myself. It's the only way
that I've ever been able to survive in any situation. And so, not being chosen was, oddly, an opportunity for me to strategically think
about my placement in this game, why I wasn't chosen,
who was chosen, and a path forward.
So, it sort of reversed me
out of this emotional... ...rut I have been in
in the game. Caroline, that is fascinating that you can have
such different experiences as a result of one challenge. Absolutely.
I love Teeny's mindset. I feel like there were a lot
of opportunities in us not being chosen. The people who are left behind
are in the majority. We have so much time to think, so much time
to talk all to ourselves. PROBST:
Sue, the words from Teeny and Caroline
certainly sound foreboding. Like, ""Oh, go ahead. ""Have your little ""reward and your nice journey. The four of us
will be back at camp plotting your demise."" -(Sue laughs)
-I mean, am I wrong? No, you're not wrong. I think the part
that got me was, I pictured... getting those letters. So, it's painful, but it didn't kill me. It made me stronger. -Hmm.
-SUE: And that's what I love about this game, is that we're all hitting low notes, but we're coming back
feeling more empowered to say, ""You know what? I got to take the reins
by the horn..."" You know, the horn, whatever
it is, whatever it's called, and just, like, go with this and just keep pulling forward. And that's what it did for me. PROBST:
Teeny, would it be reasonable to assume that maybe
the four of you-- Sue, Rachel, Caroline and yourself-- taking out one
of the three of them? I think you'd be stupid not to have that thought
cross your mind if you're one
of the three of them. Just like I think
we'd be stupid to not think that the three of them
are coming up with a plan that's against one of us. But the thing is, seven people, I think, have three questions
in their mind. One of them is, ""Who can I beat sitting next to
at Final Tribal Council?"" The second one is, ""How do I get
to Final Tribal Council? ""Who is in my way? ""Whether I'm not a part
of their endgame plans, they're not a part of mine."" And the third one, I think,
""Is our perception ""of who the biggest threat
to win is ""the same as their perception of who the biggest threat
to win is?"" And I think the phrase ""perception is reality"" in Survivor is as common
as hearing ""bless you"" in response to a sneeze.
Like, it is something that is almost just desensitized at this point, regardless of who was on the reward
and who was at camp. It's something that's wheeling
through all of our minds the second
we're all back together. PROBST:
Rachel, you were nodding. Yeah. I mean, I agree.
This is day 22. The only thing you have to do
is think about your endgame and who you want to be with. Can you trust those people that
you think want to be with you, that you want to be with? It's a cyclical thing
that my brain just continues to mull over
all day, every day. PROBST:
So, Sue, after today's
immunity challenge, Rachel wins her second necklace, is safe again,
you all get back to camp. What was the vibe today? Today was almost
like a more relaxed vibe. People weren't scurrying off
and going, having conversations. It was very different than
what you would normally expect. PROBST:
Andy, does that line up
with what you saw, that it was kind of
an easygoing afternoon? It's the classic Survivor thing.
Like, everyone's sitting pretty,
and everything's so easy. What's really going on? Like, where's the catch, right? CAROLINE:
But it's not that
we're happy-go-lucky and relaxed. I think what you're seeing is a plan being acted out that doesn't need
much talking to act out. TEENY:
Jeff, the thing is, a lot of us have proved to each other
trust already, and a pecking order
has been decided, and that's that. PROBST:
Wow. Andy, if that's true, that's terrifying if you're not
in on the vote because it's essentially saying,
""You won't change us. We've already talked through it,
and we have a decision."" I mean, typically, I would say, conventional wisdom says
if you're on the outside of it, you got to be
tearing walls down, you got to be, like, going nuts. And so, obviously, I don't think anyone wants
to go home tonight, but at the same time, I don't
think everyone feels secure, and it's either
going to be resulting in something kind of cut-and-dry
that people have accepted or it's masking something that I can't see right now. PROBST:
Sam, are you expecting that it might be you tonight? Yeah, I mean,
I think it's kind of been, like, I'm at the end of my rope
in a lot of ways, and I've been hanging on as I get closer down,
like, the knots. Uh, and the reward didn't help. And so, it's a really
powerless feeling tonight, for me. PROBST:
How you feeling right now, Genevieve,
getting ready to vote? I'm totally fine and confident,
in a weird way. Not on how the vote's gonna go, but just of where I'm at. And tonight's vote isn't about just
scraping by for me. I'm swinging
for the fences because I don't want to just
get to sixth and go home. I want to try,
like everyone else is, and I know
what I want to happen, so that's what I'm gonna
try and make happen. PROBST:

to have something to eat. It's nice. A hot meal. The sheer emotion I just felt from eating that one piece
of coconut is actually wild. That's awesome. I'm Liz Wilcox, and I'm allergic to everything.

to camp this afternoon."" -I really want to go.
-Okay. All right. -You're cool with that?
-Yeah, cool. I really want to go.
 However, Jelinsky's the first one to put up his hand

 ""Okay, if you want to do it."" That's gonna put a target. He wants to go, let him go.
I don't want that target on me. I'm feeling really lucky. TEVIN:

somethin' in your pocket-- that could be really powerful. JELINSKY:
I did not have to work my tribe at all to go on the journey, and I'm playing Survivor like I'm going to win this game. My mind's on an advantage. You know, I'm not here
 to sit around all day and play nice-nice
 like everybody else. I'm here
 to win a million dollars. -Hello, hello.
-Oh, my God. Hi! -Jelinsky-- that's it, right?
-Jelinsky. That's right. And this is where great Survivors are made. This is where
the legends are made. Jelinsky is a legend. -Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy. -Oh.
-This looks exciting. -Oh, God.
-Okay. I'm actually gonna pee my pants. -Like, I'm not okay.
-(laughing)
-Oh, okay, so we... JELINSKY:
Yeah, let's go ahead
and flip them over. TEVIN:
 The adrenaline is up
 because the stipulations of the game are as follows. And the person that has
the torch symbol is going to reveal
that they have that symbol. The other two are then going to try to convince
the person who has the torch that one of them
has the vote card. The stakes are ridiculous. Your vote is on the line. But whoever's right
 get an extra vote. Oh, spicy. Spicy mami. Okay. MARIA:
 I got the torch. My job is to decipher
 who has the vote card. TEVIN:
 I look at my card. And what do I see?
 The vote card. I get to tell you the truth,
just about the truth. It's the easiest form
of acting that exists. JELINSKY:
 And as soon as I saw
 that I picked the skull, I knew that
 I had to lie to Maria. So it becomes a game of deception. Talk to me. Well... Plead your case,
and then I'll have questions. Well, Maria... I'm not gonna lie to you. I have the vote card. I don't want you
to make the wrong decision. That's all I got to say. -Maria?
-Yes. Yes, Tevin? I'm just gonna tell you
right here, right now, clear as day, that that vote
card is right here. -Okay.
-JELINSKY: I-I promise you,
though, like, I have the vote card. I'm not lying to you. TEVIN:
I would hate for you to lose your vote,
is what I would hate for, and I'd hate to lose my vote,
so I'm pleading that you pick this so
that we can have an extra vote. 'Cause if you pick that one, my God, today,
you might be disappointed. MARIA:
 There's something in my gut that's saying, ""Jelinsky's
 lying,"" but I'm not 100%. So, my heart was pounding
 out of my chest because if I choose wrong,
then I'm gonna lose a vote. -All right, so...
-I'm so sorry. Let's talk about this. If, and you're being honest
with me, Tevin, -I'm being 100% honest.
-then I can trust that we can work together. But Jelinsky, losing my vote
would not be good. So, if I find out
that you were lying, I will have to go back
and tell my tribe the deceit. -Ooh.
-MARIA: So, I'm gonna give you all
another chance. You know what?
I'll-I'll be honest, 'cause I'm not
""deceptful"" at all. I-I do have the skull card. Don't pick it. You know, this is
a nerve-wracking thing. So you're saying
you have the skull card? I do. I have the skull card. TEVIN:
 Lord have mercy. He literally folded his cards. Jelinsky has, in this moment,
just given up his vote. But Maria and I get
 an extra vote. -Should we shake hands on it?
-Shake hands?
-Shake hands. -Go like this, do it this way?
-Shake hands?
-Uh-huh. -I'm sorry I was deceptive.
I was scared.
-That's okay. It's because of me
 that Jelinsky totally quit. Like, I felt super
on top of the world. It felt super powerful. JELINSKY:
 Growing up in Las Vegas, you got to know
when to hold 'em, you got to know
when to fold 'em, you got to know
when to walk away. And it was my time
to fold 'em and walk away. I'd rather lose my vote
 for one Tribal Council than lie to Tevin and Maria and make 12 enemies
 going into the merge. I know, I know, I know. You'd do
really great on the show. That's what you're saying

-Q: Hey! He's back! (Jelinsky sighs) JELINSKY:
I will give y'all all the tea. So, we had to play a game. There were three cards. And the torch card
had to figure out whether the skull card
was lying about what they had. So, of course, I picked the
skull, which was unfortunate. And at first, I lied to them. That probably lasted a minute and then I was like,
""Yeah, I'm lying."" -TIFFANY: What?! Why?
-KENZIE: Why? Why do you care what they...? JELINSKY:
It was a lose-lose situation. If I lied, they both -would have lost their vote.
-KENZIE: So? So?
-So? KENZIE: Jelinsky confessed
 'cause he didn't want the people on the other tribe
to lose their vote. Who cares?
 They're not on our tribe. Like, you didn't even
 fight for us? You're supposed to be my number. All you had to do was lie
to strangers. So you're the only person
that lost the vote? Right. And they both
have extra votes now. -Okay.
-It was a bad situation. I felt so bad. I just felt
obligated to tell the truth. BHANU:
 Jelinsky--
 he gives up too quickly. Are you kidding me? This is Survivor. You cannot give up like that.
Have you seen Jeff talk to you? You got to dig deep. Hello. CHARLIE: I can't figure out
why Jelinsky would say that. MORIAH: You mom'd the heck

Maria's extra vote-- it is scary because I want

and take out the guys. So, this is really, really bad. JESS:
 Since we got here,
 I have no idea if I slept. And last night,
I went straight to the shelter. When I tried to lie down, lay down... Lied down? Laid down. And that did not go well, either. (wood snapping) -You okay?
-(laughing)
-TIFFANY: Hello. -No, I'm good, I'm good.
-Q: It can hold on its own. I don't think I've slept at all. I'm, like, running on empty.
I don't sleep at night. Without sleep,
you're not gonna be strong. No, and I can't even
think straight. I got my ADHD diagnosis
in the last couple of years, and it's-it's been
 difficult out here. On such little sleep
and food and water, it's making me kind of...
It's making my head spin. And I feel like
 it's, like, affecting me in worse ways than I imagined. Oh, my God.
I lost my water bottle. -Q: You lost it again?
-This always happens to me. This is my nightmare,
coming out here, is that I would lose my stuff. I'm losing things,
 like, all over the place. My ADHD is, like,
 messing everything up. I feel like I have to kind of
shrink a little bit and not be as, like...
take as much social initiative
 as other people do. That is not a good strategy.
 Like, I need to take
a little bit more initiative. No, and I'm scared to

 Oh, my God. If I found an idol,
I would lose it anyway. BHANU:
 I'm not trying
 to be sketchy, but I'm always looking for an idol. It's extremely stressful because I don't want to be caught. I don't want
to be caught doing this. (vocalizing) All right. Where are you hiding? And I've been looking
 high and low everywhere. It's super hard. Why-why do they make it look
so, like, easy? -They make it so easy
on TV, man.
-Yes. BHANU:
 Everyone's searching
 for an idol, but I don't want anyone
 to find an idol before me. Calm yourself down and think. I'm gonna find that guy.
I'm gonna find that idol. (whispering):
I found something. Yo! It's a Beware Advantage. TIFFANY:
 Not for one second
 did it cross my mind to put
 the Beware Advantage back. This is mine.
I earned it, I found it. I don't care what's in here. I'm doing it or I'll deal
 with the consequences. I didn't come out here to play scared. People who play scared go home. Girl, we got to go back. Where'd you find it? TIFFANY: I read the clue
 real quick, and it says I got to go back to the spot
where I found it and dig a hole. We digging, digging,
 digging, digging. Pull out this big box
 with a lock on it. All right. -Yeah, you did lose your vote.
Your vote is gone.
-Okay. -Damn. All right,
I got to bury it.
-You got to bury it back. TIFFANY:
 So until I have the idol,
 I can't vote. ""That's why it says beware."" (laughs) (shrieking):
 Ah! But if we lose
 an immunity challenge, I have to return to that spot.
 There better just be a key waiting there for me
and not no extra stuff. If we have to tell the boys,
we have to tell the boys. -They're are numbers. It's fine.
-Okay. It's fine. TIFFANY: The more people
 that know about the idol, the more messy it's gonna get. But, I mean,
it's a Beware Advantage, right? So this is the kind of advantage
 that you kind of need people to be on your side for. I don't have a vote. I found
a Beware Advantage today. -You don't have a vote?
-I don't. So if Jelinsky loses his vote,
and I lose my vote, it's y'all two, Jess and Bhanu. -Do not tell Jelinsky.
-I'm not telling him anything. TIFFANY:
 I don't care
 if I don't have a vote. I'll figure it out. I ain't nervous at all.

this challenge from the get-go. -Got it.
-From the gecko. From the gecko--
we see what you did there. -From the get-go!
-HUNTER: No pun intended. -(grunting)
-PROBST: Yanu's got it up. -Clip in.
-Jess, climb up, climb up. You're good, Yanu.
Start working. -It is Nami
decidedly in the lead,
-Come on, y'all! but Siga does not have
such a big advantage that this is over. Yanu could catch you.
You better keep moving. -Yanu, you got a shot.
-There you go. It's gonna come down
to Jelinsky and Jess for Yanu and Moriah and Maria for Siga. Soda and Venus clearly
in control right now. -Two pieces left.
-Come on, Jeff! -Come on, Jeff.
-PROBST: One piece left
for Nami. For the win. There it is!
Nami wins immunity! -(cheering)
-We're looking for one more. It's now between Siga and Yanu. Build out the right. PROBST:
Jelinsky's stacking,
and Jess is putting 'em in. If this strategy works,
they can make a fast catch-up. -BEN: Great, Maria.
-CHARLIE: There you go. Yes. There. Right there. No, up one. -To your right!
-PROBST:
Jelinsky a little confused. -No. The one you just put down!
-To your right! (indistinct,
overlapping chatter) Keep going! Siga with another piece. Jess trying to find another
for Yanu. -And she's got it.
-Beautiful. PROBST:
Is it too little
too late for Yanu? They took forever
to get their gecko up here. Jess. Come on, Jess! Jelinsky trying to get one,
gives it to Jess. -Yes!
-PROBST: It's not gonna matter. -(shrieking)
-It's over. Siga wins immunity, joining Nami, safe in the game, sending Yanu to Tribal Council, where somebody
will be the first person voted out of Survivor 46. Wow. All right,
Nami, congratulations. (whooping)
Take it, V. Nobody going home from Nami. Grab your stuff, head out. -Siga, congratulations.
-(whooping) Well earned.
Grab your stuff, head out. -Enjoy the night off.
-Thank you. Bhanu, what's gonna happen
when you get back to camp? 'Cause now it's real. You're
voting somebody out tonight. Sorry, Jeff. Um... It's-it's breaking my heart
that one of us has to go home, and... it's really hard. We put in a lot of effort
to be on this, and Survivor means a lot
to all of us. No one wants to go home, and here we are. I don't know. All right, Yanu, waiting
back at camp will be your pot and your machete. As a penalty for losing--
sorry for you-- I'm gonna keep your flint.
Tribal Council tonight where somebody
will be the first person voted out of Survivor 46. Grab your stuff. Head out.
See you tonight at Tribal. BHANU:
 No one wants
 to be the first person to walk away from Survivor, but this is a game, this is a serious business,
 someone has to go, and I think Jelinsky and Jess
 are targets tonight. But this is Survivor. Anything can happen. The game is on, 24 by seven. It's so hard. Ge ne ra li ze d my as th en ia g ra vi s made my life a lot harder. But the picture

Does anybody need
their canteen filled? -You guys coming, too?
-Probably gonna kick back for a little bit. There's no stopping in the game of Survivor. We got to vote tonight. We got to make sure
 we're locked in, and I'm going into
 Tribal Council without a vote. But I do feel pretty confident because I feel like
 I have a great alliance with Q, Kenzie and Tiff. We have a solid four. All of my allies
are locked in with me. I did want to just chill out
for a little bit. Really? You think
that's better for your game than going where everyone is? (laughs) -How are you feeling?
-Scared. I'm, like,
one of the smallest people here. Yeah. I mean, I know our names
are on the block. My name is on the block? I just figured
'cause we were at the puzzle. I think Jess has
 to be the first one to go. I just wanted to make it seem
 like I'm nervous because I do not want Jess playing
her Shot in the Dark tonight. And if I could get
 Jess out of here without even casting a vote? Oh, my God. That's Survivor legend status to me. I just want y'all to know
I don't want any of you going home, period. BHANU:
What is the plan, then? So, the real plan is Jess. The fake plan that
we're telling Jess is Jelinsky. TIFFANY:
 People want Jess
 to be the first vote, right? Me included.
 The vibes don't... They not vibing
 when I talk to Jess. And I'm really bummed that we lost the immunity challenge. Psych. I don't care.
I'm happy we lost the immunity challenge. Now I get further instructions
 for the idol. Okay. TIFFANY: And I needed
 to have my vote back because your vote is your voice in this game. Girl. I got to crack this message
to find the location of the key. My heart sank. When I opened it up,
it was a friggin' puzzle. And now I have
 to decode this alien language to figure out where my key is. All right, let's see.
I think this word is ""the."" So that means this is T. Maybe this is O. I mean, I love it. I don't know where
your brain's at, but beautiful. TIFFANY:
 I am a visual artist, so, doing the puzzle--
 it's just like a friggin' light bulb just
went off in my head, and I just started rolling through it. TIFFANY:
 But then, of course,
 here comes Q and Bhanu, curbing the corner. So I knew I had to boogie. I had literally two words left. Oh. Oh. ""Point."" ""Your key is tied to a rock in the shallow waters
at the point."" What is the point? I run over there to the point or what I think is the point,
 and I'm just turning over every rock. Oh. Behind a rock. I'm turning over everything.
 Crabs jumping out at me, all kinds of crap. I'm sweating bullets. (gasps)
Yes! Oh! Yes! Yes! I untied the key,
 and I hauled ass. Oh, my God. (gasps)
Yes! (whispers): Yes! Yes. Yes. I had to work for this. Survivor bucket list item...
achieved. This is a real, true idol. -No catches. -KENZIE: Whatever you're doing, you have to do it quick. -You got it?
-Yeah, I got it. -You did?
-I did. Now, I mean, unless some talks are happening right now
that I don't know, it's looking like
 Jess to go home. When you don't deliver
time and time again, in my world, you get dismissed. Where I come from,
 hard work is respected. Jelinsky talks a good game,
 but doesn't show up to play. I don't need talkers. I need soldiers who's willing
to go to battle, do the job. I can't go to war with him. JELINSKY:
I want our four to go deep. Me too. I mean,
it's kind of our only option. I think we could
seriously run things. Q:
 A lot of folks think
 Jess is going home, but I'm writing
 Jelinsky's name down. Big letters. I don't know
how to spell it yet, but his name will be
written down, from me, tonight. I cannot have Jelinsky
to come back. Q: Correct. -And then, Jelinsky,
I don't trust at all.
-Correct. JESS: Q's saying
 Jelinsky's the target, but I'm very nervous about tonight.
Nobody wants to be the first person
 voted out and, like, I was a common denominator
 in our puzzle failures. Maybe they're trying to,
 like, butter me up just to vote me out. I think it will benefit us to
get Jess first, then Jelinsky. Jelinsky has told us he can do
everything under the moon. So what is he good at?
He's weak. I don't know
if Kenzie's gonna go for voting Jelinsky out first. Maybe we might have
to think about this. What Tiff is saying
is also super valid. -Yeah.
-It's super, super valid. I don't know. I'm so... I'm so torn. I like Jelinsky.
 I like that kid. -I'm a little nervous.
I'm just...
-Here. BHANU:
 And I really like Jess. Come here. BHANU: She's the one
 who's consoling me, but I'm gonna
 suck up my emotions, drain my tears, just put the name on the parchment
tonight and be at peace with it. I mean, Jess was a little better
at the puzzle today. Jelinsky was looking like a deer
in the headlights. -BHANU: Yeah, but...
-KENZIE: But we wouldn't
have gotten to the puzzle without Jelinsky.
We need to look at the standard of who's gonna
be able to carry us, literally, through challenges. Jess is our weakest
in the physicality realm... That's me, personal. KENZIE:
 Oh, my gosh. It's a mess. We aren't on the same page.
 Like, what should we do? Jess isn't really
 bringing a strength. And sure, she's sweet, but it's really hard
to work with someone that you can't get a read on. But then, with Jelinsky,
I don't want to play with people who just give up.
Like, I'm not gonna give up on anything. Rule number one
 of playing the game-- that one, you don't quit. First Tribal is crucial. Lines get drawn. You know who to trust,

Go ahead and grab a torch, dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council because in this game,
fire represents your life. When your fire's gone,
so are you. All right, so let's go back
to the beginning. Jess, what surprised you most
these first three days? Oh, man. I think... I... I knew that it would be
physically challenging, but more than anything,
it's the sleep deprivation that is really messing with me and just really
messing with my ability to process information. PROBST:
Is it because you're
choosing not to sleep or you just can't
physically get... JESS:
I can't physically sleep,
and I thought that I would
be physically exhausted enough because we've all been
working so hard. I thought that I would be
physically exhausted enough to just, like,
go out like a light, and that's how I usually am
at home. PROBST:
I want to circle back
to the Sweat task because I still have some
questions about what happened. Q, walk me through it. Q:
So we had to, Jeff, climb up Mount Everest, climb down Mount Everest, go into the ocean
with holes in a bucket, and we're like, ""Oh, my. What has Jeff
put us through now?"" So, we decided to not finish it
with maybe about two hours and 45 minutes left. PROBST:
So, Jelinsky, I got a slightly different story
from you today. Honestly, Jeff, Q and I
share the same mentality. We're the type of dudes
to not give up on anything. -You know? If...
-PROBST: Wait a second. That's an impossible statement
to make given that Q said you just gave up. Okay.
I see your point, Jeff, but I'm saying if we had all day to fill up that damn bucket,
we would have. PROBST:
Jelinsky, what's
fascinating to me is the reluctance to own
that you quit. You're right.
We quit the challenge. There's no way around it, and
I'm gonna own up to it now. We quit the challenge,
and that's that. Okay, let's move on
to the journey. Jelinsky, you go
on this journey. -What happened?
-JELINSKY: Honestly, Jeff, I was so excited to go, but lo and behold, Jelinsky doesn't have
a vote tonight. And Jelinsky has never talked in
third person in his life before. -But tonight,
it especially sucks.
-Let me... let me step in.
He gave his vote away. Again, a different version
of a story. Q:
He gave it away.
He traded his vote for them
to have two extra votes. It's not good in my books. JELINSKY:
I was in a tough spot. You know, I'm not
a deceptive person, so I realized the cards were
literally stacked against me. There was not much I could do. In fact, them having
extra votes might work to our advantage one day, and
we'll just have to wait and see. JESS:
How would that work
to our advantage one day--
them having extra votes? They might want
to work with us and say, ""Hey, you guys vote this way,
I'm gonna use my extra vote, and we're golden."" Maybe they're not
gonna vote you out, but we ain't give them
them extra votes. You did. It's a game
for a million dollars, Jeff. We're not handing out favors. PROBST:
And, Jess,
that's part of the design of a journey. What do you do
when you're alone? -Yeah.
-Do you make a decision
that's good -for the group?
-Yeah. But... I don't know. (laughing):
Come back to me in a second. PROBST:
Are you really struggling -right now?
-JESS: I am really struggling. Like, my brain is, like,
somewhere else right now. Like, and I must have said that
the first day, but it's, like,
really somewhere else now. I'm like mush mouth.
I, like... I... I can't even
string sentences together. PROBST:
I'm fascinated by -how open you're...
-JESS: I'm an alien. I don't
understand myself, either. PROBST:
And, Jess, it happens
to a lot of players, and it sometimes never goes away. -You just can never catch up.
-God. -Yeah.
-So you're struggling
with even something as simple -as spelling your name.
-JESS: Yeah. Don't learn how
to spell my name, please. (laughing) -PROBST: So, Kenzie?
-KENZIE: Yes. PROBST:
We're only three days in. Where is this tribe right now? KENZIE:
Well, it's difficult, because we have lost everything
together. We've gone through it all
together. You get super close super quick. And now we have
to cut someone out. It's... it's tough. PROBST:
So, Bhanu, how do you make that first decision
about who to send home? (sighs) This is a challenging vote
for me. Um, I want to work with someone who's gonna be good socially, not someone who's not giving any clue of what's going on
in their mind. PROBST:
How about for you, Tiffany? TIFFANY:
For me, it comes down
to one thing. What four people can I go back
to the tribe with that's not gonna put me back
here again in a couple of days. -I don't care
about nothing else.
-So you're talking about -tribe strength in challenges?
-TIFFANY: Yeah. PROBST:
And Jelinsky, that's one of the fundamental dilemmas
of Survivor, is tribe versus self. JELINSKY:
One hundred percent. I
understand what they're saying. I am still 100% into this tribe. Like, I want
to stay in this game. I just don't want my efforts
to be lost in a decision like a journey,
and I will never, ever give up in a challenge. Except for the Sweat test. (laughing) -And the journey.
-And the journey. (laughing) Thank you for reminding me. (laughing) Jess, given what some
of the people have said they're looking for
in a tribemate, are you worried
that your inability right now to form sentences-- do you think it's impacting
your ability to connect -or do you feel solid?
-JESS: No. This
is only happening in, like, public settings, but in my one-on-one or, like,
smaller groups, I think I'm a lot more coherent because I do feel like
I'm delivering at camp and I do feel like I'm
delivering at the challenges. Even though I just shouldn't
have volunteered for the puzzle. -Yeah. Again.
-JELINSKY: Jeff, I think Jess and I are definitely
in the same boat. I feel like a lot
of the pressure is on us, especially being the common
denominators in the puzzle. PROBST:
Jess, he is determined
to get you -in this boat with him.
-JESS: I don't want to be in that boat! I feel like
I worked really, really hard. I do not deserve
to be in that boat. Jeff, I don't
have a vote tonight, so maybe I am
subconsciously deflecting. But I love Jess.
Like, Jess is awesome. -Thank you.
-You're welcome. -(laughing)
-I'm a nice guy, man. I don't like fighting. I don't
like being the center.... Nobody thinks
you're not a nice guy. -We love you.
-We all think you're a nice guy. -I know.
-BHANU: Jeff, I love this kid. Like, I...
This kid is really awesome. But I don't know
how the tribe is feeling. Is it too little, too late? Like, I don't know, so... So you're feeling in your heart
that it's Jelinsky tonight? It's time to vote? (laughing) -Oh, ...
-(laughing) I don't know
if I'm ready for that, Jeff. TIFFANY:
Hey, yo. -Oh.
-PROBST: Wow. Jelinsky. That did not sound good. JELINSKY:
Jeff, all I know is, as long as I'm in this game,
I'm giving 100% effort in every single challenge we do, and I just want us to be
the strongest tribe possible going forward. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Kenzie, you're up. Wow. This is so beautiful. Oh, I never want
to see another gecko again. (sighs) (sighs) Oh, my God. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right.
I'll read the votes. First vote: Jelinsky. Jelinsky.
That's two votes Jelinsky. First person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jelinsky. That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. Jelinsky, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.

47,13,Bob and Weave,"Welcome to a special two-hour
penultimate episode of Survivor 47. Like any season of Survivor, this one's been unique, and it's really centered
around two big themes. Number one:
a constant shift of power. Every player in the game has
been on the bottom and the top. The other theme is some
very savvy social gameplay, which has made it
very hard to know who's telling the truth
and who's lying. And it's led
to some big moments, like last week's
Operation Italy, a beautifully-executed charade that took Caroline
out of the game and left us with six players. A final six that nobody
would have predicted on day one, starting with Andy. Got off to
one of the worst starts in the history of Survivor. But instead of giving in,
he dug in and he found his footing,
and he's still here. Sam: he had power
early in the game, but since the merge,
he's been on the bottom and has had to play scrappy
every day just to alive. Genevieve: she is social,
she's strategic, she is cutthroat,
and everybody knows it. And that's why she has
a very big target on her back. Sue: she's got an idol.
Nobody knows about it. But her real strength in
the game has come from loyalty. And with the Caroline vote-out,
she lost her last ally. And for the first time
this season, Sue is alone in the game. Teeny: she's been very open. She's an emotional player. It's worked for her,
it's worked against her. But what has kept her in
the game are her social skills. Finally, Rachel. She's already won two
individual immunity challenges. She has a Block a Vote and
an idol that nobody knows about. That is a lot of power with only
six players left in the game and she's gonna need it
because right now, Rachel is the biggest threat
in the game. All right, tonight we're gonna
have two challenges, two Tribal Councils. We'll go from six
to five to four, and if you can get to four,
then at the very least, you are guaranteed
a shot to make fire and you got a shot
to win this game. But all it takes
is just one mistake and your game is done. That's why Survivor is so difficult to win and so fun to watch. All right, here we go. ♪ ♪ Previously on Survivor... ANDY:
This is the defining night for the rest of this game. ANDY:
 The goal is build suspicion that one of you has an idol. If we do that, they will be compelled
 to split the vote. I'm most afraid of the idol. CAROLINE:
So then, we would need -to then split the vote.
-Yeah. Thank you, Andy. This is the biggest heist of Survivor. Yeah. ANDY:
 And we're calling it Operation Italy. PROBST:
If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Twelfth person
voted out of Survivor 47 and the fifth member
of our jury: -Caroline.
-Okay. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ SUE:
 Tribal really sucked tonight. Caroline was blindsided, so, I lost my only Tuku member left. I'm just so bummed. Thank God that I have an idol, because I'm in trouble. Andy was supposed to be working
 with myself, Rachel, Caroline and Teeny, but Andy freakin' flipped. So right now, I want to rip
 Andy's head off his shoulders. Ugh! So frustrated. So frustrated. (laughing) Oh, my God. ANDY:
 Tribal was incredible. Operation Italy. It went off to perfection. And to sit here having pulled off
the biggest move of the season, this is the feeling you want
 when you come out here. Like, I'm playing Survivor for real. I'm actually doing it, and...
(laughs) I love... It's-it's... Okay, can I say,
I'm so happy to hear that? I-I feel the love tonight. -No.
-No. GENEVIEVE:
 Tonight, Sam and I were both on the chopping block, so, by all accounts, I should not
be sitting here today to speak about the success
of Operation Italy. It was such a long shot, but it worked. (laughs) Andy-- he is... better at this game
than we all thought or... we're all worse
than we thought. SUE:
I've never seen someone
flip-flop so much in my life. Just...
I have no respect for people that just flip-flop,
but whatever. I'm so pissed at him. It is safe to say that not
one single thing went the way I thought it was going to go
at Tribal Council. Me, Rachel and Sue
 all look like idiots because we had a plan. And Andy flipped on us. And so,
 we need to talk right now. Because what the hell, Andy? That was insane to do. Why don't we run this back
first and let's explain -what just happened.
-Well, I-I thought of this on the way to Tribal Council. I was like, ""This is better
in pretty much every way."" So, we spilt up Caroline, Sue and Rachel. TEENY:
 It seemed like Genevieve and Sam knew you were going to do this
all along. No. (laughs) I know I need
 to do damage control. Teeny is feeling like I have joined Genevieve and Sam in a grand conspiracy
to take over the game. That is true. But no, no, no,
 we can't let her believe that. Those are, like... SAM:
Yeah. Right now, there's six of us left
 in the game. That makes it
 extra important for us to recruit Teeny
 as a majority vote. Fortunately,
 Teeny's kind of, like, confused about what happened. And so, we play it off like it was this happy accident. The fact is, you lied to me,
thinking I was going home. -Yes.
-Andy wanted to vote me home, but then changed his mind
to save me. So I told Genevieve to
play the idol, which was best for her, but she didn't
trust me on my gut, -so then she didn't play it.
-(laughing) And then somehow,
we came out with the idol -and Caroline went home.
-(laughing) SAM:
 I think Teeny, right now,
 is in panic mode, and she's very
 vulnerable, and so, Teeny bought it
every single step of the way. So, it was... chef's kiss. I walked out
of that Tribal Council just, like, smiling,
looking at the stars. -I smiled and shook my head.
-And I... I was just like, ""How the ... did that happen?"" TEENY:
 At this point, I have no idea what my way
to the end is anymore. I don't trust anybody anymore. And with six people left,
there's really nowhere to hide. At this point, this is... -Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. -This is who it's gonna be.
-Yeah.
-Yeah. If we get Rachel out,
this is who it's gonna be. Even though me and Rachel
 were working together, she is the biggest
challenge threat at this point, and she's the biggest
 fire threat at the final four. So, my brain does make a switch.
I do want to work with Sam and Genevieve and Andy
to get Rachel out of this game. This is really a moment of having to jump ship
and adapt in Survivor. SUE:
Did Teeny go down with them? So, when we got back
 from Tribal, Andy, Teeny, Sam and Genevieve take off. And I just felt like,
 in that moment, I needed to know
 what was going on, and I followed them. I think one of the things
 that you can't grasp at home, because you always see
the, like, infrared camera, and, you know, it feels like there's got to be
a flashlight somewhere, but you can't see anything. It's dark.
 It's pitch black. -(laughing)
-GENEVIEVE: I don't
appreciate it... RACHEL:
 I mean, I couldn't see them.
 I could only hear them. -So I'm following their voices. -(Genevieve laughing) And I basically
 crawl on my belly underneath a bush right next to them, and I just listen
to their entire conversation. SAM:
Sol saved her,
she took out Kyle -with beating him the necklace,
she became the challenge champ
-Yeah. -after him.
-She's incredible at challenges. And I think she has
a really close relationship with Caroline. -So... she cannot win.
-She can't win. -She cannot win.
-I think everything is kind of crystallized,
and we just have to gun for the immunity necklace. So I find out so much. I learn that
 they're all gunning for me. I hear my name. I hear,
""She cannot win tomorrow,"" ""Anybody but her."" -(laughing): That's so bad.
-Genevieve, I told you you do have nerves of steel.
When you didn't play that thing, I was like, ""Wait a minute."" RACHEL:
 I found out Genevieve does have an idol, and that she has balls of steel
to have not played it yet. Do you know what she's got?
Does she have an idol? She does not have an idol.
She has a Block a Vote. She can block somebody's vote. RACHEL:
 And finally, when Teeny told Sam and
 Genevieve about my advantage, that's when I knew
 that I didn't have Teeny. But the good news is that
they don't know I have an idol, which is brilliant in the sense that they will never
see an idol coming from me. I... Okay. RACHEL:
 And so, with this information, I have more legs in this game than anybody at camp
 realizes, and I can hopefully turn this game around. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ SUE:
 In the early morning,
 I woke up, and I'm feeling a little broken.
 I'm just like, ""Oh, my God.
Like, put me out of my misery."" Oh, my poor Caroline. I lost my girl. It freakin' sucks to lose my last number one. I'm devastated,
 but in the same breath, it's something else
 I just got to suck up and just stand up
and start playing the game hard. I have an idol,
but I want to find another idol. I want to find an advantage.
I want to still keep searching. I just have to believe that there's one more thing
out there. I'm looking for a miracle.
 Yeah, on Survivor. Is that possible? Is it possible to find a miracle
on Survivor? Are you okay? I want to dig around this.
I want to dig-- Can we please dig around this? -Hey.
-I don't care if that
something's happened here. I have an idol. I found it
day after the auction, and I haven't told
a single person. I'm sorry. You've been
digging up everything? Mm-hmm. -...you don't
have to dig here, okay?
-Okay. Rachel shows up.
 She says, ""Don't worry. I have the idol."" And I'm like, ""Oh, my God."" So now I know her secret. She has
 a Block a Vote Advantage and she has an idol. I feel I've-I've built a good alliance with Rachel. I trust her.
She's shared so much with me. You cannot tell anybody, okay? I'm not.
We cannot tell anybody, okay? SUE:
 But I'm not sharing
 that I have an idol, too, because everybody
 wants her out, so, I might be able
to hold it one more day. If I don't win today,
I'm getting all the votes because now that
I've won two immunities, -I'm this huge threat.
-Mm-hmm. -So I think that
we can trick them.
-Okay. Okay. -I think we can do this.
-Yeah. I think we have... we have...
We're not dead. -Okay.
-Okay? RACHEL:
 It was scary to tell Sue
 about the idol, but at this point, I need Sue. I have nobody else in this game, and if I'm gonna pull off
anything, I need her trust. We have to pretend
because Genevieve has an idol. And so, I tell her my plan. We have to pretend
like Teeny is still with us. We have to act like we have
no idea that she has flipped. I just want
 to make them feel comfortable so they don't know
 I have an idol, and I would kind of just be able
to, like, smoke 'em. TEENY:
Tree mail! All right. Day 23, immunity
challenge. Let's hear it. RACHEL:
 I need immunity today so badly. RACHEL: Oh, God. GENEVIEVE: Oh, no. RACHEL:
 If I win today, I think I can get
to the end of this game because then I can use my idol
 at the final five. People, like, assume that
 I would be down and upset about my place in this game,
 and yet, I am sitting here with a grin on my face,
so excited to just see
if I am able to, like, just shift these pieces
into place to get the result I want. And so, I'm either gonna smash this out of the water or I'm gonna, like,
flail in the water and drown trying. Bob and weave. Hey, you want to spend part

Let's get to today's immunity challenge.
First things first. Got to take it back, Rachel. Second time. Thank you. Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
you're gonna leap into the ocean and then swim to a platform where you will find a buoy
 attached to a rope. You're gonna maneuver that buoy
 through a series of obstacles
 until you reach the finish, where you will race to solve
 a Survivor logo puzzle. GENEVIEVE:
I know you do, Rachel. PROBST:
First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final five. In addition,
you're playing for reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yeah.
-Yes, badly.
-You'll be taken to... ...the sanctuary. Where good things happen. -Steak.
-Oh. Okay. PROBST:
Baked potato, wine, juice and cheesecake for dessert. PROBST:
You talk about fuel
to get you to the end? This will do it.
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the 13th person voted out, become the sixth member
of our jury. Big enough ""steaks""? -Yeah.
-(mock-laughs) We'll draw for spots,
and we'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward, guaranteed spot
in the final five. Survivors ready? Go! First you got to leap. (Survivors grunting, shrieking) That's how you do it. Now it's a swim
to that platform, and immediately start
working with that buoy. You're maneuvering it
through a series of obstacles as fast as you can. Sam is ripping through it. Sam is over quickly,
out to an early lead. Here comes Genevieve
right on his tail. Here comes Rachel. Teeny with a sloppy fall,
but it's okay. Sue's in the water. It is Sam in the lead. Now you're gonna be putting
that buoy over and under. If this puzzle is close,
every second's gonna count. Now it's Genevieve in the lead. Genevieve moved quickly
through that second stage with the buoy
and she's in the lead. Sam right on her tail. Here comes Rachel and Andy. Genevieve's out of the water. You're good.
Get up, Genevieve. Start working on the puzzle. Here comes Rachel
gaining on Sam now. Andy gaining on Rachel.
Teeny gaining on Andy. And here comes Sue. Everybody's gonna be in this. You got to get up on
the platform and start working. There are all kinds
of puzzles on Survivor. Some puzzles
come easier to others. Sometimes you walk up,
and you go, ""Oh, this puzzle's all mine."" Everybody now working
on this logo puzzle. You've been wearing it
on your Buff all season long. You'll never forget this logo,
you win this puzzle. It is Rachel out
to a very fast start. Genevieve on her tail. Genevieve with another piece. Rachel with another piece. Andy just gonna look next door. ""I'm gonna
let Rachel do the work. I'll just see what she's doing.""
Teeny gonna get in on that. All that means is you're behind. This is turning out
to be a showdown quickly
between Rachel and Genevieve. Genevieve with another piece. Rachel with another piece. Right now, if you were Genevieve
or Rachel, you got to keep busting it, 'cause you got
somebody right on your tail. Genevieve and Rachel are ripping through this puzzle. And another piece from Rachel. Dude. Genevieve with another piece. Now it's Rachel
who feels the pressure. It is Genevieve
clearly in the lead now. Genevieve can feel
that momentum. Rachel trying to catch up. Nobody else even close. You might have more fun
just watching like I'm doing. Genevieve down to six pieces. Rachel about double that. Rachel with another piece. Oh, my God, come on...
(muttering) Guaranteed spot
in the final five on the line. Genevieve down
to two pieces now. Rachel with another piece. Genevieve down
to one piece left. And it's over. Genevieve wins
individual immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final five of Survivor 47. Wow. That was the fastest
I've ever seen a logo puzzle put together. Genevieve, come on over. First individual immunity win guarantees you a spot
in the final five. -Yeah.
-In addition, you've won an afternoon at the
sanctuary, where you are going to fuel your body for that
final push to the end. Choose one person to join you. Already Sam is shaking his head -saying, ""Don't choose me""?
-SAM: Yeah. My stomach
is in absolute shambles, so, do not waste a spot on me on the reward. Let somebody
who hasn't eaten eat. Um, so in that case,
I... I'm gonna take Sue. PROBST:
Come on over, Sue. All right, Genevieve,
you have one more spot. -Teeny.
-Teeny, come on over.
-Yeah. -Yeah, come on.
-Oh, my God. PROBST:
Here's what's gonna happen. Three of you are
going to the sanctuary, three of you going back to camp. Tonight, Tribal Council. somebody will be
the 13th person voted out, become the sixth member
of our jury. It won't be you.
Bring in the boat. (squeals) Limo service. -Fiji limo service.
-TEENY: Yeah! All right, head over,
board your Survivor limo. -Yeah. (laughing)
-Enjoy your afternoon
at the sanctuary. -Thank you.
-Have fun. GENEVIEVE:

Andy, Rachel, Sam,
got nothing for you. Swim out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. RACHEL:
 Genevieve beat me. So, the majority of the votes
are going to fall on me tonight. But I have a Block a Vote, and if I play my idol, Sue and I get to decide who goes home. There is, like,

-Yes. TEENY:
I'll pass on the juice for now. I got.. I got my juice. -Let me know
when anybody wants a refill.
-SUE: Okay. GENEVIEVE:
 My main objective is, have a nice time with
these two women that I have had up-and-down relationships with
throughout the game. I need to convince them that Rachel's the biggest target
 to everyone, and I don't want
 to push too aggressively at this point. I'm voting for Rachel. I see her as the-the biggest
sort of obstacle for me getting to the end. What are you thinking, Teeny? TEENY:
I will never beat her
in a puzzle. I will never beat her in fire, and I kind of want
to eliminate that option. SUE: Genevieve and Teeny
 are going for Rachel, but I know she has an idol.
She's playing her idol. So whoever Rachel and I
 decide to vote for will go home tonight. -GENEVIEVE: Um, I'm gonna die.
-Let Teeny fill up. GENEVIEVE:
I'm not filling up anymore. -Did you put more wine
in our glasses?
-Yes. (laughing) GENEVIEVE:
Yeah. Okay, so when we get back
to camp, what do I tell Rachel? -Oh, yeah.
-I think she knows. That's something I also wanted
to say to you is that, like, when you didn't play that idol,
I was... (laughing): I have
a secret idol that no one... Oh! Hmm. The hypothetical idol
that I don't know exists. Because I had a little red wine
 in my system, I told Sue that Genevieve has an idol. And instantly, I'm just face-palming myself. And I just started to be in good with Genevieve again.
 So, I know I made a mistake. The red wine's talking now. I've revealed myself
 as the 23-year-old I am in that I can't
get a few drinks in me without spilling the secrets that are really,
really important to people in this game. You did good, girl. -Good job.
-Thank you. Teeny has now let my idol secret spill to Sue. I don't care. It's not an idol. But the more people that think it is, the better for my game.
 I mean, I should be thanking you.
This is amazing for my game.
Great job. Keep it up.
 I'll give you a refill here. Tell her more about how real
this fake idol is. Go for it. -(burps) Sorry.
-(laughs) Oh, my... There's an undeniable amount of good fortune
hitting me on day 23. RACHEL: Think you can
beat Genevieve, Sam? No. Why'd you guys
all hand her the ... game? 'Cause I think you both
could have beat me more... better than you could
have beaten Genevieve. And I don't understand. -How do you feel
about your big move, Andy?
-(weak chuckle) SAM:
 It's three Gata members--
 me, Andy and Rachel-- sitting on a beach, day 23. We've all kind of been on this
roller coaster of a game, weaving in and out
of one another, coming after one another,
trying to work in harmony. And so, this is an opportunity
 with Rachel to clear the air,
 to lay out all my cards. Like, I feel like I laid a lot
of my cards out for you because I was looking for, like, who wanted
to play the game with me. I feel like you heard me, but wanted to play
with Sue and Caroline and Teeny and Andy, and I wasn't really
part of your plans. So, I had to find another way to move forward in the game, so... I do think you would
win the game if you got there. It might be difficult for you
to see, being you, but... It is difficult for me to see. SAM:
 Today was the first time
 in the game that I've been very direct
 with somebody about where
 my vote was gonna go. And you're always
hesitant in Survivor to, like, let your target know
that they're your target. That could backfire on you. But in the moment, it just
kind of felt right to me. It felt like the closing
of the book of Gata. It's hard decisions, man. I know. I don't...
None of it's personal. Like, just know that, like, I'm pissed, but I'm pissed
because I'm just like, ""God, this is close."" You know? -Yeah.
-Sucks to get this close. It sucks to...
Yeah, you're right. RACHEL: Just sitting there with these two guys who I've been with
since day one-- it's a little bittersweet. Genuinely, this is a game to me, and it always has been. So... like, I love you guys. We will hang out after this. -(laughs)
-Yeah. And I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at myself. Today was my ... challenge
to lose, and I'm so mad. I'm so mad that I lost it. I knew everything
was riding on it. There's, like, a brotherly sense
 to them, right? We've been here for 23 days,
 but it genuinely feels like I've known these guys
for, like, at least a year or two
at this point. And so, I think today,
 it just kind of all hit. These challenges
are wildly unpredictable. RACHEL:
I know, but it's a puzzle, man. But at the same time,
 it's just kind of this really funny dynamic where I'm kind of, like, playing into my, you know, ""imminent death."" And yet, I know I'm not dying tonight. I'm gonna be
waking up here tomorrow and one of them won't be. (sniffles) (laughs) But if I do not have
 to play this idol tonight, I get to play it tomorrow
and guarantee myself fire, which is even better for me. And so, I want
 to connect with Andy. I want to be real
with Andy, and... I want him to kind of try and
see my perspective and see why Sam is a better vote
 than me tonight. From what I've heard when
people chatter about Andy... Mm-hmm. ...it's never been in the sense
of, like, you're a threat. -Mm-hmm.
-And so, I think
you do have an uphill battle. -Yeah.
-And I think if you and Sam
sat there tonight, -Yeah.
-as the final two,
he would win, hands down. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just think right now, -the perception of you
with the jury is relatively low.
-Mm-hmm. -It's not, like, bad.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But it's also not good. And I think Sam has... ...better relationships, and I think that
 I would lose votes to him, -even if I sat next to him.
-Yeah. ANDY: It's very clear that the conventional
 long-running narrative is that I am not a threat, and Sam
is a threat, and Sam is a threat because he is someone
who can definitely garner a lot of jury votes
in the end of the game. Your superpower is that the way you move around the world
is, like, a little careless, genuinely. And.... because of that, -people underestimate you.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being underestimated
in this game, because you just want
to be out here, and you want to be known
as a capable player. I think
you do have a better story against me
than you do against Sam. You've deceived me
multiple times. ANDY:
I've gained a lot of confidence in my decision-making, but I can kind of maybe
 feel the pressure of how important
this vote is for my game. I'm-I'm pretty sick of lying
to you, though. I don't like it. So, I don't have an answer
right now. Yeah, no rush. ANDY:
 At this point, I need my perception to turn.
 So, I'm closing zero doors
right now. Absolutely zero doors, and
I don't know what I'm gonna do. (laughs) Ca n a bo dy w as h tr an sf or m yo ur c he st , arms, legs? It's Olay Body Wash

Hi. Hi. -ANDY: How was it?
-Good. -Hello, Beka.
-SAM: Hello. TEENY:
Full. GENEVIEVE:
 Coming back to camp, I need to make sure
that the obvious, easy vote of Rachel stays the vote. And the thing
 that worries me is when things feel obvious
 and easy, that's when players think ""maybe now is a good time to do something,"" you know? And I want to make sure
everyone knows, ""Tonight, let's not
 do something crazy. Let's just do Rachel."" -What do you mean?
-You mean she yelled at you? She's like, ""I hope you enjoyed
your move last night."" -Oh, I'm sorry, Andy.
-ANDY: That's okay. It was literally, like,
we sat there and acknowledged the fact
that we were voting her out. -Did you?
-Yeah. SAM:
 Right now, I feel very uneasy. I think
I'm Rachel's target tonight. I think
Rachel's coming after me. She doesn't realize how big
 of a threat Andy is right now, and Genevieve is immune, so, I think if there's
a hiccup tonight, I'm in a lot of trouble. Andy, what are you thinking? -Truth-Truthfully?
-SUE: Yeah. This is the endgame.
I'm weighing my options. Would we be, like, a final three
if I were to vote with you? -Yes.
-We'd be a final three? I mean, we don't have loyalty
to any of those other people. -Right.
-Yeah. And no one else
has given us a bone. Yeah. RACHEL:
I would not vote you out tomorrow if you saved me today. -Mm-hmm.
-I promise you that. You promise? I promise.
Do you promise him that? I promise that I will not
vote you out tomorrow. ANDY:
The logistics of Rachel's pitch
 are pretty clear. With her Block a Vote Advantage,
 you do the numbers, it's not hard to see that Rachel just needs two people
on her side, and she believes
 she has Sue already. So if she could just swing just me,
just little old me, over to her, then we can become the majority
 on a final five. Now... that's interesting. -Yeah.
-RACHEL: I think
that it was clear that you're in dead last because
Genevieve would have taken Sam. She didn't.
She then took Teeny and Sue -and not you.
-Yeah. If I look at this game so far, I've been on a real hot streak, and I've been pulling off
really cool moves that I could sell to a jury. And so, what if I go
 with Rachel and Sue? What if I knock someone out that I've been working with
 very recently? I mean, that's
a pretty bold move. -Yeah, it's a big decision
for me, for sure.
-Yeah. ANDY:
 This decision is, like,
 it's game-breaking if it's not correct. And if I make
 the right decision, I think I'm ready to just keep hitting my stride, and...
and go on to win this game. SUE: You have to. You have to play your idol. I was hoping... -You're not swaying them.
-Okay. -They're all against you.
Teeny's against you, too.
-I believe you. -I promise you.
-I know she is. I was hoping...
Andy's a very rational player. I was hoping by appealing... No, he ratted you out. He just told everybody
what you said to him. Everything. -Don't trust him.
-Okay. SUE:
 My loyalty to Rachel is real, and so, I'm gonna go with
 what she wants to do. Every single person thinks that Rachel is absolutely going home. Yes. -It'll be announced
before the vote?
-No, it'll be when he goes -up to the booth,
it will just say he can't vote.
-Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. SUE:
 Meanwhile, I know she has an idol, and I know she's gonna freakin' burn them so bad. My brain's been going nuts
all day, 'cause I'm thinking,
weighing my options. Um, but... it's best for me
to vote you out tonight. Okay. And I want to say
a couple things about that. In terms of my move last night, I do feel like I have maybe some more information that is influencing
these decisions -Okay.
-than it appears now. And so, I would ask you, as a friend, to keep a little bit
of an open mind to some of the decisions
I'm making, and... Yeah, you'll be on the jury,
but I want... I actually care more
about you respecting me -because I... because of
how much I respect you.
-Okay. RACHEL: I know
I'm not going home tonight, but clearly, everyone thinks
I don't have anything, and so, uh, I allow Andy to tell me all about his game and how he's been playing. I think that there's a lot
that I've done on purpose in this game in which a final Tribal Council
would be a really good venue -to talk about.
-Mm-hmm. I would guess that this approach
 from Andy is coming from a place of jury management. He thinks that I'm heading
to the jury next. And hearing Andy
 kind of talk about himself-- it does give me pause. I started seeing him as more of a threat than I was
giving him credit for. And I wanted to just -say goodbye to you.
-Mm. Andy is trying to win me over, but instead it actually
just made me question whether Andy was a better option to go home tonight than Sam. On the one hand,
 Sam has played a good game. He's also the half of this Genevieve-Sam impenetrable duo, and that's dangerous

All right, let's start with the last Tribal Council. Clearly, a massive blindside. Teeny, did anybody ever get
to the bottom of what happened? TEENY:
Well, there's been
quite a handful of votes in this game where I haven't known
exactly what was going on. And yesterday,
I felt in a state of delirium because I truly
did not understand how Caroline went home in accordance to the plans
that I had made yesterday. And I feel like it was almost an accidental
sort of situation that happened. And I know
that's hard to explain and put a finger on, but that's -how I feel it happened.
-PROBST: Sam, do
you concur with that-- -it was kind of an accident?
-SAM: Yeah, I mean, it feels like there was a lot of
people sort of disconnected on what their role
in a particular plan was. So, like, even those of us
that ended up with our plan coming to fruition
were a bit surprised -at how it came to fruition.
-RACHEL: Jeff, can I call ...?
(laughs) -PROBST: Yeah.
-Andy flipped. -Like, that's what happened.
-Yeah. Like, I don't know why we're
pretending like we don't know what happened.
Like... But I had no idea
that Andy was gonna do it. I'm not saying you knew
that that was the vote, but I'm saying that,
like, you guys were targeting Caroline and Andy was supposed
to vote Genevieve, and he voted Caroline.
So, I don't understand where
the confusion is coming from. Does that line up for you, Andy? I think what the confusion that people are talking about
is that there are plans, and then there's layers
within other plans. -But Rachel was very direct
and simplified it.
-Yeah. Oh, did I flip? Yes. PROBST:
So, Rachel, what was the fallout
in the context of the community, the tribe dynamic? Ah.
What a question, Jeff. Um, maybe if you would ask me a different day,
I would have a different answer. But today was my do-or-die day, and without
winning that necklace, everybody that's
sitting here except Sue looked me in the eye and said,
""I'm voting for you tonight."" ""Like, we have to vote you out
because this and this and this."" And, like, you know, we kind of had a funeral today for me. PROBST:
Andy, is that how
it went down for you? Everybody just told Rachel,
""It's you tonight""? ANDY:
That did happen and, from my perspective... ...I've lied to Rachel a lot. I've lied to Rachel a lot
in this game. I blindsided her three times. We've had such up-and-down
strategic relationship, mostly down, but a really
powerful personal connection. And I look at Rachel and I see an all-around
superb Survivor player. So, I was just
kind of sick of lying to her, even though
it's part of the game. PROBST:
Genevieve, did you share your personal feelings
about Rachel -and why you're voting
for her tonight as well?
-Yeah. And it's because--
and jump in if you disagree-- like, Rachel and I know we are on opposite sides
of the tribe, and neither of us
were going to bend and neither of us
wanted to BS the other. Like, we're like Voldemort
and Harry Potter. We just, like, can't... We're weirdly intertwined, but one of us
has to die, you know? GENEVIEVE:
But I'm not sitting
here counting Rachel out because Rachel's
an amazing player, and something
may still happen tonight. So while we had her funeral, she may rise from the dead
and-and come back, so, -I need to vote for Rachel.
-Sam, how about for you? SAM:
Yeah. Um, I adore Rachel. We've tried to get our games
to align multiple times, and that hasn't happened. And so at some point, you'd say, ""I don't know
if I can work with you, so I have to vote for you."" PROBST:
So, Teeny, was there
any other layer this afternoon at camp or was it just this:
""We're gonna all tell Rachel ""she's too good,
she's going home, and then the community will decide
what's gonna happen tomorrow""? I think a big part
of this decision is having awareness
of your own game and your own strengths
going into this end portion. You know, we have one more vote before it comes down
to fire-making. I know my own skill set.
I know Rachel's. Rachel is going to beat me
in fire if we get there. So, it would be foolish for me to sit next to her
in that position. Sue, did you partake in this? SUE:
Well, I'm-I'm the opposite
end of the spectrum. Just like
with Gabe and Caroline, I am not voting for Rachel. Everybody else
knows that as well. So, Rachel, if this is true,
and it's you tonight, you spent 23 days in the jungles of Fiji. -What do you take from this?
-RACHEL: I mean, this is something that
I've been dreaming about for years, and... it's been everything
I ever wanted it to be. And I think the coolest part
about, like, turning that corner
where I was just allowing myself the freedom
to really play is that I started
to actually have fun. There was, like, a levity to it, talking and laughing
and just slowing down. And as I had a better time, everyone else seemed to respond
to me a little bit better, too. And so, maybe I don't need to pack so much
into my life back at home, and it will be
just as fulfilling, if not more, is really what I've taken away
from this experience. All right, it is time to vote.
Teeny, you're up. ♪ ♪ Uh, you're an incredible
all-around player, entirely deserving
 of your threat level. (reading aloud) ""...return to your seat."" I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

better than attending your own funeral is knowing that you're gonna
wake up alive the next morning. (laughing) I'd like to play it
for myself, please. Thank you. This is a hidden immunity idol. -Any votes cast for Rachel
will not count.
-Wow. I'll read the votes. First vote: Rachel.
Does not count. Rachel.
Does not count. Rachel.

That's one vote Andy. Thirteenth person voted out and

-PROBST: Andy.

I'm-I'm honored. I'm honored. Andy, the tribe has spoken. -Time for you to go.
-Good game. Good game, y'all. -Good game. Good game.
-Bye.
-Bye, Andy. Good job, Andy. Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night. (laughing) I got idoled out in Survivor. But after the start
 I had in this game, I have my head held high. It's just
 an unbelievable transformation that I've had over these 23 days. And I'm gonna take it
with me, you know, for the rest of my life,
and definitely for the better. ♪ ♪ RACHEL:
 That was a huge Tribal for me. I finally was the one that knew what was going on, and basically, no one else did. And it was fun.
Like, I had a blast with it. -That was a great job.
-Great job, Rachel. TEENY:
Rachel with the first idol play of the post-jury phase
of the game. Great job, Rachel. -Rachel...
-How long have you had that? TEENY: Shut up. -Oh.
-Can you explain, though.
-I would love to share, but I also... RACHEL:
 The emotion
 during that Tribal was mostly just, like, glee. We had my funeral procession and little did they know that I had an idol in my pocket, and I would wake up
on this beach tomorrow. My clue was in my French fries
at the auction. -That is amazing.
-RACHEL: Um, I'm very curious
where you got yours. -SUE: What? What?!
-You're frick...
No, you're lying. -SUE: No frickin' way.
-Oh, my God. GENEVIEVE: So... So my idol is totally fake, and only Sam is left in the game
 that knows it is fake. So, I guess the age-old advice of
""fake it till you make it"" can even work in Survivor. You just have to fan
 those flames a little bit, and before you know it, everyone's believing
you've got an idol. RACHEL:
I wanted to have the necklace
today so that I could play my idol tomorrow. You winning today
was my worst-case scenario. -(laughs)
-GENEVIEVE: Well,
I'm sorry, Rachel, but I'm gonna have to try
and win tomorrow now, too, -Um, yeah, samesies.
-because I still have
a Rachel problem in this game. RACHEL:
 Genevieve and I
 have kind of been dancing around each other. We both recognized each other
 the second we merged. I never trusted her and she never trusted me
 because I think like just recognized like, and we just knew that we were gonna
be adversaries in this game. I should not care
about getting firewood. I know. GENEVIEVE:
 Rachel and I don't bother hiding the fact that we want each other out. I definitely look at her as someone who
 I don't want to sit next to. I think she will win the game, and it sounds like
she may feel similarly about me. And so, it really is one
of those situations where this island isn't big enough

she went out? -I mean...
-I mean... Yeah, she might already have it. Let's find out. Day 24.
It's about time we search someone's bag
for stuff. -TEENY: Check the pockets.
-Yeah. Nothing there. Nothing there. As happy as I am to have
made it through Tribal Council, I am so irritated that Rachel
is still in this game. I have been targeting her for days and days now, and she's still here. Got to make sure
there's no surprises. Last night was not fun. Because Rachel played an idol, I have to think
there is one out here somewhere. And I know, for me, I can't let Rachel get it. GENEVIEVE: I don't think
it would be in her bag. SUE: Everyone is thinking that
there is another idol out there, and I'm, like, the smart one,
 keeping my mouth shut that I have a hidden immunity idol. -Yeah.
-She's got it, it'll be on her. SUE:
 This has been my theme
 this whole time from day one. I know everyone's gonna freakin' underestimate me. And none of 'em
would even think that I would have an idol. I freakin' made it
 to the final five with an idol in my pocket. Isn't it crazy?
Isn't this freakin' crazy? She's had a lot of good luck
in this game. -SAM: Yeah.
-She has. If she wins today,
it's, like, damn. I genuinely love this battle
 with Rachel. To have Rachel and I as, like, two sort of similar
professional women in their 30s going
 against each other-- it makes me feel
 really good about season 47 of Survivor. I can't see anything. GENEVIEVE:
 It's a little awkward
 when I have to kind of follow her around camp because if she finds an idol,
it's gonna be a problem for me. So, babysitting Rachel
 feels a little icky. I hate having to do it to her, but I'm pretty open
about the fact that, ""I'm sorry, Rachel.
I have to follow you everywhere and make sure you lose today
and vote you out."" If you find a second idol... I swear to God, Genevieve... It's a fun relationship
we have in this game. The best frenemy
I could have asked for. (laughs)
Mm. Agreed. RACHEL:
 Genevieve and I will be going
 head-to-head, but I'm happy to have somebody that I feel like
I really genuinely respect to, like, showdown with
 in this game. We are going to clash, and we're gonna see
who comes out alive. Here's my question.
If neither of us make it to the end, who wins? Sam. I'm so proud of us. -Final five. Like...
-Twenty-four. 24. I will never get over it
in my life. -Like, this is just insane.
-Crazy. Twenty-four. SAM:
Tonight's the last time
we vote. SUE:
Okay. So, what bothers me is that, last night, -when they both came back,
they're just
-The two-- the two of them -coming back here talking about
how great each other are...
-TEENY: Oh! -Dude!
-SUE: To me, that's--
I can't stand showboating. SAM:
Like, sitting in front
of the other three people being like,
""One of us is gonna win."" -Like they're so confident.
-Like, I was like, ""You're really, like,
that sure that we all suck?"" -Yeah.
-SUE: That's exactly how I felt. ""Do you see that
we're sitting here with you?"" I'm very annoyed
 at Rachel and Genevieve literally thinking
 they're the big threats, they're the big dogs. How they've done this, how
 they've done that, and they're just ready
to duke it out together. There's three other people still in existence here. Like, what about us? They think it's only now a game
between the two of them. -Yes.
-And whichever one of them
gets to the end wins. -SAM: Yeah.
-And I actually just
don't think that's true. Me too. Yeah, it kind of made me mad. Genevieve and Rachel
 have been talking about how they're the two best players, one of them is surely
 gonna win the season. Okay, we'll see about that. If I have anything to say about
it, that's not gonna happen. (V O) D an m ad e pr og re ss w it h hi s me nt al h ea lt h, but his medication caused

arguably the biggest and most important
challenge of the season, because if you
win this challenge, you can't be voted out tonight, which means you can't
be voted out of this game. At the very least, you got a shot at making fire. So, no matter what happens
in the final four challenge, you have that certainty.
Big stakes. -Shall we get to it?
-(all voice assent) All right, first things first,
Genevieve. -Got to take back the necklace.
-Yes, sir. Thank you. Mm... Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
you're gonna race in from the ocean, dig through
 a massive pile of sand to get under a log. You're then gonna balance
 on a wobbly beam while using a long pole
 to stack balls on stands. If your stack drops,
 got to start again. First player
 to stack six balls... ...wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot
in the final four. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the 14th person voted out, become the seventh member
of our jury. Let's do it.
We'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go. For immunity and a spot in the final four of Survivor 47. Survivors ready? Go! First it is a sprint, which on day 24 is
more difficult than it sounds. Look at that-- Teeny and Sam. Here comes Sue,
then Rachel, then Genevieve. Now you got
to dig through that sand. It's a big pile of sand, and you want
to get through it quickly. You know how
these challenges go. Sometimes it comes down
to a few seconds, so every handful
of sand you get matters. Sue is through first. Here comes Sam. -Here comes Teeny.
-(grunts) (grunting) Rachel's through. Genevieve in dead last
through the sand. Now you're gonna
stack balls on stands. You got to approach
from the back, -Whoa, ...
-walk up that wobbly stand, and then gently place a ball and then a stand. -Here comes Genevieve.
-Hate the sand. (grunting)
... PROBST:
Sue has one ball and one stand. Rachel with her first ball
and stand. Here comes Genevieve
with her first ball. -Oh, ...
-These early ones are easy. You got to use these early balls and stands
to train yourself to learn,
""How do I want to stack them?"" Anticipate what's coming, which is six balls total. And just like this game, the longer
you get into this challenge, the higher that becomes,
the more precarious. Sue drops, got to start again. -Oh.
-PROBST: Sam loses everything. Got to clear the whole deck. If you drop,
everything comes off. Genevieve places another ball. Rachel places another ball. Damn. No. PROBST:
It is Genevieve
gonna lose everything. It's now Rachel in the lead. Rachel loses everything.
Now it's Teeny in the lead. Teeny drops.
We're virtually starting again. This is one of those challenges
that's gonna be maddening. -Oh.
-PROBST: You're gonna
make progress, it's gonna drop. But if you're playing smart, you're paying attention
to what you did wrong. Everybody's gonna drop. This is about learning
how to get better at this specific, weird Survivor challenge. Genevieve... places her fourth ball. It's Genevieve in the lead, by a bit, over Rachel. Genevieve on one end,
Rachel on the other. Right now,
in a battle for immunity. Rachel places her fourth ball. Genevieve has her fourth ball
and a stand. So it's Genevieve in the lead,
Rachel trying to catch her. It's another familiar situation. Do you want to press it,
try to catch, or you're gonna wait
for them to fall and just keep with your game? Genevieve placing
her fifth ball. There are only six total.
You've got a fifth ball, -Let go.
-then a stand and a final ball, if you can get it to stay. Rachel places her fifth ball. Rachel loses everything. The smallest vibration
on that platform can do it. -No. I...
-PROBST: Genevieve drops. It's now Sam. Sam drops. We're starting again.
Everybody is in this. You cannot give up.
You got to dig in again. Ugh! Nope. Ah... Oh. Rachel back out
with her fifth ball. Here comes Genevieve
with her fifth. There are only six total. We're back
to a duel on the corners. Rachel and Genevieve have been making more
and more progress every round. That's encouraging,
but it doesn't get you the win. You've got to finish. It is Rachel right now
coming back with her last stand. Then one more ball, and immunity is hers. Genevieve one ball behind. Genevieve continuing to dig, hoping for a drop from Rachel. Here comes Rachel
with the sixth and final ball, guaranteeing her a spot in the final four. Genevieve trying to catch her,
hoping for disaster. It's happened before.
Can it happen again? It would be Rachel's third individual immunity win. PROBST: Here comes Genevieve. She's got two things left:
one stand and one ball. Rachel placing that ball. It's dancing around. Genevieve places
her final stand. She has one ball left. Rachel's placed the sixth ball. Now she's trying
to get that pole out of there without touching anything. Then she has to
get off the stand and back to the platform. Genevieve right on her tail. Rachel trying to keep that ball -Don't worry.
-and stack in place. Can she do it? Genevieve drops
and loses everything! It is now
Rachel's challenge to win. All eyes on Rachel right now. Does she have it? -You go, girl.
-And she does. It's over! -Rachel has won her third
individual immunity,
-So proud of you. -guaranteeing herself a spot
-You did it, you did it,
you did it. -in the final four.
-You did it. Wow, what a challenge. Well done. Good job. Well done, Rachel. Good job. (sighs) Rachel, come on over. Good job, Rachel. Beka woman. For the third time,
individual immunity is yours. Means you are safe tonight, guaranteed a spot
in the final four. You cannot be voted out
of this game. -Thank God, Jeff.
-At the very least, you've earned yourself a spot
in the fire-making challenge. As for the rest of you, tonight the dream will end
for one of you. Fourteenth person voted out,
seventh member of our jury. It won't be you.
Congrats. Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight of Tribal. -Thanks, Jeff. Can I have a hug?
-Of course. Well done. GENEVIEVE:
 I'm incredibly bummed that Rachel has won
 the challenge. Had anyone else won, she would have been
 going home tonight. And now that's not happening. So the best thing
 I can think of is I've got this fake idol that
 everyone is afraid is real. So, it's not over yet.

 Oh, my God. I won immunity
when I needed it so badly. -SUE: That was a tough one.
-I needed it.
I knew I needed it. Great for you.
Great for you, Rachel. Genevieve, you're playing
your idol for yourself tonight? We shall see. RACHEL:
 The last couple days, I've been carrying around
 this rivalry between Genevieve and me. And knowing that she's secure
 tonight with her idol and knowing that I was backed
 completely into a corner, drove me today to get it done. Never in a million years thought
that that would be the case. SAM:
I tried to tell 'em at,
like, the final nine, but nobody wanted to listen
to little old Sam. -(Genevieve chuckles)
-That I was gonna do well? That you were gonna win the game
if we didn't vote you out. RACHEL:
What?! -Yeah.
-You did not. SAM:
Swear. Rachel wins immunity,
 her third win. The most defeating
 of them all to this point. Rachel's got her ticket
 to the final four, and my path to winning this game
got a lot more complicated. If everybody
 believes Genevieve is safe, I'm probably
the most likely target. But I know
 Genevieve's idol is fake, because I helped her make it. And so, as close
 as I am with Genevieve, with Rachel immune, Genevieve has to go tonight. I might be making a million-dollar
mistake right now, but I'm gonna do it anyway. And you might not believe me. Genevieve's idol is fake. -Seriously?
-I-I made it with her. -Seriously?
-At the final seven. We made it on the reward. -Wow.
-So... -So she has...
-She doesn't have an idol? Genevieve does not
have an idol tonight. -A hundred percent confirmed?
-One million percent. I made that thing with her,
and Andy knew that. We showed it to him on the
reward, which got him to flip. That make-that makes everything
make so much more sense. Everything makes so much more--
Thank you for that. SAM:
 I can tell
 Teeny's mind is melting. I see her realize in real time, ""Oh, crap. I've known nothing about what's
actually going on in this game."" I see confusion, I see betrayal, I see fear. And that's kind of the
exact reaction I'm hoping for. I'm hoping that Teeny will feel so betrayed by Genevieve, so thankful to me
for finally coming clean that there will be no doubt
in her mind what has to happen. Genevieve has to go home. TEENY:
 So, we could get
 Genevieve tonight? We probably would have to
convince Rachel and Sue that it really is a fake idol. And then get them
to vote on Genevieve. TEENY:
 Wow! I actually can't even
get myself to think straight. My brain can't catch up to all the things that I need to unlearn about
what I thought was going on. TEENY:
 There was no clue
 under a pizza slice. Genevieve's idol is fake. It was never real. I'm literally
 rewinding the tapes on every conversation
 that I've had... TEENY:
 ...and every opportunity that I've let Genevieve
 trick me and trick me. Me and Genevieve are voting... TEENY:
 And it goes
 all the way back to... PROBST:
Fourth person voted out of Survivor 47: Kishan. TEENY:
...Genevieve voting out Kishan. TEENY:
 I don't understand how they got
the numbers to do you. No.
What is happening? TEENY:
 Then Genevieve decided
 to get Sol out. The tribe has spoken. Why? TEENY:
 Then Sam, Andy and Genevieve concocted one
 of the most intricate missions of this game: Operation Italy... Twelfth person voted out
of Survivor 47: Caroline. TEENY:
 ...fooling me
 and getting Caroline out. PROBST:
The tribe has spoken. TEENY:
 And I fell into every single trap. How could I have been so stupid? If her idol is fake, and I've been granted
the knowledge of that, I would be a fool
not to eliminate Genevieve and end this chapter
of her fooling me with me getting the last word. What if I told you
Genevieve wasn't safe? The idol's fake. Sam told me that Andy,
him and Genevieve made the idol. SUE: You think she told him
to tell you that? -'Cause they're
scamming something.
-RACHEL: Yeah. It's just a little bit fishy. If Genevieve's idol is fake and Sam wants us
 to load our votes onto Genevieve,
 that would leave Sue, myself and Teeny
voting for Genevieve. Which means that if the idol is actually real, and Genevieve plays her idol
 on herself, now whoever
 Genevieve and Sam voted for is voted out. So I should take her, or... Um, let-let's not make
any decisions yet. -I know. I know.
-Let's-let's... -Let's breathe.
-get more information. Mm-hmm. -Let's breathe.
-Yeah. I don't believe it.
 There's a big chance this whole thing is a ruse, and Genevieve's idol is real. But I'm protected tonight.
I have my idol. So myself, Rachel and Teeny
 will make the decision. Genevieve or Sam
go home tonight. TEENY:
 Rachel and Sue didn't buy it. It's hard for any of us
to feel confident in making the call
that we're gonna put all of our votes
on Genevieve. The only thing
 I can think of to do to get to the bottom of it
 is approach Genevieve with all the information I have
and give her the chance to tell me if the idol
is real or if it's fake. -I feel very confused.
-GENEVIEVE: Okay. I feel like I've, like, really been duped in this game, and how wrong my gut
was in so many ways. -Okay.
-Sam told me the idol is fake, and it was in a pitch
to take you out. Okay. And I wanted to bring it to you
to hear what you have to say. It is fake
and I am a sitting duck. Dang it. I really trusted him. I'm incredibly bummed
 that Teeny knows that my idol is fake, but perception is reality. And so, if Sue and Rachel do genuinely believe
 I have an idol and they believe
I'll play it for myself, which means
they will put votes on Sam. I have to write down Sam, and he'll write down me. Or if you want Sam gone, you can tell them
you don't believe him, and then we pile on Sam. TEENY:
 Genevieve confirms it.
 I've got her. I'm gonna be able
to take her out tonight if that's what I choose to do. SUE:
 What's going on, Teeny? TEENY:
 But there is a possibility she could have another
 trick up her sleeve, and they've
 worked out this, too, and it's actually a real idol. -It's ...
-She was calculating out. -There has to be something else.
-She's gonna put one on me. -They want to split our votes.
-Like, you think
it's a real idol? I think it's a real idol. So what do you guys want to do--
vote for him? RACHEL:
Do we just load on Sam? SUE:
I'd like to load on her, and she's either got it
or she doesn't. TEENY:
Oh, my God. I just have no idea -what we should do.
-RACHEL: I don't, either. SUE:
 I believe Genevieve's idol is fake. She's been playing us all along. She's conniving. She's actually brilliant,
 and she's gonna do everything under the sun
to win this. RACHEL:
 Something's going on. They are bluffing us. The fact that Sam
 is pushing this makes me think the idol's actually real. And so, it would be a gamble to vote Genevieve. TEENY:
 We've been duped so many times by these people that I don't know whether
 we vote Sam or Genevieve. My brain is like scrambled eggs
at this point. And that's not necessarily
the best state of mind to be in when making a decision

how much weight I lose. Up to 48 pounds. And changing what happens. Don't take if allergic to it, or if you or someone in your
family had medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia

inflamed pancreas or gallbladder problems. Tell your doctor if you are
experiencing vision changes, taking a sulfonylurea or
insulin, having suicidal thoughts, if
you're nursing, pregnant, plan to be, or taking
birth control pills. Side effects include nausea,
diarrhea, and vomiting, which can cause dehydration and

of our jury. (mouths) All right,
let's start with the challenge. We had another showdown
between Rachel and Genevieve. Rachel, you pulled it out for your third
individual immunity win, which means you cannot
be voted out of this game. You are safe tonight. You have
made it to the final four. At the very least,
you'll be back here making fire. So, congratulations. Thank you. It feels amazing.
(chuckles) -It should.
-RACHEL: Um, yeah. I mean, today, I knew
that if I did not win, I would be
out of this game tonight. PROBST:
Genevieve, you had many chances
yourself to win it, but close doesn't matter. You don't have the necklace.
You're vulnerable tonight. GENEVIEVE:
That I am. And I was trying so hard
to beat Rachel because I view her as such a threat
in this game, and my, like, heart
was crushed when she won. And so,
back to the drawing board, because Rachel cannot
be voted out tonight. Teeny, the last
couple of Tribal Councils have been bananas. Shocking blindsides,
blocked vote, idol plays. And this is the last vote. So, what was it like
this afternoon? TEENY:
I'd actually like
to take it back. Last Tribal, we were
all evidently surprised, besides Sue,
by Rachel's idol play, because before that, the belief that I was under
was that Genevieve was the only person in the game
who had an idol. And I gained
a whole new perspective on this game, and learned some information from Sam that Genevieve's idol
is not real. So, I think there is so much
uncertainty, and the fact that I ever believed the idol
was real makes me question if I should
even believe it's not. Wow. So, Rachel,
this is what happens when you get this deep into Survivor, and there have been a lot of truths
and untruths spread. You no longer
know which is which. RACHEL:
Yeah. Today, we were spinning
with conspiracy theories. Like, ""Genevieve has an idol."" ""Is the idol real?"" ""Are Genevieve and Sam
working together ""to try and get
the three of our votes ""on to the wrong person ""so that they control
what happens if the idol is real?"" And trying
to get to the bottom of what the truth is was the topic of the afternoon. PROBST:
Sam, one of the interesting
parts of this is Teeny says, ""I got all
this information from Sam. I mean, I think
I got information."" SAM:
Yeah. I felt it was in the best interest
of my game to let that information
get out there. And as I've learned
in this game, if you want information
out there, tell Teeny.
It'll get out there. -Wow.
-TEENY: That's a reputation I think I've had
for a majority of my life, and I don't think any of
my friends would be surprised to hear it,
but that's also the way that I've chosen
to play this game. And it's gotten me a seat
in the final five. All I can do
is trust my gut tonight. And right now,
I've never felt more confident that I'm less confident
in what's going to happen. But I'm also sure
that what I do tonight will either lose me the game
or possibly win it for me. PROBST:
So you're certain that you're
completely uncertain? Absolutely. PROBST:
And you are certain that it will either be good or bad? You got it. Genevieve just spun me
around in circles today, like she has many times
in this game and I'm sick of it
and I just want to survive it one last time,
and that's where I'm at. So vote for her. I gave the blueprint. I said,
""Genevieve's idol is fake. We can all vote for Genevieve."" And they don't want
to believe it. -I don't-I don't really know
what the problem is.
-TEENY: Sam, me and you haven't talked. I didn't
say I wasn't voting for her. I'm just... Well, I'm just saying,
if everybody's got a problem with how Genevieve's playing
the game, vote for Genevieve. And that's what I've been told
is happening. -Everyone's voting for me.
-But it's also hard to trust Sam because Sam and Genevieve
work together, and, you know, -come up with crazy plans, so...
-RACHEL: I mean, if her idol is real, and their two votes
vote out whoever they want, -because we all
piled our votes on her.
-Get the picture? Yeah.
It's Survivor. I am sorry people
don't appreciate the spin and they don't appreciate
the stories, but what am I supposed to do?
Just go, ""Okay, game over. You got me""? I don't blame you for doing it. It's not a lack
of appreciation, Genevieve. It's that I also want
to survive in this game. And that's my response to it, is feeling spun around,
but trying to... advocate for myself
and make the best move for me. It's not a lack of appreciation. -Don't take offense.
-Okay. Sam, from the standpoint of the five of you looking
to win this season of Survivor, is tonight's vote
the biggest vote of the season? SAM:
I think they all get bigger. The final three is not really,
like, a future plan. It's, like, reality
because you're forming it. So, yes, each one's bigger than the last. -Concerning?
-No. I'm voting for Genevieve.
Everybody knows. PROBST: And, Sue,
you seem very confident. You're not concerned
about this conversation, either. I... They know where I'm going. And I, so far,
have always stuck to my word. Are we ready to vote? -I'm ready.
-I'm ready.
-I'm ready. Are you ready, Teeny? Couldn't be more ready. I don't know what else
I need to hear. All right, it is time to vote.
Rachel, you're up. ♪ ♪ (sighs) ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, tonight is the last night
you can do so. I told you it was fake. Aw. -All right, I'll read the votes.
-SUE: Jeff? I'd like to say something. I found this immunity idol that I would like
to play tonight for myself. (mouths) -Thank you.
-You're welcome. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast
for Sue will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote: Genevieve. Sam. That's one vote Genevieve,
one vote Sam. Sam. That's two votes Sam,
one vote Genevieve. Genevieve. We're tied.
Two votes Genevieve, two votes Sam, one vote left. Fourteenth person voted out and the seventh member
of our jury: Genevieve. Need to bring me your torch. SUE:
Good playing, Genevieve. -RACHEL: Good game, Genevieve.
-Hugs. Come on, give me one. Sorry for all the spinning. (Teeny mutters) Nice. Genevieve, the tribe has spoken. They have. Thank you for the opportunity. -I had the time of my life.
-Thanks for being here. -Time for you to go.
-TEENY: Bye, Genevieve. -Good luck.
-SUE: Bye, Genevieve. Congratulations on surviving
another stage of this game. You can no longer be voted out. Tomorrow you'll compete in
your final immunity challenge. The winner earns a spot
in the final three. For the other three,
at the very least, you'll be making fire,
which means, Teeny, Rachel, Sue, Sam, any one of you
could win this game. Grab your torches.

 I don't want to just
 be going along with plans. So maybe it's time to stop
 going along with Kishan's plan and make Kishan the plan. Kishan, the tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ TEENY:
 I feel like I don't even know
 what happened tonight. I've been bamboozled. I've been betrayed,
I've been humbled. Walking into Tribal, I was
 expecting the vote to be Rome. But in one fell swoop, uh, I've been blindsided
and I've lost Kishan, who I consider
to be my number one, end-all, be-all in this game
above anybody else. A little bit. I'll be all right. TEENY:
Why? What's going on? Teeny, did you know
about the plan? I did know about the plan. Is there a reason
you didn't tell me, though? Because I didn't have a vote
or any way to control it. ROME:
I thought
you had my back, though. I do, but, like... How can you say that if you know
it's gonna be me tonight and then you don't tell me? TEENY:
 It's hard to say what this means for me
moving forward. You know,
my first thought is, like, ""How close was it to being me? ""How far on the bottom am I? Can I crawl back up?"" I really don't know. Like, can you be
straight-up with me? Was there a debate? Like... No. No. No. No. -I feel that no matter...
-You are right in the middle. You're not at the bottom. Rome and Sol are on the bottom. You and me are in the middle, because they both want
to work with us, and they don't want
to work with each other. Rome doesn't want
to work with me. The idea to vote out Kishan
 was mine, and I knew
 I had to vote him out. It was better for my game. He is the player
that is the threat that you don't see
until it's too late. And I just couldn't
 take that chance. TEENY:
Like... He's pissed off at you tonight.
He's gonna be ... Well, what do I say
to him, dude? Because I didn't come up
with that plan. -No.
-I was told the plan. I was also told the plan. GENEVIEVE:
 At this point, I feel good that I've done the damage
control I need to do with Teeny. And now I have Rome,
who really trusts me, because I tipped him off and saved him
from going home tonight. So, I think
I'm in a good position. Like, from the bottom
of my heart, okay? But I want you to know
I feel freed from the shackles of, like, Kishan being a person
in this game that I have to, like,
make decisions with or be associated with. I do feel liberated. And, I mean, I do, too,
because, like, you know,
when I came into this game, I said that I wanted
to get an alliance, and I want
to do everything possible -to get that alliance
as far as possible.
-Mm-hmm. And so that's why tonight, I was more hurt
by Kishan than anything. I thought that I had
 a solid alliance with me, Genevieve, Kishan and Teeny. So, the second that I heard
 Kishan put my name out there, I knew that that trust with me
and Kishan was out the window, was sayonara, goodbye. And that's why I had
 absolutely zero problems stealing his vote tonight,
writing his name down twice and seeing him
get his torch snuffed. I feel like Teeny
 most definitely feels like she's on the bottom right now, and that's exactly
 how I want her to feel. So, yes, Teeny,
you can be remorseful. You can be, you know, sad that you were left out
 of the vote, but at the end of the day, that trust is 100% broken. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on in! ♪ ♪ Wow. Tuku, Gata,

just for this challenge. -Wow.
-PROBST: You will compete together,
and if you win, you will celebrate together
with the reward. -Wow.
-Wow.
-Oh. -Wow.
-PROBST: All right, before we get to the draw, let me
walk you through the challenge. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race under an obstacle,
 collecting keys along the way. You'll use those keys
 to unlock a ladder. You'll then work together
 to maneuver the ladder until it's free. You'll use the ladder
 to collect five balls from an overhead structure. Race to the finish,
 where you will attempt to land those balls
 into five different targets. First team of seven
to finish wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -(all assenting)

The winning seven will be taken to the sanctuary... -Are you kidding me?

You're gonna barbecue hot dogs. -What?! You're kidding.

And you will also have the advantage of opportunity. The opportunity to hang out

will help you later in the game. Losers, I got nothing for you. You will head back to your camp
and then hope that somebody will share
with you what really went down. -Worth playing for?
-(all assenting) All right, then.
Let's draw for teams. GABE: This reward is something
 totally unprecedented, and the biggest advantage
 of it is you're getting this opportunity
 to really cross-pollinate and mingle
with the other two tribes. If you are blue,
go to the blue mat. If you're yellow,
go to the yellow mat. GABE:
 So, it's huge strategically, because we know how close
 we are to the merge. And any time
 you can get with people who you're not
 very familiar with right now is gonna be invaluable. All right, so let's look
at these temporary teams. For today only, we have Anika, Sol, Rome, Gabe, Andy,
Sierra and Genevieve. Over here in yellow, we have Sue, Kyle,
Teeny, Sam, Rachel, Tiyana and Caroline. So, both groups have members
from all three tribes, which means, if you win,
this will truly be an advantage because, for the first time, you will have a sense
of what's going on everywhere. -Wow.
-Wow. All right, give you a minute
to strategize. -We'll get it on.
Let's do this!
-(whooping) All right, here we go.
For reward at the sanctuary. Survivors ready? Go! First you got
to get under that obstacle, and you are untying bags. Every player is responsible
for one bag. You cannot grab more than one. Once you have a bag,
get to your mat. Once everybody's at your mat,
you can move on. -TIYANA: Y'all got this!
-Good job, team. Everybody funneling out quickly.
Got to get all seven there. Go, Blue! You're good! -Go, Yellow! You're good.
-Come on, come on, come on. Go. Now you're looking
for three keys. -(overlapping chatter)
-PROBST: Once you have all three keys, you can try
to unlock the ladder. You're good, Blue! All right. Go, girl. PROBST:
Yellow, you're good. GABE:
Oh, you're good. You have to untie.
You have to untie. PROBST:
It is Blue in the early lead.
Their ladder is unlocked. Now you got
to maneuver that ladder through a tricky maze. It looks a lot easier
than it is. Do you have the rest? We got it. Yellow has their ladder
unlocked. Yellow has some momentum now. It is Yellow in the lead. Blue is stuck. -That's it.
-There we go. There we go. -Keep pushing a little bit more.
Yeah.
-Yeah. Good job. PROBST:
Yellow can feel it. They have figured this out. Good teamwork, guys. Yellow has the ladder free.
You can move on. -Right here.
-It is Yellow now in the lead. -Down. All right.
-Okay. -PROBST: One person going up.
-(overlapping chatter) PROBST:
It's gonna be Kyle
going up the ladder. -Unclip.
-It's so steady. PROBST:
There's one. There's two.
Kyle can reach three. -Down he goes.
-Now you got to make just one move
to get the other two. Blue still working
on freeing up their ladder. SOL:
Lift up, Rome. There you go. Yellow now increasing
their lead. Kyle quickly unclips
those balls. -Can we drop it?
-Drop it. Do that, do that, do that. That's how you do it
on Survivor. Drop one in every slot. You got two rebounders up here.
Let's go! It's gonna be Teeny taking
the first spot for Yellow. -Just shoot. You're okay.

up the ladder. -Okay, everyone, stabilize.

Blue with one. -RACHEL: You got this, Tiyana.

-TIYANA: Beautiful. -Bucket list.
-Finally. Oh, my God. Ah. We've made it
to the sanctuary. -Yeah.
-(whoops) We arrive at the sanctuary,
and I'm looking over, and I see this big banner that says ""Survivor Social Hour."" -It's a fun sign.
-Yes, it's a great sign. KYLE:
 And it's looking like
 a real good time. I see that there's a cornhole,
 there's sodas. -Cheers!

 And there's a grill
 with some dogs. Oh, the vegan dog! -What?! No way!
-SUE: Kyle! KYLE:
And there is a veggie dog, even, for me, because I'm a vegetarian. So when I seen something
 that I could eat, I lit up inside. I... That's the happiest I've ever
been for food in my life. Come and get it
while the getting's good, guys. Yay! KYLE: But my main thing
 about this is, like, coming this close to the merge,
 this is a prime opportunity for people to start creating
new bonds and figuring out the different cracks
 that exist in other tribes. TEENY:
I feel like we've got a lot
of eating and a lot -of talking to get to.
-Yeah. So we need you
to give us the downlow. -Yeah. I'll fill you guys in.
-SUE: Oh, yeah. -SAM: Do you want to start?
-TEENY: Yeah. So, basically, we get to Tribal,
and I just start getting this, like, weird feeling,
and they all voted together. Oh, damn. I'm sorry, Teeny. So now you feel
like you're on the bottom? TEENY:
I'm just nervous all around. I feel like
this might be my last supper. Like, that's where
I'm at right now. That sucks, Teeny. I'm so excited
 for this Survivor Social Hour. I'm here with Sam from Gata, and we're getting to bond with other people on other tribes
for the very first time. If we hit merge, having as much information
 as possible is gonna be really good for my game. SUE:
So, tell us about you guys. -RACHEL: Yeah.
-SAM: Yeah. It's been weird. We're the weirdest
kumbaya tribe ever. -We go everywhere together.
-Do you really? You don't split off at all? -Not really.
-SAM: We go everywhere together. SUE:
I felt like the only thing
that we heard was that you and Sierra were,
like, sort of running the show. -No. It's crazy.
-RACHEL: Mm. SAM:
 Sierra and I have a very
 secret bond with one another. And so it's really frustrating
to know that two tribes might already
suspect that going into the merge. And that perception is very dangerous for my game. TIYANA:
I'm not gonna lie.
This is probably the best-case scenario
for me right now of the Tuku being here. This is not gonna blow up
anyone else's game. Gabe has been the one looking
for idols this entire time. Like, if anyone's gonna find it,
it's gonna be Gabe, and he's alone right now.
I'm pretty sure he's looking for it at
this current moment as we speak. Oh, shoot. It kind of worked out perfectly
because the one person that I'm a little sketched out
about is not with us. I know that Gabe has
 thrown my name out there, so now I can make sure that Gabe is the first name that
kind of goes to people's heads when they think of people
who are suspicious and that they can't trust
post-merge. It's a perfect play for my game. Gabe threw his idol
at our first Tribal Council. He found... Wait.
He already found an idol? -And he played it.
-What?! TIYANA:
None of us knew
that he had the idol. SUE:
 Tiyana just opens up,
 talking about Gabe, literally throwing him
 under the bus. It was shocking. -I go off of vibes.
-Yeah. No matter how many times,
like, me and Gabe talk, it feels a little iffy. SUE:
 Gabe is basically
 my number one ally. And Tiyana put a target on
Gabe's back 100% for the merge. TIYANA:
Yeah, Sue. Yeah! -SUE: Almost.
-Ooh. That was close. This is, like, my second sport--
cornhole. -Oh. (laughs, whoops)
-Be, like... Oh! -Oh, yeah!
-SAM: Kyle! It's nice. It takes us away
from the game a little bit. -Right?
-KYLE: Yeah. RACHEL:
How do you feel about the people -here on your tribe?
-I think
the people here are good. I think there's still
some personalities that kind of rub each other
the wrong way. Some people go out,
 play a game of cornhole. I decide
to keep playing Survivor. RACHEL:
I haven't talked to Sue at all. She is my number one.
I love to work with her, -and whoever I'm working with...
-Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Amazing. CAROLINE:
 The Survivor Social Hour--
 it was so good. I'm definitely feeling good vibes
from both Teeny and Rachel. Rachel is someone who
I just feel comfortable around. So, do you feel good
with the women? CAROLINE:
I feel really good
with the women. So, I could see us working well
in a bunch of different ways. -Yeah. -CAROLINE: Teeny, on the other hand,
I've already met and established a great relationship
with at the journey. I'm over the moon.
I'm absolutely thrilled. ♪ ♪ SOL: Yeah. ROME: When we lose
 the reward challenge, it is the worst feeling in the world. I would have loved
 to be on that reward, but I had to come back hungry,
 knowing that I'm gonna be eating coconut some more
 and have nothing but water. It was definitely,
definitely rough. ROME:
 But the good thing is,
 with Teeny not at camp, it definitely opened up the door for me to start talking with Sol about potentially
 getting out Teeny. It's just gonna be about convincing him
that he can fully trust me. So, I've got no problem telling Sol everything,
 because at the end of the day, you share knowledge with people. That's how you build trust
in this game. Teeny now has the opportunity
to go talk with everybody, she's got food in her belly. She's gonna be a serious threat
post-merge. And this is the other thing. Teeny did get
a three-way amulet, so, if her and the other two people with the amulets use it
together, it counts as an idol. Fart. I am in complete shock. Teeny has an amulet which I was not aware of. And here's the other thing is, Genevieve has told me before that she doesn't want
to work with you long-term, and she'd rather work
with Teeny. But I want to work with you more
than I want to work with Teeny. SOL:
 After last night's vote,
 I thought that Genevieve and I could
 build something strong. So that was pretty hard. Rome is vomiting information
to me, none of it that I knew. And that's where
I came back to reality. It's like, ""Sol, you don't know anything
that's going on right now."" That sucks to hear. Coming in here, I have over 20 years sales experience. I have been very,
very successful in my selling career,
reading people, convincing people to do things. So, I'm getting a big dose
of humble pie right now. ROME:
 I know that you want Sol out -more than you want Teeny out.
 -GENEVIEVE: Yeah. ROME:
 So, hear me out. Sol, at the end of the day,
when it comes to actions, even though
I might not be fond of the guy, -actions speak louder
than the words in this game.
-Yeah. So, he has shown more loyalty
to us than Teeny. GENEVIEVE:
 Right now, Rome is very chaotic. Even though we only lost
a reward challenge, it's very reminiscent
of the scramble that would happen after losing
 an immunity challenge, which... (scoffs) Yes, he's tried to come for me,
things like that. -But at the end of the day,
he voted with me last night.
-Yeah. He was the one
that brought up Teeny, and I think that that's
our better long-term play. GENEVIEVE:
 Rome is saying that Sol is pitching Teeny
 hard to him. But out of all
the Lavo members left standing, Teeny is the one
 that is just easiest for me to work with, so... Ugh! Oh. -You got me, girl.
-Hmm? -You got me.
-What does that mean? -Rome said that?
-Yeah. That's very different
than what he said to me. -Oh.
-He just said
you were pitching Teeny. -Oh, no.
-That's really interesting. Huh. My conversation with Sol-- I was a little caught off guard. I learned that Rome has been very naughty
and told Sol that I don't want
 to work with Sol long-term. I mean, I know I've said it, we all know I've said it, but I don't want Sol
to know that I have said it. -So, you really weren't
pitching Teeny to him?
-Absolutely not. GENEVIEVE:
 And not only that, but Rome was the one
 targeting Teeny. It's not Sol. So, if he's not
telling me everything, his value to me goes down and his danger level goes up. And at some point,
that will tip the scales, and it won't make sense for me to keep Rome
 in this game anymore, and the scales be tippin'. Ma rs ha ll s bu ye rs h us tl e fo r th e la te st t re nd s, from fashion... Double denim is back. Got it! to beauty,

-SIERRA: We're letting 'em go 'cause I don't think
they can lay eggs in that. ANDY: You don't think
they're gonna, like... (clucks) ...go away as soon...
like, as soon as they come out? Sam and Rachel
 are the ones who go on this Survivor Social Hour. And so, back at camp,
 myself, Sierra, and Anika-- the three of us are hungry. You know, we did not
win any hot dogs. We have no food to speak of. -ANIKA: Are you ready?
-SIERRA: Yup. ANDY:
 And these chickens are, like,
 unwanted members on the Gata beach at this point. -(clucking)
-SIERRA: Hey! ANDY:
 We won this, like, beautiful fishing kit
 a few days ago. Let's put it to use.
 Maybe we can catch some fish, and that would be,
like, a huge morale boost. We're almost at the end! ANDY:
There's a lot of different ways
 to go about, you know,
fishing with this thing. ANIKA:
This is just such a joke. ANDY:
 And nothing's working. ANDY:
 So it was just kind of
 like salt in the wound. It was sort of, uh, kind of a bad afternoon
after a defeat. Damn, that net is huge. Yeah. We get back to camp,
 and Sierra, Anika and Andy are in the middle
 of trying to do something with the net
to get fish, I guess. SAM: But people are chomping at the bit to find out
what the heck happened. Okay, well, here's the deal. Tuku goes
to the second Tribal Council. So, Rachel and I
 sit everybody down, and I, of course,
 left out the fact that Sue actually came forward
and told me, ""We heard that you and Sierra
 are running things back at your camp."" SAM:
 So I asked Sue if they had heard anything
about our tribe dynamic, basically just trying
to play dumb. And then Sue was like,
""Well, we heard that you and Sierra are kind of
running things over there."" And that's what...
I shot that down. -Yeah. Good.
-It's just like, that's... -I'm happy you shot that down.
-And I was like, -""I don't feel like Sierra
and even talk all that much.""
-Yup. I was a little bothered to learn
 that it was brought up that Sam and I were on, you know, the top
and dominating the Gata tribe. This is not good for my game,
 but I have a few options. I know I have Rachel, Anika, and myself--
 the breadwinners-- we're this tight, core alliance. So, first off, Caroline said,
""The women are together ""and we're basically just, like, waiting to see
what to do with the men."" But Sam and I have
a very tight alliance with Andy. ANDY:
I'm sure Sam filled you in. -Right.
-The three of us--
that's secret. -Right.
-That is confidential. SIERRA:
 I feel like
 I could go either way. Can either kick it with the boys
 or with the girls. So, I'm like, ""What is best for my game?"" (sighs) I know I have a lot of power
 right now, but it's kind of stressing me out. TEENY:
I'm not complaining whatsoever, but everyone got one hot dog,
there were no condiments. -It was like...
-SOL: Oh, really? -Yeah. There wasn't, like,
potato salad and that.
-Yeah. TEENY: During
 the Survivor Social Hour, I told the other tribes the entire, whole truth. I told them
 that I was on the bottom and I'm a little bit scared. So, I decide to tell my tribe
a minorly-tweaked version of what I told everyone
at the Social Hour. About our Tribal,
I told them what happened, except for I didn't say
he stole Kishan's vote. Basically, I wanted to make them feel like I didn't give up
 any information. I did not get a chance
to one-on-one talk to Sue, but she seems like a sweetheart. Who else was there? Tiyana. ROME: I feel like Teeny almost got no information when she could have got
way more information. That's just appalling to me, so, there's a lot of red flags
at this moment with Teeny in the game. He told that to your face? Hundred percent. TEENY:
So, the second Rome walks away, Genevieve and Sol
start telling me that Rome went absolutely nuts when they got back
 from the challenge, and that is music to my ears. -And then he goes,
""Teeny has the amulet idol.""
-Okay. -Figured.
-Um... Yeah. TEENY:
 After last night, I was so nervous about
 my life in this game, and now the tables have turned
 a little bit. Because of the madness
that occurred today, I feel like Sol and Genevieve
 finally see the light on what I've known, basically, since the beginning
of this game, which is that
 Rome's unpredictability and manner of playing this game
 is just too chaotic to have, long-term. I want him gone. TIYANA:
I'm not even gonna say ""if."" -When we get to the merge,
all of us...
-Uh-huh. Those guys are scattering,
like, friggin', like... -Like, I swear to God.
-KYLE: Yeah.
Oh, they're running. SUE: We come home, and I felt horrible knowing that Tiyana put a target
 on Gabe's back in front of the whole Social Hour. TIYANA:
I'm just gonna hop
in the water really fast, then -I'll go crabbing.
-Yeah. And then, also,
cutting up coconuts for Gabe. And I want him to do,
like, literally nothing. SUE:
 I think Tiyana did it
 intentionally so that others will look at him
 as a threat. So, if she can't take him
out with us, she wants him gone. And that makes me pretty upset
 because he's basically my number one ally. CAROLINE:
 My strategy right now
is trying to keep options open, but Tuku is falling apart. It's looking
more and more likely all five of us might be
making it to the merge. And I'm just thinking,
 ""How can we work together?"" CAROLINE:
 My fear is that Gabe has all trust gone
 with Tiyana because she threw him under the bus. I'm trying to be the mother hen and help us all form
 a cohesive, wonderful family. And they're all running away. And I'm like, ""Let me try
 to get one back in the coop."" I want her to tell Gabe the full truth. 'Cause I'm worried about Gabe
finding out about it. -About?
-About what you said. I just don't see a world
in which if he's at the merge, he doesn't find out
about what happened. 'Cause I'll be honest.
I don't know if Gabe will trust you
after this. TIYANA:
 Caroline suggested to me that I come clean with Gabe. I didn't feel, in that moment, that I needed to apologize, but if I ignore their advice, no one will trust me
 because they know I'm not listening to them. TIYANA:
 So, if Caroline wants me
 to apologize to Gabe and it would make Gabe
feel happy, it just seems like
the right thing to do. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. GABE: Tiyana said that she had
 a private conversation with two other people, that I played the idol, but I don't believe it
 in the slightest. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. But I also wanted
to be completely honest. -That was it. Like...
-Uh-huh. The whole time, I'm just like, ""Mm-hmm."" -Uh-huh.
-""Yeah."" -Yeah.
-""Okay."" -Okay. -Tiyana, I've never once trusted anything
that comes out of your mouth. It was just that
I played the idol, it wasn't anything about, like,
my game or anything? -No. I literally only told
-Okay. -Rachel and Teeny about that.
-Uh-huh. Okay. -Don't worry about it,
we're totally cool.
-Dude. Gabe. We're totally cool.
Don't worry about it. -I really am, like, so sorry.
-No worries. Uh-huh. I get my BS apology from Tiyana. That doesn't make me feel good. I-I think if Tiyana was not
compelled to apologize to me, then she would not have. -Mm-hmm.
-She said that she only talked to Rachel and Teeny, and it was in a private
conversation with them that she said that
I played my idol. GABE: I'm angry at how open and brazen Tiyana was about
 throwing my name out there. But I've been ready
 to cut Tiyana out for a long time. I want
 to crush her Survivor dreams. I want to watch her torch

Got all three? Huh. -SIERRA: All three, Jeff.
-ANIKA: All three. Hmm.
This gonna be interesting. Well, let's just start
with the obvious. Are they family members

-PROBST: Okay. popped out, in two and a half
days, three eggs. Two of them shattered
before we could even get to 'em. 'cause they just pop out. PROBST:
So, first of all, Sam,
is the reason you've not chosen
to eat the chickens a moral decision? Uh, not everybody
was comfortable with the idea
of eating the chickens. -Okay.
-SAM: So, you want to make sure everybody's comfortable
on our tribe. Eating the chickens--
not really an option for us. And they kind of suck
at making eggs. So you're saying
you want to trade -the chickens for eggs?
-Correct. -SAM: Yes.
-PROBST: Okay. -What's the offer?
-SAM: I think two dozen
sounds pretty good, Jeff. PROBST:
So, 24 eggs. Okay. On Survivor, we see the chicken as a dilemma in this sense: you can eat the chicken or you can use the eggs
from the chicken. Those eggs are gonna
be hatched over 16 days, so that's a little bit
like winning the lottery, and you get paid
a little every year. You want to put all your eggs
in one basket. You want to get paid right now. That comes at a reduced price. So, you're asking for 24 eggs, which is eight per chicken. I'll counter
at five per chicken. That's 15 total eggs. -Twenty.

great negotiating, but I'm willing to do it.

Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize.
We'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! First, you got to drag that bag to your first mat. Yep, yep, we're on it. -Go. Hey, go, go, go!
-You're good, you're good, -you're good.
-SUE: Good job, guys! Now you're gonna saw a rope. We've got Kyle for Tuku, -Sol for Lavo,
-Nice, Sol. Andy for Gata. Come on, Gata! Let's go, Andy. RACHEL:
Turn it around, turn it around. -SAM: Flip it.
You need the blade.
-SIERRA: Yeah, that one. -There you go.
-(panting) Kyle working it for Tuku. -Come on, baby.
-Yes, Kyle. Kyle has his for Tuku. Good job, Kyle. PROBST:
Now you got
to get all your coconuts and your sandbags into your bag. -Don't throw them so hard, guys.
-Okay. -Yeah. There it is, Sol. Go!
-Go! Go! Sol has his. Andy, still working for Gata. Keep cutting, Andy. -Aah! Aah!
-Come on, Andy! -ANIKA: Good job!
-PROBST: Andy struggling. -SAM: Come on, Andy.
We need you, bud.
-(grunting) -Let's go.
-One, two. PROBST: Tuku thinks
they have all their sandbags. -You're good!
-We're good. Hurdle.
Hit it hard, hit it hard. -(grunting)
-PROBST: Tuku in the lead,
still. Tuku at the second stage. SUE:
Come on, guys! PROBST: Got to get
all the coconuts in that bag. Try to get as far back
as you can. -All right, we're good.
-Lavo, you're good!
-Go! -(groaning)
-PROBST: Those bags are heavy. -Andy still working.
-SIERRA: Keep pushing, Andy! You got this. -(grunting)
-PROBST: This is a huge
early setback -for Gata.
-You got it. PROBST:
Gata has theirs! Finally. They got a lot of time
to catch up now. -Help put them in the bag.
-SIERRA: I need help! Once you have all the coconuts,
you can move on. Go. Tuku, you're good. GABE:
Hit it hard, hit it hard,
hit it hard! (grunting) PROBST:
That bag is very heavy now. One, two, three, pull! Tuku doing a nice job
working together. One, two, three, pull! It is Tuku in the lead,
then Lavo. Rome, help him lift it. -PROBST: Gata has a lot of time
to make up.
-Let's go. -One, two, three, pull!
-One, two, three, pull! Tuku now can empty the bag. -Sandbags in the...
-I'll organize it. Yup. I got coconuts. -(grunting)
-Everyone watch your step. PROBST:
Let's go, Lavo!
That bag is heavy. (grunting) Gata, you're good. Let's go! ANIKA:
Gata, you got this! I believe in you! PROBST:
Let's go, Gata. You're in this. SIERRA:
Keep pushing. Tuku with a huge early lead. Lavo trying to close the gap. Almost there. Five more steps. PROBST:
Once you have every sandbag, then you can start
knocking down your puzzle wall. -That's it.
-Good.
-You're good! Go, Tuku! -Toss it, Caroline. Go.
-I got it. I got it. PROBST:
Anybody can throw. Tiyana up first. (grunting) -Oh.
-Kyle with a toss. It is Gata working
at the second stage. Shoving 'em. PROBST:
Kyle with a big arm. There's a couple of blocks
for Tuku. Good job, guys. You're good, Lavo. It is now Lavo that can start
breaking down their wall. -Got it!
-PROBST:
Kyle with another nice toss. -Nice, Sol!
-PROBST: Sol, wow! Sol knocks five blocks
completely off. And Gata is still
inexplicably working at the second stage. PROBST:
There goes Tiyana. Nice toss. SUE:
Yeah, Tiyana! -Yeah, Sol!
-Sol with another big hit. -Yes, Rome!
-PROBST: Rome with a nice toss. We are neck-and-neck. -Yup.
-Yeah, Sol! Sol with another one. And now it gets harder
to get those bottom blocks off. -Yes!
-Yes, Gabe!
-PROBST: And Gabe for Tuku with a nice hit.
There goes Rome. They're moving them slowly. You have blocks blocking
the blocks. That's a problem. Tuku, you're good.
Start rebuilding. -SUE: Come on, Tuku!
-PROBST: Now you got to get all your pieces back
on your mat. -ANIKA: Go, Gata!
-Push! PROBST:
Gata finally out
of the second stage. Push, dig deep! PROBST:
You're good. Now unload. ANIKA:
You got this, Gata! PROBST:
Tuku working on putting
their puzzle back together. PROBST:
But Lavo has hit a roadblock. It's gonna take a big gun
to move those blocks, 'cause they are jammed up. -Got to get 'em off that table.
-We're so close. -Let's go.
-PROBST: You're good, Gata.
Let's go! Big gun from Sam
knocks off four blocks. Sierra with a nice rocket. Gata's made up a lot of time. It is Lavo slowing down now. That's okay. We can do this. Come on. Everybody's in this now,
'cause we're looking for two. You got this, guys,
you're in it! Another gun from Sam. So frustrating. -Yup. Good. That's it.
-Yup. PROBST:
Tuku with a huge lead right now. -Ready?
-Yup. Yeah.
-Yes. Here comes Sam again
with another toss. Lavo, keep working. They cannot -be touching the frame.
-TEENY: Yeah, Sol! PROBST:
Here comes Andy. SIERRA:
Yeah! -Andy did it! You're good!
-ANIKA: There you go, Andy! A huge comeback from Gata. -One more, one more.
-There goes Rome. -(cheering)
-PROBST: You're good! Let's go, Lavo! -And then this one.
-Yeah. PROBST:
Tuku with another piece,
getting closer. (whooping) You guys ready? -Double-check.
-Jeff! Jeff! -Jeff! Jeff!
-Tuku thinks they have it. -And they do!
-(cheering) Tuku wins immunity,
safe from Tribal Council. -Oh, my God.
-Hey, hey. Lavo and Gata--
they are literally starting on this puzzle
at the exact same time. -This is top left.
-Yeah, that's right.
-Nice. -PROBST: Immunity on the line.
-Yeah, perfect. PROBST:
Somebody going home tonight. Player number five of Survivor 47, say bye-bye. -Face 'em all
the right way, Si. Don't...
-I... They're the right way. No.
Like, this needs to face us. -Yeah, but she needs
to be able to see.
-Hey, no fighting. Gata was dead last
but once again, a huge comeback. Fighting to stay alive
in this game. RACHEL:
Wait, wait, wait,
gimme that one back. I can't see the puzzle if we're facing the pieces
upside down and sideways. -That's it?
-Yeah.
-Yup. Lavo with another piece.
We are still neck-and-neck. You're so close, you're
so close, you're so close! I think something else is wrong. -SOL: Yeah. Yeah.
-There it is. There it is. -Wing needs to go on this side.
-PROBST: This is gonna -come down to the wire.
-ANIKA: You got it, guys! -That's right. That's right.
-ANIKA: You got this! Quick, quick, quick! -One more.
-Jeff!
-Jeff! Lavo thinks they have it.
Get back to your mat. Put it back. Put it back. -Go, go, go!
-Move!
-Sol falls. There you go. You got it. That's it. That's it. PROBST:
You're good! (cheering) Lavo pulls it out
in the last seconds over Gata... ROME:
Oh, thank you! Oh, my God! ...sending Gata back to Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 47. Oh, my gosh. (cries) That was tight. -Wow.
-Wow. PROBST:
Lavo, big, emotional win. Rome, tell me -about the emotion.
-ROME: I mean, we knew coming into today that we're the only tribe where the majority
of us hasn't had anything but coconut
the last six days. We came in knowing that
we're gonna be super low energy, and we just told everyone,
""Just give it our all. ""Just put your whole heart
into it and don't give up, ""no matter how hard
it might get. Just power through
and try to not go to Tribal."" And the fact that we were able
to do it today, it just shows us why you never
give up on Survivor, Jeff. All right, Tuku, congratulations. Immunity is yours. Nobody going home
from your tribe. Lavo, big win indeed. Immunity is yours. And you get your flint back. Let's go. We got fire, man.
Thank you, Jeff. Most importantly, nobody
going home from your tribe. Tuku, grab your stuff, head out, enjoy the night off.
Nobody going home. SIERRA:
Great job. Great job, guys. Lavo, grab your stuff,
head out. -Enjoy the night off from me.
-Thank you. (Teeny sighs) PROBST:
So, Rachel,
the afternoon started off pretty well.
We had a nice negotiation. Eggs waiting for you
back at camp, but the result is -Tribal Council.
-And no way to cook the eggs. The great irony of having -18 eggs back at camp.
-Oh, shoot. Because I'm gonna
take your flint. -You're gonna take our flint.
-All right, Gata, Tribal Council tonight,
where somebody will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing, I will take that flint and your ability to cook. -(sighs)
-All right, grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. -Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff. ANDY: This immunity challenge,
 uh, was a tough one, and after ten days out here,
I can conclude I'm not good at challenges. So, tonight, it could be me. I've been on the bottom for a very long time
 in this game, but I've laid a lot of groundwork
on what could happen if we were
 to go to a Tribal Council. And I feel like this is
 the real start of my game. I'm looking forward to tonight. ♪ ♪ Irresistibly smooth chocolate. To put the world on pause. LINDOR.

 The challenge was a total flop. We rode the high
of our chicken negotiation all the way down to rock bottom. No, it's okay. Just for my part. SAM:
 Andy, once again, can't seem to get out of his own way
 in a challenge. At one point,
Andy is sawing the rope with the non-saw part of the saw. You come that close to immunity and then your mind goes,
""Huh. Would have been nice if we would have sawed that rope
just a little bit faster."" ANIKA:
 I can't stop thinking about how much
 I want to cook those eggs. -SIERRA: Yup.
-This is the only morning since we got here
that we didn't make a fire. -SIERRA: That sucks.
-Yeah. ANIKA: The fact
 we were able to negotiate for 18 eggs is so major. The only downside is that
 we lost the immunity challenge and had to give away our flint, and therefore, have no fire. -Wash off?
-Yeah. I'm down for that. ANIKA:
 There are multiple times
 throughout the challenge Andy made it harder for my tribe
 and not easier. I like Andy as a person, but I think our tribe
 will be genuinely better off without Andy here. RACHEL:
This shirt is so nasty, no matter how much I scrub. I'm gonna pee. -I'm gonna go this way.
-You pee. ANIKA:
I lost my vote on a journey, but even though
I don't have my vote, I am not worried because I know
 where my alliances lie. So, I'm sure
 Andy is going home tonight. ANIKA:
Yeah, me, too. SAM:
Andy is definitely a little bit of a liability, challenge-wise, and it is super,
 super frustrating. But, long-term,
 I don't trust Anika, so, I want Anika out of here.
I-I'm ready for her to go. ANDY:
I feel in danger tonight, so, whoever extends a lifeline
is the person -I'm ready
to be loyal to in the game.
-Yeah. -Does that make sense?
-No, it does. -Yeah.
-Like, numbers. ANDY: After all my efforts,
 I truly believe that Anika is buying what
 I'm selling, that she believes that I truly feel on the bottom. Oh, it would just be...
It would feel so good to, like, you know, be a part
of the group. (laughs) -You know what I mean?
-Yeah. Yeah. ANDY:
 My alliance with Sam
 and Sierra is top secret, and I think that Anika
 is very, very confident and very sure about
 what's happening tonight. Suffice to say, I think
she underestimates people, and she underestimates me. -I don't feel secure tonight.
-Yeah. So, yeah, I'm-I'm
a free number right now. I'm a completely
free number, so, if at any point today
you're like, -""I need a number for this,""
-Yeah. -you just let me know.
-I mean, I appreciate that. -Yeah.
-And, like, -I don't know
what's happening yet.
-Okay. I know my role. I have a very
specific role to play here if we're gonna blindside Anika. If there is some plan out there,
let me be a part of it. (laughs) Here's how my plan works.
 I want Anika and Rachel to see me as someone feeling
very much on the outs, which they believe I am. So I say to Anika and Rachel, ""Pull me into your master plan.
I will be so loyal to you."" I want them to respond to that and be like, ""Okay,
 the best thing that we can do ""to prevent Andy from playing
his Shot in the Dark is to feed him a fake plan."" RACHEL:
So, since Andy is so eager to be part of a plan,
then we sell him one. SIERRA:
I feel like it'd be believable that we were trying
to get Sam out, -Yeah, I agree.
-'cause we're trying
to keep the girls. I go back to camp,
and then pretty soon after... ANDY:
 ...Anika and Rachel
 pull me aside. They're like, ""Hey, Andy, come here,
come here, come here."" Yeah. Well, just lay it on me, please. Please, yes. ANDY:
 They do exactly
 what I expected them to do. They're giving me a fake plan. It is the name that I expected:
Sam. Yeah. I'm in. I'm in. I was very well prepared
 for that, because I set it up. I set up that conversation.
They don't know that, but that's
exactly what happened. I'll act completely natural.
You can trust me with that. -Yeah. -ANDY: They're believing exactly what I'm feeding them, hook, line and sinker. I feel like I have all my eggs
 in the right basket right now. I just got to boil 'em. (laughs) SIERRA:
 Dude, why am I sitting here, like,
over and over in my head, making sure that
we're making the right decision? We are doing the right thing,
I'm a million percent sure. Anika getting out is the thing. -I'm looking at her in her eyes,
and I'm like...
-I know. I feel like a piece of crap. -You... I know you do.
-I mean, what the hell
am I gonna... SAM:
 I think right now,
 Sierra and I are just trying to figure out how to navigate as a pair when both of our individual interests
might be slightly different. Sierra really wants
 to keep Anika around. I know how you're feeling
about looking into her eyes, but, like, this whole, like, ""Ani is your best friend"" thing is her game. That's what
she's trying to play. I really want
to keep Andy around, but Sierra is my number one. So we have to find a way
 to keep each other calm while we figure out
what the heck we're gonna do. Are you, like,
100% sure Ani can't vote? -Ani 100% can't vote.
-Okay. SIERRA:
 Going into Tribal tonight, Sam and I--
we have to get on the same page. He wants to keep Andy, but is keeping Andy the best for my game?
I know it's probably best for Sam's game,
but is it best for mine? -SAM: I have to figure out
what to do with the idol.
-Your... -'Cause everything...
-That's the thing. -Keeping Andy.
-(Sam stammers) He's now gonna
lose a little trust. He's gonna be like,
""Why did you keep that from me?"" -Yeah.
-That's a target on your back. 'Cause he's gonna
tell other people. I know he would
tell other people that. You know that, like, for me,
that's a huge risk. My hidden immunity idol is only
good for my next Tribal Council, which means
it's only good tonight. I have to play it tonight,
but that creates some fireworks. If I play an idol and I've kept it from Andy
 this entire time, how does that impact
my relationship and my trust with him
moving forward? So, maybe the safe move
 is voting out Andy tonight. But I've wanted Anika
 out of the game for a long, long time. Basically, it comes down
to what Sierra and I want to do, who we want
 to take with us further. So, tonight, that's all the power. Yo u al l ha ve a l ot o f mo ne y. I know about 20 of you and you're rich as hell. We're going to

and talk about the Social Hour reward. Rachel, you were a part of that. What was the most interesting
thing that you learned? Yeah, I mean, we learned
about a few of the dynamics that happened at Tribal. We learned that
Gabe played an idol at the first Tribal Council. That was shocking to us. -SAM: Yeah.
-RACHEL: We also learned
Teeny was blindsided by the Kishan vote. So, yes,
they could be lying, but those would be kind of
weird things to lie about. Sam, what do you think
was the impression -they had of your tribe?
-I mean, I think they bought, like,
everything that we said. We kind of tried
to not give too many details and just be ""Gata the
listeners,"" in the background. PROBST:
Andy, what do you think
about how Sam and Rachel did as spies going out
to get information? I mean, I think
they did an excellent job. I trusted them completely
because we've talked a lot about managing our perception
to the other tribes, and there's a very clear picture
to paint that I'm on the bottom as a result of my
emotional moment on day three at the challenge.
I said things that were, uh, explosive, you could say, but I've made so much headway,
especially socially. I don't think, at the end
of the day, people really care how good I am at a balance beam or sawing a piece of rope. -Well, your tribemates care.
-ANDY: True. True, true. That is...
It's important, but I think what's more
important to my tribe is getting to learn, you know,
what I am made of on the inside, and I-I like what I see. PROBST:
So, Rachel,
this is setting us up nicely for the conversation
about tonight's vote. Who do we vote out and why? RACHEL:
That's the tricky, tricky part of Survivor, where you have to weigh out the pros
and cons of each person. Like, this person
may be really emotional, and they wear their heart
on the sleeve. That could really help you or it can really hurt you,
you know? And so, I wish
I knew the answer, Jeff. -Very tricky.
-(laughs) PROBST:
Sierra, where
do you sit with this? SIERRA:
I mean, I think
it's great to keep individuals who you trust,
you form bonds with, because going into a merge,
which can be a shaky situation, you want to feel strong and
comfortable with your alliances. But I also think
there's 100% a benefit of keeping somebody
who is not exactly as ""liked"" and fitting in
and gelling with the whole crew because to me, that's a person you want to keep around
because, you know, that's somebody
that's an easy number out come later on in the game. PROBST:
Anika, how about for you? Every Tribal decision
each one of us makes creates a completely
different pathway for our own personal game. There could be
eight billion diff... Well, actually, in this case,
five different pathways. Okay, there's
five different pathways that you could possibly
take in this game, and tonight
we are going to find out which is the next pathway
we decide to take. PROBST:
Rachel, one big word
in what Anika just said. ""We.""
What is your sense of confidence in knowing who the ""we"" is,
and that -you are a part of the ""we""?
-RACHEL: I mean, I believe that the ""we""
that I established today, like, is the ""we."" You know?
And I-I look around, and I... meet the eyes of the people
that I believe I... I'm working with,
and I feel confident about that. But having cohesion
coming out of this vote is the most important thing. And so tonight is about
solidifying the alliance that I want to be in
come the merge. PROBST:
And Sam, what Rachel says
seems simple. Four people get together
and you vote out one person, and you four are in harmony. But it's not always easy. So is there some fear that maybe we don't come out of this with -everybody in harmony?
-SAM: Yeah. Cohesion is not always
a guarantee, but I feel confident tonight that my ""we"" is going to be
cohesive after the vote. PROBST:
Anika, how confident are you that are part of the ""we""? ANIKA:
It is so silly, but I also think that I'm also hopefully
in the ""we,"" and we'll just have to see. Andy, how confident are you
that you're with the ""we""? Yeah, for right now, tonight,
I'm trying to turn the ""me"" into a ""we.""
I'm trying to build this vote
to be the one vote where I really feel like I've entered into a group
of people that I can trust. And if I can survive, then, yeah,
now I'm part of a ""we."" I'm nervous for sure, but I feel like I have a... a shred of hope. And I just want to sort of get to it and, you know,
sort of see my fate. (chuckles) PROBST:

 Tonight, both Andy and Lavo flipped on Gata. It was a brilliant acting job, like, across the board. These people had me fooled, and right now, their only mistake was keeping me in the game. That Lava group is a bunch -of very, very good liars.
-Yeah. SAM:
 And then, I don't even
 want to look at Andy. SAM:
 Yeah. But I just... I don't know where
to go from here. Like, I don't know who to trust. I kind of had this gut feeling
throughout Tribal that there's something going on, but I didn't know what. And so, I played
 my Shot in the Dark. Not safe. Any votes cast for Rachel
will still count. RACHEL:
 I played it
 to gauge the reactions of everyone at Tribal
 to see if they were looking worried or surprised. And based on the reaction
that everyone had when I played
my Shot in the Dark, I did not feel like
I was the vote, and I didn't play my idol. We just got to play our own individual game and try to do what we can
for each other. Moving forward,
 I'm willing to work with just about anyone
 that will have me. I don't have a lot of options.
(chuckles) Um, my door is open,
I'm taking calls. We'll see who comes knocking. It was nice that we all stuck
to the exact plan, though. I want to say that. -Yeah.
-Yes. -Yeah.
-Yeah. Andy, thank you
for voting with us. It was a team effort. Yeah. After this vote, I'm a certified flipper. I flipped on Gata, and I feel like
this is the first step of me taking my fate
into my own hands. And so, the only thing
 I have to do at this point is damage control with the Gata members
who are left in the game. From my perspective,
we come to the merge, and I feel like I was left
to my own devices a bit. -Okay.
-So... I wanted to better my position
in the game. Since the start of this game,
 I felt like I was the outcast. I feel like I was on the bottom,
and I was sort of an expendable piece. And so, now,
 for me to be the one to get one over on all
 of my original tribe members, like, it's complete Survivor satisfaction. Not everyone gets
to feel that... that chef's kiss that I have flipped the script. Today, the target was square
on your back, and I spent some social capital
I just gained to make sure it was Sierra
and not you. Going all the way back
 to day three after the immunity challenge
and the moment I had on the mat, I fell on the bottom
 of my tribe, I succumbed to paranoia, and I thought that was just
gonna be it for me, and that was gonna be my legacy. -I appreciate it.
-All right. Yeah, dude. And so, I feel like
 I've been given the biggest second chance you could ever have
in this game. I am learning every day
 out here, and have just a huge amount of just
overall gratitude that... that this is my story,
and it's continuing, and I'm still getting
to write it. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ RACHEL: Dude. It was Sierra, predominantly, that was like,
""We could do Andy."" -Ah-hah.
-And then, I was like, ""I am not putting
Andy's name down again."" ANDY:
 Rachel and I have both been
 on the bottom, and so, I feel like
 if I were to have a future with any of the Gata members,
it would definitely be Rachel. But the stars have not aligned for various reasons. I'm not gonna lie. That little chain of events... did make me lose trust -in Gata.
-Yeah. I feel like
 Andy and I have kind of orbited each other
this entire game. And we've, like,
wanted to connect, and then not wanted to connect and we just kind of, like,
 ping-ponged off each other for a long time. It was like a rock
and a hard place for me. -So I'm sorry, and...
-That's completely fine. -I want you in this game.
-Yeah. I wanted you
in this game the entire time. I feel like we should be working together
in this game. That was my plan on day one. -Yeah.
We're-we're in alignment. -We're synchronized.
-I agree. I'm like,
""You're strong. I'm strong."" -Yeah.
-I feel like it's good. There were points in the game
where I was like, ""I kind of want to work
with Andy, but, like, oh, he's frustrating to work with."" You have to be careful, though. I totally... I'm so sorry.
It's just that... I just... ANDY:
 Rachel didn't feel
 the same way about me, so I was leaning in to my role,
which was the bottom player. Yeah. I'm in. All right. Fifth person voted out
of Survivor 47. ANDY:
 I blindsided Rachel
 on the Anika vote. Anika, the tribe has spoken. RACHEL:
 Andy blindsided me
 at the Anika vote and then he blindsided me again last night.
 And so, I feel like
I'm climbing a sand dune and every step I take up,
I slide two steps down. Despite all this, it's like, I've always felt
the same way about you. Like, we should probably take this opportunity
to, like, actually... Okay, can we, like... -Work together?
-Maybe we can work together. -Actually work together? Yeah.
-For real. Throughout this game, I've definitely broken trust
 with Rachel, but I do like her. I feel like we have chemistry, and we could definitely have
game chemistry out here. I feel like,
given the game board, I feel like you are an absolutely key relationship
for me right now. -Oh, Andy.
-I know. Is there anyone
you're really wary of? Oh. -There's Kyle
with the challenges.
-Yeah. Sue and Caroline,
like, don't like him. -They wanted him out forever.
-That's true. -That's true.
-He just won't lose. We've had a rocky road,
 but we're finally in a place now where we can
 maybe start to kind of, like, come together and be like, ""Hi."" Like, ""Hello. I'm..."" Like, ""I'm Andy."" ""I'm Rachel."" And it's like, almost like we can start over and, like,
 reform something and work together on some votes. I still have some sort of life
 in this game. Me rr y Ch ri st ma s Thank you (♪♪) It's that moment It's a gift It's so fluffy When a wish becomes true. A present for me? A person feels seen. I just thought God forbid

 I just want to say sorry. -Like, I know it sucks
 -SAM: Yeah. to, like, be blindsided
like that. I feel like it was... We're... From our standpoint,
kind of like, uh, Tuku wanted
to split you and Sierra up. -Mm-hmm.
-Like, thought of you guys
as a power couple, and that was really hard,
and I'm sorry. And I know how it must feel. I hope that there's still a way we could, at some point,
you know, come together. SAM:
I'm ready to play. I have a vendetta against Lavo. We thought we were working
with Lavo and, turns out, we never had Lavo. So, I'm ready for them to feel what I had to feel last night. -I want to pick myself back up
and, you know...
-For real. -'Cause, like, I really want
to play with you guys.
-SOL: Right. SAM:
 But I need to play along, at least for now, and then come
for my revenge later. I wasn't turning my back
on Sierra. I think everybody
knew that. Um... So, something had to be done
about that, from everybody else's
perspective, I get that. SOL:
 I was a part of that
 blindside against Sam, but I like Sam's mentality. He's not getting emotional,
he's not getting pissed. TEENY:
Did you and Andy mend fences,
or, like, what was... -What did he say?
-Look, I get it from Andy. -You know, I don't have
any hard feelings there.
-TEENY: Right. SOL:
 And so the fact
 that Sam's telling me, ""Hey, I get it. It's all good."" It's like, ""Okay, maybe
I can work with this guy."" SOL: Even though I worked
 with Gabe last night to take out Sierra, I think that dude's a player. I'm starting
to get, like, just... I'm so unsure
of their dynamics that, like, we should try
and make it be Gabe. SOL:
Yeah. Okay. SOL:
 At some point,
 we need to get out Gabe, and, um, that's
what I'm trying to do. (all exclaiming) Wow. RACHEL: Okay. CAROLINE:
 Tree mail says,
 ""Only one of us is safe."" So, what's tricky
 about this type of pairing is you're really trying
to think about, ""Okay, who will get me
to that last stage ""of the challenge
 where I can actually compete for individual immunity?"" But I also want to be careful
 not to pick someone who's so competitive
 and so strong that they're gonna be a shoe-in
to win immunity. SAM:
Andy? Let's do it. -I'll go with Andy.
-All right. ANDY: Sam grabs me and is like,
 ""Andy, let's go. Let's do this.""
I thought that was interesting because I really
 betrayed him last night. But I kind of looked at it as a pretty good opportunity
 for us to at least, like,
in a challenge setting, just be kind of bros again. SAM:
 I'm really down to go
 head-to-head against Andy. If it comes down to me and Andy, I'm gonna beat him out. GABE: Me and Kyle are partners going into the challenge today,
and that's a very exciting thing for me because he's won
 the last three challenges. So, if there's anybody you want
going to battle with you, it's the guy who's on
a winning streak, and I got him. KYLE:
Based on just general knowledge
 of the game, you can expect to work together
 in a pair to a point. And then that other person
in your pair is going to become your mortal enemy
 at the end of this challenge, which is exactly why
 I picked Gabe. I think that I can beat Gabe
when we go head-to-head. ♪ ♪ Come on in! Welcome. (laughing) All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge. First things first.
Got to take back the necklaces. Look at Sue coming to me. -Oh.
-Look at this.
How kind. Thank you. -Thank you, Kyle.
-Absolutely. PROBST:
Once again, individual immunity
is back up for grabs. This morning in tree mail, you were given instructions
to divide into pairs. So let's get into those pairs.
Let me see what happened. Get next to your partner.
Let's see what's what. So, Kyle, you made these pairs. How did that go? -What happened?
-KYLE: I think everybody just kind of jived
pretty good. You know,
Gabe and I locked eyes, and I asked him to be mine
and he said yes. (laughing) All right,
let's review our pairs. We have Sue and Genevieve. We have Caroline and Rachel, Teeny and Sol, Gabe and Kyle, Andy and Sam. All right, today's challenge
is gonna run in stages. For the first stage, you're gonna crawl
 through a narrow tunnel filled with sand
 and retrieve one puzzle step. You'll then race
 to dig up a second step. The first three pairs
 to get back with their steps move on to the next stage. The last two pairs are out.
No shot at immunity. For the next stage, you will use those steps
 to build a staircase. Once you get to the top,
 you will attempt to cross a three-level
 balance beam. The first two pairs to finish move on to the final stage. You are pairs no more. You will compete
as four individuals. You'll use your hands and arms
 to brace against two walls while your feet balance on very narrow footholds. It will be painful.
 You will feel it. When you drop, you are out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final nine--
single digits. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the ninth person voted out and become the second member
of our jury. In addition, you're playing for a reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? (all voicing assent) Final four--
those last two pairs that move on
to the final round-- you will enjoy an afternoon
picnic back at camp. BLT sandwiches, potato chips, soft drinks. -Worth playing for?
-(all voicing assent) All right.
Oh, one more thing. -Ooh.
-Oh, no. The first two pairs who are out lose their vote at tonight's Tribal Council. -Wow.
-What?! Oh, yeah, one more thing. PROBST: You will take a journey
with a chance -to earn it back.
-Wow. Now we got some stakes
worth playing for. -All right.
-PROBST: We're gonna draw
for spots. Here we go. Let's go. All right, let's do this. First three pairs
to finish move on to the next stage. Last two pairs are out,
no shot at immunity. Here we go.
Survivors ready? Go! One at a time, you got
to get through this tunnel and retrieve one puzzle step. You're working
through a very narrow, very low tunnel
with a lot of sand in it. -Kyle working on those knots.
-SOL: Hell, yeah, Teeny. -PROBST: There goes Teeny.
-SOL: Hell, yeah, Teeny. Your knot's at your right. Yeah. PROBST:
You got to then untie
that puzzle step, and get it and you through
the rest of this tunnel. It is Kyle in the early lead, yet to lose
an immunity challenge. -You're good. Go, Gabe.
-(Sam groans) PROBST:
Here comes Sam
with his puzzle step. You're good! Here goes Andy. Three pairs are moving on,
so keep digging. SUE:
You're doing good, Genevieve. PROBST:
Genevieve down on the end. -And Teeny.
-My ass is too big! -KYLE: Come on, man,
-PROBST: There goes Gabe. we got this. Come on, buddy. Andy's through. Start digging. Gabe's through.
It is Sam and Andy, Kyle and Gabe in the lead. -Genevieve is through.

good job! PROBST:
You're good! Go, Sue! -Let's go, Teeny!
-SOL: Hell, yeah. PROBST:
Gabe and Kyle working
on that second step. Andy and Sam
working on that second step. (grunting) You're good.
Go, Caroline! RACHEL:
Sorry, Caroline. PROBST:
Abe and Kyle moving on. GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, Sue, yes. Sue is through. You're good. -Start digging!
-Okay. Dig. PROBST:
You're good. Go, Sol! Jeff? -Our piece is out of the bag.
-PROBST: Yup. -That's on you all.
-I'm through. PROBST:
Caroline's through. Find a step. TEENY:
You got it, Sol. -Let's go.
-PROBST: Sol is through. Everybody now digging
for their second puzzle step. Sam and Andy--
they are on their puzzle step, -but they cannot get it out.
-(grunting) GENEVIEVE:
We're so close. (indistinct chatter) PROBST:
Kyle and Gabe are moving on. PROBST: We're looking
for two more pairs. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Who is it gonna be? Look at that.
Teeny and Sol have it! They're moving on!
We're looking for one more. -Oh, my God.
-It is going to be Rachel, Caroline, Sam and Andy, or Genevieve and Sue. Sam and Andy have been working
on that piece for a long time, -cannot get it out.
-Yeah. Yeah. PROBST:
Andy's pulling on it. Can we wedge it out? GENEVIEVE:
One, two and three. -Go, go, go! Go!
-SOL: Good job, guys. PROBST:
There it is! Genevieve and Sue kept working, -and they have moved on.
-We did it. We did it. -PROBST:
Sam and Andy are out.
-We did it. We did it. PROBST:
Rachel and Caroline are out. No shot at immunity. -(sighs)
-CAROLINE: That was hard. PROBST:
You have lost your votes. Will have a chance
to earn them back later today. Sue and Genevieve,
you're moving on. Sol and Teeny, you're moving on. Kyle and Gabe, you're moving on. Move up to the next stage

to the final round. Last pair is out,
no shot at immunity. Here we go.
Survivors ready? Go!
It is one puzzle step -at a time. That's the trick.

in order. You got to figure out
what piece you need. These are all puzzle pieces. The question is
which spots do they go in? Pull out the next one. It's a lot of communication. -SUE: What do you got?

 It's a very interesting
 dynamic after the challenge. We're all split up into three separate groups. There are the no-vote
 journey people, and they're off on a different
 island somewhere doing God knows what
to try and earn their vote back. Then there's Genevieve and Sue, who didn't lose their vote, but they didn't
get a reward, either. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And then there's
 the reward group: me, Kyle, Teeny and Sol. -Oh!
-Congrats, guys. Gabe's not with us right now. GABE:
 This is one of the best
 days of my life. This is bucket list.
This is, ""Oh, my God. I'm wearing the necklace."" And then, on top of that,
 it's the first proper meal I've had in 16 days. I got dizzy from just how good it felt. I'm hallucinating right now. -(groans) -TEENY: All we're hearing from Gabe right now is
 just pleasureful moaning and groaning
 as he bites into this BLT. (moans) TEENY:
 And on the other side of me, I have Sol,
who is just a burp machine. (loud burping) SOL:
 I grew up burping
 in front of my family. Whenever I'm just so comfortable
around people, I'll let it go. (burps loudly) I was trying
to keep up with Sol. (burping) It was impossible. (burping) SOL:
 I'd much rather have a cool cartoon burp than,
like, a weak-ass burp. (loud burping) GABE:
 I would chug some soda to try to force more out, and I would just get a little,
like... (imitates burp) (burps) And then, Sol just would be,
like, have his head down and lift up and just go... (loud burping) And then put his head back down,
and I was like, ""I feel small right now."" (loud burping) Yeah. GABE:
I mean, you wanted
Sam last night. You know I did. How do you feel about tonight? I'm so down for it. SOL:
 Sam, I necessarily
 don't want to get out. I believe he trusts me. But honestly, the reason why
 I would vote out Sam is 'cause that's what everyone wants
to do, and I'm riding the boat. It's not my name, number one. That's the most important thing. My name's not on there. Genevieve will be on board with whatever we bring to her. Sue will give us
the majority we need if we get Genevieve. KYLE:
 This is the first time I'm actually vulnerable
 in this game. I'm nervous because you never know what Genevieve
and Sue would be talking about. But, you know,
I don't really see Genevieve as, like, a super social,
like, a thinker in this game. This is what I wanted
to talk to you about. Sol wants Gabe out. SUE:
 The first time
 Tuku went to Tribal, Kyle wrote my name down. So tonight, my plan was to do a blindside on Kyle. I quite like Gabe, and I don't want him
to go home yet. I know.
He's such a good guy. -That's a huge...
-And so, like,
my preference would be get out Sol. SUE:
 But I learned that
 Sol is after Gabe. If I lose Gabe... ...like, my whole game is shot. -Sue is... Yeah.
-GABE: You know... -She's great
to have on our side.
-GABE: Yeah. -I think it's, like, very nice.
-GABE: Sue is not gonna be the person to be, like,
""Hey, everybody, it's Sol tonight."" We could do a big blindside
on Sol. It would have to be a total blindside
because he's so clever. I've had a bee in my bonnet
 since my Lavo beach, where Sol targeted my ally Rome. (burps loudly) And we've mended fences-ish. But, like, in this game,
 I am so petty, and so, I've really just been waiting. ""When can I get Sol?"" SAM: I'm going
 into this mystery journey without a vote. I feel vulnerable and in danger and completely powerless. I have to find a way to get my vote back. RACHEL:
The last two times, it was -the same puzzle
for every person.
-ANDY: Yeah. Three people were separated
and did the same puzzle, and if they won,
they got their vote back. SAM:
 I went into the challenge with such heart and such motivation that this was gonna be the one
 that I won. I... I really wanted that one. I want it because I don't want to be the guy
 that's scratching to, you know, hang on. SAM:
 I don't know
 what's in store, but I still have a fighting shot at getting myself back into this game. All right. ANDY: These journeys are like nightmare fuel for me. We have to compete in a game, and the loser of this game
 is going to be the one player that loses their vote tonight. I'm like, ""Okay, Survivor put me on this journey. Like,

 So coming back into camp, the four of us have this plan
 to tell Sue and Genevieve about Sam. TEENY:
 And it doesn't really take any time for Sol
to just shout out, ""So, we decided Sam."" -SUE: Yeah.
-GABE: Yeah. TEENY:
 And everybody agreed
 upon Sam to go home. GABE:
But, yeah, I think if everyone's cool
with Sam tonight, we got numbers right now. We all worked together
last night. Let's work together
again tonight. GENEVIEVE: Everyone is happy
 with Sam going, but unfortunately
for everyone else... ...I had a lot of downtime
with Sue. And when I pitch the idea
 of blindsiding Sol, Sue is open to it
 on the condition that I talk to Gabe. He is the missing piece
 to this plan going forward or not. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. The reason Gabe is pivotal
to this plan is because Gabe has the numbers behind him. All of the Tukus
 will listen to him. He's the one who will make this happen. Okay. GENEVIEVE:
 And so, I think I can use the conversation
 from this morning to my advantage
 because it allows me to approach it
 in a way that he will be extra receptive to. Basically, the name
that was said... was you. GABE:
 So me and Genevieve
 go on a walk together and she tells me. She goes, ""Hey, this morning, Sol and Teeny were
throwing your name out."" -My preference would be...
I would like
-Yeah. to take out the, like,
 subtle threats. Literally, no one
 is talking about Sol. GABE:
 And she said, ""I think
 that we should make a move for Sol tonight."" -He's good with everybody,
and I think
-No. -him and Teeny want to play
 between Gata and Tuku.
 -No, I-I think you're right. There are dangerous players
 I'm working with that I need to be prepared
to strike against before they strike me. And if Sol is coming after me,
 he's gonna regret that. It'll burn my bridge with Teeny, which makes me more vulnerable
to you guys. -And, yeah, yeah.
-But, like, if he skates by a couple more,
like, it will be you, -it will be Kyle,
and then it'll turn to me.
-Yeah. I think we could do this but there are people that I need to be on board. -Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Okay. Sol's been, like, kind of working everybody.
Like, everybody feels like Sol is their BFF. Would you be okay
writing Sol's name? KYLE:
 I'm hearing from Genevieve
 that Sol's gonna go. Sam's not even
the target anymore. Yeah. KYLE:
 Hey, I'll do
 whatever you guys say as long as I stay around. I'm just really hoping
that the rest of the tribemates that have votes are going
to side with me and decide to keep me in this game
a day longer than Sol. Yeah. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 I am a planner,
 and this Sol plan has ""Genevieve Mushaluk""
written all over it. But it's very complicated
 to pitch a plan when you really have no idea what ingredients
are going into your plan. And how do you count the numbers when four people
 are on a journey? And will they all
 come back with a vote? Will they come back
 with no votes? And we need one more vote
 to do it. So, it all depends on what's coming back
 from the journey. It is a game
 for the four of us to play against one another
 in which three of us will earn our vote back,
and one of us will be without a vote
 at Tribal Council. So, the stakes are high. (neck cracking) SAM:
 This game is kind of like building a house of cards. We have to stack up these cards and not knock over the tower. CAROLINE:
 We have to form triangles on top of triangles
on top of triangles. And each card that you put down feels high-stakes. ♪ ♪ CAROLINE:
Got it? SAM: Wow. Ah. Seriously. I knocked over the tower. It all tumbled down, and I lost my vote tonight. -Back to camp we go.
-Yeah.
-RACHEL: Yeah. CAROLINE:
 Not a fan of losing my vote. I like having some control
 in the game, and I'm kind of opinionated on who I want
to have go home today. I think a lot of people
are on board -with that right now.
-I agree. I am, definitely. CAROLINE:
 If Kyle gets to the end, he's just gonna be absolutely
 hard to beat. Kyle is a big challenge threat. And I could see him winning -all the way to the end,
and, like...

I really want it to be Kyle, but without a vote, it's more
challenging for me to do so. -All right.

 Sam, Rachel, Caroline and Andy all return from the journey. And of course,
Caroline's the person who loses her vote. And I needed Caroline's vote 'cause she was gonna vote
with us no matter what. SAM:
We basically had to do, like, uh, reverse Jenga. We had to build a tower, and first one to knock over
the tower lost their vote. The way the votes are
shaking out right now are me, Kyle, Genevieve and Sue are gonna go Sol. And because Caroline doesn't have her vote,
five is a majority tonight. So, if we can get one more vote,
 there's our five for Sol. The difficult part of this is who else gets to know
this is happening. Hi.
So, what are we discussing? One of the stronger men
going home. Right. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 I am fully aware
 that lying to Teeny and voting out Sol is going
 to burn my bridge with Teeny. She is someone I have a complex
relationship with in this game. I care deeply about her.
I believe she cares about me. But I still think that this
 is the right move for me. Sol. I was thinking
that he can't... We can't keep him
for a long time. I think that Genevieve is feeling pretty froggy tonight. I think she's ready to jump
and hop and make a big move. But my current viewpoint
 on how to use Sol is to really just kind of
use him for a couple more votes and get rid of him. ANDY:
 And on the other hand, whenever there's a really
exciting blindside in the works, the last thing
you want to be is, you know,
missing the boat on that. Check back in with me and I'm,
like, if it's lined up, then... -Then you'd do it?
-Yeah, that'll be fine. Let me see
if I can line this up. As luck would have it,
 Andy told me Sol was also on his mind.
Not for tonight. But with a little encouragement, Andy's also in on this plan
for Sol tonight. And then
 the question mark became what about Sam and Rachel? And I thought, let's bring in Rachel
 and let's let Rachel decide
does she want Sam in or out? Okay. RACHEL:
 I am now an underdog
 in this game. And so, as much as I owe Sol for sending me
 the advantage, I am genuinely torn. But even more importantly, I don't know if I should
 let Sam in on the vote. This Tribal is my opportunity
to show these new allies that I am with them
and that they can count on me. SAM:
I want to, like,
know what's happening. I know. Hey, I can talk
to you more later. Just know that we are still
looking out for you. I can't tell you who it is.
It's not you. It's not. SAM:
 I feel very uneasy. I've been a social pariah
around here. Like, nobody wants
to talk to me. Rachel is the only person
 in the game that I believe
 I can genuinely trust, and I... I need her right now. So, I'm just gonna guess, -and you don't have
to confirm anything, obviously.
-Yeah. You're working with Tuku. You're blindsiding
one of the Lavo. -Yeah? Okay.
-Mm-hmm. I want... -Please. Please don't
blow up my spot, okay?
-I won't. I won't. Okay. I won't. SAM:
 I get the information
 from Rachel that there is a plan
 in the works to blindside Sol. And maybe I shouldn't blow up
her spot right after I tell her, ""Hey, I'm not gonna blow
 up your spot,"" but I have to be able
 to look out for myself. And so, it's time to cause chaos. It's time to blow this thing up. Okay. You're going home tonight. -S... Shut up.
-Let's go. Are you serious? I just found out
two seconds ago. Rachel. She was like, ""Sam,
 please don't blow up my spot."" And that's exactly
 what I'm doing. They're telling you it's me,
telling me it's Kyle, and they're voting you out. SOL:
 Me?! I'm going home tonight?! My first reaction is panic. But I work the best
when I'm at the bottom. -And I promise you...
-Okay. that if we don't do something, -you're going home tonight.
-Okay. You, me, Andy,
Genevieve and Teeny. I want Sue
out of this game because Sue is probably the most
 insulated player in this game. I love you so much. SAM:
 Not only does she have Caroline as a tight number one. She's got Gabe
 and she's starting to get inroads with Andy, Rachel, Genevieve. If I can get Sue out, it'll free up a lot more players
 to work with, and that's important
to me at this point. I think you blow up everybody's
game if you take out Sue. -All Right. Sue.
-What's Caroline got to do? -Sue.
-All right. -And Gabe can't...
Nobody on Tuku can find out.
-Okay. My head is
 on the chopping block. The sun's coming down. I know Tribal Council
 is coming, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes. The vote was me tonight. -What?
-Yup. So, you, Genevieve, Andy,
Sam and I are voting Sue. Teeny, vote Sue. Okay. My red flags just instantly go up. I have heard nothing about this. And Sol's my number one ally and best friend in this game. TEENY:
 So, my first instinct is, we have to
do something about it, we have to save Sol. Lay it on me.
What are you thinking? I'm trying
to take out Sue tonight. And if you vote with us,
she's gone. Who do you...
Sue? -Who do you got?
-It's me and Lavo. And I think
if we take out Sue... Yeah. ...Tuku is no more. ANDY:
 Things have totally exploded. I need people to make ballsy
moves with me in this game. ANDY:
 Sam is ready
 to make his big move. He wants to gun for Tuku. Dude, this is an exciting day. This is the best day yet. But can I work with Sam again and get rid of Sol later on? This is, like, very big
 decisions that need to be made in a really short
amount of time, because Tribal is looming. It's happening, like, very soon. We're good. What? GENEVIEVE:
 Unfortunately for me,
 my beautiful plan, which was carefully laid out, all the pieces were in place... -Oh, it's...
-I don't really understand how they could have the numbers
to do you. GENEVIEVE:
 I feel it slipping through my fingers,
and have the panic of, ""Oh, no.
Like, what if it is not Sol?"" Yeah, yeah, so, it was Rach... They pulled Rachel in. GENEVIEVE:
 Sol is coming to me and Teeny, and Teeny's getting pulled in, and it is a mess. Sue is the best target. 'Cause we were already gonna do
 that. So it's not like... -You guys want to do Kyle then?
-Yeah. We're getting Kyle out. It's Kyle.
Will you please vote Kyle? I saved you. RACHEL:
 I'm pretty conflicted
 about what to do. There's so much going on and there's so much chaos. It's starting to dawn on me that I should have never
said anything to Sam. Sol is just freaking out. SUE: Once word spread
 that Sol was getting more paranoid, more paranoid, we all changed all of our plans. And we kept going
 back and forth, jumping from person to person
to person to person. KYLE: It's just a lot
 of running around, it's a lot of craziness, and I'm starting to sweat
a little bit on this one. GENEVIEVE:
 It's an absolute mess, and the sun is setting, and we do not have time
for a mess. -Yeah.
-This is nuts. This is nuts, man. Conversations are still live about ""what are we gonna do?"" GENEVIEVE:

All right,
so let's review today. Three-stage challenge
that ran in pairs, but it ended up in a showdown
between Kyle and Gabe. Gabe pulled it out. Before we get into the details, one of the things
that I noticed was this group camaraderie. Lots of people hugging, ""Congratulations, man.
I gave it my best."" But at a certain point, the reminder that it's personal
is going to take over. So, Kyle, can you have both?
Can you have a group of people congratulate each other,
and you mean it, and then you immediately
start thinking, ""But I'm taking you out,
and you have no idea""? Yeah, Gabe and I were
a perfect example of that today because, like,
when Gabe was able to pull off that W today,
I was genuinely proud of him. I was happy for that. But then, obviously,
that comes with repercussions because that means that necklace
is no longer around my neck, which means my safety
is not guaranteed. But then there's
the war at hand, where we do have to face off,
we do have to start talking about
what we're going to do and-and who needs to go home and why. PROBST:
Genevieve, does it
make it harder to vote somebody out when you have established a society that says, ""We're gonna
treat each other kindly, even in defeat""? GENEVIEVE:
I don't think so because everyone sitting here is... a fan of the game. And so they can compartmentalize the different aspects
of the game. And it doesn't feel good,
but it's not because we've decided to give it
our all and be a community. It just doesn't feel good
for other reasons. But for me, personally, I saw my name on parchment at the first Tribal Council
I was at. And that gave me, you know, 007 license to kill
in this game because that could have been
my last Tribal Council. PROBST: So, Sam, one of the elements of today was four people lost votes. You had a chance to get 'em back.
How did that go? SAM:
I was able to finally earn my voting power back
in the game after feeling pretty helpless for the last two
Tribal Councils. But, you know, Caroline ended
up losing her vote tonight. PROBST:
So, Caroline, -you will not vote tonight?
-No. PROBST: How impactful is that
with all the uncertainty that's going on? It's a really weird feeling in that there's so much chaos
happening, even just behind me
in this very moment and leading up to Tribal Council. And I want to know
what's happening, and I want to be in the know,
but it feels so bizarre because I actually
can't do much about it. I can share the knowledge
that I have and my opinions, but at the end of the day,
I can't put pen to parchment. PROBST:
Sue, something else I'm noticing about tonight's Tribal is
from the second you sat down, there are tiny little
conversations happening. Yeah. In my peripheral vision
right now, I can see conversations
going on. So, it-it's sort of
freaking me out a little that people are having
these conversations already and we're still trying
to have conversations with you. Sol, the chaos
that is happening right now-- is this what it was like
back at camp? SOL:
Yes. You know, you would like to have a solid plan going in. And there was just confusion
and then more confusion. Bottom line, this game means
a lot to everybody, so you want to make sure that
you're all on the same page. And, uh, it looked
pretty chaotic, yeah. -Andy, do you agree?
-ANDY: Absolutely. The chaos is happening right now because we d not
finish at camp. I don't feel like
there's a need to hide it. It was explosive,
this scramble today. Pure disarray. No one's feeling
secure right now. I think there are conversations
that still need to be had, but we're sitting here
answering your questions, and we're just trying
to deal with that right now. PROBST:
And it's your Tribal, -so, I got some questions.
-ANDY: Sure. -You got some talking to do.
-Definitely. -We got all night.
-(laughing)
-ANDY: You just want everyone to shush? Except for me,
and I... Let me whisper. I want to get my whispers in,
and then no one else can. That would make me feel
the most secure, but that's not possible
out here. PROBST:
Teeny, Survivor requires you to be on point at any given time,
but this is very specific. This is,
""Not sure what the plan is, ""not sure who I can trust.
We only have a few minutes before we vote,
so I must..."" What? -Can you repeat the question?
-PROBST: Yeah. If there was one skill
that you could rely on right now, what would it be? Adaptability. I mean, I've had
different experiences going to Tribal Council. I've gone in confident and sure and been blindsided
and absolutely wrong. I've gone in confident and sure and been right
and found people I could trust. But tonight,
it's completely unfamiliar because I am going in
absolutely unclear of what I'm doing, what the people
who I've talked to are doing. And I think a lot of us
are feeling that way. PROBST:
Genevieve, that's the fear. You can never trust, ultimately, if the last
conversation was the last one you needed to have. GENEVIEVE:
What I would say is, good players are good
at deciphering new information, i.e., my plan needs to change from information
that's just noise. And so, I am going to
stay the course. And I think there are
other players out here who want to make moves and can also tell the difference
between news and noise. Kyle, is this distracting,
this animated conversation? Heck, yeah, it's distracting. There's something about it
that just, is, like, tugging on my ear. Every time I see somebody
lean over or do something, all I want to do is, like,
climb in the middle of it -and hear what's being said.
-Yeah. Sol gonna join in. So, Caroline, do you have
an idea of why there's chaos? CAROLINE:
All I know is that
chaos is beneficial for people who are in bad spots. If you're in a good spot,
and you have good ""plaos""... and you have a good plan,
chaos can just destroy you. So I'm not a fan of chaos.
I... Yeah. But again, I'm not voting,
so, I'll let the chaos happen. But they can vote for you. You know, that is true. I do not like that. But the thing is,
we also have to think about what are

 to, like, lose their spirit a little bit. It's just tough. It's just hard. I mean, there's just a lot
 going on. Like, I haven't slept,
I haven't really eaten. It's just so overwhelming because it seems like everything
 is just gonna be easy and perfect

 social game, and I feel like I'm attached to everybody. The only person that I don't
 get a good vibe from is Venus. TEVIN: She's a player. SODA: No. I do think that she is... she is as-as big
as a threat as people think. I was, like, day one with Venus. Like,
we connected on a heart level. But very quickly, I learned
 people don't trust her. And if she's being perceived
 a certain way, and it's lighting off alarms
in more than one person, I have to distance myself
 from her, even if it's hard. If no one trusts her
as a number, she's not a number
to me, either. -Today, probably not, but...

 she has her game face on, and I know what's going on. Soda's not dumb, you know? Soda's with the numbers. Tevin-- right now, he's king.
He's at the top. Tevin has a deep,
 personal connection with literally everyone but me. So, if the most social butterfly
is not trying to, like, talk to me in any way,
then I'm screwed. This is amazing.
Thank you. Um... Next thing I want to do is
go get some vines 'cause I want
to put our clothing line up, and then I want
to build the thing for this and work on the fireplace,

Okay. What we need
to do is just... VENUS:
 Right now, I'm stressed
 because it feels like I'm not even being heard. It's, like, everyone has, like, some kind of connection with
 one another, but I feel like I don't really have a deep
 emotional bond with anyone, and it feels like...
I'm not even, like, worth... like, I'm not even worth
talking to. I feel like people might look
 at me, and they assume things have been handed to me,
 or that I haven't worked hard or struggled in any way. But the truth is that my parents
immigrated from Iran to Canada. They realized that as the government was becoming
 more and more oppressive, that this was no place
 to raise a young woman. And from childhood,
 I've tried to show just how capable
 and strong Persian women are. So, my whole life, it's, like,
I don't want to be seen as weak. Like, I need
to be this, like, tough badass. Like, I can't let people
 see me struggle. And so, in this game, I'm going in
with that same mentality, and it's kind of biting me
in the ass because people want
 to see that vulnerability. They want to be able
to connect with you emotionally, and I'm struggling
 to do that right now. It hurts on a social
 and, like, personal level to see that no one's even trying
 to make an effort to acknowledge your existence. And I don't know what to do. Makes you feel like there's something wrong
with you. And, like,

 with so much energy. Teachers couldn't handle me. You know,
I haven't been the sharpest tool in the shred my whole life,

 had a guitar in his closet. I found it. The power of rock-- the thing that helped me

I think I blew my own mind. -Good job, Ben.

-BEN: Yeah. And, like, she might have
an extra vote, too, so... The way that it's going is Tim and Ben... and then me, and they want
 to work with Maria. -Just maybe for, like,
a minute, you know...
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 And then you have
 the three women and myself-- ""Charlie's Angels."" MORIAH:
I do want to say, like, I think it's really important
to, like, solidify -and talk about this now.
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's trying
 to count to four. The Angels and Charlie-- that's four. But that leaves me
on the bottom. If we lose three times,
it's just the Angels. And so, I feel a little bit,
 you know, dancing without a partner
 out here, you know? It's just me on the dance floor,
 and I want to-I want to waltz with someone.
I want to tango with someone. You know, that's what I want
to do out here. I want to have a ride-or-die. And it seems like Maria and I have built bonds
 with both sides. So, if there's someone out here
that I feel like would be a good alliance partner
for me, it would be Maria. CHARLIE: So it's, like... The ladies and me,
which I friggin' love. -Yeah, I love that, too.
-I love it. But the thing is is, like,
we need strength, obviously. -Like, we need some strong...
-People? Maria and I might be
 the two best buds, you know, that pair that can decide
the direction of the tribe. In any alliance,
there has to be sub-alliances. -Right?
-Yeah, and, uh... Which is dirty to think about,
but, like, there has to be. But it's-it's...
it's just a fact of the game. And, like, my favorite players
are Malcolm and Denise. -Yeah. Malcolm and Denise.
-Like, I'm a... -I'm like a ride-or-die player.
-You like... Denise is one of my favorites. And it's gonna be us two. Cool? I... We're gonna do this. I feel like I could emulate her because she's kind of, like,
that strong... that strong mom. Yeah. You're a stronger mom.
I can tell. MARIA:
 I like the idea
 of working with Charlie. You know, this reminds me a lot
like Malcolm and Denise. -And if we just
keep our options open,
-Yeah. -like, we don't have
to make any decisions right now.
-Yeah. At this point,
 we could go either way with Moriah and Jem
 or with Ben and Tim. So it kind of was
exciting for me to think that, well,
maybe the two of us could be the decision-makers
working together. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yup. VENUS:
 I'm not blind. I see that I'm on the bottom, and it all comes back to Tevin. It doesn't matter
 how hard I try. He has too many links
with too many people, and there's nothing
 I can possibly do to compete with those. So I want to double down
 on finding that idol in order to actually ensure some
kind of backup safety for myself and turn the tides to throw
the votes on someone else. So, I need to find this idol
 and I need to find it quick. My feeling is that I'm up on the chopping block
or Venus. So if I can get an idol, that
will save me, that would be big. HUNTER: I guess it's something
 about being Southern or something about just wanting
 to collect firewood, but I've played it really well
because they all think I'm just, you know,
the happy-go-lucky country guy who's just having a good time
out here camping. But the reality is
 I'm here to play hard. I'm the only one going out and getting a substantial amount
 of firewood, so why not just look around? I know the trails, I know
 interesting-looking trees, and so, I'm pretty confident
that I'm gonna find this thing. Ooh. Ooh! Snap. What is this? Oh.
A Beware Advantage? So I see a parchment paper sticking out of a tree, and I pull it out
and it says ""Beware."" I didn't come to Survivor to... not take risks, so we're gonna open it
and see what it says. Well, Beware Advantage is here.
Dig down. Oh, my God. So, I open up
 the Beware Advantage and it tells me to dig right
 beneath where this note is. And I'm digging, digging,
digging, digging. And I hit a box. Oh, my God. What is this? I'm super excited
 and I go to open it up and there's a lock on it. I was like,
""Oh, why is there a lock?"" Then I realized that the box
 has, like, a little tube, and then there's a note
in there. Oh, my God. It's complicated. That's why it's... This Beware Advantage is
 very different from anything I've seen
 because the stipulation on the Beware Advantage is
 you have to lose to retrieve
 further instructions. So, if we continue to win,
I'm still safe. If we do lose, then I am gonna
 go into scramble mode because if I don't find it before

 I honestly can't tell
 if she's for real because she can look at you
 and make you feel like you're her best friend, so, Kenzie is playing a great social
 game, and that's dangerous. So at this point, my plan is to blindside Kenzie. Q: Jess threw Kenzie
 under the bus by saying, ""Kenzie threw out 'we should
 get rid of strength.'"" If Kenzie's supposed to be in my alliance of three, she shouldn't have said that. It'll all work out. Trust me. Right now,

Let's pop this in. But I think
 it's just so important to connect with people
 out here, and I'm going to have to
 figure out a way. So, I'm a massive Taylor Swift fan, and I love Star Wars
 and Harry Potter and all these nerdy things. So, anytime I can sort of
be spouting all... any sort of stuff like that
and... and just showing people what I like and who I am,
that's what I want to do. Whoever runs out -of songs first loses.
-MORIAH: From one artist. CHARLIE:
What you got, Ben? I'd go with, uh... -I'd go with Metallica.
-CHARLIE: Metallica? Greatest metal band of all time. Yeah. CHARLIE:
 I've been getting to know Ben really well.
He's, like, a music savant.
 So I was like, ""I'm gonna put
 my Taylor Swift knowledge head-to-head against
Ben's Metallica knowledge."" -Metallica versus T. Swift,
Charlie versus Ben?
-Yeah. -You ready?
-Okay, go. ""All of the Girls
You Loved Before."" -""My Apocalypse.""
-""The Best Day."" -BEN: ""Seek & Destroy.""
-CHARLIE: ""You Belong with Me."" -""Jump in the Fire.
-""Should've Said No."" ""Motorbreath."" ""Mr. Perfectly Fine""
about Joe Jonas. -Ooh.
-They're cool now, though. -(laughing) -BEN: What a stupid way
 to pass time. And if I had done that
 in any other setting, everybody around me would be like, ""Ben, shut up."" But here, everybody was like,
""Yo, they're going for it."" -""Dyers Eve.""
-""Gorgeous."" -""Enter Sandman.""
-(laughing) -""Delicate.""
-""Sad But True."" ""This is Why
We Can't Have Nice Things."" -""Holier Than Thou.""
-(laughing) -""I Did Something Bad.""
-""The Unforgiven."" MORIAH: I'm living
 in a universe right now where I am wildly entertained by just two guys just
saying names back and forth. -""The Struggle Within.""
-""Clean."" -""Ain't My Bitch.""
-(laughing) -Facts: It's a Metallica song.
-CHARLIE: I ain't your bitch. It's a grueling battle, back and forth,
one after another. BEN:
All right, onto the next album. ""Some Kind of Monster."" ""We are Never Ever
Getting Back Together."" Like, ever. -""The House That Jack Built.""
-""All Too Well."" -""Until It Sleeps.""
-""All Too Well,""
ten-minute version. Ooh. Okay, well, we have that
on this album. Don't worry. (laughing) TIM:
 It's, like, name after name. And, like, yo,
 y'all at least named, like, 75 songs each, yo. So we're getting into the albums
I'm not very into, -but I still got 'em in my mind.
-CHARLIE: Ooh, yeah, let's go. -Come on!
-BEN: I've still got 'em. JEM: I've never listened to a single song of Metallica's. Wait. There's the Metallica
album with Lou Reed, which is really terrible. JEM:
 At some point, I'm like, ""Are we done? Like, is this it?"" BEN:
I'm just thinking on this album.
I got more. Okay, here we go.
""Creeping Death."" A song about Passover. Uh, ""Coney Island."" ""2 X 4"" ""You're Not Sorry."" Damn. All right. How many more you got? A lot. BEN:
Man, if I only knew the
really bad albums a little more. (laughing) I don't believe
in any bad Taylor Swift albums. BEN:
 Listen, there's a bit of
 an unfair advantage, because although I love Metallica, I'm not a stan
for terrible albums. Dude, I think I got to tap out. It's not right. Well, Ben,
this has been the great war. -TIM: Great job.
-Which is... which is... We can... We'll go round two
with another band. -Which is another
Taylor Swift song.
-Oh. Dead. CHARLIE: I was pretty impressed
 with both of us just being able
to recall so many songs, and it was just fun. It was pure, pure fun. And doing things like that, I think it just
 endears you to people. We easily named a hundred songs. Yeah, we... we went hard. Yeah. Charlie is an adorable goofball, and I love him for it. I am having the most fun out here, you know.
 It's, like, I would say, even
if I ever did Survivor again, I don't think the experience
would be this dope, 'cause it's these people that are making it
so enjoyable for me. ♪ ♪ So, I don't know if you said,
Liz, but did you ever say that you would, like, remarry? Maybe. I cannot imagine the person that would marry Liz. -Oh.
-I don't mean this any type of way,
but there is a special type of... man
who can deal with someone making so much money
and not actually needing them. Wow. LIZ: I own my own company.
I'm an online entrepreneur, and I've pushed myself so hard
because I came from nothing. And honestly, I came into this game wanting the title. I don't need the money. The money would better my life, but it wouldn't change my life. And so, winning this game is
 going to show my daughter and my family that, ""Wow, Liz
really can do anything. Maybe I can do something similar
 one day."" That's the most important thing. TEVIN: I think that
there's plenty of men out there who would want to be with Liz. -That's for your...
your first comment.
-SODA: Agreed. TEVIN:
So, whether you're looking
at a range of men now... -Well, they want to,
but can they?
-TEVIN: Ooh. Everybody wants to be with Liz.
Trust me. TEVIN:
Oh. You trust lady luck. RANDEN:
 I just don't understand what kind of game
 Liz is playing. Nobody knows who Liz is.
 Liz wears rainbows. She's a CEO of five companies. She teaches everybody
 how to make a million dollars. So, it's-it's crazy. Have you had any conversations
with her? Like, real ones? Yeah, a little bit. Well,
the problem with Liz is that she's like a... It's like
 talking to a billboard. You know what I mean?
It's kind of like, you know, -she's telling you...
-She's got a phrase
for everything? Yeah. ""I'm like a CEO,
I'm a company."" And she's like, ""Well, I'm too good to do this.""
And whatever. At this point,
 I have to make a decision. I have this amazing
 Beware Advantage. I'm very excited because if I complete
the Beware Advantage, I have an idol in my pocket. The problem is, for me to stay in the game longer
 and make big moves, I just feel as if, like,
 I need one person to trust on this island, and that's the biggest issue
 I have in my tribe. I don't really trust anybody. -Good talking. -RANDEN: Soda and Hunter are close to Tevin. -I just chugged this. Like...
-You need them electrolytes. It was full. RANDEN:
 And then Liz-- there's too many
inconsistencies. Like, I do a lot
of podcast interviews. I've done, like, 300 in the last -Yeah?
-two years or something. RANDEN:
 I don't know. Something's not up
 with that story. But that's just me. It could be Survivor kind of paranoia. Venus, I think, in my opinion, she's the ultimate liar
 in this game. -If I go off,
and you see me, like,
-Yeah. -by the water, I'm just, like...
-Chilling. -I'm just chilling. Like,
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not, like, looking around. RANDEN:
 So, I don't have many options. But at the end of the day,
 I made a decision and I said, ""I'm going to trust
the one person ""I originally thought
not to trust, and if it fails,
then that's on me."" -Okay. -RANDEN: weirdly enough, the person I shouldn't
 be comfortable with-- I'm actually comfortable
 with Venus. I shouldn't be, though.
 She's young, she's ambitious, and I just feel
 like she will cut my throat. But I came to Survivor to gamble and risk. So... I did it. I told her. VENUS:
 So, Randen tells me
 that he finds himself a Beware Advantage. And the moment I heard it,
I became, like, a statue. I couldn't process
what he was saying 'cause I was equal parts
excited, equal parts pissed
that it didn't happen to me. My whole thing is, like,
I want to use your gifts and my gifts
to get further in the game. You know what I mean? Like, ""I'm like, damn,
like, there really is... I can't catch a damn break."" And you're my break.
God bless you. I really thought that
 my life in this game is over. And within the span
of just one day, everything has changed. All of a sudden, I have an advantage I could
potentially use to my favor, a rock solid-alliance. So, it does a lot to...
breathe some life in my game. You know?
I'm-I'm feeling pumped. ♪ ♪ Come on in! -Good morning, Siga.
-Good morning, Jeff. -(chuckles)
-Hi. PROBST:
Good morning, Nami. Good morning. ♪ ♪ Siga and Nami,
getting your first look at the new Yanu tribe. Jelinsky voted out -at the first Tribal Council.
-Ooh. -RANDEN: Wow.
-PROBST: Wow. Massive reactions. -Wow.
-Whoa. -Wow.
-Legendary. -Last name, first out.
-Oh. -Oh!
-Oh!
-Oh! -HUNTER:
I said last name, first out.
-Oh, my gosh. I guess, were there
several reasons -you guys voted him, or...
-(laughing) KENZIE:
There-there was, uh,
more than several. There was more than seven.
We'll say that. -Wow.
-SODA: Oh, my God. The jokes keep coming, right? PROBST:
So, Q, obviously, it's not fun for Yanu to go
to Tribal and vote somebody out, but it is a game
and you're down somebody. And clearly, these two other
tribes are taking a little joy in talking and joking
about who it was and why they were voted out. How does that feel? Well, right now, Jeff, in this game,
we're the laughingstock, and their six has been better
than our six. Right now we're down to five and we'll see if their five
is better than ours. PROBST:
Soda, he's slinging it
right back at you. Make fun all you want.
Let's go. I could catch it.
It's fine, and I like it. You're gonna see five
and five. Here we go. (laughing) He did it first. BHANU:
Jeff, let me tell you one thing. I'm from India.
And we want freedom. Gandhi was on a hunger strike
and he won freedom for India. Hunger is not closest to my mind. What we are hungry for
is the challenge and to win that idol today. Mm. -Fire.
-PROBST: All right, well, let's get to today's
immunity challenge. First things first.
Got to take back the idols. Later, Frodo. -Bye, Frodo.
-Bye, Frodo.
-Thank you. Thank you. All right. This is cute. Hey, he's part
of the Nami tribe now, so we had to make sure
he had his own Buff. -PROBST: Oh, nice.
-Ooh. Fortunately, I always carry
a little knife of my own. -No!
-(all voicing dissent) Jeff. -SODA: I told you
he wouldn't let that slide.
-Yeah. -That's hard-core.
-I've been knew that.
I'm not surprised. You don't own this idol, Nami.
You got to win this idol. -Hey, Jeff.
-Ooh. Scorpio energy right there. Thank you, Jeff. Your hat is orange, though,
Jeff, so thank you. (laughing) Wow. All right, shall we get
to today's challenge? -Yeah.
-Yeah, let's do it. PROBST:
 For today's challenge, one person from each tribe
 is gonna race to release a machete, you're gonna chop a rope
 and drop two wheels. You'll put those wheels
 on your cart. You'll then dig up two chests, put the chest on your cart. You'll then push your cart
 through the course, moving obstacles along the way. When you get to the end, you'll
use the pieces inside the chest to form a massive Survivor arch puzzle. First two tribes
to finish win immunity, safe from the vote.
You're not going home. In addition,
you're playing for reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? (all voicing assent) -We ready.
-PROBST: First tribe to finish, this will change everything. (cheering) Oh, my God. Hooks. PROBST:
A massive Survivor fishing kit. MORIAH:
Oh, my God. PROBST:
Second tribe to finish-- not as extensive,
but it'll get it done. Mask, snorkel, fins,
Hawaiian sling. Last tribe to finish,
otherwise known as the losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the second person voted out,
and as a penalty for losing, I will take your flint.
Yanu, you're still trying to earn yours for the
first time. All right, sit-outs. Siga, you have one person
you're gonna sit out. Who's it gonna be? I'll sit out, but I want
first go with the fishing gear. -You got it, Mo.
-PROBST: Moriah gonna sit out
for Siga. Nami, one extra person.
Who's gonna sit out? -The one and only Liz.
-All right, Liz gonna sit out for Nami. Sit-outs,
take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give
a minute to strategize. We'll get it on. Let's do it! All right, here we go.
For immunity and reward.
Survivors ready? Go! It's gonna be Hunter,
Jem and Q on the machete. You've got to unthread that rope
to release your machete, then chop the ropes
to release your wheels. Hunter has his machete. He drops his wheels. -MARIA: Jem!
-Make them wheels fall. PROBST:
Jem has hers. And she drops her wheels. (whoops)
Go, Jem! -TIFFANY: Come on, Q!
-PROBST: Q has his. And two, three. (groaning) -He drops his wheels.
-Come on, let's go! (overlapping chatter) -One, two, three.
-One, two, three. -MORIAH: Let's go! Let's go!
-Okay. MORIAH:
Go, Siga! You're running. Now you got to get the wheels
onto your cart. Make sure you get that cotter
pin in so those wheels stay on. -Go, Jem.
-Let's go. Let's go.
-One, two, three. Go. PROBST:
It's gonna be Nami, then Siga. PROBST:
Yanu once again in last. And they're on the move. Keep going,
keep going, keep going! PROBST:
You're good, Siga. You're good, Nami.
Start digging up your chest. LIZ:
Go, Nami! You're good, Yanu.
Start digging. Got a handle. PROBST:
Everybody on the chest. You got to get 'em
onto your cart before you can continue. (grunting) So you got that? Once again, it is a challenge that requires effort
and communication. We got the handle, we got it. Here they come.
We need help with this. Nami has their first chest. Dig, dig some more. PROBST:
Yanu working
on their first chest. Get the handle, Bhanu. PROBST:
It is Nami in a familiar spot:
the lead. Yanu has their first chest. (grunting) -PROBST: There you go.
-(grunting) Right. Siga now working
on their first chest. -What's your name again?
-Mo, I go by. You? -Mo? I'm Liz.
-Yeah. Nice to meet you, Liz. -Nice to meet you.
-Oh, man. (overlapping chatter) -These chests are heavy.
-MORIAH: Come on, you guys! PROBST:
Now that cart's got
a lot of weight. It's Nami in the lead. LIZ:
Come on, Hunter! -Tevin!
-You're good. Start clearing out
the obstacles. We keep pushing. I got it. Come on. Here comes Yanu working
on that second chest. All right, it's Tiffany,
Bhanu and Q. We got Tim, Jem,
Charlie, Ben and Maria. Everybody for Siga working together
to get that chest on their cart. Also, I love your glasses,
by the way. -Thank you. I love your socks.
-Thank you. -Come on. Everybody.
-Everybody push. Everybody push. -There goes Yanu on the move.
-Yeah. Push. (overlapping chatter) Now Siga picking it up. It is Nami still in the lead. Now get the barrel away. Pick
it up. Like, move it, move it. Nami gonna use everybody
to clear out the entire course,
do it in one shot. (overlapping chatter) You're good.
Start clearing your obstacles. You're good, Siga.
Start clearing those obstacles. You got to get
all those obstacles out of the way
so your cart will get through. -Here comes Nami.
-Left, left, left, left, -left, left, left, left, left.
-Watch your hands. PROBST: They're gonna be first
to the finish. Tight fit. You got to get here. -RANDEN: Turn. Go.
-Turn right here.
-Go. -LIZ: ♪ Nami, Nami... ♪
-PROBST: You're good. Get your chest, now, in here. ♪ Nami, Nami, Nami... ♪ PROBST:

Now turn. -PROBST: You're good.
-Come on. Go. Come on, come on. TIM:
Everybody, get ready. PROBST:
You're good. Get the chest in here. JESS:
Let's go. (grunting) PROBST:
Nami now can start
solving their puzzle. (overlapping chatter) Yanu's cart is in the way.
Can they get it in? You're good. Untie. -Come on, go. All right.
-Go. PROBST:
Yanu has their pieces out. Everybody
working on the puzzle now. Let's pull all the black letters
out. Black letters. PROBST:
First, you're trying to figure
out what to do with the letters. MORIAH:
Well-oiled victory! Then you're gonna
build an arching puzzle... CHARLIE:
Maybe like that. ...that will be freestanding
when you're done. ""Inspire""? No, there's a ""C."" PROBST:
First, you got to figure out
what is the word you're looking for. This requires
communication and teamwork and a bit of a vocabulary. The white letters this way. PROBST:
It will spell the same thing on both sides--
your side and my side. It has to be same
front and back, you guys. -So the last letter, the last
letter has to be on the back.
-Okay. Nami thinks they know the word. Nami undefeated this season. -That's right, yeah.
-On this side. TIM:
I got you, Jem. PROBST:
Communication is key. You've got five people
that have to work together. Siga thinks
they have an idea now. Yanu now looking next door. This is as much about building
the puzzle as solving the word. -(grunts)
-It's gonna fall. PROBST:
Siga starting to see that now, as those pieces fall on Tim. Siga loses everything. Those blocks are very heavy. That'll break a toe,
scrape up a face. -SODA: Go, go, go, go...
-You've got to work together. Panic does not help. SODA:
My arms are, like, really -not doing well.
-PROBST: You've got to get it
to stand on its own. Once you do,
get back to your mat. Immunity is yours. Yanu is taking
an insane amount of time. No. All right.
Bring that, bring that. -Stay there, Ben.
-I'm here, I'm here. Last letter. -Last letter.
-Siga drops again. Opening the door now for Yanu. TIM:
We're right there.
We're right there. Hold it. -That R. That R.
-Come on. Bring me that R.
Bring me that R. Here. PROBST:
That word's got to be right
on both sides. When you have it
and it'll stand, get to your mat for the win. Yanu now is in on this. -Tiffany can't hold 'em all.
-SODA: Randen, help him. -I-I got...
-You got to... -I can't.
-Come on. -Oh.
-Oh, my God. PROBST:
Nami's dropping blocks. This is a wide-open challenge
right now. Any tribe could win. Aah! Aah! -TIM: Guy, what's up? What's up?
-No, come on, come on. PROBST: Siga one letter away, but getting that letter in
and getting it to hold is a whole different thing. BEN:
Jeff, come on! SODA:
Tevin, do not give up. Nami and Siga
making a lot of progress. -Right here, right here.
Right there.
-CHARLIE: Nice job, Maria. TIM:
Push. We got to push them. -(grunts) I see it. I see it.
-Randen, it's me. Let go, let go, let go... PROBST:
Nami thinks they have it. -They're trying to get it built.
-Slowly let go. -Slowly let go.
-Jeff! Jeff! -Jeff!
-Nami thinks they have it,
and they don't. -No!
-Ah! -PROBST: Something is not right.
-Oh, it's right here... -No.
-Right here, right here.
We got to switch these two. We have to switch these two? -Come on. Come on.
-There's got to be an N. Got to push. (grunts) -... No!
-Ben... Stay there.
Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. PROBST:
Siga starting back now. Stay there.
You got it. You got it. -All right, guys, almost there.
-Aah! -Oh!
-PROBST: Yanu, another disaster. Blocks everywhere. -CHARLIE: All right, Ben.

half their puzzle.

maybe frustration from you during that challenge. What were you feeling? (sighs) (stammers) We're doing everything right, but where we're losing,
I just don't understand that. We have the strength. What we're missing is the... the planning.
I think that's what it is. The planning is missing, and we have
to put our minds together and I think we're
gonna have a chat today and that's what
we're gonna do tonight. PROBST:
Tiffany, this is what happens. When you lose once, ""Hey,
that's all right. We got it."" You lose twice. But when you just
continue to lose... -Look at your body language.
You're frustrated.
-I'm pissed. I'm pissed. No,
I'm not frustrated. I'm pissed. I have a real attitude
right now, so I'm gonna keep my actual thoughts to myself
before I say something that's gonna have
people looking at me sideways. But I do not think we should
have lost that challenge. At all. PROBST:
So, Jess, just
listening to Tiffany, though she didn't
say anything directly, it's gonna be an interesting
afternoon back at camp. She's gonna give me
a spanking back at camp. Oh, you think
it's directed at you? I think so.
Everyone's been yelling at me. All day or during the challenge? JESS:
During the challenge. Are you feeling that pressure as you head back to camp now? I think we're going to
have to talk about it at camp. I'm just going to
catch my breath right now. I am feeling pressure.
I think we all are. PROBST:
All right, Yanu,
once again, Tribal Council, where somebody
will be the second person voted out of Survivor 46. As a penalty for losing--
sorry for you-- I'm gonna keep this flint. Grab your stuff. Head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. KENZIE: We started strong,
 and then the puzzle-- it literally fell apart, like, on top of all of us, -because Bhanu has a hard time -(distorted): Jess! when he's faced under pressure. But Jess dropped a bunch
 of pieces a hundred times and couldn't
 spell the word ""persistence."" So I feel like Jess is our
 common denominator in losing. I want Jess to go tonight. There is simply

-SODA: Wow. -LIZ: I think she got crushed.
-Yeah. We won this challenge, but I got really pissed afterwards. I actually got my toe crushed by that huge... huge-ass wagon because no one
was listening to me. I said, ""Turn left, turn left,""
 and they just kept going straight and ran me over. What's the point of winning
if I'm not even being heard? -SODA: Was it the moment where
you were wedged at the front

 I'm having with Venus is really ridiculous, honestly. It's up and down. It's up and down, and I'm trying

so I'll talk later. TEVIN:
 She's, like, commenting
 on the challenge, and we won. She brings the tribe morale
 down, and, uh, I'm getting real tired
and real sick of this. I had a little bit of an issue with how we worked together
as a team today, and I personally felt like my
voice wasn't being heard at all. Specifically, when
we start the challenge, and we're, like,
moving the wagon, -you guys are pushing.
-Mm-hmm. Immediately, I say, you know,
""Turn left, turn left,"" and because there was a lack
of listening, a lack of trust, it ran right over my toe,
which could have been avoided. I'm gonna continuously
be in the immunity challenges, so if you guys
want to keep winning, you have to find a way
to, like, work with me. -""We,"" right?
-VENUS: All of us. -Sometimes, when you say ""you,""
I don't know...
-Did I say ""you""? Sorry. Yeah, sometimes
when you say ""you,"" I just don't know if it means me
or if it means everyone. -No, no, no. I'm talking
in general, I'm talking general.
-Okay, okay. Venus, like,
 I adore you as a human being, and I want
to have this camaraderie, and we have to have
this camaraderie for challenges. With that being said, she plays the victim a bit. I'm like,
 ""I'm not gonna baby you. That's a 'you' thing. I can't do
that work for you. I'm not you."" -She's a person that takes
a long time to process.
-Right. So it's, like, imperative
that we don't take anything -she's doing personally.
-Right. Because she... this is... I've learned
this is just how she is. She-she could change on a dime
based on her emotions. -It's very clear.
-Right. VENUS:
 I am a natural introvert,
 but I don't think I would have this issue
with any other tribe. It's just that I...
we happen to have two really big
 personalities here. I don't really know who she's
mad at. I guess everyone. VENUS:
 Sodasia-- she has a tendency...
(chuckles) to kind of want to be
the star of the show. Nami, congratulations. VENUS:
 And her tendency to grab
 the immunity idol from me, every time
 Jeff hands it to me... Congratulations.
It's coming back. VENUS:
 It's kind of, like,
 really rude and annoying. The fact that
 your first reaction is to just grab it for yourself--
 like, it's a bit childish. You don't want to see
a pissed off version of me. I've been sad the past
three days. Now I'm just pissed. So I'm gonna work twice as hard

I'm-a take a little walk.
I'll be back. Cool. (sniffles, sighs) (groans) (sniffling) I'm not crying because we lost. I mean, I was hurt that we lost,
 but I was just even more upset because of the way
 I lost control. That's just
 not the type of player that I want to be perceived as. Like, nobody on the other tribes
even knows me yet. I don't want
their perception of me to be this crazy,
angry Black girl that can't keep her cool
during challenges. (sniffles) And I feel like
that's what I looked like today. But I was so broken. Because it's like, you're
 not taking this seriously. And I can't work

-God, I'm so... -I'm so angry.
-I know. -It's just...
-It wasn't on you. Hey, bro. -I know.
-There were so many times
that I looked up during the challenge
and Jess was literally walking. -I know.
-I'm like, ""Bro."" KENZIE:
 Tiff was down, down and out. Like, I feel for her. It's not
 a good feeling, but I'm like, ""We lost it. Let's move on
and talk about Tribal."" -I felt the same thing.
-Like, she kept dropping 'em. Look, we can't think about that. We only have
a few hours until Tribal, so you and I
need to get straight. Like, what do you want to do? Do you want to hide an idol,
make her think she's safe so she doesn't play
her Shot in the Dark? -I feel like we don't
have a choice at this point.
-Okay. I woke up this morning
 with an idea that we could hide a fake idol and make Jess think she has a real idol
 so that she doesn't play her Shot in the Dark. I macheted off the beads
 from Jelinsky's water bottle. I tell Tiff this idea. We used the note
 from Tiffany's idol and the parchment from
 Tiffany's Beware Advantage. All right,
this look official to me. KENZIE:
 Then Tiff went to hide it. The traps have been laid out. They are...
The carrot is in the snare. TIFFANY:
She'll think she has an idol, -so she won't
play her Shot in the Dark.
-Q: Right. KENZIE:
 The only ones in on this plan
 are me, Q and Tiff. -Y'all do what y'all have to do.
-TIFFANY: All right. I think it's a foolproof plan. Like, she's gonna find it. It's sticking out a little bit.
It's perfect. Honestly, I'm about
to start go looking for idols. Oh, my God. Do you think you're in trouble? It's Survivor. None of us
could be too comfortable. -JESS: Yeah.
-I'm scared, too, like... Guess we should
go look for the idol. TIFFANY:
We should. We absolutely should.
Come on. You don't want
 to look for idols? Girl? Your name
is on the chopping block. At the very least, you should
 be like, ""Absolutely."" Not ""Yeah, I think so."" JESS:
Oh, my God. Spider. -You search those rocks
over there?
-No. I led her over to the wall, and sister's over here
 looking at trees. I'm like,
""Did you check the wall? Did you check the rock wall?"" You said you don't
think it's in this area? But we literally
looked everywhere else. You searched
real good over there? It's right there, girl. Sis can't look for idols
 to save her life. I literally planted the idol
 in the same exact spot where I found it, and she walks right on past. I'm not gonna get this girl
to get this idol. Did you talk to her? Jess is not gonna find it, even if we had
 a blinking neon sign that was like,
""There's an idol right here."" Jess would have just, like,
walked right underneath it. Should we let Q... (whispering):
Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess. -Yeah?
-(whispers): Come here. Hurry, hurry. -Okay.
-Listen... Yes. It's my idol. -Can we go over here?
-Come on, come on, come on. I show Jess this fake idol,
 and I tell her, ""You have to write down
who I want."" Okay. When I give you this,
just keep looking. -Keep looking
until we have to leave.
-I will keep looking. Q:
 Because of my relationship
 with Jess, and telling Jess that
I want us to work together, but I want no one
to know about it, has allowed me to present
 this fake idol to Jess and her think it's real. -Play it cool at Tribal.
-Okay. I told you, I got your back.
Trying to help. Do not say that I gave you this,
we talked. You go that way.
I'm going this way. We should get rid of Jess
 for many reasons, but I am Jess's number one. All I need to do is tell Jess to write down Kenzie. How do you... Come on, show me. Q:
 I am Bhanu's number one. I have Bhanu's vote. The three
 of us have enough votes. We can get Kenzie out this game. Okay. Q:

-Girl, what are we working to? This is clown school. (snorts) You have to be smart
to go to clown school. This is remedial clown school. KENZIE:
 It's pretty glaringly obvious that Q, Tiff and I
 are the only people here who know anything
about the game. And we are working with... Oh, my God. There's, like,
something pointy in my neck. ...some dinguses. Why can't something go right? Hopefully,
just go right tonight. I'm voting for Jess tonight. Not because she's a bad person,
 it's just, she's a bad Survivor player.
It is what it is. JESS:
 My game tonight relies on Q, but I'm starting to wonder,
 like, I don't even know if the idol he gave me is real. It's got this thing that looks like
every adornment on every Survivor gear
that we have. Can you look me in the eyes and
tell me that the idol is real? I found the idol on day... I tell you what.
Just give it back. -(chuckles)
-No, no, no, no. 'Cause I'm risking my idol -for you to stay.
-Okay. For you to question it... JESS:
 I don't really have a choice
 but to play it and hope that it's real. I think Kenzie's a huge threat.
 She's just gonna sail to the final three
if they don't... if they don't get rid of her. But I think Tiffany and Q
 are working together, so I don't think
 Q would pull off a blindside tonight without Tiff. Do you think
Tiffany would vote Kenzie? That's a good question. JESS:
 So I'm going
to put Kenzie's name out there, which is probably very stupid, but I need to be
playing this game as well. TIFFANY:
Like, where's your head at? I feel like nobody wants to,
like, throw out a name. There's five of us
who need three people -to vote one person out.
-Yeah. What's the pros and cons
of everybody? Who do you want to start with? -Um, I'll start with Bhanu.
-Yeah. While-while he's
a sweet, sweet soul, I think he's
a bit emotional at times. -Yeah. -TIFFANY: Jess, pros... I'll circle back to that. Yeah, I don't know
what Jess' pros are, so I think we're pretty solid on
the fact that we want Jess out. What are
your pros and cons for Kenz? Oh, my God.
Kenz is so socially strong -that if she went to the merge,
-Yeah. she's, like, so fast
getting to everybody and bonding with them. -Is that a pro or a con, though?
-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I don't know. I haven't
made that up in my mind yet. At this point,
 I think Jess is kind of, like, floating around
 and putting out feelers to see who... who will not
write her name down. We were talking about
pros and cons of everybody. We were on, like, Q. JESS:
Q, pros: tribe strength. -Yeah, so-so
what are y'all thinking?
-JESS: Yeah. TIFFANY:
It's Bhanu? I mean, what else is there?
I don't want it to be any of us. -KENZIE: But right now...
-JESS: Yeah. we have a chance to not lose. -BOTH: Yeah.
-KENZIE: And that
is because of Q. But, right now,
it's pretty essential -that we keep him.
-TIFFANY: I agree. Last Tribal,
 I wanted Jess out first, and the whole way home, I just kept thinking to myself, ""You should've
 got Jess out first."" -Y'all ready? Okay.
-Yeah. TIFFANY:
 But I'm okay with that, because she going home tonight anyway, so... JESS:
Well, Kenz joined us. -What'd she say?
-Well... (chuckles softly) -BHANU: Jess,
you got to be open with Q.
-She pitched one of you, -and it was... you.
-Q: Okay. BHANU:
Bro, this is not nice. I don't like this. I don't like
to have my name out there. I just don't understand.
 Why me? I'm giving my blood,
sweat and tears to this tribe, and when... and the result,
outcome is this? Just because
I'm a little emotional doesn't mean that
you guys vote me out. (whispers):
Like, we need to vote her out. She's playing you like a fiddle. BHANU:
 I'm very nervous, because
 Jess and I just started talking strategy,
 and I don't know if she's gonna
 stick to the plan to blindside Kenzie. What do you say that I can trust you with this, that you're gonna
not gonna go back and talk to Kenzie about our plan? How can I trust that? Jess... Q: So what'd they say about me? They want to keep you 'cause
you're strong. (chuckles softly) Q:
Oh, because I'm strong, huh? But then, at some point,
it won't matter -how strong any of us are.
-Q: Right. See, Tiff has to be on board. -You're right.
-JESS: Yeah. Bhanu, you're not
going anywhere. Trust me. I have Jess and Bhanu's vote, but the problem is this. Bhanu and Jess
 are both liabilities, so I need Tiff. I need her. I need her
to be on the same page as me. -For real?
-Yeah, that's what she said. Damn. That's crazy. -Yeah.
-Yo, Kenzie is definitely
intimidated by you. Kenzie wants me to herself. What'd Kenzie say? Well, no, she didn't
say anything specific to me. She just, like,
she'll make comments like, ""You're my number one, right?"" I'm like,
""Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,"" like... But, no, I-I do...
I can pick up on the fact that she's intimidated
by our relationship. Man, I don't trust
that girl now, bro. Let me get, uh, closer to you. Q:
 Kenzie don't like
 that I am Tiff's number one. Eventually, she's gonna
 get jealous. Why not just get rid of this problem
before it's an actual problem? Kenzie don't
really want me here. -I'm telling you.
-TIFFANY: You don't
think she do? Hell no.
She want me here now -because of the strength.
-Huh. We go to the merge,
she will get rid of me -in a heartbeat. -TIFFANY: Kenzie's super loyal to me. I don't know
 if she's as loyal to Q. And that's where
 the divide comes. Q wants her out ASAP, but is it too soon? Q:
Somebody don't want me here
and I can feel it, I can't play with them. ... Q:
 I don't trust Kenzie and she doesn't trust me. But here's the deal.
 I'm in the middle. I have two plans going
 and I don't know which plan we're gonna execute. Keeping Jess means
 I have a loyal number. She's someone
 who can vote with me, but I have to babysit a lot more. If we keep Kenzie,
 I don't have to do much work. She's a self-starter. Kenzie's gonna
 go on the other side and bring in numbers, but those numbers
 might not benefit me. I have to figure out

All right, so, Jess,
one of the unique aspects
of Survivor is that you have to play this game, live in these conditions,
with people you may not normally
want to even be around. Jeff, we have to rely on
each other in these conditions. We don't have anybody else. We have to use
each other's resourcefulness. Bhanu even cut his finger with a
machete today, just to feed us. -Like, we're learning to...
-You mean he fed you
part of his flesh? (laughing) I wish.
I really need the protein. PROBST:
So, Kenzie, you're
always relying on each other, even though you're
voting each other out, and that's part of what
makes it so complicated. KENZIE:
Yeah, it is complicated
because we all genuinely enjoy each other, but, like,
now we're having to choose who can we work with
long-term in gameplay. It's hard, but that's
the reality of the game. Tiffany, Kenzie was very
specific in saying, ""Right now, we have to decide who we can
play this game with long-term."" I agree with her. I'm a person
who-who acts off of data. And if we look at the data, we have lost
every challenge we competed in. So we would be fools
not to think about who can we play this game
with beyond the tribe stage of the game. Wow. I'm trying to think
if there's been a tribe that has admitted this
publicly in front of each other, especially
this early in the game. So, Jess, does
it frighten you that it could come down tonight,
potentially, to relationships -that people are
thinking about days from now?
-JESS: Yeah. It's a dog-eat-dog world
out here, and I don't know
that we have our stuff together to win
the next immunity challenge. We have to be realistic, and we have to think about
how to move forward. And it sucks because Kenzie
and I have not talked strategy. We've been kind of
tiptoeing around each other. I described it as, like, we're dancing
without touching each other. -It's really weird.
-(Kenzie chuckles) It's weird 'cause we're both, like, the smallest people
on the tribe, -and, like, everybody thinks
that you're their BFF,
-Yeah. and you're just amazing. Like, you're-you're going
to eat everybody moving forward. -Like...
-KENZIE: Yeah. I love that you pointed that out
to everyone. -I should've said this
to your face.
-KENZIE: It's fine. It's okay, but it doesn't, like,
make me want to be like, ""So, what do you want to do? ""Throw me under the bus?
Beautiful. Love it. Let's dance."" So, no, I didn't want to talk
strategy with you today. PROBST:
Wow, so, Q, I'm guessing
you didn't anticipate Tribal Council
was gonna go exactly like this. You know, Jess, in her mind, she thinks she's in trouble. So now she's saying, ""Okay, ""if I'm going out,
I want everybody to be aware of what is a hidden threat
within this camp."" And if that's her truth,
that's her truth. Let's talk
about today's challenge. Tiffany, you were so frustrated you said,
""I'm not even gonna talk,"" which is a normal situation. When you lose like this,
if you're not frustrated or a little angry,
then you're not in it. Yeah. I was-I was devastated
after that loss. I willed myself
through that challenge. I gave everything I had. So to still do that and lose, like, it-it broke me, like... So I knew at the end,
when we were just standing there,
I was upset from the loss and I knew that we were
coming back here tonight. I knew it was better for me
to just shut up in that moment than to say something stupid
that I would want to take back. Bhanu, you had no problem
releasing your emotions today. Jeff, I'm a very
passionate person. What's in here is here. I get that a lot. ""Oh, Bhanu is emotional.
He's crying. He's weak."" Do you know
how much courage it takes for someone to just
show their emotions? I'm showing all my courage.
I'm showing my true self. I'm authentic. And tonight,
I'm holding my tears and I don't want
to get emotional because, Jeff, I heard someone
in the tribe saying that, ""Oh, Bhanu, he's-he's weak.
He's too emotional."" If this passion, if this emotion
is making you feel like, ""Oh, my God, you're too... You're-you're too this,
you're too that,"" I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But this is me,
the passionate me. So are you saying you think
you're in trouble tonight? -Because...
-Absolutely. I'm 100% on the chopping block
tonight, but tell me where
I'm failing in this tribe. They know that I'm reliable.
They know that I'm trustworthy. They know that I'm honest.
They know that I'm disciplined. They know that I'm hardworking. When you close, it's what? -It's a strength. It's a power.
-I feel it. I've told them. I had these
conversations with Tiffany, with Q, of course,
Kenzie as well. And I told them,
individually and together, ""Work with me.
I want to work with you."" Bhanu, I got to say something,
because you've done this twice, so I don't feel
like I'm stepping -into your game too much.
-Please. Please. You appear
to be very forthcoming about who you're tight with. At the first Tribal Council, you were blurting out
lots of things and saying, ""Let's just vote
'cause it's Jelinsky."" And just now,
what I've gathered is you have an alliance
with Kenzie, Q and Tiffany. So how about Jess? Jess and I...
Oh, how can I explain this? I only connected
with Jess yesterday. Yeah. So, Q,
what do you make of Tribal now? Q:
Jeff, we have
to be very, very careful of what we say
when we sit in this seat. The emotions don't
have to come out all the time. Being able to control them
is just as powerful as letting 'em out. Jeff, the only reason
why I said this is because this is our tribe. If we're in a merge,
I'm not gonna say, like, ""Oh, they said this...""
This is just our tribe. This is Yanu. Once I say it, I'm done with it. -Right, but it's gonna come
a time where you can't say it.
-But what Q's saying... It's gonna have to stay here.
It can't come out of the mouth. I can do that, too.
I'm training myself. If Jess now feels like we're all in an alliance
and she's going home, what if she pulls out an idol
and write my name down? You see how
that kind of plays itself? Q, I understand that,
but I also trust in my connection with Jess. Understood.
Jeff, it's time to vote. You all ready to vote? ♪ ♪ All right, it is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. All right, let's party. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has

said anything to Sam. -What?
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 Voting out Sol is going
to burn my bridge with Teeny. Ninth person voted out and second member
of our jury: Sol. (sniffles) The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ No, I'm sorry,
'cause you were so close, so close
to accomplishing the goal of making me look stupid
for no reason. I... am devastated
that Sol went home. And Genevieve
 is actually the one who orchestrated
 Sol's blindside to begin with. And I only found this out
 from Andy during Tribal Council. Of course I do.
Of course I obviously do. But, like, give me a second. TEENY:
 I'm just pissed off. I don't want
 to be treated like an idiot. Once again, I'm back
in this position like I am when Kishan went home, where Genevieve has just
 completely blindsided me. I've never been more left out
 or confused or completely in the dark on what was going on. And that is the worst feeling
you can have in this game, is not knowing what's going on and being blindsided by
 your closest alliance member and having to then blindside your other
closest alliance member. I cannot honestly believe that you would not include me
on the plan. Like, I can't.
Like, it actually just speaks volumes
to how you see me, and, like, I'm... hurt. I have wanted Sol out for so long. -And that's...
-And the only reason I didn't do it earlier
was because of my emotional connection
with you. He was not good for my game,
Teeny, at all. That's why I don't want
emotional connections with everybody because I already
feel so beholden to you. And when I see you crying,
like, I genuinely regret what was a good,
right move for me. I knew there would be fallout from the Sol vote. The fallout's name is Teeny. But I did not
 anticipate the fallout being Teeny feeling like
 it was intentionally done to humiliate her. And I try very hard not to have any
 emotional connections to people in this game because
 it makes it harder to play. And when you... hurt someone and see them so distressed and know that
is entirely your fault... ...doesn't feel
like a fun game anymore. (laughs)
Sorry. Our relationship -is, like...
-I know. I just... so ... complicated. -We're so different.
-I know. 'Cause I'm, like, ""Everyone's telling me the truth
all the time."" And I'm like, ""My closest person
is lying to me."" Like, that's... that's... I'm never lying to you. I know, but at some point,
you will, and you will have to
for your own game. Teeny and I had
 very honest discussion, and we both kind of acknowledged there's an end coming for us, and it's not sharing
a million dollars. TEENY:
Okay. I don't know
 if I believe Genevieve. I'm playing this game
with so much emotion, which was my biggest fear
coming in here, and I don't know
 how to switch it off. Honestly, my head
 is in a swirl, and after this Tribal Council, I truly don't know
how to pivot in this game. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -Dude, it's okay, Teeny.

You cried. You didn't, like,
scream at people and... And I did snap
at Genevieve, but... Well, I think she knew
you were gonna be mad. Yeah. How did things go last night,
from your perspective? Unfortunately, everyone knows
I'm behind the Sol vote, including Teeny, who is holding
it against me, personally. So, that is why I need to be careful today, because tallest blade of grass gets cut, and I grew a lot yesterday. What do you want to do now? What do you think? And so now, there's four relatively strong Tuku. And so, I think today, everyone's gonna be
eyes on the four, 'cause we'd like
to get it down to three. How are things this morning? Genevieve was just here. She says she's down
for splitting up Kyle and Gabe. Okay, but Genevieve scares me. ANDY: You know,
 it's kind of funny because I was someone with zero options on day three, but now,
 strategically, I feel like I'm in a very interesting place
in this game. She's-she's scary. -She's good. -ANDY: What I'm observing is a bit
 of a power shift. In early Gata,
when I was truly on the bottom, Sam had all the power over me. But this time, there's just a different
 dynamic right now. I'm like a slithering snake,
I feel like. I am in the middle, and
I'm whispering different things in people's ears. I would be very excited

-It's... Tonight... Yeah. ANDY:
Right now, I'm like a pendulum,
 swinging this way and swinging that way, and what I really try to do is play
people off each other because I'm in so many conversations
 right now. How do you feel about Genevieve? She's a silent assassin. And then she was also floating, ""We have to look out
for Rachel."" -Oh.
-Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I don't. I've been looking for an ally
in this game for a long time, and it's pretty ironic that it all comes back
 to going with Andy. I think we're all, like,
pretty safe right now. -We're all pretty safe. Yeah.

-What's happening? I'm a smiling assassin. Like, I feel like
I have ice in my veins, but, you know,
people don't see that. People see the charming Andy, and that really is
my greatest strength. I've built a web
 of different alliances that no one really sees
the full picture except for me. And it's very sticky,

I needed this really bad. Feels like forever since
something's, like, gone my way. And been, like...
like, gotten, like, a win. So this... this is a big
pick-me-up, for sure. Yeah, it's tough. KYLE:
Yeah, I think that the script is gonna get flipped here
real soon. -You think?
-Well, I think it's pretty obvious
to many people that if there's somebody
to be weary of... Talking about Gabe? I'm thinking so. I know that it's just
a matter of time before, like, he strikes me
or I strike him. I love Gabe to death,
 but out here in the world where we have to play
 for a million dollars, it's every man
for himself right now. And with my reputation
 rapidly growing in this game
 as a physical competitor, it's kind of hard to trust in
the alliances you have because you never know when they're
gonna try to cut you short. I really, really am flexible
at this point. I'm just...
I'm looking for people. I'm looking for people.
Like, I don't want to just be strung along
for votes and stuff. KYLE:
 This is a prime opportunity
 for me right now. I need to be able to make a move on Gabe
before he makes a move on me. And Sam and Rachel
 are the perfect candidates to start stirring that pot. If-if we can orchestrate a move. I think people are sketched out
by Tuku a little bit right now. Well, then maybe it's time
for me to really jump ship. SAM:
 I would love, love, love
 to get Gabe out of this game. He's somebody who is
a massive strategic force. And it doesn't hurt that
 he was part of the reason why Sierra and I got split up. Get my revenge a little bit and
twist the knife while I'm at it. If Gabe wins, he's out
of the question completely. SAM:
If Gabe wins, what do we do? Because if Gabe wins, Kyle, -a lot of people are gonna want
to write your name down.
-Yeah. So then, do we
take Genevieve out next? SAM:
If we can't get Gabe,
that might be the move. Genevieve-- she definitely
has a mindset of, ""This is a game
and I don't care who I have to burn.""
But Gabe is not somebody who I think we can get later. Because if we don't get Gabe,
he's gonna get us. RACHEL:
 Clearly, these two boys-- Kyle and Sam-- want Gabe out. And I think a lot of people
in this game feel that way. But if I could vote
 anybody out next, I would like
 to vote out Genevieve. I think that she,
 out of everyone, is the most, like, onto me. And so, I think it's just me
 trying to figure out, is that my next best step? -Talk to me without Kyle here.
-Yeah. Is any of what you're saying
... for his sake? -No.
-Okay. Rachel, I want to play the game
with you. Like... Can you explain to me
a little, like... Okay, I do, too, and I... -I-I will air all my cards out
for you.
-I just feel like last night, I told you
not to blow my spot. You immediately went to Sol.
Like, those things aren't
helping me trust you. I get that. Here's the thing. To me, you're the only person that I owe loyalty to
in the game. And so, what I'm hoping is that we can get a Tuku out. -Right.
-And then, we can go after,
like, Genevieve, and we can start
knocking people out. Now I think there's more room for you and I
to actually play together. I agree. I agree. Sam and I were able to really
have it out during this reward, but I feel like
 every opportunity that I give Sam to not lie to me or screw me over in some way,
he still does. So, I'm open to hearing
 the plans. I want to know what they want to do, you know, at the next Tribal. But I'm also not sure
 if I'll actually go with them or not. ANDY: So, the way
 that I'm playing this game, I'm looking for opportunities to build bonds on all
different sides of the fence. And my next move, I want to go,
oh, across the aisle and build
a really good relationship with someone on Tuku. -Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.
-I'd love to hear
what your thoughts are, 'cause I think you're probably
a genius at this. -Sue, I've been thinking
very hard about it.
-Okay. -I think we could sit
at the end together.
-We could. I don't want to just
vote with you anymore. Like, I feel like I look at you,
I see, like, a partner. -Right.
-Like, in crime. -Yeah, absolutely.
-Like, a partner in this game. Like, I really want to work
really, really closely with you. Okay. So let's do it. -Let's absolutely do it.
-Okay. Sue is the exact player
that I want to have with me, because she plays
 this game with her emotions and how she feels about someone. And I know that
 when it comes to Kyle, there's sort of beef -with Sue.
-I want to kill him. That's why I don't even listen
when he talks. I'm like,
""I want to kill you, Kyle."" -He is a liar.
-Yeah. He does the ""poor me,""
the ""woe is me."" How many times do we have
to hear that he's poor? ""I'm a good guy.
I'm a dad. I'm a this."" He's so hypocritical. (bleep) done. The sooner Kyle is cut, the-the happier I'll be. I will give him back his name
on a parchment. He (bleep) wrote my name down. -Exactly.
-He didn't feel bad. Like, I can't even look at Kyle. I (bleep) hate him. Because he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. He wrote
my name down. He wrote my name down. 'Cause he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. So, Kyle-- he... He calls you and Caroline
Tweedledee and Tweedledum. -Really?
-He does, yeah. -Okay.
-I didn't think
that was very nice. No, not nice at all. ""Tweedleydee"" and ""Tweedleydum.""
Do you want to... I want to be like,
""(bleep) you, you (bleep)."" I cannot wait
 to write that name down. -We need to get rid
of Kyle when we can.
-Yeah. TEENY:
Feel like it's a good three
to have gone together. I'm curious what
they're gonna talk about. -Me too.
-And I'm hoping
Rachel will tell us. -TEENY: I know.
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
I think she will. Obviously, they're pitching
one of us. It's not like they're pitching one
of each other. Yeah. I worry about Kyle sometimes
when it comes to me. GENEVIEVE:
When it comes to you? -Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, really? GABE:
I mean, we've just gotten, like, personally, pretty close over the past few days, and if there was
somebody who was gonna... ...be in position
to pull one over my eyes, I think it'd be Kyle. Nobody's beating Kyle.
It's just not happening. No.
I'm sorry to tell you all. If he is there,
I will vote for him. GABE: I'm starting
 to have to reconcile with the fact that Kyle might have to leave this game
earlier than I'd like him to. I-It's tough because,
 on a strategic level, I know how Kyle's gonna vote
every single vote. A-At least I think I do. And so, I'd like to keep that for as long as I can.
 But I have to weigh the benefits
of having Kyle in this game and the negatives of having
four Tukus that intimidate a lot of people.
 And of all four of 'em, Kyle's gonna
be the easiest sell. Yeah. I think you're right. -Hello, hello.
-Hello. We have returned. My game plan coming back
 to camp is I need to find whoever else is feeling like they're at the bottom
 and start to, one at a time, assemble an army. -There's some stuff
in the works. Like...
-Okay, cool. -Let me hear it.
-I would like to get Gabe. And if the five of us outcasts
form a little alliance, we have a little bit of power. I think I've established a little bit of trust, maybe, with Andy and Teeny
to potentially work together. I might burn 'em tomorrow. In fact, I probably will.
 So, they can't trust me,
but I want 'em to. There's a lot of people
that are really trying -to find footing in the game.
-Mm-hmm. Why don't we
find footing together? -Yeah.
-Like... Absolutely. I never thought I'd say it, but I'm interested
 in working with Sam. I think Sam kind of finds himself
in a similar position as me. He's lost somebody he's super
close to. He's been blindsided. And right now,
 I'm trying to latch on to anything that's available because it is beyond overdue
 for a vote to go my way. -Let's do it.
-I like that. I like it a lot. TEENY:
 But I don't want to be too trusting, because my attachments to people in this game have been a kryptonite for me. ANDY:
 This character started in -a book.
-The Grinch.
-That's the only good one. ANDY:
It's the Grinch! (cheering, whooping) -GENEVIEVE:
I really like that game.
-SAM: Yeah. TEENY:
 I am having a Survivor low. I feel like I am sort of in mourning of my relationship with Genevieve. Like, I feel like
what we went through was almost just, like,
 a breakup for us. Because I really wanted to play in lockstep with her.
 And realizing she doesn't view me like that in this game is... devastating. And it messes
 with my self-esteem, and it's really just throwing me
 for a loop. And I feel like a lot of it, what's coming out is, like, stuff with my identity
that I haven't fully sorted out. In my real world, I do distract myself
 by being with my friends and being super social
and feeling like I'm well-liked. And it takes away
 from the insecurities I feel in my own skin a lot of the time, and... Throughout my life, I've worked through
a lot of identity issues. I've discovered my sexuality,
I've come out of the closet. But I feel I've landed
at a place right now in my life where I don't know exactly how I fit in in a sort of
man-and-woman, binary world. I feel like
 I'm dealing with a lot of very personal
 inner-world issues and trying to mask them
 for the sake of my game. And it's getting harder because I'm losing people
 who I care about. And people who I thought
 I could trust, I can't trust anymore.
So I just feel really alone in processing myself
in this game and my place in this world
and who I am. TEENY:
 But then, all of a sudden, I see the entire side of my bag is just embers and flames. What the heck? TEENY:
 The bag that carries my life in this game
 and all of my items... ...now looks like this. I feel like
 this is just another cherry on top of the mess that
my game feels like right now. I've been kicked while I'm down,
 but it does light another fire under my ass to get this game moving
 in the direction I want it, and... I think it's a sign of a new life
in this game for me. Ma rs ha ll s bu ye rs t ra ve l fa r an d wi de to hustle the best deals

-First things first, Gabe. Got to take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Now, yesterday, you squirmed like a worm for a shot at reward. Today you're gonna have
to be more sloth-like. Because today, you're
 gonna be balancing a ball on a wooden disc. At regular intervals,
 we'll add more balls, making it more difficult. While you're balancing
 those balls on the disc, you're gonna be balancing
 your entire body on a tiny little piece of wood. You know the drill.
 You fall off, ball drops, you're out. But if you outlast
everybody else, you win immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final eight. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the tenth person voted out and become
the third member of our jury. There's one more element
to today's challenge. It's been 18 days
without any rice. That can all change. -That's a bag of rice.
-Oh, my gosh. PROBST:
Enough to get you to the end. This is the rice negotiation. I need four people... ...to sit out
in exchange for rice. This is always a reflection
of where the game is, because on the surface, the easy deal is
four people agree to sit out. You agree,
""Tonight, we won't vote you out. We'll all have rice."" That's not how Survivor works. No, it's never that easy, and, you know, it'd be great
if four people felt safe enough that they could sit out,
but I don't think that's where the game is
right now. I think everybody's still
very on edge and very much wanting that necklace
a little bit more than the rice. Is that true?
Anybody instantly say, ""I'd consider sitting out
for rice""? Push it to three? No. The set price is four. What if two of us gave up
our Shots in the Dark? No. What if you got
all the Shots in the Dark? (laughs) All the Shots in the Dark? Every Shot in the Dark -down the line.
-Wow. Everybody here willing
to give up your Shot in the Dark on only day 18? -I would do that.
-I would do that. I don't have one. I would do it
if everyone else does it. -I-I...
-(laughing) PROBST:
I just want to make sure you're thinking clearly, because this is
a massive sacrifice from where I sit over here. The Shot in the Dark
is your last gasp, your Hail Mary,
your one last chance. GENEVIEVE:
I'll do it if everyone does. -I'll do it if everyone does it.
-Okay, I'm not gonna say no. -SAM: I'm thinking.
-What's that? -I'm thinking.
-PROBST: Sam, walk me through the reason
you're reluctant. Yeah, I mean, uh,
I'm on the bottom. I-I've been on the bottom, and it's easy for the people
on the top to say, ""I don't need
my Shot in the Dark."" But when you feel like that
might be your only other chance at surviving in this game,
that rice-- I can go eat rice
after I get voted out. Your vote is more powerful
than that Shot in the Dark. Your vote is how you get out
of the bottom-- by giving people your vote. I've been offering my vote. -Nobody's wanted to take it.
-And you're still here. They've been trying
to leave me out of the vote. You're still here
because you have a vote. And if you want to lean
on your challenge aptitude, that rice is gonna help it. If you feel like
you're on the bottom, that rice is more valuable
to win an immunity necklace then get a one-in-shot chance
at immunity. You reconsidering
or you locking in, Sam? I'm not... I'm not gonna
keep rice from the group. PROBST:
So, Gabe persuaded you? -Sure.
-PROBST: Okay.
-SUE: Thank you, Sam. -Thank you, Sam.
-PROBST: All right, let me just make sure I have this right. Everybody who has
a Shot in the Dark is prepared to give it to me right now? -Yes.
-Yes. I'll make that deal. -Okay.
-PROBST:
Get your Shot in the Darks. Be very interesting
to see if this comes back and have a little second guess -at some point.
-RACHEL: I don't have one, Jeff. -PROBST: Nice.
-Yeah, this worked out
really well for Rachel. -Sorry, guys.
-KYLE: Yeah, right? PROBST:
If you're all willing
to give it up, I'll take 'em. Can't believe I proposed
something that you were in on. I know. Survivor history here. Survivor history for sure. Thank you. All the Shot in the Darks in exchange for one bag of rice
waiting for you back at camp. Well done. All right. Let's get into this.
Made a little history. GABE: I got Sam
to give up his Shot in the Dark so that I can eat rice today. So now I know for a fact
 there's gonna be no ""Hail Mary toss-up,
 this person's safe."" It was a very good thing for me. All right, let's do it. I never saw

because you all agreed to give up your Shot in the Dark in exchange for rice. So, now immunity
is really important because you got nothing else other than some kind
of advantage or idol. Could have a big impact in these final days
of season 47. Here comes the wind. That will change everything. Instantly,
Caroline feels the impact. A little bit of a breeze. Another big gust of wind. Andy with a little movement.
Nice recovery. That ball wants to roll. Once it starts rolling,
it's hard to stop it. And the wind is gone. Once again, it is calm. You've got 15 seconds left
in this first stage, and then
we will add another ball. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Grab your ball.
Everybody's safe. You are good for a moment. Take a second.
Then we're gonna grab a second ball. All right, everybody
grab a second ball. It's gonna get
a little more difficult. I'll give everybody
a clean start and then we're back on. Everybody remove your hands. And this challenge is back on. We've got ten minutes
in this round. It just got a whole lot harder
with two balls. And if they start going
in opposite directions, it's even more difficult. -Man.
-PROBST: Caroline drops. She's first out.
Take a spot on the bench. No shot at immunity. Here comes the wind.
Andy can't navigate the wind. Andy is out.
We're down to seven. Just like that, less than a minute
into this round, we lose two players. That wind will come up
out of nowhere. Another big gust of wind
moving Sam's balls. Rachel teetering on disaster. Both balls at opposite ends
of the disc. Rachel can't navigate that. Rachel's out. We're down to six. PROBST:
Genevieve drops. She's out. We're down to five. Gabe drops.
We're down to four. This is it. A potentially
million-dollar game with a ball on a piece of wood. Ten seconds left in this round. Five, four, three, two, one. You are all good.
Grab your balls. Take a moment.
We'll move on -and add another ball.
-That was really well done. PROBST:
Well done. Everybody grab your third ball. This is gonna
be a lot more difficult. We're gonna place your hand
over the three balls. I'm gonna call you in
and we're gonna go. Here we go.
In three, two, one. Move your hand. This challenge is back on. -Teeny drops out of nowhere.
-Oh, Teeny. Teeny's out.
We're down to three. On one end, Kyle.
He's won it three times. On the other end, Sue.
She's won it once. In the middle, Sam.
He has not won it. And here comes the wind. Sue, for the first time in a long time,
with a little bit of movement. Kyle now has
a little bit of movement. Sam drops.
We have a showdown. Kyle versus Sue. Here comes the wind. Welcome to Survivor. Sue's balls are on the move. This is a battle. Now Kyle's balls
are starting to move. Sue again with movement,
and another nice recovery. PROBST:
Here comes more wind. Now Kyle's balls
are starting to move. Sue drops.
It's over. Kyle wins his fourth individual immunity. -Safe tonight at Tribal Council.
-Oh! Baby girl, baby boy. PROBST:
What a showdown between Kyle and Sue. -Wow!
-SUE: Good job, Kyle. GENEVIEVE:
That was so impressive. Thanks. Nice work, Kyle. -Thanks, Teeny.
-Good job, dude. -Damn, Kyle.
-Yeah. It just starts to hurt
after a little while. Yeah.
-KYLE: Thank you.
-TEENY: Yeah. Kyle, come on over. Good job, Kyle. PROBST:
Once again... -Yes, sir.
-immunity is yours. This is your fourth
individual immunity win. There are an elite group of players
who have won it five times. -KYLE: Geez.
-PROBST: What is that feeling? Nobody could really expect
to do this well, even though you dream
that it might happen. KYLE:
Growing up, I never really took first place seats
in anything. All I can say is that
I'm really proud of myself and I'm really proud of the people back home that give me the drive to want to hit a buck 20
every time I come out here. All right, well done, Kyle. You are safe tonight,
cannot be voted out, guaranteed a spot
in the final eight. As for the rest of you,
Tribal Council tonight, where somebody will be
the tenth person voted out and become the third member
of our jury. Grab your stuff,
head back to camp. I'll see you tonight
at Tribal Council. -Way to go. Congrats.
-Thank you, sir. Oh, boy. SUE:
 Getting that immunity necklace around my neck was so important
to me today because I've been trying
 to get Kyle out. So, Kyle big-time
 saved himself, but I can't cry over it. And now, unfortunately, we need to figure out
 the next target. Cr an be rr ie s. Cranberries right here? Beautiful and... How do you make sure your

That was fun. SAM:
Kyle, good job again, man. All right, let's get some food
in them bellies. Let's feed the family. SAM:
 I did not want to give up my Shot in the Dark for rice. I kind of know where I stand in the tribe. I know that my name is one that is frequently tossed around
as somebody who could go, SAM:
But I feel cautiously optimistic about my place in the game because I've started to sort of get the ball rolling on this alliance that I'm hoping can really take control
of the game. If we can get Gabe tonight,
that's great. Getting Gabe out tonight
puts the control in our hands. -SAM: I think so, too.
-And then we can decide. I feel like the margins
are really tight right now. -We need a Tuku out.
-SAM: No, I agree with you. SAM:
 Gabe is such a threat
 in this game because he is the leader
 of Tuku, and once you get Gabe, you kind of blow up
this Tuku alliance. I also think that Gabe would throw
Genevieve's name out there. I'm, like, it's so tempting for
me, because, like, I'm like... SAM:
Oh, I know. I want...
Dude, I want her out, too. TEENY: It is such a delicious option to think of Genevieve walking out
the door right now and knowing that she will not
 have the chance to pull something
 over on me again. And we just can't let her... -like, do her poison again.
-I know! But I know there's people
 on board to get Gabe out, so I know the timing
 is not right right now. I know we need
to get Gabe out first, and that's what I'm sticking to. She's playing everyone
really hard. -She scares me, dude.
-GABE: She got that Sol vote. I think she's got an adrenaline
kick from that Sol vote. -She's ready to keep it going.
-Exactly. GABE: Tonight, I want Genevieve
 out of the game. Genevieve put a huge target on her back when she made that Sol move. -She is smart. She is...
-GABE: That's what
I'm saying, dude. And she's been really down-low
this entire game. -Yeah.
-And then she emerged
for that Sol vote. -She's scary.
-But her problem:
she emerged too early. Right now, I feel the best I've ever felt in this game. Yeah. GABE:
 With nine people left
 in the game, we have four Tukus left: me, Kyle, Caroline and Sue. And we need five votes
 for a majority. We got the numbers, and as long as there's no funny business
 with idols or advantages, I'm making it to eight
with three other Tukus.
 And the fact that the fellow players around me
have allowed this to happen is mind-blowing. This is it. This is... On day three,
we ... dreamed of this. And it's going to be you, me
and Sue as the final three. CAROLINE:
 Gabe is a close
 alliance member of mine. CAROLINE: And while I love the honesty I have with Gabe
and I love our relationship... ...with the track record
 right now of the merge votes, he's played a better game
 than me. So, while Genevieve
 is a big threat, I'm starting to feel like
 if I vote out Gabe... ...it means that I can really start my game. This will get me in trouble.
Please, please, please -don't say anything about it.
-I won't. I won't. I'm getting quite worried
about Gabe. Our opportunities
to get him out are narrowing. -Yeah.
-And while Genevieve
is a threat right now... Yeah. So, I think
the numbers are there. I want to collaborate with you. And now that Kyle has won, Gabe is an even bigger target. I know. But you will? CAROLINE:
 Things are opening up now, but I'm still not entirely sure when is the best time
 to get out Gabe. Because targeting Gabe
 means targeting Sue and betraying her trust and potentially
 destroying our alliance. I actually think we're in
an incredibly good position. -Okay.
-Incredibly good position. CAROLINE:
 And my alliance with Sue is so important to me. So, I'm still
 figuring out exactly what the right move
to do is here, 'cause it could ruin me
 in this game. My only fear
about doing Gabe right now. Like, once Gabe's gone, who is everyone else
looking at now? Everybody is so hell-bent on cutting Gabe because
 he's just such a big threat. But I do think that Genevieve going before Gabe
 would be better for my game because everyone
will still have their eyes locked on Gabe after that, and no one will be looking
at little old Rachel. (laughs) And I think
Kyle would be on board to keep Gabe for, like,
another vote if we wanted. Interesting. RACHEL:
 And so, I would love to, like,
convince a player like Kyle to go after someone
 like Genevieve because if Gabe goes, he's next, full stop. So... do you want to vote Gabe or
do you want to vote Genevieve? The only reason why,
and in my gut, I feel like I shouldn't
vote Gabe, is because he's the only, like,
bigger threat than me. -That's what I feel like.
-Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm really nervous that if Gabe does go home, I'm going to become
public enemy number one. Right. I really struggled
 for, like, a while to get any footing,
 but I think that the position that I'm finally
in right now is the position that I always wanted to be in. -What would you rather do?
-I'd rather do Genevieve. I just want the votes
to go the way I want them to go. You know, I came
 into the game saying that, like, I don't want
to be the captain, I want to be the ocean. Like, I want to just, like, turn
the ship in a direction I want. I don't need to be
holding the steering wheel. But I'd prefer
 Genevieve goes home next. -CAROLINE: They'd be in here?
-GABE: Ooh! -Rice.
-KYLE: We're gonna eat, baby. -Rice. Oh, rice.
-KYLE: We're gonna eat. -A sack.
-Amazing. It's the best rice
I've ever had in my life. GENEVIEVE: Soon as I ate
 the rice, I was like, ""I want
my Shot in the Dark back."" Because now I'm worried. I am the most worried
 for myself. Coming off the Sol blindside and, like,
 the fallout with Teeny, like, I'm truly eating this rice
 around camp being like, ""Last meal on the beach."" Like... And it gets to you. Tonight, I have the least amount of confidence
I've had in the game. It's gonna be me
or Gabe tonight. -Right. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Well, I mean,
it's gonna be Gabe. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 People are telling me
 they agree on Gabe. Don't fully believe it, but I'm just really hoping
 people see Gabe as a bigger threat than me. What do you think's
gonna happen tonight? It's gonna be you or Genevieve. ... Sue and Caroline
aren't going me. They-they will not go me. Like, and all we can do is put
Genevieve's name down tonight. I've been the decoy for a lot of votes this season, but today,
 I have a lot of paranoia. I feel like
my threat level is sky-high. -Okay.
-And somebody-- I'm not saying you-- but somebody has my name
out there. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. GABE:
 I know that Genevieve wants it
to be me tonight. Everyone... It seems like
everyone is avoiding me and talking to you. No one is dying
to talk to me today, and maybe that's because -I'm not gonna be here tomorrow. -GABE: The two biggest targets -right now are you and me.
-(sighs) I have no idea where the alliances are. Like, our merged tribe
 is such a hodgepodge mess. There is the Tuku four, and then everybody else
 is just a random group of people who have
 lied to each other, been on the wrong side of votes, been on the right side of votes,
 and it's, like anybody's guess. GABE:
 If tonight's vote goes the way
 that we want it to and Genevieve is gone, this game is going to be
in the palm of my hand. GENEVIEVE:
 For me, this Tribal Council
 is about survival. If I can make it
through this one... And if I can get
through the night... ...the game will be wide open
tomorrow. I think I got it. >> W OM AN : Wh y di d we ch oo se S af el it e? We're always working

of our jury. (mouthing) All right. So, I want
to understand something. We've talked a lot this season
about this idea of community. Teeny, one thing
that was never clear to me is what is the criteria for being one of the people that gets asked
to be in the community? I think, in the beginning,
when it was someone like Rome, who was very
outwardly predictable, the criteria was more,
""just don't do that."" Just don't be that extra
about everything that you're doing in this game. And with Sierra and Sol gone,
I feel like a lot of plans were made for each person. After Sierra,
we'll do this person. After Sol, we'll do this person. But what I'm noticing is there's not a lot
of consistency in that. So, I'm about just
as confused as you are in terms of
what the criteria is. Sam, is the idea of community ebbing and flowing or are you trying to conform? I don't think
it's ebbing and flowing. I just think we're getting
to the point in the game where people's criteria
of their community is different
from everybody else's. Like, the criteria is shifting depending on who you ask. And I think that's kind of why we each have our own plan for
how we want the game to unfold. PROBST:
Gabe, what I'm hearing
tonight is, ""Well, we decide, but none of us really agree.
It shifts every day."" GABE:
Well, Survivor is a game that you build a community that is
destined to be torn apart. You put work
into building a community, and then you have to put in maybe more work
into tearing it apart. It's a hard thing to do. Let's talk about
today's rice negotiation. Because, on one hand, I was
impressed that you came up with an offer that I thought was so good I couldn't pass it up. But what I'm struck by, Andy, is that in agreeing to give up
all of your Shots in the Dark, you all agreed to make it easier to vote every single person
out of this game. ANDY:
Yeah, the Shot in the Dark is most useful
to disrupt what would otherwise be an easy vote. -Exactly.
-And that was very symbolic in terms
of we all agreed on how we're going to -sort of play the rest
of this game.
-PROBST: Sam, I'm curious about what
Andy said. ""We all agreed."" -That's not what I saw.
-(soft laughter) -Yeah.
-PROBST: And I'm hearing laughs.
-Eventually. -Eventually,
-PROBST: I felt like Gabe certainly was persuading or cajoling, even you, into doing this, but maybe
that was just my observation. Yeah. I mean,
it's no secret that I wasn't fully on board with giving up
my Shot in the Dark. I think it all depends on, like,
your position within the game. And ultimately,
what it came down to me was, like,
this is still a community, and it's still a social game. It's not worth taking rice away from eight other people
that I'm living with. There are just hills
that aren't worth dying on. PROBST:
Teeny, it was
a little bit, though, on theme in that it was about
conformity to the community. There was one person who said,
""I don't know."" And everybody else said, ""What
do you mean you don't know? We're gonna do this.""
So Sam said, -""Okay.""
-TEENY: Yeah. Absolutely. It all goes back
to adaptability. Like, you know,
Sam advocating for the fact that he wanted
his Shot in the Dark could have the exact
opposite effect than he wanted in trying to keep himself safe, and actually puts a target
on his back because he's fighting for the one thing
the rest of us agree on. But it kind of just opens up
the battlefield a bit more. PROBST:
Gabe, what's the criteria right now for tonight's vote? GABE:
I think people are starting
to think about who they want to sit
at the end with. I think beforehand, it was, ""Let's build the community
we want,"" and then it was, ""Let's get rid
of some chaotic characters."" And now it's, ""Let's figure out who I want to sit with
at the end."" PROBST:
What do you think it is, Sam? What's the criteria
for this group in terms of who you want to get rid of
and who you want -to go deeper?
-SAM: Yeah. I mean, right now, I don't know if there's really a clear line
of, like, ""Oh, these are the people that
I can take to the end and beat."" And I think that's going to be what decides what happens tonight
and probably what happens moving forward. Rachel, agree with that,
that we are looking for the biggest target,
and like any good player, we got to take 'em out
when we can? RACHEL:
I mean, I don't think that Sierra and Sol
would be sitting over there if we were voting out the
weakest people on this tribe. So, yeah, obviously, people are
looking to vote out people that they're scared of. Andy, if you're voting out
the people who are the biggest threats, then you got to decide on
what's the criteria for what is -the biggest threat tonight.
-That's the big question. I feel like, yeah, the mentality on this tribe right now is we're going threat-hunting. You know, everyone is looking for who they want to sit with
at the end, but I think that people want to defeat the big threats here on the
battlefield of Tribal Council before the Final Tribal Council. PROBST:
Caroline, do you
agree with that? CAROLINE:
Absolutely. There's a lot of different ways
to view threats. Sometimes a threat
is just someone who doesn't want
to work with you. Sometimes a threat is the person
who will prevent you from getting
to be where you want to be and could throw out
my position in the community. For me, I find that
to be a huge threat, and that's personally what I am
thinking about a lot right now. PROBST:
Genevieve, do you
get that sense, as the day is unfolding,
that you can tell when something's
just a little off? GENEVIEVE:
Yeah. I'm not sure if it was information
or misinformation, but, like, people who were
talking to me yesterday were talking to me less today and then reassuring me. And that's where you just
check in with your people and hope that they would
give you an honest heads up if your name was out there.
But yeah, I missed my
Shot in the Dark this afternoon. So you're really
second-guessing that. Yeah, but I'm always paranoid. And now I think I just feel,
like, a little less confident without it.
I didn't realize what I had until it was gone. -Sam, what'd you sense today?
-SAM: Today was the first day that I think
I started to feel like part of the community again. And so, it made me feel good. But the last time I felt good,
I felt really, really bad -immediately after.
-Oh.
-TEENY: Yeah. Gabe, why are you laughing?
What is it about that that is so enjoyable
to hear or relate to? It just sums up
the game so well, in so few words, of, you can feel
really, really good, and then feel really, really bad
immediately after. But then there's the flip side
of it, too, where you can feel really, really bad, and then
something just happened, and you feel
really, really good again. I mean, we're getting
to the point where those emotional swings are just so intense sometimes, and it's tough to deal with.
It really is. All right, it is time to vote. Sue, you're up. If you play an idol, I'm toast. Even if you don't play an idol,
 I might be toast. So it's been a crappy day. (blows raspberry) You're the biggest threat
out here, and we would be fools to not do this while we can. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Gabe. Genevieve. -One vote Genevieve.
-Crap. Genevieve.
That's two votes Genevieve. Gabe.
We're tied. Two votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve. Gabe. That's three votes Gabe,

-Three votes. The tribe has spoken. ANDY:
 Look, uh, Tribal Council sucks. Not. (laughs) That was fun as hell. That was blindside city. Anika wanted me out
 since day two. I wanted her out
 at the same time. It was really exciting
 because it just felt like this big plan
 that really came together exactly how I wanted it to go, which is
 a new feeling for me out here. I have flipped the script. Rachel was feeling so confident, and now, ostensibly,
 Rachel is on the bottom. I first want to apologize that
you were left out of the vote because I genuinely feel connected to Ani,
and I know you do, too. So, it's like,
I don't want you to be -upset with us.
-Yeah, I mean, obviously... I'm not mad, guys.
We're playing Survivor. -Like, I get it.

-Well, I... -why I was left out.
-Wait, wait, wait.
I know. One-one... -RACHEL: I mean...
-SAM: I'm sorry for leaving you -out of the vote, as well.
-SIERRA: I'm so sorry. -That's not what
we wanted to do.
-Because I... really, really, really want
to play the game with you. -Yeah, so...
-ANDY: Just for my part,
like, I feel like Anika was sort of a wedge
between us. I knew she wanted me out. Yeah. I mean, she did
want you out from the start. SAM:
Yeah. And I'm sorry for
putting your name down, Andy. I thought that that was
the consensus vote, and I'm... I'm just trying to be
with the numbers and be safe, and that's not a good excuse. -And we can talk
about it, but...
-We can talk, yeah. RACHEL:
 I was absolutely taken aback
 by tonight's vote. It felt like a big betrayal,
 and it's not a good reality to be at the bottom
of the tribe, especially when
 you consider, like... Wow, I really thought Andy was at the bottom
of the tribe for the last week, and somehow I am the person
at the bottom of the tribe. -This went about as good
as it could have gone.
-SIERRA: Yeah. It was clean, we didn't break out the idol, so... I chose not to play
my hidden immunity idol. Tonight was the last
Tribal Council it was good for, and I didn't play it tonight
 because Andy doesn't know I have said idol, and I didn't want to lose trust. So, I chose to see if I can use it
 further down the road as a decoy or a fake or something
to just have some fun with. RACHEL:
Man, this game. As soon as you think you have
a grasp of what's going on, -it just flips you on your head.
-It just changes. But tomorrow, maybe... I know. -Yeah.
-But it's, like,
we can just start from zero. Things change on a dime. RACHEL:

are you most threatened by?"" And he said, ""Tiyana."" ROME:
 He also told me
 with Caroline and Sue, they're not really good
at challenges, and they're not really doing
that well socially, either, so, he's essentially
 writing them off already. So what do I do
 with that information? That's not true. The more information
 that I have like that, the more I can
 warn the people that are the targets of someone that, ""Hey, people
are coming for you."" I'm not surprised
that he's bashing me. I mean, he wrote my name down. ROME:
 And if people feel like I'm the one
bringing them that information, then I'm the one that they're
gonna want to keep around. -Thank you
for letting me know.
-Yeah. SUE:
 After hearing
 that Kyle's still chirping about me and Caroline, my daggers are out again. I want Kyle
to be the first target. I was talking with Kyle, and pretty much
he was telling me the scarier thing
in the game right now is Sam. -Oh, really?
-Like, to him specifically.
Yeah. I asked him,
""Okay, well, for the ladies, who's the most threatening?""
And he said you. What the ..., dude? I'm just letting you know. TIYANA: My mind immediately
 goes racing because Kyle is one
of my closest allies. Like, it wouldn't make any sense for him to start
throwing out my name. That makes no sense to me. I said it a million times. I'm gonna play with my gut. And once he told me that,
 my gut feeling-- it wasn't a, ""Oh, my gosh,
I'm nervous, and I am paranoid."" It was a,
""That doesn't feel right."" Rome told me that
Kyle threw my name out there -last night at the beach.
-Last night? That's wild. SOL:
Just so you guys both know,
this is what Rome does. Oh, he, like... TIYANA: Really? -You think he would
make that up to us?
-Yes. -This is how he plays his game.
-ANDY: It's good to know. SOL:
 The thing about Rome is,
 Rome just talks, talks, talks, and it's crap, crap, crap. So I needed to make sure, like, ""Hey,
whenever you're talking to Rome, you got
to fact-check this stuff."" True. So, Rome told Tiyana
that you said she's the biggest threat
in this game. -Oh, my God. Really?
-Yeah. Did you say anything?
I mean, I'm not... No. He told me that he thinks
Tiyana's the most dangerous girl because she's able
to mingle with everybody. Rome doesn't know how
 to keep his mouth shut. And he twisted up a bunch
 of words that I told him early this morning
because I was trying to have general conversation
with him. Damn, man. What a dick. I am fired up, buddy. I am feeling froggy
as it gets at this point. -You don't?
-No. I'm still No-vote Kyle. I'm a sitting duck. -I'm gonna crush him.
-Yeah. KYLE:
 So, at this point in time,
all I have is my social skills. I'm fixing to squish him like a bug. I'm just gonna throw it
out there for everybody. -Seriously.
-(Tiyana laughs) I thought-I thought
I had a connection, and now -TIYANA: Wow.
-I find out that he's, like, making it sound like
I threw at you. -Mm-hmm.
-And I'm just like, -""... that.""
-TIYANA: Yeah, like, -I'm chopping it immediately.
-SUE: Can I say something, Kyle? He also, this morning
at the beach, told me that you were bashing
Caroline and I. No. And see,
I didn't bash either one of you. What I said was, you have, like,
a mother-daughter relationship. Everybody knows I'm one of
the most honest dumbasses here. -I believe you.
-Rome is now my number one hit. I ain't never working with Rome. He buried himself. Like, the first opportunity
I get, Rome's outie. Dr y sk in i s se ns it iv e sk in , to o. And it's natural. Treat it that way. Aveeno® Daily

First time getting to see everybody together. We are in the individual portion
of this game. All right, shall we get to it? -(all voicing assent)
-Yes. Let's go. PROBST:
All right, well, typically, this is the part of the game where you compete
in a physically demanding, emotionally challenging course
to determine who will earn the merge meal, who will earn the merge, who will get their Buff, who will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council, who will be vulnerable tonight
at Tribal Council. Good news is
we're still gonna do that. (indistinct murmuring) But with a twist. -Ugh.
-PROBST: Here's how it works. We're still gonna divide
into two teams of six. The winning team
will earn a meal, but it is not a merge meal because winning
the first team challenge does not earn you
a spot in the merge. For that, you will have
to work even harder. The winning six will then
move on to a second challenge, where you will compete
against each other -Oh, my gosh.
-for individual immunity, and the winner of that challenge will earn the individual
immunity necklace. KYLE:
Wow. -Oh!
-Wow. -I love it.
-PROBST: That person will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council. That person will make the merge. That person will get their Buff. That will be the only person... -Holy.
-Wow. Wow, wow, wow. PROBST:
...who is safe tonight
at Tribal Council. One will be safe. -12 will not.
-Wow. -Wow.
-Wow. All right,
there is one more twist. Yesterday, an advantage
was planted at your camp. -How did that go?
-It went well for me. Great.
Bring it over to me. -(clapping)
-SUE: Good job, Genevieve. -Thank you.
-Thank you. All right. So,
this advantage is a good one. Tell you how it works. Genevieve, you do not
have to participate -in this arduous team challenge.
-Yes. Instead, you move directly to
the second individual challenge, where you will have
a one in seven shot at winning this necklace. You have also earned
the food reward. (all exclaiming) Ah! Thank you. All right, let me walk you
through today's challenge. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race through mud and wood shavings until you reach a cage. You'll then use a grappling hook
 to retrieve a large bag containing a ball. You'll then work together to get to the top of a very steep ramp
 to the platform, where two players
 will use that ball and attempt to maneuver it
 through a table maze. The first team of six
to win earns the food and the right to move on
to the next challenge. The losing six--
got nothing for you. -Make sense?
-Yes, sir. PROBST:
All right, we're gonna
divide into teams. Think we need to do something
different here, as well. We've never done
a schoolyard pick -in the new era,
-(all exclaiming) so we're gonna do
a random draw for captains. -SOL: Wow.
-SUE: Oh, boy.
-Here we go. Biggest challenge of the season.
Come on, now. ♪ ♪ All right,
we have our two teams. For Yellow, it is Sierra, Rachel, Sam, Sue, Kyle and Teeny. For Blue, we have Rome, Caroline, Andy, Gabe, Tiyana and Sol. Genevieve with a nice,
comfortable -spot to watch.
-(giggles) This is the first stage
of a two-stage challenge. The winners of this group
earn the food and the right to move on
to the second stage, where you will compete
for individual immunity. Losers of this
walk away empty-handed. Here we go.
Survivors ready? Go! Start in pairs.
It's gonna be Sam and Kyle, Andy and Tiyana. You got to get through that mud
to your mat. That is a low crawl. You got to work on your belly
to get through and under. It is tight. Here goes Kyle.
He's good. Here comes Sam. Go, Yellow! Gonna be Sierra and Rachel
now in the mud. Blue still working
to get to the mat. Andy taking a long time. Go, Blue! There's Sol and Rome in the mud for Blue. -KYLE: Come on.
-PROBST: You got to get
to that mat. You're good, Yellow! Rome now taking a long time
to get out. You're good, Blue! Let's go. It is Sue and Teeny for Yellow, Caroline and Gabe for Blue. TIYANA:
Come on, Gabe. Once you get to that mat,
you go individually. Here comes Sue.
Here comes Caroline. You're good, Blue, good, Yellow! You go over
and then through the wood chips. TIYANA:
You got this, Sol. Thataway, Kyle. PROBST:
Kyle getting
through that quickly. There goes Sol for Blue. -Get to the mat.
-SUE: Go, Kyle. Go, Yellow! Here comes Sam for Yellow.
Sol's got to get to that mat. You're good. Go, Blue! -(grunts)
-Here goes Andy. Sam whipping through this. Go, Yellow! Andy working for Blue. -Go, Blue!
-Yeah, Sierra! PROBST:
Sierra moving through
that first obstacle quickly. You're good, Yellow! Here comes Tiyana for Blue. Teeny working quickly.
You're good, Yellow. It's gonna be Sue,
the last person for Yellow, -Rome for Blue.
-GABE: There you go. (indistinct,
overlapping chatter) PROBST:
Sue's got to get to the mat. You're good, Yellow! Move on! Come on. Come on, Rome. You're good, Blue. Move on. At this stage of the challenge, now you're removing
jungle debris to reveal a big bag containing a ball. And the two people up top
are using a grappling hook to retrieve it. Good job, you guys!
(chuckles) PROBST:
Yellow has their grappling hook
on the bag. Now they got to get it up. You're ready. You're ready.
Go, go, go. Help, help. PROBST:
Blue has their
grappling hook on the bag. Now they got to get it up. GABE:
Grab the bag! Don't drop it! PROBST:
You got to get it up and over. TIYANA:
Y'all got it. -PROBST: Sol holding it.
-One, two, three. -PROBST: Rome trying to pull it.
-SAM: One more! -Heave!
-PROBST:
Sam bear-hugging it now, trying to do it himself. And he's done it! You're good, Yellow! Go! GENEVIEVE:
Good job! PROBST:
Blue has it! You're good! Go! Got to get everybody down
into your mats. Slide.
You need that bag. Now you got
to get all six players and your bag to the next mat. (overlapping chatter) Yellow working together. -Blue working together.
-Let's go. You're good.
Start untying. Now you got to release that ball -from the bag.
-It's open, it's open,
it's open. Wait, I see it,
I see it, I see it. PROBST:
Yellow has the ball. Blue has their ball. You're good. Go! Yellow gonna take on the ramp. Blue now gonna take on the ramp. If you weren't tired already,
this will do it. -(whooping)
-Gabe not messing around. Immediately gets up, grabs the rope,
and he can now help people up. Here goes Rome. He's got the rope.
There goes Kyle. -There goes Tiyana for Blue.
-SOL: Help her! PROBST:
Kyle gets up now for Yellow. Teeny gives it a go.
It's not gonna happen. That is a very steep ramp. Tiyana falls back down. Another attempt by Sierra. You've got sandbags
if you need 'em. Sol is up for Blue. Most difficult part
of this challenge is getting up -to the table maze.
-SIERRA: Oh! So close, Sue! Sue with another huge effort. -Not a bad idea.
-PROBST: Yellow now gonna
go get their sandbags. You can build a ladder
to help you get up higher, but it takes a lot of energy
to drag those bags over. There goes Tiyana. -She's got the rope!
-(grunting) Can she hang on? (Tiyana grunting) Andy grabbing Tiyana's arm. (whoops) Sierra's up for Yellow. GABE:
Can you pull her all the way up? PROBST: Tiyana is up for Blue,
and we're down to one person left. Here goes Caroline. -(Caroline muttering)
-Aah! Close. Yellow stacking sandbags strategically. You get that high enough, you just reach up
and grab that rope. Gabe coming down.
Gonna give Caroline a hand. Andy being held by Sol and Rome. You got this! All you got! There goes Caroline again. And she's got it. Andy has her. Andy is being held
by everybody else. This is a test of trust right now. Caroline is there. Now it's up to Gabe.
He's already been up there once. Gonna have
to pull himself up again. Blue now looking very good. They can move on to the
table maze. Two tribe members. Yellow's still working
to get up. -They are building a wall
of sandbags.
-ROME: Pick it up? -You-you... you let go.
-It's got to go this way. PROBST:
Gabe and Rome
for Blue on the table maze. Sue is up for Yellow! Yellow's got some momentum now.
Here comes Teeny. That strategy
of sandbags is working. Tiny bit from you. Yeah. You, you, you, you. Rachel's up and over now
for Yellow. Here comes Kyle.
This should be easy for Kyle. -He did it once.
-(whoops) Everybody's up for Yellow.
You're in this. It's gonna be Sam and Kyle
on the maze for Yellow. It's Gabe and Rome for Blue. Okay, not too hard,
not too hard. Slowly and touch. Now it's gonna be
all about touch and working together. Two people is
much more difficult than one. One, you just worry
about yourself. Two, you got to worry about that
other idiot you're playing with. -Guys!
-That was me. We're good,
we're good, we're good. PROBST:
You got to be subtle. Tiny movements
around those obstacles. Okay. Chill, chill, chill. -PROBST:
Blue is all over the place.
-Come on, guys, take your time. Moving with crazy, jerky moves. Rome, you're being... touch
is way too much right now. Sol, Sol, we're good, brother.
I appreciate it, man. -All right.
-We're good.
We got this. Don't worry. PROBST:
Sam and Kyle very steady. They have not changed their
approach the entire challenge. -Blue making huge moves,
-Guys. playing much more carefree. Blue drops,
and they're back to the start. It is now Yellow in the lead. KYLE:
You need to pick up
on your side a little. PROBST: Gabe and Rome drop.
They've got to start again. -Is there a swap-outs?
-No. -Bro, relax, relax.
-All right. My bad. PROBST:
Yellow, slow and steady, getting closer to the center. -Go, go, go, go, go.
-PROBST: There goes Blue again. Aggressive out of the gate.
They've got a pattern. They are quickly
catching Yellow. Sam and Kyle
making more progress. Blue trying to catch them. Blue very close
to catching Yellow. Too close to call right now. KYLE:
So once it goes this way, -I'm-I'm pulling down.
-PROBST: While Yellow is taking their time talking,
Blue is now catching. Now Blue in the lead. This is very close. Both balls
in nearly the same spot. Go! Yellow's in the inner circle. Blue is close
to the inner circle. -Blue drops.
-(cheering) Yellow wins! That's it! -Yeah!
-Wow, what a finish. Within inches of each other. Defeat for Caroline, Tiyana, Gabe, Rome, Andy and Sol. No food, no shot at immunity. What a huge effort in stage one. Wow. All right, you six,
you're now gonna move on to the second challenge. Head down with me. You six, take a spot on the bench,
we'll get this going. SUE:
 This challenge was grueling, and even though we won, we have to continue,
 totally exhausted, and compete for the first
 individual immunity. Survivor is tough. (chuckles) Ou r fl oo rs d on 't s ta y cl ea n ve ry l on g. That's why I love my

this afternoon. Food is gonna be waiting
for you back at camp. But all you care about right now
is winning this. This is the second part
of earn-the-merge. You win this, you win individual immunity, you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council, you will get a Buff, which means
you will be the first person -of Survivor 47
to earn the merge.
-Wow. PROBST:
The stakes are never higher. Who knows what's gonna
happen this afternoon with 13 people in the game? All right, here's how it works. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna stand on a very narrow beam while balancing a ball
 on a wooden bow. At regular intervals, you will
 move farther down the beam, making it more difficult. If at any point you drop
 or your ball drops... ...you're out. Last person left standing wins individual immunity and
everything that comes with it. Losers, you will join
the other six, going to Tribal Council
tonight vulnerable. All right, everybody take
your spots, and we'll get it on. Here we go. All right. Everybody's
in your first position. Place your ball on your bow. Ooh. -My gosh.
-Come on, baby. PROBST:
Wait till everybody's
good and centered, and then I'm gonna call it. All right,
everybody is looking good, and this challenge is on. We'll be in this first section
for five minutes. Genevieve,
as fresh as you can be, given it's day 12 of Survivor. She is not covered in mud,
is not exhausted. -That is the big advantage
Genevieve has.
-Come on. PROBST:
Sierra drops. We are down to six. Sam with a nice save.
Can he get it back? One end to another. No, Sam is out.
You can leave the ball, Sam. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to five. Now it's Rachel
with a little movement, and a nice recovery by Rachel. You cannot lose
your concentration. Whatever it takes
to keep your mind occupied, -that's what
you got to be doing.
-Back to the center. -(Genevieve mumbles)
-PROBST: If you get comfortable, and you start to drift,
so will that ball, and before you know it, you're out, you're on the bench. 15 seconds left. Survive this,
you move to the next stage of this challenge. Get a little more difficult. Five, four, three, two, one. You can grab your ball.
Everybody's safe. -Well done.
-(sighing) You will now move down.
Don't get off the beam. You're gonna move now
down into the next section. -So hot.
-PROBST: This is more narrow. -Scalding.
-PROBST: It's gonna be
a little more difficult. -Ooh. Oh.
-PROBST: All right. Everybody, place your ball. Everybody looking good,
and this challenge is back on. You're gonna be here
for ten minutes, twice as long
as that first section. Teeny with movement,
but a nice recovery. It's tiny little moves
to save that. She's doing it. Genevieve with a nice save. Was nearly off the end,
and she pulled it back. (mouthing) PROBST:
Rachel's ball on the move. She cannot recover. Rachel's out.
We're down to four. Genevieve's ball on the move
again. Can she recover again? Genevieve cannot stop it
this time. Genevieve is out. She earned the advantage
to get the shot. Couldn't capitalize on it. And we are down to three. Kyle locked in. Sue locked in. Teeny locked in. We got a challenge. Little bit of movement by Sue. -Oh.
-PROBST: Teeny,
out of nowhere, drops. She's out. We are down to two-- Kyle versus Sue. They're side by side,
and Sue's ball is on the move. Just 30 seconds left
in this round. If you can survive this round, you get to grab that ball, and you get a fresh start. Kyle's ball hasn't moved
in a long time, but neither had Teeny's
until suddenly, it dropped, and she was out. That's how fast
this challenge will get you. Sue with a lot of movement. Can she hang on
for another ten seconds? PROBST:
Five, four, three, two, one. You're both safe, you move on
to the final round. Nice job. Amazing. All right, Kyle and Sue, move down to that final section. One toe has
to be touching the paint. Balance your ball again. Both of you look really good. This challenge is back on. This is it. Final round, final section. Sue, out of the gate,
ball is on the move, but a nice recovery. Slow, steady moves
is what it takes. TEENY:
Nice. PROBST:
Another nice save by Sue. Wow. PROBST:
Sue trying to get that ball
back under control. She's doing a nice job
of little movements to move it back
toward the center. Kyle with a lot of movement. -ANDY: Ooh.
-PROBST:
Sue with another nice save. And another nice save. -Aah.
-(Survivors groaning)
-Sue can't do it. Sue drops. Kyle wins first
individual community. My moose, my baby boy. -Thank you.
-(whooping) PROBST:
Kyle safe tonight
at Tribal Council, first person
to earn the merge Buff, and will enjoy food
this afternoon. -What a day.
-(cheering, applause) -Slayer.
-Good job, Kyle! Kyle, come on over. -Kyle!
-(whooping) Congratulations. Thanks, bro. First person to wear
the individual immunity necklace -from Survivor 47.
-(Survivors whooping, clapping) -It looks good on you.
-Thank you. With this, you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council. With this, your merge Buff--
go ahead and open it. -Go, Kyle.
-PROBST: This means you are the first person of Survivor 47
to earn the merge. (cheering, applause) -Sick.
-Yay! SIERRA:
Look at that, man. How does that feel? You just went through a lot
to earn that Buff. You know, Jeff,
it feels really good. And, uh, anybody that knows me out here
understands that I'm here for my family
and my kids, and when I give it,
I give it a buck 20, and I do it for my family. PROBST:
Well done. All right, Kyle, safe tonight at Tribal Council, the only person who will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council. To complicate things
a little more, though, Kyle, you, along with Genevieve,
Sam, Sierra, Rachel, Sue and Teeny-- you're all going to enjoy a meal at a separate part of camp. So you will be fueling your body
and you will be bonding, while Gabe, Sol, Caroline, Tiyana, Andy and Rome are at another part of camp
wondering what is going on. And later in the afternoon,
you'll all come together and start to talk. All right, grab your stuff,
head back to camp. See you tonight at Tribal. KYLE:
 I am the first merged member. Huge check mark on Survivor bucket list. Thank you. I'm really excited now that
 I have my name off the table. So everybody's gonna have
 to do some scurrying around. They're gonna have
 to paint their own pictures. And I have a pretty good idea of who the picture's
 getting painted of. When the pressure
of Tribal Council is looming is when the great players shine. Think that's you?

Oh, my God! SAM: Walking into the feast is like Thanksgiving afternoon
 when Mom says, ""Food's ready,"" and the football game's
about to kick off. -Charcuterie!
-Charcuterie.
-Look at. Charcuterie. SAM:
 I've been craving charcuterie. Since, like, day three
 out here, I've been asking, ""Jeff, get me some meats
and cheeses to put into my belly, please."" And so, I see

 After a few sips of wine, I was almost impatient in
waiting for somebody to bring up the fact that
we have a vote tonight, and we are all still vulnerable. And even though we pulled out
 this big win, it doesn't mean that one of us might not
be going home tonight. I know the big question,
million-dollar question. -Are you guys saying Rome?
-I'm gonna go with the majority. -I'll vote with everybody else.
-SIERRA: I'm voting majority.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. -I want Rome to go tonight.
-SUE: I'll do Rome. Sitting down at this merge
 feast, there's only one hombre with an immunity necklace,
and that he is me. I don't have a vote tonight,
 but Rome has got to go. Dude's a rat, man. I... You can't trust that ...
for nothing. Okay, so are we all
in agreeance tonight? -SIERRA: Yes.
-SUE: Yes. SAM:
I think everybody here would be very happy
voting Rome tonight. My concern is I would love it
if there was a second name. -Yeah.
-Are you guys okay with Andy? SIERRA:
 Even though Rome is, like, everybody's, like,
number one name that they want to write down
at Tribal Council, we do need to have a backup,
 whether Rome has an idol, whether he plays
 a Shot in the Dark. Andy's somebody
 I've been working with, but he's been sloppy
 throughout this whole game. So it's like, ""You know, sure."" SAM:
Teeny, I can't have you
getting too drunk here. You got to hold it together -through Tribal for me.
-RACHEL: Yeah. (snorts)
I'm gonna need, like, a buddy. (Sue laughs) TIYANA: It's like
every single crevice is -covered in mud.
-GABE: A wild day. TIYANA:
Biggest Tribal Council ev... Like, damn, that is, like,
an insane twist that he threw. GABE: As opposed to years past in the new era where,
you know, at this stage, you only have six
or seven people vulnerable, everybody except for Kyle, who won individual immunity-- we're all
 on the chopping block tonight. I'm one of those people, so, that's something that is both
 exciting and scary. -'Cause...
-No, stay. Every single person
on this island knows about it, and every single person
will know -what we're doing tonight.
-ANDY: Yeah. ANDY: This three-way, shared amulet--
 it's something that myself, Caroline
and Teeny agreed to take just because we didn't
 all want to lose our votes on that journey
 that we went on together. And so, the best option is
 to get these off of our hands, play 'em in a public way, and we do it tonight, and we go
into the merge with no targets on our back. I'm so happy with Rome. I mean, I think
everybody wants Rome... -ANDY: Right.
-TIYANA: Right. SOL: Earlier, at Lavo, I was struggling with Rome. I don't think
 anyone has meditated out here more than I have, and I've had
 to do it because of Rome. I have the biggest hermit crab
I've ever seen in my life. -CAROLINE: Oh, my God.
-I'm ready to eat. (exclaims) SOL:
 He's a pain in my ass, so, to finally, like, have a chance to take out the Rome show feels like Christmas morning. What are you thinking
for tonight? Oh, my God. I'm trying to think
if it won't be Kyle... ROME: The second that Kyle won
 individual immunity, I knew, ""Okay, all the seeds
I've been planting about Kyle? ""Ooh! They got to go out
the window, and I got to come up with a new plan."" So guess
 who I want out the game? I mean, there's only one person
that's been, like, genuinely mean to me
at different times in this game, and that's Sol. Sol.
So guess what I used? I used one little thing that Sol said
during the challenge today. Did you hear him when, like, -we dropped the ball twice?
-We were, like... Did you hear him yell at me? He tries to be encouraging and all this stuff, but
he literally just makes me feel like such a little person,
like, and it sucks. Yeah.
It's, like, such a... Yeah. 'Cause, like,
I already, like, have... I already have, like,
self-esteem and, like, pride issues with, like, myself
and, like, not being able to do things and, like,
you know, things like that. So when someone's, like, they're
not believing in me, clearly, -it just... it sucks.
-It doesn't help. Yeah. -I don't want
to deal with it anymore.
-I know. ROME:
 I might have shed a little
 crocodile tear here, too,
talking about my pride and how...
how Sol's been demeaning me. So, it was, like...
it was rough. -I didn't want to deal with it.
-TIYANA: Mm-hmm. -I don't want to play
with people like this.
-TIYANA: Yeah. ROME:
 You could tell
 Caroline and Tiyana-- they were like, ""Oh, man,
 that's just not right."" And as long as I can keep
on playing on people's emotions, I feel like I'll at least
be good to go for tonight. Well, I mean,
we were just trying to hear where his head was at. He said,
""Well, the only person out here who's been mean to me is Sol,
so, I'd like to vote for Sol."" -That was it.
-(chuckles) SOL:
 I do not like that Rome
is putting a target on my back. But honestly, I expected it. I mean, he's been
trying to get me out since our first Tribal Council. TEENY:
Hello? -Where are they?
-SOL: Yo. SOL:
 The one thing, though,
 that I have going for me is that Rome's ego is gigantic. And right now, everyone
 is pumping that thing up, and it's getting bigger
and bigger and bigger. Can I give you, like, a big hug? -Of course
you can give me a hug.
-Good. ROME:
 Tonight, you need seven votes to get Sol out of the game.
Kyle does not have a vote tonight. Dude, that immunity necklace
is so cool. I have a damn bat
tattooed on my back. ROME:
 There's also three amulets. We don't know what those three
 amulets are gonna be doing. The only crazy thing
 that I can see happening tonight is those
three amulets playing it on Sol. But Caroline does not like Sol
 at all right now. I'm feeling, like,
at peace with this vote. ROME:
 So I do not see that happening
 whatsoever. It's a good feeling. So, the big thing is
is to get the people that have the influence
down to vote out Sol. Oh, really? Okay, sure. That's one plan. Unbeknownst to Rome, Rome is the other plan. So right now,
the plan is gonna be Sol. Okay. Hey, that's great, Rome. You keep
throwing Sol's name around. Gonna be Sol tonight, so... Yeah. It's looking like
it's gonna be Sol. -Okay. Is everyone on board?
-Mm-hmm. ROME:
I think I might be a little bit of a mastermind right now,
 you know? I got a plan in motion.
I've been setting the seeds. Did you hear about it? -What? Sol?
-Yeah. The fact there's 13 people
 in the game and I can corral this many people
to vote my way? That must say a lot
about how I'm playing the game. GENEVIEVE:
 You guys all heard the real plan? -Yes. Okay.
-Perfect. Yeah. And I actually feel like
Rome is comfortable. Yeah, I feel like
he's comfortable, too. GENEVIEVE:
They did a lot of work today. We did.
We friggin' babied him. Thank you. -(laughing): I love you.
Stop it.
-Thank you. -Right.
-Thing is,
does he have anything? And if he does? And if he does,
we need something else. -I appreciate this.
-(laughing): Yeah. Rome's coming. ROME:
 Tonight is about sending a message to Sol,
 letting him know that I won the war. Everyone's voting Rome, and then Sol is voting Andy. ROME:
 It's all good. I'm gonna be feasting on Sol's bones tonight. ROME:
 I got a big old smile
on my face because it's feeling like everything's
gonna be rolling my way. Okay. Cool. ROME:
 Man, like, I am
 running this game. This ain't even
 Magic versus Larry. This is Michael Jordan versus Kirk Hinrich, all right?
This is... this is not even a competition
right now, all right? I'm playing this game
on a whole 'nother level. I'm on Survivor, baby, and
 I'm leading a mastermind vote at a potential historic
 Tribal Council. It might be a Rome game or a home game,
 and, Sol, I'm sorry, it might be
a home game for you, buddy. To 5 0 ye ar s wi th m y be st f ri en d. [SFX: Gasp] [SFX: Spilling sound] Nooo... Aya... Quick,

Wow. There are so many torches here. It's reflecting
parts of Tribal Council I haven't even seen
until tonight. All right, so let's
talk about the twists. Only one person is safe at the merge vote. Andy, what did you see
this afternoon? 'Cause I'm guessing
everybody thought it's a lot more dangerous. ANDY:
Yeah. I mean,
there's just this insecurity, a little bit.
There's just, like... You just want to be safe.
You want that pretty, pretty purple Buff.
Everyone wants that. And so, we're all trying to portray that
we are trustworthy, we're a good number. And so, everyone's
playing this little tango, and it's fun to be a part of, -but it's scary.
-PROBST: And Rome, you got this big group
of people, so, you're trying
to get to know each other, but you're also watching
other people watching you, trying
to get to know each other. ROME:
Well, it's only been,
you know, a little over 24 hours that everyone's
been on the same beach and been able
to get used to each other. So, right here, you got to
really build trust very quickly. And I think
the big thing today is just don't ruffle feathers.
If you hear a plan, ""All right,
I guess that's the plan."" PROBST:
Kyle, what did you notice
in terms of the scrambling, given that
you're the only one with the purple Buff,
so you had no stress today? Uh, I wouldn't say ""no stress."" Just sitting back, I can see that many individuals
walk off off together, and it happened
so frequently, I think a lot of people
are trying to fact-check to make sure that
there wasn't a bunch of phony baloney
getting tossed around of this twisted-up
conundrum that we've created on a beach. Sol, what kind of conversations
did you have today? SOL:
Well, even going back
to yesterday, like, there was
an advantage out there, and we all looked for, like,
one minute, and then -we all came back,
and it was, like...
-For one minute?! I mean, it was...
it was surprising, like... -Pretty much.
-RACHEL: There's a few people that were concerned we were
gonna let you down, Jeff. Taking notes, but not let down. So, Rome, is it possible advantages are starting
to be seen as disadvantages? Well, the amulet is for sure... seemed like a disadvantage. That's why the people
with the amulets tonight are gonna be getting rid of it
and getting it out of the game, -because...
-My heart is breaking. So, you don't think
that's a good advantage? -No, they... I'm...
-School me. Maybe you should
be sitting here. If you want to trade
for tonight, I... Rome, come over and sit here. (all exclaiming) Tell the group--
and I will listen-- why the Amulet Advantage
is not good. All right, so, we've got an Amulet Advantage
out there right now. We know that three people have the amulet.
They all went on a journey together.
Usually when you go on journeys, when you come back, you tell
your whole tribe what happened.
So everyone knows who has the amulets right now. And everyone knows that the
amulet by itself has no power. You have to use it together -with the other two people.
-I mean... So, the only options is, target the other two people so that you have all the power
with the amulet, or say, ""Hmm, I don't want
to be one of the two targets. ""Let me just go ahead and
get rid of this thing right now. ""We'll use it together. -That way we don't have
a target on our back.""
-Wow. And I think that, as a group, sums up the Amulet Advantage
right now in the game. Well done. Well done.
Get back over there. Get back over there. -Wow.
-TEENY: That was great. -That was better said than...
-PROBST: Duly noted. Thank you. That was awesome,
being able to sit there. You know, like, I love hosting, I love commentating, and you literally have my dream job,
so the fact I even got to do that for 30
seconds right there, that just made the...
That meant the world to me, man. Seriously, I'm about to cry.
Like, that was... -Really?
-Yeah, seriously. Like, that was...
that was a lot. I appreciate it.
Thank you, man. PROBST:
Well, I don't want
to make light of it because I know
this is a great job. I have the best job
I'll ever have in my life. Rome, I know.
And I hope you're not coming for it,
even though... I'd love to be your protégé
one day, man. I'd love it. -All right, for now,
we'll stick to playing.
-Yeah. PROBST:
And I'm-I'm glad we had that. We'll talk later. Yeah. All right.
Gabe, let's talk about the deliciousness
of a blindside, because everybody here has been involved
in a blindside this season, either as one of the architects or as somebody who was
on the wrong side of it -and survived it.
-GABE: Well, an interesting word
that you used in that question
was ""architect,"" right? When it comes to blindsides,
it's not important for me to be the architect
of a blindside, necessarily. What's important to me is that I know
where the votes are going. PROBST:
Rome, where do you stand
on blindsides? I think blindsides
are really only fun when you're in on the vote. When you witness it
and you weren't part of the blindside, you can
feel blindsided yourself. Andy, how about for you? Blindsiding Anika
was fun as hell, dude. It was super fun.
It was the most fun I've had out here because, you know,
my name's been in her mouth since day one, since day two. And so, to see her shock,
it just shows it was a job well done. PROBST:
All right. So, Caroline, tonight's vote is big because you want
to make the merge. Why is that significant? CAROLINE:
When I am watching the show,
and you hear the confessionals of people
talking about the merge, everyone says,
""This is where the game starts. ""This is where
you separate okay players from great players."" And the stakes are so high
'cause we're all itching and craving
and wanting that experience. Andy, you were nodding. Every single day out here
is a lesson, is a gift, is its own adventure. I don't want
to minimize that experience if I lose out tonight. But when you think about
the legacy of Survivor, you're like,
""Oh, I'm a pre-merger."" Like, that's your identity. And so, you want
to be known as someone who made an impact in this game,
and it starts tonight. And if you just miss out,
you're going to feel the FOMO. PROBST:
All right, well, one thing seems
very clear to me. Tonight's vote is gonna be
great news for 12 people... (laughter) ...devastating for one person. GABE:
Hot take. It is time to vote.
Andy, you're up. (speaking German) Come on, now. Don't ever
put my name out like that. They say
Rome wasn't built in a day, but your game
sure was destroyed in one. I think everybody
has finally caughten up to the way
that I feel about you. Oh, man. I just don't want Sol
on the jury, 'cause I know
he'd never vote for me. Dude can't stand me, so, Sol, I know it's already
gonna be you tonight, so I'm gonna
shake things up a bit. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. CAROLINE:
Jeff? I have one I'd like to play. Other people as well? -Yes.
-Wonderful. Ah. TEENY:
Would you like to be our spokesperson? Sure. All right. Assuming everyone
who has an amulet agrees, I would love to play
my amulet for Teeny. -Agreed.
-Yes. All right. TEENY:
Yeah, I can't say ""no"" to that. CAROLINE:
Plot twist. Thank you. These are the three amulets that, when played together for the same person,
do form an idol. Any votes cast
for Teeny will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Andy. One vote Sam,
one vote Andy. Andy. That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam. Rome. That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam, one vote Rome. Rome. We're tied.
Two votes Andy, two votes Rome, one vote Sam. Rome. That's three votes Rome,
two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Rome.
That's four votes Rome, two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Rome. That's five votes Rome, two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Sixth person voted out

It smells really good. -SUE: We made the merge, guys.

-SOL: Yay. TEENY: Right now, I am feeling so, so, so, so good about
what happened at Tribal Council. Rome, my biggest source of paranoia and stress
 in this game, was collectively voted out. And not only
 is the Amulet Advantage out of my hands. It was also played on me so that I didn't even
have a chance of going home. -Congrats. All right?
-Congrats. TEENY:
 But beyond that, Sol is the only known person

-Right. That means you're very confident

-you chose me. Right. -Why?
-Okay. SOL: Me voting for Andy gives me
some work to do. I knew there was a chance
 that Andy would still be here, but I had to protect myself,
 so now I know I have to
give up some things to earn his trust back, and, um,
I have no problem with that. I didn't want to do it, Andy, but they were all coming
back to me, and were like,
""Hey, Rome wants you."" I was like, ""Okay, fine,
but we have to have a backup."" Okay. Okay. -So that's when I was like...
-Who-who, exactly? It was Sam. Sam is the one who said that you're the backup, okay? ANDY: I did a lot of work to get
 out of Gato alive and have a decently strong alliance
with Sam and Sierra, but I feel like, as time has gone on,
little things have started to not add up in terms of how
 they're moving in this game. And when Sol tells me
 that they are using me as a sacrificial lamb,
 I wasn't shocked. I wasn't that surprised,
 but I was, you know, sort of woken up, and things became
very clear to me. -Based off what
you're telling me,
-Yeah. I need significant help
-Uh-huh. from real allies. -So, I want some protection
from this in the future.
-Mm. -And what I want is an alliance
-Yeah. where people are not
gonna be throwing my name as a backup option. -Do you want
to be a part of that?
-Absolutely. -Um, you...
-The next, like,
three, four moves, you need to make are just...
need to be exactly how I expect. -Okay, man.
-And we get rid of Gata. You got it, man.

 After this vote, I realize if I'm gonna survive the
second half of this game, like, I need to flip the switch. I need to take control

 Last night really
 got my head spinning because I really feel like
 I invested in those relationships
 with Sam and Sierra on the early days of Gata. But I'm realizing
 that I am a third wheel and ultimately, very expendable. Not even just at the endgame,
 but even now. And so, I'm reevaluating my game coming into this merged tribe. I feel like
 I have an opportunity to find, really,
 sort of my people that I can really roll with

went home, and I'm, like... I'm not taking a second

you know, -because the singles,
no one's afraid of.
-Yes. -Yeah, let's do something
about it.
-Yeah. -Like, let's take the game
into our own hands.
-I love that. After the first
immunity challenge, Andy had
what I can only describe as a moment of, like,
true, raw, vulnerable panic. But I really felt
 for him in that moment, and he's still here. I think, probably, because
 people were using him to further their agendas,
 but now he has an agenda and I have an agenda,
 and if we can work together, we can
take back a little bit more power
 at this stage in the game. Okay, so if there's 12 of us,
we need seven. So, if you and I always have, like, open conversations,
we can kind of figure out what's going on
and who's telling what to who. You know what I mean?
Like... I have a vision. I have a vision for how
this game could go for us. -Okay.
-And I like it. Is it good? Is it a good vision? -Yeah, it's a good vision.
-Yeah. It could be, like,
a big sneak attack -in this game.
-Yeah. That'll serve us both so well. -Yeah.
-That would be so good. In order to change my fate, here's what I'm missing
right now: a real number one in this game. I've worked closely
with a few people. I've worked closely with Sam,
 but that's drifting away. And until now, Genevieve is someone
 I didn't know left from right. I didn't really know
 where she stood. I didn't know
 what her game plan was. But I'm kind of
 seeing her, really, as a pretty good
opportunity for me to pick up that one person who
also doesn't have a number one. -I'm excited

 Right now, I feel really good
 about the Tuku women. I feel really good about, I mean, most of the women
in this game, honestly. I think that, ideally, I'm going to find six to eight
 of these people that I really feel like
 can work together, and we can start kind of picking off ""the other side,""

-Oh! And we have the power

I feel like the all-girls alliance
is almost, like, mythologized at this point. It's been done before. We've seen
 the Black Widow Brigade pull off some of the best moves
 in this show. Since then,
 it gets snubbed before it even gets a chance
to kick off and start. But the way that I would dream
 to play this game is to form an all-women's
alliance and eat all the men. That's, I mean, just
an ideal-case scenario for me. And I really like
 the ladies here, and I think that we could
 all get on the same page. So, who are... who are
some prospects? Like... Oh, my God, I...

in this post-merge sequence. But for me,
 I have to really start to weigh the options
 of if I want to continue to stay
in this Tuku five or if I want
 to completely flip ship and try to form
 genuine connections and a genuine alliance
 on the other side, because I think that this is a perfect
opportunity to get Gabe out. I've been wanting Gabe out
 since the beginning. I feel like
 I cannot trust this man. But no matter what,

you voted out Rome. It wasn't unanimous,
but it was the vast majority. You've got the 12 people that you want
to move forward with -and battle against.
-Yeah. So now how does the game change as we head into
the next challenge? It's just gonna
get a lot tougher. I feel like
we got into the same beach, and one person sort of sunk their own game,
immediately. And that's a really good
consensus-builder. That built this community. -Hmm.
-But, um, now,
it-it just starts. It gets that much
more dangerous. We don't know
who the next target is. We have to play Survivor and see what shakes out tonight. All right. Well, let's get back
into the game, then. -Whew!
-First things first. Kyle, got to take it back. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. -You're holding onto that.
-Yeah. Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
you're gonna need balance, concentration and endurance. Here's how it works. You're gonna stand
 on a narrow beam while balancing a ball
 at the end of a very long pole while holding the pole
 above your head. At regular intervals,
 you're gonna move farther down the beam, making it more difficult
 to balance and concentrate. And the longer
 you're in the challenge, more difficult to keep that pole
 above your head. If at any point you fall off
 or your ball drops, you're out. So, now that you have
the community you want, let's divide that community -and pit you against each other.
-(gasps) PROBST:
Here's how
it's gonna work today. We're gonna randomly divide
into two groups of six. The one person
who lasts the longest for the entire challenge wins, for their group, immunity. -Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Everybody on that team will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council. You will watch Tribal Council
but you won't cast a vote, and you can't have a vote
cast against you. You are safe.
You will see -day 14 of Survivor 47.
-Wow. PROBST:
The person who lasts the longest
for the losing group earns individual immunity,
and you will need it, because that group
is going to Tribal Council, where somebody will be the seventh person voted out
of Survivor 47. And as a penalty
for being voted out, you won't even make the jury. In addition, -you're playing for reward.

some endurance in here today. PROBST:
All right, so let's see how this worked out. We have Genevieve, Sierra, Teeny, Sol, Andy and Sam. Sam, what do you make
about this draw? Yeah, I mean,
it's three Gata, three Lavo, and I think this is now a team of six because if one of us can clutch up for
the other five, we're all safe. So, I'm trying not to think
too much about the dynamics and trying to focus
on how can I make sure that all six of us,
uh, feel good tonight. All right, the other six. We have Rachel, Caroline, Sue, Tiyana, Gabe -and Kyle.
-(laughs)
-Wow. Tell me, Sue.
You've got your hands out. We have our whole Tuku tribe. -Plus me.
-Plus Rachel.

Rachel. On one hand, if you lose, things, on paper,
might not look good. -Yeah. Sure.
-Five versus one. But we're in the merge.
Everybody's wearing purple. Yeah. I mean, there are
other dynamics in play here. And if worse comes to worse, and we're the group going, like, I'll-I'll do everything
I can to stay safe. I am terrified. I look down the line and see the entirety of the Tuku tribe and me. (short chuckle) So, I need to win today or I'm leaving the fate
 of my game in the hands

-Only watching,
not talking, yeah. ANDY: Yeah. -Oh, poor Rachel.
-I know. Can we talk about Rachel being the only one? -I think she's in trouble.
-SIERRA: I think...
-Really? SAM: My former Gata members and I get to bond
 with the former Lavo members,
a-and really kind of solidify some trust and common happiness and joy with Sol,
 Teeny and Genevieve. But then, I realized, my Gata girl Rachel's over there
 with the losing group. She's sitting there
 with five Tukus, the entire tribe. She's the odd woman out.
 Like, if things hold to form, she's just getting
picked off tonight and there's nothing
that I can do to save her. The fact that
that Tuku group is... five strong is scary. So, if it is Rachel tonight
and Rachel goes, I would like to see this six -vote together in the next...
-Yeah. -Truly.
-SAM: ...thing. -I know.
-SAM: I think we need to
knock off some of those Tukus, -especially
if there's five of 'em.
-Yeah, we would. -If they stay strong tonight.
-SIERRA: I agree. TEENY: Because there was
 a triple amulet played at the last Tribal Council,
 which acted as a full idol, I think it's possible that there
 could be some sort of idol or advantage hidden, which
would be massively important. And if anyone were to find it,
then it could change everything. I think someone's
gonna find an idol. I think it's gonna
be a crazy Tribal. RACHEL:
 My gut is just on the ground. This is worst-case scenario. There's just nothing you can do
in certain situations if you draw
the wrong-colored rock, and you just get put between
a literal rock and a hard place. You can always hope that
 there's divisions and cracks within original tribes,
 but you can't look at five Tuku members
and one Gata member and not think,
""Well, that's easy."" (laughs) Look, guys, I know
it's a pretty... (laughs) ...precarious situation for me. So, if you guys want your time,
I will give it to you, but I'd also appreciate
everybody else's time. SUE:
Of course. Of course. Yup. Rachel was somebody
 who has been perceived as a very big threat
 in this game early on. She's very personable,
she's very charismatic. She's also very smart. So to have her in
 this vulnerable of a position is very advantageous for everybody
in season 47 right now. Yeah. Okay. Oh. The way that rock draw
 at the challenge played out was also perfect for Tuku because it's one more Tribal that all five of us get
to survive. KYLE: Mm-hmm. GABE:
 All these people
 are in this game are tools for me to use, and having
this Tuku majority survive as long as it can
is a very valuable tool. TIYANA: Yeah. The thing is, though, that means when Rachel leaves, they have six now, with three Lavos, three Gatos. They're gonna
 come after one of us. From the outside looking in, Rachel is the obvious vote.
 It's super easy. However, I know with
my whole frigging heart that if we go back to our camp with five strong of Tuku, we are going to be picked off because we don't
have the majority and we totally blew our cover. We technically lied
 to everyone else about how close we were. So, not only are we really,
really strong, but we're liars. What are we supposed
to do with that? This kind of seems
like the perfect opportunity to get Gabe out. -Yeah, it is
a perfect opportunity for it.
-Yeah. KYLE:
Right away, I kind of was like,
 ""Rachel, you're doomed. No doubt about it."" But then I realized
 it doesn't have to be Rachel. This could be the prime
opportunity to get rid of Gabe. There's a very good chance
that it could stick. You have a better connection
with Rachel than I do. -Do you think
you could pitch it to her?
-Okay. Caroline? KYLE:
 So, we need Rachel
 to be all in on this. We need her to not play
 that Shot in the Dark because we're about to make
something awesome happen. I'm gonna be, like, totally
straight-up and honest with you. I want to work with you,
and I know that, like, you are also close
with, like, Sierra, and, like, you make good connections because I feel like
you're a genuine person. I feel really good
about you ladies. -Mm-hmm.
-Like, so good. So... my game plan that I just brought up to Kyle-- um, I'm gonna pretend
like it's five strong. But I've been itching for
an opportunity to get Gabe out. RACHEL:
 Okay. I mean, I love to hear it.
I wasn't sure because, -you know, like, it's hard
to read the dynamics.
-E-Exactly. And, like, you do a good job
of, like, you know, -seeming very tight, so...
-No. RACHEL:
Tiyana comes up to me and says, ""I actually want
to get Gabe out."" I mean, that's music
 to my ears, obviously. I'm gonna vote for whoever that's not me to get me out
of this very sticky situation. The thing is, it all comes down
to, I think, Caroline. But I know she's a smart girl. She knows, moving forward,
if we go back with five, we are -completely screwed.
Like, there's no...
-Yeah, I get it. Everyone is gonna
gang up on you. -Everyone is gonna
gang up on us.
-Yeah. And honestly, what better way
to prove that we have cracks -than to vote out Gabe?
-Yeah. What Tiyana's saying
 is completely true. Tuku is already a very
threatening presence as it is. And to go back
and show that they are united in voting out someone
who, you know, is pretty much on ""the bottom,"" as far as anybody can tell-- I was left out
 on the Anika vote and now I'm the freaking
 underdog here-- like, that's not a good look for them. And so, Tiyana has, like,
a very good point that taking out someone like Gabe
 would be really smart. So, if Tiyana can
 swing Caroline and Kyle wants to also go along
 with this Gabe plan, like, I'm in. I' m a li fe lo ng R ep ub li ca n an d I vo te d fo r Tr um p tw ic e, but I can't do it again. Trump wants a national

 and weird season in terms of advantages. They've all
shown themselves early. A lot of advantages
have come out and kind of just been flushed
sort of preemptively, or in weird situations, like
at last night's Tribal Council. And when those leave the game, new ones come to replace them,
typically, and so, finding an advantage could be a very, very,
 very beneficial thing for me. SIERRA:

It's like... ♪ Ah! ♪ And the way it was positioned, it was hidden very, very well because it almost camouflaged. Like, it was right next to me
 for an hour, and I never saw it. TEENY:
Feels so good
to just lay in the sun. SIERRA:
Oh, I'm just, like,
taking it in. ANDY:
This is amazing. I've been looking for so long. I do my very best to be chill, be calm, but inside, and I'm like, ""Damn, this could shift the game."" -TEENY: Look at it.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God. -I don't like that.
-TEENY: It was so good. Look at it. Bones! -SOL: Well, hey, we did that.
-Bones. -You guys did it!
-Well done. Look at that. Okay.
We talk out loud. This is not...
I'm not saying that I'm -going to do it.
-Let's purely brainstorm. Yes. Purely brainstorm. You would never think
of actually getting Gabe out, would you? Are you debating? Let's... I want to hear your... 'Cause, like, the whole thing
is that this is an alliance -where we talk things through.
-Right. Exactly. -Yes.
-Like, I just know, keeping the five strong
would be awesome. -Mm-hmm.
-But we can't. -If we come back with five...
-Mm-hmm. -we are screwed.
-Yeah. Tiyana mentioned, you know, going after Gabe is an option, and it's something
we should debate. And there is a fear that if we successfully
 vote out Rachel, five Tuku strong, we get picked off
one after one after one. I think you're right in that they're gonna
come after us -Yeah.
-when we're five. Here's the thing.
I think they will go after us, but they're not going after us. They're gonna go after Kyle
 if he doesn't get the necklace.
 And if he does -get the necklace, it's Gabe.
 -TIYANA: Yeah. Here's another thought.
I personally think Rachel is the most dangerous player
 in this game, and I actually think
 it's much easier for us to get numbers with girls
 with Rachel out, because Rachel's the one
who's connecting everyone. -Mm.
-Rachel is the best I've seen in a long time. I personally think Rachel
is the glue of the Gata tribe, and if we get rid of her, a lot of options open up
for Tiyana and I. Once Rachel's gone, it's easier for us to be in the mix. Mm. If it was anyone but Rachel,
I'd be down. I agree with you. Ah, that's so ...
for Rachel, man. I like her, too.
That's the issue. Guess what? Out of all of them,
I liked her the best. -I do like her the best.
-Mm-hmm. -She's that good.
-Right. Caroline does bite just a little bit, but she does have
some reservations. And since Caroline
 is not on board, it really
 is disappointing, because I wish, wish, wish that there was a way to get Gabe out of the game. GABE:
I think tonight can be -one of two things, right?
-Yeah. We can go Tuku strong,
five deep. But, like, what problems
does that create -when we get back home?
-Yeah, definitely. And I think it creates
a lot of big problems -when we get back home.
-A lot of big problems. Or we can get somebody
we've been wanting to get out for a bit now out of the game. Everybody on Tuku seems
 to be on the same page: it's Rachel tonight. The dilemma is
how can we get her to not play
her Shot in the Dark? Because if she plays
 her Shot in the Dark and it hits, then we got
 to cannibalize each other, and we don't want to do that. Oh, ... GABE:
 We can go back, and we don't have
 this Tuku majority -target on our back anymore.
-Right. And that's the thing
that I'm most scared of. Y-You know, I'm no dummy. If we were to take
all five of us back, I'm not the last person
on the list -that people want to get out.
-Yeah. Yeah. -I'm gonna be high
on that list.
-Yeah. Gabe's plan--
 because he is also so adamant that if they go back
as a strong five, that he'll be next or
he'll be the one after next-- he wants Caroline out. I want to believe it,
 but all the BS that I've bought along the way
 in this game-- it's felt so good,
it's felt so right. In that moment, it made sense,
and yet it was all fake. If nothing else, you, me, Kyle could throw a three on Caroline, and in our worst-case scenario,
we're going to a tie. But then what happens? I mean, I would go to rocks -over that, because...
-Genuinely? Well, I mean, what the ... am
I supposed to do at that point? -Yeah.
-Because then it's like,
""Hey, Caroline, like, -I put your name down.""
-Yeah. And then,
""Oh, okay. Hey, I'm sorry."" -Yeah, valid, valid.
-Like, I-I'll backtrack, -and, you know like,
""Okay, let's just do Rachel.""
-Yeah. -So, it's, like... You know?
-Oh, my God, Gabe. I mean, you're giving me
so much hope here. It's, like, the best thing
 I could have ever hoped for and it sounds so implausible
at the same time. Either Tuku
 is completely playing me or maybe I have
some kind of hope in this game, and I'm still figuring out
which-which one it is. -Well, thank you.
-So... Yeah, of course. -Can I hug you?
-Of course. -Yeah, of course. Of course.
-Oh, my God. This is by far
 the most precarious place I've been in this game, because at least
in the other situations, I wasn't actually the person
on the chopping block. If I screw up tonight,
 I will not be on the jury, I will not
be in this game anymore. And I... That's... terrifying. TEENY: No foul balls over here. (laughs) -Oh!
-(clapping) -Oh!
-Oh!
-Change up. Change up. SOL:
 I found my first advantage
 in this game. I was cool, calm,
 and I found it. And so, I'm pretty sure
no one else saw it. In fact, I know
nobody else saw it. Otherwise, they would have
 said something. Home run! SOL:
 So now, I'm gonna have to put on
 my Oscar-winning performance and go off all by myself, because in this game,
 secrets are very, very rare. But for me,
 I'm keeping it to myself. So right now, no one else knows in this game
what I'm about to pull. Come on, come on. What is it? What is it? What is it? -Oh.
-(whooping, clapping,
chatter in distance) Oh. (laughs) I got a lot of power right now. I finally get to use an advantage
in this game and change the outcome
of some things. Oh, my God.
That's gonna be so great. What this advantage does
is it gives someone the opportunity
to block a vote. Which is simply, if someone
 writes a vote, you can say, ""Nope, that's not gonna count."" Or they can have
Safety without Power. So, in the middle
of Tribal Council, they can literally just
leave Tribal Council, go back to camp,
and they're safe. I got to think about this. It's a good day, baby. Oh, I just want go to Tribal. Oh, my God.
It's close to sundown. CAROLINE:
I think we're leaving soon. I want to go
to Tribal right now. -Like, right now. I can't.
-SUE: I can't think of that now. Like, I'm...
Like, my entire body is just... -I just want
to get it over with.
-Yeah. SOL:
 This is a big decision, and I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do yet. I could give it to Rachel,
 but I'm not sure if that's actually good
 for my game. And if I don't give it
 to Rachel, then I could build
 incredible bonds with someone on the Tuku tribe and have another option
 to get to the end. Ultimately, what it's gonna come down to
is what's gonna help my game. I want to help somebody else, but this decision is based
 on what's best for me. My heart is beating
 very, very fast, and I just can't wait
 to get it going. It should be an incredible,

So, last Tribal Council, we had everybody-- 13 people. Now we're back down
to small numbers. Six people chosen randomly,
and we had the most lopsided draw
we could have with five Tuku-- the most people left
in the game from one tribe-- and Rachel.
On top of it, you have to make this decision
in front of six people who can just watch
because they're not in trouble. They don't vote.
But, man, they can observe. All right, so let's
look at the obvious. If there was
no emotion or gameplay and it was just numbers, this would be easy:
take out Rachel. But any time you hear the word
""easy"" on Survivor, you should be terrified,
because Survivor is never easy. Caroline, five Tuku. Maybe this is a time
to make a move. Maybe you don't want
to be part of all five Tuku. Here's an opportunity, because
you have Rachel as a vote. Oh, I can guarantee you that was
running through people's minds. We have to realize
numbers are numbers, and it's gonna look threatening. But it sucks, 'cause I see
pros and cons both ways, and it's hard to figure out which one is gonna
hurt my game less. PROBST:
Gabe, one of the premises
of Survivor is numbers.
You got to have the numbers. But if you have
too many numbers, then you got to get rid
of some of the numbers because too many
looks threatening. GABE:
I look around and I see the five people that I've been with
for 13 days so far. And I know, on the surface,
it looks simple, but any of those
five people might say, ""Tonight's a hell of a night
to make one of those moves."" PROBST:
So, Rachel, the minute
the challenge ended and you had lost and you knew
you were coming here, you could not
have predicted to hear, ""Oh, Rachel's not a for-sure. There are opportunities
all over the place."" RACHEL:
I mean, yeah. This rock draw, nobody can deny
that this is, like, the worst-case scenario. Um, but I don't know if Gabe is blowing smoke
up my ass right now. If you're actually a tight five, and you're trying
to stay together, the plan would be to convince me
that you have cracks, and to get me not
to play my Shot in the Dark. So, it's scary. It's not been
an easy day for me. PROBST:
Kyle, once again, you have individual immunity,
and it does give you just a little bit of breath that you can stand back and say,
""I'm noticing some things."" What'd you see? Yeah, so,
Rachel did a good job today. I mean, she took time
to pull everybody aside. She talked in groups, she went on solo adventures
with people. She did her job,
trying to find cracks, and may have found some, and...
and she did her little wiggle. PROBST:
Tiyana, I find it fascinating
that you have five Tuku members, all maybe
independently thinking, ""How could I use Rachel?"" You really just put
our pickle on blast, Jeff. That's exactly what I've been
thinking all day long because this is a very important vote.
Like, being able to make the jury,
for me, personally, it just means
the absolute world, and I know it means the world
to everybody here. So, I got to go with my gut, and honestly,
with the vote tonight, I'm just hoping that
I send a message to the people that
I really trust that I can be worked with
and I'm someone that can be trusted in an alliance. PROBST:
Caroline, tell me more about the importance
of making the jury. I think
the universal feeling that I want to say almost every
single Survivor player has who actually cares
about the game-- you want to have an impact
on the game. It's not that we're sitting here
dreaming of being on the jury, but we're dreaming
of having an absolute, tangible, irrefutable piece of evidence that we made an impact
on this game. PROBST:
All right. So, Rachel,
for you, this afternoon, the subject line is easy. ""Vote, vote, vote. I'm a vote."" But you're not just a vote. You want this vote
to have some impact tomorrow. RACHEL:
Well, I think sometimes in Survivor, you can plan three steps ahead and sometimes you just
have to get through the night. And today was one of those days where I just had
to get through the night. And so, today was anybody else that
I can possibly, like, hope that these people want
to vote out that isn't me. PROBST:
When you went
from person to person, was your hope meter undulating? Oh, it undulated.
There was some chaos. There was some paranoia.
There were stories that were not
cross-checking, and this has been the hardest day
of Survivor for me. PROBST:
So, Sue, given
where we are in the game, and all the uncertainty,
maybe the five Tuku, for tonight, take out Rachel.
That's the easy move. ""And we all make the jury
and we'll figure it out."" Yeah, that is the easiest move, and it's almost like
the most obvious move. But, you know,
I learned real quick, this game basically changes
almost on the hour. You can't predict anything. You can say, ""Okay,
I'm set in stone this way."" Next thing you know,
you're totally flip-flopped. So it's just, like,
my head is spinning. It's really, really... This is
very difficult for me tonight. PROBST:
Tiyana, part of playing Survivor is making a move, but also, maybe
to not make a move. Is that part of the discussion
that Tuku was having? ""We could just vote out Rachel""? Oh, absolutely,
That was always an option. I mean, just look
at five versus one. It kind of seems like
the obvious option, but you want to make big moves because if I just go for it
and I swing for the fences and it doesn't work out,
at least I know I went for it. What happens if tomorrow,
I didn't take that chance and I go home with regrets? That is, like,
my biggest nightmare from this entire experience
is going home with any regrets. This is your shot.
This is your opportunity. You got to go for it
or you're gonna miss it. PROBST:
Caroline, the risk is the Tuku five blow it tonight. You had five.
This was easy. And you make a move
and it was a little too soon. I think you're hitting
the nail on the head. In the new era, there's such
an emphasis on big moves, and granted,
big moves win you the game, but it's big, smart moves. There's a very big distinction
between a big move that changes things in a way that's
not good for you, in a way that
blows up your game. And that's what
I'm playing my game on, is what are the smart moves
that I can make? Sometimes they're not
always flashy, but I'm making the moves
that are best for my game and for my alliance. PROBST:
So, Rachel, it all centers around you. The Tuku five are in charge. The question is
can you find a way to get at least one or two
of them to come with you and try to make a move?
What's the feeling? Is it optimistic,
pessimistic or hopeful? You know, um, still anxious,
but anxiously hopeful. I think that I know
what the plan is tonight, and I think that
I'm a part of that plan, and I have given my word
that I'm gonna do something and I intend to do it and I just really hope that no one's giving me a shakedown. PROBST:
Gabe, concerning at all
that Rachel's saying, ""Hey, man, I was told there's
a plan and I'm a part of it and if it works,
I'm gonna be here tonight""? Well, I mean, it's concerning if you don't know
what that plan is. And depending on what
perspective you look at it on, Rachel could be
totally helpless, drowning in the water,
hoping somebody grabs her hand. But if she can sow enough
discord between all of us, all of a sudden,
Rachel might be sitting on top of the mountain saying, ""I'm choosing
who's going home tonight."" And that's a pretty crazy thing
to think about when you really
dig deep into it. So, as we get ready
for the vote, it seems like it is
a very simple question. ""Will the Tuku five
stick together or are the Tuku five going
to turn on each other?"" All right, it is time to vote. -Sue.
-Jeff? Um, about 20 minutes--
and I mean 20 minutes-- before we left for Tribal, I found a scroll in my bag.
And when I ran into the woods to read it, I discovered that somebody sent me... an advantage... only good for tonight. PROBST:
Rachel, read
your advantage for me. Sorry.
My hands are shaking. (short chuckle) ""When Jeff says
it's time to vote, announce that you have the
Safety without Power Advantage."" ""You will leave
Tribal Council immediately. ""You will not cast a vote but more importantly,
you cannot be voted out."" So, I hope that
you all understand. My husband gave me
a couple words of wisdom before I came out here
and one of them was, ""Do not go home with
something in your pocket."" So, assuming I was
getting strays tonight, this is a lifeline, and
thank you to whoever sent it. PROBST:
All right. So, Rachel's playing the Safety without Power.

It's tough to watch someone you love go. It's got me kind of
in an emotional funk right now, the fact that Gabe went home, and that I played a part in that
because I really enjoyed Gabe as a person. -It'll be okay.
-Yeah. But Gabe's threat level
 has been climbing, along with mine, so I have to
 draw a line in the sand and say, ""Hey, I'm gonna hit you ""before you hit me and make sure it sticks."" So now, back at camp,
 I don't trust anybody. I feel like I need
 to win every single immunity after this in order
to ensure the fact that I'm still going to be here. (mutters) Thank you. Tribal really sucked tonight. They really blindsided Gabe, big-time.
 It sucks. And the whole tribe knew
except for me. TEENY:
Thanks for getting
the fire going, guys. -CAROLINE: Wow.
-GENEVIEVE: Gorgeous. You guys are miracle workers. SUE:
 I feel crushed. I can't even trust
 Caroline anymore. Something like that really lights the fire
under my rear end to, like, really start taking down
 everyone, but especially Kyle. I can't believe he's still here.
 That just-- ew-- turns my stomach more than him
writing my name down. Like, I just... I want write his name down
for Gabe. And I can't wait for that day. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ TEENY:
All right, what are the odds
the sun comes out today? Is the rain stopping? SUE:
 Last night, it was tough. It was pouring rain. Winds are blowing,
we're shivering, freezing. And you're just...
 you're miserable. You're frozen.
 You don't want to talk. You just want to, like,
 cower up, and I kept praying for a little of the heat
from that fire to come my way. -RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. SUE:
 But the worst thing is that Gabe's gone. My security blanket, my... You know, my number one
from day one, gone, and now, I'm miserable, I'm all alone. It-It's a tough, tough, tough environment to be in. SUE: I'm okay. It's just... CAROLINE:
 Last night, blindsiding Sue was maybe a huge mistake. I knew that there was a chance
 she was just gonna be like, ""You're on my hit list,
you're out. ""You betrayed me.
I thought I could trust you. I can't trust anyone.
Our relationship is over."" I hated taking that chance, but I knew that,
 from the bottom of my heart, this is the game I need to play. So, I need to talk to her.
I need to make sure she understands
why I did that vote. I felt my only true friends
were you and Gabe. I just don't like
non-loyal people. That's just who I am.
It's not that I don't like you, but, you know, it's just... -You can see, I'm loyal.
-Yeah. Yeah. -I want to explain
one thing to you.
-Mm-hmm, yeah. This is not in any way making me
feel like I am not loyal to you. But I kept feeling like I was
making decisions good for Gabe. And I started feeling like
I didn't have any control -over my own game.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm. I felt like I waited
my whole life for this -just to do what someone else
was telling me to do.
-Exactly. And I was like, ""That, to me... ""I will go home earlier
and play my game ""than make it to the end feeling
like someone's carried me, -and I just sat around.""
-Right. Right. CAROLINE:
 Gabe had a vision of me, that he was gonna
 bring me to the end, and I will have done no strategy
 of my own, just followed along with him,
and he gets to take the credit for a lot of the moves. That is never the game
I was going to play. I wanted to be on Survivor ever since I was five years old. Like, this is my biggest
life dream. That's what
I care about the most. I feel like my goal out here is to play a game
that I'll be proud of. Like, I'll be able to rewatch it -and be, like,
as, like, a little girl.
-Yeah. Like, I proved
to that little girl, -like, I did,
and I was so proud of myself.
-Mm-hmm. CAROLINE:
 I have ADHD, and the way it, like,
 impacted me as a kid is, I just felt like
 I was constantly failing. So the way I internalized that
 growing up is I was like, ""I'm just dumb,"" because I grew up
saying I would do something and then I would get distracted, or I couldn't will myself
to do something. And I felt like a failure. And so I feel like
I've just lived my life just trying to prove to myself
that I'm not that failure. Resilience was all I had, and Survivor was experience
 where I could see how great it is
if you persevere. And what's crazy is, I feel like that is what has been
 pushing me in this game. -I want to go
to final two with you.
-Right. And we complete each other.
It's weird, but we do. And you're my number one. -You're my number one girl.
-You're my 100% number one. SUE:
Even though Caroline voted Gabe, I feel like she came to me and
sort of gave me an olive branch, and that's all I needed. I feel good with her. I still feel we're number one
and number two together. And now, this is our time
 to take control of this game. We're at eight,
and we're the tightest three. We are, like,
a three-person alliance. -All we have to do...
-We are locked in.
-Yes. Yes. Like, for final three, all we have to do
is play our cards right. TEENY:
Yeah. ANDY:
Sound, yeah. -CAROLINE: Hello. Hello.
-Hi.
-SUE: Hello. ANDY:
Good morning. How's everyone feeling
this morning? -ANDY: How are we feeling?
-Okay. RACHEL: I think that
 having Gabe not here anymore opens the door to kind of these, like,
endgame strategies that we're all looking
to start creating right now. -It was a hard vote last night.
-ANDY: It was hard.
-I know. -Mm-hmm.
-TEENY: But I don't want you
to feel -worried about, like...
-Thank you. Thank you. I was grateful
that it wasn't me. RACHEL:
Yeah. It wasn't you. Yeah. I feel, like, good about this group
standing here -SUE: Yeah.
-TEENY: Me, too.
-um, moving forward. ANDY:
I really do, as well. This is really good, I think, because that leaves
Genevieve, Sam, Kyle. -RACHEL:
Underdog alliance, guys.
-SUE: Yeah. I love an un...
good underdog story. -RACHEL: Yes.
-ANDY: Yeah. This is what I've wanted since
the start. I really mean it. RACHEL:
 I am trying to build a group
 to go to the end with. I think that my best options in this game are a playing field that
 does not include Genevieve, Sam or Kyle. I think the remaining
 five players-- we all have a fighting chance
against each other, um, if it comes down
to the five of us at the end. I'm sure you would probably want
Genevieve out sooner than later -since you've already
written her name down.
-Um... I... You know, I...
I-I'm, like... The only person I want... -I am targeting
right now is Kyle.
-ANDY: Yeah. We can decide whichever one of
them we want for the next three. ANDY:
Let's just do it. Depending on who wins,
that'll affect the order. But, like, we can get
to five with our... -Oh. This is getting me excited.
-CAROLINE: Yes. -ANDY: Let's go.
-I pray for one of us.
-Yes. -Absolutely. -ANDY: I'm in a real good
 position. With Gabe gone, we pull in Caroline and Sue. That's a five. That's a majority at eight. And we collaborated
at the water well. We're just like, ""Yeah. We stick
together, we run this game."" Li be rt y Mu tu al c us to mi ze d my c ar i ns ur an ce so I saved hundreds. With the money I saved I thought I'd get a

One more week, man. But we're down to eight. There are people who scare me
in terms of jury votes... -SAM: Yeah.
-more than you guys. SAM:
Are we worried that
those five are gonna just, like, try and pick off
the three of us? -KYLE: Yeah, a little bit.
-CAROLINE: I think so. KYLE: I think we're the three
big, sitting threats. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
As soon as one of us goes, we're then at the mercy
of who wants to save us. SAM:
Yeah. KYLE:
I mean, I want to protect
the biggest threats of the game, and you two are the
biggest threats in this game. -SAM: Yeah.
-Like, you're the people -I want to go the distance with.
-Yeah. I had an interesting
conversation with Kyle and Sam. But I don't like
 using the word ""alliance"" or even saying, like, ""I trust people"" or ""I'm close
to people"" because I don't-- I genuinely don't feel
any of those connections to anyone out here by design. Like, if there are people
who everyone wants to sit with, maybe we just
take out those people. In real life,
 I love connecting with people, and I'm, like, an open book. And in the game, I made quick connection with Kishan.
 And as he left, his parting words
to me were, -""Genevieve, I trusted."" -Genevieve, I trusted you. GENEVIEVE:
 And from that moment on,
I realized, like, that's the power that
connections have in this game, and I don't want that power. You know,
 I'd rather be a villain that people didn't connect with than the best friend who killed their dream. You know? I think it's all just the game, -like, nothing personal.
-SAM: It's very easy for any of us three, I think, to pick off the other two
with that five, but then you're sitting at six, and I don't know where any of us
are getting numbers from. GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, I agree with you. I don't have anyone
that I feel like -would be solid at that point.
-Like, I feel like if you... If-if you go and you go,
I'm at six, but I'm the easy next target. The beginning of this game,
 I was deceptive, I was a liar, I was in control, and that's kind of how
I kept my power. After Sierra got voted out, I had all of my power
in this game stripped from me. And since then,
 I've had to pivot my approach and really come to people with full, open honesty, and that's when
 they first start to trust you. Who would have thought
that just telling the truth worked pretty well
on Survivor sometimes? KYLE: I-I'm not gonna lie. I wanted... It's, like, there was an emotional part
of me that did not want -to write Gabe's name down.
-GENEVIEVE: Totally. Totally. But last time that I voted with my emotions instead of a strategy, it hurt my inner game for somebody that was no longer
part of the game. -GENEVIEVE: Yeah.
-And so I had
to separate that last night. In the beginning, I had a hard time separating
 my emotions from the game. But I'm realizing now
 that you have to be able to separate your emotions
and who you were, and you need to be able to adapt
and be somebody that you need to be out here
if you want to go the distance. They've been pitching my name
for a while now. -GENEVIEVE: Yeah.
-So I'm not really bonded. Yeah. KYLE:
 In my younger years when I was being put through the ringers left and right, you know, different foster cares,
 different school systems, sometimes I had to be somebody
 that I didn't want to be. And over the years, I've let
 that part of me go dormant. But I do have the ability to lie, I do have the ability
to manipulate, and I do have the ability
to deceit. -It's very different.
-(Kyle laughs) KYLE:
Yeah. And it's, like, I try to make my family proud
when I'm here. But there's major potential of my kids and my family
seeing me be somebody that I... I don't want to be. -ANDY: I do think
you're making them proud.
-KYLE: Thank you. I don't think you're doing
anything that's out of bounds. 'Cause everyone knows,
when you watch this show, -you know what it's about.
-Yeah. (clears throat)
Doesn't make it easy, though. I've learned a lot
 about myself coming out here. I am a numbers guy,
 but I can't just sit here and algorithmically determine
the correct path because there is
so much variance. And all this variance comes
 from the people themselves. People are tricky
 because they have all these different priorities,
 and not everyone out here is a AI agent playing to optimize
their win condition. It's wild to think about. And it's just all coming
to a head in a week. -Yeah.
-It's unbelievable. An unbelievable thought. But now I'm at the final eight, and I do have all
 these amazing relationships. Now I look at Sam, I look
 at Kyle, I look at Genevieve. I'm the one with the best
relationships with each of them. Now I have the power, and I can
 look at this as my game board, and I can arrange the pieces
 how I want them to go. And so, I'm in a crushing position
in this game. TEENY: Oh. -Oh, my.
-There's a boat. TEENY:
Wow. SAM:
Boat! Oh! All of a sudden, we hear a boat down on the beach. And a boat means that, usually, somebody is getting on it,
 going on a journey, and has the chance to either
earn an advantage in this game or lose their vote. Gather round, gather round. TEENY:
 And with eight votes left, all you need is five people
 for a majority. So, whoever goes on this journey--
a lot is at stake. I've never been on a journey,
so I would want to. I've been on two, so I won't. I've been on a journey,
I'm good not going. I know Genevieve wants
 to go on this journey, but I'm perceived as a pretty
 big threat within this group. So it's high-risk, high-reward. But for where my game is right
now, I want to get on the boat. Can we do that? Anybody else want
to draw a rock? SAM:
You're staying? You're staying? -I'm staying.
-I'm staying. -All right, I'll go.
-You're gonna draw? Yeah, I'll draw. I don't really feel like I need to go on this journey. I don't really want a target
on my back. But the thing that I really
 don't want is Sam or Genevieve getting some kind of power because they're two
 of the three people that I am not working with
that are left in this game. All right, reveal. -All right, palms up.
-Two, three. (cheering) RACHEL:
 Lo and behold,
 I have the purple rock. I'm a little nervous
about what people will perceive is gonna happen
and what I might get. And so, there's this element of risk that you have
to be willing to take on. But I think what I've learned
 throughout this game is that I can just trust myself.
 And, so, hopefully, it will not come back
to bite me in the butt. Sh op K oh l' s Bl ac k Fr id ay d ea ls ! Get Levi's jeans, Sephora at Kohl's fragrances, And home favorites for less! Plus, earn extra Kohl's Cash, Take 15% off some

to the middle of the damn ocean, and I'm coming up to this barge, and I'm just like,
""That can't be it."" You know, like,
it's in the middle of the ocean. Like, that's not a thing.
That's not what a journey is. When I realized that
 that was my destination, I became very nervous about what the hell
this could be about. ""Today you have a chance
to earn an advantage ""and it all revolves
around a simple puzzle. ""Slide the balls
 into the columns ""so that all the colors match, ""and your advantage will be free
 for the taking. ""But there is one more layer ""that will complicate things. ""The puzzle is tied to a rope ""and the rope is connected
 to a series of weights. ""The weights are going
to pull the rope into the ocean. ""You must finish the puzzle
 before the last weight ""pulls the puzzle
and your advantage off the deck ""and into the water. ""If you do not complete
the puzzle in time, ""you will not participate in the vote
at the next Tribal council."" Oh, my God. This is crazy. Well, it is simple, I guess, but I have no idea
how much time I have. The point of the game is to get all the balls in every column
 to be the same color. So I understand
 the concept of this game, and I think that anybody
could do it with enough time. But the question is, like, can I move fast enough
that I will not run out of time before I complete it? That's very scary, and I hope
I can get this done, um, 'cause I want to know
what's in that box before it just sinks
to the bottom of the ocean. This is the perfect example
 of games that I like to do at home with myself
 where I'm like, ""Okay, we're gonna set a timer and we're gonna
see what we can do."" The stakes are much higher. And so, I'm going to have to see if I can turn off that
 part of my brain that's like, ""This is big stakes
 in Survivor,"" and just play
the fun little game that's set in front of me. ♪ ♪ ... This is a very intense timer.
 I can hear, the whole time,
 that rope just unspooling. I am trying not
 to look at the rope because I don't want to, like, lock up in panic and fear. But the whole time, I'm just
like, ""Am I moving fast enough? Can I move any faster?"" All right, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Yes! Bye! Oh, how close. (whoops) Oh, man, that was a thrill. It was so satisfying.
It was just, like... Like, advantage aside, I was
just like, ""I'm accomplished. I've done something today."" I'm shaking. Interesting. This does add to my options. Plus, I get to walk out
 of this situation with my vote, and that's huge. But I think that it also means
that I do need to be more vigilant about ensuring that people are still on
 the same page with me, because this can still paint a target
 on my back in way where they're like, ""Well, we were all
at a level playing field, ""but now Rachel has this power and she could use it to,
you know, make a big splash."" And so, with the things in my arsenal and the people on my side, I am genuinely having
that teetering moment of, like, ""Could this actually result
in me winning this game or could it be my demise?"" On any given day, anything can

Should we go welcome her? CAROLINE:
I think so. SAM:
Rachel! ALL:
Welcome back, Rachel! (whooping) Oh, my God. Hi, guys! I've never seen
anything like it. -What?
-What? RACHEL:
 Coming back from a journey and thinking about
what you want to tell everybody, it's sort of a lose-lose,
because not everyone's gonna believe you,
no matter what you say. But I think that what I'm trying
to do is err on the side of 99% honest, because there are three people
 that I don't want to know that I have
 an advantage, and I think keeping them in the dark
 about this is the best choice, in my opinion. I'm assuming
I'm going to, like, an island, and then, all of a sudden,
I see this, like, barge in the middle
of the ocean. -Yeah.
-And I walk up to this puzzle, but literally, to start it, I have to throw a weight
overboard, and it starts unspooling
all the things, and I was like, ""Come on!"" And it runs out, and the table flies off
the barge into the ocean. -TEENY: What?!
-SAM: So what happened? Did you lose a vote then
or what? Yeah, so I can't participate
at the next Tribal Council. ANDY:
Damn. Rachel comes back
and she tells us this story about being on a barge
in the middle of the ocean. And it's all very extravagant.
 But I'm thinking
 in the back of my mind, ""This is exactly
 what I would say if I had something
 and I got a big advantage."" So, I'm not buying it. I think Rachel's
got something up her sleeve. Hi. I got... I got a Block a Vote. It's only good till six. RACHEL:
 No, I won't, I swear. But I was thinking I could tell
 Andy and Teeny, because, as long as the five of us
are actually solid, we could use it if we need to. SUE: When Rachel told Caroline and myself
that she actually won the Block a Vote,
 I felt very bonded, because I feel like you don't share that
with people unless you truly trust them. -Can I tell you something?
-Yeah. Day one, Gabe walked up to me, and was like, ""Sue, I want you
to know I got you."" And he pulled out
the Beware Advantage. And that's why I wanted
to always protect him, because -I trusted him because
-Yeah. -he was upfront
and honest with me.
-Yeah. And that's where,
you know, like, you doing this
makes my heart happy and makes me 100%
trust everything -you say to-to...
-Yeah, yeah. I know. I knew I wanted to tell you. -Thank you.
-Yeah. Sue actually tells me
 about how Gabe, at the very beginning
 of the game, approached her and told her about his Beware Advantage and how that bonded him to her and how this was, like,
 a similar thing for her to me. And I genuinely believe that.
 I think Sue plays very emotionally,
and I think that that's great for my game
right now. Do you think that
the five is, like, legit? I know us three are. -I know us three are.
-RACHEL: Right. Yeah. I actually feel like all of our
interests are genuinely aligned. RACHEL:
That's why I agree. CAROLINE:
 So, Rachel has an advantage, and funny enough,
 I actually would prefer for her to have an advantage because I want Rachel
 to increase her threat level. Rachel doing well in this game just makes her
an even better ally for me, because someone
who becomes a threat now, they just become a shield later. -Yeah.
-Okay. -Yeah.
-Exactly. -Yes.
-Okay. Yeah. TEENY: Usually, the people who I put my trust in this game have gone ahead
and twisted the knife in my back and blindsided me
or not included me in plans, and I'm sick of that. I'm over it, and finding Andy and Rachel
 has been a solace, a sanctuary away
 from this distrustful betrayal that I had going with Genevieve. And so, I am feeling very good
about my group of three with Rachel, Andy and myself. Oh, it's a giant puka. -Ooh. Pretty.
-Crazy. They're everywhere. Yes. -If Kyle wins,
-Mm-hmm. would you be open
to considering one of the people who are, like, basically
being just, like, shepherded to final three, like, Sue and Andy? Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 So, the general consensus around camp is Sue and Andy are great to bring to the end with you. But from
 a strategic perspective, I would love to take out
 some of the people that are being brought
 to the end, because that frees up
more seats for us. RACHEL:
I am open to that. I'd have to think about,
like, who and... what. That would mean to,
like, get out... At this point in the game, Kyle is just
 this insane challenge beast that everyone's just
 itching to get out the second
 he doesn't win immunity. But Genevieve is so much
 more dangerous to me because Genevieve is actively
seeking people out, planting seeds in people's ears,
 planting distrust. And to me, that is a very important person to get out as soon as possible. Earlier, when I was
 picking up shells... (scoffs) -I want Genevieve.
-She's stirring the pot, -I want Genevieve.
-and I don't want... -Like, that stresses me out.
-That's not the first time she's said my name.
It's not the third time she's said my friggin' name. If I'm looking
 at the game board, the one piece that has just
become a big nuisance and a direct threat
 to my game is Genevieve. People throw my name out, -I want them out. Genevieve
-I know. has been doing that for days. So, she's gonna do it
with Caroline and Sue, too. She's gonna throw
all our names to that person. Yeah. You're right. So... ANDY:
 Genevieve telling Rachel that she's dragging me along
is laughable. I've been playing a game
 that no one is seeing, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being
 underestimated in this game. Genevieve is
 a snake in the grass. We need to get her out soon, and I'm confident I can make that happen. It 's t im e fo r th e ma in e ve nt : Wayfair's Black Friday

as I have my family, any calm and casual Tuesday, a plate of food in front of us
and just being together is what I want, and just to share that love
with one another. Sue, I got to check in. You seem emotional. I'm very proud of myself
for being here. And it's... I knew I was gonna
have tough times and I actually
was looking forward to it because I feel like
when I am knocked down, I do come back stronger. So, my desire is-is, like, so powerful inside me, and I believe in myself
that I can do it. ANDY:
I just want to say, like, I relate to Sue a lot
in this moment. I was standing
in this exact same spot. I recognize it. -You're talking about day three.
-Day three, exhaustion. I was feeling like
I gave it my everything and it wasn't enough. And that was gonna be my story. None of us have sailed through the first 20 days of this game. It's been rocky
for every single one of us. But this is what
I feel, altogether, that we have learned and grown this sense of backbone and composure
and resiliency that we could take
into the rest of our lives. Well, it's one of
the great things about Survivor. It is a roller coaster of highs
and lows, but there is one thing that is always there: opportunity.
Including right now. Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge? -(all voicing assent)
-All right, Kyle.
First things first. For the fourth time, I am taking it back from you. Thank you, sir. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're gonna use a rope to balance a wobbly table while you stack letter tiles. If at any point
 your stack drops, you got to start over. The first person
 to spell ""immunity""... ...wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final seven. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the eleventh person voted out, become the fourth member
of our jury. You are 20 days into your adventure
on Survivor 47. You want to guarantee
you see day 21? Win this. Big enough stakes? -(all voice assent)
-All right. We'll draw for your spots. We'll get it on.
Here we go. All right, here we go.
For immunity and a guaranteed spot
in the final seven. Survivors ready? Go! Ooh, everybody gonna
take time out of the gate to stack their blocks. Some people gonna race out, some people are stacking
their letters in order. You're racing out
with that first letter. You're spelling ""immunity""
from the bottom to the top, so you're spelling it backwards. You're balancing that table
to make sure it doesn't fall.
This is all about touch. How fast can I move while still keeping that rope really still? It's not so difficult
with the letter Y, but as that stack gets higher, it gets more precarious. Genevieve drops, got to
come back. That's gonna happen. That's how you start to find
where that tipping point is. You want to go
just as fast as you can, but not so fast
that you're out of control. Unless, of course,
you find yourself behind, in which case
you have to catch up. So, it's gonna be a lot
of changing strategies out here. Sam moving quickly
on his way back. Rachel moving quickly. Kyle and Teeny
moving very slowly, taking a different approach. Teeny's gonna go slow and steady and hope for
a late-game fail that will open the door for her. You got to focus on your game in Survivor and in this challenge, because you never know
when somebody's gonna drop. You just keep
building your stack. Sam places his seventh letter. -Okay.
-PROBST: Genevieve places
her seventh. Rachel places her seventh. Here comes Kyle with his sixth,
trying to get in on this. -...
-PROBST: Caroline drops. She's got to go back. It is now Sam in the lead, then Rachel, then Genevieve, all heading back for their
eighth and final block. This is it right here.
Three people in it. Everybody else chasing. Teeny places her sixth. Teeny hoping
for a disaster from all three, and that will open the door
for her. Oh... PROBST:
And she gets one of 'em.
Genevieve drops. Sam drops and loses everything! It is now Rachel
solely in the lead. Rachel drops
and loses everything! This is what Teeny and Kyle
were hoping for, and they got it. Kyle now in the lead,
along with Teeny. That is why you always
keep fighting on Survivor. That is why you never give up. 'Cause anything can
and often does happen. Now it's Kyle who has to worry -about it getting too perilous.
-No way. -Come on, Teeny.
-And Kyle drops everything. -Go, Teeny, go.
-PROBST: And just as though she had written it out,
Teeny got what she wanted. It is Teeny
with her seventh block. Kyle had done such a good job of catching up, but lost it. It is now Teeny and then Sue at five blocks,
and then Andy at four blocks. And now it's Teeny that has
to worry about the same thing. Just a little too much slack
in that rope, and it will dump. It wants to tip. It's top-heavy. And there it is--
the opportunity you want. Teeny drops everything. The lead is gone. And once again,
we have a fresh start. And now it is Sue in the lead. She has been slow and steady. Sue loses everything! We have another new leader. It is Andy. Andy loses everything! Oh, my God. We're back where we started. Damn. Right now, where we're at is Rachel's in the lead with seven. Kyle places his sixth block. Genevieve places her seventh. Genevieve and Rachel both
at seven letters, both with one letter left. Rachel has her eighth letter. She's heading back out. Genevieve still has
to get her eighth letter. Kyle one full letter behind. Everybody else not in it
right now. Damn. Rachel slowly but surely
inching closer. Genevieve slowly but surely inching closer to Rachel. We could have a race
to the finish here. Rachel very close to placing that eighth and final block. Genevieve right on her tail. Genevieve loses everything. And that is a huge opportunity
for Rachel. She can slow down now. Kyle the only person
chasing her. Kyle now placing
his seventh letter. This'll put him
one behind Rachel. Rachel has spelled ""immunity."" All she has to do now
is get back to the end and get two feet
on the platform, that necklace is hers,
day 21 is guaranteed. Can she do it? Kyle has a big decision. Does he go for it? Do you push it,
put your foot on the gas, or do you hope Rachel drops? One wrong move, and this game
is back up in the air. Rachel slowing down now. It is a game of cat and mouse. Kyle on the platform now, reaching for his eighth
and final block. This is where
things get really tricky. One wrong move,
and you will dump everything. Rachel now down
to about six steps left. Kyle has made up some time, and he's coming back
with his eighth letter. It would be a huge comeback for Kyle to place this letter
and catch Rachel. This is coming down
to Rachel's last few steps. Can she hold it steady, get two feet on that platform and win immunity? Kyle moving quickly
on his way back. He's gonna go for broke and try to pull it out. Can he catch Rachel
or is this over unless Rachel drops? Rachel two steps away
from immunity. All eyes on Rachel. She's got one foot
on the platform. Kyle's hoping for a mistake. -It's over. Rachel wins
-SUE: Yay, Rachel! individual immunity! TEENY:
Rachel! PROBST:
Guaranteed a spot -in the final seven.
-Rachel! -(laughing)
-PROBST: Tribal Council tonight. -Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Somebody will be
the eleventh person voted out and become
the fourth member of our jury. It will not be Rachel. Wow! What a challenge. RACHEL:
Oh, don't believe that. -Rachel, come on over.
-Go, Rachel!
-Yeah! -Congratulations.
-Thank you. Immunity is yours,
safe tonight at Tribal Council, cannot be voted out
of this game. You will live to see day 21. What did it take
to win this challenge? RACHEL:
You know what's so funny?
My husband Derek is the opposite of me.
He is so patient. I'm the most impatient person. And so, like, I was just... In that moment, I was like,
""Just harness him. ""Like, he would be screaming
at you to slow down, to just focus and just,
like, take my time,"" which is something
I'm not very good at. (laughs) It worked today.
You are safe, not going home. As for the rest of you,
after 20 days, somebody's Survivor dream
will come to an end, eleventh person voted out,
fourth member of our jury. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. Congrats. -Thanks.
-SUE: Good job. Rachel. PROBST:
Grab your stuff, head out. TEENY:
 It is beyond overdue for us to take Kyle out. Getting Kyle out will be a way to help all of our odds
in this game. 'Cause I don't think there's any
 beating Kyle in this game. He's too good of a competitor, he's got too good a story,
 and people just like Kyle. So, the best thing
 for this entire group to do is to vote Kyle out. Bi g ne ws f or M ah om es ! I'm switching to iPhone 16

 to camp with immunity is this incredible feeling. That's something
that I wasn't sure that I would ever get
to do in this game. -Good job, Rachel.
-Good job, Rachel.
-Rachel! RACHEL:
Everyone's clapping and saying,
 ""Good job,"" and, like, whether they mean it or not,
it feels good. (laughs) Where do you hang it?
I don't even know. Here? Yeah, just hang it up there. RACHEL:
 Kyle has had this necklace around his neck for so long that we have not been able
 to take any shots at him. And so, it's an ""easy vote""
to vote Kyle out tonight. On the other hand,
when it's a really obvious vote, that's a perfect time
 to take out somebody that's unsuspecting, like Genevieve or Sam. And frankly, I want all three
 of them out of this game. I don't really care
what order they go in. And so, it does feel like
by winning the necklace, I have way more options for who's gonna
 go home tonight. SUE:
 I've been waiting patiently, and there will be nothing
that will bring me more pleasure than writing Kyle's name down
 tonight at Tribal Council. I knew his day would come, and I've been drooling. (laughs) Drooling... for this day. I think it would be a little bit
dumb to do anything else. Everybody will have
a better chance at immunity, everyone will have
a better chance at winning. Do you guys agree? -Yes.
-I agree. GENEVIEVE:
 If I had my way, Kyle would stay. Unfortunately, I have zero power right now. The group is gonna do
 what they want, which I'm told is Kyle. But my name was out there for the Gabe vote
 and, thankfully, I was able to, like,
by the skin of my teeth, hide behind Gabe. And so, tonight, I hope that everyone is more afraid
of Kyle than me. SAM: It is not good for my game to get Kyle out of here. As soon as Kyle is gone, everybody that's looking
at Kyle is looking at Sam, and it's way too early to have
everybody looking at Sam. We can do Sue,
we can do anybody. -Or Andy.
-I'm not doing it. Okay. The problem tonight is getting one
of the other five players in the tribe on board to save Kyle, and I don't know
if the numbers are there. TEENY:
I'm not doing that,
and I would really appreciate if you guys didn't do that. SAM:
We can't do it
without you, so... So, I might have
 to just go with the group once again, and that sucks,
 but that's the game. ANDY:
 I'll keep it short. You don't have an idol, do you? -No.
-Okay. I don't think
you have the numbers. Especially if Rachel has a vote. I don't know about that or not. KYLE: Not bringing home
 that necklace really means that I've got a lot
 of work to do. I've been so vulnerable
with my story and the reason why I'm here. They know it's an excellent
 story, and that a family man is a dangerous person
 to have in the endgame, so, now it's time to step away from my physical abilities
and just try to get
 into the social game of this and try to get somebody
 on a different direction, other than headed at me,
at this point. If the votes are
that unanimous against me, would you take a risk and shoot
one direction to try to help me? I promised you, right, that... I would want Gabe first
and then Genevieve next, and I meant it. Everyone's eyes are set on Kyle, but I'm thinking that if I want to leave my imprint on this game
and start making my mark and start flipping
the win switch, I have kind of maybe
other ideas. If I had it my way,
 I would 100% prefer for Genevieve to be the one
 to leave tonight. And so, I have to
 pitch a case in which I can make that happen. -Yeah.
-So... The likelihood
he's gonna win all of the next four immunities
is 6.25% chance. It's not that risky.
It's a calculated risk. I like thinking about things
 in terms of probability. That gives him a coin flip
 to win a given challenge. Roughly, for a coin flip to land on heads four times in a row is, um, one out of... two, four, and... Wait. Two, four... It's one out of 16, and that is a 6.25% chance
 of happening. That's not that risky. The risk of winning out
is too high. Even if he doesn't win... People will see it as too high,
I would see it as too high. ""The chances of him winning another immunity challenge
are 6.2%."" No, that's not 6.2%. I don't know where
you got that number from, but it is... baloney. TEENY: Yeah. The only thing Kyle's gonna do
from here on out, he's gonna sit in the shelter,
make the fire, talk about Shania. That's-that's who he is
as a game player. She's threw my name out,
your name out, your name out. I look at that
as more threatening to our five-person alliance
than Kyle. TEENY: Andy and Rachel are definitely heavily weighing
taking out Genevieve tonight. I think they are starting
to feel the fear of Genevieve. ""She's just going to find a way ""to win a challenge and stay
 in this game long enough to take the rest of us out."" It's a valid concern. I'm not not hearing it. I know that
we have to get him first. His run is overrated.
That's all I'm saying. CAROLINE:
 Getting rid of Genevieve
 honestly makes sense, but targeting Genevieve
 means targeting Sue and betraying her trust and potentially
 destroying our alliance. So, I'm really hoping,
with every fiber of my being, he agrees with me and we can stick to the smart plan. RACHEL:
 I think that Genevieve is way scarier of a player
than Kyle is. So, if everyone
 is staring at Kyle and assuming he's going home, this would be a perfect time to
get a player out like Genevieve. TEENY:
 Kyle has won
 four immunities, so to not take him out when he doesn't
have a necklace on would just be the dumbest look ever
for us as players in this game. ANDY:
 A lot of people go
 by their gut or their heart. Those things are really not in my decision-making right now.
Like, I'm playing the numbers,
 but the hard part is getting everyone else on board
 and trying to convince them that my plan should be the plan
 to happen tonight. Hi , I' m Gr eg . I live in Bloomington, Illinois. I'm not an actor. I'm just a regular person. After working 25 years in the

of our jury. PROBST:
All right,
so with tonight's vote, eleventh person voted out becomes the fourth member
of the jury. So, Sam, as this power starts
to shift more to the jury, what changes about the vote? SAM:
I think everybody
goes into a vote figuring out who is a threat
to them later on. But, you know, I actually think
this group might have a bit of a warped perception
of that because I think there's people
in this game that go through the motions of, ""Here's the people
that can beat me, so I got
to take all of them out,"" but not consider the fact that if they just go down the line,
they're not gonna get there. And all of a sudden, those votes mean nothing to them
'cause they'll be one of them. PROBST:
Rachel, do you agree
with that philosophy? Yeah, I mean, I think it's clear that power players are being
taken out of this game, but I think that Sam's
perspective is Sam's perspective because he may be somebody that is more powerful
than other people sitting here. And so, whoever
Sam thinks is a threat and whoever Sam thinks
he can beat is different than who I think is a threat
and who I think I can beat. It's different
for every single person here, and that's what
makes it complicated. Kyle, what do you think
about that? KYLE:
The way that I'm seeing things is a little bit different,
maybe, than the way that other people are
seeing things right now, because I'm sitting in a hot seat. They want to vote me out,
mostly because of like, ""Wow. this guy
is physically challenging."" Yes, I've prevailed
in challenges, but ultimately, the social game, the strategy game,
all the other parts of this game that come into play, I might not
have executed so good. We've had people on Survivor that have just
annihilated challenges, got to the end
and not received votes. I might not be as big of
a threat as what people think. PROBST:
Andy, Kyle makes a valid point. Half of the people that have won five individual immunity
challenges did not win Survivor. They might not have even
got to the end. Yeah. I do kind of
understand what Kyle's saying, to an extent.
Like, I didn't do much sugarcoating.
Like, I lied to all three
of those jurors -on their way out,
to their faces, so,
-He did. it just goes to show how there
are so many different sides to Survivor and what
makes a good player. Whether that's pitching that
you are beatable at the end, that you can't win at the end, that you're
a one-dimensional player-- that all goes into it.
And you just have to weigh, like, how to survive.
And you just have to give yourself the best chance
to win the game at the end. PROBST:
Teeny, was there
a big debate about ""threats"" in terms of what kind of threat
is most dangerous right now? TEENY:
Absolutely. If you are more
of an outward-facing threat, somebody like-- sorry-- Kyle, who's won
four different competitions, like, that's a big
physical challenge threat. Or if you're somebody who's leading and orchestrating
a lot of votes, you're getting your voice heard. That's a big outward threat. We all sort of know who falls into the big,
outward-threat section, and who falls
into this sort of underdog, maybe sneaky,
come-from-behind threat. And that's where
decisions like this are super important. Genevieve, are you displeased
or just thinking? (laughs) Both. Both. So, Teeny mentioned
outward threats-- ""are you great
at immunity challenges?"" She's not talking about me. But then she said,
""Or you get your voice heard or you lead votes,"" and I've heard my name a lot. The pitch I try and make is
if there are people who everyone
is comfortable keeping in, they're probably taking up seats
you want in the end. So, it's difficult
to make a pitch. I mean, once you get that stamp
of threat, it doesn't wash off. So, Andy, you go back to camp, you start talking. There's one thing
very different. There were no Shot in the Darks. So, unless someone has an idol or some other kind
of new advantage, there's nothing they can do. Did you sense that today? The safety net is off
for sure, but we're still kind of playing
the way we're playing, and we're not just gonna walk up to a target and say,
""You're the target."" We're trying
to be more sophisticated with that, and layered. We're not playing a simple vote. We're not just doing
load up on one person and not worry
about the consequences. -PROBST:
Kyle, you're smiling big.
-(laughs) -You don't buy that answer.
-KYLE: Well, it's not
that I don't buy that answer, but, like, there's a couple of points
that I'd like to highlight on. When we got back to camp,
it was pretty obvious that I didn't have a necklace
around my neck at this point in time. There was no safety
for me, right? So I pulled a couple
of individuals. And one of those individuals
told me that ""There are so many people
gunning for you right now,"" which tells me that
people are still hiding behind one another
and making an obvious play. But this is opportunities
for moves to be made. This is, like,
time to flip the switch. This is when you start
to think about maybe there's different threats. PROBST:
So, did anything change to give you some optimism,
or as you sit here right now, do you believe you're the vote? You know, I'm gonna be optimistic
in this position. I'm not going to roll over
and just give up. That's not who I am, and that's not
who I want to be perceived as. So, we have the opportunity
to have a crowd-pleasing moment, something that we can shift
to the point where, like, you know, somebody
didn't see that coming. PROBST:
Sue, that's an
interesting comment. ""We could have
a crowd-pleasing moment if we don't take me out."" Right, well, personally, I feel
every single person here is making up their own mind. They're not really
being swayed by anybody. I certainly am not
having anybody try to sway my vote.
I know what I'm planning on doing
and I'm sticking to it. Sam, what did you experience
this afternoon? SAM:
Uh, I think my experience was pretty similar to everybody
else's in the sense that Kyle is the obvious target. But he also makes
some very good points. The fact that he is a vote,
the fact that he is a shield to a lot of people who feel like they're also targets, and they're also threats
in this game. -PROBST: How about you, Rachel?
-RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, I think it's being
underplayed a little bit. I definitely
had discussions today about targets that were not Kyle that were seriously considered.
So, I don't think that it was just, Kyle doesn't win immunity,
and we're voting out Kyle. There...
It is more nuanced than that, whether people want
to believe that or not. Genevieve,
when you hear Kyle say, ""Well, I was told it was me,""
does that give you comfort? Uh, I don't think it'll be... a dogpile on Kyle tonight. PROBST:
Genevieve, you're
very quiet tonight. Your energy is quieter,
your voice is quieter. Is that 20 days of exhaustion or is that the pressure
of being at Tribal feeling that your name might
actually be the name tonight? I'm a little bit... all over the place, mentally. Um, half of my mind is, ""I wonder if
I'll get through tonight."" And the other half is... ""Then how do I
get through tomorrow?"" CAROLINE:
Funny enough, this is actually a moment where
I would remind Genevieve of one of my absolute
favorite Tribal quotes I've heard so far, which is, ""The great Survivor players can see through the noise
to see the news."" -Who said that?
-Genevieve. CAROLINE:
And I have honestly thought
about that quote -almost every day.
-PROBST: Genevieve, so you have a player
telling you, ""You actually said something
that I'm using right now. You should use it
yourself tonight."" That's community, Jeff. And it's so twisted out here,
and it can feel awful and it can feel, like, rejuvenating and like,
""Oh, yeah. Maybe I'm not on an island
all on my own."" So, thank you, Caroline. Absolutely.
I mean it. PROBST:
Genevieve, there's one more layer
that starts to creep into this
at 20 days and only eight people left
is that you know each other. It starts to become personal. GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, since the Kishan vote, I have made
a very specific effort to separate Genevieve the person from Genevieve the player, which is how I am able
to think strategically without clouded vision. But people I've known
for a long time trickled through and pulled in some emotion from Genevieve the person.
People I've known only for a short time
were able to access that, and it does make it more complex for me.
I wish I could truly just
be Genevieve the player. It would be a lot easier. Andy, more difficult for you the
longer you stay in this game? ANDY:
I do think it gets more intense, but at the same time,
the finish line is right there. Right?
We see eight slots and five people have to go. I feel like
there's a happy medium where you have to determine the big calculus of thinking about
everyone's threat levels, because it is dynamic,
and it's gonna change after this vote.
It's gonna change after the next vote.
And the real goal is to be not at the top, not at
the bottom. You have to just figure out a way to get through and have a shot
to win at the end. PROBST:
Kyle, do you agree with that? KYLE:
I think there's a lot of truth
to that, but it's getting to the point
where you may not want to just go
majority rules anymore. I think this is time
where you can really start flipping the script,
making moves happen that people really
weren't expecting, and prove to the people
that are sitting over there that you have in the tank
what it takes to make things happen. Okay, it is time to vote. Genevieve, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right.
I'll read the votes. First vote: Genevieve. Kyle. One vote Kyle,

 after trying a TNF blocker like HUMIRA
 or ENBREL, RINVOQ works differently. RINVOQ is a
 once-daily pill that can rapidly
 relieve joint pain, stiffness, and swelling as fast as
 2 weeks for some. And even at the 3-year mark, many people felt this relief. RINVOQ can stop joint damage. And in PsA, can leave skin
 clear or almost clear. RINVOQ can lower ability
 to fight infections. Before treatment,
 test for TB and do bloodwork. Serious infections,
 blood clots, some fatal; ...cancers, including lymphoma
 and skin; serious allergic reactions; GI tears; death; heart attack;
 and stroke occurred. CV event risk increases in age
 50 plus with a heart disease
 risk factor. Tell your doctor if you've had
 these events, infection, hep B or C, smoked, are pregnant or planning. Don't take if allergic
 or have an infection. Done settling? Ask your rheumatologist
 for RINVOQ. And take back what's yours. (♪♪) CAROLINE: We are gonna

 Previously on Survivor... VENUS:
 All of a sudden,
 I have a rock-solid alliance. I'm feel pumped. KENZIE:
 I woke up this morning
 with an idea that we could make a fake idol and make Jess think
 she has a real idol. I'm trying to help. I have Jess on one side. I have Kenzie on the other side. So I know one of the two that I want to go home will exit tonight. Bhanu, you appear
to be very forthcoming about who you're tight with.
So, how about Jess? Playing this for yourself? Yeah.
Going to play it for myself. -For yourself? Okay.
-Yeah. This is... not a hidden immunity idol. (both laughing) Second person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jess. Oh, man. The tribe has spoken. -Q: That was a fun Tribal.
 -TIFFANY: Yeah. -KENZIE: It was lively.
-TIFFANY: It sure was. BHANU:
I felt so naive. -I really did.
-TIFFANY: Why? BHANU:
Where did she get the idol from? We just snipped it off
of D.J.'s water bottle. When we got back to camp, I feel like we had a little bit
of explaining to do. Bhanu didn't know anything
 about the fake idol, and we had to frame it so that, like,
it was all in his best interest. We didn't want to tell you
until we got back to camp because we didn't want you
to accidentally blurt it out. Q:
You got to think about it now. Let's say if that idol was real. She wrote your name down, so... She wrote my name down? -Yes.
-Q: Yeah. BHANU: She said that everyone's
writing my name down? Q:
No, she wrote your name down. KENZIE:
We all voted Jess. -We all voted for Jess.
-Q: We all voted Jess. And she voted for you. That's why
we gave her that fake idol. KENZIE:
So that she wouldn't play
her Shot in the Dark. Q:
So she wouldn't play
that Shot in the Dark. BHANU:
 I'm so glad that
 I'm still on the island. So... namaste to that. (laughs) But I could be the next person
 going home because Kenzie, Q and Tiffany
 are pulling all their master tricks. They played it in such a way that Jess plays
 the fake hidden humidity idol rather than
 the Shot in the Dark. And she writes a name,
and guess whose name she wrote. Jess said that I'm her best
friend, and she wrote my name. (laughs) Survivor it is. Q:
That's why
it's so critical at Tribal. We got to watch what we say
and when we say things. Mm-hmm. Q:
Tribal is not over until Jeff... KENZIE:
Reads the votes
and snuffs somebody's torch. Q:
Reads the vote
and snuff the torch. So just because
we're at Tribal don't mean now is the time
to air it out, you know? TIFFANY:
You can totally lie to Jeff. -It's okay.
-(Bhanu sighs)
-KENZIE: Or just, like, -not saying anything at all.
-TIFFANY: Or just... I was about to say,
""Or just keep quiet."" -KENZIE: If you don't
want to lie,
-You can't lie, -just don't say nothing.
-don't say anything. BHANU:
 They're saying like,
 ""Oh, you don't have to, ""like, give honest answers
 to Jeff Probst. You can just give him
 any kind of crap."" But I can't do that. They said that you should know when to-- what is it-- when to show, when to shot? Something like that.
I don't know what that proverb. Something... you know... Fold? Ah. You have to know when to... when to fold, when to hold. I'm not an actor. I can't do that. (sniffles)
Yeah. So that's where I'm at. (laughs) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (birdsong) KENZIE:
 We are probably going down
 in Survivor history as, like, one of the
roughest starts in the new era. We haven't won anything. We still don't have a fire. We're getting rained on,
the shelter has holes in it. We found
 this rock wall overhang. Here's a ton of dirt,
and we slept here. Like, that's where Yanu is at. I'm gonna walk back to camp
and get my water... -Are you okay?
-Yeah. -What's going on?
-Okay. -I didn't sleep, that's all.
-Yeah? Yeah. It was raining all night. I didn't sleep a wink. And I'm paranoid
because those three-- all three of them
 are in a tight alliance, and if we don't win the next immunity challenge,
 I'll be going home. They have so many tricks
 in their hats to pull. They're very good at this. All three are masterminds. One mind versus three. The only way to save myself is to find a hidden immunity
 idol so I can move forward. It's not here. Where can I find this idol? It can be under many
of these coconuts. I've been looking for the idol
 pretty much the whole time I've been on this island. So many coconuts. And I don't have any luck. I have to turn
all these coconuts upside down. I don't know. This is so frustrating. I want to play the game, and... I'm hitting a wall all the time. (groans) BHANU:
Can I have
a heart-to-heart with you? KENZIE:
What's wrong? I want to stay in this game, but it seems like, you know, my name is
on the chopping block next. And that's why I'm asking, like, if there is any way
that I can work with you. I mean, I'm open
to hearing plans, for sure. I-I don't have any, and I'm not
throwing any names out there. I'm just asking, like... Do you see how
that's kind of hard for me to work with, though? Bhanu is not playing, is what Banu is doing wrong. He doesn't have a strategic bone
in his sweet little body. I feel so alone. I don't know what to do.
(sniffles) I need some help, Kenzie. KENZIE:
 He loves the game,
 he loves to watch it, but it's different to play it. I think he just came out here
with a good attitude, which is appreciated,
definitely, but it's not a long-term thing
that's gonna get you far, especially now, in the new era. Like, we only have 26 days. People are dropping like flies
and right now, it's us. Loyalty is very important
in regular life and Survivor, but you also have to
come up with some plan for people to be able
to work with. BHANU:
 Always sweet Kenzie--
 how she portrays herself-- she's like this mermaid... dragon. Mermaid up until here, but she's hiding
 under the rocks. She's like a very beautiful,
 sweet, kind mermaid. But when
you look behind the rock, it's a big dragon tail. That's Kenzie. I said, like,
 ""Hey, can I work with you?"" And she's like,
 ""Yeah, I can work with you, ""but you have
 to tell me the plan. ""So if you have a plan,
 then let me know and then we can work on it."" Mermaid... dragon. Remember that. I don't know where
my-my position is in the tribe. Here's the deal. I want
to keep you around because I know for a fact that you're a loyal person
and a loyal vote. I would rather have somebody
that's loyal that I can coach you up
to say, at Tribal Council, ""This is what you say."" You've looked at past seasons, look at Boston Rob's season. He had a Phillip.
You're my Phillip. I know you're gonna
be a loyal soldier. You're gonna be there.
You're not gonna flip-flop. You can listen to information, but you're not gonna flip on me. That's what I want to take, bub. I knew Bhanu
 was having a hard time, but what I don't want him
to do is get so wrapped up in his mind
that we're against him and he gives up. So I had to reassure Bhanu
 that we're in this together, and if push comes to shove, we just have to make sure
that we're on the same page. It is going to be
an uphill battle to get our foot
back into this game. But if you can
connect with folks like how you were
at camp with us, you have a great shot
at winning. -You see what I'm saying?
-But I cannot win. -Anybody can win.
-I'm a wackadoodle -and, like...
-Wackadoodles win. Get the confidence within. You can win,
just like I can win. So, cheer up. We're good. -Thank you, Coach.
-Yes, sir. BHANU:
That's a really,
really good talk. However, what if the girls
came up with that idea? Because even last night, the girls came up with
 the fake immunity idol thing. So what they're trying
to do is... I don't have to play my Shot in the Dark so they can...
they can vote me off. That's what they wanted to do. Or maybe Q is really... He like... he likes me. I don't know. How will I know? That's how smart

 We're going on a field trip. Going to find some idols. CHARLIE:
Oh, idol, where are you? Where do you live? MORIAH:
 This morning, we all agree to go on an idol hunt together. Aah! The thing
 with a group idol hunt is you're half hunting for idols and you're half hunting
for pocket clumps. You got one eye on the ground and you got one eye on
the person next to you looking. -Did you find it?
-No.
-No. Off the beaten path, eh? I got stuck
in a tree once as a kid. BEN:
No bueno, dude. (laughs) I was like,
""It's not. It's a leaf."" Big old nothing.
Big old goose egg out here. Charlie, did we
go that way already? I really think, like,
this tree looks promising. CHARLIE:
 The group idol hunts--
 they feel a little fake. I guarantee you, if anyone out here
could find an idol or advantage on their own and in secret, they're gonna keep it
to themselves. JEM:
Keep looking. We'll find it. CHARLIE:
 I want that to be Charlie's idol.
I want that to be mine. JEM:
This is such a unique tree. I feel like
it has to be one in here. CHARLIE:
 If I find something,
 I don't want anyone to hear me screech
 or see the sparkle in my eye when I know
that I have that extra little safety
 in that little, little pouch. JEM:
 I spot the Beware Advantage. I grabbed it and I immediately
 stuck it in my pants. And Charlie's right next to me, so I had to tell myself like,
""Calm down."" My heart was like this 'cause
I was so scared in that moment. Come on, little idol. JEM:
 I think I pulled it off 'cause everybody was still
 idol hunting like crazy. In the back of my mind, I was like, ""What did I just, like, literally
shove down my pants?"" I was like, ""I want to read it.
 I want to read it so bad."" Oh, my God. I hope that
it's a simple process. I want to go, like,
 dig it up and find out, but I don't want
 anybody to know. I'll go tonight. I don't care
if it's dark and I can't see. At least I know
where I have to go. Finally, it gets pitch dark. We're laying around, and I look
 to see if everybody is asleep. (snoring) I heard Tim start snoring. So, this is the perfect
 golden opportunity to slip away silently. (snoring) My heart's beating, like,
 really superfast because I don't want
 to get caught 'cause that's gonna paint,
 like, a target on my back. But to play this game, you have to be tough
 and you have to take every advantage that you have in order to, like,
 propel you further. So I start digging.
 I can't see anything. Like, literally,
 it's so pitch black. And then, I move some more.
 Like, I dig really deep. And then, I feel a box. My heart just dropped.
 It's a freaking lockbox. And then,
I saw a scroll attached to it. Then it says... ""The location of the key
will remain a mystery until after your tribe loses
a future immunity challenge."" ""Until you have taken possession
of the idol, you cannot vote
at Tribal Council."" Oh, my God. What the hell did you
get yourself into, Jem? I just want that idol so bad, like, now more than ever 'cause
I need it to restore my vote. (chopping) What is this man doing now? LIZ:

he can do. SODA:
Where does
he get this stuff from? Must just run in the family, like, the outdoor lifestyle.
You know? He actually doesn't need to talk
 that much strategy right now because he has strength
and we want to keep winning. So, no one wants
 to get rid of him. -(creak)
-SODA: Oh, it made a bed sound. (laughing):
It made a bed sound. LIZ:
 I feel like he's here because he just loves the adventure
of it all. HUNTER:
 I love that people think I'm just here to help the tribe. I'm a very intelligent
individual and I don't want people
to know that. I want to keep that inside. When I was growing up,
 I was always good at school. I graduated college early. I had direct admissions
into medical school. I had a full-ride scholarship. But as I was getting set up
 to go to medical school, I got the opportunity
 to substitute teach for my sister in my hometown. I had just seen Survivor. I fell in love with it. And I said, ""I want to build
 a challenge for the kids ""before I go off
 to medical school. It'll be my last big thing
 to plan before I go."" But being in the classroom and being with the kids day in
 and day out and having kids come to me and say,
 ""I really enjoyed that."" I was like,
 ""Wow. This just feels right."" And so I changed from the full-ride scholarship
to medical school. My parents lost their minds,
but I came back and I chose to teach. I also don't think I want
 to advertise that, ""Hey, I build challenges
in my backyard."" This is what
my house looks like. It's full of puzzles
and stuff left over from previous challenges
that I've done. The drop-down puzzles,
tiles for building towers, more puzzles,
replicas of puzzles, more pieces of puzzles, sandbags thrown,
more stacks of puzzles, more puzzles. So, yes, I am a superfan, but it seems like
a silly thing to share. Uh, it-it's like-it's like
painting a target on my back. Oh, Hunter. Wow. Make me a Tempur-Pedic. VENUS:
 Hunter is just... We see him every season. You know, there's always
that one big buff guy. ""I'm the provider.
 You can't vote me out."" And as a person, I think Hunter's, like,
a really sweet dude. But also, I can see
right through that facade. Tevin and Hunter
are running this game and if you don't
see that, then... Hunter is running this game? -You don't think so?
-No. -Do you?
-I-I can't see your perspective unless you provide
your perspective. I'm asking you
for your, you know? Uh, my perspective is
I'm not blind. If you just look around,
who has the greatest link with as many people? Hunter has Tevin on lock.
 He has that connection. I want Hunter out

a second bag for Nami. Hunter with another...
Nice touch. On and off. Hunter has got this figured out.
That is three in a row. -JEM: Charlie, you got this!
-PROBST: Q feeling the pressure. Charlie feeling the pressure. SODA:
You got it, baby. PROBST:
Nami was in dead last, and they are now decidedly
in the lead. And there is number four
for Nami. Still nothing
for the other two tribes. -Oh, I got it!
-PROBST: Tiff lands
the first one for Yanu. Hunter for the win. -(cheering)
-There it is!
Nami wins immunity, once again safe from the vote. An amazing performance
by Hunter. We are looking for one more. It is now Siga and Yanu. Yanu in the lead with one. Q coming back in,
trying to land number two. Q, slice it! Charlie has the first one
for Siga. We are tied, one-one. Five bags total. Somebody gets hot,
this could be over quickly. Yes! PROBST: Could it be Charlie?
He lands a second for Siga. It is now Siga in the lead
and Yanu trailing. -Yes! Yes!
-Yes. Q sticks the second for Yanu. We're tied again, two-two. Charlie trying
to land the third. And he does. Siga back
in the lead with three. Q. -Oh, Q knocks one off.
-Oh, no! Now it's Tiff back in, trying
to make up something for Yanu. -KENZIE: Yes, yes, yes, yes!
-PROBST: And Tiff gets hot. -Tiff lands a second.
-You got this, Charlie! -(whooping)
-PROBST: Charlie has the fourth
for Siga. Can he close it out? Just misses. Tiff lands a third. Who's gonna pull it out? It's Charlie and Tiff right now. Charlie just misses. Tiff just misses. Q back in now for Yanu.
Siga down to their last bag. Q trying to tie it up.
Charlie trying to win it. Q lands the fourth for Yanu. We are tied again. Charlie and Q trying
to be the hero for their tribe. -BEN: There it is, Charlie.
-PROBST: You win it for your tribe or you lose it for your tribe. (overlapping chatter) Right there. -Charlie does it for Siga!
-(cheering) Siga pulls it out, sending Yanu back to Tribal Council -for the third straight time
-Aah! this season. And it's all there
on the faces of Yanu-- absolute despair
at another loss. We were so close. Q. KENZIE:
You gave it your all. You were so close. Nami, congratulations. -The winning streak continues.
-(cheering) Ow, ow! Nobody going home from Nami. Siga, once again,
immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Siga. Before I send you out of here, we have a journey scheduled
for you today. Nami, you're in charge
of who goes. You're gonna choose
one person from your tribe, one person from Siga
and one person from Yanu. So, first tell me
who's going from your tribe. -Liz.
-Liz is going.
-PROBST: All right. So Liz is going.
All right. Who from Siga's gonna go on this journey? I'm gonna go with Ben. -Who's gonna go from Yanu?
-Bhanu. PROBST:
All right, Liz, Ben and Bhanu, grab your stuff, head out.
Boat's waiting for you. You will return back
to your camp before Tribal. -Be safe.
-Love you. Have fun. PROBST:
All right, Siga, Nami, no Tribal Council,
nobody going home. Your reward will be waiting
for you back at camp. Grab your stuff, head out.
Enjoy the night off. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you, Jeff. All right, Yanu, nothing to say. Seven days already
without flint. I'm keeping it. Sorry for you. You'll have another chance to win it back
at your next immunity challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at Tribal. -See you later, Jeff.
-PROBST: See you later. TIFFANY: Bhanu is absolutely,
 100%, unequivocally the worst person that could
have gone on that journey. Bhanu can't keep his mouth shut. I'm just wondering
 what information he's giving up
 to this other tribe. And I really hope Bhanu doesn't
 get some type of advantage because that's gonna make that
 ten times harder for us to get him out. Survivor is still going strong

the bad karma to this situation? Shocking turn of events, Survivor fans. Yanu got their ass beat again. (laughs) We lost again. How? I don't know. Everything was going so right
and it still went wrong. But at this point,
 losing feels expected for us. Also, out of
all the friggin' people that get picked
to go on the journey, the one who we want to vote out. And I guarantee you his ass
is up there giving it up. ""Yeah, me and Tiff are in line. ""And me and Q is number one. -Me and Kenzie...""
-""And they all played
a fake idol against Jess."" -He's spilling our whole game.
-I know. I know he is up there
giving it up, bro. KENZIE:
 Bhanu getting picked
 to go on the journey was just another typical Yanu bad luck situation. The one thing
we don't want to happen happens. It's almost like this is some weird Survivor karmic curse that we have. I don't know what's going on. What is wrong with us? That's on me. -I-I'm telling y'all.
-BOTH: No, it's not. -Stop.
-No, it's not on you. -No, it's not.
-Q: Listen, we're... I was put in the spotlight to deliver for my tribe, and I let 'em down big time. I choked at the end
 and I didn't get it done. Now my tribe has
to go back to Tribal Council and, you know, I feel horrible. Horrible. As a former Division I athlete, I'm built for moments like this. I'm very, very tough on myself because I understand
 that I can do better. Time to be clutch. You weren't clutch, bro. You weren't clutch at all, bro. One bag. Bro, you couldn't sink one bag. You screwed up. Why should they go home?
Why should you stay? It takes me back to a time when I was in high school. I was the star player or
supposed to be the star player, and I fumbled -with a minute left in the game.
 -(crowd groaning) -(whistle blows)
 -And the other team
 picks it up and win. That following Monday,
 it was huge in the newspaper. ""Burdette fumbles."" That's a bad feeling. And that is how
 I'm feeling right now. In this game,
 this was my lowest moment. So now I feel like it's up to me to make up for it. I fumbled today, you know? And it don't feel good,
you know? -It's-it's tough on me.
-But it's a bizarre thing. -Q: I know. It was.
-Like, no one has ever...
You couldn't practice that. -But it's not about practice.
-Yeah. It's about execution. He didn't practice, either. And when the time got down, and it was crunch, he clocked in and I didn't deliver. And for me, that's
not-that's not acceptable. So, tonight at Tribal, I'd rather it be me
than, like, somebody like Bhanu. (scoffs) Q, surprisingly, became a martyr and was like, ""Vote me out."" And I can't get a read on it. It's not his personality,
but it is. It's very confusing. That's what's so crazy
about this game. Like... You don't know what to believe.
You don't know who to trust. It's so bonkers. Q:
I'm serious about this, though. You go on in the game.
Seriously. I'm-I'm being deadass.
I'm deadass. Especially after
today's performance, you know? Oh, give me a break
with the ... self-deprecation. You know damn well
I'm not voting you. Q doesn't handle
 these losses well. I think it's because, like,
 he has this invisible pressure that he's putting on himself, because everybody's looking-- well, I'm not looking to him
for guidance-- but other people are
looking to him for guidance. Like, ""Oh, yeah, Coach.
Tell us the game plan,"" which I think
is stupid and silly, anyway. Why does my road
always have to be the hardest? TIFFANY:
 Why are y'all letting somebody
 coach you through this game that you're supposed
 to be playing for yourself? I think that's dumb.
 I already have a plan. My plan is to vote Bhanu. And fingers crossed that
 he doesn't come back to camp with an idol in his pocket. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thank you. I'm so excited. I'm going on the journey
 with Bhanu and Ben. Hi, friends. What's up, crew? My goal is just to see what is really going on at Yanu.
(chuckles) I'm so curious. Hey, Bhanu,
if I may just say something before we start chilling. I see you putting in the heart. -Yes.
-I see you giving your all. Great players have come back
from far worse, and I don't want you to think that's indicative
of the game you're playing, the situation you're in.
And who knows? We might be able to turn
that around for you right now. -But I'm stoked to be here

-Yeah. I was just thinking,
it's day seven. Like, congratulations, guys. Thank you. When I prayed this morning,

-Yeah. So only -two people move on.
-You don't get to do anything. This is the end. Bhanu, are you guys okay? I... No, I think, um, tonight's
gonna be my last Tribal. Tonight's gonna be my last,
and that's how it's been for me. Would you like a hug? -Okay.
-Come on, buddy. (Bhanu sniffles) Just remember, you still
have a Shot in the Dark, too. -And you still
might win an advantage.
-LIZ: And... -Yeah, who knows? I mean...
-It's, uh... I'm always on the out and
not in any strategy discussions. Tiffany and Q are really tight. -Amen. I can see that.
-Yeah. -You can see that.
Everyone can see that.
-Yeah. And Kenzie's a mastermind. -Kenzie is running
the show at our camp.
-Oh. Kenzie's the one who's actually, like, influencing Tiffany. LIZ:
The brains? BHANU:
Yeah, she's the brain. Whatever order she wanted,
that's happening. And tonight, it's me,
because, of course, she... she wants to stay in the game. And-and Tiffany and Q--
they don't vote for each other. So that-that's my position. LIZ:
 Bhanu has a meltdown,
 so we just let him unravel and he tells us everything. It is a gold mine
of information. So I just stay quiet and I just let him talk. (sobbing):
I need a miracle. LIZ:
 And unless he is Leonardo DiCaprio, I cannot not believe this man. BEN:
This is a game of emotions. So don't be hard on yourself
for being emotional. Make that your fuel. They say that I'm not strategic. They say that I'm-I'm only
emotional, and I'm a fool. -That's all I am.
-They said that? BEN:
That does not rock. -Oh, my gosh. That's just mean.
-BHANU: (sniffles) Yeah. -BEN: Strategies are working.
-BHANU: They said, ""You have to know
when to hold and when to fold."" I said, like, you know,
""I'm playing with my heart."" I'm not strategic, but my poi...
my point being on Survivor is not to win a million dollars. I want to win a million hearts. -That's more important to me.
-Oh. So I'm here for that journey
and not for the money. And everyone knows about that. Well, here's one heart. Here's another, dude. Like Bhanu said, ""I didn't come
 to win a million dollars. I came to win a million hearts."" A little corny, but, like,
when you're raw like that, it hits.
You know what I'm saying? That's like an Oasis line,
for sure, okay? ""A million hearts"" on three. One, two, three. ALL:
A million hearts. -All right, Bhanu.
-Go for it. BHANU:

You just went on a journey. It should have been fun. Nothing exciting happened. Well, um, it's not like
what Jelinsky described. This time, it said, ""you guys
have to draw three rocks. ""One is a white rock,
two blue rocks. ""If you draw a blue rock,
then you have to do something and then you win,
maybe, an immunity"" or something like that. If you drew a white rock,
then you have to go home. Like, go to the camp. -KENZIE: Okay.
-BHANU: So we did it.
-You drew the white rock? -That's right.
-TIFFANY: Damn, daddy. And then, yeah,
I just came back, and... that's about the tea. KENZIE: Of course,
 in typical Yanu fashion, he gets nothing,
which works for us, because we didn't want him
to have anything. He drew the white rock. He doesn't have anything. Great for the plan, but it is also just hilarious that, once again,
Yanu loses another thing and gives something else
to the other tribe. Did they ask you about, like, what you think
is gonna happen tonight? I said my name is gonna
be on the chopping block, because that's inevitable, and, um... Okay. Well, thanks for the tea.
That was juicy. The real tea
 is what he gave them about us. I feel like there was more that he might have
 given them, but it doesn't seem like
he got any type of advantage
or whatever from the journey,
 which is a good thing. So now it's not a possibility. It's a definite. Bhanu's going home tonight. Q:
 So you didn't have
 to lose your vote or anything with the white rock? -No?
-What do you think? You lost your vote? I didn't want
to tell in front of them, -but I-I cannot lie to you, man.
It's, like...
-Okay. No, no, no, no,
I'm-I'm with you. Bhanu is just
 in a world of his own. This is too much for him. He has a passion for the game but he doesn't understand
 the game. So he needs a guy like me
 to help him, because, right now,
 Tiff and Kenzie-- they're 100% in with sending Bhanu home. But I have a different plan. I tell you, we have, in this game,
we have liabilities and we have threats. In this game, we want
to get rid of the threats and help the liability
become an asset, which I think
that's what you can be. I want Bhanu to stay. In my world, a liability can be an asset if you use it the right way. And I think Bhanu is the liability, but I can
 control that liability. We're not... Kenzie is a threat. A threat can never
 be used to your favor. At some point
 it's gonna come up and bite. So, for me, I want Bhanu
 to stay in this game and for Kenzie to go home. I'm willing
to put in so much effort to helping you
become the better player. I think once Tiff
understands how much time that I'm willing
to put in with you, she will
change her vote to Kenzie. Kenzie'll go home. BHANU: My game tonight rests in Q's able hands. Put it on me.
I promise I'll fix it. -Okay? I got you covered.
-Bro. How much he can do,
 I don't know, but I still believe in miracles. So let's see. -Hear me out.
-Okay. I've thought about it.
Bhanu will always vote with us. He's gonna vote
 wherever we tell him. We don't know what Kenzie's
 gonna do with herself once she get around
other people. This dude will play the game that we want him to play. Kenzie is gonna play Survivor. She's gonna get over there, she's gonna make bonds,
 relationships. And if it can get her
further in the game, bro, she gonna
get rid of my ass, and she'll get rid of you
to push her way forward. Bhanu has said it over and over:
""I just want to make the jury."" Kenzie wants to win. TIFFANY:
 Q was actually making really valid arguments to the point where, like,
I'm even questioning, ""Like, dang, like,
maybe-maybe he could be right."" Because me, as a Survivor fan, if I was watching somebody play with somebody
 as charismatic and charming and smart
 as Kenzie... I'm really glad we met. TIFFANY:
 ...I probably would be like, ""Dang. Like, maybe you do
 need to cut that person."" But me, being a Survivor player, and actually having
a relationship with Kenzie, I feel like
Kenzie and I are close. And while
she is savvy and smart, I think she's on my side. Bhanu is a liability,
but Kenzie's a threat to me. I-I agree with you
about everything you said, but I still... My gut is telling me that
it has to be Bhanu tonight. ( ♪ ♪ ) I'm getting

what you learned? DR. WILL:
So, Randen,
when you first had this injury, we were concerned initially
that it was a pinched nerve. And it could
be anywhere from the neck right down to the arm. We thought it was
because of sleeping on the hard bamboo floor,
and it was lower down in the radial,
what we call the radial nerve. PROBST:
And the radial nerve--
that's what allows you -to grip and move, and... Okay.
-That's right. And we thought that your radial
nerve wasn't working properly. Essentially, you put it to sleep
by sleeping on a hard bamboo floor and that's
why your wrist is not working. The thing that's
been concerning me has been this worsening pain
and tenderness in your neck. When I consulted my colleague,
who's a neurosurgeon, -her big concern
was this could be a bulging disc -in your neck,
-(Soda gasps) which presses on the nerve, and that's, I'm afraid,
a very different beast. The radial nerve problem
gets better by itself, but a disc pressing on
the nerve here may need surgery. PROBST:
And the-the obvious problem is that Will can't do that with the kind of assessment
he can do out here. You need an MRI. And so, Randen,
for those reasons, out of just being
very cautious about your health, we are pulling you
from the game. You understand, you don't want to risk something
that could be serious. No, I understand.
I understand, Jeff. I don't want to have
paralysis of any kind. You know what I mean?
I got a life to live, so... And it's unfortunate
that it's an unknown. It could be this radial nerve
and you could be okay, -but Will's been doing
a lot of research
-I know you have. and trying to make sure
that we take care of you, and this is the right move. Oh, my God. I'm listening to every word
the doc is saying. When Jeff said he's gonna
 remove me from the game, I was devastated. I'd rather have gotten
 voted out, like, fighting, you know, but, uh,
 sometimes there's things that are
 just out of your control. Venus, what are you
feeling right now? Honestly, I'm heartbroken
for him, Jeff. This has been
an amazing journey, and he's probably
one of the most amazing people I've ever met. And it's gonna
be hard to picture the rest of this experience
without him, and I'm just really upset. So, Randen, what is the feeling?
You've got, clearly, a lot of love
from this group of people you've been
living with. What's this experience
been like for you? You know, Jeff, uh, the time I spent here, I got
to know these amazing people. You know, every day was a gift. Nobody in my family history has
ever done anything like this. This is an opportunity
of a lifetime, and I cherish all of you. One of you guys
better win a million dollars and keep
the Nami legacy going, winning. You know what I'm saying? -I love all of you guys,
honestly.
-I love you, Randen. -RANDEN: All right?
-I love you, buddy.
-Good job, dawg. Thank you. All right, Randen,
so we have an MRI -already scheduled for you
in the morning.
-Oh, that's great. PROBST:
So we need to get you
out of here, transported, so we can get this looked at. As for the rest of you,
as Survivor always does, it continues on,
and you are now a tribe of five. All right, let's go, Randen.
See you all again. -Hope you feel better tonight.
-Love you, buddy. VENUS:
 My closest ally's going home
with an advantage in his pocket, and it sucks. I'm heartbroken for him, but I'm also very upset that the
one person I could really trust is now gone,
and now I have no one. And it just feels really ... -Thank you, guys.
-LIZ: Love you. SODA: Love you, Randen. Bye! We love you! VENUS:
 I am at the bottom
 of this tribe. My days are numbered, and
 I'm pretty much screwed. But honestly, at this point, I've
realized, in Survivor, you can't predict anything. (Bhanu crying, sniffling) What are you crying for? I don't want
to see you like this. I'm-I'm sorry. This... No, I know. I know. (sighs) I'll be honest with you. Like... I have not decided
to write your name down. BHANU:
I told you I always
respected you all, and sometimes I call you sister, because that-that comes from... straight from my heart, and... Hold up. I know I'm interrupting. I know you got a lot going on,
but I've got news -that's gonna impact tonight.
-Yo, Jeff is here! Hey, Q. Kenzie. -My heart is beating so fast.
-KENZIE: Mine, too. Well, I came in
clearly interrupting a passionate conversation.
I can see it in your face. So I think what
I have to tell you is going to impact all four of you. Randen was pulled from the game. He's had a nerve situation.
There was a lot of concern. So for, you know,
his well-being, we had to pull him
from the game, which means one person's loss is another person's gain. No Tribal Council tonight. -Nobody going home
from this tribe.
-Hug. (laughing) (excited chatter) -Oh, my God.
-See, buddy, I told you. BHANU:
 My prayer's been answered. I'm not going home tonight. Here I am, saying my goodbyes,
 ready to go, and look what happened.
Miracle! I wanted to tell you that,
you know, I came here because you inspired me
to be on Survivor, because you're my guru. That's what brought me here. And I never came to Survivor to win a million dollars. I wanted
to win a million hearts. That's my focus. So I had my speech prepared
for you tonight. (chuckles) PROBST:
No need for the speech.
You might want -to work on your gurus,
but I appreciate the nice words.
-(laughing) BHANU:
 I've been praying all day. And guess what? I'm still in the game, baby. This is the first time
I'm actually, like, smiling and laughing. (laughs) Q, this game
is impossible to predict. What does this moment
offer this group? Second chance, Jeff. You just gave somebody on this tribe a second life, and I'm thankful. Tiff, what's your feeling? I'll be honest with you,
like, I was really struggling, because we've been,
like, losing people left and right. Literally, like,
I said a prayer. I'm like, ""God, this is gonna
be hard tonight. Can you please give me a sign?"" And then you walk in
five minutes later. I'm so happy,
because I do not want any more people from my tribe
to go home. I really don't. Kenzie, I think
you all are on to something with this approach
that this is a victory. I just left Randen, who is obviously very sad, and yet that
is how Survivor works. His pain is your joy. KENZIE:
Yeah, I mean, it...
Obviously, like, my heart goes out to him, 100%. Like, that sucks, but it's like our first win. You know? Like... I hate to relish in that, but
we got to relish where we can. You know? Well, Survivor is full of turning points. They often come
when you least expect it. This could be the first positive turning point for Yanu. It is the first positive
turning point for Yanu. BHANU:
This is really a positive turn.
Oh, my... All right, I'm gonna
leave the four of you to enjoy the sunset. It'll be a very different night. And the game continues. -Thank you.
-TIFFANY: Thanks, Jeff. -Thank you so much.
-Okay. All right. Good luck. -Thank you.
-Thank you. Q:
 Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close
 she came to going home. But this is a win
 for the Yanu tribe. For the first time,
 we're not going to Tribal. We can keep everyone together. All four members. One happy family. And that feels great. Captioning sponsored by

 a chance to build upon it. I'm feeling good about it. Why? I said something wrong. TIFFANY:
What? I said,
""Kenzie's the mastermind here."" I just... That's one thing I said. And they... they-they said, ""Are Tiff and Q, like, close?"" I was like,
""Yeah, they're close."" There's nothing
wrong in that, right? Is that close?
Is that-is that bad? I kind of don't really
want them to know how close me and Q are,
'cause then they're -gonna try to split us up.
-But they always
see you guys like this. So they've asked me
that one question. I-I'm just, like,
being so clear. So there's just, like... 'Cause then they're
gonna try to break us up. That's all I said.
And that's it. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Mm. Huh?! Boy... If you can't realize that going to a journey
 to meet two other people from other tribes,
and they're asking you questions about players on your tribe,
 that they're pumping you for information,
you are a liability. -He going over there

-I-I can't. I can't. I-I can't. -There's no more
going back to it.
-Bro, like... Now, he put a target
on Kenzie back, and he put a target
on both of our back. -He got to go.
-Yeah. TIFFANY:
 And I wonder what
 you said about yourself. I'm sure he's probably like,
 ""You know, I'm just on the bottom right now,

like some friggin' sob story. And everybody looks like
a big threat except for him. Yep. Done. TIFFANY:
 If I would have voted out
 Kenzie and kept Bhanu and then found out
 all this information, I just would have
jumped headfirst into the ocean. I'd have been so pissed. About the Kenzie thing? About all of it. Did I say something wrong? Q: Not only
 did he put a huge target on Kenzie's back, which I don't really mind. Now the target on my back
is not only ""curious, young, ""he's athletic,
he's a physical threat. ""Oh, by the way,
add the fact that... he's a duo with Tiff."" Oh, man. That ""yes"" had so much meaning. Ah, ... BHANU: I shouldn't
 have said that to them, but I said it in good faith
 because I wanted to be honest with my tribe. (groans) BHANU:
The target on Kenzie was on and
we were going to Tribal Council. Everything is gonna go
 according to the plan, and me just
spilling everything out... (sighs) It just messed
the whole game for me. And he was like, ""Yeah, that's
because she's the mastermind, and she's
running the show over there."" Bitch. Target number one,
two and three-- me, you and Q. He just... Aah! Like, I'm so mad at him. -Are you dumb?
-After we reamed him at Trib-- about the Jess Tribal? He's literally like a toddler.

""Don't touch the oven."" And he does and then he cries. TIFFANY:

so just to catch everybody up, Randen was suffering
with an issue in his arm. It was a pinched nerve,
but our medical team was very concerned
about possible long-term damage, so we had to make
the tough decision to end Randen's journey in favor
of his long-term health, which means
there was no Tribal Council. Nobody from Yanu went home. That tribe stays intact. TIFFANY:

Keep it in the middle.
Stay calm. Yes! -That's what I'm talking about.
-Liz has it for Nami. You're good. Start digging. -BEN: Maria!
-PROBST: It's now Maria
feeling the pressure. -TIM: Just like that...
-You got this. It's okay. PROBST:
Everybody else has a ring. Maria, the last person left. CHARLIE:
We got tons of time here. PROBST:
She's got
to get it over that pole or Siga cannot
continue in this challenge. Two tribes are gonna win reward. Yanu would like
to be first for once. (overlapping chatter) Q getting closer.
Q has the first ring. -SODA: You're good. You're good.
-LIZ: He needs the ring, right? Ah! -TIM: Once more. You got it.
-CHARLIE: Okay. -You got this.
-Take your,
take your deep breathes. Find your calm. -Find your calm.
-PROBST: Maria struggling, trying to get that ring
over that pole. KENZIE:
You got this, Q.
You got this, Q. (cheering) PROBST:
Q has the second ring for Yanu. -(cheering)
-And a third. Is this a new Yanu tribe
that's being birthed? KENZIE:
Right there. Right there, baby. PROBST:
Yanu could win it right here. -And there it is.
-(cheering) Yanu wins its first challenge, day eight, Survivor 46. Oh, my God! -Good for them.
-Good for them. We're looking for one more. Maria's got
to get it off the pole -in order for Siga
to move ahead.
-Come on! -You got this, Maria.
-TIM: There you go. PROBST:
Nami has a big time lead now
for second. -It's gonna be Hunter.
-TEVIN: Don't need that. -TEVIN: Good job.
-VENUS: Yeah, Hunter! Hunter has the first ring. -Hunter with another toss.
-VENUS: Way to go, Yanu. That's up to you what you do. -I can't climb the pole?
-No. Nope. No climbing. And he did it.
Nice touch by Hunter. A little-- Move. Take one step forward.
A baby step. Baby step. -TIM: There we go.
-PROBST: There it is! -Maria has it!
-Maria! Let's go, Siga. Start digging. It's not your mindset,
it's your grindset! PROBST:
Can Siga make up
the time difference or will Hunter
close it out for Nami? -(whoops)
-Yeah! Hunter has the third ring.
Down to one ring left. TIM:
All the way. There you go. PROBST:
Five fish on the line. Hunter for the win. -There it is!
-SODA: Yeah! Nami wins reward. For the first time,
Siga gonna home empty-handed. -No.
-TIM: It's okay, M. You did your best.
You did beautiful. All right,
Yanu, congratulations. -Your first win of the season.
-LIZ: Wow. -SODA: Yeah, Yanu!
-KENZIE: Thank you.
Thanks, y'all. -Wow.
-You're okay. Don't cry. PROBST:
All right, Yanu,
you've earned ten fresh fish, good size,
delivered at your camp. But I know what you're thinking. You don't have flint,
so you have the option to trade this reward
for an earlier one. So if you wanted to trade
for the large tool kit and the large tarp and give
up the fish, you can do that. Those fish will not
do us any good right now. So the large tarp and tool kit. Large tool kit, large tarp will
be waiting for you back at camp. -Hopefully that will
change your lives quite a bit.
-LIZ: Yeah. Hell yeah. Nami, five fresh fish will be -waiting for you back at camp.
-Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you. PROBST:
Nami, grab your stuff,
head out and enjoy those fish. -TEVIN: Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you.
-We sure will. PROBST:
Siga, got nothing for you.
Grab your stuff, head out. Yanu, grab your stuff, head out. Well done. Welcome to the game. KENZIE: We didn't only win, we demolished. We beat them by a landslide, which is the opposite of what's been happening to us
 this entire time. It's, like,
the momentum that we needed. Our core four is finally
 getting it together. And that is why
you never give up on Survivor. Randen's out. Yanu gets new life

-Where's the fish? I really wanted
to cut and clean the fish because my dad
showed me how to do it, and I haven't done it since I did it with my dad. ♪ ♪ I had been trying to go fishing
with him for about three years, but I was
 so busy with my career and I kept being like,
 ""Oh, I can't do it."" You know,
""I can't do it. I can't do it."" And then the time to do it
is eternally past. My dad passed away about ten months ago. And so I didn't get to fish with
him that one last time, so... It was just nice to do something
 today that was just, like... Dad's right here. We had a very
 powerful relationship. When I didn't have a car, he gave me
 his one and only car, so that I could get
 back and forth to high school. And he had no transportation. And he called me
 every single day just to say, ""Hey, how are you doing?"" One of the hardest parts
about him passing was that, the day after he passed,
my phone didn't ring. -SODA: Wow!
 -LIZ: Wow. We ready. -Beautiful.
-TEVIN: Here they are. -SODA: Aw.
-Um, my dad taught me
how to do this. And this is, I think, the first
time I've done it without him. -But, like, I did it.
-LIZ: Oh, wow. SODA:
That's the way to fish, baby! TEVIN:
 So I was filled with pride
 to know that something my daddy taught me
 is coming into play right now. And I'm about to give
 this thing that I have crafted to these people who need it, which is what he was all about. So he lives on. (gasps) Wow. -Fantastico!
-We did it! We finally won something. (singsongy): First place.
Who would have thought? That's crazy. We really
bodied that whole challenge. KENZIE:
Yeah, we did. TIFFANY:
 We blew those other teams
 out today. Oh, that's real big. But this win
 was bigger than us just winning a tarp and some tools. This could definitely be
 a turning point for our tribe. If we could really
 get our stuff together, we might
not have to lose anymore. Go to your right. Go to my... Opposite side of the girls
right now. I'm exactly at
the opposite side of the girls. -Go to the other side
of the shelter.
-KENZIE: Go that way. Onto the girls' side. TIFFANY:
No, we-- You are on the girls'
side. Go to the other side. Q:
 I know that if we go
 to Tribal next, Bhanu is the one
 that's going home. But if he's going to be around, I have to make sure that Bhanu is the best player that he can be. Just stay in the moment,
stay in the current. But I think there's so much that Bhanu don't understand
and don't know about the game of Survivor. We have to fix
your social and strategic game to where it's not a liability. So what I'm doing is taking
 my time to actually train him, and that is my job as the coach. We're having coaching sessions. Hopefully I can teach him how to keep his mouth shut. You need to be thinking
about every moment. From here on out, start playing
conversations in your head. In this game, you have a lot of people
who want to manipulate you. They ask you questions
and they buddy you up. -Mm.
-And you feel like, ""Oh, my God.
I got to give something back."" No, the ... you don't. My training with Bhanu
 is training his emotions, training his speech. So you don't want me
to talk strategy at all? Teaching him techniques to use in general conversations
with others. Tonight, who you voting for? I don't know who I'm voting for. -Would you vote Tiff tonight?
-Oh, yeah, sure. So you're voting Tiff? So that right there
was a bit too much, 'cause you jumped on it
too quick. Oh... Q:
 And I'm teaching him how to talk at Tribal. So, Bhanu, what's going on at your camp?
We're merged. This is Jeff talking to you. We're vibing with everybody. You know, it's-it's cool. And when you say ""we,""
who is we, Bhanu? Everybody.
I'm vibing with all of them. Perfect, Bhanu. BHANU:
Is that Jeff or coach talking? Oh, okay. Q:
 I'm not very optimistic about his approach
 going forward, but if the little bit
 that I can teach him can help, I'm going to continue to try. What did you learn? Tell me. Ask me the same question, coach. -KENZIE: Just-just tell me...
-No, just tell her
what you learned. BHANU:
So, this is what I learned. When Jeff asks, like, ""Hey, Bhanu.
So what's going on?"" I would be like,
""Things are good, you know? We're all
vibing with each other."" I'm glad you're practicing. I want to practice
with you, too. We'll have more sessions. -I'll have more.
-Mm-hmm. I'll-I'll have it
with Kenzie, too. -Kenzie?
-Yeah? I am helping you. Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, you are now. -I will help you.
-Yes. I just want to enjoy our win
for, like, five minutes. -I want to not
talk about strategy.
-Oh, sorry. I'm just gonna walk away. You have
the patience of a saint. I snapped at Bhanu because you are probably
15 years older than me. Like, I... shouldn't have
to help you play Survivor. And, of course, Bhanu is like,
 ""I'll just walk away."" I'm like, ""Okay. Go."" I'm over it.
 I'm over babying Bhanu. It's so annoying. BEN:
Let's start with the positives. This was
just a reward challenge. And I want to say that even in the face of all the insanity, you guys were still a team and I couldn't
be more proud of y'all. So, you know, Maria, I know you feel like
the weight is on your shoulders because it was
that whole situation. But I still did it. -You still did it.
-Yeah. But, yeah, also, every single
person out there believed in you and trusts you and doesn't
put any ounce of blame on you. JEM:
And we don't even-- -It's just fish, Maria.
It's not that big a deal.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:
You know what? As immigrants, success was survival
for my family. And so we grew up where we had to be perfect. And so I never wanted to fail. So many times I wondered, like,
""Am I enough? Am I good enough?"" You know? And this was, like,
a big, big place... to fail
in front of a lot of people. Growing up, our parents
 wanted so much for us. They came from Lebanon
 to this country and worked so hard. And so, you know,
we-we were pushed hard. We were pushed with this
 sort of fire in us to succeed. And when there were moments in life
when I didn't, you know, I was hard on myself. What I've worked on
the last couple years is shedding the shame...
(sniffles) the shame and the guilt
behind not succeeding. And just knowing
that it's a moment in time, and that doesn't define
who I am. BEN:
Listen, Maria, you're gon-- I know you're
taking this loss hard, but it's gonna
be a lesson for you in more of that
letting go of shame. -Yeah.
-BEN: You know what I'm saying? So either way,
whether we had the fish or not, -it's gonna be a positive.
-OTHERS: Yeah. -BEN: All right?
-Thank you. (Charlie whoops) Let's not forget,
we also have a Beware Advantage we can look for, too. -Yeah.
-All right? Because of Maria. -All right?
-CHARLIE: Yeah. JEM:
That was good. CHARLIE: This Beware Advantage,
 it drives me nuts because Maria and I
didn't get to control this potential really valuable piece of information. -MORIAH: Ready to do this?
-MARIA: Diggy, diggy. CHARLIE:
 She got so excited that she told
the whole damn tribe and, all of a sudden, this whole big group effort is going on. That's reason one
to be frustrated. I mean, this is insane. This is under a tree. This is, like,
we're digging in a tree's roots. Reason two is we can't freaking find the thing. We've dug so far
under this crazy tree. -This is a serious hole we dug.
-This is, like, unreal. CHARLIE:
 And there's nothing.
 So what the heck is going on? Because
 the next most likely option is that someone
planted it there. This feels, like, comical. We've dug out as far
as you can go under the spot. So, like, where is it? Either that
or somebody's being sneaky -and found it in another tree.
-MARIA: Someone-- Exactly. BEN:
Jeff, where is this thing, dude? Jeff don't lie. A few fundamentals in Survivor: One: Jeff will never lie to you. Two: Jeff will never
give you anything impossible. TIM:
If Jeff put this in the tree,
he's good, 'cause this is absurd. MORIAH:
 So maybe Jeff is not the reason
we're digging there. JEM:
 It's great. My game is going the way
I intended it to go, 'cause I wanted the suspicion
 to be off of me -and onto someone else. -Ah. What's the suspicion? MORIAH: We're thinking
Tim might've planted it. JEM:
'Cause, Maria, nobody else was, like, going as hard
as he was. He's overcompensating to take all the suspicions
off of him. I mean, that's
a massive possibility. JEM:
 The idea that Tim might
have the hidden immunity idol-- like, that's what I wanted. I came to play Survivor, and I'm playing as hard as I can
with what I'm given. Ah .. . so me o f th e mo st br il li an t mi nd s in b us in es s. No, not you. Or you. You! You auto-track business income and expenses

is gonna go and do stupid ... I left the camp because,
 all of a sudden, Kenzie-- she just, like,
 snapped at me. I'm being treated like...
nobody. They're not respecting me. I'm so stupid. I had so much power in the game
and now I'm like a puppet, and they're the puppet masters. They're like, ""Do this, do that,
do this, do that."" And this is what I get. I've seen all the seasons
 of Survivor as a superfan, but when it comes
 to social skills, it's still not sinking in me. Everyone feels like
 I'm a dumb dumbo. ""Oh, we need to teach him how to walk, how to talk."" So I became a robot,
so I'm no longer a Bhanu. I'm just, like, you know, I... They're like puppeteers
and I'm a puppet. It feels... it...
I-I don't like that. Take your moment. I'll go apologize.
I don't want him to spiral. I snapped at Bhanu, and then, because I know he's emotional,
I know that I have
to go run damage control so that Bhanu doesn't think
everybody's mad at him again. Bhanu? I'm, like, one foot
 in front of the other just trying to find this man
 so I can apologize... Bhanu? ...when any other person
 would be like, ""Maybe I shouldn't
enlist her to, like, ""train me on how to do the thing we came out here
to do right now."" But we have to make Bhanu
 feel good because if we go on a winning streak
and we take Bhanu to the merge, we need him
to stay loyal to Yanu. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Like, we are a tribe. We want to keep our numbers. We need you
to be successful at Tribal. Like, I'm here to help you. -Thank you. Thank you.
-'Cause we need you. And I know it's hard. I feel so bad that
here is this old child-man -that needs help.
-It's okay. I love you.
All right, we'll get through it. BHANU:
Kenzie came to me and said like, ""I really... I apologize."" Makes me feel better. And I was like,
 ""Okay, you know what? Uh, bygones, bygones."" Thank you for understanding.
Cool. BHANU:
 I can take some lessons. Like, you know,
 I know it's very important for my game,
 for everyone's game. If so many people
 are putting work into me, I think I need
to put some effort in it. -LIZ: Perfect.
-TEVIN: There you go. All right, I'm gonna wash shirt,
pants, socks. LIZ:
If anybody sees some dirty orange underwear... -TEVIN: Ooh.
-SODA: Right there.
-...holler at me. I haven't
washed my shorts at all, and then these two undies. I feel like
 my game's going pretty well. There's five people
in this tribe. I personally feel like
there's a solid three with Hunter, Tevin, and I,
 which leaves, on the minority, Liz and Venus. LIZ:
I found my underwear! Yay! But you have a lot of downtime when you win because
you do not have to go to Tribal. Guys, I just realized something. Those two little triangles
at the bottom of our flag look like slices of pizza. Even though I'm pretty good
 at just being, like, kumbaya, your head has to constantly
be in this game. You know, I like
to check in and stuff, see where people's heads are at. You know I really want
to connect with you. I want to stay connected to you. And you are
my confidant out here. Like, it's 100% me, Liz, you, Tevin and Hunter. There's nothing
that this fab five cannot do. If you're even out of the game
for a second and you get stuck, that's it. You will be out like a light.
 You'll be gone. -Like, what...
-I feel like she knows that, like, we are tight, and I feel like that three going
into the merge is gonna be super powerful three. And I know this is tight,
so I'm not worried. Hmm. Soda is a social butterfly,
 as am I. However, she's playing the game
a little too hard for me. -Soda. -TEVIN: There's moments
 where I'm watching her, and it seems like she's having little whisper moments
 behind my back. -We're all vibing, but...
-Yeah. I'm down for individual vibes
because I love everyone. TEVIN:
 I'm just a little worried
 that she may be playing me just as
 she's playing everyone else. And it breaks my heart to say it
because I do have a connection with her
 that is so deep. But the target in which
 I am seeking to hit now is shifting. And so now
 I need to be the one to get into everyone's head
 and plant seeds. For tribe strength,
I would rather get rid of Venus than Soda, but you already know that Soda is playing a real... game. I would rather
keep our game alive and have a weaker tribe than... So are you saying, just making it seem like
 it's Venus, and then we just
 switch it to Soda? HUNTER:
 I think that's
 the safest 'cause... TEVIN:
 'Cause she wouldn't expect it? HUNTER:
 She wouldn't expect it. Yeah. I actually have wanted Soda out
for a while because she's my competition
for closeness with Tevin. So whenever Tevin
 started expressing doubt in Soda, you know, that sounds great to me.
Let's do it, right? I just want to ask, if we have
to go to Tribal Council, how do you feel if we were...
had to vote Soda? Because my gut is telling me, ""Tevin, you got
to play the game."" And if playing the game
means that I have to get somebody out of this game who I think
is manipulating everyone... To be honest with you,
I think she's the one to beat. This is great news
 for me because I really have this feeling that if Soda makes it
 to the merge, Soda is on her way
 to final Tribal Council, and I cannot have that. Yeah. TEVIN:

 are on board. Like, Soda got to Go-da. Pa in h it s fa st . So get relief fast. Only Tylenol Rapid Release

immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,

 to the top of a tall tower and leap out into the ocean. You're then gonna climb up onto
 a crate, jump back into the ocean. Two players will be responsible for releasing
 a net full of buoys. Once everybody's at the finish, one player will attempt
 to land those buoys in three baskets. First two tribes to finish win immunity,
safe from the vote. Losers, Tribal Council where somebody will be
the fourth person voted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint. Yanu, day nine. You are still fighting to get yours.

Come on, Bhanu! It is taking a long time
to get that buoy back to Q. Tim scores the second.
Siga down to one. Bhanu's out, Tiff is in. Yanu once again
facing Tribal Council. And Q nails the second. Yanu with an opportunity
to win it right here. Can he do it? No. PROBST:
For the win. Let's go! Siga! PROBST:
And he's got it. Siga wins immunity, sending Yanu back
to Tribal Council, where the fourth person
will be voted out of this game. (cheering) Nami, congratulations again. Immunity is yours. Once again,
nobody going home from Nami. Enjoy your ceremonial
leap off of the deck. (whoops) Swim out to your boat. That's what victory looks like
in the water. Siga, congratulations again. Immunity is yours. Your tribe stays intact. Head out, enjoy the night off. (whoops) (indistinct shouting) (whooping) PROBST:
All right, Yanu, same result. Tribal Council tonight. Somebody will be
the fourth person voted out of Survivor 46. You know the drill.

who it's gonna be. And-- sorry for you--

 that Yanu would win an immunity challenge? It was a dream that just got squandered
 before our eyes yet again. But tonight, we're all voting out Bhanu. Q: Bhanu's a great guy,

about Bhanu this afternoon? TIFFANY:

All right. I'd like to go back, since we didn't get to
have Tribal last time, and talk about the journey. Bhanu, you were selected
to go on that journey. How'd that go? I went on this journey and, um, I lost my vote. Not only that,
but I revealed that Q and Tiff, when I asked, like, are they working together,
I said like, ""Yes."" And then I also said, like, you know, Kenzie
is a good game player. PROBST:
Tiff, did you ask Bhanu what his motive was
in giving away this information? TIFFANY:
Yes. I don't know if I've got an actual answer, but it seemed like
he didn't understand that by revealing
that information, he was putting a target
on all three of us. Like, I just don't think
he understood in that moment that he was getting played. PROBST:
So, Bhanu, is it that
you want to play that way or is part of it figuring out how to play Survivor and
you're still figuring it out? Jeff, the first
six days has been... Like, I'm not clicking,
like how to play the game. Sixth day,
the moment it clicked, and then, I spilled the beans
to my Tribemates. So when I'm trying
to get the game, the game took over,
and I dug my grave so deep, I couldn't come out of it. PROBST:
So I'm getting a sense that... You're already nodding.
You finish. What was I gonna say? That Bhanu
is going home tonight. -Is that what's happening?
-Yes. I told Bhanu straight up,
I'm writing that name down. -Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I have to write his name. And Bhanu, you don't have a
vote, which means you can't play -the Shot in the Dark.
-No. PROBST:
It requires a vote to sacrifice. And this would then
make me think that you've all talked about
idols, and you don't have one. I've searched nine days, Jeff, for an idol, and I've done everything,
but I don't have anything. I don't have a vote,
I-I don't have an idol. I don't have alliances. I screwed up this game big-time. Well, it's rare
when this happens, but I find it intoxicating because there's
no deception happening. You're not trying
to blindside somebody. You've all been honest
with Bhanu. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Honest. The word of Bhanu's whole time
out here-- honesty. So, Bhanu,
what is your Survivor journey? -What has it been?
-Jeff, the reason why I'm on this show is because I want to share my story. I told them that
I had a very good life, but that's a lie. (laughs) I was born into poverty
to a teenage mother, and was abandoned
by my maternal father when I was three months old. -And where were you?
-I was in India. After a few years,
my mom got married, moved to a different city, and I
was living with my grandparents. And can you describe
a little bit -what poverty is like
in India for you?
-BHANU: Yes. So, the poverty
is just like the camp. -That was my house in India.
-PROBST: Literally? -Like, a thatched roof?
-A thatched roof, yes. And that's how I grew up.
I grew up literally on streets. But I learned to be honest
and help each other, and that's how we all survived. I put in a lot of effort,
and I am the first one in my entire family
to graduate from high school, first one
to have a graduate degree, first one to actually move to United States. And I also found my partner. So, all these things. So, the reason why I wanted
to be on Survivor is because there's so many Bhanus
still out there, still living in poverty. So all the Bhanus
out there, listen. There is always hope,
and you can move mountains. And if I can
come from that place, a lot of people can also do it. But, unfortunately, this is how it... it's ending, so, it's on me. Thank you so much
for this opportunity, and thank you, tribe. -Thank you for
sharing that with us.
-Yeah. Yeah. Q:
You know, Bhanu, I want you
to understand, brother, you've done a great job with the man
you've become today. And the man that you were
in our tribe showed us that, man, we could count on you
for a lot of things. PROBST:
You know, Bhanu,
one time you said to me, I am your guru, -which I took as a compliment.
-Yes, sir. But also, remind yourself you're your own guru. What you've done
with your life is remarkable. And I say this all the time. The game of Survivor is about the adventure, putting yourself
in this environment to see what you're capable of, and that's what
you've been doing. You won my heart, Bhanu, -all of our hearts.
-Mine, too. Seriously. All right, Bhanu,
when you're ready. Bhanu, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Thanks for being here. Love you, Bhanu. Q:
Love you, man. (Bhanu sniffles) (crying quietly) (sniffles) Grab your torches.

-And you're, ""What?"" And right now, I've given myself two pathways on this next vote. I've worked really hard to plant this idea with Ben,
 with Kenzie, with Liz, that we can take out
 Maria and Q. BEN:
 I will say, there's only one bonus to me being
a total idiot last night. KENZIE:
What? BEN:
Is that I think Maria and Q might think
that's, like, a wedge. -KENZIE: Between us? Yeah.
-CHARLIE: Sure.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 At the same time,
 I could stick with Maria and Q who trust me completely, but part of me is, like,
what if I just do what I set out to do with Maria? That'd be awesome. So, I have to really think about what's best for my game, and it's just such a dilemma at this point. And it's a-a different dilemma than anything
I've faced this game. You know, I voted out people
 who I've really liked, but no one like Maria, who I've played
 the whole game with, and who I consider
 to be my best friend out here. But I can't be waffling
 back and forth. Now is the time where I have
to be laser-focused on getting to the end,
 and I have to make a decision. WE A LL H AV E OB ST AC LE S, CH AL LE NG ES , AT D IF FE RE NT PO IN TS I N LI FE . I ST IL L PU SH MY SE LF P HY SI CA LL Y EV ER Y SI NG LE DA Y.

-Hiya. Look at that. Down to six. I know. -We're a little motley crew
over here.
-It's working. Whatever you're doing,
you're still here. Hi, Jeff. Good morning, Liz. All right, shall we get
to today's reward challenge? (all voicing assent) PROBST:
 For today's challenge, you're gonna race
 over an obstacle to collect a bag
 containing a ball. You'll then
 cross a ladder bridge, moving that bag
 along a twisting rope. Once your bag is free, you'll crawl under
 one final obstacle. When you reach the end,
 you'll maneuver that ball through a maze. First person
to finish wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yes.
-Yes, sir.
-Please. The winner will be taken
to the sanctuary, where good things happen,
for an afternoon -of Chinese takeout.
-Oh!
-KENZIE: Oh. You called it. PROBST:
Those little familiar
white boxes will be waiting over there
to fill your tummies. -Oh.
-PROBST: Worth playing for? -Yeah!
-Absolutely.
-All right, we'll draw for spots, we'll get it on.
Let's do this. Ooh. -PROBST: All right.
-CHARLIE: Dumplings! PROBST:
For reward at the sanctuary. -(Kenzie whoops)
-Survivors ready? (insect buzzing) Go!
You're gonna high-step this, -and it's going to burn.
-Oh! My God, but... PROBST:
Q making quick work of it. Look at Charlie...
high-stepping it. -(Kenzie gasps)
-There goes Maria. -Wow.
-Ben, Kenzie, Liz in the end. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Untie the first two knots,
start moving that bag... through this ladder bridge. You're moving that bag
along the rope, and you're moving your body
across the ladder bridge. Wherever that rope goes,
your bag goes. Wherever the bridge goes,
your body goes. We are still very even. Big maze at the end, where anything can happen. It's Maria in the lead.
She's won immunity twice. Come on. Go. Maria's across. You're good. Untie that other rope now
and free that bag. Charlie's good.
Liz is good. Q is good. Ben's across. -There's Kenzie now.
-I got it. PROBST:
Charlie's got his rope
all the way through. Maria has her bag. She's under that final obstacle. -Q is through.
-What? PROBST:
He's under the obstacle. Ow. PROBST:
Maria first to the maze. Q right behind her. Get that ball out,
start working on it. Pull down to release your maze. Here's Charlie. PROBST:
It is Kenzie, Ben and Liz still working to free their bag
with that ball. Here comes Liz. -Good luck, y'all.
-PROBST: Here comes Kenzie. Ben still back there. I'm so bad, I'm laughing. PROBST:
This maze requires a nice touch and a lot of patience. Charlie drops, got to start
again. You're gonna drop. It's gonna take you a few times
to figure this out. Here comes Kenzie.
She's in it now. Liz is here. She's in it. PROBST:
Ben has his bag.
Let's go, Ben! Maria making some progress. Q making a little progress. Jeff, you know
I'm cranking ""Pinball Wizard"" in my head right now. PROBST:
Maria doing a nice job. She has slowed down. Very patient. Charlie drops again. Aah! PROBST:
Maria drops.
She's got to start again. Q drops.
Everybody's in it once again. This is anybody's challenge
to win. (exhales sharply) Ooh, ooh! PROBST:
Kenzie doing a nice job. Now Kenzie and Ben. Nope, it's just Kenzie. And Ben drops. It's Kenzie. Charlie trying
to make a run at it again, trying to catch Kenzie. Ooh! Okay, come on. -Ah.
-PROBST: Maria drops. Q gonna start again. Kenzie doing a nice job, making tiny movements. Charlie trying to catch her. Ah. PROBST:
Kenzie still in the lead. Ooh, ooh, ooh! -...
-PROBST: Kenzie drops. It's Charlie in the lead
right now. CHARLIE:
Let's go, Charlie. PROBST:
Liz doing a nice job.
Liz is in this. Maria once again
back out on the maze. Kenzie's out there now,
making some progress. Charlie navigates
one passageway. Liz right on his tail. Charlie getting very close. Liz right there. -Oh...
-PROBST: Liz drops.
She's got to start again! Charlie inching closer
and closer. He's inside the inner circle. Can he get it to stick? For reward. And he's done it! -LIZ: Oh, wow.
-Charlie wins reward. -Afternoon at the sanctuary
-BEN: Charlie! (whoops) -for Chinese takeout.
-KENZIE: Good job, Charlie. -PROBST: Wow.
-LIZ: Good game, brother. -(Charlie groans)
-Get your stinky butt over here. All right, Charlie,
come on over. (whooping, cheering) -All right, Charlie.
-Chinese food. So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna leave here, -go to the sanctuary.
-Yeah. Chinese takeout. -Beautiful afternoon.
-Ah. I'm gonna sweeten the deal a
little bit, and in the process, maybe complicate -your decision, because...
-Ay-ay-yay. ...after you enjoy
the Chinese takeout, you will finish your afternoon
at the sanctuary with your letters from home. -Oh, God.
-Oh. LIZ:
Oh. Wow. Sorry, Charlie. PROBST:
Choose one person to join you. Oh, God. Kenzie, what is it
about the letters from home? Because when
you're watching Survivor, you say ""You've only got
a few more days. It's not that big a deal."" Um, yeah, it... I know
there are people here with kids, and peo...
Everyone here loves somebody. Um, my fiancé moved our wedding. It was supposed to be yesterday
for this, so it would just be really nice
to hear from him, but I... Charlie, don't, like... it's...
I'm not gonna hold it against you if you don't
choose me. I just... -I'm just thinking
about it, you know?
-I know. (sniffles) Choose one person, Charlie. I'm gonna choose Liz. I know Liz can eat Chinese food. -Really?
-Her daughter Chelsea is a huge Survivor fan. Those two factors.
Liz, come on. Oh, my God. BEN:
All right, Liz! -(applause)
-KENZIE: Yeah, Liz. Thank you. All right, Charlie,
four people left. You're gonna choose
one more person, which means three of you
will go to the sanctuary, three others will go back
to camp with nothing. CHARLIE:
Honestly, coming into this, I was thinking the people
who didn't eat pizza would come. I'm gonna take Kenzie, and
I know she had her wedding day. And I'm so sorry
to everybody else. 'Cause I know
what this is, and... -LIZ: Wow.
-I'm really, really sorry. PROBST:
Come on over. -KENZIE: Thank you.
-(Maria sniffles) (exhales) -LIZ: I'm so sorry, Maria.
-(sniffles) -Maria, I'm really sorry.
-Maria, I'm sorry. (sniffles) All right, Charlie, Liz, Kenzie, you're heading to the sanctuary for a fun afternoon
of food and love. Grab your stuff,
head out, enjoy the day. Thank you, guys. Thank you. KENZIE:
Thank you. (sniffles) Maria, all love is good love, but a parent's love is unique. -(Maria crying)
-It's like no other in that you created these people,
so your emotion is obviously understood. What is the feeling? What were you
looking forward to? I just wanted to see... I just want to see those letters
so bad, Jeff. (sniffles)
I understand his decision. I would never wish that decision
on him. It's just, it's breaking my heart in three. All right, Q, Maria, Ben,
got nothing for you. Grab your stuff,
head back to camp. No problem. MARIA: This reward challenge
 is one that I've been waiting for
 for many days, and I think my tears
were just the realization that this is the one
I've been waiting for, and I knew I couldn't go. It hurts all over.
 It hurts my head. It hurts my heart, you know? Like, I wasn't lying when I said
 my heart broke in three. If you're watching Survivor as a family, and your mom keeps saying,

-Wow. Sorry. I'm, like, ripping
open boxes like a savage. -CHARLIE: No, rip open...
-Savage! I haven't had a reward in almost ten days, and there's been
 so many feelings. Feelings I didn't even know
 that I had inside me when I don't get picked. Oh, my gosh. That's soda. And today, I'm picked. See, Liz? It all pays off not
getting picked for the pizza. -This is better.
-You know, I thought about that. -We are very lucky.
-LIZ: I thought it was a series of bad luck,
and I'm like, ""That was good
I didn't get picked."" More than eating, it feels like, ""Yes, Liz, you have done
something right in the game. ""You're working with people that want to work with you,"" and that feels just as delicious as this beef dish tastes. CHARLIE: We got love. Oh, God.
I can't even think about that. CHARLIE: Oh, I really...
I really feel for them, but... Obviously, the letters
complicate it, but, like, literally, before the letters, I
was like, ""It's Kenzie and Liz."" Like, obviously, we didn't eat -the last time, so...
-Right. CHARLIE: Not choosing Maria
 was the hardest decision I've made the entire game. But I knew that
 we were gonna be okay. She is truly a selfless, caring, just stand-up person. I told you, like, my favorite
players are Malcolm and Denise. -Like...
-Yeah, she's kind of, like,
that strong... that strong mom. CHARLIE:
 We've been saying
 we're Malcolm and Denise, and we've built
 such a tight bond over the course
of this whole season. And one reward challenge, even if it's for love,
was not gonna break that bond. I think Maria will understand. I think so, too.
She knows, you know... She knows. Mm-hmm. (Maria sniffling) I think the hardest thing...
is I can... Let it out. Take your time. I can picture them
s-sending their... writing their messages. BEN:
Yeah. Working so hard
on these letters... ...to get them to me. Charlie and I said,
 if we ever win reward, we are not taking
 the other person. So, I know why
Charlie chose how he chose, but having my three boys
 at home and not having a way
to communicate with them... (sniffles) Something died in me... today. I just... I feel like I just got robbed,
it just got taken from me. This one would have meant... I would have given up
every reward for this one. It hurts, it's very painful,
 but, like, I've been in positions before
where I've been broken down, and all I can think of is,
 like, you keep some bear cubs from mama bear. Like, I'm coming. It's gonna really

-KENZIE: I know. Cheers. -Cheers.
-Cheers.
-Oh, my gosh. Cheers. LIZ:
 I remember coming
 into the game thinking, ""Liz, you really don't want your
 letters because you're gonna have to show this emotional side
of yourself."" Aw. Chelsea. But when the letter
 is right there in your face, that's all you can think about. And so, to remind yourself of home and why I came out here
in the first place and... ...who I left behind. And it feels like motivation. (cries) I see my daughter's letter, and I see her little drawing.
(laughs) (sniffles) She's the whole reason
 I'm out here. She dared me to apply. (laughs)
 And it just... it reminds me that
 there are people in this game who are not rooting
for you, but there are people at home that are. KENZIE:
 I have no idea
what's going on with my parents. I have no idea what's going on
 with my business. I have no idea
what's going on with my fiancé. And so, getting to, like, hear that they're okay... (sniffles) There's no words to describe
how much it means out here. Wow.
This is the best thing ever. Thank you, Charlie. Ooh. I was supposed to get married
 literally yesterday, but my fiancé, when I got
 the first call for Survivor, immediately moved our wedding
because he just believed in me. And it's amazing that I have... (sighs) Sorry. (sniffles) It's just so amazing
to have a support system that allows me...
to learn, to go... to do this. You know, like, I'm used to being in charge, I'm used to, like,
 controlling everything. And I'm used to being, like,
 a perfectionist, and... relinquishing that control
was a big lesson for me to even come out here. I've been self-employed
 since I was 17. I started my career
 at 15 years old. Like, just because I thought I was the only person
 I could ever count on. But hearing that my family
 can handle everything-- like, it's allowing me to take a break and, like, I don't have
to be perfect all the time. I don't have
to be in charge all the time. Like, I can lean
on other people. This really...
I'll never forget this. -CHARLIE: Oh, my God.
-Ever. -Thank you so much.
-CHARLIE: Thank you guys -for being here. (sniffles)
-LIZ: You're awesome. CHARLIE:
 Every single letter,
 every single one makes me cry and laugh and just get
 that one little taste of home that I need to drive me through. (laughs) It's a bunch
of Taylor Swift quotes. (laughs) -Oh. From Judy?
-Yeah. Oh. CHARLIE:
 Getting to hear from Judy,
 my girlfriend, I get to see what she's thinking about this whole
 crazy experience. I miss her so much,
and think about her every day. I always thought
they were, like, all being dramatic with letters, -KENZIE: No.
-but my God. But if I remember one thing, it's that my sister, my dad, my mom, my girlfriend Judy-- they all told me to play to win. That might be what I needed to push me to make
the right decision for Charlie. Because if I'm going to
 play to win, I'm going to be betraying Maria, who I've played
 the whole game with. And those reminders to play to win are gonna fuel me
to the end of the game. ♪ ♪ CHARLIE: That was amazing. -Oh, lordy.
-This was the reward
to win, Charlie. -I know. Wow.
-That's, like, -such a bucket-list thing.
-I feel so special. I feel special, too. Thanks, Charlie. LIZ:
 Charlie's choices
 to go on this reward-- it couldn't have been
 set up any better. This is a chance
 for the three of us to actually talk strategy
 without looking suspicious. So, while it would pain me... to not go Q yet again, I do know
Maria is a bigger threat. Someone just needs
to beat Maria tomorrow. We have to get her
before Q, right? -Yeah.
-I mean, as much as that makes me gag. Yeah. -She's so good.
-KENZIE: Oh, she's good
at everything. And she made the fire
last night. I was like, ""Oh, no,
you can make fire, too?"" LIZ: I know. CHARLIE:
 This was by far
 the hardest reward decision of the season. All I can say is thank goodness Maria was not here because I am cooking something up that I don't want Maria
to sniff out of the kitchen. And that is a blindside
 of Maria at the next vote. I know Ben is solid. So, the key ingredients in this little recipe are Kenzie and Liz, so, I wanted to cement
that relationship today. Wonder what they're doing
back at camp. CHARLIE:
They'll probably
look for the idol, but I don't think it exists,
personally. Yeah.
Well, let's hope not. Q: Right now, reward means absolutely nothing to me. For me, I need to find this idol
 'cause I need protection. So the more time
that I have to snoop around, which...
I've looked a lot. They make it look so easy on television. People, I've looked for days. Days... and hours on days. Nothing. But today is different. I've told myself,
 ""Q, calm down."" Calm for the last
handful of days. Handful of. My hand is starting to hurt. I need the storm. And I think I found something that'll help this storm
come a little quicker. You just sit right there.
Hold on. Let me go in my pocket. What's in my pocket?
What's... It might be somehow! What's-what's...
what's the matter? What's going?
 Look what I found. Oh, Lord. Oh, my God.
This is a beautiful thing. (laughing quietly) I got it. And behold. I got the juice.
I got the juice now, fam. Oh! Do I tell Maria or do I don't? I just need to get through
 this last vote at six, and I'm in
the final friggin' four! Hey. Swear to God. Just found it... -Stop it.
-I swear to God. MARIA:
Let me see what it looks like. Q:
 I told Maria
 about the idol because you have to trust somebody. -I'm not telling anybody else.
-No, no, no, no, no. Q:
 And Maria is my number one. So, now, her knowing
 that I have the idol, she's now
more likely to protect me. Yeah, yeah. -Yeah.
-So... MARIA:
 That's a really nice offer. Like, if I have someone
who's telling me he's willing
to play this for me, I definitely want
 to keep him around. So maybe that's my best move now. I think it's
imperative Liz goes next. Q:
Yep. We just
have to make sure Charlie don't pull a fast one
with those girls. I don't think he would. I'm not worried about Charlie
doing anything with them. But would Charlie
need to go before them? It would make...
It would be safe. MARIA:
 This is the first time
 that I've actually voiced out loud to anybody that I'm
considering voting Charlie out. It's a very hard decision, because not only has he been my number one
 since day three, but I have so much trust in him. Charlie is so lovable. He'll beat any of us. Charlie will win, hands down. Q:
 Yep. I honestly do. -Charlie don't win,
get rid of Charlie.
-Yep. -Which I'm down to do,
if you mean it.
-I'm down to do it, too. -CHARLIE: Hello! How's it going?
-Hello. MARIA:
 It's a very hard conversation to have, but it's also a reality. He's a threat. I knew why you picked
who you picked. -Thank you.
-It was just sad. And, I mean, I know... It was so sad,
'cause I know how badly you wanted
to read those letters. MARIA:
 I adore Charlie so much,
 and Charlie and I have walked this journey together
 with so much compassion and genuine care
for one another. And we've really formed,
like, a friendship that will go
way beyond this game. Just so, like,
grateful to, like, have you just
in my life, period. -Thank you for saying that.
-So... So just... I just really want
to thank you for everything. MARIA:
 So it's hard to switch
 from that security, that comfort
 and that camaraderie to ""It's my game now."" Like, it has to be my game. There aren't
 many options anymore for us to be a pair. Was there any strategy talk? Were there any pitches to you? There were. It was much of the same. -Which was...
-Like, ""Get Q out of the game."" Okay. CHARLIE:
 Maria's my number one ally. I love her to death,
but I've set up this blindside. I feel so many different emotions. And honestly,
it almost feels like guilt. It pulls on just every single fiber of me. MARIA:
 I think that
 was really important, -strategically,
is to keep... Yeah.
-Yeah. Keep them from, like, -talking to
too many people, and...
-Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. CHARLIE:
 I don't think Maria is considering blindsiding me. MARIA:
 I don't know. Would he ever do it to me? CHARLIE:
I was hoping
you-you would find it. MARIA:
Well, I tried to go look. I was like, ""I hope
that's what Maria gets to do -while I'm gone is,
like, find the idol.""
-I tried. I tried. It took me a while. Or did we really have plans
to go to the end together? Am I breaking his heart
and messing up our plans? I think she's dead serious about taking me to the final three. If anything, I feel like I got
a good friend out of this thing. -You know, whatever happens,
I feel like,
-Whatever happens, Maria. -Always.
-you're such a good person. MARIA:
 The two best buds, Malcolm and Denise,
can't go to the end, and I want Malcolm
to take this one. MARIA:
 Hopefully we get -to keep in touch
and be in each other's lives.
-Oh, my God, yeah. Oh, my God. I know it.
I literally know it. MARIA:
 At the end of the day, Charlie and I will be wonderful
friends after this game. -I want them
to meet Uncle Charlie.
-And, uh... Yes! Yes. MARIA:

Get here. Let's go. Charlie getting the base. Ben has the base.
Maria has the base. Hey... Liz has a piece. Mark it down. Kenzie's here now. Everybody on the puzzle now,

and you start to figure this out,
you can catch everybody quickly. It's now Ben in the lead,
then everybody else. Everybody now looking next door. ""What can I see

Ben is on a roll right now. He's figuring this puzzle out,

Ben's first challenge win. Couldn't come at a better time. But you never know. Any given challenge,
anyone can win. Maria with another piece. Now Ben's gonna

Maria now in the lead. Make it four in a row.

Maria's done it. Her third
individual immunity win, guaranteeing her
a spot in the final five. Wow. That went from competitive

individual immunity. You are guaranteed
a spot in the final five. We just talked about
the fact that this means you are in the finale. Why is that so significant
to a Survivor fan and player? You know, I think
yesterday I hit rock bottom, to not get that love from home. And so I thought to myself...
(sniffles) I was either
gonna be fueled by love or I was gonna be fueled by the fierce determination
that got me here. And so, this win, to me, is just proving to myself
that I have that determination, even in the absence
of love from home. Well done.

-CHARLIE: Challenge beast Maria. -I know.
-So fun, kids. KENZIE:
 Maria is the biggest
 threat out here. Maria can't keep
winning everything, but she does,
so it's frustrating. So we can't get her out. But I don't want
 to go any further with Q. LIZ: Yep, yep, yep. BEN: Yeah. Yeah. KENZIE:
 I have wanted Q out of my game for a hot minute now, and it's
 just not been happening. So I am ready
 to take down King Q. Like, I want him out of here. BEN: I think every time
has been the time to take out Q, but especially this time, 'cause
there's only two votes left. And the only reason
 Q keeps avoiding getting voted is 'cause Maria's convincing
 us all to use him as a number, which is really, ""Oh, they're an alliance. How did we
not put two and two together?"" We're, like,
the four court jesters taking down the king. -Yeah.
-Finally. BEN:
 Maria and Q think
 they've been running the show for a bit,
 but now everybody's trying to come together as one to take down the king and queen. This is gonna be my favorite
blindside of the season. Yeah, this one's really good. -Oh.
-What's the tea? So, thinking about this... Yeah. But... We have to. He's vulnerable now. We got to take the shot
when we can. It's Survivor. The safe move
is never the best move. Safe move
is never the best move. I know it's time
 to get out Charlie. But now, I'm removing my number one
and trusting in my number two. I know you're right, Q. I know he's a threat, and I knew
this day was gonna come. If everybody wants
 to bash me for taking Q further in this game,
that's their prerogative, but... it's Charlie tonight. So what are we gonna do? We got to go Charlie. Charlie? We got to stick together, Liz. I'm with you. Sounds good to me. Q comes up with this plan
 of getting Charlie out, but, Q, you know dang well I don't want to work with you. Ever since Maria and him
have teamed up and he thinks he's back on top, he's just been
 so ridiculously confident. KENZIE:
 But you know what? -I've been ready to get Q out.
-I've been ready
to get Q out, too. -For a long time.
-Yes. Tonight is finally the night
 Q is going home. See you later, brother. What are we gonna say to Maria? I'm just gonna play stupid. Yeah. What do
you all think about that? I mean, I'm fine with that. He is kind of the one to beat. -Everybody loves Charlie.
-Everybody... -Yeah, I love Charlie.
-If Charlie gets to the end,
he wins. -Hands down.
-Yeah. Like, look at him. -Everybody here,
he'll beat everybody.
-Yeah. Maria thinks Liz and I
 are gonna vote Charlie, but we're just
 bamboozling Maria and Q. I knew this day would come. -We both knew it would come,
you know?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. KENZIE:
 And I'm just eating it up,
 because Q feels comfortable. So Q is not gonna
see this blindside coming as long as
 Maria doesn't find out. CHARLIE:
 If we take out Q tonight
and leave Maria out of the vote, she's not gonna
be with us tomorrow. Yeah, it kind of weakens her, but if she wins immunity
tomorrow, which right now, -Looks possible.
-looks very possible, what happens to us? We have to make sure
that we can survive tomorrow. We need to get Q tonight, but we need to be careful
how we do it, because... if we leave Maria in the dark, then we go into final five. All of a sudden, Maria can
 team up with Liz and Kenzie and vote out either Ben or me. So the way I see it, we have to bring Maria
into the Q vote, which I think
she'd be cool with it. -Yeah.
-I'd have to talk to her, -but I think
that makes us the most safe.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 This is why I never close any door
on any relationship to work on.
'Cause guess what? -I just wanted to talk to you.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 Maria thinks I'm still
 her number one ally. That's the key of my game, is making sure that every side that I've been working with,
I can still work with. Yeah. Charlie approaches me and says, ""Tonight's the night
 we're gonna get rid of Q."" And so I nod and say,
 ""I think that's a good idea."" What I really feel is, ""Please don't look me
in the eye. I feel so embarrassed.
Don't look at me like that."" Um... I mean, what I really feel is, ""I think tonight
is Charlie's night to go."" Okay. So... You think we can get everyone
to write Q's name down? Yeah. MARIA:
 I think the conversation about getting rid of Q is really just
 to appease Charlie and to just distract him
 from any other thoughts. But in reality, Kenzie and Liz and Q and I are gonna be the ones
that make the decision. So there's nothing
 Charlie can do at this point. You feeling okay? Yeah.
I think you're fine. You may get a vote, but I don't think
you're going home. Q:
Thank you. -You'll be here tomorrow.
-Yep. Right now, I feel confident that I have Maria,
 Liz and Kenzie on board to working with me
to blindside Charlie. -You got a Q-skirt?
-I've got
a little pocket in my... Rock the Q-skirt! Q-skirt! Q-skirt! (Maria whoops) Q:
Q-skirt! Q-skirt! Yeah! After tonight's vote,
 and when Charlie goes home, it is safe to say that I've regained control. I don't see how it can go wrong, but here's what I know: the Q-skirt is holding an idol. Can you believe it? Nobody knows about the idol
 besides Maria, so this thing is powerful. And if I feel any spooks or dooks, I'm playing the idol for myself. Period. -Yeah. Yeah.
-All right, I just
want to make sure because... -Are we all good?
-Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. -I think we're all good
on the same page, right?
-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Yeah.
-Awesome. -All right. (whoops)
-Yeah. -Day 24. Day 25.
-Yeah. MARIA:
Tonight is a tough vote for me, because when
 I started this game, I said, ""I want to find my person."" And I found my person,
 and, like, Charlie's been my person,
 but I'm stepping forward. I'm not looking back. This is the right choice for me because at the end of this game,
only one of us can win. So it's going to be
 a sad Tribal Council for me. I'm going to see
 my best friend in this game walk out the door tonight,
 and so it's gonna be very bittersweet,
and I hope I get a hug. (chuckles) WH AT I S CI RK UL ? CI RK UL I S TH E FU EL Y OU N EE D TO T AK E FL IG HT . CI RK UL I S TH E EN ER GY T HA T GE TS Y OU T O TH E NE XT L EV EL .

Yo, yo, yo. Let's light it up. -Jeff, we have
a show for you tonight.
-(Liz vocalizing) Wow. (Liz vocalizing) Once again, I forgot popcorn. All right, let's start with
the reward challenge, Charlie, where you won the reward,
and much like Maria, you had a big decision to make. It was Chinese takeout. Jeff, it was the classic
bait and switch is what it was. I thought
it was Chinese takeout. And then you go,
""And loved one letters."" PROBST:
So I said,
""I'm gonna sweeten the deal and probably
complicate your decision."" Yeah, a little bit, you think? -I mean...
-So you seemed
to base it based on who had received an earlier reward. That seemed like a very
simple approach, but Maria was clearly emotionally upset
at missing out. Yeah, you know,
we talked about it and had some big, long hugs, and I was just impressed with all three of the people
who didn't go on the reward, who were just
very selfless in saying, ""No, you three go. You know, we'll-we'll
talk to our loved ones soon."" So, it just showed
how close we are out here. Even though everyone's thinking of their loved ones,
we're forming bonds here, too. PROBST:
Kenzie, what
was the love like for you? Because you shared
that you moved your wedding to come play Survivor. It's indescribable, like,
how much that meant to me. I told Charlie, like, ""This is a day that
I will never, ever forget."" Like, hearing from home
filled me up so much with just enough gas,
like, left in the tank to get me through
to the end of this game, because we are this really
weird, dysfunctional family, the six of us. Like, Q and Ben
are like my brothers who don't speak and they,
like, pick on me all the time. Maria's like our aunt
who cooks everything. You're like our cynical
grandma who's, like, losing it, -but we love her.
-(laughing) Charlie's like
our dependable dog. -Like...
-(laughing) KENZIE:
Like, we have made,
like, this family here, but it's not the same
as hearing from the people you love so much at home. PROBST:
All right, now let's talk
about the immunity challenge. Maria wins again, third time, which puts you just one shy
of an elite group of women who have won
four immunity challenges. -And that's in seasons
that have 39 days.
-Wow. PROBST:
But when I asked
you about today's win, you said it was the drive from not getting the love. Yeah. You know,
just to be super clear, like, there were no hard feelings
for Charlie's decision. Like, I knew exactly
why he chose who he chose, because they needed to eat. It doesn't mean that, like,
my heart wasn't broken. And then I went back to camp
and I cried the whole rest of the afternoon. But what I said to myself was, ""I either let this knock me down ""and take the wind
out of my sails ""or I'm gonna channel this into this fierce determination
to win the challenge today."" All right,
so you look at the jury. That's five blindsides.
They're essential in the game. It's the mark
of great Survivor gameplay, and you have to play that way. You cannot let the person
who's going home smell that they're going home, because there's so many ways
they could disrupt the game. But Charlie, when
it gets down to fewer numbers, does it get easier
to blindside or more difficult? CHARLIE:
I think, with fewer people, every vote matters so much more. People are thinking
about different criteria for who they're voting out. Are they good at challenges?
Are they good at making fire? Are they someone the whole
jury's going to vote for? You know, do you want them around camp
the last couple days? And since one vote
holds so much power, it's much more delicate, because if you tell the wrong person the wrong plan or the wrong name,
it is so easy for them to flip the game on its head. PROBST:
Maria, it's interesting to me, in that list of criteria,
""alliances"" was not mentioned. We've seen seasons
where alliances go all the way to the end,
and that's your final three. We've also seen seasons
where there's a point where people pivot and say,
""I got to make my move."" I mean, I think
alliances are important, but I think, like he said, it's
also important to think about who's still here tomorrow and who's going to be
on the jury. People are really starting to
think more about who could I sit next to, more so than, like,
are we sticking with alliances? Are alliances shifting? You know, it's-it's
really hard to know. Kenzie, that's
two people in a row that have basically said,
""I don't know about alliances."" I mean, I don't know
about alliances because, -not that Ben and I have been
in an ""alliance"" per se...
-(laughs) but he wrote my name down and told me,
""It was an accident."" -It really was.
-An accident. -Wait, hold up, listen.
-Have you ever heard that? -No.
-So I was drunk
off the pizza, right? -I can't wait to hear this.
-BEN: We had... -There wasn't even
alcohol there.
-We-we had, like, -six pizzas.
-PROBST: To be clear, -you had soda. Yeah.
-BEN: No alcohol. Yeah.
-KENZIE: Yeah. I also know how to spell Venus. It's a planet, Ben.
It doesn't start with K. -It's okay. It's okay.
-I'm just saying, if we're
gonna talk about alliances, I think it's
kind of a wash after that. -(laughs)
-PROBST: I got to say, Ben, -I watch a lot of police
interrogation videos,
-BEN: Yeah. and if I'm imagining you
in that room with the camera, and you say,
""I was drunk on pizza,"" -I don't think you're
getting out of that room.
-(laughing) -Oh, definitely not, Jeff.
-I still held his hand after
he wrote my name down, but... She's like my Survivor sister,
so if anything, this is just
some teasing, hopefully. Hopef... Q, what's your take
on alliances? Because Charlie didn't
mention them and Maria said, ""Look, maybe,
but there's only six of us, and we're trying
to get to the end."" Does that mean
that maybe alliances are over unless they're convenient? I wouldn't say it's over, Jeff. I think it's plans in place
with a group of people that see for this vote,
it makes sense. For next vote,
it might not make sense, but I understand that a vote will be made tonight
based off a group that agreed. PROBST:
How about you, Liz?
Agree with that? Yeah. Everyone, since the Hunter
vote, has voted together. And so, maybe I'm naive. I mean, I think
there are more power couples that are together than,
like, true alliances. But we're all thinking about
that final Tribal Council. And based on Charlie's criteria, I'm not gonna win
any immunity challenge, I'm terrible at fire,
and I'm not in an alliance. So... Don't vote for me. (laughs) Charlie, it's interesting
hearing Liz say, ""The last few votes
have been a group of people voting together,
except for the one."" Sooner or later, you're the one. Yeah.
Lightning's gonna strike. And we're all sitting here, and tonight we might get--
(buzzes)-- zapped. And, um... This is a group of hardened Survivor players now. This isn't day one Survivor. So, everyone's getting
freaking good at this game. So it's hard to tell

 and I'm a game changer and I'm going to change
the way this game is played. BEN:
Here we go. KENZIE:
Who we missing? -(indistinct chatter)
-What? KENZIE: So we're all expecting
Venus to be gone, and then guess who waltzes
her beautiful self in? TIFFANY:
Oh, my God. KENZIE: Venus' name has been
 brought up multiple times. No one really enjoys working
with her, no one trusts her. -You want to get into it?
-TIFFANY: Yes. Absolutely. KENZIE:
Yeah, let's hear it. Yeah. Tiff and I make eyes
 at each other like, ""They didn't do it.
They didn't get her."" -You want to hear the tea.
-KENZIE: Yeah. Well, surprise, surprise.
Two votes against Venus. -Q: Two votes against Venus.
-TIFFANY: Who voted for you? Tevin and Soda. -KENZIE: Oh.
-Q: Ooh.
-TIFFANY: Ooh. ...let's just say a man
who claims his entire identity in this game
is surrounded by honesty and being an honest person straight-up lied to my face
the entire day and wrote my name down. And I saw through that and, you know, karma
bit them in the ass. It was four against Soda,
and she went home. -Mm-hmm.
-Q: Damn.
-TIFFANY: I feel bad. No, Soda took it real well.
She gave me a big hug. She was like, ""You got me.""
I was like, ""Yeah, I did."" Then we're like... (laughs) I'm so sorry. (laughs) Venus has taken the accolades, trying to commandeer the fact that Soda's going home
 was her doing. TIFFANY:
Spicy legs. It was just like... -(indistinct chatter) -TIFFANY:
Yeah, we were just, like... TEVIN:
 I voted for Venus
 because I didn't know if Soda had an idol, I didn't
 know if Venus had an idol, and so that I could say, ""Soda, I didn't vote for you. ""I told you I'd never write
your name down in the game, and I didn't.
I wrote Venus'."" But I don't need credit. I'll explain my game
 when I get to the final three. So right now,
 I'm letting Venus be cocky because, Venus, you may not
 understand right now, but you will very soon when your torch is snuffed
and you're going home. Ugh! Look, I thought
I was a cocky bitch. She was a poison copperhead. Well, she thinks
it was her idea. -She thinks the idea
was her plan...
-And I told you, my first opportunity,
I was writing Soda. That wasn't, like,
an original idea. But it worked,
which is what I wanted. -It did.
-Went to Maria and Charlie and they voted with us,
so that's good. LIZ:
 Oh, my gosh. Venus thinks she's a genius. Oh, wow.
 Tevin made a big move. Ever since I met all of you, I've been saying,
""Hey, Soda, Soda, Soda."" And honestly,
 they're taking all the credit. And for someone like me,
 who has a giant ego, it is so hard for me to give them both the play. Well, I'll let it lie
till we get her out. Right. LIZ:
 I don't want to get lost in the shuffle of things. So, I have to stop hesitating and I have
 to start taking action or the action
is gonna be taken on me. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (laughing) You were a lot more quiet
when you were hungry. I was hungry as hell, man,
I was saying nothing. I got some ideas
flowing in this head of mine... -And look.
-(Kenzie laughs) So the Q Skirt is essentially a hoodie flipped backwards like a pouch of a kangaroo with two pockets.
 It's gonna be the next big thing. I even said, for a man, if you don't want
to wear no drawers, you just want to wear these,
you good. For a woman,
you don't want to carry a purse when you go to the amusement
parks or a fanny pack, you don't want that anymore, -you want a little more swag...
-Mm. ...get the Q Skirt. -Mm! Come on.
-If you just want fashion, want to rip the runway
in something different, -and want to turn it
to the side...
-Uh-huh. get the Q Skirt. -Oh, come on, now!
-And it's coming
in multiple colors. This Q Skirt here will cost less
than a fanny pack, an extra bag,
a sweater, a blanket. -TEVIN: All together,
-All together. -Oh, dear.
-It's a one-in-one,
and it's one for you. -Buy three, get one free.
-HUNTER: Oh, goodness. TEVIN:
 I don't think it's worth a damn, but I think just because of his conviction,
I want one. I'm convinced.
I want a Q Skirt. There we go. I'm definitely doing a Q Skirt
when I get home. -If you a guy...
-Yup. you just want a little swag, but you don't want
to carry a bag, -you get the Q Skirt.
-CHARLIE: Yup. -Why?
-Will you buy a Q Skirt?
Yes or no? -Sign me up.
-(laughing) CHARLIE:
 Q is just a really funny guy and someone
 who I am doing my best to stay on his good side because I've learned now that Q isn't just driving votes. He's putting together alliances and groups of people he wants
at the very end of the game. So, this morning, I have perhaps my most important conversation
 of the game. Man, I tell you, if you ever are playing Survivor, get up at sunrise. Every single major conversation I've had in this game
has happened at the sunrise, when everyone's asleep
 in the shelter. That's where the moves are made. Yeah. -I'm freaking itching.
-Well, Charlie... I'm itching
to play the game, man. -Let's friggin' do it.
-Let's do it then, man. Let's go. Let's go. And as we're talking,
 I realize, this is an interview
 for an alliance. So I'm thinking, I want to get hired
for this position. You know, I want the job. Maria is going
to approach you... Mm-hmm. ...about joining
a bigger alliance. -Yeah.
-This is the first step of me saying, -""Charlie, I want
to work with you.""
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-We're trying to get a six. Okay. This is the first time
 that I'm hearing of the six. I knew Q had some master plans, but I was never in, you know, the C suite. I told you, I got
your best interest at heart. Yeah. So I've been, uh, trying
to plant the seed for you to join this alliance
for a long time. -I told you, man. I told you.
-Maria. You got my back. CHARLIE:
 So this mystical, powerful six
that Q has thrown together is made up of two Nami--
 Tevin and Hunter, two Yanu-- Q and Tiffany, two Siga-- Maria and myself, the newest recruit. We got to talk, though, 'cause, like,
this game is getting crazy. I love the six,
but the six isn't impenetrable. The six is probably
the... shakiest six -that's ever existed,
because guess what?
-Mm-hmm. Tim was in the six. Maria seems pretty gung ho
 on the six. She sees it as a guaranteed way to get to the final six, and I see it as a way
that I might get stuck with a bunch of people
I can't beat at the end. Only thing
we got to be careful of and watch
is Charlie getting smart and trying to make a move. -Mm-hmm.
-Look, I just don't think Charlie has it to try to turn. -You know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm. -He don't have
that killer instinct.
-No. CHARLIE:
We're not the first group of six in Survivor history to say, ""Let's get to the final six
together, then duke it out."" Something always goes awry. And I have to decide am I what goes awry? (M an ) Ex cu se m e, would you mind taking a picture

We can play hide-and-seek. Hide-and-seek
would be so fun right now. TIFFANY: Q decides that he wants to play hide-and-seek,
which is no surprise, because Q has been trying
 to play hide-and-seek since we were at Yanu camp. We got enough people now,
and we all full. Oh, my God. Fine. -Y'all want to play?
-BEN: I'm in. -We better play hide-and-seek.
-Q: Hell, yeah.
-Yeah. TIFFANY:
 And I think
 it's hilarious, because here we are,
these grown-ass adults competing with each other
 for a million dollars. And we're like, ""Let's play
hide-and-seek, y'all."" Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a tiger by his toe. My mama told me to... I really am a kid. I really
enjoy playing hide-and-seek. But I'm gonna use this
 as part of my gameplay. But everyone else,
it's just fun. Ma. Yeah. -I'm it?
-You're it. I'm not playing around.
I'm gonna find you all. Q, I'm coming for you. Q:
I don't think anyone thinks that this was a gameplay move more than ""Q wanted to have fun and be Q"" move. I'm at the boat!
I'm counting to 40! -Okay, let's go.
-Okay. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ Q:
 What this game
 is gonna represent for me is who can hide in plain sight the best. CHARLIE:
...thirty, 31, 32, thirty-three. Survivor is a tense game, and it's nice to just loosen up. You know, sometimes
you just got to forget the strategy
 and play a silly little game. ...thirty-eight, 39. 40! Ready or not, here I come! -I did not see you at first.
-I know. I... CHARLIE:
Wow. People are not half-assing
 this hide-and-seek game. They are diving
 in the tall grass, covering themselves
 with palm fronds, going deeper into the jungle than anyone has ever gone
in this game. (sing-songy):
Venus! -LIZ: No. No.
-CHARLIE: Two down. Two down. How did you see me? CHARLIE:
I saw your hood.
That was good, though. This group of ten
is competitive as hell. Whitney Houston. Oh, my gosh. VENUS:
Honestly, Tevin,
I did not see you. -Yeah.
-I almost walked right by you. -(laughing)
-CHARLIE: That's intense. TEVIN (loudly):
Ah! VENUS: Even though it's, like,
 a silly, stupid game of hide-and-seek, and it's meant to be, like, fun and bonding,
 it still reveals a lot about people's
personality traits and their underlying talents. Tiffany in the grass! -TEVIN: Oh!
-CHARLIE: Let's go. VENUS:
 Tiffany-- the fact
 that she hid with a red Buff on her head-
 that just tells me that she's a little sloppy
and may not know to hide those little details. -CHARLIE: Dang, bro.
-TEVIN: Oh, Q over there. -No way. You got Q?
-Where? I'm so proud of myself.
I found someone. CHARLIE:
Good for you. Q:
 It was only Liz who actually walked
 in the woods to see me. Bad idea, Liz. 'Cause now I know that you are playing the game,
 you are paying attention, and you do want to win,

 Next, we find Kenzie, someone in this game

 she can go undetected. This was a good idea, Q.

-KENZIE: Maria! This one here! (chuckles) I got some camouflage. VENUS: Maria-- super creative.
 Like, she put a little headdress on
 for herself, she blended in. That says to me that
she's someone who works well with her surroundings
and is really adaptable. -If you had a sniper,
we'd be gone.
-(laughs) We need
to step our game up here. We have 60 seconds. A mad dash,
or else Hunter and Ben win, and that would suck. TEVIN:
Split up. 60 seconds. -Hunter's somewhere stupid.

Oh, my God.
I can only hear him. -Oh, I see him.
-Damn, Ben! -BEN: Let's go!

of playing an undercover game, but be very powerful at the end. (whoops) Ben made a mistake. Hunter, you win! -We're done looking!

 Hunter made a mistake. If I can't find you

of what happened last night. ...I feel like feelings ran hot
on both sides. -My feelings weren't hot.
-You were sad. Yeah. -And I think...
-Thank you for respecting it. Yeah. Yeah. VENUS:
 I was a little uncertain how that Soda vote
would be read, because in my mind,
 it really was my vote. I put in the groundwork to get
 all the necessary votes in to lock that down
 and make it solid, and now, I'm kind of the first person
to pull off a blindside. -You want to know
how I pulled it off?
-Yeah. I never even wanted
to write Soda's name down. I had a conversation
first thing that morning where she'd said that she's not
gonna work for me long-term, and I knew
she was gonna come for me, so, I... I pulled the numbers
as soon as I could. -Damn, that's good.
-I know. And that's... -My God, today.
-My God, today. (laughs) And in terms
 of damage control with Tevin, I found it
 to be very important for me to air out some of our laundry and to actually open up a line
of communication with Tevin. Can I ask you, now that
we've gotten it out of the way? Like, I don't think
I've heard you talk, like, strategy-wise,
like, what you see for the next phase of the game. -I'm moment to moment.
-You're moment to moment. Yes, I understand that,
but, also, like, Soda was the same way,
and I guess in this game, like, just, like, for advice,
is that you need to sometimes show a little bit
of, like... commitment in a direction. But I think, for at least
this next short while, -we would benefit each other
by being more open.
-Mm-hmm. VENUS:
 Tevin's kind of like
 a fish out of water in terms of the strategy portion
of this game. Like, sure,
 he's a social butterfly, but I don't think
he really knows what's going on. Like, he seemed very impressed
 that I was able to pull that move on him,
 but to me, it was like, ""How could you not see it coming
in the first place, Tevin? Like, come on."" (high-pitched laugh) LIZ:
Oh, whoa. That's a new laugh. (Tevin laughs deeply) She thinks, honest to God, she has pulled off the move that I planned for her. LIZ:
 These two are running around. Venus: ""It's my idea.""
Tevin: ""Actually, it was mine. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."" (deep, loud laughing) Shut up. (laughs)
I'm about to pee. LIZ:
 I love Tevin, but I know now people are seeing him
as the mastermind? She said to me, ""Thank you
for respecting my move."" LIZ:
 He navigated the Soda vote without Soda even knowing. So now, I need to give a signal to the other Tribemates that I'm here to play, too. I love this game. LIZ:
 I'm sorry, Tevin, but you got to go. I know everybody's playing Survivor hard-core right now, but, like,
sometimes you got to, like, pause the game for,
like, three minutes. And hear me out. What has she actually done to make you feel
threatened by her besides mentioning your name
to people -that aren't even
taking her seriously?
-Right. -Who cares?
-Right. -Let her stick around.
That's just another body.
-Right. TIFFANY:
 Venus thinks
 she's a power player, but she's really not.
 I wanted her out bad, but I think I'd rather deal
 with a nuisance than a threat. So I'm trying to shift
my focus now because... the point in the game where you're just getting out
obvious targets is done. That's the thing.
I don't know who's next. -That's right.
-That's the only thing. You got to wait and see how the
immunity challenge shakes out and see what the options are. TEVIN:
 Tiffany is in my alliance. However, Tiffany's
 getting shaky. She wants to keep Venus around. So, Tiffany is not lining up
with what the six wants, and what the six wants is
six to stay strong. Tiffany says
Venus ain't a threat. I know what you're saying. I said, ""Tiffany,
who you want to go instead of Venus then, if you
don't want to get Venus out?"" She said, ""Well, let's just
see what happens ""in the immunity challenge
and let's just see who's left and figure it out from there."" Q:
Mm-hmm. Up until this point,
 Tiff has been my number one ally in this game. But Tiff is trying
 to keep members in this game that are not part of the six,
 like Venus, because she's playing the old Survivor-- take a goat to the end. That's not the game
that I want to play. In this game,
 you have to play a Q game. If you don't play my game
 and you want to go off and do your own thing,
 then you're probably not going to last in this game
 a lot longer. And if we feel like Tiff's not
gonna play get in the six, then maybe Tiff's gonna lose,
be sent home. I'm fine with that. Mm-hmm. Q:
 So, I need to confirm that our games are going in two
different directions, and if so, then Tiff might be the next vote
 if she doesn't win. For me, if I had to...
if I had to throw out names for who I want to go next,
it would either be Maria, Ben. Ben is sneaky,
but he's not as smart as Maria. And it just comes down
to that for me. Q:
Tiff has made multiple mistakes. She's trying to keep goats. And now Tiff brought up
 Maria's name. She's in the six, Tiff.
Big mistake. Right now, the six is just permission for Q to fire. If you bring up a name
 within the six, now you've given me ammunition
 to take you out without any recourse. -From Tiff?
-Yeah. She's making me super nervous. And-and she-she's really
about keeping Venus. Yeah. Tiff said my name,
 and so, if someone in our alliance is putting up
someone else's name in the alliance,
they've got to go. -which is?
-You can't repeat this. Tiff has an idol. MARIA:
Q told me that Tiff has an idol. I am actually really surprised
 that Q would tell me, that that makes me trust Q even more. So who's our target? So, let's go for Tiff. Got it. MARIA:
 Q's game is all about trust. He does not want
to feel anybody wavering at all. And so, if you show him
that you're trustworthy, he's gonna work with you. The minute you start
 looking shady, you're out. And so, we may have an alliance of five instead of
an alliance of six. Yes. Right now, this is
 the biggest move yet for me, to now turn on my number one
 ally in the game. -Mm-hmm.
-TEVIN: Mm-hmm. Q:
The ideal is to keep my alliance making decisions
 that I want them to make, under my control, under my rule. It's almost like I'm a mob boss. And they dare not to say a name
within my organization. And if they do,
send 'em packing. I send 'em a Q Skirt, though. EG O, T HE N UM BE R ON E RA TE D BR AN D IN C OR DL ES S OU TD OO R PO WE R BR IN GS Y OU T HE SE LE CT C UT M OW ER .

-PROBST: First things first. Ladies, got to take back
the necklaces. No! -Here, you take it.
-All right. KENZIE:
Thanks, Jeff. Thank you, Maria. All right, once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
it is a Survivor classic and one I never
get tired of seeing. You're gonna hold onto a pole... for as long as you can. -(laughing)
-When you drop... ...you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed -a spot in the final nine.
-Wow. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the ninth person
voted out and become the second member
of our jury. Little something else
to deal with today. -I knew it. I knew it.
-How fun. PROBST:
In this new era of Survivor, you start with very little,
including no food. And then at a certain point in
the game, you're given a chance to earn some food. That day is today. -TIFFANY: Oh, my God.
-(whooping) -That's a heavy bag.
-Oh, yes. PROBST:
Enough rice to last you
to the end of the season. -Wow.
-TEVIN: Oh, wow. Here's what it will cost you. Four players... have to agree
to sit out of this challenge, give up your shot at immunity in exchange for the rice. -And four is the max?
-Minimum. -The minimum?
The minimum, right?
-PROBST: Four is it. MARIA: Are you willing
to negotiate, Jeff? -We can't do three?
-No. Four is the set number. No negotiating, Jeff? PROBST:
I'll give you an option. Four of you can agree
to sit out, or two of you can agree... to give up your vote
at tonight's Tribal Council and still compete and still have a shot
at immunity. I'm gonna say, ""Hell, no.""
(laughs) Well, it really comes down
to the same thing. Where does everybody feel
they sit in the game? How comfortable are you
with your alliance? PROBST: Talk about it. Is anyone thinking immediately, -""I'm sitting out for this?""
-No one want to sit out? -Nope.
-No. Wow. Nobody. So before we even go further, Charlie, what does that say
about where Survivor 46 is? Everyone out here
is a competitor. We played hide-and-seek -for nothing.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
Not for immunity, not for any advantage,
and people were diving into tall grass. You know, Hunter climbed
20 feet up in a tree. You know, these people are here
to compete. And when you give us this, which is one
of the Survivor classics, -nobody wants to sit out.
-Yeah. I'll be one. PROBST:
Okay. -I haven't eaten.
-Okay, so we've got two. Liz says ""I'll sit out.""
Q is volunteering to sit out. We just need two more and this rice is yours. If we give you
an immediate third, -would you give us the rice?
-No. It's four.
Four is not even half. That's fair in this game.
Venus, you're shaking your head ""no,""
which I understand. Explain why. VENUS:
Only one person
will win this challenge, and I have a very good feeling
that that person could be me, so I don't want to step out. Is there anyone who'd step out,
like, in a pair, two at once? -They just don't...
-Are you willing to step out? If there's someone who's willing
to jump out with me, -I'd consider it.
-I mean, stepping out now
don't commit us to doing it.
If you step out, and no one else is doing it,
he counts down, and we just all do it, you know,
so if you want to step out, -step out.
-LIZ: Right, and then,
we still play. I don't know.
I want to play it, though. Let's make it interesting.
You keep talking. I'll just quietly count. Ten. -Oh, wow.
-Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. -Five.
-I don't think
anyone wants to step out. Four. Three. Two. One. We don't have a deal. First time in the new era
we could not come to a deal. Liz, you can step back. Y'all, I'm fitting to win this. -Yeah. You deserve it.
-PROBST: It tells me everybody here is playing, this game is fully cooked. -LIZ: Wow.

That was a bad decision, man. Now we have to go out

 It is time to send Tiff to the jury because she broke my rule. If you target
 anybody within the six, you go home. We talked about it
a little bit earlier. You still want the same plan or
you want to do something else? We already knew what was up. We already said,
""Hey, if Tiffany doesn't win immunity today, she's gone."" She's messing
 with the six alliance. Therefore, she got to go. Okay. We got three right now.
I know... TEVIN:
Maria would go for it.
Charlie would go for it. You think Liz would go for that? -Yeah.
-That's all we need. TEVIN:
 In addition to the plus-one
 alliance, I believe that Liz would vote with us, as she has
 in the past Tribal Councils. So, if this plan goes down, Tiffany will be blindsided
tonight. How's it going over here? All I know is I'm thinking... ""Liz... ""...do you just want

I'm gone tonight. -MARIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. I want Tevin gone. I love Tevin.
We've been number ones, but he made
a really big move with Soda. Do you think that he's the most
logical threat right now? LIZ:
Yes. I, personally,
I would like Tevin out. I want to blindside Tevin. I've realized who Liz is,
and Liz is a fighter. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Let me just be real with you. I'm looking back at the last
 15 days, laughing at myself at how many times
 I let someone else take the lead, and... I'm done with that. It's got to be Tevin tonight. -Okay. -Thank God. Finally, people have
come to their senses and have realized
how big of a threat Tevin is. From what I'm hearing... Okay. And I think if we all,
maybe, work together -and try to get Tevin...
-Okay. we could probably
form a comfortable, maybe, chill alliance
for a vote or two. -Okay. -Tevin's got the social charisma like I've never seen. He's so likable.
 In real life, amazing. In a game where we're
competing for a million dollars, got to go. Game time, brother. Also, the Yanu three has been driving
so many votes in this game, and right now, I don't want to be leading all of the votes
to put a bigger target on Yanu. -Liz... Liz wants...
-We got to vote for Tevin. -Liz is on board.
-Ben just told me
the same thing. -Okay, good. We're voting Tevin.
-... yes. But if it gets back to Tevin, -it's gonna be...
That's how easy.
-And that's why... and as... But, also, he has an extra vote, so he could flip that
on any of us. KENZIE:
Yeah. TIFFANY:
 Tevin is a huge threat. Also, Tevin has
 an extra vote in his pocket. And the deeper we get
into the game, the more power that extra vote
is gonna have. What's up with you? But right now, Q and I have
 a great working relationship. We share information freely. I absolutely
 cannot leave him out of a vote at this point in time. Everybody who I spoke
to today is saying Tevin. -Everybody.
-Who? Liz the one who brought
Tevin name up to me. And she said that she spoke
to Charlie, Ben and Maria, and they was with it. She was like, ""Listen..."" Well, I'm gonna
tell you right now, if you don't vote Tevin,
people gonna be looking at you next.
You better get on board. Q:
 The idea of a plan being changed last-minute doesn't really sit well with me. Tiff was telling me
about the plan. -Yeah.
-Is that real coming from you, -or is that just talk?
-Yes. You talking about T? -Yeah. Yeah.
-That's real? I feel like just about
everybody's on board. Q:
 I'm not the driver
 in the Tevin vote. And my game is based off
 me being in control. So I wanted
 to gain control again. Everybody you think is working with us have flipped. Tevin is the one
that's going home tonight. -They're voting for Tevin?
-All of 'em. -Every single person
in this camp.
-Okay. We can't stop it. So there's no need
to even bring it up, -because then they gonna
know I said something.
-Uh-huh. -You see what I'm saying?
-Mm-hmm. I ain't trying to ... my game
over trying to save one person. -Mm-hmm.
-But I know
if we write Tiff name down, -she's gonna be here tomorrow.
She's not going home.
-Okay. Hunter... HUNTER:
 Q says it's actually Tevin, and we don't
 have the numbers anymore, but it just seems
so off the wall for me. Tevin's good
 for all of our games, and we made an alliance
 based off of Andy Griffith. (whistling a tune) HUNTER:
 I want to keep Tevin here. And so it's like, I've got to go and do this damage control and get ahead
of what's going on, so it doesn't just
completely destroy my game. Q:
 Hunter walks right past me
 to go to talk to other people. And I'm like,
 ""Oh, man, this guy, he's doing exactly what
I did not want him to do,"" especially moments before going to Tribal. Venus, can we
talk to them real fast? Can we chat
with them real quick? -Oh, without me there?
-Yes. Q:
 I made a mistake,
 and now this plan is all screwed up. I should have
kept my mouth shut. The reason we targeted
Tiff is because she, like, went after Maria. Tevin never did that. I guess the decision is,
are we fine with Tevin leaving right now? He trusts us so much
that the guy's just sitting back there
thinking it's all fine. (whistling) -Y'all... I mean...
-CHARLIE: No, no, I-I hear you. I hear you. I'm thinking. Anticipating chaos. VENUS:
For the first time in my life. I've never seen that man
run to someone and talk trash. Oh, he just...
Now he's gesturing over here.
 Now he's gesturing -over here again.
-KENZIE: So, we still have the numbers, right? -Yeah.
-Definitely. VENUS:
 The plan is Tevin. There's peace in the castle.
The kingdom is calm. But now all I see is
this conversation on the beach, and my radar is going off. Something's afoot. All right, bro. There are no rules.
I can go sit there. Hi. What's up? LIZ:
Venus, I love you. I'm really sorry.
I have to talk to them. I know that's gonna
piss you off. I'm sorry,
but y'all also realize the sun is setting,
and we all have talks. So, like, can y'all wrap it up
in the next few minutes? -Yes.
-Sure.
-Thank you. CHARLIE:
Yes. (laughs) Charlie, I want to know
what you think. -You seem really upset.
-CHARLIE: I'm not upset. No. I'm just feeling, like,
all the whiplash of today. -It's, like...
-So then you guys
want to go back to Tiff? Like, is that
what you would prefer, or... -Listen, I'll do whatever
y'all want, at this point.
-Yeah. I know, but we got
to come together as a whole. I would rather keep
the original and go Tiff. LIZ:
Y'all do whatever you want.
I'm voting Tevin. CHARLIE:
 I have no freaking clue what's gonna happen because of this chaos
that's been whipped up at the 11th hour. -So, so...
-I don't know what the heck's... CHARLIE:
 Half of the tribe
 wants to get out Tiff. The other half wants
 to get Tevin out of the game. And, at this point,
 Maria and I are at another crossroads. In my eyes, Tevin
is the better option than Tiff. Tevin orchestrated
 the Soda blindside, but this threadbare alliance of six is thinking
 about voting out Tiff because Tiff threw out
 the name Maria. And, ultimately,
 Maria's my number one. This alliance has zero legs.
 It's going nowhere. It's the loosest use of the word
 ""alliance"" that has ever existed,
 but, once again, Maria and I have to commit and we have to make a decision. [ Ce ll ph on e ri ng in g ] Ph on e ca ll f ro m th e bo ss ? So rr y. Outdoor time is me time. Sticking it to the boss,

I guess we got to start with the rice negotiation. It's 16 days
with very little food. Q, you tried. You were the first to say,
""I'll volunteer."" Wisely so, 'cause you were
first out of the challenge. Has there been
any discussion about that? I had a bit of a temper tantrum
back at camp, after. I was still upset and mad. I mean, I think five people
were out within two minutes, and there was only gonna be one
winner and one loser tonight. So everyone suffered
when I think the odds were in their favor to feed
everybody for another nine days. Liz, another thing
that is very difficult to try to understand
until you're here is what hunger after 16 days
feels like. Are you surprised that the group couldn't make a deal? I was surprised that Q sat out. I thought I was gonna
be the only one to step up because I can't eat coconut,
I can't eat papaya. Even some of the rewards I have barely been able to eat. I haven't even
gone to the restroom yet. Oh. PROBST:
Tiff, is the rice negotiation just an indicator
of where this game is? TIFFANY:
Oh, absolutely. Nobody feels safe enough
to step out. Everybody feels like they need
to compete for immunity, and that was blatantly obvious. They said food is not
as important as safety. But, Jeff, I want to stop before we get deep into the Tribal. The only person that's
going home tonight is me. And I'll tell you why. Wait, wait, w... You mean
you're predicting your vote out? Yeah. Well,
I don't think anyone here coming into the Tribal Council
was voting for me, but I'm gonna ask
everybody to vote for me. Then all of these nine folks
are going back to camp today. I feel like... -Let me
just interrupt real quick.
-Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. -(groans)
-PROBST: Is this news
to everyone? -Yeah. What is going on?
-What the hell?
-Totally. Q, what are you talking about? So if someone goes home tonight, and it wasn't the right way,
because, like I say, there's probably
five people here right now who are like,
""Who the heck am I voting for?"" because of mistakes
that I made in the game. And I want everybody to start
just playing the game hard. You have a new beginning. -Kenzie, it's clear
what he's saying, right?
-Yeah. To everyone. He is saying,
""Vote me out."" Is that clear to everyone? -It's clear, but, like, what?
-Yeah, it's clear,
but it doesn't... -TIFFANY: But it
doesn't make sense.
-But I don't understand why. TEVIN:
The math isn't math-ing,
because I've talked to Q, and I know that Q is here
and he wants to play the game. And I guess it's just
kind of out of the blue, and it's just very unexpected. It's not something
that was even hinted towards. -I mean, it is
completely off-brand.
-KENZIE: Yeah. And yet, Ben, we just talked
about how competitive. It's so competitive, you wouldn't give up
your shot at immunity for rice. And here's somebody saying,
""Guess what? Merry Christmas."" You know, Q and I did not
get off to a great start, but everybody knows
he's been playing hard and in a genuine way. So it's like this... th... Even me, who's been, like, kind of skirting around him, is like, ""Uh, what?"" This is actually,
like, probably the most bonkers thing
I would have expected tonight. (whispering indistinctly) PROBST:
Tiff. I'm very confused, Jeff. I don't know where
this is coming from because I've known Q since I got here,
and Q's a competitor. So this is completely, like,
coming out of left field for me. It's-it's not me giving up.
Trust me. I want to play, and I've been
playing since day one. But again, when something don't sit right with me and I feel partially
responsible for it, I got to own up to it and say,
""You know what? I'm not gonna steal
someone else's joy and dream,"" especially in this game, where
you only get an opportunity to potentially play once. -And...
-I think you can own up to it, person to person,
without leaving the game. -And I don't think
anyone wants you to go.
-(overlapping agreement) -Yeah.
-And I-I know y'all don't, but someone is going
to get voted out because of last-minute
things that happened, and I feel partially
responsible for it. And I'm big enough
to say that I want you guys to go on and play.
I'm serious about this, now. I want y'all to go on and play, but start playing the game. 'Cause everybody
have a new opportunity. PROBST:
So, Kenzie, on one side, Q's volunteering, which means
nobody else here is going home. On the other side, Q is a vote,
and he's probably in an alliance with one or two or three
or who knows how many people. So that also
will impact the game. KENZIE:
Yeah. Q's saying,
""Go ahead. Fresh start."" What if you were a part
of my plans five plans from now? That's not a fresh start for me. That's undoing the plans
that I've been building. Like, it's gonna be
wacky no matter what. Like, it's not, like,
we're gonna go back to camp and be like,

46,13,Friends Going to War,"Welcome to the season finale
of Survivor 46. Well, it's been a fun and unpredictable season
of Survivor. We've had a lot
of strong players taken out-- including six straight
blindsides-- forming our jury. We've had five players voted
out with idols in their pocket, including
the last four in a row. That's a record. And to date, it's been 23 days
they've gone without rice. Also a record. But now we're down to five. Tonight we'll have
two immunity challenges, two Tribal Councils,
one fire-making showdown. And then our final three
will face the jury and we will crown a winner
of Survivor 46. We'll then immediately
go into the aftershow while we're still here
in beautiful Fiji and talk about it all. All right, our final five: Charlie, Maria, Ben, Liz and Kenzie. Who will be
this season's Sole Survivor and take home the check
for a million dollars? This is it. Season finale, Survivor 46. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. (laughing quietly) And behold. PROBST:

-Oh, my God, yeah. MARIA:
 I adore Charlie so much, but right now, -he's standing in my way. -CHARLIE: I am just so grateful to, like,
have you just in my life. I love her to death, but if I'm going to play to win, I have to vote her out. PROBST:
Maria down to her last piece. And there it is. Maria's done it.
Her third individual immunity win. BEN:
 Now everybody's trying
 to come together to take down the king and queen. -LIZ: Yeah, I love Charlie.
-Yeah. Maria thinks Liz and I
 are gonna vote Charlie. -I knew this day would come.
-KENZIE: Yeah. But we're just bamboozling
 Maria and Q. All right. Tonight is Charlie's
 night to go, and I hope I get a hug. PROBST:

Where you want to go? MARIA:
 Oh, my God. I messed up.
I messed up tonight. I tried to take out Charlie, my closest ally. But my big move didn't pan out. And, yeah, I have to do, like, major damage control. -Yeah.
-...to tell me that
if I sat next to you at the end, I was never gonna win. They pitted me against you
and did a bait and switch and made me vote for you
so I look like an idiot, and now Q's gone. I'm, like, nauseated just trying
 to explain myself to Charlie, and I'm really worried my best friend in the game
is never gonna forgive me, and my game is done. -That threesome
-Mm-hmm. -that's up there
 is out to get us.
 -Yeah. -MARIA: They messed up
 the alliance
 -Like... -No, no.
-I trusted the most
and now it's tainted. You know what? There's no reason
to call the party off. I still want to party, okay? Because we're down
to five people, and guess what? -We just got to think
how we're gonna play this.
-Okay. CHARLIE:
 Final five by the skin of my teeth. Ooh! Maria, my number one ally, came for my throat. You know, it'd be easy for me
 to be bitter and upset, but let's be real.
If she didn't win immunity, I was planning
on doing the same thing. I'm sorry.
God, I screwed up. -God.
-What the heck, Maria? -Man.
-What the heck? I'm sorry. CHARLIE:
 Maria feels terrible,
she feels bamboozled, but it's completely fake. I know it. She came for me
and I came out on top. -(laughs)
-I totally screwed up. -Damn. -CHARLIE: But if one thing
came out of tonight, it's that I'm a big threat, and people are willing
 to write my name down. So, I have to keep every path
 open, keep every option open, to get to the end and go for the win,
go for the million. -We made final five.
-CHARLIE: Honestly, -that was a great Tribal.
-KENZIE: That was a great... And, Liz, you finally
got your wish to vote Q off. -Mm-hmm.

that was just Liz's wish? -Oh, no, I doubt that.
-And that's what's up. (laughing) Q, my darling, you got played. I'm so excited! That was honestly
a really good move, guys. Y'all are playing way harder
than I thought. Yeah, we could have
told you that, but we didn't. MARIA:
Yeah, I know. LIZ:
 Maria says she finally sees that we are
 actually playing the game. Just a face.
I don't even have words. Just a face for that. But at this point in the game, Maria has a giant target
 on her back. Q ruined my game tonight
and I fell for it. -BEN: Yeah. Damn.
-Y'all want
to let me win tomorrow? MARIA:
 I am on the bottom, and now, you know,

to today's immunity challenge? -Yes.

-For the third time,
I have to take it back. -(applause)
-One more, Jeff.
I got one more in me. PROBST:
Whoa. That was a big prediction. (laughs) All right,
for today's challenge, you're gonna race
 through a series of obstacles. Once you're through,
 you'll retrieve a rope and use it to drop a bridge. You'll then cross that bridge
 and retrieve a key, then climb to the finish,
 where you will use that key to unlock your puzzle pieces. Once you've finished
 your puzzle, it will reveal the solution
 to a combination lock. First person
 to solve their combination and bang their gong... wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final four, which means you cannot
be voted out of this game. At the very least,
you're making fire for a shot to get to three. In addition, playing for reward. -I knew it.
-Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yes.
-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah. The winner will be taken
to the sanctuary, where good things happen,
for pasta... -Oh.
-Caesar salad, -Oh. Nice. Yes.
-garlic bread, -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-macaroons, chocolate pudding, -Mm-hmm.
-wine and soda. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be
the 14th person voted out, become the seventh member
of our jury. Everybody knows this.
I got to say it. Maria, if you win
today's challenge, -you join an elite group
of four women.
-Wow. The only four women
in the history of Survivor to win four
individual immunity challenges. A lot at stake.
Draw for spots. We'll get it on! -Here we go.
-PROBST: Here we go.
-Let's do it, let's do it. All right, here we go.
For a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going
through a muddy net. -You're gonna
get covered in mud.
-LIZ: Oh, my God. -It doesn't matter.
It's day 24.
-(Charlie groaning) You want to get to day 25. Right here! Everybody struggling
through that net. Charlie's gonna be out first.
Use the water if you need it. You're gonna need your eyes
to see. Ow! -PROBST: Kenzie's through!
-Ooh! PROBST:
Maria's through. Ben is through. Now you're pulling out rope
to release that plank. The only way through
is to pull that plank out and then cross. Here comes Liz. Everybody working
on their ropes. Every second could count
in this challenge. Charlie down to his last bit. Plank's out. He's good. Maria's got her plank out.
She's good. It is Maria and Charlie at opposite ends. Here comes Kenzie. Charlie through
the next obstacle. Maria's through it. Charlie's dropped
his monkey's fist. Maria has hers.
Here comes Kenzie. Now you've got
to drop your bridge, using that ball of rope. Kenzie has hers! -Ooh. Yay!
-PROBST: She's in this. Here comes Ben. -Liz now in the tunnel.
-(grunting) Ben's got his. He's good. Maria with a nice toss.
That's gonna do it. Maria first to drop her bridge. Charlie drops his bridge. Now retrieve your key. We are neck and neck right now with Charlie and Maria. Here comes Liz. -Aah!
-PROBST: Ben a little short. Maria has her key.
She's heading up. Maria now in the lead. Charlie has his key.
He's heading up. Kenzie drops her bridge,
working on her key. Now you got to climb up and unlock those puzzle pieces. Ben and Liz still working
to drop their bridge. Liz has her bridge dropped. Ben's got it. Liz heading up. Kenzie has her key. Ben working on his key. Liz looking for her key. -Ugh!
-She forgot it. -Ugh!
-She's got to come back down
and go get it. Maria working on her puzzle.
Kenzie working. Charlie working.
Ben has his key. He's up top now,
working on his puzzle. Liz had to go all the way back. She forgot her key. Day 24, final five challenge, huge stakes. Reward is secondary. You want immunity right now. Here comes Liz
heading back up again. We're gonna have everybody
on the puzzle. Another complicated Survivor puzzle. It'll give you
all the information you need to solve that combination lock. Then you bang that gong
and you're good. Kenzie making a lot
of progress on this puzzle. Charlie getting
a little more momentum now. You cannot slow down. Do not stop digging right here. We are very close.
Kenzie and Maria. Maria with another piece. Kenzie down to six pieces. Maria at nine. Kenzie with another piece. And another. Kenzie down to four pieces left. Guaranteed spot at four. Everybody else
vulnerable tonight. Kenzie, one piece left. She's got the puzzle done. -Oh, my God.
-Now what? ♪ ♪ New twist in this challenge. You think the puzzle is the end,
but it's not. You've got to read the puzzle. Everything you need
is on the puzzle. Maria now closing in
on her puzzle. Holes in your plank? Confusion now. What is happening? PROBST:
We've never seen this before
in a challenge. Liz now running back, appears to be
going to help Kenzie. Got to go over the obstacles. Maria has her puzzle finished. Now she's working on it. Everything up in the air now. It's Kenzie trying
to figure out the combination, Maria trying
to figure out the combination. PROBST:
The puzzle contains information you need
to finish this challenge. Maria now gonna head back out. Got to go over
all the obstacles. Here comes Liz, coming back. She's carrying the plank. The only guess
is she is helping Kenzie. Maria now moving
through those rope rungs as fast as she can. Liz now here
with Kenzie's plank. Maria on her own,
trying to get her plank and get back here. They've got what they need.
Can they figure it out? PROBST:
No! PROBST:
Something got to be wrong. Here comes Maria.
She's got her plank. Kenzie and Liz working together. Maria on her own. Immunity on the line. Thirty-five. PROBST:
Kenzie has it, bangs the gong. -It is over.
-Yes! Oh, my God! -Yes!
-With the help of Liz, -Yes, yes, yes!
-Kenzie's won her second immunity challenge,
guaranteed a spot -in the final four.
-KENZIE: Oh, my God. You deserve it and more. PROBST:
Maria just a little short. KENZIE:
Maria. Good job. Wow.
Another unpredictable moment in an absolutely unpredictable season of Survivor. LIZ:
You're a badass. It takes two to beat you.
You're a badass, Maria. -KENZIE: Yeah,
you're incredible, Maria.
-LIZ: Seriously. Kenzie, come on over. -Yeah.
-For the second time
this season, -individual immunity is yours.
-Dude. -You are guaranteed a spot
in the final four.
-Yeah. It means you will never
be voted out this season. -Yeah.
-At the very least, -Kenzie!
-Go, Kenzie!
-you got a shot at making fire. Yeah, I can-I can taste it.
You know, I... (whoops) Thank you so much, Liz.
Like, Maria, you're incredible. Like, we had to team up
to beat you. Like, that just proves, like, what an amazing competitor
you are. It just made sense. When Liz saw she wasn't
gonna finish her puzzle, it was just like,
""Okay, girl, we got to go."" Maria, it is one of the most
interesting facets of Survivor-- is that the better you are, the bigger the target you are. I take it as a compliment,
honestly. Like, I have exceeded
my expectations out here, and if it took two people
to beat me, then, like, it's a big compliment to me -and good for them
for teaming up.
-It is a compliment. You know, it's not over
until you snuff my torch. PROBST:
All right, so here's
what's gonna happen. You're gonna leave here,
go to the sanctuary. -CHARLIE: Wow.
-Yeah.
-You're choosing one person. Who are you gonna take with you
to the sanctuary? I'm torn because,
Liz, you helped me, but Ben's the only one
who's never seen it. -Like, what...
-I'd go with Ben. I'm allergic to pasta. -KENZIE: Oh, okay.
-Are you serious? -Yeah.
-Bennie boy. You haven't seen
the sanctuary yet. All right, so here's
what's gonna happen. You two are gonna
head out to the sanctuary. -Okay.
-You'll return back to camp
in time for Tribal Council. -Grab your stuff, head out.
-Do I get a hug? -Oh.
-Buddy hug. I love buddy hugs.
-Let's go. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Congrats. Thank you. Down the steps, hang a right.
Boat'll pick you up. -KENZIE: Thank you so much.
-BEN: Thanks, Liz. -LIZ: Have fun.
-KENZIE: Thanks. Let's go chill hard, buddy. -Let's go chill hard!
-PROBST: All right, Maria, Charlie, Liz, got nothing
for you. Grab your stuff. Head back camp. See you tonight
at Tribal Council where somebody will be the 14th person
voted out, seventh member of our jury. -See you tonight.
-Jeff.
-Thank you. LIZ: Yes, what I did
 was wild, but I'm trying
to make it to the end. And honestly,
 that's all I care about. It seems like a no-brainer
 that tonight is Maria's night. But this is Survivor. This is the final five. Anything can happen. Well, it's been one of
the most unpredictable seasons of Survivor, and honestly, it's
why I still love doing this job. Come on out.

I can't believe I won immunity. Dude. And it was, like,
the most important -and sickest
immunity of the season.
-And the po... I didn't care
which one of us won it as long as it wasn't Maria. -Damn right.
-Oh. Cheers. My dude. -To chillin' mad hard.
-To chillin' mad hard. Going into
 the immunity challenge today, there was one common goal,
and it was for Maria to not win. And Liz helped me win immunity, which I was surprised at. She is so unpredictable.
 She's like a secret assassin. This is heaven. It's a perfect day, and
I'm not getting voted out, ever. I'm here to stay, baby. Like, I'm going to final four
whether y'all like it or not. Honestly, today is,
like, amazing for me. -Like, winning...
-Because the high
is so high today. -Like...
-I know, and, like,
I get to be out here -with, like, my Survivor bestie.
-Oh, my God, it's sick. (laughs) It was so sick Kenzie picked me
 for the reward today because in this game, you hope to make alliances,
and then you make a real friend with a person like Kenzie. Like, how can you not feel grateful to shred
in a situation like this? When I go home,
I just have to catch up on all the things
I ignored for years 'cause I was too busy
trying to rock my hardest. -Gonna get my driver's license.
-Hell yeah. -That's a good place to start.
-Yeah. If you want to be an adult, -we should get
a driver's license.
-Exactly. On top of that,
 we're sitting in Fiji, overlooking one of the most
 epic landscapes of all time. It's such a vibe.
It's, like, electric, almost. What do we do when we get back?
I don't want to come in cocky and be like,
""Oh, Maria tonight,"" you know? Feels, like, too perfect. I would be shocked
if something crazy happened. BEN:
 I think we're all
 on the same page 'cause the enemy is so common. Maria is a whole-package threat. Multiple immunities,
decimated people's gameplay, played an epic game
 of deception. So, unless she finds an idol
 or pulls a blindside, Maria's done. MARIA:
Well, that was a fun challenge. -It was fun, Maria.
-CHARLIE: Oh, my God.
-It was fun. -I do love you, dude.
-I love you, too. You're just such
a friggin' competitor, dude. I love you, too.
Thank you for saying that. -I'm just really scared
of going home.
-Don't worry about it. -Don't worry about it.
-I still really... -I'm still really scared.
-You know what? -I'm so proud of myself. -CHARLIE: Liz going over to Kenzie to help
to take down Maria-- that says, to me,
 Liz is here to play. MARIA:
I'm gonna spend the afternoon
looking for idols. If I can find one,
I'm gonna pretend -I don't have one.
-CHARLIE: Yup. And then you and I take out
whoever we want to take out. I think, that's... I mean... After last Tribal Council, I made sure that my door
to work with Maria was open. 'Cause I didn't know
 what today would bring. So, I want to solidify Maria as my champion
if she's going home tonight, and as someone
who's gonna work with me if she finds an idol. -We just should just check
-Mm-hmm. tree mail, water well,
underneath, -and then go the back way,
-Yes. -and then go back down
to the beach.
-Okay. MARIA: It's really hard
 to come back to camp knowing that
Liz just worked against me. I'm, like, super pissed. But at the same time,
 I'm like, ""Damn."" Like, maybe it just takes
two people to beat me. This is cool. This feels like
it would be a good -""tied to a branch"" tree.
-Mm-hmm. MARIA: My plan from here
 is to find an idol or convince somebody to work with me. MARIA:
 I think Charlie has
 forgiven me and would work with me,
 but that's not enough. We need one more person. Let's go! Let's go! MARIA:
 So, today is definitely gonna
be an uphill climb in the snow, barefoot. I've just never been one
to give up. Like, I just... It's not in me to give up. (chuckles) Hi. You coming
to keep tabs on me? No, I was just looking
to talk to you. Oh.
Here's my pitch to you. You got to know
that, like, with Ben, I've distrusted him
since day one. -That's why
we're not working together.
-Yeah. Like, the fact that
he's trying to convince you that he accidentally
wrote ""Kenzie."" -You wouldn't...
-I've never believed -he accidentally wrote ""Kenzie.""
-But that's what I'm saying. You're about to move forward
with somebody who's so deceptive,
and I'm telling you, -I'm an open book.
-Yeah. I just don't think
I can beat you. -I think I can beat Ben.
-Yeah. KENZIE:
 Maria's selling
 Ben writing my name down a couple of days ago
 wasn't an accident. She is fighting for her life right now, which I respect,
 but she's almost making her argument worse
by being so convincing. I'm like, ""No,
you're even more dangerous."" Her pitching Ben is foolish. There's no way any of us
 are gonna fall for that. MARIA:
I'm gonna put myself out there. -LIZ: Mm.
-Big time, 'cause I got
nothing to lose. -Yeah.
-Ben wrote Kenzie's
name down on purpose. -That was not an accident.
-Hmm. And he lied to her face, and -he's been lying to her face.
-LIZ: Wow. Ben's been playing a game
that nobody knows, and he's very charismatic. He is fully capable of pulling something out
at Final Tribal. He could come out and say,
""Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. ""None of you even knew -that I was doing this.""
-Yeah. What if he has this,
like, rocking story? I have no idea.
That's the scary part. MARIA:
Taking Ben to the final three
is dangerous. -Yeah.
-MARIA: And I think the decision
is in your hands, really. LIZ:
Well, we would
all have to do that. I know that this is crazy, but Maria really got to me
about Ben and the unknown. If he drops a bomb or two, it might be just enough
 for him to win the game. That's terrifying. I've been so focused
 on trying to get Maria out, but is that really
 what is best for Liz? Ben, Ben, Ben. CHARLIE:
 If you told me this morning Maria goes to Liz and pitches Ben
as the vote out tonight, I would have
laughed you off of Fiji. But it seems like Liz is willing to do
something different tonight. KENZIE:
We're all just
voting Maria, right? -Yeah.
-Like, why does tonight
feel so heavy when it should be so easy? CHARLIE:
 Maria has a lot
 of enemies in this game. Ben, on the other hand,
 has friends on the jury. He's a great storyteller, he's charismatic, and we've been together since day one. So I'm worried the jury
might see us as similar players. He could easily get
 some of my jury votes, and that's dangerous. I don't know. MARIA:
 I am so scared because tonight could be the end for me. I've done all I can do, but if I can pull off this move, I'm gonna win this game. And so, tonight
 is a massive night. It's do-or-die for me. (V O) Fe ed in g a hi gh -q ua li ty d og f oo d doesn't have to cost a whole

pneumonia vaccine. So am I. Because I'm at risk
for pneumococcal pneumonia. Come on. I already got
a pneumonia vaccine, but I'm asking about the added
protection of Prevnar 20®. If you're 19 or older with
 certain chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease,
 or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal
 pneumonia. Prevnar 20® is

 pneumonia. In just one dose. Don't get Prevnar 20®
 if you've had a severe allergic
 reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened
 immune systems may have a lower response
 to the vaccine. The most common
 side effects were pain and swelling at the injection
 site, muscle pain, fatigue,
 headache, and joint pain. I want to be able
to keep my plans. I don't want to risk
ending up in the hospital with pneumococcal
pneumonia. That's why I chose
Prevnar 20®. Ask your doctor or pharmacist
 about the Pfizer vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ All right.
Let's just get right into it. Today was an interesting day
at the challenge. Kenzie's in the lead.
Maria's on her tail. And at that point, Liz decides,
""I'm gonna help Kenzie."" And it worked.
Kenzie wins individual immunity. Congratulations. But, Maria,
where does that sit, knowing that they were working together
to make sure you didn't win? Honestly, I have
no hard feelings at all. I think at 47 with three small kids at home and three immunity challenges
under my belt, I hold my head up high,
and I feel super proud
of the game that I played. PROBST:
And I just want to say, there are a lot of people
that look at Survivor now and feel like
it's a younger person's game, but then somebody
like you shows up and says, ""Oh, no, no. ""Oh, I still got game. I got a lot of game."" And, Ben, the better you are, the bigger the target. That's just how
the game goes, you know? Maria's a great player. I still think
she is the MVP of the season. But no hard feelings. We all have to outlast, outplay, outwit, outshred,
whatever it is. The bottom line is
we have to play the game. PROBST:
Kenzie, what Ben
is saying is that you do develop relationships, and sometimes
they become like this, but then sometimes they do this. Doesn't mean you can't
play the game with somebody, but it does mean
if I have the opportunity to take you out, I might. And it sounds like Ben
is saying, ""I have no problem writing
Maria's name down tonight."" -Am I getting this right?
-Yeah, definitely. KENZIE:
Yeah. Maria's incredible. Like, an amazing woman. -Thank you.
-KENZIE: I admire you.
I respect you. I love you deeply. And that is what's
crazy about Survivor, is that I can look someone
in the face and be like, ""You could kick my ass
up and down this game."" So I have to write
your name down tonight. -I totally understand.
-KENZIE: Because... ...you would beat all of us. You're amazing. -You are wonderful.
-Thank you, Kenzie. -I love you.
-I love you, too. Liz, Ben and Kenzie
have been very open. They're voting Maria.
So, where are you? I'm just ready
to focus on the game. Sometimes I'm like
a horse with blinders on. When I was helping Kenzie
with the puzzle today, I wasn't thinking
about Maria's feelings. Afterwards, I was definitely
thinking about her feelings and what a jerk I looked like. And so it's really hard, but Maria and I, we're like two ships passing in the night.
Like, we could have been the, like,
most dynamic duo out here, but for some reason, instead
of attracting each other, we just kept getting further and
further apart with each vote. Charlie, where are you
with Maria? Yeah, so... Maria and I have worked really side by side
a lot of this game. We've got 24 days together. You know,
you have people that you build these insane bonds with, and then you have to
vote each other out. Tonight, it's almost like
a sibling rivalry moment. PROBST:
Maria, from my vantage point,
you've been very gracious about handling this pressure
and having a target and even having them
double-team, trying to get at you. How are you able
to play the game as hard as you've played
but also understand, ""You're coming for me. If you can get me,
you should get me."" Um, I think any competitor knows how to win
and knows how to lose. And I can honor and respect any move that takes down
a fierce competitor like myself. There's also the knowledge that
my kids are watching. My kids are watching tonight. You know? And I plan
on walking out of here with my head held high. (sniffles) I'm proud of myself,
I'm proud of my game, and I know that they're
gonna be proud of me. And being ungracious-- like, that's not
what I want them to do. And so I'm going to be
an example to them. PROBST:
Where does that come from? I guess it comes
from my upbringing. You know, I'm-I'm an immigrant. I come from Beirut, Lebanon, and you know, I grew up with, I guess,
an environment of survival. You know, work hard,
be determined and to be honest
and to be respectful and to be gracious
and to be humble. And I think to myself, ""My husband and I
are raising three boys, ""and Daddy is strong as hell. But you know what?
Mommy is, too."" PROBST:

 You're gonna have a timer

 Here's how it works. You're gonna start by rolling
 your ball up an inclined ramp. While the ball is making
 its way back down the ramp, you can work on your puzzle. When the ball
 reaches the bottom, you got to stop, grab your ball, roll it again. But if you fail to get your ball
before it hits the metal track, then you have to wait as the ball slowly makes its way to the bottom. And during that time,
 you can't work on your puzzle. So during this entire challenge,

 friends I made out here, and she's been my number one

All right. We get to our final
immunity challenge. On the surface,
it's very simple. Just solve the Survivor logo puzzle in front of you. But there was a twist.
Ben, you were the only person
that didn't make any mistakes
in the challenge. Explain that, because
you walked in and said, ""I am all over the place today,"" and yet something
crystallized, and you were perfect in that challenge. BEN:
You know, I didn't
go into that challenge expecting to win. I said that 'cause it was true.
I haven't been able to sleep. Night terrors, panic attacks. It's just very, very brutal. For some reason, today,
I just decided to say, ""This is it.
I'm just gonna go for it."" I don't know. I had a blast.
It just came together. PROBST:
Charlie, you were
in it for a while, but a couple of mistakes
cost you this challenge. What did you reflect on
this afternoon? Today's immunity challenge
is potentially the one with the most power
of the season. Ben's, of course, safe tonight, but tonight he can do
whatever the heck he wants. So... it was a lot of reflecting, but there's not much
time for reflection when all I was really doing was making fires all day. Kenzie, you were very close. Would have been your third
individual immunity win. You, too, had issues,
not with getting the ball late, but with just
getting the ball up the ramp, and those few extra tosses
were the difference. You were a few pieces behind. Yeah, I was three pieces behind. And they will probably
haunt me forever. Like, crumbles. I'm happy
for my friend, but here we are. Liz, what was
your experience today? ""Liz, you're the biggest threat. ""You're definitely
going to fire. I don't know
who's going against you."" -Yeah.
-LIZ: And then I just fell apart,
'cause I suck at fire. And, um, I knew this was the one hole in my game. And I'm gonna go to fire.
I mean, he's totally right. I've never
had my name written down, so, he's smarter than he looks. -(chuckles)
-So, Ben, you had
one easy decision. -You knew Liz, immediately.
-Yeah. So then the debate became Kenzie or Charlie. Yeah. And when it came down to
Kenzie and Charlie, I mean, Charlie's the first friend
I made out here. I know that's not great
when it comes to talking about your strategy, but if somebody can give you
a little bit of kindness, it goes a long way, whether
they know it or not. And the hard part is
my friendship with Kenzie is very similar, except
I only met Kenzie at the merge. But I'd say her impact
on me feeling sane-- it's like, I can't...
I can't oversell it. Like, I'm playing Survivor, but I'm hanging out with
my homies and having, like, a real human experience
that, like, you know, it sucks that I have to make this decision. PROBST:
So, Ben, are you ready
to tell us your decision? So, it's gonna
be Liz and Kenzie tonight going at it for fire. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
Which means, Charlie, you made it to the final three. You will take that second spot. This is what you dream of, because
getting to the final three is as much as any player can do. You've gone as far as
you can go. What's the feeling? CHARLIE:
I'm grateful to Ben,
you know, in this moment. Because of the relationship
and the bond that we've built, he's gonna take me
to the final three. And getting there with that bond means just as much to me
as making fire. PROBST:
Kenzie, what's it like
to hear that when you can hear a little bit
of emotion in Ben's voice, and he's very clearly saying, ""It wasn't easy for me because of love and friendship""? KENZIE:
Yeah. There is emotion. Like, we have, like,
fallen in love with each other, and it's so complicated. But at the same time, as annoyed as I am
that I have to do this, I am grateful that I'm not
getting my name written down and that I get a chance to try, you know?

Oh, my God, it's so good. Guys, we're eating
like humans again. I'm chilling hard today,
 but tonight, I have to give the performance
of a lifetime. My game was a game of honesty built around being myself and relying on my social cards. Everybody called me
 a vibe person. Tonight is about showing that a vibe or chillin' isn't
about being one-dimensional. It's not me using it
 as a gimmick. It's about showing
 I played a hard game from day one. Q:
 Ben outwitted, outlast, outplayed us. The game he played
 was to rock out and fly underneath the radar. If he can articulate
 that he was behind moves, he could receive Q's vote. SODA:
 Ben shreds, Ben rips, Ben rocks. That's who Ben is. He's a social threat
 playing an emotional game that really worked for him,
 but it's ""outwit, outplay, outlast,""
not ""outlove."" My game has been about adapting
 and knowing when to sit back and when to step up. I had a fake idol play. I was a huge part in taking out the biggest threats in the game, and I beat Liz in fire-making. My biggest challenge tonight
 with the jury is that I've written a lot
of their names down. I don't think
anybody's holding back tonight. I know I'm not. Like, guns are blazing. I know my story's better
 than Charlie and Ben's. It's just about how I sell it. VENUS: Kenzie's social game
 was brilliant. I don't think there's a single
person who disliked her or didn't get along with her,
 but I want to hear from her specifically
 what moves she made. You have to have played the game to earn my vote. TIFFANY:
 Kenzie is somebody
 who cares about people, and I do believe that that's why
she lasted so long in the game. Friendship aside,
 gameplay at the forefront, I deeply feel that she's
the best candidate right now. CHARLIE:
I had power in the game
to send home who I thought... I had power in the game
to send home... or to work with who I thought
was going to be able to carry me forward
another vote. I played a very strategic game worthy of the title
 of Sole Survivor. I built alliances, constantly. I never closed a door to anyone. I've always made sure that I put myself in a position
where I was safe, but I also had power. But a lot of what I did
 was in the shadows. Tonight, I want to pull back the curtain on what I've done. The biggest hurdle
 is what the heck is the jury thinking of me? HUNTER:
 Charlie has done a good job of having his finger
 on the pulse. And he's also been winning
 immunity challenges, and so, he has, potentially,
 a story to tell that is worth a million dollars. MARIA: Charlie and I worked
 together so long that I'm pretty sure
 I know all of his moves, except when it came
to him trying to take me out. But my criteria
 is not friendship. I want to make sure that
the person I write down tonight deserves this money. KENZIE:
Is there anything
on your Survivor bucket list you didn't get to do? Uh, win Sole Survivor?
No, I'm kidding. -(laughs)
-Not yet. That one's still up for grabs. VENUS:
 There's always a chance to change the jury's minds. Every single person can sway me
with what they have to say. Q:
 It's not won yet. You can go in and change minds, so don't blow it. SODA:
 I'm not just gonna
 hand money out. You need to have done something. MARIA:

 what you were doing and why you deserve to win this game. All right.
Charlie, Kenzie, Ben--
glad to see smiles. You should be smiling. You made it to the final three. You did what 15 other players could not do. You survived every Tribal
that you went to. And now, one of the most
unique aspects of Survivor is that
the power shifts from this side to the jury. Eight players who also were in this game

side effects. Problems can occur together
and more often when OPDIVO

into our final Tribal Council. We've been forming the jury
for many days. Tonight is
your first opportunity to ask them the questions
you need to decide who played the best game. Let's get into it. Who wants to get us started? -I will.
-Go, Tiff. Well, first of all,
good evening. And on behalf of myself and everybody sitting here
on the jury, we want to say congratulations
on making it to final three. We have very specific questions
for you guys tonight, and we're looking
for very specific answers. Also, please understand, we are not looking
for Taylor Swift lyrics. We are not looking
for pop culture or rock and roll references.
We are looking for serious
and thought-provoking responses. And with that being said, can you articulate one move that you made on your own that changed the course
of the game? I would like Ben to go first. That's a hard one. For me, I got dealt a hand that really sucked
when I entered the merge, and I had to rely
on my social game. I felt one thing
that I did help contribute to that was sort of a move, was go to the people who had given me
an opportunity to talk and people
who had been on the outs of their crew,
bringing people together, mainly going to Kenzie,
Charlie and Liz. TIFFANY: So, your move
was that you brought Kenzie, Charlie, and Liz together to
change the course of the game? -Of getting me out.
-Of getting Q out to... Okay.
-Yeah. Which was late, but again,
like I said, I was not dealt -the best hand.
-TIFFANY: Charlie,
you have something -to say?
-CHARLIE: Yes.
Just, on that point, when this alliance
came together, Kenzie, Ben, Liz and Venus all wanted Q out
in the final seven vote. But a big part
of my game was making sure that there was a four
going into six, 'cause I needed Q and Maria
as shields, and if Q had gone out there
when Maria won immunity at final six, I, probably, am sitting
on the jury. -Okay, well, since we're on you,
can you tell me what
-Yeah. -the move is that you made that
changed the course of the game?
-My... The move that I would pick
would be the Hunter vote. At the Hunter vote, there was
actually an initial plan from Kenzie
to blindside you, Tiff. But Hunter's
a real social threat and strategic threat,
especially given he's got strong allies
of Soda and Tevin on the jury. That was also the day
that I beat Hunter in individual immunity. You know, that was, to me,
a big accomplishment. So I thought that was the time
to go after Hunter and build out my options. HUNTER:
Not to take away the move
that you made, but I came into this Tribal
gonna play my idol. I had the Shot in the Dark
and the idol in my pocket. And the person that
actually convinced me not to is, uh, Kenzie. She, like, sold me on that. TIFFANY:
Okay, thank you. -Kenzie?
-KENZIE: Okay, so, post-merge, I wanted Tim to go. I knew I couldn't beat him, and
a lot of us had that thought. But at the same time,
Tiff and Q, who were my number-one allies, did not like Ben at all. So it was back and forth between
Tim and Ben all afternoon. Q would come over to me and be
like, ""It's Ben. Let's vote Ben. -He has the idol.""
-Q: No, no, no. -I was never gonna vote Ben.
-KENZIE: To me... Tiff? -I have to agree with Kenzie.
We went back and forth
-No. -Thank you. Yes, you did.
-several times between Tim and Ben
that day in the woods, -which is why I also was upset.
-KENZIE: All day. -Y'all did, right?
-KENZIE: No, you did. -You did... with us.
-No, no. No. You might have woken up
with that Tim, but you had Ben at 02:00,
you had Tim at 2:30, you had... -Nope.
-KENZIE: At the last minute, you said, ""Fine, you can
have Ben."" And then I said... -And go Tiff.
-Wait. Tiffany said -she wanted Ben, not Q.
-I'm saying -you guys were
arguing about it all day.
-Q: You wanted Ben out. Q, I'd like for Kenzie
to answer the question. Well, I'm not about
to argue on this jury right now. -Right.
-LIZ: I don't want to argue.
-KENZIE: Regardless, when I was playing
with someone like Q, I can't fight with that.
Obviously. He doesn't remember
what he says to me. You know what I mean?
So I had to play in a way that Q would hear me
and think it was his idea. Like, that
was an intentional move that I wanted
when I won immunity. We went back and forth all day, and I was the last one with
the whisper that made it happen. All right, who's up? Me. The question
I have for each of you is what is one mistake
that you made in this game that you were ultimately able
to flip on its head and capitalize on
to use to your advantage? -Charlie?
-Okay. V, I'm so glad
this question came from you. At the very first vote
in merge limbo, there were-- I don't know--
ten votes for Mo and one vote for Venus. Also, after that vote, Q gave me a big old thump on the back. And let me tell you,
when Q thumps you on the back, you notice it. He took me down to the boat,
lecturing me on, you know, why
I shouldn't have done that move. I was very receptive
to everything you said, and I wanted to, in that moment,
build a relationship with someone who was
having a lot of power early in the game.
The next morning, Q invites me in to the six, and I was part
of a new alliance. So-- very fun. MARIA:
I just want to be clear that I invited you into the six. So you came into the six
on my invitation. Yes, you were my recommendation
letter into the six. -I didn't have one.
-In hindsight, it's not that... -It's just not great to be
-It's literally, like... -No, no, no.
-part of the six. MARIA: You don't want to be
part of the six. This six is... TIFFANY:
You probably should have -just left that part out, then.
-(Hunter mumbling) -Look at his laugh.
-CHARLIE: I just... -I love the six, you know.
-Q: Being in the six -was a one-way ticket home.
-(laughing) KENZIE:
Like, y'all can keep your six. HUNTER:
We just never talked about it. It just was a pathetic excuse
for an alliance. So, Kenzie, you're up. -Good-good response, though.
-KENZIE: One mistake I made was I got cocky. I wasn't paying attention.
I got confident, I got comfortable,
and ultimately, Tiff went home. Tiff and I were like,
""Don't even play the idol, girl. Like, you'll get into six.
We're good."" -We were riding too high
together, okay?
-We were. I'll be the first to admit it.
I got cocky, too, girl. -That's why I'm over here.
-KENZIE: Yeah, we... That hit me like a bullet train.
I immediately started rebuilding relationships
with everyone, paying attention
to who was working with who, and it became very apparent that
Maria and Q were number ones, which led the three of us and Liz coming together
to ultimately take out the two biggest threats
who had started working together -at that vote.
-Q: So, of course. -Yeah.
-Q: Did y'all come together at six or seven?
'Cause at seven, why would Ben write your name
as the contingency plan? 'Cause he was drunk on pizza. That's what I'm saying.
So, I'm confused. KENZIE:
That is the question
of the hour. We... we worked together
at seven, but just because
Ben wrote my name down, whether it wasn't an accident
or not, I didn't go home. Well, she had an idol.
If she would've played it, you would have. Maybe. But we were working together, and we all ultimately decided. That is true. KENZIE:
Yeah. Thank you, Liz. But just to address
the-the accidental voting. -Yeah.
-TEVIN: I know you had
ate pizza, but were you a bit lackadaisical
in the tribe, and you weren't... -you listening during Tribal,
and that's...
-BEN: No. I think, on top of me having pizza in my stomach, I have been having night terrors
since about day 13 or 14. The truth is I lost my bearings. I was really as out of it
as it could be. -Yeah. Okay. Got it.
-And we can all appreciate that. There's a lot of us looking back at Tribal Council,
should have seen red flags. I mean, we're talking
about idol, idol, idol, idol. And so,
I'll give you the benefit -of the doubt, you know.
-BEN: Yeah. Sometimes Tribals are a little
bit crazy, and we miss things. Yeah. PROBST:
Who's up? -Tevin.
-TEVIN: Hi, y'all. So, my question
to you all tonight is I want your
one best example of how you used one of us
sitting up here on the jury to further your game
and make it to the final three. -Let's start with Ben.
-BEN: All right. At some point in the game,
I was stuck with Q and Maria for, like,
three days straight. For those three days, all I was fed was,
""This is what you need to do, this is who
you shouldn't trust."" Nobody asked me
what my input was on anything. There was no moment
where it was like, ""Hey, this is what I think
our next move has to be."" -Well, that's the point.
-So, can I ask
the follow-up question? -BEN: Totally.
-Wouldn't you assert your ideas -Yeah.
-on the group to try
to make a move of your own? I took my ""chillin' hard""
approach, which was, ""I'm gonna listen,
I'm gonna hear what they have to say,"" and using
that information is what I went to Kenzie with,
I went to Charlie with, what I went to Liz with, and it's what allowed me
to slip through the cracks, whether I was thought of
as a threat or not. -Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Kenzie, you're up. KENZIE:
So, after the Tiff
blindside, I was out for blood, and then
I had to manage my emotions. I wanted Q out
immediately after. I was so upset, I was so hurt. But I had to placate
and pretend to go with numbers to gain Q's trust back
to get back in good graces. And that's how quick I went from
devastated crying all night, out for blood to, ""Okay,
I'm back working with the guy ""that I want out of here
so I can get him out tomorrow if I can gain his trust today."" -Great.
-Thank you.
-Excellent. -Charlie?
-Charlie?
-Concise. Uh, so, for me, the person
that I used was actually Tevin. For me, coming into the merge,
Nami was an enigma. They're either the best actors
in the world or there are really
cracks everywhere. -Yeah.
-But there was so much
information going around because Soda was telling me she was tight with Tevin,
but here Tevin was saying he wanted
to blindside Soda, and what I figured out from that is
that Tevin was the power player. Okay. -Thank y'all.
-CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah. HUNTER:
I got it ready, Jeff. -Okay. Go, Hunter.
-HUNTER: Okay. So, last Tribal Council,
Ben was on the hot seat and had to lay out
a lot of information as to who he saw as threats, who can make fire and not. So, my question is gonna be
for Charlie and for Kenzie. If you were in Ben's seat, who would you put in fire
and why would you do it? I would have put the exact
same thing that Ben did. I would have gone against Liz. I know that these two boys have a similar game
and that I have a better chance at beating them
than I had beating Liz. And I would have
taken a chance on myself. -That's what I would have done.
-HUNTER: Awesome. Appreciate it. -Charlie?
-Yes. So, if I had won
the necklace that day, I think I would have done things
a little bit differently. -Okay.
-I think I would have taken Liz with me to the final three. I think, personally, my game could stack up well
against hers. I think that's someone
that I could have beat, -despite her being a threat.
-HUNTER: Okay, well, then, was there any moment
that you thought, ""Hey, Ben, let me do this? Let me put myself in,
because Liz isn't the threat""? My game has been all about
getting to this moment. So I didn't feel the need
to push insanely hard to get into fire for a move that I didn't think was
going to buy me all that much. HUNTER:
Right, and I appreciate that. But I hope getting to this point in a safe way
doesn't hurt you, right? You said your goal
was to get to this point. I hope your goal
was to win this game. You better believe it.
That has been my laser focus this whole time. My goal was
to win this freaking game. Okay. Yup. -Soda?
-SODA: Um, I have been on the jury the longest. Um, I have been listening,
um, to a lot. Ben, my take on you was that you
were playing an emotional game and that you had no agency. Charlie, my take on you was that you were playing the middle
very closely with Maria, but you did not set yourself
apart from her. And, Kenzie, my take on you was that you were brought
into votes pre-merge. And post-merge, you said,
""Tell me who to vote for."" Now, I've heard a lot
of information that, you know, contests
some of those things, but I want each of you to take 30 seconds to either prove me right
or persuade me why I'm wrong. Also, I'll be
the 30-second timer. When I say ""time,"" please stop. SODA:
Kenzie? So, I'm a social player. I'm not the loudest voice
in the room. I'm not the one
who's gonna be a driving force, but I am a number, and I am
also thinking strategically. Like, my social game
is my strategic game. They are one and the same.
I know they're supposed to be separate,
but I'm a people person. I've had deep conversations
with each of you. I've, like, held half of you while you've cried
about various things. Like, yeah, I got
brought along on votes. That's how I ended up here. -I'll take it. I'll own it.
It's true.
-TIFFANY: Time. -I'm not gonna say
I drove a vote. Okay.
-SODA: Time. Nice ownership. Thank you.
Charlie? CHARLIE:
Maria and I were
partners in crime for a lot of the game,
but by the time Maria was winding back her fist to throw a punch at me, I had already
put the pieces in place that were setting up her demise. I put together the four
that protected me from the punch that you and Q
threw at me at final six, and ultimately voted both of you
out of the game at six and at five,
exactly how I designed after the Tiffany vote. I thought that I needed... -to differentiate...
-Time.
-Time. -Ben?
-Oh, yeah. I mean,
I'll definitely agree. I'm probably
the most emotional person, most ""cries in this game""
this season, but that's what I had to do, and it crushed me that I felt I came
into the merge with this plan that got wrecked, and I was very fortunate that how emotional I was
opened the doors to make friendships and bonds that allowed me
to be part of moves that I wanted to be part of.
And, yeah, I openly admitted
I was a goat for a few votes. But when the turn came
to not be that, the only way -that would have happened...
-Time. -SODA: Time.
-Yeah. Cool. Thank you all so much.
I know that was hard, um, -but you all did great.
-BEN: All good. Q, you haven't asked a question. All righty.
The most important thing for me and my vote
is this simple question. What do you plan
to do with the money and how will it change
your life? -Ben?
-Um, you know, I'm a musician. I get a lot
of great things in my life, but I don't make a lot of money. I want to give my parents
some sort of retirement 'cause they're hardworking
immigrants that always put food
on the table and weren't around
because of how hard they worked. And at the same time,
I want to join up with my best friend's
nonprofit program and help bring music education back to schools
in South Florida. It's an initiative I've already
been a part of called Young Musicians Unite. And having an artistic
expression for kids is a way for them to feel comfortable
with who they are, which is something
I had to learn the hard way 'cause nobody gave me that
opportunity when I was a kid. Q:
Thank you, Ben. -Charlie?
-CHARLIE: Yeah, so, number one: family is more
important to me than anything. And to be where I am at
in my life-- you know, I'm 25 years old, and a million dollars
is a whole lot of money. Life-changing. I can set up
the rest of my life for me and my family. You know, part of this
experience has been getting to meet
and know all of you. And if there's one thing
I know, it's that every single person here
had something bigger than themselves
they were playing for. I've talked with a lot of you
about the work that I do. I've worked a lot
in immigration law. There's a lot of organizations
that I would want to make a donation to,
and I would also want to, you know, bet on myself and pay
for law school with this money. Thank you, Charlie. -Kenzie?
-KENZIE: I've been in my career
since I was 15 years old, not because it sounded fun. I would have loved to enjoy
high school like a normal kid. I couldn't. I started working in salons
when I was 15, got my beauty license
by the time I was 17, opened my salon
by the time I was 24. I opened it
to give people a place to work. I don't make any money off
of the chairs that I rent out. If a business person
looked at my business plan, they would lose their minds
and be like, ""You could make so much money
off of this."" It's not about the money. The
business is not about the money. It's about providing people
an opportunity. So this money
would be mine, for me. I would invest it and I would
set up myself so I don't have to be 70 years old
doing bang trims on kids, okay? -(laughing)
-Like, I'm trying to set myself up
to have a family and to be able to be
financially secure in myself. This was my venture.
My life is... has been for everyone else. -Q: Thank you so much.
-No problem. Q:
Yes, ma'am. Well done, jury. Every single question got different information. Well done. Thank you. Charlie, Kenzie, Ben, I'm gonna give you 30 seconds. -Okay.
-PROBST: If you think there was something
not brought up that is pertinent to your game,
this is your chance to make it. Charlie, 30 seconds. A pattern I wanted to highlight was ""never close a door."" Always keep my options open. Everyone here knows
that I've strategized with them at one point or another
in the game. It's what gave me options. It's what let me see my position
in the game, stay safe and have power. That's how I feel like
I got here today, and I really just wanted to hit
that point home to all of you. I think I played hard.
Thank you for listening. -PROBST: Kenzie?
-Thank you. KENZIE:
Oh, to sum it up, um, I went on every sanctuary reward
because I am a social butterfly. I competed
in every single challenge from the first one
to the fire-making. Won two of those,
thanks to some help, because you get by with a little help
from your friends. I came in here trying to make
friends, and thank you all for listening. Um... Yeah. I... I just love you all. Thank you so much. (laughs) -Thank you, Kenzie.
-Thank you.
-PROBST: Ben. Not that I think
it stacks up against them, but, uh, with everything
I've been through in my life, I did want to come here
and be the emotional me and not the bravado frontman
performer version of me. And even though
I had a hard time with the night terrors, I got from the bottom
and had fun climbing my way through moves
towards the end. I played the game I wanted
to play, and I'm glad I got to meet y'all,
because y'all rock, and... -Q: Thank you.
-Who rocks? -Thanks, Ben.
-You rock.
-You rock. TIFFANY:
Thanks, Ben. -I'll accept that.
-Right. The one, right? Come on. That's for you there. -(laughing)
-PROBST: Charlie, Kenzie, Ben,
it's not easy to sit in those seats
and defend your game, but you have to claim your victory,
and one of you just did. The question is who. The only thing left to do
is vote. -(laughing)

LYBALVI helps us push back against bipolar 1. Once-daily prescription
 LYBALVI is proven to treat manic
 or mixed episodes of bipolar 1 in adults, to help you
 push back. Elderly patients with
 dementia have increased risk of
 death or stroke. Do not take LYBALVI
 if you are taking opioids or are in opioid withdrawal. The samidorphan in LYBALVI can
 cause severe opioid withdrawal that can lead to
 hospitalization or increase risk of life-threatening
 overdose. Get emergency help if you
 have trouble breathing, become very drowsy with slowed
 or shallow breathing, feel faint, very dizzy,
 or confused or have a fever, stiff
 muscles, rash, swollen glands or problems
 with your liver, kidneys, heart,
 or lungs. Other serious side effects
 may include high cholesterol, weight gain, potentially fatal
 high blood sugar, uncontrolled body movements
 which may be permanent, dizziness upon standing,
 or falls. Are you ready? Ask your doctor about LYBALVI. Looking for co-pay savings? For info text “COPAY” to

47,1,One Glorious and Perfect Episode,"♪ ♪ GABE:
I want to be the very first head on the Mount Rushmore
 of the new era. AYSHA:
I am ready to forge my own path. ROME:
 I'm 100% gonna be writing
my own Survivor story out here. CAROLINE:
 Listen, I am either gonna blaze my own path out here or
I'm gonna burn down this island. SAM:
 I think I am dangerous
 in Survivor. I have what it takes,
 physically, but I'm versatile enough to fit
into different groups of people. You don't find a guy
 who looks like me be super unsuspecting, right? It's often the people that say,
""Oh, I'm a... I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing."" I'm a wolf in wolf's clothing. ♪ ♪ AYSHA:
 I march to the beat
 of my own drum. And no matter how nerdy it is, these are the things
 I love in life. But I don't do anything
unless I'm gonna succeed at it. (whooping) 'Cause I just don't like losing. I look like somebody
 who wouldn't hurt a fly, but they don't know,
like, I have a flyswatter in my back pocket. (laughs) KYLE:
 Growing up,
 life was a struggle, man. I spent five years in foster care,
over 26 different homes I lived in before
 I would graduate high school. I could have just flipped over
 and laid on my back, but I didn't. Life dealt me the recipe
 for disaster, and I baked
a ... brownie with it. PROBST:
 These 18 strangers will be abandoned
 in the islands of Fiji. TIYANA:
 I am the first native
 Hawaiian to play Survivor. I want to show that Hawaii can roll
with the big dogs. (howling) PROBST:
 They must learn to adapt
 or they'll be voted out. JON:
 I am sure that I have friends
 and family watching this right now. And I'm pretty confident
 that I know what they want for me out of this experience. They want me to suffer. PROBST:
In the end, only one will remain to claim
 the million-dollar prize. ANIKA:
 I'm gonna play hard. I might get a little evil.
 Who knows? (cackling) SUE: When I win Survivor, my final words will be,
 ""I'm 59, and I beat all your asses."" Who will have what it takes
to outwit, outplay and outlast
all the rest? This is Survivor 47. ♪ ♪ -(laughing, whooping)
-(clapping) You're here. -Oh, my God.
-Oh, my gosh. TK: I would say, looking
 at my fellow contestants, uh, I see a million dollars, man.
Like, I really don't think
 I see anybody on here who can do anything with me,
 to be honest. So, I'm ready to go. All right.
Welcome to Survivor 47. (whooping) -It's crazy.
-PROBST: So, every season of Survivor starts the same way, with the forming
of a new community. That's what's happening
right now. Take a look around. This is gonna be your community for the next 26 days. And the reason community has always been the foundation of this social experiment
we've been doing for 24 years is because humans
have always craved community. And I get it. If you're at home
watching Survivor, you could say
""Ah, it doesn't fully jibe. ""I mean, they're not
really abandoned. You're not really on your own.""
That's true. There are cameras
shooting you right now. But what you all
are going to experience because you're here is that when you're tired
and you're hungry or you feel left out,
it's gonna feel very real because you're gonna
have those same cravings for community. And what truly
sets Survivor apart from any other social experiment
like this is the game
that sits on top of it, a game that's
played with humans. The same humans you are
forming your community with are your adversaries. So you have to build a community with people you can rely on
while you vote them out and then
after you vote them out, you go back to them
and try to persuade them to give you the vote
for the million dollars. How do you pull off
that magic trick? So let's see if we can solidify
your community a little bit by giving you an identity
with a tribe name. We'll start with Blue.
Blue, you are Tuku. -Tuku!
(cheering, whooping) In the middle, Red, Lavo. -Lavo!
-(cheering)
-Yes. And on the end, Gata. -Gata!
-Gata.
-(cheering) PROBST:
All right,
so let's see if we can get a little personality
from our tribes. Guy in the front, in the middle,
what's your name? My name is Gabe,
from Baltimore City. What do you bring
to your community back home? I mean, when it comes to
working, I'm a grinder, man. I try to lead by example,
and I try to be the guy that says, ""I'm just
as tired as you are, but ""if I got energy to keep going,
I know for sure that you got energy
to keep going."" In the front, in the middle,
introduce yourself. Uh, my name is Teeny.
I know it looks like I'm from the Wild Wild West
right now, but I'm actually
a proud New Jerseyan. I feel like this is, like,
aggressively scarecrow, and, uh, that's not really
New Jersey's vibe, but, you know, I like to change it up
with, like, my style. Just to be clear, it's not like I gave you these pants. -These are your...
-No, I... I... It's my style. It's my style.
I own it. I'm just saying:
New Jersey proud. (laughing) PROBST:
Guy in the corner. -What's your name?
-Hi. I'm Andy. Andy, talk to us
about your role back home. What's your life about? Growing up,
I had, like, four friends. So unpopular because
I did not have an identity, and I kept trying
different things. I would wear
Grateful Dead T-shirts to be... pretend I was a stoner. I'm afraid of weed. -I can't smoke weed.
I can't do that.
-(laughing) I was a poser, right?
But I learned that I just have to be myself, and it's become a super magnet for everyone in my life
that I have today. -PROBST: Guy on the end.
-Yeah. -Introduce yourself.
-I'm Jon. I'm a podcast host, and I really care
what people think of me. (laughing) So much.
Four friends in high school? Must be nice. (laughing) PROBST:
Well, Jon, it's always so exciting to start
a new season of Survivor. So, what's the energy right now? You know,
I'm here in part because every episode you say,
""Apply to be on Survivor."" And you have this idea of what you would play like or what you could play like. And I think
we're all nervous because what we would play like
or could play like is about to be fact-checked
against what we will play like. -PROBST: Wow.
-And if you're cocky,
that's exciting. (laughing) And if you're not, it's not. (laughing) Well, shall we get
to the next phase? -(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: All right. Your first test as new tribes is waiting for you
in the jungle. -AYSHA: Oh, my God.
-Follow me. AYSHA:
Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. ANDY: Jeff walks us down the beach, turns a corner
 and takes us to... It could only be described as, like, a gladiator's arena. Look, I've seen a lot
 of Survivor. There are opening challenges, but this one
 really takes the cake in terms of the grandness. And the pressure is on.
 Like, you have to perform or you're gonna
be in trouble immediately. All right. Let's get to your
first challenge as new tribes. Here's how it works. Two players from each tribe are gonna crawl
 under a muddy net. You're gonna race
 into the jungle... ...and retrieve
 two puzzle pieces from one of three
 different obstacles. Then you race back,
 the next pair goes. Once you have all six pieces, two tribe members
 will use those pieces to solve a rectangular puzzle. The first tribe to finish earns their camp supplies. You know the drill. It's not much--
a pot, a machete and a flint-- but out here, it's everything, and will provide
a massive head start. The two losing tribes will have
to try to earn it another way. -Make sense? All right,
-Yup. give everybody a minute
to strategize, we'll get started. -All right.
-SUE: Let's go. Here we go. First challenge of Survivor 47. Survivors ready? (cheering) -Go! You're going out in pairs.
-(cheering) Get through that mud. Come on, guys! SIERRA:
Come on, Gata! That mud is birthing you
into Survivor right there. SUE:
Let's go! Yeah! (whoops)
Go, Caroline, go! PROBST:
There goes Kyle
in the lead for Tuku. Camp supplies on the line. Biggest head start
you can get in this game is the pot, the machete
and the flint. (cheering) -Let's go!
-(whooping) All right, here we go.
Let's go. -I'm on left.
-Okay, go. PROBST:
Working together
to free up these puzzle pieces. Got to get
all that rope through. -They're all spooled up.
-All right. Watch that one. -O-Over.
-Watch out. PROBST:
Once your pieces
are free, you can head back. These pieces are heavy. Sam heading back
with the first piece for Gata. SIERRA:
Come on, Gata! -(whooping)
-Let's go, Sam! -(overlapping shouting)
-I see you! Come on! Aysha has her piece.
Kishan has his. SAM:
Come on. PROBST: Sam's back to help. -Okay. Ready?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-PROBST: Kyle and Caroline still -working for Tuku.
-KYLE: Okay. How do you feel about it? KYLE: Keep going. SOL:
There we go. There we go. That's how you do it
on Survivor, right there! -(cheering)
-Let's go! Got to get back with both
pieces. Keep going, Aysha. You're good, Lavo. Head out.
It's Teeny and Genevieve. SUE:
Guys, get ready. -Go!
-You're good, Gata! Head out! Rachel and Jon. Go, Jon! Go, Rachel! PROBST:
You're good, Tuku. Head out. It's Gabe and Sue. CAROLINE:
Yes! Make it up. PROBST: Jon whipping that rope. Wow!
-This way, this way. -Okay.
-PROBST: Teeny and Genevieve
doing a nice job working together. Threading that rope through. Sue has hers, Gabe has his. -Tuku, you can head back.
-TEENY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Sue! Lok at that. PROBST:
Gabe heading back with a piece. Sue heading back with a piece. -Go, go, go.
-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Go! TK:
There we go, let's go! Let's go, Tuku! Get 'em back to the tower. You're good, Tuku. Head out. -Tiyana and TK. Whoa.
-Whoa! TK whipping through the mud. (overlapping shouting) You're good, Gata. Go! Sierra and Andy. PROBST:
Lavo, you got to keep moving. You're good. Head out. Sol and Rome. The last two. TK heads back to his team. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:
Sol heading back with
a puzzle piece for Lavo. Lavo's closing the gap
right now. Rome is free.
It's now Gata in dead last. Andy and Sierra-- they have
blown the little lead they had. Tuku with their final
puzzle piece. You're good, Tuku.
Start solving the puzzle. It's probably the, um...
Let's try it. PROBST:
It is Caroline and Kyle
for Tuku. That's gonna be an end piece? Solving a rectangular puzzle. Have to just put in... -All right, let's go.
-Lavo, you're good. -Start working on the puzzle.
-Oh. -Go, Gata!
-Come on, Gata! PROBST:
Here comes Andy.
He's got one piece. Gata still has one piece left. -Can you catch it?
-PROBST: Gata's dead
last right now. (grunting) Now you're good, Gata.
Start working. Rachel and Anika trying to make up
a lot of time for Gata, who are working together to solve a complicated Survivor puzzle, with tribe supplies on the line. We scoot it once.
That could go... here. PROBST:
There is no second place today, just two losers. -Yeah.
-Yes, and then that one there.
-PROBST: Gata now has new momentum. Anika and Rachel
feeling excited now that maybe
they have something sorted. -Yes, guys!
-Yep. -Yes!
-This one right here. -This one right here.
-Gata with a lot
of enthusiasm right now. Guys, guys, don't worry,
don't worry, don't worry. -Let's go!
-PROBST: Is this it? Have they solved it? -Yes, go!
-They got here last. Can they finish first? -Push it in there! Yeah!
-Put that in there! PROBST:
Put the top on. -Oh, my God.
-You got to get up. Why you never give up
in this game, ever. -Let's go! Let's go!
-Let's go! PROBST:
They got to get the top on. And they've got it!
Get to the top! -(whooping)
-PROBST: It's over! Gata wins tribe supplies. -That's it.
-(whooping) PROBST:
A lot of effort from Gata
to stay in this. -That was hard. That's no joke.
-No, that was tough. -GENEVIEVE: Good try.
-PROBST: Wow. None of us could get it. One, two, three. GATA:
Gata! All right.
Gata, congratulations. -(whooping)
-Tribe supplies are yours.
It's not much. A pot, a machete and a flint. But out here, it is everything. Come grab it.
Along with a map to your home. Gata, grab your stuff, head out.
You get the big advantage of starting work on your camp. SAM:
Thank you, Jeff. -Good job, guys. Good job.
-Thank you. -Killer. You were a killer.
-Oh, thank you. PROBST:
All right, Tuku, Lavo, no tribe supplies for you. You're gonna have
to try to earn them another way. Here's how it's gonna work. Each tribe's gonna choose
one person to take on this task. You're not gonna get any information
about what is required, so you're making a blind choice. How about rock, scissors,
odd man out goes? -Do you want to go?
-No. All right, who's it gonna be? All right,
Aysha's going for Lava. Tuku, how about you?
Make a decision? There's three people
that want to go, so that's why
we're gonna either throw a rock or scissors,
and then the odd man out goes. I love this! -Yeah.
-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors. -Geez.
-Not you throwing paper,
and we said rock first. Is that what you said? (laughing) TIYANA:
But, yeah, you're odd man out. Decision has been made. We have Aysha for Lavo,
TK for Tuku. You two are heading
out together. Head down.
Boat'll pick you up. Good luck. All right, Tuku,
map to your new home. -Thank you.
-Lavo, map to your home.
-Hey, yeah, baby. -Yeah!
-Grab your stuff, head out. -Good luck.
-Thank you. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Thank you, Jeff. ROME: Aysha chose
 to go on this journey, which-- props to you,
but big mistake. The social game
 is the biggest aspect of the game of Survivor, and I am not gonna miss out on those first few hours
of strategizing. It's so important.
 That's exactly how I'm gonna win the million
 dollars at the end of the day. St il l ha ve s ym pt om s fr om m od er at e to s ev er e ulcerative colitis or

Guys, I'm just so proud to be a part of a winning team. (laughing) JON: It felt like baptism
 by mud. Like, we're gonna win this challenge and
every challenge that follows. JON:
We don't really know each other,
 but this is a tribe that can win challenges
because we did. I live in Los Angeles. No, I started in WeHo,
where all the gays go. I was a speechwriter
for a while. -Okay.
-Whoa! And then I started a podcast -called Pod Save America. -Wow. JON:
 I was a speech writer
 for Hillary Clinton back when she was a senator
 and then I became a speechwriter in the
White House for President Obama. And now, when people
ask me what I do, I have to say that
I'm a ... podcast host. -Am I good?
-You're good. You're good. JON:
 When I was a closeted teen, I watched Richard Hatch
 win the first season. I ran around the house screaming about
what I had just witnessed. -JON: What should we do?
-ANIKA: Most important thing: -shelter?
-Yeah.
-Yeah. JON:
 And now, all these
 years later, I'm here. I feel a little bit like
the dog that caught the car. -So, something with a...
-A piece of bamboo across, like, that? -And then one over there.
-Yeah, something
with, like, a crotch. I am a numbers guy
 and that's how I want to play this game. Because I look at Survivor as ultimately, a numbers game. -Good? All right.
-Yup. ANDY:
 There are only six
 people on the tribe, but that constitutes
 15 one-on-one relationships. You could do the math.
 It's a pretty simple equation. It's a combination. Six, choose two, factorial equals 15. So if I connect with two people, it would actually be very hard
 to get voted out. ANDY: Because if I could
 count on two people to not write my name down, it would be very difficult
for four people to write my name down. Who has to come out
to their own girlfriend? And I'm like, ""Okay.""
And they're great vibes. But I'm just saying,
I just think, you know, we just have that... -We don't need to try.
-I love it. -I love it.
-You know what I mean?
-Unspoken. -Guys, like, unspoken.
-All right. (laughing) (laughing) SUE: I like your idea
of getting a shelter started. Let's do it. -The more we have,
the more comfortable we'll be.
-Yeah. TIYANA:
Not winning that challenge today actually sunk me to my core. Fingers crossed
 that TK comes through and brings back something good
for this tribe, because we're gonna
need it tonight. What type of vibe
are we going for here? Looking around at my tribe,
 I feel like we stack up incredibly well
in terms of physical strength. SUE:
You guys rock. This is crazy. (laughs) TIYANA:
 But puzzle-wise, we have some work to do. Tie? Uh, I mean,
at least for right now. If we find more,
we can always reinforce it. Coming into this game, I want
 to work with an older person. I want to work with somebody who's a little more mature
 because I got a bit of an old soul
in me, right? SUE: Uh-huh. What?! In my opinion, an older person-- they know how to operate
 without getting caught up in the social games of it all. That's somebody
who I want my day one, number one
alliance member to be. People are gonna be running
around with their heads cut off. People are gonna
be whispering at Tribal. When that happens... Thank you. Ditto. GABE:
 Let these kids gossip
and clique up among themselves. We'll run things in the shadows. Yeah. -Grandson. Aiden.
-Grandson. -Yeah.
-Aiden. How old is he? He's four. I love Caroline.
 She is literally the sweetest person
in the world. Survivor is really
my mom's and I thing. Now, see, it's me and Chelsea's.
Same thing, so you get it. She's so excited,
 and that's like my daughter, so, it's cool.
Like, there's something there. Yeah. Uh, what do you mean? You're the main person
that I feel, like, -I've got, like...
-Oh, good. -Oh, no, no, no. Exact opposite.
-Okay. At my age, I thought for sure I would be the very bottom. But now I feel
 like Caroline and Gabe-- they're-they're my number ones, and so I'm feeling good with it.
 Now we're gonna be a force
to be reckoned with. KISHAN:
 All right. We're just
 organizing them from, like, -Biggest to smallest.
-biggest to smallest so that it's, like, a nice incline. -I think this one over here...
-This one's got some girth. Yeah.
So, let's move this one. -Yep. -KISHAN: Losing that
 first challenge-- it sucks.
 We're not the tallest tribe. We didn't look to be
 the strongest, but Lava-- we're-we're resourceful. We just have to trust
our instincts and kind of fall back onto our training
and our, like, gut. So, that's what we're doing. Yeah! Like... KISHAN:
 I'm an emergency room doctor. I love the chaos. TEENY:
I think it's a dead hermit crab. We could eat it. Oh... Doctor. KISHAN:
 You're just
 constantly surrounded by the unknown, and I'm so ready for that,
'cause that's what I do every single day for a living,
and I'm really good at it, and I'm gonna be good at it

you make. In school, the one thing
 that I really excelled at was being able to make friends
 and talk to people. And so I'm gonna
 play this game by being every single person's
 number one. (laughing): Exac... Keyshawn and I bonded
 almost immediately. So, I mean, he's an ER doctor. He has an ability
 to work under pressure. And I feel like he's a bit more
introverted to my extrovert, so I felt like he was
a cool yin to my yang. I think she's
got the perfect vibe. -Yes.
-I think it's gonna be great. Us three stick together,
we're good to go. GENEVIEVE:
 The new era of Survivor is a very fast-paced game, and right now,
 I just really like Rome. -ROME: Oh, oh, I got it.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God, water! -(whooping)
-(clapping)
-SOL: Wow. GENEVIEVE:
I like him. I get along with him so well. He's so enthusiastic. I just feel happy
when I talk to him. Oh, that's so good.
Oh, my gosh. GENEVIEVE:
 I'm also trying to solidify
 something with Teeny. I would love
to have her as my ally. (gasps) Me too. Me too. I really like Genevieve. I want to play this game
 with her. But let's remember we have
an entire tribe member coming back here. (whoops)
My goodness. -So, TK.
-How you feeling? -Aysha.
-Nice to introduce me, -nice to meet... For sure.
-Yes. -This is wild.
-We have... Oh, my gosh. -Okay.
-You want to break it down? When I read that
 one person was going to get their camp supplies
 and the other was gonna go back to camp empty-handed,
my stomach dropped. This man looks like he currently is in the NFL. -So, on three?
-All right. Yes. -One, two, three.
-One, two, three. Whoa. Here we go. Okay. What am I looking for? So, when I uncovered the clue and saw that it was a picture,
 I realized this is my guide. I have to match the two to find the key.
 It's gonna look identical. Okay. Agua. I look at this map.
 I see the first X, and it's this huge rock face
 that is near. So I'm thinking,
""Just look for a big rock face. I'll find the X."" I look around-- there's, like,
eight rock faces. So, everything looks
exactly the same. This is this rock. It's saying ""between two rocks."" Ah, there it is.
That's what I'm looking for. That's it. (quietly): Yes! So, when I got my first key,
 that gives me the clue to be able
 to find that second key. A mountain of rocks. Okay.
This a mountain of rocks? Oh. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's... I get that first key
 and I'm hyped. Now I got my confidence.
Now I know I can do it. Come on, T, come on, T. (grunts) Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Yes! This is it. Perfect. I found my second key
 and I feel like I'm cooking, we're going, I have it. Okay. (sighs): Okay.
Come on, bro. It has to be over here. Let's see if it's right here. Here it is. I never would have thought that the final key was in the ocean. This is it.
 Whoever finds the fourth key wins. See, thi-this is the tree. Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, that's two keys.
 I'm hyping myself up like, ""They don't
 know who they messing with."" All right.
Three trees by theirselves. Come on, T. I don't even know
how to get back down. I don't even remember
where the path was. How am I--
I'm lost. I'm lost. Let's go. Let's go.
Now I'm getting my rhythm. Give me my money. Uh-oh.
Hold up. In the ... ocean is insane. Well, got to go back down, then. (grunts) Oh, my God, dude,
where is the exit? The forest is so dense. And I'm like, ""You know what, ""forget that path.
Make your own path, like you've done
your entire life."" I am about
to muscle through this. Oh! (whoops) I don't care what I hit.
 I'm making my own path through this brush
 and I'm figuring it out. Where is this thing? This is the path?
No, this is just where I was. I can't believe being lost is what's setting me back. It's to where
I can't get out of here because I'm lost? Where?
Come on, come on. Oh, I can't see
all the damn mud, dude. There we go. You got it? Oh... (sighs)
Hey, no, no, no, no. -Let's go.
-Oh, you got it? Let's go, bro! AYSHA:
 The fact that I was
 so close-- oh, it hurt. It hurt so much. TK:
 At the end of the day,
 there is honestly no better feeling in the world
than seeing this pot and machete and flint. (whoops) And it's because of me. So, I'm gonna
take the credit on that. Nice little pat on the back. (laughs) Ooh! AYSHA:

-RACHEL: No. Sprouted coconut. So, basically,
it's, like, when a coconut falls to the ground
and starts growing a new plant. If you catch it at specifically
the right time and you crack it open,
it has, like, this fluffy, -foamy, like,
good-textured coconut.
-RACHEL: Oh! -So, that might be a good thing.
-And there's one-- No, it's a great thing.
And it's over there and it's growing, and we
can all, like, have dessert. JON: Anika is just prepared. She's a prepared person. She watched
 a YouTube on coconuts and she spotted
 a sprouted coconut, which is a trendy food in Los Angeles and also available in Fiji. The first base-- we'll want it
off the floor, right? So, we have to dig four holes. Even though I told myself before coming out here,
""Do not take the lead,"" I'm a project manager
 true at heart. My head cannot help but say, ""Hey, guys, these are the steps ""that need to happen
 in order to get ""from A to Z. Let's do that."" We're gonna need
way more bamboo. -RACHEL: Okay.

the glue guy around for too long in this game, you end

wrestle me for the key. And I'm like,
""Whoa, wait a minute."" Hey, all good, man, all good.

 Oh, my gosh, when TK arrived at camp, the guys flocked to him. Where you from? PG county. -Really?

gonna-I was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.
-Really? -Yeah.
-GABE: Hell yeah, dude. -Hell yeah.
-TK: That was good times
over there. CAROLINE: The guys fell in love with each other the moment
that they saw each other. KYLE:

-Yeah. We got a lot

that connect to and from. CAROLINE:
 I'm not an idiot. I can tell. It's a bromance. GABE: Yeah. TK:
Hold on. I'm-I'm gonna
pull it with you, though. Hold on one second. Oh, hold on, here we go. I'm just pulling it this way.
There we go. GABE:
 Oh, my God. At the base
 of this really big log, I see a Beware Advantage staring
back at me, and then I kind of lean on top of it and I just put my hand over it.
 You know, instantly, I start calculating
 in my brain, ""How can I get TK
 away from this? I'm not totally sure I want to bring him
that deep in quite yet. Luckily, TK leaves
 and I just get a chance alone. Once I make the decision to take it, that is set in stone. This is something
 that I want to move on fast. And a note says... ""You will dig up a box
that contains ""everything you need
to claim an immunity idol. ""Until you take possession
of the idol, ""you cannot participate
in the vote at Tribal Council. That's why it says 'Beware.'"" I realized that
 the branch where I found the Beware Advantage was right on the path. And then, lo and behold, found this box
 with a lock on it and a tube, which has more instructions
 on what to do. It says... ""Unbraid the vines to release
the key that unlocks the box."" And of course I know
 what the rock face is. It's a massive,
 massive rock base right next to our tribe's camp. So, I know I have to bring
 what's up there down to me with these vines. I can see the key wrapped around the ring on the top
 of this rock base. My precious!
There it is. GABE:
Do you want to find out? I'm such an idiot. -You want to help me?
-Yeah. GABE:
 Right away, I was like,
 let me not play coy. Let me just bring him into this right away and say, ""Let's
find out what this is together."" That's a key, dude.
Dude. That's probably for the... We found a key before we found anything else. That doesn't sound right.
 Like, that's not adding up.
 So, in my mind, I'm like, ""I caught you in the act
but you weren't gonna ""tell me about this,
so maybe we aren't as close as we thought we were."" GABE: I kind of feed TK this story
of ""I just found it"" and I think I he bought it. Yeah. I finally have this key
 in my possession, and I-I really
 need to find time to return to the box, but not be
 too hasty about it, because it just leads to mistakes. AYSHA: Riding back to camp with no camp supplies, I was so fearful. I'm just thinking, ""I haven't just disappointed
myself in this moment, but I've disappointed my tribe."" Hello. Oh, Aysha! -Aysha!
-KISHAN: Yeah! -Okay, story time, story time.
-Oh, my God. AYSHA:
 I knew that the only way to approach talking to my tribe
was being honest. I literally had nothing to hide. Um, we arrived to the beach, and there's this stand and the instructions say
there are two paths and only one tribe was gonna get the camp supplies. TEENY:
 Being a Survivor fan, I've listened
 to Aysha's podcast before. It seems like she's very bright. She picks up on a lot of things
that even I miss from the show, and that could
 be helpful for my game. -Well, thank you for going.
-GENEVIEVE: Thank you
for trying and going. I was like,
""Oh, it was for nothing."" TEENY:
 So, the first thing I did
 was pull her aside and say, ""Listen,
I think I know who you are. -Okay.
-And I... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right, right, right. So, I don't plan on... -I would never tell anybody.
-Okay. -I just wanted to tell you.
-Thanks. So, when Teeny approached me about recognizing me
and knowing me from Rob Has a Podcast, that made me so nervous. But I really do feel, like,
a genuine connection with Teeny. I'm just trying to make sure
that I'm not blindsided by... good vibes. SOL:
Yeah, Lavo. -TEENY: Yes.
-(Genevieve laughs) AYSHA: Everyone playing
 the game of Survivor is here to win
 a million dollars, and so I'm trusting everyone until they give me a reason
 to lose trust. Who knows
what's about to happen? AYSHA: Yeah. -Oh, for real?
-Mm-hmm. Ah.
Seems like my whole tribe likes me, which is good. I said that
 when I start this game, the main thing that I want to do is immediately start looking
 for advantages and try to do it
 in the smartest way. It is hard,
in this new era of Survivor, to look for these advantages
and not get caught. I need to go this way. I don't know. I just-- I... I feel like we just-- Yeah. ROME:
 On day one,
 looking for an idol-- that could put a huge target
 on your back. But at the end of the day, I want to play this game
 as hard as possible. So I have to make sure
 that if I'm looking, I am looking everywhere, and if I look everywhere, I feel like I'm-a find it. (gasps) I didn't even
 see the word ""beware."" I just see the word ""advantage."" That's all it is.
 Because guess what? That advantage is gonna be in my
hands instead of someone else. It said right there at the path, you'll be able to find a box with everything you need
to get your idol. Oh, my gosh. Once I started
 to dig on the path in the broad daylight, that was when I realized,
""This is not a good idea."" Thing is, it's right there
 where everyone's walking. It's directly
 on the way to the well. And so I almost
 have to do this at night. I just feel
 absolutely incredible at how I'm playing the game

understandably so. -Let's run into it.
-(Caroline whooping) -TK: Yes! Let's go!
-CAROLINE: Let's go, Tiyana! (whoops) GABE:
 But I've had a lot of time to be excited.
 Now's not the time to be excited, now's the time
to take care of business. It's why we're here.
It's what I plan to do. I found a key earlier today to unlock this box
 buried in the ground, but TK walked up and caught me. And now I'm realizing
 I need somebody to keep an eye out for me. And Sue was somebody
 that I could work with to actually accomplish the tasks that were at hand. When he told me he found
 the Beware Advantage, that was huge. Like, I never expected
anybody to ever tell me that they found an-an advantage. -All right.
-Okay. He'll be coming
from what direction? Okay. So, I'm definitely
 gonna be the lookout for when Gabe goes off hunting
for this advantage. ♪ ♪ The fire's doing good. GABE:
 I hear from Sue, and I have no more time. I grab that lock that's
 hooked on the box and I just rip it out of the ground
 as hard as I possibly can and I just take off sprinting. Let me just get off this path
as soon as I can. Wow. Oh, my God.
 When I open it, I find a second box
 within the first box. And I'm not happy about it. I broke my neck
 to get this thing, and now it comes with this big caveat. It's only good
 for one Tribal Council. If you want to keep going,
 there's another task, and that will give you
an idol that's good for three Tribal Councils. I fancy myself a gambler
 in real life. I like betting on sports,
I like going to the casino. Scared money don't make money. So I put the one-time-use idol
 inside the smaller box and I took the clue,
 and it says, ""Follow the map
to the driftwood. ""Break open the driftwood
to find the key that unlocks the box."" So, I realize I have
 to hide this box somewhere and figure out what the next step
of the equation is. That did not sound that great. (sighs) I don't even know
what's happening up there. I couldn't even possibly guess
what he was doing up in the rock mountains? GABE:
 I am just panicking
 and-and panicking. My heart rate is pounding. I had a rough start
 to this game. I sit here with no vote,
 no idol, a whole task to do. It's gonna be a very mentally stressful

'cause you... Vine was awesome. That's right.
I was still a young person. JON: Looking at my tribe,
 I'm realizing I'm not getting to know
a group of people. I'm getting to know

-Yeah. Also, I learned this thing I read. My stepdad
was like, ""You're gonna die out there."" He gave me,
like, this survivor book for Christmas,
and if you hold your fingers up to the bottom of the sun, -every finger's 15 minutes.

Mine was a book. -SAM: It was on the Internet.
-It was hard copy. ANDY:
 I first saw Rachel, and I just knew she was someone that
I wanted to hitch my wagon to. I feel like
we've got, like, two hours. Okay. All right. ANDY:
 Right now, I feel like
 I trust Jon and I'm working with Jon,
 but that's it. And that makes me uncomfortable,
 as a numbers guy. Yeah. Let's go. So I really put it upon myself
to find an opportunity to get a moment with Rachel. That's awesome.
I feel good about you, too. We're... in alignment.
We're synchronized. I agree. I'm like,
""You're strong. I'm strong."" -Yeah. Yeah.
-I feel like it's good. Part of the appeal
 of Survivor to me is that I love games, and Andy is just the sweetest, but I don't think
 he's strategic. -...in a minute. -RACHEL: He just, like, is a little too eager, maybe, to, like, just to bond and to get to know each other. You have to be careful, though. -Maybe not tomorrow.
-Yeah, yeah. -I'll follow your lead.
-Okay. RACHEL:
 It's super suspicious to get up early
and meet on the beach to talk. Like, absolutely not.
I am not doing that, Andy. ANDY:
 I couldn't sleep. I wasn't sleeping at all. I was just in these sort of
 negative thoughts, feeling like, in this
 new community, I'm somewhere where I don't belong. And I just needed
 to talk with someone, someone I felt good about
 because I feel like... I am spiraling, in a way. -It's just that I...
-No, like, you don't
even need to say. Like, someone definitely knows
we're here, -and so, like, that, actually...
-Yeah, you're so right. RACHEL:
 One of the things
 a Survivor player shouldn't do is go off to talk.
 This is really obvious. People just heard us
 in the shelter. All right,
do you want to sit or what? RACHEL:
 And I just literally told him, ""That's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do that."" And then he does it anyway. It doesn't make me more confident that he's going
to be a good alliance member. ANDY:
I just can't sleep. -I just need to talk.
-No, no, you're fine. -No, tell me.
-I thought I would come in here and be a little different
than I am. RACHEL:
What did you think
you were gonna be? I thought I was gonna
be the version of myself that, like, I feel like I am today, but -feel like I'm going
a little bit backwards.
-Yeah. He's feeling insecure, and I totally empathized
 with him, but you can't take those moments
 of downness and then just kind of rip
somebody else's ga... game and pull them down with you. -We need to get the fire going?
-ANDY: Yeah. RACHEL:
Make coconuts first, then fire, -'cause we need to eat.
-Right. ANDY:
 Rachel's someone
I felt so good about on day one. -Thank you for doing this.
-Of course. ANDY:
 But I tried opening up
 to Rachel. I thought that would give me a sense of relief, but I don't feel like
 I got that closure at all. And that put me
 in a very difficult and negative headspace. ANDY:
Right now. I feel like I've felt very often in my past. RACHEL:
Yeah! ANDY:
 Sort of a high school feeling, like I'm different,
 I stick out in a bad way with a group of people all enjoying
 each other's company... RACHEL:
You're so accurate.
That's really hard to do. -ALL: Oh!
-That's a good-ass coconut. ANDY:
 ...without me. -SIERRA: Yes! Give me some.
-That was beautiful. ANDY:
 When I'm cracking my coconut, people aren't even watching me. Jon-- he cracks a coconut and there are cheers
 from everyone else at camp. And I had this gut feeling I am on the bottom. This could be my last day
playing Survivor. -JON: It could be any of us.
-I'm going crazy. I'm the least popular
on this tribe, and it's okay. It's okay. JON:
 I feel like I'm in a really
 good place with Andy, but there's some anxiety

 of driftwood out on the beach that has a key inside of it that
will open up the second box that will then give me
 the three Tribal idol. And the clock is ticking. So the X on the map
 says it's into the brush, and lo and behold, there's
 a piece of driftwood there. I know that there's
 a key inside of it, so, I just smash it
 like I'm Donkey Kong. (groans softly) Every slam of this driftwood-- it's deeper than
 just getting this key. This is giving my vote back. Who knows how much time I have
 before people get up, and I don't know if I'm gonna
 have another opportunity to keep looking for this thing. Come on. Oh. Come on! (sighs) Bingo. So, now that I finally have this key in my possession, I'm exhausted, but I can't wait to get back to the box. (sighs) There's a catch.
 There's a third box within the second box. It never seems to end. Leave it to Survivor to just not let me
take a breath. This was a tough call
 I was making, but this has been so damn hard. I'm really excited
 because I have power again. I have my vote back. I'm a dragon sitting on top
of a pile of gold. -Personally love him.
-Yeah, personally love him. -Yeah, I hear you.
-Yeah, truly. SOL:
 I-I really think
 he has something. Last night, I dug up a box. There was a gigantic lock
 on the box, and then I found the scroll, and I knew there was no way
 I was gonna be able to read the scroll
 in the pitch black. And so, today,
 I walked away by myself so I can read this advantage
and do the next step. ""Soak... soak the drift..."" That's so random.
Okay. All right.
I can do this, though. Once I got that second clue, I realized, ""Okay,
 this is absolutely insane."" But, man, if I can find this
and get this done fast, that'll be awesome. All of a sudden,
 I heard a twig snap. I look up,
and Aysha's right there. Hey. Huh? ROME:
 Granted, I don't think
 she saw me pouring water on the driftwood, but she saw me
looking really, really hard. -And...
-Like, fully, like... -Fully looking.
-Okay. Where was he looking? AYSHA:
By the rocks. We need to see
if he's still over there. Rome is playing amateur hour. He's searching for idols,
 and he's a complete liability. Rome is off his rocker. (whispering):
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. The key to the box ""is at the bottom of the well."" When I read that,
my heart dropped. (grunts) It feels so, so difficult. You can almost feel like
 Jeff wants someone else to be able to know,
 he wants someone to catch me. I got the key. I know
 that the key unlocks the box. I'm hoping that
I can go open this box up and that there's gonna be an
immunity idol right inside it. (quietly):
Here we go. What? AYSHA:
 Me, Teeny, Kishan
 and Sol saw Rome at the water well. And he goes the other way. No, ""Hi."" No,
""Hey, what are y'all doing?"" Like, that is just
 suspicious behavior. -Yeah.
-Should we just keep going? TEENY: Mm. Yeah. AYSHA:
 I have this huge fear of Rome having an idol. I think that's great. AYSHA:

that he wants to stay and he values
the relationships he's building. But he knows that
in a situation like this, you may have to turn
on people you care about. PROBST:

Jon and Andy expect me to throw a vote on Anika tonight. Love you, Jon,
 but I'm not doing that. I'm starting to think Jon is playing hard. -JON: We can make this work.
-SAM: Yes. -I got it, right?
-Okay. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go. He's a strategist. He's very, very smart,
 which is dangerous for me. And Andy is strong. He might be able to help us win a challenge or two. ANIKA:
I know we're at a point in the
game where we need strength, but will we actually
win more with Andy? Because he is messy and not only
in his words, but, like, -all he is is brute force,
and it's not even
-SIERRA: That's so true. -that strong a force. -SIERRA: Having somebody like Andy can be a liability, and it's somebody we definitely
 need to worry about. However, I think
 right now we need strength. I don't think these challenges
 are going to get any easier. We need some strength
and, honestly, we're not getting that from Jon. I think we need to touch base
and get on the same page. -Yep.
-Yeah.
-SIERRA: We have to be quick. We need strength right now. I think that makes sense.
Right now, I would vote Jon. RACHEL:
I still really worry about Andy imploding again.
Like, yesterday was a bad day, today's a bad day. He's given up
halfway through the challenge -before we even lost.
-ANIKA: Mm-hmm. I just think there's legitimate
pros and cons to both. If we keep Andy, I think he's more loyal
 to me than he is to anybody else on our tribe. But I don't know that
 that's actually a good thing because Andy is a ticking
 time bomb and you don't know when it's gonna explode. On the other hand, if we keep Jon, who is
more even keel and levelheaded, we might lose the next
 few immunity challenges without Andy's strengths. I am genuinely torn. Our ability as a tribe to make the right choice
 is gonna decide the fate of Gata,
 and that is so scary. ♪ ♪ If y ou ' re l iv in g wi th H IV , imagine being good to go

Go ahead and grab a torch, dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council
because in this game, fire represents your life. Fire's gone, so are you. And that will be the case
for one of you tonight. But before we get to the vote, we got a lot to talk about. It has been a roller coaster for the Gata tribe. Sierra, give me an idea -of camp life.
-Oh, my God, Jeff. I mean, my back
feels broken, my legs feel broken, I have bruises,
and it's been three days.
I mean, Jeff, I have the Survivor 101 book at home.
I have 25 coconuts in my backyard,
machetes. My neighbors definitely
have a lot of questions about who's living next door to them. But I do have to give props
to Anika. I mean, she definitely led the tribe
for a good bit. She had the basics and got us, like,
a good base start. PROBST:
Anika, walk me through that. How did you step up
to be the leader? So, I'm flattered
that you think that. Um, I had general consensus
and a general idea of what we should be doing,
realistically. -How would you
describe camp, Jon?
-JON: I think we spent the first three days finding commonality. You're doing that
because you genuinely want to. There are genuine connections, those are real,
you can't fake it. And even if you wanted to,
I don't think you ultimately could succeed unless you were,
like, a sociopath. And so, yes, we're a community,
but we're also competitors. And I think a little bit
out of fear and trepidation, people really were reluctant
to break out into groups and start
having strategic conversations. So, a bit of a delayed start
to the strategy part? Uh... yes. PROBST:
All right, let's get
into the emotional part of the first three days, Andy, -all circling around you.
-Yeah. Today at the immunity challenge, what stood out to me were the comments you made
about your tribe. -Yeah.
-""Nobody noticed me
open a coconut. Nobody likes me.
Everybody wants me gone."" Walk me through that
a little more. Well, I feel like I grew up on the outside, 100%. I never felt like I belonged, but coming into this experience, I felt like I changed just by getting rid of all this, like, need to please people. PROBST:
So, you're saying,
in your recent life, -Yeah.
-just back home, you felt like you've broken out
of that feeling left out. -Yeah.
-And do you feel like
you have a community? An unbelievable community
has formed around me, and it did not happen overnight. It was because
I challenged myself. I kept saying yes to things. I kept putting myself
out of my comfort zone, and succeed or fail
based off of that. PROBST:
So, it's fascinating -that you would work so hard
-ANDY: Yeah. and then sign up
to take on the biggest test -Yeah.
-of social resiliency anybody could
ever volunteer for. ANDY:
But I've made myself
ready to conquer that. And now I can go show,
you know, the world, any-- everyone in my life,
you know, how far I've come and how, you know,
easy it will be for me now, which is not the case,
as we can see. PROBST:
So, Jon, regardless
how it played out today, do you respect the fact
that Andy's intention of coming out here was to try
to take on this social test? Um, did Andy have a moment? People have moments. Sometimes they happen
on a beach in Fiji. People shouldn't be judged
by their worst moments, even if you are frustrated
that they're saying it -in front of everyone,
including Jeff.
-(laughs): Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.
-JON: So I don't think
any of us came away from that not being frustrated. PROBST:
So, let's talk about that. Andy, you shared
a lot of information. -Yeah.
-It'd be very easy to say, -""He's a loose cannon.
You got to get rid of him.""
-Yeah. PROBST:
So, when you get back to camp, -what did you do?
-I want to be very, very clear, and I was clear to everyone. I think it was pretty obvious that there was absolutely
zero premeditation. That old part of me just set in
and that paranoia, and now look
at these five people who Andy threw under the bus. -You only threw one person
under of the bus.
-Well, yeah. With my words.
Yeah. But despite all this, the one thing
I absolutely cannot do is say that it's okay
to vote me out. Let's just play Survivor. I will accept the result. So, Sam, what was the fallout from a strategic point of view? Because you don't want to come
back to Tribal Council again, and a lot of that is gonna
be harmony and tribe strength. I never had a perception of Andy that he was out here to do
anything other than give 100%. He fought so hard
in the challenge that he's passed out
on the side. But then he's willing
to turn on his best friend. Well, that's hard for somebody
to jump into bed with. Rachel, can Andy
recover from today? I-I... I empathize with
Andy completely, but what if he goes
on a journey and says whatever he's thinking,
which-- who knows-- you know, what plans
he has that I don't know about. But Survivor does that to you. Like, everyone has
those moments of like, ""Is everybody just
lying to me right now?"" PROBST:
Jon, it's interesting that playing out right now
is everything we talked about
at the marooning. The idea of building
a new community where you can feel safe in it, but then you put on top of it
the game. So, how confident are you
about the vote? I don't know
what kind of conversations would have taken place
if Andy hadn't drawn the... the evil eye.
I-I really don't know. But when you know that there's all these different
conversations going on and that there is
a natural target, it really starts
to make you wonder, who's the unnatural target? Could I be trying
to find that person? Could it be me? ♪ ♪ PROBST:

-JEM: I agree. The girls think that
 one of the guys might have
 the immunity idol, but I found a Beware Advantage, and it's a clue to the idol. And nobody suspects
 that I have anything on me because I put the Beware
 Advantage in another tree to kind of get the scent off of,
that somebody already found something. Where's the damn scroll? JEM:
 It's been
a wild goose chase, and finally, everybody knows
 there's nothing there. And that played out
 to my advantage, because now the women
 are on the same page. Either Ben or Tim
are gonna be the next target for us, and then the three girls
 are running the show. This is a beautiful place

Four, five, six, seven. Pause. (laughing) CHARLIE: You know,
 the salsa may seem goofy, but it's all
part of the strategy, if you think about it, you know. It's going to be very important
for me to really be in lockstep with my number one ally, Maria. And so, let's switch partners. CHARLIE: We're trying
 to walk the tightrope of the middle of this tribe,
 and you've got Tim and Ben on one side
and Jem and Moriah on the other. So Maria and I
 are really in control. I don't think anyone knows we're really working
 closely together, and that's so powerful,
so I want to keep it that way. (all cheering) LIZ: If everybody's looking,
 I guess maybe I should look. Just got a feeling
that I'm not gonna find it. There's just so many
nooks and crannies to scour. -Mm.
-While we're here... HUNTER: At this point, getting so close to the merge, everyone's worried
about the idol. Everybody's searching
 for this thing. Soda is very blatantly
 looking around. Tevin's out there
 with the shovel, digging. You get that little surge
of excitement when you see something,
and then... (blows raspberries)
...nothing. I have spent so much time
 looking for this idol. I've been digging
 and climbing and, like, going all over the place. I feel like I'm walking by it, and, you know,
 the camera pans to it, and ping, there it is,
 but you don't see it. This jungle is so huge, and there are
 so many small crevices. I want to find the thing, but
 it's just like, ""Where is it?"" TEVIN:
 I don't know what the hell
 going on with the idol. I don't know
 if there's more than one, if there's two, if there's
 three, if there's none. So I don't know
where to even look. And no one seems
 to have found it. I think every person has looked
 for the idol except Liz. LIZ:
I'm just sitting at the shelter. I keep telling people,
 ""I'm not gonna look."" I'm not gonna
search for an idol. I can barely find my shoes. SODA:
 Looking for an idol
 is just so difficult. It is so dense out here. It's almost impossible to scour every little inch. There may be one coconut
 you don't turn over, but there's, like,
 a million coconuts. It's exhausting. And at the same time, we don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands. VENUS:
What is that man looking for? I'm gonna go spoil his fun. An idol. In my mind, it's day ten, and I'm pretty sure
that sucker is found. And I guess I was wrong
in assuming you found it. This advantage has really weighed on my mind
because I know Randen found it. And he was medevaced
 with that Beware Advantage in his pocket, so, it's probably
 back in the game. Hunter knows this island
 better than anyone, so, Hunter,
 if you're finding that idol, I will find it with you. I-I'm shameless.
I will literally follow you. And if I'm annoying you,
I don't care. It would be near a landmark, no? I don't know. I mean, in
the other season, it was, like, tied to the top of a bush,
and then, in, like, those little cracks
of those things. And so, I think the era
of the landmark has kind of, like, passed. Yeah. HUNTER:
Venus keeps following me around as I'm looking for an idol. So, I automatically
 just sit down and stop searching. I don't want her
 to know if I find it. Realistically, Hunter, if we do
go into any kind of merge, we have to pick out
who the biggest threat is. People might be thinking you. Okay, but you don't think that? No, I do, but I... So you want
to vote me out today? I don't because
I consider you a meat shield. HUNTER:
 Come on, man. I know that
 I am a huge challenge threat. That's why I'm looking
 for idols and stuff. I wish she would just
leave me alone. Can you believe
we're halfway through and we haven't even
started playing? -It's unheard of.
-It's pretty fun. Thank you. -I'm rooting for you.
-I'm rooting for us, for Nami. After our really cagey, awkward conversation, Venus finally decides
to leave me alone. And then I can get back
to really looking. So much time spent looking
for this stupid thing. And then I see it--
 the Beware Advantage. It's about time. Oh, golly. Forget that.
We're looking at it. I know being the biggest
 challenge threat is making a target on my back. So I snatched that thing up
as fast as I could. ""Dig directly below the spot where you found
the Beware Advantage."" Well, I started digging,
 and I find a big old box, and the box has a lock on it, but there's a little scroll
 on it. And it says, ""There is a hidden
immunity idol in this box, but the box requires a key
to open it."" Oh, boy. ""The location of the key
 will remain a mystery ""until after your tribe loses
 a future immunity challenge. ""Once your tribe loses, ""return to this location
to receive further instructions. ""Until you have taken possession
of the idol, you cannot vote
at Tribal Council."" I do want to have this idol, but now I have to wait
 until my tribe loses? Looking at the performance
of the other tribes, it doesn't look like
it's gonna happen very soon. Thankfully, there's a clause
 that says if we don't lose, I still have an opportunity
 to get it. I know that I am in trouble
if the merge hits. I know that I need
 as many weapons and tools as I can have
 going into it, and so, this could be
game-changing for me. KE RE ND IA pr es en ts t he A BC ' s of C KD . C is for Chronic,

the whole time. I got one number one
out here, and that's just real. TIFFANY:
Absolutely. Q:
Hey, have you noticed, when Kenzie walk up, the first
thing she always asked is... (laughs)
Yeah, I noticed that. What are y'all talking about? Oh. What are y'all talking about? TIFFANY:
Chopping up wood. What are y'all talking about? TIFFANY:
Coconuts versus papayas. What are y'all talking about? Q over here telling us
to write his name down. It would be devastatingly hard if we go to another
 Tribal Council, especially for me, because Kenzie's expecting me to vote Q and Q's expecting me
to vote Kenzie, which puts me
 in a really tough position. It forces me to have to choose
between my two tightest allies. So I'm praying we don't have to go back
 to Tribal Council so I don't have
 to make that decision. MORIAH: We just need
 to get this fire going. MORIAH: Yeah. Hmm? I don't...

so I don't know, like, whether or not to be concerned. I'm talking to Tiki Man. Oh. TIM:
 But I feel good nevertheless. You know, it is what it is.
It's Survivor. And I'm just trying
to see it through for my family. TIM:
Somebody moved
the Beware Advantage. I'm trying to figure out who. Somebody lied
and made me dig three feet. That would be the dickest move
to make people dig -for three days.
-MORIAH: Yeah. -And give 'em no...
-And kill a tree. TIM:
 I have no idea who put it there to play with us.
 These people are nuts. I'm talking about my tribe.
Siga is nuts. Like, right now,
 we're all suspects. I do feel like I trust Ben. We vibe, we're hanging out. ♪ Brotherly love. ♪ TIM:
 Same for Maria. The parent connection

-Yeah. And Charlie. I think
we're a really strong four -going forward.
-Yeah, I think so. TIM: I have a feeling
 about who did it. So I'm excited about
putting the pieces together. How you moved
the Beware Advantage? What Beware Advantage? I don't know about that. -So you don't have an idol?
-I don't have an idol. Why are you freaking out? I feel... I feel...
You're gonna make me upset. I really feel like
I'm on the bottom. Don't get u...
Nobody's on the bottom. I don't believe her.
 Jem's, like, acted weird. Ugh! I don't like it.
I do not like it. Somebody moved
that Beware Advantage, yo. I think so, too. TIM:
 I'm not-I'm not sure,
 but I think she's fooling me
and everybody else. You and Mo not tight?
So who you tight with? Just me? -I hon... Can I be honest?
-Yeah. I don't feel like I have, like,
a very tight relationship with anybody, so I don't know
what's going on in your head. Tim's coming at me
 so hard for information, but I'm a fantastic liar.
I just found it out. 'Cause usually,
 at home when I lie, I giggle. And, like,
 my husband knows when I lie. But I haven't giggled at all.
Like, I just lied. What are you thinking...
if you had to vote? We are. Bros are tight. Ben and Tim think
 they're running the show, but the girls have control,
 which is great, 'cause when
 you're playing this game, it's either you or them,

Getting your first look
at the new Yanu tribe. Bhanu voted out
at the last Tribal Council. All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge? -Yes.
-(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: First things first. Got to take back the idols. Thank you, Moriah. Tevin, come on, give it up. -Jeff, please.
-Don't make me take it. -(Tevin laughs)
-Scary. Once again... immunity is back up for grabs. TEVIN:
All right. PROBST:
For today's challenge, one at a time,
 you're gonna race through a massive,
 three-level obstacle course, collecting keys along the way. Once everybody's at the finish,
 one person will use those keys to unlock a long hook. You'll use the hook
 to release sandbags. You will then race to fire those
sandbags at a series of targets. First two tribes to finish win immunity,
safe from the vote. In addition,
playing for a reward. Want to know what's playing for? -Yes, please, Jeff.
-(all voicing assent) -SODA: Food.
-I think you're gonna like it. -SODA: Food.
-TEVIN: Please. (all cheering) Oh, Jesus Lord, my God. I told you. PROBST:
Pastries and fruit... -TEVIN: My God!
-SODA: I called it. PROBST:
...for the first tribe
to finish. For the second tribe to finish,
a smaller sampling -of the same thing.
-TEVIN: That's all good. (applause) (indistinct chatter) Last tribe to finish,
otherwise known as? ALL:
The losers. I thought they might say Yanu. (all groaning) -Jeff, come on!
-That's crazy, Jeff. -Jeff, don't be dirty.
-TIFFANY: That's crazy. Wow.
-Shady. -I'm just saying.
-You're so sassy. PROBST: Last tribe to finish,
Tribal Council where somebody will be the fifth
person voted out of this game, and as a penalty for losing,
I will keep your flint. Yanu, you are still working
to earn yours. And I would like
to take a moment, because we love records
on Survivor. Yanu, you have endured longer
than any tribe in the new era without your flint-- 11 days. That is a record. And if you lose this challenge, you will hold another record. The most immunity losses in a season in the new era. Wow. PROBST:
If that's not inspiration, I got nothing for you.
All right. Let's get to sit-outs. Nami, sitting two people out. Cannot sit out
in back-to-back challenges. Tevin must compete.
Who's it gonna be? I'll sit out. PROBST:
Soda and Liz gonna sit out. All right, Siga,
Jem and Maria must participate. Who are you gonna pick to join? -It's gonna be Tim.
PROBST: Tim. So Moriah, Charlie and Ben
gonna be the sit-outs. All right, sit-outs, take a spot
on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize.
We'll get it on. Let's go, Yanu! ♪ ♪ All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? -Go!

There goes Venus working her way
to that second bag. My little woman stick bug. -Jem going for the second bag.
-(overlapping shouting) Q has got a lot
of time to make up. -KENZIE: You got this, Q!
-PROBST: He's trying to get Yanu back in this. They have yet to win an immunity
challenge this entire season. (indistinct,

-TEVIN: Let's go, Venus. -You're good.
-PROBST: Venus has
her second bag. KENZIE:
You got it, Q! PROBST:
Q with his first bag. -KENZIE: You got this, Q!
-BEN: Let's go, Jem! -(whooping)
-PROBST: Jem has her third. -You're good, baby. Come on.
-PROBST: You're good, Siga. It's gonna be Tim
working the rope. You're good, Nami. It's gonna
be Hunter on the rope for Nami. First you got
to find the three keys and figure out
which one unlocks your hook. TEVIN:
Good luck, baby. PROBST:
Q working on that third bag.
He's got it. Got to get down. You're good! It's gonna be Q. HUNTER: Is that it?
-TEVIN: Nothing but luck, baby. PROBST:
Now Hunter
has his hook unlocked. He can start
working on the rope. Tim still looking for the key. Here's the opportunity
for Yanu to get back in it. And just like that,
Q has the hook for Yanu. They got a shot. Still looking for
their first taste of victory. You've got to untwist that rope.
All of it. TEVIN:
Few more, baby. -BEN: Let's go, Tim!
-CHARLIE: You got this, Tim. PROBST:
Tim finally has his hook. It is Q, Tim and Hunter trying to release that rope so they can
release their sandbags. TIFFANY:
That's awesome. Yes. (indistinct shouting) Hunter drops for Nami. They can start
collecting their sandbags. Tim has the bags undone. You're good, Siga!
Start collecting those sandbags. -PROBST: Q still working
on that rope.
-TIFFANY: Same thing. Just reach out further. Come on! PROBST: You got
to get all your sandbags. -Wow.
-CHARLIE: Jem, you're so quick.
Let's go! Once they're all in there,
you're good. -You're good.
-BEN: All right, Maria! PROBST:
Here goes Tevin. The massive Survivor slingshot. Looking for three targets
to knock down. SODA:
So proud of you. You got this. Just misses! LIZ:
Come on. Try again. Q still working on the rope. Yanu is dead last again, which is a common story. -LIZ: There you go.
-Tevin again. Knocks down the first target
for Nami! Everybody's got
to hit one target. TIM:
You got it. Nice shot. PROBST:
There goes Maria.
She misses. It's Venus now for Nami. Venus knocks down a target
with her first shot. Nami down to one target left.
It's Hunter. Maybe give yourself
a little slack. PROBST:
Q has released his sandbags! You're good, Yanu!
Let's go! -VENUS: Hunter, you got this!
-SODA: You got this, Hunter. TEVIN:
You got it, Hunter.
Right here, for the win. PROBST:
There it is, for the win! Nami remains undefeated. ♪ Nami, Nami, Nami, Nami. ♪ We're looking for one more. Can Yanu get back in this? Siga has not knocked down
any targets yet. Here goes Tiff. And she connects.
Yanu has their first target. BEN:
Maria, you got this! PROBST:
Maria just misses. -Here comes Q.
-(overlapping chatter) Jem for Siga. And she does it.
We are tied, one-one. PROBST:
Anybody could win this
right now, including Yanu. Yanu either gonna
break a losing streak or set a record
for the longest losing streak. There goes Kenzie. And she does it! Nami has two!
Maria hits her second
right on the heels of Kenzie. And it is a showdown--
Tim versus Q. One target left
for both Siga and Yanu. For the win right here. -Tim, no.
-Okay. -PROBST: Q... no.
-(contestants groaning) Right there! You're right there! This is the greatest playoffs
of the century. Both guys quickly reload,
but Q is way ahead of Tim. BEN:
Come on, baby, Celtics, baby! PROBST: There it is! Yanu wins their first immunity challenge
of the season... Hey. PROBST: ...sending Siga
to Tribal Council -for the first time.
-(overlapping chatter) -We did it!
-Yeah! Ah! And that is what
a victory looks like on day 11 for Yanu. Smiling faces. Fire! Thank you. TIFFANY: Yes. Nami, once again,
congratulations. (whooping) -Thank you.
-Immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Nami. Yanu, for the first time
this season, the immunity idol
is coming to your camp. -Thank you.
-Along with it, -your flint.
-(whooping) First time in 11 days. Mwah. -(Kenzie whoops)
-That should be
a game-changer, Kenzie. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, this is amazing. PROBST:
Let's just take a moment, since you have been winless. What is that feeling right now, Tiff, to be holding that idol? Honestly... (exhales) it feels so good, but all I can think
about right now is that I'm not gonna wake up
freezing cold tomorrow. It's been so hard
sleeping without fire for the last 11 days.
Like, brutal. I'm just... I'm so happy, Jeff. PROBST:
Kenzie, what's the feeling? It's been a very long
losing streak for Yanu. KENZIE:
This feeling is new to us. All we really know is losing, and we have lost
half of our tribe. So the fact that
we get to keep us together, like some semblance of Yanu
moving forward, it's... You know, we were preparing
for the worst this morning. We were like, ""What if
we have to go down to two?"" Because that's all we knew. So this is just
a little bit of security in a game
where we haven't had any. All right, Nami,
you also won reward. Large tray of pastries and fruit will be
waiting for you back at camp. Yanu, a smaller tray
of pastries and fruit will be waiting for you
back at camp. Siga, different story. Tribal Council tonight, where somebody from your tribe will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing,
you know what's coming. Sorry for you,
I'm gonna take your flint. ♪ ♪ All right,
before I send you on your way... journey. -(gasping)
-Oh. Nami, you are
in charge of who goes. Just like last time,
one person from your tribe, one person from Siga,
one person from Yanu. Who's going from your tribe? -I'm gonna go.
-PROBST: Hunter's gonna go. All right, who from Siga
is gonna go on this journey? Any volunteers? All right, Tim's gonna
go on the journey from Siga. And you've got the Yanu three. We're gonna let Q go. PROBST:
All right,
so it's gonna be Hunter, Tim and Q on the journey.
Grab your stuff, head out. You will return back to camp
before Tribal Council. Nami, grab your stuff, head out. No Tribal Council.
Nobody going home. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Good job, Nami. -TEVIN: Thank you.
-SODA: Thank you. Yanu, grab your stuff. I know you won't
miss me at Tribal. -Sure won't.
-PROBST: Head out,
enjoy the night off and that well-deserved reward. Thanks, Jeff.

vote before a merge, possibly. -If we get to the merge...
-TIM: Yeah. the physical threats-- it-it's only really three of us. We gonna have to stick together,
regardless. And the only thing
that I can think of is, if you get

-TIM: I'm solid on this... Q:
 Hunter, myself and Tim are the biggest threats,
physically. So we agree that
 the three of us pick one person on our tribe, and let's go to the final six. I think that's a good plan. -Want to read this?
-TIM: Let's do it. It's a Survivor knowledge test. We have to decide, as a group,
who will go do this Survivor knowledge test
 and risk not having a vote. I'm a superfan, and I'm confident in my ability. However, my vote is way too valuable tonight at Tribal Council, so I don't want
 to play the game. Y'all superfans? -I'm a pretty big fan.
-TIM: Yeah, yeah. Are you-are you a superfan? If you're a pretty big fan,
I don't know, you might know
some more knowledge than I do. -Q: You'll definitely
know more than me.
-Yeah. -I'm comfortable
with you going, bro.
-HUNTER: Okay. -Best of luck, man.
-We'll see what happens. -Thank you.
-Good luck, man. HUNTER: The journey is awesome because you have an opportunity
to meet people and, you know,
 whatever connections you can have, I'll take. And now, if I can get
a big advantage from this, it would be amazing. Oh, boy. Okay. Let's just see what all we got. The journey is an opportunity
 to test my Survivor knowledge. There's this long table, and you've got
 to put 20 Survivor logos in chronological order. I'm a pretty big fan, but when I watched Survivor, my college roommate was the one
who introduced it to me. And he just
showed 'em to me in order of seasons that he likes,
not in chronological order. And so I was like, ""Oh, boy. This is not gonna be easy."" Well, we know that one. But I recognize Borneo, season one. Boom.
 First one right there. Let's just start
putting these in, at least. I recognize quickly Pearl Islands because you have Sandra
 and you have Rupert. Yes! HUNTER:
 All from Pearl Islands. That was number seven,
right before All-Stars. We know Parvati
played in Cook Islands, before Tocantins, because Parvati had won
by Heroes vs. Villains. And so we know
 it's Cook Islands and then Caramoan. We keep going.
 I remember Tocantins, which is Tyson,
 like, my favorite player. I just always smell
like flowers and exotic fruits. HUNTER:
 You have Redemption Island, where Boston Rob and them -come back. -You gotta hustle if you want to make a dollar. HUNTER:
 I love those seasons, so
 those were pretty easy for me. Kaôh Rong is, like, the one where Caleb passed out. Panama was before Cook Islands. I think I've been
 doing pretty well. But, also, it's just fun
 to walk down memory lane and be inspired by all the other
people who have played before. Eight was All-Stars. But if this is number seven,
that's not possible. So we have to figure out
where I'm missing something. Golly.
This is gonna be impossible. Why didn't
I watch them in order? I can look at these logos
 and say things that happen in the season,
 but it wasn't questions about what happened
during the season. It was a question of the order. There's a big gap here.
What happens between here? This is 28. This is 22. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. But as you sit there, your brain's not
 functioning at full capacity because you haven't slept well
 and you haven't eaten well. And so you're like, ""I really need you
to, like, really kick in and tell me the order."" Ooh. Golly. Also, there's this timer
ticking in your head, and you're like, ""Did Debbie
come back for a Second Chance or did she come back
for Game Changers? It's nauseating,
frustrating and I'm pissed! HUNTER: Pretty sure she came back
 for Game Changers. And so, as the timer's
 running out, I am as content
 as I'm gonna be. But, you know, if I miss
even one of these things, then I lose my vote. Feel good about these
right here. I mean, that could be the order. Oh, dear. Time to flip. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. (laughs):
No. No. No. No. I got-I got those way off. There, there,
there, there, there. And then switch those two. Not great. Eight out of 20. Not great. That is not a passing grade. I lost my vote because I didn't
know the order of the logos. Which sounds terrible, but if this whole plan works with Q and Tim-- the brochachos,
like, the meathead thing-- that's good for my game. Those connections
 going into merge could be worth
 a million dollars. Always risky to put yourself
on that boat and take a journey, but that's what

idol hunting.
-Just go do your thing. -Okay.
-All righty.
-MARIA: All right. Think everybody goes and does -whatever they want to do.
-MORIAH: Yeah. JEM:
 Oh, my God. I don't have
 a vote for tonight's Tribal. And as soon
as we lost that challenge, it just, like, hit me. I have to go back
 to the place where I found the Beware Advantage, because
 now I get more information to find the key for
 the immunity idol in the box. Oh, my God. Like, this is crazy. I have to go back to camp, get the machete
 to go measure stuff, and I know that I have to do three different tasks.
 And I'm like, ""The tribe is right here. Like, how am I gonna
get away with it?"" CHARLIE:
All right, dude,
I'm gonna head out there. (whoops) JEM:
 I have to figure out
 how to get my immunity idol before tonight's Tribal Council or I'm gonna lose my vote. Every time I walk this way
 or walk that way, I kind of
 see people in the path. And I was like, ""Jem, you got to go.
This is your moment."" I have three different places
 to measure. The tribe's flag. I need to also measure the perimeter
 of the tribe's boat. I added it up, and it was 12. Tree mail. And then finally
 the perimeter of tree mail. And it's four. ""Boat times logo
plus tree mail."" 12 times two is 24, plus the four is 28. I need to go back to where I originally found
 the Beware Advantage and measure 28 machetes
 out towards the beach. Fear crept into my heart. I'm looking to make sure
 nobody's coming. And then I was like, ""Okay. Let's go."" (quietly): Please, please,
please, please, please. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Hooray. I found it. I dig up a rope with a key. And that was the moment I knew that that's the key
to unlock that box. And emotions,
 like, overwhelmed me. (imitates musical flourish) This is my dream
 coming out here, to find an idol, and I did it,
and nobody has any idea. Now I got to make sure
 that the women plus Charlie are still going strong, so there's no way tonight
that Ben or Tim is not going home. Hu rr y an d ho p in to K oh l' s for great Easter essentials! Get Sephora beauty

So what do you think
Tim is gonna come back with? He's for sure
coming back with something. And I think
he already has something. -So how
do we want to vote today?
-MARIA: I don't know. How many votes? I've got two. -I feel really strong.
-I think we put three on Ben -and two on Tim...
-MARIA: Yeah, two on Tim.
I agree. -Let's lock down on that.
-MORIAH: I like that. -But let's talk to Charlie.
-MARIA: Okay. We have to go
 to our first Tribal Council, which means get
my extra vote from the journey. And I'm willing to use it
because Tim potentially has an idol,
 you know? So I think
 we have to take out Ben, and I think we're four strong
 with Charlie, and so the plan is very foolproof. Maria's pretty confident
Tim has the idol. So that's why
we're gonna put two on him. -So he plays his idol,
and then Ben goes home.
-Yeah. Okay. Ben is the target. Bam. It's like
my heart plummeted in a second. I've gotten very close with Ben
 over the past couple days. Yeah. I'm... I know. It sucks. But he's a really big threat. -Like...
-Mm-hmm. CHARLIE:
 People are talking about Ben
 as a big-time social threat. He's a magnetic guy. He's charismatic. He's funny.
It's true. You know, people like Ben a lot.
 I like Ben a lot. And I want to keep him around, because, ultimately,
 Ben is an asset. MARIA:
You're back! (whoops) -Let me tell you
about the-the journey.
-Let's hear it. So, the journey is whoever knows
the most Survivor knowledge. Hunter says he'll do it, and so-so I'm not doing it. -Nothing happened.
I didn't get anything.
-BEN: Yeah. I didn't play.
I didn't get anything. JEM: In my gut feeling, I feel like
Tim is not being truthful about the journey. And so we want to vote Ben out,
 'cause that's just an easy vote,
just in case Tim has something. I know that
 Tim doesn't have the idol. I have it. I'm gonna be bringing it
 just in case I need to use it tonight,
 because I'm so worried. Like, Ben and Tim
are up to something big. So I have
 to find out what their plan is for tonight's Tribal Council. -Look, I'm the judge.
I got the gavel.
-Listen... -Listen, I know...
-Uh-huh? ...you and Tim have
a really strong relationship. -Everybody says that,
but you don't... we don't...
-Listen... -Yeah.
-This is Jem, okay? Okay? Okay? -So this is not...
-If you only knew
what we laugh about. -I don't care
what you laugh about.
-Okay. -But I want to be part
of the laugh is what I'm saying.
-Okay. I don't know, dude. -You're holding a machete.
(laughs)
-Honestly, -but, like, whoever you want
to vote for, like, let me know.
-Yeah. I will vote with you,
whoever you guys think. -Please, tell me, honestly.
I'm all about honesty.
-(laughs) -Yeah. -BEN: Jem corners me. She's trying
 to get some information, 'cause she's gunning for me.
You just know when you know. She's holding the machete.
 So I grab the hammer. I'm, like,
 trying to hold my space. -Tonight is do-or-die. Yeah.
-I know. It's do-or-die. And I will not flip. -I'm looking you
straight in the eyeballs.
-I know. I'm not blinking,
and I wouldn't flip. -Trust in your gut.
-It's, like... She's like, ""Go with your gut."" And my gut is telling me
 Jem's playing at all costs and if we keep her around,
 she's just gonna screw us at the next vote,
because she's so, like... It's chaos mode. And I know she's approached Tim,
'cause I saw it and I heard it. Let me know who to vote for,
and look at me. I will vote with you. You're not looking at me.
Tell me what I got to do. BEN:
I'm just hoping we take Jem out. The problem is, nobody knows
I don't have a vote. -Jem's in chaos mode.
-TIM: Yeah, I bet. I had to grab the hammer 'cause
she was holding the machete. And she goes,
""You know I'm loyal. Like, you know
we can work together."" And she just
keeps interrupting me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. BEN:
 Me not having a vote,
 it definitely blows. But, like, Jem-- she's kind of, like, made everybody
feel a little bit on edge. She's on endgame mode. But if you come into a game
 like this already thinking about the million dollars
and you're not thinking about every step along the way,
you're never gonna get there. -Jem confronting
all of us like that...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now, potentially,
you don't have a vote? BEN:
Just assuming
I don't have it, right? If you, Tim and Charlie
stick on Jem, it's still a majority. CHARLIE:
 Maria and I have been
 playing the middle the entire time
 we've been out here. I go back and forth.
I think Maria goes back and forth. And right now,
 we're at that crossroads. Okay. Just tell me
where your head's at. -(sighs)
-(chuckles softly) We can go with the women--
 Jem and Mo-- or we could go with Tim and Ben
 and with the men. This is the thing
that makes me nervous is, I heard you saying that
you're feeling close to Ben. Just, like, you feel
bonded to him, and... So I'll tell you
where my head's at with Ben. We need threats in front of us. -He's a shield.
-Yeah. And he is a charisma
rock and roll shield. MARIA:
 Clearly, Charlie's more keen on working
with Ben and Tim, but, you know,
 trust is a big deal for me. I think working with Jem and Mo, we have a much deeper amount
of trust. Like, I don't... I don't trust Ben and Tim. I have flip-flopped
like a kid on a seesaw, because I think that Jem will be loyal to us
 down the line. We have to think long-term. CHARLIE:
 Jem and Ben both have reasons
to catch votes tonight. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay. All right.
-Let's do this. Jem's playing really hard,
 making people be very wary of her. So you don't hit me
with the machete. CHARLIE:
 Ben's strength is his humor, but that's just as dangerous
as it is fun to be around. Tonight, we find out
the alliances. MORIAH:
Line in the sand. CHARLIE:
 At Tribal, there's
 no more flip-flopping. It's all about Maria and I putting our cards on the table
 and not looking back. And all of a sudden,
 you've got six people who yesterday were hunky-dory,
 dancing the salsa, and today, we're scared out of our minds
that our dream's gonna end, you know, no more salsa. CO VI D- 19 ? I'm not waiting. If it's COVID, PAXLOVID. PAXLOVID is an oral treatment

dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council because in this game,
fire represents your life. When your fire's gone,
so are you. That will be the case for
one of the six of you tonight. So, Ben, the upside
of not coming to Tribal until day 11 is obvious. All six people
are still in the game. So what do you do,
from an individual standpoint, when you all share
one thing in common: you've never been to Tribal? Definitely feels
like some Ozzy Osbourne -""going off the rails on a crazy
train"" in every direction.
-(Moriah laughs) Everybody, I think,
is sussing out a vibe. We've been calling ourselves
""the vibe tribe"" since day one,
and now the reckoning has come. Maria, how does it impact
the first Tribal when you've spent so many days
relying on each other, surviving in the jungle, and now
you got to vote somebody out? I think this is the time
where we rip off the Band-Aid. And this is gonna hurt,
doing it at day 11, I think, than having to do it
at day two or three, because we gel so well together. -We're even dancing together.
-Yeah. Yeah, we learned how to salsa
dance from Maria yesterday. It's like being
at a retreat sometimes. -Wake up, shred the aqua dump.
-(laughing) -Then everybody's, like...
-Yeah, normal retreat, yeah. -Just to clarify,
we do not aqua dump together.
-Yeah. MORIAH:
That's the one
solo activity we do. But it feels like we're living in Survivor la-la land. JEM:
Jeff, it goes like this. ""I'm low on water.
I want to go to the well."" -""Okay, we're coming.""
-Five hands. And all six of us walk
to the water well and to tree mail. We go to bed together, we wake up together. -PROBST: Well, Charlie?
-Yeah. What all of that equals to me is
massive blindside tonight. I'm no math guy,
but it seems like you've got the equation right. You know, we don't have
a Hunter or a Q. How we survive is by
being scrappy, by being gritty and working together.
That was necessary for us
to all get to day 11, but we're starting to feel
the heat for the first time. It's not just smoke. There's
a whole lot of fire around here. PROBST:
Moriah, was there
much talk about -idols or advantages
in the game?
-MORIAH: Oh, yeah. There's the possibility
of an idol out there, and I don't know
how many votes may be at this Tribal at this point. People may have zero votes. Some people may have two. There may be four extra votes
cast tonight. Actually,
I'm really bad at math, so that doesn't totally add up
to me right now. But I get your point, is that
there's this uncertainty -because of journeys
about who might have what.
-Yeah. Yeah. MORIAH:
Yeah. And then, we're a hot mess when it comes
to, like, Beware Advantages. We've had, like, a laundry list of debacles over at camp. CHARLIE:
Jeff, Maria found what we assumed
was a Beware Advantage. All the advantage says
is ""dig down."" So we get digging, and we get
digging, and we get digging. And then we rip the whole
tree up, and there's nothing. And all six Sigas have been
pouring a whole lot of energy into a whole lot of nothing. -Over three days,
-Emphasis on ""hole."" PROBST:
So, Maria, what's the conclusion that you've come to? -That you haven't found it?
-MARIA: Well, that's a really
good question, Jeff. I think that it must have been found
by someone else before me. Yeah. So, Jem, you're in
an interesting dilemma as a group of six because
you formed these relationships, people that you like
and want to work with. So was there any debate for you about who you wanted
to vote out tonight? I'm sitting here
and I am lost for words because I'm still
trying to think who I might want
to put on the parchment. And there's no name
that's coming up. Like, can I write
your name down? -(laughing)
-You can't write
my name down, Jem. I'm here forever. Sorry. Sorry. Permanent immunity idol. So, Tim,
what is about to happen? Because even right now,
everybody's smiling and yet a name will be written down, and I'm guessing
one of the six of you are going to be
very surprised it's you. -Am I right?
-You're absolutely right. But we might just
all be playing a very, very good game
right now so that nobody feels targeted before we all start
marching up those steps. Maria, that rings very true. It does.
I think that we all, deep down, know
what we're gonna write down. I think all of us are lying by saying we don't know
what we're gonna do. Jem, do you think
that's a group feeling or is that just
where Maria's at? I think nobody
wants to rock the boat. Just thinking about it,
there's so many options, right? If you want to move forward
in this game, you have to be able to,
like, trust the alliances you made right now. Ben, is it possible that
tonight's vote does more damage than just one person going home 'cause you can no longer
trust everybody? BEN:
I mean, that's always
a possibility. I know I'm still getting
a Siga tattoo either way. You know?
We've all talked about it. But, um, yeah, obviously, you never know
if somebody's gonna feel like they were on the bottom,
and if we get to another side, why would I want to work
with those people in the merge? So you never know, but
that's the thing about Survivor. One vote,
one challenge at a time. Hopefully,
you get to your long goal. PROBST:
Charlie, how will this tribe be different
after tonight's vote? CHARLIE:
I think it's a test of can this tribe face a loss
and still be the vibe tribe, or is the vibe tribe a mask
that we've been wearing and after tonight, it's been ripped off
and it's not coming back? MARIA:
But I think, Jeff, that at the end of the day,
we have to separate emotions and game. Easy to do? Very difficult to do. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Tim, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'm so scared and so nerding out
at the same time. BEN (whispering):
No vote. We'll see how it goes.
All right. (whispering): ""...is when there
are six players in the game."" I'll go tally the votes. If anybody
has an advantage or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Ben. Jem.
One vote Ben, one vote Jem. Ben.
