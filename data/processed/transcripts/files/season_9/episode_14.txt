         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 18
Americans began the adventure of
a lifetime.
(tribesmen shouting)
They were marooned at a tribal
village on the remote island
nation of Vanuatu.
In ceremonial fashion, the
castaways were divided into a
tribe of men and a tribe of
women.








While the women were forced to
watch from the sidelines, the
men were given the opportunity
to retrieve a traditional spirit
stone used to ward off evil
spirits.
You have to get it from atop
of that pole.
If you fail, the women get it.
The rivalry between the men and
the women had begun.
(tribes cheering)
 I think the boys got a
lot more out of that ceremony








than we did, so we're out for
blood now.
 PROBST: Survivors ready, go!
At the first immunity challenge,
the men's Lopevi tribe had a
solid lead over the women's
Yasur tribe.
 Get her through! Get her
through!
 PROBST: But Chris couldn't
make it across the balance beam,
and the women won immunity.
Back at camp, the young guys
wanted Chris out.
 It has to be.
 PROBST: But Sarge proposed a
strategy to keep the older men
in the game.
 The only way we have
survival here is if we get rid
of the young people.
 PROBST: First person voted
out of Vanuatu Islands of Fire,
Brook.
Sarge's plan worked.
Perceived as a physical threat,
Brook was voted out and Chris
was saved.
For immunity, go!
At the second immunity
challenge...
 Straight, Bubba, right there.
 PROBST: ...it was the men who
came out on top when Sarge led
Lopevi to victory.
Lopevi wins immunity!
 Say my name!
 PROBST: When Yasur went to
Tribal Council, Dolly was their
first victim.
 If you were not here, we
would still have fire...
 PROBST: On day seven, Mia and
Twila had it out over the work
ethic.
 You stay here five minutes,
then your asses go down there
in the ocean, bitch.
 It's your only card,
keep playing it.
 PROBST: Mia's temper cost her
a shot at a million dollars.
And at the next two Tribal
Councils, Lopevi lost John P.
and Brady.
 Holy...
 PROBST: On day 11, an
earthquake shook the island.
 Ride 'em, cowboy!
 PROBST: And the shakeups kept
coming.
Sarge, Scout, over here.
Sarge and Scout were chosen to
pick new tribes, mixing up the
men and the women.
Julie and Twila ended up as the
only two women on Lopevi, and
Rory and Bubba ended up as the
only two men on Yasur.
Twila and Julie fit right in
with the guys of Lopevi.
Sarge even made a pact with
Twila.
 So we need someone that knows
what it means to give your word.
 I do.
 PROBST: But at Yasur, Bubba
was uneasy.
 Being in a tribe with a bunch
of women, it does make you
nervous because one wrong
move, and they'll vote you out.
 PROBST: So at the next
immunity challenge, Bubba tried
to signal his old tribemates.
 Think about the merge.
 PROBST: And Ami caught him
red-handed.
 He's making plans with
the other team.
Can you see Michael Jordan
whispering over to the other
team what their next play is?
Hell, no.
 PROBST: Bubba got axed.
Bubba, the tribe has spoken.
 There we go.
Oh, that's what I like.
 PROBST: It was becoming clear
that Ami was running the show at
Yasur, and on day 15, the tribe
followed her lead when she
decided to vote out Lisa.
The tribe has spoken.
At Lopevi's next Tribal Council,
Julie and Twila joined the older
guys and sent John K. packing.
We're now one tribe.
On day 20, the tribes merged.
Rory rejoined his old buddies
and immediately let them know
that Ami was a threat.
 As soon as we got over
there, they are like "Rory,
you're gone next.
Ami told us that."
 PROBST: So the guys once
again put their faith in Twila
and Julie when they planned to
vote out Ami.
 We got the numbers,
we'll be good to go.
 PROBST: But the men were
shocked when Twila and Julie
betrayed them.
The women joined forces and
took out Rory.
The men were outnumbered and in
big trouble.
Sarge was next, then Chad,
leaving Chris as the last man
standing.
Let's bring in the people you're
going to pair up with.
Come on in.
 Uh-oh.
 PROBST: When the survivors'
loved ones joined them for the
immunity challenge on day 27,
Chris told his fianc√©e Laurie
that he had to win.
It was a close race, but with
the help of her girlfriend
Crissy, Ami won immunity.
 Yeah, baby.
But back at camp, everything got
turned on its head.
 We made our decision.
 All right.
 PROBST: First, the women
decided to vote out Eliza before
Chris, and Twila made a bold
commitment to stay with Ami and
Leanne to the end.
 On my son, I swear.
 PROBST: But Twila went back
on her word when she approached
Chris with a plot to take out
Leanne and Ami.
 I'll turn the tide.
I'll take the risk right now.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council, it
all came together when Eliza and
Scout joined them and voted out
Leanne.
The tribe has spoken.
The women's alliance had
crumbled.
 Screwed you, didn't I?
 You didn't screw me.
I'm still in the game.
You screwed Leanne.
 PROBST: Suddenly Ami was
fighting for her life.
 I'm competing with all
my heart now.
It's me all the way.
Room service!
 PROBST: When Ami joined Eliza
and Chris on a spa reward...
 Good night, Chris.
 PROBST: ...she did her best
to get Eliza back on her side.
 Every single time I've had
your back, every single vote
I proved it.
 PROBST: But Chris was also
working on Eliza.
 We're pure final four
and look at our competition: a
60-year-old woman and Twila.
 PROBST: Chris wins immunity.
Chris won immunity and was safe
for three more days.
 Good job, dude.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Ami kept fighting when she
when she confronted Twila about
swearing on her son's name.
 I can't imagine.
 I am not the only
freakin' person that has
lied in this game.
Get over it!
You've been had. Screw you!
 PROBST: Eliza had a big
decision to make.
Would you miss Ami if she
was gone?
 Yeah, I'd miss Ami a lot.
 Stop crying.
 PROBST: But when the votes
came in...
13th person voted out of
Survivor: Vanuatu...
Ami was finally dethroned.
Chris had come a long way, but
he knew the game was not over.
 It's probably in my best
interest to go with you and
Eliza.
I'm kind of playing Julie and
Eliza; at the same time, I'm
playing Scout and Twila.
They're all women.
How do you trust any of them?
 You know Scout and Twila
are not going to go against
each other.
With the two of them, meaning
a hundred percent we do not get
to the final two.
 PROBST: The heat was on, and
no one was safe.
 What's up?
 I don't know.
You tell me.
 I think you're a liar, T.
 Who else has been lying?
 You've been trying to
plot against me since day one.
 You're driving everybody
friggin' nuts.
Now, Chris, what are you
thinking?
 What?
You know, I'm just laying here,
you know, in the hammock.
 PROBST: With tensions boiling
over, Chris made one last move
when he guaranteed Julie his
loyalty.
 What I'm comparing this to is
my friendship with you, compared
to my friendship with Twila.
 PROBST: Both Julie and Eliza
believed Chris when he said
Twila would be the next to go.
 Chris has proved me right
so far, and I just hope he
continues to do so.
 PROBST: But at Tribal
Council...
14th person voted out of
Survivor: Vanuatu...
Eliza was shocked when Chris
betrayed his pal Julie and
helped vote her out.
Now only four remain:
Chris, Eliza, Scout and Twila.
Tonight, they will compete in
their final immunity challenges.
Two will continue on to face the
jury.
One will outlast all the rest
and become the sole survivor.
(theme song playing)
 I voted off Julie tonight
at Tribal Council, took Eliza
by surprise.
Oh, well, Julie had it coming.
She pulled a fast one on me
after the merge, I got her back.
It's all in good game.
 This is, this is, yeah,
this is hard for me...
knowing who to trust.
 It's part of the game, Eliza.
Not everyone plays it that way.
 I know, but I would never
say that I thought that somebody
who was still here didn't
deserve to be here.
 I don't think you
deserve to be here, Eliza.
The only reason you're still
here is because you've been
riding everybody's coattails
from day one.
That's the only reason you're
here, period.
 That's not true.
That's blatantly not true.
 You have done nothing
for the camp.
You've done nothing, but boil
freakin' water.
You don't deserve to be here in
my eyes.
 Well, T, I don't think
you deserve to be here.
I think, you know...
 At least I've played
the game and worked hard.
That's more than I can
say for you.
 Working hard is not
necessarily playing the game.
Conserving your energy and
kicking ass at challenges.
Who's won the most rewards of
anyone here?
 Well, you might as well have
all your strength to do that.
 Yeah, well, maybe that's
how I'm playing the game.
If you conserved your energy,
maybe you could do better at
challenges.
 God dang.
 Probably not, but maybe.
 Probably not, you're right.
The only reason you're here,
Eliza, is everybody has used you
up to this point.
That's the only reason.
 I think Twila is a dumb
bitch.
I mean, I just don't want to see
either of the two of them make
the final two.
I just don't want to see it.
It just kills me if that
happens.
 Julie wasn't the answer.
That's all there is to it.
 Now, tomorrow, assuming you
still... are going to stick
with an alliance to me...
 That's never changed.
What I did today was for our
alliance.
You'll see, okay?
 I believe you.
I believe you.
 Why wouldn't you?
Have I ever lied to you?
 No.
 Julie was a player, Eliza,
a player.
She didn't give a ... about you.
She gave a ... about you
when her neck was on the line.
She voted for you, remember?
 Mm-hmm. I know.
Yeah, but...
 You think you can get one
of them to turn on the other.
 Mm-hmm.
 I don't know.
I don't think much about any of
the women here since the final
seven of us were here.
I mean, they are all just
playing the game.
They turned on each other, and
they all got their own opinion,
and Eliza and Twila don't like
each other, I love it.
It puts a little bit of, you
know, excitement in camp.
 I thought I would be here
on day 37, yes, but if you would
have told me that this was the
group of people I was going to
be with, I would have laughed
in your face.
I never would have imagined that
this would be the final four.
 I guess we could get that
manioc on.
If we don't, we ain't gonna get
to eat it.
 Because there's only
four of us left, it's pretty
clear, you know, who is going to
stick together and who is going
to vote for who at tonight's
Tribal Council.
Scout and Twila have been
wanting to vote for me for a
very long time, and I think that
would give them a lot of
satisfaction to finally do that,
so I really need immunity to
stay in this game.
If I don't get immunity, I pray
that it's Chris who does.
 PROBST: You guys ready to get
to the challenge?
 Absolutely.
 PROBST: First things first.
Give it up, Eliza.
Immunity back up for grabs.
Today, you will take part in the
first ever Survivor vertical
maze.
You'll make your way up and
through this maze collecting ten
pairs of wooden tiles, one pair
at a time.
When you've collected all ten
pairs and you have them at your
station, you'll untie them to
reveal ten letters.
Use the letters to form a two-
word answer.
First person to solve this
correctly wins immunity,
guaranteed spot in the final
three.
You guys ready to do it?
 ALL: Yeah.
 PROBST: Wait for my go.
We'll get started.
For immunity.
Survivors ready... go!
Chris and Twila in first.
Eliza right behind.
Scout going to give it a go.
Chris going up high.
Twila going down low.
Remember your color.
Twila back with her first pair.
Chris has his first pair; he's
got to get down now.
 Where did they go?
 PROBST: Eliza having no luck.
Twila at her second pair.
That helps Eliza who just
follows right behind.
Eliza out with her first, Twila
out with her second, Chris
out with his first.
Scout, she has her first pair.
Eliza with her second pair,
Chris with his second pair.
Twila, Chris, Eliza all with
two pairs.
Twila got her third pair.
Twila racing down with third
pair.
 Watch out, Scout, go.
 PROBST: Twila moves into the
lead with her third pair.
Eliza has her third pair,
getting down.
Chris has his third pair.
Eliza goes up high and has her
fourth pair; Scout with her
second pair.
Twila with four pairs now.
Chris has his fourth pair;
got to get back to that exit.
Eliza with her fourth pair,
Chris with four, Twila has
her fifth.
Chris has his fifth.
Eliza with five, Chris with
five, Twila with five.
We're tied up.
Twila up high has her sixth.
Chris has his sixth in his
mouth, trying to get back
to that exit.
Chris moves into the lead with
six pairs.
Twila trying to get back to the
exit now.
Twila with six pairs.
Eliza with sixth in hand.
 Ow. Watch out for me.
 PROBST: Chris and Eliza keep
bumping into each other.
Twila with seven, Chris with
seven.
Eliza has her seventh.
Everybody coming back with
pairs.
Twila with her eighth, Eliza
with her seventh, Chris with
eight.
Scout with three.
Chris with nine pairs.
He only has one left.
Eliza right behind with eight.
She's got two left.
 Where's the other?
 PROBST: Twila with nine and
Chris with nine.
They both only have one pair
left.
Chris has his tenth pair.
 Go, go.
 PROBST: Twila has her last
one.
Toss the blanks, there's one
letter in each pair.
Looking for two words.
A two-word answer.
Eliza not giving up, takes a
long jump.
Eliza back with her ninth pair.
She's got one left.
She's got to find it, then
got to get it.
Chris already working on it.
Eliza back with her last pair.
 I got it, I got it, I
got it, I got it, I got it.
I got it!
 PROBST: Chris wins immunity.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Final three.
 PROBST: All right, Chris, get
over here.
Big-time immunity, spot in the
final three.
 Yeah!
 PROBST: Sadly, after 37 long,
tough days out here, tonight at
Tribal Council, this game will
come to an end.
Somebody is going home.
I'll see you at Tribal.
 Back home.
 Back home.
 I'll tell you what.
 Hell of a deal.
 Of course I'm going to
say it's a beautiful day, but it
really is a beautiful day.
 It's a beautiful day.
That necklace looks good on you.
 Oh, man, I needed it bad.
I never give up.
That's the one thing.
I just knew.
I'm the last man standing, I'm
not giving up on this game.
I'm going to hang this up.
 Right on your tail.
 Twila gave me a run for
my money, but immunity is
what I wanted.
That's all I needed.
It's a good day.
 Go collect as many of these
little dead ones till we
get a pile of them.
 Okay.
 I definitely had my
work cut out for me.
 Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow!
 An alliance you've got with
somebody or trust-- it's not
meaning a whole lot right now--
it's making that final two and
getting a chance to win.
 Us three.
 Oh, you guys.
Listen, I want to tell you guys
that I have wanted this day
to come.
 It's gonna happen tonight.
 Whoo!
Right now, I just want to gloat.
I want to gloat that the little
wench is going home today,
tonight.
I'm gloating.
Chris, everybody, does this mean
I don't need to pack my bags
tonight?
(laughing): I know...
 No more.
I'm tired of ya asking.
Twila is so wound up.
You know, Twila works on me.
So, I'm gonna have to deal with
Twila all afternoon.
She gets on my nerves.
She's just totally out-of-
control nervous all the time.
If you want to josh Eliza a
little bit here and there,
go ahead.
 She was such a smart
ass and arrogant bitch last
night, it just pissed me off.
 Get her blood boiling
a little bit, because she come
down on you yesterday and was
trying to make you look bad.
 I know.
 So just wait about a
half an hour before and just
ride her like a dog.
 Thanks, darling.
I want to gloat, but that's just
what Chris wants me to do.
See, he...
The more I piss everybody off
right before they leave, the
more easier it is if we're the
final two that he gets all
the votes.
So, you know, I see what he's
doing.
He's working it.
 I've been wanting to
talk to you so bad because
you're the one that initially
come to me and said, "I want to
try to keep you in the game and
play the game with you."
 Right.
 And that's, that's what led
me to want to just finally sit
down and talk to you.
 I swear to God, I've wanted
that since the day I saw you.
Back there, I mean it.
I said I want to play the game
with that guy right there.
 It's going to be a
long afternoon for sure.
Just pretty much more I've
to put up with three women all
afternoon, and that sucks.
My alliance is with all three of
them, and, you know, they're
all bidding for their spot in
the final three.
I mean, we're both gonna vote
for Twila, and whatever happens
happens.
Twila thinks you're gonna
go home.
She has no idea.
They don't know.
I've never told them.
No one knows me and you made
a pact.
They have no idea.
 I'm lucky enough to be
in the final four with someone
that I feel that I can put all
of my trust into, and now that
we've made this pact, this final
two alliance, neither one of us
is going to vote against the
other person, and we're going to
do everything we can to get to
the final two together.
Have you tried to make a deal
with Chris?
 I definitely thought
about it.
Have you tried to make a deal?
 Huh?
 Have you tried to make
a deal?
 I've tried to make a deal
with everyone.
But I know that Twila is already
trying to wheel and deal, so I
think you should get in on that,
too, because I would rather see
you and Chris in the final two.
 You would?
 Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And, yes, call me sour grapes,
but... and I blatantly would
rather see people in the final
two that I like, that I would
be... I would feel comfortable
with either of the two people
winning.
I'd feel comfortable with that,
as opposed to somebody who I
feel like has lost their
integrity throughout this game.
So, you want to vote for Twila
with me tonight, huh, huh?
 I thought about it.
 I didn't come here to get
second place, and I sure as
hell didn't come here to get
third or fourth.
I come here to win, you know.
I don't look at myself as being
aligned with Scout and Twila
right now.
There's no loyalty, no trust.
There's nothing in the game
right now.
It's all about just getting
yourself to the next step.
To hell with everybody else.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury:
Sarge, Chad, Leanne, Ami and
Julie, voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
37 days; hard-fought, long days.
Tonight, this game will come to
an end for somebody.
That somebody will not be you,
Chris, wearing immunity.
I don't think I've ever seen you
as excited as you were today.
Eliza, do you remember back to
the first challenge, the one guy
who couldn't get across the
balance beam?
 Yeah, this guy right here.
I thought he was gone,
first day.
 You got to bring up
the beam, don't you, man?
You got to bring up the
balance beam.
 PROBST: Well, at this point,
it's something you've overcome
now.
You're still in this game.
 You're right.
Got off to a bad start, no
doubt.
 PROBST: Eliza, when you see
it around Chris's neck, are you
envious or do you think, "Hey,
you know, I like him?"
 Well, of course I'm envious,
but you know, if I couldn't
have it, Chris would be my
next choice for the person to
have individual immunity.
I mean, that's no secret.
So, yeah, I'm definitely happy
for Chris.
 PROBST: And you say it's no
secret.
You're referring to the fact
that you and Twila have been
pretty open about... you're just
different people.
 Yes.
 PROBST: And it does seem like
there's a friendship with Chris.
 Yes, yes, we've definitely
gotten really close and, you
know, I'm glad that we've gotten
to know each other and formed as
strong a bond as we have.
 PROBST: Twila, on the other
hand, there have been times
out here when you've said
in no uncertain terms, "I like
these people, but I don't trust
anybody."
 Exactly.
I have said that.
 PROBST: Still feel that way?
You're not that comfortable?
 Not that comfortable, but
maybe I'm wrong, but this is
the first night since I've been
here, I've been at ease.
I feel in my heart that I've
been at ease, the first night.
 PROBST: Scout, this is where
it gets really complicated,
because you can't risk telling
anybody the truth anyway,
because there's too much time to
maneuver out from under you if
you do tell them, so everybody
has to keep a secret.
Somebody here is gonna be
surprised, and yet, Scout, you
don't seem too worried.
 It would surprise me.
It could be me tonight, though,
and if it does, I'll go... and
get up and get my torch and
walk out.
 PROBST: Chris, you're a
little bit in the driver's seat
because you seem to have
relationships with all three
of these women.
 Absolutely I have a
relationship with all three of
these women, but, you know, I
can't take away my focus of
playing the game.
No matter if I've developed a
friendship with somebody.
Friendship... game.
Friendship right there.
I'm gonna have to put it back
here tonight.
It's time to play the game.
 PROBST: Twila, been days out
here where you went to bed and
thought, "Okay, I was maybe a
little rough today."
 Most definitely, yeah.
There's, there's a couple of
major mistakes that I've made
out here and I feel pretty
bad about.
The main thing that comes to
mind is swearing on my son's
name, and I'm very ashamed of
that, but I can't take it back.
 PROBST: What do you think his
take, James, will be on that?
 If I win a million dollars,
he'll say, "Hell, yes, Mom,
you can swear on my name any
time you want."
But I just shouldn't have done
it.
That's the bottom line.
I should have never have brought
his name into it.
I should have never done it.
 PROBST: All right, Chris.
You have immunity.
At this point in the game, I
think you'd be a fool to give it
up probably, but you never know
what somebody's strategy is.
 I am not a fool.
I'm not giving up immunity.
 PROBST: Okay, you cannot vote
for Chris.
Eliza, Scout, Twila-- one of you
is about to go home.
Let's find out who that's gonna
be.
It is time to vote.
Eliza, you're up.
 Twila, I am voting for you
for the third time this game.
You're like the cockroach that
won't die under the
refrigerator.
Hopefully, you're going home
tonight.
 You have drove me
crazy from day one.
If you go home tonight, it's
gonna be the happiest night
since I've been here.
You've got a lot of growing up
to do.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
The first vote-- Eliza.
Twila.
One vote Eliza, one vote Twila.
Liza.
Two votes Eliza, one vote Twila.
I'll read the last vote.
The 15th person voted out of
Survivor: Vanuatu-- Eliza.
You need to bring me your torch.
Eliza, the tribe has spoken.
Well, you've reached a critical
point in the game: final three.
Tomorrow you'll take part in the
last immunity challenge.
The winner guaranteed a spot in
the final two and gets to decide
who sits next to them at the
final Tribal Council.
Get a good night's sleep.
Grab your torches and head back
to camp.
Good night.
 I'm definitely disappointed
that Chris voted for me.
I was shocked that he wrote my
name down when he said he wasn't
going to and he, you know, gave
me his word, the whole pact.
It turns out I did not have a
single ally this entire game.
I look for the best in people,
and it's definitely going to
change my outlook and, yeah,
that hurts.
 Chris, did you see
that look Eliza gave you?
If looks was to kill...
 I mean, I don't know
what her problem is.
I just stick with my alliance.
That's all I do.
I ain't like her.
See you later.
 You know what?
There is a merciful God,
you guys.
Liza is not going to be running
her mouth.
This night is beautiful because
it's quiet.
There is no Eliza noises in
camp.
It was kind of like getting
a thorn out of your foot or
a thorn out of your side,
you know?
She just drove me nuts for so
long.
 Look up in the sky and
look how many stars there are.
 It's gorgeous.
 I never dreamed I'd be
playing the game the way I am,
lying, deceiving.
You ain't got no choice because
I tell you what.
If you don't step it up and
you don't start playing the game
in your best interest, to
benefit and go to the end,
you'll be sent packing.
And, uh, going back home with a
million bucks...
that'll change your life.
 Hey, Chris, here comes Jeff.
Jeff, I was gonna meet you, but
they don't want to stumble over
the rocks.
 PROBST: That's all right.
I'll come to you.
Well, it's day 38.
 Yeah.
 Whoo.
 PROBST: It's time for your
final rite of passage.
I know you remember the story I
told you recently about Roy
Mata, a very famous chief who
was poisoned to death by his
brother and then buried along
with all of his chiefs and
their wives.
Many of them were buried alive,
and they were buried on an
island that was then considered
so taboo after that burial, that
nobody visited for 700 years.
You may have figured it out.
If you haven't, you've been
sitting across it for 38 days.
 See, I figured that out.
 That's the island, no way.
 PROBST: Aratoca Island, also
known as Hat Island for the
shape of it.
That island is the most sacred
spot in Vanuatu, so it is a
fitting spot for your final rite
of passage.
You're gonna paddle over.
You'll find 15 torches of the
survivors who are no longer in
this game.
Take a moment at each one of
them to reflect on what impact
they had on the game, what
impact they've have had on you,
if any.
You will then go to the actual
burial site of Roy Mata, make an
offering.
This is a gesture of thanks to
Vanuatu for our time out here,
so bring something of value to
leave at this gravesite.
When you're finished, I'll meet
you on the other side for your
final immunity challenge.
Enjoy this time.
I'll see you over there.
 Thanks.
Being in the final three is
amazing to me, but I don't know
what's going to happen.
It's going to be a happy day and
a sad day all up in one.
 At this pace, we ought to
get there about noon tomorrow.
 We're making progress.
Brook, he was our first.
Really never really had much of
a chance.
 Yeah.
 It was a crazy three days.
You've got to out-will the
environment, you got to outplay
the other people.
You get caught in one bad day,
one bad situation, snip,
you're gone.
And that's what happened to me.
 Dolly was a very personable
young woman and had the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
 My experience out here
was short but excellent, um, a
little confusing because I found
myself caught in the middle, and
I wasn't able to make up my mind
quick enough, and it backfired.
 This whole experience is
really going to change the way I
look at things from here on out.
I'm going to appreciate those
around me more-- emotionally,
spiritually.
I'm going to appreciate fire.
 I'm usually pretty good
at getting along with almost
anybody, but, again, I'm
Italian, I couldn't control
the temper and I clashed
with a lot of people.
Ultimately it got me voted out
of the game.
 I don't know that I could've
done anything differently after
the first hour of the game.
Things were polarized so
quickly.
I probably shouldn't have
climbed that damn pole on
the first day.
Maybe that would have helped, I
don't know.
 Sweet, sweet Bubba.
 Yeah, Bubba was awesome.
Me and Bubba planned to stick
together to the end.
 You're not going to always
win, you're not always going to
have the best hand, but the
important thing is what did
you learn getting there?
I never realized that the prize
I'd be taking home to my
children is knowing who I am
now, that they know who their
father is.
 I made a comment that
was totally blown out of
proportion, and it cost me the
game, but, you know, at least I
went out with my word, and
that's what I said I'd do and I
did it.
 I'd love to say I'd walk
out of here with no regrets,
but I'm a little bummed, I'd
have to say.
I never thought I'd get
emotional in this game, but I'm
a little fired up because I
really, really wanted to win
this.
 I don't have a single
regret about being out here,
because I played this game.
I may not be a million dollars
richer, but no one has enjoyed
the experience of being on this
land more than I have.
Whoo!
 Sarge, good old Sarge.
He was definitely our...
our chief.
 My downfall was that I
put trust in age over looking
within each person individually
and judging them on, you know,
their actual character, because
I saw some young people out here
that had more character than
some of the older, wise people
that I looked up to back home.
 I was doing some soul-
searching, and I had to reach
down and find some stuff within
me that would allow me to be
strong on my own, and it ran the
gamut from suffering to joy--
just the whole gamut of
emotions.
It was just amazing, so, yeah, I
was able to find out, yeah, I'm
a pretty strong guy.
 There are days when I
thought: Why am I just not at
home on my couch watching TV,
eating chocolate cake?
But it was so worth every minute
of it for me.
 Then there was Ami.
 Coming into the game, my
strategy was to get the women to
stick together, and I have to
admit we created a very powerful
force.
We were definitely a force to be
reckoned with.
 Jules.
 Old Jules.
 The little sister I never
had.
 It's kind of a mental
battle to know what to
expose and what not to.
These people, some developed
into friendships, but they are
also your competitors, but you
have to keep persevering, and I
did at the end, and I feel good
coming out of it.
 What do we say about Eliza?
 What haven't we said
about Eliza?
 Looks to kill at Tribal
Council, that's for sure.
 This was definitely the best
experience of my life.
I mean, I don't think I could
have asked for anything more,
well, except, you know, to make
it to the final two, but day 37
is nothing to be ashamed of, and
I loved the game, loved the
competition, even the fights.
 This is where the chief...
 Oh, my goodness... Wow...
 ...was buried alive.
 Whew!
 The shells have definitely
aged.
Well, as they welcomed us to the
islands, that ceremony the
opening night, they blessed us
and gave us the opportunity to
have this as luck, and I'm going
to let them have their spirit
idol back.
 And we were also given
this chief staff and it looks to
me like maybe there's a chief
and a chieftess.
I'm not sure how it goes, but
I'll leave that scepter right
there in honor of a man who
actually gave his life on behalf
of peace.
 Thanks for letting us stay on
your island, keeping us safe.
I just want to offer this staff.
 The thing that I felt is
that I knew my feet were walking
the trail that indigenous people
have walked for hundreds and
hundreds of years.
I had a very special feeling of
being part of a history that I
didn't know about, but I had-- I
have respect for.
 To the chief.
Thank you for letting us stay on
your islands.
 Hey, hey.
 To the chief.
(Scout speaks foreign language)
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
All right.
You ready for your final
immunity challenge?
 Yes.
 PROBST: First things first,
Chris.
Give up immunity.
For the last time, immunity is
back up for grabs.
For today's immunity challenge,
you will use a bow and arrow.
You will strike the warrior
pose.
You will bring it back to the
ready position and a white paper
marker will fall down in front
of your arrow.
You want to hold this position
for as long as you can endure,
because when the pain gets too
much, you will release the
tension and you will pierce the
marker and you're out of the
challenge.
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: In addition, if
at any time either of your
feet hit the platform, you're
out of the challenge.
 Okay.
 PROBST: For the winner,
guaranteed spot in the final two
and a very big decision at
tonight's Tribal Council: Who
will you choose to sit next to
you at the final Tribal?
Had a long paddle in, you had a
long walk through uneven
terrain, let's see how much
willpower you have left.
You will be doing this barefoot.
Take off your shoes.
We'll get started.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, pull them back,
drop the marker.
We are on.
Do not lose your concentration.
Don't let your mind drift.
There's very little play.
You let go for a moment,
it's over.
As if right on cue, the sun is
coming out, making a tough
challenge even tougher.
Fight through it, it's going to
be tough in the beginning.
Get through that first stage.
38 days you've been out here.
Now is not the time to fall
asleep.
Scout has pierced her marker.
She's out of the challenge.
Take a seat on your platform.
You're down to two: Chris
and Twila.
Twila uneasy on the stumps.
 Oh...
 PROBST: Twila with a
good save.
Just about fell off.
 You know the outcome, Twila.
 PROBST: And the deal-making
begins.
 It's as good as gold, Twila.
 PROBST: Twila not responding.
 Talk to me, Twila.
 Come on, Chris, give it up.
You had it last time.
 Hey, Twila, I proved
to you two times in a row, man.
You're the one that turned your
back on me at Lopevi.
 I might fall off this thing
and ram this thing through my
ass, but I sure as hell ain't
going to step down off this
pole.
 Hold your focus, Twila.
 Scout's telling you to
keep your focus, Twila.
 It's all part of the game.
 Speaks volumes, especially
with Scout cheering you on,
so I think I know where you're
coming from.
You'd better stay up there.
 PROBST: Challenge is on.
 Challenge is on.
 PROBST: How long do you think
you guys have been up there?
 I have no idea, but I'm sure
you're going to tell me, right?
 PROBST: 55 minutes.
 Sweet.
Scout, you dreaming
about Twila winning?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Feeling it in your
forearms?
 Sure.
 PROBST: How about you, Chris?
 No, it's too early.
I'm not feeling nothing yet.
 PROBST: Buy that, Twila?
 No, not at all.
 PROBST: So, Chris, if there's
so much trust, why aren't you
stepping off?
 Exactly.
 Because I want to win.
 "Because I want to win."
 Damn, that heat feels good,
doesn't it?
 Love it.
It's like being by the paver
back home.
 Gosh, dang it.
 PROBST: Twila, pierced your
paper marker.
Chris wins the final immunity.
 God, yeah!
 PROBST: Chris... well-earned.
 Yeah.
Couldn't come at a better time.
No, it couldn't.
 PROBST: Final immunity is
yours.
 Final immunity is mine.
 PROBST: So, tonight, Tribal
Council-- one of these two is
going to the final Tribal
Council with you.
You have the afternoon to figure
out who that is going to be.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Good effort.
Long day.
Head back to camp, guys.
 I pulled it off.
I got immunity.
I'm still pretty shocked.
Twila was some stiff competition
in that challenge, but there was
no way I was losing, no way I
was losing.
Long day.
 Really long day.
There's water.
I'll set it out for you guys.
You can have all you want.
 Chris and I, we had an
agreement for the final two.
If he won, he would take me; if
I won, I'd take him.
I don't know if he will now,
because I feel like maybe he
thinks I tried to hang into that
challenge just so I could take
Scout with me, but it's not
true.
I wasn't trying to win it for
Scout; I was trying to win it
for me-- for me, my own self.
 At that challenge, Scout
cheered on Twila and said
"Hang in there."
Scout was praying to the gods
Twila won that immunity.
Scout wanted to go to the
final two.
I guarantee you, they had a
pact, and if I find out they
did, Twila ain't necessarily
going to the final two.
I need you to be honest with me,
Scout, because I'm going to tell
you right now...
 Okay.
 I don't know who I'm picking.
 Don't play me, Chris,
'cause I-I really just...
 I'm not playing you, but you
need to be honest with me.
 Okay.
 Because I feel like
I've been played.
Did you and Twila have an
agreement to go to the final two
together?
 No.
We had an agreement to go to the
final four.
We had an agreement that we
would take Liza out.
 I'm startled.
Twila told me the truth, and I
didn't believe her.
I figured that you two had an
agreement.
 No.
 I couldn't believe how
honest Scout was.
Scout definitely is smart enough
to realize why I was asking her,
"Did you and Twila have a pact
to the final two?"
She could have very easily
said, "Yeah," and Twila would
have been packing tonight for
sure, but she's honest, and I
respect her for that.
Ah, that did it.
The bottom line is, there's
people on the jury that's going
to base their vote on likability
and there's players going to
base their vote on who played
the best game and it's something
I can't predict.
 Hey, Chris, one big hug.
 I don't know if I'm gonna
take Twila or Scout to the
final two, I don't know.
My decision could be made at
Tribal Council tonight.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury-- Sarge,
Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie and
Eliza, voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
Long day.
 Very.
 Very long day.
 PROBST: And then you had your
final immunity challenge with
obviously a lot at stake, so
let's go through that.
Chris, the minute Scout goes
down, you start talking, "Let's
make a deal."
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Only the deal you
wanted to make was for Twila to
step down.
 It was the perfect deal for
me, you know.
If she steps down, then you
know, we both get to rest, but
Twila is very thick-skinned and
doesn't give up and she fights
to the end, and when Scout said,
"Hang in there," I didn't think
we were so good after Scout said
that, so I wasn't about to step
down, and I don't blame her for
not stepping down.
 PROBST: So, this afternoon,
you're a popular guy.
You've got immunity, not a
better spot to be tonight than
the one you're sitting in.
Did you get approached?
 Um, actually, no, I
did not get approached.
We went back to camp and they
both understood that I was... I
was holding the deck of cards
and, you know, I was the only
one that was going to play and,
you know, I've still got a
decision to make, so...
 I just feel extremely
good about both of these people.
There can't be a bad outcome in
this game.
They are just amazing people.
 PROBST: Twila, could there be
a bad outcome for you tonight?
 Most definitely.
I played the game hard.
I've wanted to win from day one.
I've done everything I can to
get where I'm at now, and I
don't want to settle for third.
 PROBST: Chris, when you hear
the two different sides-- Scout
on one hand saying "I'm happy,
it's fine."
Twila saying "I am not done"--
that obviously has to factor in
a little bit to you, because
you're making a $900,000
decision tonight.
 Well, I listen to that
and I respect the way Scout got
to this point in the game.
You know, Scout mentally played
the game strong, and Scout was
willing to change the game, not
only for her benefit, but for
other people's benefit, and I
look at that and then I look at
Twila, and I see how aggressive
Twila was in playing the game.
She did what she had to do to
get to the final three-- whether
it be lie, tell the truth, be
loyal, break an alliance, it
didn't matter-- and she admits
that.
But I'm not going to look at how
they played the game.
I'm looking at how I played the
game and I've got to finish.
 PROBST: Then let's get
to the vote.
You cannot vote for Chris.
That means, Twila, you can only
vote for Scout; Scout, you
can only vote for Twila.
Your votes cancel each other
out.
You won't vote.
Chris, you'll cast the only vote
and you will do two things
simultaneously.
You will vote out the 16th
person from this game, and you
will decide who's gonna sit next
to you at the final Tribal
Council.
You will in effect choose your
opponent.
It is your vote.
Go make it.
I'll go get the vote.
Once the vote is read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the vote.
The 16th person voted out of
Survivor: Vanuatu...
Scout.
You need to bring me your torch.
Scout, the tribe has spoken.
You've gone as far as you can go
in this game on your own.
The power now shifts to these
six jury members and Scout, who
becomes tonight our seventh jury
member, now hold your fate in
their hands.
We will reconvene for one final
Tribal Council tomorrow night.
In the meantime, you have one
night left.
Enjoy it.
You've earned it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 I feel really good
about how I played the game.
I maintained the loyalty and
integrity as long as loyalty was
there to embrace and when it
wasn't, I embraced another
alliance and was able to turn
the game around, make it a whole
lot more exciting and fun, and I
feel really good to have gotten
this far and wish Chris and
Twila the very best.
 This is the last pot
of manioc I'll ever make.
This is probably the last time
I'll ever eat manioc.
 With any hope.
This is day 39. This is it.
I made it.
I turned things around in my
favor and it paid off.
 I am definitely feeling
stress on a day that I
never imagined I would feel
stress.
I was ready to get up today and
enjoy the entire day, and I
found myself thinking, "I've got
to keep playing the game."
I've been thinking about Tribal
tonight.
 Yeah.
 I ain't gonna take no crap
from any of them, are you?
 I'm going to try not to.
 I mean, they're not going to
run me in the ground because
I lasted longer than them.
And I mean, I just know
how you are.
Twila is extremely outspoken,
and I can use that to my
advantage tonight.
I mean, I want them to remember
exactly how Twila was: just a
cutthroat, didn't-take-no-crap
kind of player.
I just think about some of the
people on the jury taking their
disappointment out on us.
 They will.
 I really don't know if
I'm inclined to sit there and
let them do that.
I mean, I'll just sit and think,
"Well, I know Twila ain't gonna
take no crap, so I'm not gonna
take no crap."
 I'm not.
 Great, Twila, you let them
know you don't give a crap
and that you come here to win.
Chris isn't gonna do that.
Chris is gonna sit back and let
Twila put the last nail in her
coffin.
 I'm a little apprehensive
about tonight.
I honestly feel like I deserve
a million because I did play the
the game the best.
I didn't suck up to anybody.
I didn't pretend to be something
that I wasn't.
Don't hold it against me because
I outwitted and outplayed you.
I deserve their votes just as
much as Chris.
 I think I'm ready.
 Back to reality reality.
 That's right.
It's over with after tonight,
okay?
 Yeah.
 No way is this party
coming to an end.
 Whoo.
(Chris grunts, Twila laughs)
 What an ending.
 (laughing): I haven't
laughed that hard since
I been here, I don't think.
 The closer Tribal Council
gets, the... absolutely
the more concerned I'm getting.
You know, in the back
of my head, I just keep thinking
"that women's alliance,"
you know?
All of them might just say,
"Hey, look, the only way we
can prove this women's alliance
worked is for a woman to win
this game."
And just out of spite, they can
vote for Twila.
 Isn't it funny how I'm
actually going to probably miss
this place?
 It's been wild, ain't it?
‚ô™ ‚ô™
(bird twittering)
 The sense of pride that I
come out and played this
game, when I get out of here, is
gonna be with me for a lifetime.
Everything that I will be able
to take home with me: the
memories, being by the ocean and
seeing things and doing things
I've never seen and done before,
it's been... it's been an
amazing adventure.
 It's kind of ironic,
you know, at the Alinta camp
when there was six women and
just me.
I wasn't in charge, I wasn't the
chief.
I wasn't making the calls, and
that's the opposite of what this
place is all about, you know--
that's their heritage, that's
what they believe in.
And now it's down to me and a
woman.
If, unfortunately, I get second
place, being the last man in the
game, that's an accomplishment
in itself.
I never dreamed I'd be... I'd
be where I'm at, no way.
And it's still hard,
you know, it doesn't quit.
I guess it will quit when I walk
off this island and it's
completely over.
 PROBST: We now bring in the
members of the jury: Sarge,
Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie, Eliza
and Scout, voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
Chris, Twila, welcome to your
final Tribal Council.
One bit of business to do.
Immunity necklace.
Immunity not back up for grabs.
First, let me say
congratulations.
You two have done what 16 other
people were unable to do in this
game: make it to the final two.
But now, after 39 hard-fought
days, the game takes a twist.
Your jury, made up of seven
people that you had a hand in
voting out, now control your
fate in their hands, and based
on tonight's final Tribal
Council, they will decide which
of the two of you they think
is most deserving of the title
of sole survivor, and more
importantly, the million-dollar
check that goes along with that.
Tribal Council is where you are
held accountable for your
actions.
Expect to be held accountable
tonight.
That's why we're here.
Here's how it's going to work.
You two will get a chance to
make an opening statement.
This is your first opportunity
to plead your case to the jury
why do you deserve the title of
sole survivor and the million
dollars.
The jury will then get their
first chance to address you
since being voted out.
Once the jury has asked you
their questions, you will get
one last opportunity to make a
closing statement, and then we
will vote.
Clear?
 Yep.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Chris, opening
statement to the jury.
 I think I, you know, I
think I deserve to win as sole
survivor for, you know,
many reasons.
I think besides not only being
loyal to the alliances that I
made throughout the game, I
think I'm the person that
overcome more odds than anybody.
I was the last man standing with
six women.
I just think I deserve to win
this game because of the odds I
overcome.
That's all.
 PROBST: Twila.
 I came to this game with
one goal, and that goal was to
win a million dollars to better
my life and my son's.
I played the game to win, I
played it hard.
I know I didn't do everything
that I should have done and
should have done more in some
other incidents, but it came
from my soul.
Everything I did was to win this
million dollars, and that's why
I believe I should be the sole
survivor tonight.
I believe I've earned it.
I worked hard for it.
That's all.
 PROBST: All right.
Jury, in a moment, you're going
to get your first opportunity to
address Chris and Twila since
you were voted out of the game.
Give you a minute to think about
what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right.
Jury, it is now your chance to
address Chris and Twila for the
first time since you've been
voted out of the game.
Eliza, you're up.
 Um, before I address
my question to you, I have a
couple of comments.
Twila, I'll start with you.
Congratulations.
You achieved what you set
out to do.
You came into this game, saying
you would do whatever it took to
get to the final two, and that
you did.
You were a deceptive, lying
bitch throughout this game.
You never treated me with an
ounce of respect.
You didn't even speak to me like
I deserved your breath.
I might envy your position in
the final two, but I do not envy
your life.
Now, with that being said, I do
think you played a good game,
and you were outright about it.
Chris, you, on the other hand,
you shocked me.
You shocked me.
Whereas I knew Twila was going
to be a deceptive, lying bitch,
I did not know that you were a
deceptive lying bitch, too.
You pretended to be my friend.
I mean, you stabbed me in the
back with the Julie thing and
then you stabbed me in the back
again and rubbed salt in the
wound-- unnecessary, blatant
lies!
My request tonight from the two
of you is, I would like an
apology.
Twila, you first.
 Eliza, I never talked to
you with any disrespect when
you respected me.
I never said any bad words to
you until the latter part of
this week, not at all.
 You're right.
You just said mean and
hateful and spiteful things
behind my back.
 All I said was, you talk
too damn much, and you do.
 That's a lie.
 What else was I supposed
to have said, Eliza?
 What? Oh, my God.
Should I start listing things?
 I'd like to know.
 You said that I didn't
deserve to be here, I was a
spoiled brat, um, that I...
 But did I not tell you
that to your face?
And I did tell you how I felt.
 Is this, is this an apology?
I mean, if you don't feel that I
deserve an apology, then fine,
fine.
 I'm just getting to the
point.
You feel that I'm a lying,
deceptive bitch, well, I think
you're a spoiled, rotten
little child.
And if you don't owe me an
apology for how you feel about
me, why should I apologize to
you for the way you feel about
me?
 Okay.
 And I just don't feel like I
owe you an apology, no, I don't.
 Okay. Chris?
 Eliza, when I made that pact
with you standing there, I
didn't intend to do you wrong.
I did it as strategy, and you're
right, I owe you an apology.
I broke our pact and I am sorry.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Eliza.
Julie.
(Julie sniffles and sighs)
 I thought I'd at least get
one sentence out before I
started to cry, but I'm
feeling abnormally emotional
tonight, so...
(sighs heavily)
Um, Twila, I saw all your
tactics, antics and, I mean, I
tried to get you out of the
game, like what, five, six
times...
My energy is directed towards
Chris tonight...
 Okay.
 ...in the fact that I'm
either voting for Chris or
against Chris.
So, I just want to let you know.
 That's fine.
 (sniffling): Christopher,
um, you approached me as a
friend and asked for help
with everything to lose.
I helped you as a friend with
nothing to gain for myself, and
you were the one person who I
gave the opportunity to hurt
my feelings.
Surprise.
I'm here crying.
Um, so I have two questions
for you.
First off, there are several
occasions where I described our
relationship, brother-sister,
and I don't understand why you
had to doll it up that much,
to look me so solidly in the
eyes and base things on our
friendship and on things that I
felt were real.
So, that's my first question.
 Julie, you are absolutely the
hardest decision I made.
 Okay, great, like fabulous,
but why the story?
It was so elaborate.
 Because at the time I
had no intentions of writing
your name down; at the time,
my intentions were for me and
you to stick together.
You looked out for me, you know,
and I felt like it was my turn
to look out for you.
 It was.
 I lied to you, Julie, and,
I mean, I can't take it back.
 Okay.
Second question: When did you
start playing me?
And I want the truth, because
this is it.
I'm not set on who I'm
voting for.
I'm pissed off at you, so tell
me, what was authentic about our
relationship and you?
 I didn't play you, Julie.
I lied to you and I let my heart
get in the way, and at the end,
I didn't even know if I was
going to write your name down
and decided at the booth, I
just... I played the game.
I did you wrong, Julie, and I'm
sorry I lied to you.
If you disregard anything to do
with me, I understand, but I
truly looked at you as a little
sister and...
 That's enough.
That's okay.
 I'm sorry.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Julie.
(Julie sniffling)
 PROBST: Leann, you're next.
 Twila.
 Yes.
 One of the turning points in
the game particularly for me was
when you decided to turn your
back on a four-person alliance
and vote me out, and on the day
you decided to do that, you
reinforced your loyalty to
me, this time using the words,
"I swear to you on my son's life
that you have my word."
Could you explain to me your
thought process in betraying my
trust in our alliance, and why I
should reward you for it with
a million dollars?
 I felt that it was supposed
to be Leann, Ami, Scout and
myself.
I felt when you all turned your
back on Scout and brought Julie
into the alliance, I felt that
you could easily have turned
your back on me at any time.
 Even though I never
did anything to... to make
you doubt my trust?
 I didn't trust you all
anymore after you brought Julie
in, I did not.
I am sorry for that,
because I did trust you.
Ami, I never fully trust full
wholeheartedly, but I did
trust you.
But when you brought Julie into
it, I felt like, you know,
it's gonna be you three and I'm
the one that's going to be
sitting on the outside, and I
couldn't do it.
So I had to change the strategy
and that's why I did what I did
in the end, not out of
disrespect for you.
 Fair enough.
Chris.
It's no secret that from day
one, I was pretty much hard-core
with the women's alliance, and
my intention was to see that
through to the end, no matter
what.
Convince me to abandon that way
of thinking and vote for you
tonight.
 When we merged, I knew
without a doubt, you know, my
work was cut out for me.
If I wanted to stay in this game
any longer, then I had to look
for an opening and a backdoor
opened by who else?
Twila come to me and offered me
a chance to further myself in
the game, and I took advantage,
you know, when the opportunity
came.
I just feel like I persevered,
and I think that is the reason
why, you know, I think I'm
deserving to win the game.
 Thanks.
 PROBST: Ami.
 Right now, I just see
some serious irony in that.
Twila, even though you had a
chance to totally and completely
make an apology that maybe you
didn't believe in, for a million
dollars you wouldn't do it, but
you'd lie for a million dollars,
you'd break friendships for a
million dollars.
You say, um, just didn't really
trust Ami.
I don't know where that came
from, because you had 100% of my
loyalty.
And, Chris, I'm still just
baffled at why you took the
time to flat-out lie to two
people for no reason.
I don't understand it.
Chris, I want to know from you
first what attributes you think
you have that put you in the
seat there, and that you think I
don't have putting me standing
right here?
 I really don't see me having
any qualities any better than
you when it comes to this game,
I mean, absolutely not.
I think that you're on the jury
because you have a soft heart.
I think you're on the jury
because I didn't give you
a break.
You give me a break.
You've let your guard down, you
put personal feelings in front
of the game, and, you know, it
was your demise.
 Thank you.
Twila, same question.
 First of all, I want
to start out, if you don't mind,
by apologizing to you and Leann
for swearing on my son's name.
I should have never brought him
into it, I should never have
done that.
I thought of the game and I
thought, now, either they're
going to respect me for the
decision that I've made to
further myself in the game and
that's why I'm here, but now I'm
this low-life bitch that nobody
likes and I don't understand
that.
 Twila, you flat-out lied
to us.
You flat-out straight to our
face said, "I'm your friend...
 I did.
 "...I'm going to be here
till the end."
That's what you did to
both of us.
 That's not the way I see it.
I feel like...
 I want to hear the
answer to your question.
Why are you sitting there and
why am I standing there?
 Maybe a little bit more
harder, a little bit more
colder, maybe.
You don't have it in you.
And I have it.
I wear it on my sleeve.
It's not... I haven't tried to
hide it from any of you all and
maybe that's why I'm here, and
you're there.
 PROBST: Thanks, Ami.
 Mm-hmm.
 PROBST: Chad, you're up.
 Twila, I'll start with you.
I want you to think about your
experiences out here the past 39
days, and I want you to think
about something that's
changed you.
 If you're talking about in a
bad sense, I need to watch what
I say and how I come across to
people, because I've always felt
like I've had to defend myself
all the time, so maybe I need to
ease up, back off.
I'm a little hard and quick to
judge sometimes, and that's not
a good thing.
 Okay. Chris, same question.
 Without a doubt, the one
thing that's changing me as
a person is experience in
playing the game with the final
nine people and seeing the
genuine qualities people possess
when there's a million dollars
at stake and how those genuine
qualities never falter.
In the latter stages of the
game, I found that the money
started talking.
I started looking at getting to
the end no matter what, and I
feel like the two people that
possessed the least amount of
those qualities are sitting
right up here, and I look at the
seven people on the jury--
everybody sitting over there
possesses a genuine quality that
they look past the million
dollars, and that's something I
didn't do, that's something I'll
take with me to try to become a
better person.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Chad.
 Thanks.
 PROBST: Sarge.
 Uh, basically, touch√© to
both of y'all.
You outwitted, you outplayed,
you outlasted me.
I'll start with Twila.
First and foremost, I hold
myself true to my beliefs and my
values-- loyalty, duty, respect
and honor-- and I only surround
myself with that type of people.
I wouldn't want to see you
on a street.
I wouldn't want a phone call.
I would never want to see you
again, okay, but congratulations
because you outplayed me.
Now, getting on to my question.
After I sat here and listened,
you need the million dollars,
and I'm 99% sure right now,
you're probably going to get my
vote, okay, but I've got to
know-- a million dollars, is
that the price tag to cast your
son's name straight to hell?
Is the price tag for casting
his name to hell worth a
million dollars?
'Cause you say that you hope
that your son forgives you.
If my mother did, I'd tell her
to kiss my ass, okay?
So, just tell me yes or no, is
the price tag $1 million?
 No.
 Okay, Chris.
Right now, she needs my help
because she needs to buy back
that doggone respect, so right
now, you're probably not going
to get my vote.
What I need to know is, where
does my friendship stand with
you, and does it still stand
strong as it was before you
found out that I wasn't going to
give you a million dollars and
will we be sitting at a race
someday?
 There's not a price on
our friendship.
We developed a friendship from
the time we met.
We connected.
I don't care if you vote for me
or not.
We'll be friends after this
game.
Give your vote to Twila,
I don't... We'll be friends
after this game.
We'll sit in Charlotte and watch
the race.
That's a fact.
You've got my word on it.
 Cool.
 PROBST: Scout.
 Twila, you and I formed an
alliance the very first night.
Chris, I've been with you 38
days into this game, and I've
been with you as each of these
members came off, so I know your
true response to each of these
fallen comrades, and Twila, to
your credit, you're not able to
bull... very much, but I value
the integrity of your ability to
still speak your truth even
though it trips you up and gets
you in trouble sometimes.
You can't not be Twila.
And Chris, you are bull up to
your ears!
(chuckles)
I'm not sure where that takes
you except that it sits you
right where you are.
Thanks for the 38-day ride.
It was great.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Scout.
Thanks, jury.
Well, Chris and Twila, you guys
have been through the wringer.
Based on everything you've heard
tonight, you know where they're
coming from.
I'll give you a second to think
about your last words to the
jury.
 PROBST: Okay.
Twila, Chris, you've heard from
the jury.
The jury has definitely spoken
tonight in very clear terms.
You know what is on their mind.
This is your last chance to
change a mind.
Twila, you're first.
 I didn't come into this game
intentionally wanting to deceive
or to lie to anyone.
I don't do that back home and
anybody that knows me knows my
word is good.
Whether you believe that or not,
it is good.
All I thought about since I've
been here is bettering my life.
That's all I've thought about
and how I can do it.
I didn't worry about your
feelings, I didn't worry about
your feelings, none of you.
That was selfish and self-
centered of me.
People kill for less than what
we're playing for right now.
Maybe that sounds hard or cold,
and it actually turned me into
somebody I don't like.
Sarge, you don't have to
rub it in.
You don't have to make me feel
any lower than what I already
feel for doing what I did.
You don't understand how that's
bothered me.
I highly respect you and to hear
you say that just kills me.
(voice breaking): I apologize
to each and every one of you.
It wasn't the game I intended
to play.
It was the game that ended up
playing me, and, uh... if I
could do right again, I would,
and for that I apologize.
If you can forgive me, then
maybe I can forgive myself.
That's all.
 PROBST: Chris.
 Scout, you called me out.
I'm a bull...
But you made me realize one
thing.
I can't bull... a bull...
Good point.
Julie, alls that matters to me
is, it ain't your vote, that's
for damn sure.
I would just like to mend some
fences, and I did you wrong, and
you still are like my little
sister.
And I brought you your hat.
Eliza, you are absolutely right,
I definitely owed you an
apology.
What happened with you and Julie
makes me feel like I don't
deserve to be sitting here,
that any one of you would
probably deserve it more, and
that's no bull...
I truly feel that way, and I
just want to tell you again
I'm sorry.
'Cause you give me your word and
there's no doubt in my mind,
you'd be sitting right here if
it wasn't for me.
I was your demise.
Ami and Leann, I came across an
opportunity in the game and I
got to sneak in the backdoor
because of the very person
sitting to my left and because
of Scout.
They changed the alliance.
They changed the course of the
game, and I took advantage
of it.
You're both sitting there
because I did what I had to do
to benefit myself.
Chad and Sarge, no matter how
you vote tonight, I still made
two dear friends, so just vote
from your heart, you know, just
feel good about who you vote
for, that's all.
 PROBST: Okay.
It is time, finally, to get to
the vote.
It's a little different tonight.
Tonight you are not voting
somebody out of the game.
You are voting for a winner.
Chris, Twila, you want to see
your name on that parchment
tonight.
It is time to vote.
Sarge, you're up.
 Psych.
I had to know where our
friendship stood.
You know where I stand: honor,
integrity.
Good job.
 Twila, thank you for
the experience of a strong,
unspoken women's alliance.
We took it to the end of the
game.
I love you.
 Chris, you definitely
screwed me over and you
definitely hurt my feelings, but
ultimately, I like you better.
I just wish I was the one
sitting there next to you.
I hope you win.
 (whispering): Twila, the
fact that it comes down to
the very end and in your
answers, you didn't give any
crap answers.
You really said it from your
heart.
You only said the things that
you meant.
 PROBST: Okay.
For the last time, I'll go get
the votes.
Well, I know it's been a long 39
days and a long, respectful, but
certainly emotional final Tribal
Council.
I would love to read these
tonight, but it's not gonna
happen.
Going to have to wait till we
get back to the U.S.
I'll see you there.
 PROBST: This is where I get
off.
(applause and cheering)
(cheering)
 PROBST: All right, let's
do it.
(cheering and applause)
(applause continues)
 PROBST: I know you guys are
ready to get to this.
Nothing left to be said.
Certainly put through the
wringer at the final Tribal, but
fair to say you both had it
coming, right?
 Right.
 PROBST: All right.
Let's get to the vote.
Tonight you want to see your
name on that parchment.
Tonight the jury voted for a
winner.
There are seven votes.
You need four to win.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Chris.
(applause and cheering)
Chris.
Two votes Chris.
(applause)
Twila.
(applause and cheering)
Two votes Chris, one vote Twila.
Twila.
We're tied.
Two votes Chris, two votes
Twila.
Chris.
Three votes Chris, two votes
Twila.
The winner of Survivor: Vanuatu,
Chris.
(applause and cheering)
 Yeah!
(whooping and laughing)
 Hi, Chris!
Oh, my God...
 Hey...
(applause and cheering)
 (all chanting): Chris!
Chris! Chris!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 PROBST: Well, he's certainly
one of the most unlikely
Survivor winners ever.
Chris came back from a lousy
performance at the first
challenge, infiltrated the
women's alliance, and ultimately
beat the women at their own
game.
It was an emotional final tribal
