         CHRIS: You question a woman's
character, you question a
woman's ability, she'll snap
your neck.
You open up your heart, show a
woman you're vulnerable, then
they start thinking with their
heart.
That's when they open up that
backdoor.
That's what's happened this
time.
(sustained applause
and cheering)
(tribal-style drumming)
 JEFF: That is just one of the
reasons Chris is sitting here
tonight as winner of
Survivor: Vanuatu-- your
ability to read people.
We have everybody here.








It is the reunion show.
We are live in Hollywood.
And, Chris, looking back on
this, rough start for you on
that balance beam...
 Without a doubt.
 JEFF: ...then the women's
alliance.
You get down to this last guy.
Was there a key moment anywhere
in that game that changed things
for you and changed your track?
 CHRIS: Yeah, absolutely.
After the merge and the women
began voting off...
started out with Rory and their
pecking order went straight
down to me, I think the turning
point for me was after Chad got
voted off, and I was put in a
situation back at camp where,








you know, I had to watch what I
said.
And basically, there was a time
during the game when Julie had
asked me a question before a
challenge, and her question was,
since she jumped back over the
fence with the women, was: "Do
you hate me?"
And I said, "No, no, I don't
hate you, you know, I'm really
disappointed."
And that was the way I left it.
 JEFF: You played the
disappointment card.
 CHRIS: Yeah, I pulled out a
sympathy card, and Julie-- Julie
was absolutely, you know, the
person that campaigned for me,
with Ami, and little did I know
how strong Leann's word in their
alliance was until we just
watched it, but...
 JEFF: One of the points in
that is you did a good job of
figuring out what people wanted
to hear or what they needed to
hear.
Had you said to Julie, "Yeah,
I'm mad," she'd have probably
said, "Well, tough."
And then you played this big
brother:
"I'm just really disappointed."
 CHRIS: Yeah, well, Julie
had caught a wrath from Chad.
Chad was extremely upset with
Julie when they voted off Rory,
and, you know, Sarge... Sarge
had a little bit of trouble
containing himself.
 JEFF: You saw an opening to
go a different way?
 CHRIS: I saw an opening to
keep my mouth shut, because
there's six women, and we
had no control of the game.
 JEFF: Julie, he pays you back
by putting his arm around you,
stroking your hair and then
cutting your throat.
 JULIE: Yeah, and I actually,
and I wined and dined him before
he gave... before he did cut my
throat.
 JEFF: And then who'd you vote
for?
 JULIE: I voted for Chris--
because he played me so hard.
I wasn't going to vote out of
spite.
 JEFF: So you were able to
separate personal feelings at
that moment and still look and
say, "He did play me."
 JULIE: Yes.
 JEFF: And you said somewhere
in there, you gave somebody an
opportunity, you picked somebody
to trust...
 JULIE: Right.
 JEFF: Which you ultimately
have to do.
 JULIE: Right. Yeah.
 JEFF: It was the person
who... who... who got you.
 JULIE: Exactly.
 JEFF: Eliza, basically the
same story.
 ELIZA: Yup.
 JEFF: He comes to you and
says, "I've never broken
my alliance."
He does the same thing-- little
pat on the back, rub of the
shoulders, pull out the knife,
boom, you're gone.
 ELIZA: Yup.
 JEFF: Who did you vote for?
 ELIZA: I voted for Chris.
 JEFF: Now, was your vote for
Chris or against Twila?
 ELIZA: A little bit of both,
but it was a lot against Twila,
I have to say.
I mean, I was pretty... pretty
upset with her.
I felt like she had treated me
with no respect throughout the
game and she had been really
awful to me.
You know, throughout watching
this, I have grown to love Twila
and, you know, I don't harbor
animosity, but at the time I was
furious with her.
 JEFF: And, Chris, did that
factor into your decision of who
to take?
Were you looking and saying,
"Here's who I think I'll do
better against in the final?"
 CHRIS: Oh, absolutely, every
day that went by.
(laughter)
You know, God bless Twila.
She's Twila and, you know, you
define Twila and just watch the
game and you'll define Twi...
Just, um, absolutely.
Twila is outspoken, and Twila
wasn't shy about telling
somebody what she thought,
especially with Eliza, and with
six women, you know, absolutely.
She was...
 TWILA: What you're saying
is I most of the time said the
truth, but you lied like a dog
and won?
 Yup.
 TWILA: Is that what you're
saying?
I see how it works.
 CHRIS: That sounds good to
me.
(applause and cheering)
 JEFF: I think that's pretty
clear at this point.
 TWILA: Thank you very much.
 CHRIS: It's what she said.
 JEFF: Leann, you also voted
for Chris.
 LEANN: Yes.
Well, it was twofold.
Um, Chris, I mean, there was no
way a guy was getting to the
final four, much less the final
two.
He had to have played.
Kudos to him, and secondly, I
promised Twila I'd never
write her name down.
(laughter and applause)
 CHAD: Good one.
 JEFF: So, again a bit of a
vote against Twila.
Your vote sounds like it was as
much against Twila as it was for
Chris.
 LEANN: As much as want to
separate the feelings and game,
I found it very difficult and,
yeah, my feelings were hurt.
 JEFF: On the flip side, Ami,
in spite of everything you said,
you voted for Twila.
 AMI: I couldn't help it.
She played me and I didn't think
I could be played to be honest.
She got me.
She got me, and she got me right
in the face, and to me she
deserved it.
She got me straight on.
 JEFF: Did anything of your
vote for her have to do with the
women's alliance and just
voting for a woman?
 AMI: No, it definitely
didn't, because Chris played an
awesome game, but it came down
to Twila got me.
Chris had a little bit to do
with it, but of course he would.
She flat-out outplayed me, so I
didn't have anything against
Chris at all.
I thought he played a great
game.
 JEFF: I didn't read the last
vote.
The last vote was for Chris.
You got two votes, one was Ami
and one was Scout.
Same question.
Was it the women's alliance that
kept you in there voting for
Twila?
 SCOUT: Yes. I had a real
alliance with Twila, I kept it
all the way to the end, and when
the final vote came down, I
couldn't give a million dollars
for that much ...
(laughter)
 TWILA: I love you, Scout.
 JEFF: Sarge, you voted for
Chris.
The question is, was it, "I'm
voting for a man all the way, or
was it based on Chris, or was it
against Twila?
'Cause that's what I sensed.
 LEA: No.
It was never a man-woman thing.
I do not look at anybody,
man-woman.
Everybody's equal.
What I looked at it is, I would
never surround myself with a
person that has no values.
I live my life on a straight
line-- values, honor,
discipline, and if someone does
not live on that wavelength,
then I will not surround myself
or not reward that.
 JEFF: And you're talking
specifically about Twila lying?
 LEA: Yeah.
 JEFF: So here's my question.
Here's my...
 LEA: Okay, let me back up.
It's not about the end.
The end had nothing to do with
it.
It had nothing to do with her
son James, great boy.
It had nothing to do with that.
It had to do at the point in the
game when she turned on me,
okay, and that's where my vote
came from.
 JEFF: So nothing to do with
the lie?
 LEA: No.
 JEFF: Because that's what you
said at final Tribal Council.
You made this big speech, and my
question to you was, "For a guy
who lives with this moral code,
you based your whole comment on
hearsay," something that
happened after you were out of
the game.
 LEA: Partly it did, okay.
At Tribal Council, that was
anger speaking.
That was, you know, that was
anger speaking.
Now, after I... after I thought
about it, okay, it came from
that, but it came from who... I
guess who lied more, because
they both lied their teeths off.
 JEFF: Okay, fair enough.
 LEA: But it was never men and
women, never.
 JEFF: All right, Chad, your
vote for Chris, why?
 CHAD: I looked at the big
picture.
I had nothing against Twila
personally, but I looked at how
well this guy played the game,
and from every season I've seen,
I've seen every... and I think
this guy has played the best of
anyone.
He's good at challenges and the
whole picture.
 JEFF: Ami, women's alliance,
we start out, we have men versus
women, and a group of women get
together and they say, "Let's do
something that's never been
done; let's all stick together,"
and you do a good job;
we get 7-3 at the merge.
By the time you get to the jury,
you have five women and you have
a woman on the final two and
still a guy wins, a guy who lied
to every woman here.
Why is it so hard...
(applause and cheers)
Why is it so hard to keep a
woman's alliance together?
 AMI: I really just think it's
hard for women to really support
each other and believe in each
other.
It's been a long time of women
not really standing for each
other, being their best, and we
we, we lost it.
We really did.
We started wondering what was
going on behind closed doors and
who was talking about who, and
that's where we lost it.
We didn't focus on let's just
get four women to the final
four.
 JEFF: Leann, why do you think
women have such a hard time?
 LEANN: Um, well, you know, it
wasn't that we wanted to take
all the women and have them at
the end and, and get rid of all
the guys first, but the goal
was, at least my goal was, to go
to the final four with all
women.
And it was working for a while,
and it got screwed up when they
voted me off.
 JEFF: Julie, is there a
difference in how Chris played
this game in that Chris, it
seemed like, made people feel as
though he did have personal
relationships with them...
 JULIE: Right.
 JEFF: ...when he actually
didn't, but everybody else did.
 JULIE: And I'm just figuring
this out.
I mean, I thought... I don't
even know if you have feelings
sometimes.
 CHRIS: I have feelings.
I have feelings, and, um...
I have feelings.
I have feelings.
 JEFF: We'll let you off on
that.
All right.
Well, not since Jonny Fairplay
has somebody lied on a family
member's name--
we all remember that--
this season it was Twila.
She paid for it, maybe a million
dollars.
Has anybody forgiven her?
We will find out.
The Survivor: Vanuatu Reunion
Show continues right after
this.
 TWILA: I came to this game
with one goal, and that goal was
to win a million dollars to
better my life and my son's.
On my son I swear, and you all
know how much I love that boy.
I swore to Ami and Leann on my
son's name that I was with them
100%.
But maybe if I could win a
million dollars, God will
forgive me, I don't know.
I hope.
 JEFF: Twila, Twila... so your
comment was "But maybe if I win,
you know, God will forgive me."
You didn't win.
Regrets now on that?
You talked about it at final
Tribal.
 TWILA: I had regrets from the
get-go. I never...
 We forgive you.
 TWILA: Thank you.
 AMI: I'll forgive you.
 TWILA: I never... When I said
that, I'd seen the game coming
down as Ami and Leann would have
been one and two, Julie and I
would have been third or fourth.
 JEFF: You don't have to
justify the reasons.
It was a strategic move, you
played that card.
 TWILA: Well, at the time it
wasn't a strategic...
It was the honest truth at the
time, because I didn't see the
game changing.
So, when the game... when there
was an opening, when they
decided to take Eliza out before
Chris, then that gave an
opening.
By that... that time, it was
too late.
I couldn't take it back.
 LEANN: We all decided to take
Eliza.
 TWILA: Yes, when we decided
to take Eliza, it was too late,
I couldn't take it back, so I
was screwed.
 JEFF: Ami, why such a big
reaction to that lie in a game
in which lying is part of it,
and Chris lied so much, so many
more times and to everybody?
(audience murmuring)
 AMI: Well, I-I-I just have to
say that I didn't expect
anything from Chris.
We didn't really have an
alliance.
We didn't have anything.
I expected a lot from Twila, and
swearing on a family member is
big to me.
I've lost a family member.
I know how much it's worth, so
that was a tough one for me to
handle.
 TWILA: Did you not hear Chris
swear on his family's name?
 AMI: He didn't swear on 'em
to me, but it...
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
She's playing the game.
For her, it was the perfect
thing to do, the perfect thing
to do.
For me, different.
 JEFF: Scout, what's your take
on the lie, the reaction to the
lie?
 SCOUT: Well, the reaction to
the lie.
The game brings out lying in
you, but the thing that really
puked me out was all the self-
righteousness that came out
about people.
(audience applauding)
Whoa!
And here's my deal.
If people are so self-righteous,
everybody are so self-righteous
and they're so loving and so
harmonious, then why don't they
just forgive her?
God did, I do... forgiven.
(applause)
 AMI: I obviously did forgive
her.
I've forgiven Twila.
I realize that was her game.
I have totally forgiven Twila.
It still doesn't mean that it
meant any less to me.
I totally forgave Twila.
 JEFF: Let's go to... James is
here in the audience-- Twila's
son-- so we'll go to the final
word on this.
James, stand up.
So, you, you had to live with
this, your mom uses your name.
What's your take on it?
 JAMES: She was playing a
game.
I mean, I love her to death
still whether she won or lost.
I mean, that's... I love her,
and she was doing the best she
could, like she... she's always
done her whole life trying to
help me out as much as I can--
as she can, and better herself,
so that's, that's it.
I mean, she's playing a game.
I don't, I don't... I'm not mad
about it.
 JEFF: Thanks, James.
(applause and cheers)
I have to say that-- and this is
a bit of an editorial comment,
but that happens all the time on
this show-- Twila probably came
into this show, out of anybody
who's been on it, with more
need in terms of truly needing
it, knowing that she works seven
days every single week.
 SCOUT: Three jobs.
 JEFF: Doesn't make a lot of
money.
 Lisa needs the money!
 TWILA: Keiffer needs the
money.
Where she at?
 JEFF: But what I'm wondering
about is, you don't see that
when you're in the game,
and when you, when you look back
on the show and you watch it
play out, did anybody have a
change of opinion?
Julie, do you have a change of
opinion now on Twila?
 JULIE: Completely. Oh, God.
I wanted to get Twila out, I
mean, three or four times.
I watch it, she's so endearing
she's real, she was honest.
I was completely disillusioned
by Chris, completely.
Twila came straight every time.
And I can't believe I didn't see
it.
I love Twila.
I think she's a great player.
 JEFF: Eliza...
(applause and cheering)
Eliza, you guys had
differences based on a lot of
things probably outside of that
lie, but has there-- just from
you, I'm just curious about
watching Twila because she was
so unique in that as someone
said, "Twila can't not be
Twila."
 SCOUT: Right.
 JEFF: Did you look at that
and say, "Okay, I'm starting to
understand this woman a little
more"?
 ELIZA: Um, a little bit.
I mean, I thought that I had,
you know, moved past it and, and
gotten over it, and then the
last couple of episodes, you
know, watching her be so
childish about the bananas and
then watching her, you know,
just, just berate me in camp,
telling me I didn't deserve to
be there, that I just, you know,
that I was a terrible person,
whatever else she said about me,
you know, it made it hard, it
made it hard.
It didn't endear me to Twila,
no, not especially.
 JEFF: Ami, you were saying,
and I kind of interrupted you,
that you did have a change of
heart.
Is that based on seeing what you
don't see on the show?
Because a lot of interviews are
done on this show are in
private; that's the whole point.
You don't know what people are
saying about you, and then when
you watch it, you get an idea of
who their true self is.
 AMI: I think I had a pretty
good idea of their true... of
her true self especially.
Um, I just let emotions get in
the way in certain points, but I
still think Twila is the same
person I started the game with.
 JEFF: How about you, Leann?
Any change of heart?
You were, you were upset with
her at the end, obviously.
 LEANN: Definitely.
Um, I guess, you know, I don't
feel like Twila is a bad person.
I just felt a little hurt.
I mean, I felt a little hurt,
and that wasn't necessarily why
I voted for Chris.
I voted for Chris because he
played really well.
I, um, you know, I had a hard
time getting over it, just
because when you spend time with
somebody and you're consoling
them when they're crying or
you're making a sign
for her son for his birthday,
you get caught up.
You think it's a real
friendship.
So, yeah, when they betray you
and lie to you, you feel a
little hurt.
I mean, I couldn't help it.
But now, you know, I'm-I'm ready
to get over it.
I'm willing, absolutely.
 JEFF: Sarge, obviously, Twila
was very upset and hurt because
she respected you so much and
she asked for your forgiveness,
and so far it doesn't seem like
there's any chance that's
happening.
 LEA: No.
I did have a change of heart at
the end of the game, okay, and
I've already told Twila I
forgive her, that what's gone on
between her and James, they will
deal with on their own.
I forgive her because I'm not--
I mean, who am I to judge
anybody, you know?
 SCOUT: Amen.
Yeah! Whoo!
 LEA: I wasn't talking to you
anyway, Scout.
But I'm talking to Twila.
You're just as bad.
But, uh, I mean, she, uh...
she is a good person, and from
day one, from day one, when she
came into Lopevi, we bonded, we
talked; I knew how many hours
she worked.
So, uh, I mean, I respect her
and I forgive her
wholeheartedly, and she's a true
friend of mine now.
 TWILA: Yes.
 JEFF: Good. I like to see
that.
Well, if you think the emotional
toll on a survivor is tough,
wait till you hear the story of
a survivor loved one.
We're going to meet Chris's
fiancée and find out from her
why every Thursday night was
followed by a Friday morning
therapy session.
We'll be right back.
(applause and cheers)
♪ ♪
 JEFF: During this season of
Survivor, the loved ones were
required to participate in an
immunity challenge, and at this
point in the game, Chris thought
he was going to be voted out if
he and his fiancée lost and they
did.
This is what happened.
Survivors, ready.
Go!
 CHRIS: Come on, Lorie, walk
faster!
Stop!
Lorie, no, no!
Lorie, there, there!
 LORIE: Come on, baby!
 AMI: I think this goes down
here.
 JEFF: Ami wins immunity.
(applause)
 JEFF: All right.
This is Chris's fiancée Lorie.
Here's the deal.
The survivors aren't supposed to
talk to anybody at all about
anything, including loved ones.
So, you leave Vanuatu.
You think, "We've lost the
challenge."
Chris told you in no uncertain
terms, "I'm going home."
 LORIE: Exactly.
 JEFF: You go home and think
just that, right?
 LORIE: Yes. Correct.
 JEFF: And when he comes home,
what does he tell you?
 CHRIS: That he got voted off
that night.
 JEFF: Oh, he did?
 LORIE: Yes.
 JEFF: So he let you believe
that happened.
 LORIE: Yes. Yes.
 JEFF: So he's...
 LORIE: Yes.
He did.
 JEFF: So, first of all, Chris
just got outed for telling you
something, but it was a lie, so
he's going say it's okay,
'cause...
 LORIE: Exactly.
 JEFF: ...'cause that's his
character; we already know
that about him.
 LORIE: Right. Yes.
(laughter)
 JEFF: And... and you were
very upset, though.
I remember when you left the
challenge, this was not "aw
shucks," you were devastated.
 LORIE: Very much.
I knew he was the last guy
standing.
I just knew, with all those
women, that women stick
together.
 JEFF: And so, every Thursday
night, you're watching this, and
when it gets time for this
challenge, what I thought was
interesting in talking with
Chris is, you're trying to say,
you know, seven's pretty good.
Seventh out's not bad.
But he doesn't tell you
anything.
You didn't know he was final two
until tonight.
 LORIE: Oh, absolutely not.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I literally thought on
Thanksgiving night that we were
taking the red-eye to New York.
 JEFF: So you could do your
interviews for the press.
 LORIE: Exactly, for The Early
Show Friday morning.
 JEFF: Chris can lie to
anyone.
He's so good.
 JEFF: Julie, obviously, the
emotional toll on someone like
Lorie's tough because they don't
even know what they are getting
into and then they find out
they're in an immunity
challenge.
What about for you guys?
Physically and emotionally, is
there any way to actually
prepare for this show?
 JULIE: You watch Survivor.
You know the outline
of Survivor-- outwit, outlast,
outplay-- but yet for me,
there's no parallel world.
I went in and human nature took
over.
I started caring for these
people and you have faith that
you want to believe in them.
I did.
I mean, I don't know if I'm the
only one, but I mean, it was
hard and... that you can't
explain the emotional component
of this from sitting and
watching it on TV.
 JEFF: After you were out
there 36 days...
 JULIE: Yes.
 JEFF: ...learn anything about
yourself that you really took
home?
 JULIE: Completely, um, and
about other people.
You can't really tell where
people draw their line of trust
or beliefs, you know.
You only know where yours are
and that's what I gained from
this experience.
 JEFF: Is knowing where yours
is?
 JULIE: Knowing where mine is.
 JEFF: Ami, how about you?
Take anything away from this
game that's still with you?
 AMI: Well, first I have to
say Lorie's tears saved his butt
because all of us ladies were
like, "Oh... poor Lorie, she's
going think it's all her fault.
It's so sad..."
 JEFF: Well, you know why she
thought it was her fault.
Because Chris says...
 JULIE: "It's your fault."
 AMI: Yes!
 JEFF: He says... No.
Well, Chris says, "I'm sorry I
lost," subtext meaning, "I'm
sorry you lost."
Yeah, you were pretty brutal
about it.
 AMI: But at the same time,
she won that for him because he
stayed in longer and it was one
of the reasons was our heart.
Like, "Oh, gosh, she feels so
bad."
 JEFF: I see what you're
saying. In the game.
 AMI: Yeah. We felt so bad
that she felt so horrible-- at
least I did-- that she felt so
bad that she thought she lost it
for him.
 JEFF: What about yourself?
 AMI: The biggest thing I
learned about myself was the
quicker you forgive, the better
you feel, because I had so much
anger and hate towards Twila for
a while, and the second I just
let that go, just completely let
it go and realized it's a game,
this and that-- (sighs)-- the
whole world was lifted off my
shoulders, the second I learned
how to forgive.
(applause)
 JEFF: Rory, how about for
you?
Very colorful in this game.
You had some highs and you had
some lows.
 RORY: I had a lot of highs
and lows.
 JEFF: Anything you took away
from this that you're different
now as a result of this
experience?
 RORY: Well, um, I really need
to be true to myself, and no
matter how hard you try to put
on a facade or try to play the
game, your true colors are gonna
come out in this game.
I realize that I need to maybe
hold my tongue just as Twila
does.
We need to learn that same
lesson a little bit more.
But when that's part of your
personality and you're
independent, that's what's going
to come shining through.
It's been a... I just want to
thank God for bringing all of us
home safely, especially in light
of everything that we've got
going on.
(applause)
 JEFF: Leann.
You were in this thing, then
you had the rug pulled out from
under you and you've made a
couple of comments tonight that
lead me to believe you've
thought a lot about what
happened out there and your part
in it.
 LEANN: Um, oh and in so many
different dimensions.
I mean, strategy, the game, what
could I have done different,
that thing, but yet the whole
experience itself was... it
happened in a time of my life
that was transitional, and I
came out feeling empowered, like
I can do anything.
It was really-- I mean, I'll
never forget it.
It was fantastic.
 JEFF: Sarge, you were one of
a kind, my friend.
And, uh, what... what-what's
your experience?
I don't know if you would take
anything from this game, but if
you look back on it, what did
you take out of it?
 LEA: I took out of the game a
new outlook on civilians, okay,
because...
(laughter)
I mean, 18-and-a-half... 18-and-
a-half years I've been living a
life where you do what you're
told when you're told, you know,
and there's no question, and
someone... I learned that
someone can say no.
And, you know, I learned that,
you know, that there's people
out there that have no clue
about their future.
They live day to day.
I mean, they... their occupation
is reality game star.
 JEFF: Rory is pointing at
John K.
 LEA: Yeah, I mean, John K.,
he came into the game flat broke
and he... he didn't pull no
punches.
He said, "I'm flat broke."
He said, "I'm a, you know, I'm
an aspiring model and I got
to..."
So, I mean, I learned that
there's people out there that
are different, and I have to be
more diversified about my view
of people, and I-I, you know, I
like to, you know...
In two years, I'll be a
civilian, so I've got to learn a
lot.
 JEFF: All right.
(applause)
Well, up next, this guy is so
good, the rest of his tribe-
mates didn't know he had a
prosthetic leg until he told
them.
That's next, but first, here's a
little pig wrestling.
(pigs squealing)
(pigs squealing)
 JEFF: Lisa's got a big pig!
 CHAD: You guys agree that I
had a pretty good run down
here.
I didn't fall or anything.
(applause and cheering)
 JEFF: Chad, coming into this
game, when we met you in
casting, we talked about the
leg, and we said, you know, we
want you on the show, but you're
obviously going to have a big
problem.
You're going to have to convince
people that this is not a
liability.
You set out to do that, and it
seemed like it almost worked too
well.
 CHAD: Yeah.
I wanted to prove, not prove
myself and demonstrate what I
was capable of,
but at one point, it just became
a non-issue, and then I kind of
wanted to backtrack and say,
"Hey, look, this is kind of
impressive, you know."
(laughter)
"Look what I can do!"
 JEFF: It's pretty true.
You're probably as physically
agile as 90% of anybody that
we've had on the show, man or
woman.
(applause and cheering)
Was there a reason connected to
your leg that you wanted to be
on...?
You had a rare form of cancer,
that's how you lost the leg.
It was briefly talked about in
the show.
 CHAD: Synovial sarcoma.
Synovial sarcoma.
 JEFF: Was there a connection,
or did you want to do the show
separately of that?
 CHAD: I've wanted to do this
Survivor for years.
My wife wouldn't hear of it at
one point.
We had the kids, right, okay?
But, yeah, but I knew that once
after I had surgery, I knew,
first of all, it would be
something to get me noticed.
Secondly, I said this is going
to be a great platform to show
what, you know, people with
disabilities are capable of.
So, I was just happy to be able
to do it. It's great.
(applause)
 JEFF: Speaking of, uh, of
disabilities, Scout,
I've never seen any-- no one's
ever made it to the final three
hobbling along like you did, and
it turns out, you go back home,
it turns out you have a, uh, the
wrong-sized kneecap in?
 SCOUT: No, I have the wrong-
sized knee.
My artificial knee did not fit
me, so I had to have a brand-new
one put in two months ago.
And, you know, I played this
game 20 to 40 years older than
everybody, dragging my leg
around, and, uh, it was an
interesting thing, 'cause what I
learned to do was prop myself
up.
I used to work with handicapped
people, and just to keep myself
coming and be in good spirits.
 JEFF: What was the reaction
when you went home?
You've been with your partner
for 20 some years, but you
weren't officially out as a gay
couple.
You're in rural Oklahoma.
Were they accepting of you,
because now it's out, it's on
Survivor, everybody's watching.
 SCOUT: You know, uh, people
have been fabulous.
I mean, case in point, we were
at the gym the other day and
this big muscle builder came up
and he just came up with tears
in his eyes and said, "You're
just so beautiful.
It was wonderful to see your
reunion," and, uh, so what?
People just have been fabulous.
Thank you so much.
(applause and cheering)
 JEFF: Brook... I'd give you
the moniker as the most
frustrated first voted out ever
because you were such a huge fan
of Survivor.
 BROOK: Yeah, I know.
Um, for me, you know, I...
(cheering )
I came into this game, I wanted
the full 39 days, and the Fat
Five over here stole 36 of those
days from me, but I'll tell you
something, no one will ever take
the three days I got.
Unbelievable, a dream come true,
and I'll be at home, waiting for
the phone to ring.
My man Burn, put me back in
the game, Burn!
Please!
Please, Burn, put me back in
the game.
 JEFF: Dolly...
 TRAVIS: Jeff, Jeff, the
Fat Five...
We're the Fat Five, let me tell
you something.
We've lost weight and we happen
to be the ladies' favorite.
We're sweet, delicious and
fat-free, baby.
 JEFF: Well, Bubba, you-you
did, you have kept the weight
off; you're very thin.
 TRAVIS: I've kept the weight
off and stuff 'cause I been...
and I've got more energy to play
with my boys and stuff, so it's
a win-win situation.
I don't think you could say
anybody up here's a loser,
because what we took home with
us is appreciation of family
and friends, and that's what
it's about.
(applause and cheering)
 JEFF: Dolly, what's going on
with the sheep?
 DOLLY: Oh, I've got 38 little
baby lambs at home that will go
to the market on Monday, so I
go home to an empty nest.
(laughter)
 JEFF: How 'bout you, John P.?
I want to get some updates,
see what everybody's doing.
What's going on with you?
 JOHN P.: Oh, life's been
great.
Just got back from Atlanta,
Georgia, did a "Surviving
Holiday" national ad campaign
with Home Depot and, uh, doing
some traveling, doing some
traveling working with kids in
elementary and high schools on
some motivational and leadership
speaking, so it's been great,
it's been great.
 JEFF: Mia, how 'bout you,
what's up?
 MIA: Life is, um, great.
It's back to normal, I'm back in
Boston, um, bartending.
We got to see the Red Sox win,
finally, so it was nice coming
home to that.
(cheering)
And, uh, life's been great.
Just back to normal, very happy.
 JEFF: Brady, congratulations.
You came home and got married.
 BRADY: I did.
Actually, I, uh, I came home and
then went to Australia to get
married.
 JEFF: Oh, good, nice.
 BRADY: My little Australian
bride, yeah.
 JEFF: Lisa, what's going
on with you?
Six kids, family happy to have
you back?
 LISA: Oh, yeah, they love it.
Um, I'm just home, you know,
being a mom to six kids, and,
um, thanking God every day for
Survivor.
I had the best time of my life
and doing some...
 JEFF: You didn't want to
to come home, did you?
 LISA: No, I didn't.
(laughter)
No, I'll do it again tomorrow.
Take me.
 JEFF: John K. you were
doing some modeling before, you
doing it now?
 JOHN K.: Yeah, same as
always.
I'm just going to be, go back to
school next fall, so it will be
great. That's what...
(woman calls out from audience)
 JOHN K.: That's what I'm
anticipating, you know?
I can't wait. It's been a while.
 JEFF: And, Rory, one
question-- your wife sent a
letter from home about six hours
before you were going to burn
down the camp and talked you out
of one of the best Survivor
moments to never happen.
 RORY: My one regret in the
whole game is that I didn't burn
down that damn camp.
(laughter)
 JEFF: All right.
Well, tomorrow morning on the
CBS Early Show, Chris is going
to get a check for a million
dollars.
(cheering)
He's also going to get the keys
to a new car, the first ever
Pontiac G-6.
Nice ride waiting for him
outside.
We're going to take a break, and
then we're going to show you
where Survivor is heading next.
We'll be right back.
 JEFF: Well, as Survivor:
Vanuatu finishes up, soon a new
season of Survivor will begin.
Here's a sneak peek of where we
are going next.
It started in Borneo, and over
the past nine seasons, Survivor
has visited some of the most
exotic lands on earth--
places like Australia, Kenya,
Thailand, the Amazon and
Vanuatu.
But now a group of new castaways
will travel to the most stunning
location yet: the islands and
waters of Palau, a place that
some have called the eighth
natural wonder of the world.
A tropical setting of stunning
islands, dense jungles and an
underwater world beyond belief.
It was in this part of the
world that war raged in the
1940s.
Today the remains and wreckage
of war haunt these waters and
jungles like ghosts of a
violent past--
an eerie mix of man's explosive
history and nature's power to
reclaim.
It is here that 20 new castaways
will be abandoned.
From the beginning, the game
will be changed in a dramatic
way.
Everything the survivors have
come to expect will be wiped
out in the first ten minutes.
Who will outwit, outplay and
outlast all the others to
become the sole survivor?
The adventure begins with the
premiere of Survivor: Palau.
 JEFF: That is going to be
fun.
If you want to own a piece of
Survivor: Vanuatu, you can.
All kinds of props, memorabilia
are going to be up for bid
We've got the urn with all the
votes, the immunity necklace,
the castaways' torches, which
they would love to have,
all authentic stuff, and it
benefits our good friends at
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids
Foundation.
To date, we've raised over
a million dollars.
Plus, it you want to be on
Survivor, number one, don't
call if you're going to quit,
but if you think you have what
All the information is there.
Finally, thanks for watching.
We have a very loyal audience
every single week, and we do
this show for you guys.
Next season of Survivor will be
right here on CBS, and Ali, your
hair will grow back.
Get well.
Good night, everybody.
(applause and cheering)
