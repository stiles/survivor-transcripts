        Previously on...
Eff: j.t. and boston rob go at itard.
Coach takes a hard hit.
Byay 12 it was all out war
between the roes and the villains.
Stop,stop!
James was the latest casualty.
But the biggest battle was
back at the villains camp.
Parvati was fighting for her life.
Move your arms like this.
Parvati is the most
dangerous player on our tribe.
Meanwhile,russell and rob
battled it out for petroleumsy.








It's personal with me and rob.
He thinks he's tough,may
the best man win.
Russell believed he was
in an alliance with parvati
and rob believed he was
aligned with everyone else.
Rob jumps down on the final piece!
Villains win immunity.
But when rob led the villains
to yet another victory
his battle was post-postponed.
Villains,congratulations.
While the heroes were
marching into another vote,
james' injury made him a liability
and candice considered voting with the
outsiders tom and coal by to take him out.
You can't lug around dead weight
and james is a lot of dead weight.
But at tribal council,she played it safe








and voted with the
majority to take out tom.
The tribe has spoken.
Making colby the odd man out
in a tribe going nowhere fast.
15 are left.Who will
be voted out tonight?
You want a hug?
- ***
- Really.
Really.
At tribal tonight tom went
home and i voted for him
because there's no reason
to throw a vote away
and make the people that are going
to be coming home tonight mad at me.
You going to bed?
Yeah,i'm going crash.
Nobody trusts candice.
She was gunning for james.
I'm so sick of candice right now.
So candice has to go.
♪♪♪
I wanted to talk to you.
Just sitting around
and thinking too much.
I don't want to be at your throat.I
don't want you to be at my throat.
I decided to have a conversation
with rob to make him think
that i'm not after him,which i am.
I don't care how strong he is.
I don't care who he is.
He's threatening russell,when
you do that,you go.
A lot of people are mad,though,that
you went looking for that idol
because we all said
nobody's going look for it
and if you were then
you're going to be marked.
I went looking for it.But if i
get the next clue,i'll find it
because i'll go looking for it again.
I'm just being straight with you,man.
♪♪♪
Russell's going to find out soon
enough that he's out of his league.
I just did everything i could to
make him more paranoid as i could,
to see he runs around like a crazy man.
I'm not a rat and i'm
not gonna say who it was,
but a lot of people are mad that
you went looking for that idol.
They want your ass off.
He's not playing with
the amateurs anymore.
He's playing with the big boys now.
I'm just telling
you,watch your back,man.
Well,same thing to you,man.
Watch your back.

Tree mail!
"when things look
desperate,never lose hope.
Never throw in the
towel,you just have to cope.
And never,ever give up,even when
you're at the end of your rope.
" doesn't say whether it's
for reward or immunity.
Tree mail was a bit vague this morning.
We don't know whether it's
reward,immunity,or both.
The biggest question to me is
what does it mean for james?
I would put a whole
lot of money on the fact
that there will be
challenges in our future
that james simply will not be
able to do because of his injury.
Come on in,guys.
♪♪
Tom voted out at the
last tribal council.
Danielle,surprised at this vote?
Yes,definitely.
We for sure thought james would be gone
but he must have a strong
alliance on the other side.
All right,you guys ready
to get to today's challenge?
Yes.
First thing's first,sandra.
I'll take it back.
Once again,immunity
is back up for grabs.
Today it's a little different.
Today you'll be competing as
individuals against your own tribe
seeking to win individual immunity
which will keep you safe
at tonight's tribal council
because tonight both tribes
are going to tribal council.
Both tribes are voting somebody out.
This is your chance to
make sure it is not you.
So both tribes will run this challenge
separately,here's how it works.
Each person will be
attached to a long rope
that is threaded through
a series of obstacles.
You'll climb over,crawl
under,maneuver around those obstacles
as you make your way to the finish.
First person to the finish
wins individual immunity,
is safe at tribal council.
After both tribes have
run this challenge,
the two winners-- one from each tribe--
will then square off in a showdown.
The winner of that challenge
wins for their tribe
hot dogs,fixings,soft drinks
which you will enjoy tonight
as you listen in on the
other tribe's tribal council.
So you not only win food,you get insight
into the dynamics of the other tribe.
A lot at stake.
One thing of note.
Coach,j.t.,and tyson all competed
in this challenge in their season.
J.t. and tyson went on to the
final,tyson ultimately won this challenge.
All right.We'll rock paper
scissor to see who goes first.
We'll get started.
Villains won the rock paper scissors.
They want the heroes to go first.
Fighting for individual immunity.
Survivors ready?
Go!
You've got to follow the
rope through the course.
Your body these go
wherever that rope goes.
You're going to have to throw
yourself through this course
if you want a shot at winning.
James even with a bad knee
is fighting to stay in this.
What a trooper.
Definitely affecting his
mobility but not his spirit.
Amanda now in the lead.
Candice right there in it.
There are going to be a lot of
scrapes,bumps,bruises when this is over.
James now in the lead in this challenge.
Who would have ever predicted this?

M tell you,three us vote for

The three of them are going to

I'm telling you,if we
vote three and three
and there's a tie then there's a revote.
That meansither one of
those two two are going home.
If he plays the idol she's going home.
If he gives they are
idol he's going home.
Do you understand?We can'tose.
You can'lose that way.
This other way,it's too risky.
I'm just thinking to myself,you know,
tyson's one of my allies and if
it were me that didn't win immunity
they'd be coming after me and
i know they're coming after him
and i was just think ofay so that
russell doesn't get the bert of us
if he does have the idol.
Parvati first
option,russell second opon.
Basically i threw out an
insurance policy,you will.
There's no way they can back door us
with the idol and we'll all be safe.
As long as split our votes
one of them two goes home.
That's it.
I think the vote'soing to be
pretty straightforward tonight.
Rob,myself,sand,we're
voting for russell.
Courtney,coach,and jerri
are voti for parvati.
Don't sweat it.
I'm telling you.
It's not rocket science,but i
don't have immunity d any time
i don't have immunity i
feel a little uneasygl.
♪♪
I'm going to do it.It's
breaking my heart.
And i just wanted to tell you i'll do
what i have to do to stay in the game.
There's nothing i can do to hel her.
So i'm going toe for parvati
and then that will be it.
She'll go home.
If there's any way victim
tried to save her,i would have.
But i've been thinking i've got
to play this game for myself.
When russell came and told me
he wanted to vote out parvati
i thought it was an excellent
opportunit maybe swap my vote to parvati.
I mean,i want her out.
Don't like doing it but i've got to.
I hope there's not a revote but
i just want to get it over with
and get some hot dog in my mouth.
The smartest thing for them
to dis make it a three-way tie.
That would force the idol.
Then they can play however they
want to play on the second vote.
That would be a genius move.
I don't know if they'reobt smart.
I don't know if it would be the
right thing giving parvati the idol.
It's just...
This is a really tough decision here.
Way worse than last time.
It is really bad.
Jerri,going all the
way back to season two,
what is onsignificant
way "suor" has chged?
It's like you get out
here and it's game on.
Like,trying to create alliances that
sort of thing right from the get-go
and it seems like the typical rvival
things now are not as important.
Rob,what's another element
that's different now
that we didn't have back in season four?
Hidden immunity idols.
That puts a whole
other twist in the game.
I mean,you can use it
to protect yourself,
to protect somebody else.
You don't know whether
somebody has it or not.
We all know who has it.
Russell,if you don't have
it and you didn't find it,
you'll best look for it.
Point blank.
So,russell,there's at
least one person in here
who's certaiyou have it and if you
don't,that makes it tough for you.
Not really.I mean,if you
ain't got it,you can't play it
so it don't make it too tough for me.
Tyson,you think it's
better if you doave the idol
or it's something you really
want nothing tdo with it.
Well,i guess it can help
you in some instances
but when the numbers
are this bg still it's...
It's not going to be that beneficial.
Arvati,as a tribe,you
guys have done very well.
But still,there has to be things about
each person on this tribe that
you're a little suspect of,shad about.
What's the take on tyson?
Tyson's a threat because
he's really charming
and he's funny and he also has
connections with coach,with j.t.
on the other side,he's tight
with rob,he's tight with sandra.
Son's a huge threat.
Sandra,what's the big n aboutarvati?
Well,we keep going back to the fact
that sheas connections onhe other side.
Courtney,what's the ke on rob?
There s to be a polarizing affect.
People either like him or
they're really bugged by him.
Yoknow,just at the center of
controversy a lot of times.
All right,well,there's at least a
couple of people clearly on theot seat
and what appears to be a
fair amount of uncertainty
about which way this
vote is going to go.
Let's get to rob has the
immunity necklace around his neck.
Yes.
Cannot vote for rob.
Everybody else is fairame.
It's time to vote.
Danielle,you're up.
Welcome to the big leags.
You're so dam charming and
that's what makes you dangers.
That and friends on the other side.
Night-night.
You need to get the
ocean and wash your ass.
I can't stand you andan't
wait for you to go home.
I'll goaledly votes.
If anybody does have the hidden
immunity idol and you want to play it,
w would be the time to do so.
if anybody does have the hidden
immunity idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.
I think i'm going to take
the target off of my back.
No,not this way.
You know,coach,you always say
loyal,honesty,and trust is the best thing.
No matter how this comes out
toght,i'm going to stick to that.
Parvati...
Are you serious?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
I guess i'm playing it.
Such a gentleman.
Jf: the rules of "survivor" state that
if a hidden immunity idol is played
then any votes cast against
tha person will nocount
and the person with the next highest
number of votes will be vote out.
This is,indeed,a hien immunity ido any
votes cast for parva will not count.
This is a bold move by russell.
I'll read the votes.
First vote,russell.

enjoying hot dogs and soft drinks.
I'll give you a moment to move
your torch,we'll get started.
Oh,an,i hav nobodyto blame but myself.
I was a victim of my own stidity.
Russell probably gained a little bit
of respect and a little bit of power
by his risky move today ving the
idol to parvatias kind of a shocker.
It ended upbeing my demise.
I wish i would have
stuck to the split vote,
i would have come out victorious
and russell would have gone home.
At you gonna do?
I'm still pretty awesome.
Heroes gettin your first
look at the new villain tribe.
Tyson voted out of
tonight's tribal council.
All right,heroes,as you know,part
of the reward of today's challenge,
the villains earned the right to s
in and listen in o your tribal council
and enjoy hot dogs and soft drinks.
You guys can remove the
covers and get started.
Damn.
Don't drop the buns.
So evil.
Wasn't our idea.
Rupert,you haven't taken
your eyes off that food,
even while i'm asking yo the question.
No,i already had a
couple of them dogs down.
At least it's raining on y'all's parade.
Rupert,sitting this close to
the entire tribe of villains,
it's kind of a reflection of
where we're at in this game.
This tri is dwindling,they're
still full-- so to spe.
Literally and physically,they are.
You know,the line between hero
andville slan so blurred right now,
he villains are showing the heroes
how this game is supposed to be played.
James,let's talk about
today's challenge.
There's a bi sortof
question suounding you.
Was there any talk
about "you did great,man,
i'm so glad wek" or w
there even a question?
There were questions.
I had to race j.t. and i lost.
- Whoa,you raced sglat
- i really want the best for the tribe
and i don't want to obligatenybody
to keep me over there.
So i'm like th,let's go
get it,let's have a race.
Well,i sucked and the
dude from alabama beat me.
Amanda,to be fair,i
think a lot of people
would lose in a foot raceto j.t. .
It's something to consider because
if we have a challenge tomorrow
that's running i mean,it's
on everyone's mind.
Colby,the last few tribal councils you've
been on the outside of the conversations
you've been in disaeement with e vote
and you said sooner
or later it will be me.
What will do you do in a game
like this?Can you scramable?
I went back to camp and s.a.t. down
and had a conversation with james
about how bad we both want to be in this
game because we're the two guys in question.
Did you get the feeling from james
that he definitely
wanted to be in this gam
absoluty and he asked me the same thing.
So,james,you weren't sure.
This is pretty much onef theaddest
survivors ever growing up.
I'm not that old i've been
watching this show forer.
I get here,he got smmed
by the dragon slayer.
Today he got beat by a cripple
and fat tuesday on an obstacle.
It's like finding out
superman isn a big girdle.
You see the muscles and get up close
and it's nothing but a fat suit
honestly,doou want to be here?
If not,i'll stay here.I like it here.
Some of us are doers and
some of us are sayers.
I'm more of a doer.
They told me today there's such
a thing as a banana etiquette.
Bananaetiquette?
F you go get a banana,you have
to ask everybody in ur vicinity
if they would like a banana.
Which is great but in my
world if your ass is is hungry,
you go get a banana.
Colby,what's it like to hear james say
it's like seeing superman
is wearing a fat suit.
I mean,earing that's certainly
not as bad as living it.
You know,that's the worst.
I mean,it's a reality.It's a reality.
Up to this point i have not performed
as well as i would have hoped to.
A right,it's time to get to the vote
which means villainsinish
which wt's in your mouth,
grab your torches,head back to camp.
Oh,my god,there's bread up the.
All right,andice,you have

Next week,an all new
"survivor" returns to thursday.
Without hiidol,nothing can save
