        In a totally unpredictable season,
only one thing was certain...
He's threatening Russell Hantz.
When do that, you go.
- Anyone who targeted Russell...
- Watch your back man.
- Same thing for you man.
found themselves blindsided instead...
Tyson, Boston Rob, Coach, Courtney.
The tribe has spoken.
He achieved his goals
with lies and deceptions.
This is where I stand.
Hook, line, and sinker.
The only person to cross
Russell and still survive...








I trust you.
was Sandra.
Whatever Russell says, he's lying.
Behind his back she
convinced the Heroes to join
forces with her and take him out.
You want Russell gone?
Russell's gone.
But Candice saw an opportunity
to further her own game
and joined up with Russell
warning him he was in trouble.
♪♪♪
With her plans betrayed,
Sandra was forced to rejoin the Villains.
You're saying you're going to vote for me?
No, I'm not gonna vote for you.








At tribal council,
a frightened Russell played
the hidden immunity idol.
Russell is super paranoid and
that is going to be his downfall.
Russell wasted his idol
because both Candice and Sandra
voted with the Villains.
Amanda, the tribe has spoken.
Leaving the Heroes in their
toughest position so far.
What they don't know is that tonight,
there will be two immunity challengees,
two tribal councils,
and two more survivors
will meet their fate.
Tribal council is interesting.
Candice, she helped us out and
that one vote, gets some numbers
and now she's a threat,
someone who flips over
that quickly to our side
will just as easily flip-flop back
so we don't really need her anymore.
Candice was a pitiful player,
and she just proved it to me tonight.
She deserved to be on the Villains' tribe.
Colby and I are standing
out on a sinking ship now.
There are no other Heroes.
Now on.
Just Rupert and Colby
are not talking to me.
Their feelings are hurt.
I mean what, game do they think
they're playing, you know what I mean?
I think Russell is a deceitful person,
and anything he says is a lie.
He could be worse than
Johnny fair play. He is.
With all that building up inside
of me, I have to say something
this morning to Russell.
My only hope is to show the
Villains that disgusting side
and ask them truly do they
want to be involved in that?
I'll tell you what, man.
You've already proven yourself
to be a disgusting, terrible
human being to swear on your kids' life.
Well, you know what, Rupert?
It is the game, and
you are really *** yourself.
If you want to swear on your
kids' life and call it
the game, that's fine.
I've played the game twice.
People see I'm not that liar.
Do you think I care about
how I look to you as a man?
I think you don't give
a damn about anything.
- I don't give a fuck about you...
- I know, I don't think you give a
damn about anybody but yourself
and your team should know that.
Rupert I'm a Villain.
****. The great powerful
Rupert, the good guy.
The second coming of Christ.
You can say whatever you want.
Because it doesn't really matter anymore.
You're such a dumb ass Rupert.
I don't want Rupert here because
Rupert's sitting there trying to
stir up stuff, trying to make me mad.
I'm just telling him, pack your
stuff, partner. Pack your stuff.
Get your tie-dye ready
because you're going home.
Come on in, guys!
- You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
- Yes.
Today you are not playing for reward.
You're playing for immunity.
One of you going home
tonight at tribal council.
First things first, Jerri.
You know I've got to take it back.
It was fun while it lasted.
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge,
you will be standing barefoot
on a small wooden perch
with your arm raised about your head.
Your hand will be tethered to a bucket.
Had your hand drops, the bucket tips,
you're out of the challenge.
Last person left standing wins immunity.
To make it interesting,
I will tempt you by
offering you food items.
One other thing... a twist
which will be revealed at
the end of this challenge.
Take your positions.
We'll get started.
All right, this challenge is under way.
Rupert competed in a
variation of this challenge.
Lasted a couple of hours.
Parvati won this challenge in
"Fans versus Favorites,"
lasting over six hours.
But there's one difference...
the perch you're on
today is a new addition.
It makes it a little tougher.
All right, are you guys
ready to be tempted?
I want it, Jeff.
You want out.
You don't even know what it is?
I don't care, whatever it is, I want it.
I want it, too, Jeff.
So, wait, Sandra and Russell
you both want it without seeing?
I don't care what it is.
Step down then.
For real?
Step down.
Sandra and Russell one
minute into a challenge on
day 31 with immunity on the line
voluntarily step out of the
challenge for an unknown item.
I don't care.
Here's what you're sharing.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
Cookies and milk, oatmeal
raisin, chocolate chip.
Oh, my God!
Oh, these cookies are great.
You guys don't know what you're missing.
Down to six, just like that.
Uh-oh. He's back.
Next item.
Donuts!
Oh, my God!
Four donuts and an iced coffee.
- Dam.
- I'll give you guys 30 seconds to
think about this before I give
them to Sandra and Russell.
All right, I'll take it, Jeff.
Colby wants it.
Anybody else want in?
Drop out, Donaldson.
Ninja turtle style.
- All yours brother.
- Thanks.
We are down to five people
left in this challenge.
I have another item.
Let's see if I can get
somebody to give up immunity.
What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly.
Peanut butter jelly sandwiches, chips,
a big bowl of candy, two glasses of milk.
- I think I'm gonna take this one.
- I wanna take it.
I'll take it.
So Danielle, Candice and Jerri
are all coming down to
share this. Step off.
Your pant just came off.
I hate you bitches.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
chips, big bowl of candy, two glasses of milk.
How is it, ladies?
Best sandwich I ever had.
And just like that, we're down to two.
Parvati on one end,
Rupert on the other, both
fighting for immunity.
We could be here a long time.
Been out here over an hour.
There he goes.
Damn it!
Rupert drops out of the challenge.
Parvati wins immunity.
Congratulations.
Good work Rupert.
What happened, Rupert?
I slipped.
I could have made it hours.
So I go home tonight.
Parvati, congratulations.
Thank you, Jeff.
This challenge likes you, and you like it.
I love this challenge.
Parvati wins this challenge once again.
Parvati is safe at
tonight's tribal council,
guaranteed a one-in-seven
shot of winning
this game for the second time.
All right, guys, now to the twist
I mentioned at the
start of this challenge.
This is a clue to a hidden
immunity idol at your camp.
"All hope is not lost
if you suffer defeat.
Salvation is hidden where two paths meet.
A burning bush throws a shadow
on top of a stone under which
lies the key to not going home."
Have a fun afternoon.
I will see you tonight at tribal council.
At the challenge, Jeff read
a clue to the immunity idol.
So the minute we get to camp,
all of a sudden, people
just started running.
We're going to have to split up.
You all go on that one.
Parvati!
The clue said, "there will be a
burning bush, and in the shadow,
there will be the immunity idol."
Is this a burning bush?
It's red, isn't it?
I thought it was like a bush on fire.
There's no bush on fire.
What the hell is a burning bush?
What's this thing?
A dead tree.
It's just a dead tree.
Candice and Russell started digging
where there's this big red
bush, but across from there,
there's another big red bush,
so I start digging, and I see it.
Let me see what it says.
I can't believe I finally found something.
I'm nervous.
I can't read this out here.
I don't know where to
put this. It's too big.
Oh, no, it's too bully.
You think it's on these trails?
Well, I mean, these aren't
really trails, right?
Even though I don't have the idol,
maybe I can play like a do.
I stuck me a rock in my pocket,
making it look a little dangly,
a little big.
This isn't my first game of "Survivor."
I'm just trying to stay in it another day.
What is happening, Rupe?
Yeah.
I have a lot of experience with idols.
Rupert has a big, bulky
thing in his pocket.
It's the idol wrapped up in the paper.
Now we have to get rid of the
idol, so how we going to do this?
It's easy.
We'll split the votes tonight.
If he don't play it, he goes home.
That's how we'll do it.
I think everybody pretty much gave up.
He found it.
I see it in his pocket.
I know exactly how they look.
And I know exactly how
they look in the pocket.
Russell swears that Rupert found the idol.
Of course I know that's a lie
because I have the freaking immunity idol.
And if they think Rupert has
it, that's good for Sandra.
So I'm not going to say nothing.
- So let's split the votes, three and three.
- Why?
To get the idol out of Rupert's hands.
We have to flush it out.
Oh, right.
So we have to split the votes.
Colby and Candice are both
threats in different ways,
that's why it was... it's a hard decision.
Candice voted with us to vote
out Amanda, and I really think
she's going to stay loyal to us.
Colby is not really doing any
kind of strategizing so I feel
like I can get him to do
whatever. I don't know, I mean...
Either way, we're rolling the dice.
Right now, we need to be safe, make
sure that idol's out of Rupert's hands.
Here's how it's gonna work.
They're gonna split the votes tonight
because they've got six of them, right?
So they're going to send
half of them your way,
and the other half
they're either going to go
towards me or towards Candice.
If three of them vote for Candice,
then you and I vote for Candice,
there's five votes for Candice.
Even if three of them vote for
you and you don't have the idol...
It's still five votes for Candice.
I could be going home tonight
if it doesn't work, but if it does,
me and you get to vote Candice ****.
You know, we still got a shot.
We'll now bring in the
members of our jury.
Coach, Courtney, J.T., and Amanda,
voted out at the last tribal council.
All right, Rupert, let's pick
up with the last tribal council.
Amanda's voted out.
You all go back to camp.
What's the fallout?
The fallout was we realized
there's only two Heroes left.
There's Colby and I.
Candice jump to the Villains' side.
Candice, you're shaking your head.
Is that not true?
It was obvious that Amanda
was going to go home whether I
voted for her or not.
You know, Amanda had a target on
her back because she's a strong,
strategic player.
So it wasn't like my vote was
the nail in the coffin to send her home.
The numbers were already there.
I have no respect for the excuses.
It's not gonna get me any
further in the game to go down
on a sinking ship.
Well, then that's what you should
have said, that right there.
That's exactly right.
This is a game for a million dollars.
This was my best play.
So Russell as a strategy,
Candice put herself ahead of
Colby and Rupert and that will
keep her in the game longer.
Good move.
Yeah, it's her best move.
She goes to the Villains' side
at number six, and unless you're
going to give all the Villains
a million dollars, something has
to break within the Villains, so
she could have made a great move.
So if history repeats,
now we're looking at Rupert
or Colby in trouble tonight.
What am I supposed to say?
I'm going to get rid of my
Villain partners out here?
That ain't going to happen.
We've got two Heroes who
has to go sooner or later,
and the consensus is that Rupert goes, so...
Rupert, after the challenge was over,
I read a clue where
another idol was hidden.
You get back to camp.
What happens?
We got home from our challenge.
I calmly took my sandals off
and went for a walk in the jungle.
And stayed until I felt comfortable.
So, Russell, you think
that idol's out there or
you think Colby or Rupert has the idol?
If they don't, then they gave up.
And I don't think Colby
or Rupert would give up.
All right, let's get to the vote.
Parvati has the immunity necklace.
Cannot vote for Parvati.
Everybody else is fair game.
Colby, you're up.
I can honestly say I'm proud
of the way I played this game. Can you?
My mom always told me if you
don't have something nice to say,
don't say anything at all.
I'll tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out will be asked to
leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote.
Once the votes are read
the decision is final.
The person voted out will be asked to
leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Rupert.
Rupert. That's two votes Rupert.
Rupert. That's three votes Rupert.
Candice. One vote Candice.
Candice. That's three votes
Rupert, two votes Candice.
Candice. We're tied, three votes
Rupert, three votes Candice.
That's four votes Candice, three
votes Rupert, one vote left.
13th person voted out and the
fifth member of our jury, Candice.
You need to bring me your torch.
Candice. The tribe has spoken.
Good luck, you guys.
Time for you to go.
Well, maybe the lesson learned
from tonight's tribal council is
this... it's a risky move when you
betray trust in order to gain trust.
Grab your torches. Head
back to camp. Good night.
I definitely got thrown
under the bus tonight.
But I understand.
I made a risky move yesterday.
And it didn't pay off, so I
guess karma's bitch sometimes.
We just blew it.
We were supposed to split
the vote for Rupert and Colby.
And it didn't happen. It
was a terrible decision.
The girls got their heart
involved in the game,
wanted Candice out of here
because they didn't like her,
so everybody blew it, and I'm one of them.
I should have sat them down and said,
"no, this is what we're gonna do."
I'm not fully in control of this game now.
Me and Parvati are equally in control
and that makes me a little worried.
But you know what?
I'm going to take control
of this game so fast,
they won't even know what hit them.
Come on in, guys!
Guys ready to get to
today's immunity challenge?
Yeah.
First things first,
Parvati it looks like
you're ready to give it up.
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you will
each race to get a peg that you
will use to maneuver through a table maze.
The first five to finish
move on to the next round
where you will use four
individually shaped tags
to help you get to the top
of a tall climbing wall.
The first three to move
to the top of the wall
move on to the final round where
you must solve a slide puzzle.
The first person to finish the puzzle
wins immunity and is
guaranteed a one in six shot
at winning this game and
the million-dollar check.
Losers, tribal council, where after
33 days, somebody will be sent home.
We'll draw for spots
and we'll get started.
Here we go.
First round.
Survivors ready? Go!
You've got to dig up your peg
and then get it through the table maze.
Rupert has his and he's
off to a fast start.
Parvati, Sandra, Danielle have theirs.
Russell's got his.
Jerri has her peg.
Everybody on the maze but Colby.
Colby now has his peg and
a lot of time to make up.
Rupert was out very quickly.
Russell now doing a good job on the maze.
Rupert very close.
Sandra getting close.
Rupert's through.
Rupert moving on.
Sandra moving on.
I can't believe it.
Russell's moving on.
Parvati moving on.
One spot left.
Three people vying for it.
Jerri, Danielle, and Colby.
Danielle very close.
Danielle moving on.
Moving on to the next round.
It's Rupert, Sandra, Parvati,
Danielle, and Russell.
First three to the top
of the wall move on.
Survivors ready? Go!
You have four pegs.
Use them as you want.
You don't have to use any of them.
Russell gets himself halfway
up the wall by just running.
Rupert trying to run up the wall.
You're gonna have to run harder than that.
Meanwhile, Parvati is moving up the wall.
Danielle making steady progress.
Russell climbing up this wall.
Using only two pegs so far.
Russell very close to the top.
Russell to the top.
Russell's moving on.
Two more spots.
Rupert making up for lost time.
Parvati very close.
Rupert to the top.
He moves on.
Parvati to the top, she moves on.
It is Russell, Parvati, and Rupert.
In the final round for immunity.
Now how do I get down?
All right, here we go.
The final round.
For immunity.
Survivors ready? Go!
It's a slide puzzle.
That means you can't pick up the pieces.
You have to slide them around.
Building that very
familiar "Survivor" logo.
Don't slow down.
Don't lose your concentration.
Focus on finishing this puzzle.
Russell starting to get
it together a little bit.
Rupert's now starting to
come together with his puzzle.
Parvati falling out of it.
Russell much closer now.
Rupert very close.
We are neck and neck.
Jeff: Russell thinks he has it.
Russell wins immunity!
Way to go, Russell!
Russell, come on over.
Good job, Russell.
Russell safe tonight at tribal council.
For the rest of you,
after 33 hard-fought days,
somebody going home tonight.
Grab your stuff up and head back to camp.
See you at tribal. Congrats.
I was thinking as I walked
out of that darn challenge,
you made it so far,
and still came up short.
I have to believe in myself
because just the lie of a rock
in your pocket is not
gonna save you tonight.
I want Rupert to go home tonight.
He is a hero.
He is not part of our
original tribe of Villains.
And I'm pretty sure Rupert
does not have the idol.
So, yeah, I don't feel
bad for Rupert at all.
I think he's kind of dug his own grave.
The Villains vision happened, and now the Villains are
riding this place, there ain't going to be any Heroes left,
no Heroes.
Seriously.
I mean, we need to be strong, five.
And get those two off because if those...
one of those guys makes it to the
end, none of us stand a chance.
It has to be five Villains and that's it.
I know that.
Honestly, right now, we're
set up pretty good because
Rupert can go home, Colby's not
good in challenges and he
can go home next. You know.
Parvati and Danielle, to me they're a team.
When it's supposed to be me and Parvati.
And that's a problem.
So the only thing I can think of
right now is to break up that couple.
You really think so.
I wouldn't take her to the finals.
She might try to get rid of
you or try to get rid of me.
That's gonna come.
If she tries to get rid of either of us,
you know, we can easily bounce her.
Russell brought up that he
wants to get rid of Parvati,
but I don't know if we should do that.
You know, Parvati's been my
alliance since the beginning,
and, like, if we are
ever going to do that...
which I don't know if I am
because I'm in a tight
alliance with her...
but if we are, now is not the time.
I trust you like 110%.
I don't have any worries about you.
I trust you, too.
Danielle came to me.
She wants to vote you off when
it comes down to five or six.
Why would she want to do that?
And I ain't messing with you Parvati.
Like I told you, my loyalty
lies with you in this game,
and that's it.
I'm working Danielle.
I'm working Parvati.
I'm telling Parvati we've
got to get rid of Danielle.
I'm telling Danielle we've
got to get rid of Parvati.
So by working both of them, I've
got both of them under control.
Parvati's not gonna tell Danielle.
Danielle is not going to tell Parvati.
Because it will mess up both their games.
I want to talk to her.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You can't just come to me and tell me
my final three from day one wants me out.
And you think I'm not gonna talk to her?
I'm not going to tell
her you told me that.
I want to know what she's saying.
Parvati, if you do that,
you're out of this game.
I promise you.
Are you serious? You're gonna go tell her
exactly what I'm trying to keep a secret.
I just told you I'm not
going to say who said it.
You can't even bring it up.
Go ahead. Do what you think
you need to do, Parvati?
I can't believe you're thinking like this?
Thinking like what?
Like I want to have a
conversation with someone.
Don't tell me I can't have
a conversation with someone.
Okay, all right. You go talk to her, then.
You do that.
Today should have been Rupert done.
Russell comes out of nowhere and says,
"they're blindsiding you.
That's what's happening."
I'm like I'm not voting Danielle tonight.
I don't care what you say.
I'm not doing it.
It could be dangerous if
Parvati would talk to Danielle
about what I told her that Danielle
wants to get rid of Parvati.
It could turn into a problem.
He wanted to blindside you.
- He said that to you?
- Yes.
He told me that you came up to him and
said that you wanted to blindside me now
because you don't think
you can win against me
and all this other stuff.
He's such a liar. But I'm
not voting you tonight.
I won't. I refuse.
Russell is trying to vote me out tonight.
- We have to get out Rupert or Colby.
- I know...
He's got this whole thing that
he wants me and you to be like...
I think he's worried if it's final
three and it's you, me,and him
you and I will take each other.
I'm going to get Danielle off tonight
because it eliminates that pair.
As soon as we get rid of Danielle,
Parvati is going to be so scared of me,
she's going to stick to me like glue.
She's going to vote the
way I tell her to vote.
There's only one thing
that has to happen today,
and that's Danielle go home.
Really?
Really?
Yeah.
It's funny how things change in this game.
I know, I know.
How did this get flipped on me?
- It's crazy.
- Why?
Why do we want to keep
Colby and Rupert around?
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does not make sense.
Russell walking around double
talking is hurting his game.
He's getting outplayed by
me and Danielle at this point
and it's making him a little bit crazy.
The only thing we have
to do make sure Jerri
doesn't write your name down.
Jerri.
I'm ripping my hair out.
Do not change your vote tonight
- no matter what he says to you.
- No, I'm not.
He's trying to vote me out.
He's trying to vote her out tonight.
It's Rupert.
Are you crazy?
It's Rupert. He is causing
all this craziness again.
Please, don't write my name down.
I want Danielle gone. Tonight.
We need to get rid of Rupert.
- It's too early to get Danielle.
- Bad move, you're gonna be next.
- Don't threaten me.
- Not because of me.
Not because of me. I'm trying to save you.
If you don't get rid of Danielle,
you're gonna be after her.
- Why do you say that?
- It ain't me, it ain't me.
I can't do nothing. You have to
help me, help you. I think, let me...
I'm telling you now we have
to get rid of Danielle tonight
they will get rid of you.
Now bring in the members of our jury.
Coach.
Courtney... J.T.
Amanda.
And Candice, voted out at
the last tribal council.
Rupert, who's running this show right now.
I don't know.
It's probably between Parvati and Russell.
Danielle, ring true to
you, Russell and Parvati
pretty much guiding the shots
over here for the Villains?
Uhm, I don't necessarily
think that's true.
I think the Villains
make decision together.
Really, this close to a
million dollars, you all agree?
Yeah, we're still together, aren't we?
That doesn't mean you agree.
But we agree voting out the
Heroes and sticking together.
So, Jerri, around camp it
must be fairly peaceful, then,
the Villains all agree on the decisions,
and Rupert and Colby going,
"it's you or me, dude."
Hell no, it's never been quiet
since day one playing this game
and it's certainly not quiet now.
Danielle, why this illusion
that it's one big happy family.
There was just a
miscommunication, Jeff, honestly.
There were things said and, no,
not everybody agreed today, at all.
It was mad chaos.
Crazy could not describe
what happened today.
Craziness, crazy, crazy.
Like unnecessarily out of control.
Danielle and I were
pitted against each other.
We were pitted against each other.
Parvati, what happened?
Well, Russell came to me and
told me that Danielle was
trying to blindside me today.
She said it was not
true. And it went crazy.
And so, Russell's trying to test loyalty.
That's what I got from the whole thing.
So, Russell, you got caught.
No, I didn't get caught doing nothing.
Today, Danielle came up to me
before I said anything and said,
- when do you want to get rid of...
- Liar, liar, liar.
Let me finish talking.
Danielle knows where my loyalty
lies and that's with Parvati.
- If you're going to come up to me
- You've been telling me...
and try to get rid of Parvati,
I'm gonna try to get rid of you.
You sat me on the beach and said you don't
want to go against Parvati in the end.
I wanted to see where you stood,
- Oh really.
- And I exactly found out.
The three of us are in an
alliance so I don't understand why.
I haven't done anything
to be disloyal to him.
I don't understand why he's testing me.
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
What are the tears about right now?
I'm just a frigging wreck.
I'm so exhausted, and I'm just... 
just like... it's too
much for me right now.
I just had a rough day.
We've been in an alliance
since the beginning.
I don't know why he's
trying to mess with it.
Is it feeling personal to you?
- Is that hurting your feelings?
- Yeah!
I don't understand how she's
just putting it all on me.
Why I'm trying to mess with
it and she agreed totally.
Because you were telling
me she wanted to get me off.
What am I supposed to say.
- Can I finish, please!
- No.
- Whatever.
- You're such a liar.
It wouldn't have happened.
It would have happened
- if I would have wanted it to happen.
- It would not have happened.
I'm closer to Parvati than you think.
Oh, really.
- Yeah, really.
- Okay.
Well, that perked you up.
We're all fine right now.
There's no need for us to
continue with this conversation.
It's been resolved.
At least, it was resolved today.
It just got reopened when you said
you're closer to Parvati
than Russell thinks.
He is underestimating, like, my
friendship and my loyalty to her
and I don't like that so
I'm just letting him know
that I would never do that to her.
All right, them let's get to the vote.
Russell has the immunity necklace.
Cannot vote for Russell.
Everybody else is fair game.
Danielle, you're up.
Okay, second time's a charm, right?
Hopefully you're going home tonight.
You're closer to Parvati than I think.
That makes me think y'all
got something going on,
so I'm going to have to cut that tie.
I have absolutely no
idea what just happened
but with this vote, I'm sealing my fate.
I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.
All right, once the vote are
read, the decision is final.
Person voted out will be asked to leave
the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote.
Rupert.
Rupert. Two votes Rupert.
Rupert. Three votes Rupert.
Danielle.
Three votes Rupert, one vote Danielle.
Danielle.
That's three votes
Rupert, two votes Danielle.
Danielle. We're tied.
Three votes Danielle, three votes Rupert.
One vote left.
14th person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury,
Danielle.
You need to bring me your torch.
Danielle, the tribe has spoken.
Bye.
So here's what we learned tonight...
the Villains are clearly
not one, big, happy family.
Colby and Rupert live to see another day,
and it is anybody's game.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
Next time on "Survivor"... 
I'm against you, Russell.
Russell is on the outs with the Villains.
So he tries to turn the
Heroes to the dark side.
Greatest Villain, the greatest hero.
I want to trust you all
the way to the final three.
