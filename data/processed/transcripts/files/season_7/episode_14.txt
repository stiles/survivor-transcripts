         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 16
Americans began the adventure of
a lifetime.
Wearing only their street
clothes, they journeyed
south off the coast of Panama
to the Pearl Islands,
where they were met
with a big surprise.
You're going into this game
with the clothes you have
on your back,
just like if you
really were shipwrecked.
They were given
100 Panamanian dollars
and abandoned
near a small fishing village,
where they bargained
for supplies.
 Rice? Rice?








 Rice.
 PROBST: Right from the
beginning, the Morgan Tribe
was scattered and frantic.
 Give me my money back.
Money. I need my money back.
I don't want it.
 PROBST: While the Drake Tribe
pulled together
and worked every advantage.
(speaking Spanish)
 Sandra was so amazing
in the town, because she spoke
the language.
 Pirates steal.
Pirates take advantage.
All their trade goods,
all the little women's shoes,
everything that I could find
in theirs, I took.
 PROBST: Once at camp, the
Drakes continued to prosper,
and Rupert emerged
as their natural provider.
 I got lunch!
 Yeah!
 PROBST: The Morgan Tribe
struggled and faced setback








after setback.
 Oh, my God.
I just lost the hook.
 We are absolutely devastated.
I think it's us against
everything else out here.
 PROBST: In the first 11 days,
the Drakes won six challenges
in a row.
Drake wins immunity!
 Yeah!
 PROBST: And the already weak
Morgan Tribe lost three members.
Morale at the Morgan camp
was so low that Osten
contemplated quitting.
 Vote me right off,
'cause I don't deserve to win.
 PROBST: Eventually,
disharmony set in at Drake as
well and they deliberately
threw a challenge
to get rid of one of their own.
Morgan wins immunity!
But it was a decision
that changed the game.
The defeat sent the Drakes
into a tailspin
and, over the next nine days,
they lost three members,
making the tribes even
at five each.
On day 19, both Drake and Morgan
were blindsided by a twist.
Your past has come
back to haunt you.
The six castaways
who had been voted out
returned as a tribe
of Outcasts to compete
against Drake and Morgan
for a chance
to return to the game.
 Revenge, baby.
All about revenge.
 PROBST: If you really are
the ten most worthy Survivors,
this should be no trouble.
Everybody's got
to cross the finish line.
Got to have the tribe flag.
(screaming and cheering)
The Outcasts defeat
Morgan and Drake!
The Outcasts beat both tribes,
forcing Drake and Morgan
to separate Tribal Councils.
Shawn was voted
out of the Drake Tribe.
And Osten became the first
Survivor ever to quit the game.
 Yeah, I'm quitting.
My health to me
is more important
than a million dollars,
I guess, right now.
 PROBST: Osten, per your
wishes...
go home.
All due respect to Osten,
people work too damn hard
to get in this game
and fight to stay alive.
If he wants to lay his torch
down, so it shall be.
The Outcasts voted
Lill and Burton back in
and they both returned
to their former camps.
On day 21, the game changed
again when the two tribes
merged.
They became the Balboas.
 Balboa!
 Balboa!
(cheering)
 I knew that here is
where the true game starts.
 PROBST: Old alliances broke
down when Lill jumped ship
and helped vote out
her former tribe mate, Andrew.
Ryno was the next to go.
 I'll be back, guys.
> PROBST: Former Outcasts Lill
and Burton made a pact to stay
together.
 To the Outcasts.
 To the Outcasts.
 Taking it home.
 Uh-huh.
 PROBST: And Rupert, Christa
and Sandra continued their
friendly bond.
 They are so power-ridden,
they know it.
 PROBST: Uneasy with the power
that Rupert seemed to have,
Jon and Burton formed
a tight alliance of two.
 You and I will go all the
way.
I know.
 PROBST: Together, they
launched a plot with Darrah,
Tijuana and Lill to eliminate
their biggest threat.
And on day 27,
Rupert was voted out,
leaving Sandra and Christa
to fend for themselves.
 I cannot believe that.
 PROBST: Rupert, the tribe has
spoken.
T, here's your high school
sweetheart.
On day 28, the Survivors'
loved ones showed up
to participate
in a reward challenge.
(sobbing)
And Jon got some devastating
news from his friend, Dan.
In a show of sympathy,
the tribe let Jon win
so that he could spend time
with his friend.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Of course. Of course.
 PROBST: But it was all a big
lie.
 That was a brilliant
performance, sir.
My grandmother's sitting home
watching Jerry Springer
right now.
I haven't even come close
to being voted off, dude.
 Jon called me before he left
and was like,
"If you come down here,
tell me my grandma died."
 The fake dead grandmother
could easily go down
as the dirtiest thing
ever to be done in this game.
 PROBST: Jon continued
to plot with Burton.
And, even though
Sandra and Tijuana
secretly listened in
on their conversation,
the men continued
to dominate the game,
as Jon convinced his enemies
to vote out Tijuana.
The tribe has spoken.
The women considered
forming their own alliance
to overthrow Jon and Burton.
 I want the guys to go.
 Yeah, yeah.
 You think that'll work?
 PROBST: But when Jon left the
camp with Lill and Darrah
for a reward, he again
worked his deception.
He convinced Lill and Darrah
to vote out Christa.
Last week, Burton won the
reward and chose to take Jon
to the old Panama ruins
for an overnight feast,
where he and Jon celebrated
their control of the game.
 To the girls eating mussels.
 To the girls eating mussels.
 PROBST: But back at camp,
the women rekindled
talk of an alliance.
 So, if Burton wins immunity,
Jon's going.
Right?
 Right.
 PROBST: When Jon and Burton
returned, they were immediately
suspicious.
 I can't believe you three
didn't try to figure out
a girl alliance to go
against Jon and me.
 Nope.
 PROBST: And Sandra used Jon's
strategy against him when she
told her own lie.
 I swear on my grandmother.
I swear. I swear. I swear.
Now you guys have a plan or not?
 I swear on my two kids
that I'm with you guys.
In my head, I was like,
"I swear on my kids that I'm
going to screw you and Burton."
 PROBST: At the challenge,
Darrah took home
her third straight immunity.
And at Tribal Council, the
all-girl alliance finally held
and Burton was voted out.
Burton, for the second time,
the tribe has spoken.
Now, only four remain.
Tonight, they will compete
in their final
immunity challenges.
Two will continue on
to face the jury.
One will outlast all the rest
and become the Sole Survivor.

(boat engine rumbling)
 You guys, get up.
 PROBST: Rise and shine.
Day 37 is here.
Jon and three women in bed,
another first.
 Actually, not really.
 PROBST: Good morning, guys.
 Wow.
 PROBST: Well, I figured 37
days and the final four
is cause for celebration, so...
Oh, my God.
Some pastries and we'll
make some mimosas.
Oh, Lill. Lill.
 I'm sorry.
 PROBST: Thank you.
 I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm so hungry.
 PROBST: Here we go-- Day 37
and the final four.
Congratulations to the final
four.
 Final four.
 PROBST: Cheers.
 Cheers.
 Man, that's good.
 PROBST: I have one more
thing, before I leave, for you
guys-- I'll go grab it.
 You rule.
 God, I love that man.
 He goes from good to bad.
 I wonder if he'd like to join
a troop.
 Oh, our letters.
 Don't say that.
 Or a challenge.
 It's our letters.
 It's our challenge.
 No, it's not.
It's four letters.
 It's four somethings.
Do we get something good?
 PROBST: Well, home is
only three days away,
so, hopefully, a little love
from home will tide you over.
Letters from home.
I'll leave and let you guys sit
down.
Share these if you want
or keep them private.
Have a good last three days.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 PROBST: All right, Lill.
 Thank you.
You want to join
a Boy Scout troop?
(laughs)
 PROBST: Someday.
I'll leave you guys in private.
See you later.
 Thank you.
Oh.
This is to Jeff.
(Lillian gasps)
 Jeff brought back four
envelopes and they had our
letters in them from home.
So, we just all sat down
and started reading our letters.
It's hard because you haven't
talked to anybody in 37 days.
I was just mainly worried about
if my dog was okay and,
you know, my family.
 I got four letters from home:
one from my husband,
my two girls and my mom.
So, I started crying because
you can't help but to cry.
It really felt good
at a time like this
when you got so many
other things on your mind,
and you do worry
about your family.
And then, to get a letter and
know that everything's okay--
okay, fine, then I don't have
to worry about them anymore.
Now, it's time to focus
on the end of the game.
 "Hey, Mom...
"everything is fine here at
home.
"I think about you every day...
and pray for your safe
and happy return."
(Lillian sobbing)
"Win or lose, I love you."
Having those letters
from my three family members
made me realize
that I have to keep going.
I have to be strong for them.
"'Someone has to win
and someone has to lose.
"I believe in letting
someone else lose.'
That's by Pete Rose."
This is my son.
 Oh, my God.
(sobbing)
 Lill went into such theatrics
over her letter,
that it pretty much overshadowed
anyone else's letter.
(moans)
That's been her M.O. from the
beginning.
Of course, Lill
will break down into hysterics
and I hope to use that against
her, hopefully, to show D.
and Sandra, if she does this
in front of a final jury,
you're screwed.
So, have you guys made
a deal amongst yourselves
for final three?
You can be honest.
I take that as a "yes."
It is my head on the chopping
block.
It seems pretty obvious that...
that the three of them have
formed some kind of bond
because, you know, all three
share inferiority complexes
to that of a man.
The fact that Sandra jumped
ahead of me on the food chain
pisses me off to no end.
 I don't want to be third.
I want to be first or second.
 Of course you want to be
first or second, 'cause if
you're anywhere near that
freakin' jury, you're going to
win and you know it.
 I am not going to win.
 Y-you can say, "I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know,"
but everyone here knows.
 That is not true.
> Yes, it is-- you're going to
pull hearts and flowers
like you did this morning.
That was just rehearsal
for later.
 What do you mean
"hearts and flowers"?
 Okay.
 You don't think
that they won't go by skills...
 Nope. Nope.
 ... by strategy?
 They're going to go by
you sitting there crying, that's
what they're going to go by.
And D. and Sandra are
banking on that, because I think
they're smart enough to know not
to take you to the final.
 Is that true, D.?
 I'm not getting in
the middle of this.
 I'm asking you,
do I have your vote?
 It's going to be
a lot to think about.
I mean, you'll get
more votes than I will.
But I'm fine with
first or second.
 But would you
take me to the end?
 I don't know, Lill.
There's a lot to think about.
You know, I can't sit here
and tell you that I will take
you, and I can't sit here
and tell you I won't take you.
And if I do take you, I'm
going to get my butt kicked.
 So, you're planning
on taking Sandra.
 I don't know what
I'm going to do.
 Darrah told me,
"You're a nice person, Lill,
but I'm not going to take you
to the final two."
 Lill, are you mad at me?
 No, I'm going to go over
here...
 No, I want to talk to you.
 I want to be left alone,
okay? I'm sorry...
if that makes me mean.
Nobody wants to go
to the jury with me,
'cause they think I'm nice.
They all think I'm going to get
voted for because I'm nice.
I'm just screwed
all the way around.
 No one can beat that woman,
and you know it.
 And she knows it.
And she shouldn't sit here
and pressure me, "Oh, well,
you going to take me?"
"Are you going to take me--
tell me right now."
Hell, I don't know
if I'm even going to be here.
 I can guarantee
that you'll be here
if me you and Sandra
get rid of her tonight.
So, all it takes is for
you to talk to Sandra, that's
it, and Lill's ... gone.
 You really can't trust Jon.
You don't know
if he's lying or not.
But, I-I think my best bet
would probably...
me and Jon and Sandra.
Lill is only looking out
for herself.
She's being selfish. She...
all she wants is to win
just like everybody else.
And she thinks everybody
should take her to the end,
because she knows that
she would whip our tails.
 Okay, so, if Jon was
to win Immunity tonight,
then it would be Lill?
 I think if...
even if he doesn't win.
 We went to get water and
Darrah was just talking about,
"We need to get rid of Lill."
"I think it would be good
to keep Jon," um...
because he would be perfect
to go into the Final Two."
So, now, she's thinking Jon.
Fine.
It could be Lill
as long as it's not me.
I come back, Darrah takes off.
Now, Lill comes to me
with her own strategy.
 Can I... talk?
 What do you need?
 I want to talk to you without
ears here.
 Oh. For Jon to go bye-bye?
 Okay.
 Will you get out of here?
 Sure.
 D. keeps winning... we're...
we're sunk.
We have a better shot at
Immunity the next time around,
physically, 'cause I can't do
it.
 If she wasn't there?
 If she wasn't there.
'Cause she's going to keep
winning these things.
 Anything to keep myself
longer in the game.
I want to be in the game, too.
 Okay.
Then it's done.
 We've got to let him know.
'Cause he might vote
against me or you tonight.
So, he's got to know.
 Well, call him back.
Jon?
The decision's been finalized.
Go ahead, Lill,
tell him.
 Our whole thing is we want
to get along as far as possible.
We two are not
physically able
to compete with her,
as far as Immunity Challenges.
 Agreed.
 If she doesn't
make Immunity...
 She's gone.
 She's gone.
 Okay. I can...
I can accept that.
 You'll accept that?
 Whenever you're in the
hot seat and someone's
ready to vote you off,
create tension between
two other people
and those people...
those two people's heads
usually end up
on the chopping block.
Case-in-point, tonight:
it's either D. or Lill.
Isn't that crazy?
 All right, enough said then.
As it stands now,
if either Darrah or Lill
wins Immunity,
then the other one goes.
I really don't give a damn
which one of the two goes,
as long as it ain't me.
 Got sea mail!
 Come this way.
 "So, here you are,
the final four.
"But, after tonight,
you'll lose one more.
"So, head to Tribal Council
like you always do.
Your peers and your fate
are waiting for you."
 The tree mail came and, uh,
it said something about
just head out
to Tribal Council as usual.
"That your peers and your fate
will be determined," I guess,
by the "peers,"
meaning the jury.
So everyone's
kind of freaking out.
 I don't care if
it's a physical challenge
or a mental challenge tonight.
I'm the king of men
and they're women.
There's a huge difference.
I mean, like, you know...
if it's a getting-pregnant
contest, yeah, they could...
they could probably win,
but other than that, no.
Mentally, physically, I got...
I can beat any of them.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
I can beat any of them.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury:
Ryno, Rupert, T.
Christa and Burton,
voted out at
the last Tribal Council.
Okay.
At tonight's Tribal Council,
we will vote out the 13th member
from your tribe.
They will become
the sixth member of the jury.
But before we get
to Tribal Council,
we have an Immunity Challenge
to take care of.
So, Darrah,
need to get that back.
Immunity is back up for grabs,
and tonight
it truly is up for grabs.
Once again,
the ghosts of your past
will play a role in this game.
Here's how it's going to work.
The four of you will compete
as individuals for Immunity.
In addition, the jury
will compete as a group
in this Immunity Challenge.
If the jury wins,
Immunity has no value to them,
but it has
a huge consequence to you,
because nobody
will have Immunity
when we go into
tonight's Tribal Council.
And, as many
surprise Tribal Councils
and blindsided votes
as you guys have had,
Immunity probably
has never had as much value
as it does tonight.
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions
based on survival
and pirate folklore.
The first to five wins Immunity.
For the jury,
you'll come up with one answer.
So, you'll be deciding
by committee.
Could work for you,
could work against you.
Ready?
First question:
"According to your
Pearl Islands Survival Guide,
"which of the following elements
is not one of the three sides
"represented in the fire
triangle?
"A) Friction...
"B) Heat...
"C) Air...
or D) Fuel?"
Which one of
the following elements
is not one of the three sides
represented
in the fire triangle?
All right, we'll start
with you, Darrah, reveal.
Darrah says, "D) Fuel."
Lill says, "A) Friction."
Sandra says, "D) Fuel."
Jon says, "A) Friction."
Jury?
"A) Friction."
Correct answer: A) Friction.
Lill had it right,
Jon had it right,
Jury had it right.
Next question:
"In what year did the pirate
Captain Henry Morgan
loot the city of Panama?
A) 1492...
B) 1671...
C) 1675...
or D) 1776?"
Everybody have it?
Darrah, reveal.
Darrah says, "B) 1671."
Lill, "C) 1675."
Sandra says, "1671."
Jon says "C) 1675."
The jury says "B) 1671."
Correct answer: 1671.
B is correct.
Sandra has it right.
Darrah has it right.
The jury has it right.
Jury has two.
Darrah, Lill, Sandra, and Jon,
you each have one.
Next question:
"The best way to avoid shark
attacks is to:
"A) Avoid sudden movements,
"B) Never make
direct eye contact,
"C) Cover any open wounds
or cuts,
or D) Don't go in the water?"
Darrah, reveal.
Darrah says, "A)
Avoid sudden movements."
Lill says, "C)
Cover any open wounds."
Sandra says, "A)
Avoid sudden movements."
Jon says, "D)
Just don't go in the water."
Jury says, "A) Avoid sudden
movements--" it figures.
Smart aleck is the one
that gets it.
The best way
to avoid a shark attack:
don't go in the water.
(laughs)
Jon gets it right with "D."
Jon with two right,
the jury with two right.
Everybody else with one.
Next question:
"True or false:
the Pacific is considered
the largest ocean in the world."
Darrah.
Darrah says, "True."
Lill says, "True."
Sandra says, "True."
Jon says, "True."
The jury says, "True."
Everybody's right.
Jon and the jury
still tied at three.
Sandra, Lill, Darrah at two.
Next question:
"When aboard a sea vessel,
which side does the term
"starboard" refer to?
"A) Front,
"B) Right, C) Back,
or D) Left?"
Darrah.
Darrah says, "A) Front."
Lill says, "A) Front."
Sandra says, "D) The left."
Jon says, "A) The front."
Jury says, "B."
The jury has it right.
It is the right side
of the boat.
Jury takes the lead.
 Ah.
 PROBST: Jury's at four.
Jon is at three,
everybody else is at two.
That means....
if the jury gets this right,
regardless what
you guys do, jury wins immunity.
Nobody going to have it
at Tribal Council.
Ready?
"Panama is bordered by Colombia
and which other country?
"A) Nicaragua,
"B) Honduras, C) Costa Rica,
or D) Guatemala."
A lot at stake on this question.
I know everybody sitting here
wants immunity.
It may be out of your hands.
Darrah, "D) Guatemala"
is not right.
Lill says, "C."
"C" is correct.
Costa Rica.
Sandra says, "D."
That's not right.
Jon says, "C."
That is right.
Rupert, happy to show me "C."
Costa Rica is right.
Jury wins immunity.
Contest over.
Jury?
I know for some of you
it's a first.
I'll let you
hang onto that tonight.
I'll bring it to the next
immunity challenge with me.
So, Jon,
how big of an impact is it with
nobody having immunity tonight?
 About the same
as it would be, uh...
if anyone had it, I think.
There's a few targets going
into the Council, regardless.
 PROBST: Still feel like
you're a target?
 Definitely.
 PROBST: Tell me about
the letters from home
that I dropped off
at camp today.
It was clear you guys were
excited to get them.
Lill, who was your letter from?
 My letter was from my husband
and my two children.
 PROBST: Nice to have that
love?
 I've been pretty strong.
I have not broken down,
but I have read those letters
so many times today.
It's like, next to God,
they're so important to me.
 PROBST: What's going through
your head, Darrah, in terms of
the strategy for the
last three days?
Is it, "How am I going to make
it to the final three?"
Or do you look further down
and say, "Who's going to be
in the final two with me
and how do I get there?"
 You just have to take
it one day at a time
and just hope for the best.
I don't know if I'll be there at
the final two, so I'm not gonna
start putting who I'd take
to the final two with me,
because I don't know
if I'll be there.
 PROBST: Sandra,
where's your head?
Is it "one day at a time"
or are you thinking
as many moves as you can?
 Um, right now, I think
most... for-for most of the time
that I try my hardest
to just not leave the shelter,
because, the minute you walk
away, there's whispering.
So, it's like, you can't even
take a piss break,
because you know that
the minute you
get up and go, it's...
 PROBST: Lill, hear a lot of
whispering going on behind your
back?
 I take piss breaks.
I figure, if they're
going to be talking,
I'm not going to have
to sit there and baby-sit.
I've already been
told by everyone
that they don't want to go
to the last two with me.
 PROBST: So what do you do
at this point in the game
to combat that feeling?
How do you change their mind?
 These characteristics
are Lillian Morris.
I can't change them.
That's just how I am.
I'm hardworking.
I'm a loyal friend.
Outside of this game, I don't
like what this game has made me.
I hate it.
 PROBST: Darrah, strong case
could be made that you are the
biggest physical threat out
here.
Do you think that
works against you?
Three immunity challenges
in a row.
 No, I don't think
I'm a physical threat.
I mean, you can look at me
and tell that I'm not.
 PROBST: Jon...
what is controlling
your thoughts right now?
Because you could make a case
that you're the most
unlikable person
left in the group.
 Absolutely.
I hope people recognize that.
 PROBST: Well, yeah, it can be
hopeful in that somebody wants
to go to the final two with you
because they think
nobody will vote for you.
The other side of the coin is
you have somebody like Lill
who might say,
"Based on my integrity alone,
I'm not letting a guy like that
even get a shot
at second place."
Does that enter your head?
 Uh, yes, I do
hope that people want to keep me
around, take me to the end.
I have not figured out
how I can win over the jury yet,
but I'm thinking every second
if I were to go.
 PROBST: Okay.
It is time to vote.
Jon, you're up.
 Darrah, you are too strong
of a competitor.
When you told me you wouldn't
take me to the final two
after I've saved you twice now,
I have no choice.
It has to be Darrah this time.
 Lill, I'm voting for you
tonight because I'm just tired
of listening to you whine
and saying that you won't,
uh, win the jury votes,
when you know you will.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave
the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote:
Darrah.
Lill.
One vote Lill,
one vote Darrah.
D. Darrah.
Two votes Darrah,
one vote Lill.
I'll read the last vote.
13th person
voted out of the tribe:
Darrah.
You need to bring me your torch.
Darrah, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Well, with everybody vulnerable
at tonight's Tribal Council,
you chose to vote out
the biggest physical threat,
hopefully, leveling
the playing field a bit
for your final
immunity challenge.
It comes down to this: three
people, two Tribal Councils,
one winner.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
 Well, that sucked.
But, um, you know,
it's pretty bad when
people think that
you're a physical threat
when you weigh
about 60 pounds soaking wet.
Lill and Jon,
you both are snakes.
Lill, you act like you
don't know the game, you know.
It's been a great experience
and I would do it all over
again.
(thunder)
 We'd have had another
immunity, she would
have gotten it.
 Do you think she knew
she was going?
 No, I don't think so.
 I don't either.
 You don't think so?
 No.
 Tonight, at Tribal Council,
we knew where the vote
had to go.
Darrah had won immunity
three times in a row.
And she was still the strongest
one of all of us.
So, um, we all decided
that she would be the one
going home tonight.
So, now, it's down to
Jon, Lill and myself.
 Was I a big target?
 According to D, you were.
 I don't feel so
darn bad after all.
Darrah wanted to get rid of
me.
So tonight at Tribal Council,
it was kind of a blessing
that it worked out
the way it did.
 Sea mail...
in the middle of the night.
Treasure.
Guys.
 What?
 We got sea mail.
 Already?
 Yeah.
 No way.
 You're kidding.
 Yes way.
 "Try to get some rest
because tomorrow's a big day.
The last chapter
of your adventure
begins at Shipwreck Bay.
Arrive at the beach by sunrise.
You'll be greeted on the coast.
Who's guaranteed in the final
two?
The player who wants it most."
 It was the first time we ever
received tree mail at night
and it mentioned
having to go to Pirates Cove
before sunrise.
So that means we're going to be
getting up early, early, early
and heading off to a challenge.
 We're leaving way early
in the morning.
 Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
 This is going to be very
important because this...
it's the last
immunity challenge.
And it's going to decide
what's going to happen
at Tribal Council tomorrow.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Morning, guys.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Morning, guys.
Well, you have lived
within the world of pirates
for the past 38 days,
so, it is only
fitting that you
give a final tribute,
in full pirate style,
to your former tribe members
who are no longer in this game.
You'll take their torches.
One at a time you'll place them
on the shipwreck,
say a few words
about how they
played this game.
You'll then come back here,
take the muskets,
fire upon the shipwreck,
igniting it
in a fiery celebration
honoring those tribe members.
You spent a lot of time
with these people.
Embrace it.
One person did not
finish their game.
Their torch remains
at Tribal Council.
It will not be a part
of this celebration.
When you're finished,
you'll paddle to
your final immunity challenge.
I'll be waiting for you there.
Grab your torches.
Head to the boat.
 Nicole, you were
the first one out.
What a wonderful spirit
you had.
I enjoyed being with you
for those several days
as an Outcast.
I think of you often.
 Rocking body.
 Ryan...
you were my best friend here.
I didn't cry
until you were kicked out.
I miss you a lot.
You are pure of heart.
 Michelle, um, we were
together from day one
and it's a shame
we didn't get to know
each other better.
You were fun-loving
and energetic.
We wish you could have
stuck around longer.
 Trish... you're, uh,
best sleeping partner
a guy can have in this game.
I thought we would have
made it further together.
 Shawn...
you were a great guy
with tons of stories
and you loved to eat.
 Andrew...
you were the leader
of the Morgan tribe.
I know you tried hard
to make sure
everything was done right
and that everybody was fair.
Thank you, Andrew.
 Ryno... I got to know you
in a very short time
and you were
very pleasant and loving.
And, you know,
when you were gone,
I kind of missed you.
 Rupert...
you're one of the greatest guys
to ever play the game.
 Without you, I don't know
how I would have made it.
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be damned starving.
So, um, I'm glad me and you
became really, really tight
and I love you very, very much
and I miss you.
 Tijuana, the night
that you and I
were cast off and was
on the island by ourselves,
you looked at me and told me
thank you for my friendship
and how much you loved me.
That touched my heart greatly.
And I still do love you, too, T.
 Christa, out of everyone
here, I miss you the most.
You know, me and you
were real tight,
and we'll see each other again,
and we'll be buddy-buddy
and it'll be all great.
 Burton...
you became my best friend
in the game.
Unbelievable.
 My Eagle Scout,
I appreciated the time
that we spent together
and I'm amazed
that you still know
the oath and the laws.
Here's to you, sir.
 D, you're as, uh,
nice as you are cute.
I miss you.
 Ready?
I miss you.
 Ready?
Aim.
Fire.
 Oh, my gosh.
Look at that.
 Thank the Lord
that our torches are not
up there burning.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Right this way, guys!
Drop that anchor.
Get on your platform.
Welcome, guys, to your final
immunity challenge.
It's based on
an old pirate torture,
where they would take prisoners,
put them on small rafts,
set them adrift in the ocean,
and leave them for dead.
Today's challenge
will test your ability
to battle fatigue
and the elements.
You're gonna be balancing
on these rafts.
You can use your feet,
and you can use your hands
for balance.
If your bottom or your knees
touch the platform,
you're out.
Last person left standing
on their raft wins immunity
for the final time,
guarantees themself a spot
in the final two, and...
gets to decide
who sits next to them
at the final vote.
I'll give you a minute
to get in position.
We'll get started.
For the last time,
immunity is up for grabs.
This challenge has begun.
Don't let your knees
or your butt touch your raft.
This should go for a long time.
You guys have been
out here for 38 days.
You've proven you can last.
You got a million dollars
at stake.
Lill, with her Boy Scout
uniform;
Jonny Fairplay,
would-be W. W. E. wrestler;
and Sandra, the lippiest mother
we've ever had
represented in the final three.
 Not the final three I think
anyone else envisioned, Jeff.
 PROBST: What are you thinking
about, Sandra?
 Quitters never win,
and winners never quit.
 PROBST: Good.
We're gonna be here
a while, then.
You guys are at 15 minutes.
 15 longest minutes of my
life.
 PROBST: Anybody starting to
feel it at all, or you doing
okay?
 I'm feeling it.
My feet are numb... already.
 PROBST: Lill, how about you?
 I'm feeling really darn good.
 PROBST: No pain?
 A little numbness, but no.
 PROBST: Sandra, worth a
million dollars?
 Worth a million dollars.
 PROBST: It's gonna get a lot
worse than this, you guys.
Some big waves coming in.
Hang tight, guys.
And like that, Sandra is out.
Lill, Jon,
don't lose your concentration.
 Lill, you want to make a deal
right now?
 No, sir.
 You're crazy.
 My daughter wants
to be a doctor.
 Do you understand how...
 Jon, don't talk to me.
 Do you understand
how the deals work, Lill?!
 Shut up.
 Lill, if you give me
immunity, I will take you
to the final two.
That's what... a deal is.
 And if you trust me,
then you jump in.
 I don't know
that I can trust you.
 Then drop it.
 PROBST: Looks like you're
gonna have to win it on your
own, Jon.
You're at 30 minutes.
If the first 15 were the longest
15 of your life, Jon,
how have the second 15 been?
 Oh, these sucked twice as
much.
(Jon laughs)
Lill, who do you want
to go against
in the final two?
 How many people
have you screwed over, Jon?
 Everyone in the game.
 Do you know what?
I do aerobics.
 Okay.
 My knees are great.
 Okay.
 My ankles are great.
 Okay.
 These are called squats in
aerobics.
 Okay. All right.
 PROBST: I think Lill
just said, "Game on."
 I think Lill said, "Game
over. "
 PROBST: Coming up on two
hours you've been out here.
 Ready for a deal?
 I'm not going to deal, honey.
 I'll give you immunity,
if you take me to the final.
 I'm not gonna promise
anything.
 Well, then... that's
that's not a deal, Lill.
 Well, I'm not
gonna deal, then.
 PROBST: Jon, how confident
are you right now about your
chances of winning this?
 Not extremely.
Not at all like this.
 PROBST: Coming up on two
hours, 45 minutes.
Jon's struggling to hang on.
Jon...
is out, lost his balance.
Lill wins her first
and most important immunity.
Nicely done, Lill.
Once you have
your formal wear on, Lill,
come over here,
put this belt on.
 Whoo!
 PROBST: Hang tight.
I'll put this on you.
(yelps)
You all right?
Those legs going?
 Yep.
 PROBST: Want to take a seat?
 No. I'm fine.
 PROBST: First immunity,
it's the last immunity,
definitely the most
important immunity.
You have this afternoon
to think about
whether it's going
to be Jon or Sandra
that you're taking with you
to the final two.
The most important decision
you'll make in this game.
 Thank you, sir.
 PROBST: Well-earned.
See you guys at Tribal Council.
 That was so tough.
That was one of the hardest
things I think I've ever done.
I was so nervous, I felt like
I was going to throw up.
I knew if somebody else won it,
I would be out of the game.
I didn't think I had a chance.
Welcome home, baby,
welcome home.
Oh, baby, oh.
This was nothing to do
with bargains,
nothing to do with...
scheming, strategy.
This was for Lill,
and Lill only.
And I wanted it for her.
Come on.
Come on.
 Just remember, I have a
husband and kids, too,
I would like to provide for.
 We're not even going
to discuss it, okay?
 If she were smart, she'd keep
Jon and vote me out tonight.
I will be in damn shock
if I'm not voted out tonight.
 That immunity challenge was,
uh...
about the most hardcore thing
I've ever done.
I really didn't have feeling
left in my legs
when I got out of the boat.
And I'm just trying to get
everything moving again.
My gut right now
says I'm going home tonight.
I'm not going down
without a fight.
Sandra thinks, uh,
that she's going.
So... it's all in Lill's hands.
 You could easily
have voted me out yesterday,
right along with Darrah.
 You looked me in the eyes,
and you said,
"Darrah," and I said,
"Lill, whatever you want."
You looked me in the eyes
the day before,
then you said, "Burton." I said,
"Lill, whatever you want."
Lill, will you take me with you?
Say, "Sandra, whatever you
want."
 I have a choice.
Sandra, she's got a family,
She's got children,
she's got a husband, she works.
But, then again, Sandra has
a few people on that jury
that like her.
She may have a good shot at it.
 Mind if I say something
before Tribal Council?
 Sure.
 No one dislikes you, Lill.
Everyone hates me.
 Burton doesn't.
 I got one vote, Lill.
Can you live with a 6-1 victory?
I mean, do you...
You won't get a 6-1
against Sandra.
 What's that mean?
 She's got Christa, she's
got Rupert, she's got Ryno.
 You got a point.
I'm thinking
on two different areas
as far as selecting the right
person to go with me tonight.
First of all, Jon keeps telling
me how much everybody hates him.
He has lied to everybody,
and he has screwed them over
more than one or two times.
And he may be right.
I may be able
to win hands down
because he is so hated.
But then, on the other hand,
I may not,
because he is good at this.
♪ Amazing grace ♪
♪ How sweet the sound ♪
♪ That saved a wretch ♪
♪ Like me ♪
♪ I once was lost ♪
♪ Now I'm found ♪
♪ Was blind, but now I see. ♪
 PROBST: We'll now
♪ Was blind, but now I see. ♪
 PROBST: We'll now
bring in the members
of our jury.
Ryno, Rupert,
T, Christa,
Burton and Darrah,
voted out at last
night's Tribal Council.
Well, for the second
day in a row, you started out
with a very early morning--
sunrise.
Took most of the torches
from the former
tribe members, people
no longer in this
game, and you had
a tribute to them.
Jon, was there anybody
that stood out
for you, that when
you put their torch in, you had
either a strong feeling,
good or bad?
 Yeah, there were two
that really jumped out at me.
Uh, Burton, because, uh...
I really
didn't come into this game
looking to, uh...
to leave with, uh, just a...
a-a really awesome friend,
and I, uh... I did with him.
And, uh, Rupert, uh, in that,
uh, Rupert's one of the nicest
guys I've ever met
and a great guy, but, uh,
the strongest competitor,
and, uh, the most obvious choice
to win a seven-oh jury
this game's ever seen.
So, those two just really
jumped out, and they were, uh,
kind of tough for me.
 PROBST: After you paid
tribute, you had an immunity
challenge, one
that all three of you
wanted desperately.
Sandra, you were first out.
What did you feel
when you knew you were out
and no longer
in contention for immunity?
 In shock.
And then I figured, "Well,
Lill will be out in no time."
But for Lill to just be there
like it doesn't even hurt,
like she's not even in pain, and
Jon is shaking
all over the place.
And I was, like,
"What in the hell is going on?"
Because everyone always thought,
if there's anyone you'd want to
go to in a challenge like that,
it would be up against Lill,
because she'd be no competition.
Who would have thought?
Look what's she's wearing.
 I didn't...
I didn't think it.
 PROBST: Lill,
this is really the last chance
you'll have to control your
fate.
After tonight, all power shifts
to the jury.
You're wearing immunity,
basically choosing
who you want to sit next to
in this vote.
 Mm-hmm.
 PROBST: I just want to run
through some of the attributes
you might consider in making
that decision.
 I thought about the strategy
that this young man
constantly comes up with.
His mind is always going.
He's always got a way out
of everything.
Then, we got Sandra here.
She's got several
friends on the jury
that truly claim her
as a little sister.
And that's also scary.
 PROBST: So, as you sit here
tonight wearing immunity,
having one vote to cast
for one of these
two people, what does it
finally come down to?
 For me, it's gonna come down
to whether or not...
I can possibly beat
that other person
in the final vote.
 PROBST: All right, here's how
tonight's vote will work.
Jon can't vote for Lill.
He can only vote for Sandra.
Sandra can't vote for Lill.
She can only vote for Jon.
Your votes cancel
each other out.
So, Lill, you will
be the only one that is voting,
and you are voting
the fourteenth person
out of this game.
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: And in doing so,
you're deciding who you're gonna
be sitting next to tomorrow
night at final Tribal Council.
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: With that,
are you ready to make the vote?
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: It is time to vote.
Lill.
I'll go get the vote.
Once the votes are read, the
I'll go get the vote.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted
out will be asked
to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the vote.
Fourteenth person
voted out of the tribe...
Jonny Fairplay.
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Need to bring me
your torch, Jon.
 Well, I was packed
and ready to go, Lill.
 I'm sorry, Jon.
 Oh, my God.
 Peace out.
 PROBST: Jon, the tribe
has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Congratulations.
You have gone as far
as you can go in this game.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: There will be
one final Tribal Council
tomorrow night,
so, you have the rest of
tonight, during the day tomorrow
to think about
what you want to say
to convince your jury
of why they should vote
for you, why you
are most deserving
of the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollar
cash prize.
You can head back to camp.
Enjoy your last night
in the Pearl Islands.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Good night.
 Pretty proud of myself.
I, uh, never gave up,
and, uh...
I, uh...
didn't play fair,
and, uh, didn't plan on it.
Happy that my grandma's at home
and doing just fine.
Can't wait to see her.
In a game
in which the old term, uh,
"to be the man,
you got to beat the man"
comes into play, uh,
I was the last man, so...
Peace out from Jonny Fairplay.
 I really appreciate
this, Lill.
Thank you very much.
 Well, I have no regrets.
 When Jeff came down, I had my
hands on my stuff, Lill.
 Yeah?
 I was... I said,
"I'm going home."
 No.
 No regrets.
 When Sandra and I came back
from the Tribal Council,
and the realization hit us that
we are what they call
the two Sole Survivors.
We made it through.
It was a good feeling
knowing that, um,
I came into the game
not knowing a huge amount
about it, but I'm still here.
How surprised were you?
 Surprised? I...
When I saw you writing
a whole bunch,
I said, "Oh, she's
writing Sandra."
'Cause Jon ain't but J-O-N.
 I picked Sandra because
I'm hoping that strategy-wise,
I have more friends on that jury
than she does.
Um, emotional-wise,
I felt that
I wanted Sandra
to have the money
more than Jon.
He was so manipulative.
 Mm-hmm.
 And he thought he could just
demand whatever he wanted
from me and my votes.
You know, this is
what Jon talks about--
drinking and partying
and women and...
 Yeah.
 You and I, we're a family.
Whatever was best for
our kids, your husband.
I mean, that touches me.
 I thought,
before we even left the camp,
that my fate was sealed,
that I was third in line.
In my head, I already
had it planned.
"Okay, grab the torch,
step in the right place."
'Cause every time somebody's
surprised and in shock,
they're all over the damn place.
 But you and I
have lasted the whole time.
 Yeah.
From the first
night to the last.
 So now, Sandra and I
are just going to chill out
tonight, go to bed,
get up in the morning,
just kind of relax
a little bit, and, um,
pack our stuff up and go
to final Tribal Council.
Plain, simple.
(sighs)
Survivor is not
(sighs)
Survivor is not
for the faint of heart.
It is hard on you.
And you have to be
mentally prepared
and you have to be
physically prepared.
For somebody to stand back
in their living room and judge
any one of these 16 contestants
for the things that they did,
they don't realize,
it is not a camping trip.
My middle-aged body
hurts right now.
I'm just worn out.
I don't have the energy.
I really don't have
much of a spirit left.
And I know I need
to get it together for tonight.
 To this day,
no one has ever put my name
on a piece of parchment.
They write it tonight,
it's to give me the money.
It'll be for a good reason,
not for a bad reason.
And that was one of my goals.
Lill is a good person.
So, I don't know why
she doesn't deserve it
more than I do
or why she does deserve it
more than I do.
I hope I win
a million dollars tonight.
I think I have a good chance.
 Thank you.
 And it matches
with your uniform.
I think that what this
will come down to
is a three to four vote.
It's going to be
something real close.
Lill, you look like a pirate.
A Boy Scout pirate.
 Thank you, Lord.
We're out of here.
 Hey, don't look back.
 We got to look back. Stop.
Stop!
Bye, guys.
It's been fun.
You and me, sister.
You and me.
 That's right.
 Let's go knock them socks
off.
 Tonight's the final Tribal
off.
 Tonight's the final Tribal
Council and we're going to be,
uh, going ahead and voting
for whoever gets
the million dollars.
It's pretty wild.
I mean, it's the end
of our journey.
The most amazing thing
about tonight
and having this kind of power is
I don't feel that good about it.
It's a lot of pressure for
everybody to be able to give
somebody a million dollars.
It's just huge.
It's like, you can
cut through the air
with a knife.
It's just...
it's-it's amazing.
I want to be able to give
somebody the money
that deserves it.
You really need
to think about it.
It's a-it's a huge deal
for one of these two people.
 I think that
the pros to Lill is that, uh,
she's definitely persevered, um,
over the course of the 39 days,
um, I think, where people
definitely doubted her
and her ability
to last this long.
Um, she's also had
some good relationships,
I think, with people.
One of the things that
I actually admired about Sandra
was she was so blatant,
so honest.
Like, wow, she was
able to kind of be up front
and stand her ground
and she's still here.
Whereas, other people did it
and they were a threat
and they were kicked off.
 Everyone in this game
has been deceitful.
Everyone has stabbed people
in the back,
has gone against alliances.
But everyone knows it.
I want Sandra and Lill
to answer questions
100% honestly,
giving honest assessment.
If one of them does that
significantly better
than the other, they will
probably get my vote tonight.
So, I want to see 100% honesty
for the first time in this game.
 Here we are today
with the two most
unlikely people, I think,
that I would have expected
at the beginning of this game
in, uh, the final two.
Both of them were the underdogs
in the very beginning
of this game.
Sandra was the first person
expected to be voted out
of the Drake Tribe.
And Lill, I think, was expected
to be the first person
voted out of the Morgan tribe.
So turns out that the two
people that would have been
gone first have now made it
to the very end.
 Um, this is a good game.
You know, there's good sides
and bad sides.
I'm just so emotional...
I'm just...
getting voted out
that close to the very end.
It's a good thing that I get
to get back and say something
to-to let them know
how I feel about them.
You know, 'cause they
pretty much screwed me over.
So, you know, it's a good thing
that I get to say
something back to them.
(sniffs)
 I would hope
that Lill and Sandra
appreciate where they are.
Win or lose,
they should appreciate
the situation
that they have been given...
and earned.
The significance of tonight
is going to be
life-changing for one person.
A million dollars
is going to be life-changing.
We are going to take one little
housewife, one little mama,
and make their lives,
their husbands' lives
and their kids' lives
different.
 I'm not happy about playing
this game as well as I did
and not being
one of the final two.
I feel that the strongest player
in this game made it as far
as he could make it in this game
and that there are two people
that don't deserve to be there.
Jonny Fairplay is going to have
a fun time
at Tribal Council tonight.
The one thing
I can promise tonight
is that I won't play fair.
 PROBST: Sandra, Lill.
is that I won't play fair.
 PROBST: Sandra, Lill.
We'll now bring in
your final jury:
Ryno, Rupert,
T, Christa, Burton,
Darrah and Jon,
voted out
at the last Tribal Council.
Welcome to
your final Tribal Council.
Game changes tonight.
You are no longer in control.
The power now shifts
to the jury.
Seven people that you had a hand
in voting out of this game
now control your fate entirely.
Your task tonight is
to convince this jury
that you are the most worthy,
the most deserving
of the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollar prize.
Here's how it will work.
Give you a chance to make
an opening statement.
This is your time to convince
your jury that you're worthy.
The jury will then get
an opportunity
to ask you a question.
You'll then get a chance
to make a final rebuttal.
After hearing your responses,
the jury will vote.
The biggest vote in the 39 days
going to happen tonight.
Ready to get started?
 Mm-hmm.
 PROBST: Sandra.
Opening statement to the jury.
 Um, hello.
I feel that I deserve the
million dollars because, um,
I was always a team player
from the get-go.
And my strategy was
always to be that person
that anybody can
come to and say,
"Sandra, we need to
vote this person out
so we can move forward
in-in the game."
And I feel that
I accomplished that,
because I was always
a team player.
I helped out 100%.
I gave 100%.
Everyone could
always count on me
to have their backs
and to just always,
you know, help out with
everything that had to be done.
 PROBST: Lill.
 My strategy
from the very beginning
was to just be Lillian Morris.
Not only did my strategy
consist of trying
to be kind to everyone,
because that's what Lillian is.
Lillian is a kind person.
I worked constantly, you know,
while everybody else was, uh,
you know, maybe snoozing
a little bit.
Um, three different people
told me that,
"Lill, we're going to take you
to the final two with me."
Turns out, all three
of these people
kind of turned their back on me.
They said I was too nice.
They wouldn't go up against me.
I think, basically,
my strategy was
just to come in, work hard,
be friendly, do good by others
and just be Lillian.
And I think, uh, mostly,
that's what I was.
 PROBST: Jury, in a moment,
you're going to have
a chance to address
Sandra and Lill,
ask them a question
that will help you decide
who you think should be
the Sole Survivor.
Give you a second
to think about
what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right, jury,
it is now your opportunity
to either make a comment or ask
a question of Sandra and Lill.
The idea here
is to gain information
to help you make
an important vote.
So don't waste this opportunity.
Ryan, you're up first.
 Hey, guys.
 Hi.
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 You did very well,
beat out the 14 of us.
Um, first of all, Lill,
being out of the game
for ten days
and you were in the game
for only 29 days,
my question is,
do you think it's fair
that I give you
the million dollars
over Sandra, being that
she was in the game
for the total 39 days?
 All right.
 I was out of the game
for eight days.
And that was one of the
biggest, lowest points
of... I hate to say of my life,
but it was a really hard time.
Yeah, maybe I wasn't
on the island with you.
But those eight days
that I was out,
it was no picnic being Outcasts.
 Sandra, to you, you've
always been honest with me.
But my question to you is,
do you think
that you rode coattails
as far as, like, maybe...
was there a person
that you used to,
you know, progress?
 I never rode anyone's
coattails.
Um, when I started in the game
and I felt alone, um,
Rupert was also alone,
and I attached myself with him,
and I attached myself
with Christa,
and we became an alliance.
Um, and Rupert was gone early
on, when it came to the jury.
So when Rupert was gone,
then whose coattails did I ride,
if Rupert was no longer there?
I don't feel I rode
anybody's coattails,
because I'm still standing here.
 Okay.
Satisfied.
Sounds good.
 PROBST: All right.
Thanks, Ryno.
Rupert.
 (sighs)
Congratulations to both of you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you, Rupert.
 I'm impressed
and proud of both of you.
 Thank you.
 You made it to the end.
Um, to you, Lill...
you know, I was that scout, too,
when I was younger.
I know the oath.
I know the creed.
I know how you're supposed
to live as you're a scout.
Saying that you're not
going to live that way
because of this game,
you know, or-or
using this game to-to kind of
turn some of those things
that you pledge off.
I feel that aside from
the first day that we merged,
everything that you said to me
was a lie.
Everything that you said
was sucking me in
so I would believe you,
up until the day that I was...
kicked out of this game,
you were still lying to me.
Was there any time that you were
truthful with me? When?
If there was, tell me anything
that you were truthful with me.
Right now...
 Everything was honest
until Burton came to me
and said,
"We need to get rid of Rupert."
 Lill...
 Yes, sir.
 "Everything was honest"
doesn't tell me anything.
You're blaming Burton for you...
 No, there's lots of things
that I was honest...
 Tell me one.
 When you and I were out in
the water and we were talking.
We talked about
our families, our lives,
our dedication to youth.
That was all honest.
That was all on the up-and-up.
 PROBST: I think that's all
you're going to get, Rupert.
 I think so, too.
 PROBST: Rupert, your question
for Sandra.
 Sandra...
the one question I have for you:
On day 27, when I was
booted out of this game,
did you know that was going on?
I just want to know
about that day.
 Okay. Um, that day, when the
vote came through, um,
I did not know
you were going home.
I was mad at Jon--
I don't know
over what-- so I wrote
his name thinking,
"Well, it doesn't matter,
because everyone else
is going to vote off Darrah.
So, my vote can go towards Jon
and it won't make a difference."
When I got back
with Christa to the tribe,
everything just blew up because
I was cursing, mad,
screaming, hollering,
that, "How could this
have happened to Rupert?"
But I was not aware
that you were going.
But, remember, I
always told you: Jon is a snake.
Something's going down.
This is-this is not right.
And what did you say?
"Drake all the way.
We bleed Drake.
Alliance this, alliance that."
And look what happened.
 I know.
 Sounds good?
 Yes.
 I didn't know.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 PROBST: Thanks, Rupert.
T.
 Hello, ladies.
 Hello.
 And first of all,
congratulations.
I have one important question
that will decipher
who I would like
to have win a million dollars.
My question is,
give me one reason
why the other person
does not deserve to win
a million dollars
and why you do.
And I'll start
with you, Lill, first.
 Forgive me.
 No, you have to say
something bad about me.
Go ahead.
(all laughing)
 Um, I felt that
there was, at times,
Sandra had disrespected
a number of people.
I know a number of times
that she'd called me an
"M.F.-er", and all this stuff.
Um, I felt that
at a lot of times
that she did ride the coattails
of other people--
that she would always say,
"You tell me what to do."
And, at times,
I wanted to, you know, say,
"Well, do you have
a mind of your own,
and can you figure
stuff out yourself?"
That's all I want to state.
I'm not going to keep going.
 No, that's fine. Thank you.
Sandra.
 One good reason:
because Lill is responsible
for every single person
being out that's there.
Every single one of you
got a vote from Lill.
Christa, you didn't
get my vote never.
I never put you out of the game.
Rupert, I never put you
out of the game. Um...
That's just one thing.
Because she is a hard worker,
so the only thing
I can say is that everyone
that's there is there
because of Lill.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Satisfied?
 Yes. Thank you.
 PROBST: Good question.
Christa.
 What's up, people?
All right.
Rock stars.
Um...
Lill, first question for you.
So, you always would say,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry," and...
about everything.
You'd win something,
you'd say, "I'm sorry."
And then two seconds later,
you'd start reciting
your Boy Scout's Oath.
So, you always are hiding
behind this
Boy Scout's Oath of yours.
What's the reason for all of it?
What did you really want to say?
 All right, when did I say
I was sorry to you
for something?
 Uh... "I'm sorry about...
voting Rupert out."
"I'm sorry about...
taking this reward."
I mean, just, sorry all the
time.
 On those two occasions,
I was sincerely sorry.
It took a lot out of me
to vote Rupert out.
But I felt like I had to follow
my alliance on that.
I did not hide behind
the Oath all day long.
It's 16 years of volunteering.
It's something that I...
I had no other clothes.
I was in it.
I was stuck in it.
It was part of me.
 So, because of the clothes
that you happened to be
wearing...
 Because of 16 years
of being in an organization
that I volunteered in,
it was so much a part of me.
The first time
that I lied in this game
was with Rupert.
That was the very first time.
And it made me realize
that if I didn't,
I wouldn't stay in this game
for very long.
 So... I guess that's it?
Sandra, since I spent
a lot of time with you,
I always would have
the opportunity
to hear these crazy ideas
that you would come up with.
And you'd tell me,
"Just go with the plan."
"Just sit there, Christa."
And not a lot of people
really knew
that you would come up
with these crazy plans.
So, I was wondering,
what is your most...
challenging...
plotting and scheming obstacle
to keep yourself alive
in this game?
 The craziest scheme
was the one
when me and Tijuana
snuck behind the bushes
and low-crawled through the
dirt.
It was then official
that she was in an alliance
with Jon and Burton
after she said that
when she left the Morgan Tribe,
she was in an... in an alliance
with the two Morgan females.
 All right.
 PROBST: Satisfied?
 Satisfied.
 PROBST: Thanks, Christa.
Burton, you're up.
 Sandra, Lill,
congratulations.
 Thank you.
 The game of "Survivor"
entails two aspects, in my mind:
the survival aspect--
being out in the wilderness,
self-sufficient
or with your tribe--
and then a strategic aspect.
I want to ask you,
from a survival standpoint
and your survival skills,
on a scale of one to ten--
one being, "If I were dropped
off on an island,
I would die within a day,"
ten being,
"Throw me in any situation,
I could survive,
I'd figure it out"--
where do you think you lie?
I'm looking for your honest
self-assessment.
 You go ahead.
 Okay.
For me, if I would
have been dropped off
in the same island
that we're in today,
I think I would have done
maybe a five,
because of the simple fact
that being in
a tropical island,
I kind of, sort of, knew
what foods and fruits
and things to look for.
Now, when it comes to fire
and stuff like that,
I'm not the greatest.
But I think I would have done
good maybe for the first
couple of days, and then I'd
probably just, I don't know,
starve to death.
Because I wasn't going
to eat the hermit crabs
and... and stuff like that.
Five.
 Good answer, I appreciate
that.
 I think I would give myself a
seven, because I can make fire
with no matches. Um...
I am able to, uh, obtain water.
These are skills, uh,
that I've learned as a Scout.
I was diligent and
constantly making sure
that the Morgan Tribe
had fresh water at all times,
and making sure it's boiled
the full 30 minutes...
 Okay, okay.
Yeah, I think you...
 Okay. Got it?
 I think I got it.
 Thank you.
 Thank you, Lill and Sandra.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Darrah.
The floor is yours.
 Um... my question is
to both of you all.
I just want you to explain to me
how both of you got here,
and just give me
an honest answer,
and whoever gives me the most
honest answer will get my vote.
 To me, the reason
I probably was able
to get to where I am now
is because other people
had other agendas.
They had other fish to fry.
Nobody worried about Sandra
because Sandra was weak.
And, again, I was also the
person that if someone needed
that extra vote, I was there.
As long as it wasn't me,
I was ready to give up whoever.
I was just always there
to take advantage
of the situation,
and let the vote go
in a different direction
than my way.
 I'm satisfied.
 PROBST: Lill.
 I am a... non-threat
because... you know,
I was older, non-athletic.
Yes, I did follow
certain alliances,
and I broke away
from that alliance
and went with the someone else
in order to protect that person.
So, I think I'm here because...
Some of it is following along,
some of it is using my own head
and doing something on my own.
 PROBST: Satisfied?
 Satisfied.
 PROBST: Thanks, Darrah.
Jon.
Most recent voted out.
I'm sure you have something
interesting to say.
 My question is for Jeff.
Can I vote "none of the above"?
(laughs)
Uh...
My question is, uh...
Some people were able
to represent themselves
and other things in this game,
and a real case-in-point
is the two of you.
For Sandra, I think you...
you made an attempt
to represent Puerto Ricans.
How do you feel you did
wearing that...
that dual badge of honor?
 I think I did a good job
out here.
You know what I'm saying?
I didn't do anything
that anybody else didn't do.
If I lied, everyone else lied,
too.
If I backstabbed somebody,
I was backstabbed myself.
So, I just took care of myself.
And that's where I get it from,
maybe because I'm Puerto Rican,
that I know that if I don't
look out for number one,
ain't nobody going
to look out for me.
Keep going, or that's good?
 I'm totally happy with that.
 Okay.
 Lill.
You had the opportunity
to represent yourself
and to represent
the Boy Scouts.
There were several periods
in the game in which you made
a promise to me.
Didn't quite live up
to one of those duties:
truthfulness.
How do you feel that
you've represented the Scouts
and represented that uniform?
 If I had it to do over again,
I would not be wearing
this uniform.
I would not be representing
the Scouts.
This game has nothing to do
with honor, integrity...
it has nothing to do
with what the Scout Oath is
and what the Scouts represent.
You know, I was still
in my little world
of being back home
being the Scout Master.
And then, again,
I had to switch modes
and be the S.O.B. that voted
off Rupert.
I wasn't happy about it,
and, no, I did not represent
the Scouts very well at all.
 PROBST: Thanks, Jon.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Sandra, Lill, you
have weathered the questions and
comments from the jury.
In a moment, I'll give you a
chance to make a final rebuttal.
I suggest you take this time
to think about your last words.
 PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra,
this is your last chance
to get at the core of why
you deserve the million dollars.
So, Sandra,
let's start with you.
 Um, I think I played this
game the way I knew how.
Um, when I came here,
I represented myself
the way that I truly am.
There was no lies or deceptions
about how Sandra is.
I always thought that my mouth
would get me in trouble,
but now that I look at it,
being open
and-and saying things
the way they are
is what, I think, helped me
to get this far.
Um, because whenever anyone
approached me and said,
"Sandra, we need to do this
this way," or whatever,
I openly and frankly
expressed my opinion,
"Yes, I'll help you," or
"Yes, I'll go with you."
Um, I am, actually,
surprised to be sitting here.
But now that I am,
I'm kind of glad.
Um, I think I'm a good person,
regardless if I
cussed you out or not.
That's how I was feeling
at the time.
Um, there's no regrets
about whatever I did,
and I'm glad to be sitting here,
and that's all I can say.
Thank you very much
for your time.
 PROBST: Lill, last chance
to convince the jury
to give you a million dollars.
 If I had this
to do all over again,
the Boy Scout uniform
would have been at home.
It's easy target
for anybody to say, "Boy Scouts:
"dignity, honor. Survivor: liar,
cheater," whatever.
Two things don't come together.
And whatever you guys say
about my honor, my integrity...
it's bull ...
It's that way, here.
It's not that way home.
Now, why you should give it to
me and not give it to Sandra?
I also tried to learn this game,
play this game as best I could.
I also tried to remain
respectful to people,
and I also tried
to form friendships.
Friendships dissolved,
and it hurt me bad, because I
couldn't do anything about it.
You either play the game,
or you get voted out.
So no matter what you guys do,
I did the best I could
with what I had...
and the person that I am.
And, like, this is one night.
Yeah, it's a big reward,
but I'm going back home.
I'm gonna be the Big Lill
to 75 kids that look up to me.
And I'm going to explain to them
that this was a game.
Put the Scout uniform aside.
I wish I had, and I didn't.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra,
thank you for your comments.
Jury, thank you for your
questions and comments.
It is now time,
finally, to get to the vote.
Voting is
a little different tonight.
You are not voting somebody
out of the game.
You are voting for a winner.
You are voting for the person
that you think is most deserving
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars,
so you want
to see your name
on the parchment tonight.
It is time to vote-- Ryno,
you're up.
Sandra...
I am so happy for you.
You deserve it.
From the first day, when we
were blood brother and sister,
I was just thrilled to have
somebody on my side.
I'm glad I can be there
for you now.
I hope you win.
 Sandra, I couldn't understand
if your strategy in the game,
um, began, um,
during the very first day,
or if it was by luck that you
got into the right alliance,
and you decided to be up front,
so, with that
being said, I had to look
at who played the game,
regardless of Tribal Council,
um, to the best
of their ability.
Lill, I think
that you did a phenomenal job.
Um, you came in the Outcasts,
and you came back in the game.
And I think that you started
to play it by using your mind.
So, with that being said,
this vote goes to you, Lill.
 PROBST: For the last time,
this vote goes to you, Lill.
 PROBST: For the last time,
I'll go tally the votes.
I know you'd like me
I'll go tally the votes.
I know you'd like me
to read these right now
and get this over with.
Been out here a damn long time.
Unfortunately, it's going
to have to wait.
I will see you
on the other side.
(applause, cheering )
on the other side.
(applause, cheering )
(cheering intensifies )
Guys.
(cheering intensifies )
Guys.
(applause, cheering continue )
All right.
Let's get to it.
Who'd have ever thought this:
Mrs. As-long-as-it-ain't-me
and Mrs. I'm-too-nice
sitting in the final two?
Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Jury, thanks
for a very good
final Tribal Council.
Let's get to the votes.
Like I said earlier,
you want to see your name
on the parchment tonight.
Tonight, the jury
did not vote somebody out.
They voted for a winner.
Here's what's at stake
for the winner:
bragging rights as winner
of Survivor: Pearl Islands,
a new G.M.C. Envoy S.U.V.
to drive around in,
and a little check
for a million dollars.
There are seven votes
inside here.
It takes four votes to win.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Sandra.
(applause and cheering )
Lill.
(applause and cheering)
One vote Sandra, one vote Lill.
Sandra.
(applause and cheering)
Two votes Sandra, one vote Lill.
(applause and cheering)
Three votes Sandra,
one vote Lill.
The winner
of Survivor: Pearl Islands...
(wild cheering)
Sandra.
Sandra, give me a hug here.
(Sandra crying)
You did it.
(applause, cheering intensify)
(muffled speech)
 PROBST: You did hold your
head up in that final Tribal,
Lill.
 It got crazy.
(Sandra crying)
 Oh, Lill!
 PROBST: Sandra, come on
downstage.
Your family's here.
Go give them a hug.
