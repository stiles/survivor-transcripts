         PROBST: Previously on
Survivor:
 PROBST: Aras and Cirie
covered their tracks...
after duping Shane
by ousting Courtney.
 PROBST: At the reward
challenge...
Terry wins reward!
Trish, come on over, give your
man a hug.








...Terry won a night with his
wife at a private villa...
Who's the second loved one that
is going to join you?
...and chose Shane and his son
to join them.
 HB.
 PROBST: Terry picked Cirie's
husband to spend the night at
the tribe camp.
Who's going to Exile Island?
 Danielle.
 PROBST: All right, Danielle,
Exile Island awaits.








 This is Terry's head right
now.
 PROBST: Danielle fumed on
Exile Island, while at a
stunning villa overlooking the
ocean...
 Oh, God.
 PROBST: ...Terry, Shane and
their loved ones...
 I'll be good to you.
 PROBST: ...enjoyed some
quality time together.
 I love you.
 I love you, too.
 The reward was unbelievable.
 What are you gonna do with
that, drink it?
 Yeah.
 With the dirt and stuff in
it?
 PROBST: Cirie's husband was
completely out of his element at
camp.
(fire pops)
 What the hell...?
 PROBST: And after he said his
good-byes...
 See ya, HB!
 PROBST: ...and Terry and
Shane returned to camp, the
tension between Aras and
Terry...
 In my viewpoint, there is no
choice.
 PROBST: ...began to build.
 You're starting to offend me.
What he's doing is, he's feeding
my fire, and the more he does
it, the more I want to beat him.
 PROBST: Terry's flag moving
up quickly.
At the immunity challenge, it
was another showdown between
Terry and Aras.
Terry's almost there.
Aras fighting back.
Not giving up.
Terry wins immunity for the
fifth straight time.
 She's depressed 'cause she
knows she's next.
 PROBST: Shane and Terry were
convinced that Danielle was next
to go.
 My guess is that it's going
to go down that way, yes.
 PROBST: ...but Cirie, Aras
and Danielle had other plans.
 Everything's the same.
Shane is it.
Shane thinks that me, him and
Aras are going to vote for
Danielle, when in all actuality,
me, Aras and Danielle are going
to vote for Shane.
 PROBST: And at Tribal
Council...
Twelfth person voted out of
Survivor: Exile Island...
...Shane was completely
blindsided and ejected from
the game.
Shane the tribe has spoken.
Four are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
(theme song playing)
(insects chirring)
 Aw, boy.
We get back from Tribal and it's
pitch-black-- you can't see
anything.
Well, I put my torch the best
place I could find to put it.
I did, right there.
I couldn't see.
 I didn't know it had a
specific place.
 I don't slap my kids, Terry.
Thank you.
Well, here comes Captain
America, and he's like, "Well,
who dropped their torch in the
middle of the...?"
I don't even know-- in the
middle of what?
We have like 50 miles of beach.
 You do know I was right
behind you...
 Terry, I can't see.
I wasn't looking for you.
So I don't know where you want
my torch to be.
 Well, God, this just looks
like one of my kids, you know...
 Well, I'm not like one of
your kids.
 You're not.
You're not, and that's why I
expected a little bit more.
Make an attempt...
 I don't care what you expect.
I expect more of you-- you're 46
years old!
 Make an attempt to throw...
 Make an attempt to talk to
people like you want to be
talked to.
 I tell you what.
Then the least you could've said
was, "Hey, I'm sorry I dropped
it..."
 I didn't know you were right
behind me.
I don't have to say that.
What are you talking about?
 Regardless, it was where I
happen to be walking...
 Well, sorry, King Terry,
that this torch was where you
were walking?
 All right, all right, Cirie.
Don't get so upset.
 Don't ruin our night tonight,
Terry. All right?
Don't come into final four
territory and ruin it for
everybody else.
 Oh, Who...?
 Terry, you yelled at Cirie
for putting her stick where she
wanted to put it, as a
35-year-old grown woman, and
then you start an argument...
 It was right in front of me,
where I was walking.
After a few minutes, when we
joined up at the fire, I became
the pin cushion and all three
ganged up on me on how
inconsiderate it was for me to
tell Cirie not to drop a piece
of equipment right in front of
me.
 We could've come back here
and celebrated our final four,
but you knocked Cirie right
away-- first thing you do.
 All right, all right.
That's fine, that's fine.
And you know what?
You guys, maybe I'll go to bed
and you can have your little
final-three situation, all
right?
It doesn't matter to me.
 Oh, man.
I didn't come here to make
friends with 24-year-olds.
They haven't made it easy for
me.
The target's been on my back.
I've been the underdog the whole
time.
 Congratulations, final four.
 I know.
 The three of us did it.
 You know what?
If nobody talks to me for the
next five days, I could give...
I'm winning the million dollars
and that's all.
 That's all it is.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
The final four.
You guys ready to get to today's
challenge?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: It is for reward.
Here's how it works:
You will be attached to ropes by
one of two carabiners; using the
two carabiners, you'll clip and
unclip from one rope to another
as you navigate your way
around each other along a main
thoroughfare that leads to six
stations-- holes, hermit crabs
rocks, iguanas, shells and fish.
Each time you get to a station,
you must count the number of
items, race back to the start,
find the answer tile with that
same number on it.
Once you've been to all six
stations, you will have six
numbers.
You'll then place those six
numbers into an answer grid.
Using the combinations of the
two numbers in each column will
open the locks.
If a lock doesn't open, it means
you counted wrong.
You can head back out and
correct your mistakes.
Once you've opened all three
locks, the tribe flag will drop.
First person to lower their
tribe flag, wins reward.
What to know what you're playing
for?
 Yeah.
The winner of today's challenge
gets a once-in-a-lifetime tour
of the Panama Canal aboard a
luxury hundred-foot yacht.
 Huh?
 Wow.
 PROBST: Five-course meal,
open bar.
Spend the night.
In addition, the winner will
decide who goes to Exile Island.
Worth playing for?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots
and we'll get started.
For reward, survivors ready?
Go!
Terry and Aras, off to a quick
start.
You only need one carabiner on
at a time.
Cirie, trying to go around
Terry, booth losing a lot of
time.
Cirie, playing
defensively, nice move.
Aras, off to his first station.
He's counting rocks.
Danielle, counting the shells.
Cirie, to her first station.
She's counting iguanas.
 Ooh. One, two, three...
 PROBST: Terry, counting the
poles.
 ...38.
 PROBST: Aras, heading back
from his first station.
Cirie, right behind.
Now Terry's coming back.
Danielle, heading back from her
first station.
Bit of a traffic jam.
Terry and Danielle, heading
back.
Aras and Danielle, jammed up.
Aras is already coming back
from his second station.
 One, two, three...
 ...18, 19...
 PROBST: Terry, coming back
from the second station.
Cirie, heading back from the
second station.
Terry's made up a lot of time.
Danielle's trapped.
Got everybody locked up.
Now Cirie's making up time.
Cirie, Terry, and Aras, all
back with their second number.
 Doesn't work...
I hate this.
 PROBST: Everybody gonna have
to keep moving.
You slow down, you will fall out
of this.
You get tired, you will fall out
of this.
You can sleep on the yacht.
Aras, getting a lot of momentum
now.
Terry, back out on the course,
looking for his fourth number.
Terry and Aras, mixing it up.
It's back and fourth.
One carabiner over another.
Aras frees up, heads back with
his fourth number.
Danielle, back with her third
number.
Terry, back with his fourth
number.
Cirie, back with her fourth
number.
Aras, heading back with his
fifth number.
Terry, heading back with his
fifth number.
Terry's made up some time.
Terry now with the lead.
Aras takes it back.
Now Terry has it, and Cirie,
coming down to be a roadblock.
 Over the top, Cirie, over the
top.
Danielle's got her fourth
number.
 PROBST: Terry and Aras,
quickly trying to find
their number and get back out
here to that sixth station.
Aras jumps into the lead.
 D, let me through!
Let me through!
 PROBST: Aras, working with
Danielle to get more of a lead.
Terry, right behind him.
Aras, getting blocked by
Danielle.
Aras wants Danielle to block
Terry.
 Go the other way.
 PROBST: Terry and Aras,
looking for their sixth
station.
Danielle, 'causing a roadblock.
It's Aras, Terry, Danielle,
Cirie-- all mixed in together.
Who's working against who?
Who's helping who?
 Ow! Ow!
 PROBST: Cirie blocks Terry
now.
 PROBST: Terry, Aras going to
their last stations.
Aras and Terry neck and neck.
Both coming back from their
sixth stations.
 Block his ass.
 Watch it, Dee.
 PROBST: It is a roadblock
with Terry and Aras trying to
get back to the end.
 Yeah, man. Whoa!
 You pushed me first, Aras.
You pushed me first.
 PROBST: Whoa, easy guys,
easy.
 Pull.
 Terry, you pull it.
 Keep your hands off.
 PROBST: Two battering rams.
 Oh, my...
 PROBST: Aras now tied up with
Cirie.
Terry now with a bit of a lead.
 Oh, oh, my rope...
 PROBST: Terry first back to
his box.
 Dee, go around me!
 PROBST: Aras back now.
It's Terry and Aras.
Do they have the right six
numbers?
Both trying to solve the
combinations.
Three locks.
 Six, seven, eight.
 PROBST: Cirie and Danielle,
you're not out of it till they
get their locks open.
Aras has figured out his first
lock.
Cirie back with her sixth
number.
Danielle now back.
She's in it.
Suddenly, Cirie and Danielle
have a shot.
Terry's figured out his first
lock.
Cirie has her first lock undone.
Danielle has her first lock
open.
Everybody working on their
second locks.
Everybody in this.
Anybody could win it.
You think you have a number
wrong, go back.
Cirie and Terry heading back out
for a second look.
 Go back there.
 PROBST: Aras going to head
back out.
Danielle all alone now.
If she's right, she could win
it.
 Three...
 PROBST: Terry coming back.
Thinks he has the answer now.
Danielle heading back out on the
course for a second look.
Seems nobody thinks they got it
right.
Terry's still fighting it, still
not getting it.
Cirie and Aras have been gone a
long time.
Terry heading back out for a
third look.
 Don't you have to come back
after each look once you're out
there?
Aras should have been back here
already.
He's taking multiple looks.
 PROBST: No, Terry, you're
good.
 I can take multiple looks?
 PROBST: Yes!
 Oh, you didn't tell us that.
Was one look and back to the
station.
 Somebody call an ambulance.
Terry's crying on the course.
 Well, I had to take over your
role.
 PROBST: Aras is back.
Did he get it right this time?
Danielle, Cirie, Terry, you are
still in it.
Aras opens his second lock.
Aras with one lock left.
Aras has his third lock undone!
Aras wins reward!
 Yes!
 Good on you.
Good on you.
You-you got whatever he said,
and I missed it.
Let me get this straight.
The first time out, we were only
allowed one pass, come back and
get the numbers.
 PROBST: Yes.
 Well, the second time I
came back, you know, I didn't...
I didn't have to come back.
I could have got... stayed out
there.
 I got a question, Terry.
Every time somebody else wins,
are you going to say you got
hosed?
It that how it's going to be?
 Uh, that's the only... first
time I lost, so there you go,
Aras.
 Are you serious?
 Right back at you.
 'Cause every time you don't
win something, you complain
about it, every time.
 Right back at you...
 You have no respect for
anybody else out here.
 Keep it up.
 What are you going to do?
Say something bad about women?
Do I have to worry about that?
 Oh, there you go.
That always works.
That's a real mature comeback.
(Aras scoffs)
(Terry sighs)
 PROBST: Aras?
 Yo.
 PROBST: Come on over.
Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Okay.
Tour the Panama Canal.
Hundred-foot luxury yacht,
five-course meal, open bar and
an overnight stay.
You're bringing one person with
you.
The other two people who do not
go on the reward will go to
Exile Island.
(Cirie gasps)
So the name I want is the person
who is going with you on the
reward.
 Cirie.
 PROBST: Cirie.
 Thank you!
 Sorry, Dee.
Sorry, Terry.
 Got to do what you got to do,
man.
 PROBST: Danielle, heading
right back to Exile Island.
Terry, been there several times
yourself.
Grab your stuff.
Boat's waiting.
(engine humming)
 Cirie, we're going on a
yacht, and then we're going to
go see the Panama Canal, but,
most importantly, we're going to
eat.
(Cirie laughs)
 Winning my first individual
reward challenge was really big
for me psychologically.
The reward was a five-course
dinner on a yacht through the
Panama Canal.
(boat horn toots)
(man speaking Spanish)
 Gracias.
 Okay.
 I was totally excited about
being picked.
I've seen yachts on TV, in music
videos...
(Cirie giggles)
...but never in my wildest
dreams would I have ever thought
I myself would be on a yacht.
 Cirie, cheers.
 Cheers to you, Aras!
 Final four.
 Final four.
 And hopefully, both of us
make it final three.
 I know. Final two.
Why you joking?
 Yeah, final two.
 Damn, that is huge.
Damn, that's big!
You can fit my house in there.
 If you couldn't fit your
house in there, Cirie, I
wouldn't let you win the
million dollars.
Let me tell you that right now.
The situation with Terry is, I
see him whining, and I'm, like,
"Oh, Terry's whining," and I
make fun of him.
 What was he saying at that
time?
What he say...?
 "Jeff, Aras should be back by
now."
(Cirie laughing)
"Aras should be back!
He's looking at two in one
trip."
 Is that what he said?
 Yeah.
(Cirie laughs)
And I yelled out, "Somebody call
an ambulance.
Terry's crying on the course."
It was huge to beat Terry at the
reward challenge, but for me,
what I try to practice is love
and-and compassion, and I
haven't practiced love and
compassion with Terry recently.
I have been...
It's been ego.
It's been all of my ego.
 Oh, this game is terrible.
 It is.
You got to take people out.
 I hated that challenge today.
(Terry scoffs)
 You know what?
The rivalry with Aras is
starting to get a little
unhealthy.
The past couple days, he's
getting really, really
emotional.
 Yeah.
 And I don't know if it's...
he's cracking or what.
Aras is kind of a hothead these
days.
His emotions-- he's really
wearing them on his sleeve.
What ticked me off is, at the
challenge, I was just trying to
get a final ruling on how I
basically messed up.
And out of his mouth came, "You
always argue when you've lost."
Then he said "Well, you know,
what are you going to do, uh,
you know, make a disparaging
remark about women?"
I have not made a disparaging
remark against a woman here.
I wasn't appreciative of that,
but, uh, I've got to just act
like a 46-year-old, try to calm
it down, you know, and
hopefully, you know, there will
be one more immunity challenge,
either myself or Danielle will
win it, and he'll be gone.
 Say you win the next
immunity.
 That-that would... would be a
must if we... if us two want to
get to the final three, and...
 Then, yeah, you would win,
and then Aras and Cirie will
probably vote me, and since...
 Right.
You'll have the hidden immunity
idol.
 I'll have the hidden idol,
because you won't be able to use
it after that anyway.
 Right, right, and then
just...
 And then I can vote Aras off,
and then Aras will be the one to
go.
That would be...
 Right. Right, unless Cirie's
got some wild hair and wants to
vote Aras off, too.
 I doubt it.
 Yeah.
 They have, like, a bond.
 Yeah.
 Aras ended up winning the
reward challenge, and he got to
pick one person to take with
him.
He chose Cirie, so, therefore,
that tells me that it's the
right time to align myself with
Terry.
It's gotten to the point where
it's like I'm going to try to
use him.
I don't care about being his
friend.
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to win the million
dollars.
I can't believe you found that
right away.
 Terry has the hidden immunity
idol.
I mean, before she showed me a
little glimpse of it, but this
time around, I held it in my
hands.
It's 100%, and I know he is
going to possibly let me use it.
 We are going to do this
thing, and we're both going to
shake and look each other in
the eye, and...
 No, no, I'll be...
I-I will swear on it now.
 We are going to go to the
finals, you and I.
No matter who wins the three,
you and I will go to the finals,
and that's the way we'll do it.
Then...
 We can't let Aras win the
next immunity.
 No, uh-uh, no, we can't...
 He cannot win.
 The Panama Canal connects
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
and most of the canal is like a
river, and then you get to the
locks, and the locks are what
allow you to rise or lower,
depending on where you are in
the canal, which is really cool.
(bell ringing)
 Wow.
(horn honks)
 The canal-- it just was
unbelievable that something man-
made could actually do something
like that.
 It's cool, huh?
(Cirie chuckles)
 Right now, I'm closer to Aras
than anyone out here.
I have been for 34 days now.
 This is my favorite time of
day right here.
(seagulls screeching)
 We're just taking it all in
and thinking how nice it would
be if the two of us made it to
the final two.
(horn blowing)
 Here's to the final four.
(Aras mutters)
Hopefully, the final two.
 On the yacht, from a
distance, this looks like a nice
place.
I'm like, "Wow, is that our
beach?
Damn, it looks nice.
"Is that where I spent the last
35 miserable days of my life?"
(chuckling)
But you know what?
Even though I'm not the
adventurous, outdoors type,
it was kind of nice to come
back.
 Oh, that was amazing.
 That was amazing.
(breaking wind)
 Oh!
 That's why I don't like you.
 Come on, come back here,
Cirie.
 No, it's toxic.
(breaking wind)
 I'm sorry, it's that
reward.
(groans)
 Hmm...
I have never started a fire by
myself with the flint.
I wouldn't mind trying it.
I don't think it's strange that
I haven't started a fire by
myself because there's always
people around jumping at the
bit to start the fire, so why
stop them?
If you want to start the fire,
go ahead.
Aras would never expect me to
have a fire going when he woke
up, so that's why I'm trying
to get it going before he wakes
up.
I got a fire!
Damn!
(laughs)
Oh, yeah.
(laughs)
I used the flint.
 Wow.
I'm impressed.
Cirie made a fire.
It's awesome.
Day one, Cirie out here would
not have known what to do, and
now she's come full circle.
 Yeah, I got the fire.
(laughs)
 PROBST: Come on in guys.
Hello.
 Hey, Jeff.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
Terry and Danielle from Exile
Island.
Welcome back, guys.
 Thanks.
Hey.
 PROBST: Aras, how was the
tour of the Panama Canal?
Did you get some food in your
belly.
 I got a lot of food in my
belly, Jeff.
I ate almost too much.
 PROBST: Feel energized for
today's challenge?
 Yeah, I feel great.
 PROBST: Ready to get to
today's challenge?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: First thing's first.
After five straight individual
immunity wins by Terry, once
again immunity is back up for
grabs.
For today's challenge, you will
work to solve three puzzles.
Here's how it works.
Using a set of coordinates,
you'll cross two ropes.
Where the ropes intersect
you'll find a bag of puzzle
pieces.
Race back to your answer board,
solve the puzzle.
That puzzle will give you your
next set of coordinates leading
you to another bag of puzzle
pieces and more coordinates.
Make sense?
First person to complete all
three puzzles wins immunity,
guaranteed a spot in the final
three.
Your first set of coordinates
have already been set up for
you.
We'll draw for positions and
we'll get started.
Here we go.
For immunity, survivors ready?
Go.
First coordinates are already
done for you.
Everybody's digging.
Aras found his first bag of
puzzle pieces.
Danielle, Cirie, Terry all have
their pieces.
Everybody working on their
first bag of puzzle pieces.

 PROBST: Danielle has it.
She's heading out.
 Scarecrow to mountain.
Sword to candle.
 PROBST: Aras has his second
bag.
He's heading back.
Terry and Danielle are going to
have to make up some time.

it.

second puzzle.

second bag of pieces.
He's got some time to make up.

 Skull, fire, dagger, skull.
Skull, fire, dagger, skull.
 PROBST: Danielle having
trouble.
 I don't get it.
 PROBST: Use those ropes.
You're getting sloppy with the
ropes, you're not going to find
it.
 Dagger, skull.
 PROBST: Terry taking his
time, making sure he's right.
 Skull, fire, dagger, skull.
 PROBST: Aras making good
progress on that last puzzle.
Terry has his third bag of
puzzle pieces.
He's racing back now.
It's Terry and Aras.
Immunity on the line.
Terry has his bag open.
Starting to work on the puzzle.
Aras still with a bit of a lead.
Danielle back with her second
bag.
 Damn!
 PROBST: It's down to Aras and
Terry.
Both guys taking their time,
nobody panicking.
Terry getting through his
puzzle quickly.
He's gaining on Aras.
We are tight.
Aras very close.
Terry getting closer.
Aras working on that last piece.
 "Safe from the vote."
Got it!
 PROBST: Aras wins immunity!
 All right.
 Damn.
 PROBST: First time somebody
other than Terry is wearing
individual immunity.
Aras is safe from the vote
tonight.
Terry, Danielle, Cirie, after
36 days, this game will come to
an end for one of you at Tribal.
It should make for a very fun
afternoon.
Head on back to camp.
See you at Tribal.
 Um, the comments you made
yesterday after the thing, um,
were undefendable by me out in
front of everybody like that.
They were false, uncalled for
and really slanderous.
What I need for from you is
either an apology, and then we
can talk about where you're
coming from and where I'm
coming from, or we don't have a
relationship for the next three
days because that's how serious
stuff like that can be.
I don't treat flight attendants
like that, I haven't done
anything that I wouldn't tell
my wife, my friends, my family,
my priest.
 Terry was really upset that
I made a comment to him after
the reward challenge about him
talking bad about women.
Um, and you know what?
I didn't feel good about making
the comment that I made.
When I made that comment, I
knew it was going to get to
you, but I apologize and I
crossed a line that I don't want
to cross.
 Okay.
 I apologize a hundred
percent.
You have not said a mean thing
about women.
That was out of context and I
should not have said that.
As a human being, I treated you
unfairly and I take full
responsibility for that.
Going through this experience
is something that really brings
you closer together, regardless
of how you feel about someone's
personality.
And hopefully Terry and I,
through our conflict, we help
each other grow.
I apologize for going personal
like that on you.
 All right, well, then, right
here.
 I'm sorry.
Straight up.
I thought about that and I don't
want to make this a personal
thing.
 I accept that. I accept that.
 I don't want to make it...
 What the hell are they
talking about?
 Why they hate each other.
 The outcome of the immunity
challenge today-- Aras won, and
now, uh, Tribal Council is going
to go a little bit differently
than we planned.
Do you guys know what you're
voting?
Aras has the immunity necklace,
and Terry has the hidden
immunity idol, and my guess is
that Aras and Cirie are probably
going to vote me, and then me
and Terry would vote Cirie.
So it looks like me and you are
going for... up against
something tonight.
 Probably fire.
That's what it usually is,
making fire.
 So, we're assuming there will
probably have to be a
tiebreaker.
We'll probably have to do some
sort of fire challenge, um,
we're, we're guessing.
I'm telling you right now,
they're gonna...
It's going to be a two-two for
me and Cirie.
 Well, I was just wondering if
you needed to... you know, learn
how to... know how to deal with
the magnesium.
That's what they're going to ask
you for.
 With the flint, you mean?
Yeah, the back of the flint.
 You know the technique,
right?
(Aras vocalizing whooshing)
 Yeah, I know how to do it.
 Blow on it, like... and then
sticks... small sticks.
 I got that part.
 Small sticks first, then put
more husk.
 Just take the flint.
(Terry vocalizing whooshing)
 Yeah.
 Take that back side, and you
go...
(Terry vocalizing whooshing)
...and you get as many...
Try to get a pile about the size
of a quarter next to your
teepee, all right, so the tinder
will catch.
 ...with sticks.
 So as soon as I get a flame,
should I blow it or no?
 Hell, yeah.
 Or let it catch first?
 Yeah, let it catch and
then...
(blowing)
...and then keep building.
Just keep putting sticks up.
Hey, and have fun when you do
it, too.
Don't worry about the results.
You made it so far already.
Just enjoy yourself and know
that you can do it.
 I have to.
I don't want to go home.
I have, like, mixed emotions
about Tribal tonight.
I feel nervous, and I feel like
I'll prob...
You know, it's a really strong
possibility that I'm going to
go home, but at the same time,
I think I'll do fine in the
fire-making challenge.
I've only seen Danielle make
fire with flint herself one
time, and I think I'm just as
good as she is at it.
I want her to think she has the
upper hand.
 I'm pretty confident that I'm
good at starting fires, and I
haven't seen Cirie do that at
all, so I don't think the fire
is her thing, but then again, I
mean, I'm confident, but you
never know, so you have to be
prepared.
You always have to have backup
options.
 Right. Right.
 Then there's a tie, and we
go.
 If you had the idol on you,
then Cirie would automatically
be out...
 Be out.
 ...and then you and me
and-and Aras would go.
 This hidden immunity idol--
tonight's the last night it can
be used, so I'm going to work
Terry.
If you gave it to me, they voted
for me, and it was two for me
and two for Cirie, and I pulled
out the idol, I'd be fine?
 Yeah. Yeah, you'd be fine.
 I'm going to work him until
we go to Tribal Council to-to
try to give me that hidden
immunity idol, and, uh, we'll
see what happens.
 PROBST: I'll now bring in the
members of our jury.
Austin, Sally, Bruce, Courtney
and Shane voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
Well, when we started this game,
we started with four groups--
older men, older women, younger
men, younger women.
You got to be proud going to the
final four with one person
representing each group.
So, Aras, you and Terry have
been battling at challenges.
Suddenly, Terry loses
back-to-back, you win
back-to-back.
Has there been a momentum shift?
 Yeah, I think there's been a
momentum shift.
This is the way that I look at
it.
I know every single time you
say, "Survivors ready," I have a
chance to win, so I always had
faith that if I kept knocking on
the door, eventually, it would
open up.
 PROBST: Terry, this is the
first time you've been in Tribal
Council without that necklace.
You are, in a sense, vulnerable.
Do you feel it?
 No.
 PROBST: You don't feel
vulnerable?
 Right.
 PROBST: Cirie, seem odd to
you that Terry is not the least
bit concerned?
 No.
We've suspected for the longest
time that Terry could possibly
have the hidden immunity idol,
and that would be the only
reason that Terry should feel
safe tonight, so I guess we were
right.
 PROBST: Let's talk about this
hidden immunity idol.
I told you that it was good
through the final four vote.
We are at the final four vote.
It has not come into play yet.
Tonight is the last night.
Did that topic come up at all?
 Obviously, that topic came
up, but it's up to the person
that has it, and we don't know
if they a hundred percent have
it.
 PROBST: The "they" is Terry?
 We're assuming Terry has it.
Obviously, if he uses it, he'll
use it on himself.
 In my opinion, I'm 100% sure
that Terry had that hidden
immunity idol.
Now, whether or not it's still
in his pocket or it's in
somebody else's pocket-- that we
don't know, but it's a risky
call if you have that hidden
immunity idol and give it to
somebody else and put yourself
on that chopping block, so we'll
see what happens.
 PROBST: So either way, Terry,
it seems like good news for you
at this point, because people
aren't sure if you have it or
not.
 I'm not sure if I have it or
not.
 PROBST: Well, here's what we
know.
If there's a hidden immunity
idol, it will come into play
after the vote.
So, going into the vote, the
only person you can't vote for
is Aras.
Cirie, if this is your last
night-- you've been out here 36
nights-- how have you changed?
 I have lived my life
underestimating myself.
I've been on a couch for 35
years, basically.
And to see the things that I've
done and how long I lasted here,
if this is my last night, I had
a great time, I've experienced
things I could never experience,
once in a lifetime, and I'm
okay.
 PROBST: Danielle, how about
for you?
Have you changed out here, 36
days in?
 I just think that I've grown
to be more patient with
different personalities.
I mean, I don't think I've done
this crazy change, but I've...
I think I've mentally grown
stronger, and just like Cirie, I
was not an outdoorsy type of
girl, and I can scale a fish
now, I'm great with fire now.
It's just come natural now to
me.
Like, if you want to do
something, get up and do it and
make it happen, 'cause it's...
It can happen.
It's easy.
 PROBST: Terry, since nobody
seems to know for sure whether
you have the idol or not, it
could be you tonight.
 Uh, if it is, I've proved to
myself that I-I could still hang
it out there with the... with
the best of the competition, and
the other thing I've realized
that I'm human, and I'm going to
make mistakes.
But damn it, I'm going to learn
from them, and I'm going to be
more patient with my kids, my
wife and-and friends and family,
and, uh, I'm going to take that
to heart and take it back home
with me, try to practice that.
 PROBST: Okay.
Let's get to the vote.
Aras, you have immunity.
Keeping it?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Aras is the only
person you cannot vote for,
hidden immunity idol or not.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.
Danielle, you're up.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Danielle.
Cirie.
One vote Danielle, one vote
Cirie.
Danielle.
Two votes Danielle, one vote
Cirie.
One vote left.
Cirie.
We have a tie.
Cirie with two votes, Danielle
with two votes.
Danielle, Cirie, if either of
you have the hidden immunity
idol, now is the time to play
it.
Neither of you have it?
The idol will not come into play
in this game.
It no longer has any power, and
we have a tie.
Aras, Terry, you are safe.
Danielle, Cirie, you're going
to take part in a tiebreaker
challenge.
Here's how it will work.
It is a fire-making challenge.
You've been out here 37 days.
Making fire should be something
you know how to do.
You will have a fire-starter kit
and a small fire pit.
Your job is to a build fire tall
enough to burn through a rope,
raise the flag.
First person to raise their
flag stays in this game, moves
onto day 37.
Loser is out of the game and
becomes the sixth member of our
jury.
All right, Danielle, take a
spot.
Cirie, spot next to her.
You each have in your kit a
magnesium flint, you have a
knife, and you have all sorts
of kindling and other ways to
start a fire-- coconut husks,
things like that.
(Cirie exhales)
On my go, you will begin.
Here we go.
Survivors ready?
(Cirie exhales loudly)
Begin.
