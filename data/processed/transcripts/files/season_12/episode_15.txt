         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 16
Americans set foot on a
small remote island off the
coast of Panama...
Welcome to Survivor.
In a new social experiment, they
were split into four tribes:
the younger men, the younger
women, the older men and the
older women.
And in a new twist, this








isolated isle would become a
looming force in the strategy of
the game.
This is Exile Island.
Throughout this game, tribe
members will be banished to this
island. Go!
In the first challenge, the
young women finish last and
chose Misty to stay behind on
Exile Island...
 I'm here.
 PROBST: ...and a secret was
revealed.








Hidden on this island is an
immunity idol.
Along the way, you'll be given
clues as to the whereabouts
of that idol.
 Okay, here we go kids.
 PROBST: The two older tribes
fared well.
 That's the best stinking fire
I've seen in a long time.
 PROBST: The two younger
tribes floundered.
 That's a shelter right there,
gentleman.
 That is the sorriest shelter
I think we could have possibly
come up with.
 PROBST: Misty failed to find
the hidden idol on Exile Island
and rejoined her tribe...
Young women doing a good job.
...to play for immunity.
(cheering)
Older women going to Tribal
Council!
Cirie immediately undertook a
bold plan to get the most
productive of the older women
ousted.
 I'm gonna try to get rid of
the lumberjack lady.
First person voted out of
Survivor: Exile Island...
The plan worked and Tina was the
first to be voted out.
The tribe has spoken.
From the beginning, the
experience of survival took its
toll.
 I smoked three packs of
cigarettes a day for 20 years,
and I haven't had a cigarette
in, like, 31 hours.
I don't know why I did this to
myself.
 Green sweats.
 PROBST: In a schoolyard
pick...
 Cool guy.
...that brought new hope.
 The cool guy.
 PROBST: ...the four tribes
became two: La Mina and Casaya.
 Terry makes an unbelievable
catch!
La Mina enjoyed an early winning
streak.
La Mina wins immunity!
Casaya, Tribal Council tonight.
It's gonna cost you a member.
Before Casaya went to Tribal
Council, Shane wanted to quit.
 I'm gonna quit.
I have to quit.
 PROBST: But Aras managed to
change his mind.
 Just try it, okay?
 All right.
 PROBST: With Shane back in
the fold...
 You guys, now we have to talk
about who we're gonna vote off.
I just want to do this with
honesty and, like, openness.
 PROBST: ...it became clear
that Melinda and Cirie were
doomed.
 I don't care which one of you
goes.
Like, whoever doesn't go now is
going next.
 PROBST: Melinda went first...
Melinda, the tribe has spoken.
...and Cirie's situation seemed
hopeless.
 I'm walking on egg shells as
it is.
I was told I'd be the next to
go. You were right.
 PROBST: But her social skills
and patience would take her far
as she sat back and watched
Casaya fall apart.
 Why are you so sensitive?!
 PROBST: Shane was usually the
catalyst for drama at Casaya.
 Everybody here won't tell you
because they're afraid to tell
you the truth!
I want one! This one!
I just want mine!
 It's just constant, constant
drama.
I love it, love it, love it,
yes!
 Right there!
 PROBST: But the dysfunctional
Casaya enjoyed an impressive
five-challenge winning streak.
Casaya wins immunity!
And La Mina lost Misty and Ruth
Marie.
Casaya sent Terry to Exile
Island, and he quickly turned
banishment into a position of
power.
 "This talisman can
be used to keep you safe from
the vote at Tribal Council."
All right!
 PROBST: His possession of the
idol-- or the suspicion that he
might have it-- would affect the
nature of the game up to the
very end.
Terry, Danielle diving in.
And Terry's luck continued when
La Mina managed to win the next
immunity challenge.
La Mina wins immunity!
Bruce was in serious danger of
being chopped from Casaya, but
Danielle made a power play.
 Courtney, why don't we switch
this game up right now?
I wanted Bruce to stay and I
wanted Bobby to go.
 PROBST: Bruce was saved and
Bobby took the fall.
The tribe has spoken.
 That's it. That's it.
 PROBST: Casaya was able to
make a comeback.
Casaya wins immunity!
And at Tribal Council, Dan was
voted out.
The tribe has spoken.
On day 16, Casaya had the
advantage in numbers; six to La
Mina's four.
 There they are.
 PROBST: And when the Casaya
six saw La Mina approaching for
the merge...
 Hey, come here quickly.
 PROBST: ...they circled up
against them.
 We stay together, we'll get
to the top six.
One, two, three, win.
Come on in.
 PROBST: Terry did his best to
get someone from Casaya to flop.
 You might be on the chopping
block.
Come over and we will go to the
final five.
Our group of four would like to
offer you more time of worry-
free life around here.
 PROBST: But nobody from
Casaya would budge...
 It was almost laughable.
I don't think he's in a position
to offer me anything.
 PROBST: ...so his only option
was individual immunity.
Terry wins the first individual
immunity.
And in an amazing feat, Terry
the fighter pilot continued to
dominate at the individual
challenges.
With Terry perpetually safe from
the vote and with the hidden
immunity idol in his back
pocket, the other former La Mina
tribe mates were picked off one
by one.
Nick.
Austin.
Sally.
Terry was the last La Mina
member standing.
On day 25, a prickly reward
challenge revealed what the
tribe really thought of each
other.
"Who is the most annoying person
out here?"
Everybody says "Courtney."
 God!
 PROBST: But Courtney's
unpopularity made her a popular
candidate for the final two.
 If I need your vote, would
you trust me and not break my
back?
 You know, I want to be on
your back side and I would like
you to be on mine.
 Okay. She is a dream to
take to the final two.
Anyone could win against her.
(groans)
 PROBST: On day 25, Bruce's
internal pain became a medical
emergency.
 Bruce? You allergic to
anything?
(gasps)
 PROBST: He was evacuated and
forced to leave the game.
Terry continued to hang on with
all his might.
(gasps)
Terry wins his fourth straight
immunity.
 I am totally motivated to
kick their butts at everything
that comes down the road.
I'm gonna have to take you to
the bank the whole time.
 If you do that, man, hats'
off.
 PROBST: And he stayed true
to his word.
Terry wins immunity for the
fifth straight time!
The day of reckoning finally
came when the former Casayas
were forced to turn on one of
their own, and Shane targeted
Danielle.
 We're gonna vote off
Danielle.
 But then there's still
Courtney.
It'll be me, you and Courtney.
 Right.
 PROBST: Shane's plan made
Cirie suspicious.
 If he can take Courtney to
the final two, he just may win
a million dollars.
So Courtney's going.
 PROBST: And at Tribal
Council, Cirie's scheme took
Courtney out of the equation.
Courtney, the tribe has spoken.
With the former Casaya bond
finally broken, it became
every man for himself.
Terry and Shane banded together
in another attempt to oust
Danielle.
 She's depressed because she
knows she's next.
 PROBST: And they were
confident they would be
successful.
 I feel like, at this point, I
could beat anybody.
 PROBST: But at Tribal
Council...
The 12th person voted out of
Survivor: Exile Island.
Shane was completely blindsided
by Cirie, Aras and Danielle.
 Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a
chocolate ice cream bar in about
one, I mean, one minute!
 PROBST: Shane, the tribe has
spoken.
...leaving Aras, Danielle, Terry
and Cirie as the final four.
Go!
At the next reward challenge,
the rivalry between Terry and
Aras got physical.
Whoa! Easy, guys!
Two battering rams!
And when Aras won the reward...
Aras wins reward!
 Yes!
 PROBST: ...things got
personal.
 The first time out we we were
only allowed one pass.
 PROBST: Yes.
 Terry, every time somebody
else wins, are you gonna say you
got hosed?
 Keep it up. Just keep it up.
 PROBST: For the reward, Aras
chose Cirie to join him on a
luxury yacht.
 Hopefully both of us making
final three.
 Final two. What, are you
joking?
 Yeah, final two.
 PROBST: Danielle and Terry
were both sent to Exile Island
where they made their own pact
to the final two.
 I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to win the million
dollars.
It's the right time to align
myself with Terry.
 PROBST: At the immunity
challenge...
Go!
...all four fought hard to piece
together a win, but Aras came
away victorious.
Aras wins immunity!
First time somebody other than
Terry is wearing individual
immunity.
With Aras immune and Terry in
possession of the hidden idol,
Danielle and Cirie knew it could
be a tricky Tribal Council.
 Probably Aras and Cirie are
gonna vote me, and then me and
Terry would vote Cirie.
So I think me and you are going
up against something tonight?
 Probably fire.
 You know the technique,
right?
 PROBST: With the possibility
of a tie vote looming, Terry and
Aras coach their allies in
fire-making.
 Just take the flint and
you...
 PROBST: Meanwhile, Danielle
still pushed Terry to give her
his hidden immunity idol.
 If I have two and she has
two, I think it doesn't matter
if you have the idol.
 It's a huge gamble.
 I'm gonna work him until we
go to Tribal Council to try to
give me that hidden immunity
idol.
 PROBST: This was Terry's last
chance to play the hidden
immunity idol...
We have a tie: Cirie with two
votes, Danielle with two votes.
...but he kept it for himself.
Cirie and Danielle prepared for
a trial by fire.
Here we go.
Survivors ready?
Now only four remain: Cirie,
Aras, Danielle and Terry.
Begin.
Tonight, the tiebreaker between
Cirie and Danielle will be
decided, and the final three
will compete in the last
immunity challenge.
Two will go on to face the jury,
one will outlast all the rest
and become the sole Survivor.

 PROBST: Okay, Danielle,
Cirie, you're going to take
part in a tie-breaker challenge.
You each have in your kit, a
magnesium flint, you have a
knife, and you have all sorts
of kindling and other ways to
start a fire-- coconut husks,
things like that.
On my "go," you will begin.
First person to burn through
that rope and raise the flag
stays in this game.
Here we go.
Survivors ready?
Begin.
Both Danielle and Cirie
scraping magnesium.
Both are using coconut husks.
Cirie has a flame.
Can she keep it going?
Danielle not giving up.
Danielle not panicking.
Cirie has a healthy flame all
of a sudden.
Trying to keep it going before
it burns out.
Danielle now has flame, but it
goes out.
You have to build a fire with a
flame high enough to burn
through that rope.
Just putting more coconut husk
on it may not be enough.
Now it's Danielle who has flame.
Danielle has a big flame.
Is it enough to burn through
the rope?
Danielle blowing on it to keep
it going.
Cirie paying attention to
Danielle.
Should be working on her fire.
Danielle's fire is out.
Cirie has flame again.
Can she figure out how to build
it?
Danielle has fire, Cirie has
fire.
Somebody is going to have to
get a fire burning long enough
to burn through that rope.
Cirie's is out again.
Danielle's is still going.
Danielle has a nice little fire
going.
She's protecting it, going to
let it grow, using little
pieces.
Cirie's got to get flame again.
Cirie now has a flame.
Danielle putting a bigger stick
on, getting closer now to the
rope, building a bigger fire.
Cirie nurturing a very small
flame.
Can she figure this out?
 Burn.
 PROBST: Cirie's getting a
bigger flame.
It may not be enough.
Danielle's flame has been
sitting on that rope.
The rope's on fire.
Cirie, you've got to hurry.
Danielle wins the challenge.
Danielle stays in the game.
Cirie becomes the sixth member
of our jury.
 (sniffling)
 PROBST: Cirie, you need to
bring me your torch.
Cirie?
 Yep.
 PROBST: The tribe has spoken.
 All righty.
 PROBST: It's time for you to
go.
 Bye, Cirie.
 PROBST: Well, you have made
it to the final three.
Over the next three days, we
will have two challenges, two
Tribal Councils, one winner.
Grab your torches and head back
to camp.
Good night.
 Well, my time here is up.
I lasted far beyond my highest
expectations.
I hope that my family is proud.
Sorry, guys, I let you down.
I couldn't get the fire going.
But I feel like I can still
hold my head up high.
So I'm extremely proud to be
out on day 36.
 I was determined to not go
home tonight at Tribal Council.
 Whoa!
 I was just so happy that I
got it together and I got my
fire going.
And I won, and I'm ecstatic
right now.
I'm so happy.
 Feed it a little bit of
straw.
I'm going to get more straw.
I've been extremely happy since
Tribal Council, period, when
Danielle won.
Danielle and I have a pact so
that if either one of us wins,
we'll take the other one to the
final.
So we have a 66% chance of
getting to the final.
So we're totally stoked about
that, and we're happy.
Danielle and I are going to
take it to Aras, and we're
going to go to the final.
 There you go, it's got Shane
hair.
This idol is worth about 25
cents right now, I think, in a
pawn shop or something.
It's not worth very much.
But yeah, but that's it for the
hidden immunity idol.
It's no longer a part of this
game, and I got enough wins
under my belt where I didn't
have to use it.
He had some jingly stuff on
it, but I didn't think I could
hide it very well.
 Yeah.
 I flattened it out right
away, and I kept it in my pants
pocket all the time.
 You didn't bring that last
night?
 Oh, yeah.
 You did bring it?
 It was in my shorts.
 Oh.
 It's not that bad-looking of
a guy.
 I thought it was, like, a
rabbit's foot.
 Mm-hmm.
 Aras and I were sitting by
the fire, and Terry just kind of
took the hidden immunity idol
and waved it in Aras' face, and
I think Terry did that
just to... another like strike
at Aras, you know, like ha-ha, I
had the hidden immunity idol.
Ha-ha, I'm the bigger man.
 Aw, suck.
Look at that, almost all the
way through.
 Aras and Terry's
relationship is based on
rivalry.
It's just that macho thing.
I'm definitely caught in the
middle between, you know, these
two guys that have this
testosterone match every day--
who can catch the biggest fish,
the most fish.
Who can beat who?
Who's better?
Who's the tough guy?
They just... they go back and
forth all the time.
 Dude!
 Catch one?
 Five small ones.
One kind of medium and four
small.
 The bad news is that I
caught freaking huge ones.
 No!
All right!
 Oh, beautiful!
 Oh, man!
 Wait, wait, wait.
 Giving us the silent
treatment!
Oh, very nice.
 Good job, Aras!
 That rocks, man!
Fish feast.
Look at the teeth on that
parrot fish.
 Terry and Aras, deep down
inside, we all know that they
don't like each other.
 Eyeball socket.
 The fact that Aras beat out
Terry in the past two
challenges, Terry's ready for
revenge.
I can see it.
So Aras better give him a
run for his money at the
immunity challenge, or else
Aras will be going home.
 PROBST: Come in, guys.
How's it going, guys?
 Awesome.
 Hey, Jeff.
 PROBST: You guys ready to
get to today's challenge?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: All right, well, I
know you were probably expecting
an immunity challenge, but
instead, today you are playing
for reward.
For today's challenge, you will
race to the top of a
three-story climbing wall,
using four individually shaped
pegs to help you get up there.
Here's how it will work: on my
"go," you'll make your way
through a table maze.
When you get to the end of the
maze, you'll release a bag
with your first two pegs.
You'll then move to a spinning
wheel.
Read the clues, and like a
combination lock spin the
wheel, clockwise and
counterclockwise, clockwise
again until you find the one
bag that contains your final
two pegs.
You will use the pegs to help
you get to the top of the wall.
Once you reach the top, place
each of the four pegs in their
individual finish slots.
That will raise the flag.
First person to raise their
flag wins reward.
Want to know what you're
playing for?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Today's reward is
designed specifically to give
the winner a huge advantage in
tomorrow's final immunity
challenge.
Immediately following this
challenge, the winner will sit
down and enjoy a power meal--
chicken breast, vegetables,
fruit, everything your body is
craving right now.
In addition, you will take back
to camp with you an individual
cot, a pillow and a blanket to
help you get a get good night's
sleep.
Could mean the difference
between winning this game and
not.
Worth playing for?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.
This way.
Here we go.
For reward, survivors ready?
Go!
Make your way through the maze.
Once you get to the end, you'll
release the first two pegs.
Aras moving quickly through the
maze.
 What the hell...
 PROBST: Danielle struggling.
 Oh, man!
 PROBST: Terry reaches a dead
end.
Aras drops his first set of
pegs.
He's untying them.
Danielle still struggling.
Terry back on track.
Terry's dropped his first bag.
Aras moving on to the spinning
wheel.
You've got to read the clues.
Spin the wheel in the right
direction, and find the one bag
that contains your final two
pegs.
Terry at the spinning wheel.
Danielle drops her first bag.
Aras and Terry both working on
the bags.
Danielle now in it.
Everybody in this challenge.
Aras thinks he has his second
bag.
Terry found his second set of
pegs.
He's got to get them out of the
bag.
Aras moving on to the wall
first.
Danielle has her second bag.
Aras at the wall.
He's got all four pegs,
starting up.
Got to get to the top with all
four.
Danielle, first pegs are not
right.
They'll be color-coded.
Go back to the start; read the
directions again.
Terry has all four pegs.
He's on the wall.
It's Aras and Terry.
Aras, working the walls.
Got a good strategy.
Terry, sliding down.
Nice move.
Aras, still with a big lead.
Terry, not giving up.
Aras, sliding down.
His shirt saves him.
Aras, hanging from his shirt.
Terry, trying to make up some
ground.
Terry, digging in.
Terry and Aras, neck and neck.
Aras, to the top.
He's got three pegs; he needs
his last one.
Aras frees his last peg.
Aras, to the top.
Terry, right behind him, to the
top.
Got to get 'em in.
Four slots, got to get all four
in and drop your flag.
It's Aras.
Terry, making up ground.
Terry comes from behind to
win reward.
 You are the ultimate
competitor, man, ultimate.
I'm telling you, you work me.
 PROBST: Wow. Incredible.
 Good job, guys.
Good job.
 PROBST: Aras, Terry, another
great challenge between you two
guys.
Terry came out on top.
The good news is because the
hidden immunity idol is no
longer in play, nobody going to
Exile Island.
Aras, Danielle, grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
 Congrats.
 PROBST: Terry, you got some
eating to do.
Get your stuff, go.
 Terry's probably eating
something a little bit nicer,
but, uh, you know what?
This is food, and, uh, we've
been luck today; we've eaten a
lot.
This is going to be our seventh
fish, three of them, pretty
big-size fish.
So don't get me wrong, Terry's
grubbing and he's happy about
it, and that's great for Terry,
but this is great for Aras and
Danielle right now too.
 D, one of us has to win
tomorrow, if one of us wants
to win a million dollars.
 Tomorrow's gonna be like a
willpower one, and I'm not
giving up, so don't worry.
 I'm not worried about you.
I know you're tough as nails, D.
 I will not give up.
 How was it?
 You know what?
It was, uh, it was good.
It wasn't like a crap-load of
food, but it was all good.
 What'd you get?
 Uh, a whole bunch of steamed
vegetables, like, uh,
cauliflower, carrots, string
beans, spinach, and then two
chicken breasts, a big thing of
rice and two pieces of
multigrain bread, like, about 32
ounces of water and then about a
16-ounce protein drink.
That was it.
Oh, and I had a banana, that
was it.
 Oh, yum.
 But, um... that was it.
 Thank you.
 There's absolutely an
advantage to having a meal the
day before the biggest
immunity challenge of the game.
The thing of it is, though, is
it can also be a psychological
disadvantage.
(thunder crashes)
Now the onus to win is really on
you.
I mean, everybody expects you to
win now-- you're super-dad and
you've got all this food in your
body, that kind of puts the
pressure on a little bit for
Terry.
 I hope I have it, I hope I'm
here for two nights.
 I think you'll have to fight
Danielle for that.
 I don't think Terry's
apparent dominance has a
psychological effect on me,
personally.
Everybody and their mother
expects Terry to win this
next immunity challenge.
So I go out there, I give it my
best, I expect me to win.
And if I don't win, well, hey,
I gave it my best.
If I do win, beautiful.
 "A boat will soon arrive to
take you to Exile Island for the
final time.
Collect the torches of those who
came before you, place them on
the skull, raise the Exile flag
and set the skull ablaze as a
tribute to your fallen
comrades.
Prepare yourself for the final
immunity challenge, which will
give one of you the power to
decide who will be the last to
join the jury and who will face
the jury."
It's funny the last three of us
that are still here, the final
three, all have spent the most
days on Exile Island, so, you
know, burning down the skull
will be symbolic like, it's
over, it's done.
 Tina, you were the
first one out.
 For the very short time that
I was there, I would've done
nothing differently.
I don't want anyone to have
any pity upon me for this
experience.
My son died five months ago.
It was the biggest
challenge of my life, and it
will remain the largest
challenge for the rest of my
life.
 Melinda.
 I'm taking away from the
experience, I guess, a little
bit more knowing who I am.
I learned that I'm a lot
tougher, actually, than I even
thought I was.
I mean, it's awful out here.
 Beautiful blue eyes.
 Misty, first person here on
Exile Island.
 It definitely threw me for a
loop at the very beginning.
Being stuck on Exile Island put
me in a vulnerable position, but
mostly, it was a positive
experience all around.
I learned a lot about myself,
and I know that from now on,
whether in life or a game, I'm
never going to go into anything
being anyone other than myself.
 Certainly, this experience
will change my perspective.
I'm coming away, you know, more
grateful, more humble than I
even was coming here.
And to be lucky enough to be
involved in something like this
is, um, it's just a blessing.
 Bob Dog.
 It was great having Bob Dog
at camp, and Bob Dog in the
challenges.
 The thing that I think
will shock people the most is
exactly how beat down you are
when show up each day for those
challenges.
Knowing exactly how debilitated
we were, I mean, it was tough,
but, like I'm a tough dude, I
expect to be able to thrive in
circumstances like this.
I just came out here to, you
know, put the smack-down on a
few fools and maybe take a shot
at a million, and it didn't
work out.
 Dan the man.
 Dan was a confidante.
He was a survivor.
He taught us stuff around camp.
The man had it all, definitely
had the right stuff.
 I expected this to be
interesting and difficult, and
my biggest surprise was that it
was not only interesting and
difficult, but it was fun.
It was fun!
This game was energizing
spiritually.
It was very hard physically.
But, uh, it's a joyous
experience.
 Nick was one of the most
mature, well-spoken and
well-mannered 24-year-old kids I
have ever met.
 The first 12 days were the
most miserable days, perhaps in
my life, but, uh, without
question, this was the hardest
but yet one of the most
rewarding experiences I've ever
had.
 Austin.
 This is a tough game.
It really is.
I had no idea coming out here
how hard it was going to be.
All I know is that it is such an
honor to be able to play the
game of Survivor, and that honor
is just magnified by having a
chance to sit on the jury and
have a say in who walks away
with a million bucks.
 Survivor Sal.
 It was fun having Sally
around camp.
She's a real sweetheart, a
real genuine girl.
 My Survivor experience was
everything I could've imagined
or hoped, and then to say, I
made it to the final eight was
thrilling.
 Bruce, sensei.
 Such a kindhearted man.
 I came to this, probably, one
of the smallest and the oldest
person, but I've always been
challenged that way as either
the smallest, weakest,
last-picked all the time, and so
I just relish that kind of
challenge to prove people wrong.
The hardest part was getting
sick and being sick for days.
And that was probably the most
excruciating pain in my life,
but that made me think a lot and
I felt, uh, coming off the
island, I was a much stronger
person.
 Courtney.
 It's been a rollercoaster of
a ride for me.
My life is about growth, it's
about experience, and it's about
living your dreams, and this is
my current dream, and I lived
it, and I did the best that I
could.
I stayed the real me throughout
it all.
You know what?
I'm not going to be handed a
million dollars, but I'm going
to make it on my own.
 Shane.
Wow. Crazy, ugly, beautiful...
insane, somebody who I will
always, always hold in my heart.
 I feel completely at peace
with the way I played the game.
And there are so many things
that I have learned about me,
about what I'm capable of, about
what I can do, which is
anything.
And that's only going to make me
a stronger and more effective
person to the planet.
And I'm going to remember this
experience forever.
 Cirie was the mom around
camp.
I mean, she was just amazing.
 I felt like this was a
life-changing experience for
me, just in the fact that I
won't be as fearful of the
unknown.
Because that's what kind of
kept me on the couch.
Hopefully, it won't be as big a
part of my life anymore, being
that I've overcome a lot of
things that I would have never
thought I could have done
before.

(fire crackling)
 PROBST: So how did this
morning go, Aras?
 This morning was nice.
We got to pay our respects to
the 13 other members, and I
think most important for all of
us, is the burning of the
skull, knowing that none of us
ever have to spend another
night there.
 PROBST: All right, you guys
ready to get to your final
immunity challenge?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: First things first:
Aras, give it up.
For the last time, immunity is
back up for grabs.
For today's final immunity
challenge, you must balance on
a series of floating platforms.
We will start on the largest of
the four platforms.
Every 15 minutes you'll move to
the next smallest platform.
As the platform gets smaller,
it will get tougher to keep
your balance.
If we make it to the last
platform, there will be no time
limit.
We will go until there's only
one person left.
Here are the rules: only your
feet can touch the platform.
If your hands or your bottom
touch the platform, you're out.
If you fall off, you're out.
At the end of every 15 minutes
that round will be over, you'll
crawl over to the next platform,
you'll have one minute to
regain your balance, we'll
begin again.
Last person left standing, wins
immunity, guaranteed a spot in
the final two and decides who
sits next to them at that final
Tribal Council.
Clear?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: All right, we'll get
started.
Everybody step onto your first
platform and get your balance.
This challenge has begun.
15 minutes on this first
platform.
How you feeling, Terry?
Doing all right, Danielle?
Aras?
Nobody wants to talk.
I understand.
This challenge requires intense
concentration.
Lose your focus for just a
moment, you'll be in the water.
We're now at the ten minute
mark.
Five more minutes on this
platform, we move to the next
one.
Terry's looking very strong.
Aras has not moved.
Danielle's very steady.
 There's tons of fish on the
bottom.
Should have had a drop line
with us.
 PROBST: You want to put your
drop line in here?
 Yeah, I see some huge fish.
 PROBST: Even in the middle
of a challenge, Danielle
thinking about food.
 (laughs)
 PROBST: 15 seconds left in
this round.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Crawl onto your next platform.
Find a new balance point.
You have one minute.
This will be a little more
difficult, less room.
You'll feel the effects of the
water more.
Everybody's up.
Challenge is back on.
You're eight minutes in, over
halfway.
Aras wobbling just a bit, but
recovering.
Danielle very steady.
Terry very steady.
15 seconds left in this round.
Three, two, one.
Crawl to your third platform.
This is where you will begin to
notice a significant increase
in difficulty.
You have one minute to get into
a standing position.
45 seconds left.
Nobody panicking.
Everybody taking their time.
That's it, Aras.
Aras is up.
That's it, Terry.
Fight to find it.
Aras holding steady.
Terry still struggling.
You've got 30 seconds, Terry.
20 second left to get those
hands up.
Danielle is up.
Aras is up.
Terry, you need to get up in 15
seconds.
14, 13.,,
This is it, Terry.
Ten seconds.
Aras and Danielle are up.
Terry's having trouble getting
up.
Four, three, put your hands up,
Terry.
You've got to do it.
Terry is up.
At the last second, he found
balance.
Everybody is up.
The challenge is back on.
Terry cannot hang on.
The first person out of this
challenge.
It's down to Aras and Danielle
for final immunity.
Aras is out of the challenge,
Danielle wins immunity.
Danielle going to the final two.
Danielle, come on over.
The first one, but it couldn't
come at a better time, huh?
You are safe at tonight's vote.
You're guaranteed a spot in the
final two.
And at Tribal Council tonight,
you will decide whether it is
Terry or Aras that sits next to
you at that final Tribal
Council.
Big decision.
You have the opportunity to
figure it out.
Get your stuff.
Bring the boat in.
 God never makes it easy for
me.
The one immunity challenge I
win is a last one, and it's a
huge decision that I have to
make tonight-- who do I want to
take with me to the final two,
either Aras or Terry?
So, I mean, it was so
gratifying to win the last
immunity challenge, but at the
same time, my brain started
thinking right away.
I knew I had a decision to make
tonight that could cost me or
earn me a million dollars.
It's difficult because I told
Terry when I was on Exile
Island with him that if either
of us won, we would take each
other, but then it's like,
during the challenge, Aras,
you know, I gave him, like, a
head nod, and so he jumped off,
thinking that I would take him
to the finals.
And that doesn't mean anything
right now, because, at this
point, there's a million
dollars at stake, and I'm not
going to take somebody because I
made a promise to them.
I'm going to take someone who I
think I have a better chance of
beating.
 The big question.
 Do you feel that it's
fair for me to take someone
that I think can beat me?
 Um, I-I...
 As someone in my position
right now, because I didn't
expect to be in this position,
to be honest with you.
 Right, right.
Um, had I won today, I would
have already told you that you
were going to the finals with
me.
You want to put this down?
 Yeah.
I know, I'm just trying to... I
did not expect to be in this
position, and if you had given
me the hidden immunity idol, I
would have 100% took you.
 Right, right.
 Without any question, it
wouldn't be an issue right now.
I'm not saying I'm not taking
you, 'cause I haven't...
 Right.
 I'm just trying to go over
everything in my head and go
over... you know, and if you
were in my shoes, you would do
the same thing.
You want to...
 Right, right.
 You would want to bring
someone... and it's a toss-up.
 You haven't...
 It's not like one of you is
better to bring than the other.
So I'm just, like, freaking out
because I won't... I don't...
I don't know.
 Danielle is finding herself
very confused right now, and,
oh, God, I hope she's not
confused when it comes to the
point of choos... taking me to
the finals.
If I were a betting man, I would
choose me only because of the
Casaya loyalty, and it would be
an easy decision.
 But by me taking you, they're
gonna look at it as I'm already
being disloyal to them 'cause
I...
 No, no, because then it just
makes the picture more black and
white.
"Oh, guys, yeah, I'm here.
Thanks, you know?
I kinda won a bunch of
challenges and then was the
nail in your side, you know?
Can I please have your vote?"
Uh-uh, I don't think that's
happening.
And I know it's gonna be hard.
 I just hope you will respect
whatever decision I make.
I honestly haven't made a
decision and I don't know what
I'm gonna do.
 I have to. I have to.
I'm not gonna sit there and
throw daggers at you with my
eyes from the jury, okay?
 Please.
 And it's been fun.
 It has been fun.
And this sucks.
I can't deal with this decision.
I hate... I'm so indecisive as
it is because I'm a Gemini.
 Okay, I think I'm gonna jump
in the water.
I think the tide was still going
out.
 Yeah, I think so, too.
No doubt about it.
When Terry and Danielle went to
get water, I had my first bit of
paranoia in this game, more
than just a bit.
I was, like, "Man, what's going
on?
Are they talking about me?
I mean, I know they're talking
about me, but is she gonna get
swayed?
Is Terry gonna be able to sway
her, bla-bla, bla?
My mind starts racing.
Like, I would just feel so
burned if, like, you voted for
Terry instead of me, and my
dumbass jumped off the lily pad
because you said "Yeah," you
know?
 I haven't... I'm just going
over stuff in my head.
This is a huge decision.
 I know.
 I wasn't expecting to win
this today.
Like, I wasn't expecting it to
go my way.
 I think, honestly, I think
you have ten times better chance
against me than Terry, and
that's not trying to be
manipulative, but if you do vote
Terry, then you lose me and
Cirie anyways.
 All right.
 I thought we were golden once
you said we are.
 We, we really, we pretty much
are.
 Pretty much are?
You can't, D, you can't do this
to me.
 I need to go off by myself
and just think about this.
 Either way, would you tell me
either way so I don't go in
like an idiot?
 Yes, yes, yes.
 And remember that you did
give me your word when I was on
the lily pad.
 I know, I know, I know.
All right, I'll be back.
 All right.
 Listening to Aras' sales
pitch was just mind-boggling.
Aras is all about honesty and
integrity, but, in the same
sense, he's contradicting
himself because he's basically
threatening me.
 You better bring me, I swear
to God.
I will be shocked if you don't,
let's just say that.
 All right. (groans)
Part of Aras' sales pitch to me
was that he would not vote for
me if I took Terry, so I would
lose his vote and Cirie's vote,
which I think is completely
messed up.
Aras is very manipulative, so
that's why I'm kinda hesitant to
take him or even listen to what
he says because I want the
million dollars.
I'm not gonna base my losing a
million dollars to, "Oh, told
Aras I would take him."
I'm gonna go with what I think.
This is how I've played this
game so far and I believe that's
why I'm where I am right now.
 You know what?
It's your decision to make.
You won the thing today, so if
you think I'll be better to
take, do that.
If you think Aras would be
better to take, do that.
 Okay.
 Terry, regardless, man.
It's been a pleasure.
It's been a journey with you,
man.
Battle on.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury:
Austin, Sally...
Bruce, Courtney...
Shane and Cirie.
Let's talk about the final
immunity challenge.
The two big dogs, Terry and
Aras, don't come through,
and Danielle, suddenly, you're
sitting in the most enviable
position in this game.
How does it feel having that
immunity necklace around you?
 It feels great and it was an
honor to be able to win the most
important challenge of the
entire game, but the decision
that I have to make tonight is
one of the most difficult
decisions I've probably, I will
have to make ever in my life.
It's like a scary feeling 'cause
I'm not sure which way I want to
go, and my brain is about to
explode out of my head.
So I just wanted them both to
understand and respect where I'm
coming from and just don't hate
me after this.
 PROBST: Terry, you played
this game as competitively as it
can be played for 38 days.
Are you able to respect the
position that Danielle's in?
 That part of not winning the
last immunity challenge, it's
frustrating to have come through
this with both the hidden
immunity idol and the necklace
most of the time.
 PROBST: So you did have the
hidden immunity idol?
 Oh yeah, oh, yeah.
Had that the whole time.
Uh, I can separate myself
because I have to.
It's a different part of the
game than the competition side.
It's a number-crunching thing.
You know, I think it's in my
better interest and her better
interest to go with my side.
But it's now a mental thing for
her to go through, but you know,
do I want to go home tonight?
No stinking way.
 PROBST: Aras, you come up to
Danielle who you've been with in
the same tribe and the same
alliance for a long time.
What do you say at this point?
 To be honest with you, I
thought I was golden.
And obviously, it's a big
decision for D, I understand
that, and she's starting to
worry, and then I begin to get a
little paranoid, so I just told
her, this is, like, basically
the situation, it's in both of
our best interests to be in the
final two together.
We have the best shot, and
that's kinda how I threw it out
there.
 PROBST: Danielle, as you
think about this more and more,
does it get more and more
complicated?
 Yeah, it is.
I just feel like crying.
Like, right after you put the
necklace around my neck, I just
started thinking about it and I
haven't stopped since...
I'm still thinking about it.
I mean, I'm just... Ah!
I don't know.
 PROBST: Okay, let's get to
the vote.
Danielle has immunity.
You cannot vote for her, so
Aras, you can only vote for
Terry, Terry can only vote for
Aras.
Your votes cancel each other
out.
Danielle will be the only
person to vote.
In doing so, you will vote the
14th person out of this game and
you will also decide who's gonna
sit next to you at the final
Tribal Council.
It is time to vote.
Danielle, you're up.
♪ ♪
I'll go get the vote.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the vote.
The 14th person voted out of
Survivor: Exile Island...
Terry. You need to bring me your
torch.
 Thank you.
 Wow.
 PROBST: Terry, the tribe has
spoken.
 Thanks for the journey, you
guys.
 PROBST: Danielle, Aras,
congratulations.
You've made it as far as you can
go in this game.
The power now shifts to the
jury and the decision they will
ultimately make.
You two have one more night in
Panama.
Enjoy it.
See you tomorrow for final
Tribal Council.
Grab your torches.
Back to camp. Good night.
 The biggest mistake I made
was not keeping the game in my
own hands and then relying on
somebody else to take care of it
for me.
That's what got me.
But, uh, it was not bad for a
46-year-old guy.
And I hope I made my friends and
family proud, and Terry Dietz is
not a perfect guy, and there's
always room for better change.
 Oh, my God. Final two.
D, I'm so happy!
We're the two youngest people in
the game, I think.
 I know.
 It was a tense, tense Tribal
Council for me, and it made
getting into the final two that
much sweeter for me.
I mean, I am ecstatic right now.
I'm so happy.
Oh, my God, we did it, girl.
 We did it.
Do you think they were shocked
that I picked Terry, or do you
think they knew that?
 I think they knew that.
 Yeah.
 Oh, come here.
Regardless of the results, I
played this game the full 39
days, I played it with integrity
and I played it with a lot of
intensity, and more importantly
than anything else, I really
enjoyed myself out here.
Oh, my gosh.
 I can't believe it.
 I'm so glad it's me and you,
too.
 I know.
It's great.
 Just chilling tonight.
 Who would've thought, huh?
 The reason why I decided to
take Aras is because Aras is a
part of the former Casaya Tribe.
 Whoa, everything must burn.
For me at the end, to go ahead
and pick Terry over Aras, I
think would've been a slap in
everybody's face.
So, my gut choice was Aras.
That's just what it was and I
went with it.
That's what I've been doing this
entire game, and I think that's
why I've gotten this far.
I can't believe this is the last
night.
 The last night.
Today would've been the hardest
day to go home, I think,
'cause you're so close.
 Yeah, yeah.
My job isn't done yet.
I'm still not satisfied.
I'm in sales, so hopefully, I
can, uh, do some persuading to
the jury and hope for the best.
Because I want that million
dollars, I don't want to settle
for anything less than first
place.
 Ah...
 Look at that.
 Oh, my God.
 Get out of Dodge.
 Yay! Thank you, Lord!
 "Congratulations.
You've outwitted, outlasted and
outplayed 14 others.
Now there are seven who hold
your fate in their hands.
So relax and enjoy your final
day on the island, because
tonight you will be held
accountable and one of you will
be named the sole survivor."
 Oh! I'm so happy.
 We need to cook the eggs.
 Yeah, we do.
 To our surprise, there was
milk, orange juice, champagne,
pancake mix, eggs.
 You want to have a glass of
orange juice right now or do you
want to have a mimosa?
 Let's have a mimosa right
now.
 All right.
 Everything that we were
craving was just right there, at
tree mail.
 Thank you for this wonderful
food!
 Feels great.
I need some fat in my body right
now.
 Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.
 Mmm!
 This is so bomb.
 We're going to go for a walk
now and enjoy some champagne and
put everything into perspective
our last day here.
You know, leave a game that
sometimes didn't feel so civil
in a very civil manner.
 Oh!
(glass shatters)
(groans)
 Oh, that's nasty.
I've been out on those rocks
maybe a hundred times.
I'm not really sure exactly how
I went down, but I knew right
away something was wrong.
I tried to get up, I was kind of
lightheaded.
I thought I was going to faint.
 39 days and Aras
does this on the last day.
 I was a little nervous
when Aras was saying he felt
faint, you know, I was getting
a little nervous, 'cause I saw
all the blood.
 The thought of seeing blood
scares me and to actually see it
gushing out like it did, freaked
me out, absolutely.
So it looks like he's going to
have to get some stitches.
It's pretty bad.
 ...I've seen better days.
 I got a cut in my back.
There was a shard, I had to pull
it out.
It was pretty deep in there.
 Drug him up.
 Are you just going to numb
the whole hand?
 No, just around where the
lacerations are, mate.
Get a 23-gauge.
This is going to be a bit of a
sting, as you know.
 Burning.
 Uh!
I was trying to watch them stick
the needle in.
I was just imagining it being
myself, and it just looked so
painful.
 Had to keep it interesting on
day 39, you know.
 Last day.
 He ended up getting three
stitches on one side of his
finger, four stitches on the
palm of his hand, and then
another stitch on his back.
 You don't think I'll feel
anything tonight?
 So, I mean, he got stitched
up pretty nice.
 I got my butt kicked out here
by the elements.
I got my butt kicked by Terry
Deitz a lot of the time.
I got my butt kicked by my own
shortsightedness-- falling down
on the rocks.
Despite the fact that I made it
39 days, I feel like my ego has
been crushed.
I feel so stupid for falling.
 It's so funny, day 39 this
happens.
I just feel terrible.
 Don't feel like that.
It was an accident.
 I wanted to, like, go out...
cool thing and then I go out.
 This day was definitely your
day.
 My day to be a...
I kind of came in as a buffoon
and I kind of went out as a
buffoon, and in between I did
some pretty cool things.
That's life.
I mean, you fall, you get back
up and you try again.
Sometimes you need to get
stitched up before you can try
again.
Falling down and hurting myself
today reminded me just how human
I am, and reminded me just how
much of a game this is.
What that is is saying, "Look,
Aras, you don't have to be a
superman, you don't have to be a
superhero and you'll be okay."
And so, with that perspective,
coming into Tribal Council,
maybe I'll be able to connect
with people at a deeper level.
That's the hope.
 I can't really say there's
one thing that I've learned
about myself that I didn't know
coming into this.
It just drew a clearer picture
for me.
It let me know I'm strong,
you know, I'm a strong,
independent woman, and I knew I
could get through it, and I did
it.
I'm so proud of myself, I
really am.
I just hope people dig deep
tonight in the jury.
I hope they pick the right
person, being me.
 You all packed up?
 Yeah.
It's like weird.
 It is weird, isn't it?
This is the last day.
Come here, stand up, give me a
hug.
Oh, whatever happens tonight, D,
I'm so happy I got to share this
with you.
This has been an amazing ride.
And hopefully, there will be an
amazing reward at the end of it.
But I'm just so grateful that I
got the time out here that I
got.
I'll never forget the moments
that I spent out here, and the
people that I spent the moments
with.
 PROBST: I'll now bring in the
members of the jury.
Austin, Sally...
Bruce, Courtney, Shane,
Cirie, and Terry, voted out at
the last Tribal Council.
Welcome to your final Tribal
Council.
Before we get to the proceedings
tonight, Aras, you're bandaged
up, what happened?
 Danielle and I were walking
out to the rocks to like spend
one last moment together.
And these rocks I must've been
on 50 times, you know,
throughout this game, and I just
slipped, and I split my palm and
my pinky, and the medical team
came in and stitched me up all
over the place.
But I'm all right now.
 PROBST: Well, the good news
is you won't be going back to
that beach anymore.
Congratulations to you both
because you have done what 14
other people weren't able to do
in this game-- make it to the
final two.
But the power tonight shifts
away from you two, over
to the jury.
Seven people that you two either
directly or indirectly had a
hand in voting out of this game
now hold your fate in their
hands.
Tonight, they will decide who
they think is most deserving of
the title of sole survivor and
the million-dollar check
that goes along with it.
Here's how it's going to work.
You'll each get a chance to make
an opening statement, this is an
opportunity to make your case
about why you deserve to win
this game.
Then the jury will get the first
chance to address you with a
comment or a question.
Then you'll get a chance for a
final, closing comment.
Make sense?
 Yeah.
Opening statements-- Aras.
 Wow, guys.
Um, first, I just want to say
thank you.
This has been an amazing
experience for me.
And I hope when you guys vote
tonight, that you guys will
look at the way that I played
the game.
You know, I worked my butt off
at camp, I think.
I worked hard in the challenges.
And I really made an effort to
get to know each one of you,
not because I wanted your vote,
but I really feel like I made
an effort to get to know you
guys and connect.
I set out to play this game
with honesty and integrity, and
I feel like for the most part I
did that.
And I hope that you guys will
see that.
And honestly, whichever way you
guys decide to vote, it's been
an amazing experience.
 PROBST: Danielle.
 Guys, just want to thank you
for making this an unbelievable
journey for me.
I just came into this thinking
that I just wanted to be myself.
I wanted to do the best that I
could do out here.
I wanted to build relationships.
I wanted to seek out who I
could trust and who I could
relate to.
I mean, in a perfect world,
everybody wants to play this
game with integrity and
honesty, but let's be realistic
here.
I mean, at some point in the
game, you're going to have to
deceive somebody, and you just
have to make that decision
whether it's the right time to
do that.
Anyways, to get down to the
point-- this is going to be a
difficult decision for you guys.
I just hope you make the right
decision.
 PROBST: All right, jury, in
a moment, you're going to get
your first chance to address
Danielle and Aras.
I'll give you a minute to think
about what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right, jury, some
of you have been waiting a long
time for this: your first
opportunity to address Danielle
and Aras to get the information
you need to make a million
dollar vote.
Let's get started.
Sally, you're up first.
 Hey, guys.
Congratulations to you both.
You should feel very proud of
where you're sitting.
You guys worked hard, and I
really haven't made my decision
yet, so I do have a question
that I'm going to ask.
Of the six original Casaya
members that you had such a
strong connection with that I
could not for the life of me
figure out how to get into, of
those six, who contributed the
most to why you're sitting
there?
Danielle, you can go first.
 Cirie would be the one
person that I would say is the
reason why I'm sitting here.
I just had a connection with
her.
I was at Exile six days out of
the 39 days.
And when you come back from
Exile Island, you don't know
what's been going on, so I
always had Cirie to fill me in,
and she did.
And I always trusted her.
 Thank you.
Aras.
 Ironically, I also would say
Cirie.
One, just as a friend.
You need to have somebody you
can just relate to, and then at
other times it's strategic.
And we helped each other.
We took each other on a reward.
It was a mutually beneficial
relationship.
But I think if I had to single
out one person, Cirie would be
the person.
 Congratulations again.
Thank you so much.
 PROBST: Bruce.
 Wow, I get to address you
guys and congratulations.
You guys battled like real
samurai warriors to me, both
of you.
Now we have the responsibility
of deciding who's going to get
that million dollars.
And what I want to know is,
beyond the million dollars, if
you were given that, what are
you going to be doing with that
responsibility?
That's what I'd like to know.
 PROBST: Aras.
 To be honest, Bruce, I don't
know if I can inspire anybody
else unless I change myself.
And so for me, my focus at the
age that I am is really, like,
can I make myself a better
person, and hopefully, through
that, that will inspire other
people.
I don't know if that worked.
 PROBST: Danielle.
 I would love to just share
my experiences, maybe just give
speeches to younger children
and let them know you can
really do anything you put your
mind to.
I mean, I never in a million
years thought I'd be sitting in
this seat right now, and I would
just love to share my
experiences with other people
and encourage them to do
whatever they want.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Terry.
 Danielle, I'd first like
to make a comment, that your
part about deceiving somebody
and having to do it sometime
during the game is totally
off-base.
After 38 days, I never came
close to deceiving anyone.
Somewhere down the line,
Danielle, I hope that your
family and friends and the
ringing in your ears doesn't
say "should have taken the navy
guy."
Okay, the out-play portion of
Survivor, in my book, revolves
around the competitions.
So what I want you to do is
rate yourself, one through ten,
and why you gave yourself a one
to ten rating.
Aras.
 I give myself a nine.
I busted my butt at every
challenge.
And I think everybody here did,
basically.
I don't know anybody who
wasn't, like, pumped up for a
challenge, and I have no
regrets about any of the
challenges, except maybe
wishing I got a peg in
somewhere quicker than somebody
else got a peg in, or something
like that.
 Danielle.
 I would give myself an eight
and a half, nine, only because
I would give myself higher if I
didn't take the cheeseburger
over that challenge.
I'm still kicking myself in the
ass for that.
But every other challenge, I
put in 110% on that field.
I just gave it my all.
So I'd say closer to a nine.
 That's it.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Thank you, Terry.
Austin, you're up.
 First off, congratulations
to the both of you.
Aras, sorry to hear about your
hand, man.
What I want you guys to do, I
want you to tell me one
incident you think you made a
very positive, good move, and
then one incident that you did
something that wasn't
necessarily completely on the
up-and-up, both of which helped
you kind of navigate your way to
where you are right now.
 PROBST: We'll start with
Danielle.
 I think the first move that I
did that helped me get some
control in this game was to
persuade people not to vote
Bruce off and to vote Bob Dog
off.
I just feel like that was the
first move where I gained a
little bit of control in the
game.
And the second move, obviously,
was voting Courtney off,
because Courtney was one of the
closest people that I bonded
with here.
That was one of the hardest
things I had to do.
 Okay, thanks.
 PROBST: Aras.
 Probably the...
the move that I'm proudest I
made was telling Melinda she
was going to be home.
To be the second person voted
off and to not know you're
going home...
Like Shane didn't know if he was
going to stay or not, and
Melinda's hopes got up.
But I felt good that she at
least knew she was going home,
as opposed to coming in like
super-stoked that she was going
to make it three more days and
get blindsided.
Something that I wasn't so proud
of: Shane, the vote off for
Shane.
I had to break the alliance with
Shane and I ended up saying
things to Shane that weren't
true, and I felt bad about that.
But I do think I played this
game with lots of integrity,
and for the most part, every
move I made, I felt really good
about.
 Congratulations again to the
both of you guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Austin.
Courtney.
 Oh, boy!
I forgot my guns.
They've been dropped in the sea
of forgiveness.
Whew!
Wow!
I came in here wanting to play
with integrity and to be of
light and love and this shining
being, and, wow, did I struggle
with that.
Because you certainly both
stabbed me in the back with a
knife that was very deep, and
it took me about a week to
remove it from my back it was
so deep, especially from
Danielle, who, which I had
total trust in her.
I never was going to vote you
out.
I don't know who made up that
lie, but I'm holding no chip on
my shoulder, because chips on
your shoulder of regret and
anger weigh you down.
And I'm a bird, so I gotta fly.
But more so than anything, I
learned a ton about myself, and
that points me to my question.
For you and through this
experience, more than the game
and the money and the
la-la-la-la, what did you really
learn about yourself that you're
going to take out of here and
walk with every single day?
 PROBST: Aras.
 I hope you don't think I
stabbed you in the back,
because we both put each
other's name on the parchment,
just...
 Well, you did, lie, but
that's okay.
 And you know what, you know
what, I take full responsibility
for that, I did.
And I and do not profess to say
that I was completely honest out
here.
And so I guess for me, one thing
I can say is my ego has been
smashed.
 And that is going to
strengthen your spiritual way.
I mean, my ego was smashed into
smithereens, and you need it,
because it's going to be tough
out there.
 That's right.
 PROBST: Danielle.
 I didn't realize how
mentally strong I can be and
how mentally tough this whole
adventure was for me.
Like, there were so many times
where I just was like, "I can't
do this."
 Well, in a sense, that is the
beautiful gift, then, that this
gave you, is that, in a sense,
you've learned to be able to be
still within yourself, just
you, not having Dad take care
of you or your boyfriend take
care of you or anyone.
 Thank you for pointing that
out for me.
 Well, you know, we're all
here for each other in one way
or another, and my life is to
learn.
And I'm glad we've all learned
something, and we're all going
to walk on a higher road.
 PROBST: Thanks, Courtney.
Cirie.
 Well, um, hard to follow
Courtney.
I would imagine that you both
have realized each other's
strengths and attributes.
I would like both of you to
tell me why my vote should be
for the person sitting next to
you.
 PROBST: Danielle.
 Aras is unbelievable.
Honorable, respectful, strong-
minded, and a great morale for
the team.
Just a great person.
 PROBST: Aras.
 When I hurt my hand today,
Danielle was there, and she
walked me up to the beach and
just held a towel over my hand
to put pressure on it, and just
basically helped save my ass.
On a night where she could just
be worrying about what she's
going to say to Tribal Council,
she put all that aside.
That for me was really
touching, and to be in that
situation, I felt like, wow,
Danielle is a really
spectacular person.
 I did tell the doctor
to drug you, though.
 She did tell the doctor to
drug me up, which hopefully
they'll do later.
 I was kidding.
 Good luck, guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Cirie.
Shane.
 Fun.
First of all, congratulations.
The last two, I'm disappointed
that it's the both of you.
I wish that Terry would have
been there.
I believe that Terry is the
most deserving person of the 16
to win the million dollars.
I'm going to tell you why I
think you guys are both
undeserving.
Danielle, you were useless at
camp.
The only time you were ever
motivated to do anything was
when it was time to eat.
And the outwit part, I don't
know, because at the end of the
day, I was with you for 33
days, and I don't know anything
about you.
I know you can't complete a
coherent sentence, and you
contradict yourself all the
time.
And that's a drag.
Aras, we had an agreement on
what was most important to both
of us, my son and your yoga,
which, at this point, is sort
of laughable and contradictory.
But we had an agreement, a
bond, and when it came time to
make the hard decision, I
signed Danielle's name, and you
signed mine.
Danielle, you didn't lie to me.
You played the game straight up.
 I didn't lie to you.
 You didn't lie to me at all.
I have no beef with the way you
played that part of the game.
Aras, you lied, you cheated,
and you wrecked me, personally.
You know, you're young, you're
a good kid.
You're striving to do the right
thing, but we cannot judge
people based on their
intentions.
If I'm judged on my intentions,
I'd be president of the planet.
I have to be judged on my
actions, and I've learned that
through experience.
You are broke, you are homeless
and you freeload off your dad.
So you don't know what it's
like to be judged.
And that is why I cannot vote
for you.
And I don't know who to vote
for.
And I can't abstain.
So this is what we're going to
do.
We're going to have a little
challenge.
Number between one and, very
fittingly, a million.
I want you guys both to pick
one.
 PROBST: Aras.
 Four.
 PROBST: Danielle.
 Ten.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Okay, the jury has
had their say.
Some good questions, some
interesting comments, and a
challenge.
You'll have one last chance to
make your case about why you
deserve the million dollars and
the title of sole survivor.
I'm going to give you a minute
to think about what you want to
say.
 PROBST: All right, Danielle
and Aras, a lot's been said
tonight.
This is your last chance to
make your case with the jury.
Danielle, final comments.
 Um, like I said, I wanted to
come into this game and be
strong, be myself, form the
right alliances, be observant
of what was going on, never
feel comfortable, and I feel
like I did play this game with
honesty and integrity and there
did come a point when I did
have to make a decision to
deceive somebody that I did
align with.
Shane, I know you said that I
was useless around camp.
I feel like I grew a lot,
skill-wise.
Maybe you didn't see it, but
personally, I felt like I grew.
And the outwit part of this, I
just feel like I aligned with
the right people.
I found a couple people that
I really trusted, and I stuck
with them.
And I'm asking you guys to just
look at the three components of
this game-- the outwit, the
outplay, and outlast-- and I
think I did all three of them
fairly well.
I hope you guys vote for me.
I have so much going on right
now in my life, and this could
really help me.
So there you have it.
 PROBST: Aras.
 Guys, again, I know this is
a tough choice for all of you,
every single one of you.
I played this game the best way
that I knew how.
I worked my butt off at camp.
I worked hard in the challenges.
I worked hard at establishing
real relationships with each
and every one of you, and I
mean that.
Shane, I'm really sorry that
you think that I was going to
try to screw you first.
I was under the assumption that
you were trying to screw me.
Those hugs that you and I would
have at the fireside at night
were real, and that was real.
So if you're thinking about
voting for someone who needs
the money, I'm homeless and
I freeload off my dad.
Help me get out of that
situation, brother.
But honestly, guys, we all
played it the best way we know
how.
I hope you guys can look at the
situation and say, "Wow, Aras
played it really well."
if you guys say D played it
better, that's cool, too.
It was a real challenging
experience, and my closing
words are just thank you guys
for being a part of that
experience.
 PROBST: Okay, tonight, jury,
you are voting for a winner.
You're writing down the name
of the person you think most
deserving of the million
dollars.
Aras, Danielle, you want to see
your name on the parchment
tonight.
It is time to vote.
Austin, you're up.
 Danielle, what a great
pleasure to have shared this
experience with you.
I know you're going to hold
this position with due honor and
you'll touch a lot of people's
lives.
The best years of your life
have yet to come.
 I am just so used to writing
this name down, of the two of
you, you are head and shoulders
the winner.
Congratulations.
 PROBST: I'll go get the
votes.
Aras, Danielle, jury, thank you
for a great 39 days.
I know you two are especially
excited to have these votes
read.
You're going to have to wait
until we get back to the States.
I'll see you there.
(applause)
(cheering and applause)
 PROBST: All right.
Let's get to it.
You guys ready for this?
All right, have a seat.
Everybody have a seat.
Nice warm welcome.
Jury.
 Jeff.
 PROBST: Aras, Danielle, I
gotta say, this is a tough game
to play.
And I think until you play it
or witness it firsthand, which
is as close as I'm ever going
to get, you really can't
appreciate it.
So I congratulate you guys on
coming out and taking this
endeavor on.
And especially Aras and
Danielle, to you two for making
it this far.
Let's get to it.
Seven votes in here.
Four votes to win.
At stake, title of sole
survivor and a check for a
million bucks.
Ready?
I'll read the votes.
(laughter)
First vote... Aras.
(cheering and applause)
 PROBST: Danielle.
One vote Aras, one vote
Danielle.
Danielle.
Obviously, this is Shane's vote.
And the answer to his question
of what was the number between
one and a million.
That's two votes, Danielle, one
vote Aras.
Aras.
We're tied, two votes to two.
Aras.
Three votes Aras, two votes
Danielle.
It takes four votes to win.
The winner of Survivor: Exile
Island, Aras.
(cheers and applause)
