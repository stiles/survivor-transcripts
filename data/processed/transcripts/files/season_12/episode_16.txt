 --- 

         Gotcha. That's first time.
 You have no respect for
anybody else out here.
 That's a real mature
comeback.
 PROBST: Go! Whoa! Easy, guys!
Two battering rams!
There's an obvious competition
between you two.
 He's a bad dude and I want to
go out there and beat him.








 That rubs me the wrong way
when you say that.
 Yes!
 He's feeding my fire.
The more he does it, the more I
want to beat him.
 PROBST: Aras sliding down!
Terry and Aras neck-and-neck.
 I apologize for going
personal like that on you.
Straight up.
 I accept that.
 Aras wins immunity!
 Terry and I, through our








conflict, we've helped each
other grow.

 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Exile Island Reunion
Show.
We are live at the Ed Sullivan
Theater here in New York City.
We have all 16 Survivors.
We're gonna talk about the
season starting with our winner,
Aras. Congratulations.
 Thank you.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: You're a
millionaire!
Let me tell you.
You are gonna get a check
tomorrow morning for a million
dollars, and I have one piece of
advice...
 Taxes.
 PROBST: Pay your taxes.
(laughter)
Let's talk about...
I think the biggest thing in
terms of the last few weeks is
the rivalry... rivalry between
you and Terry.
Probably the most significant
personal rivalry we've ever had
on this show.
How big a part did that play in
you doing so well, in keeping
your performance so high?
 It was huge.
Terry is an awesome competitor.
He beat me in almost everything
I did.
And it was just great to have
somebody like that to go up
against.
If you just look at it from a
strategic point of view, if
Terry doesn't win immunity and
someone else does, I go home,
so...
 PROBST: Let's explain that
because, you know, there's this
hidden immunity idol this
season, which really never
played in the show in terms
of you actually playing
it, but I think what you're
talking about is the fact that
you continued to have that
insured your safety.
 Right, 'cause if somebody
else wins immunity, then he's
gonna use his hidden immunity
idol, and his vote is always
Aras, so it's Aras going home.
 PROBST: So Terry really...
You had a big impact in Aras
becoming a millionaire in a lot
of different ways.
(laughter)
I want to know about your take
on Aras, because there was a lot
of sort of father-son, would
maybe be a way to say it in
terms of how you dealt with
Aras.
Did you respect that rivalry as
it was going?
 I respected it totally, and
for him to do what he did near
the end and apologize for
something, and what I needed to
do was listen to what he had to
say, and I had to be grown-up
enough to listen, and he was
totally man enough to do what he
did, and two mature guys getting
it on, strapping it on and
making it happen, it was great.
 PROBST: Terry, you deserve a
real big congratulations
because...
Yeah, absolutely.
(cheers, applause)
Because this is really...
You got your own fan club here.
This is really in a lot of ways,
numbers are very important in
this game.
You didn't have the number.
Week after week after week after
week you had your back up
against the wall.
Casaya was very strong as a
tribe, and you continued to
dominate, and it was impressive
to watch, and I wondered how
much of that... was there some
frustration on your part?
Because you made a couple of
comments about moms not being as
important-- it is Mother's Day.
You know, you made a comment to
Cirie about "What on Earth are
you doing?" and I wondered is
that just you or were you
frustrated?
 You know what?
Cirie had it right when she said
she was mad that, that Shane got
voted off.
That was kind of my last ally,
my last grasp.
These guys stayed so strong
throughout the whole show.
I could not crack 'em.
And when it was about to happen,
they noticed it and got, you
know, got rid of who might flop.
But a credit to these guys for
being so strong throughout the
whole game, and yes, it
frustrated me.
It was totally difficult to go
into each challenge as a game
seven.
 PROBST: Yeah, and Aras, you
started this show, I think it
was day one or two where you
had everybody, "Let's all put
our hands together.
Don't stop till you feel the
heat.
You feel the heat?"
And I think Austin was like-- or
Nick-- one of you guys was
saying, "I'm not feeling
anything about this guy."
But I bring that up because
you really did come into this
game, you know, and Shane gave
you a hard time about the yoga
and all that, it's easy to say
that in the heat of the moment.
 Right.
 PROBST: What did you take
away from this experience?
Because you came out here
wanting to learn something about
yourself.
 Yeah, I'm still learning
things about this experience,
but I'd say for sure when I got
home, it felt like a rite of
passage.
Going up against Terry, he's the
ultimate guy, you know, to go up
against him.
To go up against and hold my own
really made me feel like I had
kinda come into my own, so that
was big for me.
 PROBST: Danielle, sitting in
the middle of these two guys,
played a very quiet game, a very
subtle game.
You would disappear and then
reappear, you had a couple, you
had some problems in some of the
late challenges figuring them
out.
I remember watching you getting
frustrated trying to find the
sandbag and all that, then out
of nowhere, when you needed to,
you come up and win the big
challenge.
I know what you said on the show
in terms of why you chose Aras.
I don't buy it.
I don't believe you just...
You got a million dollars on the
line.
You were ready to turn on him
with Terry ten minutes earlier.
What was the real criteria for
making that choice of Aras?
Why did you think you could beat
him and not Terry?
 I just figured because, uh, I
feel that everybody bonded so
much with, everyone took a
liking to Terry towards the end,
and it was a 50-50.
It was risky...
I mean, these are the two most
competitive and smartest...
I think they played the game the
best out of everybody, and I
just figured, um... that either
way, I was taking a shot.
Um, there wasn't one person
that I wanted to...
 PROBST: Do you think you
could have beaten Terry now,
watching the show play out?
 I still think it would have
been tough. I do.
 PROBST: Let's see.
Let's find out.
 I still do. It was tough.
 PROBST: Let's swap.
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want to find this out.
Terry's now in the final two,
Aras, you're now on the jury,
and everybody else who was on
the jury, show of hands for who
would have voted for Danielle.
It takes four.
(murmuring)
 It's, it's...
 PROBST: Okay, you only get
one, Bruce.
So, two votes. It wouldn't h...
Terry would have won.
You were that close to a million
dollars, Terry.
 Thanks, Jeff.
(laughter)
 PROBST: Well, from where you
sit, Danielle, this is what I
want to know.
You guys had such a tight bond.
It was Casaya all the way, and
yet you wouldn't have won even
against Terry.
Do you think that's because it
was a vote out of respect for
Terry or did you lose favor with
people?
 I think I lost some favor
with people.
I think people-- like I said--
towards the end, me, tried not
to vote anybody out.
Aras and I voted the same people
out, so there was some animosity
towards the both of us, so I
figured I had a better shot with
Aras because Terry didn't have
to vote anybody out.
So I took a shot.
 PROBST: All right, before we
take a break, I have one
lighthearted question.
Young kid I met today-- Casey--
nice guy, wants to know, Aras,
how did you keep, who helped you
keep that hair like that for 39
days?
 Let's hear it.
 PROBST: Was it Sally?
 Cirie, actually.
Before every...
 PROBST: I don't want a big
explanation.
I just want to know if you...
 All the girls would help me
before each challenge.
They'd put it up real nice and
high.
 PROBST: All right, up next,
we are gonna talk to Cirie about
her amazing journey.
This is a woman who was afraid
of leaves, ended up catching the
biggest fish and nearly won the
show.
And still to come, one of the
most colorful Survivors ever, we
will hear from Shane.
Plus, you've been voting online
for who you think is most
deserving of winning a 2007
all-new GMC Yukon.
Survivor: Exile Island
Live Reunion Show will be right
back.
 No more torrential downpours,
Sir God!
No more of those!
(lightning crashes)
 I hate leaves.
 I don't think Cirie's had a
lot of outdoor experience.
 This is cool for us to eat
this like this, right?
For the people at home that are
like me-- on the couch-- stay on
the couch.
 PROBST: Touch the mat!
In the bag!
 Look, I got a fish!
 Cirie Fields...
 Whoo-hoo!
 ...caught the biggest fish
out here.
 I kinda underestimated myself
for 35 years.
And now it's like if I really
wanted to do something, there's
nothing that I couldn't do now.
(cheering)
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Exile Island Reunion
Show.
Cirie, when we first met you in
casting, you were a giddy bunch
of nerves, just back and...
"Oh, I can. Oh, I...!"
And there were all kinds of
reasons to not put you on the
show.
And there was one reason that we
put you on and it was your
spirit.
There was something so
compelling about you, that we
thought this is a woman who has
never been off the couch, she
wants to be on this show.
One of the best moves we've
made in putting you on.
It was a delight to watch you.
(cheering)
So what... Cirie...
You got fans everywhere now.
What was it that made you get up
off the couch?
 Oh, Jeff, um...
(laughter)
I don't know.
I just decided to take a chance.
 PROBST: Tell me about the
first day on the beach.
You've taken the chance, and
"Oh, my God, here I am."
 Oh, Lord, the first day, I
hated all my friends and family.
Sorry, guys, but I just couldn't
believe none of 'em said, "Don't
do it.
Are you crazy? You're gonna
die. "
And I'm, like, it was just
horrible.
It was horrible.
You know, I just said to myself,
"Don't embarrass the family.
Don't be the first one.
After the first one goes, you
can go."
 PROBST: Well, that's why you
worked so hard to get Tina off;
just to save your own family
pride.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Well, you talked a
lot about, you know, how much
you've learned from this and how
much time you feel like you've
wasted.
So how has it changed now that
you're back home?
How has it changed your life
there?
 Unbelievable. I'm off the
couch, everybody.
(cheering)
I just feel with the show, um,
America has seen the best and
the worst of me, and the fear of
disappointing people and the
fear of failure is gone now.
 PROBST: That's powerful.
 I mean, after this, I mean,
I can do anything.
(cheering)
 PROBST: Where's your...?
Let's go to your man, your
husband.
HB, stand up.
 HB!
 PROBST: HB, you've gotta
be... Welcome to the show.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 PROBST: You've got to be very
proud of what Cirie did out
there.
 Yes, I am.
 PROBST: And you got to
witness it firsthand.
 Yes, I did. I did.
And, um, everybody's seen the
way they put my butt to work,
so...
You know, I have no problems
with it-- I had to do what I
had to do, so...
 PROBST: What most impressed
you about Cirie when you were
out there and saw how tough it
really is?
 Um, just the fact that she
was taking command, telling
me what to do.
You know, "Honey, get the fire."
Honey, go up there
and get water," you know,
"Honey, we need to do this,
we... scale this fish."
 PROBST: And that impressed
you because you're seeing a side
of Cirie you hadn't seen?
 I'd never seen before.
You know, being out here in
these elements that she does not
like, she don't like to be too
cold or too hot, so for her to
actually be out here...
Sorry, honey. Sorry.
But for her to actually be out
here to do this is awesome.
It's mind-blowing, you know?
And, um, it's a test, you know,
to, to... (sighs)
I can't even speak, Jeff, I'm
just so emotional.
I'm so proud of her and...
 PROBST: Aw!
Well, thanks, HB.
I love you, honey... so much.
 PROBST: All right, HB.
All right, all right.
You guys are a good couple.
Shane, you...
(audience whooping)
 PROBST: Oh, I'm not even
getting to you, yourself.
I want to know-- because you
said something to me when we
were talking about when you
watched the show, you were blown
away by Cirie.
 Oh, yeah. I mean...
You know, she played, by far,
the best social game out there,
a hundred percent.
She, uh, she was dead in the
water, and she was going home
next, or so I thought many times
to my "delusionment," but...
 PROBST: You made a
comment to me about how she is,
sort of typifies the underdog...
 I think the thing that we
can all take from watching and
playing with her is that, um, in
the game, uh, is that she, she
is the Everywoman.
I mean, she is, if you are
like thinking about trying out
for the show and you don't
think this and don't think
that and don't think this...
I mean, Cirie's an inspiration
to everyone in this country who
thinks they can't, and that is
what I'm going to take from my
relationship with Cirie and my
experience with her, because she
absolutely wasn't going further
than day six, and she put her
head down, she worked hard, and
she just got along, and then you
watch her go, "Wow, I could
win," and she orchestrated her
own madness.
And it's really, really
been beautiful to watch.
 PROBST: Somebody else who had
quite an experience this season
was our favorite Bruce, who was
probably in the most physical
pain maybe next to Michael in
our second season, who got
burned in the fire.
Let me-- in case everybody's not
clear on what happened, when you
left, everything was blocked.
Your bowels were blocked, your
bladder was blocked, nothing
was moving and it was a lot
worse than I think anybody knew.
How long were you actually in
pain before you said, "I gotta
see a doctor"?
 Um, about 12 days it started,
12 days before.
And every day it got worse, and
I didn't want to complain to my
tribe.
They kind of knew I was
uncomfortable, but that's why I
sat out of the immunity
challenges, and I always asked,
"Do you need anything done?"
And I'd need to lay down.
 PROBST: And you're okay,
you're completely fine now?
 I'm great. I feel...
(cheers and applause)
I had no idea.
 PROBST: You also took a
machete to the mouth and chipped
a tooth.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: You got a new tooth?
 Yeah, I have a new tooth, and
I had a split, and I just didn't
want to be taken off the show,
and I didn't want my wife to be
mad at me that I got hurt again.
 PROBST: Well, how this works
is if you call for a doctor, if
you're a Survivor and you ask
for the doctor, we will send one
out.
We want to know why you want one
and we're gonna check it out,
and if a doctor does come out
and says, "You've gotta go,"
you gotta go.
So that's the risk you take.
At a certain point, it's out of
your hands.
You didn't have a choice.
Once they came out and he looked
at you, he didn't know what it
was.
Last question I have for you,
by the way, when you came on
this show, you lost your job,
right, as a teacher?
 No, I, uh, I was threatened
that I was going to be
terminated if I didn't show up
the next day, and, um, I just
went anyway, and the whole time
on the show, I didn't know if I
had a job or not, and...
I was suspended...
 PROBST: Always a good thing
for teachers to show their kids.
You were suspended?
 I was suspended with no pay.
 PROBST: Are you back at work?
 I'm back, and I love
teaching-- 34 years, and I love
teaching.
 PROBST: All right.
We have one other thing we're
gonna do, uh, you know...
Terry was another person who I
think was very surprised in
watching Cirie, and you
actually, you guys put
something together...
Just show us what you have
there for Cirie.
 We did... First thing,
there's a couch for sale 'cause
Cirie's never getting back on
it.
Second of all, we joked around
a lot after Cirie caught that
fish, and we said, "Cirie,
you've won the Survivor: Exile
Island First Place Fishing
Tournament."
Cirie Fields.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: All right.
Up next, after smoking three
packs a day, that's 60
cigarettes a day for 20 years,
he waited until day one of
Survivor to quit.
Never had anybody quite like
him.
Shane is next.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Exile Island Reunion
Show.
In the last break, we saw a
sneak peek of the new Adam
Sandler movie Click, which is
about a guy who can rewind his
life with a remote control.
There's certainly times in my
life I'd like to be able to
rewind my life, but I have to
say if there is one person from
this season of Survivor that I'm
glad could not rewind a thing,
it's this guy-- Shane.
Take a look.
 I don't like flea!
I want this one!
I just want mine!
I'm not in a good spot, man.
I got to get through this detox,
for sure, of the cigarette
stuff.
 Shane found a piece of wood
and is actually...
 Send.
 ...calling it his BlackBerry.
 PROBST: Stop eating.
 Don't laugh.
 What?
(Cirie laughs)
 I'm communicating with
people... not on this island.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: All right, let's
start, let's start at the
beginning.
Were you really losing your
mind, or was this a put-on?
 No... (scoffs)
I had smoked three packs a day
my whole life.
I had never tried to quit.
I had no water from like day
two to five-- the doctors say
that's what you need to come of
nicotine the most.
I was losing my mind.
 PROBST: And I don't think
you mind if I share that you've
been through A.A., you've tried
to quit other things before.
How did quitting smoking out
there-- which is what you were
trying to do-- compare to
anything else?
 There's nothing harder.
In the history of my life, there
was nothing as hard as that
first, like, ten days.
Nothing.
Nothing!
 PROBST: What about the
BlackBerry and the thinking
chair, you know all those
things-- was it rubber room
time, or was that you having a
little bit of fun and maybe
playing the social game?
 It definitely wasn't me
playing a social game, 'cause
what would happen is that I
would have the outburst and then
I would, like, sulk off to the
woods and go, "I'm burying
myself as we speak."
This is not the game to play, to
be crazy.
 PROBST: Was there a
point where it became...?
There was a point, where you
started saying, "I'm so
unlikable, everybody's gonna
take me."
Did that actually click with
you at a certain point, where
you said, "You know what?
I'm gonna become the guy
everybody wants to take to the
final two."
 No, I think that right after
the merge-- and I do have to
apologize to Danielle's
boyfriend and her father--
'cause that day 12, I was so
malicious in the, in the...
After that I was like, "Okay, my
only route now is to be like
fair play," you know what I
mean, and just totally freak
everybody out, hate everybody
and just try and roll to the
two.
But what happened is, I
really think people got used to
my outbursts and they would be
like, "That's just... He's just
having his minute."
And I don't know, but I felt
like I was somewhat likeable.
I mean... to the tribe.
 PROBST: In terms of the show,
I remember, we talked at the
beginning, and I would go over,
the producers all go over and
say, "Look, this is gonna be the
hardest thing you ever do," and
Shane was, "You don't know me."
Now that it's all said and
done...
(Shane sighs)
 Can you just... You can stop
right there.
It's... It was the hardest thing
I'd ever done, ever.
I mean, the one thing you don't
realize when you're watching it
on television... 'cause when I
would watch seasons, I would be
like, "Just do it. Just... Why
are you...?"
And you just have no idea how
badly the people were suffering
out here, like and what kind
of depletion they're going
through.
You have no idea unless you've
done it.
 PROBST: One other thing I
gotta ask you about is that
everybody knew that your
relationship with your son
Boston was special to you, and
he got to come out and
experience it, which was nice.
What was his take in watching
the show and all the stuff he
didn't know about Dad losing his
mind?
 Look at him.
First of all, I just want to
say that there's no others like
single mothers, and if it wasn't
for Byrd, I couldn't have made
this journey, and Happy
Mother's Day.
Um...
 PROBST: Byrd is Boston's mom.
Well, your connection was
special and you could tell that
out there.
 Yeah, I mean, me and my son,
when we got home, I just said,
you know, I mean, I'm very vivid
and very outlandish at times,
and very cartoonish, and she
sort of anchors us, but I said,
"This is on a whole 'nother
level, like you have not..."
And we would sit and we would
laugh, and he'd kind of look at
me and go, "Did you just make a
death threat on national
television?"
And I would be like, "I
unfortunately just did that,
yes."
 PROBST: All right, well, as
you say, it is Mother's Day,
and a bit of a transition here.
Because it is Mother's Day, and
this is a day when we celebrate
our moms, but for Tina, one of
this season's Survivors, this
Mother's Day is not a joyful
occasion, and I want to explain.
Tina was originally selected to
be on Survivor: Guatemala.
A few weeks before we were set
to leave, Tina suffered the
worst tragedy any parent could
ever go through.
Her only son, Charlie, was
killed in a car accident.
Obviously she couldn't be on
that season.
We stayed in touch with Tina,
and we said if for any reason
you think at some point this
experience would offer you
something-- therapeutic or
maybe a way to honor Charlie,
we want you to know you have an
open invitation.
And Tina said, "You know what,
I think is it would be good for
my soul.
I would like to give it a try."
You came out, and unfortunately
you were too strong, and they
voted you off soon.
But you touched everybody when
you shared the story of Charlie
and I want to ask you on
Mother's Day, how are you doing
today?
 I'm doing okay.
I'm... I'm doing okay.
I get up every day and hit the
world, just like any other
mother or father should do.
But, I was on a magic carpet
ride, and the rug was pulled
out from underneath me, and
it's not today, it's every day,
and it will be for the rest of
my life, and his father's and
our family and friends, and...
But I was ready to go!
I was ready to go! I...
(applause)
 Bad girl!
 PROBST: Tina, what...
 Bad girl, bad girl!
 PROBST: What's been the
reaction from people?
Have you received mail, or do
people stop you and want to
talk?
 I got a ton of e-mails and
my phone was ringing off the
hook.
Because I'm in show business-- I
have The Lumberjill Show and
The Lumberjack Show in Maine--
people were e-mailing left and
right, they still do.
Because people didn't know
and Charlie has been on the
show with me for, well, 15
years, and, you know, people
that hadn't been to the show
last year and seen us didn't
know until they saw me on
Survivor.
 PROBST: You've gotta share
the story you shared with me.
Tina goes to her e-mail, second
week of the show, you're
watching at home with a friend.
And you get an e-mail and you
say, "Oh here's an e-mail.
This is typical of what I get."
And you start to read it, and
tell us what you read, Tina.
 It was an e-mail from the
people that were in the car
accident with my son.
And, Christine, thank you.
I mean, I've become friends
with her, and it was quite
shocking to me to read that
e-mail, but, you know...
 PROBST: So just so I'm clear,
you're reading along not
knowing who this is from...
 "We watched you on Survivor,
we always watch Survivor, and
we didn't watch it that time and
someone came up to us on the
street and said, 'I think you
need to watch Survivor because
I think the mother of the
child is on there.'"
And it was, like, the
second worst moment of my life
to really realize that other
people were involved, and I
didn't know them yet.
And I wanted to reach out to
them for the longest time, but
then I got whisked off to
Panama and then I got home, and
then you get back to life.
 PROBST: Tina, thank you for
sharing that with us.
And I'm sure you touched a lot
of people.
We're glad you're here.
We're going to take a break.
We'll be right back.
 This is the most miserable
I've ever been in my life.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Exile Island Live
Reunion Show.
I want to try and talk to some
of the other guys.
Austin, I'll start with you.
How tough was Exile Island?
 It was a breeze, man, as
you can tell, it was no problem
at all.
No, seriously, Danielle and I
honestly thought, that we had
been immersed in the second
coming of the Noah floods.
Like I was waiting for God's
audible voice to say, "Hey, man,
go grab snakes and iguanas two
by two because a flood's
coming."
It was awful, but, you know, it
was the best thing that I've
ever been through, too.
You know, Danielle and I sat
there and we cussed and prayed
and cussed and prayed.
And I went out into this game
saying I wanted to represent
somebody bigger than myself, but
I found out what it's like to
lean on somebody bigger than
myself, and when that sun came
up after 48 hours of going
through that maelstrom, I looked
at my life and I took a new
perspective on my faith and I
will always be thankful to the
game of Survivor for that.
It was awesome.
 PROBST: Nice.
Dan, you've been into space, I
mean, you've been into space.
What did you... did you take
anything from this game?
Do you have a memory of this?
 Oh, absolutely, I mean,
waking up every morning in this
unbelievable island, with the
sunrise coming up, and the
iguanas you could pet, the
amazing people that you were
with, away from everything, away
from e-mail, away from phones,
away from it all, it was a
spiritual awakening, and it was
just so beautiful.
And every morning I would get
up, I would say, "Another
beautiful day in paradise."
 He would.
 Ruth Marie sent me a t-shirt,
says, "Another beautiful day in
paradise."
It became a mantra for the
tribe.
 PROBST: Well, it was a
pleasure to have you on the
show.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Courtney, at the
other end of the spectrum, at
times very tough for you.
Was there anything, now that
it's all said and done, anything
positive that came out of this
for you?
 It was a beautiful
reflection really into life and
to how you relate with people.
And that, you know, everyone--
we have our dreams right in
front were us, and that the
result, it's insignificant.
It's really the road you take to
get there and the one you choose
to take on the way out, and
there are many more dreams in
the future, and I grew a lot as
a person.
 PROBST: You know,
considering what you went
through out there, I think it
says a lot about you and
your growth, what you just said.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: Sally, one of the
things that came out on this
show is that right before
coming on the show, you had
gone through a divorce, family
relations were very strained
with your parents because of
that.
Did this show and you being on
TV every week, did that help at
all to bring you guys back
together?
 Um, I think it did, I think
what it did was it gave people
in my life who maybe were
concerned about who I was, who
I had become through some
choices that I had made for my
own life, to give them a glimpse
to be able to say this is who I
am, I'm still the same person.
I'm a lot happier.
And, you know, anyone who
looked at that and really
looked at it would see, so any
other issues out there, they're
not mine, I'm very...
It was a great reflection time
for me.
I'm very affirmed in the choices
that I've made, and where my
life is at. So...
 PROBST: All right, good.
Nick, here's what I want to do,
because we're running a little
bit short on time.
Nick in the back row, except
for Tina who we've talked to, I
want to ask you one thing--
because you guys didn't get a
lot of time necessarily on the
show-- one thing most
misunderstood about you that we
didn't see, quick answer.
 Honestly, not that much.
It was... Nick was hungry.
 PROBST: All right, Nick
was hungry.
Bob Dog, what didn't we know
about you?
 Cirie would disagree with
this, but I'm surprisingly
cuddly.
 PROBST: Ruth Marie.
 Jeff, I think my personality
was way cuter out there than it
showed on the TV.
No offense to the edit, but...
 PROBST: Okay, no cute
personality shown.
Misty, you had bug bites galore.
What else didn't we know?
 But I was still smiling,
so...
 PROBST: You're right.
 Most importantly, and I'm
never gonna give up on anything.
That's me.
 PROBST: Melinda...
 Jeff.
 PROBST: What didn't we get to
see that we would have if you
were out there longer?
 That I could handle whatever
is thrown my way.
Whatever it is, and I know that
now.
That's one thing that I, that I
didn't know before Survivor
that I know now.
I can handle it.
 PROBST: Perfect. Good.
All good answers.
All right, well, during the
show, Terry won a 2007 all-new
GMC Yukon, and in doing so kept
the car curse alive.
12 seasons of Survivor, the
winner of the car has never won
the game.
Tonight we have another GMC to
give away, but this time, your
votes, you at home, have decided
who wins the Yukon.
You've been voting online.
(cheers and applause)
That's right... for your
favorite Survivor.
I want to ask the audience.
Who do you think was voted the
most deserving and the people
who liked them the most?
 Cirie!
 Cirie!
 PROBST: Well...
the woman who told everybody to
get off the couch, is now owning
a 2007 all-new GMC Yukon.
While Cirie figures out what
color Yukon to order, we're
going to take a break.
When we come back, we'll show
you which part of the world
Survivor is heading to next.
Don't go away.
 PROBST: Welcome back.
Tomorrow morning, all four of
our finalists will appear on
The Early Show on CBS.
That's when Aras will receive
his check for a million dollars.
And as this season of Survivor
comes to a close, we're packing
up with a whole new group of
Survivors and heading to one of
the most stunning locations
we've ever been to.
Take a look.
This fall Survivor voyages to
an isolated group of islands
named after the famous English
explorer Captain James Cook.
It was the Cook Islands that
played host to Captain William
Bligh just days before the
infamous mutiny on the Bounty.
Now the new Survivors will have
their own adventures in this
lush and exotic land.
And Exile Island will return
with new twists.
Who will outwit, outplay, and
outlast all the others?
Join us this fall for the
premiere of Survivor: Cook
Islands.
If you want to own a piece of
Survivor: Exile Island, here's
how you can do it.
Immediately following the
reunion show, log on to
You'll find all sorts of
one-of-a-kind props from the
show.
The auction runs from May 14,
that's tonight, to June 11.
The proceeds help Operation
Smile provide free surgery to
children suffering with facial
deformities in Panama and 24
other countries around the
world.
Finally, if you think you have
what it takes to be on this
show, put together a
three-minute videotape.
It doesn't have to be much.
Just turn on the camera and
tell us who you are.
And who knows, like Cirie, it
may just change your life.
We always appreciate your loyal
support.
We hope we see you back for the
next one, Survivor: Cook
Islands.
Good night, everybody.
