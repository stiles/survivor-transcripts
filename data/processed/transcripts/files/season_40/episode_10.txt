Come on in, guys!
All right.
Day 24.
Survivor: Winners at War.
You know, sometimes,
even in a war like this,
it's important to take a moment,
lay down your weapons
and remind yourself what and who
-you are playing for.
-SARAH: What?
-No way.
-SARAH: What?
-DENISE: No, no, no.
This is one of those moments.








-No, no, no, no, no.
-Shut up.
-Shut up.
Kim, here's your husband,
-Bryan...
-SARAH: Oh, my gosh!
-(laughing)
...and your three kids.
-I thought it.
-SARAH: Oh, my God.
Come on out, Bryan.
(whispers):
All right, go. Go, go, go, go.
-No way.
-(laughing)
-Oh, my... (crying)
KIM:
Guys!
It's me! Come on!
Oh, you're so big.
Are you guys feeling shy?
Hug? Yeah.
(crying)








Hi, babe.
(crying):
Oh, my God.
(crying)
-SOPHIE: Aw. (crying)
-(whispers): Hey, kid.
SARAH:
Oh, my gosh.
This is unbelievable.
I just miss you guys so much.
It's so good to see--
You guys can't know
how much I'm happy to see you.
I think about you all day,
every day.
-(shudders)
-(chuckling)
-(sniffling)
-KIM: Hi, baby.
So, Kim,
-this is
a really unusual moment.
-(laughs)
Oh, yeah.
To see firsthand why you left,
-who you're playing for--
this is it.
-(chuckling)
This is the family.
This is the best moment.
This is way sooner
than any of us
were expecting it.
And so to know
that these guys are here
and to see
their actual little faces,
not in my mind but in person,
and for them to know
that I'm well
and that I'm coming home soon,
I'm sure they've been wondering
where I've been for so long.
-(exhales)
-It's just everything.
I don't know.
It's one of the best moments
of my life.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Well, you're all together
right now.
-Have a seat over here, Kim.
-Oh, my gosh.
-You go with them.
-You sure are.
-I can't believe
you guys are here.
-(chuckling)
PROBST:
Let's get to some more love.
-Ben, here's your wife Kelly
and your kids.
-Yes, sir.
-(chuckles)
-(applause)
-SARAH: Aw.
-Yes!
Surprise!
-Surprise!
-(laughter)
-Come here.
-(giggling)
(crying, sniffling)
BEN:
You guys look so good. Oh, wow.
(quietly):
I love you.
(crying)
-Hey, my guy.
-(sniffles)
-So, Ben.
-Yes, sir.
We remember the last time
you played.
You were so open
about how Kelly had,
as you said, saved your life.
-Yes, sir.
-So to be back here now again
and to have
the complete unit here,
what is this moment for you?
It's-it's the full circle, Jeff.
Now everybody gets to see
my two beautiful kids
and my beautiful wife
and the reason
why I'm here on this earth,
you know,
and why I strive so hard
to be a good man
and a good husband
and a good father.
It's 'cause of-of these three
right here, you know?
(sniffles)
And the opportunity that you
and Survivor have given us
and the platform
to help others and--
I'm so glad that the decisions
I've made in life
-have gotten me to this point.
-Mm. Wow.
-Beautiful. Join Kim's family.
-(chuckles)
Find a spot.
Sophie, you burst into tears
when you realized
it was a loved one.
Who do you want to see?
(crying)
My fiancé.
All right, Bobby, come on out!
(chuckling)
-SARAH: Aw!
-(Nick chuckles)
(crying)
PROBST:
That's a hug.
(Nick chuckles)
(crying)
PROBST:
A game this tough,
nothing feels better
than a trusting hug.
(crying)
You smell so good.
PROBST:
Sophie, talk to me
about this guy.
What is it about Bobby?
Bobby is just, like,
the most loving,
open, caring person.
And I don't think
I got it for a while,
that Bobby is
the most trusting person.
And to have somebody coming
right now, at a time when,
like, I feel like
even the people I like out here
I don't know
what to make of them,
there's, like, only one person
in this whole world
who wants to marry me,
-and I wish he was
on the beach with me.
-(chuckles)
-He is now.
-Yeah.
All right, head over.
Join the other loved ones.
-Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
a hamburger...
-Uh-huh.
-...a massage.
-All right, Sarah,
-you ready for some love?

Here's your partner Wyatt
and your son.
(Sarah crying)
DENISE:
Oh, he's so cute.
There's Mommy.
♪ ♪
-(Sarah crying)
-So proud of you.
-(crying)
-SARAH: I can hold you.
It's okay.
(Sarah whispering)
PROBST:
Sarah, does it get any better
than that right there?
No.
(sniffles)
Sarah, talk to me
from a mom's point of view.
How hard is it
to leave such a little one,
knowing he's in good hands
but you're gonna miss out?
Um, you know... it's so hard.
And Wyatt went through this
once.
And, you know,
when people out here ask me
my favorite thing about Wyatt,
it's that he loves me
no matter what.
He sees me at my best
and my worst,
and I have
his unconditional love.
And I-I'm just
so thankful for that.
(sniffling)
All right, take a spot over
there with the other families.
Come here, buddy.
PROBST:
She doesn't want
to give him up, Wyatt.
-(chuckling)
-Hi.
-SARAH (whispers): Sit up here.
-Denise, you ready?
-(chuckling)
-Here's your husband Brad
and your daughter.
My peeps. Oh, my peeps.
-Love my peeps.
-They need some love.
(crying)
PROBST:
Wow.
That is a family hug.
(chuckles)
Look at you.
Oh, my God, you look so good.
You look so clean. Beautiful.
-Oh, my God.
-(chuckling)
So, Denise, you're in
this unusual situation
where you have a daughter
who's now a young woman,
-so she doesn't need you
to take care of her.
-Yeah.
-(exhales)
-But she's still your child.
What is this moment about?
-She may be 15 and a half,
-(chuckles)
almost 16,
but we need each other
as much as we did day one.
-I need this guy
as much as I did day one.
-(sniffles)
There are a lot of parents
very hopeful right now
when they hear your mom
say that,
as a 16-year-old,
you still need your parents.
-Hell yeah.
-Definitely.
-What is this like for you
to be out here and see your mom
in such a different environment?
It's just been hard, 'cause
she's, like, my best friend.
I tell her everything.
And so knowing
that she's out here
and I can't, like,
see how she's doing,
it's just really hard.
(sniffles)
-Text me. Just text me,
and I'll get it later.
-(chuckles)
All right,
join the other loved ones.
(sniffles) Oh, my.
Nick, let's get
your fiancée out here.
-Yes.
-(chuckling)
Grisel, get out here.
(gasps)
(laughing)
Hey.
(chuckling)
-Oh, my gosh.
-(chuckles)
-Really?
-Yes.
You do.
(chuckles)
-So do you.
-Thank you.
-(chuckles) Oh, my God.
-(chuckles)
-You're doing awesome.
-Nick, talk to me
about the moments
when you're out here
on the beach...
-Mm.
-...and you think about
the people that you care about,
how did that impact you
going home?
At home, everything's so fast--
work and school.
Your phone's always buzzing.
And it's hard
to sometimes put all that away
and see what's right
in front of you.
And out here, that happens.
And I thought, "This is
the woman I want
to spend the rest of my life."
And I never wanted
to take it for granted again.
It's like--
It was so much clarity,
and I just never wanted it
to get blurred again.
All right,
join the other loved ones.
-Let's go. Here, at the top.
-The families growing
over there.
But we're not done.
Tony, let's get your wife
out here.
Come on, Marissa!
Bring the kids.

(crying):
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

(crying):
Oh, my goodness.
(crying)
Don't cry, baby.
(kisses)
Let me see you.
Oh, my God.
(crying)
This-this is-- this is not
a dream come true, man.
-It's a fantasy come true.
-Mm.
I fantasize about this, man.
Tony, tell me about the part of
you that we don't see out here,
-which is this guy, the dad.
-Oh.
No, I'm-I'm sure-- We--
All these families you see here
and the ones we're about to see,
that's what made us all bond.
That's what made us be strong
throughout this game, man--
these guys right here.
You know? And my wife
never got a chance
to come out, man.
My first season, the loved ones,
she couldn't make it 'cause,
this little babushka here,
she was in her little swaddle.
And then, for the finale,
she couldn't come see me
in the finale
'cause this little guy
was in her tummy.
-(chuckles)
-And here we are today, man.
It finally all worked out.
They're here now, man, Jeff.
This is so real, man.
Go join
all the other loved ones.
Thank you so much, Jeff.
Don't cry, my little baby cake.
-All right, Michele,
let's get your sister out here.
-(chuckles)
Kim, come on out.
-(both laughing)
-Hey!
(chuckles):
Hey.
-How are you?
-Hey, girlfriend.
(chuckling, crying)
So proud of you.
You smell good.
(sniffs)
You smell good.
-(laughs)
-I'm so proud of you.
Michele, the sister bond,
even though,
when you're little,
sometimes it can be tough.
When you grow up
and become women,
it's so often
such a powerful bond,
-and I see that in you guys.
-(chuckling)
What is it about your sister,
Michele,
that connects you so much?
Well, we're a year
and a week apart,
-so we are like twins.
-(sniffles)
-She's my roommate, she's
my best friend, she's my sister.
-Wow.
She's everything. She's
the best human that I know.
And they have
their soul mates here,
and this is my soul mate.
And I just, like, feel good.
It reminds me that
I'm supposed to be out here.
And she says
that she's proud of me, and...
it makes me proud of me,
to hear her say that,
-'cause I lose track sometimes.
-(sniffles)
Mm-hmm. All right,
join the other loved ones.
-Glad you're here, Kim.
-Oh, my God. I missed you.
All right, Tyson.
Let's get Rachel out here,
along with one of your kids.
Come here.
-Come here.
-(others aahing)
-Oh!
-KIM: Oh, she's so beautiful.
-Oh.

PROBST:
Come on out, Rach.
(crying)
Oh.
-I love you, too.
-Love you.
Be strong.
How are you?
(chuckles)
-Have you been good for Mommy?
-Who is that?
Do you remember me
or did you already forget?
PROBST:
Come on, Rachel.
-TYSON: Come right here.
-You're in this.
I lo-- I love watching this.
-Really?
-Yes.
-(exhales)
-Tyson,
last time you played,
you played with Rachel.
You want to go to Mom?
You hadn't made a baby.
And now here you are again,
sort of a full circle moment,
where you have
almost your entire family here
with you.
I've dreamed about
this moment for
a long, long time.
'Cause I've never experienced
a family visit
in the four times I've played.
And... I--
One of my motivations
for coming out here this time
was to share it with Bergen,
so that she could see
what Daddy does.
This is what I do.
I run around in an island on--
-in my underwear. This is my...
-(laughs)
-This is my work uniform.
-Look at him.
-(chuckles)
-TYSON: Do I look the same?
Am I stinky?
-I am?
-(chuckling)
We only shower in the ocean.
That's my bathtub and my toilet.
(chuckles)
All right,
join the other loved ones.
Sit right there.
(crying)
Jeremy, you're ready.
Let's do it.
Val, come on out!
Let's go!
-Bring the Collins group.
-Let's go!
-(crying) Oh, God.
-(Probst chuckles)
(crying)
PROBST:
Wow.
-(crying)
-You can do it, Daddy.
-You can do it, Daddy.
-(crying)
(talking quietly)
Jeremy,
last time you were out here,
Val came out
for the loved one visit
and she whispered
in your ear what?
She's like, "The baby's fine,
and he's a boy."
-And that's my guy, Remy.
-(chuckles)
(kisses)
And since then, Val,
you guys have had another child.
-Yep. This is Lenyx.
-(exhales)
Add him to the Foxborough tribe.
And your two daughters.
And Jordyn and Cam, yeah.
So, Jeremy, if you had a diary
and you were gonna write down
what this moment is about,
what would you write?
I miss 'em so much.
I think about 'em every day.
I dream about 'em.
(kisses, sniffles)
And I-- This is what I need.
This is--
-this is the reason why
I almost didn't play.
-Mm.
And this is the reason
why I'm playing.
Like, I feel like I'm missing
so much, you know?
And, uh...
and I needed this, Jeff.
We're glad you guys
are all out here.
All right, Jeremy,
go join the other loved ones.
-Thanks, Jeff.
-Are you happy, Dada?
(indistinct chatter)
This is a beautiful
Survivor moment.
This is better than we hoped,
hearing all of you guys talking
and hugging
and loving each other.
And I just want
to thank Fiji Airways.
They made this possible.
They flew all of
-the loved ones out here
to Fiji...
-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

once-in-a-lifetime Survivor
family bonding experience.

immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge,
you're gonna pull on a rope,
balancing a wobbly table,

to stack letter blocks
one at a time.

For immunity
and two fire tokens.
Survivors, ready?
Go!
First thing,
you're simply looking
for that letter.
It's gonna be on the bottom.
Place it
and then start coming back.
Now's where you got to balance
the table.
There's a learning curve
to that slack.
How much play can you give it
before a block drops?

on their first letter.
Michele did this challenge
in Cambodia.
It lasted over an hour.
Sarah did this challenge

He's got to get all the way out,

Ben reaching for that eighth.
And he's got it.
Ben has to pick up his pace.

-Tony places
his eighth and final letter.
Still has to get

without dropping.
This would be his first
individual immunity win
in his Survivor career.

for Tony to drop,
or he's got to try to catch him
right here and go for broke.
Ben moving quickly.
He's starting
to close the gap now.
Tony dead still now.
Ben loses everything.

Like the fog is settling
on the battlefield.
There's gonna be a lot
of close fire
zinging by our heads,

Tonight, there will be blood.

Good job, Tony.

-SARAH: Nice job, Tony.
Congrats.
-DENISE: Man, that's so awesome.
-TONY: Thank you so much, man.
-This is an amazing feeling.
-KIM: Good job, you.
-Good job.
TONY: This is the first time
in three seasons I get to wear
the bulletproof vest right here.
I have it.
To win it on a game
that requires patience,
that's not my style of game.
Slow and steady is not
what I'm made of.
I'm made out of fast and sloppy.
-Wow, man. That's beautiful.
-JEREMY: There you go.
(kisses)
TONY:
I am so happy.
This is more powerful
than any hidden immunity idol.
And when you have the power,
people come to you.
So, what-what are
your thoughts, man?
(water burbling, splashing)
-JEREMY: I know he would.
-TONY: Just wait.
I mean, we still have a lot of
people to talk to, so let's see.
JEREMY:
It's getting down
to the nitty-gritty,
and more than anything,
I would love to break up
Sarah and Sophie.
They're too close,
and that's dangerous
for people like me
who's by himself,
basically, you know?
But Tony's like,
"We can't do that."
And it's frustrating.
I don't get a voice,
and that's not
how it should be.
SARAH:
Okay. So, here's the thing.
We just need to make her
feel comfortable...
-No. Why...
-...that it's Denise or someone
and ... vote her out.
-TONY: I'd rather see Tyson go.
-SARAH: No, dude.
-Kim is way more dangerous.
-TONY: This is what...
This is what I would like to do.
-Just listen. Let's go.
-Okay. I am. I am.
-You're getting frustrated.
You got to listen.
-No, I-I know.
We don't have a lot of time.
-We have a lot of time.
-Okay. Okay.
SARAH:
I want to vote out Kim.
Kim is gonna win this game
if we don't vote her out.
But talking to Tony right now
is like talking to a rock.
Kim has everybody
in her back pocket.
She can win immunity.
She was right up there today.
She doesn't have everybody
in her back pocket.
-All right. All right.
-No. No. Listen.
-That's just what
I'm telling you.
-I know.
-You don't have to agree.
-I know.
-Why are you acting
like that, man?
-What do you mean,
-acting like that?
-You're getting frustrated
with me.
-Just chill.
-I'm not, Tony. I'm just saying,
-this is a crucial decision.
-Yeah.
SARAH:
He's not even listening
to what I'm saying.
He tells me
stop freaking out at him,
but then he freaks out at me,
and it's just a mess.
And it's like, geez Louise,
how can we even work together?
This is going to end badly
if we can't get this
straightened out.
I personally feel like
Kim's the right vote out.
We just need

BEN:
Okay.
TONY:
There's something fishy
about Jeremy.
He's sneaky. I don't trust him.
Every time
we tell him something, he wants
to go against the grain.
He would even vote Sarah out
if he could,
so he's got to go.
KIM:
Okay.
We need to talk and spread
this thing around.
-Yes.
-I think so, too.
Because I feel like we...
us three need to stick together.
That's the guy
I need to talk to.
KIM:
It's just chaos at camp.
There's lots of conversations
going on,
and we're not a part of it.
So I need to start getting
a different plan.
Look, here's the deal.
I don't think
I have any friends out here.
-You don't have
any friends out here.
-I know.
You don't have
any friends out here.
-I'm sure you know that.

I'm gonna play with you guys

-Okay.
TYSON:
Us three,
-Denise and Michele.
-KIM: Okay.
You know what?
-Do you have one?
-Yes.
TYSON:
I am worried that it could be
me going back
to the Edge tonight.
I've already been
voted out once.
But Kim has an idol,
and if we play it right,
maybe I can save myself
for at least one more vote.
KIM:
I'm ready to go to the Edge
trying to make a move.
Well, you're not going down
'cause you have an idol.
-Okay.
-I'm not playing it for myself

I have my safety

I don't get a vote,

But now my alliance needs me

What are you gonna do?
I don't know yet.
If I did leave,
I would be turning my back

I would prefer if she just
played it tonight to be safe,

PROBST:
Nick, let's get right into it.
How are you feeling
about this game?
Because last Tribal,
you were very vocal in saying,
"This is the most pathetic war
I've ever seen."
Yeah, I was frustrated.
The two biggest allies
I had in the game
were Yul and Wendell,
and they went out back-to-back.
But it feels like
we're playing Survivor now,
so that's good, in my opinion.

is what triggers that.
It just seems to just
spontaneously happen.
You know, because you can't ever
really know what's going on.

you feel really paranoid,
you know?
So it's kind of
a Survivor insanity.
That's a good word for it,
"insanity."

-PROBST: And, Jeremy,
everybody here is a player,
and so it's impossible
to manage a game like
each of you did
when you won your season.
Yeah, this is a lot different
