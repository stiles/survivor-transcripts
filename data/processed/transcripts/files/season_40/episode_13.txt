MICHELE:
Tribal Council was a disaster,
as usual.
I think the votes
are all going to Jeremy,
so I gave Jeremy
the 50/50 advantage,
and he decided to not play it.
-Want to chat? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Let me put this down.
MICHELE:
But I guess this Tribal Council
ended with a positive outcome
because Jeremy is still here.
On the flip side...








-All right.
-...people know
that I was willing
to play my advantage for him,
so now everybody knows
about my advantage.
I feel like...
that was a ... cluster ...,
-"A."
-It was, it was.
MICHELE:
I've been wanting to play
this really aggressive game,
but I sort of feel like I took
a butter knife to a gunfight,
and I don't really know
how I can recover.
Every single person,
including Tony,
came up to me today,
saying that it was you.
(laughs):
Oh, my God.
JEREMY:
This is Groundhog Day
for me here.
Three Tribals in a row that
everybody is coming after me.








I-I wish I knew why
I was so popular around here.
I genuinely am like,
"Why would they not tell me
to not vote for you?"
Because I obviously
would've jumped on board
-to not vote for you.
-I don't know. I don't know.
-I'm gonna give you this back.
-Okay.
JEREMY: But I have
a connection with Michele,
and Michele gave me that 50/50
coin to play if I needed it.
But I give that 50/50
back to Michele.
I want nothing to do with that.
My game is not coming down
to a 50/50 coin flip.
-What could I have done?
-No, no, you're fine.
You're fine,
you're fine, you're fine.
So, who do we trust?
-No one.
-Nobody.
This is the penultimate step
of the war.

we take off, and...
it's gonna get

that much last night.
-Oh, you didn't sleep?
-Oh, I'm being sarcastic.
-JEREMY (laughs): Oh. Oh. Oh.
-No.
-SARAH: Oh. You didn't?
DENISE:
Last night at Tribal Council,
I just said to Jeff,
like, "I'm done."
But when I say I'm done,
it's not
I'm done with the game--
it's I'm done with dealing
with things the way
that I've been dealing
and getting myself as upset as
I have been about the process.
What are you gonna write

Mm, I got a,
I got a little plan.

DENISE:
I'm not a tattoo gal.
I don't have any tattoos.
Probably never will.
But then I was laying
in the shelter last night,
and I thought,
"No, I need two tattoos."
I need the one on the left hand
that says, "Endure,"
to remind me I can.
I'm capable of staying out here
for another nine days.
But then I also know
that it's okay to let go.
Like, "endure" and "let go"
and know that both of those
are totally okay.
-A lot of work in front of us.
-I know.
-Yo, we got to get here.
-Well...
(Tony scoffs)
All I got is about
a week left, yo.
-Two.
-That's it.
Two? Two what?
-Two weeks.
-Uh, how is that two weeks?
-You...
-Nine days, bro.
Five days of working.
-Working week.
-Yo, that's not two weeks, man.
This isn't a work week.
That's why police officers
need to go back to school.
-Why?

nine days is two weeks.
-Ten days is two weeks.
-14 days is two weeks.
No. I work five days a week.

You're still working

TONY:
This thing, right,
with Jeremy--
he's a fireman.
I'm a police officer.
We're always feuding, and-and
we have a little rivalry going.
It's for fun over here
on Survivor.
But I know
Jeremy is a number for me.
I know he trusts me.
So, right now, my plan is
to try to keep Jeremy around.
Because if Jeremy goes home,
the hyenas are gonna come out
in a full pack
and start attacking us.
Strategically, what do you think
is the right move next?
If we get rid of Jeremy,
then the other...
-hyenas pull together...
-And they decide, yeah. Mm-hmm.
-...then it's gonna be
problematic.
-It's not gonna be fair.
This part of the game is tricky.
Cops-R-Us, man.
We got to stick together.
We're trying.
You know, how many years has
it been since we first formed?
-Six.
-Six years?
I said-- That's why I said,
"Six years in the making."
TONY:
So, Sarah and I,
we've played this game.
Six years ago, we formed
an alliance, Cops-R-Us,
and I burned her.
-And this was the plan
in the first...
-I know.
Right. And I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
It took six years
to get to that.
-It's crazy.
-Three seasons.
This is a tiebreaker, Sarah.
Oh, my God.
Cops-R-Us.
Let's see who...
-(chuckles)
-I'm gonna have
to blindside you, man.
(laughs)
Try it.
-Try it. (chuckles)
-No, stop.
TONY:
Now I got to know Sarah,
and we said,
"Let's just stick together
and just keep this Cops-R-Us
going all the way to the end."
And we've been doing good
so far.
I mean,
that's our plan right now,
is to take Cops-R-Us
all the way to the end.
So, this is what's scary, is,
-okay, Ben hates Jeremy.
-I know that.
-That's a problem.
-Yeah.
We take out Jeremy,
and we're sitting ducks.
And-and Ben
won't not take him out.
Mm-hmm.
SARAH:
Ben, Sarah, Tony.
We're in a lock solid
final three.
Period. No ifs,
ands, buts about it.
Here's our problem
that we're running into is
Ben wants Jeremy gone.
But if we got rid of Jeremy,
Tony and I are sitting ducks.
Nick's with us, but he doesn't
want to go to the end with us.
I know that. I know that.
SARAH:
So, at this point,
getting rid of Nick
would be the smarter option
for my game.
But what's smart for my game
is not the smartest for Ben's.
And, at this point,
Ben's pretty stubborn,
and he's not gonna budge.
So I figured I would have
my work cut out for me
this afternoon,
to have to try to convince Ben
to get rid of Nick.
Jeremy is
actually Tony's number.
-Right.
-When we're thinking about it--
no emotions,
if it's just written on paper...
-Yeah.
-...Jeremy is Tony's number.
-Yeah.
-Jeremy wants to work
with you and me also.
-Right.
-And I believe that.
And so we need to take out
people who are not our numbers.
-I know.
-And, uh-- But-but I told you
that I-I would let you make
that decision.
If you want Jeremy gone,
I will write Jeremy's name down.
If Ben never gets
a turn at driving,
Ben's not gonna go
to the end with me.
So if we make Ben believe
that this is his decision,
then everything's good.
But this is just a ploy
so we can vote Nick out.
The only person
who's not our number is Michele
and then Nick.
So, what if we just
blindside Nick?
Uh, that's up to you, bro.
-I-I got your...
-And we have Denise.
Are you okay to work with Jeremy
more than you are
-with Nick at this point?
-One more round, I could.
As long as it's me,
you and Sarah.
BEN:
Jeremy is more beneficial
for my game at this point.
So there's this thought
of keeping
Jeremy, Tony and Sarah.
With seven people left,
keeping them around
is a shield for me.
They're bigger threats.
Nick's not gonna want to go to
the end with me, you and Sarah.
-Yeah, he wants
to go with Michele and...
-Yeah.
BEN:
Where Nick, on the other hand,
he's walking around frantic.
He's trying to play both side,
and he's not doing
a very good job,
'cause everybody's seeing it.
I trust Denise more
than I trust Nick.
And Denise,
she's lockstep with me,
and she'll vote any way
that we want to vote.
If you wanted to get rid
of Nick, you just let me--
Whatever you want, you
let me know. We talk about it.
-We say, "Okay..."
-I just don't know
if he's fully with us, dude.
-I don't think he is.
-BEN: This right now,
in this war,
is the hardest mission yet.
The reason why is because
it's gonna be a huge blindside.
I'm scared that Michele will
play her advantage for Jeremy.
Plus, there's a 50/50 immunity
that we have to flush
and do this correctly.
At this point in the game,
if this goes screwed up,
our squad
and this mission is blown out.

As of right now, I say Denise.

I mean, yeah.
BEN:
So, it would be easy

However, Denise is my friend

And I've been debating
on whether or not
to push Jeremy to go
or whether or not to keep him.
It takes one of the shields out
for me, but,
in the same breath, it
breaks up Michele and Jeremy.
So, at this point,
I'm trying to create
a little distrust
between Jeremy and Michele

we know where

I don't want a 50/50 to ... us.
Unless you can get the 50/50, J.

Denise was the one

"Watch, Jeremy's sketchy.
-He's gonna ask you
for the 50/50."
-See that?
MICHELE:
Ben is saying,
"Keep an eye out for Jeremy.
He's gonna ask you
for your advantage."
And then Ben is going to Jeremy
and saying,
"Ask Michele for her advantage
and see if she'll give it
to you."
So he's playing both sides.
Listen, we got to get Nick,
-and we got to get Tony.
-Tony.
-Get Ben?
-Yes.

Ben going-- that's great for me.
And Jeremy going--

a worst-case scenario,

so why not go after him?
Yo, listen, me, you, Michele
-and Nick.

been clashing for a while now.
Right now,
are you 100% Ben or Denise?
-I'm Ben. Ben.
-That's it?
-You?
-Okay. Yeah, I'll do it.
That's it, then.
So, he wants Ben out of
the game for his best interest.
That's not my best interest.
Not for the cop.
I really don't want to get rid
of Jeremy, but, at this point,
Sarah and I think
that our best thing to do
would be to stay strong
with Ben.
So, listen, Jeremy thinks
he's super tight with me, right?
Us four are supposed to go--
you, me, Jeremy, Michele
and-and Nick,
-right-- we're supposed
to get you out.
-It was Jeremy's plan.

Yeah, just now. All right?
But the truth is it's me,
you, Nick voting Jeremy.
You, you vote Michele.
Them two are voting Ben.
It's over. Three.
Okay.
So, we're gonna split the votes
between Michele and Jeremy.
So, the guys-- me, Nick
and Ben-- we're voting Jeremy.
Denise and Sarah,
they're voting Michele.
And then Michele
can play her advantage
that she has, a 50/50.
And whether
it's "safe" or "not safe,"
our real votes tonight
are going to Jeremy.
SARAH:
For sure? Okay.
Just saying,
what if this happened?
If Nick went with Jeremy,
Michele,
and they put three votes on Ben,
-he could've just flipped it
and takes Ben out.
-Yeah.
-Do you think
he's gonna do that?
-No.
SARAH:
Right now, the plan
is to vote out Jeremy.
But I also
don't fully trust Nick.
He's a hard one to read.
I think Nick definitely wants
to build a résumé for himself.
And I guess
tonight's gonna tell
whether he's with us
or if he's against us.
As long as we're all together, I
don't really care what they do.

PROBST:
All right, let's start with
today's immunity challenge.
Michele, you struggled.
A lot. That happens.
Sometimes people struggle.
But what's unique
about struggling on a show
like Survivor
is that everybody is watching.
And is that part of it,
the vulnerability
of being exposed?
Thanks for pointing it out,
that now
everybody is gonna be watching
at home. (chuckles)
But I try not to think
about what other people
are gonna perceive,
and I just try to focus
on where my headspace is at.
Ben, you're always
being watched.
You're being watched
by the other players.
You're being watched by me.
Now you're being watched
by the jury.
Does it become
a little schizophrenic,
trying to remember
which persona
to use in this moment
to this person or this group?
I think it's hard
to be someone you're not
when you're not eating,
when you're emotional
after vote-outs,
physically drained
from challenges.
You're mentally, physically
and emotionally just broke.
And that's where the truth
comes out.
Sarah, you've talked a lot
about being a police officer.
Police officer
has similar situations,
in which you have to walk
into something cold
and decide who you're going
to be in that moment
to try to defuse a situation.
SARAH:
There cannot be hesitation
when we go on a call.
You have to go in and you have
to be confident in your answers.
You have to be confident
in the way that you speak.
And when I played
the game before,
I definitely relied on that.
This season, it's different.
When you play with people you
know and you really care about,
you don't want to be a jerk.
Nick, Sarah's really talking
about "it's personal."
But can you win this season
by saying,
"Not personal to me"?
I think you can probably win
this season like that.
But I feel like, this season,
people are more truthful.
I guess the question is:
Does that leave the door open
for somebody
to play like a first season
and do whatever they got to do
to make it to the end?
I'm not sure. It-It's tough.
Jeremy, you play the first time
with your wife.
You play the second time,
your wife comes out
and tells you about a new baby
that's coming.
You play the third time,
your entire family's here.
How can this game be anything
but personal?
I mean,
th-this game is personal.
But I think you have to find
a middle ground.
I don't think
you can use everybody as robots.
And you can't play
totally with your heart.
You have to find some type
of sweet spot there.
PROBST:
So, Ben, you're trying
to thread that needle,
which says,
"I do respect you
and I do like you
and I'm probably going
to betray you at some point."
(chuckles):
Yeah.
It's an emotional
and tactical crossroad.
I mean, we've all heard
each other's stories.
We've talked about our children
and what are we gonna do
to better ourselves
as-as humans
when we get back home, right?
And so trying to focus
on the personal side
but realize that
we're still in a tactical war
-is the hard part.
-Michele,
this all sounds genuine,
that there's respect
and friendships.
And yet there's still lies.
When the game is over,
what does that do
to your ability
to trust just in the world?
Yeah, it's hard.
I remember getting home
from my last season
and having my guard
all the way up,
double-checking
and triple-checking people,
and, like,
they were just telling you
that you should turn right up on
this corner to get to the bar.
PROBST:
Ben, I noticed you nodding
while she was talking.
I remember coming back
from my first season
and having, like,
trust issues with my wife and...
The person who you had credited
with saving your life.
Absolutely. That's why
I just want to come in here
and be able to trust people.
You know? I'm not gonna let
the game change who I am.
I'm not gonna let the money
change who I am.
I'm gonna leave here
a better man,
regardless of what happens.
How 'bout you, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
I remember, Cambodia,
I went home and I wasn't right
for three months.
-Wow.
-And I remember going
to the fire station,
talking to the guys
that I trust with my life,
and I didn't believe
some of the things they said.
So, this time,
I want to have more fun with it,
and I don't want it
to get in my head.
PROBST:
Nick, you're the most recent
winner that's out here.
What was your experience like
when you went back home,
in regards to trusting people?
It was hard for me
to come back so quickly.
I mean,
it does take a toll on us.
You know, people talk about
numbers, strategy.
And it's not a strategic game.
It's a social strategic game.
Like, we're not blocks of wood.
We're not chess pieces
to be moved around.
And I feel like, this season,
there is more emphasis
on the social relationships.
PROBST:
So, Tony,
we now have this foundation
that we all understand.
And yet there are seven of you.
There's about to be six.
TONY:
Yeah, at this point
of the game, we know
which soldiers we're gonna
march forward with in this war.
We're locked and loaded,
and we're just ready
to march forward.
PROBST:
Jeremy, that sounds like
there's a group
that thinks they've got
something going.
JEREMY:
Um, I think everyone has
their idea of a group, yeah.
Their idea?
Their idea of a group, yeah.
PROBST:
Sarah, you agree with that?
I mean, three Tribals ago,
we thought
this group was with this group
was with this group.
The Tribal after that,
it was a different group
with a different group.
And then,
after last Tribal Council,
there's at least one advantage
that's pretty out in the open.
Which one is that?
Um, the one that Michele has,
which is the 50/50.
You flip a coin, you're either
safe or you're not safe.
PROBST:
So, Michele, were you
a popular person today
with this 50/50 coin?
(chuckles) I don't know.
I gave it to Jeremy
last Tribal Council.
It created a little bit of fear.
I have it. It's the last day
that I can use it.
I expect it to be
played tonight.
PROBST:
Wow. Tony, cryptic answer.
"I expect it to be
played tonight."
I would play it tonight if I had
something that I have to play,
whether I needed it or not.
But tonight, we're gonna make
the bed that we want to lay in
for the rest of the game.
Denise, do you have
a pretty solid idea
of what you would like
to see happen?
I-I would like to not feel like
I'm walking down the end
of the gangplank.
I have an idea and a hope of
what I would like to work out,
whether or not
that'll happen tonight.
Again, without the necklace,
as I was reminded
last Tribal Council,
we're not safe.
So, just want to make sure
I have this straight.
The 50/50 coin
is out in the open.
There's no chaos.
Everybody seems
very calm right now.
So, Jeremy, are you optimistic
or pessimistic that the vote's
gonna go your way?
I mean, I don't know about
everybody else,
but every time I see your face
here, Jeff, I'm nervous.
-Except when I have this on.

Tribal was intense.
It came down to Jeremy or I,

an old Western, right,

standing on the street,

pulled them yet, right?

the draw went and it feels
fantastic that
I finally got him out.

TONY:
Tribal worked out
exactly as planned.
This whole entire game,
I've been on the right side
of the votes.
This whole entire game.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, but...
TONY:
And then you have Michele
that's always been
outside every vote.
She has no idea
what's going on in the game.
In other seasons,
you would call that a goat
and you would want to go
to the end with them.
Not on the Super Bowl season
of Survivor.
You don't, you don't
want that around.
The only scary part is Nick
keeps winning those challenges
-with the puzzles, man.
-I know. I know.
I know. Yeah, I agree.
But I think Michele
needs to go before Nick.
-Oh, 100%.
-Yeah, yeah.
TONY:
She's a hyena in the game.
And you know what?
Time for you to go home.
-NICK: You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.
I was wondering
if you'd have the balls
to come down and talk to me.
-Of course I want
to talk to you.
-Mm-hmm.
Honestly, I mean...
you know we can't beat Jeremy.
I know we can't beat Jeremy.
But I'm genuinely curious
what you think
our path to the end
is from here.
NICK: I think
I made the right decision,
because the vote for me is about
building allies moving forward.
Michele-- she wanted
to work with Jeremy.
I have no interest
in working with Jeremy at all.
And she keeps wanting to go
a different direction
than I want to go.
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm public enemy number one,
and you're right after me.
We are on the bottom
of the pecking order.
NICK:
Now that Jeremy's gone,
ideally, I would love to
get Ben out of here.
Ben is hotheaded, emotional.
He's, like,
an impulsive player.
So...
I definitely feel like
playing with Ben
is like playing with fireworks
or a stick of dynamite.
And I just don't want it
to blow up in my own hands.
There's no path
to the end for us.
Literally none.
Do you think Sarah will
flip on Tony or Ben? No.
-No. But-but they want...
-Do you think Denise will
flip on Ben? No.
Me and Nick are on the bottom,
and Nick is too naive to see it.
And you're not gonna get
to the end with this crew.
We are literally
on the bottom here.
But I have to try to find
an avenue for myself,
because nobody out here--
nobody wants to take me
any further than
where I am right now.
Unless I win immunity, I'm out.
But I know that I do
some of my best work
when my back is against a wall.
It sucks.
MICHELE:
And my back is against a wall,
and they haven't seen
the sassy Michele from Jersey.
So it's time for me
to kick it into high gear.
They better buckle in, because
I'm about to go out fighting.

MICHELE:
Can't wait to go back

I have been mad more times
in this game than I've been mad
in a year of my life.
But last night might have been
the peak of anger for me.
I don't trust anybody.
Nobody trusts me.
And I'm very frustrated,
because right now,
everybody's playing scared.
And I'm the only one out here
who's willing
to throw things at the wall,
because I have nothing to lose.
What do you think's
going on today?
SARAH:
I don't know. Nothing.
Nobody's gonna strategize today.
Well, what's there
to strategize about?
I know.
It's just get Michele out next.
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to me.
-Oh, BS.
-I'm blackballed.
-No, I'm...
-You are not.
Yeah, I am.
-You are not.
-I see the writing on the wall.
-Oh, Michele.
-When you're not in,
the only alternative is out.
It's one thing
to get to the end;
it's another to win it
at the end.
-You know?
-Yeah.
You want to win it, right?
Well, of course.
That's the goal.
MICHELE:
So, I just might
throw a Hail Mary in that
direction and see if anybody
bites on it.
There are some people
you just can't beat though.
Who?
You don't think so?
-Hell no.
-And you have
Tony over here who's controlled
most of the votes.
He is a huge threat.
-Why?
-Anybody who goes over to
the jury at this point is gonna
tell who's running the show.
How do you know
who's running the show?
Perception is everything.
I think when you look at
who you should target,
me or Tony, I would think
go with the bigger threat.
Well, I'm keeping my door open
to literally anybody who needs--
who will walk through it, so...
Goes, "Nobody beats him."
Michele's the easy vote-out.
Michele's on the outs.
And Michele has no allegiance

JEREMY:
Wow. Look at that, huh?
The Edge of Extinction--
I hate this place.
This place sucks.
It drains you.
Morale is down. It's tough.
And just being out of the game,
your mind just wanders.
The whole night, I was
running through my mind like,
"What did I do wrong?
What could I have done
to change my situation?"
But, I mean, you know what?
What am I gonna do?
Like, this is
the situation I'm dealt.
I just got to think about
one day at a time,
just getting back
into this game.
Okay.
We got something new.
PARVATI:
Yul, stop reading it.
WENDELL:
He's already got it.
ETHAN:
He should just drop it and run.
-Yeah.

PARVATI:

when a bunch of teenagers
are hanging out in front of,
like, a convenience store
and a cop pulls up, they--

That stone right out there.
Danni's going for it.
WENDELL: I have been to
the top of the mountain,
and I know that there are
two places that have,
like, stone that you can
overlook everything.
And I was just thinking,
"All right, that might be
the stone throne."
I know I'm the fastest sprinter
on the island.
And, uh, and Natalie--
she's a tremendous runner
and challenge threat.
So I'm like, "Man, I need
to get to this throne first."
(Natalie grunts)
NATALIE:
Having spent so much time
on Extinction,
I knew exactly
where I was going.
I was just worried
that Wendell did, too.
Wendell was so ahead of me
that I didn't see where he went.
But once I got to the clearin,
I noticed the beach
was completely empty.
I knew Wendell had taken
a s-strong left up the hill,
and I knew it was all mine.
(panting)
Yes! Oh, my God.
I was dying,
but I was so excited
that I got the advantage.
It felt really good.
The shortest challenge
we've had so far.
There's a few perks
of being here as long as I have.
TYSON:
Natalie knew exactly
where the throne was.
She's the queen of Extinction.
I'm constantly just watching her
just, like, shift and move.
She's become part of the island.
NATALIE:
He went up the mountain.
Finding the advantage
didn't come from me
just being able to run fast.
It came from being out here
as long as I have,
keeping my head in the game
and never giving up the reins
on this island.
PARVATI:
What is it? Open it.
(panting)
I need to catch my breath.
Initially, my gut reaction was,
like, walk it back to camp,
take myself away
from the group.
But I said, you know what?
It's fine.
I'll go with the flow.
Everybody's kind of, like,
miserable here together.
And we can have it be, like,
a group activity for Extinction.
All right. So, an advantage.
Box is cool.
-Oh.
-(chuckles)
...which I don't have
a lot of time...
-YUL: That's pretty cool.
-PARVATI: Wow.
-NATALIE: That is cool.
-PARVATI: That's exciting.
You could sell it to Denise, who
you know has a ton of coins...
-PARVATI: Yeah.
-NATALIE: Basically.
-Or anybody that I think...
-JEREMY: Anybody.
Because they're all together,
so they'll all pool.
They're all together,
so they'll pool tokens.
Going into this next
battle-back challenge,
obviously, I want to do well.
At this point,
the only goal that I have
is get as many fire tokens
as possible.
And that's all I care about.
♪ ♪
NICK: I'm a little
discouraged because
I have six fire tokens.
I've been saving these puppies
the whole game.
I have all the demand
and none of the supply.
But today is the day.
I look in my bag, and I
actually see something in there.
Hey, look. Yes!
Oh, my God. This is so exciting.
Oh, man.
Oh, this is crazy.
So, my immediate reaction
to this is
I need someone's help.
I only have six fire tokens.
So, I thought I was rich,
but I guess--
You know,
I've landed on Boardwalk here.
(laughs)
I can't even afford this.
So I got to pull in somebody
that has enough tokens
to help me out.
Tony's been my main man,
but he don't have any tokens.
And Michele is the other person
I've been working with.
She does have
enough fire tokens
to help me out here,
and I think
if I reach out to Michele
with this,
it will keep me
in her good graces,
even though I voted out Jeremy.
Hey, Michele.
I'm her last hope.
I'm-I'm her only prayer
of staying in this game,
and I think she's a partner
I can really work with.
I have in the past,
and I think I can with this.
That's why I can't say...

I could buy rice today,

got something.

your facade,

-Okay.
-In case...
-But it costs eight.
-I have six.
-Oh, great.
-I'll give you.
-Yeah, okay.
Uh... (sighs)
It's kind of tough.
All it does is it gives
somebody a disadvantage
in the next immunity challenge.
MICHELE:
Nick betrayed me
on the Jeremy vote.
So I wouldn't be here
on the bottom, struggling
to keep my fire alit
if Nick didn't turn on me.
But I have
absolutely nowhere to go.
At this point,
if I'm voted out tomorrow,
then the fire tokens
are souvenirs in my pocket.
All I can do is try to work
with what I have,
and this is what I have
right now.
It would give them
a disadvantage
-at the next challenge?
-One person a disadvantage.
They won't know
who it came from?
No, they'll have no idea
who it came from.
And I'm, obviously,
only telling you.
Okay. Let's think.
So, we just have to think.
NICK:
I definitely have a lot
to consider,
because this isn't just about
one disadvantage
at an immunity challenge.
It could definitely
go deeper than that.
-Let's cause
a little chaos here.
-Yes.
We have to.
-No.
-No way. (laughs)

is about the endgame
and about winning this game.
We just have to try to use it

immunity challenge.
-First things first,
Nick, got to take it back.
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge,
you're gonna stack blocks
on a beam
while attempting
to avoid trip obstacles.
The first person
to stack their blocks
so they fall like dominoes
hitting the gong...
...wins immunity.
Safe from the vote.
In addition, the winner
earns two fire tokens.
The last time
you can earn fire tokens.
Today is the last day
you can spend fire tokens.
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be
the 16th person voted out
and sent to the Edge.
In addition,
one thing to deal with today.
There's an advantage
being played.
This advantage comes in the form
of a disadvantage.
-(Tony clicks tongue)
-It is being played
against one of you.
The disadvantaged player
will have
30% more beam,
30% more blocks to stack.
Wow.
PROBST:
The player receiving
the disadvantage is...
...Ben.
TONY:
Ooh.
PROBST:
Wow.

Yes, sir. Um, you know,
I've yet to receive a token.
Uh, I've yet to receive
an advantage.
So, I mean,
I guess I'm not making
too many friends this season.
NICK:
I decided to give
the disadvantage to Ben because
if he loses this challenge,
that might be the final straw.
And I hope to start some chao,
maybe get people wanting Ben
out of here so that Michele
can stay, and then Ben
could definitely go.
All right,
we're gonna draw for spots.
We'll get it on.
Wow.
All right, here we go,
for immunity
and two fire tokens.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Day 34. Six people left.
Ben with a 30% more difficult
challenge.
And your first block
dropped, Ben.
Got to get it and come back.
If your blocks hit the sand,
you got to bring them back.
Stop what you're doing
in that turn,
head back
and then come back out.
You can only bring
one block at a time.
The first part
of this course is easier.
You can move more quickly.
But the farther down you go
on this course,
the tighter those steps
will become.
You're trying to balance speed
and precision.
Ben leaps, and it cost him.
Ben's got to get two blocks
and go back.
Every mistake you make
costs you time.
So the question becomes,
"Do I go slow and steady
and hope everybody else fails,
or do I go for broke
and try to pull it out?"
It is Michele
and Tony in the lead.
Sarah right behind.
But Ben is quickly
getting back into it.
Nick has been very steady.
Denise really taking her time.
Like so many
Survivor challenges,
one mistake, and suddenly
you go from last to first.
We are almost dead even
with Michele,
Sarah and Tony.
-Got to have
your blocks stacked...
-SARAH: Go faster.
...just right.
You don't want to use
any more than you need to,
but you don't want to have
too much space
that they don't connect.
This is gonna
come down to the wire.
If nobody makes a mistake,
this could be over shortly.
Michele dropped one.
That's the setback
you're looking for.
Michele has to go back now.
Tony trying to take advantage.
Sarah trying
to take advantage.
Everybody sprinting on day 34.
That is going
to even things up now.
Michele has to come out
and fill a hole,
which is a wasted turn.
Tony with another block.
Sarah with another block.
Ben with another block.
Even with a 30% penalty,
Ben is in this.
It is now Michele,
Ben, Sarah and Tony.
Who will get it done first?
Immunity on the line.
Safety at
Tribal Council tonight.
(Tony exhales)
Michele has enough blocks.
-She's gonna go for it.

Sarah dropped a block.
You've got to go back.
Ben with another block.
He's got one left.
Going for it.
Michele's gonna go for the win
right here!

-Michele, no,
hang-hang here for a minute.
-Sure.
-So, you had a huge reaction.
-Yeah.
What is it about this win?
Is it any win
or today in particular?
It's today in particular,
because I think the conversation
that was happening at camp was,
"Anyone can win,
just not Michele."
So I needed this so bad.
Um, and I'm grateful.
I'm so, so grateful.
Michele, two fire tokens.
Last day you can spend them,
as well.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.
Cannot be voted out
of this game.
As for the rest of you,
day 34 will not be enough
for one of you;
it will be the end.

So now it's on to plan B.
-Can I put out a proposal?
-TONY: Sure.

to make a nice big pot of rice,
and by dusk,
I will buy that bag of rice.

to make sure that you guys
also stay strong."
And so we got
an extra bag of rice.
But I'm trying
to roll with the idea,
especially for Michele
and for Nick,
that I'm the plan B
without overplaying my hand
with the hopes
that Ben and Sarah
and Tony and I
are all still in lockstep,
and we'll vote out Nick,
barring any other surprises.
Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.
-Of course. Of course.
And we're all there. No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-That's cool.
-Bring it here.
Okay, okay.
-Okay.
-TONY: All right.
BEN:
Prior to Michele winning,
she was a target.
But my game plan now is
to get the vote swung on Nick.
Nick's just got to go.
He's good at puzzling,
and he's creating more chaos
around camp.
I love her.
She's amazing.
But I don't want to go
to the end with her.
-Same.
-Denise?
-Like, at the... Yeah.
-For this... For this reason.
-MICHELE: Why?
-She's so lovable.
-Yeah.
She got out the queen.
She's played two idols
at one Tribal.
She just did that. Yeah.
BEN:
We're telling Nick
and Michele that it's Denise.
Denise played a heck of a "poor
me, why me?" and bought rice.
And I think
that, hopefully, they buy it.
-SARAH: We're writing Nick.
-Yeah.
-But we're playing it off
like it's Denise.
-So, so, I... Yeah.
BEN:
I don't think I'll play
the idol tonight, you know?
I-I think
we're pretty locked solid
with Tony and Sarah,
so I feel pretty safe
in our alliance tonight.
TONY:
What's up, Nick?
-You just talk with Ben there?
-Yeah, he said Denise.
NICK:
My plan worked today.
I feel like I'm a genius.
Ben lost.
Michele won. Like, unbelievable.
Everything worked out perfectly.
Michele is in the game
because of me
buying that advantage.
I feel like I'm in
maybe the best position
I've been in this entire game.
So, now I would love to see
Ben go home tonight.
But can I get Tony on board?
What's your read
on the situation?
-Yeah.
-I'll-I'll tell you
what worries me about Ben
is he made the fire to get to
the final three on his season.
He could do that again.
-Exactly. Against any of us.
-I know. That twist, man.
-That fire making twist.
-NICK: It's brutal.
Can you make fire, Michele?
-No.
-TONY: No.
It'd take Ben two minutes.
Wow.
Me, you and Nick make a move
to get rid of Ben.
And then we say,
"Sarah, come with us."
-Because now we have
the-the majority.
-NICK: Mm-hmm.
I don't think it's a bad idea.
TONY:
There's definitely
a big consideration
to get rid of Ben.
Ben won his season
with a fire-making challenge.
I don't want to go up against
Ben. I played a very hard game.
I don't want
to lose it to fire.
I know Ben has an idol now.
So if I'm gonna make a move,
now's the time to make the move
and get rid of Ben.
♪ ♪
But in the meantime,
I want to open up
the spy nest again.
I want to open it up
for business.
My spy nest is...
I-I built it so nice.
It's up there collecting dust.
So I say, you know what?
I got to put it back to use,
because intel in this game
has been the key.
'Cause this is war. And in war,
the more intel you have,
the more you can prepare
yourself for a counterattack.
DENISE:
So...
here's my thoughts.
I anticipate
that you and Tony and Ben
already have a solid three.
Here's my proposal.
I would love nothing more
than to be sitting
in the final three with you two.
TONY:
So, I was open for business,
and the spy nest?
(exhales)
It came through for me big-time,
because I got to hear
a lot of stuff.
DENISE:
Tony's the biggest one
that I do worry about with jury,
only because of his ability
to do that duplicitous...
You know what I mean?
Like, that...
in over here
and totally working over here.
That ability to do that
and the challenge wins.
TONY:
Denise was like, "Hey, guys,
"what are you thinking
about the final four?
Because I don't think
we can beat Tony."
So, once I heard that,
I knew Denise has to go,
because she doesn't
want me in the finals.
If you don't want me
in the finals,
that means I don't
want you in the finals.
So you got to go.
Let's see who gets
the first punch first.
So, i-if it's me,
you and-and Nick
voting for Ben, we need
somebody else, and, uh...
I was tossing the idea
of blindsiding Ben,
but now no more.
So, right now
the pecking order has changed,
and it went straight to Denise.
So, maybe we actually do
do Denise.
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, man.
'Cause if Sarah...
MICHELE:
Tony and Nick
both seemed pretty receptive
to get out Ben.
But Denise is here offering
herself up on a silver platter,
saying, "All right. Take me."
If I mention it to Sarah
and she doesn't say anything,
then I can't...
I got to let it go
and just go with Denise.
All right, so stick with the...
Let's stick
with the Denise plan.
TONY:
Let-Let's just see. Let... Yeah.
But we might be able
to get Ben next time.
MICHELE:
I don't necessarily want Denise
to be the next vote.
I would love
if we could shake things up.
But getting people on board
with a logical plan
in this season
is not as simple as it sounds.
So, again, we're at square one,
and it's back on Denise.
(squawks)
I'm gonna give you something
so you can think about it,
-and you come back to me
and let me know.
-Okay.
-'Cause you're my partner.
-I know.
I-I will lose the game for you.
-Yeah.
-For nobody else.
So, this is what I was thinking.
Denise is no good
because she'll pick Ben.
-I heard her talking
to the well.
-Yeah.
-She will go with Ben.
-Yeah.
So me and you are gonna be
doing... duking out over fire.
Uh, we got to get Nick
to the final four.
Yeah.
So, at this point,
Denise is an option
and Nick is an option.
Denise is a good option
to vote out
because she slayed the queen,
she found an idol.
Denise has won
two immunities at this point.
She's gotten tons
of fire tokens from the Edge.
She hasn't made anybody mad.
And so she could be tough
to beat in the end.
Do you think
Nick's the right vote?
Uh, I-I don't know.
SARAH:
And then you've got
Nick, who...
He's won immunity.
He has come from the bottom
all season and had to play
at the bottom.
I mean, everybody loves
the underdog story, right?
And that is Nick.
And so you can't
not like the guy,
because he's playing
his butt off,
and he's fighting
every day he's out here.
-We're doing this, all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-We're partners. We're partners,
and we have to...
-I'm good.
-We're partners forev... Yes.
-...we have to survive.
-You're my partner in crime.
I got this.
-Okay.
-We have to survive. All right.
-Yes, we will.
SARAH:
Tony and I are totally
the swing vote on this.
And I'm hoping that we pick
the right road to go down,
but everything about
this season's been difficult.
You're playing the season
of Survivor.
The greatest players
who've ever played.
Mistakes are not allowed
in this.
So this vote tonight
is the biggest one yet.
♪ ♪
We'll now bring in the members
of our jury.
All right.
So, let's start
with the immunity challenge.
Michele, you pulled it out,
and your reaction at the end
was pretty big.
Walk me through
why this was such a big win.
Uh, it's been no secret to me
that I'm very, very much
on the bottom.
And how do you know that?
How do you find that out?
Well, nobody would
strategize with me.
Pretty much everybody's like,
"Keep hope alive, Michele."
It's not really
the best thing to hear
when you're trying
to find an in.
So I need this necklace today
like a fish needs water,
like you need a blue button-down
and khakis.
-I-I need it.
-(laughs)
It's as simple as that.
PROBST:
So, Sarah, reason number 57
that you don't let
anyone in the game
ever know they're in trouble,
because that little bit of juice
could have been
the difference today.
SARAH:
100%. You know, I think
when you think you're safe,
you maybe take your foot
off the gas a little bit.
And when you know
you're not safe,
it's pedal to the metal.
PROBST:
Ben, you had
a different experience.
You had a disadvantage
played against you.
30% more challenge
that you had to run.
-That might have been
what cost you.
-Yes, sir.
Uh, you know, a day late,
a block short, right?
It's been the story of my
block career here on Survivor.
You know, it's that adrenaline,
like you were talking about,
that extra push
to-to push towards the end.
And-and I think me and Michele
shared that today.
PROBST:
Do you wonder who
put that disadvantage on you?
BEN:
Uh, I do, you know?
And you kind of look
at everyone over there,
and you-you wonder
if it came from that Edge
or if it came from somewhere
over here, you know?
You just... You don't know.
But I felt I did my best,
and-and, uh,
like I said, a block short.
Nick, are we at the point
in the game
where you start to think
as much about who you want
to take with you as you do
who you want to get rid of?
NICK:
I think we're definitely
at that point.
And the hardest part
of the twist with the Edge
and the fire tokens
and everything
is all the unpredictability
and all the question marks.
But after tomorrow,
all those X's and Y's
should be filled with numbers
to where we can actually
solve the equation
of who we want to be
at the end with.
Sarah, how does this idea
of fire tokens and advantages
coming from the Edge
shift how you have to think
of Survivor?
SARAH:
I mean, you have to manage
not just your coins
but everybody else's coins.
So it just adds
another element to the game of:
Who has enough that-that they
could do something with them?
PROBST:
Michele,
what did you notice
about the fire token
and how it impacted
the way you had to play?
I have gotten emotional over
fire tokens that I've gotten
just because I felt down
over some vote-outs.
It's no surprise here that I've
been left out of a few of those.
So, when I get that
the next morning,
after a really rough night,
sometimes it is
the hope that I need
to keep me going.
So, you know, everybody talks
about how much they're worth
and what they can buy,
but for me,
they were priceless
in this game.
PROBST:
Ben, the tricky part
of having somebody come back
from Extinction is, right now,
everybody's trying to hold tight
to an alliance.
But if anybody in that group
is at all rocky,
they could break everything open
and say, "I got my own idea,
and I've been waiting for
this person to come back in."
How much fear does that add
to the game?
About as much fear as a lion
breaking out of a cage
and one person holding the steak
and then pinning it
to two people's back, right?
And so it's
a very scary situation
in the next couple days
about who's coming
and what they're coming with.
PROBST:
Tony, the tough part is
you're desperately trying
to convince
other people that they've got
a final three they can count on.
So what do you do
to manage what is happening now
in anticipation
of what's going to happen soon?
TONY:
That's a tough question,
and, uh,
the people that are together,
there's a fourth
and there's a fifth
and there's a sixth today,
right?
So, we-we're thinking
about everything.
But, you know,
it's just gonna boil down
to the bonds that we have
and the trust we have tonight.
PROBST:
Denise, how about for you?
DENISE:
You know, not having won
that immunity,
the moves that I have
have become limited.
And coming back and just saying,
"Hey, here's where I'm at."
It's been a great,
incredibly stressful 34 days.
I don't want to be done playing,
but if I am done playing,
I'd like to go to the Edge
with a full belly of rice
so that I can at least try
and battle my way back in.
And let's just eat and let it be
what it's gonna be.
Nick, did that surprise you
that Denise would openly say,
"I think it's me.
And if it is, that's okay,
but can I please have
a last meal"?
NICK:
I mean, it's always
surprising to hear
somebody say that in Survivor.
But we've had some hard,
hard Tribal Councils
in the past week or so,
and I think everyone
has probably felt that way
over-over the past week or so.
But nobody else has come back
and said, "I'm good.
-Just let me eat. I'm ready."
-No.
-And...
-And it's not...
-Go ahead.
-DENISE: And it's not,
"I'm good. I'm ready."
It's, "I don't want to go,
but I can only do so much."
And it's-it's, again, it's
the saying of endure and let go.
It's an acceptance of what is.
It's-it's that gut intuition
of saying,
"I just don't want
to scramble anymore."
I just can't do
the cat and mouse.
And I don't want
to be the choice,
and you hope that some alliances
or some ideas that you...
you put out there can stick.
But that's it.
-No.
-PROBST: Nick, any of you guys
that have played this game know
how demoralizing it can be
at times
and how much mental fatigue
it takes.
So when you hear Denise say,
"I'm not giving up,
but I'm not gonna
scramble today,"
as a player,
is that a little bit of,
"Wow, this might be
the easy vote, finally"?
NICK:
Yeah.
I think
whatever the game hands you,
you kind of have to go with it
and use it to your advantage
to move forward in the game.
And, uh, that's what
it handed me today.

as much as I hate this place,
I'm sort of gonna miss it.
It's not really the people.
It's just, um... (sniffles)
I'm gonna miss
this amazing view.
ROB:
Anybody want to climb up the
mountain and see the sunrise?
AMBER:
For the very last time.
You know,
it's beautiful out here.
It's peaceful.
Even though my husband
is here-- thank God he's here--
it's forced me to slow down,
take a break.
I don't do that at home.
I never sit around.
I'm just go, go, go.
So, it's... it's a weird way
to force yourself
to sit down
and just think about life
and what matters most
and what you miss.
A 360 view.
Because what I miss
about home are my kids.
But I think what I'm gonna
miss about here
is the simplicity of it all.
You know, we don't have
any distractions or--
There's nothing here.
It's simple.
But that's the blessing.
You don't get to do that
at home.
WENDELL:
Oh, people about

JEREMY:
Uh-oh.
WENDELL:
Oh, man.

ROB:

A hundred percent.
Man.
I'm ready for the challenge.
NATALIE:
Oh, my God, 35!
ROB:
Last day on the Edge.
This is it, do or die.
I'm ready.
I have a hidden immunity idol
that I purchased
before the last
bring-back challenge.
Luckily, it's still good.
Yeah!
(whooping)
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
(whooping)
KIM: Seeing the people
that have been out here
from the beginning is
a good reminder for me, like,
that I'm gonna have to bring it
at this battle-back challenge.
It's not gonna be a cakewalk.
...two, three.
(whooping)
I got my two tokens.
I worked hard at that.
All right, friends,
we got some scrolls.
(others whooping, oohing)
This can buy me one advantage
in the challenge,
and that will give me
some sort of edge up.
I know that I got to put
my war paint on
and go to battle.
And that's what I'm best at.
Now that I've had a chance
to see the fire tokens
actually used and in play,
I think it adds
a really interesting dynamic.
It adds a layer of
nuance and complexity
and flexibility
that didn't exist before.
So I'm inclined to use my tokens
for an advantage
in the challenge.
Get my warrior hairstyle.
I'm on the Edge,
but there's still a game
bubbling underneath the surface.
So I think that's what's given
me a lot of spark to continue.
The Edge is really
the hard fight.
I'm using my two fire tokens on
an advantage in the challenge.
For me, I've got my eye
on the prize, and the prize is
getting into this battle-back
and winning it.
ETHAN: I'm gonna
approach the challenge
like I approach any challenge:
give it 100%, hope for the win,
and just do my best.
But it's a little unnerving
knowing that
there's a few people
that have one advantage.
Natalie's gonna have
three advantages and an idol,
plus a surplus of tokens.
I got nothing.
-(laughter)
-ROB: You guys ready to play?
WENDELL:
Let's go.
NATALIE:
It took me a long time
to get over
being voted off first
and feeling that worthlessnes.
I feel like I've been grinding
slowly and quietly for so long,
but all this hard work
is worth it.
It's not one day's work.
This is 32 days
of being on Extinction,
keeping my head in the game,
never giving up here,
and fighting for
everything I have.
I feel like I've proved myself
out here.
And I fully feel like
I deserve one of the spots to be
fighting for
that winner's title
and a shot at being
the best of the best.
My token count
before making my purchases
for this final battle-back
was 14 tokens.
I bought peanut butter.
I bought three advantages.
So I'm going in stacked
in advantages-- three total.
That's the max I can get.
I basically have
six tokens left, plus
I bought this idol
way back when.
Um, it's still good,
and it's still ready
to be put to use.
But I can only
walk into the game with one.
So that's why I decided
to buy a second idol--
not for me, it is for Tyson--
and spread the protection
between Tyson and I,
hoping that one of us get back
in and wreck shop back there.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
Isn't it crazy?
It's so simple.
-It's kind of cool though.
-It is cool.
(cheering in distance)
Get back in the game,
I'm gonna put it to good use.
If I don't get back in the game,
I'm saving it for you to have
after you win.
Yeah, exactly.
Either way,
good luck today, dude.
Thanks, Natalie.
I really appreciate it.
I played the game four times,
and it's very rare.
I don't think
I've ever experienced
that type of generosity
from another player.
And, yeah, it-it does
mean something, because
even though everybody's trying
to fight for the same prize,
you know, when you feel
that somebody is
also rooting for you, it gives
you a little more motivation
to push, to focus,
to just stretch to your limit.
The real final hurdle
to the endgame is today.
If I get back in the game,

-...you are playing for.
-NICK: No way.
-KIM: What?
-Surprise!
-BEN: Surprise!
PROBST:
The biggest loved one visit
ever seen
reignited the fire
of every player.
JEREMY:
This is the reason why
I almost didn't play,
and this is the reason
why I'm playing.
TONY:
This is not a dream come true,
man, it's a fantasy come true.
Oh, my God, it's our families!
TONY:
All these families
you see here,
that's what made us all bond.
That's what made us be strong
throughout this game, man,
these guys right here.
ETHAN:
I felt so filled up with love,
it breathed new life into me.
Let's kick this into high gear.
You know, it's crazy.
PROBST:
For 35 days, the pace
has been unrelenting...
TONY:
My spying has evolved.
It's called the spy nest.
-(spitting)
-(laughs)
SARAH:
There is a Steal a Vote hidden
at the other tribe's camp.
I'm going for it.
PROBST: ...the level
of gameplay unprecedented.
ADAM: Can I play it?
I want to play that.
PROBST:
This thing that you can't get
-off of the voting podium?
-Yeah.
Uh, yeah.
That is...
-not a hidden immunity idol.
-Worth a shot.
Well, that's for you.
PROBST:
This is safety without power.
The safety is "I'm leaving."
-Wow.
-The without power is
"I will not vote."
What the hell happens now?
(chuckles)
The tribe has spoken.
Again.
-No.
-PROBST: Sophie.
Need to bring me your torch.
Oh.

PROBST:
Now only five remain:
Ben...
BEN:
This isn't the end of the work.
I'm gonna win this game
by having an alliance
and keeping everybody safe.
And when the gun smoke settles,
hopefully I'm sitting there
with a couple more rounds in
my pocket, not one in my chest.
PROBST:
...Denise...
DENISE:
I've crossed my T's,
dotted my I's--
the alliances that I've made,
the relationships
that I've built.
I've won
two immunity challenges.
I got to take out the queen,
and I found an idol.
My Survivor bucket
is full and overflowing.
PROBST:
...Michele...
MICHELE:
I want to prove to
all those people who doubt me
I did deserve my first season.
It wasn't a fluke.
I'm a good player,
and I do belong here
with the best of the best.
PROBST:
...Sarah...
SARAH:
I want a battle at the end.
I want to go out
with a legacy,
knowing Sarah was not scared.
And I want to teach my son
your mom's not scared
to go against the threats,
because I believe
I can beat them.
PROBST:
...and Tony.
TONY:
If I can pull this off
and get that two million
at the end,
and they crown me
the king of Survivor,
and I sit in Sandra's throne,
the queen, I sit on her throne
and I have the crown on...
(sputters)
(laughs) What?
I'll be the happiest person
in the world.
