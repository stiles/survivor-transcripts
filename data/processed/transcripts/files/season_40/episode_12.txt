BEN:
Wow, big move, Tony.
Well played, sir.
TONY:
It was-- it was--
it was a last-minute thing, man.
-BEN: Yeah?
-Yeah.
JEREMY: 
Tribal Council was crazy.
Ben tried to make a move on me, 
but Sophie went to the Edge.
So there's hard feelings.
Ben is pissed.
He's not even talking to me. 
It's so crazy.








He's such a child.
Like, grow up, Ben.
Come on, man.
The game goes up and down. 
Just chill out and let's play.
You guys had us duped.
You want to go talk, Sarah?
SARAH: 
This was Tony's idiotic move.
But I told myself, "Sarah,
just keep your cool
and don't be pissed."
-You just sunk my game.
-No.
-I'm done. Those guys
don't want to work with me.
-Yo.
-It's me that flipped, not you.
You didn't flip. I did.
-Oh-- Okay--
-I wrote Michele's name down.
-I know. That's fine...
-Jeremy don't want
to work with me.
-That's fine.
-You don't need them.
I'm with you. I'm...

-I swear. I swear.
-You're not with me.
SARAH: 
To have Tony come up with this 
all alone,
I'm absolutely infuriated 
with him.
It's ridiculous.
It's a $2 million game.
What are you doing, dude?
We were fine.
And now do we even have 
the numbers?
You think we do, 
but you don't know if we do.
I have an idol
and I can pay up fine.
-I understand that.
-You're not going anywhere,
Sarah.
-All right.
-If I jeopardize anybody's game,
it's mine.
I swear to my family,
I didn't want to blindside you.
-I'll tell you this right now.
-Yeah.
I will let all of this go...
-Under what condition?
-...until it sinks me.
-Aw, man.
-Then it's not gone.
-Yeah.
-I get voted out,
-do not talk to me ever again.
-No, come on.
TONY: 
Wow, man.
Usually, 
you blindside somebody,
you go back to camp,
you hash it all out,
and everybody's like,
"It's okay. It's all good."
Not this time. This time,
it's like deep wounds, man.
But, come on, 
give me a break.
I'm playing the game, too, 
you know?
This is war. Stop crying.
Put your man panties on
and go to war.
I am with you 100%.
It was just tonight,
-and I wanted to make that move.
-Okay.
And I promise to you,
I did not want to hurt you
-or go with that side.
-Right.
And I'm gonna tell you
something.
I have an idol. Okay?
-You have one?
-I have an idol.
-Where'd you...
-I found it on the rock.
-Really?
-Yeah.
So, I'm telling you
the truth, guys.
I want to go
to the end with you guys.
BEN: Tony's telling me 
about all his advantages
and all his idols,
so he's gaining trust.
But I don't know if I trust him,
because he's
blindsided me hugely.
-The reason why I'm so upset...
-Yeah.
...is because
Jeremy's still here.
-And because I'm...
-[splat]
-Ooh.
-What the ... is that?
-You just got ... on.
-By what?
-A bird.
A-- What bird
is in the nighttime?
-[laughs] 
-BEN: I still want Jeremy 
out next.
A] He is a challenge beast, 
right?
And B] He is a jury threat.
He's gonna get all the votes.
Like, there's just no way 
for me to work with Jeremy,
so I am not talking 
to Jeremy right now,
and I don't want to talk 
with Jeremy right now.
-Are you sure that's a bird?
-I'm po-- Where else-- Or bat.
-A bat?

Is that good or bad?
BEN:
That's some karma.
TONY:
Oh, my God.
[crickets chirping]
♪ 
TONY: 
I made a big power move, 
which was blindsiding Sophie.
The backlash was unbelievable, 
so I think I'm in trouble.
My wife told me, "Tony,
this time you can't play wild.
You can't play crazy.
You can't play flashy."
But I got the itch,
and now this is the time 
for another
undercover operation.
In my first season, 
season 28 inCagayan,
I made a spy shack, 
and it worked.
You know, he lied to my face.
TONY: 
And then,Game Changers, 
my second season,
I made the underground bunker.
It was a failure, 
but it was fun.
Right now, 
my spying has evolved,
and now I'm up in the air.
It's called the spy nest.
It's like a bird nest
that I perch myself on, just
like a bird, and I sit there
and I wait 
to hear conversations
that are going on.
The only person 
that knows I'm undercover
is my partner, Sarah.
It's only me,
and nobody's coming.
No, I can't see you at all,
dude. It's... golden.
If we were in the real world 
and Tony and I were partners,
one of us would be fired, okay?
Tony's back to the old Tony,
and it's nonstop-- go, go, go.
And he doesn't let up.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.
-All right.
SARAH: 
He's got my back 
and I got his back
and we're not gonna turn 
on each other.
But if he's not willing 
to back off
a little, then he's gonna
get himself voted out.
How are you today?
How'd you sleep, Ben?
-What's that?
-How'd you sleep?
It was all right.
JEREMY:
You want to talk?
No.
-No?
-Nah.
-I don't.
-Why not?
'Cause I said no.
That's all.
I just don't want to.
[chuckling]
-Never seen anything like it.
-Yeah.
KIM: 
Last night was emotional 
and a little bit crazy.
And it's super clear 
people are thinking
Jeremy's gonna go next.
But hell no.
I mean, I'm not doing that.
For me, it's really obvious
that Tony and Sarah 
are a problem right now.
But I still have a relationship
with Sarah 
that can be salvaged.
I'd so much rather 
see Tony go than Sarah.
And I'm done 
with the sitting around,
hoping that I'm on
the right side of the votes.
-This is where I'm at.
-We have to-- Okay.
-Tony has to go.
-He has to.
Yeah.
Right.
Wow. I think you're right.
Yeah.
-What are we gonna do?
-Yeah, exactly.
-Sit and wait?
-Yeah.
-Just get picked off eventually.
-Uh-huh.
KIM: 
This is by far the riskiest 
move I've ever had to make,
but I have to do something.
I mean, I have to turn
this around or go out trying.
To me, this is the point where
you flip the light switch on
-and go, "Okay, here we go."
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, and then hope
you make it.
-Yeah.
Amen. I agree.
-I'm 100% with you...
-I'm 100% in with you.
MICHELE: 
Tony has been running the show,
and we've been left out 
of the loop.
We've been made fools of.
And I think a lot of us 
are feeling that way right now.
I... agree.
MICHELE: 
This game is about power.
And this seems like 
a perfect opportunity
to gain a little bit of control 
in this game

Now we don't know
where an idol's at.

DENISE: 
There's been 
a mad dash already,
and there's a lot of hands 
out here digging.
There may be another hidden 
immunity idol in the mix,
which complicates everything
all over again.
Everybody's looking 
through the dirt
and the cobwebs

immunity idol before Tony

Last person left standing
wins immunity.

a lot more difficult.
That went an hour.
And now we have made it
even more difficult.

I tried to do my best 
to win that immunity challenge,
and I was falling off.
At least I get
one of Tony's fire tokens,
peanut butter 
and chocolate chip cookies.
And Jeremy goes home, anyways, 
and there's no harm.
So I think it's a win-win.
Like, I can't help
but just be, like,
sad that it would be Jeremy.
Yeah. Well, I'm...
I really do think
you, me, Nick and Denise
-could be a thing.
-Same.
MICHELE: 
I am distraught.
I've been close with Jeremy 
since day one in this game.
He's kind of been, like, 
my true family out here.
But I don't know
how we get out of this pickle.
BEN: 
Okay.
-So, they're all
voting Jeremy tonight.
-Mm-hmm.
-You... But you won immunity.
-Yeah.
So they can't do that now.
Yeah, yeah. You heard them
say "Tony," though?
Who's they?
TONY: 
Oh, Kim is.
TONY: 
I just found this news out. 
Kim was chirping
in everybody's ear,
"Maybe it's Tony's time to go."
And it's a big deal to me.
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Oh. Oh, uh...
Trying to remember. Uh...
[exhales]
TONY: 
I'm talking to Nick,
and he's looking at me, 
and he's fumbling his words.
I keep asking him, "Nick,
what's going on?"
He's always lost.
Like, come on, man. Nick is 
lying to me right in my face.
Are they really trying
to get me out, you think?
-She just mentioned it to me.
-Who's she?
-Kim. Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, Kim said it?
But...
Okay. Okay.
-Oh.
-[laughs]
-Here you go. Yeah, yeah.
-Thanks for doing that, man.
So, now I'm 100%
worried about Kim
trying to get these 
lower-tier threats together.
So, if Jeremy goes home, 
we're screwed,
'cause the ladies 
are gonna stick together
and possibly use Nick.
SARAH:
So, at this point,
we're writing Jeremy down.
At this point, we-we might
have to work with Jeremy, man.
No, but we can't piss Ben off.
Well, this is what happened.
Ben told me
that the girls were
talking about me
this morning, 
a-and Nick didn't even come
-tell me that. 
-SARAH: Mm-hmm.
-See? 'Cause he ain't with us. 
-TONY: And he was.
Okay.
-He told Tony about...
-No.
-Yeah. And-and...
-No.
-Damn it.
-Yeah.
-[groans] That's so frustrating.
-I know, it sucks.
When I heard it...
If Kim stays in the game
and Jeremy goes,
next vote,
Nick goes with the girls.
-And it's done.
It's done. We are done.
-I-I think...
But we got to vote out
Jeremy because
we got to try and preserve Ben
as our number
because we don't have
any other option.
I don't think... I-I think
Ben is gonna destroy our game
-if we're scared of what to do.
-I know.
Okay, so you got to talk
to Ben, then.
BEN:
Hey.
-We're good, right?
-I'm good with you.
-Okay.
-Right? Now, now, now, Ben,
you're-you're 100% on Jeremy?
-Yes. Right?
-Okay, okay.
No, I-I was thinking if-if there
was any way I could beg you
or pay you, even, a fire token
if you could just hear me out
with the Kim thing.
-Yes. Okay.
-Okay.
We get rid of Jeremy tonight,
Kim is gonna get
Michele, Denise.
-They're gonna get Nick.
Nick just...
-No.
I just talked to Nick right now.
He's playing me like a fiddle.
-He's lying to me.
-Nick made his bed
with you today.
Right? He gave you immunity.
He didn't give it to me. He was
falling off the challenge.
He can go to the end with Kim.
-That's what he wants to do.
-Well, that's... [grunts]
-what he thought.
-That's what he wants to do.
So, once-once Jeremy's gone,
they're coming after us.
They have the numbers.
Me, you, Sarah.
Ping, ping, ping. Gone.
And then we... Hey, listen.
The-the soldier and the two cops
and the fireman
-will stick together and get rid
of these little rats.
-Right.
I don't think
Nick's gonna do that.
I don't honestly think so.
-I mean, I...
-Please, bro.
Jeremy is the number one horse
to win this frickin' game.
We can get him out...
get her out next time.
Okay.
-We can't.
-Okay.
Do you think it's on you or me?
You, I think.
If I give the advantage to you,
then you play it for yourself,
-and if it doesn't work,
then doesn't work.
-[groans]
MICHELE: 
Everybody is voting Jeremy,
and I don't think that I can 
shift the tides and save him.
I have to write
Jeremy's name down,
but it doesn't mean
that I can't try
to throw him a bone 
to help him out.
-Word?
-Kim's got to go, bro.
And we don't have...
And we can't trust...
Oh. So, who are you voting for?
Michele was gonna
give me something.
Okay.
I want to talk to you about
-us moving forward.
-Right.
Like, I don't want to butt heads
with you no more.
-Like, I feel like
we need each other.
-Right.
So, who would you
take out, then?
I mean, we can go after Kim.
-Yeah.
-Listen, I'm trying
to build trust
-back with you. I'm trying
to give you a little bit.
-I know.
-I know.
-All right?
JEREMY: 
He can't even talk to me.
And I could still see him, 
like, stewing.
Like, okay. What do I do now?
Something's going on.
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't even figure it out.
All right, play it tonight.
Let me have it. Let me have it.
Let me have it. Let me have it.
Oh, my God.
JEREMY: 
I don't feel in control 
of my game.
I have the 50/50 idol 
in my pocket.
If all else fails, 
I can use that.
But it could be an idol,
it could be nothing.
It's a flip of the coin.
I might not be coming back 
to camp tonight.
Starting to get paranoid.
This is... This is not good.
This is the part of the war 
that's gonna get really ugly.
This is gonna be
more like friendly fire.
♪ 
PROBST:
So, Denise,
last Tribal Council,
it was really calm.
And then the vote happened,
and I'm guessing
when you went back to camp,
-it wasn't as calm.
-DENISE: Oh, yeah.
It was like watching
bad family therapy.
Fighting, yelling,
betrayal, anger, hurt.
It was mass chaos.
Kim, is it one of
those situations where,
in the heat of the moment,
people might have been willing
to say something,
but once a new day begins,
you go, "Okay,
maybe we all need to calm down"?
KIM:
Absolutely.
Everything changes
almost every day.
The person that was
on the bottom yesterday
can be the one
calling the shots today.
I think if you can make it
through another day,
-it's like a clean slate
in a lot of ways.
-TONY: Jeff,
it's shifting a lot faster
than day by day.
I think it's shifting
minute by minute,
hour by hour,
much more fluidly than
-day by day.
-JEREMY: Jeff, we're running
on an endless treadmill.
-[laughs]
-No matter what time
you put on that thing,
it's exhausting.
PROBST:
Michele,
let's talk about
today's challenge.
Kim, yourself and Nick
all dropped out
for peanut butter and chocolate.
Denise and Tony win immunity.
What happens in that moment?
It can't simply be,
"I'm just really hungry."
MICHELE:
No. And me and Kim
were just torn up with regret.
We didn't feel confident
that we could last any longer.
But then when you step down,
you're like,
"Well, what if somebody
makes a mistake
the next minute,
and now we just stepped down?"
So, every decision
that you make,
of course you're riddled
with regret and anxiety.
-PROBST: Kim, agree with that?
-KIM: Yeah. I mean,
the truth is
I completely regret it.
I felt like
my bucket was tipping,
and so I heard myself say,
"I'm coming down."
At this moment, I would
so much rather have fallen
two seconds and not gotten
the peanut butter
than have stepped down,
and then I know
for sure that it wasn't falling.
-PROBST: Nick,
how about for you?
-Well,
Tony gave me a fire token
to step down,
so I feel like I got
the food temptation
and then also
the fire token temptation.
But...
I mean,
stepping down
from a challenge...
PROBST:
I got to interrupt.
Is this so common
that you can actually answer
my question
while it's still going on?
NICK: I guess it's... Yeah,
I think it's becoming common.
I mean, I thought everybody
was on the same page.
And this is an argument
to not step down
no matter how confident
you are in your place
in the game
and how much
you trust your allies,
because it can...
change like that,
even at Tribal.
Denise, everything was
going just fine.
Oh, my God.
We cannot even get through
one Tribal Council
and just freaking focus.
It's like a tribe
of crazy, paranoid players,
and it's driving us nuts.
PROBST:
And we're ringside.
They're coming
around the first turn.
[laughter]
They're all up.
Except for Sarah, still seated.
Ben in the middle, seated.
Tony and Jeremy talking.
Kim.
Okay. Okay.
I don't.
-PROBST: Sarah, is there a...
-What?
-[laughs]
-Sorry.
-SARAH: What was that, Jeff?
-[laughs]
Is there a point
when you just say, "I can't have
any more conversations;
if it's me, then it's me"?
I would say I'm, like,
at my peak at this point.
I mean, it is just mentally
and emotionally exhausting.
I mean, this is ridiculous.
And you have people
on the Edge of Extinction
-who are losing their mind
in a different way.
-SARAH: Right.
Uh, here's the thing.
They sit there and would give
anything to be us,
and we would like
to be able to shut off.
It's the price you pay. I mean,
I don't want to trade seats
with anyone,
but I'm definitely not enjoying
sitting in this seat very much.
Maybe we just wait
till you're done and we vote.
Maybe there's nothing
to be said tonight.
Right?
-I'm done.
-You're done with what?
I'm ready to vote.
I'm seriously like...
-Are you-you...
You sure you want to do that?
-Yeah.
JEREMY:
You know you're just
-safe tonight, though, right?
-I-I...
-You sure
you want to do that?
-I fully realize that.
