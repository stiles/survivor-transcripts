 playing really aggressive. No. It's Survivor. I don't have to. Really hard. That's not a threat.
That's an ultimatum. And you best believe
 Rome's causing a whole lot of ruckus. ANDY:
 We can agree
to play these amulets together, and they would have the effect of a hidden immunity idol. Sierra really wants
 to keep Anika around. I feel like a piece of crap. SAM:
 I really want
 to keep Andy around. So, we have to figure out
 what the heck we're gonna do. Fifth person voted out
of Survivor 47: Anika. Who-who owned this? -It was the three of us.
-Three votes. The tribe has spoken. ANDY:
 Look, uh, Tribal Council sucks. Not. (laughs) That was fun as hell. That was blindside city. Anika wanted me out
 since day two. I wanted her out
 at the same time. It was really exciting
 because it just felt like this big plan
 that really came together exactly how I wanted it to go, which is
 a new feeling for me out here. I have flipped the script. Rachel was feeling so confident, and now, ostensibly,
 Rachel is on the bottom. I first want to apologize that
you were left out of the vote because I genuinely feel connected to Ani,
and I know you do, too. So, it's like,
I don't want you to be -upset with us.
-Yeah, I mean, obviously... I'm not mad, guys.
We're playing Survivor. -Like, I get it.
-SAM: Well, I mean... -But I'm confused
-Well, I... -why I was left out.
-Wait, wait, wait.
I know. One-one... -RACHEL: I mean...
-SAM: I'm sorry for leaving you -out of the vote, as well.
-SIERRA: I'm so sorry. -That's not what
we wanted to do.
-Because I... really, really, really want
to play the game with you. -Yeah, so...
-ANDY: Just for my part,
like, I feel like Anika was sort of a wedge
between us. I knew she wanted me out. Yeah. I mean, she did
want you out from the start. SAM:
Yeah. And I'm sorry for
putting your name down, Andy. I thought that that was
the consensus vote, and I'm... I'm just trying to be
with the numbers and be safe, and that's not a good excuse. -And we can talk
about it, but...
-We can talk, yeah. RACHEL:
 I was absolutely taken aback
 by tonight's vote. It felt like a big betrayal,
 and it's not a good reality to be at the bottom
of the tribe, especially when
 you consider, like... Wow, I really thought Andy was at the bottom
of the tribe for the last week, and somehow I am the person
at the bottom of the tribe. -This went about as good
as it could have gone.
-SIERRA: Yeah. It was clean, we didn't break out the idol, so... I chose not to play
my hidden immunity idol. Tonight was the last
Tribal Council it was good for, and I didn't play it tonight
 because Andy doesn't know I have said idol, and I didn't want to lose trust. So, I chose to see if I can use it
 further down the road as a decoy or a fake or something
to just have some fun with. RACHEL:
Man, this game. As soon as you think you have
a grasp of what's going on, -it just flips you on your head.
-It just changes. But tomorrow, maybe... I know. -Yeah.
-But it's, like,
we can just start from zero. Things change on a dime. RACHEL:
 I've hit my rock-bottom game
 at this point. I need other pathways. And so,
I want more than anything for merge to come,
like, immediately. I'm hoping for,
like, a lifeline. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ A boat? ANDY: Yeah. SAM: Oh. -RACHEL: Yeah.

 that was last night. Now I get an entire beach

 and use that as rocket fuel to get myself into this merge. (gasps) Oh, no. "Drop your Buffs!" -(Teeny screams)

-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God. -Baby.
-Oh, my God! Wow. TEENY: Every Survivor player
 wants to live to see the day that it says, "Drop your Buffs." And for me in particular,
this just feels like a new lease on life
 because I was so nervous about my life in this game. But at the same time,
 I'm Buffless right now. I don't have a home.
 I don't know if I'm going to have a home. But I'm certainly very excited
to go and find one. Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go, man.
Let's get it. (Tiyana gasps) -(Caroline screams)
-Oh, my God! (indistinct shouting) Oh, my God! -What the heck?!
-Come on. GABE: I was somebody who wanted
to etch my legacy in stone. I want to put my head on the new-era Mount Rushmore
 of Survivor. And to do that,
 you got to make the merge. We're not quite
at the merge yet, but pre-merge, in Survivor, it's Survivor elementary school. And the actual merge
 is Survivor high school. That's where
 the big dogs come out, and I'm ready to graduate. They're coming here? -They're coming here.
-They're coming here.
-What?! When I heard that they were all
 coming over, I'm like, "Shoot. They're gonna look
through our bags." So that got me very paranoid because I knew
 I needed to clean my idol... ...because it's covered
 in freakin' red paint. The idol,
 when it came crashing down, it was in a jar of red paint. It took me so long to clean up
 the mess to begin with. ♪ ♪ I just took the idol and put it back in the paint-filled tube. But while I was scurrying

 on the journey, and No-Vote Kyle feels a little
uncomfortable in the world, so, of course an advantage
 would be nice for me. GENEVIEVE: I want this advantage very badly, but unfortunately, the clue says "somewhere,"
and I have no internal compass, so... uh... This is nice.
This should be a swimming spot. -SAM: This water...
-GENEVIEVE: What is the... -This water...
-What is the buoy? I have no idea. I think I've seen a couple
of those floating around. You are. -Yeah. Yes.
-Right. Of course it's so important
to have an advantage in that pivotal,
pivotal challenge. But you know what

Who isn't? Like, what are we doing?
We're chilling at the camp right now? There's an advantage out there. What the hell, guys? I get it.
Time to build bonds, but it's, like, we got work to do. SOL: We have to find it. -We have to find it.
-Right? I mean, that would be... There's, like,
red paint up here, too. Has anybody looked
over here yet? SOL:
What the hell is up
with this paint? SAM:
Yeah, there's a lot of red. Right here, too. Look. TIYANA:
Oh. SIERRA:
 We're at the water well. Red, splattered paint
everywhere. It looks like a murder scene
out here. It's all over this area, though. -(Genevieve gasps)
-SIERRA: Whoa. SIERRA:
 And then there's some, like, pottery pieces
that are saturated red paint. Here's another one. Oh, what the heck? That's interesting. It starts feeling
like a murder mystery. -Gotcha.
-TIYANA: Yeah, gotcha.
Thank you. (indistinct shouting) CAROLINE:
And then, Rome digs a little bit and sees a huge pot with a bunch of red paint. SIERRA:
That's shattered pottery. CAROLINE:
With a bunch of red in there. KYLE:
What the heck? CAROLINE:
 When I see that red paint, my mind flashes to Sue
at their water well. Did you fall? I was playing with the machete.
I'm good. I just... It's okay. CAROLINE:
 And I think Sue found the idol! Sue is playing this game. I am proud of Sue,
 and I'm gonna keep her secret no matter what. RACHEL:
Hi. You missed out on a fiasco. SIERRA:
There's a weird, -like, red paint thing going on.
-What? When I heard that everyone found
 this mysterious red paint, my heart sunk. No way. Now I know I am busted. SUE:
 I feel like a criminal that they found
a little piece of evidence, and now the cops are coming
 and I can hear the sirens coming closer to me. It looks like a crime scene. -Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
-It really does. SUE:
 And I had this panic inside. But the smartest thing to do
 is just keep my mouth shut right now
and see how it plays out. GENEVIEVE:
 Everyone's chilling,
 but I just can't let go of this advantage concept,
 and I've got one place in my mind
that I want to check. I can't stop thinking
about this stupid buoy. It's like this little bee
 in my bonnet of, like, why is that out there? It's probably nothing. All of the Tukus
would have checked this if it was something. But it stands out
 to me as something. I'm going in the water. I hate it.
This is not gonna be it and I'm gonna get eaten
by a shark just 'cause it's bothering me in my head. Ugh! I get out there, and even
as I'm one foot away, I'm like, "This is just a random buoy." But as I'm, like,
one inch away... (laughs) ...I see
something is attached to it. I'm like, "This can't be real." Oh, my God. I never find anything. (gasps softly) And now,
 I finally found something. -Guys?
-Oh.
-TIYANA: Yay! You found it? -It was the buoy?!
-Yes. Genevieve, it was the buoy?! GENEVIEVE:
It was the buoy, Sam. SAM:
No way. GENEVIEVE:
 Sam was kicking himself, 'cause he's like,
 "Yeah, we saw that buoy. We said it was nothing." Should have gone
for a swim, Sam. (all groaning) Boo. KYLE:
So, what was the deal
with the red paint? -GABE: I have no idea.
-TIYANA: We don't know. GENEVIEVE:
So now we know the paint
is something different. -Someone's got something else.
-SUE: Oh, boy. -Let the games begin.
-GABE: Yeah. TIYANA: A few days ago, Caroline and I found Sue
covered in red stuff. And immediately, my red flag was raised, because I was
kind of confused as to what she could have possibly done.
 But now it's kind of starting
to make sense to me. SUE: Caroline figured it out.
 I trust Caroline the most. I feel that
 she'll keep my secret. But the problem is I feel Tiyana knows, and I see how she can flip-flop. So she's always gonna be
that middle person that I'm not gonna always trust. And if I have to chop the head
 of the snake off I will, to protect myself. Ko hl 's L ow es t Pr ic es of the Season

-SAM: Rainbow. Good. ROME:
 What I'm trying
 to do right now in this game is try and get as much
 information as possible... ROME:
 ...because information is key. And so, if you're able
to trust someone with some information, that's massive in this game. So last night, Kyle--
 me and him-- while we're
 sitting there talking, he'd let way too many names
 fly out of his mouth. ROME:
 He's sitting here saying
 that Sam is the person that he feels like
could win this game easily. Then I asked him,
 "Okay, if that's how you feel about one of the guys..." ..."which lady
are you most threatened by?" And he said, "Tiyana." ROME:
 He also told me
 with Caroline and Sue, they're not really good
at challenges, and they're not really doing
that well socially, either, so, he's essentially
 writing them off already. So what do I do
 with that information? That's not true. The more information
 that I have like that, the more I can
 warn the people that are the targets of someone that, "Hey, people
are coming for you." I'm not surprised
that he's bashing me. I mean, he wrote my name down. ROME:
 And if people feel like I'm the one
bringing them that information, then I'm the one that they're
gonna want to keep around. -Thank you
for letting me know.
-Yeah. SUE:
 After hearing
 that Kyle's still chirping about me and Caroline, my daggers are out again. I want Kyle
to be the first target. I was talking with Kyle, and pretty much
he was telling me the scarier thing
in the game right now is Sam. -Oh, really?
-Like, to him specifically.
Yeah. I asked him,
"Okay, well, for the ladies, who's the most threatening?"
And he said you. What the ..., dude? I'm just letting you know. TIYANA: My mind immediately
 goes racing because Kyle is one
of my closest allies. Like, it wouldn't make any sense for him to start
throwing out my name. That makes no sense to me. I said it a million times. I'm gonna play with my gut. And once he told me that,
 my gut feeling-- it wasn't a, "Oh, my gosh,
I'm nervous, and I am paranoid." It was a,
"That doesn't feel right." Rome told me that
Kyle threw my name out there -last night at the beach.
-Last night? That's wild. SOL:
Just so you guys both know,
this is what Rome does. Oh, he, like... TIYANA: Really? -You think he would
make that up to us?
-Yes. -This is how he plays his game.
-ANDY: It's good to know. SOL:
 The thing about Rome is,
 Rome just talks, talks, talks, and it's crap, crap, crap. So I needed to make sure, like, "Hey,
whenever you're talking to Rome, you got
to fact-check this stuff." True. So, Rome told Tiyana
that you said she's the biggest threat
in this game. -Oh, my God. Really?
-Yeah. Did you say anything?
I mean, I'm not... No. He told me that he thinks
Tiyana's the most dangerous girl because she's able
to mingle with everybody. Rome doesn't know how
 to keep his mouth shut. And he twisted up a bunch
 of words that I told him early this morning
because I was trying to have general conversation
with him. Damn, man. What a dick. I am fired up, buddy. I am feeling froggy
as it gets at this point. -You don't?
-No. I'm still No-vote Kyle. I'm a sitting duck. -I'm gonna crush him.
-Yeah. KYLE:
 So, at this point in time,
all I have is my social skills. I'm fixing to squish him like a bug. I'm just gonna throw it
out there for everybody. -Seriously.
-(Tiyana laughs) I thought-I thought
I had a connection, and now -TIYANA: Wow.
-I find out that he's, like, making it sound like
I threw at you. -Mm-hmm.
-And I'm just like, -"... that."
-TIYANA: Yeah, like, -I'm chopping it immediately.
-SUE: Can I say something, Kyle? He also, this morning
at the beach, told me that you were bashing
Caroline and I. No. And see,
I didn't bash either one of you. What I said was, you have, like,
a mother-daughter relationship. Everybody knows I'm one of

First time getting to see everybody together. We are in the individual portion
of this game. All right, shall we get to it? -(all voicing assent)
-Yes. Let's go. PROBST:
All right, well, typically, this is the part of the game where you compete
in a physically demanding, emotionally challenging course
to determine who will earn the merge meal, who will earn the merge, who will get their Buff, who will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council, who will be vulnerable tonight
at Tribal Council. Good news is
we're still gonna do that. (indistinct murmuring) But with a twist. -Ugh.
-PROBST: Here's how it works. We're still gonna divide
into two teams of six. The winning team
will earn a meal, but it is not a merge meal because winning
the first team challenge does not earn you
a spot in the merge. For that, you will have
to work even harder. The winning six will then
move on to a second challenge, where you will compete
against each other -Oh, my gosh.
-for individual immunity, and the winner of that challenge will earn the individual
immunity necklace. KYLE:
Wow. -Oh!
-Wow. -I love it.
-PROBST: That person will be safe tonight

Bring it over to me. -(clapping)
-SUE: Good job, Genevieve. -Thank you.
-Thank you. All right. So,
this advantage is a good one. Tell you how it works. Genevieve, you do not
have to participate -in this arduous team challenge.
-Yes. Instead, you move directly to
the second individual challenge, where you will have
a one in seven shot at winning this necklace. You have also earned
the food reward. (all exclaiming) Ah! Thank you. All right, let me walk you
through today's challenge. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race through mud and wood shavings until you reach a cage. You'll then use a grappling hook
 to retrieve a large bag containing a ball. You'll then work together to get to the top of a very steep ramp
 to the platform, where two players
 will use that ball and attempt to maneuver it
 through a table maze. The first team of six
to win earns the food and the right to move on
to the next challenge. The losing six--
got nothing for you. -Make sense?
-Yes, sir. PROBST:

different here, as well. We've never done

You got to get it up and over. TIYANA:
Y'all got it. -PROBST: Sol holding it.
-One, two, three. -PROBST: Rome trying to pull it.
-SAM: One more! -Heave!
-PROBST:
Sam bear-hugging it now, trying to do it himself. And he's done it! You're good, Yellow! Go! GENEVIEVE:
Good job! PROBST:
Blue has it! You're good! Go! Got to get everybody down
into your mats. Slide.
You need that bag. Now you got
to get all six players and your bag to the next mat. (overlapping chatter) Yellow working together. -Blue working together.
-Let's go. You're good.
Start untying. Now you got to release that ball -from the bag.
-It's open, it's open,
it's open. Wait, I see it,
I see it, I see it. PROBST:
Yellow has the ball. Blue has their ball. You're good. Go! Yellow gonna take on the ramp. Blue now gonna take on the ramp. If you weren't tired already,
this will do it. -(whooping)
-Gabe not messing around. Immediately gets up, grabs the rope,
and he can now help people up. Here goes Rome. He's got the rope.
There goes Kyle. -There goes Tiyana for Blue.
-SOL: Help her! PROBST:
Kyle gets up now for Yellow. Teeny gives it a go.
It's not gonna happen. That is a very steep ramp. Tiyana falls back down. Another attempt by Sierra. You've got sandbags
if you need 'em. Sol is up for Blue. Most difficult part
of this challenge is getting up -to the table maze.
-SIERRA: Oh! So close, Sue! Sue with another huge effort. -Not a bad idea.
-PROBST: Yellow now gonna
go get their sandbags. You can build a ladder
to help you get up higher, but it takes a lot of energy
to drag those bags over. There goes Tiyana. -She's got the rope!
-(grunting) Can she hang on? (Tiyana grunting) Andy grabbing Tiyana's arm. (whoops) Sierra's up for Yellow. GABE:
Can you pull her all the way up? PROBST: Tiyana is up for Blue,
and we're down to one person left. Here goes Caroline. -(Caroline muttering)
-Aah! Close. Yellow stacking sandbags strategically. You get that high enough, you just reach up
and grab that rope. Gabe coming down.
Gonna give Caroline a hand. Andy being held by Sol and Rome. You got this! All you got! There goes Caroline again. And she's got it. Andy has her. Andy is being held
by everybody else. This is a test of trust right now. Caroline is there. Now it's up to Gabe.
He's already been up there once. Gonna have
to pull himself up again. Blue now looking very good. They can move on to the
table maze. Two tribe members. Yellow's still working
to get up. -They are building a wall
of sandbags.
-ROME: Pick it up? -You-you... you let go.
-It's got to go this way. PROBST:
Gabe and Rome
for Blue on the table maze. Sue is up for Yellow! Yellow's got some momentum now.
Here comes Teeny. That strategy
of sandbags is working. Tiny bit from you. Yeah. You, you, you, you. Rachel's up and over now
for Yellow. Here comes Kyle.
This should be easy for Kyle. -He did it once.
-(whoops) Everybody's up for Yellow.
You're in this. It's gonna be Sam and Kyle
on the maze for Yellow. It's Gabe and Rome for Blue. Okay, not too hard,
not too hard. Slowly and touch. Now it's gonna be
all about touch and working together. Two people is
much more difficult than one. One, you just worry
about yourself. Two, you got to worry about that
other idiot you're playing with. -Guys!
-That was me. We're good,
we're good, we're good. PROBST:
You got to be subtle. Tiny movements
around those obstacles. Okay. Chill, chill, chill. -PROBST:
Blue is all over the place.
-Come on, guys, take your time. Moving with crazy, jerky moves. Rome, you're being... touch
is way too much right now. Sol, Sol, we're good, brother.
I appreciate it, man. -All right.
-We're good.
We got this. Don't worry. PROBST:
Sam and Kyle very steady. They have not changed their
approach the entire challenge. -Blue making huge moves,
-Guys. playing much more carefree. Blue drops,
and they're back to the start. It is now Yellow in the lead. KYLE:
You need to pick up
on your side a little. PROBST: Gabe and Rome drop.
They've got to start again. -Is there a swap-outs?
-No. -Bro, relax, relax.
-All right. My bad. PROBST:
Yellow, slow and steady, getting closer to the center. -Go, go, go, go, go.
-PROBST: There goes Blue again. Aggressive out of the gate.
They've got a pattern. They are quickly
catching Yellow. Sam and Kyle
making more progress. Blue trying to catch them. Blue very close
to catching Yellow. Too close to call right now. KYLE:
So once it goes this way, -I'm-I'm pulling down.
-PROBST: While Yellow is taking their time talking,
Blue is now catching. Now Blue in the lead. This is very close. Both balls
in nearly the same spot. Go! Yellow's in the inner circle. Blue is close
to the inner circle. -Blue drops.
-(cheering) Yellow wins! That's it! -Yeah!
-Wow, what a finish. Within inches of each other. Defeat for Caroline, Tiyana, Gabe, Rome, Andy and Sol. No food, no shot at immunity. What a huge effort in stage one. Wow. All right, you six,
you're now gonna move on to the second challenge. Head down with me. You six, take a spot on the bench,
we'll get this going. SUE:

is winning this. This is the second part
of earn-the-merge. You win this, you win individual immunity, you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council, you will get a Buff, which means
you will be the first person -of Survivor 47
to earn the merge.
-Wow. PROBST:
The stakes are never higher. Who knows what's gonna
happen this afternoon with 13 people in the game? All right, here's how it works. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna stand on a very narrow beam while balancing a ball
 on a wooden bow. At regular intervals, you will
 move farther down the beam, making it more difficult. If at any point you drop
 or your ball drops... ...you're out. Last person left standing wins individual immunity and
everything that comes with it. Losers, you will join
the other six, going to Tribal Council
tonight vulnerable. All right, everybody take
your spots, and we'll get it on. Here we go. All right. Everybody's
in your first position. Place your ball on your bow. Ooh. -My gosh.
-Come on, baby. PROBST:
Wait till everybody's
good and centered, and then I'm gonna call it. All right,
everybody is looking good, and this challenge is on. We'll be in this first section
for five minutes. Genevieve,
as fresh as you can be, given it's day 12 of Survivor. She is not covered in mud,
is not exhausted. -That is the big advantage
Genevieve has.
-Come on. PROBST:
Sierra drops. We are down to six. Sam with a nice save.
Can he get it back? One end to another. No, Sam is out.
You can leave the ball, Sam. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to five. Now it's Rachel
with a little movement, and a nice recovery by Rachel. You cannot lose
your concentration. Whatever it takes
to keep your mind occupied, -that's what
you got to be doing.
-Back to the center. -(Genevieve mumbles)
-PROBST: If you get comfortable, and you start to drift,
so will that ball, and before you know it, you're out, you're on the bench. 15 seconds left. Survive this,
you move to the next stage of this challenge. Get a little more difficult. Five, four, three, two, one. You can grab your ball.
Everybody's safe. -Well done.
-(sighing) You will now move down.
Don't get off the beam. You're gonna move now
down into the next section. -So hot.
-PROBST: This is more narrow. -Scalding.
-PROBST: It's gonna be
a little more difficult. -Ooh. Oh.
-PROBST: All right. Everybody, place your ball. Everybody looking good,
and this challenge is back on. You're gonna be here
for ten minutes, twice as long
as that first section. Teeny with movement,
but a nice recovery. It's tiny little moves
to save that. She's doing it. Genevieve with a nice save. Was nearly off the end,
and she pulled it back. (mouthing) PROBST:
Rachel's ball on the move. She cannot recover. Rachel's out.
We're down to four. Genevieve's ball on the move
again. Can she recover again? Genevieve cannot stop it
this time. Genevieve is out. She earned the advantage
to get the shot. Couldn't capitalize on it. And we are down to three. Kyle locked in. Sue locked in. Teeny locked in. We got a challenge. Little bit of movement by Sue. -Oh.
-PROBST: Teeny,
out of nowhere, drops. She's out. We are down to two-- Kyle versus Sue. They're side by side,
and Sue's ball is on the move. Just 30 seconds left
in this round. If you can survive this round, you get to grab that ball, and you get a fresh start. Kyle's ball hasn't moved
in a long time, but neither had Teeny's
until suddenly, it dropped, and she was out. That's how fast
this challenge will get you. Sue with a lot of movement. Can she hang on
for another ten seconds? PROBST:
Five, four, three, two, one. You're both safe, you move on
to the final round. Nice job. Amazing. All right, Kyle and Sue, move down to that final section. One toe has
to be touching the paint. Balance your ball again. Both of you look really good. This challenge is back on. This is it. Final round, final section. Sue, out of the gate,
ball is on the move, but a nice recovery. Slow, steady moves
is what it takes. TEENY:
Nice. PROBST:
Another nice save by Sue. Wow. PROBST:
Sue trying to get that ball
back under control. She's doing a nice job
of little movements to move it back
toward the center. Kyle with a lot of movement. -ANDY: Ooh.
-PROBST:
Sue with another nice save. And another nice save. -Aah.
-(Survivors groaning)
-Sue can't do it. Sue drops. Kyle wins first
individual community. My moose, my baby boy. -Thank you.
-(whooping) PROBST:
Kyle safe tonight
at Tribal Council, first person
to earn the merge Buff, and will enjoy food
this afternoon. -What a day.
-(cheering, applause) -Slayer.
-Good job, Kyle! Kyle, come on over. -Kyle!
-(whooping) Congratulations. Thanks, bro. First person to wear
the individual immunity necklace -from Survivor 47.
-(Survivors whooping, clapping) -It looks good on you.
-Thank you. With this, you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council. With this, your merge Buff--
go ahead and open it. -Go, Kyle.
-PROBST: This means you are the first person of Survivor 47
to earn the merge. (cheering, applause) -Sick.
-Yay! SIERRA:
Look at that, man. How does that feel? You just went through a lot
to earn that Buff. You know, Jeff,
it feels really good. And, uh, anybody that knows me out here
understands that I'm here for my family
and my kids, and when I give it,
I give it a buck 20, and I do it for my family. PROBST:
Well done. All right, Kyle, safe tonight at Tribal Council, the only person who will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council. To complicate things
a little more, though, Kyle, you, along with Genevieve,
Sam, Sierra, Rachel, Sue and Teeny-- you're all going to enjoy a meal at a separate part of camp. So you will be fueling your body
and you will be bonding, while Gabe, Sol, Caroline, Tiyana, Andy and Rome are at another part of camp
wondering what is going on. And later in the afternoon,
you'll all come together and start to talk. All right, grab your stuff,
head back to camp. See you tonight at Tribal. KYLE:
 I am the first merged member. Huge check mark on Survivor bucket list. Thank you. I'm really excited now that
 I have my name off the table. So everybody's gonna have
 to do some scurrying around. They're gonna have
 to paint their own pictures. And I have a pretty good idea of who the picture's
 getting painted of. When the pressure

Oh, my God! SAM: Walking into the feast is like Thanksgiving afternoon
 when Mom says, "Food's ready," and the football game's
about to kick off. -Charcuterie!
-Charcuterie.
-Look at. Charcuterie. SAM:
 I've been craving charcuterie. Since, like, day three
 out here, I've been asking, "Jeff, get me some meats
and cheeses to put into my belly, please." And so, I see
 this big old platter of salami and pepperoni
 and prosciutto and every cheese that I don't even know the name of,
but I know I want to eat it. SAM:
 I know right away, "You're gonna
make yourself sick, and you're okay with that."
(laughs) Oh, wait.
Should I do my first pineapple? -My first pineapple, Si?
-SIERRA: Mm. Yes! -Yes!
-Let's go. Cheers.
-First pineapple ever. -Cheers. Pineapple!
-SIERRA: Cheers to Pineapple. SUE:
Take a chug. Breaking news.
Sam's a pineapple guy. (cheering) (Teeny laughs) TEENY:
 After a few sips of wine, I was almost impatient in
waiting for somebody to bring up the fact that
we have a vote tonight, and we are all still vulnerable. And even though we pulled out
 this big win, it doesn't mean that one of us might not
be going home tonight. I know the big question,
million-dollar question. -Are you guys saying Rome?
-I'm gonna go with the majority. -I'll vote with everybody else.
-SIERRA: I'm voting majority.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. -I want Rome to go tonight.
-SUE: I'll do Rome. Sitting down at this merge
 feast, there's only one hombre with an immunity necklace,
and that he is me. I don't have a vote tonight,
 but Rome has got to go. Dude's a rat, man. I... You can't trust that ...
for nothing. Okay, so are we all
in agreeance tonight? -SIERRA: Yes.
-SUE: Yes. SAM:
I think everybody here would be very happy
voting Rome tonight. My concern is I would love it
if there was a second name. -Yeah.
-Are you guys okay with Andy? SIERRA:
 Even though Rome is, like, everybody's, like,
number one name that they want to write down
at Tribal Council, we do need to have a backup,
 whether Rome has an idol, whether he plays
 a Shot in the Dark. Andy's somebody
 I've been working with, but he's been sloppy
 throughout this whole game. So it's like, "You know, sure." SAM:
Teeny, I can't have you
getting too drunk here. You got to hold it together -through Tribal for me.
-RACHEL: Yeah. (snorts)
I'm gonna need, like, a buddy. (Sue laughs) TIYANA: It's like
every single crevice is -covered in mud.
-GABE: A wild day. TIYANA:
Biggest Tribal Council ev... Like, damn, that is, like,
an insane twist that he threw. GABE: As opposed to years past in the new era where,
you know, at this stage, you only have six
or seven people vulnerable, everybody except for Kyle, who won individual immunity-- we're all
 on the chopping block tonight. I'm one of those people, so, that's something that is both
 exciting and scary. -'Cause...
-No, stay. Every single person
on this island knows about it, and every single person
will know -what we're doing tonight.
-ANDY: Yeah. ANDY: This three-way, shared amulet--
 it's something that myself, Caroline
and Teeny agreed to take just because we didn't
 all want to lose our votes on that journey
 that we went on together. And so, the best option is
 to get these off of our hands, play 'em in a public way, and we do it tonight, and we go
into the merge with no targets on our back. I'm so happy with Rome. I mean, I think
everybody wants Rome... -ANDY: Right.
-TIYANA: Right. SOL: Earlier, at Lavo, I was struggling with Rome. I don't think
 anyone has meditated out here more than I have, and I've had
 to do it because of Rome. I have the biggest hermit crab
I've ever seen in my life. -CAROLINE: Oh, my God.
-I'm ready to eat. (exclaims) SOL:
 He's a pain in my ass, so, to finally, like, have a chance to take out the Rome show feels like Christmas morning. What are you thinking
for tonight? Oh, my God. I'm trying to think
if it won't be Kyle... ROME: The second that Kyle won
 individual immunity, I knew, "Okay, all the seeds
I've been planting about Kyle? "Ooh! They got to go out
the window, and I got to come up with a new plan." So guess
 who I want out the game? I mean, there's only one person
that's been, like, genuinely mean to me
at different times in this game, and that's Sol. Sol.
So guess what I used? I used one little thing that Sol said
during the challenge today. Did you hear him when, like, -we dropped the ball twice?
-We were, like... Did you hear him yell at me? He tries to be encouraging and all this stuff, but
he literally just makes me feel like such a little person,
like, and it sucks. Yeah.
It's, like, such a... Yeah. 'Cause, like,
I already, like, have... I already have, like,
self-esteem and, like, pride issues with, like, myself
and, like, not being able to do things and, like,
you know, things like that. So when someone's, like, they're
not believing in me, clearly, -it just... it sucks.
-It doesn't help. Yeah. -I don't want
to deal with it anymore.
-I know. ROME:
 I might have shed a little
 crocodile tear here, too,
talking about my pride and how...
how Sol's been demeaning me. So, it was, like...
it was rough. -I didn't want to deal with it.
-TIYANA: Mm-hmm. -I don't want to play
with people like this.
-TIYANA: Yeah. ROME:
 You could tell
 Caroline and Tiyana-- they were like, "Oh, man,
 that's just not right." And as long as I can keep
on playing on people's emotions, I feel like I'll at least
be good to go for tonight. Well, I mean,
we were just trying to hear where his head was at. He said,
"Well, the only person out here who's been mean to me is Sol,
so, I'd like to vote for Sol." -That was it.
-(chuckles) SOL:
 I do not like that Rome
is putting a target on my back. But honestly, I expected it. I mean, he's been
trying to get me out since our first Tribal Council. TEENY:
Hello? -Where are they?
-SOL: Yo. SOL:
 The one thing, though,
 that I have going for me is that Rome's ego is gigantic. And right now, everyone
 is pumping that thing up, and it's getting bigger
and bigger and bigger. Can I give you, like, a big hug? -Of course
you can give me a hug.
-Good. ROME:
 Tonight, you need seven votes to get Sol out of the game.
Kyle does not have a vote tonight. Dude, that immunity necklace
is so cool. I have a damn bat
tattooed on my back. ROME:
 There's also three amulets. We don't know what those three
 amulets are gonna be doing. The only crazy thing
 that I can see happening tonight is those
three amulets playing it on Sol. But Caroline does not like Sol
 at all right now. I'm feeling, like,
at peace with this vote. ROME:
 So I do not see that happening
 whatsoever. It's a good feeling. So, the big thing is
is to get the people that have the influence
down to vote out Sol. Oh, really? Okay, sure. That's one plan. Unbeknownst to Rome, Rome is the other plan. So right now,
the plan is gonna be Sol. Okay. Hey, that's great, Rome. You keep
throwing Sol's name around. Gonna be Sol tonight, so... Yeah. It's looking like
it's gonna be Sol. -Okay. Is everyone on board?
-Mm-hmm. ROME:
I think I might be a little bit of a mastermind right now,
 you know? I got a plan in motion.
I've been setting the seeds. Did you hear about it? -What? Sol?
-Yeah. The fact there's 13 people
 in the game and I can corral this many people
to vote my way? That must say a lot
about how I'm playing the game. GENEVIEVE:
 You guys all heard the real plan? -Yes. Okay.
-Perfect. Yeah. And I actually feel like
Rome is comfortable. Yeah, I feel like
he's comfortable, too. GENEVIEVE:
They did a lot of work today. We did.
We friggin' babied him. Thank you. -(laughing): I love you.
Stop it.
-Thank you. -Right.
-Thing is,
does he have anything? And if he does? And if he does,
we need something else. -I appreciate this.
-(laughing): Yeah. Rome's coming. ROME:
 Tonight is about sending a message to Sol,
 letting him know that I won the war. Everyone's voting Rome, and then Sol is voting Andy. ROME:
 It's all good. I'm gonna be feasting on Sol's bones tonight. ROME:
 I got a big old smile
on my face because it's feeling like everything's
gonna be rolling my way. Okay. Cool. ROME:
 Man, like, I am
 running this game. This ain't even
 Magic versus Larry. This is Michael Jordan versus Kirk Hinrich, all right?
This is... this is not even a competition
right now, all right? I'm playing this game
on a whole 'nother level. I'm on Survivor, baby, and
 I'm leading a mastermind vote at a potential historic
 Tribal Council. It might be a Rome game or a home game,
 and, Sol, I'm sorry, it might be
a home game for you, buddy. To 5 0 ye ar s wi th m y be st f ri en d. [SFX: Gasp] [SFX: Spilling sound] Nooo... Aya... Quick,

talk about the twists. Only one person is safe at the merge vote. Andy, what did you see
this afternoon? 'Cause I'm guessing
everybody thought it's a lot more dangerous. ANDY:
Yeah. I mean,
there's just this insecurity, a little bit.
There's just, like... You just want to be safe.
You want that pretty, pretty purple Buff.
Everyone wants that. And so, we're all trying to portray that

one minute, and then -we all came back,
and it was, like...
-For one minute?! I mean, it was...
it was surprising, like... -Pretty much.
-RACHEL: There's a few people that were concerned we were
gonna let you down, Jeff. Taking notes, but not let down. So, Rome, is it possible advantages are starting
to be seen as disadvantages? Well, the amulet is for sure... seemed like a disadvantage. That's why the people
with the amulets tonight are gonna be getting rid of it
and getting it out of the game, -because...
-My heart is breaking. So, you don't think
that's a good advantage? -No, they... I'm...
-School me. Maybe you should
be sitting here. If you want to trade
for tonight, I... Rome, come over and sit here. (all exclaiming) Tell the group--
and I will listen-- why the Amulet Advantage
is not good. All right, so, we've got an Amulet Advantage
out there right now. We know that three people have the amulet.
They all went on a journey together.
Usually when you go on journeys, when you come back, you tell
your whole tribe what happened.
So everyone knows who has the amulets right now. And everyone knows that the
amulet by itself has no power. You have to use it together -with the other two people.
-I mean... So, the only options is, target the other two people so that you have all the power
with the amulet, or say, "Hmm, I don't want
to be one of the two targets. "Let me just go ahead and
get rid of this thing right now. "We'll use it together. -That way we don't have
a target on our back."
-Wow. And I think that, as a group, sums up the Amulet Advantage
right now in the game. Well done. Well done.
Get back over there. Get back over there. -Wow.
-TEENY: That was great. -That was better said than...
-PROBST: Duly noted. Thank you. That was awesome,
being able to sit there. You know, like, I love hosting, I love commentating, and you literally have my dream job,
so the fact I even got to do that for 30
seconds right there, that just made the...
That meant the world to me, man. Seriously, I'm about to cry.
Like, that was... -Really?
-Yeah, seriously. Like, that was...
that was a lot. I appreciate it.
Thank you, man. PROBST:
Well, I don't want
to make light of it because I know
this is a great job. I have the best job
I'll ever have in my life. Rome, I know.
And I hope you're not coming for it,
even though... I'd love to be your protégé
one day, man. I'd love it. -All right, for now,
we'll stick to playing.
-Yeah. PROBST:
And I'm-I'm glad we had that. We'll talk later. Yeah. All right.
Gabe, let's talk about the deliciousness
of a blindside, because everybody here has been involved
in a blindside this season, either as one of the architects or as somebody who was
on the wrong side of it -and survived it.
-GABE: Well, an interesting word
that you used in that question
was "architect," right? When it comes to blindsides,
it's not important for me to be the architect
of a blindside, necessarily. What's important to me is that I know
where the votes are going. PROBST:
Rome, where do you stand
on blindsides? I think blindsides
are really only fun when you're in on the vote. When you witness it
and you weren't part of the blindside, you can
feel blindsided yourself. Andy, how about for you? Blindsiding Anika
was fun as hell, dude. It was super fun.
It was the most fun I've had out here because, you know,
my name's been in her mouth since day one, since day two. And so, to see her shock,
it just shows it was a job well done. PROBST:
All right. So, Caroline, tonight's vote is big because you want
to make the merge. Why is that significant? CAROLINE:
When I am watching the show,
and you hear the confessionals of people
talking about the merge, everyone says,
"This is where the game starts. "This is where
you separate okay players from great players." And the stakes are so high
'cause we're all itching and craving
and wanting that experience. Andy, you were nodding. Every single day out here
is a lesson, is a gift, is its own adventure. I don't want
to minimize that experience if I lose out tonight. But when you think about
the legacy of Survivor, you're like,
"Oh, I'm a pre-merger." Like, that's your identity. And so, you want
to be known as someone who made an impact in this game,
and it starts tonight. And if you just miss out,
you're going to feel the FOMO. PROBST:
All right, well, one thing seems
very clear to me. Tonight's vote is gonna be
great news for 12 people... (laughter) ...devastating for one person. GABE:
Hot take. It is time to vote.
Andy, you're up. (speaking German) Come on, now. Don't ever
put my name out like that. They say
Rome wasn't built in a day, but your game
sure was destroyed in one. I think everybody
has finally caughten up to the way
that I feel about you. Oh, man. I just don't want Sol
on the jury, 'cause I know
he'd never vote for me. Dude can't stand me, so, Sol, I know it's already
gonna be you tonight, so I'm gonna
shake things up a bit. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. CAROLINE:
Jeff? I have one I'd like to play. Other people as well? -Yes.
-Wonderful. Ah. TEENY:
Would you like to be our spokesperson? Sure. All right. Assuming everyone
who has an amulet agrees, I would love to play
my amulet for Teeny. -Agreed.
-Yes. All right. TEENY:
Yeah, I can't say "no" to that. CAROLINE:
Plot twist. Thank you. These are the three amulets that, when played together for the same person,
do form an idol. Any votes cast
for Teeny will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Andy. One vote Sam,
one vote Andy. Andy. That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam. Rome. That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam, one vote Rome. Rome. We're tied.
Two votes Andy, two votes Rome, one vote Sam. Rome. That's three votes Rome,
two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Rome.
That's four votes Rome, two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Rome. That's five votes Rome, two votes Andy, one vote Sam. Sixth person voted out
of Survivor 47: Rome. That's six, that's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. -Good game, you guys.
-Sorry, Rome. -Good game, man.
-Good game, Rome.
-Sorry. Good game. Just want to say thank you guys
all for the experience. It was awesome getting
to play with you all. Got to live out a dream. I got to sit in your seat. It's all love for all you guys.
You guys don't got to worry about nothing.
I appreciate you all, man. Thank you. Rome, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Can I get a hug?
-Course. -TIYANA: Aw.
-(Genevieve laughs) (applause) You got it. All right, you guys, all love,
man. I appreciate you all. -I have something for you.
-(all exclaiming) (Sierra gasps) -(squeals)
-PROBST: Congratulations. You have made the merge. (cheering) -Pass it around,
pass it around. Oh.
-PROBST: Take a Buff and put it on. CAROLINE:
Guys, let's go. TIYANA:
Oh, it's gorgeous. SIERRA:
It smells really good. -SUE: We made the merge, guys.
-SIERRA: We made it. -Yes!
-Wow. -Yes!
-PROBST: Congratulations. Now grab your torches.
Head back to camp. The game continues. -GABE: Come on.
-PROBST: Good night. -Good night, Jeff.
-Good night, Jeff. Captioning sponsored by
