Sam said that you're the backup. ANDY:
 I need to flip the switch. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... We're gonna randomly divide
into two groups of six. SAM:
 I think Lavo and Gata--
 we have some level of trust. We are five Tuku strong. So, we have
 an easy vote out tonight. This gives someone
 the opportunity to have safety without power. (laughs) PROBST:
All right. It is time to vote. Jeff? "Announce that you have the
Safety without Power Advantage. "You will leave
Tribal Council immediately. You cannot be voted out." Tuku five, you will
be turning on each other. Seventh person voted
out of Survivor 47: Tiyana. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ All right, well. Coming back
 to camp completely alone, my head is just spinning,
 honestly. Like, on the one hand, I am just breathing the largest sigh of relief because I'm here
 and I'm in the game. But at the same time,
 it's not great to have, kind of,
 the spotlight on me, and I hope that I didn't piss anybody off. RACHEL:
 I'm feeling anxiety
 and relief, but still nervousness.
 But also, there's a huge question
of who gave me this advantage. -I know.
-Marco. Polo. -Rachel.
-RACHEL: Sorry, guys. -What a move tonight.
-RACHEL: Oh, my God. (overlapping chatter) Thank you. GABE:
Tribal did not go good tonight. You know, Rachel is
 a very threatening player. I was very excited
for her to leave tonight. (grunts) GABE:
 But she forced the Tuku five to cannibalize itself in front of everybody at Tribal. So, this was quite a disaster. -Safety without Power is crazy.
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
And it was, like,
a genuine shock. TEENY: Yeah. I would love to know
where it came from, but I'm just happy I had it. SOL:
 I was the one
 who gave Rachel the advantage, and nobody knows about it
 because I've been playing this act out here
 that I'm kind of goofy. So, people don't that I'm really
a really strategic guy. We moved back to Michigan.
My dad didn't want to be in Thailand that far away
from us, so he moved to Texas. But he owned
a video store down there. -Just as immigrants. Yeah.
-My mom owned
a liquor store. Yeah. -Um, like, my...
-Why do all Asians
always own a store? I gave the advantage
 to Rachel because she was, what I felt,
in jeopardy. Big, big trouble
at Tribal Council. But also, genuinely,
 there is a connection there. And I'm working on building the SSAs-- Sol's Secret Agents. When you got up and left,
they were all freaking out, -like, "Oh, damn."
-Really? Your ass was gone. And... Literally, the second
I found it, I was like, -"It was Sol." Yeah, I knew it.
-Yeah. RACHEL:
 Sol saved my life. You know, in this game,
 no one has to help anybody else out,
 but he was looking out for me, period. You have somebody now, okay? -Clearly, I want
to work with you.
-Yeah. But I definitely don't
want it to come out because that's a target on me. -All right.
-Thank you so much. RACHEL:
 I'm so excited
 for this budding relationship. I finally have someone
 that I can look at and be like, "I think at least for now, I could trust you."
(laughs) One million percent,
you were going. They were all playing me. It was very clear
that they were, -like, planning
on staying together.
-That's wild. I know you had
a really hard day, so I'd hate to tell you
how good of a day we had, but we had a really,
really good day, and... With Lavo. Oh, my God. Okay. You... Well... -Okay, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
-(laughs softly) SAM:
 At this point,
 I don't trust Tuku as far as I can throw 'em. So the Gata-Tuku War is absolutely coming,
and I want to make sure that I'm on the right side of
 the numbers when it gets here. ♪ ♪ Holy crap, dude. -Kemo sabe.
-Hey, Mr. Miyagi. Dude, some people on my tribe
have never seen The Karate Kid. And I'm like, "Wax on, wax off."
They're like, "What?" -I'm like, "No."
-Are you serious? I'm like, "Please, no." KYLE: I like Sol.
 You know, Sol might actually be, like, my favorite person
out here at this point. He's a jokester.
 He's got a beautiful smile. -Look at that.
-That's primo.
That was one swipe. One swipe. Oh! (coughs) Ah. CAROLINE:
 Hello, hello. Everyone, I have something
I'm really excited -to show you all.
-(Genevieve gasps) I was going on a walk
for a little bit, and I saw something
kind of interesting. -I think
we should all get going.
-Ah, field trip. SUE:
Lead the way, Caroline. Oh, even the suspense
is killing me, honestly. -Oh, my God.
-Get out. -CAROLINE: Here it is.
-SUE: Get out. Oh. (laughs) -Y'all cool if I read it? Okay.
-(all voice assent) (cheering, screaming) CAROLINE: I see that word
 "auction," and, like, my heart explodes
and I can't believe I get to be a part of, like, one of the biggest
 bucket-list items. Oh, my gosh. Breaking news from
the islands of Survivor 47. A Survivor icon is back. It's the auction. The players are fired up,
 running around the jungle, collecting their money, ready
 to go to eat some good food. -Oh.
-Oh, nice! Thank you. Oh. Oh. No. I'm so far. I hate running, but, like,
 I want food, so I need money. So I'm just repeating to myself
the things I want to eat. Yes. Seems like the water wall
would be... Got one. Oh, nice. Hey, bro. There we go. Bingo. Bingo! I haven't gotten
 a single food reward yet. Everything I've eaten so far
has come from the sand. GABE:
 So I'm hungry. Ooh. I'm gonna get some steak. I'm gonna get a burger.
I'm gonna get something good. Like, I want
 to make this money count. ♪ ♪ Dude, I have one. Potato salad. Potato salad. (sighs) I got you. It's like an Easter egg hunt.
 I've been good at Easter egg hunts my entire
 life. I mean, my family-- we've had Easter parties
 every single year. Oh, yay. And I truly, to be honest,
I didn't stop Easter egg hunting until last year.
I was like, "I got to retire." But I'm, like,
 going hard out here. Oh, my God. Sierra. I'm live from
the islands of Survivor 47. We're about halfway through
the search for the cash here. The players are all
 going very nuts. Uh, so far, Andy in last place and Sierra,
 a surprise early favorite, racking up lots of dough. Oh. (grunts softly) How's it going, Andy? -Hold on. Let's see.
-I just need one. I feel myself in a hole. A panic sets in, and I just have
 to tell myself, like, "Okay, I'm just looking
 for tubes in the jungle." I can do that. I have my eyes.
They work fine. At this point,
 I just have to laugh. At this point,
 I recognize what... I'm on Day 14. Like,
this is how it's going for me. I just want to make sure
I don't get zero. No. All right, we're catching up. ANDY:
 With more time passing, fewer tubes
 are gonna be available. It's scary
 because you can sort of feel the time running out. Cool. ANDY:
 And you really don't want
 to be left without any money. You don't want to be broke at the Survivor auction
before you even get there. SOL:
Andy, that's it. -SIERRA: We found 'em all.
-SAM: That's it. And that's a wrap from
the Survivor 47 money hunt. Sierra comes out on top,
with Andy in dead last, as usual. (indistinct chatter) Six, seven. $140. -SIERRA: $340.
-GABE: $280. GENEVIEVE: Yeah. KYLE:
 For a guy that
 only found two tubes, I got, like, 580 bucks here. That's more money

-(whoops) PROBST:
We got room for everybody. Let's have some fun today. Welcome to the Survivor auction
for Survivor 47. (cheering, whooping) This is a new-era auction, so let me remind you
how it works. This morning,
you had a money scramble where you raced into the jungle to try and find various amounts
of cash. The reason
for the money scramble is you all start the auction
with varying amounts of money. So let's take a look
at who got what. (cheering) All right, most money: Sierra. $1,060. And it goes down from there
all the way to Andy. Good news is, Andy,
you're not gonna lose your vote. You got to have
the most amount of money -at the end of the auction
to lose your vote.
-Yes. You don't have any money.
Bad news is, -you cannot bid on any items.
-Yup. PROBST:
So let's get to the items. We have 15 items
prepared for you today. But only the first five
are guaranteed. -GENEVIEVE: Ugh.
-PROBST: The additional number of items
will be determined by me drawing a random number -out of a bag
between six and 15.
-Wow. The reason this matters is the auction will end
without warning, and whoever has the most money at that point in the auction
loses their vote at the next Tribal Council. PROBST:
Let's see how many items
we're gonna have. Okay. I know the total number
of items that's going to be in the auction.
You don't. -So that's been determined.
-Oh, my goodness, buddy. The question is
how many items will there be? -Okay.
-Shall we get this auction going? -(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: All right. GENEVIEVE: Oh, no. -Ugh.
-PROBST: First item. First $60 buys it. -$60.
-$60 to Sol. Come on up. (whooping, cheering) Salted potato chips,
soft drink for 60 bucks. That might be the best buy
of the day. -Yeah, I think so.
-$60. -Ooh, want me
to try this, buddy?
-Try these for me, Sol. Oh, you got it, baby. RACHEL: Oh, that's a big bowl. -That's a big bowl.
-That's a big bowl. GENEVIEVE:
That's a big bowl. -(whooping, cheering)
-Oh, my God. Yeah, buddy. Ugh. That potato chip
right there was so money. -PROBST: Enjoy.
-SOL: Thank you so much. -(whooping)
-Attaboy, Sol. -PROBST: Let's update the board.
-Thank you, thank you. Sol goes from $600 to $540. All right,
shall we get the next item? (all voicing assent) All right. Next item up for bid: mac and cheese. -All my money. All my money.
-Oh! -$640.
-Damn it! PROBST:
$640. The first bid by Teeny. Teeny, you're gonna spend
all your money on this? I like mac and cheese. -$640. Sold to Teeny.
-GENEVIEVE: Ugh. -Come on up.
-Yay! RACHEL:
Good job, Teeny. Here you go, dude. It's all right.
There's more coming. -Dip in. Have a bite of that.
-Oh, my God. KYLE:
That's a big bowl, man. SIERRA:
Oh, my gosh. Good, Teeny. (laughing, whooping) PROBST: Worth the money? -Absolutely.
-All right, take it back. -Enjoy.
-Thank you. -PROBST:
Mac and cheese for Teeny.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God. Wow. Oh, my God. Ugh. (sighs) PROBST:
If only she could share. Shall I get another item? -(all voicing assent)
-All right. I'm sorry, guys. -(indistinct chatter)
-SIERRA: Okay. Okay. Oh. -I think
there's a drink in there.
-PROBST: The question is am I walking gingerly
because I'm worried about protecting
an amazing reward or am I walking gingerly -to sucker you in?
-SOL: Oh... PROBST: That's the question
you're gonna contemplate as you bid
on this covered item. -$360.
-$360 to Sam. $560.
-$560 to Kyle. -$800.
-$800 to Sierra. PROBST: That's it. Sierra. Sold for $800. Come on up. -TEENY: That's good, Sierra.
-PROBST: See what you bought. -Give me the dough first.
-Okay. PROBST:
All right. This is what $800 bought you. -(all exclaiming)

Chips, salsa, guac
and a margarita. Where do you want to start? Oh, the margarita. Oh, my God. Cheers, guys. -(cheering, whooping)
-Mmm. -Don't spill it, now.
-SIERRA: Oh, no! I am having a margarita

if you apply to be on Survivor. -It's, like, I want
to just take a picture.
-Do it. -Do a selfie.
-I know. I will. Like, if I could
seriously just be, like... -Yeah, here we go.
-(laughing) PROBST:
All right, take it back. Enjoy. -(whooping, cheering)
-(squeals) SOL:
Oh, my God. Look at that guac. That leaves you with $260. -I'm using my best
acting skills
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. -That's what I'm worried about.
-trying to sucker you into not knowing if that's
a really great item or not. I think we got
to keep it covered again. -$80.
-PROBST: 80 from Gabe. -$560 for Kyle.
-PROBST: $560 to Kyle. -Going once.
-Uh, I didn't like
your acting job, Jeff. I'll let Kyle, uh,
take the cover off. -PROBST: Let's find out.
-Hey, Jeff? Uh, if there's meat under there, Kyle's not gonna be able
to eat it. Can I give you my $360 -on the shot that there's meat?
-Uh-uh. Uh-uh. This is one item. No sharing. Sold to Kyle. -Go, Kyle!
-TEENY: $560. PROBST:
All right, talk to me about the meat issue.
Sam said as long -as it's not meat, you're good.
-KYLE: Yeah. So, that's... You know,
I've been a vegan for, like, six plus years, and then
I switched to vegetarian not long ago just so that way, if I had the opportunity
to be here, I could have more options
available to me. That was part of why
you changed your diet, -was on the chance
you might get on Survivor? -(chuckles) -Wow!
-Oh, my God. -GENEVIEVE: Ugh.
-PROBST: It's very interesting, everything you just said,
because your reward comes with dairy,
and there is some meat. Here's what you bought. (all exclaiming) PROBST:
A giant tray of buffalo wings... -Look at all those.
-TEENY: Oh, my God. PROBST:
...with ranch
and some celery and carrots. You know, this is horrible. Yeah.
So you're gonna take this back. There's no sharing of items. -Nobody can buy a buffalo wing
from you.
-Okay. KYLE:
I'll just take it all, you know. -PROBST: All right.
-Yeah. I would have liked that. Thank you, sir. (sniffing) Oh, you're thinking about it. Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna do it. If you're gonna do it,
let me see. All right, so my favorite
was always the wing, right? Oh, he's going for it. -This is a moment.
-(all exclaiming) My heart's pounding right now. -Really?
-Yeah, I'm... Well, why are you doing it? -I'm hungry.
-Okay. That feeling like you're about
to do something, and that something
might be wrong. -(whooping)
-SUE: Good job, Kyle. SAM:
Yay, Kyle. -(Probst laughs)
-It's turned me into an animal. How is it? I'm a little d-disappointed
in myself for caving, but if you're gonna cave,
this is a place to do it. -GENEVIEVE: Yeah.
-Good job, Kyle.
-PROBST: Enjoy. PROBST:
Kyle left with $20. -Let me get another item.
-SUE: Oh, my God. -Look how many there are.
-(sighs) (British accent):
Well, if I had ever been in Shakespeare in the park, -this is how I would do it.
-(laughing) Sir, I present
to you the most beautiful of Survivor auction items. I don't know what's in here.
If you don't like it, I'm merely the messenger. $660. (regular accent):
$660 to Gabe. -Gabe buys it. Sold to Gabe.
-Go, Gabe. -SAM: Good job. Good job.
-Oh, good luck, Gabe. For all the money he has. So the good news is
you can't lose your vote. Well, if you're having
a bad feeling, you can trade it. Oh, Gabe. -SUE: Yikes.
-PROBST: For this. Yeah. -Sticking with the fish guts.
-Sticking with the fish guts? Okay. What you bought was... a very fresh... coconut filled with very cold water. -Oh, no, Gabe.
-PROBST: All of your money. (sighs)
Makes me stronger. SUE:
Sorry, Gabe. -(overlapping chatter)
-Just like that, $660 gone. PROBST: From this point forward, any item could be the last item, which means
if it is the last item, whoever has the most money after
that item loses their vote. Sixth item in the auction. -$380.
-$380 to Sue. -$540.
-540 to Sol. Come on up, Sol.
Sold to Sol for $540. He got the first item. This is his second item
in the auction. Take that from you. This is what $540
bought you, Sol. -SIERRA: Oh, you were right!
-SOL: Oh, my God. PROBST:
A giant apple pie, whipped cream,
which I will let you put on. I got the wrong item, dude. -PROBST: Put the 47 on there?
-SOL: 47, baby. -PROBST: Doesn't have
to be pretty. That looks good.
-Yeah. -What's this?
-Well, this $60, Sol. It's called the Survivor cash-back program. Some items come -with money
that go back to you.
-(all exclaiming) -So you will go back with $60.
-Right. Before you do that,
take a bite of the pie. Oh, yeah. That's how you eat a pie
on Survivor right there. -How delicious is it?
-PROBST: Wow.
-SOL: Oh, man. Take it back.
Take your money back. Enjoy. (whooping) PROBST:
So, Solomon is still in it. If that was the last item,
Rachel, with $500, you would have the most money
and you would lose your vote. Okay. -There is another item.
-SIERRA: Yay. -Yeah.
-SUE: Yay! RACHEL:
Ooh! -Oh, my God.
-Oh, wow. Next item up for bids
will remain covered. -$500, Jeff.
-$500 to Rachel. Come on up. Rachel, out of the
possibility of losing her vote, which may be
the most important thing. $500. Thank you. -What's your feeling right now?
-I have a feeling it could be bad, but
I also have a feeling that... -It could be good?
-There might... I might... For whatever reason,
when you came out, I was like, "I think
there's a burger in there." Wow. (cheering) PROBST:
How does this happen? I feel like I should
take a bite, probably. Yes, take a bite. Take a bite. PROBST:
That's a Survivor burger
right there. -TEENY: Oh, my God.
-SIERRA: Get in there. Oh, my God. -GENEVIEVE: Hey, Rachel.
-PROBST: All right. Take it back and enjoy. Wow. -Well done manifesting.
-Oh, my God. -I just, like, felt it.
-PROBST: All right. Genevieve, at $440... ...you have the most buying
power right now in the auction, if there's another item. If there is not another item
and that was it, you will lose your vote
at tonight's Tribal Council. There is another item -in this auction.

-PROBST: Fish eyes. Oh! (indistinct chatter) (cheering, exclaiming) PROBST:
Wow. That's how you do it
on Survivor, Caroline. Item number 12. -$260.
-Sierra, come on up. See what you bought. You are going to... -share.
-(cheering) You and two other players
will have three minutes to eat. SIERRA:
Gabe and Caroline,
come up and join me. All right, let's do it. Big handfuls of peanut butter, -chunks of chocolate.
-(Sierra groans) This is one of my favorite
things to watch on this show. Oh, I'm going back in. -TEENY: Oh, my God.
-GABE: Yeah! That is it.
This item is over. GENEVIEVE:
Oh, good job. PROBST:
Well done. An impressive attack on
the peanut butter and chocolate. ANDY:
Well done. Well done. PROBST:
Here's where we stand now. Sam is in the lead right now
at $160. So, Sam, if that was
the last item, $160 means you will not vote
at the next Tribal Council. That was the last item
of the auction. The Survivor auction is over. Grab your stuff and head out. Survivor continues. Thank you... so much. -SIERRA: So good.

'cause I was right above you. SAM:
 It sucks losing your vote. Your vote is your voice in the game. And now, with 11 people left, I can't say,
 "You got my vote, man." I just have to say,
"Sure, you have my blessing." RACHEL: At the auction,
 inside the fries was a note that I desperately want to read,
but I'm very scared to take out because
 there's people everywhere. But I finally get a moment
 where I'm going to check on my clothes
 at the clothesline, and I have a moment to myself. Oh, my God. Okay. Wish I would have known that
last night when I was alone in the shelter. Oh, my God. This is the auction jackpot. Like, I couldn't
have scored better. I have been down and out
 Tribal after Tribal. So an idol would give me the most power
that I could possibly have in this game right now. But there's two tarps
 at this camp. Is it at the top? Am I gonna
 have to, like, climb a tree to get to the corner
 of this tarp? My mind is just going nuts. So, I walk by it
 and kind of do, like, a... a little corner check
 and I see a tiny little lump in the corner of the tarp. Definitely it.
 There's something in there, but my brain is reeling on how I'm ever
gonna get this idol. I can't just, like,
 slash the tarp, because there are people at camp at all times, like,
mingling around the shelter. TEENY:
I want you to try
and braid my hair for funsies. I'm thinking business
on the sides, party in front. SIERRA:
 Sam and I-- we are, like, a very strong alliance
and, like, a duo out here. So him losing his vote--
 it's a little scary at this time in the game. We know we have four members
 of Gata, but obviously, you think of the numbers. We need to recruit more. And it just came naturally
with Lavo. Like, I feel great with them,
 I feel great connections. So let's work together and knock out Tuku one by one. I think we have
all formed, like, a great bond with all
of you, like, from Lavo. Like, you, Sol -and, um, Genevieve.
 -TEENY: Genevieve. SIERRA:
 So it's, like, I don't want to break any of that right now. RACHEL:
What, uh, so, what's our plan? Are we just Lavo and Gata? -I would love that.
-SIERRA: I know.
I think right now, we're like,
"Let's just knock out Tuku." Well, there is a part of me,
also, that would love to, you know,
if we're getting Tukus, for it to be the male Tukus. SIERRA: I think if Kyle loses
in an immunity challenge, -like, that has
to be our first target.
-TEENY: Yeah. TEENY:
 I think the Gata and the Lavo people have kind of formed
this alliance together. And the name that we're all throwing around
 right now is Kyle because he's won the past two
 individual immunities. So, if Kyle loses
 the next challenge, he'd be the easy decision. GENEVIEVE:
I want to catch you and Caroline specifically up on yesterday,
and I'd love, if you don't mind, to catch up on what I missed
with you guys. Um... SUE:
You didn't miss much.
We were so focused on... -Was it gonna be Rachel?
-Yeah. Yeah. That would have been good. GENEVIEVE:
 Right now, I believe Teeny is trying to work
 with the former Gata members. We all know they're so charismatic,
they're so big and strong. But they are the most dangerous
 to me on this beach. So, I'd like to shake things up
 and steer the next vote towards one
of the former Gata members. GENEVIEVE:
I think Sam is charming. But I do not want to sit
with him at the end. -CAROLINE: No.
-SUE: Mm-hmm. But I'd like to keep some
of those obvious targets around. -You know what I mean?
-Yes. I don't know how
you guys feel about that, but I'm almost inclined to... target, like, Rachel over Sam. Yes. Genevieve is a smart cookie. She is planting the seeds
 for a big move against Gata. And I'm like, "Damn,
that's what I wanted to do." That's exactly what
I wanted to do. Go, Genevieve. -It's more under the radar.
 -GENEVIEVE: Yes. It's more under the radar. CAROLINE:
 Genevieve and I see Gatas are way too charismatic
and have way much control, and one of them has to go. Sam is an obvious choice, but Rachel is the sneaky,
dangerous one. GENEVIEVE:
I was, like, scratching my hand. I thought I was so tan, and then
I just scratched it off, -and I'm pale.
-(laughs) It's just dirt. I really want to get the idol. Unfortunately, this camp has not
been empty since I got the clue. But there was this point where almost everybody was
 in the shelter. They were all chitchatting, and I was like,
"I think this is my chance." I am looking around, trying not to look suspicious. I don't want anybody
 to know about it. I want that power
to stay with me. I don't want it to be exposed. I flipped up the edge
 of the tarp so I could do it from underneath so no one
 could see that it was ripped. Oh, oh, oh. RACHEL:
 My heart is racing. I'm freaking out.
 I'm trying to get through it. I don't know how long
 it's gonna take. (indistinct chatter in distance) RACHEL:
 Oh, my God. I got it. Look at this guy. Survivor bucket list. I genuinely can't believe
 I pulled it off in broad daylight
 in front of a lot of people. Last night, I was seconds
 from being voted out, and now, I'm holding a... an idol
that nobody knows about. That is the epitome of, like,
 a Survivor turnaround. ♪ ♪ Your pain shouldn't be

immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're
 gonna hold on to a handle connected to a bucket

You'll hear some clicking. This challenge is on. KYLE:
Oh, my gosh. I already feel slippy. PROBST:
You are now holding a quarter of your pregame body weight. The good news is,
your odds are a lot better with one man and one woman. But still, this requires
a lot of willpower. And already, Sam is struggling. Come on, Sam. Sam, you got it. PROBST:

to drop a little bit. Stop. PROBST:

Odds just got a little better. -Oh.

-Damn. PROBST:
We're less than one minute

back up. Can he do it? Gabe. No. Gabe is out.
Take a spot on the bench. We are down to three men
and three women. Two immunity necklaces
on the line, one for each. Caroline readjusting again.
That bucket dropping. Can Caroline get it back up? She's trying to make a move. TEENY:
Nice work, Caroline. SIERRA:
Nice work, Caroline.
Push through. You got it. PROBST:
Caroline holding it off
right now. You never know

you've won individual immunity. -You're good.

Nice going, Andy!
Come on, Andy! We're now looking for one more.
It is Andy versus Kyle. Kyle's won it twice. Andy would like
to break that streak right now and be safe tonight at Tribal. You can't drop now. Dig in. Find that gear
you're looking for. Bleed, whatever it takes

Andy digging back in. Gonna try to wrench it back up.
Can he do it? -No way.
-SOL: Nice job, dude.
-PROBST: And he is. Andy getting that bucket
back up there. Uses a little strength
to do that. It gives you a little
more margin for a slip later. (grunting) (laughing):
Ow. PROBST:
Kyle's dropped a little bit. Andy now dropping again. Andy trying to pull it back up.
Can he do it? -There's a little bit of yes.
-Yes, you can.

Andy drops,
Andy's out of the challenge. Kyle wins his third individual immunity challenge, safe tonight

-Yeah, hug me. I love a hug. Sue,
individual immunity is yours. Guaranteed a spot

-So... If you're just... Like,
how would this even be possible? Because I got a bunch
of warriors over here. So it really feels good,
but I just kept telling myself. I kept channeling all
the strength of my whole family, knowing that everyone
at home is rooting for me. And they'll be so proud
of me doing this. -PROBST: Well done.
-Thank you. That was definitely possible
'cause it happened. You are safe tonight,

they're happy for me, but I know everybody here
is gonna want me out, especially now. This is my third
 immunity win in a row. (chuckles)
So, as you can imagine out here, I'm really creating a name
 for myself. This is not good. It's good for me today, but it could be
the death of me tomorrow. SAM: With Kyle and Sue
off the table and safe, Gabe is, by far, a bigger threat than Caroline is
 at this point in the game. Here is my only thought. -I'm a little bit
more scared of Gabe.
-Same. -Yeah.
-RACHEL: Do you think
we need to split or do you think
we should just keep it clean? I think we can keep it clean. SAM: Yeah. SOL:
Okay. SAM:
The Gata-Lavo alliance has been a very natural and easy thing
 for all of us. And before you know it, there ain't gonna
be any more Tuku left. I feel like I was, like... I just wanted
to catch up with you guys. -Yeah.
-And it sounds like... -I feel a little behind,
that's all.
-Yeah. You know, Andy has just been somebody we're...
we've been keeping around 'cause he's still
 in Sam and I's pocket. He's just, like, an easy number
 that we could use. He's not a threat,
 he's not somebody I'm worried about in the game. So I'm, like, you know,
might as well drag him along a little longer until, you know,
we can no longer tolerate him. But we just want to make sure -that you're still strong
with us.
-I am. -And, like, that we still
have you locked in.
-Yeah. -You swear?
-Yes, that is...
I swear, that is... -I'm still your island sister?
-Island sister, yeah. Sam and Sierra still feel like they own me, and they have me
in their pockets. They look at me
 as an expendable piece, and as sort of a weak player. SIERRA:
 He came over to me,
 and he was like, "I'm having a really bad day,"
and I'm, like... I just feel like the guy's had
a series of bad days. -It's really sad.
-I know. ANDY:
 And so, for me, that's
 enough to just cut bait. Like, goodbye. I feel like this is my, like, She's All That makeover moment. I'm starting this game
just like, "Oh, hi, I'm Andy.
Like, please like me. "Um, Sierra and Sam,
 like, you're the cool kids. Like, can you... can I sit
 at your lunch table?" And now I'm at the merge. And I'm getting a lot cooler
 and, like, I don't need to wear these freaking glasses
 anymore, and I could be... the Andy that
I believe myself to be. I could be my full version
of myself. And I can turn into the pivotal
player in this post-merge. Sam and Sierra. -And so...
-You don't have
to work with them anymore. -(laughs)
-Let's do it. -Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah. It's looking really good. ANDY:
 I can make my own lunch table.
 Sam, Sierra and Rachel-- they're gonna be
 shocked by the new Andy. They're not gonna
 see me coming, and... that was stupid. (laughs) Like, I've been doing a lot. I've been doing a lot
behind their backs. I feel like I'm a Lavo. I love hearing that. ANDY:
 I want to build an alliance
 with myself, Lavo and Tuku, and I think splitting up Sam and Sierra
is of the utmost importance. They're gonna be like,
"Damn, Andy did that. Our Andy? Wait, no.
He was gonna be our goat." -I'm looking to change my fate.
-Yeah. Just have a number of people
who we're actually working with. -Yeah. That's awesome.
-Yeah. We can just line 'em up and take 'em all out
one by one, you know. -That's promising.
I'm down for that.
-I mean... GABE:
 It is perfect, a chef's kiss. You know, however many Gata he wants to turn on,
that works for me. -I feel pretty good
that he's voting with us.
-Yeah. Yeah. GABE: That's the question.
I don't know. KYLE: I think Sam's more of a
physical threat, but she is.... -The social game's
the dangerous part.
-GABE: Yeah. I see Sierra as the head of the snake
 right now of Gata, and it's fitting,
because Gata's logo is a snake. So, I mean, there you go. You know, I think it'll be
 a good time to disarm 'em. And whether
it's Sam or Sierra or... Like, how do you feel
about that? -SOL: Yeah.
-Yes. -You're in?
-Yeah. GABE:
 If there are
 eight people strong, being the four Tukus,
the three Lavos and Andy,
Sierra will be out of the game. TEENY:
I think the easy thing to do,
which we could all, like, see right now is to work with
the Gatas and get a Tuku out. Right? Like, Gabe,
because whatever. Um... I kind of want
to work with the Gata... -Not the Gata, but Tuku.
-GENEVIEVE: Tuku? -SOL: Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Me, too. Would you rather lose Sam,
Sierra or Rachel? SOL:
I think it would be Sierra. TEENY: Right now
 I'm in sort of a pickle where Sierra is somebody who I feel
like I'm very good friends with. Working with her in this game
 is something I want to do. But I don't want to take the reins and be
too pushy about anything. GENEVIEVE:
Are you gonna be choked? I know you're tight
with Sierra and Sam. -Like, honestly.
-TEENY: Um... -Okay.
-I'm tight with Sierra. So I would want Sam to be
the Gata who goes home tonight. My hope is that I can convince
 everybody to vote Sam out. I am very, very scared of him. He's the bigger threat. As far as this vote goes, like, if I had my way,
it would be Sam. You want Sierra out over Sam? 'Cause that's not my preference. Sam is the biggest threat
 of the three of them. I think he's the head
of the Gata snake. I think he is charming.
He gets everybody laughing. Sam? Agreed. -Hey, hey.
-TEENY: Look at that. My vote's going on Sam tonight. That's for sure. I'd like to break up Sam
and Sierra, but... GENEVIEVE:
If they're nervous and they have an idol,
they wouldn't play it on Rachel. -SUE: Right.
-She's not in their duo. Rachel may be the easier one
to go for 'cause they would never
play it on Rachel. CAROLINE:
 Voting out Gatas is in almost everyone's
 best interest. I personally would
 love Rachel to leave. I think she's the best player in this game right now. I think she is the most
dangerous. I want her gone. -CAROLINE: I would like Rachel.
-Yeah. Genevieve would like Rachel. -Really?
-Yeah. Why? About where everyone is? I know it's weird
that everyone's, like, gone. Something just doesn't
 feel right to me. I want to feel good
in this kind of Gata-Lavo, like, union. But they're still having a lot
 of conversations with people. RACHEL:
 You just don't know
 what's gonna happen, but what I do know
is that I have an idol that nobody knows about. Now, it's, like,
 the pressure's on that I know when and if
 I need to play it. I want to go Rachel. SOL:
 I've put too much damn work in helping out Rachel to have her go home tonight. I just want
to split up that duo. Rachel can be someone
we can use. GENEVIEVE:
Rachel's my ultimate preference
 to go home. But there are many different
cooks in the kitchen, and we want different things. If you ask Teeny,
 she wants Sam out. Sol wants Sierra out,
 and I would take out Rachel. She's a strategic thinker,
 she's social. I see her as a huge threat. And in this group
 that will be voting together, what are the odds all eight of us
are gonna be like, "Hey, yeah, that's the target,
we all agree"? Slim to none. [b ar ks ] ♪ There is no life,

with our war analogy-- that seems to be the theme
of Tribal Council tonight. -It's working.
-GABE: Yeah. So, Christmas Day
of World War I, I believe, there was a ceasefire,
and both sides came together, and they played a game
of soccer. And then the very next day, they just went back to
throwing bullets at each other. And that's what auction day
kind of felt like. -Yeah, you're right.
-It felt like we all had a ceasefire. And then, the next morning,
you wake up, and shots start firing again. PROBST:
Teeny, why were you nodding? What was it
about what Gabe said? You know, we've all enjoyed
these milestones of Survivor together--
making the merge, making the jury, at this point. The next goal
is making it to the end. So, yeah, we're friends, but it's not a game of friends.
It's a game of Survivor. And there's only one winner. PROBST:
Genevieve, is a group this large just as scary if not scarier than a group of five? GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, because
in a group of five, to have a majority,
you need three, which means you need
to rely on two people. In a group this big, you need
to rely on many more people. And relying on anyone but yourself is... treacherous in Survivor. PROBST:
And Sierra,
to Genevieve's point, there's also trust. You can have all the numbers
stored perfectly, but if the information's bad, -then the numbers are bad.
-SIERRA: Jeff, school didn't come
that easy to me. And keeping all these numbers
and names and, like, putting all the pieces
together-- it's something that is really taking a toll on me
mentally, 'cause I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, how do you
keep track of all this?" But as far as tonight goes, we will see
where our trust lies, short-term and
long-term alliances, you know, starting from back
when it was just Gata, but also now,
we all have new alliances. And truthfully, I think tonight is, like, a huge outcome of what the rest of the game
will look like. PROBST:
Sam, you were nodding. -You agree?
-SAM: Yeah, I do. It's a lot more difficult
to be a shepherd when you got more animals
to keep track of. It's scary.
You want to have your finger on the pulse of the game,
vote or no vote. Like, you want
to feel like you know where things are kind of headed. But you start to wonder like, "Is there something
I'm missing?" PROBST:
Kyle, if the vote
goes the way you think it's gonna go, will it be about a group, an alliance
getting their way, or is it taking out
a threat in the game? KYLE:
We're all standing here
like a bunch of gladiators
ready to brawl in an arena. I think that if you
stand out as a threat, then you're probably
going to get hit. So it's, like, in a sick way, almost a compliment,
saying, like, "Hey, like, you're really good at this game,
and I need you to not be." -(chuckling)
-PROBST: Caroline, -you agree with that?
-Absolutely. I honestly think, at this point,
if you're targeted, it's a huge sign of, like,
respect and admiration. PROBST:
Andy, how certain are you
that you know where the vote is going? Um... I have a plan. I have a name in mind, and I do feel pretty confident that that is what's
gonna happen. Now, that's not always
been the case. Actually, you know,
my last Tribal Council, I felt confident,
and I was surprised. Point being,
people will be left out and be upset. PROBST:
All right, group question. How many people here
are uncomfortable that you could be
completely wrong? So, nobody here really has any certainty. Teeny, is this
an obvious question or does it speak
to where this game is right now? I mean, there's never
any certainty at Tribal Council, and if you feel it,
then you should be in trouble, and you usually are. But especially
at an 11-person Tribal Council, where we have not truly tested our trust
with each other. And I think it's monumental, because it's an indicator
of what to come. What happens tonight
is really going to show that, you know, there's a level
of play going on here that we haven't yet seen. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Sol, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Jeff? I thought I knew what was going on
coming into this Tribal tonight, but the longer
the Tribal went on, the more this feeling of dread filled my stomach. Um, and I was supposed
to go home last Tribal, and I don't want any shoulda, coulda, wouldas, so, -SUE: Good for you.
-I played my Shot in the Dark. Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Thank you. PROBST:
So, Rachel played her
Shot in the Dark, which means there is no vote in here
from Rachel. If this says you're safe, then any votes cast
for Rachel will not count. Rachel, you are... ...not safe. Any votes cast
for Rachel will still count. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Gabe. Sam.
Two votes Sam. Sierra. -Wow.
-PROBST: Two votes Sam, one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra. Sam.
That's three votes Sam, one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra. Sierra. That's three votes Sam, two votes Sierra, one vote Gabe. Sam. That's four votes Sam,
two votes Sierra, one vote Gabe. Sierra. -Wow.
-That's four votes Sam, three votes Sierra,
one vote left. Sierra. -We're tied.
-... Wow. PROBST:
Sam and Sierra both have four votes, so we're gonna revote. But this is a unique situation that needs an explanation. Typically, when you have
two players who are tied, they don't vote simply because they can only vote
for each other, so their votes
nullify each other. That's the only reason
they don't vote. That's not the case tonight.
Sam, you don't have a vote. You didn't cast a vote. Sierra
does, and she did cast a vote. So, Sierra,
you will vote in the revote. -Wow.
-So everybody will vote except Sam and Rachel,
who played her Shot in the Dark. And you can only vote
for Sierra or Sam. All right, Sol, you're up.
Will you come grab the urn? I acknowledge
I'm doing you dirty, but I'm a dirty player. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Sierra. One vote Sam,
one vote Sierra. Sierra. Two votes Sierra,
one vote Sam. That's three votes Sierra,
one vote Sam. Sierra. That's four votes
Sierra, one vote Sam. Eighth person
voted out of Survivor 47 and the first member
of our jury: Sierra. That's five. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. SIERRA:
Yeah. If I'm the biggest threat
sitting here, it's pretty... -I'm pretty honored,
so, thank you.
-Good game. SIERRA:
Well done, guys. Sierra, the tribe has spoken. -Can I have a hug?
-Course. -Pleasure having you out here.
-(Sierra muttering) -Oh. Bye, Sierra.
-Bye, Sierra. GENEVIEVE:
See you, Sierra. Grab your torches.
