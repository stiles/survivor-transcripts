RACHEL:
 My heart is racing. Oh, my God. I got it. Survivor bucket list. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... SIERRA:
 It just came naturally
 with Lavo. Let's Gata and Lavo
 work together and knock out Tuku one by one. -CAROLINE: Tuku?
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
 The former Gata members want to work with us,
but I'd like to shake things up. -You're in?
-Yeah. I'm going to try and steer the next vote towards one
 of the former Gata members. ANDY:
 Sam and Sierra look at me
 as an expendable piece. ANDY:
 They feel like they own me. You don't have to work
with them anymore. Yeah. Yeah. But Sam, Sierra and Rachel-- they're not
 gonna see me coming. PROBST:
Eighth person voted out of Survivor 47 and the first member
of our jury: Sierra. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ Thank you for, uh...
for keeping me. I appreciate another day. SAM:
 Tribal Council tonight
 was horrible. Rachel and I get blindsided,
 Sierra gets sent home, and we happen
 to lose Andy in the process. So, Gata is no more. Gata got got. And now... it's every man for himself. All right. That sucks really, really,
really bad. -I want to look out for you,
too, and see...
-Yeah. Yeah. SAM:
 Tonight, both Andy and Lavo flipped on Gata. It was a brilliant acting job, like, across the board. These people had me fooled, and right now, their only mistake was keeping me in the game. That Lava group is a bunch -of very, very good liars.
-Yeah. SAM:
 And then, I don't even
 want to look at Andy. SAM:
 Yeah. But I just... I don't know where
to go from here. Like, I don't know who to trust. I kind of had this gut feeling
throughout Tribal that there's something going on, but I didn't know what. And so, I played
 my Shot in the Dark. Not safe. Any votes cast for Rachel
will still count. RACHEL:
 I played it
 to gauge the reactions of everyone at Tribal
 to see if they were looking worried or surprised. And based on the reaction
that everyone had when I played
my Shot in the Dark, I did not feel like
I was the vote, and I didn't play my idol. We just got to play our own individual game and try to do what we can
for each other. Moving forward,
 I'm willing to work with just about anyone
 that will have me. I don't have a lot of options.
(chuckles) Um, my door is open,
I'm taking calls. We'll see who comes knocking. It was nice that we all stuck
to the exact plan, though. I want to say that. -Yeah.
-Yes. -Yeah.
-Yeah. Andy, thank you
for voting with us. It was a team effort. Yeah. After this vote, I'm a certified flipper. I flipped on Gata, and I feel like
this is the first step of me taking my fate
into my own hands. And so, the only thing
 I have to do at this point is damage control with the Gata members
who are left in the game. From my perspective,
we come to the merge, and I feel like I was left
to my own devices a bit. -Okay.
-So... I wanted to better my position
in the game. Since the start of this game,
 I felt like I was the outcast. I feel like I was on the bottom,
and I was sort of an expendable piece. And so, now,
 for me to be the one to get one over on all
 of my original tribe members, like, it's complete Survivor satisfaction. Not everyone gets
to feel that... that chef's kiss that I have flipped the script. Today, the target was square
on your back, and I spent some social capital
I just gained to make sure it was Sierra
and not you. Going all the way back
 to day three after the immunity challenge
and the moment I had on the mat, I fell on the bottom
 of my tribe, I succumbed to paranoia, and I thought that was just
gonna be it for me, and that was gonna be my legacy. -I appreciate it.
-All right. Yeah, dude. And so, I feel like
 I've been given the biggest second chance you could ever have
in this game. I am learning every day
 out here, and have just a huge amount of just
overall gratitude that... that this is my story,
and it's continuing, and I'm still getting
to write it. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ RACHEL: Dude. It was Sierra, predominantly, that was like,
"We could do Andy." -Ah-hah.
-And then, I was like, "I am not putting
Andy's name down again." ANDY:
 Rachel and I have both been
 on the bottom, and so, I feel like
 if I were to have a future with any of the Gata members,
it would definitely be Rachel. But the stars have not aligned for various reasons. I'm not gonna lie. That little chain of events... did make me lose trust -in Gata.
-Yeah. I feel like
 Andy and I have kind of orbited each other
this entire game. And we've, like,
wanted to connect, and then not wanted to connect and we just kind of, like,
 ping-ponged off each other for a long time. It was like a rock
and a hard place for me. -So I'm sorry, and...
-That's completely fine. -I want you in this game.
-Yeah. I wanted you
in this game the entire time. I feel like we should be working together
in this game. That was my plan on day one. -Yeah.
We're-we're in alignment. -We're synchronized.
-I agree. I'm like,
"You're strong. I'm strong." -Yeah.
-I feel like it's good. There were points in the game
where I was like, "I kind of want to work
with Andy, but, like, oh, he's frustrating to work with." You have to be careful, though. I totally... I'm so sorry.
It's just that... I just... ANDY:
 Rachel didn't feel
 the same way about me, so I was leaning in to my role,
which was the bottom player. Yeah. I'm in. All right. Fifth person voted out
of Survivor 47. ANDY:
 I blindsided Rachel
 on the Anika vote. Anika, the tribe has spoken. RACHEL:
 Andy blindsided me
 at the Anika vote and then he blindsided me again last night.
 And so, I feel like
I'm climbing a sand dune and every step I take up,
I slide two steps down. Despite all this, it's like, I've always felt
the same way about you. Like, we should probably take this opportunity
to, like, actually... Okay, can we, like... -Work together?
-Maybe we can work together. -Actually work together? Yeah.
-For real. Throughout this game, I've definitely broken trust
 with Rachel, but I do like her. I feel like we have chemistry, and we could definitely have
game chemistry out here. I feel like,
given the game board, I feel like you are an absolutely key relationship
for me right now. -Oh, Andy.
-I know. Is there anyone
you're really wary of? Oh. -There's Kyle
with the challenges.
-Yeah. Sue and Caroline,
like, don't like him. -They wanted him out forever.
-That's true. -That's true.
-He just won't lose. We've had a rocky road,
 but we're finally in a place now where we can
 maybe start to kind of, like, come together and be like, "Hi." Like, "Hello. I'm..." Like, "I'm Andy." "I'm Rachel." And it's like, almost like we can start over and, like,
 reform something and work together on some votes. I still have some sort of life
 in this game. Me rr y Ch ri st ma s Thank you (♪♪) It's that moment It's a gift It's so fluffy When a wish becomes true. A present for me? A person feels seen. I just thought God forbid

 I just want to say sorry. -Like, I know it sucks
 -SAM: Yeah. to, like, be blindsided
like that. I feel like it was... We're... From our standpoint,
kind of like, uh, Tuku wanted
to split you and Sierra up. -Mm-hmm.
-Like, thought of you guys
as a power couple, and that was really hard,
and I'm sorry. And I know how it must feel. I hope that there's still a way we could, at some point,
you know, come together. SAM:
I'm ready to play. I have a vendetta against Lavo. We thought we were working
with Lavo and, turns out, we never had Lavo. So, I'm ready for them to feel what I had to feel last night. -I want to pick myself back up
and, you know...
-For real. -'Cause, like, I really want
to play with you guys.
-SOL: Right. SAM:
 But I need to play along, at least for now, and then come
for my revenge later. I wasn't turning my back
on Sierra. I think everybody
knew that. Um... So, something had to be done
about that, from everybody else's
perspective, I get that. SOL:
 I was a part of that
 blindside against Sam, but I like Sam's mentality. He's not getting emotional,
he's not getting pissed. TEENY:
Did you and Andy mend fences,
or, like, what was... -What did he say?
-Look, I get it from Andy. -You know, I don't have
any hard feelings there.
-TEENY: Right. SOL:
 And so the fact
 that Sam's telling me, "Hey, I get it. It's all good." It's like, "Okay, maybe
I can work with this guy." SOL: Even though I worked
 with Gabe last night to take out Sierra, I think that dude's a player. I'm starting
to get, like, just... I'm so unsure
of their dynamics that, like, we should try
and make it be Gabe. SOL:
Yeah. Okay. SOL:
 At some point,
 we need to get out Gabe, and, um, that's
what I'm trying to do. (all exclaiming) Wow. RACHEL: Okay. CAROLINE:
 Tree mail says,
 "Only one of us is safe." So, what's tricky
 about this type of pairing is you're really trying
to think about, "Okay, who will get me
to that last stage "of the challenge
 where I can actually compete for individual immunity?" But I also want to be careful
 not to pick someone who's so competitive
 and so strong that they're gonna be a shoe-in
to win immunity. SAM:
Andy? Let's do it. -I'll go with Andy.
-All right. ANDY: Sam grabs me and is like,
 "Andy, let's go. Let's do this."
I thought that was interesting because I really
 betrayed him last night. But I kind of looked at it as a pretty good opportunity
 for us to at least, like,
in a challenge setting, just be kind of bros again. SAM:
 I'm really down to go
 head-to-head against Andy. If it comes down to me and Andy, I'm gonna beat him out. GABE: Me and Kyle are partners going into the challenge today,
and that's a very exciting thing for me because he's won
 the last three challenges. So, if there's anybody you want
going to battle with you, it's the guy who's on
a winning streak, and I got him. KYLE:
Based on just general knowledge
 of the game, you can expect to work together
 in a pair to a point. And then that other person
in your pair is going to become your mortal enemy
 at the end of this challenge, which is exactly why
 I picked Gabe. I think that I can beat Gabe
when we go head-to-head. ♪ ♪ Come on in! Welcome. (laughing) All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge. First things first.
Got to take back the necklaces. Look at Sue coming to me. -Oh.
-Look at this.
How kind. Thank you. -Thank you, Kyle.
-Absolutely. PROBST:
Once again, individual immunity
is back up for grabs. This morning in tree mail, you were given instructions
to divide into pairs. So let's get into those pairs.
Let me see what happened. Get next to your partner.
Let's see what's what. So, Kyle, you made these pairs. How did that go? -What happened?
-KYLE: I think everybody just kind of jived
pretty good. You know,
Gabe and I locked eyes, and I asked him to be mine
and he said yes. (laughing) All right,
let's review our pairs. We have Sue and Genevieve. We have Caroline and Rachel, Teeny and Sol, Gabe and Kyle, Andy and Sam. All right, today's challenge
is gonna run in stages. For the first stage, you're gonna crawl
 through a narrow tunnel filled with sand
 and retrieve one puzzle step. You'll then race
 to dig up a second step. The first three pairs
 to get back with their steps move on to the next stage. The last two pairs are out.
No shot at immunity. For the next stage, you will use those steps
 to build a staircase. Once you get to the top,
 you will attempt to cross a three-level
 balance beam. The first two pairs to finish move on to the final stage. You are pairs no more. You will compete
as four individuals. You'll use your hands and arms
 to brace against two walls while your feet balance on very narrow footholds. It will be painful.
 You will feel it. When you drop, you are out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final nine--
single digits. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the ninth person voted out and become the second member
of our jury. In addition, you're playing for a reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? (all voicing assent) Final four--
those last two pairs that move on
to the final round-- you will enjoy an afternoon
picnic back at camp. BLT sandwiches, potato chips, soft drinks. -Worth playing for?
-(all voicing assent) All right.
Oh, one more thing. -Ooh.
-Oh, no. The first two pairs who are out lose their vote at tonight's Tribal Council. -Wow.
-What?! Oh, yeah, one more thing. PROBST: You will take a journey
with a chance -to earn it back.
-Wow. Now we got some stakes
worth playing for. -All right.
-PROBST: We're gonna draw
for spots. Here we go. Let's go. All right, let's do this. First three pairs
to finish move on to the next stage. Last two pairs are out,
no shot at immunity. Here we go.
Survivors ready? Go! One at a time, you got
to get through this tunnel and retrieve one puzzle step. You're working
through a very narrow, very low tunnel
with a lot of sand in it. -Kyle working on those knots.
-SOL: Hell, yeah, Teeny. -PROBST: There goes Teeny.
-SOL: Hell, yeah, Teeny. Your knot's at your right. Yeah. PROBST:
You got to then untie
that puzzle step, and get it and you through
the rest of this tunnel. It is Kyle in the early lead, yet to lose
an immunity challenge. -You're good. Go, Gabe.
-(Sam groans) PROBST:
Here comes Sam
with his puzzle step. You're good! Here goes Andy. Three pairs are moving on,
so keep digging. SUE:
You're doing good, Genevieve. PROBST:
Genevieve down on the end. -And Teeny.
-My ass is too big! -KYLE: Come on, man,
-PROBST: There goes Gabe. we got this. Come on, buddy. Andy's through. Start digging. Gabe's through.
It is Sam and Andy, Kyle and Gabe in the lead. -Genevieve is through.

good job! PROBST:
You're good! Go, Sue! -Let's go, Teeny!
-SOL: Hell, yeah. PROBST:
Gabe and Kyle working
on that second step. Andy and Sam
working on that second step. (grunting) You're good.
Go, Caroline! RACHEL:
Sorry, Caroline. PROBST:
Abe and Kyle moving on. GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, Sue, yes. Sue is through. You're good. -Start digging!
-Okay. Dig. PROBST:
You're good. Go, Sol! Jeff? -Our piece is out of the bag.
-PROBST: Yup. -That's on you all.
-I'm through. PROBST:
Caroline's through. Find a step. TEENY:
You got it, Sol. -Let's go.
-PROBST: Sol is through. Everybody now digging
for their second puzzle step. Sam and Andy--
they are on their puzzle step, -but they cannot get it out.
-(grunting) GENEVIEVE:
We're so close. (indistinct chatter) PROBST:
Kyle and Gabe are moving on. PROBST: We're looking
for two more pairs. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Who is it gonna be? Look at that.
Teeny and Sol have it! They're moving on!
We're looking for one more. -Oh, my God.
-It is going to be Rachel, Caroline, Sam and Andy, or Genevieve and Sue. Sam and Andy have been working
on that piece for a long time, -cannot get it out.
-Yeah. Yeah. PROBST:
Andy's pulling on it. Can we wedge it out? GENEVIEVE:
One, two and three. -Go, go, go! Go!
-SOL: Good job, guys. PROBST:
There it is! Genevieve and Sue kept working, -and they have moved on.
-We did it. We did it. -PROBST:
Sam and Andy are out.
-We did it. We did it. PROBST:
Rachel and Caroline are out. No shot at immunity. -(sighs)
-CAROLINE: That was hard. PROBST:
You have lost your votes. Will have a chance
to earn them back later today. Sue and Genevieve,
you're moving on. Sol and Teeny, you're moving on. Kyle and Gabe, you're moving on. Move up to the next stage

-Thanks. You will return back to camp
this afternoon before Tribal Council. Everybody else
going back to camp, but Sol, Kyle, Gabe and Teeny-- you're gonna enjoy an afternoon
picnic. A little bit of a break
from the game, a chance to bond,

for the big decision tonight. Who's gonna be the ninth
person voted out and become the second
member of the jury? Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal. KYLE:
 I am a little
 disappointed in myself because I thought
 that I can beat Gabe. I really gave it my all,
 but now I'm a sitting duck. I can be picked off just as easy
 as the next guy. So, I'm nervous about tonight. I mean, what can I say?

 It's a very interesting
 dynamic after the challenge. We're all split up into three separate groups. There are the no-vote
 journey people, and they're off on a different
 island somewhere doing God knows what
to try and earn their vote back. Then there's Genevieve and Sue, who didn't lose their vote, but they didn't
get a reward, either. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And then there's
 the reward group: me, Kyle, Teeny and Sol. -Oh!
-Congrats, guys. Gabe's not with us right now. GABE:
 This is one of the best
 days of my life. This is bucket list.
This is, "Oh, my God. I'm wearing the necklace." And then, on top of that,
 it's the first proper meal I've had in 16 days. I got dizzy from just how good it felt. I'm hallucinating right now. -(groans) -TEENY: All we're hearing from Gabe right now is
 just pleasureful moaning and groaning
 as he bites into this BLT. (moans) TEENY:
 And on the other side of me, I have Sol,
who is just a burp machine. (loud burping) SOL:
 I grew up burping
 in front of my family. Whenever I'm just so comfortable
around people, I'll let it go. (burps loudly) I was trying
to keep up with Sol. (burping) It was impossible. (burping) SOL:
 I'd much rather have a cool cartoon burp than,
like, a weak-ass burp. (loud burping) GABE:
 I would chug some soda to try to force more out, and I would just get a little,
like... (imitates burp) (burps) And then, Sol just would be,
like, have his head down and lift up and just go... (loud burping) And then put his head back down,
and I was like, "I feel small right now." (loud burping) Yeah. GABE:
I mean, you wanted
Sam last night. You know I did. How do you feel about tonight? I'm so down for it. SOL:
 Sam, I necessarily
 don't want to get out. I believe he trusts me. But honestly, the reason why
 I would vote out Sam is 'cause that's what everyone wants
to do, and I'm riding the boat. It's not my name, number one. That's the most important thing. My name's not on there. Genevieve will be on board with whatever we bring to her. Sue will give us
the majority we need if we get Genevieve. KYLE:
 This is the first time I'm actually vulnerable
 in this game. I'm nervous because you never know what Genevieve
and Sue would be talking about. But, you know,
I don't really see Genevieve as, like, a super social,
like, a thinker in this game. This is what I wanted
to talk to you about. Sol wants Gabe out. SUE:
 The first time
 Tuku went to Tribal, Kyle wrote my name down. So tonight, my plan was to do a blindside on Kyle. I quite like Gabe, and I don't want him
to go home yet. I know.
He's such a good guy. -That's a huge...
-And so, like,
my preference would be get out Sol. SUE:
 But I learned that
 Sol is after Gabe. If I lose Gabe... ...like, my whole game is shot. -Sue is... Yeah.
-GABE: You know... -She's great
to have on our side.
-GABE: Yeah. -I think it's, like, very nice.
-GABE: Sue is not gonna be the person to be, like,
"Hey, everybody, it's Sol tonight." We could do a big blindside
on Sol. It would have to be a total blindside
because he's so clever. I've had a bee in my bonnet
 since my Lavo beach, where Sol targeted my ally Rome. (burps loudly) And we've mended fences-ish. But, like, in this game,
 I am so petty, and so, I've really just been waiting. "When can I get Sol?" SAM: I'm going
 into this mystery journey without a vote. I feel vulnerable and in danger and completely powerless. I have to find a way to get my vote back. RACHEL:
The last two times, it was -the same puzzle
for every person.
-ANDY: Yeah. Three people were separated
and did the same puzzle, and if they won,
they got their vote back. SAM:
 I went into the challenge with such heart and such motivation that this was gonna be the one
 that I won. I... I really wanted that one. I want it because I don't want to be the guy
 that's scratching to, you know, hang on. SAM:
 I don't know
 what's in store, but I still have a fighting shot at getting myself back into this game. All right. ANDY: These journeys are like nightmare fuel for me. We have to compete in a game, and the loser of this game
 is going to be the one player that loses their vote tonight. I'm like, "Okay, Survivor put me on this journey. Like,

 So coming back into camp, the four of us have this plan
 to tell Sue and Genevieve about Sam. TEENY:
 And it doesn't really take any time for Sol
to just shout out, "So, we decided Sam." -SUE: Yeah.
-GABE: Yeah. TEENY:
 And everybody agreed
 upon Sam to go home. GABE:
But, yeah, I think if everyone's cool
with Sam tonight, we got numbers right now. We all worked together
last night. Let's work together
again tonight. GENEVIEVE: Everyone is happy
 with Sam going, but unfortunately
for everyone else... ...I had a lot of downtime
with Sue. And when I pitch the idea
 of blindsiding Sol, Sue is open to it
 on the condition that I talk to Gabe. He is the missing piece
 to this plan going forward or not. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. The reason Gabe is pivotal
to this plan is because Gabe has the numbers behind him. All of the Tukus
 will listen to him. He's the one who will make this happen. Okay. GENEVIEVE:
 And so, I think I can use the conversation
 from this morning to my advantage
 because it allows me to approach it
 in a way that he will be extra receptive to. Basically, the name
that was said... was you. GABE:
 So me and Genevieve
 go on a walk together and she tells me. She goes, "Hey, this morning, Sol and Teeny were
throwing your name out." -My preference would be...
I would like
-Yeah. to take out the, like,
 subtle threats. Literally, no one
 is talking about Sol. GABE:
 And she said, "I think
 that we should make a move for Sol tonight." -He's good with everybody,
and I think
-No. -him and Teeny want to play
 between Gata and Tuku.
 -No, I-I think you're right. There are dangerous players
 I'm working with that I need to be prepared
to strike against before they strike me. And if Sol is coming after me,
 he's gonna regret that. It'll burn my bridge with Teeny, which makes me more vulnerable
to you guys. -And, yeah, yeah.
-But, like, if he skates by a couple more,
like, it will be you, -it will be Kyle,
and then it'll turn to me.
-Yeah. I think we could do this but there are people that I need to be on board. -Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Okay. Sol's been, like, kind of working everybody.
Like, everybody feels like Sol is their BFF. Would you be okay
writing Sol's name? KYLE:
 I'm hearing from Genevieve
 that Sol's gonna go. Sam's not even
the target anymore. Yeah. KYLE:
 Hey, I'll do
 whatever you guys say as long as I stay around. I'm just really hoping
that the rest of the tribemates that have votes are going
to side with me and decide to keep me in this game
a day longer than Sol. Yeah. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 I am a planner,
 and this Sol plan has "Genevieve Mushaluk"
written all over it. But it's very complicated
 to pitch a plan when you really have no idea what ingredients
are going into your plan. And how do you count the numbers when four people
 are on a journey? And will they all
 come back with a vote? Will they come back
 with no votes? And we need one more vote
 to do it. So, it all depends on what's coming back
 from the journey. It is a game
 for the four of us to play against one another
 in which three of us will earn our vote back,
and one of us will be without a vote
 at Tribal Council. So, the stakes are high. (neck cracking) SAM:
 This game is kind of like building a house of cards. We have to stack up these cards and not knock over the tower. CAROLINE:
 We have to form triangles on top of triangles
on top of triangles. And each card that you put down feels high-stakes. ♪ ♪ CAROLINE:
Got it? SAM: Wow. Ah. Seriously. I knocked over the tower. It all tumbled down, and I lost my vote tonight. -Back to camp we go.
-Yeah.
-RACHEL: Yeah. CAROLINE:
 Not a fan of losing my vote. I like having some control
 in the game, and I'm kind of opinionated on who I want
to have go home today. I think a lot of people
are on board -with that right now.
-I agree. I am, definitely. CAROLINE:
 If Kyle gets to the end, he's just gonna be absolutely
 hard to beat. Kyle is a big challenge threat. And I could see him winning -all the way to the end,
and, like...
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
I really want it to be Kyle, but without a vote, it's more
challenging for me to do so. -All right.
-Let's do it.

 Sam, Rachel, Caroline and Andy all return from the journey. And of course,
Caroline's the person who loses her vote. And I needed Caroline's vote 'cause she was gonna vote
with us no matter what. SAM:
We basically had to do, like, uh, reverse Jenga. We had to build a tower, and first one to knock over
the tower lost their vote. The way the votes are
shaking out right now are me, Kyle, Genevieve and Sue are gonna go Sol. And because Caroline doesn't have her vote,
five is a majority tonight. So, if we can get one more vote,
 there's our five for Sol. The difficult part of this is who else gets to know
this is happening. Hi.
So, what are we discussing? One of the stronger men
going home. Right. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 I am fully aware
 that lying to Teeny and voting out Sol is going
 to burn my bridge with Teeny. She is someone I have a complex
relationship with in this game. I care deeply about her.
I believe she cares about me. But I still think that this
 is the right move for me. Sol. I was thinking
that he can't... We can't keep him
for a long time. I think that Genevieve is feeling pretty froggy tonight. I think she's ready to jump
and hop and make a big move. But my current viewpoint
 on how to use Sol is to really just kind of
use him for a couple more votes and get rid of him. ANDY:
 And on the other hand, whenever there's a really
exciting blindside in the works, the last thing
you want to be is, you know,
missing the boat on that. Check back in with me and I'm,
like, if it's lined up, then... -Then you'd do it?
-Yeah, that'll be fine. Let me see
if I can line this up. As luck would have it,
 Andy told me Sol was also on his mind.
Not for tonight. But with a little encouragement, Andy's also in on this plan
for Sol tonight. And then
 the question mark became what about Sam and Rachel? And I thought, let's bring in Rachel
 and let's let Rachel decide
does she want Sam in or out? Okay. RACHEL:
 I am now an underdog
 in this game. And so, as much as I owe Sol for sending me
 the advantage, I am genuinely torn. But even more importantly, I don't know if I should
 let Sam in on the vote. This Tribal is my opportunity
to show these new allies that I am with them
and that they can count on me. SAM:
I want to, like,
know what's happening. I know. Hey, I can talk
to you more later. Just know that we are still
looking out for you. I can't tell you who it is.
It's not you. It's not. SAM:
 I feel very uneasy. I've been a social pariah
around here. Like, nobody wants
to talk to me. Rachel is the only person
 in the game that I believe
 I can genuinely trust, and I... I need her right now. So, I'm just gonna guess, -and you don't have
to confirm anything, obviously.
-Yeah. You're working with Tuku. You're blindsiding
one of the Lavo. -Yeah? Okay.
-Mm-hmm. I want... -Please. Please don't
blow up my spot, okay?
-I won't. I won't. Okay. I won't. SAM:
 I get the information
 from Rachel that there is a plan
 in the works to blindside Sol. And maybe I shouldn't blow up
her spot right after I tell her, "Hey, I'm not gonna blow
 up your spot," but I have to be able
 to look out for myself. And so, it's time to cause chaos. It's time to blow this thing up. Okay. You're going home tonight. -S... Shut up.
-Let's go. Are you serious? I just found out
two seconds ago. Rachel. She was like, "Sam,
 please don't blow up my spot." And that's exactly
 what I'm doing. They're telling you it's me,
telling me it's Kyle, and they're voting you out. SOL:
 Me?! I'm going home tonight?! My first reaction is panic. But I work the best
when I'm at the bottom. -And I promise you...
-Okay. that if we don't do something, -you're going home tonight.
-Okay. You, me, Andy,
Genevieve and Teeny. I want Sue
out of this game because Sue is probably the most
 insulated player in this game. I love you so much. SAM:
 Not only does she have Caroline as a tight number one. She's got Gabe
 and she's starting to get inroads with Andy, Rachel, Genevieve. If I can get Sue out, it'll free up a lot more players
 to work with, and that's important
to me at this point. I think you blow up everybody's
game if you take out Sue. -All Right. Sue.
-What's Caroline got to do? -Sue.
-All right. -And Gabe can't...
Nobody on Tuku can find out.
-Okay. My head is
 on the chopping block. The sun's coming down. I know Tribal Council
 is coming, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes. The vote was me tonight. -What?
-Yup. So, you, Genevieve, Andy,
Sam and I are voting Sue. Teeny, vote Sue. Okay. My red flags just instantly go up. I have heard nothing about this. And Sol's my number one ally and best friend in this game. TEENY:
 So, my first instinct is, we have to
do something about it, we have to save Sol. Lay it on me.
What are you thinking? I'm trying
to take out Sue tonight. And if you vote with us,
she's gone. Who do you...
Sue? -Who do you got?
-It's me and Lavo. And I think
if we take out Sue... Yeah. ...Tuku is no more. ANDY:
 Things have totally exploded. I need people to make ballsy
moves with me in this game. ANDY:
 Sam is ready
 to make his big move. He wants to gun for Tuku. Dude, this is an exciting day. This is the best day yet. But can I work with Sam again and get rid of Sol later on? This is, like, very big
 decisions that need to be made in a really short
amount of time, because Tribal is looming. It's happening, like, very soon. We're good. What? GENEVIEVE:
 Unfortunately for me,
 my beautiful plan, which was carefully laid out, all the pieces were in place... -Oh, it's...
-I don't really understand how they could have the numbers
to do you. GENEVIEVE:
 I feel it slipping through my fingers,
and have the panic of, "Oh, no.
Like, what if it is not Sol?" Yeah, yeah, so, it was Rach... They pulled Rachel in. GENEVIEVE:
 Sol is coming to me and Teeny, and Teeny's getting pulled in, and it is a mess. Sue is the best target. 'Cause we were already gonna do
 that. So it's not like... -You guys want to do Kyle then?
-Yeah. We're getting Kyle out. It's Kyle.
Will you please vote Kyle? I saved you. RACHEL:
 I'm pretty conflicted
 about what to do. There's so much going on and there's so much chaos. It's starting to dawn on me that I should have never
said anything to Sam. Sol is just freaking out. SUE: Once word spread
 that Sol was getting more paranoid, more paranoid, we all changed all of our plans. And we kept going
 back and forth, jumping from person to person
to person to person. KYLE: It's just a lot
 of running around, it's a lot of craziness, and I'm starting to sweat
a little bit on this one. GENEVIEVE:

for a mess. -Yeah.

of our jury. PROBST:
All right,
so let's review today. Three-stage challenge
that ran in pairs, but it ended up in a showdown
between Kyle and Gabe. Gabe pulled it out. Before we get into the details, one of the things
that I noticed was this group camaraderie. Lots of people hugging, "Congratulations, man.
I gave it my best." But at a certain point, the reminder that it's personal
is going to take over. So, Kyle, can you have both?
Can you have a group of people congratulate each other,
and you mean it, and then you immediately
start thinking, "But I'm taking you out,
and you have no idea"? Yeah, Gabe and I were
a perfect example of that today because, like,
when Gabe was able to pull off that W today,
I was genuinely proud of him. I was happy for that. But then, obviously,
that comes with repercussions because that means that necklace
is no longer around my neck, which means my safety
is not guaranteed. But then there's
the war at hand, where we do have to face off,
we do have to start talking about
what we're going to do and-and who needs to go home and why. PROBST:
Genevieve, does it
make it harder to vote somebody out when you have established a society that says, "We're gonna
treat each other kindly, even in defeat"? GENEVIEVE:
I don't think so because everyone sitting here is... a fan of the game. And so they can compartmentalize the different aspects
of the game. And it doesn't feel good,
but it's not because we've decided to give it
our all and be a community. It just doesn't feel good
for other reasons. But for me, personally, I saw my name on parchment at the first Tribal Council
I was at. And that gave me, you know, 007 license to kill
in this game because that could have been
my last Tribal Council. PROBST: So, Sam, one of the elements of today was four people lost votes. You had a chance to get 'em back.
How did that go? SAM:
I was able to finally earn my voting power back
in the game after feeling pretty helpless for the last two
Tribal Councils. But, you know, Caroline ended
up losing her vote tonight. PROBST:
So, Caroline, -you will not vote tonight?
-No. PROBST: How impactful is that
with all the uncertainty that's going on? It's a really weird feeling in that there's so much chaos
happening, even just behind me
in this very moment and leading up to Tribal Council. And I want to know
what's happening, and I want to be in the know,
but it feels so bizarre because I actually
can't do much about it. I can share the knowledge
that I have and my opinions, but at the end of the day,
I can't put pen to parchment. PROBST:
Sue, something else I'm noticing about tonight's Tribal is
from the second you sat down, there are tiny little
conversations happening. Yeah. In my peripheral vision
right now, I can see conversations
going on. So, it-it's sort of
freaking me out a little that people are having
these conversations already and we're still trying
to have conversations with you. Sol, the chaos
that is happening right now-- is this what it was like
back at camp? SOL:
Yes. You know, you would like to have a solid plan going in. And there was just confusion
and then more confusion. Bottom line, this game means
a lot to everybody, so you want to make sure that
you're all on the same page. And, uh, it looked
pretty chaotic, yeah. -Andy, do you agree?
-ANDY: Absolutely. The chaos is happening right now because we d not
finish at camp. I don't feel like
there's a need to hide it. It was explosive,
this scramble today. Pure disarray. No one's feeling
secure right now. I think there are conversations
that still need to be had, but we're sitting here
answering your questions, and we're just trying
to deal with that right now. PROBST:
And it's your Tribal, -so, I got some questions.
-ANDY: Sure. -You got some talking to do.
-Definitely. -We got all night.
-(laughing)
-ANDY: You just want everyone to shush? Except for me,
and I... Let me whisper. I want to get my whispers in,
and then no one else can. That would make me feel
the most secure, but that's not possible
out here. PROBST:
Teeny, Survivor requires you to be on point at any given time,
but this is very specific. This is,
"Not sure what the plan is, "not sure who I can trust.
We only have a few minutes before we vote,
so I must..." What? -Can you repeat the question?
-PROBST: Yeah. If there was one skill
that you could rely on right now, what would it be? Adaptability. I mean, I've had
different experiences going to Tribal Council. I've gone in confident and sure and been blindsided
and absolutely wrong. I've gone in confident and sure and been right
and found people I could trust. But tonight,
it's completely unfamiliar because I am going in
absolutely unclear of what I'm doing, what the people
who I've talked to are doing. And I think a lot of us
are feeling that way. PROBST:
Genevieve, that's the fear. You can never trust, ultimately, if the last
conversation was the last one you needed to have. GENEVIEVE:
What I would say is, good players are good
at deciphering new information, i.e., my plan needs to change from information
that's just noise. And so, I am going to
stay the course. And I think there are
other players out here who want to make moves and can also tell the difference
between news and noise. Kyle, is this distracting,
this animated conversation? Heck, yeah, it's distracting. There's something about it
that just, is, like, tugging on my ear. Every time I see somebody
lean over or do something, all I want to do is, like,
climb in the middle of it -and hear what's being said.
-Yeah. Sol gonna join in. So, Caroline, do you have
an idea of why there's chaos? CAROLINE:
All I know is that
chaos is beneficial for people who are in bad spots. If you're in a good spot,
and you have good "plaos"... and you have a good plan,
chaos can just destroy you. So I'm not a fan of chaos.
I... Yeah. But again, I'm not voting,
so, I'll let the chaos happen. But they can vote for you. You know, that is true. I do not like that. But the thing is,
we also have to think about what are
the other dynamics here. And I love what Genevieve said. -Oh!
-The best Survivor players
can tell signal from noise. And I'm seeing a lot
of noise right now. PROBST: Kyle, it's happening, it's real, it's alive. This is a million-dollar vote. Somebody's dream
will be squashed tonight. This is it, man.
The game is afoot. It's happening
right before your eyes and right next to my ears. I mean, this is what
I signed up for. I didn't know
it was gonna be this chaotic. GABE:
There's a lot of things
to balance when you have so many people. It's not, "Okay, I know "my two or three people.
Like, they're good. "I know they're good
because I know them "and I've been with them. "Uh, I need six or seven people
to do what I need them to do to move forward in my game." And, I mean,
this makes it very unreliable. It makes it shaky. All right. I'm sorry. PROBST:
All right, well, I said that you will have as much time
to talk as you want. I'm ready to vote.
Are you all? -Good.
-Good. Yeah.
-All right. It is time to vote. Sol, you're up. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sol. Sue.
One vote Sol, one vote Sue. Sol.
Two votes Sol, one vote Sue. Sol. That's three votes Sol,
one vote Sue. Sol.
Four votes Sol. Ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury: Sol. That's five. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch. -Good game, guys.
-Good game, Sol. -Good luck, everybody.
-Good game, man. Sol, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.

Summit, here we come! MANU:
