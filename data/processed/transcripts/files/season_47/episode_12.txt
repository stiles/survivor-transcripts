RACHEL:
Oh, my God. Yes! Bye. That's insane. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... Yeah. TEENY:
 The five of us are uniting. One of us... TEENY:
 And we're gonna flip this game on its head. ANDY:
 Genevieve telling Rachel that she's dragging me is laughable. I've been playing a game
 that no one is seeing. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being underestimated
 in this game. -Kyle?
-Yes.
-But we have to get him first. SUE:
 I knew his day would come, and I've been drooling...
(laughs) ...for this day. Eleventh person voted out and the fourth member
of our jury: Kyle. The tribe has spoken. SUE: I'm hoping that this thing
will last through the night, so, we'll push these down
a little bit more. TEENY:
You know, Kyle
was definitely a big part of the fabric of season 47. SUE: Tonight, I am
 on top of the world, because Kyle is now gone. It was always
just about his story. -Right.
-It was, like, the Kyle show. It was too annoying
and I couldn't let it go. The longer he was here,
 the more annoying he became. He walked around
 calling Caroline and I "Tweedleydee and Tweedleydum." And tonight, we got sweet,
 sweet, sweet revenge. I was, like, dead set
on having him gone. SUE:
He was taking away
our opportunity and slowly just picking off,
one by one, all of us, right?
Because he was winning. (laughing) SAM: Having Kyle was a really, really useful shield, but there's really nothing
I could have done. I was kind of powerless tonight, because there is a posse of five players: Andy, Teeny, Rachel, Sue and Caroline, picking off the big threats
one at a time. -Final seven.
-Yay. -Final seven.
-Final seven. -(laughing)
-Unbelievable. SAM:
 Genevieve and I are in a really tight spot, but this game is not over
for us yet. And as long
 as I'm on this island, I'm gonna fight. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ SUE: It's supposed to be
 two thirds, so, that's right. CAROLINE: Okay, let's light it. Maybe we'll let it keep cooking
like that a little bit more. Here, I'll do... I practiced making rice
before this, like, once. I'm actually so not a cook. Really, at this point, no one is as close as Sue and I. I wonder if sometimes she sees
her daughter in me in terms of if her daughter was playing,
maybe she imagines this is what her daughter
 would be playing like. I'm proud of you, you know? As a duo, we have all of the tools
and all of the roles that we need to make it to the end. I'm a planner, I'm a strategist, but I feel like
 Sue is my provider, and she's most willing
to, like, put her neck out there and do the dirty work. -We're animals, aren't we?
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
 She is the one who's crawling through the mud,
 searching for idols. Come on. CAROLINE:
 She's, like,
 literally crawling on, like,
 you know, hands and knees, getting dirtier, dirtier
 every single day. We all know getting to the end on Survivor is complex
 and messy and crazy, but I could not think of a better alliance
to go to the end with. Yesterday, I was, like, discounting your game. That was so, like,
stupid and unfair of me, and, like, I hope we can still
be friends after this, -that'll you'll forgive me,
-I... 'cause I'm really sorry,
honestly. -That was so disrespectful.
-Of course. I had no business doing that,
and I feel like, now you feel, like,
awkward around me. -And I'm so sorry, Andy.
-I know what we signed up for. Like, we're playing a game. And within that game
comes perception of other people's games,
and it's all fair. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
to make it uncomfortable -with you guys.
-It's okay. GENEVIEVE:
 I've sort of been
 branded as someone who is just calculated
 and strategic and doesn't really
 care about people. And in this game,
if everyone is afraid that I'm too big, too much, I think the best thing
for my game is to shrink. Game-wise, we've had...
we've had an interesting relationship, and
I just think it's kind of fun. I think what's also fun is that
we're both still in it. (laughs) (laughs)
Well, I think you'll
be in it for a long time. (laughing): I think I'm... I'm, uh, in it for now. I would love to be, like,
the big, bad wolf, still, but that is going to end my time quicker than playing possum. And at this point,
I will play possum. I will play sad puppy dog
with tail between its legs. I'll play giraffe,
elephant, whatever I need to play to stay in this game
 a little longer. I'm really not that dangerous,
 you know. You've-you've taken off my claws and teeth, and now I'm just a house cat. There are folks on this beach that are the bigger threat
 than I am right now. Look where we've ended up,
Genevieve. From the insane asylum of Lavo, all the way to Beka Beach,
where bad things happen. I do think if Rachel goes out, everyone's chances
of winning get better. -I hear you.
-Like, I think everybody actually
likes her the most. She's playing the game
that I wish I played. It is, like, very calculated,
organized and controlled. You think that's what
the jury's thinking, is Rachel is the biggest threat
right now? Rachel has been, like,
tactical about everything, like, flawlessly. Like... I'm not a slam dunk for you
if Rachel is there. -That's what I'm saying.
-Sounds like a threat. I say it's not
a slam dunk for you and then you come back
and tell me that's a threat? She doesn't think
I can beat Rachel. Okay, that was
a ... th And I'm insulted by her words. You definitely
use emotions as a weapon. TEENY:
 Genevieve is desperate,
 trying to cause some chaos, and I'm not falling
 into that trap because Sam and Genevieve
 are both on the bottom. They're people
 who have hurt me in the past, they're people
who bothered me in this game. I'm just giving you my opinion,
'cause you asked. All right. At this point
 in our coalition of underdogs, we're sick of Genevieve and Sam. We're scared
of Genevieve and Sam. Ugh. TEENY:
 One of them is going home, and there's nothing
 they can do about it. So awkward. Oh, my God. I hate that they're almost,
like, just c... wallowing together.
I don't know. Like, commiserating,
but, like... -They just think...
-Uh-huh. No. I mean, they're-they're
very outwardly joking -about how they know
it's them two.
-Yeah. It's almost, like,
uncomfortable. -Yes.
-Okay. TEENY: Yeah. RACHEL:
 I found out this morning that Sam and Genevieve are actively trying to target me and giving all these reasons
why I'm going to win. It is scary,
 but I also feel pretty secure in the people
 that I have my trust in. I think that, no matter how
 scary they make me out to be, they're always going
to be more scary than me. RACHEL: But also, I do have this idol that nobody knows
about, and I do have a Block a Vote Advantage, and the alliance of five
 knows about it. All of them. So, I feel good. And I'm loaded.
Locked and loaded. I gi ve u p my b es po ke sh av in g su bs cr ip ti on . And I'll stop

Oh, boy. All right,
shall we get to today's -reward challenge?
-(all voicing assent) PROBST:
 For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race through a series of obstacles and retrieve a ball
 from a net tunnel. Then you'll retrieve
 a second ball and crawl
 under a net to the finish, where you will attempt
 to land both balls on a two-level perch. First player
to finish wins a reward. -Want to know
what you're playing for?
-(all voice assent) The winner will enjoy a nice
afternoon at the sanctuary, where good things happen. An afternoon filled with... ...Italian food. (all exclaiming) Pizza. -Ah.
-PROBST: Cheese. -(gasps) Cheese. Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Pepperoni. -Pepperoni.
-PROBST: Margarita. -Oh!
-How about some pasta? (all voicing assent) -PROBST: Bolognese?
-Yeah. -PROBST: Mushroom?
Yeah. Crisp, fresh, Caesar salad. -(all gasping)
-Fixings? Fixings. Why not? -Yeah.
-You like red wine? -Oh!
-PROBST: Some red wine or soda, if you prefer,
and for dessert, tiramisu. -Oh.
-(all exclaiming) -Worth playing for? All right.
-(all voicing assent) We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go. -Wow.
-Sanctuary awaits. Sure. PROBST:
All right, here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go!
First you got to get rid of all those sandbags. Three of them are easy.
Push 'em over. Three of them are tied up. PROBST:
You're gonna have
to quickly untie those knots. Then you go over
the same way the bags go over. Just keep ripping
through that rope. Launch those sandbags
and toss yourself over, and you're on to the next stage. Rachel, you're good. Rachel's over first. Rachel in the lead.
There's Sam right behind. Got to move that ball
through the net tunnel. Here comes Andy. -Ooh!
-PROBST: There's Genevieve. Here comes Caroline. (groans)
Ooh. PROBST:
There goes Teeny.
Here comes Sue. Everybody now in the net tunnel. You can go from the side, you can go from the top,
you can go from the bottom. You just want to move that ball. Rachel still in the lead,
moving quickly through this second stage. And it's Sam and Genevieve on the end. Everybody else trying
to catch up. Rachel close. She's got it.
Rachel still in the lead. Rachel now gonna
untie that second ball. -Genevieve has it!
-Aah! Here comes Andy now. Sam's at the very end. Got to knock it through, Sam. Rachel has her second ball. She's working through
the net crawl with both balls. Sam's in it now. Got four people in the third
stage of this challenge. -SAM: Let's go.
-Rachel still in the lead. GENEVIEVE:
Good job, Sam. You got this. Let's go, man.
Let's go, man. Genevieve has her second ball. Teeny through the net tunnel. She's at the third stage now. Genevieve working
to catch Rachel. Here goes Sam.
Quickly got his second ball. Sam now ripping
through this net. Sam is making up a ton of time. Sam is gonna catch Rachel. PROBST:
And Sam comes out
ahead of Rachel now. It's Sam and Rachel at the final stage
of this challenge. Here comes Andy. On the end is Genevieve. Caroline, Sue,
still back at the second stage. (grunting) PROBST:
Now you got to land both balls, one on each level of this perch. -(Rachel grunts)
-PROBST: Andy's through now. He's in on it. Sam lands his first ball. Sam can win it with this toss. On and off. Here comes Teeny. She's in.
Genevieve's in on it now. (sighs) Rachel with a toss. Andy trying to land his first. It is Sam in the lead. Would be a nice victory
for Sam today. An afternoon at the sanctuary. Rachel lands her first ball.
We are tied. It is Rachel and Sam
both now working on that second and final ball.
Sam on and off. Rachel could win it. No, just short. -Sam is on
-Aah! and off again. Rachel could win it. On and off. -Yes!
-PROBST: Sam does it! -It's over.
-TEENY: Oh, my God. Sam wins reward, -GENEVIEVE: Good job, Sam.
an afternoon at the sanctuary for pizza and pasta. -Amazing.
-PROBST: Wow. Fun finish. No problem, man. (Rachel sighs) Sam, come on over. -Good job, Sam.
-Good job. PROBST:
Well done. So, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna
go to the sanctuary. Nice afternoon. Pizza, pasta. When the afternoon ends, you'll have a pillow,
you'll have a blanket, -'cause you're gonna
spend the night.
-Oh. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Get what might be your only good night's sleep out here. This is the fuel you need for these last six days. And to make it
a little more enjoyable and a lot more complicated, you will also have
your letters from home. What? PROBST:
You're gonna have
a little reminder of why you are out here. So now, big decision. -Yeah.
-Choose one person to join you. Yeah. Um, the problem with
being in this position, as happy as I am for myself, there's people that I have to
take that opportunity away from, and that's difficult to stomach. Nobody wants to miss out
on the letters, Jeff. (Sue sniffles) So, the letters are arguably -more valuable than the food.
-It's more important... it's
more important than the food for most of the people here,
I think. -I...
-Genevieve, agree with that? -Yeah.
-PROBST: You can't even talk. -Sue, what's going on with you?
-(sighs) I understand he has
a really tough decision to make, and I know every single one
of us has the exact same reason of why we want
our letters from home. So, it's gonna be hard, you know, for anybody
who doesn't get those letters. Um... there's one person here
that I promised I would take on a reward
no matter what. I think they're the most
deserving person over there. So I'm gonna go with Andy. -Good job, Andy.
-PROBST: Andy. Andy, you look surprised. Come on over. Thanks, man. Andy, why so shocked, given that Sam's already
told you he would take you? I'm the last person I expected to be picked for this reward,
to be honest. I'm...
Game-wise, we're up and down, and I don't think we're on the
best terms currently, game-wise. I-I do what I say I'm gonna do. -Yeah.
-And I told Andy I would
take him, so... I take him. PROBST:
All right, Sam, you have
one more choice. That's it. So three of you are gonna
be at the sanctuary. Four players
will be back at camp with nothing but some rice. Tell me who your
final choice is and why. I don't think it would be right for me to eat Italian food
without Genevieve, -so I'm gonna pick Genevieve.
-PROBST: Genevieve, come on over. Thanks, man. PROBST:
All right, here's
what's gonna happen. Sam, Genevieve, Andy, you're gonna leave here,
enjoy the nice afternoon. You'll spend the night. You'll
return to camp in the morning. Grab your stuff, head out. -I'm sorry, guys. Sorry.
-You're gonna slam some pasta. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Well done. You earned it. -Enjoy.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff. (sniffles) All right, they're gone. So, what impact does this have,
game-wise, if any? 'Cause this is always
a big turning point. Teeny. I mean, Genevieve and Sam
have already made themselves
a very clear duo in that they're both the targets
and the threats in this game. And as far as I see it, relying on me
to try and pull me in -to get one
of the remaining people out.
-Right. So, leaving me here
and not choosing me-- it-it definitely
pushes me one way. And so, I think it was a bit of a foolish decision
for Sam to pick her. I think it's actually going to have a horrible outcome
for their game. -Yeah.
-PROBST: All right, Caroline, Rachel, Teeny, Sue,
got nothing for you. -Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
-Thank you. -Hope they enjoy
the last supper.
-(chuckles) Yeah.
We're eating all the rice. RACHEL:
 Loved ones letters is always contentious. People get pissed.
It's like choosing bridesmaids. Like, you just don't
want to do it. And so, as hard as it was
 to lose that challenge, Sam doing this and just, like, pissing off so many people is a pretty good thing
for my game and my alliance. It's going to make us tighter. I wa s st uc k. Unresolved depression

-ANDY: Ah! SAM:
Oh, my God. Can't win immunity
 to save my life, but boy, can I win reward.
 Third time at the sanctuary.
I feel like a seasoned vet showing a couple of rookies
the lay of the land. GENEVIEVE:
Food! Gorgeous! -Shall we?
-It smells so good.
-Yeah, let's figure it out. Probably not a big shocker
 that I've never had tiramisu, but this is
 not just Italian food. This is an overnight reward with blankets,
 and the cherry on top: loved ones' letters,
 something that every Survivor player
dreams of getting. -Cheers.
-Cheers. Cheers.
-Final seven. -Final seven.
-Final seven. -Loved ones.
-Italian feasts.
-Oh, my God. -GENEVIEVE: Thank you, Sam.
-ANDY: Thank you so much. SAM:
Yeah, man. I knew
coming into the challenge that I wanted to pick you two, but I hope the people
at camp aren't mad at me. -Mm-mmm.
-ANDY: No. SAM:
Dude, Andy, you've been through 21 days of this game
with a lot of really low lows. You've kept a smile
through all of it. I have so much respect for that. And early in the game, I was not the friend or ally
to you that I needed to be, and so,
I want to make up for that. -ANDY: I'm speechless right now.
-Yeah. -So...
-Dude, it means everything. SAM:
Yeah, man. There are probably
 four people at camp that are not
 thrilled with me right now, but I knew I was
 gonna choose Andy before the challenge
 even started because I feel like
I do owe Andy a little bit. GENEVIEVE:
Oh, my God, this is basil. SAM:
 And Genevieve and I
 have felt like we are on the bottom. So, giving her
 the emotional support of letters from home-- easy no-brainer. This is, like, insane, like, timing for this day. Like, Sam, you don't
know this yet, but I talked to Andy this morning,
it got a little intense, and now I'm, like,
the happiest I've been. SAM:
Can I ask you something? -GENEVIEVE Okay.
-SAM: I'm-I'm just curious to your non-emotional approach. Like, where do you think
that comes from? I wasn't planning
to be closed off and detached, but Kishan was, like, one of my first friends here. -Yeah.
-And when we voted him out, his, like, last words were, -"I trusted you."
-SAM: Hmm. Like, very, very sincerely
and very sadly. And I just kind of,
at that point, was like, "I don't want to get
emotionally close to people "or, like,
let them get close to me, knowing I'm going
to vote them out." And I kind of regret that. Like, you know, it's-it's hard
to hurt people, but then you miss out on
all of the connection and, like, I wish
I learned that day one instead of day 21, but... You learn by going through it, -by having these experiences.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah. -SAM: Better late
than never, though.
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 This girl has learned keeping everybody at arm's
 length makes it easier to vote them out,
but it makes it easier for them to vote you out, too. And so, what I need to focus on now is to let everyone in
 a little bit... SAM:
The letters. -I'm ready.
-Yours are heavy. GENEVIEVE:
 ...even though it's awkward and uncomfortable
and vulnerable and I hate it. My dad was telling me,
 "You can do this. "We love you,
 and I'm sure you have so many friends." (sniffles) And I have no friends out here. And it's my fault.
Like, I chose... I chose to have no friends. Who does that?
(sniffles) Who does that? (laughs softly) But my husband says,
 "If you have a bad day, "try to slow down. "Remember that mistakes can be fixed,
especially in Survivor." (laughs) "No matter
 what happens out there, you are coming home to the same
 amazing life you left." (crying) SAM:
 My brother wrote,
 "I know some days "you probably want
to get on a plane and fly home, "but I want you to know "that I'm proud of you. "I've always admired
your sense of adventure "and your willingness
to do something scary because it might be fun." (exhales sharply) It gives me a lot of confidence in who I am as a person, and it's what
 I needed to remind myself. My loyalty is to the people
writing these letters. ANDY:
 My mom is an absolute
 superfan of this game. When she first learned
that I might be going out here, it became, like,
 the light of her life. This is the proudest
 she's ever been. It's so meaningful
to hear from her right now. This game is intense.
 I've had tough times. Nothing's been perfect. It hasn't been easy,
 but I persevered. It's been
 completely life-changing, and these letters
 are exactly what I needed. There's less than a week left
to go, right? And my decisions will dictate
 what my fate is and, dare I say, my Survivor legacy. All I have to do is just go all frigging out until the very,
very, very bitter end. I'm more than fueled
 for the rest of this game. I honestly feel like
I should give myself a second -before I say things
I'm gonna regret.
-Yeah. Okay. But I also couldn't think
of the three better people -to sit here and dissect
-Yeah. every inch of why that was the dumbest thing
Sam could have done. -He's really not playing.
-Sam just quit the game. -He's not smart at all.
-TEENY: In my opinion, Sam just quit the game.
Sam just decided that he was going
to have his last meal with his best friend
and enjoy a last supper. -I agree.
-TEENY: And there we go. It's so idiotic to me. You'd think just maybe,
just maybe, he would try a Hail Mary, to pick me,
somebody he could pull over. But you know what, guys?
He's a stand-up guy. -SUE: Oh, yeah. Go, Sam!
-He's a hero! Most generous man I've ever met. Sam wants to be the hero. (whoops) He is just this honorable, strong, just smart guy. So he picks the only other guy
 out here-- Andy, his boy. Sam thinks him and Genevieve
are gonna talk to Andy, get him a little red-wine drunk,
and that they're gonna convince -Andy to flip on this...
-And me. And that they're going...
Yeah, on you. -RACHEL: I'm not worried.
-TEENY: Oh, he's not gonna flip. -SUE: You don't think so?
-TEENY: If he does again, -they still need another person.
-CAROLINE: Doesn't matter. We just have to worry about
any advantage that they get. -Sam just has to go, period.
-Yeah. -TEENY: And...
-RACHEL: Yeah.
-Bam. TEENY:
 It just feels like
 Sam is checking every box on Teeny's list of why he needs
to be the one to go home in both personal
and strategic ways. -Am I just, like,
a man-hater at my core? Like...
-SUE: No. I think he's just always been,
like, popular, the class clown, like... -And that... (grunting)
-SUE: Yeah, he was probably prom king. TEENY:
 Having somebody who's, like, your typical, all-American, quarterback-looking guy around all the time--
it's just not... it's just not my thing. Sam's gonna come back
and be like, "Ah, it was good. "Like, we had pasta, "and you know, like,
I'm sorry, guys. "It was a really rough spot
to be in. "I hope you get it. Like,
me and Genevieve are just, like, on the bottom together
and, like..." -He'll be crying, too.
He'll be crying.
-"I just, you know, the Italian, she'd be talking
about that chicken parm, and..." I'm also jealous.
 I want to be there. I'm not gonna lie about that.
I want the food, I want the loved-one letter. But Sam left
 the four of us girls here to basically plan his demise, which will be coming imminently, and will be something
I take great joy in. -Me too.
-Me too. Me too. I mean, I am obsessed
with the idea of all women. -SUE: Me too.
-CAROLINE: I would be proud -to sit by all four of you,
and I also think -Same.
-all four of us, I think,
have a genuinely, like, pretty good shot
against each other, -in the best way possible.
-TEENY: Yeah. Me too. -In a positive way.
-It would be, in a positive way. I would be proud
to end my Survivor journey -side by side by any of you.
-SUE: Yeah.
-TEENY: Me too. I would have zero regrets. Me too. And I would be happy
if any of you won. CAROLINE: I'm liking this four
 a lot, so I'm hoping to use some, like,
morale, kumbaya, "We're four final women,
we got this, let's go." We're gonna vote out Sam first,
and it's gonna be glorious. TEENY:
That smug face. I just can't.
I can't, I can't, I can't. CAROLINE:
 We are gonna be
 the final four women. So, we're really solidifying how is it we're gonna
 get rid of Sam, then how are we gonna get rid
of Genevieve, and then how are we gonna
get rid of Andy. -SUE: One, two, three.
-Oh. Got it. -Nice.
-RACHEL: Oh, my. Balance a sec. We got it. This is the four
 who are going to run this show to the very friggin' end. -Um, girl power!
-(whooping) Girl power. CAROLINE:
 I'll be honest. I can see the million dollars. I can see the Final Tribal.
I can see my pitch. I can see myself
winning this game, and it's intoxicating,
 and it's so exciting. -Good job, guys.

a good time to talk game. I'm not sure if you brought me
here for a specific reason, to, like, wine and dine me.
Regardless, I woke up this morning
with a plan. I like day 21 plans, Andy. Me too. Me too. This is an opportunity
that we cannot pass up. What I want this to be
is the defining conversation and night
for the rest of this game. GENEVIEVE: I don't conduct
much business in beanbag chairs, but Andy calls a meeting
 and, like, the last couple days,
I have been on this slow march to death in this game. I'm all ears. Talk to me, Andy.
What is your plan? I'm coming over to you. But here's what's working
against us. There is a five-person alliance
called the underdog alliance, and I've been voting with them. It's highly unrealistic
we pull any of them. Oh, really? You think so? ANDY:
There is no...
There is no chance. So what we have in our favor is that we have the time
and space tonight to come up
with a pretty elaborate plan. The goal is build suspicion
that one of you has an idol. If we do that, they will
be compelled to split the vote. Then all I have to do is swing
my vote over to you guys and we take out Rachel. Obviously,
she's a big threat, right? She also has an advantage.
She has a Block a Vote. Does everybody know that
except us? -ANDY: Yeah. Yeah.
-Wow. Andy is my hero. This is what Genevieve and I
have been waiting for. It's time to get the band back together
 to take out Rachel. I'm going all out,
and I have no fear. This is really
our only chance of winning, is getting together right now. It really is high time
for me to go for broke. The way I started this game
 built an initial perception that I was a goat. This is my opportunity
 to make my mark and finish this game off in a
way where I can get first place. Do you think they're gonna be
suspicious when you come back -to camp?
-Yeah. We have to come up
with a whole fake story. We have to milk the time
 that we have on the sanctuary to put together
 a very difficult mission. This is not simple. It's going to require
 thorough planning, a lot of stealth and just pure execution. Yeah. ANDY: This is the biggest heist
 of season 47 of Survivor, and we're calling it
"Operation Italy." -SUE: Hello.
-SAM: Hello. -Hello, hello.
-Hi. Long time no see, people. Step one of Operation Italy is to channel all
of my theater experience. I'm obviously sorry
about that yesterday. It was a hard spot. -SAM: Yeah.
-TEENY: Yeah.
Don't worry about it. SAM:
 I'm laying it on thick.
 I'm apologizing. I'm kind of going
 right back to the playing-dead Sam that I was before this plan. And I'll do anything to live
 another day in this game. I would rather do Rachel,
but if I have to do Genevieve, I will do Genevieve
to stay in the game. -And I am... and I am... I...
-Like, I'm not... Looking pretty dire for me. Still kind of a free agent,
um, out here. I don't know
how you see things now, but, you know,
I'm trying to just survive. If this works, there's gonna
 have to be a couple Oscars handed out
to Genevieve, Andy and myself. It's gonna take that level
of performance to, like,
 really nail this thing down. But I'm feeling
 pretty confident. GENEVIEVE:
 Operation Italy depends on a split vote, and the only reason
people would split a vote is if they're worried
you have something. At the sanctuary,
 Sam gave me his original idol from Gata, which is expired. He also gave me two bracelets
 from tree mail that I'm going to craft together
to try and make an idol. I love this plan,
 but for Operation Italy to have any hope,
 everybody's story has to paint a picture
for the broader group, and it has to all seem
 like it's making sense... This could work.
This could work. ...until the moment
people realize it doesn't. And that moment has to be
when the votes are read. I have made a Beka merge idol. I'm sorry. We were... We all felt bad
for you, honestly. Everything but the let... Yeah. ANDY:
 My role for Operation Italy is to reingratiate myself with
my underdog alliance of five because I had been away for a really long time. It was bad energy
because they pitched me hard. Yeah.
We knew they were gonna. ANDY:
 I need them to feel that I am still trustworthy and that I am still
a number for them. I don't like
how they approached me because it just felt like they brought me to wine
and dine me and try to, like, -Mm-hmm.
-be a vote for them. It just felt, like,
really premeditated. Like, they brought me
to wine and dine me. I could just tell
that they just picked me -to wine and dine me,
that, like...
-Of course. They're saying, like,
"You just have to come with us." -Yeah.
-It's very strong-armed. And it was just not
the right approach for me, because it was, like,
strong-arming me. Well, I'm all set.
I'm right where you left me. ANDY:
 Step number two: foster suspicion that Genevieve has
a hidden immunity idol. I'm most afraid of the idol. I'm most afraid
of the idol. Do you know if they got any kind
of advantage? -They did, didn't they?
-It's hard to say. -SUE: Oh, shoot. Okay.
-I don't know. This fake information that Genevieve has
 a hidden immunity idol is going to cause
paranoia, insecurity, and that will help me
 convince my alliance to split the vote. Teeny and Rachel were kind
of preferring for Sam to go out first. -How do you feel about that?
-I'm down for it, but -I'm most afraid
of the idol, so, I...
-Yeah. If you... if we were to decide that we put more on Genevieve, then we can guarantee
we're flushing it. -But anyway... Sorry. Go ahead.
-Oh. Oh. We were thinking... Oh. So, um, instead,
prioritize Genevieve? Yeah, because then, we can get
that idol out tonight -no matter what.
-I'll be honest. The idol
scares me the most, too. So then, we would need to then -split the vote to make sure.
-ANDY: Yeah. Yeah. It's the best play-- splitting
a vote to account for an idol. Operation Italy
 has been executed to perfection. My underdog...
(blows raspberries) ...underdog alliance of five
has no idea what I'm cooking. It's really smart. CAROLINE: Thank you, Andy. It's time to strike.

Should we get into it? -(all voicing assent)
-All right, first things first. Rachel, got
to take back the necklace. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Thank you. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge
will require a combination of balance, dexterity and touch.
Here's how it works. First, you must navigate
 a balance beam while transporting
 a ball on a pole. Once you're done with that,
 you must then quickly maneuver two skulls
 through a metal maze. Once you've completed that,
 you'll move to the finish, where you will need touch as you roll balls
 along a paddle, attempting to land three of them in any of the five targets. First person to accomplish all of that earns this. The immunity necklace.
Safe tonight at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot
in the final six. Losers, Tribal Council
where somebody will be twelfth person voted out
and become the fifth member of our jury. -Shall we get to it? All right.
-(all voicing assent) We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go.
For immunity and a spot in the final six. Survivors ready? Go! First stage is about balance. You've got a balance beam and you have a ball on a pole. It's gonna want to drop off
like it just did for Rachel. -Oop!
-PROBST: Genevieve drops. She's got to go back. Teeny out to a fast start. Sam on the course,
Rachel back out. Everybody now doing it. Teeny's first across.
You're good. Drop it and move on. Here comes Sam.
Sam's across. You're good. Rachel's across. You're good. Caroline drops.
She's got to go back. Teeny, Sam, Rachel all have their double-ended
warrior staff. They're maneuvering skulls
through a metal maze. This is tougher than it looks. Teeny now struggling
in this second stage. Sam moving quickly through. Andy's across the beam. He's trying to get back in this. Every single second's
gonna count when you get
to that final stage. You got to get
through those beams. Let's go! Andy's now in it. Rachel doing a nice job. Sam and Rachel pulling ahead. Andy's starting
to gain some ground now. Sam's gonna be out first. Sam, you're good! Sam is moving on
to the final stage. This is where it is won or lost
with your ability to navigate that little ball down your paddle
into a tiny dimple. Sam trying to stick his first. He can't do it. There goes Rachel. It is Rachel and Sam. Teeny has hers. Let's go, Teeny!
She's through. You just need three balls in any of the five spots. This is all about touch. The question is who's gonna
figure out the touch first? There's definitely
a learning curve, but once you learn it,
this can go quickly. You've got to get it to stick
in one of those little dimples. It doesn't matter which one. Rachel has her first. Sam's still trying
to get it to stick. He's all around it. Teeny having no luck. Andy now gonna
be in on the paddle. Can he make up some time? Sue trying to get in on it. Here comes Genevieve. PROBST:
Immunity on the line. Sue's good! Sue, you're in this. Here comes Genevieve. These paddles are heavy. The weight is not
distributed evenly. This is gonna be hard. Okay. PROBST:
Rachel, another ball out. This is her second. Very close. Can she get
that second ball to stick? And she does. It is Rachel in the lead
with two. One ball left. Nobody else has anything. Andy drops, got to start again. -Teeny struggling.
-Oh, my God. PROBST:
Sam still trying
to get his first. Nobody else having any luck
right now. Aah! Hey. Oh. PROBST: Rachel now one ball away
from winning her second individual immunity and
guaranteeing herself a spot in the final six. She's in, she's out. And she's in! It's over! Rachel wins individual immunity, guaranteed a spot -in the final six.
-Damn. -PROBST: Wow, that was fast.
-SUE: Good job, Rachel. -GENEVIEVE: Good job, Rachel.
-CAROLINE: Wow. -PROBST:
Rachel, come on over.
-(whooping) Going right back on. Thanks again, Jeff. Once again, safe tonight at Tribal Council, cannot be voted out
of this game. You will have a spot
in the final six. As you inch closer
to that final four, -where you know
nobody can take you out,
-RACHEL: Yeah. what is the feeling?
You're that much closer. It's crazy, you know?
I mean, I had a really rough entry
into the merge, and so, to be standing here with the immunity idol again-- I feel amazing.
Like, this is wild, and -I'm excited.
-PROBST: Here's what we know. You are safe.
For everybody else, somebody's dream of Survivor 47
will come to an end, twelfth person voted out,
fifth member of our jury. Grab your stuff. Head back to
camp. See you tonight of Tribal. -Congrats.
-Thanks, Jeff. ANDY:
 Rachel-- she wins a challenge, she dominates,
 and now she has immunity. And... that's a setback. It's a setback for Operation Italy
 'cause she was the target. She was the hit.
Now that Rachel's off the table, the real big question is
 who is the new target? Th er e he i s. Wherever I go they always
 ask “Where's Waldo?” Ah, you found me. Never “Who's Waldo?” Sometimes it takes someone
 who really knows you to make you feel seen. Gifts that say I get you.

 First thing I want to say, if this is our last

playing with you. If it's... if it's me going,
fight like hell, get there,
and you got my vote. -Likewise. Likewise.
-If you go,
I'll fight like hell. GENEVIEVE:
 The hit was out on Rachel, and she wins the challenge. Of course. Not great for me. Not great for Operation Italy. But Operation Italy was designed to be flexible. -I would love
to do Caroline instead.
-Yeah. We have to pick
between Caroline and Teeny, -and somehow let Andy know.
-Okay. 'Cause I still
want to do the plan, -basically, as usual.
-Yeah. -Did you do it? Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. But the string
you got was a black string -to make with the beads.
-Oh, this is beautiful. This is b... This is good. Pretty good, I think. And so, my plan with this is to ensure
 there is a vote split tonight because we need the vote split. We need Andy in the majority
 side of the vote so that he can flip,
and that is the recipe to success for Operation Italy. Obviously, this move is, like... Andy is the straw that stirs
the drink in the move, and he plays
the most pivotal part. To final six. I don't think she has an idol. -Really? I think she does.
-I don't think she has it. Yes, I... I don't think
she has it, but, like, -I just want him out.
-Okay. I think she...
I think she has the idol. She... ANDY:
 I still want Operation Italy
 to really succeed tonight. And so, I'm like, "Here's what we should do.
We should split the vote. "We should split the vote. Then we should flush out
 Genevieve's idol." The only hiccup here is that Teeny, Teeny, Teeny
has her own agenda. The thing is... I think it makes more sense
to just, like... It's, like, we get the idol out
100%, and we do it that way. I guess... I guess
your plan's better, but I just don't think she does,
and I think... It's the path of least
resistance in terms of risk. TEENY:
My preference to go home tonight
 is definitely Sam. But we also want to flush this
hypothetical, mysterious idol
that we think Genevieve has. I'm scared, if Genevieve
 doesn't have an idol, and we stack the votes on her, she's gonna walk out the door and Sam's still gonna be here. GENEVIEVE:
As Teeny walks up to Sam and I,
 now I'm nervous, because my fake idol
is not perfect. It's fake, it's counterfeit.
I know that. If she looks too closely,
 she may know that. Why? Keep it on me. If it changes, let me know. Am I... am I gathering
what I think I'm gathering? You're gathering
what you think. -Can I see it?
-Yeah. I need to show it to her
 to have her believe it, but I can't show it
to her too long because then she'll know
it's a fake. GENEVIEVE: Okay. No. I flash this idol
 and then, thank God, Andy's coming around the corner.
I jam it back in my pocket. And so I'm thinking I'm
 in the clear. I've given her, like, just a glimmer,
and that should be good. But I don't think
they think I have anything. Are you sure that's real?
Do you have a note or anything? I buried the note. But, yes, I know it's real because I had
to do the steps this morning. Why do you think I was down
by the freaking water? -Oh.
-Yeah. TEENY:
 When Genevieve shows me
 that she has the idol, I'm relieved in a way, like
it was written in the stars. I already wanted Sam to go. Now I know for a fact that
 Genevieve has an idol, I think I'm gonna sit
on the information. I'm gonna know
Genevieve's safe tonight. I'm going to. I'm going to. TEENY: And now knowing
 that tonight's vote will go exactly how we think it will, it's just... chef's kiss, and I'll see Sam later. -We are 95% there.
-Okay. -Has it?
-And it's... Yeah. -That's perfect.
-Let 'em split... -Which is exactly
what we wanted to, so...
-Okay. -I agree.
-That's what my gut tells me. I'm the mafia boss. I'm the
 architect of Operation Italy. The target has to be Caroline. -So, you want Caroline?
-Yeah. Everything's a go.
It's perfect. Operation Italy is
in a good place right now. She's got her number one: Sue. That little
 loyal, loyal, loyal bond, which makes her powerful
 in this game. And Caroline is the brains
 of that pair, and so, she's got to sleep
with the fishes. All right, beaut....
beautiful, beautiful. Oh, let's go. Operation Italy, baby. I have this optimistic feeling
 in my gut that we're gonna be able
to pull this off. -Uh... (laughs)
-(laughs) SAM:
But the underdog alliance needs to believe
that nothing has changed, and I'm still little old Sam just trying
 to survive another day. I think
Genevieve's voting for you. Mm-hmm. SAM:
I'm down to write
whatever keeps me in the game. RACHEL:
I'm writing down Genevieve. Look at me.
Writing down Genevieve. -SAM: Really?
-Yeah. I know that Genevieve
 is voting for me. It's actually gonna be
 the first time I've seen my name on parchment. And part of me is like, "Okay. "This is actually giving
a little bit of validation that I am a threat." It's reminding the jury
before I do, which is nice. But it's nerve-racking. Yes. Where is it? CAROLINE:
 The biggest concern is
 does Genevieve have an idol. -SUE: I got my eye on 'em. -CAROLINE: I get to go through her bag, but what sucks is I don't think I'm gonna get any definitive answers,
even from that. I didn't see anything in hers. I can't say
I went through it completely, -but, like,
didn't see anything there.
-Okay. CAROLINE:
 Granted, I trust my alliance, but it's just
an unsettling feeling to know that there is a bit of a door open
 for you to go home. So, she's writing my name down. We-we need what's-her-name
to play her Block a Vote then. I just... I mean, if everything -goes according to plan...
-But we need to make it
through tonight. -I'm-I'm afraid so, like...
-Yeah? I'm putting, put...
playing my idol for you. -I mean, I know
it's my neck on the line.
-I'm gonna go with your gut, -but, like,
I want you protected.
-I think it's... Thank you. I mean,
I want to be protected, too. SUE:
 Caroline being voted out is my worst-case scenario.
 I still have my idol. If I get a gut feeling, I'm whipping that thing out and saving Caroline. It's just weird that they're
so relaxed and comfortable. -Yes.
-Like, something's going on. SUE:
 But as long as
 my group all stay strong, we can't go wrong.
We can't go wrong. I think I have different plans about, like, how we want
to approach it tonight. Basically, we want Genevieve
to think it's her so that she plays an idol
if she has it, even though
we're voting Sam out. And we can flip. Basically, I mean,
load up on Sam, and then, one hinky
on Genevieve, probably. RACHEL:
 I'm a little nervous
 about doing the split vote. The biggest concern
 with this alliance of five is just the idea that someone
or... someone could flip. 'Cause I could always block,
too, if I have to. Don't we...
We need your block for six. RACHEL:
 And then also, I could use this Block a Vote
 so that if there is any kind of shenanigans
with an idol, we still get to decide who goes home
 between Sam and Genevieve. Oh, my God,
if this actually works... If this actually works,
I will die. I will die. GENEVIEVE:
 In my heart, I hope it works. In my brain, I mean, how could it? There's so many ways
it could go wrong. Let's run through all the ways
 Operation Italy is a bust. One: the split vote doesn't actually fall the way that
 we think it's gonna fall. Well, I also think,
we don't need to split it because if we tell Genevieve -it's her, she'll play it.
-TEENY: Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 Two: we need the stars
 to align, and Rachel not
 to play her Block a Vote. Three: what if Andy
 gets cold feet? I mean, Rachel was the hit. Is Caroline enough, or will he be tempted
 just to take out Sam and I and preserve his placement
 in the underdogs? Beyond that, we need Caroline-- who knows her name
is out there-- to not have anything, as well, because if she's nervous,
 maybe she'll protect herself. GENEVIEVE:
In my head, I'm doing the math, and, uh, it's grim,
 to say the least. There are more ways
 this can go wrong than ways it can go right. Yo u kn ow yo u wa nt a b ur ge r. So make it

of our jury. Okay, let's start
with the reward challenge. Sam, you win it.
It comes with a big reward. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Go to the sanctuary, Italian food,
you're gonna spend the night and you get letters from home. So, winning that reward comes with strategic power and strategic risk. You chose Andy and Genevieve
to go with you. So, walk me through
how that went at the sanctuary. SAM:
Yeah, I mean, it was all of your wishes of what you want
on a Survivor reward. But as good as it feels
for yourself, as good as it feels to give
somebody that opportunity to, like, have that day, you're also the person
taking that away from four other people. PROBST:
What was the sanctuary like for you, Genevieve? Can I give you a bit of a longer
answer to this question? -Sure.
-So, when I came into this game, I was Genevieve the person
and Genevieve the player. And before I knew it, I put up, like, a little wall to make it
easier to think strategically, and I thought I was blocking out
all the bad feelings. But what I was doing
was keeping them in. The letters from home gave me just the perspective
I needed. It made me
feel like myself again. It reminded me you are better off
if you connect with people. It was the first time today
that I felt the value of community here. So, it was a very meaningful experience for me. PROBST:
Andy, Genevieve shared a very personal experience
at the sanctuary. How was it for you? Well, first of all,
I mean, I resonate with what Genevieve is saying. I mean, we have our games, and we have our journeys,
and they're intertwined. So, choosing who you're gonna
bring on something like that-- it's a game decision,
but we see beyond the game when we're letting each other
into our home lives and the people who love us. It's just undeniable
how much it meant. PROBST:
Teeny, you have the reward on one part of this. That's the strategic decision
that Sam makes. But then you hear the impact on these humans
that you've been living with in this jungle
with this community while playing against them, but the result is the same. You weren't chosen. TEENY:
Here's the thing, Jeff. I don't think it's a secret
that I came into this game, and I really didn't have
an emotional wall up. Uh, the way
that I approach this is by connecting with other people,
being open, being myself. It's the only way
that I've ever been able to survive in any situation. And so, not being chosen was, oddly, an opportunity for me to strategically think
about my placement in this game, why I wasn't chosen,
who was chosen, and a path forward.
So, it sort of reversed me
out of this emotional... ...rut I have been in
in the game. Caroline, that is fascinating that you can have
such different experiences as a result of one challenge. Absolutely.
I love Teeny's mindset. I feel like there were a lot
of opportunities in us not being chosen. The people who are left behind
are in the majority. We have so much time to think, so much time
to talk all to ourselves. PROBST:
Sue, the words from Teeny and Caroline
certainly sound foreboding. Like, "Oh, go ahead. "Have your little "reward and your nice journey. The four of us
will be back at camp plotting your demise." -(Sue laughs)
-I mean, am I wrong? No, you're not wrong. I think the part
that got me was, I pictured... getting those letters. So, it's painful, but it didn't kill me. It made me stronger. -Hmm.
-SUE: And that's what I love about this game, is that we're all hitting low notes, but we're coming back
feeling more empowered to say, "You know what? I got to take the reins
by the horn..." You know, the horn, whatever
it is, whatever it's called, and just, like, go with this and just keep pulling forward. And that's what it did for me. PROBST:
Teeny, would it be reasonable to assume that maybe
the four of you-- Sue, Rachel, Caroline and yourself-- taking out one
of the three of them? I think you'd be stupid not to have that thought
cross your mind if you're one
of the three of them. Just like I think
we'd be stupid to not think that the three of them
are coming up with a plan that's against one of us. But the thing is, seven people, I think, have three questions
in their mind. One of them is, "Who can I beat sitting next to
at Final Tribal Council?" The second one is, "How do I get
to Final Tribal Council? "Who is in my way? "Whether I'm not a part
of their endgame plans, they're not a part of mine." And the third one, I think,
"Is our perception "of who the biggest threat
to win is "the same as their perception of who the biggest threat
to win is?" And I think the phrase "perception is reality" in Survivor is as common
as hearing "bless you" in response to a sneeze.
Like, it is something that is almost just desensitized at this point, regardless of who was on the reward
and who was at camp. It's something that's wheeling
through all of our minds the second
we're all back together. PROBST:
Rachel, you were nodding. Yeah. I mean, I agree.
This is day 22. The only thing you have to do
is think about your endgame and who you want to be with. Can you trust those people that
you think want to be with you, that you want to be with? It's a cyclical thing
that my brain just continues to mull over
all day, every day. PROBST:
So, Sue, after today's
immunity challenge, Rachel wins her second necklace, is safe again,
you all get back to camp. What was the vibe today? Today was almost
like a more relaxed vibe. People weren't scurrying off
and going, having conversations. It was very different than
what you would normally expect. PROBST:
Andy, does that line up
with what you saw, that it was kind of
an easygoing afternoon? It's the classic Survivor thing.
Like, everyone's sitting pretty,
and everything's so easy. What's really going on? Like, where's the catch, right? CAROLINE:
But it's not that
we're happy-go-lucky and relaxed. I think what you're seeing is a plan being acted out that doesn't need
much talking to act out. TEENY:
Jeff, the thing is, a lot of us have proved to each other
trust already, and a pecking order
has been decided, and that's that. PROBST:
Wow. Andy, if that's true, that's terrifying if you're not
in on the vote because it's essentially saying,
"You won't change us. We've already talked through it,
and we have a decision." I mean, typically, I would say, conventional wisdom says
if you're on the outside of it, you got to be
tearing walls down, you got to be, like, going nuts. And so, obviously, I don't think anyone wants
to go home tonight, but at the same time, I don't
think everyone feels secure, and it's either
going to be resulting in something kind of cut-and-dry
that people have accepted or it's masking something that I can't see right now. PROBST:
Sam, are you expecting that it might be you tonight? Yeah, I mean,
I think it's kind of been, like, I'm at the end of my rope
in a lot of ways, and I've been hanging on as I get closer down,
like, the knots. Uh, and the reward didn't help. And so, it's a really
powerless feeling tonight, for me. PROBST:
How you feeling right now, Genevieve,
getting ready to vote? I'm totally fine and confident,
in a weird way. Not on how the vote's gonna go, but just of where I'm at. And tonight's vote isn't about just
scraping by for me. I'm swinging
for the fences because I don't want to just
get to sixth and go home. I want to try,
like everyone else is, and I know
what I want to happen, so that's what I'm gonna
try and make happen. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Sue, you're up. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Let's see if Operation Italy
really is a thing. Either way, one of us gonna be
sleeping with the fishes. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. PROBST:
All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Sam. Genevieve. One vote Sam,
one vote Genevieve. Caroline.
We're tied. One vote Sam,
one vote Genevieve, one vote Caroline. Sam. That's two votes Sam,
one vote Genevieve, one vote Caroline. Genevieve.
We're tied again. Two votes Sam,
two votes Genevieve, one vote Caroline. Caroline.
We're tied. Two votes Sam,
two votes Genevieve, two votes Caroline,
one vote left. Twelfth person voted out
of Survivor 47 and the fifth member
of our jury: Caroline. Need to bring me your torch. Okay. -That was really
well done, you guys.
-Good game. -Good game.
-GENEVIEVE: Good game, Caroline. It's been an honor
playing with all of you. Wow. (laughs) Caroline, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches,
head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by

 Next time, on a two-part season finale of Survivor... ANDY:
 I am in a grand conspiracy to take over the game. -Isn't this friggin' crazy?
-I'm so mad. SAM:
 I see betrayal, I see fear. GENEVIEVE:
 This island isn't big enough
 for the both of us. RACHEL:
 We are going to clash,
 and we're gonna see who comes out alive. MANU:
