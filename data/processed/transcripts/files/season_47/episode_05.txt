SUE: I was the murderer,
 and now I'm trying to cover my tracks. I'm gonna kill Jeff. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... -I don't think
Andy's gonna be loyal to me.
-Why? SIERRA:
Sam wants to work with Andy, but I want to stick
 with the three girls. We're just bickering
 like a friggin' old married couple. Yeah. KYLE:
 Gabe's gonna want me
 to flip on Tiyana, and there's no way in hell that I'm gonna try to go after her. ANDY:
 We can agree
to play these amulets together, and they would have the effect of a hidden immunity idol. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 I don't want to just
 be going along with plans. So maybe it's time to stop
 going along with Kishan's plan and make Kishan the plan. Kishan, the tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ TEENY:
 I feel like I don't even know
 what happened tonight. I've been bamboozled. I've been betrayed,
I've been humbled. Walking into Tribal, I was
 expecting the vote to be Rome. But in one fell swoop, uh, I've been blindsided
and I've lost Kishan, who I consider
to be my number one, end-all, be-all in this game
above anybody else. A little bit. I'll be all right. TEENY:
Why? What's going on? Teeny, did you know
about the plan? I did know about the plan. Is there a reason
you didn't tell me, though? Because I didn't have a vote
or any way to control it. ROME:
I thought
you had my back, though. I do, but, like... How can you say that if you know
it's gonna be me tonight and then you don't tell me? TEENY:
 It's hard to say what this means for me
moving forward. You know,
my first thought is, like, "How close was it to being me? "How far on the bottom am I? Can I crawl back up?" I really don't know. Like, can you be
straight-up with me? Was there a debate? Like... No. No. No. No. -I feel that no matter...
-You are right in the middle. You're not at the bottom. Rome and Sol are on the bottom. You and me are in the middle, because they both want
to work with us, and they don't want
to work with each other. Rome doesn't want
to work with me. The idea to vote out Kishan
 was mine, and I knew
 I had to vote him out. It was better for my game. He is the player
that is the threat that you don't see
until it's too late. And I just couldn't
 take that chance. TEENY:
Like... He's pissed off at you tonight.
He's gonna be ... Well, what do I say
to him, dude? Because I didn't come up
with that plan. -No.
-I was told the plan. I was also told the plan. GENEVIEVE:
 At this point, I feel good that I've done the damage
control I need to do with Teeny. And now I have Rome,
who really trusts me, because I tipped him off and saved him
from going home tonight. So, I think
I'm in a good position. Like, from the bottom
of my heart, okay? But I want you to know
I feel freed from the shackles of, like, Kishan being a person
in this game that I have to, like,
make decisions with or be associated with. I do feel liberated. And, I mean, I do, too,
because, like, you know,
when I came into this game, I said that I wanted
to get an alliance, and I want
to do everything possible -to get that alliance
as far as possible.
-Mm-hmm. And so that's why tonight, I was more hurt
by Kishan than anything. I thought that I had
 a solid alliance with me, Genevieve, Kishan and Teeny. So, the second that I heard
 Kishan put my name out there, I knew that that trust with me
and Kishan was out the window, was sayonara, goodbye. And that's why I had
 absolutely zero problems stealing his vote tonight,
writing his name down twice and seeing him
get his torch snuffed. I feel like Teeny
 most definitely feels like she's on the bottom right now, and that's exactly
 how I want her to feel. So, yes, Teeny,
you can be remorseful. You can be, you know, sad that you were left out
 of the vote, but at the end of the day, that trust is 100% broken. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on in! ♪ ♪ Wow. Tuku, Gata,

for today's challenge because we're doing
something different. Oh, my God. Holy cow. Here's how it works.
We're gonna do a random draw -across all three tribes
-Wow. and form two teams of seven. These are teams
just for this challenge. -Wow.
-PROBST: You will compete together,
and if you win, you will celebrate together
with the reward. -Wow.
-Wow.
-Oh. -Wow.
-PROBST: All right, before we get to the draw, let me
walk you through the challenge. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna race under an obstacle,
 collecting keys along the way. You'll use those keys
 to unlock a ladder. You'll then work together
 to maneuver the ladder until it's free. You'll use the ladder
 to collect five balls from an overhead structure. Race to the finish,
 where you will attempt to land those balls
 into five different targets. First team of seven
to finish wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -(all assenting)
-PROBST:
The winning seven will be taken to the sanctuary... -Are you kidding me?
-(all exclaiming) ...Where good things happen for a brand-new Survivor reward. It's called
the Survivor Social Hour. Here's how it works.
You're gonna barbecue hot dogs. -What?! You're kidding.
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh! Play a little Survivor cornhole. (all exclaiming) PROBST:
And you will also have the advantage of opportunity. The opportunity to hang out
with players you don't know and maybe forge bonds that
will help you later in the game. Losers, I got nothing for you. You will head back to your camp
and then hope that somebody will share
with you what really went down. -Worth playing for?
-(all assenting) All right, then.
Let's draw for teams. GABE: This reward is something
 totally unprecedented, and the biggest advantage
 of it is you're getting this opportunity
 to really cross-pollinate and mingle
with the other two tribes. If you are blue,
go to the blue mat. If you're yellow,
go to the yellow mat. GABE:
 So, it's huge strategically, because we know how close
 we are to the merge. And any time
 you can get with people who you're not
 very familiar with right now is gonna be invaluable. All right, so let's look
at these temporary teams. For today only, we have Anika, Sol, Rome, Gabe, Andy,
Sierra and Genevieve. Over here in yellow, we have Sue, Kyle,
Teeny, Sam, Rachel, Tiyana and Caroline. So, both groups have members
from all three tribes, which means, if you win,
this will truly be an advantage because, for the first time, you will have a sense
of what's going on everywhere. -Wow.
-Wow. All right, give you a minute
to strategize. -We'll get it on.
Let's do this!
-(whooping) All right, here we go.
For reward at the sanctuary. Survivors ready? Go! First you got
to get under that obstacle, and you are untying bags. Every player is responsible
for one bag. You cannot grab more than one. Once you have a bag,
get to your mat. Once everybody's at your mat,
you can move on. -TIYANA: Y'all got this!
-Good job, team. Everybody funneling out quickly.
Got to get all seven there. Go, Blue! You're good! -Go, Yellow! You're good.
-Come on, come on, come on. Go. Now you're looking
for three keys. -(overlapping chatter)
-PROBST: Once you have all three keys, you can try
to unlock the ladder. You're good, Blue! All right. Go, girl. PROBST:
Yellow, you're good. GABE:
Oh, you're good. You have to untie.
You have to untie. PROBST:
It is Blue in the early lead.
Their ladder is unlocked. Now you got
to maneuver that ladder through a tricky maze. It looks a lot easier
than it is. Do you have the rest? We got it. Yellow has their ladder
unlocked. Yellow has some momentum now. It is Yellow in the lead. Blue is stuck. -That's it.
-There we go. There we go. -Keep pushing a little bit more.
Yeah.
-Yeah. Good job. PROBST:
Yellow can feel it. They have figured this out. Good teamwork, guys. Yellow has the ladder free.
You can move on. -Right here.
-It is Yellow now in the lead. -Down. All right.
-Okay. -PROBST: One person going up.
-(overlapping chatter) PROBST:
It's gonna be Kyle
going up the ladder. -Unclip.
-It's so steady. PROBST:
There's one. There's two.
Kyle can reach three. -Down he goes.
-Now you got to make just one move
to get the other two. Blue still working
on freeing up their ladder. SOL:
Lift up, Rome. There you go. Yellow now increasing
their lead. Kyle quickly unclips
those balls. -Can we drop it?
-Drop it. Do that, do that, do that. That's how you do it
on Survivor. Drop one in every slot. You got two rebounders up here.
Let's go! It's gonna be Teeny taking
the first spot for Yellow. -Just shoot. You're okay.
-PROBST:
Rachel and Sue gonna rebound. Wow. -Just misses.
-SIERRA: Nice, guys. Good work. PROBST:
Blue has their ladder free. -You're good, Blue!
-They're still on their first. Get it up and get one person
up the ladder. -Okay, everyone, stabilize.
-All day, Rome, all day. -Stabilize!
-It's gonna be Rome going up. You're unclipping, Rome. -KYLE: Soft touch.
-Yay! KYLE:
There you go. PROBST:
Teeny scores the first basket
for Yellow. Caroline now taking her spot. -Hold up. Hold it tight.
-PROBST: Rome taking a lot of time on that second bag. SIERRA:
Nice, Rome! PROBST: Kyle whipped through it.
There's Rome with the third. -And a big leap.
-Go, go, go, go, go. PROBST:
Now it's Gabe going up. -Go, move.
-Go. Okay. -Still got me?
-Yes, yes, it's stabilized. They're gonna swap out. Yellow has one. Caroline going for two.
Just misses. Gabe working for that final bag. Unclip it. He's got it. Drop the ladder,
and you're good. Get all your bags in. -Go! Go! Go!
-In the hole,
in the hole, in the hole. Okay, there it is.
That's it. Caroline scores
the second for Yellow! Here comes Tiyana. Gabe gonna take
the first shot for Blue. -Yeah!
-Yeah! PROBST:
Gabe scores the first for Blue! We've got Yellow with two,
Blue with one. -RACHEL: You got this, Tiyana.
-PROBST: There goes Tiyana -with a huge toss.
-KYLE: Yeah. Yup. Yup. PROBST:
Just out. One more. PROBST:
There goes Sierra. -SOL: Ooh, get in there!
-SIERRA: Yes! PROBST:
Sierra scores a second for Blue. We are tied, two-two. CAROLINE:
You got it, Tiyana. Come on. PROBST:
Tiyana, deep breath. -Nice launch.
That looks good.
-KYLE: Yes. Yes! There it is!
Yellow has their third. Here comes Kyle with the fourth. Andy going short. -In and out.
-Oh, God. -KYLE: Oh.
-PROBST: Here goes Kyle. -Yeah!
-(cheering) PROBST:
Kyle with a huge toss. Scores it.
That is the fourth for Yellow. It is now Sam with the fifth
and final ball for Yellow. -Andy scores the third.
-Good work, Andy! Here comes Sol now working
on that fourth ball for Blue. Sam's way back.
It's a long ways away. Takes a lot of touch
and a lot of strength. Can Sam close it out for Yellow?
In and out. Sol trying to tie it up for Blue
to give them a shot. -In and out.
-So close, Sol. There goes Sam for the win. Is that it?
It is! -(cheering)

 about this is, like, coming this close to the merge,
 this is a prime opportunity for people to start creating
new bonds and figuring out the different cracks
 that exist in other tribes. TEENY:
I feel like we've got a lot
of eating and a lot -of talking to get to.
-Yeah. So we need you
to give us the downlow. -Yeah. I'll fill you guys in.
-SUE: Oh, yeah. -SAM: Do you want to start?
-TEENY: Yeah. So, basically, we get to Tribal,
and I just start getting this, like, weird feeling,
and they all voted together. Oh, damn. I'm sorry, Teeny. So now you feel
like you're on the bottom? TEENY:
I'm just nervous all around. I feel like
this might be my last supper. Like, that's where
I'm at right now. That sucks, Teeny. I'm so excited
 for this Survivor Social Hour. I'm here with Sam from Gata, and we're getting to bond with other people on other tribes
for the very first time. If we hit merge, having as much information
 as possible is gonna be really good for my game. SUE:
So, tell us about you guys. -RACHEL: Yeah.
-SAM: Yeah. It's been weird. We're the weirdest
kumbaya tribe ever. -We go everywhere together.
-Do you really? You don't split off at all? -Not really.
-SAM: We go everywhere together. SUE:
I felt like the only thing
that we heard was that you and Sierra were,
like, sort of running the show. -No. It's crazy.
-RACHEL: Mm. SAM:
 Sierra and I have a very
 secret bond with one another. And so it's really frustrating
to know that two tribes might already
suspect that going into the merge. And that perception is very dangerous for my game. TIYANA:
I'm not gonna lie.
This is probably the best-case scenario
for me right now of the Tuku being here. This is not gonna blow up
anyone else's game. Gabe has been the one looking
for idols this entire time. Like, if anyone's gonna find it,
it's gonna be Gabe, and he's alone right now.
I'm pretty sure he's looking for it at
this current moment as we speak. Oh, shoot. It kind of worked out perfectly
because the one person that I'm a little sketched out
about is not with us. I know that Gabe has
 thrown my name out there, so now I can make sure that Gabe is the first name that
kind of goes to people's heads when they think of people
who are suspicious and that they can't trust
post-merge. It's a perfect play for my game. Gabe threw his idol
at our first Tribal Council. He found... Wait.
He already found an idol? -And he played it.
-What?! TIYANA:
None of us knew
that he had the idol. SUE:
 Tiyana just opens up,
 talking about Gabe, literally throwing him
 under the bus. It was shocking. -I go off of vibes.
-Yeah. No matter how many times,
like, me and Gabe talk, it feels a little iffy. SUE:
 Gabe is basically
 my number one ally. And Tiyana put a target on
Gabe's back 100% for the merge. TIYANA:
Yeah, Sue. Yeah! -SUE: Almost.
-Ooh. That was close. This is, like, my second sport--
cornhole. -Oh. (laughs, whoops)
-Be, like... Oh! -Oh, yeah!
-SAM: Kyle! It's nice. It takes us away
from the game a little bit. -Right?
-KYLE: Yeah. RACHEL:
How do you feel about the people -here on your tribe?
-I think
the people here are good. I think there's still
some personalities that kind of rub each other
the wrong way. Some people go out,
 play a game of cornhole. I decide
to keep playing Survivor. RACHEL:
I haven't talked to Sue at all. She is my number one.
I love to work with her, -and whoever I'm working with...
-Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Amazing. CAROLINE:
 The Survivor Social Hour--
 it was so good. I'm definitely feeling good vibes
from both Teeny and Rachel. Rachel is someone who
I just feel comfortable around. So, do you feel good
with the women? CAROLINE:
I feel really good
with the women. So, I could see us working well
in a bunch of different ways. -Yeah. -CAROLINE: Teeny, on the other hand,
I've already met and established a great relationship
with at the journey. I'm over the moon.
I'm absolutely thrilled. ♪ ♪ SOL: Yeah. ROME: When we lose
 the reward challenge, it is the worst feeling in the world. I would have loved
 to be on that reward, but I had to come back hungry,
 knowing that I'm gonna be eating coconut some more
 and have nothing but water. It was definitely,
definitely rough. ROME:
 But the good thing is,
 with Teeny not at camp, it definitely opened up the door for me to start talking with Sol about potentially
 getting out Teeny. It's just gonna be about convincing him
that he can fully trust me. So, I've got no problem telling Sol everything,
 because at the end of the day, you share knowledge with people. That's how you build trust
in this game. Teeny now has the opportunity
to go talk with everybody, she's got food in her belly. She's gonna be a serious threat
post-merge. And this is the other thing. Teeny did get
a three-way amulet, so, if her and the other two people with the amulets use it
together, it counts as an idol. Fart. I am in complete shock. Teeny has an amulet which I was not aware of. And here's the other thing is, Genevieve has told me before that she doesn't want
to work with you long-term, and she'd rather work
with Teeny. But I want to work with you more
than I want to work with Teeny. SOL:
 After last night's vote,
 I thought that Genevieve and I could
 build something strong. So that was pretty hard. Rome is vomiting information
to me, none of it that I knew. And that's where
I came back to reality. It's like, "Sol, you don't know anything
that's going on right now." That sucks to hear. Coming in here, I have over 20 years sales experience. I have been very,
very successful in my selling career,
reading people, convincing people to do things. So, I'm getting a big dose
of humble pie right now. ROME:
 I know that you want Sol out -more than you want Teeny out.
 -GENEVIEVE: Yeah. ROME:
 So, hear me out. Sol, at the end of the day,
when it comes to actions, even though
I might not be fond of the guy, -actions speak louder
than the words in this game.
-Yeah. So, he has shown more loyalty
to us than Teeny. GENEVIEVE:
 Right now, Rome is very chaotic. Even though we only lost
a reward challenge, it's very reminiscent
of the scramble that would happen after losing
 an immunity challenge, which... (scoffs) Yes, he's tried to come for me,
things like that. -But at the end of the day,
he voted with me last night.
-Yeah. He was the one
that brought up Teeny, and I think that that's
our better long-term play. GENEVIEVE:
 Rome is saying that Sol is pitching Teeny
 hard to him. But out of all
the Lavo members left standing, Teeny is the one
 that is just easiest for me to work with, so... Ugh! Oh. -You got me, girl.
-Hmm? -You got me.
-What does that mean? -Rome said that?
-Yeah. That's very different
than what he said to me. -Oh.
-He just said
you were pitching Teeny. -Oh, no.
-That's really interesting. Huh. My conversation with Sol-- I was a little caught off guard. I learned that Rome has been very naughty
and told Sol that I don't want
 to work with Sol long-term. I mean, I know I've said it, we all know I've said it, but I don't want Sol
to know that I have said it. -So, you really weren't
pitching Teeny to him?
-Absolutely not. GENEVIEVE:
 And not only that, but Rome was the one
 targeting Teeny. It's not Sol. So, if he's not
telling me everything, his value to me goes down and his danger level goes up. And at some point,
that will tip the scales, and it won't make sense for me to keep Rome
 in this game anymore, and the scales be tippin'. Ma rs ha ll s bu ye rs h us tl e fo r th e la te st t re nd s, from fashion... Double denim is back. Got it! to beauty,

and told me, "We heard that you and Sierra
 are running things back at your camp." SAM:
 So I asked Sue if they had heard anything
about our tribe dynamic, basically just trying
to play dumb. And then Sue was like,
"Well, we heard that you and Sierra are kind of
running things over there." And that's what...
I shot that down. -Yeah. Good.
-It's just like, that's... -I'm happy you shot that down.
-And I was like, -"I don't feel like Sierra
and even talk all that much."
-Yup. I was a little bothered to learn
 that it was brought up that Sam and I were on, you know, the top
and dominating the Gata tribe. This is not good for my game,
 but I have a few options. I know I have Rachel, Anika, and myself--
 the breadwinners-- we're this tight, core alliance. So, first off, Caroline said,
"The women are together "and we're basically just, like, waiting to see
what to do with the men." But Sam and I have
a very tight alliance with Andy. ANDY:
I'm sure Sam filled you in. -Right.
-The three of us--
that's secret. -Right.
-That is confidential. SIERRA:
 I feel like
 I could go either way. Can either kick it with the boys
 or with the girls. So, I'm like, "What is best for my game?" (sighs) I know I have a lot of power
 right now, but it's kind of stressing me out. TEENY:
I'm not complaining whatsoever, but everyone got one hot dog,
there were no condiments. -It was like...
-SOL: Oh, really? -Yeah. There wasn't, like,
potato salad and that.
-Yeah. TEENY: During
 the Survivor Social Hour, I told the other tribes the entire, whole truth. I told them
 that I was on the bottom and I'm a little bit scared. So, I decide to tell my tribe
a minorly-tweaked version of what I told everyone
at the Social Hour. About our Tribal,
I told them what happened, except for I didn't say
he stole Kishan's vote. Basically, I wanted to make them feel like I didn't give up
 any information. I did not get a chance
to one-on-one talk to Sue, but she seems like a sweetheart. Who else was there? Tiyana. ROME: I feel like Teeny almost got no information when she could have got
way more information. That's just appalling to me, so, there's a lot of red flags
at this moment with Teeny in the game. He told that to your face? Hundred percent. TEENY:
So, the second Rome walks away, Genevieve and Sol
start telling me that Rome went absolutely nuts when they got back
 from the challenge, and that is music to my ears. -And then he goes,
"Teeny has the amulet idol."
-Okay. -Figured.
-Um... Yeah. TEENY:
 After last night, I was so nervous about
 my life in this game, and now the tables have turned
 a little bit. Because of the madness
that occurred today, I feel like Sol and Genevieve
 finally see the light on what I've known, basically, since the beginning
of this game, which is that
 Rome's unpredictability and manner of playing this game
 is just too chaotic to have, long-term. I want him gone. TIYANA:
I'm not even gonna say "if." -When we get to the merge,
all of us...
-Uh-huh. Those guys are scattering,
like, friggin', like... -Like, I swear to God.
-KYLE: Yeah.
Oh, they're running. SUE: We come home, and I felt horrible knowing that Tiyana put a target
 on Gabe's back in front of the whole Social Hour. TIYANA:
I'm just gonna hop
in the water really fast, then -I'll go crabbing.
-Yeah. And then, also,
cutting up coconuts for Gabe. And I want him to do,
like, literally nothing. SUE:
 I think Tiyana did it
 intentionally so that others will look at him
 as a threat. So, if she can't take him
out with us, she wants him gone. And that makes me pretty upset
 because he's basically my number one ally. CAROLINE:
 My strategy right now
is trying to keep options open, but Tuku is falling apart. It's looking
more and more likely all five of us might be
making it to the merge. And I'm just thinking,
 "How can we work together?" CAROLINE:
 My fear is that Gabe has all trust gone
 with Tiyana because she threw him under the bus. I'm trying to be the mother hen and help us all form
 a cohesive, wonderful family. And they're all running away. And I'm like, "Let me try
 to get one back in the coop." I want her to tell Gabe the full truth. 'Cause I'm worried about Gabe
finding out about it. -About?
-About what you said. I just don't see a world
in which if he's at the merge, he doesn't find out
about what happened. 'Cause I'll be honest.
I don't know if Gabe will trust you
after this. TIYANA:
 Caroline suggested to me that I come clean with Gabe. I didn't feel, in that moment, that I needed to apologize, but if I ignore their advice, no one will trust me
 because they know I'm not listening to them. TIYANA:
 So, if Caroline wants me
 to apologize to Gabe and it would make Gabe
feel happy, it just seems like
the right thing to do. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. GABE: Tiyana said that she had
 a private conversation with two other people, that I played the idol, but I don't believe it
 in the slightest. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. But I also wanted
to be completely honest. -That was it. Like...
-Uh-huh. The whole time, I'm just like, "Mm-hmm." -Uh-huh.
-"Yeah." -Yeah.
-"Okay." -Okay. -Tiyana, I've never once trusted anything
that comes out of your mouth. It was just that
I played the idol, it wasn't anything about, like,
my game or anything? -No. I literally only told
-Okay. -Rachel and Teeny about that.
-Uh-huh. Okay. -Don't worry about it,
we're totally cool.
-Dude. Gabe. We're totally cool.
Don't worry about it. -I really am, like, so sorry.
-No worries. Uh-huh. I get my BS apology from Tiyana. That doesn't make me feel good. I-I think if Tiyana was not
compelled to apologize to me, then she would not have. -Mm-hmm.
-She said that she only talked to Rachel and Teeny, and it was in a private
conversation with them that she said that
I played my idol. GABE: I'm angry at how open and brazen Tiyana was about
 throwing my name out there. But I've been ready
 to cut Tiyana out for a long time. I want
 to crush her Survivor dreams. I want to watch her torch
get snuffed out and I want to smile

-Good morning, Jeff. Morning, sunshine. Come on in, Lavo. Down to four. (chickens clucking) Here comes a very slow-moving Gata tribe. With their chickens. PROBST:
Got all three? Huh. -SIERRA: All three, Jeff.
-ANIKA: All three. Hmm.
This gonna be interesting. Well, let's just start
with the obvious. Are they family members
that travel with you now or is this about something else? You know, Jeff,
we, as a tribe, would like to -propose a negotiation with you.
-I love a negotiation. -SIERRA: I know you do.
-Tell me what you're thinking. Well, the thing is, we-- You know, we saw that
second place got the six eggs, -initially. They
-PROBST: Okay. popped out, in two and a half
days, three eggs. Two of them shattered
before we could even get to 'em. 'cause they just pop out. PROBST:
So, first of all, Sam,
is the reason you've not chosen
to eat the chickens a moral decision? Uh, not everybody
was comfortable with the idea
of eating the chickens. -Okay.
-SAM: So, you want to make sure everybody's comfortable
on our tribe. Eating the chickens--
not really an option for us. And they kind of suck
at making eggs. So you're saying
you want to trade -the chickens for eggs?
-Correct. -SAM: Yes.
-PROBST: Okay. -What's the offer?
-SAM: I think two dozen
sounds pretty good, Jeff. PROBST:
So, 24 eggs. Okay. On Survivor, we see the chicken as a dilemma in this sense: you can eat the chicken or you can use the eggs
from the chicken. Those eggs are gonna
be hatched over 16 days, so that's a little bit
like winning the lottery, and you get paid
a little every year. You want to put all your eggs
in one basket. You want to get paid right now. That comes at a reduced price. So, you're asking for 24 eggs, which is eight per chicken. I'll counter
at five per chicken. That's 15 total eggs. -Twenty.
-PROBST: Twenty. Shall we meet in the middle? Which is never
great negotiating, but I'm willing to do it.
18. -Let's do it.
-PROBST: Eighteen eggs. -Done, you have a deal.
-Deal.
-Deal, Jeff. -Thank you.
-(whoops)
-PROBST: All right. Eighteen eggs will
be waiting for you back at camp. -The chickens will stay with me.
-All right. -SAM: Thanks.
-ANIKA: Thanks, Jeff.
-Good for you guys. -PROBST: All right.
Shall we get to
-Good for you guys. today's immunity challenge? -(all assenting)
-PROBST: All right, first things first.
Got to take back the idols. Thank you. Thank you. Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna drag a very heavy net-- Hey! Sorry. -What happened?
-SIERRA: He's just -biting my foot, and I
-Pecked her toes. -take care of him.
-PROBST: That's what family members who are
left on the side of the road do. SIERRA:
They got to go. If you...
I'll just step away. -Sorry.
-PROBST: All right. For today's challenge,
you're gonna drag a very heavy net full of coconuts and sandbags
 along the course. Along the way, you're gonna collect more sandbags
 and more coconuts, making it even heavier. When you get to the finish,
you're gonna throw the sandbags at a puzzle wall until you knock off every block, then race to reassemble
 the exact same puzzle. First two tribes to finish
win immunity, safe from the vote, will not be sent home.
Losers: Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the fifth person voted out of Survivor 47.
All right, we have sit-outs.
Gata, one extra person who you can
sit out. It can be anybody, because everybody participated
in the last challenge. -Jeff, I'm gonna sit out.
-Anika gonna sit out for Gata. -Tuku, one extra person.
-I'm gonna sit out. Sue, you're gonna sit this one
out. All right, sit outs, take a spot on the bench.
Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize.
We'll get it on. Here we go. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! First, you got to drag that bag to your first mat. Yep, yep, we're on it. -Go. Hey, go, go, go!
-You're good, you're good, -you're good.
-SUE: Good job, guys! Now you're gonna saw a rope. We've got Kyle for Tuku, -Sol for Lavo,
-Nice, Sol. Andy for Gata. Come on, Gata! Let's go, Andy. RACHEL:
Turn it around, turn it around. -SAM: Flip it.
You need the blade.
-SIERRA: Yeah, that one. -There you go.
-(panting) Kyle working it for Tuku. -Come on, baby.
-Yes, Kyle. Kyle has his for Tuku. Good job, Kyle. PROBST:
Now you got
to get all your coconuts and your sandbags into your bag. -Don't throw them so hard, guys.
-Okay. -Yeah. There it is, Sol. Go!
-Go! Go! Sol has his. Andy, still working for Gata. Keep cutting, Andy. -Aah! Aah!
-Come on, Andy! -ANIKA: Good job!
-PROBST: Andy struggling. -SAM: Come on, Andy.
We need you, bud.
-(grunting) -Let's go.
-One, two. PROBST: Tuku thinks
they have all their sandbags. -You're good!
-We're good. Hurdle.
Hit it hard, hit it hard. -(grunting)
-PROBST: Tuku in the lead,
still. Tuku at the second stage. SUE:
Come on, guys! PROBST: Got to get
all the coconuts in that bag. Try to get as far back
as you can. -All right, we're good.
-Lavo, you're good!
-Go! -(groaning)
-PROBST: Those bags are heavy. -Andy still working.
-SIERRA: Keep pushing, Andy! You got this. -(grunting)
-PROBST: This is a huge
early setback -for Gata.
-You got it. PROBST:
Gata has theirs! Finally. They got a lot of time
to catch up now. -Help put them in the bag.
-SIERRA: I need help! Once you have all the coconuts,
you can move on. Go. Tuku, you're good. GABE:
Hit it hard, hit it hard,
hit it hard! (grunting) PROBST:
That bag is very heavy now. One, two, three, pull! Tuku doing a nice job
working together. One, two, three, pull! It is Tuku in the lead,
then Lavo. Rome, help him lift it. -PROBST: Gata has a lot of time
to make up.
-Let's go. -One, two, three, pull!
-One, two, three, pull! Tuku now can empty the bag. -Sandbags in the...
-I'll organize it. Yup. I got coconuts. -(grunting)
-Everyone watch your step. PROBST:
Let's go, Lavo!
That bag is heavy. (grunting) Gata, you're good. Let's go! ANIKA:
Gata, you got this! I believe in you! PROBST:
Let's go, Gata. You're in this. SIERRA:
Keep pushing. Tuku with a huge early lead. Lavo trying to close the gap. Almost there. Five more steps. PROBST:
Once you have every sandbag, then you can start
knocking down your puzzle wall. -That's it.
-Good.
-You're good! Go, Tuku! -Toss it, Caroline. Go.
-I got it. I got it. PROBST:
Anybody can throw. Tiyana up first. (grunting) -Oh.
-Kyle with a toss. It is Gata working
at the second stage. Shoving 'em. PROBST:
Kyle with a big arm. There's a couple of blocks
for Tuku. Good job, guys. You're good, Lavo. It is now Lavo that can start
breaking down their wall. -Got it!
-PROBST:
Kyle with another nice toss. -Nice, Sol!
-PROBST: Sol, wow! Sol knocks five blocks
completely off. And Gata is still
inexplicably working at the second stage. PROBST:
There goes Tiyana. Nice toss. SUE:
Yeah, Tiyana! -Yeah, Sol!
-Sol with another big hit. -Yes, Rome!
-PROBST: Rome with a nice toss. We are neck-and-neck. -Yup.
-Yeah, Sol! Sol with another one. And now it gets harder
to get those bottom blocks off. -Yes!
-Yes, Gabe!
-PROBST: And Gabe for Tuku with a nice hit.
There goes Rome. They're moving them slowly. You have blocks blocking
the blocks. That's a problem. Tuku, you're good.
Start rebuilding. -SUE: Come on, Tuku!
-PROBST: Now you got to get all your pieces back
on your mat. -ANIKA: Go, Gata!
-Push! PROBST:
Gata finally out
of the second stage. Push, dig deep! PROBST:
You're good. Now unload. ANIKA:
You got this, Gata! PROBST:
Tuku working on putting
their puzzle back together. PROBST:
But Lavo has hit a roadblock. It's gonna take a big gun
to move those blocks, 'cause they are jammed up. -Got to get 'em off that table.
-We're so close. -Let's go.
-PROBST: You're good, Gata.
Let's go! Big gun from Sam
knocks off four blocks. Sierra with a nice rocket. Gata's made up a lot of time. It is Lavo slowing down now. That's okay. We can do this. Come on. Everybody's in this now,
'cause we're looking for two. You got this, guys,
you're in it! Another gun from Sam. So frustrating. -Yup. Good. That's it.
-Yup. PROBST:
Tuku with a huge lead right now. -Ready?
-Yup. Yeah.
-Yes. Here comes Sam again
with another toss. Lavo, keep working. They cannot -be touching the frame.
-TEENY: Yeah, Sol! PROBST:
Here comes Andy. SIERRA:
Yeah! -Andy did it! You're good!
-ANIKA: There you go, Andy! A huge comeback from Gata. -One more, one more.
-There goes Rome. -(cheering)
-PROBST: You're good! Let's go, Lavo! -And then this one.
-Yeah. PROBST:
Tuku with another piece,
getting closer. (whooping) You guys ready? -Double-check.
-Jeff! Jeff! -Jeff! Jeff!
-Tuku thinks they have it. -And they do!
-(cheering) Tuku wins immunity,
safe from Tribal Council. -Oh, my God.
-Hey, hey. Lavo and Gata--
they are literally starting on this puzzle
at the exact same time. -This is top left.
-Yeah, that's right.
-Nice. -PROBST: Immunity on the line.
-Yeah, perfect. PROBST:
Somebody going home tonight. Player number five of Survivor 47, say bye-bye. -Face 'em all
the right way, Si. Don't...
-I... They're the right way. No.
Like, this needs to face us. -Yeah, but she needs
to be able to see.
-Hey, no fighting. Gata was dead last
but once again, a huge comeback. Fighting to stay alive
in this game. RACHEL:
Wait, wait, wait,
gimme that one back. I can't see the puzzle if we're facing the pieces
upside down and sideways. -That's it?
-Yeah.
-Yup. Lavo with another piece.
We are still neck-and-neck. You're so close, you're
so close, you're so close! I think something else is wrong. -SOL: Yeah. Yeah.
-There it is. There it is. -Wing needs to go on this side.
-PROBST: This is gonna -come down to the wire.
-ANIKA: You got it, guys! -That's right. That's right.
-ANIKA: You got this! Quick, quick, quick! -One more.
-Jeff!
-Jeff! Lavo thinks they have it.
Get back to your mat. Put it back. Put it back. -Go, go, go!
-Move!
-Sol falls. There you go. You got it. That's it. That's it. PROBST:
You're good! (cheering) Lavo pulls it out
in the last seconds over Gata... ROME:
Oh, thank you! Oh, my God! ...sending Gata back to Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 47. Oh, my gosh. (cries) That was tight. -Wow.
-Wow. PROBST:
Lavo, big, emotional win. Rome, tell me -about the emotion.
-ROME: I mean, we knew coming into today that we're the only tribe where the majority
of us hasn't had anything but coconut
the last six days. We came in knowing that
we're gonna be super low energy, and we just told everyone,
"Just give it our all. "Just put your whole heart
into it and don't give up, "no matter how hard
it might get. Just power through
and try to not go to Tribal." And the fact that we were able
to do it today, it just shows us why you never
give up on Survivor, Jeff. All right, Tuku, congratulations. Immunity is yours. Nobody going home
from your tribe. Lavo, big win indeed. Immunity is yours. And you get your flint back. Let's go. We got fire, man.
Thank you, Jeff. Most importantly, nobody
going home from your tribe. Tuku, grab your stuff, head out, enjoy the night off.
Nobody going home. SIERRA:
Great job. Great job, guys. Lavo, grab your stuff,
head out. -Enjoy the night off from me.
-Thank you. (Teeny sighs) PROBST:
So, Rachel,
the afternoon started off pretty well.
We had a nice negotiation. Eggs waiting for you
back at camp, but the result is -Tribal Council.
-And no way to cook the eggs. The great irony of having -18 eggs back at camp.
-Oh, shoot. Because I'm gonna
take your flint. -You're gonna take our flint.
-All right, Gata, Tribal Council tonight,
where somebody will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing, I will take that flint and your ability to cook. -(sighs)
-All right, grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. -Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff. ANDY: This immunity challenge,
 uh, was a tough one, and after ten days out here,
I can conclude I'm not good at challenges. So, tonight, it could be me. I've been on the bottom for a very long time
 in this game, but I've laid a lot of groundwork
on what could happen if we were
 to go to a Tribal Council. And I feel like this is
 the real start of my game. I'm looking forward to tonight. ♪ ♪ Irresistibly smooth chocolate. To put the world on pause. LINDOR.

 Andy, once again, can't seem to get out of his own way
 in a challenge. At one point,
Andy is sawing the rope with the non-saw part of the saw. You come that close to immunity and then your mind goes,
"Huh. Would have been nice if we would have sawed that rope
just a little bit faster." ANIKA:
 I can't stop thinking about how much
 I want to cook those eggs. -SIERRA: Yup.
-This is the only morning since we got here
that we didn't make a fire. -SIERRA: That sucks.
-Yeah. ANIKA: The fact
 we were able to negotiate for 18 eggs is so major. The only downside is that
 we lost the immunity challenge and had to give away our flint, and therefore, have no fire. -Wash off?

-Yeah. -Does that make sense?
-No, it does. -Yeah.
-Like, numbers. ANDY: After all my efforts,

 I'm selling, that she believes that I truly feel on the bottom. Oh, it would just be...

she underestimates people, and she underestimates me. -I don't feel secure tonight.

free number, so, if at any point today
you're like, -"I need a number for this,"
-Yeah. -you just let me know.
-I mean, I appreciate that. -Yeah.
-And, like, -I don't know
what's happening yet.
-Okay. I know my role. I have a very
specific role to play here if we're gonna blindside Anika. If there is some plan out there,
let me be a part of it. (laughs) Here's how my plan works.
 I want Anika and Rachel to see me as someone feeling
very much on the outs, which they believe I am. So I say to Anika and Rachel, "Pull me into your master plan.
I will be so loyal to you." I want them to respond to that and be like, "Okay,
 the best thing that we can do "to prevent Andy from playing
his Shot in the Dark is to feed him a fake plan." RACHEL:

then we sell him one. SIERRA:

we're making the right decision? We are doing the right thing,

-I mean, what the hell
am I gonna... SAM:
 I think right now,
 Sierra and I are just trying to figure out how to navigate as a pair when both of our individual interests
might be slightly different. Sierra really wants
 to keep Anika around. I know how you're feeling
about looking into her eyes, but, like, this whole, like, "Ani is your best friend" thing is her game. That's what
she's trying to play. I really want
to keep Andy around, but Sierra is my number one. So we have to find a way
 to keep each other calm while we figure out
what the heck we're gonna do. Are you, like,
100% sure Ani can't vote? -Ani 100% can't vote.
-Okay. SIERRA:
 Going into Tribal tonight, Sam and I--
we have to get on the same page. He wants to keep Andy, but is keeping Andy the best for my game?
I know it's probably best for Sam's game,
but is it best for mine? -SAM: I have to figure out
what to do with the idol.
-Your... -'Cause everything...
-That's the thing. -Keeping Andy.
-(Sam stammers) He's now gonna
lose a little trust. He's gonna be like,
"Why did you keep that from me?" -Yeah.
-That's a target on your back. 'Cause he's gonna
tell other people. I know he would
tell other people that. You know that, like, for me,
that's a huge risk. My hidden immunity idol is only
good for my next Tribal Council, which means
it's only good tonight. I have to play it tonight,
but that creates some fireworks. If I play an idol and I've kept it from Andy
 this entire time, how does that impact
my relationship and my trust with him
moving forward? So, maybe the safe move
 is voting out Andy tonight. But I've wanted Anika
 out of the game for a long, long time. Basically, it comes down
to what Sierra and I want to do, who we want
 to take with us further. So, tonight, that's all the power. Yo u al l ha ve a l ot o f mo ne y. I know about 20 of you and you're rich as hell. We're going to

I work hard. I scrape to get by. Donald Trump wants to give
 tax breaks to billionaires, but Kamala Harris has
 plans to help us. She's going to crack
 down on price gouging and cut taxes for
 working people like me. I voted for Donald
 Trump before, but this time I'm
voting for Kamala. FF PAC is responsible for

and talk about the Social Hour reward. Rachel, you were a part of that. What was the most interesting
thing that you learned? Yeah, I mean, we learned
about a few of the dynamics that happened at Tribal. We learned that
Gabe played an idol at the first Tribal Council. That was shocking to us. -SAM: Yeah.
-RACHEL: We also learned
Teeny was blindsided by the Kishan vote. So, yes,
they could be lying, but those would be kind of
weird things to lie about. Sam, what do you think
was the impression -they had of your tribe?
-I mean, I think they bought, like,
everything that we said. We kind of tried
to not give too many details and just be "Gata the
listeners," in the background. PROBST:
Andy, what do you think
about how Sam and Rachel did as spies going out
to get information? I mean, I think
they did an excellent job. I trusted them completely
because we've talked a lot about managing our perception
to the other tribes, and there's a very clear picture
to paint that I'm on the bottom as a result of my
emotional moment on day three at the challenge.
I said things that were, uh, explosive, you could say, but I've made so much headway,
especially socially. I don't think, at the end
of the day, people really care how good I am at a balance beam or sawing a piece of rope. -Well, your tribemates care.
-ANDY: True. True, true. That is...
It's important, but I think what's more
important to my tribe is getting to learn, you know,
what I am made of on the inside, and I-I like what I see. PROBST:
So, Rachel,
this is setting us up nicely for the conversation
about tonight's vote. Who do we vote out and why? RACHEL:
That's the tricky, tricky part of Survivor, where you have to weigh out the pros
and cons of each person. Like, this person
may be really emotional, and they wear their heart
on the sleeve. That could really help you or it can really hurt you,
you know? And so, I wish
I knew the answer, Jeff. -Very tricky.
-(laughs) PROBST:
Sierra, where
do you sit with this? SIERRA:
I mean, I think
it's great to keep individuals who you trust,
you form bonds with, because going into a merge,
which can be a shaky situation, you want to feel strong and
comfortable with your alliances. But I also think
there's 100% a benefit of keeping somebody
who is not exactly as "liked" and fitting in
and gelling with the whole crew because to me, that's a person you want to keep around
because, you know, that's somebody
that's an easy number out come later on in the game. PROBST:
Anika, how about for you? Every Tribal decision
each one of us makes creates a completely
different pathway for our own personal game. There could be
eight billion diff... Well, actually, in this case,
five different pathways. Okay, there's
five different pathways that you could possibly
take in this game, and tonight
we are going to find out which is the next pathway
we decide to take. PROBST:
Rachel, one big word
in what Anika just said. "We."
What is your sense of confidence in knowing who the "we" is,
and that -you are a part of the "we"?
-RACHEL: I mean, I believe that the "we"
that I established today, like, is the "we." You know?
And I-I look around, and I... meet the eyes of the people
that I believe I... I'm working with,
and I feel confident about that. But having cohesion
coming out of this vote is the most important thing. And so tonight is about
solidifying the alliance that I want to be in
come the merge. PROBST:
And Sam, what Rachel says
seems simple. Four people get together
and you vote out one person, and you four are in harmony. But it's not always easy. So is there some fear that maybe we don't come out of this with -everybody in harmony?
-SAM: Yeah. Cohesion is not always
a guarantee, but I feel confident tonight that my "we" is going to be
cohesive after the vote. PROBST:
Anika, how confident are you that are part of the "we"? ANIKA:
It is so silly, but I also think that I'm also hopefully
in the "we," and we'll just have to see. Andy, how confident are you
that you're with the "we"? Yeah, for right now, tonight,
I'm trying to turn the "me" into a "we."
I'm trying to build this vote
to be the one vote where I really feel like I've entered into a group
of people that I can trust. And if I can survive, then, yeah,
now I'm part of a "we." I'm nervous for sure, but I feel like I have a... a shred of hope. And I just want to sort of get to it and, you know,
sort of see my fate. (chuckles) PROBST:
All right. It is time to vote. Rachel, you're up. ♪ ♪ I've been burying you

an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right. I'll read the votes. First vote: Anika. Andy. One vote Anika, one vote Andy. Anika. Two votes Anika, one vote Andy.
One vote left. Fifth person
voted out of Survivor 47: Anika. Need to bring me your torch. You're kidding me, you guys. -Sorry.
-Sorry. Okay. Did you know? I didn't know. Who-who owned this? There's three of us. Three votes. Anika, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Nah. (crying) Grab your torches.
