(cheering, screaming) Oh, my God! Yeah! Hey, hey, hey, let's go! PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... I'm just letting you know. -Thank you for letting me know.
-Yeah. -Thank you for letting me know.
-Yeah. I think I might be a little bit of a mastermind right now,
you know? Rome just talks, talks, talks, and it's crap, crap, crap. Rome is now,
in case anybody wants to know, my number one hit. First opportunity, Rome's outie. SAM:
Everybody here
would be very happy voting Rome tonight. I would love it
if there was a second name. -Yeah.
-Are you guys okay with Andy? If it's Andy, it's Andy. SIERRA:
Yeah. ♪ ♪ First vote: Andy. Sixth person voted out
of Survivor 47: Rome. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ Yes, congrats. -(indistinct chatter)
-(clapping)
-SOL: Yay. TEENY: Right now, I am feeling so, so, so, so good about
what happened at Tribal Council. Rome, my biggest source of paranoia and stress
 in this game, was collectively voted out. And not only
 is the Amulet Advantage out of my hands. It was also played on me so that I didn't even
have a chance of going home. -Congrats. All right?
-Congrats. TEENY:
 But beyond that, Sol is the only known person
who wrote Andy's name down, and he needs to do
 some damage control, because obviously, Andy's gonna
be upset with that. -I did not want to do that.
-Uh-huh. I promise you with all my heart, -I did not want
to do that, okay?
-Uh-huh. Yeah. I genuinely believed
Rome had an idol. -Right.
-I really did. -Okay?
-Yes. -And if he puts my name down...
-Uh-huh. and everyone is on Rome... -Yeah.
-I'm gone. -Okay, so you're very confident
-Yeah. -that he has an idol
and he's gonna play it.
-Right. That means you're very confident
that you're sending me home. Well... Of everyone
on God's green Earth, -Right.
-you chose me. Right. -Why?
-Okay. SOL: Me voting for Andy gives me
some work to do. I knew there was a chance
 that Andy would still be here, but I had to protect myself,
 so now I know I have to
give up some things to earn his trust back, and, um,
I have no problem with that. I didn't want to do it, Andy, but they were all coming
back to me, and were like,
"Hey, Rome wants you." I was like, "Okay, fine,
but we have to have a backup." Okay. Okay. -So that's when I was like...
-Who-who, exactly? It was Sam. Sam is the one who said that you're the backup, okay? ANDY: I did a lot of work to get
 out of Gato alive and have a decently strong alliance
with Sam and Sierra, but I feel like, as time has gone on,
little things have started to not add up in terms of how
 they're moving in this game. And when Sol tells me
 that they are using me as a sacrificial lamb,
 I wasn't shocked. I wasn't that surprised,
 but I was, you know, sort of woken up, and things became
very clear to me. -Based off what
you're telling me,
-Yeah. I need significant help
-Uh-huh. from real allies. -So, I want some protection
from this in the future.
-Mm. -And what I want is an alliance
-Yeah. where people are not
gonna be throwing my name as a backup option. -Do you want
to be a part of that?
-Absolutely. -Um, you...
-The next, like,
three, four moves, you need to make are just...
need to be exactly how I expect. -Okay, man.
-And we get rid of Gata. You got it, man.
My man. ANDY:
 After this vote, I realize if I'm gonna survive the
second half of this game, like, I need to flip the switch. I need to take control
 and have authorship over how the rest
of this game is gonna go for me. And right now, that means
 I should just gun for my Gata tribemates, because if they're gonna come for me, I need to get them first. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ANDY:
 Whatever you need, Sierra. Do you want my Shot in the Dark? I can give you
 my Shot in the Dark. I mean, I would love that. ANDY:
 I'm so thankful for you. -Yeah, man. I got you.
-Let's go. -You know I got you.
-Yeah, I do. It was Sam. Sam is the one who said
 that you're the backup. ANDY:
 Last night really
 got my head spinning because I really feel like
 I invested in those relationships
 with Sam and Sierra on the early days of Gata. But I'm realizing
 that I am a third wheel and ultimately, very expendable. Not even just at the endgame,
 but even now. And so, I'm reevaluating my game coming into this merged tribe. I feel like
 I have an opportunity to find, really,
 sort of my people that I can really roll with
for the long term in this game. And, long story short... ...I want to swing away
from Gata. GENEVIEVE:
 Did you have an okay sleep? ANDY:
I slept okay. Uh, Tribal Council
was interesting, obviously. I know. Oh, my God.
How are you feeling? I really just need to know
how to go forward, like... Last night, my number one
went home, and I'm, like... I'm not taking a second
to mourn it. All I'm thinking is, "Okay, I'm in the market
 for a new ally," and top of my list is Andy. We need to find a way to, like, not just be the singles,
you know, -because the singles,
no one's afraid of.
-Yes. -Yeah, let's do something
about it.
-Yeah. -Like, let's take the game
into our own hands.
-I love that. After the first
immunity challenge, Andy had
what I can only describe as a moment of, like,
true, raw, vulnerable panic. But I really felt
 for him in that moment, and he's still here. I think, probably, because
 people were using him to further their agendas,
 but now he has an agenda and I have an agenda,
 and if we can work together, we can
take back a little bit more power
 at this stage in the game. Okay, so if there's 12 of us,
we need seven. So, if you and I always have, like, open conversations,
we can kind of figure out what's going on
and who's telling what to who. You know what I mean?
Like... I have a vision. I have a vision for how
this game could go for us. -Okay.
-And I like it. Is it good? Is it a good vision? -Yeah, it's a good vision.
-Yeah. It could be, like,
a big sneak attack -in this game.
-Yeah. That'll serve us both so well. -Yeah.
-That would be so good. In order to change my fate, here's what I'm missing
right now: a real number one in this game. I've worked closely
with a few people. I've worked closely with Sam,
 but that's drifting away. And until now, Genevieve is someone
 I didn't know left from right. I didn't really know
 where she stood. I didn't know
 what her game plan was. But I'm kind of
 seeing her, really, as a pretty good
opportunity for me to pick up that one person who
also doesn't have a number one. -I'm excited
for what we could do.
-Yeah. -Oh.
-The possibilities. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Th e fi rs t ti me y ou t ry Bo un ce , it h it s yo u. Your laundry

-So, and then... -She needs her adrenaline high.
-(laughs) SIERRA:
 This morning, we're just getting our Buffs, we're just officially
making it into the merge. And it's, like, there's been
 so much going on at once. Like, we're trying to, like,
 all chill at camp. And then, of course, Genevieve comes about,
and she's like... -I have tree mail.
-(all exclaiming) SIERRA:
 In Survivor, you can't let your guard down,
 and it's, like, actually the most exciting part,
but also terrifying. "A nerve-racking situation, "the vote looming overhead. "Lose your focus
and lose this test, tonight, your game
just might be dead." SUE:
Oh, nice. RACHEL: So at this point,
 I'm, like, really trying to look ahead,
and I'm really trying to see who I'm clicking with. TIYANA:
Got to get out of this blazer
before we friggin'... -I love that you have a blazer.
-Oh, my God. RACHEL:
 Right now, I feel really good
 about the Tuku women. I feel really good about, I mean, most of the women
in this game, honestly. I think that, ideally, I'm going to find six to eight
 of these people that I really feel like
 can work together, and we can start kind of picking off "the other side,"
quote, unquote, you know, whoever that may be. Like, we all... Exactly. -Dude, that'd be... sick.
-SIERRA: Oh, yes. -I would love...
-Oh! And we have the power
to do it, so let's do it. In the Survivor lexicon,
I feel like the all-girls alliance
is almost, like, mythologized at this point. It's been done before. We've seen
 the Black Widow Brigade pull off some of the best moves
 in this show. Since then,
 it gets snubbed before it even gets a chance
to kick off and start. But the way that I would dream
 to play this game is to form an all-women's
alliance and eat all the men. That's, I mean, just
an ideal-case scenario for me. And I really like
 the ladies here, and I think that we could
 all get on the same page. So, who are... who are
some prospects? Like... Oh, my God, I...
Like, me, personally... I'm sorry. Gabe is a threat. TIYANA: There are more women than there are men
in this post-merge sequence. But for me,
 I have to really start to weigh the options
 of if I want to continue to stay
in this Tuku five or if I want
 to completely flip ship and try to form
 genuine connections and a genuine alliance
 on the other side, because I think that this is a perfect
opportunity to get Gabe out. I've been wanting Gabe out
 since the beginning. I feel like
 I cannot trust this man. But no matter what,
 I want people to see me as an individualized player,
 and that I can make my own moves
on my own time, in my own way. ♪ ♪ Come on in! Day 13, the merged tribe of Survivor 47. So, Andy, the last Tribal Council,
you voted out Rome. It wasn't unanimous,
but it was the vast majority. You've got the 12 people that you want
to move forward with -and battle against.
-Yeah. So now how does the game change as we head into
the next challenge? It's just gonna
get a lot tougher. I feel like
we got into the same beach, and one person sort of sunk their own game,
immediately. And that's a really good
consensus-builder. That built this community. -Hmm.
-But, um, now,
it-it just starts. It gets that much
more dangerous. We don't know
who the next target is. We have to play Survivor and see what shakes out tonight. All right. Well, let's get back
into the game, then. -Whew!
-First things first. Kyle, got to take it back. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. -You're holding onto that.
-Yeah. Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
you're gonna need balance, concentration and endurance. Here's how it works. You're gonna stand
 on a narrow beam while balancing a ball
 at the end of a very long pole while holding the pole
 above your head. At regular intervals,
 you're gonna move farther down the beam, making it more difficult
 to balance and concentrate. And the longer
 you're in the challenge, more difficult to keep that pole
 above your head. If at any point you fall off
 or your ball drops, you're out. So, now that you have
the community you want, let's divide that community -and pit you against each other.
-(gasps) PROBST:
Here's how
it's gonna work today. We're gonna randomly divide
into two groups of six. The one person
who lasts the longest for the entire challenge wins, for their group, immunity. -Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Everybody on that team will be safe tonight
at Tribal Council. You will watch Tribal Council
but you won't cast a vote, and you can't have a vote
cast against you. You are safe.
You will see -day 14 of Survivor 47.
-Wow. PROBST:
The person who lasts the longest
for the losing group earns individual immunity,
and you will need it, because that group
is going to Tribal Council, where somebody will be the seventh person voted out
of Survivor 47. And as a penalty
for being voted out, you won't even make the jury. In addition, -you're playing for reward.
-KYLE: All right. -Want to know
what you're playing for?
-(all voice assent) The winning six will go back
to camp and enjoy an afternoon of baby back ribs. -(gasping)
-Oh, my God.
-No! -No.
-PROBST: Potato salad. -Potato salad. Potato salad.
-Yes. -Potato salad.
-Corn on the cob. TIYANA:
No. Shut up. PROBST:
Beer and soft drinks. -Oh, my God.

-Oh, my gosh.
-Always twisting, Jeff. -Always twisting us up.
-All right, take a rock.
Don't look at it. You know I love this part. Which color are you gonna get? Which color do you want? Who else is gonna have
the same color? Who are you gonna
be competing with? Who you gonna
be competing against? Let's see what we have. Everybody, put out your palms... ...and let's reveal. If you are Blue,
come right over here on my left. -Yellow, the far end.
-Okay. (quiet, indistinct chatter) RACHEL:
Feel like we got
some endurance in here today. PROBST:
All right, so let's see how this worked out. We have Genevieve, Sierra, Teeny, Sol, Andy and Sam. Sam, what do you make
about this draw? Yeah, I mean,
it's three Gata, three Lavo, and I think this is now a team of six because if one of us can clutch up for
the other five, we're all safe. So, I'm trying not to think
too much about the dynamics and trying to focus
on how can I make sure that all six of us,
uh, feel good tonight. All right, the other six. We have Rachel, Caroline, Sue, Tiyana, Gabe -and Kyle.
-(laughs)
-Wow. Tell me, Sue.
You've got your hands out. We have our whole Tuku tribe. -Plus me.
-Plus Rachel.
-(laughs) PROBST:
Rachel. On one hand, if you lose, things, on paper,
might not look good. -Yeah. Sure.
-Five versus one. But we're in the merge.
Everybody's wearing purple. Yeah. I mean, there are
other dynamics in play here. And if worse comes to worse, and we're the group going, like, I'll-I'll do everything
I can to stay safe. I am terrified. I look down the line and see the entirety of the Tuku tribe and me. (short chuckle) So, I need to win today or I'm leaving the fate
 of my game in the hands
 of five Tuku members. I cannot believe
that this is happening. Random draws are unpredictable.

-SIERRA: I think...
-Really? SAM: My former Gata members and I get to bond
 with the former Lavo members,
a-and really kind of solidify some trust and common happiness and joy with Sol,
 Teeny and Genevieve. But then, I realized, my Gata girl Rachel's over there
 with the losing group. She's sitting there
 with five Tukus, the entire tribe. She's the odd woman out.
 Like, if things hold to form, she's just getting
picked off tonight and there's nothing
that I can do to save her. The fact that
that Tuku group is... five strong is scary. So, if it is Rachel tonight
and Rachel goes, I would like to see this six -vote together in the next...
-Yeah. -Truly.
-SAM: ...thing. -I know.
-SAM: I think we need to
knock off some of those Tukus, -especially
if there's five of 'em.
-Yeah, we would. -If they stay strong tonight.
-SIERRA: I agree. TEENY: Because there was
 a triple amulet played at the last Tribal Council,
 which acted as a full idol, I think it's possible that there
 could be some sort of idol or advantage hidden, which
would be massively important. And if anyone were to find it,
then it could change everything. I think someone's
gonna find an idol. I think it's gonna
be a crazy Tribal. RACHEL:
 My gut is just on the ground. This is worst-case scenario. There's just nothing you can do
in certain situations if you draw
the wrong-colored rock, and you just get put between
a literal rock and a hard place. You can always hope that
 there's divisions and cracks within original tribes,
 but you can't look at five Tuku members
and one Gata member and not think,
"Well, that's easy." (laughs) Look, guys, I know
it's a pretty... (laughs) ...precarious situation for me. So, if you guys want your time,
I will give it to you, but I'd also appreciate
everybody else's time. SUE:
Of course. Of course. Yup. Rachel was somebody
 who has been perceived as a very big threat
 in this game early on. She's very personable,
she's very charismatic. She's also very smart. So to have her in
 this vulnerable of a position is very advantageous for everybody
in season 47 right now. Yeah. Okay. Oh. The way that rock draw
 at the challenge played out was also perfect for Tuku because it's one more Tribal that all five of us get
to survive. KYLE: Mm-hmm. GABE:
 All these people
 are in this game are tools for me to use, and having
this Tuku majority survive as long as it can
is a very valuable tool. TIYANA: Yeah. The thing is, though, that means when Rachel leaves, they have six now, with three Lavos, three Gatos. They're gonna
 come after one of us. From the outside looking in, Rachel is the obvious vote.
 It's super easy. However, I know with
my whole frigging heart that if we go back to our camp with five strong of Tuku, we are going to be picked off because we don't
have the majority and we totally blew our cover. We technically lied
 to everyone else about how close we were. So, not only are we really,
really strong, but we're liars. What are we supposed
to do with that? This kind of seems
like the perfect opportunity to get Gabe out. -Yeah, it is
a perfect opportunity for it.
-Yeah. KYLE:
Right away, I kind of was like,
 "Rachel, you're doomed. No doubt about it." But then I realized
 it doesn't have to be Rachel. This could be the prime
opportunity to get rid of Gabe. There's a very good chance
that it could stick. You have a better connection
with Rachel than I do. -Do you think
you could pitch it to her?
-Okay. Caroline? KYLE:
 So, we need Rachel
 to be all in on this. We need her to not play
 that Shot in the Dark because we're about to make
something awesome happen. I'm gonna be, like, totally
straight-up and honest with you. I want to work with you,
and I know that, like, you are also close
with, like, Sierra, and, like, you make good connections because I feel like
you're a genuine person. I feel really good
about you ladies. -Mm-hmm.
-Like, so good. So... my game plan that I just brought up to Kyle-- um, I'm gonna pretend
like it's five strong. But I've been itching for
an opportunity to get Gabe out. RACHEL:
 Okay. I mean, I love to hear it.
I wasn't sure because, -you know, like, it's hard
to read the dynamics.
-E-Exactly. And, like, you do a good job
of, like, you know, -seeming very tight, so...
-No. RACHEL:
Tiyana comes up to me and says, "I actually want
to get Gabe out." I mean, that's music
 to my ears, obviously. I'm gonna vote for whoever that's not me to get me out
of this very sticky situation. The thing is, it all comes down
to, I think, Caroline. But I know she's a smart girl. She knows, moving forward,
if we go back with five, we are -completely screwed.
Like, there's no...
-Yeah, I get it. Everyone is gonna
gang up on you. -Everyone is gonna
gang up on us.
-Yeah. And honestly, what better way
to prove that we have cracks -than to vote out Gabe?
-Yeah. What Tiyana's saying
 is completely true. Tuku is already a very
threatening presence as it is. And to go back
and show that they are united in voting out someone
who, you know, is pretty much on "the bottom," as far as anybody can tell-- I was left out
 on the Anika vote and now I'm the freaking
 underdog here-- like, that's not a good look for them. And so, Tiyana has, like,
a very good point that taking out someone like Gabe
 would be really smart. So, if Tiyana can
 swing Caroline and Kyle wants to also go along
 with this Gabe plan, like, I'm in. I' m a li fe lo ng R ep ub li ca n an d I vo te d fo r Tr um p tw ic e, but I can't do it again. Trump wants a national

I don't normally like ribs,
but those are amazing. TEENY:
So psyched we won that. SIERRA:
I'm full. I don't
even want to say it. (Andy groans) This has been a very interesting
 and weird season in terms of advantages. They've all
shown themselves early. A lot of advantages
have come out and kind of just been flushed
sort of preemptively, or in weird situations, like
at last night's Tribal Council. And when those leave the game, new ones come to replace them,
typically, and so, finding an advantage could be a very, very,
 very beneficial thing for me. SIERRA:
 Andy has just been somebody we've been keeping around
 because we needed his vote on Gata, so I am not surprised that Andy is searching
 for an advantage. And he's a sloppy player,
 plain and simple. He's just all over.
You can't, like, track him. And I'm like, that's just
not somebody I can work with. GENEVIEVE:
Now that I'm working with Andy, I cannot stress enough
 how important it is for him to be careful. I honestly feel like if you go
looking for an advantage this early into merge, you have to be sure
 that you can find it. Oh! I'm at this amazing reward. I'm loving everything about life
in this moment. We're all just kind of chilling,
 you know, getting our, uh, food comas on, taking naps, and, uh, I'm just not tired, and I'm like, "Hey, sometimes
 there's something on these, uh, rewards,
some type of advantage." And so, I start creeping around,
 you know, taking a look, and I'm making sure everyone's
 got their eyes closed. So, I feel like
 I have free rein to go searching for an idol. I'm, like, looking, you know, around the plates

-Bones. -You guys did it!
-Well done. Look at that. Okay.
We talk out loud. This is not...
I'm not saying that I'm -going to do it.
-Let's purely brainstorm. Yes. Purely brainstorm. You would never think
of actually getting Gabe out, would you? Are you debating? Let's... I want to hear your... 'Cause, like, the whole thing
is that this is an alliance -where we talk things through.
-Right. Exactly. -Yes.
-Like, I just know, keeping the five strong
would be awesome. -Mm-hmm.
-But we can't. -If we come back with five...
-Mm-hmm. -we are screwed.
-Yeah. Tiyana mentioned, you know, going after Gabe is an option, and it's something
we should debate. And there is a fear that if we successfully
 vote out Rachel, five Tuku strong, we get picked off
one after one after one. I think you're right in that they're gonna
come after us -Yeah.
-when we're five. Here's the thing.
I think they will go after us, but they're not going after us. They're gonna go after Kyle
 if he doesn't get the necklace.
 And if he does -get the necklace, it's Gabe.
 -TIYANA: Yeah. Here's another thought.
I personally think Rachel is the most dangerous player
 in this game, and I actually think
 it's much easier for us to get numbers with girls
 with Rachel out, because Rachel's the one
who's connecting everyone. -Mm.
-Rachel is the best I've seen in a long time. I personally think Rachel
is the glue of the Gata tribe, and if we get rid of her, a lot of options open up
for Tiyana and I. Once Rachel's gone, it's easier for us to be in the mix. Mm. If it was anyone but Rachel,
I'd be down. I agree with you. Ah, that's so ...
for Rachel, man. I like her, too.
That's the issue. Guess what? Out of all of them,
I liked her the best. -I do like her the best.
-Mm-hmm. -She's that good.
-Right. Caroline does bite just a little bit, but she does have
some reservations. And since Caroline
 is not on board, it really
 is disappointing, because I wish, wish, wish that there was a way to get Gabe out of the game. GABE:
I think tonight can be -one of two things, right?
-Yeah. We can go Tuku strong,
five deep. But, like, what problems
does that create -when we get back home?
-Yeah, definitely. And I think it creates
a lot of big problems -when we get back home.
-A lot of big problems. Or we can get somebody
we've been wanting to get out for a bit now out of the game. Everybody on Tuku seems
 to be on the same page: it's Rachel tonight. The dilemma is
how can we get her to not play
her Shot in the Dark? Because if she plays
 her Shot in the Dark and it hits, then we got
 to cannibalize each other, and we don't want to do that. Oh, ... GABE:
 We can go back, and we don't have
 this Tuku majority -target on our back anymore.
-Right. And that's the thing
that I'm most scared of. Y-You know, I'm no dummy. If we were to take
all five of us back, I'm not the last person
on the list -that people want to get out.
-Yeah. Yeah. -I'm gonna be high
on that list.
-Yeah. Gabe's plan--
 because he is also so adamant that if they go back
as a strong five, that he'll be next or
he'll be the one after next-- he wants Caroline out. I want to believe it,
 but all the BS that I've bought along the way
 in this game-- it's felt so good,
it's felt so right. In that moment, it made sense,
and yet it was all fake. If nothing else, you, me, Kyle could throw a three on Caroline, and in our worst-case scenario,
we're going to a tie. But then what happens? I mean, I would go to rocks -over that, because...
-Genuinely? Well, I mean, what the ... am
I supposed to do at that point? -Yeah.
-Because then it's like,
"Hey, Caroline, like, -I put your name down."
-Yeah. And then,
"Oh, okay. Hey, I'm sorry." -Yeah, valid, valid.
-Like, I-I'll backtrack, -and, you know like,
"Okay, let's just do Rachel."
-Yeah. -So, it's, like... You know?
-Oh, my God, Gabe. I mean, you're giving me
so much hope here. It's, like, the best thing
 I could have ever hoped for and it sounds so implausible
at the same time. Either Tuku
 is completely playing me or maybe I have
some kind of hope in this game, and I'm still figuring out
which-which one it is. -Well, thank you.
-So... Yeah, of course. -Can I hug you?
-Of course. -Yeah, of course. Of course.
-Oh, my God. This is by far
 the most precarious place I've been in this game, because at least
in the other situations, I wasn't actually the person
on the chopping block. If I screw up tonight,
 I will not be on the jury, I will not
be in this game anymore. And I... That's... terrifying. TEENY: No foul balls over here. (laughs) -Oh!
-(clapping) -Oh!
-Oh!
-Change up. Change up. SOL:
 I found my first advantage
 in this game. I was cool, calm,
 and I found it. And so, I'm pretty sure
no one else saw it. In fact, I know
nobody else saw it. Otherwise, they would have
 said something. Home run! SOL:
 So now, I'm gonna have to put on
 my Oscar-winning performance and go off all by myself, because in this game,
 secrets are very, very rare. But for me,
 I'm keeping it to myself. So right now, no one else knows in this game
what I'm about to pull. Come on, come on. What is it? What is it? What is it? -Oh.
-(whooping, clapping,
chatter in distance) Oh. (laughs) I got a lot of power right now. I finally get to use an advantage
in this game and change the outcome
of some things. Oh, my God.
That's gonna be so great. What this advantage does
is it gives someone the opportunity
to block a vote. Which is simply, if someone
 writes a vote, you can say, "Nope, that's not gonna count." Or they can have
Safety without Power. So, in the middle
of Tribal Council, they can literally just
leave Tribal Council, go back to camp,

It's close to sundown. CAROLINE:
I think we're leaving soon. I want to go
to Tribal right now. -Like, right now. I can't.
-SUE: I can't think of that now. Like, I'm...
Like, my entire body is just... -I just want
to get it over with.
-Yeah. SOL:
 This is a big decision, and I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do yet. I could give it to Rachel,
 but I'm not sure if that's actually good
 for my game. And if I don't give it
 to Rachel, then I could build
 incredible bonds with someone on the Tuku tribe and have another option
 to get to the end. Ultimately, what it's gonna come down to
is what's gonna help my game. I want to help somebody else, but this decision is based
 on what's best for me. My heart is beating

So, last Tribal Council, we had everybody-- 13 people. Now we're back down
to small numbers. Six people chosen randomly,
and we had the most lopsided draw
we could have with five Tuku-- the most people left
in the game from one tribe-- and Rachel.
On top of it, you have to make this decision
in front of six people who can just watch
because they're not in trouble. They don't vote.
But, man, they can observe. All right, so let's
look at the obvious. If there was
no emotion or gameplay and it was just numbers, this would be easy:
take out Rachel. But any time you hear the word
"easy" on Survivor, you should be terrified,
because Survivor is never easy. Caroline, five Tuku. Maybe this is a time
to make a move. Maybe you don't want
to be part of all five Tuku. Here's an opportunity, because
you have Rachel as a vote. Oh, I can guarantee you that was
running through people's minds. We have to realize
numbers are numbers, and it's gonna look threatening. But it sucks, 'cause I see
pros and cons both ways, and it's hard to figure out which one is gonna
hurt my game less. PROBST:
Gabe, one of the premises
of Survivor is numbers.
You got to have the numbers. But if you have
too many numbers, then you got to get rid
of some of the numbers because too many
looks threatening. GABE:
I look around and I see the five people that I've been with
for 13 days so far. And I know, on the surface,
it looks simple, but any of those
five people might say, "Tonight's a hell of a night
to make one of those moves." PROBST:
So, Rachel, the minute
the challenge ended and you had lost and you knew
you were coming here, you could not
have predicted to hear, "Oh, Rachel's not a for-sure. There are opportunities
all over the place." RACHEL:
I mean, yeah. This rock draw, nobody can deny
that this is, like, the worst-case scenario. Um, but I don't know if Gabe is blowing smoke
up my ass right now. If you're actually a tight five, and you're trying
to stay together, the plan would be to convince me
that you have cracks, and to get me not
to play my Shot in the Dark. So, it's scary. It's not been
an easy day for me. PROBST:
Kyle, once again, you have individual immunity,
and it does give you just a little bit of breath that you can stand back and say,
"I'm noticing some things." What'd you see? Yeah, so,
Rachel did a good job today. I mean, she took time
to pull everybody aside. She talked in groups, she went on solo adventures
with people. She did her job,
trying to find cracks, and may have found some, and...
and she did her little wiggle. PROBST:
Tiyana, I find it fascinating
that you have five Tuku members, all maybe
independently thinking, "How could I use Rachel?" You really just put
our pickle on blast, Jeff. That's exactly what I've been
thinking all day long because this is a very important vote.
Like, being able to make the jury,
for me, personally, it just means
the absolute world, and I know it means the world
to everybody here. So, I got to go with my gut, and honestly,
with the vote tonight, I'm just hoping that
I send a message to the people that
I really trust that I can be worked with
and I'm someone that can be trusted in an alliance. PROBST:
Caroline, tell me more about the importance
of making the jury. I think
the universal feeling that I want to say almost every
single Survivor player has who actually cares
about the game-- you want to have an impact
on the game. It's not that we're sitting here
dreaming of being on the jury, but we're dreaming
of having an absolute, tangible, irrefutable piece of evidence that we made an impact
on this game. PROBST:
All right. So, Rachel,
for you, this afternoon, the subject line is easy. "Vote, vote, vote. I'm a vote." But you're not just a vote. You want this vote
to have some impact tomorrow. RACHEL:
Well, I think sometimes in Survivor, you can plan three steps ahead and sometimes you just
have to get through the night. And today was one of those days where I just had
to get through the night. And so, today was anybody else that
I can possibly, like, hope that these people want
to vote out that isn't me. PROBST:
When you went
from person to person, was your hope meter undulating? Oh, it undulated.
There was some chaos. There was some paranoia.
There were stories that were not
cross-checking, and this has been the hardest day
of Survivor for me. PROBST:
So, Sue, given
where we are in the game, and all the uncertainty,
maybe the five Tuku, for tonight, take out Rachel.
That's the easy move. "And we all make the jury
and we'll figure it out." Yeah, that is the easiest move, and it's almost like
the most obvious move. But, you know,
I learned real quick, this game basically changes
almost on the hour. You can't predict anything. You can say, "Okay,
I'm set in stone this way." Next thing you know,
you're totally flip-flopped. So it's just, like,
my head is spinning. It's really, really... This is
very difficult for me tonight. PROBST:
Tiyana, part of playing Survivor is making a move, but also, maybe
to not make a move. Is that part of the discussion
that Tuku was having? "We could just vote out Rachel"? Oh, absolutely,
That was always an option. I mean, just look
at five versus one. It kind of seems like
the obvious option, but you want to make big moves because if I just go for it
and I swing for the fences and it doesn't work out,
at least I know I went for it. What happens if tomorrow,
I didn't take that chance and I go home with regrets? That is, like,
my biggest nightmare from this entire experience
is going home with any regrets. This is your shot.
This is your opportunity. You got to go for it
or you're gonna miss it. PROBST:
Caroline, the risk is the Tuku five blow it tonight. You had five.
This was easy. And you make a move
and it was a little too soon. I think you're hitting
the nail on the head. In the new era, there's such
an emphasis on big moves, and granted,
big moves win you the game, but it's big, smart moves. There's a very big distinction
between a big move that changes things in a way that's
not good for you, in a way that
blows up your game. And that's what
I'm playing my game on, is what are the smart moves
that I can make? Sometimes they're not
always flashy, but I'm making the moves
that are best for my game and for my alliance. PROBST:
So, Rachel, it all centers around you. The Tuku five are in charge. The question is
can you find a way to get at least one or two
of them to come with you and try to make a move?
What's the feeling? Is it optimistic,
pessimistic or hopeful? You know, um, still anxious,
but anxiously hopeful. I think that I know
what the plan is tonight, and I think that
I'm a part of that plan, and I have given my word
that I'm gonna do something and I intend to do it and I just really hope that no one's giving me a shakedown. PROBST:
Gabe, concerning at all
that Rachel's saying, "Hey, man, I was told there's
a plan and I'm a part of it and if it works,
I'm gonna be here tonight"? Well, I mean, it's concerning if you don't know
what that plan is. And depending on what
perspective you look at it on, Rachel could be
totally helpless, drowning in the water,
hoping somebody grabs her hand. But if she can sow enough
discord between all of us, all of a sudden,
Rachel might be sitting on top of the mountain saying, "I'm choosing
who's going home tonight." And that's a pretty crazy thing
to think about when you really
dig deep into it. So, as we get ready
for the vote, it seems like it is
a very simple question. "Will the Tuku five
stick together or are the Tuku five going
to turn on each other?" All right, it is time to vote. -Sue.
-Jeff? Um, about 20 minutes--
and I mean 20 minutes-- before we left for Tribal, I found a scroll in my bag.
And when I ran into the woods to read it, I discovered that somebody sent me... an advantage... only good for tonight. PROBST:
Rachel, read
your advantage for me. Sorry.
My hands are shaking. (short chuckle) "When Jeff says
it's time to vote, announce that you have the
Safety without Power Advantage." "You will leave
Tribal Council immediately. "You will not cast a vote but more importantly,
you cannot be voted out." So, I hope that
you all understand. My husband gave me
a couple words of wisdom before I came out here
and one of them was, "Do not go home with
something in your pocket." So, assuming I was
getting strays tonight, this is a lifeline, and
thank you to whoever sent it. PROBST:
All right. So, Rachel's playing the Safety without Power.

is fascinating. I mean, what Gabe just said-- "It's as if we did a time warp. We're back to the Tuku tribe." So, where's your heart
right now? Oh, it's pounding through
the back of my... my body. (chuckling):
I-I don't really know. I mean, yes, of course
I'm safe, so, great. But this vote,
whatever happens right now, is going to propel
into the future. It's gonna have
repercussions, right? And that could break
my game apart, like, quick. PROBST:
Tiyana, you are looking up to the sky, you're looking
for answers from somewhere. What is the game now? Um... Damn. This is ...
I'm not gonna lie to you. Spending 13 days
with people is not something that I take for granted,
and it just is, like... I don't know. My anxiety is,
like, really through the roof and it's hard to think and process words and... I even just told you that
the jury means everything. Like, getting there
means everything. So... I don't know. It's gonna suck. PROBST:
Is the emotion more
that you're worried you will be voted out tonight or is the emotion that
you're not sure what to do because this wasn't the plan? Both. Like, it's very, very possible
that it could be me, and that would just,
like, devastate me, and that would
be horrible, and... Damn. But at the same time,
I have a pit in my stomach that I got to
send somebody home that... I know really,
really wants to be here. So it's almost like
I'm crying for both myself and others, and it...
I've never done this before. I've never
cried for myself and others. It doesn't even make sense
because it's literally the exact same situation. PROBST:
I got to say, from here,
it makes total sense. You're terrified
it could be you and if it's not you,
you're horrified by the thought -that you have
to do it to somebody else.
-Ugh. My family's gonna kill me
that I'm crying. Damn. Awesome.
While I'm crying, everyone's talking.
Okay, cool. I'm just gonna get up now. I was, like, "Time for frigging debates
to happen over here." -KYLE: So, we're back on?
-I... Okay. Okay. Okay. PROBST:
So, Caroline, what's
in your head right now? I'll be honest.
I don't even know how to answer your question.
My brain is not equipped to handle this at this moment.
It's not. So it's-it's just
overwhelmed right now? Yeah. How about you, Gabe? We all have relationships. Survivor is a game
of relationships, and you got to trust 'em. So tonight,
I'm trusting my relationships, and we'll see if that trust pays off
in a few minutes, I'm sure. All right, it is time to vote. Sue, you're up. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. ♪ ♪ If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Gabe. Tiyana. One vote Gabe,
one vote Tiyana. Tiyana. That's two votes
Tiyana, one vote Gabe. PROBST: Seventh person
voted out of Survivor 47: Tiyana.
That's three. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. (scoffs) (sniffles) Oh... Tiyana, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. (crying) No. No. No, no. (crying continues) Grab your torches,
head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by
