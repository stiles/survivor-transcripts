 I think I am dangerous

 Growing up,
 life was a struggle, man. I spent five years in foster care,
over 26 different homes I lived in before
 I would graduate high school. I could have just flipped over

-(clapping) You're here. -Oh, my God.
-Oh, my gosh. TK: I would say, looking
 at my fellow contestants, uh, I see a million dollars, man.
Like, I really don't think
 I see anybody on here who can do anything with me,
 to be honest. So, I'm ready to go. All right.
Welcome to Survivor 47. (whooping) -It's crazy.
-PROBST: So, every season of Survivor starts the same way, with the forming
of a new community. That's what's happening
right now. Take a look around. This is gonna be your community for the next 26 days. And the reason community has always been the foundation of this social experiment
we've been doing for 24 years is because humans
have always craved community. And I get it. If you're at home
watching Survivor, you could say
"Ah, it doesn't fully jibe. "I mean, they're not
really abandoned. You're not really on your own."
That's true. There are cameras
shooting you right now. But what you all
are going to experience because you're here is that when you're tired
and you're hungry or you feel left out,
it's gonna feel very real because you're gonna
have those same cravings for community. And what truly
sets Survivor apart from any other social experiment
like this is the game
that sits on top of it, a game that's
played with humans. The same humans you are
forming your community with are your adversaries. So you have to build a community with people you can rely on
while you vote them out and then
after you vote them out, you go back to them
and try to persuade them to give you the vote
for the million dollars. How do you pull off
that magic trick? So let's see if we can solidify
your community a little bit by giving you an identity
with a tribe name. We'll start with Blue.
Blue, you are Tuku. -Tuku!
(cheering, whooping) In the middle, Red, Lavo. -Lavo!
-(cheering)
-Yes. And on the end, Gata. -Gata!
-Gata.
-(cheering) PROBST:
All right,
so let's see if we can get a little personality
from our tribes. Guy in the front, in the middle,
what's your name? My name is Gabe,
from Baltimore City. What do you bring
to your community back home? I mean, when it comes to
working, I'm a grinder, man. I try to lead by example,
and I try to be the guy that says, "I'm just
as tired as you are, but "if I got energy to keep going,
I know for sure that you got energy
to keep going." In the front, in the middle,
introduce yourself. Uh, my name is Teeny.
I know it looks like I'm from the Wild Wild West
right now, but I'm actually
a proud New Jerseyan. I feel like this is, like,
aggressively scarecrow, and, uh, that's not really
New Jersey's vibe, but, you know, I like to change it up
with, like, my style. Just to be clear, it's not like I gave you these pants. -These are your...
-No, I... I... It's my style. It's my style.
I own it. I'm just saying:
New Jersey proud. (laughing) PROBST:
Guy in the corner. -What's your name?
-Hi. I'm Andy. Andy, talk to us
about your role back home. What's your life about? Growing up,
I had, like, four friends. So unpopular because
I did not have an identity, and I kept trying
different things. I would wear
Grateful Dead T-shirts to be... pretend I was a stoner. I'm afraid of weed. -I can't smoke weed.
I can't do that.
-(laughing) I was a poser, right?
But I learned that I just have to be myself, and it's become a super magnet for everyone in my life
that I have today. -PROBST: Guy on the end.
-Yeah. -Introduce yourself.
-I'm Jon. I'm a podcast host, and I really care
what people think of me. (laughing) So much.
Four friends in high school? Must be nice. (laughing) PROBST:
Well, Jon, it's always so exciting to start
a new season of Survivor. So, what's the energy right now? You know,
I'm here in part because every episode you say,
"Apply to be on Survivor." And you have this idea of what you would play like or what you could play like. And I think
we're all nervous because what we would play like
or could play like is about to be fact-checked
against what we will play like. -PROBST: Wow.
-And if you're cocky,
that's exciting. (laughing) And if you're not, it's not. (laughing) Well, shall we get
to the next phase? -(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: All right. Your first test as new tribes is waiting for you
in the jungle. -AYSHA: Oh, my God.
-Follow me. AYSHA:
Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. ANDY: Jeff walks us down the beach, turns a corner
 and takes us to... It could only be described as, like, a gladiator's arena. Look, I've seen a lot
 of Survivor. There are opening challenges, but this one
 really takes the cake in terms of the grandness. And the pressure is on.
 Like, you have to perform or you're gonna
be in trouble immediately. All right. Let's get to your
first challenge as new tribes. Here's how it works. Two players from each tribe are gonna crawl
 under a muddy net. You're gonna race
 into the jungle... ...and retrieve
 two puzzle pieces from one of three
 different obstacles. Then you race back,
 the next pair goes. Once you have all six pieces, two tribe members
 will use those pieces to solve a rectangular puzzle. The first tribe to finish earns their camp supplies. You know the drill. It's not much--
a pot, a machete and a flint-- but out here, it's everything, and will provide
a massive head start. The two losing tribes will have
to try to earn it another way. -Make sense? All right,
-Yup. give everybody a minute
to strategize, we'll get started. -All right.
-SUE: Let's go. Here we go. First challenge of Survivor 47. Survivors ready? (cheering) -Go! You're going out in pairs.
-(cheering) Get through that mud. Come on, guys! SIERRA:
Come on, Gata! That mud is birthing you
into Survivor right there. SUE:
Let's go! Yeah! (whoops)
Go, Caroline, go! PROBST:
There goes Kyle
in the lead for Tuku. Camp supplies on the line. Biggest head start
you can get in this game is the pot, the machete
and the flint. (cheering) -Let's go!
-(whooping) All right, here we go.
Let's go. -I'm on left.
-Okay, go. PROBST:
Working together
to free up these puzzle pieces. Got to get
all that rope through. -They're all spooled up.
-All right. Watch that one. -O-Over.
-Watch out. PROBST:
Once your pieces
are free, you can head back. These pieces are heavy. Sam heading back
with the first piece for Gata. SIERRA:
Come on, Gata! -(whooping)
-Let's go, Sam! -(overlapping shouting)
-I see you! Come on! Aysha has her piece.
Kishan has his. SAM:
Come on. PROBST: Sam's back to help. -Okay. Ready?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-PROBST: Kyle and Caroline still -working for Tuku.
-KYLE: Okay. How do you feel about it? KYLE: Keep going. SOL:
There we go. There we go. That's how you do it
on Survivor, right there! -(cheering)
-Let's go! Got to get back with both
pieces. Keep going, Aysha. You're good, Lavo. Head out.
It's Teeny and Genevieve. SUE:
Guys, get ready. -Go!
-You're good, Gata! Head out! Rachel and Jon. Go, Jon! Go, Rachel! PROBST:
You're good, Tuku. Head out. It's Gabe and Sue. CAROLINE:
Yes! Make it up. PROBST: Jon whipping that rope. Wow!
-This way, this way. -Okay.
-PROBST: Teeny and Genevieve
doing a nice job working together. Threading that rope through. Sue has hers, Gabe has his. -Tuku, you can head back.
-TEENY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Sue! Lok at that. PROBST:
Gabe heading back with a piece. Sue heading back with a piece. -Go, go, go.
-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Go! TK:
There we go, let's go! Let's go, Tuku! Get 'em back to the tower. You're good, Tuku. Head out. -Tiyana and TK. Whoa.
-Whoa! TK whipping through the mud. (overlapping shouting) You're good, Gata. Go! Sierra and Andy. PROBST:
Lavo, you got to keep moving. You're good. Head out. Sol and Rome. The last two. TK heads back to his team. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:
Sol heading back with
a puzzle piece for Lavo. Lavo's closing the gap
right now. Rome is free.
It's now Gata in dead last. Andy and Sierra-- they have
blown the little lead they had. Tuku with their final
puzzle piece. You're good, Tuku.
Start solving the puzzle. It's probably the, um...
Let's try it. PROBST:
It is Caroline and Kyle
for Tuku. That's gonna be an end piece? Solving a rectangular puzzle. Have to just put in... -All right, let's go.
-Lavo, you're good. -Start working on the puzzle.
-Oh. -Go, Gata!
-Come on, Gata! PROBST:
Here comes Andy.
He's got one piece. Gata still has one piece left. -Can you catch it?
-PROBST: Gata's dead
last right now. (grunting) Now you're good, Gata.
Start working. Rachel and Anika trying to make up
a lot of time for Gata, who are working together to solve a complicated Survivor puzzle, with tribe supplies on the line. We scoot it once.
That could go... here. PROBST:
There is no second place today, just two losers. -Yeah.
-Yes, and then that one there.
-PROBST: Gata now has new momentum. Anika and Rachel
feeling excited now that maybe
they have something sorted. -Yes, guys!
-Yep. -Yes!
-This one right here. -This one right here.
-Gata with a lot
of enthusiasm right now. Guys, guys, don't worry,
don't worry, don't worry. -Let's go!
-PROBST: Is this it? Have they solved it? -Yes, go!
-They got here last. Can they finish first? -Push it in there! Yeah!
-Put that in there! PROBST:
Put the top on. -Oh, my God.
-You got to get up. Why you never give up
in this game, ever. -Let's go! Let's go!
-Let's go! PROBST:
They got to get the top on. And they've got it!
Get to the top! -(whooping)
-PROBST: It's over! Gata wins tribe supplies. -That's it.
-(whooping) PROBST:
A lot of effort from Gata
to stay in this. -That was hard. That's no joke.
-No, that was tough. -GENEVIEVE: Good try.
-PROBST: Wow. None of us could get it. One, two, three. GATA:
Gata! All right.
Gata, congratulations. -(whooping)
-Tribe supplies are yours.
It's not much. A pot, a machete and a flint. But out here, it is everything. Come grab it.
Along with a map to your home. Gata, grab your stuff, head out.
You get the big advantage of starting work on your camp. SAM:
Thank you, Jeff. -Good job, guys. Good job.
-Thank you. -Killer. You were a killer.
-Oh, thank you. PROBST:
All right, Tuku, Lavo, no tribe supplies for you. You're gonna have
to try to earn them another way. Here's how it's gonna work. Each tribe's gonna choose
one person to take on this task. You're not gonna get any information
about what is required, so you're making a blind choice. How about rock, scissors,
odd man out goes? -Do you want to go?
-No. All right, who's it gonna be? All right,
Aysha's going for Lava. Tuku, how about you?
Make a decision? There's three people
that want to go, so that's why
we're gonna either throw a rock or scissors,
and then the odd man out goes. I love this! -Yeah.
-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors. -Geez.
-Not you throwing paper,
and we said rock first. Is that what you said? (laughing) TIYANA:
But, yeah, you're odd man out. Decision has been made. We have Aysha for Lavo,
TK for Tuku. You two are heading
out together. Head down.
Boat'll pick you up. Good luck. All right, Tuku,
map to your new home. -Thank you.
-Lavo, map to your home.
-Hey, yeah, baby. -Yeah!
-Grab your stuff, head out. -Good luck.
-Thank you. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Thank you, Jeff. ROME: Aysha chose
 to go on this journey, which-- props to you,
but big mistake. The social game
 is the biggest aspect of the game of Survivor, and I am not gonna miss out on those first few hours
of strategizing. It's so important.
 That's exactly how I'm gonna win the million

We don't really know each other,
 but this is a tribe that can win challenges
because we did. I live in Los Angeles. No, I started in WeHo,
where all the gays go. I was a speechwriter
for a while. -Okay.

-ANIKA: Most important thing: -shelter?
-Yeah.
-Yeah. JON:
 And now, all these
 years later, I'm here. I feel a little bit like
the dog that caught the car. -So, something with a...
-A piece of bamboo across, like, that? -And then one over there.
-Yeah, something
with, like, a crotch. I am a numbers guy
 and that's how I want to play this game. Because I look at Survivor as ultimately, a numbers game. -Good? All right.
-Yup. ANDY:
 There are only six
 people on the tribe, but that constitutes
 15 one-on-one relationships. You could do the math.
 It's a pretty simple equation. It's a combination. Six, choose two, factorial equals 15. So if I connect with two people, it would actually be very hard
 to get voted out. ANDY: Because if I could
 count on two people to not write my name down, it would be very difficult
for four people to write my name down. Who has to come out
to their own girlfriend? And I'm like, "Okay."
And they're great vibes. But I'm just saying,
I just think, you know, we just have that... -We don't need to try.
-I love it. -I love it.
-You know what I mean?
-Unspoken. -Guys, like, unspoken.
-All right. (laughing) (laughing) SUE: I like your idea
of getting a shelter started. Let's do it. -The more we have,
the more comfortable we'll be.
-Yeah. TIYANA:
Not winning that challenge today actually sunk me to my core. Fingers crossed
 that TK comes through and brings back something good
for this tribe, because we're gonna
need it tonight. What type of vibe
are we going for here? Looking around at my tribe,
 I feel like we stack up incredibly well
in terms of physical strength. SUE:
You guys rock. This is crazy. (laughs) TIYANA:
 But puzzle-wise, we have some work to do. Tie? Uh, I mean,
at least for right now. If we find more,
we can always reinforce it. Coming into this game, I want
 to work with an older person. I want to work with somebody who's a little more mature
 because I got a bit of an old soul
in me, right? SUE: Uh-huh. What?! In my opinion, an older person-- they know how to operate
 without getting caught up in the social games of it all. That's somebody
who I want my day one, number one
alliance member to be. People are gonna be running
around with their heads cut off. People are gonna
be whispering at Tribal. When that happens... Thank you. Ditto. GABE:

-Grandson. -Yeah.
-Aiden. How old is he? He's four. I love Caroline.
 She is literally the sweetest person

my mom's and I thing. Now, see, it's me and Chelsea's.
Same thing, so you get it. She's so excited,
 and that's like my daughter, so, it's cool.
Like, there's something there. Yeah. Uh, what do you mean? You're the main person
that I feel, like, -I've got, like...
-Oh, good. -Oh, no, no, no. Exact opposite.
-Okay. At my age, I thought for sure I would be the very bottom. But now I feel
 like Caroline and Gabe-- they're-they're my number ones, and so I'm feeling good with it.
 Now we're gonna be a force
to be reckoned with. KISHAN:
 All right. We're just
 organizing them from, like, -Biggest to smallest.
-biggest to smallest so that it's, like, a nice incline. -I think this one over here...
-This one's got some girth. Yeah.
So, let's move this one. -Yep. -KISHAN: Losing that
 first challenge-- it sucks.
 We're not the tallest tribe. We didn't look to be
 the strongest, but Lava-- we're-we're resourceful. We just have to trust
our instincts and kind of fall back onto our training
and our, like, gut. So, that's what we're doing. Yeah! Like... KISHAN:
 I'm an emergency room doctor. I love the chaos. TEENY:
I think it's a dead hermit crab. We could eat it. Oh... Doctor. KISHAN:
 You're just
 constantly surrounded by the unknown, and I'm so ready for that,
'cause that's what I do every single day for a living,
and I'm really good at it, and I'm gonna be good at it
on Survivor, too. TEENY:

 Playing Survivor is about the social relationships
you make. In school, the one thing
 that I really excelled at was being able to make friends
 and talk to people. And so I'm gonna
 play this game by being every single person's
 number one. (laughing): Exac... Keyshawn and I bonded
 almost immediately. So, I mean, he's an ER doctor. He has an ability
 to work under pressure. And I feel like he's a bit more
introverted to my extrovert, so I felt like he was
a cool yin to my yang. I think she's
got the perfect vibe. -Yes.
-I think it's gonna be great. Us three stick together,
we're good to go. GENEVIEVE:
 The new era of Survivor is a very fast-paced game, and right now,

Oh, my gosh. GENEVIEVE:
 I'm also trying to solidify
 something with Teeny. I would love
to have her as my ally. (gasps) Me too. Me too. I really like Genevieve. I want to play this game
 with her. But let's remember we have
an entire tribe member coming back here. (whoops)
My goodness. -So, TK.
-How you feeling? -Aysha.
-Nice to introduce me, -nice to meet... For sure.
-Yes. -This is wild.
-We have... Oh, my gosh. -Okay.
-You want to break it down? When I read that
 one person was going to get their camp supplies
 and the other was gonna go back to camp empty-handed,
my stomach dropped. This man looks like he currently is in the NFL. -So, on three?
-All right. Yes. -One, two, three.
-One, two, three. Whoa. Here we go. Okay. What am I looking for? So, when I uncovered the clue and saw that it was a picture,
 I realized this is my guide. I have to match the two to find the key.
 It's gonna look identical. Okay. Agua. I look at this map.
 I see the first X, and it's this huge rock face
 that is near. So I'm thinking,
"Just look for a big rock face. I'll find the X." I look around-- there's, like,
eight rock faces. So, everything looks
exactly the same. This is this rock. It's saying "between two rocks." Ah, there it is.
That's what I'm looking for. That's it. (quietly): Yes! So, when I got my first key,
 that gives me the clue to be able
 to find that second key. A mountain of rocks. Okay.
This a mountain of rocks? Oh. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's... I get that first key
 and I'm hyped. Now I got my confidence.
Now I know I can do it. Come on, T, come on, T. (grunts) Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Yes! This is it. Perfect. I found my second key
 and I feel like I'm cooking, we're going, I have it. Okay. (sighs): Okay.
Come on, bro. It has to be over here. Let's see if it's right here. Here it is. I never would have thought that the final key was in the ocean. This is it.
 Whoever finds the fourth key wins. See, thi-this is the tree. Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, that's two keys.
 I'm hyping myself up like, "They don't
 know who they messing with." All right.
Three trees by theirselves. Come on, T. I don't even know
how to get back down. I don't even remember
where the path was. How am I--
I'm lost. I'm lost. Let's go. Let's go.
Now I'm getting my rhythm. Give me my money. Uh-oh.
Hold up. In the ... ocean is insane. Well, got to go back down, then. (grunts) Oh, my God, dude,
where is the exit? The forest is so dense. And I'm like, "You know what, "forget that path.
Make your own path, like you've done
your entire life." I am about
to muscle through this. Oh! (whoops) I don't care what I hit.
 I'm making my own path through this brush
 and I'm figuring it out. Where is this thing? This is the path?

-RACHEL: No. Sprouted coconut. So, basically,
it's, like, when a coconut falls to the ground
and starts growing a new plant. If you catch it at specifically
the right time and you crack it open,
it has, like, this fluffy, -foamy, like,
good-textured coconut.
-RACHEL: Oh! -So, that might be a good thing.
-And there's one-- No, it's a great thing.
And it's over there and it's growing, and we
can all, like, have dessert. JON: Anika is just prepared. She's a prepared person. She watched
 a YouTube on coconuts and she spotted
 a sprouted coconut, which is a trendy food in Los Angeles and also available in Fiji. The first base-- we'll want it
off the floor, right? So, we have to dig four holes. Even though I told myself before coming out here,
"Do not take the lead," I'm a project manager
 true at heart. My head cannot help but say, "Hey, guys, these are the steps "that need to happen
 in order to get "from A to Z. Let's do that." We're gonna need
way more bamboo. -RACHEL: Okay.
-SIERRA: All right. Take a loop. SAM: I love Anika

Wow! TK! Come on.
Wow. TK:
 There's no way, now, that you could look at me and say, "this guy needs to go first" or "this guy needs to go"
at all. Aysha comes over and then she starts trying to, like,
wrestle me for the key. And I'm like,
"Whoa, wait a minute." Hey, all good, man, all good.
Look, as long as we are comfortable.
(laughs) CAROLINE:
 Oh, my gosh, when TK arrived at camp, the guys flocked to him. Where you from? PG county. -Really?
-TK: Yeah, man. I already know. I was
gonna-I was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.
-Really? -Yeah.
-GABE: Hell yeah, dude. -Hell yeah.
-TK: That was good times
over there. CAROLINE: The guys fell in love with each other the moment
that they saw each other. KYLE:
I live in, like, a small town. Like, "four stoplights for

-Yeah. We got a lot
of, like, inland lakes and waterways
that connect to and from. CAROLINE:
 I'm not an idiot. I can tell. It's a bromance. GABE: Yeah. TK:
Hold on. I'm-I'm gonna
pull it with you, though. Hold on one second. Oh, hold on, here we go. I'm just pulling it this way.
There we go. GABE:
 Oh, my God. At the base
 of this really big log, I see a Beware Advantage staring
back at me, and then I kind of lean on top of it and I just put my hand over it.
 You know, instantly, I start calculating
 in my brain, "How can I get TK
 away from this? I'm not totally sure I want to bring him
that deep in quite yet. Luckily, TK leaves
 and I just get a chance alone. Once I make the decision to take it, that is set in stone. This is something
 that I want to move on fast. And a note says... "You will dig up a box
that contains "everything you need
to claim an immunity idol. "Until you take possession
of the idol, "you cannot participate
in the vote at Tribal Council. That's why it says 'Beware.'" I realized that
 the branch where I found the Beware Advantage was right on the path. And then, lo and behold, found this box
 with a lock on it and a tube, which has more instructions
 on what to do. It says... "Unbraid the vines to release
the key that unlocks the box." And of course I know
 what the rock face is. It's a massive,
 massive rock base right next to our tribe's camp. So, I know I have to bring
 what's up there down to me with these vines. I can see the key wrapped around the ring on the top
 of this rock base. My precious!
There it is. GABE:
Do you want to find out? I'm such an idiot. -You want to help me?
-Yeah. GABE:
 Right away, I was like,
 let me not play coy. Let me just bring him into this right away and say, "Let's
find out what this is together." That's a key, dude.
Dude. That's probably for the... We found a key before we found anything else. That doesn't sound right.
 Like, that's not adding up.
 So, in my mind, I'm like, "I caught you in the act
but you weren't gonna "tell me about this,
so maybe we aren't as close as we thought we were." GABE: I kind of feed TK this story
of "I just found it" and I think I he bought it. Yeah. I finally have this key
 in my possession, and I-I really
 need to find time to return to the box, but not be
 too hasty about it, because it just leads to mistakes. AYSHA: Riding back to camp with no camp supplies, I was so fearful. I'm just thinking, "I haven't just disappointed
myself in this moment, but I've disappointed my tribe." Hello. Oh, Aysha! -Aysha!
-KISHAN: Yeah! -Okay, story time, story time.
-Oh, my God. AYSHA:
 I knew that the only way to approach talking to my tribe
was being honest. I literally had nothing to hide. Um, we arrived to the beach, and there's this stand and the instructions say
there are two paths and only one tribe was gonna get the camp supplies. TEENY:
 Being a Survivor fan, I've listened
 to Aysha's podcast before. It seems like she's very bright. She picks up on a lot of things
that even I miss from the show, and that could
 be helpful for my game. -Well, thank you for going.
-GENEVIEVE: Thank you
for trying and going. I was like,
"Oh, it was for nothing." TEENY:
 So, the first thing I did
 was pull her aside and say, "Listen,
I think I know who you are. -Okay.
-And I... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right, right, right. So, I don't plan on... -I would never tell anybody.
-Okay. -I just wanted to tell you.
-Thanks. So, when Teeny approached me about recognizing me
and knowing me from Rob Has a Podcast, that made me so nervous. But I really do feel, like,
a genuine connection with Teeny. I'm just trying to make sure
that I'm not blindsided by... good vibes. SOL:
Yeah, Lavo. -TEENY: Yes.
-(Genevieve laughs) AYSHA: Everyone playing
 the game of Survivor is here to win
 a million dollars, and so I'm trusting everyone until they give me a reason
 to lose trust. Who knows
what's about to happen? AYSHA: Yeah. -Oh, for real?
-Mm-hmm. Ah.
Seems like my whole tribe likes me, which is good. I said that
 when I start this game, the main thing that I want to do is immediately start looking
 for advantages and try to do it
 in the smartest way. It is hard,
in this new era of Survivor, to look for these advantages
and not get caught. I need to go this way. I don't know. I just-- I... I feel like we just-- Yeah. ROME:
 On day one,
 looking for an idol-- that could put a huge target
 on your back. But at the end of the day, I want to play this game
 as hard as possible. So I have to make sure
 that if I'm looking, I am looking everywhere, and if I look everywhere, I feel like I'm-a find it. (gasps) I didn't even
 see the word "beware." I just see the word "advantage." That's all it is.
 Because guess what? That advantage is gonna be in my
hands instead of someone else. It said right there at the path, you'll be able to find a box with everything you need
to get your idol. Oh, my gosh. Once I started
 to dig on the path in the broad daylight, that was when I realized,
"This is not a good idea." Thing is, it's right there
 where everyone's walking. It's directly
 on the way to the well. And so I almost
 have to do this at night. I just feel
 absolutely incredible at how I'm playing the game

understandably so. -Let's run into it.

-CAROLINE: Let's go, Tiyana! (whoops) GABE:
 But I've had a lot of time to be excited.
 Now's not the time to be excited, now's the time
to take care of business. It's why we're here.
It's what I plan to do. I found a key earlier today to unlock this box
 buried in the ground, but TK walked up and caught me. And now I'm realizing
 I need somebody to keep an eye out for me. And Sue was somebody
 that I could work with to actually accomplish the tasks that were at hand. When he told me he found
 the Beware Advantage, that was huge. Like, I never expected
anybody to ever tell me that they found an-an advantage. -All right.
-Okay. He'll be coming
from what direction? Okay. So, I'm definitely
 gonna be the lookout for when Gabe goes off hunting
for this advantage. ♪ ♪ The fire's doing good. GABE:
 I hear from Sue, and I have no more time. I grab that lock that's
 hooked on the box and I just rip it out of the ground
 as hard as I possibly can and I just take off sprinting. Let me just get off this path
as soon as I can. Wow. Oh, my God.
 When I open it, I find a second box
 within the first box. And I'm not happy about it. I broke my neck
 to get this thing, and now it comes with this big caveat. It's only good
 for one Tribal Council. If you want to keep going,
 there's another task, and that will give you
an idol that's good for three Tribal Councils. I fancy myself a gambler
 in real life. I like betting on sports,
I like going to the casino. Scared money don't make money. So I put the one-time-use idol
 inside the smaller box and I took the clue,
 and it says, "Follow the map
to the driftwood. "Break open the driftwood
to find the key that unlocks the box." So, I realize I have
 to hide this box somewhere and figure out what the next step
of the equation is. That did not sound that great. (sighs) I don't even know
what's happening up there. I couldn't even possibly guess
what he was doing up in the rock mountains? GABE:
 I am just panicking
 and-and panicking. My heart rate is pounding. I had a rough start
 to this game. I sit here with no vote,
 no idol, a whole task to do. It's gonna be a very mentally stressful

 I'm realizing I'm not getting to know

 I trust Jon and I'm working with Jon,
 but that's it. And that makes me uncomfortable,

to find an opportunity to get a moment with Rachel. That's awesome.
I feel good about you, too. We're... in alignment.
We're synchronized. I agree. I'm like,
"You're strong. I'm strong." -Yeah. Yeah.
-I feel like it's good. Part of the appeal
 of Survivor to me is that I love games, and Andy is just the sweetest, but I don't think
 he's strategic. -...in a minute. -RACHEL: He just, like, is a little too eager, maybe, to, like, just to bond and to get to know each other. You have to be careful, though. -Maybe not tomorrow.
-Yeah, yeah. -I'll follow your lead.
-Okay. RACHEL:
 It's super suspicious to get up early
and meet on the beach to talk. Like, absolutely not.
I am not doing that, Andy. ANDY:
 I couldn't sleep. I wasn't sleeping at all. I was just in these sort of
 negative thoughts, feeling like, in this
 new community, I'm somewhere where I don't belong. And I just needed
 to talk with someone, someone I felt good about
 because I feel like... I am spiraling, in a way. -It's just that I...
-No, like, you don't
even need to say. Like, someone definitely knows
we're here, -and so, like, that, actually...
-Yeah, you're so right. RACHEL:
 One of the things
 a Survivor player shouldn't do is go off to talk.
 This is really obvious. People just heard us
 in the shelter. All right,
do you want to sit or what? RACHEL:
 And I just literally told him, "That's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do that." And then he does it anyway. It doesn't make me more confident that he's going
to be a good alliance member. ANDY:
I just can't sleep. -I just need to talk.
-No, no, you're fine. -No, tell me.
-I thought I would come in here and be a little different
than I am. RACHEL:
What did you think
you were gonna be? I thought I was gonna
be the version of myself that, like, I feel like I am today, but -feel like I'm going
a little bit backwards.
-Yeah. He's feeling insecure, and I totally empathized
 with him, but you can't take those moments
 of downness and then just kind of rip
somebody else's ga... game and pull them down with you. -We need to get the fire going?
-ANDY: Yeah. RACHEL:
Make coconuts first, then fire, -'cause we need to eat.
-Right. ANDY:
 Rachel's someone
I felt so good about on day one. -Thank you for doing this.
-Of course. ANDY:
 But I tried opening up
 to Rachel. I thought that would give me a sense of relief, but I don't feel like
 I got that closure at all. And that put me
 in a very difficult and negative headspace. ANDY:
Right now. I feel like I've felt very often in my past. RACHEL:
Yeah! ANDY:
 Sort of a high school feeling, like I'm different,
 I stick out in a bad way with a group of people all enjoying
 each other's company... RACHEL:
You're so accurate.
That's really hard to do. -ALL: Oh!
-That's a good-ass coconut. ANDY:
 ...without me. -SIERRA: Yes! Give me some.
-That was beautiful. ANDY:
 When I'm cracking my coconut, people aren't even watching me. Jon-- he cracks a coconut and there are cheers
 from everyone else at camp. And I had this gut feeling I am on the bottom. This could be my last day

 of driftwood out on the beach that has a key inside of it that
will open up the second box that will then give me
 the three Tribal idol. And the clock is ticking. So the X on the map
 says it's into the brush, and lo and behold, there's
 a piece of driftwood there. I know that there's
 a key inside of it, so, I just smash it
 like I'm Donkey Kong. (groans softly) Every slam of this driftwood-- it's deeper than
 just getting this key. This is giving my vote back. Who knows how much time I have
 before people get up, and I don't know if I'm gonna
 have another opportunity to keep looking for this thing. Come on. Oh. Come on! (sighs) Bingo. So, now that I finally have this key in my possession, I'm exhausted, but I can't wait to get back to the box. (sighs) There's a catch.
 There's a third box within the second box. It never seems to end. Leave it to Survivor to just not let me
take a breath. This was a tough call
 I was making, but this has been so damn hard. I'm really excited
 because I have power again. I have my vote back. I'm a dragon sitting on top
of a pile of gold. -Personally love him.
-Yeah, personally love him. -Yeah, I hear you.
-Yeah, truly. SOL:
 I-I really think
 he has something. Last night, I dug up a box. There was a gigantic lock
 on the box, and then I found the scroll, and I knew there was no way
 I was gonna be able to read the scroll
 in the pitch black. And so, today,
 I walked away by myself so I can read this advantage
and do the next step. "Soak... soak the drift..." That's so random.
Okay. All right.
I can do this, though. Once I got that second clue, I realized, "Okay,
 this is absolutely insane." But, man, if I can find this
and get this done fast, that'll be awesome. All of a sudden,
 I heard a twig snap. I look up,
and Aysha's right there. Hey. Huh? ROME:
 Granted, I don't think
 she saw me pouring water on the driftwood, but she saw me
looking really, really hard. -And...
-Like, fully, like... -Fully looking.
-Okay. Where was he looking? AYSHA:
By the rocks. We need to see
if he's still over there. Rome is playing amateur hour. He's searching for idols,
 and he's a complete liability. Rome is off his rocker. (whispering):
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. The key to the box "is at the bottom of the well." When I read that,
my heart dropped. (grunts) It feels so, so difficult. You can almost feel like
 Jeff wants someone else to be able to know,
 he wants someone to catch me. I got the key. I know
 that the key unlocks the box. I'm hoping that
I can go open this box up and that there's gonna be an
immunity idol right inside it. (quietly):
Here we go. What? AYSHA:
 Me, Teeny, Kishan

I snuff your torch. That goes for everybody. You're all gonna feel down.

Let's go. Come on. PROBST:
All right, so, Gata. What is happening right now? Jon, can you give
any perspective? How does Andy's confession impact anything? JON:
Uh, what I take from Andy-- uh, previewing a trip for me under a bus-- is... is that he is wrestling with the fact
that he wants to stay and he values
the relationships he's building. But he knows that
in a situation like this, you may have to turn
on people you care about. PROBST:
All right, Gata,
Tribal Council tonight. Somebody from Gata
will be the first person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing--
sorry for you-- I'm gonna take your flint. Thank you, Rachel. You'll have a chance to win
it back in the next challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight at Tribal Council. Thanks, Jeff. ANDY:

 I mean, people have had meltdowns, but I don't think
 it's ever happened in front of everybody else. RACHEL:
 The other tribes-- their jaws were like... "What?" And, I mean, so was mine. ANDY:
On the mat, I was at 80%. But I've fully
gathered my thoughts now. Survivor is a game of paranoia. It's extremely possible that
I was just susceptible to it. I realize now,
in many ways, how unfair some of the things
that I said... Some of the things that
have always plagued me have just started
bubbling up insecurities that date back decades, right? ANIKA:
 He said he was 80%.
 He wasn't 100% better yet. Which makes me nervous. All of us aren't
gonna be 100% out here. That's the whole entire point
 of the game. If you're gonna have outbursts

something like that before. And because of how
 it all went down, like, you would think that
 they're going for Andy, but I'm a little bit paranoid
 because I feel like I have been
 struggling to fit in, and that makes me nervous. So I'm gonna go feel it out. ANIKA:
Do you want to talk about Andy? JON:
Yeah. I'm a little frustrated because, like... -He called you out.
-I know.
-He called me out. And it's like, "Hey, man, "like, we've-we've been
talking for two days. I genuinely, really like you." This is somebody that I was,

play a game with him? It stinks. -RACHEL: This stinks.
-It just stinks. It... So, like,
I think we need to, like, tell him it's you. Is that okay?
Cause I just don't know that he's gonna believe anything else
because he already is the one that's pitted himself
against you. Okay. -I mean, right?
-I know, that's true. JON:
 Anika, Rachel and Sierra are all saying it's Andy, but they all immediately
are like, "And we're gonna tell Andy it's me," which sucks. Uh... SIERRA:
 Bring it in. We got to get to the end here. What I'm hearing
 doesn't totally make sense, so I'd much rather

-I want to stay.
I want to stay, too. -I want you to stay.

throw you under the bus. -Okay.
-And that's my... But what do you want to do? Anika. Anika is the person I want gone. -Okay.
-How do you feel about that? I... I would like to do it. ANDY:
I'm patching things up with Jon, and he gives me sort of, like,
 a lifeline for me in this game to get out a person
 I actually want out, which is Anika. At this point, my main, core priority
over everything is just fighting to stay in the game. JON: If we can turn this into
a move, I think we can turn... -Yeah. Yeah.

 would be our option there. JON:

 but I'm not doing that. I'm starting to think Jon is playing hard. -JON: We can make this work.
-SAM: Yes. -I got it, right?
-Okay. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go. He's a strategist. He's very, very smart,
 which is dangerous for me. And Andy is strong. He might be able to help us win a challenge or two. ANIKA:
I know we're at a point in the
game where we need strength, but will we actually
win more with Andy? Because he is messy and not only
in his words, but, like, -all he is is brute force,
and it's not even
-SIERRA: That's so true. -that strong a force. -SIERRA: Having somebody like Andy can be a liability, and it's somebody we definitely
 need to worry about. However, I think
 right now we need strength. I don't think these challenges
 are going to get any easier. We need some strength
and, honestly, we're not getting that from Jon. I think we need to touch base
and get on the same page. -Yep.
-Yeah.
-SIERRA: We have to be quick. We need strength right now. I think that makes sense.
Right now, I would vote Jon. RACHEL:
I still really worry about Andy imploding again.
Like, yesterday was a bad day, today's a bad day. He's given up
halfway through the challenge -before we even lost.
-ANIKA: Mm-hmm. I just think there's legitimate
pros and cons to both. If we keep Andy, I think he's more loyal
 to me than he is to anybody else on our tribe. But I don't know that
 that's actually a good thing because Andy is a ticking
 time bomb and you don't know when it's gonna explode. On the other hand, if we keep Jon, who is
more even keel and levelheaded, we might lose the next
 few immunity challenges without Andy's strengths. I am genuinely torn. Our ability as a tribe to make the right choice

to Anika. I mean, she definitely led the tribe
for a good bit. She had the basics and got us, like,
a good base start. PROBST:
Anika, walk me through that. How did you step up
to be the leader? So, I'm flattered
that you think that. Um, I had general consensus
and a general idea of what we should be doing,
realistically. -How would you
describe camp, Jon?
-JON: I think we spent the first three days finding commonality. You're doing that
because you genuinely want to. There are genuine connections, those are real,
you can't fake it. And even if you wanted to,
I don't think you ultimately could succeed unless you were,
like, a sociopath. And so, yes, we're a community,
but we're also competitors. And I think a little bit
out of fear and trepidation, people really were reluctant
to break out into groups and start
having strategic conversations. So, a bit of a delayed start
to the strategy part? Uh... yes. PROBST:
All right, let's get
into the emotional part of the first three days, Andy, -all circling around you.
-Yeah. Today at the immunity challenge, what stood out to me were the comments you made
about your tribe. -Yeah.
-"Nobody noticed me
open a coconut. Nobody likes me.
Everybody wants me gone." Walk me through that
a little more. Well, I feel like I grew up on the outside, 100%. I never felt like I belonged, but coming into this experience, I felt like I changed just by getting rid of all this, like, need to please people. PROBST:
So, you're saying,
in your recent life, -Yeah.
-just back home, you felt like you've broken out
of that feeling left out. -Yeah.
-And do you feel like
you have a community? An unbelievable community
has formed around me, and it did not happen overnight. It was because
I challenged myself. I kept saying yes to things. I kept putting myself
out of my comfort zone, and succeed or fail
based off of that. PROBST:
So, it's fascinating -that you would work so hard
-ANDY: Yeah. and then sign up
to take on the biggest test -Yeah.
-of social resiliency anybody could
ever volunteer for. ANDY:
But I've made myself
ready to conquer that. And now I can go show,
you know, the world, any-- everyone in my life,
you know, how far I've come and how, you know,
easy it will be for me now, which is not the case,
as we can see. PROBST:
So, Jon, regardless
how it played out today, do you respect the fact
that Andy's intention of coming out here was to try
to take on this social test? Um, did Andy have a moment? People have moments. Sometimes they happen
on a beach in Fiji. People shouldn't be judged
by their worst moments, even if you are frustrated
that they're saying it -in front of everyone,
including Jeff.
-(laughs): Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.
-JON: So I don't think
any of us came away from that not being frustrated. PROBST:
So, let's talk about that. Andy, you shared
a lot of information. -Yeah.
-It'd be very easy to say, -"He's a loose cannon.
You got to get rid of him."
-Yeah. PROBST:
So, when you get back to camp, -what did you do?
-I want to be very, very clear, and I was clear to everyone. I think it was pretty obvious that there was absolutely
zero premeditation. That old part of me just set in
and that paranoia, and now look
at these five people who Andy threw under the bus. -You only threw one person
under of the bus.
-Well, yeah. With my words.
Yeah. But despite all this, the one thing
I absolutely cannot do is say that it's okay
to vote me out. Let's just play Survivor. I will accept the result. So, Sam, what was the fallout from a strategic point of view? Because you don't want to come
back to Tribal Council again, and a lot of that is gonna
be harmony and tribe strength. I never had a perception of Andy that he was out here to do
anything other than give 100%. He fought so hard
in the challenge that he's passed out
on the side. But then he's willing
to turn on his best friend. Well, that's hard for somebody
to jump into bed with. Rachel, can Andy
recover from today? I-I... I empathize with
Andy completely, but what if he goes
on a journey and says whatever he's thinking,
which-- who knows-- you know, what plans
he has that I don't know about. But Survivor does that to you. Like, everyone has
those moments of like, "Is everybody just
lying to me right now?" PROBST:
Jon, it's interesting that playing out right now
is everything we talked about
at the marooning. The idea of building
a new community where you can feel safe in it, but then you put on top of it
the game. So, how confident are you
about the vote? I don't know
what kind of conversations would have taken place
if Andy hadn't drawn the... the evil eye.
I-I really don't know. But when you know that there's all these different
conversations going on and that there is
a natural target, it really starts
to make you wonder, who's the unnatural target? Could I be trying
to find that person? Could it be me? ♪ ♪ PROBST:
All right. It is time to vote.
Sierra, you're up. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God.
(laughs softly) I'll go tally the votes. ♪ ♪ If anybody has an advantage

All right. Jon, the tribe has spoken. (chuckles)
Time for you to go. All right. -See you.
-JON: Bye, team.
-Bye, Jon. Good job. Grab your torches.
