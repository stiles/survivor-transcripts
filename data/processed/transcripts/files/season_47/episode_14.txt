Welcome to the final episode
of Survivor 47. It's been a wild ride
these last few days, starting with Operation Italy. That took out Caroline
and flipped the game. And that sent Rachel
into stealth mode, literally crawling
through the sand like a spy to listen in on Sam and Andy and Genevieve and Teeny as they plotted her demise. So, armed with that knowledge, she made the biggest move
of the season. Played her Block a Vote
and her idol, took out Andy in a revenge vote,
flipped the game again. Then Rachel won her third
individual immunity challenge and used that leverage
to take out Genevieve. And now we're down to four: Rachel, Sue, Teeny and Sam. Two of them are gonna
sit right here. The other two
will be forced to make fire to earn that third spot. Then the final three will
face their jury and get a chance to plead their case about
why they deserve the title of Sole Survivor and the million
dollars that comes with it. And then we will crown a winner
of Survivor 47. And immediately following that,
we're gonna stay right here in this beautiful Tribal Council
and do the aftershow. It is a very big night
for Survivor. It's the finale of Survivor 47. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... I find out so much. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. I trust her.
 She shared so much with me. My loyalty to Rachel is real. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it... Jeff? I'd like to play it for myself. First vote: Rachel.
Does not count. Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member
of our jury: Andy. The tribe has spoken. All eyes on Rachel right now.
Does she have it? -Good girl.
-And she does. It's over! Rachel has won her third individual immunity. RACHEL:
 Oh, my God. I won immunity
when I needed it so bad. I've never felt more confident
that I'm less confident in what's going to happen. Genevieve just
spun me around in circles, and I'm sick of it. Fourteenth person voted out and the seventh member
of our jury: Genevieve. The tribe has spoken. They have. ♪ ♪ -TEENY: Final four.
-Oh, my God. Final four, guys. TEENY:
 I am ecstatic. I'm in the final four
of Survivor-- my dream of all time. -We did it!
-Come on! Final four! -Final four.
-Final four. TEENY:
 And I am one round away from having a chance
to pitch my case to win. Genevieve is gone.
I just want to say -It's so crazy.
-congrats to all of us. -I know.
-That girl was a legend. And Genevieve is gone. So, right now, I am riding the highest high of my entire 23 years of life. TEENY:
There were...
How many people have we beaten? -Fourteen.
-How did that happen? My daughter Chelsea's
 last text to me was, "Mom, I want you to know, "if you get voted out
the first day, we're still so proud of you." And now I'm here
in the final four. (laughs) -You guys, final four.
-RACHEL: Final four. SUE:
 It's the craziest thing, and I want to scream
 at the top of my lungs. Ah! Sam, we got to final four and we never
wrote each other's name down. -Yeah. How about that?
-I'm pretty proud of us. SAM: I'm at the final four
 of Survivor, and it's this weird, like, hybrid
of being fulfilled and being motivated. -How you feeling, Sam?
-Feeling like, uh... big day tomorrow. Because my dream was not
 to come on Survivor and get fourth place. My dream was
 to be the Sole Survivor, and I really feel like
I'm one day away. We're gonna wake up
on day 25 on Survivor. What a concept. Tonight I'm just, like, happy and feel
in a celebratory mood and just, like,
want to kind of take it all in. The last few votes,
 I've had to win to survive, and I'm not gonna stop competing now. I feel like this
 immunity challenge coming up is the last stand,
 the final battle for the four of us, and it's the most important
 of them all. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on in! What in the world? PROBST:
Take it in. This is what stands between you
and a million dollars. Four big smiles. They're nervous smiles, Jeff. Yeah, they're scared smiles. They should be. Wow. So, here we are, day 25. You've made it
to the final four. You have one
immunity challenge left. Shall we just get to it? -(all voicing assent)
-All right. First things first, Rachel. For the third time, got to take back the necklace. -Thank you.
-RACHEL: Thank you. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
 you're gonna crawl under a muddy net. You'll then use a long pole
 to unweave a rope. Once you have that rope, you'll use it to lower a gate. You'll run through it and
 collect a bag of letter tiles. You'll need those tiles
 to solve a combination lock. That'll release a machete. You'll use the machete
 to drop the ladder, climb to the finish
 where you will race to solve a hanging bat puzzle. First person
to finish wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot
in the final three. You will be
at that Final Tribal Council, where you will get a chance
to plead your case to your jury about why you deserve the title
of Sole Survivor and the million dollars
that comes with it. You also have power
because you decide who sits next to you
in that second spot and who you force to make fire
to earn that final spot. Which means one of the four of
you will be forced to make fire and you're gonna lose and your dream is gonna fall one day short. Only way to prevent that
from happening: win right now. Yeah. PROBST:
Biggest challenge of the season. We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. All right, here we go. For immunity, guaranteed spot
in the final three, Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going
back through mud again. -(grunting)
-Day 25, Survivor 47. -You want it,
-(grunting) this is where you step up -and grab it.
-(grunts) Sam through, Rachel's through,
Teeny's through. Come on, Sue! Let's dig! (grunting) PROBST: Now you're gonna untie a long pole and use it
to unweave a rope. You need that rope. Sam has his pole. That pole has
a little bit of a U. You can use that U
to grab that rope and push it up
and over those pegs. It is Sam in the early lead. Rachel's starting
to get the hang of it. Teeny doing a nice job. Sue has her first bit of rope. Sam figuring it out. Once you're there,
knock off the ball. Sam has his. Now you got to untie more knots,
get through that little gate. Rachel has hers. It is Sam and Rachel. You should be used
to these knots by now. They are a staple on Survivor. Sam is through his knots. Rachel's through hers. Sam and Rachel pulling ahead. Gonna use that ball
to try to lower the gate. Sam almost does it
with his first shot. Rachel just misses. Here comes Teeny working
on her knots. Sue working on her knots. You got to figure out the slack, 'cause you need that ball
to travel. -Ah.
-PROBST: Sam's a little short. -(grunting)
-PROBST: Here comes
Teeny and Sue. Everybody in this. -Sue launches. No.
-Aah! -(grunts)
-Teeny launches. PROBST:
Rachel has a shot if she can get it to come down. Close. Will it work? Rachel's done it!
She's through first! (grunts) Rachel now working
on her letter tiles. It is Rachel in the lead. Big immunity on the line. Everybody fighting right now. Gonna use the letter tiles, try
to solve that combination lock. -Aah!
-Sam still trying
to lower his gate. -(grunts)
-Teeny's still working
on her gate. Sue working on her gate. Sue... lowers her gate. Let's go, Sue! -(grunts)
-PROBST: Sue falling through. That's 25 days
of exhaustion on Survivor. Rachel still in the lead. You've got letter tiles
to help you solve this. You've got a clue. Teeny and Sam still struggling. Now is when
you really feel that pressure. (grunts) PROBST:
Teeny drops her gate. Teeny now working
on the letter tiles. Here goes Sam. Sam very close.
Can he get it to drop? Sam has his gate!
You're through. We got a challenge! Got a clue,
you've got letter tiles. You're trying
to solve that one word. Sam quickly gets
his letter tiles. Everybody now
on the combination lock. It's a word this time,
not numbers. It's what you need to do now. Sam thinks he has it. And he does.
Sam got it very fast. Covers his word up
so nobody can see it. Sam, with one swat,
knocks down his ladder. Rachel has it. Does not cover it... -Ah!
-PROBST: ...leaving it open. Now Rachel's gonna cover it. Sam heading up
to work on that bat puzzle. Rachel drops hers.
Got to get through the knots. Teeny solved it. It is Sam in the lead. Rachel now heading up
her ladder. Teeny trying to drop her ladder. PROBST:
Sue has the word. Still taking her a while
to get it. She's got it now. Rachel now joins Sam. -(Teeny grunts)
-PROBST: Sue will be
up here soon. Teeny's now trying
to drop her ladder. Still working with that machete. Sam did it in one swat. Sue has hers.
She's heading up. -Let's go, Teeny!
-(grunts) Here comes Sue. Sam with another piece
on this bat puzzle. PROBST: It would be Sam's first individual immunity win
of the season. Rachel's at three. Teeny drops hers!
Everybody's still in this. One piece at a time. Sam with another piece. Here comes Teeny. Sue is quickly
getting into this puzzle. Sue has won
one individual immunity. Teeny has not won. Sam has not won. We know Rachel's story.
She's trying to tie a record. Four women have won
four immunity challenges, but Sam is ripping
through this early. Puzzles have not
been his friend so far, but today might be
a different story. Teeny looking for another piece. Sue trying to find one. It is Rachel and Sam right now
side by side and very close. Rachel with another piece. Sam looking
to place another piece. Will it fit? No! Rachel with another piece. And another. Now Rachel in the lead over Sam. Sue is in it, down on the end. Teeny's in it. Teeny, just gonna go right next
door. "I'm just gonna look." Now Sam's doing the same thing. No pride on Survivor. What that means is
you're looking at somebody else's puzzle. That means you are trailing. Rachel with another piece. Rachel starting
to pull away now. There have been over 350 woman
that have played Survivor over 46 seasons. Only four have won
four immunity challenges. Rachel down to three pieces. Rachel down to two pieces. Rachel down to her last piece. Rachel thinks she has it. She does not. Something is not right. This challenge is still alive. That is opening the door
for everybody else. What is it? Puzzles look right
when they are finished. Your life in the game is
on the line right now. Keep fighting. Rachel making a switch. Is that it? That's it!
Rachel's done it! Claims a spot in the final three and in the Survivor hall of fame. Wow, what a final challenge. Rachel, come on over. For the fourth
and historic time, immunity is yours. You're in a very
elite group now. Only five women--
including yourself-- over 46 seasons have won
four individual immunities. The biggest thing
is you are guaranteed a spot in the final three.
So, what is the feeling, knowing you accomplished the goal,
you made it to the end? I don't have words
right now, Jeff. I mean, to be standing here
with this necklace on-- it's overwhelming
and it's incredible. And yet, at the same time,
in my gut, I, like, knew I could do this. And I just think that, like,
everything I do in life, I do with
incredible determination. And I didn't know
if I could do it out here, and I'm so proud that I-I have. -Congratulations.
-Thank you. So, tonight at Tribal,
you have a lot of power 'cause you're gonna decide, between Sam, Teeny and Sue, who you put in that second seat
at the final three and which two players you force
to make fire to earn it. You have the afternoon
to figure out what you're gonna do
with that big decision. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council for the final
fire-making showdown. -Congrats.
-Thank you. SAM: Rachel wins
 immunity yet again, and I feel defeated. I've tried
 to knock her out of this game, I've tried to beat her
 at a challenge, but my plan has been foiled. And I know pretty much
 immediately I'm making fire
for my life tonight. ♪ ♪ TEENY: Ooh. (mutters) RACHEL:
 The feeling right now is a little bit of disbelief that this is where I am
right now in this game. You're forever
in the hall of fame. It's... I'm so proud of you. -Thank you.
-Yeah. That was kick-ass. RACHEL:
 I've tied an immunity record. It never occurred to me
that I could win four. -Well, I'm gonna go wash off.
-I'm gonna go wash off, too. RACHEL:
 And so, the fact that I'm tying Jenna Morasca, Chrissy Hofbeck, Kim Spradlin and Kelly Wiglesworth-- that's so cool.
But it also reminds me that
 Kelly and Chrissy didn't win, and they both got to the end. And so, I have to make
 the right decision tonight when it comes to fire-making
 so that I set myself up to truly clinch this win. -I need to go under.
-RACHEL: Yeah, me too. Let's just do it, okay? Yeah. I mean,
I can just tell you. Like, you two are going to fire.
I'm not gonna, like, hold a... No, I know,
I know, I know, I know. RACHEL:
 Sue has been the only loyal ally I've had in this late stage
 of the game, and this wouldn't feel right
without her sitting next to me in the final three. After tonight, one of us
will no longer be in the game. RACHEL:
 And the person I know that I want
 in fire tonight is Sam. He is someone
 that I've been trying to get out for a long time,
 and I think I could put myself into fire
if I needed to. And I was prepared,
if I lost the challenge, that I was
going to fire tonight. But I think that when I take a step back
 and I look at my game, I don't think that knocking
 Sam out directly is going to elevate me
 in any substantial way. And Teeny could be a formidable, like, opponent to Sam. You're gonna let me make fire? -Yeah.
-All right. -I'm down.
-I'm down, too.
I have no choice. Like, you don't need
to be like that. -Like what?
-Arrogant. I'm not arrogant. "You're gonna let me make fire?" My worst-case scenario
 was Rachel winning because I knew that she would
put me and Sam into fire-making. I've been threatened by Sam since before we even met
out here on this island, in the sense
that he's super smart, he's charismatic, and he knows this game
 like the back of his hand. And a part of this game is fire. -Shut up!
-I swear, I've never
made a fire once. -RACHEL: You've never
sparked the flint?
-No. -I don't want
to hear from you until tonight.
-It's okay. TEENY:
 Sam is telling us, you know,
 he never practiced fire. But in my mind, it's all a ruse
to try and get in my head. All right, well,
I need to practice. It's a shame
I don't know how to make fire. I'm leaving. TEENY:
 I'm just sick of Sam. And the last thing
 I need right now, when I'm about
to compete against him in such
a high-pressure situation, is him pulling these mind games
yet again on me. You just want the, like,
best shavings possible. Hold your knife like this. And then put the knife
on the... like, here. -(knife scraping)
-Yeah. I see what you mean.
I think I'm getting it. RACHEL:
 I want Teeny sitting with me
 in the final three. And so, I'm like,
"I will help you, Teeny." You're, like, sparking really
well, and you got flame. Okay. Teeny needed a little bit
of encouragement, and she needed a little bit
 of technique change, and she's killing it. Okay. I hope Sam doesn't know
what he's doing. -I hope Sam doesn't know
what he's doing.
-Me too. Just go slow. -Thank God that
 Sam sucks at doing fire. -(groans) SUE: We all thought
 Sam was lying to us, that he actually
 has been practicing fire, and that he was gonna be good. He's not good.
It's-it's, like, pathetic. He's gonna feel like
an idiot, honestly. Just take a breath. (exhales) SUE:
What I've seen from Sam today... (scoffs)
I could easily beat him in fire. But I'm gonna go with
 what Rachel wants to do and just sit
 and be able to relax tonight, knowing that
 I'm going to the end. How's it going? No idea how to do this. I've gone 25 days. I maybe touched a flint
 one time. Very bad for me right now
because now I'm starting to wish I would have done
a little bit more to prepare
 for this potential moment. Like, making fire
 is a foreign concept to me. And it makes me really nervous
 that Teeny has a coach like Rachel who definitely knows
 what she's doing, and I've got no help. I know everybody's
 rooting against me. Guess who's at camp, pissed
that he's not getting ...? -I believe him.
-TEENY: Huh? He doesn't know what he's doing. -He's playing it up.
-I don't know. Maybe. -But he looked, uh,
genuinely annoyed.
-Thank you. -Genuinely.
-That actually helps. RACHEL:
 I feel like Teeny has really gotten her confidence up. She's ready to take on Sam. -I'm proud of that.
-You should be. And I believe she will best him tonight. I think that
 she knows what she's doing. She just has to go in
 and not panic. -Ah.
-That looks good. RACHEL:
 And have the confidence
 to get this done. That you? Yeah. When I see Teeny is making fire, I'm like, "Oh, crap." I'm in way over my head tonight. I'm scared. I'm worried a little bit,
you know? I, uh... You don't want to play 25 days
and come up that short. And I can... feel it slipping away
a little bit. So... I'm afraid
of what's gonna happen. I'm afraid
of looking like an idiot. I'm afraid
of everybody at home saying, "Why didn't you practice fire?" And me saying, "I don't know."
(laughs) And then I pulled out
 my letters from home, and there was something
 that my dad wrote to me. He had written that he knew I would give it absolutely
 everything I have out here, and that he wasn't
 gonna bet against me. And the thought of him rooting for me... told me,
 "You're not one to quit." That really fired me up. I'm not ready to go home.
 I want to see day 26. I've got to find a way to get myself
 to the end of this game. I'm on Survivor for a reason. The second you let your brain
start to get to a point of doubt is the second that you've lost. And I'm not ready
 to go there yet. I-I can't believe it. I made a fire
 and I-I built it up. And that's when I said,
let's go into Tribal Council... ...with some momentum
 and let's go to war. ♪ ♪ TEENY:
 Right now, the only thing standing between me... ...and the Final
Tribal Council... TEENY:
 ...and a chance
 at a million dollars... ...is one fire. ...is a flame
burning through a rope. It is the biggest opportunity I've ever had to change my life
 and accomplish a dream that I've been working towards since I was a conscious,
living human being. SAM:
 I have scrapped my way
 all the way to the end of this game
 on my own. So, I'm hoping that
 tonight I can find a way to find a way yet again. ♪ ♪ Now bring in
the members of our jury. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
Okay. So, let's talk
about today's challenge. Rachel, you win your fourth individual immunity challenge and in doing so, you accomplish
the goal of every player, which is tomorrow night
at Final Tribal Council, you will get a chance to face
your jury and make your case about why you're the player that is most deserving
of the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars that goes with it. We also have to take a moment to formally acknowledge that, with your fourth
individual immunity win, you join a very elite
group of women. Out of 47 seasons and 24 years, only five of you have ever won
four individual challenges. Sam, the other side of Rachel winning four
is the reminder that of the four other women,
only two of them won the game. This is not a slam dunk
that this season is over. It's just recognizing
a big achievement from a player. Yeah, absolutely.
Like, I, like everybody else, am overjoyed for Rachel, but at the same time, the necklace doesn't
win you a million bucks. And as a player in the game,
and hopefully, as jury members out of the game, we're able to separate the idea of history that should
be recognized and admired and what it takes to outwit, outplay and outlast. And, Rachel, that brings us to
the other part of winning today is this power you have
that comes with a decision. Which of these three
do you give that second spot at the final three
and which two players do you force to go make fire
and earn it? RACHEL:
Yeah. I feel like I could go to fire
and try to take out Sam, but I also feel like I earned this necklace today
in a challenge and I don't think
that I need to give it up to do another challenge
and prove whatever that proves. I mean, I came into this game being extremely loyal
to the people that I wanted to ally with. And what I learned
pretty quickly is that none of them
were as loyal to me as I was willing
to be loyal to them until I found Sue. And Sue has genuinely been the most loyal person to me and so I only feel like it is
fair to bring her to the end. And so Teeny and Sam -will be making fire.
-PROBST: So, Sue, -you're in the final three.
-SUE: I am. Thanks to Rachel. PROBST:
So, Teeny, two things of note
that Rachel said. One is she's rewarding Sue
for loyalty. What she also said is, "I could have taken a shot
at fire to take out Sam." So, does this create an
opportunity for you? Does this surprise you? What do you
make of that statement? Um, I feel like I have an acute sense of awareness of what these people
think of me, how they underestimate me
in this game, but it doesn't matter, necessarily, what these people think of me.
It matters what these people think of me
and it matters that I get to the point to be able to pitch my case. So, this is absolutely
an opportunity. And it's funny that it's me
and Sam because I would say Sam and I have had
a complicated relationship, and it's more my end of things. "It's not you, it's me"? Yes, absolutely.
I would say that I've had a bit
of a one-sided rivalry with Sam, and to open up
about it honestly is that I look at Sam
and I see a handsome, smart, athletic, strong guy. And Sam's somebody who,
probably when he was younger, got a lot of, like,
attention from girls. The teachers wanted him
to be the kid who was, like, moving the desks
around the classroom. -Moving desks?
-And, like, that's
kind of the thing that I always wanted
to be doing, and, because of, you know,
my identity and my gender, just to say it, like, that's not
necessarily the experience I've gotten, and I've worked
really hard to get to a place where I'm more confident in,
like, this version of myself and how I present
to the world now. And I'm still
working through things. So, when I see Sam,
he's done nothing, honestly, throughout this game
but try and work with me. But I've projected
insecurities onto him and I've tried to get him out, on top of the fact
that I do see Sam as a threat and a really good Survivor player, too. So, right now,
the two of us making fire, it's an opportunity
for one final showdown. And if I can beat him, that's a great end
to the story for me. And if I can't, then
I'll have more to say after. PROBST:
Sam, how about for you? Opportunity? Yeah, I-I'm excited
for the opportunity. I'm at peace
with the result tonight. I'm ready to plead my case. I'm ready to fight like hell. Uh, last I checked, yeah, my torch
still has fire in it, so I'm ready to go. PROBST:
All right. So, here's how it's gonna work.
Teeny and Sam, you're gonna take a spot
at the fire-making stations. Pick whichever one you want. Oh. PROBST:
I'm gonna give you both a minute to take a look at your supplies, figure out how you're gonna
start this fire-making showdown, and then we'll go. Sam? All right, it is time for the fire-making showdown between Teeny and Sam. Each have the same job:
create a fire that burns high enough
and hot enough to burn through that rope and raise a flag.
You do that, you're in the final three. You don't, you're out and become the eighth member
of our jury. Are you ready to begin? -Yeah.
-Yeah. Good luck. Begin. Takes three things
to make a fire. You need fuel. That can come
from the magnesium. That can come
from the husk you're using. You need heat. That's gonna come from striking that flint. And then you need air. Fire's got to breathe
in order to burn. Lots of different ways
to approach making a fire. Both players prepping
a little bed, now scraping magnesium. That's a great igniter. And you get the heat you need from striking that flint and get a little bit of a spark. Teeny has a baby flame.
Can she get it? -That hessian
is limited in supply.
-Yes. There you go. PROBST: It'll burn quickly. And it'll burn out just as fast. Key is you got
to make something happen while you have the flame. Teeny is nursing that fire, adding little pieces
of kindling. It looks like it might be
positioned just under that rope, which is where you want it. PROBST: Sam continues to work, trying to get
his first real flame. Teeny has kept her fire going
and it's starting to increase. She's adding more sticks. This could be
a million-dollar fire. PROBST:
Teeny's fire continues to burn. Sam yet to get a flame. Still a long way from burning
through that rope with that wind starting to blow.
That's gonna be a factor. Sam now feeling the desperation, trying to get it to spark
and hope it ignites. PROBST: Teeny is doing a nice
job, slowly nursing that fire. Now that flame's starting
to burn higher, nicking that rope. Sam continues to try
to fight to get in this. Teeny's flame is now starting
to hit that rope. You can see the fibers
on that rope lighting up. Little by little,
that rope is getting frayed. There's another burn
of the rope. It's right under the rope now. Sam needs to get something
going to have a shot at this. Sam's got a flame going now. Sam trying
to get back into this. He's got to make something
out of that flame quickly. Can he nurse that
into something? Teeny's fire now with a gust
of wind. That helps. -Yeah.
-Keep going. PROBST: Anything that lifts it
closer to the rope. She's got a good foundation. Sam is trying
to build a foundation without smothering it. Blow, blow. PROBST: Sam is trying
to get his going higher. Can he catch Teeny
and make a game of this? Teeny adds another stick
and another. That flame is burning
all around that rope. Sam's got a flame going now. Can he catch Teeny?
We got a showdown now. Two fires. This is very close. Teeny and Sam
for a spot in the final three. Teeny's rope continues to burn. It's got to break
and pop that flag. Sam is right there in it. He's trying to get that flame,
coaxing it up. -Come on!
-PROBST: Teeny has an inferno. Teeny is all over that rope. It's only a matter of time
before it pops. Would be a huge comeback if Sam could burn his rope
before Teeny's. Sam's got a big fire.
He's burning his rope. -Now the wind is blowing Teeny's
away from the rope
-No! -and Sam's into the rope.
-Yo.
-No! -PROBST: Unbelievable
turn of events!
-Come on, baby. This could come down
to seconds being the difference. Come on, baby. -Let's go!
-PROBST: Sam pulls it out! -Come on!
-An unbelievable comeback -in the 25th day of season 47.
-Holy cow. -Oh, my God!
-PROBST: Sam will earn a spot in the final three,
and a dejected Teeny. -Find a way to find a way!
-PROBST: Wow. Never seen
a fire-making challenge -that close, ever, on Survivor. -Wow. You did really well, Teeny. All right, Teeny and Sam,
take your spots back over here. (sniffles) Teeny, it takes so much to get on Survivor. It takes so much
to get through day one, then day two, all the way to day 25. All the things you've endured
to get to this spot and to get that close
and to still fall short. It's the stakes of Survivor. But it doesn't mean
it's not terribly disappointing. So, what is the feeling
right now? (sniffles) Obviously, I'm heartbroken, and... it is something I'll have to deal with forever-- that right there, that rope still not burned. But I'm at peace as well, because I played this game exactly how I always knew
that I would. I played this game
exactly how I live my life. I played this game 100% as Teeny because that's the only way
that I know how to be. And at least
I can go out now saying that I believe I would have won
if I got there, -and I'll just never know.
-(laughing) Um, and, as I said, losing
to the big handsome jock-- it's just another part
of the story that I got to deal with. PROBST:
Well, Teeny, I got to say, it's been a pleasure
having you on the show. I respect everybody
who plays Survivor. I've never played, but I've been a witness
to every single person who has played this game
for 24 years. And I continue
to learn life lessons from all of you,
including you this season. So, thank you
for braving Survivor and coming out here and
fulfilling your childhood dream. Jeff, thank you
for giving it to me. I can't even believe I'm looking
at you in the eyes right now. And that is something that
I will carry with me forever. So, I'm happy.
I know I did my best. There's nothing more
I could have done, and that's how I'll go on. And fittingly, in Survivor, the other side
of this story is you, Sam. Teeny gave it everything
she had. She came up short. You looked like you had absolutely no shot to even get a flame.
Did you have any moments where you said, "I'm done.
I'm not gonna get there"? The moment that
you let your brain get to, "I'm out," it's self-fulfilling, in a way. But I think
the story of my game... ...has been one of resilience, so, I'm elated. PROBST:
All right, Teeny, it's time.
Need to grab your torch. SUE:
Can we have hugs? -Yeah.
-Yeah. (indistinct, quiet chatter) Bring it in, brother. -I'm proud of you.
-Thanks. You too. Never wanted to do this. But it's a part of the journey. It's a part of the journey. Teeny, the tribe has spoken. -Time for you to go.
-Thanks, Jeff. -Thanks for being out.
-Thank you for letting me. -You smell good.
-(Probst laughs) -Bye, Teeny.
-Good luck, guys. Rachel, Sue, Sam,
congratulations. You made it to the final three. Tomorrow night, as you know, the power in this game
now shifts to the jury. Eight players that
you had a hand in voting out will decide who wins this game. Prepare, be ready. You have one more night
here in Fiji. Try to get some sleep. You're gonna need it.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
We'll see you tomorrow night. -RACHEL: Good night.
-SAM: Good night. TEENY:
 I do think that moment will haunt me
for the rest of my time on Earth.
 But I've had to overcome a lot of emotional
 hardships out here. Throughout my life,
I've obtained this sort of sidekick energy. And out here I've learned to,
you know, be my own best friend, and it'll help me
 live my real life in ways I never did before. ♪ ♪ -SUE: Day 26!
 -RACHEL: Day 26! SAM: Talk about an alarm clock.
 Hello. -SUE: Good morning, sunshine!
 -SAM: Good morning. SUE: Final three. I want to scream! I'm so pumped!
I'm so pumped. I'm final three. Today is actually
 my birthday, and I'm 59 today. -RACHEL: Oh, my God!
 -SAM: I see -a big old thing.
-(Rachel shouts)
-Oh! RACHEL:
Oh, my God!
Chocolate croissants! What?! RACHEL:
 It was glorious. I've had some
good rewards out here, but this was just special. -Survivor 47.
-47. Survivor history right here. -Final three, baby.
-Final three. (all whooping) SAM: The final breakfast
 is an iconic Survivor moment that you only dream of when you step
on the mat on day one. -Sam's first watermelon, day 26.
-My first watermelon, day 26. I don't love it.
I'll eat it. I don't love it. You're crazy. SAM:
 The war is on pause until tonight. Breakfast this morning
 is a peace treaty for the remaining soldiers
to look at each other and just take a break
 from the chaos that is in this game. I might suggest
we get the skillet started here. -You need help with the fire?
-He's got the fire. SAM:
 In historic Survivor fashion,
 I come from behind, I win
the fire-making challenge. I earn my spot
in the final three. But now, the fate of my game lies in the hands of the jury-- eight people that I contributed to leaving this game. RACHEL:
 Talk about our fallen... -Oh, yeah.
-fallen friends. Sierra-- first member of the jury, the most beautiful sunshine
 on this season. SAM:
 Gone too soon. For me, especially.
(chuckles) SIERRA:
 There's a lot of things
 in this game that Sam did
that makes him a winner. Sam is somebody, once he sets a goal, he will make it happen. So, it's, like, I think he could do that tonight. -SUE: Who's next?
-Sol. -SUE: Sol.
-RACHEL: He is such a cool guy. KYLE:
Hey, Mr. Miyagi. RACHEL:
When we met on the merge beach, we instantly had a connection. Somebody sent me an advantage. Yeah. SOL:
 Here's what I know
 about Rachel's game. She got a lot of advantages. But I do believe that the majority of it
 wasn't just luck. Rachel makes people
 feel very, very comfortable. She's an impressive girl. So, who was after Sol? -Gabe.
-SUE: Gabe. Gabe. SUE:
 Gabe was intense. RACHEL:
 The scariest player
 in this game to me. He was the only one
I confided in. He was a good guy. GABE:
 Sue played an unbelievably loyal game. That is a very powerful thing
in the game of Survivor. And if Sue wants
 to get my vote, she needs to show that her loyalty was conscious loyalty
 and something that she was putting on sale. -SUE: Who went after Gabe?
-Kyle. -Kyle.
-Kyle. SAM:
 A guy who, two seconds into my first conversation
with him, I knew he had to go. PROBST:
 Kyle, safe tonight
 at Tribal Council. SAM:
 I will forever have respect for somebody who can bust it that hard. He's got more drive than I think
I've ever had in my life. KYLE:
 Sam deserves to win
 because I think that he played his underdog story perfectly. I mean, he owned
being at the bottom, and he found a way
 to find a way. SUE:
 Who was after him? -Caroline.
-SUE: Sweet Caroline.
-Sweet Caroline. SAM:
 I knew if your Caroline
 didn't go that the three of you would be
sitting here at the end. CAROLINE:
 Sue was the most loyal alliance partner
you could ever have. Sue played her game the Sue way, and that's
 absolutely undeniable. -Who's after her? Yeah.
-Andy.
-SUE: Andy. Oh.
-RACHEL: Oh, my God. Andy. SAM:
He was somebody who seemed like he didn't know
what he was doing out here. They don't like me. SAM: And the minute that
 I picked him up, I realized, "Whoa, you're good." RACHEL:
 I wanted to trust Andy,
 and I, like, could not for a single moment
trust him. -Okay, can we, like...
-Work together? -Maybe we can work together.
-Actually work together? -For real.
-Yeah, let's do it, Andy. ANDY:
 Rachel established herself as the threat of threats. She's made history
 with her ability in these challenges, and so, she has to have
a really good shot tonight. -SUE: Who's after Andy?
-Genevieve. SUE:
Oh, that's... Oh, wow. RACHEL:
 I feel like Genevieve and I immediately clocked each other. I was like, "This girl is smart and I am scared of her." Um, I think she felt
the exact same way about me. GENEVIEVE:
Rachel wrapped her hands around the control that
I so desperately wanted and wouldn't let it go, which is incredibly impressive. I want Rachel to stand up
 at Final Tribal and tell everyone how much better
she is than them. -SUE: And then we have Teeny.
-Teeny. RACHEL:
 It's apt her name
 is Teeny because she is the biggest personality,
 the biggest force. SAM:
 So much better at -this game than I expected.
-Mm-hmm. TEENY:
Sam had to be extremely scrappy. People did not want
to work with him. He was a pariah
at many times in this game. But he always found a foothold
 and he always found a way out. Sam made it to the end by truly playing the game of Survivor. SAM: Three of us. How far did you guys realistically think you would make it
coming into the game? RACHEL:
I wouldn't have come out here and played
if I didn't think I could win. RACHEL:
 I'm ready to go
 head-to-head with Sam and ready to kind of catch the grenades
he throws in my direction and lob them right back at him. I would say the same thing. I thought, like,
I would be good at it, but there's been a lot of times
that I felt like, -"All right,
this is the end of my rope."
-RACHEL: Yeah. "All right,
this is the end of my rope." And then I found new rope. I know that I'm going in against a heavyweight. But my story is one that's rootable, one that the jury is gonna
want to get behind. Where do you think
your turning point was? -I think
you'll find out tonight.
-Oh. Oh. I think we'll have
to talk about it tonight. I am the guy that
 nobody could get rid of. The scrappy player
of Survivor 47. And all of the lows that
I've been through in this game, all of the fighting is worth it, 'cause I've got a shot,
and I know I've got a shot. SUE:
 This is my one last chance to give myself my birthday gift that I've been
wanting to give myself. I know that Sam and Rachel
 are up there high-fiving. Those two feel that
 they're one and two and I'm just gonna be the goat,
 but everyone underestimated me. I downplayed myself the whole
 time and I fooled them all. RACHEL:
 I'm still coming in with
 the mentality of an underdog because that's when I perform my best, is when I am backed into a corner
and my only option is to kick ass. SAM:
Going into Final Tribal Council is a lot like going
 into fire-making. I'm the underdog
 and I might look dead, but you never know when I'm gonna strike
that last second flame. Tonight, I'm not just
 hoping for fire. I'm hoping for fireworks. ♪ ♪ ANDY:
 I do not know what name
 I'm writing down tonight, and if I don't see
someone own their game like they're cooks,
 they're not getting this million dollars. CAROLINE:
 You need to explain how you executed your strategy. SIERRA:
 It's not gonna just
 be given to anybody. I want them to be sweating when we're asking
 these questions tonight. ANDY:
 This season is gonna come down to the wire. TEENY:
 Tonight is gonna be a verbal bloodbath. All right. Welcome to your
Final Tribal Council. Congratulations.
This is as far as you can go. You survived every
Tribal Council you attended and you made it
to the final three. And now it's one
of the most unique aspects of the Survivor format. The power shifts from the players in the game
to the players voted out of the game.
It is the jury who ultimately decides who will win any season
of Survivor. Tonight, they're going
to be asking you questions. They're looking for information. This is your final test. You got to figure out "What is it
they want to hear from me?" Jury, I'm gonna
give you a minute to gather your thoughts,
and we will get started. PROBST:
All right. Let's get to our
Final Tribal Council. Jury, who's gonna
get us started? -KYLE: Uh...
-Think I'll kick it off. -All right, Gabe.
-I think Gabe will.
-Gabinator. So, first and foremost,
a very, very big congratulations -to all three of you.
-Thank you. You accomplished a remarkable
milestone in this game just by sitting there,
and I really hope that you're proud of yourselves.
With that being said, I will kick it off
with the first question, and we'll start with Rachel and we can just
go down the line. How do you think-- not hope-- how do you think
your game will be remembered? And is that
even important to you? RACHEL:
Um, I think my game will be remembered as... someone that fell
on their face pretty hard and had the ability to adapt and go from the most underdog,
the most left-out person in this entire room to someone that became a threat. And as much as that does matter, I didn't come in trying
to have a Survivor legacy. I came in to play Survivor. So, no, I don't really care how I will be remembered. Uh, I think my game will be remembered as scrappy, a guy who never gave up
on himself, found a way
using creative strategy, social adaptability, using some charm,
using some humor, using some self-deprecation to get himself to the end. And it does matter to me how my game is remembered. I want to leave
feeling proud of myself, and other people are... You know, admire me, in a way. -Thank you.
-SUE: Yeah, so, something that's very important that I need to share
with all of you is that today, back home,
is my birthday, and I'm not in the 40s. -I'm actually 59.
-Oh. -Wow.
-SUE: So, if I were to win, I will go down in history as being the oldest woman to ever win Survivor. And my legacy is that I get to have my grandson, who's five years old, see his grandmother make it all the way through
this whole entire game being truthful and honest,
and I want to teach him that loyalty is something that can make good guys
finish first. GENEVIEVE:
Sue, I definitely agree. Your game was, like,
all about loyalty. -Yeah.
-So, do you view
lying and deception as negative traits
in someone's Survivor game -and as sort of anti-loyal?
-SUE: Oh, no, not... I expected all of that. Look, I'm not dumb.
You know, like, "Tweedleydee," whatever,
but you know, like... "Tweedleydum"-- that's not me. So, I won't judge anybody
for who they are. I just know
I have to judge myself. -All right. Caroline.
-CAROLINE: All right. So, I would love to hear what you believe is your
biggest mistake in this game and how you recovered from it. -Let's have Rachel go first.
-Sure. Then Sam, then Sue. RACHEL:
So, I started this game
not on a good footing. I miscalculated
and I didn't understand how much game
was going on around me. And then we hit the merge. You all voted out Sierra.
I was like, "Oh, my God, what is going on?" And I decided to course-correct and completely change my game. I tried to build bonds
with Lavo and I tried
to reconnect with Andy and I had a relationship
with Sol and I started trying
to cross-check everything. I even snuck up on people. The night of your vote-out, Caroline's vote-out, Genevieve, Teeny, Andy and Sam-- they just went to the beach. And I followed them down there
and I laid under a bush and I listened
to their entire conversation. I found out that they were
all completely against me, that Genevieve had an idol, that Teeny told them
about my advantage that I got from the journey,
that Andy had flipped. That entire conversation
is a ruse, though. Like, that was
already a premeditated... TEENY:
But to push back
on that, you know, I did reveal that she had
a Block a Vote Advantage, which -does reveal that
I was against her.
-SAM: Which we are... And if I hadn't known that,
I would not have known about the next day
to play by idol. CAROLINE:
Okay. -Sam?
-SAM: Yeah. Uh, I think my biggest mistake in this game was not tying up loose ends. Things like
throwing Andy's name out as a potential
hinky vote ended up losing me a lot of trust
with allies. But I learned that this group of people
loved sharing information and I pivoted to kind of try and weaponize it a little bit. Things like a fake idol
that I can make with Genevieve and leak information to Teeny can then help me make
a strategic play that flips the game
and taking you out of it. TEENY:
I just want to ask
a follow-up on that. When you chose to reveal
that information to me and I brought it
to Rachel and Sue, -SAM: Right.
-they did not believe you. RACHEL:
Further, in a way... -Right.
-that didn't really
matter at all. -To us.
-SAM: Well, it mattered
because I didn't -want Teeny out of the game.
It was important
-RACHEL: Right, I'm s... to my game to get Genevieve. Me too. I'm saying that,
like, even if it had been real, it would have decoyed on you, -which was also fine with us.
-SAM: Sure. Yeah, we would... It...
We didn't think twice about it. CAROLINE:
I think I have enough from that, thank you.
Sue? So, Andy, I say this
with the deepest of love. -Uh-huh.
-(laughs) SUE:
You lied to me three times and you blindsided sweet Caroline. So, believing you a third time-- that was my greatest mistake. Awesome. PROBST:
Satisfied, Caroline? -Yes.
-Sol, get in on this.
-SOL: Yeah. So, as a fan
watching this game on TV, you know, I have criticism
to give players and I'm like, "What a stupid
move. Why would you do that?" And when you come out here and play you realize that watching it on TV,
you don't know ... And so, for Rachel, here's what I believe
to know about your game. I gave you
the Safety without Power vote, which saved you in the game. You found an idol clue
in the French fries. You had a Block a Vote, and you made a historic run with the immunity challenges. Give me one thing that I don't know
about your game that will blow my mind. RACHEL:
I think final six,
when I knew I was in trouble, I don't think I could have
played that idol any more effectively. Having every single person
in the game sell your game
to the jury for you without you actually leaving
the game-- that was something that I've never seen
on Survivor. That was something that I'm really proud of
that I pulled off. SOL:
Okay, so, a follow-up to Sam. Eulogizing Rachel--
it backfired on you. So, my response to Rachel... I was very intentional
with the idea of elevating
Rachel's threat level. I had to gas somebody up in front of everybody else
so that nobody's looking at me,
everybody's looking at Rachel. So, I was able
to navigate the game without the protection
of an immunity necklace. I was able to put another threat
above myself. Think the problem is you didn't
take the threat out. Saying you can't beat someone in front of the jury and then
going to the end with them is not a strategy that I think
is a very smart one. SAM:
But you made it clear you wanted
me out when you helped Teeny at fire all day yesterday and told me you didn't
want to help me because "I need Sam
out of this game." I would rather have Sam -out of the game than Teeny.
-And that's... I mean... And I would have rather
not sit next to you. But sometimes people
win immunity challenges. It didn't go perfectly, but didn't go perfectly
for anybody else sitting here. I'm all set, Jeff. Andy? My question is for Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Andy, Andy. I really believe that
we are the two biggest superfans out here, so, I know that coming into this that the likes of Mike Holloway and Ben Driebergen are not highly ranked -on your winner list.
-Yeah. -They're not, personally, right?
-No. ANDY:
But here you are,
the challenge beast. You were, in my opinion,
better than Kyle, who's amazing. -(laughing)
-ANDY: You run the analytics
on it. It's better than Kyle's. You are the idol-finder, and we all know you would
be the fire-maker if you needed to be. And you have
the worst voting record of this final three. -Yeah.
-And so, if you
want my vote tonight, you really have
to reconcile this. Yeah, you're right, that being Mike Holloway
in this game is not how I ever
saw it happening. I came into this game
thinking that my social prowess would allow me
to maneuver strategically, but I couldn't
convince other people to do my bidding
like I hoped I could out here. It just forced me to find a different way
to play the game, like winning immunity.
And yet, I had a final-three deal
with Teeny and Andy. I had a final-three deal
with Caroline and Sue. And I brought all of us together
because I was like, "This five-- this is my best option
to protect myself," if I couldn't go
on this crazy immunity run. SAM:
I think Rachel said it well
when she said she couldn't get people
to do her bidding anymore. She lost a lot
of strategic agency and social agency, which was the entire purpose
of elevating her threat level and taking out
one of her numbers. So, I don't think
she can reconcile. It was immunities
and an idol in fries that got her
to the end of this game. RACHEL:
I think it's easier to say that from your perspective,
where people weren't totally -targeting you because you...
-I got-I got voted for more than anybody here.
I'm the only one in the game that never voted incorrectly. I was voted for at four
different Tribal Councils and received a total of
ten votes throughout this game. And I was somebody
who you said, multiple times, I need out of this game
as a threat. Sierra? -(chuckles softly) Sisi.
-SIERRA: Rachel and Sam, I played my game the closest with you both and really got to know you
on a personal level. And we discussed times at home when we hit rock bottom and how you
overcame that rock bottom. I really just
want to know how you translated that in the game.
When you hit a low, what did you do to overcome
that low, and, you know, how does that reflect, like,
why you should be the name I'm writing down tonight? -SAM: Yeah, I... Oh, sorry.
-SIERRA: Sam, if you
want to take the l... Yeah, I think I... I channeled the joy that
I knew was on the other end. Uh, like, the thought of watching an epic, fire-making
duel with my parents, the thought of hearing my fiancée's voice
in my head telling me, like, "Don't you dare give up
on yourself." You know? Um, and I thought of being a six-year-old kid
watching Survivor and telling myself
and everybody around me, "I'm gonna do that one day. I'm gonna be that one day." And I thought
of letting him down, you know? And I think that
continually fueled me when I felt like I was at
my lowest moments in this game. And it's why
I continued to surprise myself and did some things
that I didn't expect to achieve out here. I really appreciate that, Sam. -Thank you.
-RACHEL: Yeah. Um, my rock-bottom day on this entire journey
was the night you went home, when I went back to camp and was like,
"I have no one in this game." And I just channeled
my husband Derek. He wrote me this note before
I came out here that said, "Any of this pain that
you feel is temporary "and you just need
to trust your instincts and I know you can do this." I was channeling him in everything that I did
and it just kept working. And in my everyday life, I've had a lot
of personal accomplishments, like, in my career, in my life, and I don't ever own the things that I accomplish. And I knew that
coming in tonight, the hardest part
about sitting here would be, like, owning my game,
truly, and just being like, "I am proud of this game
that I've played." And that's what I'm hoping
to bring home with me. Like, I look at my husband
and I see the most talented artist
I've ever met. And yet he doesn't have
that much self-confidence. And it's really hard for me
to look at him and see that. And then I realized that, like, that's probably also
what I'm doing, you know? And so, I think that
I will take that home with me and I hope to be able
to share this with him. And that is something that I
think will affect my real life. GABE:
And Sierra presented that question to you two
because of the personal relationship
that she had with both of you. And, you know, I had
a very personal relationship with Sue out here, and I'd like to hear
her answer to that question. SUE:
So, I-I found that
when I hit my low, I actually found the strength to share with my tribe. And even Kyle-- like, you hugged me and you held me. That compassion
you all gave to me gave me so much strength,
knowing I had support. I'll forever be grateful
for the kindness that all of you gave to me
at my times of weakness. PROBST:
All right, so, jury, great job. Sue, Sam, Rachel, I'm gonna give each of you
one final chance to address the jury.
They've done a really great job of giving you a chance
to defend your game. These are your last words
to them before they vote. Sue? So, at 59 years old, I came in here
and I was pretty much of a beast in my own right. I actually won
the bucket challenge and I could have outlasted
the two gentlemen that were there as well. -Yes, I could have.
-(laughing) You were struggling, Kyle. You went head-to-head with me
a couple times. -SUE: Yeah.
-We've seen how that turned out. Well, but again,
as a 59-year-old, I beat all your asses, right? -(laughing)
-I found the Beware Advantage. I stayed loyal to the people
I wanted to go to the end with, and I did get out the people
I needed to get out and, um, I would love your vote. Sam? I did not play a perfect game
by any means, but I think my game
was the most well-rounded, adaptable, dynamic and creative game of the three people
sitting up here. Social and strategic resilience, creative gameplay. I found a way
to take control of the game without raising my threat level. I found multiple pathways
to get to the end without relying
on winning immunity necklaces or buying the right item
at the auction. So, I believe that if
you're looking for the player that outwitted,
outplayed and outlasted, despite being counted out
multiple times, I deserve your vote tonight. -Rachel?
-I believe that
I am sitting here with the most dominant game
of the three of us. There were two advantages
and one idol in the post-merge,
and I controlled all of them. And that wasn't just
through luck. It was through
social connection. It was through stealthiness. I had to get an idol
when everyone was at camp, and then I had to play it in a incredibly large fashion that I feel like
made a huge statement. I won four immunities and I tied a record and I'm really,
really proud of it. And so, I sit here pleased with my game and my story, from going from a super underdog
to a big dog. And I hope I get your vote. PROBST:
All right, jury,
great Final Tribal Council. You asked a lot
of thoughtful questions. You gave the final three
a chance to defend their game and you gathered a lot
of information in the process. I'm gonna give you a moment
now to take it all in and then we will vote. ♪ ♪ All right, well, this is
the only time in Survivor when you want to see your name
on the parchment. For the last time, it is time to vote. Sierra, you're up. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go get the votes. Uh-huh. Well, we've done this 47 times. And it's different every time because of the players. Sue, Rachel, Sam, you played three
very different games, but it got you here.
The question is did it earn you
a million dollars? We're about to crown a winner of Survivor 47. I'll read the votes. First vote: Rachel. Sam. One vote Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Two votes Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Three votes Rachel,
one vote Sam. Rachel. Four votes Rachel, one vote Sam. The winner of Survivor 47: Rachel. Well, there it is! We have our winner
of Survivor 47. All it took was 26 days of living in the jungle,
playing the most complicated game
of social politics that got Rachel
a million dollars. Jury, come on over. -Celebrate your winner.
-Let's go, let's go. It was a crazy finish. There were a lot
of late-season big moves that took out
of lot of big targets and continued to flip the game. So, what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna bring in some champagne,
we're gonna bring in some pizza in the beautiful jungles
of Fiji here at the great Tribal Council.
We're gonna talk about it all. It is the Survivor 47 aftershow. We'll be right back. I need a little champagne, too.
Let's go. Aw, thank you. -Congratulations.
-RACHEL: Thank you. PROBST:
Oh, what a fun season. (all whooping) PROBST:
 Up next... We have just
crowned our newest winner. -Rachel, congratulations.
-(cheering, whooping) Andy, one of the worst starts -Yes.
-in the history of Survivor. Here's your first look
at Survivor 48. -♪ ♪
-(indistinct chatter) All right, welcome
to the Survivor 47 aftershow. There's a lot of energy.
We have just crowned our newest winner, -Rachel. Congratulations.
-(whooping, cheering) Your name will now be forever a part of Survivor history
as you join a very special list of people
who've won this game. Your name is also about to be
written down on a check -Oh, my God.
-for a million dollars. -SIERRA: Oh, my God.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God.
-PROBST: So, I want to exploit a moment.
The reason that I like doing the aftershow immediately following is because this is as pure as it will
ever get for any of you. Because you haven't been home. Nobody knows,
outside of this group, what has happened. You haven't
been influenced by social media and all the criticism
that'll come with that that you don't deserve.
So, let's time-stamp this
right now, Rachel. -You just won Survivor 47.
-(Sierra laughs)
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my... (exhales)
You can let it out. -What is that feeling
-GABE: Yes. of accomplishing something -this difficult to achieve?
-RACHEL: I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience,
because it's just so surreal that this show that
I fell in love with because I... the second I watched it,
I was like, "I have to do that." And the biggest lesson
I think I walked in with is I thought
I had such a good grasp of my strengths
and my weaknesses, and I think that this game really flipped
that completely on its head, and yet I was able
to just kind of work with it
and adapt to it and-and land myself here, and I am... I'm, like, a little bit in
shock, if I'm completely honest. I thought Sam had
an incredible Final Tribal, -and I genuinely did not know
-PROBST: Agreed. -(all assenting)
-where those votes were going, -and I got very nervous.
-Well, let's see--
let's talk about the votes. With the jury, Rachel got
all the votes except for one. -Who voted for Sam?
-Kyle. Kyle, what was--
(chuckles) I know you would
vote for yourself. Kyle, what was
the rationale for Sam? KYLE:
I just-- I really
appreciate Sam and I appreciate where he's headed in life,
his sacrifices, his ethic, the way
that he puts himself in front of
vulnerable situations. This man right here
means a lot to me. He's impacted my life greatly.
And I love him for that. -Cheers.
-(all toasting) -(whoops)
-To Sam. PROBST:
And, Sam, I want to echo what Rachel said, which is I'm closer to the audience than I am
to being a player, for sure, and I thought tonight's
Final Tribal was riveting. -Yeah.
-PROBST: So, Sam,
when you hear that, even from the woman who just beat you-- that she said,
"I got nervous, that was a really compelling argument"-- does that give you
a sense of pride even though you didn't
get the votes to win? Yeah, for sure. I mean,
I'm disappointed not to win, but I knew
it was an uphill battle coming in.
Like, I just tried to come into tonight
with the same mentality I went into fire with, you know? Come out fighting
and give it my best. I knew I could make
a compelling case. I felt like I played a really good game
that I should be proud of. And I came into tonight, like, wanting to win but at peace
with the result regardless. And, so, yeah, I'm-I'm blessed. PROBST:
Sue, I'm gonna
give you a little love. I want to share
a statistic with you. -Okay.
-Forty-seven seasons, 24 years, 700-some
people have played, 350 have been women. There have been
21 women over 50. That's five percent. Of those, there have
only been five that have made it to the end.
That's a little over -(mouths)
-one percent. You were
in a very rare group. Survivor is a tough game once you're over 40. -Brutal. Yeah.
-PROBST: And you made it
to the end. -What is that feeling for you?
-SUE: I just wanted to represent the people of my generation,
to show them that life doesn't end at 50 or 60 or 70. It's just--
You-you-- you have to just go for it,
and I just went for it. And I'm very proud of my game. I'm very proud of what I did
and what I accomplished and how I achieved it
and, all in all, you know, it's been, like,
the hardest experience yet the most
beautiful experience, and I feel like I have
a whole new family here, and I'm really
blessed to be here. Cheers to Sue. -Aw, thank you.
-(all giving cheers)
-Badass. -Sue.
-Yeah. PROBST:
Sue, you were also one of a few people to find an idol
this season. And the way each of you -found them was very unique
-SUE: Right. Yeah.
-to the situation. Rachel, you buy a burger,
get some fries. (laughing) When did you know
there was something in there? Did you see it first or did you reach for a fry
and feel it? I went to reach for another fry
and all of a sudden I saw the piece of paper
 sticking out of my fries. And it was, like,
 half sticking out. It was, like, kind of obvious. And I immediately was like, "Oh, my God." And I look over and Sol is staring at my platter. And I thought you saw it. -Because...
-Oh, I'm just a big burger fan. I know.
And so, I... Like, at one point, he was just
like, "Can I smell your burger?" And I was like, "Okay,
he was staring at the burger. And I, like, covered it up.
It was harrowing. PROBST:
Andy, I want to go back
to the first episode. -Yes.
-Day three. -ANDY: Yes.
-One of the worst starts -ANDY: Yes.
-for any player
in the history of Survivor. Und-Undoubtedly. So, Andy, give everybody else
the update. I was overheated.
I-I'm okay now. -PROBST: Okay. All right.
-I'm okay now. I'm cooled down. -All right. You feel all right?
-Yeah. Okay.
You seem emotional. Yeah.
I was fighting for my life. I'm on the bottom. I see it in their eyes when... they don't--
I crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon and they... And then I... I... They don't like me. PROBST:
But I don't want to talk about
the bad part. -ANDY: Yeah.
-I want to talk about
the recovery, because anybody
watching this season, when they saw that happen
at the challenge, they said,
"He's done, no chance." ANDY:
I... just felt the enormity
of this opportunity-- in terms of not the game
but my life. And it was, "Hey, like, if you "stay down "and if you give up, like, could you even survive that?" And so, every single
breath I take until that torch is snuffed
should be to find the will to survive. And I found this resiliency that I could
never have imagined. And it's completely orthogonal to what
I expected to happen, and-- Are we all listening
to his word choice -and wondering what they mean?
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, yeah. -Orthogonal.
-Orthogonal?
-Orthogonal. -Orthogonal.
-Orthogonal.
-The linguistic... It's a right angle.
It's not... -An-Anyway...
-PROBST: Of course! Sam, it's a right angle.
Hello? -I know.
-My bad.
-SOL: My bad. -Cheers to Andy. Well done.
-ANDY: Thank you. (all toasting) PROBST:
He turned the worst start -in Survivor history into
-Yeah. -a life-changing moment.
-Yes. Yes. On that note, quick break.
More aftershow right after this. GABE: Where'd my bottle go? PROBST: Up next... I was born the year Survivor came out. You really impressed me
with how you -carried yourself.
-Thank you, Jeff.
-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) PROBST:
 Plus, later, a first look at Survivor 48. Welcome back
to the Survivor 47 aftershow. Let's talk about blindsides. They're essential to the game.
We had a lot this season.
They grew in intensity and they grew in their impact. Genevieve, if there was
an essential quality-- outside of being able to lie-- that allows you to pull off
a blindside, what is it? You have to prepare, when you come out
to play Survivor, to experience it all.
You can fantasize about experiencing only the highs
and playing from the top. But, like, raise your hand if you played from the top
the entire time. No one.
So, be prepared to be on the bottom. Caroline, anything
you would add to that? I think another one
is being socially aware. What I personally found to be
really helpful with blindsides is thinking through
what is best for each person's game? When is it that
a blindside right now is gonna be beneficial for
this person and this person and this person? And that
is when they want to strike. Gabe, did you struggle at all with the emotional part and if you didn't, is that
because you turned it off -or you just don't struggle?
-(Genevieve chuckling) Uh... I don't think I struggle
with the emotional part so much.
I-I mean, look, I-I was able to come into this game and say,
like, "It's just a game. "I'm coming out here to win
the title of Sole Survivor and to make a million dollars." So, I knew that I was
gonna break some eggs making an omelet.
And that's what you got to be prepared to do
if you're gonna be a good chef
on Survivor, right? Teeny, you grew up
watching this show. Now you're out here
playing this show. What would you say to somebody
who's never gonna play, "Oh, here's what you need to
know in order to understand why this game is so difficult"? You know, being somebody who--
I was born the year Survivor came out.
Sorry to age anybody. -Wow.
-But-- Yeah. I mean,
like, I've grown up with this show.
And you have to realize that we're all, at our core,
obsessed with Survivor. And so when you come out here, you start at the baseline of we put so much
sacrifice into this, we put so much work into this and we put so much love and pressure on ourselves
because of this. So, every single
round of the game is life or death. So, to have to overcome that and make hard
decisions while you're starving, while you're stressed out, while you're unsure
of who's lying to you-- it is almost frustrating. Because I know that nobody that I ever explain this to
will fully grasp what it is that
we've had to do out here. And I hope that I was able
to articulate that well enough. PROBST:
Teeny, I just want to say,
as you mentioned, you were born, basically,
when Survivor started. Really impressive to see a young person
come out here and play a game with people--
some of which are quite a bit older
and have more life experience-- and the young person
never thinks that's a deficit. But, being around here
for a while, it is.
Life experience matters. You really impressed me
with how you carried yourself. So, I hope you're proud
of the game you played. -Thank you, Jeff.
-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) Thank you.
I really appreciate that. -GABE: Teeny chill, Teeny chill.
-Teeny, cheers. Okay, now we have to
turn the corner. -It's hard to say goodbye--
