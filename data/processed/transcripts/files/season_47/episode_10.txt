French Toast Sticks... you thought wrong. But that's okay. I'll still let you have mine. At Jack, every
bite's a big deal. Welcome to
Jack in the Box! Can I hit a dance
for the people back at home? -SOL: Oh! Hey!
-(rhythmic grunting) -(laughing)
-Ah. Ah! PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... ANDY: Sol. GENEVIEVE:
 In this game, I am a planner. GENEVIEVE:
 And this Sol plan has "Genevieve Mushaluk"
written all over it. Okay, I won't. S... Shut up. I should have never
said anything to Sam. -What?
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 Voting out Sol is going
to burn my bridge with Teeny. Ninth person voted out and second member
of our jury: Sol. (sniffles) The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ No, I'm sorry,
'cause you were so close, so close
to accomplishing the goal of making me look stupid
for no reason. I... am devastated
that Sol went home. And Genevieve
 is actually the one who orchestrated
 Sol's blindside to begin with. And I only found this out
 from Andy during Tribal Council. Of course I do.
Of course I obviously do. But, like, give me a second. TEENY:
 I'm just pissed off. I don't want
 to be treated like an idiot. Once again, I'm back
in this position like I am when Kishan went home, where Genevieve has just
 completely blindsided me. I've never been more left out
 or confused or completely in the dark on what was going on. And that is the worst feeling
you can have in this game, is not knowing what's going on and being blindsided by
 your closest alliance member and having to then blindside your other
closest alliance member. I cannot honestly believe that you would not include me
on the plan. Like, I can't.
Like, it actually just speaks volumes
to how you see me, and, like, I'm... hurt. I have wanted Sol out for so long. -And that's...
-And the only reason I didn't do it earlier
was because of my emotional connection
with you. He was not good for my game,
Teeny, at all. That's why I don't want
emotional connections with everybody because I already
feel so beholden to you. And when I see you crying,
like, I genuinely regret what was a good,
right move for me. I knew there would be fallout from the Sol vote. The fallout's name is Teeny. But I did not
 anticipate the fallout being Teeny feeling like
 it was intentionally done to humiliate her. And I try very hard not to have any
 emotional connections to people in this game because
 it makes it harder to play. And when you... hurt someone and see them so distressed and know that
is entirely your fault... ...doesn't feel
like a fun game anymore. (laughs)
Sorry. Our relationship -is, like...
-I know. I just... so ... complicated. -We're so different.
-I know. 'Cause I'm, like, "Everyone's telling me the truth
all the time." And I'm like, "My closest person
is lying to me." Like, that's... that's... I'm never lying to you. I know, but at some point,
you will, and you will have to
for your own game. Teeny and I had
 very honest discussion, and we both kind of acknowledged there's an end coming for us, and it's not sharing
a million dollars. TEENY:
Okay. I don't know
 if I believe Genevieve. I'm playing this game
with so much emotion, which was my biggest fear
coming in here, and I don't know
 how to switch it off. Honestly, my head
 is in a swirl, and after this Tribal Council, I truly don't know
how to pivot in this game. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -Dude, it's okay, Teeny.
-It wasn't a good night. It was not a good night. And you didn't freak out.
You cried. You didn't, like,
scream at people and... And I did snap
at Genevieve, but... Well, I think she knew
you were gonna be mad. Yeah. How did things go last night,
from your perspective? Unfortunately, everyone knows
I'm behind the Sol vote, including Teeny, who is holding
it against me, personally. So, that is why I need to be careful today, because tallest blade of grass gets cut, and I grew a lot yesterday. What do you want to do now? What do you think? And so now, there's four relatively strong Tuku. And so, I think today, everyone's gonna be
eyes on the four, 'cause we'd like
to get it down to three. How are things this morning? Genevieve was just here. She says she's down
for splitting up Kyle and Gabe. Okay, but Genevieve scares me. ANDY: You know,
 it's kind of funny because I was someone with zero options on day three, but now,
 strategically, I feel like I'm in a very interesting place
in this game. She's-she's scary. -She's good. -ANDY: What I'm observing is a bit
 of a power shift. In early Gata,
when I was truly on the bottom, Sam had all the power over me. But this time, there's just a different
 dynamic right now. I'm like a slithering snake,
I feel like. I am in the middle, and
I'm whispering different things in people's ears. I would be very excited
to work with you, Kyle. Same with you. There's an expression I like. It's called "loyal to the soil." Once I'm loyal, it just goes all the way down
to the soil. Yeah, I like that. That's good. -Whatever I do...
-It's... Tonight... Yeah. ANDY:
Right now, I'm like a pendulum,
 swinging this way and swinging that way, and what I really try to do is play
people off each other because I'm in so many conversations
 right now. How do you feel about Genevieve? She's a silent assassin. And then she was also floating, "We have to look out
for Rachel." -Oh.
-Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I don't. I've been looking for an ally
in this game for a long time, and it's pretty ironic that it all comes back
 to going with Andy. I think we're all, like,
pretty safe right now. -We're all pretty safe. Yeah.
-In the grand scheme -of, like, threats.
-Yeah. RACHEL:
 We've had a rocky road,
 but I think Andy's kind of my guy right now. -Andy, we're doing it.
-We're doing it. This is fun. -We're playing Survivor. I know. I'm down. -(laughing)
-What's happening? I'm a smiling assassin. Like, I feel like
I have ice in my veins, but, you know,
people don't see that. People see the charming Andy, and that really is
my greatest strength. I've built a web
 of different alliances that no one really sees
the full picture except for me. And it's very sticky,
and everyone's caught up in it. And, you know, all I got
to do is crawl over here and decide, you know,
 who my next victim is, bite their head off
 and crawl over here and decide who my next victim is
 after that. I'm a lethal player

-Rachel sticks the first one for Blue. Here comes Kyle. They've got a big lead. There are three balls to land.
They have landed one. -Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: Kyle short. Now you got to wait
for that ball to roll back. Gabe is working very fast, trying to make up
a lot of time for Red. That's it. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Kyle in and out
with that second. Gabe is whipping through
this course. He could give Red a shot
at this. SAM:
Nice and easy, Kyle. -Oh.

with the second. -That's the right touch, buddy.
-Blue has only landed one ball. -Gabe is moving very fast.

Nobody got through this course
faster than Gabe. You are a good, Red! Untie him. Wow, what a comeback by Gabe. Yeah. Yeah! -Yes!
-Kyle lands the second. It would be a massive comeback
for Red. Here it is for Sam for the win. One ball left for Blue. Red trying to get in it. -And it won't matter.
-(Rachel and Kyle cheering) With one toss,
Sam sticks the third ball. That was insane. PROBST:
A valiant comeback effort
by Red. They will not get a shot.
This challenge is over. Wow. KYLE:
Oh, my God. Sam, Kyle, Rachel, you pulled it out. Nice job. Here's what's in store. You're gonna leave here

 I see the giant bowl of rice. Like, I mean, come on. In Survivor, you're supposed to eat rice. I haven't had any rice yet.
You know, I tried. I put it in my pocket,
but I didn't get any, so... Like, it's amazing
 to just feel nourished. Any fruits here -you've never had?
-SAM: Um, basically, -all of these.
-Oh, my God, Sam. -We're gonna do a taste test.

-That's kiwi. Okay, I haven't had kiwi. -Cheers.

-I'm bringing that cake up. -SAM: Do it.
-RACHEL: Oh, yeah,
I'm ready for cake. Oh, my God. That looks so good. SAM:
That looks amazing.
I needed this really bad. Feels like forever since
something's, like, gone my way. And been, like...
like, gotten, like, a win. So this... this is a big
pick-me-up, for sure. Yeah, it's tough. KYLE:
Yeah, I think that the script is gonna get flipped here
real soon. -You think?
-Well, I think it's pretty obvious
to many people that if there's somebody
to be weary of... Talking about Gabe? I'm thinking so. I know that it's just
a matter of time before, like, he strikes me
or I strike him. I love Gabe to death,
 but out here in the world where we have to play
 for a million dollars, it's every man
for himself right now. And with my reputation
 rapidly growing in this game
 as a physical competitor, it's kind of hard to trust in
the alliances you have because you never know when they're
gonna try to cut you short. I really, really am flexible
at this point. I'm just...
I'm looking for people. I'm looking for people.
Like, I don't want to just be strung along
for votes and stuff. KYLE:
 This is a prime opportunity
 for me right now. I need to be able to make a move on Gabe
before he makes a move on me. And Sam and Rachel
 are the perfect candidates to start stirring that pot. If-if we can orchestrate a move. I think people are sketched out
by Tuku a little bit right now. Well, then maybe it's time
for me to really jump ship. SAM:
 I would love, love, love
 to get Gabe out of this game. He's somebody who is
a massive strategic force. And it doesn't hurt that
 he was part of the reason why Sierra and I got split up. Get my revenge a little bit and
twist the knife while I'm at it. If Gabe wins, he's out
of the question completely. SAM:
If Gabe wins, what do we do? Because if Gabe wins, Kyle, -a lot of people are gonna want
to write your name down.
-Yeah. So then, do we
take Genevieve out next? SAM:
If we can't get Gabe,
that might be the move. Genevieve-- she definitely
has a mindset of, "This is a game
and I don't care who I have to burn."
But Gabe is not somebody who I think we can get later. Because if we don't get Gabe,
he's gonna get us. RACHEL:
 Clearly, these two boys-- Kyle and Sam-- want Gabe out. And I think a lot of people
in this game feel that way. But if I could vote
 anybody out next, I would like
 to vote out Genevieve. I think that she,
 out of everyone, is the most, like, onto me. And so, I think it's just me
 trying to figure out, is that my next best step? -Talk to me without Kyle here.
-Yeah. Is any of what you're saying
... for his sake? -No.
-Okay. Rachel, I want to play the game
with you. Like... Can you explain to me
a little, like... Okay, I do, too, and I... -I-I will air all my cards out
for you.
-I just feel like last night, I told you
not to blow my spot. You immediately went to Sol.
Like, those things aren't
helping me trust you. I get that. Here's the thing. To me, you're the only person that I owe loyalty to
in the game. And so, what I'm hoping is that we can get a Tuku out. -Right.
-And then, we can go after,
like, Genevieve, and we can start
knocking people out. Now I think there's more room for you and I
to actually play together. I agree. I agree. Sam and I were able to really
have it out during this reward, but I feel like
 every opportunity that I give Sam to not lie to me or screw me over in some way,
he still does. So, I'm open to hearing
 the plans. I want to know what they want to do, you know, at the next Tribal. But I'm also not sure
 if I'll actually go with them or not. ANDY: So, the way
 that I'm playing this game, I'm looking for opportunities to build bonds on all
different sides of the fence. And my next move, I want to go,
oh, across the aisle and build
a really good relationship with someone on Tuku. -Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.
-I'd love to hear
what your thoughts are, 'cause I think you're probably
a genius at this. -Sue, I've been thinking
very hard about it.
-Okay. -I think we could sit
at the end together.
-We could. I don't want to just
vote with you anymore. Like, I feel like I look at you,
I see, like, a partner. -Right.
-Like, in crime. -Yeah, absolutely.
-Like, a partner in this game. Like, I really want to work
really, really closely with you. Okay. So let's do it. -Let's absolutely do it.
-Okay. Sue is the exact player
that I want to have with me, because she plays
 this game with her emotions and how she feels about someone. And I know that
 when it comes to Kyle, there's sort of beef -with Sue.
-I want to kill him. That's why I don't even listen
when he talks. I'm like,
"I want to kill you, Kyle." -He is a liar.
-Yeah. He does the "poor me,"
the "woe is me." How many times do we have
to hear that he's poor? "I'm a good guy.
I'm a dad. I'm a this." He's so hypocritical. (bleep) done. The sooner Kyle is cut, the-the happier I'll be. I will give him back his name
on a parchment. He (bleep) wrote my name down. -Exactly.
-He didn't feel bad. Like, I can't even look at Kyle. I (bleep) hate him. Because he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. He wrote
my name down. He wrote my name down. 'Cause he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. So, Kyle-- he... He calls you and Caroline
Tweedledee and Tweedledum. -Really?
-He does, yeah. -Okay.
-I didn't think
that was very nice. No, not nice at all. "Tweedleydee" and "Tweedleydum."
Do you want to... I want to be like,
"(bleep) you, you (bleep)." I cannot wait
 to write that name down. -We need to get rid
of Kyle when we can.
-Yeah. TEENY:
Feel like it's a good three
to have gone together. I'm curious what
they're gonna talk about. -Me too.
-And I'm hoping
Rachel will tell us. -TEENY: I know.
-Yeah. CAROLINE:
I think she will. Obviously, they're pitching
one of us. It's not like they're pitching one
of each other. Yeah. I worry about Kyle sometimes
when it comes to me. GENEVIEVE:
When it comes to you? -Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: Oh, really? GABE:
I mean, we've just gotten, like, personally, pretty close over the past few days, and if there was
somebody who was gonna... ...be in position
to pull one over my eyes, I think it'd be Kyle. Nobody's beating Kyle.
It's just not happening. No.
I'm sorry to tell you all. If he is there,
I will vote for him. GABE: I'm starting
 to have to reconcile with the fact that Kyle might have to leave this game
earlier than I'd like him to. I-It's tough because,
 on a strategic level, I know how Kyle's gonna vote
every single vote. A-At least I think I do. And so, I'd like to keep that for as long as I can.
 But I have to weigh the benefits
of having Kyle in this game and the negatives of having
four Tukus that intimidate a lot of people.
 And of all four of 'em, Kyle's gonna
be the easiest sell. Yeah. I think you're right. -Hello, hello.
-Hello. We have returned. My game plan coming back
 to camp is I need to find whoever else is feeling like they're at the bottom
 and start to, one at a time, assemble an army. -There's some stuff
in the works. Like...
-Okay, cool. -Let me hear it.
-I would like to get Gabe. And if the five of us outcasts
form a little alliance, we have a little bit of power. I think I've established a little bit of trust, maybe, with Andy and Teeny
to potentially work together. I might burn 'em tomorrow. In fact, I probably will.
 So, they can't trust me,
but I want 'em to. There's a lot of people
that are really trying -to find footing in the game.
-Mm-hmm. Why don't we
find footing together? -Yeah.
-Like... Absolutely. I never thought I'd say it, but I'm interested
 in working with Sam. I think Sam kind of finds himself
in a similar position as me. He's lost somebody he's super
close to. He's been blindsided. And right now,
 I'm trying to latch on to anything that's available because it is beyond overdue
 for a vote to go my way. -Let's do it.
-I like that. I like it a lot. TEENY:
 But I don't want to be too trusting, because my attachments to people in this game have been a kryptonite for me. ANDY:
 This character started in -a book.
-The Grinch.
-That's the only good one. ANDY:
It's the Grinch! (cheering, whooping) -GENEVIEVE:
I really like that game.
-SAM: Yeah. TEENY:
 I am having a Survivor low. I feel like I am sort of in mourning of my relationship with Genevieve. Like, I feel like
what we went through was almost just, like,
 a breakup for us. Because I really wanted to play in lockstep with her.
 And realizing she doesn't view me like that in this game is... devastating. And it messes
 with my self-esteem, and it's really just throwing me
 for a loop. And I feel like a lot of it, what's coming out is, like, stuff with my identity
that I haven't fully sorted out. In my real world, I do distract myself
 by being with my friends and being super social
and feeling like I'm well-liked. And it takes away
 from the insecurities I feel in my own skin a lot of the time, and... Throughout my life, I've worked through
a lot of identity issues. I've discovered my sexuality,
I've come out of the closet. But I feel I've landed
at a place right now in my life where I don't know exactly how I fit in in a sort of
man-and-woman, binary world. I feel like
 I'm dealing with a lot of very personal
 inner-world issues and trying to mask them
 for the sake of my game. And it's getting harder because I'm losing people
 who I care about. And people who I thought
 I could trust, I can't trust anymore.
So I just feel really alone in processing myself
in this game and my place in this world
and who I am. TEENY:
 But then, all of a sudden, I see the entire side of my bag is just embers and flames. What the heck? TEENY:
 The bag that carries my life in this game
 and all of my items... ...now looks like this. I feel like
 this is just another cherry on top of the mess that
my game feels like right now. I've been kicked while I'm down,
 but it does light another fire under my ass to get this game moving
 in the direction I want it, and... I think it's a sign of a new life

-First things first, Gabe. Got to take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Now, yesterday, you squirmed like a worm for a shot at reward. Today you're gonna have
to be more sloth-like. Because today, you're
 gonna be balancing a ball on a wooden disc. At regular intervals,
 we'll add more balls, making it more difficult. While you're balancing
 those balls on the disc, you're gonna be balancing
 your entire body on a tiny little piece of wood. You know the drill.
 You fall off, ball drops, you're out. But if you outlast
everybody else, you win immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final eight. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the tenth person voted out and become
the third member of our jury. There's one more element
to today's challenge. It's been 18 days
without any rice. That can all change. -That's a bag of rice.
-Oh, my gosh. PROBST:
Enough to get you to the end. This is the rice negotiation. I need four people... ...to sit out
in exchange for rice. This is always a reflection
of where the game is, because on the surface, the easy deal is
four people agree to sit out. You agree,
"Tonight, we won't vote you out. We'll all have rice." That's not how Survivor works. No, it's never that easy, and, you know, it'd be great
if four people felt safe enough that they could sit out,
but I don't think that's where the game is
right now. I think everybody's still
very on edge and very much wanting that necklace
a little bit more than the rice. Is that true?
Anybody instantly say, "I'd consider sitting out
for rice"? Push it to three? No. The set price is four. What if two of us gave up
our Shots in the Dark? No. What if you got
all the Shots in the Dark? (laughs) All the Shots in the Dark? Every Shot in the Dark -down the line.
-Wow. Everybody here willing
to give up your Shot in the Dark on only day 18? -I would do that.
-I would do that. I don't have one. I would do it
if everyone else does it. -I-I...
-(laughing) PROBST:
I just want to make sure you're thinking clearly, because this is
a massive sacrifice from where I sit over here. The Shot in the Dark
is your last gasp, your Hail Mary,
your one last chance. GENEVIEVE:
I'll do it if everyone does. -I'll do it if everyone does it.
-Okay, I'm not gonna say no. -SAM: I'm thinking.
-What's that? -I'm thinking.
-PROBST: Sam, walk me through the reason
you're reluctant. Yeah, I mean, uh,
I'm on the bottom. I-I've been on the bottom, and it's easy for the people
on the top to say, "I don't need
my Shot in the Dark." But when you feel like that
might be your only other chance at surviving in this game,
that rice-- I can go eat rice
after I get voted out. Your vote is more powerful
than that Shot in the Dark. Your vote is how you get out
of the bottom-- by giving people your vote. I've been offering my vote. -Nobody's wanted to take it.
-And you're still here. They've been trying
to leave me out of the vote. You're still here
because you have a vote. And if you want to lean
on your challenge aptitude, that rice is gonna help it. If you feel like
you're on the bottom, that rice is more valuable
to win an immunity necklace then get a one-in-shot chance
at immunity. You reconsidering
or you locking in, Sam? I'm not... I'm not gonna
keep rice from the group. PROBST:
So, Gabe persuaded you? -Sure.
-PROBST: Okay.
-SUE: Thank you, Sam. -Thank you, Sam.
-PROBST: All right, let me just make sure I have this right. Everybody who has
a Shot in the Dark is prepared to give it to me right now? -Yes.
-Yes. I'll make that deal. -Okay.
-PROBST:
Get your Shot in the Darks. Be very interesting
to see if this comes back and have a little second guess -at some point.
-RACHEL: I don't have one, Jeff. -PROBST: Nice.
-Yeah, this worked out
really well for Rachel. -Sorry, guys.
-KYLE: Yeah, right? PROBST:
If you're all willing
to give it up, I'll take 'em. Can't believe I proposed
something that you were in on. I know. Survivor history here. Survivor history for sure. Thank you. All the Shot in the Darks in exchange for one bag of rice
waiting for you back at camp. Well done. All right. Let's get into this.
Made a little history. GABE: I got Sam
to give up his Shot in the Dark so that I can eat rice today. So now I know for a fact
 there's gonna be no "Hail Mary toss-up,
 this person's safe." It was a very good thing for me. All right, let's do it. I never saw
this negotiation coming. Every player gave up
their Shot in the Dark in exchange for a bag of rice. If you have clever ideas like

because you all agreed to give up your Shot in the Dark in exchange for rice. So, now immunity
is really important because you got nothing else other than some kind
of advantage or idol. Could have a big impact in these final days
of season 47. Here comes the wind. That will change everything. Instantly,
Caroline feels the impact. A little bit of a breeze. Another big gust of wind. Andy with a little movement.
Nice recovery. That ball wants to roll. Once it starts rolling,
it's hard to stop it. And the wind is gone. Once again, it is calm. You've got 15 seconds left
in this first stage, and then
we will add another ball. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Grab your ball.
Everybody's safe. You are good for a moment. Take a second.
Then we're gonna grab a second ball. All right, everybody
grab a second ball. It's gonna get
a little more difficult. I'll give everybody
a clean start and then we're back on. Everybody remove your hands. And this challenge is back on. We've got ten minutes
in this round. It just got a whole lot harder
with two balls. And if they start going
in opposite directions, it's even more difficult. -Man.
-PROBST: Caroline drops. She's first out.
Take a spot on the bench. No shot at immunity. Here comes the wind.
Andy can't navigate the wind. Andy is out.
We're down to seven. Just like that, less than a minute
into this round, we lose two players. That wind will come up
out of nowhere. Another big gust of wind
moving Sam's balls. Rachel teetering on disaster. Both balls at opposite ends
of the disc. Rachel can't navigate that. Rachel's out. We're down to six. PROBST:
Genevieve drops. She's out. We're down to five. Gabe drops.
We're down to four. This is it. A potentially
million-dollar game with a ball on a piece of wood. Ten seconds left in this round. Five, four, three, two, one. You are all good.
Grab your balls. Take a moment.
We'll move on -and add another ball.
-That was really well done. PROBST:
Well done. Everybody grab your third ball. This is gonna
be a lot more difficult. We're gonna place your hand
over the three balls. I'm gonna call you in
and we're gonna go. Here we go.
In three, two, one. Move your hand. This challenge is back on. -Teeny drops out of nowhere.
-Oh, Teeny. Teeny's out.
We're down to three. On one end, Kyle.
He's won it three times. On the other end, Sue.
She's won it once. In the middle, Sam.
He has not won it. And here comes the wind. Sue, for the first time in a long time,
with a little bit of movement. Kyle now has
a little bit of movement. Sam drops.
We have a showdown. Kyle versus Sue. Here comes the wind. Welcome to Survivor. Sue's balls are on the move. This is a battle. Now Kyle's balls
are starting to move. Sue again with movement,
and another nice recovery. PROBST:
Here comes more wind. Now Kyle's balls
are starting to move. Sue drops.
It's over. Kyle wins his fourth individual immunity. -Safe tonight at Tribal Council.
-Oh! Baby girl, baby boy. PROBST:
What a showdown between Kyle and Sue. -Wow!
-SUE: Good job, Kyle. GENEVIEVE:
That was so impressive. Thanks. Nice work, Kyle. -Thanks, Teeny.
-Good job, dude. -Damn, Kyle.
-Yeah. It just starts to hurt
after a little while. Yeah.
-KYLE: Thank you.
-TEENY: Yeah. Kyle, come on over. Good job, Kyle. PROBST:
Once again... -Yes, sir.
-immunity is yours. This is your fourth
individual immunity win. There are an elite group of players
who have won it five times. -KYLE: Geez.
-PROBST: What is that feeling? Nobody could really expect
to do this well, even though you dream
that it might happen. KYLE:
Growing up, I never really took first place seats
in anything. All I can say is that
I'm really proud of myself and I'm really proud of the people back home that give me the drive to want to hit a buck 20
every time I come out here. All right, well done, Kyle. You are safe tonight,
cannot be voted out, guaranteed a spot
in the final eight. As for the rest of you,
Tribal Council tonight, where somebody will be
the tenth person voted out and become the third member
of our jury. Grab your stuff,
head back to camp. I'll see you tonight
at Tribal Council. -Way to go. Congrats.
-Thank you, sir. Oh, boy. SUE:
 Getting that immunity necklace around my neck was so important
to me today because I've been trying
 to get Kyle out. So, Kyle big-time
 saved himself, but I can't cry over it. And now, unfortunately, we need to figure out
 the next target. Cr an be rr ie s. Cranberries right here? Beautiful and... How do you make sure your

That was fun. SAM:
Kyle, good job again, man. All right, let's get some food
in them bellies. Let's feed the family. SAM:
 I did not want to give up my Shot in the Dark for rice. I kind of know where I stand in the tribe. I know that my name is one that is frequently tossed around
as somebody who could go, SAM:
But I feel cautiously optimistic about my place in the game because I've started to sort of get the ball rolling on this alliance that I'm hoping can really take control
of the game. If we can get Gabe tonight,
that's great. Getting Gabe out tonight
puts the control in our hands. -SAM: I think so, too.
-And then we can decide. I feel like the margins
are really tight right now. -We need a Tuku out.
-SAM: No, I agree with you. SAM:
 Gabe is such a threat
 in this game because he is the leader
 of Tuku, and once you get Gabe, you kind of blow up
this Tuku alliance. I also think that Gabe would throw
Genevieve's name out there. I'm, like, it's so tempting for
me, because, like, I'm like... SAM:
Oh, I know. I want...
Dude, I want her out, too. TEENY: It is such a delicious option to think of Genevieve walking out
the door right now and knowing that she will not
 have the chance to pull something
 over on me again. And we just can't let her... -like, do her poison again.
-I know! But I know there's people
 on board to get Gabe out, so I know the timing
 is not right right now. I know we need
to get Gabe out first, and that's what I'm sticking to. She's playing everyone
really hard. -She scares me, dude.
-GABE: She got that Sol vote. I think she's got an adrenaline
kick from that Sol vote. -She's ready to keep it going.
-Exactly. GABE: Tonight, I want Genevieve
 out of the game. Genevieve put a huge target on her back when she made that Sol move. -She is smart. She is...
-GABE: That's what
I'm saying, dude. And she's been really down-low
this entire game. -Yeah.
-And then she emerged
for that Sol vote. -She's scary.
-But her problem:
she emerged too early. Right now, I feel the best I've ever felt in this game. Yeah. GABE:
 With nine people left
 in the game, we have four Tukus left: me, Kyle, Caroline and Sue. And we need five votes
 for a majority. We got the numbers, and as long as there's no funny business
 with idols or advantages, I'm making it to eight
with three other Tukus.
 And the fact that the fellow players around me
have allowed this to happen is mind-blowing. This is it. This is... On day three,
we ... dreamed of this. And it's going to be you, me
and Sue as the final three. CAROLINE:
 Gabe is a close
 alliance member of mine. CAROLINE: And while I love the honesty I have with Gabe
and I love our relationship... ...with the track record
 right now of the merge votes, he's played a better game
 than me. So, while Genevieve
 is a big threat, I'm starting to feel like
 if I vote out Gabe... ...it means that I can really start my game. This will get me in trouble.
Please, please, please -don't say anything about it.
-I won't. I won't. I'm getting quite worried
about Gabe. Our opportunities
to get him out are narrowing. -Yeah.
-And while Genevieve
is a threat right now... Yeah. So, I think
the numbers are there. I want to collaborate with you. And now that Kyle has won, Gabe is an even bigger target. I know. But you will? CAROLINE:
 Things are opening up now, but I'm still not entirely sure when is the best time
 to get out Gabe. Because targeting Gabe
 means targeting Sue and betraying her trust and potentially
 destroying our alliance. I actually think we're in
an incredibly good position. -Okay.
-Incredibly good position. CAROLINE:
 And my alliance with Sue is so important to me. So, I'm still
 figuring out exactly what the right move
to do is here, 'cause it could ruin me
 in this game. My only fear
about doing Gabe right now. Like, once Gabe's gone, who is everyone else
looking at now? Everybody is so hell-bent on cutting Gabe because
 he's just such a big threat. But I do think that Genevieve going before Gabe
 would be better for my game because everyone
will still have their eyes locked on Gabe after that, and no one will be looking
at little old Rachel. (laughs) And I think
Kyle would be on board to keep Gabe for, like,
another vote if we wanted. Interesting. RACHEL:
 And so, I would love to, like,
convince a player like Kyle to go after someone
 like Genevieve because if Gabe goes, he's next, full stop. So... do you want to vote Gabe or
do you want to vote Genevieve? The only reason why,
and in my gut, I feel like I shouldn't
vote Gabe, is because he's the only, like,
bigger threat than me. -That's what I feel like.
-Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm really nervous that if Gabe does go home, I'm going to become
public enemy number one. Right. I really struggled
 for, like, a while to get any footing,
 but I think that the position that I'm finally
in right now is the position that I always wanted to be in. -What would you rather do?
-I'd rather do Genevieve. I just want the votes
to go the way I want them to go. You know, I came
 into the game saying that, like, I don't want
to be the captain, I want to be the ocean. Like, I want to just, like, turn
the ship in a direction I want. I don't need to be
holding the steering wheel. But I'd prefer
 Genevieve goes home next. -CAROLINE: They'd be in here?
-GABE: Ooh! -Rice.
-KYLE: We're gonna eat, baby. -Rice. Oh, rice.
-KYLE: We're gonna eat. -A sack.
-Amazing. It's the best rice
I've ever had in my life. GENEVIEVE: Soon as I ate
 the rice, I was like, "I want
my Shot in the Dark back." Because now I'm worried. I am the most worried
 for myself. Coming off the Sol blindside and, like,
 the fallout with Teeny, like, I'm truly eating this rice
 around camp being like, "Last meal on the beach." Like... And it gets to you. Tonight, I have the least amount of confidence
I've had in the game. It's gonna be me
or Gabe tonight. -Right. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Well, I mean,
it's gonna be Gabe. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 People are telling me
 they agree on Gabe. Don't fully believe it, but I'm just really hoping
 people see Gabe as a bigger threat than me. What do you think's
gonna happen tonight? It's gonna be you or Genevieve. ... Sue and Caroline
aren't going me. They-they will not go me. Like, and all we can do is put
Genevieve's name down tonight. I've been the decoy for a lot of votes this season, but today,
 I have a lot of paranoia. I feel like
my threat level is sky-high. -Okay.
-And somebody-- I'm not saying you-- but somebody has my name
out there. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. GABE:
 I know that Genevieve wants it
to be me tonight. Everyone... It seems like
everyone is avoiding me and talking to you. No one is dying
to talk to me today, and maybe that's because -I'm not gonna be here tomorrow. -GABE: The two biggest targets -right now are you and me.
-(sighs) I have no idea where the alliances are. Like, our merged tribe
 is such a hodgepodge mess. There is the Tuku four, and then everybody else
 is just a random group of people who have
 lied to each other, been on the wrong side of votes, been on the right side of votes,
 and it's, like anybody's guess. GABE:
 If tonight's vote goes the way
 that we want it to and Genevieve is gone, this game is going to be
in the palm of my hand. GENEVIEVE:
 For me, this Tribal Council
 is about survival. If I can make it
through this one... And if I can get
through the night... ...the game will be wide open
tomorrow. I think I got it. >> W OM AN : Wh y di d we ch oo se S af el it e? We're always working

of our jury. (mouthing) All right. So, I want
to understand something. We've talked a lot this season
about this idea of community. Teeny, one thing
that was never clear to me is what is the criteria for being one of the people that gets asked
to be in the community? I think, in the beginning,
when it was someone like Rome, who was very
outwardly predictable, the criteria was more,
"just don't do that." Just don't be that extra
about everything that you're doing in this game. And with Sierra and Sol gone,
I feel like a lot of plans were made for each person. After Sierra,
we'll do this person. After Sol, we'll do this person. But what I'm noticing is there's not a lot
of consistency in that. So, I'm about just
as confused as you are in terms of
what the criteria is. Sam, is the idea of community ebbing and flowing or are you trying to conform? I don't think
it's ebbing and flowing. I just think we're getting
to the point in the game where people's criteria
of their community is different
from everybody else's. Like, the criteria is shifting depending on who you ask. And I think that's kind of why we each have our own plan for
how we want the game to unfold. PROBST:
Gabe, what I'm hearing
tonight is, "Well, we decide, but none of us really agree.
It shifts every day." GABE:
Well, Survivor is a game that you build a community that is
destined to be torn apart. You put work
into building a community, and then you have to put in maybe more work
into tearing it apart. It's a hard thing to do. Let's talk about
today's rice negotiation. Because, on one hand, I was
impressed that you came up with an offer that I thought was so good I couldn't pass it up. But what I'm struck by, Andy, is that in agreeing to give up
all of your Shots in the Dark, you all agreed to make it easier to vote every single person
out of this game. ANDY:
Yeah, the Shot in the Dark is most useful
to disrupt what would otherwise be an easy vote. -Exactly.
-And that was very symbolic in terms
of we all agreed on how we're going to -sort of play the rest
of this game.
-PROBST: Sam, I'm curious about what
Andy said. "We all agreed." -That's not what I saw.
-(soft laughter) -Yeah.
-PROBST: And I'm hearing laughs.
-Eventually. -Eventually,
-PROBST: I felt like Gabe certainly was persuading or cajoling, even you, into doing this, but maybe
that was just my observation. Yeah. I mean,
it's no secret that I wasn't fully on board with giving up
my Shot in the Dark. I think it all depends on, like,
your position within the game. And ultimately,
what it came down to me was, like,
this is still a community, and it's still a social game. It's not worth taking rice away from eight other people
that I'm living with. There are just hills
that aren't worth dying on. PROBST:
Teeny, it was
a little bit, though, on theme in that it was about
conformity to the community. There was one person who said,
"I don't know." And everybody else said, "What
do you mean you don't know? We're gonna do this."
So Sam said, -"Okay."
-TEENY: Yeah. Absolutely. It all goes back
to adaptability. Like, you know,
Sam advocating for the fact that he wanted
his Shot in the Dark could have the exact
opposite effect than he wanted in trying to keep himself safe, and actually puts a target
on his back because he's fighting for the one thing
the rest of us agree on. But it kind of just opens up
the battlefield a bit more. PROBST:
Gabe, what's the criteria right now for tonight's vote? GABE:
I think people are starting
to think about who they want to sit
at the end with. I think beforehand, it was, "Let's build the community
we want," and then it was, "Let's get rid
of some chaotic characters." And now it's, "Let's figure out who I want to sit with
at the end." PROBST:
What do you think it is, Sam? What's the criteria
for this group in terms of who you want to get rid of
and who you want -to go deeper?
-SAM: Yeah. I mean, right now, I don't know if there's really a clear line
of, like, "Oh, these are the people that
I can take to the end and beat." And I think that's going to be what decides what happens tonight
and probably what happens moving forward. Rachel, agree with that,
that we are looking for the biggest target,
and like any good player, we got to take 'em out
when we can? RACHEL:
I mean, I don't think that Sierra and Sol
would be sitting over there if we were voting out the
weakest people on this tribe. So, yeah, obviously, people are
looking to vote out people that they're scared of. Andy, if you're voting out
the people who are the biggest threats, then you got to decide on
what's the criteria for what is -the biggest threat tonight.
-That's the big question. I feel like, yeah, the mentality on this tribe right now is we're going threat-hunting. You know, everyone is looking for who they want to sit with
at the end, but I think that people want to defeat the big threats here on the
battlefield of Tribal Council before the Final Tribal Council. PROBST:
Caroline, do you
agree with that? CAROLINE:
Absolutely. There's a lot of different ways
to view threats. Sometimes a threat
is just someone who doesn't want
to work with you. Sometimes a threat is the person
who will prevent you from getting
to be where you want to be and could throw out
my position in the community. For me, I find that
to be a huge threat, and that's personally what I am
thinking about a lot right now. PROBST:
Genevieve, do you
get that sense, as the day is unfolding,
that you can tell when something's
just a little off? GENEVIEVE:
Yeah. I'm not sure if it was information
or misinformation, but, like, people who were
talking to me yesterday were talking to me less today and then reassuring me. And that's where you just
check in with your people and hope that they would
give you an honest heads up if your name was out there.
But yeah, I missed my
Shot in the Dark this afternoon. So you're really
second-guessing that. Yeah, but I'm always paranoid. And now I think I just feel,
like, a little less confident without it.
I didn't realize what I had until it was gone. -Sam, what'd you sense today?
-SAM: Today was the first day that I think
I started to feel like part of the community again. And so, it made me feel good. But the last time I felt good,
I felt really, really bad -immediately after.
-Oh.
-TEENY: Yeah. Gabe, why are you laughing?
What is it about that that is so enjoyable
to hear or relate to? It just sums up
the game so well, in so few words, of, you can feel
really, really good, and then feel really, really bad
immediately after. But then there's the flip side
of it, too, where you can feel really, really bad, and then
something just happened, and you feel
really, really good again. I mean, we're getting
to the point where those emotional swings are just so intense sometimes, and it's tough to deal with.
It really is. All right, it is time to vote. Sue, you're up. If you play an idol, I'm toast. Even if you don't play an idol,
 I might be toast. So it's been a crappy day. (blows raspberry) You're the biggest threat
out here, and we would be fools to not do this while we can. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Gabe. Genevieve. -One vote Genevieve.
-Crap. Genevieve.
That's two votes Genevieve. Gabe.
We're tied. Two votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve. Gabe. That's three votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve. Gabe. That's four votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve. Tenth person voted out
and the third member of our jury: Gabe. That's five.
That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. -Good game, everybody.
-Good game, bud. -Good game, Gabe.
-Good game, Gabe. Gabe, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Oh. Grab your torches.
