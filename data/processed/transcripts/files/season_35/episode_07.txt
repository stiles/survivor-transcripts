         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE YAWA TRIBE,
THREE HEALERS, ONE HERO, AND A
HUSTLER REMAINED UNDEFEATED.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 Jeff: AT THE LEVU TRIBE,
JOE'S GAME WAS LOOKING UP.
 HELLO, BABY.
OH, MAN.
 Jeff: AT THE SOKO TRIBE,
J.P. AND ALI WERE ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
 RYAN AND I NEED TO MAKE THE
DECISION ON WHICH OF THE TWO
GOES HOME TONIGHT.








 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CHRISSY AND RYAN SENT ALI HOME.
ALI, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
12 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 I DIDN'T WANT THE SMILE WHEN
SHE LEFT BECAUSE IT WAS SO SAD
SHE WAS LEAVING AND I WAS SO
SORRY FOR HER, AND I WAS SO
HAPPY FOR US AND I WAS TRYING
NOT TO SMILE.
 SHE HAD TO GO.
 I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME
24 HOURS A DAY.
I THINK I AM DOMINATING THE
SOCIAL GAME ON THIS TRIBE, AND
BOTH GUYS ARE CLOSER WITH ME
THAN THEY ARE EACH OTHER.
WOW, WE MADE ONE MORE.
WE MADE TOP TWO-THIRDS.
THAT LEAVES ME IN A VERY NICE
POSITION ON THIS TRIBE,








POTENTIALLY THE POWER POSITION.
I THINK WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW IS
SETTING ME UP FOR A NICE FUTURE
RUN.
 IF IT'S A CHALLENGE TODAY,
WE'RE WINNING, GUYS.
 I FEEL REALLY GOOD WITH MY
FIVE HERE IN YAWA.
WE TRUST EACH OTHER IMPLICITLY
NOW.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH HARD THINGS
TOGETHER.
BEN IS A GOOD GUY.
LAUREN, I THINK SHE'S GOING TO
STICK WITH US.
ME, MIKE, AND JESSICA, WE'RE
THREE HEALERS.
WE HAVE THAT BOND CARRYING OVER
FROM THE LAST TRIBE SOME IF THIS
GROUP JUST STAYS TOGETHER, WE
CAN ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH, AND I
DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE WILL
HAVE THAT SAME UNITY.
I DON'T SEE THE OTHER TEAMS
STAYING STRONG TOGETHER.
 RIGHT.
 SO WE HAVE FIVE PEOPLE.
I FEEL LIKE COME MERGE, WE CAN
PROBABLY DRAW IN JOE AND DESI.
 WE ALL HAVE TO HAVE A SOLID
PACT.
 WE HAVE TO MAKE A PLAN.
WE HAVE TO EXECUTE IT.
AND WE HAVE TO STICK TO IT.
IF WE GO INTO A MERGE,
GUNS-ABLAZING, FIVE STRONG,
WE'LL DO ALL RIGHT, BUT MY
BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS
COLE.
COLE AND JESS SIT DOWN THERE AND
PLAY PATTY-CAKE ALL NIGHT LONG.
IT'S JUST HARD TO TRUST THAT.
IT'S JUST HARD TO TRUST THAT.
 THINGS HAVE TO GET BETTER.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE A BROKEN TRIBE.
IT'S TWO VERSUS TWO, DEVON AND I
AGAINST JOE AND DESI.
BUT ON TOP OF ALL, THAT
PHYSICALLY WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT.
OUR STOMACHS ARE EMPTY, AND YOU
CAN FEEL THAT.
WE ARE OUT OF ALL FOOD.
WE HAVE NO RICE LEFT.
WE HAVE NO CHICKEN LEFT, NO
FRUITS, NO VEGETABLES.
WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT.
 I'M SO HUNGRY.
EXCEPT A LITTLE TINY BIT OF
SUGAR.
 SUGAR FOR BREAKFAST.
 "SURVIVOR" IS NO JOKE.
WE'RE NOT JOKING IF WE SAY IF WE
DON'T GET FOOD TODAY WE MIGHT
DIE.
HE'S BARELY MOVING.
 UH-HUH.
 YOU CAN DO IT, TV -- DE VE.
 I'M RUNNING ON EMPTY.
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CALORIE IN
MY BODY THAT'S USABLE.
MY BRAIN FEELS DEAD AND EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF MY LIMBS FEELS
LIKE IT WEIGHS 1,000 POUNDS.
 THIS IS THE SADDEST POINT IN
MY LIFE RIGHT HERE.
THIS GAME IS A LOT MORE REAL
THAN I THOUGHT, AND GOING INTO
THE NEXT REWARD CHALLENGE, IF I
DON'T GET THIS WIN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
WOW, DESI, YOU ARE DRAGGING.
YAWA, LEVU, GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW SOKO TRIBE.
ALI VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
DESI, WATCHING YOU JUST WALK UP
THIS LITTLE FIVE-FOOT INCLINE OF
SAND, IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE
TRUDGING EVEREST.
IS THAT RALLY INDICATIVE OF THE
WEAR AND TEAR 17 DAYS IN?
 ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO EAT
AT OUR CAMP, LIKE NOT A SINGLE
CALORIE.
I JUST WANT SOME FD.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
 I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME
BOAT.
WE'RE ALL TIRED.
WE'RE ALL HUNGRY.
SO LET'S GET TO GETTING, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, EVERYBODY
DROP YOUR BUFFS.
YOU ARE MERGED.
[CHEERING]
 THIS IS THE GREATEST FEELING
EVER, BECAUSE YOU WANT THE -- TO
MAKE THE MERGE BECAUSE THEN
"SURVIVOR" STARTS.
 I'M MIKE.
 WHAT'S UP, MIKE?
 THAT'S WHEN YOU START FINDING
YOUR TRUE ALLIANCE, BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO BE ON THE YOUR GAME.
THE MERGE IS FIRST STEP TO GET
TO THAT $1 MILLION.
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 I REALLY HOPE THIS MEANS
FOOD.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.
 NEW BUFFS.
 PURPLE.
 HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SO MUCH
LOVE AT A MERGE?
 Jeff: THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.
I LIKE IT.
 IT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS WHEN
JEFF SAYS, "DROP YOUR BUFFS."
I THINK I'M IN A GOOD SPOT.
I HAVE MORE NUMBERS WITH THE
HEALERS.
THE HEALERS ARE FIVE.
THERE'S ONLY FOUR HEROES AND
THREE HUSTLERS.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, NOBODY NOSE
ABOUT THE IMMUNITY IDOL I HAVE.
RIGHT NOW I'M EXCITED.
 WHERE'S THE FOOD?
 THAT'S THE SCARY PART OF
THIS.
 THERE'S A CATCH.
 Jeff: SO DR. MIKE,
IMMEDIATELY EVERYBODY STARTED
SAYING, WHAT ABOUT THE FEAST AND
WHAT'S THE CATCH?
WHAT IS THE FEELING RIGHT NOW?
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT MAYBE
SOMETHING ISN'T GOING TO GO THE
WAY IT USUALLY GOES?
 SEASON 35 OF "SURVIVOR."
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
 Jeff: YOU'RE RIGHT, AND
TYPICALLY --
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WHEN YOU MERGE, YOU
ARE REWARDED WITH A BIG
BIG "SURVIVOR"-STYLE FEAST.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE
TODAY.
 DON'T SAY THAT.
 Jeff: BECAUSE WE GOT
SOMETHING BETTER.
 OH, NO WAY.
 WHAT YOU GOT?
WHAT YOU GOT?
 Jeff: WE BROUGHT OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE TO FIJI.
 GIVE ME THAT STEAK.
GIVE ME THAT STEAK.
 Jeff: YES, THE STEAK
AUTHORITY WILL BE IN CHARGE OF
THE MERGE FEAST, AND BECAUSE
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE LIVES BY
AUSSIE RULES, WHICH ARE NO
RULES, JUST RIGHT, YOUR BONE IN,
NATURAL CUT, BEEF
 RIBEYE, RIBEYE!
 Jeff: YOU LIKE THE RIBEYE?
 YEAH, THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
 Jeff: WELL, IT WILL BE MADE
TO ORDER, COOKED JUST HOW YOU
LIKE IT INDIVIDUALLY, PLUS BAKED
POTATO WITH ALL THE FIXINGS,
SALAD.
WHERE'S THE LAVA CAKE?
 Jeff: THE AUTHENTIC
CHOCOLATE THUNDER FROM DOWN
UNDER.
 ALCOHOL?
 Jeff: PLUS COLD BEER AND
GOLD COAST RITA.
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE IS WAITING
FOR YOU JUST AROUND THE CORNER.
ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.
 I NEEDED THIS MERGE SO BADLY.
MY TRIBE WAS A COMPLETE
DISASTER.
THERE'S ONLY THREE OF US LEFT.
MAKING THE MERGE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU DREAM OF.
THIS IS THE PLAYOFFS NOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
 BONE-IN RIBEYE.
 I'M HAVING EVERYTHING.
 WELCOME TO THE OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE.
 THANK YOU.
 GRAB YOURSELF A DRINK.
 OH, MY GOD.
I AM IN JUST PERFECT BLISS RIGHT
NOW.
 TO THE MERGE.
[CHEERING]
 TO MAKE THE MERGE IS SUCH AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT, AND TO GO FROM
SUCH A LOW THIS MORNING TO BEING
WITH ALL THESE AMAZING PEOPLE
AND THEN TO GO TO EAT THIS
OUTBACK FEAST WITH SUCH
HAPPINESS, I FEEL LIKE A KING,
MAN.
THIS IS THE LIFE.
 GIVE ME EVERYTHING.
 HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR
RIBEYE COOKED IN
 CAN I GET TWO STEAKS?
 YEAH, YOU CAN GET TWO STEAKS.
 TWO STEAKS.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 I USUALLY EAT ON A REGULAR
DAY 8,000 CALORIES, SO BEFORE
THE MERGE, I WAS JUST IN
SURVIVAL MODE.
I LIKE I JUST WANT FOOD, AND NOW
AFTER ALMOST THREE WEEKS OF
STARVING, WE HAVE OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE.
[CHEERING]
 WOW.
 THE STEAK JUST FALLS OFF THE
BONE AND MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.
IT FEELS LIKE IT'S STRAIGHT OUT.
A DREAM.
 OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S SO GOOD.
 BEST STEAK I EVER HAD.
 AMAZING.
 THANK YOU, OUTBACK
STEAKHOUSE.
 IF "SURVIVOR" IS A MOUNTAIN,
I FEEL LIKE HALFWAY.
THAT'S HOW YOU CONQUER A
MOUNTAIN, ONE STEP AT A TIME.
 COLE, I DON'T WANT YOU TO
FAINT.
YOU HAVE TO ORDER MORE.
 YOU CAN ORDER MORE?
 I ORDERED THREE STEAKS.
 THE IS THE FIRST TIME I GET
TO MEET JOE.
I'M SO GLAD I SPENT ALL THIS
TIME WITHOUT JOE.
HE'S LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS.
 TELL US ABOUT THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.
I HAD TO PULL AN ADOLL OUT, MAN.
 YOU HAD AN IDOL FROM WHERE,
BLUE OR YELLOW?
 YELLOW.
 YOU'RE THE FIRST ONES TO
KNOW.
 HOLY COW.
 JOE TELLS US THERE WAS AN
IDOL.
THE QUESTION IS, DOES JOE HAVE A
SECOND IDOL THAT HE DUG UP AT
LEVU?
 CHOCOLATE THUNDER FROM DOWN
UNDER.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I THINK THAT I LOVE YOU.
THIS AUSSIE WAITER, HE BRINGS ME
A THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER, AND
I'M LIKE, I LOVE YOUR THUNDER
FROM DOWN UNDER, AND THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING THAT TYPICALLY COMES
OUT OF MY MOUTH.
BEING A VIRGIN, I TRY THE STAY
MORAL AND HOLY.
ASIDE FROM THE JOY ABOUT THE
OUTBACK STEAKS, THE GOAL KICKS
BACK IN.
THE GOAL GOING TO THE MERGE WAS
TO REMAIN YAWA FIVE TO THE
END -- ME, LAUREN, MIKE, COLE,
AND BEN, BUT WE NEED TO BRING IN
AT LEAST TWO MORE PEOPLE TO MAKE
THE MAJORITY.
I THINK WE CAN GET TO THE OLD
HEALERS, JOE AND DESI.
SO WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS.
AS LONG AS NO ONE TRIES TO BREAK
AWAY FROM THE ALLIANCE, WE'LL BE
GOOD.
 SO GOOD.
TO THE MERGE, MAN.
 I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.
 I KNOW.
I WAS WORRIED.
 THE ONLY ONE I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT IS JOE.
JOE WENT THE LEVU AND DUG UP A
SECOND IDOL.
 YEAH, THEY'RE LISTENING RIGHT
NOW.
 BEFORE THE TRIBE SWAP,
CHRISSY AND I WERE PRETTY TIGHT,
BUT NO ONE KNOWS WE WERE WORKING
TOGETHER.
AND SHE'S WANTING TO TALK IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE, AND THAT'S
KIND OF CONCERNING, BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT US TWO TO BE
CONSIDERED A TIGHT ALLIANCE.
 WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET BACK
TO CAMP.
 SECRETLY.
 NEW THAT WE HIT THE MERGE,
EVERYBODY'S STARTING FROM
SCRATCH.
YOU HAVE TO ANTICIPATE.
THERE'S IN TEAMS NOW.
IT'S ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY, SO
MOVING FORWARD, THERE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ALL THIS
CAMARADERIE.
IT'S GOING TO BLIND SIDES, LIES,
AND I'M SURE SOMEONE IS GOING TO
CRY.
 LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
THIS IS LIKE A NEW WORLD.
 THIS WAS INCREDIBLE.
 THE GOAL WAS TO GET TO THE
MERGE.
NOW FIRST STEP BACK INTO CAMP,
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
NEW LIFE.
WE HAVE HAMPERS NOW, MULTIPLE
MACHETES.
WE EVEN HAVE THESE MASSIVE MAILS
SO WE CAN BUILD A GREAT SHELTER.
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT FOR
THEMSELVES, SO THE THOUGHT
CROSSED MY MIND THAT I SHOULD BE
LOOKING FOR A CLUE OR SOME KIND
OF ADVANTAGE.
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING,
BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO KEEP
ACTIVELY LOOKING, JUST BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WITH
OTHER PEOPLE NOW, TALKING A LOT,
PLOTTING AND STRALT JIEZING,
TRYING TO BUILD NEW ALLIANCES.
 HAS JOE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
US WORKING TOGETHER?
 YEAH, HE'S GOOD.
 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
 I THINK WE KEEP HIM AROUND AS
LONG AS WE NEED HIM.
 I SPOKE WITH DESI, AND I WAS
PLEASED TO HEAR THAT HER AND JOE
WERE STILL WORKING TOGETHER, SO
NOW I HAVE ALL OF THE OLD
HEALERS AND LAUREN AND BEN FROM
YAWA.
THAT'S THE MAJORITY.
I AM FEELING LIKE A QUEEN BEE AT
THIS MOMENT.
 HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
I WAS NERVOUS THE LAST ONE.
 I WAS NERVOUS.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO TALK WITH
DEVON SINCE WE HAD SWAPPED.
IT'S LIKE TWO OLD FRIENDS COMING
TOGETHER.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT BEING
ME, YOU, J.P., ASHLEY.
 SO YOU'RE TIGHT AT J.P.?
 YEAH, WE VOTED TOGETHER BOTH
TIMES.
SO ME, YOU, LAUREN...
 SO THAT'S US WITH THE HEROES.
 YEAH.
A HERO-HUSTLER ALLIANCE MAKES
SENSE FOR US BECAUSE
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S ONLY THREE
HUSTLERS LEFT, ME, LAUREN, AND
DEVON.
BUT I KNOW I'M TIGHT WITH TWO OF
THE HEROES, J.P. AND CHRISSY, SO
IT WOULD BE A PERFECT ALLIANCE,
THE LIKE THE HUSTLERS AND HEROES
VERSUS THE HEALERS.
 I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
 THE MERGE VOTE IS THE CREAM
OF THE CROP OF "SURVIVOR."
THIS DECIDES WHO IS GOING TO
DICTATE THE REST OF THE GAME.
AND A HUSTLER DOESN'T WAIT.
A HUSTLER GOES AND MAKES
ALLIANCES.
 WE ALL DO SO WELL IN THE
CHALLENGES.
 OH, MY GOSH, LIKE RUNNING ON
NOTHING.
 YEAH.
RIGHT NOW, LOOKING AT THE 12 WE,
HAVE I THINK STRONGEST PEOPLE
TRULY MADE IT TO THE MERGE.
BUT THE HEALERS AND THE HEROES,
THEY'VE SEEN EACH OTHER AS
THREATS THIS WHOLE GAME.
 WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT, JUST TO
LET YOU KNOW.
AND US HUSTLERS, WE'VE BEEN
FLOWING UNDER THE RADAR, WHICH
IN THE MERGE ISN'T A BAD SPOT TO
BE IN.
 WE WENT OFF ON OUR OWN, BUT I
THINK IT WORKED OUT BEST.
WE'RE IN THE MINORITY, BUT
EVERYONE WILL WANT US.
TALK TO PEOPLE, BUT DON'T GIVE
THEM ANY IDEA WHAT WE'RE DOING.
I'VE CONNECTED WITH EVERYONE.
I SAY WE GO WITH THE HEROES.
I SAY US SEVEN TAKE OUT THE
FIVE.
 THE HEROES AND THE HUSTLERS
WANT THE HEALERS GONE.
I REALLY LIKE DR. MIKE.
I MADE A PACK WITH THE LAST YAWA
TRIBE.
IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR FIVE OF
US TO STAY STRONG.
 THE PLAN IS FOR ME, HIM AND
RYAN AND WHOEVER ELSE TO TAKE
OUT THE HEALERS TOM ME THAT'S
NOT GOOD.
 1,000% TOGETHER.
I SWEAR.
 ON OUR CHILDREN?
 UH-HUH.
 LAUREN TELLS ME IMMEDIATELY
THAT DEVON WANTS TO GET OUT ALL
THE FORMER HEALERS.
 I MADE A VOW TO YOU, MIKE.
 I AM CONCERNED THAT THE
HEALERS CAN BE GANGED UP ON BY
THE ORIGINAL HUSTLERS AND HERO,
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE'RE
STILL FIVE HEALERS STRONG, PLUS
I'M STRONG WITH LAUREN AND I'M
STRONG WITH BEN.
SO THE LINES ARE BEING DRAWN IN
THE SAND, AND I EXPECT A WAR.
 I SEE THREE HUSTLERS, FOUR
HEROES TAKING OUT THE HEALERS.
MY EYES, MY BEST-CASE SCENARIO
IS TO TAKE OUT EITHER COLE OR
JOE, NO PROBLEM.
 ALL I KNOW IS I COULD BARELY
TAKE A WHOLE LUNCH WITH HIM.
 YEAH.
JOE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME,
WHICH MAKES HIM A THREAT TO
OTHERS, AND COLE IS A PHYSICAL
THREAT, AND IF HE DOES END UP
LOSING THE FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, IT WOULD BE A GOOD
TIME FOR HIM TO GO.
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO
GET THE SEVEN OF US.
 SO RIGHT NOW I'M LISTENING TO
EVERYONE, AND I COULD GO ONE WAY
WITH OLD HEROES AND OLD
HUSTLERS.
 LET'S PICK UP SOME WOOD WHILE
WE'RE GOING BACK SO IT LOOKS
LIKE WE'RE...
 OKAY.
 SEE IF WE COULD GET THAT YAWA
FIVE WORKING.
THE QUESTION IS CAN I TRUST
COLE?
 HOW WOULD YOU EVEN USE THIS
CINNAMON?
IT'S KIND OF GOOD IF YOU JUST
BITE IT.
 HE'S SELFISH, AND I DON'T
THINK COLE RESPECTS ANYONE HERE.
HE JUST RESPECTS HIMSELF.
YOU NEED HELP TO GET TO THE END,
PERIOD.
RIGHT NOW I NEED SOMEONE THAT I
CAN TRUST.
COLE IS UP THERE EATING FRICKING
CINNAMON STICKS.
 WHAT?
 YEP.
 COLE HAS MADE SOME BIG
MISTAKES, ESPECIALLY WITH FOOD.
HE JUST DOESN'T THINK.
AND HE GOES OFF BY HIMSELF.
HE DOESN'T TALK TO THE GROUP.
HE'S FOOD ALONE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN "SURVIVOR."
BUT COLE IS MY NUMBER ONE, AND I
JUST FEEL A CONNECTION WITH HIM.
WE HAVE BUILT A GREAT THING
TOGETHER, AND I NEED HIM HERE.
SO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER
CHAT.
 DON'T DO IT.
 OKAY.
DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING?
 YEAH.
 WHO?
 BEN.
 BEN?
 DEVON IS ON BOARD WITH VOTING
COLE OR JOE.
SO I MEAN...
 I FEEL LIKE VOTING COLE
DESTROYS THE ENTIRE TRUST IN OUR
ALLIANCE OF FIVE.
 THE YAWA TRIBE WENT IN SAYING
WE WERE FIVE STRONG.
THE PROBLEM IS NOW BEN IS
WAVERING.
 IT WAS JUST THEORIZING,
NOTHING SET IN STONE, BUT COLE
IS THE BIGGEST THREAT.
 LET'S WORRY ABOUT IT ONE VOLT
AT A TIME.
BECAUSE COLE RIGHT NOW IS IN
YOUR FIVE.
POST-MERGE DYNAMICS ARE NOTHING
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.
I IMAGINED I'M THE ONLY PERSON
PLAYING THIS GAME, BUT IT ENDS
UP THAT EVERYBODY IS PLAYING THE
GAME.
THAT MAKES MY LIFE SO MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT.
EVERYTHING WE'VE WORKED ON IN
THE LAST NINE DAYS GOES OUT THE
WINDOW IF WE VOTE HIM OUT FIRST.
 JUST BECAUSE I WENT IN HERE
WITH A SUPPOSED ALLIANCE OF FIVE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY IS
STICKING TO THE ALLIANCE OF
FIVE.
 EVERYBODY'S GUNNING FOR YOU.
IT'S EITHER YOU OR JOE.
HUSTLERS ARE GUNNING FOR THE TWO
OF YOU GUYS.
 YOU STILL HAVE ME?
 OF COURSE.
 YOU'RE STILL WITH ME, RIGHT?
 100%.
 TO HAVE MY NAME ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK, I'M EXPERIENCING
THAT "SURVIVOR" PARANOIA, BUT
LIKE IN ROCK CLIMBING WHEN YOUR
GEAR PULLS, YOU'RE ALL THE WAY
ON THE TOP, AND NOW YOU'RE ON
THE BOTTOM.
MY ALLIANCES ARE MY GEAR.
I JUST PRAY THAT'S GOING TO KEEP
MY LIFE IN "SURVIVOR" GOING.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
DESI, MIKE, I'LL TAKE BACK THE
IDOLS.
THANK YOU.
TRIBAL IMMUNITY NO MORE.
THIS IS WHAT YOU COVET IN THE
GAME NOW.
THE INDIVIDUAL IMMONTI NECKLACE.
WITH THIS YOU ARE SAFE.
WITHOUT IT YOU ARE NOT.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STAND ON A NARROW BEAM
WHILE SPINNING A BALL INSIDE A
CIRCULAR WOODEN TRACK.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU'LL MOVE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM, MAKING IT
MORE DIFFICULT.
IF YOUR BALL DROPS OR YOU STEP
OFF, YOU'RE OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
LOSER, SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
ALL RIGHT.
PICK YOUR SPOTS.
HERE WE GO.
EVERYBODY START SPINNING YOUR
BALL.
EVERYBODY IS SPINNING.
AN YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IS ON.
AND JUST LIKE THAT RYAN IS OUT
ONLY SECONDS IN.
RYAN, TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THIS GAME
CAN GET YOU.
THAT HYPNOTIC TRANSTHAT'S GOING
TO BEGIN TO GET INSIDE YOUR
MIND, THAT BALL SPINNING.
DON'T LET IT LULL YOU INTO
FORGETTING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU'RE GOING THE MAKE YOUR FIRST
MOVE NOW.
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ONE FOOT ON
THAT BEAM.
NOW THINGS GET JUST A LITTLE
MORE DIFFICULT.
IT'S A TRICKY CHALLENGE.
YOU HAVE PROBABLY NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE.
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THIS ON A
SUNDAY IN THEIR BACKYARD?
 NOT EVEN ME, JEFF.
 Jeff: DR. MIKE DROPS.
MIKE IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.
WE ARE DOWN TO TEN.
BRAND-NEW SURVIVOR CHALLENGE.
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST PERSON TO
WIN IT, AND YOU WILL BE THE
FIRST PERSON SAFE AT TRIBAL
SINCE THE MERGE.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE ONE STEP
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM.
NOW BALANCE BECOMES JUST A
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.
AND WITH THAT JESSICA DROPS, AND
WE ARE DOWN TO NINE PEOPLE LEFT.
SWEAT POURING OFF OF JOE'S FACE.
 YES, SIR, YES, SIR.
 Jeff: CAN'T STOP TO WIPE
THAT SWEAT OFF.
 NO, SIR, NO, SIR.
 Jeff: YOU CANNOT GET LOST
IN THE MOMENTUM.
THAT SAME MOMENTUM THAT YOU NEED
IN THIS GAME IS WHAT YOU NEED IN
THIS CHALLENGE.
KEEP THAT BALL MOVING.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE A LITTLE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM.
YOU'RE NOW GOING TO PUT ONE FOOT
IN THE MOST NARROW SECTION.
DO IT IN LITTLE INCREMENTS.
BEN STRUGGLING.
BEN CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSFER.
BEN IS OUT.
J.P. DROPS.
HE'S OUT.
DEVON IS OUT, AND WE ARE DOWN TO
SIX.
LAUREN DROPS RIGHT BEHIND DEVON.
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
THIS THIRD SECTION GETTING A LOT
OF PEOPLE.
COLE WITH A NICE RECOVERY.
YOU CAN'T GET LULLED IN BY THAT
SOUND.
IT WANTS TO SEDUCE YOU INTO
FALLING ASLEEP.
JOE DROPS.
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
DESI, COLE, CHRISSY, ASHLEY.
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.
YOU GOT TO FIND WHATEVER IT IS
IN THAT TANK, HANG IN THERE.
YOUR ODDS ARE INCREASING WITH
EVERY ROTATION THAT YOU WILL BE
THE ONE THAT WINS THIS
CHALLENGE.
THE ONE THAT WINS THIS
CHALLENGE.
COLE FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS.
COLE DROPS.
HE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
NO SOONER SAID, CHRISSY DROPS,
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.
IT IS DESI AND ASHLEY FIGHTING
FOR IMMUNITY.
DESI'S BALL MOVING SLOWLY.
ASHLEY'S ABOUT TWICE AS FAST.
JUST DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, BOTH
WORK.
YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP YOU BALL
MOVING.
THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
A BIG TRIBAL COUNCIL LOOMING.
WE ARE 30 MINUTES INTO THIS
CHALLENGE NOW.
TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE, RYAN
WAS THE FIRST PERSON OUT AT TWO
SECONDS.
WHO IS GOOD WITH MATH?
HOW MANY MORE TIMES LONGER HAVE
THEY BEEN UP THAN RYAN?
 30 MINUTES?
900 TIMES.
 Jeff: NICE MATH, CHRISSY.
DESI AND ASHLEY STILL GOING.
38 MINUTES.
CHRISSY, WHAT IS THAT TIMES
RYAN?
 1,100 AND CHANGE.
 YOU HAVE NOW BEEN UP THERE
1,100 TIMES LONGER THAN RYAN.
PUT THAT ON YOUR RESUME.
 I WILL.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE INTO
SUDDEN DEATH WHERE BOTH PEOPLE
GO DOWN TO THE MOST NARROW PART
OF THAT BEAM.
THREE, TWO, ONE... ASHLEY
INCHING DOWN THERE.
DESI WOBBLING.
ASHLEY CAN'T MAKE THE MOVE.
ASHLEY DROPS.
DESI WINS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, SAFE THE UNAT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 NICE JOB, ASH.
 YOU GIRLS KILLED IT.
 YEAH, GIRLS.
 Jeff: DESI, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
 NICE JOB, DES.
 Jeff: FIRST PERSON THE WEAR
THIS NECKLACE.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 19
TOUGH DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT.
IT WON'T BE YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 GOING INTO A MERGE VOTE, IT
IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO TAKE
OUT A THREAT, AND THERE ARE SO
MANY THREATS OUT THERE, SO NOW
IS THE TIME FOR THIS HUSTLER AND
HERO ALLIANCE TO COME TOGETHER
AND TRY TO TAKE OUT THE HEALER
TRIBE.
 WOW, DESI AND ASHLEY, THAT
WAS FREAKING IMPRESSIVE.
 GOOD JOB.
 I'M VERY WORRIED.
MY NAME IS BEING THROWN AROUND
BIG TIME.
THERE IS A SOLID CHANCE I'M
GOING HOME TONIGHT, AND
APPARENTLY I HAVE RUBBED BEN THE
WRONG WAY IN MY EATING HABITS.
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF
THIS CURRENTLY AND SEE WHAT I
CAN DO.
 DUDE, I'M SORRY.
I KNOW I RUBBED YOU THE WRONG
WAY WITH FOODSTUFF IN THE PAST.
 I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE NO BODY
FAT TO BURN ON YOU.
 THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.
 EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO CALL YOU OUT
AND BE A BAD GUY.
 I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE,
BECAUSE I DO THAT STUFF WITHOUT
EVEN REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW
OTHER PEOPLE ARE SEEING IT.
I WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY AND THAT
WILL NEVER...
 THE WHOLE THING, CATCHING
FISH AND JUST EATING IT FOR
YOURSELF, YOU KNOW...
 I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT
STUFF, MAN.
 I KNOW, BUD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
 COLE CAME UP AND APOLOGIZED
TO ME.
I DID MY, NO, BUD, WE'RE GOOD.
HE'S A FEDDED ME THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN AT CAMP WITH HIM.
I APPRECIATE YOU OWNING UP TO
IT, LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE
FIRST STEP.
BUT SEPARATING AWAY FROM THE OLD
YAWA TRIBE AND VOTING COLE COULD
BACKFIRE ON ME LATER.
 THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
I HAVE TO THINK TACTICALLY AND
NOT EMOTIONALLY.
SO TACTICALLY SPEAKING, IF I
HAVE TO WORK WITH COLE TO GET
FURTHER IN THE GAME, THEN I
WILL.
 MY NAME IS ON THE BLOCK.
 YOURS ON MINE?
 BOTH OF THEM.
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN.
I SHOULD BE ONE OR TWO.
WHEN IT COMES TO STRATEGY, I GET
IT.
I'M AWARE I MAY BE A TARGET.
I'M A STRONG PLAYER WHEN IT
COMES TO STRATEGY.
I FOUND THE IDOL.
PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED FROM THAT.
 DON'T USE THIS AGAINST ME,
PLEASE, GUY.
 I WON'T.
 ME, BEN, JESS CASH MIKE, AND
LAUREN, LIKE WE KIND OF HAVE
LIKE A PACT, OUR FIVE VOTES GO
THE SAME PLACE.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION: COULD
YOU BRING BEN IN?
HE'S GOING TO FLIP ON Y'ALL.
 BEN IS PLAYING BOTH SIDES.
MY HEALING TRIBE HAS BEEN
COMPROMISED.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY SIPPING ON
BEN'S JOYCE.
 YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO TRIBAL.
JOE GOES OFF IN TRIBAL.
 THAT'S WHAT I DO BEST.
IF I'M FEELING THE HEAT, I HAVE
AN IDOL.
IF I USE IT FOR MYSELF OR IF I
USE IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE AT THE
LAST MINUTE, I'LL MAKE MY FINAL
DECISION.
 TALK TO ME.
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE OUTS BIG
TIME.
 I'VE HEARD THAT HEALERS ARE
TARGETING HEROES.
I FEEL LIKE YOU VOTE CHRISSY,
CHRISSY BEING IN THE GAME IS A
HUGE THREAT.
 SHE'S A BIG TALKER.
 YEAH.
 SHE'S SO SMART.
 SHE JUST THROUGH THEM NUMBERS
OUT THERE LIKE NOTHING TO JEFF.
 FIRST PERSON THAT NEEDS TO GO
IS CHRISSY BECAUSE IN THIS GAME
YOU GOT TO GET OUT THE REALLY
SMART ONES.
THEY CAN TRICK PEOPLE SOME
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE FIVE
HEALERS STRONG AGAINST CHRISSY,
AND I THINK I CAN TRUST LAUREN
TO VOTE WITH US.
NOW WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE.
LAUREN BECAME TIGHT WITH US AT
OUR TRIBE.
WE ALL BECAME TIGHT.
WE ALL TRUST EACH OTHER.
JUST LIKE...
 THAT'S THE THING.
BEN SAYS HE'S WITH US, BUT HE
ALSO HAS ALL OF HIS HEROES BACK
NOW.
 NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES IS
BEN WITH US OR AGAINST US?
 WE NEED TO STICK TO OUR PLAN
WITH THE FIVE, AND I MADE A
VOW...
 WE NEED A HEALER GONE FIRST.
 YOU THINK?
 OH, YEAH.
 BUT LOOK, WE'RE IN THE GOOD
WITH THEM.
WE CAN'T MESS THAT UP.
 I DON'T TRUST COLE.
 I KNOW THAT.
I DON'T EITHER.
BUT LISTEN TO ME, HONEY.
LOOK AT ME.
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES.
 RIGHT.
 OKAY.
 BEN AND I, WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER SINCE YAWA.
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE FROM HEROES.
I WAS THE ONLY ONE FROM
HUSTLERS.
NOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE.
 YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND LET ME KNOW.
 OKAY.
 THIS IS A WHOLE NEW GAME.
IT'S SO MUCH TO FIGURE IT OUT IN
YOUR HEAD AND MAKE A GREAT
DECISION.
IT'S VERY HARD.
 YOU GRACE ARE THINKING COLE
AND NOT JOE?
 IT'S COLE.
AND JOE IS OUR BACK-UP.
 I THINK WHEN WE GO INTO
TRIBAL, THOUGH, WE PLAY IT OFF
AS IF WE'RE VOTING FOR JOE.
THAT WAY JOE WILL PLAY HIS IDOL.
 YOU DON'T THINK COLE HAS THE
IDOL?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 RIGHT NOW THE DISCUSSION IS
WHETHER TO SEND HOME JOE OR
COLE.
THE TRICKY PART IS WE DON'T FOE
IF EITHER OF THEM HAS AN IDOL.
 I THINK WE NEED A PLAN "B."
JOE PLAYS AN IDOL AND COLE
STANDS UP.
PLAN "B" IS LIKE THE NEXT PERSON
IN LINE.
WHO ONE THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE?
I THINK THAT SEEMS TO BE...
 WE HAVE TO.
 I WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO
VOTING JESSICA OUT, BECAUSE WE
THINK THAT JOE MIGHT HAVE AN
IDOL OR GIVE AN IDOL TO COLE,
AND I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT
JESSICA HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
PLUS JESSICA AND COLE HAVE
GOTTEN VERY TIGHT, AND WE WANT
TO SPLIT THEM UP.
I HAVE BEEN APPLYING TO THIS
SHOW FOR 16 YEARS, SO I'M A
STUDENT OF THIS GAME ENOUGH TO
KNOW THAT TRIBAL IS LIVE AND
PEOPLE DO CHANGE THEIR VOTES, I
JUST HOPE THAT I'M ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF IT TONIGHT.
 YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO ME
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLANNING COLE, IS
THAT TRUE?
 CHRISSY, SHE TRUSTS ME, SO
TONIGHT AM I GOING TO HAVE TO
BREAK THAT WITH CHRISSY AND VOTE
HER OUT, OR BREAK AWAY FROM THE
YAWA FIVE AND GET A HEALER OUT?
I'M SITTING IN THE MIDDLE, AND
HAVING THE CHOOSE A SIDE, THIS
IS THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN
A MILLION DOLLAR GAME.
BUT ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN,
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE BATTLE
LINES DRAWN, ALLIANCES ALIGNED,
AND WAR IS NOT A PRETTY THING,
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY
TONIGHT EITHER, BECAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO WAR TONIGHT.
 Jeff: THIS IS YOUR FIRST
TIME AT TRIBAL.
GRAB AN UNLIT TORCH.
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
SO THE MERGE, SIGNIFICANT
BECAUSE IT TRANSITIONS US INTO
THE INDIVIDUAL PART OF THE GAME.
RYAN, WILL REST GO TO OUR
ORIGINAL THEME WHERE WE HAVE
FIVE HEALERS LEFT, FOUR HEROES
LEFT, THREE HUSTLERS.
HOW BIG A PART WAS THAT THIS
AFTERNOON IN LOOKING AT WHAT
MIGHT HAPPEN TONIGHT?
 YEAH, I THINK YOU HAVE THOSE
ORIGINAL TRIBE DIVISIONS, BUT
YOU HAVE THE DIVISIONS THAT WE
WERE IN FOR THE LAST EIGHT DAY,
AS WELL.
 Jeff: DR. MIKE, WHY NOT
JUST SAY, LET'S JUST ALL AGREE
TO TAKE OUT A HEALER AND START
LEVELING THIS PLAYING FIELD.
THEY HAVE FIVE?
 THAT WOULD BE FIRST SIMPLE
MOVE, BUT MOST OF THE PLAYERS
HERE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THE
SECOND MOVE AND THE THIRD MOVE
ARE.
WHAT I SAW IS PEOPLE SCRAMBLING,
PEOPLE REALLY NERVOUS.
 JEFF, WE CAN GO BACK AND
FORTH AND SAY, OH, I'M PARANOID.
I HEARD LIKE THREE NAMES
TONIGHT.
SO FOR ALL 12 ON TO BE NERVOUS,
SMELL [BLEEPED].
 Jeff: COLE, THERE IS AN
ANSWER YOU GIVE AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, WHICH IS I'M CONCERNED,
AND THEN THERE'S THE TRUTH, I'M
ACTUALLY NOT CONCERNED TONIGHT.
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY
TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE
ALIGNED WITH, I TRUST YOU.
 ABSOLUTELY.
I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE STRONG
ALLIANCES AND MAKE SURE THOSE
BONDS ARE TIGHT, SO I'M GOING TO
SAY IT RIGHT NOW, I TRUST YOU
AND I'M NOT WORRIED.
 Jeff: LAUREN, THE
DEFINITION OF WHAT MAKES SOMEONE
A TARGET CHANGES TRIBAL TO
TRIBAL.
DID YOU FEEL THAT EVERYBODY WAS
EVALUATING EVERY TYPE OF THREAT
TO DETERMINE WHO THEY WERE GOING
TO VOTE FOR?
 YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW, ARE THEY A PHYSICAL
THREAT NOW?
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A THREAT
LATER DOWN THE ROAD?
OR DO THEY JUST FLAT OUT GET ON
YOUR NERVES?
IT'S JUST NOT ABOUT TONIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT EVERY OTHER NIGHT
AFTER THIS.
 Jeff: CHRISSY, DID YOU FEEL
THAT, AS WELL?
 YEAH, TYPICALLY IN
"SURVIVOR," RIGHT AFTER THE
MERGE, IT IS THE PHYSICAL
THREATS, BUT THIS SEASON WE ARE
LOOKING AT MUCH MORE THAN
PHYSICAL THREATS.
 Jeff: JOE, YOU SEEM TO BE
NODDING YOUR HEAD AT THAT.
 I'VE BEEN HONEST SINCE DAY
ONE.
I'M STRATEGIC, PHYSICAL, AND I'M
A SMART DUDE, BUT THERE ARE
BIGGER THREATS OUT THERE.
EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
TRUST, BUT ARE YOU ABOUT THAT
LIFE?
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT THAT LIFE.
I'VE BEEN AT TRIBAL BEFORE.
I TOLD DESI, I GOT YOU, AND
WE'RE BOTH HERE TODAY SOME DO
YOU WANT SOMEONE THAT'S THROWING
OUT NAMES SAYING, I'M GOING TO
VOTE WITH Y'ALL THIS TRIBAL, BUT
NEXT TRIBAL SEE YA.
ALL THESE PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL
THEY DO.
 Jeff: DR. MIKE, DOES THAT
GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT
THAT IF JOE IS TELLING THE
TRUTH, THAT'S GOOD FOR ME,
BECAUSE I'M A HEALER, TOO, AND
SO IS JESS CASH AND SO IS COLE.
 WELL, SURE, IF I WASN'T AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE HEALERS.
JOE SAYS FROM DAY ONE, I TOLL
YOU GUYS I GOT YOUR BACK, EXCEPT
MIKE, AND I'M GOING TO SAY, HEY,
MIKE, YOU'RE NOT IN MY CIRCLE OF
TRUST.
DUCEY.
IT WAS LIKE, MIKE IS LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL, BUT REALLY JOE WENT
AND FOUND THE IDOL, BUT WE'VE
MENTIONEDDED OUR BONDS OVER
TIME, I HAVE A CERTAIN LOVE AND
RESPECT FOR JOE.
 I'M SORRY.
DID I SAY I FOUND "A IDOL" I
FOUND IDOLS.
LET'S SWITCH UP THE GAME.
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THIS VOTE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT NEXT VOTE,
BECAUSE NAMES ARE GOING TO BE
THROWN AROUND.
EVERYONE IS UNCOMFORTABLE?
AM I GOING TO PLAY IT OR NOT
PLAY IT.
I'M GOING TO ROCK IT FOR RIGHT
NOW, SO YOU ALL FIGURE IT OUT.
I'M CHILLING RIGHT NOW.
 THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
 WOW.
 COLE, YOU HAD A REACTION WHEN
JOE PULLED THAT OUT.
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR
HEAD?
 I KNOW THE NAMES THAT WERE
BROUGHT UP TODAY, IT WAS ME AND
JOE, AND JOE'S SAFE.
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THAT SAME
PROTECTION.
SO IT COULD BE MY FIRST AND LAST
TRIBAL.
 WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
 Jeff: JESSICA, THAT IS HOW
FAST THIS GAME CHANGES.
A BOMB WAS JUST DROPPED, AND I
THINK EVERYONE IS GOING, IT
COULD BE ME.
 ABSOLUTELY.
IDOLS CHANGE THIS WHOLE GAME.
YOU BEGIN TO QUESTION YOUR OLD
ALLIANCES, YOUR NEW ALLIANCES.
JOE WAS ON MY FIRST TRIBE, AND
SO NOW I'M THINKING, ARE WE
GOOD, DEUCES?
 JEFF, JOE DOES TALK A LOT,
BUT JOE HAD MY BACK SINCE DAY
ONE, WE FOUND THAT FIRST IDOL
TOGETHER.
SO IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THESE WHERE
I'M STICKING SAYING IN MY HEAD,
I'M NOT WORRIED.
I TRUST YOU.
 THE BATTLE LINES ARE DRAWN,
JEFF.
 Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHO
IS ALIGNED WITH WHO, AND SOMEONE
IS GOING HOME.
 Jeff: YOU'RE RIGHT, BECAUSE
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JESSICA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 IT'S ONLY RIGHT TO START OFF
FRESH, THIS IS FOR ME.
 Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JOE WILL NOT
COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, CHRISSY.
JESSICA.
CHRISSY.
JESSICA.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES CHRISSY,
TWO VOTES JESSICA.
CHRISSY.
JESSICA.
THREE VOTES JESSICA.
CHRISSY.
FOUR VOTES CHRISSY.
TIED AGAIN.
FOUR VOTES CHRISSY.
FOUR VOTES JESSICA.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES CHRISSY.
TIED AGAIN.
FIVE VOTES CHRISSY, FIVE VOTES
JESSICA.
JESSICA, THAT'S SIX VOTES
JESSICA, FIVE VOTES CHRISSY, ONE
VOTE LEFT.
SEVENTH PERSON VOLTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR," JESSICA, YOU NEED TO
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JESSICA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 Jeff: ON "SURVIVOR," WHEN
BATTLE LINES ARE DRAWN, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHO GOES HOME, IT'S ABOUT
WHO SURVIVORS AND THE NEW LINES
THAT ARE DRAWN.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE HEALERS' FUTURE
LOOKS GRIM.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE
WORLD.
 WE GOT COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.
 Jeff: BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
 COME HERE, COME HERE.
GET IT, J.T.
 COLE JUST STARTED DIGGING.
 AN IDOL.
 PANDEMONIUM IS ENSUING IN
FRONT OF ME.
 I THINK I EXPERIENCED THE
BIGGEST BLINDSIDE OF MY LIFE.
MY HEART IS BROKEN.
WHO KNEW A GAME COULD CRUSH YOU.
I THOUGHT ONLY GUYS COULD DO
THAT.
I WAS WRONG.
BUTTERY MISS COLE.
I HOPE THAT HE MAKES IT FAR AND
MAYBE WE CAN STILL HAVE A DATE
WHEN "SURVIVOR" IS OVER.
