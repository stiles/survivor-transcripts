         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE...
 CONGRATULATION, EVERYONE.
 Jeff: ...BRAIN AND BRAWN
WERE TRYING TO COURT BREWTY OVER
TO THEIR SIDE.
 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE OPTIONS.
 Jeff: DEBBIE WASTE NOD
TIME.
 I WANT TO GET IN AN ALLIANCE.
 Jeff: AGGRESSIVELY TRYING








TO SECURE THE NUMBERS.
 IT'S A DONE DEAL.
I SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE FEW
PEOPLE THAT PLAYS OFFENSE.
 Jeff: BUT THINGS BACKFIRED.
 DEBBIE TAKES STRATEGY IN HER
HANDS FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE.
 Jeff: ALIENATING THE
BRAINS.
 WE'RE SCREWED BECAUSE OF IT.
 Jeff: LEAVING THE BEAUTIES
WITH AN EASY DECISION.
 WE'RE GOING WITH BRAWN.
 AGREED.








 Jeff: TO UNITE WITH BRAWN.
 WE'RE JUST SHOVING GEEKS IN
LOCKERS RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: FOR THE BRAINS,
THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE.
 UH-OH.
 Jeff: WHEN NEAL FELL VICTIM
TO THE ELEMENTS.
YOU ARE PULLING NEAL FROM THE
GAME?
 I THINK I HAVE TO.
 MY NUMBER-ONE ALLY, GONE.
THE IDOL WENT HOME WITH NEAL.
THAT SON OF A BITCH.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN THE GAME
HAS CHANGED.
TEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 PREVIOUSLY ON "SURVIVOR,"
IT'S OKAY TO BE HAPPY AND SAD IN
THE SAME MOMENT.
IT IS WHAT IT IS, BUT WE'RE ALL
HERE.
 WE'RE HERE.
A NEW DAY.
 IT MAKES ME WANT TO KEEP ALL
MY CUTS LIKE SUPER CLEAN.
 TODAY I DON'T FEEL VERY
POWERFUL AT ALL THAT WE LOST
NEAL.
WITH NEAL BEING GONE, IT TOTALLY
SCREWS UP OUR NUMBERS.
THE BRAIN TRIBE IS THREE,
DEBBIE, MYSELF AND AUBRY.
 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO
SAY.
 "SURVIVOR" IS LIKE A BOX OF
CHOCOLATES.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO GET.
 SO WE'RE LOW TOTEM, AND IT'S
IN STATE OF FLUX RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER
OPTIONS.
 I GOT TO PUT MY THINKING CAP
ON.
 IT AIN'T OVER UNTIL IT'S
OVER.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 NOW WE'LL JUST DICTATE LIKE
WE WERE.
 DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
 WE'RE PRETTY UNITED TOGETHER,
BREWTY AN BRAWN, AND PRETTY SET
IN STONE THAT THE BRAINS ALL GOT
TO GO.
AS FAR AS I KNOW, NEAL WENT HOME
WITH AN IDOL, BUT IF HE LEFT IT
IN THE GAME SOMEHOW, THE PLAN
MOVING FORWARD IS TO SPLIT THE
VOTE EACH TIME, MAKE SURE IF IT
IS AN IDOL, IT'S PLAYED, BUT
WE'RE ALWAYS SAFE, BECAUSE WE'RE
7-3.
 BEAUTY KEEPS VOTING FOR
BRAINS UNTIL SHE'S GONE.
BRAWN WILL VOTE FOR AUBRY.
NICE AND SIMPLE.
WE DO OUR THING.
 AUBRY IS COMING BACK.
 I CAN KIND OF JUST SENSE
WHAT'S GOING ON.
THIS IS TOTALLY LIKE HIGH
SCHOOL.
YOU LOOK AT OUR CAMP, AND IT'S
DIVIDED BY THE TOUGH GUYS AND
AROUND THEM ARE THE GIRLS WHO
ARE KIND OF PRETTY AND GET ALONG
REALLY WELL WITH THOSE PEOPLE
AND THEN KIND OF THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE MAYBE A LITTLE SHYER, A
LITTLE BIT NERDY ON THE OUTSIDE.
 THEY'RE ALL GLAD TO SEE HIM
GO.
 YEAH.
BUT THE JOCKS AND THE PRETTY
PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIT
PRETTY FOREVER.
THEY AGE AND GET OVERRIPE, AND
THEN THEY'RE DONE.
EVENTUALLY THE MISFITS GET
REVENGE.
IF I FIND A CRACK OR START A
LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE, I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO FIND MY WAY IN.
 YOU EVER LET YOUR DAUGHTER DO
YOUR HAIR?
 ALL THE TIME.
SHE DOES MY MAKE-UP.
SHE'S AWESOME.
AND CHLOE IS CHLOE.
SOME OF YOU KNOW IT, SOME OF YOU
DON'T, MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT.
CHLOE HAS AUTISM, FAIRLY BAD TO
A CERTAIN POINT.
SHE'S IN KINDERGARTEN.
WE'RE DEALING WITH IT.
WE GO TO THERAPY THREE TIMES A
WEEK IN THE MORNING.
WE GO TO THERAPY AFTER SCHOOL.
O.T., SPEECH THERAPY, PHYSICAL
THERAPY.
I CAME IN THIS GAME SAYING I
WASN'T GOING TO USE MY DAUGHTERS
TO GET AHEAD, BUT IF SOMEONE
ASKS ME ABOUT MY KIDS, I JUST
TELL THE TRUTH, BECAUSE I WAS
NAIVE TO AUTISM UNTIL WE PUT THE
PIECES TOGETHER AND MY DAUGHTER
GOT DIAGNOSED WITH IT.
SO PRETTY MUCH EVERY RED CENT I
MAKE GOES TO HOSPITALS, DOCTORS,
AND WE LIVE VERY POOR BECAUSE OF
IT, BUT HAPPY BECAUSE WE SEE HER
MAKE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE.
IF ANYTHING IT MAKES PEOPLE
AWARE THAT THERE'S FAMILIES OUT
THERE THAT HAVE KIDS WITH
AUTISM, AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
AND IT'S WAY MORE WIDELY POPULAR
THAN PEOPLE BELIEVE.
IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO HELP ME
OUT, BUT I THINK IT MADE A LOT
OF THEM REALIZE I'M NOT JUST
THIS DEVIANT, DOMINANT MUSCLE,
BUT THAT I'M HUMAN TOO.
SHE'S PERFECT, THOUGH.
IT'S HOW SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WITH IT.
I JUST WISH I COULD HELP HER
MORE.
 JASON CHOSE A NICE
OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP ABOUT HIS
LIFE.
PEOPLE TEND TO SEE A MORE
BRAWNY, ANGRIER, JUST LOUD TYPE
OF JASON.
I'VE SEEN ALL ASPECTS OF HIM.
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE IT, BUT YOU
CAN SEE HOW HE WOULD BE MORE OF
A CHALLENGE TO BEAT NOW TOWARD
THE END.
I'D GIVE HIM SOME MONEY, TOO.
 IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
 AT THIS POINT IT'S MY OWN
GAME, I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO I
CAN TRUST AND WHO WILL GET ME
FURTHER.
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE BIG
PICTURE NOW.
WHO WILL YOU BEAT?
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU DIVIDE INTO TWO
TEAMS OF FIVE.
ON MY GO YOU RACE OUT AND USE
STEPPING POLES TO TRANSFER ONE
TRIBE MEMBER FROM ONE LARGE
PLATFORM TO ANOTHER.
THEN YOU'LL ALL SWIM OUT TO A
VERY SMALL TOWER.
THE FIRST TEAM TO GET ALL FIVE
TRIBE MEMBERS TO THE TOP OF THAT
TOWER WITH YOUR FEET ON OUR
ABOVE THE TOP DECK WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: ICE CREAM.
I WANT TO WHET YOUR APPETITE,
INSPIRE THE MOTIVATION.
 AMAZING.
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO SHARE.
ONE BOWL.
THE ICE CREAM WILL BE DELIVERED
TO YOU AT CAMP.
AN YOU WILL FEAST UNTIL YOUR
BELLY IS FULL.
 WOW.
 OH, NO.
 Jeff: WE'LL DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK.
WE'LL DRAW FOR CAPTAINS AND GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE TWO VERY DIFFERENT
TEAMS.
JULIA WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE WENT FOR THE TWO LARGEST AND
THE TWO SMALLEST, NICK, DEBBIE,
SCOT AND TAI.
AUBRY WAS A CAPTAIN AND WENT
MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD
WITH CYDNEY, MICHELE, JOE AND
JASON.
TIME TO FIND OUT WHO MADE THE
BETTER CHOICE.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, "SURVIVOR" --
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSFER ONE
PERSON USING THESE POLES.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON HAS TO
GO UP TOP ON THIS PLATFORM.
IT'S GOING TO BE JULIA AND
AUBRY.
THE TWO CAPTAINS WILL ALSO BE
THE ONES BEING TRANSPORTED.
THIS IS WHERE TEAMWORK REALLY
COMES INTO PLAY.
 CLOSER.
 GO.
 GOOD JOB.
 Jeff: AUBRY NOW MOVING TO
THAT SECOND POST.
JULIA TRYING TO GET TO THE
SECOND.
 GO.
 JUST GO, JUST GO, JUST GO.
 Jeff: AUBRY TAKES A DUNK.
SHE'S GOING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER
GO.
THERE IS DEFINITELY A LEARNING
CURVE.
 A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.
SORRY.
 Jeff: AUBRY NOW GIVING IT
ANOTHER GO.
AUBRY MOVING AROUND.
AUBRY GOES BACK IN.
JULIA NOW MOVING FURTHER ALONG
THIS COURSE.
ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT, YOU CAN
MOVE QUICKLY, SO DON'T GIVE UP.
AUBRY NOW GIVING IT ANOTHER GO.
IT'S A LOT MORE STEADY THIS
TIME.
 GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.
 Jeff: AUBRY GOES BACK IN
AGAIN.
THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE SEEING THE
ADVANTAGE FOR JULIA'S TEAM.
SCOT AND NICK HAVING A LOT OF
STRENGTH.
THAT SAME STRENGTH AND SIZE WILL
BE AN OBSTACLE COME THE END OF
THIS CHALLENGE.
FOR BLUE AUBRY GIVING IT ANOTHER
GO.
AUBRY GOES IN AGAIN.
THEY'RE GOING TO SWITCH OUT NOW.
MICHELE GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
JULIA'S REALLY GOT IT FIGURED
OUT, GREAT BALANCE AND GREAT
TEAMWORK BY NICK AND TAI AND
SCOT AND DEBBIE.
 GOTCHA.
 Jeff: JULIA HALF-WAY THERE.
MICHELE GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE RHYTHM.
 GOOD JOB.
 Jeff: MICHELE UNDETERRED
TRYING TO GET SOME RHYTHM GOING.
JOE AND CYDNEY TRYING TO HOLD
HER IN PLACE.
JASON AND AUBRY MOVING AROUND.
 MOVE IT CLOSER.
 Jeff: MICHELE WITH ANOTHER
STEP.
CAN'T HANG IN THERE.
GOT TO GO BACK AND START AGAIN.
 HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT,
HOLD IT.
 Jeff: JULIA GETTING CLOSER
TO THE PLATFORM.
YOU DROP NOW AND YOU HAVE TO GO
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
BEGINNING.
JULIA NOW IN TROUBLE FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
JULIA STRUGGLING TO STAY ON BUT
SHE DOES.
NICE RECOVERY.
MICHELE DROPS AGAIN.
CYDNEY NOW GOING TO GIVE IT A
GO.
YOU'RE ONLY AS STABLE AS THOSE
POLES ARE STABLE IN THE WATER.
JULIA JUST ABOUT DROPS AGAIN.
CYDNEY GOES IN.
JULIA NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO JUMP.
SHE NEEDS ONE MORE.
 YOU GUYS GOT IT?
 YES, YES, GOT IT.
 Jeff: THAT WILL DO IT.
JULIA'S ACROSS.
EVERYBODY GET UP ON THE
PLATFORM.
 OH, MY LEGS ARE SHAKING.
 Jeff: GO, GO!
IT IS JULIA, DEBBIE, NICK, TAI
AND SCOT.
THEY'RE THROUGH FIRST PART OF
THIS CHALLENGE.
CYDNEY GOES FACE FIRST IN AGAIN.
NOW THEY JUST GOT TO GET ALL
FIVE TO THE TOP OF A VERY SMALL
TOWER.
SCOT'S FEET ARE BIGGER THAN THE
BASE OF THE TOWER.
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW
DIFFICULT THIS IS GOING TO BE
FOR THEM.
MICHELE BACK IN NOW.
AND BACK IN THE WATER.
TAI THE LAST ONE.
YOU JUST GOT TO GET UP THERE AND
ON YOUR FEET.
IT IS A BLOWOUT IN THE MAKING.
ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR BLUE.
Jeff:THREE, TWO, ONE, THAT'S IT!
AWARD FOR SCOT, NICK, DEBBIE,
JULIA AND TAI.
 I'M SORRY, GUYS.
 Jeff: JULIA, YOU CLEARLY
MADE THE RIGHT CHOICES.
ICE CREAM WILL BE DELIVERED TO
CAMP FOR YOU TO ENJOY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
SWIM ON BACK AND AWAIT YOUR
REWARD.
 WHEN PEOPLE SAY IN "SURVIVOR"
THAT ONE BAD DECISION HAS A
CENTERBALL EFFECT, DAMN, I FEEL
THE AVALANCHE RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD ABOVE WATER.
FIRST NEAL IS OUT OF THE GAME.
THEN I PICKED THE TEAM, AND
APPARENTLY IT WAS A BIG MESS UP.
IT SUCK, I WANTED SO MUCH MORE
THAN.
THIS I'M NOT GIVING UP, BUT I
FEEL LIKE I KEEP MAKING BAD
DECISION AFTER BAD DECISION.
 WHEW, ICE CREAM!
WE WALK INTO CAMP AFTER THE
REWARD CHALLENGE, AND THE
WINNING GROUP OF FIVE GOT TO GO
TO THE ICE CREAM PARLOR.
 CAN I GET A SCOOP OF
CHOCOLATE AND A SCOOP OF COFFEE?
 CHERRIES.
 WHIPPED CREAM.
 THE OTHER FIVE HAD TO GO SIT
IN PURGATORY AND LISTEN TO US
EAT ICE CREAM FROM 15, 20 FEET
AWAY.
 SPRINKLES.
 I'LL DO A ROOT BEER FLOAT.
 I'LL MAKE A CHOCOLATE WAFFLE
CONE.
 THE ICE CREAM WAS AN AWESOME
TREAT.
IT WAS FANTASTIC TO HAVE A
MOMENT OF BEING FULL, OR KNOWING
YOU'RE WELL STOCKED FOR TOMORROW
WITH GLUCOSE, AND I DIDN'T FEEL
SORRY FOR THE LOSERS ONE BIT.
 IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD THAT WE
HAVE TO SIT HERE, BUT WE FORMED
A NICE LITTLE COMMUNITY HERE.
 YOU CAN BE ROWDY.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU WON ICE CREAM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO QUIET.
 I THINK THAT JASON DOES THINK
THAT HE'S IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF
THINGS OVER AT THIS CAMP, AND,
YOU KNOW, JASON IS JUST AN
ASSERTIVE PERSON.
HE YELLS OVER, "GUYS, YOU CAN BE
A LITTLE MORE LOUD ABOUT IT IF
YOU WANT," AND HONESTLY, I
RESPECTED THE WAY THEY HANDLED
IT.
 I NEED TO ONCE A WEEK.
 MY MOM LIVES IN UTAH.
SHE'S IN AN ASSISTED LIVING.
SHE'S GOT HEALTH ISSUES.
SHE'S ONLY 75.
SHE'S GOT A RARE DISEASE.
IT'S BASICALLY THE INVERSE OF
ALS.
 IS YOUR FATHER ALIVE?
 NO, MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS
16?
 ARE YOU RELIGIOUS OR MORMON
OR...
 I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH
SINCE I WAS A KID, WELL, 17, 18
YEARS OLD, BUT MY WHOLE WORLD
REVOLVES AROUND MY FAMILY, AND
THAT'S EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE
MORMON RELIGION.
 I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL.
 THAT WAS ONE OF THE
ADVANTAGE, THAT'S WHY I TAKE
CARE OF MY WHOLE FAMILY.
WE WERE ALL POOR, AND MY
BROTHERS CHOSE RELIGION AND
FAMILY, AND I CHOSE THE NBA.
THEY STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY, SO
I...
 SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP
THEM EVEN MORE?
 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
 THAT'S VERY NOBLE.
THE REWARD WAS LICK A RANDOM
GROUP OF PEOPLE, SO WE COULDN'T
TALK STRATEGY, BUT IT WAS THE
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A
BOND, AND I THINK THAT SCOT AND
I COULD DEFINITELY WORK WELL
TOGETHER.
I LIKE HAVING HIM ON MY TEAM.
HE'S AWESOME.
 IT'S ALL RIGHT.
 WE'RE GOING.
WE'RE GOING.
 DON'T DO ANYTHING.
 I WOULD BE A TERRIBLE TEAM
MEMBER.
, A TERRIBLE ROWING TEAM MEMBER.
 JOE, JOE, I DON'T THINK THEY
CAN HEAR US.
 HE WEARS A HEARING AID.
 DOES HE?
 HE LEFT IT AT HOME.
 I'LL TRY TO DO IT WITH AUBRY
AND DEBBIE.
THEY NEED A FOURTH.
 SCOT AND JASON ARE WORRIED
ABOUT AN ALL-GIRLS ALLIANCE.
ME NOT SO MUCH.
I DON'T THINK IT EXISTS.
BUT WHATEVER.
 WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT NUMBER
UP, SO IT'S GOT TO BE A GIRL.
 IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THEM.
 HOW WAS IT?
AFTER THE GIRLS GET BACK, I WANT
TO BE UPDATED WITH JULIA, IS SHE
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH JULIA
STRATEGY-WISE.
 DID ANYTHING HAPPEN ON THE
BOAT TODAY?
 NO, NOTHING.
 OKAY.
 JASON AND SCOT, THEY'RE
AFRAID OF AN ALL-GIRLS ALLIANCE.
 THERE'S NO ALL-GIRLS
ALLIANCE.
 I KNOW.
 ONE THING ABOUT NICK, HE IS
THE MOST INDY STREET PERSON ON
THIS ISLAND.
HE LITERALLY WALKS MAYBE 50
STEPS WHERE I CAN TURN AND SEE
YOU STANDING AND TALKING, HOW
STUPID CAN YOU BE.
MY FACE IS STARTING TO TWITCH
AND I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOODNESS,
I'M GOING TO SNAP.
NICK CAME BACK, AND HE WAS LIKE,
OH, SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
AND I'M LIKE, BRRR.
 WHEN WE GOT BACK, NICK WENT
OUT TO TALK TO JULIA.
YOU BETTER SEND SOMEBODY TO
CHECK UP ON US.
AND WHEN WE CAME BACK, NICK
SAID, THEY DIDN'T SAY NOTHING.
THAT'S KIND OF SUSPECT TO ME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME?
I'M NOT PLOTTING AGAINST YOU
ALL.
 WE DIDN'T SEND ANYONE TO
CHECK ON ANYONE.
 IT'S NOT YOU GUYS.
 I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
HOW IT LOOKS TO ME.
 SCOT, MYSELF AND NICK BROUGHT
UP THE IDEA, HOPE THEY'RE NOT
TALKING AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.
LATER NICK TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF
TO GO ASK ONE OF THE GIRL, BUT
THAT PISSED CYDNEY OFF.
PARANOIA WILL KICK IN AT A
CERTAIN POINT WITH EVERYBODY,
AND I THINK SHE HIT IT SOONER
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.
 WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
 LEGITIMATELY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ALL SAID.
 I TOLD YOU WHAT WE SAID OVER
THERE.
 ABOUT WHAT?
 WE WERE SITTING THERE.
NICK SAID, YOU THINK THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT A GIRL ALLIANCE.
SCOT AND I SAID, I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN CYDNEY COMES
BACK.
WE DIDN'T TELL HIM TO GO NOWHERE
OR DO NOTHING, AND THEN YOU BLEW
UP.
 NO, I ASKED A QUESTION.
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE
I'M LIKE, HOLD ON, BECAUSE I HAD
TO PUT HIM IN CHECK REAL QUICK,
DON'T CHECK ME, YOU'RE NOT MY
DAMN DAD.
IT'S LIKE THE BOYS CAN TALK TO
WHOMEVER, BUT WHEN I TALK TO
SOMEBODY, UH-OH, IS THERE A
GIRL'S ALLIANCE, OH, NO, NO, NO,
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IRRITATED
CYDNEY.
IRRITATED CYDNEY WILL BLOW THE
WHOLE GAME UP.
I'M CALLING OUT YOUR IDOLS.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
 YOU KNOW I GOT YOUR BACK.
 YOU BETTER REALIZE I'M NOT
THE LITTLE GIRL ON THIS ISLAND.
DON'T CHECK ME, INTO.
THE CURRENT PLAN IS TO SPLIT THE
VOTE FOR AUBRY AND MISS DEBBIE
UNTIL ALL THE BRAINS ARE GONE,
BUT THE GUYS HAVE TO GO, THE
GUYS HAVE TO GO.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
NICK, YOU DIDN'T NEED IT, BUT
NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN WIN IT.
 YEAH, WONDERFUL.
 ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE IN A VERY
NARROW PERCH WHILE HOLDING A
HANDLE BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
IF AT ANY POINT YOU LET GO OF
THE HANDLE OR A FOOT COMES OFF
THE PERCH, YOU'RE OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AFTER
22 TOUGH DAYS IN THIS GAME.
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
HANDS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THAT
HANDLE.
BOTH FEET HAVE TO STAY ON THE
PERCH.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
EVERYBODY LOCKS GOOD.
TEN PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME.
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
NINE.
IT'S GOING TO HURT AND IT'S
GOING TO HURT FAST.
YOU WILL FEEL IT QUICKLY.
TAI, YOU'RE STRUGGLING.
EARLY SIGNS OF PAIN.
NICE, HOT, SUNNY DAY.
ANYBODY WANT TO OWN UP THEY'RE
ALREADY FEELING IT?
 I'M JUST GETTING COMFORTABLE.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, IS THIS WHAT
YOU IMAGINED WHEN YOU SIGNED UP
FOR "SURVIVOR"?
 IT'S A LITTLE BIT WORSE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU'VE BEEN UP THERE LONG
ENOUGH TO HAVE AN IDEA WHERE
THIS IS HEADING.
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSE, VERY
HOT SUN.
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET
WORSE, BUT SOME OF YOU FEEL VERY
COMFORTABLE ABOUT TONIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO ADMIT IT
AROUND CAMP, SO I'M GOING TO
TEMPT YOU TO ADMIT IT RIGHT NOW.
I'M GOING TO BRING OUT SOME
FOOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: THE TWIST IS THIS
WILL BE YOUR ONE AND ONLY
OPPORTUNITY AT TEMPTATION.
SO THE QUESTION YOU NEED TO BE
THINKING ABOUT AS I GO GET THE
FOOD IS, AM I WILLING TO STEP
DOWN AND GIVE UP A SHOT AT
IMMUNITY FOR FOOD OR COULD THAT
POSSIBLY BE A MILLION DOLLAR
MISTAKE?
DON'T STEP DOWN UNTIL I GIVE YOU
THAT WINDOW.
 I KNOW.
 Jeff: JULIA, I AM SO SORRY
I MISSED THAT AND I'M SO SORRY
IT HAPPENED FOR YOU SECONDS TOO
SOON.
YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS
IT'S GOING TO BE A BUFFET, FOUR
PIZZA, BROWNIES, DRUM STICKS AND
SIX HOT DOGS, AND YOU NEED
SOMETHING TO RINSE THAT DOWN
WITH, SOME COLD DRINKS.
 I'M TAKING IT.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TEN SECONDS.
I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU DOWN.
AFTER THIS, NO MORE TEMPTATION.
 JEFF, HURRY, PLEASE.
 Jeff: HERE WE GO, TEN,
NINE...
 I'LL TAKE IT.
 I'LL TAKE IT.
 I'LL TAKE IT.
 Jeff: SEVEN, SIX, FIVE.
FIVE SECONDS LEFT.
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
 I'M STAYING.
 Jeff: THAT'S IT.
JASON IS OUT.
SCOT IS OUT.
JOE IS OUT.
MICHELE IS OUT.
THAT IS A LOT OF FOOD FOR FOUR
PEOPLE.
[BURPING]
WE'RE LEFT WITH NICK, TAI, DEB
DEBBIE, CYDNEY AND AUBRY
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.
TAI, DID YOU CONSIDER STEPPING
DOWN?
 NO, I WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I
CAN PUSH MY BODY.
ALSO I DON'T WANT ANY OF THE
BRAIN TO GET IT.
 Jeff: WOW, NICK, THAT WAS A
VERY BOLD STATEMENT.
 YEAH, IT'S OBVIOUS AT THIS
POINT.
 Jeff: WHAT'S OBVIOUS?
 THAT THE BRAINS ARE
OUTNUMBERED.
THAT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE,
JOE, AUBRY AND DEBBIE.
WE'RE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
 I CAN'T DO IT.
 Jeff: DEBBIE CANNOT TAKE IT
ANYMORE.
DEBBIE IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.
DEBBIE JOINS JULIA, OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE BUT NOT PARTICIPATING
IN THE FOOD OR DRINK.
HOW IS THAT GOING DOWN, JASON?
 BEAUTIFULLY.
 Jeff: FOUR PEOPLE LEFT WITH
A SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
AUBRY I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR FACE.
IT IS PAINFUL.
OUT OF NOWHERE AUBRY DROPS AND
RIGHT BEHIND AUBRY NICK DROPS,
JUST LIKE THAT WE'RE DOWN TO
TWO.
NICK, HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT
TONIGHT GIVEN THAT GOING TO YOUR
FIRST TRIBAL YOU DECIDE TO STEP
DOWN AND GIVE UP IMMUNITY.
 I THOUGHT CYDNEY HAD THIS IN
THE BAG FROM THE BEGINNING, AND,
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DECISION
WHETHER TO STEP DOWN OR TO MAKE
SURE ALL THE BRAINS ARE OUT.
AND I HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.
BUT I'M EXCITED, AS WELL, TO
FINALLY GET THERE AFTER 22 DAYS.
 Jeff: YOU JUST HOPE IT'S
NOT BITTERSWEET.
 IT WON'T BE, BUDDY.
 Jeff: TAI AND CYDNEY
BATTLING IT OUT FOR IMMUNITY.
 ARE YOU NUMB AT ALL, CYDNEY?
 NOPE, I'M JUST PEACHY.
 Jeff: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
 SHE'S SO STILL.
 WOW.
 Jeff: SO TAI, THE BRAINS
ARE ALL GONE.
IT'S JUST YOU AND CYDNEY.
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN BEAT
CYDNEY, OR IS THIS TRULY JUST TO
SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN GO?
 I WANT TO SEE HOW FAR I'M
GOING TO PUSH.
BUT YOU CAN'T BE THAT STRONG.
SOMETIMES STRONG PEOPLE ARE
STRONG UNTIL ONE POINT AND THEN
THEY BREAK.
I'M LIKE A BAMBOO.
WINDS KEEP BLOWING, BLOWING,
BLOWING, I'M RESILIENT.
I WENT THROUGH WAR.
I WENT THROUGH REFUGEE CAMP.
THERE'S NO COMPARISON.
SHE'S A STRONG WOMAN, BUT SHE
MIGHT SNAP.
 NO TIME SOON, TAI, NO TIME
SOON.
 Jeff: TAI AND CYDNEY, BIG
DIFFERENCE IN BODY TYPE.
BOTH APPEAR TO SHARE THE SAME
SORT OF MIND-SET.
 OH, NO.
 Jeff: BEEN UP THERE 40
MINUTES NOW.
 TOUGH PEOPLE.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 THAT'S INSANE.
 Jeff: TAI, FOR ALL OF THE
PAIN YOU APPEAR TO BE IN, YOU'RE
STILL IN THIS.
 RIGHT NOW, I'M TAKING IT ONE
SECOND AT A TIME.
I'M CALLING BUDDHA.
 Jeff: WHAT'S HE SAYING?
 NO, I'M JUST CHANTING.
[CHANTING]
YOU'RE FEELING IT.
I SAW IT ON YOUR FACE.
 Jeff: OH, OUT OF THE BLUE,
THE MOST UNLIKELY OF THINGS TO
HAPPEN, CYDNEY DROPS.
TAI WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
UNBELIEVABLE TURN OF EVENTS.
 WOW.
 OH, MY BACK.
 Jeff: WOW.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE
THAT HAPPEN.
 GOOD JOB.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: TAI, CAN YOU COME
OVER?
 YES.
I CAN RUN EVEN.
 Jeff: GOOD EFFORT.
YOU WANTED IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALLY
THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PULL
IT OUT OR NOT, BUT YOU NEVER
GAVE UP.
TAI IS SAFE.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME AFTER 22 DAY, BUT
WHAT TAI JUST SHOWED IS KEEP
FIGHTING ALL THE WAY UNTIL WE
VOTE.
CONGRATS.
YOU'RE SAFE TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 Jeff: TONIGHT ALL THE
BEAUTY VOTE FOR DEBBIE.
ALL THE BROWN VOTE FOR AUBRY.
I'M SAFE TONIGHT, BUT WHO KNOWS?
I WON THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
I EARNED THAT.
IT WAS ONE HELL OF A CHALLENGE.
 TAI, THAT WAS AMAZING.
 THAT WAS AWESOME.
 I'VE SEEN ULTRA MARATHONERS
RUNNING ACROSS THE SAHARA.
THAT WAS EXCELLENT.
WAY TO SUFFER, MAN.
CYDNEY, HONESTLY, YOU STOOD
THERE LIKE A STRONG GIRL AND I'M
GOING TO MAKE YOU DINNER.
 SO THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS
THAT WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTES
BETWEEN DEBBIE AND AUBRY, AND SO
IF THERE'S AN ADOLL BEING
PLAYED, WE'LL GET THAT OUT OF
THE WAY, BUT DEBBIE SHOULD BE
GOING HOME.
AND AUBRY IS IN A WEAK POSITION.
SO SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.
IT SHOULD BE ME, AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT I THINK.
 WHAT'S YOUR GUYS PLAN WITH
DEBBIE AND JOE?
 I'M WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO
TELL US WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON BECAUSE WE'RE CLEARLY LIKE
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMERO UNO.
 THAT'S OBVIOUS.
WE ARE SPLITTING THE VOTE.
THAT'S ALL THE BRAWN AND ALL THE
BEAUTY.
AND WE'RE SPLITTING IT 4-3.
 4-3.
 BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER TWO
BRAINS.
SO YOU NEED TO MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISION IN VOTING FOR DEBBIE OR
JOE, MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO
VOTE FOR DEBBIE, BUT I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING.
I KNOW THAT'S THE POSITION
YOU'RE IN, BUT I HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND I KNOW I'M ACTING ARROGANT
AND ALL THAT STUFF, BUT...
 AT LEAST YOU ADMIT IT.
 THIS IS NOT TYPICAL OF ME TO
REVEAL MY TRUE SELF, BUT, HEY,
IF NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF AUBRY,LY.
WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR WEAKEST, I'M
RIGHT THERE FOR YOU.
AND SHE KNOWS IT.
BUT SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
IT.
NOT RIGHT NOW.
 OKAY.
 THIS IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
NICK'S ARROGANCE IS GETTING THE
BEST OF HIM.
HE'S SO CONFIDENT HE'S
RIDICULOUS.
NICK IS GETTING TOO BIG FOR HIS
BRITCHES.
HE JUST RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY.
 SO WHAT ARE YOU ALL THINKING?
OUR NUMBERS ARE EQUAL, FIVE
WOMEN AND MEN.
 WE NEED TO STRIKE NOW.
 YOU WANT THE TAKE NICK OUT?
 YES.
 I KNEW THAT.
 I KIND OF GUESSED THAT.
 HE NEEDS TO GO NOW.
 I LIKE THE IDEA OF IT BEING
NICK.
 LO AND BEHOLD, CYDNEY
APPROACHES ME AND AUBRY AND
SAYS, LET'S TAKE OUT NICK.
I WAS STILL KIND OF HOPING NICK
WOULD COME AROUND AND WE COULD
TAKE OUT JASON OR SCOT, BUT
NICK, THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE
WORM.
 I'M IN COMPLETELY.
I'M COMMITTED.
AUBRY, YOU?
 I'M IN.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SAY.
 IT'S A DONE DEAL, GIRL.
 MY BEST INTEREST IS TO MAKE
URE ALL THE GIRLS STAYS AS CLOSE
AS POSSIBLE.
IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR ME TO BE
IN A GAME WITH ALL WOMEN.
IF IT BACKFIRE, OH, WELL, I'LL
BE THE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE A
MOVE IN THIS GAME.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL?
DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT?
 ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME?
 HE LIKES TO CHECK IN ON ME.
 I NOTICED.
 HE'S LIKE WE'LL GO WITH THE
PLAN.
I'M LIKE, NICK, NOTHING'S
CHANGED.
 YOU DOWN TO VOTE NICK
TONIGHT?
 NICK?
 YES.
 I ALREADY GOT THEM.
 GOOD.
 CYDNEY WOULD LIKE TO GET NICK
OUT.
SHE THINKS HE'S A THREAT.
AND I AGREE.
BUT HE'S ALSO IN MY ALLIANCE,
AND I DO THINK THAT I COULD WORK
WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT LONGER, SO
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT REALLY
WORKS FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK WE SHOULD ALL STICK
TOGETHER.
 I AGREE.
 THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO GO
WITH DEBBIE BEING OUT, SO THERE
ARE A LOT OF CHOICES AT THIS
POINT.
AND IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
REALLY WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ME AND
JULIA.
 WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE.
 YOU DEFINITELY FEEL THE
ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR BEFORE
TRIBAL.
THERE IS A POWER STRUGGLE
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S REALLY EVIDENT IN CAMP.
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG EGO, A LOT
OF PERSONALITY.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING AT SOME POINT THAT'S
GOING TO MAKE THE TWO OF US GET
THE POWER.
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A MOVE
THAT DOES SOLIDIFY MY TITLE AS
SOMEBODY WHO EARNED IT.
AND IT'S ALL FIGURING OUT
TIMING.
 Jeff: NICK AND MICHELE, GO
AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOU FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE FIRST
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
NEAL, WHO WAS PULLED FROM THE
GAME BY OUR MEDICAL TEAM.
SEEMED WELL ENOUGH TO COME BE
WITH US TONIGHT FOR TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
SO, MICHELE, AVOIDING TRIBAL FOR
22 DAYS IS THE BEST THING YOU
COULD EVER HOPE FOR, AND YET
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING ABOUT
COMING HERE THAT KIND OF STIRS
THE "SURVIVOR" JUICES.
 YEAH.
YOU GO 22 DAYS WITHOUT TRIBAL
AND THAT'S GREAT, BUT YOU'RE NOT
REALLY SHOWING HOW YOU'RE
PLAYING THE GAME OR WHAT KIND OF
PLAYER YOU ARE UNTIL YOU'RE ON
THESE SEATS AT TRIBAL.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, WHAT DID YOU
NOTICE WHEN THIS GROUP FINALLY
CAME TOGETHER AT THE MERGE?
 INITIALLY UNSURE.
NOW IT SEEMS LIKE BRAIN, BRAWN,
BEAUTY HAVE ACTUALLY STAYED
DISTINCT BUT THAT BRAWN AND
BEAUTY HAVE ACTUALLY NOW MERGED.
 Jeff: NICK, THAT WAS A
COMMENT THAT CAME UP TODAY,
WHICH WAS A BRAIN IS GOING HOME.
 HEY, THE BRAINS ARE ON THE
OUTS, AND WE'LL BE SPLITTING THE
VOTE AND WE'LL BE MOVING ON FROM
THERE.
 Jeff: SO AUBRY, WHO IS
TOGETHER?
 NICK, MICHELE, JASON, CYDNEY,
SCOT, TAI AND JULIA.
AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND
TODAY FEELING HIGHLY ANXIOUS
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING I CAN
DO TO GET MOVEMENT OUT OF THEM.
 Jeff: AND YET, JULIA, THIS
WOULD BE A GREAT TIME FOR
SOMEBODY TO MAKE A MOVE, BECAUSE
IN THAT SEVEN, SOMEBODY'S ON THE
BOTTOM.
 WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO
FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE RIGHT
NOW, AND I THINK THERE ARE
ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE
TO SWITCH THINGS UP LATER ON.
 Jeff: JASON, THAT'S THE
FEAR, ISN'T IT, THAT YOU HAVE
THIS GREAT PLAN, AS LONG AS
EVERYBODY STICKS WITH IT.
 YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SAYING
IT FOR THREE DAYS -- WE STAY
STRONG, WE'RE GUARANTEED TO GO
TO SEVEN AND WE BATTLE IT OUT
FROM THERE.
AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE
ALLIANCE HAS WENT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
 Jeff: SCOT, HOW DO YOU MAKE
SURE THE SEVEN STAY TOGETHER?
 YOU DON'T HAVE SIX DAYS IN
BETWEEN TRIBAL.
 Jeff: THAT REALLY DID
CHANGE THE FLOW?
 YEAH.
IT WAS ROUGH.
A LOT OF THOUGHTS WERE PONDERED,
BUT THE GAME STARTED BACK UP
AGAIN TODAY.
WE'RE HERE TONIGHT.
AND HONESTLY, I REALLY THINK OUR
SEVEN IS PRETTY STRONG.
 Jeff: TAI, HAVE THERE BEEN
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IDOLS AND
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL COME INTO
PLAY?
 YEAH, WE DIDN'T THINK THERE
WAS AN IDOL UNTIL THE MERGE.
WE FIGURE MAYBE NEAL HAD THE
IDOL, AND WE HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SUPERIDOL, AS WELL.
AND WHEN TWO IDOLS MASTERING
TOGETHER AND BECOME A SUPERIDOL,
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THAT AFTER
THE VOTE.
 Jeff: WELL, YOU SAY "WE"
AND JULIA HAS NO IDEA.
SHE JUST WRENCHED HER ENTIRE
NECK TURNING BACK TOWARD YOU.
 I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW.
 Jeff: AUBRY, WHY THE BIG
REACTION?
 SHE'S OUT OF THE LOOP ON
THAT.
MAYBE THAT'S AN INDICATOR OF
WHERE THINGS REALLY LIE?
 JEFF, SOMEBODY IS ON THE
BOTTOM, AND THAT SUPERIDOL AND
YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, IF THAT
DOESN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT
YOU CLEARLY ARE ON THE BOTTOM,
AND YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING,
THERE IS STILL TIME TO DO IT
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: TAI, YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD AT THIS.
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU?
 I MEAN, I WAS TOLD ABOUT THE
SUPERIDOL.
NOW I'M THINKING MAYBE THE
PERSON SAID SOMETHING TO ME TO
MAKE ME FEEL SUSPICIOUS OF
WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'M JUST THINKING HERE, WOW, AM
I BEING A FOOL?
 Jeff: SO DEBBIE, HEARING
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID
TONIGHT, ANY HOPE?
 OH, I ALWAYS HAVE HOPE.
ABSOLUTELY.
OFTENTIMES THERE IS MORE NOT
REVEALED HERE THAN THERE IS
REVEALED HERE.
 Jeff: AUBRY, HOW ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU EXPECT VOTES TONIGHT?
 OH, YEAH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.
 Jeff: SCOT, WILL BIT A
BLINDSIDE TONIGHT, OR AS
PREDICTED?
 I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WILL GO
ANY OTHER WAY THAN AS PREDICTED.
 Jeff: OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TAI, YOU'RE UP.
 SORRY, GIRL.
IT'S A SPLIT.
 SEE YOU LATER, DEBBIE.
IT'S BEEN FUN.
 OVERCONFIDENCE IS A WEAKNESS.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
AUBRY.
DEBBIE.
NICK.
AUBRY.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
JASON.
NICK.
TWO VOTES NICK, TWO VOTES AUBRY,
ONE VOTE DEBBIE, ONE VOTE JASON.
NICK.
THAT'S THREE VOTES NICK.
NICK.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES NICK.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
ONE VOTE DEBBIE, ONE VOTE JASON.
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT, SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY, NICK.
THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
NICK, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 SEE YA.
 Jeff: WELL, IT IS ONE OF
THE HALLMARKS OF THIS GAME, AS
LONG AS YOU KEEP FIGHTING,
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT
"SURVIVOR," AFTER A BLINDSIDE,
THE MEN SEEK VENGEANCE.
 WE TOOK THE AX, WE TOOK THE
MACHETE.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO STARVE
THEM.
 IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.
 Jeff: AND IT TEARS THE
WOMEN APART.
 JULIA IS PLAYING BOTH SIDES,
BUT SOMETIMES THE GUY IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD GETS RUN
OVER.
 FIRST AND LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, OF COURSE IT TURNS OUT
TO BE BITTERSWEET, AND I DESERVE
IT.
I WAS BEYOND CONFIDENT.
THIS WAS A BLINDINGSIDE FOR
SURE.
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT THEY WERE
PULLING.
I HAVE TO GIVE THEM PROPS FOR
THAT.
I'LL STILL BE OVERCONFIDENT AND
COCKY AND ARROGANT, BUT I SHOULD
HAVE PUNCHED BEFORE THEY DID AND
I JUST DIDN'T.
THAT'S ALL.
