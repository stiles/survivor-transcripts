         Jeff: WE ARE LIVE IN LOS
ANGELES AT CBS FOR THE TWO-HOUR
SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR:
BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS
BEAUTY."
WE HAVE THE ENTIRE GROUP OF
PLAYERS HERE.
TAKE A LOOK.
THEY'VE WAITED A LONG TIME.
THEY'RE VERY EXCITED.
IT'S THE CONCLUSION TO A CRAZY
SEASON WITH REALLY WEIRD MUSIC
RIGHT NOW THAT I LIKE.
IT WAS A SEASON FULL OF
UNDERDOGS THAT SAW A RECORD
NUMBER OF MEDICAL EVACUATIONS.








THERE WERE THREE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS THAT WERE NOT PLAYED AND
MARK, THE CHICKEN, THE FIRST
CHICKEN IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR" TO COME THIS FAR
WITHOUT GETTING COOKED.
TAKE A LOOK.
I HAVE FRIENDS.
IT IS A PACKED HOUSE HERE AT
CBS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S A HARD TICKET TO GET, AND
IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN NIGHT.
WE ALSO STILL HAVE ANOTHER FIRST
TO COME IN THIS FINALE.
IT'S A NEW TWIST, AND FOR ONE
PLAYER, IT COULD BE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING AND
LOSING THIS GAME.
ALL RIGHT.
JOIN IN ON THE FUN.
HIT US UP ON TWITTER
#SURVIVORFINALE.








LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WAIT FOR, THREE
HOURS OF "SURVIVOR."
IT'S YOUR LAST FIX BEFORE FALL.
HERE WE GO!
35 DAYS AGO 18 AMERICANS
REPRESENTING BRAINS, BRAWN, AND
BEAUTY STARTED THE ADVENTURE OF
A LIFETIME.
BUT THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW
DIFFICULT IT WOULD MOVE TO BE.
-- PROVE TO BE.
THE SWELTERING HEAT LED TO
DEHYDRATION.
 HEAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE
BIGGEST FACTORS IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AND HEAT STROKE.
SEE THE EXHAUSTION.
MEDICAL.
IT BROUGHT DOWN EVEN THE
STRONGEST OF COMPETITORS.
CALL FOR THE CHOPPER.
AND LED TO A RECORD NUMBER OF
EVACUATIONS.
 HAVE FUN.
 THANK YOU.
 BYE.
 Jeff: THE SEARCH FOR IDOLS
WAS ALSO PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING.
 IT'S NOT EASY.
 Jeff: AND AT TIMES AN
ALL-OUT BATTLE.
 I GOT IT, SCOT.
 Jeff: TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
EQUALLY RELENTLESS.
 ORIGINAL PLAN.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: THIS GAME IS ALIVE.
IDOLS...
 I'VE GOT AN IDOL.
 THAT'S AN IDOL.
 WAIT A MINUTE.
THE IDOL'S GOT A BROTHER.
 Jeff: AND ADVANTAGES...
 I CAN ADD ANOTHER VOTE TO ANY
TRIBAL.
 Jeff: LED TO A SERIES OF
SHOCKING VOTES.
 VOTE NUMBER TWO.
 Jeff: AND DEVASTATING BLIND
SIDES.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
IT'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST SEASON IN
THE HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR," AND
IT'S NOT OVER YET.
ONLY FOUR REMAIN.
MICHELE, LOYALTY HAS BEEN HER
STRONGEST ASSET, YET CYDNEY IS
THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T BETRAYED
HER.
 I'M GOING TO DO MY DAMMEDDEST
TO GET THEM OFF YOUR BACK.
 Jeff: WITH TRUST IN SHORT
SUPPLY, SHE WILL HAVE TO GET TO
THE END ON HER OWN.
 I'M GOING TO PUT EVERYTHING
ON THE LINE.
I'M A JERSEY GIRL, AND YOU GOT
TO GET SCRAPPY SOMETIMES.
IF I HAVE THE FIGHT DIRTY, THEN
I WILL.
 Jeff: AUBRY, SHE LOST HER
TWO BIGGEST ALLIES, NEAL AND
JOE, TO MEDICAL EVACUATION, BUT
SHE REFUSES TO GIVE UP.
DOES SHE HAVE ENOUGH IN THE TANK
TO GET TO THE END?
 "SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN FLIPPING
ME AROUND, TRYING TO TOSS ME OFF
LIKE I'M IN A RODEO, BUT THE ONE
THING I HAVE TO DO IN THIS GAME
IS TO WIN.
IT'S NOT ABOUT SMOKE AND MIRRORS
ANYMORE.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, DO YOU
HAVE MEAT AND POTATOES ON YOUR
PLATE?
I THINK I DO.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, SHE'S
ORCHESTRATED NUMEROUS BLIND
SIDES.
 LET'S STRIKE NOW.
 YOU WANT THE TAKE NICK OUT?
 YES.
 Jeff: BUT SHE'LL HAVE TO
NAVIGATE MULTIPLE ALLIANCES TO
AVOID BEING BLIND SIDED.
 I'M NOT INTIMIDATED BY
ANYBODY OR ANYTHING.
IT'S ALWAYS DO OR DIE.
YOU PUT SO MUCH WORK IN ON THE
FRONT END, THAT YOU WANT TO REAP
REWARD ON THE BACK END.
 Jeff: TAI SPENT MOST OF THE
GAME IN THE POWER POSITION, BUT
WITH HIS IDOL AND ADVANTAGE
GONE, HE'S NOW VULNERABLE FOR
THE FIRST TIME.
 I HAVE THIS WAR INSIDE ME,
THE HEART AND THE BRAIN.
I'M GOING TO GO AS FAR AS I CAN
WITH MY HEART, BUT AT SOME POINT
MY BRAIN HAS TO KICK IN BECAUSE
ULTIMATELY IT'S A GAME.
 Jeff: WHO WILL HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO OUTWITHWIT, OUTPLAY AND
OUTLAST ALL THE REST TO WIN THE
$1 MILLION AND THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR?
 SHUT UP.
THAT'S NOT REAL.
[CHICKEN CLUCKING]
IT'S TOO EARLY.
 DON'S CROWING AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT CHICKENS DO.
HE'S WAKING RIGHT NOW.
EVERYBODY IS TIRED.
I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANYBODY
UPSET AT CHICKEN, BECAUSE
CHICKEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH ME
DIRECTLY.
RIGHT NOW IT'S COMING AT SUCH A
DELICATE TIME.
ANYTHING, HOWEVER SMALL, CAN
UPSET PEOPLE, AND WITH JOE BEING
GONE, THE GAME JUST SWITCHED
AGAIN.
I KNOW I HAVE AUBRY, BUT TWO
AGAINST TWO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MY FATE.
I CAN'T USE MY IDOL ANYMORE.
THE IDOL IS ONLY USED FOR FIVE.
I FEEL VULNERABLE.
I HAVE TO BE REALLY, REALLY
CAREFUL.
OTHERWISE I MIGHT NOT BE AT THE
INAL, AND I I JUST CANNOT AFFORD
THAT.
GOOD MORNING.
HOW YOU DOING?
DID YOU SLEEP IN
 I ACTUALLY DID SLEEP.
I MADE MYSELF.
EVERY TIME JEFF ARRIVES ON THE
BEACH, MY CLOSEST ALLY GOES
HOME.
LIKE DEÉJAÀ VU ALL OVER AGAIN.
 IT'S SAD THAT JOE LEFT, BUT
WE STILL COULD STAY TOGETHER AND
MAKE FRIENDS.
WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET CLOSE TO
HER.
 Jeff:
 I WILL.
CYDNEY AND I HAVE HAD A REALLY
GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP THE
WHOLE GAME.
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON EVERY
VOTE.
SO I'M GOING THE KEEP UP HAUTE
THAT -- HOPE THAT MAYBE ME,
CYDNEY AND TAI CAN MAKE IT
HAPPEN.
I THINK MICHELE HAS BUILT
RELATIONSHIPS AND SHE'S VERY
CONSISTENT.
SHE'S THE BIGGEST SOCIAL THREAT
IN THIS GAME.
MICHELE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO
HAS NOT PISSED OFF ANYONE ON
THAT JURY.
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO HAS BUILT VERY
CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,
AND THAT'S A SCARY THING TO ME.
WE CAN DO IT.
 I THINK WE CAN.
 I JUST FEEL LIKE IF TAI WINS
AND I DON'T, I FEEL LIKE I'M
SCREWED.
AUBRY DEFINITELY WANTED TO GO TO
THE END WITH YOU.
 BUT WITH YOU, TOO, THOUGH
 I KNOW.
 THE TRIANGLE THING?
 YEAH.
 I FEEL LIKE NO MATTER WHAT,
MOVING FORWARD WITH YOU IS WHAT
I WANT TO DO.
 MY FIRST THOUGHT AFTER JOE
LEFT IS I'M IN A GOOD PLACE.
NOW I'M IN A BETTER PLACE
BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY WANTS TO
TAKE ME TO THE END.
I JUST NEED THE MAKE SURE THAT I
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THREE AND
I'LL FIGHT MY WAY OUT FROM
THERE.
 I'M LIKING US THREE GIRLS.
 ME TOO.
 THAT'S JUST WHAT'S BEST FOR
US.
 NOW THAT JOE IS PULLED FROM
THE GAME.
ALLIANCES START RESHIFTING.
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO SCRAMBLE
FOR POWER.
THE BEAUTY OF THIS GAME IS YOU
NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
AND EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ANYONE'S GAME IF YOU MY YOU
CARDS RIGHT.
IT'S ANYONE'S GAME IF YOU MY YOU
CARDS RIGHT.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY THE GET TO
TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES, JEFF.
 Jeff: AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING ON
YOUR MIND, GETTING TO THE END.
TODAY'S CHALLENGE OFFERS YOU AN
OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LITTLE
CLOSER TO THAT GOAL.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: ON MY GO
YOU'RE GOING TO RACE UNDER A
NET.
YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOU WAY TO A
TABLE WHERE YOU WILL SLIDE TILES
INTO TARGET.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE TILES,
YOU'LL USE MACHETE TO TRANSPORT
THEM THROUGH A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES TO A FINISH TABLE.
YOU'LL THEN SORT THE TILES INTO
PAIRS, THREE OF THE TILES WILL
NOT MATCH UP.
THOSE THREE TILES HOLD THE
COMBINATION TO UNLOCK A BOX.
FIRST PERSON TO UNLOCK THEIR BOX
AND RAISE THEIR FLAG WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
CHALLENGE WILL BE TREATED TO A
MEAL DESIGNED TO REFUEL NOT ONLY
YOUR SPIRIT BUT YOUR BODY.
STEAK, VEGETABLE, REFRESHING
DRINK AND A FROM TEEN BAR WHICH
YOU NEED.
ALL RIGHT
WE'RE GOING TO DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
ATTACK IT.
GET UNDER THIS THING.
MICHELE SLOWING DOWN.
TAI IN THE EARLY LEAD.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
GO, TAI, GO!
AUBRY IS OUT.
START MOVING THOSE TILES.
HERE COMES MICHELE.
NOW IT'S CYDNEY TAKING A LOT OF
TIME.
CYDNEY NOW HEADING OUT.
MICHELE HEADING OUT.
EVERY TIME YOU HEAR A GONG,
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
THAT MEANS IT WENT STRAIGHT DOWN
INTO YOUR GOOD PILE.
EVERY TILE HAS TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THE CENTER TARGET.
IF NOT YOU HAVE TO PICK THEM UP,
COME BACK AND FINISH.
AUBRY GOING TO PICK HERS UP NOW
TO TRY AGAIN.
ANY THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT, YOU
HAVE TO COLLECT, BRING BACK AND
KEEP FIRING.
MICHELE HAVING A VERY SLOW GO OF
IT.
AUBRY EVEN WORSE.
CYDNEY UNSTOPPABLE RIGHT NOW.
THERE IT IS, CYDNEY.
CYDNEY HAS ALL HERS.
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO STACK ON
YOUR MACHETE AS MANY AS YOU
THINK YOU CAN COMFORTABLY CARRY
THROUGH THE OBSTACLES.
AUBRY NOW PICKING UP THE PACE.
CYDNEY MAKING HER FIRST GO OVER
THE BALANCE BEAM CARRYING ONLY
FOUR TILES, AND SHE DROPS.
CYDNEY HAS TO GO BACK AND START
AGAIN.
THERE IT IS FOR AUBRY.
SHE'S GOT ALL HERS.
SHE CAN START STACKING.
TAI DOWN TO HIS LAST ONE.
THERE IT IS.
TAI CAN START STACKING NOW.
CYDNEY DUMPS.
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK AGAIN,
EVENING THIS UP.
IT IS NOW AUBRY IN THE LEAD.
SHE'S MAKING QUICK WORK.
SHE HAS A STACK OF FIVE.
HERE COMES CYDNEY AGAIN.
AUBRY DOES IT.
NICE JOB.
HEAD BACK.
THERE IT IS, MICHELE.
START STACKING.
AUBRY DOES IT.
NICE JOB.
YOU'RE CLEAR.
GOOD.
AUBRY HEADING BACK FOR MORE.
IT IS NOW AUBRY IN THE LEAD.
THE ONLY PERSON WITH TILES BACK
ON HER FINISH TABLE.
HERE COMES CYDNEY.
CAN SHE DO IT THIS TIME.
NO.
CYDNEY DROPS AGAIN.
HERE COMES TAI WITH TILES.
NO, MICHELE.
YOU MISSED.
YOU GOT TO GO BACK.
AUBRY ONCE AGAIN PAIRLY IS CLOSE
TO FALLING BUT DOESN'T.
IT IS NOW AUBRY RUNNING AWAY
WITH IT.
CAN ANYBODY CATCH HER?
HERE COMES TAI.
TAI DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO HEAD BACK.
MICHELE IS BACK WITH HER FIRST
TILES.
HERE COMES AUBRY WITH HER LAST
THREE TILES.
AUBRY, GOOD.
START PAIRING THEM UP.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PAIRS.
EVERY TIME YOU FIND A PAIR, PUT
IT TOGETHER.
THAT WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THREE
THAT DON'T MATCH.
THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS YOU NEED.
CYDNEY FOR THE FIRST TIME IS
ACROSS.
MAYBE CYDNEY CAN GET SOME
MOMENTUM.
AUBRY PAIRING UP, LOOK FOR THE
THREE THAT DON'T MATCH.
ONCE YOU THINK YOU HAVE THEM,
THOSE THREE NUMBERS ARE WHAT YOU
NEED TO UNLOCK THE BOX.
CYDNEY WITH A HUGE FALL.
GOT TO PICK UP AND GO BACK.
MICHELE BACK SUCCESSFULLY WITH
TILES.
AUBRY HAS HER THREE.
SHE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
CYDNEY'S BACK WITH MORE TILES.
AUBRY TRIES.
DOES IT WORK?
IS SHE GOING TO TRY ANOTHER
COMBINATION?
TAI BACK WITH TILES.
HE'S GOOD.
TAI START HEADING BACK.
AUBRY TRYING AGAIN.
FORCING IT.
THERE ARE SIX POSSIBLE
COMBINATIONS.
IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBERS,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP
TRYING THEM.
TAI'S GOOD.
CYDNEY'S GOOD.
CYDNEY HAS ALL OF HER TILES NOW.
SHE CAN START PAIRING THEM UP.
AUBRY HAS BEEN TRYING SEVERAL
DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS.
NOTHING WORKING.
MICHELE'S ACROSS WITH MORE
TILES.
LET'S GO, MICHELE.
KEEP MOVING.
TAI COMING BACK WITH HIS LAST
TILES.
YOU'RE GOOD, TAI.
START WORKING ON YOUR PAIRS.
IT IS NOW AUBRY, CYDNEY AND TAI
ALL TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
IT IS NOW AUBRY, CYDNEY AND TAI
ALL TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
AUBRY FINALLY DISCOVERS HER
PROBLEM.
ONE OF THE PAIRS NOT MATCHED UP
CORRECTLY, WHICH MEANS THE
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN WRONG THIS
ENTIRE TIME.
IT IS NOW ANYBODY'S GAME TO WIN.
MICHELE IS NOW BACK.
SHE'S PAIRING UP.
AUBRY MAKES A CHANGE.
IS SHE RIGHT THIS TIME?
CYDNEY RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
TAI HAS A SHOT.
HE'S GOING FOR IT.
WHO WILL GET THERE FIRST?
AUBRY, CYDNEY OR TAI?
TAI COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE.
NO.
TAI'S WRONG.
CYDNEY'S WRONG.
YES!
AUBRY WINS REWARD.
BIG ADVANTAGE IN THE NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
GOOD JOB.
WOW.
WHAT AN EFFORT.
AUBRY, COME ON OVER.
HUGE EFFORT, YOUR FIRST
INDIVIDUAL WIN.
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
 IT FEELS SO GOOD, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, AUBRY, SO
HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE, A MEAL
DESIGNED TO REFUEL YOUR BODY.
IF YOU WANT, I WILL DOUBLE IT
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BRING ONE
PERSON.
IF YOU BRING ONE PERSON,
OBVIOUSLY YOU RISK ALIENATING
TWO OTHERS, AND IF YOU BRING ONE
PERSON, YOU MAY BE FUELING THEIR
BODY TO HELP THEM BEAT YOU AT
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND
POSSIBLY VOTE YOU OUT THAT
NIGHT?
 I'M GOING TO GO WITH CYDNEY.
 Jeff: COME ON OVER, CYDNEY.
ALL RIGHT.
FOOD WILL BE DELIVERED, TWO
MEALS.
ENJOY THEM.
YOU EARNED THEM.
MICHELE AND TAI, GOT NOTHING FOR
YOU.
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR STUFF AND
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
NICE JOB.
 THANKS, JEFF.
WINNING THE REWARD CHALLENGE WAS
VERY IMPORTANT.
WITH JOE GONE, I NEED TO MAKE
SURE I'M ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
THE VOTE.
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO HAVE THE
TRUST OF CYDNEY.
THAT MEAL HAD TO GO TO CYDNEY.
IN ORDER TO UP MY CHANCES THAT
WE COULD BEAT MICHELE AT THE
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
 TODAY IT FINALLY HAPPENED.
NO ONE WAS GOING TO BEAT ME.
IT WAS MY TIME TO WIN A
CHALLENGE.
I WANTED CYDNEY TO BE FED AND IN
A BETTER PLACE TO WIN THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE TOMORROW.
THIS IMMUNITY CHALLENGE MEANS
EVERYTHING.
WE DON'T WANT MICHELE TO WIN.
 I HOPE IT'S ONE OF OUR TIMES
TOMORROW.
 ABSOLUTELY.
I'M ON THE SAME PAGE.
 WHEN AUBRY CHOSE ME, IT
SOLIDIFIES THE TIME.
IT BUILDS ON OUR RELATIONSHIP
AND IT JUST HELPS US TRUST EACH
OTHER MORE.
 I'M FEELING A GOOD MENTAL
STATE, THE BEST I'VE FELT.
 THAT'S ONE THING ABOUT THE
FINAL CHALLENGES.
THEY'RE LONG.
SO ANYTHING, RUNNING AND
ENDURANCE-WISE, ME AND YOU
SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD ON THAT
ONE.
RIGHT NOW I HAVE TWO ALLIANCES.
MY IDEAL OPTION WOULD BE MYSELF
AUBRY AND TAI, AND THEN THE
SECOND OPTION WOULD BE MICHELE,
AUBRY AND MYSELF.
THERE'S DEFINITELY A TRICK TO
BEING IN THE MIDDLE.
I'M JUST HOPING THAT EVERYBODY
STICKS TRUE TO THEIR WORD.
I CAN JUST PICK AND MOVE
WHEREVER I THINK IS BEST.
 LISTEN, I HAVE AN IDEA.
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU LOSE, THE
GIRLS WANT TO GET YOU OUT.
OR ME OUT.
DEPENDING.
 YEAH, ONE OF US.
 BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE, THEY'RE
GOING TO TRY AND CONVINCE ME TO
VOTE YOU.
IF I LOSE, THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
AND CONVINCE YOU TO VOTE ME.
WE MIGHT AS WELL GET TOGETHER
AND TRY AND VOTE ONE OF THEM.
I THINK AUBRY MADE A REALLY POOR
CHOICE OF HER REWARD CHALLENGE.
SHE CHOSE CYDNEY LAST TIME AND
LEFT ME AND TAI ON THE OUTS, AND
THEN SHE GETS THE REWARD TODAY
AND SHE CHOOSES CYDNEY AGAIN.
THAT MADE ME THINK, WELL, I HAVE
TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A
BACK-UP PLAN.
IT TOOK AUBRY WINNING TO KICK ME
IN THE ASS AND MAKE ME START
THINKING A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF
THE BOX.
THEY HAVE EVERY SINGLE BIT OF
CONTROL.
WE NEED TO BAND TOGETHER AND
TAKE OUR OWN CONTROL.
I THINK AUBRY IS THE BIGGER
TARGET, SO IF ONE OF US WIN, WE
GO AUBRY.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?
 I LIKE IT.
 LET'S SHAKE ON IT.
WILLING?
 I'M NOT GIVING UP ON AUBRY,
BUT I STILL HIGH GO WITH
MICHELE'S PLAN.
THAT'S DEFINITELY AN OPTION, AT
LEAST AN OPTION.
I HAVE TO THINK, AM I BETTER TO
BE AT THE END WITH HER SITTING
NEXT TO ME OR WITH AUBRY?
IF I HAVE TO BETRAY MY TRUE
ALLIANCE, I'LL BETRAY MY TRUE
ALLIANCE.
ULTIMATELY I WANT THE MILLION
DOLLARS AT ANY COST.
ULTIMATELY I WANT THE MILLION
DOLLARS AT ANY COST.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CYDNEY.
GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE OUT INTO THE
OCEAN AND RETRIEVE A KEY.
YOU'LL USE THAT KEY TO UNLOCK A
SET OF STAIRS.
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, YOU'LL
FIND A SECOND KEY.
YOU'LL HEAD BACK OUT INTO THE
WATER AND USE THAT KEY TO UNLOCK
A BALL ATTACHED TO A ROPE.
YOU'LL USE THE BALL TO DROP A
LADDER.
AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER YOU
WILL FIND A THIRD KEY.
HEAD OUT ONE LAST TIME, AND USE
THAT KEY TO RELEASE A POLE.
YOU'LL USE THE POLE TO KNOCK OFF
THE BAG OF PUDDLE PIECES, AND
YOU WILL USE THE PUZZLE PIECES
TO SOLVE A THREE-LEVEL PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A ONE IN THREE SHOT
AT WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSER AFTER 37 DAYS WILL BECOME
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED SPOT IN
THE FINAL THREE, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO!
THIS IS GOING THE TAKE
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ON DAY 37.
CYDNEY FIRST TO THE LADDER.
THEN AUBRY, TAI, MICHELE.
GET THAT FIRST KEY AND GET BACK.
AUBRY HAS HER FIRST KEY.
MICHELE HAS HER FIRST KEY.
TAI COMING DOWN.
CYDNEY TAKING A LONG TIME ON
THOSE KNOTS.
IT IS AUBRY ONCE AGAIN FULL TILT
BOOGIE ON THIS.
UNLOCK THOSE CHAIRS AND GET TO
THE TOP SO YOU CAN GET YOUR NEXT
KEY.
AUBRY HAS HER LOCK UNDONE.
TAI HAS HIS UNDONE.
LET'S GO.
KEEP MOVING.
TAI LOOKING FOR HIS SECOND KEY.
AUBRY LOOKING FOR HER SECOND
KEY.
CYDNEY HAS HER LOCK UNDONE.
MICHELE HAS HERS UNDONE.
EVERYBODY IS IN THIS.
37 DAYS IN, IMMUNITY ON THE
LINE.
AUBRY COMING BACK DOWN.
TAI RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
MICHELE HAS HER KEY.
CYDNEY HAS HER KEY.
KEEP MOVING.
YOU WANT TO GET TO THREE, YOU
GOT TO LEAVE IT ALL RIGHT HERE.
AUBRY WORKING ON THAT SECOND
LOCK.
SHE'S GOT HER BAG.
TAI WORKING ON HIS SECOND.
AUBRY IN THE LEAD.
DID THAT FOOD MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
CYDNEY HAS HERS.
MICHELE HAS HER SECOND KEY.
TAI STRUGGLING.
AUBRY BACK FIRST.
CYDNEY RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
HERE COMES MICHELE.
NOW YOU GOT A BALL ATTACHED TO A
ROPE.
YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT BALL TO
RELEASE YOUR LADDER.
HERE COMES TAI.
HE'S LOST A LOT OF TIME.
CYDNEY ALL KNOTTED UP.
IT'S ALL ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW
THE USE YOUR ROPE.
AUBRY LASSOS IT.
RELEASE THAT LADDER.
GO, AUBRY!
AUBRY HEADING FOR HER THIRD AND
FINAL KEY.
TAI JUST MISSES.
TAI SCORES IT WITH HIS SECOND
TOSS.
DROP YOUR LADDER.
AUBRY HAS HER THIRD KEY.
SHE'S HEADING DOWN.
TAI HEADING UP FOR HIS THIRD
KEY.
CYDNEY KNOCKS IT DOWN.
MICHELE'S GOT IT.
MICHELE TRYING TO STAY IN THIS.
AUBRY WITH A MASSIVE LEAD RIGHT
NOW.
CAN ANYBODY CATCH HER?
TAI HAS HIS THIRD KEY.
HERE COMES CYDNEY.
HERE COMES MICHELE.
AUBRY HAS HER THIRD KEY
UNLOCKED.
SHE'S NOW LOOKING FOR THAT BAG
OF PUZZLE PIECES.
SHE'S JUST GOT TO KNOCK OFF THAT
BAG.
THAT'S PROVING DIFFICULT.
TAI AND CYDNEY CATCHING UP.
AUBRY HAS HER BAG OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
SHE CAN HEAD BACK.
YOU WANT TO BE SAFE, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET IMMUNITY.
CYDNEY HAS HER LOCK DONE.
CYDNEY HAS THE POLE RELEASED.
CYDNEY HAS HER BAG OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
AUBRY IS BACK FIRST WITH HER
PUZZLE PIECES.
CYDNEY RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
HERE COMES TAI WITH HIS PUZZLE
PIECES.
MICHELE HAS HER BAG OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
AUBRY FIRST TO HER PUZZLE.
CYDNEY GASPING FOR AIR BUT STILL
FIGHTING.
HERE COMES TAI, BARELY ABLE TO
MOVE.
MICHELE DIGGING THOSE FEET
THROUGH THE SAND.
37 DAYS, YOU GOT TO LEAVE IT ALL
RIGHT HERE.
CYDNEY UP.
SHE CAN START WORKING ON HER
PUZZLE.
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A
THREE-PUZZLE, SIX PEDESTALS ALL
THE SAME SIZE.
ONCE YOU HAVE IT YOU CAN MOVE TO
THE NEXT LEVEL.
MICHELE BACK WITH HER BAG OF
PUZZLE PIECES.
AUBRY HAS HAD A BIG LEAD
THROUGHOUT THIS CHALLENGE, BUT
PUZZLES SO OFTEN ARE THE
EQUALIZER.
EVERYBODY WORKING ON THE FIRST
OF THREE LEVELS.
YOU USE ALL OF YOUR LIGHTEST
COLOR FOR THE FIRST LEVEL THEN
DARKER THEN DARKEST.
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVEN.
IF FIVE ARE EVEN AND ONE IS NOT,
YOU'RE NOT RIGHT.
TAI'S GOT A LOT OF PIECES GOING.
IS HE CLOSE?
MICHELE GETTING CLOSER TO THAT
FIRST LEVEL.
THIS REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO SEE
VISUALLY.
YOU REALLY GOT TO BE THINKING
OUTSIDE THE BOX.
CYDNEY EYEBALLING HERS.
AUBRY ABSOLUTELY STUMPED.
TAI MAKING NICE WORK.
TAI HAS HIS FIRST LEVEL.
START WORKING ON THAT SECOND
LEVEL.
IT IS NOW TAI IN THE LEAD.
CYDNEY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
WHAT DID HE DO?
WILL THAT HELP?
MICHELE HAS BEEN DEAD LAST BUT
SHE'S MAKING A COMEBACK.
MICHELE HAS THE FIRST LEVEL.
IT IS NOW TAI AND MICHELE.
TAI CLOSE ON THAT SECOND LEVEL.
TAI NOW HAS HIS SECOND LEVEL.
TAI MOVING ON TO THE THIRD AND
FINAL LEVEL.
IT IS TAI THEN MICHELE.
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.
AUBRY AND CYDNEY STILL ON FIRST
LEVEL.
CYDNEY NOT EVEN IN THIS.
MICHELE PICKING UP THE PACE NOW
ON HER SECOND LEVEL.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE.
TAI STARTING ON HIS THIRD LEVEL.
TAI GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO
WINNING IMMUNITY.
MICHELE TRYING TO CATCH HIM.
TAI STARTING TO PICK UP HIS
PACE.
MICHELE GETTING CLOSER.
ONE MORE COLUMN FOR MICHELE AND
SHE'S GOT THE SECOND LEVEL.
SHE'S GOT IT.
MICHELE MOVING ON TO THE THIRD
LEVEL.
IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSE.
CAN MICHELE CATCH TAI?
TAI GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE
END.
STILL MAKING QUICK WORK.
MICHELE HAS THREE COLUMNS THE
SAME HEIGHT.
MICHELE'S GOT SOME MOW --
MOMENTUM NOW.
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE
COME-FROM-BEHIND FOR MICHELE.
SHE WAS IN LAST THIS ENTIRE
CHALLENGE.
MICHELE HAS A FIFTH COLUMN.
TIE MOVING PIECES AROUND.
TAI THINKS HE HAS IT, MAKING A
BIG, QUICK MOVING.
MICHELE GETTING CLOSER.
MICHELE HAS IT!
MICHELE WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE
FINAL THREE!
WOW.
NOBODY SAW THAT COMING.
MICHELE, COME ON OVER.
NICELY DONE.
MICHELE, CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: 37 DAYS IN.
YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE FINAL
THREE.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 37
DAYS, TAI, AUBRY, CYDNEY,
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT WILL
BECOME THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
ONE THING CERTAIN, IT WILL NOT
BE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 MICHELE WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY
BEEN THE EASY VOTE IF SHE HADN'T
WON, BUT SHE DID.
I HAVE TO COZY ON UP TO MICHELE
AND MAKE SURE SOMEONE ELSE GETS
THROWN UNDER THE BUS BEFORE
MYSELF.
THROWN UNDER THE BUS BEFORE
MYSELF.
 HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
 I JUST SAW IT.
I DON'T KNOW.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 IT FEELS SURREAL TO HAVE THE
NECKLACE ON AND KNOW THAT I'M IN
THE FINAL THREE.
TWO DAYS AGO NOBODY REALLY GAVE
A CRAP WHERE I STOOD, YOU KNOW,
LIKE I COULD HAVE BEEN GOING
HOME TONIGHT IF I DIDN'T WIN,
AND, YOU KNOW, NOW I FEEL THAT I
AM IN A POWER POSITION.
 MANGO?
 MANGO, YEAH.
 AUBRY ANDLY GO GET WATER.
 I'VE BUILT RELATIONSHIPS WITH
ALL THREE OF THESE PEOPLE, SO
IT'S GOING TO BE SAD TO SEE ONE
OF THEM GO, BUT THIS VOTE THAT
WILL DECIDE WHO I GO TO THE END
WITH, AND IF I PICK THE WRONG
PERSON, BOOM, THERE GOES $1
MILLION.
 WORST THING HAPPENED.
 WE'RE NOT GONE YET.
 THE BEST NEWS FOR YOUR GAME
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE TO STICK WITH
ME, BUT I THINK WE'RE OBVIOUSLY
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT.
TAI AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
GET CYDNEY TO COME WITH US AND
VOTE OUT MICHELE, BUT WITH
MICHELE WINNING IMMUNITY, WE
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TRY TO
TAKE OUT CYDNEY.
I'M GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL VERY
VULNERABLE, AND I NEED TAI MORE
THAN EVER RIGHT NOW.
IF WE STICK TOGETHER...
 TWO VOTES FOR CYDNEY AND TWO
VOTES FOR YOU.
 OR TWO VOTES FOR YOU.
AT THAT POINT WE MAKE FIRE.
 OKAY.
 BY MICHELE MIGHT BE GUNNING
FOR YOU.
 SHE MIGHT BE.
THE BEST WE CAN DO IS FORCE A
TIE AND THEN HAVE TO GO TO FIRE
MAKING, AND THAT'S REALLY SCARY,
PLUS TAI AND I HAVE BEEN LIKE A
ZIPPER THAT DOESN'T QUITE ZIP
THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME.
AND HE'S A TRICKY PERSON TO BE
IN BED WITH BECAUSE TAI SWITCHES
ON A DIME.
 YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE FIRE,
RIGHT?
 NOT VERY WELL.
 I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH IT.
 GRAB THE MAGNESIUM AND THEN
HIT IT.
 YEAH.
 TO BE HONEST, I'M GETTING
KIND OF A FUNKY VIBE, AND I
COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG, BUT I
HAVE A FEELING THAT HE MIGHT
TURN ON ME.
AND IF HE DOES, I'M SCREWED.
 WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND
WITH YOU.
YOUR NAME'S NOT GETTING WRITTEN
DOWN BY ME.
 YOU KNOW MY VOTE GOES WHERE
YOUR VOTE GOES.
IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU WANT GONE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
 HERE'S THE SITUATION.
 OKAY.
 I MEAN, I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP
AUBRY.
 OKAY.
 BUT I'M WORRIED THAT SHE'S
GOING TO GET THE VOTES.
 ME TOO.
 AUBRY WILL GET UP THERE, AND
SHE'LL WORK THE JURY.
 LIKE NO OTHER.
 TAI, HE CAN'T SPEAK IN FRONT
OF PEOPLE.
 THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE.
 HE CAN'T TALK.
 UH-HUH.
 I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S
BEST FOR BOTH OF US.
 YEAH.
 MICHELE WANTS TO VOTE OUT
AUBRY.
SHE'S IN THE POSITION TO CALL
THE SHOTS.
AND IT'S TOUGH AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE AUBRY, WE HAVE BEEN LIKE
HOMIES THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME, SO
IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY HARD
TO WRITE AUBRY'S NAME DOWN, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE'S A TOUGH
COMPETITOR, AND AT THE END OF
THE DAY, MY LOYALTY IS TO MY
MOTHER, AND I'M TRYING THE
CHANGE HER LIVE AND CHANGE MY
LIFE, SO IF THAT'S WHAT I NEED
TO DO TO GET TO THE END, THAT'S
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
 ME AND TAI HAVE ACTUALLY
BUILT A RELATIONSHIP.
 UH-HUH.
 I KNOW HE'LL GO WITH US AS
LONG AS IT'S NOT HIS NAME ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M COUNTING ON.
 HE ALMOST I KNOW HE WILL.
 OKAY.
IT'S NERVE-RACKING.
 IT IS.
IT SO IS.
 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE YOU.
 SHOULD I PRACTICE MY
FIRE-MAKING SKILLS?
 NO.
YOU CAN.
YOU.
CAN BUT I'M TELLING YOU.
WE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW.
OKAY?
 OKAY.
 ON THE BOTTOM, RIGHT?
THE GIRLS ALL GET TOGETHER?
 WELL, MY VOTE TONIGHT IS
GOING TO AUBRY.
IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TO YOU.
YOU'RE THE TWO PEOPLE I WOULD
LIKE TO SIT NEXT TO.
 I'M IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE I PUT YOUR NAME DOWN AND
I THOUGHT FOR SURE YOU WOULD PUT
ME DOWN.
 WHEN MICHELE WON, I THOUGHT
IT'S THE WORST THING POSSIBLE
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDOL TO
PROTECT ME.
I FELT COMPLETELY HOPELESS.
THEN MICHELE SAID, YOU KNOW
WHAT, I DECIDED AUBRY TO GO.
 I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
 IF IT'S HER AND NOT ME, I'M
FINE.
 I THINK THAT SHE COULD REALLY
BEAT ALL OF US, AND I THINK
WE'RE ALL KIND OF ON A MORE
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.
AND WE JUST BATTLE IT OUT AND
MAKE OUR CASE.
 UNFORTUNATELY, AUBRY IS AN
EASY VOTE.
I DON'T WANT TO BETRAY HER, BUT
AT SOME POINT ALLIANCES HAVE TO
BREAK.
 SPECIAL FLOWER.
 OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, TAI.
 TAI'S BEING SUPER SHADY, AND
I'M WORRIED THAT AT THE END OF
THE DAY, IF TAI SEES ME AS A
THREAT HE WILL VOTE ME OUT.
SO FAR I'VE BEEN LUCKY.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND IF I'M GOING TO BE ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF THE VOTE, IT'S
GOING TO BE TONIGHT, BUT I'M NOT
GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
GOING TO BE TONIGHT, BUT I'M NOT
GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NEAL, NICK, DEBBIE, SCOT, JULIA,
JAY, -- JASON AND JOE, SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY TO BE PULLED
FROM THE GAME FOR MEDICAL
REASONS.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, MICHELE, LET'S TALK ABOUT
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
YOU'RE DEAD LAST.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING AT THAT
POINT?
 IN THIS GAME, YOU'RE NEVER
REALLY OUT OF IT UNTIL YOU GIVE
UP.
SO THERE WAS A POINT IN THE
PUZZLE WHEN IT JUST CLICKED WITH
ME, AND I WAS JUST MOVING,
MOVING, MOVING, AND I WAS ABLE
TO FINISH IT OUT.
 Jeff: SO TAI, YOU GET BACK
AFTER THE COLLAGE.
WHAT WAS THE VIBE, BECAUSE IT'S
A VERY SMALL CIRCLE.
YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR MICHELE.
YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR YOURSELF.
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.
 I MEAN, WHETHER I VOTE FOR
AUBRY OR I VOTE FOR CYDNEY, NOW
IT'S ALL INDIVIDUAL GAME.
ALLIANCES ARE OUT THE DOOR NOW.
 Jeff: AUBRY, ONE OF THE BIG
THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING EVERY
TIME YOU GUYS VOTE SOMEBODY OUT
IS YOU ARE PUTTING ANOTHER
PERSON ON THE JURY.
AND ULTIMATELY IT IS THE JURY
WHO DECIDES WHO WINS.
SO HOW BIG WILL IT BE TONIGHT?
 I THINK IT'S HUGE TONIGHT.
I THINK THE PERSON THAT GOES TO
THE JURY TONIGHT HAS A LOT OF
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S
HAPPENED IN THIS GAME.
THEY HOLD THE KEY TO PANDORA'S
BOX THAT COULD SHIFT THE ENTIRE
GAME, AND IT'S SOMETHING TO
THINK VERY, VERY CAREFULLY
ABOUT.
 Jeff: MICHELE, SHE LOOKED
RIGHT AT YOU.
 I'M LOOKING AT EVERYONE.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE COIN, NOT ONLY ARE
YOU PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE JURY,
YOU'RE ALSO DECIDING WHO YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO PUT ON THE JURY.
 DEFINITELY.
WHO YOU'RE SITTING HERE WITH IS
MORE CRUCIAL AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PICK PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T AS BIG AS A THREAT AS
OTHER PEOPLE, BASICALLY WHO IS
YOUR BEST CHANCE OF GOING
AGAINST.
 Jeff: AUBRY, DOES EVERYBODY
SEEM TO HAVE A REAL IDEA WHO THE
REAL THREATS ARE, OR DOES
EVERYBODY HAVE A DIFFERENT
OPINION OUT OF WHO COULD WIN OUT
OF THIS FOUR?
 I MEAN, IT'S NOT AN EASY
THING.
SOMETHING THAT WE SEE AS A
THREAT IN SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT BE
SEEN AS A WEAKNESS BY SOMEONE ON
THAT JURY.
I MEAN, SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE
HEARD THAT I'M A THREAT ABOUT I
FIND COMICAL BECAUSE I SEE IT AS
SOMEWHAT OF A WEAKNESS.
 Jeff: SO CYDNEY, THAT'S A
PRETTY CANDID ANSWER FROM AUBRY.
WHAT DOES IT COME DOWN TO FOR
YOU?
 FOR ME IT DEFINITELY COMES
DOWN TO WHAT IS BEST FOR MYSELF
AT THIS POINT.
IT'S A ME GAME, NOT A WE GAME.
 Jeff: TAI, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?
 I THINK THE SAME.
IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL GAME NOW.
HOWEVER TRUTHFUL OR TRUST, $1
MILLION IS A BIG NUMBER.
 Jeff: MICHELE, GIVEN THAT
YOU HAVE THE NECKLACE, DO YOU
FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF POWER?
 I FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF
NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR POWER
WISELY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CYDNEY, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, AUBRY.
CYDNEY.
AUBRY.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
ONE VOTE CYDNEY.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
CYDNEY.
WE HAVE A TIE.
SO IN A REVOTE, THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO WOULD VOTE WOULD BE TAI AND
MICHELE.
DO YOU SEE A REASON TO REVOTE OR
ARE YOU GUYS LOCKED IN?
 YEAH, I'M LOCKED IN.
 I'M LOCKED IN, AS WELL.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IN THAT CASE WHEN WE HAVE A
FINAL FOUR, THE TIEBREAKER IS
THE FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU EACH HAVE A FIRE-MAKING KIT.
THE RULES ARE PRETTY SIMPLE: YOU
HAVE TO BUILD A FIRE FROM THE
BASE OF YOUR FIRE-MAKING
STATION.
THE FIRST PERSON TO BUILD A FIRE
WITH A FLAME HIGH ENOUGH TO BURN
THROUGH THE ROPE LIVES TO SEE
ANOTHER DAY IN THIS GAME.
THE LOSER BECOMES THE EIGHTH
MEMBER OF THE JURY.
BOTH READY?
 YEP.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BEGIN.
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING FIRE FOR 37
DAYS TO BOIL WATER, COOK FOOD.
AUBRY QUICKLY STARTS SHAVING
MAGNESIUM.
CYDNEY DOING THE SAME THING.
EVERYTHING YOU PUT INTO THIS
GAME AND IT COMES DOWN TO THIS:
CAN YOU MAKE FIRE FASTER THAN
THE OTHER PERSON?
CYDNEY GOING FOR BROKE RIGHT
AWAY TRYING TO GET SOMETHING
SPARKING.
THAT WILLIC MIGHT QUICKLY, AS
AUBRY JUST FOUND OUT, BUT IT
ALSO GOES OUT QUICKLY.
GOT TO BE PREPARED TO KEEP YOUR
FIRE GOING ONCE YOU GET IT.
CYDNEY HAS A LITTLE BIT OF FLAME
IF SHE CAN KEEP IT GOING.
IT GOES OUT.
AUBRY HAS FLAME.
SHE HAS A LITTLE STICK IN THERE
NOW TRYING TO GET IT TO CATCH.
THE KEY RIGHT HERE, THAT HESSIAN
WILL BURN, BUT IT BURNS VERY
FAST.
YOU HAVE THE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
IT WHILE IT'S THERE AND BUILD A
LITTLE STRUCTURE NOW.
CYDNEY LIKE SHE HAS FOR 37 DAYS
STICKING WITH HER PLAN.
AUBRY'S FLAME IS GROWING NOW.
CYDNEY GETTING A LOT OF SPARK.
JUST NEEDS TO GET IT TO CATCH
FLAME, AND IT DOES FOR A MOMENT.
AUBRY DOING A NICE JOB BUILDING
THAT FIRE FROM THE BASE OF HER
FIRE-MAKING STATION.
NOW INTO A VERY STRONG FIRE.
CYDNEY NOT GIVING UP.
SHE HAS NOT GIVEN UP EVER IN 37
DAYS OF PLAYING SURVIVOR.
NOT GOING TO START NOW.
CYDNEY TRYING TO NURTURE THE
SMALLEST OF FLAMES, BLOWING ON
IT TRYING TO GET IT TO COME
BACK.
NO FLAME.
AUBRY'S FIRE GAINING NOW IN
INTENSITY.
THAT IS A LEGITIMATE BLAZE.
JUST GOT TO GET IT IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION AND GET IT A LITTLE
HIGHER SO IT STARTS BURNING THE
ROPE.
CYDNEY HAS A LITTLE FLAME.
CAN SHE KEEP IT?
NO.
AUBRY'S FLAME STARTING TO GROW
NOW IN HEIGHT.
STARTING TO BURN ON THE ROPE.
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH MORE.
AUBRY VERY CLOSE.
VERY CLOSE TO LIVING TO SEE DAY
38 IN THIS GAME.
CYDNEY VERY CLOSE TO BECOMING
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF THE JURY.
NOW AUBRY STARTING TO LOSE SOME
OF THAT HEIGHT.
DIDN'T BURN THROUGH THE ROPE.
THE FLAME IS NOW DROPPING.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR CYDNEY.
AUBRY KNOCKS DOWN HER ENTIRE
STRUCTURE.
AUBRY WAS WITHIN SECONDS OF
BURNING THROUGH THE ROPE.
TRIED TO MAKE ONE LITTLE
ADJUSTMENT AND LOST A LOT OF IT.
THERE IS DEFINITELY AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR CYDNEY TO GET IN
THIS.
CYDNEY TRYING TO GET SOMETHING
GOING.
HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING SHE'S
BLOWING ON.
AS AUBRY'S FIRE BURNS CLOSER AND
CLOSER DOWN TO THE BASE OF HER
FIRE-MAKING STATION.
AND NOW AUBRY'S FLAME IS GONE.
SHE HAD AN INFERNO.
NOW SHE'S PICKING THROUGH THE
RUBBLE LOOKING TO REBUILD.
SHE HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING,
TRYING TO NURTURE IT, TRYING TO
BLOW ON IT.
IT'S OUT.
AUBRY'S FIRE STARTING TO BURN
AGAIN.
IT'S COMING BACK MORE QUICKLY
THIS TIME.
THIS TIME SHE'S GOT IT LINED UP
PERFECTLY.
THIS MAY BE AS FAR AS IT GOES
FOR CYDNEY.
THERE IT IS.
AUBRY SURVIVES TRIBAL COUNCIL
AND WILL LIVE TO SEE DAY 38.
CYDNEY BECOMES THE EIGHTH MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.
CYDNEY BECOMES THE EIGHTH MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.
AUBRY, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY
IN THIS GAME.
YOU ARE PART OF THE THREE
REMAINING ALONG WITH TAI AND
MICHELE.
CYDNEY, 37 AMAZING DAYS OUT
HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?
 I WAS JUST OUT HERE TRYING
THE CHANGE MY MOM'S LIFE, TRYING
THE CHANGE MINE.
TO HAVE THAT FOR THE WOMAN I
KNOW NEEDED THIS.
I WANTED TO PAY HER MORTGAGE OFF
AND GET SOME HEALTH INSURANCE,
JUST BASIC HUMAN NECESSITY, GO
TO SCHOOL.
 Jeff: IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING
ADVENTURE TO WATCH YOU COMPETE.
I HOPE IT FULFILLED SOME PART OF
THE ADVENTURE YOU WERE SEEKING.
 IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN
EVERYTHING PLUS SOMETHING.
 Jeff: WELL, CYDNEY, THIS IS
THE END FOR YOU.
YOU BECOME THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF
THE JURY.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 SORRY, CYDNEY.
 IT'S OKAY.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, FOR 37 DAYS THIS GAME HAS
BEEN A ROLLER COASTER, AND THE
ONLY THING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE ON
A ROLLER COASTER IS TO HANG ON
UNTIL THE RIDE IS OVER.
THIS RIDE IS NOT OVER.
TWO DAYS LEFT, GRAB YOUR
TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I CAME HERE THE PLAY A GAME.
I PLAYED ONE OF THE BEST GAMES
OUT THERE.
I GUESS I WASN'T AS SLICK AS I
THOUGHT I WAS.
I MADE ALL THE BIG MOVES, AND
AUBRY WAS PART OF THOSE MOVES,
SO THAT'S THE SAME REASON I WAS
TRYING TO GET HER OUT, AS WELL.
I AM DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD
TO MY JURY SERVICE.
I HOPE EVERYBODY CHOOSES THEIR
WORDS WISELY.
 Jeff: WELL, THAT IS THE
KIND OF DRAMA YOU EXPECT.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU,
TANGELIA, COME UP HERE.
STAND NEXT TO ME.
THIS IS CYDNEY'S MOM.
I WAS WATCHING YOU.
YOU'RE CLEARLY MOVED BECAUSE,
CHECK THIS OUT, CYDNEY DIDN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING, SO YOU DIDN'T
KNOW.
YOU WERE SEEING THAT FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE THE HEAR
HER REASONING?
DID SHE SHARE WHY SHE WAS COMING
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE?
 SHE TOLD ME WHEN I SAW HER ON
THE GROUND, AND IT WAS HARD FOR
ME TO SEE MY BABY LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHEN SHE WAS IN TROUBLE EARLIER
IN THE SEASON.
 I WAS TRYING TO PRETEND I WAS
STRONG AND EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
BUT THAT'S STILL MY BABY.
BUT WE WERE TALKING IN THE
KITCHEN, AND I JUST STARTED
CRYING.
 Jeff: YOU'RE WORRIED AS A
MOM.
 MY BABY.
MY BABY.
 Jeff: SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE
INCREDIBLY PROUD.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT GAME.
 I'M PROUD OF MY BABY.
I'M PROUD OF MY BABY.
 Jeff: CLEARLY BODYBUILDING
COMES FROM MOM AND DAD, AND
MAYBE IF THAT FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE HAD BEEN A BENCH
PRESS, CYDNEY STILL WOULD HAVE
BEEN HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WE LOVE CYDNEY.
I HOPE IT IS NOT THE LAST TIME
SHE'S ON THE SHOW EITHER.
AND IF YOU WANT THE HEAR MORE
ABOUT THE ADVENTURES AFTER
THEY'RE DONE WITH THE SHOW,
PONDEROSA, YOU CAN LITERALLY
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WITH CYDNEY
SECONDS AFTER SHE WALKED OFF
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
BRAINS, BRAWN, BEAUTY LIVE
FINALE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I SERIOUSLY KNEW IF IT WENT TO
FIRE WITH SID, THERE'S NO WAY.
SHE'S NEVER MADE FIRE WITH
FLINT. I KNEW IT WAS ME OR HER.
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL, I ENDED UP
BEATING SYD AT A FIRE MAKING
CHALLENGE.
IT'S THE LAST THING I EVER
THOUGHT I'D BE DOING ON
SURVIVOR.
I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF THAT I
COULD ACTUALLY PULL IT OUT WHEN
I MATTERED IT MOST.
AUBRY SITTING NEXT TO ME INSTEAD
OF CYDNEY DEFIANTLY CHANGES MY
CHANCES IN A REALLY NEGATIVE
WAY.
SHE'S MADE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS
WITH EVERYONE AND FOUGHT HER
WAY HERE.
I'VE BEEN GUNNING FOR AUBREY
AND NOBODY'S WANTED TO JUMP ON
THE BAND WAGON.
EVERYONE RESPECTS AUBREY
NOW THAT SHE JUST FOUGHT
FOR HER LIFE WITH FIRE.
 YEA.
I'M TRYING HARD TO THINK
UP A CASE AGAINST AUBREY
AND SHE'S BEEN IN CONTROL
OF A LOT OF THIS GAME AND
I THINK
TAI JUST GAVE HER A
MILLION DOLLARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GRATEFUL I GET TO SIT WITH
YOU GUYS AT THE
FINAL THREE AND DUKE IT
OUT AND BREAKFAST IN THE
MORNING.
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO
CHALLENGE. JEFF DIDN'T
EVER SAY...
I'M STILL DEBATING WEATHER
THIS IS IT OR ARE WE GOING
TO HAVE ONE MORE CHALLENGE
TOMORROW.
LIKE JEFF SAID, YOU JOBS NOT
DONE. THERE'S 2 DAYS LEFT.
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A FINAL
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHALLENGE.
ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T SAY...?
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHALLENGE.
ANOTHER CHALLENGE? WELL, IT'S
TREE MAIL.
"YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE IS UPON
YOU. THE WINNER EARNS THE
RIGHT TO CROW. AND EVEN MORE
IMPORTANTLY, DECIDES WHO STAYS
AND WHO WILL GO.
WOW.
LOVE YOU TOO MUCH TO GO.
OH MY GOD, HERE I AM ONCE
AGAIN HAVING TO FIGHT FOR
MY LIFE. WE ALL THOUGHT
YESTERDAY WAS THE LAST
CHALLENGE. AND NOW WE
FIND OUT THAT THE PEOPLE
GOING TO THE END, THE
PERSON WHO WINS GETS TO
CHOOSE THE PERSON THEY
ARE TAKING.
SO WHAT YA THINKING?
THIS IS NOW AN INDIVIDUAL
GAME. THERE ARE NO MORE
ALLIANCES. I'M ON MY OWN AND
I DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS.
SO, TODAY'S DO OR DIE FOR ME.
I NEED TO WIN THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
COME ON IN GUYS.
ALRIGHT, ARE YOU GUY READY TO
GET TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?
YES. YES.
FIRST THINGS FIRST. MICHELLE
I'LL TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
TODAY, IMMUNITY IS NOT UP FOR
GRABS.
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FOR IMMUNITY.
YOU ARE THE FINAL THREE.
YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD
YOUR CASE TO THE JURY AND
TRY TO CONVINCE THEM WHY YOU
DESERVE THE MILLION BUCKS.
CONGRATULATIONS!
OH, GOD.
BUT, THERE IS A BUT.
THE BUT IS, YOU WILL BE VOTING
SOMEBODY OUT OF THIS GAME
TONIGHT. IT JUST WON'T BE
EACH OTHER.
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, EARNS THE
RIGHT TO VOTE OUT A JURY
MEMBER.
WHAT?
I MEAN HOLLY CRAP.
THAT'S CRAZY.
 Jeff: THAT MEANS IF THERE
IS SOMEBODY ON THAT JURY THAT
YOU'RE CONCERNED WILL NOT VOTE
FOR YOU, WIN THIS CHALLENGE,
REMOVE THEM FROM THE GAME.
NET RESULT ONE LESS VOTE FOR
YOUR COMPETITION.
COULD BE A $1 MILLION MOVE.
 WOW.
 Jeff: BIG STAKES, RIGHT?
 HUGE.
 HUGE.
 WOW.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR.
NOW LET ME TELL YOU HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO EARN IT.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON A WOBBLY
BEAM WHILE USING A LONG POLE TO
STACK BALLS ON STANDS.
IF YOUR TACK FALLS, YOU HAVE TO
START OVER.
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH EARNS THE
RIGHT TO VOTE OUT A JURY MEMBER.
YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THIS.
THIS WAS FROM YOUR VERY FIRST
CHALLENGE.
NOBODY CHOSE IT.
TODAY IT'S NOT AN OPTION.
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TEST YOUR
SKILLS.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
 YES.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR A BIG REWARD, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO!
ONE AT A TIME YOU MUST STACK A
BALL, THEN A STAND, THEN ANOTHER
BALL, THEN ANOTHER STAND.
WE GIVE YOU THAT FIRST STAND SO
YOU CAN GET THAT FIRST BALL IN
THERE KIND OF LEVEL.
THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE A
LEARNING CURVE TO THIS.
DON'T PANIC IF YOU START
DROPPING EARLY.
TAI AND MICHELE BOTH HAVE THEIR
FIRST BALLS UP.
AUBRY STILL WORKING ON HERS.
UNLIKE A PUZZLE, WHICH STARTS
DIFFICULT AND GETS EASIER, THIS
CHALLENGE STARTS EASY AND GETS
MORE DIFFICULT.
MICHELE OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD
WITH HER SECOND BALL.
AUBRY WITH HER SECOND STAND.
TAI NOW HAS HIS SECOND BALL.
AUBRY PLACES HER SECOND BALL.
WE HAVE EVERYBODY WITH TWO
BALLS.
MICHELE NOW PLACES HER THIRD
STAND.
TAI PLACES HIS THIRD STAND.
IT IS MICHELE AND TAI AND THEN
AUBRY.
MICHELE NOW HAS HER THIRD BALL.
AUBRY NOW WITH HER THIRD STAND.
VERY CLOSE RIGHT NOW.
HERE COMES TAI WITH HIS THIRD
BALL.
AUBRY NOW WITH HER THIRD BALL.
MICHELE NOW WITH HER FOURTH
BALL.
AND THERE ARE SIX TOTAL.
MICHELE DROPS.
NOW TAI IN THE LEAD.
AUBRY RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP.
WHEN YOU JUMP OFF YOUR PLATFORM,
JUST BE AWARE, YOU'RE VIBRATING
THE VERY THING THAT YOU'RE STACK
IS STANDING ON.
AUBRY DROPS.
TAI IS NOT LOOKING GOOD.
NOT GOING TO STAY.
JUST A MATTER OF MOMENTS.
THERE IT GOES.
EVERYBODY STARTING OVER.
IT'S NOW MICHELE BACK IN THE
LEAD.
MICHELE REBUILDING MAO WITH HER
THIRD BALL.
AUBRY NOW STARTING OVER.
SHE HAS HER SECOND BALL.
TAI HAD TO START COMPLETELY
OVER.
NO MOMENTUM YET.
MICHELE MOVING QUICKLY WITH HER
FOURTH STAND.
THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT DOES
REQUIRE PRECISION.
MOVING FAST IS OF NO USE IF
YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT ON YOUR
STACK.
BECAUSE THE HIGHER IT GOES, THE
MORE THAT BALANCE BECOMES
IMPORTANT.
MICHELE PLACES HER FOURTH BALL.
THERE'S AUBRY WITH HER FOURTH
STACK.
EVERY SINGLE PIECE YOU PLACE
MATTERS THE POSITION YOU PUT IT
MANY BECAUSE THE HIGHER YOU GO,
THE MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES TO
KEEP IT STRAIGHT.
MICHELE COMING BACK WITH HER
FIFTH STAND.
IT IS MICHELE IN THE LEAD.
THEN AUBRY, THEN TAI.
HERE COMES AUBRY WITH HER FOURTH
BALL.
GOT IT.
MICHELE COMING BACK WITH HER
FIFTH BALL.
TAI COMING BACK WITH HIS THIRD
STAND.
AUBRY PLACES HER FIFTH STAND.
MICHELE PLACES HER FIFTH BALL.
ONE LEFT.
AUBRY NOW WITH HER FIFTH BALL.
MICHELE NOW WITH HER SIXTH
STAND.
MICHELE LOOKING VERY GOOD.
AUBRY LOOKING VERY GOOD.
TAI IN TROUBLE.
MICHELE PLACES HER LAST STAND.
HEADING BACK FOR THAT LAST BALL.
AUBRY PLACES HER LAST STAND,
HEADING BACK FOR THAT LAST BALL.
STACKS BOTH LOOK GOOD.
WHO WILL GET THERE FIRST?
HERE COMES MICHELE.
HERE COMES AUBRY.
MICHELE NOW HAS TO PLACE THAT
SIXTH AND FINAL BALL.
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS TRICKY.
AUBRY IS WITH HER SIXTH BALL.
YOU HAVE TO GET THAT BALL PLACED
AND THEN GET THE FULL OUT AND
IT'S GOT TO STAY STACKED AUBRY
LOSES EVERYTHING!
MICHELE WINS INDIVIDUAL REWARD
TO VOTE OUT A JURY MEMBER.
 GOOD JOB, BABY.
 THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
 AMAZING.
 Jeff: MICHELE, COME ON
OVER.
ALL RIGHT, MICHELE.
THIS IS YOURS.
THERE'S A PIECE OF PARCHMENT IN
THERE THAT YOU'LL USE TO VOLT
WITH.
YOU GET THE HONOR TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL OF READING THAT
NOTE AND LETTING THE JURY KNOW
OF THE TWIST THAT WILL IMPACT
THEM.
 AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
NICE JOB.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU WON'T BE
VOTING ANYBODY OUT FROM YOUR
TRIBE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK.
 MICHELE GETS TO VOTE OFF A
MEMBER OF THE JURY.
AND DAMN DO I WISH I HAD THAT
DECISION TO MAKE.
IT'S A GAME CHANGER.
AND HOW SHE DECIDES TO PLAY IT
COULD MESS UP MY WHOLE GAME.
 WELL, WE ALL MADEED TO IT DAY
39!
 OH, WHAT A GIFT.
OH, MY GOD.
I WAS SO TERRIFIED.
 TERRIFIED.
WE CAN ALL STAY FRIENDS NOW.
 YEAH, THANK GOD.
WE WOULD HAVE STAYED FRIENDS
ANYWAY.
WHEN JEFF SAID, "YOU'RE THE
FINAL THREE.
" I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE
ECSTATIC.
THEN JEFF TURNS AROUND AND SAYS,
WHOEVER WINS THIS CHALLENGE HAS
A CHANCE TO VOTE OUT A JURY
MEMBER.
THAT'S HUGE.
 I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
GOOD FOR YOU.
 THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN
THIS GAME.
SO IT'S NEW TERRITORY.
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I
HAVE THOUGHT OF EVERY POSSIBLE
OUTCOME BECAUSE IT COULD BE A $1
MILLION DECISION THAT I'M MAKING
TONIGHT.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK I GOT TO GO JOE.
 JOE'S FOR SURE.
 HE'S FOR SURE NOT GOING TO
VOTE FOR ME.
 HE'S DEAD SET ON AUBRY.
 I FEEL LIKE IT'S SMART TO
JUST GO WITH THE ONE YOU KNOW IS
POSITIVE.
 IT'S OBVIOUS.
THE BRAIN SIDE, IT'S NOT SMART
TO TAKE NEAL OUT.
NEAL CAN PERSUADE PEOPLE ON HER
BEHALF.
I NEED THE INFLUENCE MICHELE.
THERE'S ONLY EIGHT JURY MEMBERS.
SO REMOVE ONE TIPS THE BALANCE,
AND IF YOU REMOVE THE RIGHT
PERSON, TIP THE BALANCE ON YOUR
FAVOR.
 JOE I'M DEFINITELY SURE ON.
NEAL COULD GO ANOTHER WAY, BUT
MOST LIKELY HE'LL GO WITH HER.
 YEAH.
 I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE,
RIGHT?
 THOSE WOULD BE THE TWO.
 AUBRY, I BROUGHT UP NEAL
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK NEAL WOULD
VOTE FOR ME, SO MAKE HER FEEL
LIKE IT'S HER IDEA, AND
HOPEFULLY MICHELE VOTES THE
RIGHT PERSON.
 I DEFINITELY WANT TO PICK
YOUR BRAIN AND SEE WHAT SOME
OPTIONS ARE BECAUSE THE OBVIOUS
CHOICE WOULD BE JOE.
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON THAT I CAN
THINK OF THAT IS 100% IN ONE
DIRECTION.
 YES.
 OTHER THAN POSSIBLY NEAL.
 I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO VOTE THAT WAY.
 I HAVE TWO PEOPLE ON THE JURY
THAT I THINK WOULD VOTE FOR ME.
AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE JOE AND
NEAL.
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE PUBLIC
ENEMIES NUMBER ONE AND TWO.
 IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR
MIND WHO YOU CAN SEE MAYBE THEY
WOULD BE EVEN MORE OF A THREAT?
 I'M OPERATING RIGHT NOW THAT
TAI HAS MORE VOTES THAN HE'S
LETTING ON.
 AGREED.
 WHO IS GOING TO BE A SUCKER
FOR HIS EPIC DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH STORY?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK JASON AND SCOT, THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE THEY COULD GO TAI.
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THEY COULD
BE BITTER AGAINST TAI.
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE JASON VOTING
MY DIRECTION, AS WELL AS SCOT.
 YEAH.
 THE OTHER HAND OF JOE IS THAT
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET UP THERE
AND MAUL ANYBODY.
 RIGHT.
 I KNOW.
I CAN SEE SCOT DOING THAT.
 AT THIS POINT, I GOT TO SAVE
MYSELF.
SO I TOLD HER THAT, HECK, MAYBE
SCOT'S THE PERSON TO TAKE OUT
BECAUSE HE COULD COME OUT AND
SLANDER HER CHARACTER, BASICALLY
JUST TELL HER THAT TAI IS A
REALLY BIG THREAT.
 WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE'S BEEN
THROUGH, YOU KNOW, IF HE CAN GET
UP THERE AND ARTICULATE WHAT
HE'S DONE, HE'S A HUGE THREAT.
 I PLANTED THE SEED.
HOPEFULLY IT WORKS BECAUSE HOW
MICHELE DECIDES TO PLAY IT COULD
WEAKEN ME.
SHE HAS A LOADED GUN.
I JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T HAVE
VERY GOOD AIM.
 HEY.
 DID YOU TALK TO MICHELE?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I VOTE SCOT.
 WHY SCOT?
 THEY'RE VERY PERSUASIVE, HIM
AND JASON.
I COULD TOTALLY VOTE OUT SCOT.
 AUBRY'S VERY CLEVER.
SCOT POTENTIALLY WOULD BE MY
VOTE.
I BETRAYED HIM DEEPLY, BUT HE
MIGHT UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE
MY BIG MOVE AND HE COULD
PERSUADE SOME PEOPLE.
 IF HE HAS SOMEONE IN MIND,
THEN HE COULD STAND UP THERE AND
FIGHT YOUR CASE FOR THEM.
 THAT'S REALLY WEAK.
I DON'T FOLLOW.
JOE IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS I
THINK.
 I HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTION,
AND I'M WEIGHING THEM OUT RIGHT
NOW TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH WAY
WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME.
AND IT'S SCARY, BECAUSE IF I
TAKE OUT THE WRONG PERSON, THEN
I'M GOING TO LOOK REALLY STUPID.
AND THIS DECISION THAT I MAKE,
THAT WILL BE THE LAST THING THAT
THE JURY WILL REMEMBER BEFORE
THE FINAL VOTE.
THE JURY WILL REMEMBER BEFORE
THE FINAL VOTE.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NEAL, NICK, DEBBIE, SCOT, JULIA,
JASON, JOE, AND CYDNEY VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT
TO THE FINAL THREE.
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO
IN THE GAME, AND TOMORROW NIGHT
YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD
YOUR CASE TO THE JURY WHERE YOUR
GOAL IS TO GET EVERY ONE OF THEM
TO VOTE FOR YOU TO WIN THE GAME.
BUT THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.
LET'S FOCUS ON THE PRESENT.
TODAY, MICHELE, YOU WON THE
REWARD.
YOUR FOURTH INDIVIDUAL WIN.
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
IT CAME WITH IT A VERY VALUABLE
ADVANTAGE.
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT THE ADVANTAGE
IS.
THE JURY DOESN'T, SO GO AHEAD
AND READ IT SO WE CAN CATCH
EVERYBODY UP.
 TONIGHT YOU WILL VOTE OUT ONE
MEMBER OF THE JURY.
 WOW.
 THIS PERSON WILL NOT BE
PRESENT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL AND WILL NOT HAVE A VOTE
IN WHO WINS THIS GAME.
CHOOSE WISELY.
THIS MAY BE A $1 MILLION
DECISION.
 Jeff: SO THE STAKES ARE
VERY CLEAR.
YOUR ADVANTAGE IS TO REMOVE ONE
PERSON FROM THAT JURY THAT
YOU'RE PRETTY SURE IS EITHER
VOTING FOR TAI OR AUBRY.
AND THAT GETS YOU ONE VOTE
CLOSER TO THE END.
SO TELL ME ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON.
YOU'RE CLEARLY THINKING IN YOUR
HEAD, RUNNING NUMBERS, WHO IS ON
MY SIDE, WHO ISN'T.
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, ONE VOTE UP THERE
COULD BE THE DECIDING FACTOR
BETWEEN WHO WINS $1 MILLION AND
WHO LOSE, AND SO I'VE BEEN
RUNNING NUMBERS ALL DAY.
I'VE BEEN BOUNCING IDEAS OFF
THEM, AS WELL.
 Jeff: WHAT ABOUT TAI OR
AUBRY'S OPINION COULD YOU TRUST?
 IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU
COULD SEE THEM PROTECTING
RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY HAVE,
TRYING TO STEER YOU CERTAIN
WAYS, AND I'M JUST TRYING THE
FIGURE OUT WHO I CAN APPEAL TO
IN THE END AND WHO IS ALREADY
KIND OF SET ON THEIR DECISION.
 Jeff: SO, AUBRY, YOU CAN
ONLY BE THINKING ONE THING, I
DON'T CARE WHO YOU PULL OFF THIS
JURY, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ONE OF
MY VOTES.
 JEFF, THIS IS UNCHARTED
TERRITORY.
THE MAP HASN'T BEEN DRAWN FOR
THIS PART OF "SURVIVOR" YET, SO
I TALKED TO MICHELE ABOUT IT.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN
PLAY THIS VOTE.
YOU CAN PLAY WITH WHAT YOU THINK
IS A SURE THING AND TAKE
SOMEBODY OUT IF YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE VOTING WITH YOU.
OR YOU CAN OPT TO MAKE A MOVE.
IT CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT
WAYS.
 Jeff: TAI, I'M A LITTLE
CONFUSED.
TO ME IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
I HAVE A PIECE OF PARCHMENT, AND
HOPEFULLY I WRITE DOWN THE NAME
OF SOMEBODY THAT WAS NEVER GOING
TO VOTE FOR ME, AND THAT TAKES
THE VOTE FROM YOU OR AUBRY.
TELL ME WHERE I'M MISSING THE
LAYER?
 I THINK THE CHANCE TO VOTE
FOR SOMEBODY FOR SURE OR YOU
VOTE SOMEBODY OUT WHO CAN MAKE A
BIG STATEMENT AND INFLUENCE
OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THE JURY, AS
WELL.
AND ALSO THROW OUT A QUESTION TO
YOU AND THROW AN EASY QUESTION
TO THE PERSON THEY'RE
SUPPORTING.
 Jeff: SO MICHELE, IT'S NOT
JUST REMOVING A JURY MEMBER,
IT'S MAKING SURE I REMOVE THE
ONE THAT HAS THE MOST POTENTIAL
TO PERSUADE THE ENTIRE JURY TO
VOTE FOR TAI OR AUBRY?
 EXACTLY.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE OVER
THERE THAT COULD DEFINITELY GO
WITH TAI, MULTIPLE PEOPLE COULD
DEFINITELY GO WITH AUBRY.
BASICALLY WHO IS GOING TO STAND
UP THERE AND RAISE HELL FOR THAT
PERSON THAT THEY WANT TO WIN THE
MILLION AND DIMINISH MY NAME
THAT MUCH MORE.
 Jeff: SO, MICHELE, IN A
WAY, FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL HAS
ALREADY STARTED AND NOW YOU HAVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A GIANT
IMPRESSION.
DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE SOMEBODY
WHO NOT ONLY WASN'T GOING TO
VOTE FOR YOU, BUT THAT PERSON
ALSO WOULD HAVE HURT YOUR GAME
IN OTHER WAYS?
 I'VE GATHERED AS MUCH
INFORMATION AS I POSSIBLY COULD
ABOUT EVERYBODY AND THE PERSON
THAT I'M CHOOSING TONIGHT HAS
THE CAPABILITY TO BE VERY
PERSUASIVE AND THEIR VOTE WAS
NOT GOING TO GO FOR ME, AND SO,
YES, I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN MY
DECISION.
IT'S GOING TO STRENGTHEN MY GAME
AND MAKE ME FEEL STRONGER AND
MORE CONFIDENT GOING INTO NEXT
TRIBAL.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
MICHELE, IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
I'LL GO GET THE VOTE.
THE JURY MEMBER WHO AFTER 38
DAYS WILL NOT BE A PART OF THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL AND WILL
HAVE NO SAY IN WHO WINS THIS
GAME... NEAL.
NEAL, YOU'VE BEEN VOTED OUT OF
THE JURY.
YOU'LL BE SEQUESTERED UNTIL
AFTER THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE MY NAME
WRITTEN DOWN.
 YOU CAME TO THIS GAME LIKE A
BAD-ASS BITCH, BUT YOU'RE MORE
LIKE A PUPPY SUCKLING AT THE
TEET, AND I DON'T THINK YOU
STAND A CHANCE.
 Jeff: I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF,
THAT BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
MIGHT HAVE MADE THE RIGHT
CHOICE.
 I THINK SO.
 Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE GONE AS
FAR AS YOU CAN GO IN THE GAME,
AUBRY, TAI, MICHELE.
YOU'VE OUTLASTED EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THIS GAME.
BUT NOW THE POWER DOES SHIFT.
NOW SEVEN PEOPLE WILL NOW DECIDE
YOUR FATE.
YOU HAVE ONE NIGHT LEFT HERE.
GET SOME SLEEP.
CLEARLY YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I THINK TONIGHT WAS A GREAT
SWAN SONG TO BE FIRST-EVER JURY
MEMBER TO GET VOTED OUT.
I THINK MICHELE VOTING ME OUT OF
THE JURY WAS PROBABLY HER ONLY
MOVE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
ABSOLUTELY BEEN A BIG ADVOCATE
OF AUBRY.
IT WAS SMART OF MICHELE, BUT I
DON'T THINK IT'S GOING THE
MATTER BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO
OTHER COMPETITORS THAT PLAYED
BETTER GAMES THAN SHE DID.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: I REALLY WISH THAT
EVERYBODY WATCHING AT HOME COULD
WATCH WITH US HERE, BECAUSE THE
SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS REALLY
EXCITING, AND THAT'S WHY YOU
WATCH THOSE TWISTS, THOSE NEW
TWISTS.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, HOLD ON
HERE, I JUST WANT THE SHARE
THIS.
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, THAT
VOTE OUT A JURY MEMBER, I'M NOT
SURE IF THIS IS A GOOD THING OR
NOT, WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THAT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND JUST
WAITED UNTIL WE THOUGHT THE TIME
WAS RIGHT.
CLEARLY IT LOOKS LIKE WE WERE
RIGHT BECAUSE THAT WAS A
DRAMATIC MOVE.
ALL RIGHT.
SO NEAL GETS VOTED OUT, PULLED
OUT, DOESN'T EVEN GET VOTED OUT.
NOW HE GETS VOTED OUT OF THE
JURY.
ROUGH SEASON FOR HIM.
HE WON'T BE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
BUT THERE IS AN UNEXPECTED GUEST
WHO WILL BE AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
IS IT A TWIST?
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL BE BACK.
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, I WILL HAVE
THE VOTES.
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, I WILL HAVE
THE VOTES.
 HE WASN'T TOO KIND ON THE WAY
OUT, WAS HE?
 HE MAULED ME ON THE WAY OUT.
 MY GOODNESS.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NEXT.
 WELL, I GOT SLAUGHTERED.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TRIBAL.
 YEAH.
 I'M SCARED.
 NEAL WENT OUT KICKING AND
SCREAMING, AND, YOU KNOW, IT
PROVED MY POINT HE WAS PROBABLY
GOING THE BASH ME AT TRIBAL, AND
I DIDN'T GIVE HIM THAT
OPPORTUNITY.
SO IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE ON MY
END.
BUT IF TONIGHT WAS ANY TASTE OF
WHAT TOMORROW'S GOING TO BE
LIKE, I THINK WE'RE ALL IN FOR A
WORLD OF HURT.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE A ROAST.
MY WORST NIGHTMARE HAPPENED
TONIGHT.
MICHELE USED HER REWARD
ADVANTAGE TO VOTE OUT NEAL.
I THINK NEAL WAS GOING TO VOTE
FOR ME.
BUT I'M STILL IN THIS GAME UNTIL
THE VERY END.
SO I NEED TO FIGHT REALLY HARD
FOR HOWEVER MANY OTHER VOTES I
CAN GET.
CAN GET.
 I HAVE MAIL.
 ALL RIGHT.
 CONGRATULATIONS, FINAL THREE.
AT YOUR CONVENIENCE, FOLLOW THE
TRAIL BEHIND YOUR CAMP TO ONE
ADDITIONAL SURPRISE, AND SEE
WHAT TOLL THESE 39 DAYS HAVE
TAKEN.
LET'S GO!
BEING HERE AND KNOWING THAT I'M
FINAL THREE, I'M LIKE, OKAY,
THERE IS A FREAKING SHOT.
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A MIRROR.
OH, AND A SCALE.
 A SCALE?
 OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS CRAZY.
WOW.
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO CONVINCE
THE JURY THAT I DIDN'T GET HERE
BY LUCK OR BY CHANCE AND THAT,
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SLIDE
THROUGH.
I MADE LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS HERE
AND THERE AND FOUGHT MY WAY TO
MY SPOT HERE.
AND WHEN I NEEDED TO WIN
CHALLENGES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I DID.
 MY GOD.
WHOA.
I LOOK LIKE... OH, MY GOD.
 WHERE'S MY BUTT.
OH, MY GOD.
 IT'S NOT THERE.
NO JUNK IN THE TRUNK.
I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, GIRL.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I NEED
THAT $1 MILLION, SO I'M PUTTING
IT ALL ON THE LINE, AND I HOPE
THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT I'M NOT
SOME TIMID GIRL WHO GLIDED ALONG
BUT SOMEONE WHO STRATEGICALLY
MADE MOVES THIS WHOLE GAME.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S BREAD AND BUTTER.
 EGGS.
 EGGS.
 BACON.
 VEGETABLES.
 I'M THIS CLOSE TO FINISHING
THE GAME.
BUT ONE LAST THING IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO FACE THE JURY
AND ANSWER THAT QUESTION TO
THEIR SATISFACTION, AND IF I
DON'T DO IT RIGHT TONIGHT, THE
JURY WON'T GIVE ME THEIR VOTE,
AND THEN ALL THIS HARDSHIP I'VE
DONE FOR THE LAST 39 DAYS WILL
GO TO WASTE.
 TO THE FINAL THREE.
 FINAL THREE.
 THANK YOU, GUYS.
 THE BIGGEST THING THAT I DID
IS PULL OFF THE BLIND SIDE SCOT,
BECAUSE AFTER SCOT FELL,
EVERYBODY FELL WITH HIM.
SO THAT CHANGED THE WHOLE GAME.
 OH, MY GOD.
 BUT I BETRAYED SCOT, AND IF I
WANT TO WIN $1 MILLION, I HAVE
TO WIN SCOT OVER, BUT HE'S A BIG
FAN OF THE GAME, AND HE KNOWS
HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED.
I HOPE HE'S ABLE TO SEE THAT AND
SAY, YEAH, HE'S A GREAT PLAYER.
AND HE COULD GET MY VOTE.
 I'VE GONE THROUGH SUCH A
TRANSFORMATION FROM DAY ONE TO
DAY 39.
THE PERSON I WAS ON DAY ONE WAS
SOMEBODY COMPLETELY PARALYZED BY
THE PROSPECT OF MAKING A
DECISION, AND THIS GAME SHOOK ME
OUT OF MY ANXIOUS BALL OF
CRAZINESS AND TAUGHT ME THAT
IT'S OKAY TO BE IN CONTROL AND
IT'S OKAY IF PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU
TO BE A THREAT.
I'M REALLY PSYCHED TO BE IN THE
FINAL THREE, GET TO PLEAD MY
CASE TO THE JURY, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO GET TOO EXCITED, BECAUSE
MY GAME HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE
MAP.
IT'S BEEN LIKE A POTPOURRI OF
"SURVIVOR" TRIUMPHS AND MISHAPS,
AND WHILE I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
THE FLASHIEST PERSON, I WAS THE
WOMAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN, MAKING
THINGS HAPPEN.
BUT I'M GOING INTO THIS FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL LIKE I GO INTO
ANY TRIBAL COUNCIL.
MY HEAD IS ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
HOW DO I GET IT OFF?
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NICK, DEBBIE, SCOT, JULIA,
JASON, JOE, AND CYDNEY.
SO ON DAY ONE WHEN YOU'RE
FRESH-FACED, WELL FED, YOUR
CLOTHES ARE CLEAN, THIS IS WHAT
YOU DREAM ABOUT, GETTING TO THE
END.
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT.
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO
IN THE GAME.
THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT IS
CONVINCING THESE SEVEN JURY
MEMBERS THAT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
DESERVES THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION THAT
GOES WITH IT.
THEY ARE GOING THE MAKE YOU EARN
IT.
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET
THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO
MAKE A $1 MILLION DECISION.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS A
MOMENT TO COMPOSE YOURSELF, AND
THEN WE'LL GET TO IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO BRING THIS 39-DAY
ADVENTURE TO A CLOSE.
NICK, GET US GOING.
 CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT
THIS FAR.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME
ADVICE AND WHERE WE ARE AT AS A
JURY.
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME
ANIMOSITY TONIGHT.
SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN GET A
QUESTION.
SOME OF YOU MIGHT GET A
STATEMENT.
SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY
QUESTION THAT IS ASKED TOWARD
YOU.
MICHELE, DISPLAY INTELLIGENCE
TONIGHT.
IN YOUR ANSWERS, IN YOU GAME
PLAY, AND SHOW THIS JURY THAT
YOU DO HAVE INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT
COMES TO YOUR STRATEGY.
TAI, DECEMBER PLAY AWARENESS
WITH YOUR GAME PLAY.
AND AUBRY, YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY
CONFIDENCE.
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU DON'T
HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING THIS
GAME.
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, BE
HONEST.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU SCREWED UP.
WHEN THEY ASK THEIR QUESTIONS,
I'LL BE LISTENING, WIDE OPEN.
 Jeff: DEBBIE.
 WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
THREE OF YOU.
YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY BE PROUD
OF YOURSELVES.
I AM.
IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE.
TAI, YOU CAME UP WITH SOME
INEXPLICABLE VOTES SWITCHING
FROM THE GUYS TO THE GIRLS TO
THE GUYS TO THE GIRLS.
I'M JUST REALLY CURIOUS, IS
THERE MORE THAN ONE PERSONALITY
IN YOUR SKULL WHERE YOU WERE
JUST TORN WITH INDECISIVENESS IN
YOUR STRATEGY?
 I COME TO THE GAME THINKING
SOCIAL GAME IS THE TOUGHEST PART
BECAUSE I DO THE PHYSICAL PART.
I ENJOY, THAT BUT I DON'T THINK
I DID WHAT YOU SAY I DID,
FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH STARTING
WITH SWITCH.
I WAS WITH SCOT AND AUBRY AT THE
SAME TIME.
AND I WAS LOYAL TO THAT UNTIL
WHEN WE MERGED.
AND SUDDENLY SCOT AND JASON
SEEMED TO RUN THE SHOW IN MY
LITTLE ALLIANCE.
AT THAT JUNCTION SCOT AND JASON
WERE TRYING TO VOTE OUT AUBRY,
AND AT THAT POINT I BROKE THE
ALLIANCE.
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?
 IT'S PISSY, BUT I'M FOLLOWING
YOU.
I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO YOU DO
NOT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY DISORDER.
 I DON'T.
I FEEL LIKE FOR ME IT'S A
CONSISTENT GAME.
I ONLY FLIPPED ONCE.
I WAS NOT BACK AND FORTH, BACK
AND FORTH.
I ONLY SWITCHED ONE, WHICH IS
SCOT.
BUT THAT'S A BIG MOVE I GOT TO
MAKE.
 ALL RIGHT.
AUBRY, IT WAS A THRILL FOR ME TO
WATCH YOUR METAMORPHOSIS FROM A
NEUROTIC NERD TO A GEEK WARRIOR.
I WAS THERE DAY ONE, DAY TWO.
WE'RE COLD, WE'RE WET, WE'RE
MISERABLE.
WE'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.
AND MY PERCEPTION WAS I HELPED
KEEP YOU IN THE GAME, AND DO YOU
REALLY THINK YOU'D HAVE DONE THE
SAME THING FOR ME?
 I ABSOLUTELY DO, DEBBIE.
YOU ARE MY ONE REGRET IN THE
GAME.
WHEN YOU WERE ABOUT TO HAVE HEAT
STROKE, THAT WAS THE SCARIEST
MOMENT FOR ME IN THIS GAME.
IT TRULY WAS.
AND BY BEING SO CLOSE TO YOU,
THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE THE HARD
DECISION I HAD TO MAKE IN MY
GAME THAT MUCH MORE PAINFUL,
THAT MUCH MORE OF A BETRAYAL, SO
AS A HUMAN BEING, I ABSOLUTELY
WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YOU,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
GAME-WISE, WE WERE HEADED IN TWO
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, AND YOU
WERE TOO MUCH OF A THREAT.
 I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
 THANK YOU, DEBBIE.
 WE LET OUR GEEK FLAGS FLY,
GIRLFRIEND.
 WE DID.
 WELL DONE.
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN, ALL OF
YOU.
 THANK YOU, DEBBIE.
 Jeff: JULIA, YOU'RE UP.
 SO, MICHELE, I THINK IT'S
SAFE TO SAY AT THIS POINT THAT
YOU ARE PROBABLY THE WEAKEST
LINK ON THE BEAUTY TRIBE
INITIALLY, AND I THINK THAT
FIRST HALF OF THE GAME, YOU GOT
REALLY LUCKY, NOT GOING TO A
TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR 22 DAYS, YOU
JUST GOT TO SLIDE THROUGH
WITHOUT STRATEGIZING.
THEN THE MERGE HAPPENED AND YOU
BECAME A NUMBER.
YOU WERE DRAGGED.
IN THE NEXT BLIND SIDE YOU WERE
A NUMBER.
IN THE DEBBIE BLIND SIDE YOU
WERE A NUMBER, AND IN THE SCOT
BLIND SIDE YOU WERE BLIND SIDED
BY YOUR OWN ALLIANCE.
SO WHEN YOU VOTED ME OUT, YOUR
TIGHTEST ALLIANCE, I WAS PROUD
OF YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS
YOUR BIGGEST MOVE, AND FOR ME
THAT WAS YOUR TURNING POINT IN
THE GAME, BUT IS THAT ENOUGH TO
JUSTIFY A $1 MILLION VOTE, JUST
THAT VERY TAIL END OF YOUR GAME?
 I THINK IT TOOK TIME FOR ME
TO FIND MY FOOTING IN THIS GAME.
I THINK THAT COMING IN ON BRAIN
OR COMING IN ON BRAWN, YOU HAD
INTELLIGENCE OR YOU HAD
STRENGTH, AND WHEN YOU COME IN
ON BEAUTY, YOU HAVE TO PROVE
THAT YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS.
YOU KNOW, YOU COME IN WITH THIS
AUTOMATIC STEREOTYPE.
SO FOR ME, MAYBE IT LOOKED LIKE,
YEAH, I WAS DRAGGED OR WHATEVER,
BUT WHEN I FIGURED IT OUT, I
THINK I WAS ABLE TO EXCEL IN IT.
THOSE DECISIONS WERE WELL
THOUGHT OUT FOR MYSELF AND FOR
YOU UNTIL, UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD
TO VOTE YOU OUT.
 OKAY.
 TAI, I THINK YOU HAD THE
OPPOSITE.
YOU STARTED OUT SO STRONG.
I WANTED YOU OUT FROM THE GET-GO
BECAUSE YOU WERE A HUGE ASSET AT
CAMP.
YOU WERE DOMINANT ON CHALLENGES.
YOU WERE A HUGE THREAT.
YOU WERE CONSISTENT UNTIL THE
MERGE.
THEN THINGS STARTED TO GO CRAZY.
DO YOU THINK MY VOTE SHOULD BE
JUSTIFIED FOR A STRONG FIRST
HALF OF THE GAME AND A DEE TIER
RATING FINISH?
 BASICALLY I STARTED REALLY
SONG.
I BLIND SIDED SCOT.
AFTER THIS I WAS NOT WEAK.
I JUST FOUND AN ALIGNS I WAS
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WENT ALL
THE WAY TO THE END.
 DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHAT
DESERVES $1 MILLION?
 DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU VALUE
MORE?
FOR ME I STILL THINK MY
ACCOMPLISHMENTS EARLY ON, ALL
THE THINGS I DID, I THINK THAT
TRUMP WHAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED.
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR
ME.
 THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOUR
RESPONSES.
 Jeff: THANKS, JULIA.
JOE, YOU'RE UP.
 MICHELE, I KIND OF KNOW WHAT
YOUR GAME IS ABOUT, SO TONIGHT
I'M GOING TO DIRECT MYSELF TO
THESE TWO OTHER FOLKS OVER HERE.
TAI, LET ME START WITH YOU.
YOU ARE A SELFLESS, HARD-WORKING
MAN, YOU HAVE WHAT I WOULD CALL
A BUDDHIST SOULFULNESS ABOUT
YOURSELF.
YOU'RE A VERY, VERY TRUTHFUL
MAN, WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS WHAT
MADE YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE THE
ONE CONSIDERED AND NOT AUBRY?
 COMPARED TO AUBRY, I
ACCOMPLISHED MORE AND ALSO
PHYSICALLY.
I FOUND THE IDOL AND I WON AN
EXTRA VOTE AND WON IMMUNITY.
I MADE THE BIG MOVE TO GET SCOT
OUT.
ALL THOSE THINGS I ACCOMPLISHED,
I MEAN, I THINK AUBRY AND I HAVE
THE SAME KIND OF COMPUTER, KEEP
RUNNING, RUNNING, RUNNING,
RUNNING.
 BUT YOUR COMPUTE SIR A LITTLE
MORE HAYWIRE, BUT GOOD ANSWER.
AUBRY, HOW DID YOUR GAME DIFFER
AND WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT
YOU REALLY SHOULD RECEIVE OUR
VOTES?
 IN TERMS OF STRATEGY, TAI WAS
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IN THAT HE
CAME TO ME WITH A LOT OF
INFORMATION, BUT I KIND OF HAD
TO STEP TO THE PLATE WITH THE
TOOLS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THESE
IDEAS.
IF TAI DIDN'T HAVE ME, NOTHING
WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.
AFTER THE MERGE, I WAS ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF EVERY SINGLE VOTE.
TAI WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
VOTE THREE TIMES.
TAI HAD SUPER IDOLS AND
ADVANTAGES, BUT I DON'T THINK HE
HAD HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF
THIS GAME.
LIKE I HAD.
I GOT TO BE THE PERSON PEOPLE
CAME TO AND THEN MADE A
DECISION.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WAS
ABLE TO RALLY PEOPLE TOGETHER TO
GET SOMETHING DONE THAT COULD
HAVE JUST BEEN A WHISPER IN THE
WIND.
 VERY GOOD.
BEST OF LUCK TO ALL THREE OF
YOU.
TAKE CARE.
 Jeff: JASON, YOU'RE UP.
 ALL RIGHTY.
IT'S TRUTH TIME.
I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M VOTING FOR.
MICHELE, THE NIGHT SCOT WENT
OUT, YOU VOTED TAI, YOU AND
JEWELA.
YOU GUYS HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THE
BLIND SIDE.
 RIGHT.
 YOU WEREN'T IN THAT ALLIANCE
BEFORE THAT WAS MADE.
 RIGHT.
 SOMEHOW YOU GOT IN.
THAT WAS THE MOVE THAT TURNED
THE WHOLE GAME FOR YOU.
WAS THAT LUCK OR DID YOU MAKE
THAT HAPPEN?
IF SO, HOW DID YOU MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?
 SO THE REASON THAT I WAS NOT
TOLD THE SCOT VOTE WAS BECAUSE
THAT ALLIANCE OF FOUR DID NOT
TRUST JULIA.
AT THAT POINT, I SAID, OKAY, YOU
KNOW, I'M WILLING TO VOTE OUT MY
TIGHTEST ALLIANCE IN ORDER TO
STRENGTHEN THIS NEW ALLIANCE.
WHEN JULIA WENT, TAI HAD WANTED
ME OUT NEXT RATHER THAN YOU.
BUT THEY TRUSTED ME MORE THAN
TRUSTED TAI, WHO FLIP-FLOPPED
THE WHOLE GAME.
SO I WORKED MY WAY.
IT WAS NOT LUCK.
I MADE MOVES IN ORDER TO GET
MYSELF THERE.
 APPRECIATE IT.
TAI, YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU HAD A
STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOT
UNTIL I CAME IN.
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON, JUST
HONESTLY, AND IT'S OKAY, WHY DID
YOU LEAVE US FOR THEM?
 I GOT SCARED.
I GOT SCARED OF YOUR BOND SO
STRONG.
I GOT SCARED THAT YOU GUYS WERE
GOING TO VOTE ME OUT, YOU KNOW,
AND MAYBE I GOT JEALOUS BETWEEN
YOU TWO MEN WHO TALK ABOUT MEN
STUFF, THE THING MEMBER TALK
ABOUT IS NOT WHAT I KNOW.
HOW YOU GO ABOUT IS SO SAVAGE,
AND THAT'S NOT HOW I DO WORK.
I DO GET SCARED.
 CALM DOWN, MARK.
 TO BE HONEST, THE MOST
GENUINE, I GOT SCARED OF YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOT.
 OKAY.
I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HONEST,
MAN.
 Jeff: THANKS, JASON.
CYDNEY, YOU'RE UP.
 HI, GUYS.
LONG TIME NO SEE.
AUBRY, GOING INTO THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, WAS IT ALWAYS
THE PLAN TO GET ME OUT?
 I DIDN'T WANT TO LET YOU GO
AT THAT POINT.
THE PLAN WAS THAT MICHELE WAS
GOING TO GO HOME THAT NIGHT, BUT
SHE WON IMMUNITY, SO I DECIDED
TO VOTE FOR YOU.
YOU WERE THE PERSON WHO WAS WITH
ME WITH EVERY DECISION ALONG IN
THE GAME.
YOU WERE THERE FOR THE NICK
VOTE, THE DEBBIE VOTE, THE SCOT
VOTE, SWITCHING THE VOTE FROM
MICHELE TO JASON.
THAT WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.
SO I HAD TO VOTE YOU OUT AT THAT
POINT, BECAUSE I KNEW THAT'S
WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
 MICHELE, I REALLY, REALLY
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU
GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD
FIRE WITH AUBRY.
YOU COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN LIKE,
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT A BLIND SIDE
ON MY ROSTER.
 CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
 DID YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE
BOTH VOTING CYDNEY GOING INTO
THAT TRIBAL?
 NO.
BUT I COULD HAVE FLIPPED.
AND I COULD HAVE EASILY SENT YOU
OUT, AND THE FACT IS, IF I HAD
KNOWN THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO
FOR YOU, THEN I WOULD HAVE TRIED
TO SAVE YOU IF I COULD HAVE.
I WANTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU.
 OKAY.
LOVE YOU GUYS.
 THANKS, CYDNEY.
 Jeff: SCOT.
 WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THE
MONKEY SAID WHEN THE LAWNMOWER
RAN OVER HIS SAIL...
 IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
TAI, WE WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THE
QUESTION.
YOU GOT AN IDOL, YOU DIDN'T USE
IT.
YOU GOT AN ADVANTAGE, AND YOU
USED IT IN A REAL DUMB WAY.
YOUR ALLIANCE DIDN'T TRUST YOU
SO YOU VOTED BOTH OF YOUR VOTES
FOR A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T GO
ANYWHERE.
NEW ENGLAND F NONE OF YOUR
ADVANTAGES DID YOU ANY GOOD.
 AUBRY?
 YES, SCOT?
 YOU STARTED OUT THIS GAME,
BUT "SURVIVOR" HAS THIS TWIST,
AND THAT TWIST IS NOW YOU GOT TO
MAKE US VOTE FOR YOU.
WHY WOULD I VOTE FOR YOU, AUBRY?
 I THINK YOU WOULD VOTE FOR
ME, SCOT, BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
SOMEONE WHO IS A COMPETITOR AND
CAN APPRECIATE THAT SOMEONE HAS
A DIFFERENT COMPETITIVE STYLE
THAN YOU, AND EVEN THOUGH IT
MIGHT NOT BE HOW YOU PLAYED THE
GAME, I PLAYED THE GAME WITH MY
STRENGTHS, WHICH WERE PERSONAL.
I THINK YOU CAN RESPECT THAT.
 MICHELE, IF THIS WAS FOUR
TRIBALS AGO AND SOMEBODY SAID
YOU THREE WOULD BE SITTING HERE,
I WOULD HAVE SAID YOU'RE LAST
PLACE.
GUESS WHAT YOU DID?
YOU OUTTOUGHED THOSE TWO.
TAI GOT WEAKER.
AUBRY GOT WEAKER.
YOU GOT STRONGER AS THIS GAME
WENT ALONG.
WELL DONE, MICHELE.
 Jeff: WELL, NORMALLY I
WOULD SAY WE'RE DONE, BUT I FEEL
COMPELLED TO GIVE EACH OF YOU A
CHANCE, IF THERE IS ANYTHING
THAT YOU THINK WAS LEFT UNSAID,
TO SAY IT RIGHT NOW.
SO AUBRY, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO
SAY, SAY IT.
 I CAME INTO THIS GAME, AND I
HAD A REALLY ROUGH START.
AND MY GAME EVOLVED AS I PLAYED.
I MADE DECISIONS THAT WEREN'T
EASY FOR ME.
I MANAGED A LOT OF PERSONALITIES
TO GET ME TO WHERE I AM NOW.
AND EVEN IF I DIDN'T WIN ALL
THOSE IMMUNITIES, DAMN DID I TRY
HARD.
I WON A REWARD CHALLENGE ON MY
OWN.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, I
CAME DOWN TO THE ULTIMATE
SURVIVOR MOMENT.
I MADE FIRE HERE.
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO THAT.
I LOVE THIS GAME.
I LOVE SEEING WHAT THIS GAME
BRINGS OUT IN YOU WHEN YOU GET
OUT HERE AND YOU JUST HAVE TO GO
AND PLAY.
I PLAYED MY HEART OUT.
I THINK I OUTWITTED.
I KNOW I OUTLASTED.
AND I WOULD SAY I OUTPLAYED.
 Jeff: TAI?
 THIS GAME IS SO HARD.
PEOPLE BACKSTABBING EACH OTHER.
WE DON'T NEED TO STAB EACH
OTHER.
I BELIEVE IN GOODNESS IN
HUMANITY.
I BELIEVE IN KINDNESS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S WHO I AM.
YOU KNOW, VIETNAMESE HAVE THIS
SAYING -- [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
IT'S LIKE LIFE IS LIKE A
HYACINTH PLANT FLOATING ON
WATER.
AND SOMEHOW THIS "SURVIVOR"
SEASON BROUGHT 18 OF US
TOGETHER, AND SOME PEOPLE WE
CLING ON TIGHTLY, AND WIND AND
WAVES BLOW US APART LIKE SCOT
AND I.
HOWEVER STRONG I WANT TO HOLD ON
THE SCOT, I COULDN'T, BUT IT'S
LIKE LIFE.
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE FLOAT ALONG THE
SAME PATH FOR A WHILE AND THEN
FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WILL
NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BUT
HAVE GREAT MEMORIES TOGETHER.
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK FOR.
 Jeff: THANKS, TAI.
MICHELE, ANY LAST WORDS?
 YEAH.
YOU KNOW, NICK SAID THAT I HAVE
TO BE INTELLIGENT TONIGHT, AND
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT I WASN'T
PLAYING AN INTELLIGENT GAME.
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO KEEP MY
COOL AND HAVE FAITH IN MYSELF
AND MY TEAM.
YOU KNOW, I HAD THE REALLY FIGHT
MY WAY HERE.
AND I THINK THAT I WAS UP
AGAINST A LOT OF ROADBLOCKS IN
THIS GAME.
AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD
FAITH IN ME WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE
WAS TELLING ME I WAS AT THE
BOTTOM.
AND I BELIEVED IN MYSELF AND I
TRUSTED MYSELF AND I REMAINED
HAPPY AND POSITIVE AND I'M PROUD
OF HOW I PLAYED, AND I'M JUST
PROUD OF MYSELF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL THE
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE A
$1 MILLION VOTE.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT.
LET IT ALL SOAK IN AND THEN WE
WILL VOTE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
JURY, TONIGHT YOU'RE VOTING FOR
A WINNER, THE PERSON YOU THINK
IS MOST DESERVING OF THE TITLE
OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THAT $1
MILLION CHECK THAT GOES ALONG
WITH IT.
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.
SCOT, YOU'RE UP.
 I PROMISED YOU I WOULD, AND
I'M STAYING TRUE TO THAT.
 NICE JOB, AUBRY.
WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE
VOTES.
OKAY.
BEFORE WE BRING THIS TO A CLOSE,
TAI, UNLESS YOU HAVE AN IDEA HOW
TO GET MARK THE CHICKEN BACK TO
AMERICA --
 I HAVE NO PLAN TO BRING MARK
TO AMERICA.
 Jeff: DO YOU WANT TO LET
MARK GO AND SAY GOOD-BYE?
 I DID EVERYTHING I CAN FOR
HIM UP TO THIS DAY, AND IT'S UP
TO FATE NOW.
COME ON.
GOOD-BYE.
HOPEFULLY HE WON'T BE SOMEONE'S
DINNER ANY TIME SOON.
 BYE, MARK.
 BYE, MARK.
 GO ON.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
AUBRY, TAI, MICHELE, JURY, I
WILL SEE YOU BACK IN AMERICA FOR
THE READING OF THE VOTES.
 SEE YOU, MARK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.
LET'S GET TO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
WOW.
AUBRY, TAI, MICHELE, I GOT TO
SAY, FROM START TO FINISH, YOU
REALLY DID HAVE TO EARN IT THIS
SEASON FROM THE HEAT TO THE
EVACUATIONS TO THE BLIND SIDES,
IT WAS NON-STOP DRAMA FROM START
TO FINISH.
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THIS, THE
LAST TWIST OF "SURVIVOR," A JURY
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU VOTED OUT,
NOW THEY DECIDE WHO WINS.
IT IS SOCIAL POLITICS IN THE
JUNGLE, AND IT'S DELICIOUS.
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL READ THE VOTES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FIRST VOTE, MICHELE.
AUBRY.
ONE VOTE MICHELE.
ONE VOTE AUBRY.
AUBRY.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
ONE VOTE MICHELE.
MICHELE.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES MICHELE.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
MICHELE.
THAT'S THREE VOTES MICHELE.
TWO VOTES AUBRY.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR,"
MICHELE.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR,"
MICHELE.
 OH, MY GOD!
 OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: IT WAS THE SEASON OF
THE UNDERDOG, AND MICHELE CAME
OUT ON TOP.
HERE'S YOUR CHECK, $1 MILLION.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING EVERYBODY
UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE
SEASON.
AUBRY, FROM OVERWHELMED, OH,
WOW, TO FINAL THREE AND A
FAVORITE.
PLUS WE HAD TAI, ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR TO EVER PLAY.
HE FOUND IDOLS, ADVANTAGE, EVEN
WENT TO THE DARK SIDE, AND THE
DARK SIDE STILL HAUNTS HIM.
IT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE SCARIEST
SITUATIONS EVER WHEN CALEB WAS
EVACUATED.
WE'LL GET UPDATES ON EVERYTHING.
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR" LIVE REUNION
SHOW NEXT.
