         Anchor: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"... AT THE BRAIN
TRIBE, DEBBIE'S ODDBALL
BEHAVIOR --
 WE HAVE THE BIGGEST.
 Jeff: -- MARKED HER AS AN
EARLY PAWN.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, THE
BRAINS TO HAVE NO GAME.
 Jeff: AT THE BEAUTY TRIBE,
THE WOMEN'S ALLIANCE WAS GROWING








STRONGER.
 THE GIRL'S ALLIANCE FELT
NATURAL TO ME.
 Jeff: WHILE TAI'S HUNT FOR
THE IDOL --
 YOU WILL NEED A KEY TO OPEN
THIS BOX.
 Jeff: -- WAS GROWING MORE
DESPERATE.
 I CANNOT GET THE IDOL.
 Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, BRAWN LOST AGAIN.
SENDING BRAWN BACK THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.








FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, ALECIA
APPEARED THE OBVIOUS VOTE.
 BLONDIE, SHE'S USELESS.
 BUT JENNY WAS HAVING SECOND
THOUGHTS.
 JASON IS STARTING TO PISS ME
OFF.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMEñr
BACK-AND-FORTH, WHAT DO WE DO.
 Jeff: JENNY REVEALED HER
INDECISION.
 NEW I'M WONDERING.
 Jeff: SAVING ALECIA FOR THE
SECOND TRIBAL COUNCIL IN A ROW.
JENNY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 ALECIA, JUST SO YOU KNOW, I
WAS THE OTHER PERSON THAT WROTE
YOUR NAME DOWN, BUT I ALREADY
KNOW WE HAD THREE VOTES TO SEND
JENNY HOME AND I PROMISED HER I
WOULDN'T WRITE HER NAME DOWN.
THAT'S ALL.
 OKAY.
 THAT'S IT.
NO HARD FEELINGS.
 I DON'T GET WHY YOU WOULD
WRITE MY NAME DOWN IF JENNY WAS
ALREADY GOING HOME.
 I JUST TOLD YOU.
 THAT'S COOL.
 I'M A LOYAL PERSON.
 SCOTT SAID, I ONLY WROTE YOUR
NAME DOWN BECAUSE I KNEW JENNY
WAS GOING HOME.
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING I
THINK I'VE EVER HEARD.
 WE'RE GOING TO THE WATERWELL.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WROTE MY
NAME DOWN.
 IF YOU BREAK MY TRUST ONCE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT BACK.
SCOT IS A MILLIONAIRE.
HE PLAYED FOR THE NBA FOR TEN
YEARS.
 YEAH.
 ALECIA JUST BAFFLED ME DAY IN
AND DAY OUT.
SHE THINKS WE'RE ALIED AND IT'S
US AGAINST THEM, BUT SHE DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW HOW CLOSE I AM WITH
THE GUYS.
I JUST KEEP GOING, UH-HUH, THAT
SOUNDS GOOD, I'M DOWN, WHATEVER
YOU WANT, I'M DOWN.
 I REALLY THINK WE MADE A
MISTAKE TONIGHT.
HERE'S WHY: THE NEXT CHALLENGE
WE HAVE THREE AND A HALF PEOPLE.
 ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS WITH
THAT VOTE, I THINK SHE TRUSTS ME
MORE, THEREFORE THAT MEANS
THAT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US.
 SHE DEFINITELY WANTS ME GONE
NOW.
 SHE DEFINITELY DOES.
 THINGS CHANGED A LOT TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL.
I HAVE LOST ONE OF THE THREE
ORIGINAL ALLIANCE THAT I WANTED,
AND NOW ALECIA IS VERY MUCH
EMPOWERED, AND SHE COULD MAKE
TROUBLE FOR ME.
 WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY
MAKES.
 GUYS, BREAKFAST IS READY.
 I'LL EAT THE REST OF THAT.
 FISHING, I DO EVERYTHING.
 EVERYBODY IS WATCHING
EVERYBODY LIKE A HAWK, BUT I'M
GETTING THE IDOL RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S IT.
ONE CHANCE.
THAT'S MY ONLY CHANCE.Ñi
I THINK THE THAT THE TRIBE, THEY
IKE ME AS Añr PERSON, BUT I KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE IT IS.
I JUST HAVE TO GET THE KEY OUT.
I NEED TO GET A STICK, ATTACH A
TOOL, AND POKE THE CANISTER, AND
PUSH THE KEY OUT.
 NO, DON'T TELL ME.
 THIS IS SO STUPID.
 DON'T TELL ME I LEFT IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.Ñi
SOMEHOW I LOST THE TOOL.
I WAS SO MAD AT MYSELF.
NOTHINGÑi IN MY LIFE COME EASY,
YOU KNOW, INCLUDING THIS IDOL.
I SEE YOU.
PEEKABOO.
MY WHOLE LIFE IS FULL OF
CHALLENGES.
IN VIETNAM, REFUGEE CAMP, COMING
TO AMERICA, REINVENTING MYSELF,
AND THIS IS ANOTHER BIG
CHALLENGE.
SO I SHOULD MAKE MYSELF ANOTHER
TOOL FROM A STICK.
PLEASE, PLEASE, COME HOME WITH
ME.
ñrñr
GO IN THERE, BABY.
YES, YES!
YES!
OH, MY GOSH.
OH, THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOUND THE KEY TO THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
FOLLOW THE MAP TO UNLOCK YOUR
TREASURE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, TREE.ñr
THIS IS WAY, WAY, WAY TOO LONG.
COME TO PAPA.
HERE IT COMES.
OH, THERE IT IS.
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GOING TO
SAVE MY LIFE.
THIS IS GOING TO SAVE MY LIFE.
I FOUND THE IDOL.
I WORKED SO HARD FOR THIS.
JEFF MAKE IT SO... IT'S NOT
EASY, BUT I NEVER GIVE UP.
THIS IDOL AND I BELONG TOGETHER.
THIS IDOL MUST BE USED AFTER ALL
THE VOTES ARE CAST.
THERE IS ANOTHER IMMUNITY IDOL.
A SUPER IDOL CAN BE PLAYED AFTER
THE VOTE HAS BEEN READ.
WHOA!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
EVEN AFTER THE VOTE HAS BEEN
READ?
WO IDOLSÑi THAT FIT TOGETHER CAN
FORM ONE SUPER IDOL.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THAT'S THE BIG TWIST THIS
SEASON.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 SO HERE WE ARE STRATEGICALLY
PLANNING HOW TO WIN THIS GAME,
AND WE HAVE Añr GUY WORKING OVER
HERE.$ &C @&C
INÑi PART OF ONEñr CORE ALLIANCE
TH LIS, BUT WE'RE MANAGING TWOó
SEPARATE GROUPS OF TWO, SO WE'RE
IN CONTROL.
 I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE
TO TAKE OUT DEBBIE OR JOE.
 I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HIM IN
THE END AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
THAT'S A GUARANTEE FOR ME.
 PETER ANDRY LOOKING FOR A
TIGHTER GROUP OF MORE LOYAL
PLAYERS THE SHIP DIDN'T SHEPHERD
INTO THE MASTERING.
DEBBIE SEEMS GREAT.
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE DRIVE
TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.
SHE'S LIKE A COURT JESTER.
JOE SEEMS LIKE A REAL GESTURE.
AUBRY DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE GAME OR THAT KIND OF THING.
NEAL IS VERY SMART, AND HE'S A
HUGE RISK TO BLINDSIDE ONE OF US
COME A SWAP OR A MERGE.
> I THINK JUST SPLIT THE VOTE.ó
 SO WE TELL THEM TO VOTE FOR
NEAL.
WE VOTE FOR AUBRY?
 YES.
 WE'RE DOING THIS, WE'RE
THINKING OF WHAT WE HAVE.
WE'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER AND
MAKING A GOOD PLAN.
 I THINK WE HAVE OUR FINGER ON
THE PULSE.
 MY POSITION IN THIS TRIBE IS
TO SIT BACK, OBSERVE, SHUT UP
AND GATHER INTEL.
PETER REALLY FEELS SUPERIOR, AND
LIS IS OUR PRIMA DONNA PRINCESS.
THEIR GOAL IS TO TAKE THE REST
OF US OUT WHILE WE DO THE HARD
WORK, AND RIGHT NOW PETER IS AN
ASSET AT CHALLENGES.
SO THE PERSON THAT NEEDS TO GO
IS LIS.
I SEE THAT CLEARLY.
I THINK IF WE PULLED IN AUBRY
AND NEAL, WE HAVE A SOLID FOUR,
AND WE BLINDSIDE LIS.
SHE'S A FREAKING PRIMA DONNA WHO
BITCHES AND KNOWS EVERYTHING.
 OKAY.
 DO YOU HEAR ME?
 YES.
 WE HAVE TO GET WITH THAT FOUR
BEFORE LIS AND PETER BEAT US TO
IT.
TO SPLIT UP LIS AND PETER, WE
NEED TO BE SUBVERSIVE.
WE NEED TO IMPLANT
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE.
WE NEED TO MOVE WITH A PURPOSE,
JOE.
AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.
SO LET ME ASK YOU FLAT OUT, HOW
DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NEAL IN THIS
GAME?
 I FEEL LIKE HE'S SHOOTING
STRAIGHT WITH ME.
 OKAY.
 I DO, TOO.
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 I'M TELLING YOU THAT I LIKE
HIM.
 OKAY.
I WAS STARTING TO GET THAT
FEELING.
 GOOD, GOOD.
 OKAY, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
WHEN YOU GET INTO A BATTLE WITH
ME, BE PREPARED FOR ME TO USE
BETTER, SMARTER TACTICS.
THE BARN DOORS ARE OPEN.
PREPARE TO FIRE.
I TOTALLY TRUST YOU AND I HOPE
WE HAVE A SOLID PERSON.
 OKAY.
 THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT
WHAT I'M DOING IS NOBODY REALLY
PAYS ATTENTION TO ME, AND THAT'S
PRECISELY WHAT I WANT TO DO, FLY
UNDER THE RADAR.
ALL THE WHILE, I'M SITTING BACK
GATHERINGñr INTEL BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW YOU PLAY THIS GAME, BABY.
 LOOKINGÑi FORWARD TO EATING
THAT CHICKEN.
 UH-HUH.
I THINK THE ONE WITH THE LESS
FEATHERS WOULD BE BETTER.
 IT'S FATTER.
 SO WE'LL KILL THAT ONE.
KILLING THE CHICKEN IS BEST FOR
OUR TRIBE.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALL HUNGRY.
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE ATTACHED TO
ANIMALS.
TAI IS ONE OF THEM PEOPLE.
THAT SHOWS A SENSITIVE SIDE OF
TAI.
AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE HERE FOR HIM BECAUSE HE
HAS A HARD TIME WITH STUFF LIKE
THAT.
 HEAR THAT SOUND?
THEY'RE CONTENT.
 VERY COMFORTABLE.
 BREATH IN, BREATHE IN.
 TO ME WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TO
KILL THAT CHICKEN, BUT THE BOYS
NEED PROTEIN TO STAY STRONG FOR
CHALLENGES.
IT IS THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
WE NEED TO EAT SOMETHING.
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.
 I HAVE TO GRAB ITS HEAD A
CERTAIN WAY.
SO YOU MAY HAVE TO HOLD IT.
 SORRY, GUYS.
COME BACK FOR A BETTER LIFE.
 JUST THE SLIGHT OF LIFE
DERANGE OUT OF MY HAND, I FEEL
LIKE I DID WRONG, A LOT OF
WRONG.
 HE'S DEAD.
 YOU KNOW IT HAS TO BE DONE.
IT'S STILL VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO GO THROUGH.
IT'S STILL A LIFE THAT YOU TOOK.
 IT'S SAD.
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CRY.
 TAI?
OH, YEAH, HE'S UPSET.
TAI'S GOT THESE FEELINGS AND
EMOTIONS THAT HE HAS TO GET OUT.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE PLAY THIS
GAME.
MY FRIENDS WOULD COMPARE ME TO,
YEAH, A ROBOT OR JUST LIKE
COLD-BLOODED.
BUT YOU DON'T NEED EMOTIONS OUT
HERE.
YOU JUST NEED TO SEEM LIKE YOUR
HAVE EMOTIONS.
 HE'SÑi HURTING.
YOU CAN TELL.
 I FEEL BAD.
 TAI WILL BE OKAY.
ANIMALS EAT OTHER ANIMALS.
 THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
NICK THAT I DON'T TRUST.
HE'S SO DIFFICULT TO TALK TO.
HE HAS SUCH A FAKE SMILE AND HE
JUST REALLY RUBS ME THE WRONG
WAY.
I DOó TRUST CALEB.
I TRUST TAI.
SO IF WE HAVE THREE GIRLS AND
THREE GUY, WE NEED TO PULL OVER
ONE OF THE GUYS.Ñi
HERE'S THE THING, THE GIRLS ARE
GOING TO STAY TOGETHER, AND
OSE GIRLSÑi AND ARE SUPER LOYAL.
IT'S A GAME.ó
I WOULD NEVER BACKSTAB YOU LIKE
THAT EVER.Ñi
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THOUGH, I
DON'T TRUST NICK.
I DON'T.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, I DO NOT.
 I THINK THE GIRLS ARE A VERY
STRONG THREE.
AND ANNA THROWS OUT A PROPOSAL
AT SHE WANTS ME TO BE WITH THEÑi
GIRLS, AND WE'LL GET RID OF
NICK.
I DON'T SEE THAT AS A BAD THING
BECAUSE IF WE DO LOSE, THAT
MEANS ME NOT GOING HOME.
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE...
THERE WILL BE LOSS OF DRAMA.
 I'M NOT TRYING THE FIND THIS
IDOL BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST
ALECIA.
THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES AND
IMMUNITY IDOL COULD HIDE.
IF THERE IS A CLUE OUT THERE FOR
THE IDOL, THE LAST PERSON WE
WOULD WANT THE FIND IT IS
OBVIOUSLY ALECIA.
 I'M OVER BY THIS TREE.
 I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'M AT
THE BOTTOM, AND THEN I SEE A
CLUE TO AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
IT'S POWER IN THIS GAME.
IF4
GET IT, BOOM, YOU'RE AT THE TOP.
 I GO FOR A LITTLE WALK, SURE
ENOUGH, THERE'S ALECIA AND
CYDNEY DIGGING.
I KNOW WHAT'S UP INSTANTLY.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.
 OH, SHOOT.
 NOW THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
IT'S UP A TREE.
WE HAVE THE FIND IT.
 ALECIA, ALECIA.ó
Ñi SO I FOUND THE IDOL.
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SHE'S GONE.
 I WAITED FOR ALECIA THE WALK
OFF BECAUSE I FOUND A LITTLE
TOOL WITH THIS CLUE, M
LIKE, OH, I START DIGGING AND
DIGGING AND I HATE SOMETHING
HARD.
I SCRAPED IT WITH MY FINGERS.
IT SAYS IDOL ON IT.
TRIED TO OPEN THE BOX.
IT HAS A LOCK.
I'M LIKE, HOW THE HELL AMó I
SUPPOSED TO GET UP IN THE BOX.
NEXT THING I KNOW, I HURRIED UP
AND COVERED IT UP.
 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.
 THE HOE?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE HOE?
 OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.Ñi
 OKAY.
WANT THE RINSE OUT MY HAIR.óñr
 SHE FOUND A CLUE?
 UH-HUH.
 WHAT DID IT SAY?
THEÑi IDOL IS BURIED BY A TREE.
 WHICH TREE?
 THE ONE YOU SAW US AT.
 OF COURSE, HE SAW US, SO I
HAVE TO TELL HIM ANYWAY.ó
HAVEÑi TO MAKE IT SO THEY DON'T
THINK I'M ACTUALLY ALIGNED WITH
HER.
I AMñr POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST
BOUNTY HUNT CENTERS SOUTHEAST
MICHIGAN.
THE TREE WAS OVER HERE THAT THEY
WERE DIGGING.
 WAS IT THIS TREE?
 NO, I CAUGHT THEM OVER HERE.
 IF SOMEONE GIVES ME A TIP IN
MY WORK, YOU GOT SECONDS,
MINUTES, HOURS MAYBE.
SO YOU MOVE.
I TRY AND TREAT THIS GAME LIKE
HOW I TREAT MY JOB.
 I GOT IT.
 WHAT'S IT SAY?
 I FOUND IT PRETTY QUICKLY.
I FIND THE CLUE.
Z,,"S" A BOX.
IT'S LOCKED AND THE LITTLE CLUE
HAS A MAP.
I HAD TO MOVE.
 IS IT THE IDOL OR A CLUE TO
IT?
 I JUST TOOK OFF LIKE A BAT
OUT OF HELL.
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP UP OR GET
LEFT BEHIND.ñr
 CONGRATULATION, YOU FOUND THE
IMMUNITY IDOL.
FIRST YOU WILL NEED A KEY TO
OPEN THIS BOX.
 THE MAP WAS PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY.
AND THEN IT'S JUST LOOKING,
PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL,
WHAT'S DIFFERENT, WHAT'S
MISSING?
 THERE IT IS.
I FOUND THE DIE.
THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT OUT WAS
TO PUSH THROUGH A LITTLE HOLE AT
THE BOTTOM, BUT THE TOOL IS
GONE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
IT GOT FLUNG SOMEWHERE.
THE GIRLS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
WAS.
WHO KNOWS.
 YOU TOLD HIM?
 NO.
HE SAW US.
PERIOD.
 OH.
 SCOT AND I MAKELA SHIFT TOOL
TO GET THE KEY.
SURE ENOUGH, BLONDIE IS WAITING
THERE TO TRY AND SNATCH IT.
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
IT'S ON.ÑiíRÑ
 UP.
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.
RIGHT THERE.
 GET OUT OF THERE.
 I GOT IT, SCOT!
IN THIS GAME, IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING, YOU GOT TO GO GET IT.
IT WAS NICE HAVING AN NBA PLAYER
ON MY SIDE, ESPECIALLY A CENTER.
THAT HEIGHT PAID OFF.ñr
 THE BURIED TREASURE.
 THAT'S THE SWEETEST THING
I'VE SEEN IN A WEEK.
 I WAS THE ONE WHO FOUND THE
CLUE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY JASON
HAS THE IDOL.
THIS WHOLE THING WAS JUST
COMPLETELY CONFUSING.
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.
HONESTLY, AT THIS POINT I DON'T
TRUST ANYONE ON MY TRIBE.
IT'S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER.
FIRST I'M ON THE TOP, AND NOW I
THINK I'M BACK ON THE BOTTOM.
 THERE'S A TWIST, IF YOU PAIR
ONE IMMUNITY IDOL WITH ANOTHER,
THEY FIT TOGETHER LIKE A
SUPERIDOL.
THE SUPERIDOL CAN BE PLAYED
AFTER THE VOTES HAVE BEEN READ.
YING AND YANG.
IF WE GET THE OTHER ONE, THEN
IT'S LIKE THEY CAN VOTE US OUT
ALL THEY WANT.
WONDER TWIN POWERS ACTIVATE.
GUESS WE'RE STICKING AROUND.
IDOL TIME, BABY.
IT'S IN THE RIGHT HANDS.
I'VE FROZEN MINE, BUT I'M PRETTY
CONFIDENT JASON WILL TAKE CARE
OF ME.
WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
ALECIA DIDN'T HAVE IT, BECAUSE
CHALLENGE, I DON'T SEE HOW WE
WIN.
W SHE'SÑi OUTNUMBERED AND SHE'LL
BE NEXT.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE
NEW BRAWN TRIBE.

TO A BOAT WHERE YOU'LL RETRIEVE
THREE BAGS OF RICE.
YOU'LL WORK TOGETHER PUSHING AND
PULLING THOSE BAGS THROUGH A
HOLE.
YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOUR WAY ACROSS
THE BALANCE BEAM AND UP TO THE
BEACH WHERE YOU WILL TEAR OPEN
THE BAGS, SEARCHING FOR THREE
BALLS.
THEN ONE TRIBE MEMBER AT A TIME
MUST BALANCE ON A BEAM WHILE
ATTEMPTING TO MANEUVER A BALL
THROUGH A MAZE OF HOLES TO THE
TOP.
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO GET ALL

IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

SECONDS.
AND CYDNEY IS CLOSE.
DEBBIE CLOSE.Ñi
BRAWN DOES IT BY SECONDS OVER
THE BRAIN TRIBE.ó
THE BRAIN TRIBE IS GOING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE THIRD PERSON VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.
 ABOUT TIME SOMETHING WORKEDÑi
OUT FOR US.ñr
 Jeff: BEAUTY TRIBE, ONCE

HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
BRAWN TRIBE, COME GRAB YOUR

 Jeff: JASON WITH THE TEDDY
BEAR.
ALL RIGHT.
BRAIN TRIBE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE THIRD PERSON VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME, THE FIRST
PERSON TO BE VOTED OUT OF YOUR
TRIBE.
GRAB YOURó STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 WE LOST THE CHALLENGE, BUT NO
PROBLEM BECAUSE LIS ANDLY GO
DOWN THE HIT LIST LIKE A
MOBSTER.
THE FIRST IS NEAL.
THE GAME IS THE GAME.
MONEY IS MONEY.
"SURVIVOR" IS "SURVIVOR."
 ALL AROUND, GUYS, A
SPECTACULAR JOB, AND I MEAN I
WAS THREE SECONDS BEHIND HER.
 IT WAS JUST MATTER OF
SECONDS.
IT'S IN THE LIKE WE IMPLODED
THERE.
 RIGHT.
 AS A LONG-TERM SOLUTION,
LOSING TODAY WAS GOOD FOR ME AND
PETER, BECAUSE WE CAN SEND NEAL
HOME AND NEAL'S GOING TO BE THE
PLAYER THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS DOWN
THE ROAD.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TELL AUBRY AND NEAL THAT JOE IS
GOING HOME TONIGHT, BUT THE
ACTUAL PLAN IS THE REMAINING
FOUR WILL BE SPLITTING THE VOTES
BETWEEN NEAL AND AUBRY IN CASE
NEAL HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THE IDEA IS TO SIMPLIFY THE
PROCESS FOR JOE AND DEBBIE.
THEY JUST NEED THE WRITE DOWN
NEAL, REMEMBER IT'S NEAL WE'RE
GOING FOR AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT ANYTHING
COMPLICATED.
T WILL WORK ISñr FORóÑiPa&C @&C
SO IN THE EVENT THAT NEAL
DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL, WE'LL END
UP WITH Aó 2-2-2 TIE.ó
AND THEN I%
VOTE OUT NEAL.
 OKAY.
Ñi I'M SO CONFIDENT THIS IS
GOING TO WORK THE WAY WE WANT IT
TO.
I THINK LOSING TODAY WAS A
BLESSING IN DISGUISE.
 HOW ABOUT THAT.
SO LIZ APPROACHED ME.
SHE WANTS JOE AND I TO VOTE FOR
NEAL AND FOLLOW ORDERS LIKE A
GOOD SOLDIER.Ñi
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
> I'M REALLY GLAD WE'RE ONñ2HHE
SAME PAGEÑi ABOUT.
THIS I JUST DON'T WANT, TALK
ABOUT ITñr OVERLY.K
Ñi FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, YOU AND
I, DONE DEAL.
WHEN I KNOW SOMEBODY IS SNOWING
ME, I CAN GIVE IT BACK TO YOU IN
SPADES.
THE FACT IS SHE IS ABSOLUTELY
OBLIVIOUS TO THE REALITY OF
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
 THEY'RE VOTING FOR AUBRY.
IÑi -- THEY THINK YOU HAVE THE
IDOL.
 I KNOW NOW LIS AND PETER HAVE
BEEN WHISPERING LITTLE LIES AND
MAKING IT SOUND LIKE I HAVEñr AN
IDOL.
AS A RESULT, THEY NEED TO BE
PUNISHED.ñrÑi
 YEAH, I KNOW.
ALTHOUGH LIS AND I ARE
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE AND WE HAVE
GREAT SMILES, WE'RE ACTUALLY OUT
FOR BLOOD.
EVERYONE ELSE, THEY'RE LIKE CLAY
THAT WE MOLD.
THEY ARE INDECISIVE UNLESS GIVEN
A DECISION.
THEY NEED PATERNAL DIRECTION,
AND I'M BEING THAT PATERNAL
PERSON, PROVIDING THEM DIRECTION
IN THE WAY I WANT THEM TO VOTE.
IT'S A GREAT PLACE.
 YOU ANDó NEAL...
 I GUESS I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
BEFORE.
PETER IS VERY CONTROLLING.
I JUST CAN'T TRUST SOMEONE WHO
IS REVEALING THEMSELVES RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME EVERY DAY BY OPENING
THEIR MOUTH.
HE DOESN'T HAVE EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, AND I DON'T KNOW
IFó THAT'S SOMEONE YOU CAN MOVE
FORWARD WITH.
DEBBIE ORIGINALLY DECIDED TO
TARGET LIS, BUT FOR ME, PETER IS
THE BIGGEST THREAT.
I WANT TO TALK TO DEBBIE AND
FIGURE THIS OUT.
 PETER SAID SOMETHING TO THE
EFFECT, HEY, WE'RE VOTING OUT
JOE.
STOP TRYING TO CONTROL ME.
IS IT LIKE THEY'RE RUNNING
THINGS?
 IT'S JUST THE GOAL LINE.
 I JUST DON'T LIKE BOYS.
MY BIGGEST REGRET IN THIS GAME
WOULD BE IF WE TOOK PETER TOO
FAR AND HE SCREWED US.
 YOU WANT TO GET RID OF PETER?
WE STILL HAVE TARGET, LIS, BUT
PETEER IS PLAYING THIS GAME WITH
AN OVEREXUBERANCE, AND HE'S
Ny
THE LONG HAUL SERIOUS TROUBLE
FOR THE BRIN TRIBE.
LIS AND PETER WILL SLIT
ANYBODY'S THROAT IN THIS GAME
GIVE AN SPLIT SECOND, SO IT'S A
BIG DECISION, BUT TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A TOTAL
BLINDSIDE, AND IT'S GOING TO BE
UGLY WHEN WE GET HOME, KIDS.
[LAUGHING]
TOTAL BLIND SIDE.
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
SO PETER, ANY TIME YOU HAVE A
GROUP OF STRANGERS, SOME PEOPLE
WILL GET ALONG.
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT GET ALONG.
DID YOU NOTICE ANY FRIENDSHIPS
FORMING EARLY?
 ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE LIS AND I
CLICKED.
AUBRY AND NEAL.
I CLICKED WITH THEM, AS WELL.
I THINK THERE'S AN AGE
DIFFERENCE WITH DEBBIE AND JOE,
BUT WITH DAYS GOING ON, I THINK
WE ALL CLICK TOGETHER.
 Jeff: DOES THAT MEAN THERE
ARE THREE PAIRS VOTING IN A
SIMILAR FASHION TONIGHT?
 YEAH, I WOULD CONSIDER THESE
THREE VOTING UNITS.
 Jeff: SO IS IT FAIR TO
ASSUME FROM THE BRAIN TRIBE THAT
EVERYTHING IS MATHEMATICAL OR
PRAGMATIC?
DEBBIE, YOU'RE NODDING ALREADY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
WE ARE OVERLY ANALYTICAL.
WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEST TO GATHER
FACTS, THINK IT THROUGH WITHOUT
PANICKING, REASSESS, REANALYZE,
AND EMOTIONS JUST A WASTE OF
TIME OR ENERGY.
 OR MAYBE WE EACH THINK WE'RE
THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE GAME
AND WE'LL BE FINE.
 Jeff: AUBRY, WHICH ONE OF
THOSE IS CLOSEST TO THE TRUTH?
YOU'RE ALL VERY ANALYTICAL AND
FOCUSING ON EMOTION OR YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT THINKS YOU'VE
FIGURED IT OUT.
 IT'S MURKY WATER.
YOU CAN HAVE THE NUMBERS AND
FEEL 100% CONFIDENT, BUT THERE
ARE COMMENTS OR SILENCES, AND
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHa(Ñ THOSE
MEANS TOO, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
NOT NUMBERS.
 Jeff: SO PETER, AUBRY IS
TALKING ABOUT PICKING UP ON THE
SUBTLETIES OF SOCIAL
INTERACTIONS.
 ABSOLUTELY.
AS AN E.R. DOCTOR, SOCIAL
INTERACTION IS WHAT I'M A
PROFESSIONAL IN.
 Jeff: LIS, LET'S TALK ABOUT
PARANOIA.
IT COMES INTO EVERY TRIBE AT
SOME POINT.
IS IT ALREADY ON THE BRAIN TRIBE
TO SOME DEGREE?
 I'D SAY PARANOIA IS A STRONG
WORD.
BUT IF ANYBODY IS HERE AND
DOESN'T HAVE FEAR THAT THERE'S
SOME CONSPIRACY OUT TO GET THEM,
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT THINKING
ENOUGH ABOUT HOW TO PLAY.
 Jeff: JOE, GOING OFF WHAT
LIS IS SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A
BASELINE PAIR NOWBACK DOES YOUR
PAST CAREER PLAY INTO THAT?
ó I'M ALWAYS KIND OF SUSP
I JUST HAVE THAT INNER SUSPICION
ABOUT PEOPLE, MOTIVES AND
THINGS.
MANY TIMES CROOKS HAVE COME OUT
WITH GREAT SMILES, LOOKED GOOD,
BELIEVABLE, BUT THEY'RE NOT.
COULD BE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: PETER, PRETTY
INTERESTING STATEMENT.T&
COVER OUT HERE.
 I DO JUDGE A BECOME BY ITS
COVER.
JOE, HE'S A POLICE OFFICER, HE'S
BEEN AN F.B.I. AGENT FOR 25
YEARS, SO WHATEVER HE TELLS ME,
I BELIEVE.
 Jeff: I WOULD JUST
REFERENCE THE FIRST TIME WE DID
BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS
BEAUTY, IT WAS WON BY TONY, ALSO
A COP, WHO LIED EVERY HALF HOUR.
[LAUGHTER]
 I AGREE, AND I THINK JOE IS
IN A DIFFERENT GENERATION.
HIS WORD MEANS A LOT MORE TO ME
THAN A GUY LIKEÑi TONY.Ñi
 Jeff:ñr PETER, WHAT WAS THE
VIBE BACK AT CAMP AFTER THE
LOSS?
 WEÑi FELT TERRIBLE, BUT I
STARTED TO REASSURE MYSELF THAT
THE PLAN IS GOINGó FORWARD.
 Jeff: NEAL, WHEN YOU HEqRrÑi
ONE TR
IN PLACE, UNLESS YOU'RE PART OF
THAT PLAN, IT'S GOT TO MAKE YOU
GO...
 I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHICH
PLAN IS HE TALKING ABOUT.
 WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR PLAN.
 WOW.
 Jeff: PETER?
 LET'S JUST BREAK THIS DOWN,
THE GUY IN ICE CREAM PANTS COULD
BE A SNAKE IN ICE CREAM PANT,
RIGHT?
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A PLAN.
IF WE WANT TO GET NEAL OR AUBRY
OUT, WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTE AND
FORGE AHEAD AS THE BRAINS.
 Jeff: SO DEBBIE, PETEER IS
FLAT-OUT DICTATING WHAT HE WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE HAPPEN.
 GOOD FOR HIM FOR THROWING IT
ALL OUT THERE.
 Jeff: LIS, DO YOU THINK
TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL GO ACCORDING
TO "THE PLAN."
 I THINK THE PERSON WHO GOES
HOME TONIGHT WILL NOT BE
COMPLETELY SHOCKED.
 Jeff: NEAL HOW ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE
RESULT OF TONIGHT'S VOTE?
WHAT'S YOUR HOPE?
 I THINK WE'LL GO FORWARD AS A
STRONGER TRIBE.
NOW WHAT STRONGER MEANS WILL BE
INTERPRETED LATER.
 Jeff: PETER, THAT
SELF-AWARENESS IS KEY.
 OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
ONE THING I DO KNOW IS I LIKE
ALL THESE PEOPLE.
I RESPECT SOME OF THEIR GAME
PLAY.
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
THERE ARE THREE PAIRS, SO WHAT
DO YOU WANT?
LIS ANDRY BOTH SMART PEOPLE.
WE THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I WANT TO TAKE PEN TO PARCHMENT
AND PUT SOME NAMES DOWN.
 Jeff: SHALL WE VOTE IN
 WE'RE READY.
 WE'RE READY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
IT IS TIME THE VOTE.
AUBRY, YOU'RE UP.
 THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE
AROUND YOU, BUT GOOD LUCK.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, AUBRY.
AUBRY.
PETE.
PETER.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES AUBRY, TWO
VOTES PETER.
LIZ.
ONE VOTE LIZ.
TWO VOTES PETER, TWO VOTES
AUBRY, ONE VOTE LEFT.
LIZ.
WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE.
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE.
AUBRY, LIZ, PETER, YOU WILL NOT
VOTE.
EVERYBODY ELSE YOU CAN ONLY VOTE
FOR ONE OF THOSE THREE.
JOE, IF YOU'LL GRAB THE URN.
I'LL GO GET THE VOTES.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE LIZ.
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF BRAINS
VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS BEAUTY, LIZ,
THAT'S TWO, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
LIZ, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.Ñi
 Jeff: WELL, FOR ALL THE
TALK TONIGHT ABOUT HOW SMART
THIS TRIBE IS, THE VOTE
ILLUSTRATES THAT "SURVIVOR" IS
ALWAYS ABOUT EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, YOUR ABILITY TO
PICK UP ON SOCIAL CUES.
THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU TO THE END.
GRABÑiÑi YOURÑi TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OURT&
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE MOST PUNISHING
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."ó
SEE THE EXHAUSTION.
MEDICAL!
THE SEASON CONTINUES THE TAKE
ITS TOLL.
 WE NEED WATER, WATER, WATER!
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN
EVACUATIONñr.
CALL FOR THE CHOPPER.
 I WAS VERY CONFIDENT THAT
WHETHER WE WON OR LOST THINGS
WOULD WORK OUT FOR ME, AND I
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
HAT MADE MY TRIBE WANT TOÑi VOTE
ME OUT TONIGHT.
I DON'T THINK THE NUMBERS LIED
TO ME, IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO LIED
TOm
AND WHEN YOU COUNTÑi FICTITIOUS
PROMISES, YOU GET A FICTITIOUS
