         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," EVERYTHING SEEMED TO
BE GOING RIGHT FOR TAI.
 I HAVE POWER NOW.
 Jeff: HE HAD AN IDOL, AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME...
 YOU WON YOURSELF AN EXTRA
VOTE.
 Jeff: AND AN ALLIANCE OF
FIVE.
BUT JASON AND JULIA SAW THAT TAI








WAS THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE
GAME.
 IT'S STUPID NOT TO GET RID OF
TAI.
 Jeff: AND THEY TRIED TO
CONVINCE CYDNEY AND MICHELE TO
TAKE TAI OUT.
 GETTING RID OF TAI IS
CRUCIAL.
 Jeff: WHICH LEFT CYDNEY AND
MICHELE WITH A BIGSBEE DECISION.
 IT'S NICE TO HAVE OPTIONS.
 Jeff: TO TAKE OUT THE
BIGGEST THREAT OR VOTE OFF ONE








OF MY SHILL'S CLOSEST ALLIES.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, JASON MADE
HIS CASE FOR VOTING OUT TAI.
 I STARTED FLIPPING MORE THAN
A FLAPJACK.
HE'S DONE IT TWO TIMES ALREADY.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE WON'T
BE A THIRD?
 Jeff: BUT MICHELE AND
CYDNEY STUCK WITH THE MAJORITY
AND SENT JULIA TO THE JURY.
JEWELBACK THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING JASON ALONE TO FEND FOR
HIMSELF.
SIX ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 I WAS FEARFUL.
I ALMOST PLAYED MY IDOL.
I DID.
I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID, WHAT
SHOULD I DO?
IT SCARED ME.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A LITTLE
HEATED.
PEOPLE NOW CAN SEE I CAN PREACH.
I KNOW HOW TO TALK.
I DO IT EVERY DAY IN MY JOB.
I MAKE MOTHERS WRAP THEIR SONS
UP.
WE ALL GOT HERE.
 WE GOT HERE.
 WE GOT HERE.
 YOU HAVE TO PICK YOU
OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY COME.
NOW IS THE TIME TO START MAKING
CHANGES.
TAI'S GOING TO BE HARD TO BEAT,
AND AUBRY, SHE'S GOING TO BE
HARD TO BEAT.
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.
I HAVE NO ALLEGIANCE TO NO ONE
RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M A BETTER
PERSON TO STAND IN THE FINAL
THREE THAN ONE OF THEM.
NOW IS THE TIME TO START
SCHEMING, PLAYING FOR YOURSELF
AND PLAYING FOR THE END.
 JASON KIND OF HIT ME AND
CYDNEY REAL HARD.
BE SMART TO GO HIM, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO PUT DOUBT AT ALL IN MY
ALLIANCE, THAT'S WHY I VOTED
JULIA, BECAUSE THERE IS NO
BETTER WAY TO SHOW MY LOYALTY
THAN TO VOTE OUT MY BIGGEST ALLY
IN THIS GAME.
 THE THREE OF US, WE STICK
TOGETHER.
 WE'RE GOING TO STICK
TOGETHER.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT WE STICK
TOGETHER.
I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.
OKAY.
WE'LL USE THAT NEXT TIME, AND WE
HAVE FOUR.
 ALL OF A SUDDEN TAI REVEALED
HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE, WHICH IS AN
EXTRA VOTE, AND A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 AND THEN THE FOLLOWING ONE,
I'LL USE MY IDOL, WE'RE SAFE.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WE'RE STAYING UNTIL FOUR, AT
LEAST FOUR.
 IT'S A LITTLE SCARY.
TAI HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS
OF CONTROL, AND I GOT THE KEEP
ON TAI'S SIDE.
 THEY DON'T KNOW THE EXTRA
VOTE.
ONLY US THREE HERE KNOW I HAVE
AN EXTRA VOTE.
 RIGHT NOW MY ALLIANCE IS
AUBRY AND JOE.
WE ARE TIGHT GROUP OF THREE
ALREADY.
AND CYDNEY IS NUMBER FOUR, AND
THAT LEAVES MICHELE AND JASON.
WE STAY TRUE TO EACH OTHER, NO
ONE ELSE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT
IT.
 YEP.
 SO THE NEXT VOTE WILL BE
EITHER JASON, OR HE MIGHT BE A
LESSER THREAT THAN MICHELE.
MICHELE IS A LITTLE MORE ROUNDED
PLAYER.
SO I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE FOR ONE
OF THEM.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 YOU GUYS COME HERE.
LOOK AT THIS CRAZY THING.
 WHAT IS IT?
 THAT IS A BIG GRUB.
 WE MIGHT HAVE TO EAT ONE OF
THESE IN A CHALLENGE.
 TAI, WOULD YOU EAT IT?
 NO.
 THAT'S A GRUB.
 I STARTED DIGGING.
I SAW THIS GRUB.
IT'S FAT.
IT'S KIND OF NASTY.
I SAY, OH, MAYBE MOXIE WILL LIKE
IT.
MOCK, MOCK.
 OH, YEAH, HE WANTED IT, SURE
DID.
 OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THE CHICKEN.
WOW, THAT'S BRUTAL.
 SWALLOWED THE WHOLE THING, IN
ONE BITE.
HOLY MACKEREL.
HE'S LIKE, THAT'S MINE, NOBODY'S
EATING IT.
 HE ATE THAT THING WHOLE.
 I GAVE UP HOPE ON EATING THAT
CHICKEN DAYS AGO.
EVERYONE LOVES THAT STUPID
CHICKEN.
DAY 39 RIGHT NOW...
 GETTING A LITTLE COCKY.
SOME FOWL PLAY.
 I'M DEFINITELY BETWEEN A ROCK
AND HARD PLACE RIGHT NOW.
PRETTY FRUSTRATED.
I'M NOT REALLY ALLOWED TO PLAY
THE GAME BECAUSE NO ONE WILL
STRATEGIZE WITH ME.
THEY ARE SET IN THEIR WAYS, AND
EVERYTHING LANDS ON DEAF EARS.
 I SEE THAT.
 WE'RE WASTING THE CONCEPT OF
THE GAME AT THIS POINT.
NO ONE IS PLAYING THE GAME
ANYMORE.
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING,
AND EVERYONE'S DONE PLAYING AND
ACCEPTED THEIR POSITION WHERE
THEY'RE AT.
IT'S FRUSTRATING.
IT PISSES ME OFF.
 I DON'T THINK JASON HAS ANY
RESPECT FOR MUCH THAT DOESN'T GO
HIS WAY.
 AND THEN I'M SITTING HERE ON
THE OUTSIDE GOING, I STILL WANT
TO PLAY.
I STILL THINK I CAN HELP SOMEONE
MAKE A CRAZY MOVE, AND
EVERYONE'S LIKE, UH, I DON'T
REALLY FEEL LIKE IT.
 WHEN IT DOESN'T GO HIS WAY,
HE'S VULGAR AND JUST TRIES TO
BULLDOZE YOU, BUT I THINK PEOPLE
SEE THROUGH THAT.
 AND IF I'M GOING TO GET
THROWN OUT ON THE CURB AND BE
FORCED TO WATCH AND NOT HAVE A
CHOICE, WELL, I'M NOT HELPING
YOU.
AT THIS POINT I HAD ONE CARD TO
PLAY.
I JUST LAY AROUND AND EAT THEIR
FOOD.
I DON'T HELP THEM WITH FIREWOOD.
I DON'T HELP THEM WITH ANYTHING.
WHY?
WHY HELP THE HAND THAT'S TRYING
TO KILL ME?
 IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 HE'S NOT WINNING ANY VOTES.
LET'S JUST KEEP HIM AROUND.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO
SAY.
 WE'LL JUST END IT THERE.
 Jeff: COME IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS OF THREE.
ON MY GO, ONE AT A TIME, YOU'LL
RACE THROUGH A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES OUT TO A FLOATING
MAZE.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE PLAYERS
THERE, YOU'LL THEN WORK TOGETHER
TO MANEUVER THREE BALLS THROUGH
THE MAZE.
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: TODAY'S REWARD IS
PRETTY POWERFUL.
YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO A PLACE
CALLED THE WILDLIFE ALLIANCE, AN
ORGANIZATION HERE IN CAMBODIA
THAT RESCUES ANIMALS FROM
POACHERS AND ILLEGAL TRADERS AND
BRINGS THEM TO THE SANCTUARY TO
LIVE A BETTER LIFE.
 WOW.
 THAT'S AWESOME.
 Jeff: YOU'LL GET A CHANCE
TO VISIT THE FACILITY AND
INTERACT WITH THE ANIMALS.
YOU'LL ALSO ENJOY AN AFTERNOON
PICNIC.
WORTH PLAYING FOR?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: I KNOW IT IS.
WE'RE GOING TO DRAW TEAMS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
IT IS JOE, AUBRY AND CYDNEY
TAKING ON TAI, MICHELE AND
JASON.
FOR REWARD, HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
JASON GOING IN FIRST.
JOE GOING IN FIRST.
JASON QUICKLY HOPPING THROUGH
THESE OBSTACLES.
LEAVING JOE BACK AT THE FIRST
PLATFORM.
GOT TO GET ALL THE WAY TO THE
FLOATING PLATFORM BEFORE THE
NEXT PERSON CAN GO.
 LET'S GO, JOE.
 Jeff: JOE STILL WORKING FOR
YELLOW.
TAKING HIM A LONG TIME TO GET
THERE, BUT HE'S GETTING THERE.
GO, BLUE!
MICHELE NOW IN THE WATER FOR
BLUE.
JOE STILL WORKING FOR YELLOW.
MICHELE NOW AT THE OBSTACLE FOR
BLUE.
JOE PULLING HIMSELF UP.
THAT BODY TIRED, BUT HE IS NOT
GIVING UP.
MICHELE IS THERE NOW.
GO, BLUE!
TAI NOW IN THE WATER FOR BLUE.
JOE IS CRAWLING TO HIS MATT.
GO, YELLOW!
CYDNEY NOW IN THE WATER FOR
YELLOW.
CYDNEY HAS TO MAKE UP SOME TIME
NOW.
BLUE WITH A BIG LEAD.
 THAT'S IT, CYDNEY.
 Jeff: TAI NOW GOING TO GRAB
FIRST BALL FOR THE BLUE TEAM.
GO, AUBRY.
TAI HAS THE FIRST BALL FOR BLUE.
AUBRY IN THE WATER FOR YELLOW.
 READY?
 Jeff: BLUE HAS THEIR FIRST
BALL.
NOW YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO
MANEUVER THAT BALL THROUGH THE
MAZE.
AUBRY GETTING THE FIRST BALL FOR
YELLOW NOW.
GO THIS WAY.
BLUE WITH A BIG HEAD START.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TEAMWORK.
 PUT IT IN, PUT IT IN.
START WALKING THAT WAY.
 Jeff: YELLOW HAS THEIR
FIRST BALL.
THEY CAN START WORKING.
TAI, MICHELE, JASON, A LOT OF
COMMUNICATION, FIGURING OUT
WHERE THAT BALANCE POINT IS.
WHERE DOES THIS MAZE SHIFT?
AUBRY, CYDNEY, JOE RIGHT BACK IN
THIS.
JASON, TAI AND MICHELE MAKING
SOME PROGRESS.
THEY'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE
MAZE NOW.
GREAT LEADERSHIP BY JASON.
IT'S ONE THING TO JUST RUN
AROUND AND GET THE BALL THE
MOVE.
YOU NEED TO CONTROL IT TO GO
THROUGH THE ENTRY POINTS.
 A LITTLE BIT MORE.
 Jeff: NICE WORK BY BLUE.
VERY CLOSE TO THAT INNER CIRCLE
WITH THEIR FIRST BALL.
JOE, AUBRY, CYDNEY NOT MAKING
MUCH PROGRESS AT ALL.
 WE HAVE TO GET OVER HERE.
IT'S GOT TO BE AGAINST HERE,
GIRLS.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
 Jeff: YOU GOT TO GET IT TO
DROP IN A POCKET.
 OKAY, NOW.
DROP IT.
 Jeff: BLUE HAS THEIR FIRST.
BLUE WORKING ON THEIR SECOND
BALL.
THEY LEAD 1-0.
JASON UNTYING THE SECOND BALL
FOR BLUE.
JOE, AUBRY AND CYDNEY ARE IN THE
SAME SPOT.
JASON HAS THE SECOND BALL.
HE'S BACK.
 COME ON, COME ON!
 Jeff: CYDNEY, AUBRY, JOE
MAKING SOME PROGRESS NOW.
JASON, MICHELE AND TAI NOW HAVE
THE HANG OF IT.
THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER REALLY
WELL.
BIG REWARD ON THE LINE.
 COME ON, BABY, COME ON, BABY,
COME ON, BABY!
 Jeff: JASON VERY CONFIDENT,
FULLY IN CONTROL.
MICHELE, JASON AND TAI GETTING
VERY CLOSE TO THAT SECOND BALL
IN THE INNER CIRCLE.
MAKING THEIR MOVE.
WILL IT WORK?
YES, THEY'RE IN THE INNER CIRCLE
AND IT'S IN.
THAT'S TWO FOR BLUE.
JASON HEADING OUT FOR THE THIRD
AND FINAL BALL FOR BLUE.
 MOVE TO ME, MOVE TO ME, BABY.
MOVE TO ME.
 Jeff: JOE, AUBRY AND CYDNEY
FINALLY HAVE THEIR FIRST BALL IN
THAT INNER CIRCLE.
GOT TO GET IT IN A POCKET.
YELLOW HEADING OUT FOR THEIR
SECOND BALL.
BLUE WORKING ON THE THIRD AND
FINAL BALL AS AUBRY UNTIES THEIR
SECOND.
 GO LEFT, GO LEFT.
 Jeff: GO, YELLOW, WORKING
ON THEIR SECOND BALL.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE
FAST AND HOPE THEY GET LUCKY.
BECAUSE TAI, MICHELE AND JASON
HAVE FIGURED THIS CHALLENGE OUT.
THEY'RE NOW NEAR THAT INNER
CIRCLE.
JASON TRYING TO WILL IT IN.
CAN THEY GET IT IN THAT THIRD
POCKET FOR THE WIN?
 HOLD ON.
 YES!
 Jeff: IT'S IN!
TAI, MICHELE, JASON WIN REWARD.
A VISIT TO THE WILDLIFE ALLIANCE
AND AN AFTERNOON PICNIC.
ALL RIGHT.
MICHELE, TAI, JASON, NICE JOB.
COME ON IN, GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.
JOE, AUBRY, CYDNEY, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.
COME ON IN, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE
GOING ON THAT REWARD.
I LOVE ANIMALS, BUT I'M JUST
WORRIED.
I JUST WORRY TOO MUCH WHILE I'M
GONE THE TEAM GOING TO FALL
APART BACK AT CAMP.
 NICE TRY.
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
LEFT.
 REMEMBER?
 I'M HOPING THERE'S AN EMBER.
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE.
IT WAS AUBRY, MYSELF AND CYDNEY.
WE NEED WOOD.
 YOU WANT US TO GET THE
PROTEIN?
OR THE WOOD?
 WELL, LET'S GET THE WOOD
FIRST AND GET A NICE FIRE, AND
THEN WE CAN GO OFF AND LEAVE IT.
I PERFORM LIKE A SIX-MONTH-OLD,
SO I'M EMBARRASSED BY IT, BUT,
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE HAVE TO GET MORE WOOD,
DARLING.
YOU GOT TO MOVE.
 ONE MORE BITE AND I'LL GET
UP.
 I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO
GET A MEAL, A.K.A. FIVE PIECES
OF COCONUT DOWN MY THROAT, AND
APPARENTLY I SAT DOWN TOO LONG
AND THEN I HAVE TO GET UP OFF MY
BUTT AND FIND FIREWOOD.
I WAS LIKE, OH, NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR TROUBLE,
IS HOW TIRED YOU ARE, KEEP THAT
TO YOURSELF.
I'M TRYING TO EFFECT.
I AIN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL
WITH THAT.
I DON'T DO ORDERS WELL.
IT'S BEEN PROVEN THIS WHOLE
ENTIRE GAME.
THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE
BRONZE SIDE.
THIS SHOULD KEEP HIM GOOD.
I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THE
CONCEPT YOU DON'T NEED LARGE
FLAMES TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
WE DON'T NEED NO MORE HEAT,
BABY.
 I'M TRYING TO HELP.
 NO.
AROUND THIS SIDE OF THE FIRE.
 AROUND THIS SIDE?
 NO, NO, I WANT YOU TO STUFF
THAT UNDERNEATH WHEN I PICK THIS
UP?
 STUFF WHAT?
 THIS.
RIGHT HERE UNDERNEATH.
 SORRY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M
CLEAR.
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR ALL OF
US.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JOE'S PROBLEM
IS.
HE WANTS TO BURN THE DAMN PLACE
DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD, TOO, BECAUSE CYDNEY
IS NOT GOING TO BE BOSSED AROUND
AND TOLD WHAT TO DO, AND THE
LAST THING I NEED IS CYDNEY KIND
OF BLOWING UP THE GAME, BECAUSE
THEN WE'RE SCREWED.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
WE GOT A SPREAD.
OH, MY GOD.
 LOOK AT THIS.
 ME, JASON AND TAI WENT TO THE
WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, AND WE HAD
THIS WONDERFUL PICNIC SET UP.
I WAS IN HEAVEN.
 I'M HERE.
I'M STARVING.
GOOD JOB.
TO US, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
 TEAMWORK.
 IT'S AN ELEPHANT.
 IT'S COMING OUR WAY.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HUGE.
 WE WERE AT THIS BEAUTIFUL
HUT.
WE WERE HAVING SUCH A GREAT
TIME.
WE SAW AN ELEPHANT WALK UP.
 OH, MY GOD.
HI.
HI, LUCKY.
 NICK, THE DIRECTOR OF THE
WILDLIFE ALLIANCE, HE BROUGHT
THE ELEPHANT IN, LUCKY.
SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD AND STILL WAS
WONDERFUL.
 HOW DID YOU GUYS END UP WITH
HER?
 SHE WAS FOUND ALONE IN THE
FOREST IN THE SOUTHWEST OF THE
COUNTRY WANDERING ALONE WITHOUT
HER MOTHER.
 WOW.
 ALL THE ANIMALS HERE WERE
RESCUED FROM THE ILLEGAL
WILDLIFE TRADE.
 DO YOU WANT THIS?
NO?
YOU WANT ME?
YOU WANT ME?
 LUCKY, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
MY DAUGHTER IS CRAZY OVER
ANIMALS.
SHE'S NOT GOING THE BELIEVE
THIS.
MY DAUGHTER, WITH HER HAVING
AUTISM, FOR WHATEVER REASON,
ANIMALS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG
PART OF HER LIFE, WHERE YOU CAN
TELL IT GIVES HER COMFORT.
IT'S THAT SENSE OF SOFTNESS AND
STIMULI AND AWARENESS SHE NEEDS.
IT WAS PRETTY COOL TO KNOW I WAS
DOING SOMETHING MY LITTLE BABY
WOULD LOVE SO MUCH.
YOU'VE MADE MY TIME HERE, LUCKY.
IT'S GOING TO BE BLOWN AWAY THAT
DAD'S HANGING OUT WITH ANIMALS.
LIKE WHOSE DAD DOES THAT?
QUICK, QUICK.
 BE QUIET AND CALM.
BE QUIET AND CALM.
JUST SIT DOWN.
DON'T BE THREATENING.
 MONKEY, MONKEY.
 IT'S FITTING THAT JASON WAS
THERE.
JASON HAS A DAUGHTER WHO HAS
AUTISM.
AND HIS DAUGHTER SEEING THE
MONKEY HANG OUT WITH HIM, HE WAS
ABLE TO TOUCH THE ELEPHANT.
 GIVE ME A LITTLE MONKEY LOVE.
 I'M DEFINITELY WARMING UP TO
HIM A LOT MORE.
 HEY.
I JUST WANT A MONKEY HUG.
 EVEN THOUGH JASON IS VERY
PERSUASIVE AT TRIBAL, I TRY NOT
TO MAKE ANY ENEMIES WITH THE
JURY, SO RIGHT NOW I THINK
MICHELE SHOULD GO NEXT.
 I THINK JASON WANTS TO SEEM A
LITTLE BIT SOFTER THAN HE IS.
I WANT TO THINK THAT HE'S
ENJOYING THE ANIMALS AND DOING
IT FOR HIS KIDS, BUT WHEN THE
MACHETE AND THE AX SITUATION
HAPPENED, I SAW THAT EVIL SIDE
COME OUT.
FEISTY.
SO IF JASON DOESN'T WIN
IMMUNITY, BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR
ME WOULD BE GET JASON OUT NEXT.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
SO WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, MICHELE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME AT
ALL.
 I MADE HEADWAY.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO HOLD ON THE A ROPE THAT
BALANCES A POSSIBLY TABLE.
ON MY GO, YOU'RE GOING THE RACE
OUT AND COLLECT WOODEN BLOCKS,
BRINGING THEM BACK ONE AT A
TIME, STACKING THEM ONE ON TOP
OF ANOTHER, SPELLING IMMUNITY.
AT ANY POINT IF THE TABLE
WOBBLES, THE STACK FALLS, YOU
HAVE TO START OVER.
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN
FIVE SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS, AFTER 32 DAYS, SOMEBODY
BE VOTED OUT AND BILL BECOME THE
SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPORTS AND GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY AND A
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
FIVE, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE A
LEARNING CURVE TO THIS
CHALLENGE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE,
PATIENCE, AND WHEN YOU NEED IT,
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SPEED.
YOU'RE SPELLING THE WORD
"IMMUNITY," BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
IT ONE BLOCK AT A TIME WHILE
BALANCING THOSE BLOCKS ON A VERY
WOBBLY TABLE.
JOE BACK FOR HIS SECOND BLOCK.
JOE, 71, STILL IN THIS GAME, OUT
TO THE EARLY LEAD IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
18 PEOPLE STARTED THIS GAME.
SIX ARE LEFT.
FIVE WILL LIVE TO SEE TOMORROW.
JOE PLACES HIS SECOND BLOCK.
JOE PLAYING AGGRESSIVELY.
MICHELE PLACES HER SECOND BLOCK.
TAI PLACES HIS SECOND.
HE STARTS HEADING BACK.
AUBRY PLACES HER SECOND.
JASON PLACES HIS SECOND.
CYDNEY IN DEAD LAST RIGHT NOW.
LITERALLY MOVING LIKE SHE CAN'T
WALK.
JOE PLACES HIS THIRD BLOCK.
MICHELE IN SECOND.
TAI WITH HIS THIRD BLOCK.
JASON PLACES HIS THIRD.
AUBRY PLACES HER THIRD BLOCK.
JOE HAS HIS FOURTH BLOCK.
EVEN REACHING FOR THE BLOCK IS
DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE
TO MAINTAIN BALANCE.
JOE BACK WITH THAT FOURTH BLOCK.
JOE IS HALF-WAY THROUGH THIS
CHALLENGE.
THEN MICHELE, THEN TAI.
EVERYBODY ELSE FIGHTING TO GET
BACK IN IT.
CYDNEY STILL IN DEAD LAST
HEADING BACK WITH HER THIRD
COMPLETELY OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE
RIGHT NOW.
HERE'S JOE WITH HIS FIFTH.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
THE HIGHER YOUR STACK GETS, THE
MORE CAREFUL YOU HAVE TO BE.
TAI NEARLY DROPS.
NICE SAVE.
JASON'S BEEN ON THE BOTTOM.
HE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IMMUNITY
TONIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONE BLOCK AT A
TIME, ONE SLIP, THAT STACK
FALLS.
JOE DUMPS EVERYTHING AFTER
LEADING THE ENTIRE CHALLENGE.
PICK 'EM ALL UP, BRING 'EM BACK,
START AGAIN.
IT IS NOW MICHELE IN THE LEAD.
TAI RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
MICHELE DROPS.
IT IS NOW TAI.
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY THIS
CHALLENGE CAN CHANGE.
AUBRY DROPS.
IT'S CONTAGIOUS.
IT IS NOW TAI IN THE LEAD, JASON
ON HIS TAIL.
CYDNEY STILL OUT OF IT.
AND JUST LIKE THAT TAI DROPS.
IT IS NOW JASON IN THE LEAD.
IT IS A BRAND-NEW CHALLENGE, AND
NOW CYDNEY'S IN SECOND PLACE.
 OH, MAN, I GOT THE WRONG
WORD.
I GOT AN "I."
 Jeff: JOE HAS THE WRONG
LETTER.
NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO STACK
THESE AND BALANCE THEM, YOU HAVE
TO REMEMBER HOW THE SPELL
"IMMUNITY."
NOW JASON WITH A NICE LEAD OVER
CYDNEY HEADING BACK WITH HIS
SIXTH.
JASON DUMPS.
IT IS NOW CYDNEY IN THE LEAD.
UNBELIEVABLE TURNAROUND.
CYDNEY HAS NOT BEEN IN THIS
CHALLENGE AT ALL, AND SHE'S NOW
IN FIRST PLACE.
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT CYDNEY'S
APPROACH, BUT SHE HAS NOT
DROPPED THIS ENTIRE CHALLENGE.
EVERYBODY CHASING CYDNEY.
DEAD LAST THE ENTIRE CHALLENGE.
NOW COULD WIN IT.
SLOW AND STEADY MIGHT BE THE
ANSWER.
 DAMN.
 Jeff: JOE DID IT AGAIN.
IT'S CYDNEY NOW INCREASING HER
LEAD.
CYDNEY WITH FIVE.
AUBRY WITH THREE.
MICHELE WITH THREE.
TAI WITH THREE.
JASON WITH TWO.
THE GOOD NEWS IS CYDNEY
CONTINUES TO GO AT A VERY SLOW
PACE, WHICH MEANS SHE CAN BE
CAUGHT.
MICHELE HEADING BACK, LOOKING
FOR THAT FOURTH.
AUBRY WITH HER FIFTH BLOCK.
JASON PLACES HIS THIRD.
TRYING TO GET BACK IN THIS.
GOING TO BE MOVING MORE QUICKLY.
TAI HAS HIS FIFTH BLOCK.
HE'S BACK IN IT.
 Jeff: WHAT DID YOU BRING
BACK?
 JOE BRINGS BACK THE WRONG
LETTER.
 Jeff: IT'S FUNNY UNTIL YOU
GET TO TRIBAL.
AUBRY COMING BACK WITH HER
SIXTH.
THIS COULD PUT HER IN THE LEAD.
MICHELE HAS HER FIFTH.
MICHELE DROPS AND LOSES
EVERYTHING.
TAI DROPS.
TAI'S OUT OF IT.
AUBRY DROPS.
THE ONLY CHALLENGER TO CYDNEY
JUST DROPPED.
IT IS NOW CYDNEY WITH HER SIXTH
BLOCK.
THIS IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO
JASON AND CYDNEY.
CAN JASON PICK UP THE PACE
ENOUGH TO GET BACK IN THIS.
JASON COMING BACK WITH HIS SIXTH
BLOCK.
CYDNEY TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM
CERTAINTY TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
JASON PLACES HIS SIXTH BLOCK.
HE'S ONLY GOT TWO LEFT.
CYDNEY NOW PICKING UP THE PACE A
LITTLE BIT.
SHE CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE FROM
JASON.
HERE'S CYDNEY WITH HER SEVENTH
BLOCK.
SHE HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT.
JASON HEADING OUT WITH HIS
SEVENTH WHILE CYDNEY IS HEADING
BACK, GOING VERY SLOWLY BACK FOR
EIGHT.
JASON ON HER TAIL.
JASON PLACES HIS SEVENTH.
JASON HAS ALMOST CAUGHT CYDNEY.
CYDNEY GOING VERY SLOW.
JASON EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW
BETWEEN CYDNEY AND JASON.
CYDNEY REACHING FOR THAT EIGHTH
BLOCK.
CAN'T FIND IT.
CAN'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR
TABLE.
JASON HAS HIS EIGHTH BLOCK.
JASON NOW IN THE LEAD.
ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER LEAD CHANGE.
IT IS JASON AND CYDNEY, BOTH
COMING BACK WITH THEIR EIGHTH
AND FINAL BLOCK.
CYDNEY TRYING TO PICK UP SOME
PACE.
JASON HAS HIS EIGHTH BLOCK
PLACED.
HE'S HEADING BACK.
CYDNEY HAS HER EIGHTH BLOCK
PLACED.
SHE'S HEADING BACK.
IT IS GOING TO BE A RACE TO GET
BACK TO THE START WITHOUT
DUMPING.
THIS COULD BE IT RIGHT HERE.
JASON STILL WITH A ONE FOOT --
AND JASON DUMPS.
CYDNEY NOW ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY
FROM WINNING IMMUNITY.
CYDNEY HAS ONE FOOT UP THERE.
SHE'S GOT TWO.
CYDNEY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
FIVE.
WOW.
CYDNEY, COME ON OVER.
NICELY DONE.
YOU ARE SAFE.
YOU WILL NOT BE VOTED OUT.
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FIVE.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND
BECOME THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
NICE JOB.
 THAT WAS MY FAVORITE
CHALLENGE SO FAR.
 ME, TOO.
 YOU AGAINST THE BLOCKS.
 UH-HUH.
FOR TONIGHT'S TRIBAL, I DECIDED
MICHELE IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN
JASON.
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO CONVINCE
THE GROUP TO VOTE FOR MICHELE.
LET'S TALK.
I THINK IT'S MICHELE.
 I'D RATHER GET RID OF JASON.
 I THINK MICHELE.
 UNFORTUNATELY MICHELE JOINED
US FOUR, AND THE GROUP HASN'T
COME TO A DECISION YET, BUT MOST
LIKELY IT'S GOING TO BE MICHELE.
 JASON?
 IT SEEMS PRETTY OBVIOUS.
 IT'S VERY OBVIOUS.
 I MEAN, AT FIRST...
 MICHELE THINKS JASON'S THE
NEXT ONE TO GO, BUT FOR
TONIGHT'S VOTE, I'M GOING TO USE
MY EXTRA VOTE AND PUT THAT FOR
MICHELE.
SO MAYBE WE HAVE FOUR OR FIVE
NUMBERS URGE AND WE SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
 I THINK SHE'S A BIGGER
THREAT.
 I DO, TOO.
 JASON, WE'RE GOING TO VOTE
FOR MICHELE.
 MICHELE?
 I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR
MICHELE.
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED, BUT I'LL
TALK TO THEM.
 TAI COMES UP TO ME AND GOES,
VOTE MICHELE.
BUT I CAN'T TRUST TAI.
HE'S ALREADY TURNED ON ME ONCE.
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO VOTE FOR
JOE, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.
PRETTY MUCH PLAYING IT BY EAR AT
THIS POINT.
 ME, TOO.
I'M ON THE SAME PAGE WITH YOU
BECAUSE TAI HAS HIS OWN AGENDA
ON WHY HE WANTS TO VOTE MICHELE.
JASON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VOTED
OFF A LONG TIME AGO, SO
HOPEFULLY I CAN CONVINCE PEOPLE
WHY JASON NEEDS TO GO BEFORE
MICHELE.
 I'LL DO WHATEVER EVERYBODY
WANTS.
I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT CITY
HALL.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
 TAI IS TRYING TO DICTATE WHAT
GOES ON, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
INTIMIDATE PEOPLE INTO GOING
WITH YOUR DECISION, LIKE JOE
FEELS INTIMIDATED.
THAT LEAVES A LITTLE SUSPICION
IN MY EYES.
IT'S NOT SITTING TOO RIGHT WITH
ME.
 TAI IS ANTI-MICHELE.
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ALL OF US
ANTI-YOU RIGHT NOW.
 SO AUBRY IS VOTING FOR ME
NOW?
 HE'S TRYING TO MAKE US DO IT.
 LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT TAI
HAS MY HEAD ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK AND IS PUTTING IT IN THEIR
HEADS THAT HE WANTS ME OUT.
 I'M GOING TO DO MY DAMNEDEST
NO GET THEM OFF YOUR BACK, BUT I
WANT YOU TO KNOW I GOT YOUR BACK
AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY CAN.
 BUT I WAS ON A TYING TIME
LIMIT TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO I
HAVEN'T TALKED TO, SO TONIGHT
FOR ME AT TRIBAL, I'M GOING TO
DO SOME DAMAGE CONTROL AND HOPE
THAT JASON CAN GO AND I CAN LAST
ANOTHER DAY IN THIS GAME.
 I HAVE AN ISSUE.
SOMEBODY'S DICTATING WHAT WE'RE
DOING.
AND TAI IS PUSHING IT SO HARD.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THAT'S THE SAME THING I'VE
ALREADY BEEN THROUGH.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DICTATE WHO
I VOTE FOR.
 TAI KIND OF DECIDED THAT WE
WERE GETTING RID OF MICHELE, AND
I AGREE WITH THAT DECISION.
MICHELE HAS PISSED NOBODY OFF
AND EVERYONE GETS ALONG WITH
MICHELE, BUT IT WASN'T THE MOST
DEMOCRATIC THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
AND CYDNEY THINKS IT'S THE WRONG
DECISION, AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO
BE TOLD WHAT TO DO.
 FOR ME PERSONALLY, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO DICTATE.
 BUT THEN TAI IS A PART OF MY
CORE ALLIANCE, SO IT'S A TOUGH
SPOT TO BE IN.
I'M IN A WEIRD POSITION.
I HOPE YOU RESPECT THAT I HAVE A
DIFFERENT THOUGHT ON THIS ONE.
 WELL, IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT,
WOULD YOU VOTE WITH ME OR WITH
HIM?
 I'M SO MENTALLY EXHAUSTED
TODAY.
THIS IS A ROUGH ONE.
IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE.
 I HAVE NO CLUE WHO I'M VOTING
FOR TONIGHT.
IT'S GOING TO BE A GAME-TIME
DECISION.
I THINK TRIBAL WILL BE ALIVE,
AND I THINK I MIGHT BE SOMEONE
WAKING IT UP.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NEAL, NICK, DEBBIE, SCOT, AND
JULIA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S
CHALLENGE.
DON'T RECALL EVER SEEING THAT
MANY LEAD CHANGES IN ONE
CHALLENGE EVER.
JASON, DOES THAT SORT OF SUM UP
WHERE THIS GAME IS, THAT IT IS
REALLY JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE
AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S JUST AN UNPREDICTABLE,
EVERY TIME YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
IT, GONE.
EVERY SINGLE PERSON HERE WANTS
IT, BUT THE BLOCKS ONLY STAYED
FOR HER.
 Jeff: CYDNEY WORK THAT
AROUND YOUR NECK, IN ADDITION TO
BEING SAFE, THE IMMUNITY CAN
GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
SWAY.
DID YOU FEEL ANY OF THAT TODAY?
 WELL, FOR ME, EVERYBODY HAS
TO PLAY THEIR OWN GAME.
SOME PEOPLE FELT A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMFORTABLE THAN OTHERS,
I'LL SAY, AND THEY WANTED TO
DICTATE WITH THINGS SHOULD GO
AND WHAT DECISIONS SHOULD BE
MADE FOR YOU.
 I CAN CLARIFY WHO IT WAS.
I THINK WE ALL KNOW IT'S TAI.
TAI HAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT HE HAS TWO IMMUNITY IDOLS
OR THAT HE HAS THE SUPER IDOL.
 I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
WHETHER IT'S AN IDOL OR NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHETHER YOU WANT TO BELIEVE ME
OR NOT, IT'S UP TO YOU.
BUT I THINK OUR ALLIANCE GOT
TOGETHER.
EVERYBODY HAS A VOICE, EVERYBODY
HAS AN OPINION.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, WHY THE BIG
REACTION?
 IT'S TAI'S WAY OR THE
HIGHWAY.
THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMED LIKE TO ME
TODAY.
WE WERE BRINGING UP DIFFERENT
POINTS, AND THEY WEREN'T BEING
HEARD.
 WELL, I WANTED TO HAVE SOME
MOMENT WITH CYDNEY ALONE AND
TALK TO HER, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE
TIME.
 Jeff: AUBRY, A LOT OF
FACIAL REACTION FROM YOU.
 I THOUGHT HE HAD TIME WITH
CYDNEY THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO
TALK THROUGH THINGS WITH CYDNEY.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE CONFUSED AS
TO WHY HE NEEDED MORE TIME?
 I GUESS SO A LITTLE BIT.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL WORKED OUT
AS A GROUP.
 WELL, I THINK IT SAYS A LOT
THAT SINCE WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE
TOGETHER WE ALL SAID WHO IT WAS
GOING TO BE TONIGHT.
NOW YOU NEED PRIVATE ALONE
CONVERSATIONS.
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME, BUT
OKAY.
 WELL, JEFF, THERE'S A BIG
GROUP, THERE'S A SMALLER GROUP
WITHIN THE BIG GROUP.
 SO WHAT TAI'S TRYING TO SAY
IS THERE IS A PECKING ORDER, AND
I'M ON THE BOTTOM, SO NOW I
CAN'T BE INCLUDED BECAUSE
THERE'S A SMALLER GROUP, AND HE
THINKS HE'S SITTING SO PRETTY TO
DICTATE BECAUSE HE HAS TWO
IDOLS.
 WELL, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE
DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT NEEDS TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT...
 I THOUGHT WE HAD THE SAME
IDEA WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN
TONIGHT.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE SAME
PAGE.
 I THINK WE HAVE DIFFERENT
OPINIONS, BUT AT THE END, WE
HAVE CONSENSUS WHO NEEDS TO GO
HOME TONIGHT.
 Jeff: TAI, THIS IS DEEPER
THAN A DIFFERENT OPINION.
YOU SAID THERE IS A GROUP AND
THEN THERE'S A SMALLER GROUP.
ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW THAT MIGHT
MAKE MICHELE FEEL, THAT I MUST
NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH FOR THAT
LEVEL OF MEETING?
 YES, IF I WAS HER, THAT'S
EXACTLY HOW I'D READ IT.
 Jeff: SO MICHELE, YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU SIT IN THAT GROUP.
 I KNOW WHERE TAI THINKS I SIT
IN THAT GROUP, IF THAT'S WHERE
THE REST OF MY ALLIANCE THINKS I
SIT, THAT'S A CHANGE, BECAUSE
TAI HAS TURNED ON EVERY ALLIANCE
HE'S EVER HAD, AND I HAVE PROVEN
MY LOYALTY OVER AND OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
I MEAN, CRAZY IS DOING SOMETHING
REPEATEDLY AND EXPECTING
DIFFERENT RESULTS.
AND IF THEY WANT TO BE CRAZY,
THEN GO WITH TAI.
GET IT OVER.
 THE LAST VOTE WAS IN THE A
FLIP-FLOP.
 ONE VOTE YOU DIDN'T FLIP.
AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING...
 TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU END UP WITH THIS
ALLIANCE, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
KNOW, AND SOMEHOW AFTER THE
VOTE...
 I WAS MORE ORIGINAL IN THIS
ALLIANCE THAN YOU WERE.
 THAT WAS A BRAND-NEW ALLIANCE
WHEN WE FORMED.
AND ACTUALLY, WHY DO WE HAVE AN
EXTRA PERSON?
 Jeff: WOW.
SO MICHELE, NOT ONLY ARE YOU AT
THE BOTTOM, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
REALLY WANTED.
 I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE A
BUNCH OF MALARKEY TO ME, BUT
WHATEVER.
 Jeff: AUBRY, THERE IS A LOT
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN THE
MIDDLE OF JUST CHAOS RIGHT NOW?
 YEAH.
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE CYDNEY
AND MICHELE HAVE SOME MISTRUST
IN TAI.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALKING,
AND IF STUFF STARTS TO SWIRL, I
CAN'T CONTROL WHAT TAI SAYS, TAI
CAN OWN HIS OWN WORDS.
I HAVE A DIFFERENT STYLE OF PLAY
I WOULD SAY THAN TAI.
 Jeff: JASON?
 HOW YOU DOING, JEFF?
 Jeff: JASON, YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BOTTOM AND ON
THE OUTSIDE FOR A WHILE, AND YET
THE CONVERSATION IS NOT SWIRLING
AROUND YOU.
 THAT'S WHY I'M KEEPING QUIET.
 SO WHEN YOU HEAR MICHELE AND
TAI DUKING IT OUT, DOES THAT
EXCITE YOU?
 OF COURSE IT EXCITES ME.
YOU KNOW, WE GET HERE AND ALL
THESE FRACTURES IN THE CONCRETE
START HAPPENING.
IT MIGHT MEAN I GET ANOTHER TRIP
HERE.
IT ALSO MIGHT MEAN I STILL GO
HOME TONIGHT, AND I KNOW WHO IS
FOLLOWING ME NEXT TIME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JASON, YOU'RE UP.
 YOU GOT TO GO FIRST.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
 WAIT, JEFF.
I WANT THE USE MY ADVANTAGE.
 Jeff: WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT THE ADVANTAGE IS.
 MY ADVANTAGE, I CAN ADD
ANOTHER VOTE TO ANY TRIBAL.
 Jeff: SO TAI'S ADVANTAGE IS
AN EXTRA VOTE THAT COUNTS THE
SAME AS ANY OTHER VOTE.
TAI, GO CAST YOUR SECOND VOTE.
 NUMBER TWO.
YOU GOT TO GO HOME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE JASON.
MICHELE.
MICHELE.
JASON.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES MICHELE,
TWO VOTES JASON.
JOE.
ONE VOTE JOE.
JASON.
THAT'S THREE VOTES JASON, TWO
VOTES MICHELE, ONE VOTE JOE, ONE
VOTE LEFT.
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
JASON, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
JASON, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, IT APPEARS IN VOTING OUT
JASON, YOU GOT ONE OF THE ONE
PERSON STILL SWIMMING ALONE,
WHICH LEAVES FIVE OF YOU WITH
NOT ENOUGH ROOM IN THE RAFT FOR
EVERYBODY.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"... TAI'S PLAN THE
TAKE OUT MICHELE BACKFIRED.
 AUBRY PULLED A FAST ONE ON
ME.
 Jeff: BUT AN UNLIKELY
ALLIANCE COULD CHANGE
EVERYTHING.
 I HAVE AN IDOL...
 IF HE FEELS BETRAYED, HE
MIGHT COMPLETELY GO ANOTHER WAY.
 WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT
ME AND TAI WOULD WORK TOGETHER.
 I'VE BEEN WATCHING "SURVIVOR"
FOR 15 YEARS.
I STILL LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH AS
I DID DAY ONE.
I DIDN'T QUIT, DIDN'T GIVE UP,
EVEN BEING SENT OUT ON MY OWN, I
STILL TRIED TO GET IN THERE AND
FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.
I'M PROUD OF THE WAY I PLAYED.
I'M PROUD OF THE GAME I PLAYED.
AND I THINK MY FAMILY WILL BE,
TOO.
LOVE YOU, GIRLS.
