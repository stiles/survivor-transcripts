         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR", KAOH RONG HAS
PROVIDED SOME OF THE TOUGHEST
CONDITIONS EVER.
 THE HEAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE
TORS OF THIS GAME. MORE THAN CAN
TAKE.
 I'M PHYSICALLY VERY WEAK
RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: AT THE BEAUTY TRIBE,
THE WOMEN FOUND SAFETY IN EACH








OTHER.
 WE'RE PRETTY TIGHT.
 Jeff: BUT TAI FOUND AN IDOL
AND A FRIENDSHIP WITH CALEB.
 I WAS TOTALLY GOING IN FOR
THE KISS.
 Jeff: AT THE BRAWN TRIBE,
ALECIA STUMBLED ON A CLUE TO THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 IF I FIND THAT IDOL, THIS IS
MY GAME.
 Jeff: BUT HER LUCK RAN OUT
WHEN JASON GOT HIS HANDS ON THE
IDOL FIRST.








 I'M ON THE TOP, AND NOW I'M
BACK ON THE BOTTOM.
 Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, BRAWN FINALLY WON.
BRAWN TRIBE DOES IT, SENDING THE
BRAINS TRIBE TO TRIBAL COUNCIL!
AT CAMP, PETER AND LIZ WERE
CERTAIN THEY HAD CONTROL OF THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
 I'M SO CONFIDENT THIS WILL
WORK THE WAY WE WANT IT TO.
 HOW ABOUT THAT?
 Jeff: BUT DEBBIE WAS TIRED
OF TAKING ORDERS AN SPEARHEADED
A REVOLT AGAINST LIZ AND PETER.
 IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY WHEN WE
GET HOME, KIDS.
[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DEBBIE'S PLAN WORKED, SENDING
LIZ HOME.
LIZ, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING PETER ALL ALONE ON THE
BOTTOM.
15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 WELL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
 TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT
WENT DOWN EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED.
I GATHERED MY INTELLIGENCE.
I MADE OBSERVATIONS, THEN MADE
OBJECTIVES, KNEW HOW TO CARRY
THEM OUT.
I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO CALL
ME THE MASTERMIND.
IT CAME DOWN TO YOU AND HER, I
COULDN'T LET IT BE YOU.
 SHE TELLS ME THE DIAL BACK
AND JUST CHILL OUT.
 PETER'S POSITION IN THE TRIBE
HAS KNOCKED HIS EGO DOWN TEN
NOTCHES.
HE'S A TOTAL NARCISSIST, BUT HE
KNOWS HE'S STILL ON THE
PERIPHERY.
 I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED, THAT'S
THE THING.
I'M JUST SHOCKED.
 WE WANTED YOU HERE.
 THANKS FOR COMING OVER.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WAS A
COMPLETE SURPRISE.
I'M STILL... I HAVE KNOTS IN MY
STOMACHS.
WE'RE NOW THE PEABRAINS, NOT THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG TRIBE
ANYMORE.
I'M DEJECTED, BUT I'M HAPPY I'M
STILL HERE.
ONCE WE GET TO THE SWAP, I'M
GOING THE TAKE THEM OUT ONE BY
ONE.
 I NEED A BEER.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN.
 Jeff: BEAUTY TRIBE, BRAWN
TRIBE GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW BRAIN TRIBE.
LIZ VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 WOW.
 I DID NOT EXPECT THAT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL
RACE THROUGH A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES AND A WALL WHICH YOU
MUST DIG UNDER AND GET YOURSELF
THROUGH.
YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOU'RE WAY TO A
SANDY DITCH.
YOU HAVE TO DIG UP THREE BAGS OF
BALLS.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE BALL, YOU
WILL ROLL THOSE BALLS,
ATTEMPTING TO LAND THEM IN A
SERIES OF TARGETS.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST TRIBE THE
FINISH, A "SURVIVOR" KITCHEN
SET.
 NICE.
 Jeff: PLUS SPICES, COFFEE.
THIS WILL CHANGE THE WAY
EVERYTHING TASTES BACK AT CAMP.
SECOND TRIBE TO FINISH, NOT AS
EXTENSIVE, BUT EVEN SALT AND
PEPPER WILL MAKE COCONUTS TASTE
BETTER.
LAST TRIBE TO FINISH, NOTHING.
ALL RIGHT.
BEAUTY TRIBE, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA
MEMBERS.
SITTING TWO PEOPLE OUT.
KEEP IN MIND, YOU CANNOT SIT OUT
THE SAME PEOPLE IN BACK-TO-BACK
CHALLENGES.
WHOEVER SITS OUT THIS WILL RUN
IN THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
JULIA AND ANNA WILL SIT THIS ONE
OUT.
BRAIN TRIBE, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER, WHO YOU GOING TO SIT
OUT?
NEAL WILL SIT THIS ONE OUT.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
EVERYONE ELSE TAKE A SECOND TO
STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL GET IT ON.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
UNDER THAT FIRST OBSTACLE.
VERY HOT SAND.
YOU FORGET HOW QUICKLY THE SAND
HEATS UP.
OVER NEXT TWO IT'S BEAUTY AND
BRAWN OUT STRONG QUICKLY, THEN
BRAIN.
 LET'S GO, BRAIN!
 Jeff: LET'S GO.
START DIGGING.
 YOU GOT THIS, YOU GOT THIS,
YOU GOT THIS.
 Jeff: BRAIN CAN'T GO UNTIL
EVERYBODY IS OVER.
JOE PICKING IT UP.
THERE YOU GO, BRAIN.
GO!
 COME ON, BRAINS.
 Jeff: YOU GOT TO DIG
YOURSELF UNDER THAT LOG.
WOW, CYDNEY THROUGH QUICKLY FOR
THE BRAWN TRIBE.
THAT'S FASTEST ANYBODY'S EVER
GOTTEN UNDER A LOG.
HERE COMES DEBBIE FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE, LIKE A TURTLE BIRTHING AN
EGG.
HERE COMES TAI FOR THE BEAUTY
TRIBE.
ONCE YOU'RE THROUGH YOU CAN
START DIGGING ON THE OTHER SIDE.
HERE COMES AUBRY FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE.
 COME ON, GUYS.
 YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT!
 Jeff: THE BIGGEST GUY OUT
HERE IS THROUGH.
SCOT IS THROUGH.
JASON IS THROUGH.
BRAWN OUT TO THE EARLY LEAD.
GO!
YOU'RE NOW DIGGING UP BAGS.
BRAIN IS NOW THROUGH.
START DIGGING UP BAGS.
IT IS NOW BEAUTY IN LAST PLACE.
NOW NICK IS A BIG BODY TO GET
THROUGH THAT HOLE.
BEAUTY IS THROUGH.
GO, START DIGGING.
 KEEP GOING, BRAINS, KEEP
GOING.
 Jeff: YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THREE BAGS OF BALLS.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
ONCE YOU HAVE THEM, YOU CAN MOVE
ON.
SCOT HAS THE FIRST BAG FOR THE
BRAWN TRIBE.
 I GOT ONE BAG.
 Jeff: BEAUTY HAS THEIR
FIRST BAG.
IT IS BRAWN WITH ONE BAG, BEAUTY
WITH ONE BAG.
SCOT WITH A SECOND BAG FOR THE
BRAWN TRIBE.
BRAIN TRIBE HAS THEIR FIRST BAG.
IT IS NOW BRAWN WITH TWO, BRAIN
AND BEAUTY WITH ONE.
 I'M DYING HERE.
 DYING.
 Jeff: IT'S HOT JUST
STANDING HERE WATCHING YOU GUYS.
CERTAINLY NOT EASY NINE DAYS
INTO THE TOUGHEST GAME YOU WILL
EVER PLAY.
 OH, MY GOD.
OH.
OH.
 Jeff: WHO KNEW IT COULD BE
THIS DIFFICULT TO FIND THREE
LITTLE BAGS IN A PILE OF SAND.
ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION.
BRAWN HAS HAD TWO BAGS FOR A
LONG TIME.
CAN'T FIND THAT THIRD.
BRAINS WITH ONE.
BEAUTY WITH ONE.
DEBBIE HAS THE SECOND BAG FOR
THE BRAIN TRIBE.
 GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT.
 Jeff: BRAIN HAS THEIR THIRD
BAG.
OUT OF NOWHERE THEY CAN MOVE ON.
EMPTY THOSE BALLS.
HUGE LEAD FOR THE BRAIN TRIBE.
BOTH TRIBES DIGGING IN THE SAND
ARE EXHAUSTED.
 NICE, AUBRY.
 Jeff: AUBRY NOW FIRING
BALLS FOR THE BRAIN TRIBE.
YOU'RE LOOKING THE LAND ALL SIX
BALLS IN TARGET.
 YES!
 Jeff: AUBRY WITH THE FIRST
ONE FOR THE BRAIN TRIBE.
AUBRY WITH A SECOND FOR THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
 DIG.
DIG.
 Jeff: BRAIN TRIBE WITH
MASSIVE LEAD.
 COME ON, PETER.
 Jeff: PETER NOW TAKING OVER
FOR THE BRAIN TRIBE.
HE LANDS ONE.
THAT'S THREE FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE.
YOU CAN SEE THE EXHAUSTION.
 HANG IN THERE, KIDDO.
 YOU GOT IT, PETER.
YOU GOT IT.
YEAH, PETER.
YEAH, BABY, YEAH!
 Jeff: PETER WITH HIS
FOURTH.
 Jeff: BRAIN HAS FUR OF
THEIR SIX BALLS.
HERE COMES DEBBIE.
IT IS A BLOWOUT AT THIS POINT.
DEBBIE WITH FIFTH FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE.
ONE BALL LEFT FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE.
PETER NOW TAKING OVER FOR THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
ONE MORE.
CAN HE DO IT?
 LET'S GO, PETER.
BRING IT HOME.
 Jeff: PETER WITH THE SIXTH
AND FINAL FOR THE BRAIN TRIBE.
THE OTHER TWO TRIBES ARE NOT
EVEN CLOSE.
BRAIN TRIBE WITH MASSIVE REWARD.
NOW WE'RE DOWN TO SECOND.
BRAWN AND BEAUTY, WE HAVE BEEN
OUT HERE A LONG TIME DOING THIS
CHALLENGE.
 I'M STILL DIGGING.
 YEAH, BABY.
 Jeff: CALEB FOUND THE
SECOND BAG FOR BEAUTY.
 GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT
IT.
 Jeff: AND JUST LIKE THAT
NICK HAS THE THIRD BAG.
BEAUTY WITH ALL THREE BAGS.
THEY CAN STAR ROLLING.
 YOU OKAY?
 I'M ON FIRE FROM THE INSIDE
OUT.
 Jeff: HERE COMES CALEB.
BEAUTY WITH THEIR FIRST BALL.
 OH.
 DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL MEDIC?
 I'M GOING TO CALL.
 NO, DON'T DO IT.
 YOU'RE GOING TO GO TOO FAR
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE HEAT
STROKE.
 Jeff: BEAUTY WITH THEIR
SECOND BALL.
 JEFF.
I THINK SHE'S GETTING HEAT
EXHAUSTION.
SHE ONLY WEIGHS 98 POUNDS.
 Jeff: HOW YOU FEELING, DEB?
 I HAVE HEAT STROKE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
MEDICAL, MEDICAL, COME IN.
LET'S GO!
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: JUST STAY.
JUST HOLD TIGHT.
 OH, GOD.
 HOW YOU DOING?
 I'M OVERHEATING.
 JUST TAKE IT EASY.
 Jeff: WE HAVE THREE
DIFFERENT STORIES HAPPENING AT
ONCE.
BRAWN STILL DIGGING WHILE THE
BEAUTY TRIBE IS TRYING TO FINISH
ITS SECOND WHILE MEDICAL IS
ATTENDING TO DEBBIE.
JOE, GIVE ME AN UPDATE.
WHAT'S GOING ON.
 SHE'S QUITE HOT AT THE
MOMENT.
SHE'S SUFFERING FROM THE HEAT.
WE NEED TO WORK ON COOLING HER
DOWN.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE LITERALLY
POURING COLD WATER ON HER TO
COOL HER DOWN.
 WE JUST NEED THE MAKE SURE WE
CAN COOL HER DOWN.
 SO MUCH BETTER.
 Jeff: YOU FEELING ALL
RIGHT, DEBBIE?
 YES, SIR.
WHEN I GO THROUGH RANGER
TRAINING, WE'RE TAUGHT FIRST
AID.
BECAUSE OF MY TRAINING, I
ACTUALLY KNEW I WAS HEAT STROKE.
HEAT STROKE IS LIKE BEING
ROASTED ALIVE.
YOU FEEL DIZZY, EXHAUSTED, AND
YOU FEEL HOT, AND AFTER THE
FIRST FEW SECONDS OF SHADE AND
WATER, I IMMEDIATELY FELT
BETTER.
I NIGH -- KNEW I WASN'T GETTING
PULLED FROM THE GAME.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: LET'S SEE WHAT
HAPPENS WITH THE OTHER TWO
TRIBES.
KEEP HER COVERS, JOE.
IT'S NOW BEAUTY AND BRAWN FOR
SECOND PLACE.
BEAUTY HAS SCORED FIVE BALLS
SINCE THE MEDICAL SITUATION.
THEY HAVE ONE LEFT.
BRAWN STILL LOOKING FOR THEIR
THIRD BAG.
THE ONLY THING THE BRAWN TRIBE
HASN'T DONE IS JUST GIVE UP.
 HEY GUYS, TEAMWORK, TEAMWORK.
WE GOT THIS.
 IT'S ABOUT BEING A TEAM.
 I GOT TWO BAGS.
HOW MANY YOU GOT?
 I THINK WE DUG THIS PART.
 JUST SHUT UP AND DIG.
PLEASE.
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A JERK.
I JUST WANT THE FIND THESE.
 Jeff: BEAUTY IS ALL AROUND
THAT SIXTH TARGET.
THEY CAN'T CLOSE THE DEAL.
CALEB NOW GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
 YOU GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT.
 Jeff: OUT OF NOWHERE, JASON
WITH THE THIRD BAG FOR THE BRAWN
TRIBE.
LET'S GO, BRAWN.
YOU ARE BACK IN THIS.
CALEB NOW FEELING THE PRESSURE.
BEAUTY HAS FIVE OF THEIR SIX.
THEY ONLY NEED ONE MORE.
CAN HE DO IT?
MISSES AGAIN.
THIS IS A CARNIVAL GAME IN WHICH
YOU CAN GET LUCKY IN A HURRY.
JASON GOING TO GO UP FOR THE
BRAWN TRIBE.
YOU CAN ROLL AS MANY BALLS AS
ONCE AS YOU WANT.
JASON ROLLING AS FAST AS HE.
CAN JASON WITH HIS FIRST.
CALEB FOR THE ONE RIGHT HERE.
NO.
SCOT COMING IN.
 WE'RE STILL IN THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, SCOT.
 LET'S GO, SCOT.
 SCOT NAILS THE SECOND ONE FOR
THE BRAWN TRIBE.
SCOT WITH THIRD BALL FOR THE
BRAWN TRIBE.
IT IS NOW 5-3.
BRAWN IS CATCHING UP.
CALEB, IS THAT IT?
YES!
BEAUTY PULLS IT OUT,
SECOND-PLACE FINISH, REWARD FOR
BEAUTY.
REWARD FOR BRAINS.
NOTHING FOR BRAWN.
BUT AN EMPTY, LONELY AFTERNOON
BACK AT CAMP.
 OH, MY GOD, GUYS.
YES!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JOE, GIVE
ME THE UPDATE NOW.
HOW'S SHE DOING?
 SHE'S DOING BETTER NOW.
SHE HAD A HIGH TEMPERATURE TO
START WITH.
 I'M STILL SMILING.
I'M COOL.
 HER HEART RATE WAS QUITE
HIGH, AS WELL.
HER TEMPERATURE IS BACK DOWN TO
NORMAL.
 CALEB, WATER?
 IT'S HOT OUT HERE.
WORKING AS HARD AS THESE GUYS
ARE AT THIS TEMPERATURE, IT'S
DIFFICULT FOR YOUR BODY TO
MAINTAIN.
 DO YOU DMEED MEDICAL?
HE NEEDS MEDICAL.
 MEDICAL, TAKE A LOOK AT
CALEB, TOO.
 HEADS UP, GUYS.
MOVE OUT, MOVE OUT, MOVE OUT.
TAI, MOVE OUT OF THE WAY,
PLEASE.
WE GOT SOME WATER COMING.
HANG IN THERE, RIGHT?
LET'S GO.
WE NEED WATER, WATER, WATER!
 YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, CALEB.
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.
MEDICAL IS US WITH.
LET'S GO.
PUT SOME ON HIM.
WE'RE RIGHT HERE WITH YOU,
BUDDY.
YOU'RE IN REALLY GOOD HANDS.
DEEP BREATHS, OKAY.
 Jeff: LET'S GET A REFLECTOR
AND SOMEBODY TO THIS A LITTLE
FANNING.
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON, JOE.
 CALEB IS GOING INTO HEAT
STROKE WITH THE TEMPERATURE.
 TAKE IT EASY.
NICE, STEADY BREATHING.
STAY WITH US, BIG GUY.
 CYDNEY, HOW YOU FEELING?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
 WE'VE GOT A WHOLE MEDICAL
TEAM HERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
[SOBBING].
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY
ON THE CREW IS ESSENTIAL
PERSONNEL.
UMBRELLAS, COOLERS, WATER, FIND
A SPOT TO HELP.
 THANK YOU, SIR.
 CALEB, I'M GOING TO PUT A
MASK ON TO HELP YOU BREATHE.
KEEP GOING WITH THE WATER ON HIS
CHEST, PLEASE.
KEEP COOLING HIM DOWN.
TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
 Jeff: CALEB, YOU'RE STILL
HERE, BUDDY, RIGHT?
YOU'RE IN GOOD HAND, BUDDY.
CALEB?
CALEB?
 CALEB, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CALEB, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CALEB, YOU STILL WITH US?
CALEB, YOU STILL WITH US?
 Jeff: CALEB?
 OH, MY GOD.
 HOW YOU DOING?
STAY WITH US.
ALL RIGHT.
 Jeff: HEY, CALEB.
CALEB.
CALEB.
 CALEB, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CALEB, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WE'RE RIGHT HERE WITH
YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
STAY WITH US.
I SEE YOU NODDING.
 DEEP BREATH, CALEB.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME?
SOMEBODY FETCH ME TWO BAGS OF
SALINE.
CAN YOU HOLD HIS LEGS STILL,
PLEASE.
[SOBBING]
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
JUST BRING IT ALL OVER.
 Jeff: SO, JOE, YOU'RE
GIVING HIM FLU WINDS TO
REHYDRATE AND WHAT?
 WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM SOME
COLD TRAIN VENOUS FLUIDS TO
BRING HIS TEMPERATURE DOWN AND
HELP HYDRATE HIM.
 Jeff: AND YOU'RE MONITORING
HIS TEMPERATURE?
 WE ARE, YEAH.
CAREFUL, MATE.
 HOLD MY HAND.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
BLOOD PRESSURE IS 146/94.
 Jeff: CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?
JASON IS TAKING REALLY GOOD CARE
OF YOU RIGHT NOW.
MEDICAL IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR
DEALING WITH CALEB.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN
EVACUATION.
CALL FOR THE CHOPPER.
ASAP ON THE CHOPPER.
 WE NEED THE BIG STRETCHERS.
 I GOT THIS STRETCHER RIGHT
HERE.
 CYDNEY'S DOWN, AS WELL.
 GET YOUR BREATHING UNDER
CONTROL.
 STAY CALM.
BREATHE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JOE,
WHAT'S THE UPDATE ON CYDNEY?
 HOW YOU DOING, CYDNEY IN
 I'M OKAY.
 Jeff: TEMPERATURE IS DOWN.
TEMPERATURE IS BACK TO NORMAL.
 I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP HER
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY DANGER OF
BEING PULLED FROM THE GAME.
BUT WE ARE RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
OKAY.
CALEB, YOU KNOW THERE ARE ONLY
TWO WAYS YOU LEAVE THIS GAME,
OTHER THAN BEING VOTED OUT,
THAT'S QUITTING AND THAT IS THE
DOCTORS SAYING THEY ARE TOO
WORRIED ABOUT YOU TO LET YOU
CONTINUE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PULLED.
BUDDY, YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
IT'S THE DOCTOR'S CALL.
YOU PUSHED VERY HARD, AND IT
TOOK A TOLL.
THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU'RE GOING
TO GO.
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.
YOU'RE A WARRIOR, DUDE.
I'M GLAD YOU WERE OUT HERE.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: OKAY, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
SO OBVIOUSLY A CRAZY DAY.
ARE YOU GUYS DOING OKAY?
 IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING.
 Jeff: OKAY.
WELL, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
CYDNEY'S FINE.
DEBBIE IS FINE.
WE ARE GOING TO EVACUATE CALEB.
 ARE YOU PULLING HIM OUT OF
THE GAME RIGHT NOW?
 YOU'RE PUTTING HIM OUT.
 Jeff: CALEB IS OUT?
 OUT, OUT?
 Jeff: CALEB IS OUT OF THE
GAME?
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HE'S OUT.
 Jeff: THAT BIRD IS COMING
IN FOR CALEB.
I WISH IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS
WAY.
GIVE HIM ONE SECOND HERE, ONE
SECOND.
 BYE, CALEB.
 TAKE CARE, CALEB.
 WE LOVE YOU.
WE LOVE YOU.
[SOBBING]
 HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'LL BE FINE.
 I HOPE CALEB'S OKAY.
 I DO, TOO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GIVE EVERYBODY AN UPDATE.
THIS IS CLEARLY UNPRECEDENTED,
THREE PEOPLE GOING DOWN IN ONE
CHALLENGE SIMPLY DUE TO THE
EXTREME HEAT, COMBINATION OF
DEHYDRATION AND HUGE EFFORT.
THERE'S NOBODY HERE PHONING IT
IN.
EVERY ONE OF YOU GUYS WAS
DIGGING, DIGGING, DIGGING AND
FIGHTING.
SO WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW, TAI?
YOU WERE VERY EMOTIONAL.
 I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE LOSING ONE OF OUR OWN.
WE WORKED SO HARD AND CALEB
GIVES 100%.
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF SO WE CAN
DO THIS CHALLENGE.
LAST NIGHT I CUDDLED WITH HIM.
I'M GOING TO MISS HIM SO MUCH.
 Jeff: JASON, IS IT POSSIBLE
FOR YOU IN THIS GAME TO HAVE
JUST TAKEN CYDNEY, CAN YOU STILL
VOTE HER OUT OF THIS GAME.
 I COME FROM THE MILITARY.
SOMEONE GETS HURTS, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE MISSION ANYMORE, IT'S
ABOUT THAT PERSON.
THAT'S YOU TEAMMATE.
HERE WE LIVE WITH EACH OTHER.
WE DON'T ALL LIKE EACH OTHER,
BUT END OF THE DAY, WE'RE
FAMILY.
THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE DEALT.
YOU DEAL WITH IT.
SO I'M GOING TO STAY WITH HER
UNTIL THE BITTER END.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
BRAIN TRIBE, YOUR REWARD WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.
BEAUTY TRIBE, YOUR REWARD WILL
BE WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.
BEAUTY TRIBE IS DOWN A MEMBER.
NINE DAYS IN, GAME CONTINUES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, GET SOME
SHADE.
DRINK SOME WATER.
GOOD LUCK.
 WITHOUT CALEB, IT'S SO SAD.
HE'S GOING TO BE IN MY HEART FOR
A LONG TIME.
I'M SURE I'LL SEE HIM AGAIN, I
STILL WANT THE HAVE THAT KISS
FROM HIM.
BEFORE CALEB WAS GONE, THREE
BOYS AGAINST THREE GIRLS.
BUT NOW IT'S ONLY NICK AND I.
NOW THE GIRLS HAVE THEIR CHOICE
WHO TO KICK OUT.
SO THE IDOL IS MORE IMPORTANT
NOW, BECAUSE IF WE GO TO TRIBAL,
THERE'S A 50/50 CHANCE I'M GOING
HOME, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO
HOME WITH AN IDOL IN MY POCKET.
 HOLY CRAP, WHAT A DAY.
THAT WAS CRAZY.
ALL I KNOW IS JOE IS LOOKING AT
ME, AND I'M FEELING LIKE SO
UNBELIEVABLY HOT, AND HE SAYS,
"SHOULD I GET MEDICAL, SHOULD I
GET MEDICAL," AND I'M LIKE NO,
NO, BECAUSE IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
I WAS GOING THE TOUGH IT OUT,
AND HE FINALLY GOES, "I'M
GETTING MEDICAL," AND THANK GOD
HE DID.
MY BIGGEST FEAR WAS NOT ONLY
WOULD I APPEAR WEAK TO MY TRIBE,
BUT I WOULD APPEAR WEAK TO MY
DAUGHTERS BACK HOME.
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS A
ROLE MODEL TO MY DAUGHTERS.
MY DAUGHTERS OFTEN TELL ME THAT
THEY ARE... MY DAUGHTERS OFTEN
TELL ME HOW PROUD THEY ARE OF
ME, AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF
STUPID STUFF IN MY LIFE.
CRYSTAL ALWAYS TELLS ME, YOU'RE
THE BEST MOM, AND JADE SAYS,
YOU'RE WONDER WOMAN.
AND THEY WERE REALLY PROUD OF ME
TO COME HERE, AND I... I JUST
DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THEM.
BEYOND THIS GAME, WE'RE FRIENDS
FOR LIFE.
I MEAN THAT, YOU GUYS REALLY
TOOK CARE OF ME.
 I MIGHT NOT BE AS BIG AS YOU
AND AS STRONG AS YOU, BUT YOU
SHOULD KNOW FROM THE NARK WHEN
WE'RE ALL NOT GIVING UP AND I'M
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE YOU, TO LOOK
ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND SAY,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP BEING A
CHEERLEADER, THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GOOD AT.
THAT'S NOT WORKING AS TEAM.
WHAT WOULD ONE OF YOUR PLAYERS
SAY IN A BASKETBALL GAME.
 FIRST OF ALL, IN NAN GAME,
THERE'S WORKING IN THE BEST IN
THE WORLD.
THERE'S NO COMPARISON.
 I WASN'T TRYING TO START
DRAMA WITH SCOT, BUT I JUST
WANTED TO CONFRONT HIM ABOUT THE
SITUATION.
I WAS TRYING MY BEST.
I NEVER GAVE UP.
IN THE REWARD CHALLENGE, I KEPT
SAYING, COME ON GUYS, WE CAN DO
THAT.
AND SCOT GOES, LET HER KEEP
BEING A CHEERLEADER.
THAT'S ALL SHE'S GOOD AT.
 ON THE ONE HAND I WAS
THINKING, SHUT UP.
ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE IS
HELPING, SHE IS STAYING
POSITIVE, SO I MEND IT WHEN I
SAID, KEEP CHEERLEADING.
 I WAS TRYING MY BEST.
I JUST DON'T HAVE AS BIG OF
HANDs AS YOU.
 I KNOW THIS.
 I'M NOT INTIMIDATED BY HIM
BECAUSE HE'S BIGGER THAN ME OR
STRONGER THAN ME.
I'M GOING TO LET HIM KNOW HOW I
FEEL.
I WANT OUR TRIBE TO WORK MORE AS
TEAM AND TO NOT PUT EACH OTHER
DOWN.
WITH ME, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST
KEEP DOING IT.
SO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY TO BREAK
ME DOWN IN A CHALLENGE WHEN I'M
PART OF THE TEAM.
 I'M NOT TRYING TO BREAK YOU
DOWN.
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU TO SHUT
UP AND DIG.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU SAID SHUT UP AND DIG BECAUSE
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GOOD AT.
 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON TEAM IN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE -- WHAT TEAM
HAVE YOU BEEN ON?
 I PLAYED SOCCER.
WHETHER IT'S AN NBA GAME OR A
LITTLE KIDS' FOOTBALL GAME, THE
MORAL OF THE STORY IS TO ACT
LIKE A TEAM TO, HAVE TEAMWORK.
 SO WHY DON'T YOU GET ON BOARD
WITH THIS TEAM?
 COMING BACK TO CAMP AFTER MY
LITTLE THING, IT WAS LIKE,
RECOUP, THAT'S MY MAIN THING.
NEXT THING I KNOW, PEOPLE START
HOLLERING.
I'M LIKE, Y'ALL MESSING MY
RECUPERATION.
 THERE MIGHT BE A SPLIT
TOMORROW, AND I REALLY HOPE
THERE IS.
 YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE EVEN HERE
STILL BECAUSE THE NEXT TRIBAL,
BYE-BYE.
 THE BRAWN TEAM IS... WE JUST
DO EVERYTHING INTENSELY.
AND I DO NOT THINK ALECIA IS
AWARE OF PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.
I'M JUST LIKE, GIRL, COME ON,
JUST LISTEN AND PAY ATTENTION.
 I MEAN, YOU SAID TODAY BY ME
BEING ENCOURAGING DURING THE
CHALLENGE THAT THAT WAS WRONG.
 IT WAS THE WRONG TIME.
 THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING.
AND THERE AGAIN...
 SO...
 YOU CAN'T EVEN SIT THERE FOR
ONE SECOND AND GO, MAYBE THESE
THREE ARE RIGHT.
 THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXECUTION,
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
IT'S ALWAYS I GUESS NOT.
TAKE A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY IN
YOUR LIFE.
I DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK ALECIA
GETS THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT'S
GOING ON AROUND HER IN THIS
WORLD, BUT I WENT A LITTLE
OVERBOARD.
I GET ANGRY.
YOU KNOW, I RAISED TWO DAUGHTERS
THAT ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORLD TO
ME.
I WANT THEM TO BE STRONG, VERY
EDUCATED, INDEPENDENT FEMALES
THAT ARE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF
THEMSELVES WITHOUT THEIR DAD
EVER.
AND IT UPSETS ME TO SEE A GIRL
LIKE ALECIA WHO YOU CAN'T EVEN
HOLD A CONVERSATION WITH HER.
 YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
THAT JUST LIKES TO ARGUE.
 ALECIA IS SO FAR ON THE
BOTTOM NOW, WE'RE JUST WAITING.
THAT TRIBAL COUNCIL IS SIGNED,
SEALED AND DELIVERED.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING?
ARE YOU GUYS TAKING CARE OF
YOURSELVES GIVEN WHAT WE JUST
WENT THROUGH?
 YES.
 YEAH.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: DID IT UP THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THE GAME AND HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO STAY
HYDRATED?
 YES.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING CARE OF
OURSELVES.
WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
GOT TO TAKE THEM BACK.
CYDNEY, I KNOW YOU HATE TO GIVE
IT UP.
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO
GIVE IT UP.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, TWO TRIBE
MEMBERS WILL RACE INTO THE
JUNGLE, CLIMB UP A WOODEN LADDER
AND RETRIEVE PUZZLE PIECES.
THEN YOU'LL BRING THEM BACK.
THEN TWO MORE TRIBE MEMBERS WILL
DIVE DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND
RETRIEVE MORE PUZZLE PIECES.
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL THE
PUZZLE PIECES, YOU WILL USE THEM
TO COMPLETE A SNAKE PUZZLE.
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH
WIN IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE
VOTE.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT.
BEAUTY TRIBE, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY
OUT.
CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME PEOPLE
IN BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.
JULIA AND ANNA MUST PARTICIPATE.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
 I AM.
 Jeff: TAI WILL SIT OUT.
BRAIN TRIBE, ONE EXTRA PERSON.
 JOE.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY ELSE, TAKE
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST YOU GOT TO RACE INTO THE
JUNGLE AND GET YOUR FIRST THREE
PIECES.
BRAWN IS UP FIRST.
THERE GOES BEAUTY AND NOW
BRAINS.
THREE PIECES.
GET THEM UNTIED, GET THEM DOWN
AND HEAD BACK.
EVERYBODY PRETTY EVEN.
DEBBIE WORKING ON THAT THIRD FOR
THE BRAIN.
CYDNEY WORKING ON THAT THIRD FOR
BRAWN.
 GET THE ONE UNDER.
 Jeff: JULIA HAS THE THIRD
FOR BEAUTY.
EVERYBODY HAS THEM.
NOW YOU GOT THE PICK THEM UP AND
HEAD DOWN.
DEB, YOU TWO.
 I GOT ONE.
YOU HAVE TWO.
 Jeff: BRAIN TRIBE FORGOT
ONE OF THEIR PIECES, GOT TO GO
BACK, LOSING VALUABLE TIME.
BRAWN BACK FIRST.
SCOT AND JASON HEADING INTO THE
WATER.
BEAUTY IS BACK.

BEAUTY IS RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
BRAIN HAD SOME TROUBLE FIGURING
OUT WHO HAD WHAT.
 COME ON, KEEP MOVING.
 Jeff: BRAIN NOW HEADING

YOU GOT THREE MORE PUZZLE PIECES
DOWN THERE.
UNTIE THE KNOT TO RELEASE THEM.
HERE COMES NEAL AND AUBRY.
THERE'S NICK AND MICHELE FOR

WATER WHILE UNTYING KNOTS.
HERE COMES THE BRAIN TRIBE.
AUBRY HEADING DOWN.

LONGER.

PIECES.
THEY'RE HEADING BACK.

 Jeff: GO, BEAUTY TRIBE.
ANNA AND JULIA GOING TO WORK ON
THE PUZZLE.
GO, BRAWN TRIBE!
IT'S GOING TO BE CYDNEY AND
ALECIA FOR THE BRAWN TRIBE.
NEAL AND AUBRY STILL IN THE
WATER.
JULIA AND ANNA MAKING PROGRESS
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.
 IT'S THE LITTLE ONE.
THE LITTLE ONE GOES LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: IT ONLY GOES TOGETHER
ONE WAY, BUT IT WILL FOOL YOU
WITH PIECES THAT FIT, BUT
THEY'RE IN THE WRONG SPOT.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
THERE.
 COME ON, BABY.
LET'S GO, GIRLFRIEND.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: AUBRY BACK.
IT IS NEAL AND DEBBIE FOR THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
 THEY MEET AT THE JUNCTION.
 Jeff: THIS REALLY COMES
DOWN TO YOUR ABILITY TO WORK
TOGETHER AND TRY A LOT OF
OPTIONS WHILE STILL SEEING THE
BIGGER PICTURE.
 THIS WAY.
NO, NO.
 Jeff: PETER'S GOING TO GET
IN THIS CHALLENGE.
 PETER, COME.
 Jeff: DEB AND PETER GOING
TO SWAP OUT.
THE BRAWN TRIBE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT IS WRONG.
BEAUTY HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE.
BRAIN TRIBE HAS MADE UP A LOT OF
TIME.
 YOUR NEURONS ARE FIRING ON
ALL CYLINDERS.
LET'S GO, BOYS.
 WE GOT IT, DEB.
BOO YEAH!
 Jeff: BRAINS THINK THEY
HAVE IT.
AND THEY DO!
PETER CAME IN AND IT WAS OVER.
LOOKING FOR SECOND PLACE NOW.
 SWAP OUT.
ANNA, SWAP OUT.
 Jeff: BEAUTY TRIBE MAKING A
SWAP.
CAN NICK DO FOR BEAUTY WHAT
PETER DID FOR BRAIN?
NICK GETTING SOME MOMENTUM.
HE'S GOT SOME IDEAS.
BEAUTY HAS MADE A LOT OF
PROGRESS.
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A
STRUGGLE.
THE BRAWN TRIBE.
BEAUTY MAKING ANOTHER
ADJUSTMENT.
IS THIS IT?
LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE.
AND IT IS.
BEAUTY WINS AND AVOIDS TRIBAL
COUNCIL FOR FOURTH STRAIGHT
TIME, SENDING BRAWN BACK TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
DEJECTION ALL AROUND.
WHAT'S THE FEELING, ALECIA IN
 NOT VERY GOOD.
I MEAN, I TRIED.
 WE TRIED.
 WE TRIED, YEAH.
 Jeff: SCOT, DOES THAT
EXCHANGE SUM IT UP?
ALECIA SAYS I TRIED...
 I THINK ALECIA FEELS SHE HAS
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HERSELF
TO GIVE HERSELF VALIDATION.
I TRIED.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE AT
ALL.
 Jeff: WOW.
TRIBAL IS GOING TO BE FUN
TONIGHT.
 JEFF ASKED ALECIA A QUESTION,
AND ALECIA RESPONDED BACK WITH
HER FAMOUS WORDS, "I DID MY
BEST."
IT'S ALL ABOUT HER, HER, HER,
HER.
 Jeff: BRAIN TRIBE,
CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: IMMUNITY AGAIN.
NOBODY GOING HOME.
BEAUTY TRIBE, STILL AVOIDING
COMING TO SEE ME AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
BEAUTY TRIBE SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
ALL RIGHT, BRAIN TRIBE, GRAB
YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
BEAUTY TRIBE, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
WHICH BRINGS US BACK THE A
FAMILIAR STORY.
THE BRAWN TRIBE.
SO, BRAWN TRIBE, JUST THE BODY
LISTENING WAJ ALONE SAYS
EVERYTHING.
THIS IS NOT A HAPPY TRIBE.
 NOT RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: ALECIA, DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU GET PICKED ON ALLOTTED
IN THIS TRIBE.
 I DO.
WHEN I REPLIED SAYING, "I
TRIED," MEANING TO SAY I TRIED
AND SHE DIDN'T.
I DO TAKE BLAME FOR NOT GETTING
THE PUZZLE TONIGHT.
 Jeff: WHAT ARE THE ODDS YOU
SURVIVE TONIGHT'S VOTE YOU'RE
ALREADY HOLDING UP A ZERO.
ALECIA IS GOING HOME?
 IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
IT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.
 WE CAN VOTE NOW.
 I'LL DO TRIBAL RIGHT THIS
SECOND.
 Jeff: ALECIA HAS TO AGREE
TO THAT.
 I'M NOT DOING TRIBAL RIGHT
NOW.
THAT WOULD BE GIVING UP.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
LY SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
WHETHER IT'S A LONG ONE OR VERY
SHORT ONE.
 Jeff: HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?
SCOT, YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY?
 I FEEL THE SAME WAY.
 Jeff: CYDNEY?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: ALECIA, YOU HAVE
THREE PEOPLE SAYING THE SAME
THING, AND YOU'RE IN AN
INTERESTING SITUATION.
YOU'RE NOT ON THE BRAWN TRIBE
BECAUSE YOU'RE HUGE PHYSICALLY.
 COME ON, JEFF.
 Jeff: YOU'RE ON THE BRAWN
TRIBE BECAUSE YOU DON'T TAKE ANY
LIP FROM ANYBODY AT ANY TIME FOR
ANY REASON.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
 I AGREE.
I'M OPINIONATED.
BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT ALL, I
HAVEN'T FELT A GOOD CONNECTION
WITH SCOT AND JASON, AND SO A
LOT OF THE TIMES WHEN THEY TALK
TO ME, I CHOOSE NOT TO LISTEN.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH
RESPECT FOR THEM.
 Jeff: SO SCOT, ALECIA IS
SAYING YOU HAVE TO EARN HER
RESPECT BEFORE SHE WILL LISTEN
TO YOU, AND YOU HAVEN'T EARNED
HER RESPECT.
 IF I HAVEN'T, NO ONE CAN.
SHE FINDS ONE THING THAT SHE'S
EVER DONE RIGHT AND SHE ARGUES
THAT POINT UNTIL SOMEONE LOSES
THEIR TEMPER AND I SAW HER DO IT
AND JASON LOST HIS TEMPER, SO
THAT SHOWS ME THAT SHE NEEDS
ATTENTION TO THE POINT THAT IT
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S POSITIVE
OR NEGATIVE.
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.
 Jeff: ALECIA, I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO BE VOTED OUT
TONIGHT.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
THEY'RE VOTING ANYBODY ELSE
TONIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SEEN A
TRIBAL THAT WAS THIS CLEAR-CUT.
AND YET I STILL ROOT FOR YOU.
 I MEAN, I DEFINITELY WANT TO
BE HERE LONGER.
I THINK THAT I HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO GET TO THE END.
IF I DID LEAVE TONIGHT, I COULD
BE ALL NEGATIVE ABOUT IT, OR I
COULD TAKE WHAT I LEARN, AND
THAT'S HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE
THINGS I HAVE.
AND SOMETIMES EXPERIENCES CAN BE
WORTH MORE THAN MONEY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE I'VE MISSED BEFORE
WE VOTE?
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CYDNEY, YOU'RE UP.
 I REALLY HOPE YOU WATCH THIS
OVER AND OVER AND UNDERSTAND
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO HELP YOU.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO
DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE ALECIA.
SCOT.
ALECIA.
THAT'S TWO VOTES ALECIA.
ONE VOTE SCOT.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT, ALECIA.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
ALECIA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, CYDNEY.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: WELL, IF THERE'S BEEN
ONE THING CONSISTENT ON THIS
TRIBE, IT'S THE THREE OF YOU.
IS THAT BOND ENOUGH TO GET THREE
OF YOU TO THE END?
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I'VE NEVER BEEN AROUND
ELEMENTS LIKE THIS, AND COMING
TO WHERE I HAVE NO SHELTER AND
IN FOOD, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
CHANGED ME AS A PERSON.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M PROUD
OF MYSELF.
I DON'T THINK I GAVE UP.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THIS SEASON THE
LINES OF POWER HAVE BEEN DRAWN.
 I'M THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE
SCENES.
 I THINK WE'RE IN A REALLY
GOOD POSITION.
 WE KIND OF HOLD ALL THE
POWER.
 Jeff: BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO
BE ERASED.
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.
WE'RE SWITCHING THINGS UP.
 MY "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE WAS
LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER DONE
BEFORE.
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO SEE THAT
EASY OR JUST SAY TRY IT, THIS IS
THE REAL DEAL.
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE AS
TOUGH AS IT REALLY IS.
IT WAS FUN.
IT PUSHED MY BODY TO THE LIMITS.
THE DOCTORS WERE GREAT.
IT'S ONE OF THEM EXPERIENCES
THAT I WOUND HONESTLY DO
