 --- 

         I GET BY ON MY SOCIAL SKILLS,
BUT I'M A JERSEY GIRL, AND YOU
GOT TO GET SCRAPPY SOMETIMES.
YOU HAD IT OUT FOR ME.
I DIDN'T GET HERE BY LUCK.
IT HAS TO BE LIKE TWO STEPS
AHEAD.
I DIDN'T SLIDE THROUGH.
 Jeff: MICHELE WINS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!
 MICHELE HAS NOT PISSED OFF
ANYONE ON THAT JURY.
SHE IS THE BIGGEST SOCIAL THREAT
IN THIS GAME.
 BLIND SIDED.
 I WANT THE MAKE A MOVE THAT
DOES SOLIDIFY MY TITLE AS








SOMEBODY WHO EARNED IT.
 Jeff: FRESH OFF WINNING $1
MILLION, MICHELE.
LET'S GET INTO IT.
THE REUNION SHOWS ALWAYS GO VERY
FAST.
THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT
APPROACHES WITH YOU AND AUBRY
AND TAI.
WHAT WAS THE KEY FOR YOU?
WHAT WAS YOUR GAME PLAY ABOUT?
 YEAH, WELL, I PLAYED A REALLY
SOCIAL GAME.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY EVIDENT,
BUT I THINK MY SOCIAL GAME WAS
BASED ON... NOT BASED ON
EMOTION.
I THINK IT WAS REALLY ABOUT
GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE ON A
PERSONAL LEVEL AS A FRIENDSHIP
FIRST.
 Jeff: IT SEEMED TO ME YOU
STAYED IN THE MIDDLE REALLY








WELL.
YOU NEVER COMMITTED ANYWHERE.
YOU WERE JUST KNOWING WHEN TO
BOUNCE.
 I THINK THAT I DID PLAY IN
THE MIDDLE A LOT.
I PLAYED IN THE MIDDLE WITH
NICK.
I PLAYED IN THE MIDDLE WITH
JULIA.
I PLAYED IN THE MIDDLE WITH
CYDNEY, WHICH IS A DANGERIOUS
PLACE THE PLAY, BUT I WASN'T
BEING BLAMED FOR ANYTHING.
MY NAME WASN'T ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK QUITE OFTEN.
 Jeff: IF THAT'S THE
STRATEGY YOU USED, IT'S TOUGH TO
GET TO THE END, IS THE KEY
KNOWING WHEN TO HOP TO THE NEXT
OPPORTUNITY?
 YES, THE KEY IS ABSOLUTELY
KNOWING WHEN TO HOP.
IT'S KNOWING WHO TO TRUST.
IT'S KNOWING WHEN THE FEELING...
THE VIBE OF CAMP SHIFTS.
IT'S KNOWING HOW THE REMAIN CALM
ENOUGH IN ORDER TO FEEL THAT
SHIFT AND KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,
TRUST YOUR LOYALTY AND WHO
YOU'RE WITH AND WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING TO YOU.
 Jeff: ANOTHER THING I THINK
REALLY HELPED YOU, AND SOME OF
THE JURY MEMBERS ELUDED TO IT,
YOU WERE AN UNDERDOG IN THE
BEGINNING BECAUSE WE PUT YOU IN
THESE GROUPS.
YOU WERE IN BEAUTY FOR YOUR
PHYSICAL BEAUTY, AND PEOPLE
LOOKED AT YOU AND SAID, OKAY,
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND YOU
WERE ABLE TO USE THAT STORY TO
GROW IN FRONT OF PEOPLE'S EYES.
 YEAH.
I GUESS I DID HAVE A BIT OF AN
UNDERDOG STORY IN THE SENSE THAT
I CAME IN AS A BEAUTY TRIBE
GIRL, WHO JULIA SAID IT AND NICK
SAID IT, AS WELL, JULIA SAID I
CAME IN AS THE WEAKEST BEAUTY
GIRL IN THE TRIBE.
NICK SAID I NEED TO PROVE I WAS
INTELLIGENT.
YOU KNOW, BRAIN AND BRAWN COME
IN AS PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE
SMART OR KNOWN TO BE TOUGH.
AS BEAUTY, YOU HAVE TO PROVE
THOSE THINGS, AND I PLAYED UNDER
THE RADAR A LITTLE BIT.
YOU SAW WITH NICK THAT I DUMBED
MYSELF DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
AND WHEN I HAD TO COME OUT
SCREAMING, KICKING, FIGHTING, I
DID.
AND...
 Jeff: IT WORKED.
NICE JOB.
 IT WORKED.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: WELL, MUCH LIKE
MICHELE DID, WATCHING SOMEBODY
BLOSSOM AND GROW I THINK FOR A
LOT OF FANS IS ONE OF THE MOST
ENJOYABLE ASPECTS OF "SURVIVOR."
AND NOBODY GREW MORE FROM DAY
ONE IN THE SHELTER CRYING TO DAY
39 IN THE FINAL THREE THAN
AUBRY.
 I GET STUCK IN MY OWN HEAD.
IT'S THE HEART AND THE BRAIN
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING.
THIS IS ABOUT PROVING MYSELF
THAT THIS IS A HARD-ASS GAME AND
I CAN DO IT.
 I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.
 PITTER AM I, PAL.
 Jeff: AUBRY WINS REWARD!
 I'VE GONE FROM SUCH A
TRANSFORMATION.
THIS GAME SHOOK ME OUT OF MY
CRAZINESS AND TAUGHT ME, IT'S
OKAY IF PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU TO
BE A THREAT.
 UH-HUH.
 Jeff: SO AUBRY, A
SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN, TRY TO
EXPLAIN HOW SOMEBODY CAN GET SO
OVERWHELMED IN THIS GAME
INSTANTLY?
 SURE.
SO I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW.
YOU GET ON THERE.
THERE'S ALL OF THESE THINGS TO
PROCESS.
THERE'S THE FLAG.
YOU GET DEHYDRATEDDED.
YOU START THE FEEL A LITTLE
FUNKY.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE
FREAKING OUT ABOUT FREAKING OUT
AND THERE'S MANGO ALL OVER YOUR
FACE.
AND YOU'RE CRYING IN THE
SHELTER.
 Jeff: I SAW SOMETHING YOU
POSTED.
DEBBIE CALLED YOU I THINKER IN
ROTTIC NERD TO GEEK WARRIOR,
RIGHT?
AND THEN YOU POSTED ON TWITTER,
THROW THAT UP.
YOU POSTED A PHOTO OF YOU WITH
COCHRAN, SORT OF COMPARING
YOURSELF TO COCHRAN.
THERE IT IS.
IN FACT, I THINK COCHRAN IS HERE
TONIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A SHOT.
THERE HE IS.
YES.
AND COCHRAN IS KNOWN NOW AS AN
ARCHETYPE ON "SURVIVOR."
DID YOU FEEL THAT?
DID YOU FEEL YOU BLOSSOMED FROM
NERD TO WARRIOR IN
 I DEFINITELY DO.
COCHRAN'S KIND OF MY "SURVIVOR"
SPIRIT ANIMAL BECAUSE HE IS A
LITTLE NEUROTIC.
HE'S ROCKING REALLY COOL FRAMES,
AND I THINK HE'S JUST REALLY
GOOD AT KNOWING HOW PEOPLE ARE
THE WAY THEY ARE, WHAT MAKES HIM
TICK AND HOW HE FITS INTO A
GROUP.
SO I THINK I UNDERSTOOD THAT.
 Jeff: AND NOBODY WOULD SEE
YOU AS AN UNDERDOG TODAY?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 Jeff: THAT KIND OF ANSWERS
MY QUESTION ABOUT FANS.
YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY
SAYING THAT THEY APPRECIATED YOU
SHOWING YOUR TRUTH BECAUSE A LOT
OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO FEELING
THAT FEELING OF OVERWHELMED.
DID YOU GET A LOT OF THAT FROM
PEOPLE?
 YES, I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE
TELLING ME HOW IF THEY WERE ON
"SURVIVOR," THAT'S HOW THEY
WOULD ACT.
IT WAS SUPER HUMBLING.
IT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF MY
LIFE.
IT CHANGED ME FOR THE BETTER.
AND IF THAT GAVE PEOPLE
SOMETHING, LIKE THOSE PEOPLE
GIVE AS MUCH TO ME, SO I'M SUPER
GRATEFUL.
 Jeff: NICE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, EVERY SO OFTEN, WE HAVE A
PLAYER THAT IS SO UNIQUE AND SO
CAPTURES THE HEART OF THE
AUDIENCE THAT THEY TRANSEND THE
"SURVIVOR" ARCHETYPE AND CREATE
A NEW ONE.
WE'VE HAD NEARLY 500 PEOPLE PLAY
THIS GAME.
WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE LIKE
TAI.
 IT'S EXCITING.
I CAN'T SIT STILL.
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."
IT'S ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME.
I FOUND THE IDOL.
I WORKED SO HARD FOR THIS.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE ALL LIVING CREATURES.
AND I BELIEVE IN GOODNESS IN
HUMANITY.
YOU HAVE TO KISS ME.
"SURVIVOR" HAS TO BE THE HARDEST
THING I'VE EVER DONE.
IT REALLY TAKES A TOLL ON MY
EMOTION.
I'M LIKE A BAMBOO, WINDS KEEP
BLOWING, BLOWING, BLOWING.
I'M RESILIENT.
 Jeff: TAI WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
[APPLAUSE]
TAI, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN
BEHIND SOMEBODY, WHETHER YOU WIN
OR NOT, JUST THE SPIRIT YOU
BROUGHT TO THE SHOW, IT MUST BE
A CRAZY EXPERIENCE FOR YOU TO
HAVE PEOPLE COMING UP AND SAYING
THAT THEY ADMIRE YOU AND THAT
THEY LOVE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT.
 YEAH.
AS A GARDENER, I WORK OUTSIDE.
I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE COME UP TO
ME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
"SURVIVOR" IS BIG IN CAN DARK
AUSTRALIA, EVERYWHERE, AND KIDS
LOVE ME FOR SOME REASON.
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK I JUST... "SURVIVOR"
REALLY SCARED ME ON THE SOCIAL
GAME, BUT I'M COMING ALONG.
WOW.
I JUST WANT TO BE WHO I AM.
I THINK THAT'S JUST... I
CAN'T... "SURVIVOR" IS SO TOUGH.
IT STRIPPED OUT ALL... I MEAN,
YOU'RE COLD, YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU
STRIP OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
YOU CANNOT PRETEND YOU'RE
SOMEBODY ELSE YOU'RE NOT.
BUT FOR ME, I'M JUST WHO I AM.
I MEAN, EVERY DAY I LOOK AT ME.
I REALLY SAY ALL LIVING THINGS
MATTER TO ME.
EVERYTHING HAVE MEANING, LIVING
THINGS, SO, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
DOING THINGS...
 Jeff: OKAY THEN.
OKAY.
THEY SEE SOMETHING IN YOU.
 JEFF -- [INAUDIBLE].
 Jeff: OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?
OKAY.
WAIT.
GLEN, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, SLOW
DOWN.
THIS IS AN... THIS IS NOT A
MOMENT, BUT I KNOW WHO THIS IS.
WAIT.
SIA.
COME UP.
YOU DON'T HAVE A MIC.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
COME HERE, COME HERE.
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO, GLEN?
RIGHT HERE?
OKAY.
THIS REALLY IS SIA.
 TAI, TAI, TAI...
 Jeff: WE MET BECAUSE YOU'RE
A FAN OF "SURVIVOR" AND HAVE
BECOME FRIENDS.
I KNOW PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE
GOING, WHAT IS THIS BIT, AND I'M
TELLING YOU, YOU'RE ABOUT TO
TELL ME WHAT THIS BIT IS.
 I COULD NOT LET TAI GO HOME
WITHOUT SAYING THAT YOU'RE
AUTHENTICITY AND YOUR CARE FOR
ANIMALS REALLY INSPIRED ME, SO I
WANT TO DONATE $50,000 TO YOU,
AND I WANT TO DONATE $50,000 TO
YOUR CHOICE OF ANIMAL CHARITY,
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR SHOWING AMERICA HOW TO BE
KIND TO ANIMALS.
 Jeff: WOW.
YES.
 MAY GOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THAT IS VERY YEN ROUSE OF YOU.
 Jeff: WOW.
GLEN, GET A SHOT OF THE HOUSE,
BECAUSE WE HAVE A STANDING
OVATION HAPPENING HERE.
NOW, WHY... IS THIS LIKE A FAN
FAVORITE THING, BECAUSE PART OF
THE MONEY... YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GIVING MONEY TO TAI?
 YES.
WELL, I REMEMBER THAT YOU USED
TO GIVE MONEY THE FAN FAVORITE.
I WANTED TO DO IT FOR KEITH LAST
YEAR, BUT I WAS TOO CHICKEN,
PARDON THE PUN, AND THIS YEAR I
JUST WAS WATCHING YOU, TAI, AND
I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A
WEIRD LITTLE JOURNEY FOR YOU,
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THROUGH
IT ALL YOU SHOWED YOUR HUMANITY
AND LIKE WHEN YOU JUST SAID, I
WAS SCARED, AND THAT'S WHY YOU
VOTED OFF SCOT, YOU KNOW, THAT
WAS LIKE... THAT'S POWERFUL TO
ADMIT THE TRUTH IN THAT WAY.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE A TEACHER.
 Jeff: OKAY.
THIS IS CRAZY.
AND I LOVE THAT YOU'RE UP HERE,
SIA.
YES, TAI?
 I THINK I'M JUST... I REALLY
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING
AWARENESS OF ANIMAL... NOT JUST
ANIMAL, EVERY LIVING BEING AND
THE PLANET ALONE, LIKE WE ARE...
WE CANNOT BE SO HUMAN CENTRIC
BECAUSE WITHOUT EVERYTHING,
WITHOUT THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM, WE
WILL BE DOOMED SOONER THAN WE
THINK WE WILL BE.
SO I REALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 YAY.
 Jeff: I WILL FIGURE OUT A
WAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE
CHARITY AND THANK YOU FOR ALL
THAT.
AND I'M JUST... I'M SPEECHLESS.
 Jeff: YOU'RE SPEECHLESS.
SO AM I.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS STAY UP HERE.
YOU HUG IT OUT FOR A MINUTE.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: I HAVE TO GO SEE
SOMEBODY DOWN HERE.
THIS IS A BIZARRE TRANSITION TO
MAKE.
BUT IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO CAN
MAKE IT, IT'S DREW CAREY,
BECAUSE...
[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
SO THAT WAS FUNNY.
THAT WAS GREAT.
 I HAVE NO MONEY.
 Jeff: BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE
MONEY.
YOU'RE ALWAYS GIVING AWAY MONEY.
 I LEFT MY WALLET IN THE CAR.
 Jeff: SO HERE'S THE THING.
DREW, YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO
INVITE MYSELF AND SOME OTHER
SURVIVORS TO PLAY IN A PRIME
TIME EDITION OF "THE PRICE IS
RIGHT."
 YEAH.
NOT ONLY YOU GUYS, BUT THE OTHER
REALITY SHOW.
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT, LIKE, YOU
KNOW, IT'S A GAME.
AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD AT
PLAYING GAMES.
IF ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE HAD A
CHANCE THE PLAY CARDS OR A BOARD
GAME WITH PEOPLE FROM
"SURVIVOR," YOU WOULD GO HECK,
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE
THEM PLAY THESE OTHER GAMES.
SO WE THOUGHT, WHY NOT PUT THEM
ON "THE PRICE IS RIGHT," THE
LONGEST-RUNNING TELEVISION GAME
SHOW IN HISTORY.
ON "PRICE IS RIGHT," IT'S ABOUT
FIGURING OUT THE GAME QUICK EVEN
MORE THAN KNOWING THE PRICE OF
THE THING.
 Jeff: WE HAD A BLAST.
 IT WAS REALLY FUN.
IT'S AMAZING TO SEE HOW THEIR
MINDS WORK DOING "PRICE IS
RIGHT" GAMES AS OPPOSED TO THIS.
 IT'S ON THIS MONDAY, MAY
23rd AT 8:00.
 AND IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
 Jeff: HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY.
 THANKS, MAN.
 Jeff: I'M GOING TO WALK
BACK UP HERE BECAUSE THIS IS
WHY... WHERE WE AT?
THIS IS WHY LIVE TELEVISION IS
STILL THE GREATEST THING IN THE
WORLD.
BECAUSE YOU TRULY DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND I'M
NOT EVEN SURE THAT WAS THE RIGHT
TRANSITION.
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD HAVE GONE
TO DREW.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO
COMMERCIAL, DREW, AND THEN COME
OUT FRESH WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS
IS PRETTY BEAUTIFUL.
BUT YOU'RE SO COOL TO HAVE US
ON.
I WAS TORN.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
MY SHOES WENT THIS WAY.
MY BRAIN WENT THAT WAY, BUT I
WANT TO END BACK OVER HERE WITH
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN
"SURVIVOR."
UP NEXT, IT WAS A VERY SCARY
MOMENT.
THREE SURVIVORS WENT DOWN.
WE'LL GET AN UPDATE ON THE
EVACUATION.
MORE RIGHT AFTER THIS.
 OH, THERE IT IS.
 THE SEASON OF "SURVIVOR,"
IT'S TOUGH.
 I FELT MY BODY SHUTTING DOWN.
 HOW YOU FEELING, DEB?
 I HAVE HEAT STROKE.
 THE HEAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE
BIGGEST FACTORS IN THIS GAME.
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN
EVACUATION.
 THEN THERE'S SOMETHING EVEN
GROCER ON MY BACK.
 IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL OUT
HERE.
 THEY'RE PULLING ME FROM THE
GAME.
 Jeff: YOU ARE PULLING JOE
FROM THE GAME?
THIS IS THE MOST EVACUATIONS IN
ANY SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, THAT WAS THE MOST
FRIGHTENED THAT I'VE BEEN ON ANY
DAY ON "SURVIVOR."
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL
AND DRAMATIC EPISODES WE'VE EVER
DONE.
CALEB, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE 100%
NOW, RIGHT?
 YES.
 Jeff: WALK ME THROUGH WHAT
YOU REMEMBER.
 PRETTY MUCH I REMEMBER THE
WHOLE CHALLENGE UP UNTIL I
ROLLED THE BALL, MADE THE
GAME-WINNING SHOT AND THAT BIG
RELIEF WAS JUST LIKE, THANK GOD,
WE GOT SALT AND PEPPER, YOU
KNOW, THAT KIND OF WENT THROUGH
MY MIND.
AND AS I FELL TO THE SAND,
EVERYTHING JUST STARTED GETTING
A LITTLE DIZZY.
I LOOKED UP AND THE TREES LOOKED
LIKE THEY WERE SPINNING, AND I
THOUGHT, I NEED SHADE LIKE RIGHT
NOW.
PLUS I WAS IN THE HOT SAND
ANYWAY.
I WALKED OVER TO THE SAND AND I
COLLAPSED AND THAT WAS IT.
 Jeff: THAT'S ALL YOU
REMEMBER?
BECAUSE YOU WERE DOWN FOR 20
MINUTES WHILE DR. JOE WORKED ON
YOU.
AND NICK HELD YOU AND JASON WAS
HOLDING CYDNEY.
IT WAS COMPLETE CHAOS.
 I VAGUELY REMEMBER OPENING MY
EYES SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,
AND I SEEN YOUR FACE ABOVE ME,
AND YOU SAID THAT I WAS IN GOOD
HANDS, AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I WAKE UP ON A HELICOPTER.
 Jeff: WELL, IT WAS... OKAY.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
SO THEN WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING
WITH YOUR FAMILY AND AT THE TIME
YOUR GIRL... YOU'RE MARRIED NOW,
RIGHT?
 YES.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS, BUT
CALEB, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
MUST BE INTERESTING IS YOU CAN'T
PREP THEM BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO
SEE.
 NO.
OF COURSE I GOT THE CALL.
MOM, I'M IN THE HOSPITAL.
I HAD A HEAT STROKE.
THAT'S REALLY ALL I KNOW.
I WOKE UP WITH A MASK ON AND
I.V.s.
 Jeff: WAS THAT EMOTIONAL
FOR YOU FAMILY?
 IT WAS DIFFERENT.
MY MOM, I DON'T THINK SHE'S...
OR MY FAMILY, THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
ME IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION.
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ME
GASPING FOR IT SEEMED LIKE MY
LAST COUPLE BREATHS IT LOOKED
LIKE I WAS TAKING.
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.
FOR ME, I'M A TOUGH KID, I LOOK
OVER AND MY MOM IS JUST BALL.
AND WHEN YOUR A MAMA'S BOY, SHE
CRIES, YOU CRY.
SO I LOOK OVER, THE WHOLE ROOM
WAS EMOTIONAL, AND IT WAS TOUGH
BECAUSE AGAIN YOU'RE RIGHT, I
HAD NO CLUE WHAT I LOOKED LIKE,
BUT I LOOKED A HOT MESS.
 Jeff: YOU LOOKED LIKE A
STUD PLAYING A HARD GAME.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU GUYS TO
SOMEBODY BECAUSE HERE'S THE
THING ON "SURVIVOR" THAT I WANT
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND.
WE ARE PREPARED FOR SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS.
WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TEAM AND THEY ARE ALWAYS HERE.
THEY'RE AT EVERY CHALLENGE.
THEY'RE AT EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WE HAVE SAFETY SWIMMERS IN THE
WATER WHEN WE'RE IN THE WATER,
AND THE GUY WHO HEADS EVERYTHING
UP, DR. JOE ROWLES, WE CALL HIM
"SURVIVOR" DR. JOE.
SO JUST TO GIVE SOME
PERSPECTIVE, HOW SERIOUS WAS
THAT DAY?
 I THINK WITHOUT A DOUBT CALEB
WAS THE SICKEST PERSON WE EVER
HAD TO LOOK AT ON "SURVIVOR."
I THINK YOU COULD SEE AT ONE
POINT WE WERE QUITE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.
 Jeff: AND WE'VE DONE THIS
FOR A WHILE.
URGELY YOU'RE VERY TALKATIVE AND
VERY GOOD AT EXPLAINING THINGS.
YOU WERE NOT TALKING.
YOU WERE ASKING FOR I.V.s AND
ICE.
 IT'S ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN
THE SHOW WENT OUT THE WINDOW.
I THINK YOU COULD TELL THAT WHEN
I STOPPED TALKING AND HE WAS
WORKING WITH ME.
WE HAD TO CONCENTRATE 100% ON
CALEB REALLY.
 Jeff: ONE OF THE
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS
JOB IS YOU HAVE THIS WEIRD THING
WHERE YOU CAN'T HELP PEOPLE MOST
OF THE TIME.
IF IT'S A SCAB OR INFECTION, YOU
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LIFE AND
LIMB, YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS
CALL.
AND BEING AN ADVENTURE GUY
YOURSELF, WHAT'S IT LIKE, FOR
INSTANCE WITH NEAL AND JOE, YOU
HAD TO PULL THEM FROM THIS
ADVENTURE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
WE KNOW HOW HARD THESE GUYS WORK
TO GET WHERE THEY ARE.
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS
TAKE ANYONE OUT OF THE GAME.
WE DON'T DO IT LIGHTLY.
THE MINOR THINGS, CUTS, SCRAPE,
ABRASIONS, THESE GUYS HAVE TO
DEAL WITH IT THEMSELVES BACK AT
CAMP.
BUT OCCASIONALLY WE WILL HAVE TO
STEP IN IF WE FEEL THERE'S A
THREAT TO SOMEONE'S LONG-TERM
HEALTH, THEIR LIFE OR LIMB.
 Jeff: HOW HARD IS THAT FOR
YOU JUST AS A GUY INTO
ADVENTURE?
BECAUSE I FEEL YOU HAVE AN
EMPATHY WITH THEM.
 I LOVE WATCHING THEM PLAY AND
HOW MUCH EFFORT THEY PUT IN.
I FEEL TERRIBLE WHEN YOU TELL
SOMEONE, THAT'S IT.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE
GAME.
CALEB WOULDN'T HAVE COME OUT OF
THE GAME IF I'D HAVE GIVEN HIM A
CHOICE.
IF HE WAS CONSCIOUS, HE WOULD
HAVE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME
OUT, I'M SURE.
 Jeff: IT WAS MAYBE THE
BIGGEST MOVE OF THE GAME WHEN
THE SUPERIDOL CAME INTO PLAY AND
TAI SAID.
NO WE'LL TALK TO JASON, SCOT AND
TAI ABOUT THAT NIGHT.
BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: WELL, SOCIAL MEDIA
WAS ON FIRE, MUCH LIKE IT
PROBABLY IS RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE
SIA MOMENT, THE NIGHT TAI TURNED
ON HIS ALLIANCE AND DENIED JASON
AND SCOT THE IDOL.
SO TAI, JUST QUICKLY WALK ME
THROUGH IT.
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO GO ALONG WITH
THE SUPERIDOL?
 I ACTUALLY DECIDED I'M NOT
GOING TO IM -- GO WITH THE SUPER
IDOL THE NIGHT BEFORE.
 Jeff: SO YOU KNEW YOU WERE
GOING TO MAKE A MOVE?
 YES, IT WAS STILL VERY
DIFFICULT TO STAND UP WITH TWO
GUYS NEXT TO ME, LIKE TWO BIG
GIANT GUYS.
 Jeff: YEAH.
 AND I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT AND TALKED TO AUBRY
ABOUT IT.
I SAID, I'M LOSING MY VOICE.
I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS
ALLIANCE.
I CANNOT CONTROL THESE BIG GIANT
BEASTS WITH TWO HEADS.
I HAVE TO CUT OFF ONE.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR JASON
AND HE WON IMMUNITY.
I TALKED TO AUBRY.
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
THIS GIRL I NEVER CONNECTED
WITH, I JUST FEEL LIKE HOME.
SO I DID.
SO I WENT IN THERE KNOWING I'M
GOING TO DO IT.
 Jeff: GOT IT AND WE'RE
LIVE.
JASON, I THINK I KNOW THE
ANSWER, BUT EVERYBODY IS ASKING,
WHY GIVE SCOT THE IDOL
BEFOREHAND, BECAUSE THE SUPER
IDOL IS SUPER COOL AND YOU COULD
MAKE THE MOVE AFTER THE VOTE?
 IT WAS TO MAKE SCOT FEEL AS
SECURE AS I FELT.
I HAVE A NECKLACE.
I'M NOT GOING HOME.
WE THOUGHT TAI WAS WITH US.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING.
WHY LET MY FRIEND HANG OUT TO
DRY.
 Jeff: BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
TO FIND PEOPLE TO TRUST EVEN
THOUGH TRUST IS THE MOST ELUSIVE
THING IN THE GAME.
I GUESS THAT'S WHEN TAI LOST
YOUR VOTE NEW YORK THAT MOMENT.
 YOU CAN SAY THAT.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, I GOT TO
SAY...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL, YOU'RE
UP THERE WITH RUPERT AND COACH
AND PHILIP, ONE OF THE MOST
ENTERTAINING PLAYERS EVER, AND
THE BIG QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU,
DID YOU FEEL THE ARC?
BECAUSE WHEN THE SHOW STARTED,
PEOPLE WERE LIKE SAYING THINGS
LIKE, DEBBIE, SHE'S A NUT.
AND BY THE TIME YOU WERE OUT,
PEOPLE WERE GOING, OH, MAN, I
THOUGHT SHE HAD A SHOT TO WIN.
 WELL, SANITY IS OVERRATED
FIRST OF ALL, SO ME AND MY
MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES REALLY
LIKE THE WORLD WE INHABIT.
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY DID STUPID
THINGS.
EVERYBODY DID SMART THINGS.
EVERYBODY WAS WEAK.
EVERYBODY WAS STRONG.
EXCEPT YOU, SCOT.
NO, SCOT WAS SNARLING 95% OF THE
TIME.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, IT'S A SIMPLE
QUESTION, THOUGH, WERE YOU IN ON
THE JOKE IN THAT PEOPLE SEE YOU
AS ODD AT FIRST UNTIL THEY GET
TO KNOW YOU?
 YES.
I'M ECCENTRIC, NOT ODD.
 Jeff: ECCENTRIC, BETTER
WORD.
QUICKLY NEW YORK 30 SECOND, LIST
ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN THINK OF
YOU'VE DONE.
 TAKING CARE OF HORSES, TAKING
CARE OF NUNS.
TAKING CARE OF MY FAMILY.
CHEMISTRY, MICROELECTRONIC,
COUNTERFEIT DETECTION OF
COMPUTER CHIPS.
U.S. AIR FORCE AUXILIARY.
I HAVE BEEN PAID TO JUGGLE,
MODEL AND ACT.
 MOTORCYCLE RIDING.
 I DON'T GET PAID FOR THAT,
BUT IF YOU WANT THE PAY ME, I
RIDE A HARLEY.
 Jeff: DEBBIE WE LOVE YOU.
 THANK YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
 Jeff: JOE, AND I KNOW I'M
RUSHING A LITTLE BIT, BUT WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
GETTING IT DONE AT 71.
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I MEAN, YOU REALLY ARE... IT'S
EASY TO PICK ON YOU AND SAY YOU
WERE FALLING BEHIND IN
CHALLENGES.
YOU'RE 71 FREAKIN' YEARS OLD.
THE BODY DOES START TO BREAK
DOWN.
WHY "SURVIVOR"?
THERE ARE SO MANY EASIER
ADVENTURES.
 BECAUSE IT WAS AN ADVENTURE.
I SET MY HEART.
YOU GAVE ME A SHOT WITH THESE
WONDERFUL PEOPLE TO DO IT.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: GLAD YOU WERE THERE.
JULIA, AT THE OTHER END OF THE
SPECTRUM, THE YOUNGEST PERSON,
YOU WERE SO YOUNG THAT YOU LIED
AND SAID YOU WERE IN YOUR 20s.
WHAT LIFE LESSON DID YOU LEARN?
 YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WHEN I
WAS ON BRAWN BEACH AND I WAS PUT
BY MYSELF, COMPLETELY ISOLATED,
I WAS IN A REALLY VULNERABLE
PLACE, AND I USED THAT
EXPERIENCE AS A LIFE LESSON TO
BE LIKE, LOOK, LIFE THROWS YOU
THESE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS, AND
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT, AM I
GOING TO LET THIS DRAG ME DOWN
OR AM I GOING TO LET IT FUEL MY
FIRE?
WATCHING IT WAS EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT.
I WAS CRUMBLING AND SEEING
MYSELF SO WEAK WAS REALLY HARD
TO DO.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT FUELED MY
FIRE TO GET ME THROUGH THE REST
OF THE SHOW.
I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE
THE BULL BY THE HORNS BASICALLY
AND JUST GO FOR IT AND USE THOSE
NEGATIVE MOMENTS TO EMPOWER YOU.
 Jeff: NICE.
WELL, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
MARK THE CHICKEN.
FIRST OF ALL, THERE WAS ALSO A
CHICKEN NAMED JEFF THAT THEY
ATE.
I'M JUST SAYING.
BUT MARK THE CHICKEN, IF YOU
DON'T KNOW, CAN WE GO TO A SHOT
OF THE BOOTH?
IT'S ACTUALLY NAMED AFTER MARK
BURNETT.
THERE HE IS, MR. "SURVIVOR."
AND I LOVE THAT THE CHICKEN --
TAI ACTUALLY CONVINCED PEOPLE
NOT TO EAT A CHICKEN ON
"SURVIVOR."
THAT'S CRAZY.
THAT'S WHY SIA CAME UP HERE,
THAT POWER YOU HAD.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS GAME "SURVIVOR," IT'S ABOUT
ADVENTURE.
IT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WE WANTED TO BE THE ADVENTURE OF
A LIFETIME.
IT'S WHY WE SPEND SO MUCH OF THE
YEAR TRYING TO MAKE THIS SHOW
KICK ASS AND FIND COMPELLING
PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND SEEK THIS
ADVENTURE.
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
REDUNDANT, I'M TELLING YOU, WE
HAVE ANOTHER GREAT SEASON, AND
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A SNEAK
PEEK WHEN WE COME BACK.
 Jeff: WELL OUR NEXT SEASON
OF "SURVIVOR" WILL BE OUR 33rd
SEASON.
AND WE ARE STILL SO ENTHUSED
ABOUT THIS SHOW.
WE FOUND THE GREATEST LOCATION,
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE LOCATION IN
FIJI.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL, ISLAND, THOSE
UNDERWATER SHOTS WHERE THE
SURVIVORS JUMP IN.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS SEASON
AND THE THEME IS REALLY COOL.
HERE'S WHAT WE ARE DOING NEXT.
FOR OUR 33rd SEASON,
"SURVIVOR" WILL PUT 20 NEW
CASTAWAYS TO THE ULTIMATE TEST
TO MOVE WHICH GENERATION HAS
WHAT IT TAKES TO OUTWIT, OUTPLAY
AND OUTLAST.
IT'S "SURVIVOR" MILLENNIALS
VERSUS GEN X.
 IT'S HARD WORK.
IT'S NOT HOW FAST I CAN TYPE IT
ON GOOGLE AND FIND THE ANSWER.
MILLENNIALS DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN.
THEY CERTAINLY HAVEN'T BEEN
BATTLE TESTED.
 IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER BEEN
KNOCKED DOWN, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET UP AND FIGHT.
 I THINK THE OLDER GENERATION
HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED WITH YOU
HAVE TO HAVE A CAREER.
YOU HAVE TO DO A, B, C, D.
I'M A FREE MAN.
I DON'T LIKE TO BE CAGED.
I'M GOING TO GO DO IT.
#FULLSURVIVOR.
 WE'RE CONSTANTLY TOLD, GROW
UP, STOP PLAYING, IT'S NOT A
GAME, BUT THIS IS LIFE.
I PLAY VIDEO GAMES ONLINE FOR A
LIVING.
IT'S A BLESSING AND IT'S BECAUSE
I'M A MILLENNIAL.
 I DON'T FEEL LIKE MOST YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE QUITE AS DRIVEN.
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT
MORE CHE SARA SARA.
IF IT TAKES ME SEVEN YEARS TO
FINISH SCHOOL, WHO CARES?
MY PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR IT.
 THEY'RE ALWAYS ON SOCIAL
MEDIA AND TWITTER.
I GENERALLY RESENT TECHNOLOGY.
I THINK TWITER IS THE WORST
THING INVETTED.
I'M ON TWITTER, BUT I THINK IT'S
HORRENDOUS.
 I MIGHT NOT LOOK IT, BUT I'M
AN OUTDOORSY PERSON.
 THEY THINK WE'RE OLD.
THEY THINK WE DON'T GET IT.
THERE WERE NO PARTICIPATION
AWARDS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,
BUT WHO I AM, I COULD HAVE USED
A DOZEN.
BUT "SURVIVOR" IS ALL ABOUT
EARNING IT, WHEREAS MAYBE
MILLENNIALS FEEL LIKE THEY
DESERVE IT.
 Jeff: THE GREATEST SOCIAL
EXPERIMENT ON TELEVISION
CONTINUES WITH "SURVIVOR:
MILLENNIALS VERSUS GEN X" THIS
FALL ON CBS.
GLEN, GET A BIG SHOT OF OUR
CAST.
IT IS VERY HARD THE TRANSITION
FROM ONE SEASON TO ANOTHER.
IT'S LIKE SEEING YOUR EX WITH
SOMEBODY.
I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU GUYS
WERE AMAZING THIS SEASON.
I THANK YOU FOR DOING
"SURVIVOR."
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
NEXT SEASON.
TAKE A BREAK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT THE TAKE PART IN THE
"SURVIVOR" ADVENTURE, GO TO
IF YOU WANT TO OWN PROPS FROM
THIS GROUP AND THIS SEASON OF
PROCEEDS GO TO SURVIVOR STAND UP
TO CANCER.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOYALTY.
GOOD NIGHT.
