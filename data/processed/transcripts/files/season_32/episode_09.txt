 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"... BRAWN AND BEAUTY
WERE IN THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE
AND TARGETING THE BRAINS.
 PRETTY SET IN STONE THAT THE
PRINCE ALL GO TO GO.
 Jeff: BUT CYDNEY GOT TIRED
OF THE MEN CONTROLLING THE GAME.
 DON'T TELL ME.
IRRITATED CYDNEY WILL BLOW THE
WHOLE GAME UP.








 Jeff: SO SHE RALLIED THE
WOMEN IN ORDER TO TAKE OUT ONE
OF THE MEN.
 WE ALL DOWN TO VOTE THAT WAY?
IF IT BACK FIRES, OH, WELL.
I'LL BE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE A
MOVE IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL...
 WE HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THE
SUPERIDOL, AS WELL.
 Jeff: TAI MADE A BIG
MISTAKE.
 I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW.
 Jeff: BUT FOR CYDNEY,








EVERYTHING FELL ENTER PLACE WHEN
THE WOMEN SENT NICK TO THE JURY.
 Jeff: NICK, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
LEAVING SCOT, JASON AND TAI
WONDERING WHAT TO DO ON THE
BOTTOM.
NINE ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 WELL PLAYED, YOU GUYS.
GIRL POWER, HUH?
 WELL, THE GIRLS PULLED A GOOD
ONE AND BLIND SIDED US
BASICALLY.
CLEARLY THE STATUS OF THE BRAWN
ALLIANCE IS DONE.
IT'S NOW JASON AND I AND TAI.
YEAH, YEAH.
 AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I SAID,
JEFF, THERE'S A SUPER IDOL.
OH, NO, I OPENED MY MOUTH AGAIN.
SO I PANICKED.
AND THEN I VOTED FOR JASON, I
BUT I WAS SO FEARFUL HOW I'M
GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT JASON VOTE
BECAUSE I CAN'T LIE TOO WELL, SO
I SAY, I VOTE FOR DEBBIE.
 WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS
SAVE NICK TONIGHT.
 YOU DO HAVE ONE?
 I HAVE ONE.
 I HAVE ONE, YOU HAVE ONE.
THE SUPERIDOL IS REAL.
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN THEY
TRY AND DO SOMETHING, WE GO,
GUESS WHAT, BITCHES, BOOM.
 THERE'S ONLY THREE OF US, BUT
WE HAVE TWO IDOLS, AND WE CAN
PUT THEM TOGETHER TO FORM A
SUPERIDOL.
 WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT
TAKING AWAY THEIR FOOD?
 YEAH.
 WE DON'T PROVIDE FOR THEM.
 AFTER THEY GO TO BED, FAR,
FAR AWAY.
 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE
MACHETE AND AX AND TAKE AWAY
THEIR ABILITY TO DO THINGS JUST
TO WEAKEN THEIR SOUL A LITTLE.
IT'S LIKE LOGICAL WARFARE.
I DID IT IN THE MILITARY.
I DO IT IN BOUNTY HUNTING.
YOU CUT OFF ALL THEIR TIES, MESS
WITH THEIR MINDS.
KEEP THEM WEAK.
LOOK FOR THE CRACKS, LOOK FOR
THE WEAKNESS, READ BETWEEN THE
LINES, TRY THE STRIKE.
I LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.
 I SAY WE MAKE CAMP LIFE
MISERABLE, NO PROVIDING FOOD.
ARE WE IN AGREEMENT?
 I KNOW THIS IS A GAME, BUT
THE WAY JASON AND SCOT GO AT
THINGS IS SO EXTREME.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TAKING AWAY
ALL THE FOOD, ALL THE STUFF FROM
THE GIRL, THAT MAKES ME
UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT'S NOT HOW I APPROACH LIFE.
IT'S NOT HOW I APPROACH PROBLEM
SOLVING.
AND I'M IN THE PART OF THAT, BUT
I CANNOT CONTROL WHAT THEY DO.
 IT'S TIME THE RAISE HAVOC.
 GOOD MORNING.
 GOOD MORNING.
TIRED?
 NO.
I'VE BEEN THE FIRE STARTER HERE
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
 THE MAIN REASON FOR SABOTAGE
IS TO WEAKEN THEM, BECAUSE IT
COULD CAUSE SOMEBODY TO CRACK,
AND I'M HOPING THAT IT PUSHES
THINGS UP.
SO IT'S TIME THE TRY THE MAKE
LIFE AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE
WE TOOK THE MA SHEDTISM WE TOOK
THE AX.
WE WENT BACK UP IN THE JUNGLE A
LITTLE BIT.
REALLY, NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW?
WE HID THE TOOLS.
THEY'LL NEVER FIND THAT.
CERTAINLY I'M NOT GOING TO JUST
LAY DOWN AND SAY, HEY, GOOD
GAME.
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO RIGHT
NOW IS FIGHT, AND SO WE'RE GOING
TO FIGHT.
AND IF FIGHTING MEANS MAKING
EVERYBODY ELSE MISERABLE IN THE
PROCESS, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
 IF YOU HOLD UP.
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS AN ABSOLUTELY
BEAUTIFUL THING.
THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE
COMPLETELY IN CONTROL FIND IT IT
WAS ALL AN ILLUSION, AND NOW
THEY'RE PISSED OFF, SO THE
FEELING IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THEIR
CHARACTER OF WHAT POOR SPORTSMEN
THEY ACTUALLY ARE.
THEY ARE NOT GENTLEMEN.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE MACHETE
IS?
 IT WAS HERE.
WHO OPENED THE COCONUT LAST
NIGHT?
 THE AX AND MACHETE GONE.
 IN MACHETE IN.
 NO AX.
 WHERE DID THEY GO?
 THIS MORNING, WOKE UP AND ONE
OF THE GIRLS, I THINK MICHELE,
WAS TRYING TO FIND THE MACHETE
AND/OR THE AX, GONE.
 SABOTAGE.
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING
ON.
 THEY WERE TAKEN.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU DON'T GO BACK AND HIDE TOOLS
ESSENTIAL FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE.
 THAT IS SO IMMATURE.
THE BOYS THINK THEY CAN BREAK US
DOWN AND KEEP US DOWN BY DOING
THESE THINGS, BUT WE JUST USE
OUR SMARTS AND FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER WAY.
 WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.
 WE DON'T NEED YOU BIG BURLY
MEN TO DO IT FOR US.
WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT WITH WHAT
WE'VE GOT.
WITHIN 20 MINUTES WE FIGURED OUT
A NEW METHOD.
 IT'S OPENING.
 THANK YOU.
 CAN'T STOP US, CAN'T STOP US!
 IT POPPED RIGHT OPEN.
 SO I'M LISTENING TO THE
LITTLE, OH, WE'RE GOOD, WE GOT.
THIS WE'LL JUST COOK UP COCONUTS
THE OLD WAY AND WE GOING TO BE
FINE.
AND I WAS MAD ALREADY.
 NICE.
 BUT THAT WAS THE TIPPING
POINT.
I WAS LIKE, OKAY, WELL, YOU'RE
BRAGGING AGAIN, AND NOW I'M
STEAMING, SO I'M GOING TO DO
SOMETHING STUPID.
 THAT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG.
 SPECULATION.
 WHY YOU DOING THAT?
 WHY WOULD YOU SABOTAGE THE
FIRE?
WHY WOULD YOU SABOTAGE US?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SABOTAGE
YOU, IT'S THE GAME?
POURING WATER ON THE FIRE IN.
 PART OF THE GAME.
YOU'RE THE FIRE STARTER.
START FIRE.
 YOUR TRUE COLORS COME OUT.
 I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT KIND
OF BEHAVIOR.
I DON'T TOLERATE IT IN MY
REGULAR LIFE, AND I DON'T WANT
TO TOLERATE IT OUT HERE EITHER.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET IT BACK GOING.
SO NATHAN KEEPS THE POWER
STRUGGLE GOING ON, BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING THE BACK DOWN.
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO FIND A
WAY.
 WHEW.
 I KNEW THEY WOULD START IT.
 THAT'S FINE.
WE'LL PUT IT OUT AGAIN.
 WE CAN'T GO TOO EXTREME.
 WHY NOT?
 THEY'RE GOING TO...
 THEY'RE GETTING RID OF US
ANYWAY.
 IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME
THE WATCH THINGS.
I NEED TO HAVE BIGGER PLANS.
 THEY HAD NO PROBLEM THROWING
US UNDER THE BUS LAST NIGHT.
 EXACTLY.
 LET'S THINK OF SOME MORE FUN
STUFF TO DO.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
AUBRY, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CLEARLY A BIG BLIND SIDE.
DID THAT HAVE ANY IMPACT BACK AT
CAMP, OR IS IT JUST STILL GAME
ON?
 I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THE COLD
WAR ENDED AND THERE ARE MISSILES
GOING BACK AND FORTH QUITE
FRANKLY.
 Jeff: MEANING?
 IT IS SABOTAGE BACK AT CAMP.
I AWAKE TO A MISSING HATCHET,
MACHETE AND SCOT PROCEEDS TO
POWER FIVE GALLONS OF WATER ON
OUR FIRE TO EXTINGUISH IT.
 Jeff: SCOT, WHAT'S THE
RATIONALE FOR DUMPING THE WATER?
 I WAS JUST SENDING THE
MESSAGE THAT I'M THE ONE THAT
GOES AND GETZ THE WATER.
THE MANGOES EXIST BECAUSE I
BOOST TAI UP INTO A TREE BECAUSE
HE PICKS THEM.
 I CAN CLIMB A DAMN TREE.
 LET'S SEE IT.
 Jeff: CLEARLY A LOT GOING
ON.
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DIVIDED INTO
TWO TEAMS OF FOUR.
EACH TEAM WILL BE ATTACHED TO
ONE LONG ROPE.
ON MY GO YOU'LL WORK TOGETHER TO
UNBRAID THAT ROPE.
ONCE YOU'RE COMPLETELY
UNSPOOLED, YOU WILL THEN UNCLIP
AND RACE TO USE SANDBAGS TO
KNOCK A SERIES OF BLOCKS OFF THE
LEDGE.
FIRST TEAM TO GET ALL THEIR
BLOCKS COMPLETELY OFF THE LEDGE
WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 THIS IS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT BACK
HOME -- CHINESE TAKE-OUT
DELIVERED TO CAMP.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, GOD.
 Jeff: QUESTION.
WE WERE GOING TO THIS A
SCHOOLYARD PICK, BUT IF YOU CAN
ALL AGREE TO PICK YOUR OWN TEAM,
DO IT RIGHT NOW, OTHERWISE WE'LL
DRAW, WITH ONE CAVEAT.
ONE PERSON WILL BE LEFT OUT.
THE PERSON WHO DOESN'T RUN WILL
GET THE CHANCE TO PICK WHO YOU
THINK IS GOING TO WIN, AND IF
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU CELEBRATE WITH
THEM.
IF NOT YOU CELEBRATE WITH THE
LOSERS.
 I'M SITTING OUT.
 YOU'RE SITTING OUT?
 YEP.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THAT MAKES IT EASY.
NOW WE HAVE EIGHT PEOPLE.
ARE THERE TWO FOURSOMES WHO WANT
TO RUN?
WE HAVE ANIMOSITY.
LET'S GET IT OUT.
 ONE OF THE GIRLS WANT TO COME
WITH US?
 WE HAVE TAI, JASON AND SCOT
LOOKING FOR A GIRL.
 I'LL GO.
 JULIA SWOOPS OVER THERE AND
SAYS SHE WOULD GO WITH THE GUYS.
PRETTY QUICKLY.
AND I WAS LIKE, HOLD UP.
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.
 I DECIDED TO GO WITH THE BOYS
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME, I KNOW THAT KIND OF
PULLING IN SCOT AND PULLING IN
JASON COULD BE REALLY SUPER
BENEFICIAL TO ME.
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO START MAKING
MOVES AND PLAYING MY GAME.
 Jeff: JULIA IS GOING TO
JOIN TAI, JASON AND SCOT.
THAT LEAVES MICHELE, CYDNEY,
AUBRY AND DEBBIE.
JOE VOLUNTEERED TO SIT OUT.
JOE, WHICH TEAM ARE YOU GOING TO
BACK?
 I'LL GO WITH THE GIRLS.
 YES'S GOING TO GO WITH THE
GIRLS.
THIS WAS EASY.
PICK A SPOT.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
 ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT GETTING ALONG, THERE
COULDN'T BE A BETTER CHALLENGE.
 UNDER OR OVER?
 Jeff: THERE'S A LOT OF
ROPE.
THE BETTER YOU COMMUNICATE, THE
FASTER YOU'LL BE FREE, AND YOU
CAN START THROWING YOUR
SANDBAGS.
 I'M COMING OVER.
 Jeff: WOMEN DOING A NICE
JOB.
 COME ON, GIRLS.
 Jeff: STOP, STOP.
JASON AND TAI HUNG UP NOW.
YOU GET HUNG UP, IT WILL SET YOU
BACK QUICKLY.
 I CAN'T GO UNDER.
I'M KNOTTED.
OVER?
 Jeff: YELLOW STARTING TO
PICK IT UP NOW.
 NOW I'M OVER.
 Jeff: JULIA OPTED TO GO
WITH THE MEN.
SO FAR IT'S WORKING.
 I'M OVER.
 Jeff: THE WOMEN ARE SLOWING
DOWN.
AUBRY, MICHELE, CYDNEY, DEBBIE
ALL TANGLED UP.
SCOT, JASON, TAI AND JULIA
GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE END.
 THAT'S IT.
 Jeff: NOW YOU GOT TO GO UP
AND OVER.
GET YOURSELF UNTANGLED.
 GO, GO, GO, GO GO,!
 THE WOMEN ARE NOW UNTIED.
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO THROW
THEMSELVES OVER AND FREE THEIR
ROPE.
JULIA'S FREE.
YOU'RE GOOD.
START THROWING SAND BAGS.
TAI, SCOT, JASON AND JULIA.
GOT TO KNOCK ALL THESE BLOCKS
COMPLETELY OFF THE LEDGE.
AUBRY THE LAST WOMAN, SHE'S GOT
TO GET UP AND OVER.
YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY ROPE ON THE
TOP OF THAT LOG.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Meaghan: EXCELLENT.
COME ON, GIRL.
 Jeff: THE WOMEN ARE GOOD.
UNCLIP.
GO!
THE WOMEN HAVE TO PICK IT UP.
JASON CONTINUES TO FIRE.
CYDNEY KNOCKS ONE OFF.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN
THAT FOR THE WOMEN TO CATCH UP.
JASON EXHAUSTED.
HERE COMES SCOT.
THAT'S A BIG GUN THROWING.
SCOT WITH A HUGE HIT.
 WHO CAN THROW HARD?
 Jeff: CYDNEY MISSES AGAIN.
HERE COMES DEBBIE.
DEBBIE KNOCKS TWO MORE OFF.
DEBBIE KNOCKS THREE MORE OFF.
 BEAUTIFUL.
 Jeff: DEBBIE KNOCKS ANOTHER
OFF.
THE WOMEN ARE STARTING TO CATCH
UP NOW.
 BEAUTIFUL!
 Jeff: DEBBIE'S GOT AN ARM
ON HER.
DEBBIE KNOCKS OFF TWO MORE.
SCOT NOW TRYING TO GO DELICATE.
YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THIS LEDGE.
THESE ARE ALL STILL GOOD.
SCOT KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER.
ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE A
BACK-AND-FORTH CHALLENGE.
DEBBIE KNOCKS OFF TWO.
DEBBIE KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER.
WE ARE VERY CLOSE.
SCOT KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER.
DOWN TO THREE FOR THE MEN.
 YEAH, BUDDY.
NO MAKE IT TWO FOR THE MEN.
IT'S DOWN TO SIX FOR THE WOMEN.
MAKE IT FIVE FOR THE WOMEN.
JASON DOWN TO HIS LAST ONE.
ONE MORE SHOT BY JASON AND IT'S
OVER.
 THROW STRIKES.
THROW STRIKES!
THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS!
 Jeff: JASON, SCOT, TAI AND
JULIA WIN REWARD.
HUGE EFFORT.
ALL RIGHT.
HUGE EFFORT.
NECK AND NECK ONCE AGAIN WITH
TEAMS YOU CHOSE.
JASON, SCOT, TAI, JULIA, NICE
REWARD WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP.
CHINESE TAKE-OUT WILL BE
DELIVERED.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY.
CYDNEY, MICHELE, AUBRY, JOE, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 JULIA AND THE BOYS WON THE
REWARD CHALLENGE, AND SOON AS I
SAW SHE WENT OVER TO THE BOYS, I
KNEW SHE WAS TRYING TO GET A
BETTER POSITION FOR HERSELF.
SHE'S PLAYING BOTH SIDES, BUT I
SEE RIGHT THROUGH JULIA.
I CAN'T TRUST HER AS FAR AS I
CAN THROW HER.
ENJOY.
 THANK YOU.
 I AM GLAD, TAI, YOU GET YOUR
NOODLES.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
 AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE WE WON.
IT CHANGES ON THE FLIP OF A
DIME.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS GAME SO
WONDERFUL.
 NOODLES THE WHOLE TIME.
WE'RE BACK ON THE UPSWING RIGHT
NOW.
WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THAT
MOUNTAIN, BUT JULIA'S GOT US
CHUGGING BACK UP IT.
WE GOT A PRAYER.
 NOODLES.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 JULIA, TAI, MYSELF, JASON AND
MARK THE CHICKEN, WE ATE CHINESE
FOOD AND HAD A COUPLE BEERS.
EVERYTHING WAS REALLY, REALLY
GOOD.
THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS
GETTING A CHANCE TO TALK TO
JULIA AND PICK HER BRAIN.
 IF YOU COULD HAVE YOUR WAY,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
AND IT'S OKAY IF WE'RE NOT IN
THAT PICTURE, UNDERSTAND.
 NO, YOU ARE IN THAT PICTURE.
 GETTING RID OF YOU GUYS WOULD
BE A DUMB MOVE ON MY PART
BECAUSE THEN I'M GOING TO BE AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE CYDNEY, JOE,
DEBBIE AND AUBRY CHAIN.
 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE THINKING
LONG-TERM.
I DEFINITELY HAVE MY OTHER
ALLIANCE THAT I FEEL CONFIDENT
IN, BUT PICKING PEOPLE LIKE SCOT
AND JASON TO THE END WHO HAVE
BETRAYED PEOPLE, WHO HAVE CAUSED
CHAOS AROUND CAMP MIGHT BE A
GOOD IDEA, BECAUSE AT THIS POINT
ANYONE ON THE JURY WOULD NOT
VOTE FOR THEM.
 I THINK YOU SHOULD THINK OF
WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU.
 NO MATTER WHAT, PLEASE
COMMUNICATE WITH US.
 I'M GOING TO FROM NOW ON.
 WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN
IT'S JUST THE FIVE OF US, IT'S
GOING TO BE SPECTACULAR.
 YOU'RE DONE ALREADY?
 UH-HUH.
 I THINK SHE'S LOST TO THE
DARK SIDE.
 SHE'S REALLY SMART.
SHE'S JUST PLAYING THEM I THINK.
 WE'LL SEE.
 SOME PEOPLE THINK JULIA IS
PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE,
BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE IOTA OF
CONCERN ABOUT JULIA FLIPPING ON
US.
 THEY TRY TO SUCK YOU IN?
 LITTLE BIT.
 THERE'S IN WAY.
THERE'S NO WAY.
 TOMORROW I HOPE IT'S SCOT.
I DON'T THINK JASON'S THE BRAIN.
I THINK SCOT IS.
 IS THAT WHAT WE'RE... WE'RE
GOING TO SPLIT?
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHO WINS
AND THEN TALK?
 OKAY.
 MY B.S. RADAR WAS GOING LIKE
THIS WHEN JULIA WAS TALKING TO
MISS DEBBIE.
YOU THINK IT'S STRATEGIC FOR YOU
TO COME FROM THIS GROUP AND COME
FIRST QUESTION, WHAT IS OUR
STRATEGY FOR NEXT TRIBAL?
I DON'T TRUST IT.
SHE THINKS SHE'S SLICK.
YOU CAN'T SLICK A SLICKER IN ANY
DIRECTION.
 WHAT I'M THINKING, WE SPLIT
AND DO JULIA, BOOM.
 THOSE ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS
PLAYERS IN THE GAME.
BACK AND FORTH.
 SHE'S LOGICAL AND SHE'S
SOCIALLY SMART.
 JULIA ISN'T SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO HAVE ALLIANCES.
SHE WANTS TO RIDE THE MIDDLE TO
THE END.
SHE'S PLAYING BOTH SIDES, BUT
SOMETIMES THE GUY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROAD GETS RUN OVER.
AND I HOPE IT'S HER.
NIGHT.
I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
COMMITTED TO THE BOYS.
I WAS UPSET WHEN SCOT PUT OUT
THAT BIG FIRE.
BUT IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO
STEP BACK FROM WHAT I'M FEELING
COMPASSIONATE.
I LIKE THEM, BUT IF THIS IS WAR,
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE OTHER
SIDE UNCOMFORTABLE.
SO I DECIDED TO PUT OUT THE
FIRE.
RIGHT NOW IT'S THEM AND US.
THE EVIL INSIDE ME RARELY COME
OUT, BUT IT DOES.
 TOTALLY OUT?
 YEAH.
 MAYBE MORE WATER WAS POURED
ON IT.
 GOOD MORNING.
 ANY EMBER?
 DEAD.
 THERE'S A PART OF THE
SABOTAGE THAT IS CERTAINLY
CHILDISH, BUT SCOT AND JASON
WERE BEING DELIBERATE TODAY.
THAT WAS TO THROW US OFF THE
SCENT, TO AIM VOTES AT THEM
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE
IDOLS.
MY GUT TELLS ME WITH A BIG
BLINKING SIGN THAT JULIA HAS TO
GO.
 SCOT REALLY PUTS ME OFF WITH
THE FIRE TODAY.
 OKAY.
 HE'S NOW MESSING WITH US
ACTUALLY EATING.
 YES.
 AND SURVIVING.
 YES.
 AND I WANT HIM GONE.
 OKAY.
CAN I SAY WHAT MY GUT IS?
 THERE'S IN WAY SCOT DID THAT
OUT OF A TEMPER.
HE'S A SMART ENOUGH GUY THAT HE
DID IT DELIBERATE LIMP HE'S
TRYING TO SHAKE IT UP SO WE GO
FOR HIM AND JASON RIGHT NOW.
I TRULY FEEL, DEB, THAT WE MIGHT
FLUSH ALL THE IDOLS IN THE GAME
IF WE VOTE FOR JULIA.
 OKAY.
HERE'S THE DEAL.
WE GOT TO GET RID OF THE GUYS
FIRST.
 IT'S KILLING ME THAT DEBBIE
IS GOING WITH HER EMOTION RIGHT
NOW.
SCOT POURED THAT WATER ON THE
FIRE BECAUSE HE WANTED A
REACTION.
AND I WANT TO TELL DEBBIE,
YOU'RE BEING EMOTIONAL, BUT YOU
HAVE TO BE LOGICAL RIGHT NOW.
 MY GUT, AND I RESPECT YOU
GUT, IS SCOT OR JASON HAS TO GO.
 BUT I'M ASKING YOU THAT IF
IT'S THE LOWEST-RISK MOVE AND
ALL THE IDOLS...
 I'M NOT VOTING FOR JEWELA.
I'M NOT.
 DEB IS PUTTING HER FOOT DOWN,
AND I HAVE GONE WITH HER ON A
LOT OF THINGS, BUT I BELIEVE
FIRMLY THAT JULIA NEEDS TO GO
HOME.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAI, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING THE STACK A SERIES OF
BOSTON CELTICS ON A BEAM WHILE
ATTEMPTING TO AVOID TRIP
OBSTACLES.
IF YOU HIT THE OBSTACLE, YOUR
BLOCKS WILL FALL AND YOU'LL HAVE
TO RESTACK.
YOUR GOAL IS TO STACK YOUR
BLOCKS SO THEY FALL LIKE
DOMINOES, ULTIMATELY HITTING A
GONG.
FIRST PERSON TO HIT THEIR GONG
WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ONE IN EIGHT SHOT AT WINNING
THIS GAME.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND
BECOME THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
ONE BLOCK AT A TIME.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE INSIDE WITH
BOTH FEET BEFORE YOU PLACE YOUR
FIRST ONE.
THIS IS SPEED VERSUS PRECISION.
THE FASTER YOU GO, THE MORE
RISKS YOU TAKE.
YOU ARE LOOKING TO SPACE THESE
SO THEY FALL LIKE DOMINO, NOT
TOO CLOSE, NOT TOO FAR APART,
JUST RIGHT.
TAI DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.
EVERY TIME YOU DROP A BLOCK, YOU
GO TO GO BACK AND COME BACK INTO
THE OBSTACLE.
MICHELE NOW WITH THE EARLY LEAD.
JASON RIGHT THERE WITH HER.
AUBRY IN IT.
SCOT TRYING TO GET IN THIS.
JOE AND CYDNEY FALLING OUT OF
THIS.
JULIA SLOW AND STEADY.
JASON LOSES EVERYTHING.
FIRST TO HAVE A TOTAL DISASTER.
JASON NOW STARTING OVER.
SCOT LOSES EVERYTHING.
 YOU GOT IT, MICHELE.
GOOD JOB, GIRL.
 Jeff: GIVING MICHELE A NICE
OPENING TOWARD THAT END.
TAI NOW GAINING ON MICHELE.
IT'S NOW COMING DOWN THE TAI.
CAN TAI CATCH MICHELE?
TAI LOSES EVERYTHING.
HE'S OUT NOW.
IT IS NOW MICHELE, DEBBIE AND
AUBRY VERY CLOSE.
 ME AND YOU, SWEETHEART.
 Jeff: JULIA HAS BEEN SLOW
AND STEADY THIS ENTIRE CHALLENGE
WITH A CHANCE TO WIN IT.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DOUBLE
TIME IT OR HOPE THAT MICHELE
DROPS.
AUBRY RACING.
AUBRY MAKES A BIG MOVE AND LOSES
EVERYTHING.
IT IS NOW MICHELE, DEBBIE AND
JULIA.
CYDNEY LOSES EVERYTHING.
CYDNEY COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.
MICHELE COMING BACK WITH WHAT
COULD BE HER LAST BLOCK.
 GOOD JOB, MICHELE.
 Jeff: JULIA AND DEBBIE THE
ONLY ONES WITH A SHOT AT
CATCHING HER RIGHT NOW.
THIS COULD BE IT.
 YOU KNOCK 'EM DOWN, GIRL.
YOU CAN DO IT.
 Jeff: DOES SHE HAVE THEM
SPACED RIGHT?
 YOU GOT IT, GIRL.
 Jeff: HERE SHE GOES FOR THE
WIN.
SHE'S GOOD SO FAR.
BUT, NO, MICHELE CAN'T DO IT.
MICHELE HAS TO RESET NEARLY
EVERYTHING, OPENING THE DOOR FOR
DEBBIE AND JULIA.
AND JULIA LOSES BLOCKS NOW.
IT'S DEBBIE TO WIN.
 COME ON, DEBBIE.
 SHE COULD WIN IT WITH THIS
BLOCK.
JASON NOT WAITING TO FIND OUT.
HE'S STILL WORKING ON IT, ONE
BLOCK AT A TIME.
DEBBIE GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT
FOR THE WIN.
HERE SHE GOES.
NO!
DEBBIE FALLS SHORT.
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO RESTACK.
THE DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.
NOW IT IS JULIA TRYING TO
RESTACK HER MISSING BLOCKS.
 LET'S GO, JEWELS.
 Jeff: SUDDENLY SCOT AND
JASON ARE BACK IN THIS OUT OF
NOWHERE.
JASON LOST EVERYTHING EARLY IN
THIS CHALLENGE, BUT HE DID NOT
GIVE UP.
HE KEPT FIGHTING, AND HE IS IN
IT.
JULIA HUSTLING TO RESTACK.
SHE'S STILL GOT A SHOT.
SCOT DROPS EVERYTHING AGAIN.
JASON IS TAKING THE TIME TO
RESTACK FROM THE BACK TO THE
FRONT TO TRY TO SHORTEN THE
DISTANCE, BUT HE IS GIVING JULIA
A CHANCE TO GET BACK IN IT.
IT'S A RISKY MOVE.
 COME ON, GIRL.
 Jeff: BUT HE'S COMMITTED.
JULIA PLACES ANOTHER BLOCK.
SHE LOOKS TO BE JUST ONE AWAY.
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE
WIRE.
DEBBIE NOW RESTACKING.
SHE'S NOT GIVING UP.
JASON HAS RESTACKED EVERYTHING.
WILL IT WORK?
IT WAS A BIG MOVE.
JASON FOR THE WIN.
NO!
JASON CAN'T DO IT.
DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.
JULIA PLACES HER LAST BLOCK.
MICHELE GAINING ON HER, JUST A
COUPLE BLOCKS SHORT.
 I'M GOING, FOLKS.
 DEBBIE OUT OF NOWHERE HAS GOT
HERS RESTACKED.
DEBBIE NOW GOING TO GO FOR IT.
NO, DEBBIE FALLS SHORT.
JULIA FOR THE WIN.
AND SHE DOES IT!
JULIA WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 GOOD JOB, JULIA.
THAT WAS AWESOME.
 Jeff: JULIA, COME ON OVER.
YOUNGEST PERSON IN THIS GAME AND
STILL GOING STRONG.
GUARANTEED A ONE IN EIGHT SHOT
AT WINNING THIS GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 24
DAY, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
TONIGHT, AND BECOME THE THIRD
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: THE WORST POSSIBLE
THING HAPPENED.
JULIA WON.
AND MY WHOLE PLAN THAT I WAS
POSITIVE OF WENT OUT THE WINDOW.
JUST OUT THE WINDOW.
WHAT DO I DO NOW?
 GOOD JOB.
HEY, THE TRICK WAS TO USE THEM
ALL.
YOU USED ALL OF THEM.
GOOD GIRL.
 I MISSED ONE OF MINE.
 ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING THE
TALK QUICKLY.
I JUST WANT TO THROW IT OUT
WHILE EVERYBODY IS HERE.
OKAY.
I SAY THAT WE SPLIT THE VOTE
BETWEEN TAI AND SCOT.
JASON WILL EXPECT IT TO BE HIM.
THERE IS NO WAY THE THREE OF
THEM HAVE AN IDOL.
IF IT GOES 3-3-3, WE REVOTE FOR
SCOT?
 OH, NO.
DEB SAYS THIS IS THE PLAN RIGHT
IN FRONT OF JULIA.
AND THAT REALLY SCARES ME.
 FOR THIS TO GO OFF
BEAUTIFULLY, EVERYBODY HAS TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE.
YOU, ME AND JOE ARE GOING TO
VOTE SCOTT.
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE TAI.
 IN THIS SCENARIO, THE VOTE
WOULD BE THREE FOR SCOT, THREE
FOR TAI AND THREE THAT THE BOYS
DECIDED.
 I'LL GO GET TAI.
 BUT JULIA'S BEEN PLAYING
DOUBLE AGENT PRETTY WELL, AND IF
ONE PERSON GOES AWRY, THE WHOLE
THING BLOWS UP AND SOMEONE YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME TOTALLY
GONE.
 DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT THEIR PLAN IS RIGHT NOW?
 WHAT IS IT?
 THEY'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE
BETWEEN YOU AND TAI.
 SO WE'LL VOTE CYDNEY AND
THAT'S THE END OF IT.
 IF JULIA DECIDES TO BE OUR
GUARDIAN ANGEL, AND HOPEFULLY
SHE VOTES CYDNEY, IT WILL GO
4-2-3, AND CYDNEY GOES HOME.
BUT IF JULIA DECIDES TO GO WITH
THE GROUP SHE'S WITH, WE'RE
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS, WE'RE
SAYING WE HAVE IDOL, WE'RE
PULLING OUT EVERYTHING WE CAN
THINK OF TO MAKE SURE WE STICK
AROUND, WE DON'T HAVE AN OPTION.
 OKAY.
SO DEBBIE IS GIVING INFORMATION,
DON'T TELL JULIA ANYTHING.
 I INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT
HER.
DEBBIE ISN'T LISTENING TO ANY
LOGIC.
SHE COMPLETELY TRUSTS JEWELBACK
AND THIS FAR INTO SURVIVOR, I
NEED SOMEONE WHO IS LOGICAL AND
I KNOW IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE
COURSE.
 DO I HAVE TO LIKE CUT DEBBIE
LOOSE IS HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW?
 YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT
AGAINST IT?
 I DON'T THINK THAT JOE WOULD
BE AGAINST IT.
 THIS IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT
FOR ME.
I DON'T WANT DEBBIE TO GO, BUT
WHEN PEOPLE SHOW ME WHO THEY
ARE, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO GO
WITH.
 I STILL HAVE MICHELE.
YOU STILL HAVE JOE.
 I DEFINITELY HAVE JOE, AS
LONG AS YOU'RE SURE YOU HAVE
MICHELE.
 I'M GOING TO NEED TO BE SURE.
 AUBRY ANDRY ON THE SAME PAGE
IN TERMS OF DEBBIE WILL TAKE US
ALL DOWN BEFORE JASON AND SCOT
WILL.
WE CAN GET THEM LATER.
 YOU SURE?
 AUBRY CAME TO ME WITH THE
IDEA OF IT JUST BEING ME, YOU,
JOE AND AUBRY VOTE DEBBIE.
 I'M LIKE, DAMN, I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D SEE THIS DAY.
 I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD.
 FOUR OF US ARE GOING DEBBIE.
 CAN I HAVE AN HONEST
CONVERSATION WITH YOU RIGHT NOW?
 YES.
 SO I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
DEBBIE.
SHE'S BEEN SAYING A FEW THINGS
THAT ARE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL.
SHE TRUSTS JULIA.
LIKE WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?
 A FIVE-MINUTE CONVERSATION
WITH SCOT.
SHE WAS PROBLEM TELLING HIM THE
WHOLE PLAN.
 JOE, I THINK WE HAVE TO VOTE
FOR DEBBIE.
 AUBRY SAID, WELL, SHOULD WE
TAKE DEBBIE OUT, BUT THERE'S NO
NEED FOR THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE
SUCH A VIABLE FORCE GOING.
 WE NEED TO STICK WITH DEBBIE.
 I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE NUMBERS
RIGHT NOW.
 DO WE HAVE FOUR?
 I TRUST YOU, CYDNEY.
I TRUST YOU AND YOU VIBE.
 OKAY.
 RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO TALK TO
JULIA AND THAT'S REALLY SCARY,
BECAUSE NOW JULIA, THE PERSON I
WANTED OUT, IS THE PERSON I NEED
RIGHT NOW.
 ARE YOU WITH US?
 YES.
 SHE'S WITH US FOR REAL, FOR
REAL.
 OKAY.
SO FOR REAL, FOR REAL, WE'RE...
OKAY, WE'RE VOLTING FOR DEBBIE.
 AUBRY'S IN?
 YEAH.
 LET'S SHAKE HANDS ON THE
DEBBIE THING AND IT'S HAPPENING.
 IT'S HAPPENING.
 COOL.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE HAVING
MY HANDS IN DIFFERENT ALLIANCES
HAS GIVEN ME A LOT OF POWER.
 WELCOME BACK.
 THANK YOU.
 I HAVE THE POWER RIGHT NOW TO
SEND DEBBIE HOME, AND I HAVE THE
POWER RIGHT NOW TO SEND CYDNEY
HOME.
JASON, SCOT AND TAI REALLY WANT
CYDNEY GONE.
I CONSIDER CYDNEY A HUGE THREAT
BECAUSE SHE KIND OF TALKS TO
EVERYONE.
BUT DEBBIE IS SOMEONE I WANT
GONE EVENTUALLY, SO IT'S KIND OF
WHO I CHOOSE TO VOTE FOR.
 Jeff:
WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NEAL AND NICK VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE REWARD
CHALLENGE WHERE A LOT OF
INFORMATION WAS REVEALED.
DEBBIE, IT'S CLEAR THERE'S A
DIVISION WITHIN THIS TRIBE.
 YEAH.
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER PEOPLE
TEAMING OFF INTO SUCH TWO
DISTINCT CAMP, AND THIS HAS BEEN
REALLY TOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
EATING.
WE DON'T HAVE A HATCHET OR A
MACHETE, SO OUR VERY LIVES, NOT
OUR FIGURATIVE LIVES, OUR
LITERAL LIVES ARE ON THE LINE.
 Jeff: AUBRY, IS THIS THE
POINT OF WHAT SCOT, JASON AND
TAI ARE DOING, TO TRY TO CAUSE
SOME CHAOS HERE, MAYBE THE GAME
BREAKS OPEN?
 I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE.
THE WATER ON THE FIRE WAS LIKE
AN EPIC MOMENT, IT WAS LYING
GETTING FAJITAS IN A MEXICAN
RESTAURANT, IT JUST ALL WENT UP.
THAT WAS KIND OF A SYMBOLIC...
 Jeff: JULIA, THERE'S A LOT
GOING ON, AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
TALKED ABOUT THE REWARD
CHALLENGE IN WHICH YOU WENT WITH
TAI, SCOT AND JASON.
WHAT WAS THE REACTION BACK AT
CAMP FROM EVERYBODY ELSE WHEN
THEY SAW YOU VOLUNTEER TO BE
WITH THEM?
 THE ALLIANCE THAT DECIDED TO
BLINDSIDE NICK WAS OKAY WITH ME
GOING WITH TAI, JASON AND SCOT,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE HAD
TO DO IT, AND I VOLUNTEERED.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, YOU'RE
NODDING.
 YEAH, WE'RE COMPLETELY FINE,
AND I'M GLAD THAT SHE GOT A GOOD
MEAL.
SHE DESERVED TO EAT, AND SHE WAS
ACTUALLY BRAVE TO STEP UP TO THE
PLATE AND GO BECAUSE MAYBE
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THIS,
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT.
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WANTED
CHINESE FOOD.
I DID.
 Jeff: MICHELE, THE RESULT
IS BIG MEAL FOR JASON, SCOT,
THAI AND JULIA, AND LOOK WHO IS
WEARING THE NECKLACE TODAY.
 SHE'S SAFE TONIGHT, AND I
THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW WHERE HER ALLEGIANCE
LIES.
SHE CAN SIT COMFORTABLY AND VOTE
BASED ON WHERE SHE WANTS TO GO
AND WHO SHE WANTS TO GO WITH,
AND I THINK I KNOW WHAT SIDE
IT'S GOING TO BE.
 Jeff: TAI, LAST TIME WE
WERE AT TRIBAL, WE TALKED ABOUT
IDOLS.
ARE THEY THERE, IS THERE A SUPER
IDOL, WHAT IS THAT, MAYBE
SOMEBODY'S LYING.
DO YOU THINK IDOLS WILL COME
INTO PLAY?
 BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION,
YEAH, I THINK IDOLS WILL COME
INTO PLAY.
IF THE IDOL EXISTS.
 Jeff: JEFF, WE COULD GO
AHEAD AND JUST TELL EVERYBODY
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
 I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JASON AND
SCOT, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
 WELL, I'VE GOT -- TAI'S GOT
AN IDOL.
TAI'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
TONIGHT.
 HE'S STAYING HERE.
HE'S STAYING RIGHT HERE.
 I DO HAVE AN IDOL.
THAT'S AN IDOL.
 I CAN SEE IT?
 YEAH.
 WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT MAIN.
THE IDOL'S GOT A BROTHER.
THERE'S TWO OF THEM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
 WOW.
 Jeff: SO LET ME SEE IF I
GOT THIS.
TAI, YOU'RE SAYING, I HAVE AN
IDOL AND I'M PLAYING IT.
 OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S 6-3.
I'LL PLAY IT.
IT'S 100% OR 30%, AT LEAST 35%.
 Jeff: AND JASON, YOU HAVE
ANOTHER IDOL.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
AND GUESS WHAT, WE'RE ALL GOING
TO GO AND VOTE.
WHEN YOU COME BACK AND SAY, IS
THERE AN IDOL TO BE PLAYED,
WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP, WINNER
GETS THE IDOL TO PLAY, LOSER IS
ON THE BLOCK.
 OH, NO.
 SO I'M GOING TO LET FATE
DECIDE IF I STAY IN THE GAME OR
IF SCOT DOES.
 Jeff: WOW.
AND JASON, CONVERSATIONS
HAPPENING.
 YES, THEY ARE.
 Jeff: HAPPENING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOU.
 THEY'RE SAYING THAT TAI IS
GOING TO SOLIDLY HOLD ON TO THAT
IDOL, BUT TAI COULD GIVE HIS
IDOL UP AND THEN BOTH OF THEM
HAVE THE IDOL, SO IT'S WHERE TO
PLACE OUR SIX VOTES WISELY
BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE
OPPORTUNITY.
 Jeff: IT JUST KEEPS GOING.
JEWELBACK HOW GREAT IS THAT
NECKLACE RIGHT NOW?
 I LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
ARE WE READY TO VOTE?
 ARE WE GOOD?
 ARE WE GOOD?
 YES, WE'RE GOOD.
 YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WITHOUT QUESTION, ONE OF THE
CRAZIEST TRIBALS I HAVE EVER HAD
THE PLEASURE OF WITNESSING.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CYDNEY, YOU'RE UP.
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
ONE SECOND, JEFF.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE IT TO TAI.
LET'S JUST DO THAT.
 WE ARE GIVING MY IDOL TO TAI.
 I ACCEPT YOUR IDOL.
AND I WANT TO SIT DOWN.
 YEP.
 Jeff: OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, THE PERSON
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, SCOT.
CYDNEY.
 SPELLED MY NAME WRONG.
 Jeff: SCOT.
CYDNEY.
TWO VOTES SCOT, TWO VOTES
CYDNEY.
CYDNEY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES CYDNEY.
DEBBIE.
DEBBIE.
THAT'S TWO VOTES DEBBIE.
DEBBIE.
WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES CYDNEY,
THREE VOTES DEBBIE, TWO VOTES
SCOT, ONE VOTE LEFT.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY DEBBIE.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
DEBBIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, RARELY IS THERE A THEME AS
STRONG AS THERE IS ONE THIS
SEASON, NO MATTER HOW BAD IT
SEEM, YOU DON'T MEAN YOU'RE OUT,
AND NO MATTER HOW SAFE YOU FEEL,
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
"SURVIVOR," WITH THE POWER OF
THE SUPER IDOL.
 WE HAVE A SUPER IDOL.
 WE'RE STAYING.
 Jeff: JASON, SCOT AND TAI
FEEL INVINCIBLE.
BUT AUBRY TRIES TO LURE TAI AWAY
FROM THE DARK SIDE.
 TAI'S NOT LIKE JASON AND
SCOT.
THEY'RE DESPICABLE PEOPLE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 THE BIG SURPRISE TO ME HERE
WAS THAT THE GIRLS CHOSE TO GET
RID OF A GIRL.
IT JUST BOGGLES MY MIND AND IT'S
ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO NOW DEFEAT
SCOT, JASON AND TAI.
AND IT TOTALLY STINKS THAT THOSE
THREE WEST WANKERS HAVE MADE IT
FURTHER THAN ME, BUT THEY PLAYED
A BETTER GAME.
