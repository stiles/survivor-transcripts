 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," TAI, JASON AND SCOT
THOUGHT THEY HELD ALL THE POWER.
 NOW WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE.
 Jeff: THEY HAD A MOLE IN
JULIA.
YOU WANT ME TO TELN IS RIGHT NO
 Jeff: AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME. YOU WON YOURSELF AN EXTRA
VOTE.
YEAH.
 Jeff: AND TWO HIDDEN
IMMUNI IDOLS THAT COULD BE
COMBINED TO FORM A SUPER IDOL.
 WHAT' SO GREAT ABOUT THE
SUPER IDOL IS WE CAN PLAY IT
AFTER THE VOTE IS READ.








 Jeff: BUT AUBRY WANTED TO
FLIP THE GAME, AND WENT BEHIND
THE BACKS OF MICHELE AND JULIA
TO TRY TO GET TAI TO TURN ON
JASON AND SCOT.
 YOU HAVE THREE
YOU.
TAS IN
THIS GAME.
 Jeff: LEAVING TAI WITH A
BIG DECISION.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SCOT GOT THE MAJORITY OF THE
VOTES.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, SCOT.
HE LOOKED TO TAI TO GET THE
OTHER HALF OF THE SUPER IDOL,
BUT TAI BETRAYED SCOT AND JASON.
 NO.
 WOW.








 Jeff: SENDING SCOT TO THE
JURY AND TAKING JASON'S IDOL
WITH HIM.
SCOT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING MICHELE AND JULIA OUT OF
THE LOOP AND JASON ALL ALONE.
SEVEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
WE BLIND SIDED SCOT.
IT'S A BIG MOVE, THE LITTLEST
GUY TOOK OUT THE BIGGEST GUY
THIS SEASON.
 THAT WAS EXCELLENT.
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.
 THAT WAS GOOD.
 I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
 I'M HAPPY FOR US.
 I'M SO HAPPY.
 I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
SCOT AND JASON, THOSE TWO GUYS
TALK OVER ME, AND SO THIS IS ME
GETTING CONTROL OF MY OWN GAME.
WE HAVE POWER NOW.
AND I HAVE THE MOST POWER
BECAUSE I HAVE THE IDOL AND THE
EXTRA VOTE.
 THEY'LL NEVER GET RID OF TAI
NOW.
 WHAT?
 THEY'LL NEVER GET RID OF TAI
NOW.
 BEAUTIFUL MOVE, AS A FAN.
BEAUTIFUL MOVE.
BEAUTIFUL.
NICE SEEING YOU ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ALLIANCE.
TAI TURNED.
NEVER SAW IT COMING.
THE ONE AND ONLY THING THAT
COULD GO WRONG WENT WRONG.
TAI MADE A PLAY.
SCOT WAS HOLDING MY IDOL, AND
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, YOU CAN'T
GIVE IT BACK.
IT'S GONE.
I LOST MY PARTNER AND I LOST AN
NOWON THE SCRAMBLE FROM
HERE ON OUT.
I'M AN ISLAND AT THIS POINT.
YOU WANT TO DO SOMEING NUTS,
YOU KNOW I'M THE PERSON TO BE
NUTTY.
 JULIA, YOU SEE IN SHOCK.
 I AM.
LIKE MICHELE, I'M FRUSTRATED
THAT I WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
I VOTED NICK WITH YOU GUYS.
I VOTED DEBBIE WITH YOU GUYS,
AND I VOTED LIKE I SAID I WOULD
TONIGHT.
SO I'M FRUSTRATED, YOU KNOW.
BUT THAT'S FINE.
WHATEVER.
SO I WAS DEFINITELY PLAYING BOTH
SIDES, BUT AUBRY, JOE, TAI AND
CYDNEY FORMED A LITTLE ALLIANCE
THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS AWARE OF
AND VOTED OUT SCOT.
 WANT TO HEAR THE REASON WHY I
VOTE OUT SCOT?
 HONESTLY, I REALLY DON'T
CARE.
 OKAY.
OKAY.
 NOW MICHELE AND I HAVE GONE
DOWN A FEW NOTCHES AFTER
TONIGHT'S VOTE.
 IT IS WHAT IT IS NOW.
 WE'RE ALL DONE.
 WE GOT FOUR.
 DOES JASON HAVE AN IDOL IN.
 NO.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
IDOL.
 I CAN'T STOP SMILING.
WE VOTED OFF SCOT, AND IT FEELS
SO GOOD.
AND THIS CHANGES THE ENTIRE
DYNAMIC OF THE GAME.
 NOW THERE WILL NOT BE A BLIND
SIDE.
WE'LL KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT JASON.
 RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE
NUMBERS, AND JASON DOESN'T HAVE
HIS IDOL ANYMORE.
SO HOPEFULLY JASON LOSES AND WE
CAN GET RID OF HIM AND BE ON OUR
MERRY WAY.
I REMINDING MYSELEF ALL
THE TIME, "SURVIVOR" IS A GAME.
I JUST PULLED A BIG MOVE, BUT
THIS IS FIRST TIME EVER I DID
THIS TO ANYBODY, LIE IN SUCH A
BIG, BIG LIE, IT'S A BIG
BETRAYAL.
I WANT T HAVE A TALK WITH
JASON JUST BECAUSE HE TRUSTED ME
AND I BETRAY HIM.
IT'S HURTFUL.
I FEEL BAD.
JUST HEAR ME OUT.
 OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
 THAT'S THE HAR
EVER DONE, BETRAY SOMEBOD
I SEE YOURSHIP AND SCOT
GROWING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER, AND
THAT WORRIED ME.
YOU MIGHT CUT ME LOOSE.
I DON'T KNOW. OR MIGHT
NOT, BUT I JUST HAD THE MAKE
UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU DIDU DID IT.
 BUT I DID IT IN THE NAME OF
THE GAME.
 BUT IT'S A GAME YOU CAN DO
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND STILL LOSE.
 YEAH.
I WAS SO WORRIED YOU WOULD COME
BACK SO MAD YOU'D RING HIS NECK.
 CHICKEN.
WE'RE STILL IN AN ALLIANCE,
RIGHT, BUDDY?
 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING ME
AND THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING
MY REASONS.
IT'S NOT FUNNY, KNOW.
 IT'S A GAME.
TAI DID APOLOGIZE TO ME THIS
MORNING.
IT WAS HALF-ASS APOLOGY, BUT I
CAN'T LET THEM SEE HOW MUCH IT
MADE ME ANGRY.
REALLY I JUST WEST BANK REVENGE
RIGHT NOW.
IT INFURIATED ME THAT I LEFT
WITHOUT AN IDOL OR AN ALLY, AND
TAI'S STILL GOT ALL HIS STUFF.
OLD HEART,URE FLIP-FLOPS A LOT.
SCREWS A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER.
HE SCREWED ME OVER, AND YOU'RE
O HAVE THE SAME FATE HE DESERVES
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL RACE THREW A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES COLLECTING
RINGS ALONG THE WAY.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE RINGS,
YOU'LL ATTEMPT TO LAND THEM ON A
SWINGING HOOK.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR IN.
 YES.
 Jeff: YOU'LL BE PICKED UP
BY CHOPPER, GIVEN AN AERIAL VIEW
OF THIS ISLAND YOU'VE BEEN
LIVING ON FOR THE PAST 28 DAYS.
THEN YOU'LL TOUCH DOWN ON THE
SAND SPIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
OCEAN WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A NICE
PICNIC, FRIED CHICKEN, CORN ON
THE COB, APPLE PIE.
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: SOFT DRINKS, A LITTLE
WINE.
 DID YOU SAY WINE?
 Jeff: I SAID WINE.
 HE SAID WINE.
 Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: ONE OTHER THING, YOU
WILL NOT BE RUNNING
INDIVIDUALLY.
YOU WILL BE TETHERED TOGETHER IN
PAIRS.
WE'RE GOING TO DO A RANDOM DRAW,
WHICH MEANS ONE PERSON WILL NOT
PARTICIPATE.
WE'LL DRAW FOR OUR PAIRS AND GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
THE RANDOM DRAW GAVE US THREE
PAIRS.
WE HAVE JOE AND TAI, JULIA WITH
AUBRY, MICHELE WITH CYDNEY,
JASON PICKED THE WRONG ROCK.
JASON WILL NOT PARTICIPATE.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
YOU'RE OVER THAT FIRST OBSTACLE.
JULIA AND AUBRY MAKING QUICK
WORK.
CYDNEY AND MICHELE, TAI AND JOE.
GOT TO UNTHAI THAT FIRST RING.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE RINGS,
WHICH YOU NEED TO FINISH THIS
CHALLENGE.
MICHELE AND CYDNEY MAKING QUICK
WORK OF THIS FIRST SECTION.
THERE'S TAI AND JOE WITH THEIR
FIRST RING.
JULIA AND AUBRY RIGHT BEHIND.
ALREADY AUBRY AND JULIA TAKE A
BIG FALL.
CYDNEY AND MICHELE OVER AND
UNDER, OVER AND UNDER.
GOT TO GO OVER THAT FIRST ONE,
UNDER THE SECOND ONE.
 UNDER.
 OVER.
 Jeff: MICHELE AND CYDNEY
STILL IN THE LEAD.
WORKING ON THAT SECOND RING.
JULIA AND AUBRY RIGHT BEHIND.
 WANT ME TO GET IT?
 OVER.
 Jeff: TAI AND JOE TRYING TO
CATCH UP.
MICHELE AND CYDNEY NOW HEADING
FOR THEIR THIRD RING.
 MY SIDE, MY SIDE, MY SIDE.
 Jeff: THERE GOES AUBRY AND
JULIA.
NOW YOU HAVE TO CLIMB THAT
LADDER.
 OKAY.
GOING UP.
 Jeff: TAI AND JOE WITH
THEIR SECOND RING.
MICHELE TRYING TO KNOCK IT OFF.
IT'S AUBRY TRYING TO GET IT OFF.
HERE GOES TAI NOW TRYING TO GET
IT OFF.
EVERYBODY PRETTY EVEN.
AUBRY AND JULIA HAVE THEIRS.
 GO!
 Jeff: THEY'RE NOW IN THE
LEAD.
CYDNEY GOING THE TAKE OVER NOW.
CAN SHE GET IT?
IT IS CYDNEY AND TAI.
TAI HAS HIS.
CYDNEY HAS HERS.
EVERYBODY HAS ALL THREE RINGS.
NOW YOU GOT TO HOOK 'EM.
TAI AND JOE RIGHT BEHIND.
EVERYBODY NOW TOSSING RINGS.
CYDNEY TOSSES ONE.
CYDNEY HOOKS ONE.
CYDNEY AND MICHELE HAVE THEIR
FIRST RING.
 WANT TO GO AGAIN?
 YEP.
 Jeff: BIG REWARD.
 SO CLOSE.
 Jeff: CHANCE TO TAKE A
BREAK FROM THE GAME OR EVEN
CHANGE THE GAME.
 LET ME TAKE A COUPLE SHOTS.
 Jeff: MICHELE HOOKS ONE.
WE'RE TIED 1-1.
MICHELE AND CYDNEY WITH ONE.
CYDNEY HOOKS A SECOND.
 NICE.
 Jeff: JOE HOOKS A SECOND.
WE'RE TIED 2-2.
JULIA AND AUBRY STILL TRYING TO
GET ON THE BOARD.
 WHY CAN'T WE GET IT?
 Jeff: COMING DOWN TO THE
LAST RING, IT IS CYDNEY AND
MICHELE, JOE AND TAI.
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.
FOR THE WIN, JUST MISSES.
CYDNEY FOR THE WIN.
CYDNEY TOSSES AND WINS!
CYDNEY, MICHELE WIN REWARD!
MICHELE AND CYDNEY, COME ON
OVER.
RIGHT HERE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR FIRST WIN.
 SHE'S WANTED FRIED CHICKEN.
 FOR A WHILE NOW.
 Jeff: HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN, CHOPPER WILL LAND,
PICK YOU UP, TAKE YOU ON A NICE
TOUR, DROP YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE OCEAN.
YOU'LL HAVE A PICNIC.
NOW, GIVEN FOR THE PAST 28 DAYS
THERE HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT
BLIND SIDES, IT SAYS THAT THESE
ALLIANCES ARE EVER SHIFTING IN
THIS GAME, WHICH SHOULD MAKE
THIS NEXT DECISION VERY
INTERESTING.
YOU GET TO PICK ONE PERSON TO
JOIN YOU.
IT CAN BE ANYBODY, INCLUDING
JASON, WHO DIDN'T COMPETE.
YOU TWO HAVE TO AGREE ON WHO THE
ONE PERSON IS GOING TO BE.
BOY, THAT WAS FAST, MICHELE,
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THERE WAS A
CONSENSUS SO QUICKLIEN SOMEBODY
HASN'T EATEN, AND THAT PERSON
SHOULD EAT.
 Jeff: WHO ARE YOU GOING TO
PICK?
 AUBRY.
 Jeff: AUBRY, COME ON OVER.
ALL RIGHT, CYDNEY, MICHELE,
AUBRY, ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.
CHOPPER IS COMING IN.
 I'M GLAD THAT ME AND CYDNEY
DECIDED ON AUBRY TO GO ON
REWARD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE LAST
NIGHT I WAS ON THE OUTSIDE OF
THE VOTE.
SO AT SOME POINT I HAVE TO BE
LIKE, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS MY
GAME.
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT I
AM IN WITH THEM AND THAT THEY
TRUST ME AND THAT THEY WANT TO
 THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED, DAY
ALL.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JO TAI,
JEWELBACK JASON, GOT NOTHING FOR
YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 IT'S PRETTY BLEK RIGHT NOW.
IT REALLY IS, BUT I'M NOT GIVING
UP YET.
I CAN'T.
FOR MY FAMILY I CAN'T.
KEEP TRYING. DO MY BEST, AND I'M
ULATEESE PEOPLE AND FIND A CRACK
SOMEWHERE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
 IT'S SO PRETTY.
THE FEELING FLYING THROUGH THE
AIR, I WAS JUST SCREAMING LEFT
AND RIGHT.
IT'S AON'T HAVE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
 BUTTY, BROWN AND BRAIN.
 PERFECT.
 I'M ON A HELICOPTER ZOOMING
AROUND THIS BEAUTIFUL BEACH, AND
IT'S OURS TO SHARE TOGETHER.
THAT'S... I MEAN, SURVIVOR
ABOUT ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
THIS IS JUST A NICE PICK-ME-UP
TO REFUEL AND RESET FOR TH NEXT
11 DAYS.
 WHITE OR ROSE?
 BOTH ARE REALLY GREAT.
 COLE SLAW.
 UH-HUH.
 MMM.
 THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THIS.
 THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.
 THE BEST DAY EVER.
 I GET BY IN MY LIFE ON MY
. BUILD RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT'S
WHAT'S GOTTEN ME THIS FAR IN THE
GAME.
ME AND JULIA ARE A TIGHT TWO.
AS MUCH AS I TRUST HER AND LOVE
WORKING WITH HER, WE'RE JUST TWO
PEOPLE.
TO GET BACK INTO THE GROOVE, I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THEM TRUST
ME.
 I WAN THE MAKE SU THAT
BECAUSE I WAS OUT IN THE BOAT, I
DIDN'T WANT I WAS
OUT IN THEIR A
 SO I OBVIOUSLY
JEWELBACK BUT ME, I DON'T
WANT MY QUESTIONED.
 I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS TO
WORK
 I WANT THIS. THIS TO WORK.
 I TOLD YOU I TRUST YOU.
 I TRUST YOU, TOO.
 I DO.
I TRUST YOU.
 MICHELE HAS PROVED HERSELF.
SHE'S VOTED EVERY TIME WITH US,
EXCEPT THE ONE WHERE WE HAD TO
LEAVE HER OUT, SO I TRUST HER.
 THIS IS TOO NICE.
 THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST
CHALLENGE.
 I DO FEEL REINTEGRATED INTO
THE GROUP, AND THAT ACTUALLY
SAYS A LOT ABOUT MY ABILITY TO
KEEP PEOPLE'S FAITH IN ME, JUST
BY STAYING HAPPY, STAYING
HUMBLE, STAYING SANE AND
HOPEFULLY MY LOYALTY WILL MAKE
THEM WANT TO KEEP ME FOR A
LITTLE BIT LONGER.
 OKAY SOME WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?
 I THINK WE ARE IN A GOOD
SPOT
MICHELE IS A GOOD OPTION.
 I THINK SO, TOO.
 I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WE'RE ON
THE MOUNTAINTOP, BUT I'D LIKE TO
THINK WE CAN GO LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF LIKE THAT.
EXACTLY. THE SAME TIME, WE CAN'T
THREE.
ICHELE, WEULD STILL PLAY BETTER.
 WE HAVE TO THINK.
IT'S GOOD TO START THINKING
ABOUT IT, BUT WE NEED TO GET OUT
JASON AND JULIA.
 RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO KEEP OUR
ALLIANCE WITH TAI VERY, VERY
STRONG BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE
DAY, HE CAN GET US FURTHER.
THE FACT THAT TAI HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND AN ADVANTAGE
MEANS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET
HIM OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND
WE CAN USE MICHELE TO DO IT.
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO GET TO THE
END OF THE GAME.
WHEN TO MAKE THIS BIG MOVE,
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.
 WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
 WE HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITY.
 IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE ME
ON THE BLOCK.
THERE' IN,
JULIA.FOR BOTH OF US.
 I'M AT THE BOTTOM.
SO I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT.
YOU GOT TO TRY.
THERE IS ROOM.S ALWAYS ROOM.
ALWAYS A WAY TO SQUEEZE
IN SOMEWHERE.
IT'S DO YOU FIND IT
AND I CAN'T BELIEVEHIS
CLOSE.
I WANT TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER.
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW.
 IF WE CAN GET RID OF TAI...
BUT IF THEY KEEP HIM AROUND
PURPOSELY, THAT'S STUPID.
 STUPID.
 WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS,
THOUGH.
 WHAT'S THE BEST CASE
SCENARIO, THOUGH?
 WE GET FOUR VOTE FOR HIM AND
HE PLAYS HIS IDOL AND SOMEONE
ELSE GOES HOME OR HE GOES HOM
WITH HIS IDO ME, WE GOT
HO IS OUR FOURTH. HAVE A FOURTH.
 TAI IS A BIG THREAT IN THIS
GAME BECAUSE WE KNOW TAI HAS
THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
HE HAS THIS ADVANTAGE.
AND WE KNOW TAI WILL WIN IF HE
GETS TO THE FINAL THREE.
SO WE NEED TO GET SOMEONE TO
REALIZE IT'S STUPID NOT TO USE
JASON AND JOE AND I'S NUMBERS TO
GET RID OF TAI.
TAI WOULD WORK WITH CYDNEY.
 WHEN SHE COMES BACK.
 WE HAVE A PLAN FOR TAI.
I SEE A CLEAR SHOT AT GETTING
WITH JULIA, MICHELE, BUT YOU
NEED FOUR.
IT ONLY REALLY TAKES CYDNEY.
CYDNEY LIKES THE MIND SIDE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
MAYBE SHE'S LOOKING FOR ANOTHER
BIG PLAY.
WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN
THE BEGINNING.
MAYBE SHE FLIPPED.
I GOT TO SELL, SELL, SELL.
 YOU THINKING OF DOING
ANYTHING CRAZY YET, SIR?
ALL DEPENDS IF YOU WANT THE GET
TAI OUT.
 WE'RE HERE.
THAT'S AN OPTION.
 WHEN WE WALK ENTER TRIBAL,
I'M WRITING T-A-I.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO VOTE
FOR ONE OF US BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO KILL OFF YOUR OWN, AND
TAI PLAYS HIS IDOL AND STAYS IN
AND ONE OF US GOES HOME, OR TAI
GETS BLIND SIDED, ALL THE IDOLS
ARE OUT OF THE GAME AND YOU GUYS
ARE STILL HOLDING NUMBERS.
 DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE.
 I THINK I PUT MYSELF IN A
GREAT POSITION.
I HAVE MY OPTIONS OPEN.
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, IT'S
ALL ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
IT'S A ME GAME, NOT A WE GAME.
IF I THINK STAYING IN MY
ALLIANCE IS BEST FOR ME, THAT'S
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
IF I HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE OUT
TAI WILL GET ME FURTHER, THAT'S
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR ME.
 SO YOU KNOW WE'RE VOTING FOR
HIM.
YOU DO YOU, BOO BOO.
 IF YOU'RE A TRUE FAN OF THIS
GAME, YOU KNOW IT'S DESIGNED TO
BE VICIOUS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN IF YOU
JUST ARE LOYAL AND FLOAT THROUGH
IT.
YOU HAVE THE CHEAT AND STEAL AND
MESS THINGS UP, AND I THINK THIS
BLINDSIDE OF TAI COULD
DEFINITELY CHANGE THE GAME.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT?
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
 Jeff:
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
JASON.
I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK.
 SORRY THE HEAR THAT.
 Jeff: WIN IT AGAIN.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE OUT THE A PLATFORM
WHERE YOU WILL MEMORIZE SYMBOLS
AND CORRESPONDING NUMBERS.
YOU'LL THEN RACE BACK AND USE
THOSE NUMBERS TO SOLVE A
COMBINATION THAT WILL RELEASE A
KEY.
IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, THE KEY
WILL OPEN A BOX CONTAINING
PUZZLE PIECES.
THE FIRST PERSON TO SOLVE THEIR
WORD PUZZLE WINS IMMUNITY
GUARANTEED A ONE IN SIX SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE AFTER 29 DAYS SOMEBODY
WILL BECOME THE FIFTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO BE YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
JASON OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD.
HIGH-STEPPING IT TO THAT
OBSTACLE.
GOT TO GET UP AND OVER THAT
PLATFORM.
GOING TO COME DOWN TO TESTING
YOUR MEMORY, AND AFTER 29 DAYS
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY SYMBOLS AND NUMBERS YOU
CAN HOLD ON TO AT ONCE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH NUMBERS
WITH SYMBOLS.
ONCE YOUR BRAIN FILLS UP, YOU
CAN HEAD BACK.
THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO
THE SYMBOL OR THE NUMBER THAT'S
WITH IT.
BUT YOU HAVE THE MAKE A
CONNECTION.
YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY IN YOUR
BRAIN TO CONNECT EVERY SYMBOL
AND LOCK THAT NUMBER IN.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH SYMBOLS
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED WHEN YOU
GET BACK TO THE START.
IT'S UNLIKELY YOU CAN REMEMBER
ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.
YOU HAVE TO MEMORIZE WHAT YOU
CAN AND THEN HEAD BACK.
CYDNEY'S GOT ENOUGH.
SHE'S HEADING BACK.
JASON RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
HE'S HEADING BACK.
HERE COMES MICHELE AND JULIA AND
AUBRY.
CYDNEY BROKE IT AND EVERYBODY
FOLLOWS.
IT'S NOW A RACE BACK.
HERE COMES TAI.
EVEN A TINY LITTLE OBSTACLE CAN
BE EXHAUSTING 29 DAYS INTO
"SURVIVOR."
AND THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE
MOVING, YOU ARE TRYING TO
REMEMBER ALL THOSE SYMBOLS AND
THE NUMBERS.
OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD.
NOW JOE'S STARTING TO KICK IT
INTO GEAR.
71 YEARS OLD.
NOT BAD.
CYDNEY AND JASON ARE GOING TO BE
BACK FIRST.
THERE'S MICHELE.
HERE COMES AUBRY KICKING IT INTO
FOURTH GEAR.
JULIA RIGHT ON HER TAIL.
NOW YOU GOT TO REMEMBER WHICH
NUMBER GOES WITH WHICH SYMBOL.
THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW MANY
SPACES TO TURN YOUR DIAL.
MICHELE WRITING HER NUMBERS IN
THE SAND TO LOCK THEM IN.
TAI NOW DOING THE SAME THING.
THERE ARE 12 SYMBOLS OUT THERE,
BUT YOU ONLY NEED 5.
THE QUESTION IS, DID YOU
MEMORIZE THE ONES YOU NEEDED AND
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBERS TO
SOLVE THE COMBINATION.
IF NOT, YOU HAVE TO HEAD BACK
OUT.
AUBRY HAS A FEW, BUT SHE'S GOT
TO HEAD BACK.
CYDNEY HEADING BACK OUT.
JOE COMES IN.
TAI GOING TO HEAD BACK OUT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH.
JULIA, MICHELE STILL WORKING,
HAVING ONLY SEEN THE NUMBERS ONE
TIME.
JASON NOW UNTYING A KEY.
THERE ARE EIGHT KEYS.
ONLY ONE UNLOCKS THE BOX.
JULIA NOW UNTYING A KEY.
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU RIGHT?
DID YOU MEMORIZE THE RIGHT
NUMBERS?
JASON THINKS HE HAS IT.
HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
IT WOULD BE AN IMPRESSIVE WIN TO
DO IT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK.
JULIA'S NOW GIVING IT A GO.
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT LOCK WILL
OPEN.
IF YOU GET WRONG, YOU HAVE TO GO
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
PLATFORM, SO YOU BETTER BE
RIGHT.
JASON IS WRONG.
HE'S GOT TO HEAD BECOME OUT.
JULIA IS RIGHT.
JULIA HAS OPENED HER BOX.
START WORKING ON YOUR WORD
PUZZLE.
MICHELE GIVING IT A GO.
JOE, YOU GOING TO SIT THIS OUT?
 YES, SIR.
I'VE RUN OUT OF GAS.
 Jeff: JOE GOING TO SIT THE
REST OF THIS OUT.
MICHELE HAS HERS RIGHT.
IT IS NOW EULA AND MICHELE.
BOTH WITH A MASSIVE TIME LEAD AS
EVERYBODY ELSE IS STILL OUT
CHECKING NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS.
UNBELIEVABLE PERFORMANCES.
JULIA AND MICHELE GOT IT VERY
QUICKLY.
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS THE WORD.
WHAT IS THAT WORD PUZZLE?
JASON AND AUBRY HEADING BACK.
JULIA TRYING TO MAKE SOME
PROGRESS.
MICHELE QUICKLY TRYING TO MAKE
PROGRESS.
YOU GOT THE FIGURE OUT THE
ORDER.
WHAT WORD IS IT YOU ARE TRYING
TO SOLVE?
MICHELE MOVING QUICKLY NOW.
SHE THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE IT.
IF SHE'S RIGHT, IT WOULD BE A
BIG WIN.
 JEFF?
 Jeff: SAY IT.
 BLIND SIDED.
 Jeff: YES!
MICHELE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
AND WILL NOT BE BLIND SIDED AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
MICHELE, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: I GOT TO ASK, HOW
MANY NUMBERS WERE YOU ABLE TO
MEMORIZE AT ONCE?
 I MEMORIZED ALL OF THEM.
 Jeff: WOW.
THAT AND YOU FINISHED SO FAST.
NICE JOB.
GUARANTEED A ONE IN SIX SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.
AS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME TONIGHT, SOMEBODY
WILL BECOME THE FIFTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY.
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
CONGRATS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 I NEEDED TO GET THAT WIN, AND
I GOT ONE SWING AT THE PLATE.
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE CYDNEY
AND MICHELE ARE ON BOARD WITH
THIS PLAN TO GET RID OF TAI OR
I'M SCREWED.
 MY FAMILY IS GOING TO BE SO
EXCITED.
SINCE THE REWARD, IT'S FOUR PLUS
MICHELE.
JASON AND JULIA ARE ON THE OUTS.
JASON IS A TICKING TIME BOMB, SO
TONIGHT SEEMS LIKE A SUPER EASY
VOTE, BUT NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE
BEST MOVE RIGHT NOW.
 SO WHAT'S THE STORY, MORNING
GLORY?
 PERSONALLY I'M THINKING
JASON, BECAUSE IF THERE IS
ANOTHER WATER CHALLENGE, HE'S
GOING TO BE OUT.
 JULIA WAS RIGHT BEHIND YOU
TODAY.
 SHE'S REALLY GREAT WITH
HERSELF.
SHE'S SO FAST.
SHE HAS A GREAT MEMORY.
SHE HAS BALANCE.
 SHE NAILED THE BALANCE.
 SHE WAS AHEAD OF ME.
I THINK I WAS THINKING JASON
BEFORE I KNEW SHE WAS THAT CLOSE
TO YOU.
 JASON IS A PHYSICAL THREAT,
BUT HE'S ALSO A VERY POLARIZING
CHARACTER.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE JURY, THERE
ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO LOVE
HIM AND PEOPLE WHO HATE HIM, SO
I DON'T THINK HE CAN WIN AT THE
END OF THE DAY.
THE THING ABOUT JULIA IS NOT
ONLY IS SHE A WELL-ROUNDED
PRAYER WHEN IT COMES TO THE
PHYSICAL PART OF THINGS, JULIA
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY BLOOD ON
HER HANDS BUT HAS PROVEN HERSELF
TO BE STRATEGIC ENOUGH TO BE
ABLE TO DODGE AND MANEUVER TO
KEEP HERSELF IN THIS GAME.
JULIA NEEDS TO GO.
 WHAT'S THE WORD?
 JULIA?
 WE AGREE AS A GROUP?
 YES.
 I WAS ORIGINALLY ON BOARD
WHEN WE WERE VOTING JASON, BUT
NOW THEY DECIDED THEY WANT JULIA
OUT.
IT FREAKING SUCKS.
IN A PERFECT WORLD I WOULD LOVE
TO GO FURTHER WITH JULIA.
I TRUST HER WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
SHE'S PROVED HERSELF TO ME OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE DAY
ONE, SO I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
WRITE DOWN THE NAME OF MY
BIGGEST ALLY.
 WE ALL KNOW SHE'S GOING TO
COME AND ASK ME.
 IF THEY ASK YOU, WE'RE GOING
WITH THE TAI THING.
 I DON'T WANT THE HEAR MY
NAME.
IT'S NEVER GOOD IN "SURVIVOR."
I DON'T TRUST AND I'M STILL A
LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
MICHELE.
 SHAKE AND BAKE, BABY.
 THIS IS THE "SURVIVOR" GAME.
I HAVE TO DOT MY "T" AND CROSS
MY "I," HOWEVER YOU SAY IT.
TONIGHT I'M BRINGING MY IDOL AND
MY ADVANTAGE.
I'M NOT GOING TO GO HOME WITH AN
IDOL IN MY POCKET.
 SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?
 OUR BACKS ARE AGAINST THE
WALL WITH THE TAI IDOL THING.
IF TAI GOES TO THE FINAL, HE'S
GOING TO WIN.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO VOTE TAI.
 YOU KNOW, EARLIER I TOLD
EVERYONE I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR
EULA TO KEEP EVERYONE HAPPY AND
TO LOCK IN THAT I'M WITH THEM
100%, BUT IF JASON AND JULIA
REALLY DO HAVE CYDNEY, THEN THE
TAI VOTE COULD WORK OUT AND IT
WOULD ALSO SAVE JEWEL, YEAH
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE IT'S
BEEN KILLING ME TO THINK I WOULD
HAVE TO GO AGAINST HER.
 GETTING RID OF TAI IS
CRUCIAL.
 HOPEFULLY CYDNEY IS WITH US.
 ALL RIGHT.
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
 WE'RE GOING WITH THE TAI
THING.
 AT LEAST ONE IDOL IS GONE
TONIGHT.
 EXACTLY.
 SO I'M HOPING WE HAVE THE
NUMBERS TO GET RID OF TAI, BUT
IT DOESN'T MEAN THINGS ARE
GUARANTEED.
TAI PLAYS HIS IDOL, HE'S SAFE,
ONE OF US GOES.
I MEAN, JULIA AND I ARE TWO.
IF YOU AND MICHELE DO IT, IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO.
 YOU'RE DOWN, I'M DOWN.
 YEP.
 TONIGHT MICHELE AND I HAVE
TWO OPTIONS.
WE CAN EITHER GO WITH JULIA AND
JASON AND BLIND SIDE TAI, OR DO
THE ORIGINAL PLAN OF GOING WITH
OUR ALLIANCE AND BLIND SIDING
JULIA.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 IT'S NICE TO HAVE OPTIONS.
 100%.
BUT EVERY LITTLE THING WE DO HAS
TO BE WITH A PURPOSE.
 EXACTLY.
 ARE THEY GOING AFTER TAI OR
ARE THEY BLIND SIDING ME?
 MICHELE SAID THAT SHE'S
VOTING TAI.
IN A PERFECT WORLD, TAI WILL GO
HOME WITH THE IDOL IN HIS
POCKET.
 AND WE'RE STILL HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
IF I GO, AT LEAST MAYBE HE LOSES
HIS IDOL.
THE SAME WAY HE MADE MY IDOL GO
WALKING OUT THAT DOOR.
 A LOT IS RIDING ON TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL FOR ME.
I HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE
REGARDING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
JULIA AND MY ALLIANCE.
I DON'T WANT TO BACKSTAB EITHER
SIDE.
I'M STRUGGLING TO DECIDE WHAT
ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN.
IT CAN REALLY AFFECT YOUR GAME
MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY, AND
ALL I CAN DO IS FIGHT AND PLAY
MY GAME.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
NEAL, NICK, DEBBIE, AND SCOT,
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
SO JULIA, WHERE ARE WE IN THE
GAME RIGHT NOW?
 I THINK THAT WE ARE AT A
CRUCIAL POINT IN THIS GAME RIGHT
NOW.
I THINK EVERY DECISION WE MAKE,
EVERY PERSON WE DECIDE TO VOTE
OUT, EVERY CONVERSATION WE HAVE
CAN MAKE OR BREAK A PERSON'S
GAME.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN FEEL
100% SAFE TONIGHT IS MICHELE.
 Jeff: JASON, DO YOU FEEL
THAT SAME THING, THAT EVERY
ACTION YOU TAKE FROM HERE ON OUT
WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THAT
MILLION DOLLARS?
 MOST DEFINITELY, EVERY THING
YOU DO, EVERY LITTLE WORD THAT
COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,
EVERYONE IS REMEMBERING.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T, BUT YOU
GOT TO WEIGH ALL OPTIONS.
BECAUSE SOMEONE IN THAT FIVE IS
NUMBER FIVE.
 Jeff: JULIA, WHO DO YOU
THINK IS ON THE BOTTOM?
 I THINK OF THE ALLIANCE AND
FIVE, MICHELE AND CYDNEY ARE ON
THE BOTTOM.
I THINK AUBRY IS HOLDING JOE'S
HAND TO THE FINAL THREE, AND,
YOU KNOW, TAI IS A STRONG
COMPETITOR OUT HERE, AND TAI HAS
POTENTIAL TO WIN THIS GAME, SO
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT THE
LOOKED A AND KIND OF WANT THE
SHAKE UP.
 Jeff: TAI GOT TO BE A
LITTLE UNNERVING TO HEAR JULIA
THROW YOUR NAME AROUND.
 YES, BECAUSE I HAVE THE IDOL,
AND I ALSO HAVE THE SECRET
ADVANTAGE.
I'M FULLY AWARE OF THAT, AND
IT'S NERVE-RACKING.
I JUST, YOU KNOW, REMIND MY
ALLIANCE, JOE, AUBRY, CYDNEY AND
MICHELE, WHY JUMP ON THE A
SINKING SHIP AND ROW WITH THEM
WHEN YOU HAVE A GUARANTEED SPOT.
 Jeff: AUBRY, YOUR NAME WAS
BROUGHT UP, AS WELL.
 YES.
 Jeff: IS IT AS NERVE
RAGGING FOR YOU AS IT SEEMS FOR
TAI?
 IT IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY, BUT
YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE
RELATIONSHIPS YOU FORGED WITH
PEOPLE AND TRUST THAT.
 Jeff:
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I
TRUSTED MY ALLIANCE, AND WHAT
HAPPENED?
SCOT, BYE.
TAI STARTED FLIPPING MORE THAN A
FLAPJACK.
HE'S DONE IT TWO TIMES ALREADY
TO HIS SOLID ALLIANCES.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE WON'T
BE A THIRD?
 BUT THE BOND BETWEEN YOU AND
SCOT WAS SO STRONG, YOU TWO WERE
IN CONTROL.
THAT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.
I NEED THE BREAK THAT UP.
 SO YOU LEFT MY ALLIANCE
BECAUSE SCOT AND I WERE CLOSE
AND WENT THE AN ALLIANCE WHERE
AUBRY AND JOE ARE EVEN CLOSER.
 Jeff: SO MICHELE, JASON
MAKES THE CASE YOU CAN'T TRUST
TAI.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ALLIANCES SO
TRICKY.
SO ARE YOU CONSTANTLY
EVALUATING, IS THE FIVE TIGHT?
SHOULD I MAKE A MOVE?
IS THIS THE RIGHT MOVE?
 YEAH.
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT THAT I'M
NOT THINKING, AND YOU HAVE TO BE
THINKING AHEAD IN THIS GAME.
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO MAKE
MOVES AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER
IN ORDER FOR YOUR GAME TO BE
RESPECTED.
YOU KNOW, YOU SIT AT THE END AND
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO
SAY.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, MICHELE
BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT.
IT'S TRICKY TO VOTE PEOPLE OUT,
SQUASHING THEIR MILLION DOLLAR
DREAM, AND THEN TURNING AROUND
SAYING, GIVE IT TO ME.
 WITH THE JURY, YOU WANT THEM
TO RESPECT YOUR GAME PLAY.
THEY'LL GIVE THE MILLION DOLLARS
TO PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE GAME
VERSUS SOMEONE JUST THROWING
PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS LEFT AND
RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THEY JUST
GOT FURTHER THAT WAY.
 Jeff: SO JASON, YOU HAVE A
COMMON INTEREST.
THERE'S AN OVERLAP.
YOU WANT BACK IN.
THE FIVE NEED TO MAKE A MOVE IN
ORDER TO MAKE THEIR CASE AT THE
END, AND SENATOR IN THERE MIGHT
BE A MARRIAGE THAT ONE CAN HELP
THE OTHER.
 I COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER
MYSELF, JEFF.
EVERY PERSON HERE THAT'S IN THE
CLIQUE, THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
JUSTIFY TO EVERY PERSON THAT
SITS AT THE BENCH, WHY ME?
WHAT DID I DO?
HOW DID IT OUTPLAY?
HOW DID I OUTWIT?
HOW DID I OUTLAST?
WE'RE TWO ISLANDS LOOKING FOR A
HOME RIGHT NOW?
THE PERFECT PEOPLE TO BRING IN
AND SAY, HEY, I'M TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING CRAZY.
WE ALL KNOW FROM TRIBALS WITH
ME, I ENJOY DOING CRAZY STUFF.
 Jeff: SO MICHELE, IF THE
RIGHT SITUATION CAME AROUND, ARE
YOU THE TYPE OF PLAYER WHO WOULD
SAY, YEAH, I'LL MAKE A MOVE?
 YOU GOT TO GO WITH YOUR GUT
IN THIS GAME, AND YOU HAVE TO
FEEL CONFIDENT IN THE DECISION
THAT YOU'RE MAKING, AND, YOU
KNOW, IF YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT
UNCOMFORTABLE, IT MIGHT BE
SAYING SOMETHING.
I THINK YOUR INTUITION IS A LOT
IN THIS GAME.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GO WITH MINE.
 Jeff: CYDNEY, ARE YOU THE
TYPE OF PLAYER OPEN TO A BIG
MOVE?
 DEFINITELY.
IF THE IDEA PRESENTS ITSELF, YOU
NEED TO TAKE IT IN AND LISTEN TO
IT.
EVERY DECISION AT THIS POINT IS
EITHER GOING TO MAKE YOU OR
BREAK YOU.
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE
YOU WANT TO HAPPEN.
 Jeff: TAI, YOU WERE JUST
PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION.
HOW COMFORTABLE ARE YOU RIGHT
NOW AS WE GET READY TO VOTE IN.
 I'M NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL.
I'M GOING TO... I'M REALLY NOT
COMFORTABLE.
 Jeff: WOW.
ONCE AGAIN WE HEAD INTO THE VOTE
WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JASON, YOU'RE UP.
OUT THIS TIME.
OUT THIS TIME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
 SHOULD I PLAY IT?
 GO WITH YOUR GUT.
 Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, TAI.
JULIA.
TAI.
THAT'S TWO VOTES TAI.
JULIA.
THAT'S TWO VOTES TAI, TWO VOTES
JULIA.
JULIA.
THAT'S THREE VOTES JULIA, TWO
VOTES TAI.
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND FIFTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JULIA.
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JULIA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, FOR MAYBE THE FIRST TIME
IN THIS GAME, NOBODY CAME INTO
TRIBAL COUNCIL CONFIDENT.
FEAR HAS ENTERED THE GAME.
AND WHEN FEAR IS IN CONTROL,
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BECOME THE CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," JASON IS DOWN AND
OUT.
 NO ONE WILL STRATEGIZE WITH
ME.
IT PISSES ME OFF.
 Jeff: UNTIL THE MAJORITY
STARTS TO CRUMBLE FROM WITHIN.
 YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN THIS
SHOW.
I'M LIKE, NO.
IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT, WOULD YOU
VOTE WITH ME OR WOULD YOU VOTE
WITH HIM?
 THIS IS A ROUGH ONE.
 I'M BUMMED, BUT I'M PROUD OF
THE WAY I PLAYED.
BEING ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE
EVER TO PLAY THIS GAME, I FEEL
LIKE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
GROW UP OUT HERE, LEARN A LOT
ABOUT MYSELF.
I DID MAKE SOME BIG MOVES AND
HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO SOME
AWESOME BLIND SIDES.
I DIDN'T GO OUT NOT TRYING.
I DIDN'T GO OUT BEING DRAGGED
ALONG, SO AT LEAST I KNOW I
PLAYED.
