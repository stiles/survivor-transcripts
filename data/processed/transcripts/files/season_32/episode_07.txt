 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON "SURVIVOR": THIS SEASON--
MEDICAL!
HAS BEEN A TEST OF WILLS.
IT'S NOT EASY.
Jeff: WITH PERSEVERANCE, NEAL--
THE IDOL.
Jeff: TAI.
WHOA!
Jeff: AND JAISON, EACH FOUND AN IDOL.
BUT SCOT WHO HAD TIES WITH TAI AND JAISON.
IT BECOMES SUPER IDOL.








Jeff: CHE CHA CHAN LOH TRIBE, THEY WERE TORN ON WHICH WAY TO
GO.
DEBBIE WANTS US TO WORK WITH HER.
I DON'T THINK WE TRUST DEBBIE.
Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, GONDOL LOST.
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, TAI, JULIA, AND SCOT HAD A PLAN TO
GET RID OF PETER AND TRIED TO CONVINCE AUBRY TO GO ALONG.
PETER IS USING YOU RIGHT NOW.
Jeff: BUT AUBRY WAS CONFLICTED.
IF WE TAKE OUT PETER, THEY'RE GOING TO COME AFTER US NEXT.
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, IT'S GOING PLOA BACK AN BITE ME IN THE ASS.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ORIGINAL PLAN.
Jeff: AUBRY WAS STILL SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE VOTE SHE








CHANGED HERS AT THE LAST SECOND.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT, PETER.
PETER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
AND NOW, EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR.
11 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
WHY IS IT CONFUSING?
WHAT'S THE ORIGINAL PLAN?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM, YOU GUYS DON'T MAKE A DECISION AND STICK
WITH IT, SO I WAS JUST CLEARING IT IT UP FOR JULIA.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE VOTED THE RIGHT WAY, BUT YOU DIDN'T
VOTE THE RIGHT WAY.
I AM ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE PICKING OFF THE BRAIN TRIBE NOW,
BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF THAT INDECISION, BECAUSE I CAN'T
TRUST THEM.
YOU STILL VOTED FOR JULIA, AND SO DID JOE.
THAT'S A STRANGE WAY OF BUILDING TRUST.
I DIDN'T VOTE FOR JULIA.
YOU WROTE HER NAME DOWN.
I CROSSED IT OUT.
PETER WENT HOME, WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT
I WENT UP THERE, WROTE JULIA, CROSSED IT OUT AND WROTE PETER,
AND I ENDED UP PUTTING A TARGET ON MY BACK AND ON JOE'S.
SO FUTURE OF THE BRAINS TRIBE, WE'RE DONE.
I THINK THAT'S IT.
AND I THINK IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.
AND YOU GUYS MADE IT INTO SOMETHING IT WASN'T BY VOTING
FOR HER.
IF I HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER TRIBAL, I AM ABSOLUTELY GOING TO
WRITE DOWN AUBRY, JOE, AUBRY, JOE.
AND I'LL JUST CROSS THEM OUT UNTIL I DECIDE WHICH ONE I WANT
TO GO FIRST.
BOY-- CHICKEN, WIND CHILL INDEXEN.
HE WANTS THAT FOOD.
AUBRY, AFTER YOU DIG THAT OUT, WE CAN JUST-- OH, MY GOSH!
THIS IS PEOPLE FOOD.
YOU GET YOUR SHARE LATER.
STOP!
NO!
HE WANTS IT, MAN.
NO, NO, NO!
NO!
GO OVER HERE.
YOU EAT THIS.
YOU CAN PECK AT THIS.
HE WANTS THE LOOSE FEESES.
TAI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHICKEN IS A FATHER TO A SON, I
THINK.
HE DOES EVERYTHING WITH THE DAMN BIRD.
HE PROBABLY LIKES IT BETTER THAN US.
AFTER TRIBAL, AUBRY AND I, WE'RE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, AND NOW
TAI AND SCOT AND JULIA, THEY'VE GOT A THREE SELLAND TWO BRAINS,
AND BYE-BYE BRAINS.
AUBRY, SHE AT LEAST CHANGED HER VOTE BACK TO PETER.
SO BOOM-BOOM, JOE'S DONE BECAUSE I BROKE RANKS.
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME THAT CHICKEN'S DOING BETTER THAN ME.
HE DOESN'T MISS A TRICK.
HE DOES NOT MISS A TRICK.
BOY.
HE LIKES THE COCONUT.
YEAH.
NEAL WAS WALKING AROUND WITH A BIG BULGE IN HIS POCKET, AND
I'M JUST LIKE HMMM.
I KNOW WHAT THE IDOL LOOKS LIKE.
SO WHEN I SAW THE IMPRINT IN NEAL'S POCKET, I LOOKED AT
JAISON.
I WAS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLUSH THAT BAD BOY OUT.
WHICH POCKET?
THE LEFT.
IN HIS CARGO.
HMM-HMM.
SO HOW TIE IT IS.
IT'S A LOT HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
IT'S CREEPING UP.
WOW, MORE CRABS.
THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE CRAPS.
WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR POCKET?
NEAL HAS A BULGE IN HIS CARGO POCKET, AND THE REASON I THINK
IT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE THE IDOL IS BECAUSE I HAVE A MATCHING
ONE.
NOW THE TARGET'S REALLY ON HIM BECAUSE THAT MAKES HIM A THREAT
TO EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, BUT I GOT TO WAIT.
I GOT TO PLANT THE SEEDS AND WAIT FOR THE PERFECT TIME TO
SPROUT UP.
I'M AS PLEASED AS PUNCH RIGHT NOW.
I KIND OF HOLD ALL THE POWER.
GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S HEADED TOWARDS US.
WHAT ON EARTH?
SURPRISE, SURPRISED, HUH?
I WAS SITTING ON THE BEACH FEELING PRETTY GOOD, GETTING
READY TO BLINDSIDE NEAL, AND THEN THIS BOAT SHOWS UP.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
CHAN LOH YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTE TO PICK UP EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND
BOARD THIS BOAT.
YOU'RE HEADING TO YOUR NEW HOME AT THE GONDOL CAMP.
FIVE MINUTES IS NOT A LOT OF TIME.
I MADE THE "SURVIVOR" MERGE.
THAT'S CRAZY!
IT'S LIKE MY DREAM AS A KID.
BUT, YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS IN A GOOD POSITION AT CHAN
LOH.
NOWEG EVERYTHING SHIFTED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THAT'S A
SCARY THOUGHT.
I GOT THEM.
I GOT THEM.
I GOT THEM.
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TOUGH SO MAKING THE
MERGE IS HUGE.
I MADE IT.
I NEVER DOUBTED THEY WOULD MAKE IT, HOWEVER.
YOU KNOW, THE GAME IS SWITCHED UP AGAIN AND IT'S REALLY GOING
TO BE INSANE OUT THERE.
I LOVE CHANGE.
I LOVE MIXING IT UP.
I TAKE THE OFFENSE, PULL PEOPLE IN, BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO BE
PULLED IN.
EVERYBODY'S DANGLING.
I'LL PULL THEM IN.
LOCK THEM DOWN.
AHOY!
AHOY!
IT'S THE MERGE!
OH, MY GOD!
( SCREAMING ) WHAT!
WE'RE SAVED!
I MADE IT TO THE MERGE!
I MADE IT TO THE MERGE ON "SURVIVOR."
THAT IS AWESOME.
IT IS SUCH A HUGE DEAL.
AND AS SOON AS I SAW JAISON AND CYDNEY, I JUST THOUGHT, OH, MAN,
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN THE PLAY-OFFS.
IT'S TIME TO START OVER, REFOCUS.
HOPEFULLY MY TEAM IS STRONG AND READY TO GET A CHAMPIONSHIP.
I'M HOME!
AND JUST LIKE THAT, JOE AND I HAVE BEEN SAVED.
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, I FELT LIKE TOTAL CRAP, SO MUCH SO,
THAT I WAS TELLING MYSELF I'M A FREE AGENT.
I'M SEPARATING FROM JOE.
THAT'S IT.
AND THEN TO SEE NEAL AND DEBBIE, I WAS SO RELIEVED.
IT WAS LIKE BEING SEPARATED FROM YOUR WHACKY FAMILY AND THEN
SEEING THEM AGAIN.
I WOULD LOVE SOME SOFT CHEESE.
WHOSE GOT THE CRACKERS.
PASS THE CRACKERS.
SO HAIP WITH THE WINE.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE MERGE.
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY!
EVERYBODY EARNED IT.
DOWN THE HATCH.
BRAINS, BEAUTY AND BRAWN ALL TOGETHER FINALLY, YOU'RE
THINKING NUMBER-- FOUR BEAUTY, FOUR BRAIN, THREE BRAWN.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO LINE UP?
IN "SURVIVOR," I HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY.
SCOT IS THE ONLY ALLY I KNOW AND HE'S THE MOST LOGICAL, SINCE HE
KNOWS ABOUT THE IDOL.
OKAY, NICK I HAVE A FULL CONFESSION.
NOT NOW.
I JUST WANTED TO CUDDLE WITH YOU JUST ONCE.
I'M HAPPILY MARRIED, BUT YOU ARE A VERY GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
( PURRING ) TAI.
( PURRING ).
BACK OFF!
I'M TAKING HIM NO!
I'LL SAVE YOU.
DURING THE MERGE FEAST, PEOPLE WERE GETTING A LITTLE
TIPSY, BUT I'M LISTENING LEFT AND RIGHT, SEEING WHO'S GETTING
ALONG, SEEING WHAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.
AND IT'S OBVIOUS THE BRAWN ARE GOING TO BE ARROGANT, LIKE
THEY'RE IN CHARGE AND NOBODY CAN STOP THEM.
CYDNEY AND THE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SCOT'S
KNOCKED OUT, AND THERE'S A RAT ON HIS SHOULDER.
AND WE'RE LIKE, WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL HIM.
THE BRAINS ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO WORK WITH THAT TYPE OF
PERSON BECAUSE THEATRE EXACT OPPOSITE.
THEY WANT TO BE IN THE SHADOWS.
I'M GOOD.
I CAN'T EAT ANYMORE.
EAT A DAMN COOKIE!
RIGHT NOW, MY TRUE ALLIANCE IS WITH MICHELE.
WE'RE IN A GREAT SPOT WITHIN THESE TWO TRIBES, BUT I'VE
LEARNED SLOW IT DOWN.
READ THE PEOPLE.
LET THEM KEEP BRINGING YOU INFORMATION, AND THEN YOU JUST
SLICE THEM UP.
PETER WENT INSANE.
YOU GUYS ARE ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW.
NO, YOU'RE IN.
I'VE GOT YOUR BARK MAN.
ARE YOU AND NEAL STILL GOOD?
ABSOLUTELY.
TIGHTER THAN EVER.
SALT AND PEPPER.
EBONY AND IVORY.
OKAY.
TOILT TOILET PAPER AND TOILETS, YEAH.
AUBRY IS A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT THE WAY THINGS PANNED OUT AND
FEELS GUILTY.
SHE HAS NO NEED TO DO WHAT.
I KNOW THE FOUR BRAINS-- MYSELF, AUBRY, NEAL AND JOE-- WE'RE
STILL STRONG.
SEEMS LIKE THE BRAWN ARE SUPER TIGHT.
THAT'S THREE, RIGHT?
DEFINITELY.
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD BE WILLING TO STICK TOGETHER.
YEAH?
THE BRAWN ARE GOING TO BE AN ONGOING PHYSICAL THREAT.
BUT THEY'RE JUST KIND OF BULLIES.
SO IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH A BEAUTY AND BRAIN ALLIANCE.
DO YOU THINK YOUR BEAUTIES ARE GOING TO STICK TOGETHER AND
HAVE YOUR BACKS.
THE BEAUTIES.
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M GETTING THE VIBE THAT TAI IS SUPER TIGHT WITH SCOT NOW, AND
I'M GETTING THE VIBE THAT JULIA WAS SAVED LAST NIGHT BY SCOT.
WHAT ABOUT MICHELE?
MICHELE, I THINK SHE'LL STICK WITH ME.
I HOPE SO.
NEAL AND AUBRY PITCHED THE FACT THAT, HEY, WE JUST NEED TWO MORE
OF YOUR BEAUTY.
NICK, CAN YOU GET IN MICHELE?
YEAH, I CAN PROBABLY GET IN MICHELE.
SO THEY WANTED TO BE THE BRAINS VERSUS THE BRAWN, JUST LIKE I
THOUGHT.
SO HOW MANY VOTES DO WE NEED, THEN?
SIX TO WIN.
SIX TO WIN THIS VOTE, OKAY.
AND WE JUST FUT ON ONE OF THE THREE BRONZE.
DOES IT MATTER WHO?
PREFERABLY ONE THAT HAS AN IDOL.
IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH THE BRAINS, BUT IF YOU CORNER
YOURSELF, IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOUR BACK IS
AGAINST THE WALL, THAT'S NOT GOOD "SURVIVOR."
DO SOME STARS.
I'M GOING TO START WRITING NAMES.
DO YOU WANT TO DO RED?
ISN'T THAT CUTE?
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH, LIKE, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.
I'M SO HAPPY.
YOU GUYS HAVE GOTTEN ALONG OVER HERE, THOUGH?
WELL, TAI AND I ARE... WE'RE GOOD.
JULIA, I THINK WE HAVE LOYALTY BECAUSE WE SAVED HER LAST NIGHT.
OH, YEAH, SHE'S INDEBTED TO YOU GUYS.
SO WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT.
IT'S MERGE TIME.
AND THE BRAWN, WE GOT TO GET BACK ON TRACK.
SO WE WERE OPEN WITH NICK, BECAUSE WE WANT HIM TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE.
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED HIM FOR THE NUMBERS.
AND I BELIEVE THAT NEAL HAS AN IDOL.
SO NEAL IS THE MAIN FOCUS.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
I THINK NEAL HAS AN IDOL.
SO HOW DO WE GET HIM OUT FIRST?
YOU SPLIT IT.
SPLIT THE VOTE, OKAY.
YOU GOTTA WONDER IF SCOT AND JAISON HAD TOO MUCH RUM AT THE
MERGE FEAST.
SCOT WELCOMED ME RIGHT AWAY, AND JAISON SAYS, "NEAL HAS AN IDOL."
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME INTO YOUR ALLIANCE.
YOU'RE SUCH SWEETHEARTS, BOTH OF US.
THIS IS THE THREE OF US, NOT EVEN CYDNEY.
TAI FOUND AN IDOL.
HE SHOWED IT TO ME.
HOLY CRAP.
THIS IS UNREAL.
TAI HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE WHEN
YOU TAKE TWO SEPARATE IDOLS, MINE AND EVEN HIS, AND YOU LINK
THEM TOGETHER, NOW WE HAVE A SUPER IDOL THAT WE CAN PLAY
AFTER THE VOTES HAVE BEEN READ, WHICH MEANS WE ARE LITERALLY
UNSTOPPABLE.
NOW, ONLY YOU AND TAI KNOW ABOUT TAI'S IDOL.
NOW YOU TWO.
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.
THE ONLY REASON I TOLD YOU IS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE TIGHT.
I DON'T LIKE SCOT'S AND JAISON'S OVER-CONFIDENCE.
THEY'RE JUST LIKE SCREW EVERYBODY ELSE.
THIS IS OUR GAME.
BUT AS MUCH AS IT ANNOYS ME, THAT'S A GREAT THING FOR ME.
IT REALLY IS.
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO EXPECT A BLINDSIDE ON THEM.
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE IT COMING.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DISGUSTING?
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M TOOIG.
MY FIREMEN.
GOOD MORNING!
TAI, I REALLY LIKE YOU.
I WANT TO GET IN AN ALLIANCE.
OKAY.
WE'D HAVE THE NUMBERS.
WE'D HAVE THE NUMBERS?
YEP.
OKAY.
I SEEM TO BE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE HERE THAT PLAYS OFFENSE,
AND I KNOW I NEED SIX TO HAVE THE NUMBERS OVER BRAWN.
IT'S A BATTLE FOR POWER, AND I'M PLAYING TO WIN.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A DONE DEAL.
I MEAN, IT'S COMING AS SUCH A SHOCK.
UH-- WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY HERE ON
OUT, NOW THAT WE'RE SINGLE.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO GO INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH
SOMEBODY.
YOU JUST DID.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, I DIDN'T EVEN SIT DOWN, DEBBIE
LIKE TWO SECONDING BEHIND ME, SHE SAY, "HEY, I REALLY LIKE
YOU.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN OUR ALLIANCE."
IT WAS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.
HE'S IN.
WE GOT HIM.
I'M NOT BUYING HER STORY.
I'M NOT A FOOL.
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH DEBBIE.
SO, NICK, ARE YOU WITH US?
NEAL AND YOU?
AND PROBABLY MICHELE, TOO.
SO, DEBBIE THINKS THAT SHE HAS MICHELE?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT GOING HOME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.
SHE'S NOT BEING VERY FINESSEY ABOUT THIS.
AND ZIP IT.
DEB NEEDS TO COOL HER JETS.
SHE IS TRYING TOO HARD.
DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAMING PEOPLE ISN'T THE WAY TO GO WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO GET THE NUMBERS.
YOU HAVE TO SHOW CONFIDENCE, AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE SHOWING
DESPERATION.
IF THE BRAWN AND BEAUTY BAND TOGETHER--
THERE'S SO MANY OF US.
WE'RE SEVEN TO FOUR.
WE'LL MAKE ONE FAMILY AND FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE.
BOUD BUTTY ALWAYS GOES WITH THE JOCK, ALWAYS.
IT'S JUST THE WAY OF THE WORLD.
THE BOUD BUTTIES DON'T DATE THE BRAINIACS.
THEY'RE AT THE DANCE WITH US AND WE'RE SHOVING GEEKS IN LOCKERS
NOW.
SORRY, BRAIN.
NEAL HAS AN IDOL.
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF AUBRY.
THEY WON'T SEE IT COMING.
WE WANT TO GO AFTER NEAL, BUT WE BELIEVE HE'S HOLDING THE
IDOL.
SO WE TAKE OUT SOMEONE THEY NEVER SEE COMING, AUBRY.
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK IT'S NEAL, THEN JOE.
THEN DEB.
THEY'LL THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE.
YEAH.
I THINK JAISON PROBABLY THINKS THAT HE'S ON TOP.
HE'S THE ONE WHO IS CONSTANTLY GOING, "HEY, THIS IS WHAT'S
GOING ON.
THIS IS WHAT THIS PERSON SAID.
THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING."
SO IT LOOKS LIKE BRAWN AND BEAUTY ARE KIND OF TOGETHER.
BUT BRAWN IS WAY TOO CONTROLLING.
OH, MAN.
AND I NEVER COUNTED OUT WORKING WITH BRAIN.
SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER TALKED TO YOU BEFORE.
I KNOW, RIGHT?
BUT-- NOT ONE ON ONE.
YEAH.
I'M ON BOARD WITH THE BRAINS STICKING TOGETHER, BUT SOMEONE
IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR HEAD OUT OF THEIR BUTT AND START
TALKING TO PEOPLE LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING.
DEBBIE IS GOING OFF HER ROCKER.
YOU CAN'T DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TEAM PEOPLE.
SHE GOES OFF THE HANDLE.
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE ARE IRRITATED BY
DEBBIE, AND IF WE DON'T GET THE BEAUTIES ON OUR SIDE, THE BRAINS
ARE SCREWED.
I MEAN, I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.
NO, I KNOW.
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE-- BUT THE THING SDEBBIE, I'M
TELLING YOU, DEBBIE'S AWFUL.
I'M STILL OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE BRAIN TRIBE, BUT DEBBIE IS
AGGRAVATING ME AT THIS POINT.
SHE ALMOST TAKES STRATEGY IN HER OWN HANDS FOR THE BRAINS TRIBE,
AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY HAVING MORE POWER THAN I DO IN THIS
GAME.
EVERYONE IS TOTALLY FED UP WITH DEBBIE, AND I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE SCREWED BECAUSE OF IT.
DO YOU THINK NICK IS RUNNING AWAY?
I TALKED TO NICK, AND I THINK HE'S-- YEAH.
I DO.
I THINK FOR HIM, LIKE, JUST GOING BY THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS
IS POSSIBLY MORE APPEALING THAN DEEG DOOELG WITH DEB RIGHT NOW.
IT'S REALLY BAD.
WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET AT LEAST TWO OF THE BEAUTIES ON
BOARD, BUT PEOPLE ARE SO TURNED OFF BY DEBBIE.
IT'S BAD.
WE'RE IN A BAD SITUATION.
DO YOU HAVE THE IDOL?
I HAVE ONE FROM THE FIRST CAMP.
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE.
SO HOW CAN WE TIEWZ TO OUR ADVANTAGE?
SOMEONE HAS TO TELL US WHO'S GETTING VOTED OUT TOMORROW.
AND WE JUST USE IT.
I'M GETTING A GOOD ROLLER COASTER OUT OF "SURVIVOR," MAN.
I WAS THINKING WE'RE SCREWED.
BUT NOW, IT TURNS OUT NEAL HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED TO START DOING THINGS.
THE GAME IS ON.
LET'S GO.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
ALL RIGHT, SO I WAS TALKING TO MEDICAL, AND THEY SAID YOU GUYS
WERE PRETTY BANGED UP.
TAI, BE HOW IS THIS GROUP DOING PHYSICALLY?
WE HAVE A LOT OF CUTS, EARLY ON, THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I
KNOW THAT NEAL HAS A COUPLE OF INFECTIONES.
Jeff: A COUPLE OF INFECTIONS?
I KIND OF HAD THIS LITTLE VOLCANO POP UP IN MY KNEE.
I DUBBED IT "MOUNT SAINT NEAL."
IT FEELS FINE, THOUGH.
Jeff: SCOT, IS THERE AN AWARENESS THAT INFECTIONS OUT
HERE REALLY CAN BE DEADLY, THAT IT'S FOR-- FOR ALL THE JOKES OF
NAMING IT, THAT IT IS SERIOUS?
YEAH, I'VE GOT ONE, TOO.
I'VE GOT ONE, TOO.
Jeff: WHERE'S YOUR'S AUBRY?
INSIDE MY LEG.
ANOTHER MOUNTAIN.
Jeff: ANYBODY ELSE?
I HAVE TWO BIG ONES.
I STARTED GETTING A SCAB.
IT WAS SO RAW AND BURNED BUT THIS IS THE BEST I FEEL.
Jeff: JAISON, IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT REACHES CRITICAL MASS,
IF IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, YOU'RE NOT WORTHY.
IT'S TRUE.
THE ELEMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN EASIOUS, BUT WE'VE ALL KIND OF
SOLDIERED ON AND DEALT WITH IT, EMBRACED THE SUCK AND KEPT
GOING.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO KEEP GOING.
YES!
YES, WE ARE.
Jeff: IT IS TIME TO GET TO YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
FIRST THINGS, FIRST, DEBBIE, I'LL TAKE BACK TRIBAL IMMUNITY.
DONE WITH THIS.
GAME NOW SHIFTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL PORTION.
WHERE THIS IS WHAT YOU COVET.
OOH.
WOW.
Jeff: INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE YOUR SECURITY, YOU NEED THIS.
LET'S GET TO IT.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ON A LOG WHILE
BALANCING A BALL ON A WOODEN DISK.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, WE WILL ADD MORE BALLS, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT.
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF OF YOUR PERCH OR A BALL DROPS,
YOU'RE OUT.
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE
VOTE.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
AFTER 19 VERY TOUGH DAYS.
DRAW FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, STEP UP ON TO YOUR PERCH.
GET A GOOD FOOTING.
FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU WANT YOUR FEET TO GO, WHERE YOU FEEL MOST
SECURE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR FIRST BALL.
PLACE IT ON YOUR DISK.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
THREE, TWO, ONE, TAKE YOUR HANDS AWAY.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
OUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
IF AT ANY POINT YOUR HANDS TOUCH YOUR BALL, YOU'RE OUT.
IF YOUR BALL HITS THE GROUND, YOU'RE OUT.
IF YOU STEP OFF THE PERCH, YOU'RE OUT.
JOE, FIRST TO STEP OFF.
JOE IS OUT.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
WE'RE DOWN TO 10.
DEBBIE DROPS OUT.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
WE'RE DOWN TO NINE.
SCOT DOING A NICE JOB OF RECOVERING FROM AN EARLY WAVER.
BIG FEET.
HARD TO BALANCE ON THAT LITTLE LOG.
SOMETIMES BEING TALL IS AN ADVANTAGE, SOMETIMES NOT.
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT'S OKAY.
JUST STAY IN CONTROL OF IT.
THIS FIRST INTERVAL WILL BE FIVE MINUTES.
YOU'RE AT TWO MINUTES.
30 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
DON'T GET EXCITED.
JAISON CANNOT HANG IN.
10 SECONDS LEFT.
JAISON, THE THIRD PERSON OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
YOU'RE GOOD.
GET READY FOR ROUND TWO.
IT'S TIME TO ADD A SECOND BALL.
EVERYBODY PUT TWO BALLS ON YOUR DISK.
AND HERE WE GO IN THREE, TWO, ONE.
PULL YOUR HANDS AWAY.
WE ARE LIVE.
AND NOW IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT.
RIGHT AWAY A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
MICHELE IS OUT QUICKLY.
NEAL IS OUT.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
JUST LIKE THAT, SCOT DROPS OUT, AND WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
IN A MATTER OF 20 SECONDS IN THIS ROUND, THREE PEOPLE ARE
OUT.
CYDNEY'S OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
AUBRY IS OUT.
IT IS DOWN TO THREE ORIGINAL BEAUTY MEMBERS.
A LOT CHANGES AT THE MERGE.
OFTEN THE GAME IS REALLY UP IN THE AIR.
YOU WANT TO BE SAFE TONIGHT.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.
TAI'S BALLS BANGING INTO EACH OTHER, NEVER GOOD.
NICK WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
HIS BALLS DANCING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
BUT HE'S GOT THEM BACK STEADY AGAIN.
JULIA LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STEADY, LIKE A STATUE.
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY STEADY RIGHT NOW.
TWO MINUTES INTO THIS ROUND.
WE'LL GO FIVE MINUTES AGAIN BEFORE WE ADD ANOTHER BALL.
10 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
THIS ROUND IS OVER.
YOU'RE ALL SAFE.
NICE JOB!
( APPLAUSE ) NICE JOB, GUYS.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
TIME NOW TO ADD A THIRD BALL, AND WE WILL NOW GO UNTIL THE
END.
GET YOURSELF STEADY.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
REMOVE YOUR HANDS.
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.
EVERYBODY WITH THREE BALLS, RIGHT AWAY A LOT OF MOVEMENT FOR
NICK BUT A NICE RECOVER.
RIGHT BACK IN IT.
JULIA WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.
JULIA, THE MOST STEAD NETHIS CHALLENGE DROPS, LEAVING US WITH
A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN NICK AND TAI.
FOR IMMUNITY.
STARTED WITH 11.
NINE HAVE DROPPED.
NICK WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
A LOT OF MOVEMENT FROM TAI.
CAN HE RECOVER?
NO, TAI DROPS.
NICK WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GOOD JOB.
I WISH I COULD SEE YOU OVER THERE.
I WANTED TO LOOK.
GOOD JOB.
NICE JOB.
Jeff: NICK, COME ON OVER.
FIRST INDIVIDUAL WIN, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 19 CLEARLY DIFFICULT DAYS, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
IT WON'T BE YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
TONIGHT IT WILL BE THE FOUR BRAINS GOING UP AGAINST THE
BULLIES, AGAINST THE BRAWN.
FORTUNATELY, I HAVE THE IDOL, AND IF I THINK I NEED TO PLAY
IT, I'LL PLAY IT.
I COULD SAVE MYSELF OR MAY PASS IT ON TO AUBRY, AND HOPEFULLY
WE'LL TAKE CONTROL OF THIS GAME.
GOOD JOB, NICK!
GOOD JOB, NICK!
TONIGHT IS THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL AFTER THE MERGE.
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE OF WHERE THE DOMINOES WILL
FALL.
OR SO I BELIEVE.
IT'S BRAWN VERSUS BRAINS, AND I'M IN THE MIDDLE, ALONG WITH
BEAUTY, FOR THE MOST PART.
WE'RE LIKE THE PRETTY GIRL AT THE DANCE-- YOU'RE EITHER GOING
HOME WITH THE QUARTERBACK OR YOU'RE GOING HOME WITH THE
VALEDICTORIAN.
IT'S A FUN POSITION TO BE IN.
IT'S FUN BEING THE PRETTY GIRL.
I NEVER FELT LIKE A PRETTY GIRL BEFORE, BUT NOW I DO.
IT FEELS GREAT.
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
YEAH, EVERYBODY'S VOTING FOR AUBRY.
IT'S AN OBVIOUS SEVEN VERSUS FOUR.
OH, YEAH!
THE BRAINS ARE SCREWED.
WE'RE GOING TO JUST PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE UNTIL THEY'RE
GONE.
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS NEAL PLAYS AN IDOL BECAUSE HE'S
PARANOID, BUT OCTOBERRY GOES HOME ANYWAY.
WE'RE JUST GOING LEFT FIELD AND GETTING AUBRY OUT BECAUSE
THEY'LL NEVER SUSPECT IT.
I FEEL CONFIDENT IN OUR ALLIANCE OF BEAUTY AND BRAWN
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE EVERYBODY SEEMS TO FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
GOING, "HEY, WHY NOT?
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE BRAINS OUT."
AND ONCE WE GET TO SEVEN, THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, EVEN THOUGH
JASON AND I ALREADY HAVE IT FIGURED OUT.
AND WE GO UP FOUR SPOTS IN ABOUT A WEEK.
AND THEN WE JUST CHOP THEM DOWN ONE BY ONE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW I'M LEANING TOWARDS BRAWN AND VOTING OUT ONE OF THE
BRAINS RIGHT AWAY.
BUT SCOT AND JASON ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE OVER-CONFIDENT, AND
WHEN EVERYBODY FEELS SAFE IS WHEN YOU DO YOUR DAMAGE.
BECAUSE THE THING IS, IT'S LIKE THOSE THREE THEY'RE GOING
TO BE SUCH A DOMINANT FORTH PHYSICALLY.
OH, YEAH, THE THREE BRAWN.
SO THEY'RE JUST GOING TO USE THESE GIRLS FOR THEIR VOTES AND
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO DISPOSE OF THEM AND BE A TOP THREE.
YEAH, THEY'RE'S FIRM THREE.
WITH OUR GROUP, THERE'S A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING
SOME CHALLENGES.
IF WE HAVE THE SIX, WE'RE GOOD THEN.
SO I GET MICHELE.
NICK, I BELIEVE,MENTS TO GO WITH US.
SO NOW WE HAVE TO CONVINCE MICHELE TO COME ON BOARD.
WE NEED TO HAVE SIX, BUT IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION, ALL I
HAVE TO DO IS REACH THE FAMILY JEWELS RA& GRAB OUT IDOL.
I THINK MICHELE IS OUR BEST BET.
I'LL TALK TO MICHELE.
ANY CLUES TOO WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOBODY HAS REALLY APPROACHED ME ABOUT AISTITION.
THEN LET'S MAKE SOMETHING BETWEEN THE THREE OF US AND DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
WE'VE GOT TO PLAY THIS GAME.
I THINK THAT IT'S-- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?
JASON OR SCOT.
YEAH.
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS TONIGHT.
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE SCOT OR JASON OUT.
I AGREE.
TO GAIN POWER IN THIS GAME, THE BRAINS NEED NICK.
THE BRAINS NEED MICHELE.
I WANT A BRAWN GONE.
AND WE HAVE TO START MAKING STUFF HAPPEN.
THE BRAINS DON'T GET NICK AND MICHELE, NEAL AND I ARE PLAYING
THE IDOL.
THEY ARE SO TIGHT, THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER WAY TO BREAK
THEM UP.
AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TOWN ARE THE GAME.
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS FOR BEAUTY AND BRAIN TO,
LIKE, MELD AND MESS IT UP, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AS CONCRETE AS
THEM.
YEAH, I AGREE WITH THAT.
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH AUBRY AND DEBBIE, BUT I'M NOT
SURE STRATEGICALLY IT'S MY BEST OPTION.
I THINK I HAVE TO KIND OF ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIPS MORE.
I COULD GO WHICHEVER WAY I WANTED RIGHT NOW, SO I'M
FIGURING OUT WHAT IS BEST FOR ME.
SO THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.
YEAH.
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
JASON HAS PISSED ENOUGH PEOPLE OFF WHERE I DON'T THINK
THEY WOULD VOTE FOR HIM.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
SCOT, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM EITHER
BECAUSE HE HAS THE MONEY.
RIGHT.
SO THIS IS MY THINKING.
WE'RE GOING WITH BRAWN.
AGREED.
ING.
YEAH, SO WE'RE GOOD.
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH?
AUBRY.
IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH BRAWN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DO
BELIEVE I CAN MANIPULATE THEM JUST LIKE THAT.
AND BEAT THEM IN PUZZLES JUST LIKE THAT.
THEY'RE JUST IDIOTS.
I LIKE AUBRY.
I WOULD HANG OUT WITH AUBRY MORE THAN ANY OTHER GIRLS HERE.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, AUBRY'S GOING
HOME.
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TELL THE BRAINS, OKAY, YEAH, WE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SURPRISE THEM AT TRIBAL COUNCIL AND BE
LIKE WE'RE VOTING ONE OF YOU BRAINS OUT.
WE'RE IN THE SWING POSITION.
IT'S ALL WE CAN DO.
I KNOW HOW BIG OF A DECISION THIS IS.
I THINK I'M MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.
I'LL SEE WHEN THE GAME ENDS IF IT IS OR IT ISN'T.
SOUNDS GOOD.
GOOD.
UH-OH.
ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS?
NO, WHAT'S THIS?
JEFF'S HERE?
GETTING READY FOR TRIBAL TONIGHT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN JEFF
IS COMING.
THE DOCTOR IS COMING TO US.
IMMEDIATELY, RED FLAGS WENT UP.
JEFF DOESN'T DO THIS.
THE DOCTORS DON'T DO THIS. AT LEAST ONE OF US IS IN SERIOUS
ENOUGH CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD COME TO US.
THIS SEASON OF "SURVIVOR," IT'S TOUGH.
WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU MADE HOUSE CALLS.
Jeff: YOU KNOW, SO MANY OF YOU LOOKED SICK.
YOU UPON, AIRFARE SAW EVERYBODY TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, I WAS A
LITTLE CONCERNED.
SO I WANTED TO COME OUT WITH DR. RUPERT AND JUST KIND OF
ASSESS WHAT'S GOING ON.
WE JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF YOU THAT SHOWED US THE
INFECTIONS AND SEE WHERE WE'RE AT.
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS IT'S A REAL DEAL.
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN CONTAIN IT.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO START WITH?
START WITH TAI AND HIS THYSELF.
YEAH, I THINK I CLIMBED THE MAIPGO TREE, THAT LITTLE MANGO.
Jeff: YOU JUST GOT SCRAPED.
I COULDN'T MAKE IT AND SLID OUT AND SCRAPED.
Jeff: MAN!
IT WAS PAINFUL.
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING MY UNDERWEAR EVERY SINGLE
CHALLENGE.
Jeff: LET ME HAVE RUPERT TAKE A LOOK TAT.
I'VE GOT TO SAY THEY'RE HEALING UP REALLY NICELY.
Jeff: SO THAT'S GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT.
Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED BECAUSE YOU SEE SCABS FORMING.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND I CAN'T SEE ANY REDNESS OR SWELLING SO I THINK THESE ARE
REALLY GOOD.
I THINK THESE ARE HEALING.
Jeff: TAI, YOU'RE GOOD.
I'M FEELING GOOD.
Jeff: SCOT, YOU HAVE ONE.
I'VE GOT A COUPLE.
Jeff: OH, MAN!
IS IT PAINFUL?
A LITTLE BIT.
IT IS QUITE NEWSCASTLY INFECTED.
OUT HERE, SMALL CUTS TURN NASTY VERY QUICKLY.
Jeff: DO YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AT ALL?
WE'LL JUST KEEP AN EYE ON IT.
Jeff: OKAY.
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AUBRY?
YOU HAD A PRETTY GOOD ONE.
YEAH.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
OH, LOVELY.
Jeff: WOW!
MAN!
I CAN FEEL UNDERNEATH IT.
IT'S FIRM UP TO HERE.
Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING UNDERNEATH THERE IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S THAT BIG.
YEAH.
IT'S BRUTAL.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL OUT HERE.
AND A LITTLE THING BLOWS UP INTO A HUGE DEAL.
IF I LOSE AUBRY TO AN INJURY, THAT CHANGES THE WHOLE BALLGAME
HERE.
Jeff: SO, WALK ME THROUGH THIS.
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
YEAH, I'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS OUT HERE.
I COULD START HER ON SOME ANTIBIOTICS OR I COULD LANCE,
INCISE IT, DRAIN IT, IF I LANCE, THERE'S ROOM FOR THE PUS TO COME
OUT, BUT THERE'S ALSO ROOM FOR THE INFECTION TO GO IN.
Jeff: SO WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT?
MY GUT FEELING FOR THIS IS TO START HER ON ANTIBIOTICES.
Jeff: OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE CONSERVATIVE
APPROACH, AND IF IT GETS WORSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO STEP TWO.
EXACTLY.
Jeff: ANOTHER ALL RIGHT, AUBRY.
SO WE'LL GET AUBRY ON ANTIBIOTICS.
ALL RIGHT, NEAL.
OKAY.
MOUNT SAINT NEAL ACTUALLY BLEW ITS LID THIS AFTERNOON AND
A BIG CHUNK OF PUS CAME OUT AND REVEALED THIS GIANT CAVITY
THAT'S NOW KIND OF OPEN.
OKAY.
THAT'S NOT VERY PLEASANT.
AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING EVEN GROSS OR MY BACK.
IT DOESN'T HURT THOUGH.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
Jeff: WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER THE ONE ON YOUR BACK?
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
Jeff: YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE FIND A SPOT THAT'S CLEAN.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jeff: SO WE CAN SIT HIM DOWN IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT.
THE INFECTION ON MY BACK JUST LOOKS REALLY GROSS, BUT I THINK
IT WILL BE FINE.
IF MEDICAL TRIES TO PULL ME FROM THIS GAME, THEY ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO LITERALLY DRAG ME OUT OF HERE.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT ARE, SO LET'S JUST WALK THROUGH THESE.
HE'S GOT TWO INFECTIONS IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES.
TAKE US THROUGH WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE.
ABSOLUTELY.
I FEEL GOOD, THOUGH.
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, LAST NIGHT.
GOT EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP.
Jeff: YEAH?
AND WE HAD A FEAST RECENTLY.
I'M GOING TO WIN SOME REWARD TOMORROW.
I MEAN, I'M LOOKING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT COULD
POTENTIALLY BECOME.
AND THAT ONE IS IN THE SKIN, BUT THERE'S NOTHING UNDER THERE I
THINK WILL IMMEDIATELY BE DAMAGED.
Jeff: SO ASSESSMENT ON THIS IS WHAT?
IT'S A BIG, NASTY SPOT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S LIFE
THREATENING.
I THINK HE'S OUT.
YOU THINK?
NO.
THAT'S WAY I'M LEANING.
I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.
Jeff: ANOTHER SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.
I'M LESS WORRIED ABOUT THAT ONE.
Jeff: OKAY, LET'S SPIN BACK AROUND.
AND WALK ME THROUGH THE KNEE AND LET'S SEE WHERE WE'RE AT.
AND BEING CLOSE TO A JOINT LIKE THE KNEE, IS THAT MORE SERIOUS?
CORRECT.
IF THE INJECTION GOES INTO THE JOINT, AN INFECTION IN A JOINT
CAN DESTROY IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
Jeff: HOURS?
YES.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
I TRULY BELIEVE THIS WILL BE FINE IN A FEW DAYS.
Jeff: I BELIEVE YOU BELIEVE THAT.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IF THAT GETS WORSE AND IT GOES INTO YOUR
JOINT, THIS IS FOR LIFE.
YOU KNOW, THESE CAN AFFECT YOU YEARS DOWN THE LINE.
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO RUN AROUND AND DO THIS WHEN YOU'RE
JOE'S AGE.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS.
I THINK THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GET WORSE.
I LOVE THIS GAME, JEFF.
Jeff: NEAL, I CAN SEE YOU ALREADY GETTING EMOTIONAL.
SENSING WHAT HE'S SAYING.
SO, DR. RUPERT, LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR.
ARE YOU PULLING NEAL FROM THE GAME?
I THINK I HAVE TO.
Jeff: YOU FOUGHT HARD.
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.
YOU JUST PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO IT.
SO WHAT'S THE FEELING?
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAN.
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL TO BE OUT HERE.
A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK TO COME OUT HERE.
WATCHING THE SHOW IN THE SUMMER OF 2000, I WAS WORKING IN A
CUBICLE.
I WAS THOROUGHLY UNINTERESTING.
I DIDN'T LOVE MY LIFE.
SO I'VE HAD QUITE THE JOURNEY, JUST LIKE YOU HAVE OVER THE LAST
15 YEARS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I CAN NOT ONLY COME OUT TO
"SURVIVOR," BUT I COULD REALLY COMPETE.
BUT IT'S BEEN A GREAT 19 DAYS.
Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM HERE, GET YOU INTO A
PROPER HOSPITAL.
WE'LL GET THIS FIXED.
YOU COME BACK, YOU'RE A JURY MEMBER.
YOU WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN, BUT YOU WILL HAVE A VOTE TO
DECIDE WHO DOES WIN.
SO I'M GUESSING YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
EVERYBODY.
YES.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY, BECAUSE
THEY'RE PULLING ME FROM THE GAME.
SO IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY WITH EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.
I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW IT TOOK EVERYTHING WITHIN NEAL NOT TO GET UPSET BECAUSE HE
WANTS TO PLAY SO BADLY.
AND HE JUST TOLD US HOW LUCKY WE WERE TO BE HERE.
AND HE'S RIGHT.
BUT, LIKE, REALLY SIGNAL MY NUMBER ONE ALLY.
GONE.
BE WELL.
SO NEAL'S GOING, AND IT'S ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE WHAT ABOUT
THE IDOL?
AND I'M JUST HOPING HE WOULD GIVE MEET IDOL.
Jeff: SO, NEAL'S BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
NOBODY FROM THIS GROUP GOING HOME.
ONE IN 10 SHOT AT THE GAME.
19 DAYS IN.
ONCE AGAIN, THE GAME HAS CHANGED.
I FEEL BAD.
AUBRY WAS GOING HOME, AND THANKS TO SOME LUCKY MEDICAL
EVACUATION, SHE LIVES FOR MAYBE ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.
Jeff: TRY TO STAY HEALTHY.
KEEP YOUR WOUNDS CLEAN.
AND I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK?
I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE CRYING THIS MUCH ON "SURVIVOR."
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS AND RIGHT WHEN I THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET SOME TRACTION UNDER US, MY BIGGEST
ALLY IS OUT OF THE GAME.
I GOT A NICE LITTLE BULGE ON MY LEG THAT EVERYONE GOT TO SEE.
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, WITH NEAL GONE, THERE IS NO WAY THE
BEAUTIES JOIN THE BRAIN AND THE IDOL WENT HOME WITH NEAL.
THAT SON OF A BITCH.
REALLY, NEAL LEFT ME HANGING.
BUT "SURVIVOR" IS A PATH.
YOU PAVE YOUR WAY BY YOURSELF.
IT'S LIKE GOING ON THE OREGON TRAIL.
YOU HAVE TO FORD EVERY RIVER.
YOU HAVE TO CAULK EVERY WAG PON YOU HAVE TO GO UP THE HILLS AND
DOWN THE HILLS, AND SOMETIMES YOU GET DYSENTERY AND DIE.
YOU HAVE TO PAVE YOUR OWN WAY.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON "SURVIVOR," THE BRAINS ARE ON
THE OUTS AND HOPING FOR A MIRACLE.
THE JOCKS AND THE PRET PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO SIT PRETTY
FOREVER.
IST WANT US TO BE CAREFUL.
PARANOIA IS GOING TO KICK IN AT A CERTAIN POINT.
Jeff: IT ALL STARTS TO CRUMBLE.
IRRITATED CYDNEY WILL BLOW THE WHOLE GAME UP.
I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT TRULY BELIEVES THE JOURNEY IS
THE REWARD, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL
HOLD NEAR AND DEAR AND LOOK BACK WITH MANY SMILES AND MANY
LAUGHS, MAYBE A TEAR OR TWO, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
BUT THAT'S THE GAME.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST OUTWIT AND OUTPLAY.
YOU HAVE TO OUTLAST.
