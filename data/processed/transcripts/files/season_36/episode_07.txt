        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER A SURPRISE
SWITCH -- DROP YOUR BUFFS --
DOMENICK WAS FREE OF HIS BIGGEST
ENEMY.
CHRIS WAS STILL AFTER ME, SO
GETTING AWAY FROM HIM WAS SUCH A
RELIEF.
Jeff: AND HE WAS ARMED WITH
A REAL IDOL.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: FAKE IDOL.
SICK.
Jeff: AND LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
YOU MAY ONLY USE IT WHEN
THERE ARE 13 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE








GAME OR WHEN THERE ARE ONLY SIX
PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME.
Jeff: DOMENICK WAS ALSO IN
CONTROL OF THE VOTE.
I HAVE THE CHOICE OF TAKING
OUT LIBBY OR BRADLEY.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DOMENICK MADE HIS DECISION AND
BROKE TRIBAL LINES.
Jeff: BRADLEY, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
13 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
Captioning funded by CBS
THIS MORNING WE GET THIS
NOTE, AND IT SAYS THAT WE'VE
MADE IT TO THE NEXT PART OF THE
GAME, AND IT'S THE MERGE.
TO MAKE IT TO THE POINT WHERE
YOU ALL GET TO BE ON ONE BEACH
AND IT BECOMES A INDIVIDUAL GAME
FEELS LIKE SUCH AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.








NOW THE WORK I PUT IN TO BUILD
RELATIONSHIPS DURING THE SWAP IS
GOING TO PAY OFF, SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE I CAN
DO.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, MY GOD.
WELCOME.
AS SOON AS I SAW EVERYONE
PULL NEW YORK I WAS HAPPY TO SEE
MY BOY WENDELL.
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE TO
TALK TO THAT'S REASONABLE AND
INTELLIGENT.
AND THEN THERE'S CHRIS, MY
NUMBER-ONE NEMESIS OUT HERE.
THIS GUY JUST WON'T GO AWAY, BUT
I'M HOPING THAT HE'S NOT LOOKING
TO CUT MY THROAT AT THIS POINT
IN THE GAME.
GATHER, EVERYONE, ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND.
A CELEBRATION AWAITS.
THE MERGE!
LET'S GO EAT.
THIS STAGE IN THE GAME
REPRESENTS, YOU KNOW, HOPE THAT
I CAN WIN THIS THING.
TO BE 18, WANTING TO BE THE
YOUNGEST SURVIVOR EVER, IT'S
BEEN HARD FOR ME SO FAR, SO TO
NOT ONLY MAKE IT TO THE MERGE,
BUT TO HAVE AN IDOL, IT'S LIKE
CHRISTMAS MORNING FOR ME.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, YEAH.
I KNOW ALL HELL IS ABOUT THE
BREAK LOOSE, BUT IN MY MIND
RIGHT NOW IT'S AN EVEN PLAYING
FIELD.
THANK YOU, SURVIVOR GODS!
EVERYONE GETS RANDOM SEAT AT
THE TABLE.
AT EACH SPOT THERE IS A BLACK
BUFF.
WE ARE ONE FAMILY, BUT AFTER THE
FEAST IS OVER, OUR NEXT ACCEPT
IS TO START EATING EACH OTHER.
I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.
I'VE BEEN AT HOTEL NAVITI SINCE
DAY ONE.
I CHERISH THE NEW RELATIONSHIPS
I'VE BUILT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
I HOPE TO STRENGTHEN SOME OF THE
OLD RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAYBE
WEREN'T AS STRONG AS THEY COULD
BE, SO PLAY YOU HEART OUT.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS, GUY,
RIGHT?
SALUDE.
I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR MY SECOND
HALF OF THIS GAME.
IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE OPTIONS.
I HAVE A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE WITH
DONATHAN, WENDELL, LAUREL, AND
MYSELF.
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
IN ADDITION TO, THAT I CAN
STICK WITH NAVITI ORIGINALS AND
HAVE THE MAJORITY, BUT CHRIS IS
SUCH A WILD CARD.
LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO BE RICH.
DON'T MAKE IT CHEAPER, LIKE
LeBRON IN THE FINALS I WON'T
TAKE A BREATHER.
HE'S STILL A PAIN IN MY ASS.
I'M SORRY.
SO IF I CAN GET CHRIS OFF MY
BACK, THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO DO THE WHOLE TIME
SINCE I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, THAT
WOULD BE A HUGE WEIGHT OFF MY
SHOULDERS.
I FEEL AWFUL RIGHT NOW.
I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK TO MY
ORIGINAL WEIGHT.
I'M SITTING IN THE SHELTER,
AND I ATE SO MUCH THAT I CAN
BARELY EVEN MOVE.
I CAN BARELY EVEN TALK.
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M FIXING MY
BUFF, AND IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.
IT FELT WEIRD.
I WAS LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE.
SO I OPENED MY BUFF, AND IT
SAYS, "SHHH, A SECRET AWAITS AT
TREE MAIL."
SO I'M FREAKING OUT INSIDE.
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
ANYONE COULD HAVE SAT DOWN AND
GOT THIS BUFF.
I JUST FEEL VERY BLESSED.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE DOCTOR
ORDERED.
NOW THAT WE'VE REACHED THE
MERGE, SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO IS
ATHLETIC AND GOOD AT CHALLENGES,
WILL BE FIRST ONE TARGETED.
I HAVE TO BE SMART.
I GOT TO DO THIS WHEN NO ONE IS
WATCHING.
"CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOUND A CLUE TO THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, GOOD AT
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL AND
PROBABLY MORE.
BUT THERE IS A CATCH.
THE ISLAND IS AT GOES ISLAND.
TONIGHT A BOAT WILL ARRIVE TO
SNEAK YOU OFF THE ISLAND.
ARE YOU WILLING TO RISK GETTING
CAUGHT?
DAMN RIGHT I AM.
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE GOT PLACES
BECAUSE I TOOK RISKS.
WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE YOU
HAVE TO GO ALL IN, ESPECIALLY IF
YOU'RE A SERIOUS THREAT, LIKE I
AM.
AT THE SAME TIME, CAN I GET AWAY
WITH IT?
IT IS A HUGE RISK FOR LEAVING
THE ISLAND FOR MULTIPLE HOURS IN
THE NIGHT.
IF I GET CAUGHT AND PEOPLE WANT
TO QUESTION ME, I AM SCREWED.
SO RIGHT NOW IT'S NAVITI AND
MALOLO.
BUT CAN WE STAY NAVITI
STRONG?
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS CHRIS,
IF WE CAN WORK IT OUT WITH HIM,
I DON'T KNOW.
I WOULD LIKE THE SIT YOU
DOWN, BE A MEDIATOR, CLEAR THE
AIR.
ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN DO IT
FOR ONE VOTE.
IS THERE SOMEONE THAT WE
COULD JUST AGREE ON OFF OF
MALOLO FOR OUR FIRST VOTE.
I THINK WE COULD AGREE ON
MICHAEL OR LIBBY.
AT LEAST FOR THIS VOTE, I
WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO BE EASY
PEASEY NAVITI AND US TO JUST GET
OUT MICHAEL OR LIBBY.
PROBLEM IS CHRIS AND DOMENICK,
IT'S LIKE THE COLD WAR.
IT'S LIKE AN ARMS RACE, AND
THESE TWO GUYS CAN BLOW UP THE
WORLD IF THEY WANT.
I JUST WANTED TO HOLLER AT YOU
AND DOM TOGETHER TO SEE IF WE
COULD HAVE A COLLECTIVE ENEMY
AND JUST GO FOR SOMEBODY.
I LIKE DOM.
HE'S MY GUY IN THIS, AND MAYBE I
CAN BE THAT LITTLE BRIDGE,
SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, OR MAYBE I'LL
LEARN, THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE, AND
WE HAVE TO GO THE NUCLEAR
OPTION.
DOM, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
TALK ABOUT?
WELL, I THINK THROUGHOUT OUR
TIME HERE, I THINK THIS WHOLE
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
STARTED DAY ONE.
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BECAUSE I
THINK THE THREE OF US ESPECIALLY
COULD HAVE REALLY PUT OUR HEADS
TOGETHER AND, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I'LL EVEN TEMPORARILY WORK
TOGETHER AND WE COULD KILL EACH
OTHER LATER FOR ALL I CARE, BUT
OUT OF THE GREAT, IT'S
IMPORTANT, CHRIS.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO
PROTECT EACH OTHER AND GET
SOMEBODY OUT OF HERE --
 I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND ON
ANYTHING THAT I'M GOING TO DO.
WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE SITTING
OVER THERE.
WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO ANY ONE
OF THOSE THREE?
TO ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE?
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME?
I JUST POINTED AT THREE
PEOPLE SITTING ON THE BEACH.
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY
YES TO ANY OF THEM...
I CAN'T SAY YES TO ANYBODY
RIGHT NOW.
THEN WE CAN'T COME TO AN
AGREEMENT.
DOMENICK AND WENDELL WERE
PITCHING ME B.S.
I'M TOO SUAVE TO JUST BUY IT.
THEY WANT TO MAKE ME THEIR
FRIEND SO THEY CAN SLASH ME.
DID YOU BRING ME A CUP?
WE'RE CRACKING OVER THE WINE.
LET'S GO.
I LEFT THAT CONVERSATION
EXACTLY HOW I FELT GOING IN.
THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH TURBULENCE
WITH DOM AND I.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I NEED
TO ELIMINATE MY BIGGEST THREAT.
I KNEW THIS WOULD BE TEN
MINUTES OF NONSENSE.
THAT'S FINE.
WE'LL SEND HIM FOR AN UNTIMELY
DEPARTURE.
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.
THE PEACE TALKS CAME TO AN
ABRUPT HALL.
I WAS WILLING TO COLLABORATE
WITH CHRIS, BUT THE GLOVES ARE
OFF.
TIME TO GO TO WAR WITH YOU.
SEASON 36.
Jeff:
 DOMENICK AND WENDELL WANT ME
OUT.
THE ONLY TRUE SAFETY NET FOR ME
IS THE IDOL.
THAT'S AT GHOST ISLAND.
IT'S SUPER POSH -- IMPORTANT
THAT I SNEAK AWAY AND NOT GET
CAUGHT.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
EVERYONE IS KNOCKED OUT.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE MY MOVE NOW.
I HAD MY SHOES ON.
I AM STRAPPED UP READY TO ROCK.
I GOT TO BE SMART.
I GOT TO DO THIS IN A STEALTHY
FASHION.
I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS,
LUCKILY I GOT OUT UNSCATHED.
I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M PRETTY
CLUTCH ACTUALLY.
YOU KNOW, GHOST ISLAND IS
NOTHING NEW TO ME.
I'VE BEEN, THERE BUT I'VE NEVER
ARRIVED THERE AT NIGHT.
YOU KNOW, FOLLOWING THOSE
TORCHES IS SORT OF SCARY.
IT'S SORT OF FREAKY.
BUT I'M READY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S
IN MY DESTINY.
THIS IS J.T.'S AUTHENTIC HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL FROM SURVIVOR:
GAME CHANGE CENTERS 2017.
YES.
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
THAT IDOL WILL KEEP ME IN THIS
GAME.
HE LEFT THIS IDOL BACK AT
CAMP AS HE HEADED TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
IT WAS BAD DECISION.
DAMN.
HE WAS BLIND SIDED THAT
NIGHT.
I MADE A VERY, VERY FOOLISH
MISTAKE.
I GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT IN
MYSELF.
Reporter: THIS TAINTED IDOL
HAS LOST SOME OF ITS POTENT
SIMILAR IT IS GOOD ONLY AT THE
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THAT'S CRAZY.
MOST HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS ONCE
YOU GET IT, THEY'RE GOOD FOREVER
UNTIL YOU USE IT, BUT THIS ONE
IS ONLY GOOD AT THE NEXT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND THEN I START USING
SOMETHING ELSE.
J.T.'S IDOL IS YOURS AND NOT AT
RISK, BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO
WAGER YOUR VOTE AT NEXT TRIAL
COUNCIL, YOU CAN INCREASE THE
POWER.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M INTRIGUED.
EACH TIME YOU CHOOSE THE CORRECT
BAMBOO, YOU EXTEND THE LIFE OF
THIS IDOL BY ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU CAN DO THIS UP TO FIVE TIMES
OR UNTIL YOU LOSE YOUR VOTE.
ALL RIGHT.
SO THE GAME'S GOT TEN SLOTS,
FIVE ON EACH SIDE.
IT'S A 50/50 SHOT ON EACH ONE.
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
EXTEND THE SHELF LIFE OF THIS
IDOL IF I'M LUCKY.
HERE'S THE CATCH, IT'S ALSO
POSSIBLE IF I PLAY THIS GAME
THAT I CAN'T VOTE AT THE NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THAT'S CRUCIAL, BECAUSE I'M
TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE GETTING
RID OF DOM.
IT'S A RISK-REWARD TYPE DEAL.
I AM DEFINITELY GOING FOR IT.
IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS GAME THE
TAKE RISKS, BECAUSE IT'S THE
ONLY WAY YOU MAKE IT TO THE END.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
NUMBER ONE.
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT BUILT TO
COAST.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR IDOL HAS INCREASED IN
POWER.
HELL, YEAH.
YOUR IDOL IS NOW GOOD IN EITHER
ONE OF THE NEXT TWO TRIBAL
COUNCILS.
WANT TO ASK YOUR VOTE AGAIN?
YOU BET YOUR ASS.
LET'S KEEP THIS GOING.
I NEED AS MUCH POWER AS POSSIBLE
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN IN THIS
GAME.
NO VOTE.
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
NO VOTE.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO VOTE
THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT I HAVE
THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THAT'S GOOD FOR ONE OF THE NEXT
TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS.
THANK YOU "SURVIVOR" GODS.
J.T. GOT COCKY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY WHO
GOT SENT HOME WHO HAS AN IDOL
AND DIDN'T USE IT.
I WILL HAVE IT IN MY POCKET AND
READY TO ROCK.
HOW'S THAT COFFEE COMING?
HE'S OVER THERE WORKING HARD.
CHRIS IS CRANKY AND TIRED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH HIM, BUT HE HAS NO
PROBLEM DISHING ORDERS OUT THE
PEOPLE WHILE HE RESTS AND GETS
HIS BEAUTY SLEEP.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT I
JUST DON'T GET ABOUT HIM, AND
THEY IRK ME, AND, OH, LET'S
REMEMBER, HE'S STILL AFTER ME.
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO HEAR.
I COULD CARE LESS IF HE'S THE
GREATEST GUY IN THE WORLD.
THE SON OF A BITCH WANTS ME
DEAD.
HE'S GOT TO GO.
THE DOM AND CHRIS WAR IS
GOING TO GO ON UNTIL WHICHEVER.
IT'S GOING TO END REAL SOON.
ONE OF US IS GOING HOME REAL
SOON.
DON'T WORRY.
WE NEED TO EXTINGUISH THE
IDOL.
I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS THE
IDOL.
DOM DOES.
HE SHOWED ME IT.
HE SHOWED YOU IT?
I MADE THE CHEESIEST FAKE
IDOL YOU CAN IMAGINE.
SO IN HIS MIND UNLESS ANYONE HAS
TOLD HIM, CHRIS, IT'S FAKE, HE
STILL BELIEVES I HAVE AN ACTUAL
IDOL.
I DO HAVE AN ACTUAL IDOL, AND MY
LEGACY ADVANTAGE, PLUS I ALSO
HAVE THE FAKE IDOL.
EVEN THOUGH MICHELE ON A STRING
IS KIND OF A JOKE, CHRIS
BELIEVES IT'S REAL.
ARE YOU SURE HE HAS THE IDOL?
WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE SO
EASILY --
NO, NO, NO, EVEN IF HE DOES,
THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF IT IS
TO BLINDSIDE HIM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
I TRIED BLIND SIDING HIM TWICE.
THEN WE KEPT WINNING.
I WAS ON GHOST ISLAND THE ONE
TIME WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT.
DOM AND CHRIS HAVE BEEN
BEEFING SINCE DAY ONE.
THE MERGE BEECH IS NOT BIG
ENOUGH FOR THE BETH OF THEM.
AS SOON AS ONE OF THEM LEAVES
THE ROOM, THEY TALK ABOUT EACH
OTHER TO WHOEVER IS AROUND.
HE'S A LOSER.
HE'S AN IDIOT.
HE'S A JOKE BECAUSE SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT COME OUT OF HIS
MOUTH ARE SO RIDICULOUS.
I WOULD LOVE TO COMPARE
MYSELF TO THE DWYANE WADES.
I STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM AND
NOW I'M HERE.
CHRIS HAS THE SHOW THE WORLD
HOW GREAT HE IS.
LIFE IS FULL OF
OPPORTUNITIES.
LIKE D-WADE IN HIS PRIME, I'M
JUMPING ON IT WITH TWO FRESH
KNEES.
IT'S GETTING OLD.
SAME PAGE, DOM.
GOOD TALK, GIRLS.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHERE ARE YOU AT ON THIS
DOM-CHRIS THING?
THE ONLY THING WITH CHRIS IS
HE IS A BIG TARGET, BUT THEN
ALSO CHRIS I DON'T FEEL LIKE
HE'S REALLY GOING TO LIE.
LIKE DOM.
CHRIS, YOU COULD ASK HIM
SOMETHING.
WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU, HE'S
PROBABLY GOING TO DO IT.
HE'S LOYAL.
OKAY.
BUT DOM, HE'S SO DANGEROUS.
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
NEED OUR NUMBERS, SO I THINK
WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION.
I DO, TOO.
PERFECT DAY TODAY.
DOM AND CHRIS HAVE BEEN AT WAR
WITH EACH OTHER, TAKING THE
ATTENTION OFF OF ME AND MICHAEL
AND LIBBEY.
IT'S AMAZING.
I HAVE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM SO
MUCH, NOW THAT I'M IN MORE OF A
POWERFUL POSITION, IT FEELS GOOD
TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF
THE CONTROL AND POWER RIGHT NOW.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
OH, YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAKE BACK TRIBAL IMMUNITY.
THANK YOU, KELLYN.
THANK YOU, DOMENICK.
TRIBAL IMMUNITY NO MORE.
THIS IS NOW WHAT YOU COVET.
NICE.
Jeff: INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK, YOU
ARE SAFE AT TRIBAL.
WITHOUT IT YOU ARE NOT.
SHALL WE GET TO YOUR FIRST
CHALLENGE?
YES.
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ON NARROW
BEAM WHILE BALANCING A STATUE ON
A LONG POLE OVER YOUR HEAD.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU'LL MOVE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM, MAKING IT
MORE DIFFICULT.
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF OR
YOUR STATUE DROP, YOU'RE OUT OF
THE CHALLENGE.
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING
WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE
VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY'S IN POSITION.
RAISE YOUR POLES ABOVE YOUR
HEAD.
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, AND IT IS ALREADY
BURNING.
AS YOU TRY TO BALANCE ON A BEAM
WHILE BALANCING A POLE WITH A
STATUE AT THE END AND A MILLION
DOLLARS ON THE LINE.
ALREADY A LITTLE MOVEMENT FROM
JENNA.
JENNA IS FIRST OUT.
SET YOUR POLE DOWN, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE SITOUT BENCH.
DONATHAN DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.
DAWN IS OUT.
-- DONATHAN IS OUT THAT.
IS HOW QUICKLY IT CAN HAPPEN.
HERE COMES THE WIND.
DESIREE IS OUT.
MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS AN OBSTACLE
ON "SURVIVOR."
ANGELA DROPS.
ANGELA IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO NINE.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WIGGLE ROOM
WITH THIS.
YOU'LL GO IN THIS FIRST SECTION
FOR FIVE MINUTES.
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM, AND IT'S
GOING TO GET MORE DIFFICULT.
IT IS TIME NOW TO TRANSITION
INTO THAT NEXT SECTION.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION
OR YOU'RE OUT.
YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO GET
THERE.
YOU JUST NEED TO BE THINKING,
HOW DO I MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE
WHILE MOVING FURTHER DOWN THE
BEAM, KNOWING IT'S GOING TO GET
MORE NARROW.
EVERYBODY HAS SUCCESSFULLY MOVED
INTO THAT SECOND SECTION.
NICE JOB.
THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES.
SEBASTIAN DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
THERE IS NO CERTAINTY AT TRIBAL
EVER, ESPECIALLY AT THE MERGE.
THE ONLY THING THAT IS CERTAIN
IS WHEN YOU HAVE IMMUNITY AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME NOW TO START MOVING
INTO THAT LAST SECTION.
YOU NEED TO GET PART OF YOUR
FOOT IN THREAD PAINT AT THE VERY
END OF THE BEAM WHERE IT'S VERY
NARROW.
I'LL GIVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME.
CHELSEA, YOU'RE THERE.
KELLYN, YOU'RE JUST AN INCH
AWAY.
DOMENICK CAN'T MAKE THE
TRANSITION.
DOMENICK IS OUT.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
EVERYBODY ELSE CONTINUES TO MAKE
THE TRANSITION.
YOU GOT 30 SECONDS TO GET THERE.
YOU'RE GOOD, KELLYN.
MICHAEL CANNOT MAKE THE
TRANSITION.
HE'S OUT.
CHRIS CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSITION.
CHRIS IS OUT.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
LAUREL DROPS.
WENDELL, YOU GOT TO GET THERE.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
WENDELL CAN'T MAKE THE
TRANSITION AND WENDELL IS OUT.
THAT GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE PEOPLE,
KELLYN, CHELSEA, AND LIBBY
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.
22 DAYS IN, FIRST CHALLENGE FOR
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, THREE WOMEN
SHOWING EVERYBODY ELSE HOW IT'S
DONE.
THE WIND IS MOVING THOSE STATUES
A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S FORCING YOU TO WORK EVEN
HARDER TO KEEP IT STEADY.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT FOR
CHELSEA.
NICE RECOVERY.
LOCKED IN.
Jeff: COME ON, CHELSEA.
CHELSEA DROPS, CHELSEA IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.
IT IS A SHOWDOWN, KELLYN VERSUS
LIBBY, FOR IMMUNITY.
RIGHT HERE.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT FROM
BOTH WOMEN, THEIR STATUES.
LIBBY IS GETTING A LITTLE
WOBBLY.
KELLYN IS, TOO.
HERE COMES THAT WIND AGAIN.
MOVING THOSE STATUES, REMINDING
YOU TO STAY FOCUSED.
THE FLAGS ARE BLOWING.
MORE WIND.
MORE WOBBLING.
LIBBY OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS.
KELLYN WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
SAFE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU GOT IT, GIRL!
YOU WON FIRST ONE.
KELLYN!
BEAST MODE.
BEAST MODE.
Jeff: KELLYN, COME ON OVER.
GREAT JOB, KEL.
Jeff: KELLYN, SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
CAN NOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 22
DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED THE
EIGHTH PERSON OUT.
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
MISS KELLYN CAME HOME WITH
THE TROPHY, AND I CANNOT BELIEVE
IT.
IT'S NOT ME GOING HOME TONIGHT,
BUT I'M STILL VERY NERVOUS ABOUT
THIS VOTE BECAUSE DOM AND CHRIS
NOBLE HAVE BEEN AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS.
THIS IS THE TRIBAL WHERE FINALLY
LAWNS ARE TRULY DRAWN IN THE
SAND.
(TYPING SOUND)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
GOOD JOB, KELLYN.
GOOD JOB.
THAT WAS AWESOME.
KELLYN WON.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER, BUT SINCE
I DON'T HAVE THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE, I NEED TO STRATEGIZE
AND MAKE PLAN.
SO ARE WE JUST GOING TO SIT HERE
AND BE AWKWARD, OR ARE WE GOING
TO START PLAYING THE GAME?
I NEED TO GET WATER.
DES, YOU COMING?
MICHAEL, READY TO ROCK?
I DECIDED TO TAKE EVERYONE
OTHER THAN DOMENICK AND WENDELL
TO THE WELL.
SO I GOT A QUESTION.
WHAT IS EVERYONE THINKING?
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED WITH SOME
PEOPLE AND THERE IS AN ADOLL OUT
THERE.
WE COULD GET A SPLIT VOTE IF
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS WOULD
BE OPEN TO.
DOM AND WENDELL, THEY WANTED TO
GET LIBBY OUT.
I THINK IT JUST WOULD BE BEST
FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE IF WE KID
THAT.
AND I WANT EVERYONE MAYBE TO BE
ON THAT PAGE.
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?
I THINK WE'RE OBVIOUSLY OPEN.
WE NEED TO FLUSH THE IDOL.
IT'S PERSONAL FOR ME.
DOM JUST NEEDS TO GO HOME.
THE ISSUE IS I DON'T HAVE A
VOTE.
SO I MAKE THIS FOOL-PROOF PLAN.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
IF DOM PLAYS THE IDOL, WENDELL
GOES HOME.
IF DOM DOESN'T, HE GOES HOME.
HOW IS THAT NOT A GREAT DEAL FOR
EVERYBODY?
IT'S FLUSHING AN IDOL AND --
 YOU THINK ONE OF THEM HAS IT?
DOM DOES HAVE IT.
CHRIS'S PLAN MAKES PERFECT
SENSE.
DOMENICK AND WENDELL ARE A
DANGEROUS PAIR.
THEY'RE BOTH SMART GUYS, AND
THEY'RE DEFINITELY THREATS TO
ME.
BUT IS THIS LEGIT?
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO
BELIEVE, WHETHER COME MAY HAVE
ONE OR WHETHER CHRIS JUST MAKING
IT UP TO PUT A TARGET ON
DOMENICK'S BACK.
TRUTH WILL TELL AT TRIBAL, WHERE
PEOPLE STAND.
IN THE EVENT THINGS GO CRAZY,
I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO PLAY MY
IDOL.
HIT ME.
I THINK EVERYONE JUST
SCATTERED.
I WANT TO GET CHRIS OUT.
HE'S CAUSING CRAP.
HE HAS TO GO HOME.
GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE.
WHEN WE CAME BACK FROM
IMMUNITY, CHRIS BRINGS EVERYONE
TO THE WATER WELL EXCEPT FOR DOM
AND MYSELF.
IT'S LIKE, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,
DUDE.
THIS EGO OF CHRIS'S IS
RIDICULOUS AND OUT OF HAND, AND
HE HAS TO GO.
SO WHY DON'T WE LINE UP AGAINST
HIM AND SEE WHO IS NOT WITH US.
IF WE CAN PUT TOGETHER MY
BOY.
LISTEN TO ME.
I HAVE AN IDOL.
YOU DO?
GOOD, GOOD.
IF YOU WANT TO STAY --
 I'M WILLING TO LET THAT THING
GO TODAY.
LET'S DO THIS, MAN.
BECAUSE OF THE WAY CHRIS
TALKS TO PEOPLE, IT'S HARD FOR
ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE COULD GET
ENOUGH PEOPLE ON BOARD TO VOTE
ME OR DOMENICK OUT, SO MAYBE I
DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THIS IDOL
THAT'S BEEN IN MY POCKET, BUT IF
I FEEL THREATENED, I'LL PULL OUT
THE IDOL AND USE IT AND BUY
MYSELF A COUPLE MORE DAYS.
WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTES.
YOU AND WENDELL.
IF WE CAN GET TOGETHER, WE CAN
PUT FIVE ON CHRIS.
ABSOLUTELY 100% VOTE CHRIS.
OKAY.
RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST THE FOUR OF
US, BUT LIBBY AND JENNA WANT TO
JOIN US FOR THIS VOTE.
THEY WANT CHRIS OUT.
I KNOW, BUT -- I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHO TO TRUST OUT HERE.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS MIGHT
BE SPLITTING VOTES ON ME AND
DOM.
IT'S AN OPTION.
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD
BE A DICTATORSHIP.
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A DEMOCRACY.
ON EVERYTHING HOLY, I WILL VOTE
FOR CHRIS TONIGHT AND WE CAN GET
THIS GUY OUT OF HERE AND WE CAN
LIVE LIKE CIVILIZED HUMAN
BEINGS.
THERE IS A WAR GOING ON
TONIGHT.
AND PEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT
SIDE THEY WANT TO BE ON.
CHRIS'S SIDE OR DOM'S SIDE.
GUYS, THE WRITING IS ON THE
WALL.
PICKING A SIDE IS REALLY
TOUGH, BUT IT FEELS REALLY GOOD
TO BE SAFE TONIGHT.
HONESTLY.
SO WHAT'S YOUR GUYS OUTLOOK
ON EVERYTHING?
ARE THE BOYS JUST GOING AT
EACH OTHER?
YEAH.
WELL, IF THE FOUR OF US
NAVITI GIRLS ALL VOTE TOGETHER,
WE COULD GET ONE MORE MALOLO
OUT.
SO WHO WOULD YOU GO FOR?
I THINK IT WOULD BE LIBBY,
BECAUSE MICHAEL IS AN OBVIOUS
THREAT, LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO ANY CONVINCING TO SAY MICHAEL
SHOULD GO HOME.
WITH LIBBY YOU DO.
AND SHE CAN MAKE CONNECTIONS
WITH PEOPLE AND STAY UNDER THE
RADAR.
THERE IS DEFINITELY A WAR
GOING ON AROUND HERE.
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO ME.
BECAUSE THEN THEY LOSE SIGHT OF
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
WITH EVERYBODY SPLITTING VOTES
BETWEEN COME, WENDELL AND CHRIS,
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI GIRLS CAN
SLIP THIS TO GET WHO I WANT OUT,
WHICH IS LIBBY.
WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT
THIS.
YEAH.
THE IS GOING TO BE THE
TOUGHEST PART OF THE GAME.
YEAH, MAN.
THE OTHER SIDE IS SHOOTING
FOR ME, I'M PLAYING MY IDOL.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO PLAY AN IDOL.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR.
THIS RIVALRY WITH CHRIS WILL
COME TO AN END.
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HE JUST
REFUSES TO LET THE GAUNT LET
DOWN.
SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO
TAKE CHRIS OUT, WHICH IS
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN LOOKING TO
DO SINCE DAY ONE.
THERE'S ALL THESE ADVANTAGES
OUT THERE.
GHOST ISLAND OFFERS A LOT OF NOT
JUST ADVANTAGES BUT PROBABLY
IDOLS.
SO HOW MANY IDOLS ARE WE GOING
TO HAVE IN PLAY?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I DON'T THINK CHRIS HAS
ANYTHING.
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY RELICS
ARE SITTING OUT HERE, BUT I HAVE
MY LEGACY ADVANTAGE IN MY
POCKET.
I CAN PLAY IT AT EITHER 13 OR
SIX.
THERE'S 13 OF US IN THIS GAME
RIGHT NOW.
FEAR KEEPS YOU SHARP, SO STAY
FEARFUL AT ALL TIMES.
WHETHER IT'S CHRIS OR ME THAT
GOES HOME TONIGHT, THIS IS GOING
TO BE MY MOMENT TO PUT ALL MY
CHIPS IN AND SAY, I'M TAKING
THIS GUY DOWN.
I'M REAL SKETCHY RIGHT NOW IF
EVERYONE IS ON BOARD, AND MAYBE
IF I AM UNCERTAIN I SHOULD USE
THE IDOL, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
MY GAME COULD LAST A LOT LONG
FERRES I CAN GET THROUGH THIS
ONE TRIBAL AND USE IT AT THE
NEXT ONE.
TONIGHT IT IS A WAR, AND IT'S
TIME TO TAKE DOM OUT.
THERE'S BLOOD IN THE WATER.
LET'S GO FOR THE KILL.
Jeff: CHRIS, GRAB THE ONE
UNIT WILL TORCH, DIP IT IN AND
GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SO CHRISIOUS FIRST TIME COMING
TO TRIBAL.
IS THIS WHEN THE GAME FULLY
KICKS IN NOW FOR YOU?
ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.
BEING HERE AT TRIBAL MAKES ME
FEEL MORE ALIVE THAN EVER.
I KNOW AT SOME POINT IT CAN
REPRESENT YOUR DEATH, BUT TO
EXPERIENCE THIS IS DEFINITELY
TAKING THE GAME TO ANOTHER
LEVEL.
Jeff: DONATHAN, WHAT HAVE
YOU FELT DIFFERENTLY THESE LAST
FEW DAYS NOW THAT YOU HAVE 13
PEOPLE TOGETHER.
YEAH, THERE'S PEOPLE I
HAVEN'T MET BEFORE THAT I GOT
THE MEET AND CONNECT, WITH AND
THERE'S OLD RELATIONSHIPS AND
THERE'S THE SWAP, AND THERE ARE
SO MANY DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS
GOING ON.
IT'S MIND BOGGLING.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT THIS GAME CAN
BE THIS COMPLICATED AND STILL
OFTEN COME DOWN TO A GUT.
IN YOUR NORMAL LIFE, HOW MUCH DO
YOU RELY ON YOUR GUT?
IT'S TOTALLY GUT, YOU KNOW?
YOU GET THAT GUT FEELING WHEN
YOU WALK ON A FISHING BOAT AND
SAY, THAT GUY MIGHT BE A DOUCHE
OR THAT GUY COULD BE COOL WITH
ME.
IT COULD BE THE COMPLETE
OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE TABLE
AND HAVE A BEER WITH THEM.
Jeff: DOMENICK, THAT'S KEY.
THIS IS TYPICALLY A GAME WHERE
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
ADEPENDENT AND REASSESS AND SAY,
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO THAT
PERSON AGAIN.
THAT FITS IN BEAUTIFULLY,
JEFFREY WORK THE SITUATION I'VE
BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE PAST
22 DAYS WITH MY GOOD FRIEND
CHRIS.
MAYBE I'LL TELL MY VERSION IF
YOU DON'T MIND.
YOU CAN TELL YOUR VERSION.
DAY ONE I MADE A CRITICAL
ERROR.
I THINK YOU ASKED, WOULD ANYONE
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION.
OF COURSE, I WAS THE ONLY
KNUCKLE HEAD TO RAISE MY HAND.
SO I WAITED A DAY.
I WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN TO HIM,
CHRIS, LISTEN, I MEND NOTHING
WHEN I POINTED TO YOU ON DAY
ONE, AND HIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
WAS, DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL?
I SAID, WHOA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
DO I HAVE AN IDOL?
HE SAID, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
GUNNING FOR ME MAN.
IT FELT LIKE AN INTERROGATION
MORE THAN A CONVERSATION.
SO AFTER THAT FIRST
CONVERSATION, I GO OUT AND FIND
AN IDOL.
QUITE THE COINCIDENCE.
I'M NOT BUYING THAT HE WENT OUT
AND FOUND IT RIGHT AFTER THE
DISCUSSION.
OH, HELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
JEFF, HERE IT IS.
I'M NOT EVEN HIDING IT ANYMORE.
HERE.
HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M JUST GOING TO WEAR IT.
THAT'S THE SHELL.
SO I SHOW IT TO HIM, AND I
STILL CAN'T WIN THIS I GO'S
LOVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
WITH THIS GUY, JEFFREY, BUT THIS
NIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT NIGHT.
.
Jeff: THIS IS A SHOWDOWN.
THIS IS A SHOWDOWN AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERN, SO I WORE MY FINEST
ATTIRE FOR TONIGHT, JEFF.
Jeff: WOW.
Jeff: DOMENICK.
YOU HAD EVERYONE RIVETTED.
NOW THE REBUTTAL.
LOOK, DOM DID SHOW ME THE
IDOL, BUT I I GET BACK FROM
GHOST ISLAND TO FIND OUT THEY
TRIED TO VOTE ANG OUT BECAUSE
THEY BASICALLY WANT TO GET RID
OF MY CLOSEST ALLY, YET
TECHNICALLY WE'RE ALL IN THE
SAME NAVITI.
TIME OUT.
AS SOON AS WE SWAPPED, YOU
JUMPED RIGHT ON TO THE MALOLO
SIDE OF THINGS.
THAT'S NOT US STAYING STRONG.
WE WANTED TO STAY STRONG.
BECAUSE I COULDN'T TRUST HIM.
HOW DO YOU NOT TRUST THIS MAN
IF HE HAS TOLD YOU EVERYTHING?
I GET YOUR FRUSTRATION, BUT
THIS IS MORE BETWEEN DOM AND I
AND MY GUT TELLING ME THAT I
CAN'T TRUST HIM.
Jeff: OKAY.
SO CRAZY THIS IS OPEN
DISCUSSION.
SORRY.
Jeff: NOW THAT WE'RE FINALL
TOGETHER, I'M COOL WITH IT BEING
A SHOWDOWN.
Jeff: DOMENICK, DOES THAT
MEAN ONE OF YOU TWO ARE GOING
HOME TONIGHT?
I KNOW I'M DEFINITELY ON THE
HOT PLATE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
IT STARTED WHEN WE WENT BACK TO
CAMP.
11 OF THEM TOOK OFF AND WENDELL
AND I SAT ALONE.
BRO, IT WAS ME AND COME IN
THE LIVING ROOM CHILLING.
Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE DID EVERYONE GO?
IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYONE GOT
VERY THIRSTY VERY FAST.
11 AS A GROUP LINED UP AND WENT
TO GET SOME WATER.
Jeff: SO ANGELA, IS IT SAFE
TO ASSUME, IF YOU ARE DOMENICK
AND WENDELL, THAT THERE WERE
CONVERSATIONS THAT MIGHT PLAY
OUT TONIGHT THAT YOU WERE NOT
PRIVY TO?
IT'S DEFINITELY SAFE TO.
ASSUME, THAT JEFF.
AND IT'S EASY TO SAY, LET'S GO
WITH THE BIG PLAN, BUT I DON'T
KNOW HOW MANY SMALLER PLANS
THERE ARE, SO IF I SEE PEOPLE
ROLLING AND IT'S THE MAJORITY,
I'M ROLLING WITH THEM.
Jeff: LIBBY, WHO WAS
LEADING THE GROUP?
SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY, I'M
THIRSTY.
YEAH, THAT GUY.
Jeff: SO CHRIS WENT FIRST?
CHRIS, ARE YOU STILL THE LEADER
OF THE PACK?
YOU WERE SELECTED AS LEADER ON
DAY ONE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
EVERYBODY FOLLOWED YOU TODAY?
I DEFINITELY WOULD LOOK AT
MYSELF AS SOMEONE A LOT OF
PEOPLE GET ALONG WITH AND MAYBE
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING
CERTAIN SITUATIONS WITH ME.
Jeff: SO DOMENICK, THIS IS
A FEAR THAT CHRIS AND A WHOLE
GROUP ARE DOING SOMETHING YOU'RE
NOT PART OF.
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S GREAT THAT I'M WEARING THIS
THING, BUT MY BUDDY RIGHT HERE
IS NOT.
THEY MIGHT WANT TO GET CRAFTY
AND I MAY HAVE TO MAKE A
DECISION ON WHAT I WANT TO DO TO
PROTECT MY FRIEND OR PROTECT
MYSELF, SO YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD
AS MINE AT THIS POINT, BUT I AM
GENUINELY SCARED TONIGHT.
Jeff: LIBBY, WHAT IS THIS
REVELATION OF DOM AND CHRIS SAY
ABOUT THE STAKES OF THIS GAME?
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, IT'S 13
OF US.
YOU'RE FORMING BONDS.
YOU'RE PROVING ALLIANCES.
WE ALL HEARD CHRIS.
WE HEARD DOM OUT.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU CAN FULLY
TRUST, WHO YOU CAN'T ANYMORE.
IT'S CRAZY.
THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH.
Jeff: KELLYN, YOU'RE THE
ONLY PERSON THAT RIGHT NOW IS
ABSOLUTELY SAFE.
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
JEFF, EVERYONE KNOWS IN
"SURVIVOR" THE FIRST MERGE VOTE
IS CRAZY.
THIS THERE COULD BE IDOLS.
THERE COULD BE ADVANTAGES.
AND JUST WITH TRIBAL BEING LIKE
SO OPEN, I'M SO GLAD THAT IT
WON'T BE MY NAME THAT'S COMING
OUT OF THAT JAR TONIGHT.
Jeff: CHRIS, AT THIS POINT
WHEN WE'RE GETTING READY TO
VOTE, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS TALK
OF AN 11, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO TRY TO MAKE
SURE IT'S NOT YOU TONIGHT?
I HAVE TRIED TO DEVELOP THE
MOST TRUST AMONGST PEOPLE THAT
I.
CAN DO M AND I'S FRUSTRATIONS
ARE OUR FRUSTRATIONS.
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK
THERE ARE TRUE RELATIONSHIP, KEY
ALLIANCE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY
TRUSTING YOUR GUT INSTINCT.
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TRUST MY
GUT INSTINCT.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S FIND OUT HOW IT'S GOING TO
SHAKE OUT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CHRIS, YOU'RE UP.
GO GET 'EM, BUDDY.
THANK YOU, BUD.
DOM, WENDELL, NOTHING AGAINST
YOU GUY,.
LOVE YOU.
Jeff: CHRIS NOBLE, IT'S
BEEN A PLEASURE SERVING YOU
COFFEE FOR 22 DAYS.
SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE,
BROTHER.
WE WON A LOT TOGETHER.
RESPECT FOR THAT.
BUT SOCIALLY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
I HOPE YOU STOP SAYING "I" SO
MUCH.
I HOPE YOU START LISTENING TO
PEOPLE.
OH, YEAH, AND FINALLY, SOMEBODY
HAD TO SAY IT, I'LL SAY IT, STOP
RAPPING.
YOU'RE TRASH.
AT RAPPING.
YOU'RE GARBAGE AT RAPPING.
YOU CAN'T RAP.
YOU HAVE NO BARS.
PUT THE MIC DOWN, BRO.
PUT THE PEN DOWN, BRO.
USE AN ERASER.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
JEFF, JEFF, JEFF, I GOT A BETTER
IDEA.
SO THIS IS THE SIERRA DAWN
THOMAS LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
THIS WAS ACTUALLY WON BY JACOB
ON DAY ONE.
HE WILLED IT TO MORGAN, AND SHE
WILLED IT TO ME.
THIS ALLOWS ME THE PLAY IMMUNITY
AT 13 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME OR
SIX.
I'M PLAYING IT TONIGHT FOR
MYSELF AT 13.
Jeff: THANK YOU.
YOU GOT IT.
Jeff: THIS IS THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DOM WILL NOT
COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE CHRIS.
CHRIS.
TWO VOTES CHRIS.
LIBBY.

THAT'S TWO VOTES LIBBY.
TWO VOTES CHRIS.

THAT'S THREE VOTES CHRIS, TWO
VOTES LIBBY.

FOUR VOTES CHRIS.

THAT'S FIVE VOTES CHRIS.

THAT'S SIX VOTES CHRIS, TWO

EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, CHRIS.
THAT'S SEVEN, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
GOOD LUCK, BROTHER.
IT'S ALL GOOD, DUDE.
GREAT JOB.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
OHER TORCH.
Jeff: CHRIS, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, IF TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS AN
INDICATOR OF HOW THE BACK HALF
OF THIS GAME IS GOING TO GO,
EVERYBODY BETTER COME TO PLAY
EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY SINGLE
DAY.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

THE ISLAND.

SIDE.

NIGHTMARES ABOUT THIS LITTLE
HAUNTED THING FOR A WHILE.
