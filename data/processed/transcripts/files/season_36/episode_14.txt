        WHAT'S GOING ON, "SURVIVOR"?
I'M WENDELL HOLLAND.
I'M 28.
I'M FROM PHILADELPHIA, P.A.
YOU HAVE TO PICK ME TO BE ON THE
NEXT SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."
Jeff: WELL, WE DIDN'T PUT
HIM ON BACK IN 2012, BUT HE KEPT
APPLYING, AND CLEARLY IT PAID
OFF.
I GOT TO CHECK IN ON SAMANTHA.
SAMANTHA, HOLD IT UP.
HOW DID YOU DO?
WENDELL.








WE'RE 2-2.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE HOW THE JURY VOTED.
ROLL THAT FOR US, JOE.
HERE'S EVERYBODY THAT VOTED FOR
DOM.
YOU GOT CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE,
JENNA, AND MICHAEL.
AND THEN THE OTHER FIVE VOTES
WERE FOR WENDELL, CHELSEA,
KELLYN, ANGELA, SEBASTIAN, AND
DONATHAN.
AND IT CAME DOWN TO LAUREL.
SO WENDELL, WHEN THAT MOMENT
HAPPENED, EVERYBODY ON THE JURY
SHOCKED, WE'RE ALL SHOCKED, I'M
A LITTLE SHOCKED WE HAVE A TIE
VOTE.
WHEN LAUREL STARTS MAKING HER
WALK, TRUE CONFESSION, HOW
CONFIDENT WERE YOU THAT THAT
RELATIONSHIP YOU BUILT WITH HER








WOULD PAY OFF?
I WAS VERY CONFIDENT, BUT I
KNEW THAT DOM HAD A TREMENDOUS
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER ALSO.
BUT IT DID FEEL GOOD KNOWING
THAT LAUREL WAS THE ONE CASTING
THAT TIE-BREAKING VOTE.
Jeff: LAUREL, WHAT WAS IT?
THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ON EITHER
SIDE.
"SURVIVOR" IS SO COMPLICATED.
THERE ARE RELATIONSHIPS.
THERE'S GAME PLAY.
WHAT WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR?
IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE
DECISION.
THESE GUYS ARE BOTH DESERVING OF
BEING THE WINNER.
THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO HARD.
THEY PLAYED A SIMILAR STRATEGIC
GAME.
THEY MADE THE SAME MOVE IN A
SIMILAR WAY.
FOR ME IT CAME DOWN TO WENDELL'S
SOCIAL GAME AND OUR PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP.
Jeff: AND DOMENICK, YOU
SAID IT.
IF I DO THIS WRONG, THAT URN
WILL REMAIN CURSED AND I'LL
SECOND GUESS IT.
ARE YOU SECOND-GUESSING THAT
FIRE, OR DO YOU JUST LIVE WITH
IT?
DOES THE GAMBLER IN YOU SAY,
HEY, THAT'S THE MOVE I MADE?
I KNEW THREE SECONDS AFTER
YOU SAID IT WAS A TIE IT WAS A
WRAP FOR MY.
EVERY NIGHT I SAID, WHY DIDN'T I
TAKE HIM HEAD TO HEAD IN FIRE.
I WAS CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITY TO
DO IT.
BUT THAT'S WHERE I FELL SHORT.
AND I THINK I PLAYED WITH FEAR
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME.
AND I NEVER GOT TOO CONFIDENT.
AND THAT'S WHERE I PLAYED WELL,
BUT I THINK MY INABILITY TO
REALIZE THAT I WAS BEING A
LITTLE TOO OVERCONFIDENT AT THE
END AND NOT PUT MYSELF OUT THERE
WITH HIM IS WHERE I DROPPED THE
BALL.
Jeff: WELL, ONE THING THAT
CAME FROM THIS IS ONE OF THE
GREATEST FRIENDSHIPS I'VE EVER
SEEN ON THE SHOW.
THROW THAT UP.
THERE IS AN IMAGE THAT SPEAKS TO
THE LOVE AFFAIR.
LOOK AT THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
IN FACT, DOM, JUST BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO HOME EMPTY
HANDED, A LITTLE SOMETHING YOU
CAN PUT OVER YOUR BED.
A LITTLE CONSOLATION PRIZE.
MICHAEL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE HAD SOMEBODY, REALLY
ANYBODY, BUT ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY
YOUR AGE THAT HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
ATTRACTED TO THE ENERGY AND YOUR
MATURITY.
YOU'RE 18.
WHERE DOES THAT MATURITY COME
FROM?
I ALWAYS KIND OF RAN WITH THE
OLDER CROWD IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND
I EVEN GRADUATED EARLY.
SO I PROVED OUT TO L.A. ON MY
18th BIRTHDAY, I PACKED MY
CAR AND DROVE CROSS COUNTRY.
Jeff: IS THAT MOM AND DAD?
IT'S ALL MY FAMILY.
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
THEY RAISED ME RIGHT.
ALL THE CREDIT TO THEM.
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
Jeff: THERE THEY ARE.
I HAD A LOT OF KIDS COME UP TO
ME AND SAY, I'M ALMOST MICHAEL'S
AGE.
GET OUT HERE.
COME PLAY.
Jeff: EXACTLY, YES.
COME OUT HERE, YOUNGSTERS.
WE WANT YOU.
AND CHRIS, YOU AND DOM WHO HAD
ONE OF THE BIGGEST RIVALRIES
EVER, BUT I HEARD YOU BURIED THE
HATCHET AND DID AN M.SYSTEM WALK
TOGETHER.
WE DID DO AN M.S. WALK.
I GOT TO SAY, DOM AND I'S
RIVALRY WAS REAL, BUT WE HAD A
SECOND PEACE TREATY.
HE TOOK ME IN LIKE FAMILY.
WE WENT OUT TO THE M.S. WALK FOR
THE NATIONAL M.S. SOCIETY.
MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED AT 27.
I'M ON "SURVIVOR" AT 27.
I LOVE MY MOM TO DEATH, AND I
ALMOST LOST HER.
TO BE OUT HERE AND SPREAD THE
AWARENESS...
Jeff: YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
VERY INSPIRATIONAL.
WELL, WE COULDN'T DO THIS SEASON
WITHOUT GUYS LIKE JAMES AND
ERIC.
JAMES IS STILL HUGE, AND ERIC
HAS HIS LONG HAIR AGAIN.
I OWE THEM BOTH AN APOLOGY.
THAT'S NEXT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Jeff: "SURVIVOR" REUNION
WILL CONTINUE ONLY ON CBS.
Jeff: WELCOME BACK,
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND" REUNION
SHOW.
SO TO DO AN IDEA LIKE GHOST
ISLAND, YOU FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A
HISTORY, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF
GUYS LIKE ERIC AND JAMES THAT WE
HAVE THESE EARLY DUMB MOVES THAT
WE CAN DO THIS.
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT SPORTS.
SO JAMES, YOU WERE FIRSTING YOU
HAD TWO IDOLS IN YOUR POCKET.
YOU GOT VOTED OUT.
OVER THE YEARS, WAS THAT HARD
WHEN EVERY TIME WE THIS A
DUMBEST MOVE LIST, YOU'RE ONE OR
TWO ON THE LIST.
YEAH, IT REALLY WAS KIND OF
HARD.
IT KIND OF MADE ME NOT WATCH THE
SHOW ANYMORE.
IT KIND OF TRAUMATIZED ME.
Jeff: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jeff: HERE'S THE THING.
I REALIZED DURING THE SEASON,
YOU FOUND TWO IDOLS.
I COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED THAT THE
ENTIRE TIME, BECAUSE REALLY MUCH
LIKE ERIC, WHO WE'LL GET TO IN A
SECOND, YOU WERE JUST AN EARLY
ADOPTER OF A RISKY MOVE.
YOU ROLLED THE DICE AND GOT
CAUGHT.
SO HAS SENSE OF HUMOR KICKED?
ARE YOU OKAY NOW?
IT WAS FUN WHEN IT WAS GOING
ON.
I DIDN'T TAKE IT THAT
PERSONALLY.
Jeff: YOU HAVE GUYS LIKE
MICHAEL WHO IDOLIZED YOU WHEN HE
FOUND YOUR IDOL.
100%.
I STARTED WATCHING THE SHOW WHEN
I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD, SO FOR ME
TO COME OUT AND PLAY THE GAME
THAT I KNOW AND LOVE AND FIND
YOUR IDOL AND FEEL LIKE I COULD
RIGHT THOSE WRONGS AND MAKE
EVERYTHING COME FULL CIRCLE, I
WAS LIKE, THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS AMAZING.
IT WAS AWESOME.
IT WAS AN HONOR.
Jeff: NOBODY WAS HAPPIER
THAN JAMES WHEN THIS HAPPENED IN
SEASON 16 TEN YEARS AGO.
TAKE A LOOK.
I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.
Jeff: 13th PERSON VOTED
OUT AND SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY, ERIC, BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
YOU CAN SEE JAMES, THE BURDEN
LIFT LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL, LIFT
RIGHT OFF HIS SHOULDERS AND OVER
TO ERIC.
ERIC, PAVE RTY HAD A LINE, YOU
WILL GO DOWN AS THE DUMBEST
"SURVIVOR" EVER.
JUST TO BE THERE WAS AMAZING
AS MAN OF THE SHOW.
JEFF PROBST IS STANDING RIGHT
THERE.
EVERY DAY WAS A GIFT MY FIRST
SEASON, SO, I MEAN, THERE'S SO
MUCH TO THIS.
LIKE WITH THESE MISTAKES, THEY
SHOW YOU WHO YOU ARE AS A HUMAN,
THESE HUMAN MOMENTS SHOW UP,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY MAKES
MISTAKES.
OVER TIME I'VE HAD TO WORK
THROUGH ALL OF THAT.
IF YOU DON'T LAUGH, YOU'RE GOING
TO CRY.
THAT'S PART OF IT.
TOO.
Jeff: SO YOU'RE LAUGHING
NOW.
BECAUSE JUST LIKE JAMES, I
FORGET THAT ERIC MADE IT TO
FINAL FIVE, LASTED 36 DAYS BOTH
TIMES HE PLAYED.
WON CHALLENGES.
YOU'RE AN ALL-STAR PLAYER.
SO WE'RE REFRAMING HISTORY RIGHT
NOW.
KELLYN, JUST QUICKLY BEFORE WE
GO TO THE BREAK, 7 OF THE 11
ADVANTAGES THAT WERE HAUNTED
HAUNTED AGAIN.
YOU WENT TO GHOST ISLAND TWICE.
IS IT ALL JUST COINCIDENCE, OR
DOES IT GET IN YOUR HEAD?
OF COURSE AT FIRST GLANCE YOU
THINK IT MAY BE COINCIDENCE, BUT
WHEN I AM SCARED OF GHOST
ISLAND, I DRAW THAT ROCK THAT
FIRST DAY.
YOU ALL SAW WENDELL, I'M NOT
SITTING IN THAT ORANGE SEAT.
IT REALLY, WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE
IN IT, YOU CAN FEEL THE
"SURVIVOR" LURE.
IT WAS A PHENOMENAL EXPERIENCE,
FOR FANS OF THE SHOW.
Jeff: IT'S ONE OF THE
REASONS THIS GAME CONTINUES TO
EXCITE ME.
YOU EMBRACE IT.
THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY, THEY
EMBRACE THE SHOW.
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN WE COME BACK, I HATE THAT
THIS SEASON IS ENDING, BUT A NEW
ONE BEGINS AND IT'S REALLY FUN.
PLUS THE INCREDIBLE KEVIN HART.
WHY IS HE GOING TO BE HERE?
THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL COMEDY
SUPERSTAR.
HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE NEWEST
MEMBER OF THE CBS FAMILY WITH AN
EXCLUSIVE PREVIEW ABOUT HIS NEW
SHOW "T.K.O.," TOTAL KNOCK-OUT.
I SAW HIM SHOOTING YESTERDAY.
IT WAS VERY FUNNY.
HE WILL BE HERE NEXT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Jeff: WELL, IT'S ALWAYS
HARD TO END ONE SEASON.
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A NEW SEASON
OF "SURVIVOR" COMING THIS FALL.
TAKE A LOOK.
"SURVIVOR," A GAME OF SOCIAL
POLITICS THAT OFTEN CENTERS
AROUND THE STORY OF THE UNDERDOG
VERSUS THE FAVORITE.
AND THIS TIME WE'RE HITTING IT
HEAD-ON.
IT'S "SURVIVOR: DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH."
THE DAVIDS, TEN STRANGERS WHO
SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON,
OVERCOMING ADVERSITY.
IT'S THE ONLY THING THEY'VE
KNOWN.
I GREW UP IN A TRAILER.
WE HAD FOOD STAMPS.
WHEN YOU GROW UP LIKE ME, YOU
NEVER FORGET WHERE YOU CAME
FROM.
YOU GOT TO BUST YOUR BUTT.
NOTHING IN THIS LIFE IS FREE.
IT DON'T COME EASY.
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A VERY
NEUROTIC PERSON, BUT I'M LUCK I
CAN ENOUGH TO NEVER HAVE HAD A
FULL-ON PANIC ATTACK.
SO LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
OUT HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Jeff: THEY'LL TAKE ON THE
GOLIATHS, TEN STRANGERS WHO ALSO
SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON,
CAPITALIZING ON THEIR ADVANTAGE
AND USING IT TO SQUASH THEIR
OPPONENTS.
I HAVE HAD A FAIRY TALE LIFE.
I STUDIED AT STANFORD
UNIVERSITY.
I GOT MY MBA FROM YALE.
AND I'M JUST LIKE UNSTOPPABLE.
I'M FAST AS A CORVETTE, AS
BIG AS A HUMMER.
MILLIONS OF WRESTLING FANS KNOW
ME AS THE MAYOR OF SLAMTOWN.
I'VE BEEN CHAMPION OF EVERY
ORGANIZATION I WORK FOR.
Jeff: BUT WHEN YOU'RE
ABANDONED ON A DESERTED ISLAND
WITH NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT, IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU WERE
BORN WITH IT OR HAD THE FIGHT
FOR IT, BECAUSE EVERY GOLIATH
HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL.
I'M STUBBORN AS HELL.
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME, BUT IF
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD.
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME SPEAKS
POWER.
Jeff: AND EVERY DAVID A
SEEK AT WEAPON.
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK I'M
WEAKER THAN I AM.
THEY WILL JUST ASSUME I'M A
HUGE NERD, WHICH IS NOT ENTIRELY
INCORRECT.
BUT REALLY I HAVE STUDIED THIS
GAME.
I'M GOING TO SHOW I'M GOOD AT
IT.
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED ABOUT
WHAT I CAN PULL OUT.
Jeff: IT'S "SURVIVOR: DAVID
VERSUS GOLIATH" COMING THIS
FALL.
IT'S ANOTHER GOOD ONE, BUT
BEFORE WE'RE BACK ON THE AIR,
THERE IS A NEW SHOW PREMIERING
ON CBS HOSTED BY KEVIN HART.
KEVIN, COME OUT HERE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 OH, OH, OH.
OH, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HELLO, MAN.
WOW.
Jeff: IT'S NOT OFTEN --
WHAT?
WHAT'S UP?
WELL, I'M A LITTLE BLOWN
AWAY, MAN.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR
QUITE SOME TIME.
I THOUGHT YOU ALL WERE OUTSIDE
AND YOU'RE NOT.
Jeff: VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW
IT IS THE TRUMAN SHOW.
I'M REALLY HURT.
I REALLY THOUGHT ALL THIS TIME
ALL YOU GUYS WERE ON THE ISLAND,
AND YOU'RE NOT.
THIS IS... I'M HURT.
I'M REALLY HURT AND I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU AFTER.
THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.
Jeff: WELL, I WENT OVER
YESTERDAY, I CAME OVER WITH A
COUPLE LITTLE KIDS TO SEE YOUR
NEW SHOW, "TKO:TOTAL KNOCKOUT."
IT IS VERY FUNNY.
WALK US THROUGH WHAT IT IS.
EXPLAIN THE SHOW, BECAUSE IT'S
MADE FOR "SURVIVOR" FANS.
I WAS GOING TO SAY, YOU
SHOULD RELATE TO IT BECAUSE IT'S
IN THIS WHEEL HOUSE.
WE BASICALLY COMBINE DODGEBALL
AND OBSTACLE COURSES.
IT'S A SHOW FOR EVERYBODY,
MOTHERS, FATHERS, BROTHERS,
SISTERS, AUNTS, UNCLES.
WHOEVER.
YOU CAN COME ON THIS SHOW AND
COMPETE.
YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THE BEAUTY OF IT, IT'S HOSTED BY
ONE OF THE TALLEST, MOST
ATTRACTIVE MEN IN SHOW BUSINESS,
MYSELF.
Jeff: WELL, IT'S
INTERESTING BECAUSE SO MANY OF
THESE OBSTACLE COURSE SHOWS, YOU
HAVE TO BE AN ELITE ATHLETE.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS.
NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR SHOW.
WE WANTED TO GO THE OPPOSITE.
WE WANT TO MAKE ROOM FOR THAT
INDIVIDUAL THAT DOESN'T CONSIDER
THEMSELVES TO BE AN AMAZING
ULTIMATE ATHLETE.
THIS IS A SPACE FOR YOU.
THIS IS YOUR WHEEL HOUSE.
Jeff: TAKE A LOOK.
HERE IT IS.
A LITTLE BIT OF "TKO".
T, K, GO!
OH, MY GOSH.
BOOM.
I THOUGHT HE HIT ME.
NO, YOU HIT YOURSELF.
OH, OH.
LIKE, THAT JUST ONE FOOT.
Jeff: YEAH.
IT LOOKS GOOD.
IT LOOKS GREAT.
AND LISTEN, EVERYBODY, IT DEBUTS
WEDNESDAY JULY 11th AT 8:00
P.M.
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK IT OUT.
THE SHOW IS GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
Jeff: KEVIN HART, THANK
YOU.
GET OUT HERE.
GET BACK TO WORK.
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.
GOOD-BYE.
GUYS, I LOVE IT.
Jeff: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Jeff: ONE MORE TIME THE
AMAZING GROUP OF PLAYERS FROM
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."
THE GOAL IS THIS: SOMEBODY WHO
IS INSPIRED TO APPLY TONIGHT
WILL GET ON.
IF YOU WANT THE BID ON PROMISE
FROM THIS SEASON,
PROCEEDS GO TO STAND UP TO
CANCER.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO BE
SO LOYAL.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN FALL FOR
"SURVIVOR: DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH."
GOOD NIGHT.
