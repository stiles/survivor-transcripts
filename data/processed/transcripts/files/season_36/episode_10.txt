        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL, DESIREE WAS WILLING TO
JUMP SHIP ON HER ALLIANCE.
I'M READY TO TAKE OUT KELLYN,
WENDELL, AND DOM.
Jeff: BUT LAUREN WARNED
DOM.
OH, MY GOD.
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GO BUST OUT
HERE.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DOMENICK, WENDELL, AND KELLYN
STRUCK FIRST.
DESIREE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?








Captioning funded by CBS
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS QUITE THE
DRAMATIC SCENE.
IT WAS A HUGE CHALLENGE TO
FIGURE OUT WHO IS TELLING THE
TRUTH AND WHO IS LYING.
LAUREL HAD TOLD ME THAT THE
NAVITI GIRLS WERE LOOKING THE
TAKE MYSELF, KELLYN, AND WENDELL
OUT OF THIS GAME, SO THANK GOD
FOR LAUREL.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR SAVING MY ASS.
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.
LISTEN, IF YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT
YOU DID, ONE OF US WOULD BE
GONE.
I APPRECIATE IT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME I FEEL
REALLY GREAT ABOUT MY SPOT IN
THE GAME.








I FEEL LIKE I HAVE JUST LOCKED
IN PROTECTION FROM KELLYN,
DOMENICK, AND WENDELL, BECAUSE I
SAVED THEM TONIGHT.
I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING
DOUBTED YOU.
YOU GUYS HAD YOUR REASONS.
YEAH.
ONGOING.
EVEN BEFORE THIS VOTE, IT...
I THINK THAT SOLIDIFIED YOU IN
THE WAY THAT ALL WENT DOWN.
IT'S A GOOD GROUP OF PEOPLE.
EVEN THOUGH LAUREL SAVED MY LIFE
IN THIS GAME, I'M STILL NOT 100%
SURE I WANT TO WORK WITH HER
MOVING FORWARD.
THE GOOD NEWS IS NAVITI IS STILL
AHEAD IN THE NUMBERS, AND THAT'S
HOW I'LL GET TO THE END OF THE
GAME, BY STAYING NAVITI STRONG.
IF WE DO GET ANOTHER RIPE
PAPAYA, I THINK WE SHOULD DO A
FREE RICE BATCH.
11 DAYS.
THE FINISH LINE IS IN SIGHT.
IT'S CRAZY.
I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE YOU.
BRO, BRO, BRO.
WE'LL PUT OUR BRAINS
TOGETHER.
WE CAN.
WE CAN.
IT'S OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THAT
DOMENICK AND I ARE ALLIES.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
EVERYONE KNOWS IT.
PEOPLE HAVE TARGETED US BEFORE.
IT'S NOTHING NEW.
BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE
THAT LAUREL AND DONATHAN ARE
ALSO WITH US.
WE'RE ALL KEEPING IT ON THE LOW.
I THINK THAT'S OUR BEST STRATEGY
TO GET TO THE END.
DOM, IF WE GO AT EACH OTHER,
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO DIE OUT
HERE.
YES.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN.
I COMPLETELY 1,000% AGREE.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
WENDELL AND I'S RELATIONSHIP
IS CRAZY.
WE'RE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.
BUT I CAME HERE TO WIN THIS
MONEY FOR MY FAMILY, SO IF IT
MEANS I HAVE TO CUT THIS BOND
THAT I HAVE WITH WENDELL, THAT'S
A RISK I'M WILLING TO TAKE WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT.
I ALREADY HAVE AN IDOL IN MY
POSSESSION, BUT MICHAEL PLAYED
AN IDOL A COUPLE DAYS AGO, SO IF
THERE IS A NEW ONE PLANTED ON
THIS ISLAND, I INTEND TO GET MY
HANDS ON IT.
I CAN'T GIVE UP AT THIS POINT.
I NEED TO DO THIS FOR MY WIFE
AND MY KIDS.
I HAVE BEEN LIVING AT THIS
CAMP SINCE DAY ONE, SO I KIND OF
KNOW THE LANDMARKS ACROSS THE
BEACH WHERE I CAN LOOK FOR TREES
THAT LOOK SUSPICIOUS IN SOME WAY
OR ANOTHER.
OR ROCKS THAT NEED TO BE PLACED
SOMEWHERE THAT JUST DOESN'T LOOK
NORMAL.
I THINK THAT'S MY ONE LEG UP ON
SOME OF THE OTHER PLAYERS OUT
HERE RIGHT NOW, AND I'M PASSING
THIS GROVE AGAIN, AND I LOOK
DOWN AND I SEE THIS COCONUT WITH
AN EMBLEM ON IT.
AND I KNEW I STRUCK GOLD.
FEELING THE WEIGHT OF IT, IT
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING SOLID IS IN
HERE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE A MOMENT TO
OPEN IT UP.
I GOT TO LOSE THIS THING IN A
SECOND.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT
MAY OFFER YOU POWER, ALTHOUGH IT
MAY NOT BE THE POWER YOU EXPECT.
THIS IS DAVID'S AUTHENTIC FAKE
IDOL THAT HE USED TO FOOL JAY IN
SURVIVOR'S 33rd SEASON.
WOW.
THIS GROVE ACTUALLY REMINDED ME
OF THE MILLENNIALS GENERAL X
SEASON.
HAVING MADE IT TO THE FINAL SIX,
JAY DID THE SAME THING YOU JUST
DID.
HOW STUPID.
HE PICK UP A COCONUT AND
FOUND DAVID'S FAKE IDOL.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
BELIEVING IT TO BE REAL.
YOU GOT TO BE QUICKER THAN
THAT.
JAY LET HIS GUARD DOWN.
IT WAS A COSTLY MISTAKE.
Jeff: THIS IS A WORK OF ART
BUT NOT A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
JAY WAS VOTED OUT THAT NIGHT.
OH, MY GOD.
THIS TAINTED IDOL HAS NOT
MATURED INTO A REAL IDOL, SO
BECAUSE IT HAS NO POWER, THERE
IS NO WAY TO REVERSE THE CURSE.
INSTEAD, YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO
GAIN POWER LIES IN YOUR ABILITY
TO FOOL ANOTHER PLAYER.
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU CLEVER
ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF.
I'M GOING TO STASH THIS.
DAVID FOOLED JAY WITH THIS, AND
JAY ENDED UP GOING HOME THAT
NIGHT.
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLAY, AND
IT'S SOMETHING I HOPE I CAN
REPLICATE OUT HERE.
THE QUESTION IS DO I WANT TO
JUST PLANT THIS IDOL SOMEWHERE
OR DO I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET SOMEONE?
THERE'S NO ONE THAT'S GOING TO
PULL THIS OFF BETTER THAN I AM.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
YES, SIR.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CHELSEA.
I HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE
NECKLACE.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO PULL UP ON A BAR,
CLAMPING A BALL BETWEEN TWO SETS
OF JAWS.
IF AT ANY POINT YOU RELEASE THE
PRESSURE, THAT BALL WILL DROP,
AND YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
TODAY THERE'S A TWIST.
BECAUSE NOT ONE, BUT TWO PEOPLE
WILL WIN IMMUNITY.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: AND TWO PEOPLE WILL
BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING TWO
SEPARATE TRIBAL COUNCILS.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
WOW.
WHOA.
Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING
TO WORK: WE'RE GOING TO DRAW FOR
TWO TEMPORARY NEW TRIBES, FIVE
ORANGE, FIVE PURPLE.
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING
FOR ORANGE WINS IMMUNITY AND IS
SAFE AT THEIR TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WHOA.
Jeff: THE LAST PERSON LEFT
STANDING FOR PURPLE WINS
IMMUNITY, IS SAFE AT THEIR
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO TWO PEOPLE ARE GOING HOME,
AND FOR A LITTLE ADDED INCENTIVE
TO HANG IN THERE, THE LAST
PERSON LEFT STANDING FOR ALL TEN
OF YOU EARNS THE RIGHT FOR THEIR
TRIBE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
LAST, SO THEY WILL KNOW WHO WAS
VOTED OUT FIRST.
OH, MY GOD.
WHOA.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
DO-OR-DIE TIME.
NO GHOST ISLAND TODAY.
ENOUGH STAKES.
WE'RE GOING TO DRAW FOR OUR TWO
TRIBES.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TRIBES.
ON ONE TRIBE, WEARING ORANGE,
MICHAEL, LAUREL, DOMENICK,
WENDELL, AND KELLYN ALL
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER.
ONE OF THE FIVE GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
ON THE OTHER FIVE, CHELSEA,
SEBASTIAN, ANGELA, JENNA, AND
DONATHAN.
YOU ARE ONLY COMPETING AGAINST
EACH OTHER, AS WELL.
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN IMMUNITY.
ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME.
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR HANDLES.
LIFT UP.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS GOOD AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.
A NEW CHALLENGE AND ANOTHER NEW
TWIST FOR SURVIVOR IN ITS
36th SEASON.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOUR ARMS.
IF YOU RELEASE THE PRESSURE,
THAT TOO WILL PULL THAT HANDLE
DOWN.
YOUR BALL WILL DROP, AN YOU'LL
BE ON THE SITOUT BENCH.
ONLY FIVE PEOPLE ON EACH TRIBE,
IMMUNITY IS SO IMPORTANT
TONIGHT.
KELLYN NOW WITH HER FIRST SLIP.
THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF RELEASE ON
THAT PRESSURE, THAT'S ALL IT
TAKES.
AND KELLYN WITH A SECOND DROP.
KELLYN IS THE FIRST OUT.
KELLYN, NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY
TONIGHT.
A DECEIVING CHALLENGE.
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP PULLING UP
YOU WILL KEEP THOSE JAWS
CLAMPED.
MICHAEL DROPS, STEPS OFF,
MICHAEL IS OUT.
MICHAEL, NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
MICHAEL TAKES A SPOT ON THE
BENCH.
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IT CAN
HAPPEN.
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE FOR ORANGE,
ALL FIVE OF THE PURPLE STILL IN
IT AND LOOKING STRONG.
THE PRESSURE WILL ONLY GET WORSE
FROM HERE.
BECAUSE IF YOU DO RELEASE A
LITTLE AND THAT BALL STARTS TO
DROP, IT BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT TO HOLD IT UP.
AND JUST LIKE THAT DONATHAN, ONE
LITTLE MOVE AND HE'S OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR ON PURPLE,
THREE ON ORANGE.
LAUREL LOSING A LITTLE PRESSURE.
THAT BALL INCHING CLOSER AND
CLOSER TO THE END.
LAUREL DROPS.
LAUREL IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO LEFT ON
ORANGE.
DOMENICK AND WENDELL SIDE BY
SIDE BATTLING FOR THAT IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
HE WILL NOT BEAT ME.
JEFF, I'M WINNING.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BEAT ME,
JEFF.
Jeff: A LOT OF TALKING.
FURTHER DOWN WEARING PURPLE,
CHELSEA, SEBASTIAN, ANGELA, AND
JENNA BATTLING FOR IMMUNITY.
IT HURTS.
HOLD STRONG.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN WITH HIS
FIRST SLIP.
JEAB NOW WITH HER FIRST SLIP.
JENNA WITH ANOTHER SLIP.
SEBASTIAN AND JENNA BOTH IN
TROUBLE.
SEBASTIAN DROPS.
HE'S OUT.
JENNA TRYING TO READJUST.
NO.
JENNA DROPS.
SHE'S OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO ON EACH
TRIBE.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNEITY FOR EITHER
DOMENICK AND WENDELL OR EITHER
CHELSEA OR ANGELA COULD BE WORTH
$1 MILLION.
HELL, YEAH.
Jeff: YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE
15 MINUTES.
WENDELL'S ARMS NOW SHAKING.
DOMENICK'S FOREARMS MOVING.
ANGELA HAS NOT MOVED AT ALL.
CHELSEA, OUT OF NOWHERE, HER
BALL STARTS TO MOVE.
CHELSEA STRUGGLING TO STAY IN
THIS.
SHE'S BEEN STRONG FOR A LONG
TIME.
CHELSEA'S WHOLE BODY NOW MOVING.
SHE'S STILL IN IT, THOUGH.
ANGELA OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS.
CHELSEA WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
AND THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.
CHELSEA'S OUT, AND THAT MEANS
PURPLE WILL BE GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL FIRST.
SHE'S SAFE EITHER WAY.
NOW WE HAVE ONE SHOWDOWN,
DOMENICK VERSUS WENDELL.
NOT ONLY WILL YOU WIN IMMUNITY
AND BE SAFE, YOU WILL GO TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL SECOND AND HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE OF INFORMATION.
I WANT THAT NECKLACE.
WELL, YOU GOT TO STAND UP
HERE FOR ANOTHER THUNDERSHOWER
GET THAT NECKLACE.
THAT'S FINE, I DON'T CARE.
SORRY, GUYS.
HE'S STUBBORN.
I'M STUBBORN.
I GOT NOWHERE TO GO.
NEITHER DO I, JEFF.
Jeff: WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE
OVER 30 MINUTES NOW.
WENDELL WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT,
BUT THAT BALL IS NOT MOVING.
JUST END IT ALREADY.
STOP THE NONSENSE.
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
Jeff: DOMENICK TRYING TO
SEIZE WITH IT THE VERBAL
ASSAULT.
I GOT EIGHT BROTHERS AND
SISTERS.
WE KILL EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST
CHICKEN NUGGET AT THE DINNER
TABLE, JEFF.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
UH-OH.
IT'S STARTING.
I'M CHILLING.
I'M CHILLING.
Jeff: FIRST BIT OF
MOVEMENT.
DON'T LET IT GO.
Jeff: DOMENICK WITH HIS
FIRST MOVEMENT.
WOW, THAT GOT A LOOK FROM
WENDELL.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW
SINCE DAY ONE.
I'M PUTTING THIS NECKLACE ON
TONIGHT.
THIS IS MINE.
MY WIFE AND KIDS ARE SITTING ON
THAT BENCH WATCHING ME RIGHT
NOW.
I AIN'T LOSING.
GLEN'S MY LUCKY COLOR.
Jeff: GOOD.
DOMENICK VERSUS WENDELL FOR ALL
THE MARBLES.
THIS IS JUST SHEER WILL.
MORE MOVEMENT FROM WENDELL.
BODY SHAKING.
FOREARMS BURNING.
GOOD LUCK, DOM.
Jeff: WENDELL DROPS OUT.
DOMENICK WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL AND EARNS THE RIGHT FOR
ORANGE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
SECOND, SEEING WHAT PURPLE DOES
WHEN THEY GO FIRST.
CHELSEA, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
 GOOD JOB, CHELSEA.
Jeff: SECOND TIME IN A ROW.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT.
DOMENICK, COME ON OVER.
DOMENICK SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
GOOD JOB, DOM.
Jeff: CHELSEA CANNOT BE
VOTED OUT.
DOMENICK CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.
SADLY JENNA, ACCEPT, ANGELA,
DONATHAN, YOU'LL GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL FIRST WHERE ONE OF THE
FOUR OF YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
THEN KELLYN, MICHAEL, LAUREL,
WENDELL, ONE OF YOU WILL BE
VOTED OUT.
TWO PEOPLE GOING HOME TONIGHT,
TWO DREAMS COMING TO AN END.
IT WILL NOT BE CHELSEA.
IT WILL NOT BE DOMENICK.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK THE TRIBAL.
SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT.
CONGRATS.
CONGRATS.
I HAD TO WIN THIS ONE, AND I
DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT HAPPENED.
AND NOW I'M UP AGAINST THREE
ORIGINAL NAVITI.
I NEED TO TRY AND FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, BECAUSE I DO NOT
WANT TO GO HOME TONIGHT.
LOOKING A LITTLE LIKE DEEÉJAAÀ
VU.
CHELS.
CONGRATS.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE A TRUE WARRIOR.
YOU GUYS ARE SO SWEET.
CHELSEA, DOM, GOOD JOB.
APPRECIATE IT.
THAT WAS HARD.
GOING INTO TRIBAL TONIGHT, WE
HAVE TWO GROUPS OF FIVE.
FIRST ONE IS CHELSEA, DONATHAN,
JENNA, SEBASTIAN AND ANGELA.
THAT WAS DEFINITELY A TWIST,
YOU GUYS, THAT I DIDN'T SEE.
THAT WAS SCARY.
"SURVIVOR" SLAPPED US
TONIGHT.
I'M SET UP ON MY TEAM WITH
MYSELF, WENDELL, LAUREL,
MICHAEL, AND KELLYN.
CONGRATS.
SO THAT'S HOW IT FEELS?
SO GOING INTO TONIGHT THE PLAN
IS TO PUT VOTES ON MICHAEL.
IT SHOULD BE EASY NOW.
WE CAN GET RID OF HIM.
IT SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.
WHAT'S BEEN THE BEACH TALK IN
WHAT'S GOING ON FOR YOU GUYS?
WELL, I HATE THE PLAY MY IDOL
TONIGHT, AND THAT'S THE ONE
DECISION I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY
MIND ABOUT YET.
COMING BACK THE CAMP, I KNOW
IT'S PROBABLY ME GOING HOME, SO
I WANTED TO TALK TO DONATHAN AS
SOON AS I COULD, BECAUSE
DONATHAN HAS AN IDOL, AND IN MY
EYE, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ONE OF
THE ONLY OPTIONS I HAVE LEFT.
COULD I ASK A FAVOR OF YOU?
WHAT?
SINCE WE'RE IN SEPARATE
TRIBALS TONIGHT, WOULD YOU LET
ME BORROW IT JUST FOR LIKE THE
NEXT HOUR TO SHOW ONE OF THEM SO
THEY THINK I HAVE ONE?
NO.
YOU WOULDN'T?
NO?
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT
LINKED BACK TO ME.
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T SEE HOW
IT WOULD.
NO ONE SUSPECTS...
IT'S IN MY BAG AND I HAVE IT
PACKED AWAY.
EVEN THOUGH I LIKE MICHAEL, I
CAN'T GIVE MICHAEL MY IDOL.
I'M OUT HERE THE PLAY FOR ME AND
WIN $1 MILLION.
I HAVE TO PUT MY BEST
INTERESTS FIRST.
I NEVER WANT TO LET IT SLIP I
HAVE AN IDOL.
I'M HAVING MY OWN PITY PARTY.
DONATHAN GAVE ME A PRETTY
REPUBLICAN AND SIMPLE ANSWER,
BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
HEARD SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S A HUGE RISK
TO LIE, IF I SAY I HAVE AN IDOL,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT
TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY JUST
TO SAVE MYSELF FOR ONE MORE
NIGHT.
IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, IT WILL
BE PRETTY FREAKIN' SWEET.
I HAVE TO REALLY TRUST YOU
100%.
CAN I?
I HAVE AN IDOL.
I'M PLAYING IT REGARDLESS.
I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.
HOLY COW.
HE HAS AN IDOL.
I'M LIKE, DARN IT.
IT FEELS LIKE THINGS ARE MORE
DANGEROUS NOW THAN THEY EVER
HAVE BEEN.
TONIGHT IF WE CAN DO THIS, I
AM WITH YOU FOR THE LONG HAUL.
I HAVE NOT HAD --
 I'M WITH YOU FOR THE
LISTENING HAUL IF THIS HAPPENS.
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
I FEEL LIKE SHE DOES BELIEVE
I HAVE THE IDOL.
I CONVINCED HER THAT I AM
PLAYING IT TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE REALLY DIDN'T
ALL I CAN I THINK, AND AT THIS
POINT, YOU KNOW, IT'S HALI MARY.
I HOPE MY WORK PAYS OFF.
I HOPE I STAY ANOTHER DAY.
YOU'RE NOT TELLING LAUREL YOU
HAVE THE IDOL, RIGHT?
GOD NO.
WE'RE GOOD.
MICHAEL HAS FOUND TWO IDOLS
ALREADY IN THIS GAME, SO IT'S
POSSIBLE HE HAS ANOTHER ONE.
I'M REALLY WORRIED IF MICHAEL
PUTS HIS VOTE ON ME, I'M GOING
HOME.
HE SAYS HE HAS AN IDOL.
HE DOESN'T.
ARE YOU SURE?
I PROMISE YOU.
LOOK AT MY FACE.
I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS PULLING
THE WOOL OVER MY EYES.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
HE SAID HE FOUND IT THE DAY
AFTER --
TELL HIM TO SHOW IT TO YOU.
SHOW IT TO ME.
I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.
KELLYN MAY BE LOSING IT,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MICHAEL
HAS AN IDOL, SO IT'S RISKY, BUT
I'M VOTING FOR MICHAEL.
THIS GUY JUST WON'T GO AWAY.
WE NEED TO GET RID OF MICHAEL.
I DON'T BUY IT.
LOOK, I'M NOT A GENIUS, BUT I'M
A PRETTY GOOD READ.
I DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS ANYTHING.
DOMENICK IS REASSURING ME
THAT I'M STILL SAFE.
BUT I'M JUST SO WORRIED THAT
MICHAEL HAS YET ANOTHER IDOL.
I AM SCARED IT MIGHT BE ME
TONIGHT, CHELSEA.
WHY?
MICHAEL, MR. IDOL FINDER.
IT JUST FEELS LIKE HE HAS ONE.
I DON'T KNOW.
TRULY IT DOES.
I'VE BEEN THINKING I MIGHT VOTE
LAUREL.
A VOTE FOR LAUREL SEEMS LIKE A
SAFER BET BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
SHE HAS AN IDOL.
AS LONG AS WENDELL FEELS GOOD
WITH ME, WE CAN KEEP NAVITI
TOGETHER.
HE HAS AN IDOL.
AND HE IS PLAYING HIS IDOL
TONIGHT NO MATTER WHAT.
HE IS ACTING LIKE HE HAS ONE.
THAT SOUNDS BELIEVABLE.
YEP.
BUT...
I BELIEVE HIM.
ARE WE WILLING THE SACRIFICE
LAUREL IF HE DOES HAVE THAT
IDOL?
KELLYN, WHO GETS SUPER
EMOTIONAL, WANTS TO PLACE A VOTE
ON LAUREL, BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT LAUREL HAPPENS TO BE MY
ALLY, SO I NEED TO TALK TO
LAUREL AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HER, BECAUSE WE NEED SOME
KIND OF A PLAN.
TODAY IT DOES SEEM LIKE MICHAEL
HAS GIVEN UP OR HE HAS
SOMETHING.
SO IF HE PULLED OUT AN IDOL,
THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
IF YOU VOTE FOR KELLYN, SHE
GOES HOME.
AND IF I DIDN'T, I GO HOME.
MICHAEL HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO
BE A FIERCE COMPETITOR, SO IT
MAKES SENSE TO VOTE FOR MICHAEL,
BUT IF HE PULLS OUT AN IDOL, I
VERY WELL COULD BE GOING HOME.
IT'S FRUSTRATING KNOWING MY GAME
COMES DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT
MICHAEL HAS AN IDOL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
DO?
I'M NOT THINKING CLEAR BECAUSE
I'M STRESSED OUT BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT KELLYN OUT.
SHE CAN GO WHENEVER IF YOU
ASK ME.
WENDELL AND DOMENICK ARE TWO
OF MY CLOSEST ALLIES OUT HERE.
I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW THEY NEED
TO PROTECT ME THROUGH THIS NEXT
VOTE AND VOTE FOR KELLYN,
BECAUSE KELLYN COULD TRY TO FLIP
ON ME AND GET ME OUT.
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO VOTE
FOR KELLYN BECAUSE IT'S THE
SAFEST THING FOR ME.
TONIGHT IT SHOULD BE SUCH A
STRAIGHT SHOT.
I WOULD LIKE THE SEE MICHAEL
GOING TO, BUT IF I HAVE TO VOTE
FOR KELLYN IN ORDER TO SAVE
LAUREL, I'M WILLING TO DO THAT.
I FEEL SO GOOD.
I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING DOWN,
AND I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH ON
THIS ALL DAY.
I HAVE MY SECRET ADVANTAGE THAT
I WON AT GHOST ISLAND, SO I HAVE
AN EXTRA PIECE OF PARCHMENT
WHERE I CAN CROSS OUT
McKAYLA'S NAME AND WRITE DOWN
SOMEONE ELSE, AND ONE EXTRA VOTE
IS A HUGE POWER.
SO I'M GOING TO USE MY EXTRA
VOTE TONIGHT, AND PUT TWO VOTES
ON LAUREL, JUST IN CASE MICHAEL
DOES HAVE AN IDOL.
IT SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD,
RIGHT?
I'M IN THE LOOKING TO DO
ANYTHING CRAZY.
I WANT...
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD MAKE
SURE OUR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
TODAY HAS BEEN SUPER BUSY.
LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS, LOTS OF
PEOPLE WALKING AWAY, BECAUSE
THERE WILL BE TWO TRIBAL
COUNCILS TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE ON OUR HIT
LIST, SO MY HOPE IS THAT WE
COULD TAKE BOTH OF THEM OUT IN
ONE NIGHT.
BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE OUT HERE.
I'M WILLING TO TAKE RISKS OUT
HERE TO PROTECT MY ALLIANCE.
I'M SAYING THAT IF WE'RE
GOING TO DO IT...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON ON THAT SIDE, BUT OBVIOUSLY
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.
YEAH.
THE FIVE PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE
ARE ME, CHELSEA, ANGELA,
DONATHAN, AND JENNA.
THAT'S TWO MALOLO, THREE NAVITI.
WE'VE LITERALLY HAD THE NUMBERS
SINCE DAY ONE.
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
JENNA IS GOING HOME, RIGHT?
YEAH.
YEAH.
I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO BE
SUPER FREAKING CONVINCING.
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR
JENNA, AND TELL HER THAT WE'RE
ALL VOTING FOR DONATHAN STRAIGHT
UP.
THERE'S JUST SO MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS RUNNING THROUGH
MY HEAD, LIKE WHAT ARE YOUR
OPPORTUNITY AND YOUR CHANCES OF
GOING HOME TONIGHT?
I'M ON THE SAME TRIBE WITH
DONATHAN, WHO HAS THE IDOL.
WE'RE DOWN ON NUMBERS.
BEING FROM MALOLO, WE KNOW WE'RE
ON THE BOTTOM.
WE KNOW WE'RE ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
SO I ASSUME THAT IT'S ME OR
DONATHAN.
I THINK SHE WAS GOING TO COME
DOWN IN A LITTLE BIT.
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN VOTE
DONATHAN.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
WE'RE VOTING FOR DONATHAN.
HE'S THAT SWING VOTE THAT NOBODY
WANTS HERE.
THIS IS WHERE RELATIONSHIPS
DO COME INTO PLAY.
CHELSEA AND SEBASTIAN SEEM TO BE
WILLING TO KEEP ME AROUND AGAIN,
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE DONATHAN
THINKS IT'S ME SO HE DOESN'T
PLAY HIS IDOL ON HIMSELF
TONIGHT, BECAUSE IF HE DOES,
THAT MEANS I'M GOING HOME AND I
DO NOT WANT THAT.
SEBASTIAN IS LIKE WE'RE VOTING
YOU.
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
I KNOW.
THIS IS THE GAME.
IT'S FRUSTRATING.
BUT JUST KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
AND I'M GLAD WE GOT TO PLAY THIS
GAME TOGETHER.
SEBASTIAN SAID THAT HE'S
GOING TO VOTE JENNA OUT.
I HAVE MY IDOL, SO I CAN FEEL
LIKE I'M SAFE, BUT I'D HATE TO
SEE JENNA GO.
MAYBE I CAN SAVE HER TONIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'M TRYING TO GET WENDELL OR
DOMENICK TO MAKE A MOVE ON
KELLYN.
I'M NOT SURE IF I WANT TO
PLAY IT ON ME OR JENNA.
IT'S NERVE-RACKING FOR ME.
LAUREL, SHE'S MY GREATEST ALLY
OUT HERE.
SHE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE LAUREL COULD
ACTUALLY GO TONIGHT, AND THAT
TERRIFIES ME.
MALOLO HAS HAD TO STRUGGLE
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE THING.
I WOULD HATE TO SEE JENNA GO, AS
WELL.
THIS GAME, THIS GAME.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
SEBASTIAN -- I MAY USE IT ON
YOU.
ARE YOU WILLING TO PLAY THAT
IDOL?
IF YOU'RE 100% WITH ME RIGHT
NOW.
WRITE DOWN.
YOU'LL FIND OUT?
I DID A GOOD JOB LYING.
DONATHAN WAS WILLING THE PLAY AN
IDOL FOR ME.
HE'S AN IDIOT AND I'M WILLING TO
VOTE HIM OUT, SO I HAVE TO ACT
SURPRISED WHEN HE GETS SENT TO
THE JURY.
I'M SUPER GRATEFUL THAT HE'S
WILLING TO PLAY IT ON ME.
I TOLD JENNA THAT I'D PLAY
THAT IDOL ON YOU TONIGHT, FLU
ARE SO MANY VARIABLES IN THIS
GAME.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT MY GUT TELLS
ME AT TRIBAL TONIGHT.
IT'S A HUGE RISK FOR MY GAME,
BUT I THINK ABOUT HOW IT WAS
BETWEEN TAI AND SCOT, WHO DIDN'T
SAVE A FRIEND.
I INTEND TO REVERSE THE CURSE
FOR MALOLO.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS, LIBBY, AND DESIREE VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO DONATHAN, HUGE TWIST TODAY.
DEFINITELY.
Jeff: YOU GUYS ARE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEMPORARY TRIBES.
YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO TRIBAL.
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE QUESTION
I'M GOING TO ASK.
IT SHOOK THINGS UP AT CAMP.
ME AND JENNA IS HERE.
WE HAVE THREE NAVITI AROUND US.
SO WE'RE BACK WHERE WE WAS FROM
THE START.
Jeff: SO SEBASTIAN, IS IT A
PRETTY SIMPLE VOTE, THE NAVITI
ARE GOING TO STICK TOGETHER AND
MALOLO IS IN TROUBLE?
YEAH, MALOLO'S BEEN GETTING
THE LOW END OF THE STICK SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME, AND
YOU HAVE TO FEEL WAD FOR THEM,
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN
DO, SO, YEAH, IT'S PRETTY
OBVIOUS.
THERE'S THREE AND A HALF
INFORMATION AND TWO MALOLO HERE.
Jeff: AND YET IF YOU LOOK
AT THE JURY, THAT HASN'T BEEN
THE CASE.
THERE'S TWO NAVITI AND ONE
MALOLO.
SO JENNA, DID THERE SEEM TO BE
ANY CRACKS THAT YOU COULD TRY TO
GET INTO?
NO CRACKS.
THE NAVITI ARE STAYING STRONG.
AND IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT
I'M THE ONE GOING HOME TONIGHT.
I'M READY TO VOTE.
Jeff: WOW.
MEANING YOU'RE DONE?
I'M NOT DONE, BUT I'VE BEEN
ON THE BOTTOM THIS WHOLE TIME,
AND TODAY I WAS SUPER EXCITED
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF TWO
DIFFERENT TRIBAL, BUT IT'S THE
SAME NAVITI STRONG.
EVERYONE IS HONEST AN UP FRONT
AT CAMP.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, WHEN YOU
HEAR, THAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE,
WOW, I THOUGHT YOU'D FIGHT A
LITTLE HARDER.
YEAH, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
THAT SHE SAID THAT.
YOU WANT TO FIGHT TO STAY IN
THIS GAME.
THAT'S A VERY BLUNT STATEMENT TO
MAKE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
Jeff: DONATHAN, HEARING
JENNA SAY IT'S ME AND I'M READY,
IS THERE A PART OF YOU THAT
SAYS, OKAY, AT LEAST I'M STILL
ALIVE.
IT DOES, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS
TRICKS UP PEOPLE'S SLEESMS YOU
NEVER KNOW IF THEY ARE TELLING
YOU YOU'RE STAYING, BUT JENNA
COULD GET THE SURPRISE OF HER
LIFE AND IT COULD BE ME GOING
TONIGHT.
Jeff: CHELSEA, WHY WOULD
THAT MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU HAVE A
3-2?
IS IT BECAUSE THE CONCERN OF
IDOLS?
WHEN YOU HAVE A 3-2 SPLIT,
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO
SAVE YOURSELF IF EITHER OF THESE
TWO HAD AN IDOL.
ESSENTIALLY IF YOU VOTE WRONG,
ONE OF THE NAVITI THREE THAT YOU
THINK ARE STRONG IS NOW GOING
HOME.
Jeff: SO DONATHAN, WHAT DID
YOU DO THIS AFTERNOON TO TRY TO
SWITCH THE NAVITI AND MAKE
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN?
I THINK THAT THESE THREE
NAVITIS MIGHT BE SCARED TO RUB
SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THE WRONG
WAY, SO THAT'S WHY ME AND JENNA
ARE HOPELESS TONIGHT.
Jeff: AND JENNA, THAT
BRINGS US BACK TO YOU AND WHY
YOU FEEL YOU HAVE NO CHANCE.
YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY A
MALOLO TONIGHT.
JUST BASED OFF OF CONVERSATIONS
I HAD, MY SUSPICIONS ARE IT'S
ME.
Jeff: SO IS THIS REALLY ALL
WE NEED AT TRIBAL?
ARE YOU GUYS REALLY READY TO
VOTE?
WOW.
THIS MAY BE THE FEWEST QUESTIONS
I'VE EVER ASKED AT A TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
JEFF.
OH, MY GOD.
OKAY.
SO THIS IS THE SUPER IDOL.
THIS IS THE ONE THAT SCOT HAD,
AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT TAI
HAD.
THEY DIDN'T GET TO COMPLETE
THEIR SUPER IDOL THEN, AND I
COMPLETE THESE TWO NOW.
AND IT CREATES A REGULAR IDOL,
AND I'M GOING TO SAVE IT.
SORRY, JENNA.
I'M PLAYING THIS FOR MYSELF
TONIGHT.
Jeff: OKAY.
THANKS, DONATHAN.
WHEN COMBINED THESE TWO DO FORM
AN IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DONATHAN WILL
NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DONATHAN.
DOES NOT COUNT.
SEBASTIAN.
THAT'S ONE VOTE SEBASTIAN.
JENNA.
ONE VOTE ACCEPT, ONE VOTE JENNA.
JENNA.
THAT'S TWO VOTES JENNA, ONE VOTE
SEBASTIAN, ONE VOTE LEFT.
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
JENNA.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JENNA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
JENNA, TONIGHT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
SPOT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE JURY
NEXT TO DESIREE.
IT'S OKAY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOUR WORK HERE IS DONE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
WE'LL BRING IN THE NEXT TRIBE.
GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT, AND WE
WILL GET STARTED.
Jeff: SO LET'S START WITH
FIRST BIG NEWS.
YOU'RE GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK.
JENNA JUST VOTED OUT.
LAUREL, WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO
YOU?
IT SUCKS TO SEE JENNA OVER,
THERE BECAUSE IT SHOWS NAVITI
CONTINUES THE PLAY THE SAME GAME
THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE WE
GOT HERE.
WE'RE IN THE SAME POSITION.
I COME HERE EVERY DAY AND SAY
THE SAME THING AND IT'S THE SAME
STORY TODAY.
Jeff: AND YET DOMENICK JUST
LUCK OF DRAW, NAVITI ONCE AGAIN
ON PAPER HAS THE NUMBERS.
IT WAS CRAZY.
WE DID A COMPLETELY RANDOM DRAW
FOR TWO TEAMS, AND ONCE AGAIN
NAVITI HAD THE MAJORITY ON BOTH
SIDES.
IT'S JUST BEEN THE STORY THIS
ENTIRE SEASON.
Jeff: AND WENDELL, IS IT
THAT SIMPLE?
IT'S EITHER MICHAEL OR LAUREL
AND JUST KEEP IT CLEAN?
THAT'S THE EASY MOVE.
Jeff: KELLYN, DOES THAT
MEAN IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE?
YOU'RE PLAYING "SURVIVOR."
DO YOU THINK THE EASY MOVE IS
EVER THE RIGHT MOVE?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SOUNDS EASY, RIGHT?
AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE
IDOL KING SITTING OVER THERE,
AND SO THEN YOU HAVE TO COUNT
NUMBERS, AND IT'S SCARY.
I AM SITTING HERE VERY, VERY
SCARED.
Jeff: WENDELL, IS THIS A
LITTLE BIT LIKE ANIMALS IN THE
JUNGLE WITH THE PREDATOR AND
PREY.
THEY GET SO GOOD THAT THEY CAN
SENSE WHEN SOMETHING IS OFF.
IS THAT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE
TALKING ABOUT, THAT ALL OF THIS
CENTERS AROUND WHETHER OR NOT
YOU BEREAVE ONE PERSON HAS AN
IDOL AND SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
STUDYING HIM TO DETERMINE IF
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT?
ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.
ALL EYES HAVE BEEN ON MIKE
FEDERAL DAY ONE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE KID,
FIRST OF ALL.
OF COURSE.
YOU CAN AT LEAST OWN THAT.
THANK YOU, KELLYN.
Jeff: DOMENICK, YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
I WANT TO MENTION TO THE
PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT, I
KNOW MICHAEL HAS A STRONG
HISTORY OF IDOLS OF FINDING
IDOLS, BUT I THINK WE SHOULDN'T
PANIC.
I'M STICKING TO MY GAME PLAN,
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.
AND I DON'T BRIEF HE HAS IT.
Jeff: MICHAEL, WHAT WOULD
BE THE LOGIC OF SHOWING HIM THE
IDOL GIVEN THAT THERE ARE FIVE
AND THE ONLY OTHER CHOICE IS
LAUREL?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOGIC.
MAYBE TO SWAY THE VOTE.
OTHER THAN THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.
I MEAN, THE PREY CAN TELL THAT
PREDATORS ARE OUT THERE, AND I
THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D
WANT THE KEEP ON THE LOW AND
JUST PLAY THE SECURE MYSELF FOR
ONE MORE TIME.
FAIR ENOUGH.
Jeff: LAUREL, PUTS YOU IN A
REALLY INTERESTING POSITION,
BECAUSE ALL EYES ARE FOCUSED ON
MICHAEL, BUT THERE IS THIS
QUESTION: WHAT IF HE DOES HAVE
AN IDOL.
SO ON THE ONE HAND YOU COULD
JOIN NAVITI AND SAY, I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU TELL ME.
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU MIGHT BE
THE PREY.
FIRST OF ALL, I'M JEALOUS
THAT NO ONE HAS CALLED ME PRETTY
TONIGHT.
I WISH I WAS GETTING SOME
COMPLIMENTS, BUT I SAW WHAT
HAPPENED TO LIBBY LAST TIME THEY
TRIED THE TAKE A SHOT AT HIM AND
THEY MISSED.
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE SAME
POSITION.
MY GAME HINGES UPON THEIR READ
ON MICHAEL.
Jeff: WENDELL, DO YOU WORRY
IF YOU ARE WRONG TONIGHT IT
COULD BUST YOUR GAME UP?
ABSOLUTELY.
IF WE SHOOT THE WRONG WAY AND AN
INNOCENT BYSTANDER GETS HIT,
KIND OF LIKE A LIBBY, THERE ARE
IMPLICATIONS AND THERE ARE
THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN DOWN THE
LINE.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO SHOOT THE
BEST SHOT TONIGHT.
Jeff: KELLYN, THIS IS THE
KIND OF MOMENT YOU DREAM OF WHEN
YOU DREAM OF PLAYING "SURVIVOR."
A HUGE QUESTION IN THE AIR.
WE HAVE TO BE RIGHT, OR WE'RE
WRONG.
AND RIGHT AWAY DOM IS TALKING TO
WENDELL.
THERE IS NO CERTAINTY.
HOPEFULLY THEY'RE JUST
SINGING THE A, B, Cs, BECAUSE
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOLDEN.
Jeff: DOES THIS MAKE YOU
NERVOUS?
I WAS NERVOUS ALREADY BEFORE.
I'M STILL NERVOUS.
THERE IS A ONE IN FOUR SHOT OF
GOING HOME RIGHT NOW.
ONE IN FOUR SHOT.
Jeff: SO FAR YOU'RE NOT
INCLUDED IN THE NAVITI
CONVERSATION.
WOW, LAUREL.
NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
MALOLO PERSON.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS BACK AT
CAMP.
THEY POWWOW.
I'M GUESSING THEY'RE GOING BACK
AND FORTH ON WHETHER OR NOT
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE SHOT
AT MICHAEL.
I FEEL LIKE THEY WERE SAYING
THEY WERE COMING IN TAKING THE
SHOT.
THEY HAD TO POWWOW.
THEY PROBABLY CHANGED THEIR
MIND.
SO RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING LIKE
IT'S ME.
Jeff: KELLYN, IF "SURVIVOR"
IS A ROLLER COASTER, WHERE ARE
WE ON THE RIDE?
HOW I FEEL IS WE'RE IN THE
LOOP AND I'M HANGING UPSIDE
DOWN, VERY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,
AND UNTIL SOMEONE COMES AND
PUSHES US FOR THE REST OF THE
RIDE, I QUESTIONS WE'RE JUST
WAITING FOR THIS NEXT VOTE.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
LAUREL, YOU'RE UP.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE KELLYN.
WENDELL.
LAUREL.
MICHAEL.
ONE VOTE WENDELL, ONE VOTE
LAUREL, ONE VOTE MICHAEL, ONE
VOTE KELLYN.
MICHAEL.
THAT'S TWO VOTES MICHAEL, ONE
VOTE WENDELL, ONE VOTE LAUREL,
ONE VOTE KELLYN.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
LAUREL.
WE'RE TIED.
THAT'S TWO VOTES LAUREL, TWO
VOTES MICHAEL.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REVOTE.
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.
LAUREL AND MICHAEL, YOU WILL NOT
VOTE.
DOMENICK, WENDELL, KELLYN, YOU
CAN ONLY VOTE FOR ONE OF THOSE
TWO.
DOMENICK, YOU'RE UP.
COME GRAB THE URN.
THERE WERE SIX VOTES.
I HAD AN EXTRA VOTE.
SOMEONE HAD AN EXTRA VOTE.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
MICHAEL.
ONE VOTE MICHAEL.
12th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
MICHAEL.
THAT'S TWO.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
APPRECIATE IT.
LOVE YOU, BUD.
Jeff: MICHAEL, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
IT'S BEEN ONE HELL OF A TIME,
GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
TAKE CARE, BROTHER.
Jeff: WELL EVERYBODY WHO
COULD RECEIVE VOTES RECEIVED
VOTES, AND WITH THE REST OF YOUR
TRIBE WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP, IT SHOULD MAKE FOR SOME
INTERESTING CAMPFIRE STORIES
TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
"SURVIVOR," THE MAJORITY'S ON
THIN ICE.
HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE, WHICH
PISSES ME OFF.
THE HAPPY NAVITI FAMILY HAS
COME TO AN END.
Jeff: BUT BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN WATER.
WHAT IF YOU COULD SHARE THIS
MOMENT WITH THE PEOPLE YOU ARE
PLAYING FOR?
WE'RE TALKING LOVE.
EVEN THOUGH I CAME UP SHORT,
I CAN LOOK BACK AND BE PROUD OF
THE GAME I PLAYED.
I AM THE YOUNGEST GUY OUT HERE,
AND LITTLE DID THEY KNOW THEY
GOT FOOLED EACH TIME A BY AN 18
YEAR OLD.
AT 18 YEARS OLD, I FEEL LIKE MY
LIFE IS JUST BEGINNING.
I'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW FOR SO
LONG, AND TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE
LIKE THIS IS PRICELESS.
