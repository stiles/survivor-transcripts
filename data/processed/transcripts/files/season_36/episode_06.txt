        PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR.
MALOLO LOST THEIR FIFTH
COMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
NIFTYI WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
MALOLO BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MICHAEL AND JAMES WERE
OUTNUMBERED.
HOPEFULLY I CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THIS.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, MICHAEL
TURNED ON AN ALLY TO STAY ALIVE.
JAMES, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
BUT IT STILL LEFT HIM ON THE
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.
14 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT.
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS UTTERLY
DEPRESSING, TO BE HONEST.








I GOT RID OF JAMES TO SAVE
MYSELF.
BUT YOU KNOW SHALL I'VE GOT TO
DO WHAT I HAVE GOT TO DO TO GET
BY.
AND NOW I AM LAST ON MALOLO, I
AM WORRIED I COULD BE NEXT, THAT
IS THREE VOTES HAVE BEEN MALOLO
PLAYERS.
FINDING AN ALLY IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING-- FINDING AN A
DOLL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN MY GAME RIGHT NOW.
ON THE BEACH.
PROBABLY LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.
AT THIS POINT I'M NOT TOO
WORRIED ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT.
I'M GOING TO BE AGGRESSIVE.
I'MING TO GO OUT AND TEAR THIS
ISLAND APART IF I HAVE TO, I'M
DIGGING WITH A STICK THROUGH
ROCKS, LITTLE BY LITTLE AND CHIP
AWAY, TRY AND SEARCH EACH PEACE
OF THIS ISLAND TO TRY AND FIND








SOMETHING.
IS HE SEARCHING.
HE'S PARANOID AND CAN I SEE
HE IS PARANOID BECAUSE HE IS
RUNNING THROUGH THE JUNGLE.
IT IS THREE AGAINST ONE.
EASY PICKINGS..
SO WHEN I LOOKED OVER AROUND
THAT TREE STUMP, I FOUND THIS
GUY.
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND
IT.
I KNOW.
THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC FAKE
HID INIMMUNITY IDOL THAT ODDSY
CREATED IN SURVIVOR
MICRONEESHIA, OZZY HID THIS
CARVED STICK ON EXILE ISLAND.
JASON FOUND IT.
I GUESS THIS IS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY EYE DOLT.
BELIEVING IT TO BE A REAL
IDOL, WHEN JASON SHOWED IT TO
HER, ELIZA REALIZED IT WAS AN
OBVIOUS FAKE.
THAT IS NOT THE IDOL.
THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
ELIZA WAS VOTED O OUT THAT
NIGHT.
AND THE BAD LUCK CONTINUED.
OZZY WAS BLIND SIDED AT THE NEXT
TRIBAL WITH AN IDOL IN HIS
POCKET FOLLOW BY JASON VOTED OUT
AT THE NEXT TRIBAL WITH AN IDOL
IN HIS POCKET.
THE ONLY THREE PLAYERS TO EVER
TOUCH THE STICK WERE ALL VOTED
OUT.
BUT THERE IS A SECRET NOBODY
KNOWS.
FOR TEN YEARS THIS STICK HAS
BEEN LIVING ON GHOST ISLAND
SLOWLY GAINING PO WEMPLET AND AS
OF THIS MOMENT T HAS FULLY
MATURED INTO A REAL HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
I FEEL LIKE I LITERALLY REACHED
INTO MY TV SCREEN AND JUST
GRABBED THIS FROM OZZY'S HAND
AND I'M READY TO DO SOME DAMAGE
WITH THIS GUY.
COME ON IN, GUYS!
AND A HALFITI, GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW MALOLO
TRIBE, JAMES VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL YOU GUYS
READY TO GET TO THE REWARD
CHALLENGE.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU WILL
EACH PULL ON A ROPE SUSPENDING A
DISK AM WILL YOU THEN WORK
TOGETHER TO STACK BLOCKS ON THAT
DISK SPELLING REWARD.
IF YOUR STACK FALLS, YOU HAVE TO
START AGAIN.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH
WRITTEN REAWARDS, WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE PLAGUE, FIRST TRIBE

AS ELABORATE BUT NOT BAD.
CHICKEN KEBABS.
LAST TRIBE TO FINISH, NOTHING.
IN ADDITION, THE WINNING TRIBE
WILL SEND ONE PERSON FROM EITHER
OF THE TWO OTHER TRIBES TO GHOST
ISLAND.
A LOT AT STEAK, NAVITI, YOU HAVE
ONE EXTRA PERSON WHO IS GOING TO
SIT OUT OF THIS.
I WILL SIT OUT, JEFF.

STRATEGIZE, WE'LL GET STARTED. 
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARDS, SURVIVORS, READY.
GO!
YOU ARE SPELLING THE WARD
"REWARD" WITH A GHOST ISLAND
LOGO ON THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP.
AND YOU ARE SPELLING THE WORD
BACKWARDS.
A LITTLE MORE TENSION.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT
COMMUNICATION.
KEP AN EYE ON IT.
THE MORE YOU WORK TOGETHER
THE FASTER THIS WILL GO.
SLOW AND STEADY, SLOW AND
STEADY.
IT'S EASY IN THE BEGINNING.
IT ET GOES TOUGHER, THE HIGHER
THAT STACK IS.
THERE GOES LIBBY WITH THE R FOR
NAVITI.
YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR
ROBE.
YOU CAN ALREADY SEE IT
STARTING TO TILT FOR NIFTYI.
OH MY GOD, IT'S MOVING.
EASY GUYS.
YOU ARE GOOD.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
SEBASTIAN HAS THE W FOR
YANUYA.
HOLD IT JUST LIKE THAT.
KEL INNOW-- KELLYN NOW WITH
THE A, ARE YOU NEXT, JAMES.
YOU GOT THIS.
NOW DOWN TO CHELSEA WITH THE
TWO REMAINING BLOCKS FOR NIFTYI.
-- NIFERITI.
CHELSEA PLACES THE R IT IS
STARTING TO WOBEL.
NIVITI DROPS, THEY'VE GOT TO
START AGAIN, THAT OPENS THE DOOR
FOR YANUYA AND MALLOLA.
YANUYA HAS A BIG TIME ADVANTAGE
AS WENDELL PLACES THE R.
IANU-- YANUYARKS WITH JUST ONE
LAST BLOCK IT STACK, THE
GHOSTING WILLO ON TOP.
YOU ARE NOT A LITTLE TIGHTER.
PULL A LITTLE TIGHTER.
OH MY GOD.
YANUYA HAS TO START OVER.
HE ARE IN THE LEAD.
IT IS NOW MALOLO FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME IN THE
LEAD OF A CHALLENGE.
KELLYN PULL UP A LITTLE BIT.
WAIT, WAIT.
MALOLO DROPS, THEY'VE GOT TO
START AGAIN.
THIS CHALLENGE IS WIDE OPEN.
BRADLEY HEADING OUT FOR THAT
VITI, HE WILL RACE OUT T IS A
RISKY STRATEGY.
COULD IT PAY OFF RIGHT NOW?
YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR
ROPE.
GOOD JOB, LIBBY.
MORE TENSION.
YANUYA DOING THEIR BEST,
NAVITI STILL IN THE LEAD, ANY
REWARD IS NICE BUT STEAK IS
GREAT.
DAMN RIGHT, JEFF.
TRYING TO CATCH NAVITI.
ALL THREE TRIBES NOW KNOW THAT
EARLY YOU CAN RATE, YOU HAVE TO
TAKE YOUR TIME AS YOU GET DEEPER
IN THE CHALLENGE.
SEBASTIAN NOW BACK WITH THE E.
WE ARE NOW NECK AND NECK.
HERE COMES KINL, MALOLO IS
TAKING A LONG TIME WITH THEIR
EARLY LETTERS.
KELLYN, MAKE IT LOOSER.
I DON'T HAVE ANY TENSION.
DON'T-- I DON'T HAVE ANY.
OKAY.
SO MUCH TALKING AND ARGUING
THEY CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS.
WENDELL PLACES THE R FOR YANUYA.
YOU HAVE TO MOVE A LITTLE
FASTER.
LET'S GO, MAN.
ST NOW YANUYA BACK IN THE
LEADS WITH NA VIVI HAS TO GO FOR
BROKE, AND A HALFITI-- NAVITI
BALANCE ASKING THEIR STRAK, ONCE
AGAIN BACK EVEN, WENDELL REALLY
TAKING THEIR TIME.
LET'S GO WENDELL.
DONATHAN HEADING OUT NOW WITH
THE LAST BLOCK.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY IT AGAIN.
CAREFUL, DONATHAN, NO TENSION
ON THE ROPE.
DONATHAN, NO TENSION ON THE
ROPE.
I'M NOT, BRADLEY.
DONATHAN PLACES THAT TOP
ICON.
EVERYTHING ELSE LACKS GOOD.
IF HE CAN GET BACK, THIS WOULD
BE A BIG WIN FOR NAVITI, AND
THEY'RE GOT IT, NAVITI WINS
STEAK AND CHICKEN KEBABS, WE'RE
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE!
OH GOD!
I GOT YOU, BABE, I GOT YOU.
MALOLO AND YANUYA.
WENDELL WITH THE LAST ICON.
VERY EASY.
EASY, WENDZEL, WE GOT IT, WE
GOT IT.
THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT
PART NOW, GETTING BACK.
STAY IN THAT RHYTHM.
IT WOULD SEAL THE DEAL ON
ANOTHER LOSS FOR MALOLO.
TELL ME WHEN CAN I LET GO.
THE STORY OF THE SEASON SO
FAR.
A TRIBE THAT COULD VERY WELL
BE CURSED APPEARS TO BE CURSED.
MALOLO DROPPED, THEY HAVE GOT TO
START AGAIN.
WENDELL ONE FOOT IN THE PAINT.
KEEP THAT EX, EVERYBODY STAY
TIGHT.
ONE MORE FOOT TO GO.
THAT WILL DO IT, YOU'VE GOT IT.
MALOLO LOSES ONCE AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.
NICE REWARD FOR NAVITI, NICE
REWARD FOR YANUYA.
ONCE BIG DECISION, NAVITI YOU
ARE IN CHARGE OF WHO GOES TO
GHOST ISLAND, YOU EITHER MAKE A
YOU MAN NEWS AND SEND ONE PERSON
FROM EITHER OF THE TWO TRIBES
AND IF YOU CAN'T EVERYBODY ON
THE OTHER TWO TRIBES DRAWS ROCKS
WHICH MEANS IN THEORY SOMEBODY
FROMMIANUNYA WOULD GO TO GHOST
ISLAND AND NOT PARTICIPATE IN
THE REWARD THEY JUST WON.
VERY BIG DECISION.
STRATEGY PARAMOUNT RIGHT HERE.
AND BEFORE YOU TELL ME, WALK ME
THROUGH IT.
YEAH, I THINK GHOST ISLAND IS
STILL SOME WHAT OF A MYSTERY. 
SO WE WANT TO KEEP THAT MYSTERY
UNDER WRAPS.
AND SO SOMEBODY THAT HAS ALREADY
BEEN THERE WOULD BE A GOOD
CHOICE TO SEND AGAIN.
HAVE YOU MADE A UNANIMOUS
DECISION.
WE HAVE.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE.
KELLYN.
KELLYN, KELLYN, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, YOU WILL RETURN IN TIME
FOR THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
NAVITI,IANUYA, COME GRAB YOUR
REWARD.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
DESIREE, ANGELA, MICHAEL, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, BACK TO CAMP.
I WAS REALLY CONFIDENT IN
MYSELF, BUT HI BRADLEY.
BARKING ORDERS AT ME AND OH MY
GOD.
THE FIRE IN MY BODY WAS RAGING.
SO I'M JUST LETTING HIM DO HIS
OWN THING AND DIG HIS OWN GRAVE
OUT HERE.
WITHIN I'M WALKING INTO GHOST
ISLAND, FOR NOW MY SECOND
VISITED TO THE LAND OF THE
UNKNOWN.
BUT I HAVE ALREADY BEEN HERE
BEFORE SO I JUST NEED TO STAY
CALM, TAKE A MOMENT, TRUST MY
GUT AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE
WHAT IS BEST FOR MY GAME.
GAME ON, FOLLOW THE FIRE.
I OPEN UP THE UN, IT SAYS FOLLOW
THE FIRE.
AND MY HEART IS POUNDING AND I
FEEL LIKE THROWING UP, ST CRAZY
HOW IT FEELS LIKE OUT HERE IS
WHERE MY FATE OF MY GAME IS
LIVING.
OH, GHOST ISLAND GAME OF
CHANCE, THE ODDS HAVE IMPROVED
TWO OF THESE HOLD POWER.
RISK YOUR VOTE TO PLAY.
TWO THIRDS IS A CHANCE.
I FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT NOT PLAYING
LAST TIME.
MY FIRST TRIP TO GHOST ISLAND, I
JUST TRUSTED MY GUT AND DECIDED
TO PLAY IT SAFE, NOT PLAY THE
GAME, AND KEEP MY VOTE.
NOW WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE
MERGE.
YOU CAN TASTE THE FACT THAT IT
IS ALMOST AN INDIVIDUAL GAME AT
THIS POINT.
AND TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IS KEY.
GOT TO RISK FOR THE BUSINESS
KIT-- BISCUIT I GUESS, I DECIDE
I WILL PLAY THE GAME.
I JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF
THE LUCK OF THE SURVIVOR GODS ON
MY SIDE, PLEASE.
THIS GUY HAS BEEN TALKING TO ME
THE WHOLE TIME.
I FEEL LIKE I'M UNRAVELING MY
FATE.
I'M SUCH A WIMP.
YOU HAVE WON AN ADVANTAGE.
THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC STEAL A
VOTE THAT WAS USED TO VOTE OUT
MA CAY LA IN SURVIVOR 34 SEASON.
THIS IS THE ACTUAL AUTHENTIC
PIECE OF PARCHMENT THAT GOT
MAKAY DID LA VOTED OUT.
THIS IS WHAT WAS IN GAME
CLANGERS.
WHEN MAKAYLA WAS NOT CHOSEN TO
COMPETE IN THE REWARD CLAL ENG
SHE TOOK HER SPOT ON THE SIT OUT
BENCH.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING.
BLINDED BY FRUSTRATION SHE
NEVER SAW THE SECRET ADVANTAGE
SITTING AT HER FEET.
SARAH GRABS THE ADVANTAGE AND
USED IT TO VOTE OUT MAKAYLa.
14th PERSON VOTED OUT,
THE 7th MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
MAKAYLA.
THIS HAUNTED ADVANTAGE NO
LONGER HOLDS THE POWER TO STEAL
A VOTE BUT YOU CAN USE IT AS AN
EXTRA VOTE.
THAT'S HUGE.
THANK GODS I TRUSTED MY GUT
BECAUSE HAVING SECRET ADVANTAGE
IN MY POCKET RIGHT NOW SEEMS
JUST LIKE THE MOMENT WHERE MY
SURVIVOR LIFE IS GOING TO
CHANGE.
THIS COULD BE THE PIVOTAL POINT
WHERE KELLYN GOES FROM JUST
BEING THE SWEET GIRL WHO
EVERYONE LIKES TO BEING THE GIRL
WHO IS SMART ENOUGH AND TOUGH
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO
THE END AND WIN THIS GAME.
BOOM..
WE SMOKED THE OTHER TWO
TEAMS.
I FEEL VERY PROUD OF MYSELF.
THIS IS THE HIGHEST POINT THAT I
HAVE HAD SO FAR OUT HERE.
THIS TEAM CAN'T BE BROKEN.
OH MY GOD.
WE'RE EATING STEAK TONIGHT,
MY FRIENDS.
CAN WE CLEAR THE TABLE
PLEASE.
I'M READY TO BE EXCITED.
TALK ABOUT IT, KIND OF REMINISCE
ON WHAT JUST HAPPENED BECAUSE IT
WAS A GREAT MOMENT FOR ME.
PROUD OF YOU, BROTHER.
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS
PLEASE.
DONATHAN, YOU CAN HELP ME
MOVE THIS?
SOMEBODY.
I WILL DO IT.
IN MY NORMAL LIFE I JUST HAVE
NO PATIENCE.
SO TODAY WAS LIKE OH MY GOD,
LIKE LET'S EAT.
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT
THE BEGINNING PEOPLE ON THE
OUTSIDE.
WE MADE IT A WHOLE WORLD OF
DIFFERENCE.
I FEEL LIKE YOU WANTED TO
BUILD IT FIRST, BUDDY.
IT'S BUILT.
LET'S GO.
FOR ME THE HARDEST TEST OUT
HERE IS LIKE TO NOT BE A TOTAL
DICK BECAUSE HISTORICALLY IN MY
PERSONAL LIFE THAT'S BEEN WHAT
DERAILS IT ALL.
AND THEN LIKE I WON'T BE ABLE TO
GET BACK ON THE TRACK.
IT GOES ON AFTER I PUT IT ON,
RIGHT NOW.
SPRING TELL AGAIN.
DOES ANYONE CARE IF I GET
STUFF ON THERE WHEN I AM
SPRINKLING?
LET'S GO.
IT'S GETTING BAD.
IT IS GETTING BAD.
IT IS AMAZING THAT HE IS SUCH
A SMART PERSON AND PRETTY SMART
PLAYER BUT IS HE NOT AWARE THAT
HE IS A NASTY SON OF A BITCH.
HE LASHES OUT.
HE IS STILL BUILDING IT AND
YETING AT ME THAT I DIDN'T GET
THE FIRE STARTED.
YOU TOLD ME TO WAIT FOR YOU
TO FINISH.
I HAD IT TODAY.
I DIDN'T NEED HIM DOWN MY THROAT
LIKE THAT.
HE SAID IT LIKE FOUR TIMES.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE.
I WAS SO MAD.
THERE IS DIVISION ON NAVITI,
DHEL SEE, BRADLEY AND DOMINIC
AND THEN ME AND LIBBY ORIGINAL
MALOLOS.
IF THOSE THREE NAVITIS STICK
TOGETHER ME AND HER SON THE
BOTTOM.
BUT I FEAL LIKE WE IS KIND OF ON
THE SAME PAGE RIGHT NOW ABOUT
BRADLEY.
SO IF WE LOSE THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, I'M HOPING BRADLEY IS
THE TARGET.
WE HAVE TO TRY.
I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER,
IF IT COMES TO IT.
I THINK WE ARE ALL ON THE
SAME PAGE.
YEAH.
BRADLEY IS GETTING SNAPPY AND
PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE STARTING TO
SEE THAT AS WELL.
SO MAYBE I CAN WORK WITH THEM.
AND GET RID OF BRADLEY.
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
WORTH IT TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE I WANT TO STICK WITH
NAVITI.
IT IS NICE TO HAVE AN
AGREEMENT.
IT IS NICE.
YOU GUYS DID AWESOME.
GREAT JOB TODAY.
SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN
NOTHING.
WE CAME TOGETHER AND WE GOT
THE JOB DONE.
AND WE GOT FOOD.
WE WERE BUMMED WE DIDN'T COME
IN FIRST.
WE HAVE THE MINDSET OF A TEAM
THAT LIKES TO WIN AND WIN IT
ALL.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
GETTING ANYTHING, DIFFERENT AND
APPETIZING TO FILL YOUR STOMACH
IS A WIN.
IN IS ONION.
ESPECIALLY WHEN ARE YOU ONE
OF THE BIGGER GUYS LIKE ME WHO
HAVE TO EAT.
I LOVE TO EAT.
WE GOT THE WIN.
IT WAS A GREAT DAY.
THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK
ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY IS MY
GIRLFRIEND NICOLE, YOU KNOW, SHE
IS JUST THE GREATEST PERSON IN
THE WORLD.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR NICOLE.
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.
♪.
TODAY IS NICOLE'S BIRTHDAY SO
IT IS HARD TO NOT BE WITH HER ON
HER BIRTHDAY RIGHT NOW AND BE
OUT HERE.
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
BUT IT GAVE ME SOME KIND OF GRIT
TO REALLY WANT TO USE MY TIME TO
FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL FURTHER
MY GAME.
AND I KNOW THAT FOOD IS GOING TO
MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE TIRED.
SO WHEN THEY ARE KIND OF GOING
TO SLEEP, THAT IS MY OPPORTUNITY
RIGHT THERE TO SNEAK OFF, LOOK
FOR FIREWOOD BUT TO REALLY LOOK
FOR THE IDOL.
FROM THE FIRST TIME I STEPPED
ON THIS GIGANTIC ISLAND I TRIED
TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE TO EVERY
DETAIL, LANDMARKS, YOU KNOW,
THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HIDING
SPOTS FOR AN IDOL, OR A LITTLE
CLUE.
THERE IS ALOT OF DRIFTWOOD AND
TREES THAT ARE DEAD BUT I SEE A
TREE THAT I HAD SEEN BEFORE, IT
IS LIKE A REGULAR TREE BUT THEN
IT'S WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF
OTHER WEIRD MESH TYPE TREE BARK
SITUATION.
I LOOK AT, THAT I'M LIKE MAN F
THIS ISN'T A LANDMARK, NOTHING
ON THIS ISLAND IS A LANDMARK.
OH MY GOODNESS.
WHICH I FOUND A LITTLE-- AND
GREEN WRAPPING, I GRABBED T I AM
SOAKS SIELTSED.
I OPEN IT AND IT IS A CLUE TO AN
IDOL, WHICH IS A VERY BASIC MAP,
I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE
CLUEnd NOW I HAVE TO FIND
THE IDOL.
SO WE HAVE A PAIR OF TREES
RIGHT THERE.
WITH A MOUNTAIN RIGHT HERE.
AND THE WATER.
SO-- AT THE BASE OF A TREE, WITH
BABY ROOTS.
SO IT'S GOT TO BE THIS TREE.
IDOLS ARE WHAT YOU WANT IN
THIS GAME.
I NEED THIS THING.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT LIKE NOW IS
WHEN I HAVE TO FIND THIS THING.
THIS CAN GET ME TO THE END.
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOODNESS.
I PULL OUT THIS BIG GREEN
PACKAGE, AND I'M LIKE THIS IS IT
RIGHT HERE, THIS IS THE IDOL.
I OPEN IT UP-- OH MY GOD.
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL THING IS
WHAT I FIND.
THANK YOU, LORD.
THIS NECKLACE COULD BE THE
SINGLE MOST ICONIC RELIC IN THE
HISTORY OF SURVIVOR.
THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC
IMMUNITY NECKLACE-- NECKLACE
THAT ERIC GAVE AWAY TO NATIONAL
WILLEE IN SURVIVOR 16 SEASON.
ERIC, ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.
ERIC HAD MADE TO TO THE FINAL
FIVE AND HAD WON THIS IMMUNITY
NECKLACE WHICH GUARANTEED HIM A
SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR.
YOU THINK YOU COULD TALK HIM
INTO GIVING YOU THE NECKLACE.
WHO WOULD FALL FOR THAT.
BUT THE FOUR REMAINING WOMEN
BAM BOOZEELED HIM.
WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR
NECKLACE TONIGHT.
INTO GIVING UP THE NECKLACE
IN TRAIBAL COUNCIL.
I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.
AND PROMPTLY VOTED HIM OUT.
13th PERSON VOTED OUT,
ERIC.
BUT THERE IS A SECRET NOBODY
KNOWS, THIS NECKLACE HAS BEEN
LIVING ON GHOST ISLAND FOR A
DECADE T HAS MATURED INTO A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WITH THE
SAME POWERS AS ANY OTHER HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
THIS IS NOW NOT ERIC'S I MEW
IN-- IMMUNITY NECKLACE T ST A
HIDDEN IMMUNE IDENTITY IDOL.
WHEN I SAW SEASON 16 I THOUGHT
ERIC MADE THE MOST BONE HEADED
MOVE AND NOW HAVE I THAT MAN'S
IDOL AROUND MY NECK.
I MIGHT BE IN THAT POSITION AT
SOME POINT.
I WILL NEVER DO WHAT HE DID.
I GOT ONE.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.
I'M SUPER EXCITED TO HAVE THIS
THING.
I'M SO PROUD AND I WORKED HARPED
FOR IT THE CURSE WILL BE
REVERSED.
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT.
WE JUST HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR
ALL THE RAB IN THE BACK.
MALOLO IS CURSED.
WE'RE THE HUNGRIEST OUT HERE.
WE HAVEN'T WON A REWARD.
I'M STARVING, MY STOMACH FEELS
LIKE IT'S TOUCHING PIE BACK AND
WE'RE LOSING EACH AND EVERY
CHALLENGE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO SON THIS
TRIBE, EVEN IF WILL IS A SWITCH
OR A SWAP, WE LOSE.
THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST LOSING
TRIBE IN SURVIVOR HISTORY.
WE SHOULD BURN THE MALOLO,
THE LITTLE BANNER, WE NEED TO
BURN IT TO GET RID OF THE CURSE.
WAIT, RIGHT NOW?
YES, WE HAVE TO REVERSE THE
CURSE.
I DON'T WANT ANY REMNANTS OF
MALOLO NEAR ME AT ALL.
IT IS BAD JUJU, I DON'T WANT IT.
THERE SHE S THERE SHE IS.
, THERE SHE IS.
BREAK THIS CURSE GUISE,
SERIOUSLY.
THE CURSE IS BROKEN, Y'ALL.
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN ON A BIG
LOSING STREAK AND YOU KNOW
THAT'S HARD WHEN EACH TIME YOU
JUST GET BEAT BACK DOWN AM BUT
IF I HAVE FAITH THROUGH ALL THE
HARD TIMES, HOPEFULLY THERE IS
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
YAY.
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BRING IN KELLEN
RETURNING FROM GHOST ISLAND.
WELCOME BACK.
COME ON.
SHAKE IT OFF.
MICHAEL, GIVEN THAT OUT OF
SIX TRIBAL COUNCILS MALOLO HAS

OTHER.

NOBODY GOING HOME, SWIM OUT.
ALL RIGHT, NAVITI, TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT, SOMEBODY WILL
BE THE SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.
SWIM OUT, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
COUNCIL.
LOSING WAS REALLY TOUGH.
BUT BRADLEY HAS BEEN
DISRESPECTING EVERYBODY FROM OUR
TRIBE AND SOMEBODY LIKE THAT
DOESN'T DESERVE AN ALLIANCE.
SO I WANT HIM VOTED OUT.
WITHIN I WOULD JUST LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE IF I LET ANYONE DOWN
TOARKSD I WAS SO SMOKED AFTER
THAT SWIM.
I WENT IN THERE SHAKEN.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE WIN AS A TRIBE, WE LOSE AS
A TRIBE.
IT WAS NOT-- YOU CAN NOT TAKE.
I THINK MAYBE YOU HAD TOO
MUCH COFFEE.
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.
LIKE DO I KEEP THIS GUY AROUND.
BRADLEY CONSTANTLY TALKS DOWN TO
ME AS IF HE IS ABOVE ME AND
ABOVE EVERYONE IN THIS GAME.
BRADLEY, I JUST WANT TO DUMP
THIS IN.
I WOULD LIKE TO EAT MY RICE
FIRST.
BRADLEY IS A ANNE IN THE ASS
TO BE AROUND BUT FROM WHAT IT
APPEARS, HE IS WILLING TO WORK
WITH ME TO AT LEAST GET TO THE
END SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
MAKES SENSE FOR PIE GAME.
ALL-- I WILL TALK TO CHELSEA.
I'LL TALK TO LIBBY.
TONIGHT'S DECISION IS A
CHOICE OF WHICH ORIGINAL MALOLO,
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI THREE WANT
TO PICK OFF, SHOULD IT BE LIBBY
OR SHOULD IT BE DONATHAN,
DONATHAN IS HERE FOR A BEACH
VACATION WHERE WITH LIBBY SHE IS
INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE AND SHE
SMILES AND ARE YOU COMPELLED IT
BUY WHAT SHE IS SELLING AND THAT
IS SO DANGEROUS IN SURVIVOR.
LIB SEE WORRIES ME BECAUSE
SHE ALREADY PLAYED THE ORIGINAL
NAVITI TRIBE ONCE BECAUSE WHEN
SHES WITH GETTING HER TORCH
SNUFFED SHE SAID DON'T TRUST THE
WHROND.
I FEEL THRIEK IS INCREDIBLY
STRAIGHT FORWARD.
EVERYBODY IS VOTING FOR LIBBY
TONIGHT.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.
IT HAS BEEN GREAT TALKING TO
LIBBY.
BUT NICE TO MEET YOU, SEE YA.
I'M GIVING YOU MY WORD.
CHELSEA AND DOM TELL ME TO
VOTE BRADLEY OUT BUT PIE FEAR IS
THAT I GET VOTEED OUT.
I CAN'T HELP BUT BE NERVOUS.
DONATHAN AND I ARE ON THE
BOTTOM.
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL NERVOUS
ABOUT IT.
I WANT IT STAY IN THIS GAME SO
BADLY.
THIS IS A CRITICAL TRIBAL.
LIBBY THINKS WE'RE GOING WITH
BRADLEY TONIGHT BUT WE GOT A
LITTLE BIT OF A DECISION HERE.
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO A
MERGE.
YOU HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SURVIVOR IN
THIS GAME.
AND VOTING OUT BRADLEY, THAT IS
BETRAYING NAVITI, THE ORIGINAL
NAVITI, AND THAT IS HUGE.
DO YOU WANT TO DO BRADLEY OR
DO YOU WANT TO DO LIBBY?
WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THIS
A LOT, THE REPERCUSSIONS COULD
BE DOWN THE LINE.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LAST
MINUTE CALL.
YEAH.
HERE IS MY DILEMMA 678 I HAVE
THE CHOICE OF TAKING OUT LIBBY
OR BRADLEY.
THE REASON WHY LIBBY MAY BE A
BETTER CHOICE NOW IS BECAUSE
SHE'S VERY CHARMING AND I FELL
FOR THAT ONCE BEFORE WITH LIBBY
WHERE I GAVE HER A LITTLE BIT OF
ROPE AND SHE HUNG ME WITH IT.
WHEN MY GIRL MORGAN WAS VOTED
OUT.
IT IS GETTING CLOSE.
YEAH, IT IS.
SO I CERTAINLY DON'T TRUST
LIBBY BUT MOVING FORWARD INTO
THE MERGE, BRAD LEE'S ATTITUDE
AND HIS SHORT TEMPER COULD BE
DISASTROUS FOR ME.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AT
THIS POINT.
I HAVE TO DETERMINE IF TAKING
THIS RISK BEFORE THE MERGE IS
GOING TO PAY OFF IN THE END.
SO DOMINIC WE'VE HAD THIS
ONGOING STORY OF ORIGINAL NAVITI
VERSUS ORIGINAL MALOLO, IS THAT
STILL A FACTOR?
I BELIEVE IT IS TO AN EXTENT.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
INTERMINGLING.
SO THERE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN NEW
RELATIONSHIPS BUILT WITHIN THAT.
BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI MAY WORK
TOGETHER FROM THIS POINT
FORWARD.
DONATHAN, CONCERN YOU THAT
YOU AND LIBBEY AS ORIGINAL
MALOLO MIGHT JUST SIMPLY NOT
HAVE THE NUMBERS TO DO ANYTHING?
IT IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN
WHETHER OR NOT THESE GUYS CAN
TAKE US AND AIM FOR ME OR LIBBY.
WHAT IS THE VAIB AT CAMP WITH
THAT UNDERLYING TENSION, HEY, WE
HAVE THE NUMBERS T IS ONE OF YOU
TWO TONTD.
YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T KNOW
THAT THERE WAS ANY KIND OF A
VIBE, OR ANY TENSION.
THE FIVE OF US GET ALONG
SWIMMINGLY T IS ALMOST SHOCKING
FROM A SURVIVOR FAN STANDPOINT.
WE'VE ALL JUST BEEN A COHEESIVE
BUNCH.
DONATHAN, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
THIS IS ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY?
WELL, I WOON SAY SO MUCH BIG
HAPPY FAMILY, YOU KNOW THERE ARE
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE
PAST, WE BLIND SIDED POR BEGAN
AND I'M SURE DONE NICK MAY STILL
BE BURNED ABOUT THAT.
DONATHAN BRAININGS UP A GOOD
POINT.
I WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN BY
SURPRISE, TO THIS DAY IT STILL
STINGS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE
MORGAN WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF
MINE.
LIBBEY, WHEN YOU HEAR
DOMENICK SAY IT STILL STINGS, IS
YOUR FEAR THAT HE DOESN'T TRUST
ME?
YEAH, IT'S TOUGH TO HEAR THAT
IT DOES STILL STING.
I HOPE THAT I CAN STILL WORK
WITH HIM IN THE FUTURE AND TO
KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THAT.
BUT I WAS TRUST WORTHY TO MY
ALLIANCE.
MORGAN AND I HAD A BOND.
BUT MY ALLIANCE WAS STRONGER
THAN THAT BOND.
AND SO I HAD TO STAY LOYAL TO
THAT.
THAT LOYALTY, CAN I EASILY BRING
TO ANOTHER ALLIANCE AND SO I
HAVE TO STAND BY MY DECISION AND
IT FELT RIGHT.
AND IT STILL FEELS RIGHT.
AND THAT IS PART OF THE GAME.
BRADLEY, DO YOU RESPECT THAT
STH SHE'S NOT BACKING DOWN OFF
HER VOTE.
I RESPECT THAT A LOT BUT I
COULD GIVE HER SOME KOWNTD
POINTS AS TO MAYBE WHY POR BEGAN
WASN'T THE RIGHT PICK BUT I DISS
DON'T THEY THE DYNAMIC OF WHAT
HABBED AT THAT TRIBAL VERY MUCH.
WHICH IS INTERESTING THAT YOU
WOULD OFFER COUNTERPOINTS TO
SOMETHING YOU ADMIT YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.
I MEAN I WILL ARGUE ABOUT THE
COLOR OF THE SKY IF I HAVE TO.
IT'S JUST YOUR NATURE, YOU
MEAN?
YEAH, I THINK IT COMES FROM A
DEEP ROOT OF, I LOVE
CONVERSATION, THAT IS THE
EASIEST WAY TO HAVE A BACK AND
FORTH, SOMETIMES IT CAN BE
POSITIVEK STIMES IT CAN
DEFINITELY BE NEGATIVE.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THE DICK
THAT JUST KEEPS PLAYING DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE CONSTANTLY BECAUSE I
HATE THAT PERSON AS MUCH AS THE
NEXT PERSON, SO-- .
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, I
DON'T THINK WE'RE ARGUING A
WHOLE LOT AROUND CAMP, AT LEAST
I DON'T THINK I'M BEING
ARGUMENTATIVE.
IF WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION,
I LIKE TO BRING UP ALL THE
POINTS.
IT PROVIDES A DIALOGUE.
I THINK ALSO, JEFF, IT IS
TOUGH TO DISAGREE ON THINGS BUT
AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE THE PERSON THAT BEGINS
CONFLICT.
SO A LOT OF THE TIME YOU HAVE TO
BITE YOUR TONGUE AND JUST SIT
BACK AND LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE
ARE SAYING EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE
WITH THEM.
IT'S HARD.
YOU WANT PEOPLE WITH A LEVEL
HEAD THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET
THROUGH TO, AND YOU CAN HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH THEM AND HAVE
A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH WITH
THAT PERSON AS WELL.
DHEL SEE, IS THAT A FEAR
THAT-- CHELSEA IS THAT A FEAR
THAT BEHAVIOR IN CAMP COULD
CAUSE PROBLEMS?
I THINK YOUR BEHAVIOR ALWAYS
AFFECTS YOU IN THIS GAME, YOU
KNOW, IF YOU RUB PEM THE WRONG
WAY, YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THAT
WILL AFFECT YOU DOWN THE LINE.
SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KIND OF BE
AWARE OF YOUR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS
OTHER PEOPLE.
SO LIBBY, AS WE GET READY TO
VOTE, WHAT IS THE CASE, WHY
SHOULDN'T NAVITI JUST STICK
TOGETHER?
WELL, I MEAN WE ARE GETTING
CLOSER TO THE MERGE.
IT'S TIME THAT WE START THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE.
AND I WANT TO HELP WITH THAT
FUTURE.
DOMENICK, WHAT IS THE
CRITERIA TONIGHT FOR YOU?
ITS A HE-- IT'S A LOT IT TAKE
INTO CONVERSATION T IS A TRUST
FACTOR IT IS A COMPATIBILITY
FACTOR.
AND IT IS ALSO WHAT EVERY
RELATIONSHIP THAT PERSON MAY
HAVE BUILT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND
HOW THAT COULD BENEFIT YOU LATER
IN THE GAME.
ALL RIGHT, TIME TO VOTE.
BRADLEY, YOU ARE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES. IF
ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ
THE DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I WILL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, LIBBY.
BRADLEY, ONE VOTE LIBBY, ONE
VOTE BRAD LEE.
-- BRADLEY.
BRADLEY.
TWO VOTES BRADLEY, ONE VOTE
LIBBY.
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT,
BRADLEY.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT IS THREE THRARKS IS
ENOUGH, YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.
GOOD LUCK IN THE REST OF THE
GAME.
BRADLEY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
THANKS.
ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME.
OH MY GOD.
WOW.
DAMN.
THAT'S CRAZY.
WELL, BASED ON TONIGHT,
TRIBAL LINES ARE WEAKENING.
PERSONAL BONDS ARE GROWING.
AND WITH ONLY FOUR PEOPLE, COULD
BE VERY INTERESTING.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.
THREE TRIBES COME TOGETHER.
THE MERGE!
IT IS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING
FOR ME.
BUT A WAR WAGES ON.
DOM'S ALWAYS BEEN AFTER ME BUT
I'M TOO SUAVE.
THESE TWO GUYS CAN BLOW UP
THE WORLD IF THEY WANT.
FINALLY LINES ARE DRAWN IN
THE SAND.
I WAS BLIND SIDED 100%.
BUT AS A SUPERFAN OF SURVIVOR,
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY I WOULD
RATHER GO OUT.
I'M A VERY CONFIDENT PERSON.
I'M SURE OF MYSELF AND I THINK
THAT COMES ACROSS AS A LITTLE
OVERBEARING TO PEOPLE AT TIMES.
I COULD HAVE DONE A WHOLE LOT
BETTER.
I FEEL LIKE IF I MADE IT INTO
THE MERGE, I WOULD HAVE WON THE
GAME.
SO HATS OFF TO THEM.
