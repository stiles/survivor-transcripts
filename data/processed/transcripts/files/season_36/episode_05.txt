 --- 

        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE NAVITI TRIBE,
THERE WAS A WARÃ‘i BETWEEN CHRIS
AND DOMENICK.
THOSE TWO ARE DEFINITELY LIKE
BUTTING HEADS.
Jeff: AND THE ORIGINAL
NAVITI WERE TURNING ON EACH
OTHER.
MY OWN FAMILY SLIT MY THROAT.
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE TRYING TO
TAKE ME OUT IF THEY'RE TRYING TO
TAKE YOU OUT.
RIGHT.
THE MALOLO TRIBE WAS FACING
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND THE ORIGINAL NAVITI WERE A
UNITED FRONT AGAINST JENNA,








MICHAEL, AND STEPHANIE.
FORTUNATELY FOR US WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS, WE'RE IN CONTROL,
AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL THE
SHOTS.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE NAVITI ALLIANCE STAYED
STRONG.
STEPHANIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING MICHAEL AND JENNA
FIGHTING TO STAY ALIVE.
15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
COME ON IN, GUYS!
NAVITI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW MALOLO TRIBE.
STEPHANIE VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO NAVITI HAS BEEN ON A WINNING
STREAK.








MALOLO ON A LOSING STREAK.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOW.
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.
TOSS 'EM OUT.
OH, MAN.
Jeff: MICHAEL, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW?
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ON A LOSING
STREAK, AND THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR
ANYBODY, REGARDLESS YOUR YOUR
ALLIANCE.
FROM A GAME POINT OF VIEW,
IT'S MY SAVING GRACE.
US MALOLO WERE DOWN ON THE
NUMBERS FROM THE ORIGINAL TRIBE
SWAP.
NOW THAT THINGS ARE GETTING
SHAKEN UP AGAIN, IT LOOKS LIKE
MAYBE A BRIGHT LIGHT AT THE END
OF A TUNNEL FOR ME AND JENNA.
Jeff: JAMES, WHAT'S
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, FROM A GAME
POINT OF VIEW?
I THINK WE'VE ALL SURVIVED
THIS SO-CALLED FIRST PHASE OF
THE GAME.
FROM NOW ON IT'S A RACE TO THE
MERGE AND BEYOND, AND WHAT
HAPPENS TODAY COULD BE REALLY
CRITICAL IN EVERYONE'S GAME
PLAY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
YES.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
Jeff: NEW BUFFS.
DON'T OPEN.
WAIT FOR ME.
WHY, JEFF?
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS?
DEPENDING ON THE BUFF I PICK UP,
I COULD BE IN TROUBLE.
SO I'M JUST PRAYING THAT FATE
DOES ITS PART AND HAS MY BACK.
YOU KNOW, FATE A HOMIE.
THAT'S WHAT I'M BRINGING.
THAT'S LEFT FOR YOU,
DOMENICK.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL YOUR BUFFS, SEE
WHAT TRIBE YOU'RE ON.
PLEASE.
MA'AM MALL.
NAVITI.
Jeff: AND YOU WILL SOON
DISCOVER THERE'S A THIRD COLOR.
GREEN.
Jeff: WE'RE SWITCHING FROM
TWO TRIBES TO THREE TRIBES.
WHOA.
Jeff: IF YOU HAVE PURPLE,
HEAD TO PURPLE.
IF YOU HAVE ORANGE, GO TO
ORANGE, AND IF YOU'RE GREEN, GO
IN THE MIDDLE.
YOU HAVE PURPLE?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE
LODGE.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THAT SON OF A BITCH CHRIS WAS
AFTER ME, SO GETTING AWAY FROM
HIM WAS A RELIEF.
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE BALL IS
IN MY COURT.
I CAN DECIDE WHICH WAY THIS GAME
GOES.
Jeff: WOW, THIS IS A
FLIP-FLOP.
THERE ARE THREE ORIGINAL NAVITI
AND TWO ORIGINAL MALOLO ON ALL
THREE TRIBES.
BRADLEY, AT THIS POINT IT'S
REALLY TOUGH TO RELY ON PURPLE
OR ORANGE, BECAUSE NOW THERE'S
BEEN ENOUGH INTERCONNECTING
BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T
KNOW WHERE ANYBODY REALLY
STANDS.
YEAH, I MEAN, I STILL THINK
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
DO THE ORIGINAL DIVISIONS STAND,
OR ARE THERE NEW THINGS
HAPPENING?
I DON'T KNOW.
I LOOK FORWARD THE FINDING OUT
ABOUT IT AND SEEING WHERE
EVERYBODY STANDS.
Jeff: DONATHAN, IS THIS
GOOD FOR YOU, BAD FOR YOU, OR IS
IT NEUTRAL AT THIS POINT?
HELL, I DON'T KNOW, JEFF.
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER MET THESE
PEOPLE BEFORE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT.
WE GOT THREE NAVITI 2.0s HERE
AND TWO ORIGINAL MALOLOS.
ARE THESE GUYS GOING TO STAY OR
ME AND LIBBY KIND OF, I JUST
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, MAN.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT COMES WITH A IEW
TRIBE, NEW BEACH, NEW SHELTER.
YEAH, MAN, YOU HAVE TO START
OVER, START FROM SCRATCH.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME
STRENGTH ON OUR HANDS.
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A
PROBLEM, JEFF.
HERE'S THE FACT, IN
"SURVIVOR," TURNING POINTS ARE
WHERE THE STRONG PLAYERS SHINE
AND THE WEAK PLAYERS FADE.
AND REGARDLESS HOW YOU'RE
FEELING RIGHT NOW, YOUR ODDS OF
GETTING TO THE END WITH ONLY 15
PEOPLE LEFT ARE BETTER NOW THAN
THEY WERE WHEN THE GAME STARTED.
SO HANG ON TO THAT.
BRAND-NEW START TO "SURVIVOR:
GHOST ISLAND."
TRIBE NAME, A MAP TO YOUR NEW
HOME.
HEAD OUT DOWN THE BEACH.
GOOD LUCK STARTING YOUR NEW
SHELTER.
NAVITI, MALOLO, GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
THE SWAP ISN'T THE BEST THAT
I'D HOPED FOR, BUT EVEN THOUGH I
AM STILL DOWN IN NUMBERS, THIS
MIGHT BE THE START OF SOMETHING
NEW FOR ME.
I NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OF THIS
OPPORTUNITY, AND THAT'S WHAT I
INTEND TO DO.
HELL, YEAH, GUYS.
HOME SWEET HOME.
FISHING GEAR.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING THE
LOSE.
WE GOT SKILLS IN EVERY CATEGORY.
EVERY CATEGORY.
I WANT THE TALK TO YOU.
I HAVE A NEW APARTMENT.
WE GOT YOU COVERED.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK
KNOWING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
START FROM SCRATCH, BUT I'VE
BEEN ON A LOSING TRIBE, SO I
WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO WIN REWARD, HAVE SOME FOOD,
NOT HAVE TO GO BACK THE TRIBAL
EVERY NIGHT.
I THINK THE FRESH START IS
PERFECT TIMING AND I'M EXCITED
ABOUT IT.
C BASS, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR
YOU.
SHUT UP, YOU SAVED IT, DUDE?
I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO COME
BACK TOGETHER, MAN.
IT SMELLS HORRENDOUS.
THAT'S THE PERFECT SHELL.
I FOUND IT WHEN IT WAS ALIVE.
I'M BIG INTO COLLECTING
LITTLE REMINDERS.
THAT'S WHY I WEAR MY NECKLACES
EVERY DAY.
I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS GORGEOUS
CONCH SHELL I FOUND AT OLD
NAVITI.
WENDELL HAD THE HEART TO DRAG
THAT OUT HERE IN HIS BACK
REEKING OF DEAD CONCH.
WENDELL, I LOVE YOU, MAN.
I HAVEN'T SPENT MUCH TIME WITH
WENDELL BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS
BUDDY BUDDY WITH DOMENICK.
HE'S BEEN THAT BUDDY THAT WASN'T
MY BUDDY, AND HE KNOWS WHO I AM,
AND I'VE BARELY MET HIM.
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
I'M HAPPY TO GO TO THE MERGE.
I'M HAPPY WE'RE OFF THAT ISLAND.
YOU WERE NEXT TO THE WRONG
PERSON AT THE WRONG TIME.
THIS I KNOW.
IT'S A NEW DAY, BRO.
I WAS SO READY TO DROP MY
BUFF, BECAUSE I FELT MYSELF
TRYING SOMEHOW TO MANAGE TWO
GIANT EGOS, DOMENICK AND CHRIS,
WHO BOTH WANT TO KILL EACH
OTHER, AND I'M A LITTLE SAD I'M
NOT GOING TO BE WITH MY BOY DOM,
BUT I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THAT
CHRIS ANDRY ON ANOTHER TEAM
TOGETHER.
HE'S A BEAST OF AN ATLEAD WITH
AN EXTREMELY WINNING TRACK
RECORD OUT HERE.
NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO ME HAVING
TO HEAR CHRIS BRAG AND BOAST AND
ALL THESE THINGS, I DON'T LOVE
THAT AT ALL.
SO LAURA, YOU'RE A VOLLEYBALL
PLAYER?
YEAH.
I PLAYED SOME BEACH
VOLLEYBALL.
I PLAYED SOME BEACH VOLLEYBALL
IN COCOA A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
I PLAYED AND WON IN CHICAGO AND
OUR TEAM WON THE TOURNEY.
WHEN YOU'RE A BIG ATHLETIC GUY
AND CHARISMATIC LIKE I AM, I
WON'T LIE TO YOU.
IT'S EXHAUSTING.
SOME PEOPLE CAN JUST SIT AROUND
AND JUST CHILL AND LET THE GAME
EVOLVE, WHERE I'M SITTING HERE
HAVING TO THINK AHEAD AND
DEVELOP THIS BOND AND THAT BOND,
BECAUSE I HAVE AN X ON MY BACK
FROM DAY ONE.
I LOOK AT MYSELF AS MY OWN
ENTREPRENEUR, I HAVEN'T THOUGH
I'M NOT INVESTING IN A MILLION
THINGS RIGHT NOW, I SEE MYSELF
INVESTING IN ME.
I CAN SEE YOU AS A
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER.
IT'S TOUGH BITING MY TONGUE
AROUND CHRIS.
HE'S A GUY THAT LIKES TO HEAR
HIMSELF TALK, BUT I'VE BEEN PUT
IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
SITUATION, AND I FOUND A WAY TO
FIT IN AND GET ALONG IN EVERY
ONE.
AND I THINK THAT'S A SKILL THAT
I HAVE IS FITTING IN WITH THE
PEOPLE THAT I'M AROUND AND KIND
OF BEING WHAT THEY NEED ME TO
BE.
I ACTUALLY DO MODEL.
OH, YOU MODEL?
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY.
ACTUALLY, I TOLL LIBBY THAT I
USED TO MODEL.
BUT YOU STILL DO?
YEAH.
I'M HESITANT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT
I MODEL BECAUSE FOR SOME CRAZY
REASON PEOPLE THINK THAT MODELS
MIGHT BE SELF-ABSORBED, THEY
MIGHT BE DUMB, JUST A LOT OF
THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT BE
BENEFICIAL TO ME IN A TRIBE
SETTING.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T TELL PEOPLE,
BUT I'M SIGNED IN MIAMI AND
CHICAGO AND NEW YORK.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
I I THINK HE THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO BLOW MY MIND THAT HE'S
A MODEL.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
JOCK, MODEL, PERSONAL TRAINER,
WHATEVER HE, IS IT'S NICE TO
HAVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S A
COMPETITOR.
HE WANTS TO WIN SO BADLY, HE'S
GOOD TO HAVE AROUND, BUT THE
TRIBE IS STARTING TO GET RUBBED
THE WRONG WAY ABOUT CHRIS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
CHRIS.
IT'S HARD FOR ME THE BITE MY
TONGUE.
IT GETS OLD.
YEAH.
I THINK FOR US IT'S FINE TO
LET HIM DO HIS THING, LET HIM
DIG HIS OWN GRAVE, AS LONG AS WE
KEEP WINNING, I THINK WE'RE
HAPPY TO JUST SMILE AND NOD AND
GO ALONG WITH IT.
BUT IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO
LOSE, I THINK THAT CHRIS IS IN
FOR A WORLD OF TROUBLE.
OH, DUDE.
WELL, I'M HAPPY WITH THIS
FIVE.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL.
WE HAVE A MIX OF ALL
DIFFERENT SKILL SETS I THINK.
YEAH.
SO WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SHOT AT
DOING THIS.
RIGHT TO THE MERGE, BABY.
RIGHT TO THE MERGE.
TO HAVE TO SWITCH UP THE
TRIBES AGAIN, IT'S CRAZY.
BUT IT'S ALL GOOD.
I HAVE MY FORMER TRIBE, NAVITI.
WE'RE FIVE STRONG AND WE WERE
STICKING TO IT, VOTING OUT
MALOLO ONE BY ONE.
AND NOW ME, ANG AND KELLYN STILL
HAVE THE NUMBERS, 3-2.
THE ONLY QUESTION MARK IS
ANGELA.
SHE'S BEEN ON THE SAME TRIBE
WITH JAMES FOR A WHILE NOW, SO I
DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S THINKING.
SO THERE WAS NOT LIKE A TRIBE
BATTLE.
THERE WAS MORE INTERNAL CHRIS
AND DOM BATTLE.
BASICALLY, WENDELL AND
DOMENICK CAME TO US AND SAID, WE
NEED TO GET ANGELA OUT, SHE'S
CHRIS'S RIGHT-HAND PERSON, SHE'S
DANGEROUS.
SO DOMENICK, MORGAN, AND WENDELL
VOTED FOR ANGELA, AND THAT GAVE
MALOLO THE NUMBERS TO VOTE OUT
MORGAN.
TURNS OUT DOM AND CHRIS
COULDN'T TAKE A DEEP BETH, GET A
LONG FOR A FEW VOTES AND KEEP
AND A
NAVITI STRONG.
INSTEAD THEY TRIED TO VOTE OUT
ANGELA, AND I STARTED TO GET
THIS FEELING IN MY STOMACH, LIKE
THIS COULD BE TROUBLE.
SO THEN WE GET BACK TO CAMP.
I'M TWO SHADES OF PISSED OFF.
WHEN I SAW IT WAS JUST ME AND
JAMES VERSUS THREE NAVITI, I WAS
WORRIED, THAT YOU KNOW, I WOULD
BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO, BUT NOW I
FIND OUT ANGELA GOT STABBED IN
THE BACK BY HER OWN TRIBE AND
SHE'S PISSED OFF.
BASICALLY I'M HERE BECAUSE OF
MALOLO, NOT BECAUSE OF MY OWN
FAMILY, IT WAS BECAUSE YOU GUYS
SAVED ME.
BUT IT'S A NEW DAY.
IT'S A NEW DAY.
A NEW DAY, A NEW TRIBE.
THIS IS HUGE.
THERE ARE DEFINITELY CRACKS IN
THE NAVITI GROUP, AND ANGELA HAS
ALREADY BEEN SCREWED ONCE BY
THEM, SO SHE'S MAYBE SOMEBODY
THAT JAMES AND I CAN WORK WITH.
WELL, BUDDY, IT IS GOOD TO
SEE YOU.
DUDE, I'VE BEEN ON THE HOT
SEAT NON-STOP.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HELL TRIBAL.
WHAT'S YOUR READ ON KELLYN AND
DES?
THEY ARE UNBREAKABLE.
I PROMISE YOU.
DUDE, WOW WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW
TRULY TIGHT THE FIVE WAS.
LIKE WE WERE PITCHING A HARD
CASE AND THEY DID NOT EVEN
WAIVER.
THIS WAS BAD SWAP FOR ME.
NOT ONLY AM I BACK ON THE
BOTTOM, BUT ALSO I'M NOT THAT
CLOSE WITH MICHAEL.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE DID
WRITE MY NAME DOWN IN THE SECOND
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
HOWEVER, I THINK, YOU KNOW, LIKE
WE'RE STILL ON THE SAME PAGE,
BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY TWO
MALOLO.
SO WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.
I THINK HE KNOWS THAT.
WHAT'S YOUR READ ON ANGELA?
IS SHE TIGHT WITH THEM?
SO, THE THING, IS US OLD
MALOLO FOUR LITERALLY SAVED HER,
AND SO HOPEFULLY LIKE SHE DOES
FEEL ENDEBTED TO US.
BUT WE'LL HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT
FOR US FOR SURE.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME HOME, GUYS.
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE THE
SQUALOR.
COMING BACK TO THE NAVITI
BEACH IS LIKE GOING TO A RESORT
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SLUM.
WE HAVE COCONUT, RICE LEFT,
COFFEE.
THERE'S PILLOW, THERE'S
BLANKETS.
THERE'S COUGH FEATURE.
IT FELT LIKE WE WON A REWARD.
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER RIGHT
NOW.
FROM A STRATEGIC GAME
STANDPOINT, DOM IS A GOOD ALLY.
CHELSEA HAS BEEN VOTING WITH ME.
SO OLD NAVITI HAS THE ADVANTAGE,
THREE OF US, TWO OF THEM, BUT
THERE IS A LOT OF UNKNOWN COMING
TO THIS BEACH.
NEVER KNEW A CUP OF COFFEE
COULD MEAN SO MUCH.
DO YOU HAVE TEARS?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE TEARS?
IT'S LIKE HOME.
Jeff: IT TASTES LIKE HOME.
OH, CHELSEA.
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AT THE
MALOLO CAMP, WE HAD NOT BEEN
EATING HARDLY AT ALL.
WE HAD LOST FOUR CHALLENGES IN A
ROW.
I WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED.
COMING BACK HERE, HAVING SUCH AN
AMAZING CAMP AND HAVING THAT CUP
OF COFFEE GAVE ME A SENSE OF
HOME AND IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I
HAD THE ENERGY TO KEEP FIGHTING
OUT HERE.
YOU SEE AN OCCASIONAL SMILE
FROM ME, JUST KNOW THAT I'M
HAVING A MOMENT OF RELIEF TODAY
TO NOT HAVE CHRIS ON MY TAIL.
SOMEHOW IT'S JUST NICE.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE FOR THE FIRST
TIME I CAN JUST LET MY HAIR
DOWN.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS GAME
I HAVE THIS WEIGHT OFF MY
SHOULDERS OF HAVING CHRIS
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK AND
TELLING EVERYONE, GET RID OF
DOM, GET RID OF DOM.
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE PIECE OF
CRAP I MADE.
IT'S A SHELL ON A STRING.
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY HE
STILL BELIEVES IT'S REAL.
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT ON DEFENSE
ANYMORE.
AND I'M ACTUALLY IN A SPOT WHERE
I HAVE CONTROL AT THE MOMENT,
BECAUSE THERE'S THREE ORIGINAL
NAVITI, AND I FEEL SAFE WITH
DONATHAN.
WE'RE TOGETHER.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY COULD
PLAY ME JUST LIKE I WAS PLAYED
THE FIRST TIME.
SO NO MORE TRAINING WHEELS OUT
HERE.
IT'S TIME TO GET DIRTY.
LIBBY IS A DEVIL IN AN ANGEL'S
BODY.
LIBBY IS OUT FOR BLOOD.
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE'S DEALING
WITH?
I KNOW EXACTLY THE GAME SHE'S
PLAYING.
I'LL COME SIT BY YOU.
EVERY TIME I TRY TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH HER, SHE
DOESN'T GIVE ME ANYTHING SOLID.
SHE'S GOT TO GO ALMOST AS BAD AS
CHRIS HAS TO GO.
SO HOW ARE YOU AND DONATHAN
WITH LIBBY?
LIBBY WILL CUT YOUR THROAT IN
A MINUTE.
LIBBY HAS A SEDUCTIVE POWER.
SHE'S GOT THE SOUTHERN BELLE
CHARM.
SHE'S PAVARTI2.0.
DOM WARNED ME, DON'T TRUST
LIBBY, SHE'S REALLY DANGEROUS.
I THINK IF WE GO TO STRIEBL
COUNCIL, LIBBY IS THE
STRATEGICALLY BETTER OPTION TO
GET RID OF.
AS LONG AS WE'RE TIGHT, WE'LL
GET CHELSEA.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
A THING.
YOU'RE MY CLOSEST ALLY OUT
HERE.
IT'S FANTASTIC RECONNECTING WITH
DOM.
WE'RE BACK ON THE SAME PAGE, AND
IT FEELS GREAT.
IN TERMS OF THIS GAME, MAYBE I'M
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT I WAS.
I THOUGHT I WAS FANTASTIC, BUT
MAYBE I AM AS FANTASTIC AS I
THINK BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M
PLAYING AN A-PLUS GAME.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AS NEW
TRIBES?
YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
LIBBY.
I'LL TAKE BACK THE IDOL.
THANK YOU.
THIS IDOL IS NO MOORE BECAUSE
NOW TWO TRIBES ARE FIGHTING FOR
IMMUNITY.
TWO TRIBES WILL BE SAFE FROM THE
VOTE.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
YEAH.
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, ONE PERSON WILL BE
YOUR CALLER.
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL BE
BLINDFOLDED.
USING ONLY VERBAL COMMANDS, THE
CALLER WILL LEAD THE BLINDFOLDED
PAIRS TO RETRIEVE THREE BAGS OF
PUZZLE PIECES.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS,
THE CALLER WILL THEN LEAD ONE
PAIR OF BLINDFOLDED TRIBE
MEMBERS TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO GET
THEIR PUZZLE FINISHED WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
GHOST ISLAND."
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HOAR WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
STAY TOGETHER.
GUYS, STAY TOGETHER.
DON'T GO DIAGONAL.
GO STRAIGHT.
WE HAVE DESIREE CALLING FOR
MALOLO.
MOVE FASTER.
Jeff: WENDELL CALLING FOR
YANUA.
AND DOMENICK CALLING FOR NAVITI.
STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT,
STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT.
Jeff: WHO WILL COMMUNICATE
THE BEST WITH THEIR TWO PAIRS?
THAT IS WHAT THIS CHALLENGE IS
ALL ABOUT.
LAUREL, LAUREL, STRAIGHT UP.
REACH UP, REACH UP.
Jeff: LAUREL WORKING ON
THAT FIRST BAG.
CAN YOU FEEL IT?
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
Jeff: KELLYN WORKING ON HER
FIRST BAG.
LET'S GO.
CHELSEA, TURN RIGHT, TURN
RIGHT.
STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT.
RIGHT THERE.
GET UNDER.
CHELSEA, GO UNDER.
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.
MICHAEL AND JAMES.
Jeff: MICHAEL WORKING ON A
BAG FOR MALOLO.
KELLYN RELEASES THAT FIRST BAG.
COME TO MY VOICE.
UNHOOK IT.
DONATHAN AND CHELSEA WORKING ON
A BAG FOR NAVITI.
THAT'S OUR BAG.
THAT IS OUR BAG.
DONATHAN, NO.
WHY IS HE HOLLERING.
THAT IS OUR BAG.
COME ON.
Jeff: THERE IS NOW A FIGHT
OVER THE BAGS.
CHELSEA HAS HER HANDS ON IT.
MICHAEL HAS HIS HANDS ON IT.
WE HAVE TWO PAIRS FROM OPPOSITE
TRIBES FIGHTING OVER THE SAME
BAG.
SOMEBODY IS RIGHT, SOMEBODY IS
WRONG.
CHELSEA, LET GO.
THAT'S OUR BAG, THAT'S OUR
BAG.
Jeff: CHELSEA AND DONATHAN
LET THAT BAG GO.
CHELSEA, TURN AROUND, GO BACK
UNDER, MAKE A RIGHT.
COME HERE TO, MY VOICE.
Jeff: ANGELA AND KELLYN

WENDELL, WHERE ARE YOU?
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT
HERE.
NOW GO BACK TO YOUR RIGHT.
SHIFT LEFT, TO YOUR LEFT!
Jeff: NAVITI STILL EMPTY
WITH NO BAGS.
IT IS MALOLO WITH TWO BAGS.
GO STRAIGHT, MICHAEL.
YANUA WITH ONE BAG.

Jeff: AND NAVITI WITH
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AS CHELSEA
AND DONATHAN NOW HAVE A BAG FOR
NAVITI.

RIGHT THERE.
GET UNDER.
Jeff: LIBBY AND BRADLEY
HAVE THEIR SECOND BAG FOR
NAVITI.
COME ON, BRADLEY.
CHRIS, FIVE STEPS BACK.
LAUREL, LAUREL, TO THE RIGHT.
HARD RIGHT, LAUREL.
HOLD ON.
I'M LOST.
WENDELL?
Jeff: SEBASTIAN AND CHRIS

STUCK OUT IN THE MIDDLE
NOVEMBERWHERE SEARCHING.
CHRIS, BEHIND YOU.
RIGHT THERE.
GO TO YOUR LEFT!
AT YOUR FEET.
AT YOUR FEET.
RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE.
GRAB IT.
Jeff: MIKELE WITH A BIG
FALL.
HE STARTS DIGGING FOR MALOLO.
BRADLEY, FOLLOW MY VOICE,
BABE.
WATCH OUT FOR THE POLE.
Jeff: LIBBY TAKES A BIG
HIT.
YOU OKAY, LIBBY?
Jeff: ON THE CHIN.
YOU GOT IT?
Jeff: SEBASTIAN AND CHRIS

GO TO YOUR LEFT.
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT.

FIRST TIME IN THE CHALLENGE IN A
LONG TIME.

DESIREE NOW GOING TO LEAD THEM
BACK TO THE PUDDLE TABLE.
STILL BLINDFOLDED.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU FALL
INTO ANYTHING.
Jeff: DONATHAN AND CHELSEA
WORKING TOGETHER FOR THAT THIRD
BAG FOR NAVITI.
YOU GOT IT.
THERE YOU GO.
GO!
Jeff: DESIREE BARKING OUT
ORDERS TO HER FOUR.
FOLLOW MY VOICE.
Jeff: YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
STILL BLINDFOLDED, BUT THEY'RE
IN THE LEAD AND THEY CAN FEEL
THE MOMENTUM.
LET'S GO.
Jeff: HUGE LEAD RIGHT NOW
FOR MALOLO.
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO!
OKAY.
Jeff: DESIREE AND MALOLO
ARE AT THE PUZZLE TABLE.
NOW DESIREE HAS TO GUIDE TWO
BLIND FOLDED TRIBE MEMBERS TO
SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
DONATHAN AND CHELSEA WORKING
TOGETHER NOW FOR THEIR THIRD AND
FINAL BAG FOR NAVITI.
THAT IS TEAMWORK RIGHT THERE.
DONATHAN IS SPINNING CHELSEA.
DROP IT.
LET GO.
WHERE ARE YOU?
Jeff: YANUA HAS ALL THREE
BAGS.
WENDELL DROPS DOWN.
HERE COMES DONATHAN AND CHELSEA
WITH THEIR THIRD BAG.
LET'S GO.
Jeff: OH, CHELSEA BANGS
INTO THE POST.
IT'S NOW A RACE TO GET TO THE
PUDDLE TABLE.
MALOLO WITH A BIG LEAD.
THEY'VE ALREADY STARRED WORK ON
THEIR PUZZLE.
HERE COMES ANNABELLA SCIORRA LED
BY WENDELL.
HERE COMES NAVITI LED BY
DOMENICK.
DOMENICK, SLOW DOWN.
THIS IS ABOUT TEAMWORK.
YOU NEED TO MAKE UP TIME
QUICKLY.
TWO TRIBES NOW MAKING IT THROUGH
THE CENTER TUNNEL NOW.
ALL TRYING TO GET TO THEIR
PUZZLE TABLE WHERE MALOLO IS
ALREADY HARD AT WORK.
MALOLO WOULD LOVE TO GET A WIN.
IT IS KELLYN AND ANGELA WORKING
ON THE PUZZLE WITH DESIREE MAKE
THE CALL.
FEED IT INTO THE TRIANGLE.
Jeff: WENDELL GETS TO THE
PUZZLE TABLE FOR YANUA.
DOMENICK RIGHT BEHIND.
WHERE'S THE BAG?
Jeff: WHERE ARE THEIR BAGS?
WENDELL IS THE LEADER.
HE LEFT WITHOUT ALL THREE BAGS.
MASSIVE SETBACK THAT HAS COST
YANUA.
SLIDE IT IN THE TRIANGLE.
YOU FEEL THE HOLE.
Jeff: DESIREE YELLING AT
HER TRIBE.
MALOLO HAS MADE NO PROGRESS
DESPITE A HUGE LEAD.
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
THE PUZZLE IS A CIRCLE.
DOMENICK IS IN THE IMPORTANT
SPOT, HERO OR GOAT RIGHT NOW.
I'M BACK.
I'M BAG.
Jeff: WENDELL NOW FEELING
THE PRESSURE THE MAKE UP WHAT HE
JUST COST HIS TRIBE.
C BASS, START PUTTING THOSE
PIECES.
I NEED A WHITE.
Jeff: I'M LOOKING, BABE.
Jeff: IF YOU CANNOT GUIDE
YOUR BLIND FOLDED TRIBE MEMBERS,
YOU WILL BE GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
SWING IT LEFT.
KEEP GOING LEFT, KEEP GOING
LEFT.
Jeff: WENDELL CAUSED HIS
TRIBE A VERY BIG SETBACK IS
QUICKLY MAKING UP TIME.
SLIDE IT IN THE CIRCLE.
YOU NEED THE FEEL THE TABLE.
Jeff: DESIREE, WHO COULD
NOT GET THE PUZZLE DAY ON DAY
ONE NOW IN CHARGE OF THE PUZZLE
ON DAY 17.
NO, THE CIRCLE PIECE.
YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND,
KELLYN.
THAT GOES IN THAT TRIANGLE.
NOW GET THAT ROUND PIECE YOU
JUST HAD AND PUT IT IN.
Jeff: YANUA WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.
LOOK THAT, YANUA IS BACK IN
THIS.
THEY'RE IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW.
NAVITI FIGHTING AGAINST MALOLO
NOW.
WE GOT OUR OUTSIDE CIRCLE
DONE.
THE NEXT PIECE, FLIP THAT
OVER.
Jeff: MALOLO NOW STARTING
TO GET SOME MOMENTUM.
YES!
I NEED YOU THE SLIDE IT UP.
Jeff: THIS CHALLENGE HAS
COME DOWN TO COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE CALLER AND THE
PUZZLE SOLVER.
UPSIDE DOWN.
UPSIDE DOWN.
Jeff: THIS WOULD BE A HUGE
COMEBACK FOR THE NEW TRIBE YANUA
WHO WAS DEAD LAST GETTING TO THE
PUZZLE TABLE, AND THEY'RE NOW IN
THE LEAD AND VERY CLOSE TO
WINNING THIS CHALLENGE.
THERE IT IS!
YANUA THINKS THEY HAVE IT, AND
THEY DO.
YANUA WINS IMMUNITY!
IT IS NOW MALOLO AND NAVITI JUST
LIKE OLD TIMES BATTLING IT OUT.
NAVITI GETTING CLOSER WITH
ANOTHER PIECE.
PERFECT, GOOD.
Jeff: IT IS NOW MALOLO DOWN
TO TWO PIECES AND NAVITI DOWN TO
TWO PIECES.
WHICH TRIBE WILL FINISH?
DESIREE YELLING FOR MALOLO.
OKAY.
SWITCH PLACES.
SWITCH PLACE.
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.
I'M DOING MY BEST.
SHIFT IT.
Jeff: DOMENICK YELLING FOR
NAVITI.
YES.
WE'RE GOOD.
Jeff: DO THEY HAVE IT?
THAT'S A PUZZLE!
NAVITI WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
MALOLO BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT TIME.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: WENDELL, ON SURVIVOR,
THE CALLER IS THE HERO OR THE
GOAT ROLE.
AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THE
CHALLENGE YOU WERE BOTH.
IN THE END, HERO ROLE.
HOLD IT OUT FOR YANUA.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
ANOTHER WIN FOR NAVITI.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
NICE JOB.
Jeff: NAVITI, YANUA, GAB
YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
Jeff: ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
ALL RIGHT, MALOLO, FOR THE FIFTH
TIME THIS SEASON, TRIBAL
COUNCIL, SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS A
COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE
TODAY.
I AM YET AGAIN GOING TO ANOTHER
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THAT WILL BE MY FIFTH TRIBAL OUT
OF SIX AND THAT REALLY SUCKS FOR
ME.
THIS IS "SURVIVOR: GHOST
ISLAND."
LIKE IT'S ALL ABOUT REVERSING
CURSES, NOT CREATING NEW ONES.
I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.
THE MINI CHALLENGE TODAY WAS
PROBABLY THE WORST MOMENT OF MY
LIFE.
I WANTED THIS TO BE MY MOMENT OF
MOVING MYSELF.
NORMALLY OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME I
JUST FEEL THAT I HAVE TO PROVE
MYSELF, AND I'M
EXCEEDING EXPECTATION, AND I
FAILED.
I JUST FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST
LOSER.
SHE'S UPSET ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE.
IN CASE WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER
CHANCE, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT, GIVING UP
MUSCLE EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT TO
WIN SO BAD?
EITHER JAMES OR ME.
BECAUSE OF ME, SOMEBODY IS GOING
HOME, AND IT SUCKS, BUT, YOU
KNOW, I'M STILL A PLAYER IN THIS
GAME.
SO THE PLAN TONIGHT IS TO VOTE
OUT JAMES.
NOBODY REALLY HAS A CONNECTION
TO JAMES.
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW
JAMES.
SO EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE ME,
JAMES IS GOING HOME.
I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO HASTY
TO JUDGE, BUT SHE CHOKED.
OH, COMPLETELY.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANGELA AT
ALL?
NO.
BECAUSE WE'RE TOAST IF WE
CAN'T GET HER.
YEAH.
AT THIS POINT THE OLD NAVITI HAS
THE NUMBERS, SO CLEARLY MICHAEL
AND I ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT.
BUT A STRONG "SURVIVOR" PLAYER
HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE DEALT SOME
BAD HANDS AND MAKE IT WORK.
WE LAST PLACE.
IT SEEMS LIKE MALOLO IS
CURSED.
YEAH.
WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD, MY
FAMILY ALL MOVED TO SOUTH KOREA.
WHEN I WAS 16 I DECIDED TO COME
BACK TO THE STATES ALONE AND
CHART MY OWN PATH IN A NEW
COUNTRY.
AND I HAD TO ADAPT TO A NEW
LIFE, A NEW LANGUAGE, A NEW
SCHOOL WITH NO FRIENDS AND LEARN
HOW THE CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.
THAT EXPERIENCE PREPARED ME FOR
THIS MOMENT, BECAUSE "SURVIVOR"
IS ABOUT CONNECTING WITH OTHER
HUMAN BEINGS.
I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE
EITHER OF US TONIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS RIGHT
NOW?
I MEAN, I THINK KELLYN AND
DES HAVE A REALLY CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP, SO I'M PROBABLY ON
THE BOTTOM.
UH-HUH.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?
I DEFINITELY THOUGHT IT WAS YOU
GUYS VOTING FOR ME AND IT WAS MY
OWN PEOPLE.
WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU, YOU
WORK WITH ME, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF ANYTHING.
I DO TRUST JAMES, AND THIS
GAME IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.
IN THE MILITARY, IT WAS LIKE A
FAMILY.
I WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY GREAT
FRIENDS, AND THEN RETIRING, I
LOST THAT BIG CHUNK OF FAMILY.
AND THEN MY DAUGHTER WENT AWAY
TO COLLEGE, AND THEN I STARTED
GOING THROUGH MY DIVORCE.
AND NOW I'M ALONE.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST HARD.
IT'S JUST HARD.
BUT IT IS GOOD, BECAUSE I WAS
RAISED TO LIKE FOCUS ON
EVERYBODY ELSE'S HAPPINESS.
NOW I'M FOCUSED ON ME AND TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WANT TO GO
AND WHAT I WANT TO DO.
SO WHAT... ARE YOU AND MICHAEL
ON THE SAME LINE?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
HE AND I ON THE SAME PAGE,
WE'RE GOING TO ACT TOGETHER.
REALLY?
YEAH, SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO
GO WITH US?
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH STRENGTH.
I WANT US TO GET THROUGH
TONIGHT TOGETHER SAFELY AND COME
BACK TO THIS CAMP.
WITH JAMES I'VE HAD A LOT OF
GENUINE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.
WHILE I WOULD LIKE THE STAY
LOYAL TO NAVITI, I HAVE TO WATCH
OUT FOR ME FIRST.
SO NOW THE ONLY QUESTION IS
WHAT'S GOING TO GET ME FURTHER
IN THE GAME.
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT TONIGHT?
I'M NOT SURE.
ME, BRADLEY, C BASS, CHELSEA,
AND DES THE WHOLE TIME.
THERE WAS NEVER A QUESTION ABOUT
IT.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS NOW?
I AM HOPE THANK YOU WANT TO
WORK WITH ME.
I THOUGHT ANGELA WOULD BE
WILLING TO WORK WITH ME AND DES.
INSTEAD SHE'S ACTING SUPER
PARANOID AND THAT MAKES ME
REALLY NERVOUS.
BECAUSE I CAN SEE ANGELA WANTING
TO SAVE JAMES AND COMING AFTER
ME OR DES.
I FEEL SUPER GOOD WITH DES.
SHE AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER THE
WHOLE TIME.
WELL, WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, IF
YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY.
I KNOW DES ANDRY GOING TO VOTE
TOGETHER, SO I WOULD LOVE FOR
YOU TO WORK WITH THE TWO OF US.
WELL, STICKING WITH IT WHEN
IT GETS CHAOTIC.
THAT'S WHEN THINGS GET SKETCHY.
I FEEL MORE UNCOMFORTABLE
GOING INTO THIS TRIBAL THAN I
HAVE FELT FROM THE WHOLE GAME.
FROM THE BEGINNING I HAVE NEVER
100% BEEN ABLE TO TRUST ANGELA.
SHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.
I'M NOT SURE SHE FULLY
UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON IN
HER OWN HEAD, AND SOMEONE LIKE
THAT IS JUST DANGEROUS.
I'M JUST PRAYING TO GOD THIS
WORKS OUT.
BUT TONIGHT IS GOING TO TELL US
IF NAVITI HAVE FINALLY BROKEN
DOWN.
WHETHER IT'S STILL ABOUT ORANGE
AND PURPLE OR IF EVERYTHING IS
JUST TURNED BROWN.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO WE ALL KNOW THE HEADLINE:
MALOLO MAY BE ONE OF THE WORST
TRIBES IN TERMS OF CHALLENGE
PERFORMANCE THAT WE'VE EVER HAD.
YOU MAY NEVER WIN A "SURVIVOR"
CHALLENGE AS A TRIBE.
DESIREE, WHAT IS THE FEELING
INSIDE WHEN YOU'RE DOWN TRIBAL
AFTER TRIBAL AFTER TRIBAL?
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOSE,
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM, WHEN
THINGS AREN'T GREAT, YOU GET A
CHANCE TO REFLECT ON WHO IT IS
THAT YOU REALLY ARE AS IF YOU
HAVE A MIRROR RIGHT IN FRONT OF
YOU, AND I TAKE FULL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TODAY'S LOSS.
AND I LET MYSELF DOWN THE MOST.
Jeff: HOW SO?
LIKE I WANTED THIS TO BE MY
MOMENT WHERE I COULD SAY, I DID
THAT AND IT WASN'T.
IT WAS LIKE, I DID THAT, OH, MY
GOD.
BUT WHAT MAKES A WINNER IS HOW
YOU GET BACK UP WHEN YOU FALL.
SO FROM HERE ON, I JUST HAVE TO
GET BACK UP.
Jeff: JAMES, THERE WAS A
CHALLENGE WHERE YOU FELT SOME
RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU GOT VOTES, AND YOU SAID,
YEAH, I DESERVED THEM.
WOULD THAT BE FAIR TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT BASED ONÃ±r BLOWING 
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS TOUGH,
BECAUSE I MYSELF WAS GIVE AN
SECOND CHANCE BY MY TRIBE
DESPITE A BIG MISTAKE, AND IT
WILL JUST COME DOWN TO WHAT
PEOPLE PRIORITIZE ON TONIGHT'S
VOTE I GUESS.
Jeff: KELLYN, IT HAS TO GO
THROUGH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU'RE
EVALUATING WHO TO VOTE OUT THE
ABILITY TO WIN, BECAUSE IF YOU
DON'T WIN, YOU WON'T MAKE THE
MERGE, YOU WON'T MAKE THE END.
YEAH.
TO FEEL YANUYA WIN AND THEN TO
FEEL NAVITI WIN, IT JUST FEELS
AWFUL.
SO THE THINK THAT'S NOT COMING
INTO ALL OF OUR MINDS, I THINK
WOULD BE A FARCE.
I THINK WE ALL WANT TO WIN.
Jeff: ANGELA, WHERE DO YOU
WEIGH IN ON THIS?
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO
CRITICIZE SOMEBODY WHO IS GIVING
THEIR BEST.
ABSOLUTELY.
SOMEBODY DEFINITELY HAS TO CARRY
THE TORCH.
IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE THAT
STRENGTH, I THINK YOU SHOULD DO
IT, BUT IF YOU STEP UP TO THE
PLATE, THEN WE'RE EXPECTING YOU
NOT TO STRIKE OUT.
WE'RE EXPECTING YOU TO HIT A
HOME RUN.
Jeff: SO DESIREE, IT CAN'T
FEEL GOOD THE HEAR THAT.
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO HEAR
THAT, YOU KNOW, BUT IF WE'RE
THINKING AHEAD AND WE'RE
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR
GAME, BRUTE STRENGTH IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO GO UP
AGAINST WHEN IT COMES TO
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES.
Jeff: JAMES, DESIREE HAS
THROWN IT RIGHT BACK AT THE
GROUP AND SAID, MAYBE IT'S
STRENGTH, BUT "SURVIVOR" IS A
LONG GAME AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
LAYERS TO IT.
WHAT DO YOU READ INTO WHAT
DESIREE IS SAYING?
I THINK DESIREE HAS A FAIR
POINT.
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WITH GREAT
PHYSICAL ABILITIES IN MERGES A
THREAT POST-MERGE, BUT WE AS A
TRIBE ARE SO CLOSE TO THE MERGE,
AND WE HAVE TO GET THERE.
THAT PATH IS ONE OF BRUTE
STRENGTH.
Jeff: MICHAEL, YOU WERE
NODDED LIKE LET'S JUST GET TO
THE MERGE FIRST AND THEN FIGURE
OUT WHO TO GET RID OF.
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND.
IF YOU CAN'T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO
WHERE IT MATTERS, WHAT'S THE BIG
POINT?
I WANT TO WIN.
I KNOW EVERYBODY HERE WANTS TO
WIN.
SO JUST GET TO THE MERGE, WE
NEED TO FOCUS ON KEEPING THE
TRIBE STRONG.
BUT, THE OTHER PARTED OF
THIS, WHICH IS CRAZY, WE MADE
HIT THE FAR IN TRIBAL, AND IT
HASN'T COME UP YET, BUT THERE
ARE THREE ORIGINAL NAVITI
MEMBERS SITTING HERE, AND TWO
ORIGINAL MALOLO MEMBERS.
SO YOU START TO PLAY THE GAME IN
YOUR HEAD AND YOU LOOK AT THE
MATH, AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME
THAT LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS ARE
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BRUTE
STRENGTH.
Jeff: JAMES, HOW CONCERNED
ARE YOU THAT OLD TRIBAL
ALLIANCES MIGHT BE WHAT FLIPS IT
TONIGHT?
YEAH, IN THAT CASE IT LOOKS
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS FOR
MYSELF AND MICHAEL, BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO THOSE OLD ORIGINAL
TRIBE LINES, WHICH WERE RANDOM
TO BEGIN WITH, YOU CAN'T BE SO
MYOPIC LIKE THAT.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT
KINDS OF BONDS WITH DIFFERENT
PEOPLE.
REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE TO THE
OTHER SIDE, THAT'S A PRETTY
CRITICAL PART OF "SURVIVOR" I
THINK.
Jeff: ANGELA, THAT'S REALLY
INTERESTING WHAT JAMES SAID,
YES, WE WERE ON DIFFERENT
TRIBES, BUT THOSE WERE RANDOM,
BUT THE WAY, WE DON'T BLEED
NAVITI OR MALOLO.
IT'S JUST A BUFF.
IT OPENS UP WHEN AND HOW YOU CAN
MAKE A RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD
LAST.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON DAY
ONE.
ABSOLUTELY.
ME BEING ON NAVITI, IT WAS JUST
A CHANCE.
AND EVERY ONE OF MY ORIGINAL
TRIBE VOTED AGAINST ME.
MALOLO, THEY DIDN'T DIRECTLY
SAVE ME, BUT INDIRECTLY THAT'S
THE REASON I'M SITTING HERE
TODAY.
Jeff: CURIOUS.
QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOU, JUST A
QUICK ANSWER: IN LIFE TYPICALLY,
DO YOU LEAD WITH YOUR HEAD OR
YOUR HEART ANGELA?
HEAD.
HEART.
HEAD.
HEAD.
Jeff: KELLYN?
TO ME YOUR GUT IS THE PERFECT
MIX OF YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART.
WHEN YOU FIND AND FOLLOW WHAT
YOUR GUT IS TELLING YOU, IT'S
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LET YOUR HEART
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'VE
LET YOUR HEAD SPEAK A LITTLE
BIT.
FIND WHERE THAT SETTLES IN AND
MAKE YOUR DECISION FROM THERE.
Jeff: 36 SEASONS INTO
"SURVIVOR," I'M STILL BEING
TAUGHT HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED BY
THE PLAYERS.
I LOVE IT.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, IT'S TIME
TO VOTE.
DESIREE, YOU'RE UP.
IT WAS EITHER YOU OR ME.
I'M HOPING IT'S YOU.
I WAS GIVE AN SECOND CHANCE,
AND I REALLY, REALLY WERE I
COULD GIVE IT TO YOU, TOO.
I'M SORRY.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE JAMES.
DESIREE.
ONE VOTE JAMES, ONE VOTE
DESIREE.
JAMES.
THAT'S TWO VOTES JAMES, ONE VOTE
DESIREE.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND," JAMES.
THAT'S THREE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JAMES, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
GREAT BLIND SIDE, GUIDE.
IT'S BEEN A TRUE PLEASURE
PLAYING WITH YOU ALL AND BEST OF
LUCK.
Jeff: WELL, YOUR HEAD, YOUR
HEART, AND ULTIMATELY YOUR GUT
LED YOU TO VOTE OUT ONE OF THE
STRONGEST MEMBERS OF THIS TRIBE.
TIME WILL TELL IF YOU MADE THE
RIGHT CALL.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
Captioning funded by CBS
We go further, so you can.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THERE'S FIRE AT
MALOLO.
WE SHOULD BURN THE MALOLO
FLAG.
IT'S BAD JUJU.
I'M NEXT TO GO, BUT HOPEFULLY
THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE
TUNNEL.
Jeff: AND FURY AT NAVITI.
THE HARDEST TEST FOR ME IS TO
NOT BE A TOTAL DICK.
HE'S A NASTYSON OF A BITCH.
THE FIRE IS RAGING.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT BLIND SIDE
COMING.
GOOD FOR THEM.
I'M AT PEACE.
THESE 17 DAY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A
FRACTION OF MY LIFE, HAVE REALLY
CHANGED ME.
I'LL GO BACK TO THE REAL WORLD
AS A NEW PERSON WITH A NEW
PERSPECTIVE.
SO I AM HUMBLE AND GRATEFUL.
TO SAY I HAVE PLAYED "SURVIVOR."
