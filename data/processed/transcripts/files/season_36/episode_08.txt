         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE, THE
WAR BETWEEN DOMENICK AND CHRIS
ERUPTED.
 IT'S LIKE AN ARMS RACE, AND
THESE TWO GUYS CAN BLOW UP THE
WORLD IF THEY WANT.
 Jeff: BUT ANGELA AND
DESIREE HAD A TARGET OF THEIR
OWN.
 I THINK IT WOULD BE LIBBY.
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI GIRLS CAN
FLIP THIS TO GET WHO I WANT OUT,
WHICH IS LIBBY.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DOMENICK BLUFFED WITH HIS FAKE
IDOL.








I'M JUST GOING THE WEAR IT.
AND IT'S THE SHELL.
 Jeff: AND PLAY HIS LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
 I'M PLAYING IT TONIGHT FOR
MYSELF.
 Jeff: ALTHOUGH LIBBY
RECEIVED VOTES, CHRIS WAS SENT
TO THE JURY.
CHRIS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 THANK YOU, FOLKS.
 Jeff: 12 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 LET'S GET THIS FIRE GOING.
 WELL, FIRST MERGE TRIBAL,
COUNTS FOR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
 PRETTY WACKY, RIGHT?
 MY NAME HAS COME UP NOW THREE
TRIBALS IN A ROW, AND I DON'T








KNOW WHY.
EMOTIONALLY YOU JUST WONDER
WHERE PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE, BUT
WHATEVER I'M DOING, I MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG TO MAKE
MYSELF NOTICEABLE.
SO I JUST NEED THE MAKE SURE
THAT I KEEP MY EYE OUT FOR
SOMETHING TO HELP ME OUT A
LITTLE BIT.
 I LIKE THE SHELL NECKLACE.
 I COULDN'T GET HIM OFF MY
BACK, MAN.
IT'S A HUGE RELIEF TO HAVE CHRIS
OFF MY BECOME AFTER ALL THIS
TIME.
IT'S BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR SO
LONG.
I COULD DIE IN PEACE.
HE WAS AFTER ME.
I'M NOT GLOATING TONIGHT.
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR
CHRIS.
I KNOW I MADE A SHOW OUT THERE
OF IT, BUT IT WAS NOT A PROUD
MOMENT FOR ME.
THE ONE THING I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT IN MY PERFORMANCE AT
TRIBAL IS THEY MAY THINK THAT
MAYBE I AM THE THREAT THAT CHRIS
THOUGHT I WAS, SO I REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO COME OFF COCKY OR
ARROGANT, BECAUSE THE SECOND I
DO THAT, THEY WILL TARGET ME
NEXT, BUT IF I CAN TAKE A STEP
BECOME AND NOT CALL SHOTS FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I WILL HAVE
SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH THESE
PEOPLE.
PLUS I STILL ARE MY ACTUAL IDOL
MANY MY POCKET, WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE THE WAR IS FAR FROM
OVER.
BECAUSE THE WAR IS FAR FROM
OVER.
 HE'S MAKING A KITCHEN.
 I FEEL LIKE TRIBAL WENT HOW
WE INTENDED IT TO GO.
PRETTY MUCH A CLEAN SWEEP OF
CHRIS, FINALLY GETTING HIM OUT
OF HERE, BUT GOING FORWARD FROM
A CHRIS VOTE, IT'S A LOT LESS
PREDICTABLE.
THERE ARE SO MANY SIDE
CONVERSATIONS, YOU SEE EVERYONE
TALKING TO EVERYONE.
SO MY PLAN IS TO STICK TO THE
FOUR THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT, SO MYSELF, DOMENICK,
LAUREL, AND DONATHAN.
AND WE BRING IN OUR RESERVES
FROM THERE.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 I'M OKAY.
 YOU SEEM A LITTLE ELUSIVE.
 FROM YOU?
 YEAH.
 NO, I'M GOOD.
I WOULD TELL YOU IF I WASN'T.
 I BASE A LOT OF MY PLAY OFF
NON-VERBAL THINGS.
I CAN TELL LAUREL HAS BEEN A
LITTLE HESITANT, AND SHE GETS
PARANOID, SO THE MORE SECURE SHE
IS, THE BETTER IT IS FOR OUR
ALLIANCE.
 SO YOU KNOW DOM HAS AN IDOL.
 HE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A REAL
ONE.
 HE HAS A REAL ONE.
HE IS PLAYING PEOPLE WITH THAT
SHELL.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT, BUT HE SAYS
HE HAS ONE, SO THAT IS AT OUR
DISPOSAL, WE CAN GO TO THE END.
 I'M WITH YOU GUYS.
 IF WE'RE FOUR STRONG, THERE'S
NO FOURSOMES OUT HERE.
 NO.
 ARE YOU 1,000% TOP FOUR WITH
ME.
 YES.
1,000%.
I MEAN, THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE
THAT I EVEN WANT TO WORK WITH.
 OKAY.
OKAY.
I PROMISE YOU I'M TOP FOUR WITH
YOU.
I HAVE AN IDOL ALSO.
 WHAT?
 YES.
 I KNOW YOU'RE LYING TO ME
RIGHT NOW.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME A LIE?
 WHY DO I NOT HAVE ONE?
 BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD
ME BEFORE.
 NO.
 DOMENICK AND WENDELL HAVE A
LOT OF POWER AND A LOT OF PULL.
NOW HE TELLS ME HE FOUND AN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
THAT'S ONE MORE TIME I FELT IN
THE DARK.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
OF COURSE, DOM HAD THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE AND DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT IT.
SO IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SEE
ANOTHER THING GO THEIR WAY, AND
FOR THEM TO GET ANOTHER PIECE OF
POWER.
 YOU'RE THE SECOND PERSON THAT
KNOWS THAT.
THIS IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T WANT
TO SHARE WITH ANYONE.
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M TELLING
YOU.
 EVERY DAY WENDELL AND I TELL
EACH OTHER WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S
BACK 100%, BUT I THINK HE'S
SHOWN I CAN ONLY TRUST HIM TO A
CERTAIN POINT.
 YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND RIGHT
NOW.
 YEAH.
THAT'S... NOW ALL MY CARDS ARE
ON THE TABLE.
FOUR PEOPLE, TWO IDOL, WE'RE THE
MOST POWERFUL COMBINATION IN
THIS GAME.
LET'S GET RID OF PEOPLE.
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WENDELL, HE AND DOM HAVE TOO
MUCH POWER RIGHT NOW.
 SHE'S 1,000% WITH US.
 OKAY.
 AT SOME POINT I NEED TO SHAKE
THINGS UP.
NOW THAT WE'RE AT THE MERGE,
THIS IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO START
THE MAKE THE MOVES.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 SURE.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'RE GOING TO DIVIDE INTO TWO
TEAMS OF SIX.
ON MY GO YOU'LL RACE ACROSS A
FLOATING BRIDGE TO A SLINGSHOT.
YOU'LL USE IT TO LAUNCH SANDBAGS
AT A SERIES OF TARGETS.
THE FIRST TEAM TO KNOCK DOWN ALL
SIX OF THEIR TARGETS WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THE WINNING SIX WILL
ENJOY AN AFTERNOON OF TACOS.
 OH, GOD.
 Jeff: BURRITOS.
QUESADILLAS.
 OH, MAN.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: AND MARGARITAS.
[APPLAUSE]
AT THE "SURVIVOR" TACO HUT.
IN ADDITION, THE WINNING SIX
WILL SEND SOMEBODY FROM THE
LOSING TEAM TO GHOST ISLAND.
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK.
DRAW FOR CAPTAINS AND WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
RUNNING FOR ORANGE, DOMENICK,
KELLYN, JENNA, SEBASTIAN,
DESIREE AND MICHAEL TAKING ON
ANGELA, LAUREL, WENDELL, LIBBY,
CHELSEA, AND DONATHAN FOR
REWARD.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 YOU CAN DO IT, DOM.
 Jeff: DOMENICK AND WENDELL
FIRST.
 YOU GOT IT, WENDELL.
 Jeff: WENDELL, THAT IS HOW
YOU DO IT.
 GO, WENDELL.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: WENDELL WILL BE TO
THE SLINGSHOT FIRST.
 COME ON, DOM.
YOU'RE ALL OVER IT.
 Jeff: WENDELL GOING WAY
BACK.
AND HE CONNECTS.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THAT'S ONE FOR
PURPLE.
 GOOD JOB, WENDELL.
 Jeff: WENDELL HEADS BACK
NOW.
YOU GOT TO GET ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THAT PLATFORM.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO SHOOT AT
LEAST ONCE.
LAUREL NOW HEADING OUT FOR
PURPLE.
 WE BELIEVE IN YOU.
DOMENICK FIRES, AND THAT ONE
CONNECTS.
DOMENICK'S GOOD.
WE ARE TIED 1-1 WITH A GIANT
REWARD.
HERE COMES LAUREL.
 YES!
 Jeff: LAUREL FIRES AND
CONNECTS FOR PURPLE.
PURPLE NOW LEADS 2-1.
SEBASTIAN LAUNCHES HIGH AND VERY
DEEP.
 THAT'S TOO HIGH.
A LITTLE LOWER.
 Jeff: HERE COMES DONATHAN.
 OKAY, DONATHAN.
 Jeff: DONATHAN COULD EXTEND
THE LEAD FOR PURPLE.
 HE'S GOING TOO DEEP.
NO!
 COME BACK, COME BACK, COME
BACK!
 Jeff: SEBASTIAN CANNOT GET
IT DONE.
HE IS HIGH EVERY TIME.
BIG-TIME SETBACK FOR ORANGE.
DONATHAN, THAT SLINGSHOT MORE
POWERFUL THAN HE IS.
 PULL IT BACK A LITTLE HARDER.
 Jeff: HERES BACK AND FIRES,
CAN'T GET IT DONE.
 COME BACK.
 Jeff: DONATHAN IS GOING TO
GIVE UP AND HEAD BACK.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR ORANGE
TO TIE IT UP.
MICHAEL FIRES.
THAT WAS ONLINE.
JUST MISSES.
HERE COMES ANGELA FOR PURPLE.
WAY SHORT.
 COME BACK, ANG.
COME BACK.
PURPLE HAS A STRATEGY.
THEY WANT TO GET THEIR WEAKER
PLAYERS OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SO THE STRONGER PLAYERS CAN GET
BACK IN.
 WE HAVE TO GET ONE RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: RIGHT ON TARGET THAT.
WILL DO IT.
WE ARE TIED 2-2.
 LET'S GOSH, LET'S GO, LET'S
GO!
 Jeff: HERE'S CHELSEA FOR
PURPLE.
COME BACK!
 Jeff: CHELSEA FULFILLING
HER GOAL OF PARTICIPATING NOW
HEADS BACK.
 I'M SO READY.
I'M SO READY.
 Jeff: HERE COMES KELLYN.
FOUR TARGETS LEFT FOR BOTH
TEAMS.
TACO HUT ON THE LINE.
 YOU GOT IT, KEL.
 Jeff: RELEASES.
SHORT.
 COME BACK.
COME BACK.
 Jeff: KELLYN HEADS BACK.
ORANGE NOW USING PURPLE'S
STRATEGY.
 PULL BACK HARD, LIB.
 Jeff: COME ON BACK, LIB.
LIBBY TAKES ONE SHOT.
SHE HEADS BACK.
 YOU GOT IT, WENDELL.
 Jeff: A LOT OF STRATEGY
COMING INTO PLAY NOW.
HERE COMES WENDELL.
EVERYBODY HAS GONE FOR PURPLE.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE
STRONGER PLAYERS NOW.
HERE COMES DESIREE.
 GO, DES, GO, DES.
 Jeff: NICE RELEASE.
SHE JUST MISSES THE TARGET.
SHE'S ONLINE, THOUGH.
DESIREE COULD PUT ORANGE AHEAD
RIGHT HERE.
WENDELL FIRES FOR PURPLE AND
WENDELL CONNECTS AGAIN ON HIS
FIRST SHOT.
THAT'S THREE FOR PURPLE.
 OH, MY GOD THAT.
KID IS ON FIRE.
 Jeff: WENDELL HAS TO GO
BACK, SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO GO IN
BETWEEN.
 COME BACK, DES.
 Jeff: DESIREE GIVING UP AND
HEADING BACK.
HERE COMES LAUREL FOR PURPLE.
LAUREL HAS BEEN STRONG IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
 YOU GOT IT, LAUREL.
 Jeff: THERE IT IS FOR
LAUREL.
THAT'S GOOD!
LAUREL SCORES THE FOURTH TARGET
FOR PURPLE.
JENNA WITH HER FIRST TOSS.
WEAK.
IN THE SAND.
JENNA NOW BEING TOLD TO GO BACK.
AND HERE COMES WENDELL BACK.
PURPLE HAS FOUR OF THEIR SIX
DOWN.
ORANGE ONLY HAS TWO.
DOMENICK HAS GOT TO PICK UP THE
PACE FOR ORANGE.
 HOW YOU DOING, DOM?
 GOOD.
HOW YOU DOING?
 I'M ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW.
 TACOS, DOM!
 Jeff: EVERYBODY WANTS IT.
DOMENICK SCORES FOR ORANGE.
THAT'S THREE.
WENDELL FIRES.
 YES!
 Jeff: WENDELL KNOCKS OFF
FIFTH.
PURPLE IS DOWN TO THEIR LAST
TARGET.
 LET'S GO, MICHAEL!
 Jeff: MICHAEL TRYING TO
CLOSE THE GAP WITH THIS LAUNCH.
MICHAEL SCORES FOR ORANGE.
MICHAEL HAS TO GET BACK.
PURPLE DOWN ONE TARGET.
ORANGE DOWN TO TWO.
LAUREL CAN WIN IT FOR PURPLE.
DOMENICK HEADING BACK OUT.
LAUREL RUNNING OUT OF STEAM.
 SHE MIGHT BE GETTING
FATIGUED.
 I'M READY.
 Jeff: LAUREL BACK,
RELEASES.
LAUREL SHORT.
SHE'S EXHAUSTED.
LAUREL IS GOING TO HEAD BACK.
THAT IS THE OPENING ORANGE
NEEDS.
DOMENICK JUST MISSES.
 COME ON.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: YOU DO NOT WANT TO
LET WENDELL BACK.
IT IS WENDELL AND DOMENICK AGAIN
SIDE BY SIDE.
 COME ON.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY CAN TASTE
THOSE TACOS.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 YOU GOT IT!
 Jeff: WENDELL COULD WIN IT
FOR PURPLE RIGHT HERE.
 MISS IT.
COME ON.
 Jeff: WENDELL TAKES HIS
TIME FOR THE WIN... AND HE DOES
IT!
PURPLE WINS REWARD.
 WE GET TACOS.
 WE'RE EATING GOOD TODAY,
GUYS.
 HOW DID WE LOSE THAT, GUYS?
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
PURPLE, IN ADDITION TO A NICE
AFTERNOON, YOU DECIDE WHO GOES
TO GHOST ISLAND.
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
IF YOU CAN UNANIMOUSLY CHOOSE
ONE PERSON, YOU SEND THEM.
OTHERWISE THEY DRAW ROCKS.
 ROCKS IT, IS JEFF.
 Jeff: ROCKS IT IS.
PALMS OUT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
WHITE IS GOING TO GHOST ISLAND.
JENNA SELECTS THE WHITE ROCK.
JENNA HEADING TO GHOST ISLAND.
JENNA, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
DOWN, THE BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.
SIX PEOPLE WILL ENJOY REWARD.
FIVE WILL GO BACK THE CAMP.
AND JENNA HEADS TO GHOST ISLAND
ALONE.
YOU WILL RETURN BACK TO CAMP
TOMORROW MORNING.
WENDELL, LIBBY, LAUREL, CHELSEA,
ANGELA, DONATHAN, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY.
FILL THOSE BELLIES.
DESIREE, SEBASTIAN, DOMENICK,
KELLYN, MICHAEL, GOT NOTHING FOR
YOU.
GRAB YOUR
CAMP.
 I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS
REWARD.
I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
TODAY TO BE ABLE TO START
FORMING STRONGER BONDS AND MAYBE
I CAN STRENGTHEN A BOND THAT'S
NOT SO STRONG.
SO HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THE
TARGET OFF MY BACK
 RIGHT NOW I'M IN THIS PLACE
OF BEING ON THE BOTTOM.
TODAY WHEN I GOT THAT ROCK, IT
WAS WEIRD.
I WAS ALMOST EXCITED TO GO.
I'VE HEARD THAT YOU CAN PLAY FOR
AN ADVANTAGE OR A DISADVANTAGE.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO HAVE A
POSITIVE OUTLOOK ABOUT BEING
HERE, BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL
PLAYING AN INDIVIDUAL GAME AT
THIS POINT.
SO I'M TRYING SEE IF I CAN GET
AN ADVANTAGE AND REALLY HELP
PROPEL MYSELF TO THE END.
WE'RE READY.
PLEASE LET ME HAVE SOMETHING IN
HERE.
NOPE, NOT TODAY, NO GAME FOR
YOU.
I SMASHED MY URN AND IT SAID,
"NO GAME FOR YOU," IT WAS RATHER
DISAPPOINTING.
COMING THE GHOST ISLAND, YOU
FEEL LIKE, WHAT'S THE POINT IF
I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY A GAME.
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE TALKING BACK
AT CAMP, AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING
TO BE HAPPENING WITHOUT ME.
I'M JUST LIKE EVEN MORE PISSED
OFF THAT I'M NOT ABOUT TO EAT A
HUGE MEXICAN FEAST.
MY POSITIVE ATTITUDE HAS GONE
DOWN THE DRAIN TODAY.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
 TIKI TACO HUT.
OUR TEAM DIDN'T LOOK LIKE WE
WERE GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE ALL THE BIGGEST GUYS IN
THE WORLD ON THE OTHER TEAM, AN
WE COME OUT AND FIND A WAY TO
WIN THIS BEAUTIFUL REWARD.
 LOOK AT THE MARGUERITES.
AND BEER.
 HEAVEN.
 GET TO WORK.
 BURRITO, NACHOS, ENCHILADAS,
WHATEVER YOU CAN THINK OF.
 GAUCAMOLE, YOU GUYS.
 GUAC.
 ESPECIALLY GAUCAMOLE.
I'D PROBABLY RISK IMMUNITY FOR
GUACAMOLE OUT HERE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE MUSCLE,
BUT WE OUTTHOUGHT THEM TODAY.
LET'S ENJOY.
 CHEERS.
 ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I AM
EXTRA THANKFUL TO BE HERE WITH
LAUREL.
 CHEERS FROM AFAR.
 SHE'S BEEN AN ALLY OF MINE
FOR THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS.
SUPER STRONG COMPETITOR, BUT SHE
SEEMED A LITTLE SHAKY THIS
MORNING.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE HER OUT HERE
TO TIGHTEN OUR BOND.
AND I ALSO HAVE DONATHAN OUT
HERE, LAUREL'S RIGHT-HAND MAN,
WHO I WANT TO BE VERY CLOSE
WITH, BECAUSE ME, DOMENICK,
LAUREL AND DONATHAN ARE MY TOP
FOUR.
 LAST NIGHT WAS EPIC.
 YEAH.
 LIKE I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF
THAT.
I MEAN, ALL OF YOU GUYS
OBVIOUSLY SAW IT, BUT I DID NOT
SEE IT.
 I DIDN'T SEE IT.
AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
DOING WRONG.
TELL ME IF I'M DOING SOMETHING
WRONG.
 BECAUSE OF YOUR NAME?
 YES.
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
I THINK IT WAS AN EASY NAME, NOT
ANYTHING BAD.
 I THINK IT WAS ORIGINALLY YOU
AND MICHAEL WERE CLOSE, AND I
THINK THAT'S WHERE YOUR NAME
EVEN CAME AROUND.
 ONCE YOU HAVE THAT TAG OR
BULL'S-EYE ON YOUR BACK, IT'S
HARD TO GET RID OF.
 THE REASON WHY MY NAME WAS
WRITTEN DOWN IS BECAUSE OF
MICHAEL, BECAUSE THEY THINK
WE'RE A POWER COUPLE, AND IT
SUCKS, BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE IN
AN ALIGNS WITH HIM, BUT AT THIS
POINT RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO MAKE
A MOVE.
AND GET MY GAME STRONGER.
 I FEEL LIKE THE SUN'S GOING
TO COME OUT TODAY AND IT'S GOING
TO BE GREAT.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
GAME?
 I'M FEELING GOOD.
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY
GOOD HAVING CHRIS OUT OF HERE.
I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT
PERSON TO GO.
 I THINK EVERYBODY IS IN
CONSENSUS WITH THAT.
 CHRIS WAS AN EASY VOTE.
THERE WAS NO GIANT SPLIT AND NO
LINES WERE TRULY DRAWN, WHICH IS
USUALLY THE CASE WITH THE FIRST
VOLT AFTER THE MERGE, SO NOW
THAT CHRIS IS GONE, IT'S MORE OF
AN EVERY MAN FOR THEMSELVES, AND
RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING SOLIDIFY MY
ALLIANCE AND MAKING SURE I'M
SETTING MYSELF UP FOR THE BEST
END GAME POSSIBLE.
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT
THE GUY, COME -- DOM AND
WENDELL, THE PAIR.
 THEY'RE BOTH STRONG.
 WENDELL AND DOMENICK, THEM
TWO AS A PAIR IS REALLY
DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THEY'RE
WORKING TOGETHER, AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET
THE BIGGEST THREAT BETWEEN THE
TWO OF THEM OUT.
 WHO WOULD YOU DO FIRST,
THOUGH?
 ID PROBABLY SAY WENDELL.
I THINK THAT ANGELA GOT WORRIED
AFTER THE VOTE OUT OF CHRIS, SO
I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SHE
MIGHT BE KIND OF AN EXTRA NUMBER
FOR US AS FAR AS THE NEXT VOTE
GOES.
 YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON OUT
OF THE LOOP LAST TIME.
 YEAH.
 THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD
TRUST YOU.
 THROUGHOUT MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHRIS, HE WASN'T OPEN TO
ANY IDEA BUT HIS OWN, SO NOW I
FEEL THAT I'M FREE TO PLAY MY
OWN GAME, AND I'M DEFINITELY
GOING TO USE WHAT I LEARNED IN
THE MILITARY BEING WITH MY
PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS AND
CIVIL AFFAIRS UNIT, AND I'M
GOING TO STIR THE POT.
I'M GOING TO GET SOME EMOTIONS
GOING.
 THIS IS WHAT MICHAEL SAID, I
SHOULDN'T TRUST YOU GUYS BECAUSE
IT WAS YOU AND CHELSEA THAT
DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE THE
INFORMATION ABOUT CHRIS.
WHEN PEOPLE START HEARING THEIR
NAME IS PUT OUT, THEY GET IN
DEFENSE MODE.
IT STARTS A WAR.
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
I WANT TO SEE THE BATTLE OF ALL
BATTLES.
 I JUST GOT PISSED OFF FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
 WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?
 I WANT TO BE THE TRIUMPH
THAT'S HOLDING THAT SWORD AT THE
END OF THE WAR AND ALL THESE
CASUALTIES ARE LAYING DOWN AND
I'M STANDING TALL AND PROUD,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I MADE THOSE
CASUALTIES.
 WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE ON THE
SAME PAGE.
I THINK THAT PAGE RIGHT NOW
IS...
 I WENT OVER TO TALK TO
MICHAEL.
HE SAID, "I WANT TO BREAK UP THE
DOM AND WENDELL ALLIANCE.
I SAID WELL, IF YOU WERE TO PICK
ONE, HE SAID, I'D RATHER GET
WENDELL OFF FIRST.
 MICHAEL?
 MICHAEL.
I LIKE THIS KID.
 HE SAID WENDELL IS GOING TO
CONTINUE TO WIN AND HE'S STRONG.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE MICHAEL HAS
BEEN THROWING MY NAME OUT THERE
AS TARGET.
MICHAEL HAS BEEN STIRRING UP THE
POT.
HE'S BEEN RUNNING AROUND
THROWING EVERYBODY UNDER THE
BUS.
MAYBE WE AGAIN HAVE A COMMON
EASY VOTE.
SO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, KELLYN, GOT
TO TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.
 FUN WHILE IT LASTED.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO COMPETE IN
A "SURVIVOR" CLASSIC.
THIS DATES BACK TO SEASON ONE.
IT IS A "SURVIVOR" FOOD-EATING
COMPETITION.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
IT WILL PLAY IN ROUNDS.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, THE SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
THE END IS WITHIN SIGHT NOW.
YOU DON'T WANT THE LET SOMETHING
AS SIMPLE AS MIND OVER MATTER
STAND IN BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR
GOAL OF WINNING THIS GAME.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
REVEAL.
THE MOST NUTRITIOUS PART OF THE
FISH, THE FISH EYE.
THESE WERE GIVEN TO US BY LOCAL
FISHERMEN.
THE MEAT IS FEEDING THEIR
FAMILIES.
THE EYES ARE GOING TO FEED YOU.
ITES VERY SIMPLE.
FIRST THREE PEOPLE TO SHOW BOTH
EYES DOWN AND SHOW ME AN EMPTY
MOUTH MOVE ON.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS COULD GO QUICKLY.
SOMEONE MIGHT SWALLOW THESE OUT
OF THE GATE.
OPEN YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU'VE GOT
IT.
MICHAEL YOU'RE GOOD.
TAKE A STEP BACK.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO MORE.
LIBBY TRYING TO SHOVE IT DOWN.
JENNA STILL WORKING ON IT.
 COME ON, LIBBY, YOU GOT IT.

 Jeff: DESIREE YOU'RE GOOD,
LAUREL, YOU'RE GOOD.
LIBBY, TOO LATE.
DESIREE, LAUREL, MICHAEL MOVING
ON.
NEXT SIX, IT IS THE SAME THING.
FIRST THREE TO FINISH MOVE ONED
TO NEXT ROUND.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
WENDELL NOT EVEN CLOSE.
[COUGHING]
CHELSEA SPITS BACK UP.
ANGELA, YOU'RE GOOD.
MOVING ON.
SEBASTIAN IS GOOD, MOVING ON.
IT COMES DOWN TO KELLYN AND
DOMENICK.
ONE PERSON GOING TO MOVE ON.
BOTH CHEWING QUICKLY.
DOMENICK, YOUR GOOD, MOVING ON.
KELLYN, SECONDS AWAY.
WENDELL DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
NOW THAT YOU'RE WARMED UP, LET'S
MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING.
GO AHEAD AND REVEAL.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: IT WOULDN'T BE A
"SURVIVOR" EATING CHALLENGE
WITHOUT THIS.
THIS IS THE BEET L LARVA, THE
GRUB THAT JERVIS COULDN'T GET
DOWN IN SEASON ONE.
WILL IT STAND BETWEEN YOU AND
YOUR GOAL OF GETTING TO THE END?
HERE WE GO, FIRST THREE TO GET
ALL THREE DOWN MOVE ON.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
DOMENICK SHOVES IT IN.
DESIREE CHEWING.
LAUREL TRYING TO TEAR IT OFF.
ANGELA IS NOT MESSING AROUND.
 GO, ANG.
GO, LAUREL.
 Jeff: MICHAEL YOU'RE GOOD.
SEBASTIAN, YOU'RE GOOD.
AND ACT IS GOOD, JUST BEATING
OUT DESIREE.
WOW.
THAT WAS FAST.
ALL RIGHT.
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.
SEBASTIAN, MICHAEL, AND ANGELA.
NOW WE'LL MOVE INTO THE
DELICACIES.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
THIS IS THE SEA SLUG.
THESE ARE ALL OVER THE OCEAN
FLOOR.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE BEEN SWIMMING
PAST THEM.
FIRST TWO TO GET BOTH ALL THE
WAY DOWN AND SHOW ME AN EMPTY
MOUTH MOVE ONED TO FINAL ROUND.
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 GO, ANG.
 Jeff: ANGELA OUT OF THE
GATE SHOVES AN ENTIRE SLUG DOWN
HER MOUTH.
WOW.
MICHAEL WORKING HARD.
SEBASTIAN TRYING THE STAY IN
THIS.
 IT'S DELICIOUS.
 Jeff: ANGELA NOW IS STUCK
AND PUTTING IT BACK OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MORE
DISTURBING.
 YOU GOT IT, ANG.
 Jeff: ANGELA NOW GOING TO
HAVE TO TEAR IT APART.
MICHAEL HAS BEEN VERY CALM,
SLOWLY WORKING THROUGH HIS FIRST
SLUG.
NOW HE'S WORKING ON THE SECOND.
NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO TRIBAL
TONIGHT WITHOUT SECURITY.
IMMUNITY IN THIS GAME IS
EVERYTHING.
MICHAEL GOT IT.
MOVING ON TO THE FINAL ROUND.
IT IS NOW SEBASTIAN AND ANGELA.
ANGELA'S GOT IT.
WE HAVE OUR SHOWDOWN.
MICHAEL VERSUS ANGELA.
GOOD JOB.
WOW.
THAT WAS A LOT OF PROTEIN.
 THAT WAS GAG-O-RIFICK, BRO.
 Jeff: SHOWDOWN BETWEEN
MICHAEL AND ANGELA, REVEAL.
ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER
DELICACIES IN FIJI, THE MOTHER
OF PEARL, THIS IS THE MEAT AND
THERE IS A LOT OF IT.
ALL RIGHT.
STAKES ARE CLEAR.
HERE WE GO FOR IMMUNITY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 GO, ANG.
 Jeff: MICHAEL AND ANGELA
BOTH WITH THE SAME STRATEGY.
THEY JUST START SHOVING IT DOWN.
THE MEAT OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL.
ANGELA IS ON FIRE.
IF SHE CAN SWALLOW IT.
 SWALLOW THAT!
 GET IT, GIRL.
 Jeff: ANGELA CONTINUES TO
SHOVE IT DOWN.
MICHAEL TRYING TO STAY IN THIS.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PICK IT
UP, BECAUSE LANG IS NOT MESSING
AROUND.
 FOCUS.
 Jeff: ANGELA STILL GOT A
HANDFUL.
BUT SHE'S GOT A BIT OF A LEAD ON
MICHAEL RIGHT NOW.
MICHAEL CANNOT TAKE TOO MUCH
TIME TO GET THIS DOWN.
YOU WANT IMMUNITY, YOU NEED TO
PICK IT UP, BROTHER, BECAUSE
LANG IS ON IT.
 BEAST MODE.
BEAST MODE, LET'S SEE IT.
 Jeff: LANG PUTS HER LAST
PIECE.
A TON OF MEAT.
MICHAEL SWALLOWS ANOTHER PIECE.
MICHAEL IS DOWN TO HIS LAST
PIECE.
IT WON'T MATTER.
ANGELA HAS IT!
LANG WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WOW, ANG.
 Jeff: GOOD JOB.
 NICE JOB.
 OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
BEAST MODE.
 DON'T KISS ME.
OH, GOD.
 I JUST WANT TO SAY I ATE IT
ALL.
 Jeff: DO IT.
[APPLAUSE]
 GOOD JOB, MICHAEL.
 Jeff: SO, MICHAEL, WHAT WAS
THAT ABOUT?
THE CHALLENGE IS OVER, AND YOU
WANTED TO FINISH.
 YEAH, I MEAN, I'M NEVER GOING
TO EAT STUFF LIKE THAT EVERY
AGAIN IN MY LIFE.
I'M PROBABLY ONLY GOING TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR" ONCE.
GOT TO DO IT WHILE I.
CAN.
 Jeff: MICHAEL, YOU WERE
CLOSE, NOT CLOSE ENOUGH.
ANGELA, COME ON OVER.
ANGELA, INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 25
TOUGH DAYS ON "SURVIVOR,"
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IT WON'T BE YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 IT'S ALWAYS A DISAPPOINTMENT
TO LOSE IMMUNITY, BUT I DO FEEL
GOOD ABOUT THE PLAN THAT I HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON THE PAST COUPLE
OF DAYS, YOU KNOW TO, BLIND SIDE
WENDELL.
WENDELL AND DOMENICK, THEY'RE A
TWO-HEADED SNAKE, SO WE GOT TO
GET WENDELL OUT.
 THE SEA SLUG SLUGGER.
 IT'S A GREAT FEELING WINNING
IMMUNITY, BUT BEATING MICHAEL
WAS DEFINITELY A PRIORITY ON MY
LIST.
AND NOW I FEEL THAT IT'S AN EASY
VOTE, BECAUSE I HAD A PLAN TO
STIR THE POT, AND IT WORKED.
SO I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE I HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF POWER RIGHT NOW.
AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
NEW AND ENERGIZING AND FUN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I THINK EVERYBODY IS ON THE
SAME PAGE.
MICHAEL.
 I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY PAGE,
THOUGH.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
 I THINK THAT THE CONSENSUS IS
THAT WE WANT TO TAKE MICHAEL OUT
TONIGHT, BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A
GROUP DECISION.
 I'M IN NO POSITION TO HAVE
CONTROL.
 I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE
YOU AREN'T IN A POSITION TO HAVE
ANY PULL.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU
GUYS... WE'RE DEPENDING ON YOU
ALL MORE THAN YOU'RE DEPENDING
ON US.
IF MICHAEL HAS THE IDOL, I THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE BACK-UP JUST IN
CASE.
I THINK IT SHOULD BE LIKE FIVE
FOR MICHAEL AND SOMEONE ELSE.
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE AT THE MERGE,
IT'S STILL THE ORIGINAL NAVITI
AND ORIGINAL MALOLO.
IF WE CAN PULL IN LAUREL AND
DONATHAN, WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTES
IN CASE THERE IS AN IDOL BETWEEN
MICHAEL AND LIBBY.
 PUT FIVE VOTES ON MICHAEL,
FOUR VOTES ON LIBBY, THAT'S IF
WE ALL STICK WITH THE PLAN.
 HI.
 HI.
 HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING FOR
TONIGHT?
 I THINK I'M STUCK IN THE
MIDDLE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
 IS NAVITI SPLITTING VOTES AND
MALOLO ACTUALLY VOTES TOGETHER,
WE COULD BLINDSIDE ANY OF THEM.
I THINK THAT NAVITI IS STAYING
STRONG, BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO
SPLIT THE VOTE, THE FIVE OF US
COULD VOTE OUT ANYBODY AT THIS
POINT.
WE'VE BEEN BROKEN APART AND
BEATEN UP.
NOW IS OUR TIME TO BE STRONG.
AND IF I DECIDE THE PLAY MY IDOL
TONIGHT, I KNOW I'M SAFE FOR ONE
MORE VOTE, BUT I'D NOT LIKE TO
DO THAT IDEALLY IF I DON'T HAVE
TO.
 WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO GO?
 I'D SAY WENDELL.
 MY CORE ALLIANCE IS MYSELF,
DONATHAN, DOMENICK, AND WENDELL,
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A REALLY
BIG MOVE TO TAKE OUT WENDELL AND
PROBABLY SOMETHING FOR A RESUME.
THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT I
WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH
HIM.
BUT IF HE SENSES WHAT'S GOING
ON, HE COULD PLAY HIS IDOL.
THIS IS GOING TO DETERMINE THE
COURSE OF THE GAME AND MY FUTURE
IN THE GAME.
SO IT'S A HUGE DECISION TONIGHT.
 I'M DECIDING WHETHER WE
SHOULD BE DANGEROUS TONIGHT OR
NOT.
THE CLOSER I GET IT TO, THE MORE
MY GUT IS TELLING ME THE STAY
WITH MALOLO FOR ONE MORE.
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A BETTER
CHANCE.
THE MORE I WEIGH IT, THE MORE I
KIND OF GET NERVOUS OF A MALOLO
GOING TONIGHT.
I JUST HAVE A GUT FEELING TODAY.
I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN
THIS GAME IF THERE'S TOO MUCH
NAVITI ON ONE SIDE, BUT IF I GO
AGAINST THEM AND IT DOESN'T WORK
OUT FOR US, NEXT TRIBAL PRETTY
MUCH PROBABLY PROBABLY BE ME.
 YOU THINK THAT'S THE BEST
WAY?
 THE PERSON I DO TRUST ALWAYS
HAS BEEN LAUREL, BUT IF I PULL
THIS OFF, IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE
BEST THINGS FOR MY GAME.
 SO IT'S LOOKING LIKE MICHAEL.
VOTE THE WAY THE MAJORITY IS
VOTING AND IT SHOWS YOU'RE ON
BOARD.
IT'S SMART THING TO DO.
 I TALKED TO DOM, AND THEY'RE
VOTING FOR MICHAEL SOME MY BACK
IS UP AGAINST THE WALL THINKING,
NOW I HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST MY
FORMER ALLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO
SAVE MYSELF.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: IT SUCKS BECAUSE I
HATE BEING THAT PERSON.
 WE HAVE FIVE RIGHT NOW, ALL
FIVE MALOLO.
THEY'RE SPLITTING THEIR VOTES ON
THE OTHER SIDE.
 WHO ARE THEY SPLITTING THE
VOTES FOR?
 BETWEEN YOU AND MIKE.
 DOM IS LIKE, LIBBY, YOU'RE
FINE.
AND DONATHAN TELLS ME THEY'RE
SPLITTING VOTES BETWEEN ME AND
MICHAEL.
WAIT, WHAT?
 I WANT THE KEEP THIS SIDE
TOGETHER FOR ONE MORE VOTE SO WE
CAN BE ON AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD.
 YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE TRYING THE STAY MALOLO
STRONG.
IF WE ALL VOTE TOGETHER, THIS
MIGHT BE THE START OF AN
ENTIRELY NEW GAME FOR ME, BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE
ANYMORE.
IT'S LIKE WHO DO YOU TRUST, WHO
DO YOU NOT TRUST, CAN WE STAY
MALOLO STRONG?
I'M REALLY TORN ABOUT WHAT TO DO
TONIGHT.
 I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
 THE ONLY PEOPLE I CAN'T READ
IS LAUREL AND DONATHAN.
 YEAH.
WE'LL FIND THAT TRUTH OUT
TONIGHT.
 GOING INTO TRIBAL, I HAVE
ERIC'S IDOL, AND HE MADE THE
MOST BONE-HEADED MOVE IN
"SURVIVOR" FANS VERSUS
FAVORITES.
I DON'T WANT ERIC'S CURSE TO
CONTINUE, BUT THE THING IS, IN
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR," I HAVE
TO BE WILLING TO TAKE RISK, SO I
AM TRYING TO NOT HAVE TO PLAY IT
TONIGHT.
YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY TRUST
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR ON THE
ISLAND.
YOU HAVE TO START REALLY
LISTENING TO THINGS AND CUES IN
TRIBAL.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A DANGER, BUT
HOPEFULLY I MAKE IT THROUGH
 Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT, ANGELA, LET'S START
WITH TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
YOU PHYSICALLY LOOKED LIKE A
DIFFERENT WOMAN TODAY.
AND THEN YOUR ACTIONS BACKED IT
UP.
WHAT HAPPENED?
 GOING INTO IT, JEFF, I WAS
SICK OF BEING ON THE BOTTOM.
I KEPT BEING LEFT OUT OF
CONVERSATION, NOT KNOWING THINGS
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE, SO I KNEW
I NEEDED TO WIN AND TAKE CONTROL
OF MY OWN GAME.
 Jeff: SEBASTIAN, ANGELA
TOOK A SEA SLUG AND JUST
SWALLOWED IT.
 IT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ON
HER PART.
I'M A SEAFOOD ENTREPRENEUR, AND
IT'S JUST IMPRESSIVE TO SEE A
WOMAN EAT A SEA SLUG BETTER THAN
I CAN.
[LAUGHTER]
 Jeff: DONATHAN, WHEN YOU
SEE AN EFFORT LIKE THAT, ARE YOU
FEELING THE GAME RATCHET UP IN
 YEAH, LIKE IN THESE PAST FEW
DAYS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOING OFF
AND DOING THEIR THING NOW.
ALLIANCES ARE BEING FORMED, AND
IT'S NOT MALOLO AND NAVITI
ANYMORE.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME.
 Jeff: DESIREE, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, OR ARE YOU STILL
FEELING THIS TUG, NAVITI,
MALOLO, SHOULD I BREAK APART?
ARE WE AT THAT POINT WHERE BIG
MOVES ARE REALLY BEING
CONSIDERED?
 IF YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING BIG
MOVES RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE NOT
PLAYING THE GAME.
IF THAT'S STAYING WITH NAVITI,
THEN THAT'S STAYING WITH NAVITI.
IF THAT'S GOING TO MALOLO, THEN
IT'S GOING TO MALOLO.
IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW IT BREX DOWN
FOR YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY.
 Jeff: DOMENICK, DOES THE
NEW FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL FORMAT
FAVOR PLAYERS WHO MAKE MOVES
VERSUS THE DO IT -- THE
COATTAILER, BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN
BRAG ABOUT YOUR GAME?
 ABSOLUTELY.
THE NEW TRIBAL FORMAT WILL ALLOW
PEOPLE TO COME OUT HERE AND TURN
ON THEIR BEST FRIEND AND THEN
HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THE
SITUATION TO THEM AT THE END AS
TO WHY THEY HAD TO DO IT.
 Jeff: WENDELL, IS THE RISK
THAT THE SAVVY COATTAILER WILL
SAY LET THE BIG LIONS EAT EACH
OTHER AND I'LL BE THE VULTURE
THAT COMES IN AND PICKS UP THE
SCRAPS.
 THAT'S A HUGE RISK.
YOU SEE THE BIGGEST GUY SITTING
ON THE JURY RIGHT.
NOW WHEN ONE BIG DOG IS GONE,
ANOTHER ONE SEEMS TO EMERGE, BUT
THEN HE BECOMES THE GUY PEOPLE
GO AFTER.
SO IT'S A HUGE RISK, YES.
 Jeff: MICHAEL, HOW MANY
MOVES DOWN THE ROAD ARE YOU
MAKING RIGHT NOW?
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE SO MANY
THAT YOU LOSE SIGHT OF TONIGHT.
 RIGHT.
FOR ME IT'S ALL ABOUT TONIGHT.
I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE GETTING TOO
COMFORTABLE OR AREN'T REALLY
CONSIDERING MAKING THE MOVES
EARLY ON THAT THEY MIGHT NEED
TO.
 Jeff: LAUREL, REALLY
INTERESTING COMMENT.
I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT BE GETTING
TOO COMFORTABLE.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, NAVITI STILL
HAS THE POWER, WHETHER THEY SAY
IT OR NOT, THERE'S STILL THIS
DIVIDE.
THAT'S WHAT US MALOLO CREW IS
TRYING TO TELL THEM.
THEY'RE NOT ALL ON THE.
TO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET
SOMEONE IN THE GROUP TO MAKE A
MOVE AND USE US WHILE WE'RE
STILL HERE.
 Jeff: CHELSEA, LAUREL IS
BASICALLY SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE
A PART OF A REAL MAJORITY, ARE
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT THE BOTTOM?
 HONESTLY, IF YOU'RE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE LINEUP, YOU'RE AN
IDIOT FOR STAYING WHERE YOU ARE,
BECAUSE CONGRATULATION, YOU FIND
YOURSELF ON THE JURY.
 Jeff: WENDELL, THE TRICK IS
TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY THEY'RE
ABOVE YOU.
 PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.
 Jeff: WHERE YOU JUST PREACH
WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE.
YOU'RE ALWAYS ON TOP.
YOU'RE FINE.
GO TO SLEEP.
 IT SOUNDS CULT-LIKE, JEFF.
IT ACTUALLY DOES.
 Jeff: AND YET, DOMENICK,
EVERYONE KNOWS THE LIE.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NO JOKE OUT HERE.
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY
CONVERSATIONS AS YOU WANT, BUT
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING B.S.ED,
AND ESPECIALLY AT THIS POINT IN
THE GAME, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IF
SOMEONE IS GOING TO JERUSALEM
SHIP -- JUMP SHIP AT ANY POINT.
 Jeff: KELLYN, WHY WOULD IT
MAKE SENSE FOR SOMEBODY TO JUMP
SHIP?
 NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE A BIG
JUMP, BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE
SOME MASTERFUL CONVINCING,
BECAUSE TO MAKE THE MOVE FROM
PURPLE TO ORANGE DOESN'T REALLY
MAKE SENSE.
BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL AT THE
BOTTOM.
SO IT'S TIME TO DRAW THE LINES
IN THE SAND, AND I THINK WE'RE
GOING TO LEARN MORE AFTER
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL THAN WE HAVE
ANY OTHER.
 Jeff: SO WHAT'S THE
CRITERIA FOR YOU TONIGHT,
MICHAEL?
WHAT'S THE MOVE?
 YOU KNOW, IT'S MAKING THE
RIGHT MOVE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE
NUMBERS, AND, YOU KNOW, IN OTHER
PEOPLE'S MINDS, MAYBE THAT'S THE
RIGHT TIME TO GET ME OUT,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS,
BUT I THINK THAT IT GOES BOTH
WAYS.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SIT ON A TIME
BOMB FOR TOO LONG AND IT MIGHT
BLOW UP RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.
I THINK THAT EVERYBODY REALLY
HAS TO THINK ABOUT THE MOVES
THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AND,
YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT WHEN IT'S
THE RIGHT TIME TO SEIZE THE
MOMENT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
DESIREE, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
THE ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.
MAYBE I'M BEING A LITTLE
PARANOID, BUT I'D SURE HATED TO
GO HOME WITH THIS THING IN MY
POCKET.
SO THIS WAS OZZY'S FAKE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL FROM "SURVIVOR"
BACK IN 2007.
THIS ONE IS FOR OZZY.
 Jeff: THIS IS NOT JUST A
STICK ANYMORE.
THIS IS A REAL IDOL.
ANY VETS CAST FOR MICHAEL WILL
NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE MICHAEL.
DOES NOT COUNT.
MICHAEL.
DOES NOT COUNT.
MICHAEL.
DOES NOT COUNT.
MICHAEL.

WENDELL.
THAT'S ONE VOTE WENDELL.
LIBBY.

LIBBY.
THAT'S TWO VOTES LIBBY.
ONE VOTE WENDELL.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
LIBBY.
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 BYE, LIBBY.
 SORRY, LIB.
 THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.
 WELL PLAYED, SIR.
 Jeff: LIBBY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 SEE YOU GUYS.
 BYE, LIB.
 Jeff: WELL, "SURVIVOR" IS
OFTEN COMPARED TO A ROLLER
COASTER RIDE.
25 DAYS IN, OUR SECOND MEMBER OF
THE JURY AND GHOST ISLAND STILL
IN PLAY, THIS RIDE IS FAR FROM
OVER.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THERE'S HOPE FOR
MALOLO.
 I'M READY TO TAKE OUT NAVITI.
 Jeff: WHEN THEY'RE GIVEN
THE AMMO.
 DES IS TRYING TO RALLY MALOLO
AGAINST YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: IT COULD BLOW THE
GAME WIDE OPEN.
 ONE OF THE MALOLO IS GOING
HOME.
 THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GO BUST
OUT HERE.
 FOR THE PAST THREE TRIBALS
I'VE RANDOMLY HAD MY NAME
WRITTEN DOWN, AND IT REALLY
SUCKS, BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO PUT
SOME TRUST IN PEOPLE.
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD.
I WON CHALLENGES.
I WON FOOD REWARDS, AND I MADE
ALLIANCES.
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF, AND I'M
GRATEFUL AND BLESSED FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE.
