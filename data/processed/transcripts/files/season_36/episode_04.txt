 --- 

        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE NAVITI TRIBE,
AN ALLIANCE BEGAN TO FORM
ACROSS OLD TRIBAL LINES.
SO IT'S YOU, ME, WENDELL.
FOR SURE.
AND DONATHAN.
Jeff: AND THEY HAD A CLEAR
TARGET.
IF IT WAS CHRIS RIGHT NOW, I
WOULD MAKE A MOVE ON HIM.
Jeff: THE MALOLO TRIBE WAS
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND THE
MINORITY ALLIANCE FELT DEFEATED.
WE'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT.
Jeff: UNTIL MICHAEL OFFERED
HOPE.








I JUST FOUND AN IDOL.
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY IS JAMES
WALKING OUT WITH TWO IDOLS.
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE TO END THAT
CURSE AND END THAT LEGACY AND
PLAY IT RIGHT THIS TIME.
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MICHAEL BLUFFED ABOUT THE POWER
OF THE IDOL.
THIS HAS DOUBLE POWER TO SAVE
TWO PEOPLE TONIGHT.
Jeff: AND PUT HIS PLAN IN
MOTION.
I CAN SAY THE FOUR OF US, ALL
OF OUR VOTES ARE GOING ON
BRADLEY, AND IF ANY OF YOU WOULD
LIKE TO JUMP, ALL IT TAKES IS
ONE VOTE.
Jeff: IN THE END, MICHAEL
MADE THE WRONG DECISION.








I'M GOING TO PLAY IT FOR
STEPH.
Jeff: AND WAS UNABLE TO
REVERSE THE IDOL'S CURSE.
BRENDAN.
SENDING HIS CLOSEST ALLY HOME.
BRENDAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
THANKS, JEFF.
Jeff: WELL, THAT WAS A
"SURVIVOR" SHOWDOWN.
NAVITI WON THIS ROUND, BUT THE
QUESTION IS: CAN THIS TRIBE
RECOVER SO YOU DON'T COME BACK
HERE AGAIN?
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
WHAT A NIGHT.
THAT WAS A CRAZY FIRST TRIBAL
COUNCIL FOR ME.
CRAZY, CRAZY TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO CONVINCED.
I WAS TOAST.
TONIGHT WAS A MASSIVE WAKE-UP
CALL.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING HOME.
I WAS SURE OF IT.
I THINK EVERYBODY WAS
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.
SOME OF US FIGHTING A LITTLE
MORE THAN OTHERS.
BUT I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI.
WITHOUT THEM STICKING TO THE
PLAN, I'D BE GONE.
GOOD LIE, MICHAEL.
THAT WAS REALLY ALL I GOT.
I APOLOGIZE IF I HURT ANYONE'S
FEELINGS, BUT I HOPE YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND FROM OUR POINT OF
VIEW, I WAS REALLY TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING I COULD.
I THINK MICHAEL OUTED HIMSELF
AS A HARD PLAYER.
UP UNTIL NOW, I JUST THOUGHT HE
WAS KIND OF THIS FRATTY BRO THAT
LIKED TO HANG OUT WITH JENNA AND
STEPHANIE.
I WAS DEAD WRONG ON THAT READ,
AND I THINK EVERY OTHER PERSON
ON ORIGINAL NAVITI NOW SEES
MICHAEL IS A HUGE THREAT.
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A COMPLETE
TOSS-UP.
IT WAS A REGULAR HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
IT COULD ONLY SAVE ONE PERSON,
AND THERE WERE FOUR OF US, SO
ANYWAY I PLAYED IT, IT WAS GOING
TO BE A COMPLETE SHOT IN THE
DARK.
I APPRECIATE YOU NOT BEING
SELFISH.
YOU COULD HAVE TOTALLY KEPT THAT
FOR YOURSELF.
YEAH.
THAT WAS BRAVE.
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE.
TRIBAL DIDN'T GO AS I HAD
HOPED.
I WAS DOING THE BEST I COULD TO
TRY SAVE ALL FOUR OF US BY LYING
ABOUT JAMES' IDOL.
IT WAS A GAMBLE.
FOR ME IN THIS GAME IT'S MY
FIRST HARD FALL.
I'M NOT SURE I'LL HAVE TRICK
UP MY SLEEVE, SO LET'S STAY
AWAY.
LET'S STAY AWAY.
I'M HOPING WE GET THE TRICK
UP OUR SLEEVE NEXT TIME.
I DON'T THINK THAT I REVERSED
ANY CURSE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T PLAY
THE IDOL RIGHT, AND I'M STILL
BEATING MYSELF UP FOR THAT, BUT
TRIBAL REALLY PROVED TO ME THAT
WE ARE THE THREE ON THE BOTTOM.
SO AFTER TONIGHT'S VOTE, I
DEFINITELY HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT
FOR ME.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
NAVITI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW MALOLO TRIBE.
BRENDAN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WOW.
WOW.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
YES.
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'RE GOING THE LEAP OVER A
SERIES OF TABLES.
YOU'LL THEN DISMANTLE A PILE OF
GIANT SANDBAGS, REVEALING A
LEVER.
YOU PULL THE WILL EVERY,
DROPPING 16 SMALLER SANDBAGS.
YOU'LL THEN WORK TOGETHER TO GET
THOSE SANDBAGS TO THE FINISH
WHERE YOU WILL USE THEM TO THROW
AT A SERIES OF TARGETS.
SPINNING THEM DOWN TO REVEL A
FLAG.
FIRST TRIBE TO POP ALL THREE
FLAGS WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
YEAH.
YES!
Jeff: IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE:
COFFEE AND PASTRIES.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
LET'S GO!
CINNAMON ROLLS.
Jeff: WOW, DOMENICK, THAT
IS A GIANT REACTION.
FOOD NS SCARCE.
WE HAVE FISHING GEAR, BUT WE'RE
REALLY STRUGGLING OUT HERE, SO
ANYTHING WE CAN GET IS HUGE.
Jeff: CLEARLY WORTH PLAYING
FOR.
IN ADDITION, THE WINNING TRIBE
WILL SEND SOMEBODY FROM THE
LOSING TRIBE TO GHOST ISLAND.
THIS SHOWDOWN CONTINUES.
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
UP AND OVER THE TABLE.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GO.
GOT TO GET EVERYBODY OVER.
COME ON, GUYS.
GET UP, GET UP, GET UP.
ALL RIGHT, MUSCLES, GO.
Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD, NAVITI.
MALOLO, YOU'RE GOOD.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO DISMANTLE THIS
PILE OF VERY HEAVY SANDBAGS.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT LEVER.
RIP 'EM OFF.
Jeff: THESE ARE NOT EASY TO
MOVE.
USE YOUR LEGS.
Jeff: COFFEE AND PASTRIES
ON THE LINE.
GHOST ISLAND AT STAKE.
MIDDLE.
THERE'S THE LEVER.
Jeff: MALOLO CAN SEE THE
LEVER.
WE'RE NECK AND NECK NOW.
GET THAT ARM READY, BABY.
GET READY THE PULL THAT THING
AND WE'RE RUNNING.
Jeff: ONCE THAT LEVER IS
FREE, PULL IT AND YOU'LL DROP
THOSE SANDBAGS.
MICHAEL GOT IT.
PULL!
YOU'RE GOOD.
LET'S GO.
IT IS NOW MALOLO IN THE LEAD.
NAVITI'S GOT IT.
YOU'RE GOOD.
NAVITI RIGHT BEHIND.
COME ON!
Jeff: TWO PEOPLE ARE
COLLECTING THE BAGS NOW.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS THROWING THEM.
THE BETTER SYSTEM YOU HAVE, THE
FASTER THIS IS GOING TO GO.
RIGHT NOW THIS IS JUST CHAOS.
SAPPED BAGS FLYING EVERYWHERE.
GOT TO GET 'EM ALL IN THE BIN.
ONCE YOU HAVE THEM ALL IN THE
BIN, YOU CAN START SHOOTING.
60 SANDBAGS TOTAL.
STEPHANIE AN JENNA FOR MALOLO,
CHRIS AND WENDELL FOR NAVITI.
GOT ALL OF THEM?
Jeff: NAVITI HAS THEIRS.
ONE MORE, JENNA.
Jeff: IT'S GOING TO BE
CHRIS THROWING FOR NAVITI.
HE'S ON TARGET OUT OF THE GATE.
GOT TO GET 'EM ALL IN THE BIN.
NOW YOU'RE GOOD, MALOLO.
IT IS SEBASTIAN THROWING FOR
MALOLO.
LET'S GO, C-BASS.
Jeff: CHRIS FOR NAVITI.
CHRIS CONNECTS AGAIN.
YOU HAVE TO HIT THE TARGET SO
THEY SPIN TO THE BOTTOM MAKING
THAT FLAG POP.
CHRIS POPS THE FIRST FLAG.
SUPER FAST.
RIGHT AWAY CHRIS IS ON FIRE FOR
NAVITI.
SEBASTIAN TRYING TO GET IN.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
SLOW AND STEADY, BABY.
YOU GOT IT.
Jeff: CHRIS, HE HAS GOT
SOME VELOCITY.
CHRIS POPS THE SECOND FLAG.
HE'S WORKING ON THE THIRD.
YOU GOT IT, CHRIS.
Jeff: CHRIS MAKING IT LOOK
EASY WHILE SEBASTIAN STRUGGLES.
IT IS AN AMAZING DISPLAY OF AN
ARM.
CHRIS IS MAKING THIS A BLOWOUT.
AND THIS IS IT.
IT IS OVER.
NAVITI WINS REWARD, COFFEE AND
PASTRIES IN A BLOWOUT THANKS TO
THE ARM.
IF THERE'S CHOCOLATE, I GET
IT.
Jeff: WOW.
SO CHRIS, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A
BACKGROUND IN SPORTS.
I DID USED TO TOSS THE ROCK A
LITTLE BACK IN MY PRIME.
Jeff: WHICH MEANS WHAT?
I USED TO PLAY BASEBALL BACK
IN COLLEGE, AND I PITCHED.
Jeff: NICE EFFORT.
THE RESULT IS A BLOWOUT FOR
NAVITI, AND IT RESULTS IN A NICE
REWARD, COFFEE AND PASTRIES
GOING BACK THE CAMP WITH YOU.
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE NOW SENDING
SOMEBODY FROM MALOLO TO GHOST
ISLAND.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SEND?
ROCKS?
ROCKS.
Jeff: INSTANT.
ROCKS IT IS.
DON'T LOOK.
THERE IS ONE WHITE ROCK.
WHITE GOES TO GHOST ISLAND.
SEBASTIAN GETS WHAT'S LEFT,
TRULY LEAVING IT UP TO CHANCE.
ALL RIGHT.
PUT YOUR PALMS OUT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
STEPHANIE HAS THE WHITE ROCK.
STEPHANIE, GRAB YOUR STUFF.
THE BOAT WILL TAKE YOU TO GHOST
ISLAND.
YOU WILL RETURN BACK TO YOUR
CAMP IN TIME FOR THE NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
GOOD-BYE, GUYS.
Jeff: NAVITI, NICE JOB.
COME GET YOUR REWARD.
ENJOY IT.
I CALLED THE CHOCOLATE.
Jeff: WELL EARNED.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
MALOLO, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
THIS WAS JUST ME BEING ME.
I GUESS IT'S FAIR TO SAY I WAS
PRETTY HOT TODAY.
I'M LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.
DO YOU SEE ME GLOW?
THIS AIN'T PAY-PER-VIEW.
IT'S A FREE SHOW.
I'M STILL SHOOTING THEM ALL DAY,
FREE THROW.
MIC DROP.
I ALMOST CRIED THAT I HAD TO
GO THE GHOST ISLAND.
RIGHT NOW I AM AT THE VERY
BOTTOM WITH MICHAEL AND JENNA IN
OUR MALOLO TRIBE.
THAT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BEING
OUT HERE AND BEING SEGREGATED
FROM MY GROUP.
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR," 24 HOURS
CAN MEAN EVERYTHING.
HOWEVER, I TRULY BELIEVE
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
HERE WE GO.
AND MIGUEL ON GHOST ISLAND IS TO
TWIST THIS GAME AROUND AND
HOPEFULLY GET AN ADVANTAGE.
THERE WE GO.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
WHAT?
NOPE, NOT TODAY?
NO GAME FOR ME?
DAMMIT, I NEEDED IT.
DAMMIT.
WHEN I GOT THE MESSAGE THAT I'M
NOT PLAYING A GAME OUT HERE, I'M
GOING TO BE HONEST, MY HEART
SUNK QUITE A BIT.
BUT WHEN I HAVE MOMENTS, WHEN IT
HAVE TO BE BRAVE AND I CAN SHOW
MY KIDS IN THE WORLD THAT I CAN
DO EVERYTHING ALONE, THOSE ARE
THE MOMENTS WHEN I TAKE A DEEP
BREATH AND SOAK IN THE STRENGTH
THAT I DO HAVE, BECAUSE I FIFTH
AMENDMENT UNHAPPY BEFORE IN
LIFE, AND THAT'S WHY I LEFT THE
MORMON RELIGION AND GOT DIVORCED
ALL IN THE SPAN OF SIX MONTHS.
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED MY TRUE
INNER STRENGTH AND THAT I
BELIEVE IN MYSELF REGARDLESS OF
IF ANYBODY ELSE DOES.
AND THAT'S TRUE STRENGTH IN
LIFE.
NOW, AS A SINGLE MOM, I ONLY
HAVE MYSELF TO RELY ON, AND I
WANT TO CHANNEL THAT INNER
STRENGTH, BECAUSE I'M READY TO
GO BACK OUT THERE AND KICK SOME
ASS WITH CLEAR VISION AND A
CLEAR MIND.
YOU ALL READY TO ROCK OR
WHAT?
YES.
I WOULD LIKE THE CHOCOLATE,
BUT IF PEOPLE WANT TO SPLIT IT,
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT,
TOO.
LET'S PUT IT IN REAL QUICK.
THREE-PEAT ON THREE, ONE, TWO,
THREE...
THREE-PEAT!
CHRIS SCORED THAT BIG WIN.
WE HAVE NOW WON
BACK-TO-BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.
DIG IN, GUYS.
THEY MUST BE CRUSHED RIGHT
NOW.
CRUSHED.
HE'S A PHYSICAL ASSET, PLUS
CHRIS HAS SHOWN A MUCH BIGGER
WILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY WORK
WITH US MALOLO BEFORE.
SO HAVING CHRIS ON OUR SIDE
MEANS THAT BASICALLY NOW WE ARE
THE ONES CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.
FIRST CUP.
OH, MAN.
MY GOD.
SOME MUSCLE OVER HERE.
WE DID OUR JOB, LET'S ENJOY THE
AFTERNOON COFFEE.
YEAH.
AT FIRST I WAS ECSTATIC THAT
WE WON, BUT THEN THOSE ITEMS
MADE ME REALLY THINK OF HOME.
IT REMINDED ME OF MY MOM AN MY
GRANDMOTHER.
YOU WANT COMPANY?
YEAH, YOU CAN SIT DOWN.
OKAY.
I'M NOT SURE.
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I LOVE IT.
THAT COFFEE AND THE STUFF
REALLY HIT HOME TODAY.
YEAH?
IT'S LIKE HOME FOR ME.
I ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF MY
GRANDMOTHER.
SHE HAD TWO STROKES.
AND I JUST HAD THAT ON MY MIND
TODAY.
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
COMING OUT HERE.
WHY?
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S MORE ON
MY MOM.
IMAGINE SITTING ON THE COUCH
WATCHING THIS, THOUGH.
I KNOW.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO PROUD
OF YOU.
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW IS MY
GRANDMOTHER.
SHE'S BEEN SICK.
MY MOTHER AS WELL IS DISABLED,
SO BEING OUT HERE, YOU KIND OF
FEEL GUILTY IN A WAY.
I DID LEAVE THEM.
I KNOW IT'S A LOT ON MY MOM.
A LOT OF MY FAMILY DON'T WANT TO
PITCH IN AND HELP.
I'M NOT A COFFEE DRINKER, BUT
KNOWING THAT'S WHAT THEY ENJOY,
HAVING THAT LITTLE BIT OF HOME.
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD ABOUT
THAT.
I TRUST YOU ENOUGH TO TELL
YOU.
OH, MY GOSH, YEAH.
I COULD SEE DONATHAN WAS A
LITTLE UPSET, SO I SAW THAT AS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT TO
HIM, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE
PROBABLY TALKED THE LEAST OUT OF
THE FOUR MALOLOS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN, I KNOW
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING GOING ON.
THIS IS REALLY THE ONLY MOMENT
WE HAD TOGETHER.
IT'S ROUGH.
THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE EVER
BEEN WITHOUT MY MOM AND MY
FAMILY.
MY MOM'S IN AN ASSISTED
LIVING HOME, BEEN IN THERE FOR
LIKE SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS, SO I'VE
HAD TO GO DOWN THERE, YOU KNOW,
TAKE CARE OF HER.
WHEN I WAS 15, I WAS FEEDING HER
MEDICATIONS, CARRYING HER TO THE
BATHROOM.
YOU WANT TO BE A TEENAGER.
YOU WANT TO BE A YOUNG ADULT,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE
TO SACRIFICE CERTAIN THINGS TO
TAKE CARE OF THE LOVED ONE THAT
TOOK CARE OF YOU.
I WAS TELLING HIM ABOUT MY MOM,
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT WAS A
GOOD WAY TO RELATE AND TO
CONNECT AND BUILD TRUE
RELATIONSHIPS AND BONDS, YOU
KNOW, AS A KID I DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT AS A
CHILD.
IT'S FRUSTRATING AND IT WAS
TOUGH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE MINUTE MY MOM
WAS TOLD SHE HAD TWO MONTHS TO
LIVE, I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT
DAY, I WAS 17.
I TOLD MYSELF I HAD TO BECOME A
BETTER MAN.
TO HEAR HIS STORY OF HIM
HAVING TO STEPH UP TO THE PLATE
KIND OF LIKE I DID, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT RELATE TO
THAT AND HAVE A HEART FOR IT.
I'VE LIVED IT MYSELF.
IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE AND
SACRIFICE TO SACRIFICE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT.
LAUREL IS REALLY WANTING TO
WORK WITH WENDELL TO GET OUT
CHRIS.
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR LAUREL,
BUT I HAVE DEFINITELY BONDED
CLOSER WITH CHRIS.
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE HERE
BEING PULLED BACK AND FORTH.
I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT'S
BEST FOR ME.
THIS IS THE TIME I HAVE TO START
THINKING ABOUT DONATHAN.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
WE'LL NOW BRING IN STEPHANIE
RETURNING FROM GHOST ISLAND.
HI, FAMILY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
THERE YOU GO.
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE OUT ACROSS A
FLOATING BRING CARRYING A BODY
BOARD ATTACHED TO A ROPE.
YOU'LL GRAB A BAG AND THEN HANG
ON AS THE REST OF YOUR TRIBE
WILL CRANK A GIANT WHEEL,
PULLING YOU BACK TO SHORE.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS,
YOU'LL USE THE NUMBERED TILES
INSIDE TO SOLVE A COMBINATION
LOCK RELEASING A KEY.
YOU'LL USE THAT KEY TO UNLOCK A
SLIDE PUZZLE.
FIRST TRIBE THE FINISH THEIR
PUZZLE WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
YOU'LL -- WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HOAR WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
GO, WENDELL.
Jeff: IT'S WENDELL FOR
NAVITI, CHELSEA FOR MALOLO.
YOU'RE GOING THE RACE OUT WITH
THAT BODY BOARD.
GOT TO DO SOME ROPE MANAGEMENT.
WAY TO GO, WENDELL.
KEEP IT UP.
LET'S GO, CHELSEA.
YOU GOT IT, CHELS.
Jeff: YOUR JOB IS TO GET IT
OUT, AND YOUR TRIBE IS GOING TO
PULL YOU BACK.
WENDELL IN THE EARLY LEAD, BUT
CHELSEA RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.
YOU GOT THIS, CHELS.
Jeff: WENDELL UNTYING HIS
BAG.
YEAH, WENDELL.
Jeff: HE'S GOT IT.
YOU'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."
ING NOW.
WENDELL IN THE WATER.
HE'S READY TO GO.
NAVITI STARTS TO CRANK.
THERE GOES WENDELL.
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT.
GO, GO, GO!
Jeff: WENDELL IS NOW BACK.
CHELSEA'S GOT HER BAG.
SHE'S IN THE WATER.
MALOLO STARTING TO CRANK.
THAT THERE GOES CHELSEA.
LET'S GOSH, CHELSEA.
Jeff: WENDELL RACING BACK
WITH FIRST BAG FOR NAVITI.
GO, NAVITI.
CHELSEA'S BACK.
LET'S GO, CHELS.
Jeff: GO, MALOLO.
HERE COMES DESIREE.
NAVITI WITH A QUICK LEAD.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
Jeff: GO, LIB.
Jeff: NOW LIBBY IS SLOWING
DOWN ON THE BRIDGE.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR MALOLO.
KEEP IT UP, GUYS.
Jeff: DESIREE IS WHIPPING
ACROSS THIS BRIDGE NOW.
LIBBY HAS BLOWN THE LEAD THAT
NAVITI HAD OUT OF THE GATE.
BOTH WOMEN GET BACK ABOUT THE
SAME TIME.
BOTH START UNTYING.
NAVITI AND MALOLO READY TO PULL.
HOLD ON TIGHT, LIBBY.
Jeff: LIBBY NOW IS IN THE
WATER.
SHE'S BACK IN THE LEAD.
NAVITI STARTS PULLING HER.
YOU GOT THIS, DES.
Jeff: DESIREE LOSES THE
BOARD.
SHE'S UNDER WATER.
COME ON, BABY.
Jeff: IS SHE ON THERE?
CAN SHE HANG ON UNDERWATER?
WOW!
LIB OWE'S BACK.
DESIREE HANGING ON.
THAT IS THE "SURVIVOR" RIDE
RIGHT THERE.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW
IN, IN CHALLENGE.
GO, WENDELL.
WENDELL BACK IN THE WATER FOR
NAVITI.
DESIREE, GO, IT'S GOING TO BE
CHELSEA AGAIN.
WENDELL MAKES HIS SECOND RUN.
CHELSEA MAKES HER SECOND RUN.
BOTH PEOPLE ARE NOW WINGSDED.
KEEP IT UP, CHELSEA.
YOU GOT IN, CHELS.
KEEP IT UP, WEB WENDELL.
YOU'RE GOOD.
Jeff: WENDELL'S BACK
UNTYING THIS THIRD BAG.
I GOT THIS GUYS, DON'T WORRY.
Jeff: CHELSEA SLOWING DOWN.
CHELSEA NOW FALLS IN.
THAT IS AN OPENING FOR NAVITI.
WENDELL'S GOT IT.
AND CHELSEA'S BACK UP.
EVERYTHING YOU GOT.
Jeff: WENDELL'S READY.
NAVITI STARTS PULLING.
NOW.
PULL, PULL!
Jeff: JAMES, DOMENICK AND
CHRIS AND LAUREL DOING A GREAT
JOB.
WENDELL'S NOW BACK WITH THAT
THIRD BAG.
GO, NAVITI.
THEY CAN START WORKING ON THEIR
COMBINATION LOCK NOW.
LET'S GO, CHELSEA!
Jeff: CHELSEA'S GOT HER
BAG.
SHE'S IN THE WATER.
GO, GO!
Jeff: CHELSEA'S IN THE
WATER NOW.
SHE'S GETTING PULLED SIDEWAYS.
SHE'S UPSIDE DOWN AND LOSES THE
BOARD.
STOP.
Jeff: ANOTHER SETBACK FOR
MALOLO.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, CHELSEA.
Jeff: JAMES AND DOMENICK
WORKING ON THAT COMBINATION
LOCK.
YOU GOT THIS.
COME ON.
Jeff: NAVITI WITH A HUGE
LEAD RIGHT NOW.
COME ON, CHELSEA, KEEP IT UP.
Jeff: CHELSEA'S BACK!
CHELSEA'S GOT SOME TIME TO MAKE
UP.
DOMENICK AND JAMES STILL WORKING
ON THAT COMBINATION LOCK.
BIG TIME ADVANTAGE, BUT THEY
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
CAPITALIZE.
IT IS KELLYN AND BRADLEY QUICKLY
WORKING TO CATCH UP.
HUGE EFFORT FROM BOTH TRIBES SO
FAR.
27-36...
Jeff: DOMENICK AND JAMES,
THERE THEY GO.
DOMENICK AND JAMES HAVE IT.
THEY CAN UNLOCK THE SLIDE
PUZZLE.
NAVITI HAS A KEY.
THEY HAVE TO GET THAT LOCK OPEN.
THEY'VE GOT IT.
THEY CAN START WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLE.
36-27-18.
Jeff: GET THAT N UP THERE.
Jeff: KELLYN AND BRADLEY
HAVE THE COMBINATION SOLVED.
GHOST ISLAND, GHOST ISLAND.
Jeff: IT WOULD BE A BIG
COMEBACK FOR MALOLO AFTER A BIG
SETBACK ON THE BODY BOARD.
YES, YES.
YES!
Jeff: THEY CAN START
WORKING ON THEIR PUZZLE.
ONCE AGAIN WE'RE BACK EVEN.
BRADLEY AND KELLYN, JAMES AND
DOMENICK, SIDE BY SIDE, FOR
IMMUNITY.
BRING THE N OVER.
Jeff: SLIDE PUZZLES ARE
NOTORIOUS FOR LOOKING LIKE
YOU'RE CLOSE, BUT AS IN
"SURVIVOR" FAN KNOWS, A PUZZLE
IS NOT OVER UNTIL EVERY PIECE IS
IN ITS PLACE.
YOU GUYS GOT IT.
LET'S GO.
PULL THOSE DOWN.
SLIDE 'EM DOWN NICE AND EASY.
GOT TO GET THAT H OVER, GUYS.
Jeff: BRADLEY AND KELLYN
NOT PANICKING.
THAT'S ALL THE WAY AT THE
END.
THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY AND
METHODICALLY.
KEEP THAT O IN THERE.
KEEP THAT O UP.
BRING THE A UP SO YOU CAN
BRING THE D OVER.
Jeff: A LOT OFEN JOY ON
NAVITI.
DOMENICK SEEMS TO HAVE A FLOW
GOING, BARKING OUT ORDERS, BUT
JAMES THINKS HE KNOWS BETTER.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
GET THE I UP, GUYS.
NICE, NICE.
Jeff: BRADLEY AND KELLYN
STARTING TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS.
WE JUST NEED ONE OF THE Ss.
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
GET THE N DOWN.
Jeff: NAVITI REALLY GETTING
IN ON IT.
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE CLOSE.
THERE IT IS!
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT IT.
SLAM IT.
Jeff: NAVITI DOES.
NAVITI WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
MALOLO BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WE DID IT.
WE GOT THE PUZZLE!
OH, MY GOD!
Jeff: NAVITI, ONCE AGAIN
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NAVITI, NO
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
KELLYN, IF IT'S ANYTHING, YOU
ARE EXPRESSIVE.
YOU CAN TELL HOW YOU'RE FEELING
JUST BY LOOKING AT YOU.
YOUR HEAD HAS BEEN DOWN SINCE
THE MOMENT YOU LOST.
JEFF, I FEEL LIKE I REALLY
LET EVERYONE DOWN THAT'S
STANDING AROUND ME, AND I JUST
WISH I COULD HAVE PULLED IT OUT
AND IT'S JUST NOT WHAT WE WANTED
TO DO TO GO BACK TO TRIBAL
TONIGHT, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
"SURVIVOR."
Jeff: AND YET MICHAEL,
DECEMBER POINTS NAVITI PEOPLE
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
LOSS, LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE, IS
IT GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MALOLO
TONIGHT?
DO YOU THINK YOU, STEPHANIE, AND
JENNA ARE THE ONES IN TROUBLE?
SURE, YEAH.
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT REALLY A LOT
OF HOPE FOR US.
I'D LOVE TO STAY AS STRONG AS WE
CAN, BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS
TWO OF US ARE GOING TO COME OUT
OF TRIBAL TONIGHT STILL IN THE
GAME AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TODAY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MALOLO,
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE FIFTH PERSON VOTED
OUT OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."
LOSING TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, I FELT REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF THAT I
COULDN'T PULL IT OUT FOR THE
TEAM, BUT UNLESS THE ORIGINAL
MALOLO PULL SOME SORT OF TRICK
OUT OF THEIR BAG LIKE THEY DID
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, EITHER
STEPHANIE, MICHAEL OR JENNA ARE
GOING HOME.
I HATE LOSE, YOU GUYS.
I DO, TOO.
I DO, TOO.
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY
EASIER.
NO.
LOSING THIS IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE TODAY IS DEVASTATING.
I'M DEFINITELY BACKED INTO A
COORNER RIGHT NOW.
I'M ONE OF THREE OPTIONS
ESSENTIALLY OF WHO GOES HOME
TONIGHT.
I THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO BE AN
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S EVERY
MAN FOR THEMSELVES.
I REALLY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE
STEPH OR JENNA GO, BUT I'M
PREPARED TO WRITE DOWN EITHER OF
THEIR NAMES TONIGHT.
I WAS THINKING JENNA.
I'D LIKE THE SPLIT UP THOSE TWO
GIRLS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS RIGHT?
I'M OKAY.
THAT WOULD BE MY VOTE.
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD ARGUMENT TO
ME.
GOING TO TRIBAL IS GOING TO
BE MISERABLE.
UH-HUH.
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE
FIVE NAVITI HAVE CONTROL OF THE
GAME.
THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO BUDGE.
THEY'RE ALL JUST PLAYING IT
SAFE.
SO IT'S 100% A INDIVIDUAL GAME
AT THIS POINT.
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OF
A STRATEGY BEST FOR MYSELF.
THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO BE
LIKABLE.
YOU HAVE TO BE -- PEOPLE HAVE TO
WANT TO BE AROUND YOU, SO I'VE
BEEN TRYING MY BEST, BUT
UNFORTUNATELY I ALWAYS HAVE THIS
BLANK ALMOST ANGRY LOOK ON MY
FACE, SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
SWITCH OFF THE DEFENSIVE BITCHY
LOOK.
THAT'S WHERE I GO.
DOES YOUR HAIR STILL SMELL
GOOD?
THE FAINTEST BIT OF GOOD.
UH, LIKE DEAD WEASEL.
SO I WANT THE TRY TO WORK MY
WAY IN WITH SEBASTIAN.
I NEED TO PUT MY LITTLE WALL
ASIDE.
I'M HOPING THAT IT WILL PROTECT
ME.
WANT ME TO BRAID YOUR HAIR?
YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BRAID HAIR.
I BRAID HAIR IN THE CRAZIEST
BRAIDS YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
B.S.
I'LL MOVE IT TO YOU.
JENNA IS IN A TOUGH SPOT, AND
I NEED BRAIDERS IN THIS TRIBE OR
I'LL BE A SINGLE DREAD INSTEAD
OF ONE TINY DREAD.
SO AS LONG AS SHE KEEPS FLIRTING
WITH ME, THAT'S COOL, I'M NOT
OPPOSED TO HER STAYING IN THIS
GAME.
SHE'S MORE STRATEGIC.
BUT SHE'S ACTUALLY PLAYING
THE GAME.
JENNA IS NOT REALLY PLAYING.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
WHATEVER Y'ALL FEEL.
I THINK WE GOT TO PUT STEPH
UP.
EVERYBODY HAD CHANGED THEIR
MIND.
THEY THINK WE NEED TO VOTE FOR
STEPHANIE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
IT.
BUT IF EVERYONE WANTS TO SWITCH
TO STEPHANIE, I'LL SWITCH.
I KNOW I TURNED INTO A CRAZY
PERSON, BUT IF YOU KEEP ME
AROUND AND USE ME, AND I KNOW
THE NUMBERS.
I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT IF YOU
CAN --
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
I'LL MEAN IT, BECAUSE I WOULD
LIKE THE PLAY THIS GAME WITH
YOU.
I'M SORRY.
PIN SOMEBODY ELSE THIS TIME.
I'M SORRY.
WITH BRADLEY, I JUST HAVE TO
SUCK IT UP AND SMILE AND BAT MY
EYES AT HIM, BECAUSE GETTING TO
THE END IN THIS GAME IS
EVERYTHING TO ME.
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN THAT I'M
SUPPORTING.
I HAVE BEEN ENVISIONING GETTING
THAT $1 MILLION CHECK AT THE
REUNION CHECK AND JUST RUNNING
DOWN AND PICKING MY KIDS UP AND
THEN SCREAMING BECAUSE THEIR MOM
JUST WON "SURVIVOR."
IT BLOWS MY MIND THINKING ABOUT
THAT MOMENT, BECAUSE I'M ONLY 25
DAYS FROM IT, AND I'M SO CLOSE
AND I WANT IT SO BAD FOR ALL OF
US.
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP MY HEAD IN
THE GAME.
I THINK YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM
AT ALL.
NO.
HE'S SMART.
AND YOU ALSO CAN'T TRUST
STEPHANIE, BUT JENNA IS
PRACTICALLY HARMLESS AND WILL DO
WHATEVER SEBASTIAN SAYS.
MICHAEL.
I'M HELPLESS TONIGHT.
IF YOU WANT ME OUT.
I'M GONE.
IF YOU SEE THE VALUE IN KEEPING
ME, I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO
IT, THEN...
WE CAN'T KEEP LOSING.
RIGHT.
EVEN IF IT'S JUST KEEPING ME
ASH FOR THE CHALLENGES AND IF I
HAVEN'T PROVEN MY LOYALTY, THEN
VOTE ME OUT.
BUT I'M GOING THE PROVE MY
LOYALTY, AND I'LL WIN SOME
CHALLENGES, SO I THINK IT'S A
WIN-WIN.
I THINK SO.
YOU UNDERSTAND I FEEL LIKE --
 I'M ON THE SAME PAGE WITH
YOU.
FOR SURE.
BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU, MAN,
I'M LOCKED AND LOYAL.
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN TO
SMOOTH THINGS OVER, ESPECIALLY
TOWARD BRADLEY, BUT YOU NEVER
REALLY TRULY KNOW WHAT ANYBODY
IS THINKING.
I MIGHT NOT EVEN STAND A CHANCE.
I'VE GIVEN, YOU KNOW, MY BEST
AND SOME.
I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME I'VE
BEEN WAITING TO PLAY FOR TEN
YEARS.
AND I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF
I DIDN'T TRY MY HARDEST.
YOU KNOW, I AM ONLY 18, AND THIS
GAME, IT'S THE BEST EXPERIENCE
IN MY LIFE SO FAR.
AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES SEEM
LIKE MY OPTIONS ARE VERY
LIMITED, IT'S HARD.
IT'S FRUSTRATING.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN INDEPENDENT
PERSON, AND SOMEBODY THAT WANTED
FOR FOR MYSELF.
TO MOVE AWAY FROM MY FAMILY AT A
YOUNG AGE AND TO COME OUT HERE
AND PLAY, YOU KNOW, THIS CRAZY
GAME, FOR ME I JUST WANT TO
ACCOMPLISH THINGS AS YOUNG AS I
CAN AND I REALLY WANT IT.
WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES, BUT WE
HAVE TO DECIDE FAST.
IS THAT WHAT WE WANT?
STEPHANIE IS THE BIGGEST RISK
TO VOTE FOR, BECAUSE SHE WENT TO
GHOST ISLAND AND MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR,
MICHAEL?
JENNA?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON
GHOST ISLAND WHILE STEPHANIE WAS
THERE, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE
COULD HAVE.
BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK
NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED, BECAUSE
I LOOKED THROUGH HER BAG, AND
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER BAG.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE COULD
HAVE PUT IT, BUT SHE MAY HAVE
GOT THAT ADVANTAGE.
I'M NOT SURE.
YOU SURE?
YEP.
AS WE GO INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT, THERE'S 100 DIFFERENT
VARIABLES THAT GO THROUGH YOUR
HEAD, AND SO YOU HAVE TO WEIGH
WHICH PERSON YOU CAN TRUST THE
MOST, WHICH PERSON YOU THINK IS
THE MOST DANGEROUS, AND WHO IS
THE LEAST THREAT TO MY OWN GAME.
BUT FORTUNATELY FOR US, WE'VE
GOT THE NUMBERS.
WE ARE IN CONTROL, AND WE'RE
GOING TO CALL THE SHOTS.
Jeff: SO KELLYN, WHEN WE
LEFT THE CHALLENGE, IT SEEMED
PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT WAS EITHER
GOING TO BE STEPHANIE, JENNA, OR
MICHAEL GOING HOME TONIGHT.
IS THAT STILL THE FEELING?
YEAH.
IT WAS A BUSY AFTERNOON, AND TO
SAY THAT WE'VE HAD THE SAME IDEA
FOR THE SAME PERSON ALL DAY
WOULD NOT WITH THE TRUTH.
AND I THINK THAT IS THE BEAUTY
OF "SURVIVOR" AND THEN ALSO WHAT
MAKES IT SO PAINFUL FOR THE
PERSON WHO'S OR TORCH GETS SNUFF
BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE
SENTENCE THAT ONE OF US SAID
THAT CHANGED OUR COLLECTIVE, AND
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE TONIGHT.
Jeff: MAN, I'M LOOKING AT
THE THREE FACES HEARING THAT.
STEPHANIE, ONE SENTENCE.
ONE COMMENT COULD BE THE
DIFFERENCE.
IT KIND OF IS A HELPLESS
FEELING.
I WAS ON GHOST ISLAND, SO THAT
SCARES ME OF WHAT DID I MISS
WHILE I WAS GONE, BECAUSE A LOT
CAN HAPPEN IN ONE NIGHT WHEN
YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR TRIBE.
Jeff: BRADLEY, WAS THERE
ANY CONCERN THAT STEPHANIE'S
VISIT TO GHEsá ISLAND
RESULTEDDED IN SOMETHING THAT
COULD CHANGE THE VOTE TONIGHT?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO BE
CONCERNED AT ALL.
DID SHE PLAY THE GAME, DIDN'T
SHE PLAY THE GAME?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THE WAY YOU HAVE TO OPERATE
GOING INTO TONIGHT'S VOTE IS
THAT SHE POTENTIALLY GOT AN
ADVANTAGE.
Jeff: SO DOES THAT HELP
YOU, STEPHANIE, OR DOES IT HURT
YOU IF THEY THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
AN ADVANTAGE?
THAT COULD GO BOTH WAYS
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ADVANTAGE
IS IF I PLAYED.
THERE'S A LOT OF IFS IN THERE.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, ONE OF THE
TOUGH THINGS ABOUT "SURVIVOR" IS
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
TRUTH IS UNTIL IT'S FINALLY
REVEALED.
YEAH.
YOU REALLY CAN'T GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF IT.
LIKE WE LEARNED LAST TRIBAL, BUT
RIGHT NOW IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE,
JEFF.
WE GOT TO GET RID OF THE LAST
THREE OF OUR NON-ALLIANCE.
CAN I CHIME IN?
I THINK THAT WHEN THE MERGE
COMES, YOU WANT TO HAVE THE UP
SIDE OF THE NUMBERS.
THE WAY I SEE THAT HAPPENING IS
WINNING THESE NEXT SEVERAL
CHALLENGES, AND I WOULD BE YOUR
BEST BET WINNING THOSE
CHALLENGES AND MAKING IT TO THE
MERGE WITH THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
NUMBERS.
KELLYN, WHAT MICHAEL I THINK
IS POINTING OUT, IF THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO IS WIN THE
5-3, YOU'VE WON.
BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO
THE END AND YOU CONTINUE TO VOTE
OUT STRONG PEOPLE, IS THAT THE
MOVE OF A SMART FIVE?
IT DOES FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON A
BIT OF A SNOWBALL DOWNHILL AS
CHALLENGES GO, BUT THERE ARE SO
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT
WHAT STRENGTH IS IN THIS GAME.
Jeff: BRADLEY, KELLYN SAYS
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK
AT STRENGTH.
MICHAEL CERTAINLY DISPLAYED SOME
STRATEGIC ABILITY AT THE LAST
TRIBAL, WHICH HAS TOçó PUT YOU A
LITTLE ON EDGE.
ABSOLUTELY.
I WALKED INTO LAST TRIBAL AND I
DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE AN INCH
FROM MY "SURVIVOR" LIFE.
THERE WAS A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME I
THOUGHT I WAS GOING HOME SOME
IT'S A FAIR ARGUEMENT TO SAY
AFTER WHAT HE PULLED AT THE LAST
TRIBAL, ESPECIALLY TOWARD ME,
THAT THE FIRST THING I WANT TO
DO IS TO GET RID OF HIM
IMMEDIATELY.
LOOK.
MY ALLIANCE WITH JENNA, STEPH,
AND BRENDAN WAS REAL, AND I WAS
DOING EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY
COULD, UTILIZING THE IDOL I HAD
FOUND, TELLING A FEW LIES IN THE
PROCESS TO TRY TO GET MY
ALLIANCE TO WHERE WE NEEDED TO
GO.
NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE, BUT
I'M LOOKING TO SHOW YOU GUYS THE
SAME KIND OF RESPECTED THAT I
DID MY ORIGINAL ALLIANCE.
Jeff: SO STEPHANIE, IF IT'S
ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU, WHAT IS
THIS "SURVIVOR" JOURNEY ABOUT?
WHY DO YOU NEED TO STAY?
I WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE
THIS IS MY DREAM, AND I'VE BEEN
WANTING TO LIVE THIS OUT FOR SO
MANY YEARS.
EVERY TIME WE COME TO TRIBAL,
WHICH HAS BEEN QUITE A BIT, IT
GETS HARDER, BECAUSE YOU'RE
WITHIN GRASP OF THAT BEING TAKEN
AWAY FROM YOU, AND I JUST WANT
TO KEEP ON HAVING OPPORTUNITIES
TO GROW IN THIS GAME PERSONALLY
AND TO EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE
BEEN WATCHING FOR ALL THESE
YEARS.
Jeff: AND IF IT'S OVER,
WHAT ABOUT THIS WILL BE
UNFULFILLED?
THAT QUESTION HITS ME TO THE
CORE, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M
PLAYING THIS FOR MY KIDS, AND
THIS IS MY GAME AND THIS IS MY
TIME, BUT THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO MY
HEART, AND I DON'T HAVE FEAR OF
LETTING ANYBODY ELSE DOWN IN
LIFE EXCEPT FOR THEM.
BUT I'M NOT READY TO GO.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE SOME OF THESE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I'VE BEEN
BUILDING WITH MALOLO AN WITH
NAVITI ARE VERY REAL, AND
THERE'S A LOT OF GAME LEFT, AND
I HAVE A LOT OF GAME LEFT IN ME.
Jeff: JENNA, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK DREW YOU TO
"SURVIVOR"?
FOR ME, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD
THIS FRONT UP.
I ALWAYS PUT UP THIS FACE LIKE I
DON'T WANT TO BE APPROACHED.
I DON'T WANT TO BE VULNERABLE.
I DON'T WANT THE LET PEOPLE IN
WHEN I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO VOTE ME OUT.
THAT'S ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY
HEAD.
IT'S HARD BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE
RELATIONSHIPS.
I'M TRYING MY HARDEST.
I KNOW I'VE COME A LONG WAY.
THIS GAME WILL FORCE ME TO COME
OUT OF THE SHELL EVEN MORE, BUT
MOVING FORWARD, I HOPE I DON'T
FIT THE CATEGORY OF WHAT THEY'RE
LOOKING TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, WHEN YOU
TAKE AWAY THE PURPLE COLOR AND
ORANGE, JUST LISTEN TO JENNA
SPEAK, SHE'S TRYING TO GET
BETTER AT RELATIONSHIPS AND
SHE'S PICKED THE MOST DIFFICULT
GAME.
IT'S GOT TO BE HARD TO WRITE
JENNA'S NAME DOWN.
IT CRUSHES ME TO WRITE
ANYONE'S NAME DOWN.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE ANGLES
FOR EVERYTHING.
Jeff: MICHAEL, WHAT DOES
"SURVIVOR" REPRESENT TO YOU?
"SURVIVOR" IS A LIFE LONG
FANDOM FOR ME.
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE WATCHED
SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.
EVERYBODY COMES OUT HERE
PICTURES THEIR PERFECT GAME AND
THEN GETTING TO THE END.
TO HAVE MY GAME GO DIFFERENTLY
THAN I EXPECTED IS REALLY HARD.
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO CONVEY THAT I AM BEING
AUTHENTIC, AND I'M PLAYING THE
BEST GAME THAT I CAN AND TRYING
TO SHOW EVERYBODY LOYALTY AND GO
FAR IN THIS GAME.
Jeff: DES, WAS THERE A
CLEAR PURPOSE AMONG THE NAVITI
FIVE OF WHO TO TAKE OUT AND THE
REASON WHY TO TAKE THEM OUT?
DEFINITELY.
THERE'S ALWAYS A GOOD REASON TO
TAKE OUT SOMEONE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THE
REASON.
AND I THINK TONIGHT WE FOUND THE
REASON TO TAKE OUT ONE OF THE
THREE.
AND IT'S A GOOD REASON.
AND IT WILL SHOW IN THE FUTURE.
Jeff: OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CHELSEA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DESIREE.
STEPH.
STEPH.
THAT'S TWO VOTES STEPHANIE.
STEPHANIE.
THAT'S THREE VOTES STEPHANIE.
STEPHANIE.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES STEPHANIE, ONE
VOSE DESIREE.
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR," STEPHANIE.
THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
STEPHANIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, THE NAVITI FIVE KEEPS
WINNING AS AN ALLIANCE AND
LOSING AS A TRIBE.
SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE BATTLE LINES ARE
DRAWN.
DOMENICK AND CHRIS BOTH WANT
TO KILL EACH OTHER.
Jeff: THE TARGETS ARE
CLEAR.
I WORRY THAT I'M GOING TO BE
NEXT ONE TO GO.
Jeff: BUT A BOMB GOES OFF.
DROP YOUR BUFFS.
BRAND-NEW START THE "SURVIVOR:
GHOST ISLAND."
WHY, JEFF, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
DO THIS?
I'VE WITHIN WAITING 36
SEASONS TO PLAY THIS GAME AND TO
GO OUT FIFTH AND NOT BE ABLE TO
HAVE THE FULL EXPERIENCE BREAKS
MY HEART.
BUT I'VE ABSOLUTELY PLAYED THE
BEST GAME I COULD.
I PLAYED HARD, AND I STILL
BELIEVE IN MYSELF AND ULTIMATELY
I'M GOING TO GO HOME TO FAMILY
THAT I KNOW WILL BE PROUD OF ME.
