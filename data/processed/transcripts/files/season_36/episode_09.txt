        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY IS ON
"SURVIVOR," FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL, A UNIFIED NAVITI HAD A
PLAN OF ATTACK.
WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTES IN
CASE THERE IS AN IDOL BETWEEN
MICHAEL AND LIBBY.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MICHAEL PLAYED HIS IDOL.
THIS IS NOT JUST A STICK
ANYMORE.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR MICHAEL WILL
NOT COUNT.
AND LIBBY WAS SENT TO THE JURY.
LIBBY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING THE SEVEN NAVITI ON TOP
AND MICHAEL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
REMAINING FOUR MALOLO.








11 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
LAUREL, REMIND ME TO TELL YOU
THIS DREAM I HAD.
IT WAS ME AND YOU HAVING
BREAKFAST IN YOUR KITCHEN AND
MARTIN SHEEN WAS YOUR FATHER,
AND YOU MADE THE BEST BACON,
EGG, AND CHEESE ON ENGLISH
MUFFIN SANDWICHES AND WE'RE
EATING IT LIKE ANIMALS.
EVERYBODY IS SO HUNGRY.
FOOD IS SCARCE.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND IT
ALL JUST HIT ME, BUT I KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO NOT HAVE FOOD MANY
MY STOMACH.
I'VE DEALT WITH IT WHEN I WAS
HOMELESS.
AND THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE, IT
GAVE ME WHAT I NEEDED TO PLAY








SURVIVOR.
THAT'S WHAT I'M USING TO KEEP
MYSELF GOING DAY BY DAY IN ORDER
TO MAKE IT TO THE END.
THE PLAN IS FOR EVERYBODY TO
STAY NAVITI STRONG AND CUT OFF
THE REST OF MALOLO.
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR
ME, BECAUSE I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF
NAVITI.
SO THIS MIGHT SOUND LIKE A CRAZY
MOVE TO Y'ALL, BUT I'M READY THE
TAKE OUT NAVITI.
00%.
IF I DON'T SHIFT THINGS NOW
I'M GOING ON WITH MAF AND A HALF
STRONG AND HAVING EVERYONE RULE
MY VOTE.
I DIDN'T COME OUT TO FIJI TO BE
TOLD WHAT TO DO.
I CAME OUT HERE THE MAKE BIG
MOVES, AND I HAVE THIS FEELING
IN MY GUT THIS IS THE RIGHT
MOMENT.
WE COULD USE MIKE TOLL GET
OUT KELLYN.
THEN WE COULD GET OUT WENDELL
AND DOM.
THEY HAVE ALL THE POWER AND
THEY KNOW IT.
I KNOW I CAN PULL IN ANG AND
CHELSEA SO WE'LL HAVE A
MAJORITY.
I FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT
ROLLING WITH THE NAVITI CREW AND
STAYING TIGHT WITH DOM AND
WENDELL.
I KEPT IT HIDDEN FROM EVERYONE
THE ENTIRE TIME, BUT NOW THERE'S
TALK ABOUT OVERTHROWING THAT
SIDE, SO ONCE AGAIN I'M KIND OF
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
AND WHICH WAY I GO WILL HAVE A
HUGE IMPACT ON THE DIRECTION OF
THE GAME GOING FORWARD.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
YES, SIR.
YES.
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'LL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS
OF FIVE.
ON MY GO, TWO MEMBERS OF EACH
TEAM WILL PADDLE IN TO RESCUE
THEIR OTHER TEAM MEMBERS FROM
THREE CAGES.
YOU WILL THEN USE THE KEYS TO
UNLOCK A SERIES OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
YOU'LL USE THE PIECES TO SOLVE A
GIANT "SURVIVOR" PUZZLE.
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR IN.
YEAH.
Jeff: THE WINNING FIVE WILL
BE FLOWN BY CHOPPER TO A
BEAUTIFUL BLUFF.
NO WAY.
Jeff: OVERLOOKING THE
FIJIAN ISLANDS WHERE YOU WILL
ENJOY A PICNIC.
OH.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: BREAD, MEAT, CHEESES,
AND BROWNIES FOR DESSERT.
IN ADDITION, THE WINNING TEAM
WILL SEND SOMEBODY FROM THE
LOSING TEAM TO GHOST ISLAND.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A SCHOOLYARD
PICK WITH 11 PEOPLE.
THAT MEANS ONE PERSON WILL NOT
BE CHOSEN TO COMPETE, WILL
THEREFOREHAVE NOSE CHANCE TO WIN
REWARD AND CANNOT BE SENT THE
GHOST ISLAND.
WE'LL DRAW FOR CAPTAINS AND
CHOOSE OUR TEAMS.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
FOR ORANGE, IT IS MICHAEL AND
SEBASTIAN RESCUING CHELSEA,
KELLYN, AND JENNA.
FOR PURPLE, IT IS WENDI DAVIDSON
-- WENDELL AND DOMENICK
RESCUING LAUREL, DESIREE, AND
ANGELA.
DONATHAN WAS NOT PICKED.
HE HAS NO SHOT AT REWARD, NO
SHOT AT GHOST ISLAND.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST YOU GOT TO RELEASE YOUR
BOAT IN THE FRONT AND BACK AND
THEN START PADDLING TO THAT
FIRST CAGE.
GO, GUYS!
Jeff: YOU MUST UNTIE TO
RELEASE.
LET'S GO, DOM.
PADDLE.
PADDLE OUT, PADDLE OUT.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN AND MICHAEL
DOING A NICE JOB WITH THE EARLY
LEAD.
ONCE YOU GET TO THE PLATFORM,
SOMEBODY GETS OFF, YOU START
UNTYING.
CHELSEA CANNOT HELP UNTIE.
UP TO SEBASTIAN NOW.
MICHAEL WILL TRY TO HOLD ON TO
THAT PLATFORM.
WENDELL JUMPS ON TO THE
PLATFORM.
DOMENICK HAS TO GET IT BACK.
HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME HAS THE
BOAT CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY FROM
THE PLATFORM.
CHELSEA IS FREE.
GOOD JOB, BOYS.
Jeff: ORANGE NOW MOVING ON
TO THEIR SECOND CAGE.
LAUREL IS FREE.
DOMENICK STRUGGLING TO GET THAT
VOLT BACK TO THE CAGE AGAIN.
IT IS ORANGE IN THE EARLY LEAD.
ONCE AGAIN GOOD STRATEGY BY
ORANGE.
MICHAEL IS TRYING TO HOLD ON THE
THAT PLATFORM AS CHELSEA AND
SEBASTIAN NOW WORK TO UNTIE
KELLYN.
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE BOAT, YOU
GUYS.
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN PURPLE
STRUGGLING WITH THEIR BOAT.
LET'S GO, GUYS.
Jeff: ORANGE IS STARTING TO
PULL AWAY EARLY NOW.
KELLYN IS NOW FREE.
KEEP DIGGING.
IT'S NOT OVER.
GO!
Jeff: PURPLE IS TO THE
SECOND CAGE.
SEBASTIAN LEADS ORANGE QUICKLY
TO THEIR THIRD AND FINAL CAGE.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
HURRY UP.
Jeff: DESIREE IS FREE NOW.
SHE'S GOT GET IN THE BOAT.
SHE'S INCH WENDI WENDI WENDELL B
JENNA FREE FOR ORANGE.
PURPLE STILL HAS ONE PERSON LEFT
TO RESCUE.
TOGETHER.
Jeff: ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
ORANGE NOW WITH A NICE LEAD.
YOU HAVE TO GET TIED IN NOW.
THIS WAY SO IT DOESN'T BOUNCE
AS MUCH.
Jeff: PURPLE TRYING TO GET
TO ANGELA.
WENDELL IS THERE.
GOING TO START UNTYING.
YOU'RE GOOD.
ONE PERSON NOW UNLOCK THE PUZZLE
PIECES.
COME ON, GUYS.
Jeff: MIKELE WITH THE THREE
KEYS FOR ORANGE.
PURPLE STILL WORKING TO RELEASE
ANGELA.
THE BOTTOM, THE BOTTOM, THE
BOTTOM.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
Jeff: PURPLE HAS RESCUED
ANGELA.
THEY CAN NOW START PADDLING TO
SHORE.
MICHAEL HAS THE THIRD LOCK
UNDONE.
ORANGE NOW CAN START
TRANSPORTING THESE VERY HEAVY
PUZZLE PIECES TO THE FINISH
PLATFORM WHERE THEY CAN START
BUILDING THE PUZZLE.
HERE COMES PURPLE WORKING
TOGETHER TRYING TO CLOSE THE
GAP.
GOT TO GET IT TIED IN.
YOU'RE GOOD.
ONE PERSON ON THE KEYS NOW.
ORANGE ALREADY TRANSPORTING
PUZZLE PIECES, TRYING TO
CAPITALIZE ON THIS EARLY LEAD.
LET'S GO.
Jeff: WENDELL HAS THE THIRD
LOCK UNDONE.
NOW IT'S A RACE TO GET YOUR
PUZZLE PIECES UP THERE.
ORANGE, YOU'RE GOOD.
START SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
PURPLE STILL WITH SEVERAL PIECES
LEFT TO GET UP THERE.
ORANGE WITH A HUGE LEAD RIGHT
NOW.
HERE, THIS PEASE GOES IN.
Jeff: CAN ORANGE FINALLY
REVERSE THE CURSE MALOLO ALMOST
WINLESS THIS SEASON REGARDLESS
OF THE TRIBE MEMBERS.
STAND IT UP.
Jeff: PURPLE YOU'RE GOOD.
START SOLVING.
EXHAUSTION ALREADY SETTING IN.
GUYS, WE NEED A TALL SKINNY
PIECE.
Jeff: MICHAEL IS TAKING THE
LEAD FOR ORANGE.
IF HE'S RIGHT, HE WOULD BE
LEADING HIS TEAM TO A BIG
VICTORY.
THERE, THERE.
THIS GOES HERE.
THIS GOES THERE.
Jeff: DOMENICK BARKING OUT
ORDERS AT PURPLE.
HE SEEMS TO HAVE AN IDEA WHAT HE
WANTS TO DO.
ORANGE CONTINUES TO PLACE
PIECES.
WHY WOULD IT SAINT WIT AGAIN,
TWO TIMES?
Jeff: PURPLE TRYING TO GET
BACK IN THIS.
THEY'RE MOVING A LOT OF PIECES
AROUND.
THIS IS WRONG.
Jeff: BUT IS IT RESULTING
IN ACTION THAT MATTERS?
ARE THERE JOKE PIECES OUT
HERE?
THIS IS A DECOY.
THEY GOT DECOY PIECES OUT HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS ONE GOES NEXT TO THAT ONE.
GET THAT ONE OUT OF THERE.
Jeff: PURPLE NOW INCREASING
THE PACE.
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO PICK IT
UP.
OUTPLAY.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
WHY DOES IT SAY SURVIVOR
TWICE?
THERE'S AN EXTRA PIECE.
THERE'S A COUPLE EXTRA PIECES.
BOTTOM LEFT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHTS.
Jeff: ORANGE VERY CLOSE IF
THEY'RE RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON, LET'S GO.
Jeff: PURPLE SEES IT
SLIPPING AWAY.
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST WIN BY
ORANGE IN A LONG TIME.
YES!
Jeff: THEY THINK THEY HAVE
IT AND THEY DO.
SEBASTIAN, JENNA, KELLYN,
CHELSEA, AND MICHAEL.
ALL RIGHT.
KELLYN, MICHAEL, CHELSEA, JENNA,
SEBASTIAN, NICE AFTERNOON
WAITING FOR YOU.
BEFORE YOU LEAVE, YOU'RE SENDING
ONE PERSON FROM THE LOSING FIVE
TO GHOST ISLAND.
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
IT'S EITHER A UNANIMOUS DECISION
OR YOU FORCE THEM TO DRAW ROCKS.
DONATHAN IS NOT PART OF THIS.
ROCKS IT IS.
ROCK IT IS THEN.
Jeff: ROCKS IT IS.
LEAVE IT UP TO CHANCE.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
ANG.
Jeff: ANGELA GOING TO GO TO
GHOST ISLAND.
YOU CAN DROP YOUR ROCKS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
ANGELA HEADING OFF TO GHOST
ISLAND.
STAY STRONG, ANG.
Jeff: YOU WILL RETURN IN
TIME FOR THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
KELLYN, MICHAEL, CHELSEA, JENNA,
SEBASTIAN, A NICE AFTERNOON
AWAITS.
COME GET YOUR PICNIC.
HEAD OUT.
HAVE FUN, GUYS.
EN JOY.
YOU EARNED IT.
EAT, BRO.
Jeff: DESIREE, WENDELL,
LAUREL, DOMENICK, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.
AFTER LAST TRIBAL, I'M THE
BIGGEST TARGET IN THIS GAME.
A WHOLE LOT IS NOT GOING TO
CHANGE UNLESS I'M ABLE TO KIND
OF STIR THIS POT A BIT.
SO THIS REWARD IS THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOME CRACKS
IN THE NAVITI GROUP AND GET
MYSELF BACK IN THE GAME.
IT IS JUST ME OR DOES IT FEEL
LIKE WE'RE FLYING INTO JURASSIC
PARK RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS SO COOL.
THIS IS THE GNARLIEST THING I'VE
EVER DONE.
RIDING IN A HELICOPTER IS
INCREDIBLE.
THE DOORS WERE DOWN.
WE WERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER,
CRACKING JOKES THE WHOLE TIME.
I WAS LITERALLY SMILING EAR TO
EAR.
I'M STILL SMILING JUST THINKING
ABOUT IT.
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO WHEN YOU
GET HIGHS LIKE THAT.
IT WAS SO SICK.
LOOK HOW MUCH SALMON.
LOOK HOW MUCH.
MY DREAM CAME TRUE.
SHALL WE DO A LITTLE TOAST
HERE?
CHEERS.
SANDWICH ON A BLUFF.
THE FACT THAT I SAW SEVEN
VOTES AT THE LAST TRIBAL REALLY
MADE THIS REWARD THAT MUCH
SWEETER FOR ME, BECAUSE REWARDS
OPEN PEOPLE UP MORE TO, YOU
KNOW, TALKING STRATEGY AND
DISCUSSING DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
GUYS, THIS SERIOUSLY MIGHT BE
ONE OF THE WEST MEALS I'VE EVER
HAD IN MY LIFE.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I KNOW I'M
LIKE ON THE VERY BOTTOM, BUT NOW
THAT I AM ESSENTIALLY COMPLETELY
POWERLESS, I HOPE THAT, YOU
KNOW, YOU GUYS CAN SEE SOME
VALUE IN ME MOVING FORWARD AS AN
EXTRA NUMBER.
I WANT TO THROW THAT OUT.
I'M HERE.
I'M A LOYAL VOTE.
DAY BY DAY.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TOMORROW.
MICHAEL SAYS I'M WILLING TO
WORK WITH YOU ALL, AND SEBASTIAN
AND CHELSEA WERE KIND OF LIKE,
HMM, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.
THAT'S A GREAT SIGN THAT WE'RE
STILL NAVITI STRONG, AND NEITHER
OF THEM IS WILLING TO SWITCH ON
THE PLAN THAT I WANT TO KEEP
GOING DOWN, WHICH IS GETTING
MICHAEL NEXT.
THAT SANDWICH IS AS BIG AS
YOUR HEAD, KELLYN.
THINGS KEEP GOING MY WAY, AND
I CAN FEEL MY GAME RAMPING UP,
SO ALL THINGS ARE LOOKING SWELL
ON THIS BLAST IN THE MIDDLE OF
FIJI.
GOING THE GHOST ISLAND AND
NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT I'M
GOING INTO RAISES MY ANXIETY
LEVEL, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I
WANT EXPERIENCE.
IT WOULDN'T BE SURVIVOR WITHOUT
EXPERIENCING ALL THE ELEMENTS.
AND IF I HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
AN ADVANTAGE, HECK, YEAH, I
WOULD RATHER BE AT GHOST THAN
BACK AT CHANCE.
WOULD RATHER BE AT GHOST THAN
BACK AT CHANCE.
GAME ON.
GHOST ISLAND GAME OF CHANCE, THE
ODDS HAVE IMPROVED.
TWO OF THOSE HOLD POWER.
RISK YOUR VOTE TO PLAY.
WELL, WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.
WITHOUT MY VOTE, IT WOULDN'T
MATTER.
I HAVE A 2-3 CHANCE TO HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE.
THAT'S HUGE.
THE ORIGINAL NAVITI HAS THE
NUMBERS, AND I THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO STAY SOLID.
SO THIS IS WORTH THE RISK.
I GOT TO GO FOR IT.
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THREE.
NO VOTE.
WELL, IT'S ALL ABOUT CHANCE, AND
I LOST IT.
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT
SAID "NO VOTE."
AND I WAS LIKE, OH, DID I MAKE A
BAD DECISION?
BECAUSE IF THERE'S STRATEGY TALK
WHILE I'M GONE AND WE'RE NO
LONGER GOING NAVITI STRONG, MY
NO VOTE POTENTIALLY COULD MESS
UP MY GAME.
ARE YOU UP WITH WHAT THEY
WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER THIS
MORNING?
I DON'T LOVE IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?
I'M OPEN IT TO.
I JUST FEEL SAFER WITH DOM
AND WENDELL.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DECIDE TO GO
ALONG WITH DES'S PLAN TO GO
AFTER THE BIG THREATS OF NAVITI,
BUT THE TRUTH IS I TRUST DOM AND
WENDELL A LOT MORE THAN I TRUST
DEZ.
I DECIDED TO SHOW THEM YOUR
BOTTOM PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE
ON THE BOTTOM ANY LONGER.
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE.
OKAY.
SO I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DES,
BECAUSE DES IS TRYING TO RALLY
MALOLO FOUR AGAINST YOU GUYS.
WHICH I OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO
DO.
ALL RIGHT.
SO THAT WHOLE PLAN --
 HER AND CHELSEA AND THEM WANT
YOU GUYS OUT.
WHICH IS ME AND WENDELL AND
KELLYN.
APPARENTLY SOME OF THE NAVITI
GIRLS DECIDED THEY WANT TO TAKE
CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FATE AND
FLIP ON SOME OF THE BIG THREATS
IN THIS GAME.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE THAT
THESE WEAKER NAVITI PLAYERS ARE
READY TO MAKE A MOVE, AND IF
THEY'RE WILLING TO GO AGAINST
THE FAMILY, I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE OUT.
WHAT'S UP?
I'M HEARING FROM LAUREL
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT DES AND
CHELSEA ARE GOING TO WORK WITH
THE MALOLO FOUR TO TAKE OUT ME,
YOU, AND WENDELL.
THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE TO CREATE
A RESUME, THEY HAVE TO START
TAKING OUT BIG PLAYERS.
NO WAY.
WHY?
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
I'VE BEEN WITH DES FROM THE
BEGINNING.
I GET FROM LIKE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL DAY I'VE HAD IN MY
LIFE, AND THEN DOM WAS IN MY
EAR, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, AND
THOSE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH THE CLOSEST ARE THE ONES
THAT ARE COMING AFTER ME.
IF CHELSEA IS AGAINST ME, THEN
SHE SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY PLAYING
ME.
WE GOT TO FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT.
NONE OF THIS IS ADDING UP.
ME, DES, AND CHELSEA ARE
UNBREAKABLE.
THEY WOULD NEVER TURN ON ME LIKE
THAT.
CLEARLY SOMEONE IS TRYING TO
TAKE THE TARGET OFF OF MICHAEL,
AND I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON OVER
THERE?
THEY WANT ME OUT OF HERE SO
BAD.
IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER IDOL, NOW
WOULD BE THE TIME TO PLAY IT.
I DON'T, BUT I THINK THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE THERE COULD BE ONE
HERE.
I'LL GO LOOK.
DO YOU WANT TO?
YEAH.
CLEARLY I'M ON THE BOTTOM.
I'M NOT AFRAID IF ANYBODY KNOWS
I'M LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.
I'M SURE EVERYONE IS EXPECTING
ME TO.
DONATHAN WANTED TO LOOK, AS
WELL.
PART OF ME DIDN'T WANT TO GO
SEARCHING WITH HIM.
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST
MISTAKES IN THIS GAME THE SHARE
WITH REALLY ANYBODY THAT YOU
HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT
I'M AT THE POINT IN MY GAME
WHERE IT'S A MATTER OF ME GOING
HOME NEXT VOTE OR DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIND ONE.
HOME NEXT VOTE OR DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIND ONE.
NO WAY.
NO WAY.
OH, MY GOD.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS IS SCOT'S AUTHENTIC
IMMUNITY IDOL FROM THE 32nd
SEASON, BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN
VERSUS BEAUTY.
SCOT TRUSTED HIS AHYNES
BELIEVING THEY WOULD COMBINE
IDOLS TO FORM A SUPER IDOL.
THE SUPER IDOL CAN BE PLAY
TOGETHER AFTER THE VOTES HAVE
BEEN READ.
SO SCOT DID NOT PLAY HIS
IDOL.
Jeff: NINTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE FOURTH MEMBER OF HIS
JURY, SCOT.
TAI CHANGED HIS MIND.
WOW.
IT IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE
BIGGEST BETRAYALS IN "SURVIVOR"
HISTORY.
THIS TAINTED IDOL NOW HAS NO
POWER ON ITS OWN, BUT WHEN
PAIRED WITH TAI'S MATCHING IDOL
IT BECOMES A REGULAR IDOL WITH
FULL POWER.
TAI'S IDOL IS HIDDEN UNDERNEATH
THE CENTER OF YOUR SHELTER.
CAN YOU REVERSE THE CURSE?
I'M JUST LIKE FREAKING OUT,
BECAUSE NOW I'VE GOT TO DIG
UNDER THE SHELTER FOR THIS OTHER
IDOL THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
PAIRED WITH THIS ONE.
I'M LIKE, HOW IN THE HELL AM I
GOING TO DO THAT.
SO I POPPED MY AS RIGHT THERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE SHELTER.
WHAT'S UP, BIG BOY?
YOU WANT TO MAKE RICE?
I THINK IT'S ALREADY STARTED.
IT FELT LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS
WATCHING ME.
LIKE WHEN IS ONE GOING TO COME
THROUGH THIS WOOD.
WHEN IS ONE GOING TO COME FROM
THE DAMN OCEAN.
SHOULD I PUT MY HAIR BACK UP
OR LEAVE IT DOWN?
IT LOOKS GOOD.
TELL ME IF I NEED TO PULL IT
BACK.
IT WAS THE NERVE-RACKINGEST
THING I HAD TO DO OUT HERE FOR
SURE.
I DON'T WANT THE MAKE IT
OBVIOUS.
I GOT LAUREL OVER HERE WITH ME.
THEN HERE COMES JENNA AND
MICHAEL.
I'M LIKE, YOU GOT TO HELP ME.
THERE'S AN IDOL UNDER HERE.
I HAVE TO GET THE THING.
LET ME GET MY CANTEEN.
I'LL GO FISHING.
THANKFULLY DOMENICK AND WE
HAD A MOMENT TOGETHER.
FINALLY I GET THAT BABY UP.
I WAS LIKE, YES, YOU KNOW.
I THANK YOU GUYS.
I FOUND SOMETHING THAT'S GOING
TO HELP ME IN THIS GAME, IF IT'S
TO SAVE MALOLO, IF IT'S TO SAVE
ME.
I FEEL LIKE THESE TWO BABIES ARE
LOCKED AND LOAD AND READY TO GO
AND HOPEFULLY THEY REVERSE THE
CURSE.
AND HOPEFULLY THEY REVERSE THE
CURSE.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
WE'LL NOW BRING IN LANG
RETURNING FROM GHOST ISLAND.
WELCOME BACK.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
YES, SIR.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
DESIREE BROUGHT YOUR NECKLACE
BACK, ANGELA, ANDLY TAKE IT.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE A BALL ON A
DISK ATTACHED TO TWO ROWS.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU'LL MOVE
YOUR HANDS FURTHER DOWN THE
ROPE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT
TO BALANCE.
IF AT ANY POINT YOUR BALL DROPS,
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE AT THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE TENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, THIRD MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
FOR IMMUNITY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
WE'LL STAY AT THIS SPOT FOR TEN
MINUTES.
EVERYBODY VERY SOLID OUT OF THE
GATE.
WENDELL WITH A NIGHT RECOVERY.
WENDELL DROPS QUICK LIMP WENDELL
FIRST OUT.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
JUST LIKE THAT WE'RE DOWN TO
TEN.
JENNA DROPS.
DES ON THE MOVE.
SHE DROPS.
IT'S LIKE IT WAS CONTAGIOUS.
LAUREL DROPS.
ANGELA DROPS.
MICHAEL'S BALL IS NOW MOVING
QUICKLY.
CAN HE SAVE IT?
AND HE DOES.
WOW.
WITHIN A FEW SECONDS WE LOST
HALF THE GROUP.
AND WE'RE DOWN TO SIX LESS THAN
A MINUTE INTO THIS CHALLENGE.
IT'S A GOOD REMINDER THAT YOU
CAN'T LET SOMEBODY ELSE'S
ANXIETY KNOCK YOU OUT.
DONATHAN'S BALL IS ON THE MOVE.
DONATHAN DROPS.
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
WE HAVE RUN THIS CHALLENGE
BEFORE, AND IT HAS GONE FOR A
LONG TIME.
THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE TODAY.
CHELSEA ROCK SOLID.
JUST LIKE THAT DOMENICK'S BALL
TAKES OFF AND DOMENICK IS OUT.
WE ARE TWO MINUTES IN AND WE
HAVE ALREADY LOST SEVEN OF THE
11.
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
WE'RE DOWN CHELSEA, SEBASTIAN,
KELLYN, AND MICHAEL FOR
IMMUNITY.
YOU'VE GOT STAY PRESENT IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
SEBASTIAN'S BALL STARTS TO MOVE.
NICE RECOVERY.
HE CENTERS IT BACK.
THE CLOSER TO CENTER THE MORE
ROOM YOU HAVE TO TRY TO SAVE
YOURSELF.
ONE MINUTE LEFT IN THIS ROUND.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SURVIVE A
LITTLE LONGER AND YOU WILL MOVE
ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.
OUT OF NOWHERE MICHAEL'S BALL
STARTS THE MOVE.
MICHAEL IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.
TAKE HEED.
THAT IS HOW FAST YOU CAN BE OUT
OF THIS CHALLENGE.
MICHAEL WAS ROCK SOLID.
THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF MOVEMENT
AND THAT BALL TAKES OFF.
WE'LL GO TEN MINUTES IN THIS
FIRST ROUND.
AND THEN WE WILL MOVE FURTHER
DOWN THE ROPE, MAKING IT EVEN
MORE DIFFICULT.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE NOW FURTHER BACK, HANDS
FURTHER DOWN ON THE ROPE.
MUCH TOUGHER TO BALANCE.
AND WE WILL GO FOR 15 MINUTES.
SOMEONE'S GOING DOWN REAL
FAST RIGHTS NOW.
Jeff: CHELSEA WITH A LITTLE
BIT OF MOVEMENT.
IN HER ROPE.
THOSE FOREARMS STRUGGLING.
SEBASTIAN WITH A LITTLE MORE
MOVEMENT.
ANOTHER NICE RECOVERY.
SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE THIRD
MEMBER OF THE JURY.
KELLYN DROPS.
FRUSTRATED.
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.
IT IS A SHOWDOWN.
CHELSEA AND SEBASTIAN FIGHTING
FOR IMMUNITY AND SECURITY AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WHOA, MAN.
Jeff: FATIGUE NOW STARTING
TO SET IN.
BODIES NOW STARTING TO SHAKE.
SEBASTIAN'S BALL SUDDENLY ON THE
MOVE.
HE'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF
DISASTER.
BUT HE IS STILL IN IT.
CHELSEA IS SHAKING.
SEBASTIAN MOVING AGAIN.
CAN HE SAVE IT AGAIN?
HE DOES.
THAT'S TWO SAVES.
MAKE IT THREE.
SEBASTIAN DROPS.
HE'S OUT.
CHELSEA WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, THIRD WOMAN IN A ROW
TO WEAR THAT NECKLACE.
GOOD JOB, CHELS.
Jeff: THAT WAS A SHOWDOWN.
CHELSEA, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
 GOOD JOB, CHELS.
Jeff: NICE JOB.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
YOU CONTINUE THE DOMINANCE BY
WOMEN IN THE INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGES IN THIS GAME.
THIRD WOMAN IN A ROW TO WIN.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SADLY,
AFTER 27 VERY TOUGH DAYS IN THIS
GAME, THE DREAM OF GETTING TO
THE END WILL FALL SHORT FOR ONE
OF YOU.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE TENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, THE THIRD
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IT WON'T BE YOU.
CONGRATS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
THE GAME PLAN OUT OF THE GATE
WAS MICHAEL IS GOING HOME
TONIGHT, BUT I BELIEVE STRONGLY
THAT THE GOATS ARE COMING
TOGETHER TO FORM AN ALLIANCE AND
WE NEED TO BE PREPARED AND GET
AHEAD OF IT BEFORE IT BITES US
IN THE BUTT.
NICE JOB, CHELS.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
YOU LOOKED LIKE A STUD.
THE WOMEN ARE OUT THERE DOING
THEIR THING.
GOOD JOB, LADIES.
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WENT
PERFECTLY.
KELLYN LOST.
AND NOW I CAN PUT MY PLAN IN
EFFECT, BECAUSE KELLYN'S
DANGEROUS.
SHE HAS GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH
PEOPLE.
SHE HAS A GREAT PERSONALITY.
AND SHE'S PLAYING THIS GAME WAY
HARDER THAN ANYBODY THINKS.
SO IF I'M SITTING NEXT TO KELLYN
AT THE FINAL THREE, SHE WINS
HANDS DOWN.
SO SHE HAS TO GO.
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?
AT CAMP?
YEAH, ANYTHING?
NO.
DOM MAKES ME NERVOUS BECAUSE
HE'S PARANOID ALL THE TIME.
I'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR IN THE GAME
BY TRUSTING MY GUT INSTEAD OF
LISTENING TO EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND ME, AND DOM'S BEEN
PARANOID EVERY VOTE, AND NOW
HE'S TRYING TO BRING ME INTO
THAT.
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
DOM WAS PANICKED LAST NIGHT WHEN
I CAME BACK.
ABOUT WHAT?
THAT YOU AND CHELSEA WERE
COMING AFTER ME.
THIS MORNING I WOKE UP, AND I'M
LIKE, THERE'S IN WAY THAT THAT'S
WHAT DES AND CHELSEA ARE GOING
TO DO, I HAVE BEEN WITH THOSE
GIRLS SINCE DAY ONE.
DO YOU THINK IT'S COMING FROM
LAUREL OR DONATHAN IN
LAUREL TOLD DOM AND DOM TOLD
ME.
I THINK SHE'S STARTING TO --
 SHE'S TRYING TO STIR THE POT.
THE PLAN WAS SO GOOD.
I WAS PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY, AND LAUREL JUST
MESSED IT ALL UP.
WHY?
KELLYN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST
BLIND SIDE EVER, BUT THAT PLAN
JUST BLEW UP IN MY FACE, AND I'M
FURIOUS.
THE PLAN WILL JUST BE TO PUT
THE VOTES ON DOM.
HE TALKS TO DOM SAYING I'M
TRYING TO COME AFTER KELLYN, AND
NOW EVERYBODY IS FREAKING OUT
LOOKING AT ME BECAUSE YOU'RE
THROWING MY NAME OUT THERE.
I WAS PISSED.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST ANY
OF THEM NOW.
SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE BACK TO
GETTING RID OF MICHAEL.
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO COVER MY
TRACKS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IT'S ME WORKING WITH Y'ALL.
DON'T MAKE UP A STORY.
I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW YOU
UNDER THE BUS.
I'M JUST SAYING DON'T TRY TO
THROW ME UNDER THE BUS.
SOMEHOW DES'S SCHEMING IS
COMING BACK ON ME.
DES ASKED WHY I WOULD BLOW UP
THIS PLAN, AND AS SOON AS
WENDELL CAME UP, SHE SWITCHED
HER STORY AND IT WAS WE NEVER
HAD THIS CONVERSATION.
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO
EVERYONE?
WE ALL KNOW SHE WAS PITCHING,
YOU KNOW, MAKING THIS MOVE.
I WAS THERE FOR THAT
CONVERSATION, JUST IN CASE.
I KIND OF JUMPED IN THE
MIDDLE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
ALL OF A SUDDEN MY GAME IS
BLOWING UP IN MY FACE, AND NOW
IT'S JUST A HE SAID/SHE SAID.
SHE CAME OVER AND YELLED AT
ME IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
I CAME OVER AND SAID I DID
NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HER
WITH FIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO VOTE
OUT ANYONE FROM NAVITI BECAUSE I
WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT I'M
NOT LYING.
OKAY.
OKAY.
ANYMORE TO THE CONVERSATION?
NO.
OKAY.
ONE OF THE MALOLO IS GOING HOME.
RIGHT?
OKAY.
HI.
HOW YOU DOING?
SHE SEEMS PRETTY ERRATIC TO ME.
CLEARLY SOMETHING'S GOING ON
WITH DES.
AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE SHE'S
LOOKING TO FLIP ON ME, SO THE
BIG PLAYERS NEED TO COME
TOGETHER AND TAKE DEFENSE ON
THAT WERE SOMETHING HAPPENS.
OBVIOUSLY THE DYNAMIC HAS
CHANGED.
SO I MEAN, IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT
THE STRONG NEED TO BIND
TOGETHER.
SO I MEAN, I'M READY TO COMMIT
TO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
YEAH.
I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED AGAIN
TONIGHT SINCE I PLAYED MY IDOL.
I HAVE NO SAFETY NET.
IT'S MY WORST NIGHTMARE.
FORTUNATELY THINGS HAVE CHANGED
UP, BECAUSE THE NAVITI SEVEN IS
DEFINITELY BROKEN AND IT'S ABOUT
TO JUST COMPLETELY SHATTER.
THE CONVERSATION --
 WHAT CONVERSATION?
DES SAYING SHE WANTED TO COME
OVER.
AND GO AFTER WHO?
KELLYN.
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BIGGEST
THREAT.
DES, WHAT'S GOING ON?
HONESTLY, SWEAR TO GOD, I DID
NOT SAY THAT.
WHY WOULD I LEAVE THE SIDE OF
THE NUMBERS?
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE
TRUTH, AND IT'S HARD WHEN THE
STORY IS CHANGING.
KELLYN, I'M LOYAL AND I'M
GOING TO VOTE HOW WE ALL ALWAYS
VOTE.
LAUREL IS TELLING ME ONE
THING.
DES IS TELLING ME ANOTHER.
I CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
TRUTH IS.
BUT EITHER WAY, MY GUT IS
TELLING ME NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO BLOW UP NAVITI.
I NEED TO KNOW ONE THING FROM
YOU.
YES.
DO YOU NOW BELIEVE LAUREL OR
DO YOU BELIEVE DES, BECAUSE I
WANT DES THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
NO, DOM, US GIRLS HAVE BEEN
HOLDING TO WHAT YOU GUYS WANT,
AND WE WANT MICHAEL OUT.
RIGHT.
TONIGHT.
NOW.
NOW.
HUH.
KELLYN IS HAMMERING ME GOOD.
SHE'S LIKE, DOM, YOU'RE
PARANOID.
WE'RE CALLING THE SHOTS THIS
TIME, AND IT SCARES THE HELL OUT
OF ME.
YOU GUYS ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT
GOING TO DO THIS WHOLE STRONG
BOYS THING, BUT NOW ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU ALL ARE BEST FRIENDS
WITH MICHAEL.
YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD
MAKE US FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD.
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GO BUST
OUT HERE, BUT I HAVE TO TRUST MY
INSTINCT, AND IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE LAUREL IS ACTUALLY SPEAKING
THE TRUTH.
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT
ARE LOOKING TO TAKE CONTROL OF
THIS GAME, SO KELLYN AND I NEED
TO COME TOGETHER OR I THINK
WE'RE ALL DEAD.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS AND LIBBY VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO 27 DAYS.
DONATHAN, ARE YOU STARTING TO
FEEL THE PRESSURE AS THE NUMBERS
DWINDLE?
OH, YEAH.
I MEAN, TODAY, LIKE, BAM, IT WAS
READY TO GO, IT WAS LIT.
Jeff: WHAT WAS LIT?
DESIREE.
SHE HEARD SOMETHING THROUGH THE
GRAPE VINE AND IT INVOLVED
LAUREL AND FIREWORKS HAPPENED.
Jeff: WOW.
THAT'S A BIG WORD.
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR NAME
THROWN OUT THERE AND YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU BACK IS AGAINST THE
WALL, THERE'S GOING TO BE
FIREWORKS.
Jeff: SO YOU HEARD YOUR
NAME?
YES, I HEARD MY NAME, AND I
HEARD THE SOURCE WAS LAUREL.
I DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.
I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE SOURCE.
THAT'S WHAT I DID.
AND WHEN SHE SAID SHE CAME
THE TALK TO ME, SHE CAME TO YELL
AT ME.
IT WAS AN ATTACK IN FRONT OF THE
TRIBE.
HER BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL
BECAUSE SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A LIE,
AND THAT'S WHY SHE REACTED THE
WAY SHE DID.
WHAT'S THE LIE?
SHE APPROACHED A COMBINATION
OF THE MALOLO FOUR AND SAID
DOMENICK, WENDELL AND KELLYN ARE
RUNNING THE SHOW, HER, CHELSEA,
AND ANGELA ARE TO BE BOTTOM.
THEY WANT TO WORK WITH US TO
MAKE A MOVE.
BACK THAT UP.
CAN I REPLY?
Jeff: ALWAYS.
I DON'T LIKE TO DO THE WHOLE
BACK-AND-FORTH THING.
SO I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY THIS
ONCE AND AFTER THIS I'M DONE
WITH IT.
I NEVER ONCE SAID THAT I FELT
THEY WAS ON THE BOTTOM.
EVER.
UH-UH, HONEY.
YOU APPROACHED US SAYING YOU
KNOW YOU AND ANG ARE ON THE
BOTTOM AND YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO WORK WITH US TO GET OUT
KELLYN.
ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOK
KELLYN IN THE EYES AND TELL HER
YOU DID NOT HAVE THAT
CONVERSATION?
I ALREADY DID.
SEVERAL TIMES.
SEVERAL TIMES.
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A CHANCE TO
PIPE IN AND I WOULD LIKE THE SAY
WHEN DES APPROACHED LAUREL, IT
WAS JUST MALOLO, AND SHE PRETTY
MUCH CALLED OUT LAUREL FOR
SCREWING UP THE WHOLE PLAN AND
AS SOON AS WENDELL WALKED UP --
 WENDELL WAS THERE THE WHOLE
TIME.
HE CAME HALFWAY THROUGH.
HE WALKED UP.
THEN SHE WAS JUST ACTING LIKE IT
NEVER HAPPENED.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAYER
THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM TRYING TO
MAKE A MOVE.
THE
 YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM AND
YOU'RE STILL ON THE BOTTOM.
Jeff: CHELSEA, YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS, TOO.
IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE FOR ME, I
FEEL GOOD WITH THE PEOPLE I'M
ALIGNED WITH.
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO MAKE NAVITI FEEL UNSAFE,
BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR ONLY WAY UP
IS IF NAVITI BREAKS APART AND
ISN'T STRONG ANYMORE.
Jeff: DOMENICK, DESIREE IS
ADAMANT THAT SHE'S TELLING THE
TRUTH, AND LAUREL, JENNA, AND
DONATHAN AND MICHAEL ARED A
MANTD THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE
TRUTH.
AND THE SICKEST PART ABOUT IT IS
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE THE
STRAIGHTEST FACE AND WILL LOOK
YOU IN THE EYE AND CONVINCE YOU
THAT THEY ARE NOT LYING TO YOU.
Jeff: WENDELL, IT'S TRICKY,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR TRUTH.
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU
HAVE THESE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE
WORKED WITH FOR SO LONG, BUT
THEN YOU HAVE THIS INFORMATION
THAT CAME OUT THAT JUST LEADS
YOU TO SECOND GUESS YOUR OWN
FAMILY PER SE.
SO I'M SITTING HERE BEING A
LISTENER AND OBSERVING AND
TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
THIS.
Jeff: MICHAEL, DESPITE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE
REAL STORY, SOMEBODY IS GOING
HOME.
YEAH.
I MEAN, I'M DEFINITELY NOT
COMFORTABLE.
I HAVE NOT BEEN COMFORTABLE FOR
THE PAST FEW VOTES.
I'M GLAD THAT SOMETHING DID
HAPPEN TO ALL BLOW UP, BUT I
STILL SIT HERE WITH MY HEART
BEATING LIKE HELL.
Jeff: DONATHAN, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW?
THIS COULD BE THE ONE
OPPORTUNITY MALOLO HAS TO SHIFT
A LITTLE.
EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY I'M SO PISSED,
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WAS SAID.
THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENED.
SO I AM GOING TO SIT HERE AND
SAY, HELL, YES.
THE TRUTH SHALL SET US FREE.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: WHICH IS A GREAT
STATEMENT TO SAY, BUT THE RESULT
COULD BE ONE OF THE FOUR OF YOU
ARE THE ONE THAT GOES HOME.
DEFINITELY.
Jeff: SO LAUREL, YOU'RE
HOPING THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN
THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.
THAT'S YOUR ONE SHOT.
YEAH, IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR
NAVITI TO LISTEN TO WHAT'S GOING
ON, BUT IT'S STILL JUST A
CULT-LIKE SOCIETY OVER HERE.
AND I'M FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE
EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID IS THE
TRUTH.
Jeff: KELLYN, IT'S LIKE THE
PERFECT CRIME.
THERE'S TWO VERSIONS, BOTH VERY
PLAUSIBLE, ONLY ONE CAN BE TRUE.
AND IF YOU BETRAY NAVITI, YOU
COULD BE WE -- BETRAYING
SOMEBODY THAT WAS LOYAL.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE
SHERLOCK HOLMES ALL DAY AND I
FEEL LIKE HELEN KELLER, BUT I
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FOUR MALOLO
ARE SAYING.
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR WHETHER
IT'S NOT, I'M LOOKING AT IT LIKE
A DETECTIVE, FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS
HAPPENING, LOOK AT EVERYONE AND
TRY TO DO FOR MYSELF WHAT I
THINK IS BEST FOR ME AND THE
PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH.
Jeff: DESIREE, YOUR BEST
ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT COULD BE
TO SAY, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
DISRUPT THE NAVITI SEVEN BASED
ON SPECULATION.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
ALL DAY.
SO ALL I CAN DO IS JUST HOPE
FATE IS ON MY SIDE AND LET'S GET
TO THE VOTE.
LET'S GET TO THE VOTE.
WILL REST GET TO THE VOTE.
Jeff: YOU'RE READY TO GET
TO THE VOTE?
LET'S GET TO THE VOTE.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JENNA, YOU'RE UP.
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T BITE ME
LATER.
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T BITE ME
LATER.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DESIREE.
DESIREE.
TWO VOTES DESIREE.
DESIREE.
THAT'S THREE VOTES DESIREE.
DESIREE.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES DESIREE.
MICHAEL.
FOUR VOTES DESIREE, ONE VOTE
MICHAEL.
MICHAEL.
TWO VOTES MICHAEL.
DESIREE.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES DESIREE, TWO
VOTES MICHAEL.
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
DESIREE.
THAT'S SIX.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
DESIREE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LADY, YOU ALL BETTER KEEP
WINNING.
Jeff: WELL, MAYBE THE
LESSON FROM TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS
WHETHER YOU'RE LYING OR TELLING
THE TRUTH, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
RELATIONSHIPS TO BUILD TRUST,
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO THE
END.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," A TWIST IN THE
GAME -- TWO PEOPLE WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT -- LEADS THE LIES.
KNOW I LOVE YOU.
I DID A GOOD JOB LYING.
DONATHAN IS AN IDIOT.
IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, IT
WILL BE PRETTY FREAKIN' SWEET.
THEY COULD TELL I WAS LYING.
OH, MAN, I GAVE IT MY ALL.
I TRIED THE ACT AS REAL AS
POSSIBLE.
BUT IT IS JUST SUCH A SHAME
BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT THERE, LIKE
KELLYN WAS JUST THE FIRST.
I HAD PLANS, BABY.
I HAD PLANS.
AND LAUREL MESSED IT ALL UP.
SO, HEY, I TRUSTED THE WRONG
PERSON I GUESS.
