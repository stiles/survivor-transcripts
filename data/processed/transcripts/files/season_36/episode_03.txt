        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE MALOLO TRIBE,
A SWITCH GAVE THE OLD NAVITI
ALLIANCE 5-4 ADVANTAGE.
I COULD NOT IMAGINE IT
WORKING OUT BETTER.
Jeff: AND BRADLEY WAS
GETTING COCKY.
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE THEM OUT.
Jeff: THE NAVITI TRIBE WAS
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WITH CHRIS AT GHOST ISLAND,
DOMENICK, MORGAN, AND WENDELL
WERE READY TO VOTE OUT ONE OF
THEIR OWN.
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT
ANGELA?
BUT THE MALOLO FOUR SAW AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUT MAJOR
THREAT.








WE CAN EITHER USE WENDELL OR
MORGAN.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DOMENICK AND WENDELL VOTED FOR
ANGELA.
Jeff: ANGELA.
BUT THEY WERE BOTH BLIND SIDED
WHEN MORGAN WAS SENT HOME.
Jeff: MORGAN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
I HAVE THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE
THAT I AM WILLING TO DOMENICK.
Jeff: 17 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
GOOD MOVE, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT ME.
ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS
A LITTLE BIT?








NOT REALLY.
NO.
ONE THING I CAN SAY IS, THAT
YOU KNOW, WE DECIDED TO STAY
STRONG.
YOU CERTAINLY DID.
THIS IS A CRAZY GAME.
ANGELA, I'M SORRY FOR GIVING
YOU MY VOTE.
WENDELL AND DOM STABBED ME IN
THE BACK.
I THOUGHT I COULD TRUST BOTH OF
THEM, BUT A WOLF IS A WOLF,
RATHERLESS IF YOU'RE DESCRIBES
IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.
WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF, YOU'RE
STILL A WOLF.
WANT THE TAKE A WALK, HUG IT
OUT A LITTLE BIT?
ME AND WENDELL HAD SUCH A
NICE GAME PLAN SET IN PLACE.
WE ALL WERE GOING TO VOTE
ANGELA.
BUT THE FORMER MALOLO CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE.
YEAH, WE GOT OUR ASS KICKED OUT
THERE.
WE MADE ENEMIES.
AIDES CRAZY.
THEY GOT IT DONE TONIGHT,
THOUGH.
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELA NOW.
CHRIS STILL WANTS ME DEAD.
SHE WANTS US DEAD.
AND HE'S GOT NO IDEA WHAT HE'S
WALKING INTO.
IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER.
A DISASTER.
A COMPLETE AND UTTER
DISASTER.
WELL, I'M WITH YOU.
SO, I MEAN, AT LEAST WE GOT THE
TWO OF US.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
I GOT IN OVER MY HEAD.
THAT'S WHAT I DID.
BUT STILL, LISTEN TO ME, I
HAVE A REAL IDOL.
YOU DO IN.
YES.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
THERE'S HOPE.
WE MIGHT BE ON THE BOTTOM,
BUT FORTUNATELY MY BUDDY
DOMENICK FOUND AN IDOL.
WOW.
THAT'S GREAT.
NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SHAKE
THINGS UP A BIT.
LOOK, JUST SAME WAY THAT WE
BROKE FROM OUR GROUP, MAYBE
SOMEONE OVER THERE WILL BREAK
FROM THEIRS.
IT'S DOABLE.
IT'S DOABLE.
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO MAKE
THE SMARTEST PLAY THAT WE CAN
MAKE.
WE'RE GOOD OUT HERE.
WE CAN DO THIS.
LET'S WORK, BRO.
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.
I WOKE UP TODAY, AND I LOOKED
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF MY BAG.
AND, OH, MAN, SOMETHING IS IN
THERE.
IT COULD BE A GOOD THING.
IT COULD BE A BAD THING.
AND SINCE TRIBAL DIDN'T REALLY
GO THE WAY I WAS HOPE, I'M JUST
PRAYING IT'S GOING TO HELP ME IN
THIS GAME.
OH, MY GOD.
MORGAN, MY GIRL, I LOVE YOU.
THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE WILLED TO
ME FROM MY GIRL MORGAN.
JUST, OH, JUST A GREAT MOMENT
FOR ME.
WITH THIS NOTE IN YOUR
POSSESSION, YOU ARE GUARANTEED
IMMUNITY.
YOU MAY ONLY USE IT WITH 13
PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME OR SIX
PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME.
THERE ARE 17 LEFT OF US RIGHT
NOW.
I'LL TAKE ALL THE HELP I CAN
GET.
I WANT EVERY ADVANTAGE I CAN
GET.
THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
BY THESE RELICS.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I REVERSE
THESE CURSES.
I CANNOT GO DOWN AND BE EATEN
ALIVE THE SAME WAY THESE PAST
PLAYERS HAVE BEEN.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
MALOLO GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW NAVITI TRIBE.
MORGAN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
DAMN.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
CHRIS RETURNING FROM GHOST
ISLAND.
CHRIS GETTING HIS FIRST LOOK AT
HIS NEW TRIBE.
HEY THERE.
WHAT'S UP, GUYS.
WELCOME BACK.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL RACE OUT TO
RETRIEVE A RING.
YOU'LL THEN RACE BACK TO YOUR
FLAGPOLE WHILE THE OTHER TRIBE
TRIES TO STOP YOU ANYWAY THEY
CAN.
FIRST PERSON TO HAVE ONE HAND ON
THE RING AND ONE HAND ON THE
FLAGPOLE SCORES A POINT FOR
THEIR TRIBE.
FIRST TO THREE WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
YES.
Jeff: A LITTLE TASTE OF
HOME.
OH.
Jeff: PEANUT BUTTER, JELLY,
AND ICE, COLD MILK.
I WANT THAT SO BAD.
I MIGHT CRY.
Jeff: IN ADDITION, THE
WINNING TRIBE WILL SEND SOMEBODY
FROM THE LOSING TRIBE TO GHOST
ISLAND.
THEY WILL RETURN IN TIME FOR THE
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, AND
THEY WILL FACE THE POSSIBILITY
OF TRIBAL.
A LOT AT STAKE.
MALOLO, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
PERSON.
SITTING SOMEBODY OUT.
YOU CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME
PERSON IN BACK-TO-BACK
CHALLENGES WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO
SIT OUT?
I'M SITTING.
Jeff: CHELSEA GOING TO SIT
THIS ONE OUT.
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A SPOT ON
THE BENCH, TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE, AND WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST ROUND IS GOING TO BE
MICHAEL AND BRENDAN FOR MALOLO
TAKING ON CHRIS AND WENDELL.
HEAD ON OUT, GUYS.
LET'S GO.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
CHRIS GOING TO SWIM OUT QUICKLY.
NOBODY ELSE MOVING.
INTERESTING STRATEGY STRAIGHT
OUT OF THE GATE.
CHRIS QUICKLY GETS TO THE RING.
NOW THE STRATEGY COMES INTO
PLAY.
GO, MICHAEL.
Jeff: CHRIS TRIES TO TOSS
IT TO WENDELL.
BACK TO CHRIS.
WENDELL NOW TRYING TO TIE UP
BRENDAN.
IF CHRIS CAN GET FREE.
CAN ANYBODY STOP CHRIS OUT OF
THE GATE?
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT.
NAVITI SCORES FIRST POINT.
AND ANAVITI LEADS 1-0.
NEXT ROUND, ANGELA AND LAUREL
TAKING ON JENNA AND KELLYN.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!

LAUREL'S GOING TO HEAD OUT THE

WE GOT A BATTLE IN THE WATER
RIGHT NOW.
HERE COMES KELLYN AND ANGELA.
KELLYN NOW GETS ON LAUREL.
ANGELA IS NOW ON THE RING.
EVERYBODY FIGHTING FOR THIS.
LAUREL HAS NOT GIVEN UP FOR A
MOMENT DESPITE EVERYBODY HANGING
ON HER NOW THEY'RE PULLING HER
AWAY.
JENNA NOW STARTING TO DIG IN.
YOU CAN FEEL IT SHIFTING.
LAUREL DIGS BACK IN.
ANGELA DIGS IN.
NOW IT'S ANGELA.
AND SHE'S GOT IT FOR NAVITI.
NAVITI LEADS 2-0.
NEXT ROUND IS GOING TO BE
BRADLEY AND SEBASTIAN TAKING ON
DOMENICK AND JAMES.
NAVITI LEADS 2-0.
PLAYING TO THREE.
NAVITI COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS TIME SEBASTIAN IS HEADING
OUT QUICKLY FOR MALOLO.
DOMENICK IS HEADING OUT FOR
NAVITI.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE AT
THE RING.
SEBASTIAN GETS THERE FIRST.
HE TAKES OFF, AND HE LAUNCHES IT
TO BRADLEY, WHO HAS IT.
HE'S TIED UP NOW.
NOW IT'S MALOLO THAT HAS THE
MOMENTUM.
MALOLO.
JAMES NOW GETTING INTO IT.
IT'S GETTING VERY PHYSICAL.
COME ON, JAMES.
Jeff: IT IS BRADLEY AND
SEBASTIAN PULLING JAMES AND
DOMENICK CLOSER TO THEIR FLAG.
SEBASTIAN AND BRADLEY, CAN THEY
GET THERE?
YES!
MALOLO SCORES.
IT IS 2-1 NAVITI.
NEXT ROUND, DESIREE AND
STEPHANIE TAKING ON LIBBY AND
LAUREL.
NAVITI LEADS 2-1.
WE'RE PLAYING THE THREE.
THIS COULD DO IT FOR NAVITI
RIGHT HERE.
MALOLO MUST SCORE.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
LET'S GO, LADIES.
COME ON, LAUREL.
COME ON, LAUREL.
Jeff: LAUREL FOR THE SECOND
TIME SWIMMING OUT FOR THE RING.
SHE'S DIGGING ON RESERVES RIGHT
NOW.
STEPHANIE GETS TO THE RING
FIRST.
IT'S A BATTLE JUST FOR THE RING.
LIBBY TYING UP DESIREE.
MALOLO NEEDS TO SCORE RIGHT
HERE.
RIGHT NOW NAVITI HAS THE EDGE.
AND THEY INCH THEIR WAY CLOSER
TO THAT FINAL POINT IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
LAUREL HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE
FOR NAVITI.
SHE'S BEEN UNSTOPPABLE.
WATCH THE NECK!
HER FEET!
HER FEET!
Jeff: MALOLO MAKING NAVITI
EARN IT.
LIBBY GETTING CLOSER.
LAUREL FINDING NEW ENERGY.
STEPHANIE PULLING THEM BACK NOW.
LAUREL CONTINUES THE FIGHT.
LIBBY WITHIN INCHES FOR THE WIN.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
LIBBY!
Jeff: NO.
LIBBY PULLS AWAY.
SHE TAKES IT TO THE FLAGPOLE.
YOU GOT IT, YOU GO IT!
Jeff: THERE IT IS.
NAVITI WINS REWARD.
WE'RE GOING TO EAT TONIGHT.
NAVITI, BIG REWARD AND A BIG
DECISION WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO
SEND FROM MALOLO TO GHOST ISLAND
KNOWING THEY WILL RETURN IN TIME
FOR NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A
CONSENSUS AND GO TO ROCKS.
Jeff: GOT IT.
DON'T LOOK.
MY BIGGEST "SURVIVOR" FEAR.
Jeff: IS IT REALLY?
IF THE SPIRITS ARE LISTENING,
YOU MAY BE HEADED TO GHOST.
EVERYBODY PALM UP.
THERE YOU GO.
AND REVEAL.
KELLYN.
KELLYN, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
I OPENED MY MOUTH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Jeff: IS THAT JUST
COINCIDENCE?
NO.
NONE OF US ARE HERE BY
COINCIDENCE.
WE'RE ALL MEANT TO BE HERE, AND
I BETTER BE CAREFUL WHAT I WISH
FOR.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
KELLYN, GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD
ON OUT THE GHOST ISLAND.
Jeff: SEE YOU, KELLYN.
YOU WILL RETURN IN TIME FOR NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
Jeff: SEE YOU, KELLYN.
ALL RIGHT, NAVITI, BIG WIN.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, GRAB YOUR
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP AND ENJOY.
MALOLO, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
THANKS, JEFF.
COME ON, "SURVIVOR" GODS, I
FREAKIN' KNEW THEY HEARD ME.
PART OF ME IS SCARED, BUT I ALSO
FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHERE I'M
MEANT TO BE.
THIS IS MY BIGGEST "SURVIVOR"
FEAR, TO BE OUT ON THE ISLAND BY
MYSELF.
I CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING WHEN
I HAVE PEOPLE AROUND TO TALK
WITH.
I'M AN EXTROVERT.
MY GAME OUT HERE IS A SOCIAL
GAME.
BUT HERE NOW THAT I'M ALONE, I'M
TRYING TO NOT LET THE WHOLE IDEA
OF GHOST ISLAND GET TO ME, SO
I'M TRYING TO CONTROL MY
THOUGHTS.
AND JUST BE -- SEE WHAT'S
WAITING FOR ME.
GAME ON.
FOLLOW THE FIRE.
I SEE THAT I HAVE TO GO PLAY
SOME GAME.
MY MIND STARTS RATIONING.
I AM BEING WALKED INTO THE FIRE.
NOT THE GREATEST FEELING THEY'VE
HAD OUT HERE.
GHOST ISLAND GAME OF CHANCE.
I'LL WAGER A SECRET ADVANTAGE IF
YOU'LL WAGER YOUR NEXT VOTE.
IF YOU WIN, YOU WILL HAVE THE
POWER IN THE GAME.
IF YOU LOSE, YOU WILL NOT VOTE
AT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
UGH.
I AM FEELING SICK TO MY STOMACH.
RIGHT NOW MALOLO SITS AT FIVE
ORIGINAL NAVITI AND FOUR MALOLO.
IF I LOSE, WE LOSE THE NUMBERS.
SO IT IS A HUGE RISK TO GIVE UP
THAT VOTE.
WOULD THE "SURVIVOR" GODS HAVE
GIVEN ME THE WHITE ROCK IF I
WASN'T SUPPOSE TO COME OUT HERE
AND GET THE ADVANTAGE?
IN THIS GAME ONE BAD DECISION
CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOU JUST
HAVE TO TRUST YOUR GUT.
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING.
BUT I JUST CANNOT PLAY THE GAME.
I'M GOING TO KEEP MY VOTE FOR
THE NEXT TRIBAL.
GHOST ISLAND IS ALL ABOUT BEING
HAUNTEDDED BY TERRIBLE
DECISIONS.
AND IT MAKES ME WONDER IF I'VE
DONE THE RIGHT THING.
I'M NOT SURE.
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES
BACK, I CAN LIVE WITH MYSELF
KNOWING THAT I JUST DID WHAT I
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
AND IT'S JUST CRAZY HOW QUICKLY
THIS GAME JUST, LIKE, WEAVES IN
WITH WHO YOU ARE AND WHO YOU
WANT TO BE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO
GO.
I'VE BEEN BLIND SIDED IN MY
PERSONAL LIFE LIKE SO MANY
TIMES, SO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS,
I RALLY CHANGED MY LIFE BY
TRYING TO MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISION, BY TRUFORTING MY GUT.
I JUST GOT MARRIED AND DECIDED
TO NOT BE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP
ANYMORE.
I CHANGED MY CAREER PATH.
I WENT BACK THE GRAD SCHOOL, GOT
AN MBA AND GOT A NEW GREAT JOB.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF I
HADN'T TRUSTED MY GUT, I
WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE TODAY.
I BELIEVE STICKING TO WHO YOU
ARE AT THE CORE AND TRUSTING
YOUR GUT CAN GET YOU FURTHER IN
THIS GAME.
YOU BROUGHT THE FOOD HOME,
GIRL.
YOU!
HELL, YEAH.
MMM.
OH, MY GOD.
MMM.
MMMM.
WELCOME HOME, CHRIS.
IT WAS SO COLD ON THAT ISLAND.
DID YOU GET TO PLAY THE GAME.
NO.
WHEN I WAS SENT TO GHOST ISLAND,
I HAD THIS PLAN IN THE WORKINGS
TO BLIND SIDE COME.
I'M EATING THIS SANDWICH LIKE
I'M GOING TO THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
TOMORROW.
BUT THEY CHOSE MORGAN.
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
SO LET ME HEAR EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.
MY OWN FAMILY SLIT MY THROAT.
ALL THREE OF MY MEMBERS VOTED
FOR ME.
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE TRYING TO
MAKE ME OUT IF THEY'RE TRYING
THE TAKE YOU OUT.
WENDELL AND DOM WENT FOR ANGELA,
BECAUSE THEY WANTED POWER AWAY
FROM ME.
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
LOOK, IF WE FLIP WITH YOU AND ME
AND THOSE FOUR, WE'RE 6-2, AND
IT'S GOING TO BE DOM OR WENDELL.
TO ME IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
JUMP IN WITH THE MALOLOS.
WE HAVE THE VOTES, 3-3.
YOU THINK HE HAS THE IDOL.
HE SHOWED US THE FAKE ONE
WITH A SEASHELL ON A STRING.
IT'S A STRING WITH A SHELL.
I TOLD YOU GUY HE'S A MASTER
MANIPULATOR.
IT'S LIKE CHRIS VERSUS
DOMENICK RIGHT NOW.
THOSE TWO ARE DEFINITELY LIKE
BUTTING HEADS.
I LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU, I
LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU, AND I LIKE
MYSELF.
CHRIS IS WANTING US ON HIS
SIDE TO GET DOMENICK OUT BECAUSE
HE'S GOT AN IDOL.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE OR
NOT, BUT THAT'S WHAT HE'S
FEEDING US.
THEY'RE WATCHING TO SPLIT THE
VOTE.
IN CASE COME HAS AN IDOL.
AND WENDELL WOULD GO.
WENDELL WOULD GO.
Jeff: DO YOU LIKE WENDELL?
I GET ALONG WITH HIM BETTER
THAN CHRIS OR CHRIS BETTER THAN
WENDELL?
I LIKE WENDELL BETTER THAN
CHRIS.
I KNOW.
YOU DON'T WANT WENDELL TO GO.
IT WOULD BE EASY TO SIDE WITH
CHRIS TO GET DOMENICK AND
WENDELL OUT.
I DON'T LOVE THE IDEA WORKING
WITH HIM.
I DON'T WANT CHRIS CALLING THE
SHOTS AROUND HERE EITHER.
THAT'S THE THING.
HE'S DEFINITELY TRYING TO
DICTATE WHAT WE ALL SHOULD DO,
YOU KNOW?
IN REAL LIFE I WENT THE YALE
UNIVERSITY.
I WAS ALSO DIVISION ONE ATHLETE.
I LIKE TO CALL THE SHOTS.
BUT HERE IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING UNDER THE
RADAR, BUT I WANT THAT TO
CHANGE.
I WANT TO HAVE MY NAME ON THE
GAME.
I DON'T WANT YOU GOING ANYWHERE,
AND I DON'T WANT WENDELL TO GO
HOME EITHER.
WE HAVE TO HASH IT OUT.
AMEN.
THE PROBLEM IS THE WHOLE THING.
I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT
BY NOW, AND HE'S STILL HERE.
HE'S STILL HERE.
I LOVE YOU AND WENDELL.
I WOULD RATHER WORK WITH YOU
GUYS.
THREE IS STILL A GOOD NUMBER
IF YOU HAVE TOOLS TO USE THEM
WITH, AND I HAVE A TOOL.
YOU DO?
I DO.
I HAVE THE IDOL.
SO IT'S TRUE?
SO YOU DID LIE TO US.
IT'S AN IDOL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL
PEOPLE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU PLAY IT
YESTERDAY.
YOU HAD ME FOOLED.
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE I WANT
TO WORK WITH YOU.
I KNOW YOU WANT CHRIS OUT.
HELL, YES.
IT'S YOU, ME, WENDELL.
FOR SURE.
Jeff: I THINK DONATHAN
WOULD GO CHRIS.
IF IT WAS CHRIS, I I WOULD
MAKE A MOVE ON HIM.
WE COULD OPEN UP THIS GAME.
LOVE IT.
I LOVE THAT YOU LOVE IT.
LAUREL SURPRISED THE HELL OUT
OF ME.
SHE'S HERE THE PLAY AND PLAY
HARD.
THE ONLY PERSON I THOUGHT I HAD
OUT HERE WAS WENDELL.
NOW TO KNOW THAT LAUREL AND
DONATHAN ARE WILLING TO WORK
WITH US TO GET CHRIS OUT, THAT'S
SUCH A HUGE TURN IN THIS GAME.
IT'S GREAT, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS, FIRST,
MALOLO, I'VE GOT THE TAKE BACK
THE IDOL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO SWIM OUT TO A BAMBOO CAGE.
YOU'LL CLIMB OVER, DIVE DOWN AND
UNTIE A DOOR.
YOU'LL THEN DRAG A HEAVY CHEST
BACK TO SHORE AND ACROSS THE
TRACK.
YOU'LL THEN USE A ROPE TO HOOK
THE MISSING PIECE OF YOUR TRACK,
RECONNECTED IT, AND CONTINUE
MOVING YOUR CHEST.
ONCE YOU REACH THE FINISH,
YOU'LL USE THE BALLS INSIDE,
ATTEMPTING TO LAND THEM ON A
VERY NARROW PERCH.
FIRST TRIBE TO GET ALL FIVE WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF GHOST
ISLAND.
MALOLO, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
PERSON.
YOU HAVE TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
ME.
Jeff: DESIREE, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE SIT-OUT BENCH.
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
IT IS A SPRINT TO THE CAGE.
CHRIS AND WENDELL OUT QUICKLY.
MICHAEL.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET TO THE
CAGE BEFORE ANYBODY CAN HEAD
OVER.
CHRIS AND MICHAEL GET TO THE
CAGE FOR THEIR TRIBE.
CHELSEA IS THERE.
GO, MALOLO.
GO, NAVITI.
NOW OF YOU GOT TO GET UP AND
OVER AND START UNTYING THE DOOR
TO THAT CAGE.
MALOLO HAS THEIR DOOR FREE.
MALOLO NOW CAN START WORKING ON
DRAGGING THAT CHEST, WHICH IS
VERY HEAVY.
NAVITI LOSING A LOT OF TIME ON
THE DOOR.
MALL IS NOW THROUGH THE DOOR.
THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS.
NAVITI STILL STRUGGLING WITH
THEIR DOOR.
THIS IS A BIG TIME ADVANTAGE
EARLY IN THIS CHALLENGE FOR
MALOLO.
NAVITI FINALLY HAS THEIR DOOR
RELEASED.
NOW THEY CAN START MOVING THEIR
CHEST.
MALOLO WITH A BIG LEAD.
COME ON, GUYS!
Jeff: HERE COMES NAVITI.
NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO GET SOME
MOMENTUM.
MALOLO'S GOT IT UP ON THE TRACK.
ONE, TWO, THREE, PUSH!
Jeff: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
NAVITI REACHES SHORE NOW.
THEY'RE TRYING HARD TO CLOSE
THAT GAP.
MALOLO IS NOW UP ON THE TRACK.
NOW OF YOU GOT TO CATCH THAT
CENTER SECTION OF TRACK AND PULL
IT BACK TO YOU.
SEBASTIAN HOOKS THE TRACK.
NOW IT'S TEAMWORK TO PULL THE
TRACK BACK INTO PLACE SO YOU CAN
CONTINUE.
THERE THEY GO.
YOU'RE GOOD.
GET RID OF THAT ROPE.
YOU GOT TO GET ON THE TRACK I
THINK.
ON THE TRACK, ON THE TRACK.
Jeff: HERE COMES NAVITI.
YOU HAVE TO GET ON TRACK.
IF YOU'RE OFF TRACK, IT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK.
NAVITI ONE STEP BECOME AFTER
ANOTHER IN THIS CHALLENGE.
HUGE TIME ADVANTAGE FOR MALOLO.
MALOLO, GET IT ON YOUR PLATFORM.
WATCH OUT, MICHAEL.
Jeff: MALOLO NOW UNTYING
KNOTS TO RELEASE THE BALLS THEY
NEED TO FINISH THIS CHALLENGE.
IT'S SEBASTIAN AND BRENDAN NOW
TOSSING BALLS FOR MALL MALL.
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.
Jeff: WENDELL WILL TRY THE
GRAB THAT TRACK.
MISSES WITH HIS FIRST TOSS.
THAT'S ONE FOR MALOLO.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ALL FIVE BALLS
UP THERE.
COME ON.
Jeff: CHRIS IS GOING TO
TAKE OVER.
NAVITI HAS STRUGGLED FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THIS CHALLENGE.
THAT'S TWO FOR MALOLO.
ANOTHER ONE FOR MALOLO MAKING
THIS A BLOWOUT.
NAVITI CANNOT GET PAST THAT
SECTION OF TRACK.
YOU'RE GOOD, NAVITI.
NAVITI HAS IT IF THEY CAN GET
THAT TRACK BACK AND CATCH
EVERYBODY.
GUYS, YOU HAVE TO HELP, MAN.
Jeff: NAVITI, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED EVERYBODY.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS WITH TWO GUYS.
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE,
HERE.
PUSH THAT ROPE BACK.
Jeff: THERE YOU GO.
NOW NAVITI'S GOT IT.
EASY, EASY, BRENDAN.
Jeff: BRENDAN KNOCKS IT
OFF.
THIS IS THE BREAK NAVITI NEEDS.
YOU GOT TO MOVE, NAVITI.
KEEP MOVE, KEEP MOVING.
LET SEBASTIAN GO.
Jeff: BRENDAN SCORES THE
THIRD.
WE HAVE TO LIFT IT UP HERE.
Jeff: NAVITI HAS GOT THE
MOVE QUICKLY TO GET THIS CHEST
UNTIED.
LET'S GO, ON THE MAT.
NAVITI HAS THEIR BALLS FREE.
IT IS NOW CHRIS AND WENDELL.
IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE COMEBACK.
YOU GOT IT, MALOLO.
Jeff: STAY RELAXED.
EVEN IF THEY START GETTING THEM,
WE'RE FINE.
Jeff: NAVITI SCORES ONE.
IT'S NOW 3-1.
SO CLOSE.
Jeff: BRENDAN LANDS THE
FOURTH.
THIS IS IT.
ACCEPT COULD WIN IT.
SEBASTIAN JUST MISSES.
THAT'S TWO FOR NAVITI.
NAVITI CLOSING THE GAP NOW.
CHRIS HITS ONE BUT WENDELL
KNOCKS ONE OFF.
WENDELL PUTS ANOTHER ONE UP.
IT'S NOW 4-3.
NOW IT'S BRENDAN TRYING TO SCORE
FOR MALOLO.
LET'S GO!
HERE WE GO, GUYS.
Jeff: THEY HAVE THEIR
FOURTH FOR NAVITI.
THIS IS IT.
IT'S A SHOWDOWN.
WHAT A COMEBACK FROM NAVITI TO
BE IN THIS.
IT IS NOW ANYBODY'S GAME.
SEBASTIAN NO.
CHRIS, JUST SHORT.
BRENDAN ON AND OFF.
YES!
Jeff: CHRIS DOES IT.
A HUGE COMEBACK FROM NAVITI.
NAVITI WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
MALOLO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THAT IS A "SURVIVOR" CELEBRATION
RIGHT THERE.
SORRY, SORRY, COME ON.
GET UP HERE.
Jeff: NAVITI, WHAT A
COMEBACK.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
ONE THING "SURVIVOR" DOES OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS
REMIND, YOU NEVER EVER GIVE UP
BECAUSE IT IS NOT OVER UNTIL IT
IS OVER.
YOU PULLED OUT A HUGE
COME-FROM-BEHIND.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
ALL RIGHT.
MALOLO, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
THANK GOD I TRUSTED MY GUT.
I DIDN'T PLAY THE GAME AT GHOST
ISLAND.
I STILL HAVE MY VOTE.
OLD NAVITI IS GOING INTO TRIBAL
TONIGHT WITH THE NUMBERS.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS DECIDE WHO
GOES HOME NEXT.
FOR NINE-TENTHS OF THIS
CHALLENGE, WE CRUSHED THEM.
IT'S GOOD EFFORT.
WE CONFIRMED WHAT I KNOW ABOUT
THIS GROUP, WHICH IS WE'RE
BETTER THAN THEY ARE, WE JUST
DIDN'T CLOSE IT OUT, BUT YOU
GOODNIGHTS WERE REALLY GOOD
TODAY.
AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK FROM
THE IMMUNITY
THE IMMUNITY
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, IT WAS
SOMBER, BUT WE HAVE THE POWER
TONIGHT.
I'M TRYING THE PLAY LIKE BOSTON
ROB, SOMEONE WHO HAS THE NUMBERS
AND IS IN CONTROL.
SO I THINK STONEWALLING THE
ORIGINAL MALOLO PEOPLE IS THE
BEST TACTIC AT THIS POINT.
SPEAK TO ME.
IT'S 5-4.
I KNOW THAT.
I KNOW.
BUT I WANT THE STAY.
WE SHALL SEE.
WE SHALL SEE?
RIGHT NOW I REALLY DON'T THINK
THESE FIVE ARE GOING THE CRACK,
SO IT'S ONE OF US FOUR GOING
HOME TONIGHT, AND THAT'S
FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE I HAVE SO
MUCH NOR GAME LEFT IN ME THE
PLAY.
BEING A SINGLE MOM, I THINK MY
BIGGEST FEAR IS FAILING MY KIDS.
SO I HOPE I'M HERE TO SEE
ANOTHER DAY.
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S OUT OF MY
HANDS.
AND IT MAKES ME SICK THAT
SOMEBODY LIKE BRADLEY IS STILL
GOING TO STAY IN THIS GAME.
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT TIME.
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD NAIL IT
DOWN.
NAIL IT DOWN NOW.
SO DO WE THINK THEY HAVE AN
IDOL?
I DO NOT, BUT WE HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL.
I KNOW WE NEED THE STRENGTH,
BUT IN CASE THEY HAVE ONE, --
I WOULD AGREE.
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE IT
COMING.
YOU NEVER KNOW IF THE
ORIGINAL MALOLO FOUR HAVE A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
SO WE'RE WEST BANKING ON THE
FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
WE WANT THE KEEP STRENGTH AND
VOTE OUT ONE OF THE GIRL, BUT
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT ONE OF
THE GUYS BECAUSE THEY WON'T
EXPECT IT, SO EVEN IF THEY PLAY
THE IDOL, WE WON'T PLAY IT
CORRECTLY?
SO ARE WE DOING CORRECTLY?
IF EVERYBODY'S GOOD WITH
THAT.
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK BRENDAN, BECAUSE I
KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
SUSPECT THAT AT ALL.
BRENDAN IS NOT DANGEROUS.
HE'S DOCILE.
HE'S A LITTLE ANNOYING.
TONIGHT BRENDAN'S AN OPTION
TO TAKE OUT BECAUSE HE DOES LIKE
THE PLAY THAT LEADER ROLE.
HE'S LIKE A DAD WHO GIVES
TERRIBLE PEP TALKS, WHICH IS
FINE.
HE CAN LEAD PEOPLE BECAUSE THE
LEADER NEVER WINS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, MICHAEL'S A
STRONG GUY, AND THEY WON'T SEE
IT COMING.
I'M THINKING ABOUT EVERY SINGLE
DETAIL, THAT'S WHAT I DO, THAT'S
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME A
FANTASTIC LAWYER.
HERE'S THE DEAL, WE'RE ALL SAFE,
KNOCK ON WOOD, AS LONG AS WE
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.
THE GROUP HAS DECIDED TO TAKE
OUT SOME BIG BOYS IN THIS GAME.
MICHAEL AND BRENDAN.
THEY'RE LIKE HELPLESS PENGUINS
ON A TROPICAL ISLAND.
AND THAT KIND OF SCARES ME,
BECAUSE I'M A BIG BOY, TOO, BUT
FOR NOW I'M JUST GOING TO GO
WITH THE FLOW, BECAUSE THE
MALOLO CAN GO NO FURTHER LOW-LOW
THAN THE MALOLO LOW.
HIGH-FIVES ALL AROUND.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK IT'S COMING MY WAY.
THEY'RE IN THE GOING TO YOU.
I FEEL JUST AS PARANOID AS
YOU.
I FEEL LIKE THEY COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT STRENGTH MOVING FORWARD.
THEY MIGHT WANT TO GET OUT
WHOEVER THEY CAN.
AT LEAST WE HAVE AN IDOL.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO
WITH IT?
WE'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT.
HAVING SAID, THAT WE DO HAVE ONE
CARD THE PLAY.
WHICH IS THE IDOL WE FOUND.
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO PULL OUT
THE IDOL TONIGHT, STEPHANIE AND
JEN NEED KNOW IN ADVANCE,
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T, THEY'LL
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ON THE OUTSIDE
LOOKING IN.
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.
I JUST FOUND AN IDOL.
NEW YORK YOU DIDN'T?
YES, DID.
IT'S IN MY BAG RIGHT NOW.
SHUT UP!
IT'S JAMES' ORIGINAL IDOL
FROM "SURVIVOR" CHINA.
WE WENT TO 25% CHANCE.
LET'S ROLL THE DICE.
I WAS OUT HERE MEDITATING FOR
HOPE.
LET'S MAKING SOMETHING
HAPPEN.
WHAT I DO WITH THIS IDOL
COMPLETELY DICTATES MY FUTURE IN
THIS GAME AND MY ALLIANCES.
IT'S GOING TO BE A RISK.
BUT I'M IN THE HERE TO JUST PLAY
AN DOL AND BE SAFE FOR A FEW
MORE DAYS.
WE NEED A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD
LUCK.
THE IDOL IS NOT ENOUGH.
I'M GOING TO PULL IT OUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND
I'M GOING TO SAY, I'M PLAYING
THIS FOR ONE OF THE FOUR OF US.
HOPEFULLY ONE PERSON FLIPS, AND
THE FOUR OF US NEED THE VOTE.
DO YOU AGREE?
I'M GOING TO WRITE --
 LET'S JUST ATTACK HIM.
I THINK TONIGHT A WAR BETWEEN
THESE TWO GROUPS.
WE'RE GUNNING FOR BRADLEY.
WE DEFINITELY HAVE OUR WORK CUT
OUT FOR US WHEN IT COMES TO
TRYING TO FLIP A NUMBER OR.
TWO BUT I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE LIKE ACCEPT
AND CHELSEA THAT THEY'RE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THEIR ALLIANCE.
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY IN MY OPINION
IS JAMES WALKING OUT WITH TWO
IDOLS.
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE TO END THAT
CURSE AND END THAT LEGACY, SO
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A
TRADITIONAL IMMUNITY IDOL, I DO
HAVE A PLAN UP MY SLEEVE TONIGHT
Jeff: IF YOU DON'T ALREADY
HAVE A TORCH, GO AHEAD AND GRAB
ONE, APPROACH THE FLAME, DIP IT
IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
SEBASTIAN, FIRST TIME COMING TO
TRIBAL.
NAVITI HAS THE NUMBERS.
IT WOULD SEEM.
YEAH, TOTALLY.
I MEAN, IT WAS PRETTY IMMEDIATE,
THE FIVE OLD NAVITI KNOW WHAT WE
NEED TO DO, AND I THINK WE'RE
STICKING TO IT PRETTY GOOD.
Jeff: DES, IF THERE ARE
FIVE NAVITI HOLDING STRONG AND
ONLY FOUR MALOLO, WAS IT
UNCOMFORTABLE?
AWKWARD.
THAT'S THE ONLY WORD I CAN USE
TO DESCRIBE IT.
THEY KNOW ONE OF THEM IS GETTING
VOTED OUT.
Jeff: STEPHANIE, WAS THERE
ANY ATTEMPT AT TRYING TO
INFILTRATE THE NAVITI FIVE?
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT BRADLEY DID A GREAT JOB TO
MAKE SURE HE KNEW WHERE EVERYONE
IN HIS LITTLE AHYNES WAS AT ALL
TIMES.
Jeff: BRADLEY, DID YOU
SENSE A LITTLE IRRITATION WHEN
STEPHANIE SAYS "HIS LITTLE
ALLIANCE."
I'VE BEEN SENSING IRRITATION
ALL DAY.
I CAN SEE IT FROM THEIR SIDE,
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
YOU KNOW, I'VE TRIED THE TALK TO
A NUMBER OF THEM.
YOU KNOW, AS A BABYSITTER.
Jeff: SO MICHAEL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT WAS VERY TOUGH TO FIND
IF THERE WAS A CRACK.
FIRST OFF, THE NAVITI FIVE IS
STRONG, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT
HAD TO CHALLENGE THEIR LOYALTY
TO EACH OTHER, BUT THERE
DEFINITELY ARE PEOPLE ON THE
BOTTOM IN THEIR FIVE, AND IT'S
VERY APPARENT THAT IT'S CHELSEA
AND SEBASTIAN.
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE.
BRADLEY IS THE RINGLEADER.
NOW, I'M SURE HE'S MADE YOU ALL
FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL OF YOU, IT'S
A BIG DEMOCRACY, BUT IF I'M
SEBASTIAN, I'M THINKING, WAIT A
SECOND, DO YOU THINK BRADLEY
WANTS TO TAKE YOU FURTHER IN
THIS GAME?
YOU'RE SOCIAL, YOU'RE ATHLETIC,
THERE NIECE CHANCE IN THE WORLD
THAT BRADLEY IS TAKING YOU THAT
FAR.
BUT THIS IS AN AHYNES OF FIVE
OF US.
WE ALL GET ALONG.
WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER, AN WE
ALL INTEND TO PLAY THIS GAME
TOGETHER.
CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING HIM
BELIEVE THAT.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, WHEN YOU
HAVE FOUR PEOPLE SAY, I'M
TELLING YOU WHAT I SEE, IT'S YOU
AND CHELSEA, IS THERE ANY PART
OF YOU THAT SAYS, HUH, THAT IS
INTERESTING?
YEAH, IT'S INTERESTING, YOU
KNOW.
BUT, JEFF, WE KNEW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO THROW SPIT AT
THE WALL, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO
STICK ON US RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE NOT DUMB.
WE KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AT WAR AND
YOUR SIDE IS WINNING, THE CLAWS
HAVE TO COME OUT.
IT'S AN US VERSUS THEM
MENTALITY.
Jeff: BOY, DESIREE, COULD
IT BE THAT SIMPLE?
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S HOW IT IS.
YEAH, I'M SORRY --
 I THINK IT COULD BE THAT
SIMPLE, BUT TONIGHT IT'S NOT.
THIS IS AN IDOL.
IT'S "SURVIVOR: CHINA."
THIS IS JAMES' IDOL.
HE WALKED OUT OF HERE WITH TWO
OF THEM.
I'M NOT GOING TO READ THE WHOLE
STORY, BUT JAMES HAS BEEN CURSED
FOR 11 YEARS FOR NOT PLAYING
EITHER OF HIS IDOLS.
NOW IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO
REVERSE THE CURSE AND THIS HAS
DOUBLE POWER TO SAVE TWO PEOPLE
TONIGHT.
DOUBLE IMMUNITY.
SO I'M PLAYING THIS FOR TWO OF
THE FOUR OF US TONIGHT.
AND I CAN SAY UNANIMOUSLY THE
FOUR OF US, ALL OF OUR VOTES ARE
GOING ON BRADLEY.
AND IF ANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
JUMP, ALL IT TAKES IS ONE VOTE.
TWO VOTES IS FINE.
AND I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS THINK
TWICE ABOUT IT.
Jeff: WOW.
BRADLEY.
YEAH, IT'S TOUGH TO HEAR.
I'M A BIT SURPRISED AS TO HOW I
BECAME THIS BIG THREAT AND
RINGLEADER, BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL
THAT WAY.
BUT THE DID I SEE THAT COMING,
NO?
Jeff: CHELSEA, THIS
DEFINITELY CHANGES THINGS.
YEAH, I MEAN, THIS IS
"SURVIVOR."
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY
GOING ON.
YEAH, THIS OBVIOUSLY MAKES
THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
I'LL SAY.
Jeff: SO SEBASTIAN, IS THIS
REALLY JUST A ROLL OF THE DICE?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO WOULD YOU LAST LONGER
WITH?
WE PEOPLE RESPECT BIG MOVES.
WE'VE MADE IT EASY FOR YOU TO DO
SO.
I CHALLENGE YOU.
I DO AGREE WITH YOU.
CHELSEA, THIS IS AN EXTENDED
ARM TO YOU, AS WELL.
I DON'T BELIEVE IF ANY ONE OF
US SWITCHED OVER THAT WE WOULD
BE ABLE TO WORK OUR WAY IN
SOCIALLY TO BREAK THE BOND THAT
THE FOUR OF THEM HAVE.
THE FOUR OF US AR
TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE NOBODY
ELSE TO LEAN ON.
I'M IN THE SAYING THAT WE'RE THE
STRONGEST FOUR, WE WERE FORCED
TO COME TOGETHER, AND I'M
EXTENDING THE OFFER TO GIVE YOU
GUYS AN OPTION.
Jeff: SO ACCEPT, THIS
REALLY IS COMING DOWN TO WHO HAS
A BETTER READ ON THE OTHER
GROUP.
JUST BASIC GUT, YOU KNOW.
YOU GOT TO PLAY EVERY PART OF
THIS IN YOUR HEAD.
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL THE
OPTIONS.
AND THAT'S HOW I'M PLAYING MY
GAME.
Jeff: I REALLY THINK THAT
TONIGHT MIGHT BE THE NIGHT THAT
YOU GUYS LOOK BACK ONCE YOU'RE
VOTED OUT AND SAY, DAMN, I
REALLY WISH I WOULD HAVE MADE
THAT MOVE.
Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
KELLYN, YOU'RE UP.
I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HEARD
A GROWN MAN WHINE AND COMPLAIN
AS MUCH AS YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JUST
HAPPENED.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS GUY
FOR ME AND BRENDAN.
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO LAY IT
FOR STEPH.
Jeff: OKAY.
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR STEPHANIE
WILL NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, BRADLEY.
BRADLEY.
BRADLEY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES BRADLEY.
BRADLEY.
FOUR VOTES BRADLEY.
BRENDAN.
ONE VOTE BRENDAN.
BRENDAN.
BRENDAN.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES BRADLEY, THREE
VOTES BRENDAN.
BRENDAN.
WE'RE TIED.
FOUR VOTES BRENDAN, FOUR BROATS
BRADLEY, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND,"
BRENDAN.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JENNA, MICHAEL, STEPH, KEEP
PRESSING.
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
BRENDAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
THANKS, JEFF.
Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, THAT WAS A "SURVIVOR"
SHOWDOWN.
NAVITI WON THIS ROUND, BUT THE
QUESTION IS, CAN THIS TRIBE
RECOVER SO YOU DON'T COME BACK
HERE AGAIN?
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," BUILDING STRONG
BONDS...
AS LONG AS SHE KEEPS FLIRTING
WITH ME, SHE'S STAYING THIS THIS
GAME.
I RESPECT YOU.
I BONDED WITH CHRIS.
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE HERE.
Jeff: KEEP YOUR HEAD ABOVE
WATER.
IS SHE ON THERE?
Jeff: WOW!
I'M BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED.
THE OUTCOME IS WHAT WE WANTED AS
A GROUP OF FOUR.
THAT HAPPENS IN LIFE.
SOMETIMES THE BALL BOUNCES YOUR
WAY, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.
BUT WE WENT OUT SWINGING.
AFTER 16 YEARS TRYING TO GET
HERE, IT'S A TOUGH PILL TO
SWALLOW, BUT IT'S RARE IN LIFE
THAT AN EXPERIENCE LIVES UP TO
EXPECTATIONS.
THIS ONE DID.
IT'S BEEN A THRILL, AN I'M JUST
IS THANKFUL FOR EVERY MINUTE I
SPEND OUT HERE.
