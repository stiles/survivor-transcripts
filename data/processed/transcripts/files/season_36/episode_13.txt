        Jeff: WELCOME TO THE FINALE
OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."
IT HAS BEEN SUCH A FUN SEASON.
TONIGHT WE CROWN A WINNER.
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF GAME
LEFT TO BE PLAYED, I CAN
GUARANTEE YOU THAT.
LET'S SAY HELLO TO THE STARS OF
THIS SEASON OVER HERE, THE EARLY
BLIND SIDES, THEY'RE TOUGH.
WE LOST SOME GOOD PLAYERS
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.
OVER HERE, OUR JURY SO FAR, WE
HAVE CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE,
JENNA, MICHAEL, CHELSEA, AND
KELLYN.
AND DOWN HERE, OUR FINAL SIX
STILL IN THE GAME, SEBASTIAN,








DOMENICK, DONATHAN, WENDELL,
ANGELA, AND LAUREL.
THREE OF THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO
BE VOTED OUT AND GO TO THE JURY.
THREE OF THEM WILL MAKE IT TO
THE END WITH A SHOT TO WIND.
WE ARE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
IT'S "SURVIVOR" FINALE NIGHT.
I LOVE FINALES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.
HAVE A SEAT.
I LOVE THE LOVE.
SO LOOK, GHOST ISLAND,
ADMITTEDLY A BIG, SOME WOULD SAY
CORNY, IDEA.
THE PLAYERS EMBRACED IT.








YOU GUYS EMBRACED IT.
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT, WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AT 8:00, "SURVIVOR" IS THE
MOST-WATCHED SHOW OF THE SEASON.
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE 18 YEARS AND 36 SEASONS,
THAT'S DUE TO YOUR LOYALTY.
OKAY.
PARENTS, I JUST WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR LETTING THE KIDS
STAY UP LATE TONIGHT.
I KNOW IT'S A BIG DEAL, AND
KIDS, YOU GOT TO DO YOUR PART,
THE MINUTE THE SHOW IS OVER, YOU
HAVE TO GO TO BED, OTHERWISE
THEY WON'T LET YOU DO IT NEXT
TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
IT'S THE FINALE, "SURVIVOR:
GHOST ISLAND."
35 DAYS AGO THESE 20 AMERICANS
WERE ABANDONED IN THE ISLANDS OF
FIJI TO TAKE PART IN THE
GREATEST SOCIAL EXPERIMENT ON
TELEVISION.
NOW ONLY SIX PLAYERS REMAIN.
SEBASTIAN.
FOR 35 DAYS HE HAS PLAYED ONLY
WITH HIS HEART.
I'M HAPPY, SMILEY, GIGY,
PIECE OF LAFFEY TAFFY, BANANA
FLAVORED.
Jeff: BUT NOW WITH AN EXTRA
VOTE ALREADY MISPLAYED ONCE THIS
SEASON BY KELLYN --
 OH, HELL, YEAH.
Jeff: -- HE'S POISED TO
MAKE HIS FIRST BIG STRATEGIC
MOVE IN THE GAME.
CAN HE REVERSE THE CURSE?
THERE'S SO MUCH ADRENALINE
RUSHING THROUGH MY BODY.
YOU KNOW, MY CHEST IS...
EVERYTHING IN MY HEART IS GOING
TO GO INTO WINNING THIS GAME.
Jeff: DONATHAN, HE STARTED
THE GAME A FISH OUT OF WATER BUT
QUICKLY ADAPTED, BECOMING PART
OF A STRONG FOUR-PERSON
ALLIANCE.
SO IT'S YOU, ME, WENDELL AND
DONATHAN.
WE CAN OPEN THIS GAME UP.
Jeff: AS HE ENTERS THE
FINAL PHASE, HIS GAME CENTERS
AROUND TRUTH BOMBS.
DOMENICK'S GOING TO BE HARD
THE BEAT AT THE END.
I'M NOT VOTING FOR YOU IF YOU
AND HIM SIT THERE.
I'M VOTING FOR DOM.
Jeff: AND CAUSING CHAOS AT
CAMP AND TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU HAVE SOME DESIRE THE
SPEW --
WHEN I'M WORKING WITH PEOPLE,
I NEED TO BE TRUTHFUL WITH THEM.
I'M GOING TO BE BLUNT ABOUT IT.
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
NO.
Jeff: WILL THEY BE HIS
TICKET TO THE END?
I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT
THIS POINT.
IF IT GETS ME TO DAY 39, I'LL
HAVE A GREAT STORY TO TELL FOR
THE JURY.
Jeff: LAUREL, SHE HAS BUILT
STRONG BONDS ACROSS TRIBAL
LINES.
I LOVE YOU AND WENDELL.
I WOULD RATHER WORK WITH YOU
GUYS.
Jeff: AND SHOWN UNWAVERING
LOYALTY.
ARE YOU 1,000% TOP FOUR WITH
US?
YES.
Jeff: BUT WITH THE END IN
SIGHT, SHE HAS A BIG DECISION,
STICK WITH THE ALLIANCE THAT GOT
HER THIS FAR OR CUT TIES AND
SPRINT TO THE END?
IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN $1 MILLION AND A SEAT ON
THE JURY.
WHILE IT'S BEEN GREAT TO WORK
OF THE GAME, NOW IT'S THE FINISH
PHASE.
THIS IS WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO.
NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE.
Jeff: ANGELA, THIS WAR
VETERAN HAS BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE
OF NEARLY EVERY VOTE.
KELLYN, THAT'S THREE, THAT'S
ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
Jeff:BUT SHE NOW FINDS HERSEL
POSITION OF BEING A POSSIBLE
SWING VOTE.
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC.
NO THIS COULD BE THE BREAK SHE
NEEDS TO GET HERSELF TO THE END
AND A SHOT AT THE MONEY.
I FEEL THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT THAN MOST PEOPLE HERE.
THEY'RE MAKING THESE
CONNECTIONS.
THEY'RE MAKING ALL THESE LOYAL
BONDS, BUT I SEE THEM ALMOST AS
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.
I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS.
I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE BONDS.
I'M HERE TO WIN $1 MILLION.
Jeff: WENDELL, HIS
LAID-BACK STYLE MASKS A CLEVER
SOCIAL GAME AND HIS PARTNERSHIP
WITH DOM HAS OFFERED PROTECTION.
IF WE GO AT EACH OTHER, WE'RE
BOTH GOING TO DIE OUT HERE.
YES.
Jeff: BUT WITH A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND $1 MILLION ON
THE LINE, HE'S A CLEAR THREAT TO
WIN, AND EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO
TAKE HIM OUT.
I'VE HAD MY HANDS ON THE
WHEEL, AND I'VE BEEN DRIVING
THIS THING.
NOW IT'S REALLY THE END.
THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL.
I'M GOING TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO
THIS.
IT'S GOING TO BE A SLUG FIGHT.
Jeff: DOMENICK, HIS BRASH
STYLE RUBBED SOME THE WRONG WAY.
THESON OF A BITCH WANTS ME
DEAD.
HE'S GOT TO GO.
Jeff: BUT HIS GAME PLAY HAS
BEEN WILL BE TRICK.
I STILL THINK WE SHOULD DO
KELLYN BEFORE DONATHAN.
Jeff: WITH REAL IDOL AND A
FAKE IDOL, HE HAS THE TOOLS TO
MAKE MOVES.
YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN POWER
LICE IN THE ABILITY TO USE THIS
FAKE IDOL THE FOOL ANOTHER
PLAYER.
Jeff: BUT HIS PARTNERSHIP
WITH WENDELL MAY BE HIS BIGGEST
OBSTACLE.
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M GOING TO
KICK SOME ASS AT FINAL TRIBAL IF
I GET.
THERE IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER
CHALLENGE, ANOTHER THING I NEED
TO OVERCOME AND SEE IF I REALLY
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT THE
BEST OUT HERE.
SNOW AND WITH ONE LAST VISIT TO
GHOST ISLAND AND ONE FINAL $1
MILLION DECISION TO BE MADE,
THIS GAME IS STILL FAR FROM
OVER.
WHO WILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, AND OUTLAST ALL
THE REST TO CLAIM THE $1 MILLION
PRIZE AND THE TITLE OF SOLE
"SURVIVOR"?
Captioning funded by CBS
THAT WAS A FUN ONE.
THAT WAS A BARN BURNER I
THOUGHT.
AT TRIBAL DONATHAN WENT
BANANAS.
HE ALMOST SAID, LOOK, I'M
DECLARING WAR ON YOU GUYS, AND I
DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS
ALINES MOVING FORWARD.
IF HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME HE
WAS VOTING AGAINST YOU, I COULD
HAVE GOT YOU OFF OF THERE.
SHOULD HAVE TOOK YOUR SHOT.
IT'S JUST SUCH A WACKY
SITUATION BECAUSE A FEW MINUTES
AGO I FEEL LIKE THE GUY WAS
WORKING WITH US AND NOW HE'S
STICKING IS SWORD IN THE SAND
AND HE'S SAYING, I'M READY TO
GO.
YOU ALMOST VOTED YOURSELF OUT
OF THE GAME.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY KEPT ME
TONIGHT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
THEY WOULD HAVE VOTED YOU OUT
TONIGHT IF THEY WANTED TO.
THEY DIDN'T.
I WAS NERVOUS TONIGHT, AND I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
I SEEN MY NAME.
SO GOING INTO TOMORROW I'M STILL
NERVOUS BECAUSE I DID KIND OF
BLOW THEIR GAMES UP TONIGHT, SO
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
WORK WITH ME NO MORE, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DEALING
WITH I GUESS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE VOTING
DONATHAN.
THAT'S WHY I WAS LIKE WHAT
THE... SO FAR I'VE BEEN HIDING
BEHIND THE SHELTER OF THE BIG
BOYS, LETTING THEM CALL THE
SHOTS.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M
GETTING SICK OF IT.
I'M A BIG BOY, TOO.
SO I GOT THIS LITTLE VACK IN --
ADVANTAGE IN MY POCKET, WHICH IS
AN EXTRA VOTE.
I'M JUST TIRED OF BEING IN THEIR
SHADOW.
SO IT MIGHT BE TIME TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE.
OKAY.
HERE'S THE ISSUE: 24 HOURS AGO
WE HAD DONATHAN VOTING WITH US.
I WANTED TO LET DON-DON HAVE
IT, MAN.
YEAH.
I STILL DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE
HIM NEXT.
WE KNOW WHO IT NEEDS TO BE NEXT.
LOOK, I'M 100% ON BOARD.
I WAS THINKING THAT ALL NIGHT.
DONATHAN IS NO THREAT IN ANY
WAY.
NO.
DOM AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER BUT AT THE SAME TIME
TRYING TO GET RID OF EACH OTHER,
BUT WE BOTH HAVE IDOLS IN OUR
POCKET, WHICH MAKES IT VERY
DIFFICULT.
SO NEXT BEST OPTION MIGHT BE
SEBASTIAN, WHO HAS PLAYED A
CLEAN, FAIR GAME.
EVERYBODY LOVES HIM.
VERY ATHLETIC.
HE CAN WIN CHALLENGES, WHICH
MAKES HIM A BIG THREAT.
WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO
TODAY.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT
ALL OUT THERE.
IF YOU WIN TODAY, WE'RE BOTH
SAFE.
BOOM.
EXACTLY.
IF HE DOESN'T WIN, IT MIGHT
BE A TRUE BLIND SIDE.
IF HE DOESN'T WIN, IT MIGHT
BE A TRUE BLIND SIDE.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT THE HELL?
Jeff: THE EXPRESSIONS ON
YOUR FACES AS YOU TAKE IN ONE OF
THE BIGGEST MAZES WE'VE EVER
DONE ON "SURVIVOR."
ALL RIGHT.
SHALG WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
LAUREL, I HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE
NECKLACE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jeff: THANK YOU.
YEP.
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE THROUGH A GIANT
MAZE COLLECTING BAGS OF PUZZLE
PIECES ALONG THE WAY.
ONCE YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE
BAGS, YOU'LL USE THE PIECES
INSIDE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE AT TRIBAL, GUARANTEED A ONE
IN FIVE SHOT AT GETTING TO THE
END.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.
OH.
WE ALWAYS LIKE, THAT JEFF.
Jeff: THE WINNER OF THIS
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE WAITING BACK
AT CAMP STEAK DINNER, BAKED
POTATO, BREAD, DESSERT.
BIG STAKES.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
YOU LIKE THAT?
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
WE'RE EACH COLLECTING THREE BAGS
OF PUZZLE PIECES IN THE BIGGEST
MAZE EVER DONE ON "SURVIVOR."
GOOD LUCK.

THESE INITIAL PIECES TAKE SOME
EXPERIMENTING.

I THINK I'VE GOT IT.
Jeff: WENDELL WINS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, SAFE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, GUARANTEED A
SPOT IN THE FINAL FIVE.
WENDELL, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE CLUB, BROTHER.
WENDELL, YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN, GUARANTEES YOU A
SPOT IN THE FINAL FIVE.
YOU WILL NOT BE VOTED OUT
TONIGHT.
YOU HAVE A STEAK DINNER WAITING
FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU.
YOU WILL BE REWARDING SOMEBODY
AND FUELING YOUR COMPETITION AT
THE SAME TIME.
I GOT TO REPAY THE FAVOR.
SEBASTIAN, COME ON.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, COME ON
OVER.
THANKS, BUDDY.
Jeff: ABSOLUTELY, BRO.
GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS ENOUGH
STEAK FOR ONE MORE PERSON.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CHOOSE?
MY THOUGHT IS THAT I KIND OF
WANT TO SHARE THE WEALTH A
LITTLE BIT.
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PICK
ANG.
Jeff: ANGELA, COME ON OVER.
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
ABSOLUTELY.
SHE DESERVES IT, MAN.
Jeff: LAUREL, EXPLAIN THE
DYNAMIC.
SOME HAVE HAD FOOD, SOME
HAVEN'T.
THOSE WHO ARE NOT ARE GOING TO
GET IT.
DO YOU BUY IT?
I THINK WENDELL IS A
COMPETITOR, SO I FIND IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE THAT'S HIS REASON.
IT SEEMS LIKE A STRATEGIC MOVE,
THE PEOPLE HE WANTS THE FUEL UP,
BUT WHO KNOWS.
Jeff: HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN, WENDELL, SEBASTIAN,
ANGELA, YOU GO BACK THE CAMP.
STEAK DINNER FOR YOU.
DONATHAN, LAUREL, DOMENICK,
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT ON TRIBAL.
I'M LIVED, WENDELL WINS THE
ARE MY BIGGEST ENEMIES.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY
AHYNES.
THE GLOVES ARE OFF NOW AND I'M
COMING AFTER THEM.
Jeff: WENDELL, FIRST
VICTORY, BUDDY.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?
YOU WERE ON MY HEELS.
I HAD TO LET YOU HAVE ONE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL YOU
DO THESE PUZZLES SO FREAKIN'
FAST.
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
I FINALLY WON INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
IT FEELS GREAT.
I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF
MYSELF, BUT I'M AT LEAST
GUARANTEED IF I USE THIS AND I
USE MY IDOL TO BE IN THE TOP
FOUR, AND THAT FEELS SO GREAT.
ON TOP OF, THAT I GET TO FEAST.
WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT GOOD.
I THINK I LITERALLY JUST
DROOLED.
THANK YOU, WENDELL.
THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING
AMAZING PEOPLE.
I FEEL HORRIBLE THAT I MIGHT
BLINDSIDE SEA BASS TONIGHT, AND
I STILL WANT TO CURRY FAVOR WITH
HIM BEFORE I SEND HIM TO THE
JURY SO HE HAS A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT ME.
EASY VOTE DOM TONIGHT.
100% DOM TONIGHT.
HE'S NOT THE SAME WHEN HE
STARTED.
ABSOLUTELY.
HE STARTED WITH A GREAT STORY.
I DON'T THINK HE COULD
I GENUINELY LIKE THE KID,
GENUINELY LIKE THE KID.
BUT NOT HIS GAME PLAY.
RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE
DONATHAN IS GOING HOME, WHICH
SOUNDS GOOD FOR ME, BUT IF
DOMENICK AND WENDELL GET TO THE
END, THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LOT
MORE ON THEIR RESUME THAN
SOMEONE LIKE ME, BUT I GOT THIS
EXTRA VOTE IN MY POCKET, AND
TONIGHT'S THE LAST NIGHT I CAN
USE IT.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS
WHERE IF YOU DON'T PUT A LINE IN
THE WATER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
CATCH A FISH.
SO TONIGHT I MIGHT BE GOING
FISHING, AND I WANT SOMEBODY
BIG.
I'M LIVED.
WHY?
WHY IS HE TAKING ON REWARD
THE PERSON THAT'S SUPPOSEDLY
GOING OUT THE DOOR AND GIVING
HIM FOOD AND LEAVING THE ONE
PERSON HE NEEDS TO BEAT IN THE
CHALLENGE.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD
DO THAT.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WENDELL
TOOK SEBASTIAN AND ANGELA ON THE
REWARD.
I'M THE ONE THAT'S VULNERABLE.
I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.
SO I NEED TO BEAT ANG IN THE
FINAL FIVE IMMUNITY BUT HE TAKES
ANG AND FUELS HER WITH STEAK AND
POTATOES.
I'M SO MAD I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
TRUST THEM.
I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS DECIDED
TOGETHER.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
YES, YOU DID.
I NODDED AND I AGREE THAT ANG
NEEDS A REWARD.
SHE HASN'T BEEN ON ANYTHING IN
FOREVER.
WHY ARE WE MAKING DECISIONS
BASED ON GOODWILL.
LAUREL'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT
WENDELL'S DECISION, WHICH TO ME
MADE COMPLETE SENSE.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY LAUREL'S BEING
SUPEREMOTIONAL, AND I'M
CONCERNED.
LET'S JUST KEEP OUR WHEELS ON
THE CART.
SEA BASS GOES HOME.
WE GOT TO DO IT TONIGHT.
THIS COULD RUIN EVERYTHING FOR
US, BECAUSE THIS LATE IN THE
GAME, IF SHE WANTS TO SHAKE
THINGS UP, SHE CERTAINLY CAN.
DOMENICK AND WENDELL HAVEN'T
TALKED TO ME TODAY, SO I DO FEEL
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO AIM FOR
ME.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHAT OPTIONS ARE THERE?
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
WENDELL'S SAFE AND DOM'S GOT AN
IDOL.
D.'S GOT ONE WERE WERE TO?
HE SAYS HE HAS TWO.
HE'S GOLDEN IF HE HAS TWO
IDOLS.
I THINK HE HAS ONE.
I THINK HE HAS ONE TWO.
I WONDER IF HE COULD PUT
VOTES ON DOM AND CROSS OUR
FINGERS.
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
WANT TO DO IT?
I GOT NOTHING TO LOSE BECAUSE
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO AX ME
NEXT.
SEBASTIAN SAYS, I'M GAME WITH
GETTING DOMENICK OUT.
IT'S LIKE, THAT SOUNDS GREAT TO
ME.
I'M THE OBVIOUS TARGET AFTER
THIS LAST TRIBAL I HAD.
BUT IF WE CAN CONVINCE DOMENICK
NOT TO PLAY HIS IDOL, MAYBE WE
CAN BLIND SIDE HIM.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD WITH THAT
TONIGHT?
YEAH, AND I'M ABOUT TO TELL
YOU WHY.
I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.
SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL
LAUREL.
WOW.
THIS WOULD BE AN EPIC MOVE.
IT WOULD BE SO PERFECT.
I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF
BEING PART OF A PLAN, ESPECIALLY
IF IT IS NOT AGAINST ME.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIMES AT
TRIBAL I'VE BEEN LEFT IN THE
DARK.
BUT TODAY I'M IN THE LOOP FOR
ONCE.
AND IT FEELS AMAZING.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF POWER RIGHT NOW.
HOW DID IT GO TODAY?
ANG, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
SOMETHING, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T,
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO RUIN MY
GAME, BUT ONE OF THEM HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IN
 BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET SKETCHED
OUT.
SO SEBASTIAN HAS AN EXTRA VOTE,
AND THEY'RE GUNNING FOR YOU.
HOLY CRAP.
APPARENTLY SEBASTIAN HAS THIS
EXTRA VOTE, AND HE IS TALKING TO
DONATHAN ABOUT PULLING FAST ONE
ON ME.
THANK GOD ANGELA IS A LOOSE
CANNON.
SHE JUST HAS DIARRHEA OF THE
MOUTH.
SHE JUST DOES NOT KNOW HOW THE
KEEP A SECRET.
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, YOU
GOT TO PUT YOUR VOTE ON
SEBASTIAN TONIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
NO ONE IS TAKEN ME OUT.
I HAVE TWO IDOLS.
HE THINKS YOU HAVE ONE.
SO HE THINKS YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR
ONE FOR TOMORROW.
THIS COULD BE TROUBLE.
SEBASTIAN THINKS THAT I ONLY
HAVE ONE REAL IDOL, WHICH IS
TRUE, SO NOW I MAY HAVE TO PLAY
IT TONIGHT, WHICH I DON'T WANT
TO DO.
YOU'RE WITH ME AND WENDELL?
I PROMISE.
I THINK I HAVE ANGELA ON MY
SIDE, BUT WITH DONATHAN AND
SEBASTIAN'S EXTRA VOTE, ALL HE
NEEDS IS ONE OTHER PERSON TO
COME WITH HIM, AND LAUREL IS
PRETTY ANGRY.
IF SHE FLIPS, I'M IN TROUBLE.
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING, BUT I
MAY WITH STAYING.
SEBASTIAN HAS AN EXTRA VOTE.
IF DOMENICK DOESN'T PLAY HIS
IDOL, I WON'T BE GOING HOME.
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
YEAH.
I'VE CHOSEN TO WORK WITH DOM AND
WENDELL THIS WHOLE TIME, AND
IT'S WORKED OUT WELL SO FAR, BUT
THE ONLY CHANCE THAT I HAVE OF
WINNING THIS GAME IS BY MAKING A
BIG MOVE, AND TONIGHT I HAVE A
CHANCE TO DECIDE MY FATE BY
TAKING OUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST
PLAYERS IN THE GAME.
YO.
A LOT JUST WENT DOWN.
SEA BASS HAS AN ADVANTAGE, AN
EXTRA VOTE.
HE'S GOING TO TRY TO TAKE ME OUT
BECAUSE HE THINKS I ONLY HAVE
ONE IDOL.
JUST SO YOU KNOW GOING INTO IT.
I HAVE A REAL IDOL AND I HAVE
DAVID'S FAKE IDOL FROM
MILLENNIALS VERSUS GENX, IF I
CAN SAVE THE REAL ONE FOR NEXT
TIME, THAT GUARANTEES ME A WALK
INTO FINAL FOUR, BUT IT'S A HUGE
GAMBLE NOT PLAYING IT.
I'M ROLLING THE DICE EITHER WAY.
I HOPE I DON'T CRAP OUT, BECAUSE
IF I MAKE THE WRONG DECISION,
IT'S GAME OVER.
IT'S GAME OVER.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE, JENNA,
MICHAEL, CHELSEA, AND KELLYN
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO DAY 36, FINAL SIX.
LAUREL, CAN YOU FEEL THAT
PRESSURE BUILDING AROUND CAMP?
YEAH, I THINK WE ALL FEEL
THAT PRESSURE.
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FINISH LINE
IS NEAR, AND YOU'RE WANTING TO
MAKE BIG MOVES, BUT YOU ALSO
WANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES.
I THINK THOSE ARE DECISIONS THAT
YOU WRESTLE WITH EVERY DAY.
DO YOU GO BIG, AND HOW DO YOU
ALSO GO SMART.
Jeff: DONATHAN, IS IT LIKE
CAGED TIGERS TRYING TO GET OUT
AND DO SOMETHING?
YEAH, DEFINITELY THE PRESSURE
HAS BEEN BUILDING, BUT TODAY I
NEVER HAD REALLY ANY
CONVERSATION, SO THE PRESSURE IS
RELEASED FROM ME.
TODAY IS PROBABLY MY TIME
OFFICIALLY TO GO.
Jeff: DONATHAN, I HAVE
HEARD THAT STORY FROM YOU
BEFORE.
WHY IS TODAY DIFFERENT?
BECAUSE OF THE TRIBAL LAST
NIGHT AND THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT
I'M DEALING WITH TODAY FROM IT.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, DOES THAT
RING TRUE?
IS DONATHAN IN TROUBLE, OR IS
THIS PART OF HIS GAME PLAY?
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE DOES
RING TROUBLE TODAY.
I WOULD SAY THERE IS A GOOD
CHANCE OF DONATHAN GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
OH, JEFF, I DON'T BUY IT FOR
ONE SECOND.
HE'S BEEN SPEAKING EVERY TRIBAL
COUNCIL, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S
GOT NOTHING TO SAY?
WHO'S BUYING THAT?
I'M NOT BUYING THAT.
I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON THAT HE'S NOT TELLING
US, SO I'LL LET HIM START.
AND IF HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY,
I'LL TAKE OVER THE STORY.
DONATHAN?
TAKE OVER.
Jeff: GOT NOTHING?
I WANT TO MAKE SURE, YOU'RE
GOING HOME TONIGHT, THERE'S IN
EVIL PLAN THE TAKE ME OUT OF
THIS GAME.
YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH ANYONE
HERE RIGHT NOW?
NOPE.
Jeff: NOT EVEN WITH MY
FRIEND SEBASTIAN OVER HERE, HIM
AND HIS EXTRA VOTE THAT HE'S
HOLDING ON TO?
NOTHING LIKE THAT GOING ON
TONIGHT, RIGHT?
NOPE.
Jeff: NOTHING?
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU LIKE TO
BLOW IT UP AT TRIBAL, LET'S BLOW
IT UP AT TRIBAL JOWRKS GOING TO
WORK TOGETHER WITH SEBASTIAN
WITH HIS EXTRA VOTE AND MAYBE
ANOTHER PERSON OR TWO TO COME
GET ME.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, DO YOU
KNOW WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO?
YEAH, I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CAT GOT OUT
OF THE BAG, BUT I DO HAVE AN
EXTRA VOTE.
Jeff: SEA BASS, YOU WANT
THE PLAY BALL WITH DONATHAN TO
THE END OF THIS GAME.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
TONIGHT, SO GOOD LUCK.
I KNOW THEIR POCKETS WERE
LOADED, THAT'S WHY I'M CERTAIN
I'M GOING HOME.
MY POCKETS ARE LOADED AND I'M
JUST PREPARED TO BREAK OUT MY
POCKETS.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY.
I GOT GEAR.
I GOT GEAR.
I GOT MERCHANDISE, ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
OKAY.
HERE'S MY TWO IDOLS.
MY ANDREA IDOL I FOUND ON DAY
TWO, AND THIS IS MY JAY IDOL,
DAVID FROM MILLENNIALS VERY VS.
GENX.
JAY PLAYED THIS AND WAS VOTED
OUT BECAUSE IT WAS FAKE.
IT'S COME TO LIFE TONIGHT.
I'M READY TO PLAY BALL, IF YOU
THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GO THE
OTHER WAY, I CAN PROMISE YOU,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT AS
YOU HOPE.
Jeff: WOW, DONATHAN, ONE
LITTLE COMMENT.
ANY REGRET THAT YOU SAT DOWN AND
SAID THAT?
I DO FEEL LIKE I'M GOING
HOME.
I'M AN HONEST PERSON.
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FEEL.
BUT I TRIED TO MAKE THINGS
HAPPEN TODAY, AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU DO IN "SURVIVOR."
DONATHAN, WE HAD A SOLID
THING SINCE DAY TEN.
I HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT HONEST
AND OPEN WITH HIM.
I HAVEN'T LIED TO HIM ONCE, AND
FOR SOME REASON HE FEELS THE
NEED TO TURN ON ME FOR NO REASON
WHEN WE WERE GOING TO SAIL
THROUGH THIS GAME TOGETHER.
I DID HAVE A THING WITH THEM,
BUT I WANT TO MAKE MY OWN GAME
OUT HERE.
I DON'T WANT TO GO BY WENDELL
AND DOM THE WHOLE TIME.
IF THEY'RE INTIM DATED BY THAT,
THEN BY HELL, LET THEM BE.
IT'S NOT INTIMIDATION.
IT'S JUST US TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT YOUR GAME PLAN IS, MAN.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY, HEY,
LET'S GET TO THE FINAL FOUR...
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO DO.
I'M HERE TO PLAY MY GAME.
OKAY, SO IF I PULL THIS
OUT...
WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE.
WHEN DOES THIS SAVE ME?
TOMORROW?
YES, BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAST
TIME YOU CAN PLAY IT.
BUT WHAT IF I HAVE A PLUS ONE
TO THE PARTY THAT I COULD HAVE
USED FOR YOU BUT INSTEAD MAYBE
I'LL USE IT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
YOU CAN DO THAT.
THESE COULD HAVE BEEN USED
FOR YOU, BRO.
YOU NEVER LET ME IN ON THOSE,
BRO.
WHY DO I NEED TO LET YOU IN
ON WHAT'S MY POSSESSION, BRO.
BECAUSE IT'S AN ALLIANCE,
BRO.
I'LL THROW THIS ONE ON TWO,
IF I CAN.
GOT A LOT OF JEWELRY HERE
TONIGHT.
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU,
DONATHAN.
I DON'T WANT YOUR WORK NO
MORE, WENDELL.
THAT'S FINE.
Jeff: DOM, YOU'RE BACK IN
YOUR BAG.
YEAH.
Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS IS DAVID'S AUTHENTIC
FAKE IDOL THAT HE PLAYED WITH
SIX PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME, AND
BEING THAT THERE ARE SIX PEOPLE
LEFT IN THE GAME, I'M READY TO
GIVE IT TO YOU NOW.
I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS IF YOU
DON'T MIND.
OKAY.
THANK YOU BUDDY.
IT'S IN THE REAL.
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, DOMENICK
MADE A BIG MOVE.
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE GAME?
IT'S VERY INTERESTING MOVE TO
MAKE IT BEFORE WE VOTE,
ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE TALK
ABOUT AN EXTRA VOTE.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF
THE EARLY IDOL, BUT I DON'T
THINK MY GAME PLAN HAS CHANGED.
IT'S PART OF HIS GAME PLAN, AND,
YOU KNOW, HE'S READY TO SAY I'M
SAFE, AND THAT'S A GREAT FEELING
IN THIS GAME, ESPECIALLY AT SIX.
Jeff: WENDELL, WHERE ARE WE
RIGHT NOW?
IT'S A TRICKY NIGHT HERE,
BECAUSE DOM CLEARLY JUST PLAYED
AN IDOL.
SEA BASS MAY OR MAY NOT BE USING
AN ADDITIONAL VOTE, AND DONATHAN
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING UP HIS
SLEEVE.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M VOTING
YET.
Jeff: LAUREL, IS IT HARD
GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING
SAID RIGHT NOW TO HAVE ANY
CERTAINTY THAT WHAT HAS BEEN
SAID IS THE TRUTH.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF
WHAT'S BEEN SAID IS THE TRUTH.
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING
WAS IN THE WORKS.
Jeff: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
IT'S STILL IN THE WORKS?
I DO BELIEVE IT'S STILL IN
THE WORKS.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
WAIT.
REAL QUICK, JEFF.
SO YOU ALREADY HAVE MY IDOL
HERE.
ANYONE WILL NOTICE, THIS NOTE
LOOKS A LITTLE SHORT.
IT WAS A FEW ADDITIONAL WORDS
THAT GO WITH IT.
THIS TAINTEDDED IDOL HAS NOT
MATURED INTO A REAL IDOL.
INSTEAD YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN
POWER LIES IN YOUR ABILITY TO
USE THIS FAKE IDOL TO FOOL
ANOTHER PLAYER.
THIS IDOL IS A MILLION DOLLAR
GAMBLE I'M TAKING RIGHT NOW.
IF IT GOES BUST, I CAN'T SAY I
DIDN'T TRY.
Jeff: DOMENICK IS TELLING
THE TRUTH.
THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DOM WILL
COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DOM.
ONE VOTE DOMENICK.
DONATHAN.
SEBASTIAN.
WE'RE TIED, ONE VOTE DOMENICK,
ONE VOTE DONATHAN, ONE VOTE
SEBASTIAN.
SEBASTIAN.
THAT'S TWO VOTES SEBASTIAN, ONE
VOTE DONATHAN, ONE VOLT
DOMENICK.
15th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
SEBASTIAN.
OH, MAN.
Jeff: THAT'S THREE, THAT'S
ENOUGH.
YOU NEED BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
YOU'RE THE BEST GUY EVER.
SEBASTIAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA HOW
MUCH FUN I HAD WITH ALL YOU.
IT WAS TRULY A PLEASURE.
Jeff: WELL, IT IS ONE OF
THE TOUGHEST PARTS OF THIS GAME,
TRYING TO READ WHEN SOMEONE IS
TELLING THE TRUTH AND WHEN
THEY'RE BLUFFING, AND IF YOU
GUESS WRONG, YOU COULD BE GONE.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.
I AM SO FREAKING STUPID.
DOM IS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR.
I HAD SUCH GOOD NUMBERS ON MY
HANDS, AND HE MADE ME KEEP MY
EXTRA VOTE IN MY POCKET.
THAT EXTRA VOTE IS CURSED.
WHOEVER GETS THAT NEXT, I HOPE
YOU CAN PLAY IT RIGHT.
I THINK THAT WAS A MILLION
DOLLAR MISTAKE.
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
Jeff: WAS IT A $1 MILLION
MISTAKE?
THIS IS THE PARCHMENT.
IT GOT McKAYLA.
IT GOT KELLYN EARLIER IN THE
SEASON.
AND IT JUST GOT SEBASTIAN.
YES, IT WILL BE COMING BACK.
FOR THOSE OF YOU KEEPING TRACK,
SO FAR SIX OF THE SEVEN GHOST
ISLAND RELICS HAVE CURSED AGAIN,
SO SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT BAD
MOJO.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T DO A
SEASON LIKE THIS WITHOUT A
HISTORY OF BAD DECISIONS, SO WE
THOUGHT IT'S ONLY FITTING TO
HAVE SOME OF THOSE EARLY PLAYERS
WHO MADE THOSE NOTORIOUS BAD
DECISIONS HERE WITH US TONIGHT.
HERE ARE TWO OF OUR FAVORITE,
ERIC AND JAMES.
[APPLAUSE]
THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT SPORTS FOR
YEARS LETTING US CALL THEM THE
DUMBEST MOVES AND ALL THAT
STUFF.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS
LIKE FOR THEM TO RELIVE THIS ALL
OVER AGAIN, AND I HAVE AN
APOLOGY FOR BOTH OF THEM.
MORE GHOST ISLAND FINALE COMING
UP.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
AND THEN THERE WERE FIVE.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
YES, SIR.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WENDELL, I HAVE THE TAKE BACK
THE NECKLACE.
IT'S ALL YOUR, JEFF.
Jeff: THANK YOU.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO SWIM TO A PLATFORM,
CLIMB UP, SLIDE DOWN.
YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOU WAY THROUGH
A SERIES OF OBSTACLE, COLLECTING
BAGS OF PUZZLE PIECES ALONG THE
WAY.
ONCE YOU REACH THE FINISH,
YOU'LL USE THE PIECES INSIDE TO
SOLVE A FOUR-PIECE PYRAMID
PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE NINTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO IT.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND A SPOT IN THE
FINAL FOUR, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
37 DAYS.
EVERYBODY LOOKING SURPRISINGLY
STRONG IN THE SWIM RIGHT NOW.
YOU GOT TO GET ON TO THE
PLATFORM, CLIMB UP, AND THEN
SLIDE DOWN.
WENDELL FIRST.
HERE COMES LAUREL RIGHT BEHIND.
THERE'S DOMENICK.
HERE COMES DONATHAN.
ANGELA STRUGGLING TO GET TO THE
PLATFORM.
SHE'S THE LAST THERE.
GOT TO CLIMB UP IT, ANGELA.
LET'S GO.
YOU GOT TO DIG!
WENDELL IN THE EARLY LEAD.
YOU'RE GOING UNDER THIS FIRST
OBSTACLE.
WENDELL UNTYING THE FIRST OF TWO
BAGS.
HERE COMES LAUREL RIGHT BEHIND.
THERE'S DOMENICK.
DONATHAN LOSING HIS SHORTS.
ANGELA STILL STRUGGLING TO STAY
IN THIS BUT NOT GIVING UP.
WENDELL'S OVER FIRST.
WENDELL WORKING TOWARD THAT
SECOND BAG NOW.
LAUREL HAS HER FIRST BAG.
SHE'S HEADING TOWARD THAT SECOND
BAG.
DONATHAN HAS HIS FIRST BAG.
DOMENICK HAS HIS FIRST BAG.
EVERYBODY WORKING ON THEIR
SECOND BAG EXCEPT ANGELA.
WENDELL HAS HIS SECOND BAG.
HE'S FIRST TO THE FINISH
PLATFORM.
HE CAN START UNTYING THOSE BAGS.
HEAD STARTS MATTER BECAUSE
THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE.
LAUREL IS RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
THERE'S ANGELA WITH HER FIRST
BAG.
SHE'S HEADING TO HER SECOND BAG.
DONATHAN HAS HIS SECOND BAG.
DOMENICK HAS HIS SECOND BAG.
ANGELA STILL DEAD LAST.
IT IS A FOUR-PIECE PYRAMID
PUZZLE, FOUR MEASLY PIECES OF
WOOD MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN BETWEEN YOU AND $1
MILLION PAYDAY.
FIRST TO GET IT TOGETHER
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
LOSE YOU GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
ANGELA HAS HER SECOND BAG.
SHE MAKES HER WAY TO THE
PLATFORM.
ANGELA'S BACK IN THIS NOW.
DOMENICK, WENDELL, DONATHAN,
LAUREL, AND ANGELA, 37 DAYS INTO
"SURVIVOR" WANT TO WIN RIGHT
HERE.
YOU WILL KNOW WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE WILL BE NO MISTAKING THIS
PUZZLE WHEN IT'S FINISHED.
IT WILL BE A PYRAMID.
ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT IS WRONG.
EVERYBODY HERE HAS WON
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AT LEAST
WITNESS EXCEPT DONATHAN.
THIS WILL BE A PERFECT TIME TO
JOIN THAT GROUP.
JEFF.
Jeff: OUT OF NOWHERE,
WENDELL QUIETLY BUILDS THE
PYRAMID THAT GUARANTEES SHAME
SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR.
WENDELL WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
WENDELL, COME ON OVER.
NICE JOB, BROTHER.
Jeff: BACK-TO-BACK WINS,
SAFE AGAIN TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
GUARANTEED A ONE IN FOUR SHOT.
AT FOR THE REST OF YOU, 7 DAYS.
FINAL FIVE IS IMPRESSIVE.
IT IS STILL SHORT OF THE
ULTIMATE GOAL.
FOR ONE OF YOU THAT WILL BE THE
CASE.
TONIGHT SOMEBODY GOING HOME,
BECOME THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
IT WON'T BE YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR
ME.
I HAVE BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR ME.
I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AND
AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THIS IS ME THINKING HOW CAN I
POSTURE MYSELF IN FRONT OF THE
JURY.
DOMENICK MAY BE LOUD AND
BOISTEROUS, BUT MAYBE SOMEBODY
NEEDS TO OUTSMART YOU TONIGHT.
THIS IS MY MOVE NOW.
GOOD JOB, WENDELL.
YOU KILLED IT.
THANKS.
GOOD JOB, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, IN MY MIND I
WAS CONVINCED THE TOP WOULD BE
FLAT.
WENDELL'S CAUGHT HIMSELF UP TO
ME.
HE'S GOT TWO VICTORIES UNDER HIS
BELT, THE SAME WAY I DO.
I CAN'T GET RID OF HIM.
WE BOTH HAVE IDOLS.
EVERY TIME I THINK I GOT THE
EDGE ON HIM AND I PULL AHEAD A
LITTLE BIT IN THIS RACE FOR THE
BEST GAME, SURE ENOUGH, HE COMES
RIGHT BACK AND BITES ME RIGHT
BACK IN THE BUTT.
NO EXCUSE.
GOOD JOB.
CONGRATULATIONS.
HAD IT BEEN A FLAT TOP, YOU
WOULD HAVE WON.
GOING INTO TRIBAL TONIGHT,
BEING I HAVE REAL IDOL TO PLAY,
I'M SAFE.
WHAT I'M NOW TRYING TO DETERMINE
IS WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME GOING
INTO FINAL FOUR.
ANGELA'S NOT REALLY A THREAT TO
ANYONE.
SO FAR THE ONLY THING SHE'S BEEN
REALLY GOOD AT IS EATING WEIRD
FOOD.
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT
GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE GOING
INTO FINAL FOUR, SO DONATHAN IS
THE OBVIOUS VOTE, BUT THIS IS
NOT AN EASY DECISION.
I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION,
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,
TOMORROW'S INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, WHAT ARE YOUR
THOUGHTS IF YOU WIN WHOM ARE YOU
TAKING WITH YOU?
YOU.
YOU'RE TAKING ME?
OH, YEAH.
WENDELL AND DOMENICK CAN EASILY
DECIDE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
TO TONIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE
SAFETY IN THEIR POCKETS.
AND I'M THINKING, DAMN, THIS
SUCKS.
THE ONLY GAME PLAN THAT I HAVE
FROM HERE ON OUT IS IF DOMENICK
PRESSES ME ENOUGH THAT I WILL
TAKE HIM TO THE FINAL THREE.
SO I HOPE I CAN SOLIDIFY THAT
RELATIONSHIP AND SAY, I'M READY
TO HAVE LIKE A HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH
SOMEBODY THAT'S PLAYED A GREAT
GAME OUT HERE.
I'M HONEST.
I WANT TO PICK YOU.
I WANT TO COMPETE AGAINST THE
BEST.
I'M NOT GOING TO B.S. YOU.
I'M WEIGHING OPTIONS.
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY FATE
IN A FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.
DONATHAN SAID, I'M DEFINITELY
TAKING YOU, LIKE THAT.
IT'S CALLED A SNAP CALL IN THE
POKER WORLD WHERE WE SAY,
SOMEONE MADE A SNAP CALL MEANS
THEY GAVE THEIR RESPONSE WITHOUT
THINKING TWICE.
THEY PUT THEIR CHIPS IN WITHOUT
EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT.
A SNAP CALL MOST OF THE TIME
REPRESENTS A BLUFF.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M BUYING IT,
BUT THE ADVANTAGE TO TAKING
DONATHAN IS THAT HE IS SUPER
WEAK IN CHALLENGES.
AND HAVING A WEAK PLAYER THERE
COULD HELP MY GAME, BECAUSE ON
THE OTHER HAND, LAUREL'S WON
CHALLENGES.
AND SO THAT MAKES LAUREL MY
NUMBER-ONE THREAT.
I FEEL VERY NERVOUS AND
EXPOSED, NOT BECAUSE I DON'T
TRUST YOU GUYS, JUST BECAUSE
IT'S FINAL FIVE, AND I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS A BIG ONE.
WE HAVE YOUR BACK.
I KNOW, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M
THE BIGGEST NOT-SAFE TARGET ON
THE BOARD, SO I'M NERVOUS.
I KNOW I'M THE BIGGEST
CHALLENGE THREAT LEFT FOR DOM
AND WENDELL IN THIS GAME.
IF THEY'RE PLAYING A LOGICAL
GAME, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO
KEEP ME.
I HAD CHANCES TO FLIP ON THEM
BUT I DIDN'T, AND NOW I'M AT THE
MORRISSEY OF DOM AND WENDELL
TONIGHT.
THERE WAS ONE CONCERN ABOUT
YOU, I'LL TELL YOU HONESTLY.
LET'S SAY YOU WIN THE FINAL FOUR
CHALLENGE, YOU'D TAKE DON-DON,
RIGHT?
I FEEL LIKE I NEED DONATHAN
ON THE JURY SO I CAN GET ONE
VOTE FOR SURE.
OF COURSE DON-DON WOULD VOTE
FOR YOU, BUT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE
ONE OF US OUT, WOULDN'T THAT BE
A RESUME BOOST FOR YOU?
I SEE YOUR POINT.
I JUST THINK MY BEST SHOT IS
THAT YOU GUYS SPLIT VOTES.
PEOPLE ARE TORN BETWEEN YOU, AND
THEN I PICK UP ENOUGH OF THE
REMAID THEIR AREN'T SPLIT
BETWEEN YOU.
LAUREL BASICALLY SAID, LOOK,
MY ONLY SHOT AT WINNING THIS
GAME IS THE VOTES BEING SPLIT
BETWEEN YOU AND WENDELL AND
MAYBE THERE'S SOME BAIT LEFT
OVER FOR ME, SOME SCRAPS FOR ME
TO PICK UP.
AND I MEAN, IT JUST SOUNDS TOO
RIDICULOUS.
EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL THAT THEY
HAVE A LEGITIMATE SHOT OUT HERE,
SO THE FLAG GOES UP, THE RED
LIGHT GOES ON, AND YOU TELL
YOU'RE, THIS IS NOT REALLY
SOMEONE WHO I WANT TO TRUST
DECIDING MY FATE.
IF SHE ENDS UP WINNING THE NEXT
CHALLENGE.
I THINK LAUREL'S FULL OF IT.
YOU THINK SHE IS?
WELL, WE NEED TO AGAIN
CONSIDER LAUREL BEATING US.
I THINK SHE IS THE ONLY THREAT
TO US TOMORROW.
I WANT THE BRING A
NON-FACTOR.
I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT ME AND
YOU.
I'M WILLING TO LET HER GO IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
IT'S HARD ME ME THE SAY, THAT
BUT I'M NOT OPPOSED TO MAKING
ANY MOVES TONIGHT.
TONIGHT I HAVE POWER IN THAT
I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AND I
HAVE AN IDOL SOME IT'S A MATTER
OF HOW I USE ERIC'S IDOL TO
PROTECT ONE OF THE THREE PEOPLE
REMAINING.
LAUREL, ANG, OR DONATHAN.
THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE, AND SHIFT THE JURY IN
MY FAVOR.
BUT THIS IS A VERY RISKY
DECISION.
ERIC MADE A TERRIBLE DECISION
WITH HIS IDOL WHEN HE GAVE IT
AWAY.
I WILL BE HERE TOMORROW, BUT
WHATEVER I DO TONIGHT COULD
SCREW UP MY GAME GOING FORWARD.
I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO
REVERSE THE CURSE, AND I'M GOING
TO TRY MY BEST.
HOPEFULLY I'M MAKING THE RIGHT
CHOICE.
HOPEFULLY I'M MAKING THE RIGHT
CHOICE.
Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE, JENNA,
MICHAEL, CHELSEA, KELLYN, AND
SEBASTIAN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
LAUREL, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL A
LOT WENT ON.
THERE WAS GRANDSTANDING, THERE
WAS BLUFFING.
THIS IS A BIG TRIBAL TONIGHT,
BECAUSE IF YOU SURVIVE TONIGHT,
AT THE VERY LEAST YOU GOT A SHOT
AT MAKING FIRE TO GET TO THE
END.
SO WHAT WAS THE VIBE BACK AT
CAMP?
THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE
BACK AT CAMP.
I MEAN, WENDELL WON AGAIN, SO
HE'S SAFE TONIGHT.
WE KNOW THAT DOM HAS HIS IDOL.
SO ALL THREE OF US ARE ON THE
LINE TONIGHT.
Jeff: BUT ANGELA, ALL THREE
OF YOU CAN'T REALLY BE ON THE
LINE TONIGHT, RIGHT?
YEAH, I DEFINITELY THINK SO.
I MEAN, I SAW DOMENICK AND
WENDELL TALKING TOGETHER,
RUNNING IDEAS BACK AND FORTH.
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT IS A HUGE
DECISION FOR THOSE TWO.
Jeff: DONATHAN, AGREE WITH
THAT, THAT DOMENICK AND WENDELL
ARE DEBATING WHICH ONE OF YOU TO
SEND TO THE JURY AND WHICH TWO
TO BRING WITH THEM.
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM AND WE
HAVE TO LAY OUT WHAT WE THINK IS
GOING TO MAKE THEIR GAME BETTER
FOR THEM.
I'VE NOT WON INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
THESE GIRLS BOTH HAVE IMMUNITY
WINS.
SO YOU MAY HAVE TO MAKE A CHANCE
WITH ME BECAUSE I MAY BE THE
FIRST OUT IN THE CHALLENGE
TOMORROW, AND THESE GUYS COULD
REALLY FACE THAT CHALLENGE
TOMORROW.
Jeff: DOMENICK, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT THERE COULD BE
A TURNING POINT WHERE NEVER
HAVING WON BECOMES AN ASSET,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING
SOMEBODY TOMORROW THAT COULD
BEAT YOU.
ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.
WHAT HE'S SAYING MAKES SENSE TO
ME.
YOU CAN HAVE PLAYED THE GREATEST
GAME UP TO DAY 37 AND THEN HAVE
THE BIGGEST BLUNDER IN YOUR GAME
BY PICKING THE WRONG PERSON TO
GO AND MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU.
SO MY MIND IS NOT MADE UP.
Jeff: WENDELL, DOES ALL OF
THE TALK OF CURSED IDOLS OR
CURSED ADVANTAGE, DOES IT ADD
EVEN MORE AWARENESS TO THE FACT,
WOW, THAT'S RIGHT, EVERY
DECISION MATTERS OUT HERE?
I'VE DEFINITELY THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT, JEFF.
I HAVE PROBABLY THE MOST CURSED
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IDOL IN THE
HISTORY OF SURVIVOR, ERIC'S
NECKLACE.
I KEEP THINKING IF THE DECISION
I MAKE IS GOING TO CURSE ME
GOING FORWARD IN THIS GAME.
I HAVE THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO
SAVE ONE OUT OF THE THREE FOLKS
IN FRONT OF ME OR I CAN HOLD IT
FOR MYSELF.
IT'S A DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE
IN.
Jeff: DOMENICK IT'S
INTERESTING THAT WENDELL WITHIN
SAYING I HAVE SOMETHING OF
POWER, I DON'T NEED IT, MAYBE
I'LL GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY.
DID YOU HAVE ANY DISCUSSION?
IT'S UP TO HIM.
HE HOLDS THE POWER.
I CAN ONLY PROTECT MYSELF
TONIGHT.
Jeff: WENDELL, I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE RIGHT BACK IN A BIG GAME
OF BLUFF.
THERE'S NO CHANCE EVERYBODY IS
BEING COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF
CONVERSATIONS, AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING TOGETHER A LOT.
IT'S NO SECRET.
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M
DOING WITH THIS IDOL.
I'M NOT THROWING HIM ANY MORE
BONES.
NOW IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL GAME.
Jeff: LAUREL.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, SOMETHING
TO CRACK.
YEAH, I MEAN, THEM
DISAGREEING IS A GOOD THING.
I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH
THESE GUYS A LONG TIME.
THEY'VE SAVED ME QUITE A FEW
VOTES, AND I'VE SAVED THEM QUITE
A FEW VOTES.
FOR ME I'M HOPING THAT LOYALTY
OUTWEIGHS THE STRENGTH VOTE.
WE'RE AT THE NITTY GAZA CITY,
HONY.
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO WHERE WE
CAN'T RELY ON LOYALTY ANYMORE.
IT'S ABOUT GETTING YOURSELF TO
THAT THREE.
LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER, I HAVE
NOT HAD GREAT IMMUNITY WINS.
I STRUGGLED IN CHALLENGES.
IT WILL BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR
THOSE TWO BACK THERE IF THEY
PICK ME TONIGHT FOR WHATEVER
LIES FOR TOMORROW.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
ANGELA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
TONIGHT IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN
DO SO.
I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST.
YOU GOT A BIG FINALE YOU'RE
GOING TO DO?
A LITTLE ONE.
ALL RIGHT, JEFFREY.
THIS IS THE SEASON 26 IDOL,
ANDREA HAD THIS IN HER POCKET.
COCHRAN BLINDSIDED HER.
SHE WENT HOME WITH.
THIS I AM LOOKING TO REVERSE THE
CURSE.
Jeff: YOU'RE PLAYING IT FOR
YOURSELF?
PLAYING IT FOR MYSELF, YES.
Jeff: OKAY.
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DOMENICK WILL
NOT COUNT.
MAY I SAY A LITTLE SOMETHING,
JEFF?
Jeff: SURE.
A FEW WEEKS AGO SOMEONE CAME
IN THIS GAME AND WEED UP, AND
SHE REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE FROM
BACK HOME.
SHE REMINDED ME OF 'Y SISTER
IRAN.
I TOLD HER I WOULD BE LOYAL TO
HER LIKE I WOULD BE LOYAL TO MY
SISTER, SO LAUREL, I WANT THE
PLAY THIS FOR YOU.
THIS MIGHT NOT BE SMART
STRATEGIC MOVE, BUT I'M STANDING
BY YOU, AND I APPRECIATE ALL
THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND
OUR ALLIANCE.
WENDELL, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, CAN I PLAY THIS FOR
MYSELF.
Jeff: THANK YOU, LAUREL.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR LAUREL WILL
NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
LAUREL.
DOES NOT COUNT.
DONATHAN.
ONE VOTE DONATHAN.
DONATHAN.
THAT'S TWO VOTES DONATHAN.
16th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
DONATHAN.
THAT'S THREE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
LAST MALOLO.
GIVE IT HELL, GIRL.
JEFF, I HAVE HAD THE WONDERFUL
MOST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.
Jeff: DONATHAN, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
Jeff: ANGELA, DOMENICK,
WENDELL, LAUREL, YOU HAVE MADE
IT TO THE FINAL FOUR.
TOMORROW YOU'LL COMPETE IN YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
WIN, YOU ARE GUARANTEED A SPOT
AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
I HAD THE MOST AMAZING TIME
PLAYING THIS GAME.
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS
UNDERESTIMATED MYSELF.
SO TO COME OUT HERE AND DO AS
GREAT AS I DID, IT'S WORTH MORE
THAN $1 MILLION TO ME, BECAUSE
THE LESSONS THAT I LEARNED OUT
HERE, I CAN APPLY TO REAL LIFE
NOW AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S
SOMETHING THAT I'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER FOR ETERNITY.
Jeff: DONATHAN, HE WENT
DOWN FIGHTING WITH THOSE TRUTH
BOMBS.
LET'S BRING HIM OUT.
COME ON, DONATHAN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HE WAS A TRUE FISH OUT OF WATER.
HELLO, JEFF.
Jeff: DONATHAN, WE WATCHED
YOU PLAY THIS GAME, AND WHEN YOU
STARTED, YOU REALLY WERE A FISH
OUT OF WATER.
AND DAY BY DAY WE WATCHED YOU
FIND YOUR VOICE AND GAIN MORE
CONFIDENCE.
I HEARD FROM SO MANY PEOPLE, DID
YOU CHANGE AS A RESULT, BECAUSE
YOU TALKED ABOUT BACK HOME YOU
WEREN'T ALWAYS SUPPORTED AND YOU
FELT PICKED ON AT TIMES?
YEAH, AS -- SORRY.
I'M SO NERVOUS.
AT THE AGE OF EIGHT I STARTED
JIM NEWSCASTICS, AND AS 13 I
CAME OUT AS A GUY GUY IN A
PARTICULAR AREA THAT THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN.
ALONG THE WAY I LOST MY VOICE.
AND I GOT BULLIED A LOT.
BUT COMING ON "SURVIVOR," I
WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE I HAD A
VOICE AND I WAS GOING THE BREAK
SOME WALLS DOWN WHILE I WAS OUT
THERE, AND I THINK THAT I DID
THAT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELL, YOU DEFINITELY
DID, AND I WANT TO SHARE
SOMETHING.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ANOTHER
QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE
RESPONDED, BUT THEN HONESTLY,
JUST ABOUT 20 SECONDS AGO
BACKSTAGE YOU HAVE ANOTHER VERY
BIG FAN.
WE SORT OF HAVE THIS "SURVIVOR"
BEN FACTOR FAN IN SIA THE POP
STAR.
A FEW SEASONS AGO SHE WAS SO
PROVED BY TY'S STORY THAT SHE
WANTED TO BE INVOLVED IN HIS
LIFE.
AND THIS SEASON SHE WAS SO
TOUCHED BY THE WAY YOU HAVE
DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO YOUR
FAMILY THAT SHE WANTS TO GIVE
YOU $10,000 TO HELP YOU TAKE
CARE OF YOUR FAMILY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jeff: THANK YOU.
YOU ARE AWESOME.
MORE "SURVIVOR."
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
A LOT MORE SHOW LEFT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
HERE WE ARE.
STARTED WITH 20.
WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.
DAY 38, YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
YEAH.
YES, SIR.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WENDELL, FOR THE SECOND TIME IF
A ROW, GOT TO TAKE BACK THE
NECKLACE.
THANK YOU.
NO PROBLEM.
Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON A WOBBLY
BEAM WHILE USING A LONG POLE TO
STACK BALLS ON STANDS.
AT ANY POINT YOUR STACK DROPS.
YOU GOT TO START OVER.
FIRST PERSON TO STACK ALL SIX
BALLS WINS IMMUNITY, IS
GUARANTEED A SPOT AT THAT FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE YOU WILL
GET YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO STATE
YOUR CASE, WHY YOU DESERVE THE
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE
MILLION DOLLARS.
IN ADDITION, YOU GET TO CHOOSE
ONE PERSON TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AT
THAT FINAL AND FORCE THE
REMAINING TWO TO SHOWDOWN IN A
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.
LET'S DRAW FOR SPOTS AND GET IT
ON.
FINAL CHALLENGE.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO
RIGHT HERE.
38 DAYS OF COMPETITION IS GOING
TO REQUIRE A BASE THAT'S VERY
FIRM AND HANDS THAT ARE REALLY
SURGEON-LIKE.
WENDELL OFF THE A QUICK START.
PLACES HIS FIRST BALL.
ANGELA RIGHT IN IT.
DOMENICK PLACES HIS FIRST.
38 DAYS CAN MAKE THE SIMPLEST
THING DIFFICULT.
WENDELL BACK WITH HIS SECOND
STAND.
EVERYBODY HERE HAS WON
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE.
BUT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT WOULD
FEEL LIKE TONIGHT.
WENDELL WITH HIS SECOND BALL.
HERE COMES DOMENICK.
DOMENICK WORKING ON THAT SECOND
BALL.
DOMENICK FIGHTING, LOSING IT,
TRYING TO ADJUST IT AND HE DOES.
DOMENICK HAS HIS SECOND BALL.
NICE RECOVERY.
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT
IS LOOKING STRAIGHT, BECAUSE THE
HIGHER IT GETS, THE TOUGHER IT
GETS.
IT IS WENDELL WITH HIS FOURTH
STAND, THEN ANGELA.
HERE COMES DOMENICK WITH HIS
THIRD STAND.
LAUREL WITH HER SECOND BALL.
LAUREL WITH THAT FOURTH BALL.
THERE ARE ONLY SIX BALLS TOTAL.
HE'S GOT IT.
DOMENICK TRYING TO GET BACK IN
IT.
DOMENICK PLACES HIS THIRD STAND.
DOMENICK LOSES EVERYTHING.
HE'S GOT TO START OVER NOW.
A HUGE SETBACK FOR DOMENICK.
HERE COMES THE FIFTH BALL FOR
WENDELL.
IT WOULD BE HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN IN A ROW.
WENDELL STILL LOOKING PRETTY
STRAIGHT.
WILL IT STAY?
YES.
LAUREL STILL STRUGGLING TO GET
BACK IN THIS.
LAUREL DROPS.
SHE'S GOT TO START OVER.
ANGELA PLACES HER FOURTH BALL.
HERE COMES DOMENICK WITH HIS
SECOND.
WENDELL PLACING HIS SIXTH STAND.
WENDELL HAS ONE BALL LEFT.
THAT STACK IS LEANING.
WILL IT STAY?
WILL IT HOLD?
38 DAYS, AND IT COMES DOWN TO
THIS, A BACKYARD CHALLENGE
POTENTIALLY FOR $1 MILLION.
AND WENDELL LOSES EVERYTHING.
JUST AS HE'S COMING UP WITH HIS
FINAL BALL.
IT IS NOW ANGELA IN THE LEAD.
SHE RESETS NOW TAKING HER TIME.
SHE'S GOT A BIG LEAD.
SHE CAN SLOW DOWN FOR A MINUTE.
ANGELA'S WOBBLY AT THE BOTTOM.
AND ANGELA DROPS.
IT IS DOMENICK NOW IN THE LEAD.
THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER GIVE UP
TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON
"SURVIVOR."
YOU ARE REMINDED TO KEEP
FIGHTING, AND THIS IS WHY.
ANYTHING CAN AND OFTEN DOES
HAPPEN.
IT IS NOW DOMENICK IN THE LEAD
WITH THREE BALLS COMING BACK
WITH HIS FOURTH.
DOMENICK PLACES HIS FOURTH BALL.
IT IS A RACE TO CATCH DOMENICK.
DOMENICK IS JUST TRYING TO BUILD
IT TALL ENOUGH AND STRAIGHT
ENOUGH TO PUT THIS BABY IN BED.
WENDELL QUICKLY BACK IN IT
PLACING HIS THIRD STAND.
DOMENICK WITH HIS FIFTH STAND.
ANGELA TRYING TO GET BACK IN IT.
WENDELL PLACES HIS THIRD BALL.
LAUREL WITH HER SECOND.
DOMENICK PLACES HIS FIFTH BALL,
REALLY TAKING HIS TIME, WHICH
OPENS THE DOOR FOR WENDELL TO
CATCH HIM.
WENDELL BACK WITH HIS FOURTH
BALL NOW.
THIS IS THE SHOWDOWN OF THE
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
HERE COMES DOMENICK WITH HIS
SIXTH AND FINAL STAND.
AND HE'S GOT IT.
LAUREL LOSES EVERYTHING AGAIN.
WENDELL WITH HIS FIFTH STAND.
HE'S WORKING HARD TO MAKE UP
TIME.
DOMENICK NOW COMING BACK WITH
HIS SIXTH AND FINAL BALL.
THIS WOULD DO IT RIGHT HERE
GUARANTEEING HIM A SPOT AT THAT
FINAL TRIBAL.
WENDELL CONTINUES TO DIG, COMING
BACK WITH HIS FIFTH BALL.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT ON DAY 38
IN THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
ON "SURVIVOR."
DOMENICK PLACES THE SIXTH BALL.
HE'S GOT TO GET BACK TO THE
START.
AND HE DOES!
DOMENICK WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY AND A GUARANTEED SPOT
AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
[APPLAUSE]
 GOOD JOB, DOM.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: DOMENICK, COME ON
OVER.
FINAL INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
YOU ARE GOING TO THE FINAL
TRIBAL.
I CAN SEE THE EMOTION ALREADY.
I DON'T KNOW, MAN, IT'S
JUST... 38 DAYS OF JUST NON-STOP
EMOTION, AND IT'S STILL NOT
OVER.
WE GOT WORK TO DO STILL, JEFF.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
DOM SAID IT.
IT'S NOT OVER.
YOU STILL HAVE A BIG DECISION TO
MAKE.
TONIGHT YOU ARE GOING TO DECIDE
WHICH ONE OF THESE THREE SITS
NEXT TO YOU AT THAT FINAL TRIBAL
AND WHICH TWO HAVE TO BATTLE IT
OUT IN A FIRE-MAKING SHOWDOWN
AND EARN IT.
SHOULD MAKE FOR A VERY
INTERESTING AFTERNOON.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BACK AT
CAMP.
THE FOUR OF YOU ARE GOING THE
LEAVE HERE FOR ONE FINAL VISIT
TO GHOST ISLAND, WHERE YOU WILL
GET YOUR CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR
CASE TO DOM.
IN ADDITION, YOU ALSO HAVE ONE
FINAL TASK.
READ THIS IN PRIVATE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT THE
GHOST ISLAND.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
Jeff: CONGRATS.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: ALL I NEEDED WAS JUST
TO WIN IMMUNITY.
DOMENICK IS THE MAN WITH A LOT
OF POWER.
I KNOW HE WANTS TO GET ME OUT OF
HERE.
SO I HAVE ONE TASK.
I HAVE MAKE FIRE BEFORE WHOEVER
IS NEXT TO ME.
IF I MESS UP, I GOT TO SIT IN
THE FINAL THREE.
THIS HAS BEEN A DREAM OF MINE
TONIGHT IS DO OR DIE FOR ME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I WON THE CHALLENGE.
AFTER 38 DAYS OF UPS AND DOWNS,
LEFTS AND RIGHTS, WHEELING AND
DEALING, I'VE SECURED MY SPOT
INTO THE FINAL THREE.
I'M HAPPY I'M GOING TO SEE GHOST
ISLAND NOT AS A VICTIM BUT AS,
YOU KNOW, A WINNER, BUT THIS
GAME IS FAR FROM OVER.
BECAUSE I HAVE A HUGE DECISION
TO MAKE ON WHO TO BRING WITH ME
TO THE FINAL THREE, AND IF I
SCREW THAT UP, IT'S GOING TO
COST ME $1 MILLION.
WELCOME TO GHOST ISLAND.
HERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THIS.
WOW.
ONE BAD DECISION CAN HAUNT
YOU FOREVER.
IT FEELS TERRIBLE BEING BACK AT
GHOST ISLAND, ESPECIALLY UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.
I LOST THE CHALLENGE.
NOW DOM IS IMMUNE TONIGHT.
HE GETS TO PICK WHO GOES WITH
HIM TO THE FINAL THREE, AND THEN
THE REMAINING TWO HAVE TO BATTLE
IT OUT MAKING FIRE, ND I KNOW
HE'S NOT CHOOSING ME TO GO
FORWARD, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE NEXT TO ME, BECAUSE I
THINK HE'S A LITTLE SCARED OF
THE GAME I PLAYED, YOU KNOW?
HOWEVER, I FEEL CONFIDENT IN MY
FIRE-MAKING ABILITY, SO I THINK
I SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
MR. WENDELL.
I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR DOING
THAT, AND TONIGHT I'M GOING TO
MAKE SOME FIRE.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
OTHER TWO?
I FEEL LIKE I COULD BEAT
EITHER ONE OF THEM, BUT YOU'RE
THE POWER MAN, SO THE BALL IS IN
YOUR COURT.
OBVIOUSLY WENDELL IS MY
BIGGEST CONCERN OUT HERE.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER.
BUT HE KNOWS THAT I CAN'T BRING
HIM.
I CAN'T HAND HIM AN INVITE INTO
THE FINAL THREE.
HE'S PLAYED A GREAT GAME.
AND I THINK HE HAS THE RESPECTED
OF A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE
JURY, AND THAT'S A THREAT TO ME.
SO I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF
THOSE GIRLS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE
OF BEATING HIM.
I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME MORE
TIME TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION,
BUT JUST PRACTICE.
DO WHAT THE COMPETITOR LAUREL
WOULD DO.
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ME?
YOU DON'T KNOW?
IT'S NOT A BLUFF.
I CANNOT BEAT HIM IN FIRE.
I'D LOVE TO BE BAD ASS AND MAKE
FIRE, BUT I'M NOT THE ONE TO
TAKE HIM OUT.
I AM SO FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THIS
IS THE HURDLE I HAVE TO GET TO
GET TO FINAL THREE.
I KNOW I AM NOT GOOD AT MAKING
FIRE.
I'VE SEEN WENDELL DO IT.
I'VE SEEN DOM DO IT.
I HAVE NOT PRACTICEs AS MUCH
AS I SHOULD HAVE.
I KNOW THAT'S THE CARDINAL RULE
OF "SURVIVOR."
KNOW HOW THE MAKE FIRE.
SO I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT NOW.
I DON'T WANT HIM THINKING I HAVE
A SHOT AT.
THIS I MEAN, ANGELA IS A LOT
BETTER WITH FIRE THAN I AM.
IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT, YOU WIN
$1 MILLION.
IT'S NOT ME THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
HIM OUT, IT'S ANG.
I DON'T KNOW IF LAUREL IS A
VIABLE OPTION AT THIS POINT.
SHE'S KIND OF GIVEN UP ON
HERSELF OUT HERE SAYING, DON'T
MAKE ME FIGHT FOR FIRE.
LET ME JUST COME WITH YOU.
I DON'T RESPECT THAT.
YOU'RE ON "SURVIVOR."
WHAT THE HECK WAS SHE THINKING
NOT PRACTICING MAKING FIRE.
WE ALL KNEW THIS WAS COMING.
SO I MAY HAVE TO GO WITH PLAN
"B."
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE STRONGEST
THAT COULD TAKE WENDELL OUT IN
THE FIRE.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY FAITH IN
LAUREL TO DO IT.
I WANT TO PUT MY FAITH IN YOU
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF ANYONE IS
GOING TO KICK HIS ASS IT'S YOU.
HE'S GOOD.
DOMENICK WANTS ME TO GO AGAINST
WENDELL.
I KNOW HOW THE DO IT.
I KNOW THE BASICS.
STILL, THE IDEA DEFINITELY MAKES
ME NERVOUS, AND TO BE HONEST, I
THINK DOM GOING TO THE END WITH
LAUREL WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE.
HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH THAT.
SHE'S NEVER PISSED ANYBODY OFF
AND SHE'S SWEET.
SHE'S NICE.
EVERYBODY LIKES HER.
I DON'T HAVE THOSE BONDS.
BECAUSE NOBODY TALKED TO ME.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
Jeff: THAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE.
I KNOW.
THIS IS SO TOUGH FOR ME.
DOM, SHE KNOWS THE GAME.
SHE'S A YALE GRADUATE.
SHE'S A TALKER.
LAUREL IS GOING TO DISCREDIT
ME.
BIG TIME.
SHE IS GOING TO FUEL THE FIRE.
SHE WILL GO DOWN FIGHTING.
WHAT LANG IS SAYING DOES MAKE
SENSE.
BUT WENDELL IS STILL THE BIGGEST
THREAT OUT HERE, AND I THINK
ANGELA MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME
GET RID OF HIM.
SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE, AND I'M
JUST LIKE, YOU HAVE MADE IT 38
DAYS.
I THINK YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
SO YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN
YOURSELF.
WENDELL IS THE BATTLE I HAVE
TO BEAT.
AND IF I CAN HELP YOU TAKE HIM
OUT, WE CAN BE SITTING THERE AT
THE END.
ALL RIGHT.
THE MILITARY PREACHES PRIOR
PLANNING, SO THEY ALWAYS SAY
PRIOR PLANNING PREVENTS POOR
PERFORMANCE.
YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH
THIS.
RIGHT.
I'M VERY SCARED.
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT,
BECAUSE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S IT.
I'M STILL HERE.
I'M STILL GOING TO WORK HARD,
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE
THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN TO
GET ME, YOU KNOW INTO, THAT TOP
THREE.
I'LL READ MY MESSAGE REAL
QUICK, SEE WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
AFTER WINNING THE CHALLENGE,
JEFF GAVE ME A LITTLE NOTE.
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO THINK.
SO I MADE MY WAY UP THIS TRAIL
TO THE TOP OF GHOST ISLAND TO
READ IT.
IT WAS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING
ACTUALLY, AND I STARTED TO GET
THAT WHOLE GHOST ISLAND FEELING.
THERE ARE REAL CURSES OUT HERE
FROM SEASONS PAST, MONUMENTAL
MISTAKES MADE IN THE GAME THAT
COST PEOPLE IN THIS GAME $1
MILLION, AND IT PLAYS WITH YOUR
MIND.
OH, MY GOD.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS SAYS HERE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT AT THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT YOU
HAVE ONE DECISION LEFT TO MAKE.
WHO TO TAKE WITH YOU.
IT'S THE SAME DECISION COLBIE,
WU, AND CULPEPPER FACED.
THEY MADE THE WRONG DECISION AND
IT WILL HAUNT THEM FOREVER.
TOMORROW NIGHT THE JURY WILL
PLACE THEIR VOTES IN ONE OF
THESE CURSED URNS.
CHOOSE ONE AND BRING IT WITH YOU
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THIS IS A $1 MILLION OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO REVERSE THE CURSE.
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER THING TO
THINK ABOUT.
YOU'RE STARING AT THESE RELICS
FROM THE PAST THAT ARE JUST
LOOKING YOU IN THE FACE AND
SAYING, ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID?
THESE ARE THE AUTHENTIC
SURVIVOR VOTING URNS FROM THREE
ICONIC SEASONS.
SECOND SEASON, SURVIVOR
AUSTRALIA, COLBIE CHOSE TINA.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR" THE
AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK, TINA.
TINA WON.
28th SEASON, WU CHOSE TONY.
Jeff: THE WINNER OF
"SURVIVOR," TONY.
TONY WON.
34th SEASON, "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS," CULPEPPER CHOSE
SARAH.
Jeff: THE WINNER OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS" SARAH.
SARAH WON.
JUST A LITTLE REMINDER BEFORE I
GO INTO MAKING THIS HUGE
DECISION, IT'S KILLING ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AS I WAS LOOKING AT THESE
URNS, I HAD THIS THOUGHT.
I'M NOT SURE THAT ANGELA CAN
BEAT WENDELL IN FIRE MAKING, SO
WHAT IF I GIVE HER MY NECKLACE
AND STEP INTO THAT RING WITH
WENDELL IN THE FIRE MAKING
CHALLENGE, BECAUSE IF I PUT
MYSELF UP AGAINST WENDELL AND
TAKE HIM OUT OF THIS GAME, IT
WOULD SHOW EVERYONE ON THAT JURY
THAT I DESERVE TO WIN THE $1
MILLION.
I HAVE TO MAKE A SERIOUS
DECISION RIGHT NOW.
GOD.
THE QUESTION IS, DO I TAKE THIS
CRAZY GAMBLE AND MAKE A
MONUMENTAL MOVE THAT COULD PUT
ME ON THE MAP AS ONE OF THE
GREATEST PLAYERS TO EVER PLAY
THIS GAME, OR DO I TAKE THE SAFE
ROUTE AND POTENTIALLY BE ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAUNTED BY
THIS POOR DECISION FOR THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES.
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE CAGAYAN
URN.
I'M HOPING PEOPLE WILL SEE MY
GAME IS PLAYED AS WELL AS TONY'S
WAS.
I WOULD BE CRAZY TO DO THIS, BUT
I ULTIMATELY DO BELIEVE IN MY
ABILITY TO MAKE FIRE BETTER THAN
ANY OF THE THREE OUT HERE, AND I
AM A HUGE GAMBLER.
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT I MIGHT
BE SICK ENOUGH TO DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, BROTHER.
IN THE EVENT SOMETHING GOES
HAYWIRE, IT'S BEEN GREAT.
IT'S ALL LOVE, GREAT GAME.
IT'S ALL GOOD, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE YOU, DUDE.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, FOR
REAL.
YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME GREAT
FOR 38 DAYS.
YOU CAN MAKE EVERY MOVE PERFECT.
BUT IF I MAKE THE WRONG DECISION
TONIGHT, IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.
AND I THINK THE ONLY THING I CAN
DO IS TRUST WHAT I'VE TRUSTED
FOR 38 DAYS OUT HERE, AND THAT'S
MY GUT.
THIS IS A MILLION DOLLAR
DECISION.
IF I SCREW UP THAT, I WOULD
NEVER BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH
MYSELF.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE, JENNA,
MICHAEL, CHELSEA, KELLYN,
SEBASTIAN, AND DONATHAN VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE HAVE OUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
DOMENICK, YOU WIN, AND IN DOING
SO GUARANTEE YOURSELF A SPOT AT
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
TOMORROW NIGHT.
YOU ALSO GAINED THE POWER TO
BRING ONE PERSON WITH YOU, BUT
INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO CAMP,
YOU GUYS ALL GET IN A BOAT FOR
ONE FINAL VISIT TO GHOST ISLAND,
WHERE I'M GUESSING LAUREL,
ANGELA, AND WENDELL PLEAD THEIR
CASE.
YEAH.
IT WAS QUITE AN AFTERNOON.
THE THEME OF THIS SEASON IS ONE
BAD MOVE COULD HAUNT YOU
FOREVER, AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE
PART OF THAT LEGEND.
I WANT TO KNOW THAT UP TO THIS
POINT I HAVE MADE DECISION AFTER
DECISION THE RIGHT WAY.
IT'S TERRIFYING.
IT'S JUST TERRIFYING.
Jeff: SO LAUREL, WHAT WAS
YOUR PLEA?
WHAT CASE DID YOU MAKE TO
DOMENICK?
MY CASE IS DOMENICK HAS MADE
IT CLEAR THAT HE'S TRYING TO
TAKE WENDELL OUT.
IF THAT'S HIS GOAL, I'M NOT THE
PERSON TO DO IT.
ANG IS THE QUEEN OF FIRE AT OUR
CAMP.
SHE TENDS TO THE FIR EVERY
SINGLE DAY AND EVERY NIGHT.
IF HE'S TRYING THE TAKE A SHOT
AT WENDELL, I'M NOT THE PERSON
TO DO IT.
Jeff: ANGELA, WHAT'S YOUR
CASE?
LAUREL IS A TALKER.
SHE HAS JUST AS MANY FRIENDS AND
ALLIES THAT I DO, AND SHE'S
CONVINCING.
SHE'S LIKABLE.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S MADE ANYBODY
MAD.
Jeff: SO YOUR CASE IS IT'S
RISKY TO BRING LAUREL, SHE COULD
BEAT YOU.
ABSOLUTELY, YES.
I DEFINITELY THINK SHE CAN IF
SHE'S UP THERE, SHE'LL BEAT DOM.
Jeff: WENDELL, YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN PRETTY OPEN THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR A
LONG TIME IN THIS GAME.
MY CASE WAS A BIG HUG.
I TOLD MY BRO I LOVE HIM AND I
TOLD HIM I'M GOING TO TRY MY
BEST TO MAKE FIRE TONIGHT.
Jeff: YOU DIDN'T EVEN THINK
THERE WAS CHANCE HE WOULD BRING
YOU.
NOT A CHANCE.
AND I WOULDN'T BRING HIM.
SO I'M GOING TO FIGHT MY BUTT
OFF TONIGHT.
Jeff: DOMENICK, WAS THAT
UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THE TWO OF
YOU THAT IF YOU GOT TO FOUR THIS
IS WHERE WE BREAK UP.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
FOR SO LONG, BUT WE'VE ALSO
TALKED ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO CUT
WHOSE THROAT FIRST, BECAUSE WE
BOTH REALIZE WE'RE PLAYING A
PRETTY DECENT GAME.
THERE'S NO B.S.ING EACH OTHER.
BUT TONIGHT PRESENTS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TAKE ONE
LAST SHOT AT GETTING RID OF THIS
GUY, BUT AS LONG AS I SIT AT THE
PURPLE TABLE, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A GOOD SHOT.
Jeff: I CAN TELL YOU, THAT
BASED ON THE SEAT YOU'RE SITTING
AT, YOU WOULD BE SITTING AT
ORANGE.
YOU GOT ANY PAINT?
Jeff: THAT IS INTERESTING
THAT ON DAY 38 THE ORANGE CURSE
STILL RESONATES ON SOME LEVEL.
THAT COLOR HAS BEEN SCARING
ME FOR THE LAST 38 DAYS, JEFF.
Jeff: SO DOMENICK, YOUR
LAST TASK WAS TO CHOOSE ONE URN
AND BRING IT WITH YOU.
RIGHT.
Jeff: BECAUSE TOMORROW
NIGHT THE VOTES WILL BE PLACED
IN THAT CURSED URN, AND WE WILL
RESOLVE GHOST ISLAND.
WHICH URN DID YOU CHOOSE AND
WHY?
WELL, I BROUGHT THE URN FROM
CAGAYAN, SEASON 28, WHERE WU
COULD HAVE WON LIKE THAT BY
TAKING CASS WITH HIM, AND
INSTEAD HE INSISTED HE WANTED TO
PLAY THIS GAME WITH THE BEST OUT
THERE, AND THAT WAS TONY, AND
THAT REMINDS ME OF MY BUDDY
RIGHT HERE.
IF IT ENDS UP BITING ME IN THE
BUTT THAT I WENT WITH HIM, THE
CURSE WILL CONTINUE, BUT I HAVE
FAITH IN MYSELF, I HAVE FAITH IN
MY GAME.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE THAT FROM YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO LET'S GET TO IT.
DOMENICK, WHO YOU GOING TO TAKE
TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AT FINAL
TRIBAL?
JEFF, IT RESONATED THROUGHOUT
THE DAY, AN I'M MAKING THIS
DECISION BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH
THAT MY GIRL ANG IS GOING TO
GIVE MY FRIEND WENDELL HERE A
RUN FOR HIS MONEY TONIGHT, SO
I'M GOING THE TAKE LAUREL WITH
ME TO FINAL THREE AND I WANT TO
JUST THANK HER NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE
HERE, THEY'VE BEEN GREAT, AND
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY GOT.
Jeff: SO LAUREL, YOU WILL
BE AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
TOMORROW NIGHT.
IT'S A HUGE WEIGHT OFF OF ME.
I'M KIND OF SPEECHLESS RIGHT
NOW.
I'M SO THANKFUL.
AND I'M SO EXCITED.
THANK YOU, DOM.
YOU GOT IT.
APPRECIATE IT.
Jeff: UH-HUH.
SO WE HAVE TWO OF OUR FINAL
THREE.
ANGELA, WENDELL, YOU'RE GOING TO
SHOW DOWN.
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SPOTS AT YOUR
FIRE-MAKING STATIONS.
LANG IS AT PURPLE.
WENDELL IS AT ORANGE.
IF YOU WANT...
I DON'T MAKE THE CALL.
I DON'T CARE WHERE I SIT.
Jeff: LET'S EXPLORE THIS.
YOU DON'T CARE WHERE YOU SIT.
I DATE OF BIRTH CARE WHERE I
SIT.
Jeff: AND YOU DEEPLY CARE
WHERE YOU SIT?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jeff: WELL, IF YOU WANT TO
SWITCH.
IT'S OKAY WITH ME.
THANKS, ANG.
Jeff: IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T
IT?
WENDELL IS PETRIFIED OF ORANGE,
WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
YOU DON'T CARE.
YET BOTH OF YOU HAVE THE SAME
THING AT STAKE, $1 MILLION.
IF IT MAKES HIM FEEL BETTER,
I'M OKAY, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
BOTHER ME.
Jeff: WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUR
THIRD BERN TO JOIN THE FINAL
THREE, WENDELL VERSUS ANGELA,
FIRE-MAKING COMPETITION.
YOU BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF
SUPPLIES.
FIRST ONE TO BUILD A FIRE HIGH
ENOUGH AND HOT ENOUGH TO BURN
THROUGH THE ROPE AND RAISE THE
FLAG WILL JOIN LAUREL AND
DOMENICK AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THE LOSER WILL BECOME THE TENTH
AND FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
YOU GUYS BOTH READY?
GO.
38 DAYS.
FIRE IS A WAY OF LIFE OUT HERE.
TWO VERY SIMILAR APPROACHES OUT
OF THE GATE.
THIS IS IT.
POTENTIALLY A $1 MILLION FIRE
RIGHT HERE.
WENDELL WITHIN QUICKLY STARTS
SHAVING MAGNESIUM.
ANGELA NOW GETTING INTO IT.
THIS COULD GO VERY FAST OR WE
COULD BE HERE A WHILE.
THERE'S A BIT OF A BREEZE.
YOU WANT A SHOT TO PLEAD YOUR
CASE, YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE FIRE
FASTER THAN THE OTHER PERSON.
WENDELL ALREADY TRYING TO GET A
SPARK GOING.
ANGELA STILL SCRAPING, TRYING TO
BUILD A PILE.
QUICKLY WENDELL HAS A FLAME.
WHOA.
BUT IT GOES OUT.
Jeff: THAT WIND IS GOING TO
BE AN OBSTACLE.
ANGELA SPARKING NOW, TRYING TO
GET SOMETHING GOING.
ANGELA'S GOT A LITTLE FIRE.
GO, ANG.
IT GOES OUT.
Jeff: WENDELL SPARKING
AGAIN.
ANGELA SPARKING.
ANGELA HAS A LITTLE FIRE.
CAN SHE KEEP IT GOING.
WENDELL'S GOT FIRE.
ANGELA'S GOES OUTS.
WENDELL'S DOESN'T.
THAT WIND IS BLOWING.
VERY HARD THE CONTAIN THAT FIRE.
THAT TINDER WILL BURN FAST.
HE'S GOT TO GET SOMETHING TO
TAKE.
ONE BIG GUST COULD TAKE IT OUT.
ANGELA STILL FIGHTING.
THAT FLAME HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.
IT'S GOT TO GET HIGH ENOUGH, HOT
ENOUGH, AND BE IN LINE WITH THE
ROPE.
ANGELA STILL WORKING TO GET
SOMETHING GOING.
WENDELL NOW PILING ON.
THAT FLAME IS STARTING TO BURN
TALLER NOW.
ANGELA'S GOT TO GET SOMETHING
GOING.
VERY QUICKLY WENDELL HAS A
DECENT FIRE.
LOOKING OVER AT DOM AS IF TO
SAY, I'LL BE SEEING YOU
MOMENTARILY.
ANGELA TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT
DOES NOT HAPPEN.
SHE'S GOT TO GET SOMETHING
GOING.
WENDELL'S FIRE BURNING TALLER
NOW, BRIGHTER, STARTING TO BURN
THE ROPE.
THE FLAME IS BURNING HOT.
JUST GOT TO BURN THROUGH THAT
ROPE.
THE WIND KEEPS MOVING IT AROUND.
ANGELA NOT GIVING UP, THOUGH,
CONTINUES TO FIGHT.
THAT WIND CONTINUES TO PUSH THAT
FLAME AROUND.
IT'S ON THE ROPE THEN IT'S OFF
THE ROPE.
ANGELA GOING CRAZY NOW TRYING TO
GET IT GOING.
AND THERE IT IS.
WENDELL WITHIN MAKES FIRE.
WENDELL WILL JOIN LAUREL AND
DOMENICK AT THE FINAL THREE
TOMORROW NIGHT AT FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ANGELA BECOMES THE TENTH AND
FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IN A MILLION-DOLLAR FIRE-MAKING
SHOWDOWN.
ANGELA, 38 DAY, A LITTLE SHORT
OF THE GOAL.
IT IS A LONG TIME TO SURVIVE ON
"SURVIVOR."
YOU BECOME THE TENTH AND FINAL
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
YOU NEED BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
ALL RIGHT.
ANG.
SEE YA.
THANKS, BABE.
Jeff: ANGELA, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
GOOD LUCK.
LOVE YOU.
Jeff: LAUREL, DOMENICK,
WENDELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU ACCOMPLISHED WHAT EVERYBODY
WANTS TO ACHIEVE AND VERY FEW
ACTUALLY DO.
YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
TOMORROW NIGHT THE POWER IN THIS
GAME SHIFTS TO THE JURY.
TEN PEOPLE THAT YOU PLAYED
ALONGSIDE AND VOTED OUT WILL
DECIDE WHO THEY THINK IS MOST
DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION
PRIZE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT OUT
HERE.
I HOPE YOU CAN GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU WILL MOST DEFINITELY NEED
IT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
I MADE IT THIS FAR.
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF, BUT MY GOAL
WAS TO WIN.
WHILE I BELIEVED IN MYSELF, IT'S
VERY HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT THAT
I FAILED.
OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY COMES OUT
THE WIN, BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE
WINNER.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS IT, BABY.
I'M NOT GOING TO CRY.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU.
CAN WE ARM WRESTLE OR SOMETHING?
DAY 39, OH, MY GOODNESS.
AS A SUPER FAN, THIS HAS BEEN A
DREAM OF MINE FOR A DECADE
PRETTY MUCH.
IT'S GREAT.
IT'S THE BEST FEELING IN THE
WORLD.
WE'RE ALL DESERVING OF IT.
NOT ONE THAT'S MORE OR LESS.
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.
IT'S GO TIME.
BUT THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE
DONE, AND I THINK I CAN PLEAD MY
CASE AND WIN AGAINST ANYBODY.
I WAS LIKE A SILENT ASSASSIN,
QUIETLY IN CONTROL OF THIS GAME.
I FOUND WAYS TO CONNECTS WITH
ALL THESE PEOPLE ALL THE WHILE
THEY WERE SENT TO THE JURY BASED
ON MY DECISIONS, AND I MADE IT
TO THE END.
SEASON 36, WE LOVE YOU.
39 DAYS.
WOW.
I FEEL LIKE I CAN WIN THIS GAME
IF I BRING MY A GAME.
YES, BAGELS.
FRUIT, VEGGIES.
THIS EVERYTHING IS WE NEED.
IT'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
I LOOK BACK ON DAY TWO OR THREE.
I WAS TERRIFIED.
AND NOW I JUST FEEL SO
CONFIDENT.
GREAT FRIENDS.
CONGRATS.
CHEERS.
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE UNDERDOG.
WHEN YOU'RE THE UNDERDOG, YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
LISTEN TO THAT SIZZLE.
MY CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE
MAKING SURE THE JURY KNOWS THE
MOVES THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING.
CAN I GET SOME?
CHEERS, GUYS.
CHEERS, GUYS, WE EARNED IT.
I PLAYED FROM THE BOTTOM OF
THIS ENTIRE GAME.
I WAS ON A TRIBE THAT GOT
DECIMATED.
IN ORDER TO SAVE MYSELF, I FOUND
PEOPLE THAT WERE WILLING TO WORK
ACROSS TRIBAL LINES AND WORK
WITH THEM.
THOUGH MY GAME WASN'T AS FLASHY,
MOST OF THE JURY VOTES CAME DOWN
TO MY DECISION.
I SAVED DOM AND WENDELL MULTIPLE
TIMES.
I PLAYED A HARD GAME.
I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND
FIGHT FOR IT.
SUCH A HUGE SWING BETWEEN
FIRST AND SECOND PLACE.
IT COULD BE A DIFFERENCE OF ONE
VOTE.
ONCE I STEPPED FOOT ON THIS
BEACH, WHAT I REALIZED WAS
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.
ME PLAYING THIS GAME WAS NO MORE
ABOUT ME DOING IT FOR ME.
I OWE IT TO MY FAMILY BACK HOME
TO WIN THIS GAME AND THE $1
MILLION, BECAUSE THEY WERE WITH
ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY OUT
HERE.
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH YOUR
TONE IN FRONT OF THE JURY.
REALLY?
YEAH.
IT'S LIKE HUGE.
I'LL TAKE NOTE.
TONIGHT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.
I KNOW I'M FAR FROM DONE,
BECAUSE I KNOW LAUREL'S THE LAST
MALOLO STANDING.
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF LOVE ON THAT
JURY, AND WENDELL SCARES THE
HELL OUT OF ME.
THIS WENDELL GUY IS GOING TO
GIVE ME TROUBLE TONIGHT.
I KNOW IT.
BUT THIS IS SEASON 36, AND
JURIES RESPECTED GREAT GAME
PLAY.
IT IS GAME TIME, KIDS.
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT I HAD
THE BEST GAME PLAY OUT HERE.
I THINK I HAD THE ABILITY TO
EXPLAIN THAT AND JUSTIFY IT TO
THIS JURY, BUT I HOPE MY EDGE
ISN'T TOO SHARP, BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO COME OFF IN A WAY THAT'S
LIKE, I'M BETTER THAN YOU.
I KICKED YOUR AS.
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST PART.
THIS IS WHAT 39 DAYS OF WORK,
EFFORT, AND ENERGY HAS COME DOWN
TO IS THIS ONE NIGHT.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN
EPIC TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I KNOW
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ONE FOR
THE AGES.
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ONE FOR
THE AGES.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
CHRIS, LIBBY, DESIREE, JENNA,
MICHAEL, CHELSEA, KELLYN,
SEBASTIAN, DONATHAN, AND ANGELA.
ALL RIGHT.
SO LAUREL, DOMENICK, WENDELL,
YOU'VE OUTLASTED 17 OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE GAME, SURVIVED 39 DAYS.
YOU'VE DEALT WITH SWITCHES AND
TWISTS.
THERE WAS GHOST ISLAND AND
CURSES TO REVERSE.
BUT HERE WE ARE.
FOR THE JURY, IT'S A PROCESS OF
DISCOVERY FOR YOU TO GET ALL THE
FACTS SO YOU CAN WRITE THE NAME
OF THE PERSON YOU BELIEVE PLAYED
THE BEST GAME AND PLACE IT IN
THE URN THAT DOMENICK BROUGHT
BACK FROM GHOST ISLAND TO FINISH
OUT THIS SEASON.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
Jeff: OKAY, FIRST PORTION
OF "SURVIVOR" IS THE OUTWIT PART
OF THE GAME, THE SOCIAL PART OF
THE GAME, ALLIANCES, ANY ETHICAL
OR MORAL DILEMMAS, THE LINES YOU
MIGHT HAVE CROSSED.
KELLYN, GET US STARTED WITH THE
SOCIAL PART OF THE GAME.
HI, EVERYONE.
CONGRATULATIONS ON SITTING THERE
AND NOT HERE.
IN SOME WAYS WE ALL ENVY YOU,
AND IN OTHER WAYS I'M GLAD THAT
I'M NOT THE THREE OF YOU TONIGHT
BECAUSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE COMING
YOUR WAY.
SO I'D LIKE THE HEAR WHAT YOUR
PLAN WAS COMING IN AND HOW YOU
THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY
THE GAME SOCIALLY WITH ALLIANCES
AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING.
LAUREL, DO YOU MIND STARTING?
YEAH, COMING INTO THE GAME I
CAME IN AS AN ATHLETE AND I
PLANNED TO PLAY A REALLY
PHYSICAL, AGGRESSIVE GAME.
UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS ON MALOLO,
AND I WAS PUT IN A POSITION
WHERE I WAS PLAYING FROM THE
BOTTOM FROM DAY ONE.
SO I MANAGED TO USE MY SOCIAL
GAME THE FIND A WAY TO HANG IN
THERE VOTE AFTER VOTE AFTER
VOTE.
I ALIGNED WITH TWO OF THE MOST
POWERFUL PLAYERS IN THE GAME, SO
I DIDN'T PLAN COMING INTO THIS
GAME FOR MY GAME TO BE LARGELY
SOCIAL, BUT IT ABSOLUTELY WAS.
FOR THE RECORD, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CREDIT, NOT ONLY WERE YOU IN
MALOLO AND DOWN ON NUMBERS, YOU
WERE THE ONLY ONE OF THE THREE
ON ALL FOUR TIMES.
YOU WERE PUT IN A HARDER SOCIAL
POSITION HAVING TO MAKE NEW
RELATIONSHIPS EVERY COUPLE DAYS,
BUT YOU WERE GLUEDED TO TWO OF
THEM, LETTING THEM PAVE THE WAY.
I WANT THE CLARIFY, I DON'T
THINK I RODE WITH THEM.
IF YOU THINK THEIR MOVES WERE
GREAT, I WAS PART OF ALL THEIR
MOVES.
WE ALWAYS FELT LIKE WE HAD A
LITTLE POWER IN THIS GAME
BECAUSE WE COULD SWITCH IT UP
WHEN WE WANTED TO.
I THINK THEY WERE FLASHIER
ABOUT IT AND SMOKE MORE ABOUT IT
AT TRIBAL, BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE
HERE WITHOUT ME.
DES CAME TO ME WITH A PLAN.
I EXPOSED IT TO SAVE MYSELF, TO
GET MYSELF ONE STEP FURTHER AWAY
FROM THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
JUST PUTTING ONE MORE PERSON
IN FRONT OF YOU IS NOT REALLY
ANYTHING TO BRAG ABOUT.
YOU KNEW THAT THESE TWO WERE A
HUGE PROBLEM THAT NEEDED TO BE
SEPARATED.
YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE A
HUGE MOVE, AND TO OBTAIN POWER
AND TO REALLY SWITCH THE GAME
UP.
BUT I WASN'T SCARED TO MAKE
BIG MOVES.
I WAS RECEPTIVE TO PLENTY OF
OPTIONS.
WITH THESE GUYS I WAS IN THE TOP
OF THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE.
I'M NOT DUMB.
I KNOW THAT SITTING NEXT TO
THESE GUYS IS THE TOUGHEST
COMPETITION OUT HERE.
I DO THINK THAT DOM PLAYED
THE BEST SOCIAL GAME.
HE HAD PRETTY STRONG
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OF US.
HE WAS ALWAYS HAVING
CONVERSATIONS.
WENDELL, YOU AND I ALSO HAD
GREAT CONVERSATION, BUT I FEEL
AS THOUGH YOU WERE ALWAYS OFF
MAKING YOUR NEXT CREATION OR
WHATEVER IT WAS, WHILE, YOU
KNOW, MAYBE DOM WAS OUT
CONNECTING WITH SOMEBODY.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT DOMENICK
IS A BIG TALKER.
HE'S A NEW YORK GUY.
HE'S THE DOMENICK SHOW.
I THINK CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD
WITH PEOPLE WERE SUPER GENUINE,
LIKE WE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
I TALKED TO LIBBY ABOUT HER LOVE
FOR FOOD, SO I TRIED THE MAKE
HER A WHOLE PANTRY.
DES AND I ARGUED NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT ABOUT KANYE VERSUS CHANCE
THE RAPPER VERSUS OTHER RAPPERS.
YES, I TOOK MYSELF OUT OF THE
GAME FOR SOME MENTAL SPACE, BUT
I ALSO INVESTED A LOT OF TIME
AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS IN THE
GAME.
I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU
OFF OF A MUSIC CONVERSATION.
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME JUST A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WHERE YOU WERE
DIGGING DEEP AND DOING ALL THIS
STUFF, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
OKAY.
WELL, ANG CAME TO ME ON THE
SECOND DAY AND SAID, WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?
WE'RE THINKING DOM.
AND I'M LIKE, WHOA, THIS IS DAY
NUMBER THE WORK AND WE'RE
ALREADY THROWING NAMES OUT
THERE.
IT'S "SURVIVOR."
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS,
ALL I DID WAS DAMAGE CONTROL TO
PROTECT THIS GUY, MY BROTHER,
FROM MR. NOBLE.
FROM DAY ONE CHRIS AND COME WERE
AFTER EACH OTHER.
I THOUGHT I COULD FIND A WAY TO
BRING THESE TWO GUYS TOGETHER.
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT HERE
ON OUR THREE.
THAT'S NOW HOW IT WOULD HAVE
WORKED.
HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS, IF YOU
WANT THAT $1 MILLION, SOMEONE
NEEDS TO TELL ME WHO IS THE REAL
MASTERMIND IN THIS ALLIANCE?
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I WAS
THE MASTERMIND.
I WAS THE --
 GO AHEAD.
MAY I FINISH?
LET ME HEAR IT.
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WAS THE
MASTERMIND.
I HAD THIS ALLIANCE OF FIVE.
IT LASTED THREE DAYS.
THIS ALLIANCE OF FIVE.
BUT GO AHEAD.
LET'S HEAR HIM FIRST.
SURE.
THE ALLIANCE OF FIVE, NOTHING
HAPPENED TO THEM BECAUSE WE KEPT
WINNING.
WHEN THE SWAP HAPPENED, THAT'S
WHEN I PULL IN LAUREL.
YOU?
I HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH
LAUREL.
LAUREL, WHO PULLED YOU IN?
DOMENICK CAME US TO FOUR
MALOLO AND SAID, I'M WILLING TO
SLIP AND LET'S GET ANGELA OUT.
WE GOT NERVOUS AND DECIDED TO GO
WITH MORGAN AND THAT'S WHY
MORGAN WENT DOWN.
THANK YOU, DONATHAN.
THAT'S TRUE.
I APPRECIATE THAT, THANK YOU.
CHRIS, THERE IS NO MASTERMIND.
LET'S STOP WITH THE NONSENSE.
DO I LOOK LIKE THE TYPE OF
PERSON THE TAKE ORDERS FROM
ANYBODY?
WENDELL MAY HAVE SAID, DOM, YOUR
NAME IS FLOATING AROUND.
THIS WAS ON DAME TWO.
BUT CHRIS NOBLE WAS ON MY TEAM,
AND I WENT VICTORY AFTER VICTORY
AFTER VICTORY, AND THE ONE
CHALLENGE WE LOST, LUCKILY FOR
ME, HE GETS SENT TO GHOST
ISLAND.
SO I APPROACHED DONATHAN.
I APPROACHED LAUREL.
I APPROACHED LIBBY.
I APPROACHED THEM.
I SAID, I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH
YOU.
THEY FOOLED THE HELL OUT OF ME.
THEY VOTED MORGAN OUT.
IT WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE.
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT CAME DOWN.
TO THERE WAS NO MASTERMIND HERE.
I MADE EVERY DECISION FOR MYSELF
FROM THE START, DAY ONE OF THIS
GAME UNTIL THIS MOMENT THAT I'M
SITTING HERE.
SO IF ANYONE FEELS LIKE THEY
WORKED WITH THE DOM AND WENDELL
SHOW THROUGHOUT THIS GAME, CAN
YOU PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND?
IN ONE WORD, WHO BROUGHT YOU IN
TO WORK WITH THE DOM AND WENDELL
SHOW, DOM OR WENDELL?
LAUREL?
I BELIEVE THAT I APPROACHED
THEM.
I DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE OF THEM
THAT BROUGHT ME IN.
OKAY.
THAT WORKS.
GO AHEAD.
DOMENICK.
IT WAS COME OF COURSE FOR ME
TOO.
WENDELL.
SO I STUCK WITH WENDELL.
DOMENICK FOR ME.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU GUYS PROVED FORWARD AND YOU
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER.
SO I NEED ONE OF YOU TO LIKE
BURY THE OTHER ONE, BECAUSE I
THOUGHT FOR SURE YOU HAD TO
KNOCK EACH OTHER OFF.
IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS FOR BOTH
OF YOU TO SIT THERE.
YOU THINK I WANT TO COMPETE
AGAINST HIM?
I EVEN TALKED TO HIM.
I'M LIKE, BRO, WHEN ARE WE
TAKING EACH OTHER OUT.
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GO TOGETHER,
AND IT DIDN'T FALL INTO PLACE.
THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY.
HE HAD AN IDOL, AND I HAD AN
IDOL.
SO WE JUST ACCEPTED THE FACT
THAT, LOOK, LET'S JUST WORK
TOGETHER TO THE END.
BUT I WILL SAY, IF I HAD A SHOT
AT HIM AT FINAL FIVE, I WOULD
HAVE RALLY THE TROOPS TO GET HIS
ASS OUT OF HERE.
PART OF MY STRATEGY WAS TO
SIT BECOME AND LET DOM BE THE
DOM SHOW.
IN TRIBAL COUNCILS YOU'LL ALWAYS
HEAR DOM.
WHEN WE GET BACK, YOU'LL ALWAYS
SEE DOM.
SOME OF HIS NEAT RICKS KIND OF
HURT PEOPLE.
AND, YES, I MADE SOME DIFFICULT
MOVES, BUT I REALLY JUST TRIED
TO BE A LOVER OUT HERE.
I REALLY DID.
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU SAT
BECOME AND LET HIM DO ALL THE
WORK AND PISS PEOPLE OFF, WHICH
IS HARD, YOU KNOW TO, HANDLE IN
"SURVIVOR."
THANK YOU FOR, THAT BECAUSE
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT DOMENICK
DID EVERYTHING, BUT I KNEW A LOT
OF HEAT WAS ON ME.
I SAW MY NAME A FEW TIMES.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE MOVES
ON THE LOW.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE OUTPLAY
PORTION OF THE GAME.
THIS IS CAMP LIFE, CHALLENGES,
FINDING IDOLS, SWITCHES, TWISTS.
LAUREL, PITCH YOUR CASE THAT YOU
OUTPLAYED THE OTHER TWO WHEN IT
COMES TO THE OUTPLAY PORTION OF
THE GAME.
I WON A CHALLENGE, AND THE
CHANGES THAT I DIDN'T WIN I WAS
ALWAYS IN THE RUNNING FOR.
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE WITH ME
IS I NEVER FELT LIKE I HAD TO
WIN A CHALLENGE TO SAVE MY GAME.
I THINK IF YOU WERE RELYING ON A
CHALLENGE TO SAVE YOUR GAME
YOU'RE, DOING SOMETHING WRONG.
ONCE WE GOT TO THE END GAME, I
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IF I DIDN'T WIN
IMMUNITY I WAS GOING HOME
BECAUSE I HAD POSITIONED MYSELF
IN A POSITION WHERE I WAS SAFE.
Jeff: WENDELL?
OKAY.
AS BRIEFLY AS I CAN I'LL TRY THE
TALK ABOUT CAMP LIFE.
IT WAS PART OF MY STRATEGY TO
MAKE IT A MORE COMFORTABLE
SITUATION SO WE CAN BE HAPPIER
AND WE'RE ALL PERFORMING A LOT
BETTER.
SO I BUILT SEATING, A TOOL SHED
FOR THE FELLAS.
I BUILT THREE BEDS.
WENDELL, I THINK WE'RE ALL IS
THANKFUL THAT WE HAD YOU AROUND
CAMP TO DO EVERYTHING YOU DID.
IT WAS AMAZING TRULY.
BUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BOTH OF
YOUR IDOL DYNAMICS, WHO KNEW
WHAT, WAS WHAT WAS FAKE, WHAT
YOU MADE.
I THINK WE'RE ALL CURIOUS WHAT
HAPPENED.
AS FAR AS IDOLS ARE
CONCERNED, I THINK IDOL
MANAGEMENT IS ALSO A KEY
COMPONENT OF THIS GAME.
I FOUND AN IDOL, AND I DIDN'T
HAVE TO USE IT.
YOU GUYS KNOW ME AND LAUREL WERE
WORKING TOGETHER A LOT.
SO I WAS ABLE TO PROTECT LAUREL
WITH MY IDOL.
THAT'S THE KIND OF MOVE I MADE.
I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD TO
PROVE MY LOYALTY TO LAUREL.
THE LOYALTY PITCH DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME.
I MAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
I DON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT.
THAT'S FINE.
I APPROPRIATE THAT YOU JUDGE ME
ON OTHER MERITS AND ME SAYING I
WAS A LOYAL PLAYER.
CAN I?
GO AHEAD.
FROM AN IDOL PERSPECTIVE.
I'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT I
THINK WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE BEST
MOVES THIS GAME'S SEEN, AND THAT
WAS THE NIGHT OF THE SEBASTIAN
VOTE.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND THE NEAT RICKS OF IT
THAT WENT DOWN, BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT IT LOOKED DISTASTEFUL TO A
LOT OF YOU WHEN I PULLED OUT TWO
IDOLS --
DISTASTEFUL IS ONE WORD.
YEAH.
I HAVE A LOT TO SAY TO YOU,
BUDDY.
AND WE CAN GET INTO IT, AND
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHY
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.
SO WHAT WAS MOST CRITICAL TO ME
WAS THAT I PRESERVED MY REAL
IDOL FOR FINAL FIVE.
SO I CALLED SEBASTIAN AND
DONATHAN OUT ON THIS PLAN
AGAINST ME, WHICH WAS GOING TO
BE EXECUTED THAT NIGHT.
SO IT WAS MY JOB TO CHANGE THE
FATE OF THAT.
IS THAT WHAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN?
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN, BUT THE WAY YOU DID IT,
YOU AND WENDELL PUT YOUR
BLING BLING ON.
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.
EVERYONE ON THIS JURY IS LIKE,
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
AGREED.
WILL YOU LET HIM FINISH.
I'M SORRY.
WE WERE BROTHERS.
I WAS GOING TO VOTE YOU OUT, BUT
THAT WAS BRUTAL.
I'M A LOVER, DUDE.
I PLAYED FROM MY HEART.
THAT WAS MY ENTIRE GAME.
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE STRATEGY, YOU
KNOW.
YOU TRIED THE USE MY TRUTH
BOMB, BUT MY TRUTH BOMB WAS MORE
OF AN ATTACK.
IT WAS AN ACT.
HAVE I EVER BEEN THAT AGGRESSIVE
IN THIS GAME TO ANYONE?
YES.
REALLY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE MOST OF YOUR GAME
WAS A BIT OF AN ACT.
I'M HURT BY THAT, BECAUSE I
MEAN, I HAD AN OBJECTIVE.
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD HAVE
SOLD IT.
I NEEDED TO PRETEND THAT THIS
FAKE IDOL HAD POWER AND THAT
CONVINCED YOU.
IT WORKED.
IT WORKED.
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.
I AM NOT AN EVIL, MALICIOUS
PERSON.
I DON'T HAVE A MALICIOUS BONE IN
MY BODY.
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AT HOME.
THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S ME.
AND I'M SORRY.
I REALIZE IT WAS AGGRESSIVE AND
ABRASIVE, AND I GET IT, BUT THAT
TO ME WAS A HUGE MOVE.
IT'S A MILLION DOLLAR GAMBLE.
NO ONE GOT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO
DO.
I THOUGHT ANYONE UP THERE WAS
FAN OF THE GAME WOULD APPRECIATE
IT.
FOR THE RECORD, I THOUGHT
THAT FROM A GAME STANDPOINT
STRATEGY-WISE, IT WAS BRILLIANT,
BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE SWAYED
SEBASTIAN'S MIND KNOWING YOU
WERE GUARANTEED FINAL FIVE.
AND I HAD A REAL IDOL TO PLAY AT
FIVE AND IT'S A GOOD THING I
HAD, BECAUSE THIS GUY WON THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, AND THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS CHANCE THE
TAKE ME OUT.
FOR ME PERSONALLY, DOM, YOU
AND I HAVE BEEN AT IT SINCE DAY
ONE, BUT THERE IS A MUTUAL
RESPECT I HAVE BECAUSE YOU DID
PLAY YOU ASS OFF.
YOU PLAYED THE GAME HARD.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE GOING THE MOVE TO THE
LAST PORTION, WHICH IS THE
OUTLAST.
IT COMES BACK TO YOU GUYS.
DID YOU PUT THE PEOPLE ON THE
JURY WHO RESPECT YOUR GAME MORE
THAN THE OTHER TWO?
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO
CONVINCE THEM.
LAUREL, YOU'RE UP?
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
GUYS VIEW MY MISTAKE AS TAKING
THESE GUYS TO THE END.
AND IN THE MAKING A MOVE AGAINST
THEM WHEN I HAD MULTIPLE CHANCES
TO DO SO.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE CRAVING THE
BIG MOVE, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXCITING TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE
GAME.
THAT'S A BIG MOVE THAT WOULD
HAVE BENEFITED PROBABLY EVERY
ONE OF YOU BUT WOULD NOT HAVE
BENEFITED ME.
IF THEY GO OUT AT NINE OR EIGHT
OR SEVEN, I'M THE NEXT TO GO AND
I HAVE NO OPTIONS TO GET TO THE
END.
I GOT TO FINAL FIVE.
AND WENDELL PLAYED HIS IDOL ON
ME.
NOT BECAUSE I WASN'T A THREAT,
BUT OUT OF LOYALTY AND OUT OF
THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE
DEVELOPED.
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THAT WOULD
HAVE DONE THAT FOR ME IF I HAD
TAKEN THEM OUT.
THAT SECURED ME A SPOT IN THE
FINAL FOUR.
SO I UNDERSTAND THE CRAVING FOR
A BIG MOVE, BUT FOR ME I HAD TO
GO WITH THE SMART MOVE THAT GAVE
ME A CHANCE TO GET TO THE END.
Jeff: DOMENICK?
SO I REALIZED A LOT OF THINGS
I DID WAS UNPOPULAR, THAT I HURT
PEOPLE OUT HERE, I WANT YOU ALL
TO KNOW WHEN I SPEAK, I'M
SPEAKING WITH CONFIDENCE AND
PASSION.
I DON'T WANT IT TO COME OFF AS
HARSHNESS OR BRASHNESS OR
ARROGANCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BECAUSE I PLAYED A HELL OF A
GAME, AND I KNOW IT, AND I OWN
IT, AND I OWN EVERY MOVE I'VE
DONE.
I WORE THAT NECKLACE THREE
TIMES.
I FOUND TWO RELICS OUT HERE.
ONE WAS REAL, ONE WAS FAKE.
I THINK THE FAKE ONE I PUT TO
GOOD USE, AS UNPOPULAR AS IT MAY
HAVE BEEN.
JUST VOTE WITH YOUR HEART
TONIGHT AND REMEMBER THAT IT'S
ABOUT WHO PLAYED THE BEST GAME,
NOT NECESSARILY WHO MADE THE
NICEST FURNITURE OR WHO DID THIS
OR DID THAT.
IT'S ABOUT OWNING YOUR MOVES AND
PLAYING YOUR HEART OUT OUT HERE.
I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DID AND I'M
PROUD OF WHAT I BROUGHT TO THE
GAME.
Jeff: WENDELL?
OKAY.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THANK YOU
GUYS FOR LETTING ME COME OUT
HERE AND LIVE THIS DREAM.
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I WANTED
TO BRING THE TRUE UNIQUE PIECES
OF ME OUT HERE.
I WANTED TO BUILD SOME THINGS.
I WANTED TO BE A GUY WHO IS KIND
OF ATHLETIC, KIND OF SOCIAL,
KIND OF SMART.
I WANTED TO MESH ALL OF THESE
PIECES OF THE TRUE ME, AND I
ALSO WANTED TO PUT MY HEART OUT
THERE AND LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO I
AM.
I TRIED TO PLAY A CLEAN GAME,
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT I'M STILL APOLL JETTEDDIC
FOR, BUT AS A WHOLE, I HOPE YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE
PLAYERS IN THIS GAME THAT MAKE
SOME COOL MOVES THAT PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO SEE, AND THERE ARE
PLAYERS THAT REALLY THOUGHT
THINGS THROUGH AND MADE VERY
STRATEGIC MOVES.
ONCE AGAIN I JUST THANK YOU FOR
THIS OPPORTUNITY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
JURY, NICE JOB GATHERING
INFORMATION.
LAUREL, DOMENICK, WENDELL,
HANDLED YOURSELVES VERY WELL.
THERE IS ONE THING LEFT TO DO.
JURY, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A
MOMENT TO TAKE IN EVERYTHING
YOU'VE HEARD, AND THEN WE WILL
VOTE.
OKAY.
WE ARE THERE.
FINAL TRIBAL.
THIS IS IT.
WE DID THIS LAST YEAR, AND WE
HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH A GIRL
NAMED AVA.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I'M SAMANTHA.
.
Jeff: OKAY, SAMANTHA LAST
TIME AVA PREDICTED WHO SHE
THOUGHT WOULD WIN.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE PARCH.
BY THE WAY, SHE GOT IT RIGHT.
HERE'S YOUR PEN.
KEEP IT A SECRET.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, ANYBODY.
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME I COME
BACK, I'M GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE
WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST
ISLAND," AND WE'LL SEE IF YOU
GOT IT RIGHT OR NOT, NO
PRESSURE.
AVA GOT IT RIGHT.
CAN SAMANTHA GET IT RIGHT?
HOLD IT UP.
KEEP IT A SECRET.
WE'LL COME BACK LATER.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST
ISLAND" COMING UP RIGHT AFTER
THIS.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
JURY, AFTER 39 DAYS, IT COMES
DOWN TO THIS: WHO DO YOU FEEL IS
MOST DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF
SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION
PRIZE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT?
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.
JENNA, YOU'RE UP.
I'M NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON TO
GET MY FEELINGS HURT.
I RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF YOU.
YOU DESERVE TO WIN THIS GAME.
WENDELL, YOU DESERVE THIS.
WENDELL, YOU PLAYED A
PHENOMENAL GAME, BUT DOM, I HAVE
A RESPECT FOR YOU.
YOU PLAYED BETTER THAN EVERYONE
ELSE.
YOU DESERVE THIS.
DOM, I THINK YOU WERE THE
BRAWN BEHIND THE OPERATION, BUT
I THINK WENDELL WAS THE
STRATEGIST AND THE BRAINS ALL
ALONG.
Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE
VOTES.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S OVER.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO READ THE VOTES.
WHAT?
WHAT?
I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: FIRST VOTE DOMENICK.
WENDELL.
DOMENICK.
TWO VOTES DOMENICK.
WENDELL.
TWO VOTES DOMENICK, TWO VOTES
WENDELL.
DOMENICK.
THAT'S THREE VOTES DOMENICK.
WENDELL.
DOMENICK.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES DOMENICK.
TIED AGAIN.
FOUR VOTES DOMENICK, FOUR VOTES
WENDELL.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES DOMENICK.
FOUR VOTES WENDELL.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
WENDELL.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 36 SEASONS
OF "SURVIVOR," WE HAVE A TIE.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IN A TIE.
THE PERSON WHO IS NOT TIED,
LAUREL, YOU BECOME THE 11th
AND FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
AND YOU WILL CAST THE DECIDING
VOTE.
LAUREL, COME GRAB THE URN, AND
MAKE YOUR VOTE.
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
NO THANK YOU.
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOSH.
OH, MY GOSH.
Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE VOTE.
I HATE THAT I HAD TO DO THAT,
YOU GUYS.
WHAT A CRAZY ENDING TO THIS
STORY.
Jeff: THIS VOTE I'LL SAVE.
THANK YOU FOR A GREAT SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."
I WILL SEE YOU BACK IN THE
STATES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: THAT'S FOR YOU GUYS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: THAT'S FOR YOU GUYS.
HAVE A SEAT.
HAVE A SEAT.
WOW.
OKAY.
JURY, HISTORY.
THE FIRST TIME, A TIE VOTE, IT
SPEAKS TO TRULY A GREAT SEASON.
I WAS A WITNESS TO IT.
THEY WERE A WITNESS TO IT.
AND ULTIMATELY A VERY
COMPETITIVE BATTLE THAT ENDED UP
COMING DOWN TO DOM AND WENDELL
TIED, FIVE VOTES EACH.
LAUREL, WHO WAS WITH YOU EVERY
STEP OF THE WAY, LEFT TO CAST
THE DECIDING VOTE, A $1 MILLION
VOTE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THERE
IS ONLY ONE VOTE IN HERE.
LY -- I WILL READ IT.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST
ISLAND,"
WENDELL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
WENDELL HOLLAND IS THE WINNER OF
OUR 36th SEASON, MOST
DRAMATIC FINISH IN "SURVIVOR"
HISTORY.
WENDELL, COME OVER HERE.
