        Previously on "Survivor":
Here on Samoa,
the purple tribe, Galu, has been on a roll.
Galu wins!
Winning all three immunity challenges.
At camp, most of the tribe kicked back and relaxed
while Shambo did most of the works.
I'm not doing the warm and fuzzy, 
I'm doing the Rambo Shambo provider role out here.
In a twist, Shambo was sent to observe the other tribe.
We call you "Mick Dreamy".
She immediately bonded with everyone.








At Foa Foa, Russell was a force to be reckoned with.
I'm running this whole show right now.
He constantly manipulated the others to further his own ends.
I'm gonna have them all under control, like zombies walking around.
As the yellow tribe was preparing to go to 
their third tribal council in a row, 
If I was a girl, I would slap you.
Jaison got furious with Ben
because of his racially insensitive comments.
Jaison wanted Ben out but Russell didn't agree.
Right now I think I need Ben.
At tribal council, Ben wouldn't back down.
She's from the ghetto and she's trashy, that's ghetto trash.
That's not racial.








So Jaison stood up to him.
If what you're telling me is that what you said had no racial context,
then maybe you're ignorant.
During the confrontation,
Russell realized his best play was to vote off Ben.
I didn't want to have to do this, man.
Ben became the fourth member of Foa Foa
to leave the game.
Now the tribe is down in numbers and morale.
16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
What happened at tribal council was
me trying to let Ben know how I felt.
I cannot handle people who use terms and phrases
that are meant to hurt on a very basic level.
I think, Jaison, there is room here too.
Oh man.
I'm hungry. I'm tired.
I came here to have an adventure
but frankly,
I right now believe that coming here
was the worst decision I'd made in my entire life.
It's not only physically tough, it's mentally tough.
In fact it demands your body and your soul.
Coming back from tribal council last night,
Jaison was really upset with Ben.
He took things very personal.
I really think if Ben would've stayed, Jaison would've quit the game.
Now, what kind of man is that?
Now I'm willing to get rid of Jaison.
And whoever I want to be going is gonna be going.
I got it all under my thumb right now.
I got back at Galu last night, and I'm not happy
because when I went over to Foa Foa
there was a huge appreciation for Shambo.
Huge appreciation.
Their camp is amazing, you guys.
Fresh water, white sand beaches.
No worry if you go barefoot.
Everybody over there loves me.
I feel ten times closer to Foa Foa than I do Galu
because Galu, they just want to lay on the beach and gossip.
So I have no problem going to Foa Foa
because I already have a following there and 
if I can make it to the merge,
I know damn well I got their votes.
So, I'm way ahead.
Yasmin got a clue for the immunity idol.
OK.
You got a clue for the immunity idol.
Absolutely.
Wherever the Immunity Idol is on their beach, it's probably on our beach.
Nobody really had talked to Shambo last night
about the second clue to the immunity idol, right?
So I come up with this little idea to find out all the information I want to get from her.
If I can find the immunity idol,
I can give it to you if you're in danger.
Yup.
At least you have that.
I'm like 30 seconds away from nailing all the information I want to get from her,
here comes John.
And he starts sort of "Hey, Shambo, here is a brilliant idea".
You had a clue and Yasmin had a clue.
I got her clue and my clue.
What was the Yasmin's clue?
Yasmin's clue was...
"You will find what you seek in a bark".
And the second one is: "It's low to the ground".
Those are the exact words.
And if it comes down to Jury Tribal,
you guys better give me the votes for giving you the honesty on this question.
And if you don't, bad on you. Gotta go.
I don't feel like I had hurt myself in the game in any way
by sharing knowledge with them.
That didn't do nothing but help me going forward.
And maybe it wouldn't.
Maybe it will hurt me. We'll see.
Tree mail.
It says:
The chief must choose two
to join him on a quest
to go on a special mission
which could turn out for the best.
And when your chief comes home
your tribe might have more to eat
but you wouldn't know why until the mission is complete.
It states here it wants one guy and one girl.
We just got some tree mail
and it said that I need you to choose two people to go on a mission
which may or may not lead us to having a little bit more food.
Obviously we want to bring people who are strong in some sort of challenge situation.
So I'll be taking Russell,
because he is good at strategizing.
And Natalie is good with puzzles, things of that nature.
So I thought it's perfect.
Everybody comfortable with this?
Yeah, that's fine.
Let's do this.
I had to choose two people to go on a quest with me.
So I took Shambo and Dave,
because I need some brain and some firepower.
Here comes the Foa Foa.
So we were just standing there looking at each other...
you know, we were waiting for Jeff.
Because at every challenge so far, Jeff had already been there.
So we were like "what do we do?".
So, what's going on?
I don't know.
Chickens
Oh my god...
Who knows what's in that box?
It's probably rice and beans.
Oh, if you catch the chickens, you get the pirate chest for food.
Maybe so.
I think that's what it is.
I think so too.
What if we're supposed to jump, like just get over here and start doing stuff
without even asking.
Wait.
A reward challenge.
For today's challenge, you're left on your own to battle for reward. Inside this box...
Certainly it was on. The frenzy was on.
Shambo grabbed a chicken.
We jumping into the treasure box
and it got all these coloured balls and it got some instructions.
Alright Sham, the rewards cannot be opened
and shared between the tribes.
Sham, put those chickens back and come on back.
Put the chickens back. Quick.
OK, so what's the deal?
For today's challenge, you're left on your own 
to battle for reward.
Inside this box are a flag
and three tribe coloured balls for each player.
One player will place the flag in the center of the beach.
One at a time, you will toss a ball toward the flag.
The object is to land the ball closest to the flag.
Once all the balls have been thrown, the ball closest to the flag wins.
Bocce ball.
Reward challenge. Awesome.
The game is basically Bocce ball.
The tribe that wins get to take these chickens home.
So we will start with the chiefs.
So you start first, then I start.
Chiefs first, ladies second, and the esteemed gentlemen
third time. Alright.
Alright, let's do this.
Let's go, Mick.
Oh, good shot, Mick.
Good job.
You got us some chickens.
That's a good one too.
So close.
Yes!
Oh suck.
Russell's ball knocked mine closer and 
I could taste the chicken in my mouth.
Good shot, Mick.
Stay out of his way now.
Make sure you don't hit it.
Mick had thrown his last two balls so close to the stick.
My goal was to not even get close to him
because I don't wanna mess anything up.
Oh no, sorry guys.
Alright, you're up.
I'm gonna knock him out of there.
Get one in.
Oop, too strong.
Aim right for that stick.
Oh my god, what a miss.
Try knocking his out.
That's what I'm going for.
Oh, Shannon Lee!
Lord, have mercy.
We were panicking all over the place.
Shambo was like no good.
So now it's between Russell from Foa Foa and Dave.
And each has three chances to win this game.
Russell, we need you.
Good job, Russell.
Alright, you're up, Dave.
Not bad, not bad.
Yes, that puts two in the way.
Alright Russell, knock it easy.
Don't knock anything out
You got it, man.
Nice shooting, Texas.
That might get it done, so you're gonna have to get at the stick.
Just drop it on it.
Alright.
So Dave got his final ball.
We have the closest ball to the flag.
I'm looking over to the chickens like I'm stoic.
There is finally something we're gonna bring back.
We are finally going to win.
Come on, Dave.
You can do it.
Alright, so this one wins, Dave.
The last ball is on me. Make it or break it.
At this point, we are not going home with the chickens.
Yes!
Good game. Good game.
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, man. It's so demoralizing.
I'm just so tired losing to these guys.
It totally split me in half to see Galu walk out with those chickens.
It's so ludicrous
that we can't even pull off freakin' Bocce ball.
Thank goodness Russell didn't take me for the challenge today
because now with him gone
I can get people doing things
working for the tribe
while I stay home and find that immunity idol.
I got 10 minutes to try to find that idol.
Apparently it's in a bark of a tree.
Oh, it's so beautiful.
Of course I'm not gonna tell anybody I've the idol.
But I'm gonna use it down the road.
Maybe around day 30 or 36.
Because I'm planning on being here for a while.
And this is gonna be my ticket.
You're the man, dude. You brought it on home.
Hey man, it was your ball I hit.
Team effort, daddy.
Talking about the chickens, they're heavy, but they're worth
every aching muscle.
Carrying that chicken coop, it felt great coming home.
Every time it scraped against the back of my ankle,
I thought: That's ok.
We're bringing home the bacon, baby.
Do you know anything about chicken, Shannon?
We need somebody that's not going to accidentally let them out.
We're back.
You're home?
We won the challenge.
You did?
We come bearing gifts.
It's Russell.
We're bringing friends.
We're going to have eggs every morning.
We won! We won!
I won chickens.
On the inside...
We win! We win!
Yes!
However, I just tried to stay emotionally settled
and humble within the tribe.
Getting cocky is a quick way to show me the door.
It's over here. Come on.
However, I won chickens.
What do you do? Not that. Peace.
This is Daisy, Ella and Miley.
We lay eggs and like to eat cocoa.
And they gotta have fresh water all the time.
Hey, you're on it.
I already assigned it to you.
I don't claim to be a chicken farmer but 
I was introduced to them at a very young age.
You gotta have a relationship with chickens.
They're very finicky.
They've to trust you, they've to know you, they've to like you.
The Survivor chickens will know Shambo
and they will give me eggs in return because I will be kind to them.
Talking chickens.
Mick, Natalie and Russell, they lost the challenge.
I think normally we're hungry for a win
but I just want to survive for another day.
I'm tired. I'm hungry.
You know, I'm really thirsty.
So for me right now, it doesn't really matter.
My true alliance changes all the time.
I told Jaison I would bring him to the top 2
but I don't know if I can count on Jaison to stay in the game.
I need somebody who can help me to the final 2.
So I'll have to take somebody like Natalie with me,
because she has gone around my coattails the whole way.
She is too stupid to do it by herself.
She needs me.
So I could stand up there and say
she followed my coattails the whole way.
She rode me like a horse.
Day one still exists.
It's gonna be me and you in the final.
You're probably gonna get upset, you're probably gonna cry
because your friends are gonna get their hearts broken
and you're gonna be one of the ones doing it to them.
Russell and I talked since the first day about 
being in the final 2 at the end.
So, at this point, 
I'm kind of his wingman, I guess you could say.
You're good for a long while.
I definitely think people underestimated me
and I want them to think that it's really smart for them to take me to the end
because they can beat me.
You know, I think that's my advantage.
And if it comes down to me or him,
I know I can beat Russell in the very end
because I'd say a lot of other people in the tribe 
had really been rubbed the wrong way by him.
So I'm just trying to not ruffle feathers, steer clear, build good relationships
which is what I'm good at.
Escaped chicken, escaped chicken!
911!
We were all just kinda talking about how everybody was so hungry
when I heard this:
Escaped chicken! Emergency! Escaped chicken!
And, sure enough, Shambo let a chicken get away.
So her and Erik go running around chasing it.
It's like Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum.
Erik, he's running after the chicken,
and he gets clotheslined by a clothesline!
It was pure comedy right there.
Come down. Come here, chicky, chicky.
I didn't know they could frickin' fly.
I'm not calling Shambo stupid,
but it's a bird for crying out loud.
I'd think you, being a country girl, would assume that
something with wings can fly.
So yeah, I was just beyond...
I was stumped.
I don't know where it went.
All you have to do is look at the chicken.
I said I don't know where it went.
She is right there.
Holy crap!
It's up in the tree. It's so high up that...
There is a chicken in the tree..
One of our chickens?
I give you one guess.
Why? Why?
Shambo's feeding it.
Jeez, can I just get a break?
I produced one egg and then I let a chicken get away.
Shambo thinks that she can get the chicken out of the tree
by clucking at it.
Shambo tells me, "I feel really bad,
but at least I produced an egg".
You didn't produce an egg!
The chicken laid an egg!
What did you do to produce the egg, Shambo?
And nobody cares. That's the worst part.
Is anybody looking for the damn chicken? No.
That's the spirit.
Every time I try to take a nap, Erik interrupts.
Alright, I'll be back. Bye.
I'm so sick of Yas doing absolutely nothing.
She's waiting around to be taken care of,
like she is a little princess.
So, she is kind of frustrating and annoying.
I think reason this tribe is working so well is because
we are really focusing on bringing our team 
as strong as possible to the merge.
But Yas is here for herself.
She is not a team player.
She doesn't help out on camp.
And say we do lose challenge,
I think Yas will be the first to go.
Come on in, guys!
Galu, get your first look at the new Foa Foa.
Ben voted out last tribal council.
Alright, you guys ready to get to today's challenge?
First thing first, Brett,
take back immunity ídol.
Thank you.
Once again, the immunity is back up for grab.
For today's challenge,
you'll race across a net run,
carrying wooden blocks.
When you reach the platform,
you must stack the blocks one on top of the other.
Once you completed the stack,
you make your way across a rope bridge to another platform,
where you will find more blocks.
This will stack even higher.
First tribe to get both stacks completed
wins immunity and is safe from the vote.
Losers, tribal council.
Somebody will be voted out of this game.
Galu, you have four extra members,
sitting four people out this challenge. Who is it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit out Sham, Laura, Dave and myself.
Alright, you guys take a spot on the bench.
Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize,
then we will get started.
Here we go. For immunity.
Survivors ready?
Go!
John's out quickly for Galu.
Liz is out for Foa Foa.
Got to make your way across the net run with all your blocks.
Everybody doing very well.
Once all your members are back on the mat, 
you can start stacking.
We are dead even. Go!
I got some big ones. I got some big ones.
You are buidling one tall stack.
One block on top of another.
Foa Foa working quickly
using the height of Jaison.
Galu starts to use a little human pyramid action.
That's thinking, that's teamwork.
Monica now getting up on Erik's shoulders.
Can Galu make it work?
Foa Foa very close.
Once you have it, get back
to your mat.
Monica, Kelly, working together.
Gotta be there until I count to five.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Galu, go!
Foa Foa, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Go!
Come on, John!
You're way ahead, take your time.
Stay on the rope, John. You can do it.
Let's go!
John across the rope bridge quickly for Galu.
Go!
Yasmin on the rope bridge for Galu.
John got across very quickly.
Jaison taking a lot more time.
Liz now on the course.
Good job, Yasmin!
Yasmin extending Galu's lead.
Erik now on the rope bridge for Galu.
Come on, Liz. You can do it, Liz.
Mick on the course now for Foa Foa.
Erik cruising through this. No problem at all.
Monica on the course for Galu.
Go, Mo!
Foa Foa needs to make up some time.
Galu in a big lead.
Come on, Monica, you got it.
Come on, Monica!
Foa, go!
Natalie on the course for Foa Foa.
Monica taking a long time for Galu.
Keep going!
Hurry, baby, hurry!
Natalie is making up the lost time.
Suddenly it is very close again.
Come on, Monica! Come on!
Every second counts in this challenge.
Come on! Damn.
Galu, go!
Foa Foa, go!
Kelly on the course for Galu.
Ashley on the course for Foa Foa.
Ashley is screaming across this rope bridge.
Come on, Kelly, come on! You can do this!
Galu, go!
Let's go, Ashley! Let's go, Ashley!
We are down to the last two members.
Brett for Galu, Russell for Foa Foa.
Look at Russell go.
Russell may pass Brett.
Come on, Brett! You can do it, Brett.
We are very close.
Russell making up a lot of time.
Got to get everybody on the mat.
Go, Galu!
Go, Foa Foa!
Come on, come on!
Got to untie these, and then
stack them just like you did with the other stack.
We are neck-and-neck.
Great competition on the rope bridge.
Foa Foa made up a lot of time.
Galu has their first bag untied.
They're gonna start working on their stack.
Galu has their second bag untied.
Foa Foa, still not untied.
Once again, Galu with the lead.
Looking to win their fourth straight immunity challenge.
You're smoking them! You're smoking them!
Foa Foa has their first bag untied.
This stack will be a lot higher.
On my shoulders, not on my back, Kelly.
On my shoulders, not on my back.
Foa Foa has their second bag untied.
Both tribes now working on their stacks.
Foa Foa picking up their pace now.
Natalie getting on Jaison.
Big height advantage.
We're very close.
Big, big immunity on the line.
Worry about the second stack right now.
Natalie gotta stand up now.
Help me, help me.
I'm doing it the same time.
Foa Foa desperately wants to win.
Foa Foa loses, they will be down to five members.
Galu with their last three blocks.
Kelly has them.
Natalie has the last one for Foa Foa.
Kelly loses two blocks.
Almost there.
No, no, no, no!
Natalie places it for Foa Foa!
Do they have it?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!
Foa Foa wins their first immunity challenge!
Everybody keeps their heads held high.
Foa Foa, congratulations.
Who wants it?
Everybody wants it.
For the first time in this game,
Foa Foa will not be going to tribal council.
Enjoy your night off.
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.
Congratulations.
I don't know if Mother Nature is sending you guys a sign or not,
but there is a big cloud over your head right now.
Should be an interesting afternoon
figuring out who is going home.
Grab your stuff. I will see you at tribal.
I saw Monica basically disappeared at that challenge.
This is Survivor.
This is about physical, mental toughness.
And today, Monica just did not have it.
Alright so, I'm gonna try to get the fire started,
and we will keep moving in group
until it's time to do what we gotta do.
Today we lost our first immunity challenge,
and I just got pissed off.
There is no reason why we should have lost.
We had the lead the whole time.
And then I kinda saw one person kinda fall apart.
And that was Monica.
Talking about challenge,
Monica screwed that up.
No question in my mind.
Terrible.
Pretty young girl, hanging out having a good time.
Like it's like Club Med or something.
As much as I hate to do that...
Yeah.
What do you do about the vote tonight?
I don't know
Well, let's say that Sham's collosal screw-ups
are kind of a shock to the team around.
Are they?
You know what I mean?
I think she does the least out of everyone here.
Yup, exactly.
Is that where we are going, with Yas?
As far as I'm concerned, Yas goes.
We're going to our first tribal council tonight.
Certains names are going about.
For instance, Yas. She doesn't really do anything.
She basically sits by the fire and kind of observes things.
So that kind of gets annoying.
So I think Yas might be going home tonight.
But hey, it's Survivor. Crazier things had happened.
Are you gonna vote Monica out?
She took about 200% longer than anybody to run that rope.
Me and John across that rope first, and fast,
So that's why I'm saying I can't worry about it,
And because I don't want that negativity. Whatever going to happen, going to happen.
But I know
I haven't come out short. I'm sorry.
Exactly.
You know what I'm saying?
And around the camp, I decided to do nothing
because you know what these people do?
they prey on you doing something wrong
like letting the chicken go.
They preyed on that.
See? Therefore, nobody will be preying on me.
I've had my game face on since day 1.
I'm here to play and I did just that.
I've been running with the fellas and helping us win our challenges
and I'm not looking down on nobody. 
But, you know, Monica didn't help us win today.
So if you wanna penalize me for stepping up,
so be it.
Vote me out, because my body could use a rest dammit.
Russ, he sounds dead-set on Monica.
I don't know...
I mean, I like Monica. You know?
There has been a ton of craze talking about voting Yas.
It's true, she doesn't do a lot of works around here
but Yas is completely stronger in challenges than Monica.
Unfortunately, people seem to be rallying behind Monica.
And I don't know how this is gonna play out.
If you decide to go your way with Monica,
you're gonna vote against the leader
which we could do, because we have numbers
but I don't want to be on Russell's bad side.
I am not in the mood to mess with Russell.
Really?
I'm telling you but...
So these people who are gonna vote for Yas,
they basically already have an alliance?
Well, I don't know if it's an alliance
as much as it's like a decision that maybe they don't trust.
So they don't trust me?
You know what I mean, that's what it comes down to.
Boss? Alright.
Yasmin, that's a vote that I absolutely disagree with.
Every time there was a challenge,
Yasmin kicked it up.
Today, Monica dragged her butt.
And right now,
That's it.
I want the strongest tribe 
and I'm the leader, so
these people, they gotta listen to me
or there is gonna be some serious ass-kicking.
Behind each of you is a torch,
go ahead and grab a torch.
Approach the flame, dip it in and get fire.
This is part of the ritual of tribal council 
because in this game, fire represents your life.
As long as you have fire, you're still in the game.
When your fire is gone, so are you.
And that will be the case for one of you tonight.
Galu is gonna vote out the first member.
Shambo, interesting afternoon
knowing you have to come to tribal tonight?
Yeah, everybody was a little uneasy.
There were people going for walks on the beach.
There were a little bit of whispering going on.
It's not good. We don't want to be here.
We're bummed. All of us.
Let's talk about camplife.
Brett, do you think everybody is pulling equal share of the weight?
There is definitely people that are pulling more weight than they should,
and there is also other people,
like Yasmin,
you know, maybe doing a little bit less work.
Yasmin, you are already rolling your eyes.
I wasn't rolling my eyes,
but if you want my opinion, I'll be happy to give it.
Sure.
Well, I find that a bit of a surprise.
As a matter of fact, anything somebody had asked me to do, I did it.
So I don't see how he figured I could be doing more.
I felt like that's a conversation him and I could have beforehand
and I would have stepped it up,
because I have not shied away from any work.
And maybe I don't belong in the jungle because I have on heels,
but I wanted to dress up for you, Jeff
So I thought, you know, I would look a little nicer or whatever.
Mission accomplished.
Thank you.
Let's talk about challenges.
Russell, how important are challenges in this game right now?
For me, challenges are your base.
If the base isn't there, everything topples.
So, get the challenges done, 
the rest falls into place.
Yasmin, you're shaking your head in agreement.
I'm very competitive at heart.
I just always like to step up because damn, I like to compete.
So I totally agree with Russell. 101%.
So, based on what you said, 
who could've given more in thoday's challenge?
Today, Monica struggled.
That's just the way that I see it.
Monica, what would you do when you hear your name
as somebody who might have blown the challenge 
that put you here?
It sucks. I mean, especially for me,
I think I did a great job at the challenge today.
I mean, getting on the rope originally I tried to get my bearing.
But once I got past that, I think I really came back to my normal self.
So Dave, you can go camp-wise,
you can go challenges, or you can go individual strategy,
the problem with that is if you start making big moves too soon,
you will destroy your tribe,
and it's only a matter of time before you are gone.
I think, ultimately,
what's good for the tribe, is good for me.
And so, that's what I'm basing my vote on.
Laura, do you agree with that?
Number one for me is who's helping around the camp the most.
Alright, it sounds like there are a couple of philosophies
about how the vote should go tonight.
Let's see which one wins out.
It's time to vote.
Erik, you are up.
I don't feel like you had carried out your duty around camp,
despite what you said.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the decision is final.
Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote:
Yasmin.
Yasmin. Two votes Yasmin.
Monica. Two votes Yasmin, one vote Monica.
Monica. Two votes Monica.
Yas.
That's three votes Yasmin, two votes Monica.
Yasmin. That's four votes Yasmin, two votes Monica.
That's five votes Yasmin, two votes Monica.
Fourth person voted out of "Survivor: Samoa":
Yasmin. Six votes, that's enough. Bring me your torch.
Yasmin, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Well, not only did you lose a tribe member,
you guys lost momentum.
Question is can you get it back?
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.
Good night.
Next time on "Survivor":
Maybe the worst thing out here.
These black clouds scare me. 
I have never in my life been this cold. 
All of our blankets are wet. There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.
You're lying to me.
Let me tell you, you're walking on thin ice.
Liz struggling to hang on.
I personally feel like I'm such a strong competitor that,
had I made it to the end,
it would have been really hard not to vote for me.
These people are going to start to scramble
because they're not being true to themselves.
They tip-toe around each other.
They're full of crap. It's just crazy.
But, you know what?
If that's the type of company I've to keep,
I'm happy to be going.
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
