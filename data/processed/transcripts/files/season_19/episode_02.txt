        Previously on "Survivor"
These 20 casts away were marooned
on the tiny island nation of Samoa.
You have already been divided you have
already been divided into two tribes.
Wearing purple you're Galu.
Wearing yellow you're Foa Foa.
At their camp, Galu had a had
a communications breakdown.
We have strong male personalities
That aren't really hearing one another.
Oh my God, these guys are killing me .
But Galu's problems were
minor compared to Foa Foa's.
Their tribe's biggest problem is spelled








R-U-S-S-E-L-L.
They can be my little puppets.
When I'm finished with them
I'll throw them in the trash.
On their first night he sabotaged their own
camp to make live miserable for the others.
I think if I can control how they
feel I can control how they think.
He made a secret series of alliances.
I got alliance with the dumb-short hair blonde,
and even dumber long-hair blonde.
The dark-Hard girl, I like to call
her my dumb-Ass girl alliance.
He constantly lied.
I lived in New Orleans.
The storm was a category 5.
When it hit I tried to get out of the house,
and I realized I was never going to make it.
I never lived in New Orleans.
It's crazy how you can break it's crazy how
you can break their heart by telling a lie.








After Foa Foa lost the immunity challenge, Russell
need a fall guy ,so when Marisa became suspicious of him
He found his sacrificial lamb.
What is that going to make me think?
That makes me think we
have to get rid of her.
Vote Marisa.
Vote Marisa.
Not everybody was on
board with his scheme.
Marisa.
No,.
She's going first.
If you stay with me you're
going to be fine for a long time.
Unfortunately for
Russell, Betsy?s cop and
She didn't believe a word he said.
As a police officer I can usually
get a pretty good read on somebody
And I don't trust Russell.
At tribal council, Betsy
wasn't against Russell
And targeted Ashley as weakest player.
I think Ashley's the weakest.
But Russell's sway over
the others was too strong.
First person voted out of
"Survivor: Samoa," Marisa.
Marisa was out,
Leaving officer Betsy to
return to camp to figure out
Where Russell will strike next.
19 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
Foa Foa day 4
Tribal council
was-- I liked it.
I had fun because Marisa's
gone no other reason but me,
And that's a fact.
If you play with fire, you gonna get burned,
And she get burned
I'm excited that Marisa is gone
You know I don't have to
worry about it no more.
I don't have to worry
about her strong mind.
I Know she's a strong woman.
You can't have that out here.
I can't have it.
You ever gonna talk to me again ?
You see, the thing
is, I-- I was telling you
I didn't do anything for
you not to trust me nothing.
You was going by
appearance only I guess.
Or how I was trying to
play the game so fast.
Which I understand.
But I-- I meant it and
I even told the people
I was with that I want to keep you
around as long as I possibly can.
I think you made a huge mistake, and
you'll see that later on.
Okay.
Because I was...
---All right,
As long as we agree that we don't
trust each other but we still can talk.
Yeah.
---All right
I just don't--
You don't--
Why didn't you trust
me from the beginning?
You're not a threat to me.
It would be a perfect
thing for me to do.
But, anyway.
Okay.
It is what it is.
----It is what it is.
I feel fine that I voted for
Ashley last night I have no regrets.
But I think Russ felt
very threatened by Marisa.
He didn't like her.
She spoke her mind,
But I'm not afraid to stand up to him at all.
He knows where I'm coming from.
He knows that I have no
faith in him, and I used to.
But not after getting to know him.

Taking Candy From A Baby
Galu day 4
Look at all the rashes.
They ate me up.
See you, even still look nice.
What's wrong with me?
Why do I look this bad?
Because you're funky, baby?
Whatever.
Funky is the word.
Oh,my god.
I'm never taking my kids camping.
This is crap.
I don't know who invented
liking the outdoors.
Who can like the outdoors
when you can be indoors.
This is not for me.
Look how I have to
walk, like?s stick up my butt.
Last night was horrible.
Lord oh,mercy God I didn't know it was
going to be this hard.
I was shaking, I was
cold, I was nauseated.
I don't know what was happening.
All I know is it was not good.
Look at that bed.
That bed is pitiful.
I've been told so many times,oh,if you
can make it in, you can make it anywhere.
What the hood.
The hood is not the wood.
Eehh!
Foa Foa
Yeah, I got a lizard!
Stick a stick down his
face and roast him up.
All right, I just want to
make sure everything is good.
Last night was a little
too chaotic for me.
I was a little shocked
By how aggressive you guys
were with in Marisa last night.
I didn't know the hatred ran that deep.
That ain't it.
It is nothing to do with hatred.
It's just she was-- I
thought it's just she was--
I thought she would be
a real powerful player.
What do you think about Ben though ?
I trust you way more than Ben.
Do you?
I think Jaison is somebody
perfect to bring with you
Because he's so calm and collective.
He's an honest guy.
He's playing the game, playing
the challenges hard.
He's quiet, but he's likeable.
You can't do this alone.
You gotta have somebody.
So if Jaison is the
person that I can trust,
Then this is going to be real good.
Another thing, man
I think there's immunity idol in our camp.
You gotta keep that a secret.
And I should keep it a secret
But the reason I'm telling
you is because I trust you
And I'm going to start looking for it.
Because if we can find
that without any clues.
That would be wonderful.
Russell really wants to find
this hidden immunity idol.
We don't even know if
there is we don't even know
If there is an immunity
idol that's hidden
Or going to come into
existence or whatever.
So he's kind of, I guess
Trying to launch a preemptive
strike on trying to figure out
Where that thing would be.
If I can find that idol, then
that would be genius.
In the history of "Survivor,"
How many people found
the idol without a clue?
Zero.
I think you'll like this, Mick.
Pretty tasty.
It's white meat.
I cannot believe I'm eating lizard.
Oh,my God.
It kind of tastes like chicken fish.
What's he doing in there?
I'm looking.
I'm looking for the immunity idol.
These people are so ignorant.
Everybody is standing in the same spot.
I'm in a big old hole in the tree
And I don't want to look
suspicious but it surely does.
So I look in the tree, I look up.
I almost passed out.
I seen it sitting there.
So I reached up there and
yanked it down, got it loose,
Put it in my underwear,
turned around and just walked off.
The wonderful immunity idol.
Boo-Gah.
Ow!
Is that it?
When I looked up,
I almost passed out.
When I looked up and
seen it, I started shaking.
Keep it cool.
And then everybody's
standing right there?
I know.
How did you get it, put if in your pants?
Russell found the idol
so I'm excited we have it.
I think its definitely tool that we can use,
so, this is yours.
It can't be taken from you.
I'm not sure how I feel that
That he has control
of it as opposed to me
But at this point I think I
can trust Russell a lot more.
You and I have a deal.
Hell,yeah,man,it's on.
I wouldn't have told you
if it wouldn't have been.
I ain't stupid.
It's on.
Let me get back before..
My strategy from the beginning was
If I found the immunity
idol I wouldn't tell anybody,
But I wanted Jaison to trust me,
So I showed him I had
it and I said, you see
You can trust me.
I don't have plans to give it to him.
I just want him to think
that I will if he needs it.
How does it look on me?
Foa Foa day 5
Let's go get tree mail.
Come on.
---Me and you?
Yes.
Okay,Mike,don't doubt yourself.
We can do this, right?
We're not going to give up.
We got to.
Betsy's paranoid.
We're the two older ones
But at tribal council
I didn't get one vote
But I want to show them today that,
You know, I?m not the weakest.
I'm the oldest but I am
definitely not the weakest.
We have to win challenges.
Right.
Between Betsy and
Mike, whoever performs. ---Right.
Less, they?re out.
Right it's easy.
Next two are easy.
Easy,yup.
The debate about voting people
out is between Mike and Betsy
And the more I thought Betsy, and
the more I thought about it,
I more I thought it would be smarter to vote
Mike off.
He can't compete physically,
And God forbid, if we
lose the next immunity,
Mike's going to go.
Mailman.
Take it boss.
Let's see what we've got here.
All the bravado and talk
smack may cost someone today.
A rumble and a test of skill
will send one more away.
Physical. Rumble!
Who's the boss, who?s the boss?
Come to the challenge
participated as a Samoan warrior.
Nice.
Who can draw?
I can draw.
Mike's been dying for
this since day one.
This is the one I have to
prove myself, show my stuff.
I'm a mean motor scooter and bad go-Getter, man,
when it comes to one-On-One stuff.
You're from New York, I know.
Someone's getting hurt
and it ain't our team.
I'm going to take them
downtown to Chinatown.
I'm waiting for this.
Or I'll die trying.
Come on in, guys!
Galu,getting your first look
at the new Foa Foa tribe.
Marisa voted out at
the last tribal council.
All right, you guys ready
to get to today's challenge?
Yes.
First things first.
John, I'll take back the immunity idol.
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.
On my "go,"
Tribe will battle to each tribe
will battle to retrieve three balls.
You'll pass those balls to three
other tribe mates up on a platform
Who will attempt to shoot those balls into
the shoot those balls opposing tribe's basket.
After every point we
will switch positions.
First tribe to score three points wins
immunity and reward and it's a nice one.
Fishing gear.
If you cannot catch
fish with this, go home.
In addition,
One other twist which will be
revealed after the challenge.
Make sense?
Galu you have one extra member.
You're sitting somebody out,
Cannot sit out the same person
in back-To-Back challenges.
In this challenge, you
must sit out a woman.
Monica's going to sit this one out.
Everybody else, give you a minute
to strategize and we'll get started.
All right, first round.
In the pit we have the men.
Up on the platform, the
women are the shooters.
Survivors ready?
Go!
A big collision right off the bat.
You've got to get the ball
to the people on the platform
So they can take a shot at the goal.
Ball control is everything in this game.
Throw it all the way!
Shambo shoot and misses.
Russell getting in
on it, goes after Erik.
Russell has Brett tied up.
This is going to be physical.
A lot on the line this challenge.
Russell going after Erik again.
Laura goes underhand.
It's short, and Russell tied up.
Erik collides with Mick.
Liz shoot for Foa Foa and scores.
Men you're out, women you're down.
Next threesome you're
up on the platform.
Foa Foa leads one-Zip.
Playing to three.
Survivors ready?
Go.
It's the women in the middle.
Lauren and Natalie
going at it right away.
John is short.
Natalie and Laura with
a heavy match going.
Watch the choking.
No choking.
Russell with a shot for Galu.
Shambo.
Easy on the face.
John with a shot.
John shoot and scores for Galu.
We are tied 1-1.
It's all right.
I know it's hard.
All right, everybody listen up.
I'm just going to tell
what I'm observing.
You're right on that line of
getting ugly, right on the line.
So there's no more
warnings for a head butt,
An accidental choke a slap to the face.
Consider yourself warned
That from this point
Forward if see anything
resembling a cheap shot
You're out of the challenge.
Everybody good?
All right, we have our next round.
Three men are on the platform,
Two men, one woman in the pit.
Survivors ready?
Go.
Yasmin annihilating Ashley.
Russell and Jaison going at it.
Erik with a shot.
Just misses.
Ben takes down John.
Russell and Jaison mix it up.
Everybody's tied up.
A big battle on the ground.
Ben, stop!
Ben, out of the challenge!
First time in the history of Survivor somebody's
been pulled out of a challenge.
Take a spot here. You?re done.
You already, Russ?
Starting this point over, Foa
Foa is now down one person.
That means here in the
pit, Galu has a huge advantage.
Two guys and a girl taking
on one guy and a girl.
We are still tied 1-1.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Galu has all three balls.
Big opportunity.
Jaison cannot get away from Russell.
Jaison takes down John.
Eric with an underhand.
Erik scores for Galu.
Galu leads 2-1.
Next round.
Ben,--
you're in the pit.
Woman up on the platform.
Foa Foa has to score to
stay in this challenge.
Galu scores, they win.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Oh, Dave and Russell
collide in the middle.
Liz shoot and misses.
Big bodies colliding.
Erik finally gets some
payback on boeracy.
Mike!
Scores for Galu.
3-1,Galu wins reward.
And immunity
Ben how you feeling about being
the first person in the history
Of this game to ever be
thrown out of a challenge?
Outlaw, baby.
Whatever.
No use crying over spilled milk.
I'm out.
I'm just going to let it go.
All right,Galu,back-To-Back
immunity wins.
Galu, safe from tribal council.
Huge reward of fishing gear,
Plus one twist--
This involves
Russell, come on over.
All right, as leader,
You must now select one person
From your tribe to accompany
other tribe back to camp.
They will return back to your camp after sitting in and
camp after sitting in and observing at tribal council.
Who you going to send?
I'm going to send my home girl, Yasmin.
Yasmin, this is for you
Open in private once you
get to Foa Foa's camp.
Join Foa Foa.
After this challenge, this
should be interesting.
Galu, grab your fishing
gear, head on back to camp.
All right, Foa Foa.
I will see you once
again at tribal council.
And Borassi,I want medical
to take a look at you.
During the challenge Mike
took some really hard hits.
He was very out of breath.
He just did not seem right to me.
And that's huge, especially right now.
If we continue losing,
We're going to dwindle to nothing
And then we're just going
to get kicked out one by one.
Foafoa day 5
Survivor medical team
-What's his blood pressure now?
-92 and 60.
You want to stand up for me?
How do you feel standing up?
-A little woozy.
-A little woozy?
Cameron's there if you need to sit down.
Just keep that on.
When we were done with the challenge, Mike
was having challenge breathing,
I'm going to get you
to do a complete breath.
When medical checked him out, he was
suffering from very, very low blood pressure.
I'm going to look at
your blood pressure again.
As a physician myself,
especially out here,
You have to consider the worst-Case
scenario, you know
Which for him is probably
a big heart attack.
Let's have a tiny sit-Up.
If you start feeling woozy at all,
I want you to lie right back down.
I can do it on my own.
All right. We're going to take it again.
80 on 60. So he's dropped 30 just standing.
Is this something that a couple of
canteen as water back at camp will remedy?
We've already tried his canteen
and waited for the 40 min
The fact he was blue when he
came off the game is a bit scary.
It shows us his heart
is not coping very well.
So,doc,just so we're clear, you are
pulling Barossi from the game?
Foa Foa, come say your
good-Byes to Mike.
I wanted to go all the way, you know.
I'm a little beat up, but those
guys never got me down in the pit.
Your health is worth more
than a million bucks, my friend.
I think I showed that I can be tough when I
have to be, no matter what age I am, you know.
All right,so,here's what this means?
Foa Foa is now down to eight members.
You guys are going to head
back to camp with Yasmin.
You're still visiting. You will still
go to tribal council tomorrow night.
You guys head back to camp.
Borassi you're going to the hospital.
I was prif to the conversation
that Mike had with the physician.
And I think she absolutely
made the right decision.
With Mike gone, Marisa
gone, and then tribal council.
You know, I'd like to say we can push through
this, but it does not look well for us.
Did Shambo take the fins?
Where is she?
I would love her to come back
with fish. She is way down there.
Shambo insisted spear fishing was her thing.
Awesome, she?s bringing back fish for sure.
In my belly ?
Shambo has been gone a while
I hope it means she got some fish.
This is the first bath I've had in five
days, even. If it is a swamp. It feels awesome.
I didn't catch any fish, but I tried. And
there's no visibility in this pond water,
So I can't use the mask and the spear.
So I'm going to go yogi Berra back float
around here for a little while.
Hey,how did it go?
You guys want the good
news or the bad news.
Bad news.
I had no luck in the ocean.
-I was in the--
-You broke the--
I didn't break it. It floated off while I
was in the swamp. I wasn't using the mouthpiece.
I was using the mask. And floated off.
So the mouthpiece is gone?
It is.
You couldn't find it?
It's in the swamp.
There's nothing I can do.
And the good news?
There are hundreds of thousand
of fish on the reef so-- So--
The good news is, you?ll never
believe it-There's fish in the ocean.
You know, I feel sorry for in one sense
Because she's kind of desperate
right now trying to catch fish,
And then on top of not cashing
the fish, she loses our stuff.
You just sign your own death
warrant is basically what you did.
I mean, if everybody come closer
I would like to introduce myself
Tell you guys who I am and find
out a little bit about you.
Okay,now,my name is Yasmin and
I'm a professional hair stylist.
I don't know how you're feeling about
me but let's just say I'm not the enemy.
Not only, that I'm here to help you guys
strategize because to me I don't like a not-Fair
It's almost like why be matched up with people
that's not matched up with the right people
Because then it's like
take candy from a baby.
Who the hell wants to do that?
That doesn't boost my self-Esteem.
You know what I mean? That makes it seem
like I did something that was a cake walk.
We got Yasmin mean here. And
what are her first words to us?
"I want to help you guys? Why?
I don't want this to be a cake walk. I don't
want this to be like taking candy from a baby.
" I was like, screw you.
Don't get offended, but personally, I?ve noticed that
strategy may be something you guys are lacking.
And I don't know his
name-- What's his name?
Ben . I would like to talk to
you Ben in private. For sure.
I know it's not a game where people think
you can be people think you can be honest.
She's full of crap.
She comes over here to our camp,
disrespects us, calls us babies,
Tells us how we can win a
challenge if we listen to her.
She come to the wrong camp
because she ain't getting nothing
But disrespect from me for
now on and you know what?
She's going to pay for that
statement. I promise you.
Congratulations.
You now have a clue to
the hidden immunity idol.
It's up to you whether you share
this information with anyone else.
Search hard here at Foa Foa.
Your treasure's not easy to see.
If you don't find it in a little while, you
must be barking up the wrong tree.
I haven't been here all of two hours
yet, so I don't know who I could trust.
I do care about getting that idol, but with
that clue and I had to go on was a tree.
You know how many trees are
out here? Too many, so you know.
Can we have a talk for a second.
Please?
Sure.
-What's up?
-Let's talk about cheap shots.
- I don't
know--
A cheap shot?
Guess what.
You tackle me like a dude.
Don't tell me you don't remember.
Well, that?s just the
way the game's played.
It wasn't anything personal upon you
were going after one of my teammates.
But you're a dude. Look at the match-Up.
Do you see women playing football.
Because they cannot.
They don't for a reason. So I want to know
why would a dude as tall as you tackle me?
Because you were going
after my teammate.
That was very disrespectful.
I understand what you're saying
but you're not showing me no sympathy
And you're not understanding
what I'm saying.
You're a dude, it doesn't
you're a dude, it doesn't matter.
Listen, grammar school.
Here's here's
where it's going--
Ignorant.
Since you want to say grammar school.
What's the definition of ignorant.
What's the definition of grammar school.
I want to let you know because
I don't back down to nobody
And I don't appreciate you tackling me.
Yasmin is a piece of work. Yasmin
has a big mouth. Yasmin smells bad.
She has poor grammar.
I think Yasmin is pretty
close to being a hooker.
You're the one that looks like a fool.
If they saw you they wouldn't say
he tackled a girl. He's a big bomb.
They would say he's a big
sissy. You heard what I said.
Yeah I heard your incorrect
grammar the whole time.
She's barking up the wrong tree because I'm
one person you don't want to approach like that.
You don't know the
definition of ignorant.
You don't even know the you don't
even know the definition of ignorant.
Who would tackle a girl who weight 110?
You were going after our
teammate. Just shut up.
Ben is definitely a wild
card. He's definitely a liability.
He's saying things at challenges.
He's getting kicked out of challenges.
Honestly, I think what Ben is
doing is stupid on his part.
She needs to go back to eating ketchup
sandwiches and drinking cool-Aid
And doing whatever the hell
else she does and leave me alone.
You know what? I wish Yasmin
was here for another three days
Because I love confrontation.
Her and Ben start fighting.
Everybody starts hearing it.
I love that. That just
makes everybody not like Ben.
You know, I got some
great plans set ahead.
And this is going to be real fun.
My god
It's like a joke. He?s
pounding over there.
You know?
It's so ridiculous.
You were about to say
Natalie
What?
When everyone's sleeping. I think
we need to figure out a respectful.
Like.
Thing about when everyone is sleeping
No?
Good luck
Um,I don't know what's going
on, but Ben was up all night.
I think he's asking to be thrown out.
It was so ridiculous.
It was so crazy.
Why would you hammer a machete
in the middle of the night?
With a fire going. There's no reason.
So I don't think anybody's too happy.
I was getting really
annoyed by that guy. He really drives me crazy.
You know how he gets, man?
Anybody calls him out or anything or he
gets exasperated he really just unleashes,
Instead of being like we
need to talk about this.
You know, all that outlaw
stuff to me is just a facade
I don't think he's as big
a badass as he thinks he is
I don't think so either.
Cause man, like Ben just doesn't seem to
be helping in the challenges very much
Who the hell hammers in
the middle of the night?
At nothing.
I don't get him.
Now that Mike's gone, my head is
definitely on the chopping block.
Because I know they're all looking at
me as being the elder and the weakest.
But I don't want to go home at all.
Ben needs to go, in my opinion.
I know that you're saying,"oh, we need
him for strength or to win challenges,
But we haven't won any challenges, and
plus he got kicked out of a challenge.
I would have voted for him even
if it didn't happen last night.
I was going to vote for him anyway. I was
going to tell you I was voting for him.
Tonight I think Betsy is going
home. We need to focus on challenges
And she is considered to be the weakest link
right now weakest link right now physically.
But Ben getting kicked out of the challenge, him waking
up and chopping wood, his big altercation with Yasmin,
I mean, those are three big strikes.
So I don't know if he's
got a lot of friends left.
Go with your gut. Go
way woman's intuition.
It's strong, though.
Listen to your intuition.
Go with a police woman, motherly
type or an outlaw?
I don't know. There's a lot at stake.
An outlaw who is a pain in the ass!
I think if anybody else got
kicked out of a challenge,
Has never happened before, they would
be getting voted off at tribal council.
Why isn't it not Ben?
I don't know.
I won't write your names down.
Maybe Ben would be the right choice to
kick out tonight. He's not a nice guy.
And he is, you know, kind
of pissing people off.
I did originally think, you know, I
was stuck on voting out Betsy,
But now that I think about it more and
more, I don't that's the right choice.
I just don't know if we're
making the right choice.
Well, this is my thing.
We made a big sacrifice with Marisa, and
we kept the physical weakness and he lost.
And we got a loss because he got
kicked out of the challenge yesterday.
Absolutely.
And he's pissing off a lot of
people around our own camp.
Yeah,he might be physically a
little better. Betsy is a cop--
She's slow.
There are some good points
to voting off Ben eventually.
But betty is a 47-Year-Old cop
and Ben is a 28-Year-Old young guy.
They are not physically equivalent which
is the argument Ashley was trying to make.
I can't
- I don't know what to do with this girl.
What is she so concerned about?
She's trying to switch up the she's
trying to switch up the whole thing.
She's getting worried.
-Why
-I don't know.
Betsy has to go or we
will get our asses kicked.
It's over. She's going for sure.
You and I know that.
Jaison.
You know what? She better stop that.
Betsy's going home tonight because, first
of all, she?s the weakest link.
And second of all, she doesn't trust me.
Marisa threatened me, Betsy threatened
me. I'm going to go down the line.
Each time somebody threatens me, they're
going to home Ashley, she'll be going home next.
I want to keep Ben this time.
And you know what? Ben's
going te and you know what?
Ben's going te because
whatever I want happens.
Come on in and at a take a seat.Yasmin,you
can have a seat right over here.
All right, last time you were here,
The discussion really centered around a
negative force that you identified as Marisa.
You voted her out.
Liz,one,big happy family now?
I think so for the most part.
It doesn't help that we lost yet
another challenge that never bodes well,
But I think going forward,yeah,we
are pretty forward,
So if it's one big happy family,Yasmin's
visit must have been fairly pleasant?
There was one minor
incident with Yasmin and Ben,
But I think for the most part, her
stay was fairly congenial.
Ben,what happened with Yasmin?
When Yasmin showed up, she
said, ?let?s talk about cheap
She said, ?you tackled me and I'm a
girlment mp I said there wasn't any rule
That a guy can't pub a girl down.
And she said you're a
sissy and went on and on
Her grammar is so poor it
was like talking to an idiot.
She's ghetto trash and I have no respect for
her, and she needs to go back to where she came from.
Russell you're biting your
tongue to get in on this.
I have to say, when she came to our house
she said, ?it?s like taking candy from a baby.
If somebody came to your house
and disrespected your family,
Are you going to turn the other cheek and go
in the other room kick them out of your house
Well, I think we can sit here and talk about
kicking somebody but we've got to win a challenge.
Yeah,I was upset she said
taking candy from a baby.
I don't want to get punched in the face
and left in the mud be told I'm a baby, no.
But you don't prove it by but you
don't prove it by yelling at somebody.
You prove it by beating
the other team, period.
Mick, you?re the leader. Are you okay
with how Ben handles defending your tribe.
That's how pen rolls. The
guy doesn't just show teeth.
I mean, he bites
Can that be disruptive to a tribe?
I think it sort of intimidates people a little
bit, but you know what you're going to get from him
So if you don't want
that, then don't go there.
I'd just like to say
something about Ben.
Betsy.
With him helping us lose the
challenge, him challenge, him mouthing off,
Him chopping wood in the middle
of the night driving us crazy
He would probably be
the person voted out
And I don't understand because
I'm the one who brought my bag.
**********
"Did you see that speeder? "
He was going faster than I was.
He slides by the rules.*****
***********
Ashley, you think it hurt you
guys yesterday losing Ben?
So it did hurt us in the end,
which is disappointing, but.
Ben, any regret at all about
what happened at the challenge?
First of all, you never said we were
playing by your kind of sissy rules.
I mean, I regret that I didn't I mean get to
help my teammates,bumt do I regret tripping him?
Absolutely not. Everybody else is doing all this
really crazy stuff, and all I did was trip somebody.
Accidental trip or on purpose?
Completely on purpose. I was, like
this guy's big. I can't tackle him.
But guess what. My legs are longer
than him, whack. Big tree falls hard.
That's basically what happened.
Ben, let?s say this game started you had 100% chance
of winning. Where do you think it's at all now.
I as good a chance as anybody
You believe based on how you've acted your chances
of winning are as good as anybody else's in the game?
I definitely do. You know what, I?m
straight forward with a people.
I'm not the type of
person that starts a fight
But if you come starts a fight
at me, you?re going to get a fight.
It is time to get to the vote.
That means,Yasmin,your
time here is done.
You've had a chance to observe a lot.
What you choose to share and what you
choose to keep to yourself is up to you.
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
All right, it is time
to vote. Mick, you?re up.
Bad boy, bad boy, watch you gonna do?
What you gonna do when they come for you?
Don't use my name if you
get stopped in new Hampshire.
I thought you were a good cop but
you're a bad cop. So this one's for you.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read
the decision is final.
The person voted out will be asked to
leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Betsy.
Ben. One vote Betsy, one vote Ben.
Betsy. Two votes Betsy, one vote Ben.
Betsy. That's three
votes Betsy, one vote Ben.
Betsy. That's four
votes Betsy, one vote Ben.
Second person voted out of
"Survivor: Samoa," Betsy.
That's five, that?s enough. You
need to bring me your torch.
Betsy, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Well, it?s clear from tonight's tribal
council that you are voting together.
The question is are you working
Six days in, down three members.
Something not working right.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
Good night.
Survivor S19E02
Taking Candy From A Baby
Next time on "Survivor": Russell's mind games
"Survivor": Russell's mind games continue.
You plant that seed in their head
and it's called a "Russell head
It takes over their whole mind.
Jaison recruits an army to fight him.
I'm definitely loyal to Jaison.
And Shambo is on the outs.
Are you freaking kidding me?
We've got four people doing
we've got four people doing yoga.
Well, it took me six years to get here.
I loved every minute of it.
The only thing I'm not going
to miss is Ben and his attitude.
He needs to grow up.
He's still not admitting he did he's still not
admitting he did something wrong at the challenge.
It's all going to blow up in it's
all going to blow up in their face.
They made the wrong choice
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
