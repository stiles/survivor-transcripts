         JEFF PROBST: By the end of
tonight, one of these five will
win the title of sole survivor
and the million dollars that
comes with it.
There's only one thing standing
in the way of the Foa Foa
foursome making it all the way
to the final four, and his name
is Brett.
But out of all the castaways








that started this journey, how
did it come down to these five?
Russell had a strategy from the
very beginning.
 I think if I can control how
they feel, I can control how
they think.
 PROBST: Because of Russell,
the Foa Foa tribe turned on
each other.
 Somebody drank my whole
canteen.
 There's no more water.
 We gotta fill the canteens.








 Would you just relax?
 Use a little common sense.
 PROBST: The turmoil allowed
Russell to manipulate his
tribe...
 She's going first.
 PROBST: ...and take out
anyone he wanted.
 They my little puppets.
When I'm finished with them, I
just throw them in the trash.
 PROBST: Galu wins immunity!
But it also might have
contributed to Foa Foa's
spectacular failure
at challenges; they lost
almost every one.
 We do have a pox or a hex or
some kind of curse on Foa Foa.
 PROBST: But as their numbers
rapidly dwindled, a tight-knit
group of four emerged.
Natalie, the quote, unquote
nice girl.
Most people didn't think she
would last a day, let alone a
a month.
 She came into this game the
Southern belle.
I think she's changed a lot.
 PROBST: Jaison, the social
conscience of the tribe, a
Fulbright scholar who stands up
for what he believes in.
 If what you're telling me is
that what you said had
absolutely no racial context,
then maybe you are ignorant.
 PROBST: Mick, who was
initially selected as tribe
leader but couldn't rally them
to victory.
Mick with a great shot.
Mick is the new mark to beat.
However, lately he has proved
that he can win individual
challenges.
Mick safe at tonight's Tribal
Council.
This diverse group has one
thing in common; they all take
their cues from Russell.
 He is the most powerful
player in this game.
(thunder crashing)
 PROBST: While the Foa Foa
tribe struggled,
the Galu tribe...
 Whoo!
 PROBST: sat back and laughed.
(all laughing)
 They are in trouble.
After I'm finish this,
I'll take the whole team
by myself.
 Russell get off the table.
 PROBST: But when they lost
their charismatic leader...
Medical!
to a medical emergency...
 Lie him down.
 PROBST: ...they lost the glue
that held them together.
Unfortunately for them, they
didn't realize it.
Galu entered the merge with a
staggering 8-to-4 advantage...
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: ...confident they
would devour the opposition.
 Unless something goes wrong,
Foa Foa doesn't matter,
simple as that.
 PROBST: But Natalie shocked
everyone by making the first
counterattack.
 (whispers) I don't
trust Erik.
 PROBST: She convinced the
old Galu to take out one of
their strongest players.
Time for you to go.
Then it was Russell's turn to
make a move.
He scoured the camp and found a
hidden immunity idol...
 That easy.
 PROBST: ...and played it to
take out another Galu.
Kelly, the tribe has spoken.
He also turned a disgruntled
Shambo against her tribe...
 I trust Russell implicitly
more than anybody in this game.
 PROBST: ...which provided the
old Foa Foa with the numbers to
take out four more of the old
Galu in a row.
 Stupid, stupid little girl.
Bad strategy.
 PROBST: By day 35, the Foa
Foa turnaround was
almost complete.
 It is done.
They say don't get confident in
this game.
You know what?
I'm confident as hell.
 PROBST: But while Russell was
congratulating himself on his
clean sweep of the old Galu,
Brett, who had been virtually
unheard of during the entire
game, came out of nowhere to
win challenges...
Brett wins individual immunity!
...and keep the memory of Galu's
past glories alive.
Once again, Brett is safe at
Tribal Council, guaranteed a
spot in the final five.
 I worked too damn hard for
some kid to come here and start
working, and day 33-- you
know, what strategy did he do
that worked for him?
Absolutely nothing.
 PROBST: In order to beat
Brett, the Foa Foa four decided
they needed the youngest and
strongest players to stay in
the game, so they were forced
to vote off Shambo.
With Brett's former tribe making
up the entire jury and Russell
looming as a threat to his own
allies, the real battle
starts now.

 We have tree mail.
Already.
 We don't have to get up.
 I'll read to y'all in bed.
"37 days you've survived this
"game, a victory guarantees
"one more.
"Use balance, speed and
"patience to fight to the
final four."
 Uh-oh.
I have so little energy and
diarrhea all night.
I was, like, "Just don't let me
get killed."
 Everybody here is sleeping,
napping, complaining and
bitching, you know, I came
here focused.
I came here knowing I was going
to suffer.
But you know what? Get over it.
Get up and do something.
Get ready for this challenge.
We have to get rid of Brett.
It's a shame that I'm set up
with these bunch of misfits
because I should be here
with superstars.
 I'm just ready to get out of
here more than anything else.
My stomach hurts.
Just try to get through two
days and go home.
 Two more nights, man,
that's it.
 Yeah.
 Two more nights here.
 As far as I'm concerned,
everything's cool.
So I'm not second-guessing what
we got going on.
If you know what I mean.
 Yeah.
I think Russell will have a hard
time voting her off.
 I think Russell will have an
easier time doing a lot of
things than you think.
None of us really have a chance
as long as Brett's here, so we
got to keep going after him.
 Hopefully, one of us will
pull this thing off.
 I agree.
Brett shouldn't be here
right now.
You know, this guy has got
some skills.
I think he can make a run.
And now this guy is going on an
immunity run like we've
never seen.
(thunder rumbling)
 Look what's happening now.
 I was worried.
 You know what's gonna
happen if he wins the next one?
I ain't gonna be there
to save you.
How?
 But how would I be next,
though?
Why would I be next?
 Because the three guys state
to beat him on the last
challenge.
 Okay.
So we got to just...
 Well, that sucks.
 Well, we just got to win.
He's not some freakin' athlete
genius.
 Well, I would love to go to
the final three and...
 Yeah, I know.
We just have...
I don't know what's gonna
happen.
We could possibly beat him, and
then it's back to the
normal plan.
 If not, though, you think
I'm going?
 Probably so.
 You know, my whole goal
coming into this game was to
play the underdog, be
underestimated and just kind of
slide through, which is what
I've done, and it's gotten me
this far.
 We all know what has
to happen.
Sometimes you got to go for it.
That's what I'm gonna do.
 You know, Russell and I had
always planned to be in the
top, but unfortunately, they
want to beat Brett so bad at
the next immunity challenge
that, you know, there's
honestly, probably no way that I
could beat Brett.
 We just got to win this one.
 Yeah.
 If we don't beat him, we
don't have a shot.
I'm talking about, you know,
the dog in the corner.
It looks like we've got four of
them in the corner now.
You know, Brett's won two
individual immunities.
He could possibly win the last
two, but what's two immunities?
If Jaison could win two in a
row, anybody can win two
in a row.
That means absolutely nothing
to me.
Let's see if a 21-year-old can
outdo me when it comes to pain.
So you're telling me he's all
of a sudden superman 'cause he
wins two?
He, he's not some superstar
to me.
You start thinking that, you
start getting weak in the mind,
thinking you can't beat him,
like you're stepping into the
ring with Mike Tyson.
He's no Mike Tyson.
He's Brett.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Final five:
Natalie, Russell, Brett,
wearing immunity...
Mick and Jaison.
Russell, as we go into this
challenge, is it still the Foa
Foa four against the one
remaining guy in purple?
 Yes, it is.
That's what it is.
 PROBST: Brett, does that
energize you or make you feel
like you've got to watch your
back everywhere?
 This is an individual
competition, so it's definitely
a motivator to know that I have
four people with the sole goal
of just beating me, so, yeah,
it's definitely a motivator
for me.
 PROBST: Well, you've had it
two times in a row around
your neck.
Let's see if you can do it a
third time.
I will take it back, Brett...
...because once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you will
race across a series of
obstacles, grab a bag of puzzle
pieces, and race back.
You must then climb a very
steep wall to a platform and
use those pieces to solve
a puzzle.
First person to get it right
wins immunity and is guaranteed
a one-in-four shot at winning a
million bucks.
We know what's up; four Foa
Foa taking on one former Galu.
Shall we get to it?
 Yes.
 Let's do it.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.
Here we go for immunity and a
guaranteed spot in the final
four.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Jaison takes a hard fall in the
net run.
Mick falls off.
Got to get back up on.
Natalie's across.
Jaison is across.
Brett is across.
And Mick is across.
Russell heading back.
Jaison's heading back.
Everybody heading back.
Russell cruising across the
balance beam.
Russell scales that wall.
Jaison right behind.
Brett's still in it.
Everybody climbing up the wall.
Everybody is in this challenge.
Russell has his pieces open
first.
Mick right behind.
Brett now has his pieces untied.
Five people vying for a shot at
the final four.
That much closer to a million
bucks.
The stakes are very clear for
Brett.
He has four people working to
beat him.
Brett making quick work of his
puzzle.
Mick now getting in on it.
His puzzle starting to come
together.
Russell starting to come
together.
Natalie starting to come
together.
Everybody needs to keep moving.
Somebody going home tonight.
Jaison, nowhere close at this
point.
37 days is a long time to lose
now.
Russell getting a little closer.
Mick getting closer.
Right now it is Brett, Russell,
and Mick.
You need to keep moving.
This challenge is going to end
soon.
Russell trying to pick up the
pace.
Brett very close.
Brett with only a couple of
pieces left.
Russell trying to scramble.
Mick hustling to finish.
Brett has it!
Brett wins immunity!
 Yeah.
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: Brett, come on over.
For the third time in a row,
Brett wins individual immunity.
Odds clearly stacked against
you, you continue to defy them.
Brett is safe at tonight's
Tribal Council.
One of the original Foa Foa
four going home after 37 days.
I don't envy this afternoon.
It's going to be an interesting
one.
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
I will see you at Tribal.
Congrats.
 Thanks.
If I didn't win immunity I
know I was going home.
I've been trying for some time
to get the Foa Foa tribe on the
jury, and tonight, at Tribal
will be the first time that
that's happened.
To finally see a Foa Foa member
go home will be relieving.
 It is absolutely the worst
feeling to have to go to Tribal
Council tonight.
All four of us Foa Foa have
been so tight, loyal, and
trustworthy to this point.
We have no other Galu to
pick off.
I mean, Brett won immunity.
There is no other option.
A Foa Foa has to go home and I
definitely feel like my head's
on the chopping block, clearly,
because I'm the weakest one.
I'm just... I'm hanging by
a thread.
So what's the plan?
I'm sure they want me.
 Yeah...
I'm gonna change it.
 Promise me?
 Yeah, I promise you.
 I've trusted you only from
the first day, so...
 If it was you, I'd tell you
right now.
 I know.
Just like I told you earlier,
it might be.
 I'm trying to keep Natalie
because she's holding on my
coattails.
Who better to take to the final
two than her?
There's no way she can beat me
in votes?
'Cause the next challenge, I
think I'll take the next one.
He's a kid, so he's going to
give it all he's got, but you
know what?
All backs are up against the
wall now.
 This is the hard part,
sitting here waiting for Tribal
Council.
Just going to go through the
motions and do what we can do
tonight.
And move on to tomorrow.
 Yup.
You guys know what you're doing
or up in the air?
 You know, you always think
you know what you're doing but
you never actually know what's
going to happen, you know.
 Yup.
 So...
 Oh!
 What's going on, man?
 I'm tired.
 A couple of days left.
 Jaison checked out of this
game a long time ago, and the
weakest link right now is
Jaison, even over Natalie.
She's stronger than him.
So the question is now Mick or
Jaison?
It's a good thing about keeping
Jaison is he can't beat me in
the votes.
The bad thing about keeping
Jaison is he can't beat Brett
in the challenge.
The good thing about keeping
Mick is he can possibly beat
Brett in the challenge.
The bad thing about keeping
Mick is Mick might beat me in
jury votes.
One of us is going home.
 Yeah, well, I mean, yeah--
 The only way me and you can
stay in the final three is
to keep Natalie.
We're gonna have to get rid of
of Mick.
 I agree.
We'll get rid of Mick and then
take another shot at Brett.
 Right.
 Yeah.
Russell and I have a very long
history of working together.
From, I think, day two we
decided we were going to have an
alliance and go to the finals
together and I think it's
just grown exponentially over
the last 37 days and I think
Russell and I trust each other
enough that we are comfortable.
When I say this, I mean it.
When he says that, he means it.
And so I really do think it will
be myself and Russell and
somebody else in the finals on
day 39.
 This is how it's going to go.
I mean, it's going to be Jaison
leaves tonight.
That gives us a shot to beat
Brett.
We cannot beat him for the
million dollars.
Jaison can't beat him in
anything.
 The plan is that it be
Jaison tonight.
I wish he could stay around,
but Natalie's head's much more
in the game than Jaison's.
He shows up, but he's not
really into it at all.
 If you agree with me on
that, we're cool.
 I agree with you on that.
 We'll go to the final three.
I promise you, we're going to
the final three.
 All right.
I like it.
Russell and I had a pact from
the very beginning that it
would be us in the final three.
And the fact that that's
actually on the horizon is a
little shocking.
 All right.
 Okay, done.
 I'm going to go look
this way.
You know, I told Mick to vote
Jaison, Jaison to vote Mick.
So you know, It's up to me and
Natalie if Mick goes home or
if Jaison goes home.
We're the ones making the
decision.
Well, let's discuss Mick or
Jaison.
 There are pros and cons to
both.
 So why do you think Jaison
should go tonight?
 He hasn't been feeling well
the last couple of days.
He's had nothing to drink.
 Why should we vote off Mick?
 Voting off Mick would ensure
that he'd be gone tonight, then
tomorrow if we win immunity,
then it's just me, you, and
Jaison in the top three and we
have a better chance.
 I could keep Mick.
I could keep Jaison.
They both have goods and bads.
So now I'm weighing it.
What in the world am I supposed
to do?
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Erik.
Kelly.
Laura.
John.
Dave.
Monica.
And Shambo, voted out at the
last Tribal Council.
All right, well, after seven
straight Tribal Councils in
which former Galu members were
voted out, finally, it comes
down to this-- one of the
former Foa Foa members is going
home tonight.
Jaison, when did the reality
really hit you that there was
nowhere to hide?
 Probably when I heard "Brett
wins immunity."
I mean, who thought he was
going to win three in a row?
You know, I came into this
challenge figuring it had to be
one of our times to take that
necklace back to move forward
with the four of us.
But clearly, that didn't happen.
 PROBST: So, Natalie, it seems
like there would be two very
different approaches to
tonight's vote.
 Absolutely.
I mean, if we don't beat Brett,
clearly, he's going to get
every single vote on the jury.
So do we keep the strongest
people that could possibly beat
Brett?
The other thought is, do I keep
someone that I think I can beat
in front of the jury?
 PROBST: Jaison, I'm guessing
the real dilemma is if I keep
the right people and we beat
Brett, but I keep the wrong
people because I can't beat the
guys I kept.
 Yeah.
And I think it's especially
difficult because there are two
or three people up here who
could command a lot of the jury
votes, so maybe it is better
just to try and take out the
next strongest competitor for
the jury, and see if we can get
lucky and get Brett next time.
 PROBST: Mick, who would have
guessed with only five people
left there would be so many
different layers of decision
making happening?
 My mindset has been Brett in
front of the jury equals a
million bucks.
So it makes sense to keep
people that can beat him at
this last immunity.
 PROBST: Your argument is all
hands on deck, got to take out
Brett.
 Right.
 PROBST: Jaison says all
hands on deck could ultimately
backfire because I still want
to win.
Why would that make sense?
 You're putting a lot more
pressure on yourself in saying I
think I can beat Brett.
And so far, it just hasn't
happened, man.
None of these old guys up here
has been able to take the kid
out.
 PROBST: Brett, up until now,
have you been sandbagging it
waiting to turn on the
afterburners?
 I think the past few
challenges have just coincided
with certain skills that I have
and having really nothing to
lose is a different frame of
mind that I have that these
people don't necessarily have.
 PROBST: Brett, what was it
like for you at camp today?
You got nothing to worry about.
These four had to be
scrambling.
 Yeah, but I think I'd rather
have the stress that they have.
I mean, you can't bank on
winning immunity challenges
forever to stay in this game.
Most of the time, you kind of
need that social component so
when you don't win, you
know, someone has your back and
they can take you to end.
 PROBST: Russell, a little
surprised that Brett would
actually prefer to be where you
guys are now?
 Yeah, because how hard is it
to beat Foa Foa, really, you
know?
We won one immunity challenge.
He wins three in a row...
(laughter)
You know, we're still getting
beat by Galu, but only one of
them is here.
 PROBST: Jaison, would you
gladly switch with Brett and
take the necklace tonight?
 Yeah. Who wouldn't want the
odds that he has right now.
He just has to win one more
challenge, and there might be
two of us in the finals, but if
he got there, he'd definitely
have the upper hand.
 PROBST: The reason I'm
bringing it up is we're at the
point in the game where how you
play the game is going to impact
the jury.
Brett, it's one thing to get to
the end.
It's another to have earned the
spot in the end.
 Yeah, I've won three
challenges in a row which is
great, but it don't mean
anything unless I can win the
next one.
So you got to stay humble in
this game and not feel too
strong in my own abilities to
potentially screw that up.
 PROBST: All right, let's get
to the vote.
Brett, I got to tell you, when
Tribal Council started, I
wasn't even going to bother
asking, but in light of your
comments, is there somebody
you want to give that necklace
to so you can switch spots?
 No, I'm going to keep it.
 PROBST: All right, you
cannot vote for Brett.
Everybody else is fair game.
It's time to vote.
Mick, you're up.
 This sucks.
I hate doing this, but I kind
of feel like you checked out a
long time ago.
So...
 Sorry, buddy, this was a
tough one.
 I hate that I have to do
this, but I got to keep to my
strategic play, and this is
the best move for me to win the
game.
 PROBST: I'll go tally
the votes.
Once the votes are read the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Mick.
Jaison.
One vote Mick, one vote Jaison.
Jaison.
Two votes Jaison, one vote Mick.
14th person voted out and the
eighth member of our jury,
Jaison.
There's three.
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Jaison, the tribe has spoken.
Congratulations on making it
to the final four.
Tomorrow you will compete in
your final immunity challenge.
Try to get a good night's sleep.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 I'm kind of pissed off at
Russell for blindsiding me.
For a relationship that you had
since day two you at least let
the guy know he's going home.
So I don't think I'd be
cheering for Russell in this
one.
I would root for Brett.
Brett is the underdog.
He is who we were.
We came from nothing to be
something and he did pretty
much the same thing on his own
to win three straight, maybe
four straight.
 Final four.
 Thank you, Lord.
 So few torches.
It's weird.
 Yes.
 It's definitely a miracle
for me to still be here as day
37 ends, and there are three
Foa Foas in the final four.
 Yes. Congratulations.
 Good work, bro.
 Final four.
 Final four.
 Final Foa.
 This is something I didn't
really imagine.
As I look towards the next
Tribal Council, you know, I
really feel like my fate is in
my own hands.
As of right now, the only thing
I'm banking on is really
winning another immunity
challenge because if I don't
win I'm probably going to be
the next person to go home.
 Me and you is in the
top three.
Do you think you can beat me?
 What?
 If you win the last immunity
idol, me and you is in the top
three, do you think you can
beat me?
 I don't know.
 Do you think it would be a
shot?
 It would be a...
I think it would be pretty
close.
 Brett won immunity.
That means he could possibly
win four immunity challenges in
a row.
That's a humungous threat.
Of the people that's here, if I
went to the final three, and I
got to choose, dude, I'm here
who deserves it more.
Trust me.
 Yeah.
 I'm here to win the game.
They should have three at the
top that deserve it the most.
 I'd rather go up against
someone that's harder to beat
and lose than to, like, put
myself in a position where I go
up against people that are
easier to beat and win.
 What I can promise you is me
and you will be in the top
three.
Have a seat, man.
 Yeah.
 So if you win it, then
you're safe, of course.
If I win it I'll take you to
top three.
If we win top three, we have no
doubts.
I'm going to do it straight up
with you.
Deal.
 Deal.
 Top three.
 Legitimate.
 I'm real on this.
 I'm real, too.
 Okay.
 This is a big one.
 You got to have some kind of
insurance policy in this game.
If he keeps winning, I got to
save myself.
Number one, uno, here.
I take care of me.
I don't take care of nobody
else this game.
So I'm sitting pretty right now.
I have a one-two spot with
every single person out here
right now, Natalie, Brett, and
Mick.
It looks like I'm going to be
in the top three no matter what.
 Ooh, it's a big one.
 If I win this challenge
today, I'm 100% positive that
the game is mine.
I won the million dollars.
You know, it's a very
interesting situation to be in,
but I love it.
This is how I want it to be.
 Tree mail!
Got a little note for you all.
All right.
"Congratulations, final four.
You are almost at the end of
the line.
Follow the map to the cliffs on
the coast.
There you will find the torches
of your fallen comrades.
At each torch, you will collect
a representative mask of those
who were voted out before you.
At the end of your journey, you
will burn them, paying your
respects as they each had a
part in getting you to this
point.
You will then proceed to your
final immunity challenge."
Each person that has been voted
out has played some role in how
I got where I am right now.
I mean, you know, every Tribal
Council I look at the jury, and
I see all the people that I
trusted, and so, you know, I'm
really fighting for them.
I'm fighting for the Galu tribe
that flourished in the first
half of this game and
floundered in the second half.
So it's definitely the
motivation for me to keep
pushing, to keep fighting, and
let the purple win.
 Marisa.
 Marisa!
 Marisa!
 I really believe if I
wouldn't have got rid of her
first, I wouldn't be here today.
 The men in my tribe really
came gunning for me.
They were really scared of
having any strong women on
their tribe and I was the
strongest woman on our tribe,
period.
And so I learned a great deal
about myself.
Being a strong woman is way
more important than getting any
kind of validation from a man.
 Mike Borassi.
 Wow.
 This is one of the most
headstrong competitors I think
on Foa Foa.
He wasn't going to hear "no."
 You know, he didn't even get
to play the game.
That's what sad about that.
 Yeah.
 I underestimated the
conditions and how severe it
can get.
It's a thousand times harder
than I thought it would be.
But I not only held my own.
I made them respect me, and
that's the whole thing.
You never give up, and you go
down swinging.
 Oh, Betsy.
 The only thing that I didn't
like is she told me was,
"Russell, you're playing this
game too hard."
You know what?
If you only play it 50%, even
starting at day one, this is
where you end up.
 I think being here rekindled
the desire to push myself to
the limits that I lost before I
had kids.
So now I tapped into that, and
I feel like a breath of fresh
air.
 Ben.
 Oh, Ben.
 I think he had no idea how
to play it socially.
 Right.
 None.
 I wasn't sorry to see him go.
 I think I'm a little
misinterpreted.
I was very brutally honest with
everybody.
People can't handle that.
They don't want to hear about
themselves.
They don't want to hear the
truth because the truth hurts.
I'm truthful with myself.
I know myself.
And if the survival aspect of
this game was just survival, I
would kill all these people.
Our girl, Yas!
 Yasmin!
 That girl is just such a--
such a character, such a
crack-up.
 At the end of the day, the
girl from the 'hood did do
pretty good.
I learned to keep trusting
myself.
That is something I will
continue to do and I also
learned one other thing, I
won't be going camping.
(laughing)
 Ashley.
 She was my little sister.
I loved her.
 My strategy was to make a
really strong alliance, and it
didn't work.
I got played.
Russell made an alliance with
every single person, and he's a
snake.
And he called the shots.
If he wanted you out, you were
out.
 Big Russ, the heart and soul
to the Galu tribe.
You guys don't know.
This is the man that propelled
us to so many victories.
 Tenacious.
That guy was tenacious in
challenges.
I mean, we hated to see him go,
but stoked to see him go as
well.
 Being taken out of the game
for medical reasons is the most
demoralizing thing I've ever
felt.
I believe a man is supposed to
provide for his family.
I was going to win that million
dollars.
But for my wife and my
daughter, knowing that they're
there waiting on me to come
home, if it wasn't for them, I
would have rather died that day.
 Liz.
 She was physical.
Let me tell you.
 She was.
 She was a rock star,
for sure.
 I would never have
characterized myself as
somebody who was patient before.
And now I have known the
depths of patience.
You know, when you go without
food and you go without a lot
of the creature comforts that
you're used to, you have
nothing but patience.
 Erik.
All the big moves we made in
this game, Foa Foa, Galu made
the first big move for us.
 Fierce competitor.
 Fierce, fierce competitor.
 He was.
 Almost psycho?
(all laugh)
 I experienced betrayal, but
the most perfect thing happened;
I was betrayed so that I could
leave indicators for that
betrayal.
Voting me out was the downfall
of Galu.
And so I am completely content
with how things ended up.
 Oh, Kelly!
 Kel dawg, my homegirl.
 The funny thing is, in this
game, I feel like the men are
always terrified of the women,
which totally makes sense now,
so I got sent home.
Definitely had a lot of fight
left in me for the game.
I could have done it.
 Little Laura.
 Such a strong competitor.
 I was clearly, like, one of
the oldest people that was
out there.
You know what?
You still can't beat me.
I mean, even at my age, even
being a grandma, I'm totally
re-stereotyping the grandma.
You can't beat this grandma.
 There's John.
He tried to make a move with
me, along with me and Shambo.
For some reason, he thought I
was telling him the truth.
 Being part of a highly
effective team is something
that I'm used to.
But your ability to connect
with idiots who can't process
things properly is a large part
of what this comes down to.
It's like you only have so much
control over the way people
do things.
But I don't think I had a
better move than what I did.
 Danger Dave Ball.
 Danger Dave.
 Danger Dave Ball.
 What a man.
 Hilarious.
 I'm not really the easiest
person to grasp.
I'm not the easiest person to
get along with.
I can be a jerk...
but I can also be fairly warm
and compassionate.
I would like to be, you know,
appreciated and accepted for
who I am, but I've kind of
learned to be okay with being
misunderstood.
 Monica!
 You know, I got to be honest
with you guys, I think Monica
was the fakest person here.
 Well...
 I think she wanted
to go out...
 ...with a bang.
 a fight.
 With a bang, yeah.
 And that girl is
a firecracker.
 She was a firecracker.
 I give that girl much credit.
 You gear up for these
challenges.
I mean, I look around me and I
see a lot of these really well-
apt competitors and that fear of
failure is so dark and
it's scary.
And then you come to a point
where you're, like,
"You know what?
"I'm gonna do this for myself,
"and I'm gonna put it all
out there."
And that is in itself is
winning a million dollars.
 Shambo!
 Shambo!
 You guys give this girl
much prop.
 Definitely.
 Without her you guys would
not be standing here.
 We would not be here if it
weren't for Shambo.
 That is for darn sure.
 I was alienated, shunned,
disrespected, and the funny
thing is, in my entire life, I
have been the uplifter of the
the underdog.
So to be the one that was the
victim was just a bizarre
eye-opening experience.
It doesn't hurt my self-esteem.
It makes me incredibly proud
and happy that God made me the
person that I am.
Lift people up...
don't tear 'em down.
 The last fallen survivor...
 ALL: Jaison.
 Jaison-- a great competitor,
super smart guy.
I mean the guy is, uh... we'll
be voting for senator for him
before we know it, I think.
 Oh, yeah.
 I was having a really,
really, really, really, really
difficult time.
But I am really proud of myself
for not quitting, and so I think
that I take away from this a
new confidence in myself to be
able to get through difficult,
hard times because I've
been so miserable.
(groans)
 An ode to our fallen
survivors.
 We pay our respects.
We wouldn't be here without you.
♪ ♪
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to your
final immunity challenge?
 Yes.
 Let's do it.
 I guess so.
 PROBST: I'll take it back
once again, Brett.
For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.
Today's challenge will require
balance and concentration.
Here's how it works: on my
"go," you will each place a
wooden statue on the end
of a pole.
At regular intervals, you'll
add another section of pole,
making it more difficult to
keep stable.
The statue falls off, you're
out of the challenge.
Last person left standing wins
immunity and is guaranteed a
spot at the final Tribal
Council where you will get a
chance to plead your case in
front of the jury for
a million dollars.
Very simple.
Shall we get to it?
 Yes.
 Let's do it.
 PROBST: Take your spots.
We'll get started.
All right, everybody take your
statue, place it on your first
section of pole.
Make sure you like where it's
at, and then you'll have to
take your hand off the statue,
and we'll be started.
All right, five, four, three,
two, one.
This challenge is on.
(Russell exhales sharply)
All right, you have 30 seconds
to add another section of pole
starting now.
You got to reach for that
section of pole, get it in the
slot, get your hands back down
on that lowest section.
That little white marker,
that's your boundary.
You don't want to go above that.
If your statue falls off,
you're out of the challenge.
We will keep adding another
section of pole every two
minutes until only one player
is left.
♪ ♪
Don't panic.
Don't rush.
You have plenty of time.
Mick is the first one out of
the challenge.
Natalie's now out of the
challenge.
We're down to two.
Russell and Brett.
Each of you are now holding
six feet.
One former Foa Foa,
one former Galu.
There are no secrets out here.
Brett needs to win to move to
that final Tribal Council.
Russell would love to take him
out and go to final Tribal with
Mick and Natalie and have a
shot at winning.
This is quite possibly the
million-dollar challenge.
The wind's starting
to pick up a little bit now.
Affecting both guys.
Good recovery.
Here we go.
It is time to add another
section of pole.
This will put you at seven feet.
This is when it gets
really tricky.
Take your time.
You have 30 seconds to make
the transition.
It starts now.
Brett quickly goes for his.
Russell waiting.
Got ten seconds left.
Five, four,
three,
two, one.
Another successful transition.
You're now at seven feet.
Brett starting to wobble.
Nice recovery.
This is a showdown.
Russell starting to wobble.
Brett falls off.
Russell wins individual
immunity, his first and it
couldn't have come at a better
time.
 Good job, Brett.
 PROBST: Russell, come on
over.
 This is the time I wanted it.
 PROBST: Russell wins the
final individual immunity
challenge.
You're going to the final
Tribal Council.
You will get a chance to plead
your case in front of the jury
as to why you deserve a million
dollars.
Natalie, Mick, Brett, one of
you going home tonight.
Your shot at a million dollars
will come to an end.
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
See you at Tribal tonight.
 I won immunity today.
This is worth a million dollars
right now.
In my opinion, I just won the
game.
 Great job.
It was awesome.
Phenomenal, Russ.
 Finally got it around your
neck, my friend.
 Finally got it.
Congrats, man.
 So final immunity challenge,
it was our last-ditch effort to
beat Brett, and Russell and
Brett came down to just a
nail-biter.
It was just... I mean, watching
these things back and forth.
And you're just like Russell is
shaking, Brett looks focused.
Now Brett's swinging.
I mean, it was really, really
intense.
And once Brett's fell it was
just this... (sighs)
this sigh of relief.
 How you doing?
 I'm doing great.
Really good.
I mean, really your fate is out
of your own hands at this point.
Whether you won or lost that
challenge, whether someone goes
home tonight or makes it
till-- till the end, I'm
definitely proud--
I really am proud to make it
this far, so...
 Well, you should be.
You had a pretty amazing streak
there.
 It's definitely-- definitely
been an awesome experience,
for sure.
I'm like a little girl, all
emotional.
 Well deserved.
 Yeah.
I failed.
Because I was unable to win the
immunity challenge today, I'm
pretty certain that I'll be
going home tonight.
The only thing I have to fall
back on is Russell's deal that
he made with me that if one of
us were to win, we would take
the other person to the finals.
 So what do you all think of
my chances of winning a million
dollars now?
 I think that you're going to
win, hands down.
 Because now that I took out
Brett, and I played the game.
 I think hands down you'll
win.
 I think I've got a good shot
now, man.
 You've got a great shot.
 I do, too.
 So what do you think Galu is
going to say when they see me
walk in with that?
 I think they're going to be,
like, ticked in a way, but
then...
 I think they're going to say
it's fitting.
You know, I've played it
strategically the whole time,
and then at the very end when
the biggest threat that I had to
me to win the money, I had to
beat, and I did.
So, you know, it's going to be
part of my speech now.
 Yeah.
 Throw me the coconut over
there, would you?
 I wish I was like him when I
was his age.
You know what I mean?
He's the kind of guy that I
want my daughters to meet one
day.
You know, really.
 Yes, you would.
He will be a fantastic husband
and father.
He's just a great kid.
 I made a promise to Brett,
telling him that me, Brett, and
Natalie will go to the final
three.
But, you see, I made a promise
to Mick, too.
So either way I slice it, if I
break my promise with somebody,
I'll be putting them on the
jury, they'll taking it
personal-- that hates me.
This is where the game gets
tough.
 What's going on, guys?
 What?
 There some funny business
going on?
 Uh-uh. What do you mean?
 I don't know, I've never
seen Russell want to go get
wood.
Maybe I'm just, I'm kind of a
skeptic, I guess.
I just don't really-- I don't
know.
 No matter what, we get to be
clean tomorrow.
 At some point.
 And eat.
Eat and be clean.
 I almost want to cry.
 I know.
 See? What's going on?
 Mick, you're fine.
Do not-- you're the most
paranoid person.
 I've never seen Russell go
get firewood ever in 39 days.
 Mick.
Yeah?
You are so paranoid.
Have I let you down yet?
Have I?
 Everybody's talking about me.
 Are you on drugs?
Do you honestly think any of us
want to go against him on
the jury?
No!
 I wouldn't think so, but
Russ has all these little
strange plans and ploys.
 No, no, Mick.
It's done.
It's a done deal.
 Good, man.
 You're coming back here
tonight, and so am I, and so is
Russell.
It's the three of us.
We're coming back here.
 You know that I made a deal
with you.
The problem I'm weighing in my
mind is I made a deal with
everybody.
And you're the kind of guy I
want my kids to marry.
You're the kind of guy I want
my daughters-- I wish I was
like you when I was your age.
And I ain't just saying that.
 And I appreciate that.
 So the only option we have is
Natalie is going to vote you,
and Mick is going to vote you.
If I vote Mick...
 And I vote Mick.
 ...and you vote Mick, then
it's a 2-2 tie.
 Yeah.
 And then it's a challenge, it
might be a fire challenge.
Do you think you could beat
Mick in a fire challenge?
It's like you still have
another challenge.
You're still working your way
to the end?
 Yeah.
 Russell and I have talked
over agreements for each other
previously in this game.
It's hard to take his word 100%
and know that he's going to
stick behind it.
All I can really do right now
is hope that he's, you know, a
man of his word, and will fall
back on his actions.
 I've been wearing a
necklace-for a long time in
this game.
The hidden immunity idol.
And I finally get the real deal.
Definitely better late than
never, because look where
it came.
It came on the last one.
The one that puts me in front
of the jury to win this game.
Right now, you have to worry
about jury votes.
And that's all I'm thinking
about right now.
How can I get more jury votes?
Brett's a real good guy.
I like Brett a lot.
Mick, he's a good guy, too.
But I'm playing a game.
I'm still strongly considering
keeping Brett.
May the best man win.
Everybody would be shocked if I
did that.
But you know what?
I think that might get me jury
votes-- keeping the strongest
here.
My head's spinning now.
It gets tougher and tougher.
Every time you think it can't
get any tougher than this, but
now I'm damned if I do and I'm
damned if I don't.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Erik.
Kelly.
Laura.
John.
Dave.
Monica.
Shambo.
And Jaison, voted out at the
last Tribal Council.
So let's talk about today, your
final immunity challenge.
Mick, you're out first, Natalie
right behind.
Leaves us with the showdown.
Russell and Brett.
Russell, this had to be how you
wanted it to go down, going up
against a guy who's been a very
strong competitor in this game.
 Definitely.
I knew he would be the one that
would be there with me at the
end, and I thought, I lose, I
go home.
I came to win.
I didn't come to even come
second.
So I put more effort into this
challenge than I have into
anything in this entire game.
 PROBST: Brett, did you figure
it would be Russell that might
be the one to give you a run
for your money?
 Oh, yeah, I mean without
a doubt.
He's got the mentality that is
"I have to win."
and that's the mindset I've
been having the past few
immunity challenges.
 PROBST: Mick, the minute
Brett goes out of this challenge
and he's vulnerable, did you
know that's it, he's going home?
 Yeah, absolutely, right away.
You know what I mean.
He's been such a competitor,
but it was a huge relief.
 PROBST: Natalie, no doubt in
your mind?
Easy decision?
 Yes. Absolutely.
 PROBST: Now, Russell, is
there a part of you that can
appreciate the competitor in
Brett?
The guy has lasted a long time
with the odds against him.
 Right.
He played a great game.
And it's because I respect the
game so much, he deserves to be
sitting up there with me.
I mean, you know, we're
probably the two best up here.
And you want the best with you
to talk in front of jury.
You know, that's just how it
should be.
 PROBST: Mick, surprised by
Russell's comment about maybe
it's fair to take Brett to the
end because he's earned it more
than somebody else up here?
 Yeah, I think he makes a
pretty good case.
I mean, it's not one I would
agree with per se.
I would tend to think the
opposite.
You know, Brett going in front
of that jury, none of us have a
chance at a million bucks.
 PROBST: Natalie, a little
surprised?
 No, actually, I'm not
surprised.
Because, again, Brett has been
an outstanding competitor.
But Russell knows
strategically, it's not a good
move at all to take Brett and
put Brett in front of the jury.
 PROBST: Brett, do you sense a
little bit of worry from
Natalie and Mick?
I'm even hearing it, Natalie,
right now, almost like she's
talking to Russell saying, "You
know that's not a good move,
right?"
 Well, I mean, if Russ truly
felt that he wanted to go up
against the best, you know,
they've got to be a little
worried.
 PROBST: If Russell made a
vote to keep you in the game, do
you think Russell then earns
respect from the jury?
 Oh, yeah.
Most definitely.
I mean, by that action, you're
showing a sense of confidence
within yourself and shows quite
a bit of character to say, hey,
you might beat me at this, but
I'm going to put you up against
me and we'll put it to the test.
 PROBST: So based on what I'm
hearing you guys say, what at
one point was an absolute
certainty, Brett going home,
now has a bit of suspense.
We'll see how it plays out.
Russell has the individual
immunity necklace.
I know you're not giving it up.
You cannot vote for Russell.
Everybody else is fair game.
Mick, you're up.
 Hell of a competitor, man.
Props to you.
I got nothing but love for you.
 (whispers): Brett, I'm voting
for you because we have no shot
at beating you at the final.
 PROBST: Russell.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Brett.
Mick.
One vote Mick, one vote Brett.
Brett.
Two votes Brett, one vote Mick.
One vote left.
15th person voted out and the
ninth and final member of our
jury, Brett.
You need to bring me your torch.
Brett, the tribe has spoken.
 Great game, guys.
 Bye, Brett.
 Thanks for the adventure.
 PROBST: Well, you have gone a
far as you can go in this game.
Tomorrow you will get a chance
to plead your case to the jury
about why you deserve the
million dollars and the title
of sole survivor.
You have one more night in
in Samoa.
Hope you can enjoy it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 I knew, you know, a couple
of Tribals ago that it was my
time to go.
And you know, I'm the last Galu
member, which I'm so proud of
that, you know.
To get to where I got, 38 days,
one of the final four.
It was definitely a testament
to my will and hard work, and
kind of felt like I went out on
my own accord to some degree.
 I can't wait to brush and
floss my teeth.
 No more bamboo.
 Let's go check tree mail.
 I'm ready.
 Me, too.
Oh, my word.
 Strawberries?
 Oh, my goodness.
Pancake mix.
 Sausage and onions.
Civilization.
Oh!
 Sausage. Oh, my goodness.
Grab that one end.
(cork pops)
 Yay! We're here on day 39.
 Yes, indeed.
I think we need a toast.
Final three.
 Final three, Foa Foa.
 From the get-go.
 May the best man win.
You know, I said from day one I
was gonna get here,
and here I am.
 Wow. Very good.
Isn't that great?
 Not only did I get here,
I brought two people here that
I wanted to be here with me.
They're gonna say I took you
the whole way.
They're gonna say you
couldn't have made it without
Russell.
What you gonna say?
 It's in God's hand at this
point.
If I'm not meant to win,
that's fine.
I'm happy I made it
to the third.
 You see, you haven't been
thinking about your speech too
much, then.
 Russell, no, I...
All of them questions.
 Guess what.
Look who I aligned with
from the first day.
 Oh, you, so you saying
you set up the alliance.
 No. Okay.
 So what did do you
strategically in this game?
If you want second place, you
have to do better than that.
 What about Mick?
He was the nice guy, you know.
 Well, don't think I'm going
to eat up on that, too.
I'm just saying, here behind me
I have sitting the nice guy and
the nice girl.
Have they outwitted me?
Have they outplayed me?
If they have, then give them
the money because
they deserve it, so...
 Russell has good points,
but he needs to be reminded
that he couldn't have done this
without us.
I was a trustworthy,
hardworking, likable guy, and I
got to the same place
ultimately that Russell did.
We just took totally different
paths to do it.
So, you know, some people may
say, "Well, I liked your path a
"little better.
Here's my vote."
 Ease up...
please.
I think there may be a little
bit of strategy involved to
Russell making us feel like
we're not gonna win or that
we don't have a chance, but I
have news for him.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'll
just explain to the jury,
I don't work the same way as
Russell.
That would clearly not have
worked for me.
The girls that were aggressive,
they got eliminated early.
My strategy was to be myself,
and at the end of the day, you
know, I wasn't out to get
anybody or make anybody look
look bad.
Russell made it clear he was
okay with making people
look bad.
(chuckles)
 I never want to sleep on
bamboo ever again.
 Hell, no.
I'm not gonna be rained on
ever again.
 Me, either!
 I'm not sleeping in the
cold ever again.
Toss it up.
This is the best fire we've
had yet.
 Burn, baby, burn.
 Whoo!
 If Mick or Natalie won this
game over me, that would just
be a shame.
You know, it wouldn't make any
sense to me.
I played this game
strategically better than
anybody, maybe in history.
I really think this jury's
gonna put my name down.
I've accomplished the
impossible out here
all by myself and brought
a couple of bums with me.
I feel strong.
I feel good.
I feel like I'm gonna go
into this, make a great speech,
and take it.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury:
Erik.
Kelly.
Laura.
John.
Dave.
Monica.
Shambo.
Jaison and Brett, voted out at
the last Tribal Council.
Well, congratulations on making
it to the final three.
Tonight, the power in this game
shifts to the jury.
Nine people that you had a hand
in voting out now control your
fate in their hands.
Very unique situation this
season in that all three of you
voted for every single person
on the jury.
So nobody has anywhere to hide.
You will each get an opening
statement.
This is your chance to convince
them why you deserve it.
The jury will then get a chance
to address you.
They're gonna be trying to
gather information to help them
decide who they think is most
worthy of the title of sole
survivor and the million-dollar
check that goes along with it.
Then we will vote.
Everybody ready to get to it?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Opening statements.
Mick, you're up.
 All right.
Uh, good evening, everyone.
You know, I came into this game
realizing that under the stress
of this whole process that
there would be a lot of
pressure to sort of give
yourself a little more moral
sort of leeway than maybe I was
willing to give.
As underdogs coming in, I think
that temptation is especially
strong to do whatever it takes
to keep your head above water.
I just played my whole game
within sort of these parameters
I really wasn't that willing to
go outside of.
I made it a point not to
promise too much.
Not to overtly stomp on, lie or
mislead people or to treat them
like sort of pawns in this game.
The fact that I was able to get
this far by doing that,
you know, that was kind of my
goal in this, and I feel like I
accomplished it.
 PROBST: Natalie, your opening
statement.
 You know, I came into this
game with a lot of people
telling me before I ever came,
"What are you doing?
"You're crazy.
You can't do it."
And I knew I would wake up every
single day, if I didn't come do
this, I would have regrets.
And for me, it was definitely
about wanting to, um, just gain
the confidence to go outside my
comfort zone.
This is the hardest thing I've
ever done mentally, physically,
emotionally.
This experience has been very
humbling for me.
And without each and every one
of you, I would not be sitting
sitting here.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Russell, your opening
statement.
 Mine's going to be a little
bit different than these two.
I came here to do what I said I
was going to do and try to make
if all the way to the top and
win the game.
I made huge strategic moves all
the way through the game.
My first strategic moves were
in my own tribe.
Marisa and Betsy.
Those were the two that said
"Get rid of Russell.
Get rid of Russell."
Guess who goes first?
Marisa and Betsy.
When we go to Galu, I have
these guys right here behind me
while I'm getting shot at.
I solidified myself with Shambo
to get rid of Kelly.
It was a huge move.
It didn't change the game yet.
Laura was the biggest move I
think of the game.
I had to go to John and say,
"John, if you help switch your
vote, I'll vote off a Foa Foa
member."
So he agrees.
He switches his vote at the end.
Laura goes home.
Then John comes to me after
it's over, "We've got to get
rid of a Foa Foa."
Well, I can't do that, so I
have to get rid of John.
Then it just went like dominoes
from there.
The huge move was the most
difficult, trying to get rid of
Brett.
He won three immunity idols in
a row.
So I have to win physically to
get rid of Brett.
Now, I ask you, if either one
of these outwit me, then give
them the money.
If either one of these
out-played me, then give them
the game.
But you know what?
I don't think that they have.
The truth is where it lies.
It's y'all's big decision to
make tonight, and may the best
man win.
 PROBST: All right, three very
different opening statements.
Jury, in a moment, you're going
to get your first chance to
address Mick, Natalie, and
Russell.
I'll give you minute to think
about what you want to ask them.
 PROBST: All right, jury.
You've heard the opening
statements from Mick, Natalie,
and Russell.
It's now your first chance to
address them.
You're trying to gather
information to help you make a
million-dollar decision.
Let's get started.
Jaison.
You're up first.
 Well, congratulations.
I'm going to give you guys an
opportunity to look at the jury
and give them some information
about who you really are, and
if you don't, I will.
 I'll start.
 Go ahead.
 I was in pharmaceutical
sales before I came.
I gave up my job, so
technically, I am unemployed at
this time but that is my dream
job.
I want to find one when I go
back home.
 Russell?
 I'm a businessman.
I opened a business five years
ago, struggled for three years,
just became successful with the
business for two years.
This is the first business that
I have succeeded with.
That's what I do.
 Mick?
 I finished medical school.
I'm 320 odd grand in debt from
that.
And it's going to take me a
long time to pull out of debt.
I'm almost 35, and that's me.
 I don't think any of them
have lied.
But Natalie, you know, neglects
to tell you that she has made a
lot of money.
Russell, probably the
wealthiest guy on this panel,
seven figures in the last year
or so, he says.
You know, Mick, doctors do get
paid very well, especially when
you get fellowships at one of
the most prestigious hospitals
in America.
So whatever decision is made,
no one is broke.
I think you guys should look to
other criteria.
That's all I have to say.
 PROBST: Thanks, Jaison.
Shambo, you're up.
 Hi, guys.
I would just like to apologize
to America for dismantling Galu
because I'm really questioning
that judgment call at this
point.
Mick, wow.
Dude, you have got to be
kidding me.
In a word, would you agree that
your overall game playing could
be called...
 Here it comes.
 ...feckless.
 Feckless?
 I would have to look up
feckless.
I don't know what feckless is.
 Well, I think that's a really
good idea after this is over.
I'm done with you.
 Okay, will do, Shambo.
 Natalie the word that just
is resonating in my mind that
starts with a "C."
Can you finish it?
I'm going to let you finish it,
Sham.
 Coattail.
How do you think America is
going to perceive you sitting
up there in the final three?
Give it to me, Natalie.
 I think America is going to
say she came the most
ill-equipped in a sundress and
gold wedges.
She should have been voted out
first.
And you know what, I had enough
intuition to notice that girl
that goes out aggressive,
target, gone.
Marisa and Betsy.
That's not smart.
 I'm calling just major B.S.
on your sentence that you just
hit me with.
I'm, like, cracking up inside
like you have no idea.
 Okay.
 The jig is up.
Natalie, Mick, no way in God's
green Earth you're getting my
my vote.
Thanks for playing.
 Thank you, Sham.
 Thank you.
 Wow.
 Wow, is right.
 PROBST: Brett, you're up.
 Well, first of all,
congratulations.
I'm definitely proud of you
guys for, you know, at least
beating us.
So, Mick, imagine for a moment
you and I are going on a little
bro-date together.
What kind of stuff-- what
kind of stuff would we do?
 Wait, wait, wait, what is it?
 You and I are going to go on
a bro date together.
Nothing sexual.
Just a little guy time.
So describe what that day would
entail.
 I'll wake you up with a
little sweet nothing in
your ear...
(laughter)
 That's a good beginning.
 ...a little tickle on
the nose.
No, but, uh, no, we'd get up.
We'd check out the news, and
grab some eats afterwards, and
you know, just be guys and talk
about girls and, you know,
sports and stuff like that.
 All right, sounds good.
It sounds probably like a silly
question, but basically the
reason I was asking is to see to
what level did you invest with
myself as a human being.
I appreciate your response.
You're almost done.
We'll get some food shortly.
 Thanks. Thanks, man.
 PROBST: Kelly.
 Hi.
Nat, I'm going to start with
you.
Because I think in the
beginning, we were perceived as
being very similar, you know.
We were both a little bit
underestimated.
I had to rely on myself.
I was hoping for the same thing
in you.
I don't think you were ever on
the field.
I saw you always turn to call
help, whether it be these two
or someone else in every
challenge.
 Can I answer to that?
 Yeah, go ahead.
 It wasn't because I had no
fight.
I've given this 100%.
Yeah, maybe I'm not as good at
some of the physical challenges
as some other people.
I think everybody outweighed
me, but I did do things on my
own, and I'll tell you, I got
better throughout the game to
believe in myself.
 Russell, you've said many
times you're going to lie,
cheat, and steal your way
through this game.
Does that apply to your
real life also?
 No, not at all.
I am 100% different outside this
game.
The thing that bothered me is I
don't want my kids to think
that this is how I really am.
I'm not like this at all.
I'm a totally different person
outside this game.
 Instead of lie, cheat, and
steal in real life, maybe what
three words that would replace
that?
 It might be hard to believe
but honor, integrity, and
loyalty.
 Russell, it's hard for me to
sit here and believe that from
you.
"Honor, integrity, and loyalty"
is the most important thing
to you?
 It is the most important
thing to me.
 I guess I've heard what I
need to.
Good luck.
 PROBST: Thanks, Kelly.
Monica.
 First off, I just want to
say congratulations.
Russell, you played some key
moves, and regardless of how
you got there, you're there.
Natalie, Mick, both of you seem
to have played a pretty honest
game, but I did miss passion.
I want to see the fight in your
answer for my question tonight.
Mick, tell me why each of the
two people alongside you do not
deserve the million dollars and
you do.
 You know, I don't think
Natalie deserves the money at
all.
I don't know, you know, what
she really did along the way
except align with Russell.
And through their relationship
and their trust, was able to
get through the game.
That was it.
Russell was willing to lie to
people, pit people against each
other, mislead anybody, and all
the while, you know, this giant
ego just got really kind of out
of hand and obsessive and I
don't think that that kind of
character behavior deserves a
million bucks.
You don't reward that.
 Can I say something?
You know, he's sitting over
here saying I pit people
against each other.
You pit people against each
other, also.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
 And also, this next thing...
 We're trying to-- I'm
answering her question.
 I asked if I could speak.
He didn't mind when I was being
a snake and giving me
high-fives every time we vote
somebody off.
 I never gave you high-fives.
 Natalie didn't mind when I
was being a snake and giving me
high-fives when I voted
everybody off.
The two honest people here--
they were congratulating me.
"Good job.
That was probably one of the
best jobs in history, Russell
You are doing... you are
running...
You should win this game.
You're running the show here."
 You did a great job.
Those were great moves.
 They both-- they both didn't
mind following the snake right
behind me the whole step of the
way.
 I think I'm basically done.
 PROBST: Dave.
 Hey, everybody.
I do have one thing.
I'm curious, I'm just going to
ask everybody, what do you
think your chances are tonight?
What do you think, Mick?
 My chances are, after this,
maybe 25%, 20%.
 Natalie, what do you think
your chances are?
 I'm going with maybe 30.
 30%?
 30% to 40% chance.
 Right on. Good game, Mama.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome. Great job.
What do you say, Russ?
 I came in here with a lot
larger percentage but it went
down to about 55%.
 55?
 Yeah, I think that it's...
it just might happen, might
not happen.
 All right, thanks everybody.
 Thanks, Dave.
 Yeah, you bet.
 PROBST: Laura, you're up.
 Hi.
Russell, what did you learn
about me that enabled you to
beat me?
 I knew immediately you was
the biggest threat on Galu, and
that you were controlling a lot.
That's what I thought.
Whether that was true or not, I
don't know.
But if-if it wouldn't have took
place like it did, I don't have
a doubt in my mind you would be
here right now.
 PROBST: Thanks, Laura.
John, your turn.
 Mick, give me the hard sell.
Why should I write your name
down?
Hard sell, blow my mind
right now.
 In terms of character you're
not going to find a better,
more solid guy up here.
You're just not.
I'm one of those people that
does not think that the ends
justify the means and you
don't treat people like pawns.
That's not my way of
maneuvering through life or the
game.
That's essentially the type of
person that you're giving
money to.
I don't think you can give it
to a more stand-up dude up here.
I just don't.
 Good.
Natalie, you admittedly got
here tucked under Russell's
wing.
And I value that.
But what do you say to the
person who's thinking, you know
what, you've got to win it
now, kid.
 It's not that you tuck under
someone's wing.
It's you're smart enough to see
why are they taking these
people out?
The most aggressive female was
voted out first.
I saw that from day one.
Betsy was gone second.
Liz was gone.
I was the last girl standing.
I killed a rat, for crying out
loud.
 Not to interrupt, but you're
definitely illuminating part of
your strategic thinking that I
think some of us were hoping to
see tonight.
Thanks to all of you.
That was fun.
 PROBST: Thanks, John.
Erik, close it out.
 I'm going to try to keep
this brief, but I don't need
anything from any of you.
Mick, day one, they put a
leadership necklace around your
neck.
I go 39 days struggling to find
a reason that you deserve that
title.
You did nothing.
You did nothing with your team.
You did nothing to encourage
them.
Nobody on that team had any
guts.
You're responsible for that.
Russell, this hurts me.
We have nothing in common.
You played an unethical game,
admittedly played an unethical
game.
The crazy thing about it is is
you're sitting there and I'm
standing here.
Did you get to the right place
by behaving the wrong way?
I've never been in a situation
in my entire life where that he
was the case, but you sit there
proud of it.
Natalie, people will call you
weak.
People will say that you are
undeserving.
But you know what?
Why are those characteristics
any less admirable as lying,
cheating, and stealing?
Why does he get a free pass,
but your wrong way of playing
is admonished.
If there's one thing that I
learned in this game it is that
perception is not reality.
Reality is reality.
And you are sitting there and
that makes you just as
dangerous as any one of those
guys there.
You would say that you were
probably the least deserving of
the title of sole survivor.
But maybe, just maybe, in an
environment filled with
arrogance, delusional
entitlement, maybe the person
who thinks that she's least
deserving is probably the most.
You got my vote.
I hope you get four more.
Congratulations.
 PROBST: Jury, thanks for a
very lively and interesting
Tribal Council.
In a moment, the nine of you
are each going to make a
million-dollar vote.
I'm going to give you a moment
to take all of this in, figure
out what you want to do.
 PROBST: All right, jury,
we've had a very interesting
final Tribal Council due in no
small part to the fact that
we've had three finalists who
played very different games, and
based on the questions tonight,
I can tell it is still up in
the air.
So it is time to get to the
votes.
Tonight you are voting for a
winner.
The person you think most
deserving of the title of sole
survivor, and the million
dollars that goes along with it.
For the last time, it is time
to vote.
Laura, you're up.
 You came a long way and I
think that's something to be
proud of.
Enjoy this.
I hope you get it, buddy.
You're the only one up there
that is deserving of $1 million
in my humble opinion.
 PROBST: I'll go get the
votes.
I know 39 days is a long time
out here.
Thank you for a great season of
Survivor.
See you back in Los Angeles for
the reading of the votes.
(cheering and applause)
 PROBST: How's everybody
doing.
You guys all right?
Have a seat.
Thanks for the nice welcome.
It is nice to be live for the
reading of the votes.
First of all, I want to give a
hand to you guys.
This was a very, very tough
season.
(cheering and applause)
I watched what you guys went
through.
I can vouch for it.
You have my respect regardless
of how well you did in the
game, just embarking on this
adventure.
So here's where we stand.
We're down to three, Mick,
Natalie, Russell.
And a jury of your peers, nine
people that you played
alongside, will now decide the
outcome.
It's one of the unique aspects
of Survivor, that you guys
control the world.
You make up the rules.
You decide how it goes.
So while Mick, Natalie, and
Russell, you got to the end,
you put yourself in a
position to win the money--
that's not enough.
You need the votes.
Let's get to it.
There are nine votes in here.
These are votes for a winner.
I will now read the votes.
First vote, "Ratalie."
(cheers)
That's one for Natalie.
Russell.
(cheers)
One vote Natalie, one vote
Russell.
Natalie.
(cheers)
Two votes Natalie, one vote
Russell.
Russell.
(cheers)
We're tied.
Two votes Natalie, two votes
Russell.
Natalie.
(cheers)
That's three votes Natalie,
two votes Russell.
Natalie.
(cheers)
Four votes Natalie, two votes
Russell.
It takes five to win.
The winner of Survivor: Samoa,
Natalie.
(cheering and applause)
 Good job, man.
You kept your head up.
 Good job, Jaison.
You look good.
 Good job, Shambo.
(cheers and applause)
