 --- 

         I'll trust you, so, do I have
that same trust with you?
 Yes.
 I want people to think that,
hey, it's really smart for them
to take me to the end because
they can beat me.
(sighing)
 PROBST: No score for Natalie.
 No, no!
 This is the hardest thing








I've ever done.
Oh, my word!
But make no mistake.
I'm not gonna give up.
 PROBST: Natalie is making up
the lost time.
Natalie places it for Foa Foa!
Natalie hanging out of that
cradle.
 Eat your snack, buddy.
Oh, gosh! Oh, my word!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't trust Erik.
My strategy was to build good








relationships, be underestimated
and be the last one standing.
(applause and cheering)
(band plays upbeat rock music)
 PROBST: It is the live
Survivor: Samoa Reunion Show.
Natalie, congratulations.
 Thank you so much.
(cheers and applause)
Thank you all.
 PROBST: Now, let's talk
about...
Before you got on the show, this
was not an easy decision.
You were back and forth.
You missed your plane to come to
casting several times.
You ended up having to quit
your job.
What was it that might... that
finally made you say, "Yes, I'm
going to do this?"
 Well, it's a true story.
It was about having no regrets,
and hey, you've got to take a
big risk to get a big return.
 PROBST: You gave up a lot,
though.
You literally left your job,
the car, the insurance, the gas.
 I did.
I had to quit my job to do it.
So I gave up a wonderful job,
not just a wonderful job, but
it was one that I loved so much.
So, yeah, I gave up a company
car.
That means gas and insurance,
health insurance.
So there was a lot to... a lot
at risk for me.
 PROBST: Besides the obvious
now that you have a million
dollars that will be in your
bank account tomorrow, what's
the impact on your life?
Because this is...
To undergo this kind of
adventure that you guys do,
you're tested on so many levels.
Did it change you?
 Absolutely.
It's a very humbling experience.
Um, I think anybody up here
could say you really realize
want versus need, uh, and it...
 PROBST: Meaning what?
 Well, you know, when you
think you need the razor to
shave, you really don't need a
razor to survive.
So it really puts in perspective
want versus need, so...
 PROBST: Key move in the game.
What's the key move you made?
 The key move I made for sure,
hands down-- Erik, I'm sorry--
but it was getting Erik ousted,
so...
 PROBST: If you don't get Erik
out, what happens?
 Um, if Erik would not have
gotten eliminated, um, I believe
that it would have been Jaison
going home, and then our numbers
would have been down to three,
and it would have just been one
by one.
 PROBST: Now, tell me about
your relationship with
Russell.
How did that work?
 Wow! Okay, well, Russell
pretty much, um...
We were a team.
We would bounce things back and
forth off of each other.
Uh, Russell, uh, did...
I would say he took the bullets.
Hands on.
And I would be the one behind,
even though I was doing the same
type thing, I was a lot more
subtle than Russell was.
 PROBST: So do you think you
played a different social game,
and that's...?
 Absolutely. Absolutely.
 PROBST: Was that the
difference?
 I think so.
 PROBST: Russell, do you agree
with that?
Was that the difference?
 First of all, I don't agree
with her key move in the game.
Her key move in the game was
aligning with me.
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: And we're off and
running.
 Okay, maybe I had two key
moves then.
 PROBST: But do you agree that
this game does come down to
getting a vote?
Did Natalie have a better social
game?
 You don't think I had a good
social game?
(laughter)
I had Jaison.
I had Mick, Natalie, Shambo.
They trusted me.
That's why they stayed with me.
That sounds like a pretty damn
good social game to me.
 PROBST: You-You look visibly
upset right now.
 Yeah, I mean, I feel like
that I played the best strategic
game in history.
I think that...
(applause and cheering)
And I'm not the only one that
thinks that.
I can guarantee you, millions
of people probably think that
same thing, but you know...
 AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes!
(cheers)
 And Natalie-- her best move
was to jump on my back.
 PROBST: Different question.
Did you bring the wrong people
to the final?
What if you had brought Jaison
and Shambo?
 That's...
That's a question I think about
all the time.
Should I have brought Jaison
and Shambo?
 PROBST: Let's poll the jury
and include Mick and Natalie on
the jury now.
 Right.
 PROBST: Now that you guys
that are on the jury, you've got
Mick, Natalie, and everybody
else, and it's-it's Jaison and
Shambo.
Does Russell win the game?
Jury?
No?
Some yeses.
Give me a show of hands.
Let's go. How many people vote
for Russell?
There's four.
 No?
 Nah.
 PROBST: How many people vote
for Shambo.
 You would vote for me.
 PROBST: There's two.
How many vote for Jaison?
There's one.
Russell, you made the wrong
choice.
 Oh!
(laughter)
 PROBST: While you were
talking to Natalie, we just
held an impromptu vote.
You had four votes.
That would have been enough.
Keep you up at night?
 That sucks.
(laughter)
You know... You know, the thing
is, it's... it... I...
First of all, I have a question
I want to ask Natalie.
 PROBST: Okay.
 Natalie, all I want is the
title of sole survivor.
(laughter)
I will pay you $10,000 for the
title.
If Jeff says, "Russell, you are
the sole survivor," and I get
it in paper written down that I
am the sole survivor...
(cheering and applause)
...I will retire.
 Take it. Take it.
 PROBST: Well, now...
 Take the money.
 PROBST: All right, Natalie,
first, he's asking you...
Are you asking Natalie to say to
you you're a better player?
 No, I'm asking her to ask you
to tell me that I'm the sole
survivor.
(laughter and applause)
 PROBST: So, you-you can just
ask me directly.
You want me to say that you're
the best player.
 I'll...
 PROBST: It brings up an
interesting question.
Erik, give me some perspective
on this.
 Cardona!
 Thanks.
(laughter)
 PROBST: Erik, here's the
question.
It's really interesting, because
in the confines and the context
of this game, Natalie won.
She figured out, you could
argue, she figured out, "My best
move, go next to the bruiser,
let him take the bullets.
They won't like him.
They'll like me."
That is a strategy that is
legitimate in this game.
She's got the million bucks.
Fair enough.
(cheering)
So no disrespect to you.
Russell's argument is, nobody
played like I played this
season, which I would agree--
nobody.
Russell dominated the game with
big, bold moves, found idols
when there weren't clues, all
sorts of things.
(applause and cheering)
So is it possible to not win the
game and be the better player?
Or is that impossible in
Survivor?
You have to win.
 I think for the first time
in my life in any competition,
anything, uh, my entire life,
this game truly, winning is
arbitrary.
And they say clich√©s like, "It's
not whether you win or lose.
It's how you play the game."
I always thought that was B.S.
that losers said, you know,
but...
 PROBST: So what are you
saying?
 I'm saying, you don't...
 PROBST: Did Russell play a
better game?
 Than Natalie?
 No.
 I don't value his strategy
more than hers.
I don't value hers more than
his.
 PROBST: Jaison, quick comment
on social politics.
Because still, as we sit here,
the audience overwhelmingly
says, yes, Russell played the
better game.
(cheering and applause)
The people who played with him
say he did not.
What did you learn about the
importance of perception and
social politics?
 Uh, well, I think that this
game is a lot like real life.
I mean, everyone works in an
office, uh, on a team, working
on projects, like our
challenges, trying to get
individual distinctions so that
they can move forward, while at
the same time winning the games
and the challenges.
And I think everyone who works
in an office also has a Russell
there who says, "I didn't come
to work.
I came to play."
And I think it's interesting
that people really seem to be
valuing, um, his-his-his
negative contributions over, you
know, someone like Natalie,
who's-who's trying to be more
positive and moral and whatever,
so, for me, Natalie played the
better game.
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: Equal round of
applause, I got to say.
 And... so-so it's interesting
to me that people...
People hate Russell in real
life.
They go to work every day and
go, "I hate that guy!"
(applause and cheering)
But then you come on Survivor,
and all of a sudden, all the
backstabbing and pouring out
water and burning socks is game
play?
I mean, what is that?
So that's-that's...
I just think it's wrong.
 Jaison is still bitter for
me burning his socks.
Are you kidding me?
He is...
You know what Jaison?
I got something for you.
(laughter)
 Thank you, Russell.
 You know what?
 Thank you.
 Never mind.
I'll burn them, too.
(applause and cheering)
 That's what I've got for you.
 Well, she's got your check!
And that's why she got the
check!
 PROBST: All right, while
these guys work out the sock
issue, we're going to go to
break.
Still to come, I'm sure we will,
uh, hear a lot more from
Russell.
And up next, the woman with the
scariest hairstyle, Shambo, and
the man who lived through the
scariest moment, Russell Swan.
It's the Survivor: Samoa Live
Reunion Show.
We'll be right back.
Survivors ready?
Go!
(overlapping chatter)
Big collision right off the bat.
Oh!
This is gonna be physical.
(groaning)
Oh!
Some skin coming off on that
one.
(indistinct chatter)
 Left, left, left.
To your left! Left! Left!
 PROBST: Stop!
 Are you all right?
(panting)
 PROBST: Who do you think is
the smartest?
 I'm choosing Shambo.
 Oh, my God!
 Oh!
 911.
I didn't know they could fly.
(imitating chicken)
 There have been times when I
just want to go, "Did your mom
drop you on your head?"
(Shambo clucking)
 PROBST: What do you call
that hair, Shambo?
 Shambolicious, baby.
 The mullet went out in the
'70s.
It looks terrible.
 People have gravitated to me
my entire life.
It's, like, "Oh, my God, this
chick rocks.
We love her."
(laughing)
(cheering)
(band plays upbeat music)
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion
Show.
Shambo, I'm guessing-- I mean,
even the way you're dressed
now-- it's hard to miss you.
Are you getting a big reaction
from people?
 I'm getting a really positive
reaction in Seattle.
It's pretty overwhelming.
And it's-it's-it's an honor.
It's-It's absolutely awesome,
because it gives me a venue to
just lambaste positive, hugely,
in my area that love, that I
grew up in, that's beautiful,
and touch a lot of kids' lives.
And I'm just going to go for it
and ride the wave.
(cheering and applause)
 PROBST: So you get a lot of
kids who relate to you.
I know my nieces are crazy about
you and your crazy way and your
hair.
Is that the biggest response
from young-young people?
 It's kind of across the
board.
I mean, it's-it's insane.
I have elderly-- I mean,
80-plus-year-old people.
It's-It's not gender-defined.
It's not age-defined.
It's really across the board.
I-I don't really get it.
But it's-it's...
Some days I can't do my job
because I'm going in and out of
restaurants or day cares or, you
know, casinos, and I'm, like,
dipping in the back door now,
going, "Hey, dude, can you go
get the manager?
I can't go into the dining room
'cause it's going to be on."
"Here, talk to my mom!"
(laughter)
 PROBST: Tell me about the
hair.
How many years have you had this
hairstyle?
 Well, I think I started
growing it out length-wise...
(laughter)
 PROBST: Oh, there we go.
We've got a shot right next to
you.
What-What year is that?
 Oh, dear God.
(laughter)
 PROBST: What year is that?
 That's, uh... that's in
Okinawa, Japan, playing Marine
Corps softball, right there,
1986.
 PROBST: '86. Wow. 23 years?
 Well, it started in '84.
 PROBST: Okay.
(laughter)
Tell me about your relationship
with Laura.
One of the other interesting
things about Survivor is that
you get dropped into this
extreme... this situation of
extreme conflict with people
that you might normally not even
want to talk to, let alone rely
on.
What was it about you two?
Was it just friction from the
beginning?
That's how you are?
 Laura! Yeah!
(cheering)
 You know, I don't even think
it was friction.
I think that Laura and I are
both two incredibly independent,
strong women in our own lives,
and I think we kind of rule our
roost, and I think on day one,
we kind of did the... (clucks).
And we walked away from each
other.
(laughter)
 PROBST: Laura... Laura what's
your take on it?
Because it was one of the most
talked about relationships this
season is you two.
 Yeah, you know what?
Like Shambo said, we both have
our own, um, interpretation of
what happened.
I don't specifically recall
doing the... (imitates clucking)
...with Shambo.
But you know what?
Um, so many things could have
transpired from that.
I think that there was a threat
because when the tribe would say
who's the strongest woman, they
would say Laura, and, you know,
Shambo being the marine and I
being the grandma, and that's
who's the strongest one?
We're going to go with granny?
I think that's probably kind of
hard to hear.
And, um, I loved the girls on my
tribes.
They reminded me of my daughter,
so there was that bond.
I just think there was just so
many different elements that
played into it.
 PROBST: What's the status
today-- are you guys talking,
not talking?
Ever going to talk again?
 Um, no. We've-We've exchanged
a few messages, but look it,
um...
 PROBST: Wow. That said
everything, Laura.
That said it all.
 You know...
 PROBST: So, that relationship
is just not one that's probably
gonna bloom a long-term...
 Look, Jeff, let me just say
this.
There's been forgiveness that's
been given.
Um, whether a relationship will
continue after that, honestly,
probably not, but the biggest
thing is that there was
forgiveness on both sides, and
we're both gonna go our own
ways.
 PROBST: That sounds good.
(applause and cheering)
Dave?
Dave, does it surprise you how
quickly you can form bonds that
in many cases do last years and
years and years, like a family,
in a way?
 Uh, it's pretty shocking.
I-I found that coming out, I
really felt like I had a new
family.
It was just...
I mean, in addition to my
amazing family, also, as well.
(cheering)
(laughter)
Uh, but, you know, I...
You know, Brett, Lolo, Kelly--
I'd do anything for them.
I mean, they're tough, they're
tough competitors, they're great
human beings, and they mean the
world to me.
It's really...
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: Brett, I got to ask.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: A carnival game
thought up in a field somewhere
in Samoa cost you a million
dollars.
 Yeah, I mean, walking into
that challenge, I'm, like,
"This is a carnival game for one
million dollars."
And, you know, holding this
little figurine on this stick,
just hoping that mine stays
there till the end.
'Cause I knew, like, when...
Immediately when that thing
falls, I'm done.
And if anyone can ever
experience that level of
pressure in their life, you
know, best of luck to you.
But that was probably, probably
the most stressful thing I've
ever done, and, you know, fate
took its course, I guess.
 PROBST: Because there...
I mean, it's kind of...
We can... We can do this just
for the sake of doing it.
There's no question with Galu
on the jury, right...?
Jury, show the hands.
Brett wins if he's in the final.
 Oh, yeah.
 PROBST: Okay. So, it's got...
You've got to roll this.
When you watched it back and
saw that...
I mean, when you saw it just now
for the first time tonight...
 Mm-hmm, yeah.
 PROBST: ...did you relive
that?
 Oh, yeah, I relived it.
It was... It was sad.
It was very tough, coming all
the way to the end, being one of
the final four people, and to
have your fate determined by a
figurine falling over.
I mean, it is one for my
memoirs, I guess.
But, you know, it's-it's a tough
thing, but you know, that is
life, and you know, you got to
move on.
 PROBST: All right.
Well, in addition to some
tumultuous personal
relationships, this year also
had its share of physical
hardships.
One of the scariest moments in
the history of our show came on
day 15.
Take a look.
Russell still struggling to get
to the finish.
 Russell.
 Russell...
 I want the ball to go down
to...
 PROBST: Everybody hold up.
Medical.
 Lie him down.
 Russ, are you okay?
Talk to me.
Russ, are you with us?
Russell? Russell?
Russell, can you hear me?
 PROBST: Russell.
(applause and cheering)
We're glad you're here, man.
 I'm glad to be here, Jeff,
definitely.
 PROBST: Let's-Let's go back,
because you didn't know how bad
it was when you were out there.
 No, absolutely not.
I mean, I had no idea.
In fact, I was quite livid with
you...
 PROBST: Yup.
 I mean, you're a nice guy and
all that, Jeff, but I mean, you
know, you said I'm done, and I
couldn't believe it.
I had no idea I was that bad.
I thought I was still good to
go.
I still wanted to compete.
And next thing I know, I'm out.
And I didn't know until I
actually watched the episode
how bad I was.
 PROBST: And what was that?
You're at home with your wife,
Caroline, right?
 Yes.
 PROBST: And you're watching
this, and you don't know what
you're about to see, which is,
you were close to being gone.
 No, right.
I mean, I had no idea.
I mean, and I felt so bad.
Because normally, I would warn
my wife.
I mean, I love her to death.
I wouldn't want to, you know...
to have her see something that
shocking, and I had no idea.
So we're sitting there watching
it, and all of a sudden, you
know, the whole eyes thing goes,
and she loses it.
And she's, like, "You're dead!
You're dead!"
(laughter)
And I'm like, "No, I'm here."
"You're dead!"
"I'm here!"
"You're dead!"
So, we had a little argument
about whether or not I was dead,
which I found kind of
interesting, but...
(laughter)
Suffice it to say, I mean, I
just felt bad because it was...
it was that poignant.
 PROBST: Well, and you told
me later that it all made sense,
because you said, "You know
what?
There was a moment when..."
It sounds to me like you had a
near-death experience.
 Absolutely. I mean, there's
no doubt about it.
I have never felt that good in
my life.
I have never...
 PROBST: This is in the midst
of this trauma?
 This is in the midst of this.
The sky looked very blue and
wonderful.
I felt great.
I thought, "Man, this is...
I feel great.
I'm gonna, like, you know, take
this-this game, like, by storm."
Um, but, no, I was going, uh...
(laughs)
I was going heavenward.
Hopefully.
 PROBST: Well, we are glad
you're here, and thanks to our
medical team.
They were on...
They were taking care of you
the entire time.
(cheering and applause)
All right, still to come, Sprint
is going to award $100,000 to
one of this season's castaways
based on your votes.
And up next, he emptied his own
tribe mates' canteens.
He burned their socks.
He lied about being in
Hurricane Katrina.
And he found idols without
clues.
The only thing Russell didn't
do was win the game.
He's next.
We'll be right back.
(applause and cheering)
(band plays upbeat rock music)
 PROBST: Short strong guy,
what's your name?
 Russell.
I'm not here for the money.
I'm only here to show people
how easy it is to win this game.
I plan on making it as miserable
as possible.
I think if I can control how
they feel, I can control how
they think.
She's going first.
Whatever I want, happens.
I'm telling you the truth.
Are you telling me I'm not
honest?
You come up to me and threaten
me, you got to go.
 What's he doing in there?
 I'm looking for the immunity
idol.
How many people found the idol
without a clue?
Boo-ya.
That easy.
Oh, my God.
I ain't finished playing just
yet.
 PROBST: Russell, grunting it
out!
Russell has Brett!
Russell wins the final
individual immunity challenge.
 I said from day one, I was
gonna get here.
I was born for this.
This is what God made me for.
(cheering)
 PROBST: We're gonna settle
that.
(band plays upbeat rock music)
Welcome back to the Survivor:
Samoa Live Reunion Show.
Russell, Russell, Russell.
First, let's pick up.
What did we decide about the
$10,000 offer?
 That's up to her.
 I'm going to decline
Russell's offer.
 Good job.
 Yeah!
 In order...
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: All right, so you're
not interested in giving him
the title?
 I'm not interested.
In order to win the title of
sole survivor...
 I'll give you $100,000.
 No, it's priceless.
You have to get majority of the
votes of the jury, so...
 PROBST: Wow! Let me just
say, let me just point this out.
There are two words up for
debate-- sole survivor.
$100,000 just turned down for
those two words.
You're all crazy.
(laughter)
All right, Russell.
I would have taken that money.
I'll call you sole survivor for
100 grand the rest of your life.
What's been the reaction on the
street to you?
Because you're one of the most
polarizing players we've ever
had on the show.
(applause and cheering)
 Right, it's crazy, because,
uh, at first, people hated me.
You know, I might have been the
most hated of all times.
Now it seems like millions of
people love me for...
I don't know how that happened,
but it happened.
 Russell!
 And, uh, it's just...
It's weird.
 PROBST: What's the reaction
from kids to you?
Do they like you, generally?
 Well, my...
I have twin girls.
They're nine, in the fourth
grade, and, uh, their whole
school loves me.
(laughter and cheering)
 PROBST: One of the... one of
the things that got talked about
this season that completely
surprised us from a producing
point of view was you finding
idols without the clues.
 Yeah!
(cheering)
 PROBST: Where did that...?
It now seems like a very simple
idea that, why not just go
looking for clues?
Where did that idea come from?
 I just...
I was playing the game so hard,
I was so focused, I just thought
that they had to have an idol
somewhere.
And I looked for a long time.
It just... it doesn't seem like
I do, but I looked for a long
time for all of them.
And, uh, just kept looking
until I found... you know, until
I found it.
 PROBST: Did we create a
monster in you?
I mean, you're really into
Survivor, aren't you?
 This is serious.
I take the game very, very
serious, and I think that
every...
I thought that I won the game
for sure because I thought
everybody took it so serious,
but, obviously, not.
 PROBST: You made a comment
out there, uh-- "your dumb-ass
girl alliance."
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm.
 PROBST: And you just talked
about having two girls and a
wife.
You have three women in your
family.
What...? A lot of pe...
 I have four women.
 PROBST: Four women.
 My mom, too.
(laughter)
 PROBST: So a lot of women
were offended by that comment.
Any regrets on it?
 There's no regrets how I
played the game.
I don't regret anything that I
did.
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: Because, I mean,
leave it to me to say, one of
those dumb-ass girls beat your
ass for a million dollars.
 Yeah.
(applause and cheering)
Let's go out here for a minute.
I want to say hello and answer
a question I think a lot of
people have... is this
question.
Who marries Russell?
(laughter)
Melanie, you're Russell's wife?
 Yes. Well...
 PROBST: What is it about
this guy that, uh, made you say
yes?
 Well, like you even said,
Jeff, he's very charming.
And believe it or not, I mean,
no matter all the negative
things he's done on the show,
he's actually a great guy and
a great father.
And I love him.
 Oh.
(applause and cheering)
 PROBST: All right, up next,
one of these players up here is
going to win $100,000 courtesy
of Sprint.
But first, bringing us to break,
our composers David Vanacore
and Russ Landau.
(cheering)
(band plays upbeat music)
 PROBST: A big battle on the
ground.
Ben, stop!
Ben out of the challenge!
(whooping)
The first time in the history
of Survivor, somebody's been
pulled out of a challenge.
You're done.
 Outlaw, baby.
(applause and cheering)
(band plays upbeat music)
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion
Show.
Ben, just so I can feel safe
going home tonight, are you and
I okay?
 We're cool, buddy.
 PROBST: Okay.
All right, well since Thursday,
viewers have been texting and
voting online for the Sprint
Player Of the Season.
The votes are in, and we're
going to now award the $100,000.
Here are the three top
vote-getters, in no particular
order.
Russell. Evil Russell.
(cheering)
Shambo.
(cheering)
The underdog.
And Brett.
(cheering)
 PROBST: Brett, it is not you.
 Oh!
 PROBST: Brett is out.
We are down to two.
Russell and Shambo.
The winner of the Sprint Player
of the Season award and the
$100,000 goes to Russell.
(cheers and applause)
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
Mick.
Mick, you just shook Russell's
hand.
What do you make of this?
You're a smart guy.
The audience just voted the
player of the season, Russell.
Natalie wasn't in the top three.
 I mean, you can't argue
with--
 PROBST: How do you make this
mix of two different things
going on?
 It's hard.
It's hard to reconcile the fact
that, like, you know, he was
the bad guy, but he played like
nobody else played.
Like he said, finding idols.
He did mastermind a lot of this
stuff, and so I mean you can't
argue that.
It was fantastic.
It was great to watch.
 PROBST: I want to do a
couple of quick updates and see
how people are doing.
Mike Borassi, you also were
evacuated from this game,
fortunately not as serious as
Russell's.
How are you doing?
 Good, and I didn't cry on
camera either, so...
 PROBST: Wow.
There is no mercy here.
 I'm just kidding.
No, I'm fine.
 PROBST: And you've lost a
lot of weight, I can tell.
 Yeah, I lost about 65 pounds.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: Ashley, I was touched
to hear that this experience
for you actually brought you a
lot closer to your father.
 Yes. That's very...
--  PROBST: Why is that?
 That's true.
We always watch every season
together, and then me getting
on the show was just one of the
best experiences.
We watch it every week and we
have our favorites and it's
just really great to be even
closer to him.
 PROBST: Monica, you kind of
slid through this game and you
were actually, you know, at one
point Russell said, "Had Monica
and I met early or day one, we
would have been the powerhouse."
This experience for you, more
than you bargained for?
 I think it was an amazing
experience.
It was an awesome growth
opportunity.
And, I mean, it was a great
journey.
I learned tons about myself,
and I don't regret anything.
 PROBST: Yasmin, you,
coincidentally, are sitting
next to the guy that you really
didn't get along with too well
out there.
 Yes, I am.
Yeah, you know what?
I came here expecting to have a
problem with Ben but when I
think of my childhood and my
wonderful parents, I know that
I was raised to forgive.
Definitely not to forget, but I
forgive Ben for all the things
that he said. I do.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: Betsy.
I have to say, probably more
than anybody else this season,
people said to me, "Wow, I
really wish she hadn't have
been voted out so early.
I really missed her."
 Aw, me, too.
 PROBST: How did your kids
take-- you have a big family.
How did they take watching you
out there, watching Mom go
through this.
 I have four kids, Ben, Tim,
Molly and Meg.
Yeah!
They're proud of me.
And we get a kick out of it,
so-- and I loved it.
Jeff, you make me sweat every
time you say my name!
(laughter)
Look at me sweat.
 PROBST: Marisa, you know,
Russell made a comment about
the fact that the two people
that worried him the most, you
and Betsy, had to go one-two.
Looking back on it, did you
overplay your hand a little bit
to the wrong guy, being too
aggressive?
 You know what?
I am a strong girl.
I wouldn't have done it
differently.
He's damn right.
If I would've been out there I
would've gotten rid of him
immediately.
 PROBST: All right, well, it
is one of the most-anticipated
seasons we have ever done.
I'm talking about Survivor
number 20.
We will tell you all about it
when we come back.
(cheers and applause)
(thunder crashing)
Well, I don't know if Mother
Nature is sending you a sign or
not, but there's a big cloud
over your head right now.
 Welcome to Samoa, brother.
The rain doesn't stop.
 I'm so freaking cold right
now.
I have never been this cold,
had my hands destroyed and my
feet look so miserable.
This is the man test.
 PROBST: This has been 15 of
the toughest days I've seen any
group go through.
 Dear God, please, please let
the sun shine.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: Well, for 19 seasons,
Survivor has brought you
adventures from all over the
world and changed the face of
television.
In fact, Daily Variety just
yesterday declared Survivor the
most influential program of the
decade.
You, our loyal fans are a big
part of the reason we're still
going strong after 19 seasons
and to commemorate our 20th
season we hope you enjoy what
we have in store for you.
Take a look.
For the last ten years and 19
seasons, Survivor has taken you
to some of the most stunning
locations around the planet.
And introduced unforgettable
personalities.
 I feel we owe it to this
island spirits to let it be in
the end the way Mother Nature
intended it to be, for the
snake to eat the rat.
 He's burned, he's burned
pretty bad there.
 Look at these things.
 It is either going to be my
buddy or grandmother coming.
My grandmother is not here for
a reason.
 Meet Dragon Slayer.
Ahh!
Victory is mine.
 I want to give individual
immunity to Natalie.
 I have lost my ring to the
dumbest survivor ever.
 I ain't finished playing
just yet.
 PROBST: The winner of the
first Survivor competition is...
Rich.
And in the process, forever
changed the face of television.
Now, deep in the South Pacific,
20 of Survivor's greatest
castaways return, and a
conflict will ignite.
One side chosen for their
skills in deception,
manipulation, and duplicity:
the villains.
And the other, defined by their
decisions of integrity,
courage, and honor: the heroes.
20 castaways will return
seeking revenge, or redemption,
in the biggest battle in
Survivor history.
Find out who will face off
against each other this Spring
for the title of sole survivor
and the million-dollar prize.
In Survivor: Heroes vs.
Villains.
(cheers and applause)
Mark it down, February 11 is
when the new season premieres on
CBS.
Tomorrow morning, Natalie will
be on the Early Show and will
get a check for a million
dollars.
If you want to own a piece of
Survivor, you can bid on props
from this season as well as
some great experience packages.
All proceeds benefit the
Serpentine Project, which is my
charity, working with former
foster care youth to help their
dreams come true.
The Web site's on the screen
now.
The auction begins immediately
and runs through December 30.
Finally, if you want to be on
As always, thank you for your
support.
We will see you in February for
Survivor: Heroes vs.
Villains.
Happy holidays.
