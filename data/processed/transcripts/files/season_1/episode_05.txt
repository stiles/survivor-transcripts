         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans forced 
 to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China sea... 
Marooned for 39 days, 
 they must work together 
to build shelter, find food 
 and survive the island 
but, ultimately, 
 it is everyone for themselves. 
Every third night 
they will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council 
where they must vote 
 one of their own 
off the island. 
In the end, 
 only one will remain, 








and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
( primal call echoing ) 
Last week on Survivor... 
( thunder crashing ) 
RAMONA: 
 It was the worst night 
I've ever slept. 
Gretchen decided 
she wouldn't sleep 
 one more night 
in their poorly constructed 
 shelter. 
I don't want to sleep 
 in that anymore. 
I don't want to
 be antisocial 
but I'm going 
in the woods. 
JEFF: 
 Ramona felt like an outcast 








and wanted to redeem herself. 
Want to play rough, huh? 
JENNA: 
 She's trying, 
 but I think maybe it is 
a little too little too late. 
JEFF: 
 At Tagi tribe, Sue continued 
 her quest to find more food... 
Tapioca. Tapioca's supposed 
 to have red lines and... 
Got to find the tapioca. 
While Sean worked 
 on other island necessities. 
SEAN: 
 I had this vision. 
I thought I'd build myself 
 a bowling alley 
right about here. 
SUSAN: 
 Sean sits there for five hours 
and builds his bowling alley. 
I'm tired of feeding people 
 that don't do anything. 
My parents would be so proud. 
JEFF: 
 A cunning plan was hatched 
 by Sue, Kelly and Rich. 
RICH: 
 So, the, um... 
alliances have begun. 
The whole point 
 of forming an alliance is so 
we're all going to vote 
 the same way. 
JEFF: 
 Tagi was on a roll. 
They won 
 the reward challenge... 
Go get it. 
And, then... 
the Immunity Challenge. 
( cheering ) 
So, a distraught Pagong tribe 
had to return 
 to Tribal Council. 
GERVASE: 
 The most difficult thing for me
was to vote somebody off. 
JEFF: 
 And even though Ramona 
had been working 
 harder than ever, 
she was still voted off. 
Last vote: Ramona.
The tribe 
 has spoken.
12 people left. 
Who will be voted off next? 
( primal chanting ) 
( birds chirping ) 
COLLEEN: 
 We slept late 
 for the first time 
since we've been here today. 
Everybody's a little bit 
 on edge. 
Everybody's 
 a little vulnerable today. 
( insects buzzing ) 
JOEL: 
 I think today 
 we're just a little bit down 
because another person's gone, 
 of course, 
and we can see 
 that the group's getting 
a little bit smaller. 
Even if it's 
 only two people smaller, 
it's still getting 
 a little bit smaller 
and, uh, and we're starting 
 to see that a little bit. 
JENNA: 
 For some reason, 
the last two to three days 
 we've just been really down. 
I think it's got a lot to do 
 with just, uh, 
we lost two in a row. 
We lost a member of the group 
 and one of... 
who I consider 
 one of our male leaders, Greg, 
was really feeling terrible. 
He's got an ear infection. 
He's really sick. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I think the camp looks trashy. 
I think stuff's 
 all over the place. 
I think the flag should be up. 
I mean, 
 there's a lot we could do 
to make 
 this camp look really nice. 
I mean, something's going 
 to have to change. 
Something's going to have 
 to happen 
to make everybody decide 
 to pitch in. 
Welcome to the big top, 
 ladies and gentlemen. 
RUDY: 
 That is the parachute 
that they dropped 
 the cargo with the other day 
that, uh, 
 contained some goodies 
and, uh, right now, they want 
to hang the parachute up 
 for shade. 
KELLY: 
 Me, personally, 
 I was a little irritated 
with, um, Sean and Dirk's effort
 around camp. 
I mean, 
they try to go fishing 
when they know they're 
 not going to catch anything 
and I think, personally, 
 it's just so they can say, 
"Hey, well, we did something." 
Kelly thinks that failure 
to catch fish is failure to try.
You know, I think she's equating
 those two, which is not true. 
Right now we 
could be working... 
driving through 
rush hour traffic. 
Yep. 
Fighting bills 
and trying 
to get dates. 
Instead we're just chilling 
on the South China sea. 
SEAN: 
 The fish are not biting 
 hooks out here for some reason.
Either we got the wrong bait, or
 we're going at the wrong time. 
Fishing with a hook, I think, 
 is useless. 
They put about 25 hours in 
and not a bite. 
That's a big enough hint for me 
not to go fishing with a hook. 
You guys getting 
anything? 
SEAN: 
Not even a nibble. 
It's our 
 day off, brother. 
SUSAN: 
 I'm just irritated 
 with Sean and Dirk 
going out and wasting 
 three days 
in the daylight fishing. 
And I let them know, too. 
During the day, you should 
 go out in the woods 
looking for tapioca 
and fish at night. 
You guys wasted 
three days fishing 
 during the day. 
DIRK: 
 I don't think 
 it was a waste.
Well, did you catch 
 anything? 
No, ma'am.
Okay. 
It was a waste of time then. 
SEAN: 
 It's expected to get on 
 each other's nerves. 
Maybe everyone's 
 on my nerves, too, 
but I just 
 don't really act on it. 
I just wanted to be happy-- 
have a nice life here 
 and that's it. 
KELLY: 
 It's been the people who really
 work and contribute to camp 
versus the people 
 who are lazy 
and don't really do anything 
to contribute to the camp. 
The second I stop having fun 
I'll vote myself off the island.
I came here 
 to have a great time, 
grow in my faith 
with the Lord 
and that's the most important 
 thing to me. 
RUDY: 
 It's funny to me that a guy 
 would read the Bible out here. 
The only reason 
I'd bring a Bible is if... 
I mean, I'm religious too... 
if I needed toilet paper. 
Come on over, guys. 
I bring news 
 of tomorrow's challenge. 
Right here. 
"First Annual 
"Weapons Target 
Shooting Classic. 
The battle in Borneo." 
Now, it's 
a reward challenge, 
so you'll be competing 
against the other tribe 
for something I have 
a feeling you 
all want-- food. 
So here's 
the deal. 
It'll be three rounds. 
First round is 
a blowgun. 
Five darts. 
Second round-- 
 a mighty slingshot 
and the third round, 
 spear tossing. 
So you'll pick one person 
 for each event. 
So only three people 
 will participate. 
And I'm coming to bring these 
 so you can practice. 
Yeah! 
 I love it. 
SEAN: 
 We had a little visit 
from Jeff, our host, today, 
and he came by and told us 
 that tomorrow's going 
to be a competition-- 
 a reward challenge. 
So we've been practicing 
 all day at that. 
( laughing ) 
( cheering ) 
Right in the coconut. 
That wasn't too bad. 
Turns out that I'm pretty good 
with the blowgun. 
 And I never really... 
never shot a blowgun before 
 in my life. 
Dead on. Good. 
Turns out Rich is 
 an expert marksman. 
Something 
 we didn't know about him 
until today, so, uh... 
He has excellent aim 
when it comes to a slingshot. 
No worries. 
Yeah, I think he's 
slingshot boy. 
And Sue throws that spear 
much better than any 
of the guys in our tribe. 
She's a wild woman 
 with the spear. 
I always wanted to kill a pig 
with a javelin... with a spear. 
And I was kind of hoping 
 that I'd be good at nothing 
so that I could just, 
 like, hang back 
and let the pressure go 
 on somebody else. 
Turns out I throw 
 the javelin the best. 
I'm thinking the other team's 
 going to have a guy 
throwing the spear. 
So if there is, 
 there's a good chance 
that I can dog some guy 
 on national TV. 
Cool. 
No matter who 
 they put up, 
 you got it. 
SUE: 
 Even if we lost 
and I at least dogged the guy 
 in the spear throwing, 
they'd be happy. 
GERVASE: 
Next up, out of Green Bay, 
weighing in at 2... 
excuse me, 
he lost 20 pounds. 180. 
Big country 
 all-American, 
the world's strongest man!
( quacking ) 
I never really threw 
 a spear in my life. 
Except, you know... 
 anything serious. 
It's kind of hard 
 to keep it straight. 
That's a good distance, 
especially a little thing 
 like this, 
and you don't know if you can 
 take a running start 
or how you should do it, 
 or what the thing is, so 
this looks like it's going to be
 our weakest event for sure. 
Because the other girls have 
 the blowguns down really well. 
The slingshot looks good. 
So it would be nice 
 to win it today. 
A lot of these reward challenges
 we haven't really been after, 
but I think we're all really 
 determined for this one. 
Looks good. 
( cheering ) 
Welcome to the First Annual 
 Survivor Weapons Challenge, 
otherwise known 
 as The Battle in Borneo. 
It's three rounds-- 
first round is blow darts. 
You guys have selected 
 your blow dart shooters? 
All right, 
 you guys'll have ten darts. 
Go ahead 
 and take your shot here. 
Tagi, over here; 
Pagong over here to watch. 
Any of the fruit you 
 hit goes into a basket
that we carry over
to the next round.
Chinese melon!
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Last shot.
Good round, guys. 
Head over 
to the slingshot area. 
I'll collect your fruit. 
Hey, good 
 work, buddy.
JEFF: 
 All right, it's a time trial. 
Let's have the two slingshotters
 come up. 
Come on, Gretchen! 
Come on, baby,
 come on, now! 
JEFF: 
 Here are the rules 
 for this round: 
If you knock the fruit off, 
if you break the vase 
or if you embed a rock 
 in the fruit 
it goes into the fruit basket. 
You have two minutes 
to hit as many of the items 
 as you can. 
( cheering ) 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
All right, 
round three... 
spear throwing, 
and this is where 
it gets very interesting. 
This is 
a winner-take-all event. 
The single spear
 that is closest 
to the bull's-eye 
 when it's over 
gets the basket
 of fruit 
and a very special food source--
 a mystery food source. 
Who are your two spear throwers?
Step up, mate. 
This box is 
 for shooters only. 
You each get 
three tosses. 
Susan, you're up. 
Good shot! 
Nice shot! 
Come on, Joel,
 you can do it.
Come on, Joel.
( cheering ) 
 Nice, Joel! 
Good job! 
Good job! 
This is our closest right now. 
 Pagong. 
Nice shot! 
( all talking at once ) 
JEFF: 
Those are even right now. 
Come on, Joel. 
( loud cheering ) 
Nice! 
We want fruit! 
New mark to beat. 
Come on, Sue. 
JEFF: 
Last shot, Susan. 
Got to get inside that mark. 
Nice! 
( groaning and cheering ) 
JEFF: 
Victory for Pagong. 
Pagong, over here. 
Tagi... 
stay on your mat. 
Nice job, guys-- 
 you get all the fruit... 
Yes! Yes! 
And a very special 
mystery food prize.
Pizza?
 Apple?
Oh, snickers bars! 
 A chicken! 
Are you kidding? Oh!
( laughing ) 
Yes! 
 Yeah! 
Egg-laying chickens... 
and all the fruit-- 
 congratulations. 
Tagi, sorry. 
( chickens clucking ) 
Don't let them go. 
Yeah, that's going to happen. 
This is so awesome; 
 we got chickens. 
You guys going to 
 name these chickens?
Breakfast, 
 lunch and dinner. 
Breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
JENNA: 
 I don't know what brought 
 us down, but it seems like 
winning that challenge just 
brought everybody right back up.
I can't speak 
 for the rest of the tribe, 
but I really wanted to win 
 'cause it was food. 
I wanted to win that 
more than any 
 of the other rewards thus far. 
Unexpectedly, we came back 
 with three live chickens 
which was absolutely wonderful. 
Don't you dare. 
Uh... 
Whoo! 
JENNA: 
Aw, Gretchen! 
You're so mean. 
Mean, my ass. 
Well, we're going to see 
 if they produce any eggs, 
but I'm really thinking 
 that we're going to wait 
every other day 
 and eat a chicken. 
GRETCHEN: 
 They're not going 
 to be around long. 
Everybody's waiting 
 for them to lay eggs 
but I think 
 they're under a lot of stress 
and there's three of them 
 in that box 
and so they have 
 a very short time to produce 
before they're slaughtered. 
You could make
 a big omelet. 
That or we could just make 
fried rice with it. 
Oh, chicken fried rice?
Chicken fried rice. 
Oh, gross! Oh, my God!
JENNA: 
 Sorry, Breakfast, 
 Lunch and Dinner. 
GERVASE: 
 The fruit and the chickens 
 was just so huge 
to us, really, I mean... 
I think that's the biggest 
 reward so far to date. 
Fresh fruit. 
Ooh! 
( laughing ) 
( squeals ) 
( laughing ) 
GERVASE: 
 I think we were down 
 just because we lost. 
I mean, no matter how 
 you look at it, losing hurts 
and we had to vote 
 somebody off. 
So we just had to get out 
 of that, and then, when we won 
the reward challenge, that was 
 our momentum right there. 
SUSAN: 
 As far as losing 
 the challenge today, 
I was a little irritated. 
Here's my dream come true. 
I can stomp a guy 
 on national television 
and I miss by two inches. 
It was a bummer, but then 
when they pulled the chickens 
 out, I started laughing. 
Cutting off a chicken's head? 
No, it's not what I would want 
 to do for food. 
I can live without the chicken 
 right now. 
So that was all right. 
The other team won some 
 live chickens with some eggs. 
So we came back here 
and I went spearfishing 
 and got us a nice eel. 
That's the first eel. 
If I'd seen others, 
 I'd have gotten others. 
SUSAN: 
 Oh, wow.
It's all beautiful meat, 
 the whole thing. 
Nice job, Rich.
Is that pretty? 
It's so pretty.
That's a lot of meat. 
 That's a lot of meat, there.
It's all meat. 
Beats the hell 
 out of chicken.
KELLY: 
 I'd rather eat some eel 
 than some chicken. 
At least we eat stuff 
 that we go out and catch 
and look for ourselves, and 
 we don't have it handed to us. 
It might be a little overcooked.
It's meat. 
It's meat. 
RICHARD: 
Grab a piece. 
SUSAN: 
 Grab a piece and see 
 if you can rip it apart.
That's what it's
 going to take. 
RICHARD: 
It's cartilaginous, 
so chew on it. 
SEAN: 
 The eel was pretty horrible. 
Uh, it wasn't any good 
 whatsoever. 
KELLY: 
 We thought it was 
 just going to be 
you know, big, fat steaks 
 of meat, but it really wasn't. 
RUDY: 
 I wouldn't go 
 after eel again 
if I had a choice-- 
 I would have rather had 
chicken without a doubt. 
Wow. That's something. 
GRETCHEN: 
 My feelings 
on who the leader is 
 has always been Greg. 
He's just really good at it. 
I may be slipping into some sort
 of leadership position. 
I'm attempting to avoid it. 
I don't want to be 
 the leader of anything. 
I go play by myself, help out 
 the tribe as much as I can 
and try and recharge 
 my batteries 
so I can be there fully 
 with them. 
He's really good 
 at living in the woods, too. 
I think, out of everybody here,
Greg's the most comfortable 
 in the woods. 
GREG: 
 My psychological comfort 
 does not come 
from sleeping with the group 
 in a hut. 
In fact, 
 they kind of make me nervous, 
'cause there are 
 a lot of people doing 
a lot of different things 
and it's a lot of energy 
 in a very small space 
while I'm trying to clear 
 my head of energy. 
Sleeping in the forest 
 is comfortable 
for me. 
I'm making 
 a little sleeping pad. 
Sleeping pad, sleeping bag-- 
 depending on how big it gets. 
I just used some bedding 
 of debris 
or whatever I can find-- 
 palm or the leaves 
that are around-- 
 and pile up a bunch of debris. 
It's all a nesting instinct. 
As with everything, 
 make yourself a nest. 
I nest like a mama bird. 
Papa bird-- more like 
 a papa bird than a mama bird. 
A single... 
 like a bachelor bird, I guess. 
Colleen has joined me 
 in the forest to sleep. 
She apparently finds it 
 more comfortable, as well. 
I mean, they go off a lot, 
 seems like together. 
Like last night, for example, 
while everybody 
 was going to bed, 
they got out, 
 and nobody saw them 
till just this morning 
 sometime. 
JENNA: 
 I noticed they seem 
 to be spending their nights 
out under the stars 
 and cuddling up. 
I think it's stepped up 
 a notch-- 
maybe a little romance going on.
Um, when we go off, 
 it's all about sex. 
It's all that's happening. 
Um... 
it's a really passionate 
 affair right now. 
Things are going great. 
( laughing ) 
The question was asked before 
whether this was 
 a romantic situation or not, 
and I will reaffirm 
 that there is no romance. 
COLLEEN: 
 You know, 
he reminds me of my friends 
 back home, so it's like 
I can totally, totally 
 be myself with him. 
GREG: 
 So we like to play together-- 
not as a romantic situation, 
 but, yeah 
heading back out in the forest 
 and sleeping out there 
and the rest of it is great. 
RICHARD: 
 This is a yellow-banded 
 sea crate. 
We find a number of them 
 in the jungle. 
I haven't seen one 
 down here on the beach. 
I'm hoping 
 he goes for a swim. 
I might help him. 
He's awake now.
Oh, I'm not 
 afraid of snakes. 
I mean, 
I don't want to be bitten 
by something that's deadly, 
 but, no, I used to play 
with garter snakes, 
 when I was a kid 
and feed them frogs, and... 
You know, they're not... 
They are quick, and it's... 
 they can move fast, 
but you can see 
 when he's about to coil up 
and strike 
 and you can prepare yourself 
and you can get ready to move 
 before it does. 
I want to put him in the water 
'cause I want to watch him swim.
We've been told 
they're extremely deadly-- 
immediately deadly, 
 within six hours deadly. 
Horseflies bother me more. 
SEAN: 
 I knew today was going to be 
 a good day when I woke up. 
I haven't had a bowel movement 
 in nearly two weeks. 
This morning, I had my first 
bowel movement-- felt fantastic.
( cheering ) 
I am one 
of the bowel movers now. 
I'm getting thinner 
 and thinner. 
I think I'm using 
 most of the rice I make 
'cause I'm not bloated 
and my pants 
 are getting skinnier. 
Very excited about it-- 
 it's the way 
to start the day off, with a 
 little bit of a bowel movement.
Nice work, Sean. 
Go, New York, go. 
We were concerned about Dirk 
 and his eating a while ago, 
because he was really 
 disappearing into nothing. 
We're all losing a little 
 bit of weight, 
but Dirk was really losing 
 a lot of weight. 
DIRK: 
 I definitely lost 
 a lot of mass, 
a lot of muscle mass, 
 a lot of strength. 
It's not going to help me 
but, as long as I conserve 
 my energy-- 
don't waste it on things 
 that we don't need-- 
as long as I'm smart about it, 
 I think I'll be okay. 
KELLY: 
 We've noticed Dirk kind of 
getting a little skinny. 
Um, there was a few days 
where we were all 
 kind of concerned about him 
and, uh, he was just kind of...
I think, you know, mentally, 
 he was a little bummed out 
and all of us were, like, 
"eat more rice, eat more rice." 
DIRK: 
 We're going on 
 a tapioca hunt.
That way, 
 you can eat more, Dirk, 
'cause you're looking like hell.
You look like a nazi war 
 prisoner camp, dude. 
I don't look that bad.
Yeah, you do. 
Nazi war prisoner 
camp dude. 
Your Adam's apple's about out 
to the bottom of your chin. 
It usually is anyway. 
Yeah. Hell, my arm's 
as big as yours now. 
But it was before.
Well, we all kind of try 
 and keep an eye on him, 
'cause he was real skinny 
 to begin with. 
I'm doing the dishes; 
 I'm going out. 
We got that.
Anybody else? 
KELLY: 
 The labor thing, 
 it's actually better now. 
Sean and Dirk 
 started to realize 
that they better, you know, 
 do something. 
Otherwise, they're out of here. 
Want me to peel 
one of the big ones 
when you guys are done? 
Yeah. 
Is there another knife? 
SUSAN: 
 They've kind of come around 
 the last couple, 
two, three days 
 and started doing 
a little more, but it's 
 a little too late for that. 
Maybe I am on thin ice 
 with this team now. 
I don't know. 
I feel like 
 I'm pulling my weight 
and I think 
 the group sees that 
and I'm just going to find 
 tapioca, and I'm just going 
to let it work itself out. 
Where you going?
 For tapioca? 
SEAN: 
Yeah. 
KELLY: 
 You know what the, 
 uh, roots look like.
Yeah, yeah, I just showed Dirk. 
SUSAN: 
 And you know
what the trunks
 look like. 
Yeah. No, I just showed him 
the thing by the raft. 
RICHARD: 
 Kelly, Sue and I-- 
we need to decide cohesively 
 who we're going to reject 
and it's between Sean and Dirk,
 and Sean-- 
yesterday, he was talking 
about how he doesn't want 
to form an alliance 
because... 
Yeah. 
You know, 
"do unto others" and... 
What? You're 
in the midst of a game. 
 "...as others do unto you." 
It's just a game; 
 this is not real life.
So, we're thinking, 
"boy, Sean, it's time 
for you to go, bud." 
Tapioca's good eating, too. 
We definitely want a lot of it. 
I don't even know if I know 
 what I'm looking for. 
It's a distinctive 
 reddish root. 
Will I know when I find it? 
If we look further 
 along the trail, 
maybe we'll have better luck. 
I can't find any tapioca, man. 
I don't know where it is. 
SEAN: 
 Hermit crab crawling
 through the jungle. 
Look at the claws 
on that thing. 
They do make them big 
 here in the jungle. 
What about the tapioca?
They make any tapioca 
 big in this jungle? 
Not really. 
We still ain't
 found any. 
We're sucking at 
 this jungle thing.
SEAN: 
 There was about five 
 on this stem that I picked up 
but only one was good. 
The rest were mushy. 
So I had to throw the rest away.
It wasn't a 
 complete loss.
I think that we've 
 exhausted our supply. 
So that's the end 
of the tapioca, then? 
I think. I mean, 
you guys have better luck. 
You can go look, too. 
Rather an unsuccessful
 hunt for me and you. 
Yep. 
Maybe it's 
 you and me, man.
Maybe we're a bad team.
Probably. 
We're a fun team, though. 
Got our message. 
Check it out. 
"Selecting one's 
 always a chore, 
"so check your ego 
 at the door. 
"One to row, 
 the rest to swim. 
Make it fast, and 
 immunity you'll win." 
It's in the water.
 We got to win. 
KELLY: 
 Today's day 15 
and we have 
 an Immunity Challenge today. 
Hopefully, um, it'll be 
 something that, uh... 
that we can win pretty handily, 
 and I don't feel like going 
to the Immune Council tonight 
 by any means. 
I think we're 
 all swimming 
 except one rower. 
Gervase can't 
 swim, and he's 
 kind of gangly,
so I don't picture him
 rowing all that well. 
I don't know. 
 Maybe he can. 
I think we certainly
 have an edge up. 
Apparently, we need one rower 
 and the rest of us swimming, 
which is good, because we have 
 Kelly who's a rower. 
That's what she does 
 as a profession for a living. 
So it's your turn 
to shine, Kel. 
This is it. 
 Oh, boy. 
You've been waiting 
for this. 
Your time 
 to shine. 
KELLY: 
 I'm a commercial 
 white-water raft guide, 
so obviously, 
 I'm the rower today. 
Feeling a little pressure, but 
 I'm not too worried about it. 
I know Gervase can't swim, 
 so my guess 
is that they're going to put him
 in the boat rowing, 
which is cool for me 
because I can beat him 
 any day of the week. 
GERVASE: 
 "Selecting one 
 is always a chore 
"so check your ego at the door. 
"One to row, the rest to swim. 
Make it fast, 
and immunity you'll win." 
The decision that is obvious 
 is that Gervase should row. 
JENNA: 
 You can look at it 
 as a disadvantage 
that Gervase can't swim. 
But we all are going to have 
 our differences. 
Not all of us are going 
 to be strong at everything. 
Wow.
Swimming and rowing. 
I sent Gervase to row 
so he doesn't have to swim. 
But they'll guess that. 
They'll know that 
 that's what we're doing. 
Yeah, but I mean, 
what other choice do we have? 
We might not even get 
a life preserver. 
"Check your ego
 at the door." 
Comfort level with swimming's 
 about 80%. 
I mean, I've heard 
 you're more buoyant 
in the ocean, 
because of the salt water. 
I don't know that, though. 
To me, I'll sink 
 like I was in a pool. 
Maybe we have to build something
and the people who swim have 
to push it and one guy rows it. 
? Could be ?
? Who knows? ?
? There's something due 
 any day ? 
? I will know right away ? 
? Soon as it shows ? 
? It may come cannonballing 
 down through the sky ? 
? Gleam in its eye, 
 bright as a rose! ? 
? The air is humming ? 
? And something great 
 is coming ? 
( humming "Something's Coming" )
I can't wait! 
Who knows?! 
JEFF: 
 Today's Immunity Challenge 
is called "shipwrecked." 
Five members 
 from each tribe are stranded 
on items of floating debris 
simulating 
 a sunken ship disaster. 
The remaining two castaways 
 must rescue 
the members of their own tribe 
 by using outrigger canoes. 
Kelly was chosen 
 to row by Tagi 
and Gervase 
 was chosen by Pagong. 
Here's the premise. 
It's all on you guys. 
You're each going to be 
 in one of these canoes. 
You're going to swim out 
to the outside
 of your buoy--
yellow and orange. 
Once you go 
on the outside 
of the buoy, 
 you start heading back 
and you start picking up 
 tribe members. 
Once they are on board, though, 
they can start helping you 
 with paddles. 
You've got three paddles, 
and you've got one bailer, 
'cause you 
will take on water today, 
as rough 
as it is. 
It's for immunity.
Losing tribe's coming to
 Tribal Council tonight. 
So what I want to know is, 
how did you guys 
 get selected for this? 
Why are you the rower? 
Well, I'm a water all-star, 
so this is my element 
 right here, 
so there was no choice. 
You, on the other hand, 
 water is... 
as we've talked about, this 
 is a whole new thing for you. 
Yes, yes. 
Are you rowing
 because you'd 
rather row
 than swim?
I think that's what we 
 were thinking at first, 
but I knew it would be 
 something kind of tricky 
and it's show time, 
 so I like the spotlight. 
Really? Lot of pressure. 
Pressure's good. 
They're doing 
nothing out there. 
It is all 
the person on the boat. 
All right. Good luck. 
Good luck. 
 Thank you. 
For the idol, get in your boats.
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
( paddle splashing ) 
( paddles splashing ) 
( all shouting ) 
Get out! Get out! 
Get out!
 Get out!
Over here. 
Over this way. 
Over to the right. 
Get it up here!
( all cheering ) 
( cheering ) 
JEFF: 
Gervase's 
last words were, 
"I like the spotlight. 
Bring it on." 
Who's invincible 
tonight? 
Gervase! 
Does anybody 
feel especially 
invincible tonight? 
I got beat by a guy 
 who can't even swim. 
Yeah, but he 
 wasn't swimming.
Yeah. 
Go, Kelly. 
I can't 
 believe that
I lost that. 
Hey, guys,
the immunity idol. 
Welcome back home, 
 immunity idol! 
KELLY: 
 Tonight we have to take 
 the suckfest hike 
to the Tribal Council, 
and we get to vote somebody off
 tonight, unfortunately. 
You know, despite everything, 
I was the best choice 
to put in that boat today, 
and, you know, like I said, 
sometimes your best 
 just isn't good enough 
and life just wouldn't be life 
 if everybody didn't get 
their little embarrassments 
 from time to time, so... 
That which doesn't
 kill you 
makes you stronger,
 right, Sean? 
Absolutely. 
I say that to myself 
all the time. 
Me, too. 
Same exact sentence. 
Oh, yeah, it's always 
 in the back of my mind 
whether or not 
anyone's going to vote 
 against me. 
I don't have a vote 
 against me yet, 
and now we're losing numbers 
so I'm sure one's coming, 
just like the other people 
 who don't have a vote 
against them, one's coming 
 in their direction, too. 
I suspect it might be Rudy. 
That's how I'll probably cast 
 my vote at this point. 
I'm ready. 
RICHARD: 
 It's an interesting game, 
 but it's a game, 
and I've had 
 a strategy from day one. 
I've already built an alliance 
 and we're going to work through
as best we can right to the end
before the free-for-all. 
Just walking to our death 
 right here. 
DIRK: 
 I think I'm vulnerable. 
I've tried my hardest 
 and put as much effort 
if not more into everything, 
 but I haven't been successful 
in any areas so maybe some 
people will look at that 
 and say, 
"Dirk doesn't know 
 what he's doing. 
He's being lazy." Whatever. 
But I think they realize that 
 I'm a valuable member 
of this team, so I'm not 
 worried about being voted off. 
I think I'll be here tomorrow. 
Ready? 
What's to say? 
Tribal council. 
Tough situation. 
 Kelly, tell me about morale.
Two tough losses back-to-back. 
Personally, for me, 
 today was really hard. 
Um... coulda, shoulda, woulda 
a lot of things, you know? 
I said some things 
at the beach... whatever. 
I'm not making excuses,
not trying to, 
 not going to, you know?
I gave it my best today 
 and just wasn't good enough,
so ate a little crow, 
 it's all right. 
Doesn't mean I 
 have to like it.
Sean, your role here? 
Very nebulous. 
I don't know 
 what I'm doing here. 
After how long we been here? 
15, 16 days. 
I still haven't found my niche. 
I'm just here 
to have fun. 
I'll take it as far 
 as I can go 
till you throw me kicking 
 and screaming off this island. 
Yeah? 
 Dirk? 
It seems like 
 I've noticed 
you spending 
 more time alone.
How much of that time 
 do you spend thinking 
about how effective you are 
at fitting in this group? 
I'd say very little. 
I can't think myself into being 
more effective, you know? 
I'm working hard. 
I'm catching fish 
and I've been completely 
 unsuccessful. 
I'm working hard 
 at hunting tapioca 
and I've been completely 
 unsuccessful. 
I've been working ha... 
You know, it's like I've failed 
at everything I've tried, 
but it's not like 
 the effort's not there, 
you know what 
I'm saying? 
Yeah, man. 
 Richard? 
15 days now together, 
inevitable that certain 
alliances, even within a group, 
smaller factions begin 
 to develop. 
Have you guys 
 reached a point now
where you have 
 this tight unit
that these alliances are going 
to come in to play in the vote? 
The alliances that you talk 
 about, the Rudy and I 
and the Sean and Dirk 
 kind of hanging, 
and the Sue and Kelly together, 
are almost kind of little teams 
within a team doing things 
'cause it usually takes 
a couple of people to do things.
I think a bigger alliance is 
what all six of us have created 
so I don't think that 
 the smaller ones detract 
from how we feel about 
 the six of... 
all of us together. 
It's time to vote. 
Dirk. 
I love you, but I just can't 
 stand the complaining. 
For the first time, 
 I'm voting for Rudy, 
only because this is 
probably an athletic competition
 coming up 
that we're going 
 to have to win 
and that's the only reason 
I would cast a vote against him.
He's a phenomenal person. 
Fire represents life 
 on the island. 
Your torches represent 
 your identity here. 
Directly across from you are 
four torches that represent 
 the first four people 
that have been voted 
 off the island. 
Tonight, a fifth torch 
 will be added to that group. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Before I read the votes, 
I just want to remind you 
once they're tallied, 
 the decision is final 
and the person must 
 leave the island immediately. 
I'll read 
 the votes.
First vote... 
"Dirk." 
"Sue." 
"Rudy."
"Dirk."
That's two 
 votes for Dirk.
"Dirk." 
That's three votes.
We don't need to 
 read the last one.
The tribe 
 has spoken.
It's time for 
 you to go. 
All right. 
Good-bye. 
Guys, good luck. 
You can take your torches 
 and head back to camp. 
Good night. 
( primal singing ) 
JEFF: 
 Next week, on Survivor-- 
at Tagi, 
Rich goes native. 
Who cares? 
JEFF: 
 Over at Pagong, 
Gervase ruffles some feathers 
with a sexist remark. 
Girls are the stupidest thing 
 on the planet next to cows. 
It's a fact, though. 
Oh, I beg to differ. 
GRETCHEN: 
 So, I told those girls, 
when they write your name 
 on that piece of paper, 
and look straight into the lens 
 and go, "moo." 
I guess I want to start 
by just thanking the Lord 
just for this 
 unbelievable blessing. 
I mean, this whole thing 
 has just been one wild trip. 
He had 15 days planned 
 for me on this island. 
I believe I kicked it 
 as hard as I could. 
Completely surprised 
 to be taken out this early 
and I thank the Lord 
for that, 
'cause I know 
he's got a plan 
for me to move on 
somewhere else.
