         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans marooned 
 for 39 days 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Separated into two tribes, 
 Tagi and Pagong, 
they competed against each 
 other to remain on the island, 
but now the tribes 
 have merged into one. 
Rattana is the name, 
and it is everyone 
 for themselves. 
Every third night, 
the entire tribe will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council, 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 








In the end, one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 
Yeah, bait's gone. 
JEFF: 
 Food was scarce, 
 rice was being rationed... 
So a can's only going 
 to last us two days? 
They're eating that much. 
JEFF: 
 And Rich was still 
the only one providing fish. 
Rich is playing a big game. 
JEFF: 
 And so is Greg-- 
he cut 
 play-kitten Colleen loose. 
GREG: 
 You look right 
 in the kitten's eye and snap 
its neck. It's nothing personal.
 You're hungry. 








JEFF: 
 And made a move on Rich. 
RICHARD: 
 He's trying something. 
 That's great. 
JEFF: 
 The reward challenge 
brought videos from home... 
Hi, Daddy. 
Baby. 
JEFF: 
 Except for Jenna. 
Oh, don't... 
It would've done wonders to see
that my kids are okay. 
GERVASE: 
 She's tugging on people's 
 emotions right there 
and that's a threat for me. 
JEFF: 
 And at Tribal Council... 
Is there an alliance? 
Do I have to answer? 
No, I'm just kidding. 
No, no. 
JEFF: 
 Last week, Greg was voted off. 
Eight castaways remain. 
Who will be voted off tonight? 
That was my deal-- 
out of here. 
Well, I don't know 
 if they were... 
RICHARD: 
 Outright lying 
 is absolutely essential, 
especially when you have 
a host like Jeff, 
 who's as bold as to ask 
"Well, so Sue, tell me, 
 is there an alliance?" 
What a question. 
You think 
 I'm going to come out and say 
"Oh, yeah, we got four of us 
voting up against all you guys. 
We're going to knock you all 
down to the end." Come on. 
It won't be 
 bad if you get 
 in the water. 
COLLEEN: 
 Those people flat out lied 
in front of a national 
 television audience. 
I mean, 
 they want a million bucks 
and they're going to get it... 
And I loved Jeff's question 
"Is, uh, a deserving person 
going to win this money?" 
The answer to that question 
 is "no." 
How you doing this 
 morning, Kelly? 
I'm doing. 
I didn't really sleep 
 last night. 
No. 
 No? 
KELLY: 
 This whole alliance thing 
 is getting too stupid 
and too crazy. 
If we stick with it, 
it's just like lining lambs 
 to the slaughter. 
Who goes next? Who goes...? 
 like, that's no fun. 
I know. 
We were targeted 
already, anyway. 
If we keep 
 annoying them 
 like we are, 
we're going to be 
 gone really soon. 
KELLY: 
 Yeah, I don't like it. 
I-I'm not happy playing 
 the game that way. 
If I'm going to win, 
if I'm really going to be 
 the last survivor, 
if I'm really going to survive 
 and really do this, 
then it has to be on my own. 
SEAN: 
 Rich is definitely 
 in this very good 
strategic position 
for himself, I think. 
He's worked hard. 
Well, not that hard. 
Just happens to be good 
at spearfishing. 
He doesn't do much else. 
He sure don't do a damn thing 
 around here except fish. 
SEAN: 
 But he's a good sport. 
I mean, we call him all kinds 
 of names and make fun of him. 
I sort of liked him 
before I knew he was queer. 
Lost a prong to a good, 
 five-foot nurse shark. 
I got to take them 
by hand from now on, 
like Tarzan-style-- 
wrestle them. 
He's in an ideal position, 
 'cause I think 
he's the epicenter 
 of the power right now. 
He's bringing in the fish. 
Oh, my God. 
There's got to be 25 pounds 
 or 20 pounds of fish here. 
It's all about 
 the fish, man. 
The fish don't 
influence me, though. 
No? 
Not in the least. 
You can take the heavy-duty 
equipment and I'll putz. 
Okay. 
'Cause I fed you today. 
Yeah. 
SEAN: 
 I love Rich, I really do. 
He's been a great asset 
 to this camp, 
but he is a little immature 
 in his motives at times. 
You'll be so damn full 
of protein after this meal, 
you won't know 
what to do with yourself. 
This is funny. 
I am... 
This man... 
 the master. 
He's very protective 
 about spearing fish 
and he brings it up 
 at every island council: 
"I'm catching fish. 
 Don't vote me off." 
It's an insecurity aspect 
 to him. 
The last island Tribal Council 
when I was talking about, um... 
"I'll be staying around here 
 because I'm providing fish" 
was an outright blatant lie. 
I'm staying around here 
 'cause I'm bright. 
It has nothing to do 
 with catching fish. 
That is a 
 lot of fish.
RICHARD: 
 Catching fish 
 makes people happy, 
but that's not why 
they're voting me here. 
They're not voting me off 
because I'm not letting them. 
SUSAN: 
 Tell me if 
 I'm doing it... 
like cutting 
 too much meat. 
RICHARD: 
No, you're doing pretty well. 
Got it. 
Now rip it out. 
I'm sorry, I can't... 
You want 
 to do one? 
COLLEEN: 
 Do you see them 
bringing these stingrays 
and stuff in? 
They're, like, 
 still flapping around 
and they take this dull knife, 
 and chop off their head. 
It's disgusting. 
( loud slapping ) 
If I choose 
to watch my dinner 
 that came from the sea 
be killed or not be killed, 
I would rather not 
 watch it be killed. 
JENNA: 
 Rich, you're the man. 
You are the reef master. 
Yeah, there's some water 
over here. 
JENNA: 
 Oh, I'm so 
 looking forward 
to this now.
I wouldn't even eat fish sticks.
SUSAN: 
 I'm just hungry.
I could care 
 less about that.
When Rich came in 
 with a fish, 
I said to Rudy, "I should go 
 and stoke that fire up." 
And Rudy's, like, "Oh, no, 
 no, no, that's good enough. 
It's hot enough," 
and it wasn't hot enough. 
RICHARD: 
 Well, I would say 
 it's done, Rudy, 
and black. 
It curls up 
 into little balls. 
I know. 
SUSAN: 
 The fish is tough to cook 
because they cooked 
 a little bit 
and then they cooled off 
and they had to start 
 the fire back up 
and cook the fish again, 
 so Rich is sort of irritated. 
( rhythmic tapping ) 
RICHARD: 
 Rudy's clueless 
when it comes to fish, and, um, 
 you know, really ruined it. 
You ready? 
Yep. 
RICHARD: 
 Nobody knew what to do 
 with cooking the fish 
and so it sits here 
and it sits half on the heat, 
 and it sits over there 
and it gets turned over 
 halfway and it doesn't, 
and so it's half-cooked 
 and overcooked and undercooked 
and half of the fish, 
 half of the three rays 
were wasted... 
 and that infuriates me. 
It's overdone. 
It's charcoal. 
Its wings are curled up. 
It's very, very easy 
 to put a fire together 
that's nice and hot. 
Just 'cause I see 
 how to do that 
doesn't mean anybody else 
 should know how, so... 
I was sitting there, just 
 pissed off, really frustrated. 
I don't want anybody around 
I don't want anybody near me 
 when I'm frustrated, 
and people are sitting there, 
 "What's wrong?" 
and that just makes it worse. 
GERVASE: 
Don't be hard 
on yourself. 
Huh? 
Just take it easy-- 
 let us be hard on you. 
Okay. Go for it, dude. 
GERVASE: 
 Don't you know how 
 a fire works, man? 
RICHARD: 
 Uh-huh, I do... 
and I'm not really patient 
 about teaching anybody, 
so I'm just going 
 to do it myself from now on. 
I probably won't get fish 
actually for a little while now,
anyway, because they need 
 to appreciate it. 
I'm bringing in too many 
 right now. 
I brought in a bunch yesterday 
 and a bunch today 
and so we need 
 to take a break 
and let them kind of hunger 
 for it again. 
COLLEEN: 
 So many times Rich opens 
 his mouth, 
and I just want to be, like, 
"Oh, be quiet over there 
 in the corner. 
"You're not making any sense, 
 and you think you're so smart 
"and you're... just go home, 
 and go get your liposuction 
and go catch more fish, 
'cause you're bugging me." 
You know, he thinks 
 he's so above everybody 
and is full of baloney, really. 
RICHARD: 
 Pathetic, burnt, overdone 
wasteful again. 
Amazes me. 
KELLY: 
 The hardest part now is... 
( sighs ) 
...the food. 
We're hungry 
and Rich is the only one 
 that can fish. 
You got to go out 
 an hour before it gets dark 
and then, right at 
when it was getting dark, 
we started getting our bites 
and then, after it got dark, 
 we didn't get no more bites. 
We've gone fishing 
 in the morning. 
We've gone in the afternoon... 
 at night. 
We're not catching any fish. 
SUSAN: 
 I'm getting 
 to the point
if there ain't 
 no crabs out there 
in a day or two, 
I ain't gonna to do it no more. 
It bothers me 
 that I can't get my own food, 
that I have to rely 
 on someone else. 
Ooh, big fish. 
Oh, wow!
We got a fish, you guys, right? 
It's a fish, for sure. 
Whoo! 
That's so awesome. 
 Look at that thing. 
He's pretty big. 
Fish! 
Bloop. 
SUSAN: 
 Good proof 
that we can get the fish. 
We caught a fish today, 
 finally-- yes!-- 
and it feels so good. 
I feel so accomplished now. 
JENNA: 
 I think, uh, 
 it disappointed Rich 
that us girls 
 kept these crab traps going 
and that we caught a fish. 
That's good.
He's going to make 
 a big point 
"Oh, that ain't a lot 
 to feed you," 
but it's a point 
 that we did catch it. 
So, I don't give a ( blip ) 
about how he's going to see it. 
We caught it; 
 I feel accomplished. 
We've done it all now. 
We got a fish, man, 
 a edible fish. 
I ain't kidding you.
RUDY: 
Big one? 
SUSAN: 
 Yeah, pretty
 nice size. 
RUDY: 
Is he kicking? 
Yeah, he's 
 still alive.
Yeah, he's still alive. 
Yeah, that's a good one. 
I know it. 
SUSAN: 
 But, yeah, 
 he's going to be... 
I think it might bother him. 
In a way, I hope it does. 
I hope it bugs him, 
 'cause now he can't 
say that no more, you know? 
'Cause us girls 
 caught this one. 
( buzzing ) 
Oh, wow. 
I love getting mail 
and there was a log hanging 
above our mailbox. 
It looked an awful lot like 
 part of the tree, 
but when I took it down, 
 there was a sign on there 
a little a nursery rhyme, 
 it says: 
"If you can make like a monkey, 
"then you'll be home free, 
"if you want barbecue for lunch,
then go climb a tree." 
Somebody's eating 
a barbecue. 
That sounds like fun. 
Shish kebob! 
SEAN: 
 I'm sure the game is 
 anything but simple, 
just, like, 
 just pick a rope and run. 
Hey, look who it is! 
Hey, Jeff. 
Well, here's the deal. 
I thought today, 
we'd switch it up a little 
and show you the carrot, 
the reward, before the challenge
so you guys know 
 exactly what it is... 
Listen to 
 your stomach. 
You're going for. 
Are you 
 smelling this? 
This is 
today's reward. 
Oh, man! 
JEFF: 
 Some good, old-fashioned, 
 American barbecue. 
We got it all. 
All this stuff, here... 
Look at that, 
 a lot of meat. 
Steak and a hot dog. 
JEFF: 
 Some kebobs.
We got your buns... 
 your chips. 
A little something 
 to remind you of home. 
And since we're talking 
 about home... 
Why not?
Love letters from home. 
Jenna, yours on top. 
Oh, I got one! 
I'm so excited. 
JEFF: 
 One of you guys gets
 a great barbecue, 
you get to read your
 letter from home, 
and does it get any 
 better than that? 
Sound good? 
GERVASE: 
 I was shaking 
 when I saw the food. 
I started shaking 
 because I'm, like, 
 "That's real chicken." 
Now think about that 
and then think about rice. 
I'm thinking, 
 how am I going 
to get my grubby
 little hands 
on some of 
 them burgers. 
I'm prepared 
 to eat rice tonight... 
( chuckles ) 
like every night. 
I want the letter from home more
because I can go back 
 and get rice, 
but I haven't seen 
or heard anything from my kids. 
That's it, I'm going big, 
 going for all of it. 
No offense, Jeff, but if I win, 
you're going hungry, bud, 
 'cause I'm not sharing. 
Then, let's go do this thing 
 and come back and eat. 
Man, oh, man. 
I want this stuff. 
JEFF: 
 Here's the deal: 
basically, it's a ropes course. 
There are 16 legs. 
On each one of them is 
 a medallion with your number. 
You guys have all been 
 preassigned a number. 
Pretty simple-- you got to get 
 through all of them, 
grab a medallion from each one. 
First person back here 
 on this platform 
with all 16 of their medallions 
gets the barbecue. 
If you fall off the course, 
 you're out. 
Sound good? 
Everybody get ready.
You got an eye 
on where you're going? 
Get up here on the 
 ring, Sean... buddy.
Yeah. 
Survivors, ready?! 
Go! 
Aah! 
( laughing ) 
You got time, Rich. 
Five, five, five. 
JEFF: 
Good job, Rich. 
Your first medallion. 
Keep it up, 
 Colleen. 
You're in 
 second place. 
Okay, so I love being tall. 
JEFF: 
 Try to keep 
 mental notes
of where you've been
 and where you've 
still got to go. 
Careful, Jenna. 
Keep it up, Sean. 
12 more to go. 
Doing great, Rudy-- 
 fifth place. 
Come on, 
I got to go under you. 
Ready? 
 Ready? 
All right? 
Yep. 
JEFF: 
Good work together, 
guys, on the ladder. 
Keep at it, Rudy. 
You're still 
in the lead, Kelly. 
Oh, no. 
Done! 
You got to get back 
 here to the platform. 
Okay, is anybody
 else finished? 
Oh, that's me! 
Colleen or Kelly-- 
first one back 
 here wins. 
( squeals ) 
Colleen.
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
Nice job. 
( all talking excitedly ) 
That was awesome! 
Yeah! 
Colleen, right here.
Good job, Colleen. 
We've got 
this great barbecue-- 
it looked pretty good... 
a lot of food-- 
we've got a great letter 
from home. 
How about 
 inviting... 
Everybody! 
Not quite. 
 Don't even make
 me pick one. 
JEFF: 
 I do want you to pick one 
 person to come with us... 
Make it a party. 
 Do they get 
 the letter, too?
JEFF: 
 This person will
 get their letter
and this person 
will also get 
all the food. 
( clicking tongue ) 
( chuckling ) 
Jenna is going 
to hear from her kids. 
Good work. 
That wasn't 
a tough decision, was it? 
She didn't get a video. 
Thank you 
 so much. 
JEFF: 
 Very nice gesture. 
So, you guys can, um, 
sadly head back to camp 
and we're going to head down 
 to the beach 
and have a barbecue. 
Enjoy it, guys. 
I'll see you guys tomorrow. 
Okay. 
( laughing ) 
Listen to what 
Sean says today... 
What did he say? 
He goes, "Well..." 
'cause they voted four 
 against Dirk 
when he wasn't there. 
Then they voted four 
against Gretchen 
and then it's, like, 
they voted six 
against... but obviously, 
 four against Greg, 
and he's, like, 
 "If it happens one more time, 
I know..." 
and I was, like, 
"What are you talking about? 
It's happened three times." 
I mean, what's going on? 
But, see, Sean's the... 
Sean's the swing vote, 
 you know what I mean? 
'Cause you, me and Gervase 
 could definitely 
do something. 
They're going 
to pick people off 
until it gets down to them 
and then they're going 
 to start eating each other, 
you know what I mean? 
But I'm saying, like, 
 why are we sitting back 
and watching it happen? 
So, let's do it. 
( chuckling ) 
JEFF: 
 All right, 
 here are your letters. 
You read yours first. 
Oh, mine's so thick.
I love it. 
Go on 
and read yours. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, they're drawings! 
Oh, my... 
( laughing and crying ) 
Oh, my God. 
How cute. 
Yeah, we have them 
 all over the house. 
( sniffles )
My car interior windows 
 are decorated 
with stickers 
 I can no longer get off. 
"I'm proud of you... 
super, wonderful, hooray." 
Yep. 
( sniffling ) 
Happy birthday, Rich. 
RICHARD: 
Thanks, Suzy Q. 
SEAN: 
 Rich's birthday 
is today, 
and it's his 39th birthday 
and he celebrated immediately 
by taking off 
 all of his clothes 
and celebrating 
 in his birthday suit... 
which you never get used 
to seeing Richard naked. 
( laughs ) 
RICHARD: 
 I'm 39 today 
and I had intended 
for quite a long time 
to celebrate my birthday naked. 
And I'm sure he does love 
 to be naked, 
and I'm glad for that 
and I thought I'd be okay 
 with that, 
but sitting at the fire 
 this morning 
and he comes just walking up 
and sits, like, 
 two inches from me 
naked... 
I wanted to get away. 
( laughing ) 
All the nakedness, 
I'm just... 
I'm just having a problem 
 with this nakedness. 
It felt awkward 
sitting next to a naked gay man,
and if he had, like, something 
 to cover the butt crack area 
I'd be cool with that. 
RUDY: 
 When I go home, 
 my wife asks me about-- 
"Well, who was with you?" 
I'll say, "A queer 
 that ran around bare-ass 
half of the time," 
 for one thing. 
( laughing ) 
COLLEEN: 
 Rich wanted to be naked 
 for his birthday. 
Oh, fun. 
Show off a little more. 
I mean, he was doing it 
 for shock value. 
It's goofy. 
Who walks around naked 24/7? 
I think you were doing 
 it for shock value. 
RICHARD: 
 For shock value?
Is it shock value? 
I don't know 
 if it's shock value or not. 
Colleen was particularly 
 uncomfortable with my nakedness
and when she saw me naked, 
she just made a funny face 
and put her hands over her face 
and who knows what that's 
 intended to signal? 
I said to you, like, 
 "Oh, my God, Rich." 
But if I lived my life 
 based on what 
made other people 
 uncomfortable, 
I wouldn't be 
 living my life. 
 My life. 
COLLEEN: 
 I love that Rich gets annoyed 
with me-- 
 that makes me happy-- 
and he really has 
 in the past two days 
and it just makes me want 
 to egg him on more. 
Oh, big deal. 
Who gives a crap? 
I'm naked, whoopee. 
( laughing ) 
( seabirds screeching ) 
Oh, yes, we have a clue.
"Our next challenge is 
 a battle of wit 
"Just make sure 
there's always 
"a new square to hit, 
"being immune 
at the council 
"is what it's about, 
"paint yourself 
in a corner 
and you'll find 
yourself out." 
What? 
( squeals ) 
Ooh, we get 
to play mind games now... 
Not that we're 
not playing mind games now. 
It's crunch time now. 
It's getting down 
 to the final wire 
and I'm amazed 
 that I'm still here 
and I got 12 days left. 
"Our next challenge 
 is a battle of wit..." 
It's not even a strategy. 
I'm just really focused now, 
 on winning these challenges. 
"Paint yourself in..."
kind of like twister. 
GERVASE: 
 I'm trying to think, 
"How did I lose yesterday 
and how can I stop that 
 from happening again today?" 
'Cause today is even bigger 
 than the food 
when it comes down to it. 
You know, I'd rather not eat 
and get that immunity challenge
 every time. 
I know the only way 
 I'm going to stay 
is to win the challenges, so... 
that's the only thing 
 I'm worried about. 
That's the only thing 
 I'm focusing on 
is winning the challenges. 
I think it's a fair system. 
I think you're 
 a perfect example. 
I'm glad I decided 
 to not go back 
for the alphabetical order 
 after you won immunity 
'cause it gives the contestant 
 an out to avoid my vote. 
It adds a new dimension 
 to the game 
I'll be going alphabetically. 
( laughs ) 
COLLEEN: 
Sean! 
SEAN: 
 Yeah? 
Yeah, did you know 
that we're going by Zelda now? 
Zoey. 
SEAN: 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, Zoey and Zelda. 
Why? Why do 
 you want that? 
Uh, alphabetical reasons. 
Oh. 
I'm going in alphabetical 
 order-- Jenna is next. 
It would make me happy 
if Gervase does not win immunity
 this time 
'cause I had 
 to skip him last time-- 
you know, 
 I skipped him in the order-- 
and maybe Jenna will win it 
and get out of the order. 
I know it's nice 
that if you win immunity, 
you get skipped 
 and then you never get 
in the rotation, like Ger. 
JENNA: 
Oh, you're out 
of the rotation? 
Ger is out of the rotation. 
Oh, so I'm next. 
 Yeah. 
KELLY: 
 Sean's going around 
 telling everybody 
"Don't be in the alliance. 
Don't..." um... 
"vote your conscience." 
Meanwhile, he's going around 
 preaching everyone 
to vote their conscience 
and he's, like, 
 "Oh, okay, alphabetically." 
SEAN: 
 My votes are going 
 to go alphabetical. 
So, today's Jenna. 
If I'm going 
 to be the swing vote-- 
which I don't think 
 I will be-- 
then I won't vote for her, 
 obviously. 
GERVASE: 
 Sean... I like Sean. 
Sean's a great guy, you know, 
but about Sean's 
 alphabetical order. 
It's like my granddaddy 
 used to say: 
"If you want to be seen, 
 stand up, 
"If you want to be heard, 
 speak up, 
and if you want 
 to be appreciated, shut up." 
I'm just going to stay 
in alphabetical order. 
It's all I can do. 
We've tested 
 your physical strength, 
your swimming ability, 
 your agility, 
your speed... all that. 
Today is something 
 a little different. 
It's up here, in your head. 
This is a game 
that requires strategy. 
It's a lot like chess, 
a little bit 
like tic-tac-toe, 
but unlike chess, 
where you're taking one person, 
you've got seven people 
to think about. 
The way the game works is 
you'll start on a square 
and you'll simply, 
 one at a time, on my cue 
move to another square, 
turning the square over 
 behind you. 
As long 
as you can keep stepping 
to another square, 
you're still alive, 
but when you run out 
of red squares 
to step on, you're out. 
So now, if you just flip over 
these squares here, 
we'll determine 
the order. 
Oh, yeah, baby. 
Oh, yes. 
Now, in any particular order, 
step on one 
 of the flower squares. 
It does not matter. 
These are all even 
when you begin. 
So, Rich, you're up first. 
Perfect. Rudy. 
Sean. 
Gervase, to you. 
Sue. 
Colleen. 
Kelly. 
Jenna. 
Sue. 
Colleen. 
Colleen. 
Yeah... I'm out! 
JEFF: 
Take a step back 
and flip 
that one over. 
There you go. 
Take a seat 
on the log. 
That full meal 
has got you... 
sated. 
All right... Kelly. 
Jenna-- out on the island 
 by herself. 
Kelly. 
SUSAN: 
 Just had to get 
 in the center. 
Looks like you're out, 
Kelly. 
Just doing my part. 
JEFF: 
Join Colleen 
over there. 
Jenna. 
Rich. 
I'm out. 
Sue, you're out.
All right. 
Jenna. 
Sean, you foiled my plan. 
SEAN: 
Sorry, baby. 
Was that your 
 plan, Sean? 
No. Well, yeah, once she 
 got behind me, yeah, yeah. 
To block her? 
Rich. 
You need to worry 
 about yourself, Hatch. 
No, there's nothing 
I can do. 
I'm whimpering 
into nowhere-land, here... 
Rudy. 
Slowly 
 dying... 
the wise old man 
is looking good. 
Sean. 
Oh, no, Sean, 
 no, Sean. 
Don't you know 
you're dead, Sean? 
You're ruining it. 
You got 50 million. 
She won't last, Sean. 
Rudy will last longer. 
He'll have to kill me. 
Otherwise, I could 
 have bebopped around. 
Sorry. I'm doing what 
 I think is right. 
JEFF: 
Gervase. 
 Oh, Sean... 
Bad move, Sean. 
You could have gotten Rudy 
 out of there. 
No, he 
 couldn't have. 
 Yes, he could have. 
All right, Rich. 
Rudy. 
Rudy has many 
 more options. 
Down there. 
He's doing right. 
You should've 
 diagonal so... 
Don't listen 
 to her, Rudy. 
She's trying to 
 trick you, Rudy.
Shut up. 
 I am not. 
It's those young girls, 
Rudy, 
trying to get 
in your head. 
Stay strong,
 Rudy. 
JENNA: 
 Is it my turn? 
Gervase. 
Still alive.
Jenna, you, 
 unfortunately, 
 are not. 
You're out. 
I figured 
 you are. 
Yoo-haw! 
JEFF: 
 Rich, turn over 
your last tile--
 you're done. 
Bye! 
Rudy, it's down 
 to you three 
for immunity from 
 tonight's vote. 
Go sidewards! 
Go left, Rudy, go left! 
GERVASE: 
 No coaching 
 from the side. 
No, no, no. 
 Directly to your left. 
GERVASE: 
 To the right, Rudy! 
Take... take... 
No, left, Rudy, 
because then you 
 have down here... 
Up to the right, Rudy. 
She's trying to trick you. 
No, no, no, 
 no, buddy. 
This one. 
Yeah, there 
you go. 
Good job, Rudy. 
Gervase. 
Ain't gonna work. 
You've won, Rudy, 
if you take that path. 
SUSAN: 
 If you go at a 
 diagonal across,
you got more squares
 than him to land on.
JENNA: 
You've got more squares left. 
There you go! 
SUSAN: 
 There you go. 
Yeah, now you're 
 heading up to the beach. 
I think it's
 a foregone 
 conclusion. 
( sighs ) 
Flip that over, 
 Gervase. 
JENNA: 
Good job, Rudy. 
SUSAN: 
 There you go. 
You got it, Rudy. 
Hang tight, buddy. 
We're going to be 
 taking that tile 
 from you any minute.
( cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 Rudy, you win. 
Take the honor of 
 flipping the rest 
of these over for me. 
( buzzing ) 
Tonight's going 
to be interesting. 
Oh, yeah? 
SUSAN: 
 Really, when they 
 first got here, 
they were 
 really ambitious. 
Now you can see 
their ambition's 
kind of, like, 
filtering a little bit. 
If I feel like sitting 
 in a hammock all day, 
I'm going to sit 
 in a hammock all day. 
I'm not going 
 to stop you. 
No. 
COLLEEN: 
 We had fun, you know? 
We had-- Pagong was a good, 
was a good place to live. 
Now we moved 
into the new neighborhood 
with the nasty neighbors. 
( grunting ) 
SUSAN: 
 I want to go over 
in my house for 
 awhile and bitch. 
COLLEEN: 
 Then we came in here 
like, "Maybe we can 
 all be friends" 
and they came in, like, 
 "We can smash 'em." 
Yes, they did. 
COLLEEN: 
 The people who came in swinging
 were Rich and Sue. 
They knew. 
They're smart. 
They're very smart people... 
Although Rich 
 is just a numskull. God! 
RICHARD: 
 All you 16, 15 weirdoes 
 are making me nutty. 
I'm losing my mind. 
COLLEEN: 
 People are wishy-washy. 
They're conniving 
 and they're stupid, 
and that's what's happening, 
and it's all out in the open 
 for everybody to see. 
The decision 
 that I feel I'm left with is 
do I interact 
 with these people, have fun 
and just wait 
 till my ticket comes up 
or do I try and strategize 
 and try and make a difference? 
It's so sad now. 
You know, we just wait, 
you know? 
Unless... 
we think of something. 
( whistling ) 
Yesterday, at the dinner, 
we had a whole conversation 
about forming a new alliance. 
Yeah, shh... 
We're going to vote the same 
and we figure that this puts us 
 in jeopardy for the next one, 
but we were 
in jeopardy anyway, so... 
GERVASE: 
 Well, we tried 
 the "be nice, honor" way. 
It didn't work, 
 so don't be stupid anymore. 
It's just, we're smarter now. 
We saw that 
 that way didn't work, 
so we got to switch gears. 
COLLEEN: 
 What if I 
just had this 
 as a skirt? 
Oh, that's killer! 
GERVASE: 
 I don't think 
 models even wear
skirts that short. 
JENNA: 
 Go for it, Colleen! 
 Wear it! 
Not doing that, Sue? 
Jenna and I were just, 
you know, goofing off 
and, uh, Kelly decided 
 to join in. 
I feel bad for Kelly 
 because she wants to play. 
And Rich is, like, 
 "Something's happened to you 
"since these girls came. 
I'm really worried about you," 
kind of putting her in her place
and makes her feel 
a little self-conscious. 
By her being nervous 
and wishy-washy 
 about where her loyalties lie, 
it's really making 
 Sue and Rich nervous. 
You're young. 
You hung out 
with the chicks. 
There's more Pagong members 
than Tagi members 
and the Pagong members... 
Pagong members don't
 like any of us. 
They like you a lot better 
than any of us. 
Kelly's acting a little odd. 
She's dressing like 
 the other two that are her age,
and I'm hoping 
that Kelly hasn't, uh, 
 shifted trust 
and-and joined forces 
 with somebody else. 
All them girls 
are dressed the same today. 
SEAN: 
 Yeah, they're dressing 
 like, uh, superheroes. 
RUDY: 
 Like who? 
Superheroes. 
They were dancing around here 
a little while ago. 
It looked like 
the third grade. 
I thought 
 about a female alliance 
and watching them, 
the way they walk around, 
 hand in hand. 
I even thought about lesbianism,
 but, uh, maybe not. 
I don't know. 
And, uh, it could happen 
 if they had any brains, 
but I don't think they got 
enough brains to do that. 
I move objects with my mind, 
but only I can see it. 
KELLY: 
 I probably will have 
the swing vote tonight. 
I'd said before, you know, 
 alliance or no alliance, 
there's two people that I have 
 in mind to vote off 
and they're two people that, 
 um, are-are competition, 
but, um, they annoy me 
and... ( chuckling ) 
they're kind of sucky 
 to live with. 
Let's roll, Gervase.
Get out of here.
COLLEEN: 
 I really don't know 
 what's going to happen 
at Tribal Council tonight. 
I know I'm voting for Rich. 
I know Jenna's voting for Rich. 
I know Gervase 
 is voting for Rich. 
GERVASE: 
 As long as he's catching fish, 
people are gonna try 
 to keep him around, 
so I say, get rid of Rich 
 and we all starve together. 
JENNA: 
 The rest of my alliance, 
if that's what 
 you want to call it? 
Yeah, we're all voting for Rich.
He's ruthless 
and the fact that we're voting 
him out on his birthday-- 
it's not lost on me. 
We're giving him 
 a birthday present. 
Okay, let's do this, Brutus! 
Gotta go. 
JEFF: 
 Today's immunity challenge 
 saw wisdom and strategy 
outplay youth and strength. 
Tonight it's Rudy 
 who's safe from the vote 
as the others 
 contemplate their fate. 
But this is not 
 the only vote on their mind. 
Beginning tonight with Greg, 
all members voted off the island
will return 
 to subsequent Tribal Councils 
as part of a jury. 
They will gather information 
for a very important decision, 
because, ultimately, 
 these seven will decide 
who, of the final two survivors,
leaves the island 
 with the million-dollar prize. 
( gong clanging ) 
You're back.
Tribal Council 
 number nine. 
27 days you guys
 have been here. 
At the last 
 Tribal Council, 
 we established 
our core group of nine, 
 so from that 
two of you will make 
 it to the final vote. 
The other seven 
will form a jury that 
 will really decide 
that final vote.
Now, in order to make 
 an informed decision, 
the jury needs 
 information. 
So, beginning tonight, Greg 
 will be joining us here 
as part of the jury.
He's merely here
to observe, gather 
 information 
that he'll base 
 his decision on 
and at each tribal 
 council, when somebody 
 else is voted off, 
they will return to join Greg. 
Happy birthday 
 to you, Mr. Hatch. 
Thanks, Jeff. 
Something we talked about today.
You were going to spend the day 
 in your birthday suit. 
That was part of your original 
 idea, anyway. 
Yep. 
A couple of people 
 voiced concern 
that, uh, "Maybe 
 I don't like this." 
Well, I just enjoy 
being nude. 
I'm on a deserted island in the 
middle of the South China Sea. 
I thought, what better place? 
What better place than 
 to just hang out nude? 
But it did make a couple 
 of people uncomfortable 
so I thought, 
"Why bother?" 
Sean. I got to ask you 
about the alphabet thing. 
The alphabet. 
Give me the rationale so I'm 
 absolutely clear on it. 
The rationale 
is manyfold. 
First of all, 
it gives me an order 
that I can follow 
pretty easily-- 
that's always nice. 
And it is strategic. 
If you look at the order, 
the actual alphabet, 
a lot of the Pagong people 
in the beginning, 
a lot of Tagi people 
in the end. 
This tortures me. 
Every three days. I hate it. 
Jenna, what's 
 your take on that? 
I'm next. 
I'm today. 
That's true.
Yes. I'm "J." 
That's, that's cool. 
She knows she wouldn't 
take it personally 
and I think 
she's a safe vote tonight. 
If I was... felt 
she was in jeopardy, 
I would think twice 
 at the very least 
of casting a vote. 
Sue, what's your
 take on that 
as somebody who 
 might come up soon 
in the alphabet 
and get a vote 
against you 
even if Sean 
thinks you're the 
 greatest person here? 
Oh, Sean just... 
 he's neurotic. 
He's just, he's an idiot. 
SEAN: 
 Thanks a lot, Sue. 
Thank you very much. 
It's like 
wow, okay, 
 so I'm next, you know? 
That's the way he votes, 
 that's the way he votes. 
I... I just think he just... 
I don't know, that 
 or he doesn't have 
enough balls to make a decision.
I don't have 
a malicious bone in my body 
and I think that 
casting a vote, 
it makes me 
feel malicious. 
I want to avoid it. 
Yeah, but you came 
into this knowing... 
knowing you were going 
to have to do this. 
Me, I've changed my vote 
like, three times 
within the last two hours. 
And now it's me, right? 
( laughing ) 
No. No. 
How important 
 is Richard right now? 
He seems to be the only guy-- 
 at least of who's left-- 
that's able 
 to catch fish. 
No. We did today. 
Trapped it. 
We nailed a fish today 
 in the trap. 
We have a bream. 
 They got a fish. 
SUSAN: 
 We got a fish today. 
A nice-sized fish. 
I'm outta here. 
We gave it 
to Richard for his birthday. 
All right, it's 
 time to vote. 
Gervase.
My vote's for Rich 
because the longer Rich is 
 on this island, 
the bigger of a threat 
 he becomes to me 
taking that million dollars, 
so I figure 
 if I get rid of him now, 
everybody else will be cake, 
so, happy birthday, Rich. 
Eliminating a big mouth. 
Continuing my alphabetic 
 strategy, 
Jenna, you know I love you, 
 no offense to this. 
I hope you don't get voted off. 
I don't think... 
you might have one vote or two 
 votes or something like that 
but nothing major, 
 I don't think. I hope. 
Fish or not, I think 
 he's getting near the point, 
he's ready to go home. 
Even though it is his birthday. 
JEFF: 
 As always, 
 your identity 
at Tribal Council is noted 
 by your fire, your torch. 
Directly across from you
are the eight torches 
of the first eight people 
 voted off. 
Tonight, another torch will be 
 added to that group 
and that person will join Greg 
 next week as part of our jury. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
I just want to remind you 
that once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
to leave the Tribal Council area
 immediately. 
Now I'll read the votes. 
That's three votes for Jenna, 
 three votes for Rich. 
The last vote... 
"J" for Jenna. 
Jenna, you need to bring
 your torch over. 
Jenna, the tribe
 has spoken. 
It's time for 
 you to go. 
Thanks. 
Good-bye. 
Jenna is now part 
 of the jury. 
She'll return next week 
 and join Greg. 
The rest of you 
can head back to camp. 
Good night. 
Next week on Survivor... 
 A cigar!
Good news for Gervase. 
Hey, everybody, it's a boy! 
Having left the alliance, 
will Kelly now vote 
 against them? 
You're seeming 
more down. 
KELLY: 
 And if I'm going to do 
 something tonight... and dirty,
let's get Rich off. 
Me and Kelly are 
 taking him down. 
Well, I had a good time. 
It was a great time 
on the island. 
I felt like I was 
 targeted tonight 
because they knew that 
Sean would vote for me 
 alphabetically, 
so they knew they'd get 
 an easy off with me. 
They were more 
 powerful because 
 Pagong went into it 
a little naive, 
 so, that's it. 
I had 
 a really good time, 
and no hard feelings 
and nothing's 
taken personally.
