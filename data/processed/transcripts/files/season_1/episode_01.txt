         JEFF PROBST: 
 From this tiny, 
 Malaysian fishing village, 
these 16 Americans are 
 beginning the adventure 
of a lifetime. 
They have volunteered 
 to be marooned for 39 days 
on mysterious Borneo. 
This is their story. 
This is Survivor. 
Are we getting two of these? 
Where's that box? 
JEFF: 
You are witnessing 16 Americans 
 begin an adventure 
that will forever change 
 their lives. 








They've been given two minutes 
 to salvage whatever they can 
off this boat. 
Their destination: 
 this island right here, 
a beautiful, 
 but dangerous jungle 
in the middle 
 in the South China Sea. 
Who's got oars?! 
Oh, we got our lifejackets. 
For the next 39 days, 
 they'll be marooned, 
left to fend for themselves, 
no creature comforts. 
They are wiping the slate clean.
Grab it! 
16 strangers forced 
 to band together 
to carve out a new existence, 








totally accountable 
 for their actions. 
They must learn to adapt, 
 or they're voted off. 
In the end, 
 only one will remain 
and will leave the island 
with $1 million in cash 
 as their reward. 
Go, go, go! 
39 days, 16 people, 
 one survivor. 
Grab it! 
Hey, behind you! 
Get off the raft! 
Get off the other side! 
Get off the raft! 
The rod, Sean! 
Listen up! 
Grab your backpacks!
Put them on!
Go! Let's do it! 
Whoo! 
Here we go! 
Whoo! 
The 16 contestants have been 
 separated into two tribes 
named after the beaches 
 where they will live. 
The Tagi Tribe, 
 who will always wear orange, 
consists of: Sean Kenniff 
 a neurologist from Long Island;
Kelly Wiglesworth, 
 a river guide from Las Vegas; 
Rudy Boesch, a retired Navy 
 SEAL from Virginia; 
Sonja Christopher, 
 a 63-year-old cancer survivor 
from San Francisco; 
Richard Hatch, a corporate 
 communications consultant 
from Rhode Island; 
Susan Hawk, a truck driver 
 from Wisconsin; 
Dirk Been, a young dairy 
 farmer, also from Wisconsin, 
and Stacey Stillman, 
 a litigation attorney 
from San Francisco. 
The Pagong Tribe, 
 who will always wear yellow, 
consists of: 
Gervase Peterson, 
 a YMCA basketball coach 
from Philadelphia; 
Colleen Haskell, an advertising
 student from Miami; 
B.B. Andersen, a real estate 
 developer from Kansas city; 
Ramona Gray, 
 a biochemist from New Jersey; 
Gretchen Cordy, a preschool 
 teacher from Tennessee; 
Greg Buis, a recent Ivy League 
 graduate from Colorado; 
Jenna Lewis, a single mother 
 and full-time student 
from new Hampshire, 
and Joel Klug, a health club 
 consultant from Little Rock. 
( shouting orders 
 to each other ) 
Hard to imagine 
that just four hours ago, 
this group met 
 for the first time 
in a small fishing village 
 on the coast of Borneo. 
Their minds racing 
 with questions, 
wondering, "Can I do this?" 
This is more than just a test 
 of survival skills. 
It's also a test 
 of social skills. 
Here, it's the impressions 
 you make on the other castaways
that determines your fate. 
Under the rules, one tribe 
 must visit Tribal Council 
every three days 
 with a single purpose: 
vote one of their own members 
 off the island. 
To win, you must survive 
 the island, 
survive the vote, 
and, ultimately, 
 survive each other. 
Whoo! 
I'm giving you 
 a degree-- 
a university 
honorary degree. 
Whoo! 
Damn, when you 
 guys get up, 
now the whole 
 thing goes... 
Whoa! Watch out! 
Here we go. 
We got a great view 
 of Snake Island! 
Get to work. 
We got oars. 
We got buckets. 
We're set for months. 
Hey, who knows, we could make 
 a mud house with it. 
You know, 
that could be like rebar. 
RUDY: 
 Paddling over, we had two 
 or three of those boxes 
in the water, 
dragging them behind the raft 
and that is dumb. 
I said, 
 "Let's get them boxes aboard. 
It'll be a lot easier." 
You know, 
 "That's deadweight you got." 
KELLY: 
 He was yelling at everybody 
"Let's lose the box! 
Cut it loose now!" 
He may be 72 years old 
 and an ex-Navy SEAL, 
but that doesn't mean 
 that this is his world. 
RICHARD: 
Rudy, Sean, Stacey, Sue, 
can we take 15 minutes 
and just talk before 
we do anything? 
Sure. 
Can we piss first? 
Just a suggestion. 
Should we take 
 a break? 
No, keep paddling! 
One break at a time!
One water break at a time. 
We want to get closer 
 to the island 
before we turn up. 
I'll distill you 
all the water you want, 
just get me 
to the island. 
You guys, we are so close. 
Keep going, 
 we're there.
( retching noise ) 
You all right? 
We're almost there, 
 Roe, hang in. 
Okay. 
Got it going 
 right over here.
Straight ahead of us. 
Where'd he point? 
Right there. 
Straight up there. 
Whoo! 
And we're all here. 
Let's go. 
Yeah! 
Whoo-hoo! 
This is what I was 
talking about! 
Ramona, how you 
doing, honey? 
RAMONA: 
 I don't like being on the water
 all that much. 
So, I mean, the whole motion 
 like this, 
and we're rowing, 
and we have like 100 pounds 
 of stuff on the raft, 
I just, I started heaving. 
Good job. 
 Good job. 
RAMONA: 
 I'm used to being in a lab 
 with my lab coat on, 
in the air-conditioning. 
But this is, like, outdoors, 
 24-7, 
and you're exerting energy, 
 like, almost all of that time. 
Oh, my God. 
This is just Day One. 
Should we, uh, you know, 
 talk for a little bit, 
or should we start moving 
 stuff up? 
Hey, let's discuss some things, 
 man. 
Let's figure some things out. 
Here's what we 
 plan on doing. 
High tide is that 
 line right there, 
 see that line? 
Yeah, uh-huh. 
So it shouldn't 
 come up to here.
And this piece of 
 bamboo back here, 
we can lay it from up here, 
 over to there, 
and that'll be the beginning 
 of our shelter. 
Actually, before 
 we build a shelter, 
just knock that 
 whole branch off. 
No, I mean, this 
 is an awesome spot. 
I'm just saying... 
What's the first thing 
we need to do? 
Shelter. 
We need a latrine. 
Okay, so we don't need 
fire tonight? 
That's an option. 
We got enough water 
to make it tonight. 
You guys, I think first 
thing we ought to do 
is talk about how 
we're going to do 
whatever 
we're going to do-- 
talk about the process. 
Listen, listen. 
Let me give you 
a rough quick. 
The camp will be 
right there. 
We'll clear these leaves off. 
That's a flat piece of ground. 
The latrine will be down there. 
The wind's hitting me 
 in the back right now. 
SEAN: 
 So, we're saying 
 we need a latrine 
and a clear place 
to sleep, is that all? 
Food. 
And if we need 
more... 
Let's check the box,
 before we make 
 any decisions. 
Let's see what we got. 
There might be a 
 blowtorch in there. 
We need a bathroom. 
Are you guys 
all done talking? 
Huh?
I don't know. 
I'm done. 
I'm going to open 
 up a box. 
I'm looking 
 for Fritos. 
DIRK: 
 Rich, um, I appreciate 
 what he's trying to do 
as far as bring the team 
 together and stuff, 
'cause that's one thing 
 that needs to happen. 
I think he's got some good 
 skills in that area. 
And, unfortunately, 
people like that annoy me. 
I'm just thinking, 
I think we're off 
 to a bad start. 
Why, 'cause 
we're not talking? 
Yeah. 
Sometimes, though, 
Richard, um, 
you kind of got 
to do things 
and talk 
as you go along, 
and sometimes things 
can't be that planned out. 
I agree with you. 
The problem with having 
 no conversation whatsoever, 
or lots of people talking 
 about different things 
is that nobody's working 
 toward a particular goal. 
Not the silly 
 little stuff about, 
oh, who's going 
 to sleep where? 
What are we 
 going to do? 
But why are we here? 
And what's the point? 
And if we don't... 
Oh, I figured that out 
before I come here. 
For you... 
And you haven't? 
And I have for me, 
but we haven't for us. 
And for the next 
 seven ejections, 
21 days, we have 
 to function together, 
or we fail. 
What do you think 
we're doing now? 
Not functioning 
 together at all. 
I'm a redneck, and I don't know 
 corporate world at all, 
and corporate world 
ain't gonna work out here 
in the bush. 
No, I'm not talking 
corporate world. 
I'm talking 
creating a team. 
I thought we were doing good. 
But, see, creating a team 
is actually putting 
 all of our hands together... 
Not hands, all of us knowing 
 what we're doing. 
Yeah, the hand thing, 
 yeah, but that's... 
Action, man. Action, Richard. 
Action. 
Well, you don't want 
 to act ahead. 
RICHARD: 
 I'm good to go survivalwise. 
Peoplewise, it'll be 
 a little more challenging. 
But I've got the million dollar
 check written already. 
I mean, I'm the winner. 
And it's that kind of cocky 
 attitude that makes people 
really hate your guts. 
So that's the kind of thing, 
 I've really got to keep, uh... 
under wraps. 
But, uh, it's just, 
 how do I get there from here? 
What's that?
Whoa! Look at this, folks. 
If this is kerosene, 
 and we didn't take 
 one of those lamps... 
We can make torches 
 and stuff out of twine. 
We could twine all 
 the rafts together. 
JOEL: 
What is that? 
Biscuits. 
Yeah, it's 
 definitely biscuits,
'cause we got corn... 
Well, look, we 
 got a frying pan. 
Oh, we are so set. 
Look, I'm shaking it. 
Can anyone hear 
the biscuits? 
Oh, ho, we got 
 a team flag. 
Whoo-hoo! 
If that's our latrine, 
I say we 
dig a hole, 
put this here, 
knock a board 
out of the bottom, 
then we can keep 
moving it across. 
Let's plug the hole. 
SEAN: 
 Let's sit down and talk 
 about what the hell 
we're going to do. 
RICHARD: 
 Can I help? 
When I asked earlier 
 about having a conversation, 
that's what I was talking about,
and I really can help 
 with how we can do this. 
We wanted to see... 
You guys, we came over here 
 to talk. 
We just want 
 to see what we... 
RICHARD: 
 What happens when 
 people get together is 
if they aren't all 
 headed in the same direction, 
toward a particular goal, 
then things that individuals do 
kind of get in the way 
 of the whole team, and I think 
it's really, really important 
 that what we decide 
be decided as a group. 
So, if you hear somebody 
 saying something 
and you're all aggravated 
 with them, stop, 
don't try to make your point 
and try and help them 
 make theirs. 
So, for example,
 you know, Sean, 
what do you think 
 a main point 
of what I'm trying 
 to say now is? 
I didn't listen to a word you...
I've been daydreaming, thinking,
"What am I going to eat?" 
Well, you'll 
 begin to figure 
 that out... 
All right, we 
 got a stick up. 
Well, as long as they can 
hit the middle of this hole, 
we're all set here. 
Put it right like this. 
This is perfect. 
Hey, we found a water map! 
You got it? 
We got a water map. 
B.B.: 
 "Enter jungle here." 
"Walk 375 paces 
along..." 
Oh, we start here. 
We go back 
to the other stream down there 
and then we get 
the water here. 
B.B.: 
 Here's where we are right here.
We have to go 
across the stream. 
We go across one stream... 
two streams, 
three streams. 
 Two streams, 
 three streams.
All right. 
All right, 
 we're ready to roll.
All right. 
You all right? 
Okay, is this the path? 
Well, it said 
 "newly cut path." 
It looks 
newly cut, but... 
"trail washes out." 
Oh, the trail 
 washes out. 
Oh, wa...? 
No? 
B.B.: 
 Why don't you stay there 
 for a minute? 
Let me walk 
and keep you
 in sight... 
Okay. 
...to see if I see... 
Anything? 
...anything 
 that resembles anything. 
( sighs ) 
Do you see anything? 
Huh?
Look here. 
I mean, come here 
 and look at it. 
Okay, ready? 
Oh, thank you, 
 Jesus. 
Christ! 
Yeah. 
There we are. 
Go ahead. 
All right. 
Way to go, B.B. 
Don't let me drop 
 sweat in there. 
Okay, it's almost full. 
You know, we could 
 never do this, 
but you know what 
 thought crossed my mind?
What? 
As long as you 
 and I always know 
 where the water is 
and we got control 
 of the water map, 
no one else will
 be able to vote 
 you or I out. 
We're not giving up 
the secret... 
We're not giving
 up the secret. 
...of the water supply. 
That's right! 
( all chuckling ) 
And your wife 
is how old now? 
B.B.: 
 My wife? 
 Right now? 
Yeah. 
She's 45. 
Wow. And how old are you? 
64. 
Oh, you better go. 
You are a stud. 
He's a stud!
His name's Viagra. 
Viagra. That's his nickname. 
Dang! 
You know, you got to do 
what you got to do, right? 
Somebody has to do 
the dirty work. 
If we don't keep some humor... 
 we'll go mad. 
Good night, y'all. 
Good night. 
Good night. 
Stretch out. 
RUDY: 
 The hardest part 
is hanging around 
 with all these young kids. 
I don't even know 
what MTV means, you know? 
And I'm used to being 
 in the military 
and one guy stands up, 
 he gives an order 
and there's no back talk. 
You know, like yesterday, 
everybody's trying 
 to run the show 
and if they'd let 
 one person do it, 
we'd be much better off. 
But trying to keep them all 
 shut up is hard. 
If they listen to me, 
they'd all have haircuts 
 and everything else, you know. 
We'd be in formation 
 in the morning 
and all that kind of stuff, 
but they're not 
 going to do that. 
I got to fit in, not them. 
You know, there's more of them 
 than there is of me. 
Hey, you got 
a pierced nipple, eh? 
Yeah. I got the ol' 
 pierced nipple thing. 
How did that feel? 
Pretty edgy for 
 a doctor, right?
Yeah, yeah. 
I thought I was making it 
 with the hair 
and then this morning, 
when I ran my hand through it 
and felt these couple 
of golf ball-sized knots in it, 
I'm like, no, they got 
 to come out now. 
SONJA: 
I was doing something. 
I don't even remember 
 how I did it. 
Betadine won't hurt it, 
yeah, so we'll give it 
a little shot of Betadine. 
I think these are 
the only sponges we have, 
so I'm just going 
to keep reusing them. 
Okay. 
SONJA: 
 I've been thrashing around 
 like I'm 35, 
instead of acting my age, 
but we have a doctor 
in our tribe-- uh, Sean-- 
and he did a wonderful job 
of bandaging me up. 
I think one of the problems 
 with aging 
is the thinning of the skin, 
 darn it, 
and so I think I'm maybe 
getting a little more banged up 
than some of the younger ones. 
My aim leaves something 
to be desired, 
but we're getting there. 
Try this? 
Well, I don't know. 
This is heavier. 
It might be 
 sharper, though.
Think so? 
I'm wondering 'cause
 that's so damn hard.
Well, that's off. 
That ain't gonna work. 
Here's a, uh, a therapist's 
 version of "Bye, Bye, Blues," 
if I can remember it. 
? Bye-bye blues ? 
? Thanks to Prozac ? 
? Bye-bye blues ? 
? Give me Paxil ? 
? Bells ring, birds sing ? 
? Sun is shining, 
 no more whining ? 
? I live through, 
 ba, da, da-da ? 
? Life is hell, but I'm swell ? 
? Bye-bye, bye blues. ? 
Yeah, that's awesome, awesome. 
Fantastic. 
RICHARD: 
 Well, the fish traps 
 were hanging from the boat 
that we were coming over here, 
and when we were 
 tossed into the sea on the raft
and we could take whatever 
 we could get our hands on, 
we grabbed 
 three or four fish traps 
and a bunch of rat traps, 
and so we stuck the rat traps 
 out the first night 
and boom-- we got a rat 
 in each of them. 
Bait. I want bait! 
Give me bait! 
I think he's just going 
to cut its head off. 
Ew! 
Oh, God! 
Oh, no way! 
( laughing ) 
Remember that knife. 
We're not using it 
for anything else. 
Oh, dude! 
RAMONA: 
 I didn't sleep at all. 
I mean, 
 we-we closed our eyes. 
We kept hearing noises 
and, like, clicking sounds, 
 and we're, like, okay. 
Um, what's his name... 
WOMAN:: 
Joel. 
Uh, Joel woke up, 
 a rat was, like, in his ear. 
JOEL: 
 I heard something squeaking 
 in my ear. 
A rat was trying 
 to get on the raft, 
or get near us 
 or get at something. 
I mean, everything was moving. 
B.B.: 
 We're just going 
 along the beach here 
and just identifying 
 whatever we can use 
for the shelter, the roof. 
And I'm a little irritated 
that none of the others 
are down here to help 
 carry stuff, but that's okay. 
We need... 
 we need five more of these. 
B.B.... 
He's a character, man. 
I don't think he likes me much. 
Just these. 
No, no, 
 you don't understand. 
I got to have this thought out 
 and positioned right. 
GRETCHEN: 
 He's right, Joel, 
or it's not going 
 to fit the frame. 
Joel, trust me. 
I'm not the 
 one bitching. 
I mean, I'm fine. 
Hey, don't be 
 talking to me 
about monkey
 business. 
I can't sleep, 
 so I'm usually up. 
...this being the width. 
B.B.: 
 We got a lot of lazy people 
if you want to know the truth. 
You can't do it all yourself. 
You know, I asked Colleen 
 to straighten this out for me 
and here it is. 
That's the only thing 
 she had to do today. 
You can't have lazy people. 
GRETCHEN: 
 He had been out there, 
 you know, all morning long 
and, um... you know, 
 it was hot. 
GRETCHEN: 
B.B., I thought we said 
that this was a time of day, 
we were going to be 
out of the sun. 
Well, but for some of us... 
 some of the people, 
it's been all day that way. 
Right, 
it's your turn. 
You tell me 
what you're doing here 
and I'll help you. 
You hold it up 
and I'll do it quick. 
I promise you, 
I'll do it quick. 
That, you know, 
that's the right
 way to do it, 
but we won't have 
 near enough line 
to build the roof 
 and do that 
if we do all this, 
in all fairness.
Anyway, don't 
 stop now, but...
I think we'll have plenty, 
and I'm going to roll that up 
for you, too. 
We can't, like, 
get burned out, though. 
I'm not burned out. 
I know, 
but you will be 
if you spend all day 
out in the sun. 
No, I never 
 get burned out. 
You don't know me. 
I don't know you, 
but I know human beings. 
Okay. 
I like working 
 as a hobby. 
Honest to God, 
how about 15 minutes though? 
Sit down for 15 minutes. 
Why? Yeah, but, 
 I want to get...
I want to get this thing 
 stabilized so at least... 
But, B.B., look... 
Let me just explain. 
I want to get this stabilized so
then people can come in here... 
You know the light cords 
 you got? 
And we can tie 
 these things down, 
but until I get this bounce 
 out of this... 
I want to... I'm going to put 
 a support there 
in the middle here 
 and right there. 
'Cause if not, we 
 got to take bounce 
 out of this. 
I just think we have 
plenty of time. 
I thought we were going 
to try to stay competitive, 
and if you work all day 
and you're burnt 
at the end of the day, 
we're not going to be 
competitive. 
Take a break, and if it bounces 
a little tonight, 
then we'll fix it tomorrow. 
I'm going to keep working, 
 sweetheart. 
You're going to get 
burned out. 
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are. 
You already are. 
B.B.: 
 Oh, my. 
You're doing fine. 
Too much paper. 
Yeah. 
Bifocals work? 
Bifocals worked.
You the man, B. 
No, she took 
 my bifocals... 
We're both the man. 
And made it happen. 
B.B.: 
 And the fire started 
because I had bought 
 a set of glasses with me. 
I was going to do it 
and Gretchen said, 
 "Why don't I do it? 
I know how to do it, too." 
 So, I said, "Great." 
Nice, guys. You guys 
 split up and everything. 
Amen. 
 Good work. 
B.B.: 
 And she took my glasses 
and started the fire. 
You did well, Gretch. 
If we get fire, 
it means we're going to have 
a hot meal in our stomach 
which is going to bring up 
 team morale. 
That first meal 
 might be rat soup, 
which I'm, like, 
 looking forward to very much 
because there's nothing wrong 
 with a rat. 
All a rat is, is a squirrel 
 without a fuzzy tail. 
Let's just work with this. 
Okay. 
I'm thinking, 
 if we could work with this, 
we're getting 
 a ton of smoke. 
Start that 
 piece of wood? 
 If we get a piece of bamboo, 
someone sits here and holds 
 the bamboo right here 
with the kindling in it. 
 With the kindling 
 in it. 
You know what I'm saying? 
Here we go. 
Come on, Dirk. 
Go big. 
This isn't 
 going to catch. 
Well, you want 
 to just keep trying? 
Why don't we try 
and make the bough? 
MAN: 
 Go...! 
Come on! 
 We're getting there! 
All right! Okay! 
Don't stop! 
Don't stop! 
There was smoke.
 We lost it. 
A lot of smoke. 
 Yeah. 
Don't you guys... 
Cool! 
How much more do we need? 
I don't know. 
How much more? 
That'll do it. 
You in, Rich? 
Here we go. 
 Here we go. 
Work it, Rich. 
Yeah. 
What? 
You guys get ready 
to take his spot. 
Take a break, man. 
We made a lot smoke but no fire.
I think it would have been nice
 if we had fire, 
but we're not going 
 to catch fish 
unless we have fire to cook it 
and I think that 
 if we had fire, 
we could have spent 
 a lot of time sitting 
around the bonfire 
 at night maybe singing songs. 
We have a ukulele, you know, 
and that didn't happen 
 and I wish it did. 
Throughout their time 
 on the island, 
the tribes will compete 
in a series of challenges. 
They'll receive messages 
notifying them 
 of these competitions 
at their tree mail. 
Today's challenge is 
 for both reward, 
in the form of 50 waterproof 
 matches, and immunity. 
Win immunity, you stay 
on the island a few days longer.
Lose, face Tribal Council, 
where you must vote one member 
 off the island. 
Ooh. 
A map to fire. 
It's got to be. 
"Cold food, dark camp, 
"just a reminder 
of your first night. 
It looks so easy 
in the book." Yes. 
"Why is it so hard to light? 
"Tonight your tribe 
will carry the torch. 
"One tribe takes
 home the flame. 
The other gives 
 someone the boot." 
Whoa! 
Whoa. 
I guess they're 
 combining the reward
and immunity challenge 
 this time. 
That's the competition 
is taking home the flame, 
but what's the competition? 
 We've got no freakin' idea. 
Welcome, tribes, 
 to your first challenge. 
Congratulations 
 on your first night 
on the island-- 
 should be very proud. 
I know both of 
 you guys have food. 
You found some 
 fresh water 
and I think, Pagong,
 you guys had fire. 
( cheers ) 
Right on. 
A lot of work to get fire. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it takes 
 a lot of work. 
With the threat of rain 
always a constant, 
even if you guys 
did have fire, 
you're certainly not back there 
 tending to them now. 
50 waterproof matches 
should certainly make that 
a lot easier. 
It's one of the things 
you're playing 
 for tonight-- the 
 other is this: 
I want everybody to touch this, 
 get a good feel of this. 
This is your life 
 on the island. 
This is the immunity idol. 
Oh. Ah. 
Win this, 
you stay on 
 the island a 
 few days longer.
Lose... 
you face 
tomorrow's Tribal Council, 
where one of
 you will be 
the first person 
voted off the island. 
Big enough stakes? 
Oh, yeah. 
Okay, here's what we're doing. 
There are two rafts 
about 150 feet 
 out in the water. 
Your job is to get your raft 
 back to the beach. 
Along the way, a series 
 of torches both in the water 
and on the land. 
First team to light 
 all their torches 
and their side of the fire 
 spirit wins immunity. 
Here are the rules: 
 Each tribe member 
has to have one 
 hand on the raft
at all times-- 
 at all times. 
Nobody can 
 swim ahead. 
Nobody can fall behind. 
The other rule: you have 
to light every torch. 
Don't put me in the position 
of having to make 
 a judgment call. 
I don't want to. 
There's too much at stake. 
Clear? 
ALL: 
 Clear. 
All right, 
swim out to your rafts. 
Wait for my signal. 
Okay, Sue, listen up. 
You're going to hold this. 
How's that feel 
 for you carrying? 
JEFF: 
 Here we go! 
A storm is approaching! 
Waterproof matches 
 and immunity at stake! 
Go! 
Go! 
 Here we go! 
Keep going. 
 You got to lift. 
Come on, team! 
Here we go! 
 Light it! Light it! 
Dry run it. 
Dry run it. 
Go, go, go! 
Slow it down. 
Go! 
Here we go. 
 Come on, y'all. 
 Come on. 
Do not wait for me. 
( all yelling ) 
No, no, no! 
Go. Go. We got it. 
Good job. 
Go! 
( all yelling ) 
Go! 
( all yelling ) 
Throw it! 
Go! Here we go! Come on! 
To the flag!
Calm down. 
Pick it up. 
 Pick it up. 
Here comes the wave.
Pick it up. 
 Pick it up. 
Let's go. 
Move it! Move it! 
 Move it! 
Move it, move 
 it, move it! 
Move it, move it, 
 move it! 
Make sure 
 you get it. 
Let's go! 
Here we go! 
Let's go! 
Stop! 
Come on, team! 
We're doing good. 
Three! 
Come on! 
Go! 
We're still there! 
 Seven! 
We're doing it, 
we're doing it, 
we're doing it. 
We're still there. 
Come on. 
Come on! 
 We're still there! 
We're still 
 there! 
We win! 
Going back! 
It's lit! It's lit! 
No, keep it there. 
We got it! 
Yay! 
Yay! 
Yeah, baby! 
( screaming ) 
Yes! 
JEFF: 
 Guys, great 
 competition.
Really close. 
Pagong, you get 
 fire in the form
of 50 waterproof
 matches. 
( team yelling ) 
And more 
 importantly... 
immunity from tomorrow's
 Tribal Council. 
You'll stay on the 
 island a few more days. 
Yes! 
 This is happening 
 every time! 
Every time, this
 is happening! 
Every time! 
JEFF: 
 Tagi. 
That's why 
 we're winning. 
We're going to stay... 
Our island! 
Tagi. 
Nice competition. 
You know the drill. 
You have a date 
 with me tomorrow 
 for the Tribal Council, 
where one of
 you will be 
the first person
 voted off. 
You guys seen Dirk? 
Where the hell did he go? 
Oh, he goes... 
 He brought his bible with him? 
Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
I think he's 
 pretty religious. 
He was telling me he was 
 a youth minister or something. 
( reading quietly ) 
Rain's coming. 
Again? 
That's all right. 
I could always use 
a wash. 
RUDY: 
 Before we got 
 on the island here, 
I formed opinions 
 about people, 
but I changed my mind 
 just on that trip in. 
Rich, for one. 
I mean, this guy is... 
 He's strong. 
He's smart. 
The guy surprises me. 
You know, he's fat, but he's... 
( chuckling ): 
 he's good. 
You can lay it 
 over those. 
RICHARD: 
 I like Rudy. 
I'm not bothered 
by his straightforwardness 
 at all. 
I don't think 
it's even a problem. 
I-I like it that he's saying 
"Hey, do this," 
 or, "Hey, do that," 
but people are thinking of that
 as very direct and arrogant. 
That's the word I'm hearing, 
 and I'm thinking to myself 
"Well, they think he's arrogant;
 Oh, my God, I'm out of here!" 
( thuds ) 
Oh, my gosh. 
What do we got? 
The good news is 
 we'll be having fire tonight. 
The bad news is 
 one of us won't be 
 here to enjoy it. 
We got Tribal Council tonight. 
"Pack your bags, 
get ready to go, 
which one it will be, 
the world will soon know." 
KELLY: 
 Unfortunately, we're going 
 to have to vote somebody off. 
There's going to be 
 a lot of tension 
and one of us is going to leave.
Well, what time we 
 got to do this at? 
It just said, 
"Get ready to go." 
Just, "Pack your bags, 
 get ready to go." 
I can't believe 
 we have to pack up. 
We're just getting settled. 
Well, somebody's gone. 
So, it's time to think 
about who are they going 
 to vote for? 
Why are they going to vote? 
I've narrowed it down to four. 
I'm one of them. 
Well, it could mean a lot 
uh, either staying 
 or being voted out. 
You know, 
 last night's competition, 
I really feel responsible 
 because I couldn't keep up 
and I was dragged totally 
 off my feet. 
I do feel that that stumble 
 probably cost us 
the immunity challenge, 
 and that's a big one. 
Up until, uh, 
 probably last night, 
I never gave it 
 a second thought 
about who I was going 
 to vote off 
or if I got voted off, 
 but after last night, uh... 
I thought about it then, 
 and I decided then. 
I feel pretty secure, actually, 
 about the vote tonight. 
Kelly and I get along 
 real well 
and we've been talking 
about strategy, and, you know, 
 who's not contributing 
as much, and who would be best 
 to vote off, 
and I think we-we've come 
 to a mutual decision 
and we've talked to Sue 
 about it. 
Stacey came up to me, 
 and it's, like, 
she don't like Rudy 
and she's, like, 
"Oh, I think we're going 
 to vote for Rudy," 
and vote him off 
 'cause he's so barking." 
Well, anybody's too barking 
 and too bossy to Stacey 
because she doesn't 
 move her ass. 
The chicks think I'm voting 
 for one person, and I'm not. 
This is Tribal Council, 
 where each week 
one member will be voted 
 off the island. 
Last night, 
 in a crushing defeat 
Tagi lost the immunity 
 challenge, 
so, tonight, they will come here
 and vote the first person off. 
It all begins 
 with a dangerous hike 
through the jungle. 
With so little time 
 to get acquainted, 
everyone is vulnerable. 
Rich's talk-versus-action 
 approach 
may be more annoying 
 than helpful. 
Sonja's tumble 
 cost them dearly. 
One thing's for certain: 
At Tribal Council, 
 you are held accountable 
for your actions. 
There will be a vote. 
Someone is going home. 
I see torches. 
Oh, that looks 
 pretty hairy. 
( birds chirping ) 
( gong sounds ) 
Make our way around. 
We begin 
 Tribal Council 
with a ritual. 
Behind each of you is a torch. 
I'd like you to grab the torch 
 and approach the fire. 
Go ahead and 
 dip your torches
in the flame 
 and light them. 
Put them back in their 
 slot, and take a seat. 
We do this because--
as I'm sure 
 you've discovered-- 
on the island, 
 fire represents life. 
These torches now represent 
 your life, your identity 
here at 
 Tribal Council. 
The good news is
you will take these torches 
 with you when you leave 
so you will have fire, 
and you will bring them 
 back with you 
to each Tribal Council. 
Go ahead and
 have a seat.
Well, leave it to me 
 to state the obvious, 
but this is not a 
 place you want to be. 
You tread in dangerous territory
every time you come here. 
Tribal Council 
 is basically 
where you account 
 for your actions 
 on the island. 
Some of 
 those actions 
will come back 
 to help you. 
Some of them may come 
 back to haunt you, 
but tonight, based 
 on those actions, 
one of you will be 
 the first person 
 voted off the island. 
So, before we 
 get to the vote,
let's talk about 
 what's been going on. 
I'm curious 
just about you guys getting here
and finding this place. 
How was the 
 journey over here? 
Saw two deadly snakes. 
Really? 
SUSAN: 
Grand Canyon 
mud slides... 
It was great. 
It was fun. 
We're still starving. 
We've eaten 
but not really. 
SONJA: 
The competition 
is stiffer. 
The competition 
we had last night was tough, 
tougher than I had anticipated. 
How are you holding up, 
 physically? 
SONJA: 
Well, pretty well, 
you know. 
I'll fight to the finish, 
 but, uh, I have my blisters 
and whatnot, 
 but I'm-I'm doing okay. 
What happened 
 after Quest for Fire? 
That was a great competition-- 
obviously, 
 a lot at stake. 
SONJA: 
 Oh, God.
We came close. 
We almost got it. 
SUSAN: 
Aw, man, we were 
dragged down two times 
and we were right there. 
We almost got it. 
SUSAN: 
There's no way. 
All right, guys, well... 
it's obviously a fun group. 
This is not 
 a pleasant process... 
No, not at all. 
JEFF: 
 And I know also,
 from listening 
to you guys talk, 
 that there are 
a lot of different 
 reasons why you're here.
Obviously, $1 million-- 
 big motivator for anybody, 
but I'm sensing 
there could be 
 personal reasons, 
different journeys 
 you might be on 
that-that this 
 encompasses. 
Whatever it is, 
to fulfill 
 that agenda,
you have to survive 
 tonight's Tribal Council. 
That's the way it's set up. 
So, what we're 
 going to do is vote 
and how it 
 will work is
you'll come 
 down here. 
You'll go across
 this bridge 
into our voting 
 confessional. 
Write the name of the person 
 you want to vote off-- 
large, clear letters. 
Hold it up, 
 and speak your piece. 
We can't hear you. 
Fold it up, put it 
 in the container, 
come back, and 
 take a seat. 
Now, once the votes are tallied,
 the decision is final 
and you have to leave 
the Tribal Council 
 area immediately. 
It's time to vote. 
You're first. 
I'll do the best I can. 
Got to remove the weakest link 
 in the... crew. 
Stacey. 
Um, tough call. 
( sighs ) 
Subtle reasons... 
I'm not sure 
 exactly what they are. 
He's just... 
He's an ornery guy... 
doesn't really help that much. 
For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know
 how to start fire... 
and he 
 just criticizes everything. 
I'm picking her 
because I think she's the reason
 we lost yesterday. 
I'll miss his, uh, skills 
and, um, 
 his speaking his mind openly. 
Before I read these votes, 
I just want to commend you 
on the courage it's 
 taken to get this far. 
There were a lot of 
 steps along the way.
Any of you could've 
 turned around. 
Nobody did, 
 and in my book 
that gives you bragging 
 rights for life. 
So, with that, 
 I'll read the votes.
First vote-- Sonja. 
Sonja. 
Stacey. 
Sonja. 
Rudy. 
Rudy. 
Rudy. 
That's three
 for Sonja 
and three for Rudy. 
The first person
voted off the island... 
Sonja. 
Sonja, I need you 
 to grab your torch 
and bring 
 it to me. 
The tribe 
 has spoken. 
Go get 'em, you guys. 
RICH: 
Thanks, Sonja. 
Thanks. 
 Thank you. 
It's time for 
 you to go. 
JEFF: 
 Well, to the rest 
 of you, I guess 
a somber 
 congratulations.
You've survived 
 the Tribal Council. 
You have fire. 
You can head back to camp 
and I will see you tomorrow 
 for the next challenge. 
Good night. 
JEFF: 
 Next week, on Survivor... 
I've been 
working my ass off 
and a lot of you have been 
laying on your ass watching me. 
Don't give me any of that .... 
RUDY: 
 Me and Richard got to be 
 pretty good friends-- 
not in a homosexual way, 
 that's for sure. 
( screaming and laughing ) 
Swallow it, Gervase!
Well, I think this has been, 
uh, an awesome experience. 
Being the first to be voted out
 is a little humiliating. 
On the other hand, 
 the team did the right thing. 
They're a terrific group 
 of people. 
They're very strong physically,
and I-I think in their shoes, 
I'd probably do the same thing.
