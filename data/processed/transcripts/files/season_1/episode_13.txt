         JEFF PROBST: 
 36 Days ago on this 
 remote Malaysian island 
16 Americans began 
 the adventure of a lifetime. 
Woo-hoo! 
They became castaways 
leaving behind their jobs, 
 their loved ones, 
and all contact 
 with civilization. 
Their goal: work together 
 to build a new world, 
but compete against each other 
 to become the sole survivor 
and win $1 million. 
It was to become 
 the ultimate human experiment. 
We have to function together 
 or we fail. 








I'm a redneck, and I don't know 
 corporate world at all, 
and corporate world ain't going 
 to work out here in the bush. 
B.B.: 
 I've been working my ass off, 
 and a lot of you 
have been laying 
on your ass, watching me. 
So don't give me 
 any of that ... 
RUDY: 
 The hardest part is 
hanging around 
 with all these young kids. 
I don't even know 
what MTV means, you know? 
JEFF: 
 At first, 
 the castaways competed 
as two separate tribes: 
 Pagong and Tagi. 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
JEFF: 
 Every third night 
the losing tribe would hike 
 deep into the jungle 








to take part in Tribal Council 
 where they had 
to vote one of their own 
 off the island. 
Three castaways from Pagong 
 and three from Tagi 
met their untimely fate 
 in these first 18 days. 
On day 21, the tribes merged 
and the competitions 
 became individual. 
Yes! 
As the numbers dwindled 
the stakes grew higher 
 and alliances were promised. 
So, are we going
 to stick to it? 
I'm going 
to stick to it. 
You, me and Gervase could 
definitely do something. 
So, let's do it. 
So, now it's you and me
 to the end, period. 
JEFF: 
 But as strategies deepened, 
 bonds were broken. 
'Cause I trust her more
 than I trust you. 
Why? That's bull ... 
I've been your friend 
since day one. 
JEFF: 
 At last week's Tribal Council, 
 Sean was voted off. 
Now, only four remain, 
 but tonight 
one of these castaways 
 will make it 
through the last three 
 Tribal Councils 
and become the sole survivor. 
RICHARD: 
 Time is kind of out of my head.
I don't have a clock 
or a calendar 
 or a watch or anything, 
but for some reason, 
 I feel really, really 
comfortable, really good now. 
I, um, I think it has 
 to do with just how short... 
how little time is left. 
SUSAN: 
 We're down to 60 hours. 
So, 60 hours, 
 if you look at it that way, 
I can deal with it for a chance
 to win a million dollars, 
but the hardest thing 
for me here now has come down 
 to probably the boredom. 
It's peach fuzz. 
Scrape it off.
RUDY: 
 The girls got razor blades 
 in their care package, 
so after they got done 
 under their arms 
they shaved my face. 
Looks great. 
Cool. 
Just like uptown. 
Yeah, you look great. 
KELLY: 
 Hey, Rudy, clean shaven. 
How's it feel? 
Man, I was dying to 
 get rid of that thing.
We made about, uh... 
200 pots of rice 
 since we've been here. 
Sometimes we ate 
 three times a day, 
sometimes twice a day, 
sometimes once a day. 
I'd say I lost 22 pounds 
 since I've been here. 
How much do we got 
here, Rudy? 
Like, three-quarters 
of a bowl each? 
Yeah. 
It's getting down 
 to the wire, eh? 
I'm a wreck. 
My hair is way longer 
 than I ever keep it. 
This feels like a mop. 
There's nothing left. 
I used to have 
 a muscle here growing. 
I think I've lost 
 a good 30 pounds 
since getting here, 
 but everything's loose. 
There's nothing that's firm 
 on this body anymore. 
Basically, I'm a physical wreck.
KELLY: 
 I'm completely covered 
 in bug bites from head to toe. 
I've lost some weight. 
I've lost some muscle. 
I've lost quite a hunk 
 of sanity. 
Gosh, I don't think I thought 
this was going to be as mental 
 as it ended up being. 
SUSAN: 
 What's it like 
 living with somebody 
you don't care for 
 at the time... 
sleeping next to your enemy? 
You just do it. 
You just hang out with them 
 and eat next to them, 
and just treat them 
 like a civil person. 
That's all you can do. 
RUDY: 
 Of the four of us 
 that are here right now 
we formed this alliance 
 way in the beginning, 
and, you know, we were 
 in a position of power 
where we could get rid 
 of anybody we wanted to-- 
we had 'em lined up-- 
but now we're finished 
 with the alliance 
'cause the four of us are left, 
 so you're on your own. 
I was really shocked 
 in the beginning 
by how few people were planning.
It seemed a vacation 
to 16 people who were told 
what this was about, 
who saw the logo that said 
"Out wit, Out play, Out last," 
 same as I did. 
In the beginning, 
 nobody wanted the money, 
but now it's all money. 
You know, 
it's on everybody's mind. 
And in order to win the money 
you got to make an alliance 
 or don't even show up. 
RICHARD: 
 When we got to the point 
 where the original four 
were still here 
 as the final four, 
that alliance had 
gone through 
 a number of machinations 
that changed it 
 from being the original four 
to almost anybody's game. 
KELLY: 
 I feel like I agreed to be 
 in an alliance, 
and then I didn't want to be 
 in it anymore, 
but I was too chicken 
 to tell 'em that. 
And I tried to play both sides;
I tried to vote 
 how I wanted to vote 
do what I thought was right, 
but not let them in on it, 
because, hell, I want 
 to stay in the game. 
After Gretchen, she didn't vote 
 in any of the way 
the alliance voted. 
She was setting herself up 
so that if she is the last two 
 at the end 
she's going to make herself 
 look really good, 
'cause we knew there would be 
more Pagong on the jury 
 than Tagi. 
KELLY: 
 I just bit off 
way more than I could chew 
and it just... it all exploded. 
SUSAN: 
 What it is is greedy. 
She thinks she got... 
 like, five or six people ago, 
it's like, you could see 
 her turn a little bit. 
Then I was really irritated. 
This has not been easy, 
 you know, 
come out here on the island 
 and get bit up by bugs 
and stung by stingrays. 
So I told Kelly 
my family's 
 my number-one goal. 
I think I got a better chance 
 of winning the million dollars 
with arrogant Rich by my side 
 than with her at my side. 
RICHARD: 
 Had Sue not informed me 
that she had broken the alliance
and established one with Kelly, 
I never would have known it 
and the two of them would have 
 easily undermined me, 
and I could have gone 
 at any point 
if they'd maintained 
 that alliance. 
So it's kind of neat, 
 cute, nice, 
that the final four were 
 the initial four, 
but it wasn't a continuous line
of "Ooh, initial four make it 
 all the way through." 
So there's a different feeling 
 attached to it, 
not that sense of 
 accomplishment I would have had
had the trust been unbreached 
 and we went through cleanly. 
Message, message, 
message, ooh. 
"'Ode to the fallen comrades': 
"Here are your targets 
from Tribal Councils past. 
"Hope you've learned 
about the people you've sacked. 
Come to the next challenge 
 with all your bags packed." 
Oh! How cool-- like, 
 about their personality.
RUDY: 
 Somebody will go tonight 
and we're waiting 
 till after we get back to eat 
so we got more food, 
 'cause one mouth will be gone. 
Could be mine; 
 could be anybody's. 
I think maybe 
 this challenge will be 
they'll ask questions 
 about each person-- 
maybe how old they were, 
 what they do for a living-- 
which I don't know 
 and I don't care. 
Rudy was just asking
 what Sean did again.
Rudy won't do very well. 
I think it's going 
to be questions 
about, um, these people-- 
seeing how well we knew them, 
how well we listened to them. 
I guess things like that. 
SUSAN: 
 It's cutthroat time. 
I would say that Rich, Rudy 
 and I are getting along well, 
and, uh, Kelly's the one we've 
been wanting to get out of here.
KELLY: 
 I feel completely vulnerable. 
I feel the odd man out. 
It's really stressful 
 and it's kind of scary because,
you know, 
 I'm not "safe" anymore. 
( whistling ) 
RUDY: 
 Kelly would have been gone 
 by now if she didn't ace 
the last two immunities. 
SUSAN: 
 We're praying that one of us 
 three wins today 
so we can boot her out. 
The one person I did 
 actually care about was Sue 
and she doesn't give 
 two ... about me, 
so I don't give a crap 
 about anybody 
on this island anymore. 
Um, I'm here for me 
and everybody else 
 can kiss my ass. 
( gong ringing ) 
JEFF: 
 We'll go ahead 
 and bring our jury in. 
Day 37... 
down to two
 immunity 
 challenges.
We've invited 
the jury in 
because what we're going 
to do tonight embodies 
what Survivor's all about. 
The game is called 
 "Fallen Comrades." 
It's a simple quiz game 
 to find out 
how much you've learned 
about the other castaways 
while you've been here. 
We're going to ask you 
 ten questions. 
There's one point 
for each answer 
 you get correct.
The person with the most points 
 at the end of the game 
wins immunity. 
Immediately following, 
 we'll hold a vote. 
Make sense? 
Okay. 
Question one: 
"Who received only one vote 
 at the first Tribal Counsel?" 
Okay. 
Turn it over. 
We're doing these one by one. 
See everybody's vote. 
"Stacey." 
One for Rudy, 
 one for Sue. 
Now your answers are 
 suddenly valuable, Rudy.
I know it. They're all peeking 
 over my shoulder. 
JEFF: 
 Here's the second question: 
"In Treasure Island Relay 
"name the Pagong members 
"who ran the following 
 legs of that event: 
"Number one is 
 The Swimming Leg; 
"number two, 
 The Floating Bridge; 
"number three, The Paddle; 
"number four, The Run; 
number five, 
 Who Did the Dig?" 
Okay. Turn them around,
 we'll go one by one. 
The Swim was Colleen. 
Number two, The Floating 
 Bridge was Greg. 
The Paddler was Joel. 
The Runner was Gervase. 
And the last, The Dig, 
 there were two people: 
Gretchen and Jenna.
One for Sue.
One for Richard.
One for Kelly.
Okay, question three: 
"Of the former castaways, 
whose shirt is this?" 
That's a 
 good idea.
Rudy, all right.
Five seconds. 
Okay. 
Kelly's right.
It was Jenna's.
Okay, Kelly and Sue
 tied in the lead 
with two each.
Question four: 
"What state is
 Gervase from?"
"What state 
 is Gervase from?" 
Okay, let's reveal.
"New Jersey." 
"New Jersey"
 is right. 
Sue, Rich and Rudy
 each get a point. 
Sue is in the lead.
You're off to 
 a good start. 
Question five:
"Whose blue bandanna is this?" 
Blue bandanna. 
All right, reveal.
"Greg" is right.
Kelly is the only 
 person with the 
 right answer. 
Sue and Kelly in
 the lead, three 
 points each. 
Question six: 
"What are the names 
 of these two girls?" 
Five seconds, guys.
Okay, won't waste it. 
Flip around.
"No idea."
 "No idea."
"Sabrina..."
That's their middle names. 
"...and Sadie."
 Both right. 
Kelly, moving out 
into a lead. 
We have four 
 questions left.
Question seven:
"Other than the raft 
 and personal belongings,
"what three items did 
 Pagong bring with them
when they moved
 to Tagi Beach?"
You need 
all three items. 
Still writing,
 Rudy? Okay. 
Let's reveal. 
The answers were
 "mosquito net," 
"cooking pot" 
 and "a blanket."
Rudy, you're right.
"Blanket, mosquito
 net, cooking pot."
Kelly, you're right.
So it's Rudy, 
Kelly, Sue. 
Each get one point. 
All right, we have 
 three questions left. 
Kelly in the lead.
 Question eight: 
"Name the two survivors 
from Pagong who did not compete 
in the obstacle course?" 
Five seconds, 
 Richard. 
Okay. 
Let's see what you have.
"Gervase and Colleen."
"Gervase and
 Colleen." 
"Gervase and Colleen."
That's right. 
Rudy, Kelly, Sue. 
Wrong again, Richard. 
Okay, Kelly in 
 the lead with six.
Sue, close behind 
 with five. 
Rudy, you have four.
Question nine: 
 "Sean was the chief resident 
of what department 
 in the hospital?" 
"Sean was the chief resident 
 of what department 
in the hospital?" 
Okay. 
Flip. 
"Neurology."
 "Neurology."
"Maternity."
"Neurology."
Okay, everybody
 but Kelly. 
Okay, last question: 
Sue and Kelly are 
 both tied at six. 
Rudy, you got five.
This could determine
 the winner 
in who gets immunity. 
But if Kelly and Sue
 both get it wrong 
and, Rudy, if you 
 get it right, 
then we'll have 
 a three-way tie,
in which case we'll 
 go to a tie-breaker.
Okay, here we go. 
Last question:
"In order, list the survivors 
voted off the Pagong Tribe." 
Okay, let's reveal.
This is for immunity. 
Number one was B.B.
Ramona was second. 
Number three was Joel. 
Number four, Gretchen. 
Number five, Greg. 
Six was Jenna. 
Gervase. 
Colleen. 
Sue, Richard and Kelly 
do get credit. 
Okay, that was 
 our last question.
We have a tie between 
 Kelly and Sue. 
This is our 
tie-breaker question: 
"What is Sonja's last name?" 
She was in your tribe. 
"What is Sonja's last name?" 
You have five 
 seconds, Sue. 
Let's reveal. 
This is for immunity. 
Sue, you 
 don't know.
Kelly, "Christopher"
 is right. 
Kelly, well done. 
Immunity... 
four in a row to Kelly. 
You are on a hot
 streak for sure.
Do you pay attention 
 to people usually 
and learn about them? 
I do. I listen. 
Uh, I listen to people, 
and I especially listen, 
um, when it's people 
 I'm interested in 
and people I like. 
Okay. It's time to vote. 
Rich, you're up. 
Who knows why? 
JEFF: 
 Rudy? 
Her number was up. 
It's time for Rich to get... 
 off the stage. 
Sue?
I'll go tally the votes. 
As always, once the votes are 
 tallied, the decision is final 
and you'll be 
 asked to leave
the Tribal 
 Council area
 immediately.
( sighs ) 
"Sue." 
"Rich."
"Sue."
That's two 
 votes for Sue 
one vote for Rich.
"Rich."
Our first tie. 
Okay, so what 
has already been a long day 
 and a long night 
is going to get a little longer.
Here's how a tiebreaker works. 
Rich and Sue 
 will not vote.
Kelly and Rudy 
 will vote again
but before
 we do that
I want to give each of you 
 30 seconds 
to make a 
 plea for why
whoever voted for you 
should change 
 their vote. 
So, Rich, I'll 
 start with you.
Um... 
Well, Kells Bells, 
somebody's got to go. 
I'd appreciate your vote, 
 not against me. 
Um, I'd love to stay. 
I think, uh, it's been 
 an interesting road, 
to say the least, 
as it gets 
more and more real 
down to these days, 
like some people may never know.
We worked well together, 
and I think, uh, I have 
 a certain responsibility 
for pulling the alliance 
 together from the beginning. 
These are the four 
we started with 
and, uh, I'd ask 
for your help. 
Love you, Sue. 
Me, too.
( Rich chuckles ) 
JEFF: 
 Sue? 
Okay. 
Rudy... 
I'm not going to say anything. 
I'm just leaving it 
 the way it is. 
You know me.
You know how I 
 operate, whatever.
Whatever you want to do. 
Rudy, 
you're up.
Take this 
 with you. 
Same reason. 
JEFF: 
 Okay, Kelly.
I'm going to go 
 tally the votes again. 
You guys have been through 
 a lot. 
Let's do this. 
Two votes;
one of you will be leaving 
 the Tribal Council area. 
First vote... 
"Sue."
Second vote... 
"Sue."
RICHARD: 
Thanks, sweetie. 
Cool. Hey, no problem. 
I'm ready to go. 
You need to bring 
 me your torch. 
( Sue laughing ): 
 You... 
Have a smoke and coffee. 
Okay. 
( chuckling ) 
Okay. That works. 
The tribe 
 has spoken.
Okay. I'll see you guys later. 
It's time 
 for you to go.
Good-bye. 
You guys need to 
 go get some sleep.
The last immunity 
 challenge is tomorrow.
I'll be waking you up.
I'll see you guys back at camp. 
SUE: 
 Oh, I appreciate being able 
 to talk to everybody 
for the last time. 
I said, "Oh, it'd be great 
if I could finish 
in the top four or five." 
I finished top four. 
Hey, that's good enough for me. 
You know, 
 outside of the weather 
and being cold and rainy 
 when it rained at night, 
and the sand fleas, 
 this was a lot easier for me 
than driving a truck through 
 Chicago every day of the week. 
Th-that's a lot worse 
than being out here in the bush.
JEFF: 
 Kelly, Rich and Rudy 
are all that remain 
 of the Rattana Tribe. 
Still to come: 
 two more Tribal Councils 
and we'll find out 
 who will be the sole survivor. 
Rich? Kelly?
Hey, it's Jeff.
RICHARD: 
Oh... yes, so it is. 
Morning, morning. 
Let me give you 
 a little morning
 light here. 
Put on something comfortable. 
Rudy, when you're ready, 
 come on over and join us. 
The end is near. 
You ready to go, Rudy?
Got a long boat ride 
 ahead of us. 
( bird screeches ) 
JEFF: 
 Today, this moment 
 really is for you guys. 
It is the final
 rite of passage
of this whole 
 Survivor experience. 
At the other end 
 of the sand spit 
is the final 
 immunity challenge. 
To get there 
you must first walk through 
 these palm fronds. 
The natives are chanting 
"sandovar"-- 
 spirit is around you. 
Then you all must pass 
 the staffs 
of your fallen comrades. 
As you go, take a moment 
 to reflect on them. 
You'll then pass through 
 the bamboo curtain 
and walk barefoot 
 across a fire pit 
where the embers are burning 
 at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For 38 days, this island, 
 sometimes a paradise, 
and sometimes a nightmare, 
has embraced you 
 as one of its own. 
We have some mud 
 from the mud volcano. 
But I think it's important 
 that a little piece 
of the island goes with you 
 on this experience. 
( chanting ): 
 Sandovar! Sandovar! Sandovar! 
JEFF: 
 There have been so many steps 
 along the way 
that you've stepped through 
 one door into another area. 
What we want this to be, right 
 now, is a way for you guys 
to take everything that you've 
 become over the last 38 days 
and channel it 
 into one powerful experience. 
This challenge
 is very simple
in its nature 
 and its execution.
We're calling it 
 "Hands on the Immunity Idol" 
and the challenge is 
 to simply keep your hand 
on that idol as long as you can.
The last person remaining 
 with a hand on the idol 
wins immunity going 
 into tonight's vote. 
( screeches ) 
( screeches ) 
So, although you can't move 
 your hands, 
you can lift your feet, 
just don't let your hand 
 come off of this. 
Good luck to you guys. 
 Hang in there 
as long as you can. 
The last person standing 
 gets immunity. 
And we are now beginning. 
RICHARD: 
 I have a request 
for "69 Bottles of Beer." 
Anybody? Others? 
What would your wife
 think right now 
if she could... if she
 could have a picture 
 in here of you 
in this mud 
 volcano war paint 
holding the 
 piece of wood?
Walking through fire. 
Walking through fire. 
She'd probably shake 
 her head as usual 
and walk away, you know. 
"He's doing something 
dumb again," you know? 
Do you think she would walk 
 through the fire, Rudy? 
Would she? 
Uh-huh. 
Yeah, if I told her to. 
I'd tell her it's a lot 
 of fun, you know, 
and she'll do it. 
Yeah, she seems to like 
 to do all, you know, 
she skydives and stuff 
 with him. 
Do you know Rudy's
 wife's name? 
Marge.
Very good.
I had no idea, 
 whatsoever, 
what your wife's name was 
 and then it hits me. 
( yawns ) 
Hour and a half, 
90 minutes. 
Already, I know. 
You're doing 
a lot better. 
It looks like maybe 
the first 15 or 20 minutes 
you weren't sure, 
but now you guys look 
like you've settled in 
for a while. 
RUDY: 
 Well, it ain't 
 tingling as much now. 
Sooner or later 
I'm going to have 
to step away 
and get some lunch 
and I just want... 
I don't blame you.
I'd get 
 breakfast first.
Put it right down here. 
Oh, don't even try 
and grab it. 
We can't hold it? 
Take a whiff. 
Take a whiff. 
I thought we could 
just hold it. 
No. You know, when
 you're finished 
they'll be here for you. 
How about if we hold them 
without eating them? 
Yeah, that'd be nice, 
 but, uh... 
I keep getting that inspiration 
from the smell. 
You don't 
 want to smell?
They smell... 
I know what 
oranges smell like. 
RUDY: 
You don't like 
oranges, huh? 
Oh-ho-ho...
you don't know 
 what these oranges
 smell like. 
I don't need to. 
You're sure?
Permeate your soul?
Nah. I'm thinking 
oatmeal, Jeff. 
I'll just put 
yours here, Rich. 
I think it's time 
for a speech. 
Okay, Rich, 
 let's have it. 
I'm thinking 
I'm probably never 
going to outlast 
you, Kelly. 
I'm going to hope 
that either one of you 
just recognize 
 what I've done to get here. 
Si, senor. 
I wish you both luck. 
Rich! 
Oh, my gosh! 
I thought you were
 going to make 
 a long speech? 
Not long. 
I said, "a speech." 
This game is about 
a lot of different things, 
and one of those things is 
mental strategy, 
and I thought to myself, 
"It's doubtful that I would 
 outlast Kelly 
"because she just stands there 
"until the cows come home, 
period. 
"And it doesn't mean 
I'm giving up a million dollars 
necessarily." 
How come? 
It means that 
whoever is immune 
 has to pick 
between the other 
two people 
as to who goes to the jury. 
Each of them could, 
50-50, pick me. 
I really can't tell. 
Even if I am somebody 
that she'd be better up against 
I don't know that 
she would do that, 
and even if Rudy's been loyal 
the entire time, 
I don't know that he'd continue 
to be so. 
I think so. 
It's all a game of odds, 
and who knows 
what somebody's 
 going to actually do. 
Thirsty, Rich? 
Oh, thank you, Jeff. 
Since you're out 
of the game. 
Appreciate that. 
Lemon, even. 
Just for when you guys 
finish up. 
I'll just put 'em 
over here. 
Thanks, Jeff. 
With your orange slices. 
Thank you. 
Absolutely.
Don't take your hand
 off the idol. 
But step down off 
 the logs. 
So think about this 
before you do it. 
Get a good grip on it. 
What you're going to do 
is rotate positions. 
We're going to do that 
every 30 minutes. 
Rudy, you walk 
to where Kelly's at 
and vice versa. 
You'll have 
to reposition, exactly. 
Were you surprised to see 
 Kelly change her vote? 
It's about what's in 
 your best interest. 
We all four joined 
an alliance. 
Okay. 
And Sue and Kelly joined 
a sub-alliance. 
Against you guys? 
Yeah... to get to the top. 
 Okay. 
Sue and I had 
formed an alliance to go... 
Which makes sense. 
Suballiances developing. 
But for Sue to flip-flop 
again and come tell me... 
Right. 
 Undermines Kelly... 
Right.
Undermines her trust. 
I did trust her 
 earlier in the game 
and I knew better. 
I knew better 
 not to really trust anybody, 
and I did and I got burned. 
Me, too. 
So she and I
 had spoke, 
also earlier, about getting 
 to the final vote, 
the final three, 
and she said, "Well, 
 I'm not going to let you 
to get down to the final three."
And you don't tell me 
 you're not going 
to let me do something 
 or I can't do something. 
Right. 
And then after I won that 
immunity after the mask, 
she was, "Hey, are we still 
this, this, that and the other?"
And I said, 
 "What's this 'we' ... ?" 
All of a sudden. 
All of sudden, you know, 
I won and she was buddy-buddy 
 with me again. 
When Sue went behind my back 
and made an alliance with Kelly 
I went immediately to Rudy, 
'cause there were 
 only four of us-- 
Sue and Kelly were in 
an alliance against me-- 
I went to Rudy, 
who I thought I could trust 
and said, "Rudy, are you still 
open to that alliance? 
Here's what happened 
 from the beginning." 
I had one with Sue 
it's why I couldn't promise 
 you I'd make one with you...
JEFF: 
Right. 
"You want to make one?" 
And that got you 
 to the final four. 
Final two. 
With him it was 
to the final two. 
Let me just throw an idea out 
that just occurred to me. 
When you said earlier 
that you guys 
 had the alliance, 
maybe the strongest one.
Yet you just kind of hopped 
 out of this game 
well over two hours ago, 
Uh-huh. 
leaving Rudy 
 to carry the ball 
for at least six, seven, 
 15, 20 hours. 
I didn't think 
 it would go this long. 
You effectively organized 
 a quit on this one; 
"You know what? 
 I can't do it. 
"I'm just gonna say, 
 'Rudy, you owe me, man. 
I'm going 
 to sit here...'"
I don't even think 
he owes me. 
But he gave me his word. 
What he does with that-- 
 Well, okay.
and it's a game-- 
 I'm not going to hate the man 
if he changes his mind. 
 But, you know... 
 Right. 
Or if he gets tired 
 in the sun. 
Right. 
Or if he gets 
tired in the sun. 
That's a problem
 you're in. 
This really is
 your alliance,
but now it's out of your hands. 
It is out 
of my hands. 
For the first time, 
 it's out of your hand. 
I took that chance 
and if I'm third, okay. 
Does it bother you 
 that he's sitting there 
and dropped out 
early? 
Yeah, I ought to be 
 sitting there. 
I'm going to force him
 to stand up here. 
I know. 
JEFF: 
 Yeah. He didn't give
 you that option. 
Yeah, by him jumping off, 
 it changes everything again. 
Yeah. 
'Cause I was 
 planning on him
 to do this. 
To continue this one? 
Yeah, and I knew I couldn't. 
Swap. 
He took 
 his hand off. 
I think that's that, Rudy. 
Well, I'm done. 
Nice job. 
Nice job. 
Nice job, Rudy.
Hug time. 
Oh, give me
 a hug. 
There you go. 
Five in a row. 
That's a record.
KELLY: 
 I knew a 100% 
the only way that I 
 was going to get to 
day 38 and now tomorrow, day 39,
was with this little thing 
 around my neck. 
RICHARD: 
 The last immunity challenge 
 was standing there 
attached to a... an idol. 
I thought... 
ugh... no chance in hell 
 of me doing that 
given who I was up against. 
I felt I was forcing the game 
 to go on unnecessarily. 
KELLY: 
 So Rich just gave 
 a little speech and said 
"I hope you appreciate what 
I'm doing for the both of you," 
and let go, which I thought 
 was kind of funny, like... 
he was tired, his arm hurt, 
 he wanted to let go 
and he was trying to make 
some big noble sacrifice 
for me and Rudy-- 
 yeah, whatever. 
RICHARD: 
 'Cause even if 
 I'm voted off tonight 
I think it's the best decision 
 I could have made. 
KELLY: 
 You know, it's out of my hands.
So when I won today 
it was just like, "Okay, 
"that's it, chill out, 
 relax, breathe... sleep, 
whatever you got to do." 
Um... so it was 
 just unbelievable. 
Overwhelming sense of relaxation
 and, uh, relief. 
RUDY: 
 Dumb. 
It was a dumb move on my part. 
I gave away a million bucks. 
I would have won a million bucks
if, uh, if I, uh, stayed there, 
didn't let go of it. 
It ain't nobody's fault 
 but mine. 
KELLY: 
 I'm nervous. 
I'm not nervous 
 about the vote tonight. 
I'm extremely nervous 
 about tomorrow. 
I'm nervous about if and what 
I'm going to say tomorrow 
and what impact and effect 
 that's going to have 
on the jury. 
RICHARD: 
 I'm hoping that there 
 is little likelihood 
of my being voted off, 
 but I'm not 
all that confident. 
I'm not really sure. 
I think it's in Kelly's 
 best interest 
to keep me here, 
but I don't know 
 that she'll do that. 
I'm hoping she will. 
RUDY: 
 Well, I think me and Kelly 
would fare better... 
I know some people 
 that would vote for me. 
I don't know of hardly any 
that are going to vote for Rich.
He stepped on some toes, 
and people ain't going 
 to forgive him. 
JEFF: 
Hey, Rich. 
Kelly. 
Hey, Rudy. 
Dang, that's hot. 
Grab a seat.
We'll bring in our jury. 
Well, Kelly, you have 
 a tough decision 
to make tonight.
Rich and Rudy's votes 
effectively cancel 
 each other out. 
Rich can't vote for himself. 
He can't vote for you 
because you 
 have immunity.
He has to 
 vote for Rudy.
Same with Rudy. 
 Can't vote for you.
Can't vote for himself.
 Has to vote for Rich. 
So you guys won't 
 vote tonight. 
Kelly, you're going
 to be the only one 
 casting a vote. 
Great. 
The good news is
 you're going to 
 cast the vote. 
So let's just look at a few 
 of the factors 
that come into play. 
Certainly, from day one, 
the alliance has been a factor. 
Four Pagong members over there 
voted off one by one 
 because of it. 
It's probably a wash, though. 
It's a Tagi alliance. 
You guys are all Tagi. 
So it really comes down 
 to relationships, 
the friendships you have, 
 the impressions 
that have been made 
 on other people. 
The bottom line is this: 
Tonight, you are 
 the queen of the island. 
You have earned it. 
Five challenges in a row. 
That gives you power. 
You can't guarantee 
that you're going to win 
 the million dollars, 
you need them for that, 
but you can guarantee 
 one thing-- 
that one of these two guys 
will not get a million dollars. 
You're going to go up there 
and you're going to write 
 four letters down. 
It's going to be "Rich" 
 or it's going to be "Rudy." 
In effect, you're saying, 
"You're not getting the money." 
You ready to do this? 
Let's cast your vote. 
You know the drill.
One of you will be
leaving Tribal
 Council area. 
There's one vote. 
The 14th person 
 voted off the island... 
is Rudy. 
You need to bring 
 me your torch. 
I don't blame her. 
In this case, 
 Kelly has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go.
That way? 
Yeah. 
Good night.
So here's how 
it will work tomorrow. 
Each member of the jury 
 will get one question. 
You guys will get to respond, 
and then you'll get 
 a chance at the end 
to sort of state your case. 
Now the tables are turned. 
The power's out
 of your hands. 
It's up to them. 
Hope you can get 
 a good night's sleep, 
and I'll see 
 you guys tomorrow.
Good night.
RUDY: 
 I never thought 
 I'd come this far 
and I got three votes, 
 then I got two votes, 
then I got one vote 
and then they forgot about me, 
and I figured, 
 "I'm right in the middle 
where I want to be now." 
And I didn't get a... 
today's the first time 
 I got a vote since... 
a month ago. 
And it was the fatal vote. 
( chuckles ) 
JEFF: 
 Only two remain. 
Stay tuned to find out 
 who will be the sole survivor. 
KELLY: 
 Woke up and it was very weird. 
Richard said to me, 
 "Okay, you're not dreaming. 
It's the last day 
 and it's really just us two." 
It's nice to, to chill out. 
I mean, tonight's 
 going to be a big deal
and it's going
 to be crazy. 
Yeah. 
I think I'm going 
 to go visit my tree. 
Okay. 
For a little while. 
Have fun. 
I will. 
Say good-bye. 
I know. That's what 
 I'm going to do. 
This is just 
 where I like to be. 
This is where I prefer 
to stretch and chill out 
 and do my thing. 
My last little yoga session 
 here on the beach. 
It's something that I've done 
 pretty much every day 
since I've been here. 
It helps me to relax 
and to quiet my thoughts. 
I've had a lot of moral issues.
I regret being part 
 of the alliance. 
That didn't make me 
 feel so good. 
I regret... trusting Sue, 
being vulnerable to her. 
That really hurt me 
 in a lot of ways. 
RICHARD: 
 It's kind of nice 
 to be one of the last two, 
and it's nice to have Kelly 
 as the other member. 
I think I'm, uh, reflecting 
a little bit on what's happened
 for the 39 days. 
I think I'm also thinking 
 a little bit about questions 
that will be asked 
 by the jury tonight, 
and how to approach 
 some potential questions. 
It's an interesting morning, 
and I intend to stay 
 completely out of the sun 
and try and do nothing. 
KELLY: 
 But it's been 
 really hard, mentally. 
Just... 
people trying to... 
My brain is just... 
I can't think about anything, 
 really, right now. 
Burn, baby, burn. 
The end of the spoons. 
Fire, fire. 
KELLY: 
 There's been some... 
 moral low points 
for me in playing this game. 
I've had some, kind of, 
 not-so-proud moments, 
and, uh, that's things 
that I'm leaving here 
on this island, 
 and with this game, 
and, uh, that don't belong 
 in, uh... my life. 
Burning the flag. 
RICHARD: 
 I think it might have been 
 cathartic for Kelly 
to pack things up, organize, 
and burn some of the stuff 
 we just don't need anymore. 
Boards. 
I'll stay out 
 of the fire. 
You just...
Good-bye, camp. 
Burn. 
RICHARD: 
Burn, camp, burn. 
W-what will you miss the most? 
What will I miss the most? 
Just kind of 
looking at sunsets, 
or watching the stars 
or things like that. 
Those quiet moments, 
just recognizing where I am 
in the middle 
of the South China Sea 
on this... 
uninhabited, rain forest, 
 tropical island, and... 
KELLY: 
I just want to get through today
and get through 
the firing squad tonight. 
I don't think 
any of these people 
are vindictive or anything. 
I think it might just be... 
 really fun. 
KELLY: 
 I'm really grateful I'm here. 
Um... I feel lucky to be 
 in the... the final two. 
I'm nervous 
 about the decision tonight 
because Rich never pretended 
that he wasn't in it to win, 
and he never pretended 
 that he wasn't, um... 
scheming and conniving, 
 and all of that, 
from the beginning. 
He's playing the game and 
he's never acted like he wasn't.
So I-I do respect that. 
Okay, can we uh...
Let's get our stash. 
Turn off the lights,
 and, uh... 
Turn off the lights. 
make sure the oven's
 off and everything. 
RICHARD: 
 If I get second place 
 I will not be sad. 
I will be happy that 
 I've earned a hundred grand, 
and had a great time here, 
and played a game that I'm 
 proud of, the way I played it, 
but I want the million. 
I really want the million. 
Oh, my God, 
 it would change my life. 
SEAN: 
 The question: "Does the end 
 justify the means?" 
Apparently, 
 these two contestants 
did whatever it took 
 to get to the end, 
but, you know, it's not 
 the end of the contest yet, 
in my opinion, because 
 they haven't suffered 
all the ramifications 
 of getting there yet. 
GERVASE: 
 Kelly's an all-around 
 nice person. 
I think she just 
 did what she had to do 
to get to the spot 
 of the final two. 
She stayed low 
 under the radar. 
You never really heard 
too much about Kelly, 
 but when it came down to it, 
ended up winning 
 five challenges at the end. 
I'm really quite impressed 
with the way 
 she played the game. 
RUDY: 
 I liked Rich all the way 
 through this thing. 
He's a good leader. 
He's smart, 
 and he's the guy 
that got this alliance going, 
which brought 
 the four of us right 
to the final stage, and that's 
 what we were really after. 
It was interesting 
 to watch Kelly, 
'cause I felt like Kelly 
 went through, like, uh, 
identity crisises on TV, 
 but not really crisises, 
but like various 
 identities on TV. 
"I'm a hippie, 
 but I'm not a hippie." 
"I'm a double agent, 
 but I'm not lying." 
"I'm here for the money, 
 but I'm not." 
You know, it was 
interesting to watch her, uh... 
watch the various identities 
 unfold. 
COLLEEN: 
 This is a really difficult 
 vote because, I mean, 
does anybody really think, 
 you know, 
"Go, Kelly. 
 She's number one." 
"I am so happy she made it 
 to the final two," 
or, "God, I'm glad Rich 
made it there. Big winner"? No. 
But I think we just want 
 to end it, you know? 
Let's go home. 
I'm actually very happy 
 I got out when I did, 
thank God, because 
 I couldn't have been ruthless. 
People would 
 see right through me. 
I can't even lie. 
I can live with myself, 
 and that's the important thing.
Tonight, actually, 
 I'm looking forward 
to being able to come in, 
 because I'm a hunter. 
I got both guns loaded 
 all the way 
and I'm going to fire 'em 
full-blast, 
 and I will walk away on top, 
holding my values, 
 true to myself. 
Oh, yeah. I can't wait 
 to get up there tonight. 
( gong ringing ) 
We'll bring in our final 
 Tribal Council jury. 
Tonight, these seven 
 former tribe mates 
will decide your fate. 
Here's what's at stake: 
One of you will be awarded 
 $100,000 
for your 39 days here. 
The other... 
will be awarded with... 
 a new Pontiac Aztec 
and $1 million 
 to do with whatever you want. 
39 days ago, all you guys 
 came here with probably only 
the vaguest idea 
 of what you were getting into, 
and I just want 
 to congratulate all of you. 
You all made it 
to the final core of nine. 
You endured harsh island living,
lack of food, 
 very unpredictable weather, 
sometimes very, very hot, 
 and sometimes very, very wet. 
You created a new civilization 
 and you lived within it, 
and you all played the game 
 very well-- 
a game that definitely parallels
 our own regular lives in ways 
that we probably never imagined.
Extremely complicated. 
If we were voting tonight 
 for the... sweetest person, 
you can make a strong case 
for Sonja maybe, or Gretchen. 
If it was the most athletic, 
 maybe Gervase, Joel. 
Certainly if it was the best 
outdoors person, probably Greg. 
So we could go around here 
 and find positive attributes 
for why everybody is worthy, 
 but the fact remains 
Rich and Kelly 
are the two sitting here. 
Clearly, these two 
 played the game the best 
and that's what we came here 
to do, play this game, Survivor.
So let's begin 
the final Tribal Council. 
We'll start with opening remarks
 from Rich and Kelly-- 
a chance for you 
 to state your case 
as to why you're 
 still sitting here tonight, 
and why you deserve 
to be the final survivor. 
We'll start with you, Kelly. 
Um... I'm not a politician. 
I didn't come here 
to campaign for myself. 
I think we're all adults here. 
I think we all know that, 
you know, this is a game, 
and, uh, I hope nobody has taken
 anything personally. 
I haven't, uh... or I don't know
that I necessarily haven't 
taken anything personally. 
I've tried not to, 
or I hope we're not 
 going to be judged here 
on how we chose 
 to play the game. 
I'm hoping what 
 we're going to be judged on, 
or I, personally, will be judged
on is the person that I am 
and the conversations that we 
had, the time we spent together,
the things we talked about, 
you know, with, 
with, that game 
we played the other night-- 
how well did you 
get to know people-- 
um, things like that... 
I didn't have 
the conversations I had with you
an-and want to know 
 the things about you 
and share my life with you, 
because I thought I was going 
 to be quizzed on it 
or because it was part 
 of some strategy. 
Um, it was because 
we were all here together 
and I cared to know all of you. 
I don't know. Maybe, as Jeff 
 said, if we were voting 
for the sweetest or the nicest 
or things like that, 
um, maybe neither 
of us would be up here. 
I don't know 
that the best person 
is sitting up here, 
but, uh, hopefully, you know, 
 the better person will win. 
Richard. 
I take a little bit 
 of a different approach to it. 
For me, it's 
 not about you 
deciding who the
 best person is. 
I-I don't think 
 you really know who I am 
and probably don't know 
 who Kelly is. 
My approach to the game 
was one of strategy 
 from the beginning. 
Before I even got here, 
 I started to think 
about what it might take 
to get through 14 ejections, 
 and it got really complicated. 
And I couldn't really plan it 
 as well as I thought 
and it certainly didn't turn out
to, uh, uh, 
 go according to plan, 
but I certainly had a strategy, 
and I came to play a game,
 and I was playing a game. 
There were a lot 
 of sincere interactions,
but no matter 
 how sincere they were, 
I don't think 
 anybody really knows 
who we are in only 39 days. 
I think the starts 
 of friendships 
are certainly 
things that have happened, 
but, uh... for me, 
instead of who's 
 the better person 
it is about 
 who played the game better, 
and I'm hoping you just respect 
my having approached the game 
 from that perspective 
from early, early, early on. 
All right, jury, 
 now it's your turn. 
Take a moment, 
 collect your thoughts, 
then you'll each have 
 an opportunity 
to address both Rich and Kelly. 
All right, jury, 
it's your turn now 
to address Rich and Kelly. 
Each of you will be given 
an opportunity to ask a question
or make a comment. 
Gervase, we'll start with you. 
( clears throat ) 
Kelly and Rich,
how's it going? 
I just wanted to know is there 
any one, two 
 or three things 
 you would change
from your 39 days 
 on this island, or
 nothing at all? 
JEFF: 
 Rich? 
Hmm, good question. Um... 
Well, I got 
too comfortable 
believing that I could 
trust what was said, 
and was really 
surprised to learn 
that I couldn't, 
at one point, 
and that was something 
 that shocked me. 
I thought, "Ooh, damn. I need 
 to stay on my toes even more," 
because I'd been surprised. 
Kelly? 
The one thing 
 I probably would change 
is I probably wouldn't have, um,
joined an alliance, uh... 
when I did, um, 
just because 
of the emotional 
and moral issues that I had, 
and, uh, certainly 
some votes 
that I cast 
strategically 
for myself-- 
alliance, no alliance-- 
 it was about, you know, 
playing the game 
and that was hard, 
voting off competition, 
voting off people I liked, 
people I enjoyed. 
Um, that's about it. 
Great. Thanks, Gervase. 
Jenna. 
Kelly, Rich, 
you guys have a remarkable 
 opportunity tonight-- 
a 50-50 chance at getting 
 a million dollars. 
Yeah, that's
 a big deal, 
and so I 
 want to know
if you could take 
 and put two people 
in your place 
 in lieu of yourselves, 
who would it be and why? 
Wild question:
 "Who would it 
 be and why?" 
Okay, Rudy would be here, 
because it's a game 
and because he and I made 
an alliance very early, 
and, uh, I really appreciated 
his integrity and loyalty, 
even in the midst of this game, 
so I would put him here 
because I thought 
he played 
very, very well. 
Wow, another person 
 I would put here. 
I might have to say Greg. 
He and I didn't get 
a chance to really 
get to know each other. 
I think he's 
pretty guarded, 
but, uh, we did take a walk 
 and I was trying to figure out 
who he was, 
and I thought 
he was certainly, uh, 
my biggest competition, 
so I thought 
 he was probably trying 
to plan something, 
but, uh, 
I never did get 
to find out 
 whether he was or not, so... 
Um, if I could pick two people 
I would probably pick Sonja 
 and Gretchen. 
Uh, I really admire 
those women. 
Um, I felt 
 that they were very strong, 
very smart 
and very honest. 
Maybe we have kind of 
a different approach 
to things, but, uh... 
I really admired their character
and I would like 
 to see them up here. 
Thanks, Jenna. 
Sean. 
Hey, guys, 
 congratulations
 on being here. 
I don't have 
 any questions.
I spent 36 days with you 
 on that beach 
and, damn it, there's a lot 
 of things I want to forget 
rather than ask you
 questions about. 
I just have a 
 few things to say--
nothing disparaging-- 
 about both of you. 
Kelly, thank you very 
 much for being as 
 capable as you are. 
You and Sue 
 single-handedly
kept that camp afloat. 
And, um...
Richard, dear Richard... 
also, likewise, enjoyed 
 your company thoroughly.
You played the game 
 differently than I did,
and it was contentious
 between us at times, 
and, uh, you're there 
and I'm over here, so go figure 
what I know, but, uh, 
 either way, 
congratulations on being there. 
Thank you for 
 teaching me 
 a little bit 
about myself, uh, 
 while I've been here. 
I think you've 
 been very honest
and constructive 
in any criticism 
you have given me. 
Your "F.N.F" idea-- 
the "fat, naked fag" idea 
 is extraordinarily funny 
and a fat, naked fag 
 with a million dollars 
is even funnier, 
 so I haven't made 
 up my mind yet 
but when I get back
 there, I'm going to
 think about it, 
and, uh, we'll see
 which way it goes.
All right, guys,
 congratulations.
Colleen. 
God, he was nice. 
All right, here we go.
No, I'm kidding.
Um, actually, I have
 just a question 
for myself and for
 future players 
 of this game: 
What three character traits do 
you think got you where you are 
and you think are essential 
 and really important 
to be where you are
 at this point? 
JEFF: 
 Kelly, start
 with you. 
I would have to say, uh... 
faith was one, 
 uh, because a week 
or however long ago, 
I was pretty certain 
that I was out of the game. 
I had said before, 
 the only thing 
that kept me in this game 
 up to this point, 
I honestly believe, 
 is that stupid necklace. 
Um, but, uh, I knew 
I wanted to get this far 
and I think faith 
really helped me. 
Probably a strong will. 
There was a lot of... 
of ugliness mentally 
and trying to figure out 
 who you are and, uh, you know, 
what you like about yourself 
and the people 
around you, 
and, uh, I don't know, 
and maybe just a tinge 
of likability, I hope. 
Um, three things 
I can think of 
are, uh, self-awareness, 
 uh, observation... 
Observation? 
And-and... 
Your game the 
 other day was funny.
You say 
 "observation." 
 Uh-huh. 
Like, of observing 
 other people. 
Yeah. 
But then you didn't do so good 
in the game the other day. 
True, it's a different
 kind of observation. 
It's-it's...
When I say self-awareness, 
first of all, 
 I think it requires 
that I understand myself enough 
 to be comfortable 
with playing the game 
the way I felt I had 
to play it to do well. 
Then when it comes 
 to observation, 
it's about observing 
 relationships more than it is 
about learning who people are 
 to become friends with them. 
Nothing against 
becoming friends with 
people-- I'd love to. 
There are many people here 
I'd love to interact with, 
but I wasn't doing that. 
That wasn't my focus, 
and that showed, obviously. 
I was observing what 
people were doing, 
who could be trusted; 
who was planning or plotting, 
 who wasn't; 
who was playing the game well, 
who was trying to play the game;
who was having fun. 
I wasn't judging 
what they were doing. 
I was just trying 
to observe as carefully
 as I could to determine
what people were here for 
 and what they were doing. 
And then I said ethics, 
 because I think 
I played as ethically 
 as is humanly possible. 
I think I-I 
played cleanly 
and, uh, I think 
it's a really 
important piece, 
because if you undermine 
 your credibility along the way 
you stand less of a chance here 
when you face the people 
 that you'd worked with 
to get where you are. 
Rudy. 
I don't have nothing to say 
 to these two. 
I'd just like 
to let everybody here know 
how dumb I feel 
after the mistake 
I made yesterday. 
Okay. 
Greg. 
Yeah. 
Rich. 
Greg. 
Choose a number 
 between one and ten. 
Seven. 
Okay. Kelly, a number 
between one 
 and ten. 
 Three. 
Character is character. 
Sue.
Um, I have no questions. 
I just have statements. 
Rich, you are 
a very openly arrogant,
 pompous human being, 
but I admire your 
 frankness with it.
You have worked hard 
 to get where you're at
and you started 
working hard 
way before you come 
to the island. 
So with my work ethic background
I give that 
 credit to you,
but on the other hand,
 your inability 
to admit your failures 
without going into 
a whiny speech 
makes you a bit 
 of a loser in life.
Kelly... 
the rafting 
 persona queen...
you did get stomped on 
 on national TV 
by a city boy that never swam, 
let alone been 
in the woods or a jungle 
or rowed a boat 
in his life. 
You sucked on that game. 
Anyways, I was your friend
 at the beginning of this, 
really thinking that 
 you were a true friend.
I was willing to be
 sitting there and 
 put you next to me.
At that time, 
you were sweeter than me. 
I'm not 
a very openly nice person. 
I'm just frank, 
 forward and tell 
 you it the way it is. 
To have you sit there 
next to me, and me lose $900,000
just to stomp on 
 somebody like this... 
but as the game went along 
and the two tribes merged 
you lied to me, 
which showed me 
what the true person 
that you are. 
You're very two-faced 
and manipulative to get where 
 you were at anywhere in life. 
That's why you fail
 all the time. 
Hmm... interesting. 
So, at that 
 point of the game 
I decided then just to go out 
 with my alliance to my family 
and just to hold my dignity 
 and values in check, 
and hoping 
 I hadn't lost 
 too many of them, 
and, uh, play the game 
 just as long as possible 
and hang in there 
 as long as possible,
but, Kelly,
go back to a 
 couple of times 
 Jeff said to you
"What goes around 
 comes around." 
It's here.
You will not get my vote. 
My vote will go to Richard, 
and I hope that
 is the one vote
that makes you 
 lose the money.
If it's not, 
so be it. 
I'll shake your hand 
and I'll go on from here, 
but if I were ever pass you 
 along in life again 
and you were laying there 
 dying of thirst, 
I would not give you
 a drink of water. 
I would let 
the vultures take you 
and do whatever they want 
 with you, with no ill regrets. 
I plead to the jury tonight 
to think a little bit about 
the island that we have been on.
This island is pretty much
 full of only two things: 
snakes and rats. 
And in the end 
 of Mother Nature
we have Richard the 
 snake, who knowingly
 went after prey, 
and Kelly, who 
 turned into the rat
that ran around 
 like the rats do
 on this island, 
trying to run 
 from the snake.
I feel we owe it 
 to the island's spirits 
that we have learned 
 to come to know, 
to let it be, in the end, 
the way Mother Nature 
 intended it to be-- 
for the snake 
 to eat the rat.
JEFF: 
 Okay, Rich and Kelly, 
we'll now offer you 
 an opportunity 
for closing remarks 
 if you have something 
different to offer
from your 
 opening remarks,
based on what you've heard 
 from the jury. 
Kelly, I'll start with you. 
Um... Sue, I'm sorry 
 you feel that way. 
Uh, to the rest of you, 
um, I can sit up here 
and, uh, 
probably turn the tables 
on Sue and, uh, tell you 
many number of lies 
and backstabbing things 
that she has done to myself 
and, uh, this person 
sitting next to me. 
I don't think anybody 
 in this game 
is without, um, faults or errors
or, um, unproud moments 
 of themselves. 
Uh, so I already... 
I know how she stands on things.
So to the rest of you, 
um, I hope you vote 
how you feel, 
um, not because of what 
 Sue says 
or the things that happened 
 between she and I, 
because that was between 
 she and I. 
That doesn't involve 
anybody else. 
So, um... 
It's in your hands. 
Rich? 
Um, I imagine it's probably 
a pretty difficult decision 
 for some people, 
and I just want to say 
that I appreciate, uh, 
 your making it. 
I, uh, wouldn't change 
anything that I did, 
and I hope you respect that 
that was what I felt 
I needed to do to play the game.
Thanks. 
JEFF: 
 Okay. 
A little reminder 
 of what's at stake: 
One of these people 
will be awarded
 $100,000. 
The other person--
something very
 different. 
A new Pontiac Aztec... 
and a treasure chest 
 full of $1 million. 
Normally at Tribal Council, 
 we vote against someone. 
We vote somebody 
off the island. 
We've done it 14 times. 
Tonight you will vote 
 for someone. 
You will vote for who you think 
 is most worthy; the winner; 
the person who played this game 
 the best. 
However you want to define it, 
you are casting a vote 
 for who's going to leave here 
with the money 
and the title of survivor. 
Gervase, we'll start with you. 
My vote is for Kelly, 
 because I feel 
Kelly played this game 
better than anybody else. 
She came into this thing, 
she formed her alliance, 
played both sides of the fence, 
did her lying thing, 
 but you know what? 
When it comes down to it, 
 it's all good. 
That's what this game is about 
and she did it 
better than anybody else. 
She stayed low under the radar 
 and just did her thing, 
and I think 
 she really deserves this 
more than anybody else here. 
And just one of Sue's comments 
that's what, in my town, 
 we call a "sore loser," 
because when Sue was doing 
 the backstabbing, the lying, 
the throwing the knives 
everywhere, she was happy. 
If she was sitting 
in Kelly's spot right now, 
she wouldn't be thinking about 
nothing but this million dollars
and that's it. 
So that just goes to show you 
 how trite she is. 
I mean, it disgusts me 
 what she just did. 
It was so foul. 
You know, 
Sue put knives in my back. 
Sue, she talks 
 about a rat and a snake? 
Well, Sue, uh, 
 formed an alliance, 
so that's her little snake part,
 and then she did the rat part 
where she lied to Colleen 
 in her face 
when Colleen asked her 
 if she voted for her. 
So, I mean, 
that just goes to show you 
how people play this game 
when it comes down to it. 
If it's saving their butt 
they'll do anything 
 to save their butt. 
When they're out of the game, 
 they cry about it. 
They bellyache about it 
 the whole stinking time 
and that makes me sick. 
So, Kelly, I hope you win it, 
and after you win it, 
you can stuff it in Sue's face. 
I am choosing Kelly. 
I think Kelly displayed 
 a lot of the aspects 
that I think are a survivor. 
She befriended me, 
and whether that was part 
 of a friendship or strategy, 
it was all a part of the game. 
Uh, she played it well. 
She proves that 
 by sitting up there. 
She endured not only 
the physical but the emotional, 
especially after 
 the last speech. 
I felt for her. 
I think she is a good person. 
I think if she lied 
 and she manipulated 
it-it was in 
 the spirit of the game. 
But as far as Kelly, 
I still get the vibe 
that she's a great person. 
And she certainly did survive 
along with the rest of us, 
and she made it, uh, very clear 
 in the last five challenges 
that she could do this. 
Uh, and she endured the rain 
 and the hunger, 
as well, if not better, 
 than the rest of us. 
So, uh, I think 
 she is a survivor, 
and I think she deserves the 
 title and the million dollars. 
Okay, guys, it's been 
 a long time coming. 
It's been a long contest. 
The general sentiment 
 in the jury box is that 
this contest has degenerated 
 from a contest 
of who's the most deserving 
 into a contest 
of who's least objectionable. 
I feel that way very strongly. 
You both conducted yourselves 
 in different manners than me-- 
the way I would have wanted to--
um, and you put the whole jury 
 in a real difficult position. 
Um, I don't think 
either of you truly deserve it, 
but I am voting for Rich 
because Kelly was clearly 
 more deceptive, 
more manipulative, um, 
 more double-faced than Richard 
who's just 
an out-and-out scoundrel. 
But I like him, uh, 
 in some bizarre manner, 
and I think that his 
fat, naked fag idea is fantastic
and a fat, naked fag 
with a million dollars 
 is just hilarious. 
( sputtering lips ) 
( chuckles ) 
This is awful, really. 
This whole... you know what? 
I mean, take it, 
 and do what you want with it. 
I don't care. 
What got me tonight-- 
 I'm changing my vote. 
I came here voting 
 for the other person-- 
What got me tonight was that 
 you said "will" is required 
in this game, 
 and that's something you had. 
And, uh, even though you were 
 kind of wishy-washy and stuff, 
you know, you wanted it 
 really, really bad 
and Rich doesn't need it. 
So, buy a raft and start 
an adventure tour company 
and do something good with it 
and maybe this will make you 
 be nice or something. 
Okay, that's all. 
As I stated, Rich, I admire 
 your strong work ethic. 
You started a long time ago 
 to get here 
and you're honest 
 about why you're here. 
So, you can have it. 
We had an alliance to the end, 
and I'm fulfilling 
 my obligation. 
Okay, breathe. 
( exhales deeply ) 
JEFF: 
 Well, this has been 
an amazing experience. 
I can't wait to see 
 how it turns out. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
16 of you were... 
brave enough to be marooned here
 in Borneo. 
There will be one survivor. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote... 
"Rich."
"Kelly." 
"Rich."
"Kelly." 
"Rich." 
"Kelly."
That's three votes Rich, 
 three votes Kelly. 
I need water
 and oxygen. 
The winner of the first 
 Survivor competition is... 
"Rich."
Congratulations,
 Rich. 
( applause ) 
Congratulations.
Nicely played.
Kelly, 
 congratulations. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned to hear the final 
 words from the sole survivor. 
RICHARD: 
 Wow, I've won. 
It's an amazing place to be, 
 a heck of an opportunity. 
I'm not exactly certain 
 what I'm going to be doing 
with the million dollars. 
I hope to make the lives 
 of my family and friends 
and those I care about happier.
I hope to remain who I am. 
I'm pretty certain 
 I'll be able to do that. 
It's-it's a wonderful feeling, 
and I'm really looking forward 
 to getting home. 
When I get home, 
 then I can really think 
about what I'm going 
 to use the money for 
and plan and act on that. 
I've won a car. 
That's just super-- 
uh, just a... just a nice, nice
 thing to have had happened. 
The million dollars 
 is a heck of an opportunity 
that I hope I, uh, don't waste.
