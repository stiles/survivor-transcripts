         BRYANT GUMBEL: 
 Richard Hatch, 
 congratulations.
Thank you, Bryant. 
( applause and cheering ) 
You, uh...
You clean up nice.
You look a 
 lot different 
than the guy we 
 saw on the island.
Okay. 
Are you a 
 lot different 
 than the guy 
we got to know
 on the island?
Um, I'm not sure who you think 
 I was on the island, 








to tell you the truth, but, uh, 
 I don't think 
I'm much different 
 than that person. 
We saw one poll,
 that, um, said, 
"Of the final four,
who would you least
 like to see win?" 
And your total
 was equal 
to that of the
 other three. 
( laughter ) 
Uh, does that make this
 a bittersweet victory? 
Uh, not for me. 
I-I think, uh, 
 the press made more... 
made more out of my kind 
of being, uh, evil than people. 
The mail I'm getting 
 is really supportive. 
People are, uh, uh, positive 
 and-and say, 








"Go get 'em," 
 and "We wanted you," and... 
It's good 
 to hear. 
So I think 
 it might be just the press. 
That's good 
 to hear. Kelly,
close but 
 no cigar. 
How often do you
 think about what
 could have been?
Uh, every day. 
( laughter ) 
Kelly! 
So much for it 
 only hurts for a 
 little while, right?
Yeah, well, you know. 
Um, it was hard
 not to notice 
at the end 
 of the program
that you didn't
 have a hug 
or a handshake for Sue. 
Yeah. 
Still hurt? 
Would you? 
I'm over it. 
 You're over it?
Yeah. Life goes on. 
It was a mean game, so... 
a lot of mean things, but, uh...
And you found out 
 how mean it was? 
I'm over it. 
SUE: 
Oh, yeah. 
I told her 
she should, uh... 
( applause and cheering ) 
What she should have done 
was hauled off and hit me... 
( laughter ) 
when the game was over with, 
 you know. 
She may hit you before
 the hour's over with. 
You never know.
They couldn't have 
done anything. 
You never know. 
Good evening and welcome. 
I'm Bryant Gumbel, 
 and these are the 16 castaways 
that we've gotten 
to know over the last 13 weeks. 
Tonight marks 
 the very first time 
they've gathered together 
 off that island 
in the South China Sea. 
So consider the next hour 
 a new Tribal Council, 
one loaded with fun 
and consisting 
 of a much larger tribe. 
For in addition 
 to the castaways, 
we have assembled an audience 
 of family, friends and fans. 
And tonight, we'll hear 
 from them 
and from you, through exclusive 
 scientific polling 
being conducted right now 
 while we're on the air. 
Tonight, there are no alliances,
 no immunity, no rules, 
no deep thoughts about 
 Survivor's cosmic relevance, 
what it all meant. 
Only the stories the castaways 
haven't been able to tell, 
questions they haven't 
 been able to answer, 
and issues they haven't been 
 able to resolve until tonight. 
We think you'll want to hear 
 what they have to say 
to each other and to you, 
 and you will right after this. 
( applause and cheering ) 
As we begin tonight, 
I think we can assume now 
that everyone is familiar 
with Susan Hawk, Rudy Boesch, 
 Kelly Wiglesworth, 
and Richard Hatch, all of whom 
made it to the final four. 
But since our other castaways 
spent less time 
 before the camera, 
some introductions 
 might be in order. 
You might recall 
 that Sonja Christopher 
and her ukulele were the first 
to leave the island, followed...
( applause and cheering ) 
Followed in order by 
 B.B. Andersen, 
( applause and cheering ) 
attorney Stacey Stillman, 
( applause and cheering ) 
biochemist Ramona Gray, 
( applause and cheering ) 
our bible-toting 
 proud virgin Dirk Been, 
( applause and cheering ) 
the free-spirited Joel Klug, 
( applause and cheering ) 
and Gretchen Cordy. 
( applause ) 
And then 
there are those castaways 
who may be more familiar 
 to many of us. 
They stayed on the island longer
and played a critical role 
 as the jury-- 
Greg Buis, 
 the coconut phone man, 
( applause and cheering ) 
Jenna Lewis, 
( applause and cheering ) 
Gervase "Never Nervous" 
 Peterson, 
( applause and cheering ) 
America's sweetheart, 
 Colleen Haskell... 
( loud applause and cheering ) 
and the island's 
 resident doctor, 
the alphabetically-inclined 
 Sean Kenniff. 
( applause and cheering ) 
Thanks, Bryant.
That's all right. 
 Thank you 
 very much. 
You said 
it was the least objectionable. 
Absolutely. 
 Is that really
what it came down to? 
 I felt that 
 he deserved it. 
You know, he was a great... 
He organized 
 and engineered the alliance. 
He's Darth Gaydar. 
That's what 
 we've been calling him. 
The leader of the alliance. 
( laughter ) 
 And I think 
he did a fantastic job. 
He's the puppeteer 
 of the whole alliance 
that you see sitting on 
 the couch before you, and...
BRYANT: 
 Colleen, you ad...
Colleen admitted that 
 she changed her vote. 
Right. 
Did any of the other, 
 any of the rest of you--
were you swayed by anything 
you heard that night? 
The numbers. 
 ( laughter ) 
Pure and simple.
Was that the
 number deal?
Yeah, I... 
Did he get it right?
Was the number seven? 
No, it was number nine. 
 It was nine.
He was close, though. 
Everybody picked seven. 
So if Kelly would 
 have said nine... 
It would have been Kelly. 
...she'd be 900
 grand richer? 
( audience groaning ) 
 Ooh!
...That many... 
I know. 
 Who knew? 
Who knew? 
Well, you know. 
Susan...
Mm. 
( laughter ) 
 Uh... 
You proud of
 that speech?
Yeah. I was pissed 
 at the time, 
( laughter ) 
and, yeah, I'm... 
I never regret what I say. 
But, uh, 
yeah, it's over with. 
What happened...? 
At the time, 
it worked for me, Bryant. 
No, that's okay.
 Hey, it's cool. 
It worked, it worked. 
I'm just wondering 
 what happened, because
when you got voted off, 
 you were all smiles, 
and you were like,
 "You know what? 
"That's good. 
 I wanted 
"to be in the final four, 
 and I did. 
And got it right there." 
And then you
 came back, 
an hour and 
 a half later, 
and it's like, zing, pow, bang.
Well, yeah, when it ended up, 
 being, uh, Kelly and Rich... 
A long time early on 
in the game, 
me and Kelly were... 
I told Kelly, 
 "Let's stomp him. 
Let's just..." 
I wanted to beat him, 
just beat Rich. 
I didn't want 
the million dollars, because 
you get a million bucks, 
and you got a lot 
of leeches that come out 
 from under the leaves. 
( laughter ) 
If I'm going 
to make a million bucks, 
I'd rather work for it. 
Yeah. 
And I'm not 
real Miss Nice 
 like Kelly's nice. 
You know, I 
talk to people, 
 I'm polite to people, 
but I don't go out 
 of my way to... 
Yeah. 
 You know? 
Kiss their backside. 
So, um, I thought, 
"Oh, the two of us, 
and then we get down to the end,
 and we can burn Rich." 
It would have probably worked...
Yeah, but then we got... 
 had the tiff, you know, 
and then Kelly was, like, doing 
 that lopsided thing, and... 
But didn't you think
 the speech...? 
And then it was, like, 
 "Okay, Kelly, 
"you're not in the alliance, 
 you're in the alliance. 
"Okay, you tell them 
you're not in the alliance, 
but you... you are." 
Yeah. 
"Don't lie to me 
and tell me that you told them."
 You know? 
But didn't you 
 think the speech
was a little harsh? 
It might have been, 
but, hey, that's the way I am. 
Yeah. 
 I can take it. 
If you want to give me one, 
 have at me because... 
No, I'm not going to 
 pick a fight with you.
( laughter ) 
Um... 
I don't 
 recommended
 it, Bryant.
No way. 
No, stay away. 
Kel, in... 
in retrospect, do you... 
 do you think 
about, "Hey, I should 
 have gone at it with Rudy 
instead of Rich?" 
No. What I had 
 originally thought 
when the vote... 
When we voted for these two, 
 I thought, "Okay, 
"you know, I'm going to stick 
 with my vote again. 
"I'll stick with Rich, 
"and it will be a tie, 
"and then, they can fight it out
"and have a tie.
And then, 
 whoever is 
 there is there."
And that was my initial thought,
was to do that. 
And I probably should 
 have stuck with that, 
 because I knew... 
I knew Sue was going 
 to be bitter. 
I-I knew she was, 
 and I told Rich 
all that last day... 
You haven't second
 guessed yourself? 
I mean, you had the chance
 to-to go head-to-head 
with Rich or Rudy. 
And I was going 
 to keep my vote for Rich 
and, you know, 
 the vote for Sue. 
And then, they could decide 
 the tie-breaker 
between the two of them, 
 and then... 
Yeah. 
...you know, nobody would have 
 voted them off, because 
that is what would have 
happened. 
Right.
And, uh, but she told me 
 she wasn't going 
to let me get down to the three,
 and so, I-I... 
I couldn't let her... 
RICHARD: 
 She did. On 
 the final day,
she talked, um,
quite a bit about, uh,
anticipating and trying
to think about 
 what it was going to be like 
when asked questions 
 or talked to by people, 
and-and she knew 
 something was coming, honey. 
I knew it, I knew it. 
Oh, yeah, we all knew 
 something was coming. 
This place reacted 
like a Super Bowl 
during that speech, 
 I'm telling you. 
 ( laughter ) 
Rudy, what were
 you thinking 
when you let
 the pole go?
( laughter and applause ) 
I, uh... 
I must have fell asleep 
or something. 
( laughter ) 
I mean, you 
 know, poor Marge. 
Yeah... 
I mean, she's 
 sitting up there. 
Hi, Mrs. Boesch. 
Um, when you got
 home, did she 
turn to you and go, "Rudy!" 
Not her. The kids. 
( laughter and applause ) 
My kids are probably all... 
All three girls 
 turned and said...
Yeah. I think 
 they're all sitting 
at, uh, Gillian's tonight, 
 and, uh... 
( Bryant laughing ) 
I don't know what. 
Probably under the table. 
( laughter ) 
 You know, 
that last... 
that last Tribal Council, 
you sat there saying, 
"I need oxygen."
Mm. 
 Right? 
 "I need air." 
Somebody 
 talk to me.
I mean, was 
 that at once
the best and worst part 
 of being on the island, 
the Tribal Councils? 
Worst all the time. 
The-The 
 last council... 
 Yeah? 
when we were 
 sitting and waiting
for votes and stuff?
But throughout. 
When anybody got... 
SEAN: 
 I think Richard's 
 perspective 
is a little skewed.
It was probably the best 
moment of his 
 life, you know? 
For the rest 
 of us... 
COLLEEN: 
 Yeah. 
I think in the jury box, 
 it was kind of a downer. 
No doubt about it. 
He's the only one 
that doesn't know 
what it's like 
to be voted off. 
Yeah. 
 It sucks. 
COLLEEN: 
 Exactly. 
But, for example, 
 I know that, 
for example, Colleen
 and Gervase told me 
before that they expected it 
 when they got it. 
But I also know that Ramona 
and Dirk-- 
you guys said you were shocked, 
that you were stunned. 
Still shocked. 
 Oh, I... 
And Joel. 
DIRK: 
Yeah, it's just... 
Yeah, it's, like, 
when-when it comes 
out of left field, 
 I mean, this is 
like my family, you know, 
 and then it comes 
out of left field, 
 and you get the boot, 
and it's just like, 
 whoa, you know. 
RICH: 
 Then Gretchen. 
 Oh, man, when 
 Gretchen got it.
That's, oh... 
 ( whistling ) 
That was hurt. 
 Jenna was 
 crying. 
RUDY: 
 The reason 
 Joel went--
 he was a 
a male chauvinist pig. 
( laughter and applause ) 
BRYANT: 
 Come on now.
SEAN: 
 He is not.
Come on. You
 got tell... 
JOEL: 
It was the cow. 
He said the cow thing, man. 
This dude said 
 the cow thing. 
I just stood there 
 and said, 
"Hey, whatever, man." 
I am not a chauvinist. 
I did not say anything 
that was chauvinistic. 
Okay, Gerv, 
 how about that?
I'll vouch
 for that. 
Come on, throw it 
 out there, man. 
The truth is this-- 
I said the comment, 
but Joel lives and breathes it. 
( audience groaning ) 
( applause ) 
Isn't that true? 
JOEL: 
I cannot believe 
you're doing that right now. 
JENNA: 
 Okay, it's a 
 little true. 
How many we got? 
 It is.
How many women have you got? 
One, two, three...
ALL: 
 Oh. 
COLLEEN: 
 No. That's 
 not... 
Oh, no, 
oh, no. 
BRYANT: 
 We're not going
to go there
 right now. 
Uh... Sonja and B.B., 
uh, you were the first ones 
 to get bounced. 
Uh, you went a lot farther 
 than any of us, 
but was there 
 any embarrassment 
 attendant to that?
So much anticipation, 
 and then, as soon 
as you get there, 
 you're out of there.
You know, when you're on 
 the island, it doesn't seem... 
I mean, it happened 
 for a reason, 
and it was just my tribe there 
and Jeff, and it was okay. 
But then you come back home, 
and 40 million people 
are watching you get voted off. 
It's sort of humiliating, but...
But it gave you 
 a bigger platform.
Yes. So... 
Right?
B.B., did it feel that awful? 
Well, I, you know, where I... 
 helped engineer my own demise, 
I-I felt pretty stupid later on.
( scattered chuckling ) 
Um... probably one 
 of the worst decisions 
I've ever made, and, uh... 
That's all right. 
...I regretted it, 
but, you know, 
 that's the way the game is. 
You make an impulsive decision, 
and... and you regret it. 
But, uh... 
Let me close out
 this segment 
with a question to you,
uh, Rudy. 
Throughout the weeks, 
we heard some of your comments 
 about homosexuals. 
Didn't like them 
 in a homosexual way.
"Queers," 
et cetera, et cetera. 
And yet in the 
 final analysis,
you wound up voting
 for a gay guy, 
who you believed in,
 and who you trusted.
I'm curious if the 
 experience on the island
changed any of your
 preconceptions 
about the sexual
 orientation of 
 individuals? 
Nah, nah. 
( laughter and applause ) 
You've got to love him. 
( applause continues ) 
B.B.: 
That wasn't the answer 
you wanted, Bryant. 
You want 
to try it again? 
It's not true. 
We set up an alliance, 
and, uh, 
I gave him my word, 
and my word is good. 
Uh, the reason 
I called him queer... 
( cheers and applause ) 
The reason I called him queer 
is so all my good 
 SEAL team buddies 
will know 
 what I'm talking about. 
( laughter ) 
When we come back-- I'll get 
 to it when we come back. 
When we come back, 
 more from the castaways. 
And later, we'll hear 
 what you have to say 
as we get the results 
 of a special poll 
that we're conducting tonight. 
All that 
and a few surprises, too, 
when Survivor: The Reunion 
returns right after this. 
( cheers and applause ) 
Ten days inside my shower 
with this monkey and-and 
 these giant insects. 
And I forced myself to live 
 off of the dirty bath water 
and whatever hair I could 
 collect from the drain. 
( sighs ) 
( cheers and applause ) 
Thank you, Bryant. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
How do you like that? 
I didn't pick them, Sean. 
Was that talent or what? 
See? How can you ignore 
 talent like that? 
And they selected you!
I know. Unbelievable. 
( chuckling ) 
 Unbelievable. 
And they selected you!
It's their own fault. 
Absolutely.
Man, you know what?
Hey, Rudy, 
is this true what I hear, 
that you applied actually 
 to be on Survivor II? 
Yeah. 
You wanted to 
 do it again? 
SEAN: 
 Till he wins. 
( scattered laughter ) 
I'm going to keep trying 
 till I win. 
( cheers and applause ) 
You know-- 
Go ahead, Rich.
You know, Bryant, 
Rudy's comments, I mean,
he comes 
 from a different generation, 
but he is a kind and gentle 
 and honest and amazing man 
who-who I feel
um, uh, really close to. 
We have a great
 relationship. 
Not that close. 
And the comments
 you hear 
are good-hearted. 
Um, the words that you
 hear often sound as if
they're, uh, um, un-P.C., 
 if you will, 
but that's not 
 what's in his heart. 
He also gave, 
 we should note--
he's too shy and too
 modest to admit it--
he's a legitimate hero 
 who gave 45 years 
Absolutely. 
of service to his country.
( cheers and applause ) 
( cheering continues ) 
And Rudy... 
I was-I was 
 reading about...
I was reading about 
 some of your adventures. 
Is this true that you and four 
other guys spent 18 months 
on a decommissioned ship 
 in Hong Kong after the war?
Nine months. 
 Nine months.
Was that harder than this?
Yeah. 
( laughter ) 
Was the company better?
Uh... I was there with a guy 
 named John Kennedy, 
and, uh, when Kennedy 
made president, I checked, 
'cause if it was the same guy, 
I would have been 
 the vice president. 
He was a crook from way back. 
We can assume it wasn't.
You know, speaking 
 of the physical rigors there, 
um, Ramona, talk to me about 
 the smell on the island. 
The reason I ask 
 is because Ramona 
described it as the smell 
of, what, hot garbage?
( laughs ):
 Yes. 
I mean, we were all funky, 
 and... 
( laughter ) 
...after about 
 three or four days, 
you know, we were sweating, 
 we're working, 
we're traipsing 
 through the jungle... 
we just all stank, and so,
yeah, it was hot garbage. 
It was disgusting. 
Not that bad. 
It was bad. 
 Gretchen, how 
 long did it take
to get over the 
 self-consciousness
of the way you smelled? 
A couple of days. 
You know what... 
'Cause we all smelled bad. 
...I don't remember it. 
 I honestly didn't. 
I mean, we were swimming 
all the time, so I don't... 
We all stank. 
I don't recollect 
 any odor either. 
Besides Sean's odor. 
That's the only one. 
 Yeah, my own. 
Greg was pretty smelly. 
I wouldn't say hot garbage. 
BRYANT: 
 So nobody stunk?
There wasn't any
 hot garbage? 
No. 
RUDY: 
 Not in our camp.
Let's take a question 
from the audience. 
We've got a young lady 
up here 
who's anxious 
to ask something. Yes? 
WOMAN: 
This question is for everybody. 
I was just curious as to what 
was the first thing that you ate
once you got off the island, 
and if any of you are ever going
 to eat rice again? 
Love rice.
Ooh, rice. 
 I know, 
 I still eat rice. 
I buy rice... 
Can't get enough 
of rice. 
Actually, the first thing 
I had was... 
I had shrimp. 
 I had a peanut butter 
 and jelly sandwich 
Jenna bought for me.
BRYANT: 
Sean, you have pizza? 
It was all about
 pizza for me. 
Gerv and I hit Pizza Hut
in Kota Kinabalu. 
 Who lost the most weight
on the island?
Rich. 
Rich. 
 Rich. 
Are you kidding? 
 How much? How much?
Uh, maybe 34 pounds, I think. 
And I lost 100 
 before I got there. 
Wow. Wow. 
 ( applause ) 
I needed it. 
BRYANT: 
 That's a nice look, Rich. 
RICH: 
 Thank you.
Oh. 
Who gained all their
 weight back already?
( laughter ) 
Let me talk a little bit 
 about, um... 
what some of you think 
 is a dirty word, "alliance." 
Um... dirty 
 word, Kelly?
Why did you feel
 so bad about it?
'Cause it, I don't know, 
 it made the game 
not fun anymore. 
It was just sort of like, okay, 
stand up in line and leave 
whenever everybody decides 
 for you to, you know. 
But the game was 
a little more fun 
than ours though. 
Yeah. 
 ( scattered chuckling ) 
'Cause we're over here. 
 Well, you know. 
No, for real, though. 
I look back 
at the first show, 
and it's like, 
man, that was fun. 
We're jumping off the boat, 
working as a team, 
 it's all innocent. 
And then you get to, like, 
 the last couple shows, 
you know, and you're just like, 
and it's like, "Ugh," you know? 
It's like, just battle. 
 Too nasty? 
And, yeah, 
 it just, it was just... 
Joel, I heard 
 you said something
 very interesting. 
You said that the gen-xers 
in your tribe 
 weren't really into
Tagi-like alliances. 
What does gender have...? 
I mean, what 
 does generation 
 have to do with it?
It's age group, I think. 
 You think? 
We were younger, 
 we kind of, were hanging out, 
and we went there 
 for a situation 
that was a little bit different,
I think, maybe than theirs. 
Right away when they got there, 
they were very corporate, 
 very structured. 
And if you look 
at our younger generation, 
we're just all kind of 
doing our own thing. 
We don't want to follow 
a certain path. 
And that how we're kind of doing
things and that's what we did. 
There's nothing wrong with that.
 B.B. was happy 
 about that. 
BRYANT: 
 Gretchen, you're sitting
 there disagreeing. Why? 
No, I disagree. 
I think, you know, 
you're either the type of person
who gets 
sucked in emotionally 
or you're the type of person 
who can separate yourself. 
And Rich and I even 
 talked about this, 
and he, going into it, thought, 
I'm not getting 
 emotionally involved. 
And perhaps that's why 
he didn't do well when he was 
asked about everybody's families
and what they were wearing 
and stuff 
because he was able 
 to separate himself. 
I can meet someone 
for five minutes 
and not be able to emotionally 
separate myself from them. 
But it was still 
a game though. 
Yeah, it wasn't, though. 
I think the alliance 
 was appropriate. 
You thought it was fair?
Absolutely. 
I-I suspected that-that if, uh, 
 if the Pagong tribe 
didn't-didn't establish 
 some kind of alliance, 
they'd be dead. 
And I felt that, 
and I think I mentioned it 
 to Gretchen early on. 
But, uh... 
But on 
the other hand, B.B., 
you said you could 
never lie about it. 
Well, 
that's all part of it. 
No, but I think you can belong 
 to an alliance 
and not lie about it. 
If someone asks 
 if you belong to an alliance 
you say, "Sure. So, what?" 
Yeah, they went a 
 step further than 
 we were going to do.
We were going to have 
 our team hold together.
But he just went a step further,
 he was a little smarter. 
You know who I lied to?
I lied to Jeff Probst,
 the host. 
That's who I lied to. 
Well, so did Susan.
Yeah, well, 
had to though. 
Susan, you were 
 a bad liar, too.
A terrible liar. 
Oh, I'm, like awful. 
I even told these guys, 
oh, I lie so bad. 
 You looked 
 right at him
and went, "No. 
No."
It was bad. It was bad. 
So, I was glad 
to have that opportunity. 
SEAN: 
 Listen, I needed
 the alliance 
to stay alive and I knew 
 it was going on, believe me. 
We have another 
 question up here. 
Yes, young lady?
Um, this question 
 is for the whole group. 
How do you feel now that you've 
 seen the show on television? 
Awesome. 
 Love the show.
Great. 
 Great show.
A lot of what you see out 
 there-- I'm sorry, Jenn. 
A lot of what you 
 see out there is 
 very manufactured.
I mean, while my, 
you know, lightheartedness 
and whatever you want 
to say about my intellect, 
is a close approximation 
 of the real thing, 
everyone here, including myself,
is a lot deeper character 
than anything that you saw 
on television. 
Does anyone think 
 they were depicted
in a fashion 
that was either 
unfair or inaccurate? 
GRETCHEN: 
Not myself, 
but I think Greg was. 
Oh, I would agree with that. 
He was a lot 
 more boisterous.
He's very intelligent 
and he's not like a goofball... 
And I got to 
 stick up for Sean.
Sean is actually 
 very intelligent. 
BRYANT: 
 Sean is not goofy?
He is not. He's 
 very intelligent. 
SEAN: 
 Thank you very much.
You know, he said the 
 show is manufactured. 
I don't want people 
 to get the wrong idea,
because I think
 they really did
a good job at depicting 
the sequence and the process 
 pretty accurately. 
I mean, CBS, Mark Burnett, 
 and Craig Piligian, 
those people put together 
 a program... 
You got the 
 million, Rich.
You don't need
 to do this. 
No, amazing. 
You got the million. 
( applause ) 
The camera phone... 
out of this world. 
Coming up... coming up, 
we're going to talk about 
 romance on the island-- 
what did and didn't happen. 
 ( audience whooping ) 
And Jeff Probst joins us 
 from Australia 
with the first look 
 at what lies in store 
for the next Survivor castaways.
That's right after this. 
( cheers and applause ) 
But in my years growing up 
on a Wisconsin dairy farm, 
I've learned many different 
 survival techniques. 
For instance, 
 hunting for firewood. 
( cocks gun ) 
Freeze, firewood, now! 
 On the ground! 
( cheers and applause ) 
That was good! 
That's the first time 
I've seen that since I made it. 
My mom was so disappointed 
 with that film. 
She didn't like it so much 
 it's the only thing 
she wouldn't copy, 
 out of this whole thing. 
After that, 
they put you 
on the island with us? 
Yeah, well, I mean, 
 I'm good with a shotgun. 
BRYANT: 
 Imagine what the people
who are applying for the
 second one are thinking.
They've seen yours, 
 they've seen Sean's. 
I mean, my goodness.
B.B.: 
We're going to have 
some fruitcakes. 
Let's go back 
for another question. 
Yes, ma'am? 
Yes, my question 
 is for Colleen and Greg. 
Was there a budding romance 
 going on between you two 
while you were on the island, 
and is there something
 going on now? 
( all oohing ) 
BRYANT: 
 A two-part question.
I've talked about it enough. 
And, uh, and so, I'm
 going to pass the...
pass the buck. 
Well, um... 
Actually, 
 I want it back.
Nothing happened. 
( laughter ) 
Nothing happened. 
I was covering 
 for another relationship 
going on. 
( crowd gasping ) 
 All I'm 
 going to say. 
That's all I'm
 going to say. 
Okay. Pick a number. 
( laughing ) 
 Pick a number. 
How would you characterize 
the relationship 
on the island with Colleen? 
With Colleen, um... 
 Yeah. 
It was excellent; 
we had a great time 
together, and, uh... 
it wouldn't have been 
 the same at all. 
We both... played 
 really well together 
and, uh, inspired each other 
 to have a great time. 
GUMBEL: 
 Well, who's idea was it 
 to tease the audience 
and-and leave everyone thinking
that maybe 
 something happened?
We were there 
to make 
a TV show, I mean... 
we were there. 
 Is that to say 
 it was your idea? 
Sex and violence. 
Duh! 
( cheering and applause ) 
They want it. 
They got it. 
So it was your idea?
I wouldn't say 
it was either person's idea-- 
 we just had fun. 
It was all a 
 joke, real... 
I mean, w-when people 
 ask you questions, 
you know what they want, 
 so give 'em the answer. 
I-It's more interesting 
 and exciting. 
What about the 
 second part of the
 lady's question? 
What about since the island? 
No. 
Are you going to tell 
the truth this time? 
I live in 
 Miami; he lives
in Colorado. 
So what?
( laughing ) 
They don't have planes 
 in either place is 
 what you're telling us?
I... 
I mean, I'm-I'm
23. 
Did I miss
 something?
She's-she's... 
trying to say 
 "No, there isn't, 
at this point." 
 I mean, you know, 
young, have fun, 
 see lots of people. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
I mean, look, there 
 are a lot of people who
 thought strange things.
They thought
Sean... and Jenna. 
See, now, we 
 did have sex. 
( cheering and applause ) 
No.
 Okay, we made 
 an agreement... 
That's... 
not to talk about that. 
That's sarcasm. 
I do think we should talk 
a little bit about, 
um, Joel and Gervase. 
Yes! 
You know... 
 It had to come out. 
Let's bring it out. 
GUMBEL: 
 Oh, my God, 
 they're out.
Well, now, wait 
 a second, though. 
I did read 
 that Richard...
 Richard said 
that on the day before Colleen 
was complaining about him 
walking around
 buck nekkid, 
 Absolutely.
that Colleen and
 Gervase and Greg
 And Greg. 
had been sitting 
 around the fire nekkid.
GREG: 
Lying around 
on top of each other 
near the fire. 
 True? 
GREG: 
Yeah. 
Sans clothes? 
Sans clothing?
 Clothes... 
Clothing, sans
 clothing? 
Yeah. 
Other languages. 
I mean, it's raining; you're 
 drying off, but I'm not going 
to play that game, like, 
 "You were naked, too." 
You know, I mean, 
 come on. 
 Oh!
Oh! 
 RICHARD: 
 ...More naked than she is. 
GUMBEL: 
 You were naked? 
COLLEEN: 
 I mean, yeah, I was. 
...There you are. 
All right, 
not like that, though, 
not like that. 
What was the deal 
 there, Richard? 
Um, nudity is just something 
 I'm comfortable with. 
I mean, it's, uh... 
 and it's a deserted island, 
110 degrees in the middle 
 of the South... 
South Sea... 
Deserted? 
( all talking over each other ) 
A few people on 
 the camera crew,
and I've got to say, 
 "Hey, Chris." My son. 
I forgot to say hi to my son. 
 Hey, you. 
It didn't bother 
 you that it might've
 offended some folks?
Um, when it did offend 
 some people, 
I immediately put 
 my clothes back on.
It was my birthday; I'd intended
 to spend the entire day nude. 
So it was your
 birthday suit.
 Yeah, absolutely. 
We intended to kick you 
off the island. 
 Absolutely. They tried.
But I... but I... 
but my intention 
 isn't to offend. 
It was just to be comfortable, 
and, actually, the Tagi team 
 had plenty of time 
to get used to that, and got... 
 and didn't... 
Once we combined, 
 it changed a little bit, 
so I had no trouble 
 putting clothing on 
Yeah. 
 most of the time. 
Being from Tagi, 
I-I would think 
that you'd be more 
 in the alliance thing, 
and I think 
 that was everybody's problem-- 
was that you were alone... 
 and naked, 
like, naked and alone... 
where Gervase and I 
were purely trying 
to come to the bottom 
of an age-old myth, 
and Colleen was judging. 
( laughing ) 
( cheering and applause ) 
GREG: 
We worked together. 
There were a couple 
of people naked. 
Let's-let's get 
 another... let's 
 get another question. 
Yes, what's 
 your question?
Um, so, what
 was it like 
eating the bugs: 
the live worms and stuff? 
Whoo! 
Gervase should answer that. 
Gerv. 
 Stacey.
Yeah, Gerv and Stacey. 
 Stacey.
Um... everybody just said, 
"Why not show my poker face?" 
 and that was my poker face. 
That was 
your poker face? 
 Oh, yeah. 
I want to play 
with you. 
 Yeah. 
That was the worst thing 
I've ever done in my life. 
GUMBEL: 
 But Stacey got it done. 
STACEY: 
 I didn't think it was that bad.
GERVASE: 
 Yeah, look what happened 
 to her, though. 
They voted her off. 
 STACEY: 
 Yeah! 
GUMBEL: 
 Gervase, you had 
 a real hard time with it, 
and the minute 
 Stacey got her two down, 
you wasted no time in... 
 ejecting. 
GERVASE: 
 Oh, yeah, I spit them out. 
Yeah. 
 I... 
The idea was to take 'em, 
 throw 'em in my mouth, 
chew two times and swallow. 
When I went to swallow 'em, 
 they crawled across my mouth. 
( crowd groaning ) 
 Oh.
STACEY: 
Yeah. 
GUMBEL: 
 Stacey, what was
 your take on it?
How did... how did
 you devour them? 
You know, I just really wanted 
to kick his butt... 
and I knew I was in a precarious
 position in my group, 
and I knew that winning that 
 for them 
Uh-huh.
 might save me 
 a little longer. 
Um... 
we've already had 
the handshake here between, 
uh, Susan and Kelly. 
Yeah. 
Let me bring back some, um, 
some other 
 infamous pairings,
can we say? 
Um, Stacey and Rudy... 
sitting next 
 to each other.
Yep, Rudy and I are 
great friends now, actually. 
You know, 
we talked about this today. 
I got a T-shirt on
that says "Rudy loves Stacey." 
( laughter ) 
Good friend of mine 
 gave it to me. 
( applause ) 
Yeah. 
Um, another good pairing 
didn't get along real well: Joel
and B.B.
Who, B.B.? 
Oh, what? 
We loved each other. 
We just... 
 Oh, buddy. 
We just didn't show it. 
GUMBEL: 
 Now you do?
 Well, I guess 
you know what I think is... 
 I think that, 
you know, what, 150 years 
 from now, 
I'll be just like B.B. 
( laughter ) 
Oh... 
And I can't even comment 
on that, because 
 Years from now... 
he's so young, 
he'll never make it. 
I know that you, uh, 
you rationalized 
washing your clothes 
in the water can, 
 Sure. 
but what if Joel had done that? 
How would you've reacted? 
Well, I think he 
 did, only I think 
he went over to the water hole 
 and did it. 
But, you know, 
 we all wash our clothes 
in our drinking water,
 if you stop and think 
 about it, y-you know? 
I didn't. 
Don't you drink the water 
that-that-that... 
GUMBEL: 
In the drinking water? 
B.B.: 
 Sure, I mean, before you drink.
GUMBEL: 
 Oh, bef... 
ID: 
 Oh, oh, I never did. 
B.B.: 
 I'm not going to win 
 this argument. 
I wouldn't do it again. 
 No, you're not, 
 but that's okay.
We'll go to 
 another question. 
Yes, sir? 
 Good evening. 
While you were 
on the island, 
you were with a lot 
of crew members. 
What was that like, 
 not having any privacy? 
What was it like 
not having any privacy? 
That's what I was trying 
 to get to-- it wasn't a plug. 
If you picture 
 what you saw us doing, 
imagine the people
 behind the scenes:
the-the-the-the 
 cameramen and women,
the sound people, 
 in the torrential rains 
all 24 hours a day 
 following us around. 
They were absolutely, 
 utterly amazing. 
Unbelievable crew.
Thank you. 
( applause ) 
GUMBEL: 
Did you not... 
Did you not 
 have any privacy, 
or did you just, at 
 some point, just start
to look at them 
 as, like, plants? 
They were like trees. 
 Yeah. 
They were everywhere. 
I mean, one time, 
actually, Pagong snuck away 
to the mobile camp, 
GREG: 
Yeah, we did. 
but they found us, like, 
in three minutes. 
GREG: 
We thought we had 'em. 
We thought 
we totally fooled 'em, 
and they found us somehow. 
I don't know how. 
 They'd still
 find you? 
Yeah. 
Even though we knew 
they were videotaping us 
24/7, I-I was 
confident that... 
and I took Mark, 
 the executive director's, word 
that he wasn't 
 going to show anything-- 
you know, us going 
 to the bathroom 
or-or maybe naked if we... 
 if we didn't want to, um... 
Nothing 
 embarrassing, then.
you know, but, I mean, 
because his vision 
 that it was going to be 
that this was a family show, 
 so-so I felt confident. 
GUMBEL: 
 The only embarrassing 
 thing they show 
is that little dance 
 Rich did on the beach.
( laughter ) 
What was that? 
I have no idea. 
I don't even remember 
doing it till I saw.
GERVASE: 
That was Rudy's 
fresh and fruity day. 
RICHARD: 
 There you go. 
I mean, we-we've 
 got the tape again.
I mean, check this dance out-- 
 I mean, what do we... 
what do we call that? 
( laughter ) 
RICHARD: 
 I have no idea. 
Automatic reaction. 
 GUMBEL: 
 Hey, you know what? 
It was natural; it was real; 
 it was inspired. 
Unplanned. Thanks, Bryant. 
Let's go to another 
 question. Yes, ma'am? 
Um, my question 
is for Jenna. Um, Jenna, 
one of the saddest moments 
 on the show 
is when, um, you didn't get 
 your videotape. 
Do you regret leaving 
 your daughters behind 
 for 39 days? 
No, I don't. I regret my mom 
not getting the tape 
out in time. 
 ( laughter ) 
I made... I made the conscious 
 decision to leave them. 
Um, I was just sad 
because I didn't get my video. 
Everybody had to leave behind 
 loved ones. 
I left my two little daughters 
who are sitting 
 right over there, 
but they came out uns... 
unscarred from it, 
and they had a great time 
with Nana in the process. 
GUMBEL: 
 Um, before we 
 leave this section,
uh, which we're calling
 "Friends and Enemies," 
Rudy, I'm going to end 
 with you again, 
because, uh, I'm familiar 
with some tough comments 
you had about these folks. 
"Don't call me. 
 I won't call you." 
"These are not people 
 I'd pick as friends." 
Change your mind? 
Uh... 
not really. 
 ( laughter ) 
( cheering and applause ) 
Rudy! 
RICHARD: 
 And he means that 
 in a really kind way. 
I know!
RUDY: 
I, uh, you know, I-I hang around
 with military guys 
that don't swear 
 and all that stuff, and, uh... 
Problem is you can't 
get rid of us. 
You're stuck with us. 
That's right. 
We'll always be 
hounding you now. 
Coming to your house 
 for Christmas. 
Yep. 
I wouldn't doubt that. 
( laughter ) 
Hey, look, 
while we've been on the 
 air, we've been conducting
 a, uh, scientific poll 
to find out what you 
 and other viewers think 
about who won and who didn't. 
The first results are in. 
We're going to check 'em out 
 when we come back 
right after this. 
Maryanne and me, 
 born on a farm, 
who could do no harm, 
 but honestly, 
don't I have a little charm? 
( cheering ) 
Oh, my God!
SEAN: 
What the hell was that? 
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! 
 Who wrote that? 
BRYANT: 
 Were there any
 other lines 
to the poem 
 that we missed?
W-What's that? 
Were there any
 other lines 
to that poem 
 that we missed?
Yeah, that was just 
 a little bit of me. 
We liked the 
 hairdo then, too. 
Oh, you liked that? 
 It was pretty interesting. 
We, um, as noted, 
we ran a couple 
of poll questions this evening, 
and so we're going 
 to share the results 
with some folks who... 
um, of the 25-plus million 
 who watched you 
on a somewhat regular basis. 
Let's go to the first question. 
Did the right person 
 win tonight? 
Only 31% said yes. 
Doesn't cost 
 you anything. 
( laughing ) 
Second question-- 
 who would you have voted for? 
45% went for Rudy. 
( cheering and applause ) 
42% went to Kelly. 
Richard 11%, Susan 2%. 
RICHARD:
 Cool. 
Did the winner play fair? 
How you guessing this 
 one broke down, Rich? 
Oh... no idea.
No idea.
I imagine people
 think I didn't, 
but I truly believe
I played as fair
 and ethically as
 I could have. 
Take a look at the numbers. 
61% think you played fair. 
Awesome.
( cheering and applause ) 
And lastly, 
 this goes back to the question 
we were talking about 
 about alliances, 
and why some people 
 felt skittish about it. 
The question was, 
 for the $1 million, 
would you do 
 what the winner did to win? 
And almost half... 
Got naked? 
 That's amazing. 
Walk around naked?
( laughing ) 
If that's what
 was required. 
I think if you'd ask 
those people, 
and you'd say "If I 
guaranteed you $1 million," 
that you'd have 
about 95% of them 
would do exactly 
 what Richard did. 
BRYANT: 
 Well, you 
 know what?
We got to hand
 it to Rich. 
Up front, he said,
"I'm going to win 
 the million." 
Paycheck's already written. 
 You were certain of it. 
I played cocky. 
 In my interview tape 
and in walking 
 into CBS' interview, 
I said, 
"What are you waiting for? 
"I know you're going to pick me.
"What you don't know is 
 I'm going to win the million, 
"and what you need to know 
 for next year 
is I'm going 
 to host the next show." 
So... 
I just played cocky,
and they picked me. 
And I'm not hosting 
 the next show, so... 
And yet, the woman to your right
is the only castaway
 that never got one 
single ouster 
 vote-- not one.
RICHARD: 
 She's awesome.
BRYANT: 
 Not a one.
( cheering and applause ) 
And man, could 
 she win immunity. 
( laughter ) 
Let me talk
 about fame 
a little bit. 
Um, for how many of you 
has this show 
changed your career path? 
Your aspirations? 
Sean? 
All of us.
( everybody talking ) 
For what 
you want to do 
with your life. 
B.B.: 
I'm pretty happy. 
I wouldn't want 
to live it over. 
You know, I might not be 
 as lucky as I am now. 
I'm pretty happy. 
Change the future? 
I wouldn't want anything 
 any different. 
JOEL: 
 I think all of 
 us are just, uh...
Everything has changed 
 a little bit, 
and what success 
 we can get out of life, 
in any aspect that we choose, 
that it's just helped us 
 a little bit. 
But you're 
 moving to L.A.
to look for some
 opportunities. 
Yeah, I didn't mention that. 
I'm moving to L.A. 
Jenna moved out 
 to the coast 
 to take advantage 
of some opportunities,
 correct? 
I was going to move there 
a year ago. 
 Oh, okay. 
Sean, you're
 coming up 
on Guiding 
 Light, right?
B.B. and Stacey 
 have been in ads. 
Ramona's writing for, 
 um, E.T., right? 
Entertainment Weekly,
 I'm sorry-- E.W. 
I'd like to surf, 
and if anyone wants 
 to pay me to surf... 
I'm just putting that out there.
So... 
Hey, look, there is
 one person missing 
from this reunion-- 
 a man so familiar 
that he's almost been 
 like the 17th castaway. 
I'm talking, of course, 
 about the show's host-- 
not Richard Hatch-- 
 Jeff Probst. 
Jeff has been in Australia, 
site of next Survivor challenge 
which is set to air 
 early next year 
right after the Super Bowl. 
Tonight he's got the first look 
at what 16 new Survivor entrants
will have to outwit and outlast 
 in the outback. 
Soon 16 new strangers 
 will volunteer to be stranded 
here, 
in the Australian outback. 
This is a land 
 so vast, so remote, 
that large portions of it 
 aren't even charted. 
Certainly majestic, 
 stunning vistas, 
all sorts of exotic wildlife, 
but 39 days in this environment 
 is going to be harsh. 
The temperatures 
 will be scorching. 
And unlike Borneo, 
 the trees here 
provide very little shade. 
No relief from the heat. 
Not to mention the fact 
 that there are all sorts 
of deadly creatures 
 scampering about. 
It's going to be 
 a tough environment, 
but there is hope. 
The aboriginals have survived 
 out here for centuries, 
simply by learning to adapt, 
 and as a result, 
they're able to live in harmony 
with a land that is really 
unlike any other place on Earth.
How will the 16 survivors fare 
 in this environment? 
Who knows. 
The bigger question-- 
how will they fare 
 with each other? 
Because as we have seen, 
 surviving each other-- 
surviving the social politics-- 
is what this game is all about. 
And this time, the delicious 
but dreaded tribal council 
will take place 
high atop a beautiful waterfall 
where each week 
 the tribes will come, 
cast their ballots, and then 
 boot somebody off the island. 
The landscape may have changed, 
but the test remains the same-- 
outwit, outplay, outlast 
 to be the sole survivor. 
The first time was great. 
Can't wait to do it again. 
I'll see you in the outback. 
( cheering and applause ) 
I think it
 was Sonja 
who said that this game is 
really about surviving the vote.
Is that what it is, 
 do you think? 
Well, I think so. 
I have said that I forgot 
the "outwit" part of it. 
I had a very idealized notion 
that we should go there 
 with teamwork, 
and the ultimate survivor 
 would rise to the top, 
and we would support them. 
( imitating buzzer ): 
Not. 
And if that's what it had been--
if it had just been
 about surviving 
in the wilds, 
 who would have won? 
Greg. 
Greg. 
Gretchen. 
BRYANT: 
 We're getting a 
 lot of Gretchens. 
If we would have
 stuck together, 
I think she would definitely 
 have won, there's no doubt. 
Just from, you know, who 
 was going to vote against her? 
I think Gretchen would have. 
BRYANT: 
 She taught survival
for what, six years
 in the Air Force? 
JOEL: 
 There's no doubt. 
I think Greg. 
I think Greg
has the natural 
 instincts for it. 
BRYANT: 
 Joel's also 
 very capable. 
So are Sue
 and Kelly.
I was the big fish
 out of water. 
They did a great job 
 casting all 16 of us. 
They did do a 
 great job casting,
there's no doubt 
about that. 
We're going 
to come back 
with some final words 
 from the castaways. 
We'll do that after this. 
( cheering and applause ) 
I'm going to do 
 silly little tricks 
to entertain you, 
 make you happy-- 
things like standing 
 on their heads. 
Well, that's really me. 
But no games here, folks. 
I'm going to be myself. 
( cheering and applause ) 
Oh, my God. 
BRYANT: 
 Was that your 
 thesis at Brown?
GREG: 
 Close, very close. 
It was a partnership 
 with my sister. 
She really made it what it was. 
We've heard about 
that partnership. 
BRYANT: 
 Tell her thanks 
 for us, will you? 
Before we came 
 on the air, Rich
 came up to me, 
and he said he wanted to do 
 something before we got away 
So, Rich, 
 why don't you 
go ahead 
 and do it?
Just really quickly, 
the poll 
 that you saw the people take, 
and they talked 
 about who ought to win, 
and they picked Rudy. 
And Kelly and I 
 had a chance to be
 there at the end, 
and close the camp.
And these were 
 a couple of things
that were left in camp
that I think Marge 
 and Rudy would like.
And one is the sign that 
 said "Rowdy Rudy's Diner,"
and I want Marge
 to have it. 
And the other is 
 the clue that we got
for the immunity 
 challenge that Rudy won.
( cheering and applause ) 
BRYANT: 
 Hey, Rich...
I started 
 with you. 
I'm going to 
 end with you. 
You said on the air 
 that the million 
 would change your life.
How's it going to?
What are you
 going to do?
Um, there are a couple things 
 I've wanted to do. 
One main thing is to start 
an outdoor adventure program 
 for troubled teens-- 
something like I went on 
 when I was 18 years old. 
It's a goal that I've had 
 for a long time. 
( cheering and applause ) 
BRYANT: 
 It's really nice, 
 it's really nice. 
You're a 
 deserving winner. 
Thank you. 
You're a very 
 deserving winner. 
You played the game,
 you played it tough.
I had fun. 
 You played it upright, 
you played it smart,
and you deserve 
 big congratulations,
as do all of you. 
Thanks to all of you. 
( cheering and applause ) 
And so, it is, uh... 
so, it is time now 
for us to end 
this special tribal council, 
 only this time, 
there are no votes to cast, 
 no torches to snuff out. 
The 16 people on this stage 
 tonight began as strangers. 
But now millions of us know them
 on a first-name basis. 
Whether you view their efforts 
as some deep-seated 
 microcosm of society 
or nothing more than 
 a television game, 
there is no denying 
 their impact. 
These castaways will be 
 appearing in advertisements, 
like this one out 
 just this week, 
as well as on magazine 
 covers and in newspapers 
for some time to come. 
Tomorrow morning, some 
 even will be joining me 
on The Early Show. 
So, we'll see you then. 
On behalf of these 16 
now-familiar individuals, 
I'm Bryant Gumbel, 
 thanking you 
for being a part 
 of this reunion. 
Once again, 
 the tribe has spoken. 
Good night. 
( cheering and applause )

 theme music playing )
