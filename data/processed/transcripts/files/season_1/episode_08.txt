         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans, 
 marooned for 39 days 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Separated into two tribes-- 
 Tagi and Pagong-- 
they competed against each 
 other to remain on the island, 
but now the tribes 
 have merged into one. 
Rattana is the name, 
and it is everyone 
 for themselves. 
Every third night, 
the entire tribe will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council, 
where they must vote 
 one of their own 








off the island. 
In the end, one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 
The stakes were raised 
 for the castaways 
as the two tribes 
 merged into one. 
GREG: 
 There was a lot of baggage 
 that we left 
on that Pagong beach. 
JEFF: 
 The members of Pagong 
 were upbeat 
as they paddled to their 
 new home at Tagi beach. 
I'm excited to go to their camp 
 and meet new people. 
Rich came out and was, like, 
 "Hey, how are you?" 
You know, he swam out, 
 which was really nice. 
They welcomed us with open arms.








JEFF: 
 But the Tagi alliance 
was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I don't need to 
 deal with that. 
 After Gretch? 
Jenna. 
 Jenna. 
I was thinking Sean. 
JEFF: 
 Rudy wasn't happy 
 with the new Rattana Tribe. 
RUDY: 
 All of a sudden, 
 we doubled our population. 
Personally, 
 it's a pain in the ass. 
JEFF: 
 Greg won the first 
immunity talisman, 
ensuring that only he could not
 be voted off at Tribal Council.
Sean began 
 his alphabet voting strategy 
and to the surprise of many, 
 it was Gretchen who was ousted.
Oh, my God. 
It's me. 
JEFF: 
 Nine members of Rattana 
 are left. 
Tonight, one more will go. 
SEAN: 
 Today is, like, Day 22. 
We had a vote last night, 
 which is always pretty beat. 
Always puts us 
 in a pretty somber mood. 
But last night was 
 a very strange vote. 
Last night, it looks 
 like there was a conspiracy, 
and maybe I'm being paranoid 
and I didn't want to believe it,
but four people from Tagi 
 voted for Gretchen, I think. 
SEAN: 
 You know, the bloodbath 
 has begun, you know. 
People have started taking it 
 a different way, 
'cause there's really no good 
reason other than strategy 
to vote Gretchen off. 
GREG: 
 Gretchen distinctly disliked 
 this part of the game. 
This was her hardest thing 
was voting people off, 
and the part 
 that she liked the most 
was the survival aspect. 
GERVASE: 
 I really don't know 
 what happened last night. 
At first sight, it looks like 
 they just picked Gretchen off. 
SEAN: 
 I think that 
 my former team, Tagi, 
probably formed an alliance 
 against what they perceived 
as her... as their 
 strongest member of Pagong, 
which was Gretchen. 
It was my idea to get rid 
of Gretchen because I... 
I thought that she was going 
 to be the next leader. 
She had to go because she... 
is bright and, uh, is strong 
 and she was a threat. 
SEAN: 
 The, uh, duplicity of the whole
 thing is pretty bad, 
because I think that people 
 went out of their way 
to befriend her, and, uh... 
and those were the people who 
subsequently voted against her. 
GREG: 
 That's the game-- 
duplicitous, sleaziness-- 
if you want to play that way. 
KELLY: 
 This is a game; 
 don't take it personally. 
You know, if people came here 
 to make, you know, 
bosom buddies 
and, you know, lifelong friends,
they should've gone 
 to summer camp. 
GERVASE: 
 I think, really, 
 if it happens again, 
then you can say for sure 
 there's an alliance, 
but if it does, 
 I'm more determined than ever 
to bust that plan up and still 
kill them all and win, you know.
As far as Pagong, 
 we are now four. 
They are now five. 
They do have a voting bloc 
 on us whether we see it or not 
and they can pick us off 
 one by one. 
Who needs men? 
My best strategy 
 is to bond with the women 
and try to hold on to the 
 women's vote as long as I can. 
I'm so excited, guys. 
I don't care if you 
 vote me off now 
'cause I made it 
 to my cutoff point. 
The girls... no, 
there ain't no girls 
going for a while, 
you guys. 
Thanks, Sue. 
 That makes me 
 feel better. 
SUSAN: 
 The women seem 
 to be getting along well 
because the women 
 are all workers. 
Actually, I like Jenna better 
 than I thought I would. 
I thought she would drive me 
 wild and she doesn't, so... 
Don't worry. 
The guys' days 
are numbered. 
They are numbered. 
Us girls... us girls are 
here for a while, trust me. 
Oh, man, I love it. 
We'll be up at the end. 
I do see the women versus men 
 vote continuing on in Rattana. 
As far as my three votes, top-- 
 they're all men. 
Oh, God, you guys, 
look at these crabs. 
I see women go out, 
 get the crab traps. 
The women fix the hut. 
We're carrying the weight 
 of the team. 
Maybe that's unfair, 
 but that's how I see it. 
Ooh, look at it.
( women screaming ) 
Get him... 
 get him, Sue. 
Beat him 
 with the shoe. 
( women laughing ) 
She had me beat the 
 hell out of a crab 
with a shoe.
SUSAN: 
 As far as the women 
 becoming an alliance, 
there's a chance that the girls
might want to have an alliance 
after there's a few more guys 
 knocked off. 
If they do, 
 I'll just lead on with them 
like, 
 "Yeah, that's a good idea." 
But as far as the women 
 forming an alliance 
and making one, no. 
It ain't gonna happen. 
I already got mine. 
I like mine. 
KELLY: 
 We're all hungry 
and we're low on energy, 
 and there's still no one else 
providing any food 
 except for Rich. 
And we're having 
 to ration the rice. 
You don't have 
 to put 
both bowls on right now, Rudy, 
is what 
 I'm saying. 
Don't be 
 stubborn. 
RUDY: 
 I ain't stubborn. 
I'm going to eat 
if everybody's 
 going to eat. 
Okay, okay. 
I ain't above eating. 
Having nine people, 
 it's, uh... 
everything gets smaller again. 
The rice pot got smaller, 
the sleeping quarters 
 got smaller. 
We got four,
 five bags...
So it's four bags there, 
 so we got eight meals there 
so that's four days.
Or, no, that's only two days. 
So, a can's only going 
 to last us two days? 
We're eating that much. 
We have to ration 
it, then. 
So instead of making 
three pots tonight 
we should make two pots 
 twice a day. 
RUDY: 
When we go 
over there to eat, 
the majority rules. 
Yeah, two pots. 
SUSAN: 
 I wish some of the other people
would start conserving 
 a little more... 
people that are being pigs. 
I'll only eat one bowl 
 at a sitting. 
I'm planning on staying 
 until the end, 
so I really want 
 to have something 
for the last couple of days. 
We have our fisherman; 
 it's Rich. 
That's Rich's job. 
Oh, wow. Two? 
Four. 
Four? 
( laughing ): 
 What a catch. 
A ray, a parrot fish, 
 a catfish 
and a nice little nurse shark. 
Baby's gonna have 
 some protein today. 
GERVASE: 
 Greg showing up, going out 
 trying to spear a fish. 
They've got nothing. 
I'm not going to do 
any better than they will. 
And I think Rich 
 is in a great position. 
We vote Rich off, 
we don't eat. 
Get the torches going. 
Get everything 
 happening. 
This is big time, 
 guys. 
Rich, Rich, Rich, 
Rich, Rich! 
RICHARD: 
 Now, which one of 
 you sons of bitches 
wrote my name 
 on a card 
 last night? 
( laughing )
The bastard didn't get 
 a fish. 
Yeah, he's out of here. 
I'm starving. 
RICHARD: 
 As far as who voted for me 
at the Tribal Council 
 last night... 
and I'm not certain who it is. 
I'm thinking 
 it was probably Greg 
who felt threatened by me. 
But it could have been 
 any of them. 
I've only been with them 
 a day or two 
and I'd not brought in 
 any fish. 
Today, on the other hand 
 I brought in a huge catch. 
Three rays... 
They just lapped that up. 
That one's 
 pretty meaty. 
GREG: 
 Let's make 
 them dead 
so they can 
 stop suffocating. 
( loud smack ) 
Aah! 
You guys, I mean, 
there's no other 
humane way 
to do that? 
It seems humane to me. 
Right through its brain. 
I could eat rice 
 for 17 more days. 
I could eat rice 
 the whole time, 
but they're loving the fish 
and it seems to make people 
 feel great, 
and I squeeze every ounce 
of credit out of it that I can. 
Susie-Q, look at that, please. 
I know, 
I said 
they look 
beautiful. 
Dang, Rich! 
Those rays 
look really good. 
We're all very proud
 of you, Richie. 
It's the most fish 
 we've had. 
Good. 
Watch Susie perk up. 
She just gets a little protein 
 and she's back in the race. 
GREG: 
 Rich is playing a big game. 
I think Rich thinks 
 he's very clever. 
He has a lot of things 
 going on in his mind 
that he, uh... 
selectively decides 
 what he will share 
and with whom. 
Fear... comes from... 
That's right. 
It's useless. 
I think religion 
is what destroys
 our society. 
Whoa! 
I think it's the reason 
people treat 
other people as if 
they're lower 
 than themselves.
Rich, that's 
 ground-shaking. 
RICHARD: 
 I'm not sure 
 how Greg sees me. 
I'm trying to figure out 
 whether or not 
he's trying to build 
an alliance or pull me in 
or make me like him in some way.
GREG: 
 It's kind of weird. 
 It's good and bad. 
You should 
 give it a go. 
RICHARD: 
Thank you, buddy. 
Don't get that 
stuff near me 
with those funny faces. 
JENNA: 
 I'm seeing Greg 
 in a more devious way 
than I've ever seen him before.
Since we moved, 
I saw him change so much, 
and so transparently, 
 to me anyway, 
that I've changed 
my whole attitude towards Greg. 
GREG: 
 This scheme is interesting 
in that you make friends 
 with people, 
you make alliances 
and you have to 
 cut them loose at some point. 
JENNA: 
 Greg is working just about 
 everybody in the group. 
I think he's always had Colleen
wrapped around 
 his little finger. 
It's not like that. 
I mean, honestly, 
 if there was a girl here 
who I got along with 
 really, really well, 
it would be the same thing 
 that way. 
I feel 
like I have a friend 
and I have somebody 
 who's my equal 
that I can actually 
have a conversation with. 
Yesterday 
night... 
I'm voting for you next time. 
Fine. See 
 what happens. 
You're voting 
for me. 
GREG: 
 This is the game. 
You bring 
 this little kitty along. 
You have your little kitten, 
and you pet your kitten 
 and you enjoy this kitten 
and the kitten sleeps with you 
 every night 
and then, you're hungry, man. 
You look right 
 in the kitten's eye 
and snap its neck. 
It's nothing personal. 
 You're hungry. 
The kitten has to give its life 
 for the next level. 
What is it about your pet cat? 
My pet 
 kitten? 
Your pet kitten. 
It's you, 
 kitty. 
KELLY: 
 I see him as being a chameleon.
Changing his colors to fit 
 whoever he's around. 
RICHARD: 
 He's certainly interacted 
 with me 
in an incredibly 
 interesting way 
that suggests to me 
 that he's trying something 
that I'm very, very wary of 
 and that's great. 
JENNA: 
 Rich finds Greg attractive, 
so Rich throws these 
 little innuendoes out there 
and Greg will just pick right up
 on them, 
sit right real close to Rich 
 and he's playing him. 
Orgy, Greg? 
Orgy? 
Yeah. 
 Sure. 
Have... 
 You have? 
Oh, not right now? 
He thought it was 
an offer. 
GERVASE: 
 Greg and Rich have joked around
 a lot. 
We were talking one night. 
Rich was getting real personal 
about his business, 
 and Greg was all in it. 
You guys have never been 
 with another guy? 
No. 
Greg has. 
I mean... 
Rich, seriously?
Just kid... kid stuff. 
That's what 
 freaks me out. 
I mean... 
 well... 
 I mean... 
No, I... 
You... 
GREG: 
 I think, uh, Rich likes 
 to flirt with everybody, 
and instead of directly 
 shutting him down, 
I only played his game back. 
He's the shy one 
 on tape. 
I didn't expect that. 
I'll tell you the story later. 
RICHARD: 
 He's manipulative. 
He's trying to win me over 
 in some way. 
He's just not going about it 
in bright enough a way for me. 
I would like to spend more time 
 with him and get to know him, 
but... I would also rather have 
 the million dollars 
than to have somebody 
 like him around to worry about.
Oh, gee. 
What the hell is that? 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, man. 
"It takes skill 
 to carve the arc. 
"May your aim be true 
 and find its mark. 
"Archery is the sport of kings. 
A reward from home is 
 what victory brings." 
Oh, my, my. 
I'm never going 
to win anything 
( laughing ): 
 around here. 
Got a little bit 
of a clue. 
 Bows and arrows.
SEAN: 
 You know, if it has 
anything to do 
with something from home, 
I'd like Jenna 
to win it. 
Thank you, Sean.
I hope it's 
 my pictures.
They might have 
our family send 
a care package... 
everybody. 
They'll just give you 
the care package... 
KELLY: 
 The reward is going 
 to be something from home 
and, um, Jenna's thinking 
 it's-it's our pictures 
that we got to bring, and, like,
 she really, really... 
She misses her daughters 
 terribly. 
Aren't you excited? 
I love this stuff. 
I'm going to go home 
 and be, like 
"Oh, I got to do bows 
 and arrows." 
SUSAN: 
 Wow. 
Okay, Jenna,
 way over. 
 Too high. 
Is that how you hold it? 
( laughing ): 
Oh. 
SUSAN: 
 It's guys against girls, too, 
'cause this 
 is very even
because these 
 bow and arrows... 
and these 
 arrows are... 
none of them are straight. 
Go, Kelly. 
Keep your 
 finger over it. 
Okay, put the 
 string up. 
Now, pull her. 
Even if you want to 
keep it at a angle. 
Nice, Rudy. 
Who's on the boat? 
I think it's Jeff. 
RICHARD: 
 Bringing news 
of the competition, I bet. 
Oh, hi, Jeff. 
It better be something 
 really good. 
I'd rather have food 
 than anything 
from home right now.
I would so much 
 rather have food. 
It probably is 
 a refrigerator, 
but what are we going 
 to refrigerate, our rice? 
Maybe it's got 
 food already. 
It's ice cream 
sandwiches. 
Okay. 
( chuckles )
Move the crate. 
Perfect. 
Oh... a TV. 
Okay, now, before 
 we begin today's 
 reward challenge, 
I'm going to show you 
 some short clips of video 
sent from home. 
The winner 
of the archery 
 contest gets 
to watch their 
 entire video. 
With that...
I give you this, 
 a little something from home. 
Okay, "a little something 
from home." 
That's cool.
Hi, Dad. 
Um, I hope you're doing 
 very well. 
That's my kid. 
Aw... 
I'm doing pretty well. 
Um... I hope 
you come back with the million. 
Uh, like I said in my letter, 
I just... 
 I just wish you lots of luck. 
Yay. 
( laughing ) 
That's sweet. 
RICHARD: 
Yeah, 
that's really cool. 
It is cool. 
Okay. 
Hi, Kelly. 
Hi. 
I hope you're doing good. 
You'll probably win, 
 but I miss you anyway. 
I'm ready for you to come home. 
So, eat your rice, keep smiling 
and, uh, come home 
and let's go kayaking. 
I'm ready to go. 
Peace. 
( laughing ) 
I don't know. 
Maybe everybody in the room, 
anybody who's watching this 
 right now 
could just join in. 
You make mama real proud. 
Don't go shaming the family, 
sleeping with everybody 
 on the island. 
Just remember who loves you. 
Sis-sis... 
and she's thinking of you. 
Mmm-mmm-mmm. 
( laughing ) 
Oh, good, good. 
All right. 
I'm doing this off the top 
 of my head, so... 
That's my husband 
 holding my dog. 
Aw... 
That's my dog. 
You are me, I am you 
and you are me. 
Together, we make it 
through eternity. 
Not bad, eh? 
You know, here's Stimpy. 
He's going to come up 
 and give you a big kiss. 
Here he comes. 
( imitating airplane engine ) 
( grunting ) 
( laughing ) 
Oh, my God. 
SUSAN: 
Oh... 
my dog looks so unimpressed. 
Missing you? 
SUSAN: 
 Oh, yeah, she is. 
BOTH: 
 Hi, Colleen. 
We love you. 
SUSAN: 
Aw... 
COLLEEN: 
 That's my cat. 
( laughing ) 
This is our 
 sign-off now. 
Have fun. 
MOTHER: 
 Good luck. 
That was so cute. 
They're really cute. 
Hi, Rudy. 
I bet you're surprised 
to see me 
 on the island with you. 
45 Years. 
Just wanted to let you know 
 how much we missed you. 
Look at Grandpa. 
Hey, who is that? 
( granddaughter gurgling ) 
And whether you win or not, 
I'm proud of you 
for having been selected. 
I hope 
 you're enjoying yourself 
'cause I know you like 
 the challenge. 
Take care. 
I love you very much. 
JEFF: 
 That's a love letter. 
Yeah. 
All right. 
It was nice. 
SEAN: 
Aw, there's my sister. 
Yeah, that's the... 
We call that the blue bomb. 
( crash ) 
WOMAN: 
 You think he'll notice? 
ALL: 
 We miss you, Sean. 
Come home soon... 
but not too soon. 
Good luck. 
Aw. 
That was nice. 
Hi, Daddy. 
Baby! 
Oh, look. 
Oh, she's beautiful. 
Tell Daddy. 
 Who's the man? 
Daddy! 
Oh, she's so cute. 
Do it real loud. 
Wha-zup! 
Wha-zup! 
Say, bye-bye, Daddy. 
Bye-bye, Daddy. 
Bye-bye, baby. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God, 
 that's cute.
Not too bad. 
Oh, she's beautiful.
That's my heart and my soul, 
 everything right there. 
Mom's beautiful, too. 
You shouldn't have 
shown me that, man. 
JEFF: 
 Well, it breaks 
 my heart 
to say this,
 Jenna. 
Oh, don't tell me. 
We never received 
 a tape back. 
And I'm really sorry. 
Oh, man.
Are we going to do 
 the archery now? 
JEFF: 
 Well, there is 
 an upside to this 
that still 
 includes you. 
The reward for 
 today's challenge 
 is two parts. 
One is a private screening 
for the full tape. 
The winner also gets to make 
 their own video postcard 
and send it home. 
And that one, Jenna,
I can guarantee you 
 will get there 
'cause I'll put it 
 in the overnight 
 myself tomorrow. 
So, one person's going to get 
the whole kit and caboodle 
 tonight 
and the others are going 
 to get nothing else. 
Okay, so you're going 
to get one arrow, 
 that's it. 
Remember, the 
 one who shoots 
 their arrow 
closest to the bull's-eye, 
gets to see 
 their entire video 
and make one
of their own. 
You guys 
 comfortable?
Nice. 
Greg is on the mark. 
I'll let you handle this. 
The split... 
Yeah, I'm 
 worried about that. 
Good try. 
Yay. You hit 
the board. 
Oh, I wanted 
 to see my daughters. 
Go, Rudy. 
Make it count. 
Well, this ain't my bag. 
JEFF: 
Greg's still looking 
good right now. 
Close... 
 but no cigar. 
Come on, Sue. 
You guys... 
JEFF: 
 Tim's waiting 
 to hear. 
Waiting to hear 
 from you. 
Well... not close. 
Good luck, Kelly. 
Good try. 
Great try. 
Nice try. 
Mom and Dad 
would love 
to hear from 
you, Colleen. 
Good velocity. 
All right, Gervase, 
no big deal. 
Come on, for 
your little girl. 
The entire... 
Nice try, 
Gervase. Nice try. 
Okay, Rich. 
Let's go, Richie. 
Dead-Eye Rich. 
Here he goes. 
Last shot. 
It's up to you. 
No. 
Congratulations, man. 
Wait a minute. 
Congratulations, Greg. 
Thanks, guys. 
JEFF: 
 So Greg is going
 back up there 
and watch his tape. 
You can include 
 these guys if you want. 
You can do whatever 
 you want with it. 
Of course. 
If it's going to be funny, 
which I figured it would, 
I thought other people might 
 get a kick out of it. 
At least she could provide 
entertainment for other people. 
Mukaluka, mau-mau, ping-ping. 
( clicking tongue ) 
How are you doing? 
I miss you very much. 
( kissing sounds ) 
That's right, ping-ping. 
RICHARD: 
 I didn't think Greg's tape 
 was unusual. 
I expected that 
and was excited by it. 
You could tell 
she was having fun 
and knew he would laugh 
 at what she was doing 
and I was laughing. 
 I loved it. 
Any circumstance 
 you find yourself in, 
you're not sure what to do-- 
 you're in a quandary; 
you're in a pickle; 
you're in a bind; 
think what Billy Joel would do. 
Think about it. 
( laughing ) 
Think, what would Billy Joel do?
Anything. 
Let's talk about 
 who's probably 
sleeping on the island 
 right now. 
All the giant, 
scary spiders are sleeping. 
That's how mom used to put us 
 to sleep at night. 
All the animals are sleeping. 
You make Mom proud. 
You make Mom real proud. 
Just remember who loves you. 
Sis-sis. 
( kissing sounds ) 
( silly grunting ) 
SEAN: 
 I definitely see Greg 
 differently now 
after seeing his video 
and attaching a lit bit 
 of a family with him. 
At least we know 
he's not the only screwball 
 in his family. 
Maybe it's a genetic trait 
 over there. 
You're on, buddy. 
Okay. 
Hi, Julie. 
I just want to say, 
 you know, 
it was really special 
for you to send me 
and everybody here 
what you did. 
We feel like we could feel you 
and we felt you.
Some of us felt you 
and others just imagined 
 what it's like to feel you. 
RUDY: 
 I can't understand a guy 
 talking to his sister that way.
It sounded like Greg 
 was talking, maybe, incest. 
That's the way it sounded to me.
( laughing ) 
Why not make allusions? 
It crosses all those borders. 
And, God, what are people 
 going to think? 
And then, sexual allusions 
 for my sister? 
What's gonna happen? 
Julie, we got to put up with 
 this for about two more weeks 
and, uh, then we
 might kill him. 
Is that doing 
 you a favor? 
( laughing ) 
Good work, Rudy. 
Good job, Rudy. 
RUDY: 
Yeah. 
JENNA: 
 I can't imagine 
anybody missing their kids 
 more than I do every night. 
Miss my beauties. 
Miss Sadie and Sabrina. 
I can't imagine my mom 
 not getting the tape out. 
It would've done wonders 
 to see that my kids are okay. 
To hear their voices. 
To hear, "I love you, Mommy." 
RICHARD: 
 Yesterday was cool. 
We had that reward challenge 
 with the bow and arrow 
and the reward was, the, uh... 
videotapes from home, 
and for me, 
 that was way better than food. 
GERVASE: 
 Now, seeing those videos of 
 everybody's family, it's, like,
even if you didn't 
 like somebody before, 
you see that somebody 
 cares and loves this person, 
so it makes it harder for me 
 to boot somebody off now. 
KELLY: 
 I felt so bad for Jenna. 
She practiced all morning 
 on that stupid bow and arrow 
and then it was just, like, 
 "Why bother" for her. 
Those are my bruises 
 from the bow and arrow. 
This is from the bow and arrow. 
GREG: 
 I don't know 
 what her feeling is 
because now it seems like 
 she wants to leave the island 
and see her girls. 
This is going to make it 
that much easier 
when I do get kicked off. 
I'm going to probably cry, 
 but you know what? 
Then I'm going to get off 
 and go... 
"What an adventure!" 
And then I get to go home 
to my kids, so... 
GERVASE: 
 Jenna is a threat to me 
 because she has kids 
and I have kids, so we're, 
 like, single parents, 
and if people feel 
 for single parents 
and she's tugging on 
 people's emotions right there 
and that can sway somebody 
 not to vote for Jenna, 
and that's a threat for me. 
Gervase? I don't see him 
 doing very much. 
SUSAN: 
 The fact you have 
 more people here now 
and we're having to forage 
 for more food 
and there's a lot more slackers 
 on this other team. 
SUSAN: 
 Gervase. He's a nice guy. 
I don't like feed...
 I don't like feeding
people like that, 
 though, you know 
 what I mean? 
 Yeah. 
That's where I'm...
 That's where I'm 
 coming from now. 
GERVASE: 
 My work philosophy is this: 
Rich is, like, 
 the resident fisherman; 
Rudy's the cook; 
Sean is hauling in wood 
 every day-- 
you know, it seems like 
 everybody has a role here-- 
and I'm just sitting back 
 relaxing. 
Watch me-- I'm going to work 
 that boy till he's gone now. 
He bugs me. 
GREG: 
 Gervase is honest. 
He's not playing 
anybody else's game. 
I've said over and over 
that he was an example 
for people 
 thrown out of their element 
to really succeed and have 
a great time, which Gervase has.
I got a king. 
( laughing )
GERVASE: 
 How have I survived this long? 
I always said when I came here,
I was going to be 
 the entertainer. 
The cards man-- 
I'm glad you brought them. 
It adds a new dimension 
 to island life. 
GERVASE: 
 I'm not trying to do anything 
shifty or shady; 
 I'm just being me 
and people like me 
 because that's who I am. 
Gervase is not that charming, 
 trust me. 
He's a slacker, 
so he won't be around long. 
Hey.
"Pull me." 
Oh, look at this. 
"If you want to win immunity 
"at the next challenge, 
just slip onto the right rope 
 and run." 
"Beware of dead ends. 
"The prize you seek... 
"is waiting... 
at the end of the line." 
Wow, that 
sounds hard. 
A significant amount of luck 
with this one. 
Oh, you've got 
to love that. 
At least this way, 
 I have a chance. 
JEFF: 
 Day 24 on the island. 
Since the merger, 
 nothing has been more important
than voting strategy. 
The gears are churning. 
Nobody is safe. 
The only way to stay 
 in this game: 
win today's immunity challenge. 
JEFF: 
Here we are-- 
immunity time... again. 
"Into the Line" is a rope course
designed to be confusing. 
It's a jungle rope maze with 
 five checkpoints along the way.
Your job is to collect 
the colored carabiners 
at every checkpoint. 
Here's the only hiccup: 
you have to be attached 
to the rope course at all times 
with your carabiner-- 
 you have two of them. 
At certain points, you're going 
to come to a junction-- 
 these trees. 
You can't get past them. 
Take your other carabiner, 
reattach... 
then you can un-attach... 
now spin around, maneuver, 
however you want to do it. 
The only thing 
 you have to keep in mind 
is one of these 
has to be on at all times. 
Also at each checkpoint 
 are several ropes 
that lead directly 
to the next checkpoint, 
but several ropes 
 lead to dead ends. 
If you hit a dead end, 
you've got to backtrack 
 to your last checkpoint 
and choose a new line. 
The first person 
 to reach the end of the course 
with five carabiners 
gets immunity. 
The tighter, the better? 
Survivors, ready... 
go! 
What's happened to us? 
We're idiots! 
Oh, dude. 
( cheering ) 
Nice work, man. 
Wow! 
Congratulations.
Give me five! 
Yank it down. 
Very good. Very good. 
Yes! 
Well earned. 
Yes! 
KELLY: 
 I knew coming here that 
 we'd have to vote people off. 
What I didn't bank on 
 was the feelings 
that you'd have 
 towards these people. 
I feel like I feel 
 every Tribal Council 
only it gets worse 
 every time. 
I feel like a backstabber. 
I feel like a liar. 
God, some people 
are so nervous, it's sick. 
It's sick how nervous 
 some people are. 
RUDY: 
 People are all looking 
 around a little more 
because it's starting 
 to get down to the wire, 
and evidently, 
 we're the only ones 
with a plan right now. 
Once it's past the 
 next council, 
we're invincible. 
Right now we're 
not invincible. 
The voting now 
 should get very interesting. 
If people are fear- and 
 self-preservation motivated, 
they'll band together. 
They'll form alliances. 
They'll start beating 
 people out. 
Fear-motivated 
 self-preservation 
is the worst game 
 I can imagine. 
KELLY: 
 How do you, you know, 
 stay true to yourself 
and maintain integrity 
and still play this game? 
And you know what? You can't. 
Yeah, I think that 
 would look better. 
Yeah, tell Rudy that. 
RUDY: 
 It's cut and dried that we can 
eliminate somebody every time, 
 and if we don't, 
I'll have to break 
somebody's kneecap or something.
SUSAN: 
 So as long as everybody 
 can keep their mouth shut now. 
Kelly's a little freaky. 
She's gets a little going. 
I'm like, "Just shut up. 
Just vote this, and shut up." 
KELLY: 
 I keep telling myself 
"Well, I have enough friends. 
I didn't come here 
to make friends," and da-da-da. 
And the truth is, 
 I like these people. 
GERVASE: 
 This is a game. 
You're allowed to do this. 
This is a game. 
Alliances are fair game. 
My thing is, we should always 
 have the upper hand. 
We should've voted Rudy... 
We should have voted 
 for Rudy at first 
and then, next vote, 
vote your conscience. 
Always keep the upper hand 
because if they try something, 
 you can stop it. 
SUSAN: 
 As far as there being 
 a counterstrategy 
from the other side, yeah, 
 there is some fear about that 
because we haven't got 
 enough of them voted off yet. 
COLLEEN: 
 We have 
 the upper hand right now, easy.
We have four people 
 that we could come together 
have a vote, and get 
 the next person off. 
Welcome to Tribal Council 
 number eight. 
You guys are now 
the final core group of nine. 
Two of you will make it, 
 survive long enough to get 
to the final vote. 
The other seven of you 
will return to be 
 the jury that delivers 
that vote, so no matter 
 who gets voted off, 
from this point forward,
 when they get voted off,
we'll all be back here 
in 15 days to determine 
 who leaves with $1 million. 
So, Richard, 
 bearing that in mind, 
how do you balance 
 the ruthlessness 
required to get 
to the final two 
with the likability needed 
 to get the final vote? 
Good question. 
I'm not even exactly sure 
 what my strategy's going to be 
as to who I'm going to vote for 
 from week to week. 
I'm just going 
to keep getting fish 
feeding people-- 
 hope they're happy. 
How about 
 you, Gervase? 
You're wearing immunity; 
 tonight you're fine. 
Same thing applies to you. 
How do you find that balance? 
Just... I'm winging it. 
Every day out here, 
 I'm just winging it. 
I like everybody here, you know,
and after seeing their videos 
 of their families, 
I can put faces 
 with them now. 
I see they have 
loved ones like I do 
caring about them, 
rooting for them, 
 so it makes it a lot harder. 
Jenna, how surprised
 were you last week 
to see Gretchen 
 get voted off? 
I was very surprised. 
I would've thought she would 
 have made it to the final two, 
but when we merged, 
 strategies had to shift 
and it looked like they 
 were getting rid of leaders, 
so, from here on out, 
 if I get voted off, 
I'll wear it 
 like a badge of honor 
when I walk 
down there. 
Susan, straight up, 
 is there an alliance? 
No, not that I... 
I vote people off 
 that I don't care for, 
you know, that really would 
 irritate me if I was 
working with them at a job 
 or something like that. 
Here, I got a chance 
 to vote them off. 
I can get rid of them. 
It's, like, yeah! 
Kelly, same question. 
Do I have to answer? 
I'm just kidding. 
Has your voting strategy changed
now or will it change tonight? 
I vote for who I don't 
 particularly like. 
I vote for who I don't want 
to spend the next 15 days with. 
Colleen, would you do 
 whatever it takes 
to get this money? 
Would you play sides
 against each other? 
No. 
Just not important 
 enough? 
Right. 
What brought you here 
 if it's not the money? 
I mean, I'm here 
for the money, too. 
I mean, give me a break. 
 Of course. 
But the thing is that 
everybody's here for the money, 
 you know? 
I'm not going to listen 
to everybody's sob stories 
and then weigh them. 
That's ridiculous. 
Everybody wants the money. 
All right. Gervase? 
 It's time to vote. 
My vote is for Jenna. 
I think she's really missing
 her kids now. 
She didn't get 
 the videotape. 
There's not a letter for her, 
so, you know, I think 
 it's really hurting her, 
so this is her ticket. 
Keeping with my strategy 
 of alphabetical order, 
I'm voting for Greg tonight. 
It would have been 
Gervase's turn, but he won 
immunity, so I had to skip him. 
Next person in order is Greg. 
I don't think this vote is 
 going to mean very much. 
First time for paranoia, 
second time for irritation 
and third time because 
my ear infection is clearing up.
? Good night, sweetheart, 
yeah, it's time to go. ? 
No more competition.
Talk to you later, Greg. 
 Bye-bye. 
As always I'd like to remind you
that once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final 
and the person will be asked 
to leave the island immediately.
I'll read the votes.
"Jenna."
"Jenna."
"Jenna." 
"Greg." 
"Greg." 
"Greg." 
Three votes for Greg, 
 three votes for Jenna. 
"Greg." 
"Greg." 
No! 
( mock sobbing ) 
JEFF: 
 Take care, Greg.
That's all I need. 
Bye, everyone. 
Greg, the tribe 
 has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go. 
Bye, everybody. 
( sobbing ) 
( laughter ) 
RUDY: 
I believed him 
for a minute. 
RICHARD: 
You believed him, Rudy? 
For a minute there. 
When the tears fell.
Look at the tears 
 back there. 
That's it 
 for tonight's Tribal Council. 
I'll see you guys tomorrow. 
Good night. 
Next week on Survivor: 
I'm just being honest. 
If you can't take 
the honesty... 
Cracks begin to appear 
 in the alliance. 
I'm hoping that Kelly hasn't 
joined forces 
 with somebody else. 
Someone will win a letter 
 in the reward challenge. 
Will Jenna finally hear 
 from her children? 
JENNA: 
 I want the letter from home. 
I haven't seen or heard 
 anything from my kids. 
A twist of fate 
that maybe some 
didn't expect 
and some... well... 
some did. 
An excellent game, 
 well manufactured. 
I harbor no resentment 
 for any of you 
who voted for me, 
 against me or otherwise. 
I feel like it's 
 probably a pretty 
 darn good time. 
Thanks, guys.
