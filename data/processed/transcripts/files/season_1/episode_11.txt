         ANNOUNCER: 
 Last week on Survivor: 
Rich woke up with 
 a Tribal Council hangover... 
I got bombarded at the council. 
A little alliance tried 
to attack Richie 
 on my birthday. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 So he decided to fight back 
 by catching fewer fish. 
And I'm, like, you backstabbers,
 Colleen and Gervase. 
First, you want him out of here
and then you're 
 all over the food. 
Uh... 
ANNOUNCER: 
 But Sue did some backstabbing 
 on her own... 








I never trusted Rich. 
He's a snake. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 And cracks appeared 
 in the alliance. 
Making a deal with Rich is 
kind of like 
 making a deal with the devil. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 But it was Rich 
 who burned the competition... 
Yeah! 
ANNOUNCER: 
 And won the big prize, 
 immunity. 
Unable to vote for Rich 
 at the council, 
Sue and Kelly stuck 
 with the alliance 
and sent Gervase packing. 
JEFF PROBST: 
 Gervase. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 Only six remain. 
Who will be voted off tonight? 








( birds chirping ) 
RICH: 
 Just woke up. 
I'm wet. 
So, I guess it rained 
 last night, 
but I slept through it. 
Today is the... 31st day... 
I think. 
All I know is, this is 
 the ninth day till the end. 
KELLY: 
 People were kind of miserable 
 this morning. 
I was one of the miserable. 
I mean, every day's 
 a little tough because... 
we don't have a lot to do 
 and we're-we're low energy. 
Rich has gotten really, 
 really weak 
and really crabby 
 and really hungry 
an-and Sean also. 
I got to try 
 to put on some weight 
before I go home. 
Everyone's telling
 me I look ugly. 
The food I miss, 
 but not as much as my parents. 
The hardest part, uh, for me, 
 about being here, um 
is that I miss my family 
and, uh... like I've reiterated 
 a thousand times over 
I'm no mama's boy, 
 but I'd really like 
to see my family. 
It would mean 
 an enormous amount to me. 
When you think of their smiles 
and their hugs 
 and stuff like that, 
I just can't wait to see them. 
( birds squawking ) 
KELLY: 
 Colleen's legs are 
 pretty beat up. 
She's gotten 
 some pretty bad gashes 
and she has some sores 
 up higher on her legs 
that she doesn't know 
 how she got. 
COLLEEN: 
 My legs are bothering me. 
I mean, I would be lying 
if I said my legs 
 aren't bothering me. 
They-they hurt a lot. 
I have all these 
and then, I have these new ones.
I can't sleep 
because they itch so bad. 
So, I get a scar 
 and then I itch it off 
and it... and it's just like 
 this never-ending cycle 
and they're going 
 to be like this 
for the next three years, 
 you know? 
And bugs live in them. 
I mean, it's just awful. 
It's so awful. 
I am feeling like 
 I've been here for 59,000 days.
The past five days have been 
the longest five days 
 of my entire life. 
I miss my old team. 
? ? 
I miss my old beach, you know? 
I am the last sole survivor 
 of the Pagong Tribe. 
I am a dying breed. 
Pagong gets picked off 
 one by one. 
That's obvious. 
Now, I'm very confused 
at where alliances stand, 
and I think they're confused 
at where alliances stand. 
RICH: 
 Try and follow all this. 
I'm going to give you 
 all of what's happened.
COLLEEN: 
 Rich and Sue are promising 
 one thing to Sean... 
promising another thing 
 to Kelly. 
Sue and Kelly are promising 
 one thing to Rich... 
promising another thing to Sean,
and then, Rudy just sits back 
and watch it all happen. 
RICH: 
 It seems like Kelly 
 might be flip-flopping 
and planning strategies 
 at our expense 
and that just ticked Sue off 
 to no end. 
Kelly is staying 
 in the alliance at this time, 
but she's trying 
to make herself look good 
to the other team 
in case it comes 
 down to the end, 
and she's 
 one of the last two standing 
that she will be, like, 
 "Oh, I didn't align with them,"
and we're, like, 
"This time, no, baby doll. 
You're not going to look good." 
I'm here to play the game. 
I'm going to play the da... 
 game. 
I don't give a rat's ass 
 what people think about me. 
I don't have to prove 
 anything to anybody. 
I know who I am. 
So, who cares? 
COLLEEN: 
 That's what's so interesting 
 about this 
is, I'm getting to see 
 the breakdown 
of the Tagi alliance, 
 which is really funny. 
Everybody is very concerned 
 of the money at this point. 
Like Sean would say, 
 "It's a one-in-six chance 
of winning $1 million" 
and nobody's going 
 to throw that away. 
They'll be gunning for us 
 if they're not already. 
I think they are. 
We'll beat them, man. 
There comes a point 
where you have to turncoat 
 a little bit, 
be a little more strategic, 
a little more 
 self-preservative. 
It's a serious contest. 
There's a lot 
 of money at stake 
and, uh, I'd better 
 start treating it that way. 
No one's here just to 
 make friends and shake hands 
and have relationships 
for the rest of the time. 
Where's-where's 
 Kelly and, uh, Sue?
They went for wood. 
They went for wood--
 that way? 
That way. 
So, now, it's you and 
 me to the end, period.
I've given you my word.
You know, 
if-if I got ( no audio ) 
along the way 
like somebody had gave me 
the word, 
I'd do something 
to them. 
You're the only one
I've been able to trust
 from the beginning. 
And you can 
right to the end. 
Right. 
COLLEEN: 
 This is definitely what happens
when you put a big chunk 
 of cheese in a maze 
and let all the mice go at it, 
 you know? 
And see who eats who 
 and who scrambles on top of who
and I don't want to be 
 any part of it. 
It's... not a fun game, no. 
KELLY: 
What does it say? 
"Survivor Trivia."
"This time, it's not 
"your muscles you'll strain 
"for tomorrow's event. 
you'll workout your brain." 
RUDY: 
 Well, we got a clue last night 
and, uh, it says you can use 
 your brain, not your muscles, 
which is good news. 
Not that my brain's any good, 
 but, uh... 
I'd rather use that 
 than my muscles 
'cause the muscles hurt now. 
Yeah, I suck at trivia, 
but I love it 
'cause I fi... 
you know? 
And I'm real slow 
at the buzzer, 
but you know 
what I was thinking 
before I went 
to bed last night? 
I was thinking, 
"It's going to be 
just like a game show. 
This is going 
to be so cool," 
and then, I was like, 
"Wait a minute. 
We're on a game show." 
My friends, today...
decadence speaks. 
Oh, we're liking this.
We've taken the visa
 and created a really
 cool night tonight 
for one of you. 
Oh! No, come on.
One night... 
on a yacht... 
That yacht! 
That yacht.
( laughter ) 
You got your TV 
and your stereo, sure. 
You got your 
 luxury dinner...
Oh, my God. 
With your waiter, 
fresh sheets, beautiful bed 
and a hot, hot shower. 
Pretty simple-- 
 you guys are going
to start at the end-- 
A-B-C... 
 all the way through... 
true/false 
 or multiple choice. 
You're going to start 
 on the blue squares. 
As you 
 answer questions correctly, 
you move forward 
 through the different colors. 
Now, if you're the last
 one left on a color 
that the others have 
 already moved beyond, 
 you're out of the game.
First one on the mat
gets the night
 on the yacht. 
Let's do it.
Take your spots.
For a night on the yacht, 
 here we go. 
"True or false-- 
"pound for pound, insects are 
a better source of protein 
 than beef?" 
Stare straight ahead. 
Everybody take a step forward. 
You are right. 
Almost 80% of an insect 
 is good for protein. 
All right. 
"What must be done to water 
"collected from inside 
 green bamboo 
"before it's safe to drink? 
"A) nothing 
"B) it must be strained, 
 C) it must be boiled 
or D) it must be distilled." 
"Nothing" is right. 
If it's inside the bamboo, 
 it's okay. 
Richard, you had it. 
Rudy, Colleen, step forward. 
Kelly. 
What? 
Oh, sh... 
You're out, buddy.
Bad!
"If you do not have water, 
 you should 
"A) not sleep, 
"B) not eat, 
"C) stay on your feet 
or D) stay active?" 
Everybody, move a step forward. 
"Not eat," because digestion 
 removes even more fluid. 
Susan... 
I'm sorry. 
 Yeah? 
Yeah, I was just saying... 
 yeah... 
Last one. 
JEFF: 
 Join your pal Kelly. 
"True or false-- 
"if you eat a poisonous mushroom
and survive the first 24 hours, 
you have a 90% chance 
 of full recovery?" 
Richard, move into the lead. 
That is false. 
Some mushrooms, in fact, 
you recover from 
 in the first 24 hours 
and then die 
 two to ten days later. 
Oh, baby! 
I can still see the boat 
through the fog, Jeff. 
"What is the longest 
 venomous snake in the world-- 
"A) king cobra, 
"B) giant sea snake, 
"C) reticulate python 
or D) Kinabalu pit viper?" 
Sean, move up with Richard. 
It was "A) the king cobra." 
"True or false-- the dangerous 
female black widow spider 
"is identified 
 by a blue hourglass pattern 
on her abdomen?" 
What's the right answer, 
 Richard? 
Red-- 
 "false."
 Red. 
You and Sean 
 move forward. 
We have a showdown.
( groaning ) 
Colleen and Rudy, 
 sorry, guys. 
"Which of the following 
 can you drink 
"to kill intestinal parasites-- 
"A) distilled water, 
"B) mango juice, 
"C) kerosene, 
"D) ginger ale?" 
Both ready? 
Yeah. 
 Richard, you really 
 wanted that, didn't you?
Did I lose it? 
Sean, congratulations.
"C) kerosene."
Oh, I thought 
that would kill you. 
Good job. 
JEFF: 
 Sean, 
congratulations. 
That yacht right there 
 is all yours-- 
one night, hot shower, 
 hot towels 
and everything else 
 we talked about. 
Way to go, man.
Good job, Seanie. 
Oh, Sean, here's one 
 more thing to consider.
One other person may
 be able to join you 
for breakfast 
 on that yacht.
So, I'll let that 
 sort of ruminate in your head 
as you... contemplate 
 this whole thing. 
Otherwise, it's going 
 to be a great night. 
Party on the boat. 
Whoo! 
Listen... 
SEAN: 
 Yesterday, I won a challenge-- 
 an island trivia contest. 
The reward to the challenge 
 was lucky for me, is a night 
on this luxurious yacht. 
I understand 
 there's going to be food 
I hope dessert, a warm shower, 
 television, maybe a newspaper. 
But, uh, hopefully I'll get 
 to bring some company with me. 
If I'm allowed one person, 
I owe Kelly a dinner, 
 so she's coming with me. 
I really like Sean. 
I've probably talked a lot 
 of trash about Sean 
'cause he's neurotic 
 and talks a lot, 
but he's really a good guy. 
If he does get 
 to bring one person, he said 
he's going to bring me, 
so I'm a little stoked up 
 about that. 
I might get to go spend 
 a night on a yacht, 
which would be cool 
because if I could spend 
 a night on a yacht 
and shower and eat some food, 
I'd be good to go 
 for another seven days. 
( distant thunder rumbling ) 
SEAN: 
 This is an ungodly 
 type of rain 
that we're not used to 
 in the States. 
You know, I've seen some heavy 
 rain-pours in New York City, 
but this is heavy, heavy rain, 
 I mean, serious rain. 
This is really horrible. 
Survival of the fittest-- 
who can stand under an umbrella
 in the rain the longest. 
But that piece-of-crap 
 parachute thing 
has been the most waterproof 
 thing we've had 
on this whole island, 
 so a lot of people 
have been crowding up 
 underneath that. 
COLLEEN: 
 Today it's raining. 
Last night was raining, 
and I think tomorrow 
 it will probably be raining. 
This is definitely
the worst day. 
SEAN: 
Definitely the worst day by far.
And it's really bad because 
it's probably going to be 
 like this tomorrow. 
SUSAN: 
 As far as the rain, 
well, I think it was a big 
 deterrer on a lot of people. 
Really kind of ate at 'em. 
Oh, my God. 
I don't know if I'd want 
to live with some of them 
 right now. 
Might be ornery, tired, 
 hungry, cold... 
the quickest way. 
It beats driving a semi 
 through Chicago 
at 4:00 on a Friday 
 summer afternoon. 
KELLY: 
 Thank God for the sun. 
The sky's really clear 
and everybody's drying out 
 and warming up. 
Good stuff. 
That's a great rainbow. 
Pretty. 
Hey, Jeff! 
Check out the rainbow 
 you came in under. 
Wow! 
That is great!
 Whoo! 
What's 
 happening, Jeff?
Well, I wish I was 
coming here to say 
that everybody was going 
on the yacht. 
So do we. 
Yeah, we do, too. 
Let's go. 
See you, buddy.
Guys... 
 Enjoy. 
See you in the morning. 
See you guys tomorrow. 
 Bye, Rude. 
 Have fun. 
See you guys. 
Bye, guys. 
 Sorry you're not coming. 
SUSAN: 
 Sean finally leaves 
to go off 
 to his yacht excursion 
and then he hollers out 
"Hey! I can invite somebody 
 for breakfast!" 
I can invite someone 
for breakfast. 
Who wants it? 
Take her. 
Kelly, do you want that 
to be your meal? 
Sean, it's your decision. 
Don't pawn it off on me. 
Yeah, Sean, get some balls 
Decide. 
 and make a decision! 
Richie, scrambled eggs 
tomorrow morning. 
JEFF: 
We'll see you 
in the morning, hatch. 
Sean makes up his mind 
 and he invites Rich. 
Tomorrow, Rich. 
You need a boost. 
KELLY: 
 Sean kept saying 
 how he was going to take me 
and then, last minute 
he said, "Oh-- oh, Rich, 
"you like eggs for breakfast, 
 don't ya? 
Okay, me and you, Rich. 
 I'll take you." 
SUSAN: 
 The guy's dumb.
So dumb. Is he not? 
Hi. 
? ? 
Sean is probably eating 
 lots of food. 
I wonder if he got pizza. 
KELLY: 
 You know, we're all hungry 
and tired and dirty 
 and bored... 
He'll probably shave and bathe. 
Ah... 
Maybe he might get a massage. 
I don't think he's ever had 
 a massage. 
Oh, that feels so good, yeah. 
I just hope the poor kid doesn't
 make a fool out of himself. 
Does my ass look as bony 
 as it feels? 
JEFF: 
 The captain-- he's not going 
 to be steering all night. 
He's going to go to sleep. 
I just wanted to introduce him 
 to you. 
Just for, you know... 
But this guy just really 
 wanted to say hi 
and, you know, he's 
familiar with the show. 
He's certainly familiar 
with you and everything 
that's going on, 
so come on in and take 
the oars or whatever. 
Hi... Captain... 
Captain! 
Hey, Dad! 
Oh, my God!
Holy Toledo!
How's my boy? 
Oh, Pops, I love ya!
I miss ya! 
I love you, too, son. 
Oh, my God! 
You look fantastic.
Oh, my God. 
 Did I tell ya that?
I can't believe you
 got my father here.
Oh, my God, Dad, you 
 made my whole adventure.
Hey, shrimp. 
I cannot tell you 
how much more 
 this is worth 
than a million
 dollars to me.
I can't... 
Money's nothing. 
SEAN: 
 I thought the reward 
ample enough to spend 
 a night on a yacht 
and get a massage, a shower, 
 a shave... 
and to see my father then, 
I mean it was just 
 a dream come true. 
So, so much.
He's got his heart
twice as big 
 as this body. 
It's twice as big as your body. 
It's the truth, son. 
I'd walk 
 on nails, coals,
I don't care. Anything. 
Yeah, me, too. Me, too. 
I don't know why 
 the bond's so strong. 
It is. 
We got a very strong bond. 
You're the best, Dad. 
Your dad is looped. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Have my wine. 
I am so happy right now. 
? ? 
I just wish Sean would... 
just get a backbone sometimes. 
It irks me the way he tried 
 to put it on me. 
Like, "I'm going to bring you, 
"but you can pass it on 
to Rich if you want to," 
like he didn't want 
 to be the .... 
you know, he didn't want 
 to have to make the decision 
that was his to make. 
It's dawn 
 and I'm looking at the yacht 
and Sean's probably 
 still sleeping. 
But it won't be long 
before they come get me 
 for breakfast. 
Rich, get your skinny 
 ass up here. Let's go.
My skinny ass. 
Oh, I love it. 
Hey, tell Sean 
 he's in big trouble. 
Tell Sean he's got 
 to deal with Wiglesworth
when he gets back.
Oh, that'll, that'll 
 spoil his whole morning.
Hey. 
And she's hungry. 
KELLY: 
You know, it's not 
even the food. 
I don't give 
a ... about the food. 
It's the point that 
he's been going on 
and on and on... 
SUSAN: 
 About how he screwed
 you out of a meal. 
How he screwed me 
 and he owes me. 
And then when it comes down 
 to it, he can't even ... 
he's a ..., man. 
So where's Sean at?
RICHARD: 
Hey! 
There he is. 
Hey, captain. 
I take it 
it's captain. 
That's his captain,
 all right. 
Did you have 
a good night? 
SEAN: 
 I know you 
 needed something 
to pull you out 
 of your doldrums. 
This is going 
to do it, buddy. 
Off we go.
Sean, hey. 
Nice shower and everything. 
My pleasure. 
Good to see you.
Meet the captain. 
How are you 
 doing, sir? 
He's also known 
as Jim Kenniff, 
my father. 
That's my father 
from New York. 
It's not! 
Jim, all right!
Isn't that wild? 
Holy Moses!
It was good. 
It was enjoyable. 
I just kept eating 
 while they talked 
and answered questions 
 as I chewed. 
JIM: 
 It was rocking for me.
SEAN: 
 We had an hour
 boat ride here
and then we polished off
 two bottles of wine. 
We confessed how much 
 we loved each other 
and all that good 
father-son stuff. 
Oh, my God. 
Just dump it out. 
This is all
your guys' food.
What is this? 
 Cinnamon rolls?
Yes. 
Thanks for picking 
me, Sean. 
Cheers. 
Cheers. 
Nice to meet 
you, Dad. 
No worries. 
SUSAN: 
 Six more days of rice. 
I might even skip the last day 
 of eating altogether 
just not to eat rice. 
Mexican food. 
Shrimp fajitas... 
chips and salsa. 
Guacamole... 
and enchiladas. 
COLLEEN: 
 Sean is seeing that he's 
 in a little bit of trouble, 
and he should probably 
 have Rich out there 
because Rich is going 
 to make sure 
that I get booted off tonight 
 and not him. 
Maybe somewhere 
 he's thinking that. 
He's smart 
 if he's thinking that. 
I like that. 
Good job, Sean. 
I can't figure out why 
he switched at the last minute, 
but all them ladies 
 are pissed off at him. 
Rich had better 
 made a haul back. 
Jeff, literally...
I have so much 
 to tell you guys. 
I am definitely getting... 
Oh, you all right? 
You all right? 
I got caught 
in the rope. 
Six out of six
 votes tonight.
Unless you came 
 back with something,
we don't care 
 if you're back.
This is my father, guys. 
What? 
Rudy, come on 
 over here. 
Sean's father.
( laughing )
SEAN: 
 I have so much 
 to tell you guys. 
Maybe we could tell him 
how dumb you were not 
to take Kelly with 
when you owed her. 
He's catching food 
for everybody. 
Pay back your debts 
before you... 
Hi.
Colleen. 
Colleen.
Sue.
Hi, Sue.
Kelly.
He's provided food
 for us 50 times. 
When Sean's dad first came, 
 to the tell you the truth, 
I almost cried because I started
 thinking about my mom 
and I miss her a lot. 
You know, Sean just gets 
 all the breaks. 
But, uh, you know, it was good.
I felt happy for him 
and he is the family kid, 
 you know. 
So, it was good for him. 
It was nice to have 
 a new face around and stuff. 
Never caught a fish? 
Never caught a fish. 
Superpole 2000. 
JIM: 
And nothing has been 
happening in the news. 
I know you're all 
 wondering what's...
There's nothing.
SUSAN: 
 What's the stock 
 market been doing?
Staying steady
 or going up? 
Oh, no. 
We had some 
bad days there. 
Did you? 
400 and something points 
on the NASDAQ. 
SUSAN: 
 What's it down to?
JIM: 
 Then it bounced up... 
 I haven't... 
the last few days,
 I don't know. 
Actually, for him to come 
 and visit the camp 
was sort of cool, 
 but he didn't know anything. 
So that war over
 in Russia 
sort of 
 mellowed out? 
What? 
They had that 
 one there... 
Chechnya. 
I don't know. 
We're like, what's going on 
 in the world? 
He didn't know none of that. 
What about the 
 college play-offs?
Dad, you know 
 anything about that? 
Oh, yeah, wait 
a minute. 
Duke? 
No. 
Indiana? 
No. 
Who the hell won? 
See, I'm not really 
a sports person. 
Oh, he's just like Sean. 
He's lovable but a doof. 
Come say good-bye 
 to my pop. 
COLLEEN: 
 Are you tired?
Pleasure 
to meet you, Jim. 
I brought something
 for all of you. 
Oh, yeah? 
Oh, geez. 
Oh, boy. 
It's like Santa Claus. 
Daddy Claus. 
What's this
 stuff? 
This is J. Peterman hat. 
Guess what this is? 
He needs clothes. 
Thank you.
He's been smelly. 
When he goes to leave 
this afternoon 
an hour and a half ago, 
he has this gray bag. 
And in it's a care package 
 for each one of us. 
Rich. 
Rich. 
JIM: 
 Somebody rich.
Kelly. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Oh, look at this! Oh! 
( shouting ) 
So, in it we each got 
 a little something 
from one of our loved ones 
 from back home. 
You got 
a toothbrush. 
Thank you. 
I don't know. 
You know what that is, 
 don't you? 
I'm getting nauseous already. 
SUSAN: 
"Even though we are apart, 
 just remember 
you are always in my heart." 
COLLEEN: 
 We all got thrown a bone, 
which was amazingly, 
 wonderfully great, 
because now I feel like I can 
do this for six more days, 
and I definitely will... 
I'm on a sugar high right now, 
more than I have been 
 in a month, 
so I feel like I can 
 do anything right now. 
Thank you so much.
My pleasure. 
Jim, thank you 
for being the bearer 
of good treasures. 
Good meeting you all. 
Loves you all. 
Pop, I love you.
My son, my son, 
my son. 
Tell my mother
 I love her. 
Oh, I will. 
 I'll tell everybody. 
Tell them I'll 
see them soon. 
Bye, Pop. 
Bye, Jim! 
Thank you! 
Plenty of food. 
I don't care. 
I'm drifting away for a while. 
Just kind of going home. 
That's phenomenal. 
God, I can't wait 
 to get out of here. 
Sean's father came back 
 with a bag 
filled with things for each 
 of us from particular people, 
and this made it from the most 
wonderful woman on the planet-- 
Valerie. 
She just printed out 
 the e-mail 
that she was having 
 with her husband 
who's another incredible man-- 
 a close friend of mine-- 
and it just takes me back 
 to my real world life 
and has my brain engaged 
 and rejuvenated 
and out of these 
16, whoever they are, people, 
and into who I am 
and just knowing what's going on
and that's it's back there 
and what I'm about to experience
 when I go back 
and, you know, 
 I can last the other 
whatever's left, 
 seven days, six days. 
Hey, guys. 
 Hi, Jeff! 
JEFF: 
This challenge is for immunity. 
Whoever wins gets the talisman 
 and cannot be voted off 
at tonight's Tribal Council. 
It's all about will, this game. 
You're going to be 
 standing on planks. 
Over a period of time, 
I'm going to remove 
 certain planks 
till we get down to one plank. 
Last person standing 
 gets the talisman 
and is safe tonight. 
This game could take 15 minutes,
it could take 15 hours. 
You will decide that. 
Only rule: 
You can't touch anybody, 
but you can taunt all you want. 
All right? 
Let's go out and do it. 
Survivors, ready? 
ALL: 
 Ready. 
Go. 
Okay. 
Got it. 
Did you think 
somebody would 
be gone yet? 
No. 
You know why 
 I'm cutting this. 
I'm pulling
 this board.
ALL: 
? ...81 bottles of beer ? 
? You take one down 
 and pass it around ? 
? 80 bottles 
 of beer on the wall ? 
? 80 bottles of beer 
 on the wall ? 
? 80 bottles of beer ? 
? You take one down, 
 you pass it around ? 
? 79 bottles of beer 
 on the wall! ? 
It's moving. 
I can't help that. 
? 79 bottles of beer 
 on the wall ? 
? 79 bottles of beer ? 
? You take one down, 
 pass it around ? 
? 78 bottles 
 of beer on the wall ? 
? 78 bottles of beer 
 on the wall ? 
? 78 bottles of beer... ? 
( yelling ) 
JEFF: 
 You just gave up? 
No, I fell. 
He couldn't 
 take it anymore. 
? 77 Bottles of beer... ? 
I slipped. 
? 65 bottles of beer ? 
? You take one down... ? 
? Pass it around ? 
? 64 bottles 
 of beer on the wall... ? 
I'm sorry to leave you 
without my music. 
See you on shore. 
RICHARD: 
So it's ironic 
that Colleen is even trying, 
because she thinks 
she's dead tonight. 
I asked her today, "Colleen,
 what makes you happy?" 
And she said, 
 "You know, Rich, 
 irony makes me happy."
So I think it's ironic 
that she's trying 
 to stay on the board
and she's not even
 in danger 
of getting voted off. 
Kelly, on the other hand, 
has no idea that she's
 leaving this evening. 
But it's still... 
RUDY: 
 I'll bet Sean gets 
 two votes from the girls. 
Yeah, Sean may get 
 votes from Colleen.
Colleen and... 
And maybe Kelly 
 just to throw a vote. 
Yeah, 'cause Kelly's 
trying to look 
as if she's not part 
of the voting bloc. 
There they go...
 ooh, ooh, ooh. 
Go! Go!
Look at her. 
 She's almost gone.
But she's 
 Miss Dancer,
so maybe she's
 got balance. 
He's cut one side.
Now he's cut the other
and they're 
 all wobbling. 
Look at the wobble.
And the play-by-play
as we look at Sue,
she's got the arms 
 up level across the side, 
but Kelly, holy Moses,
she looks like
 she's going. 
Back and forth.
 Oh, no. 
( Rudy chuckling )
RICHARD: 
 Colleen looking
 rather stable, 
although determined.
Really trying to hang on, 
thinking she's about 
 to be ejected this evening.
Sean's just as goofy
 as ever... 
and there he goes.
Sean falls off the board
 and it is down to three.
Look at them. 
Oh, Sue!
It's Kelly and Colleen.
Holy Moses.
Okay, Sue, so if it's... 
if Kelly wins immunity 
what happens? 
Sean or Colleen?
I'm thinking Sean. 
Are you thinking Sean 
 before Colleen? 
What are you 
thinking? 
I'll go with what 
 you guys say. 
What do you say? 
I say Sean. 
SUSAN: 
 Take the wisdom
 of the old man.
Take the wisdom
 of the old man.
Rudy says Sean,
so if Kelly 
 hangs in there,
Sean is out of
 here tonight! 
So, we've got 
 to watch 
'cause it's down
 to the wire. 
You aren't cold after 
being out there for so long? 
I've got to dry off 
 before I put clothes on. 
No, I'm fatter 
 than you, remember. 
There goes Kelly. 
They're both gone.
I think when 
one wobbles, 
the other wobbles. 
Oh, God, Colleen. 
This is 
 really good. 
Am I getting voted off 
 if I fall? 
Not by me. 
By the rest? 
I don't know, 
 honey. 
I'm guessing yes. 
JEFF: 
 Kelly, you got immunity. 
JEFF: 
 Colleen moved.
SEAN: 
 Good job, Wiggles.
Whoo! 
Well-earned. 
Very well-earned. 
Because this is so... 
all you guys were 
 doing out there, 
were saying, "My feet are dying,
 my feet are dying." 
What are you wearing 
to Tribal Council tonight? 
Shoes? 
Shoes. 
Okay, insoles 
 from Dr. Scholl's. 
Hopefully, they'll give you
 a little padding on that. 
SUSAN: 
 Good job, Kelly. 
KELLY: 
 Thank you. 
KELLY: 
 This stupid alliance thing-- 
I don't even care 
 about that anymore, you know? 
I say I'm not... 
 I'm not in it anymore, 
I'm voting my conscience, 
 and, you know, 
I want to be true to myself 
 and who I am 
and keep my dignity-- 
 who cares? 
COLLEEN: 
 Kelly-- she was a double agent,
 so to speak, you know, 
talking to the Pagong people, 
really trying 
 to get in with them 
and then relaying everything 
we said to her teammates. 
The, uh, the Pagong people, 
 fortunately 
picked up on that, 'cause 
 they all came to me in unison 
and they said, 
"I think Kelly's up to no good,"
and, uh, so... so it was 
very plastic, very see-through, 
and even her biggest advocate 
 on this island, Sue, 
saw right through that. 
KELLY: 
 I'm voting strategically. 
So are they, and they still 
think I'm in the stupid alliance
because if I told them 
 I didn't want to be, 
they'd vote me off, so I'm 
trying to save my own ass. 
So how bold and wonderful 
 is that? 
SUSAN: 
 Me and Kelly, I thought, 
 had a real friendship going. 
I really did. 
But, uh, when I turn around 
and see somebody starting 
to dig a knife into my backside,
it just really pisses me off. 
I don't care 
 what I say to people. 
I don't care... if I'm nice 
 to anybody at camp anymore. 
I do not give a ..., 
 and it feels so good. 
It's great, I love it. 
Welcome to Tribal Council 11. 
We're going to bring
 in our jury now. 
It consists of Greg, Jenna
and, as of last week, 
Gervase 
who was the last person 
voted off. 
Two of you will make 
 it to the final vote. 
The other four 
will join these three 
and will decide 
who gets the million dollars. 
So let's talk about 
what's gone on since 
 the last Tribal Council.
A busy, busy time-- 
a lot of it 
hovering around you, Sean. 
One decision, though, 
 you had to make 
was, right as we left, 
heading out to the yacht, 
I said, "you know what? 
 Why don't you invite somebody 
for breakfast." 
 Correct. 
Puts you in 
 a tough spot. 
 Very tough spot. 
You had to pick somebody. 
Absolutely. 
So what made you change 
 your mind at the last minute? 
Rich provides food. 
KELLY: 
Yeah, but let's not forget 
the fact that you said, 
"Kelly, all right, 
 I'm going to take you, 
"but you can give it to Rich, 
so I don't know, 
it's in your hands." 
I'll tell you why, 
 and she knows this.
Rich also gave us 
tons of food. 
He goes out every day 
fishing for four hours, 
comes back with something 
 in his basket 
nine out of ten times, 
 which is really great 
for the tribe. 
 But you didn't say that. 
This is what 
 I'm thinking, so...
A day later. 
 No. 
What do you mean, 
 a day later? 
 Not at all. 
He was in my thoughts 
 when I mentioned breakfast. 
He really wanted 
 to go on that ship 
during the contest--
 I factored all 
 that into it 
and I said, "Kelly,
 who wants to come?"
And I yelled from the ship 
and I just made 
 an instant decision. 
If it was the wrong one 
and it gets me a vote 
 from Kelly... 
I'm sorry, Kelly. 
It's not about the food, 
Sean-- it's the fact 
that the whole day before, 
you were saying, 
"Oh, I'm going 
to take you, and..." 
I mean, you don't 
owe me anything. 
It's not about that. 
So... 
It's just the fact 
that you were saying... 
I felt obliged,
 that's all. 
JEFF: 
 Okay...
Richard. 
Yeah? 
Two Tribal Councils ago,
 you got three votes. 
Yeah. 
 The only thing 
that saved you 
 was the now-infamous 
"alphabet system,"
which cast a 
 vote for Jenna
was the swing vote. 
I mean, other people 
voted for Jenna, 
but it was 
that swing vote 
that was based 
 on the alphabet
 that saved you.
It looked that way, yeah. 
It seems like at this point, 
if I'm just looking at it 
 on paper, 
you would be in 
 a very precarious 
 situation tonight.
I could be going home tonight. 
Absolutely. 
JEFF: 
 How about you,
 Colleen? 
Last Tribal Council,
 you said, 
"I'm either going tonight, Jeff,
or I'm going 
the next Tribal Council." 
I mean, I'm feeling... 
 I'm feeling, uh... 
I'm feeling 
 like I'm going, yeah. 
I mean, I'm the last... 
I'm the last of 
 my kind... here.
I'm the last Pagong.
So, uh, yeah. 
JEFF: 
What's your gut on 
how nasty it's going to get? 
Mm... what's my gut 
on how nasty it's going to get? 
It's going to get pretty nasty. 
There's a lot of, uh... 
 a lot of stuff going on. 
Okay, it's time to vote. 
Rich. 
Whoa. 
Um... 
why are you going tonight? 
Because you screwed up. 
It wasn't your turn. 
You were supposed to stay, 
so you're actually 
 being sacrificed 
even though 
 you were supposed to stay. 
But... good night. 
I can't vote for myself, 
so I've got to vote for Sean, 
because, uh... same reason 
 as last week, really. 
He knows. He knows. 
24-7 is all I have to say. 
I'm voting for Colleen. 
Even though she calls me a putz 
 all the time, 
I know we're good friends, 
 and I like her a lot. 
She's a cool girl. 
So, I'm voting... 
 changing her name 
to "Cooleen," and, uh, 
 she's a really cool girl. 
I enjoyed her company, 
and I'll probably see her 
 next vote... 
in the jury. 
JEFF: 
 Across from you now 
are ten torches 
representing the first 
 ten people voted off. 
Tonight we will add 
 one more staff to that group. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once your votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
to leave the island immediately.
They will return, however, 
to the next Tribal Council 
as the fourth member 
 of our final jury. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote... 
Sean. 
Colleen. 
Colleen. 
Sean. 
Two votes for Colleen; 
 two votes for Sean. 
Three votes Colleen. 
Colleen, you need to
 bring me your torch.
( quietly ): 
 Be nice to each other, okay? 
I swear to God, 
 I'm watching you. 
Bye. Okay. 
Play fair, okay? 
Colleen, the tribe
 has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go.
Okay. No regrets. 
Okay. 
 Okay, bye. 
Good-bye. 
Bye, Colleen. 
Well, I heard 
 Colleen's last words: 
"Play fair; be nice." 
She's a wonderful person. 
You guys can grab 
 your torches 
and head back to camp.
Next week on Survivor: 
SEAN: 
 This is the most conniving 
bunch of people 
 I have ever met in my life. 
There's not an honest one 
 in the bunch. 
Things are falling apart here 
at Rattana Beach. 
And you told him you 
 weren't aligned with us.
'Cause Colleen 
 told me that. 
 That's bull....
I don't give a ... 
 because I trust her 
 more than I trust you.
I had a lot of fun, 
and the past week 
was actually 
the hardest part 
 of the whole thing. 
I'm excited now 
 for the next step. 
I want to sit 
 in the jury box. 
If I came 
 into this game 
on Tagi's team, 
 I think I could've won. 
I'm just going 
 to say it, you know. 
No harm in 
saying it now 
after I've been 
kicked off 
and I didn't win, 
but really, 
I think I could've won.
