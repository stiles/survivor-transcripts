 --- 

         16 Americans forced 
 to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Marooned for 39 days, 
 they must work together 
to build shelter, find food 
 and survive the island, 
but ultimately, 
 it is everyone for themselves. 
Every third night, they will 
 hike deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, 
 only one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 








Conflict within the tribes 
 continued to emerge. 
You can only 
 take so much preaching. 
Dirk's about driving me 
 wild with that. 
When Christ came, He opened 
the door to every human being. 
We've all sort of 
 come to the conclusion 
that Rudy really needs 
 to get out 
of here-- he just criticizes 
 whatever we're doing. 
Come into the kitchen, "Morning,
Rudy, how are you doing?" 
"You're wasting 
 your time out there." 
JEFF: 
 And hunger set in. 
 The oomph is a little gone. 
I think that not eating 
 is a factor. 
( laughs ): 
 We want food. 
JEFF: 
 Tagi Tribe gained advantage 
 by winning a reward challenge. 
I wanted that mask 
 and snorkel from day one 








to go get fish. 
We got fish. 
No way. No way! 
( shrieking ) 
Watch the spear. 
JEFF: 
 Pagong was forced 
 to look elsewhere for food. 
JENNA: 
 I'm so ready to eat rat. 
I want to gut 'em, bone 'em... 
JOEL: 
Surf 'n' turf. Minnows and rat. 
GREG: 
 Rats aren't bad. 
Rats are rats. 
Questions of edibility only have
 to do with your perceptions. 
RAMONA: 
Please pass the rat. 
JEFF: 
 But Pagong rebounded by 
 winning the immunity challenge,
and Tagi Tribe was sent back 
 to Tribal Council in the middle
of a tropical storm. 
STACEY: 
 I thought Rudy would be 
the next one off, 
 but it could be me. 
RUDY: 
 I'm going to vote Stacey out, 
 'cause I don't like her 
and I never will. 
JEFF: 
 Stacey. That's four 
 votes, Stacey. 
It's time for you to go.
13 are left. 
Who will be voted off 
 this week, 
and who will continue 
 to survive? 
( thunder rumbling ) 
I'm not a happy camper. 
GERVASE: 
 It's cold, man. 
It got cold and rained a lot, 
and everybody got, I mean... 
everybody was just wet. 
RAMONA: 
 It was long, wet and cold. 
It was the worst night 
I've ever slept. 
GREG: 
 And worse trouble 
was the bugs-- 
 the bugs love it. 
Once that rain comes, 
 it's sand flea heaven. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I have spent six years 
at the Air Force 
 survival school. 
You know, we learned how 
 to make fires and shelters. 
Come on... 
When we got here, 
we argued over 
 where the shelter should be, 
and everything I've always 
 been taught, you know, 
you put it up off the beach, 
you get canopy cover, 
which is your first layer 
 of protection, 
but we made this huge shelter, 
 which was not comfortable 
and it's not practical. 
It's a rain forest, 
so it was going to pour 
 one of these times, 
and it poured, 
 and we got soaking wet, 
and I just thought, 
 "This is ridiculous," you know.
And also, 
 the gear is everywhere. 
Our rice bucket's down there; 
 the shovel's down there; 
we don't know, you know, where 
the parangs are in the morning, 
and... it's got to stop. 
What's the reason 
 for that, though? 
It's not up-tide-- look. 
The shovel is over there
 'cause we just dug... 
I know, but you're done digging,
 so the shovel... 
We don't know if
 it's done yet. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I think I am a little 
 frustrated with Joel today 
because Joel wants 
 to take over, 
and that's fine, 
 but Joel doesn't know about... 
where we're going to be 
 the most comfortable, 
and so, you know, 
 after last night, I thought, 
"Well, I just can't let 
 this go on anymore." 
You want to vote me off, fine, 
 but we got to organize this. 
I don't want to sleep 
 in that anymore, okay? 
You can sleep on the 
 beach if you want to. 
I don't want to sleep 
on the beach anymore. 
I don't want to be antisocial, 
 but I'm going in the woods. 
Why don't we just go? 
 Why don't we just start?
We get to move--
 it's so exciting
when you get to move
 to a new place. 
Oh, man, it's hot. 
GRETCHEN: 
 If this were, right now, 
 each man for himself, 
Greg would be the victor. 
He's relaxed. 
He's not fighting this. 
It's not like a battle for him. 
Greg's a character, man. 
Hold on one second. Yeah? 
Greg talks into a coconut 
and thinks it's a phone. 
This guy wants 
 to do an interview 
for four or five minutes. 
GREG: 
 The naturephone is really a way
that I kind of keep in touch 
 with the greater, um... 
the greater spirit out here. 
All right, listen, well, 
 uh, yeah, just hold my calls 
if, uh, anybody's in this... 
You get reception everywhere. 
You're always incommunicado 
with everything 
 and anyone, and, uh... 
you know, it's light, 
 it's quick, it's easy, 
and it's relatively inexpensive.
Do you have a fitting 
 for bamboo? 
Okay. 
Yeah, yeah, 
as quickly as possible. 
GRETCHEN: 
 Greg knows what he's doing-- 
 he kind of 
manipulates the group, 
 and I think 
a lot of people don't even 
 realize it's going on. 
I think most of the people don't
 even realize it's going on, 
but in his own way, 
 Greg's the leader. 
Okay. Yeah, yeah. 
Two min... Okay, bye. 
Sorry about that. 
Hit Greg in the head. 
SEAN: 
 Sue, she just always keeps 
 working, working, working. 
You know, 
 it just drives everybody crazy.
I mean, the guys were talking 
 about that today. 
I wish she would slow down 
for a little bit and just relax.
SUSAN: 
 We're getting by 
 on coconut and rice. 
You know, 
 whatever we can gather, 
and we're still not done 
 looking for tapioca or nuts. 
Tapioca. 
Tapioca's supposed 
 to have red lines. 
Got to find the tapioca. 
SEAN: 
 I had this vision, 
and, uh, I thought I'd 
 build myself a bowling alley 
right about here. 
That's what I'm doing here, 
 slaving away. 
( Susan grunts with effort ) 
This little... 
Aw, this is all woody. 
What I think I might do is, 
I might take 
 some of those coconuts 
over there-- 
 that are lined up like that-- 
I might take that bamboo 
 over there 
and make, like, a little shelf 
where you can have the extra 
 balls hanging out up there? 
No, that's a stalk. 
Oh, is that... 
that's those big nuts. 
Sean's telling me looking 
 for nuts is a waste of time. 
But at least you know 
 you can find a nut. 
Sean sits there for five hours 
 and builds his bowling alley. 
He could've been 
 all getting nuts or looking 
for tapioca during the day. 
I'm tired of feeding people 
 that don't do anything. 
If we lose tomorrow, 
 I'm voting Sean off. 
My parents would be so proud. 
Throughout their time 
 on the island, 
the tribes will compete 
in a series of challenges. 
They'll receive messages 
notifying them of these 
competitions at tree mail. 
Today's mail 
 informs both tribes 
about their next 
 reward challenge 
called "Distress Signal." 
Hey, you guys! 
JEFF: 
 They'll build an S.O.S. 
 on their respective beaches. 
A plane flying overhead 
will determine whose signal 
 is the most creative 
and parachute in 
 a crate full of supplies. 
Both tribes 
 have been instructed 
to send a representative 
to see the creature comforts 
 they'll be competing for. 
We've got a nice luxury 
going on-- whoa! 
JEFF: 
 Things like hammocks, 
 towels and pillows. 
Oh, my God! 
JEFF: 
 But Jenna and Dirk 
 have each requested 
one additional item 
 be placed into the crate. 
We want a spice rack, 
including salt, pepper, 
garlic, soy sauce... 
Then you would have 
a full-out competition 
for that spice rack. 
What would make it 
 worthwhile for you? 
We need a 
 flay knife. 
JEFF: 
Here's the deal-- two clues 
for tomorrow's challenge. 
Do me a favor, though. 
Don't open them 
till you get back to camp. 
I'll do what I can 
about the reward. 
Nice talking to you. 
Right on. 
Nice talking 
to you guys. 
 All right! 
Thanks for the nap. 
All right. 
A spice rack 
is the best. 
Good for you. 
I wouldn't have 
 thought of that one.
COLLEEN: 
What happened? 
What did we get? 
We got this. 
COLLEEN: 
What is it? 
Okay, okay, okay. 
"A store you all know 
 has decided to show 
"some support 
 to the survivors here. 
"The noise you hear humming 
is a plane that is coming 
"to drop a crate 
 filled with gear. 
"Soft pillows of down, 
 hammocks off-ground, 
"a bar of soap 
 to wash up some,
"a crisp white towel, 
 so you won't feel so... 
Towel! 
( laughing ) 
"...some toilet paper 
 to wipe off your bum. 
"The gift is only won 
as you work under the sun. 
Remember, this challenge 
 matches wit." 
Oh, you guys, 
 we so have this. 
Can I tell you something else, 
 what the prize is? 
They added, 
 because I finagled... 
A spice rack. 
JENNA: 
 Oh, yeah, baby. 
( cheering ) 
 Tomorrow morning, 
a plane flies over 
 two hours after the sunrise. 
And it has to be on our beach-- 
anything-- a symbol, a word, 
 you could spell out anything. 
"Naked." 
I know what 
 goes best. 
Something really good. 
One quick bonfire. 
No, hell, no. 
We got to do something 
bigger and better! 
They do one big bonfire, 
one big bonfire... 
Yawn. 
You do the 
 fire but... 
We got to sell it! 
This is like advertising; 
we're selling this spot. 
Simple but... impact. 
GREG: 
 What's creative, though, 
and exciting to 
 see from up high? 
Sex, naked people... 
We're trapped on 
a desert island, you know? 
We're horny. 
( laughing ) 
There's also going to be 
 a spice rack in there 
and one phat, filthy, 
stainless steel flay knife. 
Yeah, something we need.
All right? So, we need, 
we've got one chance. 
We've got 
to do this right. 
Ideas? 
RUDY: 
 Tomorrow, right? 
 It's gonna be daylight.
We'll make a 
 lot of smoke. 
Smoke, a lot
 of wet wood.
KELLY: 
We should bring it 
over by the fire. 
Have the fire 
blazing to all hell. 
It's not about size; 
it's not about fire. 
Well, fire is going to help. 
SEAN: 
 There's a little bit 
 of conflict of ideas 
between everybody right now, 
 uh, regarding our next event. 
SUSAN: 
Are you against that? 
Nobody's against it, 
 but we want to figure... 
SUSAN: 
Yeah, but two hours... 
RICHARD: 
 There was conflict there 
 between Dirk and Sue 
when she was trying to get going
and Dirk was saying, "No," 
and she made fun of his swagger.
Let's have a clear plan, 
 then let's go to work, 
you know what I'm saying? 
Okay. 
 Thank you, Sue. 
The ideas I didn't like 
 were just some of the things 
that maybe were a little bit 
 tasteless or... 
you know, and don't have 
 much class, you know? 
I believe that class kind of 
shows itself, and things like...
Condoms. 
If we had 
enough condoms 
and they were 
different-colored, 
that would be so funny. 
I don't know if that 
has much class, you know. 
You guys could put the little 
orange thingies on your wieners.
That's not very creative. 
That's just looking 
in a bathroom stall wall. 
RICHARD: 
We can also use 
those white 
 Styrofoam floats
and create a big 
 arrow in the water 
that's, you know, 
 pointed right 
 toward the beach. 
That's an idea; 
that's an idea. 
I don't think 
 we can do it together 
without the things floating 
 all discombobulated. 
Yay, Mr. Positive. 
 All right. 
RICHARD: 
 An idea comes up and you 
 can see on people's faces 
when Sean is negative about it, 
and then they'll just harp on it
 and make it... 
want it even more. 
SEAN: 
 I just think
 that we need
to do something simple 
 but extravagant. 
Like one thing 
 that we all work on. 
You know, similar to, like... 
 like the Rose Bowl. 
SEAN: 
 I just wish people would, 
 you know, see things my way, 
in terms of, 
 I think that what they want 
is something really spectacular,
and I think that we could work 
 through the night and build 
something really spectacular 
that would ensure us 
 getting that crate. 
What's happening in my head is,
 "Here's the conflict. 
"Here comes 
 the dynamics that suck. 
"Here come the people that 
 just shout and don't listen. 
Here comes the negativity, 
and here comes the crap." 
You talk about 
 doing a float 
or something that... 
 Not a float, 
 a project. 
I know, a project. 
 It could be 
 a big "X." 
You know, we build 
 a tremendous "X" 
in the sand and 
 stand it up. 
Did you think I was done 
with my sentence? 
Well, I know what the resolution
 to the conflict 
that exists right now 
 would be at home, 
but I'm actually planning 
 something different from that 
that might benefit me, 
and it's a little sneaky. 
( chuckling ) 
I think 
 I'm going to handle this 
by beginning 
 to develop alliances 
with some folks 
to ensure that I move 
 into the next round. 
That means we need 
 to clean up that beach. 
JENNA: 
 I don't think Ramona's 
 pulling her weight. 
I think that she really thought
 she could handle this, 
and now she's finding 
that I don't think she... 
she can as much as she thought. 
Ugh. 
Yesterday was bad, bad night. 
The only thing 
Ramona can be is herself. 
I'm a mama's girl. 
Well, I'm mama's 
 only child, so... 
She has great gifts to offer. 
Maybe she will be able to. 
Maybe she won't. 
But I can't do any more 
 than I can do, 
and I'm not going to try 
 and bust my ass 
and try and prove something. 
Every chance she got, 
 she was just making it worse. 
And I'll expend 
 extra energy. 
I'll give this 
 one to him. 
I tried to pull her to the side 
 and just 
point certain things out to her 
and try to get her 
to correct that situation. 
Everybody's in cliques, 
 and I'm, like, here. 
It's all about everybody 
 being nice. 
You don't want to be
 out there kissing 
 everybody's ass, 
you know what I mean? 
Don't start withdrawing 
 in yourself now, 
you know, like... going solo. 
DIRK: 
 I really like our slogan-- 
 I think it's going 
to grab someone's attention. 
We're giving it our best shot. 
We want to win. 
GERVASE: 
 Work-wise, 
 Ramona seemed today 
to be, "Oh, I'll help here, 
 I'll help here. 
I'll do this, I'll do that." 
RAMONA: 
 I feel more like a part 
 of the group, 
and I don't know if that's 
because I'm feeling better 
and therefore 
 I'm working more and harder, 
or if it's because, like, 
 I've started to assert myself. 
I don't know, 
 I guess it's a combination. 
GERVASE: 
 Looking forward to getting 
 a spice rack 
to flavor up the rice. 
And towels. I'm the only one 
who wants towels. 
And pillows. 
 I like the pillows. 
Where do you 
want to cross? 
Um, right here. 
Here. 
Yeah... yeah, 
we're all on island time. 
Who you talking to?! 
The pilot, 
 the pilot of the plane. 
Can you hear me?! 
Yeah. I don't want to tell you 
 exactly what it looks like. 
It's, uh... 
 just put it this way: 
we're all very excited 
 to be here. 
JEFF: 
It's 10:11 on the island, 
and aside from the ever-present 
 desire for more food, 
both tribes have begun to 
reprioritize those core items-- 
the things that would make life 
 a bit easier. 
We're currently flying 
 above the island. 
On board, one crate filled with,
 among other things, 
a few hammocks, several pillows,
 one spice rack and one knife. 
The tribe whose distress signal 
 is most clearly visible 
from this plane gets it all. 
KELLY: 
 Hey! Hey! Come on! 
( imitating Tattoo 
 from Fantasy Island ): 
 "De plane! De plane!" 
Here we come approaching Tagi. 
( all chanting ): 
 Spice... rack... 
up... 
PROBST: 
 That's very good. 
"Tagi is groggy!" 
We're gong to swing over now 
and take a look at Pagong. 
Here it comes! 
Whoo! 
Save us! 
Save us!
GERVASE: 
 Come on! 
Save us! 
We're banking towards Pagong 
 right now. 
We're about as close to them 
 as you can get. 
They have a smiley face. 
We're going to make 
 one more pass. 
I'm going to confer 
 with the captain 
and also the drop master 
and see what their thoughts are.
Please! Please! 
They're not going 
to drop it. 
MAN: 
 Up, two, three, 
 down, two three.. 
Right here, please. 
PROBST: 
 I've conferred with the pilot 
and the drop master, 
guys that do this for a living. 
We're all three in agreement: 
Pagong has a great 
 distress signal, 
but the addition of human bodies
colorfully dressed, moving, 
makes Tagi's distress signal 
 more clear from the air. 
Therefore, 
Tagi is getting 
 the care package. 
There it is. 
( cheering ) 
That drop boy can go. 
It's hard being 
 this good. 
It's hard being 
 this stinky. 
( tauntingly ): 
? We got your 
spice rack! ? 
? We got your spice rack! ? 
How about a big "aw" 
 for the other team? 
Aw! 
Let's go get it. 
Whoo! 
GRETCHEN: 
 All that waiting, 
all that work 
for nothing. 
Man, I wanted garlic. 
Yo, look what we found. 
There we go. Let's see. 
Ah! We like 
 it there. 
Ooh! 
Look at the knife! 
Yeah! 
That's something 
to fish. 
Now we're eating. 
Spices. 
Salt. 
This looks 
like oregano. 
What do we got in there? 
Curry. 
I think this is garlic. 
RICHARD: 
 That's where
you'll always find it-- 
 around my thigh. 
You think they're bummed
 about their spices? 
I'll take a victory 
 over Jenna right now. 
Groggy no more. 
That's right, man. 
I didn't like 
the final decision 
 for the S.O.S. Game. 
I thought it was quite silly-- 
 a smiley face? 
Give me a break. 
I didn't expect us 
 to win anyway. 
It's a little disappointing, 
but it's okay. 
So it's another day of rice. 
I'm down. 
I hate to lose. 
It sucks. 
But tomorrow's the one 
 that counts, so... 
trying to look up. 
KELLY: 
 The whole idea of an alliance 
is to make sure we're all... 
 voting the same way. 
So are we going 
 to stick to it? 
I'm going 
to stick to it. 
RICHARD: 
 So the, um... 
alliances have begun, 
and I didn't even have 
 to do much about it. 
I don't want to 
 vote anyone off... 
I agree with Rich, I think, 
about the Sean thing. 
Yeah. 
KELLY: 
 Sue and I had discussed 
 on our own about 
getting Richard in the same vote
and us three having 
 the same vote. 
So no matter what, 
even if we never talk again, 
the next vote is...? 
KELLY: 
 Because the more people you 
 know that are going to vote 
for somebody else, 
you might as well go with that. 
You might as well, you know, 
 keep yourself safe, 
and, you know, 
 keep it in the majority. 
We have alliances that are 
 happening within the group, 
and you're going to have that, 
just because, you know, 
 everybody's... 
hey, there's money involved. 
We really could control our fate
if we stick together. 
I think what's going 
 to happen in the end, 
there'll be alliances. 
There could be. 
 Oh, yeah! 
KELLY: 
 We really like Rudy. 
Rudy's kind of crabby, 
 but he's a lot better 
to get along with, you know, 
 than the two boys. 
At least he's honest. 
You know, he'll tell you, 
 you know, 
"Up yours," in a second. 
Sue! 
What, if anything, 
 should be said to Rudy? 
RUDY: 
 Somebody said that 
if you want to sort of gang up 
 against somebody, 
you ought to talk about it 
to get rid of them, but, uh, 
 I don't agree with that, 
so I'm not doing it. 
I don't know 
 about the rest of them. 
RICHARD: 
 It's hard to kind 
 of trust people 
completely and thoroughly, 
but I think 
until the next segment, 
the three of us 
can work together 
 really well. 
I trust you
 completely.
 Yeah. 
RICHARD: 
 I think we can trust 
 the three of our votes, 
'cause if one of us blows up, 
 trustworthiness-wise, 
then this whole thing's 
 out the window 
and it's... it's a free-for-all.
The three of us 
 against the world. 
( laughing )
This is going to be 
so good. 
You want a small spoon 
 or a big spoon? 
I'll take a small one 
 'cause I got a big mouth. 
Jenna-- she's like 
 this Energizer bunny 
that, like, keeps going 
 and going 
and going. 
( trilling ) 
Pagong! 
RAMONA: 
 Like, I haven't had 
 a white friend 
since, like, 
 junior high school, 
and I really can see her 
 being, like, 
my first white friend 
 in a long time. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I think Ramona's change 
 has to do with 
she's feeling more comfortable, 
 she's feeling better. 
She feels like 
 she's more part of the group, 
which I don't think she felt 
 in the very beginning. 
I'll help you with that 
in a second. 
I'm almost done with this. 
I think we've definitely seen 
 Ramona's redemption this week. 
I'll come and help in a second! 
GERVASE: 
 Looks like she's turned 
 things around. 
That's in my eyes, 
 she's redeemed herself. 
Other people's eyes, it could be
totally different. 
I think Ramona has changed 
her attitude... 
Well, no. Changed 
 her work ethic a lot. 
But I don't think her attitude 
 has changed much. 
She is working more, 
 she's trying, 
but I think maybe it is 
a little too little too late. 
RAMONA: 
 This is what I'm like 
every day when I'm feeling 
like at a hundred percent. 
You want to play rough, huh? 
I'm feeling... good about 
being a part of the group. 
( grunts ) 
( grunts ) 
Hopefully, everyone sees, like,
"Wow. This is Ramona," you know?
"This is what, like, 
 a hundred percent Ramona 
can offer to the team." 
GREG: 
 The immunity challenge 
 will be huge today 
whether the other team loses and
has to vote out another person, 
then they're two people short 
of what we have, 
or if we have 
 to vote somebody out, 
Uh, things should 
 get interesting. 
I don't want to make 
 that trek tonight. 
We got to win. 
GREG: 
 Another 
 secret message? 
GRETCHEN: 
"The key to this challenge 
is to conquer by dividing. 
"On each doing the best, 
"your success will be riding. 
"You'll need someone to swim, 
another to balance, 
"a runner, a rower, 
and a digger with talents. 
"It's a big choice 
to decide who gets where. 
"Make the right moves, 
"and immunity you'll share. 
"Spend some time thinking, 
make sure there's no doubt, 
"make the wrong call, 
and it could be you voted out." 
JOEL: 
 What do you 
 think, Greg?
What? 
Plan A, we plan everything out, 
and then plan B, we throw 
everything out the window 
when we get there 
 and completely panic 
and do whatever we think 
 we should. 
GERVASE: 
 We'll win. 
 Both. 
It might be close, but we'll 
 definitely win today. 
Without a doubt. 
We got to win 
 this immunity challenge. 
We got to stomp them so bad. 
We're excited for the challenge,
 we feel confident, 
and we feel ready. 
JOEL: 
 Yeah, this is a big one, 
and this is huge. 
Um, you know, yeah, 
we don't want to lose this one. 
We're here to compete, 
and we're here 
to win these competitions, 
and we're here to do them 
 as a team. 
I wouldn't say 
 we're-we're cocky. 
I just think that we're, 
 uh, we're the best. 
Welcome, guys. 
 Hey. 
I'll take the idol-- 
 back up for grabs today. 
Welcome to Asmara Beach. 
It's a relay today, 
 so the sum 
of all 
of your individual efforts 
will determine 
 who wins and who loses. 
If one person 
 completely falls down 
their team could crumble-- 
 they may end up paying 
for those actions tonight 
 at the Tribal Council. 
Colleen, come on up. 
 Who's your... 
Sean. Okay, 
 you guys come up here, 
and I'll explain this 
 using this map. 
There are five legs 
 in the relay. 
The first leg is the swim. 
You'll start here 
and head for these buoys. 
Directly underneath is 
 a bottle, which contains a map.
Grab the bottle 
and pass it 
 to one of your tribe members. 
For the second leg, 
you'll run the bottle 
 across this floating bridge 
into an awaiting boat. 
The third leg is the paddle, 
 where you'll head for shore 
and hand the bottle off. 
Inside of it is a map 
showing the destinations 
 for the remaining two events. 
The fourth leg is 
a sprint into the jungle. 
Using the map, the runner 
will find a rope ladder. 
Climb up it, 
 and you'll grab a key. 
For the fifth and final leg, 
two members of your tribe will 
locate the buried treasure chest
and dig it up. 
The first team to get your chest
 back on your crate 
with the key in the lock 
wins immunity. 
ALL: 
 Tagi! 
ALL: 
 Pagong! 
All right, guys, 
thermometer's topping 
 100 degrees. 
This is for immunity. 
Whoo! 
Survivors ready?

Sean! 
Swim, baby, swim! 
Come on, Colleen.

You're doing good, Colleen!

Amazon women! 
Oh, my God! 
GERVASE:

RAMONA:

and dig around it a little bit. 
It's not going 
 to budge. 
MAN:

Don't quit! 
Come on, Richard, 
 we got our runner! 
Come on, Richie!
Get it in there! 
 Come on! 
Come on, you guys,

( yelping ) 
RAMONA:

( yelling ) 
Come on! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
Put the key in it! 
Come on, Rich! 
( yelling ) 
We did our best.
We did our best.
That's not good enough. 
The idol. 
SUSAN: 
Oh, yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Tagi, nice job. 
Nice job. 
WOMAN: 
Good job, you guys. 
Pagong, I'll see you tonight-- 
 Tribal Council. 
GERVASE: 
 The most difficult thing 
 of this whole thing for me 
is to vote somebody off. 
I think we're dreading that. 
JENNA: 
 Going to this island 
 council meeting tonight 
it's really tough. 
The thought of eliminating 
 any of these people 
that we're placing 
all of our confidence in, 
it's getting worse. 
I can't imagine 
 and I can't fathom 
voting off somebody 
 from this team tonight. 
I'm going, not knowing 
 what's going to happen, 
and I'm nervous. 
I wish I started slower. 
And then I wish 
it wasn't so far. 
I'm nervous about votes 
 being against me tonight 
because of... 
I'm not a champion 
 in the competition. 
Speed-wise, 
 we got right down there. 
We got right down 
 to the treasure chest, 
and it just kept collapsing in, 
and it was so devastating. 
All day I had this feeling 
 that my leg would be the one 
that would lose it for us, 
 and it did. 
It does make me feel vulnerable,
um, for the vote tonight. 
GERVASE: 
 If somebody had to go right now
 in our tribe, 
I would vote for Jenna, 
because she's more annoying 
 than Colleen. 
I could deal with Jenna 
 not being here, 
then just keep Colleen around 
 a little longer. 
We're all friends, 
and then you boot someone. 
It's like the board game Sorry. 
You pick the card and you got 
 to take your thing and smash 
the other guy out of the way. 
Knock 'em out, that's that, 
 you move on. 
Sor-r-r-r-ry! 
This is Tribal Council, 
where each week, one member 
 will be voted off the island. 
The last time Pagong went 
 to Tribal Council, 
Ramona got three votes. 
Is she still at risk? 
Will Gervase's weak performances
in the last several challenges 
 cost him? 
Or will it be someone 
 nobody expects? 
( gong tolls ) 
Go ahead and take a seat. 
So here we are again... 
with the unpleasant task, 
yet you actually have 
 a very tough mandate. 
You have to vote one
of your tribe members 
 off the island tonight. 
And I think what 
 makes it equally hard 
is that in doing so, 
 you're sort of forced 
to hold a mirror up 
 to yourselves. 
Ramona, what criteria 
 do you use 
in determining who you're going 
 to vote off the island? 
Everything is so dynamic. 
I mean, I could have been 
thinking one person 
 when we left camp 
and have 
a totally different person 
in my mind now, so... 
I mean, nobody, like, 
 totally sucks, so... 
it's like, mmm, 
 at this point, 
I mean, we all like each other, 
 so it's not like... 
I mean, it would 
 almost even be easier 
if we didn't like each other 
 and I was like, "I hate you! 
You're outta here!" 
But we like each other 
so it's like, 
 I don't know. 
I mean, it's how you feel 
 at that time 
when you go up to write 
 their name, it's like... 
"Mmm... all right." 
And you want to keep 
 the team strong, so... 
that's probably the main thing. 
Anybody feel
confident enough 
 that they want to own up 
to feeling invincible 
 in tonight's vote, 
certain that 
 when this is over, 
 they will be here? 
( laughs ) 
You go, G. 
I'll be around. 
I'm looking to hang 
 till the final four. 
Well, it's interesting 
 that you say that, 
because for the last
 three challenges, 
you were somewhat 
 responsible for 
 your tribe's loss. 
Bugging out with those 
 bugs, in from the deep, 
swimming-- for somebody 
who's still really learning 
 how to swim, 
you took that on heartily-- 
and then today, 
 I think it says 
 a lot about you 
that you still feel 
 that confident 
that you aren't 
 going anywhere. 
Nah. I feel quite comfortable 
 in my position on this island. 
Okay. Anybody want to own up 
to feeling 
 vulnerable tonight? 
( laughter ) 
I think I may have just played 
myself out on the last question,
so I'm feeling quite vulnerable 
 right now, 
but, I mean, 
 I'll be back tomorrow. 
( laughter ) 
Jenna, you're going 
to walk over there, you're going
 to pick up that pen, 
you're going to write down 
 a name. 
Is it going to feel good, 
or is it going 
 to feel bad? 
I feel guilty. 
I feel bad. 
Why do you feel guilty? 
Well, I mean, I'm going to have 
 to put somebody's name down 
that I really respect 
 and have come to really like. 
It's like taking
 a piece of our 
 family away. 
You may say that it 
 may strengthen the 
 team because you take 
the weakest link, 
but I don't think so, 
because we're so strong 
right now. 
You take one of us away-- 
I don't care who it is-- 
and you've got a weaker tribe. 
All right. It's time to vote. 
Gervase.
My vote is for Colleen. 
We don't know what lies ahead 
 right now, but we're hurting. 
So I think we need to stay 
 as strong as possible. 
I mean, I love the girl 
 to death, but... 
somebody's got to go, 
 so it's got to be for Colleen. 
Self-fulfilling prophecy. 
It seems time to go. 
No comment. 
Because even though she tried 
 to redeem herself, 
a little too little, too late. 
Before I read the votes, 
I just want to remind you 
 that, once they're tallied, 
the decision is final, 
 and the person 
will need to leave 
 the island immediately. 
You'll go down this bridge, 
 follow the path, 
and about 200 feet down 
 is a confessional. 
You can speak as long as you 
like to say all your good-byes. 
Sound good? 
All right. 
Read the votes. 
First vote. 
"Ramona." 
"Jenna." 
"Colleen." 
"Colleen." 
"Ramona." 
Two votes for Ramona, 
 two votes for Colleen. 
"Mona." 
Last vote. 
"Ramona." 
Good luck, Ramona. 
Need for you to grab
 your torch, Ramona. 
The tribe has spoken. 
Time for you to go. 
Bye, Ramona. 
JEFF: 
 Survived another one. 
I'll see you guys tomorrow. 
Good night. 
( tribal chanting ) 
JEFF: 
 Next week on Survivor: 
SUSAN: 
 You guys wasted 
three days fishing 
 during the day. 
I don't think 
 it was a waste. 
 Did you catch anything? 
No, ma'am. 
 It was a waste of time, then. 
It's expected to get 
 on each other's nerves. 
Everyone's on my nerves, too, 
but I just don't really 
 act on it. 
COLLEEN: 
 When we go off, 
it's all about sex. 
It's really passionate affair 
 right now. 
I think the first two days 
 that I was sick 
just really, really hurt me, 
 'cause those first two days 
were crucial in forming 
 relationships and stuff, 
and I really didn't get 
 a chance to do that 
because I was so sick... 
And I guess I'm signing off, 
 and I'm, uh... out of here. 
Peace.
