         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans forced 
 to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Marooned for 39 days, 
 they must work together 
to build shelter, find food 
 and survive the island, 
but, ultimately, 
 it is everyone for themselves. 
Every third night, they will 
 hike deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council, 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, 
 only one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 








Tensions at Tagi Tribe 
 were on the rise. 
SUSAN: 
 You guys wasted three days 
fishing during the day. 
It wasn't a waste. 
Did you catch anything? 
No, ma'am. 
It was a waste of time, then. 
It's expected 
 to get on each other's nerves. 
JEFF: 
 While at Pagong, 
 the mood was downcast. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I think the camp looks trashy. 
Something has to happen 
 to make 
everybody decide to pitch in. 
JEFF: 
 But at the reward challenge, 
Pagong rebounded by winning 
 a special food prize. 








Chicken! 
Chicken! 
 Are you kidding me? 
( screaming ) 
It's so awesome 
 we got chickens. 
JEFF: 
 And a romance 
 began to bloom. 
Colleen has joined me 
 in the forest to sleep. 
JENNA: 
 I noticed they seemed to be 
spending their nights 
 out under the stars. 
I think it's a little romance 
 going on. 
It's all about sex. 
JEFF: 
 Back at Tagi, 
 Dirk was running on empty. 
You're looking like hell. 
DIRK: 
 I've lost a lot of muscle mass,
a lot of strength. 
JEFF: 
 And his tribe 
 thought they had 
the immunity challenge 
 wrapped up. 
We need one rower, 
 and the rest of us swimming. 
I'm a commercial 
white-water raft guide. 
I know Gervase can't swim, 
 but my guess 
is that they'll put him 
 in the boat, rowing. 
I could beat him 
 any day of the week. 
JEFF: 
 But their overconfidence 
 cost them dearly. 
Is that what 
you wanted, Jeff? 
I got beat by a guy 
 who couldn't even swim. 
JEFF: 
 Their loss sent them 
 back to Tribal Council, 
where the voting alliance 
 reared its ugly head. 
Dirk, the tribe 
 has spoken. 
11 castaways remain. 
Who will be voted off 
 tonight? 
It's day 16 on the island 
and the survivors are starting 
to plan for their future. 
Until now, the two tribes 
 have been adversaries. 
We got it, 
 we got it. 
( all cheering ) 
They built separate societies 
and have established 
 their own routines. 
But in the game of Survivor 
everything must change. 
Three days from now 
the two tribes will be forced 
to merge into 
 a single new tribe. 
Will they continue to vote 
along old tribal lines 
 after the merger, 
or will it be everyone 
 for themselves? 
This week's episode 
 finds the impending merger 
on everyone's mind. 
( screeching ) 
SUSAN: 
 We're having a Pagong day. 
We're laying around 
 doing nothing. 
RICHARD: 
 This is an interesting point 
 in the game right here-- 
right on the verge of the merge.
Two nights before we merge, 
it's an interesting time. 
Change is coming, 
 as they say. 
KELLY: 
 I think it'll be cool 
 when we merge. 
I think they're nice people. 
I don't think they're 
taking this... seriously. 
They're playing Island 90210. 
They think that they'll go 
 to their little mud volcano 
and give each other facials 
and they don't need 
 to really do anything 
because they're just here to... 
look cute on TV, I don't know. 
SUSAN: 
 They better send them 
 with some supplies, 
that's all I can say. 
There's three of them 
 that we need out of here. 
Greg. 
Greg, definitely. 
He's just way too psychotic. 
The other one is 
 speedball-- Jenna. 
She can get old 
pretty quickly. 
SUSAN: 
 She... yeah, she's going to 
 grow old real fast on us. 
Gervase. He's a pervert.
He's gone. 
And the chickens 
 all better be dead 
because they'll be 
 dead when they get here.
( chicken squawking ) 
JOEL: 
 One hour to chicken time. 
T-minus one hour. 
We're going to wait 
 till about another hour 
and then we're 
 going to chop their head off. 
We'll take 
 the little nasty one first. 
And pull out all their feathers.
( squawking ) 
I think not everybody 
 wants to participate 
in the chopping of the head. 
I can't-- I mean, come on, 
 it's a little chicken. 
There is not going to be 
a trace of that thing on Earth. 
GRETCHEN: 
 I don't have 
 any emotional attachment. 
From the moment I saw them, 
 they were food. 
You know, they never 
 were pets to me. 
I don't enjoy killing things. 
It's not, like, 
 a thrill to kill something, 
but anybody who eats meat 
has to realize 
 that somebody killed that. 
Someone's killing it for you. 
COLLEEN: 
 I don't want to watch it die. 
I want to have it 
put on my plate 
 and put in front of me. 
GERVASE: 
 I'm missing food the most. 
I could go 
 for some chicken right now. 
Any kind: baked, fried, 
 I don't care-- food. 
Go ahead. 
( laughing ) 
One, two, three. 
I just like to ignore 
 that whole aspect 
of, uh, the food chain-- 
 the whole death part. 
If you're going to 
 be upset about this,
then you should 
 be a vegetarian 
'cause this is how 
every animal starts out. 
JENNA: 
 Oh, we're going to eat, uh, 
 three chickens in three days. 
We want to eat them 
 before we merge tribes. 
We don't want them 
 getting any of our chickens. 
Besides, one of them 
 was pecking the hell out of me.
It is the one that 
 was pecking me? 
Yeah, that's it. 
Sweet justice. 
I've interacted 
 with the chickens 
as little as possible. 
I'm not petting them, 
 putting them on leashes, 
taking them for walks, 
 naming them 
and, you know, 
 calling them my very own. 
It does no good 
 to befriend dinner. 
JENNA: 
 I've never gone 
 through the process 
of feeding a chicken, 
 watering a chicken, 
then butchering a chicken. 
Yum. 
Ooh, yeah! 
I can smell the, 
 like, the grease and... 
And it's going to fry 
 and bubble and... ( sighs ) 
Mmm! Dinner. 
Chicken! 
Yeah, we're lucky, man. 
Very, very good. 
Oh, my God. 
Got my greasy flavor 
 back in my mouth. 
GRETCHEN: 
 People were happy before, 
 I know 
that the nutrition 
 hit their bodies. 
It was, I think, 
 the first really recognizable 
piece of protein 
 that people have had 
that, you know, everybody 
kind of knew what it was 
and make you feel 
 like you chewed on something. 
( gristle snapping ) 
JOEL: 
 Just like a 
 little kid--
I hit the end of
 the bones and 
 the marrow... 
There's really a lot
 of protein in there.
GRETCHEN: 
 I think, mentally, 
 the chicken was more important 
than it was physically. 
We have three 
 chickens. 
After we're done
 eating those... 
we're back on track.
RICHARD: 
 It's funny when I hear 
"How come you're naked 
 all the time?" 
I'm naked less than one percent 
 of the time. 
I'd like to be naked 
 all the time. 
That would be smarter 
 in this 100-degree weather. 
( laughing ) 
Richard's naked.
Is he naked? 
KELLY: 
 He walks around naked 
 quite a bit. 
I think it probably 
 bugs some of the guys. 
Seems kind of childish 
 and immature to me 
and kind of grandstanding 
and walking around 
 on national TV. 
Your life, my life, 
 different things-- who cares? 
Something like that. 
RUDY: 
 He runs around pretty often 
 without clothes on 
and he don't 
 think nothing of it. 
Peachy. 
I couldn't care less whether 
guys or girls are around. 
It doesn't make any difference. 
If there's any horny gay men 
 out there 
that want a horny guy in return,
 I know one. 
Naked isn't sexual to me, 
 and it doesn't... 
I don't think of it that way, 
 it doesn't faze me that way 
so, no, 
 I'm pretty comfortable naked. 
RUDY: 
 I don't agree 
 with his lifestyle 
and I told him that, 
and he probably 
 don't agree with mine. 
But, anyway, 
 we got to work together 
up until this merger, anyway. 
There's money 
 at stake. 
We're all 
 trying to win...
uh, the pot.
RUDY: 
 I finally went along 
 with this alliance 
and if I didn't, 
 I'd be out of here 
probably the next vote 
 or the one after. 
I think, with an alliance 
 that we establish here, 
we can do very, very well. 
If you don't, you're out. 
That's all there is to it. 
Exactly. Tell me what 
 option you have. 
RICHARD: 
 I've been trying to support 
 keeping Rudy from day one. 
I want to bring him along 
to the next round where... 
he won't care much 
and probably will get voted off 
 before, uh... winning. 
You think they 
wouldn't do it to us? 
No, of course 
 they would. 
RICHARD: 
 I don't think 
somebody's in control 
 of our group, in particular. 
I think... 
I'm in control of... 
who's being voted off 
and I think that's all 
 that matters to me. 
( quiet talking ) 
( giggling ) 
? It's a beautiful day 
 in the neighborhood ? 
? A beautiful day 
for a neighbor ? 
? Would you 
be mine? ? 
? Would you be mine? ? 
Morning, Greg. 
Morning, Gretchen. 
GERVASE: 
 I made a totally dumb 
 statement now that I regret. 
You know, 
it was kind of just 
a poke at the girls, 
 give them a little shot. 
JENNA: 
 He sets it up first 
with "Don't take offense 
 to this, but women are 
the stupidest things 
 on the planet next to cows." 
"Girls are the stupidest 
 thing on the planet 
next to cows" was the remark. 
( shrieks ) 
You called us stupid. 
Who? Not me. 
Don't get me in this. 
The whole context 
 of the story was-- 
we were talking 
 about relationships 
and how guys and girls 
 will do stupid things 
if you like the person. 
Oh, we never 
got around 
to the stupid 
things guys do. 
If you like somebody 
that much, you'll do 
something stupid 
 you should maybe not do. 
We're not as stupid as cows, 
we're a step above. 
GRETCHEN: 
 Well, I said, 
"You know, Gervase, 
 I told those girls 
"that all they had to do 
"was, like, when they write 
your name on that piece of paper
"and hold it up to the camera 
they can look straight 
 into the lens and go, 'moo.'" 
His mouth dropped open 
 like he had never considered 
that maybe that was not 
 the best thing to say 
to a woman who had 
that much power over him. 
No, I'm being very apologetic 
 because it was stupid. 
I mean... a-after I said it, 
 you know, I could... 
after I said it... 
The remorse 
he showed... 
He was, like, in this box 
with no fricking way out. 
Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.
She was there 
to hear it. 
If you let them talk 
 long enough, 
they'll probably 
 get you out of the box. 
GERVASE: 
They probably will. 
They're good for that. 
Gervase is... 
He's on a free ride, man. 
He's untouchable. 
I don't know 
 how he gets through. 
He called the women cows. 
He doesn't do stuff 
 half the time. 
GERVASE: 
 I haven't done 
a thing out here since 
 I've been here, it seems like, 
and that's cool. 
Joel does the fishing. 
He does the paddling. 
I'm just out there 
 hanging on the raft with him. 
The expert fisherman that I am. 
When they built 
 that hut on the beach, 
I was nowhere near there. 
I was in the shade somewhere. 
You know, I was looking 
 for a coconut or something. 
I think everybody 
 has done cooking rice 
at one point in time. 
I have yet to cook anything. 
JENNA: 
 I didn't see him 
 do anything yesterday, 
but that is nothing new, 
 and that surprises me 
that I still haven't 
 voted for Gervase. 
He doesn't seem 
 to pull his own weight, 
and I know for a fact 
 that he voted against me, 
so why the hell 
 haven't I voted for him? 
I don't know. 
GERVASE: 
I knew coming here was all about
charm and personality. 
That will get me through. 
His charm does 
 get him through, you know, 
but he hasn't been 
 so charming today, 
so maybe 
 he's going to get the vote. 
JEFF: 
 The Tagi Tribe 
has lost the last two 
 reward challenges 
and they're growing 
 more hungry each day, 
but tonight there is another 
 reward challenge, for food. 
My guess is this is a clue. 
"There once was a base 
 on this island 
"where the soldiers 
 were known for stockpilin'. 
"The Army's left town, 
but their stuff's still around. 
Move fast and you 
 may go home smilin'." 
Probably a map. 
Oh, there's 
 food in here. 
We'll be able to eat it 
 for dinner. Come on. 
It's still 
 dinnertime. 
You never know. 
What do you 
 think it is?
Smell anything yet? 
Stewed tomatoes. That'd suck. 
Looks like dog food.
Aw, dog food, man! 
Dog food. That's what 
 I said right away. 
Smells good, though. 
That is definitely dog food.
Let me see. 
Oh, yeah, Alpo. 
Come on, Rich. 
Yeah, it smells 
 like beef stew. 
Come on, just taste it. 
Just taste 
a little bit. 
You don't want some? 
No. 
Yeah! Go, Rich. 
Wow. 
All right. 
Oh! 
Yeah! 
It might be ravioli.
GERVASE: 
 It could be some natural thing 
 from the island, man. 
Larvae in tomato sauce. 
Nice. 
We don't know 
 if this even is food. 
Maybe just water. 
I think it's chili. 
Um... 
I mean, I could think 
 it would be dog food. 
I-I think 
it might be dog food. 
GERVASE: 
 We've just eaten good chicken. 
I'm not going 
to ruin that chicken 
with damn dog food. 
GREG: 
 Go for it. 
It's dog food. 
Purina Chow-Chow. 
No, I would say Alpo. 
Make your coat 
nice and shiny. 
Yeah, your hair 
 will look good. 
Here, take a 
 taste. Be a man.
Put your finger in 
 there and eat it. 
Are you going 
 to eat it with me? 
Oh, cool. 
That's gravy, actually. 
You'll want to cook it 
 the whole way. 
I don't 
 understand. 
It's just dog food. 
What if it's dog? 
GREG: 
 I choose my preservatives 
and chemicals wisely, 
 and that really would 
have thrown 
everything off-balance. 
I just don't 
 recognize most of it. 
I don't recognize 
any of it, actually. 
Over saltines, 
it's like pate. 
JOEL: 
 Your standards 
 definitely, definitely 
take a dive when you come 
into a situation like this. 
When you get hungry, 
 you'll eat anything. 
I took a good 
four or five bites 
and I'm... 
I'm good. You? 
Yeah, I'm done. 
You're done. 
JEFF: 
 At tonight's reward challenge, 
 we're going to find out 
just how motivated 
 our hungry tribes are. 
During World War II, 
this area was a hot spot 
 of military activity. 
So, the premise 
 of this challenge: 
Fleeing troops have just 
 abandoned their barracks 
and left behind 
 some very useful items... 
two can openers... 
two pocketknives... 
and two Army helmets. 
One member 
from each tribe 
will go 
in together. 
You'll have 
a flashlight. 
You'll look for these items. 
You can only find 
one item per person. 
You come back out, 
you hand off the flashlight, 
which sort of acts like a baton,
to the next person 
 and they go in. 
Be careful. 
If you bring back 
a duplicate item 
your tribe will 
be disqualified. 
Here's a little bit about what 
 you're playing for tonight. 
We've got some good canned food.
Peas, some tuna, 
a little dessert. 
Is that chocolate? 
That is chocolate. 
First tribe back 
with all the items 
 on the list wins. 
You guys ready? 
The tribe 
 is ready! 
Go! 
Go, Jenna. All 
 right, all right. 
Hey, don't 
 knock her down. 
I have the 
 Army helmet.
We're close. Here. 
I have the Army helmet. 
White can opener, pocketknife. 
I got the pocketknife. 
We need the can opener. 
Take the list. 
Can opener, can opener. 
Can opener, Rich! 
Rich! Gervase 
 found the 
 can opener! 
Run, run, 
 run! Run! Move! 
( cheering ) 
No! 
The can opener? 
Bummer. 
I think we got 
some bad news. 
Thank you, Rich,
 thank you. 
A pocketknife. 
Tough break. You thought 
you had the can opener. 
You actually had the second 
 knife, Pagong's knife. 
It goes to them. 
That's your 
three items. 
Victory for Pagong. 
( cheering ) 
It's over. 
( cheering and shrieking ) 
Chocolate! 
None for you! 
Hey. 
JEFF: 
Tagi. 
Sorry, once again, 
it's a winner-take-all. 
Pagong, once again, 
 you're taking all. 
Some M.R.E.S, some canned food 
and this, which you might want 
to keep away from the fire 
'cause it will 
melt very fast. 
And from Jenna. 
There goes 
the midnight snack. 
Good night, guys. 
Good night. 
We are so close 
right now to being 
the final six 
people here. 
It's right there. 
Now it's looking 
like this is... 
actually could 
happen, like 
one of us 
 could actually walk away 
with $1 million, 
 out of our team. 
One more win 
 and it's in the bag. 
JOEL: 
When they do merge these tribes,
if we're not sticking together 
 as a team, 
they're just going to 
 pick us off one by one. 
I just know it's
 going to happen.
Tomorrow, we'll just... 
 all of us have to say 
either, yes, we're going to 
stick together or no, we're not.
We have to win 
 the next immunity 
 challenge bad. 
We have to really 
 concentrate and win.
We need six and 
 they need four 
so we can vote them off.
GERVASE: 
We need to stick together, 
 really, 
as Pagong, still, 
 and just wipe them out. 
Just pick them off 
 one by one. 
JOEL: 
 Colleen-- she said 
 that she does not want to vote 
anybody on our team off 
until all of their team is gone.
We want to stick together. 
Jenna also has said 
 that she is not 
going to vote anybody 
 on our team off. 
Greg said openly that he's not 
going to vote anybody 
 on the team off. 
Gervase has said it openly. 
I've said it 
 numerous times openly. 
I've never heard Gretchen say 
"I want to keep 
 this team together." 
What do you 
 think, Gretchen?
GRETCHEN: 
 I don't see myself 
 joining a voting alliance, 
but if it's somebody 
that I'm thinking of voting off,
that would be great. 
I'll vote along 
 with everybody else. 
If we win, 
and we go in with an advantage, 
we just all got 
 to stick together, 
stay as a team like 
we've been doing all the while. 
Joel seems to be ignoring 
 the fact 
that we have one more 
 immunity challenge 
before we combine the tribes, 
and if we lose it, 
somebody's being voted off, 
 and he talked way too much 
about what he's going to do 
 when the tribes are combined 
the strategy, the combination-- 
 da-da-da. 
What if he doesn't make it 
to the combining of the tribes? 
I know that ladies' man 
has irritated every woman 
 in this tribe, so... 
JOEL: 
 I'm not a chauvinist. 
I believe that a woman can do 
 anything a man can do. 
Joel thinks 
 he's the all-American 
and all 
 of these physical challenges 
are just feeding his ego. 
Go ahead. If you want to compete
with me, I'm fine with it. 
Oh, my. 
I haven't wrecked anything, 
I haven't broken anything, 
I haven't lost any competitions.
You know, he's Golden Boy. 
 He's Mr. January-- 
he's going to have a calendar. 
( all cheering ) 
He's Captain America, really. 
I can't really think 
of anything that I've done 
that's bad. 
Towards us ladies, he seems 
 to be pretty condescending 
like, he has to explain 
 everything so thoroughly 
that we just couldn't 
 understand it without Joel. 
Throw it over there 
and then kind of tie it 
to one of these things. 
Let's just try it 
 like this first. 
I know that gamy taste 
 is going to be pretty harsh. 
I don't see 
 why he feels the need 
to treat us like we're children.
I wouldn't pry 
with that. 
I wouldn't pry 
with the tip of that. 
We have a butter knife 
over there? 
He is full of, "Don't do this," 
"Put it here," "do that," 
 "Watch out," da-da-da. 
Well, then, get up and do it. 
You can't be a woman 
 who's strong enough 
to volunteer to come here 
 and take what comes... 
You want me 
to get that for you? 
...and then overlook a comment 
like he doesn't trust you 
 to cook the rice. 
Have we been 
throwing the water 
and the rice in there 
all at one time? 
Yeah. Why? 
I just wondered. 
Usually, at home, 
I boil the water 
and then I throw 
the rice in. 
A woman just is not capable 
of doing the things 
 as good as he is. 
We'll go without 
 some rice for a little 
 while and it'll be okay.
GRETCHEN: 
 And it took us a while to even 
 bring it up to each other, 
but once we did, 
 it's, like, "Oh, you feel 
that way, too?" And I know that,
you know, all three of us 
are feeling that. 
All right, I 
 said what I said. 
I'm totally square with 
 everything across the board-- 
whatever anybody thinks-- 
um, but, no, I definitely am not
 a chauvinist. 
JEFF: 
 For the last immunity challenge
 before the merger, 
an official 
 U.S. Army obstacle course 
has been constructed 
 by the Green Berets. 
Hey, Rudy, look behind you. 
Oh, wow. 
RUDY: 
 I was surprised when I seen 
the two Special Forces guys 
 come down the beach. 
At first, I thought 
they were British marines, 
but, uh, they were American. 
Good evening, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
I have your orders here 
your mission statement. 
It should answer 
all the questions. 
It's a biggie, Rudy. 
It's an operation, man. 
Uh-oh. 
Snake Island 
obstacle course. 
I can do the obstacle course, 
but not as fast as I used to 
and, uh, 
 it's only going to be... 
The winner's going to be as fast
 as your slowest person, 
so, uh, maybe I can beat 
 one of the girls. 
Appreciate it. 
Thank you. 
Welcome to Pagong. 
Thank you. 
I have the orders 
for tomorrow's challenge. 
Read them; make sure 
 you understand exactly 
what's expected 
 of you tomorrow.
I wish you all the best of luck.
Go in there with a good, 
 positive frame of mind, 
good attitude. 
Thank you. 
GERVASE: 
 We're all going to be excited, 
 hyped up. 
I want them to challenge us 
 and push us, you know, 
make us work hard 
 for this victory, 
'cause, I mean... we're coming 
full steam ahead at them. 
JEFF: 
 Day 18 on the island. 
For the past few days, 
the tribes have had their minds 
on just one thing-- the merger. 
Tomorrow, 
the two tribes become one. 
Nobody can predict 
the impact of unification. 
As new alliances will form, 
 strategies will change. 
That makes today's 
 immunity challenge critical. 
If Tagi loses, 
 they enter the merger 
outnumbered by Pagong 
 six to four 
and could then be eliminated 
 by a Pagong voting alliance. 
We're thinking 
 we can do this. 
JEFF: 
 On the other hand, 
 if Pagong loses, 
the tribes will merge even 
 at five members each. 
Joel and Jenna will run 
the first half of the course 
 for Pagong; 
Sean and Kelly for Tagi. 
They will meet their 
 two fellow tribe members-- 
Rich and Susan for Tagi, and 
 Gretchen and Greg for Pagong-- 
at an obstacle called 
 "blown bridge." 
All four will negotiate 
 this obstacle 
and then race 
 to the finish line, 
where the tribe members who are
 not participating in the race--
Rudy for Tagi 
and Colleen and Gervase 
 for Pagong-- 
are waiting to cheer them on. 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Yeah, you guys! 
( cheering ) 
Let's go, Pagong! 
Come on! 
Come on, Joel, 
pick up the pace, baby! 
Come on! 
Throw that rope 
back, Jenna, throw 
that rope back! 
Whoo! 
Come on, Jenna! 
Go, go, go! 
JEFF: 
 The blown bridge 
requires them 
 to now stop and think 
because this obstacle 
 involves strategy. 
We got to get up... 
JEFF: 
 The runners are carrying 
 the instructions 
on how to proceed. 
We have to start 
from here. 
JEFF: 
 Each tribe is given 
 four boards of various lengths.
The object: use the boards 
 to move all four tribe members 
across the pylons 
 without touching the sand. 
You can only 
 use the tops. 
Oh, really? 
We're still 
 shifting boards around. 
Guys, too short, too short. 
We got to...
It doesn't matter 
 if they're ahead of you. 
Just take your time. 
Watch your hand. 
Okay, get up, 
 get up, get up. 
Well, guess what? 
Okay. 
You got... give me 
something else. 
Come on, come on. 
 Pick it up and hand 
 it this way quick. 
We got one 
 more to go. 
Never panic, never panic, 
 never panic. 
Relax. 
Don't worry 
 about it. 
You don't worry about it. 
Okay, you guys... 
I'm down, 
 I'm down. 
We possibly could be ahead. 
Hold on, hold on, 
 Greg, that's okay. 
Come on, Greg, let's go! 
( cheering ) 
Yeah, go! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Let's go! Come on! 
Let's go! 
Get to that stick! 
Let's go, Jenna!
Pull it out!
 Pull it out!
 Pull it out!
Go, go! 
Come on!
Let's go! 
Come on!
Move it! Move it! 
Move it, move 
 it! Come on! 
Go, go! Go! 
Don't stop! 
 Don't stop! 
Whoo! 
Nice finish. 
Nice going. 
Nice going, you guys. 
Outstanding, outstanding. 
Outstanding. 
Outstanding. 
Outstanding. 
Sue, give me a hug. 
Wow. 
Suck it up, man. 
Good job, good job. 
JEFF: 
 Tagi has won and must now 
 paddle out to Snake Island 
to retrieve the immunity idol. 
Look for the snakes; 
 you'll find the idol. 
The snakes, we'll 
 find the idol. 
Yes.
All right, 
 who did it? 
Who did it? 
Who counted that chicken 
before it hatched? 
Who counted the chickens? 
JOEL: 
 The thing is, we're coming back
 after the challenge, you know--
I'm sore, you know-- we lost. 
Tired, beat up-- 
coming back here thinking, 
"All right, we're going 
 to have some chicken." 
Um... coming up the trail 
and what do I see? 
I come around the box... 
and that little one 
 was still there. 
Had his head 
 stuck in the side of the box. 
Just pulling. 
 And I yelled and he took off. 
( hissing ) 
The monitor got 
 the biggest meal of the day. 
I mean, that monitor 
 ate twice as much at one meal 
than I've eaten since 
 I've been on this island, man. 
Totally ate my chicken. 
They are vicious, vicious, 
vicious animals. 
I mean, they look so docile 
in the wild. 
And we're not 
 throwing it away. 
That's... half the 
 chicken's there. 
I guess. 
And it's fresh. 
Poor, poor dinner. 
Don't be sad. 
It's all right, 
 though, guys. 
 It's okay. 
GRETCHEN: 
 You boil it long enough, 
 you can eat anything, 
and it's already 
 been tenderized... 
and gutted and decapitated, 
so half the work is done. 
I don't like going 
 to Tribal Council. 
( chuckling ): 
Hmm... really! 
Really. 
GRETCHEN: 
 The Tribal Council 
is a necessary 
 part of the game. 
But it's the nasty part 
 of the game. 
It's the part 
 that I enjoy the least 
and that I could do without. 
I don't know who's going to go.
Could be anybody. 
JOEL: 
 I've seen how Jenna acted 
the last couple times when 
 she voted against somebody. 
She really didn't 
 want to look at them 
or talk to them-- 
 she showed guilt 
and she hasn't... 
 she's really been avoiding me 
the last couple days. 
JENNA: 
 I know who my vote is, 
 and it... it would be Joel, 
but, uh, I can't speak 
for the rest of the tribe. 
I got a vote last time, 
 so maybe I'll be off. 
I don't know. 
There's all 
 three aces. 
COLLEEN: 
 Gervase-- he's just 
 as chauvinistic 
as Joel is, God! 
He just hides it better. 
Oh, are you done? 
Not yet. 
COLLEEN: 
 I want to vote for him 
 at the next Tribal Council 
because he voted for me, 
and I'm starting 
 to just have, like 
these little conflicts with him.
( all groaning ) 
GERVASE: 
Oh, my God! 
COLLEEN: 
 This game is much too vicious 
 for my blood. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
I'm going to be back home and 
be, like, "God, that's so easy."
GERVASE: 
 I feel like,
 when we go, 
to Tribal Council 
 and boot one person off, 
feels like this is the end 
 of our Survivor run here 
and we're all about 
 to go back to our lives 
and I won't 
 talk to these guys... 
( thunder rumbling ) 
Looks like we're going 
 to get rained on... 
or them. 
I think this stuff's 
 going to pass by us. 
( whooping ) 
( thunderclap ) 
Okay. 
Another night of reckoning 
 at Tribal Council. 
So tonight's agenda 
is the same as always 
 at Tribal Council. 
You guys will have to 
 vote off one member. 
So, before we 
 get to that-- 
Joel, were you surprised 
 to lose today? 
You know... 
I don't know 
 if we were really surprised. 
I mean, I knew that 
we were physically 
stronger and faster. 
But we pushed it 
as hard as we could today 
and, uh, came up 
 a little bit short this time. 
It's no big secret 
 about the, uh... 
comments that were made 
regarding women 
 in comparison to an animal. 
( laughing ) 
God, those cows! 
What was your take on that, 
 Gretchen? 
It's being made light of here, 
but it... from what I gathered, 
it wasn't necessarily 
 taken all that lightly. 
Um, I wasn't there 
 for the initial conversation. 
They were storytelling 
at night, I think, 
and I don't really believe 
 that Gervase-- 
oh, were we not supposed 
 to say who...? 
( all laughing ) 
Come on! 
What do you 
 mean, "Come on"?
You didn't say it? 
You know, 
Jeff... 
I do not even recall 
saying these words and... 
( women groaning ) 
Oh, my God! 
I mean... 
And you know what? 
 You know what, Gervase? 
Right now is when 
they're going to play you 
saying the words. 
( laughing ) 
It sounds so much 
 like Joel, though. 
When I listen to it, 
 it sounds so much like Joel. 
"Don't let me offend 
 you or anything, but... 
but women are the 
 stupidest things 
 on Earth..." 
So, to clear it up 
from your guys' take 
 on it, Jenna, 
who... did you link Joel in 
that group, also? 
JOEL: 
I got linked 
into this somehow. 
Well, uh, 
it was this thing: 
( hearty laughter ): 
"Yeah!" 
It kind of linked him. 
I don't know. 
That's all right. 
Whatever. 
Gervase, last 
 time I asked you
 if you felt... 
if anybody here 
 felt invincible,
you were the first 
 one to pipe up. 
You said, "I'm not 
 going anywhere." 
You still feel 
 that way tonight? 
I refuse to answer that question
 on the grounds... 
( all laughing ) 
...that my invincibility 
may be affected by that. 
( all laughing ) 
So that's a "yes." 
Yes! 
I'm feeling 
 real good tonight. 
Why?
Just because, man, I... 
I don't know what it is. 
I mean, 
 it might just be me, but... 
I'm feeling good. 
JEFF: 
 Anybody here 
 want to own up 
to feeling 
 a little... 
uncertain about 
 their future 
in the next five
 to ten minutes? 
It's time to vote. 
Joel. 
I just, uh, had to vote. 
I picked Joel for two reasons, 
 both small ones. 
He seems a bit 
 condescending to women 
and it makes 
 it difficult to work with 
and, two-- he seems to have 
the most money of anybody, so...
I think he needs to win less. 
There's no good reason why, 
but it's got to be 
 for somebody, and, uh... 
that's who I'm going with 
 for now. 
It's time 
and he's a little 
 too condescending 
towards us ladies. 
Moo. 
I'm just a step above a cow. 
On the island, 
 fire represents life. 
Here at Tribal Council, 
your torches
 represent 
your life, 
 your identity. 
Directly across 
 from you 
are the five torches 
from the first 
five people voted off. 
Tonight, one of 
 your torches 
will be added 
 to that group. 
I'll go tally 
 the votes. 
Let's read 
 the votes. 
First vote: 
"Joel." 
"Jenna."
"Joel." 
"Jenna."
Two votes for Joel, 
 two votes for Jenna.
"Joel." 
Last vote. 
"Joel." 
The tribe 
 has spoken. 
It's time for 
 you to go. 
Good-bye. 
To the rest of you guys: 
whole new ball game tomorrow. 
Two tribes will merge into one. 
You can head back 
 to your camp. 
We'll talk 
 tomorrow. 
Good night. 
JEFF: 
 Next week on Survivor: 
The two tribes 
 merge into one. 
RICHARD: 
 I think it'll be interesting. 
I think it'll set up 
 a whole nother set 
of interpersonal dynamics. 
JENNA: 
 This group will work out 
 so well. 
GREG: 
 This new group is like... 
it's like a banquet! 
RUDY: 
 It's a pain in the ass. 
If you want to win this money, 
 you got to get dirty. 
I wish I could've made it 
a little longer. 
I think maybe 
 the girls on the team 
maybe had a little 
 inferiority complex 
that they took some 
 of these remarks wrong. 
They think 
 I'm a chauvinist. 
I am definitely not. 
I mean, so, that 
 is my main regret-- 
that I'm going 
 to leave here 
and I got, you know, 
four people 
that think 
I'm a chauvinist.
