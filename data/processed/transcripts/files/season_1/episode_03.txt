         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans forced 
 to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Marooned for 39 days, 
they must work together 
 to build shelter, 
find food 
 and survive the island. 
But ultimately, it is 
 everyone for themselves. 
Every third night, they will 
 hike deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, only one will remain
and will leave the island 








with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor... 
B.B's anger 
 with the Pagong Tribe 
reached a fevered pitch. 
I've been working 
my ass off. 
A lot of you have been 
 laying on your ass watching. 
Put the carrying log-- 
 we're right in... 
all the way over now. 
If we're building a health gym, 
I'll let you do it. 
Damn it. Walk 
 straight in. 
It may not be that right, 
but how many times we got 
to make those decisions? 
JEFF: 
 At Tagi, the conflict 
between Stacey and Rudy 
 deepened. 








RUDY: 
 Me and her wouldn't get along. 
If we were friends 
 on the outside 
I'd definitely avoid her. 
STACEY: 
 We've all seen him 
 eating extra food, 
and he's just sort of 
 a liability to us. 
He was sitting around 
 barking orders 
and not really helping out much.
RUDY: 
 She's too prim-like, you know. 
I mean, uh, 
after about three weeks 
 out here in this jungle 
she's going to learn a lesson, 
 I think. 
JEFF: 
 And Richard shared openly 
 with his tribe mates. 
There is a lifestyle 
 associated with being gay, 
but you can't say 
 I decided to be gay. 
RUDY: 
 The homosexual, he's one 
 of the nicest guys I ever met. 
Me and Richard got to be 
 pretty good friends-- 
not in a homosexual way, 
 that's for sure. 
JEFF: 
 At the immunity challenge, 
 Stacey pulled through 
by winning 
 the final unappetizing round...
SEAN: 
 Swallow!
Open! 
 JEFF: 
 Tagi! 
...forcing Pagong 
 to take the long hike 
to the Tribal Council 
where B.B.'S 
 volatile personality 
finally caught up with him. 
"B.B." 
B.B., the tribe
 has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go.
All right. 
JEFF: 
 14 are left. 
Tonight, one more will go. 
KELLY: 
I keep forgetting where I am... 
when I wake up. 
The plan now is to go out 
and try to do 
 some early morning fishing. 
SEAN: 
 Fishing is horrible. 
That saying, "There's 
 a lot of fish in the sea"? 
Not this sea. 
They apparently didn't grow up 
 in Palua Tiga, 
uh, because there is nothing 
 to be caught out there. 
SUSAN: 
 As far as 
 the food holding up, uh, 
I don't... I think 
 we're into day seven. 
I lost track, but I know 
it's starting to whittle down. 
I know we got to get fish 
 in here. 
( conch shell blowing ) 
SUSAN: 
 You want to check 
 the one on the left first? 
KELLY AND STACEY: 
Yeah. 
 We're going by that first. 
KELLY: 
 Come on, 
 fish in the trap. 
Rocks do not want to take 
her down on that one end. 
Okay. 
Nothing. 
Bait's all gone. 
KELLY: 
 This is frustrating. 
I mean, it's the ocean. 
You think you'd get a fish 
 somehow, but no luck so far. 
We all thought, "Oh, yeah, 
 you know, we got these traps, 
we got hooks, we got a raft." 
You know, there's no reason 
 why we shouldn't be having 
big, fat fish for dinner 
 every night, 
but we're just not. 
To me, that's kind of like 
uh, yeah, whoo-hoo, 
big survivors, you know? 
When was the last time 
Rudy went on a water run? 
He never did, did he? 
I don't think 
he's been 
on a water run. 
He's sneaky. 
He is. 
 He's sneaky.
He swipes food 
while he's in there 
cooking in the kitchen. 
STACEY: 
 I think we've all sort of 
 come to the conclusion 
that Rudy really needs 
 to get out of here. 
He just criticizes 
 whatever we're doing. 
He's hurting morale. 
We row out yesterday morning 
 and set the traps. 
I come into the kitchen. 
"Morning, Rudy, 
 how are you doing?" 
"You're wasting your time 
 out there. 
It's just a waste." 
I was, like, "Damn, 
 morning to you, too." 
 What the hell. 
SUSAN: 
Well, he's wasting his time 
by doing nothing, though. 
KELLY: 
 I think we were all 
 kind of stoked that, you know, 
yeah, he's an ex-Navy Seal, 
We're going to kick ass. 
But he really hasn't 
 contributed very much. 
I think it's definitely 
 going to influence me 
the next time I go 
 to Tribal Council. 
I think it's influencing 
 all of us, you know. 
When it comes down, you know, 
to-to voting people 
that we do like off, I... 
it's sucky, but I think 
 it's going to come down 
to whoever screws up 
 at the challenges. 
SUSAN: 
 Yeah, 'cause I already
 know who I'd vote for.
The person that's least 
 contributing to the group... 
out of here. 
I have conflicts-- 
 personality conflicts 
every day with people. 
I deal with them, I work with 
them, I live with them, I go on.
I'm going to do 
 the same thing here: 
I'm going to get rid 
of the weakest member 
 and vote Stacey out. 
Stacey's trying to buddy up 
 with everybody 
because she knows 
 she's the weakest. 
STACEY: 
 When Kelly, Sue and I 
 were on the raft 
we talked about 
 who we'd vote off. 
Sue initially didn't want 
 to talk about it, 
which immediately clued me in 
that she was planning 
 to vote me off, 
even though we decided 
 to stick together. 
So now I don't trust her 
 as far as I can throw her, 
which, according to the group, 
 would be not far. 
Did you catch 
 anything? 
SUSAN: 
 No fish.
We set the 
 traps up though.
Set the fish traps? 
That's it? 
Just... yeah, no fish. 
We didn't fish 
 but 20 minutes.
COLLEEN: 
 The oomph is a little gone 
 from our group. 
I don't know why that is. 
I think that not eating 
is a factor of our mood. 
We want food. 
Gretchen, Colleen and Greg, 
they were out looking 
 for tapioca 
so that we could have 
mashed-potato style 
 tapioca root. 
It's tapioca, for sure. 
( all chuckling ) 
Just take a bite, 
and see what... 
No. Maybe it's just tapioca 
run wild. 
( chuckling ) 
Operation Tapioca has everything
 to do with finding tapioca, 
but we find other things 
 on the way, too. 
COLLEEN: 
 The first time I came upon 
 the mud volcano 
was with Gretchen and Greg. 
Oh, wow! 
Look at this. Oh! 
Is it blooping?
 Did you see that? 
Oh! Oh... 
GRETCHEN: 
 We stopped 
 at the mud volcanoes for a dip.
We had a good time. 
( laughing ) 
COLLEEN: 
 We walked out of the woods 
like, you know, 
 Lord of the Flies, 
and, uh, I think the others 
were quite interested 
 in our discovery 
so we took a group field trip. 
What is wrong 
with you people? 
Oh, my God! 
GERVASE: 
 It was a great feeling. 
It's just like a nice little 
 celebration for everybody. 
You get together, 
 just get dirty, 
and have a little fun-- 
 have a couple of laughs. 
COLLEEN: 
 Whose leg is...? 
Now we really don't 
want to be voted off. 
JENNA: 
 But it's also just to get away 
 from the daily grind here. 
I mean, we're going to be here 
 39 days. 
You got to keep yourself happy. 
RUDY: 
 I seen Dirk 
 reading his bible today. 
I didn't know 
 he brought a bible. 
"For out of the heart 
 come evil thoughts: 
"Murder, adultery, 
sexual immorality, theft, 
 false testimony, slander." 
DIRK: 
 I just need that quiet time, 
and especially 
a lot of that quiet time 
includes just praying 
 and meditating 
and praising God. 
That's kind of where I feel 
 all my strength and energy 
comes from. 
My testimony is not something 
 I'm afraid to share, 
and that's just part 
of getting to know people 
and at a deeper 
 and deeper level. 
See, the Ten Commandments 
 was an old covenant 
that the Hebrews... 
 that God's chosen nation-- 
the Israelites, 
the Hebrews-- 
 had signed with him, 
but when Christ came, 
he opened the door 
to every human being on Earth. 
SUSAN: 
 I can only take 
 so much preaching. 
I went to church. 
I put my time in. 
I believe in God and all that, 
 but to constantly 
everything always come back 
 on to "Jesus, Jesus"... 
yeah, Dirk's about 
 driving me wild with that. 
It's getting even prettier 
 and prettier. 
Well, thank you. 
STACEY: 
 I think Dirk has 
 a little crush on Kelly. 
He doesn't have 
 a chance in hell. 
Stacey came up to me, 
 "Yeah, I think he likes you." 
I was just, like, "oh, great," 
 you know? 
I-I didn't come out here 
 for that, you know? 
We don't need that. 
DIRK: 
 Kelly's got 
 a serious boyfriend, 
and unless she tells me 
 otherwise, 
that's a line 
 I'm not going to cross. 
I love you. 
But we're-- 
 it's a platonic type of love. 
I think he's really 
 sexually frustrated. 
I've gone 23 years
 without sex. 
I think you guys 
 can go seven weeks.
SUSAN: 
I went a year one time. 
Oh, my God! 
SUSAN: 
 You should 
 try it sometime.
You might like it. 
It's just funny, but... 
I know 
you'll like it. 
No, I know I'm 
 going to love it. 
You'll come back. 
You'll come back. 
It's a gift from God. 
There's no doubt, man. 
I'm obviously not a virgin, 
but if he, uh... 
that's how he wants 
to live his life, that's cool. 
You don't meet too many 23- 
 year-old guys who are virgins. 
He's interesting, 
 being a virgin, 23, 
and not, uh, thinking 
about crossing that line 
 till marriage-- hoo! 
He's extraordinarily religious,
 and I don't know that we'd 
ever be real close as a result 
 of that because we're on such 
different ends 
 of the spectrum religiously. 
DIRK: 
 Rich, you know... 
 homosexual people tend to talk 
about their homosexuality 
all the time, 
 and it's really annoying to me.
It's seems like 
you talk about sex an awful lot.
Nobody's going to tell me 
 what not to do 
or what not to talk about. 
If it's offensive 
 to anybody, 
I stop immediately. 
DIRK: 
 Maybe that's just me, 
 but if he could cut that out, 
it'd almost be perfect 
 around camp. 
Day seven on the island. 
After Pagong's visit 
 to Tribal Council, 
both tribes are now even 
 at seven members. 
Today we'll see what effect 
losing B.B. has on Pagong 
as they prepare 
for their next challenge. 
Both tribes will have their work
 cut out for them today, 
as it requires strength, 
 endurance, 
and most importantly, teamwork. 
Try to go this one alone... 
you'll never make it to shore. 
Yes! 
It's underwater. 
"Lucky for you, there's 
not much to do 
"to prepare for 
 the next big race. 
"Just hold on tight, 
 use all your might 
and stay down till 
you're blue in the face." 
Oh, we're going 
to go diving. 
Hold your breath. 
"Gasping for air, 
 weight you can't bear, 
"before you're done 
 you may quit, 
"the fish you desire 
 are yours to acquire 
if you're the first 
 to the sand spit." 
Yeah, though, it's got 
to be underwater, 
holding your breath, 
getting something 
and getting somewhere. 
Okay. 
Come on, Seal. 
Who could do that? 
Well, that's what it is. 
You know you're diving 
 for something. 
Something underwater, 
 I'm thinking. 
Yeah. 
It's underwater today. 
Cool. 
Either lifting something
 from the bottom 
or carrying it
 underwater, 
or a distant swim 
 underwater 
or something. 
GERVASE: 
 The thing is this: 
everybody knew coming in 
 water wasn't my thing-- 
swimming wasn't my thing, 
 and my team 
knew it from the beginning, 
so when we get into any kind 
 of swimming situation, 
if it's actual swimming, 
 we're going to be struggling. 
You know, they have 
 to compensate for me. 
But that's what a team does. 
JEFF: 
 Hey, guys.
ALL: 
 Hey! 
Tagi, you, you saw 
they're missing a member. 
B.B. got voted off last night. 
Today's challenge 
 is a reward challenge. 
You won't be playing 
 for immunity today. 
That'll happen later. 
Today's challenge strictly 
 for a reward 
that includes a fishing spear. 
Here's the game... 
it is a team game. 
Big emphasis on the tribe. 
What you're going to do is 
you're going to swim out 
to the inner tubes 
 out in the water. 
Directly below the inner tube 
 on either side 
is a sunken treasure chest. 
Get that chest back here 
up on your platform. 
The game is over when one tribe 
 has their chest here 
and every member 
has a hand on the chest. 
The only rule is 
you can't dive down 
 to get the chest 
until everybody is out there 
with a hand on the inner tube. 
So the race really starts here. 
The quicker everybody 
 gets out there, 
the quicker you can dive down 
 and start to move it. 
Anything not clear? 
No? 
Survivors, ready? 
Ready. 
Go! 
Go! Here we go! 
We're going down. 
I think you're... 
I can't get 
 ahold of it.
Everybody... 
Get your hand off. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
( indistinct chatter ) 
( all talking at once ) 
...two, three. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
( all talking ) 
Got it? 
I got it. 
Come on! Come on! 
Stay with us, here... 
Hell, yeah. 
Our beach now, baby. 
Our beach now. 
 That's right, baby. 
( shouting ) 
Put your hands on it! 
 Put your hands on it! 
Tagi! 
Yeah! 
 Whoo! 
Way to go. 
Bring it in, guys,
 bring it in. 
Nice job. 
Man, way to get
 it done, Rudy. 
...than I imagined
 it would be. 
By the time you get 
out, you're so... 
Good work, guys. 
JEFF: 
 All right, here's the deal. 
The key, Mr. Hatch, 
 if you'd like, 
to grab right there. 
Yeah, Rich, 
go get it, baby. 
Go, Richard. 
 Underneath. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
( tribe cheering ) 
Look at all 
 that booty! 
Oh, money, money. 
See you tomorrow. 
( tribal yell ) 
RICHARD: 
 Yesterday's competition 
 was great. 
That was the, uh, pulling 
the treasure up from the water, 
dragging it in and getting 
 a mask and snorkel. 
Oh, baby, that made me 
 feel good. 
I wanted that mask and snorkel 
 from day one... 
to go get, uh, fish. 
SEAN: 
 Rich, he overestimates himself 
 sometimes, 
and we were kind of thinking 
that he wasn't going 
 to catch anything. 
When you snorkel down there, 
there's nothing 
 to even stab at. 
We have a good pole. 
I have my Superpole. 
Uh, which is, you know, 
 it works-- 
in a Gilligan's Island 
 sort of sense. 
We got some maggots, 
we got the Superpole 2000 
and we got the persistence 
 of Dirk and me. 
We can't lose. 
Feeling good today,
 buddy. 
We got to come back 
 with fish tonight. 
If somebody gets a fish 
 on a spear, 
I'll be seriously impressed. 
So will I. Let's see 
if he can do it. 
Well, Rich is confident, man. 
 I appreciate... 
If I was a little fish 
and saw Rich swimming out, 
I wouldn't be 
sticking around long. 
Big gay man 
with a spear 
coming right at me. 
Oh, it's a ray. 
I don't know if 
 it's an angel ray 
or a sting ray. 
RICHARD: 
 This is a good moment for me, 
 'cause I knew people 
were thinking 
I was just full of caca. 
And it was just... 
you know, one of those things 
that I've been 
 talking about fishing, 
talking about what I've 
 been doing all my life... 
We're supposed 
 to eat that thing?
I will. 
Just to make note 
who got the first fish. 
It's not a fish;
 it's a ray. 
Oh! Oh! 
You suck. 
I'm coming back 
in a second 
with a fish. 
I actually think Sean 
 was kind of sad 
that I beat him. 
All right. 
Another ray, huh? 
Now you got two. 
Do we want another ray? 
We don't know 
 if they taste good 
or if they're edible. 
Sean said, "Get something 
that looks like a fish." 
This is a fish. 
Look at that, 
 doesn't that look delicious? 
No more rays. 
Catch a fish. 
If I see a fish, 
 I'll get a fish. 
But if I get rays, 
 I'm going to get rays. 
There are seven people to feed. 
I don't know 
if they taste good. 
I'm not sure I'm 
 following the logic.
I mean, you're sitting here 
fishing... 
 Right. 
For what? 
I see a fish or something 
that looks like a fish-- 
I mean, I'll eat whatever. 
Finally, when I came up 
 with a third one 
they said, 
 "Good job, good job." 
Good work. 
SEAN: 
 He pulled through. 
 He showed his true colors. 
He does know how to spear fish.
He got us a couple of, 
uh, manta rays or whatever 
 the hell they were. 
We got fish. 
No way! No way! 
( screams ) 
Watch the spear. 
Hey, baby. 
Oh, hell, yeah. 
We're eating dinner. 
RICHARD: 
 My position with the tribe-- 
it's probably going to increase 
 as a result of this. 
I talk about the things 
 that I'm capable of doing 
and this might give them that 
"Oh, maybe some of what 
 he's saying is true." 
They're, uh, pretty, 
pretty damn tasty.
 I recommend 
keep catching those...
 they appear to be 
slow, slow, slow. 
Or you know how
 to catch them. 
RICHARD: 
 Thank you.
You need to keep me 
and I'll provide you 
 with the fish you need.
SEAN: 
I don't what I'd do without 
the gay perspective anyway. 
( laughs ) 
I don't see it at all. 
We heard a rumor 
 that the other team 
caught a fish with their spear. 
The mask-- 
 that was definitely the key 
to them starting to get fish. 
And that does worry me 
 a little bit 
'cause they're going to be 
 eating some protein. 
I would definitely rather 
 have fish than rat, but... 
now it doesn't matter-- 
 either/or now. 
JENNA: 
 Ho, I'm so ready to eat rat. 
I want to gut 'em, bone 'em, 
and then we'll have, like, 
 some little rat meat 
in with the rice 
 that we're eating. 
That would be delicious. 
I'm not sure 
 what a rat might taste like. 
Nobody's said anything to me 
about what it could taste like. 
GERVASE: 
 Anytime anybody can hit one 
over the head, we're hitting 
them over the head, too. 
Gretchen hit one 
 the other night-- 
last night-- 
 with the soup spoon. 
GREG: 
 This is not 
 an easy sport.
Oh, no. 
( laughing ): 
That's me! 
The principle of the trap: 
This noose is wrapped around 
 the inside of this area here. 
The bait's in there 
and it's getting tugged out 
 by the rat... 
and the noose goes tight. 
JOEL: 
 They'll lose their point 
 on the rats. 
We're going to 
 chop the head off 
take the guts out, 
 take the skin off, 
cut the feet off, 
 and pull the skin 
 off that way... 
throw a few minnows in there, 
surf and turf; 
 minnows and rats. 
( laughing ): 
 All right! 
I'm telling you guys 
we're not going 
 to want to go home. 
We're set. 
Bring 'em on, baby. 
 Bring 'em on. 
GREG: 
 Rats aren't bad. 
 Rats are rats. 
Questions of edibility 
only have to do 
 with your perceptions. 
GERVASE: 
Smells good. 
Oh, yeah. We're stylin'. 
Want some? 
RAMONA: 
Uh, what does 
it taste like? 
I'm not sure. 
Rat? 
Tastes like rat. 
Almost like chicken,
 a little bit. 
Use your imagination. 
Am I using a lot 
 of imagination? 
Don't smell it. 
Don't smell it? 
No. 
I'm concerned 
that it'll be a bit gamy. 
We won't have quite the gravy 
 we're looking for, 
which would really be helpful. 
Uh, when cooking rats, 
I would imagine the sauce 
 is of the utmost importance. 
As poor as we get in the ghetto,
 we don't ever eat the rats. 
Ever. 
Well, you guys 
 are missing something. 
( laughing ) 
( groans ) 
Here. 
All right. 
( clears throat ) 
Gervase? 
What do you think? 
You having a 
 problem there?
We gots to kill 
some more rats tonight. 
( laughing with Joel ) 
It's on, 
till the break of dawn, 
like hot buttered popcorn! 
Oh, yeah. 
We's about the grub. 
Joel, can you pass the rat? 
Please? 
Why you hogging 
the rat, Joel? 
Now everybody's taking my rat. 
That's really, really good. 
GERVASE: 
 There's plenty of food 
 on the island. 
You won't starve 
 with all these rats. 
There's tons of them 
 and they're everywhere, so... 
there's definitely stuff 
 to eat out here. 
I think people 
 would just rather eat 
some fish instead, that's all. 
We've got a clue. 
RICHARD:
 Cool. 
"Next challenge, 
choose smallest member. Stop. 
"The lighter, the better. Stop. 
"An emergency 
has come up. Stop. 
"Build sturdy, maneuverable 
structure. Stop. 
Tribe's fate may depend on it. 
 Stop." 
That would be Kelly. 
We probably have to carry her, 
or something, somewhere-- 
 a race. 
Through the woods. 
 Maneuverable. 
Right, right. 
RICHARD: 
 Today's immunity challenge day 
so we're building a, uh... 
 stretcher. 
Got to be a strong one. 
We don't know for what, 
 but, uh... 
obviously, it's a competition 
that's going to determine 
who kicks somebody out tonight. 
RICHARD: 
We got our mission, 
Rudy. 
Looks like we got to build 
a stretcher. 
Bamboo... bamboo... 
chicken wire in here, 
a brace here and
 a brace there. 
All right, set it 
 up right there. 
Looks like 
the head's rusty. 
SUSAN: 
 It's important to keep 
 winning these games because 
for one, you win the immunity. 
You don't have to go 
 through the brain rush 
of worrying about kicking 
 somebody off your team. 
STACEY: 
 In general, 
 we're a really tight group. 
We all have 
our individual strengths 
and we're pulling together. 
It's just, if we could 
 get Rudy out of here 
I think we'd be even stronger. 
It's going to 
 have to be rope,
not that little
 stuff we got. 
No, we got three rolls 
of the rope, Rudy. 
It's hanging there. 
Why don't you 
 just tie the rope?
( indistinct chatter ) 
How do you feel, 
Kell? 
I feel secure. 
Lookin' good! 
 Go, baby! 
Baby! 
World's record! 
( whooping ) 
"Island telegram. 
 "Stop! 
"Next challenge: 
 "Stop! 
"Choose the smallest member. 
 "Stop! 
"The lighter 
the better. 
 "Stop! 
"An emergency has come up. 
 "Stop. 
"Build sturdy, 
maneuverable stretcher. 
 "Stop! 
"Tribe's fate 
 may depend on it. 
Stop." 
Yeah! 
Right now, I am collecting stuff
 to build a, um... stretcher. 
For what, we don't know-- 
to carry our lightest member 
 and whatever else, 
and through something 
 or over something. 
I don't know. 
We have some idea. 
It's going to involve 
 the stretcher 
and an evacuation-- 
an emergency-type thing. 
We got to win, guys. 
We're feeling 
 a little bit defensive, 
but we're also feeling 
 like we can do it. 
We can beat them 'cause we got 
 a really light person 
and a really strong team 
 pulling her. 
It's not going 
 to be the most 
 comfortable ride
she's ever had. 
Everybody ready? 
Great! 
Whoo! 
Stop. Stop! 
Good job! 
Awesome. 
 Good job. 
Hey, guys. 
 Welcome to Larai Larai Beach. 
Another immunity challenge. 
You guys got a note 
 asking to build a stretcher. 
You were also asked 
 to pick one member. 
An hour ago, 
we took those two people 
and placed them in a secret 
 location in the jungle. 
This is an immunity challenge. 
You know what that means, 
but let me spell it out: 
The losers are going 
 to the Tribal Council 
where you have to vote off 
 another member. 
All right, for the scenario, 
 I just need one leader 
from each team 
 to come up here. 
I'll take that immunity idol. 
That's fair game again. 
For today's scenario, 
imagine there's 
 been a plane wreck-- 
this plane right here. 
On that plane was one 
 of your tribe members. 
The good news is they're okay. 
They had a parachute on. 
The bad news is, they are stuck 
up in this jungle, 
 hanging from a tree. 
Your job is to take 
 your stretcher, 
get up here to where they are 
 and get them back down. 
They are equal distance 
 from the beach, 
so everything is fair. 
Once you get back down here, 
it's a sprint from here 
all the way down 
 to our first aid tent. 
You have to have all six people 
with one hand on the stretcher. 
You guys ready? 
Survivors ready? 
This is for immunity. Go! 
Go, go, go! 
( screaming ): 
 Help! 
( Colleen screaming ) 
( cawing ) 
I'm right here! 
 I'm right here! 
You're so close! 
( Pagong man cawing ) 
Colleen, where are you at? 
( Colleen screaming ) 
( cawing ) 
Here, here! Get me down! 
All right, you guys. 
We so have this one. 
Stand on my shoulders. 
 All I can do 
is take this down... 
You got it? 
Almost. 
Are you loose? 
No! 
I need to go up more. 
Okay. 
You got it? 
Yeah. 
Are you loose? Let's go. 
Tagi, come on and help me! 
I'm dying up here! 
Come on, you guys! 
All right. 
Rich, I need you 
up here! 
Here we go.
 I'm here. 
Quick, get underneath her! 
Stand up tall! 
Good! She's down! 
You got to get me. 
Got her. 
 Get it off.
You guys have to carry me. 
Let's go. 
Take it. 
You got the flag? 
Yeah. 
If it gets in 
 the way, drop it. 
We got her, 
 we got her. 
Keep going, guys. 
We got this one. 
Hold on to me. 
Let's go! Go! 
Go! Go! 
Come on! 
Wait! No! 
( all shouting ) 
Come on! 
COLLEEN: 
You guys, we so won this! 
Lift it! 
JEFF: 
 There it is.
Nice job, guys. 
( Colleen whooping ) 
JEFF: 
 Tagi, Tribal 
 Council tonight.
I know that's going to
 be a tough decision 
who you guys are 
 going to vote off.
You got the afternoon 
 to think about it, 
and I'll see you at 
 the council tonight.
...all over 
my back. 
SUSAN: 
 We just got to get some fish 
to keep our strength up. 
Yeah. 
I don't want to 
 do this tonight.
This is the worst one. 
Yo, guys, the good news 
 about winning: 
We have a little victory walk 
 planned for you. 
I don't know if you've been 
 to Bird Island yet-- 
it is beautiful-- 
and there awaits, hanging 
in the tree like Colleen, 
your immunity idol. 
( singing in native language ) 
( singing continues ) 
MAN: 
Yeah, we got a walk-on tonight. 
STACEY: 
 Since we lost 
 the challenge today, 
we go back to the council 
 tonight-- fun, fun. 
Well, having lost the challenge,
we've got to vote 
 somebody out again. 
That's what happens every time 
we lose an immunity challenge. 
( whistling ) 
KELLY: 
 I don't think it's going 
 to get any easier. 
You know, 
 every time we go there, 
it's just going 
 to suck even more. 
STACEY: 
 We haven't been 
 in this council in six days, 
and in those six days, 
we've all gotten 
 to know each other pretty well,
and I feel bad 
 'cause I know they're all, 
you know, as scared 
about being, you know, 
 voted off as I am. 
I thought it was a done deal 
that Rudy would be the next one
 off, but it could be me. 
I don't know. 
It's either going to be me 
or Stacey, you know, 
 that get voted off. 
I think the younger people 
 are going to band together. 
They're going to get rid of me,
and then they got to 
 cutthroat each other. 
I'm going to vote Stacey out 
 at the council tonight 
'cause I don't like her 
and I never will. 
SUSAN: 
 I told Stacey 
 I was going to vote for Rudy. 
But I was thinking about 
 voting for her 
'cause she was the weakest. 
I got to think of the team; 
 that's what I come here for. 
RICHARD: 
 I've kind of prioritized people
based on who's contributing, 
 I think, 
and can contribute most 
 to the competitions. 
I even wanted 
 to talk with the group 
about who we were voting for 
and let's, you know, 
 before we even go, know, 
so we could talk 
 with the people, but... 
boy, did that not fly. 
( thunderclap ) 
KELLY: 
 I don't think anybody's 
 out here to make friends. 
I'm not out here 
 to make friends. 
People that you're forming 
 alliances with now, 
and the people that 
 you're getting along with now 
are the people 
 that are going to have 
to turn around and vote you, 
 but somebody's got to go. 
So, it's just the way it goes. 
( thunderclap ) 
( gong ringing ) 
Go ahead and place your torches 
 in their slots behind you. 
Take a seat. 
I thought about
 you earlier, 
making the long 
 walk from your camp
to the middle of the jungle, 
to Tribal Council 
 on what has been 
one of the weirdest weather days
 we've had so far. 
20 minutes ago, 
 it was as hot 
 as it's ever been 
and now we have
 as big a storm 
 as we've seen. 
Going to try a couple of things 
 differently tonight. 
One is this conch shell-- 
the whole idea being 
 to see if we can get 
to a little 
 more truth. 
You ought to be 
 able to feel safe,
to say things here 
 that maybe you can't
 say back at camp. 
So, is there anybody here that
 has something on their mind? 
Have at it,
 Richard. 
Keep me. I'm 
 getting the fish. 
( laughs ) 
I'm bringing in the fish; 
 don't vote me out. 
JEFF: 
 Fair enough.
Sean, you and 
 Dirk went out,
tried to catch fish
 for a few days. 
Went out again today. 
Went out 
 again today.
Do you feel, even though 
you're putting forth the effort,
do you feel a bit threatened 
 by the fact that 
when it comes 
 to assessing people's worth, 
Richard did deliver 
 and you haven't 
been able to 
 catch any fish,
or is that just
 one aspect? 
No, I don't think so 
right now, at this point, 
but I think that Richard 
 catching fish 
is great for the group, 
and I'm pretty comfortable 
with my position. 
I'm somewhat entertaining, 
sometimes. 
I make people laugh, 
and I'm keeping people healthy 
and, uh, so I'm comfortable 
 with my role-- 
fishless or fishworthy. 
Susan, you've been 
quiet tonight. 
What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking right now that, 
 um, the elimination... 
the way we vote is 
because of the... competition-- 
it's like Rich getting fish 
 for the group. 
That's not coming 
 into foreplay yet 
'cause we're not starving 
 to death yet. 
Maybe by day 20, we'll be, like,
yeah, he can catch fish, 
he's staying
 around, 
you know, but, uh... 
All right, it's raining too hard
to put you guys through this 
 any longer. 
Anybody want to 
 say anything at all
 in this downpour? 
Stacey, the 
 floor is yours.
Yeah, you guys, 
I daresay I was happy 
 to eat the bugs 
that kept us out of here 
last time, 
and the games coming up are 
my real strong point, so... 
JEFF: 
 All right, guys.
You got to 
 survive the vote
to keep going on. 
So, Sean, start us off. 
It's going to be a downpour, 
 buddy. Write clearly. 
I'm voting for Stacey. 
Um, nothing personal. 
I just feel that we need 
 as much athleticism 
and brute force 
 in this competition. 
I love her to death 
and this is no reflection 
 on the type of person she is. 
Rudy. 
I'll make this quick, guys. 
I'll tally the votes. 
Once the votes
 are tallied, 
the decision
 is final, 
and the person
 voted off 
will need to 
 leave the island
 immediately. 
The good news is, 
you'll soon be drier. 
With that, I will, uh... 
read the names. 
First vote... 
"Stacey." 
Next vote, fading, 
"Rudy." 
"Stacey." 
"Rudy." 
That's two 
 votes for Rudy,
two votes 
 for Stacey.
"Stacey." 
"Stacey." 
That's four 
 votes, Stacey.
That's a majority. 
We don't need to 
 read the last one.
STACEY: 
 All right, 
 you switched your vote. 
JEFF: 
 You need to bring 
 me your torch 
if you would, please. 
 Thank you. 
Thanks. 
Well, the weather 
 has spoken 
and the tribe 
 has spoken. 
Okay. 
It's time for you to go. 
This way? 
 Yeah. 
All right.
 Good-bye. 
As for you guys, 
I don't want to send 
 you back out in that. 
You're welcome 
 to stay here tonight, 
or until it stops raining... 
as dry as you can, 
and, uh, I'll see you 
 at some point tomorrow. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
( singing in native language ) 
Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode. 
Next week on Survivor: 
Last night was the worst night 
 I've ever slept. 
I don't want to sleep 
 in that anymore. 
I'm going in the woods. 
I had this vision. 
I thought I'd build 
 myself a bowling alley. 
We don't need a bowling alley. 
RICHARD: 
 I know what the resolution 
to the conflict would be, but 
 I'm planning something 
 different 
and it's a little sneaky. 
They kicked off 
 their bug-eating hero 
instead of their 
 food-stealing 
stumbling, 
 ornery old Navy Seal. 
Probably the guys said, "Well, 
 we need to vote a woman off 
"'cause we need 
 physical strength, 
and, you know, who do we think 
 is the least productive?" 
And that would be me. 
And yet I was much more 
productive than the four guys.
