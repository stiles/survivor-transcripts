         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans 
 forced to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Marooned for 39 days, 
 they must work together 
to build shelter, 
find food and survive 
 the island, 
but ultimately, 
 it is everyone for themselves. 
Every third night 
they will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council 
where they must vote 
 one of their own 
off the island. 








In the end, 
 only one will remain 
and will leave the island 
with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 
The merge 
 was on everyone's mind 
as the two tribes 
 prepared to become one. 
We do got the merge coming. 
( growling ) 
JEFF: 
 At Tagi, Rich was flexing 
his voting alliance muscles. 
RICHARD: 
 I am in control 
of who's being voted off 
and I think that's all 
 that matters to me. 
JEFF: 
 And Sue was deciding 








who on Pagong 
 should be voted off 
after the merge. 
Greg, definitely--
 he's just way 
too psychotic. 
JEFF: 
 At Pagong, 
 Gervase made a comment 
that upset 
 his female tribe mates. 
Girls are the stupidest things 
 on the planet next to cows. 
Oh! He called us "stupid." 
Go!
JEFF: 
 The immunity challenge became 
 more competitive than ever 
because if Pagong won, 
they would enter the merge 
 with six members 
to Tagi's four, giving them 
 a voting advantage. 
Yeah, you guys! 
JEFF: 
 But Tagi won, 
insuring them that the tribes 
 would merge 
at five members each. 
The loss sent Pagong 
back to Tribal Council 
 where Greg joined the women 
in voting Joel off the island. 
On the eve of the merge, 
 ten are left. 
Who will be the first voted out
 of the newly formed tribe? 
( chanting ) 
JEFF: 
 Day 19. 
Survivor has reached 
 a turning point. 
Very soon, the ten remaining 
members of Tagi and Pagong 
will form one new tribe. 
They will live together 
 but they will now compete 
against each other 
 individually. 
There are many questions 
 to be answered: 
Where will they live? 
What will this new tribe 
 call themselves? 
What kind of world 
 will they now create? 
To begin the process, 
 an ambassador from each tribe--
Jenna from Pagong 
 and Sean from Tagi-- 
will assess the livability 
 of each other's camp. 
They will then paddle out 
 to the sand spit for a summit 
where they will negotiate 
 and decide 
on which of the two beaches 
this new tribe of ten 
 will live. 
Their decision will be final. 
Sean is being guided 
 to Pagong Beach by Greg, 
and Jenna is being guided 
 to Tagi by Kelly. 
This is the first time 
 either ambassador 
has seen the opposing tribe's 
 camp. 
Our camp's way better 
 than theirs 
just from talking to them. 
They don't have 
a living room with benches, 
never mind a decent kitchen. 
I think our house is better 
from what they've described. 
We have fish. 
Gretchen and I both fished 
 for an hour. 
Really? 
Nothing. Not even a bite. 
When do you guys fish? 
Early morning, late evening. 
Yeah, that's when we fish. 
But, you know, 
 we got the gay guy... 
gay compassionate guy. 
He's, like, middle-of-the-road. 
And you got Sue 
who says whatever 
the hell's on her mind. 
SUSAN: 
 As far as somebody coming here 
from Pagong today, 
 it's going to be fun. 
We like having company 
 over at camp, 
even though we don't have 
 a whole lot to offer for lunch.
I'm hoping... 
 I think the kicker of it all 
will be if Rich gets fish 
and we have fish for lunch. 
I think they'll be here. 
And Rich... Rich
 is a sweetheart.
So easygoing. 
He's naked a lot. 
Um... okay. 
I'm excited about it being 
 a big group, because right now 
there's not a lot 
 of personalities going on 
and it's quiet 
and we've seen every inch 
 of this little place here, 
and I'm excited 
 to meet new people, 
and even if it's some good, 
 some bad, 
or whatever, 
at least, it's something. 
It's a mix and so it'll be 
 more interesting 
than it is right now. 
Oh, good, 
 they sent the doctor. 
Hi. How are you? 
I'm fine. 
Nice to see you. 
 Nice to see you.
What's going on, man? 
How do you feel?
Good. How about you? 
 Nice to see you, man. 
You want a tour?
Yeah, let me have a tour. 
 Take me around. 
Hi, Sue. 
 How are you?
Good. 
Beautiful... 
 The sun's out. 
Stingray, cuttlefish 
and lobster for lunch. 
( squeals )
We're having rock lobster 
 for lunch. 
Oh, my God. 
 Hey, Kel, check out
 the cuttlefish. 
Deluxe. 
 Nice, nice. 
Oh, yeah. 
 With a working lid 
 and everything. 
Wi-with lid. 
 Uh-huh. 
How often do you
 guys move that? 
Never? 
 Never. 
This is, uh, 
 chef Rudy. 
Check out 
the kitchen. 
Chef Rudy, um, can I
 go in your kitchen? 
Okay. 
 Oh, yeah. 
Wipe your feet.
"Rowdy Rudy's Diner" 
This is where we keep spices, 
toilet paper, candles... 
fruit peels 
 go in there.
Nice. 
But, uh... 
 This is so nice. 
RICHARD: 
Isn't that a cool kitchen? 
So, see, now, 
these are our kitchen hammocks. 
 Damn! 
Oh, yeah, sleep five 
 really comfortable. 
Ours is about 
the same size, 
but it's lifted a little higher 
in the back. 
And, uh, right 
 now, we've just...
we got two 
 mosquito nets.
The guys go
 on the left
and me and Sue and
 Rich, the girls, 
 go on the right. 
Go ahead and pull out... 
Yeah, we have 
this thing... 
If you want, 
I'll diagram what we got. 
Nice. 
Super bench, 
 living room area. 
Oh, my God, 
 you guys are 
very, very 
well-organized. 
( laughing )
So much more than ours. 
Have a seat. 
Hey, not too bad. 
We got plenty 
of this, too. 
We don't eat 
that much of it. 
No?
No. We have it. 
We don't eat it. 
GERVASE: 
 We live off
 this stuff.
It's a lot of work 
for a little bit of sugar 
it seems to me, 
you know? 
You guys are amazing. 
Like a well- 
 oiled machine.
The stingray 
 looks wonderful.
KELLY: 
 Stingray is so good. 
Stingray is incredible. 
Does it 
grab you? 
Whoa. 
Is it funkified 
already? 
Fermented? 
That's not good. 
Next. 
 Number two.
SUSAN: 
You know, you kind of get... 
Ah, there's a lot of meat 
on that bad boy. 
Yeah, just try that.
SUSAN: 
Yeah. 
Oh, my God. 
SUSAN: 
Isn't it good? 
It's delicious. 
I don't need anymore, 
you know. 
You know... 
I mean, uh... 
Right off, just chew 
on the cuttlebone. 
Hey, you know... 
RICHARD: 
 It's calamari. 
It's going to be 
 just like squid. 
It's the exact same thing. 
If you've had fried calamari, 
That's awesome. 
 well, we're having roasted. 
Here. 
RICHARD: 
 That lobster, it's so sweet. 
This is delicious. 
( laughing )
That's what we 
 want you to say 
 when you get home.
Just tell them
how good 
 everything is.
Food, golden. 
Yeah, when we merge tonight, 
 I think it'll be interesting. 
I think, uh, it'll set up 
 a whole nother set 
of interpersonal dynamics 
that'll be fun for me to watch. 
Tell us more, uh, like, 
 rumors you've heard about us, 
or things you think you know 
 about us... 
 Okay. 
or what do you want to know 
 about us? 
All right, um, let's see-- 
"rumors that I've heard"-- 
that you guys are plotting 
an alliance against us... 
divide and conquer 
 sort of thing. 
Really? 
 That's the big one. 
The alliance 
 that we have going on 
is Rich, Rudy, Kelly and me. 
We'll vote four people strong, 
and if we can make it 
 through the first two votes, 
getting somebody 
 off of their team off... 
( chuckles ) 
we should be able to slide 
 into home plate. 
That's what we said.
 Yeah, you only get... 
We don't know any of you; 
 you don't know any of us. 
Exactly, 
 and I'm so excited 
to get to know 
 five new people. 
( laughing ): 
 So are we. 
Cool. 
Jenna's sincere. 
She is sincere. 
I believe 
Jenna's sincere, 
and I think 
Gretchen's sincere, 
but Gren... 
Jenna is young, and not 
a mature young
 like you. 
She's young.
Just babbling. 
 She's young flaky. 
JENNA: 
 I wanted to come across
 as a strong young mom 
'cause I think
they're often portrayed 
as victims of circumstance, 
and, uh... 
 wanted to be a good role model 
for my girls when they see it 
 when they get older. 
She wants to be proud 
 for her children. 
Proud for your children-- 
 win. 
She's just really 
 happy to be here. 
Show your girls what it's about 
 and how to win. 
Six days ago, I was 180 out, 
but, uh, I seen the light. 
It's... ( chuckles ) 
If you want to win this money, 
 you got to get a little dirty. 
You know, who's next, 
don't you? 
I don't need to 
 deal with that. 
 Who, after Greg?
Jenna. 
Jenna. 
I was thinking Sean. 
Oh, yeah. 
He's too much 
competition 
and he will not 
participate. 
The reason Sean's not 
 in the alliance 
because... Sean... 
is dumb. 
So, Sean, are they,
 uh, planning on 
 banding together 
and picking us 
 off one by one?
SEAN: 
I think they've changed 
their minds, you know, because 
I think they have 
very nice, warm 
touchy feelings 
towards you guys. 
Sean's ethically against 
 any kind of alliance 
and I hear Gretchen is similar 
 on the other side 
and, um... I don't get it. 
You know, I-I consider myself 
extraordinarily ethical 
 and moral 
and, uh, this has 
absolutely nothing to do 
 with this. 
Uh, it sounds like 
 sheer stupidity to me 
when somebody says 
"Oh, no, I'm not going 
 to build an alliance, 
and I hope they wouldn't 
 do that either." 
Uh, you know, I giggle 
 and think, "okay." 
( laughing ) 
God, I'm glad I'm 
 on your team. 
Yeah, baby. 
Didn't come 
 here to... 
make friends. 
I got to lug 
 one of you guys? 
GERVASE: 
 Sean's cool. 
 Sean's a nice guy. 
He had a lot of stories 
 to tell, and... 
I mean, he... he was just, 
 like, a genuine, honest guy-- 
you know, what he said, 
you just believed what he said. 
You can just tell 
 he wants to have some fun. 
He hasn't had fun yet, 
 so, uh... 
we'll bring lots of fun his way.
We'll keep him entertained. 
( both talking at once ) 
I will. 
Bye, Rich. Bye, Rudy. 
RUDY: 
 Jenna and Sean are going 
 to have a good time talking. 
I don't know which one 
 talks the most. 
She ain't shut up 
 since she's been here. 
Bye, guys. 
Bye, girl. 
Bye, Sean! 
JEFF: 
 Welcome, Jenna. 
A chair just for you. 
Welcome. 
 And look at me--
 I didn't dress 
 for dinner. 
How you doing? 
 Nice to see you.
Nice to see you. 
One chair for you. 
 Hello. How are you?
Wow, we're off 
 to a good start. 
A little kiss-- 
 I like that. 
Pretty cool. 
Well, here's the deal: 
You guys are ambassadors 
 for your tribes. 
You have a very important task 
 tonight. 
We wanted you to 
 feel like ambassadors,
 so we've prepared 
some lobster, 
 you have some bread, 
baked potatoes, 
butter for the lobster,
uh, lemon-- I don't think 
we missed anything 
 except for the wine 
which is being chilled 
 right now. 
What I need 
in the morning is 
on this parchment, with 
 a couple of pens in here, 
to have the new name 
 of the tribe... 
which camp 
 you're going to be at, 
and the three items 
 you're taking. 
You'll be given one new color 
for this new tribe-- 
green-- yellow and 
 orange no longer used 
to represent opposing tribes. 
You are now one. 
There's also stuff 
to make two new flags for camp. 
There are paintbrushes, paints, 
so once you decide on the name, 
 you can go to town on that. 
Can we eat first? 
You can do... 
 you have all night. 
As you can see... right here, 
 we have two beds. 
( laughing )
Oh, my God. 
So we are definitely 
staying here tonight? 
You are here all night.
Jenna, how stylin' are we! 
I immediately saw the table 
 set up with... 
it was like a romantic dinner. 
It was like this table all set 
 up with everything, two beds 
off to the right 
single, like, 
 really nice sheets 
and pillows and blankets, 
 and, uh... 
like, a stump, 
we had a bedside table, 
we had lanterns everywhere, 
 tiki torches, 
and the first thing 
 I thought was... 
"Oh, man, 
they're so setting this up 
for it to be romantic with Sean"
and there's just... 
there's not a spark there. 
Making out's, I think, 
first base; 
second base, up the shirt; 
third base... 
 Okay, okay. 
But I often give a bad first 
 impression sometimes. 
You never heard 
of bases like that? 
I always just knew 
 what the home run was.
I'm all about the goal.
I'm goal-oriented.
Sliding into home plate 
here's Jenna. 
 Okay. 
They wanted it to be 
 more romantic 
than it was ever going to be, 
 but, uh... 
from either end of us, 
 but we really had 
an exceptional time, 
 and we tied one on, you know, 
uh, finished the bottles 
 of wine, 
and we ate like 
 kings and queens, 
and, uh, it was fantastic. 
Uh, we saw Pagong's fire 
 was still lit 
so I was like, 
"Oh, I want to call home. 
They're probably worried." 
And, uh, so we threw 
a bunch of kerosene on our fire 
to make it whoosh, 
and they said they saw that, 
so I hoped 
 that they would figure 
that I was still there, 
 that I was okay. 
Whoa. Fire 
on the spit. 
It seems so far away
 from the island. 
GREG: 
 They had to have fed Jenna. 
I mean, the summit going 
from 4:00 in the afternoon 
until... well after dark... 
Yeah. They're not going
 to let her starve. 
With one lunch. 
Well, Gervase can save hers 
 in case... his 
in case she... wants to see 
 what it would have been like. 
JENNA: 
 We talked all night. 
It helped that they had 
 four bottles of wine there. 
So we drank them all 
and, uh, we were both 
 pretty drunk. 
And... it's raining, 
 and we're inside now. 
We just made it. 
 We're completely
 covered. 
We had a great meal.
Me, I'm exhausted from 
all this wine. 
Do you want to go to bed? 
GRETCHEN: 
 We're just waiting 
 'cause no one's given us 
any information. 
So, I mean, last night 
we were wondering where she was.
And then somebody said 
"Well, she can't come back 
until the negotiations 
 are over." 
But there's really nothing 
 to negotiate. 
We could have made a shelter 
in that time. 
 We could have made-- 
whatever they're 
 negotiating for, 
we could have moved 
 our whole camp-- 
been done in that time. 
So I don't, I don't know what 
 the whole process is about. 
We miss Jenna. 
We haven't seen Jenna at all 
since she's left, 
and we were kind of worried 
 about her last night 
when it got dark 
 and she wasn't here. 
GREG: 
 I'd be wasting 
 my time and energy 
to, uh, guess what's happening.
So I don't even bother. 
What's going on? 
It's a beautiful day. 
The sun's nice. 
You can see Mount Kinabalu 
and, uh, 
we're going to go fishing. 
RUDY: 
 That's a big one. 
RICHARD: 
Yeah, he's a good fatty. 
That's a lot of meat. 
They talked about some kind 
 of a negotiation, 
and I would imagine if the two 
parties had opposing views 
as to what camp 
 they should move to 
that the negotiation 
 might go on-- 
or might be interesting. 
But since both parties, 
as far as we know, 
 want to move to this camp, 
I can't imagine what's going on 
 on the sand spit. 
SUSAN: 
 We're not sure yet, 
 because Sean has been gone 
almost 24 hours now 
 since we sent him off 
on the messenger thing. 
So the anticipation 
 of waiting for Sean 
is just actually starting 
 to drive us wild. 
Oh, my God!
I have so much 
 to tell you guys. 
First things first--
we are moving.
We have five minutes
 from when we banked 
to get everything in
 your backpacks-- 
to get your luxury item.
Only what you brought 
 in your backpacks 
and luxury item-- 
and three objects,
 which we chose, 
and we're out of here.
And we told Pagong 
 the unfortunate news 
that they had five minutes 
 to pack their things-- 
get their luxury item 
 and choose three items. 
Which we decided were the wool 
 blanket that they have, 
the mosquito netting, 
so we could sleep 
under the mosquito netting, 
and the, um, cooking pot. 
We were given 
a luxury dinner, 
but we had to decide 
a new name 
and we had to paint 
the new flag, 
and we had to pick
 a location-- 
she liked 
our camp a lot. 
You guys will love it.
Actually, Sean let me do 
 almost all of the deciding. 
I came up with the name, 
 he added an "a" on the end. 
Jenna came up with the name. 
It had to be something that 
 was indigenous to the island 
and, you know, we have a lot 
 of rattan wood here. 
And we just added an "a" 
to make it sound more exotic. 
That was my idea. 
You know, give it a little 
 flair, a little pizzazz. 
JENNA: 
 As we were dining 
 on lobster and, um... 
baked potatoes.
SEAN: 
Dessert. 
JENNA: 
Four bottles of wine. 
SEAN: 
Four bottles of wine. 
Four bottles of wine. 
A hangover 
 in the morning. 
A hangover, a bed... 
Beds, a tent. 
GREG: 
 You know, they come back 
having had a great night 
and "oh, my God, I can't wait 
 to tell you guys 
how much we've eaten." 
And that's wonderful. 
That's how ambassadors 
 should be treated. 
But, you know, of course, 
when you're on an island 
surviving on white rice 
and the occasional fish... 
SEAN: 
 Four croissants 
 with orange marmalade 
and strawberry jam. 
Coffee... four bottles. 
Hey, tell me a little bit 
 more about it. 
I'd love to hear 
 about butter sauce. 
Like... thanks. 
GERVASE: 
 I mean, 
 it just makes more sense 
to go to their side. 
I mean, I think that's what 
 everybody wanted to do anyway. 
Everybody wanted to get out 
 of this section 
just for a new change 
 of scenery. 
We've been here for 20 days. 
We've seen it. We know it. 
So it was just like, 
you know, 
 let's try something new. 
COLLEEN: 
 Sean was even saying there's 
 enough room for us in the hutch
because enough people 
 sleep outside, so... 
It's going to go quick. 
God, I hope it goes quick from 
 here on out, you know. Really. 
When I first got here, 
 I... you know, 
I think maybe I would have been 
 more comfortable 
on the other team, 
 because I, you know, 
from what I understand, 
they pulled their camp together,
they got their stuff 
 hanging up, 
which is, like, something 
that's been bothering me 
since the day we got here, 
 and... 
but I think it was good for me 
 to be with this tribe 
because, um, you don't have 
 to work all the time 
and you don't have 
 to be busting butt. 
It's nice... you know, 
we're healthy and we're happy 
and we spend a lot 
 of time having fun. 
So I think it taught 
 me something, too. 
You can be very comfortable 
and I don't feel like I need 
to bust butt all the time, 
and I've had a good time 
 while I'm here. 
So I'll be glad to go 
 with the other tribe 
and I was glad to be 
 with this tribe. 
GREG: 
 It's like starting over. 
We've left behind 
a lot of things-- 
 a lot of material possessions. 
Metaphysically, we've also 
 left behind 
a lot of emotional issues. 
Um... there was 
 a lot of baggage 
that we left on that... 
 on that Pagong Beach. 
But, uh...
we're moving on 
 to bigger and better things. 
I'm excited. 
I did feel sadness 
 when we left Pagong. 
Looking back, that was where 
we rode to the first day 
when we were shipwrecked. 
It was where I'd formed a bond 
 with eight... 
seven other people, so... 
it was sad. 
But it was a new beginning 
 for me-- a whole nother tribe. 
Are we close to Tagi? 
I don't think that's 
what it's called anymore. 
It's Rattana. 
( laughing and talking ) 
Come on, left side. 
Come on, left side.
God, it's 
beautiful. 
Yeah, it really is.
COLLEEN: 
 So Rich came out, 
 it was like 
"Hey, how are you?" 
You know, he swam out, 
 which was really nice. 
They welcomed us 
 with open arms. 
We got along really well. 
Welcome.
Ooh! 
So, what they 
 were really doing was coming 
to the beach 
 and, uh, were moving in 
with what things 
 they could have gotten together
in the five minutes 
 that they had 
to get together, I guess. 
I was glad to see that. 
Hi. Nice 
to see you again. 
Can I get a hug, 
all right? 
You, too, handsome.
Were you guys 
worried about me? 
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
Clothesline.
House.
Living room.
Kitchen.
Bathroom. 
Oh, my. 
The house ain't done yet. 
We can't tour 
 the house yet, no. 
GREG: 
 A boy named Sue. 
Strong, loud, with an accent 
that'll drive you 
 up the wall! 
Was he talking about me? 
Yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. 
Oh, come on! 
I'm up. 
Remind me 
to do it. 
Yeah, you had 
a good one. 
This thing's 
about 300 years old. 
I think Rudy's 
 very set in his ways, 
so having, you know, 
five new people move in, 
 it scared him a lot, 
so he was just sitting back 
and he was assessing 
 the situation, I think. 
All of a sudden, 
we doubled our population. 
Uh, the house got smaller, 
the pots got smaller, 
and, uh... 
personally, 
 it's a pain in the ass. 
New people, 
new scene... 
new things 
to talk about, 
you know. 
( general conversation ) 
KELLY: 
 It's almost too good. 
Like, everybody's too... 
"Oh, you go first." 
"No, you go first," 
oh, you know, everybody's 
being real, real super polite, 
 you know, which is cool. 
COLLEEN: 
 Sean is very intelligent. 
Sometimes he says 
 interesting things. 
Sometimes you tune out 
for a while, 
 and then he hits on something 
so you tune back in, you know. 
I mean, he's always going. 
SEAN: 
Girls always rank 
"sense of humor" 
then, like, "ambition" 
 and then all this other stuff 
and then rank "looks," 
like, number five or six. 
But meanwhile, 
I know so many 
unambitious, 
good-looking guys, 
who have absolutely 
no personality, 
that still get 
a lot of girls. 
I'm really going
 to get skinny. 
I got to go back 
 in the water. Bye.
GREG: 
 Rich is clever 
 and, uh... I mean 
we'll start being honest now. 
I think Rich thinks 
 he's very clever. 
He is, uh, relatively sharp, 
 and, uh... 
he has a lot of things going on
 in his mind that he, uh... 
selectively decides, uh, 
 what he will share 
and with whom. 
Rich is playing a big game, 
which is very fun, 
 so he's awfully entertaining. 
KELLY: 
 That... it was suggested... 
that we should, you know, 
"beef up" the supports 
 and everything. 
Okay, which, you know, 
 I don't know 
I don't know anything 
 about shingles and roofing, 
and I just know 
 how to tie knots, 
that's pretty much 
 all I know how to do. 
Okay. 
It ain't going
 nowhere. 
You might want 
to tie this. 
Ow! 
Up and down.
( loud crashing ) 
That doesn't sound good. 
Oh, yeah. 
( hearty laughter ) 
I didn't 
 touch it. 
 Oh, my God! 
That did not 
just happen. 
Oh, my God. 
And, bam, shingles break, 
the whole roof 
 comes crashing down. 
Felt like such an idiot. 
It figures that the day 
 that everyone shows up 
the whole roof caves in 
 while they're repairing it. 
Yeah, it's the same as it is 
 back home, ladies, 
here in the jungle. 
The women are doing all the work
and the guys 
 are just hanging out 
and b.s.'ing, yeah. 
It's my turn. 
I pick up 
 from here.
It's a hit. 
I can hit you this card; 
you can't drop. 
Every time you get hit 
you have to stay around 
one more round. 
( gasping )
Very good, Rich.
( chuckles ) 
The guys are kind of bumming 
around, but I think that's good 
'cause I think all the guys 
 got to get to know each other. 
RICHARD: 
 Isn't that beautiful? 
Don't lie. 
It looks like mucus, 
doesn't it? 
SUSAN: 
Oh, yeah. 
Jammin'. 
You see it, Sue?
You see anything? 
( laughing )
It's how men and women relate, 
 you know. 
The women-- we work together 
and we... it's a little... 
 women are always 
a little bit competitive 
 in everything we do, you know, 
so it's like 
 when you're working together 
you're seeing 
 what the other person 
can do, and you're proving 
 each other at the same time. 
Men can sit down 
 and talk for hours 
and walk away friends. 
You got the hang
 of it now. 
( hearty chuckle ) 
Gervase was great. 
I beat the hell out of him 
in a number of games 
 that I've never played before, 
and he's, uh, 
 he's good at cards. 
I think he could have been 
 letting me win. 
Uh, who knows? 
He could be playing the odds, 
 too. 
It's natural to me. 
What I do, I don't think 
 I'm doing anything special. 
I'm just being myself. 
But other people always say, 
like, "You're a charmer." 
"You're a smooth talker." 
Looking real good 
 there, Rich. 
Thanks. 
 Real good there.
Can you tell 
I'm losing? 
 Yeah. 
That makes me happy, 
'cause I can't tell. 
They don't... 
they don't 
 cook out enough.
They're... they're great 
 for bait 
but their insides 
is just nothing but guts. 
Greg's an interesting character.
He's young, too. 
 He's 24, 
and he was pretty cocky. 
He was thinking he could go out
 and get something, came back in
with a sea urchin. 
( derisive chuckling ) 
But that was good, 
 that shows people 
that he who thought 
 he was a spear-fishing person 
could go out there, 
 no problem, 
comes from the other tribe 
and came back in, 
 telling everybody 
just how difficult it is-- 
 that ups my value even more. 
JENNA: 
 Free in sight, 
 less than 100 feet away 
and we have, like... 
I've got this girl laid out in, 
like, across the back seat 
of, like, a Suzuki Sidekick 
 and it was, like, incredible. 
Come on. Who can
 follow that? 
Not I. 
 Rich. 
Rich can. 
 Rich, yay. 
First night as one tribe 
 we sat around the campfire, 
told stories-- very, very, very 
 revealing stories. 
KELLY: 
 Gretchen said she drank a fifth
 of whiskey in two minutes 
when she was 14 
and I would have never guessed 
that about her, you know? 
Sounds like we kind of have 
 a similar past. 
This new group is, like, 
 it's like a banquet. 
It's like a banquet of stories 
 and excitement. 
Sean left 
an orgy opportunity. 
No, I left a two-on-one 
opportunity. Two girls. 
How come you
 left it? 
I was scared 
out of my mind. 
RUDY: 
 Some of the stuff they talk 
 about don't interest me 
and I don't want to hear it. 
I don't know. 
They talk about a lot 
 of sex stuff. 
( thunder crashing ) 
( rain pouring ) 
Wait, Rudy.
You're going to be
 good over there. 
GRETCHEN: 
 Keep your hands to yourself. 
RUDY: 
 Everybody's hands 
 all over me. 
Damn, Rudy. 
GRETCHEN: 
 It rained again last night 
and we had to rebuild the roof 
of their shelter yesterday 
and I think half of it 
 is leakproof 
and half of it 
 doesn't have a roof, 
and so a lot of us 
 got very wet. 
And it's frustrating because we
 had just moved from a shelter 
that we had worked out 
 all the bugs in 
and kept us 90% dry. 
RUDY: 
 I was in there last night 
 and, uh, when the rain came 
all them women 
 eased down our way 
and I had about five women 
in my lap all of a sudden. 
Rudy was kicking me in the head.
 He doesn't care. 
JENNA: 
 Oh, yeah, people were getting 
kicked in the head 
 all night long 
because he got out three times 
and he would just barrel 
 through people. 
RUDY: 
 I mean, the pillows were 
 right across me, 
and I had to get up 
 and go to the head 
and I couldn't. 
I don't know. 
Rudy kicked me in the head, 
 like, three times last night 
and I said, 
 "Rudy, that's my head," 
and he said, "This is 
 my space, so..." 
I said, "Rudy, 
that's my head." 
He goes, "That's my spot." 
"I got to get out.
 It's my spot." 
That's what he said. 
Did you ask him 
 to draw the outlines? 
Hey, I'm the old guy, 
 don't forget. 
Them young guys 
 might have liked it. 
It's a pain in the ass to me. 
You do the honors. 
No, no, it's
 yours now. 
( both laugh ) 
Hey! I guess it's 
 not in there 
but this is
 different. 
"The next challenge, 
things couldn't be more fair. 
"Just take a deep breath 
and don't come up for air. 
"Immunity's the same 
except for this one note. 
"Now only one will be safe 
while the rest of you 
 face the vote." 
I'm guessing 
it's a "holding 
your breath" competition. 
Welcome to Snake Island. 
Congratulations on surviving 
 the first phase. 
You guys have now all proven 
that you can definitely 
 survive the island. 
I don't think 
 that's in question. 
You've been here three weeks; 
 everybody's doing great. 
Now it's going to be about 
 who can survive each other. 
How well you guys survive 
 tribal politics. 
We've replaced the immunity idol
with an immunity talisman, 
so you will wear this 
 around your neck. 
That means that 
 at Tribal Council 
you cannot have any votes 
 cast against you. 
You will not be voted off. 
You can, however, vote 
 against others still, 
so it's a great place to be. 
This will go in the archives, 
this becomes the treasured icon.
This is our first immunity 
challenge as individuals. 
It's very simple. 
It's about holding your breath. 
In the first round, all ten 
 of you will go under the water 
to hold your breath. 
You'll each hold 
 onto a bar that will 
help keep you submerged. 
The last three to surface 
go on to the final round. 
Make sense? 
Head on in. 
( laughing ) 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
( laughs ) 
( laughing ) 
Come up for air. 
Good job, Sue. 
 Yeah, good job, Sue.
I guess I had to come up. 
( clock's second hand ticking ) 
Yeah. 
Yay!
Is he dead?
Everybody's up.
Come on, Gervase. 
He doesn't know 
if he should come up or not. 
ALL: 
 Yay! 
All right, 
Gervase! 
Sean, Gervase, Greg, 
 you guys are moving on. 
The rest of you guys 
 can sit up here 
on the dock with me 
 and take a break. 
JEFF: 
 Final round, this is it. 
Still about 
 holding your breath, 
but now we're adding speed. 
We're going to swim out 
 to a buoy. 
At the bottom 
 of the ocean floor 
are three ladders, 
 one for each of you. 
You're going to use the ladders
 to get momentum, 
and along the way are buoys. 
Yank hard, release the buoy. 
First person 
 to the end of the course 
that's released 
all their buoys gets immunity. 
Very simple. 
Use the ladder, 
 it's much quicker.
All right? 
Head out to 
 your buoys. 
I'll give you a start. 
Good luck. 
Gervase! Greg! Sean! 
This is for immunity-- 
the first individual immunity. 
Win this, 
 you cannot be voted off. 
Survivors ready!
Go! 
Gervase!
Close! Very close, Greg!
( cheering ) 
You all right, Gervase? 
Never swam like that 
 in my life, man. 
Towards the very end, he 
 was a smidgen ahead of me,
and no matter 
what I did, 
we were right 
 at each other. 
Feel like Miss America? 
It's all you, man,
 it's all you. 
RICHARD: 
 But even though we aren't 
 any longer two different teams,
I still have a team. 
It's going to be interesting 
 because we're not solid. 
We're solid with one another, 
but we're not 
 solidly unbeatable yet 
just by circumstance, because 
 there are only four of us 
and there are ten people 
 still left on the island. 
KELLY: 
 When you get 
 in that Tribal Council 
and you walk up and you see 
 that little piece of paper 
and the thing that you 
 put the vote in-- 
it's all different. 
You know, you might... 
 you might have a thought 
and say, "Hey, I really don't 
 want to vote this person off." 
It's easier said than done. 
An alliance 
 is easier said than done. 
GREG: 
 If people are fear- 
 and self-preservation-motivated
they'll band together, 
 they'll form alliances, 
they'll start 
 beating people out 
to try and get rid 
 of the strong ones 
and get rid of this 
 and get rid of that, 
and, uh, you know, 
 if that happens 
I hope they vote me off 
 really soon 
because, uh, that to me is-- 
whoa, cool flying fish-- 
that to me is really boring. 
JENNA: 
 Coming into this merger, I 
 consider it a brand-new tribe. 
I want a vote 
 based on people's merits. 
I don't want a vote based on 
"Let's get rid 
 of each of them first 
and then 
 come back to our tribe." 
I... I want a vote based on, uh,
 who I really think should go, 
whether it be a member of our 
 tribe or a member of theirs. 
All right, welcome to 
your first, uh, Tribal
 Council as Rattana. 
Doesn't change
 the rules. 
Doesn't change
 anything here.
This is still 
 where you account 
 for your actions, 
good or bad,
and, uh, by the 
 end of the night
one of you will be 
 voted off the island. 
So let's talk 
 about the actions 
of the past
 few days. 
Been a busy few days
 with the merger. 
Richard, with the 
 rules changing 
how has that changed 
 the group dynamic? 
You know, 
 I really haven't noticed 
much of a change 
 in the dynamic at all. Um... 
we still seem to just get 
 along really, really well.
There's only been two days 
 together as two teams 
so there isn't, uh, really time 
 for conflict to develop yet. 
Gretchen, is it 
 too soon to think 
that strategies might shift? 
Oh, I think people who are 
strategically playing the game, 
um, you know, strategy 
 has changed for them. 
How so? 
Well, from who's strongest 
in your tribe to keep, 
now who's strongest 
in this one tribe to get rid of 
'cause they're 
your biggest competition. 
Sean, aside from the physical-- 
who you want to hang
 out with, who you 
 like being around-- 
how big a factor is that
now going to play 
 in who you vote for?
Well, for me it's still 
 a very big factor. 
I think there's a lot of room 
 in a group of ten to not think 
ultra-strategically
 just yet. 
In talking to my tribe 
and talking to their tribe 
as the ambassador 
I think that most people
 are very concerned 
about alliances,
 just having 
a Tagi versus Pagong internal 
 bloodbath, you know, and 
it's a-- 
yeah, that's a good word-- 
but, uh, I don't think 
 that's going to occur. 
The rain is really coming down 
 all of a sudden. 
All right, the only
 person for whom 
this does not really factor 
 in tonight is Greg. 
You cannot vote
 for Greg. 
He however, 
 can still vote
for you, and will vote 
 for one of you. 
So with that, 
it's time to vote.
Greg, you're up first.
Either be here, or be gone. 
I'm voting for Rudy. 
He's probably the person that 
 I respect most in the tribe, 
but the person I least 
 want to play the game with.
Overconfident. 
Moo. 
I am not really employing 
 any strategy. 
I'm voting for Colleen today. 
I love her, she's cute, 
 adorable and nice to look at 
and fun to 
 have around,
but she's the first
 in a long list 
of alphabetical order 
and she won't get 
 another vote from me 
unless she pisses me off 
 or something. 
But it's her turn today, 
 being the first... 
alphabetical order. 
JEFF: 
 Directly across from you 
 are the six torches 
representing the first six 
 people voted off. 
Tonight, one of your torches 
 will be added to that group. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
All right, I'll
 read the votes.
"Jenna." 
"Rich." 
"Gretchen." 
"Rudy." 
"Sue." 
"Colleen." 
"Gervase." 
Everybody 
got nailed. 
"Gretchen." 
"Gretchen." 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God! 
It's me. 
Gretchen, 
 I need you
to bring me
 your torch.
The tribe has spoken. 
Yeah, they have. 
It's time for 
 you to go. 
Good-bye. 
( all saying good-bye ) 
Well, if tonight's vote
is any indication,
the stakes have 
 definitely been raised.
You guys can head back to camp. 
I'll see you
 tomorrow. 
Next week on Survivor... 
Greg cuts his play kitten 
 Colleen loose. 
You look right in the kitten's 
 eye and snap its neck. 
It's nothing personal; 
 you're hungry. 
And makes a move on Rich. 
RICH: 
 He's trying something. 
 That's great. 
Tagi continues to plot. 
Then it's their team, 
 one by one by one. 
And things aren't great 
 for Jenna. 
I miss my beauties. 
Now it seems like 
 she wants to leave the island. 
I would hope that 
it was because 
they felt that 
 I was a threat, 
unless, you know, people 
 had a conflict with me 
and didn't 
 ever voice it-- 
which I do think 
 is kind of an injustice. 
And I would hope 
that if somebody had 
 a problem with me 
they would say it. 
 So, you know, I can hope that, 
but I won't know 
until I watch the show. 
I can hope that 
it was because 
they thought 
I was a threat. 
That would make me feel good.
