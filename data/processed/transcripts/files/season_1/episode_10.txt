 --- 

         in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Separated into two tribes, 
 Tagi and Pagong 
they competed against each 
 other to remain on the island. 
But now the tribes 
 have merged into one. 
Rattana is the name, and it is 
 everyone for themselves. 
Every third night 
the entire tribe will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the tribal council 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 








Last week on Survivor... 
Kelly began to have doubts 
 about her role in the alliance.
KELLY: 
 If we stick with it 
it's just like lining lambs 
 to the slaughter. 
Who goes next? Who goes... 
 that's no fun. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 And tension mounted 
 when Rudy burned the food. 
Pathetic, burnt
overdone, wasteful, again. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 Colleen won 
 the reward challenge... 
and invited Jenna 
 to a barbecue meal 
where a plan was hatched 
 to vote Rich off the island. 
You, me and Gervase 
 could definitely 
do something. 
So let's do it. 








ANNOUNCER: 
 But it wasn't a picnic 
 back at Rattana 
where Rich let it all hang out 
 on his birthday. 
RUDY: 
 When I go home, my wife asks me
 about, well, who was with you 
I'll say a queer that ran around
 bare-assed half of the time. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 At tribal council, the three 
 former members of Pagong 
tried to vote Rich 
 off the island. 
Happy birthday, Rich. 
And Kelly broke 
 the voting alliance 
leaving them only three strong.
But it was Sean who became 
 the unknowing swing vote 
his alphabetical voting 
 strategy, 
casting the death vote 
 for Jenna. 
Last vote... 
"J" for "Jenna." 
ANNOUNCER: 
 Seven people left... 
who will be voted off tonight? 
KELLY: 
 It's weird the day 
 after anybody leaves 
there's just, 
 there's just this void of, 
"Oh, wait," you know, 
 "someone's... 
someone's not here." 
RUDY: 
 Gervase was going to get 
 voted off the last time 
but at the last minute 
 they changed it to Jenna. 
And I think that 
that was the women's idea. 
SUSAN: 
 The sun is out, it's going 
 to be a nice hot day. 
And it's quieter. 
Sorry, Jenna, 
but, man, you talk a lot. 
Do you guys 
 agree with me?
I mean she is very
 hard to live with.
You guys lived with
 her longer than me 
and I don't know how 
 she stayed on your team 
 till you got over here. 
I thought she would have went 
a lot sooner than she did. 
Everybody did.
We've been here for 
 what, 28, 29 days now 
and I don't think people realize
that it's 28 days 
 with people 24/7. 
You know what I mean? 
There's no break. 
It really is 
up in the air 
you never know who's going next.
 And that why I love it. 
You can think 
you're going 
but then 
the surprise comes 
'cause I thought I was going. 
GERVASE: 
 It's like 11 days left. 
I'm totally shocked that 
 I'm still here right now. 
If you look at it 
 since the merger 
it's only been Pagong people 
 being voted off. 
You know, so it's like... 
 something's fishy going on. 
You know, they can deny 
an alliance all they want 
but there's got to be 
 an alliance. 
SEAN: 
 No, I'm not 100% sure. 
If there is an alliance, 
 they are just voting in block 
but I don't know 
 if there is one. 
I haven't been asked to partake 
 in one or anything yet. 
Dirk got four votes. 
Gretchen got four votes. 
Greg got four votes. 
Sean, come on, open your eyes. 
Sean is interesting because 
I'm debating right now 
if I want to vote him off 
at the next council. 
Because he's so scared 
of hurting somebody's feelings 
 by voting for them 
that he's voting 
 alphabetical order. 
I mean, he led the way 
for Jenna to be 
 kicked off yesterday. 
"J" for "Jenna." 
RICHARD: 
 And last night at the council 
Sean realized that his vote 
 impacted who gets voted off 
because we only needed 
 to use three 
of our four allied 
 people's votes 
to get Jenna ejected. 
Whatever vote I was going 
 to go they were going to copy. 
If I knew that 
I would certainly have 
abandoned this strategy earlier.
Everybody yelled at me 
for doing this alphabet... 
I thought I was being fair, 
 but actually 
I think I was targeting people 
and also if they weren't 
 being targeted 
I was going to be targeted. 
Because who the hell wants me 
voting for them, you know? 
Either I was going 
to be out 
or, or I would keep getting 
 other people's feelings hurt. 
COLLEEN: 
 It's like Sean walked into this
and somebody forgot to tell him
 it was a game. 
And he's very concerned 
 about people's emotions 
and feelings, 
 which is wonderful 
you know, if you're 
 taking care of a pet. 
You know, not if you're playing
 a game called Survivor 
and the point of the game is to 
strategize and eliminate people.
It just felt a little scummy 
 to me at the time 
but after last night where 
 the remaining tribe members 
of both parties said 
 we really don't care, 
it's just a game, 
every single one of them 
has tried to form a strategy 
 with me personally. 
RICHARD: 
 Now people are talking 
 about planning 
and plotting and strategy. 
And it's just so funny. 
So utterly, utterly, 
 utterly naive 
that there would be any room 
left to plot or strategize now. 
Rich is very arrogant, 
 very cocky 
and very, very overconfident. 
And I thought, you know what 
let's take Rich down 
 a couple pegs. 
RICHARD: 
 I got bombarded 
at the council, 
 at the immunity council. 
Little alliance 
tried to attack Richie 
on my birthday. 
But I lived. 
 Now he's going to 
 not fish no more. 
How freaking funny 
would it have been if he got 
sent home on his birthday, 
though? 
I wasn't even 
expecting that. 
Rich was this close 
 to leaving last week. 
That was a good feeling. 
For me, it was just 
 a great feeling. 
And you could see 
 it's affected Rich. 
After those three votes, 
 Rich was... 
he couldn't believe it. 
Rich even thinks I, uh... 
formed an alliance 
 against him last night. 
Which I didn't. 
That's okay, 
no hard feelings. 
I'll just catch 
less fish. 
We like the fish, Rich. 
Yeah, I thought you 
liked the fish, Gerv. 
Not as much as I thought 
you did, though. 
RICHARD: 
 When I fish 
 is somewhat strategic. 
So I'm thinking to myself 
it would be a heck 
 of a lot more valuable 
I guess to me, if I got fish 
after a couple more folks 
 were gone. 
And I'll limit the fish 
 that I'm getting 
so that I'm not out here 
 working my ass off 
and people just expect that 
 there will be lots of fish. 
When we get down 
to the last four 
or five of us 
I'll feed us 
like kings. 
 I can't wait. 
I can't wait. 
It ain't happening
 fast enough. 
 I know. 
Enjoy your day.
Okay, thanks, 
you be careful. 
I'll see you later. 
All right, bye-bye. 
SUSAN: 
 I don't blame him one bit 
 for not worrying about fishing 
till there's five people. 
That's a lot of mouths to feed 
 and they don't appreciate it. 
RICHARD: 
 There are analogies between 
 my going out to the reef 
and hunting the fish 
and my picking off the tribe 
 members one by one. 
I've been stalking them since 
 before we got on the island. 
Bye-bye, baby. 
 ( Gulps ) 
it's a slow, more methodical 
 game here on the island 
with each of the tribe members 
 than it is with the fish 
but there are similarities. 
That's probably the last fish 
 I'll get until there are five. 
There are seven participants 
 right now 
and I probably won't bother 
 to get any more fish 
until there are five people. 
SUSAN: 
 Colleen and Gervase 
 are just sitting over there 
and I'm like, 
 "You backstabbers." 
First you want him out of here,
and then you're 
 all over the food. 
I'm getting 
 filled up tonight 
 on one bowl. 
That's sad.
( burps ) 
Ooh, good rice,
 Rudy. 
Go, Suzy, go. 
You're the best. 
I got some nice belches 
 out here. 
My strategy all along 
has been to just play the role 
 as a dumb redneck. 
( belches ) 
there you go, 
 Suzy Q. 
SUSAN: 
 People like think rednecks 
 are so vulnerable and dumb 
they'll talk to them openly. 
Like Rich did. 
( laughs ) 
you know, how he's going 
 to burn everybody. 
Okay, so here's 
the deal. 
I want you to pick her 
to be ejected, not me. 
So you can plan that. 
SUSAN: 
 Hopefully in the end 
the, the old redneck will burn 
 the city slickers. 
So we'll see what happens. 
You know, I think it 
would be best 
is if we can, 
me and you 
can take care of...
 take him out 
 at the end. 
Take Rich out? 
 Yeah. 
Just me and you.
I've been knowing all along 
 that I'm going to burn him 
but I didn't want to say 
 anything to Kelly too early. 
Why do you think he got 
 so many votes against him 
at the last council?
He's a snake. I got 
to thank him, though 
for getting our crap 
together early. 
If it wasn't for him, 
we might not have 
gotten together this early. 
I never trusted Rich. 
Of course I don't trust him. 
But am I doing a good job 
making him think I trust him? 
I hope it looks 
 like I trust him now. 
I knew he was working on 
you to get me out anyway. 
Oh, yeah. 
He's not that 
 ... smart. 
Right now I don't trust anybody
 except for Kelly. 
I trust Kelly 100%. 
100%, And she trusts me 
 the same. 
We're like sisters. 
I want me and you 
to take him out. 
I think so.
Just the three 
of us. 
But you got 
 to let him... 
I really would. 
I would feel good. 
I would feel so good
 about myself. 
KELLY: 
 I really like Sue a lot. 
We've bonded quite a bit 
 in these 30 days. 
And it'll be 20 years 
 come this Easter 
that I lost my best friend. 
So, coming across Kelly, 
 somebody I can hang with... 
that's a long... 
I ain't going to ... her. 
I'm not burning her. 
KELLY: 
 The only person I trust 
is Sue, and sometimes 
 I doubt that. 
It's getting to that point 
where you don't know 
 who you can trust. 
RICHARD: 
 But I got to remember 
it's a game. 
 And I believe them.
I believe you,
 I believe her.
And I believe Kelly.
But I don't know if Kelly 
 is as solid as that 
all the way through, 
 I hope so. 
I'm betting on it. 
I was betting on it by bringing 
 her into this. 
And I'm feeling 
 very good about Sue.
If they're not
then they're brilliant 
because they've played me well. 
They've played me beautifully. 
SUSAN: 
 I'd rather just me and Kelly 
 burn him. 
Just because 
 it'll feel so good. 
RICHARD: 
 If the alliance 
 were to break down 
and something else happened 
 that I wasn't aware of 
I would shake those people's 
 hands and say congratulations 
you, you know, brilliant 
good job, you got it 
because you've fooled me. 
Me and Kelly 
 are taking him down. 
Watch out for that. 
Hark! 
 Uh-oh. 
A cigar!
 A message! 
RICHARD:
 Uh-oh. 
Oh, shut up.
Only one cigar?
Are we going 
to have to roll 'em? 
No, there's more. 
Yee-hah! 
Whoo! 
Roll that bad boy, 
 light that bad boy 
smokin'! 
Awesome! 
Yeah! 
Okay. 
"This is an announcement 
 for Gervase... 
( gasping ): 
 Gervase! 
Yay! 
 Nah-uh. 
Yay, Gervase! 
About your son.
"Gunner Peterson was born 
 yesterday at 3:05..." 
Hey, everybody, 
it's a boy! 
Smoke up! 
Smoke up. 
RICHARD: 
I didn't even know Gerv was 
having another baby. 
GERVASE: 
 It's real simple. 
I have two kids 
 from a previous relationship: 
Dawnelle's ten, 
 Genelle is seven. 
I'm with Carmela now
Kayla with her and now Gunner. 
You know, Kayla's two 
 and Gunner's the new addition. 
Four kids-- holy Moses. 
Now are you 
and, uh, Gunner 
and Kayla's mom together 
 permanently? 
GERVASE: 
 Nah, never 
 been married. 
Yeah, we have 
 some rough spots
we need to fix that 
so we're just smoothing 
 those out, you know. 
RUDY: 
 When I was brought up, 
 if a girl was pregnant 
and wasn't married, 
you'd never even know it. 
I mean, they'd take her out 
 of town or somewhere. 
It was that bad, you know. 
The girl could have
 had an abortion. 
I-I'll agree with an abortion. 
But not having kids 
 out of wedlock. 
It's a huge responsibility. 
Huge. 
It's hard enough 
for one family, 
much less two. 
Yeah, one child's 
 a huge responsibility 
let alone two. 
Four kids between two families.
No way, man. 
Oh, no way.
Is it empty? 
It's empty.
Oh, what a... 
Aah... 
 Oh, man. 
Oh, my god. 
WOMEN: 
Pizza! 
You were talking 
about pizza. 
"An oven fresh pizza, 
 doesn't that sound nice? 
"A phone call's been placed, 
steady feet win a slice." 
Some balancing crap. 
It's going to be 
 some balance. 
"Steady feet," 
 could it be hot coals? 
No. 
 No. 
"A phone call's been placed," 
 they called Pizza Hut. 
That's what that means. 
Uh... 
Day 28 on the island
and after almost 
 a month of nothing
rewards are everything. 
Today's reward challenge 
 is very simple: 
Simply stay on your feet 
 long enough 
to make it from one end 
 of the course to the other. 
For the winner-- 
 a phone call home 
with the Ericsson world phone, 
 to the person of their choice 
plus a slice of hot pizza, 
 delivered by helicopter. 
Hi, Jeff. 
What's up, G? 
Sean. 
What's happening? 
Congratulations on your baby. 
Thank you, sir. 
JEFF: 
That's great news. 
The game is 
very simple. 
You're moving across 
 bamboo poles. 
The first one to the end wins. 
Speed and balance are key. 
There's going to be three legs 
 to the race. 
In the first leg, the fastest 
 four will move on; 
in the second leg, the fastest 
 two will move on. 
The third leg is for the prize. 
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?! 
Go!
( shrieks ) 
Yeah. 
( clapping ) 
JEFF: 
 Had to stay on.
Ah, come on. 
You had to stay up.
We're looking for two here. 
Survivors, ready?!
Go!
Whoa, it's Rich
 and... Gervase.
Sue, it was Gervase by a nose. 
You're always 
 in there, though. 
Yeah? That's all right. 
JEFF: 
 Richard and Gervase
you have to get
 across here. 
The first person 
 here, the other 
 guy's got to secede.
Don't push him off.
You got to land here
and plant it 
 with two feet.
If you fall off 
the next guy gets 
 a shot, you go back.
For the prize, 
 survivors ready?! 
Go!
Gervase. 
 ( others cheering ) 
baby, you're getting
 some pizza and 
 a phone call home. 
Good effort, man. 
Good effort.
All right, Gervase, 
 here comes your pizza.
Is that it? 
That's it. 
Hang tight. 
Oh... 
Hot slice of cheese. 
The middle of the 
 South China Sea, 
pizza delivered 
 by a helicopter.
It is your slice 
to enjoy here. 
So have at it. 
Gerv, it's all yours. 
Do not share, Gerv.
Gerv, eat it. 
Nobody wants it? 
Nobody wants it? 
I want a bite. 
I don't want 
 any really. 
Take a big bite. 
 Oh, yeah. 
I know you're 
a big pizza fan. 
Thank you, Gerv.
This is plenty for me. 
Now finish it up. 
GERVASE: 
That's a big slice. 
All right, Gerv.
JEFF: 
 Okay, Gervase, now for 
 the second part of the reward. 
We have a cell phone here. 
If I said you could make 
one phone call, 
who would you call? 
Don't even say it. 
Gervase, don't
 even think it.
I'm going to call 
 Carmela, see how 
 the baby is. 
ALL: 
 Yay! 
All right, it's 3:00 A.M. 
 In Jersey right now. 
We're not going 
 to call right now, 
waste it when she's asleep, 
 may not answer. 
Tomorrow morning, 
I'll come back 
over to Rattana, 
I'll bring the phone, 
we'll call home, talk to mom, 
see how things are going. 
Sounds good, Jeff.
 You the man. 
Way to go. 
All right, 
enjoy your pizza. 
Let's walk along
 this way. 
RUDY: 
 Ten more days-- 
 it'll all be over. 
I'll probably never see
 these people again. 
The way I want it. 
Going to make my phone call 
 to my family. 
See how everybody's doing, 
 make sure they're doing good. 
I certainly don't judge him 
for being not married 
 and having kids. 
I mean, he had one relationship,
and then he had another 
 relationship, 
and he seems to be 
 in a relationship now 
with a woman where he's had 
 two children, 
and is working toward 
a committed, long-term 
 relationship 
to parent those children 
 together. 
I don't agree with babies 
 out of wedlock 
that kind of garbage, you know? 
Half of the problem they got 
 in this country today, 
there's no family life. 
And then they're blaming 
 the schools. 
It starts way before 
 them kids go to school. 
They need a family. 
They need somebody beating them 
 in the head. 
( cell phone dialing ) 
( phone ringing ) 
CARMELA: 
 Hello? 
Hello. 
It's me. 
Are you all right? 
Huh? 
Are you all right? 
( laughs ) 
How are you? 
I'm fine. 
How's the baby? 
I'm sitting here with him 
in my arms 
and Kayla's just kissing him. 
Like, all she does 
is play with his hair. 
Does he have a lot of hair? 
Oh, yeah? Like Kayla? 
Or more than her? 
You want to talk 
to daddy? 
Say, "Hi, daddy." 
Daddy. 
Hey, Kayla! 
What are you doing? 
Daddy. 
Yeah, give him a kiss, 
say, "Bye-bye." 
Tell him, say, "Bye-bye." 
( laughs ) 
What, she's in shock? 
 It's been that long? 
COLLEEN: 
 I mean it's better 
 that he's not married, 
'cause he has 
 issues right now
 with Carmela 
and it's better 
 that they're not married 
than just get married 
and then have problems later on.
From talking to him the other 
 day, I kind of got the scoop, 
and I'm sure you probably heard 
 a little more, 
but the first girl he was with, 
he really tried 
to stay with her and everything 
especially for the kids, 
and she was kind of the one 
 who was just, like, 
"Look, it's not going to work." 
So, I think he-he's very 
responsible with his kids. 
He's paying for the kids. 
He's spending time 
 with the kids. 
He's being a dad. 
It wouldn't be my choice, 
 but that's his, 
and he's free to make that. 
I really am so proud of you. 
I can't believe there's 
 11 days left 
and you are still in it. 
I'm just trying to, uh, 
 finish it out. 
I've taken care 
 of all your bills 
and all that other stuff. 
Well, let everybody know 
 I miss them. 
Tell your mom I even miss her. 
Yeah, unbelievable, isn't it? 
I love you and Kay loves you 
 and Gunner loves you. 
And, uh, so... you know. 
I love you. 
 Tell Gunner I love him. 
Tell Kay I love her. 
All right. 
Come on, let's see 
how his phone call went. 
Oh, he's here?
Oh, he's right there. 
Tell us about 
the whole situation. 
Talk to Carmela? 
Yeah, she's
 doing good.
He's doing good, 
 everybody's 
 just doing great. 
We seriously, 
seriously lucked out. 
I have no idea 
 what I would have done 
had I ended up on Pagong 
 in the beginning. 
Oh, me, too.
Committed suicide. 
I'd have killed
 somebody. 
I could never have built 
 alliances 
such solid ones, 
 particularly, too. 
They're too flaky. 
Changes with 
the wind. 
Too immature, yeah, 
 is what it is. 
Like, Kelly's even
 a little flaky, 
 at moments. 
She's doing well, though. 
Yeah. 
I mean, for 22, she's amazing. 
Oh, yeah, 
 yeah, yeah.
I hope she's solid. 
KELLY: 
 This is not what I thought 
 it was going to be like. 
It's not about surviving 
 the elements. 
It's about surviving yourself. 
I didn't want to be a part 
 of the alliance 
because I thought it was 
 conniving and dirty 
 and untrue to myself. 
GERVASE: 
 I don't think Kelly really 
 wanted to make an alliance 
with anybody here in Tagi. 
I think they kind of 
 strong-armed Kelly 
into making an alliance 
 and joining their team, 
and it's really affected her 
 personally, like, 
as a tug-of-war on the inside. 
KELLY: 
 It's not worth it to feel like 
 ... for the rest of your life, 
um, for a little bit of money, 
 and your 15 minutes. 
You know, I kind of feel like 
 Luke Skywalker, or something. 
I crossed over to the dark side
 for a moment. 
I don't like playing the game 
 that way. 
Does that feel like 
it fits your face okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
KELLY: 
 Making a deal with Rich 
is kind of like making a deal 
 with the devil. 
Then you know how to use it 
 to breath, or no? 
KELLY: 
 I decided a while ago 
not to be part 
 of the big alliance. 
It's automatic. 
I don't know if I could do that.
You'd be surprised. 
Like right now, 
 you are. 
KELLY: 
 I've been pretty much 
 letting Rich think 
that I'm still part of his 
little mind-game, follower thing
the whole time, basically, 
 because I figured 
if I did tell him 
 that I grew a conscience 
and I didn't want to be 
 his little follower anymore 
that he would turn around 
 and shut me down, 
which I'm certain he would have,
so, I'm glad I didn't tell him.
RICHARD: 
You're seeming more down 
and more serious to me 
toward the end. 
Really? 
Mm-hmm. 
A lot more so than... 
early on. 
KELLY: 
 Do I just kind of roll over 
 and let Rich decide 
how it's all going to play out 
or do I try and beat him 
 at his own damn game? 
Done. 
Hey! 
Wait, start at the beginning. 
Did it start? 
Yeah. 
"Seeking immunity is
 part of the game 
"now you'll rely on
 a flickering flame.
"Safety tomorrow is
 just within reach 
wait until sunset 
 and head to the beach." 
COLLEEN: 
 Kelly is really hard for me 
to talk with about voting 
 and about alliances. 
So smart, 
they duped everybody. 
I mean, because she could 
 really be in 
for forming an alliance 
 because you see her now 
being kind of 
 pulled back and 
 forth, you know?
In one way, 
 I think, she feels
that she wants to, like, 
 have fun and be young 
and, like, she said it. 
She was just like, 
 "I can't believe 
I'm in this group 
 with these people." 
She's like, "It's awful." 
RICHARD: 
 I'm liking this breeze. 
SEAN: 
 It's going to make 
 the contest harder.
Did you see the clue? 
We got a clue? 
Over there. 
"Seeking immunity 
 is part of the game
"now you'll rely 
 on a flickering flame 
"safety tomorrow is 
 just within reach 
wait until sunset 
 and head to the beach." 
Something at
 night, man. 
Yeah. 
Some night, 
 night something.
Day 29-- 
what is there to say? 
Nobody's happy 
for anybody else 
when they win 
the immunity challenge. 
At this point 
nobody's safe 
on that stage. 
Everybody knows that. 
This is go-for-broke time. 
This game is designed 
to figure out how much 
you've learned 
since you've been on the island.
We've picked this beach 
'cause it has 
a lot of driftwood. 
The idea is building fire. 
You'll have 
 three minutes 
to go and collect 
 as much driftwood 
and stack it. 
You each have your own fire pit 
 and a weighted flag. 
The second leg of the race, 
 take your staffs 
go out in the water, 
light them, come back here 
use your torch 
 to light your fire. 
The first person 
to burn through this wick 
drops this and raises that-- 
immunity. 
Make sense? 
Let's do it. 
Take a spot. 
This is one, two, three, four. 
Should be seven of them. 
Survivors, ready? 
Go! 
( grunts ) 
JEFF: 
 Two minutes! 
Your branches cannot be touching
 the wick. 
They can be right under it, 
 but they can't be touching it. 
Five, four... 
three, two... 
one. 
Hold on to your staffs; 
 keep that thing above water. 
Survivors, ready?! 
Go! 
JEFF: 
 Remember to light 
 from the base... 
from the fire pit. 
That's it, Richard.
Okay. I got you. 
JEFF: 
You got plenty of time, Gervase.
It's going to take 
 a long time 
for these fires to burn. 
Yeah! 
Oh, good job, Rich. 
I could cook some rice 
over here, though, 
if you want me to. 
Immune! 
GERVASE: 
 Rich got lucky 
 and won his challenge 
and now he's... oh, man! 
Wait till you see him now. 
If you watch Rich 
 the rest of this day 
watch the arrogance 
and the swagger 
 he's walking around with 
'cause he won that immunity 
and he knows 
 he can't be touched tonight. 
What, if anything,
 should be said... 
I think Rich is 
 the ringleader.. 
Or if he's not the ringleader, 
 then he's second in command. 
If I have to say, 
 "Do I know for a fact 
there's an alliance, 
and all this stuff is going on?"
No, I don't know for a fact, 
 but I'm a smart guy, you know. 
I can see things and see 
how things are happening. 
KELLY: 
 I-I was talking to-to Colleen 
and we were just, like, 
 "This sucks!" 
You know, 
 especially for her and Gerv. 
It's like they know 
 they're leaving next 
so they're just going 
 to sit around and wait 
you know, with a red dot 
 pointed to their head? 
You have to keep
 your eye out. 
Gervase, what 
 are you making?
I'm making costumes for tonight.
My code name for tonight... 
is "bull's-eye." 
I'm otherwise known
 as "sitting duck." 
( snickering ) 
GERVASE: 
 I think Rich-- 
being the cocky person 
 that he is-- 
will think that they can 
get rid of me with three votes. 
Now, Sean approached me, 
 saying he wouldn't, uh, mind 
making an alliance, 
 but he said 
he would only do it 
 if Kelly joined us 
so it'd be a sure thing. 
...bringing, like, 
a bundle of sticks 
and every morning... 
so they really only had 
 their three core people: 
Rudy, Rich and Sue 
who probably definitely 
 would be with the plan. 
That leaves four other votes, 
 including mine 
that can go on somebody else. 
So somehow 
 we have to work on Kelly 
and figure out 
 who she's voting for 
and then maybe Colleen 
 can also vote for that person. 
So, the best bet is Kelly. 
SUSAN: 
 Where's Kelly at? 
I don't know. 
KELLY: 
 I wish something exciting 
 would happen-- 
something shocking, 
 something that nobody expects. 
Well, sh... 
Looks like we got some 
thunderheads building out there.
Should provide 
 for an exciting night. 
We're preparing to, uh, 
 batten down the hatches.
( whistling ) 
SEAN: 
 There's going to 
 be a storm tonight.
( thunder rolling ) 
Kelly cut her own throat tonight
and it was a wonderful thing. 
She, uh, tried to align herself 
to the kids her age 
and was probably trying 
 to look a little nicer 
to the other group, 
 but I have a feeling 
she's got more going on 
 with them 
than she's letting on. 
Whoo! 
She doesn't realize 
we can see it, right through it.
Yeah. Yeah.
Not smart at all. 
Too much playing. 
Yeah. That's not serious. 
No. 
It's serious for me.
Oh, it is for me, too. 
RICHARD: 
 It'll be interesting. 
She could have consequences. 
We haven't decided yet. 
"We." Hmm... 
( sniffs ) 
( conch shell blowing ) 
( gong sounding ) 
we're going to go ahead 
 and bring our jury in 
as you guys 
are sitting down. 
Okay. 
Sean. 
I got to revisit
the alphabet voting system 
because it had 
 a dramatic effect 
on the vote 
because it resulted 
in Jenna being ejected. 
What were your
 thoughts when 
 you left here?
Uh, when we went back to camp, 
 I was pretty much devastated. 
Everyone was around... 
 we hung around by the campfire 
and uh, both the 
 remaining Pagong people
and the remaining 
 Tagi people urged me
implored me to, uh, vote, um, 
in my own best interest-- 
to get with the program. 
In the immortal words 
of Sue, 
"to get some balls." 
And that's what I plan to do 
 from here on out. 
Kelly, we haven't talked much 
 about your strategy 
in terms of voting. 
You got to 
 have one at
 this point.
Sure. Why not? 
I think everybody does. 
What is it?
 What's it 
 based on? 
It's based on who's competition 
and who's pissing me off. 
( Colleen laughs ) 
How about you, Colleen? 
Actually, tonight I'd like to be
 referred to as "sitting duck." 
"Sitting duck"?
Yes, thank you. 
You feel as though
 you might be 
a target tonight? 
Definitely. 
 I'm just waiting. 
And that's based on what? 
That's based on eyes and ears 
and alliances and nonalliances. 
Sue.
Um, we're all sitting here. 
We're adults. 
This is a game, but the game 
also reflects a lot on real life
and you always bring up 
 this alliance thing. 
Well, America is run 
 on alliance. 
The minute somebody gives money 
 to the president 
for his campaign as a lobbyist, 
 that's an alliance. 
Don't tell me 
 he doesn't think
he doesn't owe
 them anything,
'cause he does.
They help put him 
 where he's at. 
Same thing goes 
when people join a church 
and they're not religious, 
but they join the church 
because they want to make 
connections for, be it 
they're an 
 insurance agent
and want to sell more 
 insurance in town, 
or they're a 
 real estate agent 
and they want to sell 
real estate. 
So they want to meet up 
with people. 
So there is going 
 to be alliance. 
Don't tell me 
 there ain't an alliance. 
Well, Tagi, we lived together 
 for 20 days 
built a house, built a camp, 
 comfortable 
totally happy with each other, 
 like we ain't going to have 
some kind of 
 bonding there.
Yeah, there's going
 to be alliances. 
This is just a chess game. 
It's the way life goes. 
JEFF: 
 Richard.
According to 
 Colleen and Sue
there is 
 an alliance.
Is there? Geez... 
is there a way to break
 the alliance right now?
If you were looking at
 this from the outside 
is there a way
 to break it? 
I have no idea who is 
completely trustworthy, 
 who isn't. 
I think there's
 always a way 
that things 
 could break down. 
( sputters lips ) 
Who knows what's going 
 to happen. 
It's all a game. 
All right, it's time to vote. 
Gervase, you're up.
My vote is for Sean, 
as Sean has made a huge mistake 
in not seeing that 
 Tagi had an alliance 
from day three on this island, 
and he couldn't even 
 see anything happening. 
So, for a smart guy, 
 he has no common sense, 
no brains in his head, really, 
when it comes down to it. 
So Sean really deserves 
 this vote. 
Hmm. I wonder how you spell it. 
I don't know. 
Anyways, you're a nice guy, 
 I wish you the best of luck... 
but I'm tired of getting beat 
at the competitions 
 by you, guy, so... 
I think Sean was, uh-- 
I hope this is how 
 you spell your name-- 
pretty pathetic, this week 
 because, uh, first he goes, 
"I'm looking out 
for everybody's best interest," 
and now he's looking out 
 for his own interest. 
I think if anybody should 
 get voted off this time 
it should be him 
 without question. 
He's a putz. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
to leave the tribal council area
 immediately. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote... 
"Sean." 
"Sean."
"Gervase." 
"Gervase."
Two votes 
 for Gervase;
two votes for Sean.
"Gervase."
"Gervase."
I won't read 
 the last vote.
It's irrelevant. 
Gervase... 
I need you to bring
 me your staff. 
The tribe has spoken. 
It's time for 
 you to go. 
Bye. 
JEFF: 
 Well, you have 
 survived another one. 
We're down to six 
getting close 
 to our final two. 
You guys can head back to camp. 
See you tomorrow. 
ANNOUNCER: 
 Next week, on Survivor: 
One castaway wins 
 a night of luxury. 
JEFF: 
 One night, on a yacht-- 
that yacht.
ANNOUNCER: 
 And as the end draws near, 
 alliances waver. 
COLLEEN: 
 I'm getting to see 
 the breakdown 
of the Tagi alliance. 
When I turn around 
 and see somebody 
starting to dig a knife 
 into my backside 
it just really pisses me off. 
First off, I'd like to say 
that I don't have... 
hold any, like... 
ill feelings 
towards Rich and Sue 
 and anybody in Tagi 
for making an alliance 
 and picking us off one by one. 
It's just that my tribe 
 didn't want to do that. 
They wanted to keep it 
 as an open game-- 
fair is fair, and let 
 the best person end up winning 
the million dollars.
