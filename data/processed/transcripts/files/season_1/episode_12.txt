         ANNOUNCER: 
 16 Americans marooned 
 for 39 days 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Separated into two tribes-- 
 Tagi and Pagong, 
they competed 
 against each other 
to remain on the island. 
But now the tribes 
 have merged into one. 
Rattana is the name, 
and it is everyone 
 for themselves. 
Every third night, 
the entire tribe will hike 
 deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council, 








where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, one will remain 
and will leave the island 
 with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor: 
The Tagi alliance 
 threatened to crumble. 
RICHARD: 
 It seems like Kelly might be 
 flip-flopping 
and planning strategies 
 at our expense. 
SUSAN: 
 When I turn around 
 and see somebody 
starting to dig 
 a knife into my backside, 
it just really pisses me off. 
JEFF: 
 And island living was wearing 
 on the castaways. 
COLLEEN: 
 It's not a fun game now. 
JEFF: 
 Sean won a night 
 on a yacht 
and a surprise visit 
 from his dad. 








Dad! 
Kelly found herself 
 in hot water. 
RICHARD: 
 Kelly, on the other hand, 
 has no idea 
that she's leaving 
 this evening. 
JEFF: 
 But she saved herself 
by winning 
 the immunity challenge. 
Instead, Colleen paid the price
and was the final Pagong member
 voted off. 
Only five from the original 
 Tagi Tribe remain. 
It's anyone's guess who will 
 be voted off tonight. 
RICHARD: 
 Why are we leaving 
 Rattana, though? 
That's the stupidest
 thing I ever heard. 
SUSAN: 
 You think that 
 Rattana played on? 
Yeah. 
RICHARD: 
A bunch of individuals 
playing a game. 
Rattana was absolutely 
meaningless. 
SEAN: 
Rattana was meaningless. 
SUSAN: 
Yeah, Rattana was 
meaningless. 
Tagi was... meant something.
RICHARD: 
 Our name. 
Oh, yeah, especially 
when we were up 
against Pagong. 
There's no such thing as... 
for me, a Tagi Tribe 
 or a Rattana. 
That was the stupidest thing 
 I ever heard. 
Or... or any other tribe. 
It never existed 
 and it doesn't exist. 
It's a group of 16 people, 
four of whom were in 
 an alliance 
with me 
 and a bunch of other ones. 
And it meant something. 
Now it's five individuals 
just playing a game 
and hanging out. 
That's good.
SEAN: 
 Yeah, everyone's hunky-dory 
 and all friends, 
but they all come to me 
and they say bad things 
 about Richard, 
or they say bad things 
 about Rudy, 
and then they go to Rudy 
and they say bad things 
 about me, 
and they go to Rich, 
they say bad things 
 about Rudy and I. 
Sean's just... you know, 
talking to me all day about 
making sure I convince 
my man-- Rudy-- 
to vote for Sue.
If somebody gave me their word 
that they are in this alliance 
 with me, 
and I give my word, 
 my word is good, 
and their word better be good. 
If they betray me, 
 I'll get even with them. 
Rudy talks about, "People 
give me their word... 
"I have friends. 
"I have friends back at home 
that take care 
 of people like that." 
Oh, man. 
I don't know 
who I'm playing with here. 
I'm, like, "Get me out of here. 
 Send me home." 
Rudy's 
 something else. 
RUDY: 
 I mean, it's a game, 
but it's worth 
 a million dollars. 
Money talks. 
You've pretty much 
got Rudy... 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Under control. 
He always just looks 
 to me and goes... 
He goes, 
"Hey, who?" 
I don't care. 
 Don't worry about it. 
You have my word 
 and I gave it to you... 
Rich is a smart guy 
 and he's really tricky, 
and, uh, I don't trust him 
 one bit. 
I never really have. 
Whatever it takes to win here 
 is the point. 
It's a game, and call it 
 Machiavellian, sure. 
I'd much rather 
 it be Rudy left.
Than Sue. 
'Cause then you and I are, 
 you know, definitely... 
going 
 to the top. 
So Kelly goes next. 
So it will now be 
 you, Sean, me and Sue. 
I don't think you're any 
better off against anybody else.
In other words, getting there 
with anybody but me. 
Hopefully, it 
 will be us three. 
SEAN: 
 This is the most 
conniving bunch of people 
 I've ever met in my life. 
There's not an honest one 
 in the bunch. 
Conniving, conniving, 
 conniving. 
Things are falling apart here 
at Rattana Beach. 
( voices arguing ) 
You told them you 
 weren't aligned with us.
Colleen told me that. 
That's bull ( blip ). 
I don't give a ( blip ),
because I trust her 
 more than I trust you. 
Why? That's bull ( blip ). 
I've been your friend 
since day one. 
No. I'm going fishing. 
That's bull ( blip ). 
Will you talk to me? 
No. I don't have to. 
What did you 
just ask Sue? 
Sue feels that 
I ( blip ) her... 
or have ( blip ) 
the four of us... 
I don't understand 
what that's coming from. 
Because... because I tried 
to make the Pagong team think 
that we weren't going 
to eliminate them one by one? 
I thought that 
was part of the game. 
SUSAN: 
 Kelly made all the rest of us 
 look like a bunch of idiots. 
Then she made all the rest of us
 look like the bad guys 
and her the one good guy 
 out of the whole five of us. 
That's what irritated me. 
Sue doesn't have
 all the facts. 
Uh-huh. 
I was trying to pretend 
that we weren't going 
 to eliminate 
them one by one, 
 as I've said before, 
and I thought that was 
 part of the plan. 
We had said 
when they come, 
we're going 
to split up, 
we're going to hang 
out with them. 
I wasn't trying to work them 
 for myself at all. 
They all wanted to vote you off.
They tried to come to me 
 and say, 
"Hey, we can be in the majority.
 We can vote Rich off." 
I didn't. 
I know. 
I think it was a smart decision.
Sue said many times that 
 she wasn't part 
of an alliance either. 
So, now all of a sudden 
I'm two-faced and I ( blip ) her
when she had approached me 
 and said, 
"Hey, Rich and I have formed 
 an alliance 
"to vote you off at the end, 
"but I'm not going to do that. 
Let's you and I vote him off." 
If I was trying 
to plot against you 
and plot against Sue... 
Uh-huh. 
...and trying to use them 
in my best interests, 
then I would have 
voted for you. 
But I decided... 
 Yeah, I don't think 
 that's true. 
...I wanted to stay true 
to our... to our alliance-- 
to our four that 
we decided on from 
the beginning. 
Right. Right. 
When Kelly said to me, um, 
"Are you pissed off at me? 
It seems to me like you 
 and Sue are pissed off at me." 
Well, that was my opportunity 
 to come in 
and smooth things, 
as opposed to be the one 
who upsets the applecart. 
Thanks, Kells Bells. 
So certainly that little tiff 
 between Kelly and Sue 
has been coming 
and plays to my advantage, 
 absolutely. 
Aw, it hurts. 
This is my second ray sting 
 since I've been here. 
Oh, and trust me, they hurt. 
It's like an aching sting 
and it hurts from my knuckle 
 down to about here, 
and it's constantly pounding 
 and it aches 
and it hurts really bad. 
I might act like a tough girl, 
 but they do hurt. 
They gouge me. 
This one got me good. 
Notice the hand. 
The knuckles are still swollen 
 from that ray bite. 
I seen that tail come in 
 and just slice that. 
Ow, was I pissed. 
Cause he was 
 in a little hole. 
He couldn't go 
 anywhere but out. 
You know, he couldn't 
 go back or forward. 
He had 
to come out. 
KELLY: 
At least you get 
to eat the bastard. 
RICHARD: 
 Sixth day to the end. 
Desperate to go home. 
Really looking forward 
 to enter reality. 
For me, this maintaining some 
 kind of a thumb 
on ev... all of these different 
 people's personalities 
that I care very little about, 
 uh, is exhausting. 
I'm ready for the people 
in my life that I've brought 
 into my life, 
throughout my life. 
And I'm looking forward 
 to getting back to that 
with a vengeance. 
SEAN: 
 I've been wishing for home 
since the day I got here. 
I haven't been away from 
 New York in this long ever. 
I miss my favorite restaurant. 
I miss the people 
 at the restaurant. 
I miss my friends. 
I miss my family. 
You know, I miss 
 all those things. 
I'm just looking forward 
to talking to my husband 
 on the phone. 
I can't wait for that. 
I get anywhere 
within a phone 
to make a call, 
that's what I'm doing, 
is calling home. 
Uh-huh. 
I don't give a ( blip ) 
what time of day it is there. 
RICHARD: 
 The end of days 
is what I'm thinking about 
 as I lay here on a raft 
in the middle of the 
 South China Sea on a beach-- 
in my bed. 
Yeah, it's very pretty. 
It's a beautiful, 
 beautiful night. 
Cloudy, but I like the clouds. 
I'm just looking at the clouds, 
thinking of going home. 
Waiting... 
waiting... 
with no watch. 
Having no idea what time it is.
Just knowing that time 
 is passing slowly. 
Oh. 
( laughing ) 
"Dig in." 
"Dig in." 
That's mud from 
 the mud volcano.
We got to dig in 
to find the clue? 
Yeah. 
All it is is swamp mud. 
I'm going 
to rinse my hand off. 
I think that's cool. 
What? 
The bucket and the mud. 
We're going to have 
to do some kind of digging. 
Oh, I found it. 
Oh, cool! Read it. 
Read it to me. 
What's it say, Rudy? 
"It might 
 be a dirty job, 
"but now it's up to you. 
Make like a hog 
 at the volcano..." 
"carry mud..." 
ALL: 
 "for an ice-cold brew." 
Another trip out 
of here would be nice. 
That's good news. 
It is. 
JEFF: 
 It's Day 35 on the island 
and old friends 
are becoming new enemies. 
So, for today's 
 reward challenge, 
the tribe members will head 
 to the mud volcano 
and, perhaps, 
 calm things down a little. 
This mud volcano actually 
 created the entire island. 
Today, 
 the tribe members will engage 
in some therapeutic 
 mud bathing. 
Okay, here's 
what I know. 
A bit of a blowout yesterday, 
 shouldn't be unexpected, 
so the idea today is to have 
 a different kind of a blowout. 
The goal is pretty simple: 
get as much mud 
 from the mud volcano 
into your bucket 
 as you can in five minutes, 
using your body 
as the transport vehicle. 
So you go over and lather up 
 as much as you can. 
You come back over here, 
shake off, squeeze out-- 
whatever you want. 
If that doesn't 
 take the tension off, 
nothing 
takes the edge off 
like a cold beer, right? 
So, for the winner, 
one Bud Light. 
That's a warm-up for 
 what's going to happen later. 
Because, 
 for the winner, later, 
you're going to be picked up, 
blindfolded, 
 boated to a mysterious bar, 
where you and I are going 
 to have a few more Bud Lights. 
We're going to watch 
the first five minutes 
of episode one... 
Wow!
...of Survivor. 
Wow! 
I like that.
 Cool? 
SUSAN: 
Yeah. 
 That works for me. 
Okay, I'm going 
to set my beer aside. 
Let's get ready 
to do this thing. 
Survivors ready... 
Get muddy! 
( whooping ) 
( laughing ) 
( squishing ) 
Looking good, Rudy! 
Ten seconds!
Five... 
four... 
three... 
two... 
Stop! Stop, 
stop, stop. 
All right. 
 That was fun. 
That was a blast. 
This is going to be close. 
Wow. 
 All right, 
 we'll start on the end. 
Man! 
Don't you have 
 to move over? 
SUSAN: 
 Stop bouncing. 
Oh, this is going 
 to be so close. 
15.9 for Kelly. 
That's not 
 bad at all. 
Yeah, Rudy, I don't 
think you're as heavy. 
No. 
No, that's not 
going to do it. 
Right at about ten. 
Need a little 
 more coverage. 
Susan, you've 
got a big bucket. 
25 pounds. 
15.9 is the number. 
15. 
No. Aw, they get the heavy mud. 
15.9 is the number 
to beat. 
This is Sean. 
Who's ahead? 
SEAN: 
 Sean-- 16. 
Sean was 
using his hair. 
Not going 
 to be enough. 
SUSAN: 
 Wow, Kelly. 
Wow!
One guy left. 
15.9. I don't think 
it's going to be enough. 
It looks like it's too easy 
 for you to carry. 
I think I'm having 
a beer with Kelly. 
Oh, you're out. 
It's not even close.
Wow! 
Yeah! 
Give you a big hug. 
Give me a big hug. 
I wish I had a bigger chest 
 to carry the mud. 
I've been muddy, 
but not this kind. 
It feels good to, 
 you know, win something. 
I haven't won much of anything, 
but I won yesterday 
 and I won today. 
I'd feel better if it was 
 an immunity that I won today, 
but, hopefully, 
 I'm on a winning streak. 
Everybody was very pissy 
 prior to the mud bath, 
myself included. 
Things really 
 changed here today. 
There was a fight, 
 for the first time 
between Kelly and Sue, but, 
 truthfully, 
this little shenanigan game 
at the mud bath thing 
 really paid off, I think. 
And it did-- it rejuvenated us.
I think it rekindled, you know,
 just, like, friendships 
and laughing, 
 and things like that. 
SUSAN: 
 Yeah, the mud game 
 was a blast. 
I had a blast. Fun-- 
 totally a lot of fun. 
When we got back from the mud, 
 we were washing... 
helping each other 
 get the mud off 
and things like that. 
Let me clean my ears out, 
then you take it. 
RICHARD: 
 It's bizarre to me 
how people do the things 
 they do-- 
like how Sue and Kelly 
are washing each other's back 
 and hair 
and, you know, laughing, joking
and hugging, 
 and picking each other's zits 
and all the rest of it 
right now, after what 
they went through yesterday. 
SUSAN: 
 Doing the mud thing really wore
a lot of energy out of us, 
so it did key us down 
 quite a bit. 
And Kelly's the only other girl
 on the island with me, 
so we're going 
 to hang together to the end. 
This is my big 
 getting-ready moment. 
I hear a boat. 
I do, I hear the boat. 
Here he comes-- 
the wondrous one. 
Bigger boat, girl. 
They brought your limo 
to pick you up. 
Have fun on your 
 night out, kiddo. 
Have fun. 
 I hope there's... 
Have a good one, kid. 
See you later. 
Bye, you guys. 
See you later. 
Now I'm going 
to take you this way. 
Hear that. 
Oh, a bar. 
There's cigarettes 
if you're so inclined. 
Can I get food, too?
And food, yes. 
Okay, hold on. 
Let me pull 
 your chair out. 
Oh, a chair... 
Look at you! 
Okay, right over 
here, actually. 
Now sit down. 
If you feel 
like you're getting looks, 
that's because there aren't... 
More Americans blindfolded. 
Typical. 
This looks normal. 
Uh-huh. 
Okay, want a beer? 
Yes. 
Can we get two Buds? 
Thanks. 
Yay!
Right on. 
Thank you, 
 thank you. 
All right, let's toast. 
That's 
 good stuff. 
This Bud's for you. 
Oh, thank you. 
Cheers. 
Cheers. 
Aah! 
Oh, my God. 
Thank you. 
Look at this huge plate. 
Let me get that salt. 
So how you hanging in? 
I'm doing good. 
Yeah? 
Yeah, the game's, 
 um... you know, 
finally 
 gotten weird. 
It's finally 
 gotten crazy. 
Finally 
 gotten intense. 
Really? 
I thought 
 I could trust Sue, 
which was 
 my first mistake. 
I guess you can't 
 trust anybody. 
I don't lose any
 respect for her 
for playing the game at all. 
We're not... you know, 
I said something today 
 on the trail... 
I was, like, wait a minute-- 
 we're not evil. 
We just play bad people on TV. 
Whether it's every 
 man for himself 
or whatever, I would like to, 
 uh... 
smooth things over with Sue, 
because that was just 
 completely... there was no... 
It'll be interesting 
to see how this plays out. 
I know. 
JEFF: 
 I have a very special friend 
that I was going to show her 
 something on the TV. 
Is that okay? 
Okay. 
 Yeah. 
( patrons applauding ) 
All right. 
( patrons cheering ) 
How many do I need? 
Where's our box? 
Where's the Tagi box? 
JEFF: 
 You are witnessing 
16 Americans begin 
 an adventure that will forever 
change their lives. 
They've been given two minutes 
to salvage whatever they can 
off this boat. 
Yeah, go, Jenna!
That was awesome. 
That was so cool. 
The Tagi Tribe, 
 who will always wear orange, 
consists of Rudy Boesch, 
 a retired Navy SEAL, 
and Kelly Wiglesworth, 
a river guide from Las Vegas... 
( patrons cheering ) 
Oh, my God! 
Good night. 
I'll see you later. 
RICHARD: 
 Today is the fourth day 
till the end of competition-- 
the 36th day of our game. 
I've said it 14 times today 
and I still can't keep it 
 in my head. 
Let's keep it 
 fun around here 
for the next, 
 you know... 
Keep it fun? 
 Yeah. 
It's going 
to be tough, 
emotion-wise 
between Sue and Kelly. 
And Kelly, I think, 
is going to be 
a little sadder. 
She's sitting over 
 there with her, 
 so that's good. 
I'm waiting 
to manage conflict. 
Well, you got one. 
I've come 
to a conclusion. 
I align with my family, 
who I love dearly and... 
There is four days left, 
 and we're all going to have 
 to live together. 
And Sue and I, 
 we kind of patched things up 
and she said, 
 "Hey, look, this is a game. 
"I'm going to have 
 an alliance with Rich 
instead of you." 
I said, "Fine. That's cool. 
 Play the game." 
If you feel that
 you need to 
 align with Rich 
to get you 
 as far as you can...
That's what I'm saying. 
And you're 
 playing the game
and, you know, 
 I respect that, 
but I didn't, 
 you know, 
you were telling me 
 I was two-faced 
and telling me 
 that I, you know, 
betrayed you
 or whatever 
and I don't feel 
 that I have at all. 
I said, "I think I deserve 
 to get to the four 
and to get to the three." 
She said, 
 "I'm not going to let you." 
And it's the other way around--
 I'm not going to let her. 
I feel that I 
 should maybe 
deserve to get 
 into the three 
and then you guys 
 have at it. 
Well, whatever, yeah, 
but, no, I ain't going 
to let you 
into the three 
if I can 
possibly help it, 
'cause you're a threat 
to me in the end. 
We'll keep to an agreement 
that we'll treat 
 each other civil 
till the time we leave here. 
No sense to make it hard 
 on anybody. 
And while we're here, 
 possibly together for 
 the next four days... 
so let's 
 just be civil. 
I know. That's 
what I thought 
we were being-- 
very civil. 
I thought 
 we were, too. 
I just wanted to... 
 to clear that up. 
I felt that yesterday 
was a confusing thing 
and, you know, 
 whatever happens now, happens. 
That's right. Yeah. 
RICHARD: 
Check that out. 
Look at the road 
the ant highway, 
 up on the, uh, ceiling 
of the, uh, hut here. 
The canvas. 
Two-lane highway. 
You can see the ants 
 going in and out. 
Got a really 
 great view from here. 
We'll build the grill 
 when we get back. 
This is my 
 mosquito net sarong. 
This is... damn it. 
Really it's three days. 
Right, this is the 
 fourth day to the end. 
In three days, this'll be over. 
All I'm thinking now is "win." 
Do what I have to do. 
Now I'm in it to win, you know, 
and to just... just 
 be a nice guy 
and to just do this, 
 that and the other thing 
and pack it in is wrong. 
So I got to win. 
I'm going to have 
 to win immunity 
and I'll have to finagle. 
And I'm 
 going to have to try 
to pick up the vibe on people. 
If, you know, like right now, 
Sue and Kelly 
 aren't getting along. 
There might be something 
 I can exploit to my advantage. 
I might have to do 
 stuff like that. 
It's going to be a lot of work, 
 but I'll get there. 
SUSAN: 
 Yeah, I have one more 
 challenge. 
There's no rewards, 
 and you know what? 
I'm not even thinking 
I'm going to win anymore. 
I want to win the last one, 
 like, oh, man, if I win any-- 
I'm praying, I'm praying 
that I win 
 the very last immunity-- 
if I'm here, if I make it 
 through the next four, 
which I think I will. 
Oh, the mailbox 
is getting further away. 
There it is.
SUSAN: 
 A camera. 
"Last night, Jeff Probst 
went missing." 
"Last night..." 
"his camera was all that 
 was found in the jungle." 
All right, how do you 
 work the damn thing? 
So who knows how 
to play these back? 
It says "play." 
KELLY: 
Okay. What the hell's going on? 
Who saw the silly 
Blair Witch 
 Project anyway?
SUSAN: 
I did. So watch. 
This will tell us 
where he's at. 
This is... wherever 
he's marked in the jungle. 
Oh, look at the mask. 
"What is the 
immunity challenge?" 
Survivor Witch Project. 
Pagong Beach. 
Sundown. 
What was that? What was that? 
What was that? 
"Pagong Beach at sundown." 
And "What is the 
 immunity challenge?"
We get no clues.
It's tonight at Pagong 
Beach at sundown. 
That's pretty 
cool, though. 
JEFF: 
 This island is Rich with 
 tradition and superstition. 
Talk to the locals, 
 they'll tell you one thing-- 
disrespect the jungle, 
 you pay the price. 
Today's challenge deals 
 with jungle spirits. 
Each survivor will be 
 given a video camera 
and will race into the jungle 
 in search of five masks. 
Behind each one is a question 
 about island folklore. 
The castaways 
 will use the camera 
to record themselves giving the
 answers and then take the mask.
The first one 
 to collect all the masks 
and answer all five 
 questions correctly on tape 
will appease the jungle spirits
 and win immunity. 
Everything I'm about 
 to tell you is true. 
Malaysian custom says 
that sacrificing a goat 
can bring about good luck. 
So the locals seek out 
the largest Banyan tree 
 they can find 
and a high priestess 
makes the sacrifice. 
This is how you protect 
yourself in the jungle. 
The one thing you want to do 
to protect yourself is 
never call out 
somebody's name. 
According to legend, 
if you call out someone's name, 
 the tree spirits 
can grab that name and literally
 repeat that name later. 
So you're out on your own 
and you hear somebody say 
 your name-- "I'm over here." 
So you start going this way. 
So what you have to do 
if this happens-- 
you got a piece of vine, 
 you make a circle out of it, 
you step through the circle, 
you say 
your own name 
and you reclaim 
your name. 
Every Tribal Council 
 I say, "Fire represents life. 
Your identity is 
 represented by your fire." 
Since the merger, every person 
voted off the island 
has had their torch mysteriously
blown out by the wind. 
And without anyone noticing, 
we had to re-light it 
so it could be 
ceremoniously 
snuffed out instead. 
Also at Tribal Council, 
I started blowing 
 this conch shell. 
Okay. Folklore says 
that the headhunters, 
when they would 
come back from 
their headhunting, 
they would blow the conch shell
and the rain gods 
 would release a storm 
to cleanse them 
 of all their sins 
that they had committed for the 
people that they had beheaded. 
What has happened 
at every Tribal Council? 
It's rained. 
The last thing is probably 
the most beautiful thing 
about island life, 
involves snakes. 
The truth is 
that when a snake 
comes to your camp, it is 
actually bringing you good luck.
If you treat the snake 
 with respect, 
it will bring you good luck, 
 but if you disrespect 
or taunt a snake, 
it'll bring you bad luck. 
Joel can 
attest to that. 
He chased a pit viper 
 away from the Pagong camp, 
his fate was sealed. 
Later that night 
Joel was voted off the island. 
The most important 
thing right now is 
if you have listened 
carefully, 
I've given you everything 
you need to know 
to win tonight's 
immunity challenge. 
Take a camera 
and pass it down. 
Your immunity challenge 
tonight is to go into the jungle
and there 
you'll find 
five masks 
for each one of you. 
Behind each mask 
is a question. 
Take the video camera, 
point it at yourself, 
record the answer. 
When you're finished, 
 take the mask with you. 
First one back with all the 
 correct answers wins immunity. 
Let's do it. 
This is for immunity. 
Win this, you're going 
 to the final four. 
Survivors ready?
Go! 
"What is one event..." 
Their torches going out 
 at, uh, the council. 
"How can you turn the good luck 
 from a visiting snake 
 into bad luck?" 
Don't bother it, don't taunt it.
Not taunting it or anything. 
Don't taunt it, don't do 
 anything to it. That's one. 
I don't know. 
"What will the sprits do 
when they hear the conch shell?"
They'll cause it to rain 
 to cleanse the, uh... 
sins of the headhunters. 
Okay. 
Uh... say your name 
and step 
 through a hoop in vines. 
Say your name 
 and it will be all cleared up. 
"...from Tribal Council?" 
I don't know. 
"According to legend, 
 what must you do 
to respect the spirits 
 in the Banyan tree?" 
Kill a goat. 
Drain the blood from the goat. 
And then pour the blood 
 around in a circle. 
"If the spirits cause you to..."
I don't know. 
Five? 
Yeah. 
Do you have 
all the answers? 
Sure do.
Yeah? 
Let me see it. 
Four for four. 
Last one. 
I guess you get 
to keep this. 
There you go. 
SUSAN: 
 Good job, Kelly. 
Nice job, Wiglesworth. 
Congratulations.
Thanks, guys. 
SUSAN: 
 The rain's coming sideways. 
If it was coming straight down, 
we'd be over by the fire 
underneath the parachute. 
That would be good 
 over there, eh, Rudy? 
RUDY: 
Yeah. Parachute might blow away.
SUSAN: 
 I hope it's just 
 an afternoon of this, Rudy. 
I hope it's not 
 raining tonight 
when we got to march
 up to tribal. 
I don't know how Sean 
could sit up there. 
Thought he had enough of it. 
Cold and hungry. 
I'm winning this thing. 
You know, it's going to be 
 an uphill battle for me, 
but I'm winning this thing-- 
 the whole show. 
RICHARD: 
 So we're back to... 
 where we were, eh? 
We were just talking
about whether 
 it's Sean or Rudy. 
RUDY: 
 Myself and, uh, Rich 
are going right to the end. 
You know, we hope that 
 it will be us two in the end 
where the jury picks one of us. 
Yeah. It should be 
an interesting council. 
Mm-hmm. 
RICHARD: 
 The balance of power 
I don't believe has shifted 
 from me to Kelly, 
but certainly I've lost 
 some footing. 
Kelly wins immunity, 
 and all kinds of things 
have to change 
 and shift quickly. 
So it's not as easy 
 to remain a solid alliance 
in the midst of a lot of flux 
with so few people. 
KELLY: 
 Rich has said-- 
since he knows 
 that Sue was plotting 
an alliance against him-- 
he has had to rearrange 
 his strategy. 
So, maybe they're not 
 voting together. 
I don't know. 
To me, that just means game on. 
SEAN: 
 I think I've always 
 looked at it, 
the next Tribal Council, 
there'll be, you know, 
 a lot of votes cast 
in different directions 
that were never previously 
 cast before. 
I think the three people 
 that are likely to vote for Sue
are me, Richard 
 and potentially Rudy. 
Rudy's kind of swinging. 
Rudy wants to... 
 wanted me whacked 
about three weeks ago, 
so, you know... 
 he's a good guy. 
We sleep together, but he's 
 ready to slit my throat 
in this contest any minute now.
Behind... 
KELLY: 
 I'm going to vote 
 for either Rich or Sue. 
Um... it's time to get dirty. 
No more Mr. Nice Guy. 
I... as I said, I don't know. 
It's every man for himself. 
JEFF: 
 Grab a seat.
I'll bring in the jury... 
which is growing. 
Now, Greg, Jenna, 
Gervase, Colleen. 
They'll take a seat 
here to observe. 
One of you will be 
joining this group tonight. 
The other four 
 will be moving on. 
Tribal Council number 12. 
This is big tonight,
because if you make it 
 through this vote, 
you make it 
 to the final four. 
Obviously the only person 
 here doesn't have 
 to worry tonight-- 
Kelly Wiglesworth. 
Kelly, how much did you need 
 to win that immunity? 
Desperately. Desperately. 
You're convinced you 
 were gone if not? 
Pretty much, yeah. 
In the situation 
 we're in tonight, 
as a result, 
 you go from somebody 
who might well have 
 been voted off 
to the absolute 
 swing vote. 
You can't be voted on, 
but you're going 
 to vote for somebody. 
Indeed. 
Did the mood around you 
 change at all in the last day? 
I'd say so, yeah. 
I think the mood, you know... 
pretty much everybody 
with the whole group 
and the new dynamics 
and three days left 
 has changed quite a bit. 
JEFF: 
 What about you, Rich? 
What do you think 
 the take is on you 
from the American public 
 point of view. 
Hopefully, the people 
 who watch the show 
would see somebody who's kind 
of known what he was looking for
from the beginning, 
and has kind of 
worked toward 
his goal 
as ethically as he 
 could do it. 
JEFF: 
 Rudy, you been 
 around a long time. 
You're definitely the veteran 
 of this group. 
You're flying low 
under the radar. 
What do you think 
people are saying about 
 you at this point? 
Well, I know the whole 
 Atlantic fleet is saying 
"What's that old son of a... 
 doing in there?" 
You know, and, uh, 
I'll have to answer 'em 
 when I get back. 
Do you think your buddies 
 are going, "Go, Rudy!" 
Or, "I can't wait to see 
 this guy...?" 
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 They're behind me. 
They'd better be. 
Even after you said 
you liked the homo? 
Huh? 
That's a good 
 question, though. 
You've made a couple of jokes, 
 you know, that Rich 
is definitely 
 a friend, 
but you wouldn't want 
 to be seen with him 
around your buddies.
When we're done with this, 
 I'm going to shake his hand 
and hope I never see you again. 
That's it. 
Is there a sense of dread 
coming over 
 you guys 
that, you know, 
 this whole idea 
of the alliance now 
 has to be reckoned with?
Actions come into play. 
At one point, 
whether it was 
happenstance or not, 
Pagong members were 
voted off one by one. 
Now they're sitting 
across from you 
ready to say, 
"Now it's my turn." 
How's that sittin' 
 with you, Sean? 
It's sitting fine with me. 
I think the people 
 that got to know me,
got to understand me
and know where 
 I'm coming from... 
But, you know, 
like I said 
I've conducted myself 
in a different manner 
than everybody, 
 you know-- unique. 
Uh, was it smart? 
 I don't know. 
Did it make me feel good? 
 Absolutely. 
Yeah. I mean, I'm 
very comfortable 
with them judging me 
at this point. 
JEFF: 
 Last question-- Sue:
At one point 
 you said early on... 
I think, in fact, 
 it might have been to Rich... 
I'm not sure. 
One of the first few days 
here, you said, "Listen-- 
"I'm just a redneck 
 and corporate America 
isn't going 
 to play here." 
RICHARD: 
Oh, she sure did. 
But just a couple 
 of Tribal Councils ago, 
you made a pretty good case 
for the fact 
 that what goes on here 
at Survivor 
 is really no different 
than what goes on 
 in corporate America. 
 Oh, yeah. 
So my question is 
 what has won out-- 
simple Midwestern values, 
 or the harsh reality 
of corporate life? 
It ain't over with yet, 
so you can't say who's 
 won out yet, eh? 
The idea of money-- 
money makes 
 the world go round. 
Money is greed, money is 
 what everybody thrives for. 
I don't care what 
 anybody says anymore. 
Um... it's what spins us. 
It can make life 
a little bit easier. 
If you're, 
 you know, struggling, 
or whatever, 
it helps. 
Big fights, divorces happen 
 over shortages of money, 
so... a lot to be said 
 about money, Jeff. 
That's what we're talking about.
On that note... 
it's time to vote. 
Rich. 
I'm voting for Sue tonight. 
Not for any particular reason. 
She's a good friend of mine 
and will always be 
 a good friend of mine, 
but it's a self- 
 preservation maneuver 
and, uh, needed to be done. 
It was fun. 
Good luck, buddy. 
Fire definitely represents 
 life on the island. 
Across from you now, 
11 staffs. 
Another one 
 will be added 
to that 
 group tonight. 
Four of you will
 move on. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final 
and the person will be asked 
to leave the island immediately.
I'll read the votes.
"Sue." 
"Sean." 
"Sean." 
"Sean." 
You need to bring 
 me your torch. 
Maybe the jungle 
 is speaking to us. 
SEAN: 
Wow... someone snuck up 
behind me. Come on. 
It went out 
 during the vote.
No... 
The tribe has spoken, 
 the jungle has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go. 
I'll see you in a few days. 
Good-bye. 
JEFF: 
 Sean's torch went out 
during the Tribal Council. 
Since the merger, 
every person voted off 
has had their torch go out. 
You guys have made it 
 to the final four. 
We'll have a final 
 Tribal Council, 
where the jury will decide 
 who leaves this island 
with a lot 
of bragging rights 
and a lot of cash. 
You can head back to camp. 
I'll see you
 tomorrow. 
I like to think I was 
the last good person down. 
I hope that's the way 
America remembers me. 
I conducted myself 
 very well here. 
There are people 
 I genuinely like 
 on there, 
but there are some very 
um... callous, cold 
 and duplicitous people 
remaining 
 in the contest. 
Good luck, guys. 
See you later, 
America. 
It's been a blast. Bye.
