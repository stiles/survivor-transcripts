         JEFF PROBST: 
 16 Americans forced 
 to abandon ship 
in the middle 
 of the South China Sea. 
Marooned for 39 days, 
they must work together 
 to build shelter, 
find food, 
 and survive the island. 
But ultimately, it is 
 everyone for themselves. 
Every third night they will 
 hike deep into the jungle 
to take part 
 in the Tribal Council 
where they must vote one 
 of their own off the island. 
In the end, only one will remain
and will leave the island 








with $1 million in cash. 
Last week on Survivor 
the two tribes arrived 
 at separate beaches 
and began building 
 their new home. 
( whooping ) 
On Pagong Beach, trouble began 
when B.B. tried to force 
 his work ethic on the tribe. 
B.B.: 
 We got a lot of lazy people 
 if you want to know the truth. 
JOEL: 
 He's a character, man. 
I don't think he likes me much. 
We can't have lazy people. 
JEFF: 
 Over at Tagi Beach, 
the generation gap 
was also causing problems. 








KELLY: 
 He was yelling at everybody. 
He may be 72 years old 
and an ex-Navy Seal, 
but that doesn't mean 
 that this is his world. 
I don't even know 
 what "MTV" means, you know. 
I got to fit in, not them. 
You know, there's more of them 
 than there is of me. 
JEFF: 
 And stacey, the attorney, 
 attempted to organize 
the women against Rudy. 
STACEY: 
 Kelly and I get along real well
and we've been talking 
about who 
 would be best to vote off. 
We've talked to Sue about it. 
SUSAN: 
 She don't like Rudy 
 because he's too barky. 
Anybody's too barky 
 and too bossy for Stacey 
because she 
 doesn't move her ass. 
The chicks think I'm voting 
 for one person and I'm not. 
What time do we 
 got to do this at?
We've got 
 the Tribal Council tonight 
and one of us is going to leave.
RICHARD: 
 I've narrowed it down to four. 
I'm one of them. 
First person voted
 off the island... 
Sonja.
The tribe has spoken. 
Although likable and sweet, 
 Sonja was considered 
the weakest link in the tribe 
 and was first to go. 
15 are left. 
Who will be going home 
 this week? 
STACEY: 
 I'm hungry. 
I think we're all pretty hungry.
I've gone days when I've only 
 had some fruit, but... 
there's no prospect of having 
 any fruit here. It's worse. 
We got two rats, 
 primed and ready to be cooked. 
It's dire. 
RUDY: 
 These guys were talking 
 about eating a rat. 
And when I get hungry enough, 
I'll eat one, but not now. 
I'm not close to it yet. 
SEAN: 
 I'd like to catch something 
and eat something of our own, 
 and not have it be a rat. 
I'd like that a lot. 
KELLY: 
 Fishing, um... 
I think we've been doing, 
 you know, 
w-what we're supposed to do. 
 We've... 
We've collected 
 hermit crabs. 
We've put them in the traps. 
We rafted them out. 
You know, if we can just 
 catch the one fish, 
then we can use that as bait 
and we'll catch more. 
Right there. 
Right there, right there. 
STACEY: 
Yep, there it is. 
White, floatie, floatie... 
Straight ahead. 
RICHARD: 
Damn well better be fish. 
KELLY: 
Oh, my gosh. 
( humming fanfare ) 
Come on, 
fishy, baby. 
Fish are pretty stupid. 
See what? 
Bait hanging and
 nothing moving. 
Oh. 
Empty. 
These suck. 
These do suck.
We're getting there, 
 getting to know 
each other a little bit more. 
I really want to learn 
a little bit more about Stacey. 
Because, you know-- 
 I voted her off. 
She thinks it was Rudy. 
She even came up 
 to me and said 
"Yeah, I think Rudy voted 
 me off, but that's okay 
'cause he's next anyway." 
STACEY: 
 I think after the vote 
 at the Island Council 
Rudy realized that he was just 
sort of a liability to us. 
He was sitting around 
 barking orders 
and not really helping out much.
We've all seen him eating 
 extra food and just doing 
inappropriate things 
 in the kitchen. 
Like, he's leaving the knives 
 out, they're getting rusty, 
and he's opening 
 canned goods and fruit 
without asking anybody. 
I mean, we don't have 
 a lot of food here, 
so I spoke up. 
Actually, 
 Kelly, Sue and I decided 
that somebody needed 
 to say something. 
And we put all the canned goods 
 in one spot. 
We're all going to vote 
 before we open something else. 
RUDY: 
 Me and her wouldn't get along 
if we were friends 
 on the outside... 
I'd definitely avoid her. 
She's too, uh, 
prim-like, you know. 
 I mean, uh... 
after about three weeks 
 out here in this jungle, 
she's going to learn 
 a lesson, I think. 
STACEY: 
 Boards underneath 
or the support structure 
 underneath? 
B.B.: 
 How are you working 
 on your back? 
Tie that into there? 
Yeah. Tie it into here.
You think 
I'm a miracle worker? 
 Well... 
JENNA: 
 We're getting things done 
because B.B. 
 is such a great worker. 
He gets us up. 
 We're moving stuff 
this morning and everything. 
He's doing that. 
Whatever you say. 
All right. 
You've cut her 
four times. 
They're still 
too short, right? 
B.B.: 
When you get done, you're 
 gonna have to take the broom 
and sweep out this place. 
COLLEEN: 
 I mean, really, B.B. 
He's adorable. 
I mean, who doesn't want to own
the B.B. action figure? 
He's great. He's amazing. 
He's got more stories 
than anybody 
I've ever met in my life. 
I think he's a little bit out of
his element and he doesn't know 
how to fix it without being 
 a little bit aggressive. 
Ready? Careful.
Yeah. All right. 
Hold tight. 
The biggest workers are probably
Gretchen, Craig and... I can't 
 think of the lady's name 
in the pink swimming suit, 
but she, 
 she works her heart out. 
You got 
two hands, right? 
I've got two, but 
 I-I'm keeping 
myself up with one. 
GRETCHEN: 
 Work ethic 
 is a big issue to B.B. 
Regardless of their wonderful 
personality or something, 
you know, it comes down 
 to that with him. 
RAMONA: 
 You're working your butt off 
 and he doesn't like to rest. 
He's like this workaholic. 
He just wants to get it done, 
get it done, get it done, 
and, yeah, that's great 
 sometimes, 
but you can't push 
 yourself like that 
and still, you know, 
 maintain... 
I don't know. I just... 
I don't see it lasting 
 too much longer. 
What's our 
 fish situation?
Who doesn't have 
chopsticks now? 
GREG: 
 B.B., These are great. 
Yeah, they work
 really well. 
Uh-huh.
B.B. 
The only thing I ask you, 
 is take care of them 
so I don't have 
to redo this again, 
'cause after 
I make eight 
I won't remember how 
to make nine sets. 
RAMONA: 
 At this point, no one wants 
to have a confrontation 
 with him, 
so, it's like, 
 whatever B.B. says, it's like 
"Okay, B.B., yeah. 
 Whatever you want." 
And, I don't know, 
 I guess, honestly, 
if we were to ever lose 
 an immunity challenge 
I think he'd probably be 
 the first one voted off. 
RICHARD: 
 Rudy's cooking.
KELLY: 
 Oh, nice. 
Whatcha cooking, Rude?
I'm going to make 
 the rice and a papaya. 
Cool. 
Mix it... 
Beautiful. 
Do we have 
any lemon left? 
Yeah, you can put it in 
 yourself. 
RICHARD: 
Sounds awesome. 
Cook it up, Rude. 
Chef Rudy. 
We're ready whenever. 
We don't have any fish, 
but we got the traps set. 
RICHARD: 
 Rudy and I-- 
 i-it's an interesting dynamic 
because if he knew I were gay 
that would probably be really 
 difficult for him, I think. 
72 Years old, Navy vet. 
I think it would just freak him.
But, he doesn't, 
 as far as I know, know that, 
and I think he feels comfortable
 talking to me. 
I'm certainly comfortable 
talking to him. 
He's an interesting character. 
DIRK: 
There's an excellent review... 
 Self-sufficient.
on male, I mean, I know, 
you're not just homosexual. 
I know gay guys don't like 
to be called that 
'cause you're not homosexual, 
you're gay, you know. 
No. I'm homosexual. Do we not 
 not like to be called that? 
No, because it just... 
No... it's only 
 classifying people
 in sexual terms. 
SUSAN: 
 It's a lifestyle. 
Right. 
 Right. 
Well, there is a lifestyle 
associated with being gay, 
Yeah. 
 but it's not something... 
You can't say, 
 "I decided to be gay." 
But it's been interesting 
 in this new environment 
to kind of decide 
 when to say 
what about yourselves. 
I think there's 
 only one person 
you got to worry about. 
RICHARD: 
Oh, I'm not worried 
about him at all. 
As people get to know me, 
 they learn who I am 
and then eventually, over time, 
 find out I'm gay. 
I've never once in my life 
 encountered prejudice 
based on my being homosexual. 
RUDY: 
 I was big-mouthing 
 the whole time coming over here
about being with homosexuals 
 and lesbians. 
So I found out last night, 
 you know. 
When he came up here 
he said, uh, "You want to talk?"
I says, 
 "No, I don't want to talk." 
And he was going to tell me 
 he was queer then. 
The weather ain't 
going to change. 
If we went 
six degrees below. 
Where the hell 
is Borneo? 
That way? 
RUDY: 
 The homosexual, 
he's one of the nicest guys 
 I ever met 
and he's good at what he does, 
 you know. 
He's got leadership ability, 
and if these people here 
 would listen to him, 
he would take them a long way. 
But anyway, 
me and Richard got to be 
 pretty good friends-- 
not in a homosexual way, 
 that's for sure. 
Make sure you get 
this on TV. 
Oh, boy, you better have a beer 
 in your hand 
when you're doing this one, 
 Rudy. 
RUDY: 
 He's a pretty good guy. 
I don't know what my buddies 
 are going to say 
when I get home, but... 
I'll have to deal with that. 
KELLY: 
 I'm thinking we should 
 dam off a part. 
To walk over? 
Yeah, well.
Now it's, like, satiated, 
'cause I wanted papaya. 
Here. 
You don't 
want it? 
Nope. 
Well, then, 
I'll eat it. 
RAMONA: 
 I'm very, very finicky 
and as hungry as I am, 
 if I really... if I eat that 
I'm going to throw it up. 
And I'd rather them eat it 
and be able to swallow it 
 and digest it 
than me to waste it, so... 
I'll just drink water, 
 try to compensate. 
Ramona's hurting big-time. 
I feel bad for her, 
 'cause she wants so hard 
to, you know, get into the mix 
 of things and help out 
and do her job, do her part, 
but she's just not feeling well.
JENNA: 
 You all right,
 Ramona? 
( coughing ) 
( coughing ) 
GRETCHEN: 
 I don't think 
 this is what she expected. 
I don't think she'd ever quit. 
I think she doesn't even want 
 to admit 
that she's laying down a lot, 
but, um, I think it's only 
because she doesn't want to say 
that she can't be successful 
 at something, 
'cause I think she... 
 I think at home 
she's very successful 
 at what she does. 
B.B.: 
 Well... 
I think the work-ethic problem 
is-- doesn't ever change. 
The people who work are working 
and the people who rest 
 are resting and that's... 
that's the way it is about 80, 
 85% of the time. 
The laziest person is Ramona. 
I mean, she just doesn't 
 contribute anything. 
She probably hasn't worked 
 ten or 15 minutes in five days.
She's really a drag 
 because she drinks our water, 
takes our... eats our food 
and takes room in the hutch. 
GERVASE: 
 He's such a hard worker. 
If you're not working 
 as hard as him 
you're not working hard. 
I think it's just that simple. 
I feel everybody's been pulling
 their weight here. 
Nobody's been slacking. 
I mean, people have been sick. 
People have been hurting 
and I don't expect them to work.
GREG: 
 B.B.'s a good guy. 
He's pretty strong-willed 
 and he's got his plan as well. 
He's caring. 
 He demands respect. 
Definitely feels the difference
between his age and other people
and doesn't seem to want 
 to bridge that gap 
as much as just be who he is. 
We're probably about five 
 or six minutes away 
from a delicious breakfast. 
GRETCHEN: 
You know, B.B., 
throw a lot more water in there.
You guys are like 
backseat cooks. 
RAMONA: 
 You're a backseat 
 everything, 
so don't be 
 throwing stones.
I think they find me, probably, 
 abrasive, authoritarian. 
There's probably a couple 
 of other adjectives 
you could throw in there 
 that would probably work, too. 
When you get to be 64 years old 
I'll let you give 
 all the orders, okay? 
I won't make 
 it that long. 
B.B. 
 I don't care. 
I'm not trying to win 
 a personality contest. 
I just want to make my life here
as comfortable as possible 
and then get the hell off. 
It's really no problem. 
It's just like
 walking across
a log in the river.
Oh, yeah. 
RAMONA: 
 Well, the whole 
 Colleen-and-Greg thing-- 
I don't know what's going on, 
 what's not going on, 
but I kind of noticed 
 like a couple of times 
they went off for fruit 
 or whatever. 
GREG: 
 Colleen and I share 
a similar way of looking 
at everything that's happening. 
Don't smile on swampie there. 
COLLEEN: 
 Greg is great. 
It's just good 
 to have a friend, you know. 
Sometimes, when you come 
to a country-- 
 a foreign country-- 
a lot of times 
 you're really nervous 
about all the mysteries 
 that are there. 
You know, 
 you hear about malaria. 
You hear about this, 
 you hear about that. 
Those aren't worms; 
 those are leeches. 
What? 
 Nothing. 
COLLEEN: 
 Like him, 
 walking around barefoot 
and picking up things 
 and whatever, 
you feel a lot more comfortable,
and the place becomes 
 more your home. 
( Colleen chuckling ) 
Come on over 
this way. 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, this is so fun. 
GREG: 
 She's really fun to play with 
because she's fun, energetic. 
Oh, yeah. 
She's, uh, rough and ready. 
It's just, like, I'm actually 
making a friend out here, 
which I didn't think 
 was really possible. 
RAMONA: 
 Greg and Colleen-- 
 they had disappeared again. 
And we were, like, 
 where are they? 
I mean, they were gone 
 for, like, an hour. 
You know, they come back 
 and we had no idea 
where they'd gone, 
 what they'd done, 
until that night, 
 you know, they were like 
"Okay, we're going 
 to have game night." 
And we played the All-new 
 Newly Stranded Survivor game. 
( hooting and hollering ) 
GREG: 
Today, we're going to play 
the All-new Newly Stranded game.
( cheering ) 
RAMONA: 
 Basically, it was kind of like 
 a newlywed game. 
Team one was Gretchen and B.B. 
Team two was myself, 
 Jenna and Gervase, 
and then, the third team 
 was Colleen and Joel. 
If you were to describe your 
 favorite lovemaking position 
as a food, 
um, which food would that be 
 and why? 
Oh... 
Dude! Answer 
the question! 
I'm thinking, like, 
good and plenty. 
I don't know. 
( shrieks )
Excellent. 
RAMONA: 
 And so, of course, 
 Greg was the host 
and he's just so wacky. 
I love this guy. 
Like, no matter what, 
 he will have you laughing 
at least, like, 
 five times a day. 
( laughing ) 
And completely unpalatable. 
That is such a relief 
 to have somebody there 
that's, like, the icebreaker. 
GREG: 
 Onto our next category, then. 
Did you sleep last night 
worrying about this thing? 
I mean, I got 
 reason to worry.
GRETCHEN: 
 When we first got here, 
 we started arguing, B.B. and I,
about where to put the shelter 
 and I thought it should be 
up in the canopy, you know, 
out of the sun 
and with some protection, 
and he thought it should be 
 down on the beach. 
B.B.: 
Idle water won't hurt us. 
GRETCHEN: 
 This morning we woke up 
and we saw that the moon 
 was not yet full 
and high tide came 
 almost to our doorstep. 
B.B.: 
 This is going to
 be a breakwater.
I want to get down there 
 far enough to where 
the waves will come up over it 
 and start dumping sand. 
One, two, three.
B.B.: 
I already had my end up on two. 
We started bringing logs down 
and keep the waves 
 from breaking on the hut 
'cause it's going 
to wash away the support posts, 
and so he admitted 
 that maybe I was right 
about putting it back further, 
 he said 
but he still doesn't 
want it up in the canopy. 
Said he never will sleep 
 up there, so... 
All right, 
 hold it, Greg.
Right in there. 
We're right in. 
All the way over now. 
Walk straight in 
 towards the hutch.
Damn it. Walk 
 straight in. 
Okay, stop. 
Put it down. 
 Put it down. 
( screams ) 
Okay, steady. 
No, no, no. Everybody,
 let's don't rush this.
B.B.: 
 But I think that's 
 the way it ought to be.
Well, you can 
 disagree without being smart. 
Well, how many times 
do we have to say it? 
I know; that's
 not right. 
Well, it may not be that right, 
but how many times we got 
 to say-- make those decisions? 
B.B., I thought we were 
going to double up... 
We did. 
 We doubled up 
off three feet.
That's not going 
to do it. 
Yes, it will. 
JOEL: 
 You know, if the sky was blue 
and I said it was blue 
he'd say it was red 
 just to disagree. 
I can't let it 
 bring me down anymore. 
If we're building a health gym, 
 a health facility, 
I'll let you 
do it. 
So, if we're going
 to have kids, 
 that's my job. 
What does 
that mean? 
I mean, remarks
 like that do 
 not help. 
He makes 
 all of these great promises 
and-and of what 
 he's going to do, 
like catch fish 
 and do everything else. 
He has not performed one thing 
 he said he'd do. 
He reminds me of a guy that 
when you buy him 
 for what he's worth 
and sell him 
 for what he thinks he's worth, 
you'd make $1 million. 
I meant 
 significant water.
GREG: 
 Well, I think 
 they knock heads. 
B.B.'s very strong-willed 
 and Joel is as well. 
They don't back down 
 from one another 
and that causes 
 a bit of friction-- 
a bit of chafing if you want 
to put it in island terms. 
We got a float. 
I'm definitely catching 
a fish today. 
Sea bass or salmon 
or whatever the hell 
 we can get out of this ocean. 
Fish is a priority right now. 
Fish is very much a priority. 
Now that we have the fire, we 
 need something to cook it in. 
Hey, where's super pole? 
This is so super pole. 
Look at this-- 
I got the man's grip. 
Where's your hook?
We're working-- 
it's right underneath. 
This sinker's a free-floating 
float and all I do 
is I take the line out, 
line out, 
cast home 
that super pole. 
Then I reel in 
the big one. 
Not too shabby. 
SUSAN: 
 Sean sits there for five hours 
 and builds a super pole 
and doesn't catch anything 
 with it. 
SEAN: 
 Been fishing all day today 
 and still nothing. 
I don't even get a nibble. 
So that's, you know, 
 really dissatisfying. 
Get anything, Stacey? 
No. 
SUSAN: 
 I told him 
 it was a waste of time. 
"Oh, no, it's not 
 a waste of time." 
"Did you catch any fish?" 
"No." 
RICHARD: 
 He's, um, really 
wanting to get fish. 
Hadn't been able to bring any 
 in, and I think that was 
really starting 
 to eat at him. 
Maybe the area's overfished 
 or something. 
We'll figure it out 
 sooner or later. 
( chuckling ) 
( indistinct talking ) 
You washing your clothes
 in our food container? 
He's washing 
his clothes 
in freshwater. 
He's washing his clothes 
with the canteen water? 
Yeah. 
 It's unbelievable, man. 
JOEL: 
 When we get back, we're going 
 to make some rice, we're happy.
First thing he does 
 is he washes his T-shirt 
in the kettle we're going 
 to cook the rice in. 
Every canteen was empty 
and the sun's going down. 
It's starting to rain. 
When are we going 
 to get water, you know? 
You think I have time 
to go now? 
No. 
I wasn't sure I'd have time, 
so it's stupid to go up there. 
There's places 
 where you can, you know, 
it's wet now 
 'cause it was raining 
and you can barely walk. 
She's a little upset, too,
that... 
The freshwater for some 
cleansing supplies. 
Yeah. 
I thought we would
 discuss this 
from the beginning.
Before anybody
 does anything,
 we got to vote
on whatever 
 we're doing.
Now that's a 
 canteen of water. 
But you can't 
 just do that. 
We can't go back 
to the water hole tonight 
because we'll get lost. 
I don't mind. I'll go. 
No, we can't. 
It's getting dark 
and it's raining. 
...then you're hurt.
 Why? 
If you get hurt, 
 then we all lose. 
But that's not
 the point. 
B.B.: 
I'm not going to get hurt 
 if I go after water. 
B.B., please. B.B. 
It is not about "I." 
It's about us. 
I'm not arguing. 
You're missing 
the whole point. 
You're the one 
 who brought it up. 
I didn't say a word. 
You know, if that 
was your canteen 
that's cool. 
There you go. 
I don't even know 
 if that's cool, 
because if you get dehydrated 
and we have to compete, 
 we all lose. 
I'm not imposing my... 
You can't do anything here 
 without everybody agreeing.
We all have to agree 
 what we're going to do.
That's the whole thing.
I've been working my ass off 
and the lot of you have been 
laying on your ass watching me, 
so don't give me 
any of that ... 
Everyone's been
 working their 
 ass off. 
Bull ... 
Bull ... 
Hey, we've 
 all been working. 
I've worked 20 times 
as much as you. 
I'm not faulting you, 
but when you start getting 
on my ass about working... 
That's what you think.
You didn't take one trek
 in this jungle yet. 
Your ass has been 
 sitting down here 
 chillin'. 
GERVASE: 
 If B.B. thinks anybody 
 on our tribe is slacking, 
the heat is affecting him. 
Everybody on our tribe 
 is working hard. 
I mean, everybody 
 has different jobs. 
Building the shelter 
 is probably the hardest job. 
He took that challenge on 
so somebody going out there 
trying to catch some fish 
might not look that important, 
but it's just as important. 
I didn't want this 
 to turn into this. 
It's going to turn
 into this. 
You knew it was. 
 I mean, there's no 
 other way around it.
This is the meeting
we needed to have. 
You can't be making decisions 
 on your own. 
I'll try to at least get 
 all eight of us here for this, 
and then we'll talk. 
I'm going after water. 
B.B.: 
 I'm not voting 
 when I wash my clothes. 
No one's going to tell me 
 when I can do stuff like that. 
First place, 
 this is not a democracy. 
I'll vote on things 
 that don't matter, 
but things that matter, uh, 
 and my survival... 
and... my comfort, 
 I'm not going to vote. 
Throughout their time 
 on the island 
the tribes will compete 
in a series of challenges. 
They'll receive messages 
 notifying them 
of these competitions 
 at their tree mail. 
Lose, face Tribal Council 
 where you must vote 
one member off the island. 
You did? 
We got something. 
( chuckles ) 
Info, info. 
"You've been cordially invited 
 to the first annual 
"Starving Survivor's Buffet. 
"The meal will feature 
 local delicacies 
"and will be served al fresco 
in the shadow of the banyan tree
along the Lari-Lari trail." 
Oh, gosh, this is about 
 eating disgusting things! 
Oh! Can you imagine?! 
I bet you're right. 
Eating disgusting things. 
( groans )
I don't know. 
I'm going to pull out 
 some of the maps. 
Eating bugs.
 We're going 
to be eating some bugs tonight. 
Come on, man. I love bugs. 
I know you do.
Huh?
RUDY: 
 "And will be served al fresco 
in the shadow of the banyan tree
 along the Lari-Lari trail." 
Hmm, sounds tasty. 
Oh, I'll swallow everything. 
You won't even eat rice.
What are you talking about?
This is for immunity. 
 That's different. 
Let's have a little
 strategy meeting 
for the immunity
 challenge. 
Okay. 
I think we ought
 to consider how 
we're going to do it. 
Whether we even
 want to win it.
'Cause I think... 
Yes, we want 
to win it. 
No, I want 
 to talk about it
'cause I think 
 we ought to think 
about lightening
 the load here. 
I'm not going to quit, 
but if I can engineer 
an escape route for myself 
and do it right, do it ethically
 and do it correctly, 
then, sure, I'll do it. 
I don't agree with that... 
with quitting or engineering 
 something just to save face. 
I think he's trying 
 to save face 
before getting voted off 
because I don't think 
 he would have come here 
if that was the case. 
What's the point of coming 
 all this way, 
going through all the crap 
we had to go through 
 to get here, 
for you to all of a sudden 
 decide 
that you want to get voted off.
B.B., you can put 
 up with this 
for a little longer.
The name of the game 
is to reduce the tribe. 
The name of the game
 is to stay together 
as long as you can.
Yeah, to survive. 
To survive.
Sometimes strategy-wise, 
it might be best. 
You have a chance 
 to go, everyone. 
Oh, I understand that, 
but I'm just saying 
I think we ought to 
at least decide 
what we want to do. 
We want to win.
Win.
Then the subject's closed. 
JEFF: 
 This is the immunity idol. 
The tribe holding the idol 
does not have to hike 
 to Tribal Council 
and vote one of their own 
 off the island. 
The Pagong Tribe won 
 last week's immunity challenge 
"Quest for Fire." 
We're just not going 
 to let this out! 
JEFF: 
 Win today's challenge, 
 win the idol 
and immunity from tonight's 
 Tribal Council. 
Yeah, baby!
( all cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 Welcome.
Yeah! 
 Right on! 
Thank you.
Grab a seat, guys.
How's it going?
Pagong, thanks 
 for bringing back 
 the immunity idol.
It's up for grabs again. 
Losing tribe, 
you know the drill. 
You go to Tribal Council, 
one of your members 
 gets voted off, 
not a fun place to go. 
I know you guys probably 
 been six days without food. 
So, I went out, 
 I looked long and hard 
to find a true local delicacy. 
And we turned it 
 into an immunity competition, 
so let me just give you 
 a visual. 
Oh, God. 
Gross!
Yeah. In Borneo, 
 this is considered
 like sushi. 
( cheering and groaning ) 
Everybody, just take one. 
These will swim away. 
Gerv's going to
 have to eat it!
JEFF: 
 Put it on 
 your plate
and don't let 
 it crawl away.
They're called,
 uh, "puton." 
These are just 
beetle larvae. 
That's all they are. 
I didn't want to know that. 
I was better not knowing. 
Aw! Yeah, yeah, 
yeah, yeah! 
B.B.: 
Aw, look at 
that thing go. 
( loud groan ) 
JEFF: 
 Okay, the rules of the game 
are simple: 
The first person 
 who refuses to eat a bug 
loses immunity for their tribe. 
Lose immunity, your tribe 
 must vote one of its members 
off the island 
 at tonight's Tribal Council. 
Guys, bon appetit. 
Not the head? 
Bite the head off. 
Just hold it by the head 
 and take and bite it. 
But get all 
 of it, Gervase.
Don't just get the tail. 
SUSAN: 
Yeah, I wouldn't 
eat the head, man. 
RICHARD: 
 Yeah, Dirk.
SUSAN: 
Yeah, Dirk! 
Come on!
COLLEEN: 
Come on, Gervase! 
JENNA: 
Eat it! 
COLLEEN: 
Go, Dirk. 
JENNA: 
We're doing it 
for the what, Gervase? 
( all yelling ) 
Keep going.
Keep going.
RAMONA: 
Put it in your mouth! 
Put it 
in your mouth! 
( Gervase yells ) 
GRETCHEN: 
Quick! Come on, quick! 
JENNA: 
Gervase! 
COLLEEN: 
Gervase, 
you've got it. 
Come on, man. 
I can't do it! 
GREG: 
Stay focused, guys. 
Don't think 
about it. 
JENNA: 
Close your eyes. 
Close your eyes. 
Can we bite the
 head off first?
( groaning ) 
I can't do it! 
If you've been 
 to Chinese restaurants, 
you've eaten worse; 
 they're just smaller. 
( groans ) 
Grab it by the head 
and stick it in your mouth. 
One! 
Two! 
I can't do it! 
Gervase! 
 Ew! 
Yuck, yuck, yuck, 
 yuck, yuck, yuck! 
JEFF: 
 Gervase, I'm going
 to count to five--
countdown 
 from five.
Oh, Gervase, 
if you lose... 
Starting now. 
Prepare yourself. 
Here comes the count. 
Five...
four...
three...
two...
I'm going to do it! 
One...
Yes! Yeah! 
Yes! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
( cheering and groaning ) 
RAMONA: 
He swallowed it! 
He swallowed it! 
JEFF: 
 Even up. We're moving 
 down next door. 
Gretchen and Sean. 
Jeff. 
JEFF: 
You're good. 
Nice work.
Ow! Yeah! 
( cheering ) 
Yeah, baby. 
Eat it whole, 
you guys. 
There you go, 
 come on. 
SEAN: 
There you go, 
big man. 
Ah, gone. 
Wow. 
I'm chewing. 
JEFF: 
Water's right there 
in the pitcher. 
Hey, Richard. 
Come on, baby. 
Can we take 
the head off now? 
JEFF: 
 I'm going to come down 
 there and check, though.
I don't want to...
 All right. 
All right, Greg.
GRETCHEN: 
 It's like chicken.
JEFF: 
 Yeah, hold them 
 up for me, okay.
Let me see that.
( laughter ) 
Oh... 
GERVASE: 
 Good one, 
 Colleen. 
JEFF: 
 Hit it, Sue. 
GERVASE: 
 Yeah, baby!
JEFF: 
 B.B., let me see you, here. 
( cheering ) 
( whooping ) 
Great. Well, 
 I kind of anticipated 
you might enjoy this, 
so we have a tie-breaker round. 
Pagong, you can pick 
who you perceive to be 
 their most squeamish member, 
the member least likely 
 to want to eat. 
Tagi, you pick their 
 most squeamish member, 
the person you think... 
I think Gervase. 
STACEY: 
 You know what,
maybe they're 
 faking us out.
Pick him. 
JOEL: 
Gervase will go. 
He's a team player. 
Pagong, who're you guys 
 going with? 
RAMONA: 
I think Stacey. 
STACEY:
 Okay. 
So, is that your choice? 
Stacey and Gervase? 
Okay, Stacey, come down here 
 and switch places with Dirk. 
COLLEEN: 
Come on, Gervase! 
RICHARD: 
 Go, Stacey, baby. 
 It's up to you, baby. 
All right. 
You guys ready? 
Yeah. 
You ready? 
I want to make 
 the rules very clear--
each reach in 
 and grab two of these. 
You'll wash them in that bowl; 
 you'll put them in your bowl. 
When I tell you to go, you go. 
First one done with both 
 wins immunity for their team. 
Here we go-- grab two each 
and wash them off. 
Yeah. 
 You got it.
Here you go, guys.
I liked it before. 
Shall we eat 
 at the same time? 
Ahh! 
Come on, baby. 
 KELLY: 
 Stace! 
We'll all do it 
 at the same time. 
COLLEEN: 
Immunity, Gervase. 
It's all about 
immunity. 
B.B.: 
Come on! 
JEFF: 
 We're not going yet. 
I'm going to say, 
 "Three, two, one, eat." 
You grab on "eat." 
Get your hands down 
 at your waist. 
DIRK: 
 Here we go, Stace.
JOEL: 
Close your eyes 
and kill them, man. 
JEFF: 
 Here we go, guys: 
Three, two, one. Eat! 
Go, Gervase, go! 
Go, Gervase! 
SEAN: 
 Swallow!
Open! 
( cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 Tagi! 
Yes! 
Hey, guys.
Whoo! 
DIRK: 
 All right!
Wow. 
Good. 
DIRK: 
 Stacey!
 Stacey!
Good job, man.
Man, I just got
 some protein! 
RICHARD: 
 Nice bug-eating.
( whooping ) 
SEAN: 
 Stacey thinks she can 
 do anything just like I do, 
and she really did her own. 
I think what really 
 pulled her through 
was eating those two bugs 
in lightning speed, 
 because I think 
she impressed a lot people, 
 pulled her own weight. 
I think that's when she finally
 got accepted amongst the girls.
JEFF: 
 Unfortunately, you guys 
are coming 
to Tribal Council tonight. 
And I'll just want to give you 
a little advance warning: 
It is a long walk. 
It's a walk through the jungle, 
 in the dark. 
Bring some sticks. 
Tagi ran into a lot of snakes. 
Here's a map, follow it. 
Uh, tonight, you will have 
to vote one member 
 of your team off. 
You can head back. 
? ? 
( bird whistling ) 
RAMONA: 
 Tribal council-- 
it's kind of like... 
judgment day on Earth, kind of, 
and that's-that's 
 like so daunting. 
You're like, "Whoa." 
I mean, you have to stand 
in judgment of your maker, 
and in this case, of, like, 
 your fellow tribe members. 
? ? 
My length of stay 
 on the island depends 
on either what, like, 
 somebody thinks of me 
or what they don't think of me 
 or of my abilities. 
I'm not exactly a control freak,
but I kind of like to be 
 in control of things, 
and I have no control 
over whether I stay or go. 
My vote would be 
 I would vote Ramona off 
because B.B. is 
such a great wor... gets us up. 
He... We're moving stuff 
 this morning and everything. 
I mean, 
we're getting things done 
because B.B.'s there, too. 
He's doing that. 
As soon as we had breakfast, 
Ramona was back in bed. 
I think it's, uh, likely 
B.B. will be 
 the first one voted off. 
I think he pretty much... 
 he dug his own grave. 
Now he's saying he wants to go.
So, if that's what he wants, 
 that's fine. 
B.B.: 
 The first two people 
 that I would consider voting 
out of here, besides myself, 
 would be, uh... 
Joel and, uh... Ramona. 
If I get voted off,
 I'll give you this 
and you wear it
 as a tube top. 
All right, good, yeah... 
and I'm leaving my beach towel. 
GRETCHEN: 
 Even though we've only known 
each other 
 for such a short time 
I think we-we've bonded already.
I think that's how everybody 
 was feeling. 
Some people, you know, 
 showed it 
and some people didn't. 
I'm going to take my
 chopsticks with me. 
Maybe somebody needs chopsticks.
I can sell them on the side 
and make a little 
extra money. 
( chuckles )
You know? 
( mumbles ) 
Huh?
B.B.: 
 They got to think long and hard
 before they vote me out 
because I think 
 I contribute a lot. 
If Gretchen or I 
 would leave this tribe, 
that'd be like 
 dropping an atomic bomb here. 
? ? 
( waves crashing ) 
JEFF: 
 This is Tribal Council, 
where each week, one member 
 will be voted off the island. 
Pagong must now make 
 the dreaded hike 
to the Tribal Council. 
Despite their initial successes,
the tribe is in turmoil. 
B.B.'s butting heads 
 with the rest of the tribe, 
Ramona has been ill, 
 and their shelter 
is in danger 
 of being washed away. 
Soon we'll find out 
 if losing a member 
is what is needed 
 to bring this tribe together. 
( birds chirping ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( gong sounds ) 
( birds singing ) 
We begin Tribal Council 
 with the ritual. 
Behind each of you is a torch. 
I'd like you to grab the torch 
and approach the fire. 
Go ahead and dip 
 your torches in, 
and once they're lighted, 
put them back in their slots 
and have a seat. 
We do this because-- 
as I'm sure you've figured out--
on the island, 
fire represents life. 
These torches now represent 
 your life, your identity 
here at Tribal Council, 
and you will bring them back 
with you to each council. 
Go ahead and have a seat. 
Well, having made the, uh, trek 
from your guys' camp to here, 
 I know what a long one it is-- 
monitor lizards, snakes-- 
but it's not by accident 
the Tribal Council is located 
 in the center of the jungle. 
What happens here is sacred, 
 needs to be respected. 
The way you've handled yourself 
 will either come back 
to help you, 
or it may come back 
 to haunt you, 
but those actions 
 will play a part 
as we'll find out tonight. 
If you look over here, 
you'll see the only 
unlit staff on this ruin. 
That represents Sonja-- 
the first person 
 voted off the island. 
Tonight, one of you 
will have your flame 
 extinguished, 
and you will go home. 
It's tough, but that's 
 the nature of Tribal Council, 
the way it's set up. 
So, before we get to the vote, 
Colleen, what was your take 
on what went down in terms 
of who stepped forward 
 to take the reins? 
I mean, 
I think we have 
two or three strong leaders 
in our group, definitely, 
and they took, uh... 
they guided the rest of us 
into, uh, doing the right things
and getting everything done. 
I mean, we have 
a great place now, 
thanks to them, I think. 
Gervase, what are you 
 feeling right now 
first time at Tribal Council, 
knowing what you're going 
 to have to do tonight? 
I-I just feel bad. 
You know, I kind of feel 
 like I let my team down 
by, uh... not winning, 
 but, uh... 
I mean, that's-that's 
really about it, you know. 
I-I just wish 
 we kicked their butt. 
Didn't happen that way, 
 you know, but... 
JEFF: 
 Jenna, you've been
 a little bit 
of a cheerleader
 for the group. 
So, how does this play for you, 
coming over here, 
 having to vote one person off? 
It's unfair. 
We've really bonded, 
 so to kick one of us off 
is like losing a family member, 
and then it's going to be 
a large, empty gap 
 in the bed tonight. 
All right.
Let me explain 
 how the voting works. 
One by one, starting with B.B., 
 you come along here, 
go across 
 this bridge
into our voting
 confessional. 
There's a piece of paper. 
You need to write the name 
of the person 
 you're voting off 
in large, clear
 block letters. 
Hold it up.
Speak your piece. 
All right.
It's time to vote. 
B.B., you're up. 
? ? 
B.B.: 
 Uh, I think that 
 this, uh, person contributed 
probably the least of anyone 
 in all of our efforts. 
? ? 
I chose B.B. 'cause he was like 
 a get-out-of-jail-free card. 
He said that he was ready to go,
and he'd done 
 what he came to do, 
and he might not have been 
 my first choice 
if he wasn't ready to go home, 
because he certainly 
 is a hard worker 
and he kicked some butt. 
? ? 
I think it's time 
 for Ramona to go. 
She's a strong challenger, 
 but it seems like she, uh... 
she doesn't want to be 
 a part of the... 
or is struggling with being 
 part of the group life 
that we have there. 
? ? 
Uh, I voted him off 
 because he's about 
the only choice 
 we had right now. 
Uh, we all talked 
 about other ones, but, uh... 
right now, 
he's just the best choice 
because we have to win 
 the next competitions. 
Unfortunately, we had to do it. 
Sorry, man. 
? ? 
JEFF: 
Well, obviously, there are a lot
of reasons 
 why you guys are here. 
$1 million, enough reason 
 probably for anybody, 
and I'm sure 
 there are some of you 
who may have different reasons 
 or additional reasons. 
Regardless, to achieve your goal
you have to survive 
tonight's Tribal Council. 
One of you won't. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Before I read the votes, 
I just want to say that 
once the decision has been made,
it is final. 
I'll guide you through this, 
but you'll be asked 
to leave the island immediately.
No good-byes. 
All right, 
 let's count the votes. 
First vote: "B.B." 
"Ramona." 
"B.B." 
"Ramona." 
That's two votes for Ramona, 
 two votes for B.B. 
"B.B." 
"B.B." 
"B.B." 
The last vote 
 is irrelevant.
B.B., I need to have
 you grab your torch 
and bring it to me.
Go ahead and 
 slide over here.
B.B., the tribe
 has spoken. 
It's time 
 for you to go.
All right. 
Good-bye. 
JEFF: 
 To the rest of you, 
 uh, congratulations. 
You survived 
your first Tribal Council. 
Not a fun process, 
but one you'll have to do again.
You can take your torches 
 and head back to camp. 
? ? 
Next week on Survivor: 
My testimony is not something 
 I'm afraid to share. 
When Christ came, 
he opened the door 
 to every human being. 
I can only take 
 so much preaching. 
Dirk's about driving me wild 
 with that. 
The "oomph" is a little gone. 
I think that not eating 
 is a factor of our mood. 
I'm so ready to eat rat. 
I want to gut him, bone him 
 and... 
Surf and turf. 
Minnows and rats. 
I'm a little sad 
 to leave these people 
because after the last six days,
you know, we've gotten 
 pretty close, all of us. 
There isn't anybody 
 in that group I don't like. 
Some I like more than others, 
 but that's normal. 
And I hope that I showed them 
 a little bit of work ethic; 
that I don't back off 
 from-from what I did. 
I think what I did 
 was the right way.
