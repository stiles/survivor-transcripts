         JEFF PROBST: previously on
Survivor...
 Oh, my god.
I feel like my finger is about
to fall off.
 PROBST: Parvati put herself
on the chopping block.
 You can see where the finger
is actually separated.
 PROBST: At the reward
challenge...








 Stacy, come on out.
 PROBST: ...the tribe got a
taste of home.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Then the survivors and their
loved ones competed together.
 Is that good?
 Keep going!
 PROBST: Despite her injury,
Parvati and her father
prevailed.
Parvati wins reward!
 Jonathan.








 PROBST: And Jonathan was sent
to Exile Island.
Sundra, Adam, and their loved
ones joined Parvati and her dad
on a true Cook Islands
adventure.
 I haven't had fresh water in
32 days.
It was so cool and refreshing.
It felt so good.
 PROBST: When the winners
returned bearing gifts...
 We had extra food.
 Oh, my god!
 PROBST: ...the tribe bonded.
 People seem more chilled out
if we're just our six without
Jonathan, so it's sort of nice
that he's on Exile right now.
 PROBST: At the challenge,
immunity was in the balance.
Ozzy having no trouble.
Ozzy very close.
And Ozzy once again shut
everyone out.
Ozzy wins immunity!
Ozzy was safe.
 Why not have me or Parvati in
the fifth spot as opposed to
Jonathan?
 PROBST: And with the hidden
immunity idol still in his
possession, Yul was in a
position of power.
 They're going to say anything
they can, because if you fall
for it then I'm gone, and
they're still around waiting to
take you guys out.
 I feel like I'm, like, the
godfather or something,
arranging a hit on somebody.
 PROBST: At tribal council...
 No one wants Jonathan around.
 PROBST: Jonathan took another
beating.
 There are six good people out
here that really deserve to be
here.
 Why don't I deserve to be
here?
 Just your integrity.
You don't have any.
 PROBST: And Adam and Parvati
were spared.
The 14th person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury.
Jonathan, the tribe has spoken.
 And I'd like my hat back at
some point.
 PROBST: Six are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
 Jonathan's not here.
 He was like, "I want my hat
back."
 Parvati and I feel good about
Jonathan being voted off.
You know, I just feel better now
that I'm in the game and
Jonathan's not, because, you
know, he was just a nuisance at
this point.
I want to stay in the game
however I can, as long as
possible, and try to crack the
armor of those four.
 I know.
I think Adam and I know that our
position of power right now is
very limited.
We are in a weak spot.
It's going to take a lot of
smooth talking to try to get
them to, you know, open their
eyes.
I have to put it in a way like
it doesn't seem like they're
betraying their old tribe.
And that's going to be very
difficult, because I know that
they all are fiercely loyal to
each other right now, and me and
Adam are on the outside.
People are going to have to
start turning on each other.
 Exactly.
Yeah, I know.
 We're the underdogs.
We've got to fight.
 I know.
We are.
We've got to try.

 Tree mail!
 What does it say?
 What's that?
 Is that mud?
 It's a bucket of mud.
All right.
"Again you will bust out your
swimwear.
It's not a shame to be dirty.
Today you better be proud.
You could be eating and sleeping
in splendor while the others
will just get by.
To earning rejuvenation, here's
mud in your eye."
We just got our tree mail, and
we're wondering if it's going to
be, like, the naked mud
wrestling competition or
something crazy.
Something muddy.
 Yep.
 And the reward sounds great.
It sounds like you'll be eating
and sleeping in splendor.
So I think we're all pretty
excited by it.
 I mean, it's... we've got to
do it.
 At this point, it's extremely
important for me or Adam to win
this challenge because if not,
Adam is going to exile.
We're the underdogs.
 Yeah.
 The four of the Aitu tribe is
very tight, so I'm sure they
won't be sending any of each
other to exile.
You know, so that's the plan.
We've got to make it happen.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Time to get dirty.
Ready to get to today's
challenge?
 Yeah.
 Ready!
 PROBST: For today's reward
challenge, are you going to dive
into a mud pit and cover your
body with as much mud as you
can, then race back and scrape
it off into a bucket.
You cannot carry mud in your
arms or your hands.
You can only use your body.
The person with the most mud in
their bucket at the end of ten
minutes wins reward.
Want to know what you're playing
for?
 Yeah!
 PROBST: The winner of today's
challenge will be indulging in a
luxury spa reward.
You'll have a massage, pool,
wash your clothes.
You'll have a bed, because
you're spending the night.
And you will gorge on food.
 Oh!
 PROBST: Plenty of dessert.
Plus beer, wine, and champagne.
 Oh, Jeff!
You're killing me, Jeff!
 PROBST: With six days left,
this could be what you need to
get you through the rest of this
adventure.
Worth playing for?
 Yeah!
 PROBST: In addition, the
winner of this challenge will
send one person to Exile Island.
One other element-- the winner
of this challenge will be joined
by two people on this reward.
Those two people will be the
second and third-place
finishers.
 Oh, wow.
 All right!
 PROBST: Sound good?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.
Here we go, for reward.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Ozzy hurdles the hitching post.
Everybody in the mud.
What strategy will you use to
get the mud back?
You can put mud on your heads.
Make sure you're not carrying
mud in your hands.
Adam coming back with mud.
Yul coming back.
Ozzy coming back.
Yul covered in mud, getting all
of it off.
You have ten minutes to get as
much mud as you can in your
bucket.
Top three going on reward.
Yul heading back out.
Ozzy right behind.
Ozzy back in the mud.
Adam back in the mud.
Yul coming back with a second
load of mud.
Adam right behind.
Yul doing the back, using the
trough of his back to carry mud.
Becky using her hair, squeezing
as much mud out as she can.
Parvati loading up her chest,
trying to keep it up there
without carrying it.
Adam's just using his long legs,
scraping them off.
Ozzy got a nice load on his
hair.
Can he keep it?
He does, through the hitching
post.
That's a lot of mud in that
bucket.
Like watching bad performance
art.
Ozzy heading back out for more
mud.
Two minutes left.
Everybody squeezing as much off
as they can.
Ozzy loading up the back of his
neck.
He's going to try and cradle it
back there.
Yul heading back out.
Ozzy has a lot of mud with a big
lead after that.
One minute left.
Yul coming back once again
carrying it on his back.
And it works.
30 seconds left!
This is going to be it.
Parvati making a go of it with a
ton of mud on her head.
That could move Parvati up.
Ozzy coming back with more mud.
Ozzy's bucket's nearly full.
20 seconds.
Yul getting everything he can
off his body.
15.
Parvati getting everything off
her arms.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
Step away, step away, step away.
All right, I'm going to follow
my gut, and we're going to start
with what I think is the most,
see if anybody can beat it.
Ozzy weighs in at 45 pounds of
mud.
Ozzy, come on up.
You're in the number one spot.
So not only are we looking for
the winner of the challenge,
We're looking for the top three.
Let's start with Parvati, see
where you're at.
Parvati weighs in at 24 pounds
of mud.
 Half.
 PROBST: Take a spot next to
Ozzy.
You are currently in second
place.
Adam weighs in.
22 pounds.
Adam currently in third place.
So Adam has the least amount of
weight right now.
Sundra, you need 22 pounds to
crack the top three.
Sundra clocks in at 20 pounds.
Not enough.
Let's see what Becky has.
Becky clocks in at 20 pounds.
Not enough.
Yul, in order to break this top
three, you've got to have to
have 22 pounds.
Otherwise, you three are going
on reward.
By a half a pound, Yul wins.
 Whoa!
 PROBST: As close as it gets.
So Ozzy, Parvati, and Yul, all
enjoying a spa reward.
Ozzy, big decision for you now.
Six days left in this game.
You're sending Becky, Adam, or
Sundra to Exile Island.
 Sorry, bro.
 I know.
 Sorry, man.
 I'm really sorry.
 PROBST: Adam, straight down
to the beach.
 Love you, Adam.
 PROBST: Becky, Sundra,
nothing for you guys.
You're heading back to camp.
Yul, Parvati, Ozzy, have a nice
time at the spa.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: You're going as you
are.
You'll get cleaned up at the
spa.
Head on out.
 Of course it's raining.
 I really wish I was at the
reward.
But I'm not going to cry.
I'm not going to get upset.
I'm happy to be here just with
Becky.
As opposed to anybody else,
yeah, because, you know, we've
been... we've been rolling with
the punches together.
 You know, and today I
seriously saw that.
And I was like... I don't know.
We're being foolish.
I mean, we're fools in the sense
of just saying, "Okay, let's go
on staying strong," because
we're going to have to face them
in the end.
I mean, just, like, today I saw
that.
It was so blatant.
You know, like, his whole bucket
was full, and none of us were
even close.
Like, this is his element.
 Yeah, I know.
 He's like... you can't beat
him.
The challenge today told me a
lot in the sense of Ozzy really
likes to win, and regardless of,
you know, if it's immunity or
reward.
It's not even about that.
It's not even about the prize at
the end.
Ozzy just hates to lose.
 You know what I mean?
 That's what I'm saying.
It wasn't even close for
first place.
You know, I can't risk the sense
of him winning every immunity
challenge and every reward, and
so that's just been lingering in
my head that, you know, he is a
bigger threat than I think
people realize.
 I think at this point in the
game, this is really frustrating
for me, because I'm on the
outside and I don't know what to
do.
I think the only thing that I
can do now is try pulling
someone over to my side and
making them play a strategic
game.
And really, I mean, I think Ozzy
would be my only hope.
 Hi, how are you?
 Good.
 It's beautiful.
 Hi!
Thank you.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 A good shower.
 Oh, wow, beautiful!
 It's nice.
 Oh, my god!
 Oh, god!
I will remember that shower,
that one particular shower, for
the rest of my life.
Because it was hands-down the
best shower I've ever had.
And that was just the beginning.
 Have you had a massage
before?
 I've never had a massage
before.
 You've never had a massage?
 No.
 Oh, you're in for a treat.
We got a massage after that,
which was awesome.
It's a nice reminder of life
outside of this game.
They're giving a hot rock
massage, and they're massaging
my legs right now.
It feels great.
 It smells so good.
What is that smell?
 It's coconut.
 Okay, there's a light at the
end of the tunnel.
All I have left is five days of
dirt, and I can do it.
I've gone 34 days.
I can go five more.
 This is the third time out on
Exile Island.
Third time's a charm.
Except for the charm's not here
anymore-- Yul's got it.
So it hurts to be out here, not
being with Parvati, just to
strategize.
Hopefully, Parvati can find some
way to break up the old Aitutaki
tribe.
Who needs a fire when you can
eat everything raw, right?
I hope I can get some sleep, be
nourished for the challenge that
I've got ahead of me.
It was awful.
It was pouring down rain.
I just laid there, and shivering
and cold.
Not a good thing to go through.
So I've got to keep fighting and
just put up with it for a little
bit longer.
 I feel like its a fairy tale
and I'm going to pinch myself
and wake up in the sandy, gross
tent.
 Well, at least when we go
back, there's only four more
days.
 Kind of a big deal.
 A really big deal.
 I mean, a lot of things can
happen.
You're, like, in the same
position that for a long time I
felt like I was.
You have to win.
Have to win.
 Ozzy's kind of a loner, so
it's hard to get to know him.
But he's opened up to me a
little bit.
Oh, my god!
So many different flavors.
Nothing tastes like coconut.
The more charming I can be, the
more, like, friendly and in I
can get with these people,
especially Ozzy, the longer I'm
going to stick around.
Power outage?
 In the middle of dinner,
raging storm, and then all of a
sudden a blackout.
We lit candles all over the
place, and it turned out to be
very beautiful ambiance.
 All of a sudden, this island
band comes and sets up in the
middle of the living room.
And then these dancers come
running in, and they're all,
like, doing the native dances
and singing, and it was just
this huge island show.
It was, like, way better than
dinner and a movie.
After everything's done, like, I
have a little champagne and some
wine in me, so we just took off
our pajamas and hopped in the
hot tub.
I'm nervous.
I just peed in my pants and I
wasn't even wearing any.
 I don't know if Parvati is
flirting with Ozzy only because
she's hoping there might be some
strategic option there.
Ozzy, to some extent, might be
reciprocating.
I mean, if Ozzy responds in some
way, maybe somewhere down the
line, something might come up.
 I've got two naked guys in
the hot tub.
 Yeah.
 Yee-hah!
 But the numbers are in my
favor at least this once.
 I am looking out for myself.
I mean, I've been playing this
game on an individual level
since I got here, and I'm
playing it now more than ever.
So I might play the game with
Parvati while there's still the
opportunity.
 Camp life the last two days
has been pretty relaxing, just
basically Sundra and me.
If there's one person I think I
miss, probably it would be Yul,
because I've been having some
thought about new strategy.
You know, I would like to get
Ozzy out sooner than later.
 We're back.
 Hi.
 Hi, girls.
 Hey, guys.
 How you doing?
 Good.
 It's okay.
No, don't feel bad.
 I came back to camp, and I
could tell something was a
little bit tense with Becky.
 Some of the stuff that me and
Sundra have been talking about
was that we want to change up
the order.
 Okay.
So Becky took me out to the back
beach and we had a conversation.
 I know that we want the Aitu
four to go forward as much as
possible, and everything.
But just seeing his bucket
full... he didn't win by a
little bit.
He beat us all, like, by a lot.
He's a very strong competitor,
whatever it is-- balance,
endurance-- because he's
playing... he just loves to win.
 I think any of us would have
a hard time against Ozzy.
I would not be happy going to
the final two with Ozzy.
Any one of us going against Ozzy
would be likely to lose on the
jury.
Ozzy has been gaining a lot of
favor with members of the old
Raro tribe, because they
perceive him as being, you know,
kind of a pure player.
He's doing his own thing.
He's not strategizing, he's not
building coalitions.
He's playing a straight-up game
and he's doing a hell of a job
of it.
Either we go to the final four
and take the high road, or we
really play the game to the
final end and we take steps to
ensure that both of us get
there.
 Where's Parvati?
 There was always a concern
that maybe Ozzy would go with
whomever has the best, you know,
sell for him.
So I think definitely Parvati is
a threat.
 Becky said that you think
Parvati is a threat.
I think she's a huge threat.
I've been very surprised at how
strong she's been consistently
in all of these challenges.
At the same time, you know, we
might have to vote off Ozzy.
 You know, at this point, we
know that the other two Raro
members are desperate, so, you
know, it's just one more thing
of "Let's cover our bases, let's
cover our bases, let's cover our
bases."
We don't want any more
surprises, because it's getting
to that point.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
We'll now bring in Adam,
returning from Exile Island.
 How you doing?
Ah, you know.
 How was last night?
 It was a little rough, a
little rough.
 Welcome back, welcome back.
 But, you know, that's Exile
Island for you.
 PROBST: You guys ready to get
to today's immunity challenge?
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 PROBST: First things first.
Ozzy, take back the necklace.
Once again, immunity is back up
for grabs.
For today's challenge, one at a
time, you will carry four
bundles of puzzle pieces across
the balance beams to your mat.
Once you've collected all four
bundles, you will use those
bundles to create a table maze.
Finally, you will use the maze
to maneuver one cannonball past
decoy holes into each of the two
corner pockets.
First person to complete this
wins immunity, guaranteed a one
in five shot at winning this
game.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.
Here we go, for immunity.
Survivors ready?
Go!
One bundle at a time across the
beams.
Ozzy off to a quick lead.
Ozzy across with his first
bundle.
Adam, got to go back, landed
behind the line.
Becky takes a huge leap, barely
makes it over the line.

Bundle.
Yul makes it across with his
first bundle.
Sundra still working with her
first bundle.
Ozzy across easily with his
third bundle.
Yul using his head for balance.
Parvati's across with her first
bundle.
Yul's across with his second
bundle.
Becky takes a bad fall.
Keeps going.
Ozzy trying to hang on with his
fourth and final bundle.
Ozzy's across.
He can start working on the
maze.
Parvati's across, Yul's across.
Yul now with his third bundle.
Parvati with her second.
Ozzy untying his puzzle pieces.
Sundra falls off, has to go
back.
Adam cannot get across.
Yul now catching up on Ozzy with
his fourth bundle.
Can he keep his balance?
Adam falls off again.
Yul clears it with a huge leap.
Yul has his fourth bundle.
It's Yul and Ozzy working on
their table maze.
Parvati across with her third
bundle.
Adam and Sundra yet to get a
bundle across.
Yul making quick work of his
maze.
Adam cannot hang on again.
Parvati across with her fourth
bundle.
She starts to work on the maze.
Becky across with her second
bundle.
 Come on!
 PROBST: Adam struggling to
hang on.
Adam falls off again, getting
frustrated.
Two days on Exile taking their
toll.
Parvati trying to get her pieces
untied to get in this.
Immunity on the line.
Ozzy has his maze together.
Ozzy maneuvering his first
cannonball.
He's got to get one ball in each
of the two corner pockets.
Yul does not have his maze
together correctly.
He's put a roadblock up for
himself.
Ozzy maneuvering it past one of
the decoy holes.
Got to get around it.
And he does.
Now he's got to get it into one
of the two side pockets.
Ozzy has his first cannonball in
one pocket.
Now he's got to get the other
pocket.
Yul desperately trying to get
this maze put together directly
to have a shot.
Parvati still laying hers out on
the ground.
Ozzy working the maze nicely.
Got to get this ball in his
other pocket now.
Ozzy wins immunity!
 Good job, man.
 PROBST: Ozzy, come on over.
Once again, Ozzy is safe from
the vote.
As for the rest you, after 36
long days, this game will come
to an end tonight for one of
you.
Should be a very interesting
afternoon.
See you at tribal.
 Today Ozzy won immunity, as
usual.
I mean, he's just becoming a
bigger and bigger threat, so
we're all pretty aligned on
voting out one of the Raro
folks, either Adam or Parvati.
It's just a question of who to
vote out first.
 Yeah.
 I'm not positive, but I don't
think so.
 Is it Parvati?
 I think it might be Parvati.
 Obviously, I want her to stay
around but I know it's one of us
two.
 It's really a toss-up, but, I
mean, if you want to stay...
 I want to stay.
If you could make that work,
that would be awesome.
 I like you a lot, and, like,
I don't feel you deserved to go
to Exile Island.
It was real close.
If you want to stay, you'll
stay.
 Yul is definitely the puppet
master here, and he acts like
it, too.
He told me, "If you want to stay
I'll take care of it.
It's a done deal."
 I'm pretty sure I can make it
happen.
 Dude, that would be awesome.
 All right.
 You're the man.
My thinking is, as long as it's
benefiting me, I'm fine with it.
You know, Parvati and I have
been together since the
beginning, and I want us both to
continue to be in this game.
But if one of us has to go, you
know, I'd rather her than me.
And then, when it's down to
five, I think my best shot is to
win challenges.
 I don't want to, like, pit
myself against Adam because, you
know, I care about him, and...
but I know that it's one of us
tonight, you know?
 I think objectively you're
probably the bigger threat
between and you Adam, mainly
because you're very coordinated.
So anything kind of requiring
that...
 Balance and agility?
 Yeah, balance, agility.
Like, I think... I mean, you're
far more of a threat than Adam
is.
But because we have Ozzy, and to
some extent me, I'm less worried
about you as a threat.
So for me, I actually see Adam
as being the bigger threat.
Anyway, so that's what I'm
thinking so you know where I
kind of stand.
 I am hopeful, because Yul
says that he sees Adam as being
the bigger threat right now.
But I don't know how... I'm not
going to bank on it at all.
So, basically, I'm going to have
to scramble something together
and try to stay in this game
tonight.
Who are you voting tonight,
Adam?
 I don't know who I'm going to
vote for, but I'm not going to
vote for you or Ozzy.
Either Becky, Sundra, or Yul.
 I just feel already my
position is so precarious, that
if I do something like that, and
then I lost, then I'd definitely
be gone.
 Yeah, but you'd be gone
anyway when you lose, because
you're such a threat.
 Yeah.
I feel like I do dominate at
this point in the challenges,
but I am worried that Yul,
Sundra, and Becky might kick me
out in the future.
So I'm just trying to cover all
the bases at this point and make
sure that I've got more of an
edge later on in the game.
So maybe Sundra might be the one
who's going tonight.
 He's in the shelter now.
 All three?
 Yeah.
 You think they're going to
try to work over Ozzy?
And is there any chance they
would convince him to do
anything?
 Those three versus us three.
 Oh!
 Are you worried, like...
 That Ozzy might be flipping?
 Right now, we noticed that
Parvati and Adam were talking to
Ozzy inside the shelter by
themselves, so just to kind of
mitigate any possibility they
might be trying to work Ozzy
over and get an alliance going
with them, I suggested that I or
someone else go over and just
sit in.
Can I get in the shelter real
quick?
You know, I know you guys are
playing the game, but don't try
to get Ozzy against us.
 I'm not trying to get him.
He was sitting here with
Parvati, and I've got to say
something.
 I know.
Okay, okay.
Do you understand?
I can't sit here and just not
say anything.
 Yeah, okay.
It makes me uneasy the way Yul
reacted.
So maybe I was talking more than
I should have.
I... tonight I have the most
uneasy feeling.
And, you know, I just think that
the chances are greater that
I'll be voted off.
 Do you think Jonathan would
get mad if I showed up wearing
the hat?
Do you think that he would get
mad at that?
 I don't know.
You could try.
 Do you think Jeff is going to
yell at me?
Jonathan, you know, he wanted
his hat, and I thought I would
give it to him.
You know, if I got voted out and
it and I left something that
meant a lot to me here and I
just asked someone to give it to
me, I'd expect them to do it.
I just feel like it's, like, a
nice thing to do.
 Let's call you "Yonathan."
 Yulathan.
 Yulathan.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury.
Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,
Candice, and Jonathan, voted out
at the last tribal council.
Well, normally, the jury doesn't
have any involvement other than
listening, but Yul brought your
hat, Jonathan.
 I see.
Thank you very much.
 PROBST: Quite possibly the
boldest move I've seen yet from
someone trying to win a vote
should they make it to the final
tribal council.
How'd this come into play?
 On the night he was voted
out, he asked, "Can you give me
my hat?"
So I brought his hat.
It has sentimental value for
him.
 PROBST: I just want to make
sure I have the facts right.
This is the same guy who was
part of your little coalition
that you blindsided, and now
you're bringing the hat back
just because it's got
sentimental value.
Becky, did you know Yul was
going to bring the hat?
 Yul had announced he was
going to bring the hat back to
Jonathan.
Even if he doesn't admit to it,
I'm sure he was thinking in the
back of his head he might want
to win some favor back from
Jonathan.
 PROBST: Parvati, these votes
over here are going to be worth
a million dollars to somebody.
Bringing back somebody's
favorite hat could easily turn
somebody into, "You know what?
At least he brought me my hat.
Becky sure didn't, Sundra sure
didn't.
Ozzy didn't."
 Absolutely.
And Yul has been playing this
game to win votes, I think, from
the beginning.
Yul has been playing this game
seamlessly from the start.
 PROBST: Adam, are you
starting to see people play for
the jury a bit?
Because they don't know what's
happening back at camp.
 I don't think Sundra and
Becky or Ozzy are playing for
the jury.
Yul might be a little bit.
I mean, the hat... I don't know
what his intentions were.
 PROBST: Yes, Yul, please?
 All right, well, I'll just
give you the honest truth.
I wanted him to get his hat
back.
He made a request to me, and,
you know, if I voted him out, I
would want to appease any kind
of resentment he might have
towards me.
So, you know, it serves both
purposes.
 PROBST: So Parvati, you, due
to your performance at the
reward challenge, got to partake
in a big spa with Yul and Ozzy.
Did that give you some time to
try and bond with these guys?
 Oh, I would say I bonded with
the fellas.
We had a really good time.
And it, like, made everyone calm
down and, like, regain a little
bit of sanity.
So, I don't know, me and two
guys in a hot tub, odds were in
my favor, I guess.
 PROBST: Adam, a little
concern that even though you and
Parvati are sort of mates in
this, she got some time to bond
with Yul and Ozzy.
Maybe she goes up one notch and
you drop a notch.
 You know, I think I'm at the
bottom of the totem pole, so I
don't think I can drop any more.
So if she goes up, it's not over
me.
 PROBST: Why do you think you
are still in this game?
You seem to be the biggest
physical threat on paper.
 I haven't produced very well,
though, Jeff.
I think my heart's in it, but
I'm not quite all there
physically and mentally anymore.
 PROBST: Yul, on the flip
side, does it concern you that
Ozzy, who is certainly
dominating in challenges, is
actually helping the Aitu four
as much as he's helping himself?
 Absolutely.
We all recognize that that's the
reason why we've been
successful so far.
But internally, we're very
tight, and we get farther
working together than we would
individually.
So yeah, absolutely.
 PROBST: Okay, let's get to
the vote.
Ozzy, you have the immunity
necklace.
Keeping it?
 Oh, hell yeah.
 PROBST: And if the person who
has the hidden immunity idol
needs to play it, you would
present it to me after the vote.
Let's find out who's going home.
It is time to vote.
Ozzy, you're up.
 Love you.
Best of luck.
Enjoy.
 You're a strong competitor.
I definitely underestimated you.
But sorry, I have to vote you
out.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Sundra.
Parvati.
Parvati.
One vote Sundra, two votes
Parvati.
We're tied-- two votes Sundra,
two votes Parvati.
Parvati.
That's three votes Parvati.
15th person voted out, and the
seventh member of our jury,
Parvati.
That's four, that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Parvati, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Well, the five of you have
lasted a long 36 days out here.
And in just three more days, one
of you will win this game and
the million dollars that goes
along with it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.

 PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
 PROBST: next time
on Survivor:
Adam tries to hang on as the
Aitu four turn on each other.
 My biggest fear right now is
it might come down to a
cutthroat game.
 PROBST: And a final twist
will change the game.
Join us for the two hour season
finale and find out who will be
the sole survivor.
 I know that I could have
worked it more in the hot tub if
I'd wanted to, but I don't think
it would have helped my place in
this game.
I've learned so much about
myself.
I really thought I would crack,
and I just realized how strong I
am and just what I'm capable of.
When it comes down to it, if I'm
just thrown into the wilderness
again, I know I can survive.
