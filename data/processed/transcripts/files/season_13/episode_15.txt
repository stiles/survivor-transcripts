         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago on
the stormy waters of the South
Pacific, 20 Americans began the
adventure of a lifetime.
 Get overboard!
 They were divided into four
unique tribes-- African
American, Asian American,
Latino, and Caucasian.
 Different ethnic groups.
I mean, is that kosher?








 Need a break!
 PROBST: The conflict within
the tribes...
 He likes to take long breaks.
And we've got too much to do.
 PROBST: ...quickly became
apparent.
 No!
 I am so sorry.
 I'm not happy with Flicka.
I can forgive her.
But I don't have to forgive her.
 You have a touch of bad wind.
There, you'll feel better now.








 It looks like it's burned.
 I've never been accepted by
the Asian community.
I don't fit the stereotype.
 PROBST: At the first immunity
challenge...
Puka wins the challenge!
...the Hiki tribe placed last,
and was sent to tribal council,
where Sekou was the first person
voted out.
The tribe has spoken.
On day four...
 I trust you.
 PROBST: Yul and Becky made a
pact to the end.
 Sticking together obviously
would help us in the game.
 I want to stay together.
I agree.
In Korean you call an older
brother an opa.
Yul's sort of like an older
brother to me.
 At the next challenge Ozzy of
the Aitu tribe concocted a plan
to throw away immunity to get
rid of Billy.
Aitu is having a holiday.
 Billy dug his own hole by
just not working.
 PROBST: But even in defeat
Billy thought he made a love
connection.
 PROBST: On Exile Island Yul
deciphered the clues...
 Oh, mama.
 PROBST: ...and found the
hidden immunity idol which would
be good through the final four.
 Yes!
 PROBST: At Aitu's tribal
council...
 I'm still talking here.
You'll get your turn.
 PROBST: ...Billy fought
back...
 You're Mr. Cool.
You'll get your turn.
 PROBST: ...and made a
startling confession.
 I fell in love in this game,
love at first sight.
Her name is Candice.
 PROBST: Candice from Raro
tribe?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: It was the nail in
Billy's coffin.
Billy, the tribe has spoken.
On day seven...
Drop your buffs.
...the four tribes merged into
two.
You are the new Aitu tribe.
You are the new Raro tribe.
 Give it all you've got!
Go!
 PROBST: At the challenge...
Yul going to try to fight them
off as long as he can.
...the physically dominant Raro
tribe outmuscled Aitu.
Raro wins immunity.
Before tribal council...
 I need you guys.
 PROBST: ...the new Aitu
ignored old tribal lines...
as Cao Boi targeted Becky.
But Yul revealed his secret to
Becky.
 I found the idol.
 That's so awesome.
 PROBST: And convinced the
tribe to target Cecilia.
The tribe has spoken.
The seemingly weaker Aitu tribe
made strides...
 It's like a fish for each of
us.
 PROBST: ...thanks in part to
Ozzy's unmatched survival
skills.
Go.
And Aitu was able to beat the
physically dominant Raro...
Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.
...in the next immunity
challenge.
Aitu wins the challenge!
At Raro's tribal council...
Fourth person voted out of the
Cook Islands.
...Raro blindsided J.P.
Then they lost Stephannie and
Christina in back to back
defeats.
Yul and Jonathan emerged as
power brokers on Aitu.
And at their next two tribal
councils...
Sixth person voted out
of Survivor: Cook Islands...
...they ousted Cao Boi...
The tribe has spoken.
...and Jessica.
On day 20, the game changed
drastically when both tribes
were given a chance to mutiny.
If you want to move step
off your mat and join the other
tribe.
The clock is ticking.
Four, three, two...
Candice is mutinying.
First Candice then Jonathan
betrayed their Aitu tribe and
reunited with some of their
former tribemates.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Welcome back.
 PROBST: Aitu was left with
only four members and very
little hope.
 Standing there, you're
feeling so small and pitiful,
and you look over to the Raro
side, and they look so big and
triumphant.
 PROBST: Go!
But the unexpected happened when
the underdog Aitus won first the
reward...
Aitu wins reward!
...then the immunity challenge.
Bounty.
Aitu wins immunity!
The eight members of Raro were
sent to tribal council with a
bruised ego, and Brad was voted
out.
The tribe has spoken.
Yul and Sundra found their first
chest.
The Aitu four kept up the
winning streak.
The new Aitu tribe wins their
third challenge in a row!
Tenth person voted out and the
second member of our jury...
And Raro lost Rebecca and then
Jenny.
The tribe has spoken.
Drop your buffs.
You are merging into one tribe.
On day 25 the tribes merged, and
the Aitu four, who were
outnumbered by the Raro five,
were in trouble again.
 The fact of the matter
remains that we're still divided
into two tribes, and we
desperately need to convince
someone to come over to our
side.
 PROBST: In a risky attempt to
lure Jonathan back to their
side, Yul showed him the hidden
immunity idol.
 I'm asking you for both of
our sakes to become my ally
again.
 PROBST: Jonathan was
conflicted.
 I have a lot to think about
and a huge decision to make--
either I'll have betrayed the
Raro people and I'm a complete
bastard, or I didn't jump over
to the Aitu people, and I'm a
complete bastard.
 PROBST: But Yul's gamble paid
off.
12th person voted out, and the
fourth member of our jury...
Jonathan betrayed his alliance
for the second time, and Nate
was voted out.
The tribe has spoken.
Back at camp tempers flared.
 Didn't you call me a
disgusting rat?
 Well, Jonathan, you're a rat
because you've betrayed
everybody in this game.
And all these people have said
that they don't like you.
 You know what?
That's bollocks, and you know
it.
 PROBST: At tribal council,
Adam and Candice turned up the
heat.
 You're a rat.
 That's a fact, that I'm a
rat?
I know.
That's enough out of you.
 There's absolutely no reason
for you to be around now,
though.
 Says you, Jack, says you.
 PROBST: 13th person voted
out, and the fifth member of our
jury...
Candice was voted out.
But before leaving she received
a parting gift from Adam.
Candice, the tribe has spoken.
Pavarti and Adam stepped up
their game and threatened Yul.
 Why not have me or Pavarti in
the fifth spot instead of
Jonathan?
 Parvati and Adam threatened
me, pointing out the fact that
they would be on the jury, and
if I didn't vote off Jonathan
they would hold me responsible.
 PROBST: Yul and the Aitu four
buckled.
14th person voted out, and the
sixth member of our jury...
Jonathan was voted out.
Jonathan, the tribe has spoken.
 Well, it's you or me, kid.
 PROBST: Knowing they were
next, Parvati and Adam tried to
sway Ozzy.
While Becky and Yul began to
question their chances against
Ozzy.
 I think any of us would have
a hard time against Ozzy.
I would not be happy going to
the final two with Ozzy.
He's playing straight up game
and he's doing a hell of a job
of it.
 PROBST: Ozzy having no
trouble.
Yul was right.
Ozzy proved unstoppable in the
individual challenges.
Ozzy wins immunity!
And kept himself safe with the
immunity necklace.
15th person voted out, and the
seventh member of our jury.
The Aitu four remained solid and
Parvati was the next to go....
Pavarti, the tribe has spoken.
...leaving Adam on his own with
heavy odds to overcome.
Now five remain-- Ozzy, Adam,
Yul, Becky, and Sundra.
Tonight they will compete in
their final immunity challenges.
And in one last twist the final
tribal council will be changed.
Who will outlast all the rest to
become the sole survivor?

 I was by myself last night.
I had no one to sleep with.
It's like I was back on Exile
Island.
 We like how the story has
played so far-- you know, the
underdogs becoming the
champions.
But we never did discuss, once
we get to the final four what
will we do?
 It's about that time where we
have to think individually.
There are probably going to be
hurt feelings.
But that's the game.
 The Aitu four, we've gotten
this far because we stuck
together.
But it's going to come down to a
point when we're going to be
compete can against each other
in our Aitu four.
And Ozzy can be really, really
hard to beat.
So it might be to our advantage
to eliminate him when we get the
chance.
 I think we should just hide
these and take a couple of them.
 Let's just go enjoy the
morning.
 The fact that we overcame so
much together, it just feels
like it's somehow poetic.
But tomorrow things might change
between us.
I know I'm a threat.
I'm a huge threat.
So I'd say winning immunity is
crucial for my survival in the
rest of this game.
♪ Tree mail
tree mail. ♪
Oh, lordy.
 Oh, boy.
What is this?
 A hanging thing.
 "North, south, east, west.
Every direction is a test.
Slither, run, balance, soar.
Guarantee a spot in the final
four.
Obstacle course.
I feel like an obstacle course.
Okay, let's go stretch.
 I'm a little bit nervous
about the immunity challenge
today, because who gets immunity
will sort of decide the final
four.
If Adam wins immunity one of the
Aitu four will be going home
tonight.
So the game will definitely
change.
 We're so close, guys.
The vision that we had is
finally going to come true, and
it's going to be us in the final
four.
Let's do it.
 It's extremely important for
me to win this one.
You know, it's them four against
me.
But it doesn't matter.
I've got to go out there put up
a fight, and try to win and try
to stay in this game.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Hope you're ready for some fun
today.
 Your idea of fun.
 Oh, my, gosh.
Wow.
 PROBST: Let's get to the
challenge.
First things first.
Ozzy, give it back.
 Hope to see it soon.
 PROBST: Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge you will
race around a ropes course to
eight different stations,
collecting a bag of puzzle
pieces at each station.
Each time you get a bag you have
to come back to your table
before you can go back out.
Once you have all eight bags you
will use those puzzle pieces to
construct an eight-point compass
rose puzzle.
Only once your puzzle is
assembled correctly will you be
able to raise your flag.
First person to raise their flag
wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final four.
Losers, tribal council, somebody
going home.
For what it's worth, in 13
seasons of Survivor this is the
most difficult puzzle we've ever
had.
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: Ready to get started?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots
and we'll get going.
Here we go, for immunity and
a spot in the final four.
Survivors ready?
Go!

Ozzy, come on over.
For the fourth time you have
individual immunity, you are
safe from the vote tonight,
guaranteed a spot in the final
four.
Sadly for the rest of you,
tribal council tonight, somebody
will be going home.
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.
I'll see you at tribal.
 I feel really good about
today's immunity win.
I'm just happy that I was able
to pull it out.
Now the competition is
ourselves.
And I'm looking at Yul as my
competition, basically, so
hopefully I'll be able to win
the next two and secure my spot
definitely in the top two.
I can't believe it.
 Wow.
Two more nights, that's it.
The Aitutaki four has made it to
the final four.
Also, I still have the hidden
immunity idol, which I can still
play in the final four.
So I've maneuvered myself into a
very good position.
But now it's a different ball
game.
I'm hoping it will be relatively
clean.
But, you know, if it just gets
ugly then we'll see what
happens.
Right now with Aitu, Yul is in
control of the game.
You know, he's been in control
for a while.
It bothers me.
So I would like to get the idol
out of Yul's hands just to stir
it up right before I go home.
I wanted to see if you and
Sundra and me wanted to vote
just to get it out, and then
they'll vote for me.
 Adam asked me if, you know, I
wanted to vote against Yul and
see if Sundra would vote against
Yul to bring the idol out.
He's trying to place little
seeds of doubt in people's minds
to shake things up.
So it's just weird thoughts and
ideas floating around camp.
And it could go a lot of ways,
really.
 You can only use it from four
to three, and if you don't get
out tonight, then next tribal
council, if he needs it, he'll
use it.
He's guaranteed top three, Yul
is.
 There's this conflicting side
of me where I'm like, "Hey, I
want a shot at that final two,
and Yul's going to make it
really hard."
So of course there's that
conflict, you know?
We're still playing a game, and
we have to make strategic moves.
 It's going to be interesting
from this point on, though.
I want to see if this last-ditch
effort with Ozzy and Sundra will
work.
And hopefully something will
come out of it.
 Right now I'm still here.
And who knows what's in store?
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,
Candice, Jonathan, and Parvati,
voted out at the last tribal
council.
So Ozzy, let's get right to it.
Did anything happen today to
help change Adam's fate?
 No.
No.
I mean, I got the necklace, so
that was the only thing really
that could have changed.
 PROBST: So just so I'm clear,
Adam's done.
 Yes, Jeff, I think I'm done.
You know, I had my opportunity,
and I came up short.
And these four aren't budging.
They've got blinders on, and
they're set on them four in the
final four.
 PROBST: Becky, how will the
game change after tonight's
vote?
There will be nowhere left to
hide, nobody else to vote out
except your own tribe.
 I think that you'll see, in
the challenges coming up, Yul,
Sundra, and myself fighting much
harder.
Before there was a lot of that
letting Ozzy sort of win for us
as a four and taking out the
competition.
But I think that definitely
we're going to have a little bit
of a stronger fight.
 PROBST: That's an interesting
comment, Becky, because you've
talked about ethics and how you
play this game, and you just
said, "We've been riding Ozzy's
coattails, letting him win all
the challenges for us."
 He's helped us.
But I wouldn't say riding on
him.
I don't think that... I don't
look at it that way, I guess.
 PROBST: Ozzy?
 For me, I don't care.
I just want to win.
And I want to win tomorrow, and
I want to win the next day.
And that's the way that I've
been playing the game, to make
it as far as I could on my own,
and that's the way that I'm
going to keep playing the game.
I'm still going to go out there
and try and win, you know?
 But it is true.
Ozzy's job is to win the
challenges.
Yul is more of the guy behind
everything.
And I'm not sure what these two
do.
They're boring people, that's
for sure, and they don't like to
take risks at all.
But it's worked out for them.
 PROBST: Did you try to work
any magic today?
 I tried to see if they wanted
to at least get the idol out,
because that would give them
each an even shot instead of Yul
having the advantage.
 PROBST: So Becky, tell me why
it doesn't hurt to you leave it
in the game.
If Yul leaves here tonight with
it, he's fine at the next vote.
Ozzy hasn't lost a challenge in
I don't know how long.
So if the results are the same
you, Becky, or you, Sundra going
home.
 Personally, for myself, it's
not the right time for it to
come out.
There is opportunity for it to
come out at the next tribal
council, and right now it's not
the time.
 If Yul wins immunity, he can
protect somebody else like
Becky.
So why would Becky want that
idol gone?
Think about that.
 PROBST: You're right.
That's another good scenario.
But one of these two is
vulnerable.
 They've been riding him the
entire way here.
So I think they don't want to
mess that up.
And they think that if he wins
immunity he'll give it to one of
them, each of them.
Maybe they both think that.
 I'd just like to bring up one
other possibility that might
explain why people haven't been
challenging for the idol.
The reason we got here because
we've all been really tight.
There haven't been any cracks in
our alliance.
And the four of us have an
extremely loyal to the concept
of moving forward together as a
tribe.
So I think that might also
explain why people haven't been
angling for it.
 PROBST: With all due respect,
it's easy to say when you're the
one with the idol in your back
pocket.
You can say, "Let's stay
together, guys."
Right?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Well, Adam, it does
seem like your time has come.
We'll find out.
It is time to get to the vote.
Ozzy, you have the individual
immunity necklace.
You want to do something crazy
with it?
 No, no.
No, no.
 PROBST: You cannot vote for
Ozzy.
Doesn't found like the hidden
immunity idol is coming into
play.
If it does, you'll let me know.
It is time to vote.
Ozzy, you're up.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Adam.
Yul.
One vote Adam, one vote Yul.
Adam.
Two votes Adam.
One vote Yul.
16th person voted out, and the
eighth member of our jury, Adam.
That's three.
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Adam, the tribe has spoken.
Well, the four of you did what
seemed impossible to make it to
this point.
And now the game does change.
Like it or not, you're going to
have to turn on each other.
It's going to be fun to watch it
play out.
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.
Good night.
 Ozzy, Yul, Becky, and Sundra,
you guys got us good.
You knocked us all out.
You know, you beat us fair and
square.
I played the game the best I
could.
Just came up a little short.
All I can say is congratulations
and good luck to all of you.
 Oh, guys, it happened.
 We did it.
 We did it!
 We did it!
 I can't believe we made it,
guys.
I hope we have some time to
enjoy this.
 Guys, I love what we've done
together.
 The fact that we as the Aitu
four have made it this far, it's
an amazing accomplishment.
It's amazing.
We managed to eliminate eight
Raro members, and we're here,
and it's really fulfilling.
 I am so glad that the winner
of Survivor is going to be from
a minority community.
I think it speaks volumes, that
oftentimes the strongest teams
are the ones that have a
diversity of perspective and
backgrounds.
And the fact that we were able
to bond so tightly together and
really kind of succeed under
very long odds I think is a
great morality tale.
 I woke up before dawn,
realizing that this is the
second to last morning.
This could be my last morning,
you know, if things don't go
well.
I just wanted to enjoy this
moment and kind of relish the
experience, because to make it
this far is... it's a feat.
I just wanted to get out here
and enjoy this beautiful
sunrise.
I'm just focusing my energy and
getting ready for the day.
Getting ready to go out and
hopefully win.
Because that's what I got to do
at this point.
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Tree mail!
 We got two things.
 Are you guys ready?
"Congratulations, final four.
The morning of day 38 is a very
special time.
Get into your canoe and paddle
to the biggest island and hike
to the top of the highest point.
You'll find the torches at
the...
...who have been voted out of
the game.
As you pass by each take a
moment to reflect upon your
fallen comrades as well as their
time here in the Cook Islands."
 You guys, look.
Rites of passage.
 "You will collect the torches
as you go, lay them to rest in
the fire.
You must then follow the map to
your final immunity challenge."
 Whoa, guys!
 Final immunity challenge?
We got tree mail, and we were
told that we're going to our
final immunity challenge, which
kind of blew our minds, because
we have one challenge left, and
we have four people.
So we don't know what exactly
that means.
But I'm sure it's going to be a
doozy.
 I'm so happy to be sharing
this with you.
 Today's tree mail indicated
that the Aitu four are going to
be able to actually go through
the rites of passage together.
It was pretty exciting, because
I think typically three people
go through that by themselves.
And for the Aitu four to be able
to remember everyone in this
game, I think that's going to be
really special for us today.
 Sekou.
He had a lot of energy.
 I didn't come in to the tribe
with the idea that I was going
to be the leader.
But in situations like these you
have to just step up to the
plate and do what you need to
do.
 All right, Billy.
 I rediscovered that I'm a
dream chaser and not some
player.
That's what I'll take away from
this-- the new discovered
fondness for being what I am--
that heavy metal, head banging,
rock and roll rebel.
 Cecelia.
 Cecilia.
The Peruvian princess.
 I've always considered myself
a person that plays on the safer
side.
I don't like putting myself out
there where I'm going to get
hurt or injured.
But I definitely discovered that
I'm not as scared as I thought I
was.
 J.P.
You big stud.
 Man, this game's brutal.
It takes more than just being
strong and big and physical.
And you've got to really
understand your surroundings.
And you cannot rest at any time,
because something might be going
on behind your back.
 Stephannie.
 I would love to have stayed
in the game a little while
longer.
But if your mind's not
completely there 100%, you're
not at your best.
And this was my case.
 Yeah, you're missed.
 All right, Cao Boi.
I am most vulnerable among the
Asian community, my own
community-- people are like me
but not like me.
And I've actually changed my
opinion of them.
Eventually I learned to trust
them.
And I trust them explicitly.
I trust them that they are not
so typical.
 Cristina.
 A tough cookie.
 Being a police officer does
make it harder to play a game
like this.
You know, you want to be a role
model.
Yeah, it would be great to win a
million dollars, but I don't
want to step over someone to get
it.
 Sweet old Jessica.
Flicka, Flicka.
 Flicka flame.
 I knew I was strong.
But I'm stronger than I
realized, and I'm more
comfortable with myself than I
anticipated, you know?
I really hope that I left some
of my spirit behind with the
tribe, because I have the right
attitude.
 The best part of the game for
me was stepping outside of my
comfort zone.
It was the best and worst
experience of my life.
 My Survivor experience showed
me how strong I am and how weak
I can be.
And I learned that you don't
always have to be the toughest
person.
It's okay.
 I doubted myself and didn't
think I could do Survivor, but I
did it.
I lasted longer than I thought I
would.
So I do have a lot of strength
that I never thought I could
ever have.
 Nate dog.
 Another original Hiki member.
 I had a lot of fun, just
because it was so new to me.
Not really my cup of tea, you
know?
I'm more of, like, a city cat.
This game definitely taught me
that in life I'm going with what
I feel inside.
 I am a very competitive
person.
I want to win.
I want to be in there.
I want to be in the middle of
it.
And that's just my personality.
With Adam and I, I could feel
that he was a genuine person and
what you see is what you get
with him.
I knew I could trust him.
I didn't win, but played the
game the only way that I could--
all out.
 Jonathan.
 Jonathan.
 Thank you, Jonathan.
Thank you, thank you.
 I had so much fun out here, I
can't begin to tell you.
44-year-old Jew in Survivor.
I lasted day 33.
That's okay.
I lost 30 pounds in 33 days, and
I feel fantastic.
I feel like the guy my wife
married.
 I thought that I was running
the show for a little while,
because I'm a flirty girl, and
guys respond to that.
But I feel like, you know, they
all thought that I was, like,
this wimpy little, like, ditzy
sorority girl, and you know,
couldn't really hold my own.
And I think I shocked a few
people by staying in as long as
I did.
And I kind of shocked myself.
 I'm a little bit frustrated
that I did get so close and
didn't win it all.
But you can't let that haunt
you, you know?
You can't change the past.
You know, I learned a tremendous
amount about myself.
I'm not afraid to say anything
to anybody.
And that's the type of person I
am.
So if you really want it, I'm
going to tell it like it is.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Day 38, and we are down to four.
You guys ready to get to your
final immunity challenge?
 Yes.
 PROBST: First things first.
Ozzy, I'll take it back again.
 There you go.
 PROBST: Thanks.
Immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge you will
be standing on a small steel
perch situated in the water.
Each perch has been individually
proportioned to your foot size
so everything is equal.
Every 15 minutes you'll remove a
section of the perch, making it
smaller and more difficult.
When you get down to the last
piece of the perch, you will be
standing on a section that is
less than half the size of a
postcard.
Last person left standing on
their perch wins immunity,
guaranteed a spot in the final
three.
And the reason that is so
important is that for the first
time ever final tribal council
will include not two people but
three.
Three people will take part in
that final vote.
Three people will be eligible
for the million dollars.
This is it.
Ready to get started?
 Yeah!
 PROBST: Let's head out.
This challenge is on.
This first stage will be 15
minutes long.
Calm day, sun is out.
Perfect day for a long
challenge.
Okay, it's time to release the
first section of perch.
Everybody grab the rope.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, release.
Nicely done.
It's now time to release the
second section.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, release.
 Oh, cool water.
 PROBST: Okay.
At this time you will remove the
other side.
It's going to get a little more
difficult now.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, release.
 Oh, my, gosh.
 PROBST: And with that, Becky
is the first one out of the
challenge.
We are now down to three.
Ozzy, Sundra, Yul.
Becky's fate is now out of her
hands.
She cannot control her destiny
in this game.
As it stands now, Yul is the
only person that can guarantee
himself a spot in the final
three, because he has the hidden
immunity idol.
If Yul wins immunity that would
allow him to keep immunity for
himself and give immunity to
someone else.
When you remove this last piece
of the perch, you will be left
with a section to stand on that
is less than half the size of a
postcard.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, release.
Ozzy recovers from a near fall.
Sundra balancing on one foot
using just the ball of her other
foot.
Yul doing very well in his
squat.
Three very different strategies.
Ozzy with a nice recovery.
Sundra seems to have found a
really good spot.
Ozzy, how are your toes doing?
 Toes are okay.
The sweat's the biggest factor
for me.
It's making my nether regions
itchy.
Sorry to get gross.
 PROBST: Sundra loses her
balance.
 I didn't mean to mess you up,
Sundra.
 PROBST: Sundra, how are your
feet?
 They're okay.
 PROBST: Yul, where are you
feeling it?
 My toes and my ankles.
 PROBST: Yul tries to step up,
loses his balance.
Yul is the second person out of
this challenge.
Last person left standing
guarantees themselves a spot in
that final three with a shot at
a million dollars.
You guys have been up there now
a total now of two hours.
 Good lord.
 PROBST: One hour since you
went to the final piece of the
perch.
Sundra has a momentary bit of
imbalance.
Catches herself.
Been up there now for two and a
half hours.
 Damn.
 PROBST: Sundra losing her
balance.
Sundra is in the water.
Ozzy wins the final immunity.
 Oh, my god!
 That was a great job.
That was amazing.
 PROBST: Once again, you have
immunity.
This time it guarantees you a
spot at the final tribal
council.
Becky, Yul, Sundra, two of you
will join Ozzy at the final
tribal.
One of you will become our ninth
and final member of the jury.
See you there.
Swim on in.
 Ozzy, give a girl a chance to
wear the necklace.
 Oh, man, I'm so pumped about
winning the challenge today.
It was down to the wire.
Sundra completely stunned me.
I thought she would have been
off a lot faster than she was.
There was few times I almost
fell off, but I stayed up.
And it's crazy to think that I'm
finally here, that this is it.
You did an amazing job.
You should be proud.
 I'm just picturing myself
with the immunity necklace
walking in and jury going,
"Whoa, Sundra got it," you know?
So I'm disappointed.
I really thought I had it.
I really did.
It all comes to a head in couple
of hours.
 We're going to tribal council
tonight.
Ozzy has immunity.
I have the hidden immunity idol.
So either Sundra or Becky will
go home tonight.
The question is who to vote off.
 I mean, what do you think?
 I don't know.
 Of course.
It's definitely different for
you than it is for me, because I
don't have that tie.
I don't have anything against
Becky.
I don't want to vote her out.
But I couldn't say that there is
any huge difference between them
in who is more deserving or not.
Unless something gets figured
out, I think it's going to come
down to a tiebreaker.
The Aitu four, from the moment
of the mutiny we've tried to be
as fair and equal as possible
and do things the right way.
So I think the fairest thing
that we can come up with is a
tiebreaker.
You know, two of us vote for
Becky, two of us vote for
Sundra, and we let them decide,
however that is.
I mean, who knows what it's
going to be?
But I don't feel like I should
be in the position to make that
decision.
I mean, the way that we've done
it the whole time is trying to
be as fair as possible.
So not to do that now I think
would be a mistake.
 But just because of today...
 I was trying to convince him,
you know, but...
 Yul has offered me the
immunity idol.
And the idol guarantees my spot
in the final three.
To the jury it would probably
look really bad with the sneak
attack coming in and, you know,
presenting me with the idol.
But it's me or her going home
tonight.
So it's a really hard choice.
Oh, yeah.
Let's do this.
 I'm not deciding between the
two of you.
Fairest thing to do would be a
tiebreaker.
 I could save Becky
tonight by giving her the idol.
The downside to that for me is
I'd be at risk.
There's no guarantee that I
won't get voted out tonight.
So I'm personally facing a major
dilemma.
 Did she ask you?
Did she ask you to give her the
idol?
No?
No.
 I've had to make so many
compromises, and broken so many
promises, but the one thing I've
always kind of stayed true to is
my friendship with Becky.
So to continue honoring that I
feel like I might have to give
her the idol.
 One, two, three.
It's a tough, tough decision.
And I hope to God just things
work out.
 PROBST: We'll now bring the
members of our jury.
Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate,
Candice, Jonathan, Parvati, and
Adam, voted out at the last
tribal council.
So here's the situation.
After tonight's vote, three of
you will move on to the final
tribal council and have a shot
at the million dollars.
The person voted out will become
the ninth and final member of
our jury.
So let's review where we are.
Yul and Ozzy appear to be safe.
Yul because as far as I know
still has the hidden immunity
idol.
Ozzy is wearing immunity.
That leaves us with Becky and
Sundra.
Last tribal council you had a
plan.
You weren't worried.
So Sundra, do you feel
differently tonight than you did
last tribal council?
 My decision to not actively
go to out the idol was a risk,
and you have to be ready for the
good and the bad.
I was never worry free.
I knew that there was a risk I'd
have to take.
And I'm willing to live with how
things are.
 PROBST: So, with Becky and
Sundra sitting on the hot seat,
Ozzy, you go back to camp.
Was there any discussion about
who deserves it?
 We got back and right away I
said, "You know, I think that it
should be a tie."
And the girls agree that that
was probably the best thing to
do.
So instead of going behind each
others' back, none of that
happened at all.
So I'm voting for Becky out.
Yul is voting for Sundra out.
They're obviously voting for
each other.
And we're going to let the cards
fall where they may.
 PROBST: Yul, you're in an
interesting position.
Because if you still have the
hidden immunity idol you could
give it to somebody, and nobody
would necessarily know, which
gives you power.
 I knew that the idol could
potentially be played tonight.
But I came up with a solution
that everyone seemed happy with.
So...
 PROBST: Sundra, if Yul wanted
to play the idol he certainly
wouldn't say he was going to,
and he would say exactly what he
just did, which is, "Never
really came up."
 Of course.
That thought came into my head
several times.
And if I get played then I'm the
big sucker, you know?
And if he does that, that's on
him.
 PROBST: Becky, it go through
your head that, "Maybe Yul will
give me the idol-- I don't want
to bug him, but I'd like to have
it"?
 Of course it went through my
head.
I mean, you know, you think that
you maintain a relationship with
somebody, and you get pretty
close.
I mean, I've known Yul since the
very first tribe.
But at the same time, if I were
to accept the idol, how would
that be presented to the jury?
 PROBST: So Yul, again, what
goes through the head of the
person who has that power and
all these choices?
 I came into this game maybe
with sort of a naive expectation
that maybe I can play a
completely clean game.
And I realized quickly that's
not possible.
So, you know, the idol could be
played tonight.
But I still try to stay true to
certain things, which is loyalty
to the people I came here with.
But you make a lot of
compromises in this game.
 PROBST: So Ozzy, you are
safe.
You have the immunity necklace.
You're not giving it up.
 Hell, no.
 PROBST: From what we know Yul
still has the hidden immunity
idol.
It doesn't sound like he's given
it to anybody.
We're going to find out.
It is time to vote.
Ozzy, you're up.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Becky.
Sundra.
Becky.
Two votes Becky, one vote
Sundra.
One vote left.
We are in fact tied, two votes
each.
The big question-- do either of
you have the hidden immunity
idol?
We'll move to a tiebreaker.
Okay.
It is a fire-making challenge.
Becky, Sundra, take a spot
behind either of the fire-making
stations, whichever one you
want.
You each have the same
materials.
You each have flint and steel in
the form of a knife.
Same amount of coconut husk and
wooden kindling.
You must build a fire with a
flame high enough to burn
through the rope.
When you burn through the rope,
you'll ring a bell.
One of you going be in the final
three, one of you going to the
jury.
Survivors ready?
Begin.
Neither person trying to make
fire.
First trying to build the
structure.
Sundra now pulling out the
coconut husk.
Becky now working with the
coconut husk.
Sundra the first to try and get
a spark.
Trying to light it.
Becky now following suit.
Who will get the first flame?
All right, stop right where
you're at.
We're going to go to matches.
 All right.
 PROBST: Three, two, one, go.
Becky and Sundra both ready to
start making fire, both going
for their matches.
Sundra has a flame.
Becky having trouble lighting
her match.
Sundra has a flame going, trying
to keep it alive.
Becky now has flame.
Going to have to build a flame
that will last long enough and
burn high enough to burn through
that rope.
Both fires out.
Sundra nurturing a little
fire.
Becky has a little fire going.
And once again both fires out.
After 38 days out here, you
should both know how to make
fire.
Sundra lights a match.
Both women have dismantled their
teepees.
They're going to try something
different.
Becky lights a match.
Sundra's flame goes out.
Can she get it back?
 I'm out.
 PROBST: And Sundra is out of
matches.
Becky seems to have a fire that
might have some legs.
Sundra can only watch.
She has no way to start a fire.
Becky has a good fire going.
She just has to get the flame
high enough to reach the rope.
That's going to do it.
With that, Becky joins Ozzy and
Yul as the third member of the
final three.
Sundra, you become the 17th
person out of this game, and the
ninth and final member of our
jury.
You need to bring me your torch.
Sundra, the tribe has spoken.
You have now gone as far as you
can go in this game.
The power now shifts to the
jury.
Nine people that you had a hand
in voting out of this game now
hold your fate in their hands.
You have one more night here in
the Cook Islands.
I hope you enjoy it.
I'll see you tomorrow for your
final tribal council.
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.
Good night.
 The fact that I even made it
this far, it's just ignited so
many things in me.
And I'm so proud.
And I gave it my all, like I did
everything else.
And Becky, Yul, and Ozzy, one of
you is going to win a million,
and you're taking me out to
dinner.
 Cheers!
 Yeah!
 Yes.
 Day 39.
Whoo!
( speaking spanish )
It's amazing.
( speaking spanish )
 At the end of today we'll be
human again.
 ( with Spanish accent ) Human
again.
I cannot wait.
Every ten minutes or so I've
got to, like, pinch myself just
to make sure this I'm not in
some kind of incredibly lucid
dream.
 Oh, how I've been looking
forward to this day.
Beautiful morning.
 Last sunrise.
Last sunrise.
I'm in a state of lots of mixed
feelings, including shock that I
was able to survive the fire
challenge last night.
And also I am very proud of
myself for not giving in to
temptation of taking the easy
route and just accepting the
offer from Yul to take the idol.
Because tonight for sure I think
that the jury members will be
coming at me with questions
about riding the backs of Ozzy
and Yul.
But I think that I have played a
very social game.
I'm proud of it.
 What the hell?
Yul, get out here!
Oh, my god.
Whoa!
 Yeah!
Yeah!
Becky!
 Becky!
 Thank you.
Thank you very much.
 First things first.
 Got to wait for Becky.
Oh, my god.
 What the hell?
Becky!
Where is she?
 You know, I do believe it was
a little symbolic that it was
Yul and I that happened to be
there when the feast arrived.
I think that that was symbolic
of how the jury vote will play
out.
I think Yul and I will get the
majority of the votes, and
really doubting that Becky's
going to get any votes,
especially because last night
was such an incredibly
embarrassing display of
fire-making skills.
 Becky!
Come on!
 Come on!
Where have you been?
 You missed it.
It's like a Cook feast!
The fact that I was able to
start this whole adventure with
Becky on day one, the fact that
I'm able to finish with it her,
you know, has got to be a dream,
right?
 Congratulations, guys.
 Woo-hoo!
 Finding a really good friend
is worth more than a million
dollars.
I mean, friendships like the one
I have with Becky I think are
that rare.
I tried to play the game with as
much integrity as I could.
I know that I failed in a lot of
respects.
But, you know, hopefully people
won't hold it against me that I
beat them.
 I'm just hoping final tribal
goes really well.
I hope I can get my point
across.
I've got a lot of pride, and I
feel like I'm representing
Mexico, and I have broken a lot
of stereotypes.
I'm a surfer up against two
lawyers.
Hopefully my actions, my
intentions, and everything that
I've done in this game speak for
themselves.
All I've got to do is hold it
together one more night,
and finally this dream may take
a step into reality.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
your final jury.
Brad.
Rebecca.
Jenny.
Nate.
Candice.
Jonathan.
Parvati.
Adam.
And Sundra, voted out at the
last tribal council.
Welcome to your final tribal
council.
Ozzy, immunity doesn't come into
play anymore.
You can take that off and set it
down.
 Cool.
 PROBST: After 39 days the
power in this game shifts from
the three of you-- Ozzy, Becky
and Yul-- to the jury.
Nine people that you had a hand
either directly or indirectly in
voting out tonight, they will
decide who they think is most
deserving of the title of sole
survivor and the million dollars
that goes along with it.
Here is how it's going to work.
You will each get a chance to
make an opening statement to
convince this jury of why you
are the most deserving person to
win this game.
The jury will then get their
opportunity to address you.
Jury, you can direct your
questions and comments to any or
all of the final three.
It's up to you.
Then we will vote.
Shall we get started?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Yul, opening
statement.
 When I came here I wanted to
play a certain way.
I didn't want to just play an
individual game where I just got
myself to the final.
I honestly feel that I've
probably done more than anyone
else to really affect and
influence the overall course of
this game.
I was able to bring everyone in
my tribe and everyone in my
alliance to the final four, and
ultimately to the final three.
I don't think it's just
coincidence that I've been on
the teams and alliances that
ultimately became dominant.
I think I played a pretty key
role in leading these teams.
I won't lie about the fact that
I have had to manipulate and
deceive people.
But I stayed loyal to people who
are loyal to me.
So I would love to get your vote
tonight.
And I feel like I've earned my
way here.
I have played ever facet of the
game, and in a way that, you
know, I'm proud of.
Thanks.
 PROBST: Becky.
 You know, I came into this
game knowing that I'm not going
to be the strongest person, nor
the fastest, you know, or the
smartest, and knew that I would
have to, you know, basically
rely on my social game and the
way I can connect with people.
And I wanted to form an alliance
with people that I trusted, that
I knew that, you know, if I gave
my word and they gave their word
I could count on that.
I've really tried to play the
social game-- being fair, being
honest to the best of my
abilities, and I'm true to my
character.
So that's why I'm asking for
your vote tonight.
 PROBST: Ozzy.
 From the beginning of this
game I was the underdog, you
know?
My people were voted out the
first tribe.
And I found myself in a position
that was really scary.
But I never let that stop me.
And I said, you know, "Hey, I'm
here to play a game and just try
as hard as I can and do whatever
I can."
And that came down to providing,
you know?
I knew that if I didn't fish, if
I didn't go out and provide for
people, that my ass was gone.
That was the bottom line.
You know, I never tried to hide
who I was or what I was or how
strong I was.
You know, I came out here and I
embraced every aspect of this
game wholeheartedly with my soul
in every single moment that I
possibly could.
I think that my actions and my
reputation in this game speaks
louder than any words I'm going
to be able to.
 PROBST: All right, jury, in a
moment you're going to get your
first chance to address them.
I'll give you a minute to think
about what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right, jury, it's
now your turn to address Yul,
Becky, and Ozzy, gather
information to help you make a
million dollar decision.
Nate, get us started.
 Snap.
Well, first of all, I got to
give you guys some props,
really.
Congratulate yourself on how you
did the game.
Yul, I'm going to kind of put
you in my light of godfather.
You played it like the big
gangster boss.
I don't know, brother, but
you're very intelligent.
You kind of sat back, and you
played the game completely
smart.
Ozzy, you are the other side of
the coin, my brother.
You I see as, like, the warrior
kind of style, you know?
And that was apparent in
challenges.
But I want to see how you from a
strategy point played the game
better than Yul.
 I believe the very first
third of this game I played an
incredibly pivotal role in
deciding the ultimate fate of
the game.
I found myself in the position
early on of being the Yul of my
tribe.
I was the one who convinced my
tribe to throw the challenge to
get Billy voted off.
I said, "You know, guys, Billy's
taking us all down."
And I was of the one who was
controlling things.
And then once we merged, I
relied on myself over anybody
else.
And, you know, maybe I did play
up the fact that, "Yeah, bro,
I'm a surfer dude.
Don't worry about me.
I'll provide the fish, and I'll
be chill, man."
You know, so I played that.
I played that as much as
possible.
So the strategy point for me, it
worked because I just relied on
myself, and it got me as far as
here.
 Respect.
All right, Becky, you've got the
mob boss and the warrior.
Why do you deserve a million
dollars over these two?
 I know that I was lucky to be
with the people that I was
aligned with.
But whenever you say that Yul
was the puppet master, you don't
know all the conversations that
we had on every decision that we
were going to make.
We decided together.
Like, it wasn't making Yul
making decisions by himself when
you say that he was the
godfather.
 PROBST: Satisfied?
 No.
I'm being real.
I'm not satisfied.
It's a million dollars right
now, you know?
Becky, are you saying that you
ran it?
Were you the boss?
 No.
That's my point.
I don't think there was a boss.
We seriously were able to go to
the final four because we relied
on each other, and we worked
together and made decisions
together.
And, like, I know that from the
jury's point of view, seeing how
I played, I played
conservatively.
I didn't take risks.
But the biggest risk I think
that I personally took was when
I rejected the idol the night
before tribal council.
Yul offered me the idol to save
my butt.
And I said no, because I didn't
want to slide into the top
three.
I wanted to earn it.
 Cool.
 PROBST: Thanks, Nate.
Jenny.
 My question is directed to
Yul.
What do you think is more
important in winning this game,
the physical element or the
strategical element?
 Clearly in my case I think is
a game about social strategy.
I mean, again, if it was all
about physical survival skills
or physical challenges, it would
be a very different game.
And I was happy to let Ozzy set
himself up as a huge target,
which he did.
And that deflected a lot of
attention away from me.
So it was all part of strategy.
And the ultimate outcome here is
everyone in my tribe made the
final four.
 I respect that.
Good luck to all three of you.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Parvati.
 Congrats.
You earned your spots up there
tonight.
Beckers, I was floored last
night that you would put
yourself in a position of going
up against Sundra in a fire-
making challenge.
And now I just find out that you
declined the idol from Yul.
But you're sitting between
giants right now.
And I want to you convince me
that you want to win this game.
 I wouldn't have been able to
accept that idol and sit here
proud.
I think I would have cheated my
way.
You know, that's not who I am.
I'm not a sneaky person.
For me I never wanted to regret
making the decisions that I
made.
And I wanted to win it the way
that... you know, that I am
proud.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Pavarti.
Rebecca, you're up.
Hi.
Congratulations to all three of
you.
My question is to Yul and Ozzy.
Right now I'm pretty much torn
between the two of you.
Yul, I thought the strategically
you were flawless in playing
this game.
Ozzy, you were flawless in every
challenge.
I need both of you to kind of
tell me something that I don't
know that will help me decide
why you deserve the money, Yul.
 One of the main reasons I
wanted to even be on Survivor
was the fact that minorities
were underrepresented in the
media.
Like, when I grew up I didn't
see any people that looked like
me on TV.
And whenever you see a lot of
minorities on TV they're just
kind of caricatures.
I wanted America to see Asian
American men as they truly are.
And if I do win this game, you
know, I'd want to be very
visible spokesperson for talking
about how we can move forward
and try to get more minorities
represented on TV.
 Okay.
Thank you.
Ozzy?
 In line with Yul, you know, I
have very similar interests and
goals.
And that is changing the
stereotypes and classic image
of, "Hey, what's a Mexican?"
The opportunity to be able to
come out here and to dominate in
a lot of different aspects I
think is really going to change
the perception of what is a
Mexican.
And this is a Mexican right
here.
So using my position, I think
that I can become a positive
role model for any kind of kid
out there, you know?
And I think that we have the
opportunity right now to change
the world a little bit.
So...
 Thank you from the two of
you.
That helped me a lot.
 PROBST: Thanks, Rebecca.
Adam?
 I think you four, the three
of you and Sundra, have been
painfully boring through tribal
councils.
And I want you to get to the
point.
Just want to start off by saying
that.
For Ozzy, I want to you talk
trash about these two.
I really do.
I don't want you talk anything
about you.
I want to you talk some trash
about these two.
Why they shouldn't win it.
Not about you.
 All right.
Well, I'll start with Yul.
I know that Yul didn't work as
hard as he could.
I just think that one of the
worst things you can do is not
try as hard as possible.
And that's something that I
think that Yul might have done.
For Becky, I think that a lot of
it was Becky riding on
coattails.
And the fire making?
The fire making is that
something that after 39 days
you've got to be able to do.
 Okay.
That's fine.
 PROBST: Thanks, Adam.
Candice.
 First of all, I think the
fact that you guys made it after
the infamous mutiny, I think
it's cool, even though I'm not
sitting over there.
My question goes to Yul.
Whenever you're asked a question
you kind of beat around the bush
if you don't want to answer it.
You know, you'll say what people
want to hear.
I don't want to give you the
opportunity to do that again
tonight.
So I'm going to ask you a yes or
no question.
I want to be very clear if you
say anything other than yes or
no...
 Got it.
 ...I will not vote for you.
 Got it.
 That's all I want to hear.
 All right, all right.
 My impression is that you
have been shamelessly working
this jury.
Is that true?
( laughter )
 Yes.
 Thank you.
That was tough for you, I know.
 Well, shamelessly is...
 No, no.
I answered yes or no.
I answered yes or no.
I answered yes or no.
 I'm going to have to think
about that one.
You broke the rules.
 PROBST: Thanks, Candice.
Brad.
 Kudos to all three of you.
Seriously, congratulations.
Ozzy, I've pretty much had,
like, 15-second conversation
with you in my entire life.
I want to know what has been the
most challenging experience in
your life, and how did you
overcome that?
 The most challenging
experience in my life would
probably be the relationship
that I have with my father.
For whatever reason, the man
just can't be around, and
doesn't want to take
responsibility.
So I'm the one who's had to
always had to make the effort to
try to get to know him and to
try and know my family in
Mexico.
I love my family more than
anything.
But my father just has never
been there for me.
And to not have that as a kid,
it's just a different thing to
know that the person that
created you doesn't want you
around, or whatever.
Anyway, it's the hardest
experience.
 Wow, thank you for that.
Thank you for sharing that.
Thanks, guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Brad.
Sundra.
 My people.
The thing that I wanted to ask
you guys is what is one thing
that you have either discovered
about yourself, discovered about
life in general, from being in
this game all the way up to day
freakin' 39.
I'll start with Ozzy.
 Pure love.
There's absolutely nothing here
except for your mind, your soul,
your body, what you can do with
mother nature.
And just learning to love
unconditionally.
And I don't want to sound like a
hippie-dippy patchouli-stinkin'
hippie.
It's really just about loving
and cherishing every single
moment.
 Becky.
 I mean, when I first got here
I kept asking, "What time is it?
What time do you think it is?"
And they'd be like, "Dude, why
do you care?"
I've always been a person who
has everything set by the time
and by the minute.
And everything is always
scheduled.
And just letting everything go,
it was very scary to me, because
those are things that I felt had
always defined me.
I definitely have learned how to
take a moment for myself.
Being here in this moment I've
finally been able to appreciate
that.
 Yul.
 I think the one thing I've
really realized is just kind of
a newfound kind of self
confidence in myself.
You know, I came here with a lot
of fears, a lot of self doubt, a
lot of anxieties.
And just to know that I could
make it through all the way, I
really feel that I now believe
in myself that I can do what I
really feel passionate about.
 Well, I want to say it was a
pleasure, because I think you
guys are intelligent and
beautiful people, and I love you
guys, truly.
And good luck.
 PROBST: Jonathan.
 Guys, congratulations.
It's been my pleasure to play
the game, and honestly, I'm
thrilled for the three of you,
you played hard, you played
well, you played me-- okay,
shame on me.
Yul, brilliant man, very polite
person.
And polite is sort of the other
half of the word of politic.
Certainly you are a civic-minded
person.
You could conceive even of
running for office.
So, Yul, your future
constituents have watched the
season, because they're thinking
of voting for you.
Explain to people who would vote
for you how telling half truths,
which were also half lies, keeps
in line with your integrity,
good intentions, and your
ability to serve them in the
future.
 I think what you said is
absolutely true.
I have done a lot of deceiving
in this game, a lot of
manipulation.
But Survivor is a game,
obviously.
Everyone here came in the game
knowing what the game was about.
If I was outside this game, I
would never do this to
unsuspecting people.
Look-- I have the ability and I
have the technique to manipulate
people.
But if you look at the overall
game, you know, I've stayed true
to the original people that I
made alliances with.
Anyway, I hope that answers your
question.
 It did, very well.
Thank you.
Ozzy, you are obviously
extraordinarily talented, with
the enviable ability to win at
these challenges and do almost
supernatural things, or at least
superhuman things.
On occasion I have found you
arrogant, I have found you with
an attitude of entitlement.
You act as if you are a prince
to me.
No, I mean that honestly.
I'm a little uncomfortable
giving million dollars to a 25-
year-old kid that I perceive as
having some issues of
entitlement, okay?
What I'd like to hear from you
is how is giving you a million
dollars going to make you a
better person, your world a
better place, and, in fact, my
world a better place.
Please.
 If I had a million dollars,
honestly, Jonathan, I would go
back to school.
Because going to school has been
very hard for me, because I've
had to pay for it myself.
So the first thing I would do is
complete a higher education with
money that I don't necessarily
have to worry about owing to
somebody else.
After the schooling I would love
to just be able to try and
change the world for the better,
honestly.
 Thank you, guys.
 PROBST: All right.
We'll give the jury a moment to
think about what they've heard,
then we will vote.
 PROBST: All right.
It's time to get to the vote.
Tonight it's a little different.
Tonight you want to see your
name on the parchment.
Jury, you are voting for a
winner.
Let's get to the vote.
Brad, you're up.
 I admire you all tremendously
in the game that you played.
But Yul outplayed you all.
 The ultimate competitor.
The fire that you've brought to
this game completely captivated
me.
I think that you played your
heart out.
You totally deserve to win this
game.
 PROBST: For the last time,
I'll go get the votes.
It's been a long 39 days.
I know you would love for me to
read these votes right now.
Unfortunately, you're going to
have to wait until we get home.
See you there.
( cheers and applause )
 PROBST: All right, nice
welcome.
Glad everybody's so
enthusiastic.
Well, I have to say to you guys
that, for my money, one of the
most enjoyable seasons we have
had in quite a while.
And for a show that's been on 13
seasons now, that is saying
something.
And that is a real credit to
everybody here on the stage, and
also the other survivors that
were voted out earlier.
You guys gave us some great
moments in your pursuit of a
million dollars.
But it comes down to this.
Final three-- Yul, Becky, Ozzy.
Nine votes.
You want to see your name
tonight.
At stake, title of sole survivor
and a check for a million
dollars.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Yul.
( cheers and applause )
Ozzy.
( cheers and applause )
One vote Yul, one vote Ozzy.
Yul.
( cheers and applause )
Two votes Yul, one vote Ozzy.
Yul.
( cheers and applause )
Three votes Yul, one vote Ozzy.
Ozzy.
( cheers and applause )
Three votes Yul, two votes Ozzy.
Ozzy.
( cheers and applause )
We are tied.
Three votes Yul, three votes
Ozzy.
Ozzy.
( cheers and applause )
Ozzy now in the lead.
Four votes Ozzy, three votes
Yul.
Yul.
( cheers and applause )
So we are tied-- four votes Yul,
four votes Ozzy, one vote left.
Which means Becky is now the
wild card.
If this vote is for Becky, we
have a tie.
( laughter )
The vote is not for Becky.
Becky is out of the game.
We are now down to two people--
Yul, who dominated strategically
like maybe nobody else ever has.
Ozzy, who dominated physically,
fair to say like nobody ever
has.
It comes down to one vote left.
The winner of Survivor: Cook
Islands...
Yul.
( cheers and applause )
 You look good in your suit.
 How are you?
Nice to meet you.
 Yul, congratulations, really.
