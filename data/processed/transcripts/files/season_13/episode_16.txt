 --- 

         Yul is brilliant.
He's like Mr. Harvard, Yale,
Stanford guy.
And he's also really, really
strong.
 I'm asking you for both of
our sakes to become my ally
again.
It's a little bit weird for me
because I feel like I'm kind of
like the godfather or something








arranging a hit on somebody.
I don't know if I'm entirely
comfortable with it.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Cook Islands reunion
show.
We are live in Hollywood where
Yul has just won a million
dollars in a very close,
dramatic vote.
You know, I kind of said it
before as we read the votes, but
I've got to acknowledge both of
you guys, with all due respect








to Becky as well, for doing so
well.
But you two dominated this game.
You deserved to be in the final
two.
It's the first time I've ever
felt bad that somebody didn't
win, in the case of Ozzy.
I mean I'm happy for you, Yul,
but it was so evenly matched.
( applause )
It was really great.
 He deserves it.
 PROBST: Agreed.
Yul, let's go through some of
the keys.
Because in looking back over the
season, you did so many things
right to keep you in the power
position of the game.
You absolutely deserved it.
I didn't mean to take anything
away from it.
Going back to the first thing,
finding the idol.
In the totem pole of events,
how big was that?
 It was huge.
I mean, there's a lot of luck
involved in playing this game.
I got sent at the right time.
And I think the key to winning
the game is, you know,
maximizing the good luck and
mitigating the bad luck.
I got sent at the right time.
I found the idol.
And I played it the way I wanted
to play it, which was not to
save my own butt one time, but
to really change the game up.
And we had that opportunity, and
really flipped things on its
head.
So...
 PROBST: Another big moment
that could have destroyed you
and the rest of Aitu was the
mutiny.
What was your first reaction
when you saw Candice and then
Jonathan step off?
 "We're screwed."
I thought that was it.
I mean, they had the numbers,
they had the size.
I didn't realize at the time
what an amazing challenge demon
Ozzy was.
I mean... but at that time I
thought our game was over.
And I thought it was a matter of
trying to come out with, you
know, a good ending for the four
of us.
 PROBST: Candice, why mutiny?
It's a risky move to make in the
middle of the game, with... you
had no idea that was coming.
 Right.
Well, like you had said, you
know, we had chance to change
our fate in the game.
And Jonathan and I had talked at
length about flipping back over
eventually.
I had already talked to Nate
about working with Adam, Nate,
Parvati.
And so, you know, it was just a
chance of a lifetime, and I
thought we could make it, and we
could get to the end.
And it didn't work out.
But it was fun.
 PROBST: It's really how you
have to play this game, though,
to have a shot.
You have to make big moves and
never quit making them.
Sundra, what was it?
Because at that point I remember
the four of you, the looks on
your faces as you looked over at
this other group of eight, I
think.
You thought it was over.
What was it about this foursome
that bonded you?
Because many other people might
have just splintered and said,
"I'm out on my own now."
 Yeah.
You know, I think it's just the
luck of having four great people
together who have a similar
objective in mind, which is, you
know, "I want to play this game.
I want to play this game with as
much integrity as I can.
And you know what?
We're going to do this, because
this is all that we have."
And I think it was just the
right people.
It could have been... if it was
one other person who had the
wrong mindset, it wouldn't have
worked the way it did, and it
wouldn't have played out as
beautifully as it did.
 PROBST: Yul, another big key
was how you managed to lure
Jonathan back.
Take me through that.
What did you say to him?
How did you convince him?
You were always running numbers.
Out on the show, Yul was
constantly going, "We have a
33.3% chance of this happening."
( laughter )
Did you do that with Jonathan?
 Yeah.
I think there were a couple of
things.
I mean, I knew he's a very
rational player and he's a
really smart guy.
And I thought he could be able
to really kind of appreciate a
rational argument.
So I came up with this whole
argument where I said, "If you
don't flip over to our side,
probability-wise we'll be able
to execute a strategy by which
you'll be out in the next two
rounds.
So really you have no choice."
And the other thing I told him
was... I was afraid he might
come around and try to lie to us
and, you know, end up voting
against us.
And I told him... it was a
stretch on my part, but I said
the only reason he hasn't been
voted out of his tribe so far
was because they all suspected
that he had the idol.
So if they found out that he
really didn't have the idol he'd
be booted, you know, over the
next round.
So that was my insurance to make
sure he didn't come and flip
over on us.
 PROBST: So that's huge.
That gives you... at a point
where the numbers could have
gone either way, that gives you
the numbers.
Then, amazingly, you use
Jonathan in voting Jonathan out
as a way to potentially help you
win this game.
Adam, you were instrumental in
that.
You come over and make a deal.
And I want to make sure I'm
clear on this.
You said to Yul that, "If you
get rid of Jonathan before me or
Parvati," that "I'll give you my
vote in the end"?
 Exactly.
And if not I would have voted
for Ozzy.
So...
 PROBST: And did you keep your
word?
 Yep.
 PROBST: So, yeah, Ozzy, did
you know?
Let me make sure I set this up
right, so that... in case this
isn't making sense.
The situation is Jonathan has
now betrayed both camps.
Yul is now sitting in the power
position of this game.
Adam comes in, "Guess what?
If you vote Jonathan out,
because I don't like him, let me
and Parvati stay a day longer,
I'll give you a vote at the
final tribal council."
That's a million dollar vote, as
it turns out in tonight's vote.
Did you know that was going on?
 Well, Adam had mentioned a
little bit of that, saying that,
you know, he had promised Yul
that he was going to vote for
him because of that decision.
But I think the thing that Adam
didn't really realize at the
time it wasn't really Yul's
decision.
Us as a four had made that
decision already.
 PROBST: That's my point.
 Right.
 PROBST: He benefits.
 So I did not... I really
didn't know that Yul had
promised... you know, promised
the vote for Jonathan.
And I tried to explain to Adam
that, no, you know, that in fact
was not the case, that us as a
four had already made the
decision.
So a little too late, I guess.
 PROBST: And another credit to
you, Yul, for doing something
that I don't think people
realized you were doing, which
was playing everybody so... in
such subtle ways.
It's a tiny little maneuver, but
seemed to pay off.
How instrumental was Becky...
when I was out there, I don't
hear a lot of what goes on in
the beach.
I saw Becky often as being a
tagalong.
When I was at home watching the
show, I realized she was with
you on a lot of these decisions.
 Absolutely.
Yeah, Becky is an incredibly
strong player.
And I think even when you watch
the season you don't appreciate
all the subtle moves that she
made.
I mean, she was an equal partner
in everything that we did.
At some point people started
calling me the puppet master.
And I was trying to convince
them I'm not the puppet master.
I mean, the way I like to work
with a group is to build
consensus.
But at some point I realize they
think I'm, you know, BS-ing
about it.
So fine.
If you think I'm the puppet
master, I'll take that and use
it to my advantage.
But the truth is Becky was with
me every step of the way.
We worked together, we
collaborated together, we
strategized together.
 PROBST: Becky, is it a little
frustrating knowing how
instrumental you were that you
will probably be remembered for
not being able to start fire
after 38 days?
( laughter )
 We practiced.
We really, really did.
We practiced.
And I think we were both really,
really nervous.
And also being against somebody
who you're... you know, we were
friends, really close friends.
And, I mean, it wasn't shown how
we were actually sharing and
trying to help each other out.
But that was the whole reason
why I think we went so far
together, is because of that
trust, that bond.
 PROBST: A lot of questions I
get on the streets are about you
and Yul.
Like, because you had such a
special bond.
Was it ever romantic?
Did you ever consider it being
romantic, or are we crazy?
 I think both of us are very
focused, and when we're in this
game, the whole time we weren't
thinking outside the box.
We were thinking just about
strategy and the game.
And we knew that our best chance
of going as far as we could
would be to stay together, stay
aligned.
So we didn't cross that line.
We are really good friends.
 PROBST: Did it enter your
mind?
( laughter )
 No.
It didn't enter my mind.
 PROBST: Okay.
There's something else I want to
share, because this was news to
me, Yul.
There's the other side of Yul
which is People magazine...
there it is.
In the "Sexiest Man" issue,
there's Yul.
So is your life changing a
little, Yul?
Are you getting dates?
 Honestly, when I heard about
this I thought it was a
practical joke.
I was like, "No."
I mean, honestly.
But I think it's a little bit
silly.
But I appreciate it.
And I think my mom would be
happy.
I think she just wants me to get
married, and she's hoping this
will help find me a wife.
 PROBST: Here is something
that occurred to me, and I don't
know if it did to anybody else.
But toward the end when you were
in the hot tub with Pavarti and
Ozzy, two uninhibited and naked
people, I couldn't tell if this
was...
 He was naked, too.
 PROBST: Right.
But here's my question.
I couldn't tell if this was to
Yul, "This is a great moment,"
or, "This is my worst
nightmare."
( laughter )
Which was it?
 I think it was more the
latter.
I wanted to get the hell out of
there.
But I didn't want to give them
an opportunity to strategize.
So I wanted to keep my eye on
Parvati.
I waited until Ozzy fell asleep
that night, then I went to bed.
 PROBST: What's the first
thing you did when you got home?
 I got a Costco membership and
I went crazy.
 PROBST: Buying food?
 Buying food.
I bought so much food it
wouldn't fit in my fridge.
And I just sat there, "I guess
I've got to eat it now."
So I just chowed down.
( laughter )
 PROBST: All right.
Well, he climbed coconut trees,
he caught fish and he swam like
one, and he was virtually
unbeatable in the challenges.
Where did this Ozzy guy come
from?
Plus, love him or hate him,
Everybody has an opinion about
Jonathan, including Jonathan.
Ozzy and Jonathan are next on
the Survivor: Cook Islands
Reunion show.
But first, this is why the Cook
Islands are one of the most
beautiful locations we've ever
been to.
 PROBST: Go!
Ozzy already up with the
island names and heading back.
 Man!
 Ozzy is amazing.
He's like half animal, half man.
 PROBST: Go, Ozzy!
 Part fish, part monkey.
 Ozzy!
 PROBST: Ozzy swimming like a
dolphin as he makes up time.
 He's kind of like a little
jungle boy, you know, climbing
these coconut trees and getting
coconuts down, getting fish.
 I think we should call him
Poseidon now or something.
 Yes.
 I mean, Ozzy, he's just Ozzy.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Cook Islands reunion
show.
We are live.
Ozzy, "born to play" is a phrase
that we kept using even when we
were out on the island with you.
What... where did you come from?
How do you end up with all these
bizarre skills so suited
for Survivor?
 It's... I just had a very
eclectic background.
I love books.
And one of the first books that
I remember reading was Robinson
Crusoe.
And that just sparked an
interest in...
 PROBST: But how did you learn
to swim like that and spear fish
and climb a coconut tree?
 Well, it all started with
just swimming.
We had a pool in our backyard
when I lived in San Antonio,
Texas, and I just swam every
day.
Like, I honestly feel like I was
born in the water, that I
learned how to swim before I
could walk.
I mean, it's something that I've
always loved.
And I felt more comfortable in
the water than on land.
And so that just is the
foundation for everything that
really happens in Survivor.
 PROBST: And so you knew how
to spear fish?
You had done this
before Survivor?
 Well, I had gone out a few
years ago with one of my buddies
on his... it was on his
birthday.
He took me out spear fishing,
just showed me the ropes.
And this is in Santa Barbara,
Devereaux Point, yeah.
( laughter )
Went out there one day when
there was no waves and he showed
me how to do it.
And I just fell in love with it.
Just the survival aspect of it
just really, really spoke to me.
 PROBST: What was the best
part for you of this time out
there?
 Man, the best part, honestly,
the whole damn thing.
Everything.
I mean, just meeting all these
great people and just being out
there and knowing that if the
situation happened and I was
stranded on a deserted island,
which I had fantasized about
ever since I was a little kid,
and it finally came true... and
just to know that all of these
childhood hobbies finally came
to fruit, and everything that I
did as a kid and was really
interested in, I finally was
able to use.
And I didn't think I would
actually do that.
So...
 PROBST: Did you miss this
when you left it?
 Honestly, I think I fell into
a deep depression when I got
back, and just... everything...
the concrete jungle kind of got
to me a little bit.
And being out there and being in
the ... being at humanity's
roots, you know, it was an
amazing experience.
Because it's getting back to a
primal nature that a lot of us
have totally disconnected from.
And we're here and we're
surrounded by lights, cameras,
and we don't have an idea of
where we came from, you know?
And not more than a few thousand
years ago we were all doing the
survivor thing.
So...
 PROBST: One other question,
because I think you touched a
lot of people when you shared
the story with your dad.
Do you know... is your dad
watching tonight?
Have you been in touch with him?
 Honestly I don't know.
But my father is here.
( applause )
 PROBST: We need to clear that
up, be clear on that.
Your father that... the person
you consider your father.
 Yeah.
He raised me, you know?
And I love him.
( applause )
 PROBST: Well, as memorable as
Ozzy was for his honesty and
obviously his physical
domination, Jonathan was equally
memorable, but for very
different reasons.
 Oh, my favorite!
I'm here to win a million... a
million dollars.
It's you, me, Becky and that's
it.
I thought you and I had a tight
thing.
Do we not trust each other?
I mean, what am I going to say,
I promise?
What's that worth to you?
I'm the wandering Jew without a
tribe.
Either I'll have betrayed the
Raro people and I'm a complete
bastard...
I consider myself a loyal person
...or I didn't jump over to the
Aitu people, and I'm a complete
bastard.
 Well, Jonathan, you're a rat
because you betrayed everybody
in this game.
 That's bollocks, and you know
it.
( belching )
( laughter )
 PROBST: Jonathan, this is a
debate with people I run into.
Were you a villain or were you
just a good player?
Do you think you were a villain?
 No.
I mean, I think I was
antagonistic to other people,
and obviously I rubbed them the
wrong way.
But it was a game.
You know, you can't have a
villain in a ga... there's no
villain in Monopoly, you know?
( laughter )
I mean, honestly, no, we're all
playing the game.
There's no villain in a poker
tournament, you know?
So I was playing to win a
million bucks.
We all were.
I was a lot more overt about it,
and I think I wore my agenda on
my sleeve.
 PROBST: What was the family
reaction?
Because you took a lot of hits,
and you're probably watching
with this the wife and your
kids.
 Well, I warned them that I
was going to be called some
fantastic names.
( laughter )
You know, and they're like,
"What do you mean, Dad?"
And I'm like, "Oh, cancer and
rat and weasel, you know."
So that sucked.
But so I warned them.
And I basically said you get
called names, so what?
We don't call people names.
You know, when you get called
names, you pick yourself up, you
get bullied.
And the truth is that it was in
the context of a game.
I know that the people who
called me names wouldn't do that
outside the context of the game.
They were trying to progress
their game, too.
And I don't hold that against
them.
Some of them went further than
me.
Some of them didn't go further
than me.
But, you know, we were all
playing a game out there.
 PROBST: Did this change you?
Physically you lost a lot of
weight, and you've kept it off.
Did it change you in other ways?
 Yes.
I feel much more appreciative of
the life that I have, of my
family, of people who would not
say things to me, and who love
me just for who I am, exactly
who I am as a complex person.
And that makes me extremely glad
that I did this.
( applause )
 PROBST: Very nicely said.
Jenny, you and Rebecca got to be
a little frustrated because you
guys were both voted off before
Jonathan, who is the guy that
then comes back and betrays all
the people that voted you out.
Worst nightmare for you, Jenny,
seeing that bottle that Parvati
read saying you're going to vote
somebody...
 Are you kidding?
Yeah.
It was not fun, according to
Parvati's words.
You know, I regret not saying
anything at tribal, because I
think that if I just stopped you
and said, "Jeff, can I just say
one thing, please, in case it's
going to be me..."
 PROBST: You might have been
able to plead your case?
 Yeah.
And I would plead my case and
convince them that I was going
to be the better choice.
Because I think after that merge
I'm sure maybe Yul would try to
convince me to go with them, and
I wouldn't have flipped.
 PROBST: A lesson for you
future survivors-- speak up at
tribal council.
Okay, he made headaches go away
and red dots appear.
He offended people with his
ethnic jokes.
And he was a true original.
Cao Boi is next.
Plus, we started the season by
dividing the tribes based on
ethnicity.
Was it a good idea or not?
We will ask the people who lived
it.
And playing us to the break is
Sekou.
He was first off, but so
enthusiastic, he wrote a song
about Survivor.
He is sitting in with our
favorite Survivor composers
David and Russell and the
Survivor house band.
Take it.
 ♪ Well it's time
to say farewell
to all your family and friends
♪ Are you ready for the game
to begin
♪ You start to wonder
if you stand a chance to win
Survivor! ♪
Come on, everybody, sing!
♪ Survivor. ♪
Come on, everybody, clap your
hands.
♪ Survivor. ♪
 PROBST: Cao Boi had his own
system.
 I've never been accepted by
the Asian community.
I belong in a hippie community.
instead.
There, you'll feel better now.
Your headache will be gone in a
few minutes.
 I did have a headache.
I don't have a headache anymore.
But I do have a red dot on my
forehead.
 What do you call a Vietnamese
with three dogs?
 We get it, but a lot of
people won't get it.
 Typically in life I'm either
hated or I'm loved.
I am often misunderstood, but a
lot of people will come to
understand that I mean well.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
live Survivor: Cook Islands
reunion show.
Yul has just won a check for a
million dollars.
Cao Boi, it's kind of the same
question I asked Ozzy.
Where do you come from?
You too are this crazy mixture
of elements.
 You know what, Jeff?
I've been thinking so hard on
this.
People ask me, "What are you,
what have you learned from
this?"
All my live I've bucked the
trends.
And I've been chastised, I've
been beaten down, I've been told
that "You are doing things
wrong.
You've got to do it this way.
You've got to do it this way.
You've got to walk here, go A
and B and C and D."
No, I've been living it my way.
And guess what?
I'm here.
This is the culmination of my
life experience.
 PROBST: I asked you on the
show if you were typically
understood or misunderstood.
Do people tend to just not get
you at first?
 Well, they don't think I
speak English.
At first, "Do you understand
English?"
And if I just look at them, they
say it louder.
( laughter )
 PROBST: You made comment to
me out there about young people
and your philosophy of traveling
around the world and the country
that you don't think kids today
are patient enough.
 Things are just quicker.
It's a quicker pace.
I mean, I'm from old school.
I double check and triple count
everything.
Kids nowadays, they look at
something they grab it a lot
quicker.
They can process information a
lot quicker.
And I believe that that actually
create a lot of impatience.
So it's a good way to balance
the old way and new way if you
can do that.
Some people now, they can manage
to do both.
They will be a lot more
successful than having one or
the other.
 PROBST: Another thing Cao Boi
will always be memorable for are
your Asian jokes inside the tent
at night, to which the other
people in your tribe are going,
"Cao Boi, what are you saying?"
I always felt like you were
trying to say "Don't take things
so seriously."
But Yul, the question of whether
we should have done this or
not... we started the season
dividing you based on ethnicity.
Do you think it was a good idea
ultimately?
Because you had some trepidation
in the beginning.
 Honestly, when I first heard
about it, the first thing I
thought to myself was, "I've
made a huge mistake, being on a
reality show that might
potentially play up racial
stereotypes and caricatures."
I've got to say, though, I'm
really happy and proud of what
we were able to accomplish on
the show.
I think hopefully we might have
shown that ultimately it's not
your ethnic background that
dictates who you are and who
your friends are, but really...
you know, we ended up with a
multicultural coalition that got
to the end.
And the fact that we bonded
together was really based on
individual identities and our
values, not so much our cultural
backgrounds.
So I'm hoping that in some small
way we might have shown that,
you know, it's not the color of
your skin that determines who
you are, but it's your inside
self, who you are.
 PROBST: Nate.
( applause )
Now, Nate, Nate, Nate, on the
other end, I read something in
an interview where you and
Stephannie and Rebecca, it
sounded like, were getting into
it, because you didn't represent
your group or take care of your
ethnic group from the beginning.
Give me the short skinny on
that.
 Well, basically we all were
divided by race.
I love all my Hiki tribe, Sekou,
Sundra, everyone.
But I was called a race traitor.
I don't know why.
Because I think some felt I was
obligated to stick with my
racial background regardless.
I was playing a game where
regardless of your color, skin,
you have to help me survive.
It doesn't matter if you're my
background, what have you.
We're playing a game.
Everyone knows how hard it is.
Regardless of, you know, color,
what have you, you have to do
what is best for your team.
And so I had to turn on girls
that I loved and my racial
background.
So, yeah, I got comments of
"race traitor."
 PROBST: Stephannie, what was
that?
 Well, I just felt that, you
know, I was comfortable in the
game.
I thought that I had Hiki love
for Nate.
And I trusted him.
I thought we had very good, very
closer relationship.
 PROBST: But did you trust him
because you're from the same
ethnic group?
 Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I expected him to have my back.
 PROBST: Rebecca... sorry to
interrupt you, Stephannie.
Rebecca, did you team the same
way?
 I trusted Nate more so
because of who he is and our
relationship that we had.
It had nothing to do with the
fact that we're both black.
I expected him to come to me
when I was under the radar
because we were tight.
That was my issue.
And it had no... it didn't
matter what race or nationality
you are.
If we're close, I expected you
to look out for me let me know
something was going on.
That's all.
 PROBST: Brad, wrap this up
for me.
Do you think in general... is
there a pressure to represent
your group when do you something
like this and divide people and
say, "This is your group, your
group, your group"?
 Yeah, there's a huge
pressure, especially when it
comes to representing the Asian
culture.
I think lot of times in media,
men are portrayed as, like,
these waspy, you know, thin sort
of nerdy, bookwormish guys.
And I think Yul and I did
fantastic job of breaking the
mold and breaking the stereotype
that lot of America have today.
So...
 PROBST: All right.
Up next, we're going to be
giving away the keys to a brand
new 2008 Mercury Mariner.
Plus Candice and Adam.
Was it strategy or romance?
We'll find out right after this.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Cook Islands live
reunion show from CBS in
Hollywood.
Candice, was it strategy, was it
romance from the beginning with
you and Adam?
 From the beginning, it was
strategy.
I mean, I didn't come out here
to get into some romantic
relationship.
But, you know, as things went
along, and I knew I could trust
Adam and that he could trust
me... and, you know, we
developed a bond and a
relationship.
And it was... you know, there
was a little romance.
But...
 PROBST: Adam, what's the
status today?
 You know, Candice is a great
girl and...
( laughter )
You know, I couldn't have done
this whole experience without
her, because I really did trust
her.
And we did have that connection
on the island, and it was great,
and, I mean, it was real.
But, you know, we have separate
lives now.
You know, she's on the East
Coast, I'm on the West Coast.
So I think we're more just like
friends now.
 PROBST: Nate and Parvati, the
other couple that when I was out
there, was a little more... it
seemed a little more to me than
we actually saw on the show.
Nate, was there... were there
feelings for Parvati?
 Parvati was... hi, Parvati.
( laughter )
Look at her.
I mean, look at her.
I can't even say anything.
She was warm, you know?
 PROBST: Nate, yes or no?
I feel like we're at tribal
council.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Yes, there were some
feelings.
 Yes, definitely.
 PROBST: Parvati.
Strategy for you?
Was there some... you seemed to
be enjoying Nate's company out
there.
 I love Nate.
I think Nate really helped me
get through the game.
At the low points when Raro kept
losing and losing, and I was
getting so frustrated, Nate
would always make me laugh and
he always picked me up.
And it really helped me out
there.
So yeah, I mean, I depended on
him.
 PROBST: By the way, we
labeled you as a boxer on the
show.
And people are... Parvati, what
kind of boxing do you do?
I don't even know.
 It's called model boxing.
But it's real boxing.
I mean, we train in the gym,
like, five days a week and, I
mean, we're running, we're
sparring.
I'm sparring with guys and girls
both.
We're taking head shots.
You know, it's legitimate
boxing.
It's really quite difficult.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Let's get some
updates in here.
J.P, what's life like after
Survivor for you?
What's going on?
 Well, shortly after
Survivor I got contacted by the
Janice Dickinson modeling
agency, and I'll be... that will
be appearing January tenth on
Oxygen.
( cheers and applause )
 PROBST: Hello, J.P.
Christina, what's the reaction
from your fellow cops to you
being on the show?
Did they respect you more or
less?
 Initially there was the
joking, you know, like anywhere,
because we're like brothers.
And then afterwards that one
scene with the wrestling match,
they were, you know, very
respectful, and were very proud
of me at that point.
But overall I guess it was a
great time, and everyone enjoyed
it at work also, you know?
They watched it while they were
at briefing.
And it was fun for them also.
 PROBST: Cecelia, you weren't
on the show as long as some of
the other people.
Do you still get... does this
still resonate as an experience?
 Definitely.
I mean, even... I know Sekou
could speak to that.
Even being there two days, it
changes you.
When you peel off all the
layers, family, work, friends,
it's who you are at the core
that comes out in that
experience.
And it really is a life-
changing, amazing experience I'm
very happy to have been part of.
 PROBST: Flicka.
The...
 I love you guys!
 PROBST: You know, the hair is
so much a part of your look.
Now, after being on a show like
this I'm sure people recognize
you for the hair.
Does that become something that
now you are, in a way, stuck
with, that you have to keep this
look, because "This is my look"?
 I don't think I'm stuck at
all.
I love my style.
And I just keep on workin' it.
People just come up to me, and I
feel so blessed.
They let their kids come up, and
they approach me and tell me how
much they love me.
And I just have had nothing but
love.
And I'm so appreciative to be
able to have this whole
experience with all these
people, you know?
And my hair is just... it's just
good, I think.
 PROBST: And Billy, I'd be
remiss if I didn't point out the
obvious, that Candice is now
available again.
( laughter and applause )
I've just got to ask you, Billy.
I've just got to ask you.
We're running out of time in
this.
But not to make light of it.
You had genuine feelings.
 I did.
But a lot had to do with the
situation I was in.
Not just with physically.
But also, you know, it was a lot
like, "I don't need you guys, I
found something else."
It was a lot of, like trying to
just get back and finding
something.
So there was a lot of that.
But, you know, you are in the
heat of the moment.
And how many of us haven't stuck
our foot in our mouth at some
point in our lives?
I just happened to do it on
national TV, that's all.
 PROBST: Kudos to you, Billy.
( applause )
All right.
Well, we have something else
exciting to do now.
This season we've been doing a
thing online to vote for the
survivor who played the most
clever game.
The winner gets a 2008 Mercury
Mariner.
Got a little video of that
running now right out here on
our red carpet.
Once again this vote was
extremely close.
And it came down to, of course,
Yul and Ozzy.
And we'll tell you this, that
there were a lot of votes cast.
And it was consistent throughout
the voting.
The difference was less than 1%
in the votes.
This time the winner was Ozzy.
Congratulations.
( cheers and applause )
We'll take a break.
When we come back we'll show you
where Survivor is headed to
next.
 PROBST: Welcome back to
Survivor: Cook Islands live
reunion show.
Well, as this season comes to a
close a new season of Survivor
is just around the corner.
Here is a sneak peek.
Coming in the new year,
Survivor turns the tables on
two tribes as one lives the life
of luxury while the other is
left with virtually nothing.
For the first time there will be
19 new survivors.
This diverse cast with
lifestyles ranging from a
Harvard-educated lawyer to
once-homeless street performer
will be forced to battle each
other more fiercely than ever
before.
Crawling with thousands of
deadly sea snakes, Exile Island
will be more treacherous than
ever.
This time two hidden immunity
idols and a twist will
drastically complicate the game.
And one of the most
controversial decisions ever
made by a survivor will have
America talking.
Who will outwit, outplay and
outlast all the others?
Join us next time for the
premiere of Survivor: Fiji.
Tomorrow morning on The Early
Show on CBS, Yul will receive
his check for one million
dollars.
You can own a piece of Survivor:
Cook Islands by bidding on
one-of-a-kind memorabilia to
benefit the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
The Web site is on the screen
now.
Add if you think you really have
what it takes to do what these
guys just did and be on the
Thanks for hanging in there with
us for 13 seasons.
We will see you in Fiji.
Good night.
( applause )
