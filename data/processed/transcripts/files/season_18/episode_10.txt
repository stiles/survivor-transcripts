 PROBST: Previously on Survivor:  at the newly merged Forza tribe... ...former Timbira members
Coach and Tyson put together an alliance.  That's what I'm talking about, man.
 All right.  PROBST: And they targeted one of their own. While Sierra and Brendan also
tried to pull in the Jalapao Three.  I think we go after Coach.  Okay.
 PROBST: Setting the stage for a showdown between Brendan and Coach.  We're cutting the head off
the dragon and sending Brendan home. When it comes head-to-head, we'll see who really was the
Chosen One.  PROBST: And the old Jalapao tribe found themselves in an unlikely position.
At the immunity challenge: Getting down to it, it is Brendan and Tyson. Tyson won his second immunity
in a row. And at Tribal Council, Brendan thought his plan was in the bag. If anybody has the hidden
immunity idol, and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. And didn't play his idol.
Brendan. The old Jalapao tribe sided with Coach's alliance. Eighth person voted out and the
first member of our jury: Brendan. Blindsiding Brendan, and leaving Sierra in an alliance of one.
Brendan, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 So how awesome was that?  Awesome!  Sierra, you got to admit.  Yeah, you guys are...
 Pretty badass.  I mean, obviously, I know I'm the next one to go, so let's just try to make these next
couple days congenial, I guess. I mean... Whatever. That sucked.
It was probably the worst night I've ever had out here. And right now I'm just tired and kind of hurt, and I kind of just
want to disappear. Can I please have a conversation with you, Coach?  Yes.
 Thank you. I don't think I'm a bad person for writing Coach's name down. Although, it was a very hard
choice to make. I have never planned on ever voting for you. And I'm being 100% honest with
you.  Every decision you made was bad. You could have written down
anybody else's in this game that doesn't have the character like I have.  You're right.
 Everybody out here has lied except for me. Um, I knew that Sierra would want to assuage her guilt,
massage it. Make herself feel rationalized and justified inside. That's what we do when we make
poor decisions in life. But you have to realize something. In war, and love and war...
 Mm-hmm.  ...it's kill or be killed. So you pitted yourself against me.
Brendan pitted himself against me. Who deserves to go next? Captioning sponsored by
CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION (theme song playing) ♪ ♪
 I came down to the water early this morning to celebrate the victory over Brendan. Throughout the entire
meditation, there was this feeling of peace that just kind of settled over me and permeated my every fiber.
For me to pit myself against somebody who is younger, that is faster than me, and maybe stronger than me, although I
bench-press 300 pounds. And we were talking two days ago and he was like, "Really?" 'Cause he doesn't do that.
To defeat a worthy opponent like that, at this stage in the game-- the piece de résistance. The dragonslayer has vanquished
the dragon once and for all. (shouts) Over! The battle has already been won.
Victory is mine.
 Well, it just all started with the way that I started off as a rocky start and I latched on to someone else.
I guess I was blinded, so I'm not even going to say that I wasn't.  Tribal Council went as
planned. Brendan didn't have a clue it was coming. And, uh, Sierra was really
shocked. Stephen and I-- we've actually put ourselves in a really good position.
And actually, Stephen and I could've decided who went home last night, and we decided to stick through with the warrior
alliance. And Stephen and I, we're happy with the way things are going. We're happy to see Sierra go
next.  I guess the unfortunate part is I didn't make any choices in it, and I followed along.
 But that's out of your character.  Right.  You say stuff, you know what
I mean? You jump into any conversation about anything.  He was holding the idol, so,
therefore, I was playing...  The most powerful thing is friends.  After last night at Tribal
Council, I guess I'm kind of pleading for my life. What sucks the most is that I was on top of the game
yesterday. And then today, I'm, like, at the bottom of the food chain. But I'm not going to just roll
over and die. I'm sorry that I made bad choices.  Okay.
 Everyone's had moments of betrayal, but I wasn't about to go on some massacre against you.
And I wasn't about to go on some massacre against Coach, and...  I like to see Sierra scramble and mope.
Uh, I think it's funny because I've never liked Sierra. To me, she's of no worth. I mean, her parents probably
love her. I can't imagine her boyfriend's that cool. The thing is, the most important
thing here is trust.  I agree with that.  And you know what? It's... everybody here in camp
right now, I get along with. And I don't feel like anybody's a snake waiting to bite me. And you keep scrambling and you
keep backpedaling, and you keep making excuses about how you didn't know. So you can scramble all you
want...  I'm not trying to scramble, Tyson. I'm trying to explain my side
so it doesn't look like I was the mastermind behind it.  I don't think you were the mastermind.
I don't think you're smart enough for it. Like, really.  That's fine.
 If I would have lost the challenge yesterday, who would you have voted for?  That was undecided.
I was... as far...  Who would you have voted for?  J.T.  Wrong.
 That's where my head was at.  Brendan would have come to you and told you to vote for me.  And I probably would have
done it.  Okay, you probably would have, and that's what I'm saying right now.
 Okay.  Okay? And I'm going to be straight up, 100% honest with you right now.
You're going to be the next to go. You're not going to be able to change that.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yeah.
 Yeah.  PROBST: For today's challenge you will be divided into two teams of four.
On my go, two members of each team will race out to collect a large puzzle board, then race back, then the next two go.
Once you have all four boards, you must arrange those boards in their own specific spots. Then you will flip and rotate
the boards until all the holes line up, revealing seven vowels. Once you have the seven vowels, you will use the corresponding
tiles on your answer board, along with the tiles of the seven consonants that are given to you.
You'll then combine them all to form a four-word phrase. The winning team will be treated to an afternoon of local
entertainment and local food.  Oh...  PROBST: You will be treated to a performance of capoeira...
 Yes!  PROBST: ...a beautiful Brazilian martial art form that combines dance and music.
It's really pretty spectacular. You will also enjoy a local feast. In addition, the winning team
of four will send one person from the losing team to Exile Island. Worth playing for?
 Yes!  PROBST: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, we have our two
teams. Red team: J.T., Erinn, Debbie, and Tyson. The Black team: Coach, Stephen,
Sierra, and Taj. Nice reward on the line. Survivors ready? Go!
J.T. and Erinn heading out for the Red. Coach and Stephen heading out for the Black team.
 Damn, J.T. is so fast.
 All right, start working on the knots.  PROBST: Untie those boards and get them back.
 Come on.  PROBST: J.T. and Erinn heading back with their board for the Red team.
Coach and Stephen heading back with their first board for the Black team. Now you've got to find the right
spot. Where does that first board go?  The last one.  PROBST: Good!
Taj and Sierra heading out for the Black team. Debbie and Tyson heading out for the Red team.
Taj and Sierra heading back for the Black team with their second board. Taj is wearing that board,
carrying it on her shoulders. Debbie and Tyson racing back with the Red team's second board.
Find the right slot. Get it in and the next pair goes back out.  Not that one.
 Back up, back up.  Go!  PROBST: Coach and Stephen heading out now.
 Whoo!  Just put it in there!  PROBST: Erinn and J.T. back out on the course for the
Red team. Two boards left. Careful, Taj. Snap your neck.
 I know. I couldn't get it any other way.  Got it?  Yeah.
 Yeah?  PROBST: Red team's now in the lead with their third board.  Come on, Coach!
 Good.  PROBST: Debbie and Tyson looking for that fourth and final board for the Red team.
Coach and Stephen coming back now with the third board for the Black team.  Okay, that's it.
 PROBST: Taj and Sierra now out on the course looking for that fourth and final board.
 PROBST: Tyson and Debbie have their fourth board. They're heading back. Taj and Sierra have their
fourth board. They're heading back.  Put it in, guys!  PROBST: Red team back with
that fourth and final board.  Come on, girls!  PROBST: Taj and Sierra struggling to get back.
Those boards are heavy.  Okay...  Upside down.  Move it? Upside down.
 PROBST: Black team, back with their final board. Now, got to start eyeballing, looking down the line at all
these pieces of puzzle board.  Nothing, Erinn.  PROBST: When you have the boards in the right position,
they will line up to reveal vowels.  There's nothing.  PROBST: You see a vowel
clearly, you have it right. If your vision is blocked, you have it wrong.  There, there-there, that was
good, good, good! Leave that one! Good! "A's" good, too!
 We've got "A..."  Good, good, good, and good. We got it, okay.  Read the letters.
 PROBST: Red team thinks they have it right. They're working on solving the puzzle.
 Flip that. Flip that and reverse it. Flip it and reverse it.  Once you have the seven
vowels, you will mix those with the seven consonants and the punctuation. Looking for a four-word phrase.
 Switch it over, the first one, right?  Take this one, flip it.  PROBST: Coach, Sierra, Taj,
and Stephen are still trying to get their boards lined up.
 Feast, feast, feast, feast.  What do you think?  I think this one's...  No, flip it around.
 PROBST: Black team taking forever to get these pieces in the right order. Red team made it look easy.
 Got it!  We got it.  PROBST: Red team thinks they have it.
"You've won a feast" is correct. Red team wins reward! Black team never even got
started.  Good job, you guys.
 PROBST: Erinn, Debbie, Tyson, J.T., nice work.  Thank you.  Thanks.
 PROBST: Before you head out for your nice reward, big decision: Taj, Sierra, Stephen, Coach.
One of the four of them going to Exile Island.  Stephen.  Stephen.
 PROBST: No question about it.  It's my home away from home, Jeff.  Do it, Steve.
Now that Brendan's gone and his idol's out of play, I feel like there's a new idol on Exile, so Stephen needs to be
on Exile to ensure that Sierra doesn't get the other idol if there is one placed out.  PROBST: Erinn, Debbie, Tyson,
J.T., grab your stuff. Head out and enjoy the afternoon. Coach, you continue to lose out
on these nice rewards. All that life experience not helping you out here.  You know, I didn't line up
boards like this in the Amazon.  PROBST: All right, guys. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
 Next time, maybe.
 Hello. (indistinct chatter) Hi. Thank you.  Thank you. Hey.
 I was super-excited to win the challenge 'cause I've never been on a reward before.  Oh, man, look at the food.
 Just to the left of us was all this food, and I'm so hungry today. This is so perfect.
I really wanted this.  Mmm!  Mmm!  Oh, my gosh!
Did you get any of this?  Mm-hmm. Yes, I did.  We look filthy. We haven't brushed our teeth in
26 days, and then we pile on as much food as we can on our plates and we're eating like savages.
And they're all looking at us like, "What's wrong with these people?"  We're very hungry.
 Very hungry.  Very, very hungry.  Normally, I usually don't eat like this.
And little children, I love little children. I'm a school principal in the United States.
That's why I was asking about the children. As a mother, you know, I miss my children horribly at home.
And as a principal, I miss all of you know, my 908 Drake Middle School kids. So immediately, I just
gravitated towards these little boys. You're beautiful. You're a very handsome man.
(laughter) Yeah. I don't think I'll ever take my job for granted anymore 'cause
I've been without it, and I've always loved it, but I realize how much I love those kids that I work with.
 Dueling banjos, okay.  That's really cool. (singing in Portuguese)
 Capoeira is a Brazilian form of martial arts, but they don't actually make any physical contact.
They look like they're fighting, but it's also a dance. and then they started pulling us up and teaching us how to do
the dance along with them. (cheering)
 After we had eaten all that food, you're so stuffed you can't move, and then we've got these people that are like,
"No, come, come, dance with us." I'm like, "Okay, do a little dance. Fine, no big deal."
But once I sat down again, oh, man, it was terrible. I way overdid it. Gross, I just threw up on my
feet. I was like the little kid that eats pizza and ice cream and, like, gets in, like, the
playland balls and jumps around a bunch, and then can't understand why they threw up. It was terrible.
 Brendan left with the idol in his pocket last night, and it could just be that there's a second idol out there and
nobody knows where it is.
So I am hoping to find a clue to a new idol. And I would end up with two idols in my possession,
This looks like a big piece of paper. Which could it might mean? Oh, no.
It's clue #7, which means there's no new idol, which means I'm here for nothing. Oh, well.
I'm lucky I'm not on that reward. Who wants to be feasting when they could be... in sand?
Thank God I have no food and bleak surroundings for a couple of days, you know?
(cawing)
 You and... and Coach and Tyson had an alliance? Does that make you bad people?  No, but if we would have
messed up and, and gotten the wrong thing in the game, then I expect to just... "Yeah, I did wrong. I'm sorry."
 I didn't know.  Who do you think needs to go then? Everybody else has been loyal.
Who goes, if not you? There's reactions to actions. You chose the wrong action, and, I mean, I love you to death.
I care about you. I don't like to have to vote you off.  You think what just happened
to you guys was a huge deal? You have no flippin' clue how many people are going to do that to you guys.
Later down the road, there will be a moment where you will regret this.  Prob... okay, maybe.
But I have got an alliance now, and you've got to understand, I've got to play the game, too, Sierra.
 Now I'm in limbo. That puts me even more in an insecure position.  Okay.
 That's the choice you made.  Like I says, it's not against you personally... Oh, now, you get to decide?
You wanted to talk to me, now you want to decide when it's over?  I wanted to talk to you in a
nonconfrontational level where people weren't interjecting.  Okay, so you're done with me?  I'm done with fighting.
I'm done with everyone. (crying): You know, I'm getting kicked in the face.  No one's kicking you in the
face. Why do you think that?  Because it's just ironic...  Because we're not saying what
you want to hear.  ...how you're going to keep around other liars. There's other...?
 Who's the other liars?  I'm not talking to you, Erinn.  I'm just asking who you're
talking about. If there's liars amongst us, I'd like to know who they are.  Well, you'd be the last
person that I'd tell.  Oh, so it's like that? Well, I mean, we're just all kind of like... you're saying
the same thing over and over and over again. And, like, I think we're just done hearing it.
 Okay. As much as Sierra just annoys me to death, and I think that she's so dumb, she's right.
Everything she said is totally true. Once Sierra's no longer with us, the game will change.
And I am the one that's going to, like, turn all of this on its head. Guilty as charged.
 Hey, Coach. All I wanted to say was, if you were me, would you just roll over and take it?
I mean, yeah, I could just roll over and accept it, but then I guess I wouldn't be me, and I guess you wouldn't expect me to
do something like that 'cause you'd probably expect more out of me. I was never going to go hurt
anyone that I really cared about, and...  Except for me.  But if... if given, like...
I mean, I'm not asking for one, but I'm saying if it sounds practical, if it even sounds possible, given another chance,
I would prove I am a good person. I am a loyal person. But if I gave up on myself
right now, like I want to, I just want to go home, I do. I don't want to be around a whole bunch of people that...
that I hurt. But I don't want to go out like that.  But I mean, if you're asking
me would I like to give you a second chance? Of course I'd like to give you a second chance.
Am I going to you a second chance? Probably not. This is what I think.
The honorable thing is to accept your fate, not try to make deals with people. And the samurai warrior, if he
did dishonor to himself or his family, you know what he would do? He would fall on his sword.
Death before dishonor. You can't change the inevitable.  You really want to see Erinn stay here over me?
 No, but you made your bed.  Would I be Strong Sierra if I didn't have this conversation with you?
No. Would you be Coach, the one who pushed up against me to make me work harder at challenges if
you didn't think that I had that in me? No. So don't get mad at me for
having this conversation with you.  You know, the coach in me is continually looking to those
that are in need of assistance or encouragement. So I see somebody like Sierra, my heart just goes out to her.
 How do you save the kind enemy?  That kills me to have this kid here asking me to throw her
a bone because she's going through so much trials. It breaks my heart.  Would you give up, Coach, if
you made the wrong choice? There is a very, very small glimmer of hope, but I most definitely need to win immunity.
I feel it's my only chance of pulling through this.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Stephen, returning from Exile Island.  Stephen!
 Hello. Oh, I missed you guys. I miss body warmth is what I missed.
 Get in here. We missed you.  PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
 Yes!  PROBST: First things first, Tyson, take back the necklace. Tyson has had this both times
it's been up for grabs. Will he get it a third time? For today's challenge, you're going to take part in the
Survivor  version of shuffleboard. You'll each have three pucks. You'll slide your pucks across
the board with one simple goal: the person whose puck ends up closest to the center of the "X" wins immunity, and guaranteed
a one-in-seven shot at winning the million dollars. Losers goes to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted
out of this game. There is a twist to today's challenge. If you feel so confident that
you don't think you need immunity, you can skip participating in the challenge and instead...
 Oh, no...  PROBST: ...you can eat. (jubilant shouting)  PROBST: You're each going to
get a rock. Take a rock.  Oh, my God, thank you!  PROBST: There's no looking.
The rock doesn't mean anything at this point. If you want to eat, you're going to show me that rock.
If you want to play, you're going to show me an empty hand. Everybody put your hands out. And reveal.
Stephen says he's going to eat. J.T. says he's going to eat. Coach says he's going to eat.
 So Coach is hungry enough to quit a game and eat pizza. When do I get my pizza, dude? I've been winning all these
challenges, you know? They should let me have pizza and not worry about sealing the deal to get rid of Sierra.
 PROBST: Those of you eating, take a spot at the table. Everybody else, we will draw for our order and we'll get
started.
All right, we have our order. This challenge is set to begin. J.T., Steve, and Coach, you guys can eat for as long as the
challenge goes. Start eating. Sierra, you're first up. Everybody will have three shots
and we will rotate the order every round so that nobody is ever stuck in the same position. Sierra, a little short.
 Hmm.  PROBST: Debbie now up with her first shot. Debbie, a little short.
There's a learning curve to this. (grunting) Use that cold energy and that
shiver. Taj goes a little long. Erinn with her first shot. Nobody having much luck yet.
All Tyson does is block the road for everybody else. Second round: this time, Debbie, you will go first.
 Oh.  PROBST: First round didn't yield much. Debbie with a nice shot.
 Whoo!  Come on, Debbie.  PROBST: Debbie is now the closest.
Taj with her second shot. Tyson gets a bump from Taj. Tyson is now the mark to beat. Erinn is up.
Erinn slides inside of Tyson. Erinn is now the closest. Tyson now with his second shot.  Good job, Erinn.
 PROBST: Tyson, once again, blocks the road. Sierra now with her second shot. She's going to have to get past
Tyson to get a shot at it. Sierra moves Tyson into the lead. After two rounds, Tyson is the
closest to the "X." Everybody has one shot left. Taj will be first up.  I can't focus.
Oh!  PROBST: Taj, nothing but a sand dune.  Oh, I should have ate.
 PROBST: Erinn's now up. Erinn knocks out Sierra's closest puck. Tyson now up.
Tyson, your last shot. Tyson increases his lead.  Tyson!  PROBST: Tyson still the mark
to beat. Sierra is up. Sierra, you know what you need to do.
You need to get closer to that "X" than Tyson. Sierra knocks Tyson out and puts herself in position to win
this challenge. Sierra is now the mark to beat. Huge move.  When Sierra was doing her
little dance, I was just like, "I might have screwed everything up." Should I have been out there
competing? Yeah, I should have been.  PROBST: Debbie is now up with her last shot.
 Oh, Lord.  PROBST: This is it. It comes down to this. Sierra will walk away with
immunity unless Debbie can land closer to that "X." And she does.  Debbie!
 PROBST: Debbie wins individual immunity. (cheering) This challenge is over.
Drop it, Stephen. Finish what's in your mouth. That's it. Debbie, come on over.
 Oh, yeah!  Debbie!  PROBST: Middle school principal has a one-in-seven
shot of winning this game. Debbie cannot be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, after
27 days, one of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. I'll see you at Tribal Council.
Congratulations.  Thank you.  What I needed to do today was win that immunity challenge,
and it didn't happen. So a part of me is like, "Maybe that's my fate." But there's a large part of me
that prays for a miracle.
 Debbie, if I would've known you were going to win, I would have sat down and eaten half a slice.
 I know.
 I'm excited. I wanted to win one immunity, at least.  And there's nothing awesomer
than seeing somebody celebrate before the game is over.  Yeah.  I would have liked to have
the immunity necklace again. I thought it would be pretty badass if I would have worn it for a third time.
But tonight's Tribal Council is going to be awesome. Um, I'm hoping that Sierra will cry a lot.
 I do not want to go to Tribal in the rain.  Oh, God.
 Yeah.
 That's true.  I mean, this is, like the time. It's like opportunity's
knocking. What the hell are we-- you know?  I know.  See, get... talk to J.T.
Let me know what y'all want to do. I'm willing to do whatever y'all want to do.
You're a hundred percent with us, right? Okay, okay.  Tyson is such a physical
competitor, that he may win every challenge out here. We got lucky today and someone else won, so we have to get rid
of Tyson. Um, and this might just be the chance to do it. It could be Tyson or Sierra
tonight. This is not an easy decision. But I know that there's no way I can win this game by just
kind of hanging out and letting other people make my decisions. This move is potentially a very pivotal one.
 I wouldn't worry.  I'd hate to make it this early 'cause we don't want to get stuck with Sierra.
 You know it happens. It happens every season. Someone goes on a run. Let's make it you.
 It'd be a lot safer, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  No.
Sierra is.  Sierra is a lying bitch and I hate her.  I hate her, too.
 I want to get her away from my face, dude. If we stick through with this plan that we're talking about
now-- Stephen, myself, Erinn, and Taj. If we get rid of Tyson, we could do it without talking to Sierra
'cause we have the numbers, but it's going to go against the warrior alliance that Coach has worked so hard to build here.
So it's going to be a tough decision.  We going to recap the plan.  Okay.
 Sierra's going tonight, no-brainer.  Okay.  One of my top priorities
right now at this point is to go to the five with the warrior alliance. It would be ... stupid if we
made an alliance, gave it a name, bandied the name about, talked about ourselves being warriors, and then chickened out
at the last second. I know I can trust you and that's so important to me, man.  You have my word.
 There you go.  It's really going to crush Coach if I go through with this move to get rid of Tyson.
It's really going to crush him. I don't know what I'm going to do, man.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
Brendan, voted out at the last Tribal Council.
At the last Tribal Council, Brendan was blindsided. Sierra, you looked stunned.  Uh, yeah, and, unfortunately,
I'll probably go home due to the choices that I made, but if it's my time, it's my time, and, uh, no one here is blindsiding me
today.  PROBST: Tyson, in spite of not having immunity tonight, concerned it could be you, or
are you feeling pretty comfortable tonight?  Yeah, I'm feeling pretty comfortable.
The people I've aligned myself with are the people I trust. I'm also happy that Debbie won. When you can't win yourself,
it's nice to see someone you love win.  Thank you, Tyson.  PROBST: J.T., a little hard
to hear that? Tyson saying, "Well, if I can't win, I'm glad Debbie won." He didn't say, "I'm glad..."
 Well, I said "someone I love." It's not to say she's the only one I love here.
 PROBST: Who else do you love here?  Um, Debbie, Coach, Stephen, Taj, Erinn, J.T., Brendan.
 PROBST: So your vote's pretty clear. You're voting Sierra.  Yes.
 PROBST: Sierra, do you think people are telling you you're going to be voted out because they want to appear nice, so
that when you're on the jury, you'll consider voting for them if they make it to the end?  No, it was kind of obvious
the moment that Brendan went out that I was next. What I was trying to tell them was that in the alliance that I
made with someone else, I probably spoke to that person about what we were planning on doing...
 PROBST: I don't know what you're talking about.  What do you mean?  Nobody does.
 Tyson!  I know what she's saying. You want me to explain it?  No, I don't need you to
explain it for me, Tyson. What I'm explaining is...  PROBST: What's going on between you and Tyson?
 Tyson always likes to badger me, and that's the way that Tyson is. He's kind of a smartass.
I don't think half the things he has to say are very funny. But he's never been really nice to me and that's fine.
 PROBST: Tyson, is that true? Have you and Sierra butted heads from the beginning?  I've never really felt a
close bond with Sierra. I mean, tried to be friendly and cordial, but when I'm done listening to her talk, I'm done
listening.  PROBST: Are you concerned at all that that kind of an attitude could cost in this
game?  I told her I'd give her five minutes and I did. And she kept going.
And, I mean, I was irritated at what her and Brendan had tried to do. So I don't know why I need
to give her all the courtesy and she give me none.  Um, well, this is a game about strengths and weaknesses.
It's not a personality contest. The thing is, he's really strong in challenges, and if you want to take someone strong all the
way to the final two, like, so be it. But he is really strong. I wouldn't be voting him out
because we didn't get along as two people. I'd be voting him out so that I could win a reward challenge or
so that someone else that I aligned with could win another challenge. It's just the way that the game
works.  Coach, Sierra brings up a good point. Tyson won the first two
immunity challenges. He doesn't have immunity tonight. Is he a threat?
And if so, why not take him out tonight?  I've said from the very beginning that I wanted to walk
the path of the noble warrior and finding that great competition that you can pit yourself against.
 PROBST: And then you voted out Brendan.  Yeah.  I will explain this to you.
 PROBST: I'm sure you will.  Because Brendan pitted himself against me. If it's war, one-on-one...
 PROBST: I thought that's what you wanted?  Exactly, and I won. Thank you.
Exactly. I outsmarted him. I outfoxed him, and at the moment, sorry to say, I'm
outleading him.  PROBST: Okay.  So I won that battle. Now, as far as the other people,
if I'm going to have trust in this tribe, we are going to be on the same page. And we are going to battle each
other in an honorable fashion. If I give them my word, I'm not going to go back on that.  PROBST: So an honorable
battle to you then means as long as we both agree on how we're going to play this, I'll battle you.
 Absolutely. I will be a ravenous wolf for anybody that wants to go head-to-head with me, and I will
cut them off at the knees with no remorse and no regret.  PROBST: J.T., what do you make of having the best "battle
it out to the end"?  Coach said he was going to change the game. He's definitely changing it.
I've never seen anyone take the best competitors to the end. When he gives me his word, I take it to the bank.
There's no doubt about it.  PROBST: Coach, if J.T. gives you his word, do you take it to the bank?
 The first time I looked in J.T.'s eyes and I shook his hand, I knew that where he comes from, that meant something.
And I see honesty and trust. And I see a warrior in battle. That's somebody, obviously, that I respect and I believe a
hundred percent when he tells me something.  PROBST: Okay, it is time to get to the vote.
Debbie, you have immunity. You can give that up to somebody else or keep it for yourself.
 I think I'll wear it proudly tonight.  PROBST: You cannot vote for Debbie.
Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Tyson, you're up.
 Last week, Sierra, I slayed the dragon. This week I had to take care of his bride.
Good night, sweet princess.
 You're a jerk.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Sierra.
Tyson. Sierra. Two votes Sierra; one vote Tyson.
Sierra. Three votes Sierra; one vote Tyson. Tyson.
Three votes Sierra; two votes Tyson. Tyson. We're tied.
That's three votes Sierra; three votes Tyson.
Tyson. That's four votes Tyson; three votes Sierra. One vote left.
Ninth person voted out and the second member of our jury: Tyson. You need to bring me your torch.
Tyson, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.
Another Tribal Council, another blindside. This is shaping up to be a battle to the end.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by

 PROBST: Next time on Survivor:  We're taking out all our people, and you and I are
sitting ducks.  PROBST: Timbira tries to regroup.  It would be you, me, Sierra,
and Erinn?  Coach, I think that's the only way.  PROBST: But find themselves
at Sierra's mercy.  I thought you said you were going to be loyal?  Then you wrote my name down
last night.  I'm going to ask you this again, Sierra: where's your loyalty right now?
 Sneaky bastards. Now I know how Brendan feels. Yeah, it was a big shock. I thought I had my game in the
bag, but I should've probably not been quite as confident or so, uh, gullible. Good luck to everybody.
I guess everybody deserves to be there. You beat me. That's a huge accomplishment.
That bothers me that Sierra will be here longer than me. A little weird being outfoxed by an idiot, but I'm not crying
over it.
