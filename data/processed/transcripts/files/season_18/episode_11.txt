 JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor:  I want you to think about the alliance with Stephen and J.T.
I have the power alliance. Commanding my officers like I was born to do-- hence my name, the Dragonslayer.
Sierra's going tonight, no-brainer.  You're gonna be the next to go.
You're not gonna be able to change that.  Given another chance, I would prove I  am  a loyal person.
 Am I gonna give you a second chance? Probably not.  There's a large part of me
that prays for a miracle.  PROBST: Ninth person voted out and the second member of our jury:
Tyson. Another Tribal Council, another blindside. This is shaping up to be a
battle to the end. Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 You rock, Sierra. That was a big one.  I thought I was going home. I totally thought I was going
home. It's crazy. I couldn't have asked for a better Tribal.
 Coach, I don't want you or Debbie to feel like you were out of the loop. I knew you would not want to go
against your word with Tyson.  Right.  The reason that we didn't tell Debbie and Coach that we
were gonna vote out Tyson is 'cause we didn't want them scrambling and changing their plan.
We knew what their votes were gonna be. We could safely get rid of Tyson without telling them.
 It was a good move, guys. And I'm glad... I appreciate you not telling me.  Bold and brilliant tonight,
guys. I mean, I've got really good intuition, you know...  Yeah.
 ...and I didn't see it coming.  Yeah, but I don't want you to be mad at me, Coach.
 I'm not in the least. I appreciate you guys not telling me.  Both Coach and Debbie
realized that the dynamics of the tribe had suddenly, dramatically shifted, and they were trying to curry favor with
us. So basically anything we had done was the greatest thing that had ever been accomplished.
You know, "What a tremendous blindside." It worried me a little bit because I would rather have an
honest blowout than have people smiling saccharine smiles at me and, you know, plotting something else.
 Absolutely no hard feelings.  Thanks, Coach.  Okay? I mean it. I mean it. ♪ ♪

♪ ♪  Yeah, okay. I love you two to death, and I'll be honest: I trust you
completely.
 Where I am in this game right now is, I'm recoiling to figure out exactly what my next move is.
Kind of like a snake. Stephen, J.T., and I talked about all of us being there towards the end, but do you
believe them? That's the question of the day.
It's dangerous with Stephen and Taj and J.T. together, and if we take out Sierra, and then Erinn next, they have everything
in line with what they need. Then they can take me out and then you out. I would have bet my life that
Tyson was still gonna be here today. There is not any downtime. You've got to work your people.
Every move is critical now, and the next two people supposedly that are on the chopping block are Erinn and
Sierra. That takes Timbira down to two immediately. Now where do we go?
I am not gonna be happy going out fifth. And I'm not gonna be happy you going out fourth.
You and me, Sierra, and Erinn?  Otherwise, we're taking out all our people, and then you and I are sitting ducks, with no
leverage. If we could pull all of the Timbira tribe members back together, and get Sierra, Erinn,
Coach, and myself, we would outnumber Jalapao-- Taj, Stephen and J.T.-- and maybe be able to gain control of this game again.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?  OTHERS: Yep. Yes.
 PROBST: Today we're gonna see how in tune you are with the rest of the tribe. I have a series of questions.
You're each gonna answer these questions in private. I will then tally the results, and then I'll explain the
challenge. Take an answer board and a pen, find a private spot.  Thank you, sir.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: All right, I have tallied the results. You're now going to guess what the group said.
Whose name came up the most often? This may differ from what you've said individually.
We are looking now for the consensus. Each time you get one right, you get to make one chop on another
tribe member's rope. When your rope has been chopped three times...  Oh!
 PROBST: ...you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins reward.
Want to know what you're playing for?  OTHERS: Yeah. Yes.  PROBST: The winner of today's
challenge will be taken to the fervadora, which is a natural spring unlike anything you've experienced before.
You will understand what I mean when you get there. You'll also join a local family for a home-cooked, traditional
Brazilian feast.  Oh...  PROBST: The winner will also send one person to Exile Island.
A lot at stake? Worth playing for?  OTHERS: Yeah. Yes.  PROBST: Go ahead and pick up
your boards. Here we go, first question. "Who has not lived up to their potential?"
Remember, you are guessing who you think got the most votes. Everybody reveal. A lot of votes for Coach,
couple of votes for Sierra. The person whose name came up the most often to this question was...
Coach. Debbie got it right. Erinn got it right. Sierra got it right.
Coach  got it right, and Taj got it right. All right, Erinn, you're up first.
Take your shot. First blood. So many choices.
 Erinn!  PROBST: Sierra with the first hit on her rope. Two more, and she is out.
Debbie, you're up.
 What?!  PROBST: J.T. takes a hit. He's got two left before he's out of this challenge.
Taj, you're up.  Little Debbie, it's not personal. I just want to eat.
 It's okay. I still love you, Taj.  I love you, too.  PROBST: Coach, the man who
has not lived up to his potential, now gets to take a whack at somebody.  Oh, wow.
 PROBST: Coach whacks Sierra. Sierra takes her second hit in this first round. Sierra.
 I was already going for you, Coach.  Oh...  PROBST: Coach takes his first
hit. All right, end of round one. Sierra, the only person down to her last hit.
Next question: "Who would squander the million dollars the quickest?" Who would waste this money
faster than anybody else? Everybody reveal. A lot of names came up. The correct answer...
Sierra. J.T. got it right. Debbie got it right. Erinn got it right.
All right, Debbie, you're up. Erinn takes her first hit.  Sorry, Erinn.  PROBST: J.T., you're up.
 Oh, J.T.!  PROBST: And with that, Sierra is out of the challenge.  Everyone hacked my rope
first. I think that a lot of people are being hard on me because I think a lot of people still want
me to go home. And yeah, it hurts.  PROBST: Erinn, you're up. Debbie takes her second hit.
She's down to just one hit left on her rope. Next question: "Who would never survive on their own?"
Everybody reveal. J.T. and Coach said Sierra. Everybody else said Debbie, including  Debbie.
 I would have no one to talk to, Jeff.  PROBST: The correct answer is... Debbie.
Stephen got it right. Debbie got it right. Erinn it right, and Taj got it right.
Taj, you're up. Coach takes his second hit. Erinn. Coach is out of the challenge.
Take a spot on the bench next to Sierra. Stephen.  Sorry.
 It's okay, babe.  PROBST: Debbie, you're out of this challenge, but Debbie got it right, so, Debbie, take your
last licks.  Sorry, Erinn.  It's okay.  PROBST: Erinn takes her
second hit, and with that, Debbie will take a spot on the bench, joining Sierra and Coach. We are now down to four.
Taj and Stephen with all three hits left on their rope, J.T. with two left, Erinn with only one hit left.
Next question: "Who would you trust with your life?"  Oh.  This is a gimme.
 PROBST: Everybody reveal.  This is a gimme, my friend.  PROBST: Everybody says J.T. Correct answer is J.T.
Everybody got it right.  I don't know why everyone trusts me so much, but in this game I'm not so trustworthy.
And it seems like people would catch on to that. It may be the accent or something, I don't know.
 PROBST: Taj, you're up first.  Raah!  PROBST: J.T. takes his second hit.
All right, J.T., you're up.  Erinn, I'm sorry, baby.  Oh!  PROBST: J.T. takes Erinn out
of this challenge, but Erinn got it right, so Erinn gets one last whack. That retaliation knocks J.T.
out of the challenge. Erinn takes a spot on the bench. We are now down to two people left in this challenge.
Stephen, you're up. Wow. Some force behind that.  Get your butt over here.  It's on.
 PROBST: Taj now down to two hits left on her rope. Steven has all three hits left on his rope.
Next question. Who is most likely to stab you in the back?  Mmm.
 PROBST: That is not an easy question to answer. Reveal. Correct answer is... Sierra.
 Wow.  PROBST: Taj, you're up. (grunting)  No!
 PROBST: Stephen takes his first hit. Stephen, take your hit. (Taj gasps)
 I feel it in my chest, Stephen. Taj now down to one hit left on her rope.
If Stephen gets this right, he wins reward. Who would you least like to see win this game?
 God.
 Okay.  PROBST: Reveal. Stephen said Sierra. Taj said Coach.
One of you got it right. One of you got it wrong.  Oh, I hate that.  The correct answer was not
Coach. The correct answer is Sierra. Stephen wins this challenge. Stephen, take your last chop.
And with this, Stephen wins reward.  Yay, Steve-o!  Good job, Stephen!
 PROBST: All right. Before we get to the reward, a not-so-pleasant task.  I don't want to do this.
 PROBST: Who are you going to send to Exile Island? Not only will they not be a part of the reward, they're not going
back to camp. They're going by themselves to Exile, which is no fun at all. Erinn, I'm really sorry.
 Okay.  PROBST: Erinn, Exile Island again. Erinn does not look happy.
 I decided that Erinn should go to Exile because my alliance of J.T., Taj, and Erinn wants to keep Exile under wraps.
We want the four of us to be the only ones on Exile Island, just in case a new idol pops up.  PROBST: All right, Stephen.
Choose one person to join you on this reward.  It's got to be Taj.
 PROBST: Taj going to be joining Stephen. You guys are going to the fervadora.
You'll have some nice food, get away from camp. One more person can come with you.
 Stephen.  I made a promise to Jet that I would take him, so I've got to take him.
 PROBST: J.T. going on reward with Taj and Stephen.  You're a reward hog.  PROBST: All right.
Debbie, Sierra, Coach, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
Stephen, J.T., and Taj, grab your stuff. Head out. Have a good time.
 Okay.  Good old Stephen won the reward challenge today and then he picked Taj and J.T., part of
his original tribe, so now, I'm afraid that when push comes to shove, that Stephen and J.T. will stick with Taj, and I'm at
their mercy.  Stephen, myself, and Taj arrive at reward at a Brazilian farm.
 Hola.  Hola.  Hey, man.  Hey.
 We were greeted by a father and son and taken inside their kitchen. (kids singing)
 Hola.  Come sit.  Have a seat.  Oh, my.
 That looks delicious.  Oh, wow. Very quickly, dishes started getting piled up on the table.
There was a stew with some kind of meat in it. There were eggs that were the freshest eggs I might have had
in my life. There was vegetables, you know, carrots and beets. These were all native dishes of
the region, and it turns out the local cuisine is pretty amazing.  Mmm.  Very good.
Thank you. (thuds)
 Oh, no. (crying) The little three-year-old-- she fell off the table and hit
her head. I just went into mommy mode. I ran over to her; I picked her up, and I'm like, "Oh, it's
going to be okay." I had to control my emotions because looking at her, I saw my son.
When they told me she was three years old, I'm like, "This is my baby. This is my baby."
And I missed him so much at that point, so when I picked her up, I just held her tight and I just imagined her being him.
But she definitely made me realize how much I miss my family, and I will never go away this long ever again,
ever, ever, ever.  After the meal was over, a couple of the kids escorted us down to the fervadora, which
was this local spring.  Come on, Steve-o! It smells kind of weird. Whoa!
I could see the sand, but there's no bottom. Apparently, the water spring is pushing the sand up, but my feet
didn't touch anything. I was just kind of like a cork. I was just kind of bobbing there, being pushed up by water.
(laughing)
 Whoa! It's pushing my feet out of the water...  That's so cool.
(laughing)  Let's have a power talk now.  I mean, our next move is obviously Sierra, right?
 Uh-huh.  Because Coach is really secure around all of us.  I think so, you know...
Sierra's a strong physical competitor, you know? The only reason not to do Sierra is that she could be on our side
long enough to take out Debbie. Debbie is shrewd. Let's not discount Debbie as a real strategic player.
Sierra's a much more erratic player than Debbie. I would rather play with someone whose motivations I can guess,
but right now is a good opportunity to get rid of Debbie, so it's something that the four of us can seriously
consider. And, you know, I don't know what Erinn feel about Debbie.  Erinn's with us.
She just feels like none of them care about her, so why should she care about them?  Right.
 As soon as I got here, I checked the urn and big surprise, a new clue to the same spot where the idol isn't.
We have checked and checked and checked tree mail and there isn't one there, so obviously, the idol is gone.
(thunder rumbles) Help me, please. It's hard to be out here when the rest of my alliance is out
on a reward. I could not get a fire started before it started to rain and that killed me.
I had no food, no water, no warmth, no way to dry anything, and I slept in constant pouring rain.
This is the kind of thing that I think could break a person down. Like, I really didn't think I
was tough enough to do this part of it. I am about as girly and prissy as they come.
So, in my own personal tally of things that I've done in my life that I never thought I would overcome, this is going to
be at the top of the list.
 She may be mad enough now that they've sent her to Exile. Sierra, you would go with whatever Coach decided, wouldn't
you?  I don't know right now.  Okay.  I thought you said you were
going to be loyal.  Then you wrote my name down last night and you didn't save me like I asked you to and they
did.  So, that's how it's going to be? You're next then, baby.
So, I'm going to ask you this again, Sierra.  I don't have an answer.  No, I'm asking you this right
now. Where's your loyalty right now? If it's not with Deb and I...  I said I don't have an...
Right now, I'm standing on my own.  Well, Coach and I know where we are and so...
 You guys are in some big trouble right now. You guys have two people.  Who?
 You two.  You don't know who we have. You have no idea who we have.  Okay, so it's J.T., Stephen,
Taj. They're connected. They're not going anywhere, okay?
Erinn voted for Tyson last time without telling you guys.  Sierra, you don't need to put threats in our head that we're
in trouble.  I'm not giving you threats. I'm giving you the facts.  Fine!
The facts in your brain. We have all lived a life of hell for 28 days and I'm not doing it with you today.
So I'm done. I'm done.  They... he asked me.  I'm done talking about it,
Sierra, with you.  I didn't even bring it up.  It is over with me today. Period.
 Coach and Debbie came to me and they were like, "We need to get our alliance back," and I was like, "Last night, you guys
voted for me." Like, "What makes you think I'm just going to jump right back in?"
And they freaked out. Jalapao's brilliant. They used me to get to Tyson. So, someone's playing their game
right and I think I'd rather go with the smart people.
 I know. I can't believe that she, uh... is that stupid.  J.T. said to me, "It's you,
me, Stephen, and Coach in the end."  And do you trust him to say that?
 I don't know.  You just let me work on J.T. If he wants him and Stephen and you and I to be in the final
four, we have nothing to worry about. A line was drawn in the sand today.
Sierra has no loyalty in this game and the old Timbira tribe is not going to get back together, so I need to get a
concrete answer from J.T. on who he wants to be in the final four and then I'll make my move.
 This conversation has to be between you and I. I'm laying all my cards out.  All right.
 So, my question to you is this. Are you cool with Sierra going next?
 Yeah.  Then Erinn?  Yeah.  Then Taj?
 Yeah, okay.  And that leaves, you, me, Stephen, and Debbie.  I think that's the way to go.
 This morning, I had all these things churning in my mind from the other day. I'm worried about how J.T. and
Stephen blindsided Tyson, so I really wanted to talk to J.T. So that just reconfirmed the next vote, Sierra will be the
one to go. Sierra said something about, "Let's talk about getting Timbira back."
And I said, "That's not going to happen." I don't want to get in bed with a snake.
She's going to do whatever it takes to get her farthest in the game without any honor. I don't trust Sierra, and the
sooner she's gone, I think, the better. J.T. was very receptive, and I trust J.T., so all in all,
a very good day's work.
And I'm like, I'm gonna play like, for me right now, and they both went bananas.  So, Coach approached you, you
wanna...  They both came back. They both came back and...  They were freaking out.
 Yeah.  Sierra came to me and said that both Coach and Debbie explored the possibility of a
renewed Timbira alliance. And my immediate thought was complete panic. I am very scared of a Timbira
resurgence. Ultimately, we know that we're gonna have to betray Debbie and Coach, and to do that, we need
them on our side. I would like to include you, you know, but like, you could be playing me right now.
 Okay. Like, look at me. I don't want to play any more games.
I'm, honestly, at this point right now, the least of anyone to worry.  All right.
Let's, let's head back so they don't think we're talking too much strategy.
 There's the man! Stephen, I love you, man. Come have a seat. Stephen, no, but...
 I was thinking, like, Debbie and Coach are gonna think, like, well, there goes the Jalapao members, you know, BFF forever.
I mean, I figured you guys would come back and be like, "We need to take those guys out."  And you know what?
Of course that's what everybody talked about, but it didn't come out of my mouth. As soon as we got back here,
Debbie and Sierra said, "Do you guys wanna talk about, you know, the alliance and everything like that?"
And I thought about it for like 15 seconds, then I said, "I cannot do that to those guys." There's gonna be no Timbira
alliance. I don't like it; it makes me sick to my stomach to think about it.
 Sierra on board with the new Timbira alliance?  Sierra's on board for whatever she can do, but, you
know, she's just a half-wit floating on the breeze, not really knowing where she's going.
 According to Sierra, Coach and Debbie are plotting against me and J.T., and Coach is saying that Sierra can't be trusted
right now. So, I can't get a real sense of who is telling the truth, which makes me suspicious of the
three of them. Sierra told me that Coach and Debbie said, "This is our only chance.
We got the numbers now."
 ...getting the old Timbira back together.  I just, I don't know, man. I don't know.
 There's a lot of stories being told, a lot of paranoia setting in. I don't know what's going on.
I've got a lot to think about now.
 Well, he may just be like one pathological liar.  If he lies to me, all bets are off.
 That's what I'm saying.  I think she's loyal to us.  I know.  Eventually.
Me too.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! I'll now bring in Erinn, returning from Exile Island.  Love ya, Erinn!
Oh, I'm so sorry.  You okay?  Yeah, yeah.  Here's a sweater.
Put it on.  Oh, my God, that's awesome!  PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
 Yeah.  PROBST: All right, Debbie, first things first. Give up the necklace.
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each toss a grappling hook
attempting to retrieve a bag. The first three people to retrieve all three bags move on to the final round.
For the final round, you must navigate a ball through a table maze. The ball falls in a hole, start
over. First person to get their ball into the finish net wins immunity, guaranteed a
one-in-six shot at winning this game and the million dollars that goes with it. Make sense?
We'll get started. All right, first three to get all three bags move on to the final round.
Survivors ready? Go! Coach misses his bag. Sierra just misses hers.
Debbie with a nice toss. That one might work if she can get it over. Just misses.
J.T. snags his first bag.  Ooh!  PROBST: Taj now with her first bag.
 Debbie and her first bag!  PROBST: Debbie with her first bag! (chuckles)
Stephen has one bag. Coach snags his first bag. Sierra's now on the board. Erinn, the only person without a
bag yet.  I haven't eaten in three days!  PROBST: Coach now with his
second bag.
J.T. with a good toss. Can he turn that into a snag? Gonna have to get far left... and he does!
J.T. now with his second bag. He and Coach are neck and neck. Coach and J.T. each need one more bag to move on.
Coach has his final bag! J.T. has his final bag! Coach and J.T. moving on to the next round.
Erinn has her first bag. Everybody even with one bag each. There is one spot left.
Debbie with a nice toss. Debbie snags her second bag. Debbie needs one bag. Everybody else needs two bags.
 Oh!  Ah! Come on!  PROBST: Sierra with a nice
toss. Just misses.  (chuckles): I got a knot.
 PROBST: Sierra struggling with this challenge. Stephen with a nice toss. He's got his second bag.
Debbie and Stephen each have one more bag to go. Stephen with a nice toss. Can he turn this into a snag?
(Debbie screaming)  PROBST: Debbie nails it! First one to get their bag across the line moves on.
 No!  PROBST: Debbie, Coach, J.T., moving on to the final round!  This is gonna be fun.
 PROBST: All right, final round. J.T., Coach, Debbie, survivors ready?
Go. Very simple task. Get the ball from the start to the finish.
First person to finish wins immunity.
J.T. off to a quick start. Coach right behind him.
J.T.'s gotta start again. Coach now with a decent-sized lead. Coach being very cautious.
Debbie going backwards.
 Jeff!  PROBST: That is my fault, I know. That cautious approach starting
to pay off for Coach. J.T.'s starting to come on strong now.
Debbie right in there. Debbie starting over again. J.T. right around the corner from Coach now.
J.T. taking a little risk. And with a big move, J.T. catches Coach.
J.T. with another nice move, passes Coach.
 Oh!  You better believe it, baby! Dragonslayer!  PROBST: Coach wins immunity!
 Good job!  Good job, Coach.  PROBST: Coach, come on over. You're on the board.
 Yeah, finally.  PROBST: Coach is safe tonight at Tribal Council after 30 days out here.
One of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
Congratulations.  Thank you. Thank you.  It sucked to watch Coach win today.
At this point, it's probably Debbie or me going home. So, I'm gonna do everything I can to get them to go after
Debbie.
 That was a good win today. I was proud for you. I was proud for you. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.  You know, the mental concentration.  Yeah.
 This is the first immunity challenge that I have won. I feel like it kind of justifies my place here.
The meditation, the prayer, the focusing technique, I was able to lock it in and win immunity. With J.T., Stephen, and Debbie,
I'm very secure in my place in the game, but it is a good safety blanket to have.
 If you guys are in alliance with Coach and Debbie, you need to know that they tried to form an alliance with me to try to
get the numbers back to get rid of all y'all.  He told me you tried to get it back together, and he wasn't
gonna do it.  They came to me.  All I have is your word that he done that.
 Well, I swear on the Holy Bible that I'm the one who's telling the truth.
Coach? I'm gonna let my dirty laundry out because, you know, I'm gonna go out with a big bang if
you guys are gonna vote me out tonight. Do you guys want to play dirty?  You're really scrambling,
aren't you?  You lied, and I want you to admit it.  I have not lied in this game,
nor will I. First of all, does everybody want to do this? Because I don't think everybody
does.
 Lay it on us. I'm... I'm just listening.  'Kay. Yesterday when we came back here, Debbie said, "Do you
guys want to talk about if there's a ex-Jalapao alignment, right? And if we should talk about an
alignment ourselves." And at that point, you got in Debbie's face; Debbie started crying; and I said, "Sierra, I
do not want a Timbira alliance," and that's it.  I didn't talk about a Timbira alliance.
You guys both came to me and asked me for an alliance.  We did not ask you for an alliance.
 I asked where you stood.  And you said, do you think Erinn will be upset enough from Exile to bring her on to four to
get the numbers back. Did you or did you guys not say that? Because I will walk out of this
game right now if you look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't say that.  Buh-bye.
 You are such a liar!  Sierra, we talked about our options in this game. When did you become this angry?
That's not the person that I know.  And you're not the person I know anymore.
 Okay, fine, fine, I'm done.
 Come on. Don't-don't... Come on.
Sierra went crazy. She's pointing at me, calling me a liar. I am a 46-year-old professional
woman, and I cannot believe I'm in a verbal combat with a 23-year-old over what I said or didn't say.
Honestly, a lot of it I don't even remember, but it wasn't gonna change the vote on her, at least in my mind.
Who knows what'll happen tonight? You never know at Tribal. It could be me.
Nothing would surprise me.
 I think Sierra just caught Coach in a lie.  Yeah.  It sounds like they actually
approached her about "Let's take out Jalapao," and she said no.
 Yeah.
We definitely have the numbers to take out Debbie. Sierra did a service to me and J.T. by exposing Coach's
half-truths and Debbie's scheming. I definitely think Debbie is a savvy game player and she wants
to win. She is willing to make devious moves. So to take her out early
might not be a bad idea.
 Right. The problem with keeping Sierra is she's causing a lot of drama around camp.
 Who knows what Sierra will say? Who knows who she'll piss off? So sending her home eliminates
one big, nutty variable. I don't know what to do.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Brendan and Tyson, voted out at the last Tribal Council.
So, J.T., only seven people left, not a lot of places to hide.  Yeah, the game's definitely
changed, Jeff. I mean, used to chitchat and have a good time. Now, I mean, I'm scared to go
fishing. I'm afraid of what's going on at camp.  PROBST: Debbie, is that true?
Are you starting to feel the pressure of only seven people left?  Oh, absolutely.
Our happy little family is not such a happy little family anymore. And honestly, all this craziness
going on is a part of this game I do not enjoy.  PROBST: Coach, has the pressure been ramped up a little
bit?  I think there's been a catalyst, so that we're definitely reassuring ourselves
with people that we trust. But I'm standing firm in what I'm gonna do in this game, and I'm not eliminating anybody
because I'm afraid that they're gonna beat me later on in the game.  PROBST: Sierra, a beautiful
eye-roll. It went all the way around.  Whoo!  PROBST: What's going on
tonight?  Uh, Coach's profound claim to being extremely honest kind of got burned and ruined when Coach
and Debbie were just asking me whether I wanted to be Timbira-strong again, but I basically told them they were
stuck up ... creek, and I wasn't gonna help them. And then, Coach decided to go to J.T. and tell him that  I  came to
him  and said these things, so I'm happy knowing I just proved someone was gonna "change the game" in an honest way wrong.
 PROBST: Coach, your jaw was so tight while Sierra was talking.  Obviously, my credibility is
being attacked by one person because there's two things that I am not, and that is a coward and a liar.
And I honestly think that in Sierra's warped mind that she thinks that she's telling the truth.
So she can try to make accusations of two things that I hold most precious: honesty, integrity, and courage.
However, I forgive Sierra because I really felt that verse come to me where Stephen says in the temple when he's being
stoned to death and his last words are: "God forgive them, for they know not what they do." I was gonna come here tonight
and say, "Sierra, I'd like to ask your apology." Instead, she made enemies of her two best friends here by
continuing to call us out in front of our tribe. Everybody up here now is sitting here saying, "What the hell's
going on?" So the catalyst that has caused our tribe to distrust each other is this girl that's
sitting in front of me, this 23-going-on-five today with her temper tantrums.  PROBST: Taj, you're loving
this.  I absolutely love it. I've been hearing it all day, and it's, like, I haven't
watched soap operas in so long, so this is really giving me a boost. (laughs)
 PROBST: Debbie, let's talk about other threats in this game. You won the last immunity
challenge. You're clearly very popular with everybody. At what point does that become
a negative?  I hope that I'm not a threat because I'm likeable, but I'm still gonna be me, and I truly
liked everybody sitting here. Like, it's gonna start getting really hard for me to go up and write any of these names down.
I don't like it.  PROBST: J.T., what's important when you consider the vote tonight?
 You've got to factor in physical threats; you got to think about social threats; and you got to start thinking about
people you want to take to the end. You've got to figure out how to get rid of the rest of the
people without making them mad.  PROBST: And yet, Stephen, you can't always vote somebody out without making them mad because
if you start telling everybody who you're voting out, you open a doorway for them to scramble.  You're absolutely right.
I mean, you absolutely have to blindside people sometimes, and you know that there will be repercussions.
You know, I'm sure Tyson doesn't feel particularly warmly for the people who voted against him, but you have to balance your own
personal feelings against your ultimate goals in the game, and it's a really difficult decision to make.
 PROBST: Okay, it's time to get to the vote. Coach, you have the immunity necklace.
As always, you can give it up to somebody else or keep it for yourself.  At this point, I think I'll
keep it for myself.  PROBST: All right, it is time to vote. Stephen, you're up.
 We've said it all. There's nothing left to say.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Sierra.
Debbie. One vote Sierra; one vote Debbie. Stephen.
One vote Sierra; one vote Debbie; one vote Stephen. Sierra.
Two votes Sierra; one vote Debbie; one vote Stephen. Debbie.
We're tied. That's two votes Sierra; two votes Debbie; one vote Stephen.
Sierra. That's three votes Sierra; two votes Debbie; one vote Stephen.
One vote left.
Tenth person voted out and the third member of our jury: Sierra. Will you bring me your torch?
Sierra, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. ♪ ♪
Well, it's clear the six of you are struggling to trust each other, and that means paranoia is just around the corner.

 PROBST: Next time on Survivor:  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Emotions run high.  Hey, babe, we miss you so much down here at the George household.
(sobbing)  PROBST: And Debbie turns on Coach.
 If Coach went next, I mean...  I started off super-sick. I had the flu, but I persevered through it, and I've done all
that I could do to stay in the game as long as I possibly could. Coach  was  lying.
I guess they have to find that out on their own. I'm just totally floored that I made it 30 days, living essentially
in a bush with nothing
