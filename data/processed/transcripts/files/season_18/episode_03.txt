 PROBST: Previously on Survivor: (cheering) The Jalapao tribe was bonding.
 Get you some, man.  Wow, so good, so good.  PROBST: While Timbira began to splinter.
 I'm telling you, it's not going to be perfect.  That's what I think.  You're taking out some
frustration.  No, you're taking out frustration.  PROBST: When Timbira lost
the immunity challenge, the Survivors discovered a new twist. Brendan, choose one member of
the winning tribe to join you at Exile Island.  Taj.  PROBST: Taj from Jalapao
and Brendan from Timbira went to Exile Island and agreed to work together, despite being on different tribes.
They shared a clue to new hidden immunity idols.  "Then tribal homelands is the thing that you seek."
 Our homeland is where we live.  PROBST: Timbira, facing Tribal Council, turned their
sights on Sierra.  Okay, got it.  PROBST: But when Candace turned on Coach...
 Oh, yeah.  PROBST: ...he retaliated.  She got on me. She's going to get on everybody.
The cancer will ruin the tribe.  PROBST: At Tribal Council, Sierra was saved and Coach got his way.
Candace, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  The last thing in the world
I wanted to do was give Candace any idea that I was voting for her. And, like, not knowing what
everybody else was doing, I was like, oh, my God. This could be the very last nail in my own coffin.
 Erinn, obviously didn't see it coming for us voting Candace. And then when she did, she's trying to, she's trying to back
out really fast. She's-she's kind of panicking.  You guys were pretty attached at the hips the
last two days.  'Cause I wasn't sure about her.  But she was turning on the
rest of us.  Yeah.  And you...  But I did know though...
 You knew that.  You knew she was turning on the rest of us, right?  But, like, it just really
wasn't a decision that I wanted to make lightly until I felt like, felt like I knew her pretty well.
And once I did, I just felt like I could not trust her for a second.  Not only did she align
herself with the wrong person-- Candace-- she's has completely insulted all of our intelligences when we came back
tonight and she said, "You know, I've just been hanging around with Candace the last couple of days because I just
wanted to see what she was up to because I didn't trust her."  We weren't not getting along. I was very cautious with her.
But I wasn't like, "Okay, we're best friends." Well, it's all over with, so that's good.
 For her to say that to us is insulting, which is why she never would have been in my alliance from the very
beginning. And she's made her bed, and she's going to have to lie in it.

(coughing)  It's like, why are we doing this again? I go, "Okay, a million dollars,
a million dollars."  Yeah. (laughter)  Getting back from Tribal
Council was a little weird.  Morning.  Hi.  How you doing?
 I think that the time that I spent with Candace in the last few days probably associated me a little bit with her more than
I would have liked. Now I have to turn girl that maybe is kind of on the outs a little bit into absolutely the
opposite of that.  Got to win this challenge today, man. We got to be absolute animals
today.  I think it's really important that we win challenges, so I have to go in
there and I have to outperform. Do I think that I can outperform Sierra and Debbie? I think so.
I'm just going to have to really, really suck it up and do it because now I feel like I'm kind of fighting for my life a
little bit.
 Unfortunately, that's all we've got for breakfast, Jerry.
Yeah, but you didn't eat dinner, either.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Well, it maybe-maybe had been
what had my, uh, stomach screwed up.  Ugh.  Yeah.
Best beans I ever had.  I'm not feeling too hot these last couple days. I don't know whether it's the
beans or something I've been eating or something that's been causing my stomach to hurt real bad.
 You're sure not digging in like you usually do, buddy. (chuckles)  Oh, he's taking it slow and
steady.  Yeah. I'm used to some type of situations like this when I was
in, uh, Afghanistan or different-- other military spots, so-- I never like to show weakness
anywhere I go. I always want to be looked upon as one of the stronger ones. While everybody is doing their
normal activities, I got to pretend that I'm happy, but really inside, it's miserable. (chuckles)
I'm-I'm trying to fight through this. I figure another day or so, I should be good.
(groans)  How you feeling, Jerry?  Mother said there'd be days like this.
 Yeah. (Jerry chuckles)
 There are a bunch over here. You want to move on this side?  Yeah, sure. I see some over here.
 There's a couple in there, small ones.  There are a bunch of small ones over here.
 There's some right-right under me.  Drop it. He was right here.
Let's make sure.  We got fishing gear in the challenge yesterday, and we were all so psyched.
We assume... I think we all imagined that we would be feasting on plates of fish.  I see some over here.
 There's a couple in there, small ones.  There's a big one right here. If we can get it over enough, we
can catch him.  Toss it far.  One, two, three. You threw it on my head.
 I'm sorry.  That might, it might be all right.  No, he got out.
 We're having a lot of problems catching minnows. We're not entirely sure how to use the net.
J.T. thinks it's a throw net, but it seems way too big for one person to throw. So we... I think we need to
figure out a good system.  One, two, three.
It's still not easy, but, you know, we figured out, you know, live bait with the minnows is definitely the way to go.
This water is just a little different from where I came from, but we'll get it under control.
 Oh, baby, come on in.  You see him?  Got him.  Woo-hoo!
 Attaboy.  All right. Attaboy, J.  Think this may be first fish
I've ever caught.  Oh, it is. Good.  Oh, oh!
I got one, buddy!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! Whoa!
That is a fish. Hello, dinner.  That's right.  My biggest fish yet.
 I could eat.  Today is the first day I feel really hungry.  Look at that.
 That one looks delish.  Oh, my God. It's like a feast. Mmm.
 It's amazing how it doesn't need seasoning. It just tastes well seasoned, doesn't it?
 Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys.  Did you eat that skin?
 That fish tasted just like victory. Just knowing that we got a little food, finally using the
fishing gear the way it should be used, I think it means that we're just a force to be reckoned with right now.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! Jalapao getting your first look at the new Timbira. Candace voted out at the last
Tribal Council. For today's challenge, six members of each tribe will be blindfolded and tied together
in pairs. The remaining tribe member will guide you through a maze. You'll locate your bucket, then
make your way to a water tower, where you must fill your bucket, then race back to the start and empty the water into a
container, raising a flag. You'll then repeat the process, this time collecting corn from another tower.
First tribe to fill both containers, raising both flags, wins reward. Want to know what you're
playing for?  Yes, please!  PROBST: It starts with this tarp.
 Oh! (shrieking)  PROBST: It includes an umbrella, chairs, pillows,
blankets, and a hammock. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member of the losing tribe to go to Exile
Island, and that person will select somebody from the winning tribe to join them. Worth playing for?
 Yes.  PROBST: Give you a minute to figure out who's gonna be blindfolded, who's gonna be the
guide. We'll get started. The caller for Jalapao: Joe. For Timbira: Debra.
Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go!  J.T., Sydney, go left.
Y'all start moving, Spencer.  Straight! Straight!  PROBST: Take a lot of
teamwork to figure this out.  Straight, straight, straight!  J.T., start inching left.  PROBST: First thing you have
to do is find your buckets. Each pair will have a bucket.  I got a bucket.  PROBST: J.T.'s got a bucket.
 Right, right, right! Faster! Forward! Forward, forward, forward!
 PROBST: Sierra's got a bucket.  Get on that rail! Go right! Go right!
 PROBST: Taj has got a bucket. Spencer's got a bucket. Jalapao has their buckets. Now you got to start collecting
water.  Spencer, water's to your right!  Water's on your right, right!
 Step straight! It is on your right!  PROBST: Tyson has his bucket.  Keep going! Keep going!
 Here, here, here. Put the bucket right here. Stephen getting some water for Jalapao.
 Where's the water?  Straight! Right, right, right! You're there!
You've got it, girls. Okay, go!  PROBST: Sierra and Erinn getting a little water for
Timbira. Spencer and Stephen heading back with water for Jalapao.  Spencer, you're doing great,
bubba. Keep coming straight. Slow down. Oh, no! My bad!
All right, to your left.  We need to go back and get our buckets.  PROBST: Taj now has water,
heading back for Jalapao.  Brendan! Where is our bucket?  Brendan, go out straight to
your left, to your left! Left! Left! Left! Left!  PROBST: Brendan and Jerry doing their own thing.
 Okay, Spencer, keep coming. You're right on the holster. You feel the pegs?  Here, here, here.
 Okay, now pour. Good job, guys. Go!  All right, let's go back.
 Back up, back up. Come back towards me!  Brendan, no! That's not ours!
Around the other side!  PROBST: Brendan still trying to find his bucket. Timbira in trouble early.
 Left!  Come on, baby, let me get it.  PROBST: Jalapao, empties their second bucket.
 Stop, stop! Get down behind you. By your butt, by your butt, by your butt.
 Okay, I got it, I got it.  PROBST: Brendan and Jerry finally get their bucket. Timbira falling way behind.
 Oh, yeah.  J.T. and Sydney head back with water for Jalapao. J.T. to your left, bro.
To your left.  Tyson is going to lead. You guys follow me.  Let's go, Tyson.
 Come on, Tyson, walk! No, not yet. Not yet. Okay, J.T., pour. That's good.
 PROBST: Jalapao has three buckets in. Timbira has yet to dump any water.
 Okay, go, go, go!  Okay, now we're ready.  Straight, straight, Tyson!  PROBST: Tyson leading one
long Timbira trail. Timbira is in slow motion in this challenge.  Come left! Come left!
Left, left! You'll feel Stephen.  Tyson, stop, stop! Left!
Follow it to the end. Come straight. There it is. Forward!
There you go.  That's the water?  That's water.  This ours?
 PROBST: Timbira starts dumping their water.  It's right in front of you. Keep coming straight.
Yes, yes, yes! Pour!  PROBST: Stephen pouring. Will this be enough water?
It is.  Let's go!  PROBST: Jalapao now looking for corn.
Timbira still pouring their water, trying to raise that flag.  Dump it.
Okay!  PROBST: Timbira very close on the water, but they're going to need a little more.
They got to go all the way back.  J.T., to your left!  PROBST: J.T. has the corn. He's filling his barrel...
and his face.  Go straight, straight!  PROBST: Jalapao's entire tribe is at the corn tower.
Timbira still needs a little water.  Right, right! Right! Right!
Right there! Forward!  To your right, J.T. To your right, J.T.
To your right, J.T.  PROBST: Jalapao has worked well together from the start. Spencer and Stephen now heading
back.  Debbie, do we need all three buckets of water?!  Just start coming!
I don't know! I can't see it! PROBST: J.T. and Sydney dumping that first bucket of corn.
 Nobody's holding me.  I don't know where everybody is.  PROBST: Timbira, really
blowing this challenge.  Come on, Timbira.  Spencer, put your right hand down.
The trough is right there.  This is it. This is it.  You got to bring more at a
time!  Where is it? Where is it? I got it.  That's good. That's good.
 PROBST: That's it! (cheering) Jalapao wins reward! (cheering)
 Oh, my God. I love you guys. (screaming angrily)  Way to go, Joe.
(groaning)  PROBST: Jalapao, congratulations.  Thank you.
 PROBST: First decision you have to make, who from Timbira are you going to send to Exile Island?
 Brendan.  PROBST: Brendan once again going to Exile.  PROBST: All right,
Brendan, who from Jalapao do you want to join you at Exile?  Taj.  PROBST: Same pair going back
again. Spencer, does that concern you at all that the same two people are going back yet again, have
time together?  It seems like both tribes are using the same strategy, so I'm not entirely shocked.
 PROBST: Brendan, your map, not that you need it. Head down to the beach.  Bye, baby.
 PROBST: You'll both be back in time for the next immunity challenge. Jalapao, grab your stuff.
Head out. You've got a lot it carry.  Oh, my gosh.  PROBST: Camp life at Jalapao
just got a whole lot better. Sadly, Timbira, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.  We've got to turn it around, just for every reason imaginable: pride, the rewards,
the anger that I'm feeling. Winners find a way to win. Losers find a way to lose. We've got it get it together.
(thunder rumbles)
 Yes.  Yeah, I know it.  I think we need to have a little talk later.
 What happened?
 No, it wasn't.  I let out a scream at the end of the challenge, a primal yell that was about a quarter
of what I felt inside because I was just so... I was so pissed off.  If we give in right now to
it, it's...  Give in? We're not giving in.  I mean, just like, give in to
the anger or the upsetness.  I was totally embarrassed. I mean, there's no other word for it.
We were humiliated.  Now, my biggest thing is I just feel like I've let everybody down.
 I mean...  Sierra said you guys couldn't hear me. And I was screaming at the top
of my lungs. Maybe that was the problem. I was screaming instead of...  It's not like we're not all
trying.  No, not at all.  There's nothing about trying. I mean, the last that thing we
should do... And I beg all of you to not go off in groups and say, "Man, you know, Erinn really screwed
up today or Debbie really screwed up today," because that would be the worst thing we could do.
 So, what are you thinking?  People are just panicked in the challenges. Did you see...
Have you seen Sierra?  Yeah.  She screams. She's like, "Aah! I can't hear!
Aah!" Every time. I'm just like, "Oh, my goodness. I mean, who's worse?
Is it Erinn? Is it, you know, Sierra? I mean, obviously, I want to get Erinn out immediately.
 One word to describe Coach? I think that's it. "Coach." You know?
He's not always the best at what he's coaching, but he thinks he knows the most.  I mean you, me, Sierra, and
Debbie are going to vote Erinn off next. It doesn't matter what Brendan thinks.
I'm sure he'll be with us because that's four to three.  He likes his voice to be heard, which is what we all want
and all need.  And we only just see things. We don't even have to talk. And I think that's going to
be... But as we're getting to know each other, you know...  Yeah.
 The first seven days, I wanted to make sure you saw it the exact same way as I did. (laughing)
 You know what? When he told me I was like his assistant coach, more power to me, you know?
 Cool.  Thank you.  Yup, sweet. I'm glad we're seeing it exactly
the same. I love it.  But he has a little schoolboy crush on me.
People see that. He loves me, you know. So, if I just keep plugging away, I'll eventually make
coach. He may promote me. I don't know if I'll have my own team or will be co-coach,
or whatever. But people are going to start calling me that. I'm actually going to demand it.
If we ever get put on separate tribes in this game, I will demand that the other tribe calls me "Coach," too.
 On three. One, two, three!  Pao!  All right.
 Pao!  Oh, my God.  We did great. I mean, we did.
 That was awesome.  It was like organized chaos.  You did phenomenal. Slow and methodical.
 We won. We won the reward challenge today. It was awesome.
We work very, very well together.  Coach was pissed. "I'm pissed!"
 Hey, if we get this next immunity challenge today, we're sweeping. Timbira's got to be struggling
right now with morale. I mean, I think we put it to them pretty good today. I mean, we could really do some
damage if we won the next challenge.  Hey, can we get somebody else back here to help lift
this up?  We got to run it back here, too.  It's got to come back my way.
 Back this way.  It makes a huge difference to have a tarp because we know it's hard to make a roof rain
proof at this point, and I know they're getting soaked and we're staying dry and that's going to make a big difference
on the next challenge.
 To say... To say something about the fact that not only are they taking those pillows and blankets, they
took my other blanket and brought it to Exile. (thunder rumbles)  Judging on the fact that
Jalapao seems to be a hell of a lot dirtier than us, they probably need that stuff more than we do.
I don't care about comfort. No shelter. Let me bury myself in the sand, get eaten by tarantulas and
bitten by snakes. I don't care about comfort anymore. I don't want care about
anything else except for winning this game.
 You must choose... Each choose an urn. Oh, damn.  Is it empty?
I keep doing the same thing. Oh, no. I got it this time. Open in private.
All right. I'll be back in two seconds.  Okay.  Clue Two.
"You must search around. You can and you should. The item desired is surround by wood."
 Uh-oh. (Taj laughs)  What do we got?  It's back home.
It's surrounded by wood.  We got another clue.  We got another clue. We got another clue.
 Oh, perfect. Perfect!  Oh, good. Brendan and I back in Exile
Island. He's kind of working right along with me. We both have the same goals in
mind in that we're trying to find the idol so we can both be safe in the long run. So, then, we have at least three
days... Or two days after we get back from Exile to find it on our own.
 When I get back to camp, I'm going to look for the idol immediately and the first place I'm going to look is something
that's surrounded by wood. When I hear, "surrounded by wood," I think of my shelter. I think of the tree mail area.
So that's probably where I'll take a peek.
The key is getting the immunity idol.  I know. If we don't find it by the time
somebody else gets here and gets a clue, then we're outed. Unless we can convince them to send us again.
 God... Hopefully, we can and we'll work on that.  Right.
 But if we can't, who else do we send?  Steve. Do Steve and I'll prep him
before the next challenge, so he'll know.  Okay. So then, like, I'll go to
Sierra.  Are you sure you can trust Sierra?  Yeah, I think I can.
 Okay.  I'll make sure.  You work Sierra. I'll work Steve.
 Yeah.  Once we make it to the merge, we would have a four-way alliance that nobody knows
about.  That nobody knows about.  Exactly. If Brendan and I can line up
our cards exactly the way we want them, we'll have a secret four-way alliance that no one knows about.
This is going to slap them behind the head and they won't even know it was coming.  You're the best accomplice
ever. Ever! (laughing)

 Overall, though, I was happy that it rained. I knew they were getting wet.  Oh, my God, except for T.G.
 Yeah, I try not to think about T.G. (indistinct talking)  Yeah.
 You all right?  I'm great. Last night was cold and raining and miserable.
But for Jalapao, it was awesome. We had the best sleep of our lives. We had our blankets, we had our
new shelter, and we had the knowledge that Timbira was having a miserable night. So that made us all sleep pretty
soundly.
 Oh, dear. Oh, boy. (laughing) You know, Jalapao is looking great.
I hope Timbira doesn't have it together 'cause if we got 'em on their heels, now is the time to put 'em down, and that's what
I'm hoping for. ♪ ♪

 Welcome back, T.G.  (laughs)  PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
 OTHERS: Yeah!  PROBST: First things first. Sandy, I will take it back.  Okay.
Bye. We'll see you soon.  We don't think so. (laughter)
 PROBST: Let's get to it. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will race to roll a large, tri-colored
crate back to your mat. Once you've gathered all six crates, you must stack them to build a staircase that spells
out your tribe name. First tribe to correctly stack the crates and get all their tribe members to the top of the
tower wins immunity. Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home. Big enough stakes?
 OTHERS: Yeah. Yes.  PROBST: Give you a minute to strategize; we'll get started. First pair for Jalapao: J.T. and
Taj. For Timbira: Brendan, Debra. For immunity. Survivors ready?
Go!  Come on, guys, come on!  Go, guys!  Come on, guys!
 Let's go, T.G.!  Good job, Brendan, Debbie. Let's go, you guys got it.  Yeah! Come on, guys!
You got it!  Good job, y'all! Straighten it out.  PROBST: J.T. and Taj doing a
nice job. They'll be back first. Stephen and Sydney out on the course for Jalapao.

 Come straight this way! Keep it straight!  PROBST: Spencer and Taj still fighting.
Brendan and Tyson back for that final crate. Start working on it.  This will be our bottom
block, you guys. That's right. That's right.  PROBST: Keep digging. Get it over there.
Jalapao's back. Start working on it.  I think this is gonna be the first step right here.
 Push.  PROBST: You're building a staircase that will spell out your tribe name.
 Right here. This is it. Okay.  All right. Now this one.  This one, it's this one. It's this one; it goes there.
 PROBST: Erinn is leading her tribe.  And then that means that you have half an "A" on that side.
That's right. That's right.  PROBST: Giving Timbira a big lead.  ...two, three, lift. Go.
 PROBST: Everybody working together on Jalapao, still staying in there.  Now twist it around.

 No.  Are you sure?  "T-I" is right here.  Come here, look.
T-I-M-B-I... The "A" is gonna be up top here.  So is that it right there, because on the other...
 No, it's right there; it's right there; it's right there.  We need to go.  PROBST: Timbira now slowing

 I'm beat.
 PROBST: Jalapao, congratulations.  (whoops)  Yeah!
 There you go, girl.  (laughs)  PROBST: Jalapao, I got nothing for you.
You guys have the night off. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.  (whoops)
 PROBST: Timbira, momentum has definitely shifted. Three straight wins by Jalapao. Another loss, another trip to
Tribal Council, another tribe member going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
I will see you at Tribal tonight.  I feel a great deal of responsibility for the loss
today because I couldn't give it my all. I'm weak. I'm-I'm real weak. My stomach just feels so bad.
It's like, uh, somebody's in there with... two boxers in there boxing around. But, uh, I'm pretty sure that
everybody started looking at me like, uh, "Jerry's not getting any better. He's probably the weakest link
on the tribe, so maybe get rid of him." (bird squawks)  How you feeling, Jerry?
Better?  I'm gonna go take a dip.  Okay.  Jerry, there's some extra
water over here. Do you want me to fill your canteen?
You sure?  Yeah, I got plenty here. But I felt pretty good when we went down and got that first
block, but after that all my energy was zapped. But I'm trying to... trying to... endure.
Trying to tough it out best I can. I'm not gonna quit, though. That's for sure.
I'm not a quitter. (chuckles) They got to vote me out. I'm not giving up.
 I think we had a communication breakdown at some point today, and I can't quite figure out what it was.
 We got this, we're just... it's just the beginning of the game.  We're just one behind.
We're one person behind now.  Yeah, it's, like, no big deal; we'll figure it out. Is Jerry okay?
 The beans are making him sick, and that's all we... you know, we can't eat all the rice.  Shut up.
 'Cause he won't eat the beans.  He can't... he hasn't eaten, really, in... since you've left.
 The most unfortunate thing about this whole situation is that as soon as Erinn realized that Jerry was not sick, she
turned around and looked at the tribe with the evil sneer, kind of like... "I'm staying."
 What?  I'm so pissed off, man. When she saw Jerry, it registered that she was still
staying. She went... I'm not kidding you; I practiced her look. She went like this.
It was the evilest look. I can't stand it, man.  That's why I'm talking to Jerry and telling him to stay
strong so we can get rid of her.  I think my relationship with Tyson started out like head coach/assistant coach.
But I go to him first because if he's my right-hand man, if he's my general, then I want to make sure that we're clear with
our orders.  Let's still go with Erinn. But Debbie and Sierra, those are the two I'm gonna have to talk
to.  I mean, we're only as strong as our weakest link.  Well, yeah, she did know she
was going home if Jerry wasn't sick.  Yeah, and it just makes me sick because I-I exist... to
surround myself with people that have integrity, and I cannot exist around people like that. You guys can because you can
socialize with them. I am so true... that existing around people that smile evilly when somebody else is on their
knees kills me. I can't exist around... I can't look at her in camp, I can't walk by her now.
 Coach is definitely pissed about voting out Jerry, but I am honestly not going to sever off another limb so that we can get
our vendettas against Erinn.  She's still an asset to a certain extent. In the beginning when they saw
me  sick and they saw  me  weak, they were gonna vote me out. So, as much as I have grown to actually like and be fond of
Jerry, I'm not gonna be stupid.
 You gotta stay strong, man. You gotta... stick it in there if you can, you know.
Don't... yeah, don't give up.  Yeah.
What do you have in mind?  Erinn.  Erinn?  She was right on board with
Candace. To me, it looks like she's just here to lie and deceive and... you know, get ahead any way
she can.  Has anybody been talking about voting me out?  No, nobody has.
You try and look as strong as you can. Don't say anything to anybody.
 Yeah.
(thunder rumbling)  With Tribal Council coming, I I knew I only had a couple of hours to get my act together
and go look for the idol, and so I immediately kind of went to the one place that made the most sense to me, and that was
kind of the statue next to tree mail. And I got up to it, and, like, started shaking the thing, and
nothing happened. And I finally just, like, pushed it out and, like, tried to look underneath it because I thought
it might be there. It wasn't there. And then just started kind of feeling around and looking at
the skirt, and then kind of lifted up the skirt on the backside of it and saw a little hole and there was the idol.
Yes! That makes not eating for a couple of days worth it.
Good, good, good news. It all worked out. You know, the plan worked, which was perfect.
As an entrepreneur, when I think about business, like, to me it was never about making money, and even with  Survivor
it's not about making money. I love winning games, I love playing games, competing and winning them.
So as long as you're focused on doing something that you love and you're playing the game the right way, good stuff happens.
Keep my fingers crossed.
 Jerry, you want some beans?
 Like you don't want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's sick, but you kind of want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's
sick. And trying to, like, wrestle with all these options of, like, how do you bring it up
delicately, how do you make it look like you're not trying to throw someone under the bus or save your own ass because every
time we send someone home who doesn't want to be here it leaves a space for someone who does and I want to be here so
see you, Jerry.  Where's the thumb meter? Sideways?  I'm doing better.
Thumb is sideways right now. It was down; now it's sideways.  It's moving up.  Yeah, it's moving up.
Taste of a good cheeseburger, I'd be back on top. (laughing)
 Yeah, I think Jerry's illness has put a couple of eyeballs on him. I mean, if he's in pain and
can't compete in the challenges, if he's the weak link and it comes to Tribal Council, he could be the next
one to go. But anytime there's a blindside, it's pretty awesome, just the look on somebody's
face. I think Erinn wants to be here so, so bad, that her getting blindsided would look really
cool. I love seeing people cry when you crush their dreams.
 PROBST: Tyson, let's talk about momentum. Jalapao clearly has it. How important is it in a game
like this?  Momentum's extremely important. I think we got a little bit
arrogant, and they're on a high right now, and we're on a low. I mean, it doesn't take much to regain momentum, just a win.
If we can all focus and get together then it can flip-flop pretty fast.  PROBST: Well, what I noticed
today in the challenge was Erinn right off the bat said, "I have a plan, let's follow it," and it was over.
 That's exactly what happened. I said, "This piece goes here." Everybody said, "No, no, no,
that's not right." People panicked and we all did nothing and then went, "Oh, yeah, okay, that is right."
And it was too late by then.  PROBST: How frustrating is that for you when you felt like you knew it all along?
 I... it was just frustrating.  PROBST: Brendan, do you think this group communicates as well
as it needs to?  I think we communicate very well.  PROBST: Jerry, you were
shaking your head back and forth as fast as you could.  Well, for instance, in today's challenge, if we'd of
had a controlling person to say, "Okay, you got it; we're all going to listen to you, bam." But that didn't happen.
We just need to establish a leader.  PROBST: Who should it be, Jerry?
 I think it should be... Brendan.  PROBST: Coach, you agree with that; Brendan's the guy that
should be leading this tribe?  Being the devil's advocate, let's say Brendan is the leader; he has to take the
reins. I'm not suggesting that I'm the leader, but on the truck I was making eye contact with
everybody and the reason why it worked so smoothly is because I basically told everybody with my eyes to get what they needed
to get.  PROBST: So it sounds like you should be leading.  Well, absolutely, I would
love to be leader. That's what I'm used to doing.  PROBST: Erinn you had about five different reactions.
Just share one with me.  I think it's a role that Coach is used to. It's a role that he would love
to be in, but it's something that Brendan does better.  PROBST: Coach?  Again, I'm not criticizing
Brendan, but we've lost three challenges in a row and for her to be so quick to say that, I think comes more to a
personality clash between us two.  I didn't know we had a personality clash.
You have these great ideas, but I don't ever see you saying more than, "Well, I have this idea, but you guys do whatever
you're going to do."  PROBST: So you're saying he's a little passive-aggressive, throwing
throwing out an idea, but not owning it?  Uh-huh.  PROBST: Coach, is that hard
to hear? 'Cause it sounds like what you're struggling with a little bit is ego.
 It's not about ego because I would rather toe the line and be a good assistant coach than try to be a head coach and
stroke my ego. What I was doing was I was justifying why I should be the leader, and why I registered
surprise when Erinn said it's Brendan.  PROBST: Jerry, how is tonight's vote going to make
this tribe better?  I think tonight's vote will make this tribe better because it will get rid of the weakest
person.
 PROBST: All right, it is time to vote. Coach, you're up.
 I hope you feel better.
 Love you, sweetheart, but we made a decision.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
First vote: Jerry.
Jerry. Two votes Jerry.
Erinn. Two votes Jerry; one vote Erinn.
Jerry. That's three votes Jerry; one vote Erinn.
Third person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Jerry. That's four; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
Jerry, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.
Well, according to you guys, tonight's vote was all about making this tribe stronger. Time will tell if you made the
right decision or not. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

 PROBST: Next time on Survivor:  at Jalapao, Sydney turns on the charm.  I definitely try to flirt
when it comes to this game.  PROBST: And the Timbira tribe loses their heads... while Taj keeps hers in the
game.
 As far as my experiences in Afghanistan and the military career, this by far was the toughest thing I have endured
in my life. I don't know what happened to my stomach, but in 130-degree heat and me not being able to
eat anything took a toll on my body. I'm hoping and praying that one of my tribe members will win
that million dollars.
