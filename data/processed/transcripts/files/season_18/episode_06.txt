 PROBST: The first 15 days of Survivor: Tocantins  have seen some of the most memorable castaways yet.
They've been competing fiercely in one of the most unforgiving environments in the world. This is what you've seen so
far. Survivors ready? Go! Timbira wins immunity!
 That's not okay.  Who the hell do you think you are?  That will get old really
quick.  PROBST: Carolina, the tribe has spoken. Candace trying to take Taj down.
J.T. fakes out Jerry! Jalapao wins. You're now going to send one member of Timbira to Exile
Island.  Now, to the twist, choose one member of the winning tribe to join you.
 Taj.  You work Sierra. I'll work Steve. We would have a four-way
alliance that nobody knows about.  That nobody knows about.  Exactly.
 You're the best accomplice ever.  I think they're going to be under- or overcooked.
 Hopefully, Candace has her bags packed because she is out of here.  PROBST: The tribe has spoken.
 Debbie!  Brendan!  Debbie, where's our bucket?  I don't know.
I can't see it!  PROBST: Jalapao wins immunity!  I found the idol.
Yes!  Hey, everybody, Jerry's sick. See you, Jerry.  PROBST: Timbira does win
immunity!  I'm voting for Sandy because she's crazy.  Do you want to be a part of
the biggest upset on  Survivor history?  Yes, I do.  Okay, stuff this in your
pocket. Do something with it. Hide it.  I might have just stumbled
ass-backwards into a huge alliance.  J.T.!  PROBST: J.T., unbelievable!
 Yeah, J.T.!  Launch!  PROBST: Timbira wins immunity!
 Somebody has to go tonight. It's gotta be Spence.  PROBST: Fifth person voted out of  Survivor: Tocantins.
Tonight, a special episode of Survivor,  with new scenes highlighting your favorite contestants...
and giving deeper insight into the game.

♪ ♪
 PROBST: Enduring the intense heat of the Brazilian highlands, traveling on a dusty, endless road to nowhere, this season's
castaways were split into two tribes, and they were about to begin a cutthroat game where first impressions meant
everything.  Being in the back of that truck really did give you a good amount of time to just
kind of size everybody up and see what you're up against.  As for first impressions with people, I try not to come
into it with too many because I think that gets you in trouble a lot of times.  My first impression of the
girl in the gray striped T-shirt, obviously, was upset; she had her head down, and, yes, it was hot, we were all hot, but
we weren't showing it. And so, I really didn't feel like she wanted to be here with us.
 It was blazing hot. I had a fever. I was so sick. I didn't even give a flying
... what they thought about me.
 Whoa!
 PROBST: You will have 60 seconds to gather as much as you can. Your time starts now because
this game is on!  Get down. I'll hand it to you.  Here, hand it to me.
 We have the long-haired guy that, uh, looks like the love child of Stephen Segal and the last of the Mohicans.
So, if he can pull any of those skills out, you know, survival skills like an Indian or, uh, karate moves like Stephen Segal,
he's a good guy to have on your side, I think.  I plan on day one to take the leadership role.
Now, is that going to be a shared role? It depends. The characteristics and the
qualities that I have as an individual has been forged like an iron thrown into the fire and coming out unshakable,
unbreakable, invincible like a sword. I know who I am.  We are screwed.
They have Stephen Segal. What the hell are we going to do against the (indistinct) man? I have no idea.
We clearly have, physically, a weaker tribe. Um, there's the hot, blonde girl.
It really is going to be a shame when we have to vote her off.  I guess I'm, you know, a
professional model now. I mean, I've been doing it for three and a half years, but, um, yeah, I don't know, it's still
kind of funny to me because I just, I laugh at myself a lot.  PROBST: You guys have a long journey ahead of you.
You need to get to camp. You need to start working on shelter.
The tribes began an epic four-hour journey toward their camps, but Jalapao stumbled out of the gate.
 This was our mark, right? I'm not afraid to run back to the road and look at it.  I think that might be our
best point, our best idea.  You think so?  Yeah, I would definitely because I'm not sure what tree
we're looking at.
 As long as we don't veer off that line, I know we do avoid trees and stuff, it will still be the same degree.
 That's true. That's true, all right.  If we just hit that strip of palm trees, we'll be fine.
 Well, J.T.'s, he's from 'Bama  That's right.  J.T. is more of a brawn guy, not your sophisticate,
intellect, academia-type guy.  People's impression of me might be that I'm a hillbilly sometimes, uh, but I consider a
hillbilly someone uneducated. I don't think a hillbilly would make it very far in this game. Uh, there's no doubt in my mind
I can win or I'd have stayed at home. I'm here to win and I'm going to win.
 Are we going the right way, y'all? My biggest strategy going in will just be "kill them with
kindness." I'll be so nice to them, they're not going to want to kick me off.
You guys okay? Okay. Because another thing I think that they're probably
underestimating about me is that I look fat. But I'm not really fat. I'm muscular.
So, when I'm winning challenges, they won't have a reason to try to kick me off. They can't.
I'm going to be so good at this they won't be ready for me.  Whoo! (cheering)
(squealing)  Chew it! Chew it! Don't waste it.  I guess it's like God's
candy.  Is this for real?  Thanks, God.
 PROBST: On their first full day at camp, but without fire to cook their beans...  What happens if you just eat
dry beans?  PROBST: ...Timbira had to resort to other sources of food for much-needed protein.
 Did you get it?  No.  I think it's going to be a lot harder than anybody
realizes out here. Foraging for food is going to be difficult. Dang.
 I'm getting slower, I think. Want to give it a try?  We're trying to catch fish. We've got a burlap bag and
we try to drop different things in and grab fish.  You got one?  Yes, a teeny little one.
 At least it's one.  Eat it. Eat that.  You go, you go, Debbie.
 I'll eat that one that you've got in your hands.  Why, because this guy...  Yeah, 'cause that one's
gross. Ugh!  Put your mouth there.  Uh, okay.
 Chew it! Chew it!  Chew it. Don't just waste it. Yummy, sushi, sashimi.
Mmm.  Okay, it actually did taste a little like sushi. That is definitely not in my
character, but I threw it in my mouth and chewed it up as quick as I could to get a little protein.
I cannot believe I just chewed up a live fish in my teeth.  I'm gonna clean these things out.
 The fish, we have just those little minnows to eat, but we found, uh, that fruit that smells like foot.
 Jerry!  Yeah.  All that jatoba. Shut your mouth!
 No, it's really, it's better than eating the...  I'm having a hard time sticking this in my mouth.
 Come on. It's good.  This is a Brazilian fruit called a jatoba, and, uh, it's got like a really hard, like,
pod shell on it, and then inside it's got this almost powdery flesh. It really makes you thirsty.
It kind of sucks all the saliva out of your mouth.
 Is this for real?  Yeah.  Come on. How is it?
 Uh-uh.  But here, there's nothing else to eat, so, it's, I guess it's like God's candy in Brazil.
So, thanks, God.
 PROBST: On day seven, after winning comfort items in a reward challenge, Jalapao's campfire was out and getting the
fire restarted proved to be a tough task. (metal and wood scratching)
 I'm doing something wrong here.
 Try to strike into it more.  Like that?
 Strike it.  Strike it.  There you go.  Strike it. Like, hit it.
 There you go.  That's how I did it.  Stephen really wanted to make a fire because he's never
made a fire. He's out there with the flint, with the machete, dinging away. It was hilarious.
He could not make a freaking spark.
 On the scale of 1 to 100, my wilderness skills are at about a 1. I cannot make fire, and that is
embarrassing. Aah! I'll do it some other time. This is stupid.
 Sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right. I might not be able to start
it, either. (chuckles)
 I grew up fishing with my dad outdoors all the time, so I've-I... you know, I've lived the
outdoors.
I'm not just a girly girl, you know. I'm not just some pretty girl that they're...
You know, they can flirt with.
(sighing)
 Yes.  Good job, Syd.  Oh, nice, Sydney. Fuego.
(chuckles)  At first, Sydney was definitely getting by on her looks, on her charm, on her
girlish laugh. But Sydney made fire for us, you know? She's a woodland goddess and I
think, for that reason, she's a big threat to me. (laughing)  PROBST: At Timbira, Tyson was
busy enhancing the first impression he'd made on his fellow castaways, proving that value to a tribe can come in
many ways.  I smell like a man today.
(laughing) They think I just always smell like flowers and exotic fruits.
Who am I? Um...
Oh, that question. Who am I?
Pretty well-balanced individual, I'd say.  Oh, my God!  Let's win!
 Oh, God. (gasping)  Tyson never, ever ceases to amaze me.
 I can do that. (laughing)  Oh, my God.  See?
 Did you see the arch in his back?  Yeah, you have to do the arch.
It pops better.  I don't even know how to do the arch thing. Honestly, I think Tyson is
somebody that everybody better watch out. I think Tyson has the real potential to win this game.
 Try and get through this.  A little Tai Bo here, or what? Are you sparring?
What are you doing?  I was going to kick her in the (bleep). (laughing)
 Tyson, he's always cracking a joke. One of a kind. I mean, that's probably what
attracts me to him so much, you know, not in a sexual way.  Take you to the ground right here.
(laughing) Ow.  What you doing, Debbie? (laughing)
 Debbie.  I want you to stop.  Stop doing that to me. My parents are going to see
that, Debra!  You weren't very quick to get off.  That is not lady-like.
 I slipped and got stuck!  I don't know what you were doing. I was bent over looking at the
ground and you jumped right on top. Your boobs popped out?  Maybe.
 That's fitting. I'm not the stereotypical Mormon. I respect the church and the
people in it, but for myself, personally, you know, there's things I want to do and not necessarily that are sinning.
 Oh, no!  We'll see what happens when I get home and everyone disowns me.
Okay, team, I got tired of the rope.  Oh, yeah, look at that. (laughing)
 Debbie!  Oh, my God.  Debbie!
 You'll never be able to have children again.  I don't care. I'll probably have to move
somewhere else, somewhere less Mormony.
 Make beans? I've always seen two people do it.  Sierra, we've got to do
chores by ourselves. We can't all hold each other's hands.  Don't talk to me like I'm
stupid.  I'm just saying it doesn't take two people. I was not being condescending.
> I'm pissed.
 How many handfuls of beans should I do?  PROBST: Sierra made a bad first impression with her
Timbira tribemates, but by day eight, her strength seemed to be returning and Coach was ready to put her to work.
 Sierra, how about you cook the beans?  Make fire and the beans?  You'd have only one person
doing it. One person putting the firewood on the fire, same person cooking the beans, and nobody stomping
around.  I've always seen two people do it.  That's why we're getting
stuff in our beans and our rice because there are too many people around there. I'm watching the stuff fly up
in the air while stuff is cooking. Sierra, you put a log on the fire, then put another log on
the fire, and then stir the beans, and then wait.  Yeah, I understand.  Put another log on the fire.
It doesn't take two people.  Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.  I'm just saying it doesn't
take two people.  Yeah, but it's nice to have someone, like a female, like tending the fire and then one's
cooking and then... You know what I mean? It's nice to...  Sierra, we've got to do
chores by ourselves. We can't all hold each other's hands, and for to you say that you want somebody there to talk
to, I mean, there's a lot of stuff to do.  Yeah.  You know, we got to...
 I know and I've been part of it since day one.  I know that, but I'm just saying we got to start
doing stuff independently, as well.  Okay, that's fine. What are you guys going to be
doing while I'm doing that?  Fishing.  All of you are going to go fishing?
 We're going to take about four of us down there and see if we can just surround them and fish.
 Okay.  Is that going to stress you out? It looks like it's stressing
you out.  Why don't you talk to me from over here, so you don't get dirt in the beans?
(chuckling) I'm one of the ones working the hardest, so... I'm really getting tired of
people like Coach saying things, "You need to do this," and shaking their finger and coming down on me.
They think they can 'cause they think they're older than me and they think they're more knowledgeable.
Um, it's only going to make me turn on them faster.  I can be very condescending, but as a leader or just as a
person, that's not somebody that I want to be. I was not being condescending towards Sierra.
I was actually just trying to wean her from the (bleep), so to speak. I don't think she's going to
fully realize her potential when people keep coddling her.
There's a bunch of big, juicy ones up there.
 Uh-huh.
 It's been a bountiful tree, hasn't it been?  Yeah.  Not very talkative.
 I'm pissed.  So, you want me to tell you why I was picking on you?  Yeah.
 I was gently trying to push you out of the nest. And I just... I wanted to see you like,
expand yourself because I know you can.  Mm-hmm.  You know, there's this part
of your personality that is very dependent and there's this part of your personality that's very independent.
 That's true.  Same as me. But you can never coast in life, in this game, and you
know that.  Now that I think about it and start to, like, cool off, I don't think Coach thinks I'm
stupid. I think he has higher expectations for me than he does for other people.
He thinks of me as a strong female. You're going to be harder on that one just so that they play
harder in a game. And I think that's what... where his mind's really at. And I could very well be wrong,
but I think there's some good intent behind it.  Thanks, Coach.
 PROBST: Later that day, at Jalapao, the muck and grime of the game gave Sydney another chance to prove her worth.
 Look at this. Is that a... That is wild. Nice.
Look at... Looky here. Birthmark there. It is so dirty out here.
We live in ash, and it clings to you.  Get away from me.  Every morning we get dirtier
and dirtier, so it's, um... It's been kind of annoying for us. I mean, I'm totally down for a
floor. And that would solve all of our problem with the soot, with the palms.
J.T. has had the plan to lift our shelter off the ground, and it's a good idea. You know, why not try it?
And I wanted to show him that I'm behind him 100%, and let's just do it. Let's go.
This is going to be awesome.  I don't think I'm the leader of Jalapao. I've just always been one where
I'm ready to get something done, I do it myself. So, I'm not doing it just to be the leader or do anybody else
any favors. I'm doing it because I want to get it done, and that's the best way to do something.
 Wow.
 Can I contribute here?
Is there anything I can do here? Tying? Digging? Posting?
 Uh...  I did think Stephen was somewhat nerdy when we started out.
It feels like I have a little brother or sidekick. He's definitely a city boy.  I think we're kind of going
along as we go, but we could definitely use your help, yeah.
I think J.T. holds the power right now. So I'm definitely trying to get on his good side a little bit.
I think people have their first impressions of me, and, you know, and I always try to prove that wrong.
I think we did a really good job on... on, you know, getting the floor off the ground. I'll sleep better tonight.
That's for sure.
(thunder rumbling)
 PROBST: The battle for tribe leader had been ongoing between Brendan and Coach at Timbira, and on day eight, they went
toe-to-toe to provide comfort for the tribe.  Hey, Coach, when you do the seat...
 Yes.  ...can you... any chance you could put ropes in between it? I think it's more comfortable...
 I was actually going to put three together.  Oh, put three together.  I was going to put three
together.  But it's got to be comfortable this time.  The thing is, is that every
time I make another seat around here, everybody uses it and I don't even get it use my own seat.
 Well, you're making it for the good... making your own personal seat.  No, I'm not!
I'm just saying...
 No.  I would love something to do.  Give me some twine. I'll undo the twine.
 A bench-making contest?  Yes.  Ooh, I love to see the alpha men go at it.
 Coach is definitely a character. We're competing here and there but to me, this is about having
a good time. That's what we came out here to do, and so any time, you know, you're not, you should kind of
check yourself and be like, let's do it.
 Coach needs it more than I do.  I've got longer rope. Funky.
 There is a very serious vying for the spot of alpha male contest happening right now. I don't think it has anything to
do with benches or swings or seats. I think it's who can come out on top, as usual.
 Put your ass going in between the two.  That's even worse.  Oh, please.
 This is terrible, man!  Tearing the tribe apart, guys.  The ladies will come over
and judge.  So we're having a bench- building contest, which we love. Because now we have more places
to sit.  Now we have more seats. And what my idea is, like, let's start having contests of who can
get the river water faster.  All the time, yeah.  Who can get the beans going the fastest.
 Who can collect the most firewood? We'll judge them all. It will be great.
 Oh, see, I can't leave that.  Oh, this is very comfortable! (Tarzan yell)  I haven't sat on that one
yet.  That's definitely going to be more comfortable.  Yeah, and we said that it
was only about comfort, man. It was not about time. It was not about people.  It was about taking care of
the tribe.  Yeah, I think I know where Coach's button is.  We did not say it.
 Coach, it's not about you. It's about the tribe.  I know it's about the tribe. Why do you think I wanted to
have a bench-building contest in the first place?  This is the most fun I've had in a while.
I'm an entrepreneur, so I started a business. When I think about business, you know, every day, when you
build something from scratch, interacting with people that you've never met before is something I adore.
You know, Coach tries to act like a coach all the time. We're not out here to have a coach.
We don't need one. You know, we're out here to have friends; we're out here to work with people.
 'Cause it will fall down when you sit on it.  This is delicious. Good job.
 That was good.
 PROBST: At Jalapao, Taj, used to a high standard of living back home, was having a hard time adjusting to the elements.
 Your back is really, really bad.  Yeah.
I can't believe I look like this. I feel like a leper.
 How are you feeling?
Are you all right?  No, I'm fine.  No, you can come on. We're just... I'm chitchatting
with her, man. I know she had a...  I can't look at myself.  I just feel so ugly.
 It must have been really hard last night.  Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. (sobbing)  I got a little emotional because I just looked at
myself...
and I just had a moment because I just... I don't know what's going on. My back is just destroyed.
And I still have to go home. So I just don't want to go home looking like a wreck.  One of the hardest things
you've ever done?  You know, it wasn't so much hard. I swear, I can handle this.
It's just the after-effect looking at myself. I'm just like, "Ew!" What am I doing to myself?
What am I doing?  To my body, yeah.  I never felt so ugly before in my life.
Stephen came down and he talked to me and they made me feel better, but...
I'm just having a moment. Everyone has their moments out here, and today is mine. I'm just more determined now.
I cannot go home empty-handed looking like this. (laughs)
 I thought I saw a snake going through the rafters.  Oh, my gosh!
 Oh!
 Coach-- just the biggest joke on the planet.
 PROBST: After a restless night of sleep, on morning ten, Timbira was still making discoveries about the dangers of
their environment.
 I heard something about a snake, too.  It was a nightmare, a flashback from when I was on the
Amazon and a snake wrapped around my neck. I was having that nightmare sometimes; it's reoccurring.
(indistinct audio)  That's okay. I was just like, well...  It's one thing to have that
dream at home and talking in your sleep, but when...  When it could happen here.  Last night, Coach woke up
and screamed, "Snake." Well, we thought he was dreaming and being silly or whatever. Oh, my gosh!
Okay, has anybody else seen this?  What?  That is a snake skin.
 Oh, gross.  This wasn't here yesterday. Oh, my gosh! A snake has shed his skin
right here. Brendan, come see what we found.  I told you I saw a snake in there last night, man.
 I thought you were you were dreaming about it.  Maybe it wasn't a dream.  Oh, my God!
 I swear, man, I looked up and I thought I saw a snake going through the rafters.  Really?
 I'm not kidding. But then I thought it was my reoccurring dream of being in the Amazon.
 They're not going to just come up and bite us while we're sleeping, would they?  They could.
 Okay, this is really freaky. We really got to be careful out here. This place is infested with
snakes, with nasty, poisonous snakes. So I'm being very careful as to where I step.
 Hey, we're in the wild. That's what happens. We're part of their environment.  That just really bums me out.
 PROBST: While over at Jalapao...
...J.T. and Joe enjoyed some good, sporting fun. Though it didn't stop Joe from thinking about the game.
 A little jatoba ball.
 Oh! Right now, it's probably J.T. leading Jalapao. And I don't think there's a lot
of tension between J.T. and I right now.  Oh! You brought the heat.
 It's kind of nice to have somebody you can just let take over and then also, you know, the spotlight isn't on you.
 Take a little saliva off that ball. Maybe it will fly straight.
 That's at least a triple.  My kind of ace in the hole, as compared to J.T., is going to be my strategy and
kind of my social game moving forward.  All right, here you go.
Single.  Is that all?  That was it. He's more of the basic just
kind of provider, you know, kind of just alpha male type of guy.  A little fungo.
 Oh!
Oh, dude. Ow.  Right back at ya. You tried to get me off the plate.
My bad.
 Oh, that's gone.
 What in the hell?  I'd imagine that as we go further on in the game, it will get a little tense, and, you
know, that's something that I'm prepared for. I know that's going to happen.  We better quit or we'll lose
an eye.  I think I won, dude.
(sighs)
 PROBST: After two visits to Tribal Council, spirits were down at Timbira, so Coach called upon his conducting skills to
orchestrate some smiles.  Tonight we're gonna play Peter Tchaikovsky's "March Slav," and it goes like this.
 Okay. (humming lively melody)
(voice deepens, continues singing)
And then I cue the strings. Ready and... (singing minor-key melody) And that means I want a little
crescendo and then a decrescendo. (continues minor-key melody)
(continues singing melody)  Who is this jackass? (singing melody) Coach-- just the biggest
joke on the planet. Like, I'm in a weird position because I don't really like my tribe all that much.
And I don't have the alliances out here, but I think it would be kind of fun to pretend for a while, like, "We are one big
happy family! We're in love. Everything's great." You know, every time I get a
couple more days out here, it's that much closer to a merge. If I can make it that far, it'll be interesting to see how it
plays out. (whooping)  Bravo! Bravo!
(wind whistling) (thunder rumbling)  I have never been so close to another man.
What is that?  You're solid, right?  Yes, dude.  I'll never vote you out.
 I don't perceive him as being near the player that I am.  We have two immunity idols. We have the control.
 But is he entirely trustworthy? (thunder rumbles) Maybe he's not.
 PROBST: On day 13, Coach and Tyson took advantage of an early morning walk to make some long-term plans.
I think that, uh, we get rid of Erinn 'cause she's a cancer.  Here's the thing. We can use... we can use Erinn
for a few votes. She'll stick with us for that long.  Oh, no. I hate doing that.
I hate doing that, and I don't trust her. A lot of people don't want to talk about who's gonna be
eliminated. Tyson and I-- we're thinking about it every day.  Yeah.
 I'm gonna tell you this. I told you from the first day, I'll never vote you out.  Yeah.
 And I'm telling you right now, man to man, I'll never go back on that.  Yeah, me, neither.
 Like I told you, you're the most popular guy in this tribe. You'll be the most popular guy in this game.
I ruffle people's feathers. You know, that's just me.  Yeah.  You say the same thing that I
do, and everybody laughs. I say what you say, and everybody's, like, "Whoa! That was wrong."
I mean, I-I just wanted to just let you know that.  Yeah. I'm the same way.
 Okay. Coach. He's the coach, you know? Right now I'm mostly agreeing with what he says.
But in this game, I... don't perceive him as being near the player that I am.
♪ ♪  PROBST: While across the river at Jalapao, J.T. and Stephen were also discussing the
future of the game.  I-I feel confident that we could now try to find some divisions.
There are four of us; we could find two of them.  I do like having Stephen around.
I mean, he's just from such a different part of the world, and it's hard to imagine we'd ever been friends otherwise.
But I know we'll always be friends now. I think you should lay 'em there and go down there and check it
out.  J.T. and I have formed a bond. I'm excited to be his friend.
He is the likeable Everyman with the sweet Southern drawl and the charming smile.  Now, lay down on your belly
right there.  He's showing me how to fish, how to tie a line. I think he thinks of me as sort
of his sidekick, but is J.T. entirely trustworthy? Maybe he's not. I mean, you're solid, right?
 Yes, dude.  Yeah, okay, me, too.  No doubt. I'm solid with you.
And then we go to the merge, then we start looking towards the final... final three.  Final three. That's it.
 And then, if I win, I take you. You win, you take me? We go to final two.
That'd be awesome.  J.T. has definitely emerged as our tribe leader, and, um, I hope to put myself into a power
position. But I'm not the strongest physical competitor, and so I need to be with J.T. as much as
possible. Things are definitely improving for me in this game, but I know better than to, you know, say
that with certainty.
 PROBST: Later that day, Brendan chose Stephen to join him at Exile... hoping to put in place the final
piece of his Exile alliance with Sierra and Taj.
 Whoa, that's enormous.  That's big, man.  Oh, that's kind of disgusting, actually.
How tall? What, three, four feet?  Yeah, and there's some that fell off down there.
 Oh, man.  Here. It'll be a good boa for you.  A little, uh, a little
decoration? Oh, thank you.  There you go.  I feel pretty, finally.
 When I came out to Exile this time, um, I wanted Stephen's trust. I think Stephen didn't
necessarily believe all this was going on, didn't know me, didn't know Sierra, and so I think it's important that the four of us
trust each other and know that we're going to the finals together. Are you guys solid in your
tribe? Like, there's no fear of you getting eliminated?  I don't think so.
I mean, we thought Erinn might be on the outs.  Yeah. I needed to be very honest with
him, and so I tried to tell him as much as could about my tribe, about how we could work together, just to make him feel
comfortable with that alliance. All right, you ready?  Mm-hmm.
Damn, you're quite the woodman.
(thunder rumbling)  Oh, come on, dude. Who's doing this?  Oh, no!
 (laughs): Are you serious? (thunder rumbling)
I have never been so close to another man. He and I spooned for all we were worth.
Oh, my God, it was raining. It was cold. Nothing could prepare me for lying huddled against, you know,
a hunk of-of man. (thunder rumbles)
 I'm exhausted. I'm...  Um, the night Steve and I had out here on Exile was probably the worst night I've had, and so
we huddled up and spooned all night and had a great bonding experience. Another 20 minutes?
What do we got here?  It's actually coming over the mountain, a little bit.  Ah, there it is.
 Ah, feels good, doesn't it?  Yeah. And that's the one really cool thing about Exile: it's just a
bonding experience far greater than what... than could happen back at our tribes. Look how long our shadows are.
 Oh, God.  Uh... what kind of shapes can you make? (laughs)
 What I  love  about our group is we have a four-person alliance: you have myself; you have Sierra;
you have Taj and Stephen; and we're all, like, it's, like, it's kind of a motley crew.
We have two immunity idols. We have the control, and, you know, hopefully, it'll be smooth sailing from there.
Can you make a... I guess, a "T"?  A cross, yeah.  "H."
Sort of.  I've just met Brendan. We've bonded because we have... we have spooned quite a bit.
And I'm glad right now that I'm in his alliance. But there's a lot that's going on in my tribe right now, and my
priority has to be to make sure that I get to the merge in a really strong place.  No more cuddling once we get
back to the merge tribe, yeah.  Much as I would love to. (laughs): Yeah.
 PROBST: 11 castaways are left. Of the first five votes, three have been blindsides.
What will happen when the challenges get more intense... the rewards bigger... the stakes higher?
 You are such a liar!  PROBST: Will friendships and alliances that formed early continue through the game?
And what twists await? (yelling)  PROBST: Join us next time... as the adventure continues.
(bird screeches)
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on Survivor: Timbira turns on Coach.  We all were frustrated with
Coach.  And the truth shall set you free!  PROBST: And at Jalapao...
 We're going to merge.  We're going to the end.  PROBST: ...the tribe turns on each other.
 It's terrible. I'm going to hell.
 Remember when you kind of...  Yeah.  ...when you wouldn't stop?  Yeah, I remember.
When can we do it again?  You'd probably have to give me, like, ten minutes or something.
 Ten minutes in between?  Yep.  You're a stud.  I know.
I can go all night. (laughs)
