 JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor--  People who don't play this game even half as bold as me,
pisses me off.  PROBST: Coach thought he was in the driver's seat.  I think Taj has to go next.
 PROBST: But Debbie turned on her old ally.  It is not good for me to be attached to Coach.
People are tired of him. Okay, so he's going to think we're voting off Taj. I think we need to go ahead and
get Coach out, but it has to be every single one of us writing it down.  PROBST: So the Jalapao three
and Erinn decided Debbie was too dangerous to keep around.
 Yeah, she goes.  PROBST: Coach was clueless as he watched his longtime ally go home.
Debbie, the tribe has spoken. Can Coach regain control? Five are left, who will be voted out tonight?
 I'm in shock. Tonight at Tribal, I thought I was the one going home when I saw my name.
And then it was Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.  Coach.  Yes, sir?
 What?  That's who wrote your name down.  I can't grasp that.
I'm like... I'm like the lamb led to the slaughterhouse around here, that's what I feel like. Oh, my goodness.
 I was like, wow, J.T., Erinn and Taj and Stephen mounted a counterattack against Debbie to save me.
And it would have been very easy to vote me out. You know, I know I'm a dangerous player in this game,
and so I'm-I'm just shocked. Thanks for protecting me.  I mean, it was...  Holy cow!
So what's the lesson in this? I think that the game is still being played with truth. I think the game is still being
played with honesty. And I think this is the first time in this game that I'm almost speechless.
Almost.  Sorry to lay that one on you before bed.  Yeah.
 Now I just want to talk to J.T. and Stephen and just ask them when am I going? Just tell me when I'm going.
Because obviously, Coach Wade's no longer in control of this game, and I don't know what's going to happen next.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  My mind is blown. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK
TELEVISION (theme song playing)
 Yeah, man.  Yeah.
 I've got a question before I go off and cut down two...  Yeah.
 I just want to be in agreement with you guys on what you want to do.
 I know. Man, my lungs feel like--  Are you all right? You looked ruined yesterday.
 I feel like I scarred my lungs yesterday.
And my lungs feel like I smoked 20 cigars in a row yesterday and inhaled all of them. But, I mean, like, for me, it's
whatever you guys want. I was talking to the guys about Exile. And I don't want to go to Exile.
Nobody wants to go to Exile at this point. I just hope my asthma doesn't play up.
That's a horrible excuse. You know, that's my only fear. I'm just making it out here. This asthma is kicking my ass.
My back is killing me every day. So how do I handle that adversity?  So what do you think, Coach?
 You know what I think is the-the noble thing is that we send J.T. or myself. But the cold, calculating
competitor in me wants to send Taj or Erinn. It's really up to you guys what you think.
I just want to all be on the same page.  Oh, God! I mean, J.T. and I are eager to send Coach to
Exile. He has been so skittish about it. He has been selling out
everyone trying to get them to go to Exile before him. I mean, you know, Coach has mentioned ailments, you know, a
back problem, asthma, but it never seemed to really affect his performance. So I'm not entirely sure Coach
can build a fire and cook this food by himself. I don't know. I think he's scared.
Do you want to just tell him?  Huh?  You want to just tell him we're sending him to Exile?
 Doesn't matter. Coach, he's just really scared to go to Exile. Such an adventurous soul as
Coach shouldn't really be scared to go to Exile. So I'm ready to test him, and also we plan on sending
Coach home at the next Tribal Council, so it would be nice for him to come very weak to the next immunity challenge.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! What's up, final five?  Hi.  How you doing, Jeff?
 PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yes.  Yeah.
 PROBST: For today's challenge you will race through a maze. You must then build a pole long enough to retrieve a sandbag.
You'll swing the sandbag in an attempt to knock over three targets, raising a flag. First person to raise their
flag wins. One more element to this challenge-- you will run the entire challenge with your feet
shackled together. Want to know what you're playing for?  Yeah.
 PROBST: The winner of this challenge will be taken on an overnight reward. You will leave camp.
You will be taken to the governor's retreat, where you will enjoy a bed, a shower, a feast.
In addition, the winner will send one person to Exile Island. Worth playing for?  Yeah.
 PROBST: I know it is. We'll draw for spots, we'll get started.
Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go!
J.T. in the lead. Is he right? Everybody following J.T., except Taj.
She's going her own way. Somebody's going to be right, somebody's going to be wrong. Stephen hits a dead end.
 This is dumb!  PROBST: Taj hits a dead end. J.T.'s on the right course. Coach right behind.
Coach taking the smart strategy. He's just going to follow J.T., let him lead. Erinn going to follow Coach and
J.T. It's follow the leader.
J.T. and Coach through the second section of the maze. Erinn right in it. Taj and Stephen falling out of
it. J.T. having no trouble at all with this maze. Coach having no trouble
following him. J.T. and Coach entering the final section of the maze.
J.T. is through the maze. Coach right behind. Now you've got to start working on that pole.
 You guys, help me out here.  PROBST: Erinn, Stephen, Taj, now very far behind. Right now this challenge is
between J.T. and Coach.  Come on, J.T.  PROBST: Coach would love to win a reward.
 Damn right about that.  Back, back, back, back, back.  PROBST: J.T. already working on his pole.
Coach still untying his pieces. Taj through the maze. Erinn through the maze. Stephen through the maze.
Everybody's now working on their pole.
J.T. has a nice pole coming along. Coach picking up the pace. J.T. with a bit of a lead.
J.T. now has four pieces of pole together. Once you think your pole is long enough, reach for that
sandbag. J.T. has his pole together, and has reached for his bag. Coach needs to pick it up.
J.T. knocks over his first target.  Nice job.  PROBST: There are a total of
three targets you have to hit. J.T.'s knocked over his second target. One target left for a big
reward. Coach now in on it. Will his pole reach?
J.T. wins reward!  Whoo!  That was awesome.  All right!
(applause)
 PROBST: J.T., come on over. First order of business, sending one person to Exile island. They will not go on the reward.
They will not go back to camp. They will have another hot, probably wet stay away from all of the politics of what is
going on these last few days. Exile is the one place you do not want to be on Day 34.  Any volunteers?
Let's be noble, Coach.  Okay.  Let's do this.  Yep.
 Me and you's the only two that hasn't been, man.  You bet.  Thank you, J.T.
 PROBST: Coach, how do you feel about going to Exile?  I'm good. I'm going to take the monastic approach.
I'm not gonna build a fire, not gonna eat. I'm just gonna meditate.  He's going to take the martyr
approach, so when he comes back he can not have eaten, not have slept, not have had any water, to-- minimizing the experiences
of some, I feel like-- and have an excuse when he doesn't win immunity when he gets back.  That's pretty harsh.
 Kind of how I feel. Sorry.  PROBST: Is there something to what Erinn said about maybe trying to put yourself in the
position so that you've had the worst experience at Exile?  I want it to be tough on me, that's for sure.
I'm not going to minimize everybody's experience. In fact, I'm disappointed that Erinn would say that.
You know, since the beginning of the game she wanted to try to, uh, cut me down a little bit and a lot of
times when people do that it's to vault themselves over. I think maybe she wants to leave here with the toughest Exile
experience. And I don't want to take that away from her. As far as coming back and
winning immunity, my body is about this close right now from, uh, total disaster. I've got, uh, disks on the right
side that have ruptured. I feel my left one is about ready to slip. My asthma is choking me up so
bad I can't breathe. There's no excuse about if I win immunity or if I don't win immunity.
I make no excuses. So, you know, you can throw stones at me, you can, everybody else can and I go like this.
Give me your best shot. Hit me with your best shot, Pat Benatar, doesn't matter to me.  PROBST: All right, Coach,
grab your personal items. Head out. Coach will return in time for the next immunity challenge.
 I bit you guys  adieu.  Thank you, Coach.  PROBST: All right, J.T., let's get to the reward.
You're going to take one person with you, meaning you're going to leave two people behind. Maybe the best reward so far.
Who you taking with?  I gotta, I gotta take the only person that took me-- I guess Stephen.
 Thank you, J.T.  We'll be fine.  Ya'll don't hate me.  We'll be fine.
 We'll be great.  PROBST: Erinn, Taj, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.  Have fun!  PROBST: Head out, guys. Enjoy.
 Coach looked like he was going to go without a fight, but Erinn had to try to rub it in his face.
I mean, she's just shooting herself in the foot. People are so dumb in this game. I mean, they talk way too much.
So, it's going to hurt her and not me.
 It is quiet! Love it.  And it's a nice, sunny day.  Good, there will be no shade
for Coach.
J.T. won and took Stephen on reward, which is fine. The guys can go out and have a good time.
I'm not worried about it at all. I feel very confident in my alliance with Stephen and J.T. We vowed that we'd go to the
final three together, and we will.  Well, interesting day, if nothing else.
I'm feeling a little guilty.  Why?  About what I said. It was not an appropriate venue
to say that. Like, it's a conversation I probably should have had with him.
 No, no. He's a jerk. He's a jerk. To say, "I'm not going to eat." Give me a break.
You're sitting here suffering from asthma, a broken disk, this and that, and you're not going to eat?
 Why wouldn't you, like, try and make yourself feel better?  Oh, he's making me sick. I'm so ready to send his ass
home.  I know, me, too, but...  And you know what kills me? He's talking all this smack
about how he's so broken down, but he was perfectly fine when he was on J.T.'s heels. Had he won, the "warrior" would
have been back.  Oh, I know, I know. Yeah, I just, I don't understand the man.
I don't understand his motives. I would hate, hate, hate for anything that I said today to send me home before him.
 Don't worry yourself. Please don't worry.  Okay.  Do not worry.
 My strategy definitely is to go as far as I can with J.T. and Stephen. I would hate for anything I said
to have changed the way that Stephen and J.T. view me, but this is really the time where you do start to get really
paranoid about this stuff.
(bird screeches)  This is going to be like a vacation for me. A little sun tan out here...
All those wishy-washy people at camp with no character. Phew! Coach Wade's foundation is built on a rock.
Inside here... Unbreakable, unbending, unyielding, immeasurable, immovable, invincible.
Staying out here for a week without any food will only make me a better, stronger person.
Those guys won't be able to get old Coach Wade down, I'll tell you that. I will not have anything to eat.
It's going to be like the ancient American Indians that are my ancestors. They used to go out into the
wilderness for 48 hours and they would commune with the creator of the universe and they would become men.
Well, I'm already a man. So, this will just make me more of a man, but this is going to be an adventure.
Thank you for creating me as an individual. I ask that you would help me to forgive Erinn as she's back at
camp thinking negative thoughts about me. At the challenge, Erinn said, "Well, I think Coach is just
being a martyr." But I just let her have it. Dragon slayer makes his dragon cane.
Whether it's because I'm speaking such truth that nobody can deny it or because I'm so eloquent, whatever the case, I
got the last word. And I hope she goes home next. She's certainly going to get my vote.
Coach Wade's body might be failing him in many ways, but Coach Wade still has what it takes to outlast anybody out
here in this environment. Period, paragraph.
 Oh, man!  Oh, wow. This is how I like to travel.  When I woke up this morning,
I never would have imagined I'd be in a private plane.  Look at this. This is the freaking life.
 This was the best reward I could have possibly asked for. A private plane to, uh, the governor's retreat.
I just really soaked it up. That's always been a dream of mine, have a private plane and to be able to fly on one like
that, and it was really awesome.  Ha-ha! Whoo!
 Hey, we're getting low.
Good job, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, man!
 Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  Welcome to  Pousada Cantao,
the governor's retreat.  Oh, my gosh!  Oh, man, this is nice.  This is ridiculous.
 I mean, this place is just beautiful. You can tell there were some big parties thrown at this
place.  Here it is.  All right, thank you. Whoo!
 You're welcome.  We were taken to our room. Oh, my God, a bed, a shower.  Oh, wow!
Oh, my gosh! This is what I look like! Wow! That is a beard, all right. I think it'd look good with a
little trim.  Look at my hair, man.  When we stepped into the bathroom, we looked at
ourselves in the mirror and that was a shock. I mean, I haven't seen myself in over a month.
Oh, my God. My teeth are gross now.  I need to take a shower.  Shower, I know.
 Yeah. I was like, man, I've got to get a shower, get out of here. So, oh, man, it was like
heaven. Oh! Oh, man! I can't get enough of this soap.
34 days. I have not washed my nasty self. Oh!
 As soon as we were clean, we left our room and went for our feast.  What you're gonna have
tonight is authentic Brazilian churrasco.  Oh, yes!  It's a Brazilian barbecue
with many kinds of meat. Eat as much as you want.  Thank you so much.  See you later.
 Oh, wow! Oh, wow!  Yes! Feliz navidad.  Oh, wow!
Oh, my God! This meat is incredible.  Yeah.  Oh, my!
 Is there more?   Por favor.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.
We were having a meat festival. We had steaks, we had pork, we had a grilled pineapple. We were filling up and,
basically, by the time we were done with the meats, we were stuffed. (sighs)
 Well, buddy...  Cheers.  To the final two in this game.
 Final two. Ah.  I mean, we got this thing, man.
There's no reason why you and I aren't sitting in the final two.  Coach totally depends on us.  Coach is totally with us, and
I will take Coach to the final three.
 Today at the reward challenge, Erinn goes on a little bit of a rant about how "Well, Coach doesn't want to
have to perform in the next immunity challenge and he's giving himself excuses." There was no reason to sort
of rub salt in his wound. She can't really control what she says, which is not a great trait in a potential ally.
Erinn doing that, it kind of makes me want to keep her less. What is that going to do for her?
I mean, it's just not strategic.  You can never tell, man.  That's-That's when people get
screwed over.  And hopefully, she's going to get screwed over.
 My exile experience was no sleep, starving. No food. Very little water.
And it was friggin' awesome. It was a great experience to be out here and once again test myself and have nothing.
I've been in the Amazon, the Congo, the Oronoco, the Darien Gap... Chalk another one to the list.
The dunes at Exile. Yes, I'm walking slower. Yes, my asthma is still at the forefront of things.
Yes, it's going to take me longer to get to the challenge today. I do not feel tired.
I do not feel hungry. I feel nothing but incredible mental focus on the task at hand which I have to
accomplish today and that's winning immunity. Marcus Aurelius once said, "Through our greatest
adversities come our greatest successes." I plan on winning immunity today.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
We'll now bring in Coach, returning from Exile Island.
 Oh, my God. Coach.  What's up, fellas?  You look beat. Come on, bring it in.
 Ladies. I'm feeling great. I'm feeling great.  When Coach returned from Exile with his cane and he's
limping and I'm thinking, "This guy is such a drama queen. He's so dramatic." Any 37-year-old man who thinks
he's a dragon slayer belongs in a mental institution. They need to come get him. When we have Tribal Council,
he'll be free and they can take him home.  PROBST: How did it go down?  I was freezing, I didn't get
any sleep, I didn't have any water, no food, no fire. I had the best time of my life. It was euphoric.
 PROBST: All right. You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Definitely.
 PROBST: First things first. Stephen, take back the immunity necklace.  Hey, can I get some water?
 PROBST: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to use your arms to brace
yourself between two walls while your feet are positioned on very narrow footholds. Every 15 minutes, you'll move
to an even smaller foothold, and you'll be doing this barefoot. When you reach the third and
final foothold, you will stay there for as long as you can. When you fall off, you're out. Last person left standing wins
immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-four shot of winning this game. Losers, Tribal Council,
somebody going home. We'll take our spots. We'll get started. Here we go.
All right, everybody's got their arms inside the frame. Their feet on the first peg. This challenge is underway.
You cannot use your butt, your back, or your hips to lean against the wall to give you support.
This is where mental toughness is going to win out.
All right, we're going to get ready to move to the next smaller foothold. I'm going to count you into
this. Five, four, three, two, one. Take your time. Get yourself settled.
Everybody's looking good.
Coach, you think the time you spent on Exile meditating may have conveniently prepared you for a challenge like this?
 Deep down inside the pit of every man's stomach is a feeling that he's no longer going to be invincible.
So, for me to go out there and to put myself in the most extreme situation that I could, I did it because I wanted for
my mind to once and for all tell my body that you still have it.  PROBST: Perfect opportunity
to put that philosophy to the test in this challenge. Because this is about mind over matter.
And it will get difficult.
All right, we're going to now move to the final foothold. Five, four, three, two, one.
Erinn drops out before getting on the final foothold. Erinn will take a spot on the bench.
No shot at immunity, vulnerable at Tribal Council tonight. There's no time limit now. This goes until only one
person's left standing. There's no way to prepare for a challenge like this physically. This is all in your head.
Stephen drops out. Take a spot on the bench.
Taj digging in. Taj cannot hang on any longer. Taj is out of the challenge. We are down to two.
J.T. and Coach. The listener and the talker. The young buck, the older warrior, battling it out for a
guaranteed spot in the final four.
 Got any food, Jeff?  PROBST: If I wheeled out a big old steak and a six-pack, you'd step down?
 Probably so, Jeff.  Well, then you might as well step down, unless you're trying to vote me off tonight.
 I can't believe you don't trust me, Coach.  I do trust you. I trust you implicitly, J.T.
You know that.  Good.  You are a man of your word. Few and far are those left in
this world.  PROBST: This is just how you want it, isn't it, Coach? Battle against the best.
You've been talking about it for 36 days. You're getting it today.
Been up there 50 minutes now. You're going to have to fight the pain. Your feet will recover.
No way to recover if you're voted out.
 You ain't going to let me try the necklace on, are you, Coach?  Nope.
 I don't blame you.  I got something to prove coming back from Exile.
(screams)
 PROBST: Coach steps down.  That's all right.  PROBST: J.T. has won individual immunity.
 Oh, my God, man. Geez, are you okay, man? You did awesome.  Be hard-headed.
Get up. Come on.  Are you okay?  My back was... my back was spasming up there.
 Can you stand up now, though?  Oh, man. You did an incredible...  Come on, stand up.
 You don't have to stand up if you can't yet.  PROBST: Where are you feeling it?
 My back spasmed while I was up there the last ten minutes.  Oh, my God, man.  I felt something go.
I tried. I couldn't do it.  PROBST: You going to want medical to look at that?  Nope, nobody is taking me
out of the game right now. If medical would really look at my back, I wouldn't be here, so, no, please don't have them look
at my back.
 PROBST: J.T., congratulations. (applause) J.T. is safe at tonight's Tribal
Council. Coach, Stephen, Taj, Erinn, one of the four of you going home after 36 long days out here.
Grab your stuff and head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.  Could have gone a lot longer,
huh?  Yeah.  I figured that.  It looked like Coach had
really been suffering. You know, he looked like Exile had really been tough. You know, I definitely felt bad
for the guy. But, you know, Coach is still the dragon slayer and a really strong competitor.
If I want to win this game, I want people I can beat in the finals.
(thunder rumbles)  Well, congratulations.  Nice job.  You all right, Coach? Huh?
 Coach was really ridiculous today. I mean, he walks in like he can barely move, and then he's
standing up on these things for, like, near an hour.
 He's an interesting man, right there.
 Yeah.  He's so full of it.  I know. He's been walking around since
we've been back, like, you're not as broken down as you're trying to make yourself look. And, really, like, I'm ready
for him to go home. And the other thing, too, when Jeff asked him if he wanted medical to look at him.
 Yeah.  No, you don't want them to look at it because they're going to tell you there's nothing
wrong with you.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.  He needed an excuse for not
winning.
 That was a classic struggle today, man. How much longer could you have gone?
 Probably 30 minutes.  As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. Our ancestors would hope and
pray for somebody worthy in battle to defeat them, and I think that that definitely played out today with J.T. and
myself. I was honored by the defeat and the way that I went down.  Stephen and I are leaning
towards Erinn.
I know Erinn is going to vote for you. Taj may-- you may get two votes. But Stephen and I and you
vote Erinn, she's gone.  J.T. reassures me, tells me, hey, everything's cool, man. Don't worry-- Erinn needs to go
tonight because of the comment that she made the other day. It was unforgivable. It's just her time to go.
It's been her time to go for a while. I mean, sending me to Exile, supposedly, mentally, I'm
supposed to be down, so she's trying to kick me while I'm on the ground.  Oh, yeah, that's it.
That's all she's doing.  And you know, a lot of my bravado is just 'cause I'm trying to tell myself, hey,
you're still kind of the man.  Guys.  Hey, come on down.
 So you really want to send Erinn home tonight?  I was really pissed off. When she went to Exile we were
all, like, patting her on the back. We weren't trying to kick her, because, you know, I mean--
I just thought it was, like, so tasteless and classless. J.T. and I sat down with Coach and we reassured him that
the warrior alliance was good. Erinn was going home tonight. And J.T. is going to vote for Erinn because he feels like he
promised Coach that he would. But I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't... I mean, it's really
tricky right now.  She tried to call me out in the very beginning, and I was like, those are the kind of
people that get their ass voted out.  Right, because no one trusts them.
 Brendan did it. Tyson started getting sketchy.  Well, Erinn belongs right beside them.
 And you're totally cool with that? I mean, I'm just asking, right? I mean, there's not going to be
any surprises tonight, right?  No.  I'm done with the surprises at Tribal, man.
The warrior alliance is still going strong. I surrounded myself with strong players, and to this date, it
has not backfired on me. It looks like through all the blindsides, Coach Wade will be the last tribe member left of
what used to be Timbira. I am the last of the Mohicans.  PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, and Debbie, voted out at the last Tribal Council.
So, Coach let's start with your stay on Exile Island. When J.T. picked you to go to Exile, you made your big thing,
about, "I'm going to do this the hard way." Erinn, you didn't like that.  I didn't.
Like, he's weak and he's this and he's that and then to go off and not eat or drink for three days, that just really rubbed
me the wrong way, and it just minimized the entire experience that the rest of us were having.  PROBST: Was there a part of
you that had just come off one of the roughest stays on Exile, feeling a little bit like you're going to upstage me with your
dramatic exile?  Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Like, the time that I spent out there sucked.
It was the worst thing I've ever done. I never want to do it again. And you're standing there
going, "Oh, I totally want to do that; that sounds awesome." Like, that sucks.  PROBST: Coach, you respect
what Erinn's saying?  I think that everybody here that's been to Exile had a much tougher time than me.
But I had past experiences with which to draw on. Which made it easier for me, and, you know, a lot of times,
men drop what they think is a pebble, but women see a boulder dropping and crashing, an overwhelming sense of judgment.
I certainly wasn't trying to minimize her experience or anybody else's for that matter. So there's really nothing else
to say, you know. Mark Twain-- "Better for people to think you're a fool than to open your mouth and remove
all doubt." I've already done that. I really don't have any place to go now.
 PROBST: Erinn, you feel pretty secure about your alliance?  I never feel secure, ever.
 PROBST: Do you think the person going home tonight may know it's coming, or is this going to be a shock?
 For the most part, someone will be surprised, yes.  PROBST: Coach, you think it's going to be a surprise tonight?
 No.  PROBST: Based on what?  Women have great intuition.  PROBST: So you're saying it's
already been said tonight if we listened?  Yes.  PROBST: All right, it is
time to get to the vote.  One more thing.  PROBST: Yes?  I wrote a poem for everybody
to hear. With friend and foe we march to the battle plane Some to seek success,
others to seek fame We play with honor for the love of this game And with armor or without,
we will toil in vain So that someday, someone, somewhere will remember our name.
 PROBST: Can't think of a better way to lead us into the vote. J.T., you keeping that idol?
 Yes, sir.  PROBST: You cannot vote for J.T. Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote. J.T., you're up.
 Dragon slayed.
 You've been like the cat that had nine lives in this game. Good job staying in the game
this long, kid.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, tonight is the last night you can do so.
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
First vote, Coach.
Erinn. One vote Coach, one vote Erinn.
Erinn. Two votes Erinn, one vote Coach.
Coach. We're tied. Two votes Coach, two votes Erinn, one vote left.
12th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury...
Coach. You need to bring me your torch.
 It was an honor, guys. Thank you.
 PROBST: Coach, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
 PROBST: Well, it's clear based on the number of blindsides at Tribal Council, this is going to be a really fun
finish. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
 J.T. ended up voting with Coach for strategic reasons.  PROBST: J.T. and Stephen turn on each other.
