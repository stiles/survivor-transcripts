♪ ♪  JEFF PROBST: Brazil's Tocantins...
...a hot and merciless terrain.
With the crystal waters of the Rio Novo providing a source of life and hidden danger.
36 days ago, 16 strangers were thrust into this unforgiving environment. Welcome to  Survivor: Tocantins.
Your time starts now 'cause this game is on. Jalapao and Timbira... Jalapao wins immunity!
...went blow for blow in challenges. Timbira wins immunity! (cheering)
 Right now, the momentum's like this.  PROBST: Jalapao wins immunity!
Timbira wins immunity! But the real game was back at camp. J.T., Stephen, and Taj...
 Everybody give me their hands.  PROBST: ...formed the Jalapao three.
 Taj just put herself, me and Stephen in a really tight alliance.  PROBST: While at an early
Timbira Tribal Council...  I love to be the leader. That's what I'm used to doing.  PROBST: ...Coach fought for
control of his tribe.  It's a role that Coach is used to, but it's something that Brendan does better.
 For her to be so quick to say that, I think comes more to a personality clash.  PROBST: And Erinn, a
perpetual outsider...  I want to get Erinn out immediately.  PROBST: ...struggled to stay
in the game.  I have to turn "girl that maybe is kind of on the outs a little bit" into the opposite of
that, because now I feel like I'm kind of fighting for my life a little bit.  PROBST: Timbira wins
immunity! Timbira took the lead in challenges. After the merge, Timbira was six
strong against the Jalapao three: Taj, Stephen and J.T..  Traditionally, if you're outnumbered going into a merge,
you're sitting ducks.  What will today bring?  PROBST: But with Coach and Brendan locked in a power
struggle...  When it comes head-to-head, we'll see who really was the chosen one.
 PROBST: And Erinn still on the outs...  Like you guys-- why not make my own tribe?
 PROBST: The Jalapao three saw an opportunity to divide and conquer.  Erinn's vote will be huge.
Taj, myself, Stephen and Erinn could easily turn the game around.  PROBST: They convinced Erinn
to turn on her former Timbira tribe mates and wipe them from the game in a devastating series of blindsides.
The tribe has spoken. Until only Coach remained.  Dragon slayer makes his dragon cane.
 PROBST: He was ready for a fight. But it turned out to be his last stand.
12th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury. He received every vote except J.T.'s.
The tribe has spoken. Now only four remain. Erinn.  I will lie and cheat and stab
you in the back. I didn't come out here so that my friends and family at home could really respect me.
I came out here because I want to go home with a million bucks.  PROBST: Stephen.  I think my story is a little
bit of a David and Goliath story. I'm not the physical competitor in challenges.
I am not the guy who's at ease in the wild, and for me to be sitting really close right now to a million dollars, you know,
I think speaks a lot for me.  PROBST: Taj.  In this game, I'm trying to stay under the radar, have
everyone believe that I'm this simple person. If I have to smile in your face and stab you in the back, I'm
sorry, that's the name of the game. I'm going to do it.  PROBST: J.T..
 I'm not a stupid country boy. I'm the hardest worker out here. I get things done.
I fish, work and I battle it out in the physical challenges, and I come back and I start the social game.
I'm an all-around competitor in this game. It was made for me.  PROBST: Find out tonight who
will be the sole survivor.
 All right, kids.  Final four.  Whoo-hoo!  Exciting stuff.
 And four in one shot at a million dollars.  Mm-hmm.  True.
 Say it louder.  Here's to the final four, guys.  High five.
 We-we are the final four.  We just had Tribal Council tonight and Coach went home. Coach made me promise him that
I was voting Erinn, and I-- and I did. I voted Erinn tonight with Coach.
It was tough to see him go, but we're down to the final four now, so everything's going as planned.
I'm just starting to get a little worried about jury votes.  That was a hard vote, man. After all those nice things
Coach said about me, it was not easy to vote against him.  It got you a lot of jury votes.
 No way, man, after they saw me betray him.  No, they don't know.  Plus-plus-- oh yeah, right,
they don't know who betrayed him.  I don't know.  You was the one smiling
like...  Me?  J.T. ended up voting with Coach, I think for both personal
and strategic reasons. You know, then J.T. comes off looking like the loyal ally, whereas I'm the guy who
backstabbed coach. You know, ultimately, I think it'll hurt me. You definitely got his vote
tonight, friend. You know, I-I think I probably will come off as a villain and you're going to profit from it.
 Either way, it's done.  I'm, obviously, very loyal to J.T., but I'm also loyal to myself and my own odds of
winning a million dollars, so I need to think about who do I want to be there at the end with?
Who I can beat at the end? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION

♪ ♪  Day 37.  Day 37.  Mm-hmm.
 It's hard to believe that I'm still here, final four. There's a huge feeling of accomplishment, especially for
me, Stephen and Taj, the remaining three Jalapao are here in the final four together.  You guys want to check if we
got any tree mail?
We were supposed to be gone a long time ago and to come over here outnumbered and now be three to one, and our entire
jury is Timbira, I mean, it's a masterpiece.
 Can't discount anybody in the final four.
Our biggest threat, of course, is J., but...  I know. Well, you know, if J.T. loses
immunity, dot, dot, dot.  Wow.  I don't know.  Dot, dot, dot.
 I don't think I can do that, but...  I-I couldn't do that, either.  But, you know, better him
than me.  Oh.  Tree mail!
 Tree mail-- oh!  Oh!  Oh, no! This could be ugly.
 Oh, no!  This could be ugly.  I am the last Timbira standing, which means that I'm
with three of the original Jalapao members, people who have been together since day one. And they've really become like
best friends out here.  Look at this thing.  What?  What in the hell is that?
 Spi-spider?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's nasty.  "Hope you're not
arachnophobic. Do huge spiders make you worry? If you get spun out with the web, you could get stuck in the
jury."  Oh, man.  "Spun out with the web."  I would definitely like to
win immunity today. Um, otherwise, it could very well be me going home.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
 Ooh!
 PROBST: Welcome, final four. Congratulations. Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
 Yeah.  PROBST: First things first, J.T., take back the immunity necklace.
Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race through a
tarantula-shaped obstacle course to three different stations, then retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces from each one.
Once y bags, you'll use those puzzle pieces to solve a web-shaped puzzle.
First person to get it right wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-three shot of winning this game.
Lose this challenge, you are guaranteed a one-in-three shot of going home. Big stakes.
You guys ready to get started?  Yeah.  PROBST: Let's do it.
Here we go, for immunity, and a guaranteed spot in the final three. Survivors, ready?
Go!
Big falls right off the bat. J.T. and Taj going up the same leg of the tarantula. Even though there are many to
choose from.
J.T. flying through it and out the other side. Stephen really taking his time. Erinn taking her time.
J.T. has his first bag. He's heading back.
J.T. now flying back the other way. Erinn working on her first bag. Stephen at his first bag, Taj
at her first bag.
J.T. heading out for bag number two. That rope will tear you up.
Going to lose some skin in this challenge. J.T. at his second bag. Nobody else even back with
their first bag yet.
Taj back with her first bag. Stephen back with his first bag.
Erinn now back with her first bag. J.T. back with his second bag. J.T. has one bag left, only one
bag left for J.T.
Going to be a showdown-- J.T. heading one way, Taj heading the other. Stephen back with his second
bag.  Lie down flat.  Come through there, hurry.  PROBST: J.T. going over Taj.
Erinn back with her second bag. Taj is out with her second bag. J.T. is through with his final bag.
J.T., start working on the puzzle. Stephen heading back with his final bag.
Erinn and Taj both have one bag left. J.T. already working on that puzzle.
It is a difficult puzzle. You would expect nothing less on day 37. Stephen out with his third and
final bag. Start working on the puzzle, Stephen. Erinn and Taj both working on
that final bag. Puzzle takes a long time. Don't give up, Taj, don't give up, Erinn.
This is big-time immunity. You do not want to go to Tribal Council tonight without immunity.
Taj through with her third bag. Erinn through with her third bag.
J.T. has had a nice head start. Stephen's had a pretty good amount of time. Erinn is the last to get here.
There will be one piece in the center, then two pieces in the second row, three pieces in the third row, always.
Stephen proved earlier he is a wiz with numbers. Does that hold true for puzzles?
J.T. getting closer. Only five pieces left for J.T. if he has them in the right spot.
Erinn making up a lot of ground now. Erinn was the last person to start working on her puzzle.
Taj starting to fall behind now. Stephen still fighting to stay in this. Right now, it is between J.T.,
Stephen and Erinn.
J.T. down to one piece left, but he can't find a spot for it. He's got one in the wrong spot. Erinn has closed the gap now.
It is Erinn and J.T. (J.T. groans)
 Yes.  PROBST: J.T. wins immunity! (Stephen groans)  I am so close.
All right, J. Oh, man.  PROBST: J.T., once again, back-to-back.
Nice job.  Whoo-hoo!  PROBST: Once again, J.T. is safe at Tribal Council.
Tonight, Erinn, Stephen, Taj, it's been 37 days. That will be all it is for one of you.
Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at Tribal.  I had it.
I got my last pieces out, ready to put them into the very, very last one. J.T. won immunity.
Frustrating to no end. I am sitting next to three people who have been together since day one, and I am very
aware that they could just take me out and keep Taj.
 Congratulations.  Thanks.  Nice job.  Work well done.
 It was a close one.  It was a close one.  Well, J.T. wins immunity today.
Any one of the Jalapao members, had they won, it would have worked in our favor, and the plan is to vote for Erinn
because Jalapao is Jalapao the three, and as long as we stay loyal, we can go to the final three together.
 Let's get in that water.  I'm not getting in the water. It's going to burn so bad. Erinn, I'm sure she's vying for
a spot. She's gonna be trying to convince them that she's worthy of being here.
But I want her to realize that she can try all day long. The guys are loyal to me until the final three, and, and we got
to move on like that.  I got to ease in before I-- well, actually, coming over and sitting down would be the same
as easing in. You know how I don't like to do it all at once. Coming back from the challenge,
all I'm thinking about is, like, what's my next move? How am I going to plead my case? What do I do, what do I say?
I don't want to make it seem as though I'm scrambling. I'm just going to say my piece. I think Taj-- she has played
such a good social game. Like, she has made really good friends with everyone, and I mean, she definitely played a
great game, aside from just, like, being very likable.  Uh-huh.  And I totally think she could
win.  Erinn's really playing her game down at the water, and she made a good point.
Taj has a very good chance of beating me when the jury votes 'cause everyone loves Taj.  Ay, ay, ay.
 This is a game for a million dollars. Right now, it doesn't matter who's Timbira, who's Jalapao.
I want to make sure I've got a good shot at a million dollars.
How do we do this? Tonight's the last hard vote.  Erinn, we can beat for sure in the final immunity.
Then we're basically guaranteed the final two.
All right, good.  We're taking each other no matter what.  No matter what.
J.T. and I are sort of trying to figure out if we'd rather go to the final three with Taj or with Erinn.
If I betray Taj, you know, I definitely won't look good in the jury's eyes. But how do I get to the finals
and how do I win them? That's been really guiding all of my decisions. I think Taj is getting
suspicious.  Yeah.  If we vote off Erinn tonight, then it will be Taj, me and
J.T. in the next immunity challenge. I think Taj has a stronger chance than Erinn would in that
challenge, and I think there's also a very good chance that Taj would take J.T. to the final two.
Maybe she thinks, "I'm gonna take this kid from rural Alabama rather than the New York City boy."
So it's a really difficult decision on both strategic and moral and personal grounds.  Yeah, that's who we're going
for?  Yeah.  Definitely?  Who else?
 I just want to make sure. You never know.  Y'all can't go for me.  No, I would never...
 Thank God.  Oh, so that means you and Erinn are going to vote for me. Um... hello?
 Huh?  You're not voting for me?  No, no, I was making sure y'all wasn't voting for me.
 Tonight is a very hard Tribal Council. Taj, myself and Stephen-- we are the tightest three in this
game, no doubt about it, and so we're definitely reassuring Taj that Erinn's going home, and Erinn may be going home.
We're not sure what we're going to do tonight, but Stephen and I are going to stick together on whatever decision we make.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Debbie, and Coach, voted out at the last Tribal Council.
Stephen, going back to the merge, it was six Timbira members, three Jalapao. Here we are tonight.
Five of the six Timbira are on the jury. How did this happen?  Um, basically, we sort of had
a game plan, you know. We each kind of selected a few members of Timbira who we thought we might connect with
and I think that's really helped us. I think what was the most important thing was just we
would always stick together.  PROBST: Erinn, you are the lone remaining Timbira member. All of your former tribemates
make up the jury.  That's true. I mean, I'm, like, pretty proud of myself, not, like, in a
vengeful way, but, like, it speaks greatly of my self- perseverance, and I definitely made decisions that kept me
here, and that is amazing to me.  PROBST: So, Erinn, when you guys get back from the challenge, is it scramble time
for you?  Um, one thing that I have learned watching everyone go out before me is that scrambling
does not work.  PROBST: So, if history holds true to form, the final Timbira member-- you-- will join the
jury, and the Jalapao three will battle it out to see who goes to the end.  Absolutely.
These three really have been working together since day one or two of this game. I wouldn't be surprised if they
continued to do so.  PROBST: Taj, how big a risk would it be to let Erinn have a shot of going to the end when
all of her former tribemates are on the jury?  Well, that might be a plus for her because we are the three
Jalapao members that came in and put all of the Timbira members on the jury. They may not want to vote for
one of us, so she might get the votes just to be vindictive. So it could be pretty dangerous.  PROBST: It seems like that
the safest bet, Stephen, is to have the Jalapao three go to the end because then, at least we're all even.
 I mean, there's definitely that to consider. I also think it's an individual game, and you have to consider
everyone in the eyes of the jury, you know, and so you also have to think, like, "Who do I measure up against best?"
 PROBST: Does that mean, then, that, now that Coach is out, this whole philosophy of "take the best to the end" is gone?
 I mean, look, I respected Coach's philosophy and I always wanted to be there with the best, but obviously, I have
formed real bonds with everybody here. And so, you know, I almost hope I'm not in the position to make
that... that decision.  PROBST: Well, but you are. You have a vote. I almost feel as though, as the
thunder continues to crackle around us, it's almost like you just showed up and this is your first day here, and you... you
don't even know how the game is played. You can only vote for Erinn or Taj, so which is it?
 Okay. (sighs) I guess, for me, you know, the vote tonight is about: how do I
better assure myself a place in the finals?  PROBST: J.T., you've come a long way together.
Trust these other three?  Yeah, I obviously trust Stephen and Taj more so than Erinn, because I've spent a lot
more time with them. And they've made promises that have been kept. I've come to trust Erinn, but
not near as much as I trust the other two.  PROBST: Taj.  I agree.
From day one, J.T. and Stephen have been by my side, so I have no reason to distrust them. And Erinn, I-I think she's a
great girl and I-I believe in her, but I haven't been around her long enough to put my complete faith in her.
 PROBST: Would you be a little shocked if it was you tonight?  Oh, it... yeah, I would be very shocked if it was me
tonight. I would be very shocked. But everyone has a plan, and-and everyone's trying to win a
million dollars, so there's... there's no rules.  PROBST: Erinn, let's flip it. If, at the end of tonight's
vote, you, the only remaining Timbira member, are still here, you going to be shocked?  Surprised.
I wouldn't say "shocked," because anything can happen, but I would definitely be surprised if I didn't go home tonight.
 PROBST: So, what odds do you give yourself as we go into this vote?  Well... I'm going to give
myself a 33% chance of sticking around.  PROBST: So, the real question is: Will the Jalapao three
remain strong and vote out Erinn, or is somebody about to be shocked? Let's get to the vote.
J.T., you have the necklace. I assume you're keeping it.  Yes, I am.  PROBST: Cannot vote for J.T.
Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Erinn, you're up.
 You've played a great game. Hope to see you on the other side.
 It had to be you or me.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes. (thunder crashing)
Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately. I'll read the votes.
First vote. Taj.
Erinn. One vote Taj, one vote Erinn.
Taj. Two votes Taj, one vote Erinn.
13th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury. Taj. Need to bring me your torch.
Taj, your tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.
Congratulations. You've made it to the final three. Tomorrow, you will compete in
your final immunity challenge. Try to get a good night's sleep. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
Good night.
 Um, it's day 37. I got blindsided by my Jalapao members that have been looking out for me from day one.
And for them to, uh, blindside me, it blew my mind, so it's going to be really hard to choose who's worthy of a million
dollars. But, either way, if Erinn finds a way to weasel herself into the end, she got my vote.
 PROBST: Coming up next:  He's going to fight like hell to win.  We, too, must fight like
hell.  PROBST: Erinn pits Stephen and J.T. against each other.  Been a lot of talk about how
it would be suicide to go up against you.  That what Stephen said?  I have a good shot at going
to the end. If the two of them are both willing to take me, it puts me in a good spot.
 PROBST: Find out tonight who will claim the million dollar prize.
 Final three. Final three fever.  Crazy, crazy.
 Yeah.  Tonight's Tribal Council was probably the toughest yet. I really did not want to vote
Taj off tonight, but we made a decision based upon how easy it would be to win at the next challenge, and we had to get rid
of Taj.  Okay, so every single Tribal Council since the merge has gone exactly like we had planned for
it to. That is crazy. I really felt like she knew and she was kind of continuing to go
with it. But she didn't seem upset at all when it happened, and she didn't seem surprised.
 I'm already suffering the consequences, because Erinn is the most annoying person I know in the world, and she will not
shut up.  It didn't even, like, seem all that crazy to me until he said, "Tomorrow will be your
final immunity challenge."  Don't feel too bad, buddy.  I know, man.  This is a celebratory time.
We're the final three.
 It's great to be in the top three. I mean, it's a great milestone for us, but it's sort of... you
know, it's definitely tainted by the fact that we voted out Taj, and that hurts, and also just Erinn chattering away, and
that's annoying and, you know, totally ignorant of any... any sort of emotional turmoil that J.T. and I are going through.
 We're pretty awesome, guys. Final three is, like, the thing that you play for.  But, right now, you have to
think about how you're going to get to the finals. You can't make a strategic decision based on sort of the
emotional niceness of it.  Well, uh...
 Day 38. Oh, my God.  We just ate so early.  Yeah.
 No, not at all.  Okay.  Not at all. Absolutely.
We have our last immunity challenge today. I already have my decision made if I win.
I'm taking Stephen with me. It's the choice that's going to give me the best chance of winning.
Yeah, I agree.  I do trust you, but I trust me more. (Erinn chuckling)
 I also agree. Even if I don't win immunity today, I have a good shot at going to the end.
Neither of these guys want to go up against each other. I mean, we're all in positions where we could definitely win
this thing, but if the two of them don't want to fight it out with each other and they are both willing to take me, it puts
me in a good spot. He's going to fight like hell to win today.  I know he is.
We, too, must fight like hell.  Yeah.  We have to win.  Yeah.
 I mean, we stand a chance against each other, but I don't think either of us stand a chance against him in the
finals, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm a little afraid of winning today's immunity
challenge, because then I'll have a really difficult choice ahead of me. Um, take J.T., who has been my
comrade in arms, my closest friend, my ally and my fellow strategist since the very beginning of this game.
Or take Erinn with me, who I think I have a better shot against in the final two.
 All right. I just wanted to make sure we had an official agreement before we went in this challenge.
I'm sitting in a good spot to go to the final two, but can't help being worried sick, man. I'm... I'm worried.
There's no way she's going to beat both of us.  I don't think so.  You never can tell.
If Erinn was to win this challenge, I know I'm not going to the final two. And, uh, you know, I'd like to
think Stephen will hold up his end of the deal just as well as I will, but you never know. This is huge, man.
 Yep.
 I'm... I'm taking you to the final two, Stephen, if I win. There's no doubt about it, man. No doubt about it.
 Me, too.  Okay.  What a funny pair we are, you know.
 I know. I'm sure you could trust Stephen with anything in everyday life, as you could with me, but with a
million dollars in a game that you know you're here to lie to win, it's a different story. So, I've got one thing in mind.
That's winning this challenge. (hoots) This is day 38. Who would've ever thought that
I'd be standing here?  I know it.  I know. I love that it's the three of
us.  I love that it's me and two other people.  Yeah.
 Yeah, me, too.  Let's see what we got here.  We've got tree mail?  We got tree mail.
We can just open it here.  We can.  Awesome.  "Follow the map across the
river. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect
a representative idol of those who were voted out before you. At the end of your journey, you will burn them and pay your
respects, as they each had a part in getting you to this point. You will then proceed to your
final immunity challenge."  All right! (applause)  The rites of passage is sort
of a narrative of our adventure. Just every step along the way, the people we've had to face, the dragons we've had to slay,
to coin a phrase.  Wonder if I can just keep this. (Erinn laughs)
 Heavy is the head that wears the necklace. I think this is mostly going to be about just paying respect to
the people who fell along the way. I do think we owe it to them to kind of show that they matter to
us, that we valued them as people, and as enemy combatants on the field of  Survivor  battle. Carolina.
 Sweet Carolina.  So much trouble in such a little body. (Erinn laughs)
 A part of me has to be okay with the fact that I was the first voted out. But it hurt so bad to be sent
home so early, especially to be blindsided. However, I learned that maybe I should be a little bit more
patient sometimes, and I should just sit back and allow things to just happen and not always feel the need to try to control
things.
 Oh, Candace!  Yes.  I may have been her only friend in this game.
But, gosh darn it, I liked her a lot.  There's a part of me that's just, like, "Gosh, Candace, why
couldn't you tolerate the egocentric, sexist crap that was coming out of Coach's mouth? Like, why couldn't you play
along?" But it was just too much for me. This whole social compatibility crap-- it was my downfall.
 Jerry. If you could pick your own dad, you would totally pick Jerry to be your dad.
He was cool.  The worst time in this game for me was the day I got voted off.
Man, I was feeling so bad. I mean, I was hurting. I had been hurting for days, and I didn't want nobody to know
about it. I was hiding it. I mean, I had been in the reserves for, like, 26 years
now, and we have some tough training, but, boy,  Survivor,  by far was the toughest. (Jerry laughs)
 Sandy.  She was an excellent woman. She was definitely a bit crazy.  She definitely provided me
with one of the more humbling moments of my lifetime, as well.  I don't believe I could have played this game any harder than
I did. I was able to overcome the first impression with my tribe. The tribe did a complete flop.
I think I entertained them enough that, you know, they... I made them laugh, so I kind of...
You know, I drew them in, and they saw the strength come out, so I'm pretty proud of myself.
 Spencer.  He knew the game probably better than anybody I know.  He was a super fan and a very
strong strategist.  I feel very honored that I am the youngest contestant ever on  Survivor,  but I think my age
might have also had something to do with the game and the fact that I got voted out fifth. I tended to trust more people
than my older tribe mates would have done. I wanted to see the good in people, and in a game like this,
you really... you have to check that at the door. But not only did I play the game of  Survivor.
I was the first-ever teenager to play the game, and that's pretty cool.
 Sydney?  What a beautiful girl.  A wonderful lady.  That was one of the first
hard votes we had to make, Stephen. She was a... She was a tough one.
It was between her and Taj.  A big revelation for me, I think, was maybe I shouldn't have ridden some coattails.
I should have been making those moves myself. I don't need protection from other people.
Like, if I feel something, then why don't I just do it? I need to be more, I guess, self-assured, and that's
something I learned for sure.
 Joe.  Oh, Joe.  Captain America. The most decent guy out here.
Medically evacuated. That is not the way anybody wants to go.  Literally, I was just
getting started, but my body failed me. The main lesson I learned is that just generally speaking,
like, Mother Nature is a pretty awesome force. I think I'm tough enough to win this game, but I injured my
knee, and it took me down.
 Brendan. The first dragon to be slain in the Forza tribe.  He was a good player.
A good athlete, too.  Too true.  Just because you have been successful in business doesn't
necessarily translate to the Survivor  experience. You know, you come into it. I was, like, "Oh, I can win this
thing." But it's a lot harder than it looks. It's a humbling experience, and
I have a lot more respect for it now that I got my ass beat by it.
 Tyson.  Your buddy, Tyson.  Funny guy, really kind, really sincere guy, and taking
him out was, like, the turning point in the game for us, I think.  Yeah.
 I think the blindside, actually, for most people comes when they're the most confident, and I was definitely
overconfident. I was, like, "I've got this game wrapped up." But it's usually not the
strongest person that wins. The more pathetic you look and act usually seems to get you pretty far in the game.
So, those people can have their money. I'll keep my awesome personality and, uh, fantastic good looks.
 Sierra.  Sierra. Sweet Sierra. She was surprisingly honest and
just a really sweet girl. I mean...  Yeah.  It was great getting to know
her.  I would sum up my  Survivor experience as trial and tribulation.
(Sierra laughs) It was highs and lows throughout the whole entire game for me. I wore my heart on my sleeve.
I stayed true to who I was. I did everything I could but give up, and I was really happy about that.
It was the hardest and most amazing thing I've ever done in my life. And it will forever change who
I am as a person.
 Debbie.  Little Debbie.  Little Debbie.  Debbie was easily the person
that I was closest to out here. Um, it was the hardest vote for sure.  She was a super strong
player.  Yeah.  Always up in the top in the immunity challenges, extremely
strategic, really kind. I mean, she was one of the biggest threats in the game.  Sorry you had to go, Debbie.
 As a middle school principal, I deal with all different kinds of people every single day. So I really thought this game
was going to be something that I would get in here, figure everybody out. Um, unfortunately, I've also
learned that I maybe am not as great at figuring people out as I thought. But there's not many things that
can be thrown at me in life anymore that I won't know that I can't handle.
 Coach.  My most satisfying blindside to date.  Probably one of the most
honest people I know, and definitely, definitely set out to change the game.  He did change the game, you
know, in his own way.  Yeah.  He got final five with never telling a lie and being purely
honest. And, you know, what a great storyteller, too.  Yeah, absolutely.
 He was awesome. Yeah, I got a lot of respect for Coach.  Nietzsche once said, "There
is always some madness in love, but there's always some reason in madness." And I think that even as crazy
as the game was, and as crazy it was that I got blindsided, I can think of no finer way to go out than a man who has fought in
battle. I go back to the Vikings and the Indians and the samurai. You look at how they died, and
how did I leave? Head held high in the end, not defeated, not broken. And hopefully, like a Greek
tragedy, in death, I will give other people a rebirth of ideas.
 Taj. That was without a doubt the hardest vote so far this game. She's an incredibly strong
woman, very fierce in competitions.  Definitely.  Loving at camp.
You know, what else can you ask for?  And so fun.  Yeah.
 Taj will be a friend of mine for the rest of my life. Sure, no doubt.  Absolutely.
 This experience is going to stick with me for the rest of my life. You know, I learned to do so
many things. I mean, I'm the fire starter now. I can show people how to start
fires in seconds. I can fish and feed a tribe. I can help build shelters. I can do just about anything
right now. But I totally underestimated and lost focus on, um, the million dollars, as well as, um,
underestimated Stephen and J.T.'s will to win that million dollars. I lost focus in the game, and
that cost me the game.
 On the other side of rites of passage is our last immunity challenge, and I want to fight like hell to win so I can be
guaranteed a spot in the final two.
 We've come a long way, guys.  Yeah, we have.  There's no reason why I lose this challenge.
And it's gonna take an act of Congress to get me to step down from anything. I mean, I won't.
My body would have to fail me.
 This is the final immunity challenge. The person who wins this will definitely be in the final two
and gets to control who he or she takes with him to the final two, and I would like to be the one making that decision.
So I am really going to give it my all in a way that I don't think I have in previous immunity challenges.
Because, you know, this is for a million dollars.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
♪ ♪  PROBST: Guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge?  Yes, sir.
 PROBST: J.T. take back the necklace once again.
For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's challenge is going to require concentration and
coordination. You will place a ball down a chute. The ball will spiral downward
until it drops out the bottom, where you must catch it, place it back in the chute. Every few minutes we'll add
another ball. The balls will alternate left, then right, making it more difficult to keep track of
which chute it's going to drop out of. If at any point any one of your balls hits the ground, you're
out of the challenge. Last person to keep all of their balls in play wins. To make it more fun, one hand
will be tied behind your back.  Wow.  PROBST: At stake-- everything you have worked for for 38
days. You win this challenge, you win immunity, you are guaranteed a spot in the final two and you
will decide who sits next to you at that final Tribal Council. This could very well be a million dollar challenge.
Ready to get to it?  Yeah.  Yes.  PROBST: We'll draw for spots
and we'll get started.
Here we go, the final immunity challenge. Everybody grab your first ball. Three, two, one.
Drop it. This challenge is underway. We'll start with one ball. Let you get the hang of it.
Those ball will alternate. On the left side, then the right side. We're going to go to two balls
in a second.
It's time now to add a second ball.
Everybody's got two balls in play now. Make it a little more complicated.
Also becomes a question of spacing. When do you place that ball back in the chamber?
So that they don't get too close together.
In just a moment, we're going to add a third ball. So start getting ready for it.
It is now time to drop a third ball.
Everybody has got three balls going. This challenge is more mental than it is physical.
Who has the mental focus to last after 38 days out here? One slip, one mental lapse, it's over.
Erinn drops a ball. Erinn is out of this challenge. It is Steven and J.T. battling it out for final immunity and a
guaranteed spot at the final Tribal Council. All Erinn can do now is watch and hope somebody chooses her
to go with them. Three balls now for Stephen and J.T.
Spacing is so critical. When you place the ball in the chute, making sure all three balls are spaced as far apart as
possible. To give you enough reaction time. Stephen with a lucky save.
Stephen with another nice save.
It is now time to place your fourth ball.
Four balls going now.
Everything just ramped up. Stay focused.
Balls are flying. Stephen with another nice save. It's a lot to keep track of.
Keep your concentration.
Don't let your mind drift.
(grunts)  PROBST: Stephen drops out. J.T. wins final immunity and a guaranteed spot...
 Yes!  PROBST: ...in the final two.  Way to go, buddy. Way to go, man.
 Thanks.  Nice job.  Thanks.  PROBST: J.T., you ready for
this?  Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.  PROBST: The third time in a
row, and maybe the most important time, J.T. has immunity. You've gone as far as you can go
in this game. You will be in the final Tribal Council. You will get a chance to plead
your case for a million dollars. Tonight at Tribal Council, you will decide whether it is Erinn or Stephen that sits next to you
at that final Tribal. Big decision, possibly a million dollar decision. You have the afternoon to figure
it out. Grab your stuff. Head back to champ.  You're guaranteed a one in
two shot at a million dollars. And I get to decide who is going up next to me. And Stephen and I had a promise,
but promises come cheap in this game. And, you know, I'm thinking about that, but I try to keep
most of mine. So I got a big decision ahead of me.
♪ ♪  Oh, God.  Thanks, man.  Nice.
 That was hard. When J.T. won today's immunity challenge, I just felt an enormous weight just lifted off
of me.  If you go home before I go home...  All right.
I was really dreading the decision of: do I take J.T. to the final two, my friend, ally, you know, the person who I'm
closest with in this game? Or do I take Erinn who I'm not even particularly fond of, but who I have a very good shot of
winning a million dollars against? It would've been such a scumbag decision to go with Erinn over
J.T. And, like, having that just, like, taken away from me is so gratifying.
 So how you feeling? You think Timbira's going to vote for you?  No. I really don't.
In my situation, every single one of them resents the fact that I outlasted them. Every single one of them.
They all wanted me to go before they went. The only vote that, like, really might come my way is if Taj was
so pissed at you guys she didn't want to vote for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
There's been a lot of talk about how it would be suicide to go up against you.  Is that what Stephen said?
 I think so.  He ever tell you for sure?  Stephen and I made a promise to each other if we do make it
to this point in the game, we take each other to the final two. But I'm finding out that
Stephen's already told Erinn the same thing. So, uh, why he didn't keep up his end of the deal, I'll never
know. This is a game where you have to be ruthless. And I know I can hands-down
beat Erinn.  He's going to argue it so well, too.  I know.
 Like, the man is so much more eloquent than we are.  I know.
 Yeah.  So you'd be the more logical person to take. No doubt about it.
 I think J.T. taking Stephen to the final two is a very noble thing to do. They have come a long way
together in this game. They've been together since the beginning. And to take him would be, like,
very honorable. They can kind of fight it out to the end, but it might just be a draw.
It's going to be a very close battle. And what I know about J.T. is that he's somebody that really
wants and really needs this money. And if J.T. wants to win a million dollars, he'll send
Stephen home tonight. It's the only thing that makes sense.
 I mean, I didn't...  She has a very good one.
 That's not true. You know that.  I hope so.  If you want to talk through
something, I'm willing to talk through it.  What do you mean?  No, if you're just having
doubts or something, you know? I know it's a hard decision, though, anyway. I mean, you have to think about
it.  I mean, it's a guaranteed million dollars for her.
 I just gotta... I always question my decisions, you know.  I understand. That's why we work well together.
We both question our decisions. It would make good sense for J.T. to take Erinn with him to the final two.
Why take a gamble on me when he could have a lock with Erinn, you know? When we took out Taj, when we
took out Coach-- we've always kept in mind that there's a lot of money at stake here. And do we want to let sentiment
get in the way of that money? So, I think it's going to be a really difficult decision for J.T. tonight.
But I believe that I have a good read on J.T., and on what his word means and when he means it. I don't think he will betray me
tonight. I think the fact that you take me will do wonders. I mean, I think everyone's going
to really respect that. You have to know that you're going to win this. I've known that since we first
started our partnership. I've always known that.  I sure don't know it.
 I'm a nervous man. I know that you're solid, but, like, it's still scary.
 My mom told me when I left, "J.T., I know you're strong and you're smart. You can win this game.
If anybody can do it, you can do it. Just don't do anything stupid." And that keeps running through
my head, and to blow that opportunity on trust to someone I've known for only 39 days-- if I was to lose because of that
decision I made, I think everybody would be pretty disappointed in me.
♪ ♪
 PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Debbie, Coach.
And Taj, voted out at the last Tribal Council.
Well, J.T., you have certainly earned your way into this spot, winning the last three individual immunity challenges.
Now you have probably the biggest decision in this game-- who you're going to take with you to the final vote tomorrow
night at Tribal Council. Erinn, I'm guessing you made a case today. What do you say to J.T.?
What's your pitch?  We sat down and we talked about votes, plain and simple. If the two of us go, you can
probably count on this vote, this vote, this vote, this vote. I might get this one and this one.
And if you take Stephen, it could very likely be very close. He might be able to beat you.  PROBST: So you pitched a case
that "you can beat me. I want to make it to the end and you'll win against me."  I will not go down without
kicking and screaming about it, but he could very well win against me. Probably has a better shot than
against Stephen.  PROBST: Stephen, you get some time with J.T. What's your pitch?
 Well, you know, J.T. and I have been partners in crime since day two of this game. We have basically shared a brain
and made every move of this game together, and, you know, I think my pitch was more based on sort of our long-term commitments to
each other, what that would mean in the future for our enduring friendship and relationship, and just the promises we had made to
each other.  PROBST: So, J.T., two very different choices: loyalty with Stephen, been together since day
one; easy money against Erinn-- "That's why I came here, to win." So how does this work itself out
in your head?  There's two different approaches, and I've just got to figure out which one is more
important to me. I do feel like I could beat Erinn really easily compared to the match-up I would have
against Stephen in the jury votes. No doubt about it. So both of 'em make good cases.
Which one is more important to me-- come here and win the easy million dollars or, you know, stay with what's gotten me this
far?  PROBST: So the case to be made for bringing Stephen is what?
 I think if I was to bring the best to the end, out of us three I would be bringing Stephen to the end, and I think if I took
Stephen, I would be sticking to my word.  PROBST: So in a game that really is about outwitting
everybody, why make the moral choice to go with somebody you promised you'd bring to the end?  I've got to think about:
would Stephen have done the same thing had he won?  PROBST: What's your gut tell you?
 I don't know, I'll never know, but I'd be sticking my neck out a lot if I took Stephen to the end because-- Stephen is
an excellent guy. Just like I did, he made good relationships in this game. You know, I do feel like taking
Stephen is a huge risk.  Can... Can I interject?  PROBST: Yeah.  There's also a lot of added
reasons why we should go to the end together, not least is this breakfast that we've talked about having on day 39 since day
two, you know...  PROBST: And you know, I got to admit, when you weigh a million dollars versus a
breakfast with your 39-day friend, you're right, that's a tough one.  My point is that there's more
to a relationship than a million dollars.  PROBST: Let me ask you this, Stephen.
He doesn't pick you. He takes Erinn and he wins. You're not friends after this?  I mean, I think we would be
friends. I don't think it would be the same kind of friendship. The swears that he has made to
me, like, defy all swears that I've ever made. And look, I have made promises that I've broken in this game.
There's no question about that. I have absolutely lied, deceived people, and made promises that I have broken, you know.
I might be number one blindsider or Jed is number one blindsider. I don't know, but-- I mean, up and down, to God, to himself, to
his life, so I mean, you know, I'm hoping.  PROBST: Erinn, you might be best off saying nothing at all.
Stephen might be making a better case for you than you could make for yourself.  (laughing): Damn.
 Sure.  I'll shut my mouth, all right.  PROBST: I'm just observing.
 No, I mean, look, I'm obviously very nervous tonight. I think we all are except for J.T.
 I'm pretty damn nervous myself.  (laughing): I think he's more nervous than we are.
 PROBST: So, J.T., now make the case for bringing Erinn and saying, "Sorry, Stephen, loyalty went only 38 days.
It doesn't go the whole way."  You know, I'm not 100%, but I feel like I'd have a much better opportunity beating Erinn in
jury votes because I do know that her tribemates were trying to get rid of her on, like, day nine.
That alone tells me that they would not really want to give her a million dollars compared to me, so, you know, there's,
there's a huge, huge reason why I should take Erinn to the final two.  PROBST: Let's get to the
vote. Here's how it's going to work: Erinn and Stephen, you cannot vote for J.T.
You cannot vote for yourself. Therefore, you will not vote. Which means, J.T., you're the only one voting.
If you choose right, this time tomorrow night, you're a millionaire. It's time to vote.
Make your vote, J.T.
I'll go get the vote.
Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately. I'll read the vote.
14th person voted out, and the seventh and final member of our jury...
Erinn. Bring me your torch.
Erinn, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Well, J.T. and Stephen, you've gone as far as you can go in this game. The power now shifts to the
jury. Tomorrow night, they will decide which of the two of you they feel most deserving of the
title of sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes along with it. You have one more night in
Brazil. Enjoy it. I'll see you tomorrow night for your final Tribal Council.
Good night.
 I was a little bit surprised, but I think, like, deep down, I definitely knew that that was the decision that J.T. was going
to make, and I'm really proud of myself for as far as I've come. It's really been life-changing, and I'm glad I was able to
stick around as long as I did.
 I feel really great. It's day 39. Uh, the sun's coming up. It's a beautiful morning, and,
uh, I'm still here. Stephen's here with me, just like we planned a long time ago. And it's kind of hard to
believe, you know.  So, you and I are going to be friends for life.  I know, man.
 It's hugely satisfying to be here with J.T. at the end. Since the beginning of the game, we've been talking about final
two, and here we are, final freaking two, day 39, and regardless of what happens, regardless of who ultimately
wins, that's something that, you know, can't be taken away from us. Damn, we talked about this on,
like, day three-- we said final two.  We dominated the entire game. Physically and socially.
 Tree mail. Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Dude, there are eggs here!  And a bottle of bubbly.
 We are going to have a huge freaking breakfast. The warrior and the wizard. Day 39.
 This is awesome.  I mean, it was like a cornucopia-- eggs, sausages, bread.
 I usually don't eat very much.  Me, neither.  But this is incredible.
 So, we spent the next couple of hours doing it right. We cooked everything straight through.
 Whoo!  Cooked to perfection.  This is the best meal. I'm not worrying about strategy.
 Mm-hmm. J.T. and I have been talking about day 39 together as this symbol of our achievement
together. This was our reward for overcoming all of the obstacles in our way, and we got to share
it-- just us, successful.  Won't shake it up, 'cause I don't want to waste any. Oh!
 Whoo! This stuff goes right to your head. (J.T. chuckling)
Well, this definitely deserves a toast.  Yup.  Day 39, final two.
 Final two.
 Mmm. Tastes like victory.  It's not too bad. (sighs)
 This is the perfect ending. First impressions-- what was your first impression of me?  You looked like you were
strong, but you looked very unathletic, and I thought you were really religious. I'm going to have to watch my
mouth around you. I think I'm changed for the better. Uh, you know, don't judge a book
by its cover, obviously, and, uh, don't go off first impressions. Outside of the country guy and
the city guy, you know, when it comes down to it, we're a lot alike.  I thought you were, like,
just like a charmer. I just thought you were like a... a gregarious, kind of charming, slick guy.
My first impression of J.T. was, you know, we're not going to get along, but I was totally wrong about J.T.
He might be the good old boy from the South, but he's ended up being the person whose mind has worked most like my own.
And that, to me, is really surprising, that in spite of our completely different backgrounds, our minds seemed
to work totally in sync. (squawking)
 Ready, boy.  Let's do it.
 Stephen and myself-- we are the last two standing. Going into the Tribal Council tonight, there's no doubt about
it. I'm going to have to lay all of our friendship stuff aside, because whatever it takes to win
a million dollars, now I got to do it. You know, I brought along competition.
That's what I wanted, and I got it, but, man... I've never had any doubts in Tribal Council until tonight.
 When I go into Tribal Council tonight, I have a story to tell, and I'm going to tell it.
I'm going to argue my case. I'm not going to go in defeated. I'm not going to be, like, "J.T.'s awesome.
Let's all give him a round of applause and a million bucks." I'm going to fight for it. I don't know which way the jury
will vote, but I am not going to go away without a fight.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, Deb, Coach, Taj and Erinn, voted
out at the last Tribal Council.
Stephen, J.T., congratulations. After 39 days, you have gone as far as you can go in this game. The power now shifts to the
jury. They hold your fate in their hands. Tonight the jury will decide
which of the two of you they think is most worthy of the title of sole survivor and the million dollars that goes along
with it. Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a chance to make an opening statement, plead
your case-- why you deserve to win. The jury will then get their first chance to address you, and
then we will vote. Let's get started. Stephen, you're up. Opening statement.
 Um, I mean, it's obviously hard to talk, you know, against J.T. now and to sort of compare myself to him, since we have
been through so much together, but, you know, if you are making this decision based on who is the better woodsman or who had
the best and most charming Southern drawl, you know, you could have made this decision on day one and spared everyone a
lot of struggle and a lot of hunger. And, you know, we since the very early days just sort of shared a
brain when it came to strategy. You know, we'd talk through everything, decide everything together, and I think that's why
we did so well, because we were able to work together, but I kind of want to focus maybe on not what we brought into the
game but what we've taken out of the game. And, you know, I came into the game extremely uncomfortable in
my own skin. You know, I had never been camping before, so I think my road has been a lot harder, and
that transformation has made me more comfortable, more self-reliant, and I think a better person, and I owe a lot
of that, also, to just all of you. And, uh, you know, as a testament to the struggles that
we've all sort of faced to get here, and the journey we've all had together, I hope you vote for me tonight.
 PROBST: J.T.?  It's going to be hard to follow up on that. I'm obviously not a, you know,
graduate or English major, anything like my buddy Stephen here. I'm actually the first person in
my family to ever graduate college, but don't think I want a pity vote. Because I worked very hard to
get where I'm at. I did everything I possibly could to provide for everybody at every chance I got.
And most of the times that guy that puts things like that on the line-- they're voted out right off the bat, you know.
And to do that and accept it and never get a vote in this game, not once, you know, is a huge accomplishment for me.
And to make friends with you guys. I mean, it was very hard to vote you guys out.
The way we picked who we voted off was the people that we thought were going to vote us off.
And had we not gotten rid of you you'd be sitting where I'm at today and I'd be over there. There's no doubt about it.
But I do stick to my word, you know. I had a really easy opportunity to bring Erinn who I felt like--
Erinn, you know, no offense-- was I felt like I could beat up here a lot easier, you know. Everyone loves Stephen.
I do, too. So I feel like he deserved to be here beside me. Do I feel like he's outwitted,
outplayed, and outlasted me? I don't think so. But that's in your guys' hands now.
That's about all.  PROBST: Thanks, Stephen. Thanks, J.T. All right, jury, in a moment
you're going to get your first chance to address Stephen and J.T. Give you a minute to think about
what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right, jury, it's now your first chance to address Stephen and J.T., hoping to gather a little information
to help you make a very big decision-- who deserves to win this game, who deserves the million dollars.
Brendan, let's get started. You're up first.  Congratulations to you guys both.
It's been fun watching you both play the game. My first question is for Stephen.
You spent so much of your first argument talking about your growth within the game. For me I look at, you know, all
the different sporting events and all the different games that we've all seen, and in not one game is who works hardest or who
grows the most the reason that you win the game. Can you think of anything?  I mean, the game of  Survivor
actually might be one of them. I mean, there's that outwit, out-outplay, outlast. So there is that outwit
component. I obviously had to focus more on that than outplay.  So should you be handicapped?
 No, no, but I'm saying for me to last this long has been a real struggle. You know, J.T.'s an amazing
outdoorsman. I came in with none of these skills, I still persevered and will be leaving the game with
many of them.  J.T., you know, when you think about this idea of growth, in terms of deciding who should
actually come home with a million dollars, do you think it's relevant?  Growth is irrelevant, really.
I mean, that's something you can carry home with you. That's something that's good for you personally, but, obviously,
you know, if you go to a football game and just because it was harder for you to catch the ball and you catch it,
doesn't make it better than the person that already knew how to catch it. So, I do feel like I outplayed
Stephen and, you know, Stephen hid in the shadows in some of the challenges. I had to tell him, "Dude, you
can do it." Have confidence in yourself.  I mean, can I-- can I have a rebuttal to what he just said?
 Sure, I love it. Let's go.  Okay, um, hiding in the shadows is a legitimate strategy.
I think we all know that.  I would think a guy that puts his neck out on the line would-- should earn a little more
respect than someone that kind of floats under the radar.  Okay. Cool.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Erinn. You're up.  Stephen, I have seen you play three very specific alliances--
the Jalapao three, the Exile alliance, the Warrior alliance. But almost everyone in every one of those alliances is on
the jury. So should I just vote for J.T.?  Look, you know, obviously this game involves a lot of, you
know, creating a lot of dynamic structures and then working within those structures to advance yourself as best as you
can. In terms of moving within those alliances, zigging when you have to zig, zagging when you have to
zag to get yourself further... I think I did that really well. If you respect that aggressive style of play, I hope you vote
for me. And I-- if you don't, I understand if you don't.  Okay.
J.T., there's been a lot of talk about taking the strength to the end. Can you be really honest and
tell me why Stephen is the best?  I felt like Stephen was the best because at the time he was the most honest person with me.
No matter what we done, he was always there, and I feel like in Jalapao he was definitely the best, and when we moved over,
Coach said, "Who is the next strongest person?" I said out of everybody in Jalapao, Stephen is the best.
You know, I could have left him out there, but I brought him along in the power alliance. And out of the power alliance
that I thought was the best, it would be me and Stephen, no doubt about it.  PROBST: Thanks.
Deb, you're up.  Hi, guys. I want to start by telling you that I haven't decided...
as to who is going to have my vote for a million dollars. J.T., one of the things that is most important to me is honesty.
I immediately was drawn to you. I was like this is a great guy, great, pure heart. As the game progressed, all of a
sudden, I thought, man, I misjudged this guy. So was my first instinct right? Or is lying and deception your
MO, and you just let me think that you're somebody else in the beginning?  Debbie, I'll be honest with
you-- when I come into this game my mother told me do not believe what everybody tells you. You're going to have to lie to
win this game. A million dollars on the line. I mean, you'd have done the same thing I did at the end of the
game. You know, you didn't go tell Coach, that, "Hey, I'm fixing to vote you out," you know.
I had to do that in order to get here.  Okay, I appreciate that. I appreciate that.
Stephen, my question is, if yesterday you had the immunity necklace on that J.T. had, would J.T. be the one sitting next to
you right now? I want an honest answer to this question.  All right, I'll tell you
honestly, and I want to speak honestly in answer to every question tonight. I-- I don't know.
And I never made that decision...  No, that-that's not good. No, stop.
I like you, Stephen.  Okay.  I do, but-but I don't want "I don't know."
I've got to decide if I'm voting for you, for a million dollars. You do know who would be sitting next to you, and I, quite
frankly, feel like I might, too. I need a clear answer from you, Stephen. And I need you to be honest.
That's what I'm basing my vote on is honesty.  I think it would be Erinn. I-I hope I would have taken
J.T. My fear is that I would've chosen Erinn if it had come down to it.
 Thank you. Okay, I appreciate that. Good luck to both of you. I'll listen the rest of the
evening, and my vote's still out there. Thank you.  PROBST: Thanks. Thanks, Deb.
Coach, you're up.  Last two remnants of the power alliance. Makes me a little bit proud to
see the warrior and the wizard up here. A lot of unanswered questions. You know, I had a lot of
philosophies coming into this game. One of them was "as iron sharpens iron, so one man
sharpens another." So, keep that in mind and we'll start with you, J.T. Honesty and integrity.
Early on, it's easy to keep that. Late in the game, when it counts is what I want to hear
examples and then the second part of that is being the noble warrior, putting others in front of yourself while being
ferocious on the battlefield. So, give me examples of honesty late in the game when it counts and also being that noble
warrior.  Coach, there was times towards the end of the game where I couldn't tell you
everything that was going on, but when I made a promise to you, like the one I made after the last challenge we had, I
said, "I promise you, I'm voting for Erinn." I knew you were going home that night, but there was no way
I was gonna vote for you, Coach, because you and I and Stephen could've been sitting here. I'd have felt comfortable taking
you because I knew you'd have taken me to the final two. Uh, you know, I thought Stephen would, um, but, you know, I just
found out otherwise. I said I would take the strongest that was left to the end and I could have took the
easy million dollars with Erinn. I risked a million dollars in order to keep my word to you and keep my word to Stephen,
bringing the strongest that was left to the end. I may be that dumb fool that mixes morals with millions, you
know? And as far as being a warrior, I battled everything I done 100%, no matter what, and I
never give up on anything I do.  Okay, I'm going to move to Stephen. Same question-- honor and
integrity, and being a warrior.  All right, I think that, I mean, in terms of honor and integrity, this may sound
perverse, but I voted for every single one of you. I never took the weasel way out. And J.T. knew you were getting
a limit... Well, I don't want to... I mean, I'm not gonna make that comparison. I'm sorry.
 I told 'em that.  I want to say that I did vote for every one of you, because I felt like if I was going to try
to take you out, I was going to bear the moral burden of that. Um, so whenever there was a vote, I absolutely wanted to
write the person's name down. In terms of being a noble warrior, I have yet to say anything negative about J.T.
tonight, and I think that... I think that's a strong statement.  Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Coach. Sierra. You're up.  Congratulations to both of
you. I had a question for Stephen tonight, and he pretty much already addressed all of it, so
I don't have any further questions for you. I've heard enough. I still think you're a
sweetheart, Stephen. And for J.T., my question for you is, what does taking the strongest really mean to you?
Because you're standing with one of the weakest players I've ever seen. And when you had the choice to
take Taj with you, you took another weak player, Erinn. So actually, you took the two weakest players with you.
How do you admire that and want to sit next to that?  Actually, I really feel like Stephen is a strong competitor.
He won the individual immunity necklace and almost beat me in the final immunity challenge. And of the stronger players that
was left in the final four, I believe that Stephen was the strongest left.  You choosing Stephen was the
right thing, but you lost a lot of my respect, because you could have been sitting here tonight with Tyson.
You could have been sitting here tonight with Brendan or Debbie. And that vote, if you would have won, you would have been a
stronger man, because you were sitting next to a strong competitor. That just may be your downfall
and the reason why you might not get a million dollars tonight.  PROBST: Thanks, Sierra. Tyson.
 Dudes. Good job, guys. Um, you both have talked about sharing a brain on all the
strategy. Actually, Stephen said J.T. was an asset to him getting to the final.
J.T., was Stephen an asset for you in getting to the final, as well, and why?  I think Stephen did help me
as far as keeping each other in check. But could I do it without him? I feel like I could have made
this adventure without him, but I don't think it would have been near as easy.  Stephen, you want to reply
to that?  I think J.T. and my partnership was unique. I'm sorry that he devalues it
like that. It hurts me a lot. I mean, to say that, "Oh, yeah, it could be you, it could be
someone else," when we worked so well together. You know, that obviously, I don't think that's true.
I don't think that's true for either of us. I don't think it's true for him, and I don't think it's true for
me.  Do you think you would have been sitting here had someone else won immunity last night?
 That's a complicated question, right? Like, who's gonna be...? Who is it?
I think Erinn would have taken me. I think Taj would have taken me.  Okay.
 So, yeah.  Are we done on that?  Yeah.  Okay.
Thanks, boys.  PROBST: Thanks, Tyson. Taj. Finish us off.
 Crushed, betrayed, extremely disappointed. It's not so much that I'm on the jury right now.
It's just the way I went to the jury. I just felt it was so unnecessary.
But that's the nature of the game. So my first question, I guess, would be to J.T.
You found it so hard to put Coach's name down on the paper. You don't want to lie to him. But it seemed like it was
effortless to put my name down on the paper. Did you not think that it would be hard to lie to me?
 Taj, there was nothing effortless about putting your name down. The hardest vote I made in this
game was voting you out. Taj, I've stuck my neck out for you this whole game, as well as you for me.
We've been like brother and sister. I mean, it was almost harder than my vote last night.
 And Stephen, I saw things in you that I just... I didn't even recognize on the last two or three days.
Especially you, because you, from, like, day one, was in my back pocket. We-We were tight.
At least I thought. Was it so important to blindside me to get me out, because was I that much of a threat?
 All right, I guess, I mean, the truth is J.T. had been talking about taking you out next for a while.
I had wanted to keep you around until three. And part of that was because it would be a great statement for
the Jalapao three, to end up, you know, facing this entire Timbira jury. But J.T. was concerned that
you were a tougher physical competitor to beat. I got nervous that you wouldn't take me, and sort of gave in on
the point. So that's why I ended up agreeing to vote you out.  Taj, I'd like to add, he just
made it sound like it was just my idea to take you out. That's not true. That's not true at all.
And I'll tell him that any day of the week. He made... He just made himself sound like, you know, he was the
one protecting you. That's-That's not how it went down.  Well, I mean, to be fair,
then, if... Let's air our laundry. There have been other times when J.T. wanted to take you out, and
I talked him out of it. The first was in Jalapao. Because you had given us possession of the idol, J.T.
thought we could eliminate you and safely have the idol.  You told me, "I've got the idol.
She won't have the idol if we vote her out now."  No, no, no. You said...  No, no.
 No, no, no, that's not what happened. That is not what happened. I said...
 You know what? It's neither here nor there. That's fine.  There were times when I saved
you, and J.T. wanted to take you out.  That's fine. Thank you.  Is this the same guy I
brought with me?  Yes.  What are you...? Oh, come on now.
You have been slandering me all night, and I have... I... This is the first time I ever took a shot at you.
 But mine have been all accurate.  And mine have been true... That is true, as well.
This... Come on, now. Our friendship means more to me than winning does.  But you'd have brought Erinn.
 I never made that decision in my heart. I mean, you can believe me, or you can...
You know, that's fine.  I just feel like a fool, man.  Oh, come on, now. I mean... Oh, look, whatever.
All right.  PROBST: Jury, some great questions. Some very revealing answers.
You now, hopefully, have enough information to make a million-dollar decision. I'm going to give you a moment
to think about that very big vote.
 PROBST: All right, jury, you have had your chance to address Stephen and J.T. Now it is time to make a very
big vote. Tonight you are voting for a winner. The name you write down is the
name of the person you think is most deserving of the title of sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes
along with it. For the last time, it is time to vote. Brendan, you're up.
 Nice job.
 I am a woman of my word. You should try to be a man the same way.
 PROBST: For the last time, I'll go tally the votes.
Thank you all for a great season of  Survivor. I will see you back in New York City for the reading of the
votes.
(cheers and applause)
 PROBST: All right. That's what we like.
Glad to have you guys here.
All right. Have a seat.
Good live audience tonight. I like it. (fan shouts) (audience laughing)
 PROBST: I love you, too. All right, jury, nice job. Stephen... J.T., great job.
This is a hard game to play. 39 days in the middle of nowhere stuck with people you don't know that you may like, may not like,
in a game that is physically, emotionally, mentally taxing 24 hours a day is no small feat. The winner of this game deserves
the million dollars.  J.T.! (audience laughing)  Stephen!
 Thank you.  PROBST: We got people that want J.T. We got people that want Stephen.
Let's get to it. There are seven votes in here. Tonight, you want to see your name.
This is only time on  Survivor you want to see your name on the parchment. These are votes for a winner.
It takes four votes to win. I'll read the votes.
First vote. J.T. (cheering)
Second vote. The warrior, J.T. (cheering)
J.T. That's three votes, J.T. (cheering)
 Oh, my God.  PROBST: Will Stephen keep it going, or will it be a blowout?
The winner of  Survivor: Tocantins. J.T. (cheering)
