 PROBST: Previously on Survivor:  Yes.  PROBST: Brendan and Sierra
were in possession of the hidden immunity idol at Timbira. While their allies, Taj and Stephen, made the discovery at
Jalapao.  Okay, stuff this in your pocket. Do something with it, hide it.
 PROBST: Launch. Spencer's poor defense at the challenge cost Jalapao immunity. So J.T. wanted to vote him out.
 I don't have any problem writing his name down.  I don't want to get rid of anyone, but it's got to be
Spencer.  Everybody can kiss my ass.  PROBST: And Taj's frustration at the loss caught
Joe's attention.  Moves like that out here will get you voted off.  PROBST: But Taj was saved
when the tribe came to an agreement. Spencer, the tribe has spoken. Down one member, can Jalapao
regain their momentum? 11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 What's up, Big T?  Right.  Nobody wants to go.  They're definitely not going
to get any easier, though.  I know.  It didn't bother me at all to see Spencer go.
Only the fact that, you know, if there's a merge at ten, rather than going in six-four, we only have a shot at going in
five-five.. Within the tribe right now, I mean, we're all united. So if we were to lose again,
it's going to be another tough one.
 I'm serious, I'm tell you straight up.  I definitely feel nervous about being a target if we do
end up losing the next immunity challenge because the boys might stick together. Joe is awesome in challenges,
and Stephen and J.T. are always hanging out together. So I feel like Taj and I are on the chopping block.
 You'll go to the merge. Sydney's very nervous because she knows that every time we lose, she's getting potentially
closer to going home. And Taj is a very strong challenger for a spot in the tribe.
But I think J.T. and Steve trust Sydney, plus, I got a little thing for Syd. I mean, she's gorgeous, so
she's safe. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you got a free pass.  I'm excited.

(thunder rumbles) (bird shrieking)
 Today, we were cooking beans, and they were finished. But Coach likes the beans cooked softer, so he decided to add
dirty river water.
(thunder rumbles)  The beans are just barely done, and that's when they eat them because they can't just
wait. And actually it makes the beans taste good. You know, I mean, come on.
(thunder rumbles)
 Yeah.  This nasty storm has been rolling in all day. We knew it was coming, and it's
just like, Coach, like, that's a pretty selfish decision.
The worst part was is he put all that stuff in there, and then he didn't stay out there and tend to the beans.
Instead, he just got inside the shelter. It's another one of those "Coach moments."
 It tastes funny.  I don't know what happened.  They're not good?  Some of these beans are
like charcoal.  Eventually, the rain stopped, and the beans burned-- just stuck to the whole entire
bottom. We lost a good amount of beans.  Half of our beans are burned to the pot.
 Gross.  Ew!  I mean, it's almost like eating charcoal.
 Oh, my goodness.  There's just a part of me that finally just had had it. I'm tired of feeding his needs.
 I don't know how many times we can clean the pot, but it's just going to cook it more and more each time.
 We didn't we clean the pot after last time?  I don't think that's why two inches of buildup came onto it.
 I'm just frustrated, as you would have been to one of us if we would have done it.  And the truth shall set you
free, Sierra. Go and be free! Always about the beans. Beans, beans, beans.
Who gives a rip about these beans? It was really a combination that I wanted them to cook
longer. If it started raining, it was just a bad combination. No need to blame anybody.
I know, that's what's eating at you, and you wanted to say that. So thank you for saying that. I will acknowledge it.
In fact, I'll take full responsibility. I don't care. I screwed up the beans, my bad.
Forgive me, all of you. Especially you, Sierra, who seems to have the most angst about it.
 If you want your beans made a different way, maybe you should make it in a different pot.  I probably won't make a
separate pot for my beans. You know, I can't believe this is going on over such a trivial subject.
Screw all this stuff. It's all meaningless. Water under the bridge, hopefully.
It doesn't seem like it, but hopefully it is.  With Coach, there's probably five, six situations like that
where Coach has done things where you're just like, "Come on, that's really not for the best of everybody.
That's for the best of just you." But while he does do some irritating things, I totally
accept it because he's a predictable player. And predictable in this game is-is great.
 I know. They're so good, though.  I know. It's day 16, and it's getting
strange around here. Jalapao has only five tribe members left. Hopefully, everyone's got a good
outlook on me. I am a country boy, you know, and it's hard for me to be mean to people.
I've been honest with everyone here at Jalapao so far, and I'm gonna do my best to stay that way.
Hopefully, everyone's being honest with me as well.
(Taj laughs)  What do you think?  No, it'll work. I just heard it cracking.
 Well, I just think it will solidify that I trust him enough, you know, to tell him the truth.
 I just think it might make him wary of you.  Mm, I see what you're saying.  After the last Tribal
Council, when J.T. voted for Spencer over me, I-I just... that's when I knew that he was definitely in our corner.
 Taj came and said, "I want to tell J.T. about the idol." Until J.T. knows, I'm basically controlling the information flow
between Taj and J.T. and to the extent possible, I want to remain that bridge because if they connect, you know, I might
become a less essential part of the loop. He's going to trust me less, too.
J.T. will if we tell him about the idol.  I wasn't gonna implicate you at all.
 Right, I'm just saying. You haven't...  The real alliance for me is my four-person alliance once
the merge happens, which is Steve, Brendan, Sierra, and myself. Here I just want to make it to
the merge, and with J.T. on my side, I'm going to be in good shape.  So, you're not going to tell
him about Brendan then?  Oh, no, no, no. Just about the idol.  Okay.
 Yeah, just about the idol.
 No, I'm not sure at all.  Okay.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! Timbira getting your first look at the new Jalapao tribe. Spencer voted out at the last
Tribal Council.  Crazy.  PROBST: Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
 Yeah!  PROBST: For today's challenge, each tribe will have five minutes to build a
barricade inside the other tribe's frame. You will then attempt to toss ceramic pigs through the
barricade the other tribe built in your frame. If you drop a pig or if it breaks, it doesn't count.
The tribe with the most pigs on their bench at the end of ten minutes wins reward. Want to know what you're
playing for?  Yeah!  PROBST: The winning tribe will be taken to a beautiful
waterfall where you will enjoy a relaxing afternoon barbecue. Hamburgers, all the fixings. In addition, the winning tribe
will choose one member from the losing tribe to go to Exile Island. That person will in turn choose
somebody from the winning tribe to join them, which means somebody from the winning tribe will not partake in the reward.
I know it's worth playing for. Timbira, you have one extra member, sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same person
in back-to-back challenges. Who's going to sit this one out?  Erinn.
 PROBST: Erinn, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, we'll get started.
Here we go, first stage. Each tribe will have five minutes to build a barricade in the other tribe's frame.
Survivors ready? Go!  Come on, guys!  PROBST: The idea is to make
this as impenetrable as possible so the other tribe can't get their pig through.  Right here, just like that.
 We need to put all these in the front.  That solid?  No.
 They're building X's.  Look what they're doing.  PROBST: Four minutes left. You need to make them count.
 PROBST: Five, four, three, two,
one. Stop the work. That's it.
All right, each tribe now has ten minutes to get as many ceramic pigs through the barricade built by the other
tribe as you can. Tribe with the most pigs at the end of ten minutes wins reward. Survivors ready?
Go.  Come on, guys.  PROBST: Can only throw one pig at a time.
If it drops or it breaks like that one, doesn't count.
 Sorry. Next.  Come on, guys!  PROBST: A lot of pigs
breaking right now. Big learning curve here. Brendan to Tyson. Easily to Coach.
Coach to Sierra. Timbira is on the board with their first point. There's one through.
Joe to J.T. J.T. trying to get it to Sydney. Low again. Tyson and Coach have a good
rhythm going. Timbira now with two.  Come on, Joe.  Okay.
 PROBST: Nice catch by Coach. Timbira on a roll. Timbira now with three pigs.  Catch this one.
 PROBST: J.T. to Sydney. This time they connect. Jalapao on the board with their first pig.
Timbira now with four to one. Those pigs hurt when they hit your body.  Come on, Syd.
 Nice catch by Sydney. That's two for Jalapao. Timbira with the fifth pig. It's five-two.
Tyson to Coach. Timbira with another one. Sydney with another nice catch. J.T. and Sydney have something
good going. Jalapao starting to catch up. J.T. to Sydney. That's six-four, Timbira leads.
That's seven for Timbira.  Coach.  That's all right, Tyson. You're the man.
You're the man. You're the man.  PROBST: That's seven-five. That's eight for Timbira.
That's six for Jalapao. Tyson breaks another one.  All right, man, we got it.  PROBST: Timbira starting to
fall apart. We are now eight-seven. Joe to J.T., J.T. to Sydney. Yes, we are tied eight-eight!
Jalapao is back in it now. Timbira nine. Jalapao eight. J.T. to Sydney.
We are tied again nine-nine. Three minutes left. Jalapao now in the lead. Ten-nine.
 Come on, Joe.  Come on, Joe.  Tyson, you're throwing them too hard, buddy.
 PROBST: Jalapao now with 11. Jalapao has come from behind, is now leading this challenge. Jalapao with their 12th.
Timbira now with 11. Brendan to Tyson. Tyson snakes it through to Coach.
Timbira now at 12. It is neck and neck.  Come on.  PROBST: One minute left.
Tyson to Coach. Timbira with another one. Timbira now in the lead, 13-12. J.T. to Sydney.
That's 13, Jalapao. We are tied 13-13. 30 seconds left. Jalapao, you've got to make
these count.  I got it.  Let's go, guys. Let's go.  PROBST: Time running out.
We are still tied 13-13. Ten seconds.  Catch it!  Come on, guys.
 PROBST: Five, four...  We got it. You betcha.  PROBST: three...
two, one. That's it! (cheering) Timbira wins reward.
 Give me the pig! Let me smash it!
 PROBST: Timbira, congratulations. All right, first decision. Who from Jalapao are you going
to send to Exile Island?  Right now, everything with Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is in place.
We have both idols. We have the alliance intact. So, when Timbira had to send someone to Exile Island, all I
kept thinking was, send someone else.  Joe.  PROBST: Joe going to Exile
Island. Joe, grab your personal items. Come on over. Joe, now you have a little
power. You get to pick somebody from Timbira to join you on Exile, and you will keep them from the
waterfall, burgers, all the fixings.  Uh... come on, Erinn.
The decision to bring Erinn with me to Exile was strategic because going into a merge, we need somebody to flip, and my
charm game is definitely part of my strategy, and she's an attractive woman.  PROBST: Who wants the map?
 He can take it.  I'll take it.  PROBST: All right, guys. Head out to Exile.
You'll both return in time for the next immunity challenge. Timbira, ready for a fun afternoon?
 Absolutely!  Like nothing else.  PROBST: Grab your stuff. Head out. Enjoy it.
 Bye, guys.  Thanks. See you, guys.  PROBST: All right, guys.
I got nothing for you. Jalapao, head back to camp.  We definitely lost a reward today, and it sucked, but I'm
not going to feel sorry for myself all day. I mean, I don't really care about the reward.
It's just a reward. But if we lose the next immunity challenge, we go down six-four in numbers, so we just can't
blow it. We need to win. (squealing excitedly)  Yep.
 High five, man.  Oh, yeah!  When we walked into the reward, we saw, like, the
perfect all-American picnic. I mean, watermelon, chips, cooler of drinks.  Look, there's hamburgers
over there on the grill! Oh, my God!  I'm going to eat enough to puke, and then I have room for
hamburgers after that.  Oh, yum.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my gosh!
 Unbelievable.  The first bite of the burger was just like heaven, basically.  There's so much food that I
can't fit enough in my mouth.  Manners were out the window. Eating as much as we could. I mean, we were like animals.
 Oh, my gosh!  Oh, my God, look at that waterfall.  This is so amazing.
 The water is just so crystal clear. It's beautiful.  Oh, wow.
 A small part of me feels guilty that Erinn is not here, but in my opinion, she's lucky to still be in this game.
These people right here, uh, from the tribe, these are the people I would have picked to be enjoying this with.
 Go. (cheering)  All in all, a great win, great day.
There's no bickering. It's awesome. It's good to feel that momentum back, especially this late in
the game. (laughter)
 "You must each choose an urn." I insist. Ladies first.
 All right, he's out. I'll see you in a while.  Later.  Joe and I came out to Exile,
picked two urns, and I got the one with the clue in it. It's very apparent that the idol is not here.
It's back at camp. And if it's back at camp, there's more than one, so now I just need to figure out: do I
trust Joe? Do I not trust Joe? Because I have no alliances out here.
So, he could be a good ally, and if we were aligned and had two idols, that might not be a bad thing for us.
 So, who's your favorite over there?  I don't know about favorites. Can you have favorites in this?
How about you?  Uh, J.T. J.T. is a good dude.  Yeah, he seems like it.
 We'll be up and running here soon. Need any help with those clues?  Oh, maybe.
I'll let you know.  Let me know. Maybe we can work on it together or something.
I picked the empty urn, and I have no clue where the idol is. Uh, I think she knows where it's at, so hopefully I can just get
it out of her, but we'll see how it goes. There's got to be one out here, you know.
Let's go find both of them.
They're at camp?  I decided I was going to tell Joe about the idol. I'm hoping that Joe turns out to
be a trustworthy individual. "Go to the spot where you often get mail. "Don't skirt the issue.
Try lifting the veil."  It's right there.  Yeah.  Your tree mail.
 Easy if it's still there.  I'll let you know, all right?  Good stuff.  This couldn't be any better
right now. I picked the empty urn, and now I know where the idol is. If Erinn and I both get the
immunity idol, that's a humongous alliance. It could probably rival anything that I have back at... at camp.
(squawking)
 When Joe comes back, he's going to have enough clues to find the idol in about 30 seconds.
 Right, so we need to put something in the tree mail ASAP.  I have some stuff. I have some feathers.
I have some leather straps.  That will be fine. I mean, anything that looks authentic.
When Joe comes back from Exile looking for the immunity idol, he'll have all the clues, so he'll know to look inside tree
mail, and I don't want him to know that I already have it, so I need to make the best-looking little fake idol that I can come
up with. I just went to pick up the real idol from Stephen's pants pocket just to know what it looks like
so I can make it look authentic and genuine. Hopefully, I'll be able to throw Joe off.
(chuckling)
 Yeah.
 Stephen and I was going fishing. So, I go to grab an empty bag, and right on top is the hidden
immunity idol.
Apparently, Taj found the idol. And I was like, "Oh, my God."
 I know it's right there! When J.T. found the idol, I was thinking what the heck do I say? So I said, "I know," and, you
know, I don't think I had the appropriate amount of shock on my face.
 Do you think she just now found it?  Yeah.
 Or that's good. I mean, I think she was just worried, you know, about the next vote, so wanted to make
sure we were all on board.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we-we got a hidden
immunity idol at camp.
 J.T.?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted to just talk to Taj
to tell her that J.T. found the idol in her bag. And she has to tell J.T. that she has it so the three of us
are on the same page.
 J.T. Look. I got you some puka berries.  Oh, I-I seen this a while
ago before I left.  Did you?  Yes.  How?
 I walked over here... That is beautiful.  Isn't it gorgeous?  That is beautiful.
It's a necklace, isn't it?  Yeah.  You got to hide it 'cause it might be...
 Where should I put it?  I can't believe it's the real immunity idol.  I know!
Honestly, I don't want you and Stephen to go out prematurely for no reason. If you need it, you can have it.
I'm serious.  All right. Taj showed me the idol. I think she felt like she could
trust me, and her sharing this information was huge. 'Cause Taj has just made a promise to me that any time that
I may need the hidden immunity idol, she would give it to me. So, that... I mean, that's big. That's a big promise, you know.
Hopefully, she'll keep it.
 Yeah.  Here. All right, now everybody give me theirs hands.
We're going to the merge.
 Yeah, we're going to the end. (gasping)  Taj just put herself, me, and Stephen in a really tight
alliance. It doesn't make me uncomfortable that they found the idol before Taj showed it to me.
It took her a little while to come around, but she was honest. And Stephen has been very honest with me, and I feel like I can
trust Stephen all the way. I just hope I'm not wrong.
♪ ♪  PROBST: Come on in, guys!
We'll now bring in Erinn and Joe returning from Exile Island.  Hey, Erinn. How was it?
You need a hug?  Welcome back.  (whispering): Missed you.  PROBST: Guys ready to get to
today's challenge?  Yeah.  PROBST: First things first: take back the immunity idol.
Thank you, Sierra. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each
tribe will use a slingshot in an attempt to break a tile... releasing sand from a tower. The emptying sand will cause the
next tile to be revealed and will release a bag of puzzle pieces from above. You'll retrieve the bag, move on
to the next tile. Once you've collected all three bags, two tribe members will use those pieces to solve the
puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, safe from Tribal Council, and guaranteed a
one-in-ten shot at winning the million bucks. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody from your tribe will be
voted out. Timbira, you have one extra member. Erinn sat out the last
challenge. Who's going to sit it out?  I will.  PROBST: Debbie, take a spot
on the bench. Everybody else, we'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started.
All right, here we go. J.T., the first shooter for Jalapao. Tyson, shooting for Timbira.
It is up to you if and when you want to change shooters. Survivors, ready? Go.
 Go, J.T.  PROBST: You got to break tiles. Oh, J.T. just misses.
Tyson just misses. J.T.'s all around it. Tyson connects dead center. That second tile is being
revealed. And there's the first bag for Timbira.  Good job, good job, Tys,
good job. All you, baby, all you. Good shooting, Tyson. Keep going.
 PROBST: Tyson going to keep shooting for Timbira.
J.T. connects, but not enough to break the tile.
J.T. connects for Jalapao. Sand starts pouring out. First bag releases for Jalapao.  Attaboy, Jet.
 PROBST: J.T.'s got to get it untied. He's got it.  I think I've got it.
 Okay, keep going, bro.  PROBST: J.T. going to keep shooting for Jalapao. That sand is still pouring out
slowly revealing the second tile.  Yeah, there you go.  PROBST: Tyson fractures the
second tile. J.T. connects with only half a tile to aim at.  Yes, Tyson.
 PROBST: Tyson connects. Sand pouring out of both of the second towers. Second bag releases for Jalapao.
 Good job, J.T.!  PROBST: J.T. has the second bag for Jalapao. Jalapao now in the lead.
 There we go! There we go!  PROBST: Second bag releases for Timbira.
 Good job, good job, Tys, good job.  Close.  PROBST: J.T. didn't
completely break those first two tiles, so not enough sand is leaking out, which means J.T.'s target on that third tile will
not get any larger than it is right now. It has been J.T. and Tyson all the way.
Nobody else has fired a shot. J.T. nicking at that tile.  Almost.  So close, buddy.
You got it, Jet.  Come on.  You got it, man. You got it. Come on.
One more.  Yes!  PROBST: Tyson connects.  Yes!
 PROBST: With a big break. Third bag releases for Timbira. J.T.'s got to pick it up, now.  Jet, you want to keep going?
 Yeah, I think I got it, Joe.  I'll come over and do it if you want.  PROBST: Timbira has their
third and final bag. Two people now working on the puzzle. Time to pick up the pace now.
Firing as fast as he can. Trying to get Jalapao back in this. Brendan and Erinn take their
time with a big lead on the puzzle.  Like that.  Oh, yeah, okay.
 Just keep trying all the different spots.  PROBST: J.T. continues to surround the tile with hits.
 Oh! Man!  Yeah!  PROBST: J.T. connects.
Now the sand starts to pour out. That'll do it.  Yes!  Yes, J.T.!
 PROBST: Jalapao's third bag is released. J.T. has it. Start working on the puzzle,
Jalapao.  Come on, Joe.  PROBST: Steven and Joe working on the puzzle for
Jalapao. Timbira has had a big head start, tough puzzle, still time. Jalapao could be right back in
this.  Nope. No, it doesn't fit.  Hold on, one more.
 That fits, there.  Okay.  PROBST: Brendan and Erinn slowly figuring out the puzzle.
 I got one.  PROBST: Joe with the first piece for Jalapao. Timbira thinks they have another
piece.  Hustle, hustle, guys.  There's two.  PROBST: Jalapao starting to
pick it up now.  Is that it?  Yep, yep, yep. Oh, look at that. Look at that.
 Fits.  No, keep trying.  That's it, okay.  There it is right here.
Right here.  Ooh.  No, that-that's it right there, and spin it.
Got it.  PROBST: Timbira thinks they have it. And they do.
Timbira wins immunity! (cheering)
 Oh, J.T., it's okay.  Don't beat yourself up.  PROBST: Timbira, congratulations.
Once again immunity is yours.  Thank you.  Awesome.  PROBST: What's it feel like
right now, Coach, knowing no chance I'm going home tonight?  It's incredible. And I really think that this was
so pivotal, this win, because it really shifts control of the game.  PROBST: Timbira, grab your
stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. Jalapao, I got nothing for you
except a date with me once again at Tribal Council, where one of you will be going home. Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.  It's not a good thing to go to Tribal Council.
I've been told by Joe I am safer than Taj, but you know, no one's safe at this point. And it really just sucks.
♪ ♪  Damn! I'm sorry, guys.  Man, I want to say nobody
blames you at all.  No, not at all.  It's hard not to.  Every challenge you're at,
you give your all, and like this time it didn't work out as well.  Are you all right, man?  Your leg looks bad.
It's red all the way down from the knee to the ankle.  Pretty painful.
This should be good, like, tomorrow.  Oh, man, that place sucks. What do you think?
 No way? You didn't?  I let her go first. I go, "I insist."
 She didn't show it to you?  I tried to juice her for info.  Nothing?
  Nada.  Wow, that's weird.  It was a long two days, man.  I need some water.
(laughing)  At Exile, Erinn gave me a scroll with five clues on it, and it was really easy.
I mean, I walked up and got the idol in literally ten seconds. This is the hidden immunity idol.
"Don't skirt the issue. Try lifting the veil. Here it is." I was stoked.
Just pure relief. Now I feel like I got a great shot at extra time in this game.
 Tonight, we are all voting for Taj. Joe made sure we were all on the same page, and that's that.
I think Taj knows something's up, but she's not someone who's trying to stab people behind their backs or trying to talk
crap right before we have Tribal Council. She's not that kind of person.  I don't believe I have
anything to worry about tonight at Tribal Council. I think I have Stephen and J.T.'s trust completely, and
plus I have the idol.  Yeah, it's perfect.  I think Sydney believes everything is going to work in
her favor because Joe is going to protect her, but I'm pretty confident tonight I'm not going. (laughs)
 Yeah.  Taj, myself, and Stephen have a tight alliance right now, and Taj has got the hidden immunity
idol that I could use. You know, that's just like my idol, and there's no way I could vote my hidden immunity idol out
of this game right now. He's gonna want to know why it's got to be Sydney and not Taj.  Whoo!
Oh, dude.  It feels good, don't it?  Yeah, man.
 We should at least talk about it.  I go to the water to talk with J.T. and Steve, and they
got this crazy look in their eye about keeping Taj. They started talking out all these plans that could happen,
but I kind of envisioned Taj being the odd man out and going home should we lose.
I need to try to honor that.
The three of us were not in any agreement on who to vote for tonight, and if J.T. and Steve-- they don't really give me
consideration, then I might hand over the idol to Sydney and make a point.
(thunder rumbles)
(Stephen sighs)
 We don't want that.  Uh-uh, and if we get rid of her, the idol's gone, too.  Well, that's not true.
 She gave it to you, didn't she? You have the idol. She told you to put it in your
pocket and keep it.  That means it's technically mine.  It's your idol right now.
 Yeah.
 I mean, that guarantees you and I have the idol. Oh, man, this is tough. I do believe Taj is comfortable
right now because she has a very strong alliance with Stephen and myself, but the idol is in Stephen and my possession
already, so I could vote Taj out right now, and we'll still have the idol. I have no idea what I'm doing.
I'm probably gonna decide when I get there. This is terrible. I'm going to hell.
♪ ♪
 PROBST: J.T., give me the state of affairs of this game right now. Where does it sit?
 Jeff, it ain't sitting real good for Jalapao right now. You know, we're down two members after tonight, and if there's a
merge, we're down and out.  PROBST: Stephen, how much time is spent talking about a possible merge?
 It's looming real large for us, and especially now that we're about to be down to four tribe members, you know, we're
all a little bit intimidated of what might happen.  PROBST: Joe, if you do merge, just based on numbers, you're in
trouble. So how much of tonight's vote is going to be made based on a possible merge?
 I would say the vote tonight is based on trust. To go into a merge, I want somebody who I know I can share
information with, they'll share information with me, and it won't leave outside that.  PROBST: Taj, is this a point
in the game where being on Exile so many days can work against you? You've spent so much time with
people from the other tribe, you could have the idol. You have a lot of potential weapons.
 Definitely, but I don't think it's a matter that they don't trust me. It's just the situations that
I've been in are distrustful.  PROBST: So if you guys were to merge, how are you going to help these other four people get
further in the game?  Well, I think that I will be able to create relationships on the other side with Timbira.
I've been on Exile with Sierra and Brendan, so I think I could probably talk them into maybe flipping over on our side.
I think I'd be valuable in that way.  PROBST: J.T., the flip side of what Taj is talking about is
she's made relationships. You haven't.  Exactly. I worry about that, too, Jeff,
you know. She could always fall in with them and start another alliance, and we'd still be sitting ducks.
 PROBST: Sydney, how about you? What do you bring that could help the rest of Jalapao if you
merge?  Well, I mean, it's not like I spent Exile time with a bunch of people from the other tribe, so
I definitely bring loyalty to these people.  PROBST: So you are the flip of Taj.
Taj is saying, "I have relationships. I will utilize them." You're saying, "I don't have any
relationships. I'm loyal to the tribe I was born into."  Yeah.
 PROBST: Joe, one of the advantages Timbira has with the numbers is they have options. Jalapao doesn't have any
options. If you guys don't stick together, you're in trouble.  That's why I feel it's so
important to go into the merge knowing that you at least have four, and you can't have any doubt that they're going to, you
know, do anything drastic and leave you.  PROBST: So dead set, know what you're doing tonight on the
vote?  Yeah, I'm ready to put pencil to paper.  PROBST: J.T., any questions
in your mind as we get ready to vote?  All afternoon, Jeff, and it's still going through my mind
right now. Here I am: I blew the challenge today, and I got to make a decision to send someone home.
It's a terrible situation for me to be in right now.  PROBST: Well, the time has come to make that decision.
It is time to vote. Joe, you're up.
 This is not an easy decision. Good luck.
 (whispering): Love you, girl.

 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sydney.
Taj. One vote Sydney; one vote Taj.
Taj. Two votes Taj; one vote Sydney.
Sydney. We're tied. Two votes Sydney; two votes Taj;
one vote left.
Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Sydney.  Ha.  PROBST: You need to bring me
your torch.
Sydney, the tribe has spoken.
Well, there was a lot of discussion tonight about a possible merge. If indeed you guys merge down
two members, you've got your work cut out for you. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on Survivor: (screaming)  Congratulations, tribe.
You have merged. (cheering)  If the old Timbira were to stay together, we can eliminate
them one by one by one.  We're going into this four on six. That's not good odds.
We're sitting ducks.
 I'm pissed I was voted off. Jalapao is in trouble if there's a merge. They are down the numbers, and I
don't really see anyone from Timbira switching over, but Taj might try to do something. It was a great experience, and
being able to look back on it and say that I got to do that is a blessing in itself, so I feel very lucky.
