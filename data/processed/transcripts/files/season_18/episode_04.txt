 PROBST: Previously on Survivor: This game is on. Timbira had the early advantage
when they outmaneuvered Jalapao in the game's opening moments.  We got all the water, we got all the beans, everything we
needed.  PROBST: And Timbira continued to dominate when they won the first immunity
challenge. Carolina, the tribe has spoken. At Exile Island, Taj and Brendan formed a secret
cross-tribal alliance... (Taj laughs) ...with plans to include Taj's Jalapao tribe mate Stephen and
Brendan's Timbira tribe mate Sierra. (thunder rumbles) (cheering)
Jalapao won the next immunity challenge, sending Timbira to Tribal Council. Candace, the tribe has spoken.
Jalapao wins immunity! Jalapao then went on to gain a clear advantage. Timbira, another tribe member
going home. Timbira tried to solve their problems by choosing a leader.  I think it should be Brendan.
 PROBST: Which angered Coach, who thought he was in charge.  I love to be the leader. That's what I'm used to doing.
 PROBST: Erinn disagreed.  I think it's a role that Coach is used to, but it's something that Brendan does
better.  PROBST: Erinn. Erinn's conflict with Coach almost got her voted out.
Third person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Jerry. But Jerry was sent home for being weakened by his illness...
The tribe has spoken. ...putting Timbira at six members to Jalapao's seven. Can Timbira put aside their
differences to make a comeback? 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
(Debbie sighs)  Uh, so at Tribal Council tonight, Erinn and I got into an argument about the leadership
on the tribe. And she said Brendan is a better leader. But she doesn't know what she's
talking about. It pissed me off, and it made me think Erinn's got to go because she is the cancer of the tribe.
She would have been voted out tonight, almost unanimously, had it not been for Jerry coming down sick.
 You guys, you want to do a powwow?
 I thought it was actually great last night that, like, Jeff brought it up.  I mean, we could have a
general leader.  If we all decide that Coach wants to do it or Tyson wants to do it, I'm totally on board.
So I think we just kind of all, just as a group, kind of decide what we think works best, and then just make that
decision and be done with it.  Right.  We need it. It's crazy.
It's crazy not to have it.  Last night at Tribal, we established a leader, kind of. So I guess Brendan or Coach is
the leader. I don't know. It's, uh... I wasn't paying attention.
I don't really care.  I think that... as much as I like leading, and, you know, if you were voted off tomorrow,
yeah, I'd gladly step into that role. But I think that, at the moment, everybody, including
myself, trusts you as being the leader. And as much as I would enjoy that role, we just have that one
person.  Yeah.  It's more productive.  Yeah.
 You know, if Brendan got voted off and I was the leader, I think this tribe would be better.
But I don't want to vote Brendan off because that's my M.O. I want iron that sharpens iron.
 And I didn't mean to sound last night like I was saying I don't think that you would be a good leader.
I think you would be a great leader.  There's only one experienced person out here as far as being
out in the outdoors, and that would be me. These people here are new kids on the block.
What they've been doing is not succeeding, not thriving, but existing. If you look at me, you look at
Brendan, who looks stronger? I do. We need to thrive in the wild and not just exist.
And I think the difference is is that I've been here, and they haven't. Captioning sponsored by

♪ ♪  When Taj goes to Exile, I think we're all concerned with how she's holding up.
It's definitely worn her down to be out there and to be out in the elements with no food, no water, nobody to trust.
So we're all concerned with the toll this is going to take on her in the long run.
 I am.  Brendan and I have our secret Exile alliance. So now I need to talk to
Stephen because I know I can trust him. He's kind of like the nerdy, shy guy who just wants to help
everybody, and I know that I can depend on him in the long run.  How you feeling?  This hammock feels lovely.
 Yeah?  Yeah.  You look quite relaxed in there.
 Thank you. When you get a second, I want to talk to you by yourself, okay?
 Yeah, absolutely.
(hooting)  All right, this is the deal. This is going to change your life, okay?
Do you want to be a part of the biggest upset on  Survivor history?  Yes, I do.
 Okay.
He's in an alliance with Sierra, and I told him about you. So the next...
 Taj apparently is aligned with Brendan and Sierra in the other tribe. They made a pact on Exile
Island to stick with each other, stay in the game as long as we can, and look out for each other once we get to the merge.
So I might have just stumbled ass-backwards into a huge alliance.  So the next time we go to a
challenge, if we win, we choose Sierra.  Okay.  Sierra's going to choose you.
 You're selling me Exile Island, isn't that tough?  It's not bad at all. (laughter)
I'm telling you... I will protect you. I will make sure you're fine. I just need you to roll with us.
 We got tree mail. It's a sandbag.  Oh, gosh!  "As time ticks away,
supplies start to dwindle. Your spirits may begin to corrode. For a boost in morale and
improvements at camp, you must know who can shoulder the load." (Coach laughs)  That means someone's going
to Exile for two days.  I just want to win the reward.  Yeah.
 Who do you want us to pick if we win? You want us to go with Taj again?
 I think we go Taj.  And then she's going to get to say you.  When Taj and I were on
Exile, we set up the Exile alliance-- me with Sierra, and Taj with Stephen. But I didn't communicate that I
had the alliance yet because I hadn't had a chance to talk to Sierra yet. So she doesn't know about the
plan, and it could be a pretty heinous situation.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! Jalapao getting your first look at the new Timbira tribe. Jerry voted out at the last
Tribal Council. Guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yeah!
 PROBST: For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will have a pole across their shoulders.
Each round, weight will be added to that pole. The decision about which tribe member gets the weight will be
made by two members of the other tribe. When the weight becomes too much, you'll drop your pole,
you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins reward for their tribe. Only rule in this challenge:
you must put two men and one woman as your weight bearers-- those holding the pole. Want to know what you're
playing for?  Yeah!  PROBST: Today, the reward is a camp raid.
The winning tribe will send two members over to the camp of the losing tribe, where you will be allowed to steal two items.
 Oh, my God.  PROBST: In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe to
go to Exile Island. That person will in turn select somebody from the winning tribe to join them.
Worth playing for?  Yeah!  PROBST: Because today's challenge only requires five
people, each tribe will sit people out. Timbira, you have one extra member.
Who you going to sit out?  Sierra.  PROBST: Jalapao, you're sitting out two people.
 Steve and I are sitting out.  PROBST: Stephen, Spencer, Sierra, take a spot on the sit-out bench.
Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, and we'll get started. All right, the weight bearers
for Jalapao: Joe, Taj, J.T. For Timbira: Debra, Brendan, and Tyson. Last person left standing wins
reward for their tribe. Let's get started. Jalapao, who you want to put the weight on first?
 Brendan.  Brendan.  PROBST: Timbira?  Joe.
 PROBST: Put the weight on. Each tribe will put the weight on their own tribe member to make sure it is placed evenly,
but the other tribe decides who actually gets it. Here we go. Three, two, one.
Put the weight on. Each bag weighs ten pounds. So each round, you are adding 20 pounds.
Next round. Timbira, who you want on?  J.T.  PROBST: J.T. getting some
weight.  Tyson.  PROBST: Tyson. Put it on.
Spreading the weight around. Here we go. Three, two, one. Release.
Jalapao, who you want to put it on? Brendan.  PROBST: Brendan getting more
weight.  Taj.  PROBST: Taj getting some weight. Put it on.
Brendan getting two more bags. That'll put him up to 40 pounds. Taj getting into on the action with her first 20 pounds.
This is about endurance and strategy. How long can you stand the weight?
Who do you give it to? ♪ ♪
Brendan now at 180 pounds. J.T. at 160, Tyson at 120. Joe at 140. Taj and Debra both holding
strong at 80 pounds. Next round.  Brendan.  PROBST: Brendan getting more
weight.  J.T.  PROBST: Puts J.T. at 180. This will put Brendan up to 200.
 Come on, man, come on.  PROBST: The record in this challenge: 220 pounds. Survivor: Pearl Islands:
a man with a beard, Rupert. Brendan is two bags away from that. Next round.
 J.T.  Brendan.  PROBST: Do it. J.T. and Brendan both getting
more weight.  Brendan's wobbling.  PROBST: This'll put Brendan up to 220.
 He's wobbling.  Whoo!  PROBST: Brendan drops out just as the weight goes on.
Brendan out of the challenge.  Whoa!  You got this. You got it, buddy. You got it.
Yes, J.T.  Come on, J.T.  PROBST: J.T. now at 200 pounds for Jalapao.
Timbira now down to Tyson and Debra to win it for them. Jalapao holding strong with all three tribe members still in it.
 Attaboy, Jet. You got this.  PROBST: Next round.  J.T.
 Tyson.  PROBST: This will put Tyson at 140 pounds. J.T. at 220 pounds.
 Damn, J.T., this is it.  Hold it, buddy, hold it.  This is a record, man.  PROBST: Three, two, one,
drop.  Attaboy. Attaboy, Jet.  Yeah! Whoo!
 Yeah, J.T.!  Strongest man alive!
 PROBST: Tyson drops out at 140.  As long as you can, Jet.  PROBST: Jalapao's strategy is
working. They've eliminated both men. Debra, the last remaining member of Timbira in this challenge.
 Yeah, J.T.  PROBST: J.T. drops out after holding 220 pounds, tying Rupert's record from the  Pearl
Islands. Joe at 140. Taj at 80. Joe drops out right behind J.T.!
 Taj, hang in there, baby.  Yeah!  PROBST: Suddenly, this challenge has come down to the
women.  All right, little mommy.  PROBST: Wow, just like that, this challenge has flipped on
its head. Jalapao had a huge lead and is now down to Taj for Jalapao...  It's all you, girl.
 PROBST: ...Debra for Timbira. Both women at 80 pounds. Let's put on some more weight. No choices to be made.
You know who's getting it.  That's just what we wanted to happen. You and her.
 PROBST: This will put both women at a hundred pounds. Here we go. Three, two, one.
Drop. Deborah at a hundred pounds. Taj at a hundred pounds.  Taj, you are solid, baby.
 We need you, T.  PROBST: Last person left standing wins reward, which is a camp raid.
Let's put on some more weight. Both women at a hundred pounds. Going to move it up to 120.  Come on, Tajie.
 Stay firm, T.  It's sliding. It's sliding.  Yeah! (cheering)
 PROBST: Debra drops out. Jalapao wins reward! (cheering)  That's all right, Debra.
You did a hell of a job, girl. You did a hell of a job. You did a hell of a job.  Thank you.
 Hey, that's all hard, baby. Good job.  PROBST: Jalapao with your fourth straight win in a row.
 Yeah.  PROBST: Nice job. Decision: who from Timbira are you going to send to Exile
Island?  Let's send Sierra. Let's see how she likes it.  Good 'cause I'm taking you.
 Oh, you witch!  PROBST: Sierra's picking Taj. All right.  That's all right.
I'm used to it now.  Today, I didn't have a chance to speak with Sierra before the challenge, so I'm glad she just
picked Taj, which was good. I hope Taj will be able to explain enough about the situation to hopefully work
things out.  We love you, Taj.  PROBST: Both Sierra and Taj will be back in time for the
next immunity challenge. Timbira, nothing for you. Head back to camp. Two members from Jalapao will
be showing up to do a little shopping.  Good job, you guys.  Good job.
 Good job.  You did awesome.  Nice.  Nice.
 Good job.  PROBST: Jalapao on your way back, choose two members to raid Timbira.
Grab your stuff. Head out.  Good job, baby.  My biggest concern when we
lost the challenge today is they're going to clean out our food supply, and then we're going to go downhill.
We're going to be nothing as a tribe in another three, four days with these people only eating rice.
 You guys did a great job today.  Yeah, you guys did so good.
 Yeah, totally.  Do you think they're going to take both bean bags or just one and one rice?
 But if they can take two things, we really don't have anything here of value besides the beans.
 Yes, we do. We have the water cans. We get back to camp and we know that there's two people on
their way over from Jalapao to raid our camp, take whatever they want. And we know they're after the
beans. So all we're thinking is what else could we convince them that they should take?
(applause)  Welcome to our abode.  Y'all got a pretty place here.
 Nice.  Hey!  Tyson, good job.  You, too, man.
 Good game, man.  It felt a little weird having those two guys from the other tribe come in.
 Could we get you a cocktail?  Yeah, if you don't mind.  You want to be on good terms with them 'cause you're probably
going to be living with them in the future, but in the back of your mind, you're like, "I want to punch these guys in the
head."  Well, maybe we could, uh, use a little way around the store, tell us which aisle it's on
or something.  All right.  Oh, no, you go find it.  We know y'all got some extra
food. We've been living on rice.  I'd be careful what you take. Just remember, you may end up
over here sometime.  Oh, I know. We're not going to leave you without food.
 You know we have watering cans over here. We hear you're boiling water.  We might as well just take
a sack of beans and something else.  That's what I'm thinking. Take that sack; leave this.
 Thanks.  We're not going to take the rest of their beans, so we might as well just take this.
I think it's a very smart idea not to take both sacks of beans because you have to look forward in this game.
There could be a switch at any time. And if I was to end up over there on the Timbira Tribe with
no beans 'cause I just stole both sacks, I'd be pissed.  Okay.  All right, y'all.
 Bye, Santa Claus.  We'll see you guys.  See you guys.  Thanks a lot.
 Thank you.
 Whoa! Hello!  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Welcome back.  It's good to be back, y'all.
 Who wants some beans?  Oh, my God! What do you got?  All right, so the real deal,
though, is they had two bags of beans.  Yeah.  One smaller bag...
 One, this is the bigger one.  You left their bag of beans?  We left a bag of beans.  We left their smaller bag.
 But why do you want to leave them food?  In case we switch or anything.
 Yeah.  They're probably thankful to you all that you just took a bag of beans.
 Oh, yeah. We didn't take nothing from them. They still got beans, and they
still got water containers. But, you know, there was nothing else to take.  You know, if they're thinking
strategy, I don't think it's the right strategy. You know, it's just, it's like you've got a hundred guns, let's
take 75 of them. You can have 25, oh, and maybe be able to take a shot at us.  Oh, my God.
This is the happiest day of my life.  Yeah.  Let's just pig out.
 What are they, pinto beans?  Mixture.  Yeah.  Oh, beans, just beans?
Black beans? White beans?  And pinto, I think.  They are farting beans. (Sandy laughing)
They are farting beans, honey.  Sandy's kind of starting to get on my nerves, as crazy as she is.
She repeats everything at least three times. And it's starting to, I think, wear on everybody, and not just
me.  I did! You are always...  I'm going to smack you.  No, isn't that true?
It's always, I'm the one that's like, "Oh, no," this, that and the other, and there you go. But, anyway, y'all just do
whatever you want.  Oh, wow. Look at this.  Thank the Lord for the beans.
 If I were choosing who was leaving this tribe next... it would be Sydney. Sydney is using everything she
has from head to toe to enchant every one of the boys.
She runs around in their boxers and then, you know, doesn't sleep in her bra at night. And she is, like, up against
the boys 24/7. Trust me, she's playing this game hard and, uh, it's working. Oh, they love her to death.
I still think they can see through it, but they still like the package, you know? They're going to put your name
down there, you better do something. You better be pulling off more than a bra.
You better be pulling some panties off or something. (laughing) Oh, you know, so I might have to
trick her that way. (laughs) If I can't outwit her with the body, I'll outwit her with the
brain.
 All right, choose an urn.  See if it has anything in it. Usually, one of them does; one of them doesn't.
Nothing's in there? Yup, I got the clue. Open in private. All right, I'll be right back.
"Every day or two, you get mail from this place. If you find it round here, you'll ask, 'Why the long
face?'" Tree mail, I knew it. I knew it was the tree mail.  Once Sierra and I arrived at
Exile, we chose urns, and I got lucky and chose the one with the clue in it. It's exactly where I thought it
would be. It's back at my home camp at tree mail. When Brendan got back, he didn't
didn't talk to you about himself at all?  No.  Not one second?
Hmm... okay. I was kind of talking to Sierra down the road, trying to see where her head was at, and,
apparently, Brendan had never had a chance to fill her in on the plan. So I'll have to fill her in on
everything. Okay, well, here's the deal. No one knows that you and Brendan are cool on your side,
and no one knows that Steve and I are cool on my side. Once we get the two idols, we basically have security through
the merge. And once we get to the merge, we'll have a secret four-way alliance that no one knows about
and can't break up. This way, we can watch each others' backs when somebody's trying to blindside one of us.
We can warn them. We can take other people out without them even knowing it.  This is awesome.
This is an absolutely amazing plan. It just feels great that I built an alliance with Brendan,
that I chose the right person who was smart enough to form an alliance to create this awesome foursome, ruling all the idols.
I started at the bottom of the food chain. I climbed my way to the middle, and now I'm at the top, baby.
 Our concern is getting to the final four, which will be you, me, Steve, and Brendan. Are you game?
 I'm game, game.  Rock on.  I'm game.  All right.
Team Secret is in place.  It's amazing.  Is there anything that we should do today?
 Hmm... rest? Eat, drink, and be merry.  That sounds great.  Yeah.
 I'd love to do that.  I've been laying in the water.  Today is just a relaxation,
fun day. We're just kind of enjoying not having a lot of work to do. We needed to play, laugh, and
have a little bit of fun because if you start getting down out here, all the different doors start opening: I miss my
family; I miss my husband; I miss my children. You know, and so we've got to keep each other up.
 I'm going tribal all over everybody's asses.  Dude, this is insane, man.  Oh, my God!
 This is insane!  Look at how ripe a tan I'm going to get on my ass cheeks now.
I made this myself.  You are the man. This is hilarious.  Imagine if I single-handedly
bring the loincloth back to civilized society. (laughing)  I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.  I said a-bunga, unga-bunga, unga-bunga, unga-bunga. (laughing)
 Oh, my God!  I don't know what it is, but I'm having a tough time finding a connection with these people.
Before I came out here, I went through a really terrible breakup. I can't even carry on normal
conversations with people anymore. It makes it hard to talk about everything because it's going
to come up, and I don't... (voice breaking): This is what happens when it comes up. And I don't want to do this out
here.  For the most part, I've written Erinn off. I mean, I haven't really talked
to her one-on-one about anything. And she doesn't hang out with the tribe a lot.
Plus, I think she'll be really, really upset when she gets voted off, and I'd like to see a freak-out at Tribal.
I think that'll be fun.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Taj and Sierra, returning from Exile Island.
 Come on in, girl.  We missed you, sweetie.  Missed you.  Thank you.
 PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yeah!  PROBST: All right, first
things first. Give it up, Sydney.  All right, all right.  PROBST: Let's get to today's
challenge. One tribe member at a time will race out, retrieve a puzzle piece... race back.
Then, the next person goes. Once you've collected all eight pieces, you must place them in their correct spot in the frame
and rotate them to reveal the winning phrase. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, is safe at least
one more day in this game. Losers go to Tribal Council. Another person will be voted out.
Jalapao, you have one extra member for this challenge. Who's sitting out this one?  I can't run.
 You can't run.  Let her sit out.  Taj is sitting out.  PROBST: Taj will take a spot
on the bench. Everybody else, we'll get started. Here we go.
For immunity, survivors ready? Go!
You must untie. Then, the piece will drop; then you unclip it and race back.  Yeah, Joe!
 Come on! Whoo!  Good, Joe! Nice!  Joe-Joe!
 PROBST: J.T. on the course for Jalapao. Erinn now on the course for Timbira.
 Come on, J.T.!  PROBST: J.T. whips through those knots. He's heading back now with
Jalapao's second puzzle piece. Erinn has hers down quickly. Spencer on the course.  Take your time, Erinn!
 PROBST: Brendan now out on the course for Timbira. Spencer has the third piece.  Yeah, Spencer!
 PROBST: Brendan heading back for Timbira.  Come on, Brendan!  Let's go, Spence!
 Yeah, Spence.  PROBST: Stephen now out on the course for Jalapao.  Good job, Brendan!
Good job, Brendan.  PROBST: Tyson out on the course.  Let's go, Steve-o!
 Yeah, Stephen!  PROBST: Stephen has the fourth piece for Jalapao. He's heading back, rope and all.
Tyson makes very fast work of his knots. Sandy now out on the course for Jalapao.
Sierra now out on the course. Both tribes are halfway there. Four pieces left.  Go, Sandy!
Go, Sandy! Whoo! Go, Sandy!  PROBST: Jalapao still with a slight advantage over Timbira.
 Go, Sandy!  PROBST: Sydney out on the course for Jalapao. Debra out on the course for
Timbira. Three pieces left.  All right, Syd, kill this!  Good job, Debbie!
 PROBST: Sydney really struggling with her knots.  She's making me nauseous. Sydney, come on.
 PROBST: Timbira now in the lead. Brendan back out on the course for Timbira.
Sydney sprinting back. Joe back out on the course again.  Come on, Joe-Joe!
Come on, Joe-Joe!  PROBST: Brendan through his knots quickly.  All right, Joe!
 PROBST: Joe unclips.  Go get them.  PROBST: Tyson heading out for the final piece for Timbira.
 Yeah, Joe. Good job.  PROBST: J.T. on the course for final piece for Jalapao.
Tyson has the last puzzle piece for Timbira.  Good job, Tyson!  PROBST: J.T. made up a lot of
time. J.T. has the last piece for Jalapao.  J.T.! Whoo!
 PROBST: Timbira, start working on your puzzle. Jalapao, start working on your puzzle.
 Look out. Look out.  PROBST: There are two elements to this puzzle. You have to make sure each
piece is in the correct spot. Then, you have to rotate it to the correct side... to find the winning phrase.
Second chance you guys have had to work together on a word puzzle.  Oh, okay, guys.
 PROBST: Timbira froze the last time we did this.  No, I think "win" or "immunity" is wrong.
It's to confuse us. It doesn't make any sense to have a freakin' phrase that ends with "win" or "immunity."
 Right, you're right. You're right.  PROBST: There are lots of phrases that are almost right.
 ...your tribe wins. Your tribe wins...  PROBST: Only one that is absolutely right.
 Do we see "Timbira" anywhere?  "Escaped." "Jalapao." "Tribal."
"Council." "Immunity."  Yes.  That's it!
 No, it's not.  "Escape the vote." Let's get it. Go back. "Escape the vote."
 This one, this one, this one.  Grab it.  This one right here.  Oh, my God!
 Switch this one! (cheering)  We need somebody.  PROBST: Timbira thinks they
have it. "Escape the vote. Timbira wins immunity." Timbira does win immunity.
(cheering)  Yeah!
 PROBST: Timbira, congratulations.  Yes! Yes!
 PROBST: No Tribal Council tonight. Nobody else from your tribe going home.
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off.  Thank you.
 PROBST: Tough Tribal tonight, J.T.?  Very tough, Jeff. We've become one group here,
one tribe. Nobody wants to go home. Nobody wants to vote anybody else home, so it's going to be
real tough.  PROBST: Unfortunately, somebody is going home. And after tonight's vote, both
tribes will be even again. I will see you at Tribal.  The challenge was something that we took as our big
opportunity to gain numbers in this game, and hold them for a long time. But right now, we're going to
go back to six on six. So it was just, overall, very frustrating.
 We see all these words, but it's just like there is no rhyme or reason. God, it was just so random.
 I think it's the curse of the beans.
 I was not surprised that we lost because we went on a four-challenge winning streak, so I definitely thought that it
was coming. I just need to cool off. I'm so dehydrated. Sierra and I found the last
clue for the idol. I know exactly where it is. I'll talk to Stephen as soon as I get a second, but right now,
we need to focus on Tribal Council.
 I mean, honestly, I'm kind of glad, though.
Not someone, but... Someone... her names rhymes with "Andy." (Sydney laughs)
 Oh, Lord. So what are we going to do tonight, y'all?  What do y'all think?
 Oh, God...  I don't know. I know I don't want to go home.  I don't want to go home.
 I'd also like not to go home.  Honestly, I'm going to put this out there. I think Sandy was stronger than
Sydney in the last two competitions, honestly.  The problem if we eliminate Sydney, Spencer and Joe both
are going to be...  They're going to turn on us.  Has she been really, like, the catalyst in the challenges?
 You know, she's strong. She's not that strong in challenges, you're right. I mean, she's, you know, a nice
presence around camp. She works hard. She works hard around camp.  Yeah, yeah, we do.
 I've got mixed emotions. I don't feel bad and I don't feel good, you know? Taj is leaning towards Sydney,
and she said I'm doing better in the challenges, actually, than Sydney, but we'll see. I think maybe J.T. and them are
telling me the truth and I'm going to be here tomorrow.  It's up to y'all. Just let me and know I'll do
whatever y'all want me to do.  I will. The important thing is now is figuring out am I going to send
Sandy home or am I going to send Sydney home? I have a big dilemma right now. I'm not sure what I want to do.
 I was excited to meet other people who I would never get a chance to meet. And also just to see how I
would like, fare.
 I like the sneakiness of it, too, 'cause I'm not very sneaky back home, you know? So you get to be sneaky in a
new environment.  Oh, really?  So you're being sneaky? That's interesting.
 Yeah, I'm glad you told me that.  That's good information.  All of y'all are sneaky, too,
so don't even start with me.  Sydney's good looks make a positive first impression, but that could be, you know, part
of her devious personality. If there's a merge coming up, we need strong members, but we also need loyal members, so
getting rid of Sydney could make a lot of sense.
 As far I know, the vote's going to be going on to Sandy K. tonight. I feel like I've tried to get
on the good sides of people, so, hopefully, it's not me. But then again, it's  Survivor. So, you know, everyone wants to
win. So we'll see.
 PROBST: Sandy, going back to day one, you were out of this game. Here we are on day 12, you're
still sitting pretty. Have you recovered from that first impression?  I believe I did recover.
I fit in with this gang quite well, given the fact that, uh, you know, I'm the older woman. So, yeah, it makes me feel good.
Believe me.  PROBST: J.T., how did Sandy recover from such an awful start?
 Well, Sandy's kind of the mother of the crowd. She takes care of us and frees us up to do the hard work.
 PROBST: Sandy, do you spend any time at all reflecting on your age when you're spending so much time with people that
are considerably younger and relatively speaking, a good-looking group of people?  Yes, the old age factor
plays a part in that, but, you know, I bring them a lot of laughs and so forth. But I think people might use
their, maybe, a little bit of their beauty or their body, you know? I've seen a little bit of
flirting going on as far as Sydney is concerned, you know? Maybe wearing the boxer shorts of J.T., you know.
 PROBST: J.T., is she wearing your boxers?  Yeah, Jeff, she's wearing my boxers.
 It's hot out there. I don't have shorts. I'm wearing jeans.  PROBST: Nobody asked you to
defend.  I know, that's all I'm saying though.  PROBST: Joe, do you see that
going on?  Yeah. Yeah, I see flirting going on.  PROBST: Stephen, fair part
of the game? If you're a young, beautiful woman, why not try to use it to influence the guys?
 First of all, I should say that the big flirting relationship has not been mentioned yet, which is between
Sydney and Joe. They flirt maybe a little more than J.T. and Sydney flirt.  PROBST: Sydney, you were
nodding your head and smiling.  Yeah, I mean, I have a flirtatious personality. I flirt with women.
I definitely flirt with Joe. He's a great guy. I get along with him really well.
It's just inevitable for me, I think.  PROBST: Taj, how's that sit with you?
 First of all, let's just say Sydney is gorgeous. So men are definitely going to be attracted to her,
regardless. They can't help themselves. So if there's an alliance, it would be with her and not me
because she probably what they want to align with anyway. And that's okay because I'll make my way through the game
regardless.  PROBST: Hold on. "That's okay"?  It's okay with me, oh, yeah.
 PROBST: I don't buy that for a second.  I have to accept the fact that they are attracted to her.
They're not attracted to me. That's okay with me. I'll be all right with or without their attraction.
 PROBST: Sydney, does this happen to you a lot? Conversations end up revolving around your looks?
 Yeah, it happens a lot. My profession is a model, you know? So people stereotype me as the
blonde girl who doesn't have a lot to stay and sits there and be pretty. But, that doesn't mean, like...
I don't know. It's hard to explain.  PROBST: Stephen, could that work against Sydney?
 Definitely. I mean, someone could think, "Oh, she's just a flirt; she's nothing," and just undervalue
her throughout the game.  PROBST: Sandy, how will this tribe be different tomorrow?  I think there might be a
person or two upset, depending on the outcome. I imagine there'll be a couple of real upsets.
So tomorrow will tell the story.  PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote. Joe, you're up.
 It's just your time to go.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave Tribal Council
area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Sandy. Sydney.
One vote Sandy; one vote Sydney. Joe. One vote Sandy; one vote Sydney;
one vote Joe. Sandy. That's two votes Sandy; one vote Sydney; one vote Joe.
Sandy.  Oh, boy.  PROBST: That's three votes Sandy; one vote Sydney;
one vote Joe. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Sandy. That's four.
That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
Sandy, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Well, after tonight's vote, both tribes are even: six-six. Brand-new game. Grab your torches.

 PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on Survivor:  Once we make it to the merge, it's smooth sailing.
 PROBST: The secret cross-Tribal alliance might not be so secret.
 And I'm sick of this game.  PROBST: And Taj acts out.  Everybody can kiss my ass.  Moves like that will get you
voted off.  I'm hot today.
 I was slung out, you know, right off the bat, the first day without anybody knowing me or anything.
And then I kind of got in with them. I was like the mother, uh, mother hen over all these little
ducks. And I stayed around a lot longer than I thought I was going to.
And, uh, I didn't quit. So I'm real proud of myself.
