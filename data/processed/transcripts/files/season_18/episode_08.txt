 PROBST: Previously on Survivor: Coach and Brendan struggled for control of Timbira.
 As much as I like leading, everybody trusts you as being the leader. If Brendan got voted off, and I
was the leader, I think this tribe would be better.  PROBST: And Tyson chose sides.
 PROBST: Launch. Jalapao took a beating. J.T. has lost a tooth.  Oh!
 PROBST: And they lost their third immunity challenge in a row. Timbira wins immunity!
Brendan was saved from Tyson and Coach. At Jalapao, with Tribal Council looming, and Taj and Stephen in
control of the hidden immunity idol, Taj reached out to J.T.  Listen, I can't believe it's the real immunity idol.
 I know. Honestly, I don't want you and Stephen to go out prematurely.  PROBST: At Tribal Council,
the three stuck together. Sydney, the tribe has spoken. Down four members to Timbira's six, Jalapao became a desperate
tribe. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 At Tribal Council, Sydney was voted out. It's bittersweet. I felt bad that she had to go,
but one of us had to go, and I'm glad it's not me.  After tonight's vote, I feel like the odd man out.
Luckily, I wasn't, you know, the one being voted out. So, you get a little nervous. You get a little concerned when
you see torch after torch getting put out. You know, it's not fun. It's not fun to lose.
It's not fun to vote people you like home.
 Maybe it will change. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION

(thunder crackling)  Do you see Coach out there?  Yeah.  He's meditating.
 He's doing his morning meditation.  We're almost at day 20. Up till now, it's been about the
team. So I've been trying to get along, but the little annoying things I've had to keep bottled
in. I'm the kind of person that if I see it, I want to say, I want to nail it, get rid of it.
And I was, like, you know what? I need to get centered. I need to pray. I need to meditate.
And I spent about ten minutes out in the water just getting refocused, and it was, like, boom, and everything just
clicked. You know? This is about me now.
 Oh, that feels so good.  We're so close to a merge. Could be today, could be three days.
So I've been pacifying everybody and getting along with the tribe.  Oh, my God!
That's awesome. Coach has a new thing: his morning meditation. Just hanging out in the water.
A little bit of this going on every morning. If that's the thing that turned you into Mr. Nice Guy around
camp, you do it every day. I will take you down there, hold your hand, push you in the water, whatever needs to happen,
because I like New Coach.
 What will today bring?  What do you mean by that?  Huh?  Competition?
 No. You're like a totally different person now.  Life is good.
 My relationship with Coach to me has been good the whole time. There's definitely been some
things he's done around camp which are kind of annoying or outside the box. And I mean, he's always...
doing his hair, and we were talking about it, and it's like, "I kind of started the samurai thing."
And I was, like, "Started the samurai thing?" Like, they've been doing it for, like, thousand of years in
Japan, and Johnny Depp's been doing it for, like, 20 years here. You didn't start anything.
 It's like a knot.  I know. Feel it.  Oh.
 Feel how hot it is.  Yeah. Oh, shoot. Yeah.
 It was all the way out here yesterday, and now it's just right there, so...  What got into it that made
it... got it infected?  A little bug?  A bug?  Like, a little, you know,
bacteria or parasite.  Phew! The only thing that concerns me about Joe right now is his leg.
His leg is very swollen and red from the knee down. It doesn't look good to me. He swears that it's getting
better, but I don't know. With these two eyes, they don't look too good to me.
 I'm gonna post up in the hammock for a bit, man.  Joe has a... kind of a bummed-up leg, and he's down and
out, and, you know, um, if there is a merge, even if there isn't a merge, we're still... Jalapao is still down to four
members, and things are really not looking our way. So there's a lot at stake for every one of us if we want a
shot in this game, and this is definitely the biggest challenge yet.
 Well, did we get tree mail?  So...?  Let's read it.  Coach, your hair tie.
One for you.  I'll have this.  "Head to head, face to face, here's another to get your heads
spinning. Getting away from camp and a feast is what you'll end up winning."
 "Here's another to get your heads spinning."  Spinning.  "Here's another to get your
heads spinning. Getting away from camp..."  BOTH: "And a feast."  "Is what you'll end up
winning?"  Oh! Oh!  It could be a merge.
It could be a merge.  Oh!  Merge. It could be a merge.  I just want it to say,
"Let's go eat." Whoever wins this challenge today-- they apparently, get this huge feast, and I get
excited when I hear anything that starts with an "F." (laughs)  Y'all, we got to win a feast.
 I think it's a merge.  I think it's a reward challenge.  Let's take bets.
I'll eat your parts of the feast if it's a merge.  No. I'm not sharing mine.  No. Let's just win whatever
it is.  Whatever it is, we'll win.  I'm real hard on myself when I lose.
I hate losing. I'm a sore loser. So, if it's a merge, ball game's on.
That's the reason maybe I'm kind of hoping it's a challenge. I don't know if I'm ready yet, but, uh, I feel like I got to
redeem myself. It's really fixing to hit the fan.
 Oh, wow, dude! (cheering)  There's candy! (cheering)
 Give me some water without bugs in it!  J.T., you have a sultry voice; you do the honors.
 Let's hear it, big guy.  "Congratulations, tribes. You have merged." (all cheering)
"...Replace your old buffs with the new.  I love the green.  "You must come up with a new
tribe name, design a new tribe flag and begin the next phase of your adventure. You will all live at the old
Timbira camp.  All right!  "All of your personal reward items will be at your new camp
when you arrive. Good luck. Enjoy your feast."  Yeah! (cheering)
 Let's eat!  Pig out, man!  Our biggest hope was that today was the merge feast.
Less the merge than the merge feast. Jalapao is freaking hungry.  Those are real good.
 Those are real good!  I was going crazy!  Yeah, Tyson's kind of like a girl.
 A toast?  Yeah.  Here's to  Survivor  and all of us for making it, trying our
hardest and the merge. Hear, hear!  Hear, hear!  Clink, clink, clink!
 The feast, man, was cool because we're meeting new people. You know, it's like getting
a new girlfriend. There's all kinds of things to explore. (screaming)
I just wish we could have decimated the tribe a little bit more. We had them on the ropes.
They were going to go down and I think we could have won the rest of them. But it's all good.
We're in control, baby. We're in control. We can be in control for the rest of the way.
 So, anybody got any history, secrets, and stuff? I don't have nothing. I'm a poor cattle farmer.
 And you're a rocket scientist, though.  Yeah, I am a rocket scientist.
 What do y'all... what do you do?  I'm a soccer coach, but also a symphony conductor in
California.  Symphony instructor?  Conductor, I'm a  maestro. So I do... I have two jobs.
I fly back and forth between the two. I like J.T., man. He's a warrior.
I'm looking forward to getting to know him. And Stephen, I mean, he's obviously intelligent and as
long as... I mean, I look forward to these individual immunity challenges, especially in the beginning when we've got
all the big horses and alpha males together. That's gonna be awesome.  We need a new tribe name,
you guys.  Anybody know Portuguese?  I looked up "Will to Overcome" and that was  dingus,
I guess, d-i-n-g-u-s.  In Portuguese?  Yeah.  I don't know about dingus,
man; I mean, that sounds like a good meaning, but dingus sounds a little bit too crazy.  I can't hear Jeff saying,
"Come on in, Dingus."  I'm in!  I think it has a nice ring to it.
 Any other suggestions?  Forza. F-o-r-z-a is like strength in Portuguese.
 Forza.  Forza, which means strength.  Easy to say. It took us, like, three days to
get Jalapao down.  I know it's a touchy subject, but if we don't want to talk about it now, that's fine.
We're just shocked by the last two votes.
 Good.  Yeah.  So, you guys didn't come up with the idea of who was going
home? It was kind of just, like, off the cuff?  It was so... it was so big.
I don't know. It's hard to talk about 'cause it was so big, you know?  I was sort of tiptoeing
around Sierra because you do need to be discreet with how much information you give out. You know, these are your future
competitors, so you can't just be giving away your entire tribe dynamic.  You guys are all great
competitors, and it's been a lot of fun, you know, competing against you.  So are you guys.
 And when you guys win, I think we all appreciate, you know, definitely how well you've done.
 Well, thanks.  I was really worried about the merge because traditionally, if you're
outnumbered four to six going into a merge, you're sitting ducks.  Y'all got some fishing holes.
 You've got to catch us fish. We have not eaten a fish yet.  Fish man right there.  I'm really worried about
the numbers. I hope that there's a power struggle in the old Timbira and I can exploit that.
Going into this four on six, that's not good odds.
 Welcome to your new house.  Thanks.  Look at that umbrella. Look at all the pots we got.
 Awesome.  Oh, my God!  Let's put that tarp out, like right away.
 It's like a real fixer-upper.  Hey, guys. It's raining. Let's put the tarp up.
 Oh, my God.  I'm soaking wet.  That tarp is only as big as that one spot right there.
 You know, we're walking into the old Timbira camp, and first of all, we come up to a little dog house shelter, and I'm like,
"What is this?" You know, I mean, I don't know how it was still standing.  We should take this top off,
just start pulling everything off and then just rebuild it. Not rebuild necessarily the bottom, but take the top off,
just pull it all off, and then just start from scratch.  You guys, should we do a tour and show everybody the back
beach and the front beach and all that before... so they have kind of a feeling of the camp?  Yeah.
 We got a pot full of beans out there that's about half cooked.  Let's see the tour.
 The Timbira people are definitely running the show. It's definitely intimidating to go into the merge down in
numbers. They can pick us off if they want, you know. We're dependent on their good
graces. So, even if we make allies with them, those allies are in the dominant position.
 It's not near as big as you'd think, is it?
You fish much?  Yeah, I do, uh... I do mainly fly-fishing. It's just, uh... I like the art
of... of the cast. But, uh... I'm by no means an expert. (laughing)
 You see them jumping at it?  I see. I felt it as soon as I put it in there, man.
I knew the first time that I... that I looked at J.T.-- I saw the cowboy boots, open, honest face, and I said to myself,
"He is a good old boy." We're kindred spirits. We both love the outdoors. I think that we're both
warriors. Let's talk about the game a little bit while we're fishing, man.
How about it?  Man, I'm... I'm up for anything, man. It's not even 15 minutes, and
Coach is ready to talk about the game. And it was perfect. I mean, I was... I couldn't wait
to talk to him about the game. From what I know, Brendan thinks he's in control of the game pretty much.
 Who told you that?  Taj. I'm 95% sure he's got the idol.  So, you swear to me that Taj
does not have it.  I don't know if she's got it or not. If she does, there's two idols.
 That's crazy. All right, I'm going to tell you a couple of things. Um, when we talk, for now, let's
keep it confidential.  100%, dude.  Just between you and I. I said in the very beginning of
this game to everybody, I will not lie one time on this game, so let's just keep it honest between us.
Let's keep it real.  I'll keep it real, Coach. I've seen cracks right away. I had some ideas before I
ever... before there ever was a merge. It's hard to keep six people from different walks of life to
stick together when they hate each other. So, I'm just here to make sure everybody hates each other.
If Brendan... if Brendan has got that idol, we got... we're going to have to blindside him.  I have a lot of emotions
going on. I have said that I felt Brendan was maybe a little bit squirrelly, but if you flat out
lied to me, you better be prepared to go to war.
I talked to J.T.  Mm-hmm.  And the reason why I did is because I told you in the very
beginning, you know, that he and I had, like, this rapport...  Mm-hmm.  ...without talking.
I know him; he's a good old boy. Well, check this out. Brendan has the idol.  I thought so.
 I want you to think about an alliance with Stephen and J.T.  Here's what we do. Me, you, J.T., Stephen, Debbie.
We keep that five, we can take it.  It's time to go for the jugular.
Brendan is the head of the dragon. When you want to defeat the army, you cut off the head of
the dragon. For him to go out as the first person from the merge... Mm, yes, I love it.
I mean, that's awesome.
 Oh, good. All right. We've definitely found inroads into Timbira.
This is clearly a very fractured tribe because there's no strong bonds and sense of place, so there's a lot of power dynamics
at play that are very easy to exploit.
 Yeah.
(laughing)
 I want you to catch one.  Okay.  Just put it out as far as it can reach.
 Should I keep bringing it out and...  No, you can leave it in there.
Unless the... took it off already.  I got one, dude.  Huh, pull it up.
Pull it in. Oh, it's a little baby catfish. Pull him all the way in. Catfish-- let me tell ya, they
got little fins that are, they supposedly poisonous.  Oh, really?  See, he's got little razors
on the back of them fins. See, watch him close them down on me.  I was hoping for a big one.
 Ow. Look at this. What kind of catfish is this?  (laughs) I don't know! A dangerous one?
 It is. I'll put him back. That little bastard. ...right there.
I expected to not get along with Tyson at all. We talked a lot of smack at each other, pushed each other
around, and now, you know, when you get on the same tribe and you go for individual immunity, you're still competing against
the guy, but you're living with him. It's a little different now. Stephen's the only guy that I
can vouch for 100%. You know, so...  And with me it's Coach, and as far as...
 That's what Coach told me. Whatever y'all wanna do, I'm with y'all.  'Cause I was thinking of
getting rid of Brendan like, since, like, two or three eliminations ago.  He's gonna be surprised as
hell.  I'm one of the guys that...  I'd like to get rid of Brendan.
He's the biggest threat. He just seems like a sneaky bastard, you know. I can't look him in the eye
and believe a word he says. You can look me in my sweet blue eyes all day and I'll tell you sweet nothings and you'll
believe all of them.
Debbie, you want to go, uh, grab some firewood? Do you think we need some?  Sure.
We'll go grab some of the timber and logs, yeah.  I'll grab that log on that back beach, at least.
 After the two tribes merged, I was thinking we're probably safe, Stephen and myself, because of the secret alliance
that we have between us and Brendan and Sierra. But they haven't even made any signs or signals, so, it kind
of, it makes me think that they're going to stick behind their tribe right now. I went into Exile with Brendan
three times.  What do you think is going on?  I don't know.
I don't know. I can't tell if he's still with us or not. I can't tell at all.
I just, I feel like he's not doing the things that he was saying he was going to do before.
 My Exile alliance with Taj, Sierra, and Stephen is still kind of laying low, which is what I think it needs to do
because that alliance is only effective once the numbers get down to seven or eight. And so, right now, Joe needs to
go, J.T. needs to go, and then my Exile alliance can kind of take charge if need be.  Coach talked with J.T.
last night really good.  Okay.  J.T.'s a straight shooter, good guy.
 Okay.  He said he trusted Stephen with all his life.  Okay.
 Here's the alliance now. You, me, Coach, J.T., Stephen.  I like J.T. and Stephen both.  They're both...
 Straight shooters.  Here he comes.  Okay.  Wood?
 Do you think Joe?  Yeah, I think so. What do you think?  That's what I thought.
I mean, he's injured, so he's not going to be able to compete at stuff, don't you think?  Um, yeah.
 I was going to go grab that log because it was easy, but... and it burned long, but if not, we'll just, where should we go?
Anywhere?  We don't have much time.  Yeah, we only need the little stuff.
 I talked with Brendan, and, uh, I just wanted to kind of let him feel like that I was still on board with whatever
plan he had. I do feel proud being a better schemer than Brendan. He's supposed to be this
big-league businessman who gets businesses rolling, makes them tons of money. He's like putty in my hands.
I can mold this game however I I want right now.  Okay, first of all, did you find yours?
 Found it?  Uh-huh?  I got to get back to camp. (laughing)
 Based on the clues from Exile, I was able to figure out that there were most likely two idols, and Joe and I decided
that we were going to work together and see if we can maybe find both.  So, you don't know where it
is?  Oh, no, not at all.  I can't even trust you. (giggling)
I don't know what you're doing. It's a simple question. I'm asking if you have the immunity idol.
 I don't have it. We're here.  You know where it is? You bend over.
 Yeah.  Do this.  Yeah.  It's not there.
 It's not there anymore.  The idol is not there.  Yeah. There was a very specific
pocket where something should have been on the back of that tree mail post. There's nothing in there.
So, we can assume that Brendan or Sierra has the idol. We'll vote them both out and, uh, then we can actually play
the game for real.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing?  Awesome.  Great.
 PROBST: J.T., what's the name of the new tribe?  Forza.  PROBST: What's Forza mean?
 I believe it means "strength" in Portuguese.  PROBST: All right, Forza is the new tribe name.
You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yep.  Yeah.
 PROBST: All right, first things first, Debra: I will take tribal immunity back. Tribal immunity, no more.
We're now in the individual portion of the game. This is what you covet. A beautiful individual immunity
necklace. If you're wearing this, you're safe in this game. Cannot be voted out.
If you don't have immunity, you are vulnerable. Today's challenge is very simple.
Each of you will hold on to a pole for as long as you can.  Oh, man.  PROBST: When you fall off the
pole, you're out of the challenge. Last person left hanging on the pole wins immunity, is safe at
least one more day in this game. Losers, Tribal Council, where one of you will be voted out. Big stakes.
We'll draw for spots and get started.
This challenge is officially on.
 I love you, pole.
 PROBST: Stephen struggling early.  I've got a lot of limbs here, Jeff.
 More than the rest of us?  PROBST: Joe, now struggling.
 I know. Salvaged.  PROBST: Joe really struggling.
Finds a new resting spot. Stephen struggling to hang on. Stephen is the first one out of the challenge.
Take a spot on the bench. Joe now, starting to slip down his pole. Joe struggling to hang on.
That wood raking against the chest. Joe is out of the challenge. (frustrated yell)
 PROBST: Wow, what is going on with that?  Uh, it's infect... My knee's infected, man.
It just... it won't go away.  PROBST: It doesn't look good.  No, it doesn't feel good.
 PROBST: Taj now having a little trouble. Brendan slipping a little bit.  I hate this challenge.
 This hurts.
 PROBST: J.T. now having a little movement.
Sierra has not budged. Debra has not budged. Coach and Tyson haven't budged.  Ooh, aah!
 PROBST: Taj now struggling.
Brendan drops out of the challenge. Taj right behind Brendan. And Erinn, three people out in
succession. We are now down to five: Sierra, Debra, J.T., Coach, and Tyson.
All vying for that first individual immunity. The only way to make sure you are safe tonight is to have
that necklace around your neck.
 Sierra, you're doing awesome.
 PROBST: J.T. struggling to hang on.
J.T. drops out of the challenge. We are now down to four.  All from old Timbira.  PROBST: So, Coach, does that
mean Timbira's still going strong? There's no merge?  We are going strong.
We're going strong, baby.  Dude, you did awesome.
 PROBST: Coach inching his way down the pole. Coach is now out. Sierra struggling for the first
time in this challenge.  Ow! Oh, that hurt.  PROBST: Are you all right?
That was a hard landing, wow.  Good job, though.  PROBST: That post got every part of your body on the way
down.  You can do it, little Debbie!  PROBST: We are now down to two people left in this
challenge: Debra and Tyson. Sometimes it is the simplest challenges that prove the most
trying.
 Okay, this really is starting to suck.  PROBST: Debra now struggling a little bit.
Tyson hanging on by a couple of toes.  Tyson, you be careful you don't fall off.
 Don't boss me around, lady.  I just don't want you to break your pretty little face.  That's true.
It is my money maker.  I know. (laughing)  Don't make her laugh.
 PROBST: Debra really struggling. She is the last thing keeping Tyson from immunity.
 Debra!  Debra drops out of the challenge. Tyson wins first individual
immunity.  Nice job.
 PROBST: Tyson, come on over.  Good job, Tyson.  PROBST: Congratulations. Tyson's safe at tonight's
Tribal Council. The rest of you, one of you guys going home tonight. Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp. Joe, stay behind. I want to have medical take a look.
Everybody else head back to camp. Congrats.  Am I staying here?
 PROBST: I just want to have medical take a look at you. Can we get medical to come in and take a look at Joe?
 It's real scary right now because I'm having to trust people I just met. You know, what I gotta do is
just remain strong to what I hope is a firm alliance. You know, I really don't have any other options.
I have to trust Coach and Tyson right now. And if I'm still here tomorrow, I'm not worried about old
Timbira anymore.
 Yeah, that, that hurt.  That's sore.  Yeah, that's sore.  PROBST: You feel it more?
 Yeah.  PROBST: You're not sounding optimistic, Lucy.  This is really swollen, so, I
have to make an assumption that there's a bunch of pus under there, um...  PROBST: I got a question,
too, at this point. What's your take? Are you... you still want to stay in the game?
 I want to stay in the game.  PROBST: Okay.  Yeah, I mean, I want you all to tell me if you don't go home
right now, you're going to lose the leg.  Yeah.  PROBST: What's at risk for
him right now? What are you most concerned about, Lucy?  Unfortunately, because this
infection is so close to the bone, is that the infection could actually enter your bone, and that's a bad infection.
Um, the other risk is that the infection goes to your blood, and that's extremely dangerous. In that regard, that can risk
death. This won't heal itself tomorrow.
 Very beautiful.  Right on the lips.  I love you.  I love you, too, sweetie.
Here, want to try it on?  Yeah.  Yeah, so, I kick ass, like I always do, and, uh, if any
ladies want my phone number, I guess, uh... ask. (thunder rumbling)  Wowee.
Is it going to rain all afternoon?  We immediately knew something was up with Joe
because he hadn't come back from the immunity challenge.  I hope Joe's okay.  Oh, yeah.
 We're hoping we can take out Brendan tonight. But, honestly, I've known these people for two days.
They're obviously crafty people. That's why they're out here. So, I don't trust anyone, but you've got to go with your gut
sometimes in this game. You gotta make desperate moves sometimes in this game, and I think this is one of them
for me.  Are your forearms all jacked up?  I only held with my fingers
and my toes the whole time. Even coming down, I just like...  You were probably smart to
not have shoes on.  When I climbed down a little bit, like, it loosened me up.
 That's how I fell off, when I went to stretch.  I kept trying to do that.  Mine kept falling out.
I couldn't get it to stay in.
 Lying to everybody, especially Brendan and Sierra, actually brings me pleasure. In my alliance now, Stephen and
J.T. have replaced Brendan and Sierra. I never liked Sierra ever. I have no clue why she's out
here other than to just give hope to stupid people around the world.
 Hey, it's the way it is, man.  I know, I know.  It's the way it is.  That's the way it is.
 And Brendan, he's really the sneakiest bastard I have to worry about. We smile at each other; we hug.
I've kissed him on the neck softly. He's felt my warm, steamy breath on the nape of his neck, even on
the small of his back. But, you know, as the old adage goes, keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
That's right, right?
 Here's the thing: if I go with you, you know... There's two basic alliances, right.
I know I can get to the final four with Taj and Brendan. And I will go with you, with Coach, Tyson, and Debbie now if
you promise me you will turn on them when the time comes.  I will...  All right, we just want to
talk. I just want to ask you guys.  Yeah.  Um, we're doing the beans
right now.  Right.  And then we're going to add a little bit of rice to them.
 Okay.  And then we'll, so, we'll eat, we'll just split it up and then in a couple of hours, we'll
split it up again. Good?  That's cool.  Okay.
 We're trying to get everything straight.
 If it's five, five, we gotta stay...  I will get Erinn... I will get Erinn to go to do this.
But she's not in on it still.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got it.
 What a mess.  We done with our awkward conversations?  Yeah, man.
 Get over here.  Is Joe back yet?  No.  Is it bad to fish in the
middle of the day in the rain?  It may be good to fish in the rain. You all want to try to eat some
fish before we go?  Yeah, we got plenty of time.  We got plenty of...  You guys want to go?
 Not right now. I'll meet you. I'll come down there later.  I might come down in a bit,
too. I like it down there.  All right.  There's definitely a
scenario where I could be in trouble, within Timbira; my old Timbira tribe senses something. If it's going on with Stephen
and Taj and myself, they might say, "Let's get rid of Brendan now." You know, who knows?
But so much of it is going to be on the fly. I'll have the immunity idol in my pocket and I'm not afraid to
play it tonight.  I feel like Brendan and Sierra haven't tried to really communicate yet.
 I know.
 Tonight?  Yeah.  How?  I don't think that they're
unified. I bet we could sway them. I think we could sway like, Coach, you know, Coach and J.T.
are seriously (indistinct) right now, have you noticed that?  Mm-hmm.
 Well, if you can pull it together, I'll do it.  You will?  Mm-hmm.
 I know how tight you guys are.  I mean, we're cool, but like I said, we've been over here
for two days now, and I haven't had the chance to talk to him, and I don't trust him anymore. I don't feel secure.
If we were even, it would probably be different, but because he has all the numbers, it just doesn't feel good...
you know?  Taj, your teeth are abnormally white, too.  So white.
 I bleach mine, too.  I'm obsessed with my teeth.  I'm, yeah, I'm the same.  I knew it when we merged.
I said my last hope is to talk to J.T.  You can trust me. I know I can trust you, man.
 And I know that.  Y'all just keep reassuring, you know, me or Joe.  Well, it was perfect because
you guys went out and talked and we were all in that circle, and I'm not telling any lies.  Okay.
 And they were going to vote you, and you're the warrior, and we're together now, man.  I'm on top of that, man.
 All right, listen, just don't burn me, okay.  I won't, man.  I just screwed my whole
tribe.  If I'm reading Coach right, he's telling me the truth. My life in this game is in his
hands tonight. But, you know, this is a game for a million dollars. They're voting me tonight.
 What?  Coach just said Sierra and Brendan are the only two that's going to vote me.
 That means...  Hopefully, he won't play his idol.  He's not going to play his
idol.  If he does, dude, I'm out.  You're not going out.  I was thinking, if, uh, and
Brendan's going to vote me.  Damn, it's 'cause Joe's injured.  That's fine.
If Brendan's voting me and Sierra's voting me...  We can split votes.  That's two.
 We can split votes. This is awesome. If Brendan plays the idol, then it doesn't matter how many
of us vote for him. One of the Jalapao tribe, whoever he chooses, is going home.
And it sounds like Brendan is targeting J.T., which is disastrous for me. So, our solution is to split
the votes. We have at least four or five solid votes for Brendan. The rest of us vote for Sierra.
That way, if Brendan does play the idol, Sierra's going home, and Brendan can go home next.
 J.T. and I were talking about splitting the vote just in case he uses his idol. So, four people, five people
vote for him, and two or three vote for Sierra. That way he can't vote J.T. out no matter what.
 That's true. That's true. Let's do it.  Yeah.  We need to split the vote
now. We need four on Brendan, three on Sierra, and then Sierra and Brendan's can go anywhere and
they don't count for anything. So, whether an idol's played or not. You know?
 I gotcha.  One of them goes.  At Tribal tonight, if it goes the way that I planned it to, it
will absolute shake the hell out of the foundations that were Timbira.
 Not a thing biting.  Really?  No.  Not a thing?
 Nothing.  Not the time?  I have no patience for sitting around holding a rod in
my hand without anything working. Did you catch that, Debbie?  I got it.
I heard it.  So what do you want to call me? You want to call me
The Orchestrator for orchestrating a beautiful move at this point in the game that does two things?
Keeps my initial game plan intact and I don't have to compromise by keeping weak people around, and voting out
one of the strongest, most manipulative and possibly most deceitful players to date. Or do you want to call me
The Dragonslayer because I'm cutting the head off of the dragon? You guys call me whatever you
want to because at this point in time, I feel brilliant!
 Is that Jeff?  It is.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.
 Joe is gone.  No.  You know what, I'm going to give him applause for not having
an umbrella. All right.  PROBST: Ah, I missed you guys.
 You're not with Joe.  PROBST: No, Joe's not with me. Uh, have an update.
You guys left the challenge; we kept Joe behind. Medical really wanted to check out his leg.
Everybody knows he's been battling a pretty decent infection. They looked at it, did
a thorough assessment. He can't continue.  What?!  PROBST: They said the risk of
him staying longer was too serious.  Aw, jeez.  PROBST: That if they left him
longer in the game, that this could get worse. He didn't want to go. He asked if he could stay.
He asked if he could stay another day, but he couldn't stay out here any longer. So he's going to be evacuated
via helicopter. He'll be taken to the nearest city, get looked at at a hospital.
They may do surgery; they're not sure, but either way, he'll be taken care of. So the impact on you guys is
no Tribal Council.  Ooh! I mean, I don't mean to sound so happy.
(laughter)  PROBST: Good news, bad news. No Tribal Council for you guys. Nobody getting voted out.
Nobody else going home.  Can you tell Joe that we love him and miss him?  PROBST: Try to stay dry and
take care of yourselves. And the game continues. I'll see you soon.  Thanks for coming by.
 PROBST: All right, guys, good night.  Thanks, bye.
 Brendan lives to see another day. I am disappointed. The main thing about getting
the plan to work was keeping everybody quiet for long enough to vote him out so that he didn't use an idol if he had it.
Now, I don't know how much is going to leak or what's going to happen, but...
 I can't wait till the next Tribal Council even more so now because I have had some plans in order and, uh, I think
someone on the old Timbira tribe just bought themselves three days, and they don't even know it.
 So, no Tribal tonight. That sucks. You know, I mean, it's like, we've got a game plan.
I'm ready for action. The Dragonslayer has to wait another day to taste blood.
 The doctor said that if I... if it got bad, which it would have if I would've stayed, that I, you know, could potentially
lose my leg or lose my life. This game is cool, but it's not that cool. I-I don't want...
I don't want to die. I'd rather walk home. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT

 PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  PROBST: Next time on Survivor:  Brendan wages war
on Coach.  The Exile alliance hibernated for a while. It's finally going to rear its
ugly head.  PROBST: And Coach fights back.  We're cutting the head off
the dragon. When it comes head-to-head, we'll see who really was the chosen one.
 The fact that you get blindsided literally by your own body just goes to show you that this game is...
Anything can happen. And I think that, like, that's... The main lesson I learned is
that generally speaking, like, Mother Nature's pretty awesome force, and this game is tough. I don't know.
It sucks, man.
