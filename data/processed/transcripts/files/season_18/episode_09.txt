 PROBST: Previously on Survivor:  It's a merge!  Oh, my God!
 PROBST: The tribes merge.  To the merge, hear, hear!  PROBST: And they name themselves "Forza."
The old Jalapao came in with only four members to Timbira's six.  We're in control, baby.
 PROBST: And J.T. became the target.  Right now, J.T. needs to go.  PROBST: But some former
Timbira members made new friends.
And new plans.
 In my alliance now, Stephen and J.T. have replaced Brendan and Sierra.  PROBST: Feeling safe, Brendan
ignored his Exile alliance...
leaving Taj open to new ideas.
But everyone's plans were cut short when Joe was evacuated. Joe's been battling a pretty decent infection.
Medical did a thorough assessment. He can't continue.  What?!
 PROBST: So, no Tribal Council.  Brendan lives to see another day.
Now, I don't know what's going to happen.  PROBST: Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 That sucks. Joe left camp today, and it was just kind of this funk that was permeating the camp.
And we're sitting around there, looking at the fire. Nobody was saying anything.
And I just wanted to share a piece of my life with them. I wanted to show them that no matter how bad it gets in your
life, there's always something that's going to make it much worse.
 I want to hear this story.  So, I shared with the tribe one of the stories about the time that I got caught in the
Amazon and thought I was going to get killed.
Now, they were probably, you know, four, four and a half feet tall.
I paddled so hard that my hands started bleeding.
 You don't want to say, "Coach, hey, let's have a reality check here. But no one said a word.
It was silent when he finished and everybody was kind of going around looking at each other, like, "Whoa!"
 How much does it cost to get a military copter to drop you in?  That would be free.
 How?
 Honestly, like, you know, Coach is either the new coming of Jacques Cousteau, or he's, you know, basically the biggest
fraud that is in this game.  They were just, like, ecstatic that I wanted to come down there.
 I don't believe this guy anymore. And if I don't believe his stories, how I can believe what
he's saying to my face?

(bird calling)  What's he doing?  Warrior poses.  He likes to do that in the
morning.  He's kind of like a snake.  Oh, yeah, he's like a snake, ready to strike.
 Don't bother him and he won't bother you.  Brendan is targeting me for the next Tribal Council.
But I am involved in a power alliance right now, uh, the alliance is Coach, myself, Tyson, Stephen, and Debbie,
so Brendan is going home.  Hi, guys.  I was watching you.  I'm having a great day so
far.  What's it from? Like, where is that...?  Yeah, it's called chong ran.
And it's, uh, ancient Tibetan. If you do a Google search on it, you won't find it. It's only passed down verbally.
You have to go there to the monastery to study it.  Wow.
 Bow and arrow pose?
 I feel like I'm in control of this game. I have the power alliance, commanding my officers, running
the show, like I was born to do. You know, if you look at it, to defeat an army, you have to cut off the head of the dragon,
which is why I nicknamed Brendan "the dragon." Hence, my name, the "Dragonslayer."
Where does Sierra fit into all this? With the comments that she made today, Sierra is the bowel
movements that come out of the dragon. After Brendan, Sierra's got to go.
 Worried about Joe?  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's doing fine. I hate having him leave the
game.  I know. Well, you guys were such good friends, too.
 I know.  Like, I was so happy to have met him. It was so nice to know that
like, Joe was going to be here, and I was going to have, you know, somebody that I knew I could go to with stuff.
And then for that to not happen, I was so bummed. And I just like him, you know, like, he's a cool guy.
 He's a cool guy. He's a real cool guy. Stephen as well. Stephen's an awesome guy.
 Yeah, I really like him. Well, I like all you guys. I'm like, "How do I like your tribe more than I like my own?"
 Are you aligned with anyone here now?  Um, aligned, not so much. I've kind of stayed pretty
neutral, but, you know, regardless of who I'm talking to or whatever, the only alliance I had in this game was
Joe, so... When you break it down, you've got my original tribe, where we knew I was the first one out.
Then I have these new kids who are down in numbers and really need a fourth. But no matter how the dice
rolls, I've got some room to play around. It's really nice.  Things are in our favor
right now.  Yeah, because like I said, I like you guys more than I like my own tribe.
 Erinn's vote would be huge, you know, because I lost Joe. He was a huge, solid vote. But now, Taj, myself, Stephen,
and Erinn could easily turn the game around. So, it's good to know if I need her, I can call on her.
I know things are different from the time I got here.  Yeah.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Absolutely.
 Yeah.  PROBST: For today's challenge, you will be divided into teams of three.
Each team will have one row of eight color-coded ceramic tiles. On my go, one member from each team will toss a metal ball,
attempting to knock out one of the tiles of the other two teams. When you're out of tiles,
you're out of the challenge. Last team left standing wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
for?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  PROBST: The winning threesome
will be taken on an afternoon of whitewater river rafting down the Rio Novo.  Yes!
 PROBST: This is world-class river rafting, an experience you will not soon forget. After the rafting trip, you
will have a nice picnic, sandwiches, chicken wings, brownies.  Brownies!
 Oh, my God!  PROBST: In addition, the winning threesome will choose one member of either of the two
losing teams to go to Exile Island alone. A lot at stake. You guys ready to get to it?
 Yep.  PROBST: We'll draw for teams and we'll get started. All right, we have our teams:
Debbie, Brendan, J.T. Tyson, Taj, Coach. Stephen, Sierra, and Erinn. Here we go.
First shooters, head up. Your goal is to break the tile of one of the other teams, not your own.
 Stephen! Stephen, man, what are you doing?!  PROBST: Stephen and Coach
going for black. Debbie going for red. Here we go: three, two, one. Toss.
Debbie knocks out a red tile.  Yes!  PROBST: Stephen and Coach both knock out a black tile.
Black team loses two tiles in that round.  Come on. Let's go.  Easy, Coach.
 Next group. Sierra's going to go red; Tyson going after black.  Why is everybody after the
black team?  Your team is a little stacked, I think.  We're throwing underhand
breaking tiles. None of us have ever done this in our lives.  I have.
 Coach likes to have the attention. I mean, all the great stuff he's done.
Sounds almost too good to be true.  PROBST: Here we go. Three, two, one, toss.
Brendan breaks a white tile. Sierra takes out a red tile Tyson gets nothing. Black is down two tiles.
Red is down two tiles. White is down one tile. The more tiles you have, the better off you are.
Brendan breaks a white tile. J.T. with a long toss. Sierra's on fire! Connects, knocking out a
white tile. Tyson wipes out a white tile.  Yeah! My first one today!
 PROBST: With that round, red is now down to one tile left. Black team, white team, each have two tiles left.
We are getting down to it. Debbie going for white; Stephen and Coach going for black. Three, two, one, toss.
Debbie tosses and misses. Stephen misses. Coach annihilates a black tile.
Black team now down with one tile left. The red team has one tile left, and the white team has two
tiles left.  Finish the red off. And I'll miss, Erinn.  Okay.
 Oh, oh, you want to send her to red?! Oh, okay.  All right, well, I'll get
right (indistinct)  Taj, come over there with white. Go back to white with J.T.
 PROBST: Erinn is trying to take out the last tile for the red team.  Erinn, I'm going to whip
your tail.  PROBST: J.T. and Taj attempting to take out the last two tiles for the
white team. Three, two, one, toss.
Erinn knocks out the last remaining red tile. The red team is now out of this challenge.
Sierra could put the black team out of this and win it for the white team with one toss. Three, two, one, toss.
 Oh!  PROBST: Sierra short. Brendan takes out another white tile.
Black team, white team each have one tile left. This could do it. Erinn for the white team,
J.T. for the black team. Three, two, one. Toss. Erinn goes deep, just too far.
J.T. just too short.  Oh, I thought that was it, man. Deb, come on.
 PROBST: Debbie and Stephen, each looking to take out the last tile of the other team. Three, two, one, toss.
Debbie, no chance. Stephen, no chance. Sierra and Brendan. Brendan looking to win it for
the black team. Three, two, one. Toss. Oh!
 PROBST: Sierra short. Brendan clips it, but not enough. That white tile is clipped,
but it is still standing.  Oh, man!  PROBST: It still counts. J.T. going to try to put the
finishing touches on that white tile. Erinn would like to win it for the white team.
Three, two, one, toss.  PROBST: Erinn with a good toss.  Nope, it's not down.
 PROBST: Erinn knocks the black tile, but it doesn't fall. It cannot get any closer than this.
Both tiles have been broken. Neither one of them has fallen through. Stephen, you may not even have
to hit that tile. You might just hit the wood. The vibration may knock it in.  Stephen, don't do nothing
crazy now.  PROBST: Three, two, one, toss.  Oh, no!
 PROBST: Debbie too far, Stephen too short. Big reward on the line: whitewater river rafting, nice
picnic, brownies, chicken wings, sandwiches.  Oh, my God, this is a nailbiter.
 PROBST: Here we go. Three, two, one, toss. Sierra short. Brendan knocks out the final
white tile. Black team wins reward.
Black team, come on over. J.T., Debbie, Brendan, nice job. Before we send you on a nice reward, you have a big decision
to make. Figure out which person you are sending to Exile Island. They are going alone.
They will not be choosing anybody to go with them.  Stephen.  PROBST: Stephen, grab your
stuff.  Be the wizard, Stephen. Be the wizard.  PROBST: A map, even though
you've been there before. Head back out the way you came.  Sorry, Stephen.  Thanks, Jeff.
No, it's my pleasure.  PROBST: Stephen will return in time for the next immunity challenge.
All right, J.T., Brendan, Debbie, nice reward. Whitewater river rafting, nice afternoon picnic.
It will be a nice little break. You will head back to camp and go on your reward tomorrow. Got it.
 PROBST: All right, guys, sadly, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff and head back to camp.
 Thanks, Jeff.  PROBST: Coach, you can, uh, leave that behind.  I'm sorry.
I'm so pissed off right now.  I'm sorry.  I wanted to get on that river in some type of raft or kayak
since I got here.  I mean, I expect Brendan trying to scheme. I'm not really that worried,
Brendan being gone with J.T. and Debbie. Those are two of the strongest allies.
So, it actually worked out well. I just hope the extra food Brendan gets isn't going to hurt our chances for winning
immunity.  Clue six: "A big wooden head is what you have here. Look in the gap that you'll
find in the rear." No surprise here. Great. This is my first Exile out here
alone. It's the first of anybody's Exiles out here alone, and I got the new clue to the same idols
that we know about. So, I know there's no new idol in the game.
I'm definitely concerned about being on Exile. I haven't made fire yet at camp. I tried a few times and I
failed, and I was so embarrassed I hadn't tried again. So, I knew that by forcing
myself to come out here, either I would make fire, make food, or I would die.
It looked like I might die. I was trying for about an hour or two to make fire, just smacking that flint over and
over again with a machete. And nothing.
How about that! Damn, I can build a fire! How about that! Finally, as darkness was
starting to close around me, I got a spark; it caught; and the whole thing took. It was like giving birth to my
first child. I felt so proud of that little fire that I just wanted to stay out here and tend to it for the
rest of my life. So, even though I missed out on that good lunch and a fun, relaxing, water rafting trip,
being out here and making it is like winning my own reward.
 Brendan, myself, and Debbie went to the reward, and we had a blast. I've actually never been able
to go whitewater rafting and that's something I've always wanted to do forever. I felt just like a little kid.
 A-ha!  Yeah!  Great job!  The reward was so much fun.
The pure joy that was on J.T.'s face to see how much he just soaks it up and appreciates it. What a great soul.
So sincere, so real. Like, all qualities that you want in people that surround you or at least I do.
 Forza!
 After we did, like, the best rafting ever, we came along this huge sandbar and I knew it was our picnic.
 This is amazing! I've died and gone to heaven. Chips! There's chips!
Oh, my God! Look at those brownies! Whoo! Oh, my God.
This is the best food in the world.  Oh, my God! I had a really good day.
I mean, it was a lot better than I had pictured. I figured Brendan and I being together would kind of be a
dull trip, but there wasn't a dull moment at all.
 No?  About what?  Just about how to, you know.  Keep me in the game a little
longer.  Have some fun.  If there's an opportunity, I damn sure will do what I can
do, whatever I can.  All right, yeah. I always kind of define winning in a lot of my life of saying
like, I'm going to be #1. If I take J.T. in the finals with me, he's going to beat me. I know it's crazy, but for me,
winning in this game is about getting to an outcome at the end of the game which is going to satisfy me.
If he wins it, that's like me winning this game. How do I get him to the finals? I don't know.
That's the next step I need to wrap my head around. Let's have some fun.  I'm definitely up for it,
man.
 I stayed up all night. I sat in that shelter and did not sleep at all, just running through all the different
scenarios about how do I get J.T. to the finals. And at a certain point, all the pieces, like, just fell and you
could see the puzzle and how it needs to be put together.
 Here's how we're gonna do it. Um, I don't think we should send J.T. home.
We had the awesome time. He's such a good dude. Debbie had such a good time with him.
 He is. He's one of the most amazing people I have ever met in my life.
 I think what we should do is you, me, Taj, Stephen, J.T., take out Tyson, Coach, and Erinn.
Start taking them out.  This morning, Brendan is like, "All right, here's what's going on.
I really like J.T. I think J.T. deserves to be here," and I feel the same way. Like, I really respect J.T.
So, we're going to try to get Coach and Tyson.
 Okay, so, I know how to do it.
 Change it? How?  You, me, Stephen, J.T., and Sierra...
 Okay.
Okay, okay.  And, Taj?  Yes?  We haven't talked...
 I know, we haven't had a chance to.  That's got to make you uncomfortable, but you, like,
you gotta trust me.  I can't describe Timbira. I really want to know what that word stands for because it
could mean "confused." Coach and Tyson want to blindside Brendan, and, um, Brendan is trying it vote out
Tyson or Coach. We haven't even had to really put any plans into action yet because they're so busy trying
to get out their own tribe members right now. We're like, "Okay, do what you gotta do and we'll come in
later."  Sierra knows the plan. Yesterday, on the river trip, I talked to J.T. and I was like
"J.T., I think I can save you." He's such a good dude.  I know, he is. I love him to death, and I
don't want him to go.  No, I agree. I agree.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Stephen, returning from Exile Island.
 Welcome back, buddy.  PROBST: You were out there for a while on Exile this time.  It was a couple of days
alone, yeah, but actually, not that bad. The weather was pretty good. I had big fires both nights.
I didn't get much sleep, but it was, you know, it was all right.  PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
 Let's do it.  PROBST: First things first. Tyson, hand back the necklace.  It's too gaudy for me anyway.
 PROBST: Does that mean you don't want it again?  Oh, I'll probably wear it again.
 PROBST: All right. For today's challenge, you will each be attached to a long rope that is threaded through a
series of obstacles. You'll climb over, crawl under, maneuver around these obstacles as you race to the finish.
First three to finish move on to the final round, where, once again, you will be attached to one long rope, only this time,
the obstacle is three levels high. It will seriously complicate things.
First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at winning this game.
Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be going home. We'll draw for spots and get started.
Here we go. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! There is a learning curve to
this challenge. Things that will help make getting around this rope a little easier, but there are no
shortcuts.
J.T. off to a quick start. Tyson off to a quick start. Debbie, J.T., Tyson, all doing very well.
Coach flying through the course. Brendan right in there. Sierra hanging in there. Taj struggling, in dead last.
Stephen not doing a lot better. Erinn right in there. It's Tyson and J.T. battling it out right now.
Sierra's now through. It's Tyson, J.T., and Sierra. Brendan's through. Coach frustrated, stuck.
Nothing prepared him for the rope-a-dope. Tyson and J.T., neck and neck. Erinn now moving on to the next
obstacle. Tyson has finished the second obstacle. Tyson now on the last obstacle,
J.T. right behind him. Tyson and J.T. in very good shape. Three people are moving on to
the final. The other six will have no shot at immunity. J.T. throwing himself over this
challenge. Brendan now on to the last obstacle. It is Tyson, J.T., and Brendan.
Sierra now is in it. Four people fighting for three spots. Taj and Stephen still back on
the first obstacle. J.T. very close. Tyson very close. It's going to come down to
Brendan and Sierra for that final spot. Brendan with a bit of a lead over Sierra.
J.T. is across first. J.T. moving on to the final. Tyson is across. Tyson moving on to the final.
Brendan and Sierra battling for one final spot.
Brendan losing his shoes.
Brendan moves on to the final! Tyson, J.T., and Brendan, moving on to the final. Here we go, for immunity.
Tyson, J.T., Brendan. Survivors ready? Go! First round was very close.
Only one will win immunity. A lot of bodies being launched. Tyson off to an early lead. J.T. is right behind him.
Cannot fall behind in this challenge.
Tyson and J.T. very close. Brendan right in there. Brendan now in the lead.  Keep going, J.T.!
 PROBST: Brendan still with a lead over J.T. and Tyson.
Tyson making up some ground now. Getting down to it. It is Brendan and Tyson. J.T. has fallen out of it.
On the last part of this course, Tyson now with the lead.  Tyson!  PROBST: Tyson flying through
this. Tyson wins immunity!
 Oh, my God!  Tyson saved the day ensuring that Brendan would go home tonight.
In case he plays the immunity idol, we're gonna split the votes, four for Brendan, three for Sierra.
Brendan is the dragon. I'm the dragonslayer. This is gonna be the biggest power move to date of this game,
no question about it.  PROBST: Tyson, come on over.  Tyson!  PROBST: As he predicted, for
the second time, Tyson has immunity once again. Tyson's safe at Tribal Council. Not the same for the rest of
you. One of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
I will see you at Tribal.  Tyson won the immunity. We can't vote Tyson. So, I decided on Coach.
It will be nice to have him out of here, I think.  Congratulations.  Thanks, dude.
You were awesome.  Seriously, it was a delight watching you. It was like something out of...
 Dude, you need a hug, man.  You need a hug.  You got your fire started.  I got my fire started.
 Oh, you were so worried.  Unfortunately I spent like an hour just chopping at that flint and I made it and it was like,
it was actually one of the best moments of my life.  Oh!  For me, it was a big step.
 I'm very proud of you.  We missed your poetry yesterday. I feel like I have no skills at
all.  You know what I did?
 I started this plan to eliminate Brendan days ago, but due to default, we didn't even go to Tribal.
I've already got it set up so four votes go to Brendan, three votes go to Sierra. If Brendan gets wind of it and
uses his idol, Sierra is gone. Brendan's gone in three days from that. I'd like to see him go first
because I'd like three days of just bossing her around and telling her to shut up. Probably won't win me her vote
from the jury, but it would probably win me everybody else's vote, so... so it would be a win-win for me.
 What is it?  Water.  All right, can we just sit down real quick?
 Yeah.  The Exile alliance hibernated for a while. Uh, it's finally going to rear
its ugly head.  I talked to Taj this morning. I think we go after Coach. We get us four and Taj, I had
an extensive conversation with Taj this morning about it.  Okay.  You guys cool?
 Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Myself, Sierra, Taj, Stephen,
and now J.T. are all voting Coach. I think that this will be one of the biggest blindsides
so far in the game. Um, so, I guess I'm happy to be a part of on the good side.
 I thought you might. Wow, that changes everything.  He said he wants me in the finals.
 Why would he want that?  He likes me a lot.  But that's crazy.  I know.
 It would be a really strong play. We might have to seriously think about it.
 You know what, he's crazy. He is somewhat crazy. I think that story about him being captured on the Amazon,
that's just hard to believe.  That is pretty hard to believe.  I mean, (indistinct) I mean,
I wouldn't reckon with them son of a bitches, don't you think? I would have come back with a damn .30-.30 Winchester.
Something, you know what I mean?
 I would definitely say we're in control of this game now.  It's a big difference, you know?
Jalapao came into the merge down in numbers, but before the first Tribal Council we come to, I'm the deciding factor.
It's huge. I can go with Brendan right now and get rid of Coach or I can go with Coach and Tyson and get
rid of Brendan. It's completely in my court.
 Clean pots and water.  Clean pots and water?  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to
Tribal. The old Timbira is going to go after J.T., but I'm going to take out Coach.
 Sierra's got that pot...  She does?  I don't like misleading people, but I feel like this is
the one time in life that you're actually allowed to do it and you get a get-out-of-jail-free pass.
 I'm down with that.  Okay.  Tyson.
 J.T.?  Yeah.
 Just pass it around.  Okay.  Pass it around, make sure everybody knows.
Everybody already pretty much knows.  Sierra, you good?  Yeah.
Done.  Done and done? Okay. Yeah, okay, cool.
 Brendan suspects nothing. In fact, Brendan still thinks we're going to vote J.T. off. But in reality, we're cutting
the head off the dragon and sending Brendan home, and I feel very happy about that. You know, leaders are born.
I'm not saying Brendan is not a naturally born leader, but when it comes head-to-head, we'll see tonight who really was the
Chosen One. It's going to be Coach way. So, that's very fulfilling.
 PROBST: So, you guys have spent a little bit of time together as one tribe. Erinn, I'm guessing certain
roles are emerging. Who's the person that keeps the tribe laughing?  Tyson.
He just always has some sort of offhanded, witty comment to make. He's kind of the class clown.
 PROBST: J.T., who tells the best campfire stories?  Uh, Coach probably tells the best campfire stories, no doubt.
 PROBST: Taj, what's the best story Coach has told?  Well, I love the Amazon story because he told us about how he
was captured by this tribe and he was beaten and he escapes and he's, like, paddling for two days down the Amazon River to
get away. It's so unbelievable. It was incredible.  PROBST: Coach, this really
happened or this is a movie version of what you want to have happened?  I tried to actually tone it
down because if I tell them, you know, that the tribe was, you know, looking at my ass, talking about eating my ass,
so, actually, you know, when I tell these stories, I usually try to give like the "PG-13" version of it.
 PROBST: Coach, does it bother you that some people might question these stories?  What I've been through in my
life, it's pretty fantastic. I got, you know, scars all over my body that I can point to, of the, you know, five, six,
seven, eight, life or death situations I've been through. PROBST: Five, six, seven, or
eight life-or-death situations?  Probably more than that, I mean, if you want me to recount them I will.
I've been through a hurricane. I've been attacked by a shark, had a run-in with a crocodile, got captured by the
Indian tribe; I mean, there were some very defining moments in my life where I thought these were the last three or four
seconds. So, it doesn't bother me that people wanna question that. They cannot question my
integrity and my honesty. That's how I'm playing this game. That's how I play my life.
 PROBST: From the beginning, Coach, you've talked about the numbers, sticking together, having a strong group.
Still feel confident about that?  I do feel confident about tonight's vote.  PROBST: Tyson, how big is
trust in tonight's vote?  If one of the Jalapao members goes home, then I think that Timbiras stayed
loyal, and if for some reason a Timbira tribe member does go home, I think everybody will seriously rethink, uh, their
strategies.  PROBST: Stephen, how does that sit with you? What can you do, if anything,
to change your fate?  You know, in my case, I'm just hoping I have enough time to get to know more people.
I'm really glad that J.T. is over there with a much larger target on his back than I have on mine.
 PROBST: Taj, do you think that's true? The people that are the most physically threatening at
challenges are now gonna be the biggest targets?  Yeah, I definitely think so. I mean, J.T. is fast.
He's a lovable person. He's like a triple threat because you just can't find anything wrong with him.
 PROBST: Coach, you agree with that? If you're a physical threat in this game, it's time for you to
go?  The seven layers of heaven with the Vikings were determined on how they were
defeated in battle. I want to surround myself with warriors.  PROBST: So, Brendan...
 Even if that means that they defeat me, I think that that's the honorable way to play this game.
 PROBST: Brendan, biggest physical threats going to be the first to go?  It's natural to kind of want
to go after the strong, but just because you're strong doesn't mean you go deep in this game.  PROBST: Tyson, has there been
much talk about the idol and that it's hidden, meaning somebody might have it and nobody knows?
 I just assumed that everybody that's been to Exile could possibly have the idol. And if I figure out who has it
then great; if not, everybody who's been there has it.  PROBST: Taj, how does that make you feel?
You've been to Exile.  I don't have it.  PROBST: Erinn, do you have it?
 I don't have it.  PROBST: Stephen, do you have it?  No.
 Brendan, do you have it?  I have it.  PROBST: Brendan has it. All right, at least we've
cleared that up. You guys ready to get to the vote? Tyson has the individual
immunity idol. I take it you're keeping it for yourself? All right, cannot vote for
Tyson. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. J.T., you're up.
 The ancient samurai used to say that if you wanted to win the war, you had to cut off the head of the dragon.
You, my friend, are the dragon, and I am the dragonslayer.
 This is my wizard lightning shooting you back home. Ga-bow!
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
First vote: Coach.
Coach. Two votes Coach. Brendan. Two votes Coach;
one vote Brendan. Brendan. Two votes coach; two votes Brendan.
Brendan. That's three votes Brendan; two votes Coach. Sierra.
That's three votes Brendan; two votes Coach; one vote Sierra. Sierra.
Three votes Brendan; two votes Coach; two votes Sierra. We're tied.
Three votes Sierra; three votes Brendan; two votes Coach. One vote left.
Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins,  and the first member of our jury: Brendan.
You need to bring me your torch.
Brendan, the tribe has spoken.  Good luck, fellas.
 PROBST: Well, judging by the amount of smiles, I'd say that was a pretty good blindside. So much for old tribal
loyalties. This is clearly an individual game. Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT

 PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on  Survivor:  You're going to be the next to go.
 PROBST: Sierra fights for her life.  I'm trying to explain my side so it doesn't look like I
was the mastermind.  I don't think you were the mastermind. I don't think you're smart
enough for it.  PROBST: Can she save herself?  You made your bed. It kills me to have this kid
here asking me to throw her a bone. It breaks my heart.
 I knew at the merge that what would happen is I'd become a big target. I didn't think it'd happen
quite that quickly, um, but it kind of feels good to blindside because I wanted to blindside someone, too.
That's all part of the game. The thing that Sierra probably needs most is in my pocket right now: the hidden immunity idol.
But it doesn't matter. She'd be next, regardless, to go. It's just a matter of time.
