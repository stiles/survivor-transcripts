 PROBST: Previously on Survivor: Two tribes-- Jalapao in red and Timbira in black-- were stranded
in Brazil's Tocantins. Take a look around-- Brazilian highlands. Beautiful part of Brazil,
but extremely harsh. (thunder rumbles) One person from each tribe is not going to make this journey.
Based only on first impressions, the tribes believed they were voting out one of their own.  Zebra-striped top.
 Sierra, head over.  Older lady.  PROBST: Sandy, you can't be happy about this.
 I'm pissed.  PROBST: But the game wasn't over for Sandy and Sierra. They had only been voted off the
trek. They were flown to their tribe camps in a helicopter, leaving their unhappy tribe mates to
walk for hours.  This thing is getting heavy. I mean, really heavy.  PROBST: Alone in their
camps, Sandy and Sierra discovered a clue to a hidden immunity idol.  People may think this is a
really stupid idea, but...  PROBST: Instead of searching for the idol, Sierra decided to win over the Timbira tribe with
hard work, which might have succeeded.  Well, you know, Sierra, we all love her.
 PROBST: Or not.  But even though she's awesome, she's got to go.  PROBST: Sandy searched for
the idol at Jalapao and came up short.  Wonder what a pace is.  PROBST: Putting her in
danger. Carolina struggling to stay up. (cheering) But when Jalapao suffered their
first loss... Jalapao, Tribal Council tonight. The first person will be voted out of this game, and it's
coming from your tribe. ...Sandy was in deep trouble. But Carolina's bossiness...  Let's try to get everything
done as soon as possible. When it comes to, like, working, I can get very opinionated.
 PROBST: ...made for a surprise decision. Carolina, the tribe has spoken. Sandy narrowly escaped.
Can she survive another week? 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
 Look around the outside of... (chattering quietly)
 It's not like we just picked randomly.  No, I know.  I made it through Tribal
Council by a landslide. I think Carolina played her, uh, cards terribly wrong, and so she's kept me in this game so
far. (Sandy laughs) Lord, thank you! That's our boy.
He said, "We're going to have fire," didn't you, honey? I believe I'm underestimated in this game.
I want to win this thing. And as long as I'm here, I can win it. Thank you all so much for
letting me hang in here with you all for a few more days.  We just did what's best for the team, you know.
 Oh, thank you so much.  Now that Carolina is out, I mean, we all pretty much agreed that she just swapped places
with Sandy. Sandy was going to be first and then Carolina after that. Now Carolina was first and now
Sandy after that. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION

 Feel how soft.  Let me have a bite of that, Joe.  Try that.
 Oh, my God.  Maybe a little longer, I think.
 We need some protein. We need protein in a bad way right now.
 Yeah.  Yes.  I don't know if the whole tribe's up for it, but we're
going to eat some termites today. All right, so there was a couple of mounds over here.
There's a mound right there.  Should we just open them up and pick them up?  Most definitely.
 All right, ready?  Yeah.
 Ew, what's all them, termites?  Oh, yeah, those are termites.  Oh, that's wild.
 I've never been in a situation where I've been deprived of food for a long period of time.
I'm a teenager, and I'm used to having those, those comfort foods at home, where if I'm hungry, I can eat whenever I
want. And out here, if I want a snack, I'm going to have to go find something.
Nuh-uh, buddy, you're coming to Papa. (Joe grunts)  Ah, ay-yo!
Holy cow! Look at that big one!  I got to have that for fishing.
 Oh, get... no, no. Eat that.  Just throw it in there.  Okay, all right.
 Sweet mother of... Hey, Steve!  Should we cut it first or just bite into it?
 Eat it.  Bite the head off.  Bite the head off.  You want the head or the
tail?  He wants to bite the head off.  Just me and you splitting it?
 Get you some, man.  Ooh.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.
 It's tough. (groaning)  Whoo!  Oh, that's nasty.
 Your teeth are covered.  Oh, God. It's tough, man. You got to chew.
Bite it. Bite it.  Bite that sucker. I love it!  Maybe I'll just wait.
 I didn't try the worm. After I saw Stephen's face... (groans) Uh-uh.
I mean, I'll eat one at a challenge if I need to, but not in real life.  So good, so good.
 Gonna go, like, one of those.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Don't. All right, breakfast is after noon. (chuckles)
 Day one, my tribe tried to vote me out. I think they all perceive me as the weakest link.
And instead, I came here and there was a clue for a hidden immunity idol, but I haven't had a chance to look for it.
I'm still on the outs in my tribe, so I most definitely need to find it. And I need someone to help me
with that.
In this game, you need people on your side. And Brendan's the one person that didn't vote for me.
So he was the one I trusted the most.
 I'm glad you did. Thank you.
Oh, really? All right, but totally got your back. Sierra needed some help to
figure this out. I think she didn't necessarily feel comfortable that the tribe was not going to vote her off
in the first Tribal Council, and I think it's important taking a look for. It can't hurt.
 The first clue, it said, "The stick marks the spot on your biggest beach. Dig for a while and assistance
you'll reach." Oh, I got it! Oh, my God. Okay.
"With your back to the river, walk towards the lone tree. Dig after ten paces at the place where you'll be."
 Yeah.  Yeah.
 We'll probably figure it out when we get there.  Should I go check on Brendan and Sierra and make sure
they're still alive?  Go. I'll wait here.
 I just wanted to make sure you all were alive.
Cool! I love it! Oh, how cool is this? You guys have worked your tails
off.  Debbie caught us. Luckily, Sierra had the idea of saying that we're building a
fire pit, which I thought that was really smart. Uh, and just kind of went with it.
 This is so cool. This will be fun.  It'll be good, right?  Yeah!
We can pretend we're at the beach somewhere.  Debbie's so fun-loving. She was all about it.
I mean, she was our best salesperson.  Wait till you see what Brendan and Sierra built.
A massive fire pit for a big beach fire tonight.  Really?  I just don't think it makes
that much sense. I probably won't go, you know. I'd rather sit around here and talk crap.
 All right.  We were so close to getting caught. It may be a stupid move, but to
tell you the truth, I don't think it worth it to continue looking for the hidden immunity idol, even though I
know where I stand in this camp with these people, and I'm really worried about my position.
 Are you hungry?
 I was thinking I really want to steam, like, big, like, sea bass with, like, some olive oil and fresh lime juice and wrap it
up in aluminum foil and just let it steam.
Are you serious? (laughs)
 Are we going to do rice at the same time?
 That's fine with me.  The problem with that though is with the beans, you got to have them in water.
What happens with the rice is that the rice soaks it all up, and I'm afraid you're gonna burn stuff.
 You can just add water as you go.  Think it's gonna be undercooked or it's gonna be
overcooked.  Do you want to cook? I'm gonna tell you right now. It's either gonna be under-
or overcooked.  You know what, we've been waiting three days to eat. If I wait 20 more minutes for
rice to get cooked, it doesn't matter to me. But you're the one doing the cooking, so...
 I'm just telling you it's not gonna be perfect.  You want to put everything in the same pot.
So you guys want to do that, no problem. Candace, she has a personality like mine.
She looks to find faults in other people. I do it because I'm-I'm a coach, and I do it because that's my
job. And I think that maybe she just does it 'cause that's her nature.
 You're taking out, um, I think, some frustration...  No,  you're  taking out frustration.
You asked my opinion about the rice and beans. That's what I think.  I am an educated woman, and I
don't take crap from people. And Coach comes over feeling like he's the expert. In real life, like, I would have
broke it down, like, to his psyche, you know, and his insecurities and how he overcompensates.
I would've... I would've really, like, got to him. But here, I walked away, took a breath, worked on something
else because I knew he was gonna feel insecure and want to apologize because he was wrong.  I don't want to fight with
you.  I don't want to fight with you.  I just want to kiss you...
 Stop. See? You're so full of it.  No, listen...  Seriously, I don't even know
if you're being serious.  I am being serious.  You agreed that you took it out on me.
 And I apologize, and you apologize for coming at me a little bit strong.  (laughs): I did not even come
at you strong. I was just keeping it real.  A little... a little...  You can kiss right here.
Okay, that's good. That man's got a ego bigger than Brazil. That will be the death of him,
is his ego.
 Everywhere is smutty.  We can't stay clean over here. Y'all, seriously, I don't look
this rough normally. When I clean up I'm so cute. I promise you. My husband will tell you...
 What's your husband do?
 Oh, really?  He-he gets all the information and stuff.  Is he college or...?
 College and NFL.  Nice. Eddie...? Last name? What's your last name?  George.
 Eddie George?  You're married to Eddie George?  Mm-hmm.
 The Ohio State Buckeye Heisman Trophy winner?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  That's your husband?
 Mm-hmm.  Are you serious?  I'm so serious.  I...
 (laughs)  Oh, my God.  Eddie George is a former NFL running back.
He retired a few years ago from the NFL. And he also won the Heisman Trophy back in college.
Uh, it's a pretty neat deal to be on a tribe in  Survivor  with, uh, Eddie George's wife. Eddie George is not your
husband.  He's my husband. (laughs)  I absolutely have no idea who
Eddie George is. So while everybody around me is freaking out, I'm feeling like an absolute idiot.
 You just changed your  whole perspective to everybody.  I've got a completely different outlook on Taj.
Her husband's a very famous football player. So, you know, she's probably got a lot more money than I do.
 I hate to judge anybody by how much money they have, but I know I definitely need the million dollars more than Taj
does.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys! Timbira getting your first look at the new Jalapao Tribe. Carolina voted out at the first
Tribal Council. You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  Yeah.
 Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  PROBST: As the rain comes down to welcome us.
First things first. Jerry, I will take back immunity. Thank you.
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will race
through the water to grab a ball. You'll then work together until you can shoot the ball into your
basket, while members of the other tribe attempt to stop you any way they can. The matchups will be determined
randomly, with an equal number of men and women in each round. First tribe to score three baskets wins immunity and
something else.  Come on, baby, come on.  PROBST: I know you're hungry. This should help: fishing gear.
Everything you need: spear, two poles; you got line, tackle box, a mask, knife. This should change things back
at camp significantly.  Oh, yeah.  Big-time.  PROBST: In addition, the
winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to Exile Island. Good news: waiting for you on
Exile, the clue to the location of a hidden immunity idol. And there is a twist to Exile, which I will read after the
challenge. A lot at stake. Worth playing for?  OTHERS: Yeah!
 PROBST: Timbira, you have one extra member. Who are you gonna sit out?  I'll sit out.
 Debra, you'll take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize.
We'll get started.  Come on. (thunder crashing)  PROBST: All right, first
round, Taj, Stephen, and Sydney for Jalapao taking on Sierra, Candace, and Tyson for Timbira. Here we go.
Go!  (yelling)  PROBST: Stephen quickly out for Jalapao.
Taj trying to block out Tyson. Tyson takes down Stephen and passes off to Taj. A wild shot!
(indistinct shouting) Tyson has it for Timbira, over to Sierra. Sierra and Taj are fighting for
it now. Stephen getting in on it. Taj comes up with it for Jalapao.
Candace intercepts for Timbira. Timbira scores!  Whoo! All right!  PROBST: Timbira leads
one-zip.  (shouts indistinctly)  PROBST: All right, next round, it is J.T., Joe, and
Sandy for Jalapao taking on Erinn, Brendon, and Tyson for Timbira. Timbira leads one-zip.
Go! Brendon and Joe going at it. (indistinct shouting) Joe dives for it.
Brendon comes up with it. Brendon over to Tyson for Timbira. Tyson fakes J.T.
J.T. takes Tyson down. Big takedown. J.T. not letting Tyson get rid of that ball.
Another  takedown by J.T. Tyson gets rid of it to Brendon. Joe now trying to take Brendon down.
Erinn and Sandy are tied up at the other end. Brendon gets away from Joe. Brendon with a long shot, just
short. Tyson with a shot for Timbira. Timbira scores and now leads two-zip.
 All right, guys!  PROBST: Next round, all women. Candace, Sierra, and Erinn for
Timbira taking on Taj, Sydney, and Sandy for Jalapao. Timbira leads two-zip. We are playing to three.
Timbira could win it right here. Go! Sierra and Sydney fight for the ball.
Sierra has it. Sydney takes her down. Candace takes both of them down. Four women all fighting for that
ball. Taj now getting in on it. Sierra holding on to it.  Hold on to it, Sierra!
Hold on to it, Sierra! (indistinct shouting)  PROBST: Taj takes it from Sierra.
It's Taj and Candace now. Taj throwing Candace off of her! Taj has a free run. Can she make it count?
No!  Get it, Candace!  PROBST: Candace now has it for Timbira.
Candace with a long shot. Bounces back to Taj. She's short. Sydney puts it in!
Sydney keeping Jalapao alive. Timbira now leads two-one. Timbira still one basket away for the win.
Next round, three men from each tribe. J.T., Joe, and Spencer for Jalapao taking on Brendon,
Coach, and Jerry for Timbira. Timbira leads two-one. Here we go. Go!
 Go! Come on, Timbira!  PROBST: Joe and Brendon racing for it. Joe tries to skip it along.
It won't work. Brendon has it for Timbira. He's carrying Joe. Brendon with a wild pass to
Jerry. J.T. gets it for Jalapao. Coach is really dragging. J.T. fakes out Jerry...
and scores for Jalapao! We are tied two-two.  Yeah!  PROBST: Next round, Stephen,
Sydney, and Taj taking on Sierra, Candace, and Tyson. We are tied two-two. We're playing to three.
Winner of this point wins reward and immunity.  Let's go, Taj!  PROBST: Survivors ready?
Go!  Come on, Tyson! Go, Tyson!  PROBST: Stephen and Tyson
going at it. Sydney has it for Jalapao. Sierra takes her down. Tosses to Taj.
Taj and Candace going at it. Sydney takes it from Taj. Sierra holding her down. (indistinct shouting)
Sydney passes to Taj. Candace trying to take Taj down.  Get it, Tyson!  PROBST: Tyson has it for
Timbira.  Go, Tyson!  PROBST: A wild shot! Does no good.
 Let's go, Sydney!  PROBST: Sierra has it. This could win it. No!
Stephen pulls Tyson down. Sydney has it for Jalapao. Just misses. (thunder crashing)
(indistinct shouting)
Stephen has it for Jalapao, but he can't get a shot off.  Get loose! Get loose!  PROBST: Stephen breaks free.
Could win it for Jalapao. And he scores! Jalapao wins immunity and reward!
♪ ♪
Jalapao, congratulations.  Thank you.  PROBST: Big decision you have to make, Jalapao.
You're now gonna send one member of Timbira to Exile Island.
 PROBST: Brendan, grab your stuff; head over. Now to the twist I told you about earlier.
I have a very wet, but still effective note. It says to Brendan: "Choose one member of the winning tribe to
join you at Exile Island."
 PROBST: It's Taj and Brendan, opposite tribes, together on Exile. Could be interesting.
Here is a map to Exile. You will return to the game in time for the next Tribal Council.
I know you guys want this, Jalapao.  Yeah, thank you!  PROBST: Congratulations.
 It's beautiful!  PROBST: Jalapao, grab your reward. Head back to camp.
Happy fishing. Timbira, got nothing for you except a date with me at Tribal Council.
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. You have tonight and tomorrow to figure out who is going home.
 Our tribe's going to Tribal Council, so we're going to have to take somebody out. Sierra's probably the one to go.
She didn't make the trek with us at the beginning. I mean, she's trying, but it looks like she's numero uno on
the chopping block.  One, two, three!  Jalapao!  Today we won immunity and
fishing gear, which included a casting net, a couple fishing poles, a spear and some hooks and stuff like that, so
we're looking forward to spending our day without Tribal Council going to try to find some fish.
We need a physical challenge like that.  To be the winning tribe feels phenomenal.
If we lost immunity, there was probably a 50% chance of me going home. But we won, and I'm here for
another several more days.  A net-- a cast net.  Just ease out here about waist deep.
We have to figure out how to throw it so it spreads out when it hits and you can catch bait fish that way.
 J.T. has definitely emerged as our tribe leader and honestly, I'm thrilled to be out here with him.
He's like no one I would have met back at home and I think we're getting to know each other, which I thought is sort
of surprising because he's the Alabama country boy. He is Tom Sawyer, and I am the angsty city boy.
He might just be seducing me with his pretty country ways, but I'm smitten.
 You take the loose end...  Yeah.  You go back through that hole and back through that hole
you just created.  I see.  What you'll do is just hold it until you feel them, and
then just snatch it. Stephen and I come from different walks of life. He's definitely a city boy and
I'm an south Alabama cattle farmer. But we get along really well. So we have a good friendship.
 I'm going to become the greatest spear fisherman that ever existed.
Oh, my God! They're right here. There was, like, four or five of them.
We had some luck in seeing fish. Not so much in catching the fish, but I think the fishing trip was successful in
cementing my and J.T.'s friendship. And I know that it makes me look like his goofy, awkward,
right-hand man. But if he thinks I'm the goofy, awkward right-hand man, he's going to want to keep me around
longer.
There's something inside here.  When Jalapao tribe picked me to go to Exile, I was totally psyched.
I wanted the chance to get the immunity idol. Rice, awesome. And also to come to Exile with
somebody from the other tribe is a great opportunity to learn some information.
 "You must each choose an urn."  You go first.  All right.
Once Brendan and I made it to Exile Island, we found two urns, and there was a message that we both had to choose one.
There's nothing in mine.  Uh-oh. "Open in private."  Oh, crap!
 Can you give me a moment?  Take a second. We only have two cups.
 "Congratulations. You now have the clue to hidden immunity idol. It's up to you whether you
share this information with anyone else."
I opened up my cup and it had two notes in it. The first note was the first clue to find the immunity idol.
"If you want to be safe, snoop around, take a peek, but in tribal homelands is the thing that you seek."
The tribal homelands? I kind of look at this as an awesome thing to get sent to Exile this early in the game.
I just have to figure out where the tribal homelands are. "Also you have a choice before you.
At the end of your stay at Exile, you can return to the tribe you just left or you can join the other tribe.
This is a big decision. It has potential to turn this game on its head." That it does.
The second note was saying that I had the ability to switch tribes. No chance, no chance I'll go
to Jalapao.
Let me see it. I just want to see what it looks like.
...with writing on it. I'm gonna go take a walk, though.  Do you want me to help you
find it? It's yours.  You can walk with me, yeah.  Yeah, I don't want to sit
here by myself. I'm working Brendan to give myself a chance to find the idol.
So I'm like trying to be real nice. I'm playing up the friendly aspect because when my tribe
found out who my husband actually is-- Eddie George from the NFL-- I could just tell that they were thinking,
"Well, she doesn't need this. We need it." Everybody thinks they have a great cause.
Hell, my cause is I want it and I'm going to stay here and get it.
"If you want to be safe, snoop around, take a peek, but in the tribal homelands is the thing that you seek."
 Does that make any sense?  I think our homelands are where we live.  Oh, you're right.
At that point, when I realized the idol was somewhere back at the tribe camps, I was thinking there's two hidden immunity
idols. There's one in our camp, and one in Jalapao's camp, and it's not the same idol that Sierra
was looking for. Do you have, like, a buddy on your team?  I haven't really bonded with
anyone yet. So we have to bond.  Seriously, I'm all for that.  We have to bond.
 So when you go back, will you tell other people it's in your homeland?  Probably not.
See, I'm thinking I need to save myself from my tribe.  Yeah. I'm an entrepreneur, and
having your own business, you have to make people understand who you are and make them feel that, you know what, we can
work together. And Taj and I created a great bond that could be very helpful for both of us if we do get to
the merge. So if we do rendezvous later in the game, I think we will have a relationship in place.
The goal is that we both get to get sent back here.  That's perfect.  Hopefully, that will give us
the next clue where it is in our homeland. So we need to work together.  Yeah.
 Does that work?  That works for me. We're going to try it.  That works?
 Oh, yeah.
 You guys, this is really good.  You got a big chunk out of your elbow right there.
 That's where that young kid tackled me, man.  I am shocked at that little old lady.
 Yeah, they almost drowned me at one point.  It was a very tough challenge, and it got really
physical. So when we lost, I was very disappointed. I hate to lose because
somebody is going home.  Honestly, I didn't see Coach playing that hard. He barely tackled anyone.
He didn't fight to get free. We need action, not words.  I feel like I'm dealing with one of the, like, church women
at my church that go every Sunday and wear these hats, but they ain't on the up-and-up. That's what I feel like, you
know. Coach is not excelling physically in the way that I thought he would.
And at the end of the day, I really don't see, like, what all Coach is bringing to the table except a lot of talk.
 You know what I mean, big-time right now. I don't know. I just... I don't like to be
around negativity, and if we've got negative going on in the group, it's going to be really tough for me.
 This kind of stuff that you're telling me makes me worried because who would go?  I thought earlier we'd all
decided Sierra.  Yeah, I know, but what I'm thinking is this: I do want the strong people to be here,
but I mean the poisoned apple needs to go because it's going to ruin the bunch. At first I thought I'm going
with the plan and vote for Sierra, and now Candace is... boy, talk about cancer on the team.
Just the negative attitude, I think everybody's pretty much fed up with it. And, you know, sometimes there
is addition by subtraction. She got on me. She's going to get on everybody. The cancer will ruin the tribe.
 Oh, man, my man!  Hey!  All right!  Oh, my God.
 How you doing, man?  Good.  What's going on, big guy?  Have you eaten anything?
 Yeah, we had rice. We got a fire. We slept outside. And it's just this giant dune
that comes out of the middle of nowhere.  So how did you both look for the idol at the same time?
 There's two urns...  Uh-huh.  You each get to pick an urn, and mine was empty and hers
had a clue. And I was setting up camp. She went back up, came back down, but she never really said
if she got it or not.  You didn't charm the clue out of her?  I don't know; she is clearly
on the outs with her tribe.  Really?  You think?  Yeah, that's what she said.
The idol is actually under everybody's nose in camp. I don't want to let that out of the bag yet.
It's one very general clue, and that's too broad. So you know, I'll be patient and just hope the clues keep
falling into my lap.
 Who's that somebody going to be?
 Oh, yeah. Like, he's a big guy, and he looks like he's in good shape, but I just haven't seen it yet.
 But, I mean, I don't know how soon we can do it. I don't know if this Council, it might be too soon.
 Yeah.  I think if we just stay chilled and let him keep digging his hole.
 Yeah.  So then the sad part is somebody has to go.  Yeah.
 Everyone has their strengths and their weaknesses. We just need to do what makes the team stronger.
 You're right about that.  What do you think, Coach?
 The original plan when we walked into camp was to go with Sierra.  Okay, got it.
I didn't know how original we were talking. I'm like, wait a minute. Is there a new original plan?
 We're going to Tribal Council. And the girls think that everybody is voting for
Sierra, but for me, the obvious choice is Candace. She's just a cancer on the tribe.
I've been looking forward to this elimination. I think it's good. I think it's what we need.
So hopefully, Candace has her bags packed because she's out of here.
 How about you?  Yeah, that... She crossed my mind. Sierra was on my mind at first.
 Coach, he wants to get rid of Candace. You know, I didn't necessarily think he was right.
In the challenge yesterday, as hard as Sierra played, I think that she's just too small for something like that.
Every time I saw her, she was trying her hardest, but somebody was holding her down. So I think there's going to be
some challenges that probably would suit Candace better than they would Sierra. We need to keep the strongest,
happiest tribe we can.  Yeah.
 I will not vote you off tonight.  I feel like it's my time, it's my time.
 I'm going to tell you something. I make my living off of people trusting me.
So you just have to be cool and relax.  Coach told me I wasn't going to get voted out, but I know
that my whole tribe, from the beginning, wanted to vote me off, so I'm freaking out a little bit about that.
 Stop worrying.  I'm not worrying.  You are worrying. You can't say you're not
worrying. I know you're worrying.  I am not comfortable at all. I still have not found the
hidden immunity idol. So, I'm still looking behind my back.
 That's a long time for people to be rallying.  Mm-hmm.
 I don't know.  Okay, let's think about this. You and I are both strong.  Yeah.
 The guys have been talking about voting Sierra off for days.  Okay, I worry about the fact
that, like, if anybody strays a little bit, like...  Listen, I'm going to tell you right now.
It ain't you or me. They know what we're worth. As far as I know, it's Sierra going home.
And if it's not, then there's mad shadiness going on around this tribe.  Yeah.
 Everybody trying to figure it out.  And this is just the beginning.
 I know it.
 PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach the flame, dip it in,
and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because, in this game, fire represents your life.
As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you.
Let's go back to the very beginning. Sierra, based on very little information, you were voted out
of this tribe. What was going through your mind at that moment?  Um, a part of me wanted to
give up for a second. It was written all over my face that I was sick, so I automatically looked weak from
the get-go. So I think their vote was valid.  PROBST: Tyson, what was your reaction to Sierra?
 She kind of looked miserable on the truck. I didn't see her pull anything off.
I didn't see her gather very much. She seemed to be struggling in the heat and didn't seem very
happy, so...  PROBST: Candace, how much time was spent talking about Sierra and why everybody voted
for her?  Honestly, there was a little bit of resentment because it was such a difficult trek and she
was taking a helicopter ride. And I think she really wasn't that excited to be here or wanted to be here as much as
everyone else.  PROBST: And what do you think the vibe is on you, overall?
 I think I'm vibing with the group, but it's like, you never know. I mean, sometimes I talk a
lot, and maybe that might be misinterpreted. We're all different. It's hard to tell.
 PROBST: Coach, do you think anybody would tell you this early in the game if you didn't mesh?
 At this point, you got to go with your intuition. And if you're clashing with somebody, you've got to sense
that on your own because I guess at this stage, nobody is going to tell you that.  PROBST: Let's talk a little
about Exile Island. Brendan, how was Exile?  Um, it wasn't exactly luxurious by any means, but it
was a cool experience to go check out and have a chance to kind of go there with Taj and go through the process of Exile.
 PROBST: So, Coach, how curious was everybody about Brendan's stay on Exile?  Right off the bat, he said
there were two jars, and one of them had a clue to look for the idol and the other one didn't. He didn't get the clue.
And that's somebody that I respect and trust and I believe 100% when he tells me something.  PROBST: Jerry, are you
surprised how quickly trust is a major issue in this game? You barely know these people.  Jeff, yes, trust is a major
issue in this game. Because if you can win the trust of over half the tribe, then you'll be here for a while.
But if you can't win the trust, your time here is going to be limited.  PROBST: Hard to make a vote
this early on?  It's really hard to make a vote this early on. I've bonded with this group of
individuals so closely, and we've got to know each other real, I mean, real well.  PROBST: Erinn, what are you
reacting to?  We can talk all day about how much we all get along and this, that and the other thing,
but we don't know these people. We've known them for six days. But I don't know if the person I've bonded with is who you
really are. I just think we need to be careful.  I have to disagree with
Erinn. We're not at the Holiday Inn. We are out there surviving together.
That trek that we went through, to me that's how you really get to know someone.  But I don't know that that's
how you get to trust someone.  Well, I've already built trust. I've built trust with several
people on this tribe.  PROBST: All right, it is time to vote. Tyson, you're up.
 You played a great physical game, but nobody wants a snake in the grass.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
 PROBST: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
All right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Candace.
Sierra. One vote Candace; one vote Sierra.
Candace. Two votes Candace; one vote Sierra. Candace.
That's three votes Candace; one vote Sierra.
Candace. Four votes Candace; one vote Sierra.
Second person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Candace. That's five. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Candace, the tribe has spoken.
Well, your first Tribal Council, your first blindside. Congratulations. Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT

 PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on Survivor: The tribes are hit hard.  Push it!
 Let's go! Move! (screaming)  PROBST: And Taj makes a secret alliance.
 We would have a four-way alliance that nobody knows about.  That nobody knows about.
 Exactly.  They won't even know what's coming. (laughing)
 I'm surprised. I'm really pissed off. I worked really hard. I worked in the challenges.
I worked on camp. And I did everything I could to try to make Timbira stronger. And I thought that that was the
goal. But I guess this is more like day camp. In the long run, I was an asset
and they're going to need me.
