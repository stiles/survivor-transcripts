 JEFF PROBST: This is Brazil, known for its beautiful people, the world's greatest soccer, spectacular beaches, and the
most vibrant and dynamic cities in the world. But for these 16 Americans, their adventure will play out in
one of the most deserted and unforgiving sections of Brazil: Tocantins. The temperatures in this high
desert are brutal and can top 120 degrees. (thunder rumbling) And sudden storms can ignite
dangerous wildfires in an instant. This vast region covers over 100,000 square miles and is one
of the most isolated places on earth. The rivers, if you can find them, provide the only source of
water, but you'll have to share it with every other wild animal trying to survive. (roaring)
(hooting) They've traveled for days to get here. They've already been divided
into two tribes: Jalapao in red, and Timbira in black. And although no one has spoken to each other, first impressions
are already forming.  Tall, spiky hair, model boy. Love him. He just seems like a good guy to
have around.  The younger brunette-- she comes off to me as kind of being the bitch.
 We have the strung-out old lady, and it is sort of encouraging to have her because you know you're not going to be
the first to go.  The real tall boy-- I think he's like a geek. I think I should be able to lead
him around real easy.  I've been sick. I got some bad tonsils. I've been trying to hide it so
I don't get voted off.  This blond-- I have an unfortunate feeling she's going to crumble.
 PROBST: They come from different walks of life-- 16 Americans forced to work together to create a new society
while battling the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out.
In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. 39 days, 16 people,
one survivor.

 PROBST: Welcome to  Survivor: Tocantins. You guys ready to get this game started?
 Oh, yeah.  Yes!  Let's go.  PROBST: We have our two
tribes: Jalapao in red, Timbira in black. Now you're going to get your first chance to work together.
This truck is loaded with supplies that will make your stay here in Brazil a bit easier.
You will have 60 seconds to gather as much as you can. Your time starts now 'cause this game is on.
 Come on.  Get down. I'll hand this to you.  Right here! Right here!
 Hey, get down, dude.  Do it right here, right here.  Here you go, come on.  Yeah, we got 'em now.
 I got 'em. I got 'em.  Incoming. (woman yells) (overlapping chatter)
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right, here we go.  PROBST: Everything you can get your hands on.
 Go, go...  PROBST: If for no other reason than to make sure the other tribe doesn't get it.
 Ooh.  PROBST: Don't break it. It's no good broken.  Do it.
(grunting)  Yeah, right here.  Come on, come on. Water's the most important.
 PROBST: Ten seconds left.  Flag's right here. Flag's right here. > Hand me the water!
Hand me the water!  PROBST: Five, four.  Let go.  PROBST: Three, two...
one. That's it! Everybody off.
All right, first impressions. Guy in the black shirt. What did you notice about your tribe?
 It seemed like we all knew what we were going to get. We got all the water. We got all beans.
We got everything we needed.  PROBST: Did you realize that? You guys have no water, and you didn't get any of the bags of
food.  Yeah, we, uh... We'll be all right. We'll make do.
 PROBST: Take a look around. Brazilian Highlands. Beautiful part of Brazil, but extremely harsh.
It's 110 right now, and it's early. You are going to be hot. You're going to get wet.
Here's a map and a compass to your new home.
It's about a four-hour trek... (gasps and scoffs) ...to your camp. You've got a lot of stuff to
carry, and it's about to get just a little bit more difficult. We're going to have our first
vote. And one person from each tribe is not going to make this journey.
 Game on. Let's play it hard right from the beginning. Let's get rid of the weak
players even before we start, and this is going to set the tone for the whole time.  PROBST: Very little
information to base this vote on. First impressions go a long way in this game.
All right, one at a time. We're going to reveal votes. We're going to start with Jalapao.
 I wrote down Grammy.  PROBST: Who's Grammy?  Grammy's going to be the old... the older lady.
 PROBST: What's your name?  Sandy.  PROBST: Sandy.  Two for Sandy.
 PROBST: Okay, that's two for Sandy.  Guy with glasses in peachy orange shirt.
 Stephen.  PROBST: Stephen. That's two for Sandy; one vote for Stephen.
 Three for Sandy.  PROBST: That is three for Sandy.  The older lady. For Sandy.
I'm sorry.  PROBST: That is four for Sandy, one for Stephen.  Older lady, Sandy.
I'm sorry.  PROBST: That's five. There's only eight. Five is enough.
Sandy, over here with me. Sandy, you can't be happy about this.  I'm pissed.
I am so pissed. Obviously, I didn't know it was going to be like this, as far as them being able to vote
before, you know, we got to know each other or whatever. But I bet one of the youngest ones drops out first.
We'll see who can handle the heat.  PROBST: All right, Timbira. Let's see what damage you've
done.  I said gray and black striped T-shirt. She just looked really hot on
the trip.  PROBST: What's your name?  Sierra.  PROBST: Sierra.
That's one for Sierra.  Zebra-striped top.  PROBST: Two for Sierra. You look shocked already,
Sierra.  Yeah, well, I have strep throat. So, I got it three days ago, and
I'm on antibiotics right now, so...  Sierra. Sorry.  PROBST: Sierra.
That is three for Sierra.  Purple tank with the ruffles?  PROBST: What's your name?  Erinn.
 PROBST: That's three votes Sierra; one vote Erinn.  Blond girl with jeans and striped shirt.
 PROBST: That is four for Sierra. One more, and you're out, Sierra.
 Young lady, blonde, with the black and white blouse-- Sierra.  PROBST: Sierra, that's five. That's enough.
Head over. Sierra, you look angry and shocked.  I think I could have brought
a lot to this team. Um, I'm sorry I have a fever of 102, but if that's your choice, fine by me.
 PROBST: Well, let's be clear. I said you will not take part in this  adventure. (gasping)
This adventure is a four-hour trek to camp. (laughter, Sandy screams) You guys both made very strong
first impressions. The good news is, you get a chance to change those impressions because while
these guys are trekking for four hours, carrying all of the camp supplies, you're going to fly to camp in a helicopter.
 Thank you, God!  PROBST: I wouldn't be celebrating, Sandy. This is a game about social
integration. You have been outcast immediately. This wasn't even close.
Smiles is not what I'd be doing. I'd be thinking about, how do I start working to change an impression that I have given
these guys? You guys have a long journey ahead of you. You need to get to camp.
You need to start working on shelter.  All right.  Let's take some.
(helicopter blades whirring)
 PROBST: All right, you guys have some work to do if you want to stay in this game. Bird's coming in.
Head on over. Have a good flight. (grunts)  Yoo-ha!
(bird screeching)  Has anybody ever wanted to come to Brazil?  Yes!
 Yeah, definitely.  This thing is getting heavy.  Hey, you guys, hold up. Wait for us!
 My partial motivation for being here is to get rid of the rest of the my baby weight.  I like it.
 I got you. I got you.  I'm gonna melt it off in this damn heat.  Work that off, girl!
 I am 19 years old. As far as I know, I'm the youngest contestant ever on Survivor.
And I am obsessed with it. I have watched every season. And I love the physical aspect. I like the challenges.
But the trek was treacherous. It-It was hot. The sun was high. It was not easy, by any means.
 Are we going the right way, Joe?  Is this way okay?  Uh, hold up, J.T. Hold on.
Let's just make sure we're going the right way. Are you all cool with that?  Okay.
 You know how to read that, right?  Remember the compass always faced north.
 Compass 101.  You want to put the compass...  Yeah, so it faces north.
 ...down with the map so it faces north.  Well, we can't do that, 'cause it's always going to
face that way.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Turn that map like that.
 We're trading places.  There you go.  Yes.  I'm J.T., I'm 24 years old,
and I'm from Samson, Alabama. I manage a Black Angus cattle ranch. I'm in hot weather every day,
so I'm accustomed to the weather and mosquitoes, things of that nature.  All you do is find 112 and
line it up.  I mean, it's right... literally right at the notch.  I know I'm going to be good
at catching fish. And I know I'm going to be good at providing, but that'll also put me out in front of everybody
else as a threat eventually. The biggest challenge for me is going to be fitting in with the people.
 What happened to your leg?  No, just from the water...  Yeah, you have a hole in your pants.
 Oh, yeah, my ass is ripped.  Got some booty hanging out on the first day.  You know, this is going to be
nice for the ladies back home. When I saw at least one, sort of good, old-fashioned Southern boy, I thought I'm a little bit
screwed. Don't really see us connecting on too many levels. I don't know how much he's going
to like the anxious New York Jew.  The farther we walk north is going to be farther.
So, if we're veering to the left, we're cutting the whole corner off.  It's a good point.
 Yeah. Fair enough?  I'm not trying to be bossy or anything.  No, I like it.
If it gets us there sooner, do it.  If it gets us to Sandy sooner, I am all for that.
 To Sandy.  Sandy.  Psycho Sandy.  Perfect.
 Yeah, follow J.T.  Just kind of keep me lined up, Joe.  Yeah.

 Come on, guys. We can do it.
 This is hard.
 Yeah. What the hell am I doing out here? I'm a hairstylist.
The last time I went camping, I was maybe in the seventh grade. (screams)  Sorry, sorry.
 Are you okay?  (laughing): Yeah.  Break time?  We had a mishap.
 Dude, what else do you do to stay in shape?  Eat potato chips, watch TV. (laughing)
 No, seriously. You gotta do something else.  I work out. I go to the gym.
 Yeah?  Yeah, I go to a gym. I just got back from Afghanistan on a 12-month tour.
I'm with the South Carolina Army National Guard. And I am a first sergeant. I have 100 men under me.
I stay pretty active. And I know how to give orders. But in  Survivor,  everybody has their own individual mind, so
I'm going to try to keep it low-key as I can because I don't want to be in charge. If you're in charge, you don't
last too long.  Here's where we started.  Head 91 degrees east.  And we have to go all the way
until we find...  All the way until we find a palm tree.  I consider myself a
Renaissance man/adventurer. I'm a university head soccer coach, and the polar opposite of that is that I'm the conductor
and artistic director of a symphony in Northern California. We're going to go there, stop, look at the compass, look at the
map again. I'm always used to being a leader, by inspiring, pulling out the best in everybody
because as we all know, a team is only as good as its weakest player. I want to tell you something.
I want to change this game. It's survival of the weakest. It's survival of the people that can't survive in the wild, and
you and I can change this game by making the strong survive. If we look back at our ancestors, whether it be
American Indian, whether it be the Norse Vikings, whether it be the samurai warrior, they prayed for an opponent that was worthy
enough to defeat them, and died with honor and glory in the battle. So, I know I'm making myself
honorable to you by letting it that out of the bag first. But that's what I'm talking about... you and me change the
game.  Coach, like right away, he came in and said, "I want to tell you how I'm playing this
game." But it kind of throws up a red flag being, one, is he lying, and two, we're here to play and
to win a game, and I don't think any of us wants a coach in that process.  Iron sharpens iron, baby.
Say, let's rock 'n' roll, okay.  All right, let's go.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

 My tribe had to, like, travel by foot and, you know, I got to ride in the helicopter, but I couldn't take it all in
because I was still pissed, because the first thing they want to do is get rid of the-the old gal.
Oh, wow. I'm glad I'm here first. And then they can't see me, uh, with the emotion of the first
vote. It scared me so bad. But now I'm-I'm gonna... I'm gonna make it to 39 days.
I'm going to show 'em. Because maybe I am the older woman, but I'm older and I'm wiser.

seen, you know, the supplies or whatever, some wood laying there and-and stuff and rope, I thought I can go back there and
try to make up this camp, you know, that they probably won't even like anyway because it's... a woman made it.
And it still ain't going to keep my name off that piece of paper. So I'm going to look for the idol.

hurtful. But, um, they don't know me at all. I bring a lot, a lot of good

Your tribe chose to leave you behind." Thanks a lot. "You can start setting up camp
or you can use this time to search for a hidden immunity idol, which would guarantee your safety the first time
Timbira goes to Tribal Council. So what do you do?"
People may think this is a really stupid idea, but, um... I'm going to continue to build my camp.
They say that first impressions are everlasting but, hopefully, I'll change their opinion of me. Yeah, I could go and try to look
for an immunity idol and protect my butt, but my prerogative is looking good in the eyes of my crew.
I mean, if you don't redeem yourself, I'm pretty much in the doghouse forever.  Have you seen a tarantula
yet, J.T.?  Not yet. You will know when I see a tarantula.
 I guess we're going the right way. Keep going.
 Tell me you see the flag.  I see it.  Whoo! Finally!
 Jalapao!  Before sundown.  There is a god! (distant chattering)
 Oh, no, my tribe's here. I gotta hide this note.
 Whoo!  Sandy!
 They look even?  Sandy? Is that you? (laughter)
 Hi, Sandy!  Hi.  Whoo! Hi!
I'm so sorry.
 Look. Look at this. Look at this.  We had just trekked four hours carrying pots and
watermelons, and then we get here and it's, like, Sandy didn't do anything. And I was just like, great.
You've been chilling here, and I still gotta do stuff.  I don't care what you call me as long as you keep me on your
tribe. Everybody was kind of just all laughs and smiles, and they had just all written my name down.
But, you know, screw you. Because, you know, the bottom line is this... when we go to Tribal Council, you're going to
write down my name again. Now, why the hell do I even want to waste my energy on trying to get in your good graces when I
wasn't even ever there... it wasn't an option. You all are here. Okay, yes, and look...
 How do you say our name?  I know said "Jalapeño."  Jalapeño.  I know when what I have to
do, and that's find that idol. I'd like to outwit them or, you know, trick 'em one time, at least let 'em write down my name

 Thank you.  So you guys, all I want to say is I was kind of really sick and I was hiding it because I
thought it was a weakness. Yeah, I probably would've voted for myself not knowing what was wrong with me because I did
look like I was tired.  But you couldn't have done what we did today.  I couldn't because I have a
fever.  Sierra, she's a great, sweet kid. She's got a sweet spirit.
She did do a lot of work and, of course, we appreciate that.  Did it change anything when you found out that I was sick?
Did it make sense?  Yeah, yeah, no, it did. Yeah, it made a big difference.  But, you know, let's face it:
you can't change what we did together as a tribe. It bonded all of us, and, unfortunately, you know, Sierra

We haven't got our floor done, but it's gonna get better. We're going to work on it a little more.
 You need to get this one back up there, and the good thing about it is, we'll have extra left so we can, like, either
make a chair or put, like, a wall up.  Do you think that's going to be worth it?

then relax. It's hard for me to keep my opinions to myself, but I'm hoping that my tribe really
understands that shelter is extremely important and that we buckle down and get that going.  So what I'm going to do-- I'm
going to go use the restroom, and then I'm going to take up anything I think we might need. I don't know.

 Wow.  I'm probably more of a free spirit.  Well, he doesn't want his
clothes wet for the challenge. (Sierra screaming) (Sierra laughs)  Having somebody that can make
you laugh in an environment like this where everybody is dirty and tired-- I think people appreciate that.
 Oh, my God.  You can look if you want...  It's your show, Tyson.  But when it comes down to it,

 PROBST: Come on in, guys. Guys ready to get to your first challenge?  Yes.
 Yes.  Oh, yeah.  PROBST: For today's challenge, six members of each
tribe will race across a series of sand hills and into the river. You must then retrieve your raft
loaded with puzzle planks. Once you have the raft back to shore, you'll untie the ropes, release puzzle planks.
You'll then race those puzzle planks back to the start where the two remaining tribe members will use those puzzle planks to
build a staircase. Each puzzle plank is different and must be placed at the corresponding step.
Once you have all your tribe members to the top of the staircase, any two tribe members must work together to navigate a
peg through a table maze, allowing you to release your tribe's flag. First tribe to raise their flag
wins. Want to know what you're playing for?  Yes.
 Please.  PROBST: First of all, you are playing for fire.  Ooh!
(whooping)  Wow!  PROBST: Fire in the form of flint.
In addition, you are playing for the most important thing in this game.  Oh, wow.
 Wow!  PROBST: Immunity.  Oh.  PROBST: Immunity guarantees
you cannot be voted out. Worth playing for?  Yes, sir.  PROBST: Give you a minute to
strategize, and we will get started. Building a staircase for Jalapao: Taj and Sandy.
Building the staircase for Timbira: Sierra and Erinn. Everybody else is running. Here we go.
For fire and immunity... survivors ready? Go! (overlapping chatter)

Let's go! Red, you're good. Black, you're good. Start untying those planks and
get them back to the start.  Just slide them out.  Let's go.  PROBST: Joe heading back for
Jalapao.  Come on, Joe!  PROBST: Tyson taking a big heavy load for Timbira.
 Good job, Tyson!  Come on, Joe!  Joe.  Come on, Joe.
 On the mat or on the wood?  Just put it right here.  PROBST: Carolina and Sydney struggling.
 Are there any planks left?  BOTH: No.  This is all?  PROBST: Once all the planks
are back, you can start working on that staircase.  Good job, guys. No slowing down.
 PROBST: Timbira has all of theirs. It's 120 degrees today. Already taking its toll.
Three days in Brazil, and people are struggling.  Under that or on that? It seems it's got to be on the
other end.  Set that one over there.  PROBST: Timbira, start working on your staircase.
 Okay, go.  PROBST: Jalapao, you've got to get your last planks back.  Come on, kids, there you go.
Y'all bring me some planks, baby.  PROBST: Jalapao, start working on it.
Everybody's working on their staircase. (overlapping chatter)  Okay. Okay.
One, one.  PROBST: Sandy and Taj working it for Jalapao. Erinn and Sierra working it for
Timbira.  Okay, I need three wide on the left.  PROBST: Jalapao starting to
pull ahead a little bit.  On the right.  The next, get three and three.
 PROBST: Erinn and Sierra not panicking, though. Keeping their calm, taking their time.
Sierra getting involved now for Timbira.  This one's next!  PROBST: Sandy calling the
shots for Jalapao. The two people nobody wanted are now leading their tribes.  It's the three-three,
no spaces. That's it.  PROBST: Jalapao increasing their lead now.
 Okay, try this one! Erinn.  Give me another board!  PROBST: Jalapao with their
last piece.  That's it!  Let's go!  PROBST: Sandy and Taj giving
Jalapao a huge lead.  Right here, right here, right here, right here.  Oh, it's very lumpy.
It's going to float.  PROBST: Jalapao working on the final table maze.  Pull yours down.
Let's see. Pull yours down.  PROBST: Sierra fighting hard to keep her tribe in it.  We got it.
Give me another one!  PROBST: You're very close, Timbira, very close. Hold it, guys.
 Yeah, there you go. There you go.  Don't let 'em!  PROBST: Timbira, two steps
away from being back in it.  You guys got it.  PROBST: Timbira completes their staircase.
Two people inside. A tough first challenge with immunity on the line. Timbira working well together.
Erinn and Brendan moving quickly through this maze.  Back. Your back.  No, this way's wrong.
 PROBST: Both Spencer and Sydney struggling a little bit.  Keep it high. Keep it high like that.
 PROBST: Timbira has erased the lead Jalapao had. We're very even right now.  Find now.
Find the rail first.  It's the middle road. The middle road on this next turn.
 PROBST: Immunity on the line. Nobody wants to go to Tribal Council. Nothing good ever happens at
Tribal Council.  It's hot. It's hot.  PROBST: Timbira now with a bit of a lead, if they are
right.  Hold it out.  Take your time.  PROBST: Timbira very close.
 Take your time.  PROBST: Brendan and Erinn can smell it.  Take your time.
 PROBST: First challenge, the first win is this close.  Bring 'em up!  Four, three, two, one.
 PROBST: That's it! (screaming and cheering) Timbira wins immunity!  Yeah!
(screams and indistinct chatter)  One, two, three!  Timbira!  PROBST: Timbira,
congratulations. Fire.  Yeah!  Fire.
 PROBST: That will make camp life a lot easier, right?  Yes.  PROBST: And immunity.
 Yeah, right!  PROBST: No Tribal Council for Timbira. Nobody going home.
Jalapao, bad news for you guys. Tribal Council tonight. The first person will be voted out of this game, and it's
coming from your tribe. You will have the afternoon to figure out who it's gonna be. Head back to camp.
 That's sweet!  We got... (indistinct)  Tribal Council was the one thing that I was dreading
because I don't want to vote for Sandy. I mean, she worked her ass off at the challenge.
But I don't know who else to vote for.  Anybody want to go to the water real quick?
 Yeah.  Yeah.  The water.  The water.
 The challenge-- it was just heartbreaking. The vote's for Sandy, unfortunately.
But with every failure, there's an opportunity for growth. That's one of my #1 sayings. What can our tribe do better at
camp? Maybe we could be a little bit more organized.
 Like our shelter. You know, it...  You know, it's the stuff like that, we'd love to just do it
all at once, but we're dehydrated and hungry and human.  Oh, I totally agree. I totally agree.
But it's just, like, you know, like, and the... You know, when it gets a little cooler today, let-let's wrap it
up, so, like...  But how would that help us in challenges?  I'm just making a suggestion.
 Oh, I know. Don't... Don't get defensive. Just listen for a second.  Yeah. We're all gonna say
something.  So, you know, when we first came back, we're hot, we're exhausted, we're lost, and the
first thing you're going to tell somebody is you need to clean up. Clean up the outdoors?!
Are you kidding me? Basically, I just... And I mean, you can listen. I don't care.
But I just wanted to tell you. Sometimes you panic a bit, and you get whiny.  Oh, I know.
 You need to curb that because it's only going to cause tension in the group.  Yeah.
 It's just going to cause frustration.  I totally agree. I'm just telling you my
viewpoint, and I totally agree.  No. I know, I know, and that's why I'm pulling you aside so you can understand.
I'm not going to tell anybody else; I'm going to tell you.  Yeah. No, I agree.  So you can completely
understand what I'm talking about.  Taj called me out, and she was right.
When it comes to, like, working or getting things done, you know, I can get very opinionated and do speak my mind.
 All right...  Now, like, I've just been thinking about checking myself. (hooting)
 I know, dude, right.  I mean, unless everybody else is just dead set on getting rid of Sandy-- which I would
disagree with-- I'm wholeheartedly campaign Sandy or whatever we want. My first impression of Sandy was
that she might be a liability in challenges, but she proved today that, you know, not so much.
She did a great job. She's really into this, and it's kind of like, why should we just-just based on first
impressions, sort of, and for no other reason, just kind of get rid of her?  Just so you know what
happened and what this means for Council or not, we get back to the water, the first thing that, uh, Caroline starts talking
about is how we need to finish stuff around camp.
 Um...  And honestly, I don't know if Sandy outperformed her. It was different tasks...
 Yeah.  ...but I don't think... I don't think Caroline stuck out ahead of her.
Between Sandy and Caroline, it's kind of a tricky decision, being that it's pretty close as to how they'll perform in future
challenges and how they'll add to the morale of the camp. The first option is obviously Sandy, just based on how old
she is. But, uh, Caroline can be very bossy, and it's gotten worse. So, in this environment, that
bossy streak will get old really quick.
 I just feel bad 'cause I feel like you and I, like, when I put down that "older lady" from that vote.
 Yeah, yeah.  I felt like, you know, I know that hurt your feelings, and when I realized that it did,
like, I genuinely felt really bad.  Right. You know.  And I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry for, like, yesterday.  Yeah, yeah. Me too.  Yeah, yeah.
But that's okay. You know, you don't have to be sorry, you know, or anything, but, um, you know, if I'm the
one to go, then that's just the way it is. I'm glad I'm here today, and I'm hoping I'm going to be here
tomorrow. But I believe my tribe is voting for me. So, um, I'm going to look for
that idol. I'm definitely going to figure out what ten paces are, and I'm going to dig this time under
anything and everything, I guess.
 PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in
and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because in this game, fire represents your life.
As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you.
That will be the case for one of you tonight. All right, let's go back to the beginning.
Sandy, within the first five minutes, you were voted out of your tribe based on the first impression that you were simply
too old.  Well, I guess I summed it up with the first response when I said, "I'm pissed," because,
you know, I've got my heart in this game, and I want to stay in this game.  PROBST: J.T., what are you
guys talking about in regards to Sandy? You already voted her out. Now, she gets a free ride back
to camp.  Well, we did that strategically to try to make the group stronger.
That was our point of view. We hoped she'd be at least rounding up wood or get a camp picked out when we got there.
We didn't really know what to expect.  PROBST: So, Sydney, you had an expectation she better be at
camp doing something.  Definitely, and she definitely greeted us with open arms, but the next day, was a
little different than I thought she was going to be. She didn't really do much around camp.
She was going off by herself a lot.  PROBST: Sandy, let's explore that for a minute.
It seems like after everything you went through on day one, the expectation would be, on day two that you got some recovering
to do.  Sure, but I wanted to collect my thoughts and get all that out of my head so that I could go
back into them with nothing but positive, which I did.  PROBST: And so, are you trying to figure out, "Okay,
they're seeing me as an old lady?"  Oh, I know.  PROBST: So do you start
thinking, "How do I change that perception?"  No, because I'm the old lady, no matter what.
But an old lady can also fit into this tribe of all these kids that could be mine. (laughter)
 PROBST: Sandy, you a little crazy?  Oh, I'm a lot crazy. Yeah.
 PROBST: So you're used to people looking at you and kind of going, "Hmm. Not sure. Kind of amusing, a little odd."
 Mm-hmm. That's how it happens with me. I don't know why, but I like it.  PROBST: Carolina, is it fair
to vote out Sandy just because she's old? She can't change that.  I don't necessarily think
that it's fair, but I felt like our team voted smart. And we could explain it 100 times, but it is what it is.
 PROBST: What do you think the first impression of you was?  I'm very boisterous, so I'm not afraid to say my opinion.
And I could say that I came across a little demanding to get things done. Sometimes, my directness comes
across like maybe a little whiny, and I need to check myself before I speak, and I openly admit that.
 PROBST: All right, it is time to get to the vote. J.T., you're up.
 Carolina, I hope you're going to be the first one voted out and not me.
 Sorry, Sandy.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Sandy.
Carolina.
Carolina. That's two votes Carolina; one vote Sandy.
Carolina. Three votes Carolina; one vote Sandy. Carolina.
That's four votes Carolina; one vote Sandy. First person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins:  Carolina.
 Wow.  PROBST: That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
Carolina, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.
Well, two things are very clear from tonight's Tribal Council: you're willing to change your first impressions, and you're
willing to blindside each other. Good news about coming to Tribal Council: you will go home with fire.
 Oh, thank you.  Oh, yes!  Yes!  Oh, yes!
 Whoa.  Thank you!  PROBST: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on Survivor: The game is on.  Hold on to it, Sierra!
 PROBST: J.T. not letting Tyson get rid of that ball. Candace trying to take Taj down.  Good job!
(indistinct chatter)  PROBST: Candace has it for Timbira. And one shot changes everything.
 I just got completely blindsided. I'm the first person voted off. I'm not going to lie.
Like, I'm pissed off. Like, this sucks. It's embarrassing. However, I'm going to be the
bigger person and wish them well. I think initially what got me voted off was my mouth.
You know, it's a lesson learned,
