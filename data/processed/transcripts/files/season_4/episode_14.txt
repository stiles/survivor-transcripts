         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 16
Americans began the adventure of
a lifetime.
Abandoned in the Marquesas,
thousands of miles from the
nearest continent, they quickly
formed first impressions.
 Sarah's arrival was almost
like Cleopatra, it was like the
servants are paddling and
lifting and she's sitting on the








crate looking so marvelous with
her boobs hanging out.
 PROBST: Their goal, to work
together to build a new society
while competing against one
another for the title of sole
Survivor and $1 million.
Without fire, water, or food,
they utilize the resources of
the land and their own survival
skills.
(rooster crowing)
 Did you hear that?
Listen.








Can you hear that gobbling?
Don't move.
It's a chicken, I swear to
God.
They can't fly, can they?
 This guy's moving.
Here's our lunch, guys, how does
it look?
 Well, that was slimy.
 PROBST: While some
relationships were quick to
form...
 I'm already in love with
Hunter.
 We fill this thing up and let
it cook in the sun all day
tomorrow...
 There you go.
 ...we've got a hot tub.
 That's an idea.
 I'm definitely attracted to
Rob, and him the same.
He's told me the same.
 PROBST: ...others were quick
to battle.
 I know, everything needs to
go back where you find it.
 Go back. I'm tired of...
where's the knife, then?
 I knew immediately that you
guys were talking... saying I
wasn't working.
 Please, don't be sensitive
about this...
 Apparently, I have to be.
 PROBST: And everybody had to
deal with the realities of a
harsh tropical landscape.
 I landed right on top of a
sea urchin.
I need somebody who can pee
on my hand.
That's supposed to be what
you're supposed to do for that
kind of venomous sting from a
sea urchin, is to urinate on it.
 PROBST: Go!
They were divided into two
tribes, Maraamu and Rotu.
They competed against one
another in challenges, but from
the outset, Rotu easily defeated
Maraamu.
Rotu, immunity. Who wants it?
Again...
Rotu, immunity!
...and again.
Rotu!
(cheering)
Maraamu was forced to vote out
three members in a row.
Hunter, one of the tribe's
strongest members, had harsh
words for his former tribe.
 I was camping with a bunch of
knuckle heads though, and I'll
tell you that to your face when
I see you again.
 PROBST: With Hunter gone,
Rob became Maraamu's self-
appointed leader.
 Fear keeps people loyal.
That's straight out of The
Godfather, it's true.
 PROBST: But a reshuffling of
the tribes sent the survivors
scrambling for new strategies.
Pick a disk, it doesn't matter,
it's totally random.
Swap out.
You're now a member of Rotu.
The new Maraamu was the obvious
underdog, but after an initial
loss, resulting in one tribe
member's departure, the tiny
tribe of three women and the
oldest male castaway came
roaring back to win three
challenges in a row.
Maraamu wins feast.
At Rotu, John led an alliance
with Tammy, Zoe and the General
that seemed destined to go to
the end.
 We made ourselves a little
pact that we're going to try to
control this and take it down to
be the final four people.
 If we do it right, the winner
will come out of this group.
 PROBST: After the alliance
claimed their first victim and
Maraamu lost one more member,
the two tribes merged on day 20
and a new tribe, Soliantu, was
born.
 One, two, three, Soliantu!
 PROBST: But the good cheer
and camaraderie quickly
disappeared, when an argument
broke out over voting
strategies.
 You included us!
You said all right, we're going
to go in seventh.
Everybody was like, "We a team,
we a team."
 PROBST: John's alliance voted
again as a block, and Boston
Rob was the seventh person voted
off the island.
Rob, the tribe has spoken.
 Good luck, guys.
 PROBST: Feeling vulnerable,
Neleh, Paschal, Sean, Vecepia
and Kathy came together and
decided to dismantle John's
alliance.
 I'm not going to go out fifth
or sixth.
We've worked too hard.
We've been here for too long and
worked too hard, and I'm not
going to go out like that.
 Obviously, Paschal and Neleh
started to see what I've been
talking about all along.
So now the new agreement we have
is myself, Neleh, V, Paschal and
Kathy.
We're going to vote John out
tonight.
 PROBST: John was voted out,
and the alliance was
systematically eliminated one by
one.
Only five survivors remained.
(shouting)
Last week, Kathy won immunity
and found herself caught between
two groups vying for her vote.
At a heated Tribal Council,
tempers flared, as Sean and
Paschal fought for Kathy's vote.
 That tells me a lot of what
Sean's been doing and thinking
and I think he's disingenuous.
 I don't think it was
disingenuous.
What I think is, five minutes
ago, I stick to my word.
 Listen once in a while,
instead of running your mouth
all the time.
 I'm listening! I'm listening!
 Okay.
 PROBST: In the end, Kathy
decided to align with Paschal
and Neleh to vote Sean out of
the tribe.
Sean, the tribe has spoken.
Only four remain-- Neleh,
Paschal, Vecepia, and Kathy.
Tonight they will compete
against each other in their
final immunity challenges.
Two will continue on to face the
jury, one will outlast all the
rest and become the sole
Survivor.
 Let me get some dry stuff.
I think they're a little wet.
It rained here, it feels like.
 There you go.
 Oh, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy.
It's that bad breath.
 It is that bad breath.
 Good job, you guys.
 That was an interesting
Tribal Council.
Good God. Whoo!
A lot of stuff brought out on
the table, it was funny.
I'm not okay with that vote.
Forget it. Nope.
Didn't like it.
Too much pressure.
Don't know if I did the right
thing.
Don't know if I made the right
decision for myself, so it was a
very odd situation.
I hated it.
I will not know if I made the
right decision last night until
two days from now.
 This is, I think, day 37.
Two days left.
We're right at the end.
We're all ready.
 Hopefully, the sun will come
out today and dry up everything
again.
 Get some dry clumps, 'cause
everything is wet out here.
 I feel good mentally.
Physically, I feel not as good.
Maybe it's the combination of my
age and I never did look real
good, but I look probably worse
than I've ever looked in my life
right now.
 You know, we're all just sick
of being here, so to avoid the
monotony and boredom you know,
you literally have to shut down
and go, "Stop thinking about the
bugs and that you're locked down
here and that you're so
uncomfortable and hungry and
tired."
You've got to stop thinking
about it.
♪ Show me the way to go home.
I'm tired and I want to go to
♪ bed
Well, I had a few drinks about
an hour ago
♪ And it went straight to my
head ♪
 It wasn't until, you know,
the last ten days of being out
here that I really felt super,
super close to Kathy, like, and
I just trust her 100% now, you
know?
I mean, she totally saved me
yesterday.
You know, if she would have went
with Sean and V, I would have
been voted on last night.
 Bring in the Marquesan ghosts
and spirits...
 She is going crazy!
 ... to lift us out of this
valley and bring us into town.
Confucius say we are going
crazy.
 Oh, man!
It's the game that's driving
me crazy.
 The game.
Maybe we should scream.
 Let's scream.
(screaming)
 That was great.
 I hate this place!
 I hate...
 Oh!
 I want to go home!
(screaming continues)
 I've had about enough of
these people, you know?
Love them, but I've had enough
of them. (chuckles)
I am the only one that has to
work at this because basically
if I win the immunity tonight
then I'll be here another night.
If I don't win immunity tonight,
I'll probably be the one to go.
So I am the only one that has to
work for the next two or three
days.
And I will work.
♪ Work, work... ♪
 Tree mail.
 Let's see if we've got
anything in here, guys.
 Tree mail, tree mail.
 Guess we have a book.
"16 have come, four are left, I
hope you've paid attention,
their hopes and dreams, their
place... of birth..."
 Oh?
 Yeah.
 "It's immunity for your
retention."
This is it, remember we were
talking about this?
 That's it.
I suspect the immunity
challenge is going to be
something having to do with the
personalities involved in this
game.
You know, where they're from,
what they do, what their dreams
are.
Why don't we go back and talk to
Kathy, compare notes.
 Kathy may know some of them.
 Even though this is a big
immunity, I want ya'll to know
as much as you can, too.
And I certainly don't know any
of that.
 I'm trying to think.
Okay, go ahead...
 See, I didn't know if they
would do it with four or three
or...
 I'd like to agree with that.
My voting options, if V wins
immunity is to either vote for
Kathy or vote for Neleh.
So to keep that from even being
remotely possible, I suggested
that everybody compare notes
because I thought it was fair.
Some of us haven't been with the
others.
 Kathy, we've got a book.
 As a matter of fact, I think
V may be the only one that's
been with everybody.
Where was Miss Patricia from?
South Carolina somewhere.
 Yeah, um, starts with an "L."
 I'm not going to sit there
and try to compare notes with
those guys.
This immunity is too important
for me.
I know where Patricia's from.
But that's why I said I think it
starts with an "L."
I know exactly where she's from.
One of the goals that I had
while I was here was to develop
a relationship with everyone and
know as much as I can about
them.
 Tammy wants to write her
book.
 Sarah we don't have a clue
about, she's from California.
So John... what's John's last
name?
See, those are some of the
details we don't have on
everybody, the small, little
details.
 The good thing about it is
that a lot of the stuff, I wrote
down in my little book.
 If it's a question-and-answer
situation, I think it will be
easier.
And I'm pretty good... I'm
pretty good about it.
Now I'm just weighing how good V
is.
 She wouldn't know Zoe.
 She knew Zoe a little bit.
 But she wouldn't know dreams.
 No.
 She wouldn't know Gabe.
We got to know Gina, and I got
to know Rob from the summit.
Who else doesn't she know here?
 Kathy may be a little worried
right now.
She put herself in a very
awkward position.
I mean, she got safe last night,
but then tonight either myself
or her have to win immunity in
order not to go home.
 We sort of got this down,
don't we?
All right, you guys, go win
immunity.
 Are you ready, Kitty Kat?
 I think so.
I've got to get my torch.
Put this stupid thing on.
 I feel great about going to
this Tribal Council.
I feel real good about the
possibility of winning immunity
if it's what I think it is.
This immunity is key.
Because whoever gets immunity,
they're going to be in the final
three.
Good luck, girl.
 Same to everybody.
I'm going to go in there.
I'm going to play the best
immunity game that I can.
If I don't win it, I know I'm
out of here, and so be it.
 PROBST: Go ahead and have a
seat and put your pads on your
lap.
I'll now bring in the members of
our jury.
Tonight's immunity challenge
will take place here at Tribal
Council, it will be followed
immediately with a vote in which
the 13th member of the tribe
will be voted out.
Tonight's immunity challenge
will test how well you've gotten
to know your fellow survivors.
I'm going to ask you a series of
questions that will be based
either on individuals you've all
lived with, who are no longer in
the game, or events that have
transpired in the past 37 days.
The first person to get to ten
points wins immunity.
Clear?
I'll take back the immunity
necklace.
Thank you.
The all-important immunity back
up for grabs.
First question, what was the
first immunity challenge that
Rotu lost?
And for an extra point, who did
they vote out?
Everybody reveal.
The correct answer is the S.O.S.
challenge and it was Gabe.
Paschal, V, Kathy, it wasn't the
tikis.
Neleh got both right.
So, she gets two points.
Paschal, V, Kathy each have one.
Next question, what is the name
of Sean's girlfriend?
 Gosh!
Okay, I need an answer, have
everybody reveal.
The correct answer is Ingrid.
Paschal, you're right.
V, you're right.
Kathy, you're right.
We're all tied up.
Everybody has two points.
Next question, whose dream job
is it to work for the New York
Times?
Okay. Reveal.
Tammy's right.
Everybody's right on this one.
Everybody gets a point.
We're still tied.
Everybody at three.

explanation for his absence
while he competed on Survivor?
Okay, everybody reveal.
The correct answer was he said
he was in the Army for training.
Paschal, you're right.
V, you're right.
Neleh, you're right.
Kathy, he wasn't on vacation in
Hawaii.
Paschal, V, Neleh tied at four.
Kathy, you have three.
Who was the 1997 National
Watermelon Seed Spitting
Champion?
Everybody ready?
Reveal.
Gina is right.
Everybody's right.
Paschal, V, Neleh, you each have

Halfway to victory.
Who does this necklace belong
to?
I'm going to pass it around.
Everybody reveal.
Tammy's right.
Everybody's right.
Paschal has 6, V has 6, Kathy
has 5, Neleh has 6.
How many siblings does Sean
have?
How many siblings does Sean
have?
Everybody reveal.
Zero is the correct answer.
Everybody is right except
Paschal.
V and Neleh are now leading with
seven each.
Paschal and Kathy, you're tied
at six.
Another personal item, whose
American flag belly ring is
this?
Does anybody want to see it?
Everybody ready?
Reveal.

fiance?
Okay. Reveal.
Mike is right.
Everybody's right.
Okay.
Neleh and V, you're both tied at

Kathy and Paschal, you're both
at eight.
Remember, we're playing to ten.
Next question, in which branch
of the armed services did John
train to be a nurse?
In which branch of the armed
services did John train to be a
nurse?
Paschal, we'll go to you first.
The Army.
That's not right.
Kathy?
Army. Not right.
Neleh?
Army is not right.
V, if you get this right, you
have ten and you win.
Show me your answer.
Air Force is correct.
V wins immunity.
Okay.
You can put your pads down if
you want.
Well, this is obviously a very,
very big vote.
V, as it sits now, you have that
immunity necklace, you can't be
voted for.
But, as always, if you want to
try and parlay that into
something else, help get you
through this game, that's your
option.
Kathy?
 I got an offer.
V, if you keep your immunity and
we formed a vote alliance today
and tomorrow, you'll definitely
get to the final two and if it
results in a tie vote tonight,
I'll take the questions.
 PROBST: I don't know that
we've discussed how a tie-
breaker works.
 Whatever the heat is for the
tie-breaker, I'd take it.
If it doesn't work, I'm out.
 PROBST: Neleh, you had a
comment.
 I'm just thinking about what
they're saying.
Seeing how it's going to work
out.
 PROBST: Do you have a thought
on it?
 No, I'm still figuring it out
real fast.
 PROBST: So let's state it
now.
Kathy's saying keep your
immunity but don't vote for me.
And if you don't vote for me, go
to the final two.
 I can handle that.
If I don't lose my immunity,
I can handle that.
 PROBST: So you two have a
deal.
 Yeah, we've got a deal.
 But I need time to talk to V
about who we're voting for.
 And have it be in front of
us?
 Now my conversation here, I'd
prefer not the jury to hear.
These are conversations that are
on the beach, and the jury
doesn't hear it.
 PROBST: No.
Maybe alliances as you've known
them before.
 Okay.
 But you're making a
deal in a public forum.
 Yeah, no, I understand.
I just want to make sure.
If Neleh stays, Paschal can get
some food.
He is sick of being on the
beach. Paschal and I...
 Wait a second.
Don't talk for me.
Let me say what I'm sick of.
 That's fine.
That's just my opinion.
These are my...
 Don't put me on the chopping
block on your opinion, okay?
 Okay. Well, let's see...
 Well, my vote was going for
Neleh tonight, anyway, so...
 Okay.
 I would say vote off Neleh.
If you don't feel that's
right...
 No, that's fine.
 ...we can vote Paschal then.
 PROBST: Do you guys have a
plan?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Okay.
Thoughts from you guys?
 I mean, you know, Paschal and
I have come this far together
and whether it's me or Paschal,
I don't care.
 PROBST: Kathy?
 I always knew that I was on
the chopping block when I got
down to the final three with
Neleh and Paschal, and it's very
difficult to make the decisions
because they're very tight.
As you can see my voice is even
quivering.
So that's it.
 PROBST: Okay.
It is now time to vote.
Paschal, you first.
 Don't worry.
Simply an amazing woman.
 Kathy, my vote tonight is for
you.
I said I would never, ever vote
against Paschal.
Looks like it's going to be a
tie-breaker, and I'm definitely
not ready to leave.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Neleh.
Kathy.
One vote Neleh, one vote Kathy.
Kathy.
Last vote.
Neleh.
We're tied two votes each.
Okay.
Here's how a tie-breaker works.
Previous votes don't count.
There's no Q & A.
I'm going to give you two
minutes to discuss who should
stay and who should go.
At the end of two minutes, you
need to come to a unanimous
decision as to whether you're
voting out Neleh or Kathy.
If there's no consensus, it will
come down to what's in this bag.
Three rocks in it.
Two rocks are yellow, that's
safe.
One rock is purple and that
means you're out of the game.
The only person who won't have
to reach into this bag tonight
is V.
She has immunity.
So you have two minutes to
decide yourselves or it goes to
chance, which is a lousy way to
leave after 37 days.
 I agree.
 Well, I've played this game
honestly, fairly.
You know, the entire time I've
loved every single minute of
this whole entire game.
If I leave tonight, I'm gonna
leave with a smile and high
head.
 Um, I think I worked hard.
I think I was very honest and it
was just hard to jockey around
your pact, so I think I provided
well and I got food and the
adventure that I just went
through is going to change my
life back at home.
 Neleh, not taking anything
from you, I love your spirit.
 Yeah.
 And I thank goodness that it
was there, but I have to go with
Kathy.
 Paschal?
 You've got to look at the
ultimate goal in this and that's
to stay in at the end.
I think whoever's making the
decision would be foolish to put
Kathy in the finals, because
Kathy is quite capable of
winning any immunity, much more
so than Neleh.
 We can't do unanimous, it's
not going to work.
 So, we have to draw rocks.
 Yep, which is too bad.
 PROBST: Where you guys at?
 Drawing rocks.
 Drawing rocks, to me, seems
like the fairest thing.
 PROBST: It's fair for you
guys.
Paschal, a guy who had no votes
cast tonight, is now vulnerable.
So because together you guys
couldn't make a decision as to
who to vote out, it's now out of
your hands.
You're leaving it up to chance.
Here's what's going to happen.
Neleh, first you'll grab a rock,
then Kathy, then Paschal.
Very important you don't
look at the rock.
When I tell you to, you'll all
three put your hands in the
middle and open it up.
Here I come.
 All right.
 Good luck.
 Good luck, everybody.
 PROBST: Yellow is safe.
Purple means you're going home.
 Well, that feels like purple,
Jeff.
(laughter)
 Oh, God, I'm sure it's mine.
I got ourselves into this gnarly
mess.
 PROBST: Put your hands in
the middle.
Three, two, one, reveal.
 No!
 I told you it felt purple.
 PROBST: Paschal, you need to
bring me your torch.
 Hey, man...
 No, Paschal.
 Congratulations.
 Paschal, Paschal, that's
crazy.
This game's crazy.
 I love you all.
I love you.
(Neleh sobbing)
 I love you.
 See you.
 PROBST: Paschal, it has been
a one-of-a-kind Tribal Council,
but the tribe has spoken.
 Been great, thanks a lot.
Thank you. Thank all of you.
I appreciate it.
 I love you, Paschal.
 PROBST: Well, one way or
another, you three women have
made it to the final three.
You have a long journey ahead of
you tomorrow.
You can head back to camp.
 It's been an amazing
experience.
I've met some wonderful people
and made some life-long friends.
And to the competitors that
remain, I wish each of them
luck.
They're all worthy.
And to the other jury members, I
look forward to being part of
you.
 PROBST: Hey, guys.
Wake up.
 Hey, Jeff.
 PROBST: Good morning.
It's day 38, and you have a very
long day ahead of you.
 What's the plan, dude?
 PROBST: I'm just going to lay
out the day for you.
 What time is it?
 PROBST: It's early.
Very early.
All right, guys. Day 38.
Time to prepare for your last
immunity challenge.
It begins with assembling this
outrigger canoe.
One last chance to work together
before you compete together for
one last time.
Once you have it built, paddle
out into the South Pacific over
to Hakititi Beach, where you
will celebrate a native
tradition by tattooing yourself
Marquesan style, and then you'll
pay tribute to your former tribe
mates.
Finally, you will cleanse
yourself with a Marquesan
purification bath, before
meeting me at the final part of
your immunity challenge.
All right?
Here's a map with your journey.
I suggest you build a fire.
It's a long day, and you'll be
leaving here in an hour.
 So, where's the
Soliantu camp?
Where's Challenge Beach?
 This is challenge immunity
right there.
 Right there.
Anything else that it says?
I'm blind as a bat.
 It just says "mountain
range."
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 First we have to disassemble
a raft?
 No, we have to assemble an
outrigger.
 Putting the outrigger canoe
together was quite easy.
Myself and Kathy are pretty good
knot-tyers.
 Go around this way to tighten
it up once.
 We kind of like just stepped
up, put that rigger canoe
together, like the chicks that
we are, and Neleh went ahead and
prepared the water, got the
canteens ready.
 The key is, does that go to
the stern or the bow?
Okay, I got it.
This will go over the canoe like
this.
 Yup.
 Yep, perfect.
 So, three women working
together, those heads worked
pretty dang good together, I
should say so.
 Take it slow.
 I can't find the words yet,
what it's like to be on that
beach for that long.
 Okay, girls, you ready?
 Paddling away from it, and we
knew something was ahead of us
that was going to be probably
challenging but also really
good.
It felt great.
It was exhilarating, it was fun,
it was a sense of release and
power.
 Guys, as we're going, I'm
going to say a prayer.
Father God, in the name of Jesus
I thank you for...
(indistinct shouting)
 All right.
 All right, woman.
 It's so exciting.
 You guys, this is so neat.
Seriously, what an experience.
You know?
 Yep.
 You guys, this looks like it
right here.
 This is so cool!
 We'll all do fun stuff on
each other.
 Whoo!
 I don't want to talk now,
because I don't want to...
I'm just...
 I know.
 ...reflecting on
everything.
 I am.
 I am, too.
I am reflecting, totally.
 Oh, I love this.
Seriously, every step I go along
I just love it more and more
and it means more and more to
me, you know?
My tattoos mean a ton of stuff.
is mainly, like, my family,
because they're by far the most
important thing in this
entire world to me.
My leg, of course, this is my
original Rotu tribe that I
started out with, and I put
"love" just because I
seriously love every single
person that I've met out here
and I love the experience that
I've been able to have.
(laughter)
 When I think of some of the
people, if they were here
watching me, they'd think I'm
insane because they wouldn't get
it.
 They're going to love it.
 But they still wouldn't get
it.
Like, have you lost your
marbles?
 No, that was yesterday,
Kathy.
 I lost my marbles yesterday?
 I have 16 tribes members on
my leg dancing.
A waterfall, because it gave me
so much strength during the hard
times.
The sun showering down upon us
into a little love fest.
 Does that look right?
Vision?
Did I spell "vision" right?
 I can't see. (chuckles)
 I saw tattooing as an
opportunity for me to reflect
personally on my own odyssey.
This is supposed to be 16
people representing fire.
Each one has the person's name
and the number in which they
have been voted off.
Peter one, Patricia two,
Hunter...
It stops at number 13, which was
Paschal English.
It was so funny because the Rotu
people asked me if there was
anybody I would like to be in
the finals with who would it be
and I said with Kathy, you know.
We both have a 50-50 shot, I'd
say.
 Yeah.
 But as far as deserving of
it...
 Yeah, yeah...
 ...to be up there...
 Yeah.
 ...definitely Kathy.
 You haven't won yet.
 Thank you.
 Huh?
 You guys haven't won yet.
 What do you mean?
 Oh, no, we were just in
theory.
 Yeah...
 Just in theory.
 Right now, I mean, there's a
lot of arrogance in the air, you
know, between V and Kathy.
It's been kind of annoying today
to tell you the truth, sitting
over there on the mat finishing
up my tattooing and hearing, you
know, her tell Kathy "Oh, if I
would have, you know, had to
make it to the two I definitely
knew it was going to be you" and
all this drama.
It's like throwing it in your
face which I don't think is very
good sportsmanship.
 (sobbing): I love you.
 I don't think we're there
yet.
You guys okay back there?
 Uh-huh.
 Yep.
 We got off the ridge and we
hiked to an area of
purification.
 Oh, wow.
 This is wild.
 Apparently, the Marquesans do
some type of baptismal ritual
with manui oils, ginger, and
God knows what else.
 God, it smells good.
 You guys, we need to say a
prayer over this.
 Yes, we do.
 So being that this was really
the last rites, in a way, of us
being here, we took a moment of
prayer to recall our journey
from the beginning of the day.
 We're so grateful for the
strength to get this far and
for all the energy that we've
had.
 Yes, yes...
 We're so grateful for this
time that we have to be together
and please watch over and
protect us the rest of the day,
that we may be so grateful for
all we have and I say these
things in the name of Jesus
Christ, Amen.
 Amen.
 Talk to me, I didn't know it
was going to be yellow.
(screaming)
 Come on, Neleh!
(screaming continues)
Are you going to pour it, babe?
Do it.
 It's just amazing that a meek
21-year-old, a very, very deep-
thinking religious individual
and then a businessperson like
myself...
That feels pretty good.
...here on the final three we
are, the three... the three...
I don't know if it's chicks.
I don't think that's the right
word, but I find it amazing.
 Gosh, this is neat, you guys.
 It is cool.
 Yeah.
 V, can I tell you how tribal
you look?
 Do I look tribal?
 Yeah.
 V, do you want some flowers
in your hair?
You'll be beautiful.
 As we were finishing up the
purification, we knew that we
would have to change modes from
enjoyment and remembrance to...
challenge and compete.
We knew that the next step
would be the last for somebody,
and the enjoyment of the day was
over with.
 Are we ready?
 Let's get our hands in here.
 One, two, three, Soliantu!
 Soliantu!
 Kathy and V made that pact
last night saying, you know, if
one of us wins immunity we're
bringing each other to the top
together.
I have to fight for my life, you
know.
I want the million dollars more
than anything out here.
And so I'm not going to go down
without giving it definitely my
best shot.
 PROBST: Well, the game is
back on now.
You're about to begin your final
immunity challenge.
It's very simple.
It is a test of endurance.
You'll each take a position
around the idol.
You'll step up on to two logs,
one foot on each log.
You'll then take one hand--
either one-- and place it on the
idol.
Those are your three points of
contact.
If at any time any of those
points of contact are broken,
you're out.
Feet have to stay touching the
log.
Hand has to stay touching the
idol.
Additionally, if your other hand
comes in and grabs on to the
idol or the tiki to gain your
balance, you're also out.
Last person standing wins
immunity, guaranteed to go to
the final two and, as
importantly, gets to decide who
sits next to them for the final
vote.
So before we begin, I will take
that one last time.
 Here you go.
 PROBST: Boy, you even smell
good.
That's a first.
(laughter)
Sorry.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad
news.
Guys, for the last time,
immunity back up for grabs.
All right, guys, the final and
most important immunity
challenge.
Survivors ready?
Begin.
This one comes down to will.
You want immunity bad enough,
hang on to that thing.
It should be a nice hot day,
too.
The sun's starting to peek
through the clouds.
 I knew Jeff would be here
bugging us.
 PROBST: I'm just setting the
stage for you.
 That's good.
 PROBST: I'm happy to inform
you, you've just reached an hour
and a half.
 Whoo!
 PROBST: On a day that started
at about 3:00 a.m.
 I have to win this, otherwise
I'm out.
 PROBST: Do you think that
deal is going to hold strong
between these two?
 Yup.
 PROBST: If Neleh is the first
one out, V, do you and Kathy
just end this, 'cause you've
already got a deal?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Have you thought
about who you'd take with you?
You've already made your
decision?
 Uh...
Yeah, I think I've got that
one down.
 PROBST: So Kathy, you pretty
much feel like you're fighting
for your life?
 Yep. Neleh is mad at me.
 Oh, I'm not mad at you,
Kathy!
 Yes, you are.
 Why would I be mad at you?
 I don't know.
 I swear on my life, I'm not
mad at you.
 Well, not mad.
 We've come this far together.
 I know.
 We love each other.
It's a game.
 I love you, too.
 It's a game.
 PROBST: Guys, you've reached
three hours.
 All right!
 Whoo!
 Whoo!
 PROBST: How are you feeling?
 I'm good.
 Oh, feeling pretty good.
 PROBST: I'm going to start
updating you guys a little more
frequently now.
You're now at three and a half
hours.
Four hours, guys.
Four hours.
 Good job, girls. Way to go.
 Stay in there, baby.
 Watch your blouse.
 Oh!
 Showing every...
 Oh...
 Showing the jewels.
 PROBST: Don't-Don't walk next
to Neleh.
 Neleh.
 What?
 I'll give you immunity, I'll
drop off, if you keep me in
with you, okay?
 PROBST: What are you guys
saying?
 I told her if I drop off now
and she gets immunity, will she
guarantee to take me in the
finals with her.
 'Cause I could stay up here
all night. I'm not even tired.
 I could stay up here all
night, too.
 Yeah.
 I'm not tired either.
 Do you want to do it?
 We might as well, I mean,
Kathy already went out.
 I'm fine with that.
Yeah!
(squeals)
 PROBST: Well earned.
You're safe, and it sounds like
there's a new deal in place.
I will see you at Tribal Council
shortly.
 All right.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
our jury.
As you can see, one member of
the jury, the newest jury member
Paschal, is not here.
You guys have been through a lot
in 38 days, not going to hide
anything from you now.
Just before Tribal Council was
to begin, Paschal collapsed.
He's been evacuated to medical
care.
He's in excellent hands, and,
luckily for us, one of your own
tribe members is also a
registered nurse.
John was there, and if you
wouldn't mind, this is your
tribe.
Would you just put their minds
at ease and tell them what
happened with Paschal?
 Shortly before we came here
he basically just kind of
fainted on his feet, and he's
just showing signs of
dehydration.
Everything looked real good.
He's within normal limits.
He was talking, he was alert, he
knew where he was.
So we said a prayer, and he's
going to be okay.
Okay? Okay.
 I'm just glad he's okay.
 Yeah. I'm glad he's okay,
too.
 PROBST: We have a Tribal
Council to deal with.
If you guys are okay to go
ahead?
Long day.
Highs and lows for everybody.
We get to an immunity challenge
where it really is about
willpower, ultimately.
You guys wanted it.
You hung on for a long time, and
then what happens?
 I just lost my concentration.
I looked down and I was
correcting my shirt and I fell
off.
So it was totally concentration.
It was my own fault.
So it's not a big deal.
I, you know, I was getting tired
anyway, I was going to give it
one more hour and then I had
to... I had to cash out.
 Yeah, and it was totally... I
just did not want herself
exposed.
 Yeah.
 It wasn't anything trying to
lure her off or anything.
 No, no, not at all, so...
 PROBST: You fell off the
stump.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Before you know it,
V's made a deal with Neleh, like
that.
 I know.
I was disappointed, because I
thought we had a little thing
going on, but you know what?
What goes around comes around.
I negotiated a deal yesterday,
she negotiated a deal today.
It seems like that's what's
happening with the game.
We're doing deals every five
hours.
So, I was disappointed.
I thought we were going to ride
it but, you know what, c'est la
vie, what can you do?
 PROBST: Vecepia, what was
your obligation to Kathy at that
point?
 To be honest, um, when I
think about what we discussed
yesterday, I don't recall
anything about me trying to
carry her.
 Hmm...
 When she told me that she was
having cramps I said, "Well, how
much longer can you last?"
But then all of a sudden she
fell, and then at that point I
was, like, "Okay, so am I... am
I carrying her?
Is that part of our agreement?
I'm not sure."
 Well, I thought we did.
I actually thought we did.
 And I said at that time, the
best thing to do... I mean, I
could have stayed up there for
another three hours.
I was okay, but I said, you
know, the best thing to do right
now, we can stop this charade.
I can just ask "Neleh, hey, you
want to end it?
I'll give you the immunity if
you give me the spot."
And so I did that.
 PROBST: Neleh, were you going
to outlast V?
 You know, I was not going to
go down today without a fight.
I've been on the chopping board
for two days now.
All day long I have known that
if I didn't win this immunity
tonight, that I was going to be
the one that was leaving
tonight.
And I wasn't about to give up.
And so, you know, when it was
offered to me, definitely, you
know, I took it.
 PROBST: Let me ask you a
question.
Both you and V have been very
open and very vocal about your
beliefs, spiritual beliefs,
religious beliefs.
Kathy, faith play any part for
you out here?
 Yeah.
I was on those logs, and I was
praying just to get through it,
just to get through it.
And there were a lot of other
deep thoughts that were going
through my mind to keep me
going.
 PROBST: Like what?
 Oh, you know, let's see.
I hung by my dad's bedside for
five hours while he died and I
said, "If I can do that," and he
would want me to hang in on
those logs.
I really focused on that for
quite some time.
In addition to saying the Lord's
Prayer and also just... just
talking to my father.
It was pretty cool, because I
haven't been doing that.
 PROBST: Nice feeling, it
looks like.
 It was great.
I haven't talked to him in
years.
I guess I just had to go deep.
 PROBST: Well, a big vote.
Kathy, V, you can't vote for
Neleh.
You can't vote for yourselves,
so therefore you can only vote
for each other, so you cancel
each other out.
You won't vote.
Neleh will be the only person
casting a vote.
Interesting thing is, within the
last two Tribal Councils, each
one of you at different times
has either changed your mind,
offered to change your mind, or
considered changing your mind
about who you were going to vote
for.
The question now is, will Neleh
change her mind?
It is time to vote.
Neleh, you're up.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
vote.
Once the vote is read, the
decision is final.
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the vote.
The 14th person voted out of the
tribe...
Kathy.
 Good luck, you guys.
(sighs)
 PROBST: Kathy, the tribe has
spoken.
 All right, Jeff.
Thank you.
See you guys.
 PROBST: So long.
Here's where we're at.
You two have done what 14 others
failed to do.
You've gone as far as you can go
in this game on your own power.
This game now shifts from you to
the seven members of the jury.
Seven people who you had a hand
in voting out will now have a
hand in deciding which one of
you two wins this thing.
You have one night left, one day
tomorrow.
Drink it in.
There's nothing left to do.
Take your torches, head back to
camp.
I'll most definitely see you
tomorrow.
 16 total American strangers
hit this island.
First thing off the bat, we're
working as a team.
It was done with positive
attitudes, integrity...
Honesty, uh, it might have been
a little shaky at times.
It's the relationships and how
you can improve upon them that
I'm taking away.
But, uh, I loved it.
 Oh! I can't believe it.
 What?
 We're here.
I can't believe I'm here.
It'll catch any second.
Yeah.
 There we go.
 All right.
You know what? When V said I'll
give you immunity and then you
take me to the final two with
you, I was planning on bringing
V to the final two with me
anyways, and so it was like no
big deal.
I know I'd have a better
shot against V in the final two
than I would Kathy.
And whatever deal her and Kathy
made was between her because I
was not a part of that.
And I felt good about it.
 All right.
 Oh, my heck, we got a fire,
girl.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Last night together on this
island.
 The reason why I offered
Neleh the immunity was for
several reasons.
I took the risk because once
Kathy slipped, I knew that her
and I would probably be battling
for a long time.
 Oh!
 Girl, you and I.
 Had to sit on the tiki thing
for four hours.
 You and I.
$100,000, $1 million.
 Oh, my gosh.
 I was just assuming to make
it to the final two with Kathy,
because I know Kathy had some
situations with some people in
her old tribe, but then when I
turn it around, I also know that
there are a lot of people that
felt that Neleh has been riding
coattails and that she's not
deserving of being in the
position that she's in.
And looking at both scenarios, I
knew that my best shot was to
make it to the final two with
Neleh.
I wish you the best, sweetie.
 I wish you the best, too.
 I really do.
In every game, sometimes you
have to make a move that you
really don't want to.
But in order to keep the upper
hand, you may have to.
I myself, I think that's okay.
I've asked the Lord for
forgiveness.
So, being a Christian, we know
we have that ability to go to
our father and say, "Lord, this
is what I did.
I know you saw this.
Please forgive me and I will go
to my brother and ask him--
after it's over with-- and ask
him for forgiveness, as well."
Oh, let's say a pray for
Pappy real quick.
 Oh, yes.
Our heavenly Father we are so
grateful for this wonderful day
and the opportunity that we've
had.
As this night comes to a close,
Heavenly Father, we ask that
Thou would please watch over and
protect our loved ones,
especially Pappy at this time,
as he is in the hospital, that
he may be able to get the
strength and encouragement that
he needs so that he may be
good and strong.
If it be Thy will, that he
may be able to come to Council
tomorrow.
 Amen.
 Thank you.
Okay, I'll see you later.
 Night, sweetie.
 Okay, have a good sleep.
 I shall.
How are you this morning?
 Good. How are you?
 Wonderful.
 We're going to take a mud
bath in the waterfall.
 Cool.
Go get us some apples and taro,
get some porridge.
 Oh, look at that huge pig.
Look at that.
We were just amazed that that
cute little pig gravitated
closer and closer to the
homestead.
Then we noticed a couple feet
from him, two or three chickens.
We weren't even thinking about
trying to run after them and try
catch them.
It was good to see the pig for
the last time, it was great to
see the chickens for the last
time.
And it was great to get up and
cook popcorn for the last time.
 Mm-mm-mm.
 The popcorn of the Marquesas.
 I mean, I'm going to miss
this place.
I'm going to miss the beach and
the sand.
You know, I am going to miss the
people that I, you know, became
really close to out here.
Last mud bath together.
This place is beautiful, but
being out here for 39 days, I'm
definitely ready to leave it all
behind.
Want to burn some stuff with me?
 Whose clothes are those?
 Oh, John's, Patricia's,
Pap's.
You know, just start up a little
bonfire and burn people's
clothes that they didn't want
anymore.
It just felt good and helped to
pass the time.
I'm not returning to this beach
tonight because everything is
going to be burned up.
Here go Pappy's pants that he
hated.
Going to Tribal Council tonight,
it's a huge thing.
The power is no longer within
us, you know, to be able to vote
each other off.
The power is totally in the
jury.
They are the ones that are going
to make the ultimate decision
tonight in who wins a million
dollars.
 Like Christ said when he was
hanging on the cross, "It is
finished."
It is almost done.
I hope that the jury will look
at the way I played this game as
very strategic, extremely
deciseful, in some parts
deceiving, but when you look at
some of the deceptive parts,
they have put me in line to get
to where I am, and it was a
great strategy.
 I've been thinking about this
all day, you know, who is going
to vote for me tonight.
And all I can do is just say
what I, you know, feel.
I really feel like I have great
relationships with everybody.
I hope they'll look at me and
know that I've been up-front and
honest, and hopefully that will
work towards my advantage.
 This may be the last time
we'll be able to just look out
and see the ocean like this from
this view.
We both are ultimate survivors,
girl.
 Yeah, you know it.
Here we are.
 That's right.
 We totally made it.
I owe it all to the Lord and my
family and everybody that's just
kept me so strong out here.
(laughing)
 I think this game was played
differently.
I think it was played honestly.
I don't know what caused two
Christian women to end up where
they are.
It could be faith.
It could be a lot of things.
I think it was probably as much
a camaraderie in a game as I've
ever noticed.
An awful lot of it is luck.
It's hard to make an argument
that both of them didn't play
the game very well, because both
of them are right there at the
end.
 Good-bye, stream.
Good-bye, coconuts.
 Last night I woke up and I
felt I was in the jungle.
I looked at the wall and the
banyan trees and the vines
were there.
And I turned on the light and
they were gone.
I am definitely detoxing, and
it's freaking me out.
So when it comes to talking
about the vote right now, I
can't even process the game
right now, except for the fact
that I lost and I haven't
focused on who I'm going to vote
at the moment.
 Bye, chickens and crabs.
 To have an all-women's final
is the best.
Girls kick ass and I'm glad to
see it.
We had some strong men on the
team, but you know what?
I'd say the women kind of ruled
the roost.
I think V and Neleh are both
well-deserved of the money.
They both did a hell of a job.
It is going to be a tough call
tonight for me.
 Well, I can't tell you that I
feel good about seeing the two
women that are left in there,
and knowing that they got past
me, that they actually beat me.
But I'm one of seven who have
the power now.
So I'm going to make a
decision who goes home $900,000
richer.
That's kind of a little bit of a
coup for myself.
 I hate when you're African-
American and you talk about
race, people say this race card.
Whoever wins this million is not
going to be swayed by my
preference for race.
Because we are in a game and I
am a competitor, I think the
best person who played a good
game should win.
V has switched alliances on me.
If I feel like she is being
dishonest or if I feel like her
integrity is questionable, Neleh
may very well get my vote.
 There is a huge feeling of
power being on the jury.
And I didn't realize that until
I became one of the jury members
and had to accept the fact that
I was out of the game and I was
now on the jury.
I don't think I want either of
the two people that are left to
have the million dollars.
So I have a huge decision now.
Basically, I have to figure out
which one of them I think played
the game the best and which one
screwed me over less in the
game.
 I don't know what to do.
You got these Bible thumpers up
there, and you know, just
banging either The Book of
Mormon or banging their Bibles
and lying out of the sides of
their mouths, and now I have to
search within myself to figure
out which one of these creeps I
want to give a million dollars
to.
I really want to go in and say,
"Okay, the slate is clean.
Your reaction to my statement
will determine whether or not
you get my vote.
If you answer honestly, you're
repentant, then I will say okay.
If you start lying right off the
bat-- pfft!-- you're going to
lose my vote."
The power now is shifting back
to the two of them.
And I'm saying, "Let's see what
you're going to do with it."
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
our jury.
As you can see, tonight we have
our full jury of seven,
including Kathy who was voted
out at the last Tribal Council.
And Paschal is back, who was
unable to make the last
Tribal Council.
He has been in very good hands
throughout the night and day.
He's been fully informed about
the last Tribal Council, he's
completely up to date and ready
for tonight.
Okay, before we get to the main
event, I want to find out how
you guys spent your last day,
the 39th day.
Neleh, how was the day for you?
 The day today has just been
awesome.
You know, I slept in as long as
I could, just because I knew the
day was going to go by so slow.
I pretty much just kind of
rested for about two or three
hours, I couldn't really sleep.
It was more just kind of like in
a daze, just, you know, thinking
about the last 39 days out here
and just the people I've met and
just all the different
encounters that I've had.
And then after that, I just got
this really big spurt of energy
just out of nowhere and I just
got up and just started burning
everything.
 Burning everything.
 I pretty much just went to
town.
I was a pyro today, you know,
putting soot and stuff on my
face, just burning everything
that I could, so it was a nice
day.
 PROBST: Okay, you two have
come as far as you can.
The focus now shifts to the
seven members of the jury.
It is one of the most unique
aspects of this game.
Seven people that you had a hand
in voting out now get to decide
your fate.
You start this game with a clean
slate and over 39 days, you
build a history.
Tonight that history is going to
be evaluated and ultimately
judged.
Your behavior, good or bad, as
well as how you respond to
tonight's Tribal Council, will
have a big impact on the final
vote.
Here's how it will work.
We'll begin with an opening
statement by each of you-- a
chance to address the jury and
explain why you think you're the
most deserving person of the
title Survivor and a million
dollars.
Then the jury gets a chance to
address you.
They can make a comment, they
can ask a question.
You'll then get a chance to make
a closing statement addressing
some of the things that have
come up.
Then we go to the vote.
How you respond to these
questions is very important.
It's time to begin.
Neleh, opening statement to the
jury.
 Okay. Well, what I just want
to say to you guys is I've had
the most incredible time out
here.
You know, the last 39 days, I
honestly when I first came to
this island, I was like, oh, my
heck, I don't have a chance to
be in the final end.
I mean, just that I was up
against such competitors and
such strong-willed people.
And there were times where
literally you guys were just
pulling me through the entire
time.
I wasn't the strongest person
but spiritually and mentally, I
just tried to provide, you know,
upliftment and you know, just
everything that I did for you
guys, I want you to know that I
did sincerely out of the love of
my heart.
Just overall, I seriously want
you to know that I have given
everything 100% out here, and I
just love you guys
unconditionally, no matter what
your vote is tonight.
I want you to know that
sincerely, from the bottom of my
heart.
 PROBST: V, why do you deserve
to win this?
 Well, guys, this has been a
wonderful ride for me.
The vision was brought to me
about four months ago.
And just like the Scripture
says, that I write my vision
down and I make it plain on
tablets and that I kept it
before me each and every day.
From the day I came out here, I
made several things clear that I
wanted to do.
The first thing, I wanted to
have a strategy, and I saw that
strategy all the way to its
completion.
The second thing was I promised
myself that I would develop
relationships with every single
person, and I value each and
every one of you.
And the third thing was that
when I came in here, I didn't
want to come in here and ride
anybody's coattail.
I wanted to prove myself with my
work ethics, with my
spirituality, and with my... my
gumption to come out here and
be the ultimate survivor.
And I feel that I
contributed wholeheartedly 100%
to everything I did, even when
people called me deceiving.
I still were friends to all of
you, and I hope that you
remember that.
But I put my faith in God
knowing that you guys will all
look at this objectively.
That's, that's all.
And that's all I have to say.
And, um... God bless you all.
 PROBST: Okay, jury.
I want you guys to take some
time to think about what Neleh
and V just said, because in a
moment, you are going to ask
each of them a question that
will help you decide who will be
the sole Survivor.
 PROBST: There's now a chance
for the jury to address Neleh
and V.
You guys have a very big vote to
make tonight.
This is a chance-- one last
chance-- to elicit a little more
information, before you vote for
the person who will win a
million dollars and the title of
sole Survivor.
You can ask a question or make a
statement.
We'll begin with Tammy.
 I have always been up-front
about the way that I was going
to play this game.
Said all along that I was going
to lie, I was going to cheat.
I was going to do whatever it
took to win this game.
But sometime during the game,
my strategy changed.
I started feeling bad about the
way I was playing the game and
it was because of you two and
your holier than thou attitude,
and "I'm not going to lie, I'm
not going to cheat, let's take
this game to a new level, let's
play it with ethics, and morals
and integrity."
Well, you guys are hypocrites,
as far as I'm concerned.
And you may have been the two
biggest liars out on the island.
While you're condemning Rob and
John and Zoe and myself for
manipulating and being
deceptive, you guys were doing
the exact same thing behind our
backs, but under the guise of
Christianity and "we're not
going to lie."
V, you flip-flopped so many
times in this game, I don't even
think you knew which team you
were playing on half the time.
But you always made yourself
feel better, because after you
lied to somebody, you always
went up and asked for their
forgiveness.
And then you asked God to
forgive you for lying.
Neleh, you started this game out
as a 21-year-old Mormon woman
who seemed to have a lot of
self-respect.
The one thing that you said you
wanted from the beginning was to
make it to the jury.
So Rob, John, Zoe and myself
offered you a chance to make it
to the jury.
That sounded good to you, until
you got greedy and decided that
being on the jury wasn't good
enough.
So you lied to us, you stabbed
us in the back and you voted us
off.
This is the thing.
I don't think either one of you
deserve the million dollars.
I think the person that deserves
the million dollars is the woman
that you voted out yesterday,
right after you stabbed her in
the back, V.
But this is a game, and you guys
beat me at my own game.
You lied better than I did.
You manipulated better than I
did, and you deceived everybody
better than I did.
So congratulations.
 PROBST: Sean.
 (laughs)
Oh, man...
First of all, I want to say
congratulations, ladies.
I didn't come up here to playa
hate on either one of y'all.
Both of y'all deserve this,
'cause you out-played, out-
witted all of us.
It is really tough, because, you
know, it is easy for people to
pick on religion.
I don't like that, when people
pick on people with religion and
say you're contradictory.
'Cause people do it all the time
and people get funny about
religion, you don't want to
throw it in people's face.
As I sit and look at you two
guys, I want you to directly
answer my question.
Is there... some kind of moral
message that you feel like
you've gained from this game?
 Morally, there were times in
the game where I wanted to
follow my heart, but because of
the strong alliance that I had
made, I felt like I couldn't do
that, and that is one thing
morally that I've learned, is to
follow my heart from now on.
 PROBST: V.
 And I would fall in line with
the same thing.
The lesson is that when I'm in a
situation, I will really think
it through before I give my word
on something.
Because sometimes I acted very
quickly on making decisions and
I would just give somebody the
answer just to appease them.
So now, instead of just quickly
giving people answers, I will
take the time to really think it
through and tell them, you know,
either, "I'll get back with you"
so that I know I'm not battling
with my morals as opposed to
giving somebody my word.
 That's it.
 PROBST: Thanks.
Paschal.
 Well, I haven't really
prepared anything.
I was more concerned about being
here.
Uh, both of you ladies are
completely deserving, in my
opinion, of being the ultimate
Survivor.
You are both the epitome of what
this great country of ours has
to offer.
I am so proud of both of you.
I would love to have had either
one of you as my daughters.
You're those types of
individuals.
And through it all, you have
given me the strength to get to
the point that I got through,
and realize that, from this day
forward, I'm going to be a
better person for having met
y'all and having y'all as part
of my life and all these other
individuals, too.
So whatever happens tonight, I
wish it could be a joint win for
both of you, because I really
think you're both so deserving,
both so incredible, so
refreshing.
Ya'll are incredible
individuals.
And I wish both of you the best
of luck, and I look forward to
having you in my life forever.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Paschal.
General.
 I have one question for both
of you's, and I'm seeking direct
answers.
I always believed that you
should never regret any decision
you make or any action you take.
But during the course of this
game, what specific decision you
have made or action you have
taken do you believe can most
adversely hurt you tonight?
 PROBST: V?
 I believe that, number one, I
do not regret anything that I
did in this game.
 I'm looking for specifics.
Just one specific thing.
I don't want an explanation.
 What I did yesterday to
Kathy.
 Thank you.
 With me, the main thing I
regret, I guess, is having you
and Zoe go when it got down to
us four, rather than me and Sean
in the end.
But because of the alliance that
I made with the five of them, I
felt like I needed to stick to
that, but that is the main thing
I regret.
 No explanation.
 Okay.
 Just specific.
 PROBST: Thanks, General.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Zoe.
 (sighs)
Well, I have a work hard,
play hard attitude.
And I feel like I should be
sitting up there in that seat.
I feel I worked really hard out
there.
I played hard with the people
who wanted to play, but I'm not
going to talk about lies and
deception because I was there,
too.
We all were there.
Basically, I believe both of you
have good hearts, and you made
it... to the spot that all
of us wanted to be at.
And congratulations there, and
that's all I have to say.
 PROBST: Thanks, Zoe.
Kathy.
 Um, I just have two
questions, and first question is
for Neleh.
I was just curious, at what
point in the game do you feel
that you did your most dramatic
strategic movement, and what the
decision was and when and the
decision that you made by
yourself.
 The time in the game where
actually I started playing the
game was day 24.
You know, Paschal and I
both talked about this together.
It was one of those things
where, you know, Sean had
approached us earlier saying the
four of them are in an alliance,
you know, we can switch this
game around at this point.
Up until that time, I mean, I
was seriously 100% going with
Rotu and just hoping that in the
end, out of the six of us, maybe
something would change, because,
you know, there was the four of
them and the two of us.
But when it got down to the
nitty gritty, that is when, you
know, we made the biggest
strategic move.
And that was the five of us
against the four of them.
And that, it's... you know, I've
been saying that all along.
That's when I started playing
the game was day 24.
 And then V, um, one time you
did tell me your strategy and
the strategy was that you were
going to wait to be approached
by people for alliances,
strategy, that you were never
going to set forth and do it on
your own.
The question is, how can you go
through the game, you know,
adjusting with all these
alliances and not feel part of
the devious behavior?
That was my question.
 My strategy, yes, was for me
to wait for people to approach
me.
Now if I felt that there was a
strategic move being worked that
I can weasel my way in there, I
would take the initiative and
ask.
Everyone is constantly changing
their game plan, and you're out
here to outwit, outplay,
outlast.
Outwit may be, immediately I
need to make a change.
So, that's what it was.
It's like when you wanted to
line up with me and said don't
oust me, you weren't even a
person I was going to even get
rid of.
I had Neleh in mind.
 That's okay. You...
 So, I mean, you know, you
made the decision...
 You're not answering my
question.
 ...for me to ally with you,
and I just said well, that's
fine. I hope I...
Did I answer your question?
 No, but that's okay.
 PROBST: Thank you.
John.
 I just want straight-up talk.
Okay? Straight-up.
 Okay.
 You know how I feel.
I threw out the honesty card.
I played it, I lost.
It's important to me.
Integrity is important to me.
You both lied, okay?
Cut to the chase, you're not
innocent, you're not naive.
You both did it, so take a deep
breath and clear it.
Everybody knows it.
So I want to know now, right
now, why the hell should I give
you my vote?
Plain and simple, and knowing
me, John-- Johnny Pots and
Pans-- you knew me for 24
days, you know who I am.
Why should I give you my vote?
 PROBST: Neleh.
 Uh, why you should give me
your vote?
Goll, that... sucks.
Um... the reason why you should
give me your vote, John, is
because truly, honestly, I was
going to join your guys'
foursome alliance, honestly
hoping that in the end something
would change around and I would
be able to be more than fifth
place.
As soon as I found out that was
not going to happen, that is
when I decided to not do that
anymore, and that's my answer.
Is that what you're looking for?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Vecepia?
 The reason why I think that
you should give me the million
dollars, number one is, you
knew I came in here with a
strategy.
Number two, coming in here with
a strategy, playing the game all
the way to the hilt-- whether it
deceived you or deceived anybody
else-- I played the game to the
fullest to get me to where I am.
Did I answer your question?
 Yes, you did.
 PROBST: Thanks.
Well, there's been a lot
of questions and talk about
worthiness and justifying your
behavior while condemning the
same behavior in others.
You'll have a chance to address
that in your final comments to
the jury.
Take a moment, think about what
you want to say.
 PROBST: Okay, you've heard
the jury's comments, had a
chance to think about what they
had to say.
Now this is your chance to
respond.
It is time for your final
comment, V.
 I really only have one thing
that I do want to address, and
by the way, you guys blew me
away with a lot of your
questions.
I felt that some people just
made comments, and I wanted to
have questions so that you guys
will have a strong base to go
by-- not just simple
innuendoes-- but a very strong
base because this is a lot of
money at stake.
But just make sure that whatever
responses the two of us gave
you, that you really find what
you need to make a conscious
decision, each and every one of
you.
That's all I have to say.
 PROBST: Neleh, your final
address to the jury.
 When you guys go to vote, I
just want you guys to consider
just the way that I treated you
guys.
Just my love for you guys, my
compassion for you guys.
And I honestly, truly feel that
everybody here would deserve a
million dollars.
I think it's luck that I'm up
here right now.
I want you guys to know, towards
the end, day 24, I did start
having to play the game.
I didn't feel like I needed to
up until that point.
And so everything that happened
before that was truly, truly
just honestly the way that I
felt for you guys.
That's all.
 PROBST: Okay.
So we come to the vote.
Tonight's vote is a little
different.
Tonight you are not voting
somebody out of the tribe.
The name of the person you write
down on the parchment is the
person you think most deserving
of the title of Survivor and a
million dollars.
You are voting for a winner.
It's time to vote.
John, you're first.
 (sighs) This was an
unbelievably hard decision.
I hoped Neleh would really come
forward and tell me, "Sorry, I
betrayed you, I lied to you."
That didn't happen.
V, you came in the backdoor.
You flew under the radar.
It's not my style, but you
played the game, and I
appreciate you answering your
questions honestly.
And, uh, you go, girl.
 More honest, less deceitful,
and always completed the race
whether she was first or last.
Very deserving.
 Yo, we did it, baby.
Even though it was a tough road,
better you than me, sweetie.
You deserve this.
I know you're gonna represent.
It ain't even about a million
dollars.
But if you do happen to win one
million dollars...
hook a brother up, you know?
Help me pay my rent, you know.
Hook it up so that we can do
this right.
But all the love to you, sister.
After it's all said and done, we
are definitely going to do some
chicken and waffles.
We'll hook it up, but...
God is good, remember that.
Whatever the outcome is, you
know, put Christ first and it's
all gonna fall into place.
So, I love you, sister, keep
your head up and good luck.
 Going to make this short and
sweet.
"V" is not for victory tonight.
Neleh is the Survivor here.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
 PROBST: Okay.
I know it's been a long 39 days,
and I'm certain you would like
to see this settled tonight.
Unfortunately, it's going to
have to wait until we get back
to the United States.
Good night.
(helicopter blades whirring)
(whistling)
Central Park.
(cheers and applause)
(tribal music playing)
There you go, man.
Can I get a receipt?
Hi!
 PROBST: Well, we have... we
have traveled from literally the
most remote island in the world,
to, without doubt, the greatest
island in the world, Manhattan!
(cheers and applause)
I can't think of a better place
for this final vote to play out
than right here in Central Park
in New York City.
I have the votes.
We're going to get to them.
But first, it's been five months
since we finished this.
Five months since these votes
were cast.
Nothing you two are going to say
tonight is going to change these
votes.
Outcome already determined.
Just not yet revealed.
So with that in mind, as you
guys watched this play out over
the last 13 weeks on television,
I'm imagining a lot of what you
heard or said was said about
you, you're hearing for the
first time because you are not
always privy to the interviews
or what happens behind your back
or at the other camp.
So my question, Vecepia, I'll
start with you, is did you hear
anything when you watched it at
home when you said "Wow, that
surprises me that people would
say that about me or think that
about me"?
 I was surprised about, one of
the biggest things is
perception.
Perception regarding myself and
Sean, how people thought that an
alliance was the same as having
a relationship or a bond.
Now we're going to have bonds.
We're going to have a Christian
bond, we're gonna have a bond
that we're African-American,
that we came from the same tribe
originally and went all the way
together and then also just
because we have some social
identities that we can relate to
like the fact that, you know, we
know the brothers and sisters
is chillin' at the barber shop
and they're talking about us.
That is an honorable thing.
But a lot of people thought that
that was an alliance.
So people felt that we had an
alliance and it was the same as
a bond, and it wasn't.
So it really surprised me to
hear some of the things people
said regarding that.
 PROBST: How about you, Neleh,
did you hear anything about
yourself and thought, "Never
knew people thought that about
me"?
 Well, I thought it was kind
of funny-- you know, I came out
here, you know, we all basically
came out here, obviously-- to
play the game for a million
dollars.
I didn't have to really start
getting in and digging my feet
in until day 24, because I
wasn't really a target.
You know, I came out there right
away, you know, me and Paschal
were kind of like, you know, oh,
they can't carry us as much.
We were kind of treated a little
bit that way.
So it was... It was different
for me, I guess, to see people
kind of put me in like this
sweetheart role and then also
put me in this competitive
role.
And people couldn't like put the
two together.
They're like, she's either
sweet or she's competitive.
If she's sweet... or if she's
really competitive, then the
sweetness must be a cover-up.
So, that was pretty different
for me.
 PROBST: Well, there's no
arguing, I think Sean said it,
you two played better than the
other 14, no matter what they
may try to tell you later or
argue otherwise.
You're sitting here.
They aren't.
We're gonna find out now, of the
two of you, who played the best.
I want to poll the jury.
Has anybody talked about their
vote with anybody else?
Cool.
Votes tonight...
 (laughing)
 PROBST: ... are a little
different.
You're not voting somebody out.
Tonight, you're voting for
somebody.
You're voting for a winner.
You want to see your name on
this parchment tonight.
There are seven votes.
It takes four to win.
At stake for the winner: Brand-
new Saturn View truck, color of
your choice...
title of sole Survivor and a
million bucks.
I'll read the votes.
 Oh, gosh.
Come on!
(cheering)
First vote...
Vecepia.
(cheering)
Vecepia.
Two votes, Vecepia.
Neleh.
Two votes Vecepia, one vote
Neleh.
Neleh.
Two votes each.
Takes four to win.
Three votes Neleh.
Two votes Vecepia.
Vecepia.
It can't get any tighter.
Three votes V, three votes
Neleh.
 Oh, dang.
 PROBST: One vote left.
(cheering)
The winner of Survivor
Marquesas...
Vecepia.
(cheers and applause)
(cheering continues)
 God is good!
God is good!
(cheering continues)
(tribal music playing)
