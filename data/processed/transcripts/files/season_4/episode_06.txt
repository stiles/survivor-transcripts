         PROBST: Previously on
Survivor...
Maraamu found a new source of
food...
(screams)
...and won a crucial reward
challenge and got to raid
Rotu's camp...
Maraamu, prepare to raid.
 It was amazing.
We got everything.
 PROBST: ...which caused Rotu
to become a more unified tribe.
 Everyone just felt like they
had a purpose in the tribe.
 PROBST: But unity was
fleeting when John became
suspicious of Gabe's behavior.
 Are we staying tight?
Is that the deal?
 PROBST: The tiny Maraamu








tribe also won their first
immunity.
(cheering)
And John took steps to oust
Gabe.
 We vote Gabe, tomorrow.
 PROBST: Rotu went to their
first Tribal Council, where Rob
went along with the vote, but
had a message for John.
 I know exactly what you're
doing.
First chance I get, I'm going
to get you.
 PROBST: And Gabe was voted
out of the tribe.
Gabe, the tribe has spoken.
11 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
 The four original Rotu
Who will be voted out tonight?
 The four original Rotu
members, Zoe, myself, John and
Tammy, we made ourselves a
little pact that we're going to
try to control this and take it
down to be the final four
people.








And right about now, we're
feeling pretty confident that we
are in control.
 It's, like, no line of
B.S. what I'm saying.
I mean, if we do it right, the
winner will come out of this
group.
I mean, I've been waiting for us
to lose one so that I could,
you know, that I could get rid
of Gabe, so...
My leadership has emerged since
we voted Gabe out.
There was definitely a shift,
basically now everyone knows I'm
the leader.
Everyone knows that I'm running
the show.
If we were to lose our next
immunity challenge, we're up
four-three.
So to be honest, the reward
challenge is the one that we
want today.
No matter what it is, we just
make sure our best personnel are
there.
And maybe not put as much focus
and effort into the immunity
challenge that comes up after
that.
 John has made himself the
power guy in our little group.
That's fine with me.
Right now, it's time for me to
sit back, relax, let him take
the grief.
He's going to be the one who's
going to be the target.
 Maybe it's my new tribal
baptism or whatever you want to
call it, but I got silly and
decided to go skinny-dipping.
Hey, Rob, I'm going to jump off
naked.
There I was with the original
Rotu people, and after voting
Gabe out, it was like being able
to wash off all that other stuff
and like starting new.
That was definitely a powerful
moment.
Symbolically, it's just showing
that there's another level
of our relationship with
each other.
I would not be comfortable doing
that with the other three.
 Only chance we got now, hope
we win immunity tomorrow, and
there's a merge.
We've got to hook something up
with the other side.
Otherwise, we're going out.
Without a doubt, we're
outnumbered 4-3.
By losing Gabe, we definitely
put ourselves at a big
disadvantage.
We know they got four, we got
three.
They're knocking us off one at a
time.
And these smoochers...
 And V.'s definitely...
I don't know what V. is doing,
but she's definitely
disassociating herself from
us in a real clear and
visible manner.
 V's driving me crazy because
it's just so obvious what she's
doing.
I don't trust V.
I never trusted V.
I'll tell you one thing, Sean,
my main goal is to get rid of
him.
Just because he's so full of it.
If I have any opportunity at
all to get rid of John, I will.
I don't have an angle yet.
I don't have a strategy yet, but
if I have any opportunity at all
to get rid of him, he will be
the first to go.
And if we lose the immunity
tomorrow, yeah, it's probably
going to be me or you.
 On this side, there's more
time to be casual because you
don't have to work at gathering
food.
It's just right at your
fingertips.
 Paschal, did you find any?
 Well, I see one.
Where there's one, there's more.
Physically, we're not a match
for the other team and we
know that.
But we just approach it as best
we can.
I mean, you can only do what you
can do and you can't worry about
it.
 Holy Mother McGrady, look at
this dude!
 You got that side?
 I got this side.
 Good job.
 I was always concerned that
having this small little band of
women and one older gentleman
was going to be very difficult
to win.
But now that I'm here, it's
totally about spirit and energy
and desire.
 Oh, baby come here.
Where is that pincher?
Oh, no, you don't!
No, you don't.
Golly...
 You booger!
You booger!
Booger head!
No!
(yells)
 You sorry sun of a gun, you!
Wow, he got me double.
 Damn!
Woo, look at that.
Oh, my God.
No wonder it hurts to get
pinched.
We did not eat as well at Rotu
because we had more tribe
members and less food.
 We'll have to bowl them up
right away.
 We did not eat in the
morning, we did not eat at
lunch, we only had dinner.
That was great, Paschal.
I was just waiting for them to
pop out of the hole.
 Yeah, you've got to, if you
just find one going back.
 Yeah, that was timing.
 Okay, we know where to come
anyway.
There you go.
Good one, Kathy.
 Yeah.
God, they're strong.
 If we can win this one, the
way we're eating, and you know
what they're eating.
You got to believe what they're
not eating.
 I think they're more worried
about the food than immunity,
because they probably already
have their alliance.
They already know who they're
going to boot.
 I'm totally looking forward
to see which one of my old
members got kicked off.
 It's going to be a shock to
us if it wasn't one of her old
members, because I think we're
all assuming it's going to be
one of two people.
 I think it's going to be Rob,
the others think it's going to
be Sean.
So it will be interesting to
find out.
 You guys, this is done.
 The food over on this side is
so much easier to get to than
the food over at Rotu.
It's just, it's unbelievable,
it's like night and day.
 And it's so fresh.
 We don't need the food like
they need it, I'm confident of
that.
 Let's see what do we got
today.
Oh.
Sushi?
 Oh, it's going to be food!
 Yeah, it is.
 "It's time to visit a
mystical place.
The perfect setting for your
next race.
Across land and sea, in the
fastest time, the first tribe
finished sits down to dine!"
Yes!
 There is no way they're
going to beat us.
 No way.
 No way in hell, and if there
is any food at the finish line,
that's motivation enough.
 Rock and roll, man.
 Rotu!
 They voted Gabe off.
 Rotu!
 They voted Gabe off.
 Oh!
 What?
 PROBST: Right in front here,
Rob.
Okay, let's get to today's
reward challenge.
It is a jungle relay race.
Here's how it works.
Four members from each tribe
will compete.
There are three legs to the
relay.
In the first leg, one member of
each tribe will race through the
jungle until you reach a paddle.
It's tied with knots.
You'll untie it and continue on,
tagging a tribe member along
the way.
You must stay together.
Both of you will find another
paddle that's tied up.
You'll carry both paddles to the
second leg, which is a pile of
coconuts.
Hidden inside is a key.
Start breaking the coconuts open
until you find it.
Then pass the key and the
paddles off to the other two
members of your tribe.
For the third and final leg,
those two members will use the
key to unlock your outrigger
canoe.
You'll paddle out, retrieve your
flag, turn around, paddle back,
and drop your boat on the beach.
The outrigger must be within
reach of your chain.
First tribe to get both paddlers
back to the tiki and place their
flag on top wins reward.
Want to know what you're playing
for?
 Yes.
 PROBST: First thing, nice,
hot, humid day like today,
something a little cold, a
little Sierra Mist.
 Oh, that's so cold, look at
it.
 Oh!
 PROBST: Here's a little
sampling of what's waiting for
you.
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Chicken, quiche, bean
salad and a really nice
dessert.
Okay.
Rotu, because you have seven
members, you're sitting three
out.
Which four are participating?
Okay, V., Sean, Tammy, you guys
are sitting this one out.
First two, head to the start,
wait for my go.
Here we go, guys.
Survivors ready!
Go!
 Take it easy, Rob!
 Go, Paschal!
Go, baby!
Come on, Paps, you got it.
 Take it easy, Rob.
 Good job, Paps!
Come on, Paps, you got it.
 Want me to hold the paddle?
 I got it, I got it.
 I see it, the change in the
knot right there.
 They change it halfway.
 Very good, nice and steady.
 Okay, Paps, ready?
 Go.
 Let's go, Paschal!
 Let's go, Rob.
All right, you can do it!
 Come on.
 Take your time.
 Take your time, take your
time.
 Come on, Paschal!
 We got it, come on.
 Go!
 The paddle!
The paddle! The paddle!
 Ready? One, two, three.
 Which side?
Come on...
Rob, stop, stop, stop.
 One on one side, one on the
other.
On this side, my side, my side.
Turn us around.
Row on the outside this time.
 What are they doing?
 You guys!
 I'll go on the inside, you go
on the outside.
 PROBST: You're still in this,
let's go!
 Come on, you guys!
 Steer, steer, you need to
steer.
I'm rowing, you steer.
Steer.
 Come on, girls, way to go!
 Steer, steer, steer.
 Good job, girls.
 Rob, steer, don't row!
I'm going to row.
Steer.
Put your paddle in.
There you go.
 Good job, come on, guys!
 Sharp, sharp, sharp.
 Come on!
Oh, yes.
(cheering)
 Come on!
 Come on, Rotu!
 Go!
(all yelling encouragement)
 PROBST: Pull it to your
chain.
Pull it to your chain!
 Come on, guys.
Come on!
 Push, push.
Run!
 Get the flag!
Get the flag!
 PROBST: Rotu!
 Rob wasn't here.
Rob wasn't here.
 You're right.
 Rob wasn't here!
 PROBST: Hold up, I got to
check something.
Maraamu is protesting.
To win, your boat has to be
within a chain length, and both
paddlers have to be at the tiki.
The boat has to be within the
chain link, Maraamu's boat is
all right.
Rotu's boat is not okay.
In addition, the General was not
at the tiki when you put your
flag in.
I spoke too soon, I'm sorry.
Rotu, you do not win.
Maraamu wins.
Feast.
 Yes!
 Oh, my God, look it's a
picnic!
 I love picnics.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Oh, my God, look at all the
drinks!
Oh, my God, there's ice!
Oh, my God.
 God, my hands are shaking.
Here.
 Can we get a couple more
Sierra Mists?
 Oh, my gosh.
 I cannot believe it.
 We can each have a half.
 Oh, my God, they have French
baguette.
 Oh, my gosh, you guys,
this chicken is incredible.
Oh, my God, have you tried the
bean thing?
It is so good!
What's in here?
It's like a relish or something.
 The challenge was very
exciting.
It was a relay challenge.
It was definitely a reward that
we needed.
Not necessarily did we need the
food, but we needed to keep Rotu
away from the food.
 I honestly have probably had
20 cookies.
I kid you not.
 Me, too.
We have to eat slowly,
so we can eat longer.
 It's so hard though.
 Oh, it's so hard.
 God, I feel so bad.
Why were they so grumbly?
Would we have been that grumbly?
 I got to tell you, it was
utter disbelief this morning.
 Oh, Gabe?
Shocked.
 Absolutely shocked.
 I mean, I was really shocked.
Honestly when we were over
there, Gabe was probably the
strongest member of our team
over there, he did everything.
So there's got to be some big
quarrelly stuff going on over
there.
 I mean, I think it's a
consensus that we all feel like
a family here, us four, I mean,
it's truly a family.
 I'll tell you what, it's
heaven on earth.
An old guy like me with three
women?
Does it get any better than
that?
No.
 I love when you say that.
(belching)
 That's going to make me throw
up.
 Gross.
 I'd rather you thrown up.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Three quarters of the time
that we're out here, we spend
fantasizing about food.
So it was a huge, huge
disappointment when they said
that we didn't win.
 They'll probably end up with
an upset stomach all that food.
 I hope they puke right after
they eat it.
 I ran the race, I smoked
everybody.
I did my part.
I handed the key to dumb and
dumber, and they proceeded to
screw up the rest of the race
for us.
Maraamu is over there having all
kinds of good food.
And we're over here eating
roots.
 It wasn't that big of a deal
to me to lose that challenge.
To me, it was just a meal.
And I avoided apologizing.
Because I am in a leadership
position, and I'm not going to
apologize because we lost.
Those guys are going to just be
crapping their brains out.
Those four over there, they're
going to be sick as dogs.
The food looked great.
But cucumbers, green peppers and
beans.
High, high gas foods.
High.
We would bloat up in a second.
A lot of that stuff I wouldn't
have touched.
Two hours of yum-yum would not
be worth, you know, three days
of ... your brains out.
That one little meal don't mean
nothing.
 We've got 26 days left.
We didn't come out here to eat
fried chicken and quiche.
 There you go.
 We came out here to play the
game and win the game, and
that's what we're going to do,
bottom line.
 This is the Tony Robbins
crew, boy.
Let's take this show on the
road.
 We have taro, we have
coconut.
Even though we have it every
day, we keep tricking ourselves
that John's cooking up something
new.
See what happens when you got to
use your imagination?
 What I do is, I cook the
seafood first, then I pour it
off the juice.
I kept some little white pieces,
and I put in some coconut, and
then I put in the taro.
 This isn't that bad.
It's not fried chicken, but it's
not bad.
 Great recipe.
 I'm fooled.
 I still say the chicken would
have been the bomb.
But here's the bottom line.
He said maybe like you would
crap your pants.
What else we got out here but
nature and opportunity?
 "In the jungle, insects
creeping,
In the love shack,
eight friends sleeping.
We've got fire, food and
shelter
Water for the tropic swelter
And a pig pit set with spongy
bait."
I don't say it as good as him.
 Gabe had written Paschal a
poem while they were all over
there at Rotu the first ten
days.
And Paschal and Gabe bonded like
father and son.
Paschal doesn't have any sons,
and he has said repeatedly that,
if he had a son, he would, you
know, love for him to be just
like Gabe.
 Can you hand this back to
Paschal?
 Thanks.
 That's really special.
 This morning when I saw Rotu
for the first time, I was
flabbergasted.
And really, I was bitterly
disappointed, because I know
what it was like when we were
there and what Gabe offered.
23 years old.
What a kid.
You know, all the people over
there, I still love dearly,
but it's different now.
I mean, we are who we are now,
and that's in the past.
 Oh... It makes me so mad.
He should not have been the one
that left.
 He was very talented.
Yeah, he should not have been
voted off.
(sniffs)
 I knew that would break his
heart today when we saw him
gone.
 I think the mood in our tribe
is very relaxing, it's very
peaceful.
And we're at a point where we
can just basically hang out.
 It's all in the breathing?
 Uh-huh, it's for breathing,
and to just de-stress yourself.
 So how long is this...?
 Chi gong.
 Chi gong?
 Five minutes.
 Kathy's awesome.
Kathy's got a really good
spirit.
She's very go get 'em, and I
think she's probably a little
more adventurous than I am,
even.
 What does that do?
 Just gets you going.
 Oh, okay.
 And then you can go lay down
on the couch, turn on football.
Pop open a beer.
 Gina fits in, for sure.
I mean, we fit in with Gina.
I think at the beginning, she
was tentative, but she's
definitely coming out of her
shell, so that's a positive.
But I think there's a little
undertow of politics in our
tribe.
 Have you ever felt each
other's words by just putting
out your hands?
 Paschal's looking at us
like...
 Wait, wait, you got to go
slowly.
Now tell me when you feel the
heat.
I can feel it.
Can you feel that?
You can't feel the heat?
Paschal, you're numb.
You're old and numb.
 That's it.
 I'm definitely worried about
the Paschal-Neleh bond and that
Gina's going to step into my
shoes.
 Neleh.
 Yeah.
 Close your eyes.
Close 'em.
Keep them closed.
I just want you to sniff.
Tell me what you smell.
What do you smell?
 Hold on.
It's really sweet.
 Mm-hmm.
 Candy?
(gasps)
 It's soft.
So we're going to cut it.
 Yum!
 I think Gina is part of our
tribe like there's no more Rotu,
and we're just one big tribe
together and that's how I'm just
going to finish playing the
game.
 Oh, man.
 I can smell it from here.
 Good gracious.
 I love Gina to death and I
feel closer to her now than I do
some of my other tribe members.
Good little picker!
 As soon as they got Gabe
kicked out, I knew there was an
alliance with those four Rotu
people.
I just wanted to see them lie to
me to my face, when I asked them
if there was or not.
Can I ask you a question?
You, the General, Tammy and
John, you guys don't have an
alliance, the four of you?
 We have a friendship, not an
alliance.
 That's interesting.
I knew she was lying the second
she told it to me.
I could just tell.
Don't sit there and tell me that
I'm 100% honest and everything
is 100% legit and then turn
around and lie to me and stab me
in the back.
Because, game or no game, I
won't forget it.
You know what I'm saying?
 I understand what you're
saying.
 I don't trust Zoe.
At this point, I don't trust
anybody in the game except
myself.
 I mean, if we win tomorrow,
the game is still alive for us.
What's up, man?
 Pretty much I had had it with
the quiet treatment from John
and the rest of the four-member
cast of Rotu over here and I
wanted to get things out in the
open.
You're telling me straight up
that you four don't have an
alliance?
You four over here?
 No, how could you say that we
don't?
I mean, you'd have to be blind
not to see that.
 Zoe just told me straight up
in my face not even five minutes
ago, John.
 Maybe she's not thinking that
way.
 John.
 Hey, have I ... you yet?
 Do I have "stupid" written on
my forehead?
 I'm saying, in my mind, yes.
 There's definitely an
alliance.
 Absolutely.
 All right, that's what I'm
saying, you're being honest
right now.
I appreciate your honesty.
 But if we're going to talk
about that, then we also have to
look at, you know, when we were
going to vote out Gabe.
Your behavior to me completely
changed and you were trying to
figure out maybe another
scenario to take out me.
 Not you in particular, but
somebody on that.
 Look me in the eye and tell
me it wasn't me.
 It wasn't you.
 Uh, huh, yeah, right.
Do I have "stupid" written on my
forehead?
But you guys are our team.
You're here.
We have strength in numbers.
If there's a traditional merge
and we all merge at the end,
three of them and seven of us,
those three go first.
That is my absolute word.
Only thing is that freaks me
out, I don't trust you.
I don't trust you.
 I promise you I won't try to
like swing to the other side or
anything like that.
I promise you I'll tell you
straight up.
 I'm giving you my word 100%,
we will not get over there and
try get those old Rotu people to
vote you out.
It will not happen, okay?
And don't try to ... me.
Okay.
I'm taking your word.
 I will.
 Okay.
 Same thing buddy.
 I think to a degree, I may
have convinced him that I'm part
of the team now.
I want him to trust me, but he
shouldn't.
Are you gay, dude?
 Eh, don't ask me that.
 You don't want to say that?
 Yeah, I am.
It was very passive aggressive,
like a throw away comment, "Hey,
are you gay?"
But, you know, hey, I'm 36 years
old.
I've been out for a long time,
so I said, "Yeah, you know, I
am."
I said, thanks for outing me,
you know.
But this 36-year-old gay boy
from Omaha is running the show
and just whipping his pants.
 This immunity challenge is
critical to me.
If we don't win this challenge,
then I'm probably gone tomorrow.
Sean, V. and Tammy definitely
have to play in today's immunity
challenge, because I sat out
yesterday.
I'm going to be the fourth
member, I'm not going to back
down, I want to participate.
If we lose and this is my last
one, at least I want to know
that I gave my best.
Don't count me out.
 Tammy and the General and I
have had a couple conversations
about if we were to lose the
next immunity challenge, who
would be the next person to go.
I'm just saying, I mean, I'm
trying to stay two steps ahead.
Rob is desperate to do
something.
I think we sit in a much better
place if we don't have Rob at
the merge, period.
He is a little bit dangerous and
we have one opportunity to get
rid of him.
My gut is screaming to me that
it would be better if we
actually lost this challenge and
lost that voice, and that person
that Rob represents that's so
dangerous.
 But the thing is, I'm not
throwing immunity.
I can't go in there and not try.
 Just don't do anything extra
to, like, help them if they're,
like, falling behind.
I'm serious.
We're talking a million dollars
is at stake here.
What I was trying to say to
Tammy is there are certain
battles that you definitely need
to win and there are certain
battles that you don't.
 I hate the fact that I'm in
this challenge and you don't
want to win this.
 I don't know what to tell
you, it's better if he's just
gone.
 To be completely honest, I
mean, I don't know what I'm
going to do when it's time to
step up to the plate for today's
challenge.
I just don't know.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Welcome.
First things first.
Immunity is back up for grabs.
Today's immunity challenge is a
giant maze.
Hidden within the maze, five
rungs that each tribe will use
to build a ladder.
Each tribe will start next to
each other.
You'll head in opposite
directions to find the first
rung.
First tribe to collect all five
rungs in order from one through
five, build the ladder from top
to bottom, get to the top of the
ladder, one person with your
flag, wins immunity.
To make it interesting, you'll
be tied together during the
process.
At stake, the vote.
Win tonight, guaranteed one in
ten shot of being the sole
survivor.
Lose, your tribe goes to Tribal
Council, another person voted
out of the tribe.
Rotu, because you have three
extra, you'll sit three out.
Pick your four.
We'll get you tied up.
Kathy is leading Maraamu
Rob is leading Rotu.
John, General, Zoe, you're
sitting out.
Survivors ready!
Go!
 Left, left, left, left.
 More?
 Remember that.
Ready, left.
We're going left.
Go left.
 Let's pick it up.
 Left, left, left.
 Okay, turn around.
 Okay.
 Remember that.
 Come on, we've got to move
faster.
 Right, go right.
 There's something over here.
 Okay, what's this?
 Yellow.
 Yellow, but what number?
 Two.
 Two.
Two dots.
 Keep going.
 Yes!
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry up, guys.
Hurry up.
 Come on, we got to move
faster.
Okay. Number 4.
There's a ton of blue over here.
Inside, inside.
 PROBST: Rotu takes an early
lead.
 I want to get to the other
side, you guys.
 Okay, we're right behind you.
 I know, I just want to tell
what you I'm doing.
 Right there, go left.
Go left, Rob.
 Okay.
 Yes!
 Hurry up, quick.
 Okay, we need three.
 Way to go, Rob, way to go!
 PROBST: Big circular maze,
guys.
 Way to go, Rotu.
You're doing great.
 Yes, yes, yes, yes.
 Hurry up, hurry up.
Hurry up, guys.
 Okay, we got one.
Let me go.
Three is going to be over here.
Here we go, back here.
Wait a minute, I got to get my
bearings.
To get back in the center, I
think we have to go around
this way.
 PROBST: Rotu has three.
 Here we go.
Come on.
 Back this way.
 PROBST: Maraamu, finally on
the board.
 Okay, guys, help me get back.
Okay, help me get back.
 Hurry up!
 Okay.
 Go. Go.
 Three is this way.
 PROBST: Rotu has three,
Maraamu, two.
 Come on, come on, come on.
Left, right, left, right.
 Kathy, the other way.
 What?
 Go back the other way, honey.
 That was four, that wasn't
three.
Why can't we get around this
thing?
Come on.
We've got to get to the outer
rim.
We can't, that dead ends?
 Go this way, go to the right.
 This way, Kathy, this way.
 That's not it.
 We've been that way a hundred
times.
 No, we've got to get over
there.
See, over there?
 Let's move, let's move.
Okay.
Left, right, left, right.
 PROBST: Rotu has four,
Maraamu two.
 Come on, this is it, last
one.
 Let's go, let's go.
 You guys, we got to move
faster.
Nothing.
 Double-time, baby.
 Double-time.
 Come on.
 Go.
(shouting)
 PROBST: Rotu wins!
 You guys, slow down.
 This is it.
 This is what it's all about.
 PROBST: Maraamu, I'm sorry to
say, Tribal Council tomorrow
night with me, one of the four
of you is going home.
 How was your day?
 Good.
I got troca and cowrie.
 Are you serious?
Lots?
 Four troca and I think
five...
 Good job.
 When we got back there wasn't
fire, so I was feeling pretty
bad.
You know, I did not do a good
leadership role in the maze, and
we got back and I drowned out
the fire.
 You got to take the sand out.
 I lit it this morning without
taking the sand out.
 Gina and I sort of go back
and forth about putting sand on
the fire.
I always put sand on the fire
at Rotu and it worked like a
charm.
Maybe the sand was different
over there.
 We're low on firewood, so we
just... I beefed it up, got a
coal bed and covered it.
 The sand just puts it out if
it touches it.
 What about piling as many
hot coals together?
 These aren't hot.
 Some of them are hot to touch
when I was digging them out.
 They're not anymore.
 She said at Rotu they put
sand on their fire to keep the
coals hot, and I know whenever I
go camping we put sand on the
fire to put it out.
 As much as we were burning,
we just didn't burn enough of a
bed today.
 You don't have to, I mean...
I don't think that's going to
light.
 We just don't have fire.
 I was hoping that we would go
to Tribal Council and vote
tonight after having a
conversation.
But I went to talk to Gina about
it and she felt that we
shouldn't talk about it.
So I'm not going to bring it up.
 These guys do not like to
break through this.
 No, they don't.
 I don't think they have
enough guts right now to talk
about it.
I totally disagree with that, I
think we should just own up to
it, man, just put it on the
table and figure it out and
enjoy the rest of the day.
 We are out of fire.
 Out of fire?
 No fire.
 At all? For sure?
We know that one of us is going
to have to go, and it's a hard
decision.
I don't think they're going to
vote for me just because I
wasn't with them originally.
And I might be wrong, but I
don't feel that way.
I just don't like that sand idea
she uses.
That's how you put out fires.
 That's what I thought, too.
 If I work at strategizing for
myself, I'd have to vote on
Kathy, because I automatically
know that Neleh nor Paschal are
going to vote on each other.
Have you eaten those raw before?
 Hmm-mm.
 You need lemon.
 They're hard as a rock.
 I'm not going to start
tonight either.
 Honestly, I haven't decide
what I'm going to do.
I've been back and forth all
day.
I definitely know I'm not going
to vote Paschal, but between
Kathy and Gina, I'm having a
really tough time.
 Look, on the other side, we
went to bed many a night without
anything.
 We're going to go to Tribal
Council tonight and each member
is going to get up and vote and
it will be a secret until that
very moment.
 PROBST: Okay, let's get right
very moment.
 PROBST: Okay, let's get right
to it.
A lot has happened.
This small little tribe of four,
the true underdogs, has come on
very strong.
Paschal, what kind of tribe is
this?
How different are things now
from the last time you guys were
here?
 If you would have told me
when I left Rotu that we were
going to duplicate what we had
at Rotu, I'd say there's no way.
Not only have we duplicated it,
we have surpassed it.
 PROBST: Really.
So let's talk about loyalties
then.
Kathy, where are your loyalties
now?
 I think there's a spirit of
Rotu still lurking about over on
the other beach.
But it's diminished, and we've
really formed something here
that's united.
I think both tribes have
dissipated and we're creating
something new.
 PROBST: If you merged
tonight, would the four of you
go in together or would it be
hey, Gina, really been fun,
we're going to see if we can
infiltrate back into the
strength of the numbers of Rotu?
 No, we would go as the four
of us, strong.
 Absolutely, four of us.
 PROBST: Neleh.
 Absolutely.
 PROBST: How about you, Gina?
Are you still a black sheep or
are you truly now a tribe of
four?
 We're definitely a tribe.
I would definitely call it even
like a family.
We don't want to vote anybody
off tonight.
 PROBST: Kathy, let's talk
about the immunity challenge
yesterday.
You were dragging these guys
like they were school kids who
didn't want to get up.
At any point, did you think,
yikes, I hope we're still a
tribe here and I hope they're
not going to make me a
scapegoat?
 My head hung low because I
felt that I failed the tribe on
the challenge.
But the other thing is that
there's such a family feeling
between the four of us, that I
felt okay once we got outside
the maze and we got back to
camp.
 PROBST: So if you guys are
such a tight family, how are you
going to vote tonight?
How do you make that decision?
Neleh?
 Every ten minutes, I probably
am thinking someone different.
That's how many times it's gone
through my head today, because I
do not want anybody to go.
 PROBST: Have you made your
decision now?
 Honestly I haven't.
 PROBST: Okay.
It's time to vote.
Paschal, you're first.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
Paschal, you're first.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final, the person
will be asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
Gina.
Kathy.
Gina.
Two votes Gina, one vote Kathy.
Deciding vote...
Gina.
You need to bring me your torch.
 Love you.
 I love you.
 PROBST: Gina, the tribe has
spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Well, you guys kept insisting on
using the word "family" tonight
instead of tribe.
Sometimes, families have to make
hard decisions.
I'm sure this has been one of
the hardest.
You guys can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
 PROBST: Next time on
Survivor...
The two tribes merge into one.
 It's so good to see you.
 Our Heavenly Father, we're so
grateful for each other and for
the bonds that we have together.
 Amen.
 PROBST: But can they all live
happily under one roof?
 Tell the truth for once, will
you?
 Zoe's lying to me.
They're all lying to me.
 Nobody in this game knows
who's telling the truth.
 Don't lie to my face.
 Now it's on, man.
 Miss Kathy, Paschal and
Neleh, you're awesome.
I love you guys.
I understand the vote tonight.
The tribal members that are
left, the tribe mates, I hope
you play well, play good, play
hard.
I just have to say that I've had
the time of my life, and it's
been a wonderful, wonderful
time.
Nothing will ever, ever replace
this experience.
Thanks.
