It's so good to see you.
It's great to be here with you.








 Hey, Ro...
 ROSIE: Yeah, yeah.
 Get off.
You've got a show.
 ROSIE: What?
 You've got a show, get off.
 ROSIE: Now, I've got to get
off?
 Yeah, you've got to get off.
 ROSIE: Damn it, all right.

Let's hear it for Colby!

Give it up for Jeff Probst!








 PROBST: See you, guys.
 ROSIE: The Survivors!
Here's the survivors.
How are you?
 Good, how are you?
 ROSIE: I know what Neleh
thought when it wasn't her name.
 Oh, my heck!
 ROSIE: Oh, my heck!
Well, you know what, you guys
have all been amazing.
This is going to be the greatest
hour of TV because I think this
is the best show on TV.
(cheering)
But what we need to kick it off
in a special way, is a
production number.
So, hit it, Ricardo.

We'll be back with a whole hour
here, from New York City live.
We'll be right back.
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: Hey, we are back, live
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: Hey, we are back, live
in New York City.
Let's give it up for all the
Survivors.
And for a great TV show.
You were you very entertaining.
All right.
Let me ask you this, Vecepia,
how does it feel to win?
 It is the bomb!
 ROSIE: You're liking it, it's
not bad?
 Heck, yeah.
Holy heck.
 ROSIE: How nervous were you
going in?
Today, the whole day were you
having butterflies?
 Oh, yeah, I haven't eaten for
like two days.
 Yeah, I woke up this morning
looking at Leander saying "You
need to go somewhere because you
are driving me crazy."
He was saying, "Come on, baby,
let's do this, let's do this."
I was so glad we went to
breakfast because it calmed me
down but when I got back home,
Leander was there again going,
"I need to go here with you."
I was like, "Oh, my God, you're
making me nervous.
Just go somewhere, please."
When he left, I was able to
pray, meditate and calm
myself down.
 ROSIE: So the moral for the
people at home, in times of
stress, get rid of your spouse.
Now let me say, Neleh, the "Oh,
my heck"-- I gotta say it is my
favorite expression ever to come
out of Survivor.
 I didn't realize how much I
said it.
 ROSIE: I never heard anyone
say "oh, my heck."
Where did you get that from?
 I don't know, it's a Utah
thing.
Everybody in Utah says it.
Since I've been on the show and
everybody says, "You say 'oh, my
heck' all the time."
So, I pick up on everybody else
and everyone in Utah says "oh,
my heck."
 ROSIE: You know, what's funny
is for 13 weeks you say oh, my
heck and then the final episode
someone asked you a question you
don't like and you said, "well,
that sucks" so I got you a
present.
I got you an "oh, my heck" hat.
And then, you know, when you're
really in a bad mood, a "this
sucks" hat.
You can take that home to Utah.
See how that goes over.
 Thank you very much.
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: You and Paschal had
quite a bond.
I don't know what happened.
Quite a bond in the beginning
and all the way through to the
end.
What do you think the
relationship, what was about
each other that you found
appealing?
 You know what?
From day one, it was so weird,
Paschal and I both got on the
little boat that we had to jump
out of and pretty soon, you know
we're up there rowing.
We're like, okay they're not the
strongest so they need to go to
the back.
We're back there paddling with
our legs.
I'm like, "Paschal, do you think
there are sharks that are going
to eat us?"
We just started laughing, and
right away we just had an
instant bond.
I love that guy.
 ROSIE: What was it about her?
Did you think of her like a
daughter?
 Yeah, it was an extension of
home.
Yeah, I'm such a family person,
that I felt like when I first
saw her, before we even were
selected, I told my wife that if
I'm ever selected for this and
this little girl is selected for
it, there is something really
special about her and there
really is.
She is as pristine a young woman
I've ever known outside of my
daughters Rachel and Ashley, who
are the greatest daughters in
the world.
It was just comfort for me
because it was home.
 ROSIE: Yes, well, I've got to
tell you, Neleh.
(applause)
By far the youngest person here,
and you know, this kind of
stuff, that kind of notoriety
and fame and the maneuvering is
hard to do for 40-year-old
adults, but for a 21-year-old
kid, you did all right, young
lady.
You did all right.
Yes, you did.
Now, Kathy, I got to tell.
 Babe, I tried.
 ROSIE: I thought it was you.
 I was working it.
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: I got the tell you,
you were the odds-on favorite in
New York, when it got down to
like six, everybody was like,
"Kathy's going to be it."
And you lost because you didn't
want to show your boob.
What happened with that?
She was acting like she was so
nice and worried.
Your boob might be falling out.
Ha ha, she fell over!
You psyched her out.
 No, no, I didn't.
 She did.
 I have something to say.
 You know what it's like, you
know what it's like when you're
doing anything and you're a
woman and if you're sitting on
the beach, you might be at a bar
and you've got a strapless dress
on and all of a sudden someone
says, "Honey, check it out.
I think it's exposed."
Before you know it you go,
oh, my God.
Your first instinct is to look
down.
Like a guy with his fly down.
 ROSIE: Maybe at a bar, not
when you're holding on for a
million bucks.
 It's like all these people
looking at me.
 ROSIE: No, it's like she
said, Oh, Neleh goes, "Kathy,
look out, there's a snake.
Ha!"
You totally fell for it.
Totally.
 I had way too many people
looking at me.
 ROSIE: Vecepia, you said
early on that you knew you were
going to win in a way that I
thought was interesting.
Tell everybody what that meant
for you?
 I started from the beginning.
I decided to do this and I just
wrote down on a piece of paper,
"I will be a Survivor."
I started that first.
And I began to pray this verse
out of Habakik, that says, you
know, to write your vision down
and make it plain.
I put the sticky note on my
computer at work.
Every day I just kept saying,
hey, you are going to,
I'm going to get that call.
I'm going to be a Survivor.
I got the call a couple days
later for the first interview.
Once I made it on, then I
scratched that out and wrote "I
will be the ultimate Survivor,"
and stuck that on my computer
and every day I said that,
believing in my faith that it
was going to happen.
And regardless of what happened,
I will always be the ultimate
Survivor, but to see God's work
at hand and to know that it was
him, it was all him because I
kept the faith.
 ROSIE: You know, you've got
to dream it to live it.
I've said that from day one.
You have to see it first before
you can live it.
We're going to take a break and
come back with the other
Survivors, including Tammy who
I'm giving the Sue Hawk award
for the most outrageous speech.
Be right back.
 It was because of you two and
Be right back.
 It was because of you two and
your holier-than-thou attitude
and "I'm not going to lie, I'm
not going to cheat.
Let's take this game to a new
level, let's play it with ethics
and morals and integrity."
Well, you guys are hypocrites as
far as I'm concerned.
You may have been the two
biggest liars out on the island.
I don't think either one of you
deserve a million dollars.
But this is a game.
And you guys beat me at my own
game.
You've lied better than I did,
you manipulated better than I
did and you deceived everybody
better than I did, so
congratulations.
(applause)
 ROSIE: Tammy.
Oh, baby.
They're not fooling around with
you, right?
 No way.
 ROSIE: You know, that was all
you needed was the vulture and
if you were drowning on the
street with a glass of water, I
wouldn't even step on your head.
What were you thinking?
What was the point of your whole
rant?
 You know what?
I was pissed off.
I'll tell you.
I mean, I didn't win.
Basically, I just wanted to
let them know that this is
the way I feel.
And that was the way I felt at
that moment.
Granted I've had three months to
adjust now, but that was the way
I felt then.
 ROSIE: Are you still bitter
and hostile?
 Oh, no, I'm in counseling for
that.
 ROSIE: Glad to hear that.
Now, Hunter, the biggest
surprise of this episode, in
my opinion, is that you got
voted off right away.
I was at home, I was stunned.
The only person that looked more
shocked than me was you.
 Not only did I lose the game,
I lost my voice.
 ROSIE: I heard you had a good
night at the bar last night.
(applause)
That's what I heard.
And he's here because he's a
Survivor!
Were you surprised when you
were--
 Yeah, I was, but I knew that
once I saw the first vote and it
was Rob's vote and I knew I was
gone.
 ROSIE: That was it?
No, what you people don't know
is that you are a real top gun
in real life.
I fly F-18s for the navy.
 ROSIE: In the midst of the
war, correct?
And what is it called when you
land on the rough seas?
 Aircraft carrier.
 ROSIE: He's like the real
life Tom Cruise.
(hoots and cheers)
 433 carrier landings.
 ROSIE: Yeah, good for you.
433.
I think you did really well in
representing yourself.
 That's my boy.
 Yeah, and Mama liked you,
too.
Now there was a little romance
going on?
 No romance.
No romance.
 ROSIE: None at all?
 None.
 ROSIE: I'm going to get to
that at the commercial.
All right, my best moment of the
whole island.
You peeing on him.
(laughter)
I mean, just when you think
you've seen it all.
You, John, go, "I need someone
to pee on my hand, and then the
funniest thing is you come
running like, oh, can I
volunteer?
We have a clip.
Look at you running to pee on
him.
Look at this.
 It went in deep.
I need somebody who can pee on
my hand.
 Okay.
 ROSIE: It was the funniest
moment I've ever seen.
(cheers and laughter)
The best was everyone else's
face is like, even Paschal is
like, they don't do this in
Atlanta.
 He tried to do it.
He did not perform.
 ROSIE: You did not have good
bladder control, Paschal.
 A little anxiety out there.
 ROSIE: Now how did you know
had you to do the peeing on the
sea urchin wound?
 Two reasons, if, like
jellyfish or stingrays, it's the
ammonia that's in the urine that
neutralizes the venom.
Then we had some wilderness
training before we started the
game and they reiterated that.
But I have to tell you
something really funny.
When Paschal came down, he
actually tried.
He whipped it out and
everything.
And then that didn't work,
that's when I said does anybody
else have to go to the bathroom?
So then Kathy comes down, and
she had a really full bladder.
 How did you know that?
 The treatment works like,
in like seconds, and she kept
going and she kept going.
And I did not know, you know,
what the polite thing to do was,
pull my hand out and let her
stand there and pee or just
stand there and get peed on.
 ROSIE: Well, you know,
there's a whole new career for
you.
Peeing on other people etiquette
books.
Who knew?
Good for you, for doing that.
For you, Sean, first let me say,
give it up for this man's voice,
singing the way you do, honey.
Not only did I love when you
sang, I think we have a clip of
you singing, but if you notice,
there are parts of your body
that I didn't know was supposed
to go in at that point.
Like his body is so cut, when
you're singing "This Brand-new
Day" and then right around here,
he has like indents.
I don't know.
I've never had that.
I'm 40.
We have a clip of you singing, I
believe.
Take a look at this.
 ♪ Brand-new day
Can't you feel a brand-new day?
♪ Can't you feel a
Brand-new day? ♪
 ROSIE: Work those abs,
I'm telling you right now.
Now a lot of people don't know
you were voted teacher of the
year.
You're a teacher here in Harlem.
 In South Central.
 ROSIE: And what grade do you
teach?
 I teach seventh grade
English.
In South Central, yeah.
 ROSIE: But you also spent
some time on Broadway.
 Yeah, I was in a play with
Bill Irwin a couple years ago,
like in '98.
 ROSIE: What is it that
teaching means to you?
 Well, teaching means more to
me than a whole lot.
I love, you know, specifically
teaching in the hood, if you
will, because I want to see
those young brothers down there
see me and see that you can keep
it real and keep it educated.
And I want them to see me in
them and say, you know, if he
did it, then I can.
 ROSIE: That's a wonderful
thing.
You're amazing out there and a
lot of fun to watch.
We're going to take a break,
come back.
There's more stuff to talk about
all night, right here on CBS.
We are live in New York City.
(applause and cheers)
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: Beautiful.
Really lovely to watch.
You know, the friendships that
developed.
I mean, honestly, in your life,
do you think you would ever
become such close friends with
an African-American teacher from
the hood?
 Well, first of all, Rosie,
I've never thought about
African-American.
I just think, as part of this
game unveiled, the relationships
I don't expect anybody here to
understand this because you
can't unless you've lived this.
The people that have been on
past Survivors know what I'm
talking about.
You develop such a bond, you
would literally die for anybody
up here.
They're closer to anybody in
your life than your immediate
family.
I said on the show that if you
spent the time that we spent
with these people, you would
spend with your good friend, it
would take probably six years
for you to continuous spending
of time with your good friend.
Sean is one of the most
incredible young men I've ever
had the good fortune of meeting
and knowing, and I have been
really blessed to have him in my
life.
 ROSIE: Very sweet.
(applause)
We have Sarah and, Sarah, I got
to say, you-- you the were the
Kimmy of this year's Survivor.
And it's nice to see you brought
your boobs with you because...
(applause)
You making your entrance, Sarah,
is classic Survivor.
It is going to go gown down in
history as the most absurd way
to play the game.
Take a look at her entrance to
the island.
 Sarah's arrival was almost
like Cleopatra, it was like the
servants were paddling and she
is sitting on the crate looking
so marvelous with her boobs
hanging out and her Goldilocks
hair.
 ROSIE: You stand up and do
your hair.
You check your bikini line.
Everyone else is sweating,
trying to lug the food and
you're like, I wonder if I'm
going to get a tan.
And what's this?
You have a boyfriend, right?
 I do have a boyfriend.
He's here tonight.
 ROSIE: Excellent, and night
one you slept next to Rob.
Cutie petootie.
What was that all about, all
your canoodling in the bed?
 Me and Rob became really good
friends.
I don't know what to tell you.
 ROSIE: Really.
I'm really good friends with
Colby, and we've never shared a
cuddle in bed like that.
Uh, Rob, now, how did you feel
this whole experience was for
you?
You're like a Boston guy, a
construction worker...
(cheers and applause)
 ROSIE: Exactly.
You got a million dollar smile,
Rob, and you've got an amazing
manner about you.
How was this experience for you?
 I was glad Sarah brought her
boobs, too.
(laughter)
 Thanks, Robbie.
 ROSIE: Oh, no.
Yeah.
Did you get along well with
everybody?
Did you have any problems with
anyone?
 Over there, you know, Hunter,
how you doin'?
Is he still crying?
Because I got a tissue here.
You need a tissue?
There you go, bro.
 ROSIE: For you, what was the
most difficult part, Rob?
What was the toughest thing?
 I think, I don't know.
It was pretty easy.
Yeah, right, I lost.
Who am I kidding?
I think dealing with the no-no
bites.
I mean, those bugs, they were
incessantly rude.
They killed me.
 Yeah.
Just dealing with those every
day and have to listen to
everybody whine and cry.
 ROSIE: How was it for you
when you went back home to
Boston on the construction site?
Did the guys tease you because
you were...
 Oh, yeah, they teased me.
I lost to a girl.
Puked up my fish.
 ROSIE: Excellent.
With everybody, the way you
looked, I've got to say, Kathy,
you get most improved.
(applause)
 ROSIE: Yeah, look at you.
You look like, you know, you
look like a murderer Unibomber
kind of person.
All of a sudden, you're the
cover of Vogue magazine.
My son came before the show
started, and he met Kathy and he
said to me, "Mom, there is no
way that's the same lady."
 Who is that woman?
It's called a Marquesan makeover
by Mark Burnett.
 ROSIE: It works well for you.
I'm going to give you, Paschal,
the most improved man,
because toward the end there, it
looked like you weren't even
going to be able to walk.
 Rosie, my wife said I had one
foot in the grave and one wasn't
far behind it.
I tell you, I felt like it, too.
 ROSIE: What happened after
you were voted off?
You were sick?
What happened to you?
 Actually, I was at Tribal
Council and Zoe noticed me kind
of getting wobbly.
She said "Paschal, are you all
right?"
I said "Zoe, I don't feel well."
And I sat down.
I don't think I ever passed out,
but John--
 You passed out, dear.
 All right, I was out.
Once I got to...
I went to a hospital and I got a
lot of IVs pumped into me, a lot
of fluid.
I was completely dehydrated.
Completely dehydrated.
 You stopped eating at one
point.
You said, "You know, I'm not
going to eat anymore."
I was like, what?
 ROSIE: For no reason?
You were just sick of the taro?
 You can ask any of them.
It got to the point that you
could not eat that.
It was to the point now that
none of us I don't believe would
eat anything having to do with
coconut or...
 The "C" word.
 It's horrible.
 ROSIE: I think honestly
probably the reason, Neleh that
you didn't get the million
dollars is because you said,
"Does anybody want my mint?"
What were you thinking about
that?
They went and they won the
reward and she and Paschal had a
nine-course dinner and she comes
back, and instead of saying it
oh, it was okay, she's like,
"Oh, my heck, first I had soup,
I had bread oh, my heck, it was
so good, oh, my heck.
Does anyone want my mint?"
 Okay, I have something to
say.
 ROSIE: Okay, go.
Go.
 Okay, first of all, we were
not allowed to smuggle food
back.
It was a nice sit-down dinner.
On my way out, I, like, you
know, had some mints in my
pocket.
No smuggling allowed.
So I was like, okay, so, I'm
like, well, I still want to
share, so I put a couple mints
in my mouth.
No, I did, did I not?
I came back, and I felt bad
explaining the story.
But they don't show everybody
sitting around saying, oh,
please tell me a detail.
Everything that happened.
Then you do and you start
feeling bad.
I'm like, do you want this mint?
It was terrible.
I can't believe I did that.
 ROSIE: Yeah, that was pretty
bad.
I just pictured all the
cameramen there, you know,
filming that going, yeah, you
want a bite of my hamburger?
Totally.
Sean, for you, the horse got to
be the funniest moment.
We got a clip.
The best part is when you said
"balls," you whispered it like
it was a curse word.
Like you know when you're little
and your mom says "Grandma has
cancer."
You're like, "oh, my balls.
Oh, my balls."
Take a look at this clip and
show it.
 The only horses I've been on
are the merry-go-round in
Central Park.
Where does my other foot go?
Okay.
Nice horsey.
How you doing?
Oh, ....
He's biting him.
Oh, my God.
 Come here on this horse.
 With you?
Okay.
Wait, my balls.
My balls.
It really hurts.
Oh, my God.
 ROSIE: You know, Sean, I hate
to ask this, but I really feel
as though all of America is
wondering.
How are your balls?
 Thank God, I got a
girlfriend.
(laughter)
 ROSIE: Working it all out.
Let me tell you, we have more
fun to come.
We have for the entire audience
over 2,000 people, these amazing
tube top/headbands, slash
whatever they are.
We want to thank CBS for that.
Check out Neleh's dad who added
an extra room in their house to
see this.
Take a look right here.
There's Neleh's family going
crazy.
We got more games tonight, we
got more fun, and one more
challenge.
So don't go away.
The reunion continues from
Central Park right after this.

He's my luxury item.
And I figured he was only out
there 15 days, too, so we get to
share the spot up here.
 ROSIE: Good for you.
Were you surprised you got voted
off when did you?
 I was surprised when I found
out I was going to be voted off,
but luckily Rob Mariano came to
me about 18 hours before Tribal
Council and gave me the option
of forming alliance with him and
Sean and V., which I didn't want
(laughter) at least it gave...
 ROSIE: Which you didn't want
to do, oops.

from this experience?
 Without a doubt, being the

I'm happy about that myself.
It's a great feeling and just to
know that so many people are
