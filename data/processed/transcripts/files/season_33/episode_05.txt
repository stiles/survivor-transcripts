 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE MILLENNIAL
TRIBE, FIGGY AND TAYLOR COULDN'T
HIDE THEIR LOVE.
 YOU KISSED HER LAST NIGHT?
 Jeff: AT THE GEN-X TRIBE, A
BLIND-SIDED BRET AND CHRIS
SOUGHT REVENGE ON JESSICA.
BUT DAVID AND KEN WANTED TO SAVE
HER.
 KEN SAYS THEY'RE GUNNING FOR
ME, BUT IT SEEMS A LITTLE
SUSPICIOUS.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL...
 JEFF.
 Jeff: DAVID PLAYED HIS IDOL
FOR JESSICA.








 THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
 Jeff: SAVING HER AND
SENDING LUCY HOME.
LUCY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 Y'ALL CAN LET ME HAVE IT NOW
OR NOT.
IT'S UP TO YOU.
 I'M NOT MAD AT YOU, DAVID.
 I'M NOT EITHER.
I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY.
 I PLAYED AN IDOL TONIGHT, BUT
I DON'T KNOW THAT PLAYING THAT
IDOL WAS THE RIGHT MOVE BECAUSE
I SAVED SOMEONE WHO NOBODY








REALLY WANTS TO WORK WITH, AND
NOW I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL, AND
I'M INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE.
 I OWE DAVE AND YOU SO MUCH,
AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T LISTEN.
I SHOULD HAVE.
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING I
HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY?
I FOUND A SETTING -- A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
IF I'M STILL HERE ON DAY 36,
I'LL RECEIVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
IF I HAD BEEN VOTED OUT, I WOULD
HAVE HANDED IT TO YOU, BECAUSE
YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP ME.
I TOLD KEN ABOUT THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE I WANTED HIM
TO KNOW THAT HE CAN TRUST ME.
SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT BOUGHT
ME SOME MORE GOODWILL.
 OKAY.
 JESS SAYS THAT SHE HAS A
LEGACY AND SHE'S WILLING TO
SHARE IT WITH ME, AND THAT MEANS
A LOT.
I'M GIVING JESS MY FULL TRUST
AGAIN.
 THIS GAME JUST MESSES WITH
YOU SO MUCH.
 WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
EVERYWHERE.
AIN'T NO SHAME TODAY, ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, CeCe.
 WHAT?
 AIN'T NO SHAME IN LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL TODAY.
 AIN'T IN SHAME LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL.
THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS BACK UP FOR
GRABS, SO WE KIND OF HAD AN IDOL
SEARCH PARTY.
 IT'S AN INTERESTING LITTLE
AREA OVER HERE.
 IT IS.
WE OPENLY WERE ON THE HUNT FOR A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
I FELT EMPOWERED THAT I WAS THE
ONLY ONE WHO KNEW TO LOOK FOR A
SYMBOL OF OUR TRIBE, BUT THE ONE
ISSUE WITH AN OPEN IDOL HUNT IS
THAT EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL, AND YOU MIGHT BE SEEN
HAVING FOUND IT.
 SO FRUSTRATING.
 KEEP LOOKING, SUNDAY.
 SO I'M WANDERING THE JUNGLE,
AND THEN I JUST TURN AND I SPOT
ON THE GROUND A LOG WITH OUR
TRIBE'S SYMBOL ON IT.
BUT RIGHT NEARBY WAS SUNDAY AND
CeCe.
AND I'M THINKING, OH, THIS IS
THE WORST, THIS IS THE WORST.
 ANY LUCK?
 NO LUCK.
YOU?
 NO.
 THIS IS EXHAUSTING.
EVENTUALLY CeCe GETS BORED
AND GOES BACK THE CAMP.
SO DOES SUNDAY.
YEP, THAT'S THE SOUND OF AN IDOL
INSIDE ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.
IMMUNITY IDOL.
I FOUND THE OTHER ONE.
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SO FORTUNATE
TO PLAY AN IDOL AND THEN FIND IT
AGAIN THE VERY NEXT DAY.
"CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WILL
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM BEING VOTED
OFF AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."
EXACTLY WHAT I LOVE AND CRAVE.
I'VE TASTED NO VICTORY IN MY
REAL LIFE COMPARED TOOT VICTORY
I FEEL RIGHT NOW IN "SURVIVOR."
IT'S JUST A SHAME IT TOOK ME
UNTIL 42 YEARS OF AGE TO GET IT,
BUT I WANT TO BE THAT GUY,
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO GET ME
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
MILLENNIALS GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW GEN-X TRIBE.
LUCY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: WELL, THERE ARE SO
MANY ELEMENTS TO THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR."
KNOTS AND PUZZLES YOU CAN
PRACTICE IN YOUR BACKYARD.
YOU CAN GO TO THERAPY, LEARN HOW
TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE BETTER,
BUT THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL
OVER, AND YET THEY CAN CHANGE
YOUR GAME JUST LIKE THAT.
EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR BUFFS.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: WE ARE SWITCHING
THINGS UP.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY DROP YOUR
BUFFS.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: WE'RE SWITCHING
THINGS UP.
IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING.
WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO MIX UP
THE TRIBES, WE'RE GOING TO
SWITCH FROM TWO TRIBES TO THREE
TRIBES.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, WE WEREN'T EXPECTING
THAT.
 Jeff: IF YOU DRAW AN ORANGE
BUFF, YOU WILL RETURN TO WHAT
WAS THE MILLENNIAL BEACH.
YOUR NEW TRIBE NAME WILL BE
VANUA.
IF YOU DRAW A PURPLE BUFF,
YOU'LL RETURN TO WHAT WAS GEN-X.
YOUR NEW TRIBE NAME IS TAKALI.
IF YOU DRAW A GREEN BUFF, YOU
WILL GO TO A NEW BEACH.
YOUR TRIBE NAME WILL BE
EKABOULA, AND YOU WILL HAVE TO
START FROM SCRATCH.
 OH, MY GOSH.
TO HELP OFFSET THAT WORK, YOU
WILL HAVE ONE EXTRA TRIBE
MEMBER.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE SEE WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN?
 YEAH.
 LET'S DO IT.
 GET THIS OVER WITH.
 Jeff: DON'T OPEN THEM YET.
 OH, MY GOD.
 THE SWAP IS RANDOM.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY LIKE ME AND
FIGS, WITH THIS LITTLE ROMANCE
GOING ON.
MY BIGGEST FEAR RIGHT NOW IS
GETTING SPLIT UP.
GIVE ME SOMETHING GOOD, JEFF.
 MOMENT OF TRUTH, BABY.
 Jeff: LET'S DO IT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
IF YOU'RE GREEN, YOU GO IN THE
MIDDLE WHERE THERE IS NO MAT.
HOLD THEM UP ONCE YOU GET IT,
PUT THEM ON.
MICHAELA GREEN AND NOT HAPPY.
 I'M PURPLE.
 PURPLE.
 Jeff: BRET IS GREEN.
JAY IS GREEN.
MICHAELA IS WEARING IT ON HER
FACE.
 CeCe.
NICE THE MEET YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEW
TRIBES.
TAKALI, WE HAVE THREE
MILLENNIALS, THEY -- TAYLOR,
FIGGY AND ADAM, ALONG WITH TWO
GEN-XERS, JESSICA AND KEN.
FIGGY, YOU'RE SMILING BIG.
 I JUST WANT THAT MAN.
 ROCK ON.
FIG-TAILS CONTINUES.
I WAS SO STOKED BECAUSE I'VE GOT
THE NUMBERS, AND I HAVE FIG, SO
IT COULD NOT GO ANY BETTER FOR
ME.
 Jeff: VANUA, WE HAVE THREE
GEN-XERS, CeCe, CHRIS AND
DAVE, AND TWO MILLENNIALS, ZEKE
AND MICHELLE.
ZEKE, YOU WERE ON THE MAJORITY
TRIBE WITH A WINNING STREAK.
YOU'RE NOW IN THE MINORITY ON A
TRIBE OF ONLY FIVE, NOT MANY
PLACES TO HIDE.
 YEAH, IT'S TRICKY.
THE NUMBERS ARE DEFINITELY NOT
IN MY FAVOR, BUT, YOU KNOW, I
LOOK AROUND, I SEE A STRONG
TRIBE.
I SEE A TRIBE THAT I THINK CAN
CONTINUE THE WINNING STREAK.
 Jeff: AND FOR EKABOULA, WE
HAVE FOUR MILLENNIALS, MICHAELA,
HANNAH, JAY AND WILL, AND TWO
GEN-XERS, SUNDAY AND BRET.
MICHAELA, YOU STILL SEEM UNHAPPY
RIGHT NOW.
 YOU DIDN'T DO THIS RIGHT,
JEFF, JUST SAYING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
I'LL TAKE IT.
 I OPEN UP MY BUFF AND I SEE
GREEN.
MAN, I WAS PISSED.
YOU GOING TO SEND US TO AN EMPTY
BEACH WHERE WE GOT TO MAKE THE
SHELTER AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY
FOOD.
I JUST WANT TO FLIP HIM OFF
RIGHT THERE, BUT I DIDN'T.
 Jeff: EKABOULA, MAP TO YOUR
HOME.
GOOD LUCK BUILDING THAT SHELTER.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
HEAD OUT.
GET TO KNOW YOUR NEW TRIBE.
 THIS IS LIKE THE DISASTER
SCENARIO.
I'M ON THE ONE TRIBE WHERE THE
MILLENNIALS ARE NOT IN THE
NUMBERS, AND I'M WITH MICHELLE,
THE ONE PERSON FROM MY TRIBE I
HAVE ZERO TRUST IN.
AND WE'RE OUTNUMBERED, SO WE'RE
IN A BAD SPOT.
 YOU GUYS WANT INTRODUCTIONS?
 OH, YEAH.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
 BRET.
 JAY.
 WILL.
 MICHAELA.
 SUNDAY.
 SUNDAY ANDRY IN SERIOUS
TROUBLE, BUT GEN-XERS, WE HAVE A
DRIVE TO GET THROUGH TOUGH TIMES
IN LIFE AND NOT TO QUIT.
SO WE HIT THE WELL AND THEN
WE'LL GET TO THE SHELTER.
 YEAH.
 SO I NEED TO PROVE TO THEM
THAT I'M WORTH KEEPING AROUND,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT
SURVIVING THIS GAME.
LET'S DO IT.
 ON THE MILLENNIAL SIDE OF
THINGS, EVERYONE SAYS WE'RE JUST
DREAMERS, BUT THE TRUTH IS MOST
OF US ARE RELENTLESS.
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN
INDENTATION IN THAT ONE, SO IT
CAN SIT ON IT?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
 KIND OF LIKE THIS?
THE GEN-XERS SAID WE WORK HARD
AND DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY, BUT
THE PEOPLE I HAVE NOW ARE BRET
AND SUNDAY, AND THEY CAN'T
FIGURE THINGS OUT FOR THEMSELVES
AND THEY SIT BECOME AND WAIT FOR
YOU TO SAY SOMETHING.
 THE KID KNOWS HOW TO DO
EVERYTHING, HUH?
THAT'S COOL, HUH.
 BUT EVEN IF I GOT TO BUILD A
NEW SHELTER, I'M HAPPY BECAUSE
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.
FOUR MILLENNIALS, TWO GEN-XERS,
SEE YA LATER, GEN-XERS, BECAUSE
EVEN IF I LOSE A CHALLENGE, I
DON'T CARE, BOOP, YOU'RE OUT OF
HERE.
 THIS IS NOW YOUR HOME.
 WELL DONE.
SUPER COOL.
SO DIFFERENT THAN OURS.
 YOU GUYS WANT A TOUR?
 LET'S DO IT, MAN.
 WE WENT BACK THE CAMP.
IT WAS INTERESTING.
THE MILLENNIALS DEFINITELY BRING
SOME HIGH ENERGY, SOME GOOFY
ENERGY TO THE TRIBE.
 DO YOU GUYS HAVE A GOAT?
YOU HAVE A COAT.
 IF I CATCH THAT THING, IT IS
DEAD.
HOPEFULLY JESS AND I BEING MORE
GROUNDED AND MORE SOUTHLE WITH
THE WAY WE SPEAK AND THE WAY WE
DO THINGS CAN HELP.
 I'M SO HAPPY.
THIS IS AWESOME.
 SO ARE WE DOING THAT?
 YES.
 EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NUMBERS.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 OH, YEAH.
 NO CONTEST.
 TAYLOR THINKS BECAUSE WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS THAT WE CAN BE OUT
IN THE OPEN.
NO, SORRY, TAYLOR.
I LOVE YOU THE PIECE, BUT BEING
WITH THESE NEW PEOPLE, THAT'S
GOING TO PUT A TARGET ON OUR
BACKS, SO IT'S NOT SMART.
 DOES IT REALLY MATTER, THOUGH
IN.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 THAT MATTERS?
 UH-HUH.
TRUST ME.
 I TRUST YOU.
I THINK IT'S STUPID.
 GET OVER IT.
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO
WHAT SHE SAYS.
 FIGS DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING TO
DO WITH ME.
SHE'S LIKE, STAY AWAY FROM ME,
STAY AWAY FROM ME, BUT I REALLY
THINK THAT US BEING A POWER
COUPLE ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT THAN
TWO PEOPLE IN AN ALLIANCE THAT
REALLY TRUST EACH OTHER.
 THAT'S PERFECT.
LOVE IT.
 I WAS THINKING OF BOIL THESE
SEPARATE.
 OKAY.
 JUST TO SOFTEN THEM, AND THEN
I'LL STIR-FRY THE REST.
 SOUNDS GREAT TO ME.
 GETTING SWAPPED INTO A TRIBE
WITH ONLY TAYLOR AND FIGGY FROM
MY ORIGINAL MILLENNIAL TRIBE IS
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.
FIGGY IS VERY CONTROLLING.
SHE LIES CONSTANTLY, AND SHE'S
GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS CHARADE
AS LONG AS SHE CAN ABOUT HOW
THEY ARE NOT A COUPLE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT WILL
LAST, BECAUSE TAYLOR IS READY TO
START CA NOODLING AGAIN.
TO ME THAT'S A WORTHLESS
PARTNERSHIP.
 HOW DID YOU FEEL OVER THERE,
MAN?
WERE YOU TOWARD THE TOP, TOWARD
THE BOTTOM?
 RIGHT AROUND DOWN HERE.
 BOTTOM THIRD?
 YOU COULD DEFINITELY SAY
THAT.
 WHY'S THAT?
 JUST ASK ABOUT THE FIRST
VOTE.
 WAS YOUR NAME ALSO UP THERE?
 NO, BUT FIGGY'S WAS.
 AND THAT WAS YOU.
WERE YOU THE ONLY ONE TO PUT HER
NAME DOWN?
 ME AND ZEKE AND MARI.
 ADAM IS SUPER NICE.
I FEEL LIKE I HIT THE JACKPOT.
I GOT YOUR BACK, MAN.
SHAKE IT OFF.
 THANKS, MAN.
 KEN AND JESSICA, THEY SEEM TO
HAVE A TIGHT BOND, AND I KNOW
THAT FIGGY AND TAYLOR WON'T TURN
ON EACH OTHER, SO I HAVE PAIRS
ON BOTH SIDES OF ME.
I'M THE GUY THEY NEED TO COME.
TO I'M THE GUY THEY NEED TO WORK
WITH.
I GET TO DECIDE WHICH SIDE MOVES
FORWARD.
 DID YOU DREAM THIS?
 I DON'T DREAM.
I HAVE NO DREAMS.
I VERY, VERY RARELY REMEMBER A
DREAM.
MOISTLY JUST SORT OF WAKE UP.
 MORNING, MICHELLE.
 MORNING.
 MORNING.
 WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU DREAM?
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I
THINK I HAD A DREAM SINCE WE GOT
HERE.
 SO YOU ACTUALLY SLEPT.
 HOW DID IMRU SLEEP?
 NOT TOO GOOD.
MY WHOLE GAME WAS TURNED UPSIDE
DOWN.
I HAPPEN TO BE ON THE ONLY TRIBE
WITH THE MINORITY MILLENNIALS,
JUST ME AND ZEKE, AND THREE
GEN-XERS.
ARE YOU GUYS THINKING WE SHOULD
SLOW COOK THE BEANS?
 I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY.
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED IF WE HAVE
CHALLENGE WE WON'T HAVE TIME THE
COOK THE BEANS.
MY PROBLEM IS THAT THE ALLIANCE
MIGHT BE STACKED AGAINST ME.
SO I'M DEFINITELY SCARED.
 YOU GOT IT, DAVE.
 I MISSED WHERE Y'ALL ARE
FROM?
 OKLAHOMA.
 I'M FROM EDMUND.
 WE'RE THE OCEAN BOYS.
HE'S SOONER NATION.
 PENNSYLVANIA.
 DID YOU PLAY FOR THE SOONERS?
 YEAH.
 WHAT COACH DID YOU PLAY FOR?
 TWO YEARS OF BLAKE, TWO YEARS
OF STOOP.
 YOU'RE ON THE NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP IN.
 YEAH.
 YOU DIDN'T BRING YOUR RING?
 NO RING OUT HERE.
 YOU CAN'T LOSE A NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP RING.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
THAT WAS A GOOD YEAR.
 ZEKE'S AN OKLAHOMA BOY, JUST
LIKE ME, GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA,
PROBABLY AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM
WHERE I GREW UP.
HE'S A BIG SOONER FAN.
OF COURSE, I PLAYED ON THE LAST
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, SO WE
HAVE THAT CONNECTION
IMMEDIATELY.
I'M ALL BROKEN DOWN.
IT HURTS, MAN.
 I AM FEELING BETTER ON THIS
NEW TRIBE THAN I DID AT THE END
OF THE GEN-X, BECAUSE HERE I
FEEL LIKE I HAVE A TAD BIT MORE
CONTROL OVER MY DECISION ABOUT
HOW I'M GOING TO PLAY THE GAME.
 HEY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT
UP FRONT, Y'ALL GOT A CHANCE
BECAUSE ME AND YOU NEED TO TALK
BEFORE ANYTHING JUST BECAUSE
THERE'S THREE OF US DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.
DON'T THINK YOU'RE JUST OUT,
BECAUSE I'M READY TO MAKE A
MOVE.
 CHRIS PLAYED FOR MY TEAM,
UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA SOONERS.
NOT ONLY DID HE PLAY FOR THE
SOONERS, HE WAS ON THE 2000
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.
THESE GUYS ARE MY CHILDHOOD
HEROES.
THAT NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WAS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS OF MY
CHILDHOOD.
 I GOT A GAME PLAN.
WE CAN HASH IT OUT TOGETHER AND
SEE WHAT'S BEST, BECAUSE RIGHT
NOW I GUARANTEE THOSE TWO ARE
GOING TO VOTE YOU ALL OUT, AND I
GOT SOME DIFFERENT PLANS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WHO DO I WANT TO WORK WITH?
I WANT TO WORK WITH THE BIG
GINGER-HAIRED FOOTBALL PLAYER
WHO SAYS, BUDDY, DON'T WORRY,
THINGS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM.
YOU ARE NOT ON THE BOTTOM, AND I
WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.
IT'S LIKE THE HEAVENS OPENED AND
THE LIGHTS SHINED DOWN AND
FINALLY I CATCH A BREAK IN THIS
GAME.
FINALLY I CATCH A BREAK IN THIS
GAME.
SO WE WAKE UP THIS MORNING.
WE DON'T HAVE A FIRE YET, AND
I'M STARVING AND I'M THIRSTY.
 THERE YOU GO.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
 I'M TRYING THE USE THE FLINT.
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I'M TRYING.
I'M TRYING.
IT JUST DOES NOT WORK FOR ME,
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.
I'M JUST LOSING ALL HOPE.
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, FORGET
THIS.
 HAVE AT IT.
 THE FIRE GOT TO A POINT WHERE
JAY GAVE UP.
I WAS EXHAUSTED, BUT I WAS LIKE,
FIRE IS NECESSARY TO OUR LIFE IN
THE GAME.
SO I STARTED TRYING.
DEEPER DOWN, LIKE THERE IS THIS
THEME IN MY LIFE THAT SOMETIMES
I GET TO A POINT WHERE I'VE
GIVEN IT ALL THAT I HAVE AND AM
ALMOST TO THE POINT OF GIVING
UP, AND THEN I PUSH A LITTLE
FURTHER AND THINGS POP.
I WORK FOR THINGS, WORKING TO
PUT MY OWN SELF TO COLLEGE,
WORKING TO PAY OFF MY OWN LOANS.
I WORK.
 THAT'S FIRE.
THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.
NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE!
KEEP IT GOING.
 I HOPE IT WORKS.
COME ON.
 MICHAELA SAID, LET ME TRY.
SHE WENT BERSERK AND ALL THESE
SPARKS START COMING OUT.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BOOM.
WE WERE PSYCHED.
I WAS PSYCHED FOR HER.
THERE YOU GO.
KEEP IT GOING.
MICHAELA, AWESOME!
MAN, IT REALLY BROUGHT US ALL
BACK THE LIFE.
IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, SHE SAVED US TODAY.
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF EMOTIONAL
FOR HER.
 I'M NORMALLY NOT A PERSON TO
CRY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED
SOMETHING SO BAD.
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE NO OTHER
CHOICE BUT TO GET SOMETHING
DONE, IT HAPPENS, AND IT JUST IS
LETTING ME KNOW, LIKE THE LIFE
I'M TRYING TO GET BY WINNING
THIS THING IS WORTH IT.
I DO WANT IT BADLY FOR MY
FAMILY.
THERE'S NOBODY IN MY FAMILY
THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO HAVE SUCCESS
AND KEEP IT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY
GOT SOME TYPE OF PROBLEM, AND I
JUST WANT TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN
HAVE SUCCESS AND YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER.
 MICHAELA, YOU'RE A HERO!
 MICHAELA.
 MICHAELA!
 EKABOULA.
 IS THAT AWESOME OR WHAT?
 I'M TRYING.
 YOU SHOULD BE CRYING BECAUSE
YOU JUST SAVED US.
 YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
 NONE OF US COULD DO THAT AND
YOU GOT IT DONE.
 MICHAELA SAVED THE DAY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST IMMUNITY IMMUNITY CHALLENG
NEW TRIBE?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ZEKE, NEED IT BACK.
 YEP.
 Jeff: WOW.
NICE TOSS.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS, AND TODAY TWO TRIBES
WILL WIN IMMUNITY.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO DIVE DOWN, RETRIEVE A
BUOY, AND SWIM IT TO THE
PLATFORM.
THEN NEXT PERSON GOES.
ONCE YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL FIVE
BUOYS, YOU HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY START
THROWING YOUR BUOYS, ATTEMPTING
TO LAND THEM IN THE BASKET, OR
YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME TO TRY TO
HOOK YOUR BASKET, PULLING IT
MUCH CLOSER, MAKING IT EASIER TO
SCORE.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FIVE WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
IKA BULA, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY
OUT.
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?
WILL GOING TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, FIRST TWO TRIBES
TO FINISH SAFE FROM TRIBAL.
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 COME ON, SUNDAY.
 Jeff: LOOKING FOR THAT

 GOOD JOB.
 Jeff: CeCe HAS HERS FOR
VANUA.
 COME ON, SUNDAY.
 Jeff: SUNDAY STILL WORKING
ON THAT BUT WE FOR IKA BULA.
SUNDAY GOING TO GIVE UP AND SWIM

IT'S GOING TO COST HER TRIBE A
LOT OF TIME BECAUSE SOMEBODY
ELSE WILL HAVE TO SWIM TWICE.

LEAD.

 OH, MY GOD.
 Christa: A HUGE SET BACK
FOR VANUA.
 GET IT RPG DAVID!
 Jeff: AND NOW DAVID LOSES
THE BUOY.
HE'S GOT TO GET BACK IN THE
WATER.
DISASTER.
 DAVID, GET IT.
 Jeff: HANNAH BACK NOW.
GO, IKA BULA.
 IS HE THROWING THIS?
 Jeff: TAKALI HAS ALL FIVE.
YOU CAN START SHOOTING.
KEN NOW GOING TO TRY TO RETRIEVE
HIS BASKET AND PULL IT CLOSER.
DAVID ABSOLUTELY OUT OF GAS, AND
HE'S LOST THE BUOY AGAIN.
GO!
IKA BULA STILL HAS ANOTHER BUOY
IN THE WATER.
THEY'RE GOING TO TO SWIM ALL THE
WAY BACK, GET ON THE PLATT FORM
AND GO AGAIN.
KEN GOING FOR IT, BUT HE'S ALL
KNOTTED UP.
THAT LEAD IS EVAPORATING.
JAY A MONSTER IN THE WATER.
 COME ON, JAY.
COME ON, JAY.
 Jeff: MICHELLE TRYING TO
GET A BUOY.
 MICHELLE, GO.
 Jeff: AND SHE CAN'T GET A
BOW WE.
JAY IS NOW BACK WITH FIFTH BUOY.

CHALLENGE, BUT KEN HAS NOT YET
SCORED.
KEN IN AND OUT.
ZEKE IS NOW BACK.
THEY'RE STILL ONE BUOY SHORT.
GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK AND
COME BACK AND GET THE BUOY.
CAN THEY MAKE UP THE TIME THEY
NEED TO GET IN THIS?
 COME ON, MICHAELA.
 Jeff: KEN MISSES AGAIN.
MICHAELA HOOKS IT FOR IKA BULA.
SHE'S PULLING IT CLOSER.
WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE.
BRET IS IN THE WATER.
HANNAH IN THE WATER.
MICHAELA SCORES ON HER FIRST
SHOT.
IT IS NOW IKA BULA IN THE LEAD.
MICHAELA 2-2, INCREDIBLE.
OH, IN AND OUT.
IT IS NOW IKA BULA IN THE LEAD.
KEN NOW SCORES FOR TAKALI.
 THERE YOU GO.
 WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: CHRIS IS BACK.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE DECISION?
VANUA GOING TO JUST START
SHOOTING.
THERE GOES CHRIS FROM A LONG
WAYS AWAY.
CAN CHRIS FIND THE DISTANCE?
 MICHAELA, TAKE YOUR TIME.
MICHAELA WITH A THIRD FOR IKA
BULA.
 THERE WE GO.
 SHE'S BEEN ON FIRE.
MICHAELA WITH FOUR FOR IKA BULA.
 YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: NO.
CHRIS SHORT AGAIN.
 DON'T GET NERVOUS.
JUST DO IT.
 Jeff: MICHAELA FOR THE WIN.
MICHAELA FOR THE WIN!
YES.
IKA BULA WINS IMMUNITY.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR SECOND PLACE.
 LET'S TRY THE PULL IT IN,
ZEKE.
 Jeff: MICHELLE COMING OUT
OF THE WATER.
ZEKE COMING BACK OUT OF THE
WATER.
THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK THE
TRYING THE LASSO THEIR TARGET
AND BRING IT CLOSER.
AFTER BEING DEAD LAST THE ENTIRE
CHALLENGE, VANUA IS STILL IN IT.
IT IS EVERYBODY'S GAME RIGHT NOW
FOR SECOND.
KEN WITH THE SECOND POINT FOR
TAKALI.
 COME ON.
DON'T STOP.
 Jeff: KEN WITH THE THIRD
FOR TAKALI.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: HE'S ON A HOT STREAK
NOW.
KEN FOR FOUR.
NO.
IT IS A BATTLE FOR THE SECOND
IMMUNITY.
CHRIS LASSOS IT FOR VANUA.
THEIR TARGET IS MUCH CLOSER.
WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
FRUSTRATION SETTING IN FOR
VANUA.
TAKALI HAS HAD A GIGANTIC LEAD.
KEN WITH THE FOURTH.
KEN NEEDS ONE MORE TO SECURE
IMMUNITY FOR THE WIN.
THERE IT IS!
TAKALI WINS IMMUNITY SENDING
VANUA TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IKA BULA, CONGRATULATIONS.
SOMEBODY SWIM OVER AND GET IT.
MICE JOB.
TAKALI, SEND SOMEBODY OVER TO
GET IT.
NICE ENTRY.
GIVE YOU A TEN.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM IKA BULA.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM TAKALI.
YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY
IN THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, SWIM ON OUT,
ENJOY IT.
 CANNONBALL!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
AT THE PRESENT TIME WITH ME
TONIGHT, TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SOMEBODY FROM THIS FIVE WILL BE
VOTED OUT.
SWIM IT IN.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE
CeCe AND DAVID ARE JUST
ATROCIOUS IN CHALLENGES, AND
THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM THE CARE
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS,
BUT THANKFULLY CHRIS IS TRYING
TO MAKE A MOVE, AND IF HE DOES,
A GEN-XER GOES HOME REGARDLESS.
 THAT SUCKS.
 HE WAS TIRED.
 I THREW IT ON THE BASKET.
 I'M SORRY ABOUT THE BUOY.
THAT JUST WASN'T OUR BEST DAY.
 WE GAVE IT OUR BEST SHOT.
 YEAH.
 THIS IS LIKE A NIGHTMARE, A
RECURRING NIGHTMARE.
IT'S LIKE I GO TO SLEEP, I WAKE
UP AND I'M IN THE SAME
NIGHTMARE, BACK THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THE ONE POSITIVE IS FINALLY I'M
NOT ON THE BOTTOM.
 I'LL GET SOME FIREWOOD.
 THIS TIME WE HAVE THE
MAJORITY, THREE GEN-X AGAINST
TWO MILLENNIALS, SO EITHER
MICHELLE OR ZEKE WILL BE VOTED
OFF.
ZEKE CAN DO PUZZLES AND HE'S
STILL STRONG, HE'S STILL PRETTY
DECENT IN THE WATER.
 NO, HE'S PRETTY GOOD.
HE'S STRONG IN THE WATER.
 HE'S STRONG.
 HE'S BEEN PRETTY OPEN ABOUT
WHATEVER YOU ALL WANT.
 DO WE TELL HIM WE'RE VOTING
FOR MICHELLE?
 WHY DON'T WE TELL HIM.
 WE DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
 HUGE NIGHT TONIGHT.
THIS IS A PERSONAL DECISION.
AND QUITE HONESTLY, I'VE MADE A
DIFFERENT DECISION.
 LET'S JUST DO IT.
 CeCe AND DAVE BACKSTABBED
ME, AND ONE OF THEM HAS TO GO
TODAY.
DAVE BIT ME IN THE BUTT A COUPLE
TIME, BUT HE HAS AT LEAST SOME
NUMBERS THAT WILL SURVIVE THIS
THREE-TRIBE SITUATION THAT WE'RE
IN.
I HAVE TO HAVE A BIG ALLIANCE TO
PROTECT ME IN A MERGE, SO WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE CeCe OFF
TONIGHT.
 HEY.
ME AND YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AND
REALLY DIG THROUGH THIS.
WE CAN'T GET RID OF ZEKE.
WE NEED TO THINK THIS THING
THROUGH TONIGHT.
THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT.
IF WE MAKE THE WRONG MOVE...
 YOU THINKING CeCe?
 WELL, I DON'T WANT TO.
 RIGHT.
 BUT WE'RE KIND OF DECIMATED
HERE.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE CHRIS WANTS TO
VOTE OUT CeCe, AND I'M
EXTREMELY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.
CHRIS HAS ON HIS SIDE ZEKE AND
MICHELLE, SO I THINK I SHOULD
JUST GO ALONG WITH THE PLAN AND
MAKE HIM BELIEVE HE CAN TRUST
ME.
 SO IT'S CeCe?
I'LL DO IT, I SWEAR THE GOD I'LL
DO IT.
 I WANT YOU TO THINK IT
THROUGH.
 I DON'T EVEN NEED.
TO.
 IF WE CAN COME TOGETHER, WE
CAN BENEFIT EACH OTHER.
 IF DAVE WILL STAY TO HIS WORD
OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M TRUSTING A GUY THAT'S BURNT
ME TRIES.
 ONCE CeCe'S GONE, IT'S
CHRISTMAS.
 YOU'RE SAFE TONIGHT, BOTH OF
YOU.
 THANK YOU GUYS.
 YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.
 DAVID AND CHRIS SAY IT'S NOT
YOU, WE'RE VOTING CeCe.
HOW DO YOU TRUST IT?
 NO MATTER WHAT IS SAID AT
TRIBAL, VOTE FOR CeCe.
 AND IF IT'S NOT, I'M GOING TO
BE THE FIRST ONE TO EVER CHOKE
DAVID IN FRONT OF NATIONAL TV.
 THERE'S A THOUSAND
POSSIBILITIES HE'S NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH.
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT BECOME AND
LET OTHER PEOPLE DECIDE MY FATE
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW I'M USED
TO DOING THINGS.
 I FEEL SO DEFEATED.
 IT'S SO TOUGH, YOU KNOW?
 THIS GAME IS JUST LIKE... YOU
KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT IT'S
EITHER ME OR YOU PROBABLY.
BUT I KNOW I HAVE GREAT UPPER
BODY STRENGTH, I'M GREAT WITH
PUZZLES.
I JUST DON'T SEE A BENEFIT IN
KEEPING DAVE.
 YOU DEFINITELY HAVE A POINT.
 YOU KNOW SINCE WE'RE ON THE
BOTTOM, WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE A
DEAL.
 OH, YEAH.
 I TRIED TO TALK STRATEGY WITH
HER, AND I CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.
SO ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS
HOPE THAT DAVID AND CHRIS ARE
TELLING ME THE TRUTH AND HOPE
FOR THE BEST.
 SHE WANTS TO VOTE YOU OUT.
 VOTE ME OUT?
WHY DOES SHE WANT TO VOTE ME
OUT?
 BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WEAKEST
AND YOU'RE CLUMSY.
 THAT'S WHAT EVERY GIRL SAYS
ABOUT ME?
 CHRIS AND I TALKED, AND WE'VE
DECIDED THAT WE'D WORK WITH THE
MILLENNIALS TO VOTE FOR
CeCe.
BUT I REALLY DON'T TRUST
MICHELLE.
SHE WANTED TO WOO CeCe OVER
AND TARGET ME.
ONCE CeCe IS GONE, I WOULD
BE THE WEAKEST PERSON OF OUR
TRIBE, AND I WORRY THAT CHRIS,
MICHELLE AND ZEKE COULD FORM A
VOTING BLOC AND VOTE ME OUT IN
THE NEXT TRIBAL.
AND IT'S GOT ME THINKING WHETHER
OR NOT I SHOULD GIVE MY IDOL TO
CeCe AND THEN VOTE OFF
MICHELLE?
I PLAY A LOT OF CHESS, AND THE
THING ABOUT CHESS, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO MY A GOOD GAME, YOU
HAVE TO LOOK AS MANY MOVES AHEAD
AS YOU CAN.
AND IF IT MEANS BETRAYING AN
ALLIANCE OR PEOPLE THAT TRUST
YOU, DO IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE TODAY.
ZEKE, THIS IS YOUR FIRST
CHALLENGE AS A NEW TRIBE.
WHAT WERE THE STAKES?
 WELL, I THINK FOR MICHELLE
AND I, WE SEE THAT WE'RE CLEARLY
ON THE BOTTOM.
WE KNOW THAT THE MILLENNIALS ARE
DOMINATING THE OTHER TWO TRIBES.
WE BOTH ENDED UP HERE, ONE OR
TWO OF US IS GOING HOME.
 Jeff: DAVID, WHEN YOU HAVE
A THREE AND A TWO, THERE'S
ALWAYS ONE IDEA, WHICH IS WHO IS
THREE ON THE THREE?
WHO IS THE BOTTOM?
BECAUSE WE'LL MAKE YOU TOP OVER
HERE.
 THAT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION, BUT
I DO FEEL THE GEN-X THREE
SITTING UP HERE TONIGHT ARE VERY
STRONG, AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF
US HAVE THE INSECURITY THAT
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM, BUT OF
COURSE THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
TRUE.
 Jeff: ZEKE, THERE IT IS.
YOU TALK ABOUT BEING THE BOTTOM,
YOU CAN BE THE TOP IF YOU CAN
GET ONE OF THESE THREE TO JOIN
YOU.
THAT'S THE TRICK.
I KNOW IT'S INTIMIDATING.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH A MILLENNIAL BECAUSE YOU
SEE A MASSIVE MILLENNIAL
ADVANTAGE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO MOVE FURTHER IN THIS GAME
WITHOUT CONNECTIONS TO
MILLENNIALS, AND I PROVIDE THAT,
AND I'M READY TO MAKE A MOVE
WITH THE GEN-XERS IF THAT'S WHAT
I NEED TO DO.
 Jeff: CHRIS, "SURVIVOR" IS
A BIG GAME WITH A LOT OF MOVING
PARTS, AND THE THOUGHT THAT ALL
THE MILLENNIALS ARE GOING TO
STICK TOGETHER WHILE ON THREE
SEPARATE TRIBES RIGHT NOW COULD
BE FOOLISH.
 I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO STICK TOGETHER, BUT YOU CAN'T
BE UNAWARE OF THE SITUATION.
GEN-X IS DOWN NUMBERS, AND WE DO
NEED MILLENNIALS TO HELP GOING
FORWARD.
 Jeff: BUT DID YOU FEEL
MICHELLE OR ZEKE TRYING TO WORK
DAVID, CeCe AND YOURSELF?
 YOU BET.
YOU BET.
THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN UP, THAT'S
FOR SURE.
AND I TALKED A LOT WITH ZEKE.
WE'RE BETH OKLAHOMA BOYS.
HE'S A BIG SOONER FAN, AND, OF
COURSE, I PLAYED.
I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH
ZEKE, WHICH MAY SURPRISE PEOPLE,
THE BIG COUNTRY BOY AND THE NEW
YORK KID.
 Christa: CeCe, WHAT
LEVEL OF CONCERN DO YOU HAVE
WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF YOUR THREE
GEN-XERS, CHRIS, TALKING WITH
ZEKE?
 IT DEFINITELY RAISES
CONCERNS.
YOU KNOW, GOING FORWARD, CHRIS
MAY BE WILLING TO VOTE OUT A
GEN-X TO SAVE ZEKE.
 Jeff: CHRIS, IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHEN DOES
THE GAME PLAY BEGIN?
 THE LAST TWO TRIBALS I'VE
BEEN TO, I'VE BEEN BLIND SIDED,
SO THIS VOTE TONIGHT IS A CHANCE
FOR US TO BUILD BACK A REALLY
STRONG BOND AND BE REALLY CLOSE.
 Jeff: DAVID, HAS THERE BEEN
TALK ABOUT PREVIOUS TRIBALS AND
WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
HAPPENED?
 YES, THERE HAS BEEN.
I DO UNDERSTAND CHRIS'S CONCERNS
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN
TRUST ME, AND WE ACTUALLY TALKED
ABOUT THAT TODAY.
TRUST IS PARAMOUNT TONIGHT, AND
I KEEP FINDING MYSELF IN THE
POSITION OF HAVING TO PROVE MY
LOYALTY, AND I OWE HIM THAT, AND
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO DO THAT.
 Jeff: CHRIS, THE OTHER
SPECIFIC THING DAVID SAID WAS
THAT HE NEEDS THE PROVE HIS
TRUST.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
 YES, DAVID, HE GOT ME A
COUPLE TIMES, AND I DON'T LIKE
TO BE RECKLESS OR ANYTHING, BUT
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO TAKE A
RISK, AND I'M TAKING A RISK ON
DAVID TONIGHT, BUT I
SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIM, IF YOU DO
IT AGAIN, I BETTER BE SITTING
RIGHT UP THERE TONIGHT.
 I THINK YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING
TO CHOKE ME.
 I MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT, TOO,
BUT I WAS KIDDING ON THAT.
 Jeff: MICHELLE, THAT IS THE
BEST THING YOU CAN HOPE TO HEAR
IS THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS IN
THAT GROUP.
 YES.
I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE HOW THERE
COULD BE VERY MUCH TRUST THERE.
ESPECIALLY CONTINUING FORWARD.
I JUST WONDER WHY WOULD YOU WANT
THE TRY TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO
HAS BLIND SIDED YOU TWICE.
 Jeff: WHO DO YOU THINK
SHOULD BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 I THINK I WOULD PUT OUT
DAVID.
 THIS IS FUN.
 Jeff: DAVID, IT CAN'T
SURPRISE YOU, THOUGH.
IF YOU'RE SITTING IN THEIR SEAT,
YOU GOT TO GET THAT VOTE OFF
YOUR SHOULDER ON TO SOMEBODY
ELSE'S.
 UNDERSTANDABLY, BUT I THINK
IF THE GEN-X THREE SITTING HERE
TONIGHT ARE TRULY UNITED, WE
HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
 Jeff: OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
CeCe, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE MICHELLE.
CeCe.
ONE VOTE MICHELLE, ONE VOTE
CeCe.
CeCe.
THAT'S TWO VOTES CeCe, ONE
VOTE MICHELLE.
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT,
CeCe.
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
CeCe, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: WELL, IF THERE'S ONE
THING THIS GROUP OF FOUR CAN
TAKE COMFORT IN, IT'S KNOWING
YOU CAN TRUST EACH OTHER,
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE THE
ONE BEING LIED TO.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," FIGGY LETS HER GUARD
DOWN.
 TAYLOR AND I KIND OF HAVE A
THING.
 YOU THINK?
 IT'S OBVIOUS.
 Jeff: WHILE A CHALLENGE
LEAVES THE SURVIVORS SPINNING.

SUNDAY GETTING DIZZY NOW.
MEDICAL.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET ME
DIE.
 IT'S INSANE.
 I WAS BLIND SIDED.
MY TWO FELLOW GEN-XERS VOTED
AGAINST ME, AND GOING FORWARD
THEY'RE GOING THE LOSE.
I THINK IT WAS THE DUMBEST
MISTAKE THEY MADE.
I FEEL BETRAYED, BUT I PLAYED AS
HARD AS I COULD.
I STRATEGIZED.
I SNUCK IN, AND I ABSOLUTELY
BELIEVE MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE
VERY PROUD HOW FAR I CAME IN THE
GAME AND THAT I DID MY BEST.
