         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE IKA BULA
TRIBE, SUNDAY AND BRET WERE
OUTNUMBERED BY THE MILLENNIALS.
 SEE YOU LATER, GE GEN-XERS.
 Jeff: AND ZEKE WAS ZRTING
TO GROW CLOSER TO THE GEN-XERS.
 IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR MEé
TRIBE.
 Jeff: ADAM HAD TO DECIDE
WHETHER TO VOTE WITH THE
MILLENNIAL COUPLE OR TO TRUST
THE GEN-XERS.
 I WOULD NEVER PUT YOU NAME
DOWN.
 THE QUESTION IS WHICH SIDE IS
GOING TO BE BETTER FOR MY FUTURE
IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ADAM AND THE GEN-XERSçó VOTED OU








TAYLOR'S GIRLFRIEND.ñr
FIGGY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, TAY.
 Jeff: 14 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
GRAND PLAN OF HOW YOU WANT TO DO
THIS IN THE FUTURE.
 OH, MY GOSH, TRIBAL SUCKED,
TO THE MAX.
I CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE LIKE
I COULD FIGS.
JUST THE COMFORT OF HAVING HER
AROUND, THE SMILES, THE HIGH
SPIRIT IN CAMP.
FOR ME FIGS WAS THE LIGHT, AND
CAMP IS JUST KIND OF GRAY RIGHT
NOW.
 IT WAS A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION
FOR ME.
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS LEAST
BEST, AND MAYBE I MESSED UP.








 BUT THAT AFFECTS ME, AS WELL.
 OF COURSE IT DOES.
OF COURSE IT DOES.
YEAH, I SCREWED YOU.
I LIED TO YOU, AND I SCREWED
YOU.
100%.
 YEAH.
 I ADMIT THAT.
I FEEL BADLY THAT I ENDED THEIR
ISLAND ROMANCE, BUT I DID WHAT I
NEEDED TO DO.
I PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION WHERE
I CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH A GROUP
OF GEN X-ERS AND FIGGY WAS
ULTIMATELY THE SACRIFICE THAT
HAD TO HAPPEN.
 YOU ARE NOW IN A WORST
POSITION THAN YOU WERE BEFORE.
 YEP, YEAH.
 AND THAT'S MY FAULT.
AND I ADMIT THAT.
ñr I'M BEYONDñr PISSED AT ADAM
THIS IS A TOTAL GAME OF REVENGE.
I'LL KEEP MY COOL FORÑi NOW, BUT
WHEN IT COMESñrçó TIME, I WILL
DESTROY YOU.
 MAKE A DECISION?
 COOKING AS ALWAYS.
 IT'S EASY WHEN IT'S HOT.
 SITTING ON THE BEACH WITH THE
VANUA TRIBE, I'M THINKING, IF WE
LOSE NEXT IMMUNITY, MICHELLE IS
ABSOLUTELY WHO WE WOULD VOTE OUT
OF THIS GAME, BUT I WOULD NOT
PUT IT PAST CHRIS TO TRY THE
PULL FAST ONE ANDçó VOTE ME OUT
INSTEAD OF MICHELLE, BUT I FEEL
LIKE I DO HAVE A TIGHTER BOND
THAN I DO WITH CHRIS, AND
FRANKLY I THINK WE'RE CUT FROM
THE SAME CLOTH.
I'M A PARANOID GUY.
LET ME KNOW IF ANYBODY IS COMING
UP BEHINDÑi ME.
I'M THINKING I COULD SHOW HIM MY
IDOL.
THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRUST.
I HATE SHARING KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
AN IDOL.
IT'S A VERY RISKY MOVE OR IT'S A
GREAT MOVE.
YOU JUST REALLY NEVER KNOW.
ZEKE, I TRUST YOU A LOT.
 I TRUST YOU, TOO.
 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TELL ANYBODY ELSE.
 YOU HAVE AN IDOL?
 I FOUND IT THE VERY NEXT DAY.
 THAT'S VERY GOOD.
GREAT.
 PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THAT WITH
ANYONE.
 IT DOESN'T BEHOOVE ME.
 I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH
YOU.
THAT'S MY TRUTH.
 DAVID TOLD ME THAT HE HAD A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
WHICH I WAS JUST DELIGHTED TO
HEAR.
RIGHT?
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, IT'S GOOD
THAT A PERSON YOU'RE VERY CLOSE
TO HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 YOU'RE LITERALLY THE ONLY
PERSON IN THIS GAME OTHER THAN
MYSELF THAT KNOWS I HAVE THE
IDOL.
 DUDE, YOUR SECRET IS SAFE
WITH ME.
I THINK DAVID AND I COULD HAVE A
FUTURE IN THIS GAME TOGETHER.
HE'S PUT HIS LIFE IN MY HAND,
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE VERY, VERY
GOOD CARE OF HIS LIFE.
FOR THE TIME BEING.
FOR THE TIME BEING.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 WOW.
 Jeff: VANUA AND IKA BULA
GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE
NEW TAKALI TRIBE.
FIGGY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 WOW.
 WOW.
 FIGGY.
 FIGS.
 Jeff: SO MANY DIFFERENT
REACTIONS.
MICHAELA, AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, YOU LOOKED AT THIS
TRIBE AND YOU SAID, IF YOU CAN'T
FIGURE IT OUT WITH THREE
MILLENNIALS, THAT'S DOWN TO YOU.
 IT'S BEEN BEEN TIME FOR FIGGY
TO GO HOME FOR A WHILE, SO BYE,
PI -- FELICIA.
 Jeff: WOW.
TAYLOR, SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT?
 NO COMMENT.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER TO
UNWINDING AND RELEASE THREE
BALLS.
YOU'LL THEN SHOOT THE BALLS INTO
A BASKET AND PUSH THEM THROUGH A
ROPE TUNNEL.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BALLS,
YOU'LL ATTEMPT TO LAND THEM ON A
PERCH.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST TRIBE TO
FINISH, YOU WILL HAVE A CHEF
COME TO YOUR CAMP AND COOK FOR
YOU.
YOU WILL SIT BACK AND ENJOY
CHICKEN, GARLIC SHRIMP, SOME
SALAD, AND FINISH ITçó OFF WITH
CHEESECAKE.
 OH.
 GOD.ñr
 NO WAY.
 Jeff: SECOND TRIBE TO
FINISH, KEBABS AND YOU GOT TO
COOK IT YOURSELF,çó BUT IT WILL
TASTE GOOD.
THIRD TRIBEÑi TO FINISH, NOTHING
IKA BULA, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA
MEMBERS.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SIT OUT IN
THIS CHALLENGE?çó
 BRET AND I ARE GOINGÑi TO SIT

CANNOT STAND ON THE STRUCTURE.
EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.

BALL.
JAY NOW STANDING ON THE
SHOULDERS OF HIS TRIBE MATES,
AND IT IS WORKING.Ñi
ADAM NOW GETTING SOME MOMENTUM
GOING.
 ALL RIGHT.
HERE.
 Jeff: GOT TO SPIN IT OVER.
IT TAKES SOME STRENGTH TO GET
THAT THING MOVING.
 UNDERNEATH, UNDERNEATH.
PUSH, PUSH.
 Jeff:çó ZEKE STRUGGLING.
ZEKE TAKES A BIG FALL.
Z
NOW.
DAVID GOING UP.
JAY IS
TAKALI RELEASES.
DAVID STRUGGLING JUST AS MUCH AS
ZEKE.
QUICKLY FALLING BEHIND IN THIS
CHALLENGE.Ñi

 Jeff: NOW YOU HAVE TO UK

THERE YOU GO, START UNTYING.

THE ROPES.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT AGAIN UNTIL THAT
BALL IS THROUGH THE NET.
IKA BULA STILL WORKING ONñr THEI
FIRST.
CHRIS SHOOTING FOR VANUA.
THEY ARE CLOSING THAT GAP.
IT IS NOW ZEKE AND M[cJELLE
WORKING TO RELEASE THAT BALL.
JAY SCORES.
IT IS NOW WILL AND HANNAH TRYING
TO MANEUVER THAT BALL.

A LOT OF TIME VERY QUICKLY.

ZEKE AND MICHELLE HAVE GOT THIS

WHAT DID M[cJELLE AND ZEKE
FIGURE OUT THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN,
BECAUSE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
IN THIS CHALLENGE.
CHRIS GOING TO SHOOT FOR VANUA.
HE'S GOT TO LAND ALLñr THREE BAL
ON TOP OF THE PERCH TO WIN.
IKA BULA STILL WORKING WITH THE

CHRIS LANDS HIS FIRST ONE FOR
VANUA.
THERE IT IS.
GO, GO, TAKALI.

IT'S MICHAELA SHOOTING FOR IKA
BULA.
KEN TRYING THE LAND THAT SECOND.
 NICE JOB, MICHAELA.
 Jeff: MICHAELA TRYING TO
MAKE UP A HUGE LOSS OF TIME.
MICHAELA HAS FIRST AND NOW WE
ARE TIED.
IT WOULD BE A HUGE COMEBACK FROM
IKA BULA TO PULL THIS OUT AND
WIN THE KEBABS.
KEN LANDS THE SECOND FOR TAKALI.
HE'S GONE ONE LEFT.
 DON'T HIT THE OTHER ONE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
 Jeff: MICHAELA LANDS THE
SECOND.
WE ARE TIED.
THIS IS IT.
ONE BALL LEFT.

A GOOD AFTERNOON.
HOPEFULLY YOU GOT SOME FIRE AND
YOU CAN COOK THEM UP.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TAKALI,
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 TO COME FROM AHEAD TO BEHIND
TO AHEAD AGAIN AND GET THAT
SECOND PLACE, ON THE ONE HAND I
WAS HAPPY BECAUSE WE GOT
SKEWERS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS WHEN I HELP
THE TEAM WIN BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT PEOPLEÑi THINKING THAT I'M
THE ONE TO BEAT.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
 WALKING INTO CAMP AFTER
WINNING REWARD AND SEEING THE
CHEF WITH HIS BARBECUE, HIS
GRILL AND ALL HIS FIXINGS, IT
WAS SUCH A RELIEF.
WOW.
OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
 JEFF
COMPLETELY UNDERSOLD IT.
THIS IS FOOD I WOULD TALK ABOUT
IN A RESTAURANT IN L.A.
 I'M NOT STOPPING.
 OH, BOY.
 THIS GAME REQUIRES YOU TO
CHANGE AND ADAPT.
I SPENT MOST OF MY YOUTH ON A
DIET, SO I ALWAYS AM WATCHING
WHAT I EAT, BUT OUT HERE I PILE
FOOD ON TO MY PLATE.
I FUNNEL IT DIRECTLY INTO MY
MOUTH, AND I JUST KEPT GOING,
BECAUSE THE MORE CALORIES I CAN
EAT NOW, THE LONGER IT'S GOING
TO BENEFIT ME.
AND BECAUSE OF MY INNER FAT KID,
I COULD BINGE, BABY.
 I HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK.
I'VE NEVER EATEN THAT MUCH FOOD
THAT FAST IN MY LIFE.
 THE THREE GUYS TURN ENTERED A
BUNCH OF ANIMALS AN WE'RE JUST
SCRAPING FOOD OFF THE PLATE.
MICHELLE WAS EATING WITH HER
KNIFE AND FORK LIKE A HUMAN.
[FARTING]
GAS IS JUST TAKING AWAY SPACE
FOR FOOD.
[BURPING]
 BY THE END OF THE MEAL, ALL
I'M HEARING IS BODILY FUNCTIONS
AND NOISES COMING FROM THE GUYS
SITTING NEXT TO ME.
IT GOT GROSS AND ANNOYING.
I DON'T EAT LIKE THAT.
MY MOM TAUGHT MEñr MANNERS, BUT
NOW I AM A LITTLEÑi NERVOUS
BECAUSE ME BEING THE ONLY GIRL,
I COULD BE AN EASY VOTE, BUT I'M
NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHO I AM FOR
THE GAME.
 EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY PART
OF OUR DAILY LIVES IS AFFECTED
BY POLICY, AND THAT POLICY IS
CREATED BY OFFICIALS THAT WE
ELECT OR DON'T ELECT.
 YEAH.
 I'VE NOTICED THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE IN MY GENERATION DON'T
CARE.
 I HATE TALKING ABOUT
POLITICS.
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT, ONE
GROUP OF PEOPLE IS NQ
TO BE HAPPY.
I'M NOT SO CONCERNED WITH WHO IS
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT.
I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT TO PUT
MY HOPE IN POLITICS.
 I DO THINK MY GENERATION IS
GOING TO CHANGE THINGS SO
DRASTICALLY, JUST THINGS THAT
WE'VE REALIZED THAT ARE NOT OF
USE ANYMORE, LIKE THE ELECTORAL
VOTE.
 TAYLOR IS CLASSIC MILLENNIAL.
HE'S SO HONEST WITH HIS ANSWERS.
HE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS SOUND THEÑi
BRIGHTEST, BUT YOU LIKE HIM JUST
THE SAME BECAUSE HE'LL GIVE YOU
THE ANSWER THAT IS TRULY THE
ANSWER.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, ADAM
PROMISED YOU AND FIGGY HE'LL
NEVER WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN, AND
THEN HE WROTE FIG YES'S NAME
DOWN.
Ñi 100%.
SO I KNOW YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU
GOT TO DO, BUT COME MERGE, LIKE
I HAVEñr NO ALLEGIANCE AND I WOU
SHAKE YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOWçó AND
SAY THAT I WON'T VOTE YOUR NAME
DOWN.
I WON'T WRITE IT DOWN.
 THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
 I'LL NEVER BE WRITING DOWN
THE NAMEÑi JESSICA, AN I'LL NEVE
BE WRITING DOWN THE NAME KEN.
 THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
THAT MEANS A LOT.
 WE HAVE TAYLOR WHO WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND STRATEGY IF YOU TRIED
TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM, SO MAYBE
WHAT HE TELLS US IS A LITTLE
MORE RELIABLE THAN WHAT WE'RE
GETTING FROM ADAM, WHO IS MORE
STRATEGIC.
SO KEN AND I ARE JUST TAKING IN
ALL THE INFORMATION WE'RE BEING
PROVIDED.
IF WE DON'T WIN, IT'S GOING TO
BE A HUGE DECISION, AND WE NEED
TO MAKE THE RIGHT ONE.
TO MAKE THE RIGHT ONE.
THE 20th DAY, FOLKS.
 THE 20th DAY.
 OVER THE HUMP.
 MAN THOSE BUPGS WERE INSANE
LAST NIGHT.
 AWFUL, AWFUL.
 I JUST TOLD MYSELF, MICHAELA,
YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING CRAWLING
ON YOU.
IT'S YOUR IMAGINATION.
IT'S JUST A FLY BUZZING, BUT HE
DOESN'T BITE.
LET HIM BUZZ, MICHAELA.
LET HIM BUZZ.
I'VE BEEN ON THIS ISLAND 20
DAYS.
I'M HALF-WAY THROUGH, BUT I'M A
STRONGñr GIRL, PROBABLY THEÑi
STRONGEST GIRL ON THIS TRIBE.
THAT ISSUE IS IN YOUR MIND,ñr
GIRL.
I KNOW I'M A PRETTY INTENSE
PERSON.
STEVE JOBS WAS PRETTY INTENSE.
MICHAEL JORDAN IS PRETTY
INTENSE.
IT'S LIKE MICHAELA BRADSHAW IS
PRETTY INTENSE.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US WINNERS, SO
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, YOU
CAN'T HANDLE MY HEAT, GET OUT OF
THE KITCHEN.
 EXCELLENT DAY.
 WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP
OURSELVES UNITED SOçó WE CAN KEE
WINNING.
OF COURSE THIS IS ALL SORT OF A
MIRAGE, BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR
MILLENNIALS AND TWO GEN XERS.
SUNDAY IS SO SWEET.
 I2hCVE ONE THAWNT CALLS ME
SUNNY.
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE ALLOW.
 BUT BRET FEELS SUSPICIOUS TO
ME.
WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?
 I'Mñr A FUNERAL DIRECTOR.Ñi
I RUN THE FUNERALS AND TRY THE
MAKE THE FAMILIES AS COMFORTABLE
AS POSSIBLE.
 I WANT THE CAST DOUBT ABOUT
BRET BECAUSE I THINK HE'S LYING
ABOUT HIS FUNERAL DIRECTING.
 I HELP THEM PICK OUT A CASKET
AND ALL THAT STUFF.
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORW
Ñi ISN'T IT EMOTIONAL?
 YEAH, BUT LIKE ANYTHING, YOU
GET USED TO IT.
IT'S KIND OF MORBID.
 SO I'M SITTING THERE MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS, SO HANNAH
STARTS ASKING ME ABOUT THE
FUNERAL HOME BUSINESS.
 ONE FAMILY AT A TIME, HOW
DOES IT WORK?
 YOU MAKE APPOINTMENTS AND SIT
DOWN AND TALK ABOUT FUNERALS AND
STUFF LIKE THAT.
I HATE TO LIE TO HER, BUT I KNOW
THE HISTORY OF SURVIVOR.
POLICE OFFICERS DON'T GENERALLY
DO WELL.
SO I'M GOING TO STICK TO MY
GUNS.
 CAN I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
BRET?
I'M LIKE 70% SURE HE'S A COP.
I GREW UP IN BOSTON.
I'M LIKE PRETTY SURE HE'S A COP.
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE JUST
INTERROGATED A COP.
BRET TALKS LIKE A COP, WALKS
LIKE A COP, BUT MORE THAN THAT
FOR ME, IT'S ABOUT MAKING THE
OTHER THREE MILLENNIALS BE
SKETCHED OUT BY THESE TWO REALLY
SWEET GEN XERS.
I WANT THE FOUR OF US TO STAY
TIGHT.
I FEEL LIKE IF IT CAME DOWN TO A
VOTE AND I WAS LIKE, HEY, DUDE,
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE A COP,
WHERE MY VOTE IS GOING IS ALL
ABOUT TRUST AND HONESTY...
 IF HE IS A COP, LET HIM
REVEAL THAT.
DON'T FORHIS HAND OR ELSE HE'LL
GET REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.
 A FUNERAL IS SO SPECIFIC THAT
YOU WOULD NEVER THINK TO
QUESTION IT.
THAT'S THE THING.
 YEAH.
I GREW UP IN BOSTON, THOUGH.
HE SOUNDS LIKE EVERY COP I'VE
EVER MET.
IS THAT DUMB?
 I THINK HE'S A COP, TOO.
 BRET SAYS HE'S A FUNERAL
DIRECTOR, BUT THE THING, IS I
KNOW FLORIDA COPS, AND HONESTLY,
IF YOU TOOK AWAY HIS ACCENT, PUT
HIM IN A UNIFORM, PUT HIM IN
FLORIDA, HE WOULD BE SOMEONE
THAT I'M RUNNING AWAY FROM EVERY
TIME I START A BONFIRE ON THE
BEACH.
 KEEP DOING YOUR LITTLE
INVESTIGATION, WHAT DO YOU DO
EXACTLY.
 HE'S TOO FUNNY AND TOO LIVELY
TO BE A FUNERAL DIRECTOR, AND IT
MATTERS IF HE'S A COP BECAUSE
HE'S ALREADY LYING IN MY FACE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.Ñi
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
YOU NOVI THE TAKE THEM BACK.
 I KNOW.
 Jeff: THANK YOU DAVI"v

ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE TO THROW COCONUTS
INTO A NET.
ONCE YOUR NET IS HEAVY ENOUGH, A
FLAG WILL DROP REVEALING
NUMBERS.
THOSE NUMBERS WILL RELEASE A
KEY.
THAT KEY WILL UNLOCK A
SLINGSHOT.çó
YOU WILL THEN FIRE SAPPED BAGS
ATTEMPTING TO KNOCK DOWN
TARGETS.
FIRST TWO TRIBESÑi TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHEREçó
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SEVENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

 OKAY, GO.

RIGHT.
BRET FIRES.
JUST SHORT.
KEN NOW FIRING.
JUST MISSES.
MICHELLE TRYING ANOTHER COMBO.

CHRIS HITS ANOTHER.
MICHAELA DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE THE LOSE WITH THIS TRIBE.
IT WOULD BE A BAD TIME TO FIND
OUT.xD
BIG FAIL.
CHRIS FOR THE WIN SENDING IKA
BULA TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 YOU GOT IT, CHRIS.
 Jeff: CHRIS GOING DEEP AND
HE DOES IT.
VANUA WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING IKA
BULA TO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
TAKALI, NICELY DONE.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THIS
TRIBE.
VANUA, NICE JOB.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM VANUA.
TAKALI, CONGRATULATION, ENJOY
THE NIGHT OFF.
THIS TRIBE STAYS INTACT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: VANUA, NICE COME FROM
BEHIND.4&
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, YOU'RE GOING
TO GO BACK TO CAMP.
WILL IT BE SECONDS OR MINUTES
BEFORE THE PARANOIA SETS IN AND
YOU GUYS START SCRAMBLING?
 I'M GOING THE SAY MINUTES
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO TRY
THE PLAY IT COOL, AND THEN
WITHIN MINUTES WE TURN ON THE
PARANOIA BUTTON.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IKA BULA, TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SEVENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 THE MILLENNIALS HAVE TO.
COME TOGETHER AND DECIDE IF IT'S
BRET AND SUNDAY, BUT CONSIDERING
BRET KEEPS LYING, SORRY, BRET,
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO
HOME.
 FOR US TO LOSE FELT LIKE
GETTING PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH.
WE ACTUALLY ALL SAT IN SILENCE
FOR LIKE AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR
BECAUSE WE GENUINELY LIKE EACH
OTHER.
BRET AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER,
AND IT WAS LIKE, CRAP, IT'S ONE
OF US.
I JUST HAD TO HOLD BACK TEARS
BECAUSE I'M IN THE USED TO BEING
IN A POSITION WHERE OTHER PEOPLE
ARE DECIDING MY FATE, BUT THAT'S
"SURVIVOR."
WE BOTH KNOW IT.
SORRY.
 YOU HAVE TO PUT MY NAME AND
YOU HAVE TO -- I HAVE TO PUT
YOUR NAME, UNLESS WE CAN COME UP
WITH ANOTHER PLAN.
 ME AND SUNDAY SAID WE WILL
NOT RIGHT OUR NAME DOWN, BUT
TONIGHT WE HAVE TO BREAK THAT
PROMISE.
SHE AGREED.
IT SUCKS, BECAUSE IF YOU VOTE
FOR ANYONE ELSE, THEY'RE GOING
TO GUN FOR YOU.
 WE HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY.
I HATE IT.
 ME TOO.
 IT STINKS NOT TO HAVE YOUR
FATE IN YOUR OWN HAND, BUT
THAT'S THIS GAME.
THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN
YOU'RE AT THE WHIM OF EVERYONE
YOU'RE ON THE ISLAND WITH, BUT
IT IS "SURVIVOR" AND YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
 SO I PLAYED OUT A SCENARIO IN
MY MIND.
THIS IS OUR FINAL FOUR.
THESE ARE THE OTHER TRIBES.
TWO MILLENNIALS, TWO GEN XERS,
AND THEN THIS IS THE PERSON THAT
SURVIVED THE VOTE.
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU WHY IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHO WE PICK.
WE STILL GOT FOUR VOTES.
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE GO HOME, A
GEN XER AND WE'RE BACK LIKE
THIS.
I PULLED THE MILLENNIALS
TOGETHER.
AND I USED SOME ROCKS TO LAY OUT
A PLAN, JUST SHOWING IT DOESN'T
MATTER REALLY WHO STAYS AND WHO
GOES IF WE PLAY THESE NUMBERS
RIGHT.
 BRET MIGHT BE A COP.
 HE MIGHT BE A COP.
 WE COULD SPLIT THE VOTES
TONIGHT IN CASE THERE IS AN IDOL
PLAYED.
 SO WE'LL SPLIT THE VOTES AND
ALL BRET THE SECOND TIME IN
 COOL.
 THIS SPLIT-VOTE PLAN IS JUST
IN CASE AN IDOL IS PLAYED.
SO THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO VOTE
FOR BRET.
THE BOYS WILL VOTE FOR SUNDAY.
THAT WOULD MAKE IT A TIE.
AND THEN WE'LL REVOTE AND
HOPEFULLY VOTE FOR BRET.
 MICHAELA'S GOT SEASHELLS LIKE
A FOOTBALL PLAY.
SHE'S LIKE, OKAY, POST-MERGE
WE'RE ELIMINATING THIS PERSON,
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE, THERE WILL
BE FOUR SEASHELLS LEFT, WHICH IS
US, AND MICHAELA'S A SMART GIRL.
SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL IS NOTHING TO
BE AFRAID OF.
YOU WANT TO GO THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN
THE GAME.
THIS IS THE REASON I LIKE THIS
TRIBE, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU
ALL ARE THREE PEOPLE I CAN TRUST
IN THE GAME.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE ARE
THREE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS GAME
I CAN TRUST.
 SHE IS A HUGE THREAT.
SHE'S GOOD AT COMPETITION, SHE'S
A SMART CHICK, SO I HAVE THIS
EPIPHANY OF SAYING, BOOP,
MICHAELA SHOULD GO HOME, BEFORE
THE MERGE.
 I START THINKING ABOUT IT.
MAYBE WE SHOULD SEND MICHAELA
HOME.
SHE IS FRICKEN SMART.
SHE'S BREAKING IT DOWN PERSON BY
PERSON.
 SHE'S LIKE, WE'LL GET RID OF
THIS PERSON AND THAT PERSON,
LIKE TWO GEN XERS AND ONE
MILLENNIAL.
I'M LIKE, DUDE, YOU'RE THINKING
WAY TOO FAR AHEAD.
 MICHAELA IS SO INTELLIGENT.
EVERY TIME I HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH HER ABOUT THIS GAME, SHE
THINKS ABOUT IT METHODICALLY.
I NEED TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT
TIME TO VOTE HER OUT, BECAUSE I
REALLY LIKE MICHAELA, SHE'S A
GREAT, POSITIVE VIBE TO HAVE
AROUND CAMP, AND I DON'T THINK
ANY OF US WANT TO SEE HER GO.
 I'M PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.
SHE KNOWS YOU HAVE THE IDOL.
THAT'S SCARY, TOO.
YOU HAVE A POINT.
MAYBE WE'LL VOTE FOR MICHAELA.
 IF WE TELL HANNAH, SHE'LL
FREAK OUT.
IF WE DON'T TELL HANNAH, SHE'LL
FREAK OUT LATER.
 I'D RATHER NOT TELL HER.
I TRUST MICHAELA.
SHE HASN'T LIED.
MICHAELA'S ONLY ALLIANCE IS US.
YOU WANT TO VOTE TONIGHT?
 I'M NERVOUS.
MICHAELA IS A GREAT ALLIANCE,
AND I HAVE BEEN WITH HER SINCE
DAY ONE.
AND I STILL DON'T TRUST BRET.
IT'S CRAZY WHEN YOU MAKE A BIG
MOVE BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING, IS
THIS THE RIGHT RODGE CAL THING
TO DO?
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT A JOKE.
THIS DECISION TONIGHT COULD
HONESTLY MOLD THE REST OF MY
GAME EITHER FOR A WIN OR FOR A
LOSS.
I'M FREAKING OUT.
 Jeff: SO IKA BULA, FIRST
TIME AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, BOTH THE
OTHER TRIBES HAVE BEEN HERE, AND
IN METH CASES THE MAJORITY VOTED
OUT ONE OF THEIR OWN.
MICHAELA, SEEING THAT, WHERE IS
YOUR LEVEL OF TRUST WITH THE
MILLENNIALS?
 MY THOUGHTS TONIGHT ARE BASED
ON THE PEOPLE THAT I'M WITH.
THE MAJORITIES IN THE OTHER TWO
TRIBES ARE FULL OF SKETCHY
PEOPLE, AND SKETCHY PEOPLE CAN'T
BE RELIED ON, BUT THE NICE THING
ABOUT BEING ON IKA BULA IS ALL
SIX OF US ARE PRETTY TRUSTWORTHY
PEOPLE.
 Jeff: JAY, SURPRISE YOU THE
OTHER TRIBALS HAVE GONE THE WAY
THEY HAVE WITH THE MAJORITY
TAKING OUT ONE OF THEIR OWN?
 YEAH, FOR SURE.
SEEING THAT MILLENNIALS TOOK OUT
MILLENNIALS, WE'RE WONDERING,
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING OR EVEN
GEN X HAD THE MAJORITY AND AND T
DID THE SAME THING.
SUNDAY, AT THE CHALLENGE, YOU
SAID, HOW LONG BEFORE THE
SCRAMBLING STARTS.
YOU SAID ABOUT TWO MINUTES.
WERE YOU CLOSE?
 ACTUALLY NO.
WE SAT ON ONE LOG LINED UP
TOGETHER NOT SAYING A SINGLE
WORD.
 Jeff: EVEN MICHAELA?
 EVEN MICHAELA.
 Jeff: SO MICHAELA, THE SIX
OF YOU ARE SITTING ON A LOG.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
 HOW IT SUCKS THAT THE IKA
BULA SIX ARE FORCED TO DROP DOWN
TO FIVE.
LIKE WE GENUINELY LIKE EACH
OTHER.
THIS IS BRET AND MAMA SUNDAY.
WE'RE TIGHT.
WE WOULD HAVE TOOK OVER THIS
WHOLE GAME IF YOU LET US ALL GO
TO THE MERGE.
 Jeff: IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT,
ISN'T IT?
 YOU DID IT.
WE DIDN'T ASK FOR SLINGSHOTS.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, DOES IT WORK
AGAINST YOU THAT THE FOUR
MILLENNIALS MIGHT SAY, IT'S NOT
THAT WE DON'T TRUST SUNDAY OR
BRET, IT'S THAT THEY KNOW OTHER
PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW.
WITH THESE FOUR, I KNOW I CAN
TRUST THEM.
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE DAY
ONE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
BRET AND I ARE WELL AWARE WE ARE
ON THE OUTS.
THEY'VE DIDN'T A FABULOUS JOB
TRYING TO MAKE US NOT FEEL ON
THE OUTS, BUT IT IS 4-2.
 Jeff: BRET, IF THERE'S ANY
GOOD NEWS, IT'S THAT THE OTHER
TWO TRIBES HAVE THE MAJORITY AND
THEY VOTED OUT ONE OF THEIR OWN,
SO YOU GOT TO BE THINKING, I
COULD MAKE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN
TONIGHT.
 HEY, I'M GAME FOR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, JEFF.
LET'S GET IT GOING.
BUT I'M... THEY KNOW WHO I AM.
THEY KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON I
AM, AND THEY KNOW I'M BEING
GENERAL UNIWITH THEM.
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN
HELP ME, LET'S DO IT.
 Jeff: WILL, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT HOW THE GAME HAS EVOLVED
GOING BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE
BORN, AS IMPORTANT AS TRUST IS,
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT GAME PLAY
HAS JUST SURPASSED IT AND IT
REALLY IS TEMPORARY ALLIANCES
AND VOTING BLOCS AND I DON'T
MIND BLIND SIDING ANYBODY AT ANY
TIME BECAUSE I'M PLAYING
MAVERICK GAME?
 THE GAME YOU DESCRIBED IS
DANGEROUS.
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IF YOU'RE
PLAYING CRAZY, GUNS-ABLAZING
LIKE THAT.
AND IN A GAME WHERE TRUST IS A
RARE COMMODITY, ANY TIME YOU CAN
FIND THAT WITH ANYBODY, YOU
LATCH ON THE IT, BECAUSE THAT
MIGHT BE WHAT WILL GET YOU TO
THE END OF THIS GAME.
 Jeff: SO JAY, DOES IT COME
DOWN TO A GUT IF YOU LOOK AT
BRET VERSUS SUNDAY IN
 YEAH, YOU GOT TO FOLLOW YOUR
GUT.
SO IF YOUR GUT IS TELLING YOU
ONE THING, JUST GO WITH IT, MAN.
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU GOT
HONESTLY.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, WHAT DOES
IT COME DOWN TO FOR YOU?
 THE MERGE HAS TO COME SOON.
IT JUST COMES DOWN TO WHO DO WE
THINK CAN MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO
FIVE WITH US.
 Jeff: SO WILL, PREDICT THE
FUTURE.
AFTER TONIGHT'S VOTE, YOU GO
BACK TO CAMP, WHAT KIND OF TRIBE
WILL YOU HAVE?
 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
FIVE STRONG, TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: JAY, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT?
WILL TONIGHT'S VOTE MAKE THIS
TRIBE STRONGER?
 IF I COULD TELL THE FUTURE,
JEFF, I THINK SO, BECAUSE THEN
THE BONDS WILL ONLY GROW FROM
THAT POINT FORWARD.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, AFTER
TONIGHT'S VOTE, IS THIS TRIBE
BROKEN OR STRONGER?
 DEFINITELY STRONGER, BUT I
HOPE THAT TONIGHT NO ONE FEELS
AT THE BOTTOM.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T PLAN
FOR, BUT IT'S A PART OF THE GAME
 WHO WOULD FEEL AT THE BOTTOM?
WHICHEVER ONE OF THESE GREAT
PEOPLE HERE THAT DOESN'T GO
HOME.
BUT THAT'S NO WHAT I WANT.
 Jeff: SO BASED ON WHAT I'M
HEARING, WE HAVE A GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO TRULY TRUST EACH
OTHER OR SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TO
GET BLIND SIDED.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
HANNAH, YOU'RE UP.
 I WISH I COULD HAVE GONE
FURTHER WITH YOU.
 I WISH I COULD HAVE GONE
FURTHER WITH YOU.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE BRET.
BRET.
TWO VOTES BRET.
MICHAELA.
TWO VETS BRET, ONE VOTE
MICHAELA.
MICHAELA.
TWO VOTES BRET, TWO VOTES
MICHAELA.
MICHAELA.
 WHAT?
 Jeff: THAT'S THREE VOTES
MICHAELA, TWO VOTES BRET, ONE
VOTE LEFT.
 DID YOU DO THAT?
 I DID NOT DO THAT.
 Jeff: SEVENTH PERSON VOTED
OUT, MICHAELA.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 JAY.
DAMN, JAY.
YOU JUST...
 WHAT?
WHAT?
 Jeff: MICHAELA, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
 I FEEL LIKE AN ASS.
DAMN, JAY.
 Jeff: WELL, IT WAS GOING TO
BE TRUST OR BLINDSIDE.
IT TURNS OUT THE ONE WHO WAS
PREACHING TRUST THE MOST IS THE
ONE WHO WAS BLIND SIDED.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE MERGE HAS
ARRIVED.
 I NOW IS WHEN YOU START
DESTROYING HOPES AND DREAMS.
 Jeff: AND GEN X IS
OUTNUMBERED.
 WE HAVE TO GET THE
MILLENNIALS GONE.
 BUT HANNAH WANTS PAYBACK.
I CAN'T TRUST JAY.
I HOPE I CAN GET MY FREAKIN'
REVENGE.
 I'M PRETTY PISSED OFF.
I THINK IT WAS THE DUMBEST
DECISION.
MY FOCUS WAS THE END, AND I'M
NOT EVEN AT THE MERGE.
HAD JAY BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL HIS
PARANOIA, THIS GROUP OF FOUR
WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO THE END.
WE WOULD HAVE RAN THIS THING
TOGETHER AND SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE
WALKED AWAY WITH A MILLION
BUNGS.
BUT OH WELL, I'M GOINGñr TO GET
RICH SOME WAY.
