         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE GEN-X TRIBE,
PAUL WAS IN CHARGE OF AN
ALLIANCE OF SIX.
 I 100% WANT TO BE IN CONTROL.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO BE.
 Jeff: BUT THE ELEMENTS
BROUGHT HIM DOWN.
 IT WAS HEAT EXHAUSTION.
 Jeff: AT THE MILLENNIALS
TRIBE, ZEKE, ADAM, HANNAH AND
MARI WANTED TO DISMANTLE THE
POWER COUPLE.
 TAYLOR AND HE ARE REALLY
CLOSE.

 Jeff: MICHELLE HAD PLANS OF
HER OWN.








 I MIGHT HAVE TO PULL STRINGS
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE I
HAVE THE NUMBERS.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MICHELLE CONVINCED HANNAH AND
THE MAJORITY OF THE TRIBE TO
VOTE OUT MARI.
MARI, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING ZEKE AND ADAM ON THE
OUTSIDE.
18 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 DUDE, WHAT A VOTE.
 I'VE GOT TO SAY, WELL PLAYED,
EVERYBODY.
 WOW.
 THAT WAS NICE.








 WOW.
TAYLOR, FIGGY, HATS OFF TO YOU
GUYS.
 NO HATS OFF TO US.
ZEKE AND ADAM WERE LIKE, TAYLOR,
FIGGY, WELL DONE, I COMMEND YOU.
IT'S LIKE, IT'S NOT JUST US,
BUDDY.
THERE WERE SEVEN VOTES.
 THAT DID IN THE FEEL GOOD.
 IT DIDN'T, AT ALL.
 PEOPLE WHO WRITE DOWN FIGGY'S
NAME GO HOME.
 I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE AN ADULT
ABOUT IT AND NOT PLAY VICTIM.
 CAN WE JUST TALK TOMORROW?
 I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW
THINGS.
I HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT
WALKING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
MICHELLE TOLD ME AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL THAT THEY HAD THE
NUMBERS.
I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT OF VOTING
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE.
EVEN WALKING INTO TRIBAL, I
THOUGHT FIGGY WAS GOING HOME.
MICHELLE SAYS, TRUST ME, WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS.
AND SUDDENLY, I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE.
I DID WHAT I FELT WAS BEST FOR
MY GAME.
AND I HAD TO.
AND IT SUCKED.
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR YOU TO FEEL
SORRY FOR ME, DUDE.
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU TO...
 I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW.
 OKAY.
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE TOTALLY IN
CONTROL OF THE GAME AND YOU'RE
TOTALLY EXCITED TO GO THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND THEN, OH, WAIT, YOU
GET TOTALLY BLIND SIDED?
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT.
 I DON'T CARE IF YOU YELL AT
ME.
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK TO
YOU RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME SPACE.
 IT WAS GOING TO BE A 6-4
VOTE, DUDE.
 CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME SPACE
RIGHT NOW.
 THAT'S ALL HE'S ASKING.
 BUT...
 CAN YOU RESPECTED THAT I
DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT
NOW AND JUST GO TALK TO EVERYONE
ELSE AND MAYBE WE'LL TALK LATER.
 I JUST WANT YOU TO...
 NO, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, I'M NOT
GOING THE SAYING I'M NOT GOING
TO CONSIDER YOUR ARGUMENT.
I'M UPSET RIGHT NOW.
I'M PARTICULARLY UPSET WITH YOU.
PLEASE GIVE ME A SEC TO BREATHE.
 I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M JUST
SAYING, BEFORE YOU BREATHE, JUST
MEDITATE ON THIS.
 HANNAH, PLEASE.
 HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO
YOU RIGHT NOW.
HE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
 JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
 DURING TRIBAL THE VOTE --
 OH, MY GOD, HANNAH, YOU'RE...
WHATEVER.
 OKAY.
 HE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
RIGHT NOW.
 OKAY.
OKAY, GUYS.
OKAY.
I'M THE WORST PERSON EVER.
 HE'S NOT SAYING THAT.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK RIGHT
NOW.
 I KNOW THAT, ADAM.
 THEN DON'T PLAY THE VICTIM
RIGHT NOW.
 I'M NOT PLAYING THE VICTIM.
 YES, YOU ARE.
 I'M NOT THE VICTIM.
 TALK TO HIM LATER.
 HOPEFULLY SOMETHING CAN
HAPPEN WITH ZEKE AND ADAM.
HOPEFULLY I CAN REPAIR ENOUGH TO
THE POINT WHERE WE CAN WORK
TOGETHER OR MAYBE EVEN ADAM AND
ZEKE CAN MAKE A MOVE USING ME.
I WANT THEM TO USE ME.
USE ME!
I DON'T LIKE EVERYONE IN THIS
DAMN MAJORITY ALLIANCE.
 I THIS WE JUST GOT TO BE
CHILL.
 I'M GLAD WE WERE SITTING NEXT
TO EACH OTHER, THOUGH.
BECAUSE AT LEAST I KNEW WHO WAS
THE OTHER FOOL.
 THAT'S ME.
YOU AND ME ON DUMB ASS ISLAND.
 IT'S BEEN MY DREAM SINCE I
WAS NINE YEARS OLD TO PLAY THIS
GAME AND HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE,
AND I DID NOT EXPECT MY FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL TO BE MY FIRST
#BLINDSIDE.
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY
FROM THE BOTTOM.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF WORK
TO GET BACK INTO A POSITION OF
POWER.
I WOULDN'T COUNT ME OUT.
I THINK I CAN GET BACK UP TO THE
TOP AGAIN.

 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SKY.
 UH-HUH.
 RED SKY AT NIGHT, SAILOR'S
DELIGHT.
RED SKY IN THE MORNING, SAILORS
TAKE WARNING.
 I HAVE FAITH THAT THINGS ARE
GOING TO GO IN OUR FAVOR.
I TRUST GOD.
I TRUST GOD.
I PRAYED REALLY HARD.
 ON MY TRIBE RIGHT NOW I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE OF WHAT'S
GOING ON, AND IT'S DEFINITELY
ME, KEN AND CeCe ON THE
BOTTOM WITHOUT QUESTION.
 IF YOU ARE NEXT, I'M RIGHT
AFTER YOU.
 YEAH.
AND I KNOW THAT.
 BUT I FOUND AN IDOL ALREADY.
THAT WAS ON MY "SURVIVOR" BUCKET
LIST.
THERE'S HOPE FOR ME.
I AN A GENERAL GEN-XER, AND I
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EVER GIVE
UP.
 NICE DAY, NOT TOO HOT, NICE
LITTLE BREEZE.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK FROM THE
DEAD.
I FEEL AWESOME TODAY.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A GUY WHO
HAS COME BACK FROM THE DEAD, I
WENT FROM FLAT ON MY BACK TO I
FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT HERE, LIKE
DAY ONE FOR ME.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET US SOME
FISH.
 ALL RIGHT.
DON'T HURT YOURSELF OUT THERE.
 NO.
 LET US KNOW IF YOU CATCH
SOMETHING.
WE'D COME HELP.
 I'M GOING TO BRING A STRINGER
AND HOPEFULLY NO SHARKS OR
BARRACUDAS TRY THE TAKE IT AWAY
FROM ME.
 I HEAR YOU.
 I'M GOING TO LET 'EM HAVE IT
AND WE'LL DO THE VICTORY AT SEA
DANCE.
I LIVE IN THE FLORIDA KEYS.
FOR ME TO GO SHOOT A NICE YELLOW
TAIL OR SOMETHING, I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE AND I GET A COUPLE
OF FISH.
HERE'S LET'S SEE IF I'M AS GOOD
AS I THINK I AM, BECAUSE HERE I
THINK I'M REALLY GOOD.
 I NEED TO CHOW ON AN OCTOPUS
OR SHARK OR SOMETHING.
 SHARK.
 HOW ABOUT A TUNA, A YELLOW
FIN TUNA.
WHY CAN'T WE CATCH THAT?
 SOMETHING WE CAN CHOMP ON FOR
LIKE A WEEK.
 BOY, THAT CURRENT IS STRONG
THIS MORNING, BUDDY, IT'S MURKED
UP REALLY BAD.
I SAW A COUPLE NICE BIG FISH IN,
THERE BUT, MAN, YOU CAN'T GET
CLOSE TO 'EM.
THE YELLOW TAILS, I GET UP CLOSE
TO THEM, BUT THE WAVE WILL PULL
ME BACK.
 PAUL COMES BACK, THERE'S A
SCHOOL OF YELLOW TAIL.
DO YOU NOT SEE TIME AND TIME
AGAIN HE SAYS SOMETHING AND
DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH?
WHO DO YOU WANT LEADING YOU INTO
BATTLE?
 THAT CURRENT WHOOPED MY ASS.
CeCe IS ON THE OUTS.
DAVID IS TERRIFIED OF ANYTHING
PHYSICAL.
WHAT ABOUT PAUL?
LIKE WHAT IS HE CURRENTLY
OFFERING THE TRIBE?
HE'S NOT PROVIDING FOOD.
HE'S NOT PROVIDING SHELTER.
AND I'M BAFFLED THAT I'M ON THE
BOTTOM.
AND I'M BAFFLED THAT I'M ON THE
BOTTOM.
 GATHER ROUND, GATHER ROUND.
WE'VE GOT TREE MAIL.
 READ IT.
 CALL IT A SUMMIT OR CALL IT
RECON, BUT CALL ON FOUR TO GO.
ORANGE ROCK IN YOUR HAND AND
YOU'LL REPRESENT AND RETURN WITH
INSIDE INFO.
 WOW.
 SO IT HAS TO BE A RANDOM
DRAW.
 GRAB IT, DON'T LOOK AT IT,
AND THEN WE'LL REVEAL ALL AT
ONCE.
 ADAM COMES BACK THE CAMP WITH
TRY MAIL.
HE HAS THIS BAG OF ROCKS.
WHOEVER GETS THE ORANGE ROCK
WILL LEAVE CAMP AND GO
INTERMARTIN LUTHER KINGLE WITH
THE OTHER TRIBE.
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO GO, BUT ME BEING A
SUPERFAN, I WANT TO BE PART OF
THIS.
WHY NOTWORK WITH PEOPLE FROM THE
OUR SIDE IF THEY HELP YOU
ADVANCE IN THE OTHER GAME.
 ONE, TWO, THREE...
 BOY.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WOW.
 YOU HAVE TO DO THE JOB OF
RECON.
 WE'RE LOSING WILL, JAY AND
TAYLOR.
 AND FIGGY.
 I'M THE BIGGEST BOY IN CAMP.
IT'S LIKE JUST GLORIOUS WHO GOT
TO GO.
IT'S ME, IT'S FIG, IT'S WILL,
AND IT'S JAY.
I'M JUST GOING, THE TOP PEOPLE
IN MY ALLIANCE.
THANK YOU.
 GUYS, WE GOT TO GO.
 ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
 BRING BACK FOOD.
 I'M FULLY EXCITED HONESTLY TO
GO ON THIS JOURNEY.
I GET THE FEEL OUT THE GEN-X
GENERATION OF, OH, WE WORK HARD
AN WE DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY.
I WANT THE SEE, WHAT'S THE RIGHT
WAY?
 BYE.
 I REALLY HOPE FIGGY AND TAILS
DON'T START MAKING OUT.
THEN WE'LL LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF
IDIOTS, LIKE MILLENNIALS REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING
BECAUSE WE'RE LETTING A POWER
COUPLE STAY IN THE GAME.
 ON THE BOAT, THE WORD
"SUMMIT" KEPT POPPING UP IN MY
HEAD.
FOR ME THAT'S A MEETING WHEN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES COME AND
THEY HAVE A G-8 SUMMIT.
 FROM THE GEN-X TRIBE,
CeCe, DAVE, PAUL AND MYSELF.
BYE, GUYS.
 I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GO DO
THIS.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE
GEN-X AND THE MILLENNIALS ARE
GOING TO MIX TOGETHER.
FOR MY GAME, MAKING SOME
CONNECTIONS IS A GOOD THING.
 PIZZA AND BEER.
 AN OLD ATTORNEY ONCE SAID TO
ME, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
OPPOSITION WITH CLEAR EYES AND A
COLD HEART.
THAT'S HOW I'M TRYING TO VIEW
THIS GAME.
SO MY STRATEGY IS TO KEEP MY
MOUTH SHUT AND JUST GET
INFORMATION.
 PEANUT BUTTER.
 PROTEIN.
 BREAK BREAD WITH YOUR RIVALS.
IT'S A TEMPORARY TRUCE.
TAKE TIME FOR SOME ONE-ON-ONE.
MORE FRIENDS YOU COULD SURE USE.
 I'M A HUGE "SURVIVOR"
SUPERFAN.
BEING SELECTED TO GO TO A SUMMIT
LIKE THIS IS FANTASTIC.
CHEERS, GUYS.
 CHEERS.
 SO FAR I'M ACHIEVING ALL OF
MY "SURVIVOR" DREAMS.
WHO IS MISSING?
WHO WENT HOME?
 MARI.
 Jeff: MARI.
DID SHE KNOW IT WAS COMING?
 NO.
NO.
 IT'S THE GAME.
 SO GOT ANY BOYFRIENDS, GIRLS
ON THE TRIBE, ANYBODY HOOK UP
YET?
ANYBODY HEADED THAT WAY?
 MOST OF US ARE OLD AND
BORING.
 I'M A LEAD SINGER IN A ROCK
BAND.
WE DO SOME ZZ TOP.
I'M OLD, IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED.
I PLAY A LOT OF STUFF YOU GUYS
PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF.
 I THINK THE MILLENNIALS THINK
A GUY LIKE ME, BECAUSE I'M
OLDER, AND THEY HAVEN'T TALKED
TO PARENTS IN A WHILE, AND TO
HAVE THEIR DAD SITTING THERE
THAT THEY CAN TALK TO, THEY
REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.
 I HONESTLY CAN SAY DAVE IS
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE GUYS
I EVER MET.
 OH, BACK AT YOU.
 TALK ABOUT A GUY THAT'S
BRUTALLY HONEST ABOUT
EVERYTHING.
A BUG FLIES ON HIM AND HE WILL
SCREAM.
I'M SURPRISED YOU CAN'T HEAR IT
AT YOUR CAMP.
 PAUL WANTS AN AUDIENCE.
HE'S IN A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND.
HE GETS ON STAGE, AND HE DOESN'T
ASK THE AUDIENCE WHAT THEY
THINK, HE TELLS THEM WHAT HE
THINKS.
THAT'S NOT A GUY I WOULD EVER
IMAGINE MYSELF ALIGNING WITH.
THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT ANNOY
ME.
 I'M GOING RIGHT IN THE AGUA.
 RIGHT NOW I'M AT THE BOTTOM
WITH CeCe AND KEN.
SO I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS AMONG THE
MILLENNIALS TRIBE, BECAUSE ONCE
THERE IS A SWAP OR A MERGE, I'M
GOING TO NEED THEIR HELP TO GET
RID OF PAUL.
 HOW IS KEN DOLL?
 I LIKE KEN.
HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU
THINK.
HE'S THE MOST HUMBLEST.
HE'S TOTALLY NOT THE KEN DOLL.
HE'S TOTALLY OPPOSITE.
 THE BOYS WENT IN THE WATER.
AND TAYLOR AN I TALKED TO
CeCe AND DAVID.
WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN IF THEY'RE
ON THE OUTS, IF THERE'S ANY
DIVISION IN THEIR TRIBE.
 DO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON THE
BOTTOM?
 WE DON'T THINK PAUL'S ON THE
BOTTOM.
 PAUL'S NOT?
 OUR TRIBE, NOBODY IS TRYING
TO RUN AROUND FOR ANY IDOLS.
 SAME HERE.
 THERE'S IN BOSS MAN?
 WELL, WE DO HAVE A COUPLE
BOSS MEN.
ONE.
PAUL DEFINITELY.
 HE WEARS IT ON HIS SLEEVE.
YOU CAN TELL.
 ME AND DAVE LET TAYLOR AND
FIGGY KNOW THAT PAUL IS THE HEAD
PERSON IN CHARGE.
HE'S THE ALPHA MALE.
HE'S THE ONE WHO IS RUNNING
THINGS IN CAMP.
SO LEAVING US ALONE, THAT'S THE
STUPIDEST DECISION THEY COULD
HAVE DID.
IT MAY COST THEM $1 MILLION.
 IF I END UP ON A SWAP WITH
YOU OR A MERGE, LET'S WORK
TOGETHER, OKAY?
 LET'S DO IT.
 I TRUST YOU.
 WE'RE SO SOLID WITH THAT
GROUP.
 I WILL PICK OFF MY TRIBE IF
YOU WANT ME TO, OKAY.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
I GOT TO HAVE A VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT 30-SECOND CONVERSATION
WITH TAYLOR, AND I MEAN IT.
COME A SWAP, IF IT'S THREE
MILLENNIALS AND TWO GEN-X, I'M
GETTING RID OF THAT OTHER GEN-X.
 HONEY, WE'RE HOME.
 PAUL, CHRIS, MYSELF AND
CeCe CAME BACK FROM THE
SUMMIT.
 WHAT WAS THE MEETING ABOUT?
 WE MET AT A REAL SUMMIT.
WE MET AT A DIFFERENT BEACH.
 EVERYBODY WANTED TO KNOW HOW
IT WAS, WHAT HAPPENED.
 THEIR TRIBE WENT, JAY,
TAYLOR, FIGGY AND WILL.
 AND THE THING ABOUT TALKING
THE TAYLOR, I FELT LIKE I HAD A
RAY OF HOPE THAT OTHER THAN
FINDING THE IDOL HAS BEEN
MISSING FOR ME THIS ENTIRE GAME.
 ALL THE GIRLS WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT KEN.
 YEAH, THEY DID.
THEY WAS ASKING ABOUT KEN.
THEY SAID THEY CALL YOU KEN
DOLL.
I SAID, NO, KEN IS THE MOST
HU
HUMBLE GUY YOU WANT TO ME, BUT
THEY CALL YOU KEN DOLL.
 THAT'S A FUN NICKNAME.
 YOU WERE CALLED THAT BEFORE?
 HALF MY CHILDHOOD.
 REALLY?
 WHERE'S BARBIE?
KEN DOLL.
 YOU NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
 WHEN YOU'RE A BOY, THE LAST
THING YOU WANT TO BE REFERRED TO
AS PLASTIC BARBIE WITH NO PENIS.
THE MILLENNIALS KNOW ME AS KEN
DOLL AND THE PRETTY BOY WITH ALL
THE THINGS THAT COME ALONG WITH
THAT.
BUT I HAVE THE STRENGTH OF BODY
AND THE STRENGTH OF MIND TO MAKE
IT FAR IN THIS GAME.
 I'M HUNGRY AND I WANT FISH
REALLY BADLY.
I'M GOING TO GO FISH A LITTLE
BIT.
THE GEN-X TRIBE I THINK WOULD BE
HURTING IF THEY GOT RID OF ME.
AS FAR AS THE CHALLENGES GO, AND
MY WORK ETHIC.
 WE NEED FOOD.
WE NEED FISH.
AND WHAT I SAY I DO, I WIND UP
DOING, 90% OF THE TIME.
IF I SAY I'M GOING TO DO
SOMETHING AND I KNOW HOW TO DO
SOMETHING, I DO IT AND IT WORKS.
PAUL IS THE GREATEST FISHERMAN,
BUT YET HE COMES BACK EMPTY
HANDED.
I WOULD NEVER GO INTO A BATTLE
WITH A LEADER WHO WAS
INCOMPETENT OR INCAPABLE.
YOU PICK THE PERSON WHO FOLLOWS
THROUGH.
YOU PICK THE PERSON WHO DOES
WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO
DO.
 COAST GUARD, MR. 40 YEARS IN
THE KEY, OWN HIS OWN BOAT,
HASN'T BROUGHT BACK ANYTHING TO
US.
 RIGHT.
 HE HASN'T BROUGHT BACK ONE
FISH, HAS HE?
 NOT A SINGLE ONE.
I WOULD SAY YOU AND SUNDAY ARE
PROBABLY TWO OF THE MOST HUMBLE
PEOPLE HERE, AND YOU MAY HAVE
OUR ROCK STAR LEAD SINGER, THE
GUY WHO NOT ONLY THINKS BUT ACTS
LIKE HE'S IN CHARGE.
IS HE OUT FOR THE TRIBE OR IS HE
OUT FOR HIM?
 I KNOW.
OBVIOUSLY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
ON THE OUTS, AND I DON'T WANT
YOU TO FEEL THAT WAY.
 IT'S JUST CONVERSATIONS GOING
ON.
I'M NOT GETTING THE NOD TO COME.
AND THAT SUCKS.
 KEN FEELS LIKE HE'S ON THE
OUTS.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY HE
FEELS THAT WAY, BECAUSE HE'S NOT
PART OF THE SIX.
 IT SEEMS THE ONLY PERSON IN
THIS CAMP THAT'S RUBBING PEOPLE
THE WRONG WAY IS PAUL.
 KEN WANTS TO VOTE OUT PAUL,
BUT I'VE COMMITTED MYSELF TO
CHRIS AND PAUL AND BRET AND
SUNDAY AND LUCY, WHO ARE MY BEST
BET MOVING FORWARD.
AND DAY 36, I WILL THEN GET TO
READ THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE I
FOUND AND THEN UTILIZE THAT TO
MY ADVANTAGE.
FOUND AND THEN UTILIZE THAT TO
MY ADVANTAGE.
 I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOU GUYS,
YOU ALL WILL COME AND VISIT ME
IN NASHVILLE AND WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE THE TIME OF OUR LIVES.
 STRATEGICALLY, THE MILLENNIAL
TRIBE IS MOVING FORWARD AND IT'S
REALLY GREAT FOR ME.
ME AND FIGS ARE PRETTY GOOD AT
THE MOMENT.
MY GIRL'S HERE.
SHE'S HAPPY.
THIS COULDN'T BE A BETTER
POSITION TO BE IN REALLY.
 IT'S JUST NICE TO SIT OUT
HERE.
 AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY WHAT'S
GOING ON OUT THERE.
 WE ALREADY GOT RID OF ONE.
GOT TO GET RID OF THE OTHER TWO.
ZEKE IS GOING TO BE NEXT TO GO.
 HE'S GOING TO KICK OUR ASS AT
THE END.
 GOT TO BE ZEKE.
 NOTHING TO IT.
 THE STATUS QUO OF THE TRIBE
IS NOT A GOOD POSITION FOR ME.
I'M STILL FLABBERGASTED BY THAT
VOTE BECAUSE FIGGY SUCKS AT
SURVIVING.
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OBVIOUS PAIR
THAT IS STRONG, GOOD-LOOKING,
TALENTED IN THE CHALLENGES AND
NOT BE A THREAT IN THIS GAME, SO
IF FIGGY GOES HOME, THERE WOULD
BE A SHIFT, AND THAT'S WHAT I
NEED TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO HAVE
SOME SEMBLANCE OF POWER HERE.
 IF YOU'RE TAYLOR AND FIGGY,
WHOM DO YOU CREDIT FOR SAVING
FIGGY'S LIFE IN THAT VOTE?
MICHELLE, RIGHT?
 YEAH.
 IF YOU'RE MICHELLE AND JAY
AND YOU KNOW THAT FIGGY AND
TAYLOR CREDIT YOU FOR THEIR
LIVES, YOU KNOW THOSE TWO ARE
NEVER GOING TO VOTE YOU OUT.
 UH-HUH.
 SO TO ME THAT'S HELPING THOSE
FOUR ARE AS TIGHT AS CAN BE.
IF THEY STICK TOGETHER, THEY CAN
PICK OFF ANY OF US THAT THEY
WANT, AND SO ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS VOTE OUT FIGURE OR TAYLOR AND
THEN THIS CREW IS BACK IN THE
MIDDLE IN THE POWER POSITION OF
THIS TRIBE.
 I SEE YOUR POINT.
ADAM GIVES ME DIFFERENT THINGS
TO THINK ABOUT.
EVEN THOUGH I'M IN THE MAJORITY.
I STILL DON'T LIKE FIGGY.
SHE'S SNEAKY.
I DO NOT TRUST HER.
BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANY DECISIONS
RIGHT NOW.
I'M JUST WATCHING AND THINKING
AND MY GUT WILL TELL ME
SOMETHING WHEN THE TIME COMES.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
GEN-X GETTING THEIR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW MILLENNIAL TRIBE.
MARI VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 YEAH!
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
THANK YOU, BRET.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO CARRY HEAVY BAGS OVER
AND UNDER AN OBSTACLE AND THEN
ACROSS THE BALANCE BEAM.
YOU'LL THEN SEPARATE THE
SANDBAGS FROM THE COCONUTS AND
USE THE SANDBAGS TO KNOCK DOWN
LARGE PUZZLE PIECES.
ONCE ALL THE PIECES ARE ON THE
GROUND, YOU'LL THEN RACE TO
REASSEMBLE THE PUZZLE.
FIRST TO GET IT RIGHT WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
A REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: IT WOULD BE NICE TO
HAVE A LITTLE COMFORT.
[APPLAUSE]
HAMMOCKS, BLANKETS, PILLOWS,
CANDLES AND TWO CUSTOM SURVIVOR
LOUNGE CHAIRS.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
TAKE A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST YOU GOT TO GET FIVE PEOPLE
UNDER AND OVER ALL THESE
OBSTACLES WITH THAT BAG WITH
YOU.
THAT'S A HEAVY BAG.
THAT'S 40-PLUS POUNDS.
 UP AND OVER.
GO.
GO, GO GO,.
 GEN-XERS FALLING BEHIND.
 COME ON, PAUL.
COME ON, PAUL.
 COME ON, FIG.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS ARE THERE
FIRST.
UP ON THE BALANCE BEAM.
GEN-X IS THERE.
CHRIS WILL TAKE THE BALANCE BEAM
FIRST.
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET ACROSS THE
BEAM WITH THE BAG.
THE BEAM IS TOUGH ENOUGH WITHOUT
40 POUNDS.
 GOOD JOB.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 Jeff: NOW WE'RE TIED.
IT IS NOW WILL AND BRET.
 NINJA FOCUS.
 TAKE IT EASY.
 Jeff: WILL DROPS.
GOT TO GO BACK.
BRET DROPS.
GO.
IT'S CeCe NOW UP FOR GEN-X.
 LET'S GO, GUYS, LET'S GO.
 IF YOU CAN'T DO IT, SOMEBODY
ELSE FROM YOUR TRIBE CAN.
IT JUST MEANS THEY HAVE TO GO
TWICE, AND YOU STILL HAVE TO GET
ACROSS.
 STAY CALM, FIG.
STAY CALM.
YOU GOT IT.
GOOD GIRL.
 Jeff: FIGGY IS ACROSS.
YOU'RE GOOD.
HERE COMES TAYLOR.
HE'S NOW GOING THE TAKE WILL'S
BAG.
WILL STILL HAS TO GET ACROSS
YOURSELF.
CeCe TAKING A LONG TIME ON
THAT BEAM.
WHEN SHE COULD JUST LET ANOTHER
TRIBE MEMBER TAKE THE BAG, WHICH
IS WHAT THE MILLENNIALS ARE
DOING.
TAYLOR ACROSS AGAIN.
TAYLOR COMING BACK.
CeCe IS TAKING FOREVER.
IT'S GOING TO COST HER TRIBE A
LOT OF TIME.
MICHAELA NOW OUT ON THE BEAM.
 YOU GOT IT, MICHAELA.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS WITH A
BIG LEAD NOW THANKS THE A GREAT
STRATEGY.
 YOU GOT THIS, MICHAELA.
 Jeff: MICHAELA IS ACROSS.
YOU GOT TO GO.
LUCY NOW ON.
TAYLOR HAS BECOME A WORKHORSE
WITH THE FIFTH AND FINAL BAG FOR
THE MILLENNIALS.
THE MILLENNIALS HAVE ALL THEIR
BAGS.
NOW THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR OTHER
TWO PLAYERS ACROSS.
 WILL, STAY CALM.
 Jeff: WILL STRUGGLING TO
STAY ON IT.
 KEEP GOING.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
 Jeff: LUCY FALLS.
SHE HAS TO COME BACK.
LUCY, YOU STILL HAVE TO GET
ACROSS THE BEAM.
 GO, PAUL, GO.
 SHE HAS TO GET ACROSS THE
BEAM.
 CALM DOWN.
 DROP, DROP.
 Jeff: WILL'S ACROSS.

OF TIME.

PAUL NOW GOING ACROSS WITHOUT A
BAG.

CHRIS WITH HIS THIRD BAG.
CHRIS IS ACROSS.
START SEPARATING, GEN-X.

BIG HIT BY JAY.
NOW THE PUZZLE STARTING TO COME
APART.

 Jeff: GEN-X HAS ALL THEIR
BAGS.
KEN GOING TO START THROWING.
KEN KNOCKS OUT A PIECE.

PUZZLE.
GEN-X IS CATCHING UP.
THEY ARE CLOSING THAT GAP.
KEN KNOCKS OFF TWO MORE.
ED ANY MIDDLE.
 Jeff: MICHELLE AND ZEKE
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE
PIECES.
 WE NEED ONE MORE IN THE
MIDDLE.
 Jeff: OH, ALMOST.
KEN HAS ONE LEFT.
HEAD IN.
KEN KNOCKS OFF THE LAST PIECE.
WE MIGHT HAVE A CHALLENGE AFTER
ALL.
 COME ON, YOU GUYS GOT THIS.
 Jeff: IT'S MICHELLE AND
ZEKE, SUNDAY AND DAVID.
 START WITH THE BOTTOM PIECES.
 THEY GOT IT.
 Jeff: YOU'VE BEEN STARING
AT THIS PUZZLE DURING THE ENTIRE
CHALLENGE.
NOW YOU HAVE TO REASSEMBLE IT.
 OTHER SIDE, OTHER SIDE.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS STILL
WITH A LEAD.
THEY HAVE HAD THE LEAD FROM THE
BEGINNING.
 IGUANA ON THE LEFT.
 Jeff: FIRST TO SOLVE IT
WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD.
LOSERS BACK THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 NO ONE IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 ZEKE, BACK CORNER, BACK
CORNER.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS GETTING A
LOT OF HELP FROM THE BENCH.
 THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
 DON'T MESS HIM UP.
 SHUT UP.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: ANOTHER PIECE BY
MILLENNIALS.
 THE IGUANA.
 Jeff: ANOTHER PIECE BY
GEN-X.
MILLENNIALS WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
 COME ON, SUNDAY!
 YES, YES, YES, YES.
 Jeff: DO THEY HAVE IT?
YES!
MILLENNIALS WIN IMMUNITY AND
REWARD.
 JUST COULDN'T CATCH 'EM.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS,
CONGRATULATIONS.
 YES.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM THE MILLENNIAL TRIBE.
IN ADDITION, NICE REWARD.
 QUESTION, JEFF.
 YEAH.
 CAN I SWITCH COMFORT FOR
FISHING GEAR, PLEASE?
LET ME GO FISHING.
 Jeff: HERE'S THE ONLY WAY
THIS WILL WORK, A, IF GEN-X
AGREED TO IT, AND, B, IF THE
TERMS OF WHAT THE TRADE WERE,
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THIS IS
ENOUGH FOR FISHING GEAR, WERE
ALL AGREED TO, BUT I'M TOTALLY
OPEN TO HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
.
 Jeff: IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
YOU CAN SAY NO?
 AS MUCH AS I ENJOY CATCHING
OCTOPUS AND YELLOW TAIL AND
GROUPER AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WE
AS A GROUP DECIDED THAT THEY CAN
KEEP THE CHAIRS AND THE COMFORT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
MILLENNIALS, GRAB YOUR REWARD,
HEAD BACK THE HEAD BACK TO CAMP,
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
 THEY SAID NO.
IF THEY WERE OUR PARENTS, THEY
WOULD HAVE SAID YES, BUT WE'RE
ALREADY BEATING THEM, SO THEY
DON'T WANT THE MAKE US STRONGER.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
 Jeff: GEN-X, SOMEBODY FROM
YOUR TRAIN WILL BE THE THIRD
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 CeCe, SHE WANTED THAT
PERSONAL VICTORY OF INCHING
ACROSS THE BALANCE BEAM.
THREE AND A HALF MILLENNIALS GOT
ACROSS IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME.
IT WAS A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I'M NOT SURE
HOW CeCe DOESN'T GO HOME
TONIGHT.
♪
 EVERYBODY FOUGHT.
 SO WE MOVE FORWARD, RIGHT?
 IN MY OPINION, CeCe COST
US THE CHALLENGE.
THERE WAS NO QUESTION WHO WAS
GOING HOME AFTER THAT.
 ALL RIGHT.
WILL REST FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE
DOING.
 BUT IT'S "SURVIVOR," AND I'VE
SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE, WHEN YOU
GET TOO COMPLACENT, THINGS
HAPPEN.
BUT I THINK EVERYBODY IS ON
BOARD WITH VOTING OUT CeCe
UNANIMOUSLY.
 SHE CAN'T DO THESE
CHALLENGES.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
 THREE AND A HALF OUT OF FIVE
PEOPLE CROSSED ON HER.
 I KNOW.
 THAT'S HUGE.
 WATCHING IT...
 IT WAS PAINFUL.
 SO WE'RE ALL AGREEING, RIGHT,
WHO IS GOING HOME?
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
 I WENT TO THE WELL WITH CHRIS
AND BRET.
WE BASICALLY TALKED ABOUT
STICKING TO OUR ALLIANCE OF SIX
SOME WHAT WE HAVE ON THE DOCKET
FOR TONIGHT IS TO VOTE OUT
CeCe.
 WE HAVE TO KEEP THE TEAM
STRONG.
 I'M SORRY.
 VOTING CeCe OUT TO KEEP
THE STRONG IS A GOOD THING TO
DO.
SHE HAS NOT DONE WELL IN
CHALLENGES.
I CAN'T ARGUE IT AT ALL.
 SO IT'S TIME.
 YEAH.
 DO YOU GIRLS HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THE PLAN IS?
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'M CLUELESS.
 I THINK THE BOYS ARE WORKING
OUT THE DETAILS.
 I'M WORRIED ABOUT TONIGHT
BECAUSE I HAD THREE VOTES LAST
TIME, AND, OF COURSE, NO ONE
EVER COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS,
HEY, LET'S DO THIS.
PAUL NEVER COMES UP TO ME.
BRET, CHRIS, SUNDAY, JESSICA AND
LUCY, THEY NEVER COME UP TO ME.
I'M 100% WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
 KEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
US TRYING TO PUT A TARGET ON
PAUL?
CeCe, WE'RE ALREADY ON THE
BOTTOM, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
ANYTHING TO LOSE.

WE HAVE TO GET
RID OF PAUL.
AS SOON AS PAUL GOES AWAY, THEN
SOME OTHER CONNECTIONS AND BONDS
CAN START FORMING.
 THERE'S CeCe, MYSELF AND
KEN ON THE BOTTOM.
I ALREADY RETRIEVED MY IDOL FROM
ITS HIDING SPOT, BUT OTHER
PEOPLE COULD ABSOLUTELY TAKE
CONTROL OF THE GAME IF THEY
WANTED TO AND VOTE OFF PAUL.
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.
I WISH THEY COULD SEE.
THERE'S JUST NO POINT OF KEEPING
PAUL ON THEIR SIDE.
 IT SEEMS TO EASY NOT TO JUST
HOLD AND STAY THE COURSE, RIGHT?
SO WE HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE IN
MIND, RIGHT?
WE HAVE CeCe AND WE GO DOWN
THE LINE?
 YEP.
 AND WE JUST PLACATE EVERYBODY
IN THE MEANTIME.
 OF COURSEFUL.
 AS LONG AS YOU GUYS DON'T DO
A BOY THING.
 OH, NO, YOU HAVE MY WORD, IF
THEY CAME UP, I WOULD TELL YOU.
IF THEY DECIDED TO DO THAT, I
WOULD SAY, LADIES, YOU'RE ON
YOUR OWN.
 PAUL SAID TO ME THAT IF THE
BOYS CAME IN AND SAID THEY
WANTED TO DO AN ALL-BOYS THING,
I'D SAY GOOD LUCK, GIRL.
I WENT, WHAT?
I KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT DOWN WITH
ME.
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM AS FAR AS
THE SIX.
 YEAH.
 IT'S THE BOYS AGAINST THE
GIRLS.
 I FEEL LIKE HE'S A BIGGER
THREAT.
 YEAH.
 I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT.
 I DON'T KNOW.
YOU THINK DAVE WOULD BE ON BOARD
WITH THAT?
 WE'D NEED KEN, CeCe AND
DAVE.
 I'M SURE CeCe, KEN AND
DAVE WOULD VOTE OFF PAUL, SO
TONIGHT WE HAVE A VERY BIG
DECISION TO MAKE.
IF WE DETERMINE THAT VOTING OFF
PAUL WILL BE THE BEST THING FOR
OUR TRIBE, I AM GOING TO BE
HURTING TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT
I'VE WORKED WITH, BRET AND
CHRIS.
 WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT?
 YEAH.
WE'RE 100%.
 ALL THE WOMEN ARE OVER THERE.
 THEY'RE FINE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 OH, GOD.
THIS IS SO HARD.
 I'M FEARFUL OF WHAT WILL
HAPPEN IF WE DON'T VOTE OFF
PAUL, BUT I'M FEARFUL OF WHAT
WILL HAPPEN IF WE DO VOTE OFF
PAUL.
 Jeff: DAVID, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE SUMMIT.
WHO WENT FROM YOUR GROUP?
 IT WAS MYSELF, CHRIS, PAUL,
AND CeCe.
 Jeff: SO YOU MIXED TRIBES.
YOU MEET EACH OTHER.
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKEAWAY?
 THE THING THAT DID STRIKE ME
AS ODD IS I SAW THE MILLENNIALS
AS PEOPLE AND PEERS.
IT WAS A MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN
ALL OF US, AND I'M FEELING LIKE
TRANSFORMED IN SOME WAY.
 Jeff: WHAT IS IT THAT'S
CHANGED, DAVID?
BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY NERVOUS AT
THE FIRST TRIBAL, AND YOU DO SEE
MUCH MORE CALM.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
 THIS EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY IS
HELPING ME COPE WITH MY ANXIETY,
SO IT'S NOT THAT I FEEL LIKE I'M
ANY SAFER IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW.
IT'S JUST LIKE TEARING DOWN THE
WALLS AND ENERGY I HAVE FOR THE
ANXIETY, SO IT MAKES ME MORE
CALM.
 Jeff: CeCe, YOU WERE
ALWAYS VERY NERVOUS.
TURNED OUT RIGHTLY SO.
YOU GOT VOTES.
 I GOT THREE VOTES.
I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE.
NO ONE WAS TALKING TO ME.
NO ONE WAS GIVING ME A STRAIGHT
ANSWER.
AND I STILL FEEL THE SAME WAY
TODAY.
THERE'S THREE PEOPLE AT THE
BOTTOM AND EVERYONE ELSE IS AT
THE TOP.
 Jeff: WHO IS AT THE BOTTOM?
 I THINK MYSELF, DAVE AND
POSSIBLY KEN.
 Jeff: CHRIS, IF THERE IS AN
ALLIANCE OF SIX, HOW DO YOU
NAVIGATE KEEPING EVERYBODY
TOGETHER WHEN THERE IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO GO BE CeCe
AND DAVID AND KEN AND SAY, LET'S
MAKE SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN
BECAUSE I THINK I MIGHT BE
NUMBER FIVE?
 WAY TOO EARLY TO BE MAKING
THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO STICK
TO AN ALLIANCE, IT'S VERY
DANGEROUS TO START MAKING THOSE
ASSUMPTIONS WHO IS FIVE AND SIX
RIGHT NOW, WAY TOO EARLY.
 Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE TODAY.
JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING,
CeCe, DID YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT GETTING OVER THE BALANCE
BEAM?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: AND IT WAS VERY
IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU FINISHED.
TOOK A LONG TIME.
WHAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T SEE WERE
THE MILLENNIALS WHO MOVED ACROSS
THAT BALANCE BEAM QUICKLY
BECAUSE THEY COOPERATED.
BRET, WATCHING YOU GUYS, IT
LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF
INDIVIDUALS.
 I THINK THAT MIGHT BE SOME
TRUTH TO THAT.
I MEAN, IS IT BECAUSE OF PRIDE
THAT WE HAD, COULD BE.
I DON'T KNOW.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, DO YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT?
BECAUSE I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HOW
EFFICIENTLY THE MILLENNIALS
WORKED TOGETHER TO FIGURE IT
OUT.
 RIGHT, FOR GEN-XERS, WE THINK
OF EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF IT'S
THE RIGHT WAY OR THE WRONG WAY.
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT OR
WRONG, BUT YOU MAY GET THERE A
DIFFERENT PATH.
I FEEL LIKE MY KIDS THAT ARE
MILLENNIALS, THEY'LL GIVE
ANYTHING A TRY.
THEY'LL TRY IT WITH ANYBODY AND
THEY'LL TRY IT 80 DIFFERENT
WAYS.
 Jeff: I HAVE A QUESTION,
JUST CURIOSITY.
PAUL, DO YOU TEXT?
 NO.
A LITTLE BIT.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, DO YOU TEXT?
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: WHEN YOU WRITE THE
WORD YOU, AS IS IN SEE YOU
LATER, DO YOU SPELL Y-O-U, OR DO
YOU USE THE LETTER "U"?
 I WRITE Y-O-U.
 Jeff: INTERESTING BECAUSE
THE MILLENNIALS WILL TELL YOU
THE LANGUAGE IS CHANGING AND YOU
CAN CHANGE WITH US.
BUT IT'S MORE EFFICIENCY.
 THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
EFFICIENCY BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING POETIC ABOUT LANGUAGE.
YOU LOSE THAT FOUNDATION OF
LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE, WE LOSE
SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
LET'S BE EFFICIENT, BUT DON'T
LOSE SIGHT OF THE PAST.
 Jeff: BUT KEN, HOW FAR AWAY
IS THAT COMMENT FROM BEING THE
GUY THAT SAYS, VINYL IS THE ONLY
WAY THE LISTEN THE MUSIC.
[LAUGHTER]
 THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
VINYL OVER DIGITAL THAT I DIG.
I LIKE VINYL.
 Jeff: SO BEFORE WE GO TO
THE VOTE, WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF
PARANOIA RIGHT NOW, PAUL?
 I THINK THE LEVEL OF PARANOIA
WITHIN THE SIX IS LOW, AND I
THINK THE LEVEL OF PARANOIA FOR
THE THREE IS HIGH.
BUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SITTING IN
THE SIX MADE THOSE OTHER MOVES
TO GET THEM IN THAT SIX.
AND I HAVE JUST AS MUCH OF A
CHANCE TO BE SITTING THERE AS
THEY DO.
I'M SURE I'LL BE SITTING THERE
ONE DAY, AND I WON'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT EITHER.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE NOT HERE TO GO CAMPING.
WE'RE HERE TO PLAY THE GAME.
 Jeff: KEN, COULD YOU FEEL
THAT LEVEL OF PARANOIA AS ONE OF
THE THREE.
 I THINK SOME PEOPLE
DEFINITELY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN OTHERS, BUT FOR ME IT COMES
DOWN TO MY WORK ETHIC.
I WANT TO BE ABASSET.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S HELPING, BUT I
CAN BE NEEDED.
 Jeff: CeCe, WHAT ODDS
DO YOU GIVE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW?
 10%.
 Jeff: REALLY?
JESSICA, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
RESULT WILL BE?
 I'M HOPING THE RESULTS HELP
THIS TRIBE MOVE FORWARD AS A
TRIBE.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE
DIVISIONS, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO
FOCUS ON WINNING THE NEXT
CHALLENGE, AND THAT'S NOT GOING
TO TAKE THE SIXEOF US.
IT'S GOING THE TAKE EVERYONE WHO
IS LEFT.
 Jeff: OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
BRET, YOU'RE UP.
BRET, YOU'RE UP.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE PAUL.
CeCe.
PAUL.
CeCe.
TWO VOTES PAUL, TWO VOTES
CeCe.
PAUL.
THAT'S THREE VOTES PAUL.
CeCe.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
THREE VOTES PAUL, THREE VOTES
CeCe.
PAUL.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES PAUL, THREE
VOTES CeCe.
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT, PAUL.
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
PAUL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: WELL, WHETHER YOU'RE
A MILL MILLENNIAL OR A GEN-XER,
BLIND SIDE IS A BLIND SIDE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
"SURVIVOR," TENSIONS ARE HIGH AT
THE GEN-X TRIBE.
 DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE.
 WE WENT FROM ONE DICTATOR TO
ANOTHER.
 Jeff: BUT THE REAL BATTLE
IS AGAINST THE MILLENNIALS.
 THEIR GUYS ARE HUGE.
 Jeff: TAYLOR TAKES HER TOP
OFF.
 YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE SOME
TA-TAS TODAY.
 WOW.
 BLIND SIDED 150%.
APPARENTLY SOMEBODY PLAYED
BETTER THAN I DID.
AND I'M STILL KIND OF IN SHOCK.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO
VOTED FOR ME AND WHAT HAPPENED.
WHEN I GOT SIX, IT WAS PRETTY
SCARY, BUT "SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN A
GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
AT 52 YEARS OF AGE, I'VE BEEN
THROW A LOT IN MY LIFE, AND I
WOULD SAY THIS RATES UP THERE
WITH NUMBER ONE.
