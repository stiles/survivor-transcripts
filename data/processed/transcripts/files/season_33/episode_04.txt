         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": AT THE MILLENNIAL
TRIBE, ZEKE AND ADAM WERE
BETRAYED AFTER A BLINDSIDE.
 I'M UPSET RIGHT NOW.
 NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY
FROM THE BOTTOM.
 Jeff: AT THE GEN-"X" TRIBE,
DAVID FOUND AN IDOL AND THOUGHT
HE MIGHT NEED TO USE IT.
 IT'S DEFINITELY ME, KEN, AND
CECE ON THE BOTTOM.
 Jeff: BUT JESSICA WANTED TO
TURN ON THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE.
 VOTING OFF PAUL WOULD BE THE
BEST THING FOR OUR TRIBE.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SUNDAY AND LUCY WENT ALONG WITH
JESSICA'S PLAN AND VOTED OUT
PAUL.








PAUL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
BLINDSIDING BRET AND CHRIS.
17 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 I WOULD LIKE TO TALK.
 I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
TONIGHT.
I'LL DO IT IN THE MORNING.
WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM TRIBAL I
WAS, QUITE FRANKLY, PISSED OFF.
I MEAN, THAT WAS A BIG
BLINDSIDE.
I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE THE RICE AND
THROW IT IN THE OCEAN AND MAKE
MY OWN TRIBE OF ONE IS WHAT I
WAS GOING TO DO.
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
HAPPENED.








 HE WAS RUNNING THE SHOW.
 STOP WHISPERING.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
 WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S
GOING ON.
 EXACTLY.
 HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE WERE UP
AGAINST.
PAUL LOOKED RIGHT AT ME AND
SAID, "IF BOYS WANT TO DO AN
ALL-BOYS' THING, GOOD LUCK."
 TONIGHT THERE ARE SOME VERY
UNHAPPY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY BRET
AND CHRIS.
WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELIEVE ME I
REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I THINK RIGHT NOW THERE'S TOO
MUCH ANGER.
 THIS HURT, TRUST ME.
THIS WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION
FOR ANY OF US TO MAKE.
 IT SEEMED EASY.
 I AM VERY NERVOUS NOW.
I AM HOPING THAT THIS WASN'T A
BAD IDEA.
 DID WE MAKE A MISTAKE?
 WELL, YOU CAN'T THINK BACK.
 YOU MOVE FORWARD.
 THIS MORNING, I FELT BAD
BECAUSE BRET AND CHRIS FELT
BETRAYED.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU CHEATED ON SOMEBODY.
AND THEN NOW THE RELATIONSHIP
HAS TO MEND ITSELF.
 YEAH, JUST TIME.
 GIVE THEM TIME?
 YEAH.
THE GUYS ARE PISSED OFF BECAUSE
THEY REALLY TRUSTED JESSICA.
AND, HONESTLY, I DON'T TRUST
JESSICA COMPLETE.
SHE'S THE FIRST ONE THAT
IMPLANTED IN MY HEAD VOTING OUT
PAUL, RIGHT.
THERE'S A REASON WHY SHE'S
IMPLANTING THAT IN MY HEAD.
IT'S LIKE SHE'S KIND OF TRYING
TO TAKE CONTROL, AND FOR ME, I
FEEL I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
 SO, ON MY BEHALF, LIKE ALL--
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A GAME.
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU TWO ARE
VALUABLE, BUT I ALSO CAN TELL
YOU THAT THE POWER HUNGRY PERSON
HAD TO TAKE AWAY ANOTHER
POWER-HUNGRY PERSON.
 I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
 LUCY COME UP SAYING JESSICA'S
THE ONE PULLING ALL THE STRINGS
HERE.
JESS HAS A HUGE GAME GOING.
AND I APPLAUD HER FOR THAT, BUT
YOU'VE NOW SHOWN YOUR CARDS.
 I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW, KEN
AND DAVE COMPLETELY TRUST ME.
SO IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING YOU
WANT TO DO IT CAN HAPPEN.
 YOU THINK IT CAN HAPPEN?
 COMPLETELY.
 I DON'T TRUST JESS AS FAR AS
I CAN THROW HER.
 RIGHT, BUT I'M LETTING YOU
GUYS KNOW I CAN.
 GOT IT.
LUCY FEELS LIKE SHE HAS DAVE AND
KEN IN HER POCKET AND POSSIBLY
WOULD MAKE A MOVE ON JESS.
I DON'T LIKE JESS.
I CAN'T STAND HER.
SO IF I CAN HELP CHOP JESS,
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW.
NEXT TRIBAL, YOU GOTTA ZAP HER
ASS.
 RIGHT.

 GO HUNTING FOR THAT PIG OR
WHATEVER IS OUT THERE SO WE CAN
EAT IT.
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A
PIG ON THIS ISLAND?
 WELL, WE SAW PIG TRACKS ON,
LIKE, THE BEACH.
 THE DEFINITIONAVE MILLENNIAL
WOULD BE A YOUNG PERSON WITH A
LOT OF DREAMS READY TO GO OUT
AND CONQUER THE WORLD.
 LET'S GO KILL A PIG!
 AND I APPRECIATE THAT,
BECAUSE I'M A DREAMER.
GEN-X IS LIKE, "OKAY, HOLLY,
COLLEGE, 9 TO 5.
GET A LIFE."
I DON'T WANT THAT.
 WAIT, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
 IT'S A GOAT.
 WHERE IS IT?
WHERE IS IT?
 IT'S UP THERE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WE SHOULD CLIMB UP THE
HILLSIDE.
 LET'S GO GET IT.
 TALK QUIETLY.
 I KNOW.
 THEY ARE ALL THE WAY UP
THERE.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY CAN'T BE ACTUALLY HUNTING,
RIGHT?
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL SEARCHING
HAS REALLY DIED DOWN AT THIS
CAMP, BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT
IT MIGHT STILL BE OUT THERE, AND
SO I DO FEEL LIKE I NEED TO
REDEDICATE MYSELF TO THAT
SEARCH.
BECAUSE AFTER MARI WAS VOTED
OUT, MY HEAD IS DEFINITELY ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
AND IF I CAN SOMEHOW GET MY
HANDS ON AN IDOL, I COULD SAVE
MYSELF.
OH, MY-- OH, MY-- OH, MY GOD!
I KNEW IT!
I KNEW IT!
OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T EVEN OPEN IT I'M SO
EXCITED.
"MOTHER NATURE HIDES YOUR
SAFETY.
YOUR TRIBE MOTIF MARKING THE
POWER.
YOUR PRIZE IS WELL SHELTERED."
GOD, WHY CAN'T IT JUST BE HERE?
I HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING?
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
FOR A "SURVIVOR" SUPER-DUPER FAN
LIKE ME, THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE
MADE OF.
I FOUND THE CLUE, AND NOW I'VE
JUST GOT TO FIGURE THIS THING
OUT.
 ANY LUCK?
 NO.
 NO GOAT.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I
CAN SPARE LOOKING FOR IT.
SO I GOTTA GO BACK TO CAMP AND
LOOK ANOTHER TIME.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 MICHAELA CRUSHES IT.

NIGHTMARE FROM THE BEGINNING.
THEIR GUYS ARE HUGE.
I MEAN, CHRIS IS, LIKE, THE SIZE

 MICHAELA, ON THE OTHER HAND,

 M.V.P.
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
 I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I

AND WHEN THINGS HAPPEN, LIKE MY
WHOLE BATHING SUIT GETTING
RIPPED OFF, IT'S LIKE, YOU CAN
EITHER LOSE OR YOU LET YOUR
BATHING SUIT GET RIPPED OFF AND
WIN.
SO I WAS LIKE, THEY'RE ABOUT TO
SEE SOME TA-TAS TODAY.
 WE JUST MISSTRATEGIZED THIS
TIME.
WE COULD HAVE WON.
 I WISH I COULD HAVE PERFORMED
BETTER BUT THAT WAS NEVER GOING
TO BE MY CHALLENGE.
I'M NOT SUPER COMFORTABLE WITH
TOTALLY PHYSICAL COMPETITIONS.
I'M GOING TO GO WASH THESE SHOES
OFF.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I NEED TO FIND
THIS IDOL MORE THAN EVER, BUT I
DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME
LEFT BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE SURE
I FIND IT BEFORE WE EITHER GO
BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL OR SWAP.
"THE TRIBE MOTIF MARKS THE

YOU'LL FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
NO, NO.
BACK TO THE BEACH.
I'M LOOKING EVERYWHERE, AND I
JUST DON'T SEE IT.
IT'S NOT THERE.
SO I JUST WALK ALONG THE BEACH
AND HOPE THAT SOMETHING HITS ME,
THAT I FIND SOMETHING.

GEN-X EXPERIMENTING.
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES.
WHICH ONE WILL PROVE TO BE
SUCCESSFUL?
 DOESN'T FIT.
THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT!
 Jeff: GEN-X WITH YET
ANOTHER IDEA.
MILLENNIALS NOT PANICKING.
DON'T EVEN SEEM TO REALIZE THERE
IS ANOTHER TRIBE THAT THEY'RE
COMPETING AGAINST.
THEY ARE DOING THEIR OWN THING
MILLENNIAL STYLE.
 THERE'S NO "D."
WE VEHICLE OUT HERE A LONG TIME.
IT HAS BEEN A STUDY IN
CONTRASTS.
GEN-X TRIES SOMETHING IT,
DOESN'T WORK, THEY TRY SOMETHING
ELSE.
MILLENNIALS, EXPLORING IN THEIR
MINDS BUT NOT MOVING MANY
LETTERS.
 GIRLS, GIRLS.
WHAT ABOUT--
 THAT'S IT, DAVE.
THAT'S IT.
 IT'S SOMETHING...
 SOMEBODY.
LOSES SOMEBODY.

OUT OF NOWHERE, BOTH TRIBES NOW
HAVE SOME MOMENTUM.
YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY PICKING
UP NOW.
 JUST DO IT!
JUST DO IT, DAVE!
JUST DO IT!
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS THINK
THEY HAVE IT OUT OF NOWHERE.
SAY IT.
 SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR PLACE
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: THAT IS RIGHT!
MILLENNIALS WIN IMMUNITY.
NOBODY FROM THEIR TRIBE WILL BE
LOSING THEIR CLAIM TONIGHT.
MILLENNIALS, YOU WANTED IT BACK.
YOU GOT IT.

HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

ALL RIGHT, GEN-X, TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
IT WAS A HARD PUZZLE.
WHAT WERE WE GOING TO DO?
 GET THE FIRE STARTED.
 LOSING IMMUNITY TODAY WAS A
TOUGH LOSS BECAUSE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL, I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.
I MEAN, BRET AND I JUST GOT
BLINDSIDED TWO NIGHT AGO, SO I
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AT ALL.
BUT WE HAVE A PLAN TO BLINDSIDE
JESS, AND I'M COUNTING ON LUCY
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
 PUZZLES ARE JUST KILLING US.
 I OPINION.
 YOU KNOW?
 WE DID THE BEST WE COULD,
THOUGH.
 YEAH.
 I GOT THEM ON BOARD ALREADY.
 ARE YOU SURE?
 YEAH, FOR SURE, FOR SURE.
SO IT'S KEN, DAVE, YOU, ME, AND
BRET.
AND WE'LL DO JESSICA.
I'M LIKE A TIGER MOM BECAUSE THE
SCENARIO THEY LOVE IS ME BEING
IN CONTROL.
I MEAN, MY HUSBAND AND KIDS
DISLIKE ME A LOT OF TIMES
BECAUSE I'M MAKING ALL THE
DECISIONS, BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO
DO IT.
SO IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL AT HOME,
IT SHOULD BE SUCCESSFUL HERE.
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 IT'S VERY, VERY SIMPLE.
THIS MORNING WHEN YOU AND I WERE
SCOLDED AND TOLD NOT TO SPEAK TO
ANYONE, I WAS DONE.
 YEAH.
 LOOSEY AND BRET AND CHRIS AND
SUNDAY ALL LINKED UP TOGETHER.
THAT PUT YOU AND I AND CECE BACK
AT THE BOTTOM.
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN, IN MY EYES,
IS ME, YOU, CECE, JESS VOTE FOR
LUCY.
 THAT'S ONLY FOUR.
 AND JEZ PULLS IN SUNDAY.
 OH, MY GOD.
IN REAL LIFE, I THINK LUCY'S
USED TO, LIKE, CALLING THE
SHOTS, BUT OUT HERE YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY THE WRONG
THING AND RUB PEOPLE THE WRONG
WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY PISS
SOME PEOPLE OFF.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED.
BECAUSE NOW KEN WANTS TO VOTE
HER OUT.
AND TO BE HONEST, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY GREAT IDEA.
 WE'RE VOTING FOR LUCY, OKAY.
LUCY CAN'T GET WIND WE'RE
TALKING.
I WANT TO END THIS RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I SEE HER OVER THERE,
BUT LUCY, LUCY, LUCY, OKAY.
 GOT YOU.
 SWEETIE, LUCY WANTS YOU OUT.
SHE, CHRIS, AND BRET DON'T TRUST
YOU.
THEY DON'T TRUST YOU AT ALL.
THE ONLY WAY WE STAY IS IF LUCY
GOES.
 WHAT DID YOU HEAR OVER THERE,
THOUGH?
 IT'S YOUR NAME.
 WHO SAID MY NAME?
 SINCE PAUL WENT DOWN, LUCY
THINKS IT WAS ALL YOU.
LUCY CAME AND GRABBED ME AND
DAVID AND SAID YOU'RE NOT TO BE
TRUSTED.
IT'S YOUR NAME GOING DOWN.
 MY NAME.
 IT'S YOUR NAME GOING DOWN.
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO SUNDAY.
IF YOU DON'T TALK TO SUNDAY,
YOU'RE DONE.
 I AM STUNNED.
KEN'S TELLING ME THAT I'M NOW
THE ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE GUNNING
FOR BECAUSE I WAS THE MASTERMIND
BEHIND THE PAUL THING.
WHICH SURPRISES ME GREATLY,
BECAUSE I FELT WE ALL KIND OF
CAME UP WITH IT TOGETHER.
SO IT SEEMS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.
 OKAY.
I THINK WE'RE ALL VOTING CECE.
 THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
 BUT KEN'S SAYING THAT YOU ARE
TELLING EVERYBODY TO VOTE FOR
ME.
AND TRYING TO CONVINCE ME TO
VOTE YOU.
 HE SAID, "LET'S VOTE LUCY
OFF?"
 YES.
 RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE BLOWING
UP IN A BIG WAY.
 KEN TOLD JESS.
 I HAVE TO SAY I'M SHOCKED.
 THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST MOVE
IN THE WORLD.
 THAT'S JUST DUMB.
 KEN, JESSICA RAN AND TOLD
LUCY WHAT YOU SAID.
 WHY?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I'M SHOCKED.
I FELT THE CONNECTION THAT I HAD
WITH JESS WAS GENUINE.
AND I JUST FOUND OUT SHE TOTALLY
BETRAYED ME, TAKE EVERYTHING I
SAID AND DELIVERING IT TO LUCY
ON A SILVER PLATTER.
 SO WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE COMING UP
AND TELLING ME WHAT TO DO AND
TELLING ME WHO I CAN AND CAN'T
TALK TO.
YOU CAME UP TO ME AND SAID DON'T
SPEAK WITH ANYONE.
YOU CAME UP AND BASICALLY GAVE
ME A LIST OF RULES OF WHAT ME AS
AN ADULT ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO.
 KEN ENDED UP BEING A SNAKE.
HE'S PISSED OFF OF BECAUSE HOW I
CAME TO HIM.
LOOKING BACK, I GUESS I COULD
HAVE BEEN NICER.
BUT KEN IS SO EMOTIONAL LIKE A
GIRL.
GET SERIOUS.
WE'RE JUST VOTING OUT JESSICA.
WHY HAVE EMOTIONS ABOUT VOTING
PEOPLE OFF RIGHT NOW?
THE WHOLE THING SAT LEAST YOU'RE
IN THE GAME NOW, RIGHT.
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS OR NOT?
 I THOUGHT IT WAS JESSICA.
 AT THIS POINT, THINGS ARE SO
MESSED UP.
I THINK THE SAFEST THING MIGHT
BE TO JUST WRITE DOWN JESSICA'S
NAME.
BUT IF I DO THAT, I JUST END UP
BACK ON THE BOTTOM.
 YOU'RE NOT GONNA VOTE FOR ME?
 I'M NOT VOTING YOU OFF.
ANOTHER OPTION I HAVE, I COULD
PLAY MY IMMUNITY IDOL FOR
JESSICA AND SAVE HER, BUT I LIED
TO LUCY STRAIGHT TO HER FACE AND
I THINK SHE KNOWS IT.
I'M SURE SHE KNOWS IT.
 EVERYBODY PACK YOUR CLOTHES
TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVE A SNITCH
IN THIS PLACE.
 I JUST WANT TO HAVE THE IDOL
JUST FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY.
I DON'T PLAN ON PLAYING IT BUT--
AAAHHH!
I HAVE A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
I HAVE A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
 Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
DAVID, DID IT BRING THIS TRIBE
TOGETHER OR DID IT DO A BETTER
JOB OF SIGNIFYING GAME ON?
 I DON'T THINK LAST TRIBAL
BROUGHT US TOGETHER.
I THINK IT WAS STILL THE RIGHT
MOVE, BUT, YEAH, THE GAME IS
ABSOLUTELY ON.
 Jeff: CHRIS, WHAT WAS YOUR
REACTION AFTER YOU KNOT BACK TO
CAMP AFTER THE LAST VOTE?
 WELL, BRET AND I WERE CLEARLY
UPSET WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT
WERE IN THE ALLIANCE.
I MEAN, WE WERE COMPLETELY
BLINDSIDED.
THE STATE OF THIS TRIBE IS
COMPLETE CHAOS.
BUT WE HAVE GOT TO FIGURE IT
OUT, OR WE'RE IN DEEP TROUBLE.
 Jeff: SO, JESSICA, IS CHRIS
REALLY BELIEVES HE WAS
BLINDSIDED ALONG WITH BRET, WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN NOW TO THE FIVE
REMAINING OF THE SIX?
 I THINK THAT ALL OF US HAVE
BEEN PROCESSING WHY THINGS
HAPPENED THE WAY THEY HAPPENED
AT THE LAST TRIBAL.
BUT,USLY, THE RAMIFICATIONS OF
IT WE'RE STILL SEEING, AND
WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE COME BACK
TOGETHER AS A FIVE, I HOPE THAT
WE HAVE.
 Jeff: LUCY, SO IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
REALLY WAS A BOMB.
IT JUST BLEW UP, AND NOW THE
GAME IS BEING PLAYED.
 YEAH.
EVERYBODY JUST STARTED GETTING
REALLY INSECURE.
YOU KNOW, WE HEARD SO MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS.
SOMEBODY MENTIONED YOUR NAME.
SOMEBODY MENTIONED SOMEBODY
ELSE'S NAME.
SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS CHAOS.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO
VOTE FOR WHO?
 Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE TONIGHT?
 I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY, UNTIL
JESSICA TOLD ME KEN WAS
INTERESTED IN VOTING ME OUT
TODAY AND I DON'T EVEN HE WAS
ABLE TO CREATE ENOUGH NUMBERS TO
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
 Jeff: KEN, YOU'RE NODDING
YOUR HEAD LIKE YOU AGREE TO
THAT.
 YES, SHE'S REFERRING TO A
CONVERSATION WE HAD EARLIER
TODAY.
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU
CAN CAN ASK PEOPLE OF THINKS,
"DO YOU MIND DOING THIS?
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?"
AND IT'S ALSO COMING UP AND
SAYING, "YOU'RE GOING TO DO
THIS."
 THAT'S HOW I TALK.
I CAN BE BLUNT, BUT MOST OF THE
TIME WHEN I SPEAK TO MEN I THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE BLUNTNESS, AND A
LOT OF THEM TELL ME THEY
APPRECIATE IT.
IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT, IF I
WAS HIM, I WOULD BE LIKE, "WELL,
LUCY'S TELLING ME SOMETHING TO
HELP ME GO TO THE NEXT, YOU
KNOW, "--
 YOU REALIZE YOU'RE KIND OF
DOING IT AGAIN.
 NO, NO, NO, BUT WHAT I WAS
COMING AT, GET IT DONE QUICK.
HERE'S THE DECISION.
THERE'S NO EXPLANATION.
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS THE WHOLE
POINT OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO
DO.
 Jeff: SO, KEN, THE TAKEAWAY
IS LUCY NOW BELIEVES YOU WANT
HER OUT, AND HAVE AT LEAST
TALKED TO JESSICA ABOUT IT.
SO HOW COMFORTABLE ARE YOU, THAT
TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL GO THE WAY
YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GO?
 I WAIVERED ALL DAY, AND
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE
I WAS REALLY LOYAL WITH WASN'T
SO LOYAL.
YOU KNOW.
 Jeff: JESSICA, YOU HAD A
BIG REACTION.
WAS HE TALKING ABOUT YOU?
 HE WAS.
I KNOW HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.
BUT WAS I SUPPOSED TO TRUST WHAT
YOU TOLD ME 100% ABOUT WHAT YOU
TOLD ME OTHER PEOPLE SAID ABOUT
ME TODAY?
 YEAH.
 THAT'S THE THING.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S TELLING THE
TRUTH?
 IT'S A LIVE TRIBAL.
 Jeff: LIVE MEANING IT'S NOT
IN STONE.
 EXACTLY.
YOU LEAVE THE BEACH WITH AN IDEA
OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO AT
TRIBAL, AND THEN YOU GET TO
TRIBAL AND IT CHANGES.
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT TRIBAL.
IT'S COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE.
 Jeff: JESSICA, LOOK AT YOUR
BODY LANGUAGE!
HAVE YOU SECOND GUESSED YOUR
VOTE AT ALL TONIGHT?
CHRIS, HOW ABOUT YOU?
 AS FAR AS SECOND GUESSING MY
VOTE TONIGHT, I'M NOT.
I MIGHT BE HIT IN THE MOUTH
AGAIN, BUT I'M NOT SECOND
GUESSING IT.
THE ONE QUESTION YOU NEED TO ASK
IS WHO IS THE SUCKER AT THE
TABLE?
EVERYBODY MIGHT BE ALL IN, BUT
WHO IS THE CHUMP PLAYING WHO
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PLAYING?
THAT SEEMS THE BIGGER QUESTION.
 Jeff: SEEMS LIKE A GOOD
TIME TO FIND OUT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SUNDAY, YOU'RE UP.
 THIS IS FOR YOU, PAULEY.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
 Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.
 JEFF.
OH, MAN.
CAN I SAY A FEW WORDS REALLY
QUICK?
 Jeff: YEAH, STEP RIGHT UP
HERE.
 ALL RIGHT.
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW IT'S BEEN
A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.
I ENJOY ALL OF YOUR COMPANY.
AND NOW FOR MAYBE THE BIT THAT'S
GOING TO UPSET SOME PEOPLE, I'M
GOING TO PLAY THIS FOR JESSICA.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTE CAST FOR JESSICA WILL
NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, JESSICA.
DOES NOT COUNT.
JESSICA.
DOES NOT COUNT.
JESSICA, DOES NOT COUNT.
JESSICA, DOES NOT COUNT.
JESSICA, DOES NOT COUNT.
CECE.
THAT'S ONE VOTE CECE.
LUCY.
THAT'S ONE VOTE CECE, ONE VOTE
LUCY, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VS.
GEN-X," LUCY.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 Jeff: LUCY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
YOU TALK ABOUT LIVE TRIBALS.
IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE LIVE
THAN THAT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR."
THE GEN-X IDOL IS BACK UP FOR
GRABS.
 THAT IDOL SEARCH PARTY.
 Jeff: AND A SURPRISE
SWITCH-- DROP YOUR BUFFS.
THREATENS TO TEAR TWO LOVERS
APART.
 I LOVE TAYLOR.
 MY BIGGEST FEAR IS GETTING
SPLIT UP.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
 I ALMOST CONTROLLED THE WHOLE
SITUATION, AND IT ALMOST WORKED.
I WASN'T EXPECTING DAVE TO USE
THE IMMUNITY.
AND I WAS QUITE SHOCKED.
I JUST WENT FULL FORCE AND
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT A
LITTLE SLOW.
THAT'S ONE OF THE LESSONS I WAS
LEARNING.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, A LITTLE TOO
LATE.
