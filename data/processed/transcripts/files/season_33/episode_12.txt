 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," ZEKE'S ALLIANCE HAD
A NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.
OVER DAVID'S COALITION.
 THE FIVE ISN'T GOING TO PICK
US OFF ONE BY ONE.
 Jeff: BUT WILL WAS READY TO
GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT TO POWER PLAYER.
 TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
 I CAME HERE TO PLAY.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ADAM PLAYED HIS IDOL.
 I'M PLAYING THIS FOR HANNAH.
 WHAT?








 Jeff: BUT HIS MOVE PROVED
UNNECESSARY WHEN WILL FLIPPED TO
DAVID'S SIDE.
 Jeff: ZEKE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
LEAVING JAY WITH THE ONLY IDOL
LEFT IN THE GAME.
EIGHT ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 GREAT MOVE, WILL.
 NICE JOB.
 I CAME INTO THIS GAME A KID,
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M LEAVING THIS
TRIBAL THE MAN.
 BILLING YOUR RESUME, YOUNG
MAN.
 I OPENED UP EVERY DOOR
POSSIBLE FOR ME.
EVERYBODY NEEDS ME IN THIS GAME,
AND I BELIEVE I CAN START
FLIP-FLOPPING BACK AND FORTH
ENOUGH TIMES TO WIN THIS GAME.








 MAKING BIG MOVES, HUH?
THAT'S WHAT IT IS?
EVERYONE IS GOING TO STACK UP
BIG MOVES.
HOW ABOUT GET TO THE THREE?
IT'S A $1 MILLION PRIZE.
WHY WOULD YOU VOTE ZEKE BEFORE
DAVE?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I'M USED TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
GOING MY WAY.
AGAIN IT DIDN'T GO MY WAY.
WILL FLIPPED AND VOTED OUT ZEKE.
HE SAID, I WANT TO MAKE SOME BIG
MOVES IN THIS GAME.
THIS KID WANTS EVERYONE TO THINK
HE'S NOT JUST A HIGH SCHOOL KID,
BUT HE'S THINKING LIKE A HIGH
SCHOOL KID.
I GOT TO DO MY HOMEWORK.
I HAVE TO CHECK OFF ALL THESE
BOXES.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
 THIS IS GETTING TO BE A CRAZY
GAME.
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
PLAYING IT.
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY FOR ME TO
STAY ALIVE IN THIS GAME.
 LISTEN, ZEKE WAS A HUGE
THREAT.
 YEAH.
 WE JUST GOT RID OF HIM.
NOW THERE ARE A COUPLE MORE
THREATS LEFT IN THIS GAME.
JAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT WILL,
DAVE.
DAVE'S A HUGE THREAT.
IF THOSE THREE PEOPLE MAKE IT TO
THE FINAL THREE, I'M NOT
WINNING.
I MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND EAT
CAKE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?
 BRET AND SUNDAY COME UP TO ME
AND SAY DAVE, JAY AND WILL ARE
THE THREE BIGGEST THREATS IN THE
GAME, THOSE THREE NEED TO BE THE
NEXT TO GO.
AND IT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS.
 THE QUESTION IS WHO DO YOU
TAKE OUT FIRST?
 I DON'T KNOW, WHO IS MORE
IMPORTANT TO TAKE OUT?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 US THREE ARE VERY EQUAL.
WE CAN GO FAR AND GET TO THE
END.
 IF THEY WANT TO PUT
THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE
THEY'RE LEFT WITH MYSELF, HANNAH
AND KEN, I LOVE THAT.
 OKAY.
 THEY HAVE TO BE THE NEXT
THREE.
 THEY HAVE TO BE THE NEXT
THREE.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 THIS LOOKS INVOLVED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE IT
BACK.
 YOU HAVE TO GRAB IT.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT UP.
 Jeff: FAIR ENOUGH.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE OUT TO A GROUP OF
DISKS.
YOU'LL STACK THEM AND THEN
TRANSPORT THEM OVER A BALANCE
BEAM AND THROUGH A WIRE MAZE.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL TEN DISKS AT
THE FINISH, YOU'LL ATTEMPT TO
ROLL THEM INTO A TARGET.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, GUARANTEED A
ONE IN SEVEN SHOT AT WINNING
THIS GAME.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY
WILL BECOME THE SIXTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST STEP IS TO UNTIE THAT POLE
AND START STACKING YOUR DISKS.
YOU CAN TAKE ONE OR TEN.
THE FEWER TRIPS THE BETTER, BUT
IF YOU DROP, YOU HAVE TO COME
BACK AND START AGAIN.
BRET QUICKLY OUT OF THE GATE.
DAVID HEADING OUT.
EVERYBODY HEADING OUT NOW.
SUNDAY IMMEDIATELY DROPS AND HAS
TO COME BACK.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS THE
BALANCE BEAM.
IT TAKES A LOT OF COORDINATION
TO BALANCE ON A BEAM CARRYING
THAT STACK.
DAVID QUICKLY OVER THE BALANCE
BEAM.
BRET IS OVER THE BALANCE BEAM.
HE'S GOING TO DROP AND HEAD BACK
FOR MORE.
KEN IS OVER THE BALANCE BEAM.
JAY IS CLEAR.
WILL DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.
ADAM IS AFTER HIS FIRST FOUR.
SUNDAY AND HANNAH MOVING SLOWLY.
IT'S NOW DAVID, KEN, BRET AND
JAY ALL WITH THEIR REMAINING
DISKS.
DAVID WHIPPING OVER THAT BEAM
QUICKLY.
BRET FALLS OFF.
HE'S GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK.
DAVID IS BACK.
KEN DROPS.
HE'S GOOD.
NOW YOU'RE MOVING INTO THE
SECOND PHASE, WHERE YOU WILL USE
A STAFF AND HAVE TO GET THROUGH
A WIRE MAZE.
HOW MANY CAN YOU PUT ON EACH
SIDE AND FEEL SAFE?
DAVID HEADING OUT THROUGH THE
SECOND PHASE.
NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO NAVIGATE
THE WIRES, YOU ALSO HAVE TO STEP
OVER THE ROPES.
VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN YOUR
BALANCE DURING THIS.
ADAM IS GOOD.
HE CAN START ON HIS SECOND
PHASE.
IT IS NOW WILL THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CANNOT GET THROUGH THAT
FIRST PHASE.
EVERYBODY ELSE WORKING ON THE
SECOND PHASE.
NOBODY TOOK ALL TEN DISKS AT
ONCE.
SO EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO MAKE
AT LEAST TWO RUNS.
BRET IS THE FIRST ONE THROUGH.
HE'S GOT FOUR.
YOU'RE GOOD, GET THEM ON THERE
AND HEAD BACK.
IT'S NOW BRET IN THE LEAD.
HEREBY COMES JAY WITH HIS FIRST
STICK.
DAVID NEAR THE END OF THE WIRE
MAZE.
JAY IS GOOD.
HE CAN HEAD BACK FOR HIS LAST
FOUR.
IT'S NOW BRET AND JAY IN THE
LEAD.
KEN IS BACK.
ADAM HEADING BACK.
SUNDAY AND HANNAH FALLING OUT OF
THIS QUICKLY, AND WILL STILL
BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
CHALLENGE.
 YEAH, THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: JAY IS THE FIRST ONE
THROUGH.
HERE'S DAVID.
HE'S THROUGH NOW.
JAY HAS ALL TEN DISKS.
HE'S IN THE FINAL PHASE, ROLLING
THEM ENTER A TARGET.
HE'S GOT ONE.
HE HAS TO GET ALL TEN IN THERE.
DAVID, HE CAN START ROLLING.
BRET IS FINISHED.
HE CAN START ROLLING.
IT IS NOW JAY, BRET AND DAVID.
DAVID HAS ONE.
DAVID HAS ANOTHER.
ANOTHER ONE FOR JAY.
JAY GETTING HOT.
HE'S GOT FOUR.
BRET GETS ONE.
JAY WITH ANOTHER.
THAT'S FIVE FOR JAY.
MAKE IT SIX FOR JAY.
JUST MISSES.
JAY, BRET, DAVE ALL ROLLING
DISKS NOW.
THERE'S ANOTHER FOR BRET.
IT IS SIX FOR JAY, TWO FOR BRET,
TWO FOR DAVID.
THERE'S A SEVENTH.
EIGHTH.
NINTH.
ONE LEFT FOR JAY FOR THE WIN AND
RIGHT HERE.
HE DOES IT.
JAY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 GOOD JOB, MAN.
 Jeff: HUGE EFFORT.
JAY, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, JAY.
 GOOD JOB, JAY.
 THANK YOU.
JAY SAFE FROM THE VOTE TONIGHT.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
WILL LIVE TO SEE DAY 35.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME TONIGHT WILL BECOME
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBALLEN
CONGRATS.
 THANK YOU, SIR.
 IT FELT PHENOMENAL TO WIN.
I'VE ALREADY WON TWO INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGES, BUT ANY TIME JEFF
SAYS, "JAY WINS IMMUNITY," I'M
LIKE, DAMN RIGHT I WON IMMUNITY.
PUT THAT THING AROUND MY NECK.
I'LL GO SPEARFISHING IF I WANT
TO, AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
TALK TO ANY OF THESE FOOLS.
PLUS I STILL HAVE MY IDOL, AND
I'M GOING TO HOLD ON TO THIS
BABY UNTIL I REALLY HAVE TO USE
IT.
 GOOD JOB, JAY.
 THANK YOU.
 THAT WAS FUN.
NICE JOB, JAY.
 THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
 JAY AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THREE OF
THE LAST FOUR CHALLENGE HE'S
WON.
HE GOT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
TODAY, AND WE WOULD HAVE
PROBABLY TARGETED JAY TONIGHT
HAD HE NOT WON, BUT NOW WE DON'T
KNOW HOW THIS GAME IS GOING ON.
YOU NEVER KNOW FROM ONE DAY TO
THE NEXT, SO TONIGHT IS
COMPLETELY UP IN THE AIR.
 SEE HOW DAVID'S KIND OF LIKE
DYING BASICALLY, HE CAN'T WIN A
CHALLENGE.
KEN CAN.
 DAVID IS A WEASEL THAT WILL
BEAT US ALL IN THE END.
IF KEN SOMEHOW COMES TO THE END,
IT'S NOT EVEN A CONTEST.
 OKAY.
I'M DOWN.
YOU WANT THE TAKE DAVID OUT
BEFORE KEN?
 YEAH.
 I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A WORKING
RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERY SINGLE
PERSON THAT'S IN THE GAME.
PEOPLE WANT MY VOTE.
PEOPLE WANT MY INPUT.
I'M DONE BEING AFRAID.
 OKAY.
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
 SO I HAVE TO TALK TO PEOPLE
AND GET PEOPLE THE REALIZE THAT
DAVID'S THE KIND OF GUY WHERE IF
HE GETS TO THE END, HE WILL BEAT
ANYBODY, AND THAT INCLUDES ME,
WHICH MEANS FOR ME I NEED HIM
OUT OF THIS GAME.
 I THINK WE JUST GO FOR DAVID.
 I AGREE, LET'S GET DAVID OUT
OF THIS THING.
I'M WITH YOU.
 I NEED THEM TO FEEL LIKE I'M
AN EQUAL CONTRIBUTOR HERE.
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE
NOT L I'M THE ONE CALLING THE
SHOTS.
 SO MANY CONVERSATIONS ARE
HAPPENING.
UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE JAY IS
NOW SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,
THERE IS SO MUCH SCRAMBLING
GOING AROUND, AND THE MOST
INSECURITY I'VE EVER FELT IS
RIGHT NOW.
I JUST HOPE I SURVIVE TONIGHT.
 I DO, TOO.
 AT THE LAST TRIBAL WILL VOTED
WITH US, WHICH WAS GREAT.
BUT THE THING IS WILL IS LOOKING
TO PAD HIS RESUME A LITTLE MORE.
THE THING TO DO IS FOLLOW UP A
BIG MOVE WITH ANOTHER BIG MOVE.
AND THERE'S THIS PERCEPTION IN
THE TRIBE THAT I'M THE BIGGEST
THREAT IN THE GAME, AND SO,
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
GET RID OF ME TONIGHT?
 CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU?
 I'M WITH YOU GUYS.
 TOTALLY.
WILL'S PREFERENCE RIGHT OFF THE
BAT IS OBVIOUSLY TO VOTE OUT
DAVE NEXT.
WILL THINKS NOW HE HAS A DEGREE
OF POWER, AND HE'S IN CONTROL.
AND THAT MAKES HIM MORE
DANGEROUS, SO TO ME, WILL IS A
BIGGER THREAT, AND I DO NOT WANT
TO PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION
WHERE WILL IS, YOU KNOW,
CONTROLLING MY FATE IN THIS
GAME.
WILL I THINK GENUINELY WANTS TO
GO FAR WITH ME, BUT I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN THAT.
AND I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO FLIP
BACK AND FORTH, SO THE PLAN IS
I'M VOTING WILL TONIGHT.
 OKAY.
I THINK ADAM HAS BEEN SMART WITH
HOW HE'S BEEN PLAYING.
WE HAVE SOME COMMON GOALS, SO ME
AND SUNDAY AGREE, WE'LL GO WITH
ADAM AND VOTE TOGETHER.
 THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE OUT
WILL.
 DOES THIS FEEL LIKE THIS IS A
RIGHT MOVE FROM SOMEONE WHO JUST
RESCUED US FROM A REALLY BAD
SITUATION?
WE WERE SCREWED.
HIS ALLIANCE WAS GOING TO TAKE
US ALL OUT, AND I WAS GOING
HOME.
I GET THAT HE DID IT FOR HIS OWN
GAME, BUT, YOU KNOW...
 I'M TORN UP, AS I ALWAYS AM
EMOTIONALLY, BECAUSE WILL SAVED
MY BUTT IN THIS GAME.
SO IT'S LIKE, I DO OWE WILL, IN
A SENSE, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE I
OWE DAVID IN A SENSE.
DAVID PULLED A ROCK FOR ME, AND
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ALLIES.
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU END UP OWING
MORE THAN ONE PERSON.
DAVE COULD FLIP BECAUSE HE KNOWS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT HIM IN
THE END.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP
MOVING IN ORDER TO STAY IN THIS
GAME.
SO WE MAY HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO
DAVID NEXT.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 RIGHT NOW HANNAH AND I ARE IN
POWER POSITIONS.
WE CAN DECIDE WHO GOES HOME
NEXT.
IT'S A REALLY TOUGH CHOICE.
BRET AND SUNDAY ARE IN A WEAK
POSITION.
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THE WAY I
WANT THEM TO VOTE.
SO THE QUESTION IS: BLIND SIDE
WILL AND TAKE OUT SOMEONE WHO I
DO BELIEVE IS LOYAL TO ME AT
THIS POINT, OR TRY TO BLIND SIDE
DAVE AND TAKE OUT POTENTIALLY
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS GAME?
SO WE HAVE A HUGE DECISION TO
MAKE TONIGHT.
THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE I START
MAKING THE MOVES THAT I NEED TO
MAKE TO WIN THIS GAME.
MAKE TO WIN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS, JESSICA
AND ZEKE VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO, WILL, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,
EVERYTHING CENTERED ASH --
AROUND YOU.
YOU WERE THE SWING VOTE.
YOU WANTED TO SHOW YOUR PLAY.
YOU MADE A BIG MOVE, TOOK OUT
ZEKE.
WHAT WAS THE REACTION WHEN YOU
GOT BANG THE CAMP.
 I WROTE HIS NAME DOWN, AND
THEN ADAM ALSO PLAYED AN IDOL
WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE TO, AND THAT
CAUSED A LOT OF STIR AROUND
CAMP, SURE.
 Jeff: JAY, HOW DID WILL'S
MOVE SHAKE OUT WHEN YOU GUYS GOT
BACK TO CAMP?
 I WAS PROUD OF HIM AS A FAN,
BUT AS A PLAYER IT SUCKED.
 Jeff: SO DAVID, WILL MAKES
A BIG MOVE.
IT WAS 4-4.
WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE GAME?
 WELL, I HAVE CONCERNS THAT IT
MIGHT BE ME.
 Jeff: JAY, SHOULD DAVID BE
WORRIED?
 I MEAN, CONSIDERING THE LAST
VOTE, WILL WENT WITH THAT SIDE
OF THE TWO ALLIANCE, SO IF THEY
TRUST IN WILL, THEN WILL SHOULD
BE STICKING WITH THEM, SHOULDN'T
HE?
 Jeff: HANNAH, WHAT WAS YOUR
TAKEAWAY FROM WILL'S MOVE IN
TERMS OF WHAT IT DOES TO THE
GAME AND THE NUMBERS AND THE
ALLIANCES?
 ALMOST EVERYONE UP HERE HAS
BOTH WORKED WITH PEOPLE UP HERE
AND ALSO WORKED AGAINST PEOPLE
UP HERE.
AND I THINK YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PLAY
WITH YOU AND TAKE OUT THOSE
THREATS LEFT IN THE GAME.
 Jeff: ADAM, IT'S REALLY
TRICKY.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO HOW DO I
GET TO THE END AND WHO DO I TAKE
WITH ME.
 I MEAN, YOU THINK ABOUT WHO
YOU WANT TO SIT NEXT TO AT THE
END, BUT YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S MY BEST WAY TO GET THERE.
AND A LOT OF THE JURY MEMBERS
MADE SOME REALLY GOOD MOVES IN
THIS GAME, AND IT PROBABLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THEM GETTING
VOTED OUT, SO YOU HAVE THE WEIGH
BOTH OPTIONS.
 Jeff: IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED
SWORD.
YOU MAKE A BIG MOVE, GREAT, NOW
YOU'RE A BIGGER THREAT, WATCH
OUT.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: DAVID, THAT DOES
REALLY SUM UP WHERE THIS SEASON
IS.
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO
WIN THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A RESUME.
JUST BEING A NICE PERSON WILL
NOT GET IT DONE, AND YET EVERY
TIME YOU MAKE A MOVE, YOU ALSO
HAVE EVERYBODY ELSE GOING, YEAH,
THAT MIGHT BE ONE TOO MANY.
 IT'S A COMPLICATED GAME, AND
THE THING IS, IF YOU DON'T MAKE
BIG MOVES, THEN YOU'RE JUST A
GOAT, AND THEN YOU MAYBE MAKE IT
TO THE FINAL TRIBAL, BUT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
SO IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL TO MAKE
BIG MOVES AS MUCH AS IT DOES PUT
A GIGANTIC TARGET ON YOUR BACK.
 Meaghan: JAY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT?
BECAUSE THE IF I'M WATCHING AT
HOME, I HAVE NO IDEA WITH THIS
GROUP WHO IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING, JEFF,
EVERYONE HERE IS A PLAYER, I
HONESTLY AM WONDERING WHO COULD
IT BE.
THEY COULD GO WITH AN EASY VOTE
OR SOMEONE COULD BE TRYING TO
MAKE A BIG MOVE AGAIN.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
WILL, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DAVID.
DAVID.
TWO VOTES DAVID.
WILL.
WILL.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES DAVID, TWO
VOTES WILL.
WILL.
THAT'S THREE VOTES WILL, TWO
VOTES DAVID.
WILL.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES WILL, TWO
VOTES DAVID.
13th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
WILL.
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
WILL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 HAD A BLAST, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.
 THANK YOU, WILL.
 THANK YOU.
 THANKS, MAN.
 Jeff: WELL, WITH THE GAME
BEING PLAYED AT THIS LEVEL, THE
NATURAL INSTINCT IS TO WANT TO
HIDE, BUT IN ORDER TO WIN THIS
SEASON, YOU MUST BE SEEN.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 GETTING VOTED OFF OF
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT SOMETHING I
WANTED ON MY "SURVIVOR" RESUME,
BUT I AM THE YOUNGEST PERSON TO
EVER PLAY "SURVIVOR," AND TO BE
ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS IS THE
MOST AMAZING THING THAT HAS EVER
HAPPENED TO ME SO FAR IN MY
LIFE.
 THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
THAT WORKED.
THANKS A LOT.
 DUDE, ANY TIME THAT SOMEONE
TRIES TO MAKE A PLAN WITH ME,
THEY END UP GOING HOME.
I'M LIKE THE BLACK PLAGUE RIGHT
NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
I AM ALL ALONE.
I HAVE NO ALLIANCE.
BUT TRIBAL COUNCIL HAS BEEN A
COMPLETE CHAOTIC MESS EVERY
SINGLE TIME.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
SO TIME FOR THE UNDERDOG TO KEEP
FIGHTING, BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
I STILL HAVE AN IDOL.
THERE ARE STILL IMMUNITIES ON
THE WAY, AND I'M NOT GOING DOWN.
 I'M SORRY THAT I LIED TO YOU
AGAIN.
 I RESPECT YOU FULLY.
YOU AND I, LIKE IT'S HONESTLY
CRAZY.
IT'S SICK.
IT'S A SICK RELATIONSHIP.
 ME AND ADAM HAVE THIS, IT'S
KIND OF LIKE A YING YANG
RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE LOVE EACH
OTHER BUT WE HATE EACH OTHER.
THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN.
 WHAT'S YOUR GAME, ADAM, TAKE
DAVID TO THE END?
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU
OUT, DUDE.
 WELL, I HOPE NOT.
 HE ALMOST HE'S NOT TAKING YOU
TO THE END, AND YOU CAN'T BEAT
DAVID.
 I'M NOT PLANNING ON TAKING
DAVID TO THE END.
 I'M TRYING TO MAKE JAY FEEL
AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE WITH
ME, AND SO I TELL JAY THAT THE
NEXT MOVE IS TO GET RID OF DAVE,
BUT TO ME JAY HAS TO GO HOME.
 YOU HAVE AN IDOL.
 YEAH.
I'M NOT GOING HOME.
 I KNOW.
 I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE END IF I
WIN.
 HE HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERY
OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO TAKE A
STAB AT THE GUY.
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY, HE
NEEDS TO GO HOME.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
JAY, IT'S BECOMING FAMILIAR.
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: I'LL TAKE IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO SOLVE A BLOCK PUZZLE,
BUT THERE IS A TWIST.
YOU'LL HAVE A TIMER IN THE FORM
OF A "SURVIVOR" PINBALL TABLE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: YOU'RE
GOING TO ROLL YOUR BALL.
AS LONG AS THE BALL IS MAKING
ITS WAY DOWN THE TABLE, YOU CAN
WORK ON SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
WHEN THE BALL REACHES THE
BOTTOM, YOU CATCH IT, ROLL IT
AGAIN, GO BACK THE YOUR PUZZLE.
IF, HOWEVER, THE BALL DROPS
BEFORE YOU CATCH IT, THERE IS A
TIME PENALTY AS THE BALL SLOWLY
MAKES ITS WAY TO THE BOTTOM.
DURING WHICH YOU CANNOT WORK ON
YOUR PUZZLE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: SO IT BECOMES A
CHALLENGE OF SPLIT FOCUS.
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE PUZZLE
IN ORDER TO SOLVE IT, BUT YOU
ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHERE THE
BALL IS ON THE TABLE.
THE FIRST TO FINISH THEIR PUZZLE
WINS IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE
IN SIX SHOT AT WINNING THIS
GAME.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE SEVENTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
BIG STAKES, FUN CHALLENGE, LET'S
DO IT.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY, ONE IN
SIX SHOT, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
YOU GOT THE ROLL THE BALL, AND
WHILE THE BALL IS IN PLAY, YOU
CAN STARTED WORKING ON YOUR
PUZZLE.
BRET HAVING TROUBLE JUST GETTING
THE BALL UP THERE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A BIT OF A
LEARNING CURVE.
JAY IS THE FIRST TO FEEL THE
TIME PENALTY.
HE NOW CANNOT WORK ON HIS TIME
PUZZLE UNTIL THAT BALL SLOWLY
MAKES ITS WAY TO THE BOTTOM, AND
I MEAN SLOWLY.
JUST HAPPENED TO DAVID.
HE'S GOT TO WAIT.
A PUZZLE THAT WOULD NORMALLY
TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME IS
GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME.
BECAUSE YOUR FOCUS IS SPLIT.
YOU CAN ONLY THINK ABOUT THIS
PUZZLE WHILE PART OF YOUR BRAIN
IS THINKING ABOUT WHERE THAT
BALL IS.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: HANNAH JUST MISSES
HER BALL.
IT DROPS.
SHE'S GOT TO WAIT.
IF YOUR BALL DROPS, YOU GOT TO
MAKE USE OF THE TIME.
ADAM JUST MISSES.
HE CAN'T GET TO HIS BALL.
KEN DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO WAIT.
AND, OH, IT'S SO SLOW HOW THAT
BALL MAKES ITS WAY DOWN THAT
TRACK.
 THIS IS SO HARD.
 Jeff: ALL YOU CAN DO WHILE
YOUR BALL IS OUT OF PLAY IS
STUDY YOUR PUZZLE, SEE IF YOU
CAN FIGURE OUT YOUR NEXT MOVE.
DAVID'S STARTING TO MAKE SOME
PROGRESS ON HIS PUZZLE.
HANNAH MAKING SOME PROGRESS.
JAY DOING A NICE JOB WITH HIS
PUZZLE.
JAY DROPS AGAIN.
CANNOT WORK.
KEN NOW BACK AT IT.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING GOING.
DAVID WITH SOME NICE PROGRESS.
HANNAH WITH A NICE SAVE.
KEN IS VERY CLOSE.
DAVID WORKING ON HIS PUZZLE
AGAIN.
IT'S NOW DAVID IN THE LEAD.
 NO, IT'S NOT.
NO, IT'S NOT.
NO, IT'S NOT.
 Jeff: KEN OUT OF NOWHERE.
KEN THINKS HE HAS IT.
KEN IS WRONG.
KEEP GOING.
WHAT IS WRONG?
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH THIS
LOGO ALL SEASON.
KEN NOW MAKING A CHANGE.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR DAVID
AND JAY.
 KEN, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
WHEN YOUR BALL IS DROPPING.
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY TRYING TO
CATCH KEN.
DAVID DROPS.
 KEEP WORKING.
 Jeff: KEN IS STILL WRONG.
KEN GOING TO TRY TO CHANGE IT.
 KEN, COME BACK, KEN, COME
BACK, KEN, COME BACK.
 Jeff: NICE SAVE BY KEN.
 REALLY, ADAM?
 HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, HERE
WE GO.
 Jeff: DOES HE HAVE IT THIS
TIME?
 COME ON.
YES!
KEN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAME FROM THE VOTE.
HE WILL MAKE IT TO THE FINAL
SIX.
 THAT WAS FUN BY THAT WAS
CRAZY.
 THAT WAS FUN BY THAT WAS
CRAZY.
 Jeff: KEN, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, KEN.
 NICE JOB, KEN.
 APPARENTLY WHEN YOU HAVEN'T
EATEN FOR 35 DAYS, YOU CAN'T
SPELL.
 Jeff: YOU GOT IT RIGHT THE
SECOND TIME.
KEN SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
YOU WILL MAKE IT TO THE FINAL
SIX, LIVE TO SEE DAY 36.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 35
VERY TOUGH DAYS IN THIS GAME, IT
WILL COME TO AN END FOR ONE OF
YOU, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,
SOMEBODY GOING HOME, IT WON'T BE
YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 JAY IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST
CONTENDERS IN THIS GAME.
IT'S DEFINITELY A STRUGGLE TO
SIT THERE AND WATCH SOMEONE WHO
IS A YOUNGER VERSION OF MYSELF.
SO I FEEL GOOD WEARING THE IDOL
AROUND MY NECK AS OPPOSED TO
JAY.
 GREAT JOB, KEN.
 NICE JOB, KEN.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 GOOD WORK, BUDDY.
 I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T A
PUZZLE GUY.
 SIMPLES PUZZLE LIKE, THAT
YES, SLIDE PUZZLES AND ALL
THOSE, DEFINITELY NOT.
 MY BIGGEST FEAR GOING INTO
THE CHALLENGE WAS THAT JAY OR
DAVE WOULD WIN IMMUNITY.
OF COURSE, I WOULD HAVE
PREFERRED TO WIN MYSELF, BUT IF
I COULDN'T WIN, I'M GLAD IT WAS
KEN.
 I'LL GET SOME FIREWOOD.
 ADAM HELPED HIM.
HE DIDN'T WIN THAT THING.
 DUDE, I DIDN'T WANT DAVE TO
WIN.
HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND US.
YEAH, I WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING
I COULD TO HELP KEN, BECAUSE THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE IS JAY DID NOT WIN AND
DAVE DID NOT WIN.
 I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU GUYS, I'M
VOTING DAVE TONIGHT.
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME OUT
LATER, BUT LET ME STAY OVER
THESE TWO, PLEASE, GOD.
MY PLAN TONIGHT IS THAT IN THE
CASE JAY DOES PLAY HIS IDOL,
DAVE WOULD GO HOME.
 I WANT JAY TO GO HOME
TONIGHT, BUT THE SAFEST THING TO
DO... I DON'T FEEL GREAT ABOUT
THE STATE OF MY GAME AT ALL,
ESPECIALLY SINCE JAY WILL BE
AFRAID THAT WE'RE THROWING VOTES
HIS WAY, AND IF HE DOES HAVE AN
IDOL AND HE DOES PLAY IT, I
AUTOMATICALLY GO HOME.
 CAN WE JUST TELL YOU OUR
PLAN?
 OKAY.
TELL ME YOUR PLAN.
 SO OSTENSIBLY WE ARE A VOTING
BLOC OF FOUR, YOU, ME, KEN,
ADAM.
 THAT'S TRUE.
 SO THREE VOTES BRET, ONE VOTE
TO JAY AND SUNDAY, BRET AND JAY
THROW THREE VOTES AT ME.
JAY WILL, IF HE HAS AN IDOL WILL
MAY IT.
HE'LL BE SAFE.
THEN THERE'S A TIE BETWEEN BRET
AND MYSELF, AND THERE WILL BE A
REVOTE, AND THEN WE FLIP ALL THE
VOTES TO A BRET VOTE AND BRET
GOES HOME.
 SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET BRET
OUT.
WHY NOT SUNDAY, AND HERE'S WHY:
SUNDAY AT THIS POINT IS SUCH AN
ENTICING GOAT.
THE LONGER SHE'S IN THE GAME,
THE SCARIER I FEEL THAT SOMEONE
LIKE ADAM, WHO IS PLAYING REALLY
HARD WILL FLIP ON ONE OF US TO
TRY TO GO WITH SUNDAY.
 OKAY.
CAN YOU GET BEHIND THIS THEN IN.
 OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.
 IT IS IMPORTANT AT SOME POINT
TO SPLIT UP BRET AND SUNDAY.
SUNDAY'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
BECAUSE SHE'S SORT OF MADE
HERSELF INTO A TEMPTING GOAT,
AND PEOPLE COULD WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO HER.
AND I'M VERY SCARED THAT SOMEONE
WHO WORKS LESS HARD WILL GET A
SPOT THAT I'VE WORKED REALLY
HARD FOR.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT TONIGHT.
 YEAH.
 JAY IS TWO IMMUNITY WINS AWAY
FROM WINNING THIS GAME.
 YEAH.
 ALL I KNOW IS THAT I NEED TO
VOTE FOR JAY TONIGHT.
 HE'S GOING TO PLAY HIS IDOL.
 AND IF HE DOES, WHO ARE THE
OTHER THREE?
 DAVE.
 I DEFINITELY WANT TO BE
WALKING BACK HERE AFTER TRIBAL
COUNCIL WITH DAVID, WHO HAS BEEN
MY CLOSEST ALLY, MY CLOSEST
FRIEND, BUT ADAM IS AFRAID OF
DAVID, DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY
AGAINST DAVID.
 WE NEED TO VOTE FOR JAY.
WE NEED TO GET RID OF HIS IDOLS.
 I HAD A LOOK CONVERSATION
WITH KEN AND HANNAH, AND
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
CONVERSATION, I KNEW WHAT I
WANTED TO DO.
WE HAVE TO PUT ENOUGH VOTES ON
JAY THAT IF HE DOESN'T PLAY HIS
IDOL HE GOES HOME, AND WE HAVE
TO PUT ENOUGH VOTES ON DAVE THAT
IF HE DOES PLAY HIS IDOL, DAVE
GOES HOME.
 THE ONLY WAY AROUND IT IS
THIS, FOUR OF US VOTE FOR
SUNDAY, BUT THAT RISKS JAY
MOVING FORWARD WITH AN IDOL IN
HIS POCKET.
 AND IF JAY WERE TO WIN AGAIN,
WE'D BE IN BIG TROUBLE.
IF WE VOTE FOR SUNDAY, IT WOULD
LEAVE BOTH JAY AND DAVE IN THE
GAME, AND THEY'RE TWO STRONG
STRATEGIC PLAYERS, SO WE HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT ONE OF THEM GOES
HOME.
 THESE ARE THE TWO BIGGEST
THREATS.
IF JAY GOES HOME TONIGHT, THAT'S
HUGE.
HE COULD WIN EVERY IMMUNITY
GOING.
 THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING
PARTS TO TONIGHT'S VOTE, AND THE
WORSE THING WE CAN HAVE IS
TOMORROW MORNING JAY IS STILL IN
THIS GAME WITH AN IDOL IN HIS
POCKET.
 YOU'RE THE BEST PLAYER OUT
HERE.
 I NEED YOU.
 ADAM TELLING ME, I KNOW YOU
HAVE THE IDOL, I'M GOING TO
FORCE YOU TO PLAY IT, BUT ADAM
ALWAYS LIES TO ME, SO IN ALL
HONESTY, MY NAME MY NIGHT EVEN
COME UP TONIGHT, AND IF I FEEL
LIKE NOT PLAYING THE IDOL, THEN
I MIGHT JUST DO IT.
 I'M FORCING YOUR HAND.
 YES, YOU ARE.
 ADAM, JUST GET ME THERE, MAN.
PLEASE.
 I KNOW.
I KNOW IT MEANS A LOT TO YOU.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME, TOO.
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT.
 THAT'S WHY.
I CAN'T WASTE MY OPPORTUNITY.
 CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING I
HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE THIS SEASON?
 WHAT?
 MY MOM HAS STAGE FOUR LUNG
CANCER.
AND SHE'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH
THREE TREATMENTS AND I FOUND OUT
WHEN MY BROTHER CAME THEY AREN'T
WORKING.
I'M DOING THIS FOR HER.
SHE WANTS TO WATCH ME GET TO THE
END.
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T WASTE THIS
OPPORTUNITY.
MY MOM'S GOING TO DIE, BRO.
I LOVE MY MOM JUST LIKE HE DURKZ
AND IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE, LIKE, MY
MOM HAD A BRAIN ANEURYSM, ME AND
ADAM ARE BOTH OUT HERE FOR OUR
FAMILIES FOR OUR MOMS.
HE'S NOT A WEASEL IN MY BOOK
ANYMORE.
HE'S A WARRIOR.
 I THINK I MIGHT VOTE FOR
SUNDAY.
 OH, I HATE YOU.
 OKAY.
HERE'S WHY.
EVEN IF JAY GETS THROUGH, IF
SUNDAY GOES HOME AND LEAVES JUST
US, WE HAVE A MORE LOYAL FOUR.
 I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
 WHY NOT?
 BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE
TWO OF THEM HAVE TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE THEY'RE HUGE THREATS
IN THIS GAME.
 ADAM'S RELUCTANCE TO VOTE OUT
SUNDAY IS MY RELUCTANCE, TOO,
BECAUSE IT LEAVES A VISIBLE
THREAT IN THE GAME, WHICH IS
DAVID.
THE PROBLEM IS IF JAY PLAYS HIS
IDOL AND DAVID GOES HOME, I LOSE
DAVID, WHO I FRICKEN LOVE, SO I
DON'T KNOW IF RIGHT CHOICE, BUT
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT MAKES A
DECISION AND CONVINCES OTHER
PEOPLE OF THAT DECISION IS THE
KIND OF PERSON THAT WINS
"SURVIVOR."
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS,
JESSICA, ZEKE, AND WILL VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO, DAVID, RIGHT NOW IN THE
GAME, DO FRIENDSHIPS AND
ALLIANCES REALLY MATTER, OR IS
IT EVERYBODY FOR THEMSELVES AND
ALL BETS ARE OFF?
 I ACTUALLY THINK YOU HAVE TO
LEAN ON FRIENDSHIPS AND BONDS,
EVEN MORE THAN AT THE BEGINNING
OR MIDDLE OF THE GAME.
I THINK THEY'RE INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT.
 Jeff: JAY, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT?
DO BONDS HAVE CURRENCY?
 YES, YOU ARE RELYING ON
ALLIANCES, WHICH, YOU KNOW, I
DON'T SEE ANY OF MINE SITTING
HERE ANYMORE, BUT...
 Jeff: JAY, IS THAT WHERE
YOU FEEL PRESSURE?
YOU'RE CLEARLY A THREAT AND
TONIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE THE
PROTECTION OF A NECKLACE.
 HONESTLY, JEFF, A CHALLENGE
THREAT IS A BIG DEAL, BUT IF YOU
HAVE IS A CHALLENGE THREAT WITH
AN ALLIANCE, WHAT'S WIGER, THE
GUY WHO IS ALONE OR THE GUY WHO
HAS FRIENDS THAT HAVE HIS BACK?
 Jeff: BRET, WHAT IS JAY
SAYING?
 JAY'S SAYING HE WISHES HE HAD
THAT NECKLACE AROUND HIS NECK.
 DAMN RIGHT.
 BECAUSE HE'S VERY SCARED
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: DAVID, JAY IS SAYING,
I'M JUST ONE GUY, BUT THAT ALL
DEPENDS ON PERSPECTIVE.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER TERM
YOU COULD USE WOULD BE A FREE
AGENT, AND SO IF THERE ARE
PEOPLE LOOKING TO MAKE A MOVE,
YOU CAN EXPLOIT SOMEONE LIKE A
FREE AGENT.
 Jeff: YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF
HEAT, DAVID.
 I HAVE.
 Jeff: FOR SEVERAL TRIBALS
PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU'RE A
LEGITIMATE THREAT TO WIN THIS
GAME AND WE HAVE TO TAKE YOU
OUT, AND YET HERE YOU STILL SIT.
 YES.
YES, I DO.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE
TRUE AFTER TONIGHT.
BUT, YES, I'VE RELIED HEAVILY ON
FRIENDSHIPS AND ALLIANCES TO
STILL BE SITTING HERE.
 Jeff: ADAM, YOU SEEM TO
HAVE A REACTION TO THAT.
IS DAVID RIGHT OR WRONG IN.
 YEAH, DAVE AND THE MAJORITY
EVERY VOTE HAS IMPRESSED PEOPLE
WITH HIS WORK AROUND CAMP, WITH
HIS TRANSFORMATION, AND THAT'S
WHAT JURIES LOVE TO ROOT FOR.
 Jeff: HANNAH, WE KEEP
COMING BACK TO THIS WHOLE
CONUNDRUM, WHO TO GET RID OF,
WHO TO TAKE, BASED ON WHAT WE
THINK THE JURY WILL THINK.
 YEAH, A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAS
BEEN AROUND WHO ARE THE THREATS
TO WIN AT THE END.
BECAUSE I THINK EVERY SINGLE PEN
HERE HAS ALREADY WRITTEN THEIR
FINAL SPEECH.
AND THAT'S BEEN A MAIN POINT OF
DISCUSSION FOR ALL OF US.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS THOUGHT OF YOU RIGHT
NOW?
ARE YOU SOMEBODY THAT THEY
SHOULD TAKE TO THE END OR ARE
YOU A THREAT TO GET RID OF
TONIGHT?
 OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT A PHYSICAL
THREAT, SO I THINK I'M A PERSON
THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING, OH,
I'LL JUST TAKE HER TO THE END.
 Jeff: MEANING YOU CAN'T GET
ANY VOTES?
 I THINK I CAN GET VOTES, BUT
I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
THINK THAT I CAN'T GET VOTES, SO
I THINK I'M A LITTLE
UNDERESTIMATED.
 Jeff: ADAM, IF THE
PERCEPTION OF SUNDAY IS TRUE, IT
WORKS TO SUNDAY'S ADVANTAGE.
SUDDENLY IT'S LIKE, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TAKE ME TO THE END AND
MAYBE I CAN STILL BEAT YOU EVEN
THOUGH YOU CLEARLY HAVE NO
CONFIDENCE IN ME.
 THE REALITY IS EVERYONE IN
THIS GROUP RIGHT NOW HAS BEEN
PLAYING THEIR OWN GAME.
IT'S JUST MATTER OF WHAT IS THE
PERCEPTION OF THE JURY, AND
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DECIDING WHO
YOU WANT TO SIT NEXT TO AT THE
END.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SUNDAY, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 ALL RIGHT.
I'D RATHER BE SAFE THAN SORRY,
JEFF.
 Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JAY WILL NOT
COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, JAY.
DOES NOT COUNT.
DAVID.
ONE VOTE DAVID.
DAVID.
TWO VOTES DAVID.
SUNDAY.
TWO VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE
SUNDAY.
SUNDAY.
TWO VOTES DAVID, TWO VOTES
SUNDAY.
SUNDAY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES SUNDAY, TWO
VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE LEFT.
 I KNEW IT.
I DIDN'T HAVE TO USE IT.
 Jeff: 14th PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY, SUNDAY, YOU NEED TO
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
SUNDAY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
HAVE FUN.
 THANKS, SUNDAY.
 TAKE CARE.
 Jeff: WELL, 35 DAYS AGO WE
BEGAN THIS SEASON MILLENNIALS
VERSUS GEN X.
SO IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT THERE
ARE THREE MILLENNIALS, THREE GEN
X AS WE BEGIN THE BATTLE TO THE
FINISH.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," SIX ARE LEFT, AND
THE GAME IS STILL UP IN THE AIR.
 IF I HAVE TO DO DIRTY TRICKS
LIKE, THIS THEN SO BE IT.
 AN IDOL CAN SCREW EVERYTHING
UP.
 I HAVE THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN STORE FOR
ME?
 WHO WILL OUTLAST ALL IF
OTHERS?
 Jeff: EVERY PERSON HERE IS
A LEGITIMATE THREAT TO WIN THIS
GAME AND CLAIM THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR.
JOIN US FOR THE TWO-HOUR SEASON
FINALE
 HAVING TO GO HOME THIS CLOSE
TO THE FINISH IS GUT WRENCHING
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE FINISH
LINE.
I KNOW MY FAMILY WILL BE BEYOND
PROUD.
I SLEPT IN THE DIRT FOR 30 DAYS.
I'VE DONE CHALLENGES AND JUMPED
OFF THINGS I NEVER WOULD HAVE
DONE.
I'M LEAVING FEELING SO PROUD OF
MYSELF AND I HAVE ZERO REGRETS
ABOUT IT.
