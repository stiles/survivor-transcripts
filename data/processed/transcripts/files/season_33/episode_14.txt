 --- 

         IT'S BEEN MY DREAM SINCE I
WAS NINE YEARS OLD TO PLAY THIS
GAME AND HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE.
THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF.
I FEEL LIKE I'M INSIDE MY
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS.
AND I'M PLAYING FOR SO MUCH MORE
THAN THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
MOM, THIS IS FOR YOU.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
MY MOM TOLD ME RIGHT BEFORE I
CAME OUT HERE, YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING THAT YOU SET YOUR MIND
TO.
 Jeff: ADAM WINS!








 I SET MY MIND TO ONE GOAL,
WINNING THIS GAME.
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS TO
ADAM ON WINNING THE 33rd
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR," HUGE
ACHIEVE.
BEFORE WE GET INTO YOUR STORY,
GLEN, GIVE US ONE SHOT.
I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO ALL OF
YOU GUYS.
WHAT A SEASON.
THESE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT
MADE ONE OF OUR BEST SEASONS
POSSIBLE.
REALLY GREAT JOB.
[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
SO, ADAM, OBVIOUSLY WE TALKED
ALLOTTED, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
GREAT GAME PLAY.








YOU HAD TO MAKE SOME RISKY MOVES
AND SOME GOOD MANEUVERS TO GET
THERE, BUT THE FOUNDATION OF
YOUR GAME IS WHAT MADE IT SO
UNIQUE, AND IT WAS YOUR PURPOSE
FOR PLAYING, WHICH WAS YOUR MOM.
 MY MOM AND I AND MY WHOLE
FAMILY HAVE BEEN HUGE, HUGE
"SURVIVOR" FANS, AND EVEN JUST
TO BE IN THIS THEATER RIGHT NOW
WOULD HAVE BEEN A DREAM COME
TRUE, LET ALONE TO PLAY THE
GAME, LET ALONE TO WIN THE GAME.
AND, SO YOU KNOW, MY MOM AND I
ALMOST GOT ON THE "BLOOD VERSUS
WATER" SEASON TOGETHER.
SO WHEN I GOT THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO POTENTIALLY GO OUT AND WIN
THIS GAME, THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN
HER MIND WHAT I SHOULD DO.
AND MY MOM WAS THE HEALTHIEST
PERSON YOU COULD POSSIBLY
IMAGINE.
 Jeff: HERE'S WHAT I FOUND
REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT YOUR
CONNECTION IS THAT WE WANTED YOU
ON THE SHOW, TOLD YOU, THAT AND
THEN YOU FOUND OUT YOUR MOM WAS
SICK, AND I SAID, LOOK, THIS IS
A BIG DEAL, WE'LL BRING YOU BACK
NEXT YEAR IF YOU WANT, JUST DO
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT, AND
THAT'S WHEN THE STORY REALLY
TURNED WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR MOM
THAT AND SHE SAID, YOU GOT TO
GO.
 MY MOM LIVED AT 100%.
SHE ALWAYS WAS DANCING AND
SMILING AND LAUGHING AND LOVING,
AND WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE IS IN
FRONT OF YOU, SHE WOULD HAVE
NEVER PASSED IT UP.
AND SHE WANTED THE SAME FOR ME.
AND SO I TALKED TO MY MOM, AND I
TALKED TO MY DAD, AND I TALKED
TO MY BROTHER ABOUT IT.
AND I SAID, IF NOW IS NOT THE
RIGHT TIME, WE CAN DO THIS
LATER, AND MY MOM SAID, YOU HAVE
TO GO NOW.
AND WE NEEDED SOMETHING TO LOOK
FORWARD TO, SOMETHING TO
BRIGHTEN HER SPIRITS.
 Jeff: AND DO YOU THINK...
COULD YOU FEEL... DID YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU COULD CONNECT WITH YOU
WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE EVEN
THOUGH THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION?
 THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THE
ENTIRE THING IS NOT THE FOOD,
IT'S NOT THE SLEEP, FOR ME IT
WAS BEING AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,
AND YET THERE WAS THIS ENERGY
THAT I KNOW THAT SHE WAS SENDING
ME FROM HOME.
I KNOW BECAUSE OF WHO SHE WAS,
AND I KNOW BECAUSE SHE RECORDED
VIDEOS FOR ME WHILE I WAS AWAY
THAT I COULD WATCH.
FOR HER TO LIVE MY EXPERIENCE
RIGHT ALONG WITH ME, AND WHEN I
FOUND THOSE IDOLS AND WHEN I WON
IMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN MY
BROTHER CAME OUT THERE, SHE WAS
WITH ME.
AND SHE'S WITH ME TONIGHT.
 Jeff: BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.
[APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A REALLY
INTERESTING MOMENT, AND I GOT
ASKED ABOUT THIS AS MUCH AS
ANYTHING OUT THERE, WHICH WAS
WHEN YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO TELL
SOMEBODY, YOU TELL YOUR
ADVERSARY IN THE GAME, JAY, AND
I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND, IN
FACT, WE GOT A TWEET THAT
REPRESENTED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
ASKED THAT, WHY DID YOU FINALLY
OPEN UP?
JAY, I WANT TO ASK YOU, WHY DO
YOU THINK ADAM CAME TO YOU?
 ME AND HIM HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
FOREVER, YOU KNOW, BUT WE'RE
LIKE BROTHERS, AND I THINK HE
JUST NEEDED AN OUTLET ON THE
ISLAND, AND I THINK HE RESPECTED
ME SO MUCH, EVEN THOUGH HE HATED
ME AT THE SAME TIME.
WE'RE MESSED UP.
IT'S THE MOST DYSFUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER BEEN IN.
SO I LOVE HIM, SO I SHOWED HIM
RESPECT, SO HE CAME OUT THERE
AND, YO, DUDE, I LOVE YOU, AND I
GOT TO TELL SOMEONE THIS BECAUSE
IT'S KILLING ME.
 SO IT MADE SENSE TO YOU?
 Jeff: I KNEW HE WAS DOING
THAT FOR HIS MOM, AS WELL, AND
HIS FAMILY.
 DREW: SO ADAM, OKAY, YOU
SPEND 39 DAYS OUT THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
BACK HOME.
YOU CAN'T EVEN CALL WHEN THE
GAME IS OVER.
YOU HAVE TO GET ON A PLANE AND
FLY HOME.
YOU HAVE YOUR REUNION WITH YOUR
MOM.
WALK US THROUGH THAT.
 SO I GET ON THE ABSOLUTE
FIRST FLIGHT I CAN FROM L.A.
BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE I
JUST NEED TO BE HOME.
I CAN FEEL HER CALLING ME HOME.
AND MY MOM HAD TWO DAYS BEFORE
DURING FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
PROBABLY, MY MOM WAS WALKING
AROUND THE BLOCK AND SHE WAS
THRIVING STILL, AND I GOT HOME
AND I WAS ABLE TO TELL HER, I
SAID, MOM, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
AND SHE WAS THERE WITH ME.
SHE WAS.
AND SHE SAID, I LOVE YOU.
I SAID, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU.
SHE SAID, DON'T STOP SAYING
THAT.
MY DAD AND MY BROTHER, WE WERE
ALL SAYING IT.
AND SHE DIED AN HOUR AFTER I GOT
HOME.
AND I NEEDED HER TO KNOW, AND I
DON'T KNOW IF SHE HEARD ME, BUT
I... OH, GOD, THIS IS... THIS IS
CRAZY BECAUSE MY LIFE, RIGHT
LIKE, IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL
STORY, LIKE I CAN GET THAT
LOOKING OUTSIDE OF IT, THIS IS
MY LIFE.
AND IT'S REAL, AND I TOLD HER I
WON.
 Jeff: SO YOU KNEW?
YOU HAD A SENSE?
DO YOU THINK SHE HEARD YOU?
 I DON'T KNOW HONESTLY, BUT IT
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 HER SPIRIT.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE SHE
KNEW.
THAT'S WHAT MOMS DO.
SHE KNEW.
SHE ABSOLUTELY KNEW.
 Jeff: THAT'S AWESOME.
WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT TO
THIS STORY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOU, AND THAT IS THAT ADAM'S
MOM PASSED FROM LUNG CANCER,
EVEN THOUGH SHE NEVER SMOKED,
WAS AN EXERCISE ENTHUSIAST, ATE
HEALTHY, SO THERE'S CLEARLY
RESEARCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING,
AND TO HONOR HIS MOM, ADAM HAS
PARTNERED WITH STAND UP TO
CANCER TO RAISE MONEY
SPECIFICALLY TO FUND RESEARCH
FOR LUNG CANCER, AND VERY COOL,
BRISTOL MYERS SQUIB COMPANY,
WHICH IS A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF
STAND UP TO CANCER, HAS OFFERED
THEY'RE MATCHING DONATIONS FOR
ADAM'S EFFORTS TO RAISE MONEY UP
TO A TOTAL OF $100,000.
SO IT'S AN AMAZING GESTURE THAT
WILL HOPEFULLY INSPIRE PEOPLE
TONIGHT TO WANT TO GIVE.
IN FACT, WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE
WEB SITE UP NOW.
IF YOU'RE INSPIRED BY THIS, YOU
CAN GO TO THE WEB SITE AND GIVE
NOW, A REALLY COOL TRIBUTE.
YES?
 I HAVE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE.
I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN SIX
MONTHS AGO ASKING PEOPLE TO
CONTRIBUTE THE LUNG CANCER
RESEARCH.
I WANT TO BE A PART OF IT
MYSELF.
I WANT TO DONATE THE $100,000 OF
MY WINNINGS TO THIS CAUSE.
 Jeff: WOW.
 AND I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE WILL
BE SAME.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE KICKING IT
OFF WITH $100,000, AND WE HAVE
MATCHLING SPONSOR FOR ANOTHER
$100,000.
ADAM, HONESTLY, THANK YOU TO YOU
AND YOU FAMILY FOR SHARING THIS
JOURNEY.
I'M SURE IT TOUCHED A LOT OF
FAMILIES AND I'M GLAD YOU WERE
PART OF IT.
 AND THANKS TO ALL OF YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
 Jeff: AND EVEN THOUGH THIS
IS A SOMEWHAT AWKWARD TRANSITION
TO MAKE, ADAM'S STORY REALLY
DOES SPEAK TO THE BIGGEST THEME
OF THIS SEASON, WHICH IS
POWERFUL PERSONAL STORIES WHERE
PEOPLE LIKE DAVID DISCOVERED
WHAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF.
TAKE A LOOK.
 MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE HAD THIS
FEAR OF DEATH.
WHOA.
SPIDERS.
BUT OVER THE YEARS IT MORPHED
INTO A FEAR OF LIFE.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
HE LIVES A FEARLESS LIFE.
I WANT TO WALK OUT AS THE MAN MY
FATHER WAS.
I'M GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.
 IMMUNITY IDOL.
GOOD WORK.
 I'M JUST TRYING THE TAMPER
DOWN THAT VOICE THAT SAYS I
CAN'T.
 Jeff: DAVID WINS IMMUNITY.
 WAY TO GO, DAVID.
 THE PENNY EXPERIENCE CAN GIVE
ME THAT POWER.
YES!
IT'S "SURVIVOR."
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: DAVID, YOU WENT
FROM... MOST OF MY FRIENDS SAID,
OH, THAT GUY IS FIRST OFF, AND
ALL OF MY WRITER FRIENDS SAID,
YOU FINALLY PUT A WRITER ON THE
SHOW AND THIS IS THE GUY YOU PUT
ON?
BUT YOU TRANSFORMED INTO A
KINGPIN.
YOU WERE A POWER PLAYER.
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?
SUM IT UP IN A NUTSHELL THE
TRANSFORMATION?
 I JUST GOT OUT THERE AND I
GOT INTO THE GAME, AND I JUST
HAD THIS VICE IN MY HEAD THAT
WAS TELLING ME THAT NO ONE LIKES
YOU.
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.
AND THEN I'M SURROUNDED BY THESE
PEOPLE AND THEY SHOW ME SUCH
LOVE AND SUPPORT, AND I REALIZE
THEY REALLY DO LIKE ME, AND THE
IRONY IS THAT'S WHAT MADE ME
SUCH A BIG THREAT.
 Jeff: SO DO YOU HEAR FROM
PEOPLE?
ARE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS
SAYING, I RELATED TO THAT?
 PEOPLE HAVE REACHED OUT WITH
THEIR OWN ISSUES WITH ANXIETY
AND THEY'VE BEEN CHEERING ME ON
AND BEING SUPER SUPPORTIVE AND
RELATING TO IT.
IF I CAN MAKE THEM FEEL A LITTLE
LESS UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT'S
AWESOME.
 Jeff: I LOVE THAT.
RIGHT BEHIND YOU ZEKE ALMOST AN
EQUALLY POWERFUL STORY STARTED
OUT AND SAID, I'M THE MILLENNIAL
NERD, I DON'T FIT IN.
YOU STARTED MAKING FIRE AND
EVERYTHING HAPPENED AND YOU
TRANSFORMED.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR
JOURNEY.
 I WILLIVE IN BROOKLYN.
I KNOW HOW TO RIDE THE SUBWAY
AND THAT'S THE EXTENT OF MY
OUTDOORSY SKILLS.
I'M THE DOUGHY LITTLE GAY GUY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T BELIEVE I
COULD HACK IT OUT HERE.
HI.
HI.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BUT AGAINST ALL ODDS -- FIRE,
FIRE -- I'M REACHING MY
POTENTIAL.
TRIBAL WAS AMAZING.
I FEEL LIKE I'M MY BEST VERSION
OF MYSELF OUT HERE.
TODAY I AM A WARRIOR.
 THIS IS MY HERO.
THIS IS THE STRONG PERSON I LOOK
UP TO AND I MODEL MY BEHAVIOR
AFTER.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ZEKE, WHAT I WONDERED
ABOUT WITH YOU, WHEREAS WITH
DAVID I FELT HIM SORT OF
STUMBLING AND STRUGGLING TO
FIGURE OUT, YOU SEEMED TO BE
REALIZING, I'M POWERFUL.
I CAN DO THIS.
COULD YOU FEEL THAT HAPPENING?
 I THINK I COULD.
GOSH, I GOT BLINDSIDED
IMMEDIATELY AND KNEW I HAD MAJOR
WORK TO DO, AND RUNG BY RUNG I
PULLED MYSELF UP FROM THE BOTTOM
TO THE MOST POWERFUL POSITION IN
THE GAME.
AND AFTER A COUPLE ALLIES
DESERTED TO ME, I HAD TO
CONVINCE FOUR PEOPLE I
PREVIOUSLY BLIND SIDED TO STICK
THEIR HAND IN A BAG OF ROCKS FOR
ME, FOR ME THAT'S THE HIGHLIGHT
OF MY EXPERIENCE, TO CONVINCE
FOUR PEOPLE I BLINDSIDED TO
STICK THEIR HAND IN A BAG OF
ROCKS FOR ME.
 Jeff: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
"SURVIVOR"?
 YOU'RE NOT GIVEN MANY
OPPORTUNITIES TO TEST YOU'RE.
THE DOWN SIDE IS IF YOU DON'T
TEST YOURSELF, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.
I THINK I'VE UNDERVALUED MYSELF
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE.
AND "SURVIVOR" ALLOWED ME TO
DISCOVER THAT I'M MUCH STRONGER
THAN I EVER POSSIBLY COULD
IMAGINE.
 Jeff: AMEN.
NICE.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK.
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I THINK
IT WAS THE MOMENT OF THE SEASON,
AND IT WAS WHEN BRET CONFIDED IN
ZEKE.
I WANT TO SEE THAT MOMENT, AND I
WANT THE FIND OUT WHY ZEKE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: WELL, WHEN YOU DO A
SEASON LIKE THIS WHERE YOU PIT
TWO CULTURES AGAINST EACH OTHER,
WHAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR IS TO BE
SURPRISED BY THAT CLASH OF
CULTURE IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY, AND
WE'VE GOT IT WHEN BRET, THE
TOUGH GEN X BOSTON COP AND ZEKE,
THE SELF-DESCRIBED MILLENNIAL
NERD, PROVIDED WHAT I THINK WAS
THE MOMENT OF THE SEASON.
 WELL, I WILL TELL YOU YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY GAY GUY OUT HERE.
 YOU?
 SHHH.
I'M PLAYING A GAME HERE.
I DIDN'T GROW UP IN A TIME WHEN
IT WAS NORMAL TO TALK ABOUT
BEING GAY.
I'M HOPING FROM HERE ON OUT I
CAN BE THAT WAY, YOU KNOW?
I'M A DIFFERENT GENERATION.
 I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT.
I OWE A LOT TO BRET'S
GENERATION.
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
COME OUT AT 15 WERE IT NOT FOR
THE PIONEERS THAT PAVED THE WAY.
I THINK THAT REALLY REFLECTS
THIS MILLENNIAL-GEN X DIVIDE.
CHEERS, BROTHER.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: BRET, I HAPPEN TO
HAVE A BUNCH OF FRIENDS OVER
THAT NIGHT TO THE HOUSE TO WATCH
THAT NIGHT OF "SURVIVOR," AND,
YEAH, THAT APPLAUSE, MY FRIENDS
WENT, OH, MY GOD, THAT'S THE
MOST AMAZING THING I'VE EVER
SEEN.
SO THE SAME QUESTION I HAVE FOR
ADAM AND JAY, WHY DID YOU PICK
ZEKE?
 YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, SEEING
ZEKE IN HIS FAVORITE SHIRTS, I
SAID, I'M NEVER GOING TO
IDENTIFY WITH THIS GUY.
I NEVER TALKED TO ZEKE UNTIL
AFTER THE MERGE.
ONCE WE MERGED, WE STARTED
HAVING SMALL CONVERSATIONS,
STARTED LEAVING TO LARGER
CONVERSATIONS.
HE'S REALLY A FUN GUY TO TALK
WITH.
WE HAD SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS
OUT THERE.
THEN WE HAD A COUPLE NICE
REWARDS.
WE HAD THE BEERS GOING AND WE'RE
JUMPING OFF FLOATING PIZZA
PLACES.
IT WAS... WE JUST STARTED TO
FORM A BOND.
 Jeff: YOU FELT SAFE?
 I FELT SAFE AND I WANTED TO
SOLIDIFY THE BOND AND SAY, I
KNOW THE STRUGGLES YOU WENT
THROUGH, I WENT THROUGH THEM
TOO.
 Jeff: VERY COOL.
IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT, AND WE
HAD ALLOTTED, AGAIN, WE HAD SO
MANY PEOPLE ASKING THE SAME
QUESTION, JOYCE STEVENS TWEETED
AT ME, HAD YOU COME OUT TO
PEOPLE BEFORE?
 YEAH, SINCE MY MID-30s I
STARTED TELLING CLOSE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.
AND I THINK 35 YEARS OLD, THE
RUMORS WERE GETTING OUT.
ONE OF MY BUDDIES AT WORK CALLED
IT THE WORST-KEPT SECRET AT THE
BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.
BUT I STARTED TO KIND OF TELL
PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME, JUST TO LET
PEOPLE KNOW.
 Jeff: HAVE YOU HAD PEOPLE
COME IT UP TO YOU AND SAY, THANK
YOU BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT DOING THE SAME THING.
 A YOUNG KID IN HIS 20s THAT
I WAS FRIENDS WITH, I KNEW THE
FAMILY.
HE SAID, HEY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO, I'M SCARED, WHAT'S GOING
ON.
SO IT'S BEEN GREAT.
YOU KNOW?
 Jeff: CHANGING LIVES.
 WELL, LISTEN...
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, THERE WAS ANOTHER GREAT
MOMENT THIS SEASON, EQUALLY
COMPELLING, IT WAS ON THE BEACH
WITH HANNAH AND KEN.
 I DO FLIRT WITH KEN, BUT YOU
LOOK AT KEN AND YOU'RE LIKE, KEN
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF CRUSH
ON ME, BECAUSE LOOK AT HIM.
 JUST THE FIRST FEW SECONDS
TODAY, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SUN.
 YOU CAN, YOU TOLD ME THAT.
 IT DOESN'T HURT YOUR EYES.
 BUT JUST MAYBE, YEAH, KEN AND
I, YEAH, NO, YEAH, I COULD... I
COULD SEE THAT.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: IF ONLY WE HAD A
CAMERA ON HANNAH WHILE SHE WAS
WATCHING THAT GOING, THIS IS,
OH, MY GOD, SO WEIRD.
HANNAH, THAT TO ME, THE REASON I
LOVE THAT MOMENT IS THAT IT
REALLY CAPTURED YOUR SPIRIT,
WHICH WAS YOU HAVE INSECURITIES,
YOU GOT NERVOUS JUST WATCHING A
CHALLENGE, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE,
YOU JUST LET IT FLY, AND AS A
RESULT, PEOPLE REALLY RELATED TO
YOU.
WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER ABOUT
YOURSELF EITHER THROUGH THE
PROCESS OR THROUGH PEOPLE COMING
UP SAYING, I DIG YOU SO MUCH?
 YEAH, I DEFINITELY FEEL
BOLDER AND MORE SELF-ASSURED
THAN THE FIRST TIME I VOTED OR
WHEN I STARTED THIS GAME.
I THINK THAT FOR ME IT WASN'T
ABOUT CONQUERING MY ANXIETY BUT
LEARNING TO FIND PEOPLE I COULD
OPEN UP TO AND TO PUSH THROUGH
AND IT'S WEIRD WASHING IT BACK.
I WAS VERY VULNERABLE ON TV, AND
I WAS VERY SCARED, BUT I'VE HAD
SO MANY PEOPLE REACHING OUT AND
TELL ME THAT THEY TOO HAVE
EXPERIENCED ANXIETY AND PANIC
ATTACKS AND NOT ONLY DID THAT
MAKE ME FEEL NOT ALONE IN THIS
WHOLE THING, BUT I REALLY FEEL
LIKE IF I CAN HELP OR WE CAN
HELP ONE PERSON WITH ANXIETY GO
TO THE JOB THEY WANT OR GO ON A
DATE WITH SOMEBODY REALLY
HANDSOME, YOU KNOW, THEN THEY
SHOULD DO THAT.
 Jeff: SPEAKING OF WHICH,
THIS IS ALSO A THEME IN THE
TWEETS.
KRISTIN MOORE SAYS, "HANNAH'S
ABILITY TO FLIRT WITH A HOTTIE
IS EVERY GOAL I'VE EVER HAD."
YOU ARE A FLIRT.
 I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS GROUP OF
PEOPLE.
YOU HAD THESE BOYS WITH THEIR
SHIRTS OFF AND, I WAS JUST... I
WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO BE WEIRD
AND FLIRT WITH THE PRETTIEST
FACE ON THE ISLAND AND JUST SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: KEN, WHAT IS REALLY
AMAZING, JUST AS WE WERE
WATCHING THIS FINALE, I WAS
WATCHING IT BACK STAGE WITH ONE
OF MY BUDDY, WE GET TO YOU.
HERE YOU ARE, THIS GUY WHO CAN
FISH, YOU WON FOUR CHALLENGE,
YOU CAN BUILD A SHELTER,
RIDICULOUSLY HANDSOME, AGREED,
AND YOU'RE PLAYING FOR YOUR
DAUGHTER, AND YET YOU HAVE YOUR
OWN ACHILLES HEEL, AND IT'S NOT
DISSIMILAR TO MOST OF THESE
PEOPLE'S, SOCIAL ANXIETY.
DID THIS EXPERIENCE HELP YOU AT
ALL?
 ABSOLUTELY.
I SPEND EVERY WEEK DEDICATING MY
TIME TO DENVER WHO ARE HOMELESS.
YOU LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE, DON'T
JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT SOMEONE HAS
GONE THROUGH.
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND JUDGE AND
ASSUME ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
THINGS, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT MY SPEECHISM PEND.
, MY NERVOUS TWITCH, WHAT I WENT
THROUGH AS A KID AND THE
EMOTIONAL DISTRESS I WAS UNDER
FOR THE FIRST 25 YEARS OF MY
LIFE.
I MAY LOOK ONE WAY, BUT PUT ME
IN A ROOM OF FIVE PEOPLE OR 500
PEOPLE AND I'M THE WALLFLOWER.
THIS HELPED ME THE RISE ABOVE
THAT.
 Jeff: AND LET'S ANSWER THE
THE BIG QUESTION: YES OR NO,
SINGLE?
 UH...
 Jeff: IT'S COMPLICATED?
 VERY MUCH SO.
 Jeff: GLEN, GET A SHOT OF
MICHAELA, SHE'S NEXT.
ONE OF THE MOST ELECTRIC,
COMBUSTIBLE AND ABSOLUTELY
ENTERTAINING WOMEN OF THE
SEASON.
WE'LL TALK TO HER AFTER THIS.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK
"SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VS. GEN
X" LIVE REUNION SHOW.
MICHAELA, HERE'S MY TAKE ON YOU.
YOU WERE DOMINATING IN
CHALLENGES.
YOU SPOKE YOUR MILD AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU
REALIZED WHAT A GOOD PLAYER YOU
WERE UNTIL YOU REVEALED YOUR
STRATEGY AND THEN JAY AND WILL
TOOK YOU OUT.
IS THAT TRUE?
IS THAT WHEN YOU WENT, MAYBE I
AM A FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK.
 THAT'S 100% TRUE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BIG OF A
DETRIMENT THAT SEASHELL THING
WAS MY GAME UNTIL I SAW IT ON
TV.
SO IT NEVER ONCE DONNED ON ME
THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY, OH,
MICHAELA IS THINKING AHEAD.
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING, MICHAELA
IS THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS
WITH ME.
 Jeff: YOU WERE THINKING
LOYALTY?
 YEAH, BUT THIS ISN'T A LOYAL
CREW.
 Jeff: THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO
WAS LOYAL.
JESSICA, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT
MOMENT.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN
WHERE WE GO TO ROCKS AND
SOMEBODY DRAWS.
DID YOU REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER
MOVE?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING IN THAT
MOMENT?
 I HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS.
BASICALLY I MADE THE RIGHT
CHOICE.
I PICKED THE WRONG ROCK.
THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO.
 Jeff: YEAH.
 THIS WAS A GAME, THANK YOU,
THIS WAS A GAME WHERE LOYALTY
REALLY MATTERED SO MUCH.
AND HOW COULD I TURN MY BACK ON
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE?
I MEAN, THE GUY THAT SAVED ME.
 Jeff: YOUR POINT IS THAT...
WHAT I WAS TELLING PEOPLE WAS IF
YOU SAY, ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT
GOING TO DRAW ROCK, YOU'VE JUST
LOST VOTES.
 I WAS BEING TRUE TO PEOPLE
WHO WERE TRUE TO ME.
ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WAS NO
LOVE.
SO REALLY I'M GOING TO TURN MY
BECOME ON THOSE THAT MATTER?
 Jeff: IS THAT ROCK ON YOUR
MANTLE?
I'M KIDDING.
IF I WERE IN THE FINAL THREE, I
WOULD HAVE LOST THE FINAL GAME.
IT WORKED OUT FOR ADAM.
HE PUT HIS HAND IN THAT BAG OF
ROCKS, TOO, AND HE'S SITTING
HERE A WINNER.
 Jeff: GOOD POINT.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THOSE CHANCES.
WILL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL KID TO
PLAY THIS GAME.
THAT'S AWESOME.
YOU SPEAK TO OTHER YOUNG
TEENAGERS, YOUNG KIDS THAT I
MEET ALL THE TIME BECAUSE NOW
THEY CAN ASPIRE AND SAY, I WANT
TO BE LIKE THE GUY, WILL, BUT
YOU ALSO SPEAK TO PARENTS WHO
HAD TO CONTEMPLATE, WOW, WOULD I
LET MY KID IN HIGH SCHOOL,
CYCLONE, NOT EATING, PLAYING
WITH ADULT, BIG PSYCHOLOGICAL
THINGS HAPPENING.
WAS IT AN EASY SELL TO YOUR
FOLKS?
 NOT AT ALL, NO.
I THINK MY DAD TRIED TO KEEP IT
TOGETHER MORE, BUT I THINK THEY
BOTH REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THE
DECISION TO LET ME GO ON THIS
SHOW WHERE I AM DOING ALL THESE
CRAZY THINGS LIKE SURVIVING
CYCLONES AND EATING BUGS, YOU
KNOW, IT'S JUST ALL THESE CRAZY
THINGS.
AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY A TOUGH
THING TO SELL.
THE WAY I SOLD IT WAS BY TELLING
THEM I'M PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO
GET ON THE SHOW.
I'M GOING TO APPLY.
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET ON.
NEXT THING I KNOW I AM ON, AND,
YOU KNOW...
 Jeff: THEY'RE COMMITTED.
 I HAD TO GO.
 Jeff: NICE WORK.
YOU HELD YOURSELF WELL.
YOU WERE A GREAT FIRST
REPRESENTATIVE FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
 THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: SUNDAY, I WANT TO ASK
YOU SOMETHING THAT I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'VE EVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT.
WE ALWAYS HAVE SO MANY MOM, YOU,
JESSICA, CeCe, LUCY, WHAT IS
THE MESSAGE TO MOMS WHO HAVE SO
MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO BE A
PARENT, TO BE A WIFE AND ALL
THESE OTHER THINGS BUT STILL
HAVE SOME ADVENTURE THEY'RE
SEEKING?
 THAT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO
GO FOR YOUR DREAMS.
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO FIND OUT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
YOU CAN BE SO WRAPPED UP IN
BEING A MOM THAT THAT BECOMES
YOUR COMPLETE IDENTITY OR
CAREER, AND THERE'S ALWAYS STILL
SOME OF YOU LEFT TO FINE.
TAKE THE STEP, GO FOR THE DREAM
AND FIND YOURSELF AGAIN.
 Jeff: NICE.
I LOVE THAT.
I GOT TO ASK.
TAYLOR AND FIGGY, SO IN TRUE
MILLENNIAL FASHION, I HONOR THE
FACT THAT YOU GUYS JUST EMBRACED
IT AND WENT FOR IT, DIDN'T CARE,
DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER.
FIGGY, WHAT'S THE STATUS?
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK OUT THERE.
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE
RELATIONSHIP?
 YEAH, SO FIG TAILS IS PUT TO
REST.
IT'S NO MORE.
ULTIMATELY OUT IN THE JUNGLE, IN
THE WILD, I HAD SOMEONE TO
CONFIDE IN, AND IT WAS A
BEAUTIFUL THING OUT THERE,
SOMEONE TO TAKE AWAY MY
PARANOIA.
ULTIMATELY IT WAS MY DOWNFALL IN
THE GAME, AND I WISH, NO
OFFENSE, I COULD HAVE PLAYED AS
THE INDEPENDENT STRONG WOMAN I
AM TODAY FROM IT.
 Jeff: AND NO OFFENSE, IT
WAS YOUR CHOICE.
 IT WAS MY CHOICE, EXACTLY.
BLUE EYE, JEFF.
I'M SORRY.
 Jeff: AND TAYLOR, I THINK
THIS IS OKAY FOR ME TO SAY,
RIGHT, YOU ARE THE FATHER OF A
BABY, A NEW BABY.
 YEAH, NOW.
YEAH.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU GUYS WERE GREAT.
I THINK... I LOVE THE
MILLENNIALS.
I WAS SUPER IMPRESSED WITH THE
SPIRIT.
CHRIS, WE HAVE 30 SECONDS LEFT.
THIS IS A QUESTION I WANT TO
KNOW FROM YOU THE LAWYER, THE
THINKER, HOW MUCH OF THE TIME IN
THE GAME DO PLAYERS SPEND
THINKING ABOUT TWISTS THAT MIGHT
BE OUT THERE, LIKE WE HAD THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE, THE REWARD
SKILL, THINGS YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
BUT MIGHT COME?
 I THINK WE SPEND A LOT OF
TIME, JEFF, BUT I THINK THE WORD
IS "ADAPTABLE."
YOU HAVE TO ADAPT YOUR STRATEGY
TO THESE TWISTS.
I THINK WHAT A LOT OF THESE
GREAT PLAYERS UP HERE IN THE
FRONT ROW DID IS ADAPT THEIR
GAME WHEN THOSE TWISTS CAME.
YOU CAN'T... YOU THINK ABOUT
THEM ALL THE TIME.
YOU CAN'T PREDICT ALL OF THEM.
AND REALLY THE BEST EXAMPLE OF
ADAPTABILITY IS WHEN I WAS
BLINDSIDED, BRET LOST HIS TRUE
LOVE ON THE SHOW AND HE HAD TO
ADAPT VERY WELL.
 Jeff: UP NEXT, WE'RE GOING
TO TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING
NEXT SEASON, AND WE'RE GOING TO
SHOW YOU SOME OF THE PEOPLE,
FAMILIAR FACES RETURNING TO PLAY
AGAIN.
SURVIVOR: REUNION WILL CONTINUE
 Jeff: AH, FIJI, THE MOST
SPECTACULAR PLACE WE'VE EVER
SHOT "SURVIVOR."
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT FOR REAL.
AMAZING ISLAND, CRYSTAL CLEAR
WATER, WORLD CLASS SURF, SCOOB
DIVING, SUNSET, SAND.
WE LIKED FIJI SO MUCH, WE'RE
GOING BACK AGAIN.
HERE'S WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS DOING
NEXT YEAR.
WELL, YOU JUST MADE ONE OF THE
BIGGEST MOVES IN THE HISTORY OF
THIS GAME.
"SURVIVOR" IS THE MOST MENTALLY
CHALLENGING, FUZZICALLY
DEMANDING -- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE AN EVACUATION --
AND STRATEGICALLY COMPLEX
ADVENTURE GAME ON TELEVISION.
 I'M JUST PLAYING OUT NUMBERS
IN MY HEAD.
YOU PROBABLY SEE ME GOING LIKE
THIS QUITE A BIT.
 Jeff: THE PLAYERS HAVE
EVOLVED THE GAME BY PUSHING THE
BOUNDARIES WITH RISKY,
GAME-CHANGING MOVES.
 IF YOU WERE TO GIVE UP
IMMUNITY, THEN I WOULD BELIEVE
YOU.
 I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.
 SORRY.
 Jeff: INNOVATIVE METHODS
FOR GATHERING INFORMATION.
 I CAN HIDE RIGHT IN THERE AND
I'M WITHIN FIVE FEET AWAY
SITTING IN MY SPY SHACK.
 Jeff: AND ALL IN
MILLION-DOLLAR MOVES AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 THIS IS THE OTHER IMMUNITY
IDOL I'VE BEEN HANGING ON TO.
I'M GIVING IT TO EDDIE.
 THE LOOKS ON FACES.
 Jeff: THE GAME PLAY HAS
BECOME SO UNPREDICTABLE THAT
GETTING TO THE END NOW DEMANDS
THE WILLINGNESS TO RISK IT ALL.
 HERE'S THE THING...
 I'M DRAWING ROCKS UNLESS
SOMEONE IS VOTING MY WAY.
I'M DRAWING ROCKS.
 Jeff: AND REVEAL.
KATIE, GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD
OVER.
NEXT SEASON WE ARE BRINGING
TOGETHER THE MOST COMPETITIVE
GROUP OF PLAYERS EVER
ASSESSMENTABLED TO BATTLE IT OUT
ON THE ISLANDS OF FIJI.
 IT'S GOING TO TAKE BIG MOVES
