         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": AT THE MILLENNIAL
TRIBE, FIGGY FLIRTED WITH THE
MEN.
 THE TRIFORCE.
 Jeff: AND PUT TOGETHER AN
ALLIANCE OF FOUR, PUT TRIBEs
WAS CATCHING ON.
 FIGGY'S RUNNING THE SHOW.
 WE NEED TO TEAR APART THAT
POPULAR GROUP.
 Jeff: AT THE GEN-X TRIBE,
DAVID WAS SCARED OF EVERYTHING.
 THERE ARE GIRLS WITH MORE
TESTOSTERONE BACK AT THAT CAMP
THAN HE'S GOT.
 Jeff: WHILE MAJORITY
ALLIANCE CAME TOGETHER.








 IT'S EITHER RACHEL OR DAVID.
 I HAVE SIX PEOPLE.
I THINK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DAVID PLED HIS CASE.
 I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: IN THE END, HE WAS
SPARED, AND RACHEL WAS SENT
HOME.
RACHEL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
19 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

 IT SPARKS BUT IT DOESN'T
LIGHT.
 IT'S EMBARRASSING.
 HERE WE ARE ON DAY FIVE, AND
WE STILL DON'T HAVE FIRE.








OTHER THAN THAT, EVERYTHING IS
GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED.
I HAVE A SIX-PERSON ALLIANCE.
AND I'M GOING TO SAY IT LIKE IT
IS-- FOR CECE AND DAVID, THEY
TONIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.
CECE ALIGNED HERSELF WITH RACHEL
WHICH WAS A KISS OF DEATH.
 WHEN YOU GET TIRED I'LL TAKE
A WHACK AT IT.
 GO FOR IT.
 FOR DAVID, HE CAN'T HANDLE IT
OUT HERE.
 ALL RIGHT, DAVID!
 NO PRESSURE.
 YEAH.
RIGHT NOW, I THINK I'M PLAYING A
MISERABLE CAN "SURVIVOR" GAME,
SO I WANT TO BE A HERO FOR MY
TRIBE AND BRING THEM FIRE
BECAUSE I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THEM
SPARING ME LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL.
I'M NOT GIVING UP.
I REALLY NEED TO PROVE MYSELF
TODAY AND IT'S IN THE LINE WITH
THE THE GEN-X ATTITUDE, NEVER
GIVE UP.
I'M MORE OF A COCHRAN HANNAN
OZZY.
WHY DOES THIS FIRE HATE US SO
MUCH?
 COME ON, DAVE.
 KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
 I THINK I GOT SOMETHING,
GUYS.
 BLOW, BABY!
 YOU ARE REBORN, MY FRIEND.
DON'T SMOTHER IT.
DON'T SMOTHER IT.
 NICE, NICE!
 THAT IS AWESOME, DUDE.
WELL, GOOD WORK, DAVE, YOU DID
IT, MAN.
 ODDLY ENOUGH, DAVE, OUT OF
ALL OF US GOT A FLAME GOING.
 WHERE THE THE HELL HAS THIS
KID BEEN?
 GOOD JOB, DAVE.
 CAN YOU BREAK THAT IN HALF
FOR ME.
 HE'S STILL GOING HOME NEXT.
DAVE IS PROBABLY WEAKEST
CHALLENGE PERSON WE HAVE.
 I'LL HAVE TO CUT IT.
 HE'S LIKE OUR PUPPY DOG RIGHT
NOW.
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PETTING HIM
UNTIL WE GET RID OF HIM.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK, IF I
COLLECT BIG ROCKS THAT WE CAN,
LIKE, SIT ON AROUND THIS?
 OR JUST KEEPING HIM BUSY.
IF YOU LET HIM GET IN HIS OWN
HEAD, THAT'S WHEN HE GOES NUTS
AND STARTS LOOKING FOR IDOL
IDOLS AND GETTING ALL PARANOID.
 OF COURSE, NOT.
OF COURSE NOT.
I WOULD LOVE AN IDOL, BUT
CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRIBE FIRST,
AND WHILE DOING THAT, JUST KIND
OF BE LOOKING AROUND, BECAUSE
LOOKING FOR ROCKS AND LOOKING
FOR THE IDOL, THEY BOTH MAKE YOU
DIRTY.
SO THIS IS-- THIS IS AN AN
ALIBI.
CHAIR ONE.
 THAT ISA BOY.
 I GUESS NOT.
 WHOA!
ANTS AND SPIDERS.
 ANOTHER BIG ROCK.
 ONE MORE.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S IN HERE, ISN'T IT?
OH, MY GOD.
I JUST GOT TO SPLIT THIS POPE
HOLY-- HOLY CRAP.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!
GET OUT OF THERE!
YES!
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS WHY WE COME TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR."
"CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOUND THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
IF YOU USE THE IDOL AND...
"YEAH, SAME OLD RULES.
AND NOW I HAVE THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
I NEVER, EVER THOUGHT THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN FOR ME,
ESPECIALLY, ON THE NADE YEAR I'M
ON AND NOW I'M AT A ZENITH.
THIS IS SO PERFECT.
THIS IS CAN EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO MAKE
BIG, STRATEGIC MOVES RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS, LIKE, SERENDIPTY.
 I'LL PROBABLY NEVER LEAVE THE
WEST COAST.
 I FEEL LIKE IF I MOVE, I'LL
NEVER GO BACK EAST.
 LET'S MOVE TO L.A.
 OKAY, DONE.
 I REALLY LIKE FIGS.
SHE'S SUPER RAD, EASY TO BE
AROUND.
I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
AND IT'S JUST LIKE LOVE GOGGLES.
AND FIG IS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF
ME.
 IT'S LIKE TAKING SHOTS
BEFORE-- A GAME OF HOCKEY OR
SOMETHING.
 I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR
ROMANCE, BUT OH, MY GOD.
THOSE BLUE EYES, THEY ARE
DANGEROUS.
 GETTING PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.
 WAAA!
THEY ARE JUST GORGEOUS.
THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
AND I GET TO CUDDLE UP WITH
THAT.
I'M JUST LIKE, THAT'S FINE.
 THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I
HEAR A KISS SOUND, AND I WAS
LIKE Y'ALL CAN'T BE FOR REAL.
YOU STINK.
YOUR MOUTH IS NAFLTY.
YOU GOT SAND IN YOUR DRAWERS,
AND YOU KISSING SOMEBODY.
THAT'S DISGUSTING!
 I HEARD Y'ALL KISSING.
 YOU KISSED HER LAST NIGHT.
 SMILE IF YOU KISSED HER.
 MY DUDE KISSED HER ALREADY.
WHAAA!
 ME AND FIGS GOT CALLED OUT,
AND I LOOK AT THAT AS A RISKY
MOVE.
BUT MILLENNIALS ARE DREAMERS,
AND I'M DREAMING BIG.
 SHE SAID THAT?
 YEAH.
I WAS JUST LIKE--
 YOU GUYS ARE SO PRETTY!
 MY TRIBE DOESN'T EVEN
CONSIDER TAYLOR AND MYSELF BEING
A POWER COUPLE THREAT.
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE
MILLENNIALS.
ONLY PEOPLE-- COUGH, COUGH,
MICHAELA-- ARE GOING TO THROW IT
OUT THERE TO TRY TO PUT A TARGET
ON OUR BACKS.
BUT NOBODY CARES.
 THEY KEEP ISOLATING
THEMSELVES.
DO YOU SEE THEM SNUGGLING UP.
 I THINK THE MILLENNIAL
GENERATION TAKES HOOK-UPS A LOT
LESS SERIOUSLY THAN MAYBE THE
GEN-XERS DO.
AND I THINK IT'S THAT CASUAL
ATTITUDE THAT MIGHT BE GETTING
TAYLOR AND FIGGER IN TROUBLE.
YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE
ATTITUDE THAT YOU'RE PLAYING
"SURVIVOR" AND I THINK THEY MISS
THAT PART.
 THEY'RE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
 THEY'RE WAY TOO CLOSE.
 IT'S NOT GOOD.
 LOVE IN PARADISE.
 FIGGY AND TAYLOR ARE FREAKING
STUPID, MAN.
NO COUPLE EVER LASTS ON
"SURVIVOR."
EVER.
ME AND MICHELE ARE STILL IN AN
ALLIANCE WITH THEM, AND THIS
POWERFUL COUPLE CAN DESTROY
EVERYTHING WE CREATED.
TAYLOR IS MY BOY.
I LOVE THAT KID.
BUT SOMETIMES WOMEN BLIND YOU,
AND THEN YOU END UP STUCK WITH A
WOMAN AND YOU'RE BAILING ON YOUR
BOYS WHEN IT'S BOWLING NIGHT AND
YOU'RE STUCK AT HOME WITH YOUR
GIRLFRIEND.
YOU'RE A DORK.
LIKE WAKE UP.
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THIS
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BOY.
POWER COUPLES DON'T LAST.
IMAGINE SOMETHING GOES DOWN.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
 WE'LL GET PICKED OFF.
 YEAH, AND I'M NOT LOSING $1
MILLION.
I NEED THAT AND I KNOW YOU NEED
THAT.
 YEAH.
 YOU WANT TO SNOWBOARD AND
CHILL.
 I THOUGHT IT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH.
THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO PLAY
THIS GAME.
 TAYLOR IS SO OBLIVIOUS TO THE
FACT THAT, DUDE, IT'S NOT GOING
TO WORK BECAUSE HE'S SO
INFATUATED WITH FIGGY.
BUT THIS POWER COUPLE IS LIKE A
BULL'S EYE FOR A NUCLEAR
MISSILE.
THAT'S HOW BIG IT IS.
THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BLOW UP
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOOD.

I REALLY DON'T.
 REALLY?
THIS GIRL IS TRYING TO BE MY
FRIEND NOW.
FIGGY WAS GOING HOME, AND I WAS
PERFECTLY FINE WITH THAT.
BUT IF JAY'S TELLING THE TRUTH,
I COULD DEFINITELY BE IN
TROUBLE.
SO THIS WHOLE THING IS UP IN THE
AIR.
 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE
TO KEEP SIX STRONG.
 SO WHO ARE THESE SIX.
 ONE, TWO, THREE, MICHELLE,
WILL, AND TAILS.
 WE NEED WILL.
 WE BOTH KNOW WHAT FIGGY'S UP
TO, LIKE, AND WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE
OF.
 FIGGY IS THE KIND OF PERSON
IF YOU GIVE HER A LITTLE BIT OF
MOMENTUM, SHE WILL GO ALL THE
WAY TO END.
I'VE SEEN PARVITY DO IT, I'VE
SEEN JOHN COCHRAN DO IT.
WHO DO YOU WANT GONE?
 MARI!
 SHE'S A STRATEGIC PLAYER AND
SHE'S REALLY STRONG.
 THIS IS NERVE-RACKING,
CHANGING THE PLAN, LIKE, HOURS
BEFORE.
 I KNOW, BUT FIGGY, IF WE NEED
TO, IS AN EASY VOTE LATER.
 I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, YOU
HAVE A LOOF VERY GOOD POINT, BUT
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.
 THIS FOR TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
GOING TO DRAW A LINE.
FIGGY CAN'T GO TONIGHT.
IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.
IT'S SCARY TO ME BECAUSE I'M NOT
SURE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO
REALLY, TRULY SAVE FIGGY.
SO I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TO PULL
STRINGS AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TO
MAKE SURE I HAVE THE THE NUMBERS
AND GET WHAT I WANT.
MAKE SURE I HAVE THE THE NUMBERS
AND GET WHAT I WANT.
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH, DIP
IT IN, AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SO, ADAM, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.
( LAUGHTER )
WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.
 FIRST OF ALL, THIS PLACE IS
UNBELIEVABLE.
 IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M INSIDE MY
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW.
I'M IN FRONT OF JEFF PROBST, AND
IT'S A TERRIBLE NIGHT, RIGHT.
LIKE, THIS SUCKS.
 Jeff: MARI, ONE OF THE RAPS
ON THE MILLENNIALS IS THAT
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY, YOU DON'T
CALL ANYMORE.
YOU BREAK UP OVER TEXTS.
DOES THAT MAKE A MILLENNIAL
BETTER AT SOCIAL DYNAMICS?
 MY WORLD IS A TWO-DIMENSIONAL
WORLD.
I WOULD PLAY A GAME IN MY
MONITOR LIKE THIS, WHERE, EASY.
BUT TO DO IT WITH REAL-LIFE
PEOPLE.
IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
THING.
I THINK IT'S EMPATHY AND
EMOTION.
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE'S EYEBALLS
AND YOU SEE THEIR SOUL THROUGH
THEM, YOU GET TO KNOW THESE
PEOPLE AND START TO CARE ABOUT
THEM.
 Jeff: ZEKE, DOES IT
SURPRISE YOU THAT YOU'RE OUT
HERE, AND YOU'VE MADE A SHELTER.
YOU HAVE FIRE.
 OH, MY GOD!
I'M, LIKE, LIVING IN A DREAM
WORLD.
LIKE, I STARTED FIRE WITHOUT
FLINT.
LIKE, SKEWS ME?
THIS IS THE ADVENTURE OF A
LIFETIME.
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M MY BEST
VERSION OF MYSELF OUT HERE
BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE ALL OF
MYSELF OUT HERE.
BECAUSE, LIKE, EVERYTHING ABOUT
THIS EXPERIENCE IS INCREDIBLE.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, VERY
INTERESTING WHAT ZEKE JUST SAID,
THAT BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE,
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR
BEST SELF.
DO YOU FEEL THAT?
 NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
I FEEL LIKE THE SITUATIONS
YOU'RE IN HERE CAN BRING OUT THE
WORST THINGS.
 Jeff: WOW, SO EVERYTHING'S
NOT ROSY.
 NOOO..., NOT FOR ME THE AT
LEAST.
 Jeff: ADAM, ARE YOU
SURPRISED THAT MICHAELA IS SO
FORTHCOMING?
 I MEAN, I GET MICHAELA,
RIGHT.
SHE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
THAT'S A GREAT QUALITY TO HAVE
AS A PERSON, BUT THAT'S A TOUGH
TRAIT TO HAVE ON DAY ONE IN THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."
 BUT IT IS MY NATURAL REACTION
TO OBSERVE, AND I SAW A THE LOT
OF THINGS.
I SAW LITTLE GROUPS FOR ME.
LITTLE WHISPERS IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT.
PEOPLE ACT LIKE JUST BECAUSE I
WASN'T IN THE CIRCLE, I COULDN'T
INFLUENCE ANY CIRCLES.
 Jeff: WOW.
GAME IS CLEARLY ON AT CAMP
MILLENNIAL.
SO, HANNAH, WE TALKED ABOUT WHO
FEELS LIKE THEY'RE ON THE
OUTSIDE.
WHO DID YOU NOTICE INSTANTLY
BONDING?
 YEAH, WE ALL CUDDLE FOR
WARMTH IN THE SHELTER.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE CUDDLING A
LITTLE MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE.
I DON'T BLAME THEM.
THEY'RE BOTH VERY PRET GLE WHO
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT, HANNAH?
 I'M TALKING ABOUT TAYLOR AND
FIGGY.
 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE'S
TALKING ABOUT.
 IF THE SHELTER'S A-ROCKIN'
DON'T COME A-KNOCKEN.
 Jeff: SO, TAYLOR, THIS IS
OUT IN THE SEASON.
 WE GOT CALLED OUT MACKIN 'IN
THE SHACK.
 Jeff: SO YOU GUYS ARE
FULL-ON MAKING OUT.
 NO.
 I SECOND WHATEVER SHE SAID,
JEFF.
 Jeff: YOU'RE LEARNING!
BUT, WILL, IT IS COMPLICATED.
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT THESE
TWO WILL BE VOTING TOGETHER.
AND THAT'S TWO VOTES.
 YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE CUDDLING IN
THE SHELTER AND MAYBE OR MAYBE
NOT MAKING OUT WITH EACH OTHER,
THERE IS DEFINITELY AN
ASSUMPTION THAT THE TWO OF THEM
ARE WORKING TOGETHER.
 Jeff: ZEKE, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE?
DOES THIS TRIBE MIND THAT
THEY'RE TOGETHER?
 IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOOD.
FIGGY'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE LOYAL TO TAYLOR
THAN SHE WOULD BE LOYAL TO ME,
RIGHT?
 NO, IT'S JUST FUNNY AT THIS
POINT BECAUSE WE ALL KIND OF KID
AROUND AT CAMP ABOUT IT.
 I THINK WE'RE EARLY ENOUGH TO
WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE A CONCERN
IN THIS TRIBE.
 SERIOUSLY, YEAH.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, THAT GOT A
REACTION FROM YOU.
 YEAH.
I'M NOT STUPID.
IT'S, LIKE, THEY'RE TELLING YOU,
"I THINK YOU'RE SO DUMB THEY CAN
LIE STRAIGHT TO YOUR FACE AND
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND OUT."
 Jeff: WOW.
SO, MICHAELA, THERE'S CLEARLY
ANIMOSITY.
 NOT TO THE TRIBE.
IT FLUTTERS WITH, LIKE, A
PARTICULAR PERSON.
 Jeff: WHO IS THE PARTICULAR
PERSON?
 THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE, MISS
CUDDLE-SHACK.
 WHAT?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
 SEE HOW SHE PLAYED DUMB?
 NO I WAS LISTENING TO A
CONVERSATION.
ARE WE DOING THIS AGAIN?
 YEAH.
 OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
 PEANUT GALLERY OVER THERE,
MAN.
 Jeff: WOW!
I'M FASCINATING WITH THIS.
JAY, THERE'S ANOTHER ENTIRE
CONVERSATION HAPPENING BETWEEN
MICHELLE AND HANNAH.
 THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE AT
ALL.
OKAY?
EVERYONE IS YOUNG, ENERGETIC,
AND PARANOID TO THE POINT WHERE
IT'S JUST, LIKE, TOO MUCH.
 Jeff: SO, HANNAH.
 YEAH!
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M DIZZY.
I FEEL LIKE THE MORE I'M OUT
HERE THE MORE I JUST-- I'M
SORRY.
YOU'RE JEFF PROBST AND WE'RE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IT'S ALL VERY CONFUSE GLG DID I
MISAN ENTIRE CONVERSATION?
 YEAH.
I'M JUST GIVING YOU AN ANSWER
YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR.
( LAUGHTER )
 Jeff: MICHELLE, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE VOTE.
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOVE AFFAIR
AND WE HAVE A WAR, AND THEN WE
HAVE 10 PEOPLE PLAYING A GAME
THEY LOVE.
 YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A
GOOD POINT, THAT WE'RE ALL
TRYING TO PLAY A GAME WHERE
WE'RE THINKING FORWARD.
I ALSO THINK FIGGY IS IN THE
MIDDLE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE TRIBE.
AND SO IF I I WERE FIGGY, I
MIGHT BE SCARED.
 Jeff: FIGGY, WHEN YOU HEAR
YOUR NAME COME UP OPENLY WITH
TAYLOR, AND OPENLY WITH
MICHAELA, ARE YOU FEELING A
LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN?
 A LITTLE BIT.
BUT MY MIND'S AT PEACE RIGHT
NOW.
AND I FEEL GOOD.
 Jeff: ZEKE, SECONDS AWAY
FROM VOTING, THESE THREE ARE
STILL TALKING.
 I'M CURIOUS WHAT'S GOING ON.
 I'M CURIOUS WHAT'S GOING ON.
 I THINK IT'S JUST HANNAH
BEING HANNAH.
SURE THEY'RE TALKING AND, YOU
KNOW, WE COULD BE PARANOID AND
SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON.
BUT HANNAH IS JUST PEACHY.
AND WHATEVER SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT
PUPPIES OR SOMETHING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
WILL, YOU'RE UP.
WILL, YOU'RE UP.
 DARLING, YOU'RE MUCH TOO
DANGEROUS TO STAY IN THIS GAME.
 I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HOPE
I CAN TRUST MICHAELA.
 I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HOPE
I CAN TRUST MICHAELA.
 OKAY.
THEY'RE GETTING ME TO THROW MY
VOTE, I HAVE TO PROVE MY TRUST
WITH THEM.
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT THE
MOMENT.
FIG, MARI, MICHAELA.
MARI, MARI.
AAAHH!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING
ON.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
 SHE STILL HASN'T VOTED.
 OKAY!
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTE.
 Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND WANT TO
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, FIGGY.
MARI.
FIGGY.
MARI.
TWO VOTES FIGGY, TWO VOTES MARI.
FIGGY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES FIGGY.
MARI.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
THREE VOTES FIGGY, THREE VOTES
MARI.
MARI.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES MARI, THREE
VOTES FIGGY.
MARI.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES MARI, THREE
VOTES FIGGY.
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"MILLENNIALS VS.
GEN-X," MARI.
THAT'S SIX.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 Jeff: MARI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 SALTY.
 WELL DONE.
 Jeff: WELL, IT'S VERY CLEAR
THAT THE ENTHUSIASM ON THIS
TRIBE IS OVERSHADOWED ONLY BY
THE LEVEL OF GAME PLAY.
GLOVES ARE OFF, AND IT IS ON.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

and FORD.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
"SURVIVOR":
 ZEKE AND ADAM FEEL BETRAYED.
 I AM UPSET RIGHT NOW.
 MY FIRST HASHTAG BLINDSIDE.
 Jeff: BUT A TWIST IN THE
GAME SHAKES THINGS UP.
 I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS
TWIST.
I WANT TO EXPERIENCE WHAT GEN-X
HAS TO OFFER.
 ONE, TWO, THREE!
 I GOT ?IEPPED FROM A MILE
AWAY.
AND I NEVER SAW IT COMING.
"SURVIVOR" IS THE TOUGHEST GAME
I'VE EVER PLAYED BECAUSE IT
PULLS ON THE HEART STRINGS, AND
PLAY WITH HUMAN EMOTION IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN
PLAYING ON A 2-D SCREEN.
AND IT HURTS, MAN, THAT'S ALL I
CAN CAN SAY.
IT HURTS.
