         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE IKA BULA,
SUNDAY AND BRET WERE IN THE
MINORITY.
 I'M DOWN 4-2.
 Jeff: AT THE TAKALI TRIBE,
FIGGY AND TAYLOR WERE TRYING TO
HIDE THEIR ROMANCE.
 AWESOME.
 Jeff: AND ADAM FOUND
HIMSELF IN THE POWER SPOT
BETWEEN GEN-XERS AND THE
MILLENNIAL LOVERS.
 I'M THE GUY THEY NEED TO WORK
WITH.
 Jeff: AT THE VANUA TRIBE,
GEN-X WAS IN CONTROL, BUT THERE
WERE CRACKS WITHIN.








 I'LL DO IT.
 Jeff: AND CHRIS USED HIS
RELATIONSHIP WITH ZEKE TO PULL
IN THE MILLENNIALS.
 I'M READY TO MAKE A MOVE.
 FINALLY, I CATCH A BREAK IN
THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE GEN-XERS GAVE UP THEIR
NUMBERS AND SAFETY.
 CeCe, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: 15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.
 THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
 COMING BACK AFTER TRIBAL
COUNCIL.








THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE RELIEF.
CHRIS AND I SAID GOOD-BYE THE
CeCe WITH THESE TWO
MILLENNIALS.
 GOOD JOB.
 IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT
THING TO DO GOING FORWARD.
IT'S NO LONGER MILLENNIALS
VERSUS GEN-X, IT'S THE PEOPLE I
TRUST VERSUS THE PEOPLE YOU
TRUST.
DAVID, IT WAS GREAT VOTING WITH
YOU TODAY.
 IT WAS A PLEASURE VOTING WITH
YOU AND MICHELLE.
YOU GUYS DID IT.
YOU GUYS FOLLOWED THROUGH.
 TRIBAL WAS SUCH A DELIGHT
BECAUSE THOSE SILLY GEN-XERS
SENT HOME ONE OF THEIR OWN ON
THE ONE TRIBE THEY HAD THE
NUMBERS.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEEM TO BE
IN A POWER POSITION WITH CHRIS,
AND I'M SO STOKED.
I'M A BRAND-NEW BABY IN THIS
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."
I'M A BRAND-NEW BABY IN THIS
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."
 I AM COMPLETELY HUNGRY.
 RIGHT.
EVERYONE IS HUNGRY.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING GRUMPY, BUT
I GOT TO STAY FOCUSED ON THIS
GAME BECAUSE I HAVE THIS PASSION
INSIDE OF MYSELF THAT SAYS, YOU
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY.
YOU WANT TO GO GET THAT COCONUT?
 LET'S DO IT.
 SO I GOT MY MOM AND MY
SISTER, AND I INNER HAD A DAD OR
NOTHING, SO IT'S LIKE I GOT TO
TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL
LADIES.
PEOPLE SAY MILLENNIALS ARE
SELFISH AND THEY WANT TO DO
THINGS THEIR OWN WAY AND THEY DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT, BUT IT'S NOT
TRUE.
THIS IS FOR MY FAMILY.
I'M GOING TO WIN "SURVIVOR."
 I DON'T KNOW.
 A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IS THE
ONLY CUSHION.
I NEED TO FIND THIS THING, AND
I'M SEARCHING EVERYWHERE TO FIND
THIS THING.
 THIS IS WEIRD.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
 THERE'S THIS LITTLE GREEN
SYMBOL, AND I'M LIKE, WHAT THE
HELL IS THAT?
AND I SEE THE STAMP, AND I KNOW
IT'S GOT TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE,
BUT I'M LIKE, NO, IT'S NOT HERE,
WHAT THE HELL?
I'M LOOKING AT THE TREE I'M
LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS, AND
BREAK THIS BAMBOO!
I KNEW IT.
AND THEN I HEAR THE "SURVIVOR"
SONG IN THE BACKGROUND.
I'M LIKE, THIS IS AWESOME.
 HOLY CRAP.
 I FOUND AN IDOL.
 DUDE, OH, MY GOD.
DUDE.
MY GOD, MAN.
 THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
MEANS, MOM, YOU JUST GOT ONE
STEP CLOSER TO GETTING A HOUSE.
TODAY IS PROBABLY THE BEST DAY
I'VE HAD ON "SURVIVOR."
I'M SET RIGHT NOW.
 DUDE, THIS STAYS BETWEEN ME
AND YOU.
 SECRETS, SECRETS.
 HEY, WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
 I WALK UP ON THEM TWO HUDDLED
UP LIKE TWO ESKIMOS, AND OUT
POPS THIS IDOL.
 WELL, NOW WE KNOW.
 JAY IS ONE OF MY ALLIES AT
THIS POINT, BUT DO I THINK JAY
WOULD PLAY THAT IMMUNITY IDOL ON
ME?
HECK NO.
 THAT WAS BAD TIMING.
 HORRIBLE.
 FRICKEN MICHAELA.
 RIGHT NOW I'M NOT GOING TO
TELL ANYBODY THAT JAY HAS THE
IDOL, BUT IF I GET WIND OF
SOMETHING GOING DOWN,
I'M SNITCHING.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
BOTH TRIBES GETTING YOUR NEW
LOOK AT THE NEW VANUA TRIBE.
CeCe VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WOW.
 Jeff: AND A LOT OF
REACTION.
FIGGY, YOU WERE FIRST ONE, YOU
WERE CLAPPING THE SECOND YOU SAW
IT WAS CeCe.
 I LOVE MICHELLE.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BUT I WAS
REALLY WORRIED.
SOUNDED REALLY BAD.
SORRY.
MICHELLE AND I ARE REALLY,
REALLY CLOSE.
I LOVE HER.
 Jeff: MICHELLE, DOES IT
CONCERN YOU THAT IN A GAME LIKE
THIS FIGGY IS SO OPEN?
 NO, I THINK TRUTH WORKS WELL
IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: YOU MAY BE THE FIRST
PERSON TO EVER SAY THAT PHRASE,
"THE TRUTH WORKS WELL IN THIS
GAME."
 I'LL OWN IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, ONE PERSON WILL BE
YOUR CALLER.
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL BE
BLINDFOLDED.
USING ONLY VERBAL COMMANDS, THE
CALLER WILL INSTRUCT THE
BLIND-FOLDED TRIBE MEMBERS TO
COLLECT THE PUZZLE PIECES.
THEN THE CALLER WILL DIRECT A
STILL-BLINDFOLDED TRIBE MEMBER
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: FIRST TWO TRIBES TO
FINISH WIN REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR IN.
 YES.
PLEASE.
 Jeff: FIRST TRIBE TO
FINISH...
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: APPLE PIE, COOKIE,
BROWNIES, ICED TEA, COLD MILK.
 APPLE PIE?
 Jeff: SECOND TRIBE TO
FINISH, NOT BAD, CHOCOLATE CHIP
CAPE COD I CANS.
ALL RIGHT.
CALLER, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO SIT
OUT?
 JESS.
 ME.
 Jeff: IKA BULA, YOU HAVE
TWO EXTRA TRIBE MEMBERS.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE IN.
 IT'S GOING TO BE BRET AND I.
 Jeff: BRET AND HANNAH WILL
SIT OUT.
SIT ON THE BENCH.
EVERYONE ELSE TAKE A MINUTE THE
STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL GET IT ON.
HERE WE GO.
FOR A NICE REWARD, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO!
 GO RIGHT.
 RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT,
RIGHT.
 WALK FORWARD, WALK FORWARD.
 LEFT A LITTLE BIT.
KEEP GOING.
 Jeff: ALL ABOUT
COMMUNICATION.

 Jeff: ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
CLEAR?
 STRAIGHT.
KEEP GOING.

 STOP.
 Jeff: KEN ON THE FIRST
OBSTACLE.
SUNDAY ON AN OBSTACLE.
 TURN RIGHT.
 GO TO YOUR LEFT.
KEEP GOING, ZEKE.
 WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE.
 Jeff: ADAM TRYING TO GET A
PAIR OF PUZZLE PIECES.
SUNDAY STILL WORKING, GETTING
DIZZY NOW.
SHE'S GOT IT FREE.
SHE FALLS DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
SUNDAY NOW DIS ORIENTED.
ADAM HAS A PAIR OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
 THAT'S IT, ZEKE.
 Jeff: ZEKE HAS A SET OF
PUZZLE PIECES.
THERE ARE FOUR SETS OF PUZZLE
PIECES FOR EACH TRIBE.
 MICHAELA, PULL THAT ROPE

 Jeff: CHRIS HAS THE SECOND

 RUN, RUN, RUN.
 Jeff: KEN AND TAYLOR AT

PIECES.
 FASTER, KEN, FASTER, KEN.
 Jeff: WHERE IS IT?
 IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
 Jeff: CHRIS WITH THE SECOND
SET OF PIECES FOR VANUA.
 SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO
DAVID REAL FAST.
 DAVID, WALK TO YOUR RIGHT.
 TELL HIM AGAIN.
 WALK TO YOUR RIGHT.
 Jeff: DAVID DOESN'T KNOW
WHICH DIRECTION TO GO.
IS HE HEADED RIGHT, LEFT, NORTH,
SOUTH?
 NO, NO, YOU'RE GOING TO THE
WRONG PUZZLE.
NO, DAVID, NO.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
 KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
 I'M AN OLD MAN.
I SHOULD NOT BE SPINNING.
 Jeff: KEN TAKES A BIG FALL.
 IS THERE A KEY?
IS THERE A KEY?
 RIGHT HERE.
 MICHAELA, TO THE RIGHT.
GET THE ROPE.
UNTIE THE ROPE.
 UNDO IT AND GET THE PUZZLE
PIECES.
OKAY, GOOD.

 Jeff: KEN AND TAYLOR COMING

PUZZLE PIECES.

THEY CAN START WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLE.
 SEPARATE THEM EVENLY.
 Jeff: IT IS NOW FIGGY AND
KEN TRYING TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE
WITH KEN BLINDFOLDED.
 RIGHT THERE, TURN LEFT.
PULL IT, PULL IT, PULL UP.
 Jeff: DAVID FINALLY HAS
SOMETHING TO DO.
DAVID UNSPOOLING.
MICHAELA HAS THE FOURTH AND
FINAL PAIR OF PUZZLE PIECES.
 USE YOUR RIGHT HAND.
 USE YOUR RIGHT HAND.
 Jeff: AND DAVID AND ZEKE
TRYING TO GET THE LAST TWO FOR
VANUA.
DAVID HAS A SET OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
HE CAN HEAD BACK.
 GO TO THE TABLE.
PUT IT DOWN.
 Jeff: MICHAELA HAS THE
FOURTH AND FINAL SET.
START SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
 THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.
 Jeff: HUGE TIME ADVANTAGE
FOR TAKALI.
THEY HAVE HAD A MASSIVE HEAD
START FOR A MASSIVE REWARD.
DAVID BACK WITH THAT THIRD SET
OF PIECES FOR VANUA.
 HURRY, ZEKE.
YOU GOT THIS.
THIS IS THE LAST PUZZLE PIECE.
 Jeff: ZEKE BACK WITH THAT
FOURTH AND FINAL SET.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE
UP.
ZEKE WILL BE THE PUZZLE SOLVER.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE
SOLVING THE PUZZLE ARE BLIND
FOLDED.
 SHE'S GOING TO FAINT.
 WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK HERE.
POP DOWN IN THE SHADE.
YOU LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED
MEDICAL.
 I'M GOOD.
 Jeff: DON'T HESITATE TO
SAY.
 NO, NO, NO.
 Jeff: MICHELLE STARTED AT A
MAJOR DISADVANTAGE.
IT WOULD BE AN IMPRESSIVE
COME-FROM-BEHIND.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
 Jeff: FIGGY AND KEN HAVE
HAD A HUGE LEAD.
CAN THEY USE IT TO THEIR
ADVANTAGE?
MICHAELA WITH JAY MAKING SOME
PROGRESS.
 RIGHT, THERE RIGHT THERE.
 Jeff: VANUA WAS IN DEAD
LAST IN THIS CHALLENGE.
MICHELLE AND ZEKE GIVING IT
THEIR BEST SHOT TO CATCH UP.
 PUT THE ONE IN YOUR HAND, PUT
THAT IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER.
 WHAT?
FIGGY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S NOT RIGHT.
 THE WHOLE FACE IS...
 JUST RELAX.
 Jeff: MICHELLE AND ZEKE
WORKING REALLY WELL TOGETHER.
COULD BE AN INCREDIBLE COMEBACK.
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.
ZEKE TRYING TO GET IT IN.
 YES, THAT'S IT!
 Jeff: AND THEY'RE RIGHT.
FROM BEHIND, VANUA WINS A
MASSIVE REWARD.
THEY'RE NOW LOOKING FOR SECOND
PLACE.
 I'M RIGHT HERE.
OKAY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT ONE.
 Jeff: NOW JAY AND MICHAELA,
FIGGY AND KEN LOOKING FOR
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.
ANOTHER PIECE FOR JAY.
KEN MOVING ANOTHER PIECE.
MICHAELA SLIDES ANOTHER PIECE.
 JEFF, I'M DONE.
 Jeff: JAY THINKS HE'S DONE.
JAY IS RIGHT.
IKA BULA WINS REWARD, CHOCOLATE
CHIP COOKIES SENDING TAKALI BACK
TO CAMP EMPTY HANDED AFTER A
GIGANTIC LEAD.
 ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ALL
RIGHT.
 YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?
 I CAN'T TELL IF I'M PANICKING
OR DEHYDRATED.
 MEDICAL, DR. JOE, CAN WE TAKE
A LOOK AT HANNAH.
 HANNAH.
 MY ARMS ARE CRAMPING UP.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH HANNAH?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET ME
DIE?
 OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
BREATHING A LITTLE BIT QUICK.
BREATHE WITH ME.
JUST SLOW IT DOWN.
NICE AND SLOW.
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER.
 AM I?
 YES.
YOU'RE FINE.
 Jeff: JOE, WHAT'S
HAPPENING?
 I THINK HANNAH GOT A BIT
EXCITED DURING THE CHALLENGE AND
SHE STARTED BREATHING A LITTLE
BIT TOO QUICK.
IF YOU DO IT WITHOUT A GOOD
REASON PHYSICALLY, THEN IT CAN
MAKE YOUR BLOOD GO ACIDIC.
ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS IS YOU GET
SPASMS IN THE WRISTS AND THE
HANDS.
HANNAH'S MANAGED TO CALM HERSELF
DOWN AND THE SYMPTOMS HAVE
STARTED TO RESOLVE ALREADY.
 Jeff: YOU SEEM TO KNOW
THIS, YOU SEEM TO BE AWARE OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
 I KNEW COMING OUT HERE THAT I
COULD PANIC OR SOMETHING, BUT I
DIDN'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE.
 Jeff: WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT WILL EXPOSE YOUR
VULNERABILITY, IT'S "SURVIVOR."
THE SIGN OF COURAGE IS THAT YOU
CAME OUT HERE DESPITE BEING
CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
I'LL GET YOU SOME WATER.
 THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL, HANNAH?
 I FEEL A LOT BETTER.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
 YOU LOOK BETTER.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO THE RESULTS A
MASSIVE COME-FROM-BEHIND VICTORY
LED BY MICHELLE.
HUGE REWARD.
COME GRAB IT.
APPLE PIE, COOKIES.
ICED TEA, MILK.
ENJOY IT.
IKA BULA, IT'S NOT A TABLE FULL.
MICHAELA.
 I'LL TAKE THAT.
 Jeff: COME GET IT.
ENJOY.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: SO FIGGY, IT'S A HERO
OR ZERO ROLE WHEN YOU SAY I WILL
BE THE CALLER.
WHAT HAPPENED?
 IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING WHEN
YOU'RE SO CLOSE AND YOU'RE THE
CALLER AND YOU'RE THE LEADER AND
YOU JUST... YOU'RE GOOD AT
PUZZLES, BUT IT'S HARD TO DIRECT
THE BLIND AND YOU HOPE YOU CAN
AND THEN YOU FAIL.
IT SUCKS.
IT'S JUST HARD.
 Jeff: TAKALI, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY.
 I'M SO CONTENT RIGHT NOW.
 WHAT'S FUNNY, BEFORE A DEAL
LIKE THIS, YOU'RE ALL LIKE IN MY
WAY FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
IT'S.
THERE AND NOW IT'S LIKE, OH, MY
GOD, WE GOT PIE.
 I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE
WON THAT CHALLENGE WITH
CeCe.
 I THINK IT WAS 100% MICHELLE
SOLVING THAT PUZZLE.
 AND FIGGY SEEMS TO REALLY
LIKE ME.
 THAT WAS A REAL SLIP ON HER
PART.
 MICHELLE IS A VERY DAVID DANG
PLAYER, BECAUSE AS FIGGY
ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD AT THE
CHALLENGE, I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE
MICHELLE, AND THEN, OH, AND
ZEKE, TOO.
IT'S LIKE, HI, MICHELLE.
IT WAS, I LOVE MICHELLE.
OH, WAIT, AND ZEKE.
HI, HI, GOOD THE SEE YOU.
OBVIOUSLY I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE MILLENNIALS.
SO MY GUT TELLS ME THAT GETTING
RID OF MICHELLE ISN'T BAD FOR
ME, RIGHT, BECAUSE MICHELLE HAS
CONNECTIONS TO TAYLOR AND FIGGY.
 FIGGY HONESTLY OWES ME HER
LIFE IN THIS GAME.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY,
THIS BUT I THINK TO GO FORWARD,
IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO
GIVE UP ON THE MILLENNIAL TRIBE.
IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO
GIVE UP ON THE MILLENNIAL TRIBE.
 THAT'S FASCINATING.
A PANIC ATTACK IS NOT A LOT OF
PANIC.
IT'S SUPPRESSED PANIC.
AND THIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU
CONSTANTLY ARE NOT ADDRESSING
EVERY EMOTION.
LIKE I ALREADY KNOW I'M GOING TO
BE MADE FUN OF BY SOME OF THE
PEOPLE.
I CAN'T HELP THAT I'M A PERSON
THAT HAS ANXIETY.
OF COURSE IT'S EMBARRASSING.
YOU'RE JUST COLLAPSING AND
YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THE
CHALLENGE.
THERE WERE GAME THOUGHTS OF, I
CAN'T SEEM WEAK.
THAT'S THE WORST PART, I CAN'T
SEEM THIS WEAK IN FRONT OF MY
TRIBE.
 I GET IT.
I THINK WE'VE PROVEN TO
OURSELVES THAT WE CAN DO THIS.
MY BRAIN IS SO EXHAUSTED.
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT WHEN YOU
CAN BREATHE OUT AND BE LIKE,
OKAY, I'M GOING THE TAKE FIVE
MINUTES FOR "SURVIVOR" AND TAKE
A BREATH.
SO I HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
PERCEPTION IS REALITY.
I HAVE TO KEEP SAYING I'M GOOD
SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT I'M
GOOD, SO THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME
A HINDRANCE TO MY GAME.
 I'M SO STOKED FOR MY COCONUT.
I'M SO STOKED FOR MY COCONUT.
 WHAT IF WE JUST STARTED
MAKING OUT IF N FRONT OF YOU,
ADAM?
 GROSS.
 MY "SURVIVOR" ROMANCE IS
GROWING EACH DAY, BUT FIGS IS
LIKE, DON'T TELL JESS AND KEN
ABOUT OURSHOWMANCE.
WE'RE A POWER COUPLE, AND AT
THIS POINT THERE'S NO REASON TO
HIDE IT.
EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS.
 ADAM IS ON OUR SIDE.
 I KNOW.
 CAN I JUST TELL.
 TAYLOR AND I ARE LIKE A
THING.
 RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE NUMBERS
WITH ADAM, BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT
COMING OUT.
 WILL THAT BE WEIRD IN.
 YES, IT WILL BE WEIRD.
GO DO IT.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF
REACTION IT'S GOING TO BE.
 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING.
 OKAY.
 THAT'S WHAT FREAKS ME OUT THE
MOST.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE
A GOOD REACTION OR A BAD
REACTION.
 I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THIS OR
KEN THIS BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF
NERVOUS, BUT I KIND OF HAVE A
THING WITH TAYLOR.
 WOW.
YOU THINK?
 YOU REALLY KNEW?
 YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD WITH
KEEPING SECRETS.
 KEN, I WAS JUST TELLING
JESSICA TAYLOR AND I HAVE A
THING.
 YOU'RE KIDDING.
REALLY?
I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED.
DOES THAT MEAN WHEN I WAKE UP IN
THE MORNING AND I SEE YOU
CUDDLING AND HOLDING HANDS AND
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER?
I'VE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK,
LITTLE GIRL.
I'VE BEEN AROUND WAY LONGER THAN
YOU.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
AND SHE WAS SHOCKED.
SHE THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN DOING
A GREAT JOB OF HIDING IT.
 I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE A
SECRET-TYPE THING.
 I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING
SOMETHING,.
THESE KIDS THINK THEY'RE IN
CHARGE OF IT ALL.
THEY THINK, THIS IS VACATION,
THIS IS FUN, I'M ON "SURVIVOR,"
THIS IS AWESOME.
BUT THAT LITTLE COUPLE OF TAYLOR
AND FIGGY AREN'T AS COOL AS THEY
THINK THEY ARE.
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT ON MY ASS
AN HOPE AND PRAY EVERYTHING IS
OKAY.
I'M GOING TO MAKE MOVES TO MAKE
SURE I'M OKAY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
GOT THE TAKE BACK THE IDOL.
 HEY, JUNIOR.
 TRAINING FOR THE BIG ONE
TODAY.
 Jeff: THANK YOU, WILL.
ONCE AGAIN IMMONEYTY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'LL
RACE ACROSS A SERIES OF BALANCE
BEAM, COLLECT BAGS OF COCONUTS,
BRING THEM UP THE BEACH.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL SIX BAGS,
YOU'LL OPEN THEM TO FIND THREE
BALLS.
TWO PLAYERS WILL THEN MANEUVER
THOSE BALLS THROUGH A TABLE
MAZE.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO GET ALL
THREE BALLS TO THE END WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WILL

PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

IKA BULA, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA

THE BENCH.
EVERYONE ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.

DAVID HAS HIS FIRST BAG.
KEN UNTYING.
 GOOD JOB, JAY.
LET'S GO.
 Jeff: JAY HAS HIS THIRD AND
A BIG FALL.
DAVID WITH HIS THIRD.
 NICE JOB, DAVID.
 Jeff: DAVID'S A BIG
SURPRISE IN THIS CHALLENGE.
IT IS KEN WHO IS STRUGGLING.
JAY BRINGING UP ALL THREE BAGS
AT ONCE.
DAVID CAN ONLY BRING ONE.
BUT HE'S STILL GOT A LEAD OVER
KEN.
KEN NOW WITH A THIRD BAG.
 GOSH, THAT'S A HARD FALL.
 Jeff: JAY BACK WITH HIS
THIRD BAG.
GO, IKA BULA.
KEN NOW BRINGING UP THREE BAGS
AT ONCE, AND NOW HE'S MAKING UP
TIME.

THE LAST THREE BAGS.
BRET RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
TAYLOR QUICKLY GETS HIS FIRST,
SECOND AND THIRD BAG ALL AT

BRET WITH HIS THIRD BAG.
 YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.
 Jeff: ONCE TAYLOR'S BACK,
YOU'RE GOOD.
PICK 'EM UP NOW.
TAKALI HAS A HUGE LEAD.
HERE COMES BRET WITH HIS FINAL
THREE BAGS.
CHRIS NOW WITH HIS THIRD.
CHRIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE
FAST TO STAY IN THIS.
KEN AND TAYLOR WORKING TOGETHER
QUICKLY.
THEY HAVE THAT SIXTH AND FINAL
BAG.
YOU'RE DONE.
GO, LADIES.
IT IS NOW FIGGY AND JESSICA.
YOU HAVE TO EMPTY ALL THE
COCONUTS.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE BALLS.
JAY WITH HIS SIXTH BAG.

HERE COMES CHRIS WITH HIS THIRD
BAG.
MICHAELA AND HANNAH DOING A NICE
JOB.
GO, VANUA!
MICHELLE NOW UNTYING COCONUTS.
TAKALI, THEY'VE GOT THEM ALL.
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE
BALLS.
JESSICA AND FIGGY HAVE THEIR
THREE BALLS.
STILL WORKING ON THAT MAZE.
YOU HAVE TO WORK A VERY
DIFFICULT TABLE MAZE WHILE
HAVING BOTH YOUR FEET ON A VERY
SMALL PEG.
JESSICA AND FIGGY WITH A HUGE
TIME ADVANTAGE.
MICHAELA AND HANNAH HAVE THE
LAST SET.
THEY HAVE THEIR THREE BALLS.
HEAD UP.
ZEKE ON THAT LAST BAG, TRYING TO
MAKE UP TIME.
THERE IT IS.
FIND THE BALLS AND GET UP HERE.
IT IS FIGGY AND JESSICA.
 WE GOT TO GO THAT WAY.
 Jeff: MICHAELA AND HANNAH.
 WAIT.
STOP MOVING SO BIG.
 Jeff: AND ZEKE AND MICHELLE
FOR IMMUNITY.
MICHELLE AND ZEKE KNOW THEY'VE
GOT TO MAKE UP SOME TIME.
GOING WILD OUT OF THE GATE.
 SORRY.
 YOU'RE TOO STIFF ON THE
BOARD.
JUST HOLD IT.
 MICHAELA CONTINUES TO BARK
ORDERS AT HANNAH, MAKING SURE
HANNAH KNOWS WHAT TIME IT IS.
 Jeff: ALL THREE PAIRS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EACH
OTHER'S RHYTHM.
MICHAELA AND HANNAH IN A TOUGH
SPOT.
YOU HAVE TO GET AROUND A VERY
NARROW CHANNEL.
MICHAELA AND HANNAH AS CLOSE AS
THEY'VE BEEN.
 I DON'T NEED YOU TO MOVE AT
ALL.
 I'M JUST HOLDING ON.
HANNAH AND MICHAELA HAVE THE
LEAD NOW.
JESSICA AND FIGGY CLOSE.
RACING WILL GET YOU NOWHERE BUT
A DATE WITH ME AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 DON'T GET FRUSTRATED.
 I'M NOT FRUSTRATED.
I'M GETTING YELLED AT.
 I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO WIN.
I'M TRYING TO KEEP US ALL HERE.
GO DOWN SLIGHTLY, SLIGHTLY.
THERE YOU GO!
 Jeff: HANNAH AND MICHAELA
HAVE A HUGE LEAD.
FIGY AND JESSICA VERY CLOSE.
FIGGY AND JESSICA DROP THEIR
FIRST BALL.
THEY HAVE ONE.
MICHELLE AND ZEKE, THEY'RE
GETTING NOWHERE.
 LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED TO
RESET.
 Jeff: HANNAH AND MICHAELA
MAY NOT EVER WANT TO ROAD TRIP
TOGETHER.
 I LOVE HANNAH.
I JUST NEED PEOPLE TO SHUT UP.
I NEED YOU STEADY.
I NEED YOU STEADY.
 Jeff: THEY'RE WITHIN INCHES
OF SECURING IMMUNITY.
 LIFT UP SLIGHTLY.
 Jeff: AND THEY HAVE IT.
HANNAH AND MICHAELA WIN
IMMUNITY!
IKA BULA IS SAFE.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SECOND PLACE.
IT IS JESSICA AND FIGGY VERSUS
MICHELLE AND ZEKE.
THEY KNOW THEY'VE GOT TO GET
SOMETHING GOING.
NO.
 ZEKE, MICHELLE, ONLY ONE
PERSON MOVE IT WHEN YOU ALL GET
PAST THAT BAR.
 Jeff: MICHAELA NOW HELPING
MICHELLE AND ZEKE.
STOP THE BALL.
STOP.
MAKE IT STOP.
NICE SAVE.
CAN THEY GET IT TO DROP?
LITERALLY ONE INCH AWAY.
THERE IT IS.
WE ARE TIED 1-1.
NOW WE GOT A CHALLENGE.
JESSICA AND FIGGY, NICE SAVE.
AND THEY DROP THEIR SECOND.
JESSICA AND FIGGY NOW ONE BALL
LEFT TO SECURE IMMUNITY.
PRESSURE NOW ON MICHELLE AND
ZEKE.
NICE TOUCH.
WILL IT DROP?
 IT'S GOING TO DROP.
 Jeff: WE ARE TIED AGAIN.
2-2.
IT IS A RACE TO THE FINISH.
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.
IF VANUA CAN PULL THIS OUT, IT
WOULD BE A GIGANTIC COMEBACK.
NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO TRIBAL.
HERE COMES JESSICA AND FIGGY.
ALL AROUND IT.
MICHELLE AND ZEKE WITH A NICE
SAVE.
JESSICA AND FIGGY, CAN THEY SAVE
IT?
NO.
MICHELLE AND ZEKE, THEY DROP IT
FOR IMMUNITY.
VANUA SAFE.
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
IKA BULA, CONGRATULATIONS.
IMMUNITY.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.
VANUA, CONGRATULATIONS.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.
SO I GOT TO ASK, THERE WAS
CLEARLY SOME ENCOURAGEMENT
COMING FROM YOU, MICHAELA,
TOWARD VANUA.
WHAT'S THAT STORY?
 WELL, WE WANT MILLENNIALS TO
STAY.
WHEN YOU GET 2-2, SOMEBODY HAS
TO GO HOME.
 THERE'S MILLENNIALS OVER
HERE, BUT THERE'S THREE OF YOU,
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
WORK TOGETHER, YOU DESERVE TO GO
HOME.
 Jeff: IKA BULA, NOBODY
GOING HOME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
TAKALI, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 TAKALI TRIBE IS GOING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
IT REALLY BLOWS, BUT IF THE
MILLENNIALS ARE SMART, WE'LL
STICK TOGETHER AND TAKE OUT THE
GEN-XERS.
 WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
 WE TRIED.
 WE WERE SO CLOSE.
 I KNOW.
 LOSING PUTS ME IN A REAL
BIND, BECAUSE THIS WHOLE TIME
THAT I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, I'VE
BEEN PLAYING DOUBLE AGENT, AND
IT CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE IF I
WANTED TO SIDE WITH JESSICA AND
KEN THAT I COULD DO THAT.
IF I WANTED TO SIGN WITH FIGGY
AND TAYLOR, I COULD DO THAT, BUT
NO MATTER HOW I VOTE TONIGHT,
SOMEBODY IS COMING BACK UNHAPPY,
AND I'M IN A REALLY, RALLY TOUGH
POSITION.
 I'M ON BOARD WITH YOU.
 I KNOW.
I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE.
 IT'S GOT TO BE KEN OR
JESSICA.
 I KNOW.
OF COURSE.
 WHO WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE
OUT?
 KEN.
WE DO KEN...
 I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS HARD.
THIS IS SO HARD.
 I THINK WE GOT TO GO KEN.
 I THINK SO TOO.
 THE PLAN IS TO TAKE OUT KEN.
HE'S A DANGEROUS PLAYER IN THIS
GAME, AND COME MERGE HE'S GOING
TO BE A THREAT IN CHALLENGES.
 I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME
PAGE.
 I'M VOTING KEN.
 YES.
 OKAY.
 TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT KEN.
 OH, DAMMIT.
WHY DID WE LOSE?
I HATE THIS.
 BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE ADAM IS
DOUBLE CROSSING US AND HE'S WAY
SMARTER THAN WE THINK HE IS.
UNLIKELY, BUT MAYBE.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 CAN WE REALLY TRUST ADAM
RIGHT NOW?
 I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY BUT
YOU.
 THIS SUCKS.
 WHAT SUCKS?
 WELL, IF YOU WANT TO WORK
WITH ME, LET'S GET OUT KEN.
HE'S SOLID, 100%.
WE'LL VOTE OUT THOSE TWO.
AND THEN IT'S YOU, ME AND KEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHERE'S YOUR HEART AT RIGHT NOW?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I MEAN, ARE THEY TALKING KEN?
 OF COURSE.
 OKAY.
 FIGGY AND TAYLOR ARE GOING TO
VOTE FOR KEN, BUT CLEARLY THIS
CAN'T HAPPEN, BECAUSE I NEED KEN
TO MOVE FORWARD.
HE'S GOT MY BACK, AND I HAVE
HIS.
AND IF KEN WENT HOME, I WOULD BE
THE NEXT ONE TO GO.
 SO YOU NEED TO GO TALK TO
ADAM AND CONVINCE ADAM THAT
YOU'RE WITH HIM 150%, OTHERWISE
HE'S GOING TO PUT YOUR NAME
DOWN.
YOU NEED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT
YOU WILL NEVER WRITE HIS NAME
DOWN.
THE THREE OF US WILL RUN THIS
GAME.
 I COULD BE GOING HOME, BUT
I'VE NEVER GONE DOWN WITHOUT A
FIGHT.
SO UNTIL TRIBAL TONIGHT, I'M
GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR THIS.
 I RESPECT YOU.
JESS RESPECTS YOU.
WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH TWO CONNIVING, ARROGANT
KIDS, SO YOU WANT TO SIT OVER
THERE WITH ME AND DAVID AND
JESS, OR DO YOU WANT TO SIT OVER
THERE WITH TAYLOR, FIG, THE COOL
KIDS KNOWING YOU ARE AT THE VERY
BOTTOM.
 BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
ME TO DO IS TRUST IN PEOPLE THAT
I'VE NEVER MET BEFORE.
 I HAVE YOUR BACK UNTIL THE
END.
I HAVE YOU BACK AND I WILL NEVER
PUT YOU NAME DOWN, ANDLY FIGHT
FOR YOU.
IT'S MATTER OF WHO YOU WANT TO
MOVE FORWARD WITH, MAN.
 MY MIND IS JUST REELING RIGHT
NOW, BECAUSE KEN MAKES REALLY
GOOD ARGUMENTS.
THE QUESTION IS: WHICH SIDE IS
GOING TO BE BETTER FOR MY FUTURE
IN THIS GAME.
I MEAN, THE WHOLE WORLD IS
PROBABLY SCREAMING, GET OUT THE
POWER COUPLE.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
BUT AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME.
BUT AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
KEN, SO GIVE ME THE LAY OF THE
LAND, BECAUSE JUST ON THE
SURFACE, IT'S EASY THE SAY THREE
MILLENNIALS, TWO GEN-X, ONE OF
YOU ARE GOING HOME.
 YEAH, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT
THERE'S ONLY TWO GEN-X, SO
DEFINITELY THAT'S GOING TO PUT
US ON THE OUTSIDE.
 Jeff: TAYLOR, DO YOU GEE
WITH THAT, THAT ALL THE
MILLENNIALS ARE GOING TO STICK
TOGETHER.
 I WOULD SAY SO, YEAH.
I MEAN, IF YOU CAN HAVE A BOND
LIKE THAT, SO MUCH IS POSSIBLE.
 Jeff: FIGGY, JUST BECAUSE
YOU STARTED WITH TAYLOR AND ADAM
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO GET
ALONG WITH THEM.
 YEAH, EVERYTHING ISN'T ALL
PEACHY WITH ALL THE MILLENNIALS.
FOR INSTANCE, THIS GUY OVER HERE
VOTED FOR ME AT OUR FIRST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, BUT I DON'T HOLD ANY
ANIMOSITY TOWARD HIM.
I LET GO OF THAT.
 Jeff: ADAM, FIGGY SAYS
SHE'S FORGIVEN YOU FOR VOTING
FOR HER AND THAT SHE LOOKS AT
YOU JUST LIKE SHE WOULD LOOK AT
TAYLOR, WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.
 WELL, SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T
LOOK AT ME JUST LIKE SHE WOULD
LOOK AT TAYLOR, LET'S BE VERY
CLEAR ABOUT THAT, WHETHER YOU
WANT TO CALL IT A SHOWMANCE OR A
ROMANCE, SOME KIND OF "MANCE" IS
COMING ON.
 Jeff: TAYLOR, ARE YOU IN
LOVE?
 I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
I THINK THAT'S A STRETCH, BUT,
NO, WE DEFINITELY LIKE EACH
OTHER.
YOUNG LOVE.
 Jeff: KEN, HAVE YOU NOTICED
THIS RELATIONSHIP?
 OH, YEAH.
I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS WHEN
THEY CAME UP TO ME, WE KNOW YOU
PROBABLY DIDN'T CATCH IT, BUT
JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE LIKE EACH
OTHER.
 IS THAT WHAT THEY SAID.
 Jeff: BEING THAT I AM AN
ORDAINED MINISTER, IF I WERE TO
SAY TO YOU, LET'S THROW CAUTION
TO THE WIND AND LET'S GET
MARRIED RIGHT NOW, THE
MILLENNIALS DO THESE THINGS, WE
MARRY YOU RIGHT NOW, I GET THE
LICENSE.
 Jeff: LET'S GO.
 ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.
 Jeff: I WAS JUST SAYING
"SURVIVOR" FIRST.
 Jeff: KEN, WHEN FIGGY SAYS
LET'S GO, SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU
TO STEP IN AND CONFIRM WHAT SHE
JUST SAID, THEREFORE VALIDATING
HER FEELINGS AND MAKING HER FEEL
SAFE AND SECURE IN THIS
WELL-DEVELOPED TWO-WEEK
RELATIONSHIP.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: SO FIGGY, YOU DON'T
SEEM CONCERNED THAT IT'S OUT IN
THE OPEN.
 NO, I MEAN, TAYLOR AND I HAVE
OUR LITTLE THING, BUT WE ALWAYS
WILL SAY IT'S TWO PEOPLE VOTING
TOGETHER.
THOSE ARE TWO PEOPLE VOTING
TOGETHER.
 Jeff: JESSICA AND KEN?
 EXACTLY.
 Jeff: BUT ADAM, THERE WOULD
BE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN KEN
AND JESSICA VOTING TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT'S STRATEGIC, AND
FIGGY AND TAYLOR BECAUSE THEY
LIKE EACH OTHER.
 SURE.
 Jeff: FIGGY YOU ACT LIKE
THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING YOU
EVER HEARD.
 YEAH, WE DIDN'T COME HERE FOR
THIS.
THIS JUST HAPPENED.
WE'RE STILL BEING VERY STRATEGIC
NICK EVERY MOVE WE MAKE.
 Jeff: TAYLOR, IS IT EASIER
TO BE HONEST WITH YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU HAVE THE
LUXURY OF THE NUMBERS?
 YES, IT DEFINITELY IS.
IF YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS, WE CAN
GO, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS WHAT
IT IS.
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, I CAN
JUST WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN.
 Jeff: WOW.
 BUT NUMBERS CAN CHANGE AT ANY
TIME IN THIS GAME.
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT AS BLACK AND
WHITE AS GEN-X AND MILLENNIALS.
 Jeff: SO AM DAM, WE HAVE
TAYLOR AND FIGGY WHO ARE A
ROMANTIC COUPLE AND JESSICA AND
KENT WHO ARE A STRATEGIC COUPLE
THAT LEAVES YOU IN THE MIDDLE.
 YES.
I THINK THAT SOUNDS RIGHT, JEFF.
 Jeff: BUT TAYLOR, ADAM'S
EITHER STICKING WITH THIS THREE
OR HE'S JOINING JESSICA AND KEN.
 HE COULD TOTALLY FLIP ON US
RIGHT NOW.
BUT COME THE MERGE, THE
MILLENNIALS ALREADY HAVE THE
NUMBERS, AND THEY COULD LOOK AT
HIM AND GO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MAN?
BOOT HIS ASS OUT.
 Jeff: YOU WERE PRETTY CLEAR
JUST THEN IN SAYING, IF ADAM
FLIPS ON THE MILLENNIALS, YOU
WILL BOOT HIS ASS OUT.
 I THINK MILLENNIALS AS A
WHOLE WOULD.
 Jeff: ADAM, THAT ARGUMENT
HAS TO HAVE CROSSED YOUR MIND.
 SURE, OF COURSE.
TONIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT
TONIGHT.
I'M LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE.
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WHATEVER
FOUR COMES OUT OF TONIGHT CAN BE
A FOUR.
 Jeff: JESSICA, SO IF THESE
THREE ARE STAYING TRUE, THERE'S
VERY LITTLE FOR YOU TO DO.
 I WAS SURPRISED THERE WAS
CONTENTIOUSNESS WITHIN THAT
TRIBE.
IF YOU MAKE THE MERGE, IT'S
STILL GOING TO BE THERE.
 Jeff: FIGGY, THAT GOT A
REACTION FROM YOU?
 I FEEL LIKE IT'S TUG-OF-WAR
RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: OVER ADAM?
 YEAH.
ALMOST.
IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER WHERE THE NUMBERS LIE.
 JEFF, I HAVE ONE MORE THING
TO SAY, WHICH IS THE PERSON I'M
VOTING FOR TONIGHT, I GENUINELY
LIKE.
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.
SOMEONE IS GOING TO GO HOME
UPSET TONIGHT, AND SOMEONE IS
GOING TO GO BACK TO CAMP UPSET
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
TIME TO VOTE.
TAYLOR, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE KEN.
FIGGY.
KEN.
TWO VOTES KEN.
FIGGY.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES KEN, TWO
VOTES FIGGY, ONE VOTE LEFT.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VS.
GEN-X," FIGGY.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 I'LL EXPLAIN IF I CAN.
 Jeff: FIGGY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 GOOD LUCK, TAY.
 Jeff: WELL, IT WAS SAID
TONIGHT, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT AND SOMEBODY WILL GO BACK
THE CAMP UNHAPPY.
THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO YOU
DEAL WITH IT?
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," A LOVE-SCORNED
TAYLOR...
 I LIED TO YOU AND I SCREWED
YOU.
 Jeff: SEEKS VENGEANCE.
 I WILL INDUSTRY YOU.
 BUT A NEW POWER COUPLE BEGINS
TO FORM.
 ZEKE, I TRUST YOU A LOT.
 I FOUND THE IDOL.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
HE HAS PUT HIS LIFE IN MY HANDS.
 I CAME IN HERE GUNS BLAZING.
I GUESS IT'S MORE OF A
COMPLIMENT TO BE TAKEN OUT NOW,
OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN OUT
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED IN MY GAME,
BUT I'M BUMMED THAT I DON'T GET
TO BE AROUND TAYLOR.
WE'LL PROBABLY BE REUNITED ONE
DAY, BUT JUST NOT ANY TIME SOON.
