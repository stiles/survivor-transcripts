 --- 

         Jeff: IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
STUNNING PLACES IN THE WORLD,
FIJI.
CRYSTAL-CLEAR WATER, DIVERSE AND
DANGEROUS WILDLIFE.
AND HUNDREDS OF BREATHTAKING
ISLANDS.
THIS WILL BE THE BATTLEGROUND
FOR A "SURVIVOR" CULTURE WAR.
THESE 20 AMERICANS DON'T KNOW IT
YET, BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO TRIBES -- THE
MILLENNIALS RANGING IN AGE FROM
18 TO 31.
 MY GENERATION, IT'S ALL ABOUT
DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, AND
I'VE DONE A LOT.
BEEKEEPER.








I BREWED BEER, SNOWBOARD
INSTRUCTOR.
I'VE GONE THE NORTH DAKOTA.
I'M DEFINITELY A PETER PAN TYPE.
I'LL NEVER GROW UP.
THIS IS WHO I AM AND I CAN'T
CHANGE.
 I PLAY VIDEO GAMES ONLINE FOR
A LIVING, AND AS AN ADULT,
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TOLD, "GROW
UP.
STOP PLAYING.
IT'S IN THE A GAME."
BUT I WANT TO MAKE MY ENTIRE
LIFE ABOUT PLAYING.
"SURVIVOR" IS THE GAME OF GAMES,
AND I AM GOING TO WIN.
 YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ON
SOCIAL MEDIA, ALWAYS ON TWITTER,
BUT I DON'T LIKE BEING TIED TO
MY PHONE.
I GENERALLY RESENT TECHNOLOGY.








I THINK TWITER IS THE WORST
THING EVER INVENTED.
I MEAN, I'M ON TWITTER, BUT I
STILL THINK IT'S HORRENDOUS.
 Jeff: GEN-X, RANGE IN AGE
FROM 33 TO 52.
 I'M AN ATTORNEY, I'M 38 YEARS
OLD, AND I KNOW THE OLDER
GENERATION, THEY TAKE AND THEY
ACTUALLY LISTEN, AND THEY USE
THOSE LIFE EXPERIENCES.
 IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN KNOCKED
DOWN, THEN YOU KNOW HOW TO GET
UP AND FIGHT.
 I HAVE FOUR KIDS, AND I'M
SURPRISED AT THE 25-YEAR-OLD
KIDS THAT LIVE AT HOME AND PLAY
VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY.
AND SO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
A LITTLE BIT MORE KAY -- KAYER
IS RAWER IS RAW.
WHO CARES.
MY PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR IT.
 IT TOOK ME 15 YEARS THE
FINALLY BECOME A WRITER.
I DON'T THINK YOUNGER PEOPLE
WOULD PUT THAT KIND OF TIME INTO
WHATEVER THEIR DREAM IS.
THEY WOULD JUST TRY THE FIND A
NEW DREAM.
 Jeff: TWO GENERATIONS WITH
WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT
APPROACHES TO LIFE.
THEY'LL BE ABANDONED AND LEFT TO
FEND FOR THEMSELVES.
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR
THEY'LL BE VOTED OUT.
IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
TO CLAIM THE $1 MILLION PRIZE.
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE, 1 SURVIVOR.
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO THE 33rd SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: TAKE YOUR NAME.
DON'T OPEN IT YET.
WAIT FOR ME.
VERY EXCITING TIME.
WHICH TRIBE AM I GOING TO BE ON.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY OPEN YOUR BUFFS.
TAKE A SPOT ON YOUR MAT.
SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW TRIBE
MATES.
"SURVIVOR" IS ON.
IF YOU'RE PURPLE, HEAD TO
PURPLE.
IF YOU'RE ORANGE, HEAD TO
ORANGE.
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR BUFFS ON.
IT'S NOT OFFICIAL UNTIL THE BUFF
IS ON THE BODY IN SOME WAY.
 I'M SO HAPPY I HAVE THIS
THING ON MY HEAD.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO ONCE AGAIN SURVIVORS MIXING
THINGS UP.
THIS YEAR IT IS "SURVIVOR:
MILLENNIALS VS. GEN-X."
[APPLAUSE]
 I WAS LIKE, HOLY CRAP, THIS
IS DEFINITELY A WAR BETWEEN
GENERATIONS.
WE'RE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS
RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING.
IT'S CRAZY.
MAY THE BEST GENERATION WIN.
 Jeff: GEN-X BORN BETWEEN
1963 AND '82.
MILLENNIALS BORN BETWEEN 1984
AND 1997.
[CHEERING]
THIS DIVISION GOES A LOT DEEPER
THAN JUST OLD VERSUS YOUNG.
THIS IS TWO VERY DIFFERENT
PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES TO
LIFE, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
TEST THIS SEASON IS WHICH ONE IS
BETTER SUITED TO THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR."
ANYBODY FROM THE MILLENNIALS
WANT TO OWN UP TO BEING THE ONE
BORN IN '97, THE YOUNGEST
PERSON?
NO HESITATION.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 WILL.
 Jeff: WILL.
1997.
SO YOU'RE HOW OLD?
 18.
 Jeff: GRADUATED HIGH
SCHOOL?
 NO, STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.
I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL TO PLAY THIS
GAME.
I'M READY TO PLAY.
 Jeff: THAT IS A FIRST.
OUR FIRST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.
 WOW.
 Jeff: NOW, DOES ANYBODY ON
THE GEN-X TRIBE WANT TO ADMIT TO
BEING THE ONE BORN IN 1963,
MAKING THEM THE OLDEST?
[APPLAUSE]
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 PAUL.
 Jeff: PAUL.
SO, PAUL, WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO
BE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE AT
ONE POINT GEN-X WAS THE
GENERATION THAT WAS TEARING DOWN
THE WALLS AND REBUILDING THE
CULTURE.
NOW YOU'RE THE OLDEST GUY OUT
HERE, AND HERE COME THE HEIR
APPARENTS.
 IN OUR GENERATION, WE DIDN'T
ALWAYS GET A TROPHY.
IN OUR GENERATION, ONLY THE
WINNERS GOT A TROPHY.
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH WITHOUT
AN iPOD AND AN APP FOR THIS
AND AN APP FOR THAT.
YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO WALK TO THE
STORE AN GET MILK.
IT DIDN'T COME IN A DRONE.
 Jeff: WOMAN IN THE FRONT,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 SIESTA KEY.
 Jeff: CECE, YOU WERE NOTING
A LOT.
 YES, EVERYTHING IS HANDED TO
THEM.
WE HAD TO WORK FOR WHAT WE GOT.
 Jeff: YOU IN THE MIDDLE,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 ADAM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
ADAM, SO YOU HEAR THAT, THAT'S
THE RAP ON MILLENNIALS,
PARTICIPATION TROPHIES, WE DON'T
WANT TO WORK.
RING TRUE TO YOU?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK WHEN WE WIN THE FIRST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, WE'LL SEE
WHO HAS TO WORK TO WIN.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL PUT YOU TO YOUR FIRST
TEST.
SCATTERED UP IN THIS JUNGLE AREA
ARE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP
YOU OVER THE NEXT 39 DAYS.
SOME OF THESE ITEMS WILL OFFER
SHORT-TERM VALUE.
OTHER ITEMS WILL OFFER LONG-TERM
VALUE.
IN ADDITION, EACH TRIBE HAS TWO
STATIONS.
YOU'LL CHOOSE ONE ITEM FROM EACH
STATION.
LEAVE THE OTHER ONE BEHIND.
THESE WILL BE YOUR FIRST BIG
DECISIONS IN THIS GAME.
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?
 YES!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.
 GO, MILLENNIALS!
 Jeff: YOU'VE GOT TWO
MINUTES TO GET WHATEVER YOU CAN
ON YOUR MATT.
ONCE IT'S ON YOUR MAT, IT'S
YOURS.
 COME ON, GUYS.
 Jeff: GEN-X MAKING THEIR
FIRST DECISION, TAKING THE POTS
AND UTENSIL, LEAVING THE HAMMER
BEHIND.
YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE
GOING TO IMPACT YOU FOR THE NEXT
39 DAYS.
THERE IS STUFF TO BE FOUND IN
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.
 YOU NEED A HAMMER?
 Jeff: THE MILLENNIALS, HALF
OF THEIR TRIBE MAKING ONE
DECISION.
PEOPLE ALREADY WINDED.
YOU WANT EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TAKE.
THERE ARE ITEMS IN TREES.
THERE ARE ITEMS AT THE BASE OF
TREES.
DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND.
 QUICK, QUICK.
 ON THE FLOOR WAS AN ENVELOPE.
SO I JUST GRABBED IT AND SHOVED
IT IN MY BAG AND KEPT GOING.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOSH, OH, MY
GOSH.
BUT MY HEART WAS POUNDING
BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING GOOD.
 Jeff: GEN-X TAKING THE
FISHING GEAR, LEAVING BEHIND THE
CHICKENS.
30 SECONDS LEFT.
 GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: GET WHAT YOU WANT AND
GET IT ON YOUR MAP.
 ADAM, LET'S GO.
 Jeff: COME BACK FOR MORE IF
YOU RUN OUT.
15 SECONDS LEFT.
GET IT BACK.
THIS IS IT.
MILLENNIALS TOOK THE CHICKENS,
LEAVING THE FISHING GEAR.
VERY BIG DIFFERENCE OUT OF THE
GATE.
GEN-X IS LOOKING LONG TERM.
MILLENNIALS ARE LOOKING SHORT
TERM.
LAST ITEM?
TIME!
THAT'S IT.
DROP YOUR ITEMS.
HEAD BACK TO YOUR MATS.
 CHICKENS IS A GOOD CALL.
 Jeff: LET'S JUST REVIEW THE
BIG CHOICES.
SO YOU GUYS TOOK THE FISHING
GEAR.
PAUL, WHY FISHING GEAR VERSUS
CHICKEN, WHICH ARE RIGHT THERE
READY TO EAT?
 FISHING GEAR IS 39 DAYS.
FISHING GEAR WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT ITEM THAT WE GRABBED.
 Jeff: TAYLOR, YOU GUYS TOOK
CHICKENS.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: WHY?
 WELL, THEY LAY EGGS, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, GEN-X, A MAP TO YOUR
BEACH.
MILLENNIALS, A MAP TO YOUR
BEACH.
BEFORE I SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY,
WE ARE IN THE CYCLONE SEASON
HERE IN FIJI.
IT'S BEEN ROUGH.
WE'RE IN A LULL RIGHT NOW, SO
FORECAST IS FOR ANOTHER BIG
STORM TO HIT SOON.
THIS IS NO HYPE.
IT'S FOR REAL.
THIS SEASON MORE THAN ANY OTHER
YOU NEED TO GET TO CAMP AND
START WORKING ON A SHELTER,
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO NEED
IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.
GOOD LUCK.
 MILLENNIALS VERSUS GEN-X.
THIS IS A WAR BETWEEN
GENERATIONS.
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE ARE
PEOPLE ON THAT GEN-X TRIBE THAT
HAVE SPOKEN THE EXACT SAME WORDS
THAT I HAVE SAID: THIS IS THE
BEST GENERATION EVER.
 WALKING UP THE BEACH AND
SEEING THAT TRIBE FLAG,
EVERYBODY IS SO EXCITED.
EVERYBODY IS REALLY HAPPY TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
AN WE'RE GOING THE PROVE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WRONG ABOUT THEIR
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT
MILLENNIALS.
 MY NAME IS FIGGY.
MY REAL NAME IS JESSICA
FIGUEROA.
 I'M MARI.
I PLAY VIDEO GAMES ON YOUK FOR A
LIVING.
 AS MILLENNIALS, WE'RE ALL
OVER THE MAP.
NO ONE HAS JUST A REGULAR JOB.
I THINK IT'S AMAZING.
 I'M MICHELLE.
I'M 28.
I WORK MISSIONARY WORK WITH A
BIBLE GROUP ORGANIZATION.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT OUR
TRIBE AND OUR GENERATION SEES
THINGS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
WAY, AND AS MILLENNIALS, THAT IS
OUR HUGE ADVANTAGE.
 THERE IS A BUNCH OF DEAD
BAMBOO THAT NEEDS TO BE THE
BOTTOM LAYER.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I'VE GOT AN AWESOME TRIBE.
THERE'S ONE GUY I CONNECT WITH
REALLY WELL IN JAY.
HE'S GOING TO BE A BRO.
 A BEAM ACROSS THE TREES THIS
WAY.
 THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
EARLIER, BUT...
 AREN'T YOU SMART.
 AND THEN I DEFINITELY HIT IT
OFF WITH FIG BECAUSE SHE'S
PRETTY DANG CUTE.
 I'LL MAKE THE FIRE.
 MAYBE POCKET LINT.
IT LIGHTS LIKE THAT.
 THAT JEDI BRAIN.
 AND ALSO MICHELLE IS COOL,
AND THEY'RE BOTH REALLY GOOD
LOOKING.
AND I AM A SUCKER FOR PRETTY
GIRL, SO I ALREADY HAVE A
CONNECTION WITH THESE PEOPLE
HERE.
 I AM SO EXCITED.
THIS IS CRAZY.
 I'M JUST SAYING, I'M WITH A
BUNCH OF MILLENNIALS.
I'M A 28 YEAR OLD.
I HAVE NEVER CALLED MYSELF A
MILLENNIALS ONCE IN MY ENTIRE
LIFE.
I'M NOT DRESSED FOR THE YOUTH
PARADE.
I'M DRESSED FOR THE SINGLES
MIXER AT THE MIAMI RETIREMENT
CENTER.
LIKE I'M AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN AT
HEART.
THIS IS LIKE CLEANING MY ROOM
BACK HOME.
OH, NO, WHERE TO START, DUDE.
I'M ON A TRIBE WITH CHILDREN.
WHEN I LOOKED AROUND AND I SAW
ALL OF THESE KIDS.
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT NONE OF
THESE KIDS HAVE EVER HAD IN
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES?
A REAL JOB.
THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
 HOME SWEET HOME, GUYS.
 GREAT JOB, EVERYBODY.
[APPLAUSE]
 EXCELLENT.
 I EXPECT GEN-XERS TO BE
GEN-XERS.
I EXPECT THEM TO BE PEOPLE OF MY
CALIBER, PEOPLE BROUGHT UP IN MY
ERA.
THEY WORK HARD, GOOD, CORE
VALUES WITH THEIR FAMILIES, VERY
STRONG OPINIONS, BUT BASED ON
SOUND DECISION MAKING.
 HEY, GUYS, ONE SECOND, HUH.
BEING I'M THE OLD GUY HERE, I
JUST WANTED TO SAY, THE WAY JEFF
SET THESE TRIBES UP, IT CHANGED
OUR ODDS DRAMATICALLY,
DRAMATICALLY.
IT WENT FROM BEING THAT, WOW, I
HOPE IT'S NOT TO, HOLY CRAP, I
GOT THINKERS HERE AND PEOPLE
THAT KNOW HOW TO BUILD AND
PEOPLE...
 OUR GENERATION, OUR PARENTS
TAUGHT US HUMILITY, SO WE CAN'T
UNDERESTIMATE THOSE KIDS.
THEY'RE SHARP, THEY'RE BRIGHT.
WE WERE WORKING WITH OUR HANDS
GROWING UP.
THEY WERE WORKING WITH THEIR
MINDS.
WE CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THEM.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ENEMY,
YOU GET YOUR ASS WHOOPED.
 RIGHT.
 REAL QUICK, I LIVED THE LAST
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OFF THE
GRID LITERALLY IN THE JUNGLE ON
MAUI, SO AS FAR AS HOW TO SET UP
CAMP, KNOWING THE ENVIRONMENT,
WHERE FOOD IS AT, LET ME HELP
WITH THAT.
TO ME THIS IS HOME.
I WANT TO HELP KIND OF GUIDE MY
TEAM IN THE DIRECTION I THINK IS
NECESSARY BUT DO SO AS THE GUY
WHO IS SUPPORTING, UPLIFTING AND
THEY KNOW THAT I'VE GOT THEIR
BACK.
 SET YOURSELF UP FOR NOW.
 DO YOU WANT TO DO AN A-FRAME
SHELTER?
THIS AREA IS NICE.
 YOU GUYS CAN GET STARTED.
LET'S GET ALL THE DEBRIS OUT
INTO A PILE.
AS IT DRIES, WE CAN ALSO USE IT
FOR KINDLING.
 WHEN I WAS RUNNING AROUND THE
GRAB ITEMS, I FOUND SOMETHING IN
A NICE LITTLE ENVELOPE.
 WE NEED MORE BAMBOO?
 YES.
 THIS IS "SURVIVOR."
IT'S A GAME OF ANY NUMBER OF
WONDERFUL THINGS.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FIND ME
WITH IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT
WOULD THEN PUT A TARGET ON MY
BACK.
WOULD THEN PUT A TARGET ON MY
BACK.
 IF YOU ARE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN
"SURVIVOR" THERE IS A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
IF I AM STILL HERE ON DAY 36, I
WILL RECEIVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
I WILL BE HERE ON DAY 36, SO NO
ONE ELSE IS GETTING THIS BUT ME.
 I WANT THE NAME ONE CHICKEN.
 I DON'T WANT TO NAME HIM
AFTER TAI BECAUSE THEN I CAN'T
KILL HIM.
 TAYLOR, ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE
ME A HAND WITH THE CHICKENS?
 BACK HOME I'M THE CENTER OF
ATTENTION.
I AM A FLIRTY GIRL, AND I'M GOOD
AT MANIPULATING MEN.
PEOPLE THINK THAT I'M JUST A
PRETTY FACE, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW
THE BRAINS BEHIND THE FACE.
MAYBE I'LL END UP GETTING THE $1
MILLION CHECK AND I'LL GET A
HUSBAND.
 THERE'S MORE STUFF WE HAVE TO
GET ON THE BEACH.
 WHERE IS EVERYBODY AT?
I DON'T LIKE THE BREAKUP.
I DON'T LIKE NOT KNOWING WHERE
EVERYBODY IS.
 ME YOU AND HIM ARE PRETTY
GOOD.
 I KNOW.
 WE JUST NEED THREE MORE.
 BUT I DON'T PLAN ON LOSING TO
OLD PEOPLE.
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH
US THREE.
JAY AND I HAD A CONNECTION RIGHT
OFF THE BACK, AND TAYLOR IS MY
BLUE-EYED BEAUTY, AND I THINK
HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE.
 I'M TIRED, MAN.
MY HANDS ARE SHAKING.
 AND I KNEW THOSE TWO BOYS ARE
TIGHT, SO OF COURSE I WANT TO BE
PART OF THAT.
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING
STRONG.
 WE'RE INVINCIBLE.
WE'RE LIKE THE TRI-FORCE.
 I LOVE TAYLOR.
HE'S MY BOY.
I CALL HIM TAILS BECAUSE HE'S
LIKE MY HOMEBOY FROM HOME.
HE'S LIKE, BRO, THE WAVES ARE
FIRING, LET'S GO HANG OUT.
 WE COULD GET MICHELLE.
 WHO IS MICHELLE?
 MICHELLE IS THE ONE THAT
TRAVELS.
 CHRISTIAN.
 YEAH, YEAH, WE GOT MICHELLE.
 AND THEN FIGGY IS A COOL
CHICK.
TAILS AND FIGGY, THEY'RE MY
GO-TOES.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM.
AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.
 ME AND YOU, FOR SURE.
 AND THEN I GOT NAMASTE, HER
NAME IS MICHELLE.
I KNOW WE'RE COOL.
SHE'S A FRICKEN HOT GIRL, BY THE
WAY, SUPER HOT.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ONE
THING, PEOPLE SAY WHEN I SLEPT
LIKE A BABY, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
AROUND BABIES, AND THEY DON'T
SLEEP AT ALL, MAN.
THEY SLEEP LIKE CRAP.
 SO LOOKING AROUND, IT MAKES
ME NERVOUS SEEING JUST LIKE ALL
THE BEAUTIFUL FACES BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO BE THE OBVIOUS
FIRST OUT, BUT IT'S HARD WHEN
YOU DON'T INSTANTLY FIT IN.
 WAIT.
MICHELLE.
OKAY.
SO YOU DO MISSIONARY BIBLE
THINGS.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S NEAT.
THAT'S COOL.
 ESSENTIALLY I'M A RECRUITER.
 HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM?
BIBLE, HERE YOU GO.
I'M LIKE A JEW WHO KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT THE BIBLE.
 I THINK PEOPLE SEE ME AS
TRUTHFUL, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF MY
FAITH, SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
COMING UP TO ME, YOU KNOW, JAY
AND I HAVE MADE A LITTLE BOND.
I'VE ALSO HAD HANNAH TELL ME
SHE'LL TRUST ME, AND IN THIS
GAME, HAVING PEOPLE TRUST YOU
AND MAYBE VIEW YOU AS SOMEONE
WHO REALLY DOES CARE FOR THEM,
THAT'S VERY BENEFICIAL.
WHO REALLY DOES CARE FOR THEM,
THAT'S VERY BENEFICIAL.
 YOU AND ME ARE DOING FINE.
WE'LL DIG IT DOWN, AND THEN WE
CAN BUILD IT UP.
 HOW BIG OF A PIT DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE?
 I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT...
 HOW FAR DOWN DO YOU WANT TO
DIG IT?
 NOT THAT FAR.
 HOW FAR IS NOT THAT FAR,
LIKE...
 SIX INCHES.
 SIX INCHES.
I'M GOING TO GET SOME SMALL
PIECES...
 THIS IS NOT SIX INCHES.
WE NEED TO KEEP DIGGING.
SEE, WE'RE IN BUSINESS NOW.
 WE ARE.
 YOU LIKE TO PLAY MORE THAN
WORK, YOU.
 WHO DOES?
 YOU, YOU, YOU.
YOU LIKE TO JOKE AROUND.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'RE FOCUSED.
 REALLY?
 OH, YEAH.
 RACHEL IS DEFINITELY
OVEREAGER.
SHE'S OVERLY CONFRONTATIVE.
WHEN YOU'RE IN A GROUP SETTING,
IT CAN REALLY BRING A LOT OF
NEGATIVITY TO THE GROUP, AND
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT.
 WILL YOU GO DO WHAT YOU WERE
ORIGINALLY GOING TO DO, WHICH IS
GET THOSE STICKS FOR THE FIRE?
 I BELIEVE WHAT NEEDS THE
HAPPEN IS ME AND YOU NEED TO GET
A MACHETE AND JUST BUILD THIS
DAMN THING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF TALKING GOING ON AND IN THE A
LOT OF DOING.
SO WE NEED FOUR CORNERS
OBVIOUSLY.
I THINK WE NEED ONE IN THE
MIDDLE, ON EACH SIDE, THAT'S
SIX.
 FULL DISCLOSURE, I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY BUILT A SHELTER BEFORE,
BUT I TAKE GREAT DIRECTIONS.
 WELCOME TO THE CLUB, PAL.
 I DON'T REALLY LIKE SLEEPING
OUTSIDE, I DON'T LIKE BUG, I
DON'T LIKE THE SUN, I DON'T LIKE
WATER, I DON'T LIKE THE OCEAN.
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE
TERRIBLE.
WHAT I DO LOVE IS THE GAME PLAY.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
 JUST WHACK IT?
 YEAH, WHACK IT.
YOU GOT THE WHACK IT PRETTY
GOOD.
 RIGHT PAST THE JOINT.
 DAVE IS JUST AFRAID OF HIS
OWN SHADOW.
I WAS CHOPPING THE BAMBOO, AND
HE WAS JUMPING UP AND COVERING
HIS EARS LIKE IT WAS TOO LOUD.
COVER YOUR EARS.
 YOU GOT TO MAN UP.
THERE'S GIRLS WITH MORE
TESTOSTERONE BACK AT THAT CAMP
THAN HE'S GOT.
 GUYS?
I THINK THEY MAY HAVE FOUND THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL BECAUSE
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEIR
HAND AND I THINK THEY HAVE IT.
 WHO'S THAT?
 THAT'S KEN AND PAUL.
 YOU THINK SO?
 I DO THINK SO.
I THINK WE SHOULD AMBUSH THAT
RIGHT NOW.
IS THAT WEIRD?
IT'S JUST BETTER IF WE ALL KNOW
IT.
 I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE IT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY HAVE
IT.
 THAT THING IN HIS LEFT HAND.
 HE SURE ISN'T HIDING IT.
HE'S BEEN CASUAL.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE IT
OBVIOUS.
 NO, THEY WOULD BE RUNNING OFF
INTO THE WOODS.
 I DON'T MEAN TO BE THE
PARANOID GUY, BUT THIS IS JUST
TOTALLY SUSPECT.
 KEEP AN EYE ON THAT LEFT
HAND.
IF HE COMES BACK WITH
SOMETHING...
 IF HE COMES BACK WITH
NOTHING.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
 IF HE COMES BACK WITH
SOMETHING...
 IF HE COMES BACK WITH
NOTHING, HE'S GOT AN IDOL.
 DAVE GOT REAL PARANOID.
HE'S ALSO SCARED.
HE'S FUNNY AT TIMES AND
CHARMING.
 I LIKE YOU, I TRUST YOU.
IF I HEAR YOUR NAME COME UP, I'M
GOING TO TELL YOU.
CHRIS, CHRIS, CHRIS, CHRIS, I
TRUST YOU.
IF I HEAR YOUR NAME COME UP, I'M
COMING FOR YOU.
PLEASE DO THE SAME FOR ME.
 BUT DON'T BE... BE NICE.
 IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
 HE'S TRYING WAY TOO HARD.
HE'S SCRAMBLING AROUND AND
TALKING STRATEGY, AND I THINK
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY TO BE
PUSHING TOO HARD.
 FUNNY HOW THE GAME'S ALREADY
STARTED.
 I KNOW.
 A LITTLE PARANOID.
IT'S GOT ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
 THE WIND IS PICKING UP.
 I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A
GREAT SIGN.
 UH-OH.
 THAT'S A REALLY BAD SIGN.
 HEADING INTO THE FIRST NIGHT,
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE,
OH, MAN, WE'RE IN A WORLD OF
HURT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR
SHELTER.
WE HAVE NO REAL ROOF.
BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS
TRIBE THINKS EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.
 ARE WE GOING NAKED?
NO, WE'RE NOT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I'M TELLING YOU GUYS FROM
EXPERIENCE, NOT A GOOD IDEA.
 BUT WE'RE YOUNG MILLENNIALS.
WE DON'T CARE.
 EVERYBODY'S SO EXCITED.
EVERYBODY'S REALLY HAPPY TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
 I'M LOOKING UP AT THE SKY.
IT'S GETTING DARK.
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
NOBODY SEEMS TO REALLY CARE.
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GEN-Xs AND MILLENNIALS,
GEN-Xs BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO PUT
IN YOUR TIME TO GET TO WHERE YOU
HAVE TO BE.
MILLENNIALS DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
THEY BELIEVE IF YOU SET TO YOUR
MIND TO SOMETHING AND YOU DREAM
BIG, YOU CAN GO AND ACCOMPLISH
IT NOW.
 MAMA SAYS COME BACK IN NOW.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
 ALL OF OUR PROJECTS ARE LIKE
HALF-WAY DONE.
 WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY
ON THE BEACH.
AND THEN WE REALIZE IT'S GOING
TO GET DARK.
SO WE RUSH BACK BECAUSE THE
SHELTER IS UNBUILT.
 ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WE START OFF TRYING TO KEEP
OURSELVES DRY WITH PALM FRONDS
BECAUSE WE THINK RAIN IS COMING.
JAY AND I WERE TRYING TO TIE THE
ROOF TOGETHER.
OUR SHELTER WAS DEFINITELY ONE
OF THE WORST IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR."
 OKAY.
JUST BE CAREFUL.
BE CAREFUL.
WE ALL GO INTO THE SHELTER.
BUT WHEN WEIGHT WENT ON IT, IT
WAS SINKING.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 NO, NO.
 THERE'S A WEIGHT LIMIT
APPARENTLY.
 IT EVENTUALLY CRACKED.
AND I'M THINKING THE MYSELF,
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO
GET THIS SHELTER FINISHED IN
TIME.
 I'M SO SCARED THAT OUR
SHELTER IS NOT GOOD.
 NO, IT'S NOT, BUT WE'LL
SURVIVE.
WE WILL BE OKAY.
WE WILL SURVIVE TONIGHT.
 DUDE, THIS IS GOING TO BE SO
RAD.
 WE'RE TERRIFIED BECAUSE IT'S
POURING RAIN, AND WE DON'T HAVE
A SHELTER.
WE'RE JUST SITTING IN THE RAIN
LIKE FREEZING COLD.
IT'S JUST THE HARDEST THING I'VE
EVER BEEN THROUGH.
IT'S THE LONGEST NIGHT EVER.
I AM SHAKING.
AND YOU COULD FEEL PEOPLE
MENTALLY BREAKING DOWN.
YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S ENDLESS.
I COULD HEAR THE BOOMING, THE
THUNDER AND THE LIGHTNING, AND
WE SAW THE STORM FROM FAR OUT IN
THE WATER MAKING ITS WAY TO US.
IT WAS LIKE THIS MONSTER WAS
COMING TO GET US AND PUNISH US
FOR NOT BUILDING A SHELTER.
 IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS IS
GOING ANYWHERE.
 WE NEED TO GET GOING ON THIS,
MAN.
 I GUESS WE GOT TO SPLIT
THESE.
 WHAT A MISERABLE DAY.
 OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
 WE JUST HAD BASICALLY A NIGHT
OF HELL.
 WOW.
 AND WE DIDN'T GET OUR SHELTER
COMPLETELY MADE IN TIME, AND IT
STARTED RAINING.
 OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO COLD.
 AND IT NEVER STOPPED.
AND IT NEVER STOPPED.
AND IT NEVER STOPPED RAINING!
AND IT'S STILL RAINING.
 OH, YEAH, THIS ONE, THAT
BENDS THAT WAY.
THIS ISN'T THE BEST PALM FRONTD
EITHER I GUESS.
I'M SORRY.
 TREE MAIL AND A PACKAGE.
 OH, GOD.
IS IT A TARP?
 IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A
TARP.
 TREE MAIL, GUYS.
EVERYONE, COME ON.
IT'S THE FIRST ONE.
 TREE MAIL.
 TREE MAIL.
 ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL
STORM AND IT'S GOING TO LAST A
BIT LONGER.
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH
TIME TO BUILD A SHELTER, SO AS A
GESTURE OF GOODWILL, I'M
OFFERING THIS TARP AS PROTECTION
UNTIL YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN.
WHEN THE WEATHER CLEARS, BRING
IT BACK THE ME.
IF I HAVE TO COME LOOKING FOR
IT, IT WILL COST YOU MORE THAN
JUST THE TARP.
GOOD LUCK AND TRY TO STAY DRY.
JEFF.
[CHEERING]
 I DON'T THINK THEY KNEW IT
WAS COMING.
 SO PUT THAT ON TOP OF THE
PALM FRONDS?
 I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE A
TRIBE WAS ACTUALLY GIVE AN TARP.
 I'LL TIE THIS HERE.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT SOME OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE MADE OF.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT
"SURVIVOR" SEASON, IN MY
OPINION.
I THINK THIS WEATHER IS GOING TO
BE SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US
WERE PREPARED FOR.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
 AS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL, I'M
OFFERING THIS TARP AS PROTECTION
UNTIL YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN.
GOOD LUCK, AND TRY AND STAY DRY.
XOXO, JEFF.
HE DOESN'T SAY XOXO.
 MAN, YOU KNOW IT'S BAD WHEN
JEFF GIVES YOU A TARP.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WIN THE
TARP.
IT JUST COMES IN A TREE MAIL.
THAT'S WHEN WE ALSO KNEW, THE
WEATHER'S GOING TO GET WORSE, SO
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
 ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS WANT TO
KICK ASS ON THE SHELTER?
 YEAH!
 HERE WE GO.
 WATCH YOUR HEADS, WATCH YOUR
HEADS.
 I WOULD RATE OUR CAMP AT LIKE
PIGPEN LEVEL.
IT IS JUST LIKE A MUD FLAT WITH
STICKS OF BAMBOO STUCK HAPHAZARD
ABOUT.
I'M THINKING, GREAT, WE'LL BUILD
A BASE.
WE HAVE A TARP.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS BAD AS
LAST NIGHT.
IT'S HARD, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE
RAIN NEVER LETS UP.
AND LAST NIGHT WAS LIKE ONE OF
THE HARDEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT
COULD GET MUCH WORSE THAN THAT.
 THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
 ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S SECURE.
ISH.
 TIGHT, TIGHT.
TIGHT.
PULL.
 OH, WHAT THE...
 WOW.
 SO WE'RE STANDING AROUND IN
THE MUD FROM LAST NIGHT'S STORM,
AND JEFF STROLLS CASUALLY INTO
CAMP, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I'M A
LITTLE NERVOUS.
 Jeff: IS THIS EVIDENCE OF
LAST NIGHT?
 YEAH.
 YES.
 IT'S BEEN ROUGH.
 NOBODY SLEPT.
 WE DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL.
 Jeff: WELL, THE STORM IS
GETTING WORSE, SO WE SENT THE
TARP OVER THIS MORNING, THOUGHT
MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP YOU GUYS
WEATHER IT, BUT IN THE LAST FEW
HOURS, IT'S BEEN UPGRADED AGAIN.
IT IS NOW A CYCLONE.
 OH.
 Jeff: AND THE PREDICTION IS
TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH
HARDER THAN LAST NIGHT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: SO FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 33 SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR,"
WE'RE GOING TO EVACUATE.
 WHOA, WHOA.
OH, MY GOD.
 MY JAW DROPPED.
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE
NEVER SEEN.
THERE HAVE BEEN BAD STORMS ON
"SURVIVOR," BUT WE HAVE NEVER
DONE THIS IN THE HISTORY OF 33
SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR."
 Jeff: SO HERE'S THE DEAL:
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO COLLECT
YOUR PERSONAL ITEMS, GRAB YOUR
CHICKENS, WE DON'T WANT THE
LEAVE THEM OUT HERE.
YOU WANTED ADVENTURE, YOU GOT
IT.
[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
 ARE WE LEAVING NOW?
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE MY
BAG IS.
 WOW.
THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE TOTALLY
DESTROYED.
THIS IS NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES.
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.
THIS IS A REAL CYCLONE, AND
THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AT
STAKE.
 HEADS UP.
 WHAT?
 THERE HE IS, THE MAN OF A
THOUSAND TARPS.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WHEN I SAW JEFF, MY BREATH
COMPLETELY LEFT MY BODY.
 WHAT'S UP, JEFF?
 I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG,
BECAUSE JEFF VERY RARELY COMES
TO CAMP UNLESS IT'S A SAFETY
SITUATION.
 THANK YOU FOR THE TARP.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: YES.
SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT TROPICAL STORM THAT I TOLD
YOU ABOUT YESTERDAY IS GROWING
IN INTENSITY.
IT'S BEEN UPGRADED AGAIN.
 OH.
 Jeff: IT'S A CYCLONE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: SO WE'RE GOING TO
EVACUATE YOU FROM THIS BEACH,
TAKE YOU TO A SAFE SPOT TO WAIT
OUT THE STORM.
 CAN WE GRAB OUR BAGS BEFORE
WE GO?
 PERSONAL ITEMS YOU'LL TAKE
WITH YOU.
EVERYTHING ELSE, WE'LL JUST SEE
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE MORNING.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
 DO WE PUT ALL OUR FOOD AND
STUFF IN THE SHELTER?
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
 IT'S COMING IN.
 THE CYCLONE IS GOING TO BE
HITTING TODAY, AND I'M NOT
SURPRISED ACTUALLY THAT WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE SOME DEVASTATING
WEATHER TONIGHT.
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
BE EVACUATED.
OH, MY GOD.
 HERE WE GO.
 WELCOME, RAIN.
 WHOA!
 Jeff: LET'S GO!
 OH, MY GOSH.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 Jeff: LET'S GO.
GET ON, GET ON, GET ON.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, TREES DOWN.
 YEAH, THAT'S EVERYTHING.
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY HURT.
 ON DAY THREE WE CAME BACK TO
THE CAMP AFTER THE CYCLONE
PASSED, AND EVERYTHING WAS
KNOCKED OVER, AND A TREE
ACTUALLY DID FALL ON TO OUR
SHELTER, SO WE'RE LIKE, OH, MY
GOD, IT'S ALARMLING.
IT'S SCARY.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR
LIVES AND SOMEONE GETTING
INJURED FROM A TREE FALLING
DOWN.
SO IT'S GOOD THAT WE WERE
EVACUATED.
THAT WAS DEFINITELY A SAVING
GRACE THAT JEFF MADE THAT
DECISION TO DO THAT.
 WE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S START MOVING.
 ROGER THAT.
LET'S GET ON IT.
 YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
 FIRST FEW DAYS IN "SURVIVOR"
ARE ALL ABOUT BUILDING A
SHELTER, AND I AM TERRIBLE AT
THAT.
AND I HAD TO DO IT TWICE.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SEES ME
PHYSICALLY STRONG.
I GOT IT.
SO THERE'S NO REASON THAT THEY
WOULD WANT TO KEEP ME OVER
ANYBODY ELSE, AND SO IT'S REALLY
LIKE RESONATING WITH ME, THAT
PARANOIA, THAT NERVOUSNESS, THAT
ANXIETY THAT I'M ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THIS NEUROTIC
GUY.
I WAS BORN AFRAID OF DYING.
I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY.
 SO LIKE IN A PLANE OR
DROWNING...
 PLANE WOULD BE THE WORSE.
BUT JUST DYING IN GENERAL, I
DON'T WANT TO DIE.
WHATEVER.
 BEING OUT HERE REALLY IS LIKE
COMPLETELY...
 I CAME OUT HERE TO EXPAND IT.
THERE'S NO BIGGER WAY TO DO IT
THAN THIS.
 TRYING NEW THINGS.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
 WHOA.
 IT'S A WALKING STICK.
IT CAN'T HURT YOU.
IT JUST WALKS AROUND ON YOU.
 IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?
 NO.
 YOU SURE?
 YEAH.
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH
HOPE FOR ME, BUT I AM A GEN-XER
AND I DON'T GIVE UP.
I'M GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE
THIS HAPPEN.
I'M GOING TO TURN THIS GAME
AROUND FOR MYSELF.
I NEED TO START WORKING REALLY
HARD FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING THAT
THIS SAVE -- THAT CAN SAVE ME.
 DAVE'S LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.
 ON THE BEACH?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO.
 HE WAS UP ON THAT MOUNTAIN
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.
WE GOT THE REIN HIM IN.
 HE'S OUT OF CONTROL.
 HE HAS TO BE AN IDIOT.
HE HAS TO BE AN IDIOT.
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
 DAVID WAS OUT MADLY HUNTING
FOR AN IDOL WHEN WE WERE
BUILDING THE SHELTER, AND THAT
UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE.
IF DAVID HAS AN IDOL, IT
CERTAINLY WOULD COMPLICATE
THINGS MOVING FORWARD, SO IF WE
LOSE, IT'S GOING TO BE DAVID.
 I HAVE AN IDEA FOR THE ROOF.
IF WE CAN GET SOME BAMBOO SLATS
AND TIE THE PALM FRONDS ON TO
THAT.
 OKAY.
 WE GET BACK THE CAMP AND IT'S
A MESS.
WE HAVE A BASE AND A SHELTER AND
WE DON'T HAVE A ROOF.
SO WE NEEDED TO COBBLE THIS
SHELTER TOGETHER.
I LED THE BUILDING OF THE SECOND
SHELTER.
 DO YOU WANT TO HAVE IT THE
SAME WAY IN
 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BUILD A
SHELTER.
I LIVE IN BROOKLYN.
I KNOW HOW THE RIDE THE SUBWAY.
THAT'S THE EXTENT OF MY
OUTDOORSY SKILLS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I STEPPED UP
AND I DID IT.
SO AGAINST ALL ODDS I HAVE
BECOME THE LEADER OF THIS GROUP.
I NEVER THINK OF MYSELF AS THE
PERSON WHO FEELS ADEPT IN THE
OUTDOORS.
 KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
 YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT, YOU
GOT IT.
 I'M NOT THAT KIND OF PERSON,
BUT I'M VERY INTREEPGED BY THE
IDEA OF PROVING HOW TOUGH I AM.
 YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
 YOU GOT IT.
 SO IN A WEIRD WAY, "SURVIVOR"
IS HELPING ME RISE TO MY
POTENTIAL.
 FIRE.
 GO, GO, GO, GO GO,!
 YES.
 WE HAVE FIRE.
WE HAVE FIRE AND I MADE IT.
I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE THE
GUY WHO MAKES FIRE WITHOUT
FLINT.
 YOU DID IT!
 YEAH, BABY.
 I FEEL LIKE A MILESTONE HAS
BEEN REACHED IN MY LIFE, THAT
I'VE BECOME A NEW MAN.
 YOU'RE A FIRE STARTER.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I FEEL LIKE "SURVIVOR"
CHANGES PEOPLE.
I ALREADY FEEL CHANGED.
 NOTHING WILL BE THE SAME.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M GROWING AS A
PERSON OUT HERE.
LIKE I AM AFFECTED BY THIS
EXPERIENCE.
IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY.
AND I'M VERY PROUD HOFF MYSELF
RIGHT NOW.
 I LOVE YOU BOTH.
 I KNOW.
 WE'RE A THREAT, A HUGE ONE.
 I KNOW.
I KNOW.
OKAY.
 HONESTLY, YO, WE'RE SOLID.
THE TRI-FORCE.
I FRICKEN LOVE YOU GUYS.
I FRICKEN LOVE YOU GUYS.
TESTIFY THE TRI-FORCE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GROUP, I
STARTED NOTICING THAT THERE HAS
BEEN THIS DIVISION BETWEEN LIKE
THE HIGH SCHOOL COOL KIDS AND
THE SORT OF WEIRDO NERDS.
AND I DO FEEL LIKE THE MISFITS
SEEM LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON
THE OUTS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
TRIBE SO FAR?
 FIGGY AND THE BOYS ARE A
LOCK, SO I NEED NOW SQUASH THAT
IN THE BUD.
 I NEED ONE IN THIS GAME I CAN
TRUST.
AND I DON'T WANT LIKE THE...
 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
KEEP OUR NUMBERS IN THE
BEGINNING, AND I REALLY DO SEE
IT GOING TWO WAYS, LIKE THE COOL
KIDDOS, AND I THINK IT CAN GO
WEIRDOES.
"FREAKS AND GEEKS."
 FREAKS AND GEEKS, THAT'S A
GOOD WAY TO PUT IT.
THE GOOD-LOOKING, POPULAR GROUP
IS ISOLATING THEMSELVES FROM THE
ENTIRE TRIBE.
SO WE NEED THE TEAR APART THAT
POPULAR GROUP.
 I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME
WITH THE MISFITS.
MY GOAL IS TO PLAY LIKE I WOULD
PLAY VIDEO GAMES, SO AT THIS
POINT I'M PULLING TOGETHER THE
MISFITS AND KIND OF THE
OUTCASTS.
THEY'RE ICE LETTING THEMSELVES
IN A GROUP OF FOUR.
SO I STARTED PUTTING INTO
PEOPLE'S EARS THAT THE FOUR
PRETTY PEOPLE ARE INSEPARABLE.
 THEY'RE RUNNING THE SHOW.
 THAT'S DANGEROUS.
SO WHILE WE HAVE ALL THE
NUMBERS, THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY
TO STRIKE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE
BOTH TRIBES BROUGHT THEIR TARPS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU CAN DROP THOSE, LEAVE THEM
BEHIND.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: THIS IS WHAT YOU
COVET IN THIS GAME.
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
WITH THIS IN YOUR POSSESSION,
YOU ARE SAFE.
WITHOUT IT, YOU COULD BE VOTED
OUT.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE CHOICES THAT WILL
HELP YOU AT EITHER THE FRONT END
OR THE BACK END OF THE
CHALLENGE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU'LL RACE UNDER AN OBSTACLE
AND RETRIEVE A WAR CLAW.
YOU'LL THEN COME A ROPE TUNNEL,
WHICH YOU CAN CROSS AS IS OR USE
A SHORTCUT.
THAT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER.
YOU'LL THEN COME TO A BALANCE
BEACH.
YOU CAN RUN IT AS IS OR USE A
SHORTCUT, MAKING IT MUCH EASIER.
YOU'LL THEN CARRY A CRATE TO THE
FINISH AND USE THE PIECES INSIDE
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
HERE'S THE DILEMMA: EVERY TIME
YOU USE A SHORTCUT, IT ADDS TEN
MORE PIECES TO THE PUZZLE.
SO IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GREAT AS
PUZZLES.
YOU MIGHT WANT THE TAKE THE
SHORTCUT, SPRINT TO THE END AND
GET WORKING ON IT AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE.
IF YOU'RE NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE
PUZZLE, YOU MAY HAVE TO RUN THE
COURSE AS IS, KNOWING YOU'LL BE
BEHIND, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN
CATCH UP WITH A SHORTER PUZZLE.
THIS CHALLENGE WILL COME DOWN TO
WHICH GROUP IN THE FIRST FEW
DAYS HAS LEARNED THE STRENGTHS
AND WEAKNESSES OF THEIR TRIBE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, PLUS FIRE IN
THE FORM OF FLINT.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
MILLENNIALS VS. GEN-X."
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
 WHO IS GETTING THE CLUB?
 I WILL.
I'M GOING TO DO THE BIG ONE.
 YOU SURE?
 WHO IS DOING THE PUZZLE AT
THE END?
 ME AND RACHEL BOTH.
 UNLESS ANYONE ELSE IS REALLY
GOOD?
 I THINK WE NEED THE TAKE A
SHORTCUT ON THE BALANCE BEAM.
 WITHOUT EVEN TRYING?
 I AGREE WITH THAT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY AND
FIRE, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST STEP IS TO UNTIE ALL OF
YOUR CLUBS, TWO ON EITHER SIDE.
 GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: ALREADY A FIGHT GOING
ON UNDERNEATH.
JAY AND CHRIS GOING AT IT.
YOU GOT TO UNTIE ALL OF YOUR
CLUBS, THOSE HERE AND THOSE
ALONG THE POSTS.
GO TO YOUR MAT, WAIT FOR
EVERYBODY.
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE THERE WITH
ALL YOUR CLUBS.
CHRIS BLOCKING TWO MILLENNIALS
BY HIMSELF.
THEY CAN'T GET TO THEIR CLUBS.
GOT TO HAVE ALL YOUR TRIBE
MEMBERS TOGETHER.
 GOT 'EM ALL?
 Jeff: WE GOT A FIGHT GOING
ON.
 ON THE MAT.
 Jeff: GO, GEN-X, GO!
 GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: GEN-X GOING TO TAKE
FIRST SHORTCUT.
RACHEL SPENDING A LOT OF TIME.
THAT'S GOOD.
GO!
MILLENNIALS NOT TAKING ANY
SHORTCUTS.
 WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS.
 GO.
 Jeff: OUT OF THE GATE,
GEN-X TAKES THAT FIRST OBSTACLE
MUCH EASIER, A WISE CHOICE GIVEN
THE SIZE OF THE BODIES THEY
HAVE.
MILLENNIALS MUCH SMALLER.
 WE DON'T NEED IT.
 THEY'RE GOING TO GO WITHOUT
TAKING A SHORTCUT.
 Jeff: GEN-X, THEY HAVE GOT
A LEAD RIGHT NOW.
 OUCH, OUCH, OUCH.
 Jeff: HERE COMES PAUL, THE
BIGGEST GUY, GETTING THROUGH
THERE LAST.
GO, GEN-X!
 COME ON.
 Jeff: GEN-X GOING THE TAKE
THE SECOND SHORT.
GO.
GEN-X TAKING BOTH SHORTCUTS
STRAIGHT ACROSS, LET'S GO, LET'S
GO, LET'S GO.
MILLENNIALS FIRST WORKING ON
THAT FIRST ONLY, REGRETTING NOW
MAYBE NOT TAKING THE SHORTCUT.
HUGE LEAD FOR GEN-X.
GEN-X NOW MOVING TO THAT LAST
STATION.
THEY'LL BE WORKING ON THE MOST
DIFFICULT PUZZLE.
LET'S GO, MILLENNIALS.
THERE IT IS, MILLENNIALS GOING
TO TAKE THE SECOND SHORTCUT.
 TURN IT, TURN IT, TURN IT.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: GEN-X TOOK BOTH
SHORTCUTS.
THEY'LL BE WORKING ON A 70-PIECE
PUZZLE.
THE MILLENNIALS TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ONE SHORTCUT.
THEY'LL BE WORKING ON A 60-PIECE
PUZZLE.
THEY HAVE TEN LESS PIECES IN
THEIR PUZZLE.
GEN-X HAS TEN MORE PIECES NOW.
THEIR PUZZLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
DIFFICULT.
 THEY'RE WAY BEHIND.
THEY HAVE SO MANY MORE PIECES
THAN US.
 Jeff: IT IS DAVID AND
RACHEL AND IT IS MICHELLE AND
FIGGY.
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO HOW
FAST YOU CAN SOLVE THIS PUZZLE.
 COME ON, GUYS, YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS STARTING
TO GET SOME MOMENTUM NOW.
 GOOD JOB, FIGGY.
 Jeff: I SEE THEIR PUZZLE
TAKING SHAPE.
DAVID AND RACHEL HAVE SQUANDERED
THE LEAD THAT THE SHORTCUTS GAVE
THEM.
 YOU GUYS SEE ANYTHING, LET ME
KNOW.
 WE CAN'T REALLY SEE.
YOU WANT TO SWITCH OUT?
 YEAH, GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: DAVID AND RACHEL OUT.
JESSICA AND SUNDAY NOW IN TRYING
TO MAKE UP A LOT OF LOST TIME.
 GOOD JOB, FIGGY.
 YEAH, GUYS.
 Jeff: MORE PROGRESS BY THE
MILLENNIALS.
 COME ON, MAKING SOME
PROGRESS.
 Jeff: GEN-X STARTING TO
MAKE PROGRESS.
STARTING TO TAKE SHAPE.
MILLENNIALS DOWN TO THEIR LAST
SEVERAL PIECES.
GEN-X DESPERATELY TRYING THE
CATCH UP.
 ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT.
 Jeff: RACHEL OFFERING A LOT
OF HELP FROM THE SIDELINE.
SHE WAS FIRST IN, COULDN'T GET
ANYTHING DONE.
 NOT ANYTHING?
I DID SOMETHING.
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS GETTING
CLOSER TO THE FINISH.
 THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE.
YEAH!
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS WIN THE
FIRST IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SENDING A SIGNAL TO GEN-X.
 ONE, TWO, THREE...
 MILLENNIALS!
 Jeff: MILLENNIALS,
CONGRATULATIONS.
FIRST IMMUNITY.
WHO WANTS IT?
[CHEERING]
CONGRATULATIONS.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THE
MILLENNIALS TRIBE.
IN ADDITION, FIRE IN THE FORM OF
FLINT.
 NOT THAT WE NEEDED IT.
 Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 Jeff: GEN-X, FOR ONE OF
YOU, THIS WILL BE THE END OF THE
ROAD.
TONIGHT SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.
THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT,
NOBODY WANTS IT TO BE THEM.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 THE CHALLENGE DID NOT GO HOW
WE HOPED.
IT WAS JUST A DISASTER.
RACHEL'S BARKING OFF ORDERS.
DAVE TOLD US HE WAS THE SUPREME
PUZZLE MAKER AND THEY FAILED ON
IT, SO THOSE TWO ARE ON THE
HATCHET.
 I WANTED TO BEAT
THE MILLENNIALS IS BAD.
AND I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WE
WOUND.
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE.
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WE WERE
GOING TO OUTSHINE THEM TODAY,
AND I'M SHOCKED THAT WE DIDN'T.
 LET'S NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.
 AGREED.
 THEY'RE QUICK.
THEY'RE SHARP.
BUT WE HAVE STRATEGIZED THE
BEGINNING OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE GOT SCREWED UP ON THE PUZZLE.
 AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
RACHEL TELLS EVERYONE THAT SHE
CAN DO PUZZLES, PUZZLES ARE HER
THING, AND SHE SCREWS IT ALL UP.
 I'M GOING TO GET WATER.
DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT ME TO FILL
THEIR WATER?
YOU WANT TO COME?
OKAY, GOOD.
 WE NEED TO GO DOWN AND GET
WATER.
LET'S GO DOWN AND GET WASHED
OFF.
 WE HAVE TO WIN CHALLENGES.
 WELL, THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT
OF IT, WE WERE ALL RIGHT THERE.
 AND YOU TWO, I'M SORRY, YOU
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT PUZZLE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU REALLY
WERE GOING TO GET IT IF YOU HAD
A LITTLE MORE TIME.
 IF YOU SAY I'LL DO THE PUZZLE
AND YOU DON'T DO IT GOOD, THEN
YOU'RE OUT.
 IF SOMEONE DOESN'T DO WELL IN
THE CHALLENGE, IT'S ALWAYS GOING
TO MAGNIFY THAT PERSON.
THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE
BEAST HERE.
 SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE VOTING FOR RACHEL, BUT MY
FEAR OBVIOUSLY IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, IF ANYBODY HAS
IT.
WE'RE SOLID, RIGHT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 ALL RIGHT.
 EVERYBODY HAS BEEN
STRATEGIZING AND NOT INCLUDING
ME IN ON ANY OF IT.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THIS
POINT TRUSTS ME.
I KNOW THE POSITION THAT I'M IN,
IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.
I'M ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
I THINK I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 HEY, GUYS, I'D LOVE TO TALK.
 I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.
 RIGHT.
 AND I'M WILLING TO WRITE DOWN
WHOSE EVER NAME YOU WANT ME TO.
 I WANT TO KNOW 100% YOU DON'T
HAVE AN IDOL.
 100% I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.
BELIEVE ME, IF I DID I WOULD
PLAY IT.
 I WAS GOING THE MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU IF YOU HAD ONE.
 I DON'T HAVE ONE.
SO I DON'T GET A DEAL.
I FEEL LIKE YOU THINK I HAVE ONE
BUT I REALLY DON'T.
 I KNOW THAT'S THE CHATTER
THAT YOU HAVE ONE.
 FULL DISCLOSURE, I'M GOING
THE LAY IT ALL OUT, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN MY
HEAD.
I GOT A LITTLE PARANOID AND THEN
I FELT LIKE I JUST WASN'T BEING
INCLUDED IN ON ANY STRATEGY OR
WHATEVER, AND WHEN I DID WAS,
YEAH, I WENT DOWN HERE AND I WAS
SNOOPING AROUND HOPING TO FIND
SOMETHING I COULD FIND.
YOU CAN WRITE MY NAME DOWN IF
YOU WANT, IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
I HOPE YOU DON'T, IF YOU DON'T,
YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY OR WHATEVER.
 I BELIEVE DAVID HAS AN IDOL,
EVEN THOUGH HE CLAIMS HE DOES
NOT.
THAT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS, SO I
WANT HIM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.
 DON'T GET PARANOID AND YOU'RE
GOING TO BE OKAY.
 I THINK YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
 MY DECISION IS RACHEL OR
DAVID.
 I JUST THINK IT'S INTERESTING
THEY'RE TALKING TO EVERYONE BUT
ME.
 RACHEL, I THINK SHE'S A
LIABILITY.
THE REASON I WOULD VOTE OUT
DAVID TONIGHT IS BECAUSE I
BELIEVE HE HAS AN IDOL.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
 BUT IF I HAVE SIX PEOPLE, I
HAVE ENOUGH TO FLIP THE VOTE,
AND I THINK WE HAVE MYSELF,
CHRIS, PAUL, SUNDAY, JEFF AND
LUCY.
SO CECE, RACHEL, DAVE AND KEN
WILL BE LEFT OUT OF WHO WE'RE
VOTING FOR.
 SO LET'S SPLIT THE VOTE.
 WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
THINKING ABOUT.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 DEEP DOWN IF PEOPLE THINK I
DROPPED THE BALL AT THE PUZZLE.
 SOMETHING WEIRD IS GOING ON.
DO YOU SEE AN ALLIANCE BEING
FORMED?
 YES.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
THINKING?
 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.
I NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT I'D
FEEL LIKE THIS SO EARLY IN THE
GAME WHERE I FEEL LIKE CECE AND
ME, WE'RE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
 I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO THINK
ABOUT IT.
 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
 BELIEVE IT.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD
SIGN WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "I DON'T
KNOW," SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE I FIT IN AT THIS POINT.
 CHILL OUT.
 I'M AT THE MERCY OF MY TRIBE
MATES.
I'M MY WORST ENEMY IN THIS GAME.
I GOT PARANOID, AND I HOPE THAT
THE SPEECH I GAVE THEM WILL BE
ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FEEL AT EASE
AND TO SAVE ME.
I WORRY THAT IT WON'T.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT WON'T.
BUT I WON'T KNOW UNTIL TRIBAL.
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD, GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH
THE FLAME, DIP IT IN, AND GET
FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SADLY THAT WILL BE THE CASE FOR
ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.
BUT LET'S START AT THE
BEGINNING, BECAUSE THESE FIRST
FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE
ROUGHEST THAT ANY GROUP OF
SURVIVORS HAS EVER HAD TO GO
THROUGH.
JESSICA, EVEN LOOKING AT YOU
EYES RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WELL, WHEN WE HAD TO BE
EVACUATED BECAUSE OF THE
CYCLONE, THE WINDS WERE INSANELY
INTENSE, KICKING UP ALL KINDS OF
SAND, AND I GOT HIT IN MY RIGHT
EYE WITH SOME SAND, AND I NOW
HAVE A BACTERIAL INFECTION IN MY
EYE THAT I HAVE NOW GIVEN TO MY
OTHER EYE.
 Jeff: BRET, EVEN WHEN I WAS
APPROACHING THE BEACH, THE SAM
WAS PELTING ME PRETTY HARD AND
THE STORM HADN'T EVEN HIT YET.
 I GUESS IT'S CLOSE TO A
NOR'EASTER IN BOSTON, BUT I
THINK IT'S TEN TIMES WORSE.
IT WAS INTENSE.
YOU FELT LIKE IT WAS NEVER GOING
TO END.
 Jeff: DAVID.
 OH CRAP.
 Jeff: SORRY, WHAT?
 OH, CRAP.
 Jeff: WHY DO YOU SAY, "OH,
CRAP"?
 BECAUSE HE'S SCARED OF
EVERYTHING.
 Jeff: WOW, DAVID, ALL NINE
OF THEM IN UNISON SAY HE'S
SCARED OF EVERYTHING.
 THIS IS FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN
CAMPING IN OVER 21 YEARS, AND,
YOU KNOW, MY WORLD HAS GOTTEN
SMALLER WHERE I FEEL SAFE, BUT
OUT HERE IN THE ELEMENTS, I'M
STRIPPED BARE, AND IT'S JUST SO
TRANSPARENT.
THESE LAST FUR DAYS IT FEELS
LIKE IT'S A YEAR LONG AND I'M SO
GRATEFUL FOR THIS EXPERIENCE.
 Jeff: THOSE ARE THE WORDS
OF SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE OKAY
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
"I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE."
 I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.
I REALLY DON'T.
BUT I MIGHT BE GOING HOME.
LIKE MY BIGGEST ENEMY IN THIS
GAME, HONESTLY, IS MYSELF.
AND I'M RUNNING INTO THAT RIGHT
NOW.
 Jeff: CECE, CAN YOU FEEL
DAVID'S PAIN?
NOBODY WANTS TO BE VOTED OUT,
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE FIRST
PERSON.
 OF COURSE.
I TOTALLY FEEL HIS PAIN.
LIKE YOUR DREAM IS TO BE ON
"SURVIVOR," AND THERE'S CHANCE
YOU MAY BE GOING HOME.
I WOULDN'T WISH THAT ON ANYONE.
IT'S JUST AWFUL.
 Jeff: SUNDAY IS IT GREAT TO
HEAR SOMEBODY SAYING, YEAH, I
THINK IT MIGHT BE ME?
 ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE I LOVE
DAVID, BUT WE'RE ALL HERE TO
STAY, AND IF YOU FEEL LIKE
ATTENTION IS ON SOMEONE ELSE TO
GO HOME, IT TAKES LESS OFF OF
YOU AND MAYBE THERE'S LESS
CHANCE YOU COULD BE THE ONE
GOING HOME.
 Jeff: OF THE TEN OF YOU,
WHO HERE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS
HAS HAD THE THOUGHT, MAN, IT
MIGHT BE ME?
 I THINK ALL OF US.
 Jeff: CHRIS, IS IT A REAL
FEELING, OR IS IT JUST THAT
PARANOIA OF WHO KNOWS IF THESE
PEOPLE ARE BEING STRAIGHT WITH
ME?
 I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
PARANOIA.
DAY TWO I THOUGHT I WAS ON THE
OUTS.
I LITERALLY THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD,
I'M GOING TO GET VOTED OUT FIRST
AND NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN BACK
HOME EVER.
BUT I JUST KIND OF SAID, YOU
KNOW WHAT, IT'S PROBABLY IN MY
HEAD.
I'LL JUST SHOW THESE PEOPLE I
CAN WORK HARD AND I FEEL A LOT
BETTER TODAY.
 Jeff: RACHEL, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?
TELL ME ABOUT THE MOMENT WHERE
YOU THOUGHT, MIGHT BE IN
TROUBLE?
 REALLY TODAY WHEN EVERYONE
WAS UNDECIDED AND NOT RESPONSIVE
AND PAIRING OFF, IT WAS JUST
REALLY UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR, SO I
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TODAY.
MAYBE PARANOIA OR MAYBE I'M
ACTUALLY GOING HOME.
 Jeff: WHY DO YOU THINK IT
WOULD BE YOU?
 I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN UP
FRONT AND JUST SAY THINGS THAT'S
ON MY MIND.
I SAY WHAT IT IS.
I DON'T MEAN TO BE MEAN OR DO
ANYTHING TO SOMEONE ON PURPOSE,
NOT AT ALL.
WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR ME OR NOT,
IT'S MORE THAN I JUST WANT TO
REPAIR AND AMEND.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE
IF I MADE YOU FEEL A CERTAIN
WAY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT IDOLS.
JESSICA, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
ARE THERE IDOLS IN THE GAME, AND
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY ON THIS
TRIBE MIGHT HAVE ONE?
 I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY
IDOLS IN THIS GAME, AND I THINK
THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PEOPLE THE LOOK FOR IDOLS.
I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY DAVID
GOT SO PARANOID, BECAUSE THAT
WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT
CAME UP ABOUT DAVID.
 Jeff: AGAIN, IT GOES BACK
TO DAVID.
 YEAH, ISN'T IT GREAT?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, I RESPECT THAT
RESPONSE.
YOU KNOW, I WANT THE PROVE
TONIGHT THAT I CAN BE TRUSTED,
AND SO THIS IS A TEST.
 Jeff: WOW.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
PAUL, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
OKAY.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
ALL RIGHT.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DAVID.
RACHEL.
SUNDAY.
CECE.
ONE VOTE CECE, ONE VOTE SUNDAY,
ONE VOTE DAVID, ONE VOTE RACHEL.
RACHEL.
THAT'S TWO VOTES RACHEL.
CECE.
THAT'S TWO VOTES CECE.
RACHEL.
CECE.
WE'RE TIED.
THREE VOTES CECE, THREE VOTES
RACHEL, ONE VOTE SUNDAY, ONE
VOTE DAVID.
RACHEL.
FOUR VOTES RACHEL, THREE VOTES
CECE, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VS.
GEN-X," RACHEL.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
RACHEL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 Jeff: WELL, ONE OF THE
HALLMARKS OF GEN-X, YOU'RE IN
THE AFRAID TO WORK HARD, AND
THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU'VE
WORKED HARD THESE FIRST FEW
DAYS.
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS: HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO RECOVER AGAINST
THOSE MILLENNIALS?
THE GOOD NEWS, FIRE IN THE FORM
OF FLINT WILL BE WAITING FOR
YOU.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THERE'S A ROMANCE
BLOOMING.
 I GOT LOVE GOGGLES.
 SOMETIMES WOMEN BLIND YOU.
LIKE WAKE UP.
 Jeff: WHILE SOMEONE'S TIME
IN THE GAME MIGHT BE CUT SHORT.
 YOU HAVE TO BREATHE.
 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A HEART
ATTACK.
 THIS MIGHT BE A MISTAKE FOR
ME.
 "SURVIVOR" IS ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT AND BRUTAL SOCIAL
GAMES ON THE PLANET, HOWEVER,
I'M HAPPY FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
AND I HOPE TO UTILIZE IT TO GROW
AS A PERSON.
IT'S A LOT HARDER TO SURVIVE THE
CONDITIONS THAN IT PROBABLY
APPEARS ON TV.
BUT FOR MOST OF IT,
I ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF FUN.
