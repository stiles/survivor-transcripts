YOU CAN TELL BY THE ECHO WE'RE
LIVE.
WE'RE IN LOS ANGELES LIVE FOR
THE SEASON FINALE TWO-HOUR SHOW.
COME BACK WITH ME.
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE
GROUP OF PLAYERS OF ALL TIME.
HERE THEY ARE, THE MILLENNIAL
GEN X CAST.
I GOT TO SAY, YOU GUYS HAVE
GIVEN US A GREAT SEASON OF GAME
PLAY.
IT HAS BEEN FUN TO WATCH, AND
THAT GAME PLAY HAS RESULTED IN
SOME DEVASTATING BUT THOROUGHLY
ENTERTAINING BLIND SIDES.
IN FACT, WHERE IS... OH, HERE WE
GO.








ONE OF THE BEST REACTIONS AFTER
A BLIND SIDE, WILL AND JAY GOT
YOU SO GOOD YOU FORGOT YOUR
SHOES.
 I SURE DID.
 JEFF: IT WAS EPIC.
THIS SEASON HAS ALSO HAD SOME
AMAZING STORIES OF GROWTH,
PEOPLE WHO REALLY DID TRANSFORM
FROM FEARFUL TO FEARLESS, AND
THAT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE
THE GUTS TO TAKE ON SOMETHING
LIKE "SURVIVOR."
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
TONIGHT.
WE HAVE THE TWO-HOUR SEASON
FINALE.
IT'S AWESOME.
THEN WE'RE GOING TO READ THE
VOTES.
WE'LL ANNOUNCE THE WINNER.

EVERYBODY BACK FOR THE LIVE
REUNION SHOW.
SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION
TONIGHT, HIT ME UP ON TWITTER.
YACHTAL JEFFPROBST
#"SURVIVOR"FINALE.
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A SNEAK PEEK
AT WHO WILL BE PLAYING NEXT
SEASON.
ALL RIGHT.
CUE THE MUSIC, GLEN.
LET'S GET TO IT.
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
NIGHT ALL SEASON LONG.
THE SURVIVOR FINALE.
YOU'REçó SITTING AT HOME CURLED
IN FRONT OF THE COUCH.
SIX PEOPLE LEFT, THREE
MILLENNIALS, THREE GEN X.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THIS
SEASON ANY OF THEM COULD WIN
BECAUSE THIS GAME IS FAR FROM
OVER, AND WE HAVE A PACKED HOUSE
HERE TO WATCH IT WITH US HERE AT
CBS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THESE
TICKETS ARE STILL IN DEMAND.
THEY ARE READY, AND I KNOW YOU
ARE.
HERE IT IS, THE SEASON FINALE OF
"SURVIVOR"!
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 Jeff: FOR 35 DAYS IT HAS
BEEN A BATTLE BETWEEN CLASHING
CULTURES, MILLENNIALSÑ
X.
 MAY THE BEST GENERATION WIN.
 Jeff: TWO GROUPS WITH VERY
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO LIFE.
 WE'RE YOUNG MILLENNIALS.çó
WE DON'T CARE.
 JUST BUILD THIS DAMN THING.
 Jeff: IT WAS CLEAR THIS WAS
GOING TO BE A SEASON LIKE NO
OTHER.
THEY'VE GOT IT!
WOW.
THERE WAS MOTHER NATURE'S FURY.é
AND RISKY ROMANCE.
THERE WAS RAW EMOTION.
 MY MOM HAS STAGE FOUR LUNG
CANCER.
 Jeff: AND BRIDGES BUILT
BETWEEN GENERATIONS.
 YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GAY GUY
OUTÑi HERE.
 I OWE A LOT TO BRET'S
GENERATION.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE GAME PLAY WAS INTENSE.
 THE VOTE IS STILL VERY MUCH
LIVE.
 HERE YOU GO, JEFF.
THE IDOL IS FOR KEN.
 Jeff: LEADING TO AN EPIC
ROCK DRAW.
REVEAL.
 OH, MY GOD.
JESSICA.Ñi .
 Jeff: AND A STRING OF
DEVASTATING BLIND SIDES.
ONLY SIX REMAIN.
THREE MILLENNIALS AND THREE GEN
X.
ADAM, THIS "SURVIVOR" FAN HAS
WON CHALLENGES, FOUND AN IDOL
AND A REWARD STEAL.
 I'M GIVING YOU THE ADVANTAGE,
DUDE.
 Jeff: THE ONLY THING LEFT
TO DO IS WIN FOR HIS MOM.
 MY MOM TOLD ME, YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TO.
I SET MY MIND TO WINNING THIS
GAME.
I'M GOING TO FINALIZE THAT
DREAM.
 Jeff: JAY, SINCE THE MERGE,
HE'S MANAGED TO AVOID THE VOTE.
NOW, WITHOUT AN IDOL TO PROTECT
HIM, HE'S VULNERABLE.
CAN HE WIN HIS WAY TO THE END,
OR WILL HE FINALLY HAVE HIS
TORCH SNUFFED?
 NO ONE WANTS TO SAY, I GOT TO
THE SIX.
NO, YOU WANT TO BE LIKE, DUDE, I
GOT TO THE THREE.
 Jeff: HAND NARCOTIC EARLY
IN THE GAME SHE SUFFERED A PANIC
ATTACK WHILE MERELY WATCHING A
CHALLENGE.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET ME
DIE?
 Jeff: BUT SHE HAS MATURE
ENTERED A DANGEROUS PLAYER.
IF SHE MAKES IT TO THE END, WILL
HER RESUME BE STRONG ENOUGH TO
CONVINCE THE JURY?
 I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED
OR MORE FOCUSED, EVER IN MY
LIFE.
WAIT, IS MY ARMPIT HAIR OUT?
 Jeff: BRET, THE LIKABLE
BOSTON POLICE SERGEANT.
HIS GAME IS FOCUSED ON
RELATIONSHIPS, AND HE HAS A LOT
OF FRIENDS ON THE JURY.
IF HE CAN SURVIVE THE LAST THREE
VOTES, IT COULD BE WORTH $1
MILLION.
 YOU'RE HUNGRY, THERE'SÑi NO
FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH.
I SWEAR TO GOD I'M DIGESTING MY
SPLEEN RIGHT NOW.
JUST GET ME TO THE FINAL THREE
WHERE I CAN ABSOLUTELY RIP THEM
APART.
 Jeff: KEN, A SINGLE FATHER
PLAYING FOR HIS DAUGHTER, AND
WITH THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE IN HIS
POCKET, HE HAS AT LEAST ONE EDGE
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.
 IF YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF
THIS NOLT ON DAY 36, YOU WILL
RECEIVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
 Jeff: KEN HAS NEVER TRADE
FROM HIS ALLIANCE WITH DAVID,
BUT WILL BEING LOYAL PAY OFF IN
THE END?
 IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST AND IT'S
ALL ABOUT FAITH AND IT'S ALL
ABOUT LOVE, HONESTLY.
 Jeff: DAVID, A
SELF-DESCRIBED FEARFUL, NEUROTIC
ODDBALL HASñr TRANSFORMED INTO A
STRATEGIC POWERHOUSE.
IRONICALLY HIS IMPRESSIVE GAME
PLAY IS NOW HIS BIGGEST
OBSTACLE.
 THERE ARE 14 PEOPLE MISSING
FROM THE GAME, AND I'M NOT ONE
OF THEM.
AND NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK,
WAIT A SECOND, IT'S ACTUALLY
POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT BE A
MILLIONAIRE IN A FEW DAYS.
 Jeff: WHO WILL HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO OUTWIT, OUTPLAY AND
OUTLAST ALL THE REST TO WIN THE
$1 MILLION AND THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR?
 THE PLAN WAS TO WEED OUT THE
IDOL.
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
 I WASN'T GOING TO PLAY IT.
 WHAT CHANGED?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
I REALLY WASN'T.
THEY FLUSHED MY IDOL.
NOW THEY HAVE LEFT ME BARREN AND
NAKED IN THIS FRICKEN JUNGLE,
FIGHTING FOR MYSELF, AND IT
SUCKS.
I MADE A FRICKEN DUMB MOVE.
 YOU GOT BALLS OF STEEL FOR
HOLDING ON TO IT AS LONG AS YOU
DID.
 NOW I HAVE TO GO AROUND THIS
CAMP TOMORROW AND START
SEARCHING FOR THE NEW ONE.
TIME TO FIGHT FOR THE DEATH,
BABY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO CUT
THE THROAT OF A SNAKE, YOU DO
IT.
 FOR ME TONIGHT WAS THE WRONG
TIME.
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS HORRIBLE.
IT WAS OUR CHANCE TO GET DAVE.
WE HAD HIM IN OUR SIGHTS.
HE WAS OBLITERATED.
IT'S LIKE... IT'S LIKE THE NAVY
SEALS GOING INTO OSAMA BIN
LADEN'S HOUSE, WALKING UP, GOT
THE GUNS OUT, THEY GOT HIM IN
THEIR SIGHTEDS AND TxE? SAY, YOU
KNOW WHAT, LET'S GO GRAB SOME
COFFEE.
WE'LL GIVE HIM ANOTHER DAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW.
YOU GOT HIM IN YOUR SIGHTS.
YOU'RE THERE.
YOU TAKE HIM OUT.
BUT DAVID, HE IS DANGEROUS.
 OKAY.
 AND HE SHOULD HAVE GONE
TONIGHT.
 OKAY.
 BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE JAY WE
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.
 THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
MY OPINION IS DIFFERENT.
 I'M WORKING WITH COMPLETE
MORONS.
JAY AND DAVE ARE GOING TO WIN
THIS THING.
WE HAVE TO VOTE THEM OUT.Ñi
 I SOMEHOW ESCAPED ANOTHER
WE HAVE TO VOTE THEM OUT.Ñi
 I SOMEHOW ESCAPED ANOTHER
VOTE, BUT I HAVE A HUGE TARGET
ON MY BACK RIGHT NOW, AND I'M
LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, YOU
KNOW, WHERE ARE THE KNIVES GOING
TO COME FROM, LIKE WHO IS COMING
AFTER ME?
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO
SURVIVE, SO I NEED TO CREATE A
LITTLE CHAOS.çó
I HAVE BEEN STEALING ALL OF
THESE BEADS AND SHELLS FOR A
WHILE NOW.
I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM OFF OF
TRIBAL TORCHES.
I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM OFF OF
WATER BOTTLES.
I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM OFF OF
TREE MAIL.
I WANTED TO HAVE A LOT OF
OPTIONS.
WE'RE GETTING TOWARD THE END.
I'M ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE NO
IDOLS LEFT IN THIS GAME, BUT A
FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL COULD REALLY
MESSED UP SOMEONE'S GAME.
WE ARE BARRELING TOWARD THE END
OF THIS GAME, AND I'VE GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE
THAT I END UP IN THE FINAL
THREE.
IF I HAVE TO DO DIRTY TRICKS
LIKE THIS, THEN SO BE IT, AND
HOPEFULLY BY TOMORROW MORNING
I'LL HAVE CAUGHT A FISH.
HOPEFULLY BY TOMORROW MORNING
I'LL HAVE CAUGHT A FISH.
 I NEED TO FIND THIS FRICKEN
IDOL, MAN.
I NEED A DELIVERY FROM AN ANGEL
TO SWING BY AND, BOOP, HERE YOU
GO.
THEN I HEAR, "JAY, JAY."
THEN I'M LIKE, I NEED TO GET
SOME COCONUTS OR THIS WILL LOOK
REALLY SUSPICIOUS.
 YOU GOT SOMETHING?
 COCONUT, COCONUT, COCONUT.
 IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE
THINGS.
 I HAVE KEN AND DAVID BEHIND
ME TALKING WHATEVER NONSENSE.
ALL I'M DOING IS FOCUSING.
I'M LOOKING, I'M LOOKING, I'M
LOOKING, E-MAIL LOOKING AND,
BOOP, I SEE A PINK IT LITTLE CIR
THAT WAS ON A LITTLE COCONUT.
OH, MY GOD, DUDE.
OH, MY GOD.
I THINK HE MAY HAVE SEEN IT.
IF I'M RIGHT I CAUGHT THE FISH
THAT I WANTED TO CATCH.
LUCKILY THESE TWO FOOLS DIDN'T
LOOK DOWN AND THEY JUST KEPT
TALKING ABOUT COCONUTS WHILE
YOUR BOY JAY'S GOT HIS EYES ON
THE PRIZE, WHICH IS THE GOLDEN
COCONUT.
 OH, BOY.
 TAKE ME OUT OF THE GAME,
BITCHES.
THANK YOU.
BASTARDS.
LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THEY MADE ME FLUSH MY IDOL, MY
SAFETY NET.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
WHOOPSIE, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
NO ONE SAW THE FRICKEN IDOL.
I HAVE A TRAIN OF LOSERS
FOLLOWING ME INTO THE CAMP.
HOW STUPID THEY DIDN'T SEE IT.
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE PIRATE OUT OF
THIS GAME.
LET'S FRICKEN DO THIS.
I'M GOING FOR A MILLION BUCKS.
 I'M TIRED.
I'M HUNGRY.
BUT DAY 36 IS A DAMN GOOD DAY IN
MY WORLD.
TODAY I GET TO OPEN UP THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE AND SEE WHAT IT
HAS IN STORE FOR ME.
THIS IS FOR YOU, KIDDO.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU ARE THE BENEFICIARY OF THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
THIS NOTE GUARANTEES YOU
IMMUNITY AT THE NEXT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THIS GAME IS UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT
NOW, AND YOU NEVER FEEL SAFE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SIX
PEOPLE LEFT.
THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE GUARANTEES
ME ANOTHER STEP IN THIS GAME.
THIS IS BIG, BEYOND BIG, AND I
HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT.
SO NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW ABOUT
THIS UNTIL TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 I'M IN.
 Jeff: KEN, I GOT TO TAKE IT
BACK.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE THROUGH A SERIES
OF OBSTACLES WHILE COLLECTING A
BAG OF TILES.
YOU'LL USE THE NUMBERS INSIDE TO
SOLVE A COMBINATION LOCK.
THAT WILL RELEASE A KEY.
YOU'LL COVER YOUR NUMBERS, GO
UNDER A NET, UP A WALL, AND USE
THE KEY TO UNLOCK A SET OF
PUZZLE PIECES.
YOU'LL THEN RACE TO ASSEMBLE A
PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A ONE IN FIVE SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IN ADDITION, THE FIRST TO FINISH
WINS REWARD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH.
 Jeff: WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: THE FIRST TO FINISH
WILL GET A BIG, JUICY STEAK
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP
WITH ALL THE FIXINGS.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO DRAW
FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMONEYTY AND REWARD --
IMMUNITY AND REWARD, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO!
ATTACK THAT WALL.
KEN AND JAY OVER FIRST.
THEN BRET, HANNAH, DAVID AND
36 DAYS.
WHATEVER'S IN THE TANK, YOU NEED
IT NOW.
JAY HAS HIS BAG OF TILES.
HE'S THROUGH FIRST.
KEN RIGHT BEHIND.
IT IS JAY AND KEN.
HERE GOES HANNAH NOW.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO UNTIE THE
TILES AND USE THE THREE PAIRS OF
NUMBERS TO SOLVE THE COMBINATION
LOCK.
EVERYBODY NOW WORKING ON THOSE
TILES.
THERE ARE SIX POSSIBLE
COMBINATIONS.
 COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: JAY HAS HIS TILES OUT
OF THE BAG.
HE'S GOT THEM UNKNOTTED.
JAY CAN START WORKING.
KEN IS TRYING TO UNTIE HIS
TIELTS.
DAVID HAS HIS OUT.
HE'S UNTYING THEM.
JAY TRIES ONE COMBO.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
JAY GOING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER GO
AND HE'S GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME.
RELEASES HIS KEY.
JAY IN THE LEAD NOW.
BUT HE DID NOT COVER IT UP.
DAVID TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IT.
KEN'S GOT IT FIGURED OUT.
EVERYBODY IS NOW LOOKING.
IT IS CHAOS.
BIG ERROR BY JAY.
HE'S GOT A COVER HE COULD HAVE
USED AND HE DIDN'T.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE TO CATCH UP.
IT IS JAY RACING TO THE TOP.
START WORKING ON HIS PUZZLE.
KEN RIGHT BEHIND.
DAVID NOW GOING TO USE THE
NUMBERS TO RELEASE THE KEY.
AND IT'S IN THE RIGHT.
HE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT.
THERE GOES BRET.
DAVID COMING BACK FOR ANOTHER
LOOK.
HERE GOES HANNAH NOW.
SO FATIGUED THAT EVEN WHEN HE
CAN READ THE NUMBERS, IT IS HARD
TO SOLVE IT.
DAVID GOES BACK FOR A THIRD
LOOK.
SIMPLE MEMORY NOW IS PROVING
DIFFICULT.
DAVID HAS HIS KEY.
IT IS NOW ADAM IN DEAD LAST.
HE'S GOT HIS KEY.
YOU'VE GOT TO ATTACK THIS LAST
WALL.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
EVERYBODY WORKING ON THAT
PUZZLE.
 COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: JAY HAD A BIG LEAD
AND HE GAVE IT ALL UP BY NOT
COVERING THAT COMBINATION.
WILL IT COME BACK THE HAUNT HIM
BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY IS WORKING
ON THEIR PUZZLE.
 COME ON.
 Jeff: HANNAH TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW THESE TWO FIRST
PIECES HANG TOGETHER.
IT IS JAY IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW.
EVERYBODY ELSE TRYING THE CATCH
HIM.
NOW IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO
HOW MUCH OF THAT DIMINISHED
BRAIN CAPACITY CAN YOU MUSTER
RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A
VERY COMPLICATED PUZZLE.
 DAMMIT.
DAMMIT.
DAMMIT.
DAMMIT.
 Jeff: JAY WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.
HANNAH LOOKING NEXT DOOR FOR
SOME KIND OF CLUE.
DAVID IS BACK IN THIS.
AND OPENING THE DOOR, JAY LET
FIVE OTHER PEOPLE CATCH HIM.
IT COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC, $1
MILLION MISTAKE.
 YOU HAD THE LEAD, YOU BOZO.
 Jeff: BRET NOW MAKING SOME
PROGRESS.
DAVID WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
ADAM NOW LOOKING AT DAVID'S
PUZZLE TRYING TO GET SOME HELP.
BRET NOW LOOKING AT DAVID.
DAVID WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
 GET IN THERE.
 Jeff: JAY TRYING TO GET
BACK IN THIS NOW.
HE'S HAD A BIG LEAD.
DAVID HAS CAUGHT HIM.çó
DAVID AND JAY BATTLING FOR
IMMUNITY.
WHO WILL GET THERE FIRST?
 THERE IT IS.
 Jeff: DAVID WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.
JAY GETTING CLOSER.
BUT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.
 JEFF!
 Jeff: DAVID DOWN TO HIS
LAST PIECE.
JAY ALMOST THERE.
JAY LOSES EVERYTHING.
 JEFF!
 Jeff: DAVID THINKS HE HAS
IT.
DAVID WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
AND REWARD IN THE FORM OF A
STEAK DINNER.
 THANKS, MAN.
THANK YOU.
 SO CLOSE!
 Jeff: DAVID, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, DAVE.
 Jeff: THANKS, GUYS.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
DAVID, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, GUARANTEED A 1-5 SHOT
AT WINNING THIS GAME.
IN ADDITION, YOU'VE JUSTÑi EARNE
A GIANT STEAK REWARD BACK AT
CAMP.
HERE'S YOUR DILEMMA.
YOU CAN CHOOSE TWO OF THE
REMAINING FIVE TO JOIN YOU,
WHICH MEANS...
 JEFF.
 Jeff: JAY.
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE FOUND
AN ADVANTAGE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
STEAL AN AWARD AFTER IT HASÑi BE
WON BY SOMEONE ELSE.
 Jeff: SO, JAY, THAT MEANS
YOU ARE TAKING OVER THE REWARD?
 YEAH.
BUT I'M GOING TO EAT WITH DAVID.
HE WON.
HE BEAT ME.
BUT I'M PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE.
 Jeff: SO YOU COME OVER
HERE.
 THANKS, JAY.
 Jeff:
 I DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOW IN
CHARGE OF THE REWARD.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CHOOSE?
 THE PERSON WHO GAVE ME THIS
BECAUSE HE WON IT FAIRLY.
 WOW.
 Jeff: BIG POLITICAL
DECISION.
DAVID, JAY, ADAM, BIG STEAK
DINNER WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP.
HANNAH, KEN AND BRET, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON, CONGRATS.
 THANKS A LOT.
 I FRICKING BLEW IT.
I WAS SO CLOSE TO MAKING FINAL
FOUR FOR SURE.
NOW I HAVE TO TAKE ADAM AND
DAVID AND SIT THEM DOWN AND SAVE
MYSELF.
THE GAME IS NOT OVER UNTIL THEY
SAY THE GAME IS OVER.
 WOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
 LOOK AT THAT.
 WOW.
 SIT DOWN, BOYS.
LET'S EAT.
 YEAH, YEAH, I LOVE IT.
LET'S HAVE A TOAST.
 THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME
HERE.
 THANK YOU BOTH.
 OH, MY GOD.
 TONIGHT I'M GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THE REWARDS ARE IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IF YOU PICK THE PEOPLE
CORRECTLY, YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR
FATE.
YOU CAN MAKE MOVES.
IF THERE IS WAY THE SWAY DAVID
AND ADAM TO VOTE BRET, I CAN
SAVE MY IDOL TONIGHT SO THAT
TOMORROW I CAN SIT BACK, RELAX
AND JUST GO, BOOP, I DON'T NEED
TO DO ANYTHING.
 CONSIDERING, DAVID, YOU ARE
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN A LOT OF
PEOPLE'S EYES, I AM ALSO A HUGE
THREAT, AND IF YOU GET RID OF
BOTH ME AND YOU, ADAM, YOU'RE UP
NEXT.
 I'M THE PERFECT SHIELD THE
TAKE.
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ME OUT
BEFORE THEY TAKE EITHER OF YOU
OUT.
 WHAT IF YOU KEEP WINNING?
 IF I KEEP WINNING, WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
I'LL TAKE YOU BOTH?
BECAUSE I'LL DO IT.
 I WILL TAKE YOU BOTH, AND IF
BRET WINS TOMORROW, I GUARANTEE
THAT HE'S NOT TAKING YOU TWO.
 WELL, HE HATES ME.
 HE TOLD ME THAT HE WANTS YOU
OUT, AND, BRET, HE'S GOT EVERY
FRIEND ON THAT JURY.
 OH, HE DOES, HE DOES.
OTHER THAN KEN, NOT A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING UP TO ME AND
TELLING ME THEY WANT TO TAKEñr M
TO FINAL THREE.
JAY IS NOT ONLY OFFERING FINAL
THREE, BUT ALSO SERVES AS A
SHIELD FOR MYSELF.
THAT'S INCREDIBLY TEMPTING,
BECAUSE ONCE JAY IS GONE,
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE LOOKING
AT ME.
 THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME HERE,
AND IT DID NOT FALL ON DEAF
EARS.
 SO IT SHOULD BE PRETTY SIMPLE
TONIGHT THEN.
 ESPECIALLY JAY ON A FULL
BELLY OF PROTEIN AND FOOD.
 OH, YEAH, WE'RE SCREWED.
HE'S GOT TO GO TONIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, JUST WRITE
HIS NAME DOWN.
 YOU CAN'T EVER LET YOUR GUARD
DOWN.
I HAVE TO WONDER WAS JAY ABLE TO
SWING ANYBODY TO HIS SIDE.
 THEY WOULD BE A FOOL TO KEEP
HIM IN THE GAME.
 IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE HAS AN
IDOL.
 YOU HAVE TO STOP THINKING
LIKE THAT.
JAY IS GOING HOME, EASY, EASY,
EASY 5-1 VOTE.
 WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOU.
 SO THIS WAS JAY'S LAST SUPPER
ON THE BEACH.
MY CHANCES TO GET TO THE FINAL
THREE ARE LOOKING BETTER AND
BETTER EVERY DAY.
 I'D BE HAPPY TO WRITE DOWN
BRET.
HE ALREADY WANTS ME OUT OF THE
FRICKING GAME LIKE HARD CORE.
 PLUS HE HAS FRIENDS AND HE
HASN'T KILLED ANYONE.
 BRET IS DEFINITELY A THREAT,
BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
FINALLY TAKE OUT JAY.
HE COULD VERY WELL WIN TWO MORE
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGES
AND END UP IN THE FINAL THREE
AND WIN THIS GAME.
 WE NEED TO GO DOWN TO THE
FINAL FOUR BY LEAVING BRET, WHO
HAS NEVER WON A CHALLENGE, AND
PROBABLY CAN'T TO SAVE HIS LIFE,
IN THE GAME WITH THE FINAL FIVE.
 WELL, I TELL YOU THIS, HE
WILL WIN AT THREE.
HE'S THE MOST LIKABLE GUY IN
THIS GAME.
 THAT'S TRUE.
THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE.
THAT'S FAIR.
BRET IS AS MUCH A THREAT AS
ANYONE ELSE.
 IT'S JAY.
JAY HAS TO GO TONIGHT.
 YOU HAVE AN IDOL?
 I WISH I DID.
 I'D PLAY IT RIGHT NOW, BUDDY.
TRUST ME, IF I HAD IT...
 WHAT WAS YOUR PITCH?
 THAT YOU WERE A BIGGER
THREAT.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
 IT SHOULD BE SIMPLE.
BUT YOU'RE DEALING WITH CRAZY
PEOPLE.
 CAN DAVID AND I TALK TO YOU
REAL QUICK?
 WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY WANT
THE TALK TO HIM ABOUT?
THIS IS WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.
THE CRAZIES COULD SEND ME HOME
AND COST ME AND THEMSELVES $1
MILLION.
DOPES.
 SO WE JUST WANTED TO COME TO
YOU AND SAY WHERE WE'RE AT.
DAVID IS DOWN.
 DAVID, THANK YOU.
 I'M A CONSISTENT MAYBE RIGHT
NOW.
BUT ADAM IS LIKE NO.
 YES, MAYBE, NO?
 YEAH.
 IF ADAM WAS ON BOARD, WOULD
YOU BE ON BOARD?
 I'LL TALK TO ADAM.
I NEED THE TALK TO ADAM.
HANNAH AND DAVID ARE WILLING TO
MOVE FORWARD, BUT I NEED TO GET
ADAM ON BOARD.
YOU GOT TO BE PERSISTENT.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IMPLANTING
THINGS IN PEOPLE'S HEADS.
BUT EVEN IF THESE FOOLS DON'T
WANT TO FLIP, I HAVE MY IDOL AND
I CAN TAKE OUT WHOEVER I WANT.
 IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE ME ONE
FRICKING CHANCE, MAN, ONE SHOT,
AND TAKE ME OUT TOMORROW.
EVEN IF I WIN TOMORROW, AND THEN
I WIN THE FOUR, I'M TAKING YOU.
 I KNOW YOU ARE.
 IT'S A GUARANTEE.
DAVID'S IN.
I FLIPPED DAVID.
COME ON, ADAM.
 WE'RE BROTHERS.
FOR LIFE.
 YOU'LL GIVE ME A SHOT?
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT.
 TONIGHT IS A VERY TOUGH
DECISION.
I COULD SAVE JAY.
WE SHARE THIS WEIRD RELATIONSHIP
WHERE WE'RE BITTER RIVALS, BUT
WE ALSO HAVE GROWN INTO THIS
BROTHERLY LOVE, AND I GENUINELY
BELIEVE THAT JAY WANTS TO TAKE
ME TO THE END.
HE'S PROMISED ME FINAL THREE.
THE QUESTION IS: COULD I BEAT
HIM?
THE QUESTION IS: COULD I BEAT
HIM?
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS,
JESSICA, ZEKE, WILL, AND SUNDAY
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
DAVID, YOU WIN IMMUNITY AND
REWARD.
THEN JAY SAYS, I'M GOING TO
STEAL IT.
WALK ME THROUGH THAT, JAY.
 I'VE BEEN ON THE BOTTOM FOR
WEEKS, SO CONSIDERING THAT, I
SAID MY PITCH TO THE BOYS AND I
TRIED TO SCRAMBLE MY WAY OUT OF
THIS ONE.
 Jeff: SO ADAM, WAS LUNCH A
WORKING LUNCH, AS WELL?
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
JAY IS NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP,
AND A REWARD IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND SAY,
WHAT IF THE THREE OF US WORK
TOGETHER.
 Jeff: BRET, YOU HAD TO KNOW
THAT WAS COMING.
 YEAH, I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT,
BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT HIM GOING,
IT'S ME.
SO I WAS HOPING THEY WEREN'T
BUYING WHATEVER HE WAS SELLING,
AND I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER IN THE
PAST, BUT HE IS A THREAT.
 BUT HONESTLY, JEFF, THOSE ARE
ALL OF BRETS FRIENDS.
 HE SEES SOME OF MY FRIENDS.
I SEE A LOT OF HIS FRIEND, AS
WELL.
 I WISH.
 Jeff: HANNAH, IT'S TRICKY,
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE WRONG
PEOPLE TO THE END, YOU COULD BE
GIVING AWAY $1 MILLION.
 YEAH, YOU COULD END UP HAVING
NO CHANCE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
READ THE JURY RIGHT.
SO THERE'S A LOT AT PLAY.
 Jeff: JAY, THE OTHER BIG
MOMENT AT THE CHALLENGE, IT IS
DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU A COVER TO
HIDE THE COMBINATION.
 ALL I HAD TO DO WAS JUST LIFT
THE COVER AND I WOULD BE SITTING
HERE LOOKING LIKE A CHAMPION,
BUT NOW I'M SITTING HERE IN
SWEATS AS USUAL.
 THE THING IS DAY SIX YOU
REMEMBER TO GRAB THAT COVER AND
PULL IT OVER.
DAY 36 IT'S A LOT MORE
DIFFICULT.
 Jeff: DAVID, KEN BRICKS UP
AN INTERESTING POINT.
YOU GUYS HAD A PRETTY DECENT
MEAL.
TOMORROW THERE COULD BE ANOTHER
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, AND, MAN,
WHEN YOU ARE CLEAR HEADED,
THAT'S A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.
 YES, ABSOLUTELY.
I FEEL LIKE I COULD BEAT YOU IN
AN ARM WRESTLING MATCH RIGHT
NOW.
 MY MONEY IS ON JEFF.
 Jeff: KEN, HOW MUCH TALK IS
THERE OF IDOLS AND WHETHER THERE
ARE ANY STILL IN THE GAME AND IF
SO WILL THEY GET PLAYED?
 ANYTHING IN THIS GAME IS
POSSIBLE, BUT THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT IS IF
YOU SNEAK AWAY WITHOUT ANYBODY
KNOWING.
SOMEONE GETS UP AND STIRS IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, YOU'RE
HEARING IT.
 Jeff: HAND NARCOTIC WHAT'S
YOUR TAKE ON TONIGHT'S VOTE.
 WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE SITTING UP
HERE, SO EVERY VOTE IS A HUGE
DECISION.
EVERY VOTE HAS A PURPOSE.
WHETHER OR NOT THAT PURPOSE IS
CLEAR RIGHT AWAY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
BRET, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
JEFF?
I'M NOT GOING HOME.
 OH, MY GOD.
 YOU GUYS CAN CHASE ME, BUT
YOU GOT TO BE QUICKER THAN THAT.
 WOW.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 WOW.
 Jeff: THIS IS... NOT A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
IT IS A WORK OF ART, BUT IT HAS
NO VALUE IN THIS GAME.
 OH, MY GOD.
DUDE, YOU FREAKING GOT ME, YOU
BASTARDS.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JAY WILL
COUNT.
 JEFF, CAN I GIVE SOMETHING TO
YOU?
 Jeff: YES.
 THANK YOU.
 WHAT?
 NO WAY.
 THIS IS CALLED THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
IF DAY 36 HITS AND YOU HAVE THIS
IN YOUR POCKET, IT COUNTS AS AN
AUTOMATIC INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 WHOA.
 Jeff: THIS IS A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR KEN TONIGHT
WILL NOT COUNT.
 WHAT?
 WOW.
 Jeff: I'LL READ THE VOTES.
 I HATE THIS GAME.
 Jeff: FIRST VOTE, KEN.
WILL NOT COUNT.
JAY.
THAT'S ONE VOTE JAY.
JAY.
TWO VOTES JAY.
15th PERSON VOTED OUT,
EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY --
 DAMN.
YOU GOT ME.
I HATE ALL OF YOU.
 TO THE VERY END, DUDE.
TO THE VERY END.
 I HAD FUN, THOUGH.
 Jeff: JAY.
 YOU'RE ALL WARRIORS.
IT WAS MAD FUN.
 YOU, TOO JAY.
 BYE.
 Jeff: GO AHEAD, JEFFREY.Ñi
SNAP MY DOOR SHUT.
 Jeff: JAY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 WELL DONE.
 SEE YOU, BUD.
 $1 MILLION LOCK COMBINATION.
 THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
 Jeff: AND NOW WE'RE DOWN
THE FIVE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 OH, MAN.
YOU GOT ME.
YOU GOT ME.
THAT SUCKS TO GO OUT.
OH, I TRIED MY BEST, BEGGING,
PLEADING, FIGHTING, SCRAMBLING.
I HAD A LOT OF FUN.
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
MUCH LOVE FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELL, I KNOW THERE
WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HATED
TO SEE JAY GO, BUT THAT REALLY
CAPTURES THE LEVEL OF GAME PLAY
THAT WE'VE SEEN ALL SEASON.
DAVID AND JAY BOTH PLAYING
AGGRESSIVELY.
SOMETIMES IT WORKS.
SOMETIMES YOU GET BURNED.
BUT TO GET FAR IN "SURVIVOR,"
YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING THE TAKE
THE RISK.
IT'S ALSO A BIT OF A TEASE FOR
WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT SEASON.
"SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VS. GEN
X" CONTINUES AFTER THIS.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 I AM EXTRAORDINARILY WORRIED
THAT JAY IS GONE BECAUSE HE WAS
MY SHIELD.
I THINK NOW I'M THE BIGGEST
TARGET.
 THAT'S INTENSE.
 SO I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO
BE VOTED OUT NEXT IF I DO NOT
WIN TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
I JUST WISH IT WASN'T A SWIMMING
CHALLENGE.
 Jeff: GUYS READY TO GET TO
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
DAVID.
I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK.
 WHY DID HAVE IT TO BE WATER,
JEFF?
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO MANEUVER A BUOY THROUGH
A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.
YOU'LL THEN USE TWO HANDLES TO
TRANSPORT PUZZLE PIECES ACROSS A
TEETER TOTTER.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE PIECES,
YOU'LL USE THEM TO SOLVE A WORD
PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
LOSERS GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL JOIN THE
JURY.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.

 Jeff: GO!

BEACH.
BRET IS NOW THROUGH.

HERE COMES HANNAH.
SHE'S STILL FIGHTING TO STAY IN
IT.
KEN HEADING OVER THE TEETER
TOTTER.
KEN TAKES A LOT OF TILES AT ONCE
AND DROPS THEM ALL.
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS
CHALLENGING.
NOW HOW MANY CAN YOU TAKE AT
ONCE.
BRET NOW GOING TO HEAD OVER WITH
JUST A FEW.
BRET DOING A NICE JOB.
BRET IS UP.
BRET HAS HIS FIRST TILE.
BRET NOW IN THE LEAD.
KEN GOING TO GIVE IT A GO AGAIN.
THIS TIME WITH MUCH FEWER TILES.
STRUGGLING TO HOLD ON.
HE CAN'T DO IT.
KEN DROPS AGAIN.
KEN'S GOT TO GO BACK.
BRET NOW TAKING ANOTHER SMALL
GROUP OF TILES.
ADAM NOW ON THE BEAM.
BRET'S GOOD.
DAVID NOW ON THE TEETER TOTTER.
DAVID A NICE SAVE.
ADAM, YOU'RE GOOD.

HANNAH'S NOW ON THE TEETER
TOTTER.çó
HANNAH DROPS.
GOT TO GO BACK.
HERE COMES KEN.
KEN NOW STARTING TO GET SOME
MOMENTUM.

HERE COMES KEN WITH HIS LAST
TILES.
KEN, START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
ADAM, YOU'RE GOOD.
DAVID, YOU'RE GOOD.
EVERYBODY IS NOW WORKING ON THE
WORD PUZZLE EXCEPT HANNAH.
 OH, GOD.
 Jeff: LIKE ANY GOOD
"SURVIVOR" PUZZLE, THERE ARE
SEVERAL WORDS THAT WILL WORK,
BUT ONLY ONE PHRASE THAT IS
RIGHT.
YOU MUST HAVE IMMUNITY TONIGHT
TO FEEL SAFE.
HANNAH COMING BACK OVER WITH HER
LAST TILES.
HANNAH NOW WORKING ON THE WORD
PUZZLE.
WHO WILL BE SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL?
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH A WORD
PUZZLE.
LY NOT TELL YOU IF ANYBODY IS
MAKING PROGRESS.
YOU WILL NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE
AHEAD OAR BEHIND.
YOU WILL ONLY KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE
IT.
WHAT IS IT?
PEOPLE NEW STARTING TO MOVE
PIECES AROUND.
 JEFF, JEFF, JEFF.
 Jeff: KEN THINKS HE HAS IT.
SAY IT.
 NOT A PARTICIPATION TROPHY.
 Jeff: IT IS DEFINITELY NOT
A PARTICIPATION TROPHY.
KEN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
 MY GOD, HOW DID I MISS THAT.
 IT WAS SO EASY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DIDN'T GET
THAT.
 Jeff: KEN, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, KEN.
 THANKS, GUYS.
 Jeff: THIRD INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff:Ñi ONCE AGAIN KEN SAFE
FROM THE VOTE, WILL LIVE TO SEE
DAY 38, MAKE IT TO THE FINAL
FOUR.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, I KNOWÑi
IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH 37 DAYS.
HIGH LEVEL OF GAME PLAY FOR ONE
OF YOU.
THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS.Ñi
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 I AM VERY NERVOUS THAT IT
COULD BE ME TONIGHT, BUT I'M
EXTREMELY HAPPY BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT DAVE TO WIN, AND I'M HOPING
DAVE GOES HOME, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GET AHEAD OF MYSELF, BECAUSE
THERE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN THIS VOTE.
ANY TIME YOU GET CRAZIES
INVOLVED, ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.
 NICE JOB, KEN, MAN.
I WANTED THAT ONE, I'M NOT GOING
TO LIE.
 I KNOW.
WE ALL DID.
 YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
I'M USUALLY A VERY HUMBLE
WINNER.
 NO, THAT'S A BIG ONE.
 NEW YORK I WOULD HAVE
SCREAMED, TOO.
 I WAS THIS CLOSE TO HAVING A
GUARANTEED TICKET TO THE FINAL
FOUR, AND I DROPPED THE BALL.
BUT THE FACT THAT DAVE DIDN'T
WIN IS HUGE FOR MY GAME, BECAUSE
I NEED DAVE TO GO HOME TONIGHT.
MORE IMPORTANT THAN STRATEGIZING
WITH PEOPLE THIS AFTERNOON IS
MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE IS AN
IDOL OUT HERE, IT DOESN'T END UP
IN DAVE'S POCKET.
I KNOW THAT BRET IS ON MY SIDE,
AND I KNOW THAT HANNAH IS ON MY
SIDE, BUT AN IDOL CAN SCREW
EVERYTHING UP.
DAVE IS AN INCREDIBLE GUY.
BUT IT'S WHY HE NEEDS TO GO,
BECAUSE HE WOULD WIN THIS GAME.
I'M TERRIFIED THAT IF THIS THING
ISN'T OUT THERE, IT PROBABLY
MEANS THAT DAVE ALREADY HAS IT.
 WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
 BRET'S SITTING OVER THERE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ADAM'S
AT.
 CAN I PITCH SOMETHING TO YOU
GUYS?
 YEAH.
 HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT
VOTING OUT ADAM?
 WOW.
THAT'S A NEW NAME.
WHAT'S THE PITCH AGAINST ADAM
VERSUS BRET?
 WELL, BRET'S GOT TO GO, TWO,
BUT WE'RE FINAL THREE, RIGHT?
 YEAH.
SO THEY BOTH HAVE TO GO, SO IN A
WAY THE ORDER DOESN'T MATTER.
ADAM HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF
WINNING IMMUNITY TOMORROW, AND
HE'SÑi PROBABLY TARGETING ME ANY
HOW.
SO UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE THINKING
ABOUT VOTING OUT ME.
 I'M NOT.
IF THIS IS THE THREE, LET'S JUST
DO IT.
 TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS
ABSOLUTELY A BATTLE BETWEEN ME
AND ADAM.
I NEED TO GET RID OF HIM BEFORE
HE GETS RID OF ME.
IT'S THE LAST NIGHT THAT ANYBODY
CAN PLAY AN IDOL SHOULD THEY
HAVE ONE.
I JUST HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT
WHETHER ONE EVEN EXISTS, SO FOR
THIS VOTE, IT HAS TO BE ADAM.
 WHERE IS ADAM?
 HE SAID HE WAS HAVING STOMACH
ISSUES.
 OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, GOD.
HOW ABOUT TWO IDOLS FOR YOU,
MOM.
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
FINDING ONE AND KNOWING HOW
PROUD MY MOM WAS GOING TO BE OFÑ
THAT WAS SUCH A FEELING OF JOY
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD FOR SEVEN
MONTHS OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME
SINCE MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED.
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE,
SO TO HAVE SOME FEELING OF JOY
HERE AND TO KNOW THAT MY MOM IS
GOING TO SHARE THAT AND GET TO
DO IT TWICE, THAT'S THE BEST.
YOU CAN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING
BETTERÑi THAN THAT.
 FINAL FOUR.
 HOW YOU FEELING, bRáUñ
 I'M NOT FEELING GOOD.
 WELL, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO
WRITE DOWN ADAM'S NAME?
 I'D BE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
THAT WOULD KEEP ME TO THE FINAL
FOUR.
 OKAY.
 DOES THAT HELPoi
 IT DOES HELP.
IT HELPS A LOT.
 I'M IN.
 I KNOW EVERYBODY WANTS ME
OUT, BUT IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE.
 OKAY.
 I COME BACK THINKING I'M NEXT
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, BUT MY
NAME IS NOT EVEN IN THIS AND
TOMORROW IS FINAL FOUR.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S ADAM AND DAVE, THESE TWO
ARE IN A FIGHT AGAINST EACH
OTHER.
SO I'M LETTING DAVE THINK I'M
WITH HIM AND I'M VOTING ADAM.
I'M PLAYING IT COOL.
BUT TONIGHT'S VOTE IS ABOUT
TAKING OUT THE BIGGEST THREAT OF
THE GAME, WHO IS DAVE.
 IS HANNAH ON THEIR SIDE OR IS
SHE WITH US?
 SHE'S WITH US.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER?
 WHOSE IS THAT?
 MINE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.
 I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND THIS
IDOL AT A BETTER MOMENT.
BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN I NEED IT.
DAVE AND KEN DECIDED TO GUN FOR
ME AT THE EXACT MOMENT WHERE I
GOT SAFETY FOR MYSELF.
SO IF ANYTHING THEY'RE GOING TO
LOOK STUPID.
I HAVE TOTAL POWER OVER
TONIGHT'S VOTE.
 ANYTHING NEW?
 YOU KNOW HE'S COMING AFTER
YOU.
 YEAH, NOT BRET, RIGHT?
 NO.
 BUT ACTUALLY ME?
 YOU.
 THE BEST REVENGE, I'LL CANCEL
MY VOTES AND YOU'LL WIN.
 DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL?
 I FOUND IT.
 DUDE, I LOVE YOU.
AND THIS GUY YOU'LL GET THE USE
IT CORRECTLY.
 BASICALLY I'VE BEEN PLAYING
BOTH SIDES LIKE I DO.
ADAM BRAGS TO ME, HE GOES, I
HAVE AN IDOL.
VOTE OUT DAVID.
THERE'S SOME SORT OF ARROGANCE
THAT LINES SOME OF THESE BOYS TO
NOT SEEING WHAT I CAN DO TO
THEM.
THE MEN DON'T HAVE THE POWER AT
THIS TRIBAL.
 OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED.
 BEING IN THE MIDDLE IS WHERE
THE POWER LIES.
I COULD VOTE DAVID OUT OF THE
GAME TONIGHT.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET THE GUY
WHO CAN BEAT US ALL IN THE END
OUT OF THIS GAME.
 RIGHT.
 I COULD GO TO DAVID AND TELL
HIM WE HAVE TO SWITCH THE VOTE
TO BRET.
CAN I ASK A DUMB QUESTION?
 IS THERE MORE A RISK ADAM HAS
AN IDOL?
 I DON'T THINK THERE IS AN
IDOL.
 MY CHOICE TONIGHT IS ABOUT
BOTH WHO I THINK I CAN BEAT AT
THE END AND WHO I CAN TRUST TO
GET ME TO THE END.
 I CAN'T WAIT FOR TONIGHT.
 ALL THE BOYS HAVE OPINION,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I
WANT A LADY TO MAKE THE CHOICE.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS,
JESSICA, ZEKE, WILL, SUNDAY, AND
JAY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT CHALLENGE.
KEN, YOU PULL OUT YOUR THIRD
INDIVIDUAL WIN.
YOU GO BACK TO CAMP.
HANNAH, HOW LONG BEFORE PEOPLE
SCURRY INTO THE JUNGLE.
 NOT VERY LONG, BECAUSE PEOPLE
BOTH WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS
AND PEOPLE WANT THE LOOK FOR
IDOLS SOME THE PLAYING IS NOT
STOPPING WITH THIS GROUP OF
PEOPLE.
 Jeff: ADAM, ARE YOU PART OF
THE IDOL HUNT?
 I THINK I WAS THE FIRST
PERSON TO TAKE OFF, YEAH.
 Jeff: DAVID, WE OFTEN TALK
ABOUT "SURVIVOR" IS THIS
MARATHON OF SPRINTS.
WHERE ARE WE IN THE GAME RIGHT
NOW?
 YEAH, I THINK EACH OF US HAS
BEEN IMAGINING DIFFERENT FINAL
THREES.
WHO ARE THE TWO BEST PEOPLE THAT
YOU SHOULD BE SITTING NEXT TO.
 Jeff: BRET, DAVID'S MAKING
THE PITCH THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE THE BEST PLAYER.
IT ONLY MATTERS THAT YOU'RE
PERCEIVED AS THE BEST OF WHO IS
LEFT.
 I'M NOT THINKING TO THE FINAL
THREE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO
TOMORROW, AND I'LL THINK ABOUT
TOMORROW TOMORROW.
 Jeff: HANNAH, IS IT AT ALL
POSSIBLE THAT BRET HAS NOT
CONSIDERED FINAL THREE
COMBINATIONS?
 I THINK HE'S DEFINITELY
THOUGHT ABOUT THE FINAL THREE,
BUT I THINK HE'S THINKING ABOUT
HOW HE GETS THERE.
AND I THINK WE ALL ARE.
 Jeff: HANNAH, WHO ARE THE
BIGGEST THREATS?
 WE'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER,
DAVID IS A THREAT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A SECRET.
 Jeff: BRET...
 DAVID IS A THREAT.
 AND I THINK BRET WOULD BE
VERY HARD TO SIT NEXT TO.
 Jeff: SO, DAVID, IF I COULD
FEMALE YOUR PULSE, IS IT, DUH,
DUH, DUH, DUH.
 I THINK I COULD BE GOING
HOME, BUT WHAT ARE YOU TO DO
OTHER THAN TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU
TRUST AND RELY ON THEIR LOYALTY
AND HOPE THAT REALLY DOES MEAN
SOMETHING.
 Jeff: IF IT IS YOU TONIGHT,
WHAT IS THE END OF THIS STORY?
WHILE I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
REALLY WANT TO BE SOLE SURVIVOR,
IF I CAN TAKE WHAT I'VE LEARNED
FROM THIS GAME, LIKE GREATER
CONFIDENCE, THEN APPLY IT TO MY
REAL LIFE, THEN EVEN IF I LOSE I
THINK I'VE WON.
 THAT'S WHY HE'S SUCH A HUGE
THREAT.
HE HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STORY.
ON DAY ONE HE WAS SCARED OF
BIRDS.
 THEY DID CHASE ME.
 AND NOW HE'S WON INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY A COUPLE TIME, HAS MADE
PEOPLE SMILE, HAS MADE PEOPLE
LAUGH, HAS MADE PEOPLE CRY.
 WHO DID I MAKE CRY?
 YOU MADE ME CRY.
 OH.
 YOU ALWAYS CRY.
 Jeff: BRET, HOW MUCH
PRESSURE IS THERE KNOWING, I AM
LEGITIMATELY CLOSE TO HAVING A
REAL SHOT AT THAT MONEY?
 YOU KNOW, AT FIRST IT'S LIKE,
IT'S MARATHON, YOU'RE TRYING TO
GET THERE, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
THERE.
THEN YOU WAKE UP AND YOU'RE
LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I'VE WORKED SO
HARD TO GET TO DAY 36.
NOW TOMORROW IS DAY 37 AND I GOT
THROUGH THERE.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT IT TO END.
IF IT'S ME, I'M GOING TO BE
DEVASTATED.
 Jeff: HANNAH, THE LAST
WOMAN STANDING.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THE YOUNGEST PERSON
LEFT IN THIS GAME.
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT TONIGHT'S
VOTE?
 YEAH, I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS
ABOUT THE VOTE.
YOU KNOW, THE NUMBERS ARE
GETTING SMALLER AND EVERYONE
FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE A GAME
PLAN, AND FOR SOME OF US, WE'RE
WRONG.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO IS
GOING HOME.
ADAM, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 JEFF.
I WOULD REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
LIKE TO GET TO THE FINAL FOUR.
I THINK A FEW BULLETS MIGHT EVEN
BY COMING MY WAY TONIGHT, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
 Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR ADAM WILL NOT
COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, DAVID.
BRET.
ONE VET DAVID, ONE VOTE BRET.
TWO VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE BRET.
BRET.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES DAVID.
TWO VOTES BRET.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
16th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
BRET.
 THE FLIP OF FLIPS AGAIN.
 Jeff: BRET, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 DAVID, CONGRATULATIONS.
THE REST OF YOU, YOU JUST LOST
$1 MILLION.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WELL, THERE IS ONLY
ONE REASON YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO
BLINDSIDE EACH OTHER, AND THAT
HAS TO BELIEVE BECAUSE ALL OF
YOU BELIEVE EVERY PERSON HERE IS
A LEGITIMATE THREAT TO WIN THIS
GAME.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 GOING OUT LIKE THIS SUCKS.
IF THOSE WERE TWO PEOPLE THAT
HAD SOME SORT OF A BRAIN, THEY
WOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT DAVID IS
GOING TO EAT THEM ALIVE AN THEY
WOULD HAVE VOTED THEM OUT
TONIGHT, BUT I WILL SAY, THIS IS
A GREAT GAME.
IT BROUGHT ME OUT OF MICHELE
FINALLY.
HOW LUCKY AM I TO HAVE ACTUALLY
HAVE BEEN PART OF "SURVIVOR"
AFTER BEING FAN FOR SO MANY
YEARS?
I DIDN'T REALIZE LOYALTY RAN SO
DEEP IN THIS GAME.
I'M IMPRESSED, HONESTLY.
I'M BLOWN AWAY BY TONIGHT.
 I'M LOSING MY MIND THINKING
ABOUT IT.
KEN AND HANNAH SAVED ME.
 THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
OVER THERE THAT EITHER LOOK AT
BRET AS THE BIG UNCLE, THE BEST
FRIEND.
 I RECOGNIZE THAT.
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT HE IS A
LOT LESS LIKELY TO WIN A
CHALLENGE THAN DAVID IS.
YOU HAVE BECOME A PHYSICAL
THREAT.
 I SHOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE
TALKING, BUT YET HERE I STAND.
 I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU
WILL POSSIBLY SAY THAT WILL MAKE
ME THINK THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE A
HUGE MISTAKE TONIGHT.
 THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE PATH
WITH DAVE GONE.
IF I HAD TURNED ON KEN, KEN
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MAD AT ME,
AND SO I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER
TO TAKE A REALLY BIG GAMBLE.
I GET THAT DAVID IS A GIGANTIC
THREAT TO TO WIN.
 KEN IS THE MOST LIKELY PERSON
TO WIN AT THE FINAL FOUR.
IF HE WIN, ALL HE TALKS ABOUT IS
LOYALTY AND TRUST, AND YOU KNOW
HE HAS A FINAL THREE WITH DAVE.
OH, MY GOD, WHAT?
I'M SO BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT.
WE JUST PUT DAVE, THE BIGGEST
THREAT IN THE GAME, ONE
CHALLENGE AWAY FROM THE FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WE HAVE TO WIN TOMORROW.
 I KNOW.
 WE HAVE TO WIN.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YES, WE ARE.
 Jeff: KEN, I GOT TO TAKE IT
BACK.
 THANK YOU FOR THIS.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
FOR THE LAST TIME IMMONTI BACK
UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO USE A LONG POLE TO
MANEUVER A BOWL THROUGH A
CHANNEL.
WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP, YOU'LL
PLACE THE BOWL, HEAD BACK FOR
YOUR NEXT ONE.
THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE SITS ON A
SPRING, WHICH MEANS IF YOU HIT
IT TOO HARD, IT WOBBLES, YOUR
BOWLS DROP, YOU GOT TO START
OVER.
FIRST PERSON TO STACK 13 BOWLS
OR THE PERSON WITH THE MOST
BOWLS AT THE END OF 30 MINUTES
WINS IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT
AT THAT FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
BIGGEST STAKES SO FAR.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
LAST SHOT FOR A GUARANTEED SPOT
AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
ALL THE MODELS RIGHT HERE.
KEN IS OUT NOW HANNAH NOW DAVID.
EVERYONE MAKING THEIR WAY
THROUGH THAT FIRST CHANNEL.
IT'S EASY AT FIRST.
STAY ON YOUR OWN PACE.
 OH, GEEZ.
 Jeff: ADAM DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK.
DAVID PLACES HIS FIRST.
KEN PLACES HIS FIRST.
HANNAH STILL WORKING ON HER
FIRST.
ADAM STILL WORKING ON HIS FIRST.
THERE'S HANNAH WITH HER FIRST.
DAVID BACK WITH HIS SECOND.
THERE ARE 13 TOTAL.
IF NOBODY GETS TO 13 BY 3
MINUTES, -- BY 30 MINUTES,
WHOEVER HAS THE TALLEST STACK
WINS.
WHOEVER HAS THE TALLEST STACK
WINS.
IT IS ADAM IN THE LEAD WITH TEN.
HANNAH PLACES HER TENTH.
KEN PLACES HIS TENTH AND WE ARE
TIED, EXCEPT DAVID WITH EIGHT.
DAVID HITS HIS STRUCTURE AND
LOSES EVERYTHING.
KEN HAS HIS 11th BOWL.
KEN IS IN THE LEAD OVER ADAM.
HANNAH LOSES EVERYTHING.
ALL THIS WORK GONE.
IT IS NOW KEN WITH 11, ADAM WITH
WITH TEN.
WIND IS BLOWING.
 NICE AND STEADY, KEN!
 Jeff: KEN IS GOING FOR
NUMBER 12 WHILE ADAM JUST
WATCHING.
ADAM NOW STEPPING OFF HIS
PLATFORM HOPING THAT WIND IS
GOING TO KNOCK KEN'S STACK OVER.
KEN HAS ONE BOWL LEFT.
ADAM'S STRATEGY WORKED.
KEN LOST EVERYTHING.
IT IS NOW ADAM IN THE LEAD.
 NO, NO, NO!
ADAM LOSES EVERYTHING AND WE'RE
BACK STARTING OVER AGAIN.
THIS IS PROOF ONCE AGAIN WHY YOU
NEVER EVER GIVE UP IN THIS GAME.
DAVID WORKING THAT FOURTH.
DAVID DROPS AGAIN.
IT'S NOW HANNAH IN THE LEAD
WHILE ADAM AND KEN RACING TO GET
BACK IN THIS.
NOTHING ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE IS
EASY.
JUST UNDER TWO MINUTES LEFT IN
THIS CHALLENGE.
HANNAH IN THE LEAD AS SHE PLACES
HER TENTH.
KEN TRYING THE CATCH HER WITH
HIS TENTH.
DAVID NOW WORKING ON HIS SIXTH
AND ADAM IS SITTING ON EIGHT.
ADAM JUST WATCHING ONCE AGAIN,
TAKING THE DEFENSIVE POSITION IN
THIS GAME TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE
MESS UP.
HERE COMES KEN WITH HIS TENTH.
HANNAH IS JUST HANGING OUT.
DAVID WORLD ON HIS SEVENTH, AND
JUST LIKE THAT DAVID LOSES
EVERYTHING AGAIN.
LESS THAN ONE MINUTE LEFT.
EVERYBODY WAITING NOW.
THIS IS A GAME OF CHICKEN.
WHO IS GOING TO MOVE FIRST,
WHAT'S THE WIND GOING TO DO.
MEANWHILE, DAVID IS RACING TO
GET BACK IN IT.
HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.
TIME?
 Jeff: 30 SECONDS.
KEN GOING TO PLACE HIS TENTH,
ATTEMPTING TO TIE HANNAH.
ADAM HOPING IN THESE LAST FEW
SECONDS SOMETHING HAPPENS.
KEN GOING TO GO FOR 11.
THERE ARE 15 SECONDS LEFT.
ADAM WILL ONLY WIN IF BOTH
HANNAH AND KEN DROP.
KEN GOING FOR IT.
TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE...
THAT IS IT.
WE ARE TIED 10-10.
WE WILL HAVE A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN
HANNAH AND KEN.
WHAT A CHALLENGE.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
IT IS A FIVE-MINUTE SHOWDOWN.
HERE ARE THE RULINGS.
AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST BOWLS
STACKED WINS.
IF YOU GET TO 13, YOU WIN.
THIS IS IT, SPOT AT THE FINAL
THREE.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU BOTH.
 GOOD LUCK.
 Jeff: SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW THIS PLAYS
NOW.
KEN OUT OF THE GATE VERY
AGGRESSIVE.
HANNAH BACK TO HER SAME STRATEGY
OF SLOW AND STEADY.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THIS TIME IS
YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES.
YOU'RE NOT GOING FOR HALF HOUR,
SO THAT MAY PLAY TO THE
ADVANTAGE OF BEING MORE
AGGRESSIVE.
KEN HAS HIS FIRST.
HANNAH STAYING TRUE TO HER FORM,
GOING VERY SLOW.
GOING TO LET KEN EITHER WIN OR
LOSE BASED ON HOW AGGRESSIVELY
HE'S PLAYING.
HANNAH HAS HER FIRST.
KEN WORKING ON HIS SECOND.
KEN IN THE LEAD.
38 DAYS COMES DOWN TO A
FIVE-MINUTE SHOWDOWN, A DO-OR-
DIE OR POTENTIALLY GO HOME
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE YOU
BECOME THE 10th MEMBER OF
THE JURY.
HANNAH WITH HER SECOND BOWL.
KEN WITH THREE.
HANNAH WITH TWO.
KEN STILL IN THE LEAD.
HANNAH NOW PICKING UP THE PACE.
HERE COMES THE WIND.
KEN NOW HAS THE WAIT.
IT IS TOO RISKY TO TRY TO PLACE
A BOWL ON THAT STACK, WHICH
OPENS THE DOOR FOR HANNAH WITH
HER FOURTH.
WE ARE TIED NOW 4-4.
KEN GOING TO TRY THE PLACE HIS
FIFTH.
IT IS TOUCHY.
 SLOW, KEN, SLOW.
 Jeff: KEN PLACES HIS FIFTH.
KEN BACK IN THE LEAD.
HERE'S HANNAH WITH HER FIFTH.
AND WE ARE DOWN TO ONE MINUTE
LEFT IN THIS CHALLENGE.
HANNAH HAS HER FIFTH.
KEN WORKING ON HIS SIXTH.
 GOOD JOB, KEN.
 Jeff: HANNAH RACING BACK
FOR HER SIXTH.
CAN SHE CATCH KEN?
45 SECONDS LEFT.
WE ARE TIED AT FIVE.
KEN THROUGH THE MAZE WITH HIS
SIXTH.
HANNAH RIGHT BEHIND WITH HER
SIXTH.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 Jeff: 30 SECONDS LEFT.
AS KEN PLACES HIS SIXTH, HANNAH
WORKING ON HER SIXTH.
THIS IS IT.
HANNAH PLACES HER SIXTH.
GOING FOR HER SEVENTH.
KEN WORKING ON HIS SEVENTH.
 GET IT ON THERE.
 Jeff: TEN SECONDS LEFT.
WE'LL GO TO ANOTHER SHOWDOWN IF
KEN CAN'T GET.
THERE WE ARE TIED 6-6.
 CAREFUL.
 Jeff: FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.
KEN PLACES HIS SEVENTH AND KEN
WINS HIS FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT AT
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL IN AN
EPIC FINISH TO THIS SEASON.
 WHEW.
 Jeff: HUGE EFFORT.
THAT WAS DOWN TO THE LAST
SECONDS.
 YOU DID IT, BUDDY.
 AWESOME JOB.
 Jeff: KEN, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD BOY, KEN.
 Jeff: FOR THE FOURTH TIME
IMMUNITY IS YOURS, AND MOST
IMPORTANTLY, YOU'VE GONE AS FAR
AS YOU CAN GO IN THIS GAME.
YOU WILL BE AT THAT FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ONE BIG DECISION LEFT TONIGHT,
WHO WILL BE THAT TENTH AND FINAL
MEMBER OF THE JURY?
ONE THING WE KNOW, IT WILL NOT
BE YOU?
AFTER 38 DAYS, DAVID, HANNAH,
ADAM, FOR SOMEBODY YOUR DREAM
WILL FALL ONE DAY SHORT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 FOUR TIMES AFTER THE MERGE I
WAS ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITH THIS
NECKLACE HERE, AND I'M IN.
I'M ONE OF THE THREE.
NOW WHO DO I WANT TO SIT BY?
IT'S GOING TO BE THE ABSOLUTE
TOUGHEST DECISION.
 CONGRATULATIONS, KEN.
 FINAL THREE.
UNBELIEVABLE.
 NICELY DONE.
 THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE DIDN'T
GO AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED, BUT
I'M HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT THAT
KEN WON, BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH
FAITH IN KEN'S LOYALTY AND TRUST
TOWARD ME, AND IF IT REALLY IS
REAL, WORST-CASE SCENARIO I GO
TO A FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE
AGAINST ADAM, WHICH I'VE GOTTEN
PRETTY GOOD AT.
 NO MATTER WHAT I'M WRITING
DAVE'S NAME DOWN TONIGHT AND YOU
TOO?
 100%.
LET ME DEAL WITH KEN, OKAY?
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
 MY IDEA AT TRIBAL LAST NIGHT
WAS TO SET UP THE KILL FOR
DAVID, BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO
CONVINCE KEN TO VOTE OUT DAVID
OR ELSE IT GOES TO A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE AGAINST THE GUY WHO
HAS BEEN MAKING FIRE THIS ENTIRE
TIME.
BRET CALLED ME A FLIP-FLOPPER
LAST NIGHT, BUT SINCE THE MERGE
THERE IS ONE PERSON I HAVE NEVER
FLIPPED ON OR NEVER CONSIDERED
FLIPPING ON.
 ME.
 YEAH, I THINK I'VE BEEN ONE
OF THE MORE LOYAL PLAYERS.
THAT'S WHY THEY ALL THINK I'M AN
IDIOT.
 THEY THINK I'M AN IDIOT, TOO.
I BELIEVE IN TRUST LOOK WHERE
IT'S GOTTEN US.
 CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?
IF YOU TAKE DAVE, WE ALL LOSE.
 BUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE WE MET
IN THIS GAME, I'M CLOSEST TO
DAVE.
WE BONDED LITERALLY ON DAY ONE.
HANNAH'S PITCH IS IF WE TAKE
DAVID TO THE FINAL THREE, WE
LOSE.
I UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE'S COMING
FROM.
DAVID HAS PLAYED A HELL OF A
GAME, BUT MY WHOLE GAME HAS BEEN
BASED ON LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP.
FROM DAY ONE I'VE BEEN SAYING,
ME AND DAVE, TO THE END.
 JUST TRUST ME, PLEASE HAVE
TRUST IN ME, HAVE FAITH IN ME.
 THAT YOU ARE SMART AND
CAPABLE AND I SHOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE YOU.
 IT'S SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE
KEN WORKS BY A DIFFERENT CODE.
HE'S ALL ABOUT TRUST AND HONOR.
EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT THE SMARTEST
GAME MOVE.
 I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE
KEN.
WE HAD A FINAL THREE AGREEMENT
ON LIKE DAY THREE, AND SO IT
WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE FOR YOU
AND HANNAH TO GO AFTER EACH
OTHER THAN IT WOULD TO GO AFTER
ME.
 NOT AT ALL.
I'M SORRY THAT I WAS ROOTING
AGAINST YOU SO HARD AT THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, BUT I
BASICALLY GAVE UP MY SHOT AT
IMMUNITY JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DIDN'T WIN.
IF THEY DON'T VOTE YOU OUT, I
LOSE THE GAME.
SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
SO I END UP IN THIRD PLACE OVER
FOURTH.
I'M IN THE HERE FOR THAT.
 YEAH.
 THE ONLY WAY I HAVE ANY KIND
OF CHANCE WHATSOEVER IS IF YOU
GO HOME.
THAT'S IT.
DAVE AND I BOTH KNOW THAT WE'RE
VOTING FOR THE OTHER PERSON.
IT'S ENTIRELY CLEAR, AND, YOU
KNOW, PLAYING AROUND IT WOULD
JUST BE POINTLESS AT THIS POINT.
MEANWHILE, HANNAH'S OUT IN THE
WATER RIGHT NOW WITH KEN
HOPEFULLY TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM
TO VOTE OUT DAVE TONIGHT, BUT IF
THAT DOESN'T WORK, THEN I NEED
MY PLAN "B," WHICH IS ATTEMPTING
TO BEAT DAVE IN A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE.
I'M PRACTICING MAKING FIRE WITH
A MACHETE, WITH FLINT, BECAUSE I
KNOW IF THE VOTES ARE TIED
TONIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO BE DOING.
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.
 I'M SO NERVOUS.
I SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE TONIGHT
SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER.
IT REALLY SHOULD.
BUT NOT WITH THESE PEOPLE.
 WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THIS,
MAN, I TRUST YOU 100%, SO I
DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY HARD SELL
TO YOU BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I
HAVE TO.
OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO WRITE
DOWN ADAM'S NAME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
AND IF YOU VOTE ADAM, IT WILL BE
A TIE.
THEN I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
MAKING FIRE.
OBVIOUSLY MY FAITH RESTS
ENTIRELY IN YOUR HANDS, BUT, I
JUST TRUST YOU.
THAT'S IT.
 WE'RE GOOD.
 YEAH.
THANKS A LOT.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.
 SO TONIGHT I CAN VOTE OUT MY
CLOSEST FRIEND, OR I CAN VOTE
AGAINST ADAM AND THEN HE AND
DAVID WILL HAVE A FIRE CHALLENGE
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, AND LET
THEM FIGHT AND FIGHT LIKE MEN
AND SEE WHO COMES OUT ON TOP.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS,
JESSICA, ZEKE, WILL, SUNDAY,
JAY, AND BRET VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THE PENULTIMATE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
NOT THE, LAST BUT IT MIGHT BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT.
WHO WILL GO TO THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL AND WHO WILL BECOME THE
FINAL MEMBER OF THE JURY?
SO LET'S START WITH ONE OF THE
MOST DRAMATIC CHALLENGES I'VE
EVER SEEN.
HANNAH, I REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME YOU VOTED.
IT TOOK YOU SO LONG I THOUGHT
YOU GOT LOST.
 YEAH.
AND THE THING WITH WITH THE
CHALLENGE TODAY, TOO...
 Jeff: HOLD ON.
I'M NOT DONE PAYING YOU A
COMPLIMENT.
 OKAY, JEFF PROBST.
 Jeff: NOW WHEN YOU VOTE YOU
MARCH WITH AUTHORITY.
YOU'RE THE WOMAN WHO HAD A PAN
ATTACK WHILE WATCHING A
CHALLENGE.
 YEAH, I DID, YEAH.
 Jeff: AND HERE YOU ARE
NEARLY TAKING OUT KEN.
IT WAS CRUSHING TO BE DEFEATED
THAT WAY, BUT WE FOUGHT IT OUT.
 Jeff: ADAM, WHEN IT CAME
DOWN TO SUDDEN DEATH, YOU CAN'T
DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WATCH.
 I ACTUALLY PUT MYSELF IN THAT
POSITION TODAY, JEFF.
MY ONLY GOAL TODAY WAS TO MAKE
SURE DAVE DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY.
 Jeff: WOW.
DAVID?
 Jeff: ADAM IS A VERY
STRATEGIC PLAYER, BUT HE
RECOGNIZES THROUGHOUT THE LAST
38 DAYS I'VE PLAYED A BETTER
GAME THAN HE HAS.
 I'M GLAD HE ADMITS IT.
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RIGHT
HERE SAYING DAVE IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT IN THE GAME BECAUSE HE'S
BEEN UP HERE THE WHOLE TIME, AND
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOOTING AND
MISSING JUST UNDERNEATH.
 UP HERE.
I'M SORRY.
WAY, WAY UP HERE.
 Jeff: SO KEN, YOU ARE THE
ONLY ONE RIGHT NOW CERTAIN THAT
YOU'LL BE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.çó
 YEAH.
 Jeff: SO TODAY YOU HAD TO
BE THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
 YEAH, TODAY IMMEDIATELY IT
WAS, CAN I TALK TO YOU?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
I IMMEDIATELY SAID, I STILL NEED
TO BE ME.
I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND FISH.
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR WHAT YOU'VE
GOT TO SAY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
CHANGE JUST BECAUSE I'M WEARING
THIS NECKLACE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THE MATH IS PRETTY SIMPLE.
CAN'T VOTE FOR KEN.
DAVID, WHAT WAS YOUR PITCH?
 WELL, I MADE A FINAL-THREE
DEAL WITH KEN ON DAY THREE OR
FOUR, AND HERE WE ARE ABOUT TO
GO INTO FINAL THREE, AND THE
THING IS, KEN HAS BROUGHT A
DEPTH OF TRUST AND LOYALTY,
HONOR AND INTEGRITY LIKE NO
OTHER SURVIVOR EVER.
THOSE THINGS ARE EXTINCT IN THIS
GAME.
AND I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY MORE
THAN I DO KEN, AND I HAVE SINCE
DAY THREE OR FOUR.
 Jeff: SO I'VE BEEN WITH
YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN WITH ME.
I'M STILL HERE.
 I'M NOR WORRIED.
THAT'S RIGHT.
 Jeff: ADAM, WHAT'S YOUR
PITCH?
 LOOK, THERE COMES A TIME IN
THE GAME WHERE YOU HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO
WRING YOUR ALLIES ALL THE WAY TO
THE END, AND NOW HE HAS TO MAKE
A CHOICE THAT'S BASED ON MORE
THAN JUST LOYALTY.
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I CAN
TAKE TO THE END THAT I CAN WIN
THIS GAME FOR MY FAMILY.
 Jeff: HANNAH, RIGHT NOW IT
SOUNDS LIKE THESE TWO ARE
BATTLING IT OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
 YEAH, I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
ANY OF THE THREE OF US COULD BE
GOING, BUT WE SAW A LOT OF TRUTH
COME OUT OF THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
WE SAW BRET LEAVE,
CONGRATULATING ONE OF THE THREE
OF US, SO THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN JUST LOYALTY AT PLAY
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: KEN, YOU WERE NODDING
AS EACH ONE OF THE THREE TALKED,
AS THOUGH YOU AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING THEY'RE SAYING.
 EVERY POINT IS VALID.
THESE ARE ALL INTELLIGENT, GOOD,
BRIGHT PEOPLE.
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE WALKED
THROUGH THIS GAME EASILY.
THEY'VE ALL EVOLVED AND GROWN
AND SHIFTED AND DONE AMAZING
THINGS PERSONALLY BUT ALSO
SOCIALLY WITHIN THE GAME.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS
MOST IMPORTANT AND HOW DOES THAT
DIB AT THE PRESENT TIME OR
AFFECT YOUR DECISIONS -- HOW
DOES THAT DICTATE OR AFFECT YOUR
DECISIONS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE WHAT COULD
BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST DECISION
IN THIS GAME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
HANNAH, YOU'RE UP.
 GOOD LUCK.
 YOU TOO.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE DAVE.
ADAM.
ONE VOTE DAVE.
ONE VOTE ADAM.
DAVID.
TWO VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE ADAM.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
17th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE 10th AND FINAL MEMBER OF
OUR JURY, DAVID.
 SO CLOSE.
 Jeff: YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.
 YOU DID AWESOME, DAVE.
 Jeff: GREAT GAME.
 I LOVE YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: DAVID, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 PLAYING "SURVIVOR" IS THE
BIGGEST DREAM I'VE EVER HAD, AND
I'M IS GRATEFUL I GOT THE PLAY
IT WITH ALL OF YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: HANNAH, KEN, ADAM,
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
THREE.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT FOR
YOUR FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.
 THANK YOU.
 OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO BE SOLE
SURVIVOR, I WANTED TO WIN THE
MILLION DOLLARS, BUT I'VE HAD SO
MANY PERSONAL GROWTH FROM THIS
EXPERIENCE THAT I'LL WALK OUT OF
THIS GAME A NEW MAN, AND THAT'S
WORTH MORE THAN A MILLION
DOLLARS.
SO IN A WAY I REALLY DID WIN.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELL, GIVEN WHERE HE
STARTED, DAVID LASTED A LONG
TIME.
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST OUT.
DAVID CAME IN WITH A FEAR OF
EVERYTHING AND GREW ENTER A
PLAYER THAT EVERYONE ELSE
FEARED.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC
TRANSFORMATIONS EVER.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE DOWN TO IT.
THE FINAL THREE.
THIS IS IT.
"SURVIVOR" FINALE CONTINUES
AFTER THIS.
 THIS IS OUR LAST MORNING ON
THIS BEACH.
IT'S DAY 39 AND WE ARE HERE.
I SHOULD BE LIKE, OH, IF SUN,
BUT ALL I CAN THINK IS I'M
HUNGRY.
 SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
GENERATION, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW
TO JUST SIT AND APPRECIATE
SOMETHING.
TALKING THE ENTIRE TIME.
DAY 39.
I'M HERE.
I'M SMILING NOW.
I CAN BREATHE.
AND TO BE THE LAST PERSON OF MY
GEN X TRIBE, IT FEELS DAMN GOOD.
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THROUGH IN
THIS GAME WITHOUT EVER DOING A
LOT OF WORK, AND I DID THE EXACT
OPPOSITE.
I PLAYED AN OLD-SCHOOL STYLE
GAME, AND I PLAYED WITH A LEVEL
OF LOYALTY THAT MOST PEOPLE
DON'T SHOW IN THIS GAME.
LET'S PUT SOME MORE PAPER ON
THERE.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THERE'S ONE MOTIVATING FACTOR
BEHIND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I
DO, AND THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
I HAVE TO WIN THIS TONIGHT.
TO GIVE ME AND MY DAUGHTER A
BETTER LIFE.
TREE MAIL.
TREE MAIL.
 OH, MY GOD.
WOW.
MAPLE SYRUP.
 BAGELS, BAGELS.
 UNREAL.
 AND ORANGE JUICE.
I STARTED THIS GAME HAVING A LOT
OF THE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES OF
MILLENNIALS.
I WAS LIKE A NEUROTIC, ANXIOUS
PERSON, BUT I'VE GROWN INTO THE
PLAYER I AM.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
 I KNOW.
THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN ABOUT
LEARNING TO BE RESILIENT AND
STRONG AND LEARNING TO HOLD MY
OWN.
DAY 39 EGGS.
TONIGHT TRIBAL COUNCIL IS THE
FIRING SQUAD THAT WILL TEST MY
PERSONAL GROWTH.
IT'S ABOUT BEING CALM AND
CONFIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE I
PLAYED A BETTER GAME THAN BOTH
ADAM AND KEN, AND I BELIEVE I
DESERVE TO WIN $1 MILLION.
NO ONE FROM OUR ORIGINAL TRIBE
THOUGHT THAT THE THREE OF US
WOULD BE SITTING HERE DOING
THIS.
 NOBODY.
 I HAVE PLAYED A REALLY HARD
GAME.
I FOUND HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.
I WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
I'VE BLINDSIDED OTHERS, BUT I
HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A WAY THAT
MADE ME A TARGET.
THIS HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE
HARDEST THING THAT I'VE EVER
DONE IS LEAVE MY FAMILY AND MY
MOM IN THIS TIME BECAUSE OF HER
CANCER.
IF SHE KNEW THAT I WAS THIS
CLOSE TO ACTUALLY WINNING, I CAN
ONLY IMAGINE HOW HAPPY IT WOULD
MAKE HER.
THAT'S WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD TO
STAY IN THIS GAME.
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT I
POSSIBLY CAN TONIGHT TO WIN IT.
FOR HER.
I CANNOT LET THIS CHANCE SLIP
AWAY.
I CANNOT LET THIS CHANCE SLIP
AWAY.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY: MICHELLE,
TAYLOR, CHRIS, JESSICA, ZEKE,
WILL, SUNDAY, JAY, BRET, AND
DAVID VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
HANNAH, KEN, ADAM,
CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: IT REALLY IS QUITE AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT TO GET TO DAY 39.
BUT IT IS NOT THE GOAL.
THE GOAL IS TO WIN THIS GAME.
TONIGHT THE JURY, TEN PEOPLE
THAT YOU VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME,
WILL DECIDE WHO WINS.
JURY, SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN
COMING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR A
LONG TIME, WAITING FOR THIS
MOMENT.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO COMPOSE YOUR THOUGHTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO BEGIN FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
TAYLOR, GET US STARTED.
 ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, I THINK I'M ONE OF THE
MORE SPONTANEOUS MILLENNIALS
HERE, AND MY VOTE IS NOT SET
YET.
I WANT YOU GUYS TO PITCH TO ME
WHY I SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU.
SO HANNAH, START US OFF.
 YEAH, I'D JUST LIKE THE START
BY SAYING I HOPE THAT EVERYONE
STAYS AS OPEN AS YOU.
I KNOW SOME OF MY MOVES WERE NOT
AS FLASHY.
I KNOW SOMETIMES THEY SEEMED
SPORADIC, BUT I FEEL LIKE I
PLAYED A VERY STRATEGIC
CUTTHROAT GAME, AND I THINK I
DESERVE YOUR VOTE BECAUSE I PUT
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER ON THE JURY
IN THE ORDER THAT THEY DID.
I STARTED THIS GAME SO SCARED IT
WAS GOING TO BE ME THAT I WAS A
MESS.
LIKE I WAS A MESS AT MY FIRST
TRIBAL.
I WAS A MESS AT CAMP.
DAY TWO ME WOULD BE RUNNING AND
CRYING, BUT I'M READY, AND BRING
IT ON AND I'M READY TO EXPLAIN
WHY I MADE MY DECISIONS.
 OKAY.
 YEAH.
 KEN?
 I FEEL LIKE I SHOWED YOU AS
WELL AS SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE
THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THIS
GAME.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GAME.
YOU ALSO ARE A HUMAN BEING
WITHIN THIS GAME, MAKING MOVES
AND BUILDING LOYALTY ALLOWED ME
TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS GAME,
AND I THINK THAT DESERVES
THROUGH CREDIT.
 TAYLOR, I THINK I SHOULD GET
YOUR VOTE BECAUSE I BELIEVE I
PLAYED THE BEST GAME OUT OF
THREE OF US HERE.
I PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION TO
NOT BE THE PERSON GOING HOME AND
TO KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT I WANTED
TO GO TO THE END WITH SAFE AT
EACH TRIBAL COUNCIL.
I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY
TONIGHT, BUT I'LL LEAVE IT AT
THAT FOR NOW.
 YEAH, WELL, THANK YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: SUNDAY, YOU'RE UP.
 YOU KNOW, WE'VE MADE A LOT
THIS SEASON ABOUT THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GEN XERS AND
MILLENNIALS.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TRIED
TO DO WAS TO COME IN AND BE
ADAPTABLE AND FLEXIBLE.
MY QUESTION TO EACH OF YOU IS:
HOW WERE YOU ADAPTABLE IN THIS
GAME, AND DO YOU THINK YOU
PLAYED MORE LIKE A MILLENNIAL OR
A GEN XER REGARDLESS OF YOUR
AGE?
KEN?
 I'M VERY OLD SCHOOL.
I COME FROM AN OLD FAMILY.
I'M THE YOUNGEST.
IT WAS VERY BLACK AND WHITE FOR
ME.
YOU DO THIS, YOU DON'T DO THIS,
THAT'S IT.
 YOU HAVE A SCALE LIKE
ADAPTDABLE AND UNMOVABLE...
 ONE THROUGH TEN, WHERE AM I
AT?
 I'D SAY I'M CLOSER TO BEING
MORE RIGID THAN ADAPTABLE, BUT
THERE IS ANOTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE
VERY ADAPTABLE, AS QUICKLY AS
EVERY FIVE MINUTES, AND THAT'S
CALLED A FLIPPER.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU.
ADAM?
 WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU
IS THE GEN X OF "SURVIVOR" WHO
MAY HAVE DONE VERY WELL IN
SEASON ONE OF THIS GAME.
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT, SOMEONE WHO WAS
SWITCHING THINGS UP TO THE POINT
WHERE HER ALLIES WEREN'T SURE
WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND I DO THINK I'M A COMBINATION
OF BOTH.
 I THINK THERE'S A POINT OF
CLARIFICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE
MADE, THOUGH.
YOU JUST SAID I'M ALL OVER THE
PLACE, BUT THE VOTE TO GET YOU
OUT, I FELT YOU AND BRET WERE A
DANGEROUS PAIR.
SO FOR ME, THAT MOVE WAS ME
BEING ADAPTDABLE TO A GAIN --
GAME THAT WAS CONSTANTLY MOVING,
BUT TO YOU OR BRET IT FEELS
UNPREDICTABLE, AND ADAM AS USUAL
WENT ALONG WITH MY MOVE.
 THOSE WERE TWO TIMES WHEN SHE
WENT ROGUE.
 I MADE A DECISION THAT I
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
 BETH TIMES I THINK THEY WERE
BAD STRATEGIC DECISIONS.
 AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE THE
RIGHT ONES AND THAT'S THE MOVE I
MADE.
 THANK YOU, SUNDAY.
 Jeff: JESSICA?
 KEN, YOU CAME INTO THIS GAME
PUTTING YOURSELF ON A PEDESTAL
BASED UPON BEING LOYAL AND BEING
HONEST.
I'M SHOCKED AT THE DECISION THAT
YOU MADE ON DAY 38 TO TAKE OUT
DAVID, THE ONE PERSON THAT YOU
PROMISED ON DAY TWO YOU WOULD
BRING TO THE END.
 THE DECISION THAT I MADE ON
DAY 38 WAS THE ABSOLUTE HARDEST
THING IN THIS GAME.
DAVID, YOU WERE MY NUMBER-TWO
ALLIANCE, NUMBER ONE IS MY
DAUGHTER.
ONLY REASON.
 THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY.

 Jeff: THANKS, JESSICA.
WILL, YOU'RE UP.
 FIRST I WANT TO SAY, KEN, AS
A PLAYER OF THE GAME, I
RESPECTED YOU SO MUCH MORE FOR
VOTING DAVID OUT THAN I DID FOR
ALL THE TALK OF RESPECT AND
LOYALTY FOR THE FIRST 38 DAYS.
ADAM, I'M MOST CONFUSED WITH
YOUR GAME.
THE BRET MOVE, YOU WERE ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS WITH
THAT VOTE AS WELL AS SEVERAL
OTHER VOTES, SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK WAS THE REASON YOU WEREN'T
ABLE TO GET THOSE MOVES TO WORK.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO
MOMENTS WHERE HANNAH WENT ROGUE.
I THINK IT WAS A TERRIBLE
DECISION TO LEAVE DAVID IN THE
GAME AND COULD HAVE BEEN A
MILLION DOLLAR MISTAKE.
 AND THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS
MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS AND
STICKING TO MY OWN GUNS AND ADAM
WOULD GET FRUSTRATED WHEN HE
WASN'T INCLUDED IN THEM.
HE WANTED TO VOTE DAVID FIRST
AND BRET HE WANTED TO VOTE YOU
OUT AFTER THAT.
IF I WERE TO LET THAT HAPPEN, I
WOULD LOSE THIS GUY'S TRUST AND
TRUST IS THE NUMBER-ONE THING
WITH KEN.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: ZEKE?
 PARTIES, CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 IT'S AN EXCITING TIME.
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE
EVOLUTION OF "SURVIVOR"
STRATEGY.
I THINK TONIGHT'S WINNER SHOULD
REPRESENT THAT EVOLUTION.
KEN, YOU PLAYED A LOYAL GAME.
YOU WERE A PROVIDER.
BUT YOU DID NOTHING TO EVOLVE
THE GAME.
SO HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.
ADAM, HANNAH, BOTH OF YOU, HOW
DID YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE
STRATEGIC EVOLUTION OF THE
WORLD'S GREATEST GAME?
ADAM?
 ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK HAS
HAPPENED IN RECENT SEASONS IS
THAT PEOPLE, ONCE THEY TAKE
CONTROL, THINK THEY HAVE TO
CONTINUE TO STAY IN CONTROL
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE
SEASON.
AND PEOPLE SAW THAT YOU WERE IN
CONTROL.
THEY SAW THAT CHRIS WAS IN
CONTROL.
SO I MADE SURE THAT AT THE FINAL
SIX, THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE IN
FRONT OF ME THAT WERE BIGGER
THREATS THAN I WAS, AND ONE OF
MY BEST ALLIES WAS A CHALLENGE
BEAST WHO COULD BEAT THEM AND WE
COULD TAKE THEM OUT.
 GREAT.
THANKS.
HANNAH, SAME QUESTION.
 THE IDEA OF BUILDING AN
ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE
AND WORKING WITH SOMEONE, YOU
AND I WORKED TOGETHER AS A
PARTNERSHIP WITH TRUST UNTIL WE
WENT AGAINST EACH OTHER IS WHAT
THE IDEA OF A TRUST CLUSTER IS,
AND I THINK THAT IS AN EVOLUTION
OF THE GAME.
AND I WOULD LIKE THE POINT OUT,
ADAM TALKS ABOUT LEAVING THREATS
IN THE GAME AS SORT OF SHIELDS.
I HAD THE SAME BELIEF, AND I
DECIDED WHEN THOSE SHIELDS WOULD
STAY AND WHEN THEY WOULD GO, NOT
ADAM.
I THINK ADAM'S VERY GOOD AT
TAKING CREDIT FOR A LOT OF
MOVES, BUT I FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR MOST OF THE JURY.
 GREAT.
THANKS, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ZEKE.

 Jeff: THANKS, ZEKE.
MICHELLE?
 WELL, FIRST TO YOU, HANNAH.
HOW MANY VOTES WERE YOU ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF?
 I WASN'T ON THE WRONG SIDE OF
ANY VOTES.
 BESIDES THE MICHAELA VOTE.
 EXCEPT THE MICHAELA VOTE.
 THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
GOOD JOB.
ADAM, CLARIFY WHY YOUR VICTORIES
OVERSHADOW THE BLUNDERS?
 BECAUSE I THINK I WAS ABLE TO
CORRECT FROM BLUNDERS, AND SOME
OF THOSE BLUPPEDDERS WERE THE
BLUNDERS OF MY ALLIANCE, AS
WELL.
 BUT THEY WERE NOT BLUNDERS.
THEY WERE MY CHOICES AND THEY
WERE STRATEGIC MOVES, AND THAT
IS WHAT SUCCEEDED.
 VOTING BRET OUT WAS NOT THE
RIGHT MOVE BECAUSE IT PUT DAVE
ONE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AWAY FROM
$1 MILLION.
 BUT THAT WAS A RISK BECAUSE I
KNEW THAT BRET WANTED TO GO TO
THE END WITH YOU, NOT ME.
AND I'M GOING TO OWN THAT.
DAY TWO ME WOULD LET ADAM TELL
ME THIS WAS SILLY.
DAY 39 ME IS NOT GOING TO TAKE
IT.
AND I MADE THE DECISIONS THAT I
WANTED TO MAKE.
 I APPRECIATE THAT.
 YEAH.
 TRULY FROM MY HEART, YOU
GUYS, GOOD JOB.
 THANKS, MICHELLE.
 Jeff: BRET?
 HEY, GUYS.
GOING TO START WITH YOU, KEN.
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU REALLY STARTED PLAYING THIS
GAME?
 I FELT AS THOUGH I STARTED
PLAYING RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT THAT I
WAS AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF GEN X.
SO ONE OF THE FIRST
CONVERSATIONS I HAD WAS GOING TO
JESS.
I SAID, YOU HAVE A HOME WITH
DAVID AND I AND CeCe AND
MADE HER FEEL SAFE WHEN BEFORE
SHE HADN'T FELT SAFE.
DAVID AND I, TWO OF THE
PEOPLE --
 KEN, THANK YOU.
SO YOU BELIEVE YOU'VE BEEN
PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE THE
BEGINNING.
 YES.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU.
ADAM, I WANT A BREAKDOWN, HOW
LONG IT TOOK TO VOTE OUT DAVE,
STARTING WITH THE SUNDAY VOTE
AND HOW THAT ALL WENT WRONG.
 WHEN HANNAH CAME TO ME WITH
THIS IDEA TO VOTE OUT SUNDAY
NOW, SHE WAS VERY SURE THAT THIS
WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.
OH, BY THE WAY, VOTING YOU OUT
WAS A HUGE BLUNDER, BECAUSE I
HAD THESE ALLIES THAT, ONE,
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE
DONE.
 THANKS.
 BUT I DID, ACTUALLY.
 NOT NEVER...
 CONTINUE TO UNDERESTIMATE ME.
 NEVER AT THE FINAL IS WHAT I
MEAN.
SO I MADE THAT BLUNDER IN
THINKING THAT WE WOULD GET OUT
DAVID AT THE FINAL FIVE.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M GOING TO MAKE MY DECISION.
 JAY, YOU'RE UP.
 ALL RIGHT.
I GOT ONE QUESTION, PRETTY
SIMPLE, JUST FOR YOU ADAM.
AT ONE POINT YOU SAID, WE'RE
BROTHERS.
I TOLD YOU NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENED I WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE END WITH ME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE ME TO TAKE
OUT DAVID WHEN YOU HAD THE
CHANCE?
 WE HAVE SUCH A CRAZY
RELATIONSHIP, WHERE WE ARE
BITTER RIVALS, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME, I DO GENUINELY LOVE YOU
LIKE A BROTHER, AND YOU KNOW
WHY.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
IT.
 YOU KNOW WHY I'M PLAYING THIS
GAME AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO ME.
OKAY.
AND YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
 OKAY.
COOL.
I'M GOOD.
 THANKS, JAY.
 Jeff: CHRIS, YOU'RE UP.
 WELL, ONE THING YOU GUYS
DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME IS I'M NOT A
COACH.
 YEAH.
YOU'RE NOT.
 I'M A TRIAL LAWYER BACK IN
OKLAHOMA.
 OH, GET OUT.
 BUT WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS
EXPERIENCE FOR ME IS IN MY WHOLE
CAREER I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
SERVE ON A JURY, BUT AS A TRIAL
LAWYER, I CAN'T TAKE THE LAWYER
HAT OFF, SO I'M GOING TO
ADVOCATE FOR ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.
I BELIEVE THAT STORY NEEDS TO
BEGIN, THOUGH, WITH TALKING
ABOUT A LITTLE SKINNY GUY
STANDING AND LURKING IN THE
SHADOWS, PLANNING THE DEMISE OF
ALL OF US.
OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVE
OVER HERE.
BUT ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU
FACED OFF WITH THE GIANT OF THE
GAME AND TOOK HIM OUT.
ADAM, IN MY OPINION, THE BIGGEST
MOVE IN THIS GAME WAS GOING TO
KEN, THE MOST LOYAL AND TRUSTED
ALLY OF DAVID, AND USING YOUR
SOCIAL GAME, YOUR CUNNING, YOUR
INTELLIGENCE AND TURNING KEN
AGAINST THE BIGGEST GIANT IN
THIS GAME, SOMETHING THAT NO ONE
ON THIS JURY DID, BUT YOU DID.
GOOD JOB, YOUNG MAN.
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE SOLE
SURVIVOR.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 AND I HOPE ALL OF YOU WILL
WRITE ADAM'S NAME DOWN.
 I'M AMAZED YOU THINK HE HAD
THE GUMPTION TO MAKE THAT VOTE
BECAUSE NO ONE CONVINCED ME TO
MAKE THAT VOTE AGAINST DAVID.
THAT WAS MY CHOICE.
 Jeff: DAVID, CLOSE US OUT.
 CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
THIS EXPERIENCE WAS
TRANSFORMATIVE.
I CAME IN UNDER THIS
DICTATORSHIP OF FEAR AND
ANXIETY, AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE
IT READY FOR A REVOLUTION.
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW DID
THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOUR LIFE
FOR THE BETTER?
WHAT EVOLUTION DID YOU UNDERGO,
AND HANNAH, WE CAN START WITH
YOU.
 YEAH.
THE PERSON I WAS ON DAY ONE
VERSUS THE PERSON I AM TODAY ARE
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
AND I WAS NOT BUILT FOR THIS
GAME.
I WAS TERRIFIED OF EVERYTHING.
I WAS SCARED TO PLAY IN THE
CHALLENGES.
AND PUSHING THROUGH THAT WAS
WHAT I LEARNED.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, AND
THAT'S SOMETHING I HOPE THE TAKE
INTO MY LIFE.
 Jeff:
 KEN?
 AS SOMEONE WHO FROM A VERY
YOUNG AGE WAS QUITE SOCIALLY
AWKWARD AND MANIFESTED THAT INTO
THE TICKS, THE TWITCHES AND
EVERYTHING ELSE I DEVELOPED OVER
TIME, AND NOW I'M PUTTING MYSELF
IN A POSITION TO BE SURROUNDED
BY 19 STRANGERS ON A SECLUDED
ISLAND WHERE I HAVE TO ENGAGE
AND INTERACT EVERY DAY.
YOU WANT THE TALK ABOUT TERROR,
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I WOULD
WAKE UP AND REALIZED, OH, I'M
PLAYING SURVIVOR.
I'D CLOSE MY EYES, CAN I PLEASE
JUST GO BACK THE DREAMING.
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT TODAY.
I PUT MYSELF IN SOCIAL POSITIONS
THAT NORMALLY I NEVER DO, AND
THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE I HAVE
ONE DRIVING FORCE THAT BROUGHT
ME HERE, AND THAT IS MY
DAUGHTER, AND I'M PLAYING FOR
HER.
SO THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO
OVERCOME TO GET HERE.
 THANK YOU.
ADAM?
 THIS HAS BEEN A PERSONAL
DREAM OF MINE SINCE I WAS NINE
YEARS OLD.
BUT TWO YEARS AGO I APPLIED FOR
THE BLOOD VERSUS WATER SEASON
WITH MY MOM, AND IT BECAME OUR
DREAM TOGETHER TO COME AND PLAY
THIS GAME.
AND SO THIS WASN'T ABOUT A
TRANSFORMATION FOR ME.
IT WAS ABOUT MY FAMILY THAT
REALLY, REALLY NEEDS IT RIGHT
NOW.
SEVEN MONTHS AGO MY MOM WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE FOUR LUNG
CANCER.
AND SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND IN THIS
WHOLE WORLD.
BUT EVEN IF I DON'T WIN TONIGHT,
I FEEL LIKE I WAS SUPPOSED TO
COME OUT HERE.
AND EVERY TIME I FOUND AN IDOL
AND WHEN I WON IMMUNITY AND
ESPECIALLY WHEN I GOT THE LOVED
ONE VISIT, I FELT LIKE WE WERE
WINNING TOGETHER.
AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS JOURNEY
WAS ABOUT FOR ME.
