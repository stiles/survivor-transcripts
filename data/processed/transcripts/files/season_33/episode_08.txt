 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE TAKALI TRIBE,
ADAM BETRAYED TAYLOR.
 I LIED TO YOU AND I SCREWED
YOU.
 FIGGY WAS THE SACRIFICE THAT
HAD TO HAPPEN.
 Jeff: AT THE VANUA TRIBE,
DAVID AND ZEKE WERE GROWING
CLOSER.
 ZEKE, I TRUST YOU A LOT.
I THINK WE'RE CUT FROM THE SAME
CLOTH.
 Jeff: AT THE IKA BULA
TRIBE, THE MILLENNIALS PLANNED
ON STICKING TOGETHER.
BUT JAY WANTED TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE.








 THIS DECISION COULD HONESTLY
MOLD THE REST OF MY GAME.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
JAY AND WILL VOTED WITH THE GEN
XERS.
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT,
MICHAELA.
 WHAT?
 Jeff: SENDING MICHAELA
HOME.
MICHAELA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING HANNAH IN THE DARK.
13 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 THAT WAS HARD, MAN.
 I KNOW.
SHE WAS MAD, MAN.
 TOLD YOU, DUDE.








I MADE A BIG-ASS MOVE TONIGHT,
AND I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET
PUNCHED IN THE FACE HONESTLY,
BUT MICHAELA'S THE CLOSER.
SHE CLOSED ON EVERY SINGLE
CHALLENGE, SO I NEEDED TO DO
THIS PREMERGE JUST TO BE SAFE,
AND PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF RIGHT
NOW.
 I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS KEEPING
US AROUND.
 YEAH.
 I KNOW.
WE DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE...
 YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE VOTED
WITH YOU ALL, THOUGH.
 BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DO
THAT.
 I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW.
AT THIS POINT I'M CLEARLY AT THE
BOTTOM OF THIS TRIBE.
I CAN'T TRUST ANY OF THESE
PEOPLE.
BEING COMPLETELY EXCLUDED FROM A
VOTE IS A SURE-FIRE WAY TO BREAK
TRUST AND CREATE ENEMIES.
JAY THINKS I'M PATHETIC IDIOT
THAT CAN'T SEE PAST HIS PRETTY
FACE.
 YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY HANDS
GETTING BLOODY.
 OKAY.
DEAL.
 I FELT LIKE A DAMN FOOL.
I'M JUST PLOTTING HOW TO GET
BACK AT THEM FOR NOT INCLUDING
ME IN THEIR GAME PLAY.
I HOPE I CAN GET MY REVENGE.
I'M READY TO PLAY.
 I SEE IT, HANNAH.
WE'RE WATCHING.
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT IT IS.
 IT'S COMING IN THIS
DIRECTION.
 WHAT DO THEY WANT?
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
 EVERYBODY SETTLE DOWN.
 WHAT'S GOING ON IN WHAT'S
GOING ON?
 THANK YOU, SIR.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.
EVERYONE GATHER AROUND.
 GATHER AROUND.
GATHER AROUND.
 IKA BULA TRIBE URGE YOU HAVE
FIVE MINUTES TO GATHER ALL
SUPPLIES YOU WILL NEED TO
SURVIVE FOR THE REST OF THIS
GAME.
GET ON THIS BOAT.
[CHEERING]
 YES, YES!
 THAT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS.
I WENT FROM TERRIFIED THAT I WAS
GOING HOME TO NOW I'M AT THE
MERGE.
WITHIN 24 HOURS, I CAN'T TELL
YOU HOW AWESOME THAT FEELS.
NOW THE WHOLE GAME IS JUST
OPENING UP FOR ME.
JAY'S WORD HAS BEEN TRUE SO FAR,
SO MAYBE I CAN TRUST WILL AND
JAY.
BUT YET I KNOW I STILL HAVE
CHRIS, AND I WANT THE SEE WHAT
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON.
 WE'RE IN THE STAYING HERE?
 NOPE.
 WHERE ARE WE GOING?
 I MADE THE MERGE.
TO GET TO THIS POINT MEANS SO
MUCH.
IT REALLY MEANS THE WORLD.
BUT THIS IS WHEN THINGS START TO
GET REALLY SERIOUS.
LIKE THIS IS THE POINT OF THE
GAME WHERE ALLIANCES AND
LOYALTIES ARE REALLY TESTED.
AND THE REALLY GREAT PLAYERS GET
SEPARATED FROM THE MEDIOCRE
PLAYERS.
AND I HOPE THAT I'M IN THE
FORMER GROUP.
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 HEY, LOOK.
 OH, MY GOD.
 ARE PEOPLE COMING IN?
 OH, MY GOD.
 A MERGE.
 I'M SO STOKED.
I WAS DOWN ON THE BOTTOM FOR SO
MANY DAYS, LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE THE
MERGE, AND HERE I AM.
THE CLOUDS HAVE CLEARED.
AND I'M UTTERLY THRILLED.
 I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE
WHO KNOWS WHO HAS MADE WHAT
CONNECTIONS AT THEIR OTHER
BEACH, BUT FOR NOW I'M JUST
EXCITED TO BE HERE.
 WE'RE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.
 THANK GOD.
IT'S THE MERGE.
THIS IS GIGANTIC.
TO BE BACK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT
YOU ORIGINALLY TRUSTED AND THAT
YOU WANT TO WORK WITH.
IT'S HUGE.
AND JAY AND TAYLOR, THOSE ARE
THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I CAN
TAKE TO THE END.
SO I'M BACK IN THE GAME.
 HI, GUYS.
 MICHELLE.
 CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE
MADE THE MERGE!
[CHEERING]
 FOOD.
 LET'S EAT.
 I'M SUPER EXCITED BECAUSE I'M
BACK WITH MICHELLE, AND I GOT
TAILS BACK.
 OH, MY GOD.
 BUT THEN I ALSO GOT IN MY
POCKET, I GOT WILL AND HANNAH,
AN I'M PRETTY SURE BRET AND
SUNDAY.
BESIDES THAT I GOT AN IDOL IN MY
BACK POCKET, SO I'M THE KINGPIN,
BUT NO ONE KNOW, AND I WANT THE
KEEP IT THAT WAY.
 DO WE WANT TO GO AROUND AND
SAY WHERE WE COME FROM, OUR AGE,
WHAT WE DO IN MY NAME IS TAYLOR,
AND I'M 24 YEARS OLD, AND I EMA
SNOWBOARD INSTRUCTOR.
 SEEING EVERYONE TOGETHER, I
HAVE NO IDEA WHO I CAN REALLY
TRUST AND WHO I CANNOT.
I STILL TRULY TRUST CHRIS AND
SUNDAY THE MOST.
 I'M SUNDAY.
I'M OLDER THAN ALL OF YOU.
 THEN I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO TRUST JAY, BUT I SAW
SOME MILLENNIALS KIND OF COMING
TOGETHER, LAUGHING, ALL JOKING
AND, YOU KNOW, IT GOT ME A
LITTLE NERVOUS.
SO I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WE'LL SEE.
 OH, MY GOD, BRET.
 WE GOT THE GET BRET AND
SUNDAY BACK OVER.
WE GET BRET AND SUNDAY, WE'RE
GOOD.
 OF COURSE, A MILLION THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.
 I HAVEN'T DECIDED IF THE
MERGE IS GOING TO BE A GOOD
THING OR A BAD THING FOR ME.
EVERYTHING WAS GOING REALLY WELL
AT VANUA.
WE WERE ON A ROLL.
BUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TWO
TRIBES AND THEN A SWAP AND NOW
WE'RE BACK INTO THIS 13 AND
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS IS EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT.
DAVE, ZEKE AND PATRIOTS ARE
MESHING PRETTY WELL.
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD CORE GROUP
RIGHT THERE TO WORK WITH, AND
THEN I WANT THE REGROUP WITH
BRET AND SUNDAY AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE NEXT MOVE IS.
 HEY, GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS ON
NONE OF US BEING VOTED OUT.
 YEAH.
 I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE MY OLD
NERDY PALS HANNAH ANDED A DAMP
IT'S ALMOST GOOD THAT WE GOT
SPLIT UP, BECAUSE I HAVE INTEL
FROM VANUA.
ADAM HAS INTEL FROM TAKALI, AND
HANNAH HAS TAPPED IN ON THE
INTEL FROM JAY ATTICKIC.
 SO I GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL AND
WRITE DOWN BRET'S NAME AND
MICHAELA WRITES DOWN BRET'S
NAME, AND THEN EVERYONE FLIPS ON
THE TWO OF US.
 REALLY?
 LED BY...
 JAY?
HAVING MY NERD VOTING BLOC, I
SHOULD BE FEELING GREAT, BUT JAY
WORRIES ME.
HE'S THE LOCUST OF POWER RIGHT
NEW BECAUSE JAY IS VERY
CHARMING.
HE LOOKS AT YOU WITH THOSE DEEP
BROWN EYES AND HE SMILES THE
SURFER SMILE, AND IT'S VERY
ENCHANTING.
AND IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS.
I SEE ALL OF THE DUDES, KEN AND
CHRIS AND TAY, EVERYONE SORT OF
GETTING TAKEN IN BY THIS JAY
CHARM.
 HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 GOOD.
 FOR REAL?
 YEAH.
 HE SORT OF HAS THIS MYSTIQUE
THAT EVERYONE IS DRAWN TOWARD.
HE CONTROLS WILL OUTRIGHT.
HE PROBABLY CONTROLS MICHELLE.
 I USED TO LIVE IN NEWPORT
BEACH.
 BEAUTIFUL, MAN.
 I'M LIKE, IF THIS BRO
ALLIANCE HAPPENS, I'M IN
TROUBLE.
 WE HAVE A BURIED CHEST OF
AWESOMENESS.
 WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE, I WAS
WORRIED THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH
FOOD.
THERE'S WAY MORE THAN I THOUGHT
THERE WOULD BE, WAY MORE.
 MY PHILOSOPHY HERE IS THAT
HAVING A MERGE FEAST, IT'S NICE,
IT'S FUN, I LIKE TO EAT, BUT DO
I NEED IT?
NO.
AND ALMOST EVERY MERGE IN
SURVIVOR, THERE'S GOING TO BE A
MERGE IDOL OUT HERE SOMEWHERE.
AND I KNOW THIS CAMP WELL.
I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S
BEEN ABLE TO FIND AN IDOL HERE.
SO IF THERE IS AN IDOL OUT HERE,
I FEEL LIKE I MAY HAVE A GOOD
CHANCE TO ACTUALLY FIND
SOMETHING.
I TAKE A WILL BE AT TREE MAIL, I
LOOK UP, AND THERE'S A NOTE.
I GRAB IT.
I OPEN IT UP, BUT THERE'S NO
IDOL.
SO I'M LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOUND AN ADVANTAGE THAT
ALLOWS YOU TO STEAL A REWARD
AFTER IT HAS BEEN WON BY SOMEONE
ELSE.
WOW.
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
GAME, AND THIS IS CERTAINLY A
FIRST.
AND IT'S EXCITING TO BE PART OF
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
TO HAVE A NEW POWER THAT NOBODY
HAS EVER HAD IN THIS GAME
BEFORE.
ALERT JEFF OF YOUR INTENTION TO
STEAL AFTER HE HAS PRESENTED THE
REWARD AND BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE
CHALLENGE AREA.
 I THINK I'M IN ONE OF THE
BEST POSITIONS IN THIS GAME AND
I HAVE AN IDOL.
SO I'M GOING TO SIT ON THIS AND
USE THIS ON SOMETHING THAT
REALLY MATTERS.
 I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT AND I GET THIS IDEA.
I'M LIKE, I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH
MASON JARS AND, YOU KNOW,
CANNING STUFF.
SO I PULL A CLASSIC SURVIVOR
MOVE.
I GRAB A MASON JAR.
I PUT SO MUCH STUFF IN THERE, I
WAS LIKE I'M GOING THE TRY THE
EAT AS MUCH OF THAT AS I
POSSIBLY CAN.
THAT'S MY STASH.
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I
HEAR CLANGING AND THE KID'S
GRABBING DRY BANANAS.
THAT'S OUR FOOD FOR THE WEEK.
THIS IS 13 PEOPLE OUT HERE.
YOU DON'T JUST JUMP IN AND START
DIVVYING UP FOOD FOR YOURSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO
SAY ANYTHING, SO I GO BACK THE
BED.
 I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT NIGHT AND I SEE TAYLOR
SNEAKING SOME FOOD, SO I DECIDED
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD
TRUST WITH HIM.
I'M GOING TO HAVE A MIDNIGHT
THROW-DOWN AND TALK SOME GAME.
 IF I TELL ANYONE ABOUT, THIS
JUST VOTE MY ASS OUT.
I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.
I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED THAT FIGGY
IS GONE, AND THAT'S TOTALLY
UNDERSTANDABLE.
 TAYLOR IS AN INCREDIBLY
UNLIKELY ALLY FOR ME.
I HAVE VOTED AGAINST HIS
GIRLFRIEND TWICE AND ACTUALLY
VOTED HER OUT, BUT IF I CAN
CONVINCE HIM TO VOTE MY WAY,
THEN I'VE GOT CONTROL OF THIS
GAME.
 JAY IS BUILDING AN ARM AND
WILL HAS BECOME JAY'S RIGHT-HAND
MAN.
THEY'RE TIGHTER HONESTLY THAN
YOU AND HIM HAVE MAYBE EVER
BEEN.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 WHAT IF WE VOTED OUT WILL?
 YOU WOULD TAKE OUT WILL?
HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK
THE YOU, NUMBER ONE.
 HOLY CRAP.
ADAM'S TRYING TO GET WILL OUT.
ARE YOU DUMB?
LIKE I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH ADAM.
HE WROTE MY WOMAN'S NAME DOWN,
BUT ADAM THINKS THAT WE ARE VERY
BUDDY BUDDY, AND I WANT TO KEEP
IT THAT WAY.
 CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET?
 WHAT'S UP?
 I'M LOOKING FOR AN IDOL
TODAY, AND I FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.
 OKAY.
 IT'S NEVER BEEN DIDN'T
BEFORE.
IT SAYS AT ANY POINT I CAN STEAL
SOMEONE'S REWARD.
 A REWARD?
 YEAH.
SO IF SOMEONE WINS A LOVED ONE,
I'M TAKING THIS REWARD.
 THAT'S HILARIOUS, DUDE.
THE ONLY REASON I'M TELLING YOU
IS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT WORKING WITH
YOU.
 YEAH.
 THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
EASIER.
I GET ALL THIS INTEL FROM ADAM,
LIKE I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING.
I AM A FAN OF THE "SURVIVOR"
REVENGE, AND SO I WANT TO
BLINDSIDE ADAM AS BEST AS
POSSIBLE.
 THAT'S EPIC, DUDE.
 THAT'S EPIC, DUDE.
 SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT.
 THE MANGOES HAD NOT BEEN
TOUCHED.
I WOKE UP, AND THERE WAS MAYBE
LIKE A QUARTER TO ONE-THIRD LEFT
IN THE DRAWER.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
 IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO
ME.
 I THINK WE'RE GETTING
BAMBOOZLED.
 THIEVES.
 I KNOW.
 I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT
WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED THE
MILLENNIALS' HOLD ON EACH OTHER
AND THEIR ACTUAL BOND.
I SEE A TIGHT GROUP OVER THERE.
SO I'M THINKING WE HAVE TO GET
ONE OF THEM GONE OR WE'RE IN
TROUBLE.
 MICHELLE?
 THINK ABOUT IT, YOU, SUNDAY,
ME.
 HE'S READY TO POUNCE.
 TAYLOR.
 MAYBE.
 THE TIGHTEST BONDS IN THIS
GAME ARE JAY AND MICHELLE AND
WILL.
 YEAH.
 I AGREE.
 THEY'RE ALSO DANGEROUS
PLAYERS.
 SO YOU GUYS ARE GOOD WITH
TAYLOR, RIGHT?
 THAT WOULD BE SWEET.
 ALL RIGHT PEOPLE ARE FLOATING
AROUND THE NAME TAYLOR.
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL ON BOARD
WITH IT.
BUT IT'S SO EARLY.
WE'RE AT A POINT IN THE GAME
WHERE EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO
CARVE OUT A PATH TO FINAL
TRIBAL.
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TON OF
SCRAMBLING.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START TO GET
UNSURE, AND THAT IS WHEN THE
GAME GETS CRAZY.
 WHAT'S UP?
 I'M THINKING TO, WHAT EXTENT
WILL YOU VOTE OUT MILLENNIALS?
 ME?
I WANT TO KEEP IT STRONG RIGHT
NOW.
BECAUSE I KNOW GEN XERS WILL
TARGET ME AND YOU.
 YEAH.
 I WANT GEN XERS TO FLIP ON
THEIR OWN SO IT'S EASY.
 YEAH.
 SO WE CAN GET ADAM THE STAY
WITH US.
WHERE DOES WILL STAND AT THIS
POINT?
 WILL'S GOOD.
HE'S WITH US.
WE'RE SO SOLID THAT GROUP, NO
ONE IS TRADING ON ANYONE.
 HOW TIGHT-LIPPED CAN YOU BE?
 SUPER.
 OKAY.
BECAUSE IF THIS GETS BACK, THEN
IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP IN OUR
FACES.
 OKAY.
 ADAM WANTS TO GUN FOR WILL.
 FOR WILL?
 FOR WILL.
DON'T TELL WILL THIS?
 ADAM WANTS THE TAKE OUT WILL
NOW?
 YES.
 HOLY CRAP, DUDE.
 I KNOW.
 I'M CHILLING.
TAILS COMES TO ME AND HE'S LIKE,
WE NEED TO TALK.
HE'S LIKE, DUDE, ADAM'S GUNNING
FOR WILL.
AND I'M LIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON?
WHY IS HE GOING FOR WILL RIGHT
NOW?
THAT'S DUMB.
 BECAUSE HE'S CONVINCED THAT
HE'S YOUR RIGHT-HAND MAN?
 THAT WILL'S YOUR RIGHT-HAND
MAN.
 SO THAT MEANS HE'S GUNNING
FOR ME.
 EVENTUALLY, YES.
AND THEN IT MAKES ME THINK,
OKAY, IS IT LESS OF A RISK TO
JUST GET HIM OUT RIGHT NOW?
 THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF
LEFT FIELD.
 I KNOW.
AND IT'S GOING TO SURPRISE HIM.
 I JUST HEARD JAY AND TAYLOR
DISCUSSING GETTING RID OF ADAM.
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD, THIS IS
NOT GOOD.
 BUT IF ADAM GETS SPOOKED,
THIS IS GOING TO BLOW UP.
 WE NEED THE GET WILL ON
BOARD.
 YEAH.
 RIGHT NOW JAY AND HIS GROUP
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS.
SO I WAS HOPING TO GET THIS NERD
ALLIANCE TOGETHER, BUT IF ADAM
GETS VOTED OUT, IT WILL THROW A
WRENCH INTO MY BEAUTIFULLY LAID
PLAN.
 IT'S GOING TO GET SO CRAZY
RIGHT NOW.
 HAVE YOU HEARD MINE?
 YEAH.
 YOU HAVE?
FROM WHO?
 ADAM.
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE'S IN
THE SAME POSITION AS HE WAS WHEN
WE LEFT THIS CAMP.
 YEAH.
 ADAM'S A RAT.
WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT.
BUT NOW I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE
IF WE CAN GET THE NUMBERS, I'M
SCREWED.
SO I'M STARTING TO THINK TO
MYSELF, I HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE BACK
TRIBAL IMMUNITY.
THANK YOU, DAVID, THANK YOU,
NICK.
TRIBAL IMMUNITY, NO MORE.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS NOW WHAT
YOU COVET.
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK, YOU
ARE SAFE AT TRIBAL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.
WITHOUT IT, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON A NARROW
PERCH.
YOUR HANDS WILL BE TETHERED TO A
BUCKET ABOVE YOU.
WHEN YOUR ARMS DROP, YOU'RE OUT
OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
PICK YOU SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IN POSITION?
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
THE BLASTING FROM THE PAST THAT
HAS BEEN UPDATEED.
A SURVIVOR CLASSIC.
USED TO DO IT WITH ONE ARM.
THAT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.
SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE IT A
LITTLE TOUGHER FOR YOU GUYS.
BOTH ARMS ABOVE YOUR HEAD.
THERE REALLY IS VERY LITTLE
WIGGLE ROOM.
IF YOUR ARMS DROP JUST A LITTLE,
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO TIP YOUR
BUCKET, AN YOU'LL BE OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.
SUNDAY IS THE FIRST TO MOVE.
SUNDAY FIRST OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
NOW YOU HAVE AN IDEA HOW
SENSITIVE IT IS.
NOT MUCH WIGGLE ROOM, RIGHT?
 NOTHING.
 Jeff: CHRIS DROPS.
CHRIS IS THE SECOND PERSON OUT
OF THE CHALLENGE.
BRET DROPS RIGHT BEHIND CHRIS.
BRET IS NOW OUT.
SURVIVOR CHALLENGES ARE MADE TO
TEST, HOW FAR CAN YOU DIG RIGHT
NOW TO STAY IN THIS.
 OH, COME ON.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: I HEAR A LOT OF
GRUNTING AND GROANING.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.
YOU'RE NOT WEAK.
IT'S BY DESIGN.
THIS WAS IMPROVED TO MAKE IT
VERY TOUGH.
 COME ON.
 Jeff: JAY HAS BEEN
STRUGGLING FOR A WHILE.
GROANING AT THE PAIN.
JAY DROPS OUT.
ZEKE FALLS OFF RIGHT BEHIND JAY.
ZEKE IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
DAVID HAS BEEN MOVING A LOT, BUT
HIS ARMS ARE STAYING STEADY.
WHERE ARE YOU FEELING IT, ADAM?
 NOWHERE, JEFF.
 Jeff: WHERE ARE YOU FEELING
IT, JESSICA?
 I'M GOOD, JEFF.
 I'LL BE HONEST WHERE I'M
FEELING IT.
NO ONE ELSE IS HONEST.
I FEEL IT IN MY ARMS AND MY BACK
AND MY FEET AND MY LEGS AND MY
TOES.
 Jeff: YOU FEEL IT IN YOU
FACE?
 I FEEL IT EVERYWHERE.
IT'S LIKE PAIN EVERYWHERE.
 Jeff: KEN, THE SLIGHTEST
BIT OF MOVEMENT AND HIS BUCKET
DROPS.
THAT'S HOW FAST IT GOES.
 MY ARMS ARE GOING NUMB.
 Jeff: YOU START DAYDREAMING
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU'RE
DRENCHED.
HANNAH CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
HER BUCKET DROPS.
HANNAH NOW WILL TAKE A SPOT ON
THE BENCH.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
WE'RE DOWN TO TAYLOR, ADAM,
DAVID, JESSICA, MICHELLE, AND
WILL.
EVERYBODY TRYING TO PUT ON A BIG
GAME FACE.
YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HURTING, BUT YOU'RE
CLOSE TO FALLING, BECAUSE THEY
MIGHT JUST BE A LITTLE CLOSER.
SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN THAT
TANK, YOU NEED IT NOW.
 OH, MICHELLE.
 Jeff: MICHELLE IS OUT OF
THE CHALLENGE.
AND WE ARE NOW DOWN TO FIVE.
THIS IS ABOUT PROVING TO
YOURSELF WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN
PUSHED.
TAYLOR IS NOW OUT, AND WE ARE
DOWN TO FOUR LEFT.
DAVID CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER.
AND THAT LEAVES US WITH THREE.
ADAM DROPS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO NOW.
JESSICA AND WILL.
ONE GEN XER, ONE MILLENNIAL,
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.
 HOW YOU FEELING, JESSICA?
 I'M FEELING FINE.
HOW ARE YOU, WILL?
 I'M DOING AMAZING.
 Jeff: IT WOULD BE SO NICE
THE GO THE TRIBAL WITH THAT
NECKLACE, CERTAIN THAT YOU
AREN'T GOING HOME.
NECKLACE, CERTAIN THAT YOU
AREN'T GOING HOME.
YOU'VE REACHED THE ONE-HOUR
MARK.
 WOW.
 NICE WORK.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 Jeff: JESSICA, WHAT WOULD
YOUR KIDS SAY RIGHT NOW?
 MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE DAMN
PROUD OF THEIR MOM.
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THEM THEY CAN
DO ANYTHING, ANYTHING.
 MY MOM TOLD ME THE SAME
THING.
 YOU HAVE A GOOD MOM.
 YEAH.
NOW I'M HERE HERE TO PROVE IT.
NOW I'M HERE HERE TO PROVE IT.
 THIS IS CRAZY.
 INSANE.
 IT'S INCREDIBLE.
 Jeff: CAN'T BE MUCH FEELING
LEFT IN YOUR ARMS, HANDS,
FINGERS, AND EVERY TIME YOU TRY
TO LOOSEN THEM OR GET SOME
FEELING BACK, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
RISKING TIPPING THAT BUCKET.
YOU GOT TO DO IT TO GET THE
FEELING BACK.
 MY LEGS ARE GOING.
 SHE'S MOVING.
 WHOA.
 Jeff: AFTER AN HOUR AND 30
MINUTES, JESSICA DROPS.
WILL, THE HIGH SCHOOLER, WINS
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 YEAH, WILLIE.
 NICE JOB.
 Jeff: WOW.
WHAT A PERFORMANCE.
 I KNEW I NEEDED IT, SO I JUST
KEPT PUSHING FOR IT.
 Jeff: WILL, COME ON OVER.
 NICE JOB, WILL.
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY GOES
TO WILL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR FRIENDS
BACK HOME IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE
DOING RIGHT NOW, BUT IT
DEFINITELY ISN'T THIS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 23
DAYS, YOUR QUEST FOR $1 MILLION
FOR ONE OF YOU WILL FALL SHORT.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
GOOD JOB.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 MY PLAN TOTALLY JUST BLEW UP
IN MY FACE, AND I GOT TO GIVE
HIM CREDIT.
WILL NEEDED TO WIN TODAY, AND HE
DID.
AND SO NOW I NEED TO TRY TO
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER PLAN.
 WOW, YOU WERE UNBELIEVABLE,
MAN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID THAT.
 INCREDIBLE.
 THAT WAS AMAZING TO WATCH.
 NICE JOB.
 THANK YOU.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I, THE
YOUNGEST PERSON TO EVER PLAY
THIS GAME WON THE FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
AND WHAT MAKES IT EVEN BETTER IS
THAT I NEEDED THIS ONE.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ADAM HAD
PLANNED TO TRY TO VOTE ME OUT OF
THIS GAME.
SO HE HAS TO GO.
 HE WAS GUNNING FOR WILL.
 JAY?
 HE HAS THE NUMBERS.
THINK ABOUT IT.
 ARE YOU STILL WITH HIM?
 WHATEVER YOU WANT?
 WE GET BACK AND ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY, JAY TURNS AROUND
AND SAYS, WE'RE VOTING ADAM OUT
TONIGHT.
AND MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS,
WHAT?
THAT'S STUPID.
WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO WOULD BE GREAT TO GO HOME.
IT SEEMS LIKE MORE THAN A
PERSONAL MOVE THAN A STRATEGIC
MOVE, AND I'M REALLY WORRIED
WE'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.
 HEY, I GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU,
BEFORE WE WENT TO THE CHALLENGE,
TAYLOR TOLD JAY THAT YOU HAD
BEEN PLANNING TO VOTE OUT WILL.
 THAT'S WHY WILL KNEW.
 YEAH.
 WILL SAID, I KNOW I'M A
TARGET.
I KNEW IT.
AS SOON AS HE WAS UP THERE FOR,
LIKE, THREE HOURS, I WAS LIKE,
THE KID KNOWS.
WHAT WENT WRONG?
 I LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A SOLID PLAN,
AND THEN THE DAY OF TRIBAL
COUNCIL, IT ALL UNRAVELED.
SO YOU'RE NOW JAY'S TARGET.
BUT I THINK WE CAN PULL THE
VOTES TOGETHER TO GET OUT
TAYLOR.
 TAYLOR.
 I HAD A FEELING I MIGHT BE
PLAYING TOO HARD.
I WAS PLAYING TOO HARD.
NOW I HAVE TO SCRAMBLE.
AND AT THIS POINT I'M WILLING TO
WORK WITH ANYBODY ON THIS TRIBE
IF IT WILL KEEP ME IN THIS GAME.
 I'M SORRY I'M COMING TO YOU
RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WHATEVER NAME YOU WANT, I'M
PUTTING DOWN.
 I'M A LITTLE WORRIED HE HAS
AN IDOL.
HE COULD GIVE IT TO TAYLOR.
 RIGHT.
 WHAT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN UP IS
THE UPPER ECHELON OF THE
MILLENNIALS.
THAT'S JAY, MICHELLE, AND
TAYLOR.
IT IS JUST A QUESTION OF GETTING
EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE,
BECAUSE IN THE BACK OF OUR
MINDS, WE'RE THINKING, WELL,
THERE ARE IDOLS OUT THERE,
RIGHT?
HERE'S WHAT I THINK: MICHELLE IS
THE SAFEST PERSON TO GO AFTER
BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT HAVE AN
IDOL AND THEY WON'T SEE IT
COMING.
 SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T HAVE
ONE.
 EXACTLY.
 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT?
 WE HAVE THE MAKE A DECISION,
GUYS.
 I NEED THE GEN XERS TO GET
THROUGH THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT
THEY'RE BACK AND FORTH ON WHO TO
VOTE FOR, AND IF THEY CAN'T GET
IT TOGETHER, THEN I NEED MY PLAN
"B," WHICH IS TO SEE IF I CAN
GET TAYLOR TO TARGET SOMEBODY
ELSE.
 JAY WON'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE.
IT WAS TOO SOON, AND I HAD AN
INFORMATION LEAK.
 SO WHAT DO I DO?
 I'M WITH YOU.
 AT THIS POINT ADAM HAS A GOOD
IDEA THAT HIS NAME HAS BEEN
DROPPED, SO HE'S SCRAMBLING.
BUT IT'S TOO LATE, MAN.
 I WILL WRITE ANYONE'S NAME
DOWN AT THIS POINT.
 TONIGHT IS 100% ABOUT
REVENGE.
ADAM'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FIGGY
GOING HOME.
SO NOW WE'RE IN THE MERGE, AND I
GOT MY BOYS BACK, AND WE'RE
COMING TO BEAT YOU UP.
 HERE'S THE SCENARIO: HE HAS
AN IDOL...
 HE DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL.
HE'S SCRAMBLING FOR ONE.
 IT'S SO ODD.
IT'S LIKE ALL THESE...
 THESE CONVERSATIONS.
 WHEN ADAM WALKS OFF WITH
TAYLOR...
 YOU DON'T THINK ADAM WOULD
FLIP ON US, DO YOU?
WE WERE GOING TO TALK TO ADAM.
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TRUST
HIM.
THEN PARANOIA SETS IN AND PANIC.
THAT LITTLE SEED OF DOUBT CAN
GROW INTO A GIGANTIC FOREST OF
DOUBT.
 I'M NERVOUS.
DON'T FREAK OUT TOO MUCH.
THE VOTE WILL GET SCREWED UP,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 OKAY.
 I TRUST YOU.
I DON'T TRUST THEM.
 I WILL CHECK IN WITH THOSE
PEOPLE, BUT IF YOU KEEP PULLING
ME ASIDE, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO
GET ME IN TROUBLE.
 ADAM'S NAME IS BEING THROWN
OUT THERE HARD CORE.
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
BECAUSE ADAM DECIDED HE COULDN'T
JUST PLAY THE WITH THE WEIRDOES.
HE HAD TO SIT AT THE COOL KIDS
TABLE.
 ADAM NEEDS TO GO VERY SOON.
ADAM IS UNTRUSTWORTHY.
ADAM IS A BAD ALLIANCE MEMBER.
 I HAD BEEN HOPING TO PRESERVE
MY NERD VOTING BLOC, BUT ADAM IS
THE MOST FRUSTRATING PERSON TO
WORK.
WITH I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S UP.
TO NOW I'M THINKING I SHOULD
JUST VOTE HIM OUT.
 HANNAH IS TELLING ME I JUST
NEED TO RELAX AND THAT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY.
BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT MY
POSITION IN THIS GAME IS VERY
TENUOUS.
 I'M JUST HAPPY.
 THE GOOD NEWS IS I HAVE THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
SO I COULD PLAY IT, AND I'LL
KNOW I'M STILL GOING TO BE HERE
TOMORROW.
BUT IF I USE IT AND I HAVE THE
NUMBERS, I LOOK LIKE A CHUMP.
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 Jeff: SO THE MILLENNIALS
AND GEN X TOGETHER, THIS IS WHAT
YOU WAIT FOR.
DAVID, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
DIFFERENCES YOU NOTICED BETWEEN
THE MILLS MILL AND THE GEN XERS?
 I THINK THE MILLENNIALS EAT
ALLOWED MORE FOOD THAN THE GEN
XERS.
OUR FEAST FOOD HAS BEEN WIPED
OUT, PINEAPPLES AND MELONS AND
THAT'S IT.
 Jeff: HE'S CLEARLY SAYING
THE GEN XERS DIDN'T EAT IT.
 IT WAS TAYLOR.
[LAUGHTER]
 BUT REALLY I WASN'T KEEPING
IT A SECRET.
 HE WASN'T KEEPING IT A
SECRET.
 YOU WERE OPEN?
 I DON'T THINK I WAS STEALING.
MY STOMACH WAS SUPER MESSED UP.
 Jeff: LET ME THIS A QUICK
POLL.
CHRIS, HOW HUNGRY ARE YOU?
 HUNGRY.
 Jeff: JESSICA, HUNGRY?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: HANNAH?
 I COULD EAT YOU.
 Jeff: SO TAYLOR, CLEARLY
THE POINT IS EVERYONE'S HUNGRY.
 OH, YEAH.
OH, DEFINITELY.
 Jeff: CHRIS, IS THIS A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
MILLENNIALS AND GEN X.
EVEN WHEN IT'S CLEAR EVERYONE IS
CALLING HIM OUT, HE'S STILL
SMILING, GOING, I KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF COOL.
 WHERE I'M FROM, WHEN YOU DO
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE THINKING
OF YOU'RE, IT'S CALLED
SELFISHNESS.
THAT'S A SELFISH MOVE.
LET'S NOT GET THAT CONFUSED WITH
GAME PLAY.
 IT'S NOT THEY WAS HUNGRY.
IF I WAKE UP AND MY STOMACH IS
FREAKING OUT, THEN, YES, I'M
GOING TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO
DO GEORGE BUSH.
 Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING THIS
WAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY?
 EXACTLY, JEFF.
 JEFF, WE ALL HAD MEDICAL
EMERGENCIES THAT NIGHT.
SOME OF US ARE STILL HAVING
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES.
WHERE ARE OUR BANANA CHIPS TO
HELP STOP US?
I MEAN, IN A GAME FOR $1
MILLION, YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE A
LITTLE DELAYED GRATIFICATION
BECAUSE IT MIGHT COST YOU $1
MILLION DOWN THE LINE.
 Jeff: AND YET, HAND
NARCOTIC I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
ASK TAYLOR, I CAN TELL BY HIS
DEMEANOR HE'S NOT THE LEAST BIT
CONCERNED THAT HE'S ON THE BLOCK
TONIGHT.
 HE'S A BRO.
 ROCK ON, DUDE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO ADAM, WHAT IS THE VIBE WITH A
GROUP OF MILLENNIALS AND GEN
XERS, THE MAJORITY OF
MILLENNIALS, BUT YOU'RE ALL
PLAYING THIS INDIVIDUAL GAME.
 IT'S NOT JUST A MAJORITY OF
MILLENNIALS.
YEAH, THERE MAY BE SOME
LOYALTIES FROM THOSE FIRST 12
DAYS, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A
PERIOD WHERE WE WERE IN THREE
DIFFERENT TRIBES GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER REALLY WELL.
AND YOU CAN BUILD LOYALTY DURING
THAT TIME, AS WELL.
 Jeff: DAVID, ADAM BRINGS UP
AN INTERESTING POINT.
WHEN YOU SWITCH TRIBES, IT
FORCES NEW RELATIONSHIPS, AND
THEN IT MAKES YOU QUESTION THE
OLD ONES.
HOW MUCH IMPACT OF HAVE THE
SWITCHES HAD?
 I MEAN, THE PHASE OF THE GAME
THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW, IT'S
SIMILARLY THIS: IT'S THE PEOPLE
I TRUST VERSUS THE PEOPLE YOU
TRUST.
AND SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHETHER YOU'RE A MILLENNIAL OR A
GEN XER, THAT'S JUST SECONDARY
TO REALLY WHO DO YOU TRUST.
 Jeff: JAY, DOES THAT RING
TRUE TO YOU, THAT IT REALLY
ISN'T MILLENNIALS VERSUS GEN X?
 I HAD TRIBAL WITH WILL.
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE THAT'S LIL
OR TRUSTWORTHY, YOU LATCH ON TO
THAT.
SO I'M GOING TO STICK BY THAT.
 Jeff: BUT MICHELLE, THAT'S
WHAT EVERY PERSON WHO HAS HAD
THE TORCH SNUFFED THOUGHT OR
SAID RIGHT BEFORE THEY GOT IT
SNUFFED.
MICHAELA JUST DID IT.
FIGGY NEVER SAW IT COMING.
THE LIST WILL GO ON AND ON.
 I'M GOING TO AGREE WITH JAY
AND WILL.
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF IT'S THE
PERSON YOU MESH WITH BEST,
SOMEONE YOU FEEL MORE FRIENDLY
WITH.
 Jeff: SO WILL, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE ON TONIGHT'S VOTE?
IS IT GOING TO BE ABOUT A VERY
CLEAR OBJECTIVE, OR IS IT
SOMETHING ELSE?
 THERE IS DEFINITELY A CLEAR
OBJECTIVE IN EVERYBODY'S MIND.
THE QUESTION IS: WHAT IS THE
PREVAILING OBJECTIVE?
 Jeff: CHRIS, HOW MANY
OBJECTIVES DO YOU THINK ARE OUT
THERE?
 WELL, I'D SAY THERE'S
PROBABLY 13, BUT I THINK THERE
WILL BE SOME LINES DRAWN IN THE
SAND TONIGHT.
THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT.
 Jeff: MICHELLE, YOU WERE
NODDING YOUR HEAD.
 I DEFINITELY SEE A LINE DRAWN
TONIGHT.
THAT MEANS THAT TRUST WILL BE
BROKEN FOR SOME PEOPLE, AND
STRENGTHENED WITH OTHERS.
 Jeff: SO TAYLOR, STILL NOT
WORRIED ABOUT TONIGHT'S VOTE?
 NO, NO, I DON'T THINK WORRY
DOES ANYTHING.
SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ALL THE
TIME.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO AT
THIS POINT TO CHANGE THE FATE OF
THAT.
 Jeff: WHY ARE YOU SMILING,
ADAM?
HE LOOKS RIGHT AT ME WHEN HE
SAID IT.
DOES THAT SAY SOMETHING?
 Jeff: HOW NERVOUS ARE YOU
RIGHT NOW?
 VERY.
 Jeff: BECAUSE YOU HEARD
YOUR NAME?
 YEAH, AND IT'S TERRIFYING.
NOBODY WANTS TO BE FIRST PERSON
VOTED OUT AT THE MERGE.
THIS IS A BIG MILESTONE.
TO MAKE IT HERE IS AN INCREDIBLE
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
BUT THIS IS WHERE THE FUN
BEGINS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
TIME TO VOTE.
DAVID, YOU'RE UP.
DAVID, YOU'RE UP.
 THIS ONE'S FOR FIG.
 THIS ONE'S FOR FIG.
 I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
TRUST YOU.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, ADAM.
MICHELLE.
ADAM.
MICHELLE.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES MICHELLE,
TWO VOTES ADAM.
ADAM.
THAT'S THREE VOTES ADAM.
MICHELLE.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
THREE VOTES MICHELLE.
THREE VOTES ADAM.
ADAM.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES ADAM.
MICHELLE.
TIED AGAIN.
FOUR VOTES MICHELLE, FOUR VOTES
ADAM.
MICHELLE.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES MICHELLE, FOUR
VOTES ADAM.
MICHELLE.
THAT'S SIX VOTES MICHELLE.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
MICHELLE.
SEVEN.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
MICHELLE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, ANY TIME THERE ARE LINES
DRAWN IN THE SAND, THE QUESTION
IS: WILL THEY BE THERE IN THE
MORNING OR WILL THE TIDE WASH
THEM AWAY?
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE BATTLE LINES
HAVE BEEN DRAWN.
 YOU AND WILL AND TAYLOR ARE
ALL ON THE BOTTOM.
THEY'RE GUNNING MY WAY.
 BUT TAYLOR CAN'T KEEP A
SECRET.
 I'M NOT GOING THE LEAK THAT
TO ANYONE.
 HE CAN STEAL SOMEONE'S
REWARD.
 I'LL PUT A MASSIVE TARGET ON
MISBACK.
 DUDE, THAT WILL RUIN HIS
GAME.
 OH, MAN, I THINK THEY DIDN'T
TRUST ME OR JAY OR A GROUP OF
US, AND I THOUGHT THAT THE
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WERE WITH US.
I THOUGHT I COULD LAY BACK AND
TRUST WHAT PEOPLE HAD SAID, SO I
MAYBE WENT OVERBOARD WITH MY
LAYING BACK.
