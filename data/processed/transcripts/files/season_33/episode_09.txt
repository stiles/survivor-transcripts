 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE OLD GEN X
TRIBE, IT WAS CHRIS, BRET AND
SUNDAY.
 I DON'T TRUST HIM AS FAR AS I
CAN THROW HIM.
 Jeff: AGAINST DAVID, KEN
AND JESSICA.
 SUNDAY, CHRIS AND BRET DON'T
TRUST YOU.
 Jeff: BUT AFTER THE MERGE,
THE GEN XERS PUT THEIR
DIFFERENCES ASIDE.
 THE UPPER ECHELON OF THE
MILLENNIALS NEED TO BE BROKEN
UP.
 Jeff: FORMING A MAJORITY
ALLIANCE WITH HANNAH, ZEKE AND
ADAM.








 MICHELLE IS THE PERSON TO GO
AFTER.
 Jeff: BUT ADAM AND TAYLOR
BEGAN SHARING SECRETS.
 I CAN STEAL SOMEONE'S REWARD.
DO NOT TELL ANYONE.
 Jeff: AND THE ALLIANCE
STARTED TO QUESTION ADAM'S
LOYALTY.
 YOU DON'T THINK ADAM WOULD
FLIP ON US, DO YOU?
 ADAM COULDN'T JUST PLAY WITH
THE WEIRDOES.
HE HAD TO SIT AT THE COOL KIDS'
TABLE.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE MAJORITY DECIDED TO TRUST
ADAM.
MICHELLE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
HEAVING TAYLOR, JAY AND WILL OUT
OF THE LOOP.
12 ARE LEFT.








WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 I JUST LOST ONE OF MY MOST
TRUSTWORTHY AND LOYAL PEOPLE,
AND NOW I GUESS THE BIG GEN X
CESSPOOL OVER THERE IS GUNNING
FOR THE MILLENNIALS.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 AND EVEN THE MILLENNIAL
FLIPPERS DON'T EVEN KNOW BECAUSE
THEY'RE SO STUPID, LIKE ZEKE AND
ADAM AND HANNAH.
OH, YEAH, YOU THREE ARE REALLY
GOING TO MATCH UP TO THE OTHER
SIX THAT ARE COMING FOR YOU.
FREAKING IDIOTS.
 I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THE VOTES
COME DOWN THE WAY THEY DID,
BECAUSE THAT MEANS I'M GAINING
SOME TRACTION AND SOME CONTROL
IN THIS MAJORITY GROUP.
I FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH
THE SOLID PEOPLE IN OUR GROUP,
BUT PEOPLE LIKE ADAM WHO WERE
MAYBE FLOATING IN BETWEEN AND
REALLY HOST ON WHERE THEY NEEDED
TO GO, IT JUST SCARES ME.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
 HOW YOU DOING?
STICK AROUND.
 HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN?
 YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY HAVE SO
MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST IN
THIS GAME, AND WHEN THEY'RE
GONE, IT SUCKS, BRO.
 BUT THEY TRUSTED ADAM.
 ME AND JAY HAVE TO WORK OUR
WAY SOMEHOW INTO THE ALLIANCE
THAT WAS SOLID TONIGHT.
SO HOW MANY ARE THERE LEFT?
 OF US, THREE.
 I HAVE TO PULLED A DAM ASIDE
AND MAKE SURE WE'RE STILL ON
GOOD TERMS AS FAR AS LEGAL
WARFARE, BECAUSE ADAM COULD
POSSIBLY SPILL THE BEANS THAT I
BURIED TWO THINGS OF FOOD.
I KNOW TONIGHT DIDN'T WORK OUT
HOW WE WANTED IT TO.
 I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DECIDED
THAT WORKING WITH ME WASN'T IN
YOUR BEST INTEREST, AND THAT'S
TOTALLY FINE.
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL, JAY
AND TAYLOR BLEW UP MY SPOT, AND
THEN THEY GUNNED FUR ME, AND
WHEN THEY GUNNED FOR ME, ALL
BETS WERE OFF.
EVEN IF I AM AT THE BOTTOM OF
GEN X, IT CERTAINLY FEELS BETTER
THAN BEING OUT OF THE GAME,
WHICH IS WHERE YOU TRIED TO PUT
ME.
 AS FAR AS LIKE ME KNOWING
THAT YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN
THE GAME, THAT'S STILL... LIKE I
RESPECT THAT, AS LONG AS YOU
RESPECT ME.
 AND I HAVE A SECRET OF YOUR,
AS WELL, ANDLY KEEP THAT, AS
WELL.
 YEAH, OKAY.
ROCK ON, DUDE.
 I FEEL LIKE I HOLD A BIGGER
SECRET OF ADAM'S THAN HE HOLDS
OF MINE.
 GOOD NIGHT, DUDE.
 AND I'M GOING, YOU RAT ME OUT
ABOUT MY FOOD STASH, THEN, YOU
KNOW, I'M GOING TO RAT YOU OUT
ABOUT YOU ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.
 THIS IS MY BEST IDEA EVER,
STEALING FOOD.
I'M SO SNEAKY THAT I STOLE LIKE
HALF OF THE FOOD.
OH, YEAH.
AND NO ONE EVEN NOTICED.
MY PRETZELS ARE GETTING A LITTLE
BIT SOGGY FROM ALL THE FRUIT IN
THERE, SO I'M TRYING TO EAT THE
PRETZELS FIRST.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A DATE MAYBE.
THAT'S A PEACH.
I STILL HAVE A WHOLE OTHER MASON
JAR.
I'M NOT EVEN HALF-WAY WITH THIS
ONE.
THE ONLY PERSON THAT KNOWS IS
ADAM, BUT I HAVE MORE LEVERAGE
ON HIM THAN HE HAS ON ME, SO
THIS WOW, OUT -- THIS WORKS OUT
GREAT.
 RIGHT THERE.
 THE SHADE?
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD.
 LAST NIGHT I GOT BLIND SIDED.
SO NOW IN MY HEAD IT'S LIKE,
DUDE, JAY, YOU MIGHT BE NEXT,
DUDE.
SO TRY TO FIND YOU WAY OUT OF
THIS HOLE, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I
HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL IN MY BACK
POCKET, I'M IN TROUBLE.
 THERE WAS A LOT OF FEELING OF
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE ME
SOMEWHERE AND NOT PLAY WITH ME.
I FELT LIKE THE WAY I HAVE BEEN
PLAYING IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE TURNED ME
INTO A PRETTY DECENT GOAT, AND
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO BE.
I WASN'T SURE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
IT, SO I DECIDED TO PLAY
INDEPENDENTLY LAST NIGHT.
 I WAS SCHOOLED.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
YOU DID GOOD.
 I'VE TAKEN MY GAME INTO MY
OWN HAND, AND I WANT TO DO IT
WELL.
I WANT TO DO IT JUSTICE.
I'VE LOVED THE SHOW SINCE I WAS
14.
I'M COMING OUT HERE AND I'M
PLAYING WITH THE INTENTION OF
TRYING THE WIN AND IT'S SO FUN.
 DAMN, HOMIE DIDN'T TELL ME.
 I KNOW, BUT I COULDN'T STICK
WITH YOU THIS TIME.
 WELL, INCLUDE ME ON THE NEXT
ONE, PLEASE.
 YEAH.
I'M FINALLY GETTING TO PLAY.
AND LAST NIGHT I REALIZED THAT I
COULD DO IT.
AND IT'S ADDICTING.
LIKE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PULL
OFF ANOTHER VOTE.
AND NOW I FINALLY GET THE CHANCE
TO MAKE SOME MOVES.
 HIGH-FIVE.
I DON'T WANT A HE FIVE.
HIGH-FIVE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS OF SIX.
ON MY GO, YOU'LL RACE THROUGH A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES, ATTEMPTING
TO RETRIEVE A KEY.
YOU'LL USE THE KEY TO UNLOCK A
BOX.
YOU'LL THEN DRAG THE BOX
UNDERNEATH A NET TO THE FINISH.
YOU'LL OPEN THE BOX, RETRIEVE
THE BOLOS INSIDE ATTEMPTING TO
LAND THEM ON THE TARGET.
FIRST TEAM THE LAND THEIR BOLOS
WINS REWARD.
THE WINNING TEAM WILL BE TAKEN
TO A RESORT WHERE YOU WILL
LOUNGE POOLSIDE WHILE DINING ON
CHEESEBURGERS, FRIES AND
COCKTAILS.
 OH, CHEESEBURGERS.
 FRIES.
 NOW WE'RE TALKING.
 Jeff: AND SOFT DRINKS.
SO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING,
WE'LL THIS A SCHOOLYARD PICK.
WE'LL PICK FOR CAPTAINS.
AND THEN WHO DO YOU CHOOSE?
MEMBERS OF YOUR ALLIANCE OR THE
PEOPLE WHO WILL HELP YOU WIN
FOOD.
WE'LL DRAW FOR CAPTAINS.
LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE RANDOMLY CHOSE FOR
CAPTAINS.
CHRIS WAS A CAPTAIN AND PICKED
BRET, KEN, DAVID, SUNDAY AND
TAYLOR.
HANNAH WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE CHOSE ADAM, WILL, ZEKE AND
JAY AND JESSICA.
LET'S SEE WHO MADE THE BETTER
CHOICE.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
OVER AND UNDER.
KEN TAKES A BIG FALL, BUT IT
DOESN'T SLOW HIM DOWN.
ONCE YOU GET EVERYBODY TO THE
MAT, YOU CAN START WORKING ON
THAT KEY.
 GO, GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: GO, PURPLE.
GO, ORANGE.
DAVID BEING HOISTED UP.
AND DEMAND IS GOING UP.
 COME ON, ORANGE.
 COME ON, GUYS.
 Jeff: DAVID WORKING QUICKLY
FOR PURPLE.
HE'S GOT IT.
UNLOCK THAT BOX.
ADAM NEEDS TO GET THOSE KNOTS
UNDONE.
HE CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE.
 COME ON.
 Jeff: A QUICK EARLY LEAD
FOR PURPLE.
THEY HAVE THE BOX UNLOCKED.
LET'S GO, UNDER THE NET NOW.
ORANGE STILL WORKING ON THOSE
KNOTS AFGHANISTAN.
GIGANTIC SETBACK EARLY INTO THIS
CHALLENGE.
NOW WE'VE GOT IT.
UNLOCK THE BOX.
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE TOUGHEST
PART.
 COME ON.
PUSH, GUYS!
 Jeff: YOU HAVE FOUR BODIES
AND A HEAVY, BIG BECOMES YOU
HAVE TO GET UNDER IT.
ORANGE HAS THEIR BOX UNLOCKED.
LET'S GO, ORANGE.
YOU HAVE TO CATCH UP.
 MOVE THE DIRT, MOVE THE DIRT.
 Jeff: WHICH FOURSOME CAN
GET THROUGH HERE THE QUICKEST?
YOU WILL GIVE A BIG LEADED TO
BOLO THROWERS.
 GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: GREAT TEAMWORK BY
PURPLE.
 YOU WATCH THE NET.
PULL.
 Jeff: ORANGE MAKING VERY
LITTLE PROGRESS.
 THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME
PUSHING IT THROUGH THE THING.
CLEARLY CHRIS MADE THE BETTER
CHOICE WITH TRIBE MEMBERS.
PURPLE OUT OF THE NET.
 DO IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THREE PEOPLE ON THE MAT.
ONE PERSON USING THE MACHETE.
IT'S GOING TO BE KEN NOW
CHOPPING THE ROPE.
THAT WILL RELEASE THE BLOCKS.
 THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.
 Jeff: ORANGE STILL IN THE
NETTING.
 GUYS, DO A ONE, TWO, THREE,
PULL.
 ONE, TWO, THREE...
 WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
 Jeff: KEN IS THROUGH TWO.
KEN IS THROUGH ALL THREE.
PULL THE ROPES OUT.
 PULL THE ROPES OUT.
 Jeff: NOW TAYLOR AND SUNDAY
TAKING OVER.
 COME ON, GUYS.
THEY HAVE FIVE BOLOS.
NOW YOU HAVE TO HIT THE TARGET.
THIS IS A MASSIVE BLOWOUT RIGHT
NOW.
ORANGE IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO BEING
THROUGH.
TAYLOR GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
TAYLOR HOOKS THE FIRST BOLO.
 KEEP GOING, TAYLOR.
 TAYLOR, KEEP GOING, BUD.
 Jeff: TAYLOR HOOKS THE
SECOND BOLO.
 GUYS, DON'T GIVE UP.
 Jeff: TAYLOR WITH THREE
BOLOS.
THEY ARE TWO AWAY.
IT WOULD BE FIRST BLOWOUT THIS
SEASON.
THERE'S FOUR.
WILL, ADAM AND JAY CONTINUE TO
FIGHT TO GET BACK IN THIS.
IS IT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: TAYLOR HOOKS IT.
REWARD FOR CHRIS, KEN, BRET,
DAVID, SUNDAY AND TAYLOR!
DRINKS, FOOD, POOLSIDE.
WHAT A BLOWOUT.
CHRIS, CLEARLY YOU CHOSE WISELY.
NICE JOB.
HUGE REWARD.
YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO A BEAUTIFUL
RESORT.
CHEESEBURGERS, FRIES, COCKTAILS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY
THE AFTERNOON.
 THANK YOU.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
ADAM, ZEKE, JAY, HANNAH, WILL,
JESSICA, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 I WAS ON SUCH A HIGH FOR
PULLING OFF MY FIRST BLINDSIDE
VOTE, AND I KNEW I WANTED TO
KEEP JAY AND WILL CLOSER TO ME,
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY FEEL ON THE
BOTTOM, BUT I PICKED A HORRIBLE
TEAM, AND THE MAKE SUCH A
GLARING MISTAKE, IT TAKES YOU
BACK A STEP, BUT IF I WANT TO
STAY IN THE GAME, I HAVE THE
PROVE THAT I CAN HANDLE THIS.
 OH.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
 OH, GUYS, LOOK AT THIS
SPREAD.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?
 DRINKS.
ORANGES.
 CHICKEN, DIEWSMED.
 WE WALK IN AND MY SENSES WERE
JUST OVERLOADED.
THE AMOUNT OF FOOD PACKED ON
THAT TABLE, IT WAS CRAZY.
 BURGER.
LUCKILY MY BODY HAS BEEN A
LITTLE BIT MORE ADAPTED TO FOOD
THAN THESE OTHER GUYS BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN SNEAKING FOOD, SO I'M
A LOT MORE CAPABLE OF DRINKING
MORE, EATING MORE.
THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE.
I COULD WIN NEXT CHALLENGE FROM
THAT.
 GUYS, SOME COCKTAILS ARE
COMING.
 HERE HE COMES.
 GOING INTO THE REWARD, I
SAID, THERE ARE GOING TO BE
DRINKS, TAKE IT A LITTLE EASY,
DON'T GO CRAZY.
YES, SIR, RIGHT HERE.
BUT COME ON NOW, THERE'S A POOL
LOOKING OUT AT THE OCEAN,
THERE'S FOOD.
AT LEAST MY BELLY BEEN FULL, SO
I CAN HAVE MORE DRINKS.
KEEP THESE COMING UNTIL I DROP,
WILL YOU?
SO I JUST WENT ALL OUT.
I WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO DRINK
AS MUCH AS I CAN WHILE I'M HERE.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
IF YOU CLIMB THAT BEAN STOCK,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS FACE
RIGHT HERE.
 MY MAN BRET STARTED KNOCKING
BACK THE DRINKS.
HE WAS ALL IN, MAN.
HE HAD PROBABLY, I DON'T KNOW,
EIGHT OR NINE DRINKS.
 CANNONBALL.
 HE WAS LETTING LOOSE, BUT
THAT'S JUST BRET.
HE'S A BIG, LOUD GUY.
 IF I RUN OUT TO THE OCEAN AND
GET FRESH FISH, CAN YOU MIX IT
INTO A DRINK?
 IT'S KIND OF AN ODD GROUP
THAT WE HAVE GOING ON HERE.
I MEAN, FOR A SOLID ALLIANCE,
WE'VE GOT CHRIS, BRET, MYSELF,
BUT WE DON'T 100% TRUST DAVID,
KEN OR JESSICA.
 GOOD AS NEW SUNDAY,?
 GOOD AS NEW.
WE'RE JUST FRACTURED AS GEN XERS
BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THE
GEN X TRIBE, SO MOVING FORWARD
WHAT I WANT TO MAKE IS A
PROACTIVE MOVE, BECAUSE I
DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I NEED TO
TAKE CONTROL OF THE GAME.
 THAT WAS A GRITTY CHALLENGE
FOR SURE.
 DUDE, THAT WAS HELL.
 RIGHT NOW I'M ON A LOSING
STREAK, MICHELLE GOES HOME FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I JUST LOST
REWARD.
I TRY TO REGROUP MYSELF, AND I'M
THINKING, THE GEN XERS ARE GONE.
I'LL TALK THE ADAM.
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING
HAPPEN.
I KNOW YOU HAVE NUMBERS
OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE I GOT BLIND
SIDED.
I KNEW THEY WAS SCREWED, THAT I
GOT CAUGHT, AND THAT IT WAS
GOING TO BE MY NAME WAS GOING
THE COME UP.
AND SO AT THAT POINT, I WOULD
HAVE WRITTEN YOUR NAME DOWN.
IT WAS EITHER BE AT THE BOTTOM
OF GEN X, AS YOU LIKE THE CALL
IT, OR GO HOME.
SO THERE WAS NO CHOICE.
 I'M WORRIED THAT I MIGHT BE
PLAYING TOO AGGRESSIVELY, THAT I
MIGHT BE PLAYING TOO HARD, BUT I
HAVE TO PROVE MY LOYALTY TO MY
ALLIANCE, BECAUSE I HAVE A MUCH
STRONGER BOND WITH GEN X THAN I
CERTAINLY EVER WILL WITH JAY AT
THIS POINT.
 TAYLOR IS THE REASON THAT YOU
AND WILL AND TAYLOR ARE ALL ON
THE BOTTOM AND THAT MICHELLE IS
OUT OF THE GAME, BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, HE...
 SO I AM ON THE BOTTOM?
 OF COURSE.
YOU KNOW FROM THE VOTE LAST
NIGHT YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.
 I TALKED TO ADAM, AND ADAM
WAS JUST A HUGE JERK.
HE'S BASICALLY LIKE THROWING IT
IN MY FACE THAT I'M ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE LINE AND BASICALLY
SAYING, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
ON THE BOTTOM, JAY.
SO WHAT IS IT, THE GEN XERS ARE
ALL TOGETHER AGAIN?
 THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED LAST
NIGHT CLEARLY MADE SOME KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD CHRIS, HE
SAID, TONIGHT A LINE WILL BE
DRAWN.
 SO MY BACK IS UP AGAINST THE
WALL.
THERE'S GOING TO BE IMMUNITY
TOMORROW.
HOPEFULLY IT'S A CHALLENGE I
COULD WIN, BECAUSE IF NOT, I'M
IN TROUBLE, BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE GUNNING MY WAY.
 ADAM BASICALLY JUST RUBBED IT
IN MY FACE THAT I'M ON THE
BOTTOM.
 WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY TO
YOU?
 THAT WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM AND
WE'RE NEXT IN LINE AND THAT'S
IT.
 WHY WOULD ADAM SAY THAT TO
YOU?
 BECAUSE HE'S AN [BLEEPED]
 YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
 SO YOU DON'T LIKE WORKING
WITH HIM?
 I WANTED TO VOTE ADAM OUT
YESTERDAY JUST TO GET ADAM OUT
OF THE GAME SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO
WORK WITH HIM.
 I CAN CONFIRM THAT HE SAID
THIS.
 ADAM CAN'T BE SMART LIKE THE
REST OF US ARE.
 Andy: TRYING TO BRING WILL
AND JAY BACK INTO THE FOLD, ADAM
HAS TO GLOAT AND MAKE JAY FEEL
CRAPPY.
I'M JUST LIKE, ADAM, DON'T BE AN
IDIOT AND MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE
THAT'S WHEN THEY VOTE AGAINST
YOU.
 HERE IT COMES.
 OH, WOW.
 ISN'T THAT NICE?
 THAT LOOKS COOL.
 14 DAYS LEFT.
 IT'S A CRAZY GAME.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 UH-HUH.
I'M IN THE POSITION RIGHT NOW
WHERE JESSICA AND I ARE FRIENDLY
HELLOS, BUT SOMETHING IS
UNDERLYING THERE.
 I DON'T TRUST HER.
 WHY IS -- WHY DOES SHE HATE
YOU?
 BECAUSE I PUT HER NAME DOWN.
 SO DID I?
 SHE'S NICE.
WE CONNECT AS MOMS, BUT I JUST
THINK BECAUSE I VOTED FOR HER,
SHE'S REALLY GOING THE WANT TO
GET ME OUT.
 HELLO, SUNDAY.
 HELLO.
 WE'RE JUST LIKE, IT'S NICE
KNOWING YOU BOYS.
WHICH ONE OF US IS GOING HOME
NOW?
 ONE OF US IS GOING TO GET
EACH OTHER FIRST.
I CAN DEFINITELY USE JAY.
RIGHT NOW HE'S FEELING LIKE HE'S
AT THE BOTTOM.
WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP FROM OUR TIME AT
IKA BULA.
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO JAY.
 WHO WOULD BE YOUR PICK?
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE
AT?
 I'LL WRITE WHATEVER NAME,
SUNDAY.
I TOLD YOU, I'M WITH YOU.
I TRUST YOU WHOLLY.
 I DO YOU, TOO, I REALLY DO.
I'LL PUSH FOR JESS TODAY AND I'M
SURE IT WILL BE AN EASY... I
JUST FEEL LIKE SHE'S GOING TO BE
AFTER ME.
 THAT'S WHAT I DID WITH
MICHAELA.
 I'LL WRITE JESS TONIGHT
UNLESS FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU
GUYS ARE LIKE, WRITE THIS.
 YOU AND TAYLOR AND WILL.
 AS SOON AS SUNDAY SAYS
JESSICA, I'M LIKE, SWEET.
SAY ANYONE'S NAME BUT ME AND
TAILS AND WILL.
I HAVE TO STAY POSITIVE AND GIVE
GOOD ENERGY AND THE UNIVERSE
SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT WITH GIVING
IT BACK.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 OH, NO.
 WHAT IS THIS?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WILL.
TAKE IT BACK.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMONEYTY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE STAND ON A NARROW BEAM
WHILE BALANCING A BALL ON A
WOODEN BOW.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU WILL
MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM,
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.
IF AT ANY POINT YOUR BALL DROPS
OR YOU FALL OFF THE BEAM, YOU'RE
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE,
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME,
THE SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
THERE ARE MOMENTS IN EVERY
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" THAT EVEN
WITHOUT IMMUNITY YOU FEEL PRETTY
SAFE.
IF THAT IS YOU TODAY, I HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY.
 OH, NO.
 HERE WE GO.
 Jeff: YOU CAN OPT TO SIT
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE, GIVE UP
YOUR SHOT AT IMMUNITY, AND EAT,
GRILLED HAM AND CHEESE
SANDWICHES, SALTY POTATO CHIPS,
ICE COLD BEER, AND SOFT DRINKS.
LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
ZEKE AND WILL ARE SITTING OUT.
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO FEEL
SAFE ENOUGH TO HAVE NO SHOT AT
IMMUNITY.
YOU CAN START EATING.
LET'S GET THIS CHALLENGE ON.
EVERYBODY TAKE YOUR SPOT.
I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU IN.
 I OPTED TO EAT BECAUSE I KNEW
I WASN'T GOING TO WIN THAT
CHALLENGE AGAINST SURFER GUYS.
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BEAT
ME, SO I COULD LOSE AND GO BACK
THE CAMP WITH NOTHING, OR I
COULD EAT AND GO BACK THE CAMP
WITH A FULL BELLY.
 Jeff: FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE... THIS CHALLENGE IS
ON.
IT'S NOT EASY TO BALANCE THAT
BALL ON THAT BOW WHILE ON A
NARROW BEAM.
WE WILL GO FIVE MINUTES IN THIS
ROUND, AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO
THE NEXT SECTION.
HANNAH IN TROUBLE BUT A NICE
SAVE BY HANNAH.
HANNAH FIRST OUT.
WILL JOIN WILL AND ZEKE, BUT
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT OR STEAL
A CHIP OR CITIZENSHIP OF BEER OR
A SOFT DRINK.
WILL, YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DRINK
BEER, RIGHT?
 YEAH, I KNOW.
 Jeff: WE'RE DOWN THE NINE.
VERY CLEAR FROM THE CHOICES MADE
THAT THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY UP
IN THE AIR.
WILL AND ZEKE HAVE PERCEIVED
CERTAINTY.
THE REST OF YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR
ACTUAL CERTAINTY.
I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU DOWN.
WHEN I GET TO ZERO, YOU'RE SAFE.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
YOU ARE SAFE.
WE'RE GOING THE MOVE DOWN NOW TO
THE NEXT SECTION.
YOU MUST HAVE ONE FOOT NOW IN
THE SECOND SECTION OF BEAM.
IT'S A LITTLE MORE NARROW.
GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT.
HERE WE GO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE...
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.
SUNDAY IN TROUBLE QUICKLY BUT A
NICE SAVE.
GREAT RECOVERY.
THAT WIND CAN COME UP OUT OF
NOWHERE.
BRET'S BALL ON THE MOVE NOW BUT
QUICKLY RECOVERS.
ON THE MOVE AGAIN.
COULDN'T RECOVER.
BRET IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
CHRIS WITH SOME MOVEMENT NOW AND
A NICE SAVE.
 WHY DIDN'T I OPT OUT?
 WHY DIDN'T I OPT OUT?
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO,
ONE.
THIS ROUND IS OVER.
FOR THIS NEXT SECTION, YOU WILL
NOW HAVE ONE FOOT IN THE MOST
NARROW PART OF THE BEAM.
THIS WILL BE THE TRICKIEST PART
OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE WILL STAY HERE FOR 20
MINUTES.
HERE WE GO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
WE'RE BACK ON THE THIRD AND
FINAL SECTION.
IMMEDIATELY JESSICA'S OUT.
SUNDAY'S OUT.
DAVID'S OUT.
THREE DROP.
CHRIS IS OUT.
WE ARE QUICKLY DOWN TO FOUR.
IT IS JAY, ADAM, TAYLOR AND KEN
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY THAT
CLEARLY EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR
WILL AND ZEKE THINKS THEY NEED.
ADAM IN TROUBLE.
JAY NOW IN TROUBLE AND A NICE
SAVE.
ADAM IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
JAY IS OUT AND WE ARE NOW DOWN
TO TWO.
IT IS TAYLOR AND KEN, FITTINGLY
SIDE BY SIDE.
TAYLOR WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT
AND WHISTLING.
A LITTLE MOVEMENT BY TAYLOR BUT
A NICE RECOVERY.
KEN WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT.
 KEN'S GOING DOWN.
KENNY.
 Jeff: TAYLOR IS OUT.
KEN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 NICE WORK, GUYS.
NICE WORK.
KEN, COME ON OVER.
 YEAH, KENNY.
 Jeff: NICE JOB.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
KEN IS SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 25
DAYS OUT HERE, SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT, THE
SECOND MEMBER OF THE JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 LEAVING THE CHALLENGE ALL I'M
THINKING TO MYSELF IS IT'S
EITHER GOING TO BE ME OR TAILS
TONIGHT, BUT SUNDAY TOLD ME
JESSICA, SO MY LIFE IS BASICALLY
IN SUNDAY'S HANDS AT THE MOMENT.
 GREAT JOB, KEN.
 NICE JOB.
 SIT IN THE HAMMOCK.
 THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE CAME
DOWN TO BATTLE BETWEEN KEN AND
TAYLOR, BUT IN THE END KEN
PULLED OUT A WIN.
 BOY, IT'S HOT.
 I'M DOWN FOR A SWIM.
 ME, TOO.
 NOW WE HAVE OUR CHOICE
BETWEEN WHETHER TO VOTE OUT JAY
OR TAYLOR.
WILL IS SAFE BECAUSE HE'S SEEN
AS LESS OF A THREAT.
 WE NEED FIREWOOD.
 BUT AN IDOL COULD COME INTO
PLAY TONIGHT.
WHOEVER TAYLOR AND JAY WANT TO
GO HOME GOES HOME.
 I'LL GET SOME FIREWOOD.
 SO THE SAFEST BET IS TO SPLIT
THE VOTES.
 SO WHAT'S OUR BEST MOVE,
GUYS, SPLITTING THEM?
 YEAH.
 ARE WE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?
LET'S GET SUNDAY OVER HERE.
 THERE'S EVAN AND JESS.
SHOULD WE INCLUDE THEM?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK, JESS?
 WE'RE SCARED OF AN IDOL.
I LIKE THE SPLIT.
 I LIKE THAT.
 IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE,
WE THINK IT'S THE SAFEST BET TO
SPLIT THE VOTES BETWEEN TAYLOR
AND JAY.
JAY IS THE BIGGEST SCHEMER, THE
BIGGEST PLOTTER.
TAYLOR IS THE LEAST TRUSTWORTHY
OF THE TWO.
 YOU VOTE JAY?
 YEAH, YEAH.
 WE'RE GOOD.
 BECAUSE WE'RE SPLITTING THE
VOTES, I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT
THAT ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO GO
HOME.
 WHAT'S UP?
 I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT I'LL GO
WITH IT.
I DON'T WANT THE WRITE JAY DOWN.
 IF IT WERE UP TO ME, I WOULD
100% LIKE THE SEE JESSICA GO
HOME.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT JESSICA.
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE
NUMBERS ARE, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY THAT I WOULD BE
MAKING THE MOVE.
 EEL TALK TO BRET.
LET'S GO GET BRET.
 IT'S A BUMMER BECAUSE I
WANTED TO USE JAY TO MAKE A MOVE
AGAINST JESSICA.
 OUCH.
 THE MAJORITY WANTS YOU OR
TAYLOR.
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
 THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT TO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO.
 THIS SUCKS.
EVERYTHING THAT WE PLANNED IS
OUT THE WINDOW.
AND I HATE BEING ON THE FRICKEN
BOTTOM, MAN.
 THERE YOU GO.
 HEY, YOU KNOW...
 YEAH.
 TONIGHT IT'S EITHER ME OR
TAYLOR, BUT I'M STILL IN THE
RING, STILL THROWING PUNCHES.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.
 WE HAVE TO WALK DOWN TO THE
RAFT.
 YOU HAVE A BUNKER FULL OF
FOOD.
 NO, YOU DON'T.
 YEAH, I DO.
 I KNOW THAT IT'S EITHER ME OR
YOU TONIGHT.
 SO LET'S HAVE OUR FEAST
TOGETHER.
 MY CLOSEST FRIEND OUT HERE IS
TAILS, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL
TAYLOR I HAVE AN IDOL.
 YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME,
DUDE.
 NO, I'M NOT.
 THE BUNKER OF FOOD, MY
FRIEND.
 I LOVE YOU.
 I GOT THREE OPTIONS WITH MY
IMMUNITY IDOL.
PLAN "A," PUT IT ON MY NECK, BE
LIKE, YO, FORGET YOUR PLAN, I'M
NEVER GOING ANYWHERE.
 THIS IS THE LAST MEAL.
 OPTION B, PUT IT ON TAILS
NECK, BUT IF THEY'RE SPLITTING
THE VOTE, THAT CROWD BACKFIRE
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M
GONE.
 I GOT A GOOD FEELING IT'S ME,
BRO.
 CHEERS, DUDE.
 OR OPTION C, JUST BE QUIET
ABOUT IT, HOPE FOR THE BEST, AND
JUST SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
SMART.
IT COULD BITE ME IN THE ASS.
 ONE OF US IS GOING.
 ADAM HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
 OH, YEAH?
 YEAH.
AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS: IT'S
THAT HE CAN STEAL SOMEONE'S
REWARD.
 WOW.
 IS A LOVED ONE VISIT, HE CAN
SWITCH IT ALL UP, NO MATTER WHO
WINS.
BUT HERE'S THE THING, ADAM KNOWS
ABOUT MY FOOD BUNKER, AND IN
EXCHANGE, HE WOULDN'T TELL
ANYONE ABOUT MY BUNKER FOR ME
NOT TELLING ANYONE ABOUT HIS
ADVANTAGE.
 ADVANTAGE?
 ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.
IF I STATE THAT ADAM HAS AN
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME, THAT'S
GOING TO PUT MASSIVE TARGET ON
HIS BACK.
 DUDE, THAT WILL RUIN HIS
GAME.
HE VOTED OUT FIGGY.
 YEAH.
IN MY MIND, I'M STILL HOLDING A
LOT OF ANIMOSITY TOWARD ADAM.
 DO IT, DUDE.
 I AM AN AVENGER OF FIGGY AT
THIS POINT.
 CRAZY DAY TODAY.
 OH, I KNOW.
OH, I KNOW.
 IF YOU STEAL THE LOVED ONE'S
VISIT, THOSE PEOPLE HATE YOU,
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A LOT
MORE LEVERAGE AGAINST HIM THAN
HE HAS ON ME.
PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW I STEAL
FOOD, WHO CARES?
FIGS TOLD ME THE FIGHT AS HARD
AS I COULD, GET TO THE END OF
THIS, AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO.
THIS, AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO.
 Jeff: WE'LL NO BRING IN THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
MICHELLE VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
JAY, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT
BACK THE CAMP AFTER LAST TRIBAL?
 OH, MAN, JEFF, AS A FAN, I
WISH I WAS ON THAT SIDE, BUT
BEING A PLAYER ON THE WRONG
SIDE, HOPEFULLY I GET SOME NEW
INFO OR SOMEBODY THROWS ME A
BONE, BECAUSE IT FELT PRETTY
CRAPPY BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE
HONESTLY.
 WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
JAY IS NOT THE FIRST PERSON IN
THIS GAME TO BE BLINDSIDED.
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME.
IT'S HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE SITTING HERE.
 WELL, OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S THE GAME "SURVIVOR."
 Jeff: SO, JAY, YOU AND ADAM
CLEARLY ARE NOT VOTING TOGETHER
TONIGHT.
 I'D LOVE TO WRITE HIS NAME
DOWN AGAIN.
HONESTLY, JEFF, I'LL BE REAL
WITH IT.
 Jeff: DO YOU, TAYLOR AND
WILL, FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN
TROUBLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF LAST
TRIBAL?
 OH, FOR SURE, JEFF.
 ALL THREE OF US, WE WERE ON
THE WRONG SIDE.
OH, MAN, MY CLOCK IS TICKING.
 Jeff: CHRIS, COULD YOU FEEL
THAT TAYLOR AND WILL AND JAY
BELIEVED THEY WERE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THAT LINE THAT HAD BEEN
DRAWN?
 SURE, I THINK THEY FELT THAT
THE FIRST NIGHT, BUT I'VE BEEN
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LINE,
AND YOU JUST WORK YOURSELF BACK
IN, SO PLAY THE GAME, GET BACK
IN THERE.
THERE'S CRACKS.
 Jeff: INTERESTING.
 THANK YOU.
 OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING.
SO WHEN I GOT CAUGHT EATING
BANANA CHIPS, I WASN'T TRYING TO
BE SNEAKY, BUT I DID HIDE TWO
JARS FULL, PACKED FULL OF FOOD
AND BURIED THEM, AND ADAM HELPED
ME DO IT.
 THEY HAD THREE JARS BURIED
IN THE SAND.
 LET ME CLEAR THE AIR, IF
I MAY.
I DID NOT HELP TAYLOR BURY
ANYTHING.
 YOU ATE THE FOOD.
 I DID NOT EAT ANY OF THAT
FOOD AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.
I WATCHED YOU DIG THE HOLE.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT.
 YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFAMING
MY CHARACTER.
 I WATCHED HIM.
I DID NOT HELP HIM AND I NEVER
ATE THAT FOOD, NOT ONCE.
 WHY IS ADAM SO UPSET ABOUT
IT?
 BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING THAT I
HELPED YOU DO IT.
 ALL I DID WAS KEEP YOUR
SECRET, TAYLOR.
 WHAT SPECIFIC FOOD WAS IN THE
JARS?
 I SMASHED AS MUCH STUFF IN
THERE AS I COULD?
 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
 IT'S GONE.
 YOU ATE IT?
 ME AND JAY ATE IT TODAY
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
VOTING US OUT.
 TODAY?
 YEP, BUT IF YOU GUYS WANT TO
GUN FOR ME AND JAY, THE BIGGER
THREAT IS OVER THERE, BECAUSE HE
TOLD ME A LITTLE SECRET.
 OH, MY GOD.
 ADAM HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS
GAME.
 WHAT?
 THAT IS THE TRUTH.
 I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
 THERE REALLY IS AN ADVANTAGE?
 ADAM, WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE?
 MY ADVANTAGE IS THAT AT ANY
POINT IF I LOSE A REWARD, I CAN
PLAY THE ADVANTAGE AS IF I HAD
WON THE REWARD.
 SO IN OTHER WORDS HE CAN
STEAL YOUR LOVED ONE'S VISIT.
 NOT NECESSARILY.
 THAT MEANS SOMEONE IS GOING
TO GET THEIR LOVED ONE RIPPED
FROM THEIR HANDS EVEN THOUGH YOU
WON.
 BUT IT'S AN ADVANTAGE THAT
DOESN'T IMPACT THE GAME.
IT'S A REWARD...
 IT DOES IMPACT THE GAME, MAN.
 IT'S A REWARD.
IT'S NOT ABOUT... IN HERE AND IN
HERE, THAT IMPACTS THE GAME,
BRO.
 HOW DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE
ADVANTAGE?
 I TOLD TAYLOR.
CLEARLY I MADE A MISTAKE IN WHO
I COULD TRUST.
BUT I DID NOT BURY ANY FOOD OR
EAT ANY FOOD THAT WAS BURIED.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG FROM
THE START.
AND IF THE ADVANTAGE THAT I GOT
IS SO TERRIBLE, THEN VOTE ME
OUT.
 WOW.
 Jeff: DAVID, THAT WAS WITH
THE EQUIVALENT OF A "SURVIVOR"
BOMBING WITH DROPPED.
 HUGE BOMB.
I'M STUNNED.
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE AND I'M
STUNNED.
I DO FEEL ADMITTING WHAT YOU DID
IS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR
ONE OF YOU.
 NO OTHER CHOICE.
 THE REASON HE HAD NO OTHER
CHOICE IS BECAUSE HE KNEW AS
SOON AS HE REVEALED MY SECRET I
WAS OF COURSE GOING TO REVEAL
HIS.
IF I KNOW I CAN GET AHEAD BY
EATING MORE FOOD THAN THESE
GUYS, I'M GOING TO DO IT.
 Jeff: JESSICA, DO YOU THINK
WHAT TAYLOR IS EXPRESSING IS
MILLENNIAL, THAT IDEA THAT YOU
JUST, WELL, YEAH, I DID IT.
HERE'S WHY.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
 I THINK TAYLOR IS LOOKING FOR
A PAT ON THE BACK, LIKE IT'S
OKAY, YOU TOLD US, YOU CAME
CLEAN.
 Jeff: HERE A TROPHY.
 YOU ARE ABAS ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT.
THAT'S NOT HOW I WAS RAISED.
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE WAY
CHRIS OR KEN OR BRET OR ANYONE
ELSE...
 WHY DID YOU SKIP ME?
I DIDN'T HIDE THOSE JARS.
I'M IN THE LIKE THAT.
SO THAT'S NOT COOL WITH ME.
SO I WAS PISSED AT ADAM AND
TAILS.
TAILS IS ONE OF MY HOMIES FROM
HOME, GET DRUNK, HAVE FUN, GO
WITH THE FLOW, ME ON THE OTHER
HAND, I HAVE DREAMS AND GOALS.
I'M NOT JUST A REGULAR DUMB
SURFER.
I'M TRYING THE FURTHER MY LIFE,
NO OFFENSE, DUDE.
NO OFFENSE.
BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT FROM TAYLOR
TODAY THAT HIM AND ADAM BURIED
IT, IF I WAS IN ADAM'S POSITION,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, THIS
ISN'T RIGHT, DUDE, THIS ISN'T
MORALLY RIGHT.
 ADAM, HE'S BRINGING UP A
STRONG POINT, WHICH IS NOT
SAYING SOMETHING CAN OFTEN BE
SEEN AS JUST AS BAD.
 FIRST OF ALL THIS, IS COMING
FROM THE GUY WHO ALREADY
ADMITTED EATING THIS FOOD.
 CRUMBS.
 THERE WERE ONLY CRUMBS.
BUT YOU ATE IT.
 BUT HE SAID YOU DID, AND JUST
BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR," I'M NOT GOING TO
DROP MY MORALS WHEN EVERYONE IS
STARVING.
 YOU ATE THE FOOD.
I DID NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 Jeff: JAY, YOU'RE ACCUSING
ADAM OF NOT SAYING ANYTHING, BUT
YOU HAVE TO OWN THE OTHER HALF,
WHICH IS YOU'RE ADMITTING THAT I
DID EAT SOME OF IT?
 I'M GOING TO ADMIT.
I HAD SOME FOOD, YES.
 HE JUST SAID HE WOULD NOT
TAKE FOOD FROM STARVING PEOPLE
AND ADMITTED TO EATING IT, WHICH
I DID NOT DO.
 SO YOU SAY.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: HANNAH, WHERE ARE WE
FOR THE VOTE TONIGHT?
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND NOBODY IS
GOING TO DISAGREE WITH VOTING
OUT ADAM BECAUSE HE HAS AN
ADVANTAGE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE
TAYLOR AND JAY, WHO BOTH
ADMITTED NOW TO EATING FOOD.
 THE GAME IS ALWAYS MORE
COMPLICATED THAN A SIMPLE
DISAGREEMENT.
IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU CAN TRUST.
IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT FUTURE
VOTES AND FUTURE PARTNERSHIPS.
I MEAN, THERE MIGHT BE AN IDOL
IN PLAY.
THERE ARE IDOLS IN PLAY.
IT COMPLICATES EVERYTHING.
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT A SIMPLE GAME.
 Jeff: BRET, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE?
 I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS
SEVERAL DIFFERENT ERRORS HERE,
AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW
IS WHO IS THE MOST CULPABLE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.
ADAM, YOU'RE UP.
ADAM, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE JAY.
TAYLOR.
ADAM.
ONE VOTE JAY, ONE VOTE TAYLOR,
ONE VOTE ADAM.
JAY.
TWO VOTES JAY.
 SURPRISE, SURPRISE.
 Jeff: TAYLOR.
TWO VOTES TAYLOR.
JAY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES JAY.
TAYLOR.
WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES TAYLOR,
THREE VOTES JAY, ONE VOTE ADAM.
JAY.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JAY.
TAYLOR.
TIED AGAIN.
FOUR VOTES TAYLOR, FOUR VOTES
JAY, ONE VOTE ADAM.
TAYLOR.
FIVE VOTES TAYLOR, FOUR VOTES
JAY.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
TAYLOR.
THAT'S SIX.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO WRING ME YOUR TORCH.
TAYLOR, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
SORRY FOR STEALING FOOD.
WELL, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ABOUT
STRATEGY.
EVERY SO OFTEN IT'S JUST ABOUT
CONSEQUENCES.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 THREE OF US VOTE OUT CHRIS.
 Jeff: THE GEN XERS ARE
IMPLODING.
 IT'S A GEN X CIVIL WAR.
 Jeff: AND WILL PUTS HIS
TRUST IN ZEKE.
 JAY DOES HAVE AN IDOL.
 I DON'T WANT TO TELL TOO MANY
PEOPLE.
 JAY DOES HAVE AN IDOL.
 THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
 JAY DOES HAVE AN IDOL.
 DID YOU HEAR WHAT WILL TOLD
ZEKE?
 MY "SURVIVOR" ADVENTURE HAS
BEEN QUITE EPIC.
I CAME OUT HERE RUNNING THROUGH
THE NIGHT AND SNEAKING FOOD.
I LIVED THROUGH A HURRICANE,
MADE A NEW GREAT FRIEND, HIS
NAME IS JAY.
I GOT A GIRLFRIEND, AND
HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO BUY A
SAILBOAT AND GO HAVE SOME
ADVENTURES TOGETHER, SO I'M
PRETTY STOKED ABOUT THAT.
