GENIE:
Right now, I don't know
what to trust.
I don't know who to trust.
I had no idea this was coming.
I mean, the only person that
was more blindsided was Brad,
and he went home.
I thought we were voting JD.
-So-so now, now I know.

I'm on the bottom of this.
Hold on. I know... I...








-Hold on.

You guys do your own food.
I'm-a do my own food.
And you guys work
as hard as you want,

as hard as I want for myself.
I've been, like,
feeding them, dude.
I've been, like, the mom.
I've been, like, in the kitchen.
I know nobody wants
to do that ....
Nobody wants
to tend to the fire.
If you don't want
to work with me,
I'm not taking care of you guys.
I'm not.
Genie, I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna squash this right now,
and I'm gonna
tell you something, okay?








And nobody else knows this,
but Brad had an advantage
that he didn't tell you about.
He got the, the Steal a Vote.
He only told me that.
I was Brad's number one.
Brad wasn't
taking you anywhere, boo.
-Wow.
-And he didn't...
He kept you
out of the loop on that.
That's crazy.
Bro, kudos to him. Played me.
I'm mad because
when Shan found out
that I was not telling her
about my extra vote,
she made me
feel terrible about it.
I, literally,
gave her my advantage.
And then for me
to find out that
she was actually withholding
information from me, as well.
I was like, "You played me."
I don't understand why I was
kind of raked over the coals,
in a way, for not telling
people about my advantage,
and then there's just
all this information
that I had no idea about.
SHAN:
Brad told me that
in confidence.
That's his stuff.
You won something.
Yeah, that's my stuff.
I'd like it back in my bag.
Oh, okay.
You can have it back.
You can have it back.
You know, I think she gave me
the extra vote back
'cause she actually
does trust me.
And now that bad boy
is back in my bag.
But fool me once, shame on me.

That's the end of it.
You're not gonna fool me twice.

PROBST:
Danny, can you let yourself down
when you're trying to do
something you've never done
and have no expectation
to know how to do it?
Absolutely not. The only way
you can let yourself down
is if you don't give
100% effort, and she gave it.
And, Heather,
I just got to say, for me,
one of the reasons
I'm still here,
21 years later,
is because of moments like that.
I love the gameplay
of Survivor,
but I really like it
when somebody's vulnerable
and lets us watch
-and then is rewarded with love
from their competitors.
-Mm-hmm.
That's got to make you
feel a little better.
It does. It does.
All right, now let's get
to the victors.
-Ua, your reward is waiting
for you back at camp.

I encourage you to soak up
as much as you can.
This guy is an expert.
Grab your stuff, head back,
enjoy.

-Good job, guys.
-Good job.
Yase, one fish for the tribe.
Come grab it.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Oh, he's so pretty, or she.
Luvu, got nothing for you.
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff.
HEATHER:
When you fail at something,
it hurts like hell
and you're embarrassed.
But with every failure,
you're told
it molds you into who you are.
And it sounds so cliché,
but it does.
At 52 years old,
I'm already coming out here
with a disadvantage,
but I didn't give up.
I just felt so proud of myself.
This personal victory
made me even stronger.
And that's why
I love Survivor.

You've been in last before.
You know what it's like,
and you know how to pull it out.
One, two, three! Go!
-(whooping)
-One, two, three. Go!
-Luvu getting closer
and closer to the end.
-Go!
-Go!
-DANNY: I'm, like,
trying my hardest
-not to push these blocks.
-One, two, three. Go!
But Naseer is an animal
at this point.
He's just, "One, two."
(in slow motion):
Go!
(Danny laughs)
Like, goodness.
-One, two. Go!
-That's it, Luvu.
-You're good.
-SYDNEY: Yeah, you're good.
PROBST:
Ua getting closer but starting
to slow down,
and that's opening
the door for Yase to catch up.
You got it. Go, go, go.
PROBST:
It's now Xander
using his chest
to push 'em through.
Now Luvu is looking for a key.
There is one key
in one of those pieces of wood.
-There's blocks behind...
-DESHAWN: I'm hoping and praying
that I'll find this freaking key
in this block,
'cause I'm gonna toss this block
so far away.
-Come on.
-You got it?
-PROBST: They've got the key.
-Go, I got it.
Freaking Erika finds the key.
PROBST:
Unlock the rings.
-Ua-- one more log will do it.
-(grunts)
You're good, Ua.
One more for Yase.
-You're good, Yase. Let's go.
-DANNY: Go. Come on.
SYDNEY:
Let's go, Deshawn!
DESHAWN:
So I step up and do some rings.
I'm like, "Yes,
this is my prime opportunity
to freaking throw
the challenge."
-XANDER: Got it.
-TIFFANY: You got it.
PROBST:
Xander now has the key.
-You got it.
-Look at this.
Yase quickly found their key.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Here comes Shan.
She's got her key for Ua.
-You got it...
-Can I go?
PROBST:
Tiffany's up.
And Tiffany lands the first one.
-It is Yase now in the lead.
-Yes!
-Yeah.
-PROBST: JD sticks one for Ua.
Deshawn for Luvu.
-Just short.
-Come on, Liana.
-Gonna be Liana.
-Yes!
-Liana with her first toss.
-Yes, Liana.
Yase's one ring away
from winning this.
You got it, Liana,
just like you did
-the first time.
-Just short.
JD trying to tie it up.
-Just misses.
-GENIE: Come on, JD!
DANNY: Let me know
if you want to switch.
-Ah. Hold on.
-PROBST: Deshawn short again.
Going to take more than that.
PROBST:
Here comes Naseer.
DESHAWN:
So I'm trying to drag that part.
That didn't last long
because Naseer run up
at the freaking ring toss.
Like, really?
Of course Naseer would do this.
-Yes!
-Oh!
-PROBST:
Naseer snags one for Luvu.
-Ah! Go, Naseer!
Come on, guys. Let's go.
-PROBST: Luvu has one now.
-Oh!
Naseer with a second one
-for Luvu.
-Yes, Naseer, yes!
Luvu with two,
Yase with two.
-Naseer could win this.
-So close.
Just a little bit harder.
-Yes.
-PROBST: Naseer just got hot
and could win it
for Luvu right here.
-Oh!
-Just short.
-Xander could win it.
-DANNY: Take your time.
Take your time.
-There you go.
-Yes!
Xander does it for Yase!
We're looking for one more.
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yes!
It is now Ua and Luvu.
-Ua with one, Luvu with two.
-Ah.
Come on.
JD with his second.
We are tied. Here it is.
JD versus Naseer.
-On and off again.
-That was in and out.
-That was in and out.
-It's got to stick. JD.
On and off.
Naseer. On and off.
-Unbelievable.
-Don't look at it.
-Don't look at it.
-Both guys so close.
Aah!
-(cheering)
-Naseer wins it for Luvu!
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Sending Ua
-to Tribal Council.
-I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.
DESHAWN: The win very much felt
like a loss to me.
Naseer was just the man
at that challenge.
He-he had his moment.
And I'm proud of him
because Naseer is a good guy.
He deserves the moment.
I just didn't want that moment
to be at that challenge.
Yase, congratulations.
-(whooping)
-Nice to have the big idol.
Yeah.
No Tribal, nobody going home.
Luvu, no Tribal Council,
tribe stays tight
-at six.
-Thanks, Jeff.
Grab your stuff, head out.
Yase, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.
Enjoy the night off.
Ua, head back to camp.
I'm gonna keep your flint.
See you tonight at Tribal.
SHAN:
Genie might be the one
on the outside,
but JD wants
to be the superstar.
He's so concerned about looking
like Allen Iverson. He's like,
"Money!" and it doesn't land.
We're like,
"There's no money there.
"You should have
shouted out 'Tribal!'
Because that's where
we ended up."
♪ ♪
(birds singing,
insect buzzing)
It's me, dude.
It's got to be me.
-I mean, the original...
-They blindsided me.
They didn't want to tell me
what was going on.
Shan was in on it.
Ricard is a mastermind.
This is what I'm thinking.
-I'm gonna throw that die.
-Yeah.
And if you can just
write down "Ricard."
The second go-to name
would be him.
That's-that's the only
game plan I have.
Are you 100% rolling your die?
I think so.
I don't want a souvenir.
I'm gonna play that.
It's like a Hail Mary.
I'm thinking about playing
the Shot in the Dark.
However, if you roll the die,
you cannot even vote.
So that is very risky.
I'm terrified tonight.
I would probably
be crying right now
if I didn't already lose
all of my liquids through sweat.
-I'm up against the wall.
-Yeah, I know.
I feel like
I'm in the same spot.
It could be either of us who...
-And I don't want
to roll my die, you know?
-Yeah.
-You know...
-That's a balls-to-the-wall
move.
I'm lying to Genie.
I had to convince her that
I'm so dedicated to her
so she doesn't roll her die.
If she rolls her die
and gets safety,
I could be going home.
My mindset is,
"Genie, Genie,
Genie, Genie, Genie.
I have to get rid of Genie."
I trust you, and
I trust Shan,
'cause we're a three.
But, like, Genie wants me
to put a vote on you.
I'm not doing that.
That's freaking stupid.
I need you and Shan.
Look at Miss Sneaky Genie.
(laughs)
-GENIE: That's the thing.
-Ricard?
-Yeah.
-No, Genie. I think we're...
-No?
-Okay.
I think you can trust...
Ricard more
than you could trust JD.
Bottom line-- Ricard's been
my number one since day one.
Now Genie wants to vote Ricard,
so now my work is
having her think
that JD is the target
to convince Genie not
to roll her dice
'cause we're voting out Genie.
I'm just afraid
I'm gonna get blindsided.
But all I can give you
is my word.
-Okay.
-And I'm-I'm trusting Ricard,
too.
-All right.
-But JD is not trustworthy.
He's not stable.
I'm also
deeply concerned that if Genie
doesn't feel comfortable,
Genie could team up with JD
because JD has the extra vote.
Then we could go to a tie,
or a blindside could
potentially be pulled off.
I've got to... I've got
to figure that out.
I've got to address that.
I'm gonna act paranoid.
I'm gonna say to him, "JD,
"I feel like
you're working with Genie.
"The only way I'm willing
to work with you
"is if you give me
your advantage
"and we vote Genie
because I feel like
you're gonna use that
against me with Genie."
What I'm trying
to get is that advantage.
It wouldn't matter if you had
that vote. It wouldn't matter.
I think you're working
a blindside with Genie on me.
Why?
I don't know.
I just get that feeling.
I promise you, that's not
what hap... what's happening.
For someone who plays so well,
plays so well--
she's a very good player--
she freaks out so easily.
-I don't... I...
-JR: Her name has not even
been in the mix.
You're not gonna play me, right?
I'm not playing you, Shan.
Shan,
you're getting a little, like...
You're not voting me tonight
that you're not gonna...
-I'm not.
-So you're not gonna
use your advantage?
-That'd be dumb if I used it.
-So can you leave it here?
I'm not... Like, what if
something pops off at Tribal,
-and I need to use it?
-I'm not... I'm not not...
I'm not... I'm taking you with
me, though, unless you're not
-taking me.
-I am.
So then why... so then...
You should always bring your
advantages to Tribal, though.
I don't want to be that dummy
who leaves their advantage
back at camp.
I came to contribute
to the evolution of the game,
not become one of the dummies
who ruins it.
You can get it tomorrow,
'cause we'll all still be here.
All I'm asking is
for a token of trust.
If that... if that will make you
trust me, I'll do it.
SHAN:
You know, again, like,
when I'm up to something
that I probably
shouldn't be doing,
I hum this song.
(humming)
(humming)
(humming)
JD:
You can kind of see in her eyes
that she's genuine
about actually thinking that
I'm gonna blindside her,
and me giving her that vote
showed her, "I trust you.
I'm giving you this."
Thank you...
for trusting me, trusting you.
JD:
I've done all
I can do to convince her
I'm with her,
and once I get that extra vote
back, it's not going anywhere.
I promise. This time for real.
(humming)
SHAN:
Number one-- how the heck
did that just happen?
Number two-- I feel like I have
some power in my pocket
that I didn't actually have
to go off to an island to get.
Number three-- I'm thinking,
"Oh, my goodness,
what if I just
"keep the extra vote
for myself and
vote out JD?"
It's in my back pocket.
That would be a big move to get
his extra vote for good.
I might never get
this opportunity again, but JD
has become family to me.
He's like a little brother,
and I love him.
There we go.
Ah, good job.
And I don't want
to be a villain,
but I-I do want
to be an assassin.
SHAN: With Genie,
you know, she's hurt.
We blindsided her with Brad.
I just feel
she doesn't really trust me.
So this is a hard vote. I feel
like tonight I'm holding
both of their lives in my hand.
And so, I go to my song
in my head.

PROBST:
Wow, Genie.
Your face, your body language.
I'm exhausted. I... (sighs)
I'm-I'm playing from the bottom.
It's not a good day for me.
PROBST:
This is clearly a turning point
for this tribe.
I can feel it. I felt it
at the challenge when you lost.
So, Ricard, help the audience
understand what these moments
really feel like.
It's so weird,
going from audience member
to now being in this seat.
You know, you want
to pick off the people
that you hate when you're
watching them on the screen.
But with every vote out,
it genuinely hurts our feelings.
SHAN:
Yeah, we're bonding so that
we can survive the jungle.
Like, we're close,
we're farting on each other,
we're burping on each other,
and everybody does it.
-I don't care.
-I didn't do that.
SHAN:
Everybody lets a little gas go
at night.
-I hear it, okay, so...
-(laughing)
You know, and then it just
juxtaposes the reality of, like,
your life ends here, like,
this is the end of the road.
-So it's hard.
-PROBST: And, JD,
when you're watching at home,
it's easy.
You're sitting on your sofa,
bag of chips. You're like,
"I'd cut him, no problem.
Wouldn't have any emotion
at all."
Then you get out here--
to Shan's point-- not so easy.
JD:
Yeah. On the other hand,
leaning more on strategy,
what the viewer has
-that we don't all have
is information.
-There you go.
They know everything that's
going on-- who's lying to who--
and that's why I'm sitting
on the couch, being like,
"Malcolm,
what are you doing, bro?
-Like, they're coming for you."
-(Shan laughs)
PROBST:
So, Genie,
let's get back to you.
You walk in,
and the first thing you say is,
"I'm playing from the bottom."
I mean, the last Tribal, I was
just as blindsided as-as Brad.
So, you know you're on
the bottom of the tribe.
Because you didn't have
the information.
I didn't have the information,
and nobody wanted
to give it to me.
And-and... and I was
really thinking
we were gonna win
that immunity challenge
because we got a lot
of energy from that.
The fish and-and all these
things that we were taught
by the awesome Nathan. You know,
oh, my God, that guy is amazing.
And then this happens,
and now I'm scrambling.
I mean,
people are making me promises,
but how am I supposed
to really believe them?
-You know what I mean? Like...
-It's tough.
-Uh, yeah, it's freaking tough.
-So, Ricard,
with four people,
it's two-two or three-one.
And two-two would mean
that there are two pairs
that are locked in.
-Is that a possibility?
-I think it is a possibility.
I hope that's not the case.
I believe
that's not the case,
but anything is possible.
I don't believe it, Jeff.
It's gonna be three-one on me.
I think they're just trying
to appease me right now
or whatever, so I don't roll
this Shot in the Dark.
It's another new element
to the game
-that can cause a lot of havoc.
-Absolutely. Exactly.
This is the only thing I have
that-that I feel like I can take
-in my own hands.
-I respect that play.
Just keep in mind, when you use
your Shot in the Dark,
you lose your vote,
and that potentially
could be messing up somebody
who is willing
to work with you.
Just make sure
we all do what we said
we were going to do.
PROBST:
Wow.
That is a complicated statement
JD just said.
Does that change how you feel,
or would you reveal it
if it did?
I'll probably make that decision
when I'm in there.
JD, I can feel the tension.
-Yeah.
-Even though
I've seen you at Tribal
-enough, tonight is different.
-JD: Yeah.
I felt like
I had to do scrambling,
and I think Ricard felt like
he had to do some scrambling.
My name's been written down.
-Genie.
-Yeah, my name's been
written down, Genie.
You know, so... just as much
as I don't want to go home,
these three people don't want
-to go home, either.
-Nobody wants to go home.
So, Shan, what's the worst part
of going home?
Not getting to the place
in the game where you wanted to.
You know, as much
as we're all visualizing
sitting in the final three,
grabbing that check
from you, um,
17 people are just not going
to get that.
17 people are going
to be disappointed.
If you get there,
you've killed a lot of dreams,
and if you don't,
then you've killed your own.
JD:
And the worst part of going home
for me would be this idea
that I built up in my head,
growing up, that I was going to
be some amazing Survivor player.
And I'll-I'll be honest.
I have not played the game
that I imagined myself playing.
I checked off a lot of boxes,
but the list is so long,
there's so many boxes
that I still want to check.
And, JD, regardless, how long
you last, you don't really
know what this journey
is going to be about
-until you get some perspective.
-Yeah.
I'm just not ready
for the perspective yet.
I'm not ready
to see the perspective.
I need to... I need
to do some more stuff out here.
Then I'll reflect.
In other words, "Probst,
enough with the therapy."
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-PROBST: So, Genie,
we started with you.
Let's end with you.
If it's you tonight,
what will you miss?
I mean, I'm going to miss
everything about this, but...
I have to say, I think
I'm actually gonna...
I'm gonna miss these guys.
Oh, Genie.
Does the emotion surprise you?
GENIE:
I mean, not really.
It's just, you know, you...
We're just... we're just beaten
down to, like, our bare bones
and just the emotions.
It just comes out
at any time, so...
I mean,
a lot of it is exhaustion,
and a lot of it is because
I truly believe we bonded.
This game is hard, and we...
-It's not supposed to be easy.
-Oh.
'Cause nothing good ever is.
