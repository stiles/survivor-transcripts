 --- 

        It's been a while.
I've missed you.
Well, I've missed the jungle,
and I've missed the ocean,
but mostly, I've missed
our time together.
Survivor started out as this
tiny little social experiment,
and it has evolved into one
of the most mentally draining,
physically challenging
and socially complicated games
ever seen on television.
And you've been there
every step of the way,
which is why we thought
it would be fun this season
to invite you inside the game
a little more,








make you coconspirators.
So, at times, you'll know
what's happening
before the players know.
You can play along,
second-guess, like this.
It's a new advantage,
the Beware Advantage.
This advantage comes with risk.
So, if you want this,
you better be sure.
What would you do
if you found it?
I'm gonna hide this
at the Yase tribe camp.
The other two tribes
will have one as well.
We just want
to have fun this season,
so we're gonna lean into
the best kind of Survivor fun,
the dangerous Kind.
Plus, we're gonna
increase the pace.








These players will go 26 days,
which means they have to hit
the ground running
because there will be nowhere
to hide and no time to hide.
Plus, small tribes, no rice,
penalties for losing,
and you've got to earn
everything.
And even then,
the unexpected dangerous twist
can take it all away.
What do you want from me?
We're just trying to evolve
the experiment a little more
and see how it goes,
and we'll do it together.
Oh, and for you younger
future Survivor players,
there's a game within the game
just for you.
(sighs)
Been too long. Glad to be back.

I am really freaking excited
to play Survivor.
I have studied this game,
I love this game,
and I can't express
how honored I am
to be part of
the first season back.
That's freaking crazy.
DANNY:
It's been a year and a half
of quarantine.
Your mind's going crazy.
And I would throw on Survivor,
and I would just binge-watch it
all day and all night.
I got to look forward
to seeing competition.
I'm a former NFL player,
and the competitive spirit
never leaves.
You're always trying to win
at something, so this is
the ultimate test for me.
TIFFANY:
Survivor kept me going
through pandemic.
I was an alternate-- I went from
possibly being casted
to you're not on the cast
to being called 24 hours
before you're going.
I'm freaking out.
I want to show my kids,
you know?
Mom said she's gonna be on
Survivor, and look, she's here.
Now you can really do anything.
Like, let's start
with making your bed.
JD:
I've been a fan of Survivor
since I could even watch TV.
I was born after Survivor.
It aired in 2000.
I was born in 2001.
And in my life, I always say
there are three constants.
There's my faith, uh, my family
and Survivor.
You know, take everything
that makes Survivor great
and inject it
into my bloodstream,
and-and there you have me, JD.
VOCE: As someone that is in
the hospitals on the front line,
honestly, this past year
has been pretty traumatizing
for me--
professionally, personally--
and so this is kind of
a complete reset for me.
I am beyond ready
to play this game.
SHAN: A lot of people
would think that pastors, like,
they can't play this game,
they can't play this game well
because they're soft
and, you know,
they want to take
the high road all the time.
Listen, I am
the mafia pastor, okay?
I am half Italian,
half Jamaican.
That means I'm cutthroat, okay?
Like, I will pray for you
and walk you out the door
at the same time.
I have no problem doing that.
SARA:
I think 2020 was probably
the worst year of my life.
COVID has made me more excited
to play the game.
ERIKA: Getting into the game,
I'm gonna be an animal
that's let out of its cage.
XANDER:
This is what

Come on up.
Opening moments
of your adventure.
As soon as I step foot
on that barge,
game on, game on.
This fantasy is a reality now.
PROBST:
More people coming on board.
GENIE:
We are a part
of this amazing game
and this amazing season.
PROBST:
Yeah, we need one more.
You want to play Survivor?
-(laughter)
-Yes!
PROBST:
Come on.
We got a room.
It's the best moment
of my life, really. (laughs)
All right, welcome to
the 41st season of Survivor.
Let it go.
(cheering)
We are so happy you're here.
I'm so happy I'm here.
We need us some Survivor.
We were lucky enough
to be invited back to Fiji.
You guys did
the full quarantine,
took all the tests--
you are safe.
We can play Survivor.
So let's play some Survivor.
Let's start. Guy in
the far back right corner,
-what's your name?
-Abraham.
Abraham, give me a number
and describe
the feeling right now
of excitement, one to ten.
Oh, ten, ecstatic.
No masks, no confinement.
-I'm feeling it.
-(laughter)
Right here in the middle,
what's your name?
-Erika.
-Same thing-- give me a number
one to ten, and describe
what that number feels like.
Oh, my gosh,
it's like a million.
I was supposed to come
last year,
and it got taken away
last minute.
And I think about, like--
so many people lost so much
during the pandemic
that they're never
going to get back,
but, like, we get to still
have this experience.
I-I can't believe it.
Guy in the back,
what's your name?
-Naseer.
-Naseer.
What is it, Naseer,
about this show
that keeps everybody coming back
with the same enthusiasm?
I can tell you, Jeff, this--
at this moment,
I'm the happiest human being
on the earth.
I started watching
Survivor season 21
and never been to America.
I hardly spoke English.
I learned English
watching Survivor.
(chuckles) Thank you.
-You are my teacher.
-(laughter)
And you're my dictionary, too.
I'm sorry about that.
Well, we're glad
to have you here.
-Woman in the front.
-Hi.
-What's your name?
-My name is Heather.
When did you first start
watching Survivor?
-20 years ago.
-So you... you're a day one.
-Day one. Day one.
-Right... right on.
What is it about this show
that you missed
when it wasn't on for a year?
Oh, I missed everything
about it.
This is routine for me.
This has been a habit.
I started watching 20 years ago
with my boyfriend,
who is now my husband,
and now we watch it
with our children.
-PROBST: Wow.
-So this has been a tradition
in my family--
or creating a family with you.
Thank you. Thank you for this.
Well, thank you
for the family experience,
because that is a big part
of why everybody here--
this entire crew behind me--
-makes this show...
-Yeah.
...is for families like yours.
That's what makes Survivor
special to us.
-Yeah.
-PROBST: All right.
Now, as we all know,
we are in the midst
of one of the most powerful,
still evolving periods of time
that we will probably ever
go through in our lives.
So, while you're out there
backstabbing, blindsiding,
swearing on kids that you may
or may not really have,
if something comes up
that you want to talk about it,
talk about it.
Who knows?
We might learn something.
In fact, I'll start because
I need your guidance
on something.
For 20 years,
I have used one phrase
to call people in
for challenges.
ALL:
Come on in, guys.
-(laughter)
-PROBST: "Come on in, guys."
Yeah.
Love saying it--
it's part of the show--
but I, too, want
to be of the moment.
So my question to you
to decide for us,
in the context of Survivor,
is a word like "guys" okay,
or is it time
to retire that word?
What do you think?
I personally think
"guys" is okay.
It's part of, you know--
"Come in, guys"
is, like, such a signature
expression, and, you know,
I as a woman, as a queer woman,
do not feel excluded by "guys."
Hmm. Yeah.
Does anybody disagree?
-No.
-We feel okay keeping "guys"?
"Guys" is good.
Okay, mark it down--
discussed and decided.
-(laughter)
-All right, tribe names.
Wearing blue, you are Luvu.
-Luvu.
-(whooping)
Wearing yellow,
Yase in the middle.
-Yase!
-(whooping)
-And Ua, wearing green.
-Ua! Yeah!
-Ua!
-Yeah.
PROBST:
I'm gonna tell you up front,
this season is going to be
more difficult than ever to win,
and here are
a few of the reasons.
It's going to be
a shorter season,
which means an already fast pace
will be relentless.
There will be no time to breathe
and nowhere to hide.
You are also starting
with very meager supplies.
One pot, one machete, one flint.
That's it.
No rice, no food source, and...
gameplay that I promise you
has never been so dangerous.
-Ooh!
-(whooping)
PROBST:
When you look at your box,
you see a four and a one,
my suggestion is
drop the four, keep the one.
This is a new era of Survivor.
Let's get to your first test
as brand-new tribes.
On this boat, scattered,
18 color-coded paddles,
six for each tribe.
On my go, you got to get
your six paddles
and your six tribe members
off this barge
and onto your raft.
Then you're gonna paddle out
and around a buoy
and race back to where
you'll see a flint
dangling from a pole.
The first tribe to get the flint
earns those meager supplies--
pot, machete, flint.
The other two tribes
will leave here with nothing.
You'll have to go back to camp
and try to earn them again,
wasting valuable
shelter-building time.
I wish you all good luck.
And go!
Survivor 41 is on!
Opening moments.
You don't know each other,
you've not said a word,
but you've got to quickly
figure out
how to work together.
You are looking for six
of your tribe-colored paddles.
They're not gonna be easy
to get to.
If there are knots,
you got to untie them.
If there's something on top
of it, you got to get it off.
ABRAHAM:
I got two.
PROBST:
All you need is six
of your paddles
and your six tribe members
off the barge and on your raft.
Somebody get in the water
for blue!
Here's another blue!
PROBST:
Doing a nice job there
gathering all their paddles,
and now they're
tossing them over.
Great strategy.
"Do they have all six?"
is the question.
VOCE: No, no, no, no!
One, two, three, four, five.
-There's one more yellow.
-One more.
One more yellow.
Ua has their sixth.
Blue, we got six.
Blue, we got six. Come on.
PROBST:
Who's gonna get all six paddles
and get to their boat first?
Danny's in the water.
Genie's in the water.
Brad getting ready to leap.
Nice entry.
All the paddles
were in the same spot,
so it's interesting
that one tribe is struggling.
-Nothing up here. I promise.
-VOCE: Okay.
-TIFFANY: We have 'em?
-ABRAHAM: No, we're missing one.
PROBST:
They were all in six groups.
What happened?
Hold it. Hold it.
Ready. Go, go!
Luvu has all six paddles
and all six players,
and they are heading out.
(indistinct shouting)
PROBST:
You got to unclip
in the front and the back.
PROBST:
Ua taking a long time.
-Okay.
-Paddle!
RICARD:
You two guys on the left...
PROBST:
Tiffany now in the water
for Yase.
Things not looking good
for Yase.
-Go, go!
-(indistinct shouting)
PROBST:
It is all Luvu right now.
Even though they appear
to be... not moving.
-One, two, three...
-PROBST: Slowly,
they are inching their way
out to that buoy.
We got it!
One, two, three.
PROBST:
Ua now in the water.
They have got a very good pace
out of the gate.
-Press it hard! Press it hard!
-(grunting)
PROBST:
Ua now with a really nice
group effort.
Ua now starting
to pull in the lead.
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Luvu is
going backwards.
Luvu got out to a fast start,
and literally,
it is if they are anchored
in the water.
One, two, three. Row.
We're not moving, guys.
PROBST:
It's now Ua pulling away.
Doing a great job
of paddling together
while Yase is suffering one
of the biggest embarrassments
-of any day one...
-VOCE: Thanks, Jeff.
...in Survivor history.
ABRAHAM:
I don't see it up here.
There is no shot
for Yase right now.
Turn your attention
to green and blue.
Ua is about to celebrate
a first very big
dominating victory
-out of the gate.
-SHAN: Go!
Keep going.
Push on that side from
the front, too, hard and down.
-(whoops)
-PROBST: Pull on it.
-Shan has it.
-(cheering)
Ua wins the first challenge.
Earns their tribe supplies.
Ua, your supplies will be
waiting for you back at camp.
Luvu, you're gonna have to
earn them another way.
Yase, you got bigger problems
than camp supplies.
-LIANA: Guys, it's up...
-VOCE: Oh, it's right up there.
EVVIE:
Oh, my God.
There it is.
At the last minute,
-Liana found it.
-EVVIE: Yeah, Liana.
PROBST:
Too little, too late.
Luvu!
We are not moving.
PROBST:
Luvu, I don't think
you unclipped in the back.
You're dragging an anchor.
-DESHAWN: Bro!
-(laughing)
Oh, no!
Yase, off the barge,
onto your raft.
Take your paddles.
You got to get going.
Let's go-- in the water.

So we walk up on the beach

crazy-looking hourglass

So, being a neurosurgeon,
you are constantly thinking
through scenarios.
And I really want
the Savvy option to be chosen.
One of the rules said
for the physical challenge,
only two people can do it
and the rest of the tribe
goes off.
And you would have to be
an idiot to do that,
because that means you're
sequestered from your tribe.
Like, we could definitely
do the water.
Like, I-I'd be willing
to work with you for that.

The-the one thing that I'm...
I am worried about is,
is that I don't think
filling the two barrels...
-I don't think it's
gonna be that easy.
-Yeah.
And then we won't have...
I think it's gonna
be something where,
if you and I did it,
we're just gonna be
exhausted afterwards.
Which I'm game for
for the tribe.
-Oh!
-Yeah, so that takes two of us
away to the water,
and we can prep for the shelter.
-I'm handy, so I got it.

Sure. No problem."

SARA:
Ooh, the mosquitoes are out.
You doing okay?
Oh... I think I messed up.

So, how long have you and
your wife been married, Genie?
I've been married for 20 years.
SARA:
Dang.
-That's so beautiful
to see and, like...
-(insects buzzing)
Yeah, I know, right?
And it's just
so incredible that, like--
it was kind of stigmatized,
right, like, to be gay?
And so I think
that's really important.
I was about 25,
and my now-wife proposed to me.
I have a very traditional
family.
So I knew the first thing
I got to do
is tell my mom, you know?
I thought she was gonna be
really upset with me.
She gives me a diamond,
and she says,
"I want you to give it
to Lindsey."
And I was so touched by that
because...
just from that gesture,
my mom was telling me
she accepted me.
She loved me for who I was.
And...
you know, she never said
those words to me,
but I knew it all
right at that exact moment.
SARA:
How long have you been married?
-RICARD: Six years.
-SARA: Oh, my goodness.
What was strange about it was
right before we met,
I was in the process
of fostering to adopt,
'cause I wanted to be
a single dad.
Okay.
I never, ever, ever wanted
to get married.
At the moment I saw him,
-he was catching a football.
-Yeah.
He had muscles.
-I mean, it was just awesome.
-Yeah.
And so we got married
37 days later.
-That's incredible.
-And now we have a daughter.
-No way. What's her name?
-Yeah.
-Aurelia.
-Oh, my goodness.
RICARD:
Being on Survivor,
it's complicated
because I'm leaving behind
a 22-month-old daughter.
She doesn't understand
why I'm gone
or that I'm coming back.
And my husband,
who's working a full-time job
while taking care of our baby
while also being a transgender
pregnant man...
I'm leaving behind a lot.
But if I won this money,
I would be able to know
that my children's
whole childhood up to adulthood
I could take care of them.
And so I'm here for
a really good reason-- to make
a really big impact on my life.
Yeah. Yeah.
DANNY:
Make sure we keep our eye
on that time.
DESHAWN:
Good thing is
we got plenty of time.
And if we find it, bro,
I'm not saying nothing
if you don't say nothing.
-Tell nobody.
-That's it.
DANNY:
I believe that me and Deshawn
have a pretty strong alliance.
We made some deals
while we were out here,
you know, trying to figure out,
you know, what we want to do
and how we can move further
in this game.
DANNY: And if you're gonna
look for an idol,
look for it on the first day.
DESHAWN:
If there's a clue out here,
we gonna find it.
SYDNEY:
What's going on?
SYDNEY:
Okay.
You want to talk about strategy?
-You know why?
-Why?
-They're looking for idols?
-Oh.
-ERIKA: What?
-SYDNEY: Really?
-NASEER: So...
-You don't think
they're gonna finish?
I know. These guys thinking
they can come back
being the heroes,
then take advantage of us.
Danny and Deshawn
potentially looking for an idol
during the water penalty
started waving
a few red flags for us.
ERIKA:
You know, thinking about what
can happen the next few rounds--
like, those guys could
save each other with the idol,
all of a sudden, like, they pick
off, like, "the weak people,"
then all of us
are screwed at that point.

EVVIE:
I really feel like the two guys,
they're gonna be so bonded
from doing this together.
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, totally.
Totally.
And I would go with
those-those guys, maybe.
-You know what I mean?

-Like, listen, as long as
it's not you or me...
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I 100% agree.

LIANA: I definitely think
Evvie right now
is my number one.
I don't know what it is,
but I just have
an inkling of genuineness
and authenticity with her.
-I work in a lab.
I'm a research assistant.
-Ooh.
What kind of research do you do?
So it's, like,
genetics research.
-What?
-Yeah.
EVVIE:
In the game, I don't think
I'm gonna tell everyone
that I'm doing a PhD
in human evolutionary biology
at Harvard.
I think that would make me
a big target.
But I've been studying
natural selection
and, you know, what survives
and what doesn't survive
my whole life.
So I'm really excited to play
the ultimate survival game.
ABRAHAM:
So, wh-what kind of game
you plan on playing?
I'm not gonna not be ruthless
when I have to,
but my most important thing
is, like, making
genuine relationships
with people and, uh,
work with them as long as I can.
-What about you?
-I figure this is a team sport
-until it's not a team sport.
-Yeah. That's exactly
how I feel.
ABRAHAM:
The first challenge that we had,
jumping off the barge,
we looked like a weak tribe.
If we don't win, we vote.
-It's so hard
in every challenge.
-EVVIE: Hell yeah.
ABRAHAM:
Winning stops the voting.
And if I can't win,
I need to find a fall person.
Yeah. (scoffs)
Dude, I did see that. Yeah.
-I mean...
-Yeah. We're good.
I looked at that paddle--
it was just floating away.
EVVIE:
Yep.
ABRAHAM: She could've at least
brought the boat closer.
EVVIE:
I hear you.
LIANA:
He's really about keeping
the tribe, like, strong.
And he was saying,
when you were in the boat
in the challenge,
you were just sitting there
-and you let the paddle go away.
-No, I didn't let
the paddle go away.
-I put four paddles in...
five paddles in the boat.
-I know. Girl...
And I couldn't even get

I'm what they call a previvor.
My mother died of ovarian cancer
when I was 16.
I was a senior in high school.
And I had the genetic code
for that,
which was the BRCA gene.
I was one of
the first people in the U.S.
to make the decision
to have preemptive
double mastectomy
and oophorectomy.
And I knew that if I did
the surgery,
yeah, that was gonna not be
the best thing in the world
for a young girl
to have to do that.
I was only 32.
But they did find
the beginning of breast cancer,
so I saved my life,
and I was quoted
in the medical world
as a previvor.
Now I'm here.
So it's time
to take that title
and change it to "Survivor,"
and that's what I want to do.
SARA:
Why does it keep going out?

Coming out here,
I didn't want to be the guy
who's talking strategy
all the time.

it's you and me.

The pro to protecting your vote
is that, at next Tribal,
you don't have to worry.
And the pro to risking
your vote is that
you have this weapon
that can get you
out of a sticky situation.
What I gleaned instantly
from those guys is that
they want to play hard.
It's the prisoner's dilemma.
You've just met these people,
but you really don't know
how they're gonna respond
to something
that could benefit them
personally.
It's a high-risk,
high-reward situation.
Although an extra vote would
mean a lot later on in the game,
I know it puts a big target
on my head.
I don't think it's a...
a big risk for me going home,
but I don't want
to lose the loyalty.
Think, uh,
those guys will probably
protect their vote as well.
If I risk my vote
and I end up losing,
then I would lose my vote
at the next Tribal Council,
and I don't think the risk
is worth the reward.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna protect my vote.
At this point in the game,
that's probably
the smartest decision.

decided to risk their vote,

or two other people
played it safe and I risked it,

a prisoner's dilemma,

he'd get caught if he tried
to lie too much.

a huge advantage,
an extra vote at any time.
Like, we don't know what's
coming to us. That's amazing.

This is something that
we can do for the team,

my neck on the line for it.
With the way I was able

I didn't have to keep up

the little things
I changed and tweaked.

interesting that people love

get on the boat.
You know, we're cruising,
and I'm like, mmm,
and my hair's, like,
flowing through the wind
and I think I look amazing.
I look over, and then there's
two people in different boats
whose hair looks
even more amazing.
And we jump out the boat,
and we're like, "Oh, what's up?"
And, like, we're all stoked
to meet each other.
So, we have to do this trek,
probably a little over an hour,
and I-I led the way.
And so, yeah, but that's not
the end of it. Um...
There is this ship's wheel,
right?
Xander and Danny both had
the same thing,
and if one of us hits...
if one of us turns it
and it says "risk your vote"
and two people turn it
and say "protect your vote,"
someone gets an extra vote.
But if two people
risk their vote,
then they lose their vote
at the next Tribal Council.
If you lose a vote,
like, you're screwed.
-SHAN: So, what did you do?
-I protected my vote.
I didn't want to be the person
to just screw everything up,
you know, for myself.
I told them that
I protected my vote,
and I gave them so much
information that I don't think
I left room for them to believe
I was leaving anything out.
And I feel like everybody's
still getting to know each other
and, like, we kind of are...
it's-it's in that blurry
gray area so far.
I think they ate it up.
I really think I sold it
really well.

We're three days into
the biggest adventure
of your life.
-What's the vibe?
-(light laughter)
So, when we saw you on day one,
you asked us a question.
You asked us how we felt
-about "Come on in, guys."
-PROBST: "Come on in, guys."
-Right.
-RICARD: And the reality is
there was so much going on--
there's so much commotion,
cameras, my hair is messed up,
I'm half crying--
I don't have the capacity to do
what I'm really supposed to do,
which I regret.
I don't agree that we should
use the word "guys."
-Huh.
-RICARD: I fully agree
that we should change it,
whether it just be
dropping the "guys,"
changing it to something else.
I just don't really
agree with it.
Reality is Survivor has changed
over the last 21 years,
and those changes
have allowed all of us,
all of these Brown people,
Black people, Asian people,
so many queer people
to be here simultaneously.
PROBST:
Yeah. It's a great point,
and I got to say,
I love that you thought
about it more.
I love that you had the courage
inside a million-dollar game
in which standing up anytime
is risky
to bring it up again,
because I'm with you.
I want to change it.
I'm glad that was the last time
I will ever say it.
And realizing in this moment
somebody right now
is on social media saying,
"Oh, he caved,"
(laughter)
I'll probably never
read it anyway.
All right. I love that.
We just made a change.
From now on, it is "Come on in."
Okay.
I want to tell you about
a new twist at Tribal Council.
Gonna complicate the game
a little more.
(sighing)
If you go to Tribal Council
and you fear you are in danger
but you don't have an advantage,
you don't have an idol,
this is
the Shot in the Dark die.
Here's how
the Shot in the Dark works.
This die gives you the power
to decide not to vote
but instead reach into a bag
and draw for
a one-in-six shot at safety
that night at Tribal Council.
Low odds. It's like 17%.
But if you need a Hail Mary,
this will give it to you.
Comes with a big invoice--
you can't vote--
but if you think
you're in trouble,
what does your vote matter
anyway?
And this decision
will happen in private,
in the voting booth,
so nobody will know
what you've done
until just before
I read the votes.
Very new complication
to the strategy.
There's one in here
for each of you.
You can take these back
to your camp.
Deal with that later.
Sorry about that, JD.
That's a bad toss, man.
All right.
Let's get to your first
immunity challenge.
-(clapping, cheering)
-There's the immunity idol
right there.
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-(others whooping)
In the tribe stage of the game,
this is what you want,
because if this is at your camp,
it means so are you.
You're not going home.
For today's challenge...
...you're gonna race over
and under a series of obstacles
till you get to the sled.
You're gonna load your sled
with very heavy puzzle pieces.
Then two members at a time are
gonna move very heavy sandbags.
Once you've cleared the track,
you'll push the sled
down the track,
transfer your puzzle pieces
to a crate,
and then hoist them
to the top of a very tall tower
where two players will solve
a Survivor puzzle.
The first and only
the first tribe to finish
wins immunity.
(all groaning, muttering)
The two losing tribes
will go to Tribal Council.
Two people going home tonight.
In addition,
the two losing tribes
will have to forfeit
their flint.
You will get a chance
to earn it back
at the next immunity challenge.
I hope it's starting to sink in
this game is more difficult,
more dangerous.
You have to perform
every single day,
or you could be gone like that.
All right, give you a minute to
strategize. We'll get started.

The first immunity challenge
was quite difficult,

TIFFANY:
We all know it's Abraham
to begin with, right? SO...
Mm-hmm, but... okay, but this
thing-- this is the only thing.
Like, do you think people
are gonna be like,
"We got to keep
the tribe strong"?
And then, like,
try to keep Abraham?
You think... you think so?
I don't know.
VOCE:
So we're on the same page,
what does that mean?
-XANDER: We're thinking Tiffany.
-ABRAHAM: Tiffany.
I look at the first
challenge we did.
We jumped off the boat.
Who was where?
-Who was doing what?
-Yeah.
This next challenge,
physicality was in there.
-I don't remember where
she was at. I didn't see her.
-VOCE: Yeah.
VOCE:
This is a different Survivor.
The physical demand
that has been put on us
right now is intense.
And so, looking at it,
having strength
is an asset
while we can still preserve it.
-ABRAHAM: It's not personal.
I mean...
-XANDER: No.
Uh, nobody wants
to be the first one to go.
XANDER:
Yeah.
ABRAHAM:
My day-to-day,
I'm a cybersecurity analyst.
So I look at
different perspectives
of how to execute my job.
And the Yase tribe
as a whole is a great tribe.
So what we need to do
is just execute better
so we can compete in challenges.
We can't get that if we got
parts that are not as strong
or doesn't work together well.
I think, when we get rid
of Tiffany,
it's gonna make us stronger.
-It was a physical challenge,
and it's hot.
-Yeah.
ABRAHAM:
We're trying to get that stuff
where it needs to be,
and then you got a big-ass
41-piece puzzle.
EVVIE and XANDER:
Yeah.
EVVIE:
What are you thinking?
I'm gonna still go
with the same thing--
let's keep the tribe strong.
EVVIE:
Yeah.
ABRAHAM:
Tiff's short track record
shows that she's here,
but physically, she's not
gonna be able to help us.
-EVVIE: Yeah.
-We got to be able to compete,
or our tribe gets decimated.
All right, well, I think we all
agree to keep the tribe strong.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We just failed hard-core
in the last challenge, you know,
so the guys are thinking
we need Abraham.
And on the other hand,
the weak target
that's on the table is Tiffany.
But there's only six of us,
and I don't want to be
in a situation where
keeping the tribe strong means
getting rid of all the women.
Yeah. And the thing is, is that
I really do love Tiffany.
-I-I love her. Yeah.
-She-she's a ball of energy.
VOCE:
I'm just a little worried
about...
-...how sociable she is.
-Yeah.
EVVIE:
Right now, I'm trying
to convince my tribe
to vote out Abraham.
I think he's a really good guy.
I think he'd be great
to work with for a while,
but Tiffany is someone
that I want to go
really deep in this game with.
I would personally
go either way.
Like, there's pros and cons--
like, I think
Tiffany is more likely
to be, like, really loyal.
-Yeah.
-Maybe. Yeah.
-You know what I mean?
-That's true.
EVVIE:
I don't want to lose Tiffany.
She has been a very familiar
type of person to me.
We clicked, and we both
really want to work together.
Which puts me
in a really good spot.
-Tell me, tell me, tell me.
-Oh. Well, I just...
the more important thing...
'Cause we're all planning
on a little bit
being, like, strength or bust.
TIFFANY:
And you're all throwing
my name out there,
-and I'm letting it
be happening.
-EVVIE: Exactly.
Yeah, but you say that my name
is out there,
-and that's really unsettling.
-Scary.
I mean, of course. Of course.
I, like, really trust
my gut instinct
that it's gonna be fine tonight.
But I'm... you have the feeling
that this is Survivor
and this is where
people get in trouble.

to be overconfident.

She needs to go."
I'm not opposed to JD,
but not right now at our Tribal.
-SARA: Yeah.
-Here's... here's my hesitation.
SARA:
I'm thinking about using
my Shot in the Dark.
Any single one of us has
a one-in-six chance of immunity.

I'm excited,
but I'm also nervous

it could be me

puzzle piece.
I trust you to the end.
We go with Sara tonight...
SHAN:
But I feel like I have been
in every conversation...
RICARD:
We should get rid of JD.
SHAN:
...enough to get a sense
of what's going on.
Brad is wanting to do Sara,
and Ricard and Sara,
they want to do JD.

I'm at the bottom

I'm at the top

♪ ♪
First Tribal Council,
here we go.
♪ ♪
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,
dip it in and get fire.
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council because
in this game,
fire represents your life,
and when your fire is gone,
so are you.
It's about to be the case
for one of you tonight.
So let's just start big-picture.
Tiffany, the first hours
the first day,
you're trying to find our vibe.
What's our group?
Do you feel that
this is a tribe?
I do. I feel it's
a pretty cohesive tribe.
You know, we don't just exist;
we exist in harmony.
And you get to know somebody
from your heart.
I think that that's what we're
doing going forward in this,
even in this world right now.
We're starting to love
each other
and accept every one
of our differences,
and we're doing
a really good job
showing the rest of the world
that we did it in one day.
PROBST:
Abraham, the other big thing
that you guys
are dealing with is
the tribe is only six people.
-Yes.
-So when it comes to voting
somebody out,
what's the criteria?
We look at it as the strength
we have moving forward
will compel us to be able to do
and select the right person.
And it's not out of malice.
I mean, we're living the
life experience on Survivor,
but on the other side,
who we have and what we
put together for strength
is gonna be what we look at
and say, okay,
this will get us further
in the game.
PROBST:
Tiffany, Abraham's answer
sounds to me like somebody who's
played this game many times
because he said
absolutely nothing
-while saying many, many words.
-(Tiffany chuckles)
Right, that is very much
who Abraham is.
He's very good
at speaking in circles,
and you're not really sure
if you ever got an answer.
It's-it's like a magic trick.
Where I have the gift of being
friendly and loving
with everybody,
he has a gift of
being close with everybody
yet not saying a single thing
unless he absolutely feels
it's necessary for his game.
You know, Jeff, I can't change
her mind about that,
but at the end of the day,
here's what I bring
to the table.
I bring the stamina.
I bring the strength.
You know,
I'm coming to get it done.
PROBST:
Evvie, this is fascinating
because Abraham
hears somebody say,
"I don't think you make
any sense when you talk,"
and he says, "Okay, that's fine.
I know what I bring."
And the great thing
about this game is
he might be reading it right.
It's just irrelevant
what Tiffany thinks
about "my communication."
Or it could be Tiffany tonight
writing down Abraham.
"I hope you understand this."
(laughs)
EVVIE:
Yeah, there are about
to only be five of us,
and we definitely don't want
to get down to four.
So, I mean,
I think challenge strength
is extremely important.
PROBST:
Voce, the Shot in the Dark.
New twist.
Walk up there to vote,
nobody knows if you're
going to vote,
play your Shot in the Dark.
They don't know
what you're gonna do.
But it could mess everything up
if you draw that 17% shot
and you're safe.
16.7.
Thank you.
-(laughter)
-I love that.
I'm just glad I got close at 17.
I was guessing.
So, Mr. Math Expert, at 16.7%,
how does the Shot in the Dark
change the game?
Yeah, I think the idea of it
is terrifying
because if I'm in danger,
I'm gonna take that shot.
But at the end of the day, if
you think through it logically,
I don't think it's actually
as scary as what it is.
Liana, that is
the kind of answer that,
if somebody said it to me,
I would think,
"I should probably take
my Shot in the Dark.
That sounds like they're trying
to get me off the scent."
Yeah, if you are somebody
that feels like you are
on the minority,
you get this sliver of power,
and so that can cause
a ton of chaos,
you know, whether that be
a revote or somebody that's
top dog in the majority alliance
is suddenly gone.
Like, it can completely
stir up the game.
PROBST:
Xander, how will tonight's vote,
if it goes the way
you think it's gonna go,
make this tribe better?
I think that this tribe has
gotten a bitter taste of loss,
and maybe the other tribes
see us as something less,
but I want to be able
to show them
that we're not a David tribe.
This is a strong tribe
that works together
really, really well.
Somebody from the David tribe
won that season.
-Right.
-That's true.
-PROBST: Evvie,
how about for you?
-EVVIE: As everyone's saying,
we're really cohesive as it is,
and I really think that we'll
leave here even more cohesive.
If we leave this Tribal
strong as a tribe,
able to do everything
we got to do around camp,
able to win in challenges,
we'll be so much better off
for the later part of this game
when we, like, critically
will need each other,
you know, just as we do now.

such a good headspace
for the next couple days.
I think we got fire in, like,
the first 30 minutes
and, like, we built our shelter.
It was a beautiful space,
honestly.
RICARD:
We have not fought.
No one's had anger.
It's, like...
-"Kumbaya."
-...really weird.
And not like the fake "Kumbaya,"
where everyone's in
a honeymoon phase.
-We genuinely are just chill.
-SHAN: Mm-hmm.
And yet you're gonna
vote somebody out.
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Beautiful part
of the game.
BRAD:
Jeff, we would trade you
a machete
and our last pot if you'd just
kind of let us stay
as a family tonight.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
-(laughter)
-So, Shan,
yesterday,
one person from your tribe
had to leave the tribe,
get on a boat.
What are you thinking when you
have to make that decision?
Oh, well, like he said,
we are a very namaste tribe.
And so we're like,
"Let's get democratic,"
and we pulled rocks and...
JD knew that if he came
back here without any rice,
we're gonna know
you have an item,
we're gonna vote you out.
And that's why I said,
"Check my bag,"
at the very start--
'cause I did tell them
that I had a chance
to get an advantage,
and I told them
exactly what it was.
And to risk my vote
on the first vote?
I didn't think
that was very smart.
And so I told them my decision
to protect my vote, so...
SARA:
You do have to be skeptical
when someone shows back up
with nothing in their hands
when typically
something like this,
they have an opportunity
to get something.
You're taking the word
of someone you don't know.
-And I'm not saying
I don't believe him...
-JD: Yeah, yeah.
...but I'm just saying
you have to have
some skepticism in this game.
PROBST:
Let's talk about
today's challenge.
Looked to me, Sara,
that it came down
to one piece that was missing,
but it was a piece you needed
in order to continue.
What happened?
How'd you discover it?
Yeah, so we got, like, a pretty
good start on that puzzle.
Those pieces were
flying together at first and...
-You were in the lead.
-Yeah, we were in the lead,
and that one piece
connected the side
to the rest of the puzzle.
And, like, that's a mistake,
and that could have
been avoided.
In Survivor season 41,
there is no room
for mistakes like that.
You know, we just...
we're learning that this is
-a new era for real.
-GENIE: And also the fact that,
like, there's only one immunity,
uh, you know,
like, to-to win? Like...
-What is that, Jeff? I mean...
-GENIE: We. I mean...
-(laughter)
-SARA: Namaste.
PROBST:
That is why Survivor is
so compelling,
and the stakes are high
when you're on a tribe of six.
So regardless whether
it's Sara and Shan's fault
or they get credit
for stepping up doesn't matter.
Somebody's going home.
JD, what kind of criteria
starts kicking in for you,
in terms of...
What do you want to be
after tonight's vote?
Right, your-your mindset
fluctuates
because if you feel as though
you're on the bottom,
like, my criteria is very low,
but if you are
kind of running things
and you got
the best relationships,
now you have a little leeway.
You can choose
who you want to go home.
And so I think...
I think everybody
talked to everybody
at one point,
and-and I also think that...
-Does that concern you at all?
-JD: Yeah.
Yeah, that's terrifying
right there.
Maybe some plans are changing.
And that's what
I was about to say,
was that I think everybody's
name was thrown out
at least one time.
Okay, but mine was thrown out
to my face multiple times.
So, out of everyone here,
Brad comes over
and says, "Well, we think
it's got to be Sara or Shan."
Like, you know, we got to stay
strong, and it's like...
Are we about to make this
a live Tribal?
-SARA: I mean...
-JD: I'm down.
Like, we're already whispering
over here, and I thought...
I've heard that I'm
on the block tonight, and I...
BRAD: I just threw up
two names because,
though that was the puzzle, what
Jeff was talking about earlier.
I get it.
"Okay, those two are on the
block." You know what I mean?
And I-I try to...
play that straight, but...
GENIE:
I-I mean, it was...
-No matter whose name...
-Yeah, this is, uh...
JD:
Let's get it started.
RICARD: So the point I was
trying to make earlier, though,
the puzzle piece,
that's old-school.
We blame the people
who messed up, made one mistake.
But we need to work
with people we can trust.
RICARD: Maybe think about
future challenges.
Maybe names you throw out
and the paranoia you cause,
that's what I'm more
-paying attention to.
-SHAN: I'm with you.
Like, right now?
(splutters)
All right.
(groans)
JD: Jeff, it's funny because
when you see on TV,
you hear the conversations,
right?
But, like, once again,
I'm hearing different things
than what I was back at camp.
So either now or then,
people were feeding me bull.
-Mm-hmm.
-JD: Now I have to decipher
whether or not
what they said then was true
or what they say now is true.
I don't quite understand
the paranoia, man.
-JD: From me?
-BRAD: Yeah.
I thought we were tight.
-I thought we were cool.
-(JD stammering)
-I am.
-I am.
-I am.
-All right.
Wow.
Jeff, can all of us put our die
in our pocket right now?
Absolutely.
-Do you have it close?
-I already put it in my pocket.
JD:
Jeff, tonight's gonna be a...
a Saturday night at Las Vegas,
maybe, up there.
-We'll see what happens.
-Jeff, just take us
to the vote, please.
-PROBST: You're ready to vote?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, my goodness.
Okay, it is time to vote.
Ricard, you're up.

BRAD:
I dive right in there,
and sure enough,
here they come
right down the trail.
SYDNEY:
We were trying to learn
as much as we could from him
-so we could boot him.
-Yay!
XANDER:
You got to throw all you know
about Survivor out the window.
-Oh ... no.
-XANDER: This is a new game.
I feel really disappointed
right now.
I think my one regret would be
not using the Shot in the Dark.
But it's been my lifelong dream
to come on the show,
and even in
these short three days,
I feel like I've learned
that I can really do more
than I thought I could and, um,
maybe not to trust people
as much
as I thought I could as well.
