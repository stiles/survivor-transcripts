You want to dump

BRAD: I'm awfully nervous
about JD right now.
I thought we had
a pretty good thing going,
but, at Tribal last night,
he was not consistent,
and he was not predictable.
That was a loose cannon
going off.
And then, when I saw
my name on the parchment,
my heart dropped,
because it's like,








"Oh, boy, this could be it."
BRAD:
So, I'm sitting in camp,
and I see Ricard and JD
head out to get water.
It doesn't take two people
to get water, you know?
And so you know
exactly what they're doing.

immediately goes,
"Dude, I can take
the beachfront,
and I can beat 'em to the water.
I know I can."

And so I blaze down the beach,
come shooting over to the water.
And, uh, I kind of look around.

big old plump bush
just within ten feet
of the water hole, right?








And I just dive right in,
knowing I don't have
a lot of time.
So I dive right in there

get hunkered in there
as low as I can.
And I wait.
And sure enough,
here they come
right down the trail.

I don't know if I could even
trust Brad at this point.

you have the idols.

three guys in camp.
Two guys are talking
about a "he." That's me.

No, yeah, I'm pretty sure

in hunting game animals,
a lot of times
when you're close
you look at a game animal,

And so, I just
close my eyes and listen.
Last night, I felt really bad
about my position,

I feel better.
I feel a lot better.
BRAD:
JD has changed this morning.
He was so paranoid last night,
and now, all of a sudden,
he's relaxed this morning.
He's-he's calm.
It's, like, I think he must
have an idol in his pocket.
I know I kind of was, like,
being paranoid yesterday,
but there was no way
I was rolling that die.
BRAD:
They head off,

get back to camp
before they do...
no harm, no foul.

Brad is a little bit
unpredictable.
His wheels are turning,

Yes.

to go up to Shan,

I'm happy to do that.
-Awesome.
-Thank you so much.
-No problem, dude.
-I owe you something
in this game down the line.
No problem.
No, we'll just work together.
-That's it, you know?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EVVIE: I know. No, seriously.
DESHAWN:
This trek up this mountain
was surreal, to say the least.
But my dad taught me the
three Ds when I was growing up.
And that's discipline,
determination and dedication
gets you the win
every single time.
DESHAWN'S DAD (echoing):
Remember them three Ds.
DESHAWN:
Just knowing all the stuff
that my parents sacrificed
for me in my life,
I don't know, I just feel, like,
a responsibility and pressure
to do well, you know?
When I was in school, I actually
wasn't really that smart.
I tell people,
"I'm not the smartest person,
but I work really hard,
and I have zero quit in me."
So I decided
to become a doctor,
which is something
that's really far-fetched.
You know, Black men are
the smallest demographic
when it comes to
practicing physicians.
So, um, all that said,
being here is surreal because
it's like, you fight so hard
to live your career dream,
-and then you get the experience
of a lifetime to come out here.
-We did it.
DESHAWN:
Look at this.
So I think my parents,
they're gonna be really proud.
Oh, man. Who do you think
is gonna go home tonight?
There's... It's like...
I'd say it's kind of
up in the air right now.
-Yeah.
-Like, basically I've heard
-Xander is the nicest kid
in the world.
-Wow.
-And we need him for challenges,
obviously.
-Yeah.
-But he came here.
-Yeah.
-So, you know,
he might have an extra vote.
-Yeah, for sure.
So I think, honestly,
-I think it's p-probably
going that way.
-Probably gonna be Xander.
Which, everyone is gonna be
like, "You dummies.
-You need to win something."
-Right. "You need to win."
EVVIE:
I want Deshawn to know that
I'm someone he can work with,
and I want to try to give
him something to prove that.
But I don't really
want to give anything away
that matters too much to me.
Ready for me to solidify
our alliance even more?
Do you know anything about
how the idols work this season?
I don't have it.
I don't have it.
But I know how they work,
and it's crazy.
-Okay. Tell me, please.
-Okay.
Basically,
on each of our beaches...
I'll reveal some things but
mostly other people's secrets.
That's basically my strategy.
So I think it's probably okay
to reveal some
of Xander's secrets,
'cause it probably
won't even matter tomorrow.
I know who has it on mine.
-Xander? Yeah, okay.
-Xander. That's the other reason
why Xander's in trouble
on our tribe.
-So be careful,
'cause it's a big risk.
-Yeah. No, I'm careful.
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you for telling me that.
-Yeah, no, I got. I got you.
-You're-you're all good? Okay.
♪ ♪
All right.
"Risk your vote
or protect your vote."
EVVIE: My vote tonight
is extremely essential.
I've been gone from camp
all day,
and I need my vote tonight.
So I know, no matter what,
I'm gonna protect my vote.
And I also hope
that by protecting my vote,
I build some trust with Deshawn,
so that he could risk
his safely.
And I want to prove to him
that I do what I say,
and hopefully we are going
to be an alliance
moving forward in the game,
and that we can use
that extra vote together.
All right.
(birds squawking)
Yeah.
-LIANA: Evvie!
-VOCE: What's up?
...that thing is brutal.
Okay, let me fill you in.
And we did the decision thing.
It was...
XANDER:
Is it still "risk your vote"?
It was the exact same
that you said.
I was pretty confident
that he was gonna risk his,
so I protected mine.
So that's it.
I need to fill up my water
bottle if anyone wants to come.
-TIFFANY: I'm coming.
-Okay.
Coming back into camp,
I had no idea what to expect
because being away
from everyone else at camp,
you never know
what's going to happen.
-TIFFANY: Voce is scrambling.
-EVVIE: Yup.
EVVIE:
But whatever. It doesn't matter.
-Right?
-But wait a minute.
I know. I...
I... That's what I think. Right?
The only thing. We haven't...
We haven't won
-a freaking challenge anyway.
-Okay. Good. I'm down.
-Okay. And then we'll deal
with the fallout later. Okay.
-Yup.
EVVIE:
Us three girls are secretly
gonna blindside Xander.
He's vulnerable.
We could get that idol out,
we could get
that extra vote out
and have three women
in charge of this game.
And I just have to try
to make sure that the boys
believe that I'm with them.
VOCE:
Yeah.
-We've got to win. Yeah.
-I know.
So you guys are thinking Tiff?
I'm fine with that.
So Tiff? Okay.
And that protects me.
Hold on. It's-it's
whether or not he has the idol.
No, it's not. What keeps us here
today, tomorrow, no matter what?
-Just... just...
-The only way to protect me.
Listen.
If he has the idol,
the only way to protect me
is to put Voce's name down.
What does that tell you? I...
Listen, I know you want him out,
-but it has to be Voce.
-I know.
That's what I think.
There's a lot of things
going on right now
that I can't even
keep it all straight. Xander has
some sort of idol that he has to
come together with other people,
and I still am unclear if he has
one or doesn't have one.
Listen, he's savvy.
He might even be lying to Evvie,
unless I'm being one of those
stupid Survivor players,
which I really hope I'm not.
EVVIE:
Okay. Okay.
...butterflies in purple...
I read the note, dude.
I read the note.
It said that he had to say
"butterflies in purple"?
Yes. Yes. I read the note.
Because his idol doesn't work
yet, remember? His idol...
-Remember?
-Okay, because here's the thing.
EVVIE:
I don't think he has an idol.
Just in case, even...
'Cause...
EVVIE: Out of nowhere,
Tiff starts panicking.
She got a vote last time.
She knows
she might get a vote this time.
But I know for a fact that
Xander really can't do anything,
but Tiffany wants to vote Voce.
Liana, are you okay with it?
I know. I know you're not.
-I know you're...
I know you're...
-No.
EVVIE:
Now I'm having second thoughts
on who I really want
to work with in this game,
and the thing is,
Xander really, really,
really trusts me,
and that's huge.
Hmm. Yeah.
-LIANA: No.
-EVVIE: On this group of five,
I'm in the middle and will be
deciding who goes home tonight.
This is the craziest day
of my life, like, for real.
And no matter what happens,
Tribal's going to be insane.
(quietly):
The players are about
to walk in.
It could be a crazy Tribal.
It's either tribe strength
or alliance loyalty,
but somebody's going home.
♪ ♪
All right, so before
we get into it, I just want
to commend you guys because
you're vulnerable out here,
and you let us see you
at your best
and sometimes
your not best moments,
and that's what makes it
so compelling.
Starting with you, Tiffany,
because you had
a tough day in the challenge.
-I did.
-What is it like
just being vulnerable?
TIFFANY:
I'm not good at that.
I like to do my best.
I like to give 100%,
and I like to win.
But out here,
I've learned that
I can't be happy and social
and play this game on zero food
and no sleep.
And when it comes
to the challenge,
I think I can do it, but
I, at one moment, thought,
"I'm just gonna lay down
and I just hope nobody sees me."
And so, you want to give up,
but you can't.
-PROBST: Really,
the lesson is...
-TIFFANY: Yeah.
...Survivor will humble you.
Xander, you're a young guy,
you're physical,
you should be athletic,
but I'm sure
you've been humbled
out here already in five days.
XANDER:
Yeah, this is all raw,
this is all
real, and it's happening live,
you know?
I'm not sitting at home on
the couch watching and thinking,
"Oh, Xander's making
a great move."
No, I'm here, and
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Voce, how about for you?
Yeah, part of this experience
has been super humbling
because I'm used
to being in an environment
where you have to succeed.
In the operating room,
if you make a mistake
where you cut an artery,
that is devastating.
But one of the most
important things in surgery
is that you review your error
so that never happens again.
And we're, right now,
a tribe that's on life support,
and somehow we have got
to figure out where all
the bleeding is coming from,
because it's not stopping.
PROBST:
I have a question for you.
When we were talking
about Shot in the Dark,
and I said, "One in six,
roughly 17%,"
-and you said, "16 point..."
-16.66667.
PROBST:
Okay, did you know that already,
or were you doing that
in your head?
I knew the answers
to the fraction already.
Where does that come from?
As a kid, were you smart?
-What was your story?
-I actually was not smart
growing up as a kid.
My mother instilled in me
this mantra of,
"Whatever you do, work hard
and work to the best
of your ability."
She was a single mom
after my dad died.
She was raising me
and my sister.
She had to get up,
get us ready for school,
go to work, provide for us
as best as she could,
come home
and do it all over again.
And so it's all credit
to my mom for giving me that,
just that drive
where I want to succeed.
PROBST:
So, Liana, how do you
manage that
when you're at camp
going, "Well, we lost,
and we lost.
Therefore..." blank?
Yeah, you know,
like Voce was saying, like,
we're trying to find that
artery, where are we bleeding?
And everyone's version of where
we're bleeding is different.
That's what's so beautiful about
this game. We're a microcosm
of the real world, and we all
think about things differently.
But you just don't know
until you're up there voting
-what's going to happen.
-PROBST: So, Tiffany,
it would be very easy
for these four to say,
"Love you,
but you killed us today."
That had to go
through your head.
This is not
some shocking revelation.
Not at all. Not at all.
I absolutely
expected my tribe to think that.
But Survivor is not just
about challenges.
It's a social game,
and I'm really
banking on the fact tonight
that I've created bonds
and spoken to people enough
to know they're not going
to blame just me
on this one vote.
PROBST:
So, Evvie, Tiffany
is pitching the alliance portion
of this.
Give me the reason why
that makes sense in this game.
EVVIE:
Obviously, we'd want
this remaining
group of people
to win a challenge,
but we don't even know
that we're gonna be
in a challenge with this group
of people ever again.
You know, we could very well
swap tomorrow,
and then it would be
almost irrelevant
what everyone's individual
challenge strengths are,
and it would matter much more
what everyone's
individual relationships are.
On the other hand, if we do have
another challenge tomorrow,
none of us want to go down
to three people and enter,
you know, a merge
that far down in the numbers.
So it's really a balancing act
between those two things.
PROBST:
Xander, there's never a right
or wrong answer of,
should you be tribe strength
for challenges, or
loyalty strength for alliances?
It's just,
where is it going to go based
on the group of people?
XANDER:
I mean, you're totally right.
It's juggling chain saws,
whether you want to focus
on loyalty,
or is it someone who can help
get you further? I mean,
every person in this game
should be trying
to just get to the next day.
Because this game is
unpredictable,
and that's what makes it
so beautiful is that
you never know what's coming.
Like, there could be no swap.
This is truly
"drop the four, keep the one."
We should start fresh
and just consider
that, you know,
whatever gets us to the next day
is something
that's good enough.
All right, it is time to vote.

Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm loving all the twists
and all the turns
and all the danger.
LIANA:
I was right there,

Maybe that's
my million-dollar mistake.
JD:
Ricard could have the idol,
you know. I still
haven't found it!
SYDNEY:
This is a very dangerous
season of Survivor.
I'm scared.
But I really am scared.
They got me good.
It's a big letdown
to be out this early
in the game.
I think I came into this game
with a mistrust of people,
and I instantly put my trust
in a couple of people
and didn't make sure
that my relationship-building
was going well
with the entire tribe,
and ultimately
that was my downfall.
No regrets. This was
an adventure of a lifetime.
