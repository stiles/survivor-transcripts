For the first five days,the
Men's tribe was on a roll,
Dominating every challenge.
even though this is one
World,as far as I'm concerned,
We here in charge of this game.
Leaving the women of Salani
hanging on by a thread.
is there any way we could
Possibly have an ember?
I'm sorry,I'm a republican,I
do not believe in handouts.
But the women Weathered the
storm with Back-to-back victories.
the women win immunity!
things are starting to feel Different.








But even rewards and Sunshine couldn't
keep them from Each other's throats.
what is it going to
take to Work together?
It's guys versus girls and Christina is playing
that side And playing us at the same time.
She's poison.
Facing their first Tribal council,
the mismisfight Alliance targeted
mat,the head Of the muscle alliance.
Matt**
But colton was harbor ago Personal
vendetta and wanted to Take out bill.
bill is the type that will Slit
up behind you and slit your Throat.
we know that.
so you need to eliminate that First.
you're gutter trash,that's All you are.
I can't stand him.
At tribal council,The misfit alliance decided
mat Was a bigger threat and he was Sent home.








time for you go.
First vote,first blind side,Game on.
15 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
♪♪
get***
getting back from tribal is Little
upsetting because matt Went home.
These guys don't know
what They're doing.
Most of those guys are weak and They
want to keep the weak guys Around.
You have the old guy,you have To little
guy,off gay guy who Doesn't want to work.
If they want to vote out the Strong
guys they can continue to Lose.
that went well.
yeah.
here's the thing real Quickly.
Mike is so peripheral,he has no Clue.
We can let him float a little
Bit before we vote him out.
It was good for us that we had To go to tribal
council because I truly felt the five of us were Solid.
The five are myself and
troyzan,Jonas,colton and lee.
We stand solid at the moment
for At least the first round.
So the next guy is billy,Because he's the
one most likely To pull somebody away from us.
good call.
bill's very dangerous.
He's capable of loosening the Ties that bind
us five with his Charm,his beguiling character.
he's a smart cookie.
yeah,and he's dangerous.
oh,yeah,I believe that.
so tomorrow we're solidify That idea.
okay.

good morning!
are you exciting looking at
Your good hearty breakfast?
good old snails for Breakfast.
The women have had a huge Turnaround.
We won the last two challenges
And we're not starving.
I mean,really and truly between
Coconut,snails,and the rice,
We really could probably
go on For 31 more days.
I mean,I could.
It's mind over matter.
oh**
snails
th****
nice.
We stkpwr * we're pretty Sophisticated.
okay,so did you guys use That net yet?
yeah,we tried to use it Yesterday.
if you guys want...
I'm from Hawaii.
I'm telling you right
now,I've Used a net before
and I know Exactly where to lay it and
when To lay it and how long to lay It.
so here's what we're Proposing.
If we could use the net we're
Willing to give you half of it.
isn't that funny?
I just think it's hilarious at
The beginning it was us Struggling
and now the boys come By wanting
everything we win in Challenges.
It's just crazy how much the
Roles have reversed in nine Days.
I know I probably sound like A
coldhearted bitch and I'm not.
But we can't be feeding our Enemies.
if you don't want to do
it,We're fine with that.
We're getting enough food as it Is.
But it would be a lot
easier for Both of us.
Think about it,we're doing all The
work and you're getting half Of it?
I don't really care either way.
you don't care either way?
I think jonas is a real rude Dude.
He made the offer with the net And
then kept saying I mean,I Don't care.
I don't care.I don't care.
But obviously he cares a lot.
it would just be a lot
easier For both of us.
You guys can think about
that And get back to us.
the women,they're trying to Be
such hard-noses,I don't get That.
I don't know if their emotions
Are turning them whacky
or what But they're emotional creatures
And they can't seem to think Straight.
don't think I'm a bitch!
Well,you just made a bitch Move.
So they're doing nothing.
They can sun tan on the beach While we
go fish and bring them Half of the food.

tell it sucked all the air Out of them.
I didn't care.
Tarzan was over with his crusty A s talking
about it's just Luck,it's just luck luck These.
so what they got a tarp.
the challenge itself
was kind Of a fluke.
we didn't have enough
time to Learn the game.
neither did they,though.
it's pretty much dead even.
They have a tarp; we have a Tarp.
the game is not
easy,dude,We're up one person.
I will take one person up over
All the doughnuts in the world.
to be honest,we got our Butts kicked.
These women aren't slouches so We
need to stop thinking about Them
as just some chicks over There because
the momentum and oh,we've won three;
they've Won three that's
out the Window,man!
we just need to win these
Immunity challenges,breaux.
I know.
Those chicks are tough.
Those are some serious Competitors,man.
for sure,definitely.
I'd love to find an idol.
yeah,me,too.
That'd make me feel so much Better.
I'm definitely glad to
Actually be able to talk to you.
When colton said to vote for You,I
didn't really want that,You know?
colton said that?
yeah. Yeah.
and... Don't tell him that.
I won't. I won't.
and then everyone came to the
Decision that it should be matt
Because,I mean,we didn't Really
know where your head was At
and,I mean,we're all
on the Same page now.
boys and girls,bill just got Wowed.
Turns out my name was way
more On the chopping block
than I Thought it was at
the last Tribal council.
Well,you know,that's
what Happens,breaux.
bro.that's the name of the game.
Name of the beast.
This changes everything,now That I know
the gloves are off And it's anybody's game.
just keep everything
between Us,you know?
if I find an idol,bro,I'll
Let you know,I swear it.
I saw leif talking to bill
And,like,they were a good Conversation.
I swear to god it's that guy Leif,man.
that little munchkin is about
To get knocked back to oz.
Where is he?
Call leif over here.
hey,leif.
Colton wants you.
The misfits are running
the show Right now.
I think there's a target on my
Back so I need to do something
And colton and I were talking About leif
because I see leif as Working all sides here.
So I brought leif into the mix Just
to add one more cushion in Front of me.
did you tell bill that he was Next?
did I tell bill?
yeah.
I was just trying
to...I Didn't tell him.
I didn't straight up tell
him,Yeah,we're voting for you,bro.
what'd you say?
I'm giving you a chance right Now.
If you told him,tell me,and
I'll try to do what I can.
But if you lie to me again...
What did you tell him?
I didn't even say that.
what did you say?
okay,yes,I did.
- you told him?
- I apologized.
you told him we were after Him?
You pretty much sealed your Fate.
It's a tight race between leif And bill for
who is the most Wishy-washy player in this game.
Bill's more sneaky whereas
leif Is more stupid.
He's turning into an
annoying Little oompa loompa.
Do you understand that
no one Here trusts you?
I know.
you are digging your own Grave.
I know. I just...
well,I told you to pick a Side
and you picked the wrong Side.
today I put the biggest
Ultimate foot in my mouth
and Right now everybody
has really Lost trust in me.
I really hope that I can somehow Regain that
because if not I Could possibly be going home.
I really did it this time.

oh,my god,bill you're going
Home next,that doesn't matter.
the four of us went over...
bye.
there's s clearly friction
Between me and colton
so I went To have a chat with him man to Man
and he decided he didn't Want to talk about it.
And nothing gets me more Frustrated
than when somebody Does not want to talk.
when I don't like someone
I Don't want to see them,
I don't Want to talk to them,like
I Don't want to be around them.
I don't want to be around you.
Period.
So don't follow me.

listen you little stuck
up Brat,I'm telling you.

No,no.

I absolutely hate bill.I hate
his voice.I hate his jokes.
He's not funny.
Like,you know,I'm a standup Comedian.
Shut up.
Get a real job.
You are disgusting.
I hate him.
I want his head on a platter.
I want him gone.
Bill just attacked me
like got Up in my face.
Like started yelling at me.
Leif told him that he was next.
that's what leif said?
what a bunch of knuckle Heads.
bill is a crazy person.
I hate him
maybe I should go to Those girls
and say do y'all Want to trade
and we'll go to Tribal council
because we have More to deal with.
that would be interesting.
would you be willing?
Because here's the thing...
I Know y'all want to go
to the Merge with numbers
but if you go To the merge with numbers
that Aren't on your side it doesn't Matter.
that's a...
I've never heard Of anyone doing this.
We just won immunity and Colton's
saying we should give It away.
And I'm thinking what?
This is a huge move,dude.
but it's a smart move in the End.
I don't like that idea but at This
point colton's calling the Shots.
So what am I going to say,no?
If I do that,colton might
put a Target on my back.
we can give the girls Immunity and go
to tribal Council and vote out bill.
say what?
yeah.
shut up!
honestly.
This is going to be the
smartest Move for us because...
wait,wait,wait.
I think that's a hasty decision.
leif told bill he was getting Voted out.
Bill goes crazy.
So now colton's like let's give The girls
our immunity idol and Vote bill out right now.
But leif is a loose cannon,too.
He's working both sides.
let's think about it for a Second.
Yeah.
- listen,buddy...
- I agree.
Let's give...
we've got to go in now and do That.
when a group of men get Together and make a
pact,you Betray them,that's a breach of Faith.
So we have to do something about
This and we've got to do it Tonight.
we're thinking of letting you Guys
stay and we go to tribal Council.
why?
we have a betrayal.
what happened?
they want to go to tribal.
are you joking?
nope.
oh,my god!
they've really lost their Mind.
all right,listen,leif,I'm
Sorry,but what you did is Egregious.
You should not have done that.
That was bad.
And the best thing to do is give The
girls the idol and go to Tribal tonight
rather than Smolder about it
for god knows How many days.
wait.
When we go to tribal
council,What is going to happen?
we're going to vote leif out.
tarzan gave this huge speech About how he's sending
leif home But I thought colton wanted to Vote out bill.
So I'm like what in
the world is Going on?
what do you think all of us Should do?
I truly am sorry,guys.
I mean I just want to
be 100% You w you guys.
you have betrayed us.
That means you will not be Trusted and you will be,whether
You vote on this tonight or not,Bull the first to go.
it's amazing.
I mean,they've got drama
in Their house after a win.
I don't care.Let them fall apart.
I would love not to
go to tribal Council.
the manono tribe has
Absolutely lost their marbles.
They're not a tribe.
They're not working together.
Which is great because if they Do this,it gives
the salani Tribe that big boost that we Needed.
okay,might as well vote.
We all have to agree on it Because
you can't do it unless We all agree.
who wants to go to tribal
Council raise their hand.
I do.
Come on.
How about you,bill?
man this game is crazy.
But if I vote with the rest
of The group to go to tribal
and Vote leif off well he's in
hot Water and people are angry,
that Serves my purpose immensely.
I'll have you guys know I am
Completely bum-puzzled right Now.
I don't know what to make of This.
the guys are very confused Right now
But I've always been able to get People
to do what I want and I Want bill gone.
I'm running this entire show Right now.
If you can't see
that,you are Helen keller.
just know this,no Foolishness like
that would ever Go down in this tribe.
- Ever.
- no way.
I just hope we don't have to Go
to tribal and vote somebody F.
24 seasons,some 400 tribal Councils.
Never had a tribe arrive at Tribal
council after winning Immunity.
What happened today,troyzan?
You're at tribal council!
The one place you do not
want to Be in this game.
well,what happened was
Everyone got together and agreed
To give the immunity to the Girls because
as a team we Wanted to vote bill out.
But leif basically said bill We're voting you
out so he kind Of broke the trust of everybody.
It was like you just
committed,Like,the cardinal sin to us
and So as a group we
said that can't Happen.
You have to go.
So leif was a member Of your alliance.
yes.
He was in on it and Went and blurted it.
yes.
So leif you blurt This out and
then all hell rains Down on you.
yeah,I'm definitely a guy
That just tries to play
with my Heart on my sleeve
and it bit me In the butt.
Playing with your Heart on your sleeve
doesn't Mean giving up
information from An alliance.
well,I know bill and I have Definitely been
getting closer On like a more friend level
and That's what it was.
I mean,he asked and I told him.
And you understand Strategically
how dangerous that Is.
yeah.
I mean right now I'm
pretty much Going home.
But by putting myself up
for Elimination I really hope
that It proves to the guys that I
Still have integrity within our Group.
Jay,why is it so Urgent
to give up immunity?
Why not just say all right,Next time we
have to vote Somebody out,leif,it's you ?
you know,when I first heard Of this it
went over my head Like are you guys kidding?
We demolished our enemy and
you Want to hand over the idol.
But you said yes.
I did.
If I don't go with the majority
I could be the next one to go.
I'm not trying to put a target On my
back so reluctantly,yes,I said yes.
Bill,what are the Chances that this will go down
As the single dumbest move ever In this game?
Dumber than somebody giving
up Their individual immunity.
This is a tribe!
Eight people agreed to do this!
I mean,this could be
the Single dumbest move.
I mean,you don't know until it Plays out
but there's no point In going into a merge
if you Have somebody who can't be Trusted.
Colton,where did This idea first start?
When did you hear about it?
when we realized that
leif Had told bill,
like,I'm the Type of person in this game
that If I don't like you
I'm not Gonna talk to you.
Like,I will just ignore
you,Like leave me alone.
Who don't you like in This game?
bill.
Why don't you like Bill?
he's obnoxious,he's loud.
And,plus,he's a
struggling Standup comic.
I don't get what your Correlation is.
like,get a real job!
Wow,bill.
honestly,I love the kid to Death.
We just come from two
totally Different backgrounds.
- but the thing about it is...
- wait,you just spoke.
Give me a second.
Me and him come from two
Entirely different backgrounds.
I'm not here trying to make it This
whole black white thing or Whatever.
I'm just talking about the Differences
in our upbringings,You know what I mean?
I've been on my own since
I was 17 years old,man.
Me being poor,that's just my Life.
When you're a struggling stand
Up comic,that's what you do.
You don't make very much money,You sleep on
people's couches And you go from gig to gig.
The truth is,that's what I do.
So colton,tell me About
where you come from.
alabama.
I mean,I live a town of 3,000 People.
And,yes,I did go to a
private,Like,all-white school.
But I do have,like,african
American people in my life.
Who?
My housekeeper!
so,I mean,like,that just Put
us on a weird vibe from day One.
but she's,like,a member of Our family.
A paid member.
yes.
I mean,you know...She
doesn't Work for free.
But I don't have a problem with
Bill because of his race at all.
The problem I have with bill is
That he's poor pitiful me I'm Poor.
Like,I don't associate with
People like that in the real World
and I'm sure as hell not Going to
associate with people Like that out here.
So being a standup is Not a
legitimate profession in Your eyes?
no,it is a legitimate Profession
but having a backup Plan.
Like,don't live off
the Kindness of others.
are you out of your mind?
Bro,you haven't worked an Honest day in your
life or had To actually go out and get a Job.
You're going to sit up here and
Tell me that me pursuing my Dream,
something that I love,Which is
comedy,I don't want a Fallback plan.
That's what I want to do with my Life.
- okay...
- hold on.
That's what I want to do with my Life.
Don't judge me.
I don't judge you.
So don't look down at me.
Don't call me names.
And for the love of god I work
With people and for no one.
You got that?
whatever,bill.
Kohl on the,are There
any groups where you live
That look down or maybe judge
The fact that you're gay?
I'm sure there are.
But the people that I associate
With,yeah,y'all can say Country club people,
whatever,I Feel like they
have more Educated thoughts
and ideas and They're more
open and accepting To things.
The ones who have a problem with It
are the ones riding around in Their,
like,jacked up chucks With the
rebel flags hanging in The back
and they go home to
Their trailers at night.
Tarzan?
all I want to say is this Conversation has
devolveed into A number of social platitudes Unfair
to both guys and as far As I can tell
colton's been Painted in the wrong light,
Which is easy enough to do.
What light is that?
well,he's been painted as a Rich kid
that never had to lift A finger and...
Painted by who?
okay,here's the deal.
The whole thing about race irks Me.
I think it's time to quit
Talking about (bleep)ing races.
I'm fed up with people
talking About race!
I'm tired of it!
I want people to base what they Think
about somebody on how they Behave
and what their merits
are And nothing else.
I don't care what color they Are.
That's how people should do.
And I think this country
is Moving in that direction.
We have a black president!
That's what I think.
It's very interesting What's
developed here tonight.
The differences that you guys Bring
into this game are a very Big part of
what will either get You to the end
or end up getting You voted out
as is going to be The case tonight.
You two may never have
met in Normal life.
never.
but you're here today and
the Only way to get to the end
is Either with each other
or Through the other.
And regardless how this vote Comes out,
this tribal council Will go down as one of
the Craziest in the history of this Game.
It is time to vote.
Jay,you're up.
I don't like you.
I'm never gonna like you so
Please take your broke ass home.
I'll go tally the Votes.
If anybody has the hidden Immunity idol and you
want to Play it,now would be the time To do so.
Okay.Once the votes are
read,the Decision the final.
Person voted out will be asked To leave
the tribal council area Immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote,leif.
Bill.
Bill.
Two votes bill; one vote leif.
Bill.
Three votes bill; one vote leif.
Bill.
Four votes bill,one vote leif.
Fourth person voted out
of survivor:One world,
bill,That's five,that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Bill,the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Well,voluntarily giving up Immunity
will go down as one of The biggest
and riskiest moves
Ever seen in this game.
Time will tell if this one pays Off.
Grab your torch,let's head back To camp.
Good night.
survivor
NSeason 24 Episode 04
Next time on survivor ...
all hail to the queen!
Colton's reign Continues.
what's the plan?
I could be colton's bitch,I'll
Be whatever you want me to be.
But a twist knocks Him off his throne.
Before we get to the Challenge...
oh,my god!
I just thought beep!
my tribe is doing some
very Unorthodox things.
But since I was probably next
on The chopping block anyway,
I Came to tribal
council to roll The dice.
One day colton will be
put in a Situation where
he can't just Not like somebody because
They're not people that he's Used
to or that he's grown up With.
He j**
