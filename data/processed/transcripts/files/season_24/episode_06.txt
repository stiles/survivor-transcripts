        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": DROP YOUR BUFFS
BECAUSE WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.
OH, MY GOD.
Jeff: IN A SURPRISE SWITCH,
MEN VERSUS WOMEN WAS NO MORE IF
YOU ARE BLUE, YOU ARE A SALANI
MEMBER.
IF ARE YOU ORANGE. YOU ARE A
MANONO MEMBER.
THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE MIGHTY








AND SCRAWNY WAS UNDER WAY.
COME ON!
Jeff: OH, MONICA TAKES A
HARD FALL!
THIS COULD DO IT FOR SALMONELLA.
SALANI WINS REWARD!
AFTER LOSING THE AWARD
CHALLENGE, THE NEW MANONO TRIBE
WAS BANISHED TO A NEW BEACH
WHERE THEY STRUGGLED.
I KNOT ON A TRIBE OF PEOPLE
WHO SUCK.
Jeff: CHELSEA, JAY,
TROYZAN, AND KIM QUIETLY FORMED








A MAJORITY ALLIANCE.
BUT KIM WASN'T DONE YET.
SHE FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
THAT SHE TOLD CHELSEA ABOUT,
CEMENTING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER HOW THIS
COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER
FOR ME.
Jeff: GO!
WHEN THE MANONO TRIBE LOST A
BRIEWFTAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE--
SALANI WINS IMMUNITY!
COLTON WENT TO WORK, TARGETING
MONCARKS HIS BIGGEST THREAT.
WE'RE VOTING OUT MONICA.
MONICA HAS TO GO NEXT.
TODAY YOU WILL SEE THE BEST
BLINDSIDE EVER PLAYED.
MONICA'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.
ALL HAIL TO THE QUEEN.
Jeff: AND AT TRIBE,
EVERYONE VOTED FOR MONICA,
EXCEPT FOR CHRISTINA AND SHE
QUICKLY REALIZED SHE WAS OUT OF
THE LOOP.
MONICA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
WITH HER ONLY ALLY GONE, CAN
CHRISTINA HOLD ON?
13 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
I'M FREEZING TO DEATH.
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT WAS THE
FUNNIEST TRIBAL COUNCIL I'VE
EVER BEEN TO.
( LAUGHS )
MONICA, WOW.
WOW.
OUR FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL WITH
THE NEW TRIBE COULDN'T HAVE GONE
ANY BETTER.
WE GOT MONICA OUT.
ORIGINALLY, I HAD AN ALLIANCE
WITH THE GIRLS, BUT REALIZED
THERE'S NO POINT IN KEEPING THEM
ANYWAY.
THEY WERE GOING TO GO ONCE WE
MERGED.
SO I WOULD RATHER JUST STICK
WITH ALL THE GUYS.
I TOTALLY DID NOT EXPECT THAT AT
ALL.
WELL, THAT'S CALLED A
BLINDSIDE.
IT IS WHAT IT IS, SO--
AND THE THING IS, LIKE, NO
ONE'S GOING TO GO OFF WITH YOU
BY THEMSELVES, CHRISTINA.
SO GOOD LUCK.
YOU MIGHT MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH
A HERMIT CRAB AT THIS POINT.
I DON'T REALLY CARE IF CHRISTINA
KNOWS SHE'S GOING HOME NEXT.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN SAVE
HER.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL AND
SHE'S GOT FIVE PEOPLE GUNNING
FOR HER.
THE MORE DEFEATED SHE IS, THE
EASIER SHE WILL BE TO GET RID
OF, AND AT THIS POINT, I STILL
HAVE MY IDOL SO I'M GOING TO RUN
THIS GAME UNTIL I'M ALL THE WAY
AT THE FINAL THREE.
HONESTLY, CHRISTINA, YOU'VE BEEN
THIS COCKROACH.
LIKE, YOU'VE SURVIVED THINGS
BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT--
YEAH.
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED.
I GUESS SO.
AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE
SUBJECT, IF BY SOME MIRACULOUS
MIRACLE, YOU DID MAKE IT TO THE
MERGE, YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE TO
GO.
LIKE, YOU'RE GONE BEFORE ANY
GUYS.
YOU'RE GONE BEFORE ANY GIRLS.
LIKE THE GIRLS HAVE ALREADY
SAID, LIKE--
YEAH.
SHE'S DONE.
I MEAN, IS THAT NOT THE TRUTH?
YES.
IT'S ALREADY DONE.
SHOOT, MAYBE I AM AN IDIOT,
AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
YOU NEED TO MOVE SO I CAN
SLEEP, TOO.
THERE'S TONS OF ROOM OVER
THERE.
NOT WHERE I AM.
WHY DON'T YOU SCOOT OVER.
IT'S REALLY INCONVENIENT FOR ME
TO BE, LIKE, ON THE EDGE.
I DON'T CARE BECAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA BE GONE.
I REALLY DON'T CARE.
YOU KNOW, ALICIA, IT'S BEEN
VERY DIFFICULT WORKING WITH YOU.
I'VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD TO WORK
WITH YOU.
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY
DIFFICULT PERSON TO WORK WITH.
I'M SORRY, I'M SLEEPING RIGHT
NOW.
SCOOT OVER.
PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY BODY I'M
GOING TO WHAT YOU CAN THE... OUT
OF YOU.
DON'T EVER TOUCH ME.
SCOOT OVER.
DON'T EVER PUT YOUR HANDS ON
ME BECAUSE I'LL WHACK YOU.
DO IT.
WHACK ME.
SCOOT OVER.
I THINK ALICIA IS GENERALLY
NOT A GOOD PERSON.
SHE HAS A LACK OF INTEGRITY, AND
COLTON IS A JERK, AND I'M GOING
TO LET OTHER PEOPLE SEE THAT.
ALL GLOVES ARE OFF AND I'M READY
TO FIGHT AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
HARD.
THAT WAS A ROUGH NIGHT.
DID YOU GUYS STAY WARM BY THE
FIRE?
IT'S COLD IN THE SHELTER,
MAN.
IT IS.
GOOD MORNING.
COFFEE?
I DIED LAST NIGHT.
ALICIA KILLED ME IN MY DREAM AT
THE MALL.
AT THE MALL.
YEAH.
I HAD A DREAM THAT I WAS IN
THE MALL SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES,
AND ALICIA KILLED ME IN MY
DREAM.
MAYBE THAT'S A SIGN.
MAYBE IT'S NOT.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I REALLY HOPE
SHE DOESN'T KILL ME SO THAT WAS
VERY SCARY FOR ME.
TREE MAIL.
TREE MAIL COMING.
YA!
WHAT HAVE WE GOT, HUH?
HERE WE GO.
"IF YOU WERE STILL A KID, YOU'D
PLAY IN THIS IN YOUR
BACKYARD, AND
IF YOU'RE STAFFERRING STORY OF
FOR SOMETHING SWEET I BET YOU'D
PLAY REAL HARD."
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DO YOU PLAY IN YOUR
BACKYARD.
TAG, DODGE BALL.
DODGE BALL.
THAT WOULD BE FUN.
WE GOT TREE MAIL TODAY FOR
SOMETHING SWEET.
SO THIS COULD BE CHOCOLATE CAKE,
IT COULD BE A BANANA SPLIT.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE COMFORT.
WHAT THE HECK IS THE GAME?
WELL, THERE'S BASKETBALL,
DODGE BALL, BASEBALL, CROQUETTE.
I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE TAG OR
SOMETHING.
SPIN THE BOTTLE.
HOP SCOTCH?
HOP SCOTCH.
SOMETHING SWEET.
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER TEAM IS
JUST A BUNCH OF MISFITS.
THEY'RE A GOOFY, GOONY CLAN.
I'M TRYING TO PLAY IT DOWN A
LITTLE BIT, BUT WE'RE KICKING
THEIR ASS.
I MEAN, BOTTOM LINE.
I'M EXCITED.
ME, TOO.
AND WE GET TO SEE WHO THEY
VOTED OUT.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
SALANI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW MANONO TRIBE.
MONICA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WOW.
THEY GOT RID OF HER.
MONICA WAS VOTED OUT AND THAT
JUST GOES TO SHOW THEY'RE GOING
TO PICK THE GIRLS OFF ONE BY ONE
BY ONE ON THE OTHER TRIBE.
BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MERGE,
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE
MINORITY SO WE'RE KIND OF
FIGHTING AN UPHILL BATTLE.
Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?
YES!
YES!
IS THERE ONE AT A TIME YOU WILL
RACE TO THE TOP OF A STACK OF
CRATES.
YOU WILL THROW A COCONUT,
BOUNCING IT OFF A TRAMPOLINE,
ATTEMPTING TO HIT A TARGET.
THEN YOU RACE BACK, AND THE NEXT
PERSON GOES.
FIRST TRIBE TO KNOCK OUT ALL
FIVE OF THEIR TARGETS WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
YES!
Jeff: ON A HOT DAY, WHAT
COULD BE BETTER THAN ICE CREAM.
Ã©
( APPLAUSE )
OH!
Jeff: THE WINNING TRIBE
WILL BE TAKEN TO A
"SURVIVOR-"STYLED ICE CREAM
PARLOR WHERE YOU WILL HAVE AN
ARRAY OF ICE CREAM FLAVORS.
YOU CAN MAKE SUN DISTRICT
SUNDAE, YOU CAN MAKE
FLOATS, YOU CAN EAT ICE CREAM
UNTIL YOUR STOMACH HURTS.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE.
Jeff: SALANI YOU HAVE ONE
EXTRA MEMBER, SITTING SOMEBODY
OUT.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
SABRINA, TAKE A SPOT ON THE
BENCH.
EVERYBODY ELSE, I'LL GIVE YOU A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO FOR AN
AFTERNOON FULL OF ICE CREAM,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
JAY AND COLTON UP FIRST FOR HIS
TRIBE.
JAY WITH A NICE TOSS JUST
MISSES.
A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE, LIKE
MOST OF THESE CHALLENGES.
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
COME ON, KAT.
THROW IT HARD.
Jeff: KAT GOING TO TAKE A
SHOT FOR SALANI.
DOESN'T EVEN HIT THE TRAMPOLINE.
ALICIA THROWS IT LIKE A LITTLE
KID.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY
THROW THESE THINGS IF YOU WANT
TO HIT THESE TARGETS.
TROYZAN NOW UP FOR SALANI.
JUST MISSES.
AS HARD AS POSSIBLE,
CHRISTINE.
Jeff: CHRISTINA JUST
MISSES.
THROW IT HARD.
THROW IT HARD.
THROW IT HARD.
YOU HAVE TO HIT IT HARDER.
RUN!
COME ON, JONAS.
Jeff: CHELSEA TAKES HER
TIME WITH A TWO-HAPPENEDDED TOSS
AND JUST MISSES.
COME ON, JONAS.
Jeff: JONAS JUST SHORT.
NO LUCK YET IN THIS CHALLENGE.
KIM GOING TO GIVE IT A GO FOR
SALANI.
KIM NOT MESSING AROUND.
A BIG TOSS AND SHE CONNECTS.
SALANI HAS ONE.
COME ON, TARZAN.
COME ON, TARZAN.
Jeff: TARZAN, IT'S AN
ADVENTURE FOR HIM JUST TO GET TO
THE TOP OF THE CRATES.
COME ON, MIKE.
Jeff: MICHAEL JUST MISSES.
TARZAN WITH A BIG LEFT.
AND TARZAN CONNECTS FOR MANONO.
WE ARE TIED 1-1.
Jeff: LEIF GOING TO GIVE IT
A GO FOR MANONO.
COME ON, LEIF, YOU CAN DO IT!
Jeff: LEIF TAKES HIS TIME
AND IT PAYS OFF.
MANONO LEADS 2-1.
THERE ARE FIVE TARGETS.
COLTON THROWS IT RIGHT BACK AT
HIMSELF.
Jeff: CAT JUST MISSES LAST
TIME ALICIA HAD NO PLUCK.
ONCE AGAIN, WAY SHORT.
MY NEPHEW COULD THROW IT FURTHER
THAN THAT.
COME ON, CHELSEA.
Jeff: CHELSEA WITH A
TWO-HANDED TOSS, AND SHE
CONNECTS.
COME ON, COME ON!
Jeff: WE ARE TIED 2-2.
COME ON, CHRISTINE.
Jeff: CHRISTINA SHORT.
RUN BACK, RUN BACK, BABY,
RUN, RUN.
RUN!
STUPID IDIOT!
COME ON, KIM.
Jeff: KIM HAS ALREADY
SCORED ONE.
CAN SHE SCORE A SECOND?
NO.
HUSTLE BACK.
HUSTLE BACK.
Jeff: JONAS WITH A BIG TOSS
BUT HE'S SHORT.
WHAT!
Jeff: JAY LEAPS TO THE TOP
OF THOSE CRAITS.
YOU GOT IT, JAY.
Jeff: JAY SCORES FOR
SALANI.
SALANI HAS THREE.
MANONO TWO.
COME ON, TARZAN!
Jeff: TARZAN STRUGGLING TO
GET TO THE TOP.
COME ON, TARZAN.
Jeff: TARZAN COULD TIE IT
UP.
TARZAN SCORES FOR MANONO.
COME ON!
Jeff: IT IS 3-3 NOW.
COME ON, LEIF, RUN.
Jeff: LET'S GO, LEIF.
EVERYTHING YOU GOT, BUDDY.
JUST MISSES BY AN INCH.
COME ON, KAT, CHUCK IT HARD.
Jeff: KAT SCORES FOR
SALANI.
SALANI LEADS 4-3.
ICE CREAM ON THE LINE.
COLTON, THINK ABOUT IT, AND
LAUNCHES.
Jeff: CHELSEA WITH A SHOT
TO WIN IT FOR HER TRIBE.
NO, IT BOUNCES RIGHT BACK.
ALICIA, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING.
AND THROW THIS THING.
COME ON, ALICIA, HARD, HARD.
OH!
Jeff: ALICIA, PATHETIC.
HARDER.
Jeff: KIM.
AIM IT, BABY, AIM IT.
Jeff: A BIG TOSS, JUST
MISSES OFF THE EDGE.
JONAS SHORT.
BURIES HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS.
A WASTED OPPORTUNITY.
HIT IT HARD, MIKE.
Jeff: MICHAEL WITH A NICE
TOSS BUT SHORT.
WE ARE 4-3.
MANONO, YOU'RE STILL IN IT.
CHRISTINA NEEDS TO GET MANONO ON
THE BOARD.
CHRISTINA, WAY SHORT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THROW
IT, MANONO!
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
Jeff: TROYZAN COULD WIN
IT RIGHT HERE.
AND HE DOES!
SALANI WINS ICE CREAM REWARD!
( CHEERS )
THIS IS OUR ISLAND!
SNAP, CRACKLE, POP, THAT WAS
BOMB.
Jeff: SALANI,
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: YOU WILL LEAVE HERE
AND BE TAKEN TO A
"SURVIVOR-"STATEN ISLAND ICE
CREAM PARLOR.
OH, MY GOD!
Jeff: WELL EARNED.
ENJOY IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD OUT.
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.
MANONO, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
CHRISTINA WAS JUST GRADUALLY
GOING THROUGH THE CHALLENGE.
IT TICKS ME OFF, YOU KNOW.
I'M JUST SO READY FOR CHRISTINA
TO BE GONE.
YOU CAN QUIT OR KUWAIT AND GO
HOME IN TWO DAYS OR YOU CAN JUMP
IN THE FIRE AND BE MEDEVACED,
WHICHEVER IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR
YOU.
SHE DRIVES ME INSANE.
I HATE HER VOICE, I HATE HER
VASE FACE.
I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.
I SMELL ICE CREAM.
AAHHH!
THIS IS CRAZY!
ALL RIGHT, GUYS!
OH, THERE IS A QOD!
THIS IS SO EXCITING!
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
COME ON, GIRLS.
PLACE AN ORDER.
ALL RIGHT, SO--
I'LL GO FIRST.
CAN I HAVE VANILLA AND CHOCOLATE
ICE CREAM WITH EVERY SINGLE
TOPPING ON A CONE?
WE SHOW UP AT THIS LITTLE ICE
CREAM SHACK RIGHT ON THE BEACH
AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALL YOU CAN
EAT.
YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF FLAVORS.
YOU CAN GET ALL THE TOPPINGS YOU
WANT.
WE KNOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE A
BUNCH OF GLUTTONS RUNNING
AROUND.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
THIS IS THE COOLEST ICE CREAM
SHACK I HAVE EVER SEEN.
CHOCOLATE AND MINT CHOCOLATE
CHIP, PLEASE.
OH!
WILL YOU STICK A CONE ON TOP
OF IT?
SO WE COME WALKING UP THE BEACH,
AND WE SEE THE ICE CREAM PARLOR,
AND HONESTLY, IT FEELS SO
SURREAL.
IT'S SO NICE TO EAT SOMETHING
BESIDE RICE AND COCONUT.
IT'S AWESOME.
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT BACK THERE?
I WANT TO GET EVERY SINGLE
ICE CREAM FLAVOR.
THIS IS THE ONE TIME I'M GOING
TO GO ALL OUT.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS AMAZING.
OH NO!
I GOT IT, I GOT IT, I GOT IT!
I'M GOING TO GET A CONE ON
TOP OF MINE, TOO.
I WANT TO SAY, TOO, THAT WAS
THREE WINS IN A ROW.
OUR MORAL IS SO HIGH IT'S GOING
TO CARRY US TO IMMUNITY.
CAN SOMEBODY PINCH ME?
IS ASHTON KUTCHER GOING TO PUNK
ME RIGHT NOW.
OH, MY GOSH, THAT IS SO GOOD.
OH, MY GOD!
I HAVEN'T HADSODY IN FOREVER!
IT'S DELICIOUS.
JUST EATING FROM A SPOON IS
LIKE--
YEAH, NO MORE BAMBOO STICKS.
JUST TO GET AWAY FROM THE
CAMP,UN, JUST TO THE BREAK THE
MONOTONY OF EVERY DAY GETTING
WOOD AND FIRE AND WATER AND ALL
THAT CRAP.
IT JUST REENJIETZED US.
WE KNOW WHAT WINNING FEELS LIKE
AND WHAT REWARD FEELS LIKE AND
WE WANT TO KEEP DOING IT.
OH, MY GOD!
DAY 15, ICE CREAM SUNDAE.
I WILL NEVER FORGET DAY 15,
NEVER.
THE MANONO TRIBE WILL NEVER
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS
( BURB
(.
OH, NASTY.
AWWGUYS WE WERE SO CLOSE.
YOU SHOULD SAY, "THANKS
CHRISTINA FOR GIVING IT ALL YOU
GOT.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU HAVE TWO MORE DAYS.
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
YOU HAVE THREE.
YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LAST TWO
DAYS.
YOU CAN QUIT, OR YOU CAN JUMP IN
THAT FIRE.
WHICHEVER IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR
YOU.
RIGHT NOW, NO ONE LIKES ME.
I'M THE COCKROACH OF "SURVIVOR"
BUT MY PARENTS DIDN'T RAISE ME
TO BE A QUITTER, SO I'M NOT
GOING TO QUIT.
GOOD CHANCE YOU TALK TO ME
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES?
ALL RIGHT, WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO GO.
UPDATE.
I'M GOING, TOO.
OKAY.
COLTON AND ALICIA ARE KIND OF
INTERESTING IN THE SENSE THAT
THEY HAVE TO, LIKE, GET PERSONAL
AND BE LIKE, "NOBODY LIKES YOU."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE
THE POWER TO VOTE THEM OFF.
THEY KIND OF JUST WANT TO GET,
LIKE, ONE LAST TWIST OF THE
KNIFE IN AND JUST LIKE UNH!
WHEN YOU GUYS HAVE A CHANCE
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
STRATEGY.
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE THINKING
LIKE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE
ME NEXT.
WELL, HEERMS THE THING.
ALICIA ALREADY HAS AN ALLIANCE
WITH THE FOUR GIRLS OVER THERE.
AND IF YOU GUYS WANT TO WIN THE
GAME, IF YOU VOTE ALICIA OUT,
I'M NOT PART OF THAT ALLIANCE,
OBVIOUSLY.
YEAH.
SO, I KNOW I'M GOING TO GO,
REGARDLESS.
SO I'M JUST TELL YOU STRATEGY IF
YOU GUYS WANT TO KEEP THE GUYS
STRONG BECAUSE IF THERE'S A
MERGE, ALICIA WILL GO WITH
KAREN, CHELSEA, SABRINA, AND
KAT.
AS YOU KNOW, IT'S A NUMBERS
GAME.
SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I UPON
WANT TO THROW OUT THERE AND LET
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT.
IT'S POSSIBLE WHAT CHRISTINA
IS SAYING IS REALLY TRUE BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF
DETAIL ON ALICIA.
THAT'S MY ISSUE.
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW HER
STATUS WITH THE WOMEN ON THE
OTHER SIDE.
WHICH IS A HUGE RED FLAG.
SO THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY AS
FAR AS THINGS GOES AND
EVERYTHING.
SO.
I FIGURED I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE
RIGHT NOW, IT'S EITHER ME OR HE
HER.
AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
PERFECT.
I'VE BEEN STANDING HERETO WHOLE
TIME.
THAT'S FINE.
GAME OVER, GIRL.
GAME OVER.
YOU CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME.
YOU SUCK AT IT.
YOU'RE DIGGING YOURSELF IN A
BIGGER GRAVE.
I ALREADY KNOW I AM, SO I
MIGHT AS WELL SAY WHAT'S OUT
THERE, WHAT THE FACTS ARE.
THEN BE A WOMAN ABOUT IT AND
SAY IT IN FRONT OF ME.
DON'T WHISPER IT, OKAY?
WELL, FACTS ARE FACTS.
AND I'M JUST LETTING THEM KNOW.
FACTS ARE FACTS?
WHAT FACTS?
ALL YOU EVER TALK IS LIES.
ALL YOU EVER TALK ABOUT IT IS
LIES.
NO, IT'S NOT LIES.
YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE
GIRLS.
I DON'T HAVE A STANDING THERE.
IT'S A NUMBERS GAME.
THE GUYS WANT TO BE AHEAD AND
THAT'S HOW IT IS.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I HAVE.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY
THIS GAME.
BUT I DO--
YOU'RE GOING UP TO THEM
TALKING SMACK, LIKE, REALLY?
I'M NOT TALK, SMACK.
IT'S WHACKED.
YOU LOOK CRAZY.
CHRISTINA IS FOR ONE TELLING A
PARTIAL TRUTH.
I DO HAVE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE
GIRLS, WHICH JONAS DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW.
SO, YEAH, I'M GOING TO GIVE HER
A HARD TIME.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH PARANOIA FOR
ME AND I CAN'T HANDLE THAT.
I NEED TO BE IN CONTROL SO
THAT'S WHY SHE'S GOING.
I'M JUST STATING THE FACTS.
I'M DONE, CHRISTINA.
DONE, CHRISTINA, DONE WITH YOU.
HE SAID HIS BRAIN HURTS.
I JUST NEVER HAD A HEADACHE
THAT, LIKE, MY HEAD, LIKE--
WHERE IS YOUR CANTEEN?
YOU NEED TO DRINK SOME WATER.
I GAVE HIM SOME WATER.
HE MIGHT HAVE A TENSION
HEADACHE.
IT SCARED ME WHEN I WOKE UP,
I THOUGHT MY BRAIN-- LIKE
LITERALLY MY BRAIN-- I WAS
SLEEPING, AND I WOKE UP AND I
JUST FELT LIKE LITERALLY IT FELT
LIKE MY BRAIN HAD, LIKE,
ATTACHEDDED TO MY SKULL.
LIKE I THOUGHT MY BRAIN WAS
SWOLLEN.
AND I GOT THIS PAIN AND IT WAS
LIKE SOMEBODY HAD A KNIFE
CUTTING FROM MY BELLYBUTTON OVER
TO MY RIGHT SIDE.
YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
EATING.
IT'S A STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT.
THIS IS, LIKE, THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FROM HOME,
EVER, RIGHT, FROM ANYONE?
IT'S TOUGH.
COLTON HAS A TENSION HEADACHE,
AND HIS STOMACH HURTS, AND IF
SOMEONE IS SICK AND NEEDS HELP,
I'M GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM,
YOU KNOW?
I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY COMING
TO MY ADVANTAGE, TOO, AS FAR AS
STRATEGY GOES BECAUSE COLTON
WILL REALIZE THAT I AM ACTUALLY
A GOOD PERSON AND I'M NOT THIS
BAD PERSON THAT ALICIA PORTRAYS
ME TO BE.
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST
RELAX.
I LITERALLY THOUGHT I WAS
ABOUT TO DIE.
CHRISTINA JUST KIND OF STEPPED
IN AND TOOK ON THIS MOTHERLY
ROLE AND TRIED TO MASSAGE OUT
WHATEVER WAS GOING ON.
AND OF COURSE CHRISTINA'S GOING
TO DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING
TO SAVE HERSELF.
SHE WILL LITERALLY DO WHATEVER
SHE HAS TO, TO STAY IN THE GAME.
YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD,
COLTON.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
CAN YOU WORK WITH ME, BRO?
YEAH.
ARE YOU READY?
YEAH.
OH, YEAH, WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
BRO.
COME ON!
WHOA!
AHHH!
VICTORY!
WE HAVE THE COVETED FRUIT.
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE.
YEAH, YOU'RE DEHYDRATED.
THAT'S ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS
TO SEE THAT.
YOU BETTER JUST FORCE YOURSELF
TO DRINK WATER.
BECAUSE THE NEXT THING HAPPENS,
YOU GET FAST HEARTBEAT,
TACHYCARDIA, FEVER, HEADACHE,
KIDNEY FAILURE.
SO GO AHEAD AND DRINK SOME MORE
WATER, OKAY?
COLTON TOLD US THAT HE WAS
DEHYDRATED, HE HAD ABDOMINAL
PAIN, AND THAT HE HAD A
HEADACHE.
HE SENSED SOMETHING WAS WRONG
AND I KNOW THE SIGNS OF
APPENDICITIS AND GALLBLADDER AND
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
I KNOW ALL THOSE SIGNS AND
SYMPTOMS.
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU NEED A NAP OR
SOMETHING.
MAYBE A COCONUT WATER ENEMA.
YOU HAVE TO ASSUME IT'S AN
EARLY APPENDICITIS OR A MORE
ADVANCED APPENDICITIS.
OR IT COULD BE TOTALLIY BENIGN.
GAS, FOR INSTANCE.
I'LL GET MY CANTEEN.
I'M ACTUALLY SEVERELY
DEHYDRATED.
LIKE, MY PEE IS BROWN AND, YOU
KNOW, I'M DIZZY AND I DON'T
KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M TO THE POINT
WHERE I'M SO FAR GONE AND
THERE'S NO COMING BACK OR WHAT'S
GOING ON.
IT HURTS.
I WALKED OFF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I
HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, I
CAN'T HOLD ANYTHING DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
LIKE, IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE THIS
INTENSE PAIN, AND IT LITERALLY
FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT A
KNIFE IN MY SIDE.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW
TO DESCRIBE IT, IS JUST LIKE A
KNIFE.
I'M DYING.
LIKE, I AM LITERALLY ABOUT TO
DIE.
I SEE COLTON ON THE GROUND,
AND I AM FREAKING OUT, THINKING,
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS WORSE THAN WHAT I REALLY
THOUGHT IT WAS.
I KNEW HE WAS IN PAIN, BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH IN SEVERE
PAIN HE WAS.
AND SEEING HIM ON THE GROUND
CRYING WAS AN INDICATOR TO ME
THAT HE NEEDS MEDICAL NEED
IMMEDIATELY.
HI, COLTON.
IT'S JEFF WITH THE MEDICAL TEAM.
HEY, COLTON.
Jeff: HOW YOU FEELING?
NOT GOOD, HUH.
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING?
I'VE BEEN HAVING, LIKE, PAIN
FOR A FEW DAYS, AND I THOUGHT,
LIKE, OH, I MOVE THE JUST HAVE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
BUT, LIKE, TODAY, LIKE I WALKED
OFF BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO SEE ME BECAUSE I
DIDN'T WANT THEM TON I WAS SICK,
AND THEN IT JUST GOT WORSE AND
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.
I TRIED TO DRINK WATER, AND I
JUST STARTED PUKING.
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON.
OKAY.
Jeff: RAMONA, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DETERMINE WITH THE
QUESTIONS?
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, I JUST
WANT TO DETERMINE WHAT IN HIS
STOMACH IS CAUSING THE PAIN,
WHERE IT IS, HOW LONG.
AND JUST FIND OUT IF IT'S
SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS.
IF YOU CAN, PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN
BY YOUR SIDE.
ALL RIGHT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,
I'M JUST GOING TO WARN YOU,
OKAY.
OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE FIVE
SECONDS.
I'M GOING TO PRESS IN, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO LET GO SUDDENLY.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF THE
PAIN'S WORSE WHEN I PRESS IN OR
WHEN I LET GO.
OKAY?
IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL.
HERE WE GO.
I'M GOING TO PRESS IN.
GOD.
AND I'M GOING TO LET GO.
WHEN YOU PRESSED IN.
HIS HEART RATE IS 105.
OKAY.
JUST RELAX.
YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR KNEES BACK
UP?
Jeff: SO COLTON IT'S THE
PAIN THAT JUST INCREASED?
SO THE HEART RATE WENT UP?
IT'S UP TO 120 SOOON
INDICATIVE OF SEVERE PAIN.
Jeff: HOW MUCH DID IT GO
UP?
DOUBLED.
Jeff: HIS HEART RATE
DOUBLED AND YOU WERE DOING THE
LIGHTEST OF TOUCH.
LIGHTEST TOUCH.
SO APPENDICITIS IS A VERY LIKELY
DIAGNOSIS HERE, GIVEN ALL THE
SYMPTOMS.
Jeff: COLTON, THE MINUTE
SHE MENTIONED APPENDICITIS, YOU
STARTED GETTING EMOTIONAL.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
Jeff: FIRST OF ALL, LET'S
GET IT OFFICIAL.
SO, RAMONA, OFFICIALLY, YOU'VE
RULED OUT CONSTIPATION.
IT'S BEEN SEVERAL DAYS.
HE'S GOT SEVERE PAIN.
WE'VE WATCHED HIS HEARTRATE
DOUBLE WHEN YOU WERE TOUCHING
HIM.
CAN YOU DIAGNOSE APPENDICITIS OR
CAN YOU JUST DIAGNOSE IT MIGHT
BE?
IT'S TOO RISKY TO NOT TAKE
HIM OUT AND INVESTIGATE IT,
BECAUSE IT CAN BURST.
Jeff: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM IN.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE
TESTS YOU NEED TO DETERMINE,
AND, COLTON, THAT MEANS IF WE
HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT AND TAKE
YOU TO A HOSPITAL, YOU HAVE TO
BE OUT OF THE GAME.
NO, JEFF, PLEASE, DON'T,
PLEASE, JEFF.
I JUST WANT TO PROVE THAT I CAN
DO THIS.
I GUESS I'VE DONE MY BEST.
I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
MORE.
Jeff: YOU STILL HAVE THE
IDOL?
YES.
Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO WITH IT?
OH, MY GOD.
CAN I GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY?
Jeff: THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO BRING
TRIBE OVER TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
GUYS, RIGHT ON IN HERE.
THEY THINK I HAVE
APPENDICITIS.
APPENDICITIS?
IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE
AND WORSE.
DOES IT REALLY HURT REALLY
BAD?
YEAH.
COLTON AND I ALWAYS TALKED
STRATEGY 24/7.
THAT'S ALL WE EVER TALKED ABOUT.
WE PLANNED AND WE PLANNED AND WE
PLANNED.
AND IF COLTON IS OUT OF THE
GAME, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT THAT PUTS ME
IN A REALLY BAD SPOT.
I MEAN, CALL ME A BAD PERSON,
BUT ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS
STRATEGY THE WHOLE TIME.
Jeff: SO THE RESULT IS,
THAT COLTON IS BEING PULLED FROM
THE GAME.
OH!
OKAY.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
GREAT JOB, BRO.
DON'T BE SORRY.
YOU DID GREAT.
GREAT JOB.
HE IS THE BIGGEST "SURVIVOR"
FAN, EVER.
Jeff: JONAS, YOU'RE REALLY
UPSET.
YEAH, I KNOW, I MEAN, LIKE,
IT'S JUST-- IT JUST KILLS ME--
I'M JUST PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS
POSITION AND IF I WAS HIM I'D BE
JUST HEARTBROKEN,UN.
Jeff: ARE THERE ANY LAST
WORDS BEFORE WE OFFICIALLY PULL
YOU FROM THIS GAME?
GO GET THEM.
I MEAN, Y'ALL KNOW WHAT Y'ALL
ARE UP AGAINST.
AND Y'ALL KNOW AN IDOL IS OUT OF
PLAY.
TELL SABRINA THANKS FOR THE
SOUVENIR.
I'LL LET HER KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT, COLTON IS A
SPOILED BRAT.
HE'S GOING TO KEEP THE IMMUNITY
IDOL FOR A SOUVENIR, EVEN THOUGH
HE KNOWS HE SCREWED ME, LIKE,
THE BIGGEST.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT
A STRETCHER COMING IN, OKAY?
LET'S BRING IT IN.
I VOTED OFF MONICA.
IF MONICA WAS HERE, THE GIRLS
WOULD HAVE HAD THE NUMBERS, AND
I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS POSITION.
SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT, SCREW HIM?
BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S IN
YOUR BEST INTEREST TO GO BECAUSE
YOU HAVE A LONG TRIP TO GET TO
THE HOSPITAL.
YOU'RE SO STRONG.
READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
THE ORIGINAL PLAN WHEN COLTON
WAS HERE TO GET RID OF CHRISTINA
FIRST.
BUT I FEEL LIKE NOW THAT I HAVE
A LITTLE MORE POWER IN THE GAME,
IT WOULD BE WISER FOR ME TO VOTE
OFF ALICIA, BECAUSE ALICIA'S GOT
MORE TIES WITH THE GIRLS.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE
ALICIA IN THE GAME.
SO COLTON LEAVING IS A HUGE GAME
CHANGER.
TAKE CARE, BUDDY!
I DO BELIEVE IF THERE WAS A
KARMA, COLTON GOT SOME KARMA
RIGHT BACK AT HIM.
( LAUGHS )
( LAUGHS )
TREE MAIL!
YEAH!
WHOO!
YOU READY?
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
"THE GAME CONTINUES ON, SO
DON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT.
YOU HAVEN'T WON.
YOU HAVEN'T LOST, BUT YOU WILL
GO TO TRIBAL TONIGHT."
WOW.
TREE MAIL SAID THAT BOTH
TRIBES ARE GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY
FINGERNAILS RIGHT NOW.
LIKE, ALL THE DIRT IS IN MY
MOUTH AND IT WAS NUTRITIOUS BUT
IT WAS DISGUSTING.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.
SO YOU HAVEN'T WON YET.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
CHALLENGE.
TRIBAL'S A CHALLENGE.
TRIBAL'S A A HEADACHE.
IS IT A CHALLENGE?
.
I DON'T THINK SO.
IT CONTINUES ON.
IT'S KIND OF NEUTRAL RIGHT NOW.
WHAT IF EVERYBODY GOES AND
EVERYBODY PICKS ONE PERSON.
YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR TRIBE OR
THE OTHER TRIBE.
IT IS ONE WORLD.
EVERYBODY PUTS A VOTE IN FOR THE
ONE PERSON THEY WANT TO GO HOME.
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION.
OUR TRIBE LIKES TO RUN ON AND
AND AND DEVELOP THESE FANTASY
THEMES WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I DON'T KNOW.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM
TO VOTE SOMEBODY OFF ON OUR
TRIBE?
YOU NEVER KNOW.
WE'RE GUESSING THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAN DO.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
IT JUST GOT DEEP.
RIGHT?
THE GAME CONTINUES ON, SO
DON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT.
YOU HAVEN'T WON, YOU HAVEN'T
LOST.
BUT YOU WILL GO TO TRIBAL
TONIGHT.
OH, SNAP!
OH!
WOW.
WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.
WE STILL HAVE TO GO TO
TRIBAL.
I REALLY THINK WE'RE JUST GOING
TO TALK ABOUT COLTON AND THAT'S
IT.
HOWEVER, JUST IN CASE, WE NEED
TO VOTE SOMEONE OUT, I MIGHT BE
THE FIRST TO GO.
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?
I WOULD BE YOUR FRIEND.
I'LL BE YOUR DAD AND MY WIFE CAN
BE YOUR MAMA.
DO YOU LIKE ME?
NO.
WHY?
ARE YOU MAD AT ME BECAUSE I
VOTED FOR YOU?
NO.
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE A
WONDERFUL GIRL WHO WILL BE VERY
SUCCESSFUL.
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE MY FRIEND.
UNDERSTANDABLE.
HE WOULD BE MY FRIEND.
JONAS WOULD BE MY FRIEND.
BUT I DO RESPECT YOU, KATRINA.
CHRISTINA.
RIGHT.
I ALREADY COMMITTED TO YOU
GUYS SO I'M LETTING YOU KNOW
THAT I'M GIVING 100%.
THE VOTE IS GOING TO YOU GUYS.
SO--
RIGHT ON.
I'M STICKING TO THE PLAN.
ALL RIGHT.
THE PLAN AS IT STAND RIGHT
NOW, CHRISTINA, MIEFL, LEIF, ARE
PLANNING ON VOTING OFF ALICIA.
BUT THE THING IS, TARZAN IS NOT
ON BOARD WITH THAT PLAN, BUT I
DON'T REALLY CARE.
BECAUSE I'M READY TO TAKE THE
BULL BY THE HORNS AND MAKE
MYSELF THE RING LEADER.
I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE WITH
YOU GUYS, ANYWAY.
IF YOU EVER FIND ME A THREAT,
VOTE ME OFF.
I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
STRAIGHT UP.
OKAY?
I APPRECIATE THAT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
HEY, LISTEN.
YEAH.
CHRISTINA IS VERY, I CALL IT
PSYCHOPHONIC.
SHE SUCTION UP.
SHE SAYS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO
TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO GO WITH
HER, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
SHE'S KIND OF DANGEROUS.
THAT'S HOW I KIND OF FEEL--
YOU SENSE THAT ALREADY?
WITH ALICIA.
NO, IT'S NOT SO WITH ALICIA,
HONEST.
IT ISN'T SO WITH ALICIA, NOT AT
ALL.
I DON'T KNOW, TARZAN.
NO, NO, NO, I PROMISE YOU.
IF WE HAVE TO VOTE, PLEASE DO
CHRISTINA, WILL YOU?
BECAUSE I WILL.
SHE WILL, AND IF YOU WILL.
COME ON.
LEIF, PLEASE.
I'M DEFINITELY STUCK IN
BETWEEN TWO HARD PLACES.
ON ONE SIDE TARZAN WANTS TO VOTE
OFF CHRISTINE, BUT ON THE OTHER
SIDE, JONAS WANTS TO VOTE ALICIA
OFF.
SO I'M REALLY STUCK RIGHT NOW.
I'M KIND OF PISSED ABOUT THE
WHOLE IDOL THING.
COLTON SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO
SOMEBODY.
I WAS HOPING THAT HE WAS GOING
TO GIVE IT TO ME.
BEING THAT NOW I'M STUCK WITH
CHRISTINA AND THE GUYS.
LORD KNOWS U, I NEED IT.
LORD KNOWS U, I NEED IT.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MANONO TRIBE.
WHERE'S COLTON?
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET ME
CATCH YOU UP ON WHY EVERYBODY IS
HERE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
COLTON WAS MEDICALLY EVACUATED
FROM THE GAME YESTERDAY.
HE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN.
AS MUCH AS HE WANTED TO STAY IN
THE GAME, AFTER EXAMINATION BY
OUR DOCTORS, THEY CONCLUDED IT
WAS ACUTE APPENDICITIS.
HE HAD TO BE FLOWN TO A HOSPITAL
TO HAVE SURGERY.
OH, MY GOD.
CRAZY.
WHAT IS THAT?
RIGHT HERE.
OH.
Jeff: IT'S VERY PAINFUL.
JEFF, I'VE HAD MY TAKEN OUT.
IT'S A LOT OF PAIN.
I WAS ABOUT 15, AND IT HURTS.
IT HURTS.
Jeff: TROYZAN, HOW DOES
THIS CHANGE THE GAME?
GEEZ, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
TO START.
YOU KNOW, I FEEL SAD FOR COLTON,
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH HE LOVES
THIS GAME.
I MEAN, THAT'S MY REACTION.
I'M SAD.
Jeff: AND YET, KIM, ANOTHER
PERSON OUT OF THE GAME, AND IT'S
NOT YOU.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
ANOTHER PERSON GONE IS ANOTHER
PERSON GONE.
Jeff: IS IT HARD TO SAY
THAT?
YEAH, I MEAN, I'VE HAD MY
APPENDIX OUT, TOO, AND IT HURTS
LIKE HELL SO I DO FEEL SAD FOR
COLTON.
HE WAS SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
CAN I SAY SOMETHING ON
COLTON'S BEHALF?
Jeff: SURE.
SABRINA, HE SAID THANK YOU
FOR THE SOUVENIR.
HE DID NOT GIVE ANYBODY THE
IMMUNITY IDOL.
HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.
SO...
Jeff: SO, SABRINA, THE FACT
THAT SHE MENTIONED THE IDOL
SPECIFICALLY, DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT, OR DOES IT RAISE SOME
SUSPICION?
MY GUT, I BELIEVE IT.
HE WAS REALLY EXCITED TO GET IT.
I DON'T THINK HE WANTED ANYONE
TO PLAY IT BUT HIMSELF.
SO UUHM--
SEEMS LIKE EVEN IF HE DIDN'T
GIVE IT AWAY THEY WOULD WANT TO
KEEP A SECRET SO I DON'T THINK I
BELIEVE IT.
I THINK SOMEBODY HAS GOT IT.
Jeff: JONAS WAS THIS A
TRIBAL DECISION TO COME IN AND
TELL THEM THESE CERTAIN THINGS?
I CAN'T REVEAL THAT
INFORMATION, JEFF.
Jeff: WOW, JAY, THE PLOT
THICKENS.
YOU KNOW.
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?
( LAUGHTER )
SHE IS SO FULL OF IT.
LOOK AT HER LAUGHING.
LOOK AT THE SMILE ON HER FACE.
I DON'T BUY THAT AT ALL.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
IN FAIRNESS TO ALICIA, HE DID
TELL HER, TO TELL THEM, WHAT SHE
DID.
SO SHE'S DOING WHAT HE TOLD HER
TO DO.
Jeff: MAYBE.
MAYBE.
Jeff: KAT, WOULDN'T BE THE
FIRST TIME IN "SURVIVOR" THAT
SOMEBODY LIED.
TOUCHE.
DEFINITELY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL SUSPICION.
I MEAN, THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
IT.
THEY COULD NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M KIND OF MORE WORRIED ABOUT
THE APPENDIX THING AND HOW DO
THE NOT GET MINE HURT.
EVERYONE ELSE HAS GOT THEIRS
OUT.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Jeff: SO LEAVE IT TO
COLTON, WHO EVEN THOUGH HE'S
MEDICALLY EVACUATED, STILL
LEAVES AN IMPRINT ON THE GAME.
AND THE GAME IS ABOUT TO GET
COMPLICATED ONE MORE TIME.
YOU CAN DROP YOUR BUFFS.
WE ARE MERGED.
MERGED?
WHOOO!
Jeff: HERE YOU GO.
TAKE A BUFF AND PASS IT AROUND.
PUT IT ON.
BLACK.
UNBELIEVABLE.
WOW.
Jeff: ARE YOU NOW ONE
TRIBE.
12 PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR A MILLION
BUCKS.
SO, TROYZAN, FIRST YOU FIND OUT
COLTON'S OUT OF THE GAME.
THEN YOU HEAR THERE MAY BE AN
IDOL.
AND NOW YOU FIND OUT IT IS AN
INDIVIDUAL GAME RIGHT NOW.
I'M ACTUALLY COUNTING NUMBERS
NOW, NUMBERS OF PEOPLE.
AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING.
AND WHO IS WITH WHO AND WHO IS
NOT?
SO THERE'S ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX, GIRLS,UN.
Jeff: WE'RE BACK WHERE WE
STARTED.
SIX MEN, SIX WOMEN.
YEAH, ERCHL HAS THEIR OWN
AGENDA.
Jeff: KIM, LOTS OF EYEBALLS
DARTING BACK AND FORTH.
AM I THAT OBVIOUS?
Jeff: NOT JUST YOU,
EVERYBODY.
YEAH, I THINK EVERYBODY'S
TRYING TO FEEL OUT THE PEOPLE
THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY ON A TRIBE
WITH, ARE THE WOMEN TOGETHER?
ARE THE MEN TOGETHER?
IS SALANI TOGETHER?
IS MANONO TOGETHER?
IS THIS GOING TO BE REALLY
INTERESTING?
Jeff: DOES THIS EXCITE YOU
OR MAKE YOU NERVOUS?
I'M EXCITED.
I'M NERVOUS, TOO, BUT IN AN
EXCITED WAY.
Jeff: TARZAN WHAT, IS GOING
ON IN YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW ABOUT
HOW THE GAME IS CHANGING?
I HAVE TO SAY THE GAME IS
AFOOT.
Jeff: ON THAT NOTE, HERE'S
HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.
YOU'RE GOING TO MERGE ON THE
BEACH WHERE YOU ALL STARTED.
ANY ITEMS FROM MANONO WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU.
YOU GUYS HAVE LASTED 17 DAYS.
TAKE A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE.
THEN GET YOUR HEAD BACK IN THIS
GAME.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR."
ALLIANCES ARE SHATTERED.
WHEN DID IT CHANGE AND WHY AM
I THE LAST GUY TO KNOW?
PLATFORM, YOU ARE SUCH A
CONFUSED -- TWO DAYS AGO I TOLD
THAT YOU PLAN.
STOP INTERRUPTING ME.
Jeff: AND TARZAN WALKS
ALONE.
I'M DROPPING MY ALLEGIANCE
WITH YOU GUYS.
I'M OUT OF IT WHEN I SAY
SOMETHING, I DON'T GO BACK ON
IT.
GOOD LUCK.
I THINK WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT
IT IS I'M SO USED TO GETTING MY
WAY AND, LIKE, THIS HAS NOT GONE
MY WAY AT ALL.
I HAD A PLAN COMING INTO THIS
GAME FROM DAY ONE TO DAY 39.
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO AND I
WAS GOING TO DO IT AND THIS HAS
THROWN A WRENCH IN EVERYTHING.
THAT'S THE HARDEST PART FOR ME.
I PROGRAM YOU I COULD RUN THIS
