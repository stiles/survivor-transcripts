Back at camp,leif leaked
Information to the enemy Alliance.
When.colton said to vote to You,I

Colton wanted to get Rid of bill.
we can give the girls Immunity and go
to tribal Council and vote out bill.
I'm like what in the world is Going on?
I'm completely bum-puzzled right Now.
I don't know what to make of This.








Everyone gave in,not Wanting
to go against the Majority.
At tribal council colton
Continued his attack on bill.
he's a struggling tandup Comic.
Like,get a real job.
me being poor,that's just my Life.
I don't know how to sugar coat It.
I don't associate with people
Like that in the real world

The guys are much more of a mess
Than what we thought,you know?
But I'm not going to question
Their nonsense over there.

the egg I said lord,Please let it be the same color As kim.
That's what I wanted.
welcome to our home,guys.
I smashed it it was blue; she
Was blue; chelsea was blue.
That's,like,our first
three in Our alliance.
Then I saw kat and I
was just Like oh,my god!
Is this really real?
maybe a slice with peanut
Butter and jelly on it?
oh,my god!
This is amazing.
I can't believe...
oh,my god.
...Four girls within the Five-girl
alliance on the new Tribe.
Priceless.
**
when I cracked that egg and I
Saw orange and I looked around
And jay was covered in
blue and Troy was blue
and I looked over And kim had blue and
sabrina had Blue and I just thought...
Beep.

Got water holders.
A lot more pots and pans.
everything's going to be Fine.
- I know.
- everything is going to be Fine.
We got a better house.

this is a better place.
soft sand.
not only did I get
on a tribe With people
that I don't want to Be on a tribe with,I
got on a Tribe with people who suck!
We're not going to be able to Compete
with them in anything,You know?
They're greek gods.
They're going to
dominate us in Challenges.
They're eating peanut
butter and Jelly sandwiches.
They're getting stronger
than They already are.
oh,my god,we are going
to Be the laughing stock.
We are not going to win.
I already know we're not going To win.
Even if the girls didn't have
The guys on their team at salani
They'd still probably kick our Butts.
That's how sad that is.
the prince and the princess.
will you be my prince?
will you be my princess?
Even though I can be a complete And total
evil person,I know How to relate to people.
I know how to charm people.
I know how to tell them
what They want to hear.
I know how to get them on my Side.
I want to give my loyalty to You guys?
- you promise?
- **
Pinky promise?
I don't want to get blindsided.
you're not going to get Blindsided.
You have to trust.

I'm telling christina

girls and You.We're set.
Honey,I'm not a liar.
okay,okay.I know.
I won't leave you now.
Don't forget,who's your mama?
Colton joined us and I felt like Okay,there's
power in numbers But I'm not sure.
I hope you're still with us.
I hope you're not the
puppet Master manipulator
and that you Really and truly aren't with the
Guys and us girls are going down One,two,three.
And I feel like I'm the Strongest of the three
girl Which is would mean it would be Me first.
***
just one right on the
other Side of that rock.
where?I don't see.
there's one right here,too.
- Did you get it?
- yup.
oh,my god!

That's it.
That's four.
This will be our lunch with p.B. And j.
We'll eat so good.Nice
dinner rice and more crabs.
screw fishing.
guys,gather around for this Load.
stay there!
Stay there!
Sabrina,close in over there.
mike,put your stuff down and Close in.
where is he?Where is he?
- Got him!
- yes!Yes!
today has been just Fantastic.
It reminded me back in 1979 when I played
cornerback for the Central valley bears.
Which way is he going?
Boom.I mean,it was total instinct.
That was it.Game over.
Sorry,chicken,you lose.
Holy crap!
- We got more.
- oh,my god!
we caught a rooster today.
Mike and chelsea got four huge Crabs.
good day of hunting.
salani,baby.
Salani.
it's like the gods said "come Together
and I will provide you With what you want.
" It's been wild!
hay,troy,do we have any Space between us
and the rest of The people in the ocean?
mike and kat are in the Ocean.
That's it.
we were thinking going into a Merge situation we want
to make Sure you have a solid four or Five people.
The boy in the ocean is not one Of them.
fine with me,dude.You know me.
I think it's salani
versus Manono right now.
I don't think it's men versus Women
and if it was we would be On the outs because
we're down a Man as far as our tribe goes.
They have one more girl.
I don't mind at all
working with These women.
I think I can trust them.
I want to get to know them Better
and see where their heads Are at.
what's chelsea like?
chelsea's great.
She hasn't been playing Strategy.
She's just kind of...
She's Game.
I trust her.
all right.
Whatever merge situation Happens.
Let's intermingle,weave our way Into it.
and when it comes time to
Vote we have to tell each other
What's going down and make sure That
it goes not towards any one Of us
and pretty soon we're in The majority
and it doesn't Matter anymore.
This has been my thing all Along.
I'm trying to keep my options Open so if
sticking with the Girls works best for me
I'll Stick with the girls.
And if we get to the merge
and Don't have the numbers,
troy and Jay are my
alliance all the way.
I can't get over how this could
Not have gone any better for me
And how much fun I'm having Doing this.
anybody else want to chew on That?
oh,yeah.
I thought it was going
to be Hard and a grind
and I know it Will have its
moments but this Is not one of them.
This is a good time.
I don't like this job.
{a6}**
I don't like having to trust
People that I don't trust.
well,we're going to have
to Try to trust them.
oh,I trust monica.
you don't trust christina?
no.
Not at all.
I don't,either.
I'm almost thinking-- don't You dare say
anything to monica About this,you swear?
swear.
we need to get out christina First.
we need four,though.
I'm telling you,we might be
Safer with tarzan and jonas.
I'm telling you. I'm telling you.
no.That's unstable.
That's why you guys had all
that Crazy stuff going down.
Leave it as it is.
The girls are loyal.
You guys are the ones who are Crazy.
I don't consider colton as a guy So I feel
like we have four Women against three guys.
But colton's crazy.
He really wants christina out
But I need to keep my women here
And get rid of the guys so that
When we merge I'm still there.
On thraoufrz cal...
Or at leaste In the mix.
so what's the story
between You and alicia.
I'm just talking to her.
you're in good with her.What's the plan?
**
I'm sticking with the guys,Honestly.
I can't afford to go with these Women.
while we're working busting Our ass building
a shelter,Colton is doing the same thing!
He's just sitting on his
ass Talking to alicia.
I'm like what is going on?
How...How does he get away with This?
I... It just... It's...
I never Thought to play that game.
It's brilliant.
they have to think I'm their Fourth.
But I'm not.
You have to trust me.
don't scam me bro.
- fist bump,I'm not.
- seriously.
I promise you.
half of me believes
him,half Of me is like...
He's like "I'm Such a girl.
" What is that?
Christina's going first?
yes,just remember to
write Her name down.
All right,good deal?
okay,sweet enough.
it's kind of like colton's Just running the
showon both Sides with the women and the men
But it would be rick ridiculous For me not to
think he's Aligning with the women right Now.
***
***14
sabrina finds the immunity
Idol but it's not for our tribe.
She gets to play it for one of The guys.
Nobody really had the girls'
Idol and something map ised for Me
and I thought I'm literally
Going to find this right now.
It's out here somewhere.
I walked all around the guy's Side
looked at every tree,Nothing,nothing.
I was getting discouraged
and Said,lord,please.
Thank you.Finally.
just found the immunity idol.
It's really,really good.
It feels amazing.
I've looked so hard so I had to
Literally reach in there and Feel it.
**
I just found the immunity
idol And it's in my crouch.*
you're lying.
I'm not.shut up!
Okay,are you ready?
holy cow!
Damn!
as soon as I found the idol
I've kind of been thinking
I Might keep it to myself
but as I Was trying to grab it
and get it I thought there's
no one I trust In this game more
than chelsea If I'm going
to do this with Anyone
it will be with her so I
Decided to let her in on it.
now that we have this
and we Can literally...
Like,this Could be a game
changer where we Take the numbers.
No one can know,not a word of It.
hell no.
and we need to be careful
They don't see us as a pair
Because the other one
would Never have an idea.
We just need to make sure that We have our
alliance with as Many people as possible.
This is awesome.
***
pull the thing.Pull
it! Pull it! Pull it!
slowly,slowly.
What are you?
we got a chicken! we got a chicken!
oh,my god!We are so fed!
look at that!we are so fed!
We're so awesome,guys!
How'd he get out?
these people suck at "survivor.
" I mean,let's just be honest.
They suck at "survivor.
" I think we're going to lose the
Immunity challenges regardless.
I don't think we have a
chance In hell of winning.
I guess we should have
Checked the sides of the coop.
that's embarrassing.
I think monica and christina Are both on the
outs but monica Has way more power than Christina.
Christina has no friends
on that Other tribe
and when we merge if Monica's at
that merge it's Going to be bad.
If christina's
there,it's not a Big deal.
She's going to be easy to get Rid of.
Here's the thing I
need to know From you.
This is just me and you talking,Okay?
okay.
monica's a hell love a
lot Scarier than christina.
agreed.
but monica has to go next.
so monica and then
who's next After monica?
christina.
If you...
but you're asking...
I'm just Saying,you
have to see it my Way.
I see it your way.
you are asking me to trust
a Whole other tribe...
no,I'm not.
I'm asking you to trust me.
One person who can control those Guys.
- okay.Deal.
- all right?
I just had to convince
alicia I Have her back.
I convinced her I was
like,Look,I'll take care of you,
we Have to take out
monica and Christina.
I will vote your way
but I Swear to god...
- you're not going to get Screwed.
- if you screw me over...
you can come to alabama and Kill me.
I've been getting rid of the Head

We got one on the board.
yup.
one point.
Put it here,baby.
good job,monica.
I'm sorry I let you guys Down.
you did more than any of us,Though.
well,now what?
today you will see an oscar
Performance from colton and I
For the best blind side ever Played.
Monica's going home tonight.
so if you guys are voting off A girl
tonight,please think About staying strong.
definitely.
so that we can win
the Challenge tomorrow.
I'm glad we're on the same Page.
And I'm sure she thinks
she's in A safe spot
because she did Score us a
basket but she's Going home.
**
And,hey,alicia is
following me Like a fiddle.
if following colton means
Voting out somebody else
and Getting me one step
further to The million,awesome.
I could be colton's bitch,I'll
Be whatever you want me to be.
But just don't vote me off.
we need to win.
I know.
so maybe we should
just get Rid of tarzan.
I think so.
I don't want to keep talking.
Tell monica that.
I wanted to say it and when
Alicia said it it was like cool,
That's exactly what I was Thinking
and tarzan at the Challenge today
looked like wash Ago wounded hippo
trying to walk Over to the water
so I think it Comes to a unanimous
decision That he just needs to go.
we need to get rid of tarzan.
yeah,that was a little
Awkward today at the challenge.
are you okay with that?
I'm cool with that.
that's literally what we just Said.
Literally.
because we have to win Tomorrow.
It's embarrassing.
don't tell tarzan but we're
Going to blind side him.
okay.
Just as long as it's not me.
Tell me what to do.
we have...I mean,we have to Win.
that's the thing.
this is one world,baby,this
Is one world.
we have to think like that.
Are are you inn.
yeah,if that's what it takes To
keep us unified,we've got to Do it.
the guys have lost sight
on The numbers game.
I mean,it's tarzan tonight.
In my mind I'm thinking that's a Huge win for the women
that the Men are on board to take out one Of the men.
we're all thinking that we've Got to get rid of tarzan
because He's kind of dividing the tribe Up right now.
all right.
Yeah.
And so... tarzan.
yeah.
all right,for sure.
tarzan. tarzan.
in a weird way,that whole Event
that happened with leif Telling bill
that he was going Home,that
sort of tipped me off
To being a little leery of leif
And not to trust him so much.
start blowing,somebody.
so leif is definitely a wild Card
and he did do some pretty Crazy things
and with four guys And three girls.
Anybody could flip on the guys Side and
just,you know,make it The girls game now.
this is what we have to do.
We're voting out monica.
so it's monica?
Now tell me who monica is again?
- pink bikini.
- yeah.
Oh,good.
Okay. Yeah,yeah.
she is the head of the snake,Do
you see what I'm saying?
And alicia said monica's trying
To play me,play you,play Everybody.
yeah,she is.
I've got alicia voting with
Us just in case you don't.
But you don't know that.
Y'all are on board?
yes,I agree you w you 100%.
please,leif.
I told leif and tarzan
basically This is the deal.
We're voting out monica but Tarzan
is almost like having a Grandfather
with alzheimer's and You have
to tell him something 87 times.
You have to keep repeating it,Repeating
it,repeating it Because he forgets it.
just remember,monica Tonight.
right.monica.
Just remember monica lewinsky.
wait a minute,wait a Minute...
Okay.
I have to make sure before we
Go to tribal council he knows
Who to write down or he could
Write down guinea for all we Know.
does this look okay?
yeah,you look great.
if I were working
with,like,Somewhat intelligent people
who Could kind of help
me out and I Didn't have
to make all of the Decisions
it would be so easy.
But literally it's really hard Being
the leader of a bunch of Idiots.
It's so difficult.
So let's talk about
This new manono tribe.
Jonas,what was your
reaction of Your new tribe?
well,the odds were not Stacked in
our favor,let's just Put it that way.
Monica,give me your
Input on this new tribe.
well,breaking up was hard to Do.
We'd gotten close,the girls.
But it's actually turned
out to Be a blessing.
Our beach is better,our food
is Plentiful and we've...
We're Playing like a team,I think.
Colton,do you like
Monica's positive attitude?
I mean,yeah.
If she thinks that she can turn This sinking
ship around,by all Means,honey,take the wheel.
We need monica.
Alicia,is it Possible that monica could be What
this tribe needs to help Turn things around?
um,I definitely think she's An awesome
person,amazing Person an amazing supermom.
She's very...
- Very competitive And very athletic.
- thank you.
and she can kick some ass.
I smell a "butt" Coming.
she can be seen as a threat.
That's the but.
that's the but?
that's the but.
but to say I'm a threat,it's More like I'm trying to
help the Team instead of trying to get Myself further.
But I could see how you
would Perceive me that way.
but she's one of the most Hardest
working women I've ever Seen.
well,good.That makes me feel happy.
Tarzan,what do you
Make of this new tribe?
Was it good news for you?
my immediate response was to Drop my
assertiveness to a Different load star,
which is One member of this group who Would
then lead the first few Days of this new tribe.
So that means...
- Hold On.
- okay.
I love this.It's kind of a game.
You decided to drop your Assertiveness to a
different Lode star which is one member of This group.
yes.
And that would be...
I shant say because the game Is afoot.
"I shant say"?
So you're not going To reveal because
we here in the Midst of the game.
yes,sir.
Leif,do you Understand what tarzan says?
He's got quite a vocabulary.
he definitely is a very Complex,very
wisdom kind of guy And...
Is it hard even to Talk around him?
Do you find yourself saying "I
Need better words than okay"?
yeah,he definitely
has a lot Of big words
that I can kind of Comprehend but
he also helps Better explainate...
See,better Explainate,not a word.
and what he said is a neo-low Jim.
Which is what?
making up the word that Sounds
similar to the word you Mean to say.
Awesome.
It's impressive,your Vocabulary.
- Not a lot of people have that.
- thank you.
But the need to share It and the
need to be heard can Be disruptive.
Do you ever sense that?
well,in my own environment
It's a thing we do.
We try to be very,very precise.
What is your world?
What have your shared with
your Group about your world?
the game is afoot,jeff.
So that remains a Mystery?
yeah.
I know you have 14 Pets.
I have 14 pets.

I have a nominal aphagia.
It's a specific aphagia for People's
names that I have had All my life.
I can't remember a person's Name.
It's called nominal aphagia.

Tarzan,just so I'm Clear,you weren't
putting me On,you were struggling.

first letter,we Might still be here.
possibly,if you waited that Long.
Well,after 14 days,Somebody
is about to be voted Out.
It is time to vote.

If anybody has a hidden immunity Idol and you
want to play it,Now would be the time to do so.

That's four,that's
enough.Bring me your torch.

Monica,the tribe has spoken.
Time forou to go.
Well,you admit the
other tribe Is stronger
and then you vote Out arguably your strongest
Member becse she was too big Of a threat.
Interesting strategy on only day 14.
