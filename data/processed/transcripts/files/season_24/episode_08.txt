        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR."
THE GAME BEGAN LIKE ANY OTHER.
IT IS MEN VERSUS WOMEN.
MEN VERSUS WOMEN, LIVING
TOGETHER ON
ONE BEACH.
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ONE
WORLD, TO ME IT'S THEIR TRIBE
VERSUS OUR TRIBE.
Jeff: THEN RANDOM SWITCH--








WE'RE SWITCHING TRIBES.
CHANGED EVERYTHING.
FOUR GIRLS IN THE FIVE-GIRL
ALLIANCE ON THE NEW TRIBE, PRICE
WILL.
Jeff: THE NEW SALANI STOOD
STRONG IN CHALLENGES AND UNITED
AS A TRIBE.
SALANI!
Jeff: WHILE THE MISFITS OF
MO MONANO WERE AT THE MERCY OF
COLTON.
YOU CAN QUIT OR JUMP IN THAT
FIRE, WHATEVER IS MOST








CONVENIENT FOR YOU.
Jeff: WHEN COLTON WAS
REMOVED BECAUSE OF A MEDICAL
EMERGENCY, THE GAME CHANGED ONCE
AGAIN.
LEAVING 12 SURVIVORS, SIX MEN,
AND SIX WOMEN, TO MERGE.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS
THEY THINK I CAN FIND THE
MAJORITY, ONE IS WITH MY OLD
TRIBE, SALANI, THE OTHER BEING A
POTENTIAL WOMEN'S ALLIANCE.
Jeff: WHILE THE WOMEN WERE
KEEPING THEIR OPTIONS OPEN.
TWO DAYS IEG TOLD YOU THAT
PLAN.
DON'T ( BLEEP ) SPRUPT ME.
Jeff: THE MEN WERE AT EACH
OTHER'S THROATS.
YOU ARE SUCH A CONFUSED
( BLEEP ), REALLY, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU.
I'M DONE TALKING WITH YOU.
Jeff: TARZAN ALSO FOUND
HIMSELF IN HOT WATER WITH THE
REST OF THE TRIBE
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT POOP.
IT'S DIRT I SWEAR.
I'M GOING TO PUKE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IF IT WERE UP TO ME, TARZAN
WOULD GO HOME.
Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL-- SEVENTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
IT WAS JONAS WHO WAS SENT HOME,
LEAVING THE MEN AT A 6-5 NUMBERS
DISADVANTAGE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
11 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
YOU KNOW, I BEFRIENDED JONAS
FROM THE BEGINNING, AND I'M
BUMMED BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE
LUCK OF THE DRAW.
IF JONAS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON OUR
TEAM SALANI, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
GOLDEN.
MIKE WOULD HAVE OVER THERE AND
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A
QUESTION.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE GOT STUCK--
PLAYING WITH KNUCKLEHEADS.
WE STARTED OUT MEN VERSUS
WOMEN, BUT WHEN THEY DID THE OLD
TRIBE SWITCH, ME, JAY, AND MIKE
MADE THIS PACT TO STICK WITH THE
SALANI GROUP, WHICH WAS CHELSEA,
KIM, KAT AND SABRINA.
I JUST HOPE WE DIDN'T MAKE A
MISTAKE.
THE NEXT DECISION IS EASY.
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A GIRL.
100% IT HAS TO BE A GIRL.
I'M REALLY SCARED AT THIS POINT
ABOUT THE GIRLS BEING TOGETHER
BECAUSE THEY COULD VERY EASILY
HOOK UP AND THEY COULD DO
DAMAGE.
HONESTLY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
OVERPOWERED BY THESE GIRLS.
OH, NO.
7-UP, BABY.
SOMEONE'S HAVING A PARTY.
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THAT WOULD
TASTE RIGHT NOW.
THE UNCOLA 7-UP.
HAVE INTERESTING TREE MAIL.
YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHAT IT LOOKS
LIKE.
OH!
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT!
7-UP, THE UNCOAL ABABY.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY?
YES.
YOUR GAME MAY BE GOING
DOWNHILL QUICKLY.
AND MUST SURELY HAVE YOUR HEART
RACING.
WHEN THE CRISP, CLEAN TASTE OF
VICTORY TODAY, AND BE REFRESHED
FROM THE STRESS YOU'RE FACING.
RIDING DOWN SOMETHING.
DERBY RACE.
THAT'S AWESOME.
WE ARE DEFINITELY DRINKING
SOME OF THIS.
I'M GONNA LOVE THAT.
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN
BREATHE IF I HAD A 7-UP,.
WOULD JUST BE DOWN IN ONE GULP.
I'M EXCITED.
FOR ME, THIS IS, LIKE, A
NECESSITY.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
THAT'S A SLIDE.
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO
BE A BIG WEDGY.
Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE.
YEAH!
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU WILL BE DIVIDE DWOOIDED UP
INTO TWO TRIBES.
ON MY GO, ONE AT A TIME YOU WILL
RACE DOWN A GIANT WATERSLIDE,
AND HEAD OUT INTO THE WATER
WHERE YOU WILL GRAB A LARGE
PUZZLE CRATE AND BRING IT BACK.
THEN THE NEXT PERSON GOES.
AS MORE TRIBENUMBERS COME DOWN
THE SLIDE, YOU'LL WORK TOGETHER
TO GATHER THE CRATES.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL SEVEN UP ON
YOUR PLATFORM, YOU WILL USE
THOSE CRAITS TO SOLVE THE
PUZZLE.
FIRST TRIBE TO GET IT RIGHT WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL BE TAKEN
TO A 7-UP OASIS.
OH, MY GOD!
Jeff: WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY
AN AFTERNOON BARBECUE OF
BURGERS.
OH, MY GOD.
STEAK.
Jeff: STEAK, KEY LIME,
LEMON MERANG PIE.
TO GO ALONG WITH IT, AS MUCH
CLEAN, CRISP, REFRESHING, 7-UP
AS YOU CAN DRINK.
THAT'S AWESOME.
O MIERKS GOD, IT'S SO GOOD.
DO WE GET, LIKE, A LITTLE
TASTE?
Jeff: I THINK YOU NEED I
TASTE.
YEAH.
YEAH.
Jeff: I THINK YOU NEED TON
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?
FOR.
EXACTLY.
Jeff: ONE BOTTLE TO SHARE.
WHO WANTS IT FIRST?
ME, ME, ME.
OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS SO GOOD!
MMM!
WOW.
OH, GOD.
OH, MY GOSH.
Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?
YES.
Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO DO A
SCHOOL YARD PICK, DIVIDE INTO
TRIBES.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE OUR TWO
TRIBES.
JAY, TROIZ AN, KAT, ALICIA, AND
CHELSEA TAKING ON MICHAEL, KIM,
SABRINA, CHRISTINA, AND LEE.
TARZAN, NOT PICKED, GONNA SIT
THIS ONE OUT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR AN AFTERNOON BARBECUE AT THE
7-UP OASIS.

CHRISTINA, SABRINA, KIM,

START WORKING ON YOUR PUZZLE.
GO.
CHRISTINA.
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

Jeff: CHRISTINA HAS ALREADY
GONE AHEAD, NOT HELPING AT ALL.
TROYZAN LEADING THE WAY FOR HIS
TRIBE.
YOU HAVE TO GET BACK TO THAT
PLATFORM BEFORE YOU CAN START
WORKING.
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS WHERE IT IS WON OR LOT
OF, RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S IT.
MOVE THOSE OVER HERE.
Jeff: CHRISTINA, MICHAEL,
SABRINA, LEIF AND KIM TRYING TO
GET A PLAN.
LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING.
THEY LOOK DISORGED.
GO AHEAD.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
Jeff: TROYZAN, KAT,
CHELSEA, ALICIA AND JAY, WORKING
TOGETHER VERY WELL.
TROYZAN HAS A PLAN.
THIS DOESN'T GO UP HERE.
THIS DOESN'T MATCH UP.
HE'S RIGHT.
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T FIT.
RIGHT HERE, MOVE THAT.
YES!
FIND THIS RIGHT HERE, AN
OUTSIDE ONE.
Jeff: TROYZAN THINKS HE HAS
SOMETHING GOING NOW.
THIS IS IT, THIS IS TRIGHT
HERE.
Jeff: SABRINA CERTAIN SHE'S
RIGHT.
Jeff: CHRISTINA'S TRIBE
STARTING TO GET MOMENTUM.
ARE THEY HEADING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
WHO CARES WHAT THEY'RE DOING?
MOVE IT THIS WAY.
Jeff: YELLOW TRIBE IS
GETTING CLOSE.
YES, YES.
Jeff: TRYING TO KEEP THEIR
EXCITEMENT DOWN.
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING
AWAY.
STHOO IT?
Jeff: BOTH TRIBES VERY

I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE GOING TO

CONGRATULATIONS.
COME GET YOUR REWARD AND HEAD

THANK YOU.
Jeff: JAY, TROIZAN, KAT,
ALICIA, CHELSEA, TARZAN, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
♪ ♪ ♪
WHOOO!
WHEN WE FIRST GOT TO THIS
AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL 7-UP OASIS,
IT WAS JUST SHOCKING TO SEE HOW,
SERIOUSLY, A RESORT.
OH, MY GOD.
THERE WAS, LIKE, POTATO SALAD,
POTATO CHIPS, PRETZELS,
COLE SLAW.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST BEEN
HAPPY IF IT WAS PLAIN STEAKS,
HAMBURGER AND HOT DOGS AND TWO
PIES BUT, HEY, THE MORE THE
MERRIER.
IT WAS AMAZING.
WOW!
LORD, WE THANK YOU JUST FOR
ALLOWING US TO BE HERE TODAY AND
NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE HUNGRY AND SO NOT ONLY A
PRAYER AND A TBRAIS FOR US BUT A
PRAYER AND A GRACE FOR THOSE ALL
OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE STARVING.
THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU BE OFFENDED IF I
TOOK A BITE OUT OF THIS PIE.
NO.
NO.
I SPRAYED A LITTLE BIT OF
7-UP ON THE STEAK.
MMM.
STOP MOANING.
THE FOOD IS HUGE.
I MEAN, I NEVER DREAMT I WOULD
FEEL SO WEAK SO TO BE ABLE TO
THINK THROUGH MY OPTIONS AND SIT
UP AND HAVE MY MIND WORK FEELS
AWESOME.
THIS, LIKE, THE BEST MEAL.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.
MY GOSH.
YOU WANNA COME SIT?
I CAN'T STOP EATING THIS.
HOW FAR AHEAD ARE YOU
THINKING?
FAR.
ME, TOO.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
I'D RATHER JUST HAVE THREE
REALLY GOOD PEOPLE THERE AND--
ME, YOU, AND CHELSEA.
YUP.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK, SAB.
IT WOULD PISS ME OFF TO SEE
SOMEBODY LIKE MIKE UP THERE.
ME, TOO, IT HAS TO BE ALL
GIRLS.
YEAH.
YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS.
HOW WOULD YOU BEAT THIS?
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TOIK MAKE
THIS ILLUSION AS IF WE'RE STILL
SALANI.
I SAY MIKE.
OKAY AND THAT PUTS US SIX TO
FOUR.
I SAY WE TAIL TROY.
JUSTICE SAY MIKE IS TRYING TO
GET YOU OUT OF HERE
GET YOU OUT OF HERE
I WAS TRYING TO THINK THROUGH
MY OPTIONS, AND I THOUGHT WHAT
MAKES SENSE IS TO TAKE OUT MIKE.
THE GIRLS ARE ALREADY IN THE
MAJORITY, SO IF WE CAN GET A
UNITED FRONT AND COME TOGETHER,
WE COULD START SENDING THESE
GUYS HOME.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL,
BUT IF ALL SIX GIRLS VOTE
TOGETHER AND JUST GO FOR IT.
WE CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME.
WE CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME.
TRUE.
MIGHT AS WELL.
MIGHT AS WELL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, TROY?
I THINK CHRISTINA.
I AGREE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT CHRISTINA IS
ACTUALLY REALLY, REALLY
ANNOYING, HOWEVER SHE'S NOT AS
BIG A THREAT.
WE TAKE OUT MIKE AND WE ARE
TAKING OUT A THREAT.
HE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT ASAP.
I'M ALL ABOUT THREATS RIGHT NOW
I DON'T TRUST THESE GIRLS.
THEY WANT TO SEND MIKE HOME BUT
I'M GOING TO PUT THAT ON THE
BACK BURNER RIGHT NOW.
THERE ARE TOO MANY GIRLS THAT
COULD HOOK UP AND START KNOCKING
OUT THESE GUYS.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TEACHER JUST
KEEPS SMACKING THE STUDENT MAKE
SURE THEY'RE DOING THE SAME
THING, MAKING SURE THEY'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE HERE.
WELL, WE JUST GOTTA DECIDE
BEFORE TOMORROW COMES.
HI, GUYS.
LOOK WHAT WE BRUTE YOU GUYS?
LOOK WHAT WE BROUGHT YOU.
ARE YOU JOKING?
IT'S ONLY SODA.
WE COULD TAKE AS MUCH AS WE
WANTED.
AND IT'S COLD.
HAVE AT IT.
WHOOO!
I WAS NERVOUS BEFORE THE SIX
OTHER GUYS CAME BACK.
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT WHEN
THEY'RE ON REWARD?
YOU KNOW, ARE THEY TALKING
AMONGST EACH OTHER OR DO THEY
HAVE, LIKE, A NEW PLAN?
AND NOW THAT WE'RE BACK TOGETHER
I REALLY HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON
THOSE GIRLS.
KAT MADE A SUGGESTION THAT MIKE
MAY BE THE NEXT TO GO.
SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
SABRINA, KIM, AND CHELSEA, WANT
TO STICK WITH THE SALANI GROUP
TO THE VERY END.
LOOK HOW WINDY IT IS RIGHT
NOW.
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE
PROBABLY.
LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS.
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING MOVING IN
REALLY FAST.
THIS IS MISERABLE.
LAST NIGHT, IT WAS RAINING AND
WINDY AND THE WALL GOT BLOWN OFF
OUR SHELTER.
EVERYTHING'S WET.
IT'S JUST A BIG TRAIN WRECK.
SO WE HAVE TO BUILD OUR SHELTER
UP BEFORE TONIGHT.
TARZAN DON'T REMOVE ANY MORE
OF THIS STUFF ON THIS SIDE OF
THE WALL.
WE NEED EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.
THAT WAS HANGING THERE
CONNECTED TO NOTHING.
I HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY INTRINSIC
PARTS OF THIS WALL OFF, OKAY,
GUYS?
IT SURE LOOKED THAT WAY.
LIKE THE MOST EDUCATE PEOPLE
HAVE NO COMMON SENSE.
I KNOW.
THE WIND HAS NEVER BEEN THIS
BAD, AND TARZAN TOOK OFF PART OF
OUR BAMBOO WALL TO CUT FOR
FIREWOOD.
WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE STACK OF
FIREWOOD FOR THE FIRE.
BECAUSE SOMEBODY CUT IT AND
LAID IT THERE, OKAY?
I'M NOT THAT STUPID.
IT'S NOT PART OF THE WALL.
OKAY?
CHELSEA, YOU STILL THINKING IT'S
PART OF THE WALL AND I STOLE A
PIECE OF WALL?
I'M OVER IT.
YOU'VE ALREADY CUT IT UP SO IT'S
NO--
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ATTITUDE
WHEN IT'S JUST HANGING THERE.
I DON'T MIND BEING ACCUSED OF
STUFF WHEN I'M WRONG BUT I DON'T
LIKE BEING ACCUSED OF STUFF WHEN
I'M RIGHT.
I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT
ANYMORE
WELL, GOOD.
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND SOMEBODY YOU
SENSE WHETHER YOU'RE AN IRRITANT
TO THEM AND IT SEEMS CHELSEA'S
BEEN SORT OF SUBLIMINALLY
HARASSING ME.
IT WAS AN ACCUSIZATION.
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
JUST LET IT GO.
AND I'M JUST A PERSON IF I
BELIEVE I'VE BEEN UNFAIRLY
MALIGNED, I CAN'T JUST TAKE IT.
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.
AND I THINK I KNOW WHY SHE'S
BEEN UNHAPPY WITH ME.
I SENSE AN AGGRAVATION WITH
ME.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
YOU YOU'VE HAD SURGERY AND I'M A
PLASTIC SURGEON AND YOU DON'T
LIKE YOUR PLASTIC SURGEON OR
SOMETHING, BUT YOU-- YOU'VE BEEN
NEGATIVE TOWARDS ME SINCE I'VE
COME IN CONTACT WITH YOU.
TARZAN TOOK ME OFF TO THE
SIDE AND ASKED ME IF I DIDN'T
LIKE HIM BECAUSE I HAD A BAD
EXPERIENCE WITH MY PLASTIC
SURGEON.
I MEAN, IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S TALKING
ABOUT MY BOOK JOB.
HE'S JUST-- HE'S CRAZY.
ARE YOU SURE THERE ISN'T A
DEEP-SEATED THING BECAUSE THERE
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD PLASTIC
SURGERY AND THEY HATE THEIR
SURGEON.
NO, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYTHING.
IT WAS JUST SO ANNOYING.
TO ME, IT'S, LIKE, GET TARZAN
OUT AS FASTS POSSIBLE.
BUT IT'S A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE
TO THINK WITH YOUR HEAD.
( THUNDER )
IF YOU GET THAT ROPE OVER
HERE, I CAN PULL IT!
LEIF, DAMN IT, GIVE ME THE ROPE!
AS MUCH AS I CAN'T STAND
TARZAN, I THINK AT THIS POINT
IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING STRONGER
PEOPLE OUT WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
A THREAT.
AND TARZAN'S NOT A THREAT AT
ALL.
SO I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I'M
THINKING THAT HE NEEDS TO STICK
AROUND A LITTLE LONGER.
TROY?
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT MIKE IS SUBTLY PLANTING THE
SEED IN LOTS OF PEOPLE'S MINDS
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIN AND
THAT, LIKE, WE CAN'T LET YOU
MAKE IT THAT LONG, AND SO I JUST
FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT TO GET MIKE
OUT OF HERE BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF
THE ONLY PEOPLE I THINK THAT
COULD PULL IN CHRISTINA AND
ALICIA AND GETS ONE MORE OF US
TO VOTE AND YOU'RE GOING HOME
AND THEN WE'RE ALL GOING HOME.
THAT PISSES ME OFF.
TROYZAN AND I WENT THIS
MORNING IN THE RAIN TO GET TREE
MAIL AND I TOLD HIM THIS WHOLE
STORY ABOUT HEY, YESTERDAY, MIKE
WAS THROWING YOUR NAME OUT
THERE.
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE MIKE OUT
FIRST AND THEN WE'LL TAKE UP ON
THE THE GIRLS.
I HATE THAT GUY.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO--
BUT LET'S NOT TELL HIM
BECAUSE WE NEED HIM TO FEEL
REALLY SURE THAT HE'S STAYING.
RIGHT.
THIS MORNING, I HEAR THAT
MIKE WANTS TO ( BLEEP ) TAKE ME
OUT OF THE GAME, AND THAT PITSZS
ME OFF.
HE DOESN'T DO JACK SQUAT.
HE'S JUST AN IDIOT.
THAT GUY--
RIRKS KS, ME, MAN.
YOU ALWAYS WORK ALL THE
ANGLES AND ATTACK THE CHALLENGES
WITH FURY.
LOSE YOUR BALANCE OR
CONCENTRATION TODAY AND TOMORROW
YOU MAY BE ON THE JURY.
MIKE, I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT
SINCE DAY ONE, AND IF MIKE WANTS
TO FREAKING VOTE ME OUT, HE'S
GOT ANOTHER THING COMING.
THAT GUY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE
ON DAY ONE.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
YEAH.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TROYZAN, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.
NOT FOR LONG.
Jeff: THANK YOU, SIR.
"NOT FOR LONG" HE SAYS.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL
RACE ACROSS A LADDER BRIDGE
WHILE MANUVERING BAGS OF PUZZLE
PIECES ALONG THE TWISTING ROPE.
THE FIRST FOUR TO REACH THE
FINISH LINE MOVE ON TO THE FINAL
ROUND WHERE YOU WILL USE THOSE
PUZZLE PIECES TO SOLVE A VERY
COMPLICATED "SURVIVOR" PUZZLE.
FIRST ONE TO GET IT RIGHT WINS
IMIMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, GUARANTEED A ONE
IN CONTINUE SHOT AT THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE

SHOT AT THE MONEY, SURVIVORS

YOU'RE WORKING YOUR WAY ACROSS
THIS LADDER BRIDGE WHILE YOU

DON'T PANIC.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FOUR PEOPLE.
TO MOVE ON TO THE FINAL ROUND.
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, JAY IS
MOVING QUICKLY.
TROYZAN DOING A NICE JOB,
MICHAEL IS IN IT.
KIM, CHELSEA ARE IN IT.
RAIN STARTING TO COME DOWN NOW
RIGHT ON CUE.
JAY GETTING CLOSER TO THE

KIM FIGHTING FOR THOSE FOUR
SPOTS.
JAY IS ACROSS FIRST.
JAY MOVING ON TO THE FINALS.
THREE SPOTS LEFT.
TROYZAN CLOSE.
MICHAEL NOW HUNG UP.
HE'S BEEN AT THE SAME SPOT FOR A
WHILE.
KIM VERY CLOSE NOW.
KIM IS ACROSS.
KIM IS MOVING ON.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO MORE
SPOTS.
ALICIA NOW IN IT.
TARZAN IS IN IT.
MICHAEL AND TROYZAN HAVE BLOWN A
GIGANTIC LEAD.
OPENING THE DOOR FOR SOMEBODY
ELSE TO SLIDE THROUGH.
TROYZAN FINALLY FIGURING IT OUT.
TROYZAN IS THROUGH.
YES!
Jeff: WE HAVE ONE SPOT
LEFT.
DIG, PEOPLE.
CHELSEA FALLS OFF SHE'S GOT TO
GO BACK TO THE START.
ALICIA MOVES ON TO THE FINAL.
YES!
Jeff: JAY, TROYZAN, ALICIA,
AND KIM MOVING ON.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
IT IS KIM, ALICIA, TROYZAN, AND
JAY IN THE FINAL ROUND.
FIRST ONE TO SOLVE THIS PUZZLE
WINS IMMUNITY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
FIRST STEP, YOU HAVE TO OPEN ALL
THE BAGS OF PIECES.
THERE ARE 60 PIECES TO THIS
PUZZLE.
60 BLOCKS OF WOOD.
YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT HOME
FOR.
THIS IS TOO HARD.
Jeff: THIS WILL BE A FLAT,
SQUARE PUZZLE WHEN YOU ARE DONE.
LOTS OF ANGLES TO WORK WITH ON
THESE PIECES.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.
ALICIA VERY EXCITED.
SHE GETS HER FIRST PIECE IN.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES TO BE
PLACED.
YOU WILL KNOW IF THE PIECE IS
RIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL LINE UP
FLAT.
IF IT'S NOT FLAT, IT'S NOT RI
RIGHT.
KIM LOOKS TO BE VERY CLOSE.
ALICIA VERY CLOSE NOW.
TROYZAN IS IN ON IT.
JAY IS DEAD LAST AT THIS POINT.
REALLY TAKING HIS TIME VERY
METHODICALLY.
I HATE PUZZLES.
Jeff: TROYZAN AND JAY
TRYING TO CATCH UP, BUT KEEP IN
MIND, THE PUZZLE COULD LOOK
RIGHT UNTIL THE VERY LAST PIECE,
AND THEN YOU FIND OUT
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
Jeff: SO KEEP WORKING ON
THIS, REGARDLESS WHAT THE PERSON
NEXT TO YOU IS DOING.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
Jeff: KIM GETTING CLOSER.
WHAT!
Jeff: ONE IS NOT RIGHT.
NOW SHE'S GOT TO GET IT OUT,
FIND THE RIGHT SPOT.
THAT'S OPENING THE DOOR FOR
TROYZAN TO GET BACK IN ON THIS.
JAY IS SUDDENLY BACK IN THIS
NOW.
HE WAS DEAD LAST BEFORE.
EVERYBODY'S IN THIS CHALLENGE
NOW.
ALICIA IS GETTING CLOSER.
DOES ALICIA HAVE IT?
NO.
ALICIA HAS A PIECE STICKING UP.
SHE'S NOT RIGHT.
JAY NOW GETTING CLOSER.
COULD JAY PULL THIS HUGE
COME-FROM-BEHIND VICTORY OUT?
RIGHT HERE.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, COME ON, GO.
THERE YOU GO.
Jeff: KIM GETTING CLOSER.
GOOD JOB!
Jeff: IT'S KIM AND JAY.
JAY PLACES ANOTHER PIECE.
HE'S GETTING CLOSER.
KIM DOWN TO HER LAST PIECE.
JAY DOWN TO HIS LAST PIECE.
KIM, NO!
OUT OF NOWHERE, JAY WINS
IMMUNITY!
WOW!
( APPLAUSE )
WOW!
SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE
RACE, BABY.
YUP.
AMAZING.
Jeff: JAY, COME ON OVER.
( APPLAUSE )
JAY BIRD.
Jeff: YOU WERE DEAD LAST
FOR MOST OF THAT PUZZLE PART OF
THE CHALLENGE, OUT OF THE BLUE,
CAME FROM BEHIND, IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.
SAFE TONIGHT.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, ONE OF
YOU GOING HOME TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
CONGRATS.
NICE COMEBACK!
YEAH.
TONIGHT, I HAD THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE AROUND MY NECK, SO I
FEEL SAFE.
I DEFINITELY THINK THAT SINCE WE
KNOCKED JONAS OFF LAST TIME, YOU
KNOW, I THINK IT'S JUST A SAFE
VOTE TO KNOCK OFF A GIRL.
SO WE'RE GOING TO SEND CHRISTINA
HOME.
THAT KEEPS THE OLD SALANI
MEMBERS GOING STRONG AND SENDS
AN OLD MANONO MEMBER HOME AS
WELL AS EVENS OUT THE GUYS
VERSUS THE GIRLS.
VERSUS THE GIRLS.
RIGHT NOW, I'M STRADDLING TO
ALLIANCES.
I HAVE AN ALL-WOMEN ALLIANCE AND
I HAVE NIGH SALANI ALLIANCE WITH
TROY, JAKE JAY, AND MIKE.
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME
FOR THE GIRLS TO TAKE OVER THIS
GAME.
I KNOW THAT CHELSEA AND THE
GIRLS WILL BE ON BOARD WITH
THAT, AND TROIRK HE'S BLINDED BY
HIS DISLIKE OF MIKE.
SO I'M USING TROY TO SEND MIKE
HOME TONIGHT.
I DIDN'T TALK TO JAY DID,
YOU?
I DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE.
I'M SURE HE'S FINE WITH IT.
MY CONCERN IS IF JAY FIND OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BECAUSE
IF JAY GETS SUSPICIOUS AND GETS
TO TROY AND TROY GETS NERVOUS
THAT COULD BE TROUBLE.
I STILL HAVE TO KEEP MY OPTIONS
OPEN, AND WHO KNOWS?
I MAY NEED THOSE GUYS FOR
ANOTHER VOTE OR TWO.
JAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING
RID OF MIKE TONIGHT?
TO BE HONEST, I'M SCARED OF
Y'ALL GIRLS.
IF Y'ALL GET RID OF HIM, Y'ALL
GET RID OF ME NEXT.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
THAT'S REAL PROMISING.
ANYBODY GOT ANY INPUT WHILE
I'M SITTING HERE?
OR ARE WE GONNA SCRAMBLE ONE ON
ONE AND DO THIS?
I WAS SITTING IN THE SHELTER AND
CHELSEA LOOKED AT ME AND ASKED
IF I WAS GOING TO SEND MIKE HOME
AND IT JUST REALLY SHOCKED ME
THAT SHE WOULD SAY THIS IN FRONT
OF ALICIA AND CHRISTINA.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF MY
ALLIANCE AND YOU'RE TALKING LIKE
THIS IN FRONT OF TWO OTHER
PEOPLE.
I DON'T LIKE THAT PLAN.
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THESE
GIRLS BECAUSE FIDON'T GO ALONG
WITH THEM AND THEY VOTE OUT
MIKE, THEY MIGHT VERY WELL COME
AFTER ME.
JAY WAS LIKE, "I DON'T TRUST
THAT BECAUSE THAT MEANS I COULD
BE THE NEXT TO GO AND Y'ALL ARE
GOING TO HAVE AN ALL-GIRLS THING
GOING ON."
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
APPARENTLY, CHELSEA LITERALLY
SAT THERE IN THE SHELTER IN
FRONT OF THE TWO GIRLS THAT ARE
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF OUR
ALLIANCE AND ASKED JAY TO VOTE
FOR MIKE.
THAT'S ASININE.
WE NEED TO KEEP TROY AND JAY
THINKING IT'S SALANI TO THE END.
AND NOW IT'S KIND OF BECOME A
HUGE MESS.
SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THIS
IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN.
WE CANNOT SEND A GIRL HOME
TONIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TELL
MIKE?
MIKE IS GOING TO ASK ME WHO
WE'RE VOTING FOR.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN BE COOL
ABOUT IT AND NOT GET PANICKY.
MIKE JUST WENT FOR A WALK.
HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS CAMP UP.
I'M GOING.
PURE INSANITY.
WHAT ARE Y'ALL THINKING?
I DON'T KNOW.
NOBODY'S TALKED TO ME.
CHECK THIS OUT.
WE WERE SITTING BACK THERE,
CHOMPING ON POPCORN--
LET'S DO CHRISTINA.
THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.
AND THEN NEXT TIME DO GUY AND
GIRL.
THEN THE MANONO TRIBE IS GONE.
I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T TRUST
Y'ALL BUT I'M JUST SAYING I
DON'T HAVE A GOOD VIBE GOING ON.
JAY, YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY
NERVOUS, BUT MY ALLIANCE IS
STICKING TOGETHER AND FOR EVERY
PERSON THAT'S NOT IN AN ALLIANCE
IT'S YOUR TURN TO GO.
THERE'S NO SCRAMBLING.
EVERYBODY CAN JUST RELAX AND GO
TO TRIBAL.
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO
YOU, YOU KNOW, THEN YOU'RE OKAY.
BUT I COULD SAY THAT NOW AND
HAVE MY TRIBE BLINDSIDE ME BUT I
JUST TONIGHT SEE THAT HAPPENING.
YOU.
WOW.I'M JUST SAYING, SOMETHING'S
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AFTER
TONIGHT SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
RIGHT NOW IS DECIDE IT IF WE'RE
GOG LAY DOWN TONIGHT AND VOTE
CHRISTINA OFF OR IF WE'RE ABOUT
TO MAKE OUR MOVE BECAUSE THIS IS
NEVER GOING TO BE THE SAME IF WE
DO THIS.
I'M TORN OVER WHAT TO DO BECAUSE
IT'S A HUGE MOVE TO TAKE OUT THE
GUYS IN OUR ALLIANCE, AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, JAY FREAKED OUT.
SO ARE WE GONNA, LIKE, CAUSE A
MAJOR UPROAR, GO WITH THE
WOMEN'S ALLIANCE, AND VOTE OFF
MIKE?
OR DO WE VOTE OFF CHRISTINA,
KEEP SALANI TOGETHER?
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A
CHOICE AND GO WITH IT.
WHATEVER HAPPENS IS GOING TO
CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME.
CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
JONAS, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
I WANT TO START BY ASKING ONE
QUESTION LOOKING FOR A TRUTHFUL
RESPONSE.
WHO HERE TONIGHT IS GENUINELY
WORRIED THAT IT IS THEM GOING
HOME TONIGHT?
NOBODY.
THINKS IT'S THEM TONIGHT.
AMAZING.
SO WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THERE
THERE
ARE A LOT OF ALLIANCES AND ALL
OF THEM FEEL VERY SOLID AND
VERY LOYAL.
TARZAN, DO YOU GET A KICK OUT OF
THE FACT THAT NOBODY, INCLUDING
YOURSELF, THINKS THEY'RE IN
TROUBLE TONIGHT, AND YET WE KNOW
IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS SOMEBODY
WILL BE OUT OF THIS GAME FOR
GOOD.
IT MEANS SOMEBODY HAS BEEN
VERY GOOD AT DECEIVING IS WHAT
IT
MEANS, JEFF.
Jeff: TROYZAN IF YOU GOT
BLINDSIDED BY YOUR ALLIANCE
WOULD IT REALLY BLOW YOU AWAY?
YEAH, I FEEL LIKE IF I GOT
BLINDSIDEIDE DIDN'T BRING MY
BAGS SO, YEAH, I WOULD BE
SHOCKED.
Jeff: KIM, DO YOU FEEL THE
SAME WAY?
IT WOULD BLOW ME AWAY.
Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU,
CHELSEA.
SAME.
CHRISTINA.
SAME.
Jeff: MIKE, SAME QUESTION.
IT WOULD BLOW ME AWAY.
IT WOULD BE A COMPLETE SURPRISE.
Jeff: KIM, WHERE IS THE
CONFIDENCE COMING FROM THAT
NOBODY TONIGHT THINKS IT'S THEM.
I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
THINK THEY'RE PART OF AN
ALLIANCE AND THAT'S WHERE THE
CONFUSION IS SETTING IN.
WE ALL DID HAVE OUR FIRST
ALLIANCES BUT THEN WE HAD TIME
TO DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS
WHEN WE SWITCHED TRIBES SO I
THINK SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR OPTIONS OPEN AND KNOW WHEN
TO STICK WITH A PLAN, TOO.
Jeff: CHELSEA, THAT'S A
REALLY CAREFULLY CRAFTED ANSWER.
I THINK IN A WAY YOU WANT TO
BE ALIGNED WITH MORE THAN TWO
GROUPS, MAYBE YOU WANT TO BE
ALIGNED WITH THREE GROUPS, AND
JUST SEE WHICH ONE HAS MORE
TRUST AND KEEP YOURSELF WITH THE
MAJORITY.
SO MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MORE
OPTIONS.
Jeff: ALICIA, DOES THAT ADD
A WHOLE OTHER DIMENSION THAT YOU
NOW HAVE 11 PEOPLE EXPERK
BECAUSE THE LINES AREN'T REALLY
CLEAR, I HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF
EVERYBODY, BECAUSE ANYBODY COULD
BE COMING FOR ME?
I DEFINITELY AGREE.
I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW, WE STILL
DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON WHOSE SIDE.
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE
OF TRIBAL COUNCILS TO FIGURE IT
OUT, AND SEE WHO IS LOYAL TO WHO
AND WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ONE ON
TOP.
Jeff: CHRISTINA, SIX WOMEN,
FIVE MEN, IS THERE ANY TALK THAT
IT MIGHT STILL BE MEN VERSUS
WOMEN?
I'M SURE, YEAH.
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF
THE NEW ALLIANCES THAT THEY
BUILD FROM THE SALANI TRIBE AND
THE MANONO TRIBE.
Jeff: WHEN WE SWITCHED.
RIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY A LOT OF
PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY SURE IF
THEY ARE GOING OR NOT.
Jeff: TARZAN.
WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT, JEFF,
BUT WE'RE ALL JUST PLAYING YOU
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS NIGHT IS.
WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID IS THE
ALLEGIANCES THAT WERE FORMED
PRIOR TO COMING HERE ONE WOULD
THINK WOULD BE RELATIVELY FIRM
AND NOT SO WISHY-WASHY, AND IF
WE REVEAL TOO MUCH IT WILL RUIN
THE WHOLE THING SO THE GAME IS
AFOOT AND THAT'S WHY WE REMAIN
EXWIGZ.
IT'S OUR BEST BET.
AND, THEREFORE, YOU'RE BEING
PLAYED.
Jeff: SO I'M BEING PLAYED
TONIGHT.
YOU BET, YOU'RE BEING PLAYED.
Jeff: I'M SURE YOU SENSE
THAT.
( LAUGHTER ).
Jeff: KAT, WE'VE GOT A
MILLION-DOLLAR GAME ON THE LINE,
WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE AND EVERYONE
IS LAUGHING AT TARZAN.
IT'S SO FUNNY.
EVERYBODY IS IN A GOOD MOOD.
IT'S BECAUSE HIS RANT T
RANTIC IS SO TARZAN.
IT'S LIKE A BOOM!
AND YOU'RE LIKE WHAT JUST HA
HAPPEN.
Jeff: DID I GET TAR SWRAND
TONIGHT?
YOU GOT TARZANNED.
Jeff: MICHAEL, WHEN TARZAN
SAYS, "I'M BEING PLAYED,
"CLEARLY IT'S EVERYBODY EXCEPT
AT LEAST ONE PERSON.
THERE'S AT LEAST TWO
ALLIANCES, BUT THEN AT THE SAME
TIME, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS
EXACTLY WITH WHO BECAUSE
EVERYBODY TALKS.
AS FAR AS ME AND MY ALLIANCE, I
MEAN, I DON'T TALK MUCH AROUND
CAMP BUT WHEN I DO I REMAIN
COOL.
THAT'S HOW I AM AS A PERSON.
MY ALLIANCE, I THINK IS STRONG.
Jeff: WITH THAT, I WILL SAY
TO YOU, TARZAN, THOUGH YOU THINK
I'M BEING PLAYED.
I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF YOU GUYS
ARE BEING PLAYED, AND WE'RE
GOING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS.
CANNOT VOTE FOR JAY.
HE HAS THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, CHRISTINA.
CHRISTINA.
TWO VOTES CHRISTINA.
TARZAN.
TARZAN.
TWO VOTES CHRISTINA, TWO VOTES
TARZAN.
MIKE.

THAT'S THREE VOTES MIKE.

THAT'S FOUR VOTES MIKE.
TWO VOTES CHRISTINA, TWO VOTES
TARZAN.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT, AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, MIKE.
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
MIKE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, YOU CAME IN HERE TONIGHT
COMPLETELY CONFIDENT IT WASN'T
YOU, AND YET, THREE OF YOU
RECEIVED VOTES.
IF THAT DOESN'T SHAKE THE
CONFIDENCE OF THIS GROUP,
NOTHING WILL.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

INDIVIDUALLY, AND I THOUGHT I
HAD A GOOD THING WITH THEM, BUT,
APPARENTLY,UN, YOU CAN'T TRUST
ANYBODY, AND I THOUGHT I COULD
TRUST SO MANY WOMEN OUT HERE BUT
IT WASN'T THE CASE
