        Previously on "survivor.
" We are switching tribes.
oh,my god!
After an unexpected Switch,an even battle between
Men and women turned into a Lopsided affair.
it's like greek gods versus Peasants.
Salani drew all the Strength leaving
manono as the Clear underdogs.
I got on a tribe with people Who suck!
Salani wins reward!
Salani wins immunity!
The new salani were seven strong
And they dominated every Challenge.
Salani wins ice cream reward!








we're kicking their ass.
I mean,bottom line.
at manono,losing was taking A toll on the
tribe but for Colton it was business as usual.
you can quit or you can jump In that
fire,which ever is more Convenient for you.
I'm running this entire show Right now.
If you can't see that
you are Helen keller.
Then a sudden illness Put
a stop to colton's plans.
But even a medical evacuation Couldn't
stop colton from Influencing the game.
he's going to keep the
Immunity idol for a souvenir.
Call me a bad person but all I Kept
thinking was strategy the Whole time.
Colton's departure Sent
both tribes to tribal Council
**
where they reunited
at An unexpected merge.
You can drop your buffs,we Merged.








The game has come full
circle And we are even.
Grab your torches head back to Camp.
Six men and six women.
12 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
***
oh,my god,there's cheese!
this seems like "survivor" to Me now.
It's a merge,it's me against 11 People.
That's what I wanted,that's What
I've been waiting for so Bring it on.
would anybody like my sip?
I don't drink.
You can have mine.
I knew the merge was coming.
I'm sure christina... I don't Think
she'll be in the game much Longer.
It's crazy right now.
That should have been christina
Going home and not colton.
By colton leaving,he screwed me Over,
especially fact that he Didn't
give me his immunity idol
So I have to start all over Again.
Maybe I'll go back to my home Girls
and continue the girl Power run
and really wipe the Guys out.
The back stabbing is going to Begin.

All these people you don't
want To live with anymore
and now They're back in the
same tribe And it's just like oh.
last drop,anybody?
even though it is a

oh,my lord!
I've been talking about
pizza Since day one.
you guys,everyone did
a Fantastic effort.
to endurance.
The challenge we had
to do today Was a doozy.
It was a nail-biter but
at the Very end we won.
This pizza could have been ice
Cold and I would have tore it Up.
I don't care.
I know good pizza,I've been
Living in new york for ten Years.
Anything other than this dry-ass
Rice we're eating out here
and a Chicken we catch every blue
Moon,it's great so pizza was Priceless.
they could have brought out Fried skunk.
oh,my gosh!
rock 'n roll!
all right,guys we have this.
what does it say?
it says "open when you're Finished
eating before you get Back to camp.
" Alall right.
"immunity is the only way to
Guarantee your safety in this Game.
As part of your reward for
Winning today's challenge,
only You six will know that there is
Yet another idol hidden back at Camp.
" theless people that know About the idol
the more likely One of us can find it.
So if I were up to me I wouldn't
Go back to camp and be like
"hey,the letter said there
was An idol somewhere.
" It makes me nervous that
the Idol is still out there.
My biggest concern is for
Someone on the manono tribe to Find
the idol going into the Next vote.
And messing up our numbers.
Because we can't have a salani Go home.
{\a6}***
I wanted that pizza and beer So bad.
I got sand every part of my Body.
you trying to tell us you're Going to be
pooping sand for the Next couple of days?
we need to get stuff
together Here,you know?
like supplies?
Or,like,thoughts?
no,just whatever our plan Is,you know?
I thought tarzan
already Established that.
what was that?
that the guys stick together
And alicia is the swing vote.
That's kind of weird that you
Don't even know what that plan Is.
yeah.
that's what he was saying but He should
probably fill you in With the plan.
we didn't have a chance to Talk.
I'll ask about that later on.
yeah
apparently,the bright tarzan Goes
and has a secret meeting With mike
and tells him this Plan
which I'm not even aware Of.
The guy makes zero sense.
He's a lose cannon and does Whatever
the hell he wants we Can't have that.
You tell the least reliable guy The
plan,does that make sense Tow-to-you?
yeah,because we need six Guys.
you tell him right before
the Vote,not two days before!
If he's playing both
sides,what Is he going to do?
He's going to tell the
women and Then we're ed.
This is my point.
We need to consult as an
Alliance before we start Blabbing.
I thought... when did it change
and why am I the last guy to know?
two days ago I told you that Plan.
Two days ago I told you that Plan!
listen to me,I'm not done Speaking.
you are such a confused,I'm
done talking with You.
I'm done talking.
you're accusing me of
Something right now.
don't **ing interrupt Me.
listen to me for a second!
Stop (bleep)ing interrupting me.
I'm tired of your (bleep)ing (bleep).
And you telling me... I'm not
Even in the (bleep)ing loop.
well you know what?
There's so much confusion I'm
Going to drop out of the tribe
And you guys continue without Me.
That's what I'm going to do.
I'm dropping my allegiance with You guys
because every time I Try to tell
you something you Contradict med,
you don't Remember what I say.
I'm done with it.
what are you fighting about.
misunderstanding.
Jonas,let's admit it.
I don't like you.
Don't talk to me anymore.
I'm out of it.
all right.
Good luck.
I'll fall on the sword.
I'm perfectly wil willing to do.
I can only play this game so
Long before it's irritating.
I do not like jonas.
I do not like that guy anymore.
When I say something I mean it From
my heart and I don't go Back on it.
Can't look at that face anymore.
****
everyone always sleeps in and
I get up at 4:00 in the morning
**
So I'm going to find the idol.
These knuckle heads aren't going
To be awake for another hour.
Yes!
That's it!
Early bird gets the
idol and Gets the power.
I had my eye on the two big Trees close
to the beach and I It this jackpot.
To find the hidden immunity
Idol,that's like winning the Gold medal.
God,I want to,likes,wear it.
Troyzan is safe!
This could be a million dollars.
This is crazy to think about it.
This could take me freaking far.
come on in,guys!
So is there a new tribe name?

year so it's like year Of the god.

{\a6}***
great job.
jonas,I thought you might Pull
it out with your chef Skills.
great job,bro.
thanks,buddy.
you did good.
we're definitely going
to Have to talk later.
I think a lot of people are Going
to be doing some Scrambling action.
yeah.
this is like "survivor" to The ultimate.
I mean,I won an immunity
today,I have an immunity idol.
I've got a group that I feel Solid,
my old salani who Basically have
been pretty Straightforward with me
and so Whatever they decide to
do That's what I'm going to do.
I think it's pretty plain and Simple
that we stick to salani Or 7-5.
yeah.
just pick off their five Strongest to
weakest and then We're back at salani.
so,look,we need to figure Out who
we want off I say jonas Aalicia.
We can ask around,to,but
make Jonas the first choice.
okay.
It's guys versus girls but the Way I
see it is we keep it Salani versus manono
we should Take out manono's
strongest People first.
I don't think that... Would You
guys be cool voting jonas First?
let's go jonas first.
jonas is first.
I think jonas is their
Strongest player right now.
Which I hate because he's a Great cook.
Great positive attitude.
Fun to be around.
But jonas I'm thinking is
going To be the next to go.
- hey,you.
- hey,you.
no one has come up to me.
come up to me,girlfriend.
I just think everyone's thinking
Jonas but everybody's like
I hate to vote jonas out he's
so Nice and he cooks good soup.
" I don't care whether
he makes A great soup.
for tonight's vote we want to Vote
jonas out since he's the Biggest threat
and keep Christina and alicia around
just In case we need a girl's Alliance.
To get a guy out and Particularly
one of the new Manono tribe members
it leaves The girls in the majority it
Leaves my old salani tribe in The majority
and gives me two Great
options moving forward.
who do you... Are you
looking At right now?
honestly I was thinking jonas
Because he's real smart,real Capable.
I know.
a lot of people have
been Talking about jonas
because they Think they
feel he's a big Threat
and he's the smartest of
The guys and I was like,geez,
You guys,are you kidding me?
We're going to let this guy go?
He feedss proerbgs
sides are For us,why now?
are you serious,dude?
They're talking about he?
they mentioned my name.
yeah,they did.
why would they want to vote Me?
I have no idea.
when you hear your name has Come up,you
immediately think Oh,crap,I'm going home.
Yeah,I'm kind of getting the
Feeling that I'm out of the Loop.
It makes no logical sense to
me Strategically to vote me out
I'm,like,the least threatening Guy here.
There's mike who's the most Dominant
person as far as Immunity challenges
so they want To keep him around over me
and So immediately I go into Survival mode.
so I just wanted to throw you This out.
I was out of line like
Completely was acting.
- we all get...
- I was ridiculous and I Apologize.
you're apologizing?
Really.
- really.
- thank you.
we here in situation Like...
that brings tears to my eyes,Thank you
jonas and I admittedly Are a bad marriage
but strangely We respect each other.
I was so struck by the Personality it took for
him to Do that that it brought me to Mild tears.
it's all right,man.
I never cry.
Since he's done that I respect Him
even more so we're back Together again
and that made me Feel really remarkable.
We got four guys here for sure.
We're still bondd?
Okay.
We all vote for kat.
That's the best we can do.
That's the best we can do.
We'll vote for kat.
she doesn't do much,I know.
that's all we got.
so we're voting for kat kind
Of as a last-minute scramble.
I'd rather vote mike out instead
But we figured,you know,kat,
She doesn't pull her
weight all A whole lot,
she kind of annoys A lot of people so that's
my Only hope at this point is I'm Voting kat.
do you have any clothing
that Needs to be boiled.
just my undies.
excellent.
this is not poop,okay,it's Dirt.
okay. okay. all right.
But you can see how that looks
To me how it could be poop,Right?
I know.
I can't even look in that Direction.
- I swear to god it is not Poop.
- it's chocolate,okay?
it's dirt.It's dirt,I swear.
so why is there dirt
Concentrated in one area?
because it's near my butt.
I swear,if it's in pwaoling Water you don't
have to worry Even if it was poop pants.
At least that's what I think.
we talked about who we
Thought should go home next.
I wanted to get a good batch of
Laundry done,get my stuff Clean.
So I put in the the salt
water,Scrubbed it really good with Sand.
I was going to have some clean Clothes.
it's not poop,it's dirt,I Swear.
yeah,but I've already
Cleaned my own n the ocean.
You need to clean them the Ocean.
these have been cleaned in The ocean.
don't do that.
let me clean them in the Ocean first.
- I know all about Microbiology.
- ***
ook ok
let me get my stuff out First.
it doesn't make any Difference.
I have been working about it.
even so the microbes
are dead When it boils.
It's not that contagious.
I'm going to go puke,I'll be Right back.
you don't want to tend the Fire?
**
if it were up to me tarzan Would go home
because I'm all About who deserves to be here.
Who has a positive attitude?
Who brings everyone up
when Everyone's down?
Who's just a good person to be Around?
Tarzan doesn't fill any
of those Empty lines.
Jonas works has ass
off and Feeds all of us.
Can we spare him a couple more Days?
And take tarzan's ass out.
At least we have someone
around That's feeding us.
Tarzan just pisses
everyone off,You know?
I understand your thought.
Your thought was take out dead Weight.
I completely hate to see
dead Weight alicia,christina,
Tarzan,leif,I hate them
Sitting around camp.
But you have to look at it.
If you set a plan in
place and It gets broken
all hell can Break loose and
come back to Bite you in the butt.
Sabrina,what's the
Single-biggest difference now
That you're merged and it is
Every individual for themselves?
it's very chaotic.
Everyone's trying to predict
Where they will stand,
who's With who and just like,okay,
it Can't be peaceful right now not One
someone's head is on the Chopping block.
Jonas,is it Inevitable to be thinking
"who Do I want to sit next to at the
End and how do I make sure I'm There?
" it is critical but you can
be Thinking way too far ahead.
I had people today say "hey,You're a threat
because you're a Provider and you cook.
" Yeah,but you don't
vote that Guy out first!
Not only that,you want to go to
Immunity challenges against this Guy?
That's not good strategy.
Mike versus he?
as you can tell today I Didn't
really perform that well.
You can be great at
puzzles,I Might suck.
I'm not done,bro,I'm not Done speaking.
I'm proposing to those people
That know what I'm talking about
I'm voting for mike tonight.
well,mike,hot seat brother.
I disrespect what jonas just Did.
I disrespect it deeply.
Giving up his principles,Throwing
mike under the bus.
He doesn't have to fight for his
Life and that's the end of that.
I'm not going to say anything Else.
So,jonas,tarzan is Saying
"relax,brother,you're Not going home tonight.
" I'm not saying that now Because he
may have thrown Himself over the bus.
the fact of the matter is
Despite your brilliant plan
we Do not have the
votes to vote Off kat.
what's I do?
Tarzan,you can tell me.it's ok
he's laying,kat,okay?
It's getting worse and
worse as You go on,jonas.
you did propose that.
you want to attack all
of us While you're at it?
I'm just stating the fact.
jeff,I think we ought to Vote jonas out.
He's worried about it,we
might As well vote him out.
I'm sick of this.
Why the big reaction?
What are we not getting?
jonas has been on my back From day one.
He's always undermining me.
So you know what?
I'm going to go up there
and put His name down.
I'm telling you what I'm going To do.
I'm sick of it,I hope
you go Home tonight.
I'm sick of fighting with you.
that's fine.
But the bottom line is I'm
Trying to play the game.
You can't blame me for that.
jeff?
Chelsea?
on jonas' defense,I think
More people have had issues
and Arguments with tarzan
than they Have with jonas.
Sabrina you're Nodding
your head in agreement.
I've had a couple run-ins
With tarzan like everyone else
I'm sure has but I have
had zero Issues with jonas.
But... the thing is,jeff,if you're Comparing
likability I admit I'm Not as likable as jonas.
I'm awkward outside my Environment.
What is your Environment?
my environment is a hospital And operating
room and I do Great in that environment.
You know,you're the captain of The ship
in an operating room or Somebody dies.
So this is a very Different world for you
because There is no captain of this Ship.
you know,I have ideas that I Think help people
and when they Don't see it,it irritates me.
So,kim,it's very Interesting
what developed here Tonight.
You have jonas who everybody
Says is likable and provides.
He stirs the pot and out comes The guy
on the end who says "I'm The old guy,
I don't really like This
social part of this Game...".
I didn't say I didn't like The social.
I said I'm awkward in it.
Case in point.
Even I can't get it right.
that's the beauty of a merge,I think.
You know,all of a sudden people Like jonas become
a threat and People like tarzan become an Asset.
Depend how you look At it.
sure.
Chelsea,where do you Weigh in on this?
I just think there's people You want
to keep around because They're positive,
they're Providers,they help out so
much And then there's dead weight.
did you mean me?
maybe.
So,tarzan,as this Tribal has evolved are
you Concerned it could be you Tonight?
I came here wondering whether Allegiances would
be maintained And I sense we've fallen apart.
So that makes the whole thing
Totally mercurial at this point
Not knowing which way
or how It's going go.
I mean,if they want to
vote me Off that's fine.
I'm voting for jonas tonight
Because of what he did.
All right,let's find Out how
this is going to shake Out.
