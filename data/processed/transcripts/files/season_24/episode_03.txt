        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR."
GO, GO, GO!
Jeff: THIS SEASON'S BATTLE
OF THE SEXES HASN'T BEEN A
BATTLE AT ALL.
THE MEN'S TRIBE HAS WON EVERY
CHALLENGE.
é
( CHEERS )
WITH CONFIDENCE AT AN ALL-TIME
HIGH, MATT AND HIS ALLIANCE OF








MUSCLE THOUGHT THEY WERE RUNNING
THE SHOW.
IT'S THE DOMINANT ALLIANCE
CLEARLY.
Jeff: BUT THE REST OF THE
TRIBE HAD PLANS OF THEIR OWN.
COLTON, LIFE, TARZAN, JONAS AND
TROIZAN FORMED AN UNLIKELY
ALLIANCE.
AT THE LAST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
THE WOMEN'S BIGGEST OBSTACLE WAS
CAT AND WITH THAT CAT JUMPED IN
FOR NO REASON, COMPLETELY
FALLING APART.








AND THE MEN WON THEIR THIRD
CHALLENGE IN A ROW.
MEN WIN IMMUNITY!
BACK AT CAMP, CAT ONLY MADE
MATTERS WORSE BY WEARING HER
EMOTIONS ON HER SLEEVE.
IT WAS SO HARD--
DON'T OVERTHINK IT.
CAT IS VERY YOUNG AND
EMOTIONAL AND THAT'S A
LIABILITY.
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IT
WAS CLEAR THAT CAT'S ALLIANCE
COULD DO WITHOUT HER.
CHELSEA IF YOU COULD START OVER
DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS WOULD FORM
DIFFERENT ALLIANCEs?
YEAH, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
DIFFERENT.
Jeff: IN THE END CAT WAS
SAVED WHEN THEY VOTED OUT NINA,
THE OLDEST MEMBER OF THE TRIBE,
BELIEVED TO BE A LIABILITY IN
CHALLENGES.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, WE ARE ONLY FIVE DAYS IN,
AND YOU'VE YET TO WIN A
CHALLENGE.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
KITTY-KAT, GIVE ME A HUG.
DON'T TRY AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
DIDN'T MEAN TO.
I DIDN'T.
I SUCKED IT UP.
ALL EYES ARE ON KAT RIGHT
NOW.
WE'RE JUST STARTING TO LOOK AT
THE WEAKER PLAYERS, EVEN THEY'RE
IN OUR ALLIANCE.
WHAT A JOKE.
OUR NEXT MOVE IS JUST TO TRY TO
STAY AS POSITIVE AS POSSIBLE.
IF WE JUST GET THE SMALLEST
GLIMMER OF HOPE, I THINK IT WILL
CHALLENGE THE WHOLE TRIBE, JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE IS
ALL WE NEED.
HEY.
DO Y'ALL WANT TO COME OVER TO
OUR--
YOU SCARED ME.
THIS IS A MASSIVE ASS STORM
COMING IN.
WE MIGHT BE RUNNING OUR
LITTLE TAILS DOIN THERE.
WE'LL SEE HOW BAD IT GETS
OVER HERE.
GOOD NIGHT, GIRLS.
GOOD NIGHT.
IT JUST GOT COLD.
, JUST CAME UP OUT OF NOWHERE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE
HORRENDOUS.
COLTON JUST CAME BY AND SAID
IF THE WEATHER GETS BAD WE COULD
DOWN THERE AND TRY TO SLEEP
UNDER THEIR SHELTERS.
GUYS, I SAY WE TOUGH IT OUT.
WE'LL BE FINE.
OH MY GOD!
IT'S FREEZING.
THE WIND IS COMING STRAIGHT
THROUGH HERE.
I FELT RAINDROPS.
OH, MY GOD, I FEEL RAIN, TOO.
THE MEN, THEY HAVE A TARP.
BUT WE DON'T, AND IT WAS
RAINING.
AND RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE OUR
WHOLE SHELTER IS ABOUT TO BLOW
DOWN.
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S SO COLD.
IT'S SO COLD.
WE'VE BEEN CRAPPED ON SINCE
WE'VE BEEN HERE.
WE GOT ZERO SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
WE STAYED UP THE ENTIRE NIGHT.
FROZE SOAK WET.
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD FIRE BECAUSE
IT RAINED AND PUT IT OUT, SO NOW
WE HAVEN'T EATEN.
WHERE IS THE SUN?
HEY, BOYS.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
THEY SAID MY NAME.
OH, COME ON!
YOU DON'T HAVE FIRE, DO YOU?
DO I HAVE FIRE?
YEAH.
IS YOUR'S ALL OUT.
WE HAVE FIRE?
IS IT STILL GOING?
ARE YOU GUYS SOAKED?
TOTALLY SOAKED.
CAN WE GO BY YOUR FIRE AND
DRY OUT?
SURE, GO OVER THERE.
GO RIGHT NOW.
IT'S GOING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S FINE.
I JUST WANT TO BE WARM FOR,
LIKE, ONE MINUTE.
I CAN'T BE COLD ONE MORE
SECOND.
I WAS THANKFUL LAST NIGHT
THAT WE STUCK TO OUR GUNS A
LITTLE BIT AFTER TRIBAL AND
DIDN'T RUN OVER AND JUMP IN THE
MEN'S SHELTER.
BUT GOING OVER THIS THIS
MORNING, I HAVE NO SHAME.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO MISERABLE.
I COULDN'T GET MY TAIL OVER
THERE TO THAT FIRE FAST ENOUGH.
COME ON, COME ON, GUYS.
OH, HEY, GUYS.
DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS COMING.
SORRY, GUYS.
I HOPE THIS IS A TEMPORARY
PIT STOP AT THE MEN'S CAMP.
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE GIRLS
WANT TO STAND OVER THERE.
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE MOOCHING OFF
OF THEM.
THEY'RE ALL LIKE, EXCUSE ME.
LOOK AT MY FINGERS.
THAT'S CRAZY.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
WHAT'S UP?
GOOD MORNING.
I WENT OUT CRAB HUNTING THIS
MORNING, AND CAME BACK, AND
FOUND THE GIRLS IN OUR SHELTER
UNDERNEATH OUR STUFF, SITTING ON
OUR BEDS, SOAKING WET, YOU KNOW,
SITTING BY OUR FIRE.
I GET IT, THEY HAD A TOUGH
NIGHT.
I THINK SOME OF THE GUYS ARE
SENSITIVE TO THAT, BUT THERE'S
BARELY ROOM FOR NINE GUYS IN
THAT SHELTER AND THERE'S NO
EXTRA ROOM, AND THAT MEANS FOR
THE GIRLS, THEIR DAY IS DONE.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE.
YES.
YES.
Jeff: HERE'S WOW IT WORKS.
ONE AT A TIME TRIBE MEMBERS WILL
SQUARE OFF IN A MEMORY TEST.
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SERIES
OF ITEMS IN A SPECIFIC ORDER.
WHEN YOU'VE MEMORIZED THEM,
YOU'LL PULL A LEVER, DROP A
CURTAIN, THEN RACE TO RECREATE
THE SAME SERIES IN THE SAME
ORDER.
FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT
SCORES A POINT FOR THEIR TRIBE.
FIRST TRIBE TO FIVE WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
YES.
Jeff: A COMPLETE FISHING
SUPPLY KIT AND A CANOE WITH
PADDLES WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP.
IN ADDITION, CLEARLY, YOU ARE
PLAYING FOR MOMENTUM.
GUYS, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA MEN,
SITTING TWO PEOPLE OUT.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SIT OUT?
TARZAN AND LEIF CAN SIT OUT.
Jeff: TARZAN AND LEIF, TAKE
A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
EVERYBODY ELSE, GIVE YOU A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, FIRST TWO, COME ON
UP.
SABRINA WILL BE TAKING ON MATT.
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU
DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU LOOK AT
THE ITEMS.
WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH,
EITHER ONE OF YOU CAN DROP THE
CURTAIN AND THAT DROPS IT ON
BOTH OF YOU.
YOU GUYS READY?
HERE WE GO.
WOW, NEITHER ONE OF THEM TOOK
MUCH TIME.
IT WAS A VERY FAST LOOK.
MATT IS BACK FIRST.
LET'S SEE IF HE HAS IT RIGHT.
MATT HAS IT WRONG.
SABRINA HAS IT RIGHT.
WOMEN SCORE THE FIRST POINT.
é
( APPLAUSE )
WOMEN LEAD, 1-ZIP.
SEND UP THE NEXT TWO.
COLTON WILL TAKE ON MONICA.
HERE WE GO.
COLTON LOOKED AT THAT FOR ABOUT
HALF A SECOND.
IT'S A RACE, BOTH HUSTLING.
COLTON IS BACK FIRST, MONICA
RIGHT BEHIND.
LET'S SEE IF COLTON HAS IT
RIGHT.
HE DOES NOT.
LET'S SEE IF MONICA HAS IT
RIGHT.
MONICA HAS IT RIGHT FOR THE
WOMEN.
WOMEN LEAD 2-ZIP.
é
( APPLAUSE )
NEXT TWO.
ALICIA TAKING ON JAY.
THE MEN HAVE YET TO SCORE.
HERE WE GO.
ONCE AGAIN, SIX ITEMS.
WOW, ALICIA WAS QUICK OUT OF THE
GATE ON THAT ONE.
ALICIA NOT MESSING AROUND.
ALICIA GOING TO COMMIT.
WHO GETS TO THE MAT FIRST?
ALICIA GETS TO THE MAT JUST
AHEAD OF JAY.
THE WOMEN ARE RIGHT AGAIN.
é
( CHEERS )
WOMEN LEAD 3-ZIP.
NEXT TWO, COME UP ON.
KAT TAKING ON TROYZAHN, LAST
ROUND WAS SIX ITEMS.
WE'RE GOING TO BUMP IT UP.
EIGHT ITEMS.
WHAT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
TROYZAHN, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
THE MEN CONTINUE TO BE PATHETIC
IN THIS.
THE WOMEN DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT,
EITHER.
RE-RACK AND WE'LL GO AGAIN.
HERE WE GO.
TROYZAHN IS NOT RIGHT.
KAT IS NOT RIGHT.
RE-RACK AND WE GO AGAIN.
KAT THINKS SHE HAS IT RIGHT.
NO.
MEN HAVE IT WRONG AS WELL.
RE-RACK, WE GO AGAIN.
SHE IS WRONG.
HE IS WRONG.
NO, WRONG.
NO, RE-RACK.
RE-RACK.
GO AGAIN.
FOR THE SEVENTH TIME, TROYZAHN
VERSUS KAT.
KAT WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THE
LEAD FOR THE WOMEN.
TROYZAN HOPING HE CAN PUT THE
MEN ON THE BOARD, KAT NOT
MESSING AROUND.
SHE'S BACK VERY QUICKLY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, TROYZAN, KAT
HAS IT RIGHT FOR THE WOMEN.
WOMEN ARE DOMINATING.
THEY LEAD 4-ZIP.
NEXT TWO, COME ON UP.
CHRISTINA VERSUS BILL.
HERE'S WHERE WE STAND.
MEN HAVE NOT EVEN GOTTEN ON THE
BOARD, BILL.
ALL RIGHT.
Jeff: IF YOU LOSE THIS
CHALLENGE IS OVER.
THAT'S IT?
OKAY, OKAY.
Jeff: YOU MUST WIN TO KEEP
THE MEN ALIVE.
LET'S GO.
WOMEN CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.
BILL HAS ALREADY TAKEN OFF.
BILL WANTS TO KEEP THE MEN ALIVE
IN THIS.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BEAT
CHRISTINA.
CHRISTINA WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE IT
OUT RIGHT NOW.
GO HOME WITH THE WOMEN'S FIRST
VICTORY IN THIS GAME.
BILL COMING BACK.
CHRISTINA WAS BACK FIRST.
THINKS SHE HAS IT RIGHT.
SHE DOES.
WOMEN WIN REWARD!
LADIES, NICE WORK.
GET YOUR REWARD.
THE CANOE WILL BE WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT CAMP.
YOU DO NOT NEED TO SHARE IT.
IT IS YOUR CANOE.
BUT ONE THING HAS CHANGED AS A
RESULT OF THIS MORNING'S
CHALLENGE IT'S WOMEN NOW KNOW
THEY CAN BEAT YOU AT SOMETHING.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
CAMP.
OH, MY GOD!
THERE'S OUR BOAT!
WHO-HOO!
SO AWESOME.
WE WON OUR FIRST CHALLENGE.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,
DEFINITELY WHAT WE NEEDED TO
PICK UP THE TRIBE.
WE CAME BACK TO THIS HORRIBLE
WEATHER.
THE PLAN IS TO GET THE FIRE
GOING, FIX OUR SHELTER, YOU
KNOW, KEEP EVERYBODY WARM,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON THE
VERGE OF, YOU KNOW, A HORRIBLE
STORM RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
GOOD GRIEF.
I WONDER HOW LONG THIS IS
GOING TO LAST.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE HAVE A
BIG QUESTION FOR YOU.
YEAH.
ALL OF OUR COCONUTS ARE WET.
WE'RE TRYING TO START A FIRE.
WE CAN'T DO THE MAGNESIUM BAR
BECAUSE THE INSIDE IS DAMP.
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN POSSIBLY
HAVE AN EMBER?
CAN WE TAKE OUT THE CANOE
SOMETIMES.
WE CAN'T MAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?
.
YOU GUYS WERE ALL HERE
HANGING AROUND THE FIRE THIS
MORNING AND THAT WAS A BIG DEAL.
GUYS, WE HAVE RAIN POURING IN
OUR SHELTER.
WE DO, TOO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE
UNREASONABLE.
I'M FREEZING.
THEY HAVE TO GIVE US
SOMETHING, MAN.
OTHERWISE ALL THIS STUFF IS
GOING TO STOP.
SOME OF THE GUYS ARE LIKE WE
HAVE TO STOP GIVING THEM STUFF
AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING IN
RETURN WHICH I DO AGREE WITH.
I LOVE SOME OF THOSE GIRLS BUT
IF THEY'RE NOT GIVING US
THINGS-- I AM A REPUBLICAN, I AM
NOTE A DEMOCRAT.
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN HANDOUTS.
IT IS RAINING REALLY HARD,
AND MY HANDS ARE INCREDIBLY
WATERLOGGED.
MY FEET ARE PROBABLY WORSE.
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THOSE YET.
WE'RE JUST MISERABLE RIGHT
NOW.
AND HOPEFULLY THE RAIN LETS UP A
LITTLE BIT.
IF THIS WAS A LIFE-OR-DEATH
SITUATION, OBVIOUSLY, WE WOULD
HELP THEM.
I WOULD HELP HUMANS OUT.
THIS IS A ( BLEEP ) GAME.
EVERY TIME WE GIVE THEM FIRE--
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ASK FOR
ANYTHING.
NO, WE JUST WANT TO GET WARM.
Y'ALL DON'T HAVE FIRE YET?
SORRY, I'M JUST SO DRENCHED I
NEED, LIKE FIVE SECONDS OUT OF
RAIN AND THEN I WILL BE OUT OF
YOUR WAY.
THE GIRLS ARE BEYOND A MESS.
THEY'RE, LIKE, ZOMBIES, YOU
KNOW, LIKE SHIVERING.
AND I'M, LIKE, LET THEM TOUGH IT
OUT.
THE BOAT'S REALLY COOL.
WE PLAN ON TAKING IT OUT ONE
DAY SOON.
WHEN Y'ALL AREN'T USING IT?
YOU ARE?
I DON'T KNOW.
DIDN'T YOU JUST WALK AWAY
WITH FIRE A WHILE AGO?
AREN'T YOU STANDING HERE
RIGHT NOW?
YES OR NO.
YES OR NO.
REALLY, STRAIGHT UP.
I'M JUST GOING TO BE HONEST.
I JUST DON'T THINK YOUR DEALS
ARE FAIR.
FAIR.
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COOK
ANYTHING IF IT WEREN'T FOR US.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT.
WE'RE NOT ASK TO BORROW.
WE'RE ASKING IF WE CAN USE IT.
I THING IS, I CAN'T MAKE A
DECISION UNLESS I LET THEM ALL
KNOW.
AWLIME SAYING--
I WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.
DON'T COME AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY.
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT ALL
THAT SERIOUS.
I'M JUST SAYING.
OH, NO VOTE, AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE GIVEN TO YOU, THAT'S HOW
IT'S GOING TO BE?
SO WHEN YOU WANT FIRE, WHEN YOU
WANT SHELTER, YOU USE YOUR
WOMENLY CHARMS TO TAKE CARE OF
THOSE SITUATIONS.
BUT WHEN WE ASK FOR A BOAT, YOU
SAY NO?
ONE WORLD IS OUT THE WINDOW.
GO BACK AND DISCUSS OUR PLAN
WITH THEM.
GO BACK AND ASK ABOUT THE DEAL
AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY.
AND THEN COME BACK WITH A
CONSENSUS, AND THEN WE'LL SETTLE
IT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU.
SHE'S AN IDIOT.
THEY THINK IT'S LIKE--
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COME
ACROSS AS SPOILED KIND OF LIKE,
"WHERE'S MY STUFF?
WHERE'S MY FIRE?
COME BUILD ME.
COME HELP ME."
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, LIKE,
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S THE THING.
WE'RE MEN, THEY'RE WOMEN.
THEY THINK DIFFERENT.
NO, BECAUSE EVEN I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
THOSE BOYS SAID SINCE THEY
GAVE US THAT EMBER--
EMBER, THEY WANT US TO LET
THEM USE THE CANOE.
THEY WANT TO TAKE THE CANOE
OUT AND WE BETTER DISCUSS IT OR
THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE IT OUT.
THAT WASN'T NEGOTIATED AT
ALL.
THEY SAID--
I NEEDED JUST FIVE SECONDS TO
TRY TO DRY MY HANDS OUT, AND ALL
THEY DID WAS BITCH AT US, LIKE--
WHAT HAPPENED.
WE STILL NEED THINGS SO,
HERE, WE DON'T HAVE THE WOOD--
I WOULD GIVE THEM ALL OUR
FISHING GEAR AND THAT FREAK,
BOAT.
I JUST WANT TO SLEEP ON ONE
FREAKING NIGHT BEFORE I LOSE MY
MIND.
I'M LOSING IT.
LIKE, I'M SO FREAKING COLD.
WE'RE JUST-- WE'RE GIRLS.
WE'RE JUST NOT MEANT TO BE,
LIKE, BEATEN DOWN THIS WELL.
LIKE, BEATEN DOWN THIS WELL.
LET'S GO FISH THERE.
THIS MORNING, THE SUN FINALLY
CAME UP SO WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED
TO PUT OUR REWARD TO USE AND
LEARN TO SPEAR FISH AND GET OUR
CONFIDENCE IN THAT SO WE KNOW WE
CAN GO OUT AND CATCH A FISH IF
WE'RE HUNGRY.
GOOD JOB!
I GOT IT.
IT'S LITTLE BUT AT LEAST IT'S
SOMETHING.
IT'S A LITTLE SURPRISING HOW
THINGS ARE KIND OF TURNING
AROUND.
IT FEELS AWESOME.
ALL THREE OF US WENT OUT AND WE
ALL THREE CAUGHT A FISH.
THEY WEREN'T VERY BIG BUT WE DID
IT.
WHOOO!
GOOD WORK, GIRLS!
THINGS ARE STARTING TO FEEL
DIFFERENT.
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE GET WHY
THEY'RE HERE.
BEFORE IT FELT LIKE WHERE AM I?
WHAT AM I DOING?
YOU CAUGHT A FISH YOU DID
THAT FROM THE BOAT?
I THINK THE GIRLS ARE FEELING
MORE CONFIDENT.
YOU KNOW, THEY GOT THEIR FEET
UNDER THEM.
CONGRATULATIONS.
AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE
WAY WE FEEL, THE GUYS FEEL.
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO WIN AGAIN

TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
YOU WILL LOSE YOUR FIRST TRIBE
MEMBER.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
MY MIND WAS JUST BLOWN.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WE LOST.
BUT NOW THAT WE'VE LOST THIS
CHALLENGE, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO DOING THIS.
I MEAN I'VE SPENT EIGHT DAYS OUT
HERE CREATING SOME POWER AND I
WANT TO USE IT AND I WANT TO
EXECUTE SOME OF IF TONIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
é
( CHEERS )
THAT WAS AWESOME!
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT
THEM?
GOOD WORK!
OH, MY GOD.
WAS THAT A COME FROM BEHIND
OR WHAT?
TODAY I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE
IT WAS A COMMUNICATION-TYPE
CHALLENGE, BUT WE PULLED
THROUGH.
OH.
OH.
I KNOW.
THANKS, LEIF.
WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT YOU COULD
TELL THE
BOYS THOUGHT THEY HAD IT IN THE
BAG BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FAR
AHEAD.
AND SO NOW THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST
ALL RUNNING AROUND LIKE CHICKENS
WITH THEIR HEADS CUT OFF, NOT
KNOWING WHAT TO DO.
BILL?
YES, SIR.
DID YOU A GREAT JOB.
YEAH, GOOD JOB.
THANKS, GUYS, I APPRECIATE
IT.
I LOST MY VOICE ON THAT-- ON
THAT CALLING FOR SURE.
I'M SO EXCITED TO VOTE
SOMEONE OUT.
I DISLIKE SO MANY OF THESE
PEOPLE.
LIKE, BILL, SCREWED UP IN THE
CHALLENGE TODAY.
I'M SORRY, YOU HAD A GOOD, LIKE,
FIVE- TO SEVEN-MINUTE LEAD OVER
THOSE WOMEN, AND YOU STILL LOST.
DUDE, THAT'S A KNOT IN THERE,
DUDE.
OPEN IT.
THAT'S JUST MOCK, BRO.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.
"YO, BRO.
BRO."
SHUT UP.
GO KILL YOURSELF.
ALL HE'S DOING IT DIG HIMSELF A
GRAVE.
YOU'RE GOING FISHING!
I CAME RIGHT AT THAT PRECISE
TIME.
IT'S SO AMAZING.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
I DON'T LIKE YOU, STAY AWAY FROM
ME.
YOU'RE GHETTO TRASH.
THAT'S ALL YOU ARE.
I CAN'T STAND HIM, UGGGG, AND I
WANT HIM GONE, YESTERDAY.
OKAY, THIS RIGHT HERE, ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.
THIS IS OUR FIVE, SOLIDIFIED.
ABSOLUTELY.
PLUS A FLOATER.
WHO IS OUR FLOATER?
YOU KNOW, BILL.
IS GOING FIRST.
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE'S TOO WISHY-WASHY.
OKAY, BUT WHY DON'T WE MAKE
HIM SECOND.
MATT SAY REAL DANGER.
BILL IS THE TYPE THAT WILL
SLIP UP BEHIND YOU AND SLIT YOUR
THROAT.
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT, DON'T
WE?
YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT,
FIRST.
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE CLEARLY
TWO SIDES IN OUR TRIBE.
THERE'S MATT, MIKE, JAY, AND
BILL.
AND THEN THERE'S ME AND JONAS,
TARZAN, LEIF, AND COLTON.
WE'VE GOT THE NUMBERS, SO THE
GUYS IN THE ALLIANCE BASICALLY
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PICKING WHO
IS GOING HOME.
IF IT'S GOING TO BE MATT, IT'S
GOING TO BE MATT.
IF THEY SWITCH IT AND SAY IT'S
GOING TO BE BILL, IT'S GOING TO
BE BILL.
AND REALLY THE ONE MAKING THE
BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS COLTON.
EVERYBODY'S OUT CHATTING.
I FIGURED I'D COME SEE WHAT
EVERYBODY IS CHATTING ABOUT.
AND IT GOT QUIET WHEN I WALKED
UP SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME--
WELL, WE'RE NOT VOTING YOU
OUT, SO DON'T WORRY.
IS IT YOU GUYS RIGHT HERE?
IT MIGHT BE.
( LAUGHS )
DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH US?
WE ALL LIKE YOU.
I THINK YOU JUST BACK THE
WRONG HORSE.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT--
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT ON
THE TICKET RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU MAKE A DECISION WHILE
YOU'RE STANDING THERE.
JAY BIRD.
IF THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS AND
I'M NOT A PART OF THAT, THAT
PUTS A TARGET ON MY BACK, SO I
CAN EITHER JOIN THEM OR BUTT
HEADS WITH THEM, SO I BASICALLY
HAD NO OPTIONS AND SAID, "OKAY,
I'LL VOTE WITH YOU GUYS."
IT SEEMS LIKE THE CONSENSUS
IS BILL AT THE MOMENT.
THAT THE NAME.
I'M COOL WITH THAT?
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?
YEAH.
THE BEST GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN
MATT, BUT WE'RE A TEAM, IF YOU
GUYS WANT TO DO BILL, WE'LL DO
BILL.
HERE COMES MATT.
WHAT'S ALL THE DEEP THOUGHT
ABOUT?
WE'RE-- WE'RE-- TO BE HONEST,
WE'RE TALKING STRATEGIES.
OKAY.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
SEEMS PRETTY OBVIOUS.
YEAH.
IS MY PRESENCE DESTROYING THE
STRATEGY TALK?
NO.
YES, IT IS, AT THE MOMENT.
WELL IT IS.
.
I WALKED UP INTENTIONALLY ON
THESE GUYS HAVING A
CONVERSATION.
CLEARLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
ABOUT STRATEGY, SO I JUST WANTED
TO STICK MY HEAD IN IT AND SHAKE
IT UP.
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TALKING LIKE
THAT WHEN I'M NOT INVOLVED.
I WALKED UP THERE AND IT GOT
QUIET.
I'LL LEAVE YOU BOYS BE.
I WALKED AWAY, NO PROBLEM.
WHAT I DID WANT TO DO IS PULL
TROY ASIDE.
YOU WANT TO TALK ALONE?
YEAH.
TROY AND I SPENT THE LAST
WEEK AS THE HEADS OF TWO SNAKES
THAT ARE BATTLING EACH OTHER.
YOU'RE EITHER WITH ME AND MY
GUYS OR YOU'RE WITH TROY.
AND I'VE DECIDED THAT SOMETHING
HAD TO BE SAID.
WELL, THERE WAS-- THIS
CONCEPT OF LET'S GET RID OF ALL
THE MUSCLE.
IT'S CONVINIENT, JUST LIKE IT'S
CONVENIENT FOR ALL THE MUSCLE TO
BAND TOGETHER.
OF COURSE.
BUT IT'S EASY.
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH A SMALLER GROUP OF GUYS.
RIGHT.
THAT WE INTEND ON DIVING DEEP
INTO THIS GAME WITH.
ME, YOU, JAY, MAYBE MIKE, MAYBE
ONE OTHER GUY.
ALL OF US ARE ROOSTERS AND WE
DON'T WANT ANY OTHER ROOSTERS
WITH ME.
THE CHICKENS, THEY CAN'T BREAK
UP THE ROOSTERS.
AND THAT'S HOW I SAW IT FROM DAY
ONE AND, FRANKLY, I SAW YOU AS
PART OF THE ROOSTERS.
I WOULD LOVE TO CREATE A NEW
REALITY AND LET ALL THE IDIOTS
SCRAMBLE AND GET RID OF COLTON.
THE GUYS IN POWER ARE GOING
TO VOTE FOR COLTON AND WHEN WE
GET BACK TO CAMP THEY'RE GOING
TO REALIZE THE AVERAGE JOES ARE
NOT CALLING THE SHOTS AND THINGS
HAVE CHANGED AROUND HERE AND I'M
STILL IN THE FRONT OF OF IT.
WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE AND WE'LL
BE SAFE AND HIT THE MERGE AND
HOPEFULLY TAKE OUT THE CHICKS.
MATT BASICALLY SAY JERK.
HE CALLS THE STRONGEST GUYS THE
ROOSTERS AND THE WHOLE TIME I'M
AGREEING WITH HIM BUT IN MY MIND
I'M LIKE I AM NEVER GOING TO BE
WITH YOU.
IT AIN'T "SURVIVOR" UNLESS
YOU'RE LYING.
HE WANTS ME, MIKE, JAY, AND
JONAS.
AS AN ALLIANCE.
MATT IS SO DANGEROUS TO ME,
DUDE.
IT'S LIKE, WHEN HE TALKS HE'S
LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT TO
DO.
AND I'M TIRED OF THE SMALL
LITTLE PEOPLE.
US ROOSTERS WALK AROUND--" AND
HE INCLUDED ME WITH THE ROOSTER
GROUP.
I THINK MATT IS SO POWER
HUNGRY--
YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET RID
OF MATT BEFORE WE GET RID OF
BILL?
WELL, EVERYBODY WANTS TO VOTE
FOR BILL.
RIGHT NOW, THE VOTE IS
BETWEEN BILL AND MATT.
IF I HAD MY WAY BILL WOULD GO
BECAUSE HE'S ANNOYING AND I HATE
HIM AND I HATE HIS VOICE AND I
CAN'T STAND TO LISTEN TO HIM
TALK.
MATT, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS LIKE
THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE AND YOU
HAVE TO CHOP OFF THE HEAD OF
SNAKE FOR THE REST OF IT TO
STOP-- WHATSOEVER-- WIGGLING.
ARE YOU READY TO GO, BOSS?
OH, MY GOD.
EITHER ONE MAKES ME PERFECTLY
HAPPY.
HONESTLY, OUT OF THIS TRIBE OF
NINE, IF I COULD GET RID OF,
LIKE, FIVE PEOPLE, IT WOULD BE
HEAVEN.
HEAVEN.
Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH AND
APPROACH THE FLAME.
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SO, MICHAEL, WITH NINE GUYS,
THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF
A POWER STRUGGLE, AT LEAST
INITIALLY.
YOU KNOW, THE DYNAMICS JUST
KIND OF CAME TOGETHER.
LIKE, ME AND MATT CLICKED
INSTANTLY.
HE'S SOMEBODY YOU CAN WORK WITH.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
ALLIANCES GOING IN THIS TRIBE.
IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF.
Jeff: TARZAN, SO ONLY EIGHT
GAMES WITHIN THIS GAME THERE ARE
FRACTIONS WITHIN THIS GROUP OF
NINE.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, WE
HAVE AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE AND I
TRUST THOSE FIVE.
AND I THINK WE'LL STICK
TOGETHER.
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
Jeff: SO, COLTON, IF
THERE'S AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE
THAT'S STRONG, MATH SAYS THE
OTHER FOUR WOULD BE IN TROUBLE.
WELL, I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
Jeff: AND WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL.
THE GIRLS GAVE IT TO ME.
Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY IT--
YEAH.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE A JAMES.
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE AN IDOL
AND GO HOME.
THAT'S STUPID.
Jeff: MICHAEL, IS THERE A
THOUGHT THAT AN IDOL AT CAMP IS
TOO DISRUPTIVE SO LET'S THROW
SOME VOTES JUST TO MAKE SURE WE
GET IT OUT.
THAT'S ON A LOT OF OUR MINDS.
COLTON, HE'S COLTON.
THIS WHOLE TIME HE'S WORKED WITH
TWO TRIBES.
HE WAS SLEEPING OVER THERE,
EATING OVER THERE AND WE DIDN'T
KNOW WHICH WAY IT WAS GOING AND
THEN HE HAS AN IDOL ON OUR SIDE
SO IT'S DISRUPTING THE WHOLE
GAME.
Jeff: COLTON, YOU'VE BEEN
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH THE
WOMEN.
WELL, YEAH, THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A SHOCK.
Jeff: WAIT, A SECOND, WHY
SHOULDN'T THAT BE A SHOCK?
ARE YOU ON THE MEN'S TRIBE.
ALL OF MY FRIENDS AT HOME ARE
GIRLS.
Jeff: YOU'RE NOT ON THEIR
TRIBE.
YOU DON'T COMPETE WITH THEM.
YOU DON'T GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,
AND SO YOU LOOK AT ME AND SAY,
"DUUH."
TTS A REVERSE DUUH, DOUBLE DARE
ON YOU.
HERE'S THE THING, WOMEN ARE
MORE, LIKE, NURTURING AND THEY
PET AND YOU THEY TELL YOU, YOU
KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
Jeff: DO YOU REALIZE WHAT
KIND OF A TARGET YOU PUT ON YOUR
BACK WHEN YOU SAY THAT?
WELL, YEAH, BUT THAT
DISTRIBUTE MEAN I'M GOING TO
VOTE WITH THOSE WOMEN.
Jeff: BILL, EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW THIS MAKES SENSE.
I MEAN, HONESTLY, AS MUCH AS
HE ASSUMED THAT WE SPOT ON
JUDGED HIM.
HE SPOT ON JUDGED US AND ASSUMED
WE WOULDN'T TAKE HIM IN --
YOU MEAN, BECAUSE HE'S GAY?
YEAH.
Jeff: TARZAN.
HERE'S WHAT WE DISCOVERED.
COLTON'S HIGHLY INTELLIGENT.
HE'S INVALUABLE WITH REGARD TO
UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS GAME
PLAYS.
HE ALREADY HAS ALLEGIANCES WITH
FEMALES OVER THERE, AND WHEN WE
COMBINE, HE'S ALREADY SAID.
HE'S REAL SMART.
IF WE VALUE OUR SURVIVAL WE NEED
HIM IN THE FIRST FEW PLAYS HERE.
WHO IS "WE," TARZAN.
I'M TALK, I USED THE WORD
"WE" IN A GENERAL SENSE.
I'M TRYING TO HELP COLTON DEFEND
HIS STATUS BECAUSE I BELIEVE
HE'S VERY VALUABLE AND I THINK
OUR TEAM WILL PROSPER IF HE
STAYS HERE A BIT LONGER.
Jeff: AND, MATT, YOU'RE NOT
BUYING IT.
WELL, I THINK TARZAN HAS, YOU
KNOW, PUT OUT A CRY FOR HELP TO
WHOEVER IT IS THE FIVE GUYS WHO
ARE WITH HIM.
AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE TARZAN IS
SHIVERING IN HIS BOOTS OVER
HERE, AND I'M JUST GETTING SICK
OF HIM USING VAGUE TERMS AND
WANT HIM TO TALK TURKEY.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
THAT'S NOT THE MOTIVE BEHIND
WHAT I'M SAYING.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
MY HEART IS BROKEN THAT HE
MISINTERPRETS ME.
Jeff: MATT, ARE YOU
ENJOYING THIS GAME?
BECAUSE YOU SEEM A LITTLE
AGITATED.
WELL, YEAH, SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID HERE
TONIGHT AGITATE ME, MAINLY
TARZAN.
TARZAN IS ALWAYS TALKING.
EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS LAUGHING AT
TARZAN BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS
TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY.
I WANT PEOPLE TO LISTEN AND TAKE
ME SERIOUSLY.
Jeff: DO YOU THINK PEOPLE
TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY?
I DO.
Jeff: HOW WILL TONIGHT'S
VOTE CHANGE THIS GAME FOR YOU?
WE ALL GET ONE CHANCE TO MAKE
A MOVE THAT SETS THE BALL IN
MOTION, AND THAT'S TONIGHT.
I THINK THE GAME DOES CHANGE ALL
THE TIME.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE WILLING TO
REASSESS AND ALWAYS BE CHANGING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
Jeff: BILL, HOW CONCERNED
ARE YOU THAT TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL
NOT GO THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO
GO?
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL FUN AND
GAMES UNTIL YOU'RE RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN, LIKE, THIS IS INTENSE,
MAN.
THIS IS EMOTION RIGHT HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE, WE'RE SITTING HERE.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO GO
HOME.
I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT TO
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M SO JACKED UP RIGHT NOW.
I MIGHT GO HOME.
I MIGHT NOT.
BUT I AM SO HAPPY I GOT TO PLAY
THIS GAME, MAN.
LIKE, THIS IS REAL INTENSE AND
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE THIS,
MAN.
I'M SO READY TO DO THIS.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WITH THAT,
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JONAS, YOU'RE UP.
JONAS, YOU'RE UP.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, COLTON.
BILL.
MATT.
THAT'S ONE VOTE MATT, ONE VOTE
COLTON, ONE VOTE BILL.
MATT.
TWO VOTES MATT.
MATT.
THAT'S THREE VOTES MATT.
MATT.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES MATT.
ONE VOTE COLTON, ONE VOTE BILL.
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: ONE WORLD."
MATT, THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
MATT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
FIRST VOTE, FIRST BLINDSIDE.
GAME ON.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
JEFF?
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?
Jeff: WHAT?
CAN WE HEAR THE LAST TWO
VOTES?
Jeff: NO.
SAVE THOSE QUESTIONS FOR ME.

JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
WE HAVE A BETRAYAL.
OH, MY--
THE MONANO TRIBE HAS LOST
THEIR MARBLES.
YOU WILL BE FIRST TO GO IN
SUCH AN EGREGIOUS BREECH OF
FAITH.
THAT'S A HASTY DECISION.
I'M THINKING WHAT?
YOU GOT THAT.
NO.
I WANT HIM GONE.
I TOLD YOU TO PICK A SIDE AND
YOU PICKED THE WRONG SIDE.
I WANT HIS HEAD ON A PLATTER.
ONE OUT, YOU KNOW, EIGHT DAYS
IS AN INCREDIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT.
YOU KNOW I CAME OUT HERE WITH
BIG EXPECTATIONS AND A PLAN TO
DO IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR
ME.
BUT I THOUGHT IN THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS I HAD REWORKED SOMETHING
WITH TROY TO GET THE NUMBERS
BACK IN MY FAVOR, AND CLEARLY, I
WAS WRONG.
I WAS PROBABLY ENEMY NUMBER ONE
THE BIGGEST THREAT THEY HAD AND
IT SPELLED MY DISASTER
