 --- 

         SURVIVOR IS THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST REALITY COMPETITION.
AND IT'S BEEN PLAYED BY SOME
OF THE BIGGEST PERSONALITIES
ON TELEVISION.
 JEFF, I'M A FORMER
SPECIAL AGENT.
 ARE YOU A CRAZY PERSON.
 SOME ARE HEROES.
SOME ARE VILLAINS.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING SCREW ME








OR THERE WILL BE
CONSEQUENCES.
 SOME ARE UNDERDOGS.
 I WANT TO HAVE CONTROL.
 AND THIS SEASON 10 OF
THEM CAME BACK TO PROVE THEY
FINALLY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO WIN THE MILLION DOLLARS.
 THE GAME OF THE SEASON IS
PEOPLE THAT MAKE BIG
MISTAKES.
 THIS IS A CHANCE TO
CORRECT THOSE MISTAKES.
 Jeff: THE STANDING








BETWEEN THEM AND THE PRIZE
WERE 10 NEW SUPERFANS.
WELCOME TO SURVIVOR "FANS
VS. FAVORITES" 2.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: AND RIGHT OFF THE
BAT IT WAS CLEAR THE FANS
HAD NO INTENTION OF BACKING
DOWN.
 I'M DEFINITELY HERE TO
WIN THE GAME.
 FANS NEED ONE MORE.
FANS WIN FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE!
AT THE FAVORITES CAMP.
 IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AS
A SPECIALIST.
 PHILLIP PUT TOGETHER AN
UNBREAKABLE ALLIANCE CALLED
STEALTH "R" US.
 THE ELIMINATER, THE
DOMINATRIX, AND TRUE GRIT.
 Jeff: AND STEALTH RU WENT
RIGHT TO WORK.
THE NEW FRANCESCA HOME
FIRST.
 FRANCESCA, FOR HER SECOND
TIME IN A ROW.
 THE TRIBE LAS SPOKEN.
 AGAIN.
 Jeff: AT THE FANS CAMP
EDDIE AND REYNOLD ASSEMBLED
THE COOL KID AS LINES.
 EVERYBODY AT THE-- I
DON'T ANYBODY ELSE WILL BE
AT OUR TABLE.
 Jeff: THEY QUICKLY FOUND
OUT THIS WASN'T HIGH SCHOOL
THIS WAS SURVIVOR.
 I WAS PICKED AGAIN.
 Jeff: SHERRI ASSEMBLED A
MAJORITY ALLIANCE BREAKING
UP THE COOL KIDS.
 THE HOPE THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 Jeff: LEAVING ED YEAR AND
REYNOLD STUCK ON THE BOTTOM.
 REVENGE OF THE NERDS.
 Jeff: FORTUNATELY FOR
THEM, THERE WAS A BIGGER
TARGET,.
 SHUT UP.
STOP TALKING.
YOU JUST SAID I WASN'T THE
ONLY ONE WHO SAID IT.
 YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE IT A
DEEP DARK STORY AS MUCH AS
YOU WANT BUT SHAMAR IS A BIG
BABY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO
IT.
 Jeff: BUT BEFORE HIS
TRIBE COULD VOTE HIM OUT.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SCRATCHED MY EYEBALL.
 Jeff: AN EYE INJURY TOOK
HIM FROM THE GAME.
 I DID MY BEST, IT'S JUST
A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: THE FAVORITES HAVE
A DISTRACTION OF THEIR OWN.
BRANDON.
 I WILL PEE IN THE RICE,
IN THE BEAN, I WILL BURN THE
SHELL TER TO THE GROUND.
HE SUFFERED ONE OF THE
BIGGEST MELTDOWNS IN
SURVIVOR HISTORY.
 HE SAW HIS GAME COME TO
AN END AT AN IMPROMPTU
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 Jeff: 6th PERSON VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME BRANDON
HASN'T.
-- HANTZ.
WHEN THE TWO TRIBES MERGED
PHILLIP STEALTH "R" US HAD A
PLAN TO CONTINUE THEIR
DOMINANCE.
 LAYING IN BED TONIGHT,
PRETEND YOU ARE-- AROUND,
THAT IS WHAT I DO.
 Jeff: IT WAS CALLED THE
BOSTON ROB RULES.
 RULE ONE WOULD BE DO YOU
HAVE AN ALLIANCE.
BR RULE TWO, GET THAN
ALLIANCE WITHIN THE ALLIANCE.
 -- DAWN AND ME.
BR RULE THREE, GET RID OF
YOUR ALLIANCE BEFORE IT GETS
RID OF YOU.
 Jeff: THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
BUT WHAT THE BR RULES
COULDN'T ACCOUNT FOR WAS ONE
OF THE BIGGEST MOVES EVER
MADE IN 26 SEASONS OF
SURVIVOR.
 THIS IS THE OTHER
IMMUNITY IDOL SI HAVE BEEN
HANGING ON TO.
I'M GIVING IT TO EDDIE.
THE THREE OF US ARE VOTING
FOR PHILLIP.
 Jeff: THE THREE AMIGOS
PLAYED TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS AND FLIPPED GAME ON
ITS HEAD VOTING OUT PHILLIP
THE LEADER OF STEALTH "R" US.
 Jeff: PHILLIP, THE TO BE
REHAS SPOKEN.
WITH PHILLIP GONE THE A
JORITY BEGAN TO TURN ON EACH
OTHER.
 I THINK TODAY IS THE
BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE
ALLIANCE OF SIX.
 Jeff: BUT COCHRAN AND
DAWN STAYED LOYAL TO EACH
OTHER.
THEY PULLED IN SHERRI AND
WORKED TOGETHER AT
CONTROLLING THE REMAINDER OF
THE VOTES TAKING OUT THEIR
BIGGEST THREATS ONE AFTER
ANOTHER.
 THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 Jeff: WITH THE END IN
SIGHT, EVERYONE BEGAN
FALLING PART.
 HOW CAN WE LIVE OFF OF
WATER.
 Jeff: ERIK CONSIDERED
PULLING HIMSELF FROM THE
GAME.
 THESE DAYS ARE KILLING
ME.
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY KILLING
ME.
I HAVE TO HAVE FOOD.
I'M MISERABLE HERE.
I'M TRYING TO DEFEAT MYSELF
AT THIS POINT.
 I'M SO HUNGRY.
 Jeff: EDDIE WAS LEFT
ALONE TO FEND FOR HIMSELF
AFTER LOSING ALL HIS ALLIES.
 I FEEL CLEARLY ON THE
OUT.
I HAVEN'T FELT SAFE FROM DAY
ONE.
 Jeff: AND DAWN SUFFERED
AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN.
 I LOST MY BOTTOM TEETH
AND I HAVE A RETAIN THEIR
HAS MY TEETH ON THEM.
I WILL PULL MYSELF FROM THE
GAME, I'M NOT KIDDING.
 Jeff: SETTING THE GAME
ASIDE, BRENDON CAME TO HER
RESCUE.
 OH MY GOD, THERE THEY
ARE.
 Jeff: BUT THAT MOMENT OF
KINDNESS DIDN'T STOP DAWN
FROM TAKING OUT ONE LAST
THREAT.
 BRENDA.
 I KNEW.
 Jeff: YOU NEED TO BRING
ME YOUR TORCH.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 IT HURTS.
 Jeff: AFTER 36 DAYS IN
THE CARAMOAN ISLANDS ONLY
FIVE ARE LEFT.
THREE FAVORITES, TWO FANS.
 WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT TO
THE FINAL FIVE.
YOU HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT IN
THIS GAME.
AND IF THE FIRST 36 ARE ANY
INDICATION, IT'S GOING TO BE
A CRAZY FINISH.
THIS FAN TURNED FAVORITE
MADE ONE OF THE MOST MISTAKE
ITS FIRST TIME HE PLAYED.
 I WANT TO GIVE IMMUNITY
TO-- WILL HE REDEEM HIMSELF.
 I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH
THINKING ABOUT THE LAST TIME
I PLAYED THE GAME.
I'M TO THE GOING TO LET THE
SAME MISTAKE TAKE ME DOWN
AGAIN.
 Jeff: SHERRI, THE ONLY
FAN TO SUCCESSFULLY
INFILTRATE STEALTH "R" US.
 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I
ASSIGN YOU A NAME, TENACITY.
 I GAVE UP SO MUCH TIME
WITH MY FAMILY TO COME OUT
HERE.
I MEAN I HAVE TO WIN.
THEY TOTALLY UNDERESTIMATED
ME.
 Jeff: EDDIE, A TARGET
SINCE DAY ONE HAS CHARMED
HIS WAY THROUGH THE GAME.
 I VOTE FOR YOU IN THE TOP
THREE.
 YEAH.
 I LIKE YOU.
 Jeff: WILL IT BE ENOUGH?
 AS A FIREFIGHTER, I'M A
THORN, I STILL HAVE A LOT OF
MOVES.
I WILL KEEP GOING NO MATTER
WHAT.
 Jeff: COCHRAN, THE
SURVIVOR NERD HAS
TRANSFORMED INTO AN
ALL-AROUND THREAT.
 EDDIE IS OUT.
KOTION RAL -- -- COCHRAN
PULLS IT OUT.
 Jeff: WILL HE CONTINUE TO
DOMINATE CHALLENGES AND THE
GAME.
 I HAVE BEEN WATCHING
SURVIVOR WITH MY PARENTS FOR
13 YEARS.
I NEED TO WIN THIS GAME AND
I'M WILLING TO GO TO ANY
LENGTH TO MATCH THAT
TIGHT-- SNATCH THAT TITLE.
 Jeff: DAWN, SHE HAS
BATTLED HER EMOTIONS TO GET
THIS FAR.
WILL HER HEART GET IN THE
WAY OF THE MILLION DOLLAR
PRIZE?
 I'M HERE TO WIN THE
MILLION DOLLARS.
I'VE GOT SIX KIDS THAT ARE
RIDING ON IT.
SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S
TIME TO APOLOGIZE.
 Jeff: WHO WILL IT BE?
A FAN OR A FAVORITE?
IT ALL COMES TO AN END
TONIGHT.
FIND OUT WHO WILL CLAIM THE
MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE AND THE
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 AS BRENDA LEFT TRIBAL
COUNCIL I LOOKED AT ERIK AND
IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE HE WAS
ACTUALLY HOLDING HIS HEAD.
SO I THOUGHT HE'S DONE BY
THE VOTE.
BECAUSE HE WASN'T AWARE OF
IT.
 EVERYTHING IS SPINNING.
 HEY, GUYS.
 WHAT'S GOING ON, ERIK?
YOU GUYS JUST LEFT TRIBAL A
FEW MINUTES AGO.
 RIGHT.
IN THE MIDDLE OF TRIBAL I
STARTED TO SPIN AND I DIDN'T
EVEN NOTICE IT UNTIL IT WAS
LIKE HALFWAY THROUGH.
 WHEN I LOOKED AT ERIK I
SAW SOMEBODY THAT WAS VERY
DAZED AND LOOKS DISORIENTED
AND JUST KIND OF OUT OF IT.
HE WAS SWIRLING HIS HANDS
AROUND HIS HEAD.
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.
I KNOW HE IS A SUPERFAN LIKE
I AM.
 EVERYTHING IS SPINNING
LIKE RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: OKAY.
 I NEED TO LAY DOWN.
 Jeff: WE HAVE DR. JOE
HERE, JOE, COME ON IN UP.
 TRY TO EP.
 IT TURNS OUT AS WE WERE
LEAVING TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ERIC-- ERIK HAD FAINTING OR
DIZZY SPELLS AND JEFF
IMMEDIATELY CAME UP AND
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THIS
IS SERIOUS.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF HEY,
ERIK JUST NEEDS SOME
BREATHING SPACE.
 WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.
 Jeff: SO JOE, TELL ME
WHAT YOU ARE IMMEDIATELY
CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN HE IS
36 DAYS INTO THIS GAME AND
FEELING LIGHT-HEADED.
 I'M CONCERNED THAT HE'S
IN A STARVATION STATE.
I AM CONCERNED THAT HE HAS
BEEN PUSHING HIS BODY SO
HARD AND HIS BODY
COMPENSATES, THAT'S WHAT
THEY DO.
BUT THEY REACH A CERTAIN
POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T
COMPENSATE ANY MORE.
THE FACT THAT HE HAS BEEN
DIZZY AND IS ALMOST PASSED
OUT MAKES ME THINK THERE IS
NOT ENOUGH BLOOD GOING TO
HIS HEAD.
HIS PULSE IS VERY SLOW HERE.
THAT'S CONCERNING.
 Jeff: AND ERIK, HOW ARE
YOU FEELING IN THIS MOMENT?
CLEARLY YOU ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.
BUT DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
COULD EVEN STAND UP.
 I'M JUST DIZZY.
IT'S SPINNING, EVERYTHING IS
SPINNING.
 Jeff: SO WHAT IS THE
TREATMENT, DR. JOE, WHAT DO
WE DO?
 WE NEED TO PUT
INTRAVENOUS LINE INTO HIS
ARM.
 Jeff: CAN WE START THAT
NOW.
 WE CAN START THAT RIGHT
NOW.
 Jeff: LET'S START IT.
 WHAT DOES THE FLUID DO.
 IT IS BASICALLY SO YOU SO
DEHYDRATED AND MALL
NOURISHED THAT THIS IS GOING
TO PUMP A BUNCH OF SALINE
AND OTHER THINGS THROUGH
YOUR BODY.
IT WILL COOL YOU DOWN AND
MAKE YOU FEEL A LOT BETTER.
 I LOVE THAT WE HAVE AN
EMT HERE WHO IS YOUR FRIEND
WHO CAN TELL YOU WHAT
DR. JOE IS DOING WHILE HE'S
DOING IT.
 DID WE GET A BLOOD
PRESSURE.
 100 OVER 70, SO THAT'S
QUITE LOW FOR SOMEONE HIS
AGE.
 Jeff: HOW ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE IF YOU SAT
HERE A LITTLE LONGER YOU
WOULD BE OKAY AND BE ABLE TO
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 I WISH I COULD.
 Jeff: BUT JO WRIGHT NOW
IF ERIK SAID TO YOU, I DON'T
CARE, I HAVE COME TOO FAR,
I'M GOING BACK TO CAMP,
WOULD YOU SAY YES THAT'S
OKAY, OR NO, YOU'RE TO THE
GOING.
 RIGHT NOW HE'S GOING
DOWN.
AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO
ANY FURTHER.
I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND
REWARDS OF THIS GAME BUT IN
THIS CASE, NO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING.
 Jeff: DR. JOE, YOU'VE
OFFICIALLY PULLED ERIK FROM
THE GAME.
BROTHER, AFTER 36 DAYS IN
YOUR SECOND TIME PLAYING,
YOUR SECOND TIME, YOU
STARTED AS A FAN, YOU ENDED
UP AS A FAVORITE, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO FINISH THIS ONE
EITHER.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: SO WE'RE NOW DOWN
TO FOUR.
THIS GAME JUST GOT ROCKED
AGAIN.
 IT'S THROWN ME FOR A
LOOP.
ALL THE PLANS ARE GONE NOW.
MY FOCUS IS ON ERIK.
I DON'T EVEN-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TOMORROW IS GOING TO
BRING.
I THOUGHT A FEW MINUTES AGO
I KNEW WHAT TOMORROW WAS
GOING TO BRING.
NOW I HAVE NO IDEA.
SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU GUYS TO
TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY
GOOD-BYE.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET BACK
TO CAMP.
BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE THREE
DAYS LEFT IN THIS GAME.
 ERIK, GOOD LUCK.
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO WORK
OUT FOR YOU.
 I DIDN'T THINK YOU CAN DO
THIS GAME BUT YOU CAN DO
THIS GAME.
 THANK YOU.
OH, I LOVE YOU.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO
MUCH.
 COCHRAN, LAST WORDS?
 I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO
MAKE FRIENDS, I CERTAINLY
MADE A FRIEND IN YOU.
I WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO DO
THIS SHOW WITH ANYONE ELSE.
 SO PROUD OF YOU, ERIK.
 YOU ARE A CHALLENGE
MONSTER NOW.
TAKE UP THE REIGNS.
 YEAH.
 HERE'S YOUR BAG, ERIK.
 Jeff: HEAD OUT.
WELL, IN WHAT HAS BEEN A
COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE
SEASON, THIS IS ANOTHER
FIRST.
WE STILL HAVE THREE DAYS
LEFT IN THIS GAME.
YOU GUYS NOW HAVE A ONE IN
FOUR SHOT AT WINNING
SURVIVOR.
I KNOW IT'S NOT A PLEASANT
THOUGHT GIVEN THAT IT COMES
ON THE HEELS OF ERIK LEAVING,
BUT IT'S THE REALITY.
SU HAVE THREE DAYS.
SOUNDS LIKE ARE YOU LOW ON
FOOD.
YOU BETTER FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT.
THERE'S IF NO RELIEF COMING.
YOU'RE GOING TO EARN IT,
WHOEVER MAKES IT TO THE END
IS GOING TO DESERVE IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, FIND YOUR
TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
THE GAME CONTINUES.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GOOD NIGHT.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 ERIC-- ERIK IS GONE.
THERE ARE FOUR OF US NOW.
THIS OPENS THE DOOR HUGELY
FOR ME TO SNEAK IN THERE AND
MAKE A PLAY FOR THE WIN.
 TONIGHT I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING HOME AND I FEEL LIKE I
COULD WIN THIS MILLION
DOLLAR PRIZE.
THIS DEFINITELY COULD BE MY
GAME FOR THE TAKING.
 TALK ABOUT CRAZY.
 I'M IN SHOCK THAT ERIK'S
GONE.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS TOUGH.
WE VOTED OUT BRENDA.
THEN TO HAVE ERIK LEAVE,
WE'RE SAYING GOSH, THAT'S
KIND HEAVY.
IT'S A REMINDER HOW
UNPREDICTABLE THE GAME IS.
BUT I'M STILL IN IT, AND NOT
ONLY WAS IT A ONE IN FIVE
CHANCE BUT NOW A ONE IN FOUR
CHANCE AT A MILLION.
 I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR
ERIK.
 HE WAS STARVING.
AND YET HE HAD THOSE
REWARDS.
SO IT JUST STILL WASN'T
ENOUGH.
 EVEN ON EVERY REWARD, TOO,
EVERY SINGLE ONE.
 I KNOW.
 I'M JUST AS STARVING.
I'M SO HUNGRY.
 WE ALL GET BACK TO CAMP
KIND OF EXCHANGE A FEW SAD
PLEASANTRIES ABOUT THE STATE
OF AFFAIRS.
AND I'M ALREADY THINKING
ABOUT THE GAME.
A LITTLE BIT MORE PUMPED
THAN EVER THAT NOW I'M IN
THE FINAL FOUR.
AND MY FIRST THOUGHT IS I
HAVE TO BE THE FIRST PERSON
TO GET TO EDDIE.
EDDIE IS SOMEBODY THAT I
HAVEN'T REALLY BONDED WITH
THAT CLOSELY BUT I NEED TO
GET INTO HIS GOOD GRACES.
SINCE HE'S PROBABLY THE GUY
MOST LIKELY TO WIN THE NEXT
COMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND
THEREFORE TO BE IN A
POSITION OF POWER TO
DETERMINE WHO GOES TO THE
FINAL THREE.
 WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT,
MAN?
 ABOUT PLEADING OUR CASE.
 WHAT ARE YOU?
 I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I THINK YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU
CAN PROBABLY BRING SHERRI.
 YOU WANT TO TRY TO RUN
WITH THAT, WITH SHERRI?
 YEAH.
 GOING TO THE END NOW,
IT'S TWO FANS, TWO
FAVORITES.
THE WAY I'M GOING TO TRY TO
MAKE IT GO IS WE VOTE OUT
DAWN NEXT.
SHERRI COMES IN THIRD,
COCHRAN COMES IN SECOND AND
I COME IN FIRST AND I WIN
THE MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE.
 OUR TREE MAIL IS HERE.
 OPEN IT UP.
 LITTLE BOX.
 OKAY.
 IS THIS GAME STRESSING
YOU OUT, CAUSING TOULOUSE
SLEEP.
TO GAIN AN EXTRA COMPETITIVE
EDGE YOU HAVE TO DIG DEEP.
 YES, YES, YES!
 YES!
 OH, YES.
 I'M SO GLAD.
 SO AWESOME.
THANK GOD.
 AWESOME.
 RIGHT NOW MOST EVERYONE'S
HEADS ARE STILL KIND OF
SWIRLING.
EVERYONE IS STILL A LITTLE
UNSETTLED THIS MORNING.
AND I WANTED TO APPRECIATE
THAT I GOT MYSELF TO HERE.
AND IT'S ALMOST THE END.
IT'S DAY 37.
I'LL BE SO RELIEVED TO HAVE
MY BRAIN BACK.
 BECAUSE YOU'VE LOST PART
OF IT OUT HERE.
 IT'S A BIG DEAL
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE
ME WHOSE'S PLAYED BEFORE AND
REALLY MADE ZERO STRATEGIC
MOVES.
 I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
AND THOUGHT YOU MADE ALL
THESE DECISIONS AND YOU GOT
YOURSELF TO FINAL FOUR.
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW
IS PLAY YOUR GUTS OUT AT THE
CHALLENGES.
 IT'S ALMOST YOU CAN DO TO
KEEP IT TOGETHER.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO
YOUR REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, WITH ONE HAND YOU
WILL STEADY A BALANCING
BOARD WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
BUILDING A HOUSE OF CARDS
WITH THE OTHER HAND.
THE FIRST PERSON TO BUILD
THEIR HOUSE OF CARDS HIGH
ENOUGH TO REACH THE FINISH
MARK WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
PLAYING FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: YOU SURVIVED 37
DAYS.
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINAL
FOUR.
IN ORDER TO HAVE A SHOT AT
WINNING HAD THIS GAME YOU
HAVE TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL
THREE.
WINNER OF TODAY'S CHALLENGE
WILL HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE
IN YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
SO YOU WIN THIS CHALLENGE,
YOU GET THIS ADVANTAGE, YOU
WIN TOMORROW'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, YOU ARE IN THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO
BE JUST A REGULAR REWARD
CHALLENGE, SOMETHING GREAT
TO EAT.
BUT IT IS AN ADVANTAGE IN
THE TIME FOUR.
THAT'S HUGE IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: THIS CHALLENGE
RIGHT HERE COULD BE YOUR
MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
YOUR FINAL REWARD CHALLENGE.
WIN THIS, YOU HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE IN YOUR FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
SURVIVORS, READY.
GO.
 BIG LEARNING CURVE OUT OF
THE GATE.
WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH TO
BUILD A SOLID FOUNDATION
THAT CAN WITHSTAND A HOUSE
OF CARDS HIGH ENOUGH TO
REACH THAT RED LINE.
SHERRI OFF TO A QUICK START.
COCHRAN RIGHT BEHIND.
DAWN GETTING SOMETHING
GOING.
EDDIE BRINGING UP THE REAR.
BUT LOTS OF THINGS CAN
HAPPEN IN THIS CHALLENGE.
THE HIGHER IT GETS, THE MORE
PRECARIOUS IT GETS.
DO NOT PANIC IF YOU FEEL
YOU'RE BEHIND.
CHANCES ARE, THAT PERSON IN
THE LEAD WILL RUN INTO
TROUBLE.
AND THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IT
CAN TUMBLE.
COCHRAN WITH ONE SLIGHT MOVE
AND HIS WHOLE STACK CAME
DOWN OPENING THE DOOR NOW
FOR DAWN WHOSE'S IN THE
LEAD.
WITH SHERRI RIGHT BEHIND.
AND IT HAPPENED TO SHERRI.
SHERRI IS NOW STARTING OVER.
IT IS ALL DAWN AND EDDIE
RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS HOW THIS CHALLENGE
GOES.
JUST KEEP WORKING ON YOURS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYBODY
ELSE.
EDDIE HAS BEEN VERY SLOW BUT
VERY STEADY.
IT'S PAYING OFF.
IT'S RIGHT BEHIND DAWN.
COCHRAN BARELY MAKES A MOVE
AND DROPS HIS STACK.
DAWN IS DOING A NICE JOB.
DAWN GETTING VERY CLOSE TO
THE TOP.
COCHRAN TRYING TO REBUILD.
SHERRI TRYING TO REBUILD.
EDDIE STARTING TO GAIN ON
DAWN.
DAWN'S VERY, VERY CLOSE.
GOING TO TAKE A VERY LIGHT
TOUCH.
WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE BUT NO,
DAWN LOSES HER ENTIRE STACK.
SHE WAS ONE CARD AWAY FROM
THE TOP.
NOW IT'S EDDIE IN THE LEAD
WITH COCHRAN TRYING TO
REBUILD.
SHERRI IS STARTING TO GAIN
ON EDDIE.
EDDIE NOW STARTING OVER.
SHERRI NOW IN THE LEAD.
THIS IS WHY YOU CANNOT PANIC
OR GET FRUSTRATED.
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.
COCHRAN DROPS HIS STACK
AGAIN.
IT'S DAWN AND EDDIE TRYING
TO CATCH SHERRI.
SHERRI HAS NOT WON AN
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE YET.
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT ONE TO
WIN.
GIVING YOU AN ADVANCE IN THE
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE
THAT SENDS YOU TO THE END.
SHERRI LOSES HALF OF HER
STACK.
OPENING THE DOOR FOR DAWN
NOW WHOSE'S NOW BACK IN THE
LEAD.
AND DAWN LOSES HER STACK.
EDDIE NOW IN THE LEAD WITH
COCHRAN TRYING TO CATCH
EDDIE.
BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND
FORTH IT IS EDDIE, RIGHT
BEHIND HIM IS SHERRI.
AND COMING UP IS COCHRAN.
EDDIE GETTING CLOSER.
HE ONLY HAS FOUR CARDS LEFT.
WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO REACH
THE TOP?
EDDIE LOSES HALF HIS STACK,
OPENING THE DOOR FOR SHERRI
AGAIN.
RIGHT NOW IT IS SHERRI AND
COCHRAN.
SHERRI WITH A BIT OF A LEAD.
COCHRAN RIGHT BEHIND.
EDDIE TRYING TO STAY IN IT.
DAWN'S STARTING OVER.
SHERRI GETTING CLOSER.
CAN SHE KEEP IT STEADY?
THIS IS THE CLOSEST SHE'S
BEEN.
COCHRAN NOW RIGHT THERE.
IT IS COCHRAN AND SHERRI,
VERY CLOSE.
WE ARE DEAD EVEN.
RIGHT NOW BOTH ARE AT THE
SAME SPOT.
BOTH PLACING ANOTHER CARD.
SHERRI WITH ANOTHER CARD.
COCHRAN WITH ANOTHER CARD.
SHERRI HANGING ON, BARELY.
SHERRI LOSES HER ENTIRE
STACK.
OPENING THE DOOR FOR
COCHRAN.
ES HAS ONE CARD AWAY.
IT WOULD BE HIS THIRD
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE WIN.
COCHRAN WINS ADVANTAGE IN
THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE!
 AWESOME.
GOOD JOB.
 Jeff: COCHRAN, COME ON
OVER.
 GOOD JOB, COCHRAN.
 Jeff: YOUR THIRD
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE WIN.
THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR
TOMORROW'S FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
THIS COULD BE A MILLION
DOLLAR REWARD RIGHT HERE.
KEEP IT SEALED UNTIL THE
CHALLENGE.
CONGRATS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW FOR
YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
 COCHRAN WON IS SO I'M
TRYING TO KEEP PERSPECTIVE.
BUT I KEEP THINKING YOU'RE
NOT GUARANTEED ANYTHING.
SO REALLY WHAT'S IT WILL
COME DOWN TO IS WHO WINS
IMMUNITY.
IF YOU DON'T WIN IMMUNITY
YOURSELF, YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
 YEAH TO GO, COCHRAN.
 YOU EARNED THAT.
 MY GREAT CHALLENGE STREAK
WHICH WAS TEMPORARILY ON
HOLD HAS COME ROARING BACK.
I STACKED A HOUSE OF CARDS
BETTER THAN ANY OF MY
OPPONENTS AND WON NOT ONLY
THE THRILL OF BEING ANOTHER
VICTOR IN ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
BUT AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
UPCOMING FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
SO I AM THE CHALLENGE BEAST.
 THAT WAS AWESOME.
GOOD JOB.
 THIRD IMMUNITY-- I MEAN
THIRD WIN.
 YEAH.
 THIS COULD BE A MILLION
DOLLAR ADVANTAGE.
SO WING THE ADVANTAGE WAS
HUGE.
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT
POTENTIALLY COULD HELP ME
BUT BECAUSE I KEPT IT OUT OF
THE HANDS OF SOME PEOPLE I
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAVE IT.
I WAS SCARED THAT EDDIE
MIGHT GET THE ADVANTAGE.
I WOULDN'T WANT DAWN TO HAVE
IT IN CASE I DECIDED I
WANTED HER TO HAVE IT
INSTEAD IS SO IT IS IN THE
RIGHT HANDS, AND CAPABLE
HANDS.
AND I'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
STANDING BESIDE YOU THAN
DAWN.
 NO, WE HAVE TO.
 I KNOW.
 IF IT'S THE FINAL THREE I
WOULD WANT TO SIT NEXT TO
COCHRAN AND EDDIE-- EDDIE.
DAWN HAS PLAYED THE SYMPATHY
CARD IN THIS GAME LIKE NO
OTHER.
THE WHOLE MOTHER AND SIX
CHILDREN AND ADOPTION AND
CRYING.
AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT
WOULD HELP DAWN WIN THE GAME.
 DAWN IS GOING TO WIN, I
THINK SHE IS NUMBER ONE TO
WIN ALL THE JURY VOTES.
 UH-HUH.
 HELLO.
YEAH.
I'M NOT SITTING NEXT TO
THAT.
SHE'S TOO POWERFUL.
HUH-UH.
 NOTHING NEW, HUH?
 I'M LOCKED.
 I AM 100% LOCKED TO
YOUMENT I WON'T LIE THOUGH,
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT HOW IT IS
GOING TO END.
 I MEAN SHERRI IS IN.
 HOW COME SHE-- EVERYBODY
KNOWS --
 MAYBE SHE'S TRYING TO --
 I THINK FOR TODAY I JUST
DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE
THERE IS SO MUCH BREAKING
AWAY TO ADD AND
SIGHT-- ANXIETY.
 EVERY DAY I GET TO SEE A
NEW FREAKOUT FROM DAWN.
THERE IS THE OVER THE TOP
WEEPING, SONING, FLAILING OF
ARMS, ACTUALLY BEING LEFT
ALONE.
FORTUNATELY TODAY DAWN WAS
LEANING MORE TOWARDS THE
CATATONIC BREAKDOWN.
AND A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO
WITH THE SUDDEN INFLUX OF
PARANOIA THAT SHE'S HAVING
THAT WHAT IF EDDIE AND
SHERRI TAKE HER OUT.
 IF YOU ARE'S WORRIED THAT
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU
RIGHT NOW, THAN --
 YEAH.
 THE LONGER THAT I'M OUT
HERE THE HARDER IT'S BEEN
FOR ME JUST MENTALLY TO STAY
POSITIVE.
AND TO NOT SHALL PARANOID.
I MEAN EVERY DAY FOR ME
THERE'S SOME MOMENT WHERE I
AM EXHAUSTED AND I'M
LIKE-- I'M LIKE A BABY
STOMPING MY FEET.
 IT'S THE SAME WAY FOR YOU,
RIGHT.
 THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO
SCENARIO, NONE.
I MEAN YOU FEEL LIKE THAT
PLEASE DON'T START
DOUBTING --
 NO, IT'S JUST LIKE HOW I
ALWAYS SAY WE'RE A LOCK,
WE'RE A LOCK.
 ABSOLUTELY, TO THE VERY
END.
I WAS ACTUALLY WHEN WE WERE
COMING OVER HERE, I WAS LIKE
I WISH COCHRAN WOULD JUST
SPEND 20 MINUTES AND
REASSURE ME BECAUSE I
FEEL --
 THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING
NOW.
 BECAUSE I FEEL VULNERABLE,
YOU KNOW.
 DAWN FEELS LIKE SHE
AUTOMATICALLY DESERVES A
FAST PASS TO THE FINALS.
WHY, EXACTLY?
I DON'T KNOW.
EVERY DAY IS A ROLLER
COASTER WITH HER.
AND IT'S NOT FUN.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
ON DAY 37 SHE SHOULD BE
PARANOID BECAUSE I AM
CONSIDERING DITCHING HER.
 ALL RIGHT.
 OH MY GOD.
 ONE LAST CHANCE TO
CONTROL YOUR DESTINY.
YOU'LL WAIT FOR SOME MEN IN
A BOAT.
YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE AND
THEN TONIGHT YOUR VERY LAST.
 YOU'LL WAIT FOR SOME MEN
IN A BOAT.
LOVE IT.
WAY TO GO, GUYS.
 WE RECEIVED TREE MAIL
TODAY LETTING US KNOW TODAY
IS THE DAY OF OUR FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT
IS THE FAMOUS SURVIVORRIGHTS
OF PASSAGE.
SOMETHINGIVE'S BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO, HOPING I WOULD
GET TO SEE THIS MOMENT IN
THE GAME.
IT'S KIND OF A NOSTALGIC
MOMENT WHERE YOU GET TO
REFLECT ON THE PAST 38 DAYS
AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY
AHEAD OF US.
 SHE KIND OF MADE SURVIVOR
HISTORY FOR MAYBE NOT THE
BEST REASONS BUT SHE WASN'T
VOTED OFF FIRST THIS TIME
BECAUSE SHE WAS A BAD PLAYER,
SHE WAS VOTED OFF BECAUSE
SHE WAS A HUGE THREAT.
 YEAH, THAT WAS NOT A
WOMAN I WANTED TO GO
AGAINST.
 MY SURVIVOR EXPERIENCE
THE SECOND TIME AROUND WAS
DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTING.
I FEEL A LITTLE HONORED THAT
MY FELLOW TRIBE MATES
THOUGHT THAT I WAS SUCH A
THREAT THAT THEY HAD TO TAKE
ME OUT FIRST TO WICHBLT I
WAS THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL OF
ALL OF THEM AT THIS GAME.
I DEFINITELY SAW THE HUMOR
OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE IT
IS PRETTY FUNNY.
I GUESS SI HAVE A LOT OF
POTENTIAL AT SURVIVOR, WHICH
IS GOING TO REMAIN
UNREALIZED.
 ALLIE, WHO EXACTLY WAS
ALLIE, WHICH OF THREE BLONDS
WAS SHE.
 I ALWAYS CAME INTO THIS
THINKING, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE
MONEY, I'LL DO ANYTHING I
CAN FOR THE MONEY.
AND YOU REALLY LEARN QUICKLY
THAT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE
MONEY.
I WOULD SAY MY BEST MOMENT
WOULD JUST BE MEETING HOPE,
EDDIE AND REYNOLDS.
I WOULD SAY IT PROBABLY COST
ME THE GAME BEING FRIENDS
WITH THEM BUT I FEEL LIKE I
WILL BE FRIENDS WITH THEM
FOR LIFE.
 HOPE.
 EDDIE'S FIRST SWEETHEART.
 MY FIRST SURVIVOR LOVE.
MY FIRST LOVE EVER.
 OH MAN.
 MY SURVIVOR EXPERIENCE
WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE,
ONCE IN A LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY I'VE EVER HAD.
AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IN A
HEARTBEAT, WITHOUT EDDIE.
 SHAMAR, MY BROTHER FROM
ANOTHER MOTHER.
 HE JUST REALLY, HE WAS
MISUNDERSTOOD IN THIS GAME.
 SURVIVOR SAY TOUGH GAME.
I'M A STRONG GUY AND IT
TAKES A LOT TO BRING ME
DOWN.
BEING MEDICALLY PULLED FROM
THE GAME T WAS LIKE MAN THIS
IS HARD-CORE.
I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT THAT
MUCH PAIN.
 LAURA.
 WHAT WOULD I WANT RIGHT
NOW IF I COULD HAVE
ANYTHING.
IT'S NOT THE FOOD, IT'S NOT
THE WATER, IT'S REALLY THE
PEOPLE BACK HOME THAT YOU
LOVE.
I DEFINITELY THINK THAT I
CAME OUT OF THIS GAME
APPRECIATING THOSE PEOPLE A
LOT MORE.
 BRANDON.
 OH, BRANDON IS A
CHALLENGE BEAST.
I THINK THERE WAS A POINT IN
ITS GAME WHERE HIS PERSONAL
LIFE GOT TOO DIFFICULT TO
MANAGE WITH THE GAME.
 I WAS GIVING IT
EVERYTHING I GOT.
I PLAYED FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS OUT THERE AND WHEN I
KNEW I COULDN'T HAVE IT, I
JUST WANTED TO STARVE SOME
FOLKS.
I MADE IT RAIN WITH THEM.
I DON'T REGRET NONE OF IT
BECAUSE I PROVED MY POINT.
I MADE MY STATEMENT.
I WAS THE AUTHOR OF MY
ELIMINATION.
 MATT, MATT, MATT.
 SURVIVOR IS ONE OF THE
HARDEST GAMES THAT YOU COULD
EVER PLAY.
IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE
HARDEST THINGS THAT I'VE
EVER DONE.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A WAY
STRONGER MAN BECAUSE OF THIS
EXPERIENCE.
 JULIA.
 ONE OF THE BIGGEST
LESSONS I'VE LEARNED IS FOR
ME GOING FORWARD TRYING TO
MAKE IT AS A RACE CAR
DRIVER.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH
MORE RUTHLESS AND A GRELSIVE
IN GETTING WHAT I WANT.
 COREVEN.
 REALLY STRATEGIC,
SUPERCHARISMATIC, SO MUCH
ENERGY.
 I WAS GOING TO FLIP FOR A
GAY ANDTHROUGH HOTTIES THAT
IS CORRINE HANDBOOK 101, IN
THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO TAKE
RISKS AND SOMETIMES THEY
DON'T PAN OUT.
THE THING I'M MOST PROUD OF
IS I'M EXACTLY WHO I THINK I
AM, MAYBE EVEN WORSE.
 OH, MICHAEL.
 COMING OUT HERE AS A FAN,
I WANTED TO DO IT ALL.
I DID PLAY HARD.
I DID ALL OF THE THINGS THAT
I WANTED TO DO.
I'M PROUD OF MY GAME.
YOU KNOW, DREAMS DO COME
TRUE.
 PHILLIP, THE SPECIALIST,
THE CREATOR OF STEALTH "R"
US.
HE WAS A POWERHOUSE.
I MEAN HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC
GUY BUT DE KNOW THIS GAME.
PLAYING WITH BOSTON ROCK DID
SHOW HIM SOME RULES.
I'M GRAD TO HAVE PLAYED WITH
HIM AND BEEN UNDER HIS
TUTELAGE.
 HAPPY TO HAVE PLAYED WITH
HIM.
 IT WAS VERY SURREAL.
 IN THE PINK UNDERWEAR.
 COMING INTO THIS, I
WANTED TO PUT TOGETHER A
STRATEGY, STILL
INCORPORATING SOME OF THE
PRINCIPLESES OF STEALTH "R"
US TO PUT ON FULL DISPLAY MY
ABILITY TO GRASP AND LEARN
SOMETHING FROM A TRUE MASTER
OF THE GAME, BOSTON ROB.
AND I'M HOPING THAT MY
LEGACY IS NO, HE'S NOT THE
CRAZY GUY, PHILLIP IS TRULY
AN INTERESTING PERSON.
 MALCOLM, CHALLENGE BEAST.
I REALLY BELIEVE HE WAS THE
BIGGEST THREAT TO WIN THE
GAME.
 DOING TWO SEASONS
BACK-TO-BACK WAS INTENSE TO
SAY THE LEAST.
THE SECOND TIME I SWUNG FOR
THE FENCES, YEAH I CRASHED
AND BURNED ON THE WAY BUT
HAVING DONE IT TWICE AND NOT
WON.
THERE IS STILL A PART OF ME
THAT NEEDS TO BE BACK OUT
HERE TO GET THE JOB DONE.
 OH, REYNOLD, REYNOLD,
REYNOLD, MY BEST FRIEND IN
THE WHOLE GAME.
 I'M THRILLED TO HAVE MET
HIM AND WORKED WITH HIM OUT
HERE.
 AS A FAN PLAYING AGAINST
FAVORITES I THINK I WAS A
LITTLE BIT IN OVER MY HEAD
THERE ARE SOME CLEVER,
CUNNING PEOPLE OUT THERE AND
YOU ALWAYS NEED TO KEEP YOUR
GUARD UP.
I WAS JUST NEVER ABLE TO GET
THERE.
 ANDREA IS CHARMING,
BEAUTIFUL, I THINK MOST
IMPORTANTLY REALLY, REALLY
SMART.
 THE TIME I WANTED TO COME
IN PLAYING MORE AGGRESSIVE
AND I DID.
SO GOING HOME WITH AN IDOL
IN MY POCKET WAS DEFINITELY
THE LOW POINT OF MY GAME.
IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING TO
THINK THAT YOU COULD HAVE
MADE IT TO THE END.
 BRENDA.
 I THINK ONE OF THE
STRONGEST PLAYERS PHYSICALLY,
SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY AND
PSYCHOLOGICALLY TOO.
 MY SURVIVOR EXPERIENCE
REALLY CONNECTED ME TO BEING
A BETTER PERSON, BEING
GRATEFUL FOR MY FAMILY.
I FEEL LIKE THE GAME ISN'T
THAT BLACK AND WHITE.
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE REAL,
STRONG CONNECTIONS OUT HERE
AND BE MOTIVATED TO KEEP
THOSE CONNECTIONS.
I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT I
DID.
AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE A
THING.
 ERIK, I KNOW HE'S EXCITED
TO START THE NEXT CHAPTER IN
HIS LIFE BUT I'LL BE HONEST
AND TELL YOU I THINK HE WAS
GOING TO BE FINAL THREE.
LOVE YOU, ERIK.
 TOUGH BREAK.
 THIS TIME ON SURVIVOR AS
A FAVORITE IS MORE
DIFFICULT.
I WAS SICK TO MY STOMACH THE
WHOLE GAME BUT I MADE IT
INTO FIFTH PLACE WHICH IS
WHERE I MADE IT LAST TIME.
AND THEN THIS HORRIBLE
MEDICAL THING COMES AROUND.
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST FATE.
 THE RITES OF PASSAGE.
GOD THIS IS LIKE A DREAM
COME TRUE.
YOU KNOW ARE YOU AT THE END
WHEN YOU ARE SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO ALL THE TRIBE MEMBERS.
IT'S AWESOME.
 JUDGING BY THE LAST
ADVANTAGE COCHRAN IS GOING
TO BE TWO-STEPS AHEAD OF
EVERYBODY GOING INTO THE
LAST CHALLENGE.
 I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS
ABOUT THAT.
BUT IF IT'S PHYSICAL, YOU
CAN GUARANTEE I WILL KNOCK
ANYBODY OUT OF MY WAY TO WIN
THIS CHALLENGE TONIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON
ANYTHING.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
THIS IS YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
READY TO GET TO IT?
 YES.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: GIVE IT UP, DAWN,
ARE YOU SAFE NO MORE.
 OKAY.
COCHRAN HAS THE ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE HE WON THE REWARD
CHALLENGE YESTERDAY.
SO IF HE WINS IMMUNITY I
HOPE COCHRAN REMEMBERS THAT
WE'RE STILL TRUSTING EACH
OTHER AND SAYING LET'S STAY
LOCKED AND GET US CLOSE TO
THE END.
 Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME,
I PLUNITY IS-- IMMUNITY IS
UP FOR GRABS.
TODAY'S CHALLENGE WILL TAKE
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEFT IN
YOUR TANK BOTH PHYSICALLY
AND MENTALLY.
ON MY GO YOU WILL RACE UP A
THREE STORY TO WE UNTIE A
BAG OF PUZZLE PIECES, LAUNCH
YOURSELF DOWN A SLIDE, DROP
YOUR BAG, HEAD UP TO GET
YOUR NEXT BAG.
ONCE YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL
THREE BAGS, WILL YOU USE THE
PIECES TO BUILD A PUZZLE.
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINCE
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEES
THEMSELVES A SPOT AT THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO
PLEAD YOUR CASE TO THE JURY
ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE THE
MILLION DOLLARS AND THE
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
LOSERS AFTER 38 DAYS
SOMEBODY'S SURVIVOR
ADVENTURE WILL COME ONE DAY
SHORT.
COCHRAN, AT THE LAST
CHALLENGE YOU WON A REWARD
IN THIS CHALLENGE.
OPEN THE NOTE, READ IT.
 YOUR ADVANTAGE IN TODAY'S
CHALLENGE IS YOU WILL NOT
HAVE TO UNTIE YOUR BAGS OF
PUZZLE PIECES SAVING YOU A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME.
 Jeff: SO LET ME EXPLAIN.
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO RAIPS.
WHEN YOU GET TO YOUR BAG IT
WILL BE WAITING THERE FOR
YOU, YOU CAN HEAD BACK DOWN.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO
HAVE TO STOP AND GO THROUGH
A SERIES OF KNOTS.
SHOULD GIVE YOU A PRETTY
DECENT ADVANTAGE IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO DRAW
FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET TO IT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, AND A
GUARANTEED SPOT AT THE FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL, HUGE STAKE.
SURVIVORS READY.
GO!
COCHRANS EFFORTS AT THE LAST
CHALLENGE GIVES HIM A HUGE
ADVANTAGE IN THIS ONE AND

COCHRAN HAD A HUGE LEAD BUT

MILLION DOLLARS AND IT
STARTS RIGHT HERE.
COCHRAN WITH HIS SECOND

COCHRAN STARTING TO FIGURE

 COCHRAN WITH HIS FIFTH.
 THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP.
SHERRI WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
SHE'S GETTING IN ON THIS

COCHRAN ADDS ANOTHER PIECE,
STARTING TO PULL AHEAD NOW.
COCHRAN MAYBE THE LEAST
LIKELY PERSON TO DOMINATE
THE CHALLENGES TO BE HIS
FOURTH INDIVIDUAL WIN IF HE

NOTHING MORE SHE WOULD LIKE
THAN TO PUT IT RIGHT BACK ON

 Jeff: COCHRAN, COME ON
OVER.
 YOU SO EARNED THAT.
IT'S CRAZY.
 Jeff: COCHRAN WITH HIS
THIRD INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
WIN, FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGE WIN.
ARE YOU IN A VERY ELITE
GROUP RIGHT NOW.
 I TOLD YOU I SHOULD BE
AMONG THE MARIANAS, NOW MI
DOING IT, RIGHT.
 Jeff: THIS GOES BACK TO
DAY ONE, THE FIRST TIME YOU
PLAYED WHEN YOU FIRST SAID
PLEASE CALL MY COCHRAN.
 I THOUGHT HI PROVEN LAST
TIME BUT I WASN'T AWARE OF
WHAT I COULD-- .
 Jeff: YOU ARE GUARANTEED
A SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNSELITY.
WILL YOU GET A CHANCE TO
PLEAD YOUR CASE FOR A
MILLION DOLLARS AND WHY YOU
DESERVE THE TITLE OF SEOUL
SURVIVOR.
CONGRATS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: AS FOR THE REST OF
YOU, DAWN, SHERRI, EDDIE,
TONIGHT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO
COME ONE DAY SHORT OF
REACHES THEIR GOAL.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 THANK YOU.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
 IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE ANY
BETTER.
AND I'M ACTUALLY IN A
POSITION OF POWER.
I MEAN SHERRI WANTS TO WORK
WITH ME, EDDIE WANTS TO WORK
WITH ME, AND DAWN WANTS TO
WORK WITH ME.
AND I HAVE MY PICK OF THE
LITTER.
SO THERE IS A DILL BE MY
SHOULDER SAYING MAN, I THINK
I'M GOING TO GET RID OF
DAWN.
 COCHRAN THAT WAS
INCREDIBLE.
THAT PUZZLE WAS HARD.
 YEAH.
I DIDN'T-- I'M STILL A
LITTLE BIT IN DISBELIEF.
 I, COCHRAN, HAVE WON FOUR
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES.
SO RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING
OKAY, I GOT THE MILLION.
THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS WHO
DESERVES $1 LUNN,000 IN
SECOND PLACE.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S FULLY
SET IN YET.
I MEAN THIS IS 13 YEARS.
 I KNOW, BELIEVE ME, I
KNOW.
 IT'S TO THE GOING TO BE
SHERRI.
SHERRI MIGHT BE ABLE TO
SQUEAK OUT ONE VOTE BUT
SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET
ENOUGH TO GET SECOND PLACE.
SO NOW IT IS ABOUT TO I WANT
TO BRING DAWN AND CONSTANT
EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS OR EDDIE
A CHAUVINISTIC 23-YEAR-OLD
IDIOT.
 IT WAS JUST LIKE AN EPIC
SURVIVOR DAY.
 THE BALANCE FOR SECOND
PLACE IS HEATED.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
IT'S SO LONELY AT THE TOP.
IT'S HORRIBLE FOR ME TO SAY.
 CRAZY, COCHRAN.
 THAT WAS SO-- I MEAN IT
REALLY IS EMOTIONAL.
 IT'S JUST SO MUCH.
I MEAN SO MUCH COMPARED TO
LAST SEASON.
IT'S SO DIFFERENT.
IT'S LIKE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW.
 I MEAN WHAT DO WE
DO-- WHAT IS YOUR PLAN YOUR
LAST NIGHT.
 I DO FULLY TRUST COCHRAN.
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M MY OWN
WORST ENEMY.
THAT I'M LIKE BEATING MYSELF
UP IF I DON'T MAKE THE NEXT
STEP.
THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I DESERVE
TO DO GOOD.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN.
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL
BE YOU OR DAWN FOR TONIGHT.
 ONLY ONE OF US CAN GO.
 I KNOW.
 I THINK IT WILL
DEFINITELY BE ME MORE THAN
DAWN.
DAWN IS GOING PLAY THE
MOTHER CARD, AND START
CRYING AND PEOPLE WILL --
 DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL
BUY THE MOTHER CARD.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I KNEW IT WOULD BE ME OR
DAWN TODAY.
 I REALLY DO THINK I HAVE
THE BEST CHANCE TO WIN THIS
TO GET IN THE FINAL THREE SO
I AM TRYING TO CONVINCE
COCHRAN ON A LOGICAL LEVEL,
NOT EMOTIONAL OR BULLYING
SENSE INTO BRING ME INTO THE
FINAL THREE.
 THE JURY LOVES EVERYTHING
YOU SAY.
 IT'S BECAUSE I'M AN
IDIOT.
WHAT I DO TALK ABOUT.
I DON'T TALK ABOUT STRATEGY.
I HAVEN'T PISSED ANYBODY OFF
BUT ON THE OPPOSITE IS I
ONLY VOTED ONE PERSON OFF SO
HOW STRATEGIC HAVE I BEEN.
 I'M TRYING TO REASON WITH
COCHRAN TO GET HIM TO TAKE
ME FISMT DO WIN THE MILLION
DOLLAR PRIZE I WANT TO OPEN
LIKE A DOG KIND OF LIKE
SHELTER, KENNEL, PLAY PEN
AREA, LIKE ATTACHED TO A
BAR.
SO LIKE THOSE ARE MY TWO
FAVORITE THINGS.
I LIKE DOGS AND I LIKE BARS
P IF I COULD OPEN A BAR AND
YOU BRING YOUR DOG THERE IT
WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE.
 I-- PLAYED SUCH A GOOD
GAME.
 IT IS A TOUGH DECISION.
 THAT'S THE END OF THE
GAME FOR YOU.
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS
LESS OF A THREAT IN TERMS OF
ME BRINGING THE MILLION
DOLLARS AND TITLE.
I KNOW SCHERR LI GO TO THE
END, AND I CAN BEAT HER.
THE BIGGEST QUESTION MARK IS
REQUEST I BEAT EDDIE OR CAN
I BEAT DAWN.
THEY'RE BOTH PEOPLE THAT
BRING A LOT OF PROS AND CONS
TO THE TABLE.
 I HOPE I DON'T TALK
MYSELF OUT OF THE DECISION.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MIKE, PHILLIP, MALCOLM,
REYNOLD, ANDREA, BRENDA AND
ERIK WHO WAS PULLED FROM THE
GAME FOR MEDICAL REASONS BUT
RETURNS AS A MEMBER OF THE
JURY.
SO A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
MOMENTS AFTER TRIBAL ENDED
COCHRAN, WHAT HAPPENED?
 LIT REALLYLY WITHIN
MINUTES AFTER LEAVING TRIBAL
COUNCIL ERIK STARTED WALKING
UNSTEADILY AND THE NEXT
THING I KNEW HE WAS KIND OF
PASSED OUT ON THIS ROCK.
AND IT WAS A SCARY REMINDER
OF EVEN HOW LATE IN THE GAME
SOMETHING DEVASTATING CAN
HAPPEN.
I THINK WE WERE ALL IN
SHOCK.
 Jeff: EDDIE, DID IT OPEN
A DOOR FOR YOU IN A WAY
BECAUSE ERIK IS A COMPETITOR
AND HE'S GONE AND LOOKING AT
THESE THREE, MAYBE I GOT A
SHOT.
 IT DEFINITELY STARTED
THINGS UP A BITMENT BECAUSE
I THINK WAS ERIK, DAWN AND
SHERRI WHO WERE THE PLANNED
FINAL THREE.
SO I DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF ROOM TO CAUSE COMENTION.
 Jeff: COCHRAN, I DIDN'T
HEAR YOUR NAME IN THAT FINAL
THREE.
 YEAH, IT IS ALARMING.
IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING
THAT ERIK WASN'T THERE
BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMEBODY
KEEPING ME OUT OF THE
POTENTIAL FINAL THREE.
IT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT HE WENT THAT MADE IT
HARD TO CELEBRATE.
 Jeff: TALK ABOUT THE TWO
CHALLENGES THAT HAPPENED.
FIRST THE REWARD IS AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
COCHRAN WINS.
HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGE.
HE CAN'T EVEN RESIST.
YOU JUST FEEL SO GOOD,
RIGHT.
 IT'S BIZARRE TO ME
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT
THE SURVIVOR, OUTWIT,
OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.
I SAID MAYBE I CAN SATISFY A
THIRD OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS.
OUTWIT, MAYBE.
I FEEL LIKE LAST TIME PEOPLE
THOUGHT I WAS WORTHLESS AND
I STARTED TO BELIEVE I WAS
WORTHLESS.
NOW I'M FEEL MORNING
CONFIDENT.
THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE TO
SUCCEED IN THAT WAS
REMARKABLE TO ME.
 Jeff: SO THAT BRINGS US
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
COCHRAN, WHAT IS THE FEELING
WHEN I YELL COCHRAN WINS
IMMUNITY.
 IT WAS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE MOMENT OF THIS
GAME FOR ME SO FAR.
IT WASN'T THE FACT
NECESSARILY THAT I WAS GOING
TO BE SAFE FOR TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IT WAS THE FACT THAT I
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CAME-- CAPABLE OF DOING THAT
A COUPLE YEAR AGO.
 Jeff: SO DAWN, ONE OF YOU
WILL BECOME THE 8th AND
FINAL MEMBER OF THE JURY.
COCHRAN CLEARLY HAS NOTHING
WORRY ABOUT AND HAS A LITTLE
BIT OF SWAY BECAUSE HE'S
SAFE.
WHAT CASE DO YOU MAKE TO HIM
TODAY.
BECAUSE THERE IS A MILLION
DOLLAR DECISION.
 WELL, I THINK I HAVE DONE
A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF
MALIGNING MYSELF WITH MOST
PEOPLE ON THE JURY AND EDDIE
HANDS DOWN IS SO LIKABLE.
HE HASN'T HAD TO SEND ANYONE
HOME ON THE JURY WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF PHILLIP.
THEY'RE GOING LOVE HIM.
 Jeff: EDDIE.
 YEAH-- IT'S YOUR GAME,
BROTHER.
 IF I WERE DAWN I BREW
PROBABLY BE SAYING THE SAME
THING.
ON THE FLIP SIDE NOT TO PUT
MY OWN SELF DOWN BUT I
REALLY DIDN'T ONLY VOTE OFF
ONE PERSON ON THE JURY.
SO STRATEGY WISE HOW MUCH I
DID REALLY, REALLY DO OUT
HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
IT IS A GAME OF DECEPTION,
NOT NECESSARILY A GAME OF
LOYALTY AND HONESTY.
DAWN MADE HUGE MOVES AND
MADE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE
ENTIRE WAY IT'S PLAYED.
SO I THINK GOING WITH DAWN
TO THE FINAL THREE IS ALMOST,
YOU KNOW, PUTTING HER RIGHT
IN FRONT.
 Jeff: SO COCHRAN, EDDIE
IS SAYING YOU COULD PROBABLY
BURY ME BY POINTING OUT ALL
THE THINGS I DIDN'T DO OTHER
THAN STAY BASICALLY HUMBLE
AND LIKABLE.
EDDIE AND DAWN BOTH HAVE
GREAT ARGUMENTS.
MEAN DAWN MAKE HERSELF SOUND
LIKE A COMPLETE VILLAIN, I
DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY
IS THE CASE.
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO
IS WHAT CRITERIA THE JURY IS
GOING TO BE USING.
MY PERCEPTION OF WHAT THE
JURY WANTS IN A WINNER,
THAT'S WHAT I AM PROBABLY
BASING MY VOTE ON.
 Jeff: SHERRI, WHAT'S IT
LIKE TO SIT ONE OF FOUR AND
NOBODY REALLY PAYING ANY
ATTENTION, IT'S ALMOST LIKE
IT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION
WILL YOU GO TO THE FINAL
THREE.
 THAT'S THE WAY THEY HAVE
PLAYED THE ENTIRE GAME BY
THINKING THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
A THREAT.
BUT I'M STILL HERE.
I HAVE MADE ALLIANCES.
I MADE CORE ALLIANCES AND
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO FORGET
THAT SHERRI JUST SITS HERE.
I MAY NOT SAY A LOT BUT I
TAKE IN A LOT.
 Jeff: COCHRAN THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FAIR WARNING, TAKE ME
WITH YOU, YOU SHOULD.
TOMORROW NIGHT YOU MAY SEE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
 I THINK THAT SHERRI
PROBABLY HAS DONE MORE TO
GET TO THIS POINT THAN IS
IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.
 COCHRAN, I THINK YOUR
BEST CHANCE IS BEATING ME
AND SHERRI, TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.
 OKAY.
 I LOVE BEING IN THAT,
GOING WITH YOU.
 Jeff: DAWN, PUT A LITTLE
BIT OF FEAR IN YOU?
 NOT MORE THAN I'VE HAD
YESTERDAY OR THE LAST 36
DAYS BEFORE THAT.
 Jeff: OKAY T IS TIME TO
VOTE.
EDDIE, YOU'RE UP.
 SORRY, DAWN.
 PLEASE GO HOME.
 I THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON OUT THERE THAT CAN
BEAT ME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, DAWN.
EDDIE.
EDDIE.
TWO VOTES EDDIE, ONE VOTE
DAWN.
178th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE 8th AND FINAL MEMBER OF
OUR JURY, EDDIE.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
EDDIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GREAT GAME, GUYS.
 Jeff: DAWN, COCHRAN,
SHERRI, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU
CAN GO IN THIS GAME.
TOMORROW NIGHT POWER SHIFTS
TO THE JURY, A GROUP OF
PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND
IN VOTING OUT NOW HOLD YOUR
FATE IN THEIR HANDS.
YOU HAVE ONE NIGHT LEFT OUT
HERE.
TAKE IT IN, TRY TO GET A
GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND WE'LL
SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW
NIGHT FOR YOUR FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I THINK SHERRI HAS A ZERO
PERCENT CHANCE OF WINNING
WHICH IS WHY SHE IS GOING TO
THE FINAL THREE.
I FEEL LIKE IF I WOULD HAVE
GOT TEN TO THE FINAL THREE,
FIRST PLACE WAS MINE FOR THE
TAKING.
AS MUCH TAS SUCKS, I'M
PRETTY HAPPY WITH HOW I
EARNEDDED UP.
THE FACT THAT IT IS FANS
VERSUS FAVORITE AND I MADE
TO FOUR REALLY SPEAKS LARGE
VOLUME TO HOW I PLAYED AND I
REALLY WISH I WAS GOING TO
BE THERE IN THE MORNING.
BUT I'M OUT TONIGHT.
AND THAT'S HOW IT WENT
TODAY.
 TELL ME YOUR DEFINITION
OF A PAWN.
 PAWNS ARE WORTHLESS,
BASICALLY.
ARE YOU WILLING TO THROW
THEM OUT THERE BECAUSE
THEY'LL GET TAKEN.
SO NO STRATEGIC INPUT.
NO REAL STRENGTH.
AND EXPENDABLE.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY
DEFINITION.
 OKAY.
 DO AGREE WITH THAT, DAWN?
 OH GOD, MY HUSBAND WILL
BE SO PROUD OF ME SITTING IN
THE FINAL THREE.
HE TOLD ME THIS GAME WAS
MADE FOR ME FOLLOW ME ALL
ALONG THAT HE BELIEVED IN ME
SO MUCH, THAT'S WHY I'M
SITTING HERE.
> MY GOD.
 I HAD A GOAL COMING INTO
THIS THAT I WASN'T GOING TO
TAKE NOTHING BELOW FINAL
THREE.
 OH, GOSH, YOU GUYS.
 THIS IS CAMPAIGN MILK,
EGGS, SAUSAGES,.
 BREAD.
 THERE'S BUTTER AND
SAUSAGE.
 MY SELLING POINT TO WHY I
DESERVE TO WIN, BECAUSE I
CAME IN AS A FAN.
I CAME IN AS AN UNDERDOGMENT
I DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A
SHELL TER.
HOW TO SURVIVE.
I DID ALL THAT I WAS
ADAPTABLE.
I WAS FLEXIBLE.
I GOT AN ALLIANCE.
I RAN THE ALLIANCE.
THAT'S WHY I'M STILL SITTING
HERE.
 TO DAY 39, THE THREE OF
US.
CONGRATULATIONS.
 CONGRATULATIONS AND TO A
GOOD TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 MY ALLIANCE WITH COCHRAN
IN THE GAME BUT MY ALLIANCE
WAS REALLY MY FAMILY AT
HOME.
THERE WAS NEVER A DAY I
WASN'T LOYAL TO MY FAMILY.
 BEST HAVE YOU EVER HAD.
 IN MY LIFE.
 I'M EXCITED TO HAVE MEAT,
EVEN TO SEE IT.
JUST TO HOLD IT.
 WHEN I LEAVE TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS, I'M CHANGED.
I ACCOMPLISHED A GOAL OF
GETTING TO THE END OF THIS
GAME, SOMETHING THAT WAS A
DREAM AND I'VE LEARNED SO
MUCH ABOUT MYSELF.
AND I LEARNED THAT I CAN
ACTUALLY PLAY THIS GAME
WELL.
AND I'M PROUD OF THAT.
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE MADE
THEE DECISIONS BUT ME THIS
TIME.
 WE BEAT ALL OF THEM.
THE LAST TWO RETURNING
PLAYERS.
 WE COULDN'T HAVE GOT THIS
FAR WITHOUT EACH OTHER SO
THAT'S THE INTERESTING
THING.
 WE CALLED EVERY SINGLE
SHOT.
WE REALLY DID.
 COCHRAN AND I HAVE PLAYED
SURVIVOR FOR 67 DAYS
TOGETHER.
THE FACT THAT IT'S COCHRAN
AND I TOGETHER AND COCHRAN
AND I AT THE END OF THIS IS
JUST-- I FEEL LIKE IT'S A
STORY BOOK ENDING.
BUT IT'S STILL GAME ON IN MY
MIND.
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT I CAN
BEAT SHERRI OR COCHRAN.
 THE FIRST TIME IN 39 DAYS
I REALLY FELT FRAZZLED IS
TODAY.
I HAVE WRITTEN A
PRIZE-WINNING PAPER, HARVARD
LAW SCHOOL ON HOW TO SURVIVE
A JURY SYSTEM THERE SE BIG
DIFFERENCE IN WRITING A
PAPER AND LIVING OUT THE
REALITY.
AND I'M GRAPPLING WITH THAT
DICHOTOMY RIGHT NOW.
LAW SCHOOL HASN'T PREPARED
ME FOR THIS YOU THINK IT
WOULD.
SORRY LAR VARD, YOU HAVEN'T
TAUGHT ME THAT MUCH ABOUT
HOW TOED ARES A JURY BUT I
WILL LEARN MY LESSON TONIGHT
I THINK.
WHEN EVERYTHING IS LOOK GOOD
FOR ME I SUDDENLY START
EXPECTING THE WORST AND
PREPARING MYSELF FOR THE
WORST.
AM I GO STOCK ABLE TO GET ON
TO SURVIVOR WHICH I HAVE
BEEN DREAMING OF DOING FOR
HALF MY LIFE.
I GUESS ON I GET TO RETURN
AS A FAVORITE, YOU KNOW, THE
END GAME SCENARIO IS NO
DIFFERENT.
I FEEL LIKE I PLAY A GREAT
GAME.
I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE END.
THIS IS MY GAME TO LOSE BUT
ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE DOUBTS
ARE PLAGUING MY MIND.
I'M JUST KIND OF THIS
AWKWARD GEEK WHO HASN'T
REALLY SDOON NISMING I KNOW
I HAVE DONE STUFF AND CAN
EXPRESS MYSELF BUT DOUBTS
SCREENS-- KREEB CREEPS IN,
OR SEEPS IF.
IT IS NOT HEALTHY ESPECIALLY
WHEN I NEED TO PLEADS MY
DAYS -- CASE AND FEEL
CONFIDENT IN THE GAME I
PLAYED.
BUT WHEN I'M NOT FEELING
CONFIDENT IN MYSELF IT'S
HARD TO DO.
 THANK YOU.
 DID IT.
 DONE AND DONE
.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
MICHAEL, PHILLIP, MALCOLM,
REYNOLD, ANDREA, BRENDA,
ERIC AND EDDIE VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WELL, DAWN, COCHRAN, SHERRI,
39 DAYS IT HAS BEEN A CRAZY
ONE IMPROMPTU TRIBAL COUNCIL,
LOTS OF IDOL PARANOIA AND
THE THREE OF YOU DID WHAT 17
OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T DO.
YOU MADE IT TO THE END.
TONIGHT YOU HAVE A SHOT TO
PLEAD YOUR CASE.
THE POWER SHIFTS TO THE
JURY.
THIS GROUP THAT YOU VOTED
OUT, THEY WILL DECIDE
TONIGHT WHO THEY THINK IS
MOST DESERVING OF THE TITLE
OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE
MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES
ALONG WITH IT.
HERE IS HOW IT IS GOING TO,
WOCHLT OPENING STATEMENTS
AND THE JURY WILL ADDRESS
YOU.
THEN WE WILL VOTE.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
DAWN, YOU'RE UP.
 FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT
TO SAY THAT I'M LOOKING AT
THE GROUP OF YOU.
AND FEELING A LITTLE BIT
HUMBLED BECAUSE I KNOW HOW
HARD EVERYONE PLAYED.
I THINK YOU GUYS ALL SAW HOW
HARD THIS GAME WAS FOR ME.
I THINK A LOT OF THE EMOTION
HAD TO DO WITH HOW HARD IT
WAS FOR ME TO BE DUPLICITOUS
BECAUSE WHEN I CAME OUT HERE
I MADE A COUPLE OF PROMISES
TO MYSELF ABOUT HOW I WOULD
PLAY.
FIRST I WANTED TO HAVE AT
LEAST ONE ALLY WHO I WOULD
BE WILLING TO TAKE TO THE
END WHO I COULD STRATEGIZE
WITH AND MAKE DECISIONS
WITH.
AND THAT WAS COCHRAN.
THE SECOND THING IS I WANTED
TO BE IN CONTROL OF MY OWN
GAME.
I WANTED TO BE PART OF
GROUPS WHERE WHEN WE MADE
DECISIONS IT INFLUENCED MY
GAME.
AND THE THIRD THING IS ITS
HARDEST PART, I HAD TO GIVE
MYSELF PERMISSION TO
ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME AND
BE WILLING TO USE THE THINGS
THAT IN MY NORMAL LIFE WHEN
I BUILD TRUST AND
FRIENDSHIPS WITH PEOPLE, I
DON'T EXPLOIT THEM.
AND SO I HAD TO COME OUT
RE-- REMINDING MYSELF THIS
IS A GAME FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS.
PANNED IF THIS IS FOOTBALL I
HAVE TO BE WILLING TO
TACKLE.
I FEEL PROUD OF THE GAME I
PLAYED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I
MADE THE HARD DECISIONS WHEN
I HAD TO.
AND THAT GOT US BOTH TO
WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
 Jeff: SHERRI, YOU'RE UP.
 SO YOU ALL KNOW ME AS THE
STAY AT HOME MOM.
AND I HAVE THREE CHILDREN.
AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR
18 YEARS AND ALL THIS IS
TRUE.
BUT I'M ALSO A VERY
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN.
I HAVE 75 EMPLOYEES.
AND I RUN SEVERAL
BUSINESSES.
AND WHEN I CAME INTO
SURVIVOR I WAS GOING TO PLAY
THE WAY I RUN MY BUSINESSES.
I WAS GOING TO LOOK AT ALL
OF YOU LIKE PEOPLE I DEAL
WITH ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.
AND, MI SO NERVOUS THIS IS
LIKE SO CRAZY.
BY AM JUST SO NERVOUS.
SO I HAD TO MAKE LIKE LOTS
OF DECISIONS AND BECOME VERY
PLIABLE TO GET MYSELF INTO
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE
TRIBE.
BECAUSE HERE I'M A FAN.
AND YOU GUYS ARE FAVORITES.
AND I HAD TO GET IN AND
INTEGRATE WITH EACH ONE OF
YOU.
AND I THINK I DID THAT VERY
SUCCESSFULLY.
BECAUSE SOMEHOW I'M STILL
SITTING HERE.
 Jeff: COCHRAN, OPENING
STATEMENT.
 I'M ALSO VERY NERVOUS BUT
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE
CULMINATION OF 13 YEARS OF
PASSION FOR SURVIVOR.
HALF MY LIFE N HIGH SCHOOL I
USED TO WEAR BFF EVERY NIGHT
SURVIVOR WAS ON, I USED TO
PASS OUT A NEWSLETTER.
I WROTE A PAPER ABOUT IT IN
LAW SCHOOL THIS IS AN
OBSESSION.
AND THE FACT THAT I'M HERE
NOW IS SURREAL AND AN HONOR.
HI NO FANTASY THAT I WOULD
BECOME ONE OF THE TOP TEN
CHALLENGE PERFORMERS IN
SURVIVOR HISTORY.
SOCIALLY I CONSIDER MYSELF A
SOCIALLY AWKWARD PERSON.
I HAVE ANXIETY BUT SOMEHOW I
KIND OF FELL INTO THE ROLE
OF LIKE THERAPIST, YOU KNOW,
WHEN PARANOIA WAS RAMPING
AROUND.
I WOULD STEP IN AND TRY TO
BE A CALMING FORCE WHICH IS
UNUSUAL FOR ME AND
STRATEGICALLY I'M PROUD OF
MYSELF.
I HAVE SEEN EVERY SEASON OF
SURVIVOR, I'VE NEVER SEEN A
COLLECTION OF THREATS LIKE
THIS I KNOW I CAN'T
OUTMUSCLE, OUTCHARM, I
DIDN'T THINK I CAN EVEN
OUTSTRATEGIZE ANYBODIMENT
BUT I CAN BEAT PEOPLE IN
TIMING.
AND THIS IS WHAT THIS GAME
HAS BEEN FOR ME, TIMING.
WHENEVER A THREAT EMERGED I
WOULD STRIKE BEFORE I COULD
BE STRUCK AT.
I LIED ALONGED WAY, DECEIVED
ALONG THE WAY AND I'M PROUD
OF IT AND I WANT TO OWN IT.
I WANT YOU TO BE AWARE WHY I
THINK I PLAYED THE BEST GAME
HERE.
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
THE QUESTIONS.
YOU CAN TEAR ME APART BUT I
WANT TO PROVE WHY I PLAYED
THE BEST GAME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY.
IN A MOMENT YOUR FIRST
CHANCE TO ADDRESS DAWN,
COCHRAN AND SHERRI AS ALWAYS
IN THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL,
YOUR JOB IS TO GET THE
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE
A MILLION DOLLAR DECISION.
I'M GOK GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO
THINK ABOUT IT
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY,
SOME YOU HAVE WAITED A
LONG TIME TO ADDRESS THESE
THREE.
THE GOAL IS SIMPLE.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
INFORMATION TO MAKE A
MILLION DOLLAR DECISION.
THIS IS IT.
LET'S GET STARTED, MALCOLM.
START US OFF.
 GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
I CONSIDER MYSELF A HUGE FAN
OF THE SHOW AND HAVING DONE
THIS BEFORE AND KNOW HOW BIG
OF A DEAL TO GET THERE YOU
GUYS ALL DID SOMETHING TO
GET THERE.
SHERRI, I DON'T HAVE A
QUESTION FOR YOU TONIGHT.
COCHRAN AND DAWN, REALLY MY
VOTE IS UP IN THE AIR
TONIGHT.
I THINK YOU BOTH PLAYED AN
EXTREMELY SMART GAME.
YOU WERE VERY STRATEGIC.
YOU MADE GREAT MOVES IN MY
OPINION.
SO DAWN, NO QUESTION BUT I
AM GOING TO BE YOUR BEST
FRIEND TONIGHT.
 OKAY.
 YOU PLAYED COLD BLOODED
AS HELL, I WOULD SAY.
AND YOU EVEN JUST SAID IN
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT
IS HOW WANTED TO COME OUT
HERE AND DO IT BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT
TOO.
 UH-HUH.
 YOU HAVE TO OWN IT
TONIGHT.
YOU CAN'T BE AFRAID OF
HURTING.
YOU CAN'T BE WARM, MOTHER OF
SIX WHO STABS PEOPLE IN THE
BACK IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE
THAT EVERYBODY UP HERE IS
SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THROUGH
IT.
IF YOU WERE COLD AND YOU
PLAYED HARD, THAN OWN AND
YOU PLAY HARD, FIGHT FOR IT
YOU FIGHT FOR T I WILL VOTE
FOR YOU.
 OKAY.
COCHRAN, MY QUESTION FOR YOU,
IF WILL YOU INDULGE MY
NARCISSISM FOR A MOMENT,
WHAT QUALITY DO YOU HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT
ALLOWED YOU TO BE SO
SUCCESSFUL AND GET TO THE
END OF THIS GAME?
 PROBABLY, AND THIS IS
GOING SOUND LIKE A JOKE BUT
IT IS BEING SINCERE.
PROBABLY A HEIGHTENED LEVEL
INSECURITY.
I WAS WITH PEOPLE LIKE
MINDED THAT GO WITH LONG
WITH MY PLAN.
I GOT INSECURE WHEN I HEARD
SOMEBODY ELSE HAD A PLAN OF
THEIR OWN.
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT AND THAT
IS A DEEP SEED INSECURITY
BUT I THINK MANIFESTED IN A
HEALTHY WAY BECAUSE I ENDED
UP TAKING OUT PEOPLE THAT
WERE A THREAT THAT HAD THEIR
OWN PLANS.
I KNOW THAT THAT CONTRIBUTED
GREATLY TO MY MOVES.
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE YOU
BEING INSECURE.
I GUESS THAT IS WHY I AM
IMPUNING THAT IS SOMETHING I
HAVE THAT YOU DON'T.
 THANKS.
 THANKS, MALCOLM.
 Jeff: EDDIE.
 ALL RIGHT, ONE DAY AWAY I
WAS.
I WAS JUST WITH ALL YOU GUYS
YESTERDAY.
SHERRI, ARE YOU WILLING TO
ADMIT THAT YOU GOT CARRIED
TO THE FINAL THREE OR ARE
YOU THINKING ARE YOU STILL
HERE FOR A STRATEGIC REASON?
 I DON'T THINK I GOT
CARRIED TO THE FINAL THREE.
 OKAY.
DAWN, WHAT TROUBLES ME THE
MOST ABOUT YOU IS YOU CAME
OUT HERE TONIGHT TALKING
ABOUT HOW YOU PLAYED THIS
STRONG GAME WEFERB AND YOU
WERE COLD HEARTED.
YET THE ONLY TIME I EVER SAW
YOU INTERACT WITH OTHER
PEOPLE YOU WERE THE WEAKEST
MOST FRAGILE PLAYER OUT HERE
ALL THE TIME N A CONSTANT
STATE OF PAR FLOWA.
EVERY TIME I SAW YOU OR WENT
TO APPROACH YOU OR ANYTHING
ELSE THAT HAPPENED, YOU WERE
RUN INTO A MENTAL BREAKDOWN
NOT WOODS.
IT BECAME ALMOST A DAILY
ROUTINE WHERE YOU WOULD GET
UP SET ABOUT SOMETHING AN
RUN OFF.
I'M HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME
CORRELATING HOW YOU WERE SO
WEAK BUT COMING OUT SAYING
NO, I HAVE BEEN STRONG THE
WHOLE TIME.
 I THINK I HAVE BEEN
STRONG BUT I THINK YOU'VE
SEEN THE WEAR OF THE GAME ON
ME.
I STILL WANT TO OWN THAT I
MADE THOSE DECISIONS, THAT I
TOOK FRIENDSHIPS AND
EXPLOITED THEM THAT I SAID
WE NEED TO VOTE THIS PERSON
OUT REGARDLESS OF HOW I FEEL
OR WHAT THEY DID FOR ME.
 OKAY.
COCHRAN, YOU HAD COME 180
FROM LAST TIME I SAW YOU
PLAY THIS GAMES ALIKE THIS
WEAKER, FEEBLE PLAYER AND
YOU WON FOUR CHALLENGES.
I'M BASICALLY JUDGING YOU ON
WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GO
FORWARD WITH THIS COMING OUT
OF THIS GAME.
IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THIS
SITUATION, YOU'RE AT THE BAR
WITH THE THREE AMIGOS, ME,
REYNOLD AND MALCOLM, WHERE
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?
ARE YOU NEXT TO US, ARE YOU
IN FRONT OF US OR ARE YOU
BEHIND US.
I WANT TO SEE REALLY HOW
THIS GAME IS GOING AFFECT
YOUR LIFE AFTERWARD.
 RIGHT.
I'M AT THE BAR WITH THEM.
I'M TELLING THAT YOU RIGHT
NOW.
NO HESITATION.
TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD GET
LIKE PANIC ATTACKS GOING TO
BARS OR PARTIES.
NOW I FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING
IT I THINK IT'S BEEN
MANIFEST IN THE WAY I PLAYED
THE GAME THIS TIME.
AND IT WILL BE ESPECIALLY
APPARENT WHEN WE HIT UP A
BAR.
I AM GEEK SITTING NEXT TO
YOU BUT WE WILL HAVE TWO
WOMEN ON EACH SIDE OF ME SO
THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT
PHYSICAL DISTANCE.
BUT I'M BEING SERIOUS.
I WOULD HANG WITH YOU GUYS.
AND IT IS A UNIQUE FEELING
FOR ME.
AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO
CHANGE HOW I INTERACT
SOCIALLY WITH PEOPLE WELL
BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF THIS
GAME.
 AWESOME, THAT'S ALL I
HAVE.
 Jeff: THANKS, EDDIE.
ALL RIGHT, PHILLIP.
 FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO
CONGRATULATE ALL THREE OF
YOU.
AS A GUY WHO MANAGED TO PLAY
FOR 39 DAYS, I KNOW THAT
SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAT
YOU GET WHEN YOU WAKE UP ON
THE 39th DAY AN YOU GO HEY,
I'M STILL HERE.
SO I AM GOING TO START FIRST
WITH YOU, SHERRI.
THE DAY THAT YOU MADE THE
DECISION THAT YOU WANTED TO
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND
TAKE YOUR FATE IN YOUR OWN
HANDS AND JOIN THE FAVORITES,
THAT WAS A STRATEGIC MOVE
THAT BEGAN THE PROCESS.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THAT YOU ARE SITTING
THERE RIGHT NOW.
HOWEVER, SHERRI, AS OF THIS
DAY FORWARD, ARE YOU NO
LONGER A MEMBER OF STEALTH
"R" US.
I'M NOW RESCINDING THAT AND
TAKING IT BACK.
SO I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER
FOR YOU.
DAWN.
 YES.
 WE HAD TO LIVE WITH
ALMOST SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
OF OH PIE GOD, THEY'RE GOING
TO VOTE FOR ME, THEY'RE
GOING VOTE FOR ME.
 I KNOW.
 I HAVE TOTAL INTOLERANCE
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO
COME OUT AND PLAY SURVIVOR
AND THEN SUDDENLY CRY AND
MAKE ALL KINDS OF EXCUSES
DURING THE GAME.
YOU MADE CAMP LIFE FOR MOST
OF US VERY DISRUPTIVE.
AND SO FOR ME, I FIND IT
VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY DAWN,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU ARE
SAYING NOW, THAT I WOULD
CAST A VOTE FOR YOU.
KWOK RAN, YOU-- COCHRAN, YOU
KNOW YOU PLAYED A VERY, VERY
STRATEGIC GAME.
DID YOU IT IN A
STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER.
I NEVER FELT THERE WAS ANY
MALICE TOWARD ANYBODY.
AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED
PLAYING THE GAME WITH YOU.
YOU ARE A REAL CLASS ACT.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: THANKS, PHILLIP.
ERIK.
 HEY, GUYS.
CON GRADLATIONS, FINAL
THREE.
I WANT TO TALK TO DAWN
FIRST.
 OKAY.
 WE HELPED EACH OTHER
THROUGH THIS AND I THOUGHT
WE SHARED SOMETHING THAT WAS
SO POWERFUL.
AND AFTER I SAW THE VOTE
WITH BRIDGEA-- BRENDA WHAT
WE HAD, YOU CRUSHED IT.
IT WASN'T GENUINE T WASN'T
SPECIAL.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DAMAGE
YOU CAUSED WHEN YOU PLAYED
THE GAME YOU PLAYED?
 I CAME INTO THE GAME THIS
TIME SAYING I WOULD USE THE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I MADE TO
ADVANCE MYSELF IN THE GAME.
AND I DID THAT BY BEING MORE
LOYAL TO COCHRAN AND THAT
ALLIANCE AND MORE LOYAL TO
WHO IS THE STRATEGIC THREAT
FOR ME AND WHO NEEDS TO GO.
THOSE WERE ALL HONEST
CONNECTIONS.
IT'S JUST I WAS PLAYING THE
GAME TO GET FURTHER.
 SHERRI, I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU.
IN THE SAME VEIN OF
AWARENESS, YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU ARE HERE RIGHT NOW?
 I'M HERE BECAUSE I PLAYED
THE GAME HARD.
 WHAT DID YOU --
 AS HARD AS I CAN PLY IT
BUT NOT THE WAY THAT YOU
GUYS THOUGHT I SHOULD PLAY
IT I PLAYED MY GAME.
 WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT
DIGGING INTO YOUR STRATEGY?
NOBODY IS CANNING YOU THOSE
QUESTIONS, ARE THEY?
 I'M NOT SURE.
 YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY.
 NO.
 WELL, I WOULD LIKE TOP
ENLIGHTEN YOU A LITTLE BIT.
YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING IN
THIS GAME.
YOU WERE A SEASHELL ON THE
BEACH THE ENTIRE GAME.
AND THAT'S WHY NO ONE --
 NASS'S YOUR OPINION, ERIK,
AND THAT'S FINE.
AND I DON'T CARE.
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
 I JUST WANT TO YOU --
 BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CAN SIT HERE AND
TALK DOWN TO ME BUT YOU CAN
HAVE A HOLIER THAN THOU
ATTITUDE LIKE ARE YOU
HAVING.
 FIRST OF ALL I'M TO
THE --
 YOU'RE HAVING THAT
ATTITUDE F ARE YOU DONE WITH
ME, I AM DONE WITH YOUMENT I
DON'T NEED TO LISTEN TO YOU,
OBVIOUSLY I AM NOT GOING TO
GET T I --
 I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP
YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU
SIT.
 I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
 ALL RIGHT.
 NOW YOU CAN SIT DOWN.
 THANKS, ERIC.
 Jeff: MICHAEL, YOU'RE UP.
 HELLO, HI, GUYS.
DAWN AND COCHRAN, WHEN I
HOOKED UP WITH YOU GUYS AT
THE SWAP AND STARTED
WATCHING YOU AND KNEW YOU
WERE PLAYING THE SAME GAME,
I WATCHED YOU GUYS
STRATEGIZE TOGETHER, VOTE
TOGETHER, BUT I FEEL THAT
DAWN, YOU'RE GETTING A
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PUNCH
GUT KIND OF THING.
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHY
MAYBE COCHRAN IS GETTING OFF
SCOT-FREE.
WHY IS HE TO THE BEING
CALLED A VILLAIN MAYBE THE
WAY THAT YOU ARE?
 I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE WAY THAT COCHRAN AND I
PLAYED THE GAME IS I
DEVELOPED THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH PEOPLE THAT GAVE THE
INFORMATION THAT WE NEEDED
TO MAKE THE VOTE THAT WOULD
TAKE PEOPLE OUT.
 SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE SAYING HE DOESN'T
HAVE AS MUCH BLOOD ON HIS
HANDS.
 I DON'T THINK HE HAS AS
MUCH BLOOD OR AS MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY.
AND I DON'T THINK HE WOULD
NECESSARILY BE HERE IF I
HADN'T DEVELOPED THE
RELATIONSHIP.
IN MY OPINION THERE ARE A
LOT OF DECISIONS IN THE GAME
WHERE COCHRAN DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING BUT KIND OF SHOW
UP AND SAY HOW DO I VOTE?
 COCHRAN, I JUST WANT TO
KNOW IF YOU THINK ALL THAT
DAWN IS GETTING IS WARRANTED,
WHETHER SHE WARRANTS THE
REACTIONS, I DON'T KNOW.
IN FULL DISCLOSURE I'M HAPPY
SHE'S RECEIVING THE
REACTIONS.
 THANKS, COCHRAN.
 I'M BEING HONEST.
I'M TO THE GOING HIDE
ANYTHING.
I'M HAPPY THAT PEOPLE SEEM
TO HAVE VENOM TOWARDS DAWN.
IN TERMS OF WHY I AM COMING
OFF CLEANER.
I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH
DAWN'S ASSESSMENT.
SHE DID SAYING WOULDN'T IT
BE IN THE GAME IF IT WEREN'T
HERE.
CERTAINLY THERE IS A
RECIPROCITY AND SYMBIOSIS IN
OUR RELATIONSHIP.
 I DIDN'T SAY NOT IN THE
GAME.
 YOU DID SAY THAT AT ONE
POINT.
THE PARANOIA THAT RAN RAM
WANT-- RAMPANT WAS CRIPPLING
TO THE ALLIANCE.
 I THINK A PARANOIA THAT
PROBABLY WAS FOSTERED
BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY
THAT WAS JUST
DIFFICULT-- MORE DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO DO THAN I REALIZED
IT WAS GOING TO BE.
I STILL DID IT.
 THAT'S JUST MY PORTION OF
THE ANSWER PHASE I THINK.
I DO FEEL YOU WERE AN
ABSOLUTE HUGE ASSET IN TERMS
OF GETTING INFORMATION.
BUT I ACTUALLY MADE THE
DECISIONS.
IF I HADN'T BECOME YOUR
THERAPIST, I DON'T THINK YOU
WOULD BE STILL IN THIS GAME.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: THANKS, MICHAEL.
REYNOLD, YOU'RE UP.
 DAWN, ALL RIGHT, I PRETTY
MUCH DISLIKED FROM YOU DAY
ONE BECAUSE I WAS LIKE DAWN
IS A COMPLETE FRAUD.
 OH.
 SHE IS THE FIRST ONE TO
GIVE AN OVER EMPHATIC HUG IF
SOMEONE STUBS THEIR TOE,
SHE'S THE ONE WHO LOOKS AT
YOU AND SAYS THAT IS
HILARIOUS.
 YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO DO
THAT.
 AND YOU ARE NOT EVEN
LAUGHING AT THE JOKE.
SO I THINK THAT YOU WERE
DISENGINE BUSINESS.
 OKAY.
 AND THE CHARACTER THAT
YOU CREATED WAS A FALSE
CHARACTER.
 ALL THOSE OBSERVATIONS
ABOUT MY PERSONALITY ARE
ACTUALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE I'M
NOT AWARE THAT MI-- IT
SOUNDS LIKE ARE YOU SAYING
PHONEY.
 I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE,
THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU
FREE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME?
 YEAH, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW -- DISH MEAN I HAVE --
 JUST SHOOT ME STREET.
 I HAVE MULTIPLE THOUGHTS.
 THREE ADJECTIVES REYNOLD.
 OH.
 DO IT TOO ME, DAWN.
 I JUST AM TRYING TO THINK.
 DO IT.
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF
OTHER PEOPLE, DO IT FOR ME.
 I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF
CHAUVINISTIC.
 YES, THANK YOU.
 I DO THINK YOU HAVE A
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
 THERE WE GO.
 AND I THINK THAT
SOMETIMES ARE YOU REALLY
VULGAR.
 YES, SO I CAN ACTUALLY
TAKE THAT COMPLIMENT THAT I
HAVE THIS GREAT SENSE OF
HUMOR, WHICH I DO, AND
BELIEVE YOU.
 YEAH, AGREED.
 BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME I'M A
CHAUVINISTIC CRUDER GUY THAN
YOU HANG OUT WITH AT THE
CHURCH OF MORMON.
AND LIKE-- THAT IS AWESOME.
THAT HAS SET YOU FREE.
 AND I APPRECIATE-- NO I
APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.
BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT
TRYING TO BE FAKE.
 SO WHAT I AM TELLING YOU
IS YOU CAN GO BACK AND BE A
GREAT PERSON BUT TELL THESE
PEOPLE, I KICKED YOUR ASS.
 I KICKED YOUR ASS IN THIS
GAME, BUT I STILL DO LOVE
YOU.
 AND I LIKED IT.
 A LITTLE BIT.
 A LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT.
 Jeff: ANDREA.
 YOU GUYS CAN ALL TAKE A
DEEP BREATH BECAUSE I'M NOT
BITTER, I HAVE NO MEAN WORDS
AND MI JUST GRATEFUL I WAS
ABLE TO PLAY WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU BLINDSIDE IMMEDIATE WITH
A HID ENIMMUNITY IDOL IN MY
BAG AND IT WAS AWESOME.
I'M NOT BITTER.
I THINK IT IS GREAT THAT YOU
GUYS ARE HERE.
SO FIRST COCHRAN, MY
QUESTION FOR SU IF YOU WERE
TO CHOOSE ONE ANIMAL THAT
YOU FEEL YOU PLAYED THIS
GAME MOST LIKE WHAT WOULD IT
BE.
 PROBABLY I WOULD SAY A
CHAM EELIAN, I WAS ABLE TO
CHANGE COLORS AT THE DROP OF
A HAT.
IF SOMEBODY I THOUGHT WAS A
TRUSTED ALLY, YOU KNOW,
PHILLIP WAS ONE OF MY
CLOSEST ALLY, A STEALTH "R"
US COLOURED CAMELIA, IT
GUESS IT IS DEBANDED, I HAD
TO CHANGE MY COLOURS.
I DID THAT WAS THE ADAPT
ABILITY AND TIMING THAT WAS
CRUCIAL TO MY GAME.
I THINK I HAVE BEEN MORE
WILLING AND ABLE TO CHANGE
AT THE DROP A HAT AND THAT
IS HOW I HAVE GOTTEN THIS
FAR.
 AWESOME ANSWER.
DAWN, I'M REALLY PROUD OF
YOU.
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE
DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU DID
PLAY A VERY STRATEGIC GAME.
I THINK IF I WAS IN THE
FINAL THREE I WOULD HAVE
PLAYED SIMILAR TO YOU.
I REALLY DEFINITELY TRIED TO
CONNECT TO PEOPLE AND THEN
WAS READY TO CUT THEM.
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE
COMING FROM.
 THANKS.
 THANK YOU, I'M PROUD OF
YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: BRENDA.
 LET'S DO THIS.
COCHRAN.
 YEAH.
 WE DIDN'T HAVE AN
EMOTIONAL BOND THE WAY DAWN
AND HI.
BUT ONE WAY THAT WE DID BOND
WAS AT THE FAMILY VISIT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU KNOW.
IN A WAY I FELT LIKE I GAVE
YOU SOMETHING.
AND THEN ALMOST INSTANTLY I
FELT LIKE YOU TOOK SOMETHING
FROM ME.
 YEAH.
 SO I WANT YOU TO REALLY
SELL ME ON IT OF WHY I
SHOULD GIVE TO YOU NOW.
 I DON'T KNOW-- IT KIND OF
SCARES ME.
I HAVE KIND OF DEVELOPED
THIS SOCIOPATHIC ABILITY TO
SEPARATE GAME AND EMOTION.
BEYOND THIS GAME I'M WILLING
TO PROVE MY GRATITUDE TO YOU
BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT AN
EMOTIONAL GIFT YOU GAME TO
ME, NOT A GAME PLAY GIFT.
IN TERMS OF TELLING YOU WHY
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR ME, I
THINK BECAUSE YOU WERE A
THREAT TO MY GAME AND I TOOK
OUT A THREAT TO MY GAME.
AND THAT IS I THINK THE CORE
OF SIR VIFER, TAKE OUT
SOMEBODY BEFORE THEY CAN
TAKE YOU OUT.
IT'S COLD BUT I THINK THE
TRUTH.
 OKAY.
DAWN, YOU KNOW HOW STRONG
THE BOND THAT I THOUGHT I
HAD WITH YOU WAS.
IT WAS SO STRONG.
GETTING VOTED OUT BY YOU, I
MEAN COCHRAN AND SHERRI DID
IT TOO, BUT BY YOU THAT IS
WHERE THE PAIN CAME.
LET'S TAKE IT BACK A LITTLE
BIT THAT DAY WHEN WE HEARD
SHRIEKS COMING FROM THE
JUNGLE IT WAS YOU, I SAW YOU
IN THE MOST VULNERABLE STATE
EVER.
 UH-HUH.
 WHEN YOU WERE LIKE
BRENDA, I'M GOING TO PULL
MYSELF FROM THE GAME IF I
DON'T GET MY RETAINER BACK.
AND I SAID NO, NO.
I SAID YOU'RE STAYING IN
THIS GAME, DAWN.
IT HAPPENED PERFECTLY WHERE
I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT FOR
YOU.
GIVE IT TO YOU.
YOU WERE SO GRATEFUL.
YOU SAID I OWE YOU
EVERYTHING.
 UH-HUH.
 BECAUSE OF YOU, BRENDA,
I'M IN THIS GAME.
I REALIZED AFTERWARDS I HAD
DAWN'S FATE IN THE GAME
LITERALLY IN MY HANDS.
 UH-HUH.
 TELL ME, WOULD YOU REALLY
HAVE GIVEN IT UP IF YOU
DIDN'T HAVE INJURE TEETH
BACK, SOMETHING COSMETIC.
WOULD YOU HAVE QUIT THIS
GAME IF I DID NOT GIVE YOU
BACK YOUR TEETH.
 NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE.
 I NEED TO YOU GO BEYOND
WORDS THIS TIME AND I NEED
YOU TO PROVE IT TO ME.
I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE YOU
THE WAY I SAW YOU THAT DAY.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE OUT YOUR
TEETH, DAWN.
 YEAH, I'M TO THE
REQUESTING TO DO THAT, I
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW --
 DAWN, IT'S MY THING, I
KNOW IT IS HARSH.
 I WILL TELL YOU, I PLAYED
A HARD GAME.
 BUT DAWN.
 I KNOW, I'M NOT
UNDERSTANDING.
 I WILL EXPLAIN IT.
I HAD YOUR FATE IN MY HAND
THAT DAY.
AND ARE YOU TELLING ME NO
YOU DIDN'T, I WOULD HAVE
STAYED IT REALLY WASN'T A
BIG DEAL.
IF YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT
YES, BRENDA I WOULD HAVE
STAYED IN THE GAME.
I'M STRONG, I'M A FIGHTER
THAT PROVE IT TO ME RIGHT
NOW.
 IF YOU ARE ASKING ME TO
TAKE THEM OUT AND HUMILIATE
MYSELF, I'M HAPPY TO DO
THAT.
BECAUSE TRUTHFULLY.
 OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
 I WILL DO T I REALLY WILL
BUT ALL I WANTED TO DO IN
THIS GAME WAS PLAY HARD.
 LET'S DO IT.
 I'M WILLING TO TAKE
ANYONE OUT WHEN I WANT TO
PLAY.
 THE WHOLE POINT, THE
WHOLE POINT OF MY THING
RIGHT NOW IS SHALL DID --.
 I'M HAPPY TO DO IT.
 NO TALKING, DO IT.
 THERE, THERE THEY ARE.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU.
I DID NOT WANT TO YOU
MINIMIZE MY WHAT I DID, THAT
IS WHY I DID THAT RIGHT NOW.
I WANTED YOU TO FEEL THAT
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF WHAT I
FELT.
 I UNDERSTAND THAT.
 A LITTLE BIT OF
HEARTBREAK.
 OKAY.
