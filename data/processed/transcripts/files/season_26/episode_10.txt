        The antecedent Summary of "Survivor"
Although the "top secret" group in control of the game
But still far from the overall efficient operation
Dawn struggled with depressed mood
I cried so often really funny
Andrea has been hooked up with the enemy
I can guarantee at least this round of voting will not take you
Phillip's leadership style
Not only angered opponents and even allies
Join Zan team important one condition
You must be loyal and absolutely reliable








Crazy they're all mad here
Organization welcomes you
Immunity challenge on Andrea exit
Brenda won the exemption
Brenda adhere to victory
Covert operations group have the opportunity to get rid of Malcolm
Before the old allies are trying to destroy the Union
We vote to go Malcolm chant
Andrea heard that you are in danger
We discussed ...
- I?
-
She tried to convince the allies
Safety sake or eliminated Michael
The safest or cast away Michael
I kinda like Malcolm
I know, but I think I was they focused on the








Tribal general meeting
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and want to use
Please show now
Brothers Not so fast
Malcolm felt the danger and to convince the Reynold
Give up his immunity idol
They cast me
To me I'm all right
But he was wrong Michael was sent home
Michael tribe has decided to
Left 10 people who will be eliminated tonight?
I think we should hold a meeting
Will not open?
Into, we'll be right back
And so we are to open?
Those at the bottom, you are welcome
So do ah I feel very good
In fact, at the bottom is not so bad
- We have nothing to fear
-
Nobody speaks ill of us behind because ...
At the lowest level we understand it?
Now all my plans are messed up
I would like to bring I think that is the bottom Dawn
Dawn has never been a group and I
And never has been with me
I just want everyone to understand that at a meeting of the tribe
- Phillip let slip
-
Really a nightmare day
- I think the end of the life of my double-sided agents
- We can beat them immunity challenge
They do not have statues
Even if we can sub-vote
They did not statues statues
- We'll have to find
- Yeah
I just said
Tomorrow we want to find the hidden immunity idol
Tomorrow we have to work together to find
The only optimism I have a statue
Also holds a little bit of power
Little bit do not have a lot of
But we go have to go vigorous
At the bottom do not have walked

Reynold Dawn Erik Phillip and I
About our incentive to win Resort
The face is put a table full of food
The various shrimp skewers beef string fried chicken squid
Was more that we could not eat
Almost a month I did not eat beef.
- Days blanket
- Healthy eating protein is very important
This is where I need to match the energy
Continue to act as the king of the Challenge
I have proved
Soap eh
I found that I already have 26 days did not screw Pompon head
Soap
Just the aroma of soap has been very strong
This is probably my favorite part of the
I need it I have been a little madness Britain
I think this game is the most difficult to accept
Will make you a bit schizophrenic
Mood is more anxious to become fast
Come on down
Is in need of a bath.
The shadow just you spread
Phillip rude
There is a small pond bath
Phillip headed out into the big pool of mud and rice
These disgusting things to the large pool inside
- You naked?
- As early as bare
- Are you naked?
- I bare
This is the season Phillip style
Regardless of whether the focus on their jump into things
I continue to keep really irks Phillip
I love life
I'm tired
Three days I probably only slept for 2-4 hours
The head did not break so I
The next phase of what will happen a little worried
I am very suspicious was assassinated out
"I'm out of 7 in what position?"
"I think the allies are not really allies?"
Andrea any connection with Malcolm and
Eddie get along with a lot of
She told them to play a go
Eddie Reynold and Malcolm
One would like to draw our 7
They will be able to Murdering
Andrea mutiny
They voted with Malcolm and our sub-vote
They just 4 votes can be eliminated
They have four votes she would do it
Listen to me Andrea is one of the objectives
You screw up betrayed Union
- Tang you out
- Yes
I told them that Andrea would not be the first target
But now I may be eyeing other people
Dawn paranoid ah
Because she is completely crazy lose his cool
You are not the target
- The most important thing is to do as usual
-
- Such as today
-
Dawn believes Andrea mutiny
Cast her Dawn leave
Dawn will be sure that she will be cast
Makes me feel a bit baffling
Frankly order to me a little suspicious Dawn
I like a little charred
Well soon
- Like some?
-
I am very pleased not hungry
- Not tired
- I do not know what to do
- I was too uncomfortable
- What?
How?
I rest
She was out of control
- Who are you?
- Dawn
I just took a piece of coconut
- I do not know how to do
- You do not have to do anything
I did not do anything wrong she ...
She was out of control this is not a good thing
-
- She is living in a skeptical world
She ...
I do not know that this is not appropriate
There is no other place to go
I really think ... they are a little mental instability
Is a bit too much pressure on
I think I need a little time alone alone
I should not be so weak sorry Cochran
Is still very strong despite cried very powerful
I cry more than a small baby
Really
Zan season has already gotten a madman
Brandon Hantz he is gone
But suddenly a suspect madman
Called Dawn
I'm tired of crying
Good morning
I fell asleep
Well
God
- Do you have to keep dry?
- I slept all night
Good good
Yeah
Today is the day 28
Last entry is to leave on this day
But after yesterday's crash crisis
I got up this morning feel is back
This game is not very clear head overwhelmed me
I fell asleep feel like reloading
You need
This is the weight of the game I can not breathe
Himself from the control
But today I feel good
Confidence in our alliance
Our team to a short meeting
I feel the need
- I joined
-
-
- Dawn calmed down
We're about to start a tribal meeting
By Phillip led the "top secret" group
Decided lined up like ducks
The decision to phase out tonight who
Reynold or Malcolm who goes first?
I would like to Reynold leave
- Reynold
- Reynold
I'd rather out of Reynold
- I think the first vote Reynold
- I think the first vote Reynold
Because every game that guy is great
His great physical strength
I want him to go first
- Tonight ... tonight can not go wrong
-
As long as we have this plan as long as we say good
- It is all right
- Four girls vote for Reynold
7 of us on the three of them
We divided votes
Because we can have 4 vote Reynold
Prevent him from statues or other pattern
The remaining three votes and give Malcolm
Destroy all statues that may occur
I do not want to be too confident
But my Union has a number of advantages
I am elated ah
Top-secret action
- Guys ready for today's immunity challenge?
-
First things first Brenda return of the exemption
The waiver the necklace again to return to compete for
Today's game divided into two groups
After the start of the game players first ran across the platform
Jumped into the water
And then pull the rope to go back downstream from the platform
Climbed the platform to get a circle
Add to second column
Completion of each group of the first two players into the final
The final player to win to win the exemption
To ensure access to a few strong Malcolm
- IX
- The opportunity to ensure that the ninth to win "Survivor"
The rest of the players spent twenty-eight days after the

Would it be?
Andrea is complete
Andrea Reynald together into the final
Well you
The following five players into the water
I better than Jeff
And so on and so on what conditions
I give up the game
- Phillip does not intend to race
- Do not participate in this competition
- Why?
- I was a kid in the water the accident occurred
I particularly uncomfortable game content
- Because in the water for a long time?
-
Well
The other four in the past to prepare
You the opportunity to win an exemption
A 20% increase
Phillip abstained
Twenty-eight days after the game the only way to

Everyone has the opportunity
The second round will be decisive
Leading Malcom and Eddie
Malcom finals
Eddie into the decision ...
Eddie did not go in the trap
Left Brenda and Erik opportunities
Who is it?
Brenda and Malcom finals
Eddie made a big mistake
Steady final good
A five circles
Only one winner
To participate in the tribal council tonight with this necklace
Nine other people would be in danger
The Reynold Andrea Brenda and Malcolm
Two men and two women
Steady prepare ...
Departure
Five back and forth definitely you will be totally exhausted
The Malcolm and Reynald together water
Followed by Andrea and Brenda
Malcolm slightly ahead of Ronald
But the game still has a long
Malcolm and Ronald water again
Two into the water at the same time
Andrea and Brenda began to fall behind
Ronald leading Malcom slightly behind
The two is just about the same
Ronald first water
Malcolm appear to be dropping
Ronald completed the fourth lap
Malcom finished fourth lap left circle
Or break
Who will take the lead in the water?
Is Reynold
The Reynold win exemption
- I win!
- Yes, you win
Each player doing all
- Reynold you still had the strength to swim over take the exemption?
-
Reynold congratulate you
Can safely participate in the Assembly of
To ensure access to nine strong
But as for you tonight someone will be eliminated
Take things back to the camp tribe met
Completely unexpected
- And the play opening
- Too much fun
We are dejected
These guys are ruthless
They want to eliminate me because I was the biggest threat to
Exemption necklace in the neck can be arbitrary
Good kind of Reynold
I have a thing ...
To tell you that
I despise Phillip
To put it plainly he lip
Immunity challenge is not to participate simply perverse
Especially him
There are lions and gorillas tattoo
Funny it buddy
- I would like to talk to you
-
- We are still divided votes
-
I tribal leaders dignities
Since that may just be possible
Into the top three
If these people do not remember Qianchou
I may be true chance to win
Tell you my plan
We divided votes
The number of than 3 such benefits is
In any case it does not matter
Malcolm statues
Then Malcolm four votes Eddie three votes
One of the two men home
Malcolm statues that he sat ...
... Await death, oh
Nobody
My life on the line
But I have a statue
In any case I used the statue would not go home
But the idea is to get through this vote
And continue to hold the statue
I feel like we just missed
I fully looking statue of a man
I believe there
- Here
-
There may be somewhere stream ended in failure statues
I have a few hours to have nothing to do
Nobody can curry favor with
Maybe dreams really can come true
Childhood, when I have the time trapped
In a pond
I have a ...
I think that ...
Wellhead possession of the statue is the most likely place
- In the water will be worse
- I agree
Andrea said after the game we go to find the statues
I said OK because this is the real work time
I do not want to sit in the camp for so long
This is millions of dollars of contention
That's it ...
Not fun
I do not want to participate in this project
This stupid thing could be anywhere
Really looking for a needle in a haystack
- Malcolm behind it?
- What?
Told me in the back, then I'll help
I could not
Reminded not it?
Know not
- What?
- You said
You just found
Your voice faded I saw
God fierce
Is this your possession
- Swear to God you say when I see the heart beat violently.
- Well hell
Suddenly Malcolm reach out in front of us
Find the hidden immunity idol in a crevice
-
- Malcolm You're great
The good kind
Malcolm was going to get out, but he
Most needed time to find statues
So it may have to go home Eddie
- Malcolm just found a statue
- In front of you?
-
- We behind him
- Just come back
- He opened in front of us
So ...
The original plan? Because if he does not.
Do not panic does not matter
4 female cast Malcolm male cast Eddie
If he will probably statues
- Will re-enter the
- Very good
- To rejoin Eddie go
- Very good
Do not show know that he has statues normal point
- Make sure he looked to you?
- Statues
- Who cares?
-
We have a number of baby child
So ... Reynold won exemption
Safe and secure
Malcolm have immunity idol
Now I'm big bad
Because the only chance I survived down
They decided to phase-out of Malcolm and not me
And now the whole tribe know
He has immunity idol
I'm going home
Please have a jury
The last tribal council to be eliminated Michael
Based on the last tribal council
Look Reynold
Eddie and Malcolm three of you are still marginalized
Fully agree with the
So today's immunity challenge
Either win immunity or would definitely go home
Eddie, do you agree?
Yes, the three of us in order to stay in the game
Someone must always try to get immunity
You want to try to get positive energy
I will always remember all the things here
Andrea Eddie put it seems
Would definitely go like
Indeed the case against him
Because Malcolm happened to
Find the hidden immunity idol
So say we all know you have statues
- We were in that
- Yeah
Dawn and I was walking and Malcolm turned
From the rock statues
When he needs most statues when he found the
Cochran, so we are aligned with Eddie
Is actually
Not the first choice of everyone tonight
Who is the first choice?
May be Reynold
He is the kind with a personal charm and climb to the top of the
He won the immunity
We regard him as the greatest threat to
Phillip, on the other hand today talking about the Challenge
You made history
I can not remember the player in the absence of food or
The other incentives temptation voluntary on the sidelines game
When I was young and a group of boys go swimming
I'm stuck on a pier below I am panic
Fortunately, I found the owner
I saved up
This has been a lingering shadow of my heart
I will always make such a decision for me
Justified
Andrea camp life how?
We are very suspicious
That we do not and Reynold
Eddie and Malcolm conversation
I'm pressure Alexander I kinda like their company
But it makes a lot of people to me suspicious.
'd Become a target
Malcolm anxiety?
Reynold Eddie and I at the periphery
As if we had the plague
But this is the game we should act
Tonight we intend to do so
This is another one I've been to some immunity idol
I intend to give Eddie
I found some time
Today to find a
I want to get this straight
Wait to see everyone's face
Andrea did not look up
Malcolm tribal council rarely become so crazy
{\ A10} - we want to vote for who?
- Andrea
Dawn and Brenda closeted
Cochran and Erik whispering
Andrea hand holding head
What a huge shift.
To this effect
We still whispering
{\ A10} - you want to do?
- Do not know
We are suspicious at the moment
Are worry about whether they will vote for yourself
Anyway, the three of us will not leave
Just this once
- Malcolm I have been to interrupt you
- Nothing
We still discuss
{\ A10} - how to do?
- Phillip must
I want someone suspended
And then the other nine by one by one out
We firmly in control of this vote
Close group of seven people go.
Dawn 20 seconds before you control the game
To be honest I'm not quite sure at the moment the situation of the game
What you say I like this fainted
For me, the game changes every day
Malcolm you just what to say
I want to say what we will not leave
Tonight we are safe, but tomorrow
The case will not have much change
Or three against six people we know
But tonight the three of us want to vote for Philip
I do not have to illustrate the specific reason
You mind clear
This game should be fun
{\ A10} - Andrea
- What?
But no longer fun
{\ A10} Why? I can not do
I'm here to enjoy the game
You mean Philip
Philip is the source of all this nonsense
This is still the game
But do not have to get this military stuff
We are in basic training
I'm not so game
He tried to give me dubbed without some offense
Oh wow how?
Andrea you should think
Vote for Phillip I know how to write his name
Two L-head and tail of two P
We can not immediately communicate with each other
I know I am a target
Although I believe they will vote for Philip
I suspect many
If this is to come duplicitous how to do
Does not happen
Indeed I am afraid
- Can I say a few words?
- Of course
The three men say they have the gods, and the use of
But if bold enough
They can retain a statue
One person may not use the statues
Philip's new argument
A statue of the wearing does not mean what
Before roll call, they want to give me statues
I think we should be in accordance with
To discuss good plan before vote
If I leave, I leave
I would prefer to leave as
Because it is carried out in accordance with the strategy
Do not hurt my personality
Cochran
You wrote a lot of papers on "Survivor"
You studied this game
At the moment you have any idea?
I am at the moment, there are two extreme ideas
Fans of the program must be at home will want
This in the end doing
This is really the history of the most bizarre tribal council
Whispering to each other plans to change the voting
On the tribal council, but extremely rare
The vote will be the gambling
Dawn If this is want eliminated
Six others were one
And they are just as Philip smoke bomb.
They just use a few votes out of a person
People in the Union and not Philip
Voting problems we encounter
The three men will vote for who
Another seven people who vote for
Eddie and Malcolm will use the immunity idol?
Good in the history of the craziest tribal councils
You go first vote Philip
No matter what happens tonight
I am keen "Survivor" 13 years of reasons
I went to the vote count
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and want to use
Now show
Thank you, thank you
Vote for Eddie and
Malcolm ticket will be void
I'll roll call
The dead grave eggs are Bring it on
First ticket Malcolm void
Malcolm void
Eddie void
Eddie void
Eddie void
Eddie void
You're popular
Philip, one vote Phillip

"Survivor: Fans of the star articles out of 11
That two members of the jury Phillip
Three votes is enough torches used
Philip tribe has decided to

Much more than you think
I think I am better than great
Very satisfied with the way the game

Others did not appreciate what I did
This makes me sad
I feel good feel like doing a good job
