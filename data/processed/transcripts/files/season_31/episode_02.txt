 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," YOU WILL GET A
SECOND SHOT.
AFTER BEING PICKED BY AMERICA,
20 FORMER PLAYERS TRAVEL TO
CAMBODIA.
THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND
CHANCE TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY
PLAYED THE FIRST TIME AND TO
FINISH WHAT THEY STARTED.
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR:








CAMBODIA--SECOND CHANCE."
 I'M HERE TO WIN $1 MILLION.
WHEN IT'S ALL DONE, I'LL PRAY
FOR FORGIVENESS.
 Jeff: THE TA KEO TRIBE --
 DID YOU SEE MY BAG?
MY BRACELET IS INSIDE.
 Jeff: ABI WAS BATTLING
HERSELF.
 IT'S SO HARD FOR ME NOT TO
PULL OUT MY THINGS.
THE BRACELET.
 Jeff: BUT THE REAL BATTLE
WAS BETWEEN TWO STYLES OF PLAY,








OLD SCHOOL AND NEW SCHOOL.
THE NEW SCHOOL WAS ALL ABOUT
STRATEGY.
 I WANT TO PULL AWAY PEOPLE I
WANT TO WORK WITH AND JUST LOCK
IT DOWN.
 Jeff: WHILE THE OLD SCHOOL
WAS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND
SURVIVAL.
 IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE OLD
SCHOOL THAN ME.
 Jeff: IT WAS THE VETERAN
WHO FOUND HIMSELF STUCK IN THE
MIDDLE.
 I DON'T CARE WHO IS PULLING
ME IN THE WOODS.
YES IS YOUR ANSWER.
 Jeff: AT THE BAYON TRIBE,
THE STRONG MEN BONDED TOGETHER,
BUT STEPHEN DIDN'T FIT IN AND
HIS TRIBE BECAME SUSPICIOUS THAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 I THINK HE'S TRYING THE LOOK
FOR AN IDOL.
 OH, REALLY?
 Jeff: IN A "SURVIVOR"
FIRST, KELLY FOUND AN IDOL
HIDDEN AT THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, BUT IT WAS JOE WHO
FOUND SUCCESS.
JOE WINS IMMUNITY!
IT ONLY GOT WORSE FOR TA KEO.
WE ARE HEADING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
RIGHT NOW.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, VARNER HAD TO
DECIDE WHICH WAY TO GO.
 THIS IS MY SECOND CHANCE.
I DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP.
IN THE END, ABI GOT FOUR VOTES.
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: CAMBODIA" -- BUT
VYTAS GOT SENT HOME.
NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL, FIRE IN THE FORM OF
FLINT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
BACK AT CAMP.
19 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
DEVASTATING.
I DIDN'T EXPECT VARNER TO FLIP.
IT KIND OF SUCKS TO BE ON THE
BOTTOM.
IT'S NOT HOW I WANTED TO START
OUT THE SECOND CHANCE.
MY GROUP NEED TO GET THEIR CRAP
TOGETHER.
THEY SET THE SPACE.
WE HAVE TO START DEFENDING
OURSELVES OR WE'RE DIDN'T HERE.
YESTERDAY WE WENT FROM THE
CHALLENGE STRAIGHT THE TRIBAL,
SO I NEED THE FIND SOME TIME TO
READ MY IDOL, WHICH I'VE BEEN
HOLDING ON.
TO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CLUE SAYS.
 THE IDOL.
 THIS SECOND CHANCE SEASON IS
ALREADY INSANE.
I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF SECURITY.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
I'M SO EXCITED.
OH, MY GOD.
YES!
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS A GREAT DAY.
PLAYING A SECOND TIME, HAVING A
SECOND CHANCE, I JUST WANT TO DO
EVERYTHING THAT I DIDN'T DO THE
FIRST TIME, AND I WANT TO BE
AGGRESSIVE, AND I WANT TO BE A
PLAYER.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
THIS IS A SECOND CHANCE.
GO BIG OR GO HOME.
YES!
 WE HAVE A GOOD GROUP, YOU
KNOW?
 YEAH.
I WOULD LIKE TO DECIDE WHO IS
NEXT NOW.
 SHOULDN'T IT PROBABLY BE LIKE
SOMEONE IN THE RACE?
 IT'S FINE WITH ME.
 AFTER VYTAS WENT HOME, THERE
WAS DEFINITELY A SENSE THAT THE
NEW SCHOOL GOT THE BETTER OF THE
OLD SCHOOL ON THE FIRST VOTE.
WIGLES WORTH MISSED THE VOTE.
 I BLIND SIDED THEM.
I HOPE THAT SHOWS YOU LOYALTY.
THERE'S NINE PEOPLE ON THIS
TRIBE.
WITH ABI WE HAVE FIVE.
WE SHOULDN'T WORRY.
 SPENCER AND SHIRIN ARE QUITE
COMFORTABLE, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
THEY SHOULD BE AS COMFORTABLE AS
THEY ARE.
MY WHOLE PLAN WITH VOTING OUT
VYTAS WAS TO TEACH THE OLD
SCHOOLERS TO PLAY THIS GAME
FINALLY AND TO GET THE PACE TO
GET RID OF SHIRIN AND SPENCER.
THEY'RE PLAYING WAY TOO HARD
STRATEGY-WISE.
I WANT TO GET ONE OF THEM OUT OF
THE MIX.
I DIDN'T WANT ABI TO GO.
I DON'T THINK ABI'S THE RIGHT
ONE TO GO.
ABI'S EASY.
THIS GAME IS MOVING LIKE
LIGHTNING, TERRY, AND ALL OF
THESE THREATS HAVE GOT TO GO.
IT CAN'T BE LIKE NAMES IN
PASSING.
THAT'S OLD SCHOOL.
 RIGHT.
 THIS IS A NEW DAY.
I DO NOT WANT US TO LOOK LIKE WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.
THAT VOTE LAST NIGHT WAS A
WAKE-UP CALL.
GET OFF YOUR ASS AND PLAY THIS
GAME.
THIS IS NOT 2001.
I WANT TO VOTE OUT SPENCER OR
SHIRIN.
THOSE TWO ARE PLAYERS.
THEY GOT TO GO.
IF I'M GOING TO THE END WITH A
GROUP, I'M GOING WITH Y'ALL.
I'M NOT GOING WITH THEM.
 I LEFT TRIBAL COUNCIL FEELING
LIKE CRAP, BUT VARNER IS HITTING
THE BEACH HARD AND PLAYING THE
GAME.
"SURVIVOR" HAS CHANGED.
MY SECOND CHANCE INCLUDES TERRY
OBVIOUSLY HAVING TO PLAY A
SOCIAL GAME OR I WILL SEE MY
BUTT VOTED OUT.
 YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
SAYING IN.
 WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THING.
 I'M LOOKING FOR A SPY SHACK.
 I CAN DO ANYTHING I PUT MY
MIND TO.
I WANT TO HAVE FUN OUT HERE.
I WANT TO DO STUFF.
NO ONE LIKES SLEEPING ON THE
BAMBOO, SO I SAID, YEAH, I THINK
I'M GOING THE MAKE A HAMMOCK.
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED I WAS THE
BIGGEST THREAT, NO QUESTIONS
ASKED.
SO COMING INTO THIS SEASON, IT'S
NICE BEING IN A ROLE WHERE I
FEEL LIKE I AM PROVIDING A
SERVICE.
 THIS DON'T SUCK AT ALL.
 I WANT TO BE SOMEONE THAT
PEOPLE NEED AND WANT AROUND.
 ISLAND PARADISE.
 OH, HECK, YEAH.
 TAKE A BIG ONE.
THEN WE'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE
ONE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
ANOTHER ONE?
 NOT RIGHT NOW.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
JOE IS ALWAYS COMING UP WITH
IDEAS.
WHAT CAN I BUILD NEXT?
WHAT NEW, AMAZING CONTRAPTION
CAN I BUILD TO MAKE "SURVIVOR"
BETTER.
 IT'S CRAZY BEING ON A TRIBE
WITH JOE.
HE'S SURVIVOR MacGIEFER.
HE'S ALWAYS BUILDING A HAMMOCK
OR GOING FISHING.
 I GOT SOME FISH.
 THROW SOME SHRIMP ON THE
BARBIE.
JOE'S TOO GOOD FOR HIS OWN SELF.
HE'S TOO MUCH OF THE GOLDEN BOY,
BEAUTIFUL THREAT.
 JOE IS REALLY GOOD AT ISLAND
LIFE.
I MEAN, YEAH.
 JOE'S A GUY WHO IS PERFECT AT
THE BEGINNING, WINS ALL THE
CHALLENGES, BUILDS THE SHELTER
AND THEN YOU SLIT HIS NECK RIGHT
WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE.
 YOU FEEL OKAY, RIGHT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I'M JUST VERY AWARE.
I'M NOT DONE.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I GOT FOUR
VOTES.
IF IT WAS ME BACK IN "SURVIVOR:
PHILIPPINES," I WOULD HAVE
EXPLODED.
I'M WORKING ON IT.
I TRY TO ACT LIKE THE NEW ABI I
WANT TO BE.
 HOW DID YOU DO THE CHIMNEY IN
CHINA ON THE FIRE?
 SO BASICALLY BLOCK OIT ALL
THE WIND AROUND IT.
IT'S EASY TO KEEP GOING.
 SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WHAT?
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WE'RE BUILDING A FIRE
CHIMNEY.
 JUST RELAX.
WE'RE SERIOUSLY BUILDING A FIRE
CHIMNEY.
 ABI IS AN ABSOLUTE DRAMA
QUEEN.
THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO TRUST
SOMEONE LIKE THAT TO PROTECT MY
INTERESTS IS THE MOST
FRIGHTENING THING I'VE HAD TO DO
IN ALL OF "SURVIVOR."
YOU GUYS OKAY?
 OF COURSE.
I'M FINE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO CONNECT WITH
THIS FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE GOING
ON.
 I FEEL LIKE I AM IN A GOOD
POSITION, BUT ABI IS LIKE THE
PERMANENT LIABILITY.
SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THIS BODY
WEIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO LUG
AROUND.
 SO I WATCH UP TO THEM AGAIN.
 WHY NOT?
 I'LL BE ANNOYING.
 ABI IS HERE THE START FIGHT,
AND THAT IS CANCER FOR A TRIBE,
AND IT'S DEATHLY CANCER FOR AN
ALLIANCE.
 HERE SHE COMES.
 SO...
 I OFFERED YOU ONE.
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.
 I WANT TO BE PART OF THE
TALK.
 ABI IS OUR OWN BRAZILIAN SOAP
OPERA THAT WE CAN TURN ON AND
WATCH.
THERE ARE BUTTONS YOU PUSH.
 WHAT ARE YOU WHISPERING
ABOUT?
 THERE ARE THINGS THAT GO ON
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAR.
 OH, YEAH?
 I SEE ABI AS SOMEONE EVERYONE
HATES.
SHE'S THE PERFECT FOOL TO HELP
ME WIN $1 MILLION.
 IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME, YOU
MIGHT HEAR A LITTLE MORE, BUT I
DON'T THINK YOU CAN RUN THAT
FAST.
 OH, MY GOD, THIS IS
DELICIOUS.
WHO NEEDS FOOD WHEN YOU HAVE
ABI.
 I WAS IN CHICAGO.
ONE OF OUR CLIENTS WAS PLAYBOY
ENTERPRISES.
I MET MY WIFE WHEN SHE CAME TO
MY OFFICE.
ON MY DESK WAS ALL THESE
"PLAYBOY" MAGAZINES.
 HOW DID YOU MEET YOUR WIFE?
 SO MY WIFE WAS A TOP MODEL IN
SOUTH AFRICA IN A LAWSUIT, AND
SHE WON A BEAUTY CONTEST AND THE
PRIZE WAS A TRIP AROUND THE
WORLD, AND SHE STOPPED IN
AMERICA TO SEE MY ROOMMATE.
THEY WERE FRIENDS.
I'M ON TRIAL.
I COME HOME WITH MY SUIT, AND
THERE'S THIS MOST GORGEOUS
BRUNETTE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY
HOUSE.
AND I NEARLY FAINTED.
YOU COULD TAKE A KNIFE AND CUT
THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN US.
IT'S LIKE FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THEN SHE WENT TO CALIFORNIA AND
THEN SHE CAME BACK AND... SHE'S
MY WORLD.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
 SO SHE CAME BACK.
 SHE CAME BACK AND WE WERE
MARRIED THREE MONTHS LATER.
 THAT'S AWESOME.
 GREAT STORY.
 MY LAST SEASON MY FELLOW CAST
MEMBERS WERE HORRIBLE.
THIS TIME SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
SO IF THEY MAKE ME A BETTER
PERSON AND A BETTER PLAYER, I'LL
TAKE IT.
 THAT IS SO SWEET.
 I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE
FEELINGS IN THIS GAME.
AND THAT WAS A FAULT IN MY PRIOR
GAME IS ASSUMING EVERYONE HAD
COMPARTMENTALIZED THIS AND WE
WERE GOING TO GO PLAY POKER AND
SOMEONE WAS GOING TO WIN.
I REALIZE NOT EVERYONE BEHAVES
IN THAT MANNER OUT HERE.
WE'RE REAL PEOPLE AND I'M GOING
TO BE A REAL PERSON THROUGHOUT
THIS.
 BE ALL BUSINESS.
BRINGING UP THAT STORY WITH HIS
WIFE, YEAH, IT TOUCHES YOU, YOU
KNOW, IT MAKES YOU THINK.
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT.
I JUST WANT TO SEE HER STOMACH,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I WANT TO BE THERE TO SEE IT
GROW.
I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY.
I GOT SO MUCH RIDING ON ME
ANYWAY, I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO
COME AFTER ME AS A PHYSICAL
THREAT.
AND YOU'RE GOING TO ADD ON THAT
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT, NO ONE IS
GOING TO WANT THE TAKE ME TO THE
END.
I GOT TO CONTROL THIS A LITTLE
BIT.
VAL KNOWS HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO
ME AND TO HER, YOU KNOW?
SHE'S THE REASON WHY I'M DOING
THIS, YOU KNOW?
 WHAT'S THAT?
 ARE WE ALL CONCERNED WITH
JEREMY?
 ARE YOU?
 HERE'S THE THING ABOUT
STEPHEN, FIRST REACTION IS
JEREMY'S LOOKING FOR AN IDOL AS
OPPOSED TO JEREMY HAS A
WONDERFUL WIFE AND KIDS, MAYBE
MY STORY AFFECTED HIM AND HE
NEEDED SOME PRIVATE TIME.
THAT JUST TELLS ME THAT FISH IS
PLAYING THE GAME 24/7.
ALL HE CARES ABOUT THAT IDOL AND
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GAME, NO
EMOTION.
 YOUR STORY, MAN, ABOUT YOUR
WIFE...
 IT HIT YOU HARD, TOO?
 GET IT OUT.
 YOU GOT TO GET IT OUT.
STEPHEN'S ASKING IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.
 HE COMES UP TO YOU AND SAYS
THAT?
 YEAH.
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU WHERE HIS
HEAD IS.
HE'S KIND OF LACKING IN SOME OF
THE THINGS THAT REALLY MEAN
EVERYTHING TO ME AND MY TRIBE,
MORALS AND VALUES, LOYALTY,
DIGNITY, COURAGE.
WHETHER I LIKE THE GUY OR NOT,
HIS TIME OUT HERE, IF IT'S UP TO
ME, IS GOING TO BE LIMITED.
 I ASKED HER TO GET SOME OF
THESE SEEDS TO PUT THEM IN THE
RICE, AND SHE'S LIKE, MY BACK
HURTS.
I'M DONE, MY BACK HURTS.
SHE'S SITTING THERE IN THE
SHELTER.
 I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU JUST
SAID.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT TO ME?
I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
ME AND THAT I ANNOY YOU AND YOU
CAN'T STAND ME.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO.
 I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH PEIH-GEE.
ABI OVERHEARSAY IT -- ABI
OVERHEARS IT AND IT ERUPTS INTO
A FIGHT.
 YOU WERE GOING AROUND TELLING
EVERYBODY YOU THOUGHT I STOLE MY
BRACELET.
HOW DOES THAT MAKE ME FEEL, HUH?
 I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.
 HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR
NAME WAS PUT DOWN FOUR TIMES.
 ABI IS TALKING ABOUT THE
VOTES FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME.
I STARTED WALKING AWAY.
IT WAS ALL VERY AWKWARD AND
PAINFUL TO WATCH.
 MAYBE WE GOT OFF ON THE WRONG
FOOT THEN.
 YEAH, I GUESS SO.
 SEE, THIS IS THE THING, WHEN
YOU DO THAT, OH, WHATEVER.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL
YOU?
YOU ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION?
 YOU KNOW WHAT, ABI, I CAN
WORK WITH EVERYBODY.
OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH NUMBERS.
 OF COURSE I WAS EMBARRASSED
TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TALKING
ABOUT SOMEBODY BEHIND THEIR
BACK, BUT EVERYBODY IS FED UP
WITH HER, OKAY.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND
ON THIS ISLAND.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 THAT FELT GOOD.
 THE PEOPLE I THOUGHT I WAS
ALIGNED WITH ARE LAUGHING AT ME
RIGHT NOW.
AND THE REASON WHY I WANTED TO
WORK WITH HER IS BECAUSE SHE
FELT LIKE NOBODY HAD HER BACK ON
HER SEASON, AND I FEEL REALLY
WEIRD RIGHT NOW.
I FEEL ALONE.
 I WAS LIKE, CALM DOWN.
 ABI GOES OFF TO THE BEACH.
THE EIGHT OF US ARE IN THE
SHELTER, AND SHE'S GETTING
LAUGHED AT BY HER PEOPLE.
AND NO ONE STOOD UP FOR HER.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S ANNOYING AND
SHE'S AN EMOTIONAL TRAIN WRECK,
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
OUT THERE FLOUNDERING, THAT'S
JUST WRONG.

 RIGHT NOW I'M KIND OF OPEN TO
OR WHOEVER IS GOING TO PROTECT
ME.
 SOMETHING STARTED TO REALLY
CLICK BETWEEN ME AND ABI, NOT
ONLY PERSONAL-WISE BECAUSE WE
MADE THAT CONNECTION, BUT
STRATEGIC-WISE IN THE TALKING WE
WERE DOING THERE.
 MAYBE IT'S THE OLD SCHOOL
THING, BUT IF WE MOVE ON
TOGETHER, I GOT YOUR BACK.
THE OPPORTUNITY SPRANG FROM JUST
BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT SOMEBODY.
 SITTING HERE BY MYSELF, ALL
ALONE, WHO CAME THE TALK TO ME?
YOU.
 JEFF LIT A LITTLE FIRE UNDER
MY ASS.
I KNEW I HAD TO COME TO THE
BEACH WITH SOCIAL GAME.
I WAS SLOW ON THE UPTAKE AT
FIRST, BUT IT'S STARTING TO COME
TOGETHER.
[WHISPERING]
 I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO
ANYWHERE.
I THINK YOU'RE FABULOUS.
 THAT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS
AFTER MY WHOLE ALLIANCE IS JUST
LETTING EVERYONE JUST MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE A FOOL.
AND NOW I FEEL SO GOOD THAT
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK
WITH ME.
AND THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIND ME,
YOU KNOW, A JOY.
 WE BOTH AGREE.
I'LL GET TERRY TO DO IT, KELLY
TO DO IT, ME AND YOU.
THAT'S FIVE.
AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO TURNED
THEIR BACK ON YOU...
 THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE...
 WE WILL HELP YOU.
 CAN WE SHAKE ON THAT?
 TERRY SAW THE CRACK, AND HE
JUMPED RIGHT ON IT.
MY OLD ALLIANCE WILL DEFINITELY
REGRET NOT COMING TO ME WHEN I
NEEDED THEM THE MOST.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
BAYON GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW TA KEO TRIBE.
VYTAS VOTED OUT AT THE FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 YEAH.
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
BOTH TRIBES WILL CAR RACE ACROSS
A SERIES OF A-FRAMES CARRYING A
ROPE.
YOU WILL USE THAT ROPE TO PULL A
HEAVY CRATE TO THE FINISH.
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS WILL THEN USE
THE PIECES INSIDE THAT CRATE TO
SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
FIRST TRIBE TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SECOND CHANCE."
IN ADDITION YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: IT IS A "SURVIVOR"
TOOLKIT, AND IT IS PRETTY
SWEET -- HAMMER, AXE, CHISEL,
SAW, BAMBOO AND ROPE.
PLUS WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP, MATERIALS THAT WILL VASTLY
IMPROVE YOUR SHELTER.
THIS SHOULD MAKE SLEEPING BETTER
AND PROTECT YOU FROM THE RAIN.
BIG REWARD.
[APPLAUSE]
BAYON, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER.
SITTING SOMEONE OUT.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
 CIERA.
 Jeff: ONE MORE THING.
I FORGOT TO GRAB THE IDOL.
CIERA.
SECOND CHANCE FOR ME TO GET THIS
RIGHT.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
CIERA TAKE A SPOT ON THE SIT-OUT
BENCH.
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL GET
STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
GOT TO GET UP OVER THAT FIRST
WALL.
 GO, GUYS!
GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.
HELP EACH OTHER.
 Jeff: BAYON FLYING OVER IT.
TA KEO TAKING MORE TIME.
THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK
WHEN YOU SKID DOWN THAT WOOD.
BAYON IN THE EARLY LEAD.
SECOND WALL, EVERYBODY, LET'S
GO.
 GO, GO.
 Jeff: THIS ONE'S GOING TO
TAKE SOME MORE WORK TO GET UP.
 HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.
 COME ON, COME ON!
 Jeff: HEAD TO THAT NEXT
ONE, BUT YOU GOT TO WAIT ON
EVERYBODY.
A LOT OF SKIDS COMING UP.
VARNER TAKES A BIG FALL.
GO, BAYON!
GO, TA KEO!
THIS WILL BE THE TOUGHEST WALL
YET.
IT WILL REQUIRE A LOT OF
TEAMWORK.
USE THAT ROPE IF YOU NEED IT.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SKIN
LEFT ON THIS WOOD.
THIS IS WHY YOU ARE OUT HERE,
FOR YOUR SECOND CHANCE AT THIS
GAME.
LOSING MORE SKIN.
DEFINITELY SOME INJURIES AND
SOME VERY HARD FALLS.
HUGE FALL.
JOE, GO.
FOUR PEOPLE ON THE CRATE.
FOUR PEOPLE ON THE CRATE.
THE OTHER FIVE TO THE MAT.
YOU GOT TO TIE THESE ROPES
TOGETHER.
YOU'LL USE THE ROPES TO PULL THE
CRATE.
WE'RE VERY EVEN RIGHT NOW.
HERE WE GO.
BOTH SIDES PULLING NOW.
DIG!
 PULL!
PULL!
PULL!
 Jeff: THAT CRATE IS VERY
HEAVY.
SPENCER, DIETZ AND VARNER ARE
STUCK.
BAYON IS BACK.
TWO PUZZLE MAKERS.
EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE MATT.
 THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
COME ON, GUYS.
 Jeff: TA KEO HAS A LOT OF
TIME THE MAKE UP.
IT IS KASS AND KIMMI WORKING THE
PUZZLE FOR BAYON.
THERE IT IS, GO.
BIG LEAD FOR KIMMI AND KASS.
ARE THEY ON THE RIGHT TRACK, IS
THE QUESTION?
WHEN YOUR PUZZLE IS RIGHT, EVERY
PIECE WILL CONNECT TO THE NEXT
ONE.
 THAT'S PERFECT.
KELLEY WHEN WORTH AND PEIH-GEE
GOING TO START WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLE.
CAN THEY MAKE UP THE LOST TIME?
IMMUNITY AND A BIG REWARD ON THE
LINE.
 GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: SPENCER TRYING TO
COME IN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
CAN HE PICK UP THE PACE?
CAN HE CLOSE THE GAP?
 WE GOT IT.
 Jeff: TOO MUCH COMMUNICATE
CANNING CAUSE CHAOS AND
CONFUSION.
EVERYBODY ON TA KEO IS YELLING
AT SPENCER AND PEIH-GEE.
JOE GOING TO COME IN NOW FOR
KIMMI.
HE THINKS HE KNOWS WHAT NEEDS TO
HELP.
JEREMY IS COMING IN FOR KASS.
HE'S HAD TIME THE STUDY IT.
 DO YOU WANT ME TO COME IN?
 IT'S NOW SHIRIN AND SPENCER.
SHIRIN TAKING OVER, MOVING
PIECES AROUND.
 NO, YOU CAN'T.
STOP IT.
 OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T.
 Jeff: PANIC STARTING TO SET
IN.
 GOD, THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
 Jeff: THIS PUZZLE ONLY GOES
TOGETHER CORRECTLY IN ONE WAY,
AND WHEN YOU DO, EVERYTHING
LINES UP.
THE DESIGN WILL FLOW FROM ONE
PIECE TO THE NEXT.
IF IT DOESN'T FLOW, IT'S WRONG.
 YES!
SPENCER NOW STARTING TO MAKE
SOME PROGRESS WITH SOMETHING
NEW.
IS HE RIGHT?
 THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: SPENCER AND SHIRIN
CONTINUE THE MAKE CHANGES.
 YES, YES, YES!
YES, SPENCER, YES!
 Jeff: THIS WOULD BE A
MASSIVE COME-FROM-BEHIND VICTORY
FOR TA KEO.
JOE NOW MOVING PIECES.
HE HAS AN IDEA WHERE HE WANTS TO
GO WITH IT.
BOTH TRIBES MOVING PIECES VERY
QUICKLY TRYING TO GET TO THE
FINISH.
THE QUESTION IS ARE EITHER OF
THEM RIGHT THIS TIME?
 HE'S STILL HERE.
HE'S STILL HERE.
 Jeff: IT IS A RACE TO THE
FINISH.
 PUT THAT THERE.
PUT THAT THERE.
 YOU GOT IT.
YOU GOT IT.
 YES, YES!
[CHEERING].
 Jeff: TA KEO THINKS THEY
HAVE IT.
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
BAYON THINKS THEY HAVE IT.
BAYON IS RIGHT!
IMMUNITY AND REWARD FOR BAYON
SENDING TA KEO BACK THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 BYRON BAYON!
 BAYON!
 Jeff: BAYON,
CONGRATULATIONS.
IMMUNITY AGAIN.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,
BAYON.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THIS
TRIBE.
IN ADDITION, PRETTY DECENT
REWARD.
COME GRAB IT.
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Anchor: TA KEO, ALL I HAVE
IS A DATE WITH YOU TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL WHERE SOMEONE WILL BE THE
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SECOND CHANCE."
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 THAT CHALLENGE WAS A TRIAL.
BUT SPENCER AND SHIRIN HAD THEIR
FATE IN THEIR OWN HANDS.
ONE OF THOSE TWO IS GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
HOW POETIC.
 GOOD EFFORT, YOU GUYS.
 GRUELING.
GRUELING.
 YOU DID GOOD.
 NO WORRIES.
TOUGH BREAK.
 EVERYBODY DID THEIR PART.
 SECOND CHALLENGE IN AND WE'RE
ALREADY GETTING OUR ASSES
KICKED.
I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE CONTROL
OF THE GAME WITH SHIRIN.
I RELATE TO SHIRIN MORE THAN
ANYONE ELSE OUT HERE.
MY OLD "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE OF
BEING ON THE BOTTOM AND
SUFFERING AND NOT HAVING ANYONE
I CAN PLAY WITH AND TRUST IS
GONE.
 HAVE YOU DONE A SCRUB?
 DO IT.
 I'LL LET YOU SCRUB ME.
 I'LL SCRUB YOU IF YOU WANT.
 MY WHOLE THING IS GET RID OF
THE THREATS AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
SPENCER IS A HUGE STRATEGIC
THREAT.
THAT KID IS THE SMARTEST YOUNG
MAN I'VE EVER MET IN MY ENTIRE
LIFE.
SHIRIN IS ALL OF THAT, PLUS
SHE'S EMOTIONAL.
SHE KNOWS HOW TO TALK TO YOU
LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND.
SHE'S A SALESPERSON.
THEY ARE TWO HEADS ON ONE SNAKE,
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE
WE CHOP OFF.
WOULD YOU VOTE SHIRIN OR
SPENCER?
 YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO
GO WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE.
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO VOTE
OUT ABI, BUT CURRENTLY I'M
SIDING WITH THE LARGER MAJORITY,
WHICH SEEMS TO BE EVERYONE
EXCEPT FOR SHIRIN AND SPENCER.
I THINK THEY'RE BOTH A LITTLE
BIT DANGEROUS, AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
VOTE.
 I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, THIS
TRIBE...
 WE'RE A MESS.
 WE ARE A MESS.
OH, ABI'S DEVASTATED THAT SHIRIN
DIDN'T STAND UP FOR HER LAST
NIGHT.
 I KNOW.
 TERRY DIETZ SAT UP WITH HER
ALL NIGHT LONG LIKE HER FATHER,
SO SHE WOKE UP COMPLETELY LOYAL.
 WHO IS GOOD RIGHT NOW, YOU,
PEIH-GEE, WOO...
 EVERYBODY BUT SHIRIN AND
SPENCER.
IT'S OVER.
IF YOU'RE ON BOARD...
 I AM.
OKAY, VARNER, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SEE ME TALKING TO HER TODAY.
I PROMISE YOU.
 IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO
THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR SHIRIN OR
SPENCER BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY
ORIGINAL ALLIES.
UNFORTUNATELY THINGS SHIFTED
OVER THE COURSE OF 24 HOURS, AND
NOW I FIND MYSELF IN A DIFFERENT
ALLIANCE, WHICH I DON'T
NECESSARILY LIKE, BUT I HAVE TO
GO WITH THE FLOW.
SO SHIRIN AND SPENCER ARE IN
DEEP CRAP.
 EVEN THOUGH WE LOST THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, I FEEL
REALLY GREAT GOING FORWARD
BECAUSE WE HAVE ME, SPENCER,
KELLY, JEFF VARNER, BUT, YOU
KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
ABI STILL FEELS GOOD.
SHE IS ALWAYS ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?
 I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL GOOD TODAY.
 I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T STAND UP FOR
YOU.
 I WISH YOU HAD BECAUSE I'M A
LOYAL PERSON, AND WHEN I GIVE MY
WORD TO AN ALLIANCE, IT'S 100%.
I WAS EXPECTING ONE OF YOU GUYS
TO AT LEAST COME AND CHECK ON
ME.
WHO CAME?
TERRY.
TERRY CAME.
HE SPENT TWO HOURS WITH ME, TWO
HOURS.
I'M SO SORRY.
I TRIED, SHIRIN.
I TRIED.
I TRIED HAVING YOUR BACK, BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT, WITH ME YOU'RE
DEAD.
YOU GUYS LEFT ME THERE ALL BY
MYSELF.
 ABI, I GAVE YOU MY WORD.
I VOTED WITH YOU?
WHAT MORE CAN I DO.
 I WAS CRYING IN FRONT OF YOU.
I WAS MADE A FOOL OF.
OKAY.
THIS IS REALLY AWKWARD.
 VARNER IS ON BOARD.
KELLY IS ON BOARD.
 THEY WANT TO VOTE YOU AND
SPENCER OUT.
 ARE WE STILL IN THIS
TOGETHER?
 NOT MY STYLE.
 SPENCER AND I WERE IN THE
MAJORITY THAT VOTED OUT VYTAS.
WE SHOULD BE RIDING HIGH, HAPPY,
BUT SOMEHOW SOME WAY WE'VE ENDED
UP IN THE MINORITY.
WE'RE SCREWED.
 OKAY.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN...
 LOOK, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
TIME TO MINCE WORDS HERE.
VARNER AND ABI ARE GOING TO VOTE
WITH OLD SCHOOL.
 RIGHT NOW I'M SWINGING LIKE A
PENDULUM BETWEEN FRUSTRATION AND
EXASPERATION.
ONE MINUTE AGO I WAS IN A
PERFECTLY FINE POSITION, AND NOW
NOTHING IS NEARLY AS HIGH A
PRIORITY AS KEEPING MYSELF SAFE.
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT A
PRIORITY TO MAKE IT THREE MORE
DAYS.
 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, IF
IT'S ALL OLD SCHOOL, YOU,
THEY'LL KEEP YOU AROUND FOR
CHALLENGES FOR NOW, BUT YOU WILL
BE AT THE BOTTOM, AND IF YOU'RE
LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE MERGE,
YOU WILL BE THE BIGGEST THREAT
AND YOU WILL BE PICKED OFF AS
SOON AS YOU DON'T WIN IMMUNITY.
 ALL OF A SUDDEN SPENCER AND
SHIRIN HAVE THE AUDACITY TO
THINK, YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M GOING
TO DROP MY TRIBE, JUMP IN WITH
THEM.
HEY, I'M SORRY, MAJORITY RULES.
LIKE I'M IN THE SAYING I DON'T
TRUST YOU...
 YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
 THIS IS THE FIRST
CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING WITH
ME.
YOU'RE THROWING A LOT AT ME.
 I NEVER BREAK MY WORD.
I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH ABOUT
THE FACT THAT I VERY, VERY WELL
MAY GO HOME.
THE ONLY OPTION I HAVE IS VOTING
FOR SPENCER.
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR
SPENCER.
I WILL MAKE YOU ANY DEAL YOU
WANT RIGHT NOW.
 IT BOGGLES MY MIND THAT NOT
ONE TIME DID YOU EVER PULL ME
ASIDE.
NOW YOU COME TO ME ASKING ME FOR
A VOTE.
I'M JUST KIND OF SITTING BACK
LIKE, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
MY SITUATION IS GETTING WEAKER
AND BLEECKER.
THIS WAS GOING TO BE MY SECOND
CHANCE.
I WANTED TO HAVE A VERY
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, BUT I'M
BEING BROUGHT HARD BACK TO MY
FIRST EXPERIENCE WHERE
EVERYTHING STARTS GOING REALLY
WELL AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT
COLLAPSES IN FRONT OF ME.
EVERY SINGLE PERSON OTHER THAN
SHIRIN AND I IS IN THE NUMBERS
AGAINST US.
I MEAN, SHIRIN'S BEEN MY ONLY
SOLID PERSON, AND NOW I FEEL
LIKE THERE'S NO MOVE I CAN MAKE
OTHER THAN SCREWING OVER THE ONE
PERSON I WANTED TO PLAY WITH.
 Jeff: SO, VARNER, WHAT IS
THE VIBE OF THE TRIBE RIGHT NOW?
 I THINK WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED.
I THINK TODAY REALLY SUCKED A
LOT OUT OF US.
THAT WAS AN INTENSE CHALLENGE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, IT'S ONE
THING TO WANT THE PLAY AGAIN,
BUT THEN YOU GET OUT HERE AND
YOU'RE REMINDED, OH, YEAH, THIS
IS AN ASS-KICKER.
 YEAH, I THINK WE DEAL WITH
SOME KIND OF AMNESIA FOR HOWEVER
MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN SINCE WE
PLAYED THE FIRST TIME.
THEN WE GET BACK HERE AND IT'S
LIKE, OH, THIS SUCKS.
IT'S GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, IT'S
INTERESTING WHAT SPENCER JUST
SAID.
YOU REMEMBER "SURVIVOR" BEING
AWESOME UNTIL YOU GET BACK OUT
HERE.
 I DON'T REMEMBER IT AS BEING
AWESOME.
I HAD A REALLY ROUGH TIME FIRST
TIME AROUND, AND I'M STARTING TO
HAVE A ROUGH TIME THE SECOND
TIME AROUND.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH, ALREADY.
 Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
 THERE WAS SOME FIGHTING AND
SOME PEOPLE HAVE LOST SOME TRUST
IN ME.
I THINK I'M ON THE BOTTOM.
I HOPE I CAN FIGHT MY WAY BACK
INTO THE GAME.
 Jeff: KELLEY, WHAT IS
SHIRIN REFERRING TO?
 THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN ABI AND PEIH-GEE, AND I
THINK THAT'S WHAT SHIRIN IS
TALKING ABOUT.
 Jeff: ABI, WHAT WAS IT
ABOUT?
 I WAS SITTING AT THE BEACH
AND PEIH-GEE AND SHIRIN WERE
TALKING ABOUT ME.
I FELT BETRAYED IN A WAY BECAUSE
WE WERE ALL IN AN ALLIANCE.
AND I AM VERY, VERY GRACIOUS
TOWARD TERRY.
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT RESCUED
ME WHEN I WAS FEELING VERY
LONELY, WHEN I FELT THAT I WAS
GOING TO BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT
UNANIMOUSLY.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, THAT'S ALMOST
VERBATIM WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR
SEASON.
YOU SAID IT ABOUT MIKE, THAT HE
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO RESCUED ME.
ABI SAID IT ABOUT TERRY, BUT IN
THIS CASE, SHE WAS UPSET WITH
YOU.
 I AGREE THAT I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE FOR HER.
I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HER RIGHT
AWAY AND FIXED IT.
I DIDN'T.
AND THE GAME CHANGES VERY
QUICKLY.
 Jeff: DIETZ, YOU'RE NODDING
YOUR HEAD.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS
ON THE BOTTOM A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
AND BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THE
OTHER NIGHT, IT ENDED UP WITH
ABI SITTING ON THE BEACH, AND
SHE AND I JUST MADE A
CONNECTION.
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THIS
HARD-CORE STRATEGY THING.
IT WAS JUST ABOUT BUILDING A
RELATIONSHIP, AND A LOT OF GOOD
THINGS CAME OUT OF IT.
 Jeff: TO THE POINT WHERE I
DON'T THINK I'M ON THE BOTTOM
ANYMORE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, SHIRIN SAYS
SHE FEELS SO ON THE BOTTOM.
IS THAT A CONSENSUS THAT SHE
MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE?
 YEAH.
I MEAN, I DON'T SEE ANY REASON
TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, BUT I
AM ALSO CONCERNED.
 Jeff: WHY WOULD YOU BE A
TARGET TONIGHT?
 THERE ARE A LOT OF REASON,
BUT ONE IS TALKING TOO MUCH
ABOUT STRATEGY AND TOO LITTLE
ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW ALL OF
THESE PEOPLE.
 Jeff: JEFF, ARE SHIRIN AND
SPENCER RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED?
HAVE YOU GUYS NARROWED IT DOWN
TO ONE OF THOSE TWO GOING?
 YES.
 Jeff: SPENCER, THAT
CONFIRMS THAT.
 100%.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON
TO SPEAK ABOUT IT IN CODE.
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF US GOING
HOME, BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
WIGLESWORTH, TERRY, PEIH-GEE,
JEFF, ABI, WOO AND KELLY, IF I
AM HERE TOMORROW, THIS CHANGE
WILL HAPPEN.
IT'S NOT ABOUT FORMING AN
ALLIANCE HERE, I'M FORMING AN
ALLIANCE HERE, IT'S ABOUT
CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE.
IT'S ABOUT FORMING RELATIONSHIPS
THAT HAVE A BASIS, AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M HERE TO DO FROM HERE ON
OUT, AND I MEAN THAT.
 Jeff: IT IS AMAZING, THE
TWO PEOPLE IN TROUBLE TONIGHT,
SHIRIN AND SPENCER, ARE HAVING
VERY SIMILAR STORIES TO THE
FIRST TIME YOU BOTH PLAYED.
SPENCER, THAT WAS ALMOST THE
SPEECH YOU GAVE YOUR SEASON.
I'LL JUST WORK WITH ANYBODY WHO
WILL GIVE WITH ME, JUST GIVE ME
A CHANCE.
AND SHIRIN YOU WERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT
BEING EXCLUDED ON ONE SIDE OR
THE OTHER.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT,
SHIRIN?
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT SECOND
CHANCES AND THE ABILITY TO
CHANGE OR THE SITUATION THAT WE
END UP PUTTING OURSELVES IN TIME
AFTER TIME AFTER TIME?
 CHANGE IS HARD.
THIS IS A SECOND CHANCE TO BE
ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT IT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO
CHANGE OVERNIGHT.
I MADE SOME VERY CLEAR MISTAKES.
SO IF I GO HOME TONIGHT, THAT'S
ON ME.
I DID THAT.
IF I DON'T GO HOME TONIGHT, IF I
STAY, THAT'S A THIRD CHANCE.
THAT'S ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
WIGLESWORTH, YOU'RE UP.
 I KNOW YOU'RE WRITING MY NAME
DOWN, TOO.
I DON'T HAVE A BAD THING TO SAY
ABOUT YOU.
 Anchor: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, SPENCER.
SHIRIN.
SHIRIN.
SHIRIN.
THREE VOTES SHIRIN.
SPENCER.
SPENCER.
THAT'S THREE VOTES SPENCER,
THREE VOTES SHIRIN.
SPENCER.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES SPENCER, THREE
VOTES SHIRIN.
SHIRIN.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
FOUR VOTES SHIRIN, FOUR VOTES
SPENCER, ONE VOTE LEFT.
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE,"
SHIRIN.
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 WOW.
 Anchor: SHIRIN, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
 I MEANT EVERY WORD I SAID.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
 Jeff: WELL, THIS SEASON
OFFERS A SECOND CHANCE TO CHANGE
WHAT DIDN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME.
BUT IF YOU DON'T CHANGE, HISTORY
IS DESTINED TO REPEAT ITSELF.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," IN A SEASON WHERE
ADAPTING IS EVERYTHING...
 BEING SOMEONE WHO WILL NOT
CHANGE IS THE DEATH OF YOU.
 Jeff: EVERYONE BETTER BE
READY TO CHANGE.
DROP YOUR BUFFS.
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.
FOR TWO TRIBES TO THREE TRIBES.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I FEEL LIKE I REALLY DIDN'T
GET TO SEIZE MY SECOND CHANCE.
I STRUGGLE TO CHANGE IN A LOT OF
KEY WAYS TO MAKE THIS GAME WORK
FOR ME.
I WAS IN A TOTAL FINE POSITION
AND WENT CRAZY AND BLEW UP MY
GAME.
I HAD AN AWESOME OPENING ACT AND
THEN KILLED MYSELF.
