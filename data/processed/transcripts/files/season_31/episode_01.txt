 --- 

         Jeff: "SURVIVOR" IS THE
MOST PHYSICALLY DEMANDING AND
EMOTIONALLY TAXING GAME ON
TELEVISION.
IT STRIPS YOU TO YOUR CORE.
 OH!
 Jeff: YOU'RE PULLING
YOURSELF OUT OF THE GAME?
WHILE OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO PROVE WHAT YOU'RE
MADE OF.








FOR THOSE WHO WIN-- WINNER OF
"SURVIVOR: CAGAYAN."
THE REWARD IS GRAND-- A MILLION
DOLLARS AND A HIGH THAT MAY
NEVER BE REPEATED.
BUT FOR THOSE WHO LOSE-- DID WOO
MAKE A MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE--
THE CONSEQUENCE IS OFTEN A
RELENTLESS NIGHTMARE OF WHAT-IFS
THAT NEVER ENDS.
UNTIL NOW.
I AM SO HAPPY TO SAY KELLY
WIGLESWORTH, YOU WILL GET A
SECOND SHOT.








GET UP ON THAT STAGE!
THIS SEASON, FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER, WE TURNED "SURVIVOR" OVER
TO THE FANS.
20 FORMER PLAYERS WHO HAVE
PLAYED ONLY ONCE WERE SELECTED
BY A NATIONWIDE AUDIENCE VOTE.
THEY'RE BEING GIVEN A SECOND
CHANCE TO FINISH WHAT THEY
STARTED.
 YES!
 Jeff: SOME HAVE WAITED OVER
A DECADE.
 Jeff: THEY'VE TRAVELED TO
CAMBODIA, A COUNTRY WITH THE OWN
STUNNING, HUMBLING, AND POWERFUL
HISTORY THAT STIRS THE EMOTIONS.
IT SERVES AS A VIVID REMINDER OF
HOW THE PAST CAN HAUNT AND
PROVIDES THE INSPIRATION TO
SEIZE THEIR SECOND CHANCE.
 15 YEARS AGO, I WAS IN
BORNEO, FIRST SEASON, AND I
ALMOST WON.
 Jeff: THE WINNER OF THE
FIRST "SURVIVOR" COMPETITION,
RICH.
 I MADE IT 39 DAYS, AND LOST
BY ONE VOTE.
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
IT'S BEEN POKING AT ME FOR 15
YEARS LITTLE BY LITTLE.
I'M MUCH STRONGER AND SMARTER,
AND I'M A MOM NOW.
I'VE GIVEN BIRTH, OKAY.
I CAN DO ANYTHING AT THIS POINT,
RIGHT?
 I AM LIVING THE DREAM.
I HAVE THE PERFECT WIFE.
MY KID, THEY'RE AMAZING.
I'VE GOT A GREAT JOB.
I DON'T HAVE ANY BAD THINGS IN
MY LIFE, EXCEPT "PEARL ISLANDS."
 Jeff: ANDREW.
 MY EXIT, IT'S HAUNTED ME FOR
12 YEARS, AND I'M NOT OVER IT,
AND TO CURE MY "SURVIVOR" PAIN,
I NEED TO GIVE IT 1,000%.
I'M GOING TO LEAVE EVERYTHING
I'VE GOT IN THIS GAME, AND IT
WILL BE EPIC.
 LAST TIME I PLAYED "SURVIVOR"
I WAS, FRANKLY, COCKY.
KASS, ZERO CHANCE OF WINNING THE
GAME.
I THOUGHT ABOUT "SURVIVOR" IN
TERMS OF CHESS, BUT I HAVE DONE
A LOT OF MATURING.
I'VE BEEN EMOTIONAL GROWING IN
THAT TIME.
PEOPLE ARE NOT CHESS PIECES AND
THEY NEED TO BE RELATED TO ON A
HUMAN LEVEL.
BEING MORE EMOTIONALLY AWARE, I
THINK I'M IN A BETTER PLACE IN
LIFE THAT I'VE EVER BEEN TO PLAY
AND WIN THIS GAME.
 MY EXPERIENCE IN AUSTRALIA
WAS CUT WAY SHORT, AND I WANT TO
HAVE THAT SECOND CHANCE AT MY
DREAM OF GETTING TO THE END.
THE ANGKOR WAT TEMPLES, THAT'S A
TOTAL METAPHOR FOR THIS WHOLE
GAME BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU GET
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN BUILD YOURSELF UP.
14 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO
FINISH THAT LAST CHAPTER IN THE
BOOK.
 THE LAST TIME I PLAYED THE
GAME I WAS WITH MY DAD.
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS
LIKE--
 NO, I KNOW.
 LIKE AGGRESSIVE AND YOU'RE
SAYING WHAT TO DO.
PLAYING WITH MY DAD WAS MY
DOWNFALL ABSOLUTELY.
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN
MY DAD'S NAME DOWN BUT I CAN'T
GO BACK ON THAT NOW.
I CAN TAKE THIS SECOND CHANCE,
AND I CAN MAKE THE MOVES THAT I
WANTED TO MAKE AND HAVE A BETTER
GAME.
 I REALLY MESSED UP MY FIRST
TIME BEING SCARED EARLY ON.
AFTER DISCOVERING THAT, LIKE, I
CAN SOCIALLY WORK MY WAY THROUGH
THIS GAME, I STARTED TO SAY,
"OKAY, CIERA, LET'S START MAKING
SOME MOVES."
 Jeff: 11th PERSON VOTED
OUT OF "SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS.
WATER."
 UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD TO START
WITH VOTING MY MOM OUT.
 I LOVE YOU.
 AND THIS TIME I WANT TO BE
FEARLESS AND I WANT TO BE THAT
PERSON I WAS AT THE END OF THE
GAME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
GAME AND JUST LEAVE IT ALL OUT
ON THE ISLAND.
 THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR," I WAS NICE TASHA.
THIS IS, LIKE, THE LEAST
STRATEGIC GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED.
IT'S REALLY SILLY.
I DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY OR MY
CHURCH MEMBERS TO BE
DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY I PLAYED
THE GAME.
WHEN I RETURNED HOME, MY CHURCH
MEMBERS WERE SAYING, "YOU NEED
TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE.
YOU NEED TO LIE AND BACKSTAB
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE."
SO IF THE SAINT THINK IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HERE TO WIN A MILLION
DOLLARS, AND WHEN IT'S ALL DONE,
I'LL PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS.
 THIS SECOND CHANCE MEANS
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO ME.
I JUMPED OFF A POLE IN THE
OUTBACK FOR PEANUT BUTTER AND
GAVE AWAY A MILLION DOLLARS WHEN
I DID IT.
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER.
 Jeff: ANYBODY DECIDES TO
BAIL, YOU CAN JOIN ME.
 TO REPLAY THAT HISTORY OVER
AND OVER FOR 14 YEARS REALLY
DOES A NUMBER ON YOU.
 Jeff: JEFF, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO
REWRITE MY OWN STORY.
I'M MORE MATURE.
I'M A LOT SMARTER, AND I'M NOT
JUMPING OFF ANYTHING FOR PEANUT
BUTTER.
 GROWING UP AS A KID, ME AND
MY DAD WOULD SIT AROUND AND
WATCH "SURVIVOR."
IT WAS REALLY HARD NOT GETTING
MY DAD OUT HERE FOR THE LOVED
ONES' VISIT.
IT WAS SOMETHING THEY REALLY
WANTED TO DO TO PROVE TO MYSELF
THAT I COULD MAKE IT THAT FAR IN
THE GAME.
 Jeff: JOE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 THANKS, JEFF.
I JUST CAME UP SHORT, AND IT WAS
DEVASTATING.
I THINK THIS IS MY TIME TO MAKE
IT HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.
 WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE DEVIL IN
US.
I WAS A BIT OF A TROUBLEMAKER MY
SEASON.
 GOOD LUCK.
 CHAOS KASS, WELL, SHE LIVES
SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN ME.
BUT IF DON'T CHANGE, SOMEONE'S
GOING TO TAKE ME DOWN.
BUT I KIND OF LIKE MY LEGACY
THUS FAR.
I LIKE THE CHAOS.
THE THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS TO
CHANGE IS THEIR PERCEPTION OF
ME, AND THEN WHEN THE MERGE
COMES, IF I'M THERE, ALL HELL
UPON BREAK LOOSE.
 YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK BACK ON
MY SEASON, I MADE A LOT OF
MISTAKES.
I CREATED A LOT OF TROUBLE.
I AM YOUR FRIEND.
BUT IF YOU ( BLEEP ) WITH ME,
YOU'RE DEAD.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I THREW COKE NUTS AT SCOOPIN'S
HEAD.
 OW!
GOD.
 SORRY.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I WAS TOO BLUNT WITH LISA.
SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU INSULTING MY
INTELLIGENCE RIGHT NOW?
YOU'RE TRYING TO FREAKING FOOL
ME?
I'M NOT STUPID.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
BUT HAVING A SECOND CHANCE TO
COME BACK AND PATCH THOSE LITTLE
MISTAKES.
BUT I LIKE HAVING FUN.
VILLAINS HAVE MORE FUN.
 THE LAST TIME WHEN I PLAYED
WITH MY WIFE, HALF MY MIND WAS
ALWAYS WITH HER.
 Jeff: THEY'RE SENDING YOUR
WIFE TO EXILE ISLAND.
WHAT'S THE FEELING RIGHT NOW?
 I GOT NOTHING.
IT'S EMOTIONAL, YOU KNOW, WITH
VAL.
I REALLY LOVE HER, AND I CARE
ABOUT WHAT SHE'S DOING.
I WASN'T FOCUSED.
 Jeff: EIGHTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE SECOND MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
 SO I WAS BLINDSIDED BY MY OWN
ALLIANCE.
I WENT HOME, TOOK IT HARD.
NOW, I WANT THE MONEY FOR VAL
MORE THAN FOR ME.
I JUST NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS
AGAIN.
I'M BACK FOR SOME REDEMPTION.
 Jeff: WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR
CAMBODIA: SECOND CHANCE."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE SEASON
BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL RETURNING
PLAYERS WHO HAVE PLAYED ONLY
ONCE AND DIDN'T WIN, WHICH IS
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING YOU FAILED
IN YOUR GOAL.
AND YOU'RE BEING GIVEN A SECOND
CHANCE TO FINISH WHAT YOU
STARTED.
TO FURTHER FUEL YOUR MOTIVATION,
YOU WERE CHOSEN, VOTED IN BY THE
VERY PEOPLE WHO WATCHED YOU PLAY
THE FIRST TIME, OUR AUDIENCE.
CIERA, WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE
TO KNOW WE DIDN'T PUT OUT SHOW.
THE FANS PUT YOU ON THE SHOW?
 I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY
LIKE AN ELEMENT OF PRESSURE
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LET,
YOU KNOW, YOUR FAMILY DOWN LET
ALONE NOW, AMERICA.
 Jeff: JEFF VARNER, YOU CAN
ARGUE THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE
FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
IT WAS 14 YEARS AGO.
 A LONG TIME AGO.
 Jeff: HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THIS AGAIN?
 A LOT.
A WHOLE LOT.
 Jeff: I CAN EVEN FEEL OR
HEAR THE BUTTERFLIES COMING
THROUGH YOUR VOICE.
 A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
THERE'S EXCITEMENT.
THERE ARE BUTTERFLIES.
THERE'S EMOTION.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT GOING
ON.
 Jeff: JOE, YOU PLAYED IN
OUR MOST RECENT SEASON.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THIS IS REALLY LIKE
GETTING HOME, TAKING A SHOWER,
AND COMING BACK OUT AGAIN.
 YEAH, THE TRANSITION WAS
PRETTY QUICK.
BUT I'M NOW WITH ALL THE GREAT
PLAYERS THEY GREW UP WATCHING,
PEOPLE THAT I KIND OF BASED MY
GAME AFTER.
SOME OF THESE GREAT PLAYERS, I
MEAN, TERRY, THE CHALLENGE
BEAST.
I WAS LIKE MAN, I WOULD LOVE TO
DO THAT.
THEY PAVED THE WAY FOR THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: AND WE HAVE TO CHECK
IN WITH KELLY WIGLESWORTH.
 RIGHT HERE, JEFF.
 Jeff: THE FIRST RUNNERUP OF
OUR VERY FIRST SEASON 15 YEARS
AGO.
 IT'S WEIRD WHEN I HEAR JOE
SAY, "I GREW UP WATCHING
"SURVIVOR."
 WE'RE OLD, MAN.
 Jeff: ONE VOTE,
WIGLESWORTH, IT WAS ONE VOTE.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THAT RICHARD HATCH
BEAT YOU BY.
HOW OFTEN DO YOU REPLAY FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL?
 EVERY DAY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, 20 PLAYERS
FROM 30 SEASONS, ALL WITH ONE
THING IN COMMON-- YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOUR SECOND CHANCE.
YOUR SECOND CHANCE IS HERE.
LET'S GET GOING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
INSIDE YOUR BOAT, YOU'LL FIND A
BAG OF BUFFS, ALONG WITH A MAP
TO YOUR NEW TRIBE BEACH.
TWO BOATS ON THE LEFT, WE HAVE
WIGLESWORTH, WOO, SHIRIN, VYTAS,
ABI, DEITZ, JEFF VARNER,
SPENCER, AND KELLEY WENTWORTH.
YOUR TRIBE NAME TAKEO.
TWO BOAT ON THE RIGHT, CIERA,
TASH AFISHBACK, SAVAGE, JEREMY,
MONICA, KASS, JOE, KEITH, AND
KIMMI.
YOUR TRIBE NAME IS BAYON.
BOTH TRIBES NAMED AFTER FAMOUS
TEMPLES OF ANGKOR WAT.
THIS BOAT, SUPPLIES THAT WILL
MAKE
YOUR LIFE BACK AT CAMP A WHOLE
LOT EASIER.
ON MY GO, YOU WILL GET OFF OF
YOUR BOAT, RACE ON THIS BOAT AND
GATHER AS MANY SUPPLIES AS YOU
CAN.
THERE'S A TWIST-- 100 YARDS FROM
THE BOAT I AM ON IS ANOTHER
BOAT.
HANGING ON THAT BOAT ONE LARGE
BAG OF RICE.
THE FIRST PERSON WHO RETRIEVES
THE BAG WINS FOR THEIR TRIBE.
SO YOUR DILEMMA BECOMES HOW MUCH
TIME DO YOU SPEND ON THIS BOAT
GATHERING THE SUPPLIES YOU NEED
TO MAKE A CAMP, AND WHEN DO YOU
GET OFF, RELEASE YOUR RAFT, AND
START RACING FOR THE RICE?
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY YOUR FIRST
CHALLENGE AS NEW TRIBES.
AND IT GWYNNS NOW.
YOU GOT TO GET ON THIS BOAT AND
START GATHERING SUPPLIES QUICKLY
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE TAKES
EVERYTHING.
NOTHING EASY ABOUT "SURVIVOR."
SPENCE SER UP FIRST.
HERE'S JOE.
LET'S GO, KEEP MOVING!
CLIMB YOUR WAY UP!
20 PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH
AS YOU CAN, 15 YEARS FOR SOME OF
YOU, ALL THIS ENERGY HAS BEEN
PENT UP, FINALLY BEING RELEASED.
THIS IS IT, YOUR SECOND CHANCE
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
PEOPLE UP TOP, PEOPLE DOWN
BELOW, EVERYBODY WORKING
TOGETHER.
 STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
DROP IT.
HERE.
 Jeff: AT SOME POINT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO RELEASE YOUR
RAFT AND START FOR THAT RICE.
IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN.
THERE ARE POTS, THERE ARE PANS.
WATCH YOUR HEADS.
STUFF FLYING EVERYWHERE.
VARNER WITH A BIG LOAD COMING
DOWN.
WHAT IS VALUABLE AND WHAT IS
NOT?
 WE'RE ABOUT LOAD DOWN.
 WE GOTTA GO.
 Jeff: TAKEO IT HEADING OUT.
BAYON IS GETTING READY TO HEAD
OUT.
ONCE YOU'RE READY, RELEASE YOUR
RAFT.
USE THAT MACHETE TO CHOP THE
ROPE.
TAKEO IS ON THEIR BOAT.
VARNER RELEASING.
TAKEO IS RELEASED.
BAYON IS ON THEIR BOAT.
JOE IS CHOPPING.
YOU'RE GOOD, GET IN!
LET'S GO!
IT IS NOW A RACE TO THE RICE.
WHICH TRIBE WILL WORK TOGETHER
THE BEST STRAIGHT OUT OF THE
GATE?
15 YEARS AGO, IT WAS WIGLESWORTH
WHO WAS THE RIVER GUIDE.
THIS TIME SHE IS SWIMMING AHEAD
OF THE RAFT.
TAKEO OUT TO THE EARLY LEAD.
BAYON HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE,
NEARLY SINKING THEIR RAFT.
 CAN SOMEONE SWIM IT?
 YEP.
 KEEP GOING.
GET ME CLOSE.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH STILL
OUTSWIMMING THE RAFT.
 SHE'S GOING TO WEAR OUT.
 STROKE!
STROKE!
 I'M GOING FOR IT.
 GOOD LUCK.
 YEAH, JOE!
 Jeff: JOE NOW IN THE WATER
FOR BAYON.
HE'S MAKING A MOVE TRYING TO
CATCH WIGLESWORTH.
WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE NOW!
WOO NOW IN THE WATER FOR TACK
TAKEO.
 GO, WOO, GO.

 Jeff: HE'S PASSING
WIGLESWORTH.
JOE TRYING TO CATCH WOO.
IT IS GOING TO BE WOO TO THE
BOAT FIRST.
 WHOOO!
 Jeff: WOO HAS THE RICE FOR
TAKEO.
HEAD OUT TO YOUR BEACHES.
SECOND CHANCE IS ON.
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE, ONE
SURVIVOR.
 SPOTTING OUR FLAG, I WANTED
TO CRY I WAS SO STOKED.
IT WAS LIKE WHEN I FIRST
RECEIVED MY FIRST BLACK BELT,
IT'S SUPER HONORABLE.
( CHEERS )
 OH, MAN.
AWESOME!
GOOD JOB.
 HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 GOING INTO THIS SECOND
CHANCE, I'M NOT ONLY PLAYING FOR
MYSELF.
I FEEL LIKE I'M PLAYING FOR
EVERYONE THAT VOTED FOR ME.
 OH, WOW.
THAT'S A NICE BEACH.
 WE CAN PUT THE RICE RIGHT
HERE.
 WE CAN NAME THIS ONE BUT WE
CAN'T KILL IT.
 IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU IN THE
FLESH.
 YES, IT IS.
NO BROTHER, NO DAD, WE'RE GOOD.
 MR. JEFF, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SEEING THE BEACH, IT WAS JUST
DAY ONE BORNEO ALL OVER AGAIN.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY WE START
BUILDING SOME STUFF?
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS LET'S GET
CAMP GOING.
 WE CAN USE THAT CROTCH IN THE
TREE RIGHT THERE AND RUN A BEAM
OVER TO ABOUT HERE.
SOUND GOOD?
 SOUNDS GREAT.
 THAT WAY WE GET A NICE BREEZE
COMING ACROSS HERE.
 PERFECT.
 TO ME IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK
HARD AND BE USEFUL IN CAMP, AND
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHO THE
WORKERS WERE-- TERRY, ME, WOO.
 WE'RE GOING TO A-FRAME IT
THIS WAY?
 NO, NO, THIS WAY.
 SPENCER.
 OPENING THAT WAY.
 WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO SLEEP AND WHEN IT
STARTS RAINING, THEY'RE GOING TO
REMEMBER, HOPEFULLY, THAT I WAS
THERE WORKING AND BUILDING A
SHELTER.
THERE DOESN'T GET ANY MORE OLD
SCHOOL "SURVIVOR" THAN ME.
THAT'S IT.
 THANK YOU.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I
PLAYED, AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A
HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD
SCHOOL AND NEW SCHOOL.
THEY CAN PROBABLY GO ON TOP ON
THIS SIDE AND LATCH TO THE
BOTTOM ON THAT SIDE.
 OKAY.
 ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES
NOW IS THE FACT THAT THE GAME
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IS PLAYED
WHEN YOU HIT THE BEACH.
WHEREAS IN OLD SCHOOL, IT WAS
KIND OF LIKE WE NEEDED SHELTER,
AND WE NEEDED FIRE.
SO THAT THE BRACES WILL BE NICE
AND TIGHT.
MY SOCIAL GAME OVER THE PAST
NINE YEARS HAS HAUNTED ME A BIT.
AS WE'RE BUILDING THE SHELTER, I
HEAR MY WIFE'S VOICE IN MY EAR
GOING, "DON'T LET PEOPLE WALK
OFF ALL BY THEMSELVES."
MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING INTO
THE SOCIAL GAME BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, IT'S A BIG PART OF
"SURVIVOR."
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
 I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THE
BACKBONE.
WE HAVE YOU, YOU'RE THE PERSON
HERE WHO CAN MAKE FIRE, WHO CAN
DO THIS STUFF, BETTER THAN I
CAN, DEFINITELY, BETTER THAN
MOST PEOPLE CAN.
 WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN GET IT
GOING.
 THE CHALLENGE BEAST.
 YOU KNOW, I'M GOOD WITH THE
TEAM STUFF NOW BUT MY SON, HE'S
A "SURVIVOR" FANATIC, AND HE
WROTE ME UP A DOSSIER ON
EVERYBODY.
AND HE GOES, "YOU NEED TO ALIGN
WITH SPENCER.
HE'S A GOOD KID.
HE'S SOLID.
HE'S LOYAL."
 TERRY'S CHILDREN, THANK YOU
FOR HAVING YOUR DAD TRUST ME
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST ANYONE AND
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR
ME.
 I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.
 DEFINITELY, LIKE, I WANT TO
PLAY SOLID, PREDICTABLE,
RATIONAL GUYS.
 THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME, MAN.
IT REALLY DOES.
 I'M A NEW-SCHOOL PLAYER BUT
I'M AN EVER-SCHOOL FAN SO IT'S
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE REAL
RELATIONSHIPS AND KNOW WHAT
PEOPLE ARE THINKING.
I WANT TO HAVE MORE ONE-ON-ONE
CONVERSATIONS IN THE FIRST THREE
DAYS HERE THIS TIME THAN I HAD
IN MY ENTIRE GAME IN CAGAYAN.
CAGAYAN.
 I REALLY AM WEIRDED OUT ABOUT
MY BAG.
 WHOSE BAG IS THAT?
 IT'S NOT MINE.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR
BAG?
 YEAH, MY BRACELET.
I AM WORRIED BECAUSE MY BAG
DISAPPEARS, NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
 ABI, UP TO THE TAKE THIS BAG?
 I WANT MY BAG.
MY BRACELET IS INSIDE.
I HAVE THIS, LIKE, LEATHER
BRACELET WITH, LIKE, SOME GOLD
STUFF IN IT-- NOT REAL GOLD BUT
LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S MY SUPER
POWERS BRACELET.
IT WAS HANGING ON THAT TREE AND
IT'S JUST NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
 IT'S HERE.
 IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

 THERE'S NOTHING IN HER BAG
THAT SHE NEEDS RIGHT NOW BUT HER
BRACELET.
 HOW WEIRD.
THE LAST TIME IN THE
PHILIPPINES, I TOTALLY LET ME
EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF ME, AND
THAT WAS ONE OF MY DOWNFALLS.
I LOOKED INSIDE EVERY BAG.
MY BRACELET'S NOT INSIDE AND MY
BAG IS NOWHERE.
 YOU CHECKED ON THE ONES ON
THE TREE THERE.
 YEAH.
THIS TIME AROUND I TOLD MYSELF
THAT I WAS GOING TO CONTROL MY
EMOTIONS AND MY TEMPER, AND
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME THAT I
WANT TO PLAY RIGHT NOW.
BUT IT'S SO HARD FOR ME NOT TO
PULL OUT THE FANGS.
 HIT THE NAIL.
HIT IT!
♪ ♪ ♪
I GOT MY RHYTHM.
 IT'S HOLLOW.
IT'S HOLLOW.
 THE TRIBE SEEMS TO BE IN
REALLY GOOD SPIRITS.
EVERYBODY IS WORKING AROUND
CAMP.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING ALONG.
WE KIND OF HAVE, LIKE, A REALLY
PEACEFUL MANTRA ABOUT US, AND
I'M HOPING BY COMING OUT HERE A
SECOND TIME I CAN REWRITE MY
STORY.
 YOU REMEMBER THIS, TASH?
 I DO, I DO.
 WE DIDN'T HAVE PALM FRONDS SO
THIS IS MY LEARNING CURVE.
 ONE OF MY TRUE TALENTS IN
LIFE.
 ISN'T THIS CRAZY WE'RE
ALL BACK HERE AGAIN.
 YEAH.
 I'M SO HAPPY.
I LOVE IT.
 AIN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO
HANG OFF IT, BUT IT WILL HOLD.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D MAKE THE CUT
BUT HERE I AM.
HAPPY TO BE HERE NOW.
 LET'S GET THE FRAME BUILT.
 THERE YOU GO.
 LAST TIME I KIND OF COASTED
ON BY FOR A WHILE, EVEN WITHOUT
AN ALLIANCE.
THAT GETS YOU ALL THE WAY TO
FOURTH, BIG DEAL.
FOURTH PLACE IS A HARD PILL TO
SWALLOW.
SO I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE A LOT
BUT MAYBE TWEAK A LITTLE BIT.
 AND WE MAKE OUR LEAN-TO.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DEEP, JUST
RIGHT OFF THE EDGE.
 SECOND TIME IS GOING TO BE A
WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT.
NO FUMBLING THIS TIME.
 ACTUALLY, THIS IS A NEW
SEASON, RIGHT?
WE'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING BEHIND
US?
EVERYTHING IS IN THE PAST, AND
THIS IS, LIKE, SEASON 31.
WE'LL MOVE ON, AND WE'RE GOOD.
WITH THE TRIBE I FEEL GOOD.
I KNEW MY SEASON THAT THEY SAW
ME AS A THREAT, SO I FIGURE, LET
ME TALK TO KEITH.
THE ONLY THING I'M HOPING IS IF
KEITH HEARS MY NAME THAT HE
COMES BACK TO ME.
IN MY HEAD, KEITH, WE WERE GOOD.
 ME, TOO.
 I'M TRYING TO GO
STRATEGICALLY, AND REALLY USE MY
HEAD THIS SEASON.
SO I WANTED TASHA, PROBABLY THE
STRONGEST FEMALE OUT THERE.
 AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME, I'M
COOL.
 AND I WANTED SAVAGE.
SAVAGE SEEMS LIKE A REAL
STRAIGHT-UP GUY, ANOTHER
PHYSICAL THREAT.
 I'M TELLING YOU, I GOT YOUR
BACK.
 WE'RE GOOD.
WHAT ABOUT FISH?
 I DON'T HAVE A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT FISH.
 BUT MY NUMBER ONE THAT I
WANTED WAS JOE.
THERE'S NO BIGGER SHIELD OUT
HERE THAN JOE.
 WE'VE GOT AN AWESOME,
AWESOME-- AWESOME GROUP.
 DEFINITELY.
 SAVAGE IS ON BOARD.
 YEAH.
 I LIKE IT.
 COOL.
 AND IT KIND OF WORKED OUT
THAT WAY, AND I THINK IT WILL BE
SO DUMB FOR SOMEONE TO MESS THIS
UP.
Y'ALL ARE PUTTING IN WORK.
AND I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE
STRONGER GROUP.
WE COULD REALLY MOVE ON IN THIS
GAME.
WE COULD MAKE SOME NOISE NOYES.
WE JUST HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER
AND GET EACH OTHER'S BACK.
 DID I TELL YOU THIS-- THIS IS
A TRUE STORY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THIS-- MY DAUGHTERS WILL KILL
ME.
I HAVE A 17-YEAR-OLD AND A
15-YEAR-OLD AND WE'RE WATCHING
YOUR TAKEN AND I'M SITTING IN
BETWEEN MY DAUGHTERS AND MY
17-YEAR-OLD DIDN'T-- WASN'T--
DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS TALKING
OUT LOUD AND SHE GOES, "HE'S
PERFECTMENT.
AND THEN MY 15-YEAR-OLD GOES,
"YES, HE IS."
AND I SAID, I SAID, "LADIES, I'M
SITTING RIGHT HERE."
 DAD!
ONE THING I LEARNED LAST SEASON
WAS I'M THE BIGGEST THREAT, SO
YOU GOTTA MAKE MOVES TO ENSURE
YOU GO DEEPER IN THE GAME.
SO EITHER THE ALPHA MALES GO AT
EACH OTHER OR THEY ALIGN AND
COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER.
IN THE CASE OF, LIKE, JEREMY AND
SAVAGE, I THINK WE ALL ARE KIND
OF ON THE SAME PAGE OF LET'S
HELP EACH OTHER HELP EACH OTHER.
 HEY, YOU GUYS.
Y'ALL ARE KILLING IT.
LET ME JUST SAY.
 GO, ANDREW!
 ANDREW, YOU'RE THE MAN!
 TIMBER!
DOWN COMES THE TREE.
( CHEERS ).
 I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH THE
GUYS, SERIOUSLY.
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
 I FEEL EXACTLY LIKE FELT LAST
TIME, OUT OF PLACE ON A TRIBE
WITH GUYS WHO ARE NOT LIKE ME.
A FISHBACH OUT OF WATER ONCE
AGAIN.
 IT COULD BE THE SAME
NARRATIVE AS IT WAS FOR ME IN
TOCANES, WHERE I WAS OUT OF
PLACE AND CONNECTED WITH A
PEOPLE WHO WAS IN HIS ELEMENT
AND WE WENT TO THE END.
J.T., HE DESTROYED ME IN THE
END.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT
MISTAKE THE NEXT TIME.
ALL THESE MANLY MEN ON MY TRIBE,
IT IS MY NIGHTMARE.
 ARE YOU GOOD AT WEAVING?
 NO.
EITHER I'M GOING TO BE TOTALLY
IN CHARGE OF MY TRIBE-- THIS IS
A MESS.
OR I'M GOING TO DRAMATICALLY
OVERPLAY AND FLAME OUT REALLY
QUICKLY.
 I NEED SOME WATER.
I'M A LITTLE DIZZY.
 IT'S HOT.
 I JUST HAD A MOMENT.
 THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT,
TOO, TODAY.
 A LOT.
 ADRENALINE.
 AND WE'RE ALL TIRED.
 WHEN I PLAYED "SURVIVOR" THE
FIRST TIME I GOT PUT ON A TRIBE
WITH ALL WOMEN AND THEY WERE
GUNNING FOR ME HARD AND I WAS
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET MYSELF
IN THEIR GOOD GRACE.
I'M HAPPY WE'RE ON THE SAME
TRIBE, YOU AND I.
 I'M HAPPY, TOO.
 SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE
MANIPULATED THOSE WOMEN.
I DIDN'T MANIPULATE THE WOMEN.
I MANIPULATED SOME OF SMIR
PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT AND I'M GOOD
AT THAT.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
 HONG KONG.
 A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU, CHINESE,
FRECKLES, BEAUTIFUL.
 THANK YOU.
 BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, GREAT
THOUGHTS.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T
WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS A
MANIPULATOR BECAUSE THAT'S A
THREAT, ESPECIALLY EARLY ON.
I NEVER TALKED TO YOU BEFORE.
 I KNOW!
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE US "BLOOD
VS. WATER" PEOPLE.
I KNOW!
 I WANT THE WOMEN TO THINK
HE'S A SWEET GUY.
HE'S DOWN TO HELP OUT.
HE'S A NICE PERSON.
I WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO
SEE WHAT HE'S LIKE.
DON'T STRESS.
DON'T STRESS.
 TO ME, VYTAS COMES OFF AS
SMARMY, AND THAT'S HOW I READ
HIM IN HIS FIRST SEASON AND
THAT'S HOW I'M READING HIM NOW.
 HAMMER THAT NAIL INTO ME,
WOO, HAMMER IT INTO ME.
 SO RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE I
WANT TO PULL AWAY SOME CLEAR
PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO WORK WITH
AND JUST LOCK IT DOWN RIGHT OFF
THE BAT.
BECAUSE IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET A SECOND CHANCE EVER, LET
ALONE AT THIS GAME, AND I'M NOT
GOING TO SQUANDER IT.
SO VYTAS IS SUPER WELL
CONNECTED.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS PUT
THIS TOGETHER, VYTAS IS
CONNECTED WITH TERRY THROUGH
ARAS.
 THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
 AND ARAS AND TERRY ARE NOW
SUPER CLOSE, WHICH MEANS VYTAS
AND TERRY ARECROSE AND THEY'RE
PROBABLY LAYING LOW ABOUT ITT.
VYTAS HAS CLEAR CONNECTIONS AND
HE HAS VERY CLEAR CONNECTIONS TO
THE OTHER TRIBE AS WELL.
CIERA AND VYTAS PLAYED "BLOOD
VS. WATER" TOGETHER.
 YOU'RE VERY OBSERVANT.
I I HAVE TO GET IN THE MOOD FOR
THIS.
 YOU JUST HAVE TO WARM UP.
 SHIRIN IS TALKING A MILE A
MINUTE.
THIS TRAIN TOOK OFF AND I'M GLAD
I GOT ON IT.
I JUST GOT ON IT.
I DON'T CARE WHO IS PULLING ME
IN THE WOODS.
YES IS YOUR ANSWER.
 I FEEL GOOD ABOUT KELLY.
 I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT I LOVE
HER.
 I THINK WE CAN GET HER TO
VOTE WITH US.
 IT'S LIKE, DAMN, MAMA!
SLOW DOWN!
I JUST GOT HERE.
THE TRAIN WILL ONLY GO AS FAST
AS ITS CONDUCTOR WILL TAKE IT.
AND SHE HIT THE GAS.
WHAT JUST BIT MY ASS.
 WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT--
 LET'S GET WATER.
 P.G., I JUST THINK WE'RE
GOING TO NEED TO FEEL HER OUT.
 WHEN I DID IT THE FIRST TIME
IN THE OUTBACK, IT WAS ALL ABOUT
THE ADVENTURE.
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE STRATEGY AT
ALL.
I HAVEN'T PLAYED "SURVIVOR" IN
15 YEARS.
IS THIS THE WAY YOU DO IT NOW IS
I'M SO OUT OF MY ELEMENT RIGHT
NOW.
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S 15 YEARS
WAITING FOR THIS DISPIEWNT HERE
IT IS BUT IT'S COMING AT THE
RIGHT TIME FOR ME.
I'LL BE 50 NEXT YEAR.
THAT'S A BIG YEAR, AND MOST MEN
MY AGE GO THROUGH A MIDLIFE
CRISIS.
THEY BUY A CORVETTE.
THEY CHEAT ON THEIR WIVES.
I GO ON "SURVIVOR."
IT'S NOT ABOUT A MIDWIFE CRISE.
IT'S ABOUT A MIDLIFE QUEST, AND
THE SECOND HALF OF MY LIFE
BEGINS WITH "SURVIVOR: SECOND
CHANCE."
I JUST FEEL SO WEIRD, I FEEL
LIKE THE BABY.
 OKAY, SO WHERE'S MY BRACELET?
 ONE OF THOSE THAT'S HANGING?
 NO, IT'S NOT.
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
SHE HAS MY BAG.
 I FOUND IT.
 INSIDE PEIH-GEE'S BAG, MY
BRACELET.
 THAT'S PEIH-GEE'S BAG?
 WELL, HER NAME IS HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.
BUT I FOUND MY BRACELET.
THERE WAS ONE BAG WITH A NAME
PAG, PEIH-GEE.
AND I STICK MY HAND IN THERE,
AND FIRST THING THEY GRAB OUT OF
THE BAG IS MY FREAKING BRACELET.
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING, RIGHT?
 ARE YOU GONNA SAY ANYTHING?
 NO, BUT I KNOW NOW.
I FOUND MY BRACELET INSIDE
PEIH-GEE'S BAG.
I FOUND MY BRACELET.
 YOU DID?
 INSIDE PEIH-GEE'S BAG.
 NO WAY.
 I SWEAR TO GOD.
DO YOU THINK SHE INADVERTENTLY?
 I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE BENEFIT OF
THE DOUBT.
THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HER TO
STEAL MY BRACELET BUT IN MY HEAD
I'M LIKE, HM, MAYBE SHE WAS
TRYING TO WAKEN THE BRAZILIAN
DRAGON.
EVEN THOUGH DEEP INSIDE
SOMETIMES I WANT TO SCREAM AND
LET THE TEMPER TAKE OVER ME, I
CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.
IT'S MY SECOND CHANCE.
I HAVE TO PLAY SMART.
IT'S JUST FUNNY BECAUSE I'VE
BEEN LOOK AGO I WAS VERY VOCAL
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?
 YEAH, NO, YOU WERE.
 VERY VOCAL ABOUT IT.
 ABI-MARIA, SHE WAS CAUSING
WEIRDNESS AROUND THIS BRACELET
OF HERS THAT SHE THOUGHT I TOOK,
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WHAT?
I JUST WANT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
WITH HER BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
HER TO THINK I STOLE HER DAMN
BRACELET.
 I HEARD YOUR BRACELET WAS IN
MY BAG.
 YEAH, IT WAS IN YOUR BAG.
 YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, THERE
WAS A BAG WITH NO NAME TAG ON IT
HANGING UP.
 THAT WAS MY BAG.
 AND I DIDN'T REALIZE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ANYTHING
IN IT, SO I JUST GRABBED IT--
 NO, I GAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE
DOUBT.
 YEAH YEAH, I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR IT SO MUCH.
 I WAS.
I WAS LOOKING FOR IT A LONG
TIME.
 THE LAST TIME I WAS ON
"SURVIVOR," I DIDN'T FORM THE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I SHOULD
HAVE.
I'VE LEARNED YOU MAKE FRIENDS
BUT YOU KEEP YOUR ENEMIES A
LITTLE BIT CLOSER.
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE COOL.
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK,
LIKE--
 LIKE, I TOLD YOU, I WAS
GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE
DOUBT.
 OH, LOOK, THEY'RE TRYING TO
MAKE FIRE.
 WHEW!
THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE GAME
RIGHT HERE, LIKE THE MOST
IMPORTANT, FIRE, WATER, SHELTER.
 I MEAN, YOU CAN SMELL IT.
IT'S COMING.
 YEAH.
 THESE DIDN'T WORK ON MY
SEASON, SO I DON'T KNOW, BUT ONE
WAY TO FOCUS THE LIGHT IS TAKE A
LEAF AND PUT A PINHOLE IN IT.
 OR A DROP OF WATER.
 YEAH.
OUT HERE SECOND CHANCES IT KIND
OF SETS A TONE FOR EVERYONE LIKE
THIS IS IT.
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
GETTING VOTED BACK IN BECAUSE I
FLIPPED OFF SOMEONE BUT I THINK
PEOPLE KNOW I'M GOING TO PLAY
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
FIREWORKS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HERE TO
PROVE SOMETHING.
I JUST WANT TO WIN.
I DON'T CARE HOW I DO IT.
 I THINK HE'S TRYING TO LOOK
FOR AN IDOL.
 OH, REALLY?
 I'M GOING LOOKING FOR WOOD.
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF LOOKING
FOR THE IDOL BECAUSE FIDON'T
FIND THAT IDOL, SOMEONE ELSE IS
GOING TO FIND IT.
BUT THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE BEACH,
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF TREES.
I WALKED INTO THIS DISGUSTING,
MUDDY SWAMP.
IT WAS NASTY.
I DON'T IMAGINE JEFF PROBST IS
GOING INTO THAT SWAMP TO HIDE AN
IDOL BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GAME
ON.
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE IT
FIND AN IDOL, SOME CRAZY BOG IN
THE THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
I NEED THE IDOL, OR I NEED TO
CREATE A SOLID LINK WITH SOME
PEOPLE WHO HOPEFULLY WON'T JUDGE
ME FOR BEING A NERD?
I'M SURE PEOPLE NOTICED THAT I
WAS LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.
I HOPE I'M NOT GETTING BRANDED
WITH THAT IDOL-- I PROBABLY AM--
FISHBACH IS LOOKING FOR THE
IDOL.
DANG IT.
 YOU GOT IT, BROTHER.
 YOU GOT IT.
YOU GOT IT.
 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
 YOU GOT IT.
 WE GOT FIRE!
 JOE!
 YAY!
 THAT'S TEAM WORK!
 TEAM WORK MAKES A DREAM WORK.
( APPLAUSE ).
 AWESOME JOB.
 HOW AWESOME IS THAT?
 THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
 I'M STILL JUST IN AWE OF THE
FACT THAT JOE GOT FIRE.
 JUST HAD TO START FROM
SWRACH.
THAT IS ALL.
 AND I PRAYED OVER IT.
 THAT WAS ALL YOU.
 AND JOE WAS JUST INCREDIBLE.
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WITH THIS
HUMIDITY.
WE THUMPED MOTHER NATURE ON DAY
ONE BY GETTING FIRE AND THAT, I
THINK, IS A GREAT SIGN OF THINGS
TO COME.
 CHEERS TO "SURVIVOR."
 MY WORLD IS SPINNING.
DAY TWO, I FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER
PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE.
IT'S ODD.
IT'S HOT.
AND I WANT TO COOL OFF.
THIS GAME IS WAY TOO FAST.
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.
BUT I'M PLAYING HARD.
AND I'M TRYING NOT TO LOOK LIKE
I'M PLAYING HARD BUT I'M PLAYING
HARD.
WHO DO YOU SEE IN GROUPS SO FAR,
JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE
SAME PAGE.
 I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE SHELTER
PEOPLE.
 THE SHELTER PEOPLE?
 RIGHT.
 VERSUS THE BEACH PEOPLE.
 ARE WE BEACH PEOPLE?
 I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I'VE
DONE BOTH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I'VE WALKED THE BEACH AND I'VE
WORKED THE SHELTER.
THERE ARE TO DIVISIONS HAPPENING
ON THIS BEACH RIGHT NOW.
THERE'S THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THE
SHELTER, THE OLD-SCHOOLERS.
OLD SCHOOL WANTS TO DO IT THE
WAY OLD SCHOOL DID IT-- YOU WORK
AND THAT'S WHAT YOUR VALUE IS.
AND THE NEW SCHOOL WANTS TO JUST
TAKE OFF RUNNING DOWN THE BEACH
AND GET ME INTO AN ALLIANCE.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TURN ON THE
SHELTER PEOPLE, MY OLD FOLKS.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A WEIRD
SITUATION.
 SO AM I.
 I THINK YOU AND I ARE IN THE
SAME SEAT, ACTUALLY.
 IF YOU WERE FORCED TO PICK
SOMEBODY FOR A FIRST BOOT--
 I THINK SHIRIN WANTED TO GET
RID OF VYTAS.
 I THINK WE NEED TO LOSE
SOMEBODY LIKE ABI.
 IT'S MY SECOND CHANCE, AND
I'M IN SOMETHING I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN BEFORE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO.
OLD SCHOOL-NEW SCHOOL.
WHAT DO I DO?
 GOOD MORNING!
 GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.
 WE NEED WATER.
 I THINK I DEFINITELY HAVE TO
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE GAME
THAT I PLAYED LAST TIME.
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T TAKE AS
MANY RISKS AS I SHOULD HAVE.
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET SECOND
CHANCES, AND I'M NOT GOING TO
WASTE IT.
AND GENERALLY, HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL IS ALREADY IN CAMP WHEN YOU
GET THERE.
SO I EXPECTED IN A SECOND CHANCE
SEASON THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO BE ONE.
SO MANY PALM FRONDS.
WORKING SO HARD.
I TOOK ON THE TASK OF GETTING
PALM FRONDS AND COCONUT AND I
KNEW THAT WOULD GIVE ME AN
OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY LOOK
FOR AN IDOL.
PUT THINGS ON THE PATH, WHEN
PEOPLE COME BY, I CAN BE OH,
LOOK.
I'M PUTTING THINGS OUT FOR YOU
TO TAKE BACK.
YEAH.
SNEAKY, SNEAKY!
WHERE IS THE IDOL?
ERRRR.
EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME HERE.
IF YOU WERE AN IDOL, WHERE WOULD
YOU BE?
WHERE WOULD YOU BE?
EWW.
NOT IN THERE.
I LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME, AND
THEN I HAPPENED TO WALK BY ONE
TREE.
OH!
SHUT THE ( BLEEP ) UP!
OH, SHUT UP.
OH, MY GOD.
OKAY.
OKAY.
WHEW!
THAT IS AMAZING.
I JUST FOUND-- I THINK I JUST
FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
OKAY.
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS HUGE.
OH, MY GOD!
I HOPE-- WHAT IS IT?
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND A
CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
OKAY, I JUMPED THE GUN A LITTLE.
"SECURITY YOU SEEK IS WITHIN
REACH BUT IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO
BE DARING.
NEAR THE END OF YOUR NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE YOU'LL PLACE
YOUR RAFT ON A STAND MADE OF
FOUL SMALL TRIPODS.
TICKED UP UNDER THE RIGHT FRONT
TRIPOD IS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS ARE YOU
BOLD ENOUGH TO GRAB IT IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CHALLENGE?
IF SO, THE IMMUNITY IS YOURS."
USUALLY THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
IS IN CAMP.
FOR IT TO BE AT A CHALLENGE IS
CRAZY BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN SEE
YOU IF YOU'RE NOT SNEAKY ENOUGH.
THIS IS AMAZING.
IF I GET TO THE CHALLENGE AND
FEEL LIKE I CAN PULL IT OFF--
I'M SO HAPPY-- I'LL TRY TO GRAB
IT.
OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE SUPER
OBVIOUS.
 BAYON, IT'S ANY TIME.
COME ON!
IT IS GO TIME.
THIS IS OUR OFFICIAL FLAG.
 THAT'S BAD-SS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
15 YEARS WAITING TO RETURN, THE
FIRST CHALLENGE EVER DONE.
AND THEN THE FIRST PLAYER IS
VOTED OUT.
NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM SO FUN.
 FIRST CHALLENGE.
 OUR FIRST CHALLENGE IS GOING
TO BE THE VERY FIRST SURVIVOR
CHALLENGE ON THE VERY FIRST
"SURVIVOR," AND TO BE ABLE TO
GET THE FIRST TREE MAIL AFTER
WAITING SO LONG, IT'S-- YOU
KNOW, YOU GET THESE LITTLE
BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH.
 THIS IS "SURVIVOR," BUT THIS
IS A FAMILY, RIGHT.
WE ARE 10 STRONG, HARMONY.
AND IN THIS CHALLENGE, EVERYBODY
HERE IS GOING TO GET GASSED.
 YEAH.
 RIGHT, AND WE PICK EACH OTHER
UP.
 TREE MAIL KIND OF GETS ME
NERVOUS.
IT'S NO SECRET THAT I'M ONE OF
THE SMALLEST PEOPLE HERE AND THE
FIRST TIME I PLAYED I ALWAYS
TRIED TO DOWNPLAY THAT AND NOT
MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.
BUT NOW I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I HOLD MY OWN.
I THINK I'M STRONGER NOW.
 NOW JUST GO DOWN.
LET OUT, LIKE, ALL THAT OUT.
ALL THAT NASTINESS.
 JOE DOWN THERE DOING YOGA,
AND I DON'T DO YOGA.
I GET NUPT MORNING KNOW I HAVE A
CUP OF COFFEE AND GO TO WORK,
LIKE 99% OF AMERICANS DO.
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE ME BEND OVER
AND GET CONTORTED OUT THERE AND
ALL THAT.
I THINK JOE IS A FREE-SPIRIT
PRETTY BOY WITH THE HAIR.
YEAH, GREAT, GREAT AROUND CAMP.
PEEL STUFF, CHOP STUFF.
BUTIOCA, THAT-- THAT'S JOE.
 AT THE TOP OF YOUR BREATH.
 TODAY, WE DID SOME NOT YOGA,
SOME JOGA.
AND, HONESTLY, I WAS A LITTLE
DISTRACTED.
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BREATHE,
BUT ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS
JOE'S BODY.
HOW CAN YOU FOCUS LOOKING AT
JOE?
BUT I THINK WE ARE IN A GOOD
MENTAL PLACE TO WIN THIS
CHALLENGE.
SO I'M EXCITED.
WE'RE PUMPED.
 WALK YOUR FEET BACK RIGHT
ABOUT THERE.
NOW PULL YOUR HIMSELF BACK,
PRESS YOUR HEELS DOWN, DROP YOUR
CHEST IN.
IT'S LIKE A MODIFIED VERSION OF
DOWNWARD DOG.
WE CALL IT PUPPY DOG.
FEEL THE LENGTH IN YOUR TORSO.
 BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, VYTAS
SHOWED ME SOME OF HIS YOGA
MOVES.
 REMEMBER YOU CAN DO IT
AGAINST A TREE LIKE THIS.
 I'M GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE
REMEMBERING.
 AGAINST THE BOAT, LIKE THIS.
 I'LL NEED A QUIZ LATER.
 AND THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE.
IF YOU'RE FEELING HUNCHED OVER--
 HE CAN BE SO OVER THE TOP.
HE'S SO YOGA!
AND SVRINIVASA, MONKEY POSE.
 LIFT ACROSS THE CHEST.
OPENING UP ACROSS THE ARMPITS
AND THE COLLAR BONES.
 VYTAS JUST GOING AROUND JUST,
LIKE, TRYING TO FLIRT, AND IT'S
ANNOYING ME.
IT'S NOT SEXY IN ANY WAY.
LIKE, JUST GO AWAY.
YOU'RE LIKE A BUG.
GET AWAY.
SO I WANT VYTAS OUT, LIKE, DONE.
HE'S DEAD TO ME.
HE'S ANNOYING ME.
 YOU COULD EVEN DO IT ON
SOMETHING LIKE THE SHELTER HERE.
IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT...
 SHE'S LOOKING AT YOUR IDOL.
 I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.
 ABI, WANT SOME YOGA?
 NO.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
HOW IS YOUR BODY FEELING?
 I'M FEELING GREAT.
 ABI'S A TOUGH PERSON TO DEAL
WITH.
SHE GETS ANNOYED WITH PEOPLE ON
A DIME AND ABI SENT ME SOME
NEGATIVE VIBES THIS MORNING.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF ABI
WHISPERED, "LET'S GET OUT
VYTAS."
I NEED TO MAKE SURE I DON'T GET
TOO COMFORTABLE.
MY MISTAKE LAST TIME WAS MY LACK
OF AWARENESS AND OVERCONFIDENCE.
 WE WANT TO WIN THE
CHALLENGES, BUT I WAS THINKING
IT WOULD BE ABI RIGHT OFF THE
BAT.
 IT WOULD BE SMART TO GET OUT
ABI BECAUSE WE COULD GET EVERY
SINGLE PERSON ON BOARD BECAUSE
NOBODY LIKES HER.
BUT THIS IS STILL THE BEGINNING
OF THE DAY.
SOMEBODY MIGHT DO SOMETHING REAL
STUPID LATER IN THE DAY.
SOMEBODY MIGHT DO SOMETHING BAD
IN THE CHALLENGE.
IF THE TIDE IS GOING IN ABI'S
DIRECTION, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
JUST, LIKE, LET IT GO.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
 THE FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THAT'S ALL I HAD ON MY MIND.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
READY TO GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 OH, YEAH.
 YEAH!
 Jeff: I LIKE THE
ENTHUSIASM!
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, BOTH
TRIBES WILL RACE OUT TO A RAFT
WHERE YOU WILL LIGHT A TORCH.
YOU'LL USE THAT TORCH TO LIGHT A
SERIES OF FIRES, MAKING YOUR WAY
TO A STAND WHERE YOU WILL PLACE
YOUR RAFT.
THEN ONE PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE
WILL USE STICKS AND ROPE TO
FASHION A LONG POLE.
YOU'LL USE THAT POLE TO RETRIEVE
A KEY.
FIRST TRIBE TO OPEN THEIR GATE
AND LIGHT THEIR FINAL FIRE WINS
IMMUNITY, IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
 YEAH!
 Jeff: YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS GAME.
THIS IS SECURITY AND CERTAINTY.
WITHOUT IT, YOU COULD BE IN
TROUBLE.
IN ADDITION, YOU ARE ALSO
PLAYING FOR REWARD.
 NICE!
 Jeff: MASSIVE "SURVIVOR"
FIRE-MAKING KIT.
FLINT, KEROSENE, MATCHES.
YOU'VE GOT A TARP FOR YOUR WOOD.
MAKES LIFE A WHOLE LOT EASIER.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
SECOND CHANCE."
THIS CHALLENGE IS VERY SPECIAL
IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
QUEST FOR FIRE WAS THE VERY
FIRST CHALLENGE EVER RUN IN OUR
FIRST EPISODE.
KELLY WIGLESWORTH WAS THERE.
SHE LOST.
 THANKS FOR REMINDING ME,
JEFF.
 Jeff: SO THIS IS A SECOND
CHANCE WITH REALLY BIG STAKES.
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE,
WE'LL GET IT ON.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
IMMUNITY AND FIRE ON THE LINE!
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS IS IT, YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE
AT SECOND CHANCER.
YOU CANNOT MOVE YOUR RAFT UNTIL
EVERYBODY IS HERE.
 COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: TASHA LAST TO GET
THERE.
 LET'S GO!
 TA KEO IS FIRST.
BAYON RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO
MOVE THAT RAFT.
IT TAKES A LOT OF COMMUNICATION.
KEITH HAS THE TORCH FOR BAYON.
SPENCER GOING TO GET THE TORCH
FOR TA KEO.
SPENCER HAS THE FIRST FIRE FOR
TA KEO.
KEITH HAS THE FIRST ONE FOR
BAYON.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK.
SPENCER HAS THE SECOND FIRE.
KEITH HASLET SECOND FIRE FOR HIS
TRIBE!
KEITH LOST HIS FIRE.
GOTTA GET IT LIT, KEITH!
 LIGHT IT AGAIN!
 Jeff: KEITH LOSING VALUABLE
TIME.
 COME OKEITH.
 Jeff: SPENCE ARE FOR TA
KEO.
LIGHT THAT THIRD FIRE.
 COME ON KEITH!
 Jeff: KEITH STRUGGLING WITH
THAT FIRE.
KEITH REACHING FOR THAT THIRD
FIRE FOR BAYON.
HE'S GOT IT.
SPENCER HAS THE FOURTH FIRE LIT

BAYON IS SLOWING DOWN NOW.
TA KEO IS STARTING TO PULL
AHEAD.

 Jeff: SPENCER HAS THE FIFTH
FIRE FOR TA KEO.
HEAD OUT!
KEITH REACHING FOR BAYON.
HE'S GOT IT!
TA KEO WITH THE EARLY LEAD.
STILL LIGHTING FIRES.
 GO!
 Jeff: KEITH CONTINUES TO
STRUGGLE WITH THE FIRE.
THAT'S COSTING TIME.
KEITH HAS THE FIFTH FIRE FOR
BAYON.
 COME ON.
 Jeff: TA KEO HAS ALL THEIR
FIRES LIT.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO PLACE YOUR
RAFT ON THE STAND!
 GOOD JOB.
 THERE, GO!
IT'S IN, GO!
 Jeff: IT IS KELLY
WIGLESWORTH GOING TO GO TO WORK.
 COME ON, KELLY, YOU'VE GOT
THIS.
 Jeff: ON THE STICKS AND
ROPES TO PASSION A POLE LONG
ENOUGH TO GET A KEY.
 I LOOKED BACK AND THOUGHT
CRAP I MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
GET AN IDOL.
AS MUCH AS I WANT THE IDOL, I
DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO SEE ME
GET THE IDOL BECAUSE THEN THEY
MIGHT TARGET ME.
 Jeff: BAYON FINALLY BACK.
WHO'S GOING TO DO IT?
IT'S GOING TO BE JOE WORKING FOR
BAYON.
KELLY FOR TA KEO.
 YOU GOT THIS, KELLY.
 KEL, I'VE SEEN THIS DONE.
JUST DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.
 Jeff: YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THE POLE LONG ENOUGH AND STRONG
ENOUGH TO RETRIEVE THE KEY.
 ONE MORE.
 ONE MORE.
 WAY AHEAD, KEEP GOING.
 Jeff: A LOT EASIER SAID
THAN DONE.
IT IS A LONG THROW TO THAT KEY.
 YOU'RE IN AWESOME SHAPE.
YOU GOT THIS.
 THIS ONE SHOULD DO IT RIGHT
HERE.
 EASY, EASY.
 Jeff: KELLY GOING TO GIVE
IT A GO.
LET'S SEE IF SHE'S GOT ENOUGH.
 KEEP IT FLAT, RIGHT?
 KEEP GOING, JOE.
 IT'S GOING TO BREAK.
 NOT LONG ENOUGH, KEL.
 Jeff: KELLY GOING TO BE FAR
SHORT.
SHE'S GOT TO ADD SOME MORE
STICKS.
 DO IT, JOE.
 SHE'S OUT OF STICK.
 COME ON, KELLY, HURRY.
YOU GOTTA, BABY, YOU GOT IT.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 Jeff: JOE NOW GOING TO GIVE
IT A SHOT.
DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH POLE AND IS
IT STRONG ENOUGH TO GET THERE?
IT LOOKS LONG ENOUGH.
IS IT STRONG ENOUGH?
 GO FROM THE TOP.
 Jeff: HUGE IMMUNITY ON THE
LINE!
NOBODY WANTS TO GO HOME!
CAN HE GET THERE?
JOE REACHING IF THAT ARE KEY.
HE'S ALL AROUND IT.
IS HIS POLE STRONG ENOUGH TO GET
IT OFF?
WIGLESWORTH GOING FOR IT NOW.
CAN SHE GET THERE?
JOE ON THAT KEY TRYING TO LIFT
IT OFF.
 UP, UP.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH GETS THE
KEY.
JOE'S GOT THE KEY.
WIGLESWORTH CAN'T GET IT.
JOE SLOWLY MOVING THE KEY.
 DON'T DROP IT.
DON'T DROP IT.
 Jeff: IT'S WORKING!
JOE HAS THE KEY!
CAN HE GET IT BACK?
YES!
SPENCER COMING IN NOW TO TRY TO
CATCH UP FOR TA KEO WHO HAS ONE
SHOT.
BAYON WORKING ON THAT LOCK WHILE
SPENCER TRIES TO REACH THE KEY.
CAN HE DO IT?
HE'S ON IT!
NO!
IT DROPPED SHORT.
BAYON THROUGH THE GATE.
ONE FIRE LEFT TO BURN FOR THE
WIN IN THE FIRST CHALLENGE OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE."
BAYON WINS IMMUNITY!
SENDING TA KEO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 UNBELIEVABLE!
 I BLEW IT.
 Jeff: BAYON,
CONGRATULATIONS.
FIRST CHALLENGE.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THE BAYON
TRIBE.
GRAB YOUR REWARD, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH, 15 YEARS
LATER, SAME RESULT.
 SAME RESULT.
 Jeff: DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE
RESPONSIBILITY?
 OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I FEEL 100% RESPONSIBLE.
WE HAD A STRONG LEAD, AND THAT
WAS WHERE WE FELL BEHIND, AND
THAT WAS MY FAULT, AND I TAKE IT
ALL ON.
 SERIOUSLY.
 Jeff: YEAH, YOU'RE
EMOTIONAL.
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T
LIKE TO LET PEOPLE DOWN?
 SHE HASN'T LET US DOWN, JEFF.
 SHE'S AWESOME.
 DON'T WORRY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TA KEO,
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU EXCEPT A
DATE WITH ME TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND WE ARE HEADING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL RIGHT NOW.
 WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND TO
TALK ABOUT GAME PLAY, STRATEGY,
NOTHING.
 I AM NERVOUS AS HELL GOING TO
A TRIBAL WITHOUT GETTING YOUR
DUCKS IN A ROW.
WE HAVE A TRIBE WITH ABI-MARIA,
JEFF VARNER, AND ALL THE
CRAZYIES UNDER THE SUN.
IF THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
HAPPENS, IT'S EQUIVALENT TO ALL
OF YOUR DUCKS GETTING SHOT BY A
RIFLE AT ONCE.
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH, DIP
IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SO, SPENCER, WHAT DOES "SECOND
CHANCE" MEAN NOW THAT YOU'RE
HERE AND YOU WERE VOTED IN BY
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WATCHED YOU
PLAY?
 YEAH, THERE'S AN ENTIRE NEW
ELEMENT OF HEARTBREAK WHEN YOU
CONSIDER THAT IF YOU GO HOME
TONIGHT, YOU'RE LETTING DOWN
YOURSELF, FRIENDS AND FAMILY,
AND NOW, EVERYONE WHO WANTED TO
SEE YOU HAVE THAT SECOND CHANCE.
 Jeff: WOO, WHAT DID YOU
NOTICE IN THOSE EARLY MOMENTS?
BECAUSE SOMETIMES RIGHT OUT OF
THE GATE PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING
AND TALKING AND MAKING
ALLIANCES.
 ABSOLUTELY.
IMMEDIATELY, YOU CAN SEE A BIG
DIVISION HAPPENING.
THERE'S THE OLD-SCHOOL WAY OF
PLAYING WHERE, HEY, LET'S BUILD
A SHELTER.
AND THEN THE NEW-SCHOOL WAY IS
LET'S GO STRATEGIZE, LET'S GO
TALK.
AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR.
 Jeff: DEITZ, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT?
 YEAH, I'D SAY SO, AND I'M
PART OF THE OLD-SCHOOL REGIME,
AND WE WERE BUSY BUILDING, NOT
GETTING MUCH OF A CHANCE TO TALK
AND THEN AFTER A WHILE SAT DOWN
WITH A FEW PEOPLE AND WE STARTED
TALKING AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF
THE GAME.
 Jeff: IT'S A HUGE PART OF
THE GAME.
 YEAH.
IT WAS AN EYE OPENER TO SEE IT
HAPPENING THAT FAST.
IT REALLY WAS.
 Jeff: PEIH-GEE, HOW
IMPORTANT IS IT TO ASSESS WHERE
YOU WERE WHEN YOU PLAYED THE
FIRST TIME AND ADAPT TO GET TO
WHERE YOU NEED TO BE WHEN YOU
PLAY THE SECOND TIME?
 THAT'S WHAT "SECOND CHANCE"
IS ABOUT.
DID YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES
THE FIRST TIME?
ARE YOU ABLE TO CORRECT THEM?
I THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING REALLY
HARD TO KIND OF SPLIT THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAMP LIFE,
GETTING TO KNOW EVERYBODY.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T GET STUCK
MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES THAT
YOU DID THE FIRST TIME.
 Jeff: ABI, WHAT'S YOUR
SECOND CHANCE ABOUT?
 IT'S ABOUT GROWTH.
IT'S ABOUT LEARNING FROM MY
MISTAKES.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD SITUATIONS
WHERE I COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY
FIRECRACKER, AND I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO COUNT TO 10 AND JUST HOLD
BACK AND REACH THE NEXT LEVEL OF
MY CONFIDENCE.
 Jeff: VYTAS, YOU HAVE ONE
ELEMENT OF YOUR SECOND CHANCE
STORY THAT'S UNIQUE.
YOU HAVE A LOVED ONE WHO NOT
ONLY PLAYED BUT WON.
 YEAH, NOT ONLY DID ARAS WIN
THIS GAME, BUT ARAS BEAT TERRY.
OF COURSE, I WOULD LOVE TO WIN
IT, BUT IF DEITZ OUTLASTS ME
ARAS WILL ALWAYS RUB IT IN AND
SAY, "I BEAT DEITZ, YOU COULDN'T
BEAT HIM."
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH.
HOW OF AN IMPACT WILL IT HAVE
THAT WE LEFT DIRECTLY FROM THE
CHALLENGE AND CAME HERE AND YOU
DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPECTED TIME TO
GO BACK AND HUDDLE IN YOUR
CORNERS?
 I THINK IT WILL IMPACT THE
VOTE IN A BIG WAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE'S THEY STAND.
FOR ME, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I'M
TRYING TO CATCH UP.
 JEFF, I THINK PEOPLE KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TONIGHT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY STAIRK
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK ON
THIS BEACH IN THE LAST THREE
DAYS.
 Jeff: VYTAS, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THAT?
IS THIS GOING TO BE A RANDOM,
GUT INSTINCT VOTE OR ARE THERE
FACTIONS ALREADY?
 I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE
TALKED, I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND WHO THEY WANT TO WORK
WITH, WHERE THEY STAND.
SO IT'S COMPLETELY NOT RANDOM
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: WOO, HOW BIG IS
TONIGHT'S VOTE?
 IT'S VERY CRITICAL AND WILL
SET THE TEMPO OF THE GAME.
AND FOR ME PERSONALLY, I HAVE NO
IDEA.
I'M SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW, AND
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M
GOING.
 Jeff: AND, ABI, THE
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT IS
NOW YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHO
WOO'S LOOKING AT.
 RIGHT NOW NOW I SEE THE
DIVISION CLEARLY.
 Jeff: AND WHAT IS IT?
 CLEARLY A MELDING THAT'S
GOING ON WITH THEM.
 JEFF, THERE'S NOT A MALE
THING GOING ON.
I THINK AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME TRIBE UNITY IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART OF WHERE WHO YOU
ARE VOTING FOR.
 Jeff: ABEERK ARE YOU
ROCKING BACK AND FORTH.
 I FEEL NERVOUS.
>. Jeff: IF IT'S YOU WHO GOES
HOME TONIGHT, WHERE WILL THIS
STORY SIT WITH YOU?
 HEARTBREAKING, I'M NOT READY
TO GO.
 Jeff: WOO, WHAT IS IT LIKE
TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY IT WILL BE
HEARTBREAKING.
 IT'S TOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, BUT AT
THE END OF THE DAY IT'S HOW WELL
YOU GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY
ELSE.
 IT'S OBVIOUS HE'S VOTING FOR
ME TONIGHT.
NOW, I KNOW.
 Jeff: AND DEEPER THAN THAT,
ABEERK HE'S HITTING ON THE THING
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO WORK ON,
YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS.
 RIGHT, THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM
FOR GROWTH.
YOU'RE ALWAYS LEARNING EVERY
DAY, LITTLE BY LITTLE.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH, ARE YOU
CONCERNED YOU MIGHT MAKE THE
WRONG VOTE TONIGHT?
 I THINK MY GUT'S TELLING ME
WHICH WAY TO VOTE, AND I THINK
I'M PICKING UP ON SOME CUES.
 Jeff: VARNER, WIGLESWORTH
MENTIONED THE CUES, HOW BIG OF A
PART OF THE GAME WAS THAT
KNOWING THIS IS NOT THE WAY IT
WAS WHEN YOU PLAYED?
 IT'S HUGE.
I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT PICKING UP
ON CUES.
SO MUCH SO I'VE HAD VERY LITTLE
SLEEP.
I'VE HAD LITTLE TIME TO GO THE
THINGS I WOULD HAVE DONE IN
AUSTRALIA.
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF MY
OLD-SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS ARE
PARTICIPATING IN THIS NEW WORLD
AS HARD AS I AM.
I'M BALLS TO THE WALL AND I'M
DYING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: BEFORE WE VOTE, AM I
MISSING ANYTHING?
THERE'S AN ELEPHANT HERE.
IS THERE AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
 I THINK IF THERE IS AN
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, WE'RE
ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
 Jeff: WOW.
 IT'S MY SECOND CHANCE.
I DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT NIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
WOO, YOU'RE UP.
 I'M SORRY, VYTAS.
 I WANTED TO PLAY WITH YOU,
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ROOM
FOR GROWTH.
.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, VYTAS.
ABI.
VYTAS.
ABI.
VYTAS.
ABI.
THAT'S THREE VOTES VYTAS, THREE
VOTES ABI.
VYTAS.
ABI.
FOUR VOTES VYTAS, FOUR VOTES
ABI, TWO VOTES LEFT.
VYTAS.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES VYTAS, FOUR
VOTES ABI, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE,"
VYTAS.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 Jeff: VYTAS, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 NO HARD FEELINGS YOU GUYS.
PLAY SUCH A GREAT GAME.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
 Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE
ILL STRAIGHTS ONE THING VERY
CLEARLY-- YOUR SECOND CHANCE CAN
END AT ANY TIME.
WHICH MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THE MOST OF IT.
AND NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, FIRE IN THE FORM
OF FLINT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
BACK AT CAMP.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.
 I'M SORRY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
ME.
THAT I ANNOY YOU.
 Jeff: ABI IS PLAYING THE
SAME OLD GAME.
 YOU ( BLEEP ) WITH ME,
YOU'RE
DEAD.
 Jeff: WHILE VARN SER TRYING
TO CHANGE IT UP.
 ALL OF THESE
THREATS, I'VE
GOT TO GO.
 I DON'T LIKE THESE PEOPLE.
IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL.
GET OFF YOUR ASS, AND PLAY THIS
GAME.
 I REMEMBER SAYING BEFORE I
CAME OUT HERE, I REMEMBER SAYING
I'D RATHER NOT GET PICKED THAN
GET PICKED AND BE THE FIRST
BOOT.
AND IT SUCKS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I CAME OUT
HERE, AND I TRIED TO FIND THE
PEOPLE I WANTED TO WORK WITH,
AND, APPARENTLY, THEY SAW ME AS
A BIG THREAT.
LIKE, IT'S TOTAL RESPECT.
LIKE THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME WITH
GOOD REASON.
