         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": TA KEO WAS THRIVING,
AND HAD PUT TOGETHER A STRONG
FIVE.
 THIS IS FINAL FIVE.
 I'M TRYING TO PULL IN AS MANY
PEOPLE AS I CAN.
 Jeff: WHILE ANGKOR WAS
BARELY GETTING BY.
 WE ARE IN HELL RIGHT NOW.
THIS ISN'T WORKING.








 Jeff: BUT AT THE LAST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE-- WOO
LAUNCHES!
THEY FINALLY WON.
ANGKOR WINS IMMUNITY.
SENDING BAYON TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
BACK AT CAMP, WIGLESWORTH AND
SPENCER WERE ON THE OUTS.
 I STILL SAY KELLY.
 BUT MONICA WANTED TO CHANGE
THINGS YOU WANT.
 SHE'S A LOOSE CANNON AND
SHE'D BE A FLIPPER.
 Jeff: AND EVERYTHING DID








CHANGE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN
MONICA WAS BLINDSIDED.
MONICA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 TERRY.
HEY, IT'S PROBST.
 HEY.
 Jeff: I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND.
COME ON OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, GUYS.
COME DOWN HERE ON THE BEACH.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: I KNOW THIS IS A
SHOCK, WAKING YOU UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T
SERIOUS.
 NO QUESTION.
I'LL GO BACK, GRAB MY BAG, AND,
UH, TELL THEM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO
IT.
 THEN WE'LL GO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO
WITH YOU.
 OKAY, THANKS.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 MY BOY, DANNY,"HE ENDED UP
BEING HOSPITALIZED, AND MY WIFE
AND THE DOCTOR THINK THAT IT'S
BEST THAT I GO HOME.
 OH, MY GOD.
 TERRY!
 OH, MY GOD!
 FOR ME, THERE WAS NO CHOICE.
 TERRY!
 I APPRECIATE ALL YOU GUYS AND
EVERYTHING.
 I'M SORRY, TERRI.
 YOU'VE HELPED ME FOLLOW
THROUGH ON ANOTHER DREAM AND I
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITH FINER
PEOPLE, FINER PEOPLE.
 THANKS SO MUCH FOR
EVERYTHING.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET ME JUST GRAB MY BAG.
 I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE A
PARENT TO UNDERSTAND HOW
DEVASTATING IT WOULD BE TO BE
OUT HERE AND GET A CALL THAT
YOUR CHILD IS SICK AND YOU NEED
TO GET HOME.
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE.
 BE WELL.
GOOD LUCK.
KICK SOME ASS.
KEEP IT UP.
 TERRY, BE GOOD, BUDDY.
 GODSPEED.
 WE'LL MISS YOU.
 I'LL MISS YOU GUYS.
 TO HAVE SOMEONE HAVE TO GO
HOME LIKE, THIS IT'S WORSE THAN
A MED EVAC.
IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN
IMAGINE IN "SURVIVOR."
IT'S JUST A REMINDER OF HOW
QUICKLY THIKS CAN CHANGE.
 LET'S BRING THIS HOME FOR
TERRY.
LET'S BRING IT HOME FOR HIM.
 I DON'T LIKE HAVING CHILLS.
 Jeff: HANG IN THERE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU HOME.
 I FEEL FOR HIM.
HE'S A GOOD DAD.
WE'LL KEEP HIM IN OUR THOUGHTS
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND
HOPEFULLY WHEN HE GETS HOME,
IT'S ALL GOOD.
ANGKOR GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW BAYON TRIBE.
MONICA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ANGKOR AND BAYON GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW TA KEO
TRIBE.
 WHAT!
 WITHOUT TERRY.
 Jeff: TERRY DEITZ WAS
PULLED FROM THE GAME DUE TO A
FAMILY EMERGENCY.
 WHAT!
 OH, NO!
 Jeff: HIS WIFE CALLED AND
SAID ONE OF HIS KIDS WAS SICK,
AND THAT HE NEEDED TO GO HOME.
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: SAVAGE, YOU'RE A DAD.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: IMAGINE HEARING THAT
NEWS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ONE
OF YOUR KIDS, AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.
 I'D RUN TO THE AIRPORT.
I MEAN, WE ALL LOVE THIS GAME TO
OUR CORE, BUT THAT'S FAMILY.
THAT'S BIGGER THAN ALL OF THIS.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH, YOU CAN
EXPLAIN TO SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT A
PARENT WHAT IS THAT INSTANT?
YOU HAD IT.
SAVAGE HAD IT.
 YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR
KID.
IF I HAD TO GET THERE ANY
FASTER, I WOULD JUMP AND SWIM
ALL THE WAY TO HIM AND FOR TERRY
TO LEAVE FOR THAT, LIKE, WE ALL
HAVE EMOTION FOR HIM.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
 Jeff: SO, CIERA, YOU ARE A
YOUNG MOM AS WELL.
WHAT COMES UP?
 I HAD THE CONVERSATION WITH
MY HUSBAND, YOU KNOW, LIKE, WHAT
WOULD MAKE ME COME HOME.
AND I DON'T KNOW.
I LOVE THIS GAME, BUT I LOVE MY
FAMILY SO MUCH MORE.
 Jeff: SO, JOE, WHAT DOES
THIS DO TO YOU AS A TRIBE?
 I THINK HALF THE NIGHT IT
TOOK THE WIND OUT OF OUR SAILS A
LITTLE BIT, BUT THERE'S STILL
THE GAME, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO
HIM PROUD.
 Jeff: WHERE ARE WE AT WITH
THE OTHER TWO TRIBES?
BAYON, WHAT'S THE VIBE OF THIS
FIVE RIGHT NOW, JEREMY?
 IT'S A NICE LITTLE FAMILY
GOING ON HERE.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, HAS THIS
TRIBE GOTTEN STRONGER, EVEN
THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
OF ADVERSITY?
 THIS FOUR RIGHT HERE ARE
UNBELIEVABLY TIGHT.
AND WE JUST CAN'T WAIT TO
CONTINUE OUR LITTLE WINNING
STREAK.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO I'M
GLAD TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THREE
VERY TIGHT TRIBES, BECAUSE THE
GREAT THING ABOUT "SURVIVOR," IT
JUST KEEPS MOVING FORWARD.
AND THAT MAKES TODAY A PERFECT
DAY FOR A SWITCH.
 WHAT!
 Jeff: EVERYBODY DROP YOUR
BUFFS.
AGAIN.
 LOVE YOU, TERRY.
 THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORDS IN
THIS WORLD FOR ME, "DROP YOUR
BUFF."
 Jeff: TWO TRIBES WILL BE TA
KEO AND BAYON.
ANGKOR WILL BE NO MORE.
EVERYBODY, OPEN YOUR BUFFS.
 SO I NOTICE THAT SAVAGES THAT
THE SAME COLOR.
I WAS MORE THAN PLEASED BECAUSE
FIHAD TO CHOOSE ONE PERSON I'M
MOST CLOSEST TO, HANDS DOWN,
IT'S GOD GOT TO BE SAVAGE.
 Jeff: TAKE YOUR SPOTS ON
YOUR NEW MATS.
 THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SWAPS
NOW.
THERE ARE SO MANY PAST
RELATIONSHIPS, I CANNOT FATHOM
HOW PEOPLE COULD GROUP TOGETHER.
IT IS A CLUSTER... EXPLETIVE.
 WELCOME HOME!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, KASS, YOU
JUST DROPPED A BUFF AND DREW
ANOTHER TA KEO AND YOU'RE RIGHT
BACK HERE.
 I'M HAPPY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
RICE AND THE CHICKEN, YOU KNOW.
A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT SPENCER
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S
NOT A LOT CONNECTION THERE.
 WOW, WE'RE ALREADY IN IT.
HERE WE GO!
KASS AND I HAVE FEUDED, AND AT
TIMES, WE'VE HATED EACH OTHER.
SO HOW I CAN GET ALONG WITH MY
ARCH NEMESIS IS GOING TO
DETERMINE HOW THIS GAME GOES FOR
ME.
 Jeff: SO WENTWORTH, IN A
NEW GAME OF SEVEN, SIX OF WHOM
WERE TOGETHER IN THE BEGINNING
DO YOU FEEL INSTANTLY I WILL BE
THE ODD ONE OUT?
 I KNOW I'M THE ONLY ORIGINAL
TA KEO.
YOU BE, I KNOW SOME OF THESE
PEOPLE, THOUGH, FROM WORKING
TOGETHER ON THE LAST TRIBE SO
I'M EXCITED.
AND I JUST WANT TO WIN.
 THE SWITCH WORKED OUT
PERFECTLY FOR ME FOR RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE AN OBVIOUS TARGET WITH
WENTWORTH, BUT I STILL HAVE A
SENSE OF BEING AT RISK BECAUSE
THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG ALPHA
GUYS HERE.
THAT'S TERRIFYING TO ME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
READY TO GET TO YOUR FIRST
REWARD CHALLENGE AS NEW TRIBES?
 YES!
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, ONE MEMBER FROM EACH
TRIBE WILL RACE DOWN A SLIPPERY
COURSE, GRABBING A RING ALONG
THE WAY.
YOU'LL THEN TOSS THAT RING
ATTEMPTING TO LAND IT ON A POST.
FIRST TO GET IT RIGHT, SCORES A
POINT.
FIRST TRIBE TO THREE WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES!
 Jeff: IT WILL BE A NICE WAY
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
A "SURVIVOR" PICNIC DELIVERED TO
YOUR CAMP.
FRIED CHICKEN.
 OH!
 Jeff: MAC AND CHEESE.
AND FOR DESSERT, BROWNIES!
 OH!
 OH, GIRL, GIRL!
 Jeff: I'LL GIVE YOU A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
FIRST UP, TA KEO, WHO YOU GOT?
IT IS GOING TO BE SAVAGE TAKING
ON JEREMY IN THIS FIRST ROUND.
FIRST ONE TO GET THEIR RING ON
THE POST SCORES A POINT.
WE ARE PLAYING TO THREE.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
JEREMY LAUNCHES.
SAVAGE LAUNCHS.
JEREMY'S GOT THE RING, SAVAGE
RIGHT BEHIND.
JEREMY SCORES OVER SAVAGE, AND
SAVAGE LESS THAN A HALF A SECOND
BEHIND.
 THAT'S CRAZY.
 Jeff: THAT IS AS CLOSE AS
IT CAN GET.
BAYON LEADS 1-ZIP.
NEXT MATCH-UP.
IT WILL BE KASS VERSUS FISHPACK.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 GSTEPHEN, GO, GO, GO!
GET UP, STEPHEN, GET UP,
STEPHEN.
GO, GO, GO!
MOVE THOSE FEET!
 Jeff: KASS NOT MESSING
AROUND.
SHE HAS HER RING.
STEPHEN HAS HIS.
 COME ON, STEPHEN!
 Jeff: KASS ALMOST SCORES?

 STEVE, RELAX, MAN!
FISHBACK CAN HE DO IT RIGHT
HERE?
 THROW IT AT THE POST,
STEPHEN, THROW IT AT IT.
 STOP FLIPPING IT!
 Jeff: KASS CAN TIE IT RIGHT
HERE.
AND SHE DOES!
WE ARE TIED 1-1.
 HEY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.
WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU, HAVE
IT IN YOURSELF, MAN!
COME ON!
 Jeff: NEXT MATCH-UP, IT IS
ABI FOR TA KEO, KIMMI FOR BAYON.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: BEATING WOMEN COME UP
SHORT.
KIMMI GOING TO TRY TO WALK IT.
THAT IS NOT EASY TO DO.
 GRAB THE RING!
 Jeff: KIMMI HAS A RING.
ABI HAS HERS.
KIM WEA TOSS.
KIMMI ON AND OFF.
NO, NO, NO!
KEEP GOING!
ABI THOUGHT IT WAS OVER.
ABI CAN PUT TA KEO IN THE LEAD.
TA KEO LEADS 2-1.
NEXT ROUND, IT IS GOING TO BE
WOO.
 ALL RIGHT, WOO!
 Jeff: VERSUS JOE.
JOE MUST SCORE TO KEEP BAYON
ALIVE.
 BIG JOE!
 Jeff: SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
WOO LAUNCHES.
JOE LAUNCHES.
BOTH GUYS GET TO THE RING
QUICKLY, BAYON SCORES!
WE ARE TIED AND GO TO SUDDEN
DEATH DOWN TO A SHOWDOWN!
 ONE SHOT!
 Jeff: AND IT COMES DOWN TO
THIS.
WIGLESWORTH VERSUS WENTWORTH.
WHOEVER SCORES HERE WINS FOR
THEIR TRIBE FRIED CHICKEN, MAC
AND CHEESE.
HERE WE GO, FOR THE WIN,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
WENTWORTH LAUNCHES, COMES UP

BOTH WOMEN ON THEIR FEET.
FIRST RING WINS FOR THEIR TRIBE.
 ALMOST!
 THROW IT!
THROW IT!
 SHE'S GOT IT.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH FOR THE
WIN.
NO, IT BOUNCES ON AND OFF.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH CAN WIN
IT.
WIGLESWORTH WINS IT FOR TA KEO!
HUGE REWARD.
TA KEO, BIG REWARD, "SURVIVOR"
PICNIC DELIVERED TO YOUR CAM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
BUT THRIT SITTHERE AND ENJOY IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK.
ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.
 THANK YOU, JEFF!
 Jeff: BAYON, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 LOOKING AT THE COMPLEXION OF
MY TRIBE, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
I GOT ABI AND WOO, AFTER WE WENT
THROUGH IN ANGKOR, WE'RE ROCK
SOLID.
AND IF I CAN JUST REGROUP WITH
MY BAYON FOLKS, KASS AND CIERA,
THAT'S THE MOST PERFECT EQUATION
YOU CAN IMAGINE.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
 OH, MY GOSH!
LET'S GET TO IT!
THOSE BROWNI BROWNIES ARE BIGGER
THAN OUR FISTS!
 WELL DONE, EVERYONE.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
 COMING INTO THE NEW TA KEO
TRIBE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE
AWESOME MEAL I WAS ABOUT TO EAT
BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND KIND
OF NAGGING AT ME WAS HOW THE
HELL IS THIS TRIBE GOING TO WORK
OUT FOR ME?
HOW WAS TA KEO THE LAST, LIKE,
COUPLE ROUNDS?
 WE WERE CHILL BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, BUT THE
FOUR OF US THAT CAME OVER WERE,
LIKE, THE LEAST DRAMATIC,
NONSCHEMERS.
 I CAN BELIEVE THAT.
WHEN KASS AND I HAD TO ACTUALLY
DO THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE AND
INTERACT, IT WAS A LITTLE
AWKWARD.
IT WAS A LITTLE CAGEY.
CAN I GET A WATERMELON?
 YOU CAN HAVE ABOUT 10.
 GENUINELY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO MAKE OF IT.
SO I JUST TRIED TO TREAT HER
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, BUT THAT'S
NEVER WORKED FOR ME IN THE PAST
WITH KASS.
 DUDE, DO YOU REALIZE WE'RE
HERE?
WE'RE OUT OF THAT HELL HOLE.
NO, I CAN'T TELL YOU GUYS HOW
HARD THAT WAS.
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH IN ANGKOR
WAS SO TRAUMATIZING THAT HAVING
THAT VICTORY AND THE FOOD WAS
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
MOMENTS IN MY LIFE, HONESTLY.
IT SOUNDS SILLY, ABSOLUTELY
BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.
 TA KEO!
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
 SO AS SOON AS I LOOKED AT
THOSE OTHER SIX, FIRST THING I
THOUGHT WAS I GOT FIVE.
TWO OF THE OLD BAYON WITH KASS
AND CIERA, AND I GOT MY ANGKORS.
 BE CAREFUL RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
 SPENCER'S THIS WONDERFUL KID,
HONESTLY, IF I HAD A SON, I'D
LIKE HIM TO BE LIKE SPENCER.
BIG HEART, SUPER BRIGHT.
I LOVE THE KID, BUT I'LL TELL
YOU THIS, AND IT SOUNDS REALLY
COLD, I KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE
KASS CAN'T STAND SPENCER, AND
AND I AM GOING TO USE THAT TO MY
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 CIERA AND I ARE PRETTY TIGHT.
 SO, ME, WOO, AND ABI
INSEPARABLE.
SO WE HAVE US THREE.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.
 AWESOME.
 I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
 AS LONG AS WE KEEP OUR BAYON.
 SPENCER'S GOT TO GO.
 YEAH.
I WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF
SPENCER AGAIN.
I DIDN'T WANT SPENCER ON MY
TRIBE.
I WANTED TO PLAY SECOND CHANCES
WITHOUT THE BLEDSOE.
 THAT'S IT, PERFECT.
 HERE'S WHAT WE WERE THINKING
IS WE TELL SPENCER CIERA'S
GOING, AND IT'S GOING TO BE 100%
BLINDSIDE.
HE'LL HAVE NO IDEA.
 SAVAGE SAYS, "WE'RE GOING TO
SEND SPENCER HOME AND TELL HIM
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ME TO GO
HOME."
ME?
LIKE, HOLD THE PHONE.
IT SHOWS A HUGE CIPE OF WHERE
HIS TRUST LIES THAT HE WOULD
RATHER THROW ME UNDER THE BUS
THAN, YOU KNOW, WOO IS NOT
ORIGINAL BAYON.
 SO YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
 I TRUST YOU.
 LET'S NOT SCRAMBLE.
WE'RE GOOD, FIVE, RIGHT HERE.
 WHENEVER YOU HEAR YOUR NAME
BEING BROUGHT UP, IT IS NEVER A
GOOD THING.
I WANT TO BE A TEAM PLAYER.
THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES I'M
WILLING TO TAKE THINGS FOR THE
TEAM.
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES.
 ONE, TWO, THREE, TA KEO.
 HERE.
 DON'T DROP IT IN THERE.
 I WON'T DROP IT IN THERE!
 I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T CATCH IT ON FIRE, EITHER.
 OH, SON OF A-- OKAY.
 OH, YOU'RE DONE.
YOU'RE DONE.
 HOW DID THEY BURN OFF?
 OH, MY GOODNESS, JOE.
 I KNOW.
WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME WORK.
BECAUSE YOU'RE TA KEO.
 I KNOW.
I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE HERE.
 YOU'RE THE EASY VOTE.
 NO, I KNOW.
 SO, I KNOW.
 WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP
YOU HERE.
AFTER THE TRIBE SWAP,
STRATEGICALLY I'M IN A GOOD
SPOT.
I'VE GOT AN ORIGINAL ALLIANCE OF
BAYON, AND OVER AT THE TA KEO
CAMP MYSELF, KASS, CIERA, KELLY,
AND KEITH ALL KIND OF MADE A
PACT, SO I WANT TO KEEP KELLEY
AROUND SO I HAVE NUMBERS AT THE
MERGE.
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN STEVEN AND
KIMMI.
 I KNOW.
 THAT'S THE ONE BIGGEST PITCH,
I THINK.
 FOR SURE.
 I KNOW I'M THE EASY VOTE.
LIKE, I'M NOT OBLIVIOUS TO IT.
BUT I DO HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL,
AND IF JOE WANTS TO PROTECT ME,
LIKE, I'M GOING TO HIDE BEHIND
HIM AS LONG AS I CAN.
I MEAN, JOE, THANK YOU.
 WHAT ARE WE DOING?
ARE WE JUST STICKING TOGETHER?
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO?
 ARE YOU GOOD WITH WENTWORTH?
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO
LOSE, TO BE HONEST.
 DO WE TRY TO GO STRONG?
I MEAN, LIKE, I LOVE KIMMI, BUT,
CHALLENGE-- I MEAN, I'M JUST
SAYING, LIKE, JUST IN TERMS OF
LIKE A FIRST VOTE.
 YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE BAYON
STRONG.
WHY WOULD WE SCREW IT UP NOW?
THE OLD BAYON IS SAYING LET'S
KEEP BAYON TOGETHER.
JOE IS SAYING NO, LET'S KEEP
WENTWORTH AND TARGET KIMMI.
HE IS ALREADY TRYING TO GET OUR
CORE ALLIANCE TO TURN ON EACH
OTHER.
JOE SAID KIMMI.
 I DON'T LIKE THAT.
 NO, OF COURSE, NOT.
 SO JOE ACTUALLY FLIPPED ON
THE BAYON ALLIANCE, AND THIS IS
"SURVIVOR."
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION.
I DON'T TRUST JOE AT ALL.
SO, LIKE, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO
LOSE HIM, LIKE, IMMEDIATELY.
 BUT I-- I DON'T WANT TO DO
JOE FIRST.
STEVE IS DEFINITELY DIGGING HIS
HEELS IN HE WANTS JOE OUT.
BUT I NEED A SHIELD.
I NEED JOE AROUND AS LONG AS
POSSIBLE.
I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE BIGGEST
GUY OUT HERE.
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TALK.
WE'LL TALK.
YOU KNOW, AT THE REWARD
CHALLENGE, JEREMY'S LIKE, MAN,
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE.
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIKE, I'M PUTTING EVERYTHING
INTO WINNING "SURVIVOR."
THAT DOESN'T MANIFEST ITSELF IN
CHALLENGES.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD IN THOSE.
YOU'RE BUGGING.
 JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
LET IT PERCOLATE.
I'M GOOD AT OTHER THINGS.
IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGIC MOVES,
THAT TO ME IS WHAT THIS GAME IS
ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT THE SOCIAL STRATEGY.
IT'S ABOUT BUILDING ALLIANCES
AND MAINTAINING ALLIANCES AND
TARGETING THE RIGHT PERSON AT
THE RIGHT TIME.
HE'S, LIKE, TRYING TO GET US OUT
TO SAVE WENTWORTH, SO HE'S NOT
BAYON'S FRIEND.
 RIGHT.
IT WOULD BE UNEXPECTED--
 YOU THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH, TOO SOON.
 YEAH.
 FICAN'T GET MY ALLIANCE TO
MAKE THAT MOVE WITH ME, I HAVE
FAILED.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU DON'T GET A
LOT OF SHOTS TAKING OUT YOUR
MAJOR COMPETITION AND, YOU KNOW,
WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS ME UP...
IS-- OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GETTING
TEARY.
IS THE IDEA THAT, LIKE, YOU
KNOW, I WOULD MISS THIS-- OH, MY
GOD.
THIS IS SO SILLY.
THAT I WOULD MISS THE SECOND
CHANCE.
I WOULD MISS MY-- YOU KNOW, I'VE
PUT SO MUCH INTO IT LAST TIME,
BUT I STILL CAME UP SHORT.
AND I'M PUTTING SO MUCH INTO IT
THIS TIME.
AND THE IDEA THAT I WOULD COME
UP SHORT BECAUSE I JUST COULDN'T
GET MY CREW TO TAKE THE SHOT
THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE.
LIKE, I'VE BEEN KICKING MYSELF
FOR SO MANY YEARS JUST FOR NOT
GETTING RILD OF THE GOLDEN BOY
LAST TIME.
BUT TO JUST WAIT FOR THE GAME TO
COME TO YOU AND PASS YOU BY,
THAT WOULD BE A REAL LOSS TO ME,
TO NOT TAKE CONTROL OF THE GAME
WHEN WE HAVE THE CHANCE.
GOD, IT WOULD BE SUCH A GREAT
MOVE.
IT WOULD BE SUCH A GREAT MOVE.
THIS WOULD BE THE MOVE THAT SET
THE TENOR FOR THE WHOLE SEASON.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
 YES!
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CIERA.
TAKE BACK THE IDOL.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
TODAY YOU WILL PARTICIPATE IN A
FOOD-EATING COMPETITION.
YOU WILL RACE TO GET DOWN LOCAL
CAMBODIAN DELICACIES.
FIRST TO DO SO SCORES A POINT
FOR THEIR TRIBE.
FIRST TO FOUR WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, LOSERS GO TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
WE HAVE DONE THIS CHALLENGE 14
TIMES.
KELLY YOU ARE THE ORIGINATOR OF
THIS.
KIMMI DID THIS IN SEASON TWO,
AND COULDN'T GET DOWN THE COW'S
BRAIN.
CIERA PARTICIPATED AND DIDN'T
EVEN GET OUT OF THE FIRST ROUND.
EACH TRIBE FOR THE FIRST ROUND
WILL PUT UP TWO TRIBE MEMBERS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
FIRST ROUND.
KIMMI AND TASHA TAKING ON WOO
AND SPENCER.
GO AHEAD AND REVEAL.
 OH, KIMMI.
OH, MY GOD.
 IS IT ALIVE?

 Jeff: SO EVERYBODY HAS TWO
TARANTULAS TO GET DOWN.
THE FIRST PAIR TO FINISH SCORES
A POINT.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
EMPTY MOUTH.
 SWALLOW IT.
 GOOD JOB, TASHA.
 Jeff: THERE WILL BE A
LITTLE BIT OF GUTS IN THERE.
A LITTLE BIT OF JUICE.

TRAPTULAS IN THEIR MOUTH EXCEPT

SECOND.
SAVAGE IS GOOD.
JEREMY'S GOOD.
 COME ON, KEITH!
COME ON, KEITH!
 Jeff: IT'S NOW DOWN TO
CIERA VERSUS KEITH FOR THE

WOULD BE A HUGE REDEMPTION FOR
CIERA.

BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT LEFT.
KASS SPITTING IT BACK UP NOW.

 Jeff: BAYON LEADSES, 2-1.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
KELLY IS SHOVING IT IN HER
MOUTH.
 TAKE YOUR TIME, JOE.
 Jeff: JOE GOING PIECE BY
PIECE, TWO VERY DIFFERENT
STRATEGIES.
KELLY COULD TIE IT UP RIGHT
HERE.
 YOU GOT THIS, KELLY.
 Jeff: KELLY DOES IT FOR TA
KEO.
DEFEET JOE.
WE ARE TIED 2-2.
NEXT ROUND, WOO, KIMMI, GO AHEAD
AND REVEAL.
PIGS BRAIN.
 I HAVEN'T HAD PIG IN 30
YEARS.
I-- AND TO GO JUMP INTO PIG
BRAIN IS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME,
SO MY GIFT IS TO LET WOO EAT
SOME PIG BRAIN.
 Jeff: HERE WE GO, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO.
 BON APPETITE.
 CHEERS.
 BRAINS!
 Jeff: WOW.
WOO MAKING THIS LOOK EASY.
THAT WAS LESS THAN FIVE
SECONDSES.
( APPLAUSE )
TA KEO LEADS 3-2.
NEXT ROUND.
CIERA, WENTWORTH.
REVEAL.
SCORPION.
SO, CIERA, IF YOU WIN HERE, YOU
WIN THE CHALLENGE FOR TA KEO.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: IF YOU LOSE, WE ARE
TIED 3-3.
BIG PRESSURE.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
 GO, CIERA.
GO, CIERA.
GET IT, GET IT!
 Jeff: CIERA COULD WIN IT
FOR HER TRIBE, WOULD BE AN
AMAZING SECOND-CHANCE STORY.
 SWALLOW, SWALLOW, SWALLOW.
WENTWORTH WOULD TIE IT UP FOR
BAYON.
EXTENDING THIS ONE MORE ROUND.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.
WENTWORTH SCORES FOR BAYON!
CIERA ONCE AGAIN COMES UP SHORT.
WE ARE TIED 3-3.
SO, CIERA, WHAT ARE THE TEARS
FOR?
 I FEEL BAD FOR LETTING THESE
GUYS DOWN.
 YOU DID NOT LET US DOWN.
 I'M PROUD OF MYSELF FOR EVEN
GETTING AS FAR AS I GOT.
 Jeff: KASS VERSUS TASHA.
LAST ITEM.
REVEAL.
BELUTE.
 OH, GOD, THAT'S BRUTAL.
 Jeff: DUCK EMBRYO.
THIS IS IT FOR THE WIN, THE
FIRST TO FINISH SENDS THE OTHER
TRIBE TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GIANT STAKES.
HAND ON THE TABLE UNTIL I SIGH
GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
SHELL IS AND ALL.
 KASS IS GOING TO PUKE.
 Jeff: KASS REALLY
STRUGGLING WITH JUST A BABY
BITE.
COMING BACK UP.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.
ALL OF IT CAME UP.
 COME ON, BABY GIRL!
 COME ON, GIRL!
 Jeff: BAYON WINS IMMUNITY,
SYNDING TA KEO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.
 GOOD JOB, GIRL.
 Jeff: KASS ARE THE TEARS A
PHYSICAL REACTION TO JUST IT
GOING DOWN OR IS THAT AN
EMOTIONAL REACTION?
 I THINK IT'S BOTH.
YOU KNOW, I WAS KIND OF VOMITUS
WHICH MAKES YOU A LITTLE TEARY.
AND THEN LETTING THE TRIBE DOWN.
 Jeff: BAYON, IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.
WELL EARNED.
 GOOD JOB, TASH.
 Jeff: NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR
BAYON.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, ENJOY THE
NIGHT OFF.
 OH, WE WILL.
NICE JOB, GUYS.
 Jeff: WOW, REALLY?
 I HAVEN'T EATEN IN 16 DAYS,
JEFF!
 Jeff: TA KEO GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU BUT A DATE WITH ME
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT AND I
WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF SPENCER
AGAIN AND IF HE WAS THE FIRST
PERSON WHOSE NAME I WROTE DOWN,
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WRITE
A SAD FACE ON HIS CARD AND SEND
HIM ON HIS WAY.
SPENCER BLEDSOE, 0% CHANCE OF
WINNING THIS GAME.
 WE LOST THE CHALLENGE AND NOW
WE'VE GOT TO FACE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT WHO WE
WANTED TO TAKE OUT IF WE ENDED
UP AT TRIBAL.
SO AS OF NOW, IF EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO PLAN, WE'RE ALL
GOING TO VOTE SPENCER.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS THE PLAN.
 WE'RE LOCKED.
 OKAY.
 EVERYBODY'S GOTTA SAY CIERA.
 OKAY, OKAY.
 SO EVERYONE IS SAYING CIERA.
 BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.
 DON'T STRESS IT.
 IF HE ASKS ME I'LL JUST SAY I
DON'T KNOW.
 GUYS, DON'T BE SEEN TALKING
TO CIERA.
 TO COME HERE AT TA KEO AND BE
AMONGST THE MAJORITY OF THE
ALLIANCE, I'M FINALLY IN TUNE
WITH THIS GAME, AND I GET TO--
GET TO PLAY.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
HAPPENING TONIGHT?
 HERE'S MY THING, I THINK
CIERA'S GOTTA GO.
 I AM KIND OF ON THE OUTS AS
FAR AS BEING IN THE KNOW.
BUT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO PLAY
WITH SAVAGE THIS WHOLE TIME.
I THINK HE'S JUST A REALLY GOOD
GUY AND SOMEONE THAT I CAN
TRUST.
 YEAH.
 WOO KNOWS, KASS KNOWS, ABI
KNOWS, I KNOW, NOW YOU KNOW.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY HARD FOR ME TO
PUT UP SPENCER LIKE THIS.
HE'S A GREAT KID, BUT NOTHING'S
GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY SECOND
CHANCE.
SO TONIGHT EVERYONE'S VOTING
SPENCER.
HE'S VOTING CIERA.
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT, MAN.
THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE
MOST DEVASTATING, UNEXPECTED
BLINDSIDES IN THE HISTORY OF
SURVIVOR.
I MEAN BUSINESS.
THIS IS MY SECOND CHANCE.
I'M NOTE GETTING A THIRD CHANCE.
THIS IS IT.
 HERE'S MY THING, I DON'T FEEL
WITH MY NAME BEING THE ONE
THROWN OUT.
WHO DOES SAFFABLE THINK HE IS--
 IT WAS WEIRD, HE'S LIKE,
"WE'RE GOING TO SAY CIERA."
I WAS LIKE WHERE DOES THIS COME
FROM.
 HE WAS ALL BAYON STRONG AND
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAS WOO,
AND THAT FREAKS ME OUT.
 I DEFINITELY HAD A WAKE-UP
CALL WHEN TERRY WENT HOME.
IT IS MY SECOND CHANCE.
IT COULD BE MY LAST CHANCE AND I
WANT TO GO FOR IT FULL ON SO I
CAN GO HOME TO MY FAMILY AND
SAY, "HEY, I GAVE IT MY ALL."
 I WOULD LIKE TO GET RID OF
SPENCER BEFORE THE MERGE.
 I THINK WE WOULD BE REALLY
DUMB TO KEEP WOO OVER SPENCER.
 SO CIERA WANTS TO GET RID OF
WOO.
I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY WITH
SPENCER.
I WAS GLAD NOT TO BE ON A TRIBE
WITH HIM ALL THIS TIME.
AND WHEN EVERYONE SAID LET'S DO
SPENCER FIRST, IT WAS ALMOST
BEING SERVED UP TO ME.
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO STEP BACK.
IS THERE A BETTER USE FOR
SPENCER RIGHT NOW?
 WE SHOULD TALK.
 I DON'T WANT TO REHASH ANY OF
THAT STUFF.
 NO.
 BUT I DO THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD TO TALK THROUGH EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW.
 YEAH, THERE'S SOME STUFF
GOING ON, AND--
 YEAH.
 THERE'S SOME STUFF THAT COULD
BENEFIT YOU, BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE KIND OF NOT IN ANYTHING.
 I REALLY LIKE SAVAGE.
 INTERESTINGLY, SAVAGE SAID,
"WHY DON'T WE GO FOR SPENCER,
BUT WE'LL TELL THEM IT'S CIERA."
 DOES SAVAGE ACTUALLY WANT TO
GO AFTER ME?
 YEAH.
 HUH.
WHEN DID HE SAY THAT?
 LIKE, AFTER THE FEAST.
JUST SITTING IN THE SHELTER.
 IF WHAT KASS IS SAYING IS
TRUE, THAT SAVAGE IS CONSIDERING
ME AS A TARGET, I'M LEFT HAVING
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO RUN.
 I'M LEANING TOWARDS A WOO
BLINDSIDE, AND IF WE HAVE TO--
 DO YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE A
GOOD GROUP TO DO IT.
 CIERA, ABI, ME AND YOU, AND
THAT'S FOUR.
 I GUESS I'M BUNKING WITH THE
DEVIL TONIGHT.
I MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY WITH KASS.
 I'LL FINALLY GET MY REVENGE
ON SPENCER BLEDSOE.
THERE'S TWO IDEAS FLOATING OUT
THERE, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH AND
WOO THINK SPENCE SER GOING HOME,
AND SPENCER ABI, AND CIERA
BELIEVE WOO IS GOING HOME.
 WE'RE ALL GOOD, RIGHT?
 I'M NOT WAVERING FROM THAT AT
ALL.
 I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
ANYTHING ELSE.
WE'RE SO STRONG WITH JUST US.
 I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
WRITE DOWN SPENCER AND SAY
GOOD-BYE.
AS I SIT HERE RIGHT NOW, I COULD
STILL DO THAT IF I WANTED TO
BECAUSE OF HOW THE VOTES ARE.
IT'S MY FIRST TRIBAL OF MY
SECOND CHANCE.
WHICH KASS IS COMING?
IS IT CALM KASS OR IS IT CHAOS
KASS?
THE LITTLE ANGEL AND THE DEVIL.
THEY'RE EACH ON MY SHOULDER.
SPENCER, WOO.
CALM, CHAOS.
IT'S THERE.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
 Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
HAVE NOT BEEN TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
YET, GRAB A TORCH, DIP IT IN,
AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE FIRE
REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
ALL RIGHT, SO 16 DAYS IN TO THIS
SECOND CHANCE EXPERIMENT.
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS, A
CHANCE TO SEE IF YOU CAN CHANGE
THE WAY YOU PLAYED THE FIRST
TIME AND GET A BETTER RESULT.
SAVAGE, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
WORKING ON?
 MY PERSONAL GAME.
DEVELOPING DEEP, DEEP
RELATIONSHIPS, BEGAN WITH
IDENTIFYING FOLKS WHO ACTUALLY
WERE TRUST WORTHY AND LOYAL, AND
I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY WELL
DOING THAT.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHAT'S YOUR
SECOND CHANCE SEASON BEEN ABOUT
SO FAR?
 IT'S BEEN ABOUT COMING INTO
THIS GAME AND SEEING PEOPLE AS
THAT, PEOPLE.
 Jeff: WHICH IS TOUGH TO DO
IN A GAME THAT IS OUTWIT,
OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.
 ABSOLUTELY.
THIS MIGHT BE THE HARDEST
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO DO AND
YET THE MOST IMPORTANT.
 Jeff: WOO, SOME WOULD SAY
THAT WHAT HURT YOU THE FIRST
TIME YOU PLAYED IS YOU WEREN'T
ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE TONY
MANIPULATING YOU INTO A
MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE.
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
MY FIRST SEASON, WHAT I FAILED
IN WAS UNDERSTANDING THAT TO
SUCCEED IN THIS GAME, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE
CUT THROAT, AND I'M AT PEACE
WITH THAT.
 Jeff: SO, KASS, THERE'S ALL
THESE SECOND CHANCE STORIES BUT
YOU'RE STILL PLAYING A GAME.
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE ALL OF THE
MANY LAYERS OF RELATIONSHIPS?
 YEAH, IT'S REALLY HARD TO
KEEP TRACK.
I WAS ON BAYON EARLY WITH
SAVAGE.
ARE WE STILL BAYON STRONG?
WOO I KNOW FROM CAGYAN, SPENCER,
YOU KNOW.
CIERA AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
FROM DAY ONE.
WHO WHO'S REALLY TIGHT WITH WHO
AND WHY?
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
 Jeff: NOW THAT CHAOS KASS
OR THE NEW KASS?
 I DON'T KNOW WHICH KASS IS
HERE TONIGHT.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, THAT'S GOT TO
BE A LITTLE UNNERVING.
YOU KNOW WHEN CHAOS KASS IS
ANGRY OR SHE'S TELLING YOU TRUTH
OR SHE'S ABOUT TO BLINDSIDE YOU.
 I'VE BEEN WITH KASS A LONG
TIME, ORIGINAL BAYON, AND I
HAVEN'T SEEN CHAOS KASS YET.
I HAVE SEEN A LOVING, LOYAL
KASS.
 Jeff: CIERA, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE ON ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS
THAT ARE OUT HERE?
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THEM?
 NAVIGATING PEOPLE IS ACTUALLY
ONE OF MY STRENGTHS.
I MEET SOMEBODY AND I GO WITH MY
GUT AND I KNOW.
LIKE, SAVAGE WAS WITH ME
EARLIER, BUT HE GREW TIGHT WITH
WOO.
UN, IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT THAT
BATTLE BETWEEN YOUR GUT AND YOUR
HEART, AND YOUR MIND.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, DO YOU GET
UNCOMFORTABLE ANY TIME YOU MORE
YOUR NAME MENTIONED IN ANY
SENTENCE FOR ANY REASON AT
TRIBAL?
 NO.
 Jeff: AND WHY IS THAT?
 BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE DOUBTS
ABOUT TONIGHT.
MY JUDGMENT IS MY JUDGMENT.
IF I BLOW IT, THAT'S ON ME.
 Jeff: AND, CIERA, WHEN YOU
HEAR WHAT SAVAGE SAID, ," I FEEL
PRETTY CONFIDENT," THAT'S THE
FUN PART OF "SURVIVOR," IF
EVERYBODY IS PLAYING AT THE
HIGHEST LEVEL, EVERYBODY HERE
FEELS CONFIDENT.
AND YET, SOMEBODY WILL GO HOME.
 THAT'S THE SCARIEST PART OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL SECOND-TIME
PLAYERS AND WE ALL HAVE PLANS.
AND SOMEBODY'S PLAN IS NOT GOING
TO WORK OUT.
 Jeff: SPENCER, THAT'S
REALLY IT.
SOMEBODY'S PLAN IS NOT GOING TO
WORK OUT.
 YEAH.
EVERYONE HAS SOME DEGREE OF
CONFIDENCE, AND NOT EVERYONE CAN
KEEP THAT CONFIDENCE ONCE YOU
GET OUT THE SNUFFER.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
WIGLESWORTH, YOU'RE UP.
 I'M WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN
FOR ONE REASON-- ARE YOU TOO
GOOD AT THIS GAME.
 MY FATE TONIGHT LIES IN THE
HANDS OF CHAOS KASS.
( SIGHS )
GOD HELP ME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, SPENTER.
WOO.
SPENCER.
SPENCER.
THREE VOTES SPENCER, ONE VOTE
WOO.
WOO.
THAT'S TWO VOTES WOO.
WOO.
WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES WOO,
THREE VOTES SPENCER, ONE VOTE
LEFT.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE," WOO.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 BLINDSIDE.
 Jeff: WOO, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME TO GO.
 Jeff: WELL, THIS SEASON THE
GAME IS BEING PLAYED AT A VERY
HIGH LEVEL, WHICH MEANS ARE YOU
GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO
ADAPT YOUR GAME IF YOU WANT TO
MAKE IT TO THE END.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 SURELY A DIFFICULT WAY TO
LEAVE THE GAME, BUT I HAD AN
AMAZING RUN.
THIS GAME IS THE TOUGHEST, BOTH
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
SO WIN OR LOSE, IT WAS AN
ACHIEVEMENT OF A LIFETIME, AND
I'M STOKED TO BE A PART OF THIS
"SURVIVOR" FAMILY.

Media Access Group at WGBH
 JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR": THE MECIALG IS
COMING.
 CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE
MERGED.
 NOW THE GAME IS ON.
ONCE YOU MAKE THE MERGE, THINGS
ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE.
 Jeff: AND CHAOS KASS IT
BACK.
 HERE'S THE LINE.
IT'S BEEN DRAWN.
PEOPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHO
THEY'RE WORKING WITH AND THE
MIMGZ THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN.
DON'T MESS WITH MY SECOND
CHANCE.
YOU UNLEASHED THE BEAST.
 I WHEN JEFF WOKE ME UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, GETTING
HOME TO MY FAMILY WAS THE ONLY
THING I COULD THINK ABOUT.
IT TURNS OUT MY SON DANNY NEEDED
A HEART TRANSPLANT AND HE GOT
THAT TRANSPLANT AND HE'S DOING
WELL.
HERE I WAS THINKING I WAS THE
SECOND WHIC-CHANCE GUY.
HERE'S THE SECOND-CHANCE GUY
RIGHT HERE.
