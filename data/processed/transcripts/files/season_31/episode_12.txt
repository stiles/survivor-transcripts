         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, JOE GAVE IT HIS ALL
AND LOST.
 IS HE OKAY?
 Jeff: MEDICAL.
MEDICAL!
AFTER COLLAPSING, JOE WAS
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE IN THE
GAME.
 EVERY VOTE ABI IS NOT VOTED








OUT, SHE BECOMES MORE AND MORE
DANGEROUS TO MAKE IT TO THE END.
 Jeff: BUT THE WOMEN WANTED
THE BIGGEST THREAT OUT.
 JOE CAN SAY, I'M CLEARLY THE
BIGGEST THREAT AND I'M STILL
HERE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
 Jeff: FEARING AN
ALL-WOMEN'S ALLIANCE, JEREMY AND
SPENCER HAD A DIFFICULT
DECISION.
 IF WE KEEP JOE, I'M
TERRIFIED.








IF WE GET RID OF JOE, I'M
TERRIFIED.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
KEITH WAS LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP
WHEN JEREMY AND SPENCER VOTED
WITH THE WOMEN, SENDING JOE TO
THE JURY.
 Jeff: JOE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
WITH THE NUMBER DWINDLING AND
ALLIANCES IN SHORT SUPPLY,
UNCERTAINTY IS AT AN ALL-TIME
HIGH.
SEVEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 GOOD TRIBAL.
 TRIBAL TONIGHT WAS DEFINITELY
A SPECTACLE.
JOE GOT VOTED OUT.
 IT'S BETTER.
 PAYBACK'S A BITCH.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYBODY HAS
MUCH COMPASSION TOWARD JOE AT
THE MOMENT, AND EVERYBODY'S VERY
GLAD THAT HE HAS GONE HOME
PACKING.
YOU KNOW WHAT, GOOD RIDDANCE.
 NOW WE ALL HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT
AT WINNING CHALLENGES.
 HOW WONDERFUL.
 THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
 YEAH, THAT'S EXCITING.
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
WE CAN TOTALLY WIN CHALLENGES
NOW.
 I WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED.
I MEAN, I WAS LEFT OUT OF THE
LOOP.
THEY SENT JOE TO THE HOUSE.
IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO IT, THAT
WAS A GOOD TIME TO DO IT.
I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
IT.
I WANTED TO GET TASHA OUT OF
THERE.
I NEED TO GET DOWN THERE AND
TALK TO SOME FOLKS.
 WHAT WERE THE VOTES?
ONE TASHA, TWO ABI, FIVE FOR
HIM.
 KEITH DECIDED TO VOTE FOR ME,
SO I'M GOING THE MAKE SURE I
KEEP MY EYE ON KEITH BECAUSE
HE'S THE LAST PERSON I WANT THE
GUYS TO JOIN FORCES WITH OR SOME
OF THE GIRLS.
KEITH JUST PUT TARGET ON HIS
BACK.
 DAY 33, KID.
 GOOD JOB, BABY.
 WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK IT,
THREE TA KEO ORIGINALS.
WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK IT?
MAN.
 I'M KIND OF GLAD, THOUGH.
 THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE, SO
EVERY DECISION FROM HERE ON OUT
COULD AFFECT YOUR END GAME.
SO I'M NOT CLOSED OFF TO
ANYTHING.
I HAVE TO KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN,
WHICH IS WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO
THE ENTIRE GAME.
IT'S A GOOD POSITION TO BE NEW
YORK BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF
STRESSFUL, BECAUSE WHAT IS THE
RIGHT CHOICE.
I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.
 MAIL.
 DEEPLY CONCERNED.
I HAVE EXTREME BUYERS REMORSE.
 YOU THINK 100% WE'RE IN
TROUBLE?
 I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
I THINK WE ARE IN TROUBLE.
 THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
TOOK OUT A CHALLENGE PIECE, I
TOOK OUT JOE.
NOW I HAVE TO HOPE THERE IS A
GROUP OF FOUR FOR ME, WHICH IS
THE NEW MAGIC NUMBER WITH SEVEN
LEFT.
 I'M WORRIED ABOUT TASHA.
 ME TOO.
 THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TASHA IS
WITH US, BECAUSE IF SHE'S NOT,
SHE'S DONE.
THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE KIMMI
IS WITH US.
IF SHE'S NOT, WE'RE DONE.
JEREMY AND I REALIZE THERE VERY
WELL MIGHT BE A GIRL'S ALLIANCE
THAT COULD TAKE US OUT, EVEN
THOUGH TASHA TOLD ME HONESTLY MY
IDEAL FINAL THREE IS YOU AND
JEREMY.
BUT IF THE GIRLS' THING IS REAL,
I HAVE NO OPTION, AND I DON'T
WANT TO PLAY FROM THE BOTTOM
AGAIN.
IT'S EXHAUSTING.
IT'S DEMORALIZING.
I FEEL MY GAME SLIPPING AWAY.
IT'S ALWAYS A SCARY THING.
I JUST PRAY THAT I CAN KEEP IT
TOGETHER GOING TOWARD THE END.
â™ª
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE ATTACHED TO
A ROPE.
ON MY GO YOU'LL RACE TO UNSPOOL
THAT ROPE.
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH,
YOU'LL ASSEMBLE A BRIDGE.
YOU'LL THEN USE SANDBAGS TO
KNOCK OVER A SERIES OF BLOCKS.
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 YES.
 YES.
 Jeff: THE WINNER WILL BE
TAKEN BACK TO THE TEMPLES WHERE
YOU STARTED YOUR JOURNEY 33 DAYS
AGO.
YOU'LL BE BLESSED BY THE MONKS.
YOU'LL ENJOY BEAUTIFUL FOOD.
AND THEN YOU WILL SPEND THE
MIGHT SLEEPING IN THE TEMPLES.
 NO WAY.
 WOW.
 Jeff: THIS TRULY IS A
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE TO
DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: WE FIRST RAN THIS
CHALLENGE BACK IN OUR 29th
SEASON.
KEITH WON.
 WHOA, KEITH.
 WOW.
 Jeff: SECOND CHANCE FOR
KEITH TO WIN AGAIN.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST STAGE, UNSPOOL THE ROPE
UNTIL YOU THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH
TO GET YOU THROUGH THIS ENTIRE
COURSE.
VERY TOUGH TUCKING THROUGH THESE
CORNERS, TRYING TO GET SOME
SLACK IN THE ROPE.
THIS ROPE IS GOING TO BE WITH
YOU THE ENTIRE TIME.
NOTHING IS EASY ON "SURVIVOR,"
ESPECIALLY ON DAY 33.
SPENCER TAKES OFF, HOPES HE HAS
ENOUGH.
HERE GOES KEITH.
HE'S HEADING OUT.
AND THAT MAKES TASHA GO AND
JEREMY.
WENTWORTH NOW COMING OUT WITH
HER ROPE.
KIMMI STILL GATHERING.
ABI STILL GATHERING.
NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE
SECOND STAGE.
YOU ARE ASSEMBLING A BRIDGE
STEP-BY-STEP.
IT IS KEITH AND SPENCER SIDE BY
SIDE.
THEN JEREMY, THEN TASHA.
ABI STILL COLLECTING ROPE.
FALLING VERY FAR BEHIND IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
THERE'S ONE BIG LOOMING
QUESTION: DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH
ROPE TO GET THEMSELVES TO THE
END?
NOW JEREMY, KEITH, SPENCER AND
TASHA.
JEREMY AND KEITH SIDE BY SIDE IN
THIS CHALLENGE.
SPENCER TRYING TO STAY IN IT.
KEITH THROUGH.
HE'S GOING TO START TOSSING
SANDBAGS.
JEREMY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
ROPE.
HE'S GOT HIS BRIDGE FINISHED.
BIG FALL.
KEITH WITH A NICE TOSS.
GOT TO KNOCK 'EM COMPLETELY OFF
THAT TABLE.
HERE IS THE TEST: DOES KEITH
HAVE ENOUGH ROPE TO RETRIEVE HIS
SANDBAG?
AND HE DOES.
SPENCER NOW THROUGH.
JEREMY NOW TRYING TO UNTANGLE
THAT ROPE.
ROPE MANAGEMENT COMING INTO PLAY
AS PREDICTED.
AND KEITH WITH ANOTHER HIT.
SPENCER NOW TRYING TO REACH HIS
SANDBAGS.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ROPE.
SPENCER'S GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY
BACK TO GET MORE ROPE.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR KEITH TO
JUST FREELY FIRE SANDBAG AFTER
SANDBAG, CONTINUING TO KNOCK OFF
BLOCKS.
TASHA IS NOW THROUGH HER BRIDGE.
SHE CAN START TOSSING SANDBAGS.
IT IS KEITH AND TASHA.
SPENCER IS NOW BACK TRYING TO
GET MORE ROPE.
TASHA GOING TO HAVE TO COLLECT
SAND BAGS AND SHE'S NOWHERE
CLOSE.
JEREMY NOW BACK.
HE'S TOSSING.
CAN HE CATCH UP?
HE KNOCKS TWO DOWN.
KEITH WITH ANOTHER NICE TOSS.
AND ANOTHER ONE.
KEITH DOWN TO TWO BLOCKS LEFT.
JEREMY STILL FIRING.
HE'S OUT OF BAGS.
DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH ROPE TO GET
TO THEM?
NO!
HE DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROPE.
KEITH COULD WIN IT FOR THE
SECOND TIME AND HE DOES.
KEITH REPEATS, WINS INDIVIDUAL
REWARD AND IS HEADED BACK TO THE
TEMPLE.
 GAD JOB, KEITH.
 Jeff: KEITH, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, KEITH.
 Jeff: BIG WIN.
ONLY PERSON TO HAVE EVER WON
THIS CHALLENGE.
YOU'VE WON IT TWICE.
 I KIND OF LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, I KIND OF LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: YOU'LL LEAVE TODAY,
RETURN TO THE BEAUTIFUL TEMPLES.
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU.
HERE'S WHERE THE GAME ONCE AGAIN
GETS REALLY INTERESTING.
 OH, MY GOD.
 KELLEY HELPED ME, I'M GOING
TO HELP KELLEY.
SHE BROUGHT ME MY WIFE.
 Jeff: KEITH, YOU CAN BRING
ONE MORE PERSON.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING.
 SPENCER, COME ON.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: WHY SPENCER?
 NO REAL LOGIC.
I'M STILL FLASHING BACK TO WHEN
WE GOT TO GO, AND AS I LOOK AT
JEREMY, HE'S MARRIED 12, 15
YEARS, HIM AND VAL SOLID.
I CAN'T THINK OF HER NAME,
TASHA, TASHA'S LITTLE COUSIN,
BUT SPENCER'S NEW LITTLE GIRL
COME ALL THE WAY, DIDN'T GET TO
SEE HER BUT FIVE MINUTES.
IF THAT SOUNDS LOGICAL, HOORAY
FOR ME, IF NOT, THROW IT OUT THE
HAT.
JUST RATTLING ON AT THE MOUTH.
 Jeff: TASHA, YOU LOOK A
LITTLE FRUSTRATED.
 OH, NEW YORK WHETHER I'M ON
REWARD OR BACK AT CAMP, I TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY,
AND SOMETIMES BEING BACK AT CAMP
IS JUST AS ADVANTAGEOUS AS GOING
ON REWARD.
SO IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.
I UNDERSTAND KEITH WAS
EXHAUSTED, BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN
REMEMBER MY NAME LET ALONE TRY
TO EXPLAIN HIS RATIONALE.
I'M LIKE, IS KEITH REALLY
PLAYING UP HIS SOUTHERN I'LL
JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE ROLE, OR
IS HE REALLY THAT SLOW?
 Jeff: KEITH, WENTWORTH,
SPENCER, SHOULD BE AN AMAZING
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.
KIMMI, JEREMY, TASHA, ABI, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
YOU GUYS, ENJOY YOUR REWARD.
 KEITH, SPENCER AND I GET TO
GO ON THIS AMAZING AWARD.
I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TWO
PEOPLE I'M IN ON REWARD.
I HAVEN'T HAD A STRONG ALLIANCE
THIS ENTIRE GAME.
PART OF THIS GAME, YOU WANT TO
HAVE ABALLIANCE TO SOME DEGREE
OR AT LEAST TRUST IN SOME PEOPLE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO.
 THAT WAS A GAD CHALLENGE.
 IT WAS.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
REWARD.
 YEAH.
 KEITH HAS BEEN VERY
IMPRESSIVE IN CHALLENGES.
 KEITH IS STRONG.
 YEAH, HE IS.
 HE'S VERY UNDERESTIMATED.
 HE'S THE NEW GOLDEN BOY.
 WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?
 YOU ALL THINK KEITH SHOULD BE
NEXT TO GO?
 YES, BECAUSE IF HE KEEPS
WINNING CHALLENGES, THAT'S A
PROBLEM.
 TODAY'S 33 AND I HAVE TO GET
TO DAY 39.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK I'M A
GOALT TO TAKE TO THE END, THAT'S
WHY I BELIEVE PEOPLE MAY BE
WILLING TO GET TO THE END.
IT'S ALL ABOUT USING PEOPLE IN
THIS GAME, AND I LOVE WATCHING
THEM STRUGGLE AND SCRAMBLE AND
GO CRAZY.
WHY NOT?
I'M A VILLAIN.
VILLAINS HAVE MORE FUN.
 WHAT'S YOUR RESERVATION WITH
KEITH?
 I DON'T HAVE A RESERVATION.
 I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PROBLEM
IS?
 THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK
YOU TRUST WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO
THE ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.
THAT'S IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
 THE GIRLS ARE ALL SAYING,
LET'S GET OUT KEITH, LET'S GET
OUT KEITH, THAT'S AN OPTION.
BUT I HAVE BUYERS REMORSE RIGHT
NOW BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT
JOE AND GOT RID OF ABI.
I MIGHT BE MAD ABOUT GOING ON
THAT REWARD TODAY, LIKE, LISTEN,
I'M GOING TO EAT ON DAY 39.
GIVE ME THAT BREAKFAST AND LIKE
LET ME TELL EVERYBODY ON THE
JURY WHY I DESERVE THAT $1
MILLION.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.
 KEITH NEEDS TO GO.
LISTEN, IT'S THE GAME WE HAVE
THE PLAY.
IT'S ONLY A COUPLE DAYS.
 EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING TO BE
IN YOUR CONTROL.
 I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO GET
TO THE FINAL, BUT THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THERE IS WITH PEOPLE YOU
TRUST.
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
AT THIS POINT I THINK JEREMY
NEEDS TO LET GO, LET ME MAKE A
MOVE, AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO,
THEN I WILL FIND SOMEONE ELSE.
PEOPLE BETTER GET ON BOARD OR
THEY'RE ABOUT TO MISS THIS SHIP
BECAUSE IT'S SAILING.
 LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, WE
LOOKED A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 NOW WE'RE AS DISINTEGRATED AS
IT IS.
 I KNOW.
 I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER
REWARD.
CAMBODIAN TEMPLES, IT'S AMAZING
TO THE POINT THAT I'M SLAPPING
MYSELF EVERY TWO MINUTES THAT
I'M HERE, THAT I'M SEEING WHAT
I'M SEEING.
 THAT LOOKS LIKE RAIDERS OF
THE LOST ARC OR SOMETHING.
 IT DOES.
 INDIANA JONES HAS PROBABLY
BEEN HERE.
33 DAYS AGO I WALKED RIGHT HERE
WITH THIS INCREDIBLE JOURNEY
AHEAD OF ME, AND NOW TO COME
BACK HERE AND SEE THESE TEMPLES
DOING WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN MY
SECOND CHANCE, WHICH IS SHOW
THROUGH THIS GAME HOW I'VE
CHANGED AND USE THAT CHANGE TO
WIN, IT'S MORE THAN THE
REJUVENATION I NEED TO GO THESE
LAST SIX DAYS.
[PRAYING]
 IF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ASKED
ME, YOU KNOW, WHERE HAS KEITH
BEEN FOR THE LAST 30 DAYS?
IS HE SITTING IN A TEMPLE IN
CAMBODIAN, OR HAS HE JUST GOT
BACK OFF THE SHUT FEDERAL MARS?
THEY'D SAY HE'S DAMN SURE IN
MARS BECAUSE HE'S NOT IN
CAMBODIA
THAT'S HOW AMAZING IT WAS.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
YOU JUST DON'T RUN ACROSS STUFF
LIKE THAT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN TRUMP
THIS, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
 WE GOT THIS REALLY CULTURAL
EXPERIENCE.
I'LL NEVER DO THAT IN MY LIFE.
SO OF ALL THE REWARD, THIS WAS
SUCH A GREAT ONE TO WIN.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
OH, MY GOSH.
I HAVEN'T HAD THE EASIEST GO IN
THIS GAME, LIKE I'VE BEEN ON THE
BOTTOM A LOT, SO COMING OUT HERE
FOR A SECOND CHANCE, I JUST WANT
THE PROVE THAT I CAN DO IT.
AND SO CLOSE TO THE END OF THE
GAME, IT'S JUST LIKE, WOW, LIKE
I'M ALMOST THERE.
 TO CAMBODIA, TO BEING
SURROUNDED BY THINGS WE WOULD
NEVER SEE IN OUR LIFE.
 WHAT WAS THAT CALLED JUST
THEN?
DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR THIS
DANCE IN
 NO.
 OH, MY GOSH.
THAT LOOKS SO GOOD.
 WE'VE MADE IT.
 IS THAT WINE AND SPAGHETTI?
 KEITH NAIL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
 OH, MY GOD, GUYS, SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON AT
CAMP?
TRYING TO REIN IN ABI?
 SHE'S NOT PISSED, IS SHE?
 PROBABLY AFTER TODAY SHE IS.
 I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY WITH
ABI.
BEING ON REWARD WITH SPENCER AND
STEVE, IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE AT.
I JUST WANT TO GET TO FINAL
THREE.
THAT'S THE GOAL IN THIS GAME.
 IF YOU TOLD ME LIKE FINAL
THREE, I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY
WITH THIS.
 I WOULD, TOO.
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.
 WE JUST GOT TO MAKE THAT
HAPPEN.
 WE CAN.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO CLOSE.
WE'RE A COUPLE DAYS AWAY.
 EXACTLY.
 ANY TIME YOU'RE AT A REWARD
WITH THIS FEW PEOPLE LEFT IN THE
GAME, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
MAKE A FINAL THREE DEAL.
WENTWORTH AND KEITH AND I MADE A
PACT TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE,
BUT IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ME THE
SAY THAT THERE'S ANY FINAL THREE
THAT I'M LOCKED INTO.
IF I COULD CHOOSE ANY FINAL
THREE, I WOULD LOVE TO BE
SITTING THERE WITH ABI AND WITH
KEITH.
IT'S A QUESTION OF MAKING IT
HAPPEN NOW.
 WHO DO YOU THINK?
 JEREMY.
 MAYBE JEREMY WOULD BE A GREAT
PERSON TO DO SECOND BECAUSE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTING
IT.
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO DO
TASHA AND THEN JEREMY.
 UH-HUH.
 WE COULD USE ABI FOR A NUMBER
RIGHT NOW.
TAKE OUR FOUR, AND GO AFTER
TASHA.
 I WANT TASHA GONE.
 WE'RE NOW VERY SOLID.
SO ALL IS WELL AND GOOD AS LONG
AS THAT FOURTH PERSON IS FEELING
GOOD, AS LONG AS THAT FOURTH
PERSON IS A SOUND, RATIONAL
PLAYER WHO WILL MAKE THE GOOD
DECISION FOR OUR GROUP.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT FOURTH
PERSON IS ABI, WHO IS NONE OF
THOSE THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO WAKE UP ON DAY
38, US AND ABI.
 WOULD YOU FEEL SOME TYPE OF
WAY IF I SALT DOWN WITH JEREMY
AND TALKED.
 CAN I PUT THAT RICE OVER
THERE?
 YEAH.
 YOU GUYS TALK IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE FEELING
UNCOMFORTABLE.
 IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IF YOU WANT THE INCLUDE ME, IT
WOULD BE BETTER, BUT IF YOU
DON'T...
 WE CAN DO BOTH.
 TASHA DID ASK IF IT WAS OKAY
FOR HER AND JEREMY TO TALK, BUT
YOU NEED FOUR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW
IN ORDER TO SWITCH THE GAME, AND
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LOT MORE IN
MY POCKET THAN JEREMY DOES.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
YOU GUYS GO TALK.
 IS ABI A SCORPIO?
I GOT TWO OF THEM IN MY HOUSE.
THAT'S WHY I DRINK.
 WHAT DID I MISS?
 HOW YOU DOING?
 THIS CHICK, I CAN'T IMAGINE
DATING HER.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
 IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU SAY
WITH ABI, AND I'VE COME TOO FAR
TO LET ABI-MARIE GOMEZ RUIN MY
GAME.
OKAY.
I DON'T THINK WE TAKE OUT KEITH
FIRST.
WHAT IF WE MAKE IT ABI?
 WHAT ABOUT KEITH BEING A
THREAT?
 YOU ALL JUST GOT TO KILL THE
FREAKIN' CHALLENGE.
BUT I THINK ABI IS... WE CAN'T
HAVE ANY MESSINESS COMING DOWN
TO THE FINALS.
 KEITH IS A CREDIBLE THREAT,
BUT ABI IS VERY VOLATILE.
IF I SAY THE WRONG THING OR MAKE
THE WRONG JOKE, SHE COULD
TOTALLY SCREW UP MY GAME.
SHE'LL FLIP IN A HEARTBEAT.
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TRYING TO
GET TO THE END IF YOU DON'T EVEN
TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT CAN TAKE
YOU THERE.
THIS IS LIKE THE FINAL BIG MOVE
THAT WE CAN MAKE.
IF WE SCREW THIS ONE VOTE UP,
WE'RE DONE.
 TASHA SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT IF WE VOTE ABI OUT.
IT DOES GIVE ME ONE LESS THING I
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT, SO I
LIKE THAT IDEA.
 YOU THINK FOR SURE...
 I THINK WE'RE LOCKED IN.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT SPENCE SAYS.
TASHA IS IFFY ON SPENCER.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S 100%.
IT'S A POSSIBILITY HE COULD JUMP
SHIP, RUN AND TELL KELLEY AND
KEITH THE WHOLE PLAN AND IT WILL
BLOW UP IN OUR FACE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK BOTH
NECKLACES.
 ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
 Jeff: THANK YOU, KEITH.
ONLY NEED ONE TODAY.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY BACK UP FOR
GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE OUT INTO THE
WATER AND ACROSS A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES.
WHEN YOU REACH THE END, YOU'LL
RETRIEVE A KEY AND RACE BACK.
YOU'LL THEN USE THAT KEY TO OPEN
A CHEST, REMOVE THE PUZZLE
PIECES AND SOLVE A FIVE-PIECE
PUZZLE.
FIRST TO WYNANTSKILLS IMMUNITY
AND GARN TEENED A ONE IN SIX
SHOT OF WINNING THIS GAME.
SECOND CHANCE STORY TODAY IS A
PUZZLE.
IN OUR FIRST CHALLENGE OF OUR
30th SEASON, THIS WAS ONE OF
THREE PUZZLE CHOICES.
NOBODY CHOSE IT.
SO THE SECOND CHANCE STORY IS
THE PUZZLE.
FINALLY GETTING CHANCE TO BE
RUN.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND A GUARANTEED
ONE IN SIX SHOT, SURVIVORS
READY?
GO!
ANYWAY YOU CAN GET THROUGH THESE
OBSTACLES.
ATTACK IT.
EVERYBODY IS IN THIS.
JEREMY AND SPENCER OUT TO THE
EARLY LEAD.
YOU FALL OFF, YOU GOT TO GO BACK
TO THE LAST OBSTACLE.
JEREMY AND SPENCER SIDE BY SIDE.
HERE COMES KEITH AND WENTWORTH.
GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
THIS CHALLENGE WILL KICK YOUR
BUTT.
AND... WHOA, SPENCER FELL OFF.
GOT TO COME BACK.
GOING TO BE JEREMY FIRST IN THE
WATER.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS WAY BEHIND.
KIMMI, ABI IN LAST.
HERE WE GO.
SPENCER NOW BACK.
OH, BIG FALL BY KEITH.
JEREMY TO THE BUOY TRYING TO GET
THAT KEY.
KIMMI TAKES A BIG FALL.
KEITH IN THE WATER.
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR KEY, HEAD
BACK.
TASHA STRUGGLING TO STAY IN
THIS.
IT IS JEREMY AND SPENCER IN THE
LEAD.
KEITH AND WENTWORTH RIGHT
BEHIND.
SPENCER MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH
THE WATER.
JEREMY AND SPENCER BACK AT THE
SAME TIME.
SPENCER MADE UP A LOT OF TIME IN
THE WATER.
SPENCER NOW IN THE LEAD.
35 DAYS.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW GETS
YOU TO DAY 36.
THIS IS IT.
KIMMI AND ABI COMING BACK.
TASHA STILL IN HER BUOY.
SPENCER DIGGING DEEP.
JEREMY ON HIS SAIL.
HERE COMES KEITH.
WHOA, BIG HIT BY SPENCER.
YOU OKAY?
SPENCER'S GOT TO GO BACK.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR JEREMY
NOW.
SPENCER TOOK IT RIGHT ON THE
CHIN.
SPENCER'S ACROSS.
LET'S GO, KEITH.
THAT PUZZLE IS ONLY FIVE PIECES.
YOU CAN SOLVE IT IN A MOMENT.
GETTING BACK FIRST COULD BE THE
DIFFERENCE.
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE OUT HERE, TO
SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.
TASHA STILL STRUGGLING.
IT IS JEREMY, SPENCER AND KEITH.
HERE COMES WENTWORTH, ABI AND
KIMMI.
TASHA STILL IN THE WATER
STRUGGLING.
ONLY FIVE PIECES IN THIS PUZZLE.
WHEN YOU GET IT, IT WILL BE
INSTANTLY, AND IT WILL BE OVER
LIKE THAT.
YOU ARE NOT OUT OF THIS
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE IS NO
WORKING CLOSER AND CLOSER.
THIS IS THE KIND OF PUZZLE YOU
SOLVE IN AN INSTANT AND SPENCER
JUST DID.
SPENCER WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
SOLVING THE PUZZLE IN LESS THAN
15 SECONDS.
UNBELIEVABLE.
ONE IN SIX SHOT GUARANTEED FOR
SPENCER.
SAFETY!
SAFETY!
GET TASHA.
 HELP.
 Jeff: MEDICAL, LET'S GO.
 TAKE IT EASY FOR A MOMENT,
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU GOT ANY PAIN ANYWHERE?
 JUST RELAX.
OKAY.
 I JUST DIDN'T HAVE ANY
ENERGY.
AN I WAS STRUGGLING.
I JUST KEPT TAKING ON WATER.
 OKAY.
 THOSE MEDICAL GUYS WILL TAKE
CARE OF HER.
DON'T WORRY.
IT WILL BE OKAY.
 Jeff: TASHA, IT'S JEFF.
WHAT HAPPENED?
 I THINK TASHA WAS IN THE
WATER AND BASICALLY SHEER
EXHAUSTION MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR
HER TO KEEP UP.
ONCE YOU START TAKING ON WATER,
IT GETS A BIT SCARY.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
TASHA?
 UH-HUH.
 I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN ANY
DANGER OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH HER
LUNGS AT ALL.
BUT I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE
FINE.
 Jeff: WHEN YOU'RE READY
WE'LL TAKE YOU IN.
ALL RIGHT?
 I'M READY.
 Jeff: YOU READY?
YOU SURE?
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
 I THINK WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED,
35 DAYS.
 IT'S SCARY.
IT'S JUST SCARY.
 IT CATCHES UP TO YOU.
 Jeff: SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
NOW WHEN YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW
YOU'RE SAFE BUT YOU'RE STILL
SORT OF COMING DOWN FROM THE
PANIC?
 IT'S FRUSTRATING AND I THINK
WE ALL GIVE EVERYTHING WE HAVE,
AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
LEFT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE FINISH THE OTHER PART
OF THIS STORY, WHICH IS MASSIVE
WIN BY SPENCER.
 AWESOME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY SEATED, ALL
RIGHT?
 YES, YES.
 Jeff: OKAY.
SPENCER, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
I GOT THE TELL YOU, WE HAVE
TESTED THAT PUZZLE A LOT.
NOBODY EVER HAS DONE IT THAT
FAST, EVER.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
YOU ARE GUARANTEED A ONE IN SIX
SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
TASHA, YOU SITTING DOWN
SURROUNDED BY A FIREFIGHTER
T-SHIRT AND TWO FIREFIGHTERS
HOLDING IT SPEAKS TO THE
CAMARADERIE THIS GROUP HAS, AND
YET TONIGHT IN A FEW HOURS
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.
THE GAME NEVER STOPS.
THE ONLY CERTAIN THING TONIGHT,
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 TASH ALMOST DROWN.
SHE SWALLOWED A . OF SALT WATER.
THAT'S HOW QUICK SOMETHING LIKE
THAT CAN HAPPEN.
BUT KELLEY, WE TALKED ABOUT IT
ON THE
IN.
HERE WE ARE SITTING AT FOUR.
EASY.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCER.
 ARE YOU FEELING GOOD?
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?
 OKAY.
YOU ALL GOT TO TELL ME ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE.
I MISSED IT.
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, MY
MIND WAS SAYING, SWIM, LIVE, AND
I FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING, JUST
TAKING IN WATER.
IT'S VERY SCARY FOR ME.
 DID YOU GO UNDER?
 SEVERAL TIMES.
LIKE MY LEGS DID NOT MOVE.
I'M ALREADY NOT LIKE THE
GREATEST SWIMMER.
I'M FROM THE MIDWEST.
I'M COMFORTABLE IN A SWIMMING
POOL, BUT THE OCEAN IS JUST A
DIFFERENT ANIMAL, AND I LOST IT.
 YOU HAVE TO WALK IT OFF AND
THINK ABOUT IT.
 IT'S A SCARY THING.
 AT THIS POINT I'M SO NERVOUS
ABOUT TONIGHT BECAUSE I SUSPECT
THAT MAYBE WENTWORTH, KEITH AND
SPENCER BONDED ON THE REWARD, SO
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SPENCER
IS STILL WITH JEREMY, KIMMI AND
MYSELF, BECAUSE ABI MUST GO.
 WE'RE STILL THINKING THE
SAME, TASHA.
 YEAH.
 WELL, I KNOW YOU ALL GOT KIND
OF A TOGETHERNESS.
WE CAN COUNT ON...
 ALL FOUR OF US TOGETHER.
 WE'RE ALL GOOD.
 IF WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE,
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
AS LONG AS WE'RE CLOSE.
 YOU FEEL OKAY, RIGHT?
 I'M GOOD.
AS LONG AS IT'S NONE OF US.
 AS LONG AS I'M STILL HERE,
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS AT THE END
OF THE DAY.
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT WHO TO
BRING TO THE END WITH ME AT THIS
POINT.
 FOUR IS ALL WE NEED.
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO
CHICAGO AND HUNT YOU DOWN AND
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO
BRAZIL, AM I?
 YOU'LL NEVER FIND ME IN
BRAZIL.
I JUST NEED TO GET TO THE END.
MY RESUME HAS GONE UP A LITTLE
BIT, TOO, YOU KNOW?
 OKAY.
HERE'S THE PLAN, WE CANNOT LET
WENTWORTH, ABI AND KEITH MAKE IT
TO THE END.
THAT WOULD BE AN ABOMINATION.
 IN THIS SEASON.
 LIKE MAYBE ANOTHER SEASON
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HER, LIKE
THIS SEASON IT WOULD BE A
DISSERVICE.
 RIGHT.
 TO THE FANS WHO VOTED US ON,
TO ALL OF THE... THE BLIND
SIDES, WHY...
 IF THAT'S THE FINAL THREE.
 REALLY.
OKAY.
HERE'S THE PLAN.
ABI.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
 I MEAN, I WANT TO DO WHAT I
SAID I WANTED TO DO BEFORE.
WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME.
DID YOU GATE CHANCE TO TALK TO
KIMMI.
 OH, YEAH.
 DAY 39, GUYS.
DO IT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I'VE HAD CONTROL OF MY FATE
FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS GAME,
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP,
SO TONIGHT GOING INTO TRIBAL, MY
TWO OPTIONS ARE GO WITH KIMMI,
JEREMY, TASHA AND TARGET THE
WEAK PLAYERS WHO EVERYONE WANTS
TO DRAG TO THE END, LIKE ABI.
 IT BETTER BE THE FOUR OF US
TONIGHT.
IT BETTER BE FOR ABI TONIGHT.
 MY OTHER OPTION IS TO GO WITH
WENTWORTH, ABI AND KEITH AND
TAKE OUT THE BIG GUNS AND PRAY I
GET TO THE END WITH THESE GUYS.
IT'S A BREAKING POINT NOW.
IT'S THE FINAL SEVEN.
IT'S A POINT OF NO RETURN.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH,
CIERA, FISHBACH AND JOE VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO LET'S START WITH THE REWARD.
KEITH, YOU WIN YOUR SECOND
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE IN A ROW.
BIG REWARD TO GO BACK WHERE THIS
ALL BEGAN, BACK TO THE TEMPLES.
 THAT'S RIGHT, BACK TO WHERE
WE STARTED.
WE GOT TO EAT INSIDE A
1,000-YEAR-OLD TEMPLE.
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHAT IS THAT
LIKE?
IT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE?
 OH, YEAH, IT'S THE KIND OF
REWARD THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
CONNECTED TO THE COUNTRY YOU'RE
PLAYING "SURVIVOR" IN.
 Jeff: SO THE FLIP SIDE IS
YOU PICK KEITH AND WENTWORTH.
YOU HAVE A NICE GROUP OF THREE
WITH THIS REWARD.
NOW FOUR PEOPLE ARE LEFT BACK AT
CAMP.
 YEAH, GREAT EXPERIENCE, BUT I
DEFINITELY THOUGHT, WHAT AM I
MISSING?
IT'S A LONG TIME TO BE AWAY.
 Jeff: TASHA, THE OTHER BIG
EVENT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT,
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
YOU GOT A LITTLE OVERWHELMED IN
THE WATER AND HAD TO BE RESCUED.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW?
 IT'S BEEN ROUGH ALL DAY.
 Jeff: I GOT TO BELIEVE THAT
MUCH JUST ADRENALINE AND ENERGY
COURSING THROUGH YOUR BODY, THAT
WHEN YOU FINALLY GET BACK THE
CAMP YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.
 EXHAUSTED MENTALLY,
PHYSICALLY, AND I TRIED EO ACT
LIKE I WASN'T.
I THOUGHT I WAS DROWNING.
 THAT'S SCARY.
 Jeff: SPENCER, HOW DOES AN
EVENT LIKE THAT IMPACT THE GAME?
 ANY EVENT IN "SURVIVOR" IS
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE, GOOD
OR BAD.
 Jeff: KIMMI, HAS THERE BEEN
ANY TALK ABOUT IDOLS.
 IDOL TALK ALWAYS COMES INTO
PLAY.
IT'S LIKE, OH, IT COULD BE HERE.
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS TO
VOTE ONE WAY AND HAVE A BACK-UP
PLAN IN CASE AN IDOL IS PLAYED.
 Jeff: KEITH, KIMMI JUST
SAID SOMETHING I HAVE RARELY
HEARD AT TRIBAL, "DO WE HAVE
ENOUGH NUMBERS."
THAT WOULD APPLY A GROUP.
 I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
SEE ON THE BOAT WILL GET US BACK
TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, "WE," WHERE
WE NEED TO BE.
 I AM OFFICIALLY IN CLUB WEE.
 Jeff: SO JEREMY, KIMMI SAYS
WE, AND SPENCER SAYS, I'M A
"WE," TOO.
 I WAS SITTING AT CAMP AND
THERE'S FIVE VOTING BLOCS.
EVERYBODY IS PART OF A WE.
 Jeff: TASHA, WOULD YOU
AGREE THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE
GROUPS OF WE?
 I THINK PEOPLE ARE KEEPING
THEIR OPTIONS OPEN, BUT WHILE
PEEP ARE FOCUSING ON THESE
OPTION, THEY MAY BE MISSING OUT
ON A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO
REALLY LOCK IN BECAUSE IF YOU
CAN GET A WE THAT WILL LOCK IN,
THE OUTCOME WOULD BE MORE
FAVORABLE FOR ALL OF THE WEES.
 Jeff: IS THERE ANYBODY HERE
THAT FEELS REALLY CONFIDENT THAT
MY WE IS GOING TO REIGN SUPREME?
 I TELL YOU WHAT, I FEEL
PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT MY WEES
WILL REIGN SUPREME.
 Jeff: I LOVE THE HONESTY.
 LET'S DO IT.
TIME TO VOTE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHY DID YOU
SHAKE YOUR HEAD AT THAT.
 I ADMIRE HIS CONFIDENCE
BECAUSE I'M STILL VERY NERVOUS.
THIS IS A GREAT FOR TONIGHT, BUT
IF IT DOESN'T GO MY WE'S WAY,
IT'S NOT SO GOOD FOR TOMORROW.
 Jeff: JEREMY, HOW CONFIDENT
ARE YOU IN YOUR WE TONIGHT?
 IN WHICH WE?
 Jeff: WOW.
AND ABI, WHEN YOU HEAR THAT,
DOES THAT GET YOU UNNERVED OR
EXCITED?
 IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE IT
MAKES ME WONDER WHICH WE I
SHOULD GO WITH MYSELF.
I'M A RISK TAKER, SO WE'LL SEE.
WE WILL SEE.
 Jeff: I GUESS IT IS TIME TO
FIND OUT WHICH WE WILL REIGN
SUPREME TONIGHT.
TIME TO VOTE.
ABI, YOU'RE UP.
 SORRY, GIRL.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT ANOTHER
DAY.
 LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE ABI.
TASHA.
ABI.
TASHA.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES ABI, TWO
VOTES TASHA.
ABI.
THAT'S THREE VOTES ABI, TWO
VOTES TASHA.
KEITH.
THAT'S THREE VOTES ABI, TWO
VOTES TASHA, ONE VOTE KEITH, ONE
VOTE LEFT.
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
ABI.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: ABI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 WELL PLAYED.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, ANOTHER BLIND SIDE IS THE
PERFECT SETUP FOR WHAT MIGHT BE
ONE OF THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE
FINISHES IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR."
GRAB YOU TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON THE
SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR"...
 YOU'RE NOT GIVING.
 YOU'RE NOT EITHER.
 Jeff: THIS CLOSE TO THE
END, NO ONE IS GIVING UP THEIR
SECOND CHANCE WITHOUT A FIGHT.
GO!
 NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT STAYING
ALIVE.
 WE DID NOT EXPECT THIS.
 COME TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.
BUY A TICKET.
IT MIGHT BE EPIC.
 Jeff: FIRST TIME IN 31
SEASONS.
JOIN US FOR THE FINALE
 I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT
WASN'T MY TURN.
THE ONE TIME I THINK I'M SAFE.
I GOT BLIND SIDED.
I WILL BE AT THE FINAL TRIBAL,
AND I WILL BE DECIDING WHO WINS
$1 MILLION.
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
I THINK THAT I GAINED A LOT OF
PERSONAL GROWTH, AND I'M HAPPY
NOT TO BE WITH THOSE CRAZY
PEOPLE ANYMORE.
