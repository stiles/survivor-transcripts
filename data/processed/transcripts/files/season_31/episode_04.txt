        "survivor," after a surprise
switch, drop your buff,
"survivor" second chance went
from two tribes to three tribes.
The new ta keo tried was
building confidence.
 we have four number-one draft
picks.
 jeff: The new bayon tribe
was building relationships.
 I'm trying something new.
I'm trying to have feelings.
 jeff: While the new andara
tribe had two in the minority.
 when we come back together,
you can join up.
 my old members want to be ta
keo strong.
Tasha is whispering sweet
nothings in my ear.
 jeff: At the immunity idol,
jeremy secretly found an idol.








Ankor went the tribal council.
 I made a deal with you and he
Made a deal with her.
 I'm in the middle of a big
Ole mess.
I shouldn't have done that.
 jeff: Facing tribal
council, the former ta keo
Couldn't get along.
 I know I'm on the bottom with
You guys, so I'm going to vote
with them.
 jeff: So tasha and savage
used it to their advantage.
 you vote tasha and I'll vote
peih-gee.
 we were down.
 jeff: At tribal council,
Woo voted for abi again.
Third person voted out of
"survivor" second chance.
But it was peih-gee who was sent
Home.
 good luck.
 jeff: The tribe has spoken.
17 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight.








Captioning funded by cbs
 and ford.
We go further, so you can.
 I can't believe I'm here.
I dodged a bullet.
I came back from that challenge
thinking I was gone.
But I did not get one single
vote.
 thank you.
I'm grateful.
I just want you guys to know I'm
loyal.
I've always been loyal to abi.
I want you guys to tell me what
I need to do to move myself to
you.
 I am endebted to these people
now, which makes me sick.
I have to kiss their asses, but
this is my second chance.
I'm going to do what I have to
do.
 honestly, peih-gee should not
have gone home.
But the challenge was the worst
thing ever.
He's a sneak.
It should have been him.
 I'm feeling great because I
came in here bottom two.
And I initially thought that it
would be either savage of myself
Going home.
But now we're in control.
 he's the source of all the
contention and all the problems.
 I agree.
 so I'm just saying, you are
Not going anywhere.
You're not.
 tasha, I'm really
uncomfortable with what just
Happened.
 we'll talk about it.
 I don't want to talk about
it.
I have a problem when you take
someone that just voted me aside
And have a conversation.
 abi, I didn't lie to you.
I didn't blind side you.
I had your back.
So what's the beef?
 aligning with abi does make
Me a little nervous because she
has deep-rooted insecurities.
She has some paranoia, which
makes her completely
Unpredictable.
 we've been scheming on
Getting me out a long time ago.
It bothers me to get these votes
At tribal, especially when
you're coming from a tribe like
Ta keo where everyone is
plotting to get you out.
For me it's starting to come off
as personal.
I feel great that I am in the
majority, but I have my ears
Open, and woo has voted for me
twice.
And if the decision was up to
me, he's going to be the next
One going home.
 in the last immunity
challenge, I found the hidden
Immunity I doll.
I got it, and I'm like, I'm so
Happy.
It took two years to get this
Thing, but I finally got my
idol.
It's a thing of beauty.
It's a thing of beauty.
I love it.
I love it.
 any luck with the idol?
 no.
I think about mike last season
in the tree.
I want the climb a tree and
look, you know what I mean?
 I hear you, but how would you
even know what tree top it could
Be in?
 this is my idol.
I'm not telling anybody.
So I told steven that we got to
Really look for this thing
because I don't need him to
Think that I have it.
 what we can do is we can
Start here.
You go that way, I'll go that
Way, and we'll just hit it hard.
We got to find this thing.
It's out here.
It's out here.
I want steven to think that I'm
still looking for it and it's
For us.
I want the keep pulling him
Close.
I know they're going to come
After me at some point, and I
want him to be the one to say,
Listen, they're coming after
you, and I got my get out of
Jail free card.
I would love to be friends with
Steve for life after this.
I'll give him second place, if
You're happy with that.
I'm in the happy with second
Place.
 we survived the night in this
hellhole.
Pretty good, right?
This is a dead cove.
 I know.
This is dead.
 our new camp, no resource, no
shelter, nothing.
 wish me luck.
 I'm gutted.
I started out with the
shangri-la.
I was top dog with an abundance
of seafood.
Now I am in literally a
"survivor" ghetto.
There's nothing here.
 welcome back.
 I wish I had better news.
This is really, really
Difficult.
It's not like we're kicking back
And just having someone feed us
and we're sleeping in hammocks.
I mean, we are in hell right
now.
 you all hungry?
 starving.
Why?
What is it?
 just another day at the
beach.
Getting wet and stomping about.
Who will win is up in the air,
Some will feast and some will
pout.
 feast.
 a rechallenge, which is
Great, because I'm starting to
feel like I'm kind of withering
Away.
So I'm really excited, but I
Just don't know how much we have
in our tank to actually pull
This off.
 jeff: Come on in, guys.
Bayon, ta keo getting your first
Look at the new angkor tribe.
Peih-gee voted out the last
Tribal council.
All right.
You guys ready to get to today's
reward challenge?

Race back.
You'll then use a plank to
Launch that bag into your net.

Their bags in the net wins

Just as fun.

Person to run the entire
challenge.
This is a hero challenge.
You're going to put all your
Eggs in one basket.
Angkor, who's it going to be?
Who are you going to put up?
 I'll do it.

You think to run through that

All three guys trying to
conserve some energy.
You're going to need it for that
plank.
 take it easy.
 jeff: Dietz and jeremy back
First.
Here comes savage.
Now you've got to launch it
using your plank.
Get it up in the air and drop it
in that net.
It is adjustable.
This will take some
Experimenting.
Dietz scores his first one.

Savage has his second back.

 jeff: Dietz now with a big
lead for ta keo.

time.
Jeremy now back with his setting

You're in it.
 jeff: Jeremy short.

time, high-stepping it.

 jeff: This would be a very
Different story for angkor to
win here comes dietz now,
Starting to pick up the pace,
gaining on savage.

 jeff: Both guys digging
Deep.
But, no, one time.
It is dietz and savage right now

Looking for second place.
Dietz, jeremy still in it.
Life just changed at angkor.

Thank you so much.
 jeff: For second place and

Shot at it right here.
 you got this, jeremy.
Jeremy way long.
 jeremy, it's okay.
 it's okay.
You got it.
You got it.
 come on, jeremy.
 jeff: Dietz launches and
scores.
Ta keo wins reward.
Nothing for the bayon tribe.
Angkor, how big is this victory?
 we haven't really eaten in
Four days, and andrew did that
just on pure love for this
Tribe.
 jeff: Angkor, nice reward.
Everything you need to have a
great barbecue back at camp,
Grab your stuff, enjoy your
campfire.
 good job, guys.
Good job, andrew.
 jeff: Ta keo, not a full
barbecue set, but it's in the
Bad.
Come grab your reward.
Head back to camp.
Bayon, got nothing for you.
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.
 part of my demons, I've never
stopped thinking, did I carry my
Weight, did I do enough to get
us over the hump.
And today I gave it everything I
had and we won.
So vindication for me?
Absolutely.
 oh, my god, we're going to
eat.
God bless savage.
You're freaking legend.
 thank you, savage.
 you're legend, brother.
 not eating really for four
days, you get at wit's end, so
When jeff said angkor win, I
almost dropped to my knees.
That's one of the best moments
in "survivor" I ever had.
 I can't believe I'm about to
sit down and dine with you guys.
 this is like major motivation
for us.
 they put a million pounds of
faith in me, because this is
Everything when you're starving,
and I was able to deliver.
 I have grease running down my
fingers.
 we're so winning immunity.
 this little tribe, now they
Know we can compete against all
those big horses on the other
Tribes, and that's huge.
That's a game changer, because
Now I think we can fire on all
cylinders and just not go to
Tribal.
Angkor!
 I think if you lost
"survivor" your first time out,
You need to do something
differently.
I made a big mistake last time.
Strategically I think I played a
Great game.
Socially I didn't.
Pretty much everyone thought I
was going to come in here and be
A little turd and cause them
problems, and probably I was at
The top of the list of everyone
to get out, and I really took
That to heart.
So I read the book "how the win
Friends and influence people."
it says act as sincere as you
Can, sympathize with people.
I know this is bizarre for
People to see chaos kass out
here applying self-help methods,
But I knew I needed to look at
my game play and what I needed
To do.
 wake up.
I see kass over by the tree, and
she's using the machete to cut
Things.
I'm like, what is this woman
Doing.
I don't trust her.
She nicknamed chaos kass.
Hello.
That's her whole thing to, do
something sneaky, making a fake
Immunity idol.
Then I see her out on the beach.
She's like, get away, get away.
So I know she has stuff up her
Sleeve.
She's chaos kass.
Come on.
 happy belated birthday.
A little piece of bayon.
A little good luck charm.
 thank you.
 cute.
 I thought you were making
fake idols.
 I thawing everybody would
think that, I was going to trump
Them all.
It's a birthday present good
Luck charm for today.
 thank you, kass.
Very cute.
Thank you.
 I think the winner of "second
chance" will be someone who
Truly embraces evolution and
change, and for me that's being
This more open person.
 oh ye of little faith, as if
I have the skills to make an
idol.
 so what's the deal, spencer,
with you?
 like strategically you mean?
 she voted against me.
 yeah?
 you were next to go?
 I was next to go.
The facts are four bayon and two
Former ta keo, so I know
immediately that wiglesworth and
I are in some degree of trouble,
which puts me in a position of
Having to throw wiglesworth
under the bus.
 would you get rid of kelly?
 yeah.
There are people over there who
own her vote?
 terry, woo, varner.
I need to make it clear to my
Tribe that there are people
wiglesworth will run back to in
The future.
Wiglesworth does have a tight
Bond with like terry and woo.
 yes, she has terry, woo.
 even wentworth, right, is
good with...
 she's good with all of them.
 spencer says that kelly
Wiglesworth has a ton of people
that are in her alliance, but I
Don't think he's being
completely truthful.
 I don't know if she is, if
she is genuine...
 he's a little bit sneaky, so
my first gut reaction was, as
Women, we should be strong, we
should stick together, not only
To keep the girl count up in the
hopes of maybe doing a girls
Alliance, but also to keep the
boys count down.
 she's someone I will always
have trouble trusting.
 this is all stuff we've been
thinking about.
So once a challenge is lost,
spencer needs to go first.
 I'm 100% with it.
 me too.
I love it.
 boom.
 jeff: Come on in, guys.
All right.
You guys ready to get to today's
immunity challenge?
 yes.
 jeff: First things first, I
Will take back the idols.
Kass.
Kimmi.
Once again immunity is back up
For grabs.
For today's challenge, one tribe
Member will be your caller.
The rest of the tribe will be
Blindfolded.
Using only verbal commands, the
Caller will direct the
blindfolded tribe members to
Collect a series of very large
and very heavy puzzle pieces.
Once you have all the puzzle
pieces, take off your blind
Folds and work together to solve
the puzzle.
First two tribes to finish win
immunity.
Safe from the vote.
Losers, tribal council where
Somebody will be the fourth
person voted out of second
Chance.
Bayon, you have one extra
Member.
Sitting someone out.
Who is it going to be?
Monica going to sit out.
Ta keo one extra member.
Who is it going to be?
 ciera.
 jeff: Everybody else take a
Minute to strategize and we'll
get started.
All right.
We have our caller.
It is jeff for angkor, kimmi for
bayon, kass for ta keo.
Here we go.
For immunity, survivors ready?
 you're going to the rim.
 jeff: It's all about
Communication.
 turn around.
 louder, kimmi, I can't hear
you.
 jeff: The tribe who
communicates together the best
Will succeed.
 turn, terry, turn to your
Right.
No, not that one.
 to the left.
Behind you, andrew, behind you.
There you go.
 jeff: There are 16 puzzle
Pieces out here.
That is a lot.
They are all heavy and
unwielded.
Very hard for one person to
carry one alone.
 to your right.
To your right.
 jeff: Bayon back with their
first piece.
Angkor back with their first
piece.
 drop it joe and kelley.
 jeff: We are tied one
Across the board.
 right there.
Drop it.
 jeff: Angkor with their
Second piece.
Bayon with their second piece.
Here comes ta keo with their
second and third.

Keith, drop it.
 jeff: It's hard to hear
when everybody is yelling.
 I can't hear.
 drop it.
 jeff: There it is.
Angkor with their therd piece.
 abi, right here.
 jeff: Bayon with their
Third piece.
 kass, give me something.
 joe!
 jeff: Dietz continues to
Wait for help, like waiting to
get called on in class.
Teacher doesn't see him.
 straight, straight, straight.
 drop it, drop it, drop it.
 jeff: Angkor in the lead
With four petes.
Bayon and ta keo each with
Three.
 turn around, terry.
 kass, we need help.
 I'm yelling at someone else.
 I can't hear.
 drop it.
 jeff: Bayon with their
fourth piece.
16 pieces.
There are still a lot of pieces
Left to find.
Angkor in the lead with 11.
They won the last reward
challenge.
Would love to have another
victory.
Ten for bayon.
Ta keo with seven.
Ta keo in dead last right now.
 I can't hear.
 jeff: Dietz like the guy at
the party that no one will talk
To.
Waiting for an invitation to
Dance.
 joe!
 jeff: Joe just picking a
piece up on his own.
These pieces are massive, but
joe is not waiting for anybody
Else.
Joe back with another piece,
Basically did it all on his own.
Ta keo with another piece.
Angkor with 11.
Bayon with 10.
Ta keo with 9.
Ta keo with another piece.
Joe has put ta keo back in this
challenge.
Angkor back with another piece.
Savage exhausted.
This challenge will kick your
butt.
 ouch.
Ow.
 uh.
 ow.
 you okay?
 drop it.
 ouch.
 ow.
 oh.
 jeff: Not an enviable
Position to be the caller in
this challenge.
Joe with a full-on sprint.
Ta keo now in the lead with 15.
Big comeback.
Ta keo came from dead last.
Ta keo with one piece left.
Bayon and angkor with two.
You are not even half-way done.
You still have to solve this
Puzzle.
 drop it.
 jeff: One piece left for
angkor.
That's 15 for bayon.
Everybody on their last piece.
 andrew, roll it to your
right.
 watch out!
 oh.
 straight to me.
Straight to me.
 jeff: Joe and dietz now
paired up together.
Terry was really on his own.
Now he's got a partner.
 let's go.
 jeff: Ta keo with their
16th piece.
Take off your blindfold and
Start working.
Angkor has their 16th piece.
Take off your masks.
 I can see.
 jeff: Huge immunity on the
line.
 it's so bright.
 oh, my god.
 jeff: Bayon has their
16th.
Take off your masks.
Everybody working on the puzzle
Now.
It is a cube.
There is a pattern on each side.
It's the insignia of your
Tribe's flag.
You've been living with it.
You know what it looks like.
The more progress you make, the
Easier it will get.
 joe, I think this goes over
Here.
 get the b for bayon.
 jeff: Dietz is taking over.
One of the biggest difficulties
Of this puzzle is the weight and
sizes of the pieces.
Just moving them takes so much
work.
The sun is beating down hot.
Everyone can feel it.
 varner, back here.
 jeff: Tasha starting to
Call out some orders now.
 ow.
 jeff: Varner drops a piece
on himself.
Angkor spent a lot of time
moving a lot of pieces, but
Right now they don't look like
they've made any progress at
All.
This is a race between ta keo
And bayon.
Bayon is making a lot of
Progress.
If they're right.
Bayon was last to get all their
pieces, but they're making the
Most progress on the puzzle.
 just like that, yeah.
 spencer thinks he's got
something.
 good job, spencer.
 jeff: Bayon getting very
Close.
Bayon for the win.
Bayon wins immunity!
We're looking for second place.
It's now ta keo and angkor
fighting now to make sure it's
Not them that goes to tribal
council.
Ta keo in the lead.
Angkor can get back in this if
They can find the energy.
 come on.
Angkor literally sleeping on the
pieces.
Ta keo getting closer with every
piece.
You can see the exhaustion on
the faces of angkor.
Almost as if they're just
waiting for ta keo to win.
So we can be done.
Ta keo with one piece left.
Ta keo wins immunity sending
angkor back the tribal council
For the second straight time.
Bayon, congratulations.
 good job.
 thank you.
 jeff: Nobody going home
From bayon, and nobody going
home from ta keo.
 good job.
 jeff: Angkor, tribal
Council once again, you have to
ask, savage, did you just give
Out?
 that's all we had.
I've never been in a state.
I played college football.
I was never as close to this and
I gave it everything I've had.
I've never been here.
It's humbling.
It's scary.
I'm ready to fall over.
 jeff: Angkor, I wish I
could tell you something
Positive was waiting for you
back at camp, but I can't.
Bayon, ta keo, grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
In tribal council tonight.
 good job, you guys.
 good job.
 way to hustle.
 jeff: Angkor, the only
thing waiting for you is a date
With me tonight at tribal
council where somebody will be
The fourth person voted out of
"second chance."
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
 good effort, guys.
Varner, good calling.
 hey, we did our best.
 yeah, we did.
 oh, man.
 good feeling from the full
Belly is gone.
 gone, man.
We went into today thinking
we're going to just decimate
Those guys and continue this
high high, and we just got
Thumped by the most physical
challenge I've ever participated
In, so we just hit this rock
bottom low low, got to go to
Tribal and send somebody home.
 varner, you okay?
 it's my pinkie toe.
It's going to hurt like a bitch
For a few days.
I am absolutely no threat to
Anyone.
 for the record, varner is not
A physical threat.
 thanks to abi, savage and I
Have fought our way from the
bottom to what appears to be the
Top, however, abi is
unpredictable.
She'll make a decision, she'll
be solid.
A few minutes later she doesn't
know, and that worries me.
 she's very cunning.
 yes.
 it's me or you?
 yeah.
 I think it's me.
 you think?
 I do.
They're not telling me anything.
They came over and took over.
And now that abi's officially
Flipped, they have the power.
There's nothing we can do.
 right.
 clearly it's either me or woo
Tonight.
Abi is so in their laps right
Now, she's completely turned her
back on both of us.
But the one thing that I have
working for me is I've never
Voted for abi.
I have saved abi twice.
So if abi's the one making all
the calls here, I might just
Squeak by another week.
 when we first got to this
Camp we were up 4-2, now we're
looking at greg rid of all the
Old ta keo tribe.
It kind of worries me, man.
How do you feel?
 it feels good to be wanted.
 yeah, yeah.
 they're making me feel so
Comfortable in such a good spot,
so I'm...
 don't get too comfortable,
abi.
 I know that.
I understand why they're so
Buddy-buddy.
Because they need you.
 all right.
What if we took out varner.
 you have to remember, you
voted for me twice.
And it's not something that I
consider because he says that he
Wants to work with me, but then
he kind of like stabs me behind
My back.
And I'm going with people that
Value my personality and what I
wring to the table.
Just put yourself in my shoes.
 I understand the situation.
 I know you're going with the
numbers.
I get it.
No hard feelings, but how does
That make me feel?
 uh-huh.
 I tried to rekindle our
relationship with abi, but she
Was pretty upset.
I did write her name down twice,
And she does have a grudge, and
if she's looking for some
Retaliation or vengeance upon
me, then I could be facing a lot
Of trouble going into tribal
tonight.
 what do you think in.
 he has voted for me twice.
He's not a loyal guy toward me.
There's something about him that
Wants to get me out of here.
 here's the thing, varner, I
Thought he should have gone last
time, but...
 but he's not proven anything
to me so far.
 abi is totally fixated on I
don't trust woo.
Woo wrote my name down twice.
But the thing is, woo can help
Us win challenges.
But abi just is contrary.
You say it's blue, she'll say
it's yellow.
Who do you think we're going the
lose immunity with, woo, or
Varner?
Who is the biggest liability in.
 yeah, but varner has
protected me many times.
He has proven his loyalty to me.
 I appreciate his loyalty.
 give me the benefit of the
doubt.
 I think if you want to be
loyal to jeff...
 he was loyal to me before.
 if that makes you sleep at
Night...
 it's not about that, tasha.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Woo, woo, woo hasn't been loyal
To me.
 what scares me is varner is
Very manipulative, and at any
moment he could work his magic,
And now I've lost abi.
 I love you.
You know that.
We've worked well together.
I kind of miss you.
Like we don't talk and cut up
Like we did before.
I miss my abi time.
 oh.
 abi's like the pivotal piece
To this puzzle.
And we might have to do whatever
She wants, otherwise abi's going
to be pissed.
 tonight I have a huge
decision.
It all comes down to winning
challenges versus trust and
Loyalty.
And I hate having to be the
Decision maker.
 jeff: So varner, let's talk
about the cane.
Is that directly from today's
challenge?
 yeah, one of those big pieces
slammed right dunne on my foot.
And it's purple.
It's painful.
And today was a nightmare.
I have never felt like this.
I mean, to not be able to put
two socks together, to get up to
Walk to use the bathroom...
 oh, my gosh!
 to deal with moments like
that, it drains you, but I just
Keep thinking of the millions of
people who voted me here, and I
Keep going.
 jeff: So, woo, there had to
Be a part of you going, varner
would seem like an easy volt.
He's injured.
 varner and I, we feel like
We're on the bottom, and it's
tough, but it's all about being
Able to outlast one another.
I'll be able to outlast him for
Sure.
 jeff: Abi, woo says it's
Him or varner, does that sound
right to you.
 yes.
 jeff: Is this an easy vote
Or difficult?
 I don't know.
You know, I have been reflecting
all day, and I haven't made my
Mind up.
I mean, varner has been very
Loyal to me throughout the game,
but we want the win challenges.
 jeff: Savage, you could
argue that varner hasn't been a
Lot of help at any of the
challenges.
 true.
This is "survivor," though, and
You have to look to the future,
so when a merge come, woo's a
Stud.
Do we want to go up against him
One on one in challenges?
It's just something to think
About.
 but the merge is not going to
Happen any time soon.
 we don't know that.
We don't know that.
 I'm going to be an asset for
You guys.
Varner will not.
 woo is going to be your
nemesis and I am not a physical
Threat to anybody.
 jeff: Woo, you're always
Going to be seen as a possible
threat to win if you get to the
Individual portion.
 sure, but I am that pivotal
Player that's going to stay
loyal, that's going to die for
My alliance.
 but you haven't been in this
Alike, you voted against it,
twice.
 twice.
 and I was loyal to these guys
At the last tribal council, and
if I may make a pitch here...
 jeff: Yes.
 tasha, you've been closed off
To me because I think you see me
as this crappy person, but I
Trust you and I am loyal to you.
Savage, absolutely loyal to you.
We're both old school.
And abi, I have been loyal to
You since day one.
Because I adore you.
I will not vote for you.
I have not voted for you.
I am loyal to you until the end
of it.
So I hope you repay that to me.
 jeff: Wow.
Abi, that was a good pitch.
 that was a good pitch, and I
Just really don't know what to
do.
 jeff: Tasha, weigh it out
from your point of view, because
Both of them have made good
arguments.
 all I know is that in order
to win, we need strong people.
So that's woo.
Loyalty, physical ability,
That's what I'm weighing.
 I have both.
I give you the loyalty and
physical threat.
 you're giving it to her.
You haven't given it to me yet.
 you voted against abi twice.
 sure, I voted against abi,
But I'm telling you guys right
now, I'm willing to jump on
Board with you guys.
Varner's got relationships with
Everyone from the old ta keo
tribe.
How can you trust that he won't
just flip on you.
 we have relationships too
with these people.
 you're cutting them now.
 you're playing the game hard
And I respect that, but you can
play the game watching your own
Neck.
I'm looking out for the better
Good of the group.
 in terms of committing to
These guys, one of us has proven
they're there, the other has
Not.
 but I built a relationship
With you guys the past five, six
days.
I'm willing to commit and stick
to it.
I promise.
 jeff: Wow.
 wow.
 wow.
 wow.
 jeff: I love the fight.
There is nobody here that wants
to give up.
 can we vote?
 let's do it.
 jeff: All right.
You guys want to vote?
Let's vote.
Woo, you're up.
 abi, I promise you right here
right now that I will stay
Loyal.
Don't vote me out.
 make sure you don't write
abi.
 I really hope it's not me
tonight.
 you rock.
 jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.
If anybody has the a hidden
immunity idol, now would be the
Time the play it.
Okay, once the votes are read,
The decision is final.
The person voted out will be
Asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote jeff.
Woo.
Jeff.
Two votes jeff.
One vote woo.
Fourth person voted out of
"survivor: Second chance," jeff.
That's three, that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
 jeff: Varner?
 yep.
 jeff: The tribe had spoken.
Time for you to go.
 thank you, jeff.
 jeff: Well, if there is a
Silver lining to tribal council,
it's this.
Sometimes if you make the right
vote, you return to camp
Stronger and more united.
We'll know soon enough if that
Is the case for this tribe.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 jeff: Next time on
"survivor," in a season of
second chances, the most
Unlikely just might be the most
dangerous.

 five could bring you all the
Way to the end.

 she's a snake in the grass.
 there are going to be
casualties.
 I have a passion that's been
cooking for 15 years.
All of sauden this opportunity
pops up.
It came playing the out in all
directions, but in terms of the
Life adventure, in terms of the
charge to move forward with the
Second half of my life, I
absolutely got what I needed.
And I'm very grateful.
