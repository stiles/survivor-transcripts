         Jeff: WELCOME TO THE
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE"
REUNION SHOW LIVE WHERE JEREMY,
IT WAS A CLEAN SWEEP, ALL TEN
VOTES FOR FOR YOU.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT... YOU WERE
VERY CLEAR, THIS WAS FOR THE
FAMILY.
WHAT... WHY DID YOU THINK YOU
COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY THAT YOUR
WIFE VAL WAS PREGNANT?
 MY LAST SEASON, I'M A
FIREFIGHTER WITH TWO KIDS, AND
EVERYBODY WANTS ME OUT BECAUSE
OF THE SYMPATHY VOTE.
NOW YOU TAKE A FIREFIGHTER WITH
TWO KIDS AND HE HAS A BABY ON
THE WAY, EH...








 Jeff: SO WAS IT ALWAYS
LOCKED THAT SHE WOULD BE A LOVED
ONE OR WAS THERE A DEBATE...
 I WANTED HER TO BE THE LOVED
ONE THE WHOLE TIME.
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT FLYING OUT.
I WOULD TELL THEM THAT SHE WAS
BUSY OR SHE HAD BABY IS SITTING
PROBLEMS, BUT I NEEDED TO SEE
HER.
 Jeff: WHAT IF THERE WAS A
COMPLICATION?
DID YOU TALK ABOUT, IF THIS
HAPPENS, YOU CALL ME, I'M COMING
HOME.
 WE TALKED ABOUT, ANYTHING
WITH THE PREGNANCY, ANYTHING
WITH THE KIDS, I'LL COME HOME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M PLAYING FOR, SO
IF SOMETHING'S WRONG AT HOME,
I'M COMING HOME.
 Jeff: I THOUGHT THAT LAST
CHALLENGE WHEN YOU AND KELLEY








HAD THESE OPPOSITE EMOTIONS, FOR
YOU WHAT I SAW WAS 39 DAYS
FINALLY COMING OUT.
HOW MUCH WEAR AND TEAR DID IT
TAKE TO NOT BE ABLE TO SHARE, TO
NOT BE ABLE TO TALK?
 IT WAS INSIDE OF ME, AND IT
WAS BUBBLING UP THE WHOLE
SEASON, AND FINALLY I WIN AND
I'M IN THE FINAL THREE, AND I
WANT THAT JUST EXPLODE, AND I
STILL CAN'T EXPLODE BECAUSE I
WANT TO HOLD ON TO THAT AND TELL
EVERYBODY WHY I'M PLAYING THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: ONE OF THE BIG TWISTS
AND I THINK THE REASON YOU GUYS
PLAYED SO HARD IS YOU FELT THE
PRESSURE TO LIVE UP TO THIS IDEA
OF BEING VOTED IN.
GLENN, GET A BIG SHOT OF
EVERYBODY.
WHO HERE FELT A DIFFERENT KIND
OF PRESSURE THIS SEASON THAN
WHEN YOU PLAYED BEFORE?
IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE.
TASHA, I THINK YOU SAID AT ONE
POINT THAT WHEN YOU WERE ON YOUR
BOTTOM AT ANGOR, IT WAS THE FANS
THAT GOT YOU THROUGH?
 ABSOLUTELY, THAT WAS MY
LOWEST LOW IN THE GAME.
WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS DOWN
4-2, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FANS
AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED
IN ME AND GAVE ME A SECOND
CHANCE, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LET
THEM DOWN.
I WASN'T GOING OUT WITHOUT A
FIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: CIERA, WHAT IS IT...
WHAT IS THE FEELING?
WHY IS IT DIFFERENT WHEN THE
FANS VOTE YOU IN?
 I GUESS FOR ME IT'S LIKE ON A
NORMAL SEASON YOU HAVE THE
PRESSURE OF YOUR FAMILY ONLY,
AND IT'S LIKE THEY'RE WATCHING
FOR ME THERE.
THIS IS WHY I NEED TO WIN, BUT
NOW THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
SAYING, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY DID
WE SEE YOU PLAY ONE TIME, BUT WE
WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN.
 Jeff: SO IT'S NOT JUST A
BUNCH OF GUYS IN THE OFFICE AT
CBS DAIG...
 IT'S NOT JUST A BUNCH OF
PRODUCERS SAYING, THIS GIRL CAN
DO IT.
IT'S FANS SAYING, THIS IS THE
CAST, THIS IS WHO IS GOING THE
PLAY.
IT CREATES THIS PRESSURE TO MAKE
THESE BIG MOVES AND PLAY THE
GAME AND PLAY TO WIN.
 Jeff: SO A LOT OF THAT BIG
MOVE GAME PLAY CAME WITH IDOLS.
WE DID SOMETHING REALLY FUN THIS
SEASON WHERE WE HID THE IDOLS
BASICALLY IN PLAIN SIGHT.
JEREMY AND WHEN WORTH, WHAT'S
THE FEELING WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO
THAT AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD GET
CAUGHT?
 YOU GET AN IDOL, YOU THINK
YOU FIND AND IDOL AND YOU'RE SO
PUMMED UP AND YOU WANT TO
EXPLODE, YOU WANT THAT MOMENT,
AND THEN IT'S A CLUE TO AN IDOL.
THEN YOU GO TO GO IN FRONT OF
EVERYBODY AND NOW I GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT IF THEY'RE IN FRONT OF US,
ARE THEY WATCHING ME?
WHO ELSE HAS AN IDOL?
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS CLUE?
IT'S CRAZINESS.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU HAD
TWO.
YOU HAD ONE IN A CHALLENGE AND
YOU HAD ONE AT CAMP UNDER THE
SHELTER WITH PEOPLE COMING BACK.
 I DID, YES.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAW ON THE
SCREEN.
THAT'S HOW STRESSFUL IT WAS.
 Jeff: WHAT IS THAT?
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S STRESSFUL, IS
IT A FIVE STRESS LEVEL OR IS
THAT TEN?
 NO, THAT'S OUT OF THE
BUILDING.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE IF YOU
GET AN IDOL, IT PUTS A TARGET ON
YOUR BACK, SO YOU'RE LIKE, CRAP,
I REALLY NEED, THIS AND I NEEDED
IT THE MOST BECAUSE I WAS ON THE
BOTTOM PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE
GAME
SO FOR ME IT WAS JUST I NEED
THIS.
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SEE ME.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
MY WHEELS ARE SPINNING.
HOW DO I GET PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.
I NEED THIS.
IT WAS CRAZY.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
SO MUCH STRESS.
I'VE NEVER FELT THAT IN MY LIFE.
 Jeff: THERE WERE SO MANY
BIG PLAYERS THIS WEEKEND, BUT
ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE WAS
KELLEY WENTWORTH.
 HI.
I'M KELLEY WENTWORTH.
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET SECOND
CHANCES, AND I'M NOT GOING TO
WASTE IT.
 WENTWORTH WINS!
 I DIDN'T TAKE AS MANY RISKS
AS I SHOULD HAVE LAST TIME.
HOW LUCKY AM I?
OKAY.
HAVING A SECOND CHANCE, I WANT
TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND BE PLAYER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF...
 OH, MY GOD.
 THAT'S RIGHT URGE BABY.
THIS IS A SECOND CHANCE.
GO BIG OR GO HOME.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: SO I THINK EVERYBODY
SAW KELLEY START TO WITHER AWAY.
KELLEY LOST 31 POUNDS, WHICH IS
23% OF HER BODY WEIGHT.
IT REALLY TOOK A TOLL.
OKAY.
YOUR IDOL, THE IDOL THAT KIND OF
CHANGED THE GAME WAS WHEN YOU
NULLIFIED NINE VOTES AGAINST YOU
AND BLIND SIDED SAVAGE.
 LOVE YOU, SAVAGE.
 BRILLIANT PLAY.
 Jeff: SO WALK ME THROUGH
THAT MOMENT.
WHEN DID YOU MAKE THAT DECISION?
 BACK AT CAMP THERE WAS TALK
IT WOULD BE MYSELF OR CIERA.
I FEEL LIKE I ACTUALLY HAD A
PRETTY DECENT RELATIONSHIP WITH
JOE AND ALSO KEITH, AND THEY
WERE FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE.
SO ON THE VOTE I VOTED WITH THEM
SAYING, I'M GOING TO VOTE WITH
YOU TO PROVE MY LOYALTY WITH
YOU.
SO NEXT TIME WHEN IT CAME UP, MY
NAME ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, THEY
DID TELL ME, HEY, IT COULD BE
YOU.
SO THAT WAS MY SOCIAL GAME, LIKE
COMING OUT AND THEN TELLING ME,
IF I HAD NOT VOTED FOR KASS, I
LOVE YOU, KASS, BUT IF I HAD NOT
VOTED FOR HER, THEY WOULD HAVE
NEVER TOLD ME THAT IT COULD BE
ME, SO THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY THIS.
 Jeff: AND THIS LEADS US TO
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST DECISIONS TO
MAKE IN THIS GAME, TO SPLIT OR
NOT TO SPLIT THE VOTE BECAUSE
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT MOVE.
SAVAGE, YOU GUYS DECIDED IN THIS
CASE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPLIT
THE VOTE.
WHY?
 SO WE THOUGHT WE COULD BLIND
SIDE WENTWORTH.
WE THOUGHT SHE THOUGHT CIERA IS
GOING TO GO HOME.
SPLITTING THE VOTES IS HIGHLY
COMPLEX.
IT CAN GO VERY, VERY WRONG.
WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM AND
SAID, DOES ANYONE THINK SHE'S
GOT AN IDOL?
WE THOUGHT, NOT A CHANCE.
SHE'S GOT THESE LITTLE SPANX, WE
WOULD HAVE SAW IT, SHE WOULD
HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY.
THE INFORMATION AT THE TIME,
NOBODY THOUGHT.
 Jeff: NOW FISHBACH, IN YOUR
CASE, YOU DO SPLIT THE VOTE WITH
ENORMOUS CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU
TRIED TO VOTE OUT JOE, AND IT
DIDN'T WORK.
 YEAH TO, SAVAGE'S POINT,
THERE'S SO LITTLE INFORMATION
THAT WE HAVE.
AND I THINK THAT'S OFTEN
SOMETHING THAT GETS LOST THROUGH
THE TV SCREEN.
YOU KNOW, WE... YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO HAS AN IDOL.
I THOUGHT JOE ABSOLUTELY HAD AN
IDOL.
I THOUGHT HE HAD TWO.
HE COULD TO HAVE HAD 15 IDOLS.
YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHO IS WITH
YOU.
I THOUGHT SPENCER WITH WITH ME.
 Jeff: FISHBACH, LET'S GET
TO THE JOE THING, YES OR NO,
WERE YOU TOO FIXATED?
YOU CAME OUT QUOTING "MOBY
DICK," THE WHALE ATE YOU, JUST
LIKE THE BOOK.
 LOOK AT HIM, AMERICA'S
FIXATED ON HIM, HOW COULD I NOT
BE?
THIS GUY IS THE GOLDEN BOY.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT.
HE'S THE STAR, IF YOU LET HIM
GET TO THE END...
 Jeff: WAS THAT YOUR MISTAKE
IN THE GAME, FISHBACH, THAT YOU
DIDN'T STEP BACK AND RESEE THE
EYES ON THE PRIZE SO TO SPEAK?
 I THINK ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
MOMENT AND THIS GOLDEN BOY...
THIS WAS MY SECOND CHANCE STORY
IN MY MIND.
I LOST MY FIRST TIME TO THE
GOLDEN BOY, AND HERE HE IS.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.
HE'S FINALLY VULNERABLE, HOW DO
I NOT TAKE THAT SHOT?
HOW DO I NOT TRY?
 Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING ONCE
YOU GET RID OF JOE YOU'RE GOOD
TO GO?
 I THINK PROBLEM WITH THAT,
ONCE J.T. IS GONE I BECOME YOUR
J.T., AND IF I GO, THEN HE
BECOMES YOUR J.T. OR SHE BECOMES
YOUR J.T., SO IT'S A CYCLE OF
J.T.s.
 Jeff: JEFF VARNER, EXPLAIN
TO ME WHY VOTING BLOCS EVOLVED
THIS SEASON?
 WELL, I MEAN, THIS IS A TOUGH
GROUP.
EVERYBODY IS GOOD.
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY'S
GAME.
NOBODY TRUSTS ANYBODY.
EVERYBODY IS ON THE EVERYBODY.
SO THE ALLIANCES DON'T WORK.
IT'S HOW IN THAT MOMENT YOU CAN
GET WITH WHOEVER YOU NEED TO GET
TO TO GET ONE MORE DAY, YOU
KNOW?
 Jeff: KELLEY, YOU HAD
ANOTHER IDOL THAT YOU MADE THERE
AT THE END.
I GOT TO SAY, ONE OF OUR
PROUDEST MOMENTS FROM A
PRODUCTION TEAM WAS WHEN WE
DECIDED TO HAVE THE IDOLS ALL
LOOK DIFFERENT, AND HERE IT IS,
YOU PLAY RIGHT INTO IT, YOU MAKE
ONE.
KEITH, WHY NOT PLAY THE IDOL?
 I JUST... I THOUGHT IT WAS A
CHEESY WAY TO GO OUT.
 IT'S FOR A MILLION DOLLARS,
KEITH!
 I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT LIKE
THAT.
AH, HECK...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: KEITH, WHERE DOES
THAT... ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I
GOT ON THE STREET A LOT OTHER
THAN DO YOU HAVE JOE'S NUMBER...
[LAUGHTER]
WAS HOW DOES KEITH... YOU HAVE
THIS CRAZY ABILITY TO BALANCE
AND JUGGLE AND TWIST AND FALL.
 I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT JUST... IT'S
CHALLENGES I'M GOOD AT,
BALANCING, LIKE YOU SAID.
I CAN'T...
 BALL SAVVINESS.
I CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS JEREMY OR
JUMP AS HIGH.
 Jeff: AND YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT
TIMES ON THE SEASON.
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING YOUR
TAKE ON "SURVIVOR," BECAUSE YOU
REALLY DON'T THINK "SURVIVOR" IS
FUN.
 I DON'T.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT FUN.
IT'S A HECK OF AN ADVENTURE, A
HECK OF AN ADVENTURE, BUT FUN?
NO.
 Jeff: HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO
TRULY GETTING UP AT THAT
HISTORIC TRIBAL AND SAYING,
KIMMI, YOU CAN GO?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS THE THING
TO DO, RIGHT THING TO DO.
 Jeff: DOES THAT MAKE YOU
EMOTIONAL?
 LITTLE BIT.
I MEAN, HECK.
 WE'VE ALL BEEN EMOTIONAL
TODAY.
WE'VE ALL BEEN EMOTIONAL.
 Jeff: AND KIMMI, YOU HAD TO
BE THINKING, KEITH, JUSTWALK TO
YOUR TORCH, JUST WALK TO YOUR
TORCH.
 I WANTED TO BE THERE, BUT I
MADE A DECISION TO OWN MY GAME
AND TRY SOMETHING, BECAUSE
NOBODY WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE
END.
AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH THE
CONSEQUENCES OF MY CHANCE.
I MEAN, THIS WAS ALL ABOUT
CHANCES AND TIMING.
 Jeff: YOU WERE RIGHT, YOU
TRIED TO TAKE OUT JEREMY.
YOUR INSTINCTS WERE RIGHT.
 UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T HAVE
THE OUTCOME I WANTED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
UP NEXT, A PLAYER SO POPULAR,
KIDS WANT TO BE HIM, WOMEN WANT
TO DATE HIM --
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
-- AND GUYS JUST WANT THE HANG
OUT WITH HIM.
JOE, HE'S SO DELICIOUS, HE EVEN
HAS HIS OWN CAKE POP.
LOOK AT THAT.
MAN BUN.
NO MAN BUN.
WE'LL TALK TO JOE WHEN WE COME
BACK.
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE"
REUNION.
NICE SHOT OF
WOO.
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT.
WE'RE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
JEREMY, I'M JUST LOOKING AT YOU
IN THAT SEAT THINKING, YOU GOT
$1 MILLION IN YOUR POCKET.
OR ACTUALLY DOES VAL HAVE IT?
 MAN, I TOLD YOU BEFORE VAL,
GETS IT.
 Jeff: MY BAD.
ALL RIGHT, SPENCER, SO THE FIRST
TIME YOU PLAY, AND YOU AND I
HAVE A HISTORY BECAUSE I DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN YOU FIRST
TIME YOU PLAYED.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRASH AND
ARROGANT AND SAW PEOPLE LIKE
CHESS PIECES, AND YOU REALLY
SWAYED ME.
WE WANTED YOU TO COME BACK.
WE'RE SO HAPPY YOU GOT VOTED
INCH YOU HAD A REALLY CLEAR
DIRECTION.
YOU WANTED TO GROW AS A HUMAN.
YOU WERE VERY VULNERABLE IN
LETTING US WATCH.
WHAT IS THAT LIKE FOR YOU TO
COME HOME AND WATCH IT?
 IT'S A MIXED BAG.
IT'S... THE VULNERABILITY
ACTUALLY WAS THE GOOD PART OF
IT.
I WAS HAPPY TO SEE MYSELF
EMOTIONAL.
I WAS HAPPY TO SEE MYSELF
POLITICIAN A GAME THAT I DIDN'T
PLAY BEFORE, SOMETHING NEW IN
MYSELF.
I THINK THE BAD WAS JUST THE
SECOND-GUESSING AND THE
REGRETTING DECISIONS.
I LEFT THAT TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND
I SAID, I HAVE 0% CHANCE OF
WINNING THIS GAME.
I DEFINITELY JUST KICKING MYSELF
FOR A LOT OF DECISIONS.
 Jeff: YOU SAID SOMETHING TO
ME A FEW DAYS AGO THAT YOU
ACTUALLY STOPPED WATCHING THE
SHOW.
 YEAH.
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S LIKE I HAVE THIS JOB THAT I
LOVE.
I HAVE MY GIRLFRIEND I LOVE.
AND I WANTED TO JUST FOCUS ON
THAT, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH
STEPHEN GETTING VOTED OWN AND
SAID, SHOULD HAVE VOTED OUT
JEREMY.
AND WATCH JOE GETTING VOTED OUT,
SHOULD HAVE VOTED OUT JEREMY.
BASICALLY I DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO
THE END WITH THIS GUY.
SO IT'S A LOT OF SECOND GUSING,
AND I WANTED TO... IT'S FIRST
TIME AS A SUPER FAN THAT I THINK
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO
REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF
OBSESSING OVER "SURVIVOR," TAKE
A STEP BACK.
 Jeff: SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
LOOKING AT THAT?
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
COME UP TO ME AND SAID, I LIKE
SPENCER BECAUSE HE'S LETTING ME
WATCH HIM TRY TO BECOME A BETTER
PERSON.
DO YOU THINK YOU'VE SUCCEEDED IN
THAT GROWTH?
 YEAH, I GREW.
I THINK THAT I DID THINGS, I
BUILT RELATIONSHIPS THAT I
COULDN'T HAVE BUILT IN CAGAYAN,
AND THAT ALLOWED KNOW MAKE MOVES
AND PLAY A GAME THAT I COULDN'T
HAVE PLAYED IN CAGAYAN.
I EXPRESSED MYSELF IN WAYS THEY
NEVER COULD HAVE BEFORE.
 Jeff: YOU TOLD YOUR
GIRLFRIEND THAT YOU LOVED HER.
 AND I DO STILL TODAY.
I LOVE YOU.
 Jeff: WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOU SHARING YOUR STORY LIKE
THAT.
IT'S YET ANOTHER REASON THIS
SEASON CONNECTED WITH PEOPLE.
WE REALLY DID INVEST IN YOU GUYS
AND WE WANTED TO WATCH YOUR
STORIES COME TO LIFE.
EVERY SO OFTEN A PLAYER COMES
AROUND THAT CONNECTS WITH
EVERYBODY, AND I MEAN EVERYBODY.
 JOE.
AWESOME, JOB.
 JOE IS JUST INCREDIBLE.
HE'S PERFECT.
 HE'S "SURVIVOR" MACGYVER.
 JOE IS REALLY GOOD.
 I WAS A LITTLE DISTRACTED
LOOKING AT JOE'S BODY.
 Jeff: JOE, ONE OF THE MOST
FIERCE COMPETITORS IN THE GAME,
THE GOLDEN BOY.
 I CAN DO ANYTHING I PUT MY
MIND TO.
 Jeff: JOE WINS HIS FOURTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, REMAINS
UNDEFEATED.
 YOU OKAY?
 GOOD LUCK, Y'ALL.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: LET ME READ A FEW
STATS FROM JOE'S TIME IN THE
GAME.
SAFE IN THE GAME FOR 28 DAYS.
THAT IS A RECORD.
WON SIX TRIBE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES IN A ROW, TIED WITH
KEITH.
WON FOUR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITIES,
WHICH IS ONE SHY OF THE RECORD.
RANKS THIRD IN THE MOST
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WINS BEHIND
BOSTON ROB AND OZY, BUT THEY
PLAYED MORE SEASONS THAN YOU,
AND BECAUSE OF A GREAT TWIST,
YOU WERE FIRST PLAYER INELIGIBLE
TO VOTE AT TRIBAL DUE TO HIS
VOTE BEING STOLEN BY FISHBACH.
SO, JOE, WOO RIGHT BEHIND YOU
WENT THROUGH THIS TOO WHEN KIDS
JUST ADORE YOU, BUT THIS REALLY
EXPLODED.
WHAT IS THAT LIKE REALLY TO BE
JUST A GUY, YOU'RE JUST A DUDE.
YOU END UP ON "SURVIVOR" AND
SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE YOU GO IT'S
JOE, JOE, JOE, JOE, JOE.
 IT'S OVERWHELMING.
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S STILL SURREAL.
I AM JUST A NORMAL GUY.
I GREW UP WATCHING THE SHOW.
I REMEMBER BEING THAT KID THAT
WAS WATCHING BOSTON ROB AND
OZZIE AND GOING, OH, MY GOSH,
THAT'S GOING TO BE ME SOME DAY.
I DREAMT THAT.
 Jeff: AND NOW THERE ARE
KIDS, A LOT OF THEM RIGHT HERE
TONIGHT IN OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE
SAYING, I WANT TO BE JOE.
 I LOVE THEM.
AND WHAT'S COOL IS ALL OF YOU
GUYS CAN PLAY THIS GAME.
LIKE YOU CAN DO THIS.
AND YOU CAN DO THIS IN YOUR LIFE
AND IN "SURVIVOR."
YOU CAN GO OUT AND CONQUER
ANYTHING YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO.
SO THAT'S WHAT'S COOL ABOUT...
IT'S GOAL SETTING, IT'S SEEING
THAT AND MANIFESTING WHATEVER
YOU WANT.
 Jeff: SPEAKING OF
MANIFESTING, REALLY INTERESTING
STORY WITH YOU IN THAT FIRST
TIME YOU PLAYED, YOUR GOAL WAS
TO GET YOUR DAD TO THE LOVED
ONE, AND YOU FELL SHORT.
THIS TIME YOU JUST MADE IT.
YOU GOT YOUR DAD TO THE LOVED
ONE, AND HE TOLD YOU HE LOVED
YOU.
SO WHAT WAS THAT LIKE TO SEE
THAT INTIMATE MOMENT, BECAUSE HE
SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER
TOLD YOU THIS, BUT I LOVE YOU,
AND HE DOES IT IN FRONT OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
 MY DAD WAS TOUGH ON ME.
IT WAS TOUGH LOVE.
WE ALWAYS RESPECTEDDED EACH
OTHER.
I RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF MY
DAD, BUT OVER TIME WE HAD TO
DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP.
 Jeff: SO DID THIS BRING YOU
CLOSER?
 I MEAN, THIS THIS IS THE .. I
SAY IT'S LIKE THE PLATEAU.
THIS HAS BROUGHT MY FAMILY SO
CLOSE TOGETHER.
IT'S DONE TREMENDOUS THINGS FOR
OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND, YEAH, IT
WAS GREAT.
IT WAS AN AMAZING THING TO BRING
HIS DREAM, MY DREAM TO FRUITION.
AND IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT.
I KNOW WE'RE BOTH GOING TO
TREASURE IT FOREVER.
 Jeff: GOOD.
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
[APPLAUSE]
AND JUST TO PUT INTO CONTEXT HOW
POPULAR JOE IS, WHEN JOE GOT
VOTED OUT, OKAY, GLENN, BIG WIDE
SHOT.
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE
GAME AT THAT TIME GOT HATE MAIL
FOR VOTING JOE OUT?
ABI, JOE GETS ALL THE LOVE.
YOU GET ALL THE HATE.
 BUT I DO GET A LOT OF LOVE,
TOO.
I GET SOME HATE, BUT I DO GET A
LOT OF LOVE, TOO.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVED THAT I
VOTED HIM OUT.
 IT'S A GOOD MOVE.
 Jeff: DO YOU FEEL YOU WERE
SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR SECOND-CHANCE
STORY IN TRYING TO BECOME EASIER
TO GET ALONG WITH?
 I THINK I AM MY WORST ENEMY,
JEFF, UNFORTUNATELY.
THAT'S THE PURE TRUTH.
 [INAUDIBLE]
[LAUGHTER]
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE
OF THESE GUYS, YOUR FAVORITE
SURVIVORS, JOE, ABI, WHOEVER,
THERE IS A REALLY COOL ONLINE
SERIES WE PRODUCE CALLED
"PONDEROSA."
IT'S LIFE AFTER YOU'RE VOTED
OUT.
IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THE SHOW
WHERE EACH WEEK ANOTHER
VOTED-OUT PERSON JOINS PONDEROSA
AND THEY ALL LIVE TOGETHER.
SO IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE, SAY,
SAVAGE, AND HE'S AT POND ROW
CENTENNIAL PARK AND THE PERSON
WHO BLIND SIDED YOU, WENTWORTH,
ARRIVES.
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.
YOU CAN CHECK OUT ALL THE
EPISODES.
STILL TO COME, ANOTHER REALLY
BIG MOMENT THIS SEASON IS WHEN
TERRY DIETZ LEFT THE GAME FOR
FAMILY EMERGENCY.
THIS IS A REAL SECOND-CHANCE
STORY THAT WILL TOUCH EVERYBODY.
 PEOPLE SAY "SURVIVOR" IS FUN,
IT IS POURING.
I TELL THEM HELL NO.
 Anchor: YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE FREEZING.
 I AM FREEZING.
 IT'S REAL.
 WE KNOW.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK.
WELL, IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" IN ADDITION
TO MOTHER NATURE.
WE HAD SOME TRULY DRAMATIC
MEDICAL MOMENTS.
TASHA, TAKE ME BACK TO IN THE
WATER, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE REAL
DEAL, RIGHT?
 THAT WAS THE REAL DEAL, JEFF.
AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME, I
THINK WE'RE ALL DEHYDRATED.
WE'RE STARVING.
AND AS YOU SAW WITH JOE, YOUR
BODY JUST GIVES OUT.
YOUR MIND IS WILLING YOU...
 Jeff: LOOKING AT THE
FOOTAGE OF IT, YOU WERE
DROWNING.
 I WAS LITERALLY DROWNING.
 Jeff: TO BE CLEAR TO OUR
AUDIENCE, WE HAVE SAFETY
SWIMMERS ALWAYS AROUND THE
PERIMETER, BUT I'M SURE TO YOU
THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE A
MILE AWAY.
 I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE
COMING FROM ME, JEFF.
 Jeff: WE'RE ALWAYS
WATCHING.
JOE, TAKE US BACK TO THE MOMENT
WHEN YOU FELL, BECAUSE I THINK
FOR EVERYBODY THAT WAS OUT
THERE, INCLUDING MYSELF, I
DIDN'T REALIZE YOU PASSED OUT.
I THOUGHT YOU JUST FELL AND YOU
WERE DONE.
 NO, I WAS... I THINK TASH HIT
IT.
YOU'RE JUST... EVERYTHING YOU'RE
PUTTING INTO THE GAME, MENTALLY,
EMOTIONALLY, PHYSICALLY, IS NOW
GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE YOUR
BODY IS JUST GOING TO START TO
BREAK DOWN.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT
IT.
I WAS SEEING STARS.
I WAS SEEING BLACK, HANDS, LEGS
WERE STARTING TO GO NUMB.
 Jeff: DO YOU REMEMBER ME
TALKING TO YOU?
 I REMEMBER ME AND YOU TALKING
RIGHT BEFORE I PASSED OUT, AND
THEN I REMEMBER YOU TALKING TO
DR. JOE, BUT IT WAS LIKE I WAS
UNDERWATER.
IT WAS LIKE YOU CAN HEAR VOICE,
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING OUT.
I REMEMBER WAGING UP AND YOU
WERE HOLDING MY HAND AND DR. JOE
WAS TAKING MY VITALS AND GIVING
ME SOME GLUCOSE.
 Jeff: AND WHAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO SHOW, I'M SORRY TO
SAY, KEITH, BECAUSE WE HAD SO
MUCH HAPPENING IN THAT EPISODE,
YOU WEREN'T FAR BEHIND.
YOU WERE VERY WIPED OUT.
 VERY CLOSE, VERY CLOSE.
I WENT TO MY KNEES.
I DIDN'T PASS OUT.
BUT I WAS EXHAUSTED.
YEAH.
 Jeff: WELL, BETH OF THOSE
MOMENTS CAME, WE TALKED TO THE
DOCTOR A LOT OUT THERE, FROM
LITERALLY PUSHING THE BODY
FURTHER THAN IT WANTS TO GO
UNTIL YOUR BRAIN KICKS IN AND
SAYS, I GOT TO DROP YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE.
THAT IS COMMITMENT TO THE GAME.
WE SAW A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF
COMMITMENT WHEN I HAD TO WAKE UP
TERRY DIETZ TO TELL HIM THERE
WAS FAMILY EMERGENCY.
TERRY, I JUST GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM YOUR WIFE.
 MY BOY DANNY ENDED UP BEING
HOSPITALIZED.
 OH, TERRY.
 Jeff: SO TERRY, LET'S JUST
BE CLEAR, WHEN YOU LEFT, YOUR
SON WAS NOT SICK.
 NO, NO SYMPTOMS.
 Jeff: SO I COME, I WAKE YOU
UP, IMMEDIATELY YOU SAID, I GOT
IT, LET ME GET MY PACK AND TELL
THE PEOPLE I'M OUT OF HERE.
YOU DIDN'T HESITATE.
WE GET YOU HOME AS FAST AS WE
CAN.
WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU TALK TO THE DOCTORS.
THEY TELL YOU WHAT?
 WE REALIZE DANNY IS ON HIS
DEATHBED.
HE'S GOT LEVELS WAY BELOW WHERE
OUR HEARTS NORMALLY OPERATE.
AND A HEART TRANSPLANT IS A
POSSIBILITY.
 Jeff: SO WHEN DO YOU FIND
OUT, WHEN DO THE DOCTORS TELL
YOU, OKAY, IT'S REAL, HE NEEDS A
TRANSPLANT?
 ABOUT A MONTH INTO IT WE
FOUND OUT IT WAS A GENETIC ISSUE
AND HIS HEART WAS NOT GOING TO
GET BETTER.
IT WAS THE WORST DAY OF OUR
LIVES, ESPECIALLY DAN YES'S,
KNOWING THAT DAY HE WENT ON THE
HEART TRANSPLANT LIST ON JULY
11th.
 Jeff: SO WHAT, YOU JUST
START WAITING?
 WE GO HOME ON A BRIDGE TO
TRANSPLANT.
THAT DIDN'T QUITE WORK.
A MONTH, AUGUST 11th, HE HAS
AN ELECTRICAL PUMP PUT INTO HIS
HEART TO PUMP THE BLOOD AROUND
HIS BODY.
THAT'S CALLED A VENTRICULAR
ASSIST DEVICE.
HE HAD A MONTH ON THAT AS A
BRIDGE TO TRANSPLANT.
DR. DALY, WHO IS SITTING OUT
HERE TONIGHT, CALLS US UP AND
SAYS, I DON'T HAVE A HEART, I
HAVE THE HEART FOR DANNY, A
PERFECT MATCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: HOW LONG WAS THAT?
WHAT DAY WAS THAT?
 THREE MONTHS UNTIL HE HAD
BEEN ORIGINALLY ADMITTED AND TWO
MONTHS ON THE LIST.
HE BEAT THE BELL CURVE.
WE'RE SO BLESSED AND SO LUCKY.
 Jeff: WOW.
I WANT TO...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I WANT TO POP OUT HERE AND
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE REAL HERO
IN THE STORY.
DANNY AND HIS MOM TRISH, WHO I'M
SURE DID A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING.
STAND UP, GUYS.
WHILE DIETZ WAS OUT THERE.
WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE,
BUDDY.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: SO WALK ME THROUGH IT
FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW.
WHAT DOES THIS DO TO A CLEARLY
TIGHT FAMILY, AND TRISH, FOR
YOU, AS WELL, FROM THE MOM'S
POINT OF VIEW, THIS HAS TO BRING
YOU GUYS CLOSER.
 WELL, YEAH, WE WERE VERY
CLOSE FOR THREE MONTHS.
HE WAS SLEEPING IN MY HOSPITAL
ROOM, AND THEY WERE LIKE NOT FAR
AWAY IN A HOTEL.
 Jeff: SO IF YOUR FAMILY,
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THIS
TRAUMATIC THING, WHEN YOU COME
OUT OF IT, ARE YOU TIGHTER?
 OH, YEAH.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: AND TRISH, SORRY TO
INTERRUPT YOU, DANNY, ONE THING
TERRY WAS TELLING ME, BECAUSE WE
WERE OBVIOUSLY COMMUNICATING
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS TRYING THE
FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS WERE
GOING, IS HOW MUCH YOU TOOK ON
BEFORE HE GOT THERE.
 THAT WAS TOUGH.
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIM SOME HE
WAS PLAYING LACROSSE.
HE WAS JUST BEING A 16-YEAR-OLD
KID, BUT HE KEPT GETTING SICK
AND SO I SAID, STOP LACROSSE,
STOP EVERYTHING, WHICH AS YOU
MAY KNOW, AN ATHLETE, THEY FALL
DEAD ON THE FIELD, AND THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN DANNY.
 Jeff: SO YOUR INSTINCTS
WERE REALLY GOOD.
 I REMIND HIM OF THAT A LOT.
[LAUGHTER]
 Jeff: AND I GOT TO POINT
OUT, THE DOCTOR AND THE NURSES
WHO DID, THIS RIGHT HERE,
AMAZING JOB, SAVING LIVES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND DOCTOR, I'M SURE YOU'LL
AGREE WITH THIS, IF YOU AREN'T
ALREADY A DONOR, AFTER THE LIVE
SHOW IS OVER, HAVE THE
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FAMILY,
BECAUSE YOU TRULY CAN OUTLIVE
YOURSELF BECAUSE THE TRAGEDY IS
SOMEBODY LOST THEIR LIFE,
THEY'RE OUTLIVING THEMSELVES
RIGHT HERE IN THIS GUY.
DONATE YOUR ORGANS.
UP NEXT, WHAT ARE WE DOING NEXT
SEASON?
IT'S VERY FAMILIAR AND IT'S VERY
DIFFERENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELL, IT IS VERY
HARD, SO HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE," BUT
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT AS ONE
SEASON ENDS, ANOTHER DOES BEGIN.
TAKE A LOOK.
FOR OUR 32ND SEASON, A NEW GROUP
OF CASTAWAYS TAKE ON THE
GREATEST ADVENTURE ON
TELEVISION.
 I'VE BEEN AN ELECTRONICS
EXPERT, A CAPTAIN, A BARTENDER,
A PHOTONICS MANUFACTURING
SUPERSLIDESSER, A CHEMIST,
CARETAKER TO NUNS AND BETWEEN
JOBS A RED LOBSTER SERVER.
 I HAVE A AGREE FROM MIT AND A
PERFECT SCORE ON MY SATs.
I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZED I'M
UNUSUALLY INTELLIGENT.
 I USED TO PLAY IN THE NBA FOR
11 YEARS.
I RAN AROUND AND PUSHED PEOPLE,
AND I DID IT BETTER THAN MOST
PEOPLE,.
MY FRIENDS CALL ME CAVEMAN, LET
ALONE MY ENEMIES.
IT'S TIME FAR CAVEMAN TO WOMEN.
 I'M A WOMAN TAKING CARE OF MY
BODY, NOT JUST EATING DOUBLE
CHEESEBURGERS ALL KAY.
 I AM A GARDENER.
I LOVE ALL CREATURES.
I WANT A GAY, ASIAN, 51-YEAR-OLD
TO WIN "SURVIVOR."
 I MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE
BRAINS, BUT I DO HAVE GOOD
LOOKS.
 I AM A MAN'S MAN, BUT AT THE
SAME TIME, COUNTRY BOYS LIKE TO
DRESS UP, TOO.
IT'S A TIME FOR A COUNTRY BOY TO
SHOW ITS TRUE COLORS.
 Jeff: BUT WHAT NONE OF THEM
THOUGH -- MEDICAL, MEDICAL,
LET'S GO!
-- THEY'RE ABOUT TO FACE THE
MOST PUNISHING SEASON IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
 YOU ARE PULLING HIM FROM THE
GAME.
 MY SHOULDERS ARE JUST
DESTROYED.
 Jeff: WE'RE RIGHT HERE WITH
YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
STAY WITH US.
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WE HAVE AN EVACUATION.
CALL FOR THE CHOPPER.
BRAIN VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS
BEAUTY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.
SURVIVOR: BRAINS, BRAWN AND
BEAUTY PIERCE IN FEBRUARY.
MORE "SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE"
AFTER THIS.
 Jeff: I LOVE HOW MANY KIDS
LOVE THIS SHOW.
DURING THE BREAK LITTLE AVA, A
LITTLE GIRL CAME DOWN AND GAVE
US THIS PAINTING.
KIDS, KEEP WATCHING.
YOU CAN BE ON "SURVIVOR" ONE
DAY.
IF YOU WANT THE PLAY "SURVIVOR,"
FIRST STEP IS YOU GOT TO SHOW US
WHO YOU ARE.
A LOT OF YOU ARE SENDING VIDEOS
ON TWITTER, TOO.
THAT'S COOL.
IF YOU WANT TO OWN A PIECE OF
"SURVIVOR," BID ON PROPS FROM
THIS SEASON FOR "SURVIVOR"
AUCTIONS DOT COM.
PROCEEDS WILL GO TO THE DANNY
STRONG FUND AT BOSTON CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL TO HELP KIDS JUST LIKE
CARRIE'S SON DANNY.
BIDDING STARTS AFTER THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOYALTY.
WE LOVE DOING THIS SHOW.
WE LOVE THAT YOU KEEP WATCHING,
AND WE'LL KEEP MAKING THEM FOR
YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.
