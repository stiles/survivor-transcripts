CBS TELEVISION CITY, FOR THE
TWO-HOUR SEASON FINALE OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE."
YOU CAN TELL WE ARE AT MAXIMUM
CAPACITY.
THIS IS THE HOTTEST SEASON PI
UNTILLY TICKET WE'VE EVER HAD,
AND FOR GOOD REASON.
THIS SEASON FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER WE TURN THE SHOW OVER TO








YOU AND YOU, THE FANS.
YOU DECIDED WHO WAS GOING TO
PLAY, AND I GOT TO SAY, YOU
CHOSE VERY WELL.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GROUP.
LET'S GO IN THE GREEN ROOM.
IT'S LIKE A "SURVIVOR" DREAM
TEAM IN THERE, AND THEY PLAYED
HARD IN DAY ONE, RESULTING IN
ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE,
UNPREDICTABLE, ENTERTAINING
SEASONS WE'VE EVER SEEN, AND
ACCORDING TO THIS CROWD, MAYBE
THE BEST.








WE HAVE A BIG UPDATE TONIGHT,
TOO, ON TERRY DIETZ AND HIS SON
DANNY, WHO IS RECOVERING FROM A
HEART TRANSPLANT, IT IS AN
AMAZING STORY, PART OF AN
AMAZING SEASON.
REACHED OUT TO ME ON TWITTER.
USE #SURVIVORFINALE SO WE CAN
FIND IT.
IT IS TIME TO WRAP UP WITH A
KILLER FINAL EPISODE THAT IS
ALSO HISTORIC.
YOU GUYS GOT QUIET AT THE
PERFECT TIME.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, WHICH
AFTER 31 SEASONS IS SAYING
SOMETHING.
THEN WE HAVE OUR LIVE REUNION
SHOW, AND IT WILL MOVE YOU TO
TEARS.
THREE HOURS OF "SURVIVOR"
TONIGHT, YOUR LAST EPISODE UNTIL
NEXT SEASON.
CALL YOUR FRIENDS AND SETTLE
INCH HERE -- SETTLE IN.
HERE WE GO!
IN THE HEART OF CAMBODIA, 20
RETURNING PLAYERS BEGAN AN EPIC
BATTLE FOR $1 MILLION.
AND FROM THE BEGINNING, IT WAS
CLEAR THIS SEASON WOULD BE LIKE
NOTHING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
MULTIPLE SWITCHES TURNED THE
GAME UPSIDE DOWN.
WE ARE SWITCH FROM TWO TRIBES TO
THREE TRIBES.
 SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.
 IT IS A CLUSTER EXPLETIVE.
 Jeff: FINDING EVERY HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL REQUIRED MASSIVE
RISK.
 I LOVE IT.
 Jeff: BRUTAL WEATHER
POUNDED EVEN THE MOST SEASONED
PLAYERS.
 MY BODY IS BREAKING DOWN.
I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS,
LITERALLY I JUST CAN'T.
 Jeff: AND AN ENDLESS STREAM
OF DEVASTATING TRIBAL COUNCILS
CONSTANTLY FLIPPED THE GAME.
 I MAY BE ON THE BOTTOM, BUT
I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME YET.
 THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 Jeff: WITH BLIND SIDE AFTER
BLIND SIDE.
ABI WAS THE LATEST CASUALTY WHEN
TASHA, JEREMY, SPENCER AND KIMMI
CAME TOGETHER.
 WELL PLAYED.
 Jeff: LEAVING WENTWORTH AND
KEITH ON THE BOTTOM.
WELL, ANOTHER BLIND SIDE, THE
PERFECT SETUP FOR WHAT MIGHT
JUST BE ONE OF THE MOST
UNPREDICTABLE FINISHES IN THE
HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR."
SIX ARE LEFT.
JEREMY, HE APPEARS TO HAVE IT
ALL, A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 WE GOT NUMBER TWO.
 Jeff: AND A BOND WITH
TASHA, SPENCER AND KIMMI.
CAN HE HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER
UNTIL THE END?
OR WILL IT ALL COME CRASHING
DOWN?
 I GOT TO WIN, GET THAT MONEY
AND BRING IT HOME TO VAL AND THE
KIDS.
 Jeff: TASHA, SHE HAS
SURVIVED THE UPS AND DOWNS OF A
RIGOROUS SEASON.
CAN SHE CONTINUE TO MANEUVER HER
WAY TO THE END AND THE $1
MILLION PRIZE?
 $1 MILLION IS ON THE LINE,
AND I WILL DO AND SAY WHAT I
NEED TO TO WIN THIS GAME.
THAT'S MY STORY.
I'M STICKING TO IT.
 Jeff: KEITH, HE'S WON
MULTIPLE CHALLENGES BUT HAS
HOVERED ON THE OUTSIDE FOR
WEEKS.
HE MAY NOT BE IN THE MAJORITY,
BUT HE'S ALWAYS IN THE GAME.
 ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE GRAND
FINALE, THE GRAND PRIZE.
STICK AROUND.
COME TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.
BUY A FREE TICKET.
IT MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT
BE EPIC.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, HER SECOND
CHANCE IS SIMPLE: GO BIG OR GO
HOME.
SHE'S PLAYED ONE IDOL THAT
FLIPPED THE GAME AND HAS ONE
LEFT JUST WAITING TO STRIKE
AGAIN.
 EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GET TO
THE END TO WIN $1 MILLION, BUT
RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT STAYING
ALIVE.
 Jeff: KIMMI, HER SECOND
CHANCE HAS BEEN 15 YEARS IN THE
MAKING.
THIS TIME AROUND, SHE'S BEEN A
PART OF SEVERAL BLIND SIDES.
 SHE'S A SNAKE IN THE GRASS.
 Jeff: AND IS IN THE
MAJORITY ALLIANCE.
 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO GO
FULL FORCE BECAUSE I WANT TO GO
OUT OF HERE WITH A BANG.
 Jeff: SPENCER, FOR MOST OF
THE GAME HE WAS ON THE BOTTOM,
BUT AFTER WINNING TWO INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITIES AND FOCUSING ON HIS
SOCIAL GAME, HE FINDS HIMSELF ON
TOP.
WILL SPENCER CONTINUE TO EVOLVE,
OR WILL HE END UP WHERE HE DID
LAST TIME, SITTING ON THE JURY?
 I HAVE TO WIN THIS GAME, AND
I HAVE TO DO IT TO COMPLETE MY
SECOND-CHANCE JOURNEY.
 Jeff: FOR 35 DAYS NOTHING
HAS BEEN PREDICTABLE, AND
TONIGHT IT'S ANYONE'S GAME.
 TRIBAL.
 ANYBODY WANT TO BE SITTING
BESIDE ABI IN THE FINAL THREE?
 I WANT TO BE SITTING IN THE
FINAL THREE.
 NOBODY WOULD VOTE FOR HER.
 KEITH, WITH HER THERE...
 YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL
THREE.
 IF I DO MAKE IT, I WOULD HAVE
TO LIKE THERE WITH HER, NOT YOU,
NOT SPENCER, NOT KELLEY.
 EXACTLY.
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE ABI GO.
KEITH SAID, WELL, GOSH, WHY DID
YOU GET RID OF ABI.
I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH
ABI, NOT YOU.
 YOU JUST PROVED WHY IT MADE
SENSE TO GET RID OF ABI.
 YOU JUST SAID, I WANT HER
NEXT TO ME, NOT SPENCER.
THAT'S A REASON FOR SPENCER TO
VOTE HER OUT.
 FROM THE OUTSIDE WENTWORTH
AND KEITH LOOK LIKE LOW MEN ON
THE TOTEM POLE, BUT THIS HAS NOW
LEFT ME WITH THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO SWOOP IN AND MAKE
MY DREAMS HAPPEN.
 ME, JEREMY, TASHA AND SPENCER
VOTED TOGETHER.
 I KNOW.
 SO HOW ABOUT THIS: I TELL
THEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT
VOTES AND THAT YOU, ME AND KEITH
VOTE EITHER JEREMY OR SPENCER...
 I LIKE THIS.
VERY MUCH.
 SO THEN...
 I THINK KIMMI IS STARTING TO
REALIZE IF SHE STICKS WITH THAT
FOUR, SPENCER, TASHA, JEREMY AND
HER, SHE MAY NOT GET TO THE
FINAL THREE.
 I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT
IDEA, KIMMI.
 I KNOW.
 IT'S REALLY THE ONLY WAY.
 IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN THIS
THING, AND IF I GO WITH TASH,
JEREMY AND SPENCER, AM I REALLY
GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE END?
THAT'S PUTTING MY FATE AND
DESTINY IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HANDS.
THESE GUYS TRUST ME.
THEY'RE LETTING THEIR GUARD
DOWN, AND NOW IS MY CHANCE TO
SHINE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 FOR SURE.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
SPENCER, I'LL TAKE BACK WHAT
EVERYBODY WANTS, THE NECKLACE.
 YES.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE TO COLLECT A
SERIES OF PUZZLE STEPS.
YOU WILL RACE TO PUT THEM IN
ORDER FROM BOTTOM TO TOP
BUILDING A VERY TALL STAIRCASE.
ONCE YOU REACH THE TOP, YOU'LL
COMPLETE A SLIDE PUZZLE.
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN
FIVE SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD THERE
ARE NO SECOND-CHANCE STORIES IN
THE CHALLENGES.
EVERY CHALLENGE WILL BE FRESH
FOR EVERYBODY, WHICH MEANS THERE
IS NO LEGACY TO LIVE UP TO, ONLY
THE LEGACY YOU CREATE.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY AND A
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
FIVE, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
ONE STEP AT A TIME YOU'RE GOING
TO BUILD A GIANT STAIRCASE.
YOU CAN ONLY CARRY ONE STEP WITH
YOU, SO YOU WANT TO BE RIGHT SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AND
RE-DO IT.
EVERYBODY OFF TO A FAST, EARLY
START.
THE EARLY PIECES ARE GOING TO BE
EASY.
IT'S GOING TO GET TOUGHER THE
HIGHER YOU GO.
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIRST SECTION
DONE, YOU CAN MOVE ON TO THE
SECOND SECTION.
SPENCER COMPLETING HIS FIRST
SECTION.
TASHA, JEREMY COMPLETE THEIR
FIRST SECTION.
THEY CAN HEAD BACK TO THEIR
SECOND SECTION.
KEITH, WENTWORTH AND KIMMI HAVE
THEIR FIRST SECTIONS DONE.
NOW IT'S GOING TO START TO GET A
LITTLE TOUGHER.
YOU'RE GOING HIGHER UP, WHICH
TAKES MORE ENERGY.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THE
PIECE LOOKS LIKE AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE WRONG.
JEREMY WRONG.
GOT TO GO BACK.
IF YOU ARE WRONG, IT HAS TO GO
ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN.
IT COULD COST YOU THIS
CHALLENGE.
YOU HAVE TO BE RIGHT.
AND RIGHT ON CUE TASHA IS WRONG.
SHE HAS TO GO BACK.
SPENCER PLACES HIS LAST STEP IN
THE SECOND SECTION.
HE'S MOVING ON TO THE THIRD AND
FINAL SECTION.
SPENCER HAS BEEN LEADING FROM
THE START.
HE DESTROYED THE PUZZLE IN THE
LAST CHALLENGE.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GIVE HIM TOO
MUCH TIME IN THIS ONE.
SPENCER STILL WITH A ONE-PIECE
LEAD.
WENTWORTH AND JEREMY RIGHT
BEHIND.
KIMMI COMING BACK WITH HER FIRST
PIECE IN THIS THIRD SECTION.
HERE COMES SPENCER AGAIN.
JEREMY PASSES SPENCER TRYING TO
GET BACK IN THIS.
THERE'S SO MUCH EFFORT 36 DAYS
IN TO GO UP AND DOWN THESE
STEPS.
JEREMY'S WRONG AGAIN.
HE'S GOT TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK.
HUGE SETBACK FOR JEREMY.
IT IS SPENCER AND WENTWORTH NOW.
YOU CAN SEE THE FATIGUE EVERY
TIME YOU HAVE TO GO UP AND DOWN.
AND YET HERE COMES JEREMY AGAIN
WITH ANOTHER BURST OF ENERGY.
AND HE'S RIGHT THIS TIME.
JEREMY DOWN TO THREE STEPS LEFT.
WENTWORTH ONLY HAS TWO LEFT.
SPENCER HAS HIS FINAL STEP.
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE,
SPENCER.
SPENCER HAS A HISTORY IN THIS
GAME OF DOING VERY WELL AT
PUZZLES.
WENTWORTH HAS HER FINAL STEP.
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
IT IS SPENCER AND WENTWORTH NOW.
HERE COMES JEREMY WITH HIS FINAL
STEP.
JEREMY CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
KEITH NOW COMING BACK, LITERALLY
USING THE STEPS LIKE A CRUTCH TO
GET TO THE TOP.
KEITH CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
IF HE CAN MAKE IT THERE.
KEITH IS ALMOST CRAWLING, LEGS
CRAMPING.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 36
DAYS IN THIS GAME.
TASHA BACK WITH HER FINAL STEP.
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
KIMMI GOING AFTER HER FINAL
STEP.
EVERYBODY IS IN IT NOW.
SPENCER MAKING A LOT OF
PROGRESS, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S
THOSE LAST FEW PIECES THAT
REALLY MAKE IT TOUGH.
HERE COMES KIMMI.
SHE'S CRAWLING TO THE FINISH.
GREAT EFFORT.
START WORKING ON YOUR PUZZLE.
RIGHT NOW IT IS SPENCER AND
WENTWORTH BACK AND FORTH.
SPENCER DOING WHAT HE DID IN
BRAINS, BRAWN, AND BEAUTY,
STOPPING TO STUDY THE PUZZLE AS
IF IT'S A CHESSBOARD.
WENTWORTH IS USING THAT TIME TO
CATCH UP.
IT WOULD BE SPENCER'S THIRD
INDIVIDUAL WIN.
IT WOULD BE WENTWORTH'S SECOND.
SPENCER SEEMS TO BE GETTING
CLOSER.
IS HE?
SPENCER THINKS HE HAS IT.
SPENCER HAS IT.
SPENCER WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, THIRD WIN THIS SEASON!
 GOOD JOB, SPENCE.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCER.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: SPENCER ONCE AGAIN
VICTORIOUS.
COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCER.
 Jeff: FOR THE THIRD TIME
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT, GUARANTEED
A ONE IN FIVE SHOT AT WINNING
THIS GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, IT HAS
BEEN 36 VERY TOUGH SECOND-CHANCE
DAYS.
ONE OF YOU GOING HOME TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 KEITH AND I ARE ON THE OUTS.
I'M PUTTING ALL MY TRUST IN
KIMMI.
IF WE LET TASHA, SPENCER AND
JEREMY GET FAR IN THIS GAME, WE
ARE SCREWED.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCER.
 THANKS.
 GOOD JOB.
 GOOD JOB.
 THAT WAS BRUTAL.
 SPENCER DOES IT AGAIN.
 MY BOY SPENCER WINS IMMUNITY
AGAIN.
AS LONG AS SPENCER IS WINNING,
THAT MEANS KEITH ISN'T.
THAT MEANS WENTWORTH ISN'T.
AND I WANT KEITH AND WENTWORTH
GONE.
KIMMI, ME, JEREMY, SPENCER FINAL
FOUR, DONE.
 DON'T FORGET YOU'RE GOING TO
HELP ME GRAB A WATER.
 YOU WANT TO GET ONE?
 YEAH, YEAH.
 YOU GUYS GOOD?
YOU GOT IT?
 I THINK SO.
 IT'S OBVIOUS -- ME, TASHA,
JEREMY, AND SPENCER.
WE HAVE BEEN VOTING FOUR.
THIS IS HOW IT'S BEEN.
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'RE GOING TO
SPLIT VOTES BECAUSE THEY DON'T
KNOW IF YOU OR WENTWORTH HAVE AN
IDOL.
HOWEVER, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IS YOU, ME AND WENTWORTH ARE
VOTING FOR JEREMY.
WE ARE BLIND SIDING JEREMY.
 WENTWORTH LAST NIGHT ASKED TO
TALK WITH KEITH JUST NOW.
IF SHE THINKS MORE THAN JUST ONE
OF US WOULD BEAT HER, THEN SHE'S
GOING TO JUMP OVER THERE.
 THEY WOULD NOT EXPECT IT.
 AND NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW
THIS.
 NOBODY.
ME, YOU, WENTWORTH VOTE FOR
JEREMY.
THAT'S IT.
 RIGHT NOW IT'S ME OR KELLEY,
BUT THIS DEAL KIMMI COME UP WITH
COULD BE THE BIG ONE.
COULD BE THE BIG ONE, AND I'M
ALL ABOUT IT.
DOES WENTWORTH...
 WENTWORTH, YES.
SHE TOLD ME SHE'S FULLY ON
BOARD.
SHE SAID IT'S BRILLIANT.
 YOU SAW WENTWORTH WENT BACK
THERE AND JOINED THEM.
 DID SHE?
 WENTWORTH, KEITH AND KIMMI
ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK IT MAKES HER FEEL
GOOD TO PLAY.
 WHAT YOU DOING, GIRL?
 OKAY.
I JUST EXPLAINED IT.
 OKAY, BUT WE TELL THE
OTHERS...
 I SAY I'M VOTING FOR YOU.
 I'M GOING TO SAY IT'S YOU.
 KEITH, KIMMI AND I HAVE IT IN
THE BAG.
WE VOTE FOR JEREMY AND IT'S
OVER.
I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THE IDOL,
AND I HAVE AN IDOL FINAL FIVE.
KIMMI CAME TO ME WITH THIS
JEREMY PLAN.
AND SHE KNOWS IF SHE DOESN'T GET
RID OF HIM, SHE MAY NOT HAVE
ANOTHER CHANCE.
IT'S JUST WILL SHE EXECUTE?
 WE CAN'T RISK AN IDOL RUINING
IT, RIGHT?
 THE GIRLS ON KEITH, THE BOYS
ON WENTWORTH.
 SOUNDS GOOD.
 LET'S KEEP EACH OTHER
INFORMED ON WHAT THEY MIGHT TRY.
I GUESS THEY'RE JUST GOING
AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HOPING
IT'S NOT THEM.
 WE'RE STILL WORRIED ABOUT AN
IDOL OUT THERE, SO LET'S SPLIT
THE VOTE TO TAKE OUT KELLEY OR
KEITH.
WE'RE ALL SAFE AND WE'RE STILL
GOING IN TOMORROW WITH NUMBERS.
 WHAT'S UP?
 HER PLAN, YOU KNOW HER PLAN,
RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SURE, BUT
I BELIEVE HER PLAN IS TO MAKE US
SPLIT THIS VOTE AND TEAM UP WITH
WENTWORTH AND KEITH AND VOTE OUT
YOU OR YOU.
 YES.
 WE THREE CAN'T SPLIT.
SPLITTING THE VOTE IS GREAT IF
YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE YOU CAN
TRUST.
 ARE THEY GOING TO SPLIT?
 YEP, YEP.
 IF KIMMI BETRAYS THE FOUR
THAT JUST VOTED TOGETHER,
WHERE'S THE MAJORITY?
 I THINK YOU'RE PARANOID.
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE...
 SHE'S LYING, MAN.
 MY VOTING BLOC IS SCEPTICAL
OF KIMMI.
I DON'T THINK KIMMI IS TRYING TO
DO ANYTHING.
 WE'RE ALL BUGGING OUT RIGHT
NOW.
DID YOU TELL KEITH ANYTHING?
 THE ONLY THING I TOLD HIM WAS
VOTING FOR WENTWORTH.
 BECAUSE OUR GAMES ARE ON THE
LINE.
IF YOU'RE JUMPING, IT'S GOING TO
MESS UP EVERYTHING.
 NO, THAT'S ALL I HAVE SAID.
I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU.
I'VE SHOWED YOU TIME AND TIME
AGAIN.
IT'S US FOUR.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS SAID.
 I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE YOU.
STOP GETTING EMOTIONAL, GIRL.
 I'M A WOMAN AND IT'S THE END
OF THIS GAME, AND THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT SHOULDN'T BE
HAPPENING.
 I BELIEVE YOU.
RELAX.
I BELIEVE YOU.
 YOU NOW, THIS IS... I STILL
GOT THIS.
OH, MY GOSH, I WOULD NEVER GO
AND TURN ON YOU GUYS.
WE'RE TOGETHER.
I MEAN, COME ON.
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE BOTTOM
OF A FOURSOME, AND THAT'S WHERE
I AM WITH SPENCER AND JEREMY AND
TASHA.
I'M NOT STUPID.
 IT'S A TURNING POINT IN THE
GAME.
 I FEEL LIKE MY ALLIANCE IS
STRONG.
THE PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS THAT
WITH A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, IT
SHAKES UP EVERYTHING.
WE DON'T WANT THE LOSE THIS.
WE HAVE NUMBERS.
WE COULD REALLY RUN THIS TO THE
END.
I KNOW KIMMI IS KIND OF GOOFY
AND EVERYTHING, BUT I REALLY
THINK SHE'S WITH US.
AND I DON'T WANT THE USE MY IDOL
AND NOT HAVE IT TOMORROW, SO I
MEAN THE SAFE THING IS SPLIT THE
VOTE, GUYS VOTE FOR WENTWORTH,
GIRLS VOTED FOR KEITH.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS AN IDOL.
I DON'T KNOW IF KEITH HAS AN
IDOL, BUT I DON'T WANT TO RISK
IT.
 WE CANNOT SPLIT A VOTE.
YOU, ME AND TASHA HAVE TO
PROBABLY ALL THREE VOTE
WENTWORTH.
 I'M TRYING TO BE SAFER.
 WENTWORTH DOESN'T HAVE AN
IDOL, MAN.
 WHY NOT?
SHE FOUND ONE BEFORE.
 MANY PEOPLE FOUND ONE BEFORE.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I BELIEVE YOU
HAVE AN IDOL RIGHT NOW.
 THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
 THAT'S A SAD REASON TO THINK
YOU HAVE AN IDOL.
I THINK JEREMY MIGHT HEAR THE
FOOTSTEPS OF WENTWORTH
POTENTIALLY HAVING AN IDOL, BUT
SPLITTING THE VOTE CAN CAUSE A
LOT MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT CAN
HELP, AND, YEAH, I'M A LITTLE
BIASED.
MY ASS ISN'T ON THE LINE.
 YOU'RE NOT GIVING.
YOU GOT TO GIVE.
 YOU'RE NOT EITHER.
WHAT WE DECIDE TONIGHT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S
FIVE, THREE CAN CONTROL THIS
GAME, AND WE CAN DICTATE A PATH
TO THE FINAL THREE.
IF WE DECIDE WRONG, WE MIGHT
STAY FOR A LONG TIME, WITH WE
HAD IT, IT WAS RIGHT THERE,
FINAL THREE, AND WE MADE THE
WRONG CALL.
 Anchor: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH,
CIERA, FISHBACH, JOE AND ABI
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
JEREMY, YOU'VE MADE IT DEEP IN
THE GAME, BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE
YET.
CAN YOU FEEL IT TIGHTENING
AROUND YOU AT EACH DECISION
BECOMES MORE MAGNIFIED?
 THIS WHOLE GAME HAS BEEN
VOTING BLOCS, AND IT'S TIGHTNING
UP INTO MORE OF ALLIANCES NOW.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, I THINK
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
ANYONE HAS SAID, YES, THERE ARE
ALLIANCES.
 YEAH, IT'S CLEAR AFTER THE
LAST VOTE THAT KEITH AND I ARE
OFF BY OURSELVES AND TASHA,
JEREMY, SPENCER AND KIMMI ARE A
TIGHT GROUP.
 Jeff: TASHA, RING TRUE TO
YOU.
 YOU KNOW, IT MAY APPEAR THAT
WAY TO KELLEY, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I NECESSARILY SEE IT THAT
WAY.
 Jeff: KIMMI, DO YOU BELIEVE
IT'S FOUR VERSUS TWO AND IT'S
BETWEEN WENTWORTH AND KEITH
TONIGHT?
 I BELIEVE THAT.
 WELL, THAT CLEARED THAT UP.
 Jeff: SO THEN KEITH, WHAT
DO YOU DO IF THAT'S THE CASE AND
IT'S YOU OR WENTWORTH?
 I WON'T SAY LIE, CHEAT AND
STEAL, BUT LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL,
ANYTHING TO GET YOU ONE MORE
STEP.
 Jeff: JEREMY, WHERE ARE WE
AT WITH IDOL CHATTER?
 THERE'S A LOT OF IDOL CHATTER
GOING AROUND.
 Jeff: SPENCER, IS PART OF
THE DECISION IN WHO YOU WOULD
VOTE OUT IS IF SOMEBODY DOES
HAVE AN IDOL, LET'S TRY TO GET
RID OF IT.
 THE FOUR PEOPLE WHO VOTED
TOGETHER LAST TRIBAL MADE A PLAN
TO SPLIT THE VOTES TONIGHT.
AFTER THE LAST 24 HOURS, TASHA,
JEREMY AND I AREN'T GOOD WITH
SPLITTING THE VOTE ANYMORE.
 Jeff: YOU'RE LEAVING KIMMI
OUT OF THIS ON PURPOSE.
 TASHA, JEREMY ANDRY VOTING
THREE STRONG ON ONE PERSON, AND
IT WILL BE JUMP ON BOARD OR DRAW
A ROCK AND MAYBE GO HOME.
 Jeff: OKAY.
SO KIMMI, SPENCER DROPS THIS
BOMB, AND HE SPECIFICALLY
EXCLUDES YOU.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
[GROANING]
 I TALKED TO SOMEBODY OUTSIDE
THE ALLIANCE AND THEN THE PAIR
NOWBACK AN I'M BEING THREATENED
ALMOST THAT I HAVE TO VOTE AWAY
AND I CAN'T EVEN ABSORB.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU LOOK
VERY CONFUSEDFUL.
 I'M VERY CONFUSED.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
 SPENCE CAN RATTLE ALL HE
WANTS.
HE'S SAFE TONIGHT.
HE CALLED US OUT.
I THINK WE KNOW THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.
 Jeff: ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THERE IS ABOUT TO BE A SHOWDOWN
RIGHT NOW?
 I WOULD SAY.
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE EXACTLY
RIGHT.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, WHAT'S
HAPPENING?
 I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD IS GOING
TO SPIN OFF.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME AND SAYING,
YOU'RE FINE.
I TRUSTED SPENCER LAST VOTE AND
I WASN'T FINE.
 THAT'S VERY FAIR, BUT ANYONE
IS FINE IF THEY JUMP ON BOARD
WITH WITH US BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO ROCK IF THAT'S WHAT IT COMES
TO.
 LET'S GO TO ROCK.
 WOW.
 Jeff: JEREMY, ISN'T THIS
THE INVOICE FOR VOTING BLOCS AND
NO ALLIANCES?
 I DON'T THINK THIS IS ALL
NEEDED.
THESE VOTING BLOCS COULD STOP
AND WE COULD STOP MAKING A PATH
TO THE FINAL THREE.
GEEZ.
 Jeff: KIMMI, YOU'RE OUT ON
AN ISLAND RIGHT NOW.
WHAT'S YOUR MOVE?
 I MEAN, I'M NOT IN THE TOP
THREE.
APPARENTLY I'M A PAWN.
 NO ONE SAID YOU'RE NOT IN THE
TOP THREE.
NO ONE CALLED YOU A PAWN.
 AND IF YOU VOTE THE WAY YOU
SAID, YOU'RE FINE.
 YOU'LL BE NUMBER FOUR.
 KIMMI, YOU WILL NOT BE NUMBER
FOUR.
 RELAX.
 Jeff: KEITH, YOU'RE SAYING,
LET'S VOTE.
 LET'S VOTE.
 Jeff: DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING?
 YES.
 Jeff: JEREMY?
 YES.
 WENTWORTH?
 YES.
 SPENCER?
 YES.
 KIMMI?
 YES.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SPENCER, YOU'RE UP.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
TONIGHT, BUT I DON'T TRUST
ANYBODY HERE, SO... I DON'T KNOW
IF SPENCER IS LYING TO ME OR
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT I'M GOING
TO HAVE THE PLAY IT FOR MYSELF
JUST IN CASE.
 Jeff: OKAY.
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR WENTWORTH
WILL NOT COUNT.
 HOLD ON, JEFFREY.
I HAVE A WAR E.
 Jeff: THIS IS ALSO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JEREMY WILL
NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
 GET OUT OF HERE.
 Jeff: FIRST VOTE WENTWORTH.
DOES NOT COUNT.
JEREMY.
DOES NOT COUNT.
KELLEY WENTWORTH, DOES NOT
COUNT.
JEREMY.
DOES NOT COUNT.
KELLEY WENTWORTH.
DOES NOT COUNT.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
JEREMY.
WILL NOT COUNT.
ALL RIGHT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 31
SEASONS.
WE HAVE IN VOTES CAST FOR
ANYBODY AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WOW.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 31
SEASONS, WE HAVE NO VOTES FOR
ANYBODY AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN: WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE.
SPENCER IS STILL IMMUNE.
WENTWORTH AND JEREMY BOTH PLAYED
IDOLS.
THEY ARE SAFE, AS WELL.
YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR KIMMI,
TASHA OR KEITH, AND EVERYBODY
VOTES BECAUSE THIS IS
UNPRECEDENTED I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU A MINUTE TO TALK BEFORE WE
REVOTE.
 WHO VOTED FOR ME?
WHO VOTED FOR ME?
YOU VOTE FOR ME?
 I DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU.
 YOU KNOW WHO VOTE FOR YOU,
KEITH, WENTWORTH AND KIMMI.
YOU MADE PLAN TO VOTE OUT
JEREMY.
YOU THREE MADE A PLAN TO VOTE
OUT JEREMY.
 OKAY.
BOOM.
 ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU PLAY AN
IDOL AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS.
 ARE YOU GUYS GOOD?
 I'M GOOD.
 LET'S DO IT.
 KIMMI, YOU'RE UP.
 KIMMI, KIMMI, KIMMI.
 SO DISAPPOINTED.
SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE TASHA.
KIMMI.
TASHA.
TWO VOTES TASHA.
KIMMI.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
TWO VOTES TASHA, TWO VOTES
KIMMI.
TASHA.
THAT'S THREE VOTES TASHA.
TWO VOTES KIMMI.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
KIMMI.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.
SO PER THE RULES, BECAUSE THIS
IS A NEW VOTE, YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO A REVOTE IN CASE SOMEBODY
WANTS TO CHANGE THEIR VOTE.
THE ONLY REASON WE WILL NOT
REVOTE IS IF SPENCER, WENTWORTH,
JEREMY AND KEITH TELL ME YOU
GUYS ARE GOOD WITH YOUR VOTES
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE
THEM.
 I'M GOOD WITH MY VOTE.
 I'M NOT CHANGING MY VOTE.
 I'M GOOD WITH MINE.
 LET'S DO IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THAT MEANS WE'RE DEADLOCKED.
SPENCER, WENTWORTH, JEREMY AND
KEITH NOW GET TO HAVE A
DISCUSSION, AND IF THE FOUR OF
YOU CAN COME UP WITH A UNANIMOUS
DECISION TO GET RID OF EITHER
TASHA OR KIMMI, THAT PERSON IS
OUT.
IF YOU CAN'T COME TO A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, ALL FOUR OF YOU
AGREEING, THEN KIMMI AND TASHA
BECOME SAFE AND THEY JOIN
WENTWORTH, SPENCER AND JEREMY AS
ALL BEING IMMUNE.
THAT WOULD MEAN KEITH, BY
DEFAULT, YOU WOULD GO HOME.
 THIS IS CRAZY.
VERY BIG DISCUSSION TO BE HAD
RIGHT NOW.
WOULD YOU RATHER KEITH GO HOME
OR KIMMI?
 TASHA ISN'T GOING HOME.
 WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO YOU OR
KIMMI GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 I WOULD LIKE TO STAY.
I WANT TO BE HERE.
 I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.
 I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER, BUT,
OF COURSE, KEITH, I WANT TO
STAY.
 I KNOW YOU DO.
 I KNOW YOU WANT TO STAY, BUT
I WOULD LIKE... I HAVEN'T BEEN
HERE IN A LONG TIME.
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY.
 I TELL YOU WHAT, SHE'S A
MAMA.
 YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE UP YOUR
SPOT?
 YEAH, SHE'S A SINGLE MAMA,
TWO YOUNG BABIES, SEND ME TO THE
HOUSE.
 I AM GOOD.
IF IT'S NOT TONIGHT, IT'S
TOMORROW AND THE NEXT.
 Jeff: SO KEITH, YOU ARE
VOLUNTARILY...
 HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP LIKE
THAT.
 I'M NOT GIVING UP.
I DON'T WANT KIMMI TO GO TO THE
HOUSE EITHER.
 Jeff: SO LET ME CLEAR THIS
UP SO I KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT.
SPENCER AND JEREMY, YOU ARE BOTH
SAYING IT'S KIMMI FOR US, THAT'S
THE ONLY THING WE'RE GOING TO
DO.
 CORRECT.
 Jeff: SO THE QUESTION IS
ARE WENTWORTH AND KEITH GOING TO
JOIN YOU AGAINST KIMMI OR IT IS
KEITH BY DEFAULT.
SO WHEN -- WENTWORTH, WHAT IS
YOUR VOICE?
 DO YOU WANT TO STAY?
 IT'S LIKE STAY OR GO HOME
TOMORROW.
 WE DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU NEED TO STAY.
 YEAH, SURE, I'LL STAY.
 ALL RIGHT.
THEN I WANT KEITH TO STAY.
 Jeff: SO YOU ARE SAYING
KIMMI.
I'LL VOTE KIMMI.
 SPENCER, WHO DO YOU SAY?
 KIMMI.
 KIMMI.
 KEITH?
KIMMI.
 KIMMI, AFTER 36 DAYS, YOU
BECOME THE 14th PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
 I TRIED.
 Jeff: KIMMI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A
GOOD GAME.
 ALL RIGHT, GIRL.
 LOVE YOU GIRL.
I'M SORRY.
 Jeff: WOW.
 WOW.
 Jeff: GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 YOU GIVE IT YOUR ALL.
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW,
AND I NEVER GAVE UP.
SO I MEAN I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.
WOW.
AFTER 15 YEARS TO GET THIS
SECOND CHANCE, I THINK I HUNG IN
THERE PRETTY WELL.
 WELL, THAT WAS A SNOOZER OF A
TRIBAL.
PRETTY BORING.
 HOW WILD WAS THAT?
 YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT THAT
BABY IN THE RECORD BOOK.
 THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE,
NO VALID VOTES FOR ANYONE.
 I'VE NEVER SEEN A TRIBAL LIKE
THAT, MUCH LESS BE PART OF ONE.
AFTER ALL'S SAID AND DONE AND
THE TIES AND VOTES AND UNANIMOUS
STUFF, KIMMI GOES TO THE HOUSE,
BUT I WAS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
GO FIGURE THAT OUT.
IT WAS CRAZY.
THAT WAS WILD.
 MIND BLOWING.
I LOST TRACK.
FIVE PEOPLE NOW AND THREE OF
THEM ARE PRETTY SOLID.
LEAVES ME AND KELLEY ON THE
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.
 WENTWORTH, WHERE ARE YOU
FINDING THESE IDOLS?
 SHE'S GOOD, ISN'T SHE?
WE BETTER GO OUT AND START
LOOKING RIGHT NOW.
GIVE ME A FLASHLIGHT.
 I SURVIVED ANOTHER TRIBAL BY
PLAYING AN IDOL, WHICH IS
FANTASTIC, BUT THE TRIBAL ITSELF
DIDN'T GO THE WAY I WANTED IT TO
GO.
HERE I AM WITH FOUR OTHER
PEOPLE, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE
PERSON THAT I TRUST, SO LIKE
WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?
 YOU ALL RIGHT, WENTWORTH?
 I'M FINE.
I'M FANTASTIC.
I'M GOOD.
THIS IS LIKE THE WORST FEELING
BEING SO CLOSE TO THE END AND
YET IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ONE OF THE CRAZIEST TRIBAL
COUNCILS EVER, AND I KNOW THERE
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME
RIGHT NOW AND IN THE AUDIENCE,
EVEN SUPER FANS SAYING, WAIT A
MINUTE, WHAT HAPPENED?
SO I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE
RECAP HERE, BECAUSE ON THE
NIGHT, ALL OF US WERE CONFUSED
GOING, WAIT A SEC, HUH?
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN REVOTING?
SO WE COME TO TRIBAL.
SPENCER HAS IMMUNITY.
HE'S SAFE.
WE VOTE.
I ASK, DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN
IDOL?
WENTWORTH, YES.
JEREMY, YES.
SO THEY'RE ALL SAFE.
WE DID OUR HISTORIC THING WHERE
NO VALID VOTES CAST.
THAT BLEW EVERYBODY'S MIND.
THEN WE STILL HAVE TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT.
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE AND START
OVER.
NOW YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR KIMMI,
TASHA AND KEITH.
WE COME BACK.
WE HAVE ANOTHER TIE.
THESE TWO HAVE VOTES.
I ASK, ANYBODY WANT THE CHANGE
THEIR VOTES.
NO, WE'RE DEADLOCKED.
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS
INTERESTING BECAUSE PER THE
RULES OF "SURVIVOR," AND WE HAVE
RULES...
[LAUGHTER]
...IF THERE IS A DEADLOCKED
VOTE, NOBODY SWITCH, THEN ALL OF
THE OTHER PLAYERS WHO DON'T HAVE
VOTES, IN THIS CASE SPENCER,
WENTWORTH, JEREMY AND KEITH, GET
TO HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION, AND
THIS IS ABOUT PERSUADING.
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH ONE
PERSON TO GET RID OF.
YOU HAVE TO GET THOSE OTHER GUYS
ON YOUR SIDE.
IF YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH A
DECISION, IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A
DECISION, THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE.
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE ALWAYS
WANT THE GAME TO BE DICTATED BY
THE PLAYERS.
IT'S UP TO YOU.
PICK TASHA OR PICK KIMMI, BUT IF
YOU DON'T PICK EITHER, THEY
BECOME SAFE, A 180, AND
EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WAS SAFE HAS
TO DRAW ROCKS, THE ODD ROCK GOES
HOME.
BUT WHERE IT GOT REALLY
COMPLICATED IS HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO DRAW, SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO
DRAW, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DRAW.
THAT LEAVES POOR OLD KEITH, WHO
DIDN'T HAVE ANY VOTES, HAVING TO
DRAW THE ONE ROCK, AND YOU SAW
IT PLAY OUT.
THAT'S REASON NUMBER 322 WHY
"SURVIVOR" IS SO TOUGH TO WIN.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
THE SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR:
SECOND CHANCE" AND WE ARE JUST
GETTING STARTED.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
SPENCER, GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.
THANK YOU.
 OH, BOY.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE THROUGH A GIANT
OBSTACLE COURSE.
YOU'RE GOING TO RACE THROUGH A
SERIES OF FIXED STATIONS
COLLECTING SIX BAGS OF PUZZLE
PIECES ALONG THE WAY.
YOU'LL THEN USE THOSE PIECES TO
SOLVE A PUZZLE.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE NINTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
BIG STAKES.
HERE WE GO.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THERE ARE SIX STATIONS.
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE OF YOU.
SO YOU SHOULDN'T GET CAUGHT
BEHIND ANYBODY.
LOTS OF PLACES TO GO.
FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNTIE A BAG.
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET ACROSS THAT
OBSTACLE.
WENTWORTH TAKES ON ONE OF THE
TOUGHEST ONES FIRST.
IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME, BUT
YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.
JEREMY HAS HIS FIRST BAG.
HE'S ACROSS.
HE'S HEADING OVER.
HERE COMES KEITH.
AND SPENCER RIGHT BEHIND.
KEITH'S BACK WITH HIS FIRST BAG.
TASHA GETS ACROSS WITH HER FIRST
BAG.
HERE COMES SPENCER WITH HIS
FIRST BAG.
AND A BIG HIT.
SPENCER HAS TAKEN SOME FALLS IN
THIS GAME.
WENTWORTH, SHE'S ACROSS, AND
THAT WILL COME IN HANDY LATER
WHEN SHE CAN MAKE UP A LOT OF
TIME.
QUESTION IS WILL IT PAY OFF?
SPENCER HAS HIS SECOND BAG.
HE'S HEADING BACK.
HERE'S TASHA WITH HER SECOND.
JEREMY BACK WITH HIS SECOND.
KEITH HAS HIS SECOND.
SPENCER HAS HIS SECOND.
WENTWORTH HAS HER SECOND.
JEREMY BACK WITH HIS THIRD BAG.
IT IS JEREMY WITH THREE,
EVERYBODY ELSE WITH TWO.
THERE'S KEITH.
KEITH HAS THREE.
WE ARE VERY CLOSE RIGHT NOW.
TASHA BACK WITH HER THIRD.
SPENCER BACK WITH HIS THIRD.
HERE COMES JEREMY WITH HIS
FOURTH.
IT IS JEREMY IN THE LEAD.
WENTWORTH NOW HAS HER THIRD.
KEITH NOW COMING BACK WITH HIS
FOURTH.
TASHA AND WENTWORTH AT THE SAME
STATION.
WENTWORTH GETS OUT FIRST.
WENTWORTH NOW WITH FOUR.
HERE COMES JEREMY WITH HIS
FIFTH.
HE'S GOT ONE LEFT.
CAN HE KEEP THE LEAD?
TASHA BACK WITH HER FOURTH.
EVERYBODY FIGHTING HARD.
THERE'S KEITH WITH NUMBER FIVE.
HE'S GOT ONE LEFT.
WENTWORTH BACK WITH HER FIFTH
BAG.
TASHA COMING BACK WITH HER FIFTH
BAG.
SPENCER STILL STUCK AT THREE,
TRYING TO GET BACK WITH HIS
FOURTH, WAY BEHIND NOW.
WENTWORTH NOW COMING BACK WITH
HER SIXTH AND FINAL BAG.
SPENCER BACK WITH HIS FOURTH.
WENTWORTH WENT FOR THE TOUGHEST
ONE FIRST AND IT PAID OFF.
WENTWORTH HAS ALL SIX.
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
SPENCER FALLING OUT OF THIS.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP
SOME TIME QUICKLY.
HERE COMES JEREMY WITH HIS SIXTH
BAG.
KEITH RIGHT ON HIS TAIL WITH HIS
SIXTH BAG.
TASHA RIGHT BEHIND WITH HER
SIXTH BAG.
HERE COMES SPENCER WITH HIS
FIFTH.
HE HAS GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
HE IS VERY FAR BEHIND.
IT IS WENTWORTH, KEITH AND
JEREMY WORKING ON THEIR PUZZLES.
SPENCER NOW IS GOING TO PASS
TASHA.
HE SAVED THE EASIEST FOR LAST.
SPENCER BACK WITH HIS SIXTH AND
FINAL BAG.
HE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
TASHA HAS HER SIXTH BAG.
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.
EVERYBODY IS WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLES NOW.
THIS IS IT, ONE OF THE CRAZIEST
AND MOST UNPREDICTABLE SEASONS
OF "SURVIVOR."
YOU NEED TO WIN TO STAY IN IT.
WENTWORTH HAS HER FIRST PIECE.
IF SHE'S RIGHT, SHE'S OFF TO A
GOOD START BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET
ONE PIECE, THINGS START TO LOCK
IN.
JEREMY HAS A FIRST PIECE.
KEITH HAS HIS FIRST PIECE.
WENTWORTH HAS HER SECOND PIECE
NOW.
JEREMY WITH WITH HIS SECOND
PIECE.
JUST LIKE THAT KEITH WITH TWO.
SPENCER STILL LOOKING FOR THAT
FIRST PIECE.
WENTWORTH WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
WENTWORTH IN THE LEAD WITH THREE
PIECES.
KEITH PLACING HIS THIRD.
WENTWORTH PLACES A FOURTH PIECE.
SHE'S HALF-WAY THERE.
LOOK AT THAT.
KEITH WITH FOUR PIECES.
KEITH HALF-WAY THERE.
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THIS,
WENTWORTH AND KEITH BOTH WITH
FOUR PIECES.
SPENCER WITH NOTHING.
WENTWORTH PLACES A FIFTH PIECE.
WENTWORTH TRYING TO GET A SIXTH
PIECE IN.
WILL IT FIT?
IS SHE RIGHT?
SHE'S GOT IT.
WENTWORTH DOWN TO TWO PIECES
LEFT.
KEITH PLACES HIS FIFTH PIECE.
IT IS WENTWORTH AND KEITH RIGHT
NOW FOR THE WIN.
WENTWORTH HAS HER SEVENTH.
WENTWORTH WITH HER EIGHTH.
CAN SHE GET IT?
IS IT RIGHT?
WENTWORTH WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT IN
THE FINAL FOUR!
 THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOSH.
 Jeff: THAT IS WHY YOU NEVER
GIVE UP IN THIS GAME.
WENTWORTH, COME ON OVER.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
I NEEDED THIS ONE.
 Jeff: ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.
SOUNDS LIKE IT CAME AT THE
PERFECT TIME.
 YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WENTWORTH WILL BE A
MEMBER OF THE FINAL FOUR.
NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.
AS FOR THE FOUR OF YOU, 37 DAYS
AND YET FOR ONE OF YOU, YOUR
DREAM OF WINNING "SURVIVOR:
SECOND CHANCE" WILL FALL TWO
DAYS SHORT.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME, NINTH MEMBER OF THE
JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 THE ONE PERSON I DON'T NEED
TO WIN WINS IT.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A COFFIN AND
I GOT ABOUT THREE NAILS LEFT
UNTIL THEY PUT ME SIX FEET DOWN.
IT ABOUT IT SHUT YET.
WE'LL GO DOWN SWINGING.
WE'LL FIND OUT .
STAY TUNED.
 THAT WAS HARD PUZZLE.
 YEAH, IT WAS.
 A PUZZLE MASTER LIKE SPENCER.
 WENTWORTH WAS ABLE TO WIN,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TASHA AND
JEREMY AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
AVOID.
 OKAY.
 KEITH IS NOW VERY CLEARLY A
TARGET, BUT THERE'S EXACTLY ONE
THING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT, AND
THAT IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THE THREE OF US MUST STAY STRONG
NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO.
 WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?
I'M SITTING HERE BALLS TO THE
WALL.
 I DO NOT HAVE AN IDOL.
WE CAN TRY AND MAKE A FAKE ONE,
BECAUSE IF THEY EVEN THINK YOU
HAVE AN IDOL, THOSE TWO DON'T
WANT TO GO HOME.
I WANT SPENCER OR JEREMY GONE.
 I'M SAFE TONIGHT, BUT I HAVE
TO LOOK OUT FOR MY ONE ALLY IN
THIS GAME.
SO BASED ON THE FACT THAT ALL
THE IDOLS LOOK DIFFERENT THIS
SEASON, JUST TAKE A LITTLE
MEDALLION FROM A TREE MAIL, AND
I HAVE SOME MATERIALS THAT I
HAVE BEEN CHECKING OVER THE PAST
FEW WEEKS, WRAPPED IT UP WITH A
LITTLE NOTE FROM MY LAST IDOL,
THERE YOU GO.
LOOKS LIKE KEITH FOUND AN IDOL.
I DEFINITELY WANT SPENCER OR
JEREMY GONE.
AND I KNOW THAT THE PARANOIA IS
REAL.
EVEN IF THOSE THREE ARE TIGHT,
IF ANY OF THEM THINK THEY'RE
GOING HOME, IT'S GOING TO CREATE
PARANOIA IN THEIR MIND, AND
SOMETHING CRAZY COULD HAPPEN.
 YOU FEELING GOOD?
WHAT'S UP?
 I'M FEELING FUNNY.
 YOU FEELING FUNNY ABOUT MAYBE
AN IDOL?

 IT'S CRUNCH TIME.
IT'S DESPERATE MEASURES RIGHT
NOW.
KELLEY THE IDOL MAKER UP THERE,
WE'LL JUST SEE WHAT SHE DID.
HEY, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
I LIKE THAT, KEL.
I HAVE TO GO BACK THE CAMP
SPORTING THIS AND LET THEM SEE
IT, MAKE THEM THINK I HAVE ONE,
JUST TO PUT DOUBT IN THEIR MIND,
AND THAT'S ALL IT TAKES IS JUST
ONE OF THEM TO FLIP, SCARE THEM
INTO DOING SOMETHING STUPID.
 WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO GO AFTER?
 IF ONE OF THEM HAS AN IDOL,
WHAT CAN WE DO?
 I THINK THERE WAS A HUGE
POSSIBILITY THAT KEITH OR KELLEY
ARE GOING TO PULL OUT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL TONIGHT.
I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
IT'S EITHER ME OR SPENCER
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT VOTES ON.
I'M WORRIED.
POINT BLANK.
IF KEITH HAS AN IDOL, ONE OF US
ARE GOING HOME.
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO
AFTER ME.
I DON'T WANT THE TAKE A CHANCE
ON IT.
 TASHA WAS ASLEEP, AND JEREMY
KIND OF COME TO ME AND SAID,
VOTE SPENCE.
SPENCER'S A GOOD PLAYER.
MAKES SENSE TO SEND HIM TO THE
HOUSE?
MAYBE JEREMY'S THING ABOUT
BRINGING ME IN, MAYBE ME, JEREMY
AND KELLEY.
JEREMY KIND OF LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID SPENCE.
 HUH.
I FEEL LIKE IF SPENCER'S GONE WE
HAVE A BETTER SHOT.
 OH, I KNOW.
 WELL, SEE HOW IT GOES AT
TRIBAL, BUT I'M TELLING YOU TO
KEEP THE IDOL IN VIEW.
 IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING
SOUTH, I'LL SAY SOMETHING, BUT
I'LL HAVE IT IN MY BAG.
 WOULD JEREMY LIE TO ME?
HECK, MAYBE AT TRIBAL I'LL PULL
IT OUT AND SAY, THERE'S AN IDOL,
KEITH AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE
TONIGHT.
YOU BETTER MAKE SOME DIFFERENT
PLANS.
WHEN YOU GOT OPTION, IT'S A GOOD
THING.
GOD DANG, THE LAST NAIL AIN'T IN
THE COFFIN.
[LAUGHING]
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH,
CIERA, FISHBACH, JOE, ABI AND
KIMMI VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO TASHA, AFTER THE CRAZY LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT SEEMED THAT
WHEN THE DUST SETTLED IT WAS
YOU, SPENCER AND JEREMY VERSUS
WENTWORTH AND KEITH.
WAS THAT STILL THE SAME STORY
GOING INTO THE CHALLENGE?
 GOING INTO THE CHALLENGE,
YES, JEFF, THAT WAS THE SAME
STORY.
 Jeff: SO WENTWORTH YOU
CLEARLY FELT YOUR BACK UP
AGAINST THE WALL?
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
I HAD TO WIN IMMUNITY OR I WOULD
PROBABLY BE THE ONE GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: SO KEITH, UNLESS
SOMETHING'S CHANGED, DOES THAT
MEAN IT'S YOU?
 UNLESS THINGS CHANGE, THAT'S
RIGHT, PRETTY CUT AND DRY.
 Jeff: SPENCER, RING TRUE TO
YOU?
 IT IS FAIRLY CUT AND DRY, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, IN A SEASON
WITH BLIND SIDE AFTER BLIND SIDE
AFTER BLIND SIDE, MAYBE A
STRAIGHTFORWARD VOTE AND PEOPLE
ACTUALLY STICKING TOGETHER
BECOMES THE NEW BIG MOVE.
 Jeff: JEREMY, FINAL FIVE,
LAST TIME YOU CAN USE AN IDOL,
IS THERE TALK THAT SOMEBODY IN
THIS GROUP OF FIVE MIGHT INDEED
HAVE AN IDOL?
 YES, THERE'S TALK ABOUT THAT,
YES.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHAT WOULD
THAT DO TO THE GAME IN
 THAT WOULD CHANGE THE GAME
FOR ME.
IF EITHER KEITH OR WENTWORTH HAS
AN IDOL, THOSE TWO WILL ACTUALLY
DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU READY
TO VOTE?
 I GUESS SO, IT FEELS LIKE MY
VOTE DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY KEITH'S GOING HOME
TONIGHT, BUT, SURE, LET'S VOTE.
 Jeff: TASH, YEAH IT WOULD
NOT BE FIRST TIME THAT WENTWORTH
HAS SAID, MY VOTE DOESN'T
MATTER, I HAVE NO PLAY, AND
THEN, BOOM.
 YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE IDOL
WHISPERER, SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS, JEFF.
 Jeff: SO KEITH, WHAT DO YOU
DO THIS AFTERNOON?
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO 37 DAYS AND
SAY, ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT'S ALL
RIGHT, THANKS, GUYS.
 YEAH.
THERE ARE SOME TRICKS AROUND TO
BE PLAYED.
 Jeff: WOW.
TASHA?
 I FELT LIKE MAYBE THAT WAS
JUST A LITTLE THREAT, THAT THERE
ARE SOME TRICKS TO COME, AND
IT'S STILL NOT OVER.
THE THEME THIS SEASON IS EXPECT
THE UNEXPECTED.
SO TONIGHT I'M EXPECTING THE
UNEXPECTED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
KEITH, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, TONIGHT IS THE LAST TIME
YOU CAN PLAY IT.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED
OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE SPENCER.
KEITH.
ONE VOTE SPENCER, ONE VOTE
KEITH.
SPENCER.
TWO VOTES SPENCER.
ONE VOTE KEITH.
KEITH.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES SPENCER, TWO VOTES
KEITH.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
15th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
KEITH, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
KEITH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
HANG IN THERE.
 SEE YOU, KEITH NALE.
 GOLLY.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
FOUR.
TOMORROW YOU WILL COMPETE IN
YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
WIN THAT AND YOU EARN YOURSELF A
SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 YOU TRY TO PLAY WITH A LITTLE
INTEGRITY.
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T PLAY THAT
CHEESY IDOL THERE, YOU KNOW.
BUT ANYWAY, CRAZY RIDE.
I WANT THE THANK ALL OF AMERICA
FOR GIVING ME THIS GREAT
ADVENTURE.
I TRIED TO BRING IT HOME FOR THE
OLD GUYS, JUST A COUPLE DAYS
SHY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
FINAL FOUR.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 YEAH.
 YEP.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WENTWORTH, GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.
 ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONE HAND
WILL BE TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK.
ON MY GO YOU'LL DROP A BALL DOWN
A CHUTE.
IT WILL SPIRAL TO THE BOTTOM
WHERE YOU MUST CATCH IT AND PUT
IT BACK IN.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS WE WILL ADD
ANOTHER BALL.
, THAT WILL MAKE IT MORE
DIFFICULT.
IF AT ANY POINT A BALL DROPS,
YOU'RE OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY AND REACHES THE HOLY
GRAIL, A SPOT AT THE FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE YOU WILL
GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE
TO THE JURY ABOUT WHY YOU
DESERVE THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION THAT
GOES WITH IT.
LET'S DO IT.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR A GUARANTEED SPOT AT THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL, EVERYBODY
GRAB YOUR FIRST BALL.
DEEP BREATH AND DROP.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
THIS IS IT.
THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
COULD BE WORTH $1 MILLION.
THIS WILL GET YOU WARMED UP.
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS
TO THE GROUND, YOU'RE OUT.
THE KEY TO THIS CHALLENGE IS THE
GATE.
IT WILL SEND ONE BALL TO THE
LEFT.
THE NEXT BALL TO THE RIGHT.
SO YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT
RHYTHM, HOW IS THIS GOING TO GO
WHEN I GET TWO, THREE, FOUR
BALLS MOVING.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO ADD A
SECOND BALL.
SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT SPACING.
SPENCER DROPS.
WENTWORTH DROPS.
JEREMY DROPS.
TASHA DROPS.
EVERYBODY NOW WITH TWO BALLS.
NOW YOU HAVE TO GO LEFT AND
RIGHT.
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE HAND TO DO
IT WITH.
DON'T GET MESMERIZED BY THE
HYPNOTIC SOUND OF THIS
CHALLENGE.
IT WILL LURE YOU INTO A
MEDITATION THAT COULD COST YOU
$1 MILLION.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO ADD A THIRD BALL.
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS STARTING
NOW.
START LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY, AND WHEN YOU SEE
IT, DROP IT.
DO NOT LOSE YOUR FOCUS.
EVERYBODY HAS THREE BALLS GOING.
WE HAVE REACHED THE NEXT STAGE
OF THIS CHALLENGE.
WITH EACH ADDITIONAL BALL, THAT
PACE PICKS UP.
KEEP CONCENTRATING.
FOLLOW THOSE BALLS, WATCH THEM.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE ALERT THAN
YOU WERE BEFORE.
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY GOOD IN
THIS CHALLENGE.
IN A MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO ADD A
FOURTH BALL.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TIMING.
SO WHERE YOU PUT THIS BALL IS
CRITICAL.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO ADD A
FOURTH BALL.
USE THAT TIME AS YOU WANT.
SPENCER DROPS RIGHT AWAY.
SPENCER WITH A NICE SAVE.
JEREMY DROPS.
TASHA DROPS.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: KELLEY WENTWORTH IS
OUT.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH'S
FRUSTRATION.
IT COULD BE A $1 MILLION LOSS.
 OH, GOD.
 Jeff: IT IS SPENCER, JEREMY
AND TASHA NOW, FOUR BALLS
SPINNING.
THIS IS A VERY FAST PACE RIGHT
NOW.
DO NOT LOSE YOUR FOCUS.
KEEP FOCUSING.
KEEP IT UP.
KEEP IT UP, KEEP IT UP.
TASHA DROPS.
SHE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.
IT IS SPENCER AND JEREMY IN THIS
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
CHALLENGE.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU EACH HAVE 30 SECONDS TO
PLACE A FIFTH BALL.
THE MINUTE YOU PLACE IT, IT'S
IN.
SPENCER HAS HIS FIFTH BALL IN.
JEREMY HAS HIS FIFTH BALL IN.
THIS IS IT.
WE'RE NOW INTO THE DEEPEST PART
OF THIS CHALLENGE, FIVE BALLS
SPINNING, DROPPING, LEFT AND
RIGHT, VERY FAST PACE.
SPENCER IS OUT.
JEREMY WHEN HE NEEDS IT MOST
WINS HIS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT AT
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
JEREMY, THIS IS THE MOST EMOTION
I'VE SEEN IN ANY OF THE DAYS
YOU'VE PLAYED "SURVIVOR."
 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, JEFF.
I CAN'T EVEN EXPRESS IT.
LIKE I JUST FEEL SO MUCH
EMOTION, LIKE I FEEL LIKE I'VE
BEEN THROUGH THIS ALREADY.
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.
JEFF, THIS IS ALL ABOUT VAL, YOU
KNOW.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT JORDAN.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT CAMERON.
 Jeff: THE FAMILY.
 THAT'S IT.
 Jeremy: WENTWORTH, THE TWO
DIFFERENT WORLDS RIGHT NOW
BETWEEN YOU AND JEREMY.
HIS EMOTION HAS SAID, I'VE DONE
IT.
YOUR EMOTION SAYS, I MIGHT HAVE
JUST FALLEN A LITTLE SHORT.
 I JUST KNEW I HAD TO WIN
TODAY BECAUSE THESE THREE ARE
CLEARLY VERY TIGHT, SO I'M JUST
MAD AT MYSELF.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ON ME TO WIN
AND I DIDN'T.
THAT'S IT.
 Jeremy: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
JEREMY IS SAFE.
SOMEBODY ELSE GOING HOME WILL
BECOME THE FINAL MEMBER OF OUR
JURY AND WILL NOT HAVE SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.
JEREMY, I DON'T WANT THE
INTERRUPT THE LOVE.
LET ME HAVE THE HONOR.
YOU ACCOMPLISHED YOUR GOAL, AS
FAR AS YOU CAN GET, THIS FINAL
TRIBAL.
BIG DECISION TONIGHT IS WHO WILL
BE SITTING NEXT TO YOU THALT
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING
AFTERNOON.
HOPE YOU GUYS ARE ALL PROUD OF
YOUR EFFORT.
IT WILL BE A TOUGH TRIBAL.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 THIS IS FOR VAL.
THIS IS FOR JORDAN.
THIS IS FOR CAMERON.
THIS IS FOR MY SON THAT'S NOT
EVEN HERE YET.
LIKE THIS IS FOR THEM ALL.
NOW THE QUESTION IS WHO I'M
GOING TO THE END WITH BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT SECOND.
I DON'T WANT THIRD.
LIKE I NEED TO WIN THIS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO JEREMY HAS MADE IT TO THE
END.
HE HAS ONE BIG DECISION LEFT,
WHO TO TAKE WITH HIM, AND THIS
IS WHERE PLAYERS HAVE BLOWN IT
IN THE PAST.
REMEMBER WHEN WOO CHOSE TONY?
NEXT TIME I SEE YOULY HAVE THE
VOTES.
IT'S THE FINALE, "SURVIVOR:
SECOND CHANCE."
 CONGRATS, BIG GUY.
FEEL GOOD?
 FEELS GOOD, MAN, FEELS GOOD.
 I FEEL LIKE I WANT THE LAUGH,
I WANT TO CRY, I WANT TO YELL.
I JUST WANT TO EXPLODE BECAUSE
THE SEASON IS SO HARD, AND JUST
TO HAVE THIS SECURITY JUST FOR
TONIGHT, IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL
THING.
SORRY FOR GETTING ALL EMOTIONAL
ON YOU ALL.
 IT WAS DESERVED.
 I HAVE MY ALLIANCE.
I HAVE SPENCE AND I HAVE TASHA,
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THIS NECKLACE,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.
YOU'RE LIKE, I KNOW WE SAID WE
WERE GOING TO DO THIS, BUT NOW
IS THE TIME WHEN YOU FIGURE
WHITE HOUSE IS THE BEST PERSON
THAT I CAN SIT NEXT TO THAT I
CAN WIN $1 MILLION.
 BEEN GOOD, BEEN REAL.
THE ONLY PERSON SAFE IS JEREMY.
 ALTHOUGH JEREMY, SPENCER AND
I ARE IN A TIGHT ALLIANCE,
SPENCE AND I ARE BASICALLY AT
JEREMY'S MERCY IF HE DECIDES TO
GO WITH WENTWORTH AND DROP ONE
OF US, OUR GAME IS OVER TONIGHT.
I JUST HOPE THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT WE'VE BUILT OVER THE PAST
38 DAYS IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GET
ME THROUGH THIS VOTE AND INTO A
FINAL THREE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 YOU'RE LOCKED IN, RIGHT?
 I'M LOCKED IN.
I'M LOCKED IN.
 FINAL THREE.
 TO HAVE IT ALL COME DOWN TO
ONE VOTE WITH MY FATE OUT OF MY
HANDS, IN JEREMY'S HANDS, IT'S
HARD TO SWALLOW, BUT IN A WAY,
IT'S HOW I THINK MY SECOND
CHANCE COULD MAKE SENSE.
 YOU CAN'T MASTERMIND THIS
GAME.
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED, ONCE I
LOST CONTROL OF MY FATE, I LOST
THE GAME.
THIS IS A TEST OF WHETHER THE
RELATIONSHIPS I'VE BUILT ARE
STRONG ENOUGH THAT WITHOUT
CONTROL OF MY FATE TONIGHT I CAN
WAKE UP HERE TOMORROW AND HAVE A
SHOT TO FIGHT AND WIN THIS GAME.
 DO YOU KNOW WHICH OF US
YOU'RE VOTING?
 DOES IT MATTER?
 YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO
DO, IF YOU GO TO TRIBAL AND SAY
EVERYONE VOTES SPENCER, I'M NOT
GOING TO HOLD THAT AGAINST YOU.
 WHY IS THAT FUNNY?
 BECAUSE YOU ALL THREE ARE
REALLY CLOSE?
 IT'S NOT ABOUT CLOSENESS
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ABOUT WHO IS LIKELY TO WIN.
 YEAH.
 I THINK I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
CASE.
 SPENCER DEFINITELY KNOWS HE'S
A THREAT IN THIS GAME.
HE'S LIKE, ARE YOU WRITING MY
NAME DOWN?
I THINK I HAVE A GOOD SHOT OF
WINNING.
OH.
DO YOU?
OKAY.
INTERESTING.
 WELL, JUST KNOW THAT I'M
VOTING FOR YOU BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'D KICK MY ASS.
 I THINK RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST
THREAT FOR JEREMY IS SPENCER.
SO REALLY THE ONLY THING I CAN
DO IS TO TRY AND CONVINCE JEREMY
OF THAT AND PROVE THAT SPENCER
IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN ME.
TIME TO GO TO WORK.
THE THINGLY SAY ABOUT YOU IS
THAT I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE REALLY
RESPECT YOU.
THE THING ABOUT SPENCER IS THAT
HE SPEAKS REALLY WELL, AND
SPENCER HAS DONE A LOT OF
PLAYING BOTH SIDES AND LIKE
MAKING PEOPLE THINK.
I DON'T KNOW.
 I DON'T KNOW EITHER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO YET.
SPENCER AND WENTWORTH BOTH HAVE
GOOD RESUMES.
THE QUESTION IS WHO GIVES ME THE
BEST CHANCE TO WIN.
 I KNOW HE FEELS CONFIDENT HE
CAN WIN.
HE TOLD ME THAT.
 WOULD YOU DO FIRE?
 WOULD I DO FIRE?
OF COURSE I WOULD.
 I'M TRYING NOT TO LECH THE
NECKLACE GO TO MY HEAD, BUT WHAT
IF WE MADE SPENCER AND WENTWORTH
GO AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A TIE
AND MAKE FIRE?
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'M THINKING.
DON'T THINK THAT IT'S DONE.
 NEW YORK I KNOW.
 SPENCE CAME FROM THE BOTTOM,
WON A COUPLE IMMUNITIES.
HE'S A SMART PLAYER.
KELLEY'S WON TWO IMMUNITIES.
SHE'S PLAYED TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLSEN SHE'S AN UNDERDOG.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TONIGHT.
I'M GOING TO MAKE MY DECISION AT
TRIBAL WHETHER IT'S SPENCER AND
KELLEY.
IF I WANT TO STICK WITH MY
ALLIANCE, I CAN STICK WITH THEM.
IF NOT I CAN JUMP SHIP.
THIS IS A MILLION DOLLAR
DECISION.
IT'S HUGE.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH,
CIERA, FISHBACH, JOE, ABI,
KIMMI, AND KEITH, VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO LET'S GO BACK TO YOUR FINAL
CHALLENGE.
JEREMY, THE BIG PART OF THE
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE TO WIN IS
INDIVIDUAL NECKLACE, AND EVEN
THOUGH IT WAS DEVASTATION FOR
WENTWORTH, SPENCER AND TASHA, I
COULD SEE THEM LETTING YOU HAVE
THIS EUPHORIC MOMENT.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PENT-UP
EMOTION IN YOU, AND KNOWING THAT
I MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO 39,
LIKE I COULDN'T HELP IT.
IT WAS JUST... I COULDN'T EVEN
CONTROL IT.
 Jeff: SPENCER, THAT BALL
DROPPED, IT HITS THE WOOD.
WHAT'S THE FEELING?
 THE FEELING IS REALLY
DISHEARTENING.
MY HOPE IS THAT I'VE SET MYSELF
UP SO THAT I STILL HAVE A
POSSIBILITY OF STAYING IN THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, LAST
TRIBAL YOU WERE PRETTY CLEAR
ABOUT SAYING, LOOK, IF IT'S
KEITH THIS TIME, IT'S ME NEXT
TIME.
 OF COURSE BECAUSE THESE THREE
HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE FOR THE
LAST THREE VOTES.
I HAVE FELT LIKE I'M ON THE
OUTSIDE, HOWEVER, WE'RE AT THE
POINT IN THE GAME WHEN YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT THE FINAL THREE.
IT'S MORE THAN JUST WHO HAS
VOTED TOGETHER AND WHO HAS BEEN
IN AN ALLIANCE.
IT'S ABOUT WHO DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN BEAT AT THE END.
 Jeff: JEREMY, WHAT
WENTWORTH IS HINTING AT IS WHO
DO YOU WANT TO SIT NEXT TO?
 SPENCER AND TASHA AND MYSELF
HAVE BEEN REAL CLOSE, BUT
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR FUTURE
AND MY FAMILY'S FUTURE.
AND I GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR
ME, YOU KNOW?
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO HOME TONIGHT, SO
WHAT'S YOUR PITCH TO JEREMY?
 I JUST TALKED TO JEREMY, AND
I'M VOTING FOR SPENCER TONIGHT.
I THINK HE IS A BIG THREAT TO
WIN THE GAME IF HE'S IN THE
FINAL THREE.
HE'S VERY ARTICULATE.
HE KNOWS WHAT TO SAY AT TRIBAL.
AND I'M SURE HE ALREADY HAS HIS
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL SPEECH
PLANNED OUT.
 NOT UNTIL I'M THERE.
 HE'S WON QUITE A FEW
IMMUNITIES.
I THINK HE'S A BIG THREAT.
 THIS IS THE POT CALLING THE
KETTLE BLACK.
SHE'S PLAYED AN ALL-OUT GAME.
TWO IDOLS, IMMUNITIES, SHE'S
PLAYED THE BEST GAME WITH THIS
JURY TO GET THE VOTES TOMORROW,
AND IF YOU OR YOU MADE THE GAME
MISTAKE OF LETTING HER BE HERE
TOMORROW, I WOULD VOTE FOR HER
AND I WOULD SPEND ALL OF MY
ENERGY MAKING SURE SHE WON.
 WOW.
 Jeff: JEREMY, AND NO ONE
HAS MENTIONED YOU, TASHA.
JUST START WORKING ON THAT FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL SPEECH.
 I'M GOING TO SIT RIGHT HERE
AND SHUT UP.
 Jeff: SO JEREMY HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THIS OUT?
 THEY BOTH HAVE GOOD
ARGUMENTS.
I HAVE TO MAKE A GUT DECISION ON
THIS.
 Jeff: JEREMY, SHE 100% WINS
IF SHE'S HERE TOMORROW?
 AND YOU AREN'T GOING TO
 I THINK I HAVE A SHOT.
 I THINK YOU 100%...
 OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
THAT.
 Jeff: JEREMY, IS YOUR
DECISION BASED ON THE MOTION I
THINK THERE IS SOMEBODY I CAN
BEAT AND THAT'S WHO I'M GOING UP
AGAINST.
 UM... YES.
 Jeff: AND HAVE YOU
CONTEMPLATED THAT IF I'M WRONG,
IT IS LITERALLY A $1 MILLION
MISTAKE.
 YES.
 Jeff: AND ARE YOU READY TO
VOTE?
 YES.
 IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO VOTE FOR
ME, 100% SHE WINS.
IF I GO TO THE JURY, I WOULD
CONSIDER IT A TERRIBLE MOVE ON
YOUR PART, NO OFFENSE, BUT IT
WOULD BE A TERRIBLE MOVE, AND
BASED ON THAT MOVE, I WOULD DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SEE
HER WIN, BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE
DESERVED IT.
 Jeff: OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SPENCER, YOU'RE UP.
 RIGHT ON CUE.
I'M SO NERVOUS I CANNOT SEE
STRAIGHT.
 THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'LL BE
WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN.

 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE SPENCER.
WENTWORTH.
ONE VOTE SPENCER, ONE VOTE
WENTWORTH.
WENTWORTH.
THAT'S TWO VOTES WENTWORTH, ONE
VOTE SPENCER, ONE VOTE LEFT.
16th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE TENTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF
OUR JURY, KELLEY WENTWORTH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
WENTWORTH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKE
SPOKEEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: JEREMY, SPENCER,
TASHA, CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING
IT TO THE FINAL THREE.
YOUR SECOND-CHANCE STORY IS
ALMOST OVER, BUT THE FINAL
CHAPTER WILL BE WRITTEN BY THE
JURY.
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT ON THAT
BEAUTIFUL BEACH HERE IN CAM
BODEA.
NORMALLY I'D SAY GO BACK AND TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP, BUT YOU
MIGHT BETTER BE SERVED TO GO
BACK AND GET TO WORK ON YOUR
CASE, BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING
TOMORROW'S FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
WILL BE A BATTLE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I REALLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE
THE MOST OF THIS EXPERIENCE THIS
TIME, AND I FEEL LIKE I DID.
I PLAYED SOME IDOL, WON SOME
IMMUNITIES.
I'M BUMMED I DIDN'T MAKE IT ALL
THE WAY TO THE END.
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE THE RISK I
TOOK IN THE GAME THIS TIME WAS
EVERYTHING I WANTED TO BE, SO
I'M REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF.
 AT YOUR CONVENIENCE FOLLOW
THE TRAIL BEHIND YOUR CAMP TO
ONE ADDITIONAL SURPRISE AND SEE
THE TOLL THESE 39 DAYS HAVE
TAKEN.
 BEING IN THE FINAL THREE IS
AMAZING.
I'M SO HAPPY.
SECOND CHANCES FOR ME WAS MORE
BUSINESS, AND I APPROACHED IT
DIFFERENTLY.
I'M NERVOUS.
OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T WIN ANY IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES.
I DIDN'T PLAY ANY IDOLS, BUT THE
SOCIAL GAME I PLAYED GOT ME
HERE.
 I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE
MYSELF.
TO MAKE IT TO THE END, CRAZY.
CRAZY.
THIS TRULY WAS THE MOST
DIFFICULT THING I'VE EVER DONE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
THE CONDITIONS, THE PARANOIA,
THE LIES, I'M LIKE IN AWE
KNOWING THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO
DO IT WHEN 17 OTHER PEOPLE
COULDN'T.
I DID IT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 DAY 39!
OH, MY GOSH.
 AS MUCH AS I CAN FEEL GREAT
TODAY AND ENJOY THE COMPANY OF
TASHA AND JEREMY, JOB AIN'T
OVER.
 DAY 39.
 DAY 39.
 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO GET TO
THE FINAL THREE.
I AM HERE THE MAKE MY SECOND
CHANCE COUNT AND TO PROVE THAT
THE CHANGE THAT I'VE GONE
THROUGH DESERVES THE WIN OF
"SURVIVOR."
MAKING AN ALLIANCE, STICKING TO
IT, US THREE AT THE END BATTLING
IT OUT.
 BEAUTIFUL.
 CHEERS.
 CHEERS.
 UNLIKE THE FIRST TIME I
PLAYED, I CAME IN HERE AND SAID,
I WANT TO FORM RELATIONSHIPS AND
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE IN A WAY
THAT SPENCER COULD NOT DO
BEFORE.
AND I TRULY BELIEVE I'VE DONE
THAT.
I TOOK THE PERSONAL CHANGE IN ME
AND USED IT TO MOVE FROM THE
BOTTOM TO THE TOP.
THIS IS AN AMAZING FEELING.
THIS IS PERFECT.
TONIGHT IS THE ULTIMATE TEST,
THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION TO
EVERYTHING "SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN
FOR ME.
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT NIGHT OF
MY LIFE.
 THIS IS WHAT FINAL THREE
FEELS LIKE.
 YEAH.
 NERVE-RACKING, MAN.
MY SECOND CHANCE IS ALL ABOUT
VAL AND THE KIDS.
I JUST WANT THEM TO BE PROUD OF
ME, AND I JUST WANT THE TAKE
CARE OF THEM.
I MISS THEM SO MUCH.
I DIDN'T LEAVE THIS LONG FOR
NOTHING.
OH, MAN, CAN'T LOSE THIS.
THIS IS RIGHT THERE.
IT'S SO CLOSE.
I HAVE A ONE IN THREE SHOT AT $1
MILLION.
I WANT TO SHOW THE JURY THAT I
WAS IN CONTROL OF THIS GAME.
I HAD TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,
ONE IMMUNITY WIN.
I SURROUNDED MYSELF WITH THE
RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME,
AND EVEN UP TO THE END I FEEL
REALLY GOOD.
 I GOT TO FINISH THIS GAME,
GET THAT MONEY AND BRING IT HOME
FOR MY FAMILY.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH,
CIERA, FISHBACH, JOE, ABI,
KIMMI, KEITH AND WENTWORTH.
JEREMY, TASHA, SPENCER, YOUR
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOUR SECOND-CHANCE STORY STARTED
39 DAYS AGO.
YOUR GAME PLAY HAS BROUGHT YOU
TO THIS POINT.
YOUR CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR GAME THAT
MAKES IT MORE DESERVING THAN THE
TWO PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO YOU?
JURY, FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU
WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO ADDRESS
JEREMY, TASHA AND SPENCER.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
INFORMATION TO MAKE A $1 MILLION
DECISION.
SAVAGE, GET US STARTED.
 ARGUABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT
SEASON IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR."
I APPLAUD EACH ONE OF YOU.
GETTING TO THE FINAL THREE IS
MONUMENTAL IN AN EPIC SEASON, SO
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE
UNDERSTANDS THAT MY VOTE IS
COMPLETELY OPEN RIGHT NOW, AND
IT'S NOT JUST MY VOTE, IT'S MOST
IF NOT ALL OF THE JURY MEMBERS.
I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE THE
QUESTIONS YOU'RE GOING TO GET,
ALL THE ANSWERS NEED TO BE FULL
AND HONEST AND HEARTFELT,
BECAUSE EVERY ANSWER HAS THE
POTENTIAL FOR $1 MILLION IMPACT.
THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS, SO
PLEASE TAKE THAT TO HEART.
SAME GOING TO FOCUS ON JEREMY
AND SPENCER.
SPENCER, YOUR LEVEL OF ARROGANCE
DROVE ME CRAZY.
YOU BARK OUT THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BURY JEREMY IF HE DOESN'T
TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL.
WHAT ASTOUNDED ME IS THAT YOU
DID THAT IN FRONT OF THE JURY.
DO YOU HAVE REGRETS ABOUT THE
ARROGANCE THAT YOU DISPLAYED TO
PUT YOUR BUTT IN THAT SEAT RIGHT
NOW?
 WHEN I CAME INTO THIS GAME
THE FIRST TIME, I WAS ARROGANT,
AND I REALIZE THAT ARROGANCE IS
A MASK FOR INSECURITIES.
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE
WORKED ON.
LAST NIGHT MY CONFIDENCE MIGHT
HAVE GOTTEN CARRIED AWAY, AND IT
MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED BACK TOWARD
WHO I WAS, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT
I'VE GAINED A LOT OF
SELF-AWARENESS, SO I DON'T
REGRET THE MOVE, BUT I REGRET
HOW I PRESENTED IT.
 SPENCER.
THANK YOU, I DO APPRECIATE YOUR
HONESTY.
JEREMY, YOU'RE UP.
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL WHERE KIMMI WAS VOTED
OUT.
EVERY SYLLABLE FROM YOUR MOUTH
AND ACTION FROM YOUR BODY IS
VIEWED CRITICALLY BY THE JURY,
AND YOU'RE SKIPPING AND YOU'RE
VERBALLY ATTACKING KIMMI, WHO IS
JUST TRYING TO STAY IN THIS
GAME.
SO YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN TO ME
YOUR LEVEL OF ARROGANCE THAT WE
ALL OBSERVED.
 I DON'T FEEL I WAS BEING
ARROGANT.
I WAS UPSET.
THAT WHOLE DAY THESE TWO ARE
TELLING ME THAT KIMMI FLIPPED, I
SAID, KIMMI'S NOT FLIPPING, SO
WHEN SHE TOOK THAT AND USED IT
AGAINST ME, I WAS UPSET.
I SAID, KIMMI, SHAME ON YOU, AND
I SKIPPED OVER AND WROTE HER
NAME DOWN.
I WAS VERY UPSET.
SHE HURT MY FEELINGS, AND THAT
WAS MY REACTION.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: FISHBACH.
 GUYS, FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.
JEREMY, I THINK YOU BROUGHT
TRUST, HONOR AND INTEGRITY INTO
A SEASON WHERE IT DIDN'T EXIST.
TASHA, MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS
I'VE SEEN YOU A SMART, STRONG
STRATEGIST, BUT I THINK THERE IS
A PERCEPTION OF YOU AS THE
PERSON WHO DID JEREMY'S WORK
SOME DEFEND OR DENY YOUR ROLE AS
BEING THAT PERSON.
 LET ME JUST DISPEL THE MYTH.
I'M A STRONG, INDEPENDENT WOMAN.
NO ONE DICTATES ANYTHING TO ME
IN LIFE OR IN "SURVIVOR."
I PLAYED MY GAME.
ANY TIME THAT THERE WAS A
DECISION THAT I FELT WAS IN
DIRECT CONFLICT WITH WHAT I
WANTED TO DO, I DUG IN MY HEELS
AND GOT WHAT I WANTED.
 I'VE ALWAYS EXPECTED REALLY
STRONG STRATEGIC PLAY FROM YOU,
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN REALLY
SURPRISE YOU BECAME SO COLONIZED
BY THIS IDEA OF VOTING BOCKS AND
THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO BETRAY
PEOPLE.
 I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE CLOSE
RELATIONSHIPS, SO I PROBABLY HAD
TO DO MORE BACKSTABBING AND MORE
JUMPING BETWEEN BLOCS AT THE
EXPENSE OF RELATIONSHIPS, AT THE
EXPENSE OF YOURS.
 THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE
WORDS.
THANK YOU GUYS AND
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ALL.
IT'S A TREMENDOUS
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
 Jeff: CIERA.
 HI, GUYS.
 HI.
 HI.
 SO ON A TYPICAL "SURVIVOR"
SEASON, FLIPPERS RARELY MAKE IT
TO THE END AND THEY NEVER WIN.
THIS SEASON THERE WERE NO MORE
ALLIANCES.
THERE WERE VOTING BLOCS, AND
VOTING BLOCS REQUIRED FLIPPING,
LEAVING A JURY THAT FEELS
EXTREMELY BETRAYED.
SO ME QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO
ALL OF YOU: WHY THIS SEASON,
UNLIKE ANY OTHER SEASON, SHOULD
FLIPPING BE REWARDED?
 WELL, FOR ME THIS SEASON WAS
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF
CALIBER OF THE PLAYERS.
LIKE THIS IS ARGUABLY THE BEST
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" EVER.
AND YOU COMING IN SAYING, MAKE A
BIG MOVE, MAKE A BIG PLAY, I
THINK THAT OPENED UP A LOT OF
AVENUES TO MOVE AROUND.
SO IT WASN'T NECESSARILY
FLIPPERS, IT WAS JUST VOTING
BLOCS THAT ARE MOVING.
 OKAY.
 FOR ME, I THINK IT IS A
RESULT OF MULTIPLE SWAPS.
WHEN I WENT INTO BAYON, I MADE
SOME DEALS WITH PEOPLE.
THEN I'M ON ANGKOR, BOSTON UM,
MADE SOME DEALS.
THERE CAME BACK THE BAYON, MADE
SOME DEALS THERE.
SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS
MAKE SURE I SURVIVED, SO
FLIPPING WAS SOMETHING THAT
NEEDED TO BE DONE.
 OKAY.
SPENCE?
 I THINK THAT THIS SEASON
THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT THE
VOTING BLOCS WERE VERY FLUID,
AND I THINK WHEN THERE WERE
BLURRED LINES, I HAD TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEM, AND FOR ME IT
MEANT BLIND SIDING PHYSICAL AND
STRATEGIC AND SOCIAL THREATS,
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION
WHERE I COULD CLIMB TO THE TOP.
 OKAY.
THANKS, GUYS.
 Bianca:.
 Jeff: THANKS, CIERA.
KEITH.
 YEAH.
GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'LL KNOW MY STYLE OF PLAY.
WHERE I'M FROM, BEING HUMBLE IS
A PRETTY BIG THING.
JEREMY, MY QUESTION IS CONVINCE
ME WHY YOU THINK SPENCER IS
DESERVING TO WIN.
IF YOU CONVINCE ME SPENCER IS A
WINNER, YOU'RE THE REAL WINNER,
AND I WANT THE FEEL IT, AND
SPENCER YOU THE SAME AFTER IT'S
OVER.
 I THINK SPENCER PLAYED A
SOLID GAME.
SPENCER CAME FROM THE BOTTOM.
HE WAS ALMOST ELIMINATED TWO
TRIBALS IN A ROW.
HE MADE SOME GOOD MOVES.
HE PLAYED THE MIDDLE GROUND.
HE HAD THREE IMMUNITIES...
 THAT'S YOUR PITCH?
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SPENCEER IS A
MILLION DOLLAR WINNER.
 SPENCEER IS A VERY
INTELLIGENT PLAYER.
 SPENCE?
 DEFINITELY HEADED INTO THE
MERGE, JEREMY HAD A LOT OF
CONTROL AND A LOT OF STRONG
RELATIONSHIPS, AND HE REALLY PUT
HIMSELF IN A POWERFUL POSITION.
SO I THINK HE DESERVES A LOT OF
CREDIT FOR THAT.
 OKAY.
I'M GOOD, JEFF.
 Jeff: THANKS, BUDDY.
 THANKS, KEITH.
 Jeff: ABI.
 HI, YOU GUYS.
I HAVE NOTES.
"SURVIVOR" IS A GAME OF BIG
MOVES, BUT I WANT TO HEAR WHAT
WAS YOUR SUBTLE MOVE THAT GOT
YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE
AT RIGHT NOW?
TASHA?
 MY SUBTLE MOVE WAS
RECONNECTING WITH SPENCER,
COMING INTO THIS GAME WITH THREE
OTHER CAGAYAN PLAYERS, WE HAD
TARGETS ON OUR BACK.
WHILE EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE POWER COUPLE, MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH SPENCER WAS
PROBABLY TEN TIMES STRONGER AND
THAT WAS MY SUBTLE MOVE.
 OKAY.
SPENCER?
 MY SUBTLE MOVE HAD A LOT TO
DO WITH JOE BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO
IN THE MIDDLE, AND IT WAS
DANGEROUS TO SIT IN THAT MIDDLE
PLACE, SO I THINK MY SUBTLE MOVE
WAS TRYING TO SHIFT THAT
DISTRUST MORE ON HIM THAN ON ME.
 OKAY.
JEREMY?
 WELL, ON REWARD CHALLENGES,
MY TEAM ALWAYS LOSES.
I GO BACK TO CAMP, BUT I THINK
THE SUBTLE MOVE WAS I'M HUNTING
FOR IDOLS.
I FIND TWO OF THEM, AND I HAD MY
LIBERTY TO PLAY IT, AND IT
BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER.
MY GAME MOVES FORWARD.
 THANKS FOR OWNING YOUR MOVES,
YOU GUYS.
CONGRATS.
 THANKS, ABI.
 Jeff: KIMMI, YOU'RE UP.
 SPENCER, LAST NIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL YOU WERE BEING A DOESN'T
RIGHT BULLY, AND I WILL USE THAT
BEHAVIOR AS AN EXAMPLE TO MY
CHILDREN AS TO WHAT THEY SHOULD
NEVER DO.
AS FOR JEREMY, ME, YOU, TASHA,
WE HAD AN ALLIANCE, AND NOW ALL
OF A SUDDEN SPENCER COMES IN,
AND HE REPLACES ME IN A PECKING
ORDER, AND THE TWO OF YOU LET
SPENCER COME IN AND RUIN, YOU
KNOW, A TIGHT FAMILY THAT WE
HAD.
 I NEVER SAID SPENCER REPLACED
YOU.
YOU SAID SPENCER REPLACED YOU.
I ALWAYS SAID THAT YOU'RE WITH
ME.
I HAD FAITH IF YOU AND SAID
KIMMI IS WITH ME.
SO THAT'S WHY I SAID, WHO WROTE
MY NAME DOWN?
IT CAN'T BE KIMMI.
AND IT HURT MY FEELINGS BECAUSE
I WAS DUPED BY KIMMI KAPPENBERG.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: THANKS, KIMMI.
JOE.
 MY VOTE IS OPEN, COMPLETELY
OPEN TONIGHT.
I FIGURED IT WOULD BE THE BEST
WAY TO END THIS SEASON BEING
OBJECTIVE AND HAVE A GREAT
WINNER FOR A GREAT SEASON.
SO TASH, I THINK YOU WEREN'T
AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
AROUND YOU.
LIKE JEREMY TOLD YOU TO DO
THINGS AND YOU WERE RUNNING
AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
WAS GOING ON, SO I WOULD LIKE
ONE MOMENT WHEN YOU SAID, THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF MY
CONTROL, AND I WAS ABLE TO
HARNESS IT AND TURN IT AROUND.
 I COME FROM CORPORATE
AMERICA.
I DEAL WITH ALPHA MALES ALL THE
TIME.
THERE'S A GAME WITHIN THE GAME.
 SO DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE.
 YEAH, EXACTLY, YOUR VOTE OUT.
JEREMY WAS CONFLICTED EVEN AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THEY'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER,
SHOULD WE DO THIS, BECAUSE THEY
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT ABALL-GIRL
ALLIANCE, BUT WHEN I FELT IT WAS
CRITICAL FOR ME TO STEP IN FOR
THE BETTERMENT OF OUR ALLIANCE,
WHICH WE'RE HERE NOW, I DID.
OTHER TIMES I PICK AND CHOSE MY
BATTLES BECAUSE THAT'S THE GAME
WITHIN THE GAME.
 OKAY.
THANK YOU.
 THANKS, JOE.
 Jeff: KELLW WIGLESWORTH.
 15 YEARS AGO I WAS SITTING
RIGHT THERE.
I LOST BY ONE VOTE.
MY FATE WAS DETERMINED BY ONE
SIMPLE QUESTION: JEREMY, TASH,
YEAH SPENCER, PICK A NUMBER
BETWEEN ONE AND TEN.
 RIGHT NOW?

 TWO.
 THREE.
 FOUR.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: KASS, YOU'RE UP.
 I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR
ONE PERSON.
SPENCER, IN CAGAYAN WHEN I
FLIPPED AT THE MERGE,
REPOSITIONING MYSELF, YOU
FAMOUSLY SAID, "KASS, 0% CHANCE
OF WINNING.
EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD HERE
TONIGHT, YOU PLAYED LIKE CHAOS
KASS.
HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO GIVE YOU
MY VOTE FOR $1 MILLION WIN WHEN
YOU SPENT TWO YEARS SAYING I'M A
DUMB ASS?"
 I KNOW I'VE SAID A LOT OF
THINGS, AND I THINK SYSTEM OF
THEM DID COME OUT OF A PLACE OF
ANGER FROM OUR SEASON.
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S
HYPOCRITICAL OF ME TO ASK FOR
YOUR VOTE BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE
I'VE CHANGED.
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE
SPENCER THAT ASKS FOR YOUR VOTE
NOW IS NOT THE SAME SPENCER THAT
SAID YOU HAD 0% CHANCE OF
WINNING.
 YOU KNOW, CONGRATULATIONS FOR
TRYING TO CHANGE, YOU KNOW, AND
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE IT, TOO,
AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A VERY
IMPORTANT THING FOR BOTH OF US,
SO, YOU KNOW, GOOD LUCK TONIGHT
AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL HAVE
A BEER LATER.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, FINISH IT
OUT.
 WELL, WELL, WELL, NO SURPRISE
IT'S YOU THREE SITTING THERE.
YOU KNOW, I'M FRESH OUT OF THIS
GAME.
THIS IS STILL REALLY RAW FOR ME.
I'M STILL PROCESSING.
WHAT I DO KNOW IS I CAME INTO
THIS GAME WANTING TO PLAY MY
SECOND CHANCE AS AN INDIVIDUAL,
AND I DID THAT.
WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND CHANCE
STORY ABOUT?
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
ACCOMPLISHED IT?
TASHA?
 MY SECOND-CHANCE STORY HAS
BEEN TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN
RELATIONSHIPS, MAKING SURE THAT
THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS WORKING
WITH KNEW EVERY DAY THEY HAD THE
LOYALTY AND THE TRUST OF AN
ALLIANCE.
THAT WAS MY SECOND-CHANCE STORY.
 SPENCER?
 MY SECOND-CHANCE STORY HAS
BEEN TEETERING BETWEEN WHO I WAS
AND WHO I AM TRYING TO BE NOW.
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR," I HAD NO PEOPLE
SKILLS.
AND IT HURT A LOT TO ADMIT THOSE
THINGS TO MYSELF, BUT ONCE I
DID, I DID START WORKING ON IT,
AND I DID COME IN HERE, BRINGING
THAT TO THE GAME TO PLAY HOW I
COULDN'T IN CAGAYAN.
MAYBE WITH BLOOD ON MY HAND, BUT
I TRULY BELIEVE I MADE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I COULDN'T
HAVE MADE BEFORE.
 JEREMY?
 MY SECOND-CHANCE STORY...
LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M
HERE FOR VAL, I'M HERE FOR
JORDAN, I'M HERE FOR CAMERON.
EVERYTHING I'M DOING IS FOR
THEM.
BEFORE I LEFT, VAL COMES UP AND
TELLS ME SHE'S PREGNANT, SO I'M
HERE AND I'M BUGGING OUT BECAUSE
I KNOW I'M MISSING THIS, YOU
KNOW?
SO VAL COMES ON THE VISIT AND
SHE SAYS SHE'S FINE, THE BABY'S
FINE AND HE'S A BOY.
AND EVERY DAY I WANT TO TELL ALL
YOU ALL THAT I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A
SON, AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU
ALL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MESS
UP MY GAME, I DON'T WANT TO MESS
UP ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M DOING IT
FOR THEM.
SO MY SECOND CHANCE IS ALL ABOUT
FAMILY.
THAT'S IT.
I'M NOT DOING IT FOR NOTHING
ELSE.
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT ME.
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS MY FAMILY.
THAT'S MY SECOND CHANCE.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: NICE FINISH.
EREMY, TASH,A, SPENCER, THERE IS
ONE THING LEFT TO DO, AND THAT
IS VOTE.
JURY, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A
MOMENT TO TAKE IN EVERYTHING YOU
JUST HEARD AND YOU'LL MAKE THE
SINGLE BIGGEST DECISION OF THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY.
IT IS A TIME TO MAKE A MILLION
DOLLAR DECISION.
TONIGHT YOU ARE VOTING FOR A
WINNER, THE PERSON YOU THINK
MOST DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF
SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION
CHECK THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.
SAVAGE, YOU'RE UP.
 THIS IS A REALLY, REALLY HARD
DECISION FOR ME, BUT YOU GUYS
REALLY BATTLED IT OUT.
 FATE IS ON YOUR SIDE TONIGHT.
 Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE
VOTES.
THANK YOU FOR A GREAT SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."
THANK YOU FOR CHANGE YOUR
SECOND-CHANCE ADVENTURES.
I'LL SEE ALL OF YOU BACK IN LOS
ANGELES FOR THE READING OF THE
VOTES.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Anchor: ALL RIGHT.
WOW.
AWESOME.
MAN, I GOT TO SAY, THANK YOU TO
ALL YOU GUYS IN THE NON-JURY,
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT HERE FOR
WHAT HAS TRULY BEEN, AT LEAST
FOR ME, AN ELECTRIFYING SEASON
TO WATCH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FROM DAY ONE YOU ALL PLAYED
HARD.
YOU BLED, AND IT WAS A BLAST.
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
JEREMY, TASH, YEAH SPENCER, THIS
SEASON I THINK MORE THAN ANY
REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW DIFFICULT
IT IS TO GET TO THE END.
YOU GOT THERE.
NOW IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE
JURY.
IT IS TIME TO READ THE VOTES.
THESE ARE VOTES FOR A WINNER.
HERE WE GO.
FIRST VOTE JEREMY.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
JEREMY.
TWO VOTES JEREMY.
JEREMY.
THREE VOTES JEREMY.
JEREMY.
FOUR VOTES JEREMY.
JEREMY.
FIVE VOTES JEREMY.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: SECOND
CHANCE," JEREMY.
THAT'S IT.
JEREMY JUST WON $1 MILLION.
HELLO, VAL.
ALL RIGHT.
VAL IS HERE.
SHE'S FULL TERM.
SHE COULD GIVE BIRTH AT ANY
MOMENT, AND IT HAS BEEN A SEASON
OF FIRSTS, SO YOU NEVER KNOW.
JEFFREY COLLINS, NOT A BAD NAME.
THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOMENTS
THIS SEASON, WE'RE GOING TO GET
EVERYBODY OUT HERE AND TALK
ABOUT ALL OF THEM.
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR: SECOND
CHANCE" REUNION SHOW LIVE FROM
LOS ANGELES NEXT.
