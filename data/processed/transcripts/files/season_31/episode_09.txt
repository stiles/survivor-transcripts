         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE, NO
ONE WAS TAKING THEIR SECOND
CHANCE FOR GRANTED.
 YOU HAVE TO HIT THE GROUND
RUNNING.
 Jeff: TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS HAD ALREADY BEEN FOUND.
 I LOVE IT.
 Jeff: JOE CONTINUED TO WIN.
JOE WINS HIS SECOND INDIVIDUAL








IMMUNITY CHALLENGE!
AND WENTWORTH, ABI AND CIERA
WERE ON THE BOTTOM FIGHTING TO
STAY ALIVE.
 I'M SO FRICKEN TIRED OF THEIR
HALF HASS PLAN.
 I'M GOING TO THROW ANYTHING I
CAN THROW TRYING TO GET SOMEBODY
TO CATCH ON TO IT.
 AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IT WAS
CLEAR THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR" HAD
EVOLVED.
 I DON'T AGREE THERE'S A
BOTTOM HERE.








IT'S IN THE HIRE, A CAL HERE.
 Jeff: AND WEBT WORTH
DECIDED TO TAKE THE GAME INTO
HER OWN HANDS.
 THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
 Jeff: PUTTING AN END TO
SAVAGE'S SECOND CHANCE.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT, THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
11 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 #HIDDENIMMUNITYIDOL.
 WAIT, I WANT THE START BY
SAYING... I'M SURE I GOT A
LITTLE WORKED UP.
I FEEL BETRAYED BY SOME OF YOU.
 THAT WAS BAD ASS.
 WELL PLAYED.
 I WAS GOING TO EXPLODE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
HELLO.
I'M KELLEY WENTWORTH.
I JUST MANEUVERED SAVAGE OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SECOND CHANCE."
I FEEL LIKE I'VE COME SO FAR
FROM "BLOOD VERSUS WATER" TO
WHERE I AM HERE, HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, GREAT PLAY BY KELLEY
WENTWORTH.
 OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
 I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A
DIFFERENT PERSON.
I WANTED TO TAKE RISKS AND MAKE
MOVES.
IT'S LIKE THE BEST FEELING I'VE
HAD OUT HERE IN 21 DAYS.
 BUT IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE
THREE GOES HOME NEXT TIME
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LET THE THREE
OF THEM ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOME
FRIENDS WITH TASH AND JEREMY.
NIX THAT.
 NOW I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE
BREAK UP THE LITTLE WITCH'S
COVEN.
 KIMMI IS CALLING CIERA,
WENTWORTH AND ABI LIKE THE THREE
WITCHES FROM MACBETH THAT ARE
STIRRING THEIR CAULDRON.
ABI IS HOTHEADED.
CIERA, TOIL, LET'S MAKE A MOVE,
LET'S MAKE A MOVE.
AND WENTWORTH IS TROUBLE.
SHE'S BRINGING OUT IDOLS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE KING
DUNCAN WHO GETS KILLED IN THE
NIGHT.
I WANT TO DO THE KILLING IN THE
NIGHT.
THOSE WITCHES ARE BREWING
SOMETHING EPIC, BUT HOW DO I GET
THE WITCHES TO MAKE THE POTION
THAT'S RIGHT FOR ME?
 THAT WAS WILD LAST NIGHT.
 SAVAGE IS GONE.
KELLEY HAD TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF
CLUE.
 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN
SOMETHING.
 YOU'VE GOT TO BE DANG LUCKY.
 SAVAGE GOING HOME SCREWS ME.
I HAD ANOTHER MAN THAT NOBODY
REALLY LIKED THAT I KNEW WAS A
SHIELD FOR ME.
BUT EVEN THOUGH I TRUST STEPHEN
AND I HAVE ONE IDOL TO PROTECT
ME, I NEED TWO IDOLS BECAUSE
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME.
I GOT THE LOOK.
I GOT TO BUST MY BEHIND AGAIN.
LIKE, OH, MY GOD.
 WE HAVE TO GO FIND AN IDOL.
 I KNOW.
 WHAT ABOUT OVER HERE?
 I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY THE
STAND OUT.
 YEAH.
 GOT THE FIND THAT HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
NOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING,
OKAY, JOE'S WON TWO IMMUNITIES.
HE'S GOT TO GO.
HE LOSE, HE'S GOT TO GO.
I SPENT 30 MINUTES TODAY LOOKING
FOR THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
THAT'S GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO MY
SURVIVAL.
JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
 RIGHT IN HERE?
 I WANT TO BE ALONE.
DO YOU MIND JUST GOING, TEN
MINUTES.
I'LL BE DONE IN TEN MINUTES.
I PROMISE.
ALL RIGHT.
 I RUN ENTER JOE LOOKING FOR
AN IDOL.
HE KNOWS THAT HE'S IN TROUBLE,
AND HE'S NERVOUS.
AND I LOVE IT.
 I JUST CAUGHT JOE LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL DESPERATELY.
SWEAR TO GOD.
 OVER THERE?
 OVER THERE BY THE TREE MAIL.
 DUH.
IT'S LIKE, THERE IS A GROUP OF
EIGHT THAT'S VOTING TOGETHER
SUPPOSEDLY.
BUT THERE'S PARANOIA WITHIN THE
EIGHT, WHICH IS GREAT FOR ME.
LIKE I AM SO HOPING THAT PEOPLE
ARE FINALLY READY TO GET THIS
GAME STARTED.
MY LORD, PLEASE LET'S HAVE A BIG
MOVE AT THE NEXT TRIBAL.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE IN.
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'LL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS
OF FIVE.
ON MY DWORK YOU'LL USE WOODEN
POLLS TO BUILD A STAIRCASE.
YOU THEN MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A
MAZE AND DOWN A SLIDE.
ONE PERSON WILL THEN NAVIGATE A
KEY THROUGH A ROPE OBSTACLE.
HE'LL THEN USE THAT KEY TO OPEN
A CHEST.
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS WILL USE THE
PIECES INSIDE THAT CHEST TO
SOLVE A PUZZLE THAT WILL REVEAL
THREE NUMBERS TO A COMBINATION.
FIRST TEAM TO GET THEIR
COMBINATION SOLVED AND THEIR
FLAG RAISED WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: THE WINNING FIVE WILL
BE TAKEN FROM HER TO OUR
"SURVIVOR" SPA.
YOU'LL START WITH THE FIRST
SHOWER YOU'VE HAD IN 22 DAYS.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
 Jeff: YOU'LL THEN HAVE A
TRADITIONAL CAMBODIAN MASSAGE,
INCREASE YOUR BLOOD CIRCULATION,
REPAIR THOSE BEAT-UP MUSCLES.
THEN YOU WILL EAT SPA FOOD,
SANDWICH, SALADS, DESSERTS.
YOU'LL RUN BACK TO CAMP
REJUVENATED, REFRESHED AND WELL
FED.
THIS CHALLENGE FIRST RAN IN
BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS
BEAUTY.
TASH AND SPENCER WERE IN THE
GAME ON THE SAME TRIBE.
SPENCER DID THE PUZZLE.
THEY LOST.
ANOTHER BIG SECOND CHANCE
OPPORTUNITY.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL THIS A SCHOOLYARD PICK,
WHICH MEANS ONE PERSON WILL NOT
PARTICIPATE.
LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
TASHA WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE SELECTED FISHBACH, SPENCER,
JOE AND CIERA.
WIGLESWORTH WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE SELECTED KEITH, WENTWORTH,
KIMMI AND JEREMY.
ABI WAS NOT SELECTED.
SHE WILL HAVE NO SHOT AT REWARD.
HERE WE GO, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THE FIRST GOAL IS TO BUILD A
STAIRCASE, WHICH WILL TAKE YOU
TO THE TOP OF THE MAZE.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE LENGTH
OF THE POLE DOES NOT NECESSARILY
CORRESPOND WITH THE POSITION IT
WILL HAVE BECAUSE EACH OF THE
SLOTS ARE AT A DIFFERENT DEPTH.
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A SHORT POST
THAT GOES TOWARD THE END AND A
LISTENING POST THAT GOES TOWARD
THE FRONT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO WORK
TOGETHER AND THESE POSTS ARE
VERY HEAVY.
YOU WILL NOTICE A GRADUAL
INCLINE.
IF YOU DON'T NOTICE IT MOVING
GRADUALLY TO THE TOP, YOU'RE NOT
RIGHT.
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
PROGRESS.
IT WILL LOOK LIKE YOU CAN STEP
FROM ONE POST TO ANOTHER.
 YEP, YEP.
 Jeff: PURPLE STARTING TO
GET SOME MOMENTUM NOW.
THEY'RE STARTING TO FIGURE IT
OUT.
GREEN STILL CHAOTIC OVER THERE,
MAKING VERY LITTLE PROGRESS.
PURPLE NOW STARTING TO PULL
AHEAD.
THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE RIGHT.
IS THIS IT?
YES!
THEY'VE GOT IT.
HEAD ON.
PURPLE NOW OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD.
MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE MAZE.
 THIS IS WRONG, TO THINK.
 Jeff: GREEN STILL TRYING TO
GET SOMETHING GOING.
PURPLE PULLING AHEAD.
JOE HEADING DOWN.
BIG LEAD RIGHT NOW FOR PURPLE.
GREEN STILL WORKING WITH THEIR
POST.
 COME ON, FISHBACH.
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE OUT HERE.
SPENCER NOW HEADS OUT.
ONE PERSON.
JOE GOING THE START WORKING THAT
KEY THROUGH THE ROPE OBSTACLE.
ONCE YOU'RE THROUGH EVERYBODY
GOES THROUGH.
GREEN IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO
GETTING THEIR POSTS IN ORDER.
JOE ALMOST THROUGH, EXTENDING
THE LEAD.
GO, EVERYBODY!
HUGE LEAD ADVANTAGE FOR PURPLE
RIGHT NOW.
 NO!
 Jeff: GREEN MAY NEVER CATCH
UP.
TWO PEOPLE NOW ON THE PUZZLE FOR
PURPLE.
IT'S SPENCER AND CIERA WHILE
GREEN IS ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.
 WHERE WE GOING WITH THIS?
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
BLOWOUTS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
SPENCER LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION.
HE TOOK THE PUZZLE ON THE FIRST
TIME HE PLAYED THIS CHALLENGE
AND LOST.
 THIS IS DAMN EMBARRASSING.
 YEAH, IT IS.
 Jeff: ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR
THE GREEN TRIBE.
FIVE PEOPLE, NINE POSTS AND THEY
CAN'T GET IT.
SPENCER AND CIERA A LOT OF TIME
TO LOOK TOGETHER.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE NUMBERS
THAT WILL HELP YOU SOLVE THAT
COMBINATION AND WIN THAT REWARD.
CIERA WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
THE GREEN TEAM IS STILL WORKING
ON THEIR POSTS.
AND THEY FINALLY HAVE IT.
LET'S GO.
SPENCER AND CIERA NOW SLOWING
DOWN.
THEY MADE A LOT OF QUICK
PROGRESS.
JEREMY IS DOWN WITH A BIG, HARD
FALL.
WIGLESWORTH TAKES A FALL.
HERE COMES KIMMI, WENTWORTH.
 OH, MY GOSH, THAT HURT.
 Jeff: AND KEITH.
ONE PERSON.
IT'S GOING TO BE JEREMY LOOPING
THAT KEY THROUGH THE ROPE
OBSTACLE.
CAN HE DO IT QUICKLY?
 LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
 Jeff: THEY HAVE THE TREE
NUMBERS.
DO THEY HAVE THEM IN THE RIGHT
ORDER?
IS THAT CORRECT?
THE NUMBERS IN THE PUZZLE HAVE
TO MATCH THE NUMBERS ON THE
COMBINATION.
IF NOT YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT.
 GO, TWO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: JEREMY THROUGH.
FOR THE WIN, DO THEY HAVE IT?
YES!
REWARD AND REDEMPTION FOR
SPENCER AND TASHA WITH A NICE
REWARD AT THE SURVIVOR SPA.
NICE REWARD.
YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO THE
"SURVIVOR" SPA.
SHOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT AND
ENJOY.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, KIMMI,
ABI, WIGLESWORTH, JEREMY, KEITH,
GUYS, HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 WE WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
THIS WHOLE GAME IS A WASTE OF A
DAY.
THIS IS A BAD ONE.
LAST NIGHT WAS BAD.
SAVAGE WENT HOME.
TODAY IS BAD.
IT GOES UP AND DOWN.
TODAY'S DOWN.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WOW.
 OH, WOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WE HAD AN AMAZING REWARD,
MASSAGE, A FRESH SHOWER.
 CHEERS TO GOOD FRIENDS.
 BLOWOUT.
 AWESOME REWARD.
 FOOD IN THIS GAME SO
VALUABLE.
IT KEEPS YOUR MIND RIGHT, KEEPS
YOUR BODY RIGHT.
 THIS IS JUST HAPPINESS ON THE
TABLE.
 GOING INTO AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, IT'S A COMPETITIVE
EDGE OVER EVERYONE ELSE.
WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE IN THE
TANK.
 OH, MY GOD, THESE ROLLS ARE
GREAT.
 THERE IS DEFINITELY STRATEGY
GOING INTO REWARD.
IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE ALONE
TIME WITH A DIFFERENT GROUP OF
PEOPLE THAT MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T
GET IN CAMP.
 ARE WE TALKING STRATEGY AT
ALL OR ARE WE TALKING FOOD ONLY?
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I'M CLEARLY ON
THE OUTS, SO IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN
REALLY SAY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
HAVE ANYBODY, YOU KNOW, MY
CLOSEST PERSON WAS KASS.
 AS THE GAME MOVES ON, YOU
HAVE FEWER AND FEWER VOTES, AND
YOU NEED TO USE EVERY ONE OF
THOSE VOTES STRATEGICALLY.
AND ABI AND CIERA ARE WORKING
HARDER THAN THE DOMINANT
ALLIANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE
DESPERATE, SO THOSE ARE THE ONES
WHO DESERVE TO BE HERE.
 I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT
BECAUSE I'M QUEEN OF JUST SAYING
THINGS.
I KNOW A FEW OF YOU ARE VERY
CLOSE WITH JEREMY, BUT I PROMISE
TO GOD, YOU GO TO THE END WITH
JEREMY, YOU DON'T WIN.
 IN THIS SEASON OF SURVIVOR,
EVERYONE SEES THE HIERARCHY AND
EVERYONE WANTS TO FLIP IT ON ITS
HEAD.
SO TO PLAY THIS OLD SCHOOL GAME
WHERE WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE OF
FIVE AND THAT FIVE HAS A FOUR
WITHIN IT AND A THREE WITHIN IT
AND A TWO WITHIN IT, IT'S JUST
NOT GOING TO HOLD.
IT'S GOING TO GETDY DISFLED.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
WIGGLES?
 SHE HAS THE FIRST SEASON.
SHE'S BEEN VERY SMART.
 YES.
 HER SOCIAL ABILITY, SHE TALKS
TO EVERYONE.
 YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
 NO ONE DISLIKES WIGGLES.
 I THINK THERE'S VOTING BLOCS
THAT MAKE SENSE, AND THE NEXT
DAY THAT COULD BE COMPLETELY OUT
THE WINDOW.
I THINK THIS IS MOVING MUCH
FASTER AND VERY DIFFERENT THAN
THE GAME HAS EVER IN THE PAST.
 OKAY.
SO WE'LL SAVE TWO BIG CLAMS FOR
TOMORROW.
 I'M PISSED OFF THIS WE LOST,
AND NOT THAT WE JUST LOST BUT WE
LOST BY SO MUCH.
WE GOT CRUSHED.
BUT WITH ONLY FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
THEY'RE COOKING AND TALKING AND
EVERYTHING.
THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME GO AND
LEAVE ME ALONE, AND I WENT AND
LOOKED FOR THE IDOL.
I WANTED TO CHECK TREE MAIL.
AN I'M DIGGING AROUND TREE MAIL
AND EVERYTHING, AND NOTHING
AROUND THERE.
AND THE FIRST IDOL I GOT WAS IN
A TREE UNDER LEAVES, SO I WAS
LIKE, THERE'S A HUGE TREE AT
TREE MAIL.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
WHEN I TURNED AROUND, LIKE IT
WAS JUST STARING AT ME.
THIS IS SO CRAZY.
NOT AGAIN, MAN.
NOT A FREAKING AGAIN.
I'VE GOT TO BE INCONSPICUOUS.
TONIGHT AFTER EVERYONE ELSE LIES
DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP, MAKE YOUR
MOVE AND FOLLOW THE MAP AND LOOK
FOR THE LANTERN.
YOU WILL FIND THE SECURITY YOU
SEEK.
SO IT'S LIKE THE SAME TRAIL WE
DID FOR THE MERGE.
I HAD A BAD DAY TODAY, BUT
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.
OH, I CAN'T WAIT.
I'M SO STOKED RIGHT NOW.
 AS SOON AS THE MOON GOES
DOWN, THE TEAM THAT WON CAME
BACK FROM THEIR SPA TREATMENT.
EVERYBODY IS USUALLY IN BED
READY FOR BED.
I THOUGHT, THIS WILL BE SO EASY.
I'LL JUST GET UP.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE WATCHING
ME.
 YOU KNOW, YOU COME ON DOWN.
YOU KNOW, GO... SO I'M LIKE,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
EVERYBODY IS BY THE FIRE,
HANGING OUT, LIKE NO ONE EVER,
THEY NEVER EVER DO THIS.
IT WAS CRAZY.
 DON'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT NOW.
FINALLY I'M JUST LIKE I GOT TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.
THAT FOOD HIT MY STOMACH.
THEN I MADE A DASH FOR IT.
I TOOK OFF.
IT WAS PARTISANSHIP BLACK.
THERE'S ROCK, THERE'S TREES.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE.
THERE'S SNAKES AND EVERYTHING.
AND I'M JUST SMACKING BRANCHES
OUT OF MY FACE.
FROM A DISTANCE I SEE A LITTLE
GLOW.
SO I KIND OF TOOK OFF AFTER IT.
WHOA BABY.
LOOK AT THAT THING.
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IDOLS THIS SEASON, THERE'S NO
TWO IDOLS THAT LOOK THE SAME.
AND HACKING FROM THE LANTERN WAS
THIS BEAUTIFUL THING.
WE GOT ANOTHER PIECE.
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS, BUT NOW I
GOT TWO IDOLS, TWO HIDDEN IDOLS.
TWO IDOL, ALL THE MORE
AGGRESSIVE, THAT'S ME.
THIS IS AN IDOL.
THIS IS VAL'S IDOL.
THIS ONE IS VAL'S IDOL.
THE OTHER ONE IS VAL'S IDOL.
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.
I LOVE IT!
VAL IS MY WIFE.
VAL IS MY BEST FRIEND.
I CAN'T KEEP IT BOTTLED UP
ANYMORE.
I'M DOING IT ALL FOR HER.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE HER LIFE A
LITTLE EASIER.
I WANT TO MAKE LIFE EASIER.
AND I WANT TO MAKE MY NEXT
CHILD'S LIFE A LITTLE EASIER.
LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A
BY OR A GIRL, AND THAT'S BEEN
BOTHERING ME A LITTLE BIT.
LIKE I KNOW PEOPLE ARE AFTER ME,
AND I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHEN I
CAN USE THESE IDOLS BECAUSE I
GOT TO USE THEM AT THE RIGHT
TIME.
I JUST WANT VAL TO WIN.
I JUST WANT VAL TO WIN.
SHE DESERVES IT MORE THAN ME,
YOU KNOW?
MAN.
 NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH YOU
AND I AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
 OKAY.
GOOD.
 JOE IS SUPER CLOSE.
THERE'S A SISTER-BROTHER THING
HAPPENING, THERE AUNT-NEPHEW,
SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP THERE
THAT SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING, AND
I'VE BEEN NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.
 I TRUST KIMMI.
I TRUST YOU.
I TRUST KEITH.
I DON'T TRUST THE THREE GIRLS.
 NO.
 THEY HAVE A SORT OF SHARED
ARROGANCE ABOUT HOW AWESOME THEY
ARE.
I'M TIRED OF THE WAY THE GAME IS
GOING.
THERE ARE HUGE THREATS IN THIS
GAME AND EVERYONE IS TOO TIMID
TO MAKE A MOVE, BUT MY SECOND
CHANCE IS ABOUT HAVING A GAME OF
MY OWN THAT I CAN POINT TO AND
SAY, THESE ARE THE MOVES I MADE,
SO I WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING
WITH THE THREE WITCHES, BECAUSE
THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM, AND
THEY'RE DESPERATE TO MAKE A
MOVE.
 I DON'T KNOW IF WE ALL TRUST
EACH OTHER.
PROBABLY WE DON'T TRUST EACH
OTHER, NOR SHOULD WE.
I DON'T KNOW...
 OBVIOUSLY I'M STILL UP FOR
ANYTHING HONESTLY AT THIS POINT
IN THE GAME.
 I WOULD WORK WITH YOU GUYS,
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.
 IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR OWN
ASSES, WE'LL WRITE DOWN WHATEVER
YOU TELL US TO WHITE DOWN.
WHO WOULD YOUR BIG MOVE BE, JOE?
 EVERYONE WANTS JOE OUT,
RIGHT?
 EVENTUALLY.
I FEEL LIKE FOR...
 THE OTHER POWER PLAYERS
ARE...
 HE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH
EVERYONE.
HE'S NICE TO EVERYONE.
 BUT US.
 I'D GET RID OF WIGGLES.
 ABI AND KELLY WENTWORTH AND
MYSELF ARE VERY CLEARLY ON THE
BOTTOM.
BUT KELLY WEBT WORTH PULLS OUT A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, NOW PEOPLE
ARE SCRAMBLED, THEY'RE COMING TO
US AND THEY WANT TO TALK.
IT'S FUNNY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THE LAST 20
GAMES.
 IT'S A COMPLICATED GAME.
 I THINK IT'S SO DUMB THE WAY
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.
IT'S SO DUMB.
WE COULD TRULY SHIFT THE GAME.
 I'M DOWN.
 Anchor: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 Anchor:.
 Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.
JOE, I'M GOING THE TAKE IT BACK
AGAIN.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON TRIANGULAR
PLATFORMS IN THE WATER WITH YOUR
FEET PERCHED ON VERY NARROW
FOOTHOLDS AT REGULAR INTERVALS.
YOU WILL MOVE UP, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT.
IF YOU FALL, YOU ARE OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN
TEN SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY
WILL BECOME THE THIRD MEMBER OF
THE JURY.
WE'VE RUN THIS CHALLENGE BEFORE.
THE LAST TIME WE RAN IT, BRAINS,
BRAWN BEAUTY.
ONCE AGAIN SPENCER AND TASHA
PARTICIPATED.
BETH LOVES.
BIG SECOND CHANCE OPPORTUNITY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND HEAD
OUT TO THE WATER.
IT IS POURING, PROVIDING ANOTHER
OBSTACLE TO AN ALREADY DIFFICULT
CHALLENGE.
EVERYBODY GET INTO YOUR FIRST
SPOT.
HERE WE GO.
HANDS CANNOT TOUCH.
BUTT CANNOT TOUCH.
YOU FALL IN YOU'RE OUT.
I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW SECONDS HERE
TO GET YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE AN
THEN I'LL COUNT YOU IN.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
EVERYBODY SETTLED IN NICELY NOW.
THE RAIN CONTINUES TO POUR DOWN.
WE'LL STAY HERE FOR TEN MINUTES,
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE UP.
IT WILL BECOME MORE DIFFICULT.
KEITH, HOW YOU DOING?
 I WISH I HAD ABOUT A 16 SIZE
FOOT.
PROBABLY HELP A LITTLE BIT.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY LOOKING
VERY GOOD.
YOU'RE ON DAY 24 OF "SURVIVOR:
SECOND CHANCE," GREATEST
ADVENTURE GAME EVER CREATED.
IT'S A COMPLICATED GAME, AND
YOUR SUCCESS IN THIS GAME IS
TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON YOUR
ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISION AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO CHANGE YOUR SITUATION IN THIS
GAME RIGHT NOW.
BUT IT WILL REQUIRE AN INSTANT
DECISION.
FIRST PERSON TO TOUCH THEIR BUOY
EARNS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME,
BUT GIVES UP THEIR SHOT AT
IMMUNITY.
GO.
SPENCER IS IN.
TWO PEOPLE SWIMMING FOR THEIR
BUT WE.
WHO WILL TOUCH IT FIRST.
FISHBACH HAS IT.
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME FOR
FISHBACH.
SPENCER COMES UP SHORT.
THAT WAS
NOW WE PLAY IT OUT.
TEN SECONDS LEFT IN THIS FIRST
ROUND.
WE'LL MOVE UP ONE LEVEL.
HERE WE GO.
MAKE YOUR TRANSITION TO THE TOP.
THIS IS A LIVE TRANSITION.
YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS AND
YOUR BUTT, WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BUT IF YOU FALL IN, YOU ARE
STILL OUT.
I'LL COUNT YOU IN.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
WENTWORTH IS IN.
SHE CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSITION.
JEREMY STRUGGLES.
HE'S IN.
CIERA'S IN.
KIMMI'S IN.
TASHA STRUGGLING.
TASHA CAN'T DO IT.
FIVE PEOPLE COULD NOT MAKE THE
TRANSITION, AND WE'RE DOWN TO
FOUR.
KEITH, ABI, WIGLESWORTH AND JOE
ALL STILL WITH A SHOT AT
IMMUNITY.
WE'LL STAY HERE FOR 20 MINUTES.
JOE THE ONLY ONE STRUGGLING
RIGHT NOW, BUT HE'S STILL UP
THERE, AND THAT IS ALL THAT
MATTERS.
ABI LOOKS LIKES A STATUE RIGHT
NOW.
HOW YOU FEELING, ABI?
 I FEEL GREAT.
I CAN STAY HERE ALL DAY.
 Jeff: WE'RE AT THE HALF-WAY
SECTION OF THIS CHALLENGE.
THAT'S STARTING TO MAKE THE
WATER MOVE.
JOE WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
, BUT HE CONTINUES TO RECOVER.
WIGLESWORTH LOOKING LIKE A
STATUE.
ABI VERY CALM.
KEITH STARTING TO WOBBLE.
KEEP YOUR CONCENTRATION.
LOSES HIS BALANCE AND HAS NO
SHOT AT RECOVERY AND WE'RE DOWN
TO THREE.
JOE WITH MORE MOVEMENT, BUT HE'S
STILL UP THERE.
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE PRETTY ON
"SURVIVOR."
15 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.
AFTER THIS WE WILL GO TO ONE
FOOT.
ABI AS CLOSE TO INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY AS SHE'S BEEN THIS
SEASON.
THIS IS A LIVE TRANSITION.
THERE IS NO TOUCHING.
THIS IS IT.
GO TO ONE FOOT.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
WIGLESWORTH GOT TO GET IT UP.
KELLY, YOU'RE OUT.
YOU WERE TOO LATE.
KELLY TOOK TOO LONG THE MAKE THE
TRANSITION.
SHE'S OUT.
THIS IS IT.
NO TIME LIMIT NOW.
LAST PERSON LEFT UP THERE WINS
THE NECKLACE.
NICE RECOVERY BY ABI.
JOE IS THE ONLY PERSON TO WIN
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY THIS SEASON.
JOE WITH ANOTHER NICE SAVE.
ABI NOW STARTING TO WOBBLE.
 MY FOOT IS CRAMPING.
 Jeff: FATIGUE REALLY
SETTING IN.
MUSCLES STARTING TO CRAMP.
CAN SHE DO IT.
 YES, I CAN.
 Jeff: THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL
ABOUT RIGHT HERE.
IT IS POURING.
BALANCING ON ONE FOOT FOR
IMMUNITY... JOE STRUGGLING TO
STAY IN THIS.
ABI HOLDING ONE OF HER FEET,
TRYING TO RELEASE THE TENSION IN
THAT MUSCLE.
NO, ABI GOES IN.
JOE WINS HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
JOE, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: THIRD TIME IN THIS
GAME JOE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
GUARANTEED A ONE IN TEN SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.
ONE OTHER PIECE OF BUSINESS,
FISHBACH, TOOK A SHOT AT AN
ADVANTAGE, THAT IS IT.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 Jeff: IT'S YOURS TO OPEN IN
PRIVATE.
EVERYBODY ELSE, SOMEONE GOING
HOME TONIGHT.
GOOD JOB AT TRIBAL.
 IT WAS AMAZING.
JEFF PROBST GAVE ME THIS.
IT ISN'T IMMUNITY, BUT IT'S THE
NEXT BEST THING.
BUT TONIGHT, THIS IS HAPPENING,
I DON'T CARE HOW, BUT IT'S
HAPPENING.
MAYBE I BREAK UP MY ADVANTAGE.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
 GOOD JOB.
 GOOD JOB, STEPHEN.
 YEAH.
 NOBODY CAN WIN FROM JOE.
 YEAH.
 HE'S GOING TO BE WINNING
EVERY IMMUNITY FOREVER.
 JOE WON IMMUNITY, WHICH IS
FINE, BECAUSE I REALLY NEED THE
WITCH'S TO START GETTING VOTED
OUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM
GETTING TOO MUCH POWER.
 WE HAVE EIGHT VOTES.
 WE HAVE TO DO WENTWORTH FIVE,
CIERA THREE AND LET THE THREE
WITCHES THIS WHATEVER THE HECK
THEY WANT TO DO.
 TRIBAL COUNCIL COMING UP, AND
SOME OF THE LARGER ALLIANCE ARE
PLOTTING TO VOTE OUT WENTWORTH
OR CIERA, BUT WE'RE GOING TO
SPLIT VOTES.
 WE REALLY WANT WENTWORTH TO
GO HOME.
 WE'LL JUST DO GUYS.
 HOW MANY GUYS DO WE HAVE?
 FIVE.
 FIVE GUYS AND THREE GIRLS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 RIGHT NOW WE WANT WENTWORTH
TO GO HOME.
SHE'S REALLY SAVVY.
SHE'S ALREADY PLAYED AN IDOL.
SHE'S BUILDING HER RESUME, AND
SHE NEEDS TO GO.
 I WON THIS MYSTERY ADVANTAGE
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE TODAY.
 YOUR SWIFT DECISIONS GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO STEAL A LOOK AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 THIS IS TREMENDOUS.
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER.
THIS IS AMAZING.
THIS IS LIKE... THIS IS BEYOND
MY WILDEST DREAMS.
 WAIT UNTIL IT IS YOUR TURN
THE VOTE, AND ANNOUNCE TO JEFF
YOU WISH TO USE YOUR ADVANTAGE.
YOU WILL THEN SELECT ONE TRIBE
MEMBER WHOSE VOTE YOU WILL
STEAL.
THIS PERSON WILL NOT CAST A VOTE
AND INSTEAD YOU WILL CAST A
SECOND VOTE.
IN SURVIVOR NO COLLAR, BLUE
COLLAR, WHITE COLLAR, DAN WON
THE RIGHT TO CAST ANOTHER VOTE,
BUT BALANCING ABLE TO STEAL
SOMEONE'S VOTE CAN SHIFT THE
ENTIRE POWER DYNAMIC OF THE
GAME.
WOW, I AM IN AN INSANELY
POWERFUL POSITION, UNLESS I
SCREW IT UP, BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO USE IT TONIGHT.
I KNOW THAT I'M SAFE.
THAT WOULD BE A WASTE TONIGHT.
TONIGHT I CAN FIX WITH MY WITS
AND HUSTLE, BUT THIS IS LIKE A
GAME-WINNING ADVANTAGE.
 WIGLESWORTH, ARE YOU INTO
THIS?
 I JUST THINK SOMEONE ELSE
WOULD DO IT.
 I CAN DEFINITELY DO IT.
I NEED ONE OTHER PERSON.
 YEAH, I'M TOTALLY DOWN WITH
IT.
 I FEEL LIKE IF THIS BLINDSIDE
TONIGHT WORKS AND WIGLESWORTH
GOES HOME, THERE ARE NEW PEOPLE
WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME,
SO I FEEL LIKE MUCH MORE
CONFIDENT GOING FORWARD IN THIS
GAME.
IF IT WORKS.
I JUST HOPE I DON'T GO HOME
TONIGHT.
 SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
 THE THREE OF US VOTE
WIGLESWORTH.
SHE'S GONE.
LET ME JUST TALK THROUGH LIKE
HOW THAT WOULD WORK IF THAT
HAPPENED.
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?
 WELL, FIRST OF ALL IT LEAVES
US WITH SIX WITH THE GIRLS.
IT LEAVES US IN A GREAT
POSITION.
LIKE WE CAN'T KEEP PLAYING FROM
THE BOTTOM LIKE THIS.
LET'S SHIFT THE GAME.
TAKING OUT WIGLESWORTH SHIFTS
THE WHOLE GAME.
 YES, RIGHT HERE WITH THREE OF
US, THAT'S AN 11-PERSON TRIBE.
 I DON'T WANT TO MAKE AN
ALLIANCE WITH A PEOPLE ON THE
BOTTOM AND GET PICKED OFF.
I WANT TO BUILD A VOTING BLOC.
EVERY TRIBAL.
 I WOULD BE STOKED IF
WIGLESWORTH WERE REMOVED FROM
THE GAME RIGHT NOW, BUT TO...
BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING THE WAY
WE MAKE IT HAPPEN IS TRUST THREE
PEOPLE THAT WE CAN'T TRUST.
 UH-HUH.
 WOULD I LOVE TO TAKE CONTROL
OF THE GAME?
YES.
CAN I MAKE IT HAPPEN IN A WAY
THAT DOESN'TRY TO MY -- THAT
DOESN'T DESTROY MY GAME?
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE CONFUSED
ABOUT ANY ECONOMICS, STATISTICS
PROBLEM THAN I AM THIS ONE.
 HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT
ABI AND WENTWORTH WANT
WIGLESWORTH GONE?
YOU SURE THEY'RE DOWN?
 YES.
 WE'RE ALL SET WITH TAKING OUT
ONE OF THREE WITCHES.
I'M HESITANT WITH STEPHEN.
STEPHEN'S RUNNING AROUND.
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO PLAY THEIR
OWN GAME.
I WANT EVERYONE TO BE ON THE
SAME PAGE.
THE PERSON I TRUST MOST IS
STEPHEN.
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO TRUST THREE
GIRLS THAT WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME.
 I'M ASKING YOU TO TRUST THE
GIRLS, THEIR MOMENTARILY... IT'S
A GAME OF VOTING BLOCS.
IT'S NOT A GAME OF LONG-TERM
ALLIANCES.
 I'M TRYING TO WILL BE DOWN MY
ALLIANCE AND TRYING TO WORK
THESE OTHER VOTING BLOCS.
 WIGLESWORTH.
 YEP, SURE DOES.
 IF WE TAKE WIGLESWORTH AWAY,
THERE WILL BE FOUR PEOPLE THAT
WILL COME BACK TO CAMP
BLINDSIDED, KIMMI, TASHA, KEITH,
JOE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO WORRY.
AND I WANT THE MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISION AND THE RIGHT MOVE.
I DON'T WANT TO JUST JUMP SHIP
AND DO IT SO FAST.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
KASS AND SAVAGE VOTED OUT IN THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
FISHBACH, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
FREEZING.
 I AM FREEZING.
IT'S REALLY COLD.
IT'S HARD TO EVEN THINK STRAIGHT
TODAY.
 Jeff: KEITH, THIS IS PART
OF THE GAME YOU SORT OF WANT
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT SO BIG, AND
YET IT REALLY TAKES A TOLL ON
YOU.
 IT DOES, JEFF.
I'M GOING ON TWO HOURS OF SLEEP
OVER THE LAST 36 HOURS.
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY FOOD.
IT'S HARD TO CONCENTRATE RIGHT
NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT THINKING
STRAIGHT.
 Anchor: YEAH, IT'S REAL.
 WE KNOW.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU
RECEIVED THE MAJORITY OF THE
VOTES AT YOUR LAST TRIBAL.
IF NOT FOR THE VOTES, YOU WOULD
BE SITTING OVER THERE AND SAVAGE
WOULD BE HERE.
 I'M HOPING ME PLAYING THE
IDOL OPENED PEOPLE'S EYES AND
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO MAKE A
MOVE AT TRIBAL.
 Jeff: CIERA, IF THE GAME IS
AS FLUID AS IT APPEARS TO BE,
BEING ON THE BOTTOM OF ONE
TRIBAL MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
THE NEXT TRIBAL.
 ABSOLUTELY.
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
AND WE SAW KELLEY THROW OUT AN
IDOL.
NOW I THINK IT SCARED PEOPLE A
LITTLE BIT.
AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH MY OR GET
PLAYED AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW?
 Jeff: JOE, BIG STATEMENT:
PLAY OR GET PLAYED.
 YEAH.
IF YOU THINK SOMEONE IS COMING
AFTER YOU, IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU
GOT TO GO GET 'EM FIRST, LIKE
CIERA IS SAYING, GET OR GET GOT.
 Jeff: JEREMY, FOR ALL THE
TALK ABOUT FLUIDITY, LAST VOTE
NINE PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER.
 WITH NINE PEOPLE, THAT'S A
HUGE ALLIANCE, AND I THINK EVEN
MORE THAN THAT, THIS GAME IS
ABOUT VOTING BLOCS.
A FEW PEOPLE ARE IN ONE VOTING
BLOC.
A FEW ARE IN ANOTHER.
I'M STICKING TRYING TO FIGURE IT
OUT MYSELF.
 Jeff: SPENCER, DO YOU AGREE
WITH JEREMY'S ASSESSMENT, THERE
ARE FACTIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING
TOGETHER, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT
WILL LAST.
 YEAH, I DO.
 HOWEVER, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DON'T BUILD TRUST, AND THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT TRUST DOESN'T
JUST DISAPPEAR WHEN YOU DO VOTE.
 Jeff: WIGLESWORTH, SPENCER
JUST SAID IT IT REALLY CLEARLY,
THE VOLT ULTIMATELY TELLS THE
TRUTH.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: WHAT DO YOU HOPE
HAPPENS TONIGHT?
 I HOPE EVERYBODY DOES WHAT
THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
 Jeff: HOW CONFIDENT ARE
YOU?
 I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT.
 Jeff: FISHBACH, DO YOU
THINK WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN
EVOLUTION OF THE GAME?
BECAUSE NOBODY HAS EVER TALKED
ABOUT THIS TYPE OF STRATEGY.
 I ABSOLUTELY THINK THE GAME
IS EVOLVING.
ALLIANCE AREN'T CLEAR-CUT AND
DEFINED.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR WORD TO
PEOPLE, AND SOMETIMES YOU MAY
NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE.
AND SOMETIMES THEY MAY NEED TO
BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOU.
 STILL, JEFF, EVEN WITH THE
VOTING BLOC, YOU NEED THOSE TWO
OR THREE PEOPLE YOU TRUST
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THE VOTING BLOC WITH THE
STRONGEST ALLIANCE WILL DOMINATE
THIS GAME.
 Jeff: WHO HERE IS TRULY
WORRIED RIGHT NOW, HEARTBEATING,
THAT IT MIGHT BE THEM TONIGHT.
SO ABI, TASHA, FISHBACH,
SPENCER, WENTWORTH, CIERA.
SPENCER, HALF THE GROUP IS TRULY
CONCERNED.
 YEAH, AND HALF THE GROUP IS
BOLD ENOUGH TO ADMIT THAT IN
FRONT OF THEIR ALLIES AND IN
FRONT OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM
THEY HAVE TRUST.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TO GO HOME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ABI, YOU'RE UP.
 I'M VOTING FOR YOU BECAUSE
IT'S PART OF THE PLAN.
I HOPE IT WORKS.
 SORRY, GIRL.
 THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE
KELLY ON THIS ISLAND.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE CIERA.
WENTWORTH.
WIGLESWORTH.
CIERA.
WENTWORTH.
WIGLESWORTH.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES WIGLESWORTH, TWO VOTES
CIERA, TWO VOTES WENTWORTH.
THAT'S THREE VOTES CIERA.
WIGLESWORTH.
THAT'S THREE VOTES WIGLESWORTH.
WIGLESWORTH.
FOUR VOTES WIGLESWORTH, THREE
VOTES CIERA, TWO VOTES
WENTWORTH.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
WIGLESWORTH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
KELLY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
WELL, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL WOULD
SEEM TO CONFIRM THAT AN
EVOLUTION IS HAPPENING IN THE
GAME PLAY OF "SURVIVOR."
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHERE IT
GOES.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
TRY TO GET WARM.
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THE RAIN IS
RELENTLESS.
 PEOPLE ASK ME IF "SURVIVOR"
IS FUN, "SURVIVOR" AIN'T FUN.
GOING ON A CRUISE IS FUN.
 Jeff: AND FORCES A DECISION
THAT COULD CHANGE THE GAME.
MAKE YOUR DECISION.
PUT YOU PALM OUT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL.
 I DIDN'T HOPE TO GO OUT THIS
EARLY.
I KNOW I WAS VOTED OUT BECAUSE
I'M A THREAT.
I MEAN, I FIGURED THE THREE
GIRLS WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME.
IT'S THE TWO OTHER VOTES THAT I
KIND OF SUSPECT.
I HOPE IT WASN'T JOE.
IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT GAME THIS
TIME THAN IT WAS THE LAST TIME.
IT'S NOT REALLY MY STYLE.
SO THEY CAN HAVE AT IT.
