 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," IN A SEASON OF
SECOND CHANCES, EVERYONE WAS
TRYING TO CHANGE THEIR HISTORY
IN THE GAME.
 I JUST WANT TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT I DIDN'T DO THE FIRST TIME.
GO BIG OR GO HOME.
 I'M ACTUALLY MAKING
RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE SAVED
ME.








 I'VE BEEN KICKING MYSELF FOR
NOT GETTING RID OF THE GOLDEN
BOY LAST TIME.
 Jeff: AT THE MERGE,
EVERYONE WAS BATTLING FOR
NUMBERS.
 LET ME TELL YOU WHO IS ON THE
LIST AND YOU TOLL ME IF YOU
THINK THEY'RE IN.
 YOU HAVE TO HIT THE GROUND
RUNNING TO BE IN THE MAJORITY.
 BUT FOR JOE, THE NUMBER-ONE
PRIORITY WAS WINNING.
JOE WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL








IMMUNITY.
BACK AT CAMP, KASS WAS IN
TROUBLE AND LOOKING TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, CIERA WAS ON
BOARD.
 WE'RE SECOND-TIME PLAYERS,
PLAY TO WIN.
 Jeff: BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS
READY TO PULL THE TRIGGER.
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY --
LEAVING CIERA, ABI AND WENTWORTH
ON THE BOTTOM -- KASS, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
12 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 BRILLIANT PLAN EXECUTED TO
PERFECTION.
 YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.
 LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
UNBELIEVABLE.
MY FIRST GOAL OF "SURVIVOR" WAS
TO MAKE THE JURY.
I'M LIKE, WOW, I DID IT.
IT'S NOT OFTEN IN LIFE THAT YOU
HAVE THESE REALLY HUGE, HUNKING
DREAMS THAT YOU CARRY FOR YEARS
AND YEARS, AND THEN SUDDENLY IT
HAPPENS.
NOW IT'S DAY 20.
MY JOB IS TO KEEP MY ALLIANCE
SOLID, KIND OF OLE SCHOOL AND
JUST STAY THE COURSE, PICK OFF
THE CIERAS AND ABIS AND
WENTWORTHS.
I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT CIERA.
 I PLAY THE GAME WITH THE
GUYS.
YOU, ME AND JOE.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE A
MOVE AT SOME POINT.
WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHEN THAT IS.
 I KNOW THEY'RE PLANNING A BIG
MOVE.
I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES.
AND THE TRICK IS TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OUT
AND TRY TO OFFSET IT AS BEST WE
CAN.
IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY
TODAY.
 YEAH, IT IS.
 HOW YOU FEELING AFTER LAST
NIGHT?
 OKAY.
LIKE I EXPECTED I'D GET SOME
VOTES, BUT, I MEAN, THIS GAME IS
ALWAYS CHANGING.
AT THIS POINT I'M ON THE BOTTOM
OF THIS TOTEM POLE, SO I'M GOING
TO BE THROWING ANYTHING I CAN
THROW AND TRYING TO GET SOMEBODY
TO, YOU KNOW, CATCH ON TO IT.
YOU GUYS HAVE THE NUMBERS, SO
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN... MY HANDS
ARE SOMEWHAT TIED.
I THINK STEPHEN WANTS TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE.
I JUST THINK HE'S WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME.
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT CONVINCING
STEVEN THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT
TIME.
 OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO
FRACTURE AT SOME POINT.
I WANT TO START SETTING THINGS
UP NOW THAT WILL PAY OFF LATER.
 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THIS
THEN: IF IT WERE UP TO ME, I
WOULD MAKE A MOVE AGAINST JOE IF
HE LOST.
 SIERRA'S CLEARLY IN A BAD
POSITION, BUT WE HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON.
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO MAKE A MOVE
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TO GET
OURSELVESES INTO A WINNING
POSITION.
WE DON'T NEED EVERYBODY.
YOU JUST NEED SIX AT THIS POINT.
 SIX, YEAH.
 CIERA WANTS TO FLIP THE GAME
ON ITS HEAD.
I DO, TOO.
I DON'T WANT TO BE RUN OVER.
IT'S TIME TO GO FOR SOMEONE WHO
IS A REAL THREAT TO WIN THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
WE'RE GOING TO DIVIDE UP INTO
TWO TEAMS OF SIX.
ON MY GO YOU'RE GOING TO PADDLE
OUT TO A SERIES OF CRATES.
YOU'LL JUMP IN, UNTIE THE CRATE,
GET IN YOUR BOAT AND CONTINUE
ON.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR CRATES,
YOU WILL STACK THEM SO THAT
THERE ARE NO REPEATING COLORS ON
ANY SIDE.
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: THE WINNING SIX WILL
BE TAKEN TO THE "SURVIVOR" CAFÉE
WHERE YOU WILL START WITH ICED
COFFEE, BAGELS AND CREAM CHEESE,
COOKIES.
YOU'RE GOING TO O.D. ON CAFFEINE
AND SUGAR AND RETURN TO CAMP
HOPPING AROUND LIKE LITTLE
BUNNIES.
FIRST TIME WE DID A PADDLING
CHALLENGE WAS IN SEASON ONE WHEN
KELLY WIGLESWORTH, THE RIVER
RAFTING GUY, THE WOMAN WHO MAKES
HER LIVING PADDLING, LOST TO
GERVASE 15 YEARS AGO.
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER THAT
MOMENT?
 YEAH, HE COULDN'T SWIM, BY
THE WAY.
I'M HELPING YOU OUT.
 Jeff: THE TAI SHEN KUO WAS,
"I LOST TO THE GUY WHO CAN'T
SWIM."
SO BIG SECOND-CHANCE OPPORTUNITY
FOR WIGLESWORTH.
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK AND WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
OUR SCHOOLYARD PICK HAS GIVEN US
TWO TEAMS.
WENTWORTH, KIMMI, WIGLESWORTH,
JOE, CIERA, AND KEITH TAKING ON
TASHA, SAVAGE, SPENCER, JEREMY,
FISHBACH AND ABI.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
GOT TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE
BOAT.
THEN YOU START PADDLING.
 ONE, TWO, THREE, GO!
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO
PADDLE STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
 PADDLE.
 Jeff: JOE AND KEITH HAVING
TROUBLE.
 WATCH YOURSELF.
WATCH YOURSELF.
 WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN
WIGLESWORTH'S TEAM IN TROUBLE
WITH THE PADDLING.
YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY OUT
AROUND YOUR FLAG.
THEN YOU START COLLECTING
PLATES.
SHE GOT HER TEAM BACK ON TRACK
AND WE'RE AT THE TURN DEAD EVEN.
NOW THEY'RE GOING TO RUN INTO
EACH OTHER, AND YOU'VE GOT TO
CRISSCROSS TO GET TO YOUR FIRST
CRATE.
JOE HAS PUSHED THE OTHER TEAM
WAY OFF COURSE.
 BECOMEWARDS, GUYS, BACKWARD.
 Jeff: KEITH IN THE WATER
FOR THE GLEN TEAM.
 YOU GOT IT, KEITH.
 Jeff: ABI NOW IN THE WATER
FOR HER TEAM.
KEITH HAS FIRST BOX UNTIED.
ABI STILL WORKING ON THAT FIRST
CRATE.
 LEFT.
 OUCH.
 Jeff: IT IS JOE, CIERA,
WIGLESWORTH, WENTWORTH, KIMMI
AND KEITH IN THE LEAD.
KEITH BACK IN THE WATER.
 GRAB THAT.
 Jeff: ABI FINALLY HAS THE
KNOTS UNDONE.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.
 Jeff: JOE TRYING TO PULL IN
THAT SECOND BOX.
THEY ARE HEAVY.
HERE COMES THE PURPLE TEAM.
 I CAN DO IT.
 Jeff: HERE COMES SPENCER
WITH A SECOND CRATE FOR HIS
TEAM.
HE'S REPLACED ABI.
BIG LEAD RIGHT NOW FOR GREEN.
WIGLESWORTH'S TRIBE HAS TWO
CRATES.
SPENCER HAS THE SECOND CRATE FOR
HIS TEAM.
PURPLE IS FIGHTING TO CATCH UP.
AND A DISASTER AS SPENCER FALLS
IN.
GOT TO GET BACK IN THE BOAT.
 GO, GO.
 Jeff: KEITH UNTYING THAT
THIRD CRATE FOR HIS TEAM.
JOE AND KEITH WORKING TOGETHER
VERY WELL ON THESE CRATES.
 THEY ABOY, KEITH.
 Jeff: GREEN WITH A
ONE-FULL-CRATE LEAD.
SPENCER BACK IN THE WATER
LOOKING FOR THAT THIRD CRATE.
 GET IT, JOE.
GET IT, JOE.
 Jeff: JOE GOING TO GO IN
THE WATER THIS TIME FOR THAT
FOURTH AND FINAL CRATE.
 I'M ON THE GROUND.
I'M ON THE GROUND.
 Jeff: WHEN IT GETS SHALLOW
YOU CAN PUSH IT.
 KEEP IT STEADY.
 Jeff: SPENCER STILL WORKING
THE KNOT FOR THE THIRD CRATE FOR
HIS TEAM.
AS HE DOES, HIS TEAM DRIFTS
FURTHER AWAY FROM HIM, FORCING
SPENCER TO SWIM TO THE BOAT.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCE.
 Jeff: JOE HAS THE FOURTH
CRATE.
THEY'RE HEADING TO THE BEACH.
 COME ON, GUYS.
 Jeff: BIG TIME ADVANTAGE.
 KEITH, YOU GOT ONE?
 I DON'T KNOW.
CAN I GET IT?
 KIMMI, YOU GOT IT?
 GO!
COME ON, LET'S GO!
 Jeff: EVERYBODY WORKING
TOGETHER WITH THOSE CRATES.
JOE TAKING ONE ALONE.
THAT IS HOW YOU GET IT DONE ON
"SURVIVOR."
THEY'LL HAVE A BIG LEAD IF THEY
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.
SPENCER BACK IN THE WATER.
THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME TO
MAKE UP.
 SORRY.
 YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.
 Jeff: PURPLE FINALLY HAS
THAT FOURTH CRATE.
SPENCER'S GOT TO GET ON THE
BOAT.
LET'S GO!
KEITH, JOE, WIGLESWORTH, KIMMI,
CIERA AND WENTWORTH HAVE ALL
THEIR CRATES.
START STACKING.
LET'S GO!
YOU GOT TO GET THEM UP THE
BEACH.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF
TEAMWORK TO MAKE UP THIS TIME
LOSS.
THE CRATES ARE HARD TO LIFT.
GET THEM IN THE STRUCTURE.
JEREMY HEAVING ONE ON HIS
SHOULDER.
HE'S DOING THE WORK OF TWO
PEOPLE.
GOT NO GET ALL FOUR CRATES IN
THE SPOT BEFORE YOU START
WORKING THE PUZZLE.
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NO
REPEATING COLORS ON ANY SIDE.
YOU SEE THE SAME COLOR, IT'S NOT
RIGHT.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
 THAT ONE'S WRONG.
THAT HAS TO BE SWITCHED.
 Jeff: A LOT OF TEAMWORK
FROM PURPLE RIGHT NOW AND A LOT
OF PROGRESS QUICKLY.
THEY'RE BACK IN IT.
WE'RE VERY CLOSE AGAIN.
EVERYBODY NOW WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLE.
 TURN IT, TURN IT.
 Jeff: ALL YOU'RE LOOKING TO
DO IS HAVE NO REPEATING COLORS.
 I GOT YELLOW, GREEN, GREEN,
RED.
 THE OTHER WAY, SAVAGE.
YES!
ONE MORE.
YES!
 Jeff: WHEN YOU THINK YOU
HAVE IT, LET ME KNOW.
 WE'VE GOT IT, JEFF.
 Jeff: NO, NO, YOU HAVE
REPEATING RED.
 OH, ALMOST.
 KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, GUYS.
 Jeff: FISHBACH THOUGHT HE
HAD IT.
HE'S WRONG.
GOT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
 SORRY.
 GREEN ON YOUR SIDE.
 I GOT GREEN HERE.
 THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT!
 YES.

 WE GOT IT!
 Jeff: REWARD FOR KIMMI,
CIERA, WENTWORTH, WIGLESWORTH
AND JOE.
HUGE VICTORY.
WIGLESWORTH, PART OF THE IDEA OF
THIS SECOND-CHANCE SEASON IS TO
RID YOURSELF OF THOSE THINGS
THAT HAVE HAUNTED YOU.
DOES THIS RID THAT MEMORY OF
LOSING TO GERVASE 15 YEARS AGO?
 YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.
IT FEELS AWESOME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
NICE REWARD.
YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO THE SURVIVOR
CAFEÉ, COFFEE, SANDWICH,
DESSERTS.
SHOULD BE A NICE BREAK, AND GIVE
THEREIN ARE STILL SO MANY PEOPLE
LEFT IN THIS GAME, WHO KNOWS
WHAT IT WILL DO TO THE STRATEGY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD OUT.
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: SPENCER, AB, A
FISHBACH, TASHBACK JEREMY,
SAVAGE, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 THE THOUGHT OF JOE AND THE
GIRLS BEING ABLE TO WORK
TOGETHER IS TERRIFYING.
BUT THIS GIVES HIM A CHANCE TO
GET INTO THEIR HEAD, AND THAT
COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.
 OH, MY GOSH, YOU GUYS.
GETTING TO THE REWARD, THEY
DROVE US IN ON THIS LITTLE, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CALLED.
THEY'RE LIKE BIKE THINGS.
AND WE WALK IN THIS COOL LITTLE
CAFEÉ.
 ENJOY.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I WAS SO SUPER EXCITED.
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME EVER GOING
ON A REWARD WITH FOOD EITHER
SEASON.
SO IT WAS SO SUPER SPECIAL FOR
ME.
IT WAS NICE TO GET A LITTLE
GLIMPSE OF WHAT LIFE IS LIKE
OUTSIDE THE GAME FOR JUST A
LITTLE WHILE.
 WOW.
 THIS IS AMAZING.
 THIS IS SUPER FUN.
 EVERYBODY HAD SUCH GOOD
TEAMWORK.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE LACKING
OVER THERE I THINK.
 REWARDS ARE EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT.
IT GIVES YOU PERFECT TIME TO
TALK TRACT.
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A SECOND TO
RELAX, THEY CAN MAYBE SEE THE
LIGHT OF DAY, SO I REALLY LOOK
AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN
PLANT A FEW MORE SEEDS AND BUILD
A FEW MORE RELATIONSHIPS.
 WHAT I WAS SAYING LAST NIGHT
ABOUT PLAYING, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
TO OFFEND ANYBODY.
I'M JUST SAYING ON MY FIRST
SEASON, THERE WAS A TIGHT GROUP,
AND I WAS IN THAT GROUP.
I THOUGHT EVENTUALLY I'D BE ABLE
TO MAKE A MOVE, BUT THEN ALL MY
NUMBERS WERE GONE.
AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO LOSE.
SO I'M FISHING.
I'M JUST LETTING THAT LINE OUT
AND WAITING FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE
THE BAIT HOPING THAT SOMEBODY
OUT THERE WANTS TO PLAY THE SAME
GAME I'M PLAYING.
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS
JEREMY, TASH, YEAH STEPHEN AND
SAVAGE, THEY'RE NOT BREAKING UP.
 I'M WITH BAYON.
THEY KNOW I'M RIDING WITH THEM,
BUT CIERA IS RIGHT.
I KNOW THAT THEY'RE TIGHT.
I KNOW THEY DON'T WANT ME WITH
THEM AT SOME POINT.
 JEREMY IS SMART AND STEPHEN
IS SMART.
 STEPHEN WILL TRY MAKE A MOVE.
 YES, HE WILL.
HE KNOWS NUMBERS.
HE KNOWS THIS GAME.
TRUST ME.
 PEOPLE WILL ONLY BE LOYAL SO
LONG, AND I MYSELF AM ONLY GOING
TO BE LOYAL SO LONG.
SO IT'S JUST MATTER OF MAKING
SURE I MAKE A MOVE AT THE RIGHT
TEAM WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
 WHAT ARE THEM THINGS CALLED,
RICKSHAW... NO.
LET ME GO OUT HERE AND JUST
LOOK.
I USED TO HAVE A TRAIL 70.
DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET IT
CRANKED.
I THINK I'M IN GEAR.
 DON'T BREAK IT.
[ENGINE REVS]
[CHEERING]
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE KEITH IN
TEN YEARS RETIRED ON THE BEACH,
AND THIS IS WHAT HE'S GOING TO
BE DOING.
 I NEED SOME PASSENGERS.
WE DON'T HAVE NO BEACH IN
LOUISIANA THAT YOU CAN ROLL UP
ON TO, SO THIS IS A
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME DEAL.
HERE I AM DRIVING THE UK-TUK ON
THE BEACH IN CAMBODIA WITH MY
WASDY, HAULING THEM AROUND LIKE
A TAXI DRIVER.
 LET'S SEE IF THIS BABY IS
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.
 I OUGHT TO GET MY CAMBODIA
DRIVER'S LICENSE.
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING SLICK.
YOU CALL, WE'LL HAUL.
CALL ME UP AND I'LL COME GET
YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
 I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
I'M HAVING A REAL LOW MOMENT.
 GET OVER IT.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TAKING
IT SO HARD.
I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING...
 DEBBIE DOWNER.
 TYPICALLY ON "SURVIVOR" I
ALWAYS TELL MYSELF, THE REWARD
DOESN'T MATTER, BUT FOR SOME
REASON THIS LOSS TODAY, THIS
LOSS OF FOOD, THIS LOSS OF A
CHANCE TO BOND, THIS LOSS OF
ENERGY FOR LATER IN THE GAME
JUST REALLY SET ME OFF.
THE REWARD HELPS AND IT FEELS
GREAT AND THEN IT'S OVER.
 I ALSO LOST... SOME OF THE
BONDS MADE ON THE REWARD NEVER
RECOVERED.
 YOU THINK THEY'RE BONDING
OVER THERE?
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
IT HAPPENS IN GENERAL OR HOW
MUCH... WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
 THE PEOPLE I NEED TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE, THEY'RE OFF ON THEIR
REWARD BONDING WITH JOE.
JOE'S THE ENEMY.
THAT COULD BE TERRIBLE FOR ME.
THAT'S MY NIGHTMARE.
SO I SEE IT PULLED OUT OF MY
GRASP AGAIN BECAUSE OF SOME
STUPID FOOD REWARD CHALLENGE.
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING I DON'T
WANT TO SPEND DAYS GETTING RID
OF THE CIERAS AND ABIS OF THE
WORLD WHEN THERE ARE REAL
THREATS IN THE GAME.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
 I WAS THINKING IF JOE LOSES
IT COULD BE A CHANCE TO GET JOE
OUT.
 SINCE DAY ONE STEPHEN HAS
BEEN TRYING TO GET JOE OUT AN I
WAS RELUCTANT BECAUSE I VIEW JOE
AS A SHIELD.
BUT EVERY TIME JOE WINS, IT JUST
KEEPS GETTING THAT BULL'S-EYE
BIGGER AND BIGGER ON HIS BACK.
SO THE FIRST TIME JOE LOSES, HE
COULD BE GOING HOME.
 I DON'T WANT US TO BE TRYING
TO PULL TOGETHER A PLAN.
I'M DOWN FOR IT.
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE THE
GUY PULLED UNTIL THE END.
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO GET TO THE
FRONT SEAT AND DRIVE.
I WAS THINKING IF JOE LOST, I
COULD GET TO VOTES TO BLINDSIDE
HIM THIS COMING TRIBAL COUNCIL.
THIS IS THE MERGE ON THE
"SURVIVOR" ALL-STAR SEASON TO
STAR TARGETING PHYSICAL THREATS.
I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE
BLINDSIDE INCREASES.
 THAT'S MY THOUGHT, TOO.
HE'LL NEVER SEE IT NOW.
I'M WILLING THE PLAY BALL.
 STEPHEN WANTS JOE OUT.
HE'S DOING WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO
TO GET IT DONE.
ANY TIME YOU GO INTO AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, WHATEVER IT IS, JOE
IS A GOOD BET TO WIN.
YOU'D BE CRAZY NOT TO VOTE HIM
OUT THE SECOND YOU GET THE
CHANCE.
 I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
WITH YOU.
I HAVE A FEW THINGS ON MY MIND.
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING, IF JOE
LOSES, WE THINK ABOUT VOTING
HIM.
 IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
 WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO DO IT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE A BLIND SIDE.
 TODAY I HEARD STEPHEN TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER A BLINDSIDE OF
JOE.
THE SCHEMING, LYING, DECEIT IT'S
DISGUSTING.
I HAVE A GREAT ALLIANCE WITH
JOE.
I LOVE THE GUY, SO HE'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.
IF I HAVE TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH
STEVEN, BRING IT ON.
 GOOD MORNING.
 RISE AND SHINE.
 WHAT'S UP, DUDE?
 GOT A MINUTE?
 YEAH.
 WE GOT A PROBLEM.
STEPHEN IS DIABOLICAL.
HE KEEPS THROWING YOUR NAME OUT.
HE'S SAYING, JOE, JOE, JOE, JOE.
HE'S GOING TO MAKE A HUGE MOVE
VERY SOON.
 THIS MORNING SAVAGE TOLD ME
THAT STEPHEN IS GUNNING FOR ME.
NO SURPRISE.
HE'S A SMART GUY.
AND I KNOW I'M A THREAT.
SO I KNEW THIS WAS COMING.
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT SO SOON.
 I NEED YOU THE LOOK ME IN THE
EYE, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
ON MY KIDS' LIFE I WILL NEVER
WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN.
 AT THIS POINT I TRUST SAVAGE.
I FEEL LIKE HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR
MY BEST INTERESTS, BUT IF
STEPHEN HAS RALLIED THE NUMBERS
TO VOTE ME OUT, IF I DON'T WIN
IMMUNITY, I'M GONE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
JOE.
GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.
 ALL RIGHT.
BUDDY.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
WITNESS AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK
UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE A BALL ON A
DISK ATTACHED TO A ROPE.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU WILL
MOVE YOUR HANDS FURTHER DOWN THE
ROPE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO
BALANCE.
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS,
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE,
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH
PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
THIS CHALLENGE HAS RUN ONE TIME.
KEITH AND JEREMY PARTICIPATED.
JEREMY, YOU WERE...
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: FIRST OUT.
AND KEITH WON.
SO BIG SECOND-CHANCE STORY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS IN FIRST POSITION,
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Anchor: AND SECONDS IN
WENTWORTH IS OUT FOLLOWED RIGHT
BEHIND BY CIERA.
THAT'S HOW FAST YOUR FATE IN
THIS GAME CAN CHANGE.
YOU HAVE TO BE ON AT ALL TIMES.
AND KELLY WIGLESWORTH DROPS.
JEREMY CANNOT RECOVER.
JEREMY IS OUT.
THIS CHALLENGE IS MOVING
QUICKLY.
KIMMI'S BALL ON THE MOVE.
CAN SHE SAVE IT?
YES.
NICE JOB.
ABI STARTS TO ROLL.
ABI CANNOT RECOVER.
ABI IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO SEVEN.
FISHBACH DROPS.
FISHBACH IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.
KIMMI'S BALL CONTINUING TO MOVE.
NO SOONER SAID, SAVAGE'S BALL ON
THE MOVE OUT OF NOWHERE.
SAVAGE CAN'T CONTROL IT.
SAVAGE IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.
WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.
KEITH, JOE, SPENCER, TASHA, AND
KIMMI.
WE'LL GO TEN MINUTES IN THIS
FIRST ROUND.
THEN WE WILL MOVE FURTHER BACK
ON THE ROPE, AND IT WILL GET
MORE DIFFICULT.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY HAS PROVED INTO THE
SECOND POSITION.
YOUR HANDS ARE NOW FURTHER
BECOME ON THE ROPE, WHICH IS
GOING THE MAKE THIS MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT.
WE WILL STAY HERE FOR TEN
MANSLAUGHTER BEFORE WE MOVE EVEN
FURTHER BACK.
KIMMI RIGHT ON THE EDGE, AND
ANOTHER NICE SAVE AND ANOTHER
ONE.
KIMMI STAYING IN THIS CHALLENGE
AND STILL PULLING IT OFF.
THE LUCK RUNS OUT.
KIMMI DROPS OUT.
AN WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
TASHA DROPS.
SHE IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.
THREE MEN, KEITH, JOE AND
SPENCER.
KEITH WON IT THE FIRST TIME WE
DID IT.
WOULD LOVE TO REPEAT.
JOE AND SPENCER WOULD LIKE THE
THE -- TO STEAL IT.
ALL THREE GUYS, KEEP DOING WHAT
YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE IT'S
WORKING.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION.
HANDS BACK AT THE FURTHEST PART
OF THE ROPE.
THIS IS THE FURTHEST YOU CAN GO.
KEITH LOOKING TO RETAIN THE
TITLE.
JOE AND SPENCER LOOKING TO KNOCK
HIM DOWN.
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN
HAVING THAT NECKLACE AROUND YOUR
NECK WHEN YOU COME INTO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
KEITH WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT, BUT A NICE RECOVERY.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT BY JOE.
SPENCER IS OUT.
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.
IT IS KEITH VERSUS JOE FOR
IMMUNITY.
WE WILL STAY IN THIS SECTION FOR
TEN MORE MINUTES, AND IF YOU
SURVIVE THIS, WE WILL ADD A
SECOND BALL.
KEITH AND JOE BOTH HAVE TWO
BALLS ON THEIR DISC.
NO TIME LIMIT IN THIS ROUND.
WE JUST GO UNTIL IT'S OVER.
KEITH NOW WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT.
ONE BALL WAS TOUGH, TWO IS
DEFINITELY MORE THAN TWICE AS
HARD.
THOSE BALLS START TO GO IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, YOU'RE IN
TROUBLE.
YOU CAN'T AFFORD ANY MOVEMENT.
KEITH WON IT AT THIS SAME STAGE
THE FIRST TIME WE DID IT IN
BLOOD VERSUS WATER.
JOE'S BALLS START TO MOVE.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT BY
KEITH.
A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE.
JOE'S BALLS MOVE A LITTLE MORE.
THE WIND STARTING TO PICK UP NOW
CAUSING JOE'S BALLS TO MOVE.
ONCE AGAIN HE SETTLES BACK IN.
KEITH SOLID.
YES'S BALLS START TO MOVE.
BEAUTIFUL RECOVERY.
YES'S BALLS MOVING AGAIN.
NOW BOTH ARE ON THE MOVE.
KEITH STARTING TO MOVE.
KEITH DROPS.
JOE WINS HIS SECOND INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
JOE, COME ON OVER.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
 Jeff: FOR THE SECOND TIME,
IMMUNITY, YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
THE WEAR THE NECKLACE IN THIS
GAME.
JOE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 21
DAY, SOMEBODY GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
 THANK GOD I WON IMMUNITY.
I KNOW MY NAME IS BEING FLOATED
AROUND EVERYWHERE, SO LET'S GO
GET STEPHEN, SO HE THREW MY NAME
OUT THERE.
WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT.
 GOOD JOB, JOE.
 THAT WAS AWESOME.
 YOU WERE AMAZING.
 I COULDN'T LET KEITH BEAT ME.
 YOU KILLED IT, DUDE.
 DIDN'T GIVE IT ENOUGH.
 JOE.
 I'M SO FRUSTRATED.
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON GETTING
JOE OUT SINCE THE GAME BEGAN,
AND ONCE AGAIN HE WINS FREAKING
IMMUNITY.
IT'S LIKE MOBY DICK, JOE IS MY
WHITE WHALE, AND I'M AHAB ON A
CRAZY QUEST TO ELIMINATE JOE,
AND HE KEEPS EVADING US.
 WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?
 LOOK, I THINK STEPHEN'S GOT
TO GO.
HE'S SO DANGEROUS.
 JEREMY?
 I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE
ON BOARD FOR SURE.
 LET ME KNOW.
 THANKS.
 VOTING OUT STEPHEN WOULD BE A
PRETTY BIG MOVE, BUT FOR ME,
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE: STEPHEN IS
THROWING MY NAME OUT THERE, SO
WE NEED TO GET RID OF HIM.
AND I'M GOING TO USE THE THREE
GIRLS WHO ARE ON THE BOTTOM TO
DO IT.
 THIS IS LIKE KIND OF A BIG
VOTE, BUT IT'S THERE'S THIS COOL
THING WE COULD DO, SAVAGE WANTS
STEPHEN OUT.
 HE DOES?
 WHICH IS GREAT.
FANTASTIC.
 OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SO EVIL
RIGHT NOW.
 YES.
 CIERA, ABI AND MYSELF, WE'RE
ON THE BOTTOM, SO I THOUGHT I
WAS TOTALLY SCREWED.
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, JOE TELLS
ME, HEY, I'M GOING TO BLINDSIDE
FISHBACH.
I'M LIKE, FANTASTIC.
LOVE IT.
 I'M WRITING THAT NAME.
 NO MATTER WHAT.
 NO MATTER WHAT.
 OKAY.
THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO, FISH.
THIS IS HUGE, AND IT'S TRUE.
I HAVE AN IDOL, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO USE IT THIS EARLY IN THE GAME
IF I DON'T HAVE TO.
 THIS HAS TO STAY BETWEEN YOU
AND ME, PROMISE TO GOD.
FISHBACH, TOTAL MINDSIDE.
JOE SAID I'M WRITING FISH
TONIGHT.
 I'M SO DOWN WITH THAT.
 AT THIS POINT I WOULD BE OKAY
WITH ANYBODY AS LONG AS IT
WASN'T ME OR YOU.
 I KNOW.
I'M GOING TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.
 ME TOO.
 HE'S REALLY DANGEROUS.
HE'S STILL ACTING LIKE HE'S
BAYON STRONG AND ALL THAT, AND
HE'S NOT.
I KNOW HIS BIG MOVE IS COMING.
I THINK WE GOT TO LET HIM GO.
 WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP?
 WE ALL GOOD?
ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT?
 FISHBACH?
 HE'S BEEN BRINGING UP JOE'S
NAME, AND HE'S A HUGE THREAT.
 SAVAGE, NOW HE WANTS TO TAKE
OUT STEPHEN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
TRYING TO GET RID OF JOE.
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD
BE A BAD MOVE FOR ME BECAUSE
STEPHEN HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 20
DAYS.
I'VE BEEN BUILDING TRUST WITH
HIM, SO I WANT STEPHEN TO COME
WITH ME FAR INTO THIS GAME.
BECAUSE ONCE THE BIG GUYS START
GOING AT EACH OTHER, I WANT TO
HAVE ALL THE BULLETS.
 HE PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING
THE GREATEST STRATEGIST IN THE
HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR."
 I HEAR, THAT I UNDERSTAND
100%, BUT THIS IS THE THING, I
DON'T WANT TO LET THE GIRLS GET
TOO STRONG.
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE KNOW WHAT
HE WANTS TO DO, AND HE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT
WITHOUT US COOPERATING.
 TRUE.
 I JUST THINK WE TAKE OUT
WENTWORTH OR CIERA.
IF WE TAKE ANOTHER ONE DOWN AND
THEN WE CAN START TRIMMING THE
FAT ON OUR SIDE, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
 YOU GUYS MAKE GREAT
ARGUMENTS.
I'LL DO WHATEVER THE GROUP WANTS
TO DO.
 AS A LAWYER, I PLEADED MY
CASE, AND I'M USED TO KIND OF
GETTING WHAT I WANT, AND I
DIDN'T, SO I'M DISAPPOINTED, BUT
JEREMY MADE A VALID POINT.
THOSE TWO GIRLS ARE DANGEROUS.
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO
IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
THERE'S A LOT OF RUNNING AROUND?
 OKAY.
NONE OF US TRUST STEPHEN, BUT WE
DON'T WANT TO TAKE OUT STEPHEN
AND TAKE A DIVIDE.
 OH, MAN.
 THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.
 I'M THINKING, OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE STEPHEN.
I'M GOING TO RECONFIRM WITH
EVERYBODY.
BUT STEPHEN APPARENTLY HAS MORE
CONNECTIONS IN THIS GAME THAN I
REALIZED.
 WHAT'S THE WORD, BIRD?
 NO BUENO?
 NO STEPHEN IN
 TRAVIS WAS ALL FOR IT.
 HE HAS SOMETHING DEEPER WITH
FISHBACH.
 EXACTLY.
 SO IS THE WORD WENTWORTH OR
ME NOW?
 ME, RIGHT?
 I DON'T KNOW YET.
 ONE MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO
BLINDSIDE FISHBACH.
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, THAT
PLAN HAS TOTALLY FALLEN ASIDE.
JOE WILL NOT VOTE, SO HE'S DEAD
TO ME.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT TRIBAL IS
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER.
I'M SO FRICKEN TIRED OF THEIR
HALF-ASS PLANS.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR?
 WOULD IT MATTER IF IT'S
FISHBACH OR SAVAGE?
 I THINK WE ALL SHOULD VOTE
FOR THE SAME PERSON.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
LET'S DECIDE.
 I'VE BEEN BEGGING THESE
PEOPLE THE WAKE UP TO, PLAY THE
GAME, BUT I'M PLAYING WITH A
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT
TO MAKE MOVES, SO AT THIS POINT
I AM SCARED FOR MY LIFE.
I GUESS I'M HOPING FOR A MIRACLE
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IDEALLY.
 Jeff: WE BRING IN THE FIRST
MEMBER OF OUR JURY, KASS VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT
OFF AT THE LAST TRIBAL, CIERA.
YOU DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WERE
PLAYING.
DID THAT THEME CONTINUE ON AFTER
TRIBAL?
 YES.
IT'S THE SAME THING, DIFFERENT
DAY.
NOBODY IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR
SPOT IN THE TOP.
IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME.
 JEFF, I'M GOING THE LAY IT
OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.
THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE RUNNING
THIS GAME.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO GO ONE BY
ONE UP THE LADDER, AND THAT'S
IT.
 Jeff: BUT IF IT'S ONLY FOUR
PEOPLE, THAT LEAVES EIGHT OTHER
PEOPLE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO
SWALLOW THOSE FOUR.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD THINK,
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO MAKE A MOVE.
 Jeff: CIERA, YOU WANT
PEOPLE TO MAKE BIG MOVES, MAKE
ONE.
WHO ARE THE FOUR PEOPLE?
 YES, JEFF.
THE FOUR ARE JEREMY, SAVAGE,
TASHA, STEPHEN OR JOE.
 Jeff: JEREMY, THERE IS A
CONSISTENT GROUP OF NAMES THAT
KEEP GETTING CALLED OUT AS THE
CORE, AND YOU ARE IN IT.
 YEAH, BUT THE STATEMENT WAS
THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE RUNNING THE
SHOW, AND SHE CAME UP WITH FIVE
PEOPLE, SO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO IS RUNNING THE SHOW.
 Jeff: JOE, IT DOESN'T
MATTER IF SOMETHING IS TRUE OR
NOT.
IT ONLY MATTERS WHAT PEOPLE
BELIEVE.
 PERCEPTION IS TRUTH, SO THE
ONLY GUARANTEE OF SAFETY YOU
HAVE IN THIS GAME IS THIS RIGHT
HERE.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, YOUR NAME WAS
BROUGHT UP AS BEING ONE OF THE
CORE, AS WELL.
HOW DOES THIS FEEL HAVING YOUR
NAME BEING TOSSED AROUND?
 YES, THERE ARE A BUNCH OF US
THAT TALK OFTEN.
WE HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH
OTHER.
THERE'S ALSO A BUNCH OF OTHERS
THAT ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL AT US
WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS AS A
GROUP.
 Jeff: CIERA?
 I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY IS
BUYING THAT.
IF THERE IS ABALLIANCE, SOMEBODY
IS HERE ON THE TOP AND SOMEBODY
IS ON THE BOTTOM.
SOME PEOPLE ARE GREAT TO BE ABLE
TO SAY, WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE AND
EVERYONE IS EQUAL AND HAVE
PEOPLE BELIEVE IT.
MORE POWER TO THEM.
I'M FRUSTRATED WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO CAN IN THE OUT SEE AND HEAR
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND
THINKING, MAYBE I'M NOT AT THE
TOP AND NOT ACTING.
TIME TO WAKE UP.
 Jeff: SPENCER, NOT ONLY DO
WE HAVE RETURNING PLAYERS, WE
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A LOT
OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY
MIGHT REACT IN A SITUATION.
SO WHAT CIERA IS SAYING MAY BE
TRUE.
 WHAT CIERA'S SAYING PROBABLY
IS TRUE, AND WHEN YOU HAVE
RETURNING PLAYERS, MAYBE THEY'RE
WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE SOME
FLIP OR MAYBE THERE'S AN IDOL IN
PLAY.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY IDOLS.
SPENCER, A COUPLE TIMES, IT'S
BEEN AS IF NOBODY IS REALLY
LOOKING FOR THE IDOLS.
IS THAT THE FEELING?
 I THINK MOST PEOPLE ASSUME
THERE ARE SOMEHOW NOT IDOLS AND
THEY'VE BEEN FOUND OR THEY'RE
WAITING TO BE PLAYED.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, WHERE DO YOU
FALL WITH THIS MAKE A BIG MOVE
PLEA THAT CIERA IS MAKING?
 IT'S FASCINATING.
I THINK IT'S A PLEA THAT CIERA
CAN MAKE BECAUSE SHE'S NOT IN
THE ALLIANCE AND SHE'S AT THE
BOTTOM.
IF SHE WERE SITTING IN A FEW
OTHER FOLKS' POSITION, SHE
WOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT.
 I FEEL LIKE YOU GUESS ARE ALL
ACTING LIKE I'M WANTING
SOMETHING CRAZY TO HAPPEN.
I'M NOT ASKING ANYBODY TO DO
ANYTHING BIZARRE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO FIGHT FOR YOUR
SPOT IN THE GAME, AND I DON'T
THINK THAT'S SO BIG.
 I DON'T AGREE THERE IS A
BOTTOM HERE.
 YOU WOULDN'T.
 I HONESTLY THINK THE WAY
WE'VE PLAYED IS DIFFERENT THAN
ALL OF THE 30 PREVIOUS SEASONS
WE'VE ALL STUDIED AND WATCHED.
WE'VE SWAPPED A DOZEN TIMES.
WE'VE ALL BEEN PLAYING REALLY
HARD.
IT'S NOT HOW IT TYPICALLY IS.
 BUT SOME THINGS ARE FLAVOR
GOING TO CHANGE.
IN AN ALLIANCE, SOMEBODY IS ON
THE TOP AND SOMEBODY IS ON THE
BOTTOM.
SOME OF YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT IN
THE TIGHT FOUR AND THEY'RE STILL
NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHERE I'M FRUSTRATED.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN?
 IT'S CLEAR THAT ABI, CIERA
AND MYSELF ARE ON THE BOTTOM, SO
IT SEEMS LIKE THE EASY VOTE
WOULD BE ONE OF US, BUT SOMEONE
CAME TO ME TODAY AND SAID, I
WANT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.
I DIDN'T GO TO THEM.
 Jeff: YOUR POINT IS
WHATEVER PEOPLE THINK IS TIGHT
CAN'T BE BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S
ALREADY APPROACHING YOU.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT'S NOT ME ON THE BOTTOM TRYING
TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.
I'M SAYING OTHER PEOPLE SAYING
THAT TO ME.
 Jeff: WHY WOULDN'T YOU OUT
THOSE PEOPLE IF YOU'RE TRULY ON
THE BOTTOM AND DESPERATE?
 WELL, WHAT IF I'M HERE
TOMORROW AND I HAVE TO WORK WITH
THEM?
 Jeff: JOE, THIS IS TOUGH.
EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, THERE'S
ANOTHER OBSTACLE.
IT'S LIKE PLAYING CHESS YOU
DON'T KNOW WHICH PIECES ARE
WHICH ONES.
IT'S NERVE-RACKING, IT'S
EXCITING.
I EXPECTED NOTHING LESS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S FIND OUT WHERE IT'S GOING
THE FALL.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
WIGLESWORTH, YOU'RE UP.
 I WOULD HAVE TRIED THE SAME
PLEA YOU MADE IF I WERE IN YOUR
SPOT.
LUCKILY I'M NOT.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AWB YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF, I MAY BE
ON THE BOTTOM, BUT I'M NOT READY
TO GO HOME YET.
 OH, MY GOD.
 NO WAY!
 OH, MY GOD.
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
 NO.
 I HAD NO IDEA.
 THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOMENT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE THIS.
 DONE.
 WOW.
 YES.
 Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR WENTWORTH
WILL NOT COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
 FUNNY.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH.
WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH, WILL NOT COUNT.
WENTWORTH, WILL NOT COUNT.
WEPT WORTH, WILL NOT COUNT.
SAVAGE.
 ALL RIGHT, BABY.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
SAVAGE.
BRING ME YOU TORCH.
 I'M LOYAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT
I'M, WITH Y'ALL.
 LOVE YOU.
 Jeff: SAVAGE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 GOOD LUCK, ANDREW.
 HE MADE IT TO THE JURY.
 RIGHT BACK AT YOU.
 Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL CENTERED AROUND WHEN IS
SOMEBODY GOING TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE.
TURNS OUT IT WAS TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 WE HAVE TO GO FIND AN IDOL.
 EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.
 YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT
IS.
 Jeff: BUT WHAT THEY DON'T
KNOW IS THAT IT'S RIGHT IN FROM
THE OF THEM.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE
THE CHANGE YOUR SITUATION.
FIRST PERSON TO TOUCH THEIR BUOY
EARNS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.
 THAT'S STUNNING.
NO ONE SAW THAT COMING.
WENTWORTH DID, BUT I'LL BE
DARNED.
I DID SOME THINGS OUT HERE THAT
I DIDN'T DO 12 YEARS EARLIER.
I PROVED AT LEAST IN MY MIND I
CAN HANG WITH SOME UNBELIEVABLE
SURVIVORS.
I PLAYED THE GAME, THE STRATEGY
GAME PRETTY DARN WELL, EXCEPT
FOR A FEW MINUTES AGO.
NOT GOING TO LIE, IT RIPS MY
HEART OUT.
