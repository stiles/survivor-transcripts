         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, 19
Americans were marooned off the
rugged coast of Fiji.
The Moto Tribe won a luxurious
camp with an elaborate shelter
that was stocked with food,
supplies, and comfortable
amenities.
 It's not even survival.
It's thrival.
 Water!








 Just lick some leaves, man.
 PROBST: But the Ravu Tribe
struggled to survive on a beach
with few resources.
 I never experienced
dehydration like this.
Half of us can't even stand up.
It's crazy!
We're starving here, bro!
 PROBST: Moto...
...wins reward!
...the tribe of luxury,
dominated in the challenges.
Moto wins reward!








First person voted out of
Survivor: Fiji...
In the beginning, the women took
the hardest hits at tribal
council.
Jessica, Erica, and Sylvia were
the first to be voted out.
 I can't function like this.
 All right, Gary, I'm going to
call in the medical boat and get
you out of here.
 PROBST: Gary was the first
man to leave when he fell ill...
 One, two, three, lift.
 PROBST: ...and was evacuated
for medical attention.
Fourth person voted out of
Survivor: Fiji...
At tribal council...
 Wow.
 PROBST: ...Liliana was next
to go...
Rita, the tribe has spoken.
...followed by Rita.
Drop your buffs.
 What?
 Mookie.
 PROBST: When the tribes were
mixed, the new Ravu Tribe found
itself with six strong men and
Lisi.
Ravu was physically strong, but
the luck of the draw sent them
to live on the beach with
nothing.
 What do you guys think about
me, you, Ed, Dreamz?
 PROBST: Alex, Edgardo,
Mookie, and Dreamz bonded
together to form a formidable
alliance.
 All right.
 PROBST: They called
themselves the four horsemen.
 Right now we have to get
nasty, and we have to use
everything that we have.
 PROBST: At the luxurious new
Moto camp...
 So we'll use that line.
 PROBST: ...another alliance
of four revolved around Earl and
Yau-Man, and included Cassandra
and Michelle.
 It's all about the team.
Who has all the power?
That would be me.
 PROBST: There were two hidden
immunity idols, one at each
camp.
Mookie, Alex, and Edgardo found
the hidden idol on Ravu.
 There's no words to describe
how much this means to me in
this game.
 PROBST: They kept it secret
from their tribe mates Lisi and
Dreamz.
And with Earl's help, Yau-Man
found the one on Moto.
 This is my million dollars.
 PROBST: Excluded from the
core alliances, Anthony, Rocky,
and Lisi...
The tribe has spoken.
...were quickly picked off.
On day 22...
 Look at that.
 PROBST: ...the two tribes
merged into one.
Excited that they were moving to
the Moto camp of luxury, they
were shocked to find everything
gone.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, no!
 PROBST: The stage was set for
a battle between the two
competing alliances.
 So the moment has finally
arrived.
I'm ready to fight.
 PROBST: You will not be going
back to camp.
We're heading to tribal council
right now.
In a twist that sent Michelle to
tribal council without her
allies Earl, Yau-Man, and
Cassandra, she was voted off.
The tribe has spoken.
 That just flipped the whole
script around.
 PROBST: The four horsemen had
the upper hand.
 Unless I'm mistaken, the four
of us are controlling this game
right now.
 I didn't tell you, but we
found the immunity idol on Ravu.
 PROBST: But a revealing
secret caused Dreamz to waver.
 We had a pact, and it kind of
made me not trust them a little
bit.
So I'm going to trust them until
I can't trust them no more.
I'm not going to deceive y'all.
 PROBST: In a bold move,
Dreamz betrayed the four
horsemen.
 Mookie's got an immunity
idol.
 Cassandra wants me gone.
 PROBST: Alex, sensing that he
was in danger, asked Mookie for
the protection of the hidden
idol.
 It's going to work, Mook.
It's going to work.
 Mookie gave Alex the idol.
 PROBST: But Dreamz informed
Earl's alliance that now Alex
had the idol.
 He gave it to him?
 I promise, I promise.
 PROBST: So they switched
their vote to Edgardo.
 If we hit them with Edgardo,
that hits them from the left
side.
 PROBST: At tribal council,
Alex confidently played the
idol.
Alex is immune from tonight's
vote.
But the votes for Edgardo
spelled the end of the four
horsemen.
Edgardo, the tribe has spoken.
The writing was on the wall, and
Mookie and Alex were the next to
go.
On day 34, Yau-Man played hard
and won a 2008 Ford Super Duty
truck.
And he continued to play hard
when he immediately turned it
into a bargaining chip.
 Dreamz, how badly do you need
that car?
 You know how bad I need a
car, Yau-Man.
 I want to see if I can make a
deal.
There are six of us left now,
right?
 Yes.
 When there are four of us
left, if you and I happen to be
one of the four, if you win the
immunity for that round, you
will give it to me.
 I promise to God.
 PROBST: So I want to be
clear.
You're saying, "I'll give you
the truck."
 Right.
 PROBST: You can't enforce it.
It's his word.
 It's his word.
It's his word.
His word is good.
 I give you my word, Yau.
 PROBST: Yau-Man then
strategically sent himself to
Exile Island, where he could
read the clue for the rehidden
idol.
 "If you're pining for
treasure, it's within your
reach."
 PROBST: Yau-Man, already in
possession of one hidden
immunity idol, gave Earl the
clue to the new rehidden idol,
and Earl quickly found it.
 There you go.
And we are in business.
 PROBST: Boo saved himself
when he won the next immunity
challenge.
Boo wins immunity!
Finding a loophole in the truck-
for-immunity deal, Dreamz
plotted to oust Yau-Man before
the final four to avoid the
dilemma he might face later.
 I want to get rid of Yau
today.
Yau has an immunity idol.
I give him mine idol at top
four, so that puts him two spots
up.
 PROBST: But Yau-Man sensed
danger.
 I have bad vibes.
 PROBST: So at tribal
council...
If anybody has the hidden
immunity idol and feels they
need to play it, now is the time
to do so.
...in another strategic move,
Yau-Man played the idol and
saved himself.
With just two votes against her,
Stacy joined the jury.
Now only five remain: Earl, Yau-
Man, Dreamz, Cassandra, and Boo.
Will Dreamz win immunity and
keep his word with Yau-Man?
Find out tonight as they compete
in their final immunity
challenges, and one outlasts all
the rest to become the sole
survivor.
( theme song playing )
 Yeah.
Tribal council was brutal
tonight, lots of talk concerning
my truck giveaway and how that
put a big target on my back.
So I ended up using my hidden
immunity idol, which was a good
thing, because otherwise I
wouldn't have been here.
 You did what you were
supposed to do, and you played
the idol.
I mean, it could have been just
to flush the idol out.
 Yeah.
 Because they know that you
have it.
They're still not certain
whether I have it or not.
 Right.
Keep it that way.
 I always get suspicious when
people don't tell me what
they're doing.
 Right.
 That's the dead giveaway.
When you don't tell me
anything....
 They might try to target me,
because now they know that I
don't trust them.
Obviously, it's time for me to
protect myself.
It's all about cannibalism now,
trying to eat each other up.
 Two more days to go.
Here's one for you.
 Day 37 and five of us left,
and because of my deal with
Dreamz, I am probably the
biggest target.
Because if they vote me out
before final four, then Dreamz
will not have to renege on his
public agreement with me.
So what I need to do at this
immunity challenge is to win.
 We're thinking that you're
standing with Yau, and now
you're telling us that, you
know, you would have been down
with whatever.
 That's where everybody's
messing up.
I've always said certain people
in the top five.
I never changed that.
And we weren't at the top five.
So I wasn't going to write down
Yau's name, because that's going
against my word on what I gave
Yau.
And totally expected it.
That's why I said I wouldn't
have told him.
I said it would have been to Yau
to defend himself.
 Unfortunately, it does become
a time in the game where you do
have to look at your own
personal interests and cut your
friends out.
And I don't see any way that
Earl is going to vote Yau or
Yau's going to vote Earl.
So Dreamz, Boo, and myself,
we're going to have to bond
together while we have the
numbers to level the playing
field.
 So whenever people try to be
slick...
 But does he have it?
You said you'd be real with us.
 All right.
 He has three clues.
I mean, you know, he could have
found it pretty quickly.
 If Earl has the hidden
immunity idol and Yau-Man wins
the immunity today, we're in
trouble.
Definitely Dreamz, myself, or
Boo will be going home.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Guys ready to get to today's
challenge?
 Sure.
 PROBST: First thing's first.
Boo, take back the immunity
necklace.
 Always my favorite part.
 PROBST: Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you will
make your way through a massive,
five-section maze, and you will
be doing so blindfolded.
Here's how it works.
Each of you will be wearing a
uniquely shaped medallion.
On my go, you'll negotiate the
maze until you find a key
station.
Feel for the shape that matches
your medallion.
Retrieve your key.
You must then find your way to
the correct drawbridge.
You're going to use your key to
unlock the drawbridge, lower it,
and then cross over into the
next section of the maze.
If you get lost at any point,
there are guide posts in each
section that will help you find
your way.
First person to get all five
keys, cross all five drawbridges
wins immunity, will be in the
final four.
The rest of you, tribal council
tonight.
Somebody will be going home.
Based on the last tribal
council, I'd say everybody is
equally vulnerable at this
point.
We'll draw for colors.
We'll get started.
Here we go, for immunity and a
guaranteed spot in the final
four.
Survivors ready?
Go!
It is a long maze, nearly the
length of a football field.
You have time to catch up if you
fall behind.
Boo at the first key station.
Boo has his first key.
He's heading out, looking for
that drawbridge now.
Yau-Man has his first key.
He's heading out, looking for
that drawbridge.
Dreamz has his first key.
Yau-Man at his first drawbridge.
Earl at the first key station.
Yau-Man's at his drawbridge,
unlocked.
He's lowering it, and he's
crossing it.
Yau-Man takes the lead.
Dreamz goes in the water.
That tells me he's close to a
drawbridge.
Boo heard the sound of the water
and followed it.
Boo now completely in the water.
Dreamz has his drawbridge
lowered.
He's heading across.
Yau-Man at a guide post.
Boo has his drawbridge lowered.
He's heading across.
Each section gets more
difficult, more complicated.
Hang in there.
Yau-Man has his second key.
Nobody panicking.
Long way to go.
Boo has his second key.
He's heading back out, looking
for that drawbridge now.
Earl has lowered his first
drawbridge.
 PROBST: Dreamz now has his
second key.
Yau-Man at his second
drawbridge.
Dreamz using that guide post,
trying to get oriented.
Boo has found his second
drawbridge.
Cassandra finally at the first
key station.
Dreamz now crossing his second
drawbridge.
Yau-Man is at his third key
station.
Yau-Man still in the lead.
Dreamz now at the third key
station.
Boo and Dreamz crossing paths,
one heading in, one heading out.
Boo has his third key.
Yau-Man has found his third
drawbridge.
Got to unlock it and lower it.
Right now it is Yau-Man, Dreamz,
and Boo that are in this
challenge, Cassandra and Earl
out of it.
Boo lowers his third drawbridge.
Dreamz and Yau-Man both looking
for their fourth key.
Boo at a guide post.
Yau-Man has found the fourth key
station.
Dreamz at the fourth key
station.
Dreamz has his fourth key.
Yau-Man is at his fourth
drawbridge.
Boo has his fourth key.
Yau-Man has his fourth
drawbridge lowered, and he's
crossing it, looking for his
fifth and final key.
Boo and Dreamz both looking for
that fourth drawbridge.
Do not panic.
Orient yourself.
Yau-Man hits a dead end.
Dreamz is at his fourth
drawbridge.
He has it lowered.
Dreamz now heading across,
looking for that fifth key
station.
Boo has his fourth drawbridge.
He's to get it unlocked.
Boo is across his fourth
drawbridge.
We are in the final section, one
last key station to find.
Yau-Man is at the fifth and
final key station.
Dreamz hits a dead end.
Boo hits a dead end.
Yau-Man has his fifth key.
Boo and Dreamz have to hustle.
You guys are not out of this.
Keep it up!
Yau-Man runs into another dead
end.
Yau-Man's run into the
drawbridges.
Now he's got to find his.
He's unlocking it, lowering it,
and crossing it.
Yau-Man wins immunity!
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Yau-Man, come on
over.
Yau-Man is safe at tonight's
tribal council.
Boo, Cassandra, Dreamz, Earl,
after 37 long days, somebody
going home tonight.
Should be a crazy afternoon.
See you at tribal.
Head on back to camp.
 Well, I just won immunity.
That guarantees my place in the
final four.
I cannot be voted out tonight.
Earl has the other rehidden
immunity idol, so he cannot be
voted out.
This was a very important win
for me.
 Okay.
 And we're at the final four,
then we'll decided what to do.
 Oh, okay, all right, all
right, we're good.
 We're good.
 All right, proud of you.
 Thank you.
If everybody plays it straight,
it will be Boo, unless Boo tries
to make some deals with other
people.
Boo, I'd like to say you are one
of the strongest competitors
I've ever met.
 I know that's why you're
voting me out tonight.
I understand.
 No hard feelings, okay?
I know you play really,
really... I mean, you don't give
up, and I appreciate that.
 I knew at the challenge, when
I looked at it, what the writing
on the wail said.
It read, "Boo, good game; it's
time for you to go."
 I'm voting Boo.
There's no... come on, now.
 I don't need a heads-up
before I leave.
I don't care.
You know what I mean?
I'm a man.
I feel I'm a man.
I feel you're a man.
Even when I leave tonight or
tomorrow, I'm going to still
say, "Yeah, Yau-Man is the
smartest man I ever knew.
Yau-Man was one of the world's
greatest fathers to me."
And that's how I see things.
I wouldn't be surprised if I was
voted out tonight, because
people have been lying and
trying to blind-side people from
the time we started playing this
game.
So if they say they was going to
vote Boo home and then vote me
home, I wouldn't be... that
wouldn't surprise me at all.
As a matter of fact, tonight is
going to be the first night that
I take all my stuff to tribal
council.
 Earl, can I talk to you for a
couple minutes?
 Uh-huh.
 I can compete well against
Yau.
I think me and you together have
a much better chance than one of
us against him, because he's
good.
 Yeah, there's a better chance
when it's you and me.
 That's what I'm saying.
 So my plea to Earl was to
vote out Dreamz.
Take me to the final three with
you, Yau, and myself.
I said you're guaranteed second
when you go with Yau.
You have an option to win a
million if you go against me.
That's a difference of $900,000.
That's my plea.
And either way you decide, I'll
respect it.
 I'll definitely give it some
thought.
 It's a decent option for
Earl.
It's a great option for me.
If he takes it, he takes it, and
I live to play another day.
 I'm always puzzled at this
point.
Boo proposed to vote out Dreamz.
That would just be the smart
thing for me to do.
Everybody would want to go
against Boo.
You know, I'd rather go against
Boo or Cassandra than go against
Dreamz or Yau-Man.
Dreamz gets the sympathy vote,
and Yau-Man gets the underdog
vote.
It's not about who I like and
who I got alliances with.
It's who can I beat in the final
two.
 Well, do you think there's
going to be one more challenge
tomorrow?
 Uh-huh.
 You believe that you think
it's wise to bring Dreamz to the
last challenge?
Dreamz has a chance of winning a
challenge, and he's definitely
got a chance at winning a vote.
 Sympathy vote.
 Huh?
 Sympathy vote.
 Oh, yeah.
I think you'll win against
everybody else but Dreamz.
That's been my thought the whole
way.
So if you wanted to make a deal
with me, I would definitely take
second place over fifth place.
You'll win a vote against me.
 Boo's plan does sound
enticing.
I'm thinking through it.
But to change from him to
Dreamz, I need one more vote.
 So we're good, man.
Good job today, man, getting
that immunity.
 Yeah.
 Good job, because you know...
 Uh-huh.
 Tonight is going to be pins
and needles night.
I think I put myself again in a
decent position, but it will be
a little nerve-racking until the
votes are tallied up.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury: Rocky,
Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,
Alex, and Stacy, voted out at
the last tribal council.
Dreamz, with only five people
left in the game, let's talk
about threats.
Are you more concerned about
somebody who is a physical
threat or somebody who's not
trustworthy and could betray you
this late in the game?
 I'm more concerned about
somebody who ain't keeping their
word, because anybody can win a
challenge, you know what I mean?
So I'm more concerned about
somebody who don't keep their
word.
 PROBST: So that's got to be
difficult to navigate at this
point, because keeping your word
has not been the thing that's
going on at tribal council
lately.
 It's a game for a million
dollars.
When it comes to just saying
words, sometimes you've got to
take a step of faith.
Sometimes you've just got to
know your gut feeling.
 PROBST: Earl, should this
game couple down to the most
deserving or "Just as long as I
can beat them"?
 Um, trust goes a long way,
but at the very end, even your
closest friend, you'll still
have that one little part of you
that's like, "Well, I might not
be able to beat this person, so
I might choose this person."
So it's a lot of careful
thinking involved with this-- a
lot.
 PROBST: Boo, today's immunity
challenge, Yau-Man wins, you get
back to camp, people start
scrambling?
 I think I was the only one
that suggested a few things,
because I think that Dreamz is
going to be dangerous, and I'm a
better candidate to take to the
final over Dreamz or Yau.
Dreamz is popular.
He'll get a sympathy vote also.
I think Yau has worked hard.
He hasn't made any enemies.
So they're going to be very hard
to beat in a vote.
 Let me say something.
As far as being popular or
whatever, I don't know if this
is high school or whatever, but
as far as trying to get sympathy
votes, you know, I tell people
my life story to show how far
people can make it if they keep
trying, not to get no sympathy
votes.
 I didn't say you were trying
to get sympathy.
I just said you will get a
sympathy vote.
 But I'm just saying I don't
do that for sympathy votes or
anything like that.
 PROBST: Make you a little
uneasy when you hear Boo saying,
"Dreamz is popular, and Yau-Man
is popular"?
Because Yau-Man is wearing
immunity.
He's not going anywhere tonight.
 At this point, Yau-Man's got
me as part of his top four
strategy.
That shows me that I'll at least
be here probably until the top
four if everybody is doing what
they said they're going to do,
you know?
 PROBST: So you're now taking
the negotiation and throwing it
back on Yau-Man, because "I owe
you in four, so you might as
well keep me till four."
 Pretty much, or he did that
all in vain.
He did it all in vain if he
throws me away.
 And I suggested it's probably
time to get rid of Dreamz now
instead of me-- no offense,
Dreamz.
 No, I feel you.
 And I still think that would
be the best thing.
 But if he stayed in the game,
he might keep winning
challenges.
Now, he knows better than to
take Yau, and Yau knows that.
 That would be up to Yau to
make that decision.
 He would know better than to
take Yau.
 I mean, I don't have any
enemies, per se, but I don't
have any friends on that jury,
you know?
Dreamz is going to win by a
landslide.
Yau would win by a landslide.
And I told Earl and Yau, if you
want to guarantee that I will
take you, then I will guarantee
you that if I win.
I said, "I don't think anybody
else is going to take you to the
final two."
 PROBST: All right, let's get
to the vote.
If anybody has the hidden
immunity idol, tonight is the
last time you can play it.
You would present it to me
before I read the votes.
Yau-Man you have the immunity
necklace.
Are you going to hang on to
that?
 Yes.
 PROBST: You cannot vote for
Yau-Man.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.
Dreamz, you're up.
 It's just your time, bro.
 Gone, Dreamz.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Okay, if anybody has the hidden
immunity idol and you want to
play it, now is the last time
you can play it.
Earl is playing the last hidden
immunity idol.
All votes cast for Earl will not
count.
All right, once the votes are
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Boo.
Dreamz.
One vote Boo, one vote Dreamz.
Boo.
Two votes Boo, one vote Dreamz.
14th person voted out and the
eighth member of our jury, Boo.
That's three.
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Boo, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Well, you have made it to the
final four.
You have two days left in this
game.
Head back to camp.
Try to get some sleep.
Good night.
 Well, night 37, and I've been
voted out.
Yau is a strong competitor.
He's going to be a hard person
to beat, and I respect him on
many different levels.
It'd be funny if Dreamz still
takes immunity and keeps it.
I don't think he's going to
break his word, but wow, there's
going to be some fireworks
tomorrow.
 See how clear the water is.
 It's a nice, calm day.
 I'll never forget this big
piece of rock here.
I've been staring at it every
afternoon.
One more night.
 Yeah, just one more night.
 It's a great accomplishment,
a great feat for me to make it
to final four.
This is quite amazing for me,
when I think back all the things
I went through in Ravu 38 days
ago and the hard times there,
and now I'm at the final four,
really.
 Very nice, man.
This is how it's supposed to
happen, and this is what's
happening.
Yau and myself, we both have the
same values and morals in life.
Yau is a very, very nice guy,
and him and I respect one
another and admire one another.
And we sincerely know we're
going to be friends for a
lifetime.
The older Chinese guy, the young
black guy, friends, who'd have
ever thought that?
That's like Rush Hour.
 Last full day on the island.
 I sealed my fate.
My fate was sealed when I took
the truck.
 And look what you got.
 I just want to do it in front
of everybody.
I just want my son see me as a
man of my word.
At a reward challenge, Yau won a
truck.
He gave me the truck in exchange
of if I win immunity at four, I
will give him the necklace at
tribal council.
So today, winning the immunity
challenge is very important to
me.
 If I had known early how much
the truck cost, I would have not
been so fast to make that deal.
 Yau-Man, that's what nobody
understands.
It's not just a truck.
I seen a man who give away
another something to another man
that he don't have.
And it could have been strategy.
It could have been whatever.
But it helped me.
My game plan is to give Yau the
necklace, and whatever happens
tonight, I'm happy.
 A bone.
 Bone.
 A bone.
 A bone.
 "Congratulations, final four.
You have done what 15 of your
tribesmen and women could not
do.
Today, before proceeding to your
final immunity challenge, you
will honor their memories.
Get into your boat and follow
the coast north to the river.
Proceed up the river to the
mangroves.
There you will find the torches
of your fallen comrades.
As you collect them, remember
these people and their time here
in Fiji.
Put the torches on the awaiting
canoe, light them on fire, and
reflect upon them before sending
the canoe out to sea."
 Jessica, sorry you were the
first to go.
We hardly knew you.
 It sucks to be the first
person voted off.
But you also have respect, like,
"Hey, they're playing the game."
This is what you all signed up
for.
 Well, Erica.
 I came here to interact with
people, to be strong, and I feel
like when I walked away, that
there was nothing else that I
could have done better, and I
really felt good about that.
 Sylvia, sorry that you had to
go so early.
 I thought I did a pretty good
job of suppressing my natural
leadership skills, but my tribe
saw right through me and got to
the heart of it, which was I was
a bossy son of a bitch.
 Big ups for Papa Smurf.
 Papa Smurf.
 For me, it was an absolute
great experience.
You know, it would have been
better to go longer, but hell,
I'm here at this age.
That's half the battle right
there.
 Liliana.
 I think the game Survivor is
a powerful experience because
it's like the real world.
I mean, just because someone's
smarter or stronger in a
business, at a company, doesn't
mean that they're going to be
the one promoted.
 Rita, Miss Venezuela, one of
the best moms in the world.
 The main lesson that I want
to teach my kids from this
experience is that if they have
a goal or a dream, that they can
stick to it and that they can
make it, no matter how hard or
how impossible it seems.
 Anthony, I wish you could be
here longer with us.
 Even though people here have
tried to put me down, I walk
away from this a better person
and a stronger person.
Hopefully, I'll be able to take
this experience and turn it into
something better for my life.
 Hey there, Rocky boy, Mr.
Boston.
 To be honest with you, a
straight shooter like myself
probably doesn't have any
business being in this game, you
know?
It's really hard, because you
got to have your cards up at all
times.
I mean, you can't show anybody
nothing, and I wear my emotions
on my sleeve.
 Lisi.
 I'll tell you what I lacked--
the ability to stick it out,
which was my demise.
If you could stick it out,
that's a survivor.
 Michelle, my belle.
 I think the hardest thing for
me was really pushing my body to
limits that I didn't know it
could go to.
I guess I can just walk around a
little bit more proud of myself.
 Edgardo.
I bet you never seen it coming.
 I'm a little bit disappointed
that Dreamz messed me up in that
vote, and you know, we had a
50/50 chance, and it didn't work
out.
Hopefully things will work out
for me in the future in the real
life.
 Mookie.
 This game is based upon the
person next to you, and so it's
a lot about relying on your
alliances, your friends, and
trusting that they're going to
do what's in your group's best
interest.
 Alex, my brother for life.
 You know, I didn't make it to
the end, but I didn't need to to
know that I can be a leader, I
can be persuasive, I can
motivate.
And that will power is stronger
now than it ever has been.
 Stacy, I know you learned a
lot about yourself and learned
about life.
 You know, I'm not perfect.
I'm going to make mistakes along
the way.
But I know, like, deeper than
that, I'm adaptable, I'm
resilient, and I have a lot of
perseverance.
 Boo.
 To win, that's a pipe dream.
But to play so long and to
receive all the rewards that I
did in this beautiful place, it
was definitely a life-enhancing
experience, and I'm unbelievably
thankful.
 Ready?
 All right.
 Whoo!
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to your
final immunity challenge?
 Let's do it.
 PROBST: First thing's first.
Yau-Man, take back the immunity
necklace.
For the last time, immunity is
back up for grabs.
Today's immunity challenge will
test your threshold for pain and
your desire to win this game.
For today's challenge, you will
lie on a plank on your back with
your arms above your head,
holding on to a wooden handle.
The plank is elevated and at an
angle.
Every five minutes, I will
increase the angle of the plank,
making it more and more
difficult to hang on to.
If that wasn't enough, water
will stream out of a barrel down
the plank, making the plank
slippery.
When you've had enough, you'll
let go of the handle, you'll
slide down the plank, into the
water.
Last person left hanging on wins
immunity, is safe at tonight's
tribal council, and is
guaranteed a spot at the final
tribal council, because three of
you will face the jury and have
a shot at the million dollars.
Can't get bigger stakes than
this.
Everybody ready?
 Let's do it.
 I'm ready.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.
Everybody good?
All right, pull the rope,
releasing the water.
All right, this challenge is
officially under way.
This is a particularly
interesting challenge for Dreamz
and Yau-Man, going back to the
deal for the truck and the
promise from Dreamz that he
would do his best to win
immunity at four, and if he did,
he would give it to Yau-Man.
With a million dollars this
close, we'll see.
All right, it's time to increase
the angle.
You're now hanging at a 40-
degree angle.
This will make it a little
tougher.
Cassandra starting to slip a
little bit.
We're going to increase the
angle some more, another five
degrees.
You are now hanging at a 45-
degree angle.
You've now been up there ten
minutes.
You're starting to feel it in
your forearms.
You're going to have to overcome
that pain, find somewhere else
to take your mind.
Cassandra struggling.
Cassandra hanging on by her
fingertips.
Cassandra trying to get a grip
again, trying to pull herself up
on a slippery plank, not easy to
do.
Yau-Man readjusts again.
Dreamz sitting very comfortably.
Earl looks very comfortable.
You've been up there 15 minutes.
We're going to increase the
angle by another five degrees.
Here we go.
 Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
 PROBST: Too much for
Cassandra.
Cassandra is the first in.
We are still lowering you.
Hang tough.
Dreamz struggling.
You are now at a 50-degree
angle.
Whatever you're doing, keep
doing it.
Keep refocusing.
Keep reminding.
Don't start relaxing and get
lost and let go.
Dreamz fighting to find a
comfortable position.
Yau-Man has found a nice spot.
Earl repositioning.
You've now been up there 20
minutes.
We're going to increase the
angle yet again.
Here we go.
Hang tough.
You are now at a 55-degree
angle.
 PROBST: Dig deep.
Get a good grip.
You don't want to fall off now.
Earl fighting to stay in this.
Earl cannot hang on any longer.
Earl is the second person out of
the challenge.
It is down to Yau-Man and Dreamz
fighting for a guaranteed spot
in the final three.
Yau-Man is in the water.
Dreamz has just won the last
individual immunity.
Dreamz, come on over.
When you needed to, you did.
Dreamz has won the last
individual immunity.
And in doing so, you have
fulfilled part of the bargain
you made with Yau-Man.
The first part was you would do
your best to win.
The other part was if you did
win, you would give it to him.
Big question is now whether or
not you'll keep your word.
It should be an interesting
afternoon back at camp.
Grab your stuff.
Head on back.
 Whew.
 Oh, okay.
 I really wanted you to get
it.
 Yeah.
That was a lot of pressure.
 I'm glad you did.
 A lot of pressure.
 I'm glad you did.
Dreamz ended up winning the big
immunity challenge today.
I was glad you got it.
The deal that Dreamz has with
Yau is when there's four people
left, if Dreamz was to win the
challenge, he has to give up his
immunity necklace to Yau.
Dreamz is definitely faced with
an even tougher decision now,
now that we've been informed
that it doesn't go down to a
final two for the judging of the
million dollars.
Now it's three people.
So that means he could basically
just save himself and go back on
his word and he has a chance at
a million dollars.
 Gentlemen's honor.
There's nothing that says he has
to do it.
But it's his heart.
 Nothing to worry about.
 Yeah.
He's a good kid.
 And we're voting him out.
 Uh-huh.
There is no reason for him not
to stay on the straight and
narrow, good path.
 Wow.
 Why you saying if I change my
mind?
 This game... this game...
 If you change your mind,
would you not vote me too?
 Dreamz, I think he's really a
man of his word, but from the
very beginning, when we brought
him into our alliance, I think
he was one of the biggest wild
cards.
He seems a little bit out of
control.
But now he is in control, and he
made a promise, and it worries
me very much.
I like this.
I want this.
I'm so close to getting this.
I'm so close.
 So hard to give up a million
dollars.
 I know.
 I worked hard to get here,
lied, took out a whole alliance
that I was...
 Took out a whole alliance.
 I bowed down to a freaking
car.
 You will... you will do the
right thing.
 I want to do the right thing.
 I believe... I believe...
 If I think of my kid before I
go up there, believe the right
thing's going to happen.
And I'm going to keep thinking
about my kid, so...
I'm just saying, just in case,
I'm just giving y'all a heads-
up.
If I do the wrong thing, y'all
better vote Yau together, or one
of y'all is going home.
If I was to give the immunity
necklace for Yau-Man, in the
game, it doesn't benefit me at
all.
As a matter of fact, it
eliminates me from the
competition.
I'm good with fourth.
Fourth is good for me.
This is my expectation.
I'm good with four.
You know what I'm saying?
After the game, the benefits
that I get of giving away the
immunity necklace is people
knowing that I'm really who I
say I am.
I am an honorable person.
I am noble.
I am a truth teller.
I am Dreamz.
This is going to be one of the
most difficult decisions I ever
had to make over $1 million or
keeping my word.
So $1 million or keeping my
word, being honorable, or $1
million?
I can use both of them.
So I really don't know what I'm
going to do tonight until it
gets time to the nitty-gritty
and I have to do it.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury: Rocky,
Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,
Alex, Stacy, and Boo, voted out
at the last tribal council.
First, a little bit of business.
For the jury, today at the final
immunity challenge, they were
informed that there would be
three people at the final tribal
council.
Tonight, one person will become
the ninth and final member of
the jury.
The remaining three will be back
for the final tribal council to
try to sway you why they deserve
a million dollars.
Let's get to it.
There's really only one topic to
be talked about tonight, the
negotiation with Yau-Man and
Dreamz.
You guys made a deal.
Dreamz said, "If I'm still here
and I win the final four
immunity, I will give it to you,
Yau-Man."
Dreamz, you did win it.
You're this close to having a
shot at a million bucks.
Do you start weighing your word
versus this is a game?
 You know, in my head, I
weighed it out, and this is a
game of people lying, people
deceiving, people tricking
people, but when your humanity
side is there, you forget all
about that, and you try to do it
according to your friendships,
you know?
 PROBST: So where does
humanity fall in this situation?
When you were making the deal
for the car, you really wanted
the car.
Now it's time to pay back.
It's not so easy.
 Oh, no, it's not easy at all,
because it's a million dollars,
point blank, you know what I
mean?
At the time, I really wanted the
truck, and I still want the
truck.
You know, the truck is
beautiful, and Yau-Man did that
for me.
But he did it out of strategy,
you know?
If I give Yau-Man the idle, I
mean, I go home tonight.
 PROBST: Okay, now, that seems
like a big jump to take.
There are a lot of scenarios
that don't involve you being
voted out.
 I pretty much know if I give
Yau-Man the idol, I'm going to
be voted out, but I'm prepared
for that.
 PROBST: Yau-Man, let's get
you in on this.
Do you and Dreamz talk about
this?
Do you go up and say, "Okay,
what's the deal?
You going to give it to me?
Because I'd like it now."
 No, I just congratulated him
on his win.
I don't think he needs any
encouragement or discouragement
or any meddling on my part, and
I was wasn't going to do any
campaigning.
I left him alone to his own
volition to decide.
 PROBST: What's your gut
telling you, Yau-Man, about
whether or not Dreamz is going
to live up to this part of the
bargain?
 Having known him for just a
short time, my gut feeling is
that he will live up to his
word.
And I don't say that easily for
other people.
 PROBST: Cassandra, what do
you think Dreamz should do?
 Um, Dreamz is in a difficult
situation, and I agree that it
was a gamble, and I really can't
even imagine being in his
situation.
 PROBST: Earl, did you have
any conversation at all with
Dreamz about this?
 No, we all pretty much just
left him alone.
I mean, it's such a difficult
decision to decide between
integrity or the game.
What's your priority?
What matters to you the most as
a person?
 PROBST: What would do you?
 I don't think I would have
been in this situation.
 PROBST: So, Dreamz, your fear
is that if you give Yau-Man the
idol, you'll then turn around
and be voted out.
 I know if I give him the
necklace, I'm gone.
That's just all part of the
game.
But what we didn't know was that
three of us was going to be
talking to the jury.
That's what we didn't know, and
that's what makes everything so
down to the... to the bone,
Jeff.
I can't even explain it.
It's just one of the hardest
things I ever have to do, and it
sucks, Jeff.
 PROBST: Yau-Man, last chance
before we go to the vote to say
anything to Dreamz.
 Well, Dreamz, I hope you
think... thought it over, and I
hope you live up to your word,
but you know, whatever you do,
you have to live with it.
 PROBST: All right, it is time
to get to one of the biggest
votes of this season.
Before we do, Dreamz, you have
the immunity necklace.
It is yours to keep or to assign
to anyone else you want.
What are you going to do with
it?
 I'm going to keep it.
 PROBST: Dreamz is going to
keep the immunity necklace.
You cannot vote for Dreamz.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.
Earl, you're up.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
 PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Cassandra.
Yau-Man.
One vote Cassandra, one vote
Yau-Man.
Yau-Man.
Two votes Yau-Man, one vote
Cassandra, one vote left.
15th person voted out and the
ninth member of our jury, Yau-
Man.
Bring me your torch.
Yau-Man, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
 Good luck.
 PROBST: Well, after 38 days,
you've gone as far as you can go
in this game.
The power now shifts to the
jury.
Tomorrow, they will decide which
one of the three of you they
feel is most deserving of the
million dollars and the title of
sole survivor.
You have one more night here in
Fiji.
Enjoy it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 Well, sorry, Dreamz.
You did not see fit to live up
to your end of the bargain.
Enjoy the truck.
I am very surprised that Earl
voted me out today.
He must have his reasons for it.
I don't understand why, but I'm
glad I could hold my own, and to
make it this far is quite an
accomplishment, and I'm very
proud of it.
 It is a game.
It was just a game.
That's it.
How you feeling, Earl, big Earl,
now?
 I'm good.
 That's right.
Everybody's good.
 That jury is going to rip me
up real nice too.
 They're going to look like I
turned on Yau big time.
Dreamz made a very surprising
decision.
He decided not to give Yau the
immunity idol.
He decided to go back on his
word.
 This ain't nothing like I am
at home.
It hurt me.
It hurt me tonight to have to do
that, but I knew if I didn't do
it, I'd be on the jury right
now, with no chance at all of
winning a million dollars.
 When it all went down, I
actually was pissed.
You know, in the back of my
mind, I said, "Man, I can't
believe I'm actually writing
down Yau-Man's name, who's
trusted me, and I've trusted him
through this whole game."
So that was pretty difficult.
Yau-Man, him and I have been
through a lot, and I would hope
that, you know, on that jury I
still have his vote, that he
won't hold it against me, and he
knows I was just playing the
game.
 Well, we're still here, to
the bloody end.
The decision tonight that I made
with Yau is not going to be
weighing on my mind.
I have no regrets.
I think I did everything the
right way, like I was supposed
to.
I planned it out step by step,
and I have no regrets.
I think everything worked out
perfect.
Like I said, I take it back to
the old concept of it's a game,
and everybody else lied and
cheated and slithered their way
through the game, biting each
other, snakes, rats, weasels.
So it's not going to play on my
mind.
I'm just going to sleep
comfortable tonight, knowing
that I got a shot at a million
dollars tomorrow.
 Day 39, last day, and we're
all still here.
 We're ecstatic.
 Ecstatic.
 Ecstatic, that's our word.
 Ecstatic.
 So I'm putting the smiley
face on now.
We figure by 39, we deserve a
big smile.
We have spent 39 full days in
the same underwear.
 The same funk.
 In the same funk.
I discarded my underwear,
though, about three weeks ago.
 This is the last day on this
island, game over, and I'm
happy.
The plan for today is to relish
in the moment, and we're
celebrating just by being happy.
You know, we don't have a lot of
energy to do cartwheels and
jumping jacks and run around the
island.
We just don't have the energy
for that.
But occasionally we look at each
other and just nod like, "We did
it."
 Food!
 No, it's not.
 A mirage!
 No, it's not.
Ah!
 Whew!
 Whew!
 Whew!
 Day 39.
 Day 39.
 Big deal.
 A pretty big deal.
 "Take a deep breath and sigh,
then use these tools to
celebrate when some gifts fall
from the sky."
Whoo!
 Look it.
 Ooh, yes!
 Right here.
 Over here.
( Cassandra yelling )
 Dreamz, come on!
Dreamz, come on!
Hm.
 He missed the x.
 He's lucky I can't swim.
I'd get out there and get that.
All right, big papa, bring back
the food.
 I'm going to get the food.
I got to feed my family.
 I can't believe, as hungry as
I am, there's some food in the
ocean, floating.
I said they're lucky I can't
swim.
I'd put on those fins, and that
would be here by now.
 Huh?
 I look forward to everything
and the wonderful breakfast
amongst my three... my... what
are we, the three what?
 Amigos.
 Three amigos.
 We're the three amigos.
We were the core four.
Now we're the three amigos.
 So I am feeling really
excited.
We're celebrating, but I just
feel very grateful that I made
it this far.
I made it with some great
people, Earl and Dreamz.
 My mother would be so
embarrassed.
 She will be when she sees it.
 Drinking syrup out of a
champagne glass and eating
strawberry jam right out of the
jar.
 I mean, we're all very
excited and happy to have played
the game and made it through the
game.
After all, I was the one that
couldn't swim, not very
athletic, the older lady.
So I felt initially like odds
were definitely stacked against
me, but I'm still here.
 We turned this mother out.
 We are making an exit bonfire
before we go to tribal council.
All these palm fronds I had to
sleep on, burned.
 Burned.
 All this stuff, burned.
 Burned.
 That log, burned.
 Burned.
 Even this case, this wooden
case with the food in it, even
though that was good, burned.
 Burned.
 Everything gets burned.
 Everything must go.
It's a liquidation sale.
Everything must go.
 It's a fire sale.
 I think being homeless helped
me through this whole situation
of roughing it.
 Yeah, let it burn.
 And actually having a shot at
a million dollars, me, myself,
and how my whole family grew up,
this is more than words can
explain.
It's... it's too... it's just
crazy.
 Somebody's dirty draws.
I don't know who they belong to,
but that's really got to burn.
 Burn.
And now I feel that it's over.
I feel that it's over.
It's the last day.
The struggle is over.
The pain is over.
The game is over.
So right now I feel that I am on
top of the world.
I feel that... I feel like I'm
standing next to Oprah.
 I'm pretty proud of myself
for making it this far.
This is one of the highest peaks
of my life, because I've
challenged myself so much in
this game, and I made it all the
way through, just as planned.
I mean, it's a cool experience.
You won't know until you do it,
till you give up everything and
your lifestyle and come here and
get in the dirt and the mud and
the grind and make it happen,
still be yourself, be strong,
see what you're made of, see if
you're really a man, or a
woman-- the experience of a
lifetime.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
your jury: Rocky, Lisi,
Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie, Alex,
Stacy, Boo, and Yau-Man, voted
out at the last tribal council.
Welcome to your final tribal
council.
You have outlasted 16 other
people in this game.
Now the power in this game
shifts from the three of you
over to the jury.
Nine people that you had a hand
either directly or indirectly in
voting out of this game now hold
your fate in their hands.
Tonight, they will decide who
they think is most deserving of
the title of sole survivor and
the million dollars that goes
with it.
Here's how it's going to work.
You will each get a chance to
make an opening statement.
This is your opportunity to
convince the jury that you are
the person most deserving.
The jury will then get a chance
to address you.
After hearing everything that's
been said, we will get to the
final vote.
Let's get started.
Opening statements.
Earl.
 Um, well, first I want to say
hello, good to see everybody.
About me, I played an honest and
clean game.
I know there's been talk of rats
and snakes in this game, but
that just didn't work for me.
I didn't want to be that.
So I tried to take the hard way,
which is just try to make the
right moves and put myself in
the right position to where I
didn't have to sacrifice a lot
of integrity.
If you think about it, I was
somebody, no one ever wrote my
name down to get voted off, and
I never had to win an immunity
challenge, and I'm here in the
finals.
So I think that says a lot, that
I played a pretty intelligent
game, very smart, and now I'm
here, and hopefully... and you
know, I don't want the sympathy
vote or underdog vote.
I want the respect vote.
You know, I just feel I'm very
deserving of this, and I hope
that you guys feel that way too.
 PROBST: Cassandra.
 Um, I just first want to say
thank you to everyone on the
jury.
I started the game pretty slow,
not really feeling like I was in
the hub of it, but I wanted to
make sure that throughout the
game that I made everyone feel
like they had someone they can
come talk to, that they can
befriend.
And I was fortunate enough to
get with an alliance and stay
firm.
I never wavered.
I tried to stay as positive as
possible throughout the whole
game, and I'm hoping that people
can respect that, and I just
hope, at the end of the day,
that we can all still be
friends.
 PROBST: Dreamz.
 Well, I ain't going to make
this as long.
I'm just going to get to the
point.
I'm sure everybody knows my life
story, because I opened up to
everybody, just to see who would
open back up, not for the game
strategy, because I was, like,
getting to know people.
And the people that I did get to
know, y'all know me.
Y'all know my heart.
Y'all know what I'd do with the
money.
Y'all know everything about me
pretty much, because I wear it
on my chest.
And I hope y'all vote count and
helps me and helps my life and
helps me help other people.
 PROBST: All right, jury, in a
moment, you're going to get your
first chance to address Earl,
Cassandra, and Dreamz.
I'll give you a minute to think
about what you want to say.
 PROBST: Okay, jury, you're
now going to get your first
chance to address Earl,
Cassandra, and Dreamz.
You can address any of them or
all of them.
It's up to you.
Michelle, get us started.
 All right, well, you guys
already made your personal
statements, and after all that,
this is a little bit more
objective.
I was just wondering what you
think was the biggest hardship
and obstacle that you were faced
with, you know, whether it be
sleeping in the dirt or
starving, because I think you
have to work pretty hard for a
million bucks.
So, Dreamz?
 Sleeping in the dirt,
starving, that's really nothing
to me, because I grew up having
to do that.
So that was just something that
I have to repeat in my life.
I think the hardest thing was
thirst.
You know, you could be hungry as
you want to be in the city, but
there's always water somewhere,
out of the... you know what I
mean?-- out of the faucet.
So being thirsty and then having
to do challenges, that was the
hard part for me.
 Okay.
Cassandra, what do you think the
hardest thing that you had to go
through was?
 The biggest obstacle for me
being in Survivor was overcoming
my inability to swim.
For me, that was my biggest
obstacle in the game.
 Do you think your fear of
water earns you a million
dollars?
 You know, the combination of
my fear of water and really
opening myself up to people and
forming an alliance, that was an
obstacle for me, too, initially.
 Okay.
Earl?
 Being the only original Ravu
member up here, everybody who
was at Ravu knows about
suffering-- no water, no food,
and still pushing yourself,
pushing, pushing, pushing.
Then you get sent to Exile
Island, and that's total
suffering.
So I've suffered more than
anybody, I think, as far as
that, but I got through it.
 All right.
Thanks, guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Michelle.
Edgardo.
 All right.
I have one question.
This question is for Earl.
Earl, how do you found out who
had the immunity idol from the
other alliance?
 Dreamz.
 That's it.
 PROBST: Mookie.
 Positive light,
congratulations to you three for
making it this far, first.
Second, Dreamz, did you tell
anyone about the immunity idol
that I found?
 Yes, I did.
 Would you consider that
betrayal?
 No, I'd say it's lying.
 So that's not betraying your
alliance?
Telling the biggest secret of an
alliance to another alliance,
you don't consider that
betrayal?
 Well, if that's how you
consider betrayal, I guess it's
betrayal in your eyes.
To me, it's just a lie.
It's just a con.
It's just a deceit and...
 Okay, okay.
Word of advice for you guys,
tonight is not the time to lie,
and tonight is not the time to
get caught up in a lie.
So just a word of advice for you
guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Mookie.
Alex.
 Okay.
Cassandra, please describe a
moment that you grappled the
most with maintaining your
integrity.
 Um, I think the biggest
struggle I had with my integrity
was once, in the beginning of
the game, I walked in on a
conversation you had with Boo,
where it involved me, and I had
to really decide if I was going
to stay there and listen or if I
would walk away.
 Can you describe to me the
conversation?
 It was basically discussing
eliminating me or Dreamz.
 One of two things is going
on, Cassandra.
One, you're lying to me right
now, and that was not, in fact,
the moment you struggled with
most, or two, you cared very
little, taking Stacy, pretending
to like her, comforting her and
nurturing her to use her vote to
then quickly discard her when
she was no longer of any use to
you, not two votes later.
So which is it?
 Well, basically, I think you
have the situation wrong, and
hopefully Stacy can clarify it.
 Stop, stop, stop, stop.
No, stop, I get to talk.
 You didn't let me finish.
 It doesn't matter, Cassandra.
 Stacy...
 I have enough information.
 No, I think that, you know, I
should be able to respond to
your question.
 No, I think you're mistaken.
You are mistaken, Cassandra.
I said stop talking.
 Well, Stacy came to me, and
she asked me...
 Is that not clear to you,
Cassandra, that I said stop
talking?
Maybe I should say it in
Spanish.
Edgaro, you want to translate?
No, I think we're good.
Stop talking.
On to Dreamz.
Given that you said specifically
your goals are to help kids,
explain to me this, riddle me
this, Dreamz.
You cheat, you lie, you back-
stab to succeed.
Why would the rats and the
snakes be the role models to the
kids you and I are trying to
help?
Explain to me why I would
endorse that view if the world?
 Because it's part of the
game.
This ain't part of the real
world.
This is.. there's two
separations.
This is this game.
This game is based on cons,
lies, and deceit.
The real world, you do that
stuff, and you end up paying the
consequences.
 All right, fair enough.
Well, I would wish you luck, and
unlike you, I'm a man of my
word, so I don't wish you any
luck at all.
 Thank you.
 Can't hide from karma
forever, "my friend."
 PROBST: Lisi, you're up.
 Whew.
All right, let's see.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a
liar by the toe.
If he hollers, let him go-- not
really.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Cassandra, can I see your water
shoes?
 Sure.
 All right, those are the
worst-looking water shoes I've
ever seen.
It's just telling me that you
were completely unprepared to
play this game.
Would you agree with that?
 No, it's day 39, and I'm
still here.
These shoes are still here, and
you know...
 Okay.
 That's all I can say.
I don't see the relevance in the
question.
 I brought up the shoes
because you were in over your
head.
So I'm thinking for 39 days, she
made it because... greed.
I think greed is what really
fueled everything.
Would you agree with that, yes
or no?
 No, I don't agree with that.
I mean, I'm not surprised to
hear that comment from you.
My purpose for being on the
island was to prove some things
to myself.
 So greed never propelled you?
 Greed never propelled me.
 So what did?
What did, your love of the
outdoors?
 Of course wanting to win a
million dollars, like everyone.
 Ah, oh-- what?
 And... but it wasn't that I
sat there every day...
 Say that... say that one more
time.
 We're all here for the
million dollars, but I didn't
think every day of the game I'm
willing to do anything for the
million dollars...
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
We're playing.
 ...which is my definition of
greed.
 We're playing.
Dreamz, I want to know how many
zeroes there are in a million.
 Six, enough to keep
somebody's life running and to
help a lot of people.
 Say that one more time.
 Enough to keep somebody's
life running...
 No, no, the number of zeroes.
 It's six.
 Good, good.
Okay.
 Do you think I'm stupid?
Let me ask you that question.
 No, no.
No, no, hey, it's a question.
I'm part of the jury.
This is part of my game.
 Okay, go ahead.
 Just like you played your
game, and you do what you have
to do with the game, I get that
opportunity too.
Okay, Earl, yesterday, when Yau
got voted off, you did a whole
show for the jury.
I saw it.
You... that did... you gave me
that look, that look, that look
of "Oh, I can't... I can't
believe this has happened."
I want to know why you looked so
shocked after you voted the man
off.
 I was shocked when Dreamz
didn't give up the immunity
idol.
And then that put me in a
situation, and I voted Yau out.
And I just sat there like, "Wow,
Yau is gone.
Like, the person that was there
with me the whole time, he's
gone."
 You could have voted off
Cassandra.
 "We're at that part of the
game."
 You could have vote off
Cassandra.
 ...the game, but I didn't.
It was a choice.
It was a smart choice.
 It's amazing how smart
becomes interchanged with lying
and manipulate.
That's it.
I'm done.
All right.
 PROBST: Stacy.
 Wow, you guys made it 39
days.
Congratulations.
Earl, the only real difference
that I see between you and
Dreamz is that you're a little
more sophisticated.
You're college educated.
Once you leave this game, you're
going to land on both of your
feet.
Dreamz, this could change your
life, you know?
Earl, I want to know whether I
should base my vote on a need
basis or not.
You know what I'm saying?
 We wouldn't even be playing
this game if we didn't all need
a million dollars.
I mean, a million dollars would
change his life, Cassandra's
life, and my life as well.
I mean, I'm not supposed to feel
bad because I have a job.
I'm not supposed to feel bad
because I had a car.
I had a tough upbringing, and I
worked hard.
I was raised by a single mom.
There was drugs in my family.
There was violence.
There was everything.
And that's why I feel like it
shouldn't be based on need.
It's just how you played the
game.
And we all need it.
We all need it.
Does that answer your question?
 Yes.
 PROBST: Thanks, Stacy.
Rocky.
 All right, boys and girls,
this is how it's going to work--
one question, everybody's going
to answer it.
How did you manipulate the best?
Because everyone here did it,
did it a little bit better.
I know some of you are familiar
with my vocabulary.
The word "kicker" is going to
come into play today.
Kicker is a, you know, clutch
player and/or best player.
You answer the question for me:
I am the biggest kicker because
of...
And then we go like that, and on
and on we go.
Cassandra, we don't really know
each other that well.
You're going to go first.
And then, after you'll done,
I'll pick somebody else.
 I'm the biggest kicker
because I feel that I listened
to a person at a time when they
really needed someone to listen
to, someone that they could get
some positive feedback.
 I don't really want to know
about the positive things you
did, the nurturing, the burping,
nothing like that.
I'm going to give you one more
chance.
If you can't do it, I'm going to
go with somebody else, and then
we'll go from there.
So second shot.
 You know, honestly, Rocky, I
don't feel that I've manipulated
a person in this game.
 All right, Dreamz, so same
question.
 I'm the biggest kicker
because I manipulated my way to
the top.
Every time I was on the chopping
block, I was able to turn it
around and put somebody else on
there by laying low for little
while.
I think I manipulated Yau, you
know...
 Obviously.
 ...into keeping me around,
because I was on the chopping
block.
You know, so I had to manipulate
Yau to get his protection.
You understand?
 That was an answer.
You see?
But that was... I mean, that
was... I like that.
My man, Earl.
 I have to be one of the
biggest kickers because I think
I manipulated probably everybody
up there, because no one thought
I was even playing the game.
 That's a decent answer too.
I'm done.
Nice move, brother.
All right, good luck.
 PROBST: Boo, you're up.
 Wipe the smiles off your
face, boys and girls.
First of all, I want to tip my
hat off to this man, Yau.
I think, by far, he was the
greatest all-around player.
He relied on this man's word.
Dreamz didn't come through.
You can't make a promise in your
heart and then say, "Oh, well, I
change it now."
 It wasn't in my heart,
brother.
 Dreamz, I'm speaking.
You will have another chance to
refute what I said.
 Go ahead, go ahead.
 When you made that deal with
Yau, were you playing him as a
game, or did you, as a
Christian-- and I'm coming to
you as this because I believe in
you as a Christian; I want to
know your Christian answer.
Were you playing him when you
accepted that truck, or did you
come back later and say, "You
know what?-- I got to play the
game now; this is my chance"?
 I came here to play the game.
I started getting these friends,
all these new friends, which
really flustered my mind.
I was just happy to be around
people.
So it took my mind off the game
plan.
I wasn't even strategizing.
I was just following people's
strategy.
 Were you playing the game?
 I was playing the game.
 As a Christian man, I want
your Christian word.
 I was playing the game as a
person.
 When you accepted his truck
deal, were you making that as
the game, or were you making
that because you wanted the
truck?
 You don't know.
You don't know what's on the
inside.
I was playing the game.
And either it was going to be me
or him, and I thought about it
right here, sitting in this
chair.
What would everybody else do?
Would everybody else give their
chance up for a million dollars?
 Okay, Dreamz, my opinion, it
was a good try, but I see
straight through it.
And I still believe in you, but
I still believe you're an
immature Christian.
And I hope that one day you will
be a strong Christian man and be
able to tell the devil, "Dangle
all the money you want in front
of me; this Christian is not for
sale."
I just want to say, one more
time, congratulations to each
and every one of you.
 PROBST: Yau-Man.
 First of all, a personal
statement.
Being a 54-year-old man, I have
the advantage of not having
testosterone overload and,
therefore, testosterone poison
the brains.
I can admit to a mistake.
Dreamz, what went down yesterday
was entirely my fault.
The truck was given to you in
good faith.
Enjoy it.
Do not feel guilty about having
it.
 Thank you, Yau-Man.
 So now I'm going to give you
a chance to have the gonads to
stand up and say why you changed
your mind.
 Yau-Man, I didn't change my
mind.
I didn't change my mind.
I was playing the game, Yau-Man.
And you can say it yourself, I
played a heck of a game.
It's outplay, outwit, outlast,
and I think I did that.
Yau-Man, you just... I'm sorry
that you was victim.
 And so when you accepted the
truck, you were basically
playing me at that time.
 But still, Yau-Man...
 And when you shook my hand...
 You remember the whole thing
was a game.
You was the hardest player of
the game, so you should have
never forgot that we were
playing a game-- never forgot
that.
 Understood.
So you are not going to admit
you changed your mind.
 Yau-Man, I would admit it if
I would have changed my mind,
but I came here knowing what I
was going to do.
 Thank you.
Thank you.
 So, Earl, a simple question:
why would you not want to take
me to the next level?
 The reason why I would not
want to go against you, because
I would not win.
 Thank you.
 Because you played the best
game by far.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Yau-Man.
Been a lot said, a lot for you
guys to take in.
Earl, Cassandra, Dreamz, good
luck.
Jury, I'm going to give you a
minute to think about everything
that's been said tonight, and
then we will get to the final
vote.
 PROBST: Okay, jury, tonight
you are voting for a winner.
You are writing down the name of
the person you feel most
deserving of the title of sole
survivor and the million-dollar
check that goes with it.
For the last time, it is time to
vote.
Rocky, you're up.
I'll go get the votes.
Congratulations to all of you
for going as far as you did in
the game.
I know the three of you would
like me to end the suspense
right now and read the votes--
not going to happen.
I'll take the votes with me back
to the States.
We will reveal them there.
See you there.
( cheering and applause )
Hello!
( cheering and applause )
All right!
( cheering and applause )
Let's get to the vote!
Plant it.
( cheering and applause )
No, let's go.
Come on.
Thank you for the welcome.
Let's get to this vote.
These guys have been waiting a
long time.
All right, Earl, Cassandra,
Dreamz, I just said it a second
ago, but I want to say it again,
congratulations on going as far
as you can go in a very
difficult game, a game that
requires you to vote people out
in a way that allows you to then
turn around and come back and
say, "Give me a million bucks."
Not easy to do.
One of you has been successful.
The other two have not.
The jury has made its decision.
Let's find out what it is.
There are nine votes in here.
Tonight, you want to see your
name on the parchment.
These are votes for a winner.
Let's get to it.
First vote...
Earl.
( cheering and applause )
One vote Earl.
Second vote...
( cheering and applause )
Earl.
Two votes Earl.
( cheering and applause )
That's three votes Earl.
( cheering and applause )
Earl.
That's four votes Earl.
Earl, you need just one more
vote.
The winner of Survivor: Fiji...
( cheering and applause )
 Good job, good job.
