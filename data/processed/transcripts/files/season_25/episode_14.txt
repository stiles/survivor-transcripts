"Survivor":
The toughest
and most dangerous
reality competition
of all times
and this season
"Survivor" Phillipines brought back
three players that proved it
Each had been medically evacuated
from their previous previous season.
From "fans versus
favorites," Jonathan Penner.
I got injured in a challenge.
The infection goes into your
bloodstream is potentially fatal.
It was awful.
From season
two, Australia, Michael Skupin.








The world thought me falling in
the fire was my greatest failure.
I didn't see it that way
but I'm in love with the fact
that I'm able to come
out here and do it again.
And Russell swan from
"survivor: Samoa.**
" the last time I played "Survivor"
it smacked me in the chops.
This time I'm smacking back.
In addition to the returning players, the
castaways were joined by two familiar super fans,
former baseball star Jeff Kent.
I played in the world
series with bases loaded.
I've seen pressure.
This is going to be a
challenge for me, no doubt.
And I'm hoping people
won't recognize me.
And former teen TV star Lisa.
I played Blair warner
on "the facts of life.








" Blair would never in a million years be
on "survivor," but I'm very, very different,
and at this point I'm
getting to be just Lisa.
From the beginning these three tribes
were hit by a storm that lasted 21 days.
Come on, rain, stop.
The rain never let up.
Food source were scarce.
I do do anything for food right now.
At least give me hope.
And to make matters worse-- Malcolm and
Denise still struggling out in the water.
Mat sing never won a challenge.
♪♪
After four losses in a row.
I don't get what's happening, farther.
The first returning
player was sent home.
♪♪
Malcolm
and Denise--
you're down to two, you
know what you've got to do--
were the only one to survive.
The unlikely duo had been in
an alliance since day one.
♪♪
Instantly, we just clicked.
And were inseparable until
the game split them up.
Mat sing has been decimated.
Mat sing is no more.
We have two tribes now.
Malcolm goes to Tandang.
Denise goes to Kalabaw.
I'm still holding that trust that it's Malcolm
and I, and the time comes I go back with Malcolm.
at Tandang, Lisa was discovering
the real facts of life.
It's hard being on the outside.
Maybe I'm not able to play this game.
She struggled to fit
in with her young tribe.
She's just, like, an outsider.
I don't trust her.
She's a smart player.
Do not underestimate Lisa.
And her only bond was with Skupin.
Lisa is my closest ally out here.
♪♪
You would have no reason
to think I would lie to you.
- I am your friend.
- Me too.
But if you with me, you're dead.
- ***
- Any chaos I create is going to be beneficial to me.
♪♪
You know what you did?
I didn't do anything.
Stop, don't even try.
Shut--
shut up.
Winning was the only thing that
kept Tandang from fall apart.
And Lisa done does it!Tandang wins!
Tan bang wins immunity by seconds!
At Kalabaw, Jeff Kent led the charge to take out
their tribe 18 returning player, Jonathan Penner.
Do we want a veteran to win
or do we want one of us to win?
I agree.
But Penner's idol and experience
in the game kept him alive.
I have the hidden immunity idol.
I'm going to dance all
the way to the millions.
"congratulations!
The tribes are merging!
Unfortunately for Penner and Kalabaw, they
went into the merge down in numbers.
To our new tribe.
With the tribes merged, Malcolm
and Denise were reunited
while Lisa and Skupin finally
made their alliance official.
♪♪
These two alliances came together.
Final four.
- Final four.
- Final four. Final four.
And were the only constant in the most
unpredictable season "Survivor" has ever seen.
There were blow-ups.
Get him the out of here.
Break-ups.
I can't be in an alliance with
someone who really doesn't trust me.
Breakdowns.
You're pulling yourself out of the game?
I can't stay here.
Blindsides.
Penner.
Jeff.
This game sucks, Jeff.
And things we've never seen before.
36 days later-- the
tribe has spoken--
having beaten all the odds, these
four survivors, two pairs,
one unlikely alliance
are all that remain.
Skupin, one of "survivor's" biggest stars
align with Lisa, America's former teen star.
Lisa's battle the the game and
herself to make it this far.
To play the game, I have to go
against everything that's inside me.
But I'm playing to win.
So bring it on.
Can Skupin keep his game
and Lisa from falling apart?
You you and I are not
guaranteed in the final three.
Second or third that the stage
of the game means nothing to me.
"Survivor" says outwit, outplay, outlast.
There's nothing in there
this says out-keep your word.
Denise and Malcolm, the ultimate
underdogs, in a "Survivor" first,
Denise has gone to every single
tribal council and survived.
I am one it stubborn, determined woman.
The taste of blood is in the water.
I'm going to make it happen.
Malcolm, the golden boy, has played a flawless
game, finding an idol, and dominating challenges.
There's a lot on the line here.
There's no reason to hold back any more.
We're in the home stretch.
It's go big or go home time for me.
But can Denise trust Malcolm's loyalty?
This is it, final three, baby!
Will these powerhouse players
destroy the competition or each other?
It all comes to an end tonight.
Find out who will claim the million-dollar
prize and the title of sole survivor.

I feel like alive.
Oh, don't you?
That's like having a tumor moved.
It was.
Negative gone.
When do we dance?
Now. Ready?
Getting rid of Abi, it's the best feeling
I've had since I've been out here.
It sucked life out of
you having her here.
I have never met
anybody like that before.
I mean, I'm not happy for her loss.
I'm just happy for our peace.
She was just full of fire.
I don't know if I'd call it fire.
Full of... Something.
On the one hand it's a really
good thing that Abi is gone.
The bad news is she
went out with a bang.
Whenever somebody wants to go
out with a bang in this game
they tend to throw me under the
bus with compliments of all things.
"Malcolm will definitely win the game.
Malcolm is a lock if he gets to the end.
" I think they're trying to be nice
but the amount of damage control
I have to keep doing after someone blows
up at tribal council is getting ridiculous.
♪♪
Nothing's changed since two weeks ago.
So no matter what, it's
me and you tomorrow?
Malcolm and I have a
"Survivor" alliance,
but the decision I have to make
for the end game strategy has to be
who I want to sit next
to in the final three.
There is a feeling that
Malcolm's the runaway.
Abi sees it that way.
Lisa sees it that way.
I don't see it that way.
I believe I have a
better story than he has.
I have to step outside the game for just a
minute and look at it from an outside observer
in order to truly make
the decision on that.
***
Tree mail!
We got something going on.
Okay.
- Oh, no.
- What?
No way.
"winning this next challenge
will be worthy of your bragin'.
We'll have a better shot at the money
when you've finished off the dragon.
" is that reward or immunity?
We never know.
No.
Oh, we have a challenge today
which we weren't expecting.
My fear is I will be the next one to go.
We've had this solid four but four can't
go to three so I am desperate to win it
because one of us is going to get the short end of
the stick, and I definitely don't want it to be me.
Come on in, guys.
Four people left.
Malcolm, how you doing?
I'm good.
You know, you knowledge about this for so
long, even before we hit the beach on day one,
and to actually get
here now, it's exciting.
But it's not over yet.
You guys ready to get to
today's reward challenge?
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
For today's challenge, you will
race through a series of obstacles.
Collecting bags along the way.
Once you have all three bags, you will
use the pieces to solve a dragon puzzle.
Do you want to know
what you're playing for.
Absolute! Yes.
It is the biggest reward of the game.
The winner of today's challenge wins an advantage
in the final immunity challenge tomorrow.
For 37 days, you have battled
with one goal in mind--
getting to the end for
a shot at the money.
Winning today's challenge
could mean the difference
between sitting in the final tribal council
or being the eighth and final jury member.
Big stakes.
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.
Here we go.
For an advantage in the final
immunity challenge, survivors ready?
Go!
Everybody gets across
the balance beam quickly.
Malcolm and Skupin
over the bamboo first.
Lisa and Denise right behind.
Everybody off to a very fast start.
Everybody working on their knots now.
That first bag of pieces, once you're
untied make your way through the bamboo.
Denise whipping through these knots.
Skupin's untied.
Malcolm is untied.
Lisa's now untied.
Keep moving!
Three people through.
Lisa going up top and
it's taking a lot longer.
Malcolm falls off.
He's got to go back.
Lisa's through now.
She's in it.
Everybody working on that second bag.
There are three bags total.
Skupin has his second bag.
Skupin heading for that
third and final bag.
Denise has hers untied.
Malcolm has his second bag.
He's across.
Lisa still struggling.
Malcolm up the rope quickly.
Denise up the rope.
Here comes Lisa.
Everybody working on
their third and final bag.
Skupin has his. He's down first.
Denise right behind.
Start working on that puzzle.
Malcolm's there now.
Lisa has her third bag.
She's heading down.
Everybody working on their puzzle.
We're building a dragon in this puzzle.
Everybody fighting for a huge reward.
Advantage in the next
immunity challenge.
This could be a million-dollar
challenge right here.
Denise off to a fast start.
Skupin trying to figure it out.
Denise with another piece.
Lisa with a piece.
Malcolm with another piece.
Denise in the the lead right now.
Lisa now starting to pick up the pace.
She places another piece.
Skupin struggling all over the place.
Pieces falling out.
Denise making a lot of headway.
Malcolm with another piece.
Lisa still fighting.
Skupin out of it right now.
It would be so nice to have an advantage
in that final immunity challenge.
Historically advantages have worked out
very well for the people who have them.
Quite often it results in a victory.
It is Malcolm and Denise fighting for an
advantage in the final immunity challenge.
It is very close.
Lisa falling out of it.
Skupin's been out of it.
Malcolm now places another piece.
And another.
And another.
He has four pieces left.
Denise trying to catch up.
Malcolm is very close.
Malcolm wins reward, an advantage
in the final immunity challenge.
Malcolm, come on over.
Advantage in the final
immunity challenge.
It is sealed. Keep it that way.
You'll reveal the
contents at the challenge.
Could have been a
million-dollar victory today.
- Hopefully
- Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
See you guys tomorrow for
your final immunity challenge.
***
♪♪
- ***
- " exhausted after that.
You are good at puzzles.
Dang it!
Nicely done.
We did not need Malcolm
winning an immunity advantage.
He was already a huge threat to win.
Just on his own.
So it was going to be an uphill
climb just battling Malcolm.
Now battling Malcolm with an advantage.
Forget it.
Good challenge.
Today, I managed to pull it out.
I won some sort of advantage in the the
final immunity challenge which is huge.
It's the last challenge, and at this
point I'll take any advantage I can get.
All right, I need to get water.
You want to go up there?
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Everything is going exactly as I plan.
I have the final three
deal with Lisa and Skupin.
I think I can beat them at the end.
I absolutely think I could beat Denise at the end, but
she's the hardest person to beat for me right now.
Her story is similar to mine.
The people from th the tribe that
was wiped out made it to the end.
I feel bad for her but I need to go to
the final three with people I can beat.
***You know that.
♪♪
My heart is still in my
chest going like this.
I know, but you-- you have a huge
shot at winning immunity tomorrow.
I know you're still thing, but
we need to solidify three.
I'll make my proposal for me.
I want to be in that final three.
Are you willing to
commit at all with me?
Or at the very least make it a tie
so Lisa and I have to make fire?
Well, no, just make a
decision and just go with it.
I'm definitely over-thinking it but I won't
do this to you because I know I'm being awful.
I tried to approach Malcolm about going
to the final three together,
and he's just very hesitant to make
any kind of commitment, so for me,
knowing he had planned so
hard to make sure we had a six,
and planned tow hard to
make sure we had a four,
makes me very leery about his thoughts
on keeping me in the final three.
So this is kind of scramble time.
I need to figure out a
plan and figure it out fast.
I haven't gotten an opportunity
just to talk to either of you.
And so I wanted to feel you because
I don't know where Malcolm's head is.
I'm getting flash backs to Penner.
Like,"Malcolm, are you able to make
any commitment for final three?
" "we've got time.
We don't need to worry
about that yet, jungle mom.
" and I'm like, that's
all I need to know.
I'm so glad to hear
you talking like this.
I thought you
were like this--
we have been but strategically
he has votes all over the jury.
He has the physical game.
He has the social game.
If you guys are on board, it is possible.
Perfect.
Today has been a good day.
I just found out Denise is willing to turn on
Malcolm and go to the final three with Mike and me.
She realizes she doesn't
have a chance against him.
None of us do.
So this is fabulous.
Malcolm is the kind of guy who will
put his arm around you, and stab you.
Stab you.
Then visit you at the
hospital the next day.
And you get out of the hospital and saying,"was
that the sweetest thing for him to come visit.
He's such a nice guy!
Absolutely.
We all have better odds together up there
versus let's just let him do a clean sweep.
- Yeah. Absolutely
- .Okay. Okay.
So good to hear you thinking like this.
I hugged her, big hug.
Didn't shake her hand.
Didn't give her my word because I don't know
what Skupin is going to think about this.
So I talked to Lisa and
I'm voting for Malcolm.
- 100%.
- Really?
Yeah, she's like,"I'm
so relieved." all right,
I just want to go cool off and clean up.
Yeah, enjoy.
I will. Thank you!
Denise was thrilled
with your conversation.
Great, me, too.
You and I need to get off and decide
definitely which way we want to go.
Because at this point, I'm leaning
toward going to the end with Denise.
Lisa and I have a pact with Malcolm
to go into the final three together,
but now it looks like we have
the same deal with Denise,
which is great because either way
Lisa is I will be in the final three
with one of those two, depending
on who wins immunity.
If she wins tomorrow, then what?
I can't even imagine a scenario
where Malcolm doesn't win immunity.
But you know what I was thinking?
In the physical challenge I
beat Malcolm today to the puzzle.
I beat him in every physical challenge.
So I can beat him.
I'm not saying I will.
I'm saying I think I can beat him.
You know, the word on the
street is Malcolm's unbeatable,
and he makes it to the final three, it's
a landslide, he'll get every vote.
I don't know.
I think I can beat Malcolm.
And I think I can tell a
pretty good story at the end.
So I just have to keep my cool and figure
out who I want to sit next to in the finally
because that's the million-dollar
question right there.
***
♪♪This is going to be a crazy day.
Denise is really working it, right?
We can't control jury votes
but we can control where we sit.
So we just can't let her win.
- She hasn't won anything-- what
do you mean we can't let her win.
We have to let her win.
She's the one we have a
better chance of beating.
She hasn't played the game.
She let Malcolm play for her.
I used to hate it when Abi said
I need to keep Mike on a leash
but I think you need to be level headed
to be able to make strategic moves,
and sometimes Skupin is
not that level headed.
Realistically, we can't
let either one of them win.
Right.
Then we control the outcome of what
happens in the final part of the game.
Right.
Lisa and I are not on the same page
as far as who sits in the final three,
and who that last person is on the jury.
So if I want to control
the outcome of the game,
I have to have immunity in my hand so I can create the
final three instead of just falling into the final three.
Tree mail.
"congratulations final four.
You are almost at the end.
Follow the map to the head land.
There you will find the
torches of your fallen comrades.
At each torch you will collect a representative
name plate of those voted out before you,
pay respect to each their memories as they
each had a part in getting you to this point.
You will then head to your
final immunity challenge.
" that's a fun day.
Very cool.
That's a big one.
Tree mail was bigger than usual.
We are going to do the
fallen comrades today,
where you pay respects to everyone
who has fallen before you in the game.
It's a cool thing to take the time and go remember them
one last time before the blood starts flowing tonight.
Zane.
Was a crazy guy.
He quit smoking days
before he came out here,
gained 30 pounds, was also
one of the funniest guys.
Appeared to be a little insane.
Put it that way.
I think it was very stupid
for my tribe to vote me out.
That made a move way
too early in the game.
In hindsight, you know
hindsight is 20-20.
as you can see, my whole
tribe folded after I left.
Oh, Roxy.
I think Rox would have to be one of the
people with the strongest convictions
about her beliefs
that I have ever known.
She was a fighter. She was a fighter.
I keep it real and that could have been
my downfall, keeping it real too much
gets you out sometimes, but I was
just myself, and I'm proud of it.
Oh, Angie.
Angie was my sleeping buddy.
You know what?She turned out to be a
lot tougher than we all judged her to be.
Poor girl, all she
wanted was some cookies.
A girl after my own heart!
Being ditsy or bubbly, whatever.
That's just part of who I am.
I'm not a dumb blond bum I'm not
serious all the time or hard core.
I'm kind of well-rounded, I feel like.
Russell.
the leader, came in saying,"I
don't want to be the leader, guys,"
but he just couldn't help it.
He wanted to win this game so bad.
A cog taijous enemy around camp.
And he was the first
returning player to go.
I came back out here to win this thing.
However, we got our butts kicked, worst
tribe ever in the "Survivor" history
and to go out four
straight humiliations.
Dana.
I think she could have
been a great competitor,
but her body just wouldn't
let her stay in it.
I can speak on her behalf, being
med-evaced from this game,
it just leaves a little hole inside.
I definitely think I had
the heart for the game,
and I think at the end it was all heart,
but I just don't think I
could have went on any longer.
You can only do what you can do.
Oh, Dawson. Dawson was another very
lively addition to the game of "survivor.
" a little quirky.
A little out there, but definitely
entertainment that I think Kalabaw needed.
I played too passively.
That's my biggest regret.
But having Jeff Probst snuff my torch, I
can't tell you how much I was salivating.
I just wanted to put a wet
one so far up on his lips.
It was a moment he and I shared.
And I'll never be the same.
Katie, great competitor.
Wasn't afraid to strategize.
A little bit of a potty
mouth, which I loved.
I really liked Katie, but, unfortunately, she
had to go so I could stay.
So thank you, Katie.
The only time I've ever
camped is with girl scouts,
so the fact that I stuck it out
for 16 days is, like, huge to me.
RC,my first alliance in the game,30
seconds into this game, RC Was all over it.
Unfortunately, the extreme methods of her playing became
so obvious to everybody, she instantly became a threat.
I sort of was oftrasights because
I took my clue and the idol,
and then turned everyone against me.
You know, you win some, you lose
some. I'm not really used to losing.
Jeff. Sorry to see him go.
He was a good player.
He was the one that wanted
returning players gone the most.
Great, great athlete.
I played baseball with some of the
most spoiled brats you ever met.
Maybe I was one of them at times.
But I'm proud of the fact that
I have been able to get through
this game without pissing
a lot of people off.
Artis.
Very, very loyal to the Tandang tribe.
I think almost loyal to a fault.
Tandang was capable of literally
annihilating the other two tribes,
so I'm disappointed that my tribe couldn't stay
together and do what was tailor made for us to do.
Pete. Stuck with Abi
through thick and thin,
and it was that which really, really
bit him in the butt in the end.
I'm definitely proud
of the game they played.
I wanted to be in control.
And most of the game I was in control.
The turning point in the game
was I kept Abi for way too long.
I really disliked her from
day one, but she had the idol.
I had to stick with her, and I
just made the wrong decision.
Penner.
Entertainment on steroids.
Great strategic player.
Nobody wanted to sit next to him.
No. In the find three because
we knew he could create a speech
that would have knocked
everyone's socks of.
I love "Survivor" and I've been one
of the luckiest few people in the world
to have gotten three
opportunities to play this.
I regret nothing.
I've left everything on the field.
You know, I gave blood, sweat, and
tears for this game.
And I hold my head
up high at this point.
When I met Carter, I saw a
young man become a man out here.
And his physical strength and his personal character
is the reason we had to write his name down.
I was who I said I was.
I work hard and I developed solid
relationships with people out here.
It's unfortunate, un, that it
couldn't have got me farther.
Abi. Our little Brazilian firecracker.
Tumultuous and tenacious.
I'm say this for the girl-- as much
as everyone wants her gone for so long,
to make it to fifth place
is pretty impressive.
I was genuinely surprised that
people didn't like me so much.
I learned a lot from that experience.
And still went home fighting
and with my head up high.
All right.
Got it?
Okay.
There it goes.
Watch the puppy burn.
Come on in, guys!
And now it comes down to this.
One final immunity challenge.
Shall we get to it.
Yes. Yes.
First things first, Malcolm. I
gotta take it back.
For the last time, immunity
back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you each have a wooden
cylinder that has been cut into several pieces.
On my go, you'll pick up the
first piece using two handles.
Your goal-- balance a ball
on your center piece of wood.
Every five minutes we'll add more pieces
making it more difficult to balance the ball.
If at any point the ball falls off the
piece of wood you're out of the challenge.
Your shot at immunity is over.
Last person left standing wins immunity, guarantees
themselves a spot at the final tribal council
where you will get to plead your case
about why you deserve the million dollars.
Losers go to tribal council, where one of
you will become the final member jury.
At the last reward challenge, Malcolm, you
battled and won an advantage in this challenge.
And he doesn't need it.
"you are allowed a second chance
in this final immunity challenge.
Should you drop the ball at any
point, you are not out of the challenge
but will replace the
ball and start again.
" that means one second chance.
If at any point, Malcolm drops his ball, he gets
one free shot to put it back on and keep going.
All right, take your spots.
We'll get started.
All right, here we go.
Pickup your handles.
What you're going to do is put
both sides of the handle against
that first piece of wood and pick it up.
All right, in three, two, one, pick it up.
And this challenge is on.
All you have to do is
keep that ball balanced.
Simple little backyard game
could be worth a million bucks.
Everybody looks really solid right now.
All you have to do is survive another 30
seconds, and you are safe in this round.
Malcolm with a little bit of a wobble.
A good recovery.
10 seconds left.
Five, four, three, two, one, everybody safe.
Set down your ball. Relax your hands.
All right.
We're going to add two more
pieces of wood, one on either side.
Go ahead and grab them and place them.
This round will be more difficult.
All right.
Pick up your handles.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, lift.
This challenge is back on.
Three pieces of wood now.
A lot longer throw.
Hard tore keep it balanced.
Malcolm with an advantage.
If his ball drops he gets a free reset.
Skupin a little bit of the jitters.
Denise, nice adjustment.
Lisa rock solid.
Malcolm drops his ball.
He is not out of the challenge.
He has a second shot.
Everybody, set your balls
down, and we will reset.
Malcolm's advantage
will now come into play.
This is his one opportunity
for a second shot.
And now we resume this round.
Everybody put your handles on the wood.
Here we go.
In five, four, three, two, one.
We are back on.
Malcolm's second shot has
kept him in this challenge.
Now everybody is on the same page.
Your ball drops, you're out, that's it.
Go home.
Everybody very solid.
Except Malcolm.
That ball still moving around.
Arms shaking.
Malcolm flirting with
disaster, but still alive.
Calm your body.
Malcolm with another amazing recovery.
Ball is almost hopping
it's moving so much.
Just like that, Malcolm is out of
this challenge, no shot at immunity.
His fate in this game will now
rest in somebody else's hands.
Malcolm had an advantage, it gave him
a second shot, and it didn't matter.
He's still the first person
out of this challenge.
One minute left.
We move to the next round.
Skupin very steady.
Lisa steady.
Denise steady.
Denise, good recovery.
30 seconds.
Denise drops her ball.
Denise is out of this challenge.
Now we are down to two.
10 seconds left in this round.
Five, four, three, two, one.
You are both safe. Set
down your balls and relax.
Skupin and Lisa survive another round.
Move on to round three.
Two more blocks of wood had been added.
It will become much more difficult.
Come on, Skup.
Grab your handles, here we
go, three, two, one, and lift.
This challenge is back on.
This could be the
final round right here.
We are down to Lisa and Skupin battling
for the final immunity necklace.
***
30 seconds left in this round.
Dig deep right now.
30 seconds.
Keep it together for 30 seconds.
Lisa with a tiny wobble.
Lisa starting to wobble a little more.
Still have 10 seconds
left in this round.
She's got to hang on.
Five, four, three, two, one.
You're both safe. Drop your balls.
Nice job, guys.
Good job, Lisa.
We move on to the next round.
We will place two more pieces now, making
this very long, very tough to balance.
Here we go.
Pick up your handles.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Lift.
And this challenge is back on.
Skupin or Lisa will go to tribal
council tonight wearing the necklace.
Very big decision at tonight's tribal.
You want to be the one in charge.
You're in a danger zone now.
Any movement can knock that ball off.
Skupin adjusting.
Something's not
working, change something up.
Change your breathing.
Change your focus.
A little bit of movement in Lisa.
That's about it.
Don't think about
anything, nothing, nothing, nothing but this.
This is it right here.
Balancing that little ball on these pieces of
wood is all you should be thinking about right now.
Lisa drops her ball.
Skupin wins final immunity.
Guaranteed a spot in
the final tribal council.
After returning to a game
he played 12 years ago.
Skupin will get a chance
to finish what he started.
Congratulations.
We made it together.
Skupin, come on over.
Skupin, safe at tonight's
final tribal council.
I never thought I'd hear you say that.
You are there.
You are say safe in this game.
You have gone as far as you can go.
Tonight, tribal council.
You're good to go.
Malcolm, Lisa, Denise, after
38 days in the Philippines,
one person will become the
final member of our jury,
the other two will join Skupin
at the final tribal council.
I can't wait to hear
how this afternoon goes.
I'll see you all tonight
at tribal council.
Congrats.
***
Great job.
Awesome.
Thank you.
You guys did, oh, my gosh.
Good try, man.
You tried.
I just have shaky hands.
The advantage would
have had to have been,
"Malcolm, you automatically
win" for me to put that off.
I needed to win the immunity challenge
to guarantee my spot for the final three
but the minute I get nervous around a
girl or anything my hands start shaking
and when I saw my hands shaking
it got worse and worse and worse.
It's a disconcerting scenario because
my fate now rests with Lisa and Skupin.
You beat him.
Right when we needed it.
I can't believe I did it.
This win means I made to
the very, very, very end.
And what I'm most proud of is the fact they
all said the same thing, Malcolm is going to win.
It turns out it was not even close.
Mr. Skupin, well done.
Yeah.
Now there's a ton of strategy.
Who do you keep?
Who do you put on the jury?
Can you get their vote?
And it's up to me to make that decision.
We're all cool, yes?
I'm so scared.
I've had a necklace for the past week.
And I don't have one.
She's going to want you
all to throw votes at me.
Should we just go along
with her and say yeah?
- No!
- No, no, I'm saying to say it.
If we're all good, I don't care.
This is the first time in a long time in
this game I haven't been calling the shots.
Hopefully, I've strategized well
enough to where it doesn't matter.
I have an oath from Lisa and Skupin that
they're with me, that Denise is going home.
But people are out here playing
a game for a million dollars,
and if they get any crazy ideas I could
be in for a nasty surprise tonight.
Is this a good opportunity.
I'm still on board.
Are we still good?
It's really.
You know Lisa and I are tight, right.
I know. And it's our decision
between you and Malcolm.
Absolutely.
So, obviously, if you're on board
with us, then it's three to one.
Then it's three to one.
If we decide to go with
Malcolm, then, obviously, you're gone.
I'll be gone.
I know, so my plan will be Malcolm with
the hopes that you two stay on that.
I mean, I'm 100% on that.
You would be silly.
- 100%.
- To do anything else.
I am so mad.
Malcolm and I could have stayed
together and split the vote,
have it be a tie, but now
that's not going to happen.
So my head is clearly
on the block tonight.
You will write Malcolm's name down.
It's guaranteed.
The problem is Skupin is
kind of the dreamer guy.
His mind is going a thousand different places
and he may not always see the repercussions.
What happens if you take the best
of the best of the best to the end.
So I have to figure on the a way to convince
him that it's worth it to take me with them.
I'm one stubborn, determined woman.
And if I can make it happen, I'm
going to make it happen.
What are you thinking, dude?
You know, there's a weird, instinctive, primitive
side of me that says go against the best.
Go against the best.
- Go against the best.
- I know.
Is there honor in beating
Malcolm over beating you or Lisa?
Is there any honor in that?
I mean, there is to some
extent, but will it happen?
And is that a risk that's
worth taking, knowing--
if the jury votes with Malcolm, is
there honor beating him?
My fear is we won't.
The obvious choice is vote Malcolm out.
That seems like the obvious.
But when it comes right down to
it, I would love to take Malcolm
and beat him straight up man to
man, two warriors, fought to a head.
He won three individual challenges.
I won three individual challenges.
What a great head-to-head
battle that would be.
I have a respect for the two of you.
I just feel this friendship
with you and Lisa.
I'm getting all chocked up.
I swear to god, it's not a ploy.
This is no ploy.
I really care about both of you,
and whatever you decide I will
respect, whatever you both decide.
I feel there are friendships that have
formed out here that will supersede this game.
Malcolm and I may have had an alliance,
but there's a difference between
that and a true friendship.
But this is also a game, and you have
to figure out what's best for you guys,
but you know where I'm voting.
Wow, it's such a big decision.
It is.
I just heard your comrade out,
all the reasons why she
should come instead of you.
She's such a sweetheart.
Right now I haven't decided
who I'm going to keep yet.
I am strongly considering
keeping Malcolm.
You know, my wife said to me as I was
walking out the door, make us proud of you.
" and I would love to get to the
final three by keeping my word,
and being honorable, and come the final
vote, have her say,"you made us proud.
" you know, I've told you how I feel.
Why don't you tell me
about what you're thinking?
Right now.
I think it's Malcolm in the finals.
Tonight, we can either bring Malcolm
or Denise to the final three.
Assuming Michael and I will vote together, which is
a big assumption because Skupin is a wild card here.
-**
-**
He's good at that.
Handing the title of sole survivor on a
platter to Malcolm would just be stupid.
Everybody who signed up to
play this game came to win.
And I did, too.
So after what I've been through, I'll do whatever it
takes to make sure Malcolm is not in the final three.
We'll now bring in the
members of our jury.
RC Jeff. Artis.
Pete. Penner. Carter.
And Abi, voted out at
the last tribal council.
So,38 days, one spot left in the jury, three
spots at the final tribal council.
Skupin, how big a factor are
alliances at this point in the game?
I mean, it's a part of the game that gets
you going and gets you through the mid-game
and gets you to the end
game, and it's always a factor.
You have to weigh out everything.
Denise, does it have any impact that you
and Malcolm started this game together
and Skupe and I know Lisa
started this game together?
Absolutely.
You can look at those alliances
from the start, and is there a loyalty
that you hope will take
you into that final three?
Do you look at new alliances that were
formed with the four that got us here?
And you're looking
at each layer of that.
You know, the strategy, the
loyalty, the alliances.
I mean, it's a great place to be but
it definitely doesn't get any easier.
Malcolm, given
how you started--
you and Denise losing, losing, losing, and
you get split up and somehow you survive.
There's clearly some sort of loyalty
to Denise but it's been complicated.
Yeah, the story lines gets intertwined.
Everything gets mixed up.
