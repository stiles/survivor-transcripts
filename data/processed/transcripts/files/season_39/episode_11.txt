Beautiful afternoon.
For the eight of you, grab your
Stuff, head out, enjoy the
Afternoon.
incredible.
karishma, is this
Potentially a defining moment in
The game?
yes.
It sucks to feel that you're at
The bottom and it sucks when you
Have that moment of clarity, and
I feel for anybody who has that
Moment because I know how it
Feels.
Moving forward, let's all ban
Together.
We can put a wrecking ball to
Somebody else's head maybe.
wow.
Emotion
 yeah.
Let's go.
elaine, dean,
Karishma, noura, grab your
I got nothing for you.
Head back to camp.
guys, I just want to say, I
Love you guys.
to win the family visit, it
Was like a shot of energy.
And seeing john and holding him,
It was absolutely awesome.
He's my rock.
You know?
isn't it crazy?
it has no idea.
seeing nicole, I just
Couldn't help but feel that love
And feel that warmth of home.
I became one of my little fourth
Grade girls and I even started
Shaking.
There's so much riding on.
This it's my job to get this
Done.
loved one, we don't want to
Talk strategy, but we have to.
Who is first?
I think elaine.
I think elaine.
why don't we tell noura?
split the vote between
Karishma and elaine?
once again to have our army
Against this rag-tag group of
Losers.
I'm not afraid of this weird
Grouping.
dan, tommy, janet, and myself
Are in an alliance, and the
Other four are back at camp.
So they have the chance to put a
Plan together.
However, we have noura, who
Always tells everyone I'm her
Number one, and then there's
Elaine, who is not a strategist.
And we have dean, who is a
Numbers guy, who is desperate.
Then we have karishma, who
Everyone is mad at.
Do they have the numbers?
No.
Can they do something?
Maybe.
Is it likely?
No.
I want to say something, and
Can we talk?
I'm the only vokai that's here
With you dwois right now.
I have been loyal to these
People since the beginning.
I have shown my allegiance.
Now I know where I rank in that
Group, I am in a way the
Karishma, but I'm actually
Enjoyable to be around.
I'm funny, I'm providing.
I'm cutting coconuts.
I give up reward so they can eat
And kill me today
you're their bitch.
I'm their bitch.
this family business has
People revved up.
The one who felt it the moist is
Noura.
She came back guns ablazing.
I came over here.
I was willing to bring our
Numbers back together, and
Lauren and tommy flipped over.
Dan, I was like, where's the
Love, man?
What happened to this?
noura was very vocal about
How upset she was.
There was airing of grievances.
Call it festivus.
There was an airing of
Grievances going on.
I am honest and loyal to
Fault, and here's the fault.
Here's the fault.
I was blindsided.
Not blindsided.
It bunched punched me in the
Face.
Kellee's, I have all these
Plans.
And lauren, since day one, she
Doesn't do... They're ego
Maniac.
They want to be like, look what
I did, look what I did?
None of us want to be a pawn in
Their game and be someone who
Got them to the end.
And today I'm going to fast
Forward to the future and go
Back and finish up, for me, it
Was wonderful.
when there's a high emotional
Moment, people tend to tell the
Truth.
We can literally control the
Next vote, because I will be
With you guys, and I'm a very
Transparent player.
With me, I take people to insane
Levels.
I literally uplift someone to a
Point where he's rocking and he
Goes back to his ex-and I'm
Disposed of even though I go
Back to him.
noura, you're getting side
Tracked.
the point where my surrender
Flag.
I'm inch I'm all the way in.
I'm not just saying.
This I want you to understand.
I am here with you.
I am here with you, elaine.
I am here with you, karishma.
We have to make a move.
They think it's going to be like
This, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
that was music to my ears to
See someone of a group I thought
Was so strong go against them.
what scares me the most is
Lauren has tommy wrapped around
Her finger.
we all know lauren is a big
Threat because she's very social
And she's most threatening in my
Book.
Are you willing to vote her out?
yes, I am.
Because I'm being played by
Them.
maybe it's time for me to
Wake up and say, dan and tommy
Don't have you in their final
Plan, because now would be my
Time to hop off that bus and get
On with the underlings and rise
On up.
what can we do?
what that said, there's only
Four of us, and there are four
Other people, so we drag in a
Fifth or we go out and find a
Hidden immunity idol and go
Create our own luck.
I don't think it will be
Buried.
I'm thinking like we know, and I
Know an idol is back in play.
Two were played, at least one,
Was found in this jungle.
what does it look like?
it's blue, this big.
there is the thing call the
Very tick lar activating system,
If you say blue, blue, blue, it
Will activate our brains.
If you say it, we'll see it.
I know these idols are looking
The help us.
this is blue.
we're not going to have to
Dig and make so it hard.
It's going to be literally like
A gift.
Here you go.
boom!
you did it.
look what I found.
I found one.
There it was, sitting in the
Tree.
Pretty as can be.
I picked it up and put it in my
Red nick pocket.
And that's where it's going to
Stay until I play the damn
Thing.
I see it clearly.
Now I have to make my move, and
My sister said it, this is my
Crazy noura.
She always finds a way.
And my family knows that.
I am the epitome of "Survivor"
In my own life because the
Biggest, this is where it comes
To a close, the biggest obstacle
In my life has been me.
Am I going to be a sheep until
The end?
I'm not.
That's not who I am.
And that's why the game is going
To change today.
let's open a papaya.
yes!
come on in, guys!
All right.
First things first, got to take
Back the necklace.
Once again, noura.
Are you even going to turn
Around?
now I will.
Thank you, jeff.
once again, immunity
Is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you're
Going to stand on the small
Block of wood while stabilizing
A ball against an overhanging
Piece of wood.
If at any point the ball drops,
You're out.
Last person left standing wins
Immunity, guaranteed a one in
Seven shot of getting to the
End.
Losers tribal council where
Somebody will be voted out and
Become the seventh member of our
Jury.
Draw for spots.
We'll get started.
All right.
Everybody get on one foot.
Put the ball in the paint.
Grab both handles.
An we look good.
This challenge is on.
At this point everybody knows
The game is up for grabs.
Nobody can be totally certain
They're okay.
But that necklace solves that
Problem.
Now sooner do I say that, dean
Is first out.
No shot at imhuntty.
Tommy drops.
He'll have no shot at immunity.
He's not safe at tribal.
Noura drops.
She will not get a third
Immunity necklace.
She's out.
We're down the five.
Janet drops.
You all right?
yeah.
you sure?
yeah.
okay.
Janet with hard tumble, but gets
Up like a weeble wobble.
Janet with hard tumble, but gets
Up like a weeble wobble.
Karishma drops.
She's out.
Karishma has no security at
Tribal council tonight.
We're down to lauren, dan, and
Elaine for immunity on day 32.
oh, god, I looked away.
I looked away.
I looked away.
dan drops.
We're down to two.
It is lauren versus elaine for
Immunity.
elaine!
this is it, another
Showdown on "Survivor" right
Here.
Coming up on 15 minutes in this
Challenge.
I want that necklace, jeff.
earn it right here.
keep your focus on the ball.
elaine knows how good
It feels.
I want that necklace.
focus on the ball.
that's it.
You got the breathe through it
Sometimes.
keep focused.
You're good.
You're both good.
elaine still looking
Very good down on the end.
Not much movement at all.
Not much movement at all.
Elaine still very solid.
my arms.
rest them against the
Ball.
Don't look away.
Don't look away.
lauren starting to
Struggle.
Got to get it back.
do not look away.
That's what killed me.
lauren struggling
Again.
Can she recover for a second
Time?
Elaine drops suddenly.
are you kidding me?
lauren wins
Individual immunity.
I won?
you won!
Lauren pulls it out.
Once that ball dropped, we knew
Our easy target tonight,
Karishma, can go home.
congratulations.
anything can happen, but
Everyone wants her out, and
Tonight is the night that can
Get that done.
lauren.
you did really good.
You should be so proud of
Yourself.
thank you.
I'm is happy to have this
Necklace on.
That's something that I've
Dreamed of doing since I was 11.
That is 18 years of dreaming, of
Having this on my neck.
And I have it.
I don't know if I needed it
Tonight, because I'm confident
In my alliance right now.
But this vote is one of the most
Important votes of the game.
okay.
So the idea for tonight is...
tommy, dean, me and you are
Voting together.
the strategy moving forward
Is to get the cat with nine
Lives out, which is karishma.
So we're going to put four votes
On karishma and three votes on
Elaine in case karishma found an
Idol again an we're feeling
Relatively confident because we
Don't feel like this motley
Anti-alliance has really
Assembled their forces in any
Real way.
long story short, you, me,
And dan are voting elaine.
And the rest on karishma.
that's smart.
janet told me their plan, but
After the loved ones visit and
Not getting the go on the
Reward, I felt on the bottom.
They're all in it together,
Tommy, janet, dan, lauren,
They're a strong four.
This is like lord of if flies.
They can promise you the stars
And the moon, and wine and dine
You and make you feel great, and
Then they're going to fricking
Get you.
karishma needs to go because
We can't keep dragging her
Along.
The closer she gets to the end,
The more we'll all start
Thinking we want to sit next to
Karishma.
this is a really big vote.
But it feels cool that I get so
Much power in it.
okay.
They came up to me.
It was me and janet.
This is how they're doing the
Vote.
Janet and dan are going on you.
And she has something.
And tommy and lauren are doing
Karishma.
perfect.
that means the four of us can
Vote whoever we want.
this is gold.
I know that four still want me
Out, but if they decide to split
The vote, the four of us can
Decide who goes home.
This is the break I've been
Waiting for.
All it takes is one tribal
Council for everything to
Change.
If they're doing 2-2, we have to
Put our entire four on one
Person.
all four on tommy.
unless you're told different.
everybody is voting for
Tommy.
okay.
Great.
noura, final four.
we're doing it.
we wanted to vote lauren out
Today, but she won immunity, so
The backup is tommy, because
That's her right-hand man.
It's going to work.
My concern is that noura is such
A fruit loop that she won't
Stick to the plan.
me, dan, and janet voting
Elaine, and you and elaine and
Everyone else karishma some that
Makes technically only 2-2.
but what if tommy has an
Idol.
What if 3-1
 no, not at all.
you don't think so?
one vote is not doing
Anything.
well, duh.
But then what if karishma goes?
karishma is not going.
but what if elaine doesn't
Play it?
good.
look, we found the idol.
You think there's twoné
That's absurd.
We can't plan for every little
Thing.
That's when we start going
Crazy.
I agree.
So I want the rule this out in
My mind.
So if we 
 holy crap.
Noura is totally confused.
She can't even think through
Numbers straight.
Like, noura, it's easy.
Two is more than one, but no.
what if we did three on tommy
And one let's say dan.
we would do 2-2-1.
well, all right, so you're
Thinking it has to be all tommy.
four tommy.
and we have to trust
Everybody.
I do.
you're not worried about
Karishma?
I feel very good.
I am most worried about you?
really?
yeah.
noura is a loose cannon.
It's a very simple plan, but the
Way she was thinking through
Things, putting my faith in
Noura's hands is scary.
okay.
I'm sitting in the middle and we
Have been told to vote like
This.
Karishma, karishma, karishma,
Karishma.
Noura.
if noura isn't with us right
Now 
if noura flips.
They have four.
And that means whoever they pick
Goes home.
right.
if we get through tonight
With karishma or elaine going
Home, we're sitting pretty.
But the one thing that could
Really mess that up was noura.
Noura has been a wild card since
Day one.
She's very like spur of the
Moment, goes with the flow, and
If she does something crazy, I
Don't have an idol.
I don't have a necklace.
I could be going home.
so what do we do for real?
we definitely want karishma.
but now is just crazy.
it's a tricky situation.
And all it takes is one little
Wrong decision.
And it's over.
Your dream is dead.
if we do this, there's no
Turning back.
I got an idol in my pocket.
I don't know if I should play
It, but my lesson from boston
Rob and sandra was don't
Hesitate.
When you see an opportunity,
Seize it.
I'm going to go balls out and
See if I can make this move.
Go big or go home.
we'll now bring in
The members of our jury.
All right.
So let's start with the loved
One challenge.
Januaryet, when you dream of
Playing "Survivor," one of the
Moments you think about is, and
Then I'll be there long enough
For my loved one to get.
There you had that moment.
it was absolutely amazing.
The best part was like energy
That just fills you up.
karishma, the down
Side of winning the loved one
Reward challenge is you are
Playing with "Survivor"
Dynamite.
You win, you get love.
You live people behind that
Don't.
yeah, it is definitely
"Survivor" dynamite.
I mean, there's four people left
Back at camp all sharing the
Misery of heartbreak and misery
Loves company, so that could be
The dynamite that explodes in
Someone's face.
lairng let's
Extrapolate.
what's extrapolate mean?
you want a consistent game
Plan.
this is how I played the
Game.
From start to finish.
I had a goal.
And this is what I did.
If it served me well great, if
It didn't, great.
elaine russia you
Concerned at all that since we
Sat down, it's been whispering.
apparently they got something
To say.
look at this.
tommy, tommy, I need to talk
To you right now.
I'm sorry.
to be on the bottom, they're
Trying to bring you in and vote
You out.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Listen,
 are you voting for me.
I don't understand what's
Happening.
I'll be outspoken.
I'll say it right now.
I'll make it very clear and then
We don't have to do all this
Whispering.
Dean, since the day I met you at
Liar york you've shown me not
Once, not twice, three times I
Can't trust you.
Look, dean, elaine, and
Karishma, they're on the bottom,
They're trying to get in with
Our group, and I would actually
Consider leaving my crew to go
With you?
You're telling me come with us,
Let's do this ruse?
Now it's 110% never.
but what is the ruse?

Being dizzy, not only in this
