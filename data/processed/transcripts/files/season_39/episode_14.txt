        [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELCOME TO THE
"SURVIVOR: ISLAND OF THE IDOLS"
REUNION SHOW WHERE TOMMY HAS
JUST WON OUR 39th SEASON.
AND THE $1 MILLION.
TOMMY, ONE OF THE REALLY COOL
THINGS ABOUT WATCHING YOU PLAY
IS YOU WERE VERY OPEN IN SAYING
INFORMATION WAS MY GAME.
KNOWING STUFF.
WALK US THROUGH THAT.
 I ACTUALLY FELL KIND OF LIKE
A KINGPIN.
EVERYONE WAS TELLING ME
EVERYTHING.
I'M NOT TRYING TO SOUND COCKY,
BUT I WAS OPEN AND REAL WITH








PEOPLE.
WHEN YOU'RE REAL WITH PEOPLE,
THEY'RE REAL WITH YOU.
PEOPLE WERE TELLING ME THEY
FOUND AN IDOL, THEY FOUND AN
ADVANTAGE.
 SANDRA, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU
CAN TEACH A "SURVIVOR" PLAYER OR
IS THAT AN INSTINCTUAL SOCIAL
THING
 NO, HE HAS TO HAVE THIS IN
HIM.
WHEN WE WERE IN THE ELEVATOR,
I'M LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU TELL
DEAN YOU FOUND THE CLUE.
HE SAID, I'M COLORBLIND, BUT HE
KEPT ON TELLING HIM, I SAID, IF
COW HAD COME TO ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS, YOU DON'T TELL DEAN OR
ANYBODY ANYTHING.
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS.
HE DIDN'T NEED IT.








 Jeff: LET'S GET TO STEP
TWO, WHAT YOU NEED WITH THE
INFORMATION.
YOU BETRAYED AND SLAYED.
YOU BETRAYED JANET BY TELLING
JEEP.
YOU BETRAYED NOURA BY SAYING, I
CAN'T DO FIRE.
YOU BETRAYED LAUREN BY TEACHING
DEAN THE MAKE FIRE.
YOU'RE MAKING FRIENDSHIPS WHILE
THIS IS HAPPENING.
ANY REMORSE?
 I'LL BE AS HONEST AS I CAN.
I LOVE THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE MY
BEST FRIENDS, THEY'RE MY
SISTERS, THEY'RE EVERYTHING TO
ME, BUT WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED,
I SAID I WASN'T PLAYING TO MAKE
BEST FRIENDS.
I GOT BEST FRIENDS AND THEY WERE
GREAT ABOUT IT, BUT I WAS
PLAYING TO WIN THIS $1 MILLION.
I WAS PLAYING TO WIN FOR MY
FAMILY, FOR MY STUDENTS BACK
HOME.
I LOVE YOU ALL MY CLASS 4-D.
I HAVE ONE STUDENT OUT THERE
TODAY.
I'M SO EXCITED TO TAKE IT HOME
TO THEM AND SAY SORRY LATER.
 Jeff: YOU'RE SITTING NEXT
TO TWO PEOPLE WHO PLAYED VERY
SIMILAR GAMES.
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."
 THIS IS "SURVIVOR."
THE ONE THING I'LL GIVE TOMMY
CREDIT FOR, EVEN THOUGH HE
DIDN'T COME TO THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS, EVERYBODY ELSE THAT DID
COME THERE, THEY ALL SAID THAT
TOMMY WAS THEIR RIDE OR DIE.
TOMMY WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE.
THEY WERE IN WITH TOMMY.
SO HE WAS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT
FROM THE BEGINNING.
 AND I TOLD HIM THAT.
I SAID, ONE THING THAT ALWAYS
KEPT COMING UP WAS, I'M WITH
TOMMY.
I'M LIKE, DAMN, EVERYBODY'S WITH
TOMMY.
BUT IT'S TRUE.
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE NO REGRETS.
THAT'S GOOD.
 Jeff: DEAN, GREAT
FOURTH-QUARTER SURGE, AS AARON
SAID, HE LIKED YOUR GAME, AND
YOU AND ALL YOUR JEWELRY.
BUT WHAT WAS A POSITIVE TAKE
AWAY, OUTSIDE OF THE GAME, JUST
FOR YOU AS A GUY WHO WAS OUT
THERE?
 YEAH, I CAN REALLY SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT IT WAS THE BEST
LIFE EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE OF THE
GAME PLAY I'VE EVER EVER HAD.
IT LITERALLY STRIPS YOU DOWN
FROM TECHNOLOGY, FROM FAMILY,
FROM FOOD, FROM SHELTER, FROM
EVERYTHING, AND THERE ARE
MOMENTS OUT THERE WHERE I HIT MY
LOWEST OF LOWS.
IT TAUGHT ME SERIOUSLY AND THIS
IS GOING TO SOUND CORNY, BUT TO
JUST BE GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING
THAT WE DO HAVE IN OUR FAMILIES
AND A SIMPLE ROOF OVER OUR HEADS
AND A GRANOLA BAR.
 Jeff: NOURA, YOU WERE --
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT?
AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE
POINT OF MY QUESTION.
FOR ALL OF YOUR CRAZY
UNPREDICTABLE, YOU WERE
CONSISTENT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
WHAT IS THE CONFIRMATION FOR
YOU?
OR TO ANYBODY WHO PEOPLE LOOK AT
AND SAY, YOU'RE A LITTLE
PECULIAR IN TERMS OF EMBRACE
YOUR UNIQUENESS.
 IF YOU FOLLOW THE HERD,
YOU'LL NEVER BE HEARD, SO I FEEL
I WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME MY
WAY.
WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM THE
LEGEND, BUT YOU NEED TO BE YOUR
OWN LEGEND, THE ONLY WAY TO DO
THAT IS TO BE YOU.
IT'S THE HARDEST JOB IN THE
WORLD, AN YOU HAVE TO DO IT DAY
IN AND DAY OUT.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.
SO MY POINT IS STICK OUT, STAND
OUT, BE A PEACOCK.
BE A PEACOCK.
 Jeff: THAT'S NOURA.
 GO FOR IT.
BE YOU!
DO YOU!
 WELL SAID, NOURA.
 Jeff: SPEAKING OF SOMEBODY
WHO STOOD OUT, EVERY SO OFTEN
THERE IS A PL)Y+j THAT COMES
AROUND THIS INSTANTLY CAPTURES
THE HEART OF A FEIGN, ELAINE,
SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS.
TAKE A LOOK.
 WHAT?
I'M 5'2", A LITTLE BUSTED CAN OF
BISCUITS.
EVERYBODY UNDERESTIMATES ME
BECAUSE OF MY SIZE.
I HAVE THE HEART OF A LION AND
I'M STRONG LIKE AN OX.
 ELAINE WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
 CAN I HAVE THE HUG FIRST?
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT.
 I'M GOING TO PLAY THE HERO
AND RIDE IN ON MY STALLION AND
SAVE THE DAY FOR MY PEEPS.
 I LIKE STEAK.
YUM, YUM, YUM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
S THAT MY FAMILY.
 Jeff: ELAINE
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ONE OF THE REASONS
PEOPLE ADORED YOU SO MUCH IS YOU
WERE OPEN AN YOU WERE REALLY
VULNERABLE, AND YOU SAID AT ONE
POINT, THIS IS THE JOURNEY OF
THE SOUL, I NEEDED THIS.
DID IT DELIVER WHAT YOU NEEDED?
 YEAH.
IT DID.
1,000%.
I COME OUT SEARCHING FOR
SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST A
CHECK TO TAKE HOME, WHICH I
NEED, BY THE WAY, BUT I WAS
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING ELSE
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING I WAS
GOING THROUGH, AND IT LITERALLY
GAVE ME WHAT I NEEDED AND MORE.
I ALWAYS SAY, GOD ALWAYS GIVES
YOU WHAT YOU NEED, NOT WHAT YOU
WANT.
I THOUGHT I NEEDED $1 MILLION,
BUT HE GAVE ME SO MUCH MORE.
I'M BLESSED AND GRATEFUL FOR
PLAYING.
 Jeff: KARISHMA, ONE OF THE
MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS OF ANY
SHOW WE'VE DONE IS THE SIMPLE
HUG YOU HAD WITH YOUR HUSBAND,
BECAUSE WE SAW IT ALL.
WE SAW YOU BEING ON THE OUTSIDE.
WE SAW HOW MUCH YOU TRUSTED THIS
PERSON WHO WAS THERE FOR YOU.
TELL ME ABOUT WHAT WAS THAT IN A
BIGGER PICTURE, WHAT DID YOU
TAKE AWAY FROM THAT MOMENT?
 YEAH, COMING INTO THIS GAME,
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO HAVE A
TOUGH TIME WITH THE ELEMENTS AND
THE ATHLETICISM, BUT WHAT I
DIDN'T EXPECT IS HOW DIFFICULT
THE SOCIAL GAME WAS FOR ME.
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THE
EMOTIONAL TURMOIL THAT COMES
FROM FEELING NOT ACCEPTED FOR
WHO YOU ARE.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN
YOU REACH THOSE INCREDIBLE
LEVELS OF LONELINESS, YOU'RE
REMINDED OF THE FRIENDS YOU HAVE
AT HOME, THE FAMILY YOU HAVE AT
HOME AND THE PERSON WHO CHOOSES
TO BE WITH YOU AND GIVES YOU THE
HUG THAT YOU NEED MORE THAN
FOOD, MORE THAN SHELTER, MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
AND IT JUST REMINDS YOU TO
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE AT HOME
AND NEVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU
DON'T HAVE.
JUST FOCUS ON WHAT YOU DO
ANDERSON CHOOSE HAPPINESS EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
WELL, JACK AND JAMAL AND THE DO
RAG WAS ONE OF THE MOST TALKED
ABOUT SCENES OF ANY SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."
HERE'S A REMINDER.
 THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO
APOLOGIZE.
 YEAH, THANK YOU FOR DOING SO.
JACK'S APOLOGY TO ME KIND OF
LIKE MADE UP FOR A LOT OF TIMES
WHEN I'VE HAD TO FEEL SO
INSIGNIFICANT AND LET IT ROLL
OFF MY SHOULDERS FOR MY OWN
SOCIAL MOBILITY.
SO THAT APOLOGY, MAN, I'LL
REMEMBER THAT FOR THE REST OF MY
LIFE.
 Jeff: JAMAL, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO
ME IS THAT WHAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
IS THAT JACK, WHO COULDN'T BE
HERE TONIGHT, WAS OPEN IN
SAYING, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
IT, AND I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT I DID, WILL YOU TEACH
ME.
AN YOU, INSTEAD OF EXPLODING OR
TAKING THE MOMENT, YOU SAID, I'D
LOVE TO, AND WHAT RESULTED WAS
THIS BEAUTIFUL THING.
WHAT IS THE RESPONSE THEN FOR
YOU FROM PEOPLE.
 YEAH, THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN
AMAZING.
THE WAY THAT THAT HAS STARTED SO
MANY AMAZING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
RACE, ABOUT DIFFERENCE, ABOUT
LANGUAGE, ABOUT THE WAY WE TREAT
EACH OTHER HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL,
BUT I WANT TO DEFINITELY
HIGHLIGHT THAT JACK IS AMAZING.
LIKE HE ANDRY BOYS.
WE ACTUALLY REMAIN BACK IN RHODE
ISLAND, WE LIVE TOGETHER NOW.
GOOD DUDE.
BUT THAT'S THE POINT.
HE AND I HAD A FRIENDSHIP OUT
THERE WHICH IS REALLY RARE TO
FIND OUT THERE ON "SURVIVOR."
AND INSIDE OF THAT FRIENDSHIP IS
HOW YOU CAN HAVE THOSE HARD
CONVERSATIONS.
SO TO CONTINUE THAT KIND OF
CHANGE TO, CONTINUE BEING BETTER
TO EACH OTHER, WE HAVE TO BE
BETTER TO EACH OTHER AND RELATED
TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE THAT
FOUNDATION.
AND YOU CAN HAVE THOSE MOMENTS
WHERE THERE IS HARM CAUSED AND
YOU CAN TALK IT THROUGH.
 Jeff: YOU ARE SO GOOD IN
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.
THANK YOU.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO ONE OF
MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THE A
FINALE, BECAUSE IT IS SO WEIRD,
UNLESS YOU'RE A NEW FAN, THEN
YOU KNOW THAT EVERY SEASON SIA,
THE INTERNATIONAL ICONIC
ONE-NAME POP STAR AND PROLIFIC
SONGWRITER AWARDS HER FAVORITE
PLAYER WITH THE SIA GIFT, IT'S
CASH.
IT'S HER CASH.
AND SIA'S PHILOSOPHY IS I HAVE
BEEN BLESSED IN MY LIFE BEYOND
ANYTHING I THOUGHT I WOULD EVER
HAVE.
I LOVE "SURVIVOR."
I WANT TO REWARD THE PEOPLE WHO
MAKE THIS SHOW SO FUN.
SO ONCE AGAIN IT'S CHRISTMAS FOR
THREE PEOPLE, THREE.
WE HAVE A NEW COMPETITION.
JAMAL, ON BEHALF OF SIA, SHE
WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOU WITH
$15,000.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ELAINE.
 ME?
 Jeff: YOU.
BUSTED CAN OF BISCUITS.
SIA WOULD LIKE TO GIFT YOU
$100,000.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND WE HAVE ONE MORE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND WE HAVE ONE MORE.
SIA WOULD ALSO LIKE TO GIFT
$100,000 TO JANET.
AN SHE WANTED ME TO TELL
EVERYBODY IT'S HER BIRTHDAY GIFT
TO HERSELF.
SHE'S AT HOME WATCHING.
WHILE THEY CELEBRATE, WE'RE
GOING THE TAKE A BREAK, AND WHEN
WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING TO SIT
DOWN WITH KELLEE.
AN WE'RE GOING THE TALK ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH
HER AND DAN.
THIS IS HER FIRST CHANCE TO
SPEAK.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.
AN WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS INTO
A POSITIVE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
REUNION SHOW FOR "SURVIVOR:
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."
THIS SEASON HAD A LOT.
THERE WAS SOME GREAT GAME PLAY,
SOME VERY FUN PLAYERS.
ALSO PROVIDED SOME GREAT
TEACHING MOMENTS.
WE HAD TALK OF HOW A WOMEN'S
ALLIANCE IS FEARED YET NOBODY
ANYBODY MENTIONED A MEN'S
ALLIANCE WHICH IS MUCH MORE
COMMON.
MISSY POINTED OUT THAT MISSY AND
AARON BOTH WON IMMUNITY AT THE
SAME CHALLENGE, TWO BLACK
PLAYERS.
AN WE TALKED ABOUT RACE
RELATIONS WITH JACK AND JAMAL.
WE ALSO HAD DAN'S UNWANTED
TOUCHING OF KELLEE.
IT WAS A VERY COMPLEX,
UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION FOR US,
AND THE STEPS THAT WE TOOK IF
THE GAME TO ADDRESS THE
SITUATION WERE MADE BY A GROUP
OF DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN
ACROSS TIME ZONES IN REAL TIME.
AN WE INTENDED TO DO THE RIGHT
THING.
BUT IN THE MONTHS THAT HAVE
PASSING WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE AND
SHOULD HAVE DONE INSTEAD, AND IF
THIS HAPPENED TODAY, WE WOULD
HANDLE IT MUCH DIFFERENTLY.
WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IMPORTANT
STEPS TO LAY OUT NEW POLICIES,
PROCEDURES, RULES, AND METHODS
FOR REPORTING THAT WILL CREATE A
BETTER AND SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR
FUTURE PLAYERS.
WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING OUR
PART TO TURN THIS INTO SOMETHING
POSITIVE.
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF KELLY, THE
WOMAN WHO WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO
SPEAK UP, DESPITE THE RISKS.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR KELLEE TO
FINALLY GET A CHANCE TO HAVE HER
VOICE HEARD, BECAUSE DUE TO THE
CRAZY FORMAT OF "SURVIVOR," IF
YOU'RE A JURY MEMBER, YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO TALK SOME KELLEE,
IRONICALLY, IS THE ONLY ONE WHO
STILL HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHARE
HER THOUGHTS.
BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WANT TO SAY
TO YOU, YOU WERE RIGHT.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
YOU WERE RIGHT TO SPEAK UP.
YOU WERE RIGHT TO STEP FORWARD,
DESPITE A LOT OF RISK, AND TO
SPEAK YOUR TRUTH, AND I WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE AND APOLOGIZE FOR
YOUR PAIN.
YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.
AND YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT.
I WOULD LIKE NOW TURN IT OVER TO
YOU TO VENT AT ME TO, SHARE WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED TO, SHARE YOUR
FEELINGS, BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO TALK.
 I AM VERY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.
I JUST... THERE'S IS MUCH
PRESSURE ON THIS MOMENT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN BUILDING
UP FOR MANY, MANY, MAéy¦ MONTHS,
AND I JUST FEEL A LOT OF
PRESSURE TO DO RIGHT BY NOT ONLY
MY OWN VOICE, BUT TO THE VOICES
OF MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE
EXPERIENCED THIS OR REACHED OUT
ME AND SHARED THEIR STORIES OF
INAPPROPRIATE TOUCH, SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULTED,
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND ALL THE
THINGS THAT COME AFTER THAT.
AND SO I FEEL VERY NERVOUS ABOUT
IT.
 Phil:
 Jeff: LET ME HELP.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
GET OFF YOUR CHEST THAT YOU'RE
UPSET ABOUT WITH ME OR
PRODUCTION THAT YOU WANT ME TO
HEAR?
 I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT HAS BEEN AND WAS THE
HARDEST THING WAS THE FACT THAT
DAN REMAINED IN THE GAME EVEN
AFTER I SPOKE UP.
THE REASON WHY IS NOT
NECESSARILY THE INJUSTICE, IT'S
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I SPOKE UP
AND I WAS NOT BEING SUPPORTED OR
BELIEVED.
AND WHEN SOMEONE GOES THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR ANYTHING
REMOTELY LIKE IT, TO NOT BE
SUPPORTED AND NOT BE BELIEVED IS
REALLY THE HARDEST THING.
IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS.
AND SO --.
 Jeff: LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST
HIT ON I THINK IS PROBABLY THE
BIGGEST PACKAGE OF WHAT WE
LEARNED IN A NUTD SHELL.
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR EMOTIONAL
INTERVIEW, THAT DID PROMPT US
INTO ACTION.
I GOT ON THE PHONE WITH CBS.
IT'S A 15-HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE.
EVERYBODY WAS IN.
WE WERE TRYING THE MADE THE
RIGHT DECISION.
WE MADE A DECISION TO MEET WITH
YOU PRIVATELY.
WE WEREN'T TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHY
WE MET.
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT I
HAVE LEARNED.
WE COULD HAVE SAID, HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
BUT WHAT WE LEARNED IS A FEW
PEOPLE TOLD US IN THOSE MEETINGS
THEY KNEW IT WAS DAN, AND THEY
KNEW DAN WASN'T GOING TO GET ANY
VOTES, THAT DAN WAS GOING TO GO
TO THE END BECAUSE DAN COULDN'T
WIN.
THERE WAS ALL THIS TALK OF
PLAYERS USING IT TO LIE IN THE
GAME, AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS
WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS, YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR
DECISIONS OF HOW TO HANDLE IT
BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF SOMEBODY
IN IT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN.
MISSY AND ELIZABETH GOT A LOT OF
REALLY UNFORTUNATE SOCIAL MEDIA
HATE MAIL THAT THEY DIDN'T
DESERVE.
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS EITHER.
NONE OF YOU ASKED FOR THIS,
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO THE
THING I SAID AT THE TOP.
YOUR VOICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH.
AND THE SILVER LINING, ONE
SILVER LINING IS IT WILL NEXT
TIME.
WE LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU BEING
WILLING THE STAND UP AND TAKE IT
AND CONTINUE TO TRY THE PLAY.
 I DON'T WANT THE LIE.
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A HARD
SITUATION.
AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT ASK FOR
MY "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE TO BE
DEFINED BY THIS OR ABOUT THIS,
AND REALLY NO ONE IS SITTING UP
HERE HAD ASKED THEIR "SURVIVOR"
EXPERIENCE TO BE DEFINED BY
THIS.
AND WE CAN'T REALLY GO BACK AND
CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND
WHAT HAPPENED TO, YOU KNOW, ALL
THESE OTHER PEOPLE, BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, IT WASN'T JUST ME, IT WAS
ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD
CHOICES THAT WERE SPEAKING UP IN
DIFFERENT WAYS.
PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES ARE
READY TO SPEAK UP IN DIFFERENT
WAYS.
SOMETIMES SOMEONE HIGH NOT BE
READY TO SPEAK UP IN THE WAY
THAT I SPOKE UP.
EVEN THOUGH I WAS READY THE
SPEAK UP, IT WAS STILL
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN I
THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION AND
WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT I HOPE
THAT THIS SEASON OF SURVIVOR
ISN'T JUST DEFINED BY
INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.
I HOPE THAT IT'S DEFINED BY
CHANGE, YOU KNOW, AND I FEEL
LIKE I CAN BE REALLY PROUD OF
THE FACT THAT I SPOKE UP AND I
ASKED FOR THESE CHANGES AND CBS
AND "SURVIVOR" ARE MAKING THOSE
CHANGES BECAUSE I ASKED.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO
FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE AT THE
END OF THE DAY THAT INDIVIDUALS
AND INSTITUTIONS ARE CAPABLE OF
CHANGE.
AND I THINK THAT AS A RESULT OF
THIS SEASON, MANY OF US HAVE HAD
THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS.
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT.
AND I THINK WE'RE STILL
LEARNING.
AND ULTIMATELY MY BIGGEST HOPE
IS THAT EACH ONE OF US, EACH
INDIVIDUAL, EACH INSTITUTION,
EACH ORGANIZATION, AND
ESPECIALLY CBS AND SURVIVOR CAN
TAKE THIS, LEARN FROM IT, AND DO
BETTER.
YOU KNOW, I FUNDAMENTALLY
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO BETTER.
 Phil: WE ARE COMMITTED TO
IT, KELLEE.
I WOULD LOVE YOUR INSIEPGHTS AS
A PLAYER AND I JUST WANT TO SAY,
I APPRECIATE, I CAN FEEL HOWER
NERVOUS YOU ARE RIGHT NOW AND
YOU FEEL PRESSURE.
I FEEL LIKE YOU EXPRESSED
YOURSELF REALLY WELL.
YOU CONTINUE TO BE A GENERALIOUS
GREAT SPOKESPERSON.
AND NOT ONLY WILL CBS AND
"SURVIVOR" CHANGE AND MAYBE LEAD
THE WAY WITH OTHER SIMILAR
SHOWS, BUT I KNOW THERE ARE
FAMILIES WATCHING RIGHT NOW THAT
ARE SEEING YOU AND ABLE TO SAY
TO THEIR KIDS, WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THIS.
WE ALL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE'S A LOT TO THIS.
SO I OFFER MY HAND IN
PARTNERSHIP AND I SAY THANK YOU
SO MUCH, KELLEE.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
MORE OF OUR REUNION SHOW,
INCLUDING WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT
YEAR WHEN WE COME BACK.
 Jeff: "SURVIVOR" FIRST
