 --- 

         Jeff: AFTER 29 SEASONS AND
15 YEARS, "SURVIVOR," THE GREAT
ET
EST SOCIAL EXPERIMENT ON
TELEVISION, IS ONCE AGAIN
BREAKING THE MOLD.
THESE 18 AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
DIVIDED INTO THREE TRIBES BASED
ON THEIR OCCUPATION AND APPROACH
TO LIFE.
THE WHITE-COLLAR TRIBE, MADE UP








OF A YAHOO EXECUTIVE, A MEDIA
CONSULTANT AND FORMER COLLEGE
PROFESSOR AND A RETAIL BUYER.
THEY'RE USED TO BEING IN CHARGE
AND CALLING THE SHOTS TO GET
WHAT THEY WANT.
 I'M A BUYER FOR A MAJOR
DEPARTMENT STORE.
I AM DEMANDING.
I'VE MADE PRETTY MUCH EVERY
PERSON THAT'S EVER WORKED FOR ME
CRY AT ONE POINT.
I GUESS I'M THE DEVIL, YEAH.
 AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR, I








TAUGHT A CLASS ON "SURVIVOR."
THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS IN MY
LIFE THAT I'VE SET MY MIND TO
THAT I HAVEN'T ACHIEVED BECAUSE
I STEP ON THE PEOPLE WHOSE
ASSISTANCE I NEED TO GET TO THAT
NEXT PLATEAU.
 IN CORPORATE AMERICA, I'VE
WORKED IN SOME HARD-CORE
COMPANIES.
EVERYBODY WANTS YOUR JOB, AND
IT'S THE SAME THING ON
"SURVIVOR."
EVERYONE'S GOING FOR THE SAME
GOAL.
GAME ON, BABY.
HERE IT IS!
 Jeff: THE BLUE-COLLAR
TRIBE, THIS GROUP IS MADE UP OF
A STATE TROOPER, A BARREL RACER
AND A POSTAL WORKER.
THEY'RE USED TO HARD WORK AND
PHYSICAL LABOR AND AREN'T AFRAID
TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY TO GET
THE JOB DONE.
 I WORK IN THE OIL AND GAS
INDUSTRY.
I'M NORMALLY THE ONE THAT IS
COVERED THE MOST IN OIL, COVERED
THE MOST IN MUD.
SAME THING WITH THIS GAME.
IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR HANDS
DIRTY, YOU AIN'T GOING TO WIN.
MY HANDS ARE GOING TO BE FILTHY.
 I'M A SINGLE MOM AND I'M A
HAIR STYLIST.
HAVING A LITTLE GIRL IS HARD,
BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.
MENTALLY, THERE'S NO ONE ON THIS
EARTH WHO IS AS STRONG AS I AM.
 I'VE WORKED FOR THE POST
OFFICE FOR 22 YEARS.
I AM HERE TO LIVE MY DREAM.
I HAVE DREAMT ABOUT BEING ON
"SURVIVOR" SINCE SEASON ONE,
EPISODE ONE.
I PLAN ON BEING REMEMBERED, ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER, YOU WILL NOT
FORGET ME.
 Jeff: THE NO-COLLAR TRIBE.
THIS GROUP INCLUDES A SAILING
INSTRUCTOR, A YOUTUBE SENSATION
AND A COCONUT VENDOR.
THEY USE THEIR FREE SPIRIT
MENTALITY TO FURTHER THEMSELVES
IN LIFE.
 I'M A SEARCHER.
I'M AN ADVENTURER.
I FLY BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS.
I DO WHAT I WANT TO DO WHEN I
WANT TO DO IT.
OF COURSE I WANT $1 MILLION.
MONEY MAKES LIFE EASIER.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN UNHAPPY
PERSON ON A JET-SKI?
NO.
 WHEN PEOPLE HEAR I'M IN LAW
SCHOOL, THEY PROBABLY ASSUME I'M
A CORPORATE DOG-EAT-DOG GIRL.
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.
I'M IN IT FOR THE POOR,
BROKEN-DOWN PEOPLE.
I'M IN THE ANARCHY.
I'M THE GREATER GOOD.
 AS A COCONUT VENDOR, I SEEK
TRUTH.
I'M A SEER OF REAL.
I LIVE LIFE IN A WAY WHERE I'M
GUIDED BY MY OWN DECISIONS.
THERE ARE JUST NO RULES FOR ME.
MY PERSONALITY IS A LOT LIKE
SURFING A WAVE.
LET ME SURF FOR A SECOND.
 Jeff: IT IS THE ULTIMATE
CHALLENGE.
WHITE COLLAR VERSUS BLUE COLLAR
VERSUS NO COLLAR.
 I ALWAYS WANT TO BE THE GUY
IN CHARGE, AND I'M HERE TO WIN
$1 MILLION.
 FAST MONEY, LOOSE WOMEN, LOTS
OF CHAMPAGNE.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK I'M A
THREAT.
I WANT THEM TO THINK I'M HERE TO
ENJOY THE BEACHES.
NO, I WANT TO BEAT YOU IN
"SURVIVOR."
 Jeff: WHICH WAY OF LIFE
WILL PROVE TO BE MOST VALUABLE?
 PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND THINK
I'M A MEAT HEAD.
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETITION,
I'M FILET MIGNON AND THEY'RE A
BUNCH OF STEAK 'EMS.
 Jeff: IN THE END, ONLY ONE
WILL REMAIN TO CREATE THE PRIZE.
 NEW IT'S GAME ON.
 Jeff: 39 DAY, 18 PEOPLE,
ONE SURVIVOR!
 AS A "SURVIVOR" FAN, THIS IS
MY LIFE'S DREAM.
I WANTED TO BE ON "SURVIVOR"
SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.
TEN YEARS OF APPLYING, AND YET I
HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER PREPARED
TO PLAY THIS GAME.
 THIS IS INSANE.
 Bianca: WELCOME TO
"SURVIVOR: WORLDS APART."
[CHEERING]
 Bianca: YOU HAVE BEEN
DIVIDED
 Jeff: YOU HAVE BEEN DIVIDED
INTO THREE GROUPS BASED ON
PROFESSION AND LIFE.
THE QUESTION IS: WHICH OF THESE
GROUPS IS BEST SUITED TO THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."
YELLOW, YOU'RE THE WHITE-COLLAR
TRIBE.
PROFESSIONALLY YOU'RE IN A
POSITION OF AUTHORITY.
YOUR APPROACH TO LIFE IS
SIMILAR.
YOU LIKE CALLING THE SHOTS AND
BEING IN CHARGE.
WHITE COLLARS TEND TO MAKE THE
RULES.
IN THE BACK IN THE MIDDLE,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 TYLER.
 Jeff: TYLER, RING TRUE FOR
YOU?
THE IDEA OF OFFICE ENVIRONMENT,
SOME AUTHORITY?
 TYPICALLY.
I ENJOY SETTING TEAM GOALS, AND
USUALLY THE BEST WAY TO SEE
THOSE THROUGH IS TO TAKE THE
LEAD.
 I WORK IN ARGUABLY THE
LARGEST AND MOST CUT-THROAT
TALENT AGENCY IN ALL THE WORLD.
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL BE
ANY PROBLEM GOING FROM THE URBAN
JUNGLE TO THE ACTUAL JUNGLE.
 Jeff: BLUE, YOU ARE
FITTINGLY BLUE COLLAR.
PROFESSIONALLY YOU'RE USUALLY
PHYSICALLY INVOLVED IN YOUR
WORK, MEANING YOU ARE EARNING IT
EVERY DAY.
YOU DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE RULES.
MORE TIMES THAN NOT YOU'RE
FOLLOWING RULES THAT HAVE BEEN
SET BY SOMEONE ELSE.
GUY WITH THE CAP, WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?
 MY NAME IS DAN.
 Jeff: DAN, DOES THIS RING
TRUE FOR YOU, THIS DESCRIPTION
OF BLUE COLLAR?
 HELL, YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU'RE WITH YOUR
BROTHERS?
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
ABSOLUTELY.
WE BUILT THE HEART OF AMERICA,
BLOOD, SWEAT, TEAR, CALLUSES ON
OUR HAND, SORE AT THE END OF THE
DAY BUT A SMILE ON OUR FACE
KNOWING WE ACCOMPLISHED A GOOD
DAY'S WORK.
 Jeff: HOW ABOUT THE WOMAN
IN THE FRONT WITH THE NECKLACE.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 LINDSEY.
 Jeff: LINDSEY, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT?
 THE WINNER OF THIS SHOW IS ON
THIS MAT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THAT BRINGS US TO RED.
YOU GUYS ARE THE NO COLLARS, THE
FREE SPIRITS.
YOUR PROFESSIONS TEND TO BE
CENTERED AROUND PASSION.
 100%.
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU DON'T REALLY MAKE
THE RULES.
YOU'RE REALLY NOT FOLLOWING THE
RULES.
NO COLLARS TEND TO BREAK THE
RULES.
GUY IN THE BACK, WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?
 VINCE.
 Jeff: YOU EMBRACE THAT
ALREADY, DON'T YOU?
 100%.
AS SOON AS I SAW THESE PEOPLE, I
KNEW I WAS WITH MY FAMILY.
 Jeff: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
JUST LOOKING AT A GROUP?
 FIRST SMILES YOU SEE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT FREE SMILE,
IT'S THAT I LIVE THE WAY THAT I
WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE, NOT
GOVERNED BY ANYBODY ELSE'S
RULES.
 Jeff: GUY IN THE FRONT,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 RODNEY.
 Jeff: RODNEY, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THIS OTHER GROUP, DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT?
 I MOVE FURNITURE, SO
BASICALLY THE OFFICE PEOPLE, I
MOVE OFFICE STUFF, I MOVE
JACUZZI, ALL THE STUFF THE LAZY
PEOPLE WHO SIT AT THE DESK DON'T
WANT THE MOVE, SO I'M HARD
WORKER.
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE ME.
I'M JACKED.
I WORK HARD AND PLAY HARDER.
 I USE MY MIND TO OUTWHIT
PEOPLE.
I'M A HUSTLER.
I'M A SALESMAN.
THIS IS WHAT I DO.
EVERY DAVIE TO SELL MYSELF TO
GET MONEY.
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR, YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ACHEING TO GET
INTO THIS CONVERSATION.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 CAROLYN.
 Jeff: YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR
HEAD.
 WE WORK JUST AS HARD AND WE
HAVE JUST AS MUCH FREE SPIRIT AS
ANYONE ELSE HERE.
 Jeff: GUY IN THE BACK,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
JOAQUIN.
 Jeff: JOAQUIN, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF BEING ON THE WHITE
COLLAR TRIBE?
 I WOULDN'T CHOOSE ANY OTHER
SIDE.
MAY 9:00 UNTIL 5:00 DUNN DEFINE
WHO I AM.
 Jeff: GREAT POINT, TO JUDGE
A BOOK SIMPLY BY ITS COVER CAN
BE A VERY COSTLY MISTAKE.
LET'S GET TO IT.
WHITE COLLAR, YOU'RE NOW GOING
TO PICK ONE PERSON TO REPRESENT
YOUR TRIBE.
CHOOSE SOMEBODY.
 ANYONE WANT TO VOLUNTEER?
 JEFF ASKED SOMEONE TO STEP
OUT FRONT AND TAKE ON A WEIGHTY
DECISION.
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED FROM
STUDYING THIS GAME IS THE
BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE IS
PUTTING YOURSELF INTO A
LEADERSHIP POSITION.
 SURE.
 Jeff: JOAQUIN.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: JOAQUIN, TAKE A
COUPLE STEPS FORWARD OFF THAT
MAT.
RIGHT THERE IS GOOD.
PERFECT.
BLUE COLLAR, SAME THING, PICK
ONE PERSON TO REPRESENT YOUR
TRIBE.
 THAT'S COOL.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR, WHO IS
IT GOING TO BE?
 ME.
 Jeff: DAN, ARE YOU
COMFORTABLE BEING SELECTED?
 IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.
THIS COULD GO EITHER WAY.
 Jeff: DAN, TAKE A COUPLE
STEPS FORWARD.
ALL RIGHT, NO COLLAR, WHO ARE
YOU GOING TO PICK TO REPRESENT
YOUR TRIBE?
 I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
 WILL.
 BIG SURPRISE, THEY'RE HAVING
HARD TIME DECIDING ANYTHING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WHITE --
NO COLLARS, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO
SELECT?
DO YOU NEED A WHITE COMER TO GO
OVER THERE?
 WE DON'T GET OFFENDED.
IT ROLLS OFF OUR BACK.
 Jeff: WHO WILL IT BE?
 WILL.
 Jeff: WOMAN IN THE FRONT,
WHY WILL?
 HE PROMISED US SANDWICHES.
THAT'S WHY WE PICKED HIM.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
SANDWICHES.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: USING WHAT?
 I HAVE A WHOLE RESOURCE OUT
THERE.
 Jeff: FROM THE OCEAN YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE SANDWICHES?
 IT'S GOING TO BE NICE.
 Jeff: YOU'RE STILL NOT
BACKING DOWN.
 THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WILL, TAKE A STEP FORWARD.
 I HAD A VIDEO THAT WENT VIRAL
OF ME AND MY WIFE DANCING AND
SINGING AT THE GAS STATION.
PEOPLE LIKED THE VIDEO BECAUSE
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TAKE LIFE TOO
SERIALLY AND DON'T TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE
THAT.
JUST LIVE IN THE MOMENT.
JUST PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN AND
JUST HAVE FUN.
 Jeff: WILL?
 YEP.
 Jeff: DAN, JOAQUIN, YOU'RE
GOING TO PICK A SECOND MEMBER,
AND THIS PERSON IS GOING TO JOIN
YOU IN MAKING A VERY BIG
DECISION ON BEHALF OF YOUR
TRIBE.
WHO DO YOU WANT TO JOIN YOU?
CHOOSE SOMEBODY.
 ANYBODY VOLUNTEER?
NO?
YES.
YOU'RE IN.
 OKAY.
 IT'S ALL YOU, BOSS.
 Jeff: WOMAN ON THE END,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 I'M SO.
 Jeff: SO, BEING A LEADER
CAN BE A VERY PRECARIOUS
POSITION THAT YOU PUT YOURSELF
IN.
 BUT I'M STANDING WITH SOMEONE
ELSE, SO IF I'M FALLING, HE'S
FALLING WITH ME I GUESS.
 Jeff: DAN, WHY MIKE?
 HE VOLUNTEERED.
 Jeff: NO COLLARS, WILL, YOU
TURNED AND PRETTY QUICKLY CHOSE
JENN.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
JENN?
 JENN IS A FREE SPIRIT LIKE
EVERYONE ON THIS MAP.
I KNOW I CAN TRUST HER AND SHE'S
GOING THE MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISIONS FOR OUR TEAM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WHITE COLLAR, YOUR TRIBE NAME IS
MASAYA.
HERE'S MAP TO YOUR HOME.
BLUE COLLAR, YOUR TRIBE NAME,
ESCAMECA.
NO COLLARS, YOUR TRIBE NAME,
NAGAROTE.
HEAD BACK THE CAMP.
WHEN YOU GET SETTLED, EACH PAIR
WILL SEPARATE AND MAKE A
DECISION FOR THEIR TRIBE.
GOOD LUCK.
HEAD OUT.
 YEAH, BABY.
 JEFF SAID EVERYONE GO BACK
THE CAMP.
I COULD SEE THE OTHER TWO TRIBES
GOING, THOSE WHITE COLLAR PEOPLE
WHO WORK IN THE OFFICES, WE WANT
TO KILL THEM.
BUT TO ME, CLASS HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH IT.
IT'S "SURVIVOR" WARFARE.
 I LOVE BEING A NO CALLER.
I CAN JUST SEE IT IN PEOPLE'S
EYES THAT THEY'RE FUN KIND OF
PEOPLE.
I THINK AS A TRIBE, THE GAME
PLAN RIGHT NOW IS TO BE REALLY
LAID BACK AND LET IT FLOW.
I KIND OF LIVE LIFE THAT WAY.
 YOU PROBABLY ARE WONDERING
ABOUT MY EARS.
I'M COMPLETELY DEAF.
I LOST MY HEARING SEVEN YEARS
AGO, SO I HAVE COCHLEAR
IMPLANTS.
THAT'S HOW I HEAR.
THEY WERE ALL EXTREMELY SHOCKED
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I'M
COMPLETELY DEAF.
I KNOW THAT I'LL BE AT A
DISADVANTAGE, BUT THE MOST I CAN
DO IS GO INTO IT 110. AND GIVE
IT ALL I'VE GOT.
 YOU GUYS WANT TO WALK AROUND,
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO
SET UP CAMP?
 WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A
DECISION BASED ON WHAT IT MIGHT
BE.
 WE HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
BEFORE THE TRIBE.
SO WE SAID, OKAY, WE HAVE THE
MAKE DECISIONINGS AS A GROUP.
 NUMBER ONE, WE'RE WORKING AS
A TEAM.
THAT'S HOW YOU WIN.
 WE HAVE THE VIBE.
 IT MUST BE SOMETHING.
 HONEST, DECEIVE.
 ALL RIGHT.
YOU WANT ME TO READ DECEIVE?
DECEIVE: IF YOU CHOOSE TO
DECEIVE, YOU'LL RECEIVE A SMALL
BAG OF BEANS TO TAKE BACK TO
YOUR TRIBE.
IT WILL ONLY LAST A FEW DAYS.
YOU WILL BE GIVEN A CLUE TO THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 HONESTY: IF YOU CHOOSE TO BE
HONEST, YOU WILL RECEIVE A HUGE
BAG OF BEANS AND IT WILL SHOW
YOU CAN BE TRUSTED.
IF WE WANTED TO BE DISHONEST, WE
COULD HAVE A CLUE FOR THE
IMMUNITY IDOL AND TAKE A SMALL
BAG OF BEANS.
OR WE COULD BE HONEST WITH THE
TRIBE AND TAKE A HUMONGOUS BAG
OF BEANS.
 I THINK WE SHOULD BRING THE
BIG BAG AND LET THEM KNOW.
ULTIMATELY WE'RE MAKING A
DECISION FOR OUR TRIBE, SO
OBVIOUSLY THE CHOICE IS THE BIG
BEAN BAG.
WE'RE NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL
GAME.
WE'RE DOING THE BEST FOR US AS A
CREW.
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.
 SO YOU WANT TO BE GOOD GUYS,
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE BAD GUYS?
HOW DO YOU WANT TO START?
 MY HEART SAYS I WANT TO BE A
GOOD GUY, BUT VILLAINS WIN THIS
GAME.
 BUT I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO
BE A VILLAIN.
 I AGREE.
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE
BEANS.
 I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE
BEAN, AS WELL.
 YOU SURE?
 NO.
 TAKE THE BEANS.
 TAKE THE BEENGS, DUDE.
WE HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING
THIS EARLY.
 I AGREE.
TAKE THE BEANS.
 MY INCLINATION IS TO GO WITH
THE HONESTY SIMPLY BECAUSE AT
THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, TO THROW
DECEIT, I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S
STUPID.
 PEOPLE, WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DOING?
 YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON TRYING
TO BUILD THAT CAMARADERIE.
 BASICALLY WE GET OVER THERE,
AND THERE'S AN HONEST AND A
DECEIT TAB IN FRONT OF US.
THE HONEST TAB SAID, IF YOU ARE
HONEST AND YOU DON'T TAKE THE
ADVANTAGE, THEN YOU GET A BIG
BAG OF BEANS.
WE TOOK THE BIG BAG OF BEANS.
 MICE!
 IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE GAME.
 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S A FULL
BAG OF BEANS.
I THINK THEY CHOSE THE OTHER
ONE.
THAT'S NOT A BIG BAG.
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE, FOUR
BEANS?
 TRUST TAKES TIME.
HOPEFULLY WE JUST EARNED A
LITTLE.
 IF YOU'VE GIVEN US A REASON
TO THINK YOU'RE LYING AND NOT
BEING HONEST, YOU KNOW, THEN YOU
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT.
 THEY SCREWED US.
 EITHER THEY BELIEVE US OR
THEY DON'T.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE HAVE TO GO
WITH IT.
I MEAN, YEAH.
 THE HARD PART IS NOT
JUGGLING.
THE HARD PART IS NOT LOOKING AT
YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU'RE JUGGLING.
 WHAT IF I DO THIS?
[LAUGHTER]
 MY NAME'S JOAQUIN.
I'M FROM NEW YORK.
I'M A MARKETING DIRECTOR.
 I'M IN TRAINING.
SO FIRST THING YOU DO IN
TRAINING IS INTRODUCTIONS.
 I'M TYLER, AND I JUST UNTIL
RECENTLY WAS WORKING AT THE
LARGEST HOLLYWOOD TALENT AGENCY.
 YOU NAME, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED HERE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE DID.
WE'RE IN THE ASHAMED OF BEING
WHITE COLLAR.
 MY NAME IS MAX.
I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
RIGHT NOW I AM A RESEARCHER AND
CONSULTANT.
 THEY ALL KNEW WHAT TO DO.
IT WAS LIKE CLOCKWORK.
 JEFF SAID THAT WHEN WE GOT
BACK TO CAMP, JOAQUIN AND I
WOULD HAVE TO WALK OFF AND MAKE
SOME SORT OF DECISION.
 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR STORY
STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU GO BACK THE
CAMP.
 HONESTLY, I KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING, WE'RE TAKING THAT
QUESTION.
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO TELL THEM?
 THAT MEANS WE'RE IN AN
ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK WE WERE IN AN
ALLIANCE WHEN YOU STEPPED
FORWARD.
 THE OTHER POSSIBLE DECISION
IS GO WITH THE HONEST ROUTE.
 THAT'S A SILLY DECISION.
SHE'S A CUTIE.
SHE'S REALLY COOL AND DOWN TO
EARTH, BUT I'M LIKE, COME ON,
WHO THE HELL IS HONEST.
ARE YOU HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS OR
ARE YOU HERE TO WIN $1 MILLION.
LET'S GO, CUTIE.
IF I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE, I'M
GOING THE TAKE IT.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT THAT, AS WELL.
 JOAQUIN WAS SO SURE.
THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM THAT
WANTED TO BE HONEST OR LIKE WORK
WITH THE TRIBE.
 YOU HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR GUT.
WHAT IS YOUR GUT TELLING YOU?
 OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
ULTIMATELY THAT GUT INSTINCT TO
HAVE THAT ADVANTAGE WON, NOT TOO
FAR FROM WHERE YOU CLENCH YOUR
FIRST, YOU CAN SATIATE YOUR NEED
FOR POWER.
NESTLED IN A NEST WITH NO NEED
TO CLIMB, THIS JUST MAY BE YOUR
FINEST HOUR.
OKAY.
SO WHERE YOU QUENCH YOUR THIRST.
 SO THAT'S WHERE THE WELL IS,
WHEREVER THE WELL IS.
 NESTLED IN A NOOK.
 I LOVE HAVING AN ADVANTAGE.
BUT THAT MEANS I HAVE TO TRUST
JOAQUIN.
THAT'S SCARY, TOO.
 YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME NOW.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL.
 THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S PERFECTLY OKAY.
 THE DECISION WE ULTIMATELY
MADE WAS TO DECEIVE.
WE TOOK THE CLUE.
 DID YOU HIDE IT?
 YES.
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS PUTTING
TARGET ON MY BACK.
MY WHOLE GAME COULD COME
CRASHING DOWN AROUND ME.
 WHEN SO AND JOAQUIN COME BACK
THE CAMP, THEY HAVE THIS BAG
THAT'S TIED SHUT.
 WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT?
 YOU WERE GONE FOR A WHILE.
 WE HAD A DILEMMA.
 WHAT WAS IT?
 THERE WERE THREE BOXES.
THERE WAS ONE THAT SAID HONEST,
ONE THAT SAID DECEIVE AND ONE
THAT SAID NEUTRAL.
AND WE PICKED NEUTRAL BECAUSE
WHATEVER... IF WE PICKED HONEST
OR DECEIVE, THEY SAID THERE WAS
GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF LIKE
CAVEAT WITH IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.
 IS IT RICE?
 IT'S BEANS.
 WE WANTED TO PICK HONEST...
 WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
 LISTEN, BETTER TO BE NEUTRAL.
DAY ONE, RIGHT IN
 I DON'T REALLY TRUST SO, AND
JOAQUIN.
I'M THINKING THEY HAVE SECLUDEED
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
I WOULD DO THE SAME THING.
I CAN'T BE PISSED OFF AT ANYBODY
ELSE.
THIS IS A GAME.
HELLO.
 I THINK THAT BAG OF BEANS IS
REALLY SMALL.
 THEY'RE TERRIBLE LIARS.
I DON'T BUY THAT FOR A SECOND.
 AS A "SURVIVOR" FAN, I KNEW
IT'S HONESTY OR DECEPTION, AND
THEY CLEARLY CHOSE DECEPTION.
SO I WANT TO IMMEDIATELY START
CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE.
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK
ABOUT ME.
I WANT TO SEE IF ANYBODY THERE
IS WILLING TO ENGAGE.
 EXACTLY.
 I THINK WE CAN BE STRONG.
 CAROLYN'S LIKE, I'M JUST SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE.
SO AM I, GIRLFRIEND.
DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
 ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOOD.
YES.
 OH, MY GOSH.
SHE WAS DOWN.
ALSO I GET A REALLY GOOD VIBE
FROM MAX BASED ON APPEARANCES,
YOU NOW, LIKE A HIPSTER ACADEMIC
TYPE.
 SO AND JOAQUIN ARE WAY TOO
CLOSE.
THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WHERE THE
IDOL IS AT.
SO CAROLYN AND I WERE TALKING
THIS MORNING AND SAYING...
 SO AND JOAQUIN ARE GETTING
DANGEROUS?
 YEAH.
 YEAH, I AGREE.
 FROM THAT POINT I HAD A GREAT
BOND WITH CAROLYN.
I HAD A GREAT BOND WITH MAX.
THAT'S THREE OF US IN A TRIBE OF
SIX.
 AS LONG AS WE KNOW US THREE
ARE TIGHT, WE CAN WORK IT FROM
THERE.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 CRAB DINNER.
 GOT HIM, GOT HIM.
MAMA'S EATING DINNER TONIGHT.
 WE'RE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS.
WE SAW WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.
WE ALL JUMPED INTO IT BECAUSE
WE'LL FIND A WAY.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
 YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT.
 AND THERE IS FIRE.
OH, BOO
-YEAH, BABY.
WE GOT A FIRE BUILT IN THE FIRST
TWO HOURS.
IN ONE SENTENCE: BLUE COLLARS
KICK ASS.
 THANK YOU.
 I HAVE THIS.
THIS WHOLE ARM IS JUST FAMILY
STUFF.
AND I HAVE LIKE AN OCEAN PIECE
ON MY LEG.
 WHEN I SAW MY TRIBE, I WAS
REALLY HAPPY.
I YOU GET A GIRL ALL TATTED UP.
SHE HAS ARTWORK ON HER BODY.
SHE WANTS TO EXPRESS HERSELF IN
SOME WAY.
IT'S EASY ENTRY THE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING.
 WHAT'S THAT THERE?
 NATALIE, EVEN THOUGH WE'LL
NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN,
WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.
 YOU LOST YOUR SISTER?
 A FEW YEARS AGO.
SHE LIVES DOWNSTAIRS IN THE
APARTMENT.
I KNOCK ON THE DOOR ON MONDAY.
HER CAR AIN'T.
THERE I'M LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED?
I TRIED GETTING THE DOOR, IT'S
DEADBOLTED.
I BUSTED THROUGH A WINDOW.
I SEE HER FACE FIRST ON THE
GROUND, BLOOD SURROUNDING THE
AREA.
I FOUND MY SISTER IN COLD BLOOD
TWO YEARS AGO.
COMING INTO "SURVIVOR," I KNEW I
COULD GET TO ANY GIRL'S HEART
WITH THAT STORY, SO IT MAKES ME
SOLIDIFY WHEN I HAVE THIS TATTOO
ON MY ARM, THEY CAN TELL I'M
TELLING THE TRUTH AND BEING
REAL.
MY STRATEGY FROM DAY ONE, GET
THE GIRLS.
GIRL, THEY WANT TO SIT BACK AND
LET MAN TAKE THE LEADER ROLE.
SO I WANT TO GET THE GIRLS.
I WANT TO BE THEIR LEADER AND
TAKE THEM TO THE MERGE WITH ME.
 SCORPION.
 WHERE?
 RIGHT HERE.
SO I GRAB THIS PIECE OF BAMBOO
I'M ABOUT TO CUT.
I HAPPEN THE SEE THIS SCORPION
GO BY.
IT'S IN THE THAT BIG OF A
SCORPION AT ALL THAT BIG ENOUGH
THAT I'M SURE IF IT STUNG YOU IT
WOULD DO SOME DAMAGE.
 WANT TO EAT HIM?
 FIRST INSTINCT IS PROTEIN.
SO I CUT ITS TAIL OFF.
 ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
 YOU GOING TO EAT THAT THING?
 I NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE.
 HOW DOES IT TASTE?
 DOWN THE HATCH.
IT TASTED LIKE CRAP.
 DID YOU EAT A SCORPION?
 IN THE TASTY.
[LAUGHTER]
 WHEN YOU GUYS ARE STARVING
LATER TONIGHT AND I HAVE A
SCORPION IN MY BELLY, DON'T BE
MAD.
I KNEW WHEN I CAME OUT HERE IF
THERE WAS AN EXTRA CHANCE TO GET
PROTEIN, I WAS GOING TO TAKE
THAT CHANCE.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT MIGHT
NOT HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST
DECISION I EVER MADE.
 DID YOU EAT IT RAW?
 IS HE PUKING?
 HE'S PUKING?
 HE ATE A SCORPION.
 MAYBE NOT THE BEST DECISION
TO EAT A SCORPION ON THE FIRST
DAY OF "SURVIVOR," BUT I'M THE
TYPE OF PERSON, IF I SEE AN
OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF ME, I'M
GOING TO GO GRAB IT.
I'M GOING TO RUN AS FAST AS I
CAN AND CLENCH ON AS HARD AS I
CAN AND RIDE THAT BULL FOR AS
LONG AS I CAN.
I SAW THE SCORPION.
I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY.
AND I PAID THE CONSEQUENCE.
THAT'S YOUR BOY.
THAT'S WEAKNESS LEAVING THE
BODY.
 THIS IS OUR FIRST COCONUT,
GUYS.
 YES!
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE BONGO
DRUMS.
 SO SWEET.
 NO COLOR -- COMEER IS A
WONDERFUL LITTLE COMMUNITY.
EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT.
WE'RE MESHING AND FLOWING
SMOOTHER THAN HOT BUTTER.
 I'M SO HAPPY.
 THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT JENN
THAT JUST SEEMS REAL.
THAT MAKES ME COMFORTABLE,
COMPLETELY, EMOTIONALLY SECURE,
PHYSICALLY SECURE, AND IT'S
WONDERFUL.
 I USED TO HAVE FEATHERS IN MY
HAIR, NOT THAT THAT'S AN
IMMEDIATE CONNECTION.
BUT I WAS LIKE, MY PEOPLE.
 I SAW YOUR SMILE, YOUR BIG
BRIGHT EYES.
INSTANT CONNECTION.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU AND I WITH OUR
INTELLIGENCE, WE REALLY COULD
MAKE IT ALL THE WAY.
 THE GUY WITH THE FEATHERS,
RIGHT OFF THE BAT HE PULLS ME
ASIDE AND TELLS ME HE THINKS WE
HAVE A KIN MADRID SPIRIT, I LIKE
YOU SMILE, I WANT TO GO TO THE
END WITH YOU.
HE'S EVERYTHING I EXPECTED HIM
TO BE.
AND MORE MAYBE.
 IF YOU CREATE FRIENDSHIPS THE
WAY I DO.
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BREAK A
BOND.
 IT'S NICE TO HAVE ONE PERSON
YOU KNOW.
 THE ANCHOR.
 ONE OF MY GREATEST WEAKNESSES
IS MY INTENSE ATTRACTION TO
WOMEN.
JENN BROUGHT AN ELEMENT OF
HERSELF HERE AND SO DID I.
I WANT TO PLAY WITH SOMEBODY
THAT'S LIKE THAT.
WHEN I WANT SOMETHING, I GET IT.
 HE'S PLAYING THIS GAME A
LITTLE HARDER THAN I WOULD HAVE
SEEN COMING OUT OF THOSE
FEATHERS.
I'M THINKING, IT IS WORTH IT TO
PLAY WHATEVER HE THINKS I AM TO
HIM, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S WORTH IT
TO HAVE ALLY TO, HAVE PEOPLE ON
YOUR SIDE, SO THAT'S MY APPROACH
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.
 LET'S RAISE THIS UP HERE.
AT LEAST THAT'S OFF THE GROUND.
 WE CAN DO THAT.
 VINCE SAID HE WANTED TO DO
THE SHELTER A CERTAIN WAY.
AND I SAID, HEY, MAN, WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO.
YOU KNOW, VERY NO COLLAR OF ME,
BUT IN THIS SITUATION, I HAVE A
LOT OF SKILLS THAT I BRING TO
THE TABLE.
I'VE WORKED IN CONSTRUCTION.
I'VE BUILT A LOT OF THINGS.
 WE HAVE THESE REALLY LONG
BAMBOOS THAT WE CAN USE FOR THE
A-FRAME.
 THIS IS JUST THE TOP OF OUR
LEAN-TO.
 HOW ABOUT WE GET THIS UP AND
GO WITH THE FRAME.
 I THINK THAT'S A LOT MORE
WORK.
I'M THINKING STICK THIS UP
THERE, PUT THREE OR FOUR FRAMES
HERE AND PUT IT ON.
 I JUST WANT TO GET A ROOF ON.
I'M IN THE A BIG FAN OF
SOMETHING TELLING ME TO DO
SOMETHING I KNOW IS WRONG.
I KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET
IT SECURED.
SO AT SOME POINT POLITENESS GOES
AWAY.
 YOU WANT TO BRING THIS ONE IN
SO WE HAVE LESS SPACE TO FILL?
 LET'S JUST PUT IT TOGETHER
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE'RE SPONTANEOUS, REMEMBER?
WE'RE THE SPONTANEOUS TRIBE.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
 WATCHING JOE WANT TO DO IT
HIS WAY AND ONLY HIS WAY, IT WAS
A HUGE RED FLAG.
WE'RE IN NO-COLLAR TRIBE.
WE NEED TO HAVE COLLABORATION,
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT, IT'S
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.
 THAT'S KIND OF HIGH.
 WHAT'S THE ONE THING WE'RE
MISSING?
WE'RE MISSING SOMEBODY TO MAKE
THE DECISION.
LET'S MAKE SOME DECISIONS.
 MAKE A DECISION.
 I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GOING
THE NEED THREE POSTS IS WHAT WE
SAID, YES?
 THAT'S STUPID.
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING YOU CAN
DO.
 WHY ARE YOU UPSET?
WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED IN
 BECAUSE THE SUPPORT IS GOING
TO BE...
 I'M STARTING TO GET
FRUSTRATED.
 DAN DEFINITELY GETS UNDER MY
SKIN BECAUSE HE SAYS THINGS THAT
ARE JUST OVER THE TOP AND
DRAMATIC.
HE'S ONE PERSON THAT DOESN'T
BELONG.
 BAMBOO IS HALLOW.
IT WON'T STAY.
IT WILL SPLIT THE BAMBOO AND
DROP US.
I AM A FAT GUY.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HOLD.
 DAN WITH HIS AGE AND BEING
MALE, HE WANTS THE PROVE HIMSELF
THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT, BUT HE'S DEALING WITH 20
YEAR OLDS, AND HE'S TWICE THEIR
AGE, SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
LISTEN TO THEM, BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE THOSE SOCIAL SKILLS TO WORK
IT OUT.
 I THINK THAT'S WAY TOO HIGH.
 DAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 MAKE A DECISION.
 NO, NO, NO.
 I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT WANTS
THIS.
 NOW YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR
MIND.
FIRST YOU SAID LOWER IT.
DON'T BE WISHY-WASHY.
 I AGREE WITH HER.
I THINK IT SHOULD BE LOWER.
 WELL, SAY THAT.
 EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING, I
GET YELLED AT.
NOW I DON'T SAY SOMETHING AND
I'M STILL GETTING A HARD TIME.
 WE DISCUSSED IT EARLIER.
 I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.
 THE WHOLE THING STARTED WITH
LINDSEY.
I SAW CIERA'S REACTION.
I SAW KELLY.
NOW I TRY TO CHANGE TACTICS.
I HAVE TO LAY BACK AND SHUT MY
MOUTH.
 DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY OR GO
GET FIREWOOD?
 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO?
 I JUST WANT TO BE OF USE
SOMEWHERE.
I'LL GO GET SOME FIREWOOD.
 I'M IN A NO-WIN SITUATION.
I'M REALLY IN A BAD POSITION
FAST WITH THIS TRIBE.
 THE GUY WITH THE BEARD, HE'S
KIND OF BOSSY.
WE NEED TO GET OUR HARRY POTTER
GRANDFATHER OUT OF HERE.
 I AM IN THE FARING WELL IN
THIS GAME.
I TRY TO STAY OUT OF MAKING A
DECISION, I TRY TO MAKE A
DECISION, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 IT'S TOUGH.
 I AGREE.
 YOU ARE TAKING A LITTLE HEAT.
I NOTICED THAT TODAY.
YOU ARE TAKING SOME HEAT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE
YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIEND IN THE
WORLD BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GOT A
FRIEND WITH ME.
 I HEAR THAT.
I HEAR THAT.
MIKE'S GREAT.
HE REALLY WANTS TO STAY
POSITIVE.
THAT MAN IS A WALKING RAY OF
SUNSHINE.
HE'S ABSOLUTELY THE GLUE HOLDING
US TOGETHER NOW.
 THERE'S PROBABLY A MILLION
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE HERE,
BUT WE'RE HERE.
 STILL THE BEST DAY EVER.
 HOW COME YOU KNOW HOW THE
START A FIRE WITHOUT FLINT?
 I SAW THIS ON YOUTUBE AND I
DID IT EVERY DAY BEFORE I CAME
OUT HERE.
 JOE SAYS, I CAN MAKE FIRE,
SO, JOE, GO MAKE FIRE.
YOU SAY YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT
FLINT, I'M GOING TO SIT HERE AND
TRY THE WATCH YOU DO THAT.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT
THIS.
 I DO.
THAT LOOKS AMAZING.
MY PRINCESS.
 STOP IT.
 I LIKE JOE A LOT.
I THINK HIS PERSONALITY IS
GREAT.
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING DUDE.
HE'S TALL, HE'S MUSCULAR.
HE SHOULD BE ON THE COVER OF A
ROMANCE MODEL.
 DO YOU NEED HELP BLOWING ON
THE FIREWOOD?
 NO.
 DO YOU NEED HELP BLOWING ON
THAT WOOD OVER THERE?
 GOT TO MAKE THIS HOLE A
LITTLE BIGGER.
 THIS GAME MEANS THE WORLD TO
ME.
I HAVE BEEN SUCH A HUGE FAN MY
WHOLE LIFE.
I SAID I CAN MAKE FIRE, SO I GOT
TO BACK IT UP AND MAKE FIRE.
 I SEE IT SMOKING.
 YOU GOT IT.
 ONE GOOD ONE.
GOOD.
KEEP GOING.
 YEAH.
 GO, GO!
 YES!
 FOR ME GETTING THE FIRE WAS
THE BEST FEELING IN THE WHOLE
WORLD.
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
IT SCORED ME SOME POINTS WITH
THE TRIBE.
 I'M GOING TO GET SOME WATER.
 I ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH JENN, BUT IT SEEMS
LIKE SHE WANTS TO RIDE THE WAVE
THAT JOE'S MAKING.
THAT WORRIES ME BECAUSE I DON'T
TRUST HIM.
SO I HAVE TO FURTHER EXPLORE
THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JENN.
I HAVE TO REALLY FEEL OUT WHO
SHE IS AS AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU A REAL
HUMAN-TO-HUMAN QUESTION.
 OKAY.
 DO YOU FEEL MORE OF A
CONNECTION WITH JOE?
 NO.
NONE.
I'M NOT PLAYING THIS FLIRT GAME.
 YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM?
 NO.
 NOT EVEN A LITTLE?
 NO.
 I THINK VINCE IS JEALOUS.
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS OUT OF
HIS MOUTH IS, SO DO YOU THINK
JOE IS ATTRACTIVE?
WHAT?
 BUT YOU LIKE HIM?
 I LIKE HIM AS A HUMAN BEING.
I LIKE YOU AS A HUMAN BEING,
TOO.
IT'S NOT LIKE I PREFER HIM OVER
YOU AT ALL.
HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT THESE LITTLE
PUPPY DOG FEELINGS THAT
APPARENTLY HE HAD FOR ME HURT.
BUT I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM.
I THINK.
 IT'S STILL ME AND YOU?
 YOU STILL WANT THAT?
 I DO.
DO YOU?
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT?
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
WANTING THAT?
 I DO.
I REALLY WANT THAT.
 I DO.
 BUT I'M NOT SEEING ENOUGH
EVIDENCE?
I WOULD REALLY LIKE IF JENN WERE
AN HONEST PERSON, BUT I JUST
DON'T FEEL THAT.
I JUST FEEL LIKE SHE'S BEING
FAKE.
 ARE YOU LESS STRESSED NOW.
 IF YOU GIVE ME A GOOD HUG.
 VINCE IS THE MOST PARANOID
PERSON OUT HERE.
DEALING WITH HIM IS A LOT.
CALM DOWN, YOU KNOW?
HE'S DRIVING ME NUTS.
 THAT'S A GOOD HUG.
 OH, I NEEDED THAT.
 AND DON'T HUG ME FOREVER
AFTER.
WE SMELL BAD.
OKAY.
WE SMELL BAD.
DO NOT GET THIS ALL OVER MY
FACE.
 THERE'S OUR LOVELY ABODE.
 IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A TRAIN
WRECK.
 IT'S NOT SO BAD.
WE HAVE A ROOF.
WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON IT TODAY.
 OKAY.
 MY THOUGHTS ARE, THE SHELTER
IS VERY AVERAGE.
IT WAS PROBABLY THE WORST NIGHT
OF SLEEP I'VE EVER HAD IN MY
LIFE.
 WHAT KIND OF SHELTER DO WE
WANT TO BUILD?
 I'LL TAKE A NICE LITTLE
MATTRESS.
 OUR TRIBE IS WHITE COLLAR
PEOPLE WHO RUN THE SHOW.
BUT THE REALITY IS WE'VE GOT TO
GRAB OUR LUNCHBOXES AND GRIND
THINGS OUT WITH THE BLUE
COLLAR-LIKE WORK ETHIC.
 LET'S WORK ON AN ACTION PLAN.
 I'LL SLITHER DOWN HERE.
THIS COULD USE A LITTLE BIT MORE
COVERAGE HERE.
ANYTHING?
 THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG?
COME ON.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE THAT DAMN HARD TO MAKE A
FIRE.
NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A DAMN
FIRE.
NONE OF US DO.
WHY WOULD WE?
WHITE COLLAR.
WE HIRE A BLUE COLLAR TO GO MAKE
US A FIRE.
WE'RE NOT GETTING FIRE, BUT IT'S
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW?
I'M GOING THE START GOING TO
LOOK FOR THAT IMMUNITY IDOL.
 WHEN SO AND JOAQUIN CAME BACK
TO CAMP WITH THAT BAG OF BEANS,
I KIND OF FIGURED THEY HAD A
CLUE.
SO I WATCHED THEM LIKE A HAWK
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE LOOKING
THERE, THEN MAYBE IT'S OVER
THERE.
SO MADE IT SO FREAKIN' OBVIOUS.
SHE'S SEARCHING IN THAT TREE
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.
I KIND OF KNOW FROM WATCHING
SEASONS PAST THE TYPES OF THINGS
YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR.
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S
DIFFERENT.
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT.
I SAW THIS FUNNY-LOOKING TREE,
AND I'M LIKE, OKAY.
YEAH!
I GOT THE IDOL.
OH, MY GOD!
I OPEN IT UP, AND I'M LIKE, YOU
HAVE FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
THE MAGICAL PART OF THIS IS
EVERYONE THINKS THAT SO AND
JOAQUIN HAVE THE CLUE AND
THEY'RE ALL STILL LOOKING.
IT'S HILARIOUS.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO
YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 BRING IT ON.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING THE RACE
DOWN A RAMP, GO THROUGH AN
OBSTACLE WHERE YOU WILL MAKE
YOUR WAY TO A LARGE WOODEN CRATE
CONTAINING A LADDER.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU CAN OPEN IT USING A KEY TO
UNLOCKLEAR, OR YOU CAN UNTIE
KNOTS.
BOTH WILL RELEASE THE LADDER.
ONCE YOU HAVE THE LADDER FREE,
YOU WILL USE IT TO GO UP, ACROSS
AND DOWN A TALL PLATFORM AND
THROUGH ANOTHER SERIES OF
OBSTACLES.
YOU WILL THEN USE THE LADDER TO
HELP YOU MAKE YOUR BIGGEST
DECISION IN THIS CHALLENGE,
WHICH PUZZLE TO SOLVE.
THERE ARE THREE CHOICES.
THE FIRST PUZZLE HAS ONLY FIVE
PIECES IN IT, BUT IT REQUIRES
YOU TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE.
IF YOU CAN DO THAT, YOU CAN
SOLVE THIS FIVE-PIECE PUZZLE
VERY QUICKLY.
THE SECOND PUZZLE HAS TEN PIECES
IN IT, AND IT REQUIRES YOU TO
SEE THINGS MORE VISUALLY.
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU THINK, YOU
WILL WHIP THROUGH THIS PUZZLE.
THE THIRD PUZZLE HAS THE MOST
PIECES AT 50, BUT IT IS ALSO THE
MOST STRAIGHT FORWARD.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT
PUZZLE IS 50 PIECES.
ALL OF THESE PUZZLES AVERAGE THE
SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO FINISH.
IF YOU PUT THE RIGHT PERSON ON
THE RIGHT PUZZLE, YOU CAN FINISH
MUCH FASTER THAN AVERAGE.
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH
THEIR PUZZLE WINS IMMUNITY.
THIS IS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
IF YOU HAVE THE IDOL, YOU ARE
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
YOU CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.
FIRST TRIBE TO FINISH WINS THIS.
SECOND TRIBE TO FINISH WINS
THIS.
THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING.
LOSERS GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
WORLDS APART."
IN ADDITION YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST TRIBE TO
FINISH, THIS WILL REALLY COME IN
HANDY, A MASSIVE FIRE-MAKING
KIT.
SECOND TRIBE TO FINISH, NOT AS
MUCH, BUT STILL EFFECTIVE,
FLINT, BRAGGING RIGHTS TO BOOT.
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
IT IS THE FIRST CHALLENGE OF
"SURVIVOR: WORLDS APART."
FOR REWARD AND IMMUNITY,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
EVERYBODY ATTACKING THE HAY.
GOT TO HIGH-STEP THIS SECOND
OBSTACLE.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH, GOT IT.
 LINDSEY TAKES A FALL.
NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS.
 COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: ONE PERSON NOW
WORKING ON THIS LADDER.
 GO.
 Jeff: ALL THREE TRIBES HAVE
CHOSEN TO USE THE KEY TO
UNLOCK LOCKS.
NOBODY TOOK THE KNOT.
LINDSEY FOR THE BLUE COLLAR AND
JOAQUIN FOR THE WHITE COLLAR.
20 KEYS THREE OF THEM WORK FOR
THREE DIFFERENT LOCKS.
ANY TIME YOU WANT, YOU CAN
SWITCH OUT.
 IT'S NO, SIR, IT'S NOT.
 Jeff: JOAQUIN WILL JUMP OUT
AND TURN IT OVER TO SO, AND SO
WILL START ON THE KNOT.
LINDSEY IS DROPPING OUT AND
SHE'S SENDING IN MIKE TO DO THE
KNOT.
VINCE IS GIVING UP ON THE KEY.
HE'S PUTTING JOE ON THE KNOT.
 LET'S GO, BABY.
HUGE CHANGE OF EVENTS STRAIGHT
OUT OF THE GATE.
ALL THREE TRIBES NOT NOT AFRAID
TO CHANGE IT UP.
SO WORKING ON THE KNOTS FOR THE
WHITE COLLAR AND SHE'S WHIPPING
THROUGH THEM.
MIKE IS WORKING ON HIS FIFTH
KNOT.
JOE WORKING ON HIS SIXTH
NOVEMBER.
JOE HAS MADE UP A LOT OF TIME
FOR THE NO COLLARS.
SO CONTINUES TO LEAD.
MIKE TRYING TO CATCH HER.
JOE IN SECOND PLACE FOR THE NO
COLLARS.
 YOU GOT IT, MIKE.
DON'T PANIC.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR QUICKLY
FALLING BEHIND IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
SO HAS THE LAST KNOT.
 OPEN IT UP!
 Jeff: RELEASE THAT LADDER
AND HEAD OUT.
WHITE COLLAR IN THE LEAD.
 LET'S GO!
 Jeff: JOE ON HIS LAST
NOVEMBER.
THERE IT IS.
OPEN IT UP, NO COLLARS.
GET THAT LADDER AND START
MOVING.
IT IS WHITE COLLAR, NO COLLAR
AND BLUE COLLAR.
MIKE WITH FIVE KNOTS LEFT.
YOU'RE STILL IN THIS.
KEEP DIGGING.
THERE ARE THREE STAGES, UP,
ACROSS AND DOWN.
WHITE COLLAR NOW WORKING THEIR
WAY ACROSS.
NO COLLAR IS UP THE LADDER.
BLUE COLLAR STILL WORKING ON THE
KNOTS.
 YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MIKE.
 DON'T PANIC.
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR NOW
DOWN.
NO COLLAR TAKING A LOT OF FALLS.
WHITE COLLAR NOW WORKING
TOGETHER MANEUVERING THE NEXT
OBSTACLE.
YOU'VE GOT TO SLIDE THAT LADDER
THROUGH THE SLOTS.
MIKE IS ON HIS LAST KNOT FOR
BLUE COLLAR.
BLUE COLLAR HAS THEIR LADDER.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.
WHITE COLLAR THROUGH THE FIRST
PHASE.
 WE CAN MAKE IT UP.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR IS UP.
NOW THEY HAVE TO GET ACROSS AND
DOWN.
IT'S NOW NO COLLAR IN THE LEAD.
WHITE COLLAR IN SECOND.
BLUE TRYING TO GET BACK IN IT.
NO COLLAR THROUGH THE SECOND
OBSTACLE.
NOW THE BIG DECISION, WHICH
PUZZLE WILL THEY CHOOSE.
WHITE COLLAR'S THROUGH.
THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE ON WHICH
PUZZLE.
LET'S GO, BLUE COLLAR.
 COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: FIVE, TEN OR 50
PIECES MAKE A DECISION.
 TEN.
 Jeff: NO COLLAR IS GOING
FOR THE MIDDLE PUZZLE, THE
VISUAL PUZZLE.
 WHICH ONE?
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR IS GOING
FOR THE EASIEST WITH THE MOST
PIECES.
BIG SURPRISE FROM THE BIG BRAINS
OF THE WHITE COLLAR.
AND AS PREDICTED FOR THE NO
COLLARS, THEY PICKED THE VISUAL
PUZZLE.
 NO PRESSURE.
 SHIRIN IS TAKING THE VERY
LOGICAL PUZZLE WHERE WHAT YOU
SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.
 WE'RE NOT IN A MILLION YEARS
DOING THIS.
 OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR, WORK
TOGETHER.
 GET BACK.
 JUMP IN.
JUMP IN.
 Jeff: JENN ALREADY STEPPING
OUT.
JOE NOW IN.
JOE NOW WORKING THE PUZZLE AND
HE HAS FIRST PIECE.
SHIRIN QUICKLY WORKING TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THIS PUZZLE
BECAUSE ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT
IT WILL GO VERY QUICKLY.
BLUE COLLAR THROUGH NOW.
CHOOSE YOUR PUZZLE.
 YOU GOT THIS, JOE.
JOE WITH HIS THIRD PIECE.
 HOW DO I GET OVER THERE?
 Jeff: NOW BLUE COLLAR CAN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE
LADDER, FALLING FURTHER BEHIND.
JOE IS FLYING THROUGH A
DIFFICULT PUZZLE WHILE SHIRIN IS
STRUGGLING WITH WHAT SHOULD BE
AN EASIER PUZZLE.
 MIDDLE.
MIDDLE ONE.
 MY FINGERS.
MY FINGERS.
 Jeff: RODNEY TAKES THE
TEN-PIECE PUZZLE, THE ONE THAT
REQUIRES YOU TO SEE DIFFERENTLY.
JOE WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
 SHIRIN, DO YOU HAVE THIS?
 I KNOW WHAT IT IS, IT'S
JUST...
 YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: JOE WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.
NO COLLARS VERY CLOSE TO
FINISHING.
JOE DOWN TO THREE PIECES LEFT.
MAKE IT TWO PIECES LEFT FOR NO
COLLAR.
A HUGE VICTORY OUT OF THE GATE.
JOE IS ONE PIECE AWAY.
FROM WINNING THE FIRST CHALLENGE
IN "SURVIVOR: WORLDS APART."
AND HE HAS IT.
NO COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD!
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SECOND PLACE.
 STICK IT IN.
NO, FLIP IT.
TURN IT.
RIGHT THERE.
SIERRA HAS THE FIRST PIECE IN
HER PUZZLE.
GETTING A LOT OF HELP FROM HER
TRIBE.
SHIRIN STARTING TO PANIC HAS
MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS ON
WHAT SHOULD BE THE EASIEST
PUZZLE OUT HERE.
SHIRIN IS SWAPPING OUT.
MAX COMING IN NOW.
 SIERRA, LET ME SWITCH WITH
YOU.
 GO.
GO.
 Jeff: SIERRA SWAPPING OUT.
MIKE COMING IN NOW.
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE YOU.
 LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE.
 Jeff: MIKE WITH THE SECOND
PIECE.
 IMMUNITY IS OURS IF YOU CAN
DO THIS.
 Jeff: IT IS MIKE VERSUS
MAX.
MIKE WITH HIS THIRD PIECE.
 BLUE COLLAR, HOLLER, HOLLER.
 Jeff: MAX IS MAKING A LOT
OF PROGRESS WHERE SHIRIN
COULDN'T.
DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO
FINISH?
50 PIECES IS A LOT MORE THAN
TEN.
 THERE YOU GO, BABY.
INFORMATION IS A COMEBACK, BABY.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR WAS IN
DEAD LAST.
THEY HAVE NOW CAUGHT UP AND THEY
ARE VERY MUCH IN THIS.
 WE NEED THIS IMMUNITY.
 Jeff: MAX HAS ONE-THIRD OF
HIS PUZZLE DONE, BUT WILL IT BE
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.
 WE'RE IN THIS GAME, MIKE.
 MIKE DOWN TO TWO PIECES LEFT.
 GOOD JOB, BLUE.
 IMMUNITY!
 YOU GOT THIS, MIKE.
 Jeff: MIKE DOWN TO ONE
PIECE LEFT.
HE COULD WIN IMMUNITY FOR BLUE
COLLAR AND KEEP THEM SAFE
SENDING WHITE COMER TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 SPIN IT AROUND 180 DEGREES.
YEAH, LIKE THAT.
?IEFLT AND HE HAS IT!
BLUE COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD SENDING WHITE COMER TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 YES, YES, YES, YES!
BLUE!
 HOLY COMEBACK, BATMAN.
 NEVER OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER.
 DAMN RIGHT.
 .
 Jeff: NO COLLARS,
CONGRATULATIONS.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT FROM
YOUR TRIBE.
BLUE COLLAR, NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM YOUR TRIBE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
MIKEY, TAKE THAT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
NO COLLARS, COME GET YOUR REWARD
AND HEAD BACK THE CAMP.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: NICE WORK.
BLUE COLLARS, NOT A MASSIVE FIRE
MAKING KIT, BUT IT WILL GET THE
JOB DONE.
HERE'S FLINT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK THE
CAMP.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT FOR
YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WHITE COLLAR, SOMEBODY FROM YOUR
TRIBE WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON
VOTED OUT AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
YOU HAVE A VERY INTERESTING
AFTERNOON AWAITING YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK THE
CAMP.
WE'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 OH, MY GOD, THE CHALLENGE
TODAY WAS A DISASTER.
A DISASTER.
I MEAN, WE WERE IN THE LEAD
UNTIL THE VERY END.
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY SHIRIN AND
CAROLYN.
THEY WERE THE WEAKEST LINKS ON
OUR TEAM.
 WE WERE IN THE LEAD.
WE STARTED OFF FIRST.
AND IT WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE.
SHIRIN SAID FROM THE START THAT
SHE'S GREAT AT PUZZLES, BUT WE
LOST THE CHALLENGE, WHICH IS
FINE BECAUSE YOU GOT TO STEP UP,
RIGHT?
 YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK ABOUT
IT?
 I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT
NEEDS TO HAPPEN, BUT NO ONE
WANTS TO START DOING IT.
SHALL WE MAKE A SCHEDULE LIKE A
CALENDAR?
 THIS IS SO WHITE COLLAR.
 IT'S GOING TO BE A GIRL
TONIGHT, WE ALL KNOW THAT.
 I'M GOING TO GET WATER.
I NEED TO DRINK ABOUT 17 OF
THESE.
 EVERYONE IS GOING TO SEE THE
GIRLS AS WEAKER THAN THE GUYS.
I KNOW WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER,
BUT ONE OF US IS GOING HOME
TONIGHT, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
 SHOULD WE TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY?
 WE SHOULD.
 FIRST THINGS FIRST, I'M --
YOU CRUSHED THAT SIDE OF THE
CHALLENGE.
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHAT'S YOUR INITIAL...
 WHERE DID IT ALL FALL?
HER.
 SHIRIN.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?
 DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT THE
ONE THING SHE HAS IS A CLEAR
VOICE.
AND CAROLYN DIDN'T WANT THE PUT
HER NECK ON THE LINE.
 AS A BUSINESS PERSON, I
EXPECT PEOPLE TO DELIVER.
IF YOU DON'T DELIVER, THAT'S A
PROBLEM.
SHIRIN WAS WEAK PHYSICALLY TODAY
AND SHE DIDN'T PERFORM DURING
THE PUZZLE.
CAROLYN IS PLAYING THE SAFE
ROLE.
SHE'S NOT VOLUNTEERING TO PUT
HERSELF OUT THERE, SO I'M
LEANING TOWARD CAROLYN AT THIS
POINT.
IF WE SAY CAROLYN, I CAN
CONVINCE JOAQUIN THAT'S THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
THE HARD PART IS TO GET THE
THREE GUYS TO VOTE TOWARD
CAROLYN?
 WHAT?
 ARE YOU GOING WITH CAROLYN?
 SHIRIN FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT
LETTING US DOWN.
 WHAT I'M PISSED ABOUT IS
CAROLYN IS NEVER GOING TO STEP
UP TO TAKE A ROLE WHERE SHE'S
TESTED.
 THAT CAN BE A GREAT WAY TO
GET AHEAD IN THIS GAME.
 EXACTLY.
 I'M WORRIED ABOUT SO.
SHE'S GONE OFF WITH EVERYBODY.
IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THE TRIBE
STRONG, YOU GOT TO GO WITH THE
WEAKEST LINK.
THEY MIGHT WANT ME OUT BECAUSE
I'M THE OLDEST PERSON ON THE
TRIBE.
SO WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE
THINKING EITHER ME OR SHIRIN.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.
 I HAVE ONE PERSON SET IN MIND
ALREADY.
I ALREADY MADE MY DECISION.
 YEAH.
I'M VERY...
 YOUR NAME HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT
UP.
 SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I'M NOT
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT?
 NOT ON MINE.
YOU HAVE MY WORD.
 I CAN ACTUALLY VOUCH FOR
THAT.
 WELL, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
 WHITE COLLAR PEOPLE HAVE
INTERPERSONAL SKILLS TO KNOW
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LYING, AND I
THINK SO LIED ABOUT THE CLUE
WITH THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
I DON'T TRUST HER.
SHE'S PLAYING ME JUST LIKE SHE'S
PLAYING EVERYBODY ELSE, AND
RIGHT NOW I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE.
 HERE'S THE DEAL.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO START
GETTING ALL FREAKED OUT, BUT
YOUR NAME HAS COME UP.
 RIGHT.
 BUT I WANT STRENGTH.
AND YOU'VE PROVEN TO BE NOTHING
BUT STRONG.
 OH, MY GOD.
I KNEW MY NAME WAS COMING UP AND
SO WAS WALKING ALL ALONG.
I'M THINKING SO BROUGHT MY NAME
UP POINT BLANK.
 IT HAS TO BE A GIRL TONIGHT,
BECAUSE THE GUYS ARE STRONGER,
SO IF IT'S NOT ME, IT'S ONE OF
THOSE TWO.
 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IDOLS.
 I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM
HAVE THE IDOL.
I KNOW THAT THEY DON'T.
 BECAUSE?
 BECAUSE I GOT THE IDOL.
I'M BRINGING IT TO TRIBAL.
 THERE MAY BE ABSOLUTELY ZERO
REASON, AND WITHOUT EVEN HAVING
A FURTHER CONVERSATION BETWEEN
ME AND YOU, OF YOU NEEDING TO
PLAY IT.
 I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, SO I KNOW I'M NOT GOING
HOME TONIGHT, BUT I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO USE IT TONIGHT.
I WANT TO GO THERE FEELING
COMFORTABLE THAT IT'S NOT ME.
SO I NEED TO GET SO OUT.
SO'S TRYING TO ANGLE ME OUT.
I SAY IT'S GOT TO BE HER.
 I KIND OF THINK WE SHOULD
VOTE FOR SO.
 SHIRIN, CAROLYN AND I HAVE
BEEN TRUE TO EACH OTHER SINCE
DAY ONE, BUT MOST OF ALL WHAT I
WANT IS TO MAKE SURE I AM WITH
THE NUMBERS.
 IF SHE'S SENDING ME HOME, I'M
VOTING HER OUT TONIGHT.
 THE NAMES ON THE TABLE
TONIGHT ARE CAROLYN AND SO.
CAROLYN STANDS OUT BECAUSE SHE'S
OLDER.
THAT'S JUST THE SORT OF SMALL
DIFFERENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU AN
OUTSIDER ON A SMALL TRIBE OF SIX
MEMBERS.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
EQUATION IS SO.
SHE'S CERTAINLY PUT HERSELF INTO
A DIFFICULT POSITION WHEN SHE
CHOSE TO LIE TO THE REST OF THE
TRIBE ABOUT THE CHOICE THAT SHE
AND JOAQUIN MADE.
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 I THINK WE NEED TO GO AFTER
THE BIG MAN.
SHE'S THE WILD CARD.
THERE'S THREE OF US, THERE'S SO
AND JOAQUIN AND THERE'S THE BIG
MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THIS
READ?
 WELL, ON THE ONE HAND, YOU
HAVE PEOPLE WHO LIED TO THEIR
FELLOW TRIBE MATES.
THAT SAID, IT'S COMPLICATED BY
THE FACT THAT SO TORE THROUGH
THOSE KNOTS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN I THINK
ABOUT TRUST, CAROLYN THINKS
SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM, I CAN'T SAY
A BAD THING ABOUT HER.
 HERE'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,
WE NEED NUMBERS AND WE NEED
PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND
BE LOYAL.
 TONIGHT'S VOTE, FIT JUST
WOULD BOIL DOWN TO PHYSICAL
STRENGTH, IT WOULD HAVE TO GO IN
THE FACE OF CAROLYN BECAUSE
SHE'S OLDER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE
ON THE TRIBE.
 I LOOK SMALL BUT I ACTUALLY
PULL A LOT OF WEIGHT.
 ON THE FLIP SIDE, IF IT'S
INTEGRITY, ALL ARROWS WOULD BE
POINTED AT SO, BUT CAROLYN
CHANGED A LOT BY TELLING ME SHE
HAD AN IDOL.
 I DON'T THINK I NEED THE PLAY
IT TONIGHT.
 THE LOGICAL ARGUMENT IS THAT
CAROLYN SHOULD BE FIRST ONE TO
GO.
I KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THE
IMMUNITY IDOL CAN BE.
TONIGHT'S VOTE CAN GO EITHER
WAY, BUT I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE
THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE
SHOCKED.
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH, DIP
IT IN THE FLAME AND GET FIRE.
IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPENING
DILEMMA.
JOAQUIN, YOU WERE PICKED THE
FIRST REPRESENTATIVE AND THEN
YOU PICKED SO.
YOU TWO HAD TO GO BACK AND MAKE
A DECISION ON BEHALF OF YOUR
TRIBE.
HOW DID THAT GO DOWN?
 IT WAS A DECEIVE BOX, A
NEUTRAL BOX AND THERE WAS AN
HONEST BOXMENT AND WE WENT WITH
THE NEUTRAL BOX.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, WHAT WAS YOUR
SENSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON?
 JEFF, I'M A BIG FAN OF THE
SHOW.
THIS IS SEASON 30.
AND THERE ARE BIG HOLES IN THAT
STORY.
I THINK THAT THERE WAS A CLUE TO
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND THEY
WERE BEING DISHONEST ABOUT WHAT
HAD GONE DOWN.
 Jeff: MAX, YOU SEE THESE
TWO FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THAT
WAS FIRST TEST OF TRUST.
 JEFF, I'M NOT ANGRY AT THEM
OR DISAPPOINTED IN THEM FOR
MAKING THAT DECISION, I WOULD
HAVE MADE THAT SAME DECISION
PROBABLY MYSELF.
I JUST WOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER
JOB OF LYING ABOUT IT.
 Jeff: SO HOW DOES THIS SIT
WITH YOU?
 IT'S A LITTLE HEARTBREAKING
FOR IT TO COME OUT THIS WAY.
BOTTOM LINE IS, THE FOUR OF US
ARE REALLY STRONG.
AND I'M JUST HOPING THAT, YOU
KNOW...
 THE FOUR OF US?
 OH, THIS IS INTERESTING.
AND WHO ARE THEY?
 TYLER, MAX, JOAQUIN AND SO.
 Jeff: SO CAROLYN, SHIRIN,
YOU ARE NOT IN THE CORE FOUR,
WHICH IS NOT GOOD IN A GROUP OF
SIX.
 BAD.
A GAME IS AFOOT.
 A WISE MAN ONCE SAID.
 Jeff: CAROLINE, HOW DOES
THIS FEEL FOR YOU THE HEAR THE
CORE FOUR EXIST?
 I'M THE OLDEST ONE OUT HERE
FIRST, PERSON YOU THINK YOU
CAN'T DO ALL THE CHALLENGES AND
EVERYTHING ELSE, AND YET MAX AND
SHIRIN HAVE BEEN TOGETHER WITH
ME FROM DAY ONE.
 SO IS MAX LYING TO ME THEN?
 I THINK MY NAME IS ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
 ACTUALLY, YES, WE WERE VOTING
YOU OUT TONIGHT.
WE DECIDED THAT YOU ARE THE
WEAKEST LINK.
 YOU TOLD ME SPECIFICALLY THAT
IT WAS SHIRIN.
 YES, I HAD TO TELL YOU THAT.
EVERYONE SAT HERE AND SAID, WE
HAVE TO TELL CAROLYN THAT WE'RE
VOTING SHIRIN.
 I THINK YOU'VE LIED TO ME
FROM DAY ONE OBVIOUSLY.
 YES, I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.
 OKAY.
WELL, GOOD.
I DON'T TRUST YOU EITHER.
 YOU KNOW THESE TWO LADIES UP
HERE WERE OUR WEAKEST.
 WHAT DESCRIBES WEAKEST
BECAUSE YOU OPENED A NEW KNOTS?
HOW EXCITING IS OPENING KNOTS?
I THINK ANY ONE OF US COULD HAVE
STEPPED UP TO OPEN A NEW KNOTS.
 TYLER, DO YOU AGREE?
 I THOUGHT THE REASON WE TOOK
OVER THIS CHALLENGE TODAY WAS
BECAUSE OF SO.
BECAUSE OF HER FOCUS AND THE WAY
SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE ALL 20 OF
THOSE KNOTS THROUGH.
IT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
IT'S WHAT KEPT US IN THE GAME.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE
WERE TRYING TO PLAY AS A TEAM
AND I WAS TRYING TO BE A TEAM
MEMBER.
THE GAME STARTED OUT AND JOAQUIN
HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE, ULTIMATELY
WE GOT CAUGHT, BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO TEAM CHALLENGES, I'M THERE
FOR THE TEAM.
I SHOWED THAT TODAY.
 AS OPPOSED TO ME NOT BEING
THERE?
 NO, YOU DIDN'T STEP UP ONCE
AT ANY SINGLE CHALLENGE.
YOU CHOSE TO STAY SAFE AND NOT
ATTACK ANYTHING.
 OH, REALLY, BECAUSE I HAVE
BEEN WORKING MY ASS OFF IN CAMP,
OH, BY THE WAY, I AM JUST AS
ATHLETIC AS ANYONE ELSE.
SO THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD PUT
MY NAME DOWN TODAY BAFFLES ME.
 Jeff: TYLER, WITH ONLY SIX
PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO BE RIGHT IN
WHO YOU VOTE OUT.
 JEFF, OUR COMPETITION IS
AGAINST THOSE OTHER GUYS.
WE MAKE THE WRONG CALL TONIGHT,
AND WE GO IN PHYSICALLY WEAKER
AND EMOTIONALLY WEAKER, WHATEVER
WEAKER FOR ANOTHER CHALLENGE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK
HERE WITH YOU.
 Jeff: MAX, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW?
 JEFF, I AM THANKING THE
"SURVIVOR" GODS FOR PROVIDING ME
WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR, AND THIS
IS A WICKED DOWNPOUR AND LOTS OF
DRAMA.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GETTING BOTH
SO FAR.
ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JOAQUIN, YOU'RE UP.
 I HAVEN'T TRUSTED YOU FROM
THE BEGINNING.
YOU'VE LIED TO ME FROM DAY ONE.
I HOPE IT'S YOU AND NOT ME
TONIGHT.
 WE HAVE THE KEEP THE TRIBE
STRONG, AND YOU'RE THE LESSER OF
TWO EVILS.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE CAROLYN.
SO.
CAROLYN.
THAT'S TWO VOTES FOR CAROLYN.
SO.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES CAROLYN.
TWO VOTES SO.
SO.
THAT'S THREE VOTES SO, TWO VOTES
CAROLYN.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF WHITE
COLLAR VERSUS BLUE COLLAR VERSUS
NO COLLAR.
SO, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
SO, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: WELL, THERE'S NO
DOUBT YOU GUYS ARE PLAYERS.
BIGGER QUESTION IS: ARE YOU GOOD
PLAYERS?
DID YOU MAKE THE RIGHT MOVE
TONIGHT?
TIME WILL TELL.
ONLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT COMING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU GO BACK THE
CAMP WITH FIRE IN THE FORM OF
FLINT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK THE CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"... WHITE COLLAR TAKES
ON THE NO-COLLAR MENTALITY.
 WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND HERE?
 NOT EVEN CLOSE.
 Jeff: WHILE NINA IS TAKING
ON HER ENTIRE TRIBE.
 DON'T TOUCH ME.
YOU THINK MY TRIBE WOULD TRY TO
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I BELONG.
 THIS MOMENT IS MY WORST
NIGHTMARE.
I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED I'D
BE SITTING HERE FIRST ONE VOTED
OUT.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE
-- -- THEY DEFINITELY MADE
A MISTAKE.
THEY KICKED OFF SOMEONE WHO WAS
CLEARLY AN ASSET IN CHALLENGES.
THIS HURTS A LOT.
I'M TRYING TO ABSORB THE SHOCK
OF IT ALL
