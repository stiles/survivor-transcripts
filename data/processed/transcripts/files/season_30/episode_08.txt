 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR."
AFTER THE MERGE, RODNEY HAD
CONTROL OF THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE
AND A SECRET ALLIANCE WITH WILL,
TYLER AND CAROLYN.
 I'M ALWAYS RIDING WITH
NUMBERS, BABY.
HEY, LOOKING BEAUTIFUL FOR
RODNEY, ISN'T IT?
 Jeff: FOR JOE, IT WAS A








DIFFERENT STORY, HIS NO COLLARS
AND SHIRIN WERE ON THE BOTTOM.
 WE'RE TOGETHER 100%.
WE HAVE BEEN SINCE THE
BEGINNING.
WE PLAN ON STAYING THAT WAY, AS
FAR AS I KNOW.
 Jeff: AND EVEN THOUGH HE
FOUND THE CLUE TO THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, THE MAJORITY
ALLIANCE WOULDN'T LET HIM OUT OF
THEIR SIGHT.
 HE'S GOT THE CLUE.
I HAVE TO FIND JOE BEFORE HE








FINDS THE IDOL SO WE CAN SEND
THIS GUY HOME AND IT'S NOT ME.
 Jeff: BUT IT WAS MIKE WHO
BEAT HIM TO THE PUNCH.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL ---FLIPPERS
NEVER WIN.
 IT'S LIKE A FEAR TACTIC HE'S
USING AGAINST HIS ALLIANCE.
 Jeff: SPARKS FLEW BETWEEN
DAN AND SHIRIN.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, HALI.
BUT IT WAS HALI WHO WAS SENT
HOME.
HALI, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A FAN
LIKE YOU CAN'T KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FLIP AND A
BLINDSIDE.
 DAN, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN ME.
 YOU'RE RIGHT, LITTLE MISS
KNOW IT ALL.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.
 I AM DEFINITELY ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE NUMBERS, BUT THE
HOPE IS THAT BLUE COLLAR WILL
START FRACTURING SOONER RATHER
THAN LATER, BECAUSE I STILL
THINK I CAN GO TO THE END.
BUT THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO
A MOVE AGAINST THE OTHERS?
AND IF THEY ARE, I WILL BENEFIT
FROM THAT.
SO ALL I CAN DO IS SHAKE THINGS
UP.
 WELL, MIKE, WHEN YOU GO TO
THE VERY END, I'M VOTING FOR YOU
TO WIN.
 THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ON
THE JURY.
 I WILL BE ON THE JURY AND I'M
VOTING FOR MIKE TO WIN.
 I DON'T BELIEVE DAN WHEN HE
SAID FLIPPERS DON'T WIN THE
GAME, FLIPPERS WIN THE GAME ON
THE RIGHT TIME.
THEY THINK I'M BLUE TO THE END.
I DON'T NEED NO MORE FRIENDS.
I NEED ZEROS IN MY BANK ACCOUNT.
I'M GOING THE TAKE DOWN THE
BLUES.
MIKE, SIERRA AND DAN, THEY AIN'T
GOING TO SEE IT COMING.
I'M WAITING FOR MY TIME.
THEY AIN'T GOING TO SEE IT
COMING.
I'M GOING TO HIT THEM WITH A
MIKE TYSON KNOCK-OUT PUNCH.
[THUNDER]
 HOLY CRAP.
 THE GIRLS ARE ALL WHATEVER.
I'M KIND OF STOKED NOW TO GET
VOTED OUT.
 JENN WAS SO CLOSE WITH HALI,
AND NOW SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
HERE.
I DON'T HARBOR ANY RESENTMENT
TOWARD JENN WANTING TO QUIT THIS
GAME BECAUSE I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DISLIKES
THESE PEOPLE, BUT FOR SELFISH
REASONS, I WANT HER TO STAY
BECAUSE I WANT TO STAY IN THE
GAME AND I WANT TO GO FAR.
I NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO GAIN A
NEW ALLIANCE.
MY NUMBERS ARE DONE.
MY BACK'S UP AGAINST THE WALL.
SO I NEED A NEW OPTION.
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.
 I WOULD BE WILLING TO
ENTERTAIN THAT THOUGHT.
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
THURST YOU.
PULLING SHIRIN IN, BECAUSE NO
ONE WOULD THINK I WOULD PULL HER
IN, IS A PERFECT STRATEGY TO GET
RID OF SOME OF THESE OTHER
THREATS THAT ARE IN THIS GAME.
LET ME ASK YOU WHO WOULD BE YOUR
NUMBER ONE TO GO OUT OF THIS
GAME.
 I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY CAROLYN.
CAROLYN'S GOT WILL IN HER
POCKET.
SHE'S GOT RODNEY AND TYLER IS
WITH HER.
 YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT, AS
WELL.
 THAT'S FOUR PEOPLE.
 SHIRIN'S SMART ENOUGH TO
REALIZE THERE'S A GROUP WITHIN
OUR GROUP.
WELL, I SEE IT.
YOU CAN'T HIDE.
THERE'S ONLY TEN PEOPLE HERE.
IF WE WERE TO COME UP WITH A
NAME AT TRIBAL AND YOU WERE TO
WRITE THAT NAME DOWN...
 I'M IN.
 THE BIGGEST THING RIGHT NOW
IS TO HITCH MY VOTE ON TO
SOMEBODY ELSE'S GAME PLAN AND
JUST GO ALONG WITH WHATEVER THEY
SAY FOR NEXT VOTE, BUT ONCE I'M
IN AND ONCE PEOPLE TRUST ME,
MAYBE I'M NOT IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT RIGHT AWAY, BUT I'M IN THE
PASSENGER SEAT BACK SEAT
DRIVING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU'LL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS
OF FIVE.
ONE PERSON AT A TIME WILL RACE
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.
ONCE YOU REACH A PLATFORM, THE
NEXT PERSON GOES.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FIVE PEOPLE AT
THE PLATFORM, ONE PERSON FROM
EACH TEAM USES A GRAPPLING HOOK
TO RETRIEVE RINGS FLOATING IN
THE WATER.
FIRST TEAM TO COLLECT ALL FIVE
WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: PREPARE TO BE HAPPY.
YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE
CHOCOLAT CAFEÉ.
FEATURING M&Ms, SNICKERS,
TWIX, DOVE.
 DOVE CHOCOLATE!
 Jeff: YOU WILL SPEND A
RELAXING AFTERNOON SATISFYING
YOUR HUNGER WITH SOME OF YOUR
FAVORITES FROM HOME.
NOW, I'M GOING TO WHET YOUR
APPETITE BY REMINDING YOU JUST
HOW PLEASURABLE M&Ms CAN BE BY
LETTING YOU EACH TASTE ONE.
 EVERYBODY GO.
I DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOU BACK.
 CHOCOLATE ON CHOCOLATE, BABY.
 OH, WOW.
 COMMITTEE.
 RIGHT.
 Jeff: OKAY.
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK, WHICH MEANS YOU GUYS WILL
DECIDE WHO MATCHES UP.
LET'S DO IT.
WE DID A SCHOOLYARD PICK.
IT IS MIKE, TYLER, SHIRIN, DAN
AND SIERRA.
THE OTHER TRIBE IS RODNEY, JOE,
JENN, CAROLYN AND WILL.
HERE WE GO, FOR REWARD.
"SURVIVOR" READY?
GO!
IT IS MIKE AND RODNEY TO SEE WHO
WILL GET REWARD.
BOTH GIVING 100%.

TWO OF THEsãu5EÑ AWKWARD SLIDES
IN THE HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR."
DAN NOW ON THE NET CRAWL.
WILL NOW DIVING INTO THAT NET

JENN INTO THE NET CRAWL.
SHE'S GOT NO PROBLEM.
BOTH WOMEN SWIMMING TO THE
BALANCE BEACH.
SHIRIN AND JENN NECK AND NECK.
JENN HAS MADE UP SOME TIME ON
SHIRIN.
EASY FOR JENN.

SHIRIN, NO.
CAN'T DO IT.
GOT TO GO BACK.
GO, RED!
RED WITH A BIG LEAD.
SHIRIN LOSING A LOT OF TIME.
JOE UP AND OVER.
JOE RUNS DOWN.
 COME ON, JOE!
 Jeff: SHIRIN TRYING AGAIN.
AND SHE MAKES IT ACROSS.
JOE THE FIFTH AND FINAL PERSON
FOR THE RED TEAM.
JOE MAKES IT.
GO, BLUE!
SIERRA IN THE WATER FOR BLUE.
RED STILL WORKING.
NOW TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS
CHALLENGE.
THERE ARE FIVE RINGS.
GOT TO GET ALL FIVE BACK.
SIERRA IS AT THE WALL NOW.
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE UP SOME
TIME FOR BLUE.
JOE TAKING OVER NOW ON THE
GRAPPLING HOOK.
JUST MISSES.
SIERRA'S GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT
BEAM.
 NICE SAVE, NICE SAVE.
 Jeff: SIERRA DOES IT.
SIERRA'S BACK FOR BLUE.
WE'RE DEAD EVEN AGAIN.
MIKE NOW ON THE GRAPPLING HOOK
FOR BLUE.
JOE GOING TO GIVE IT UP TO
CAROLYN.
MIKE SNAGS THE FIRST RING.
FOUR LEFT FOR BLUE.
 FASTER, BABY.
YOU GOT TO GO FASTER.
 Jeff: CAROLYN SNAGS ONE FOR
RED.
WE'RE TIED 1-1.
IT IS SIERRA NOW TAKING OVER FOR
BLUE.
SHE'S GOT IT.
BLUE LEADS 2-1.
JENN TOSSING FOR RED.
BEAUTIFUL TOSS.
CAN SHE TURN IT INTO A HOOK?
YES.
RED HAS THEIR SECOND.
WE'RE TIED 2-2.
MIKE WITH A GREAT TOSS SNAGS A
THIRD RING FOR BLUE.
 GOOD JOB, MIKE!
 Jeff: BLUE BACK IN THE
LEAD, 3-2.
 THIS IS BACK AND FORTH NOW.
 Jeff: SHE'S GOT IT.
WE'RE TIED 3-3.
THEY'VE BEEN NECK AND NECK THIS
ENTIRE CHALLENGE.
MIKE SNAGS THE FOURTH RING.
DOES HE HAVE IT HOOKED?
YES.
BLUE BACK IN THE LEAD.
4-3.
BLUE HAS ONE RING LEFT.
JOE LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH.
CAN HE HOOK IT?
HANGING ON, TRYING TO KEEP THAT
HOOK ON THE RING.
GOT TO GET IT ON THERE TO GET IT
BACK.
OH, HAD IT.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR RED.
MIKE GOT THE DISTANCE, CAN HE
LINE IT UP AND GRAB IT FROM
BEHIND HE MIGHT HAVE IT.
INCREDIBLE.
BLUE WINS REWARD AT THE CHOCOLAT
CAFEÉ!
[CHEERING]ól
ALL RIGHT, DAN, SHIRIN, TYLER,
MIKE, SIERRA, I THINK THAT'S THE
BIGGEST CELEBRATION I'VE SEEN IN
THIS GAME, EVEN WITH IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES.
 I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT
SNICKERS SINCE DAY ONE OUT HERE
ON THIS ISLAND.
AND WE'VE GOT SOME PICTURES.
 Jeff: JENN, WHAT'S THE
FEELING FOR YOU?
 UM, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS FEELING
IS UNLESS YOU'RE OUT HERE,
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR
ALMOST A MONTH, BEING IN A PLACE
THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT
TO BE IN.
THIS IS NOTHING THAT MOST PEOPLE
WANT, UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED THIS
GAME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS
FEELS LIKE.
 Jeff: JOE, YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.
 I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I FEEL A
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT WE SIGNED
UP FOR.
YOU KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO
BE OUT HERE, AND WE'RE NOT
GETTING EVERY LITTLE DELICIOUS
TREAT THAT WE GET BACK HOME, BUT
I'M STILL HAPPY TO BE HERE.
I MEAN, MAYBE NOT THE SAME FOR
HER, BUT THIS IS PART OF THE
GAME.
 Jeff: DAN, SHIRIN, TYLER,
MIKE, SIERRA, GOING TO BRING THE
BOAT IN, GOING TO TAKE YOU OVER.
RODNEY, JENN, WILL, CAROLYN,
JOE, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
 OH, DEAR LORD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME IN
 YOU GUYS.
 I WANT ONE OF THOSE.
I WANT ONE OF THOSE.
WE WALK UP TO A CHOCOLATE BAR,
JUST BAR, BAR, BAR OF CHOCOLATE.
 OH, LOOK AT THE BIG ONE.
 THERE WAS SNICKERS, TWIX,
EVERY COLOR OF M&Ms, BIG DOVE
CANDY, HUNDREDS OF CANDY BARS.
IT WAS AMAZING.
 I'M DIGGING IN ON THE SNIX.
 OPENING THAT SNICKERS AND
SMELLING THAT CARAMEL-Y PEANUT-Y
GOODNESS BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY
CHILDHOOD.
IT'S REALLY STRANGE OUT HERE
WHEN YOU ARE SO DEPRIVED OF THE
LITTLE AMENITIES HOW MUCH A
SNICKERS' BAR TRULY MEANS TO
YOU.
 I LOVE LITERALLY EVERY ONE OF
YOU.
WAY TO GO.
 I AM THE LUCKIEST PERSON OUT
HERE RIGHT NOW CONSIDERING WHERE
I WAS COMING FROM THE PREVIOUS
NIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL TO ALL OF
A SUDDEN WINNING THIS CHOCOLATE
PARADISE AWARD AND HAVING A DOOR
OPEN STRATEGICALLY WITH MIKE AND
SIERRA, IT'S LITERALLY NIGHT AND
DAY.
I SEE THE GAME FROM A NEW ANGLE
AND NOW I'M CHARGING FORWARD.
 FRIED CHICKEN TONIGHT.
 WE'RE GOING TO BE EATING
BETTER THAN THEM.
 NOT WINNING AGAIN, I'M LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE WORST THING I
CAN DO IS TO SULK IN ANOTHER
LOSS AND TO GET MAD THAT I
DIDN'T GET A REWARD.
 ME AND JENN, WE'VE LOST.
 SO WHAT I NEED TO DO, WE HAVE
TO LOOK AT THE POSITIVE THING.
WE HAVE A CHICKEN HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO EAT BECAUSE MY
STOMACH NEEDS TO TAKE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT OTHER THAN RICE AND
BEANS.
 LET'S GET FIRE GOING AND
WE'LL HAVE CHICKEN AND RICE.
SOUND GOOD?
 JENN DOESN'T LIKE KILLING THE
CHICKEN AND I GUESS SHE WANTED
THEM AS HER LITTLE BUDDIES
BECAUSE SHE LOST HER BUDDY HALI
AND SHE MAYBE TALKED TO THE
CHICKENS OR THOSE ARE HER LITTLE
FRIENDS.
 SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
LIFE GOES ON.
 THIS WOULD SUCK LESS IF THE
PEOPLE SUCKED LESS.
NO ONE ASKED ME IF WE COULD KILL
A CHICKEN, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
PRETTY MUCH MY CHICKENS AT THIS
POINT.
THEN THEY JUST GRABBED ONE OF MY
CHICKENS AND RAN OFF.
NONE OF THIS IS FUN.
I'VE GOT NOTHING OUT HERE EXCEPT
FOR DESPAIR.
 OH, MY GOD.
I MISS CHICKEN SO MUCH, MAN.
 DOING THE SAME DAMN THING
WITH THE SAME DAMN PEOPLE, BUT
YOU WONDER WHO THEM PEOPLE GOING
TO BE.
JEFF, I THINK I'M ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.
MY NAME CAME UP SIX TIMES
TONIGHT, JEFF.
IT COULD BE ME GOING.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
 OH, MY GOD.
NAILED IT!
NAILED IT!
 WELL, YOU KNOW, JEFF, IT
COMES BACK TO A STORY OF ME AND
MY FRIENDS IN MAINE.
[LAUGHTER]
 KEEP GOING.
DON'T STOP.3w-
DON'T STOP, MAN.
 JEFF, YOU GOT TO APPRECIATE
GOOD PEOPLE WHEN YOU COME BY
THEM.
 I AGREE.
 I AGREE.
I AGREE 110% WITH DAN.
 150,000%.
 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THIS
GOOD AT IMPRESSION, RODNEY.
 I'M HERE WITH RODNEY AND
THERE'S A PART OF HIM THAT
DOESN'T LIKE MIKE, AND IF I CAN
USE THAT TO MY ADVANTAGE,
ABSOLUTELY I'M GOING TO FRICKEN
USE IT.
SO HOPEFULLY I CAN WORK A LITTLE
MAGIC AND STAY IN THE GAME A
LITTLE LONGER.
 THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
LIES AND BETRAYING BECAUSE YOU
NEVER KNOW.
 TREE MAIL.
 OKAY.
READ IT.
READ IT.
 ONE BY ONE, FLAMES GET
SNUFFED.
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT GOES.
TO ENSURE YOU'RE NOT THE NEXT
ONE THE LEAVE, YOU BETTER KEEP
ON YOUR TOES.
 GAME ON, PEOPLE.
GAME ON.
 GOING INTO THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, I FEEL A TON OF
PRESSURE.
I HAVE REALLY NOBODY OUT HERE,
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ALL I
GOT AND TRY TO GET A WIN.
I'M 3-0.
HEY, LET'S MAKE IT 4-0.
 ME, JOE AND SHIRIN ARE ALL AT
THE BOTTOM.
THE MORE I ASK TO LEAVE, THE
LESS LIKELY I AM THE LEAVE.
IF THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP ME
AROUND, I'LL GIVE THEM A REASON
TO KICK ME OUT.
IF IT GOES DOWN TO US TWO, I'LL
GIVE YOU THE NECKLACE AT TRIBAL.
 YOU WANT TO GO REALLY?
 YEAH.
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.
I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU THE
SECOND WE GOT THE TRIBAL, AND IT
WOULD BE HILARIOUS.
 I BELIEVE YOU.
 BUT YOU'D RATHER WIN.
 I LOVE YOU, GIRL.
I REALLY WISH YOU'D CHANGE YOUR
MIND.
 JENN SAID, IF I WIN, I'LL
GIVE YOU THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
AND GO HOME.
SHE'S THAT SET ON LEAVING.
HOPEFULLY SHE'LL STICK TO IT
BECAUSE IT WILL DOUBLE MY
CHANCES OF WINNING TODAY AT THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
LOVE YOU.
 LOVE YOU TOO, JOE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
JOE, TAKING IT BACK.
 TAKES IT AWAY.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO BALANCE ON YOUR TOES WITH A
BLOCK WEDGED BETWEEN YOUR HEAD
AND THE TOP OF A FRAME.
THE LONGER THE CHALLENGE GOES,
THE MORE FATIGUED YOUR LEGS WILL
BECOME.
WHEN THE BLOCK FALLS, YOU'RE
OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY GUARANTEED A ONE IN
NINE SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.
LOSERS GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE SECOND
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS IN PLACE.
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR HANDS OFF
THE STRUCTURE.
YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE STRUCTURE.
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.
HERE WE GO FOR IMMUNITY.d0
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ENDURANCE.
IT'S GOING TO HURT AND IT'S
GOING TO HURT FAST.
JOE STRUGGLING EARLY.
HAS NOT LOST AN INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGE.
JOE IS 3-3 BUT EARLY HE IS
STRUGGLING IN THIS ONE.
REGAINS HIS BALANCE.
CAROLYN A LITTLE WOBBLY.
AND CAROLYN IS THE FIRST OUT OF
THIS CHALLENGE.
CAROLYN GENTLY SO YOU DON'T
DISTURB THE OTHERS SIT DOWN ON
YOUR FRAME.
WILL DROPS OUT.
JUST LIKE THAT CAROLYN IS OUT.
WILL IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
SHIRIN DROPS.
SHE IS OUT.
WE ARE DOWN TO SEVEN.
STAY FOCUSED.
BECAUSE IF YOU DRIFT, YOU WILL
DROP.
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
YOU WANT TO DROP ONLY WHEN YOU
HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY BIT OF YOUR
ENERGY BECAUSE TONIGHT MIGHT BE
THE TRIBAL YOU NEED TO SURVIVE.
JOE STRUGGLING AGAIN.
A LOT OF MOVEMENT WITH THAT
BLOCK FOR JOE, BUT HE'S
RECOVERED AGAIN.
AND STILL IN IT.
RODNEY STARTING TO SLIP.
HE'S RIGHT ON TENSION OF HIS
FRAME.
RODNEY IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
THAT'S HOW FAST IT CAN HAPPEN.
ONE LITTLE MOVEMENT, THE BLOCK
MOVED, HE WAS OUT.
DAN IS OUT.
BE MINDFUL OF THE OTHERS.
 SERIOUSLY.
STOP.
GOD.
JOE'S BLOCK NOW IS REALLY IN AN
AWKWARD SPOT.
HE'S USING THE TOP OF HIS SKULL,
BUT HE'S ONLY GOT THE EDGE OF
THE BLOCK TRYING TO MANEUVER IT
BACK.
THAT CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE, THE
POSITION HE'S IN.
SIERRA IS OUT.
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.
JOE'S BEEN WOBBLING THIS ENTIRE
CHALLENGE, BUT HE'S STILL IN IT.
NOBODY HAS WON AN INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGE IN THIS GAME THIS
SEASON.
OTHER THAN JOE.
GOT TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM FAIL
TODAY.
JOE IS OUT.
JOE NO CHANCE OF CONTINUING HIS
STREAK.
JOE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE
MERGE VULNERABLE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.
IT IS JENN, TYLER AND MIKE.
FITTINGLY, A NO COLLAR, A WHITE
COLLAR AND A BLUE COLLAR.
MIKE'S BODY STARTING TO SHAKE A
LITTLE BIT, STARTING TO TWITCH.
TYLER NOW STARTING TO TWITCH A
BIT.
STARTING TO SHOW THE EARLY SIGNS
OF FATIGUE.
YOUR BODY STARTING TO MOVE A
LITTLE BIT.
JENN VERY SOLID.
HAS NOT WAVERED SINCE THIS
CHALLENGE BEGAN.
MIKE WOBBLING.
MIKE CANNOT RECOVER.
MIKE WITH NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY
TONIGHT.
IT IS NOW JENN AND TYLER
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY ON DAY 24.
STILL LOOKING VERY STRONG, LIKE
STATUES.
BEEN UP THERE 30 MINUTES NOW.
 OUTSTANDING.
 AWESOME.
 Jeff: A LONG TIME TO STAND
IN THIS POSITION.
JENN A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT IN
HER HEAD.
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS DANGEROUS.
JENN GOING TO HAVE TO DIG IN
RIGHT NOW.
TINY LITTLE TWITCHES HAVE WORKED
THEIR WAY UP TO THE TOP.
 KEEP FIGHTING, Y'ALL.
 Jeff: TYLER FIGHTING
THROUGH IT, STILL TWITCHING BUT
STILL STRONG.
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT
BLOCK STAYS BETWEEN YOUR HEAD
AND THE TOP OF THE FRAME.
AS LONG AS IT DOES, YOU'RE STILL
IN THIS.
YOU KNOW HOW FAST SOMEBODY CAN
DROP OUT OF THIS.
IT CAN HAPPEN IN A MOMENT.
JENN STARTING TO WOBBLE.
CANNOT RECOVER.
TYLER WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
HE'S SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 GOOD JOB, JENN.
THAT WAS AWESOME.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL
THAT FOR A FEW DAYS.
TYLER COME ON OVER.
TYLER SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, GUARANTEED A 1-9 SHOT
AT WINNING THIS GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, 24 DAYS
ON "SURVIVOR" IS TOUGH.
FOR SOMEBODY THAT WILL BE THE
END OF THE ROAD.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, SECOND MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 IS IT REALLY SAD THAT I
FOUGHT SO HARD IN THAT CHALLENGE
TODAY SO I COULD HAVE A TICKET
OUT?
EVERYONE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR
JOE, BUT I REALLY THINK THAT I
COULD DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT
HIM AND SCREW UP EVERYONE ELSE'S
GAME.
 I LOST SO I WAS ROOTING FOR
JENN.
I WAS LIKE, COME ON, JENN, KEEP
GOINGMENT BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
OUT.
SO, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT I'M
LIVING ON THE EDGE AGAIN.
I'M LIVING ON A LIMB.
I KNOW I'M ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK, BUT I'M GOING TO FIGHT.
I'M GOING THE FIGHT UNTIL THE
BITTER END.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I SUCKED SO
BAD AT THAT CHALLENGE.
 EVERYONE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR
YOU.
 EXACTLY.
 NOBODY KNOWS THE GAME AS WELL
AS I DO.
I'M RUNNING THE NUMBERS
CONSTANTLY.
AND I FIGURED OUT THE NUMBERS
LOOPHOLE.
 I'M PLAYING IT.
 BECAUSE OF THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND BECAUSE OF THE
WAY THE NUMBERS SHAKE OUT WITH
SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE BLUE
ALLIANCE AND THREE PEOPLE ON THE
OUT, THE BLUE ALLIANCE CAN AND
WILL SPLIT THEIR VOTE.
BUT IF JOE VOTES FOR JENN,
THERE'S A 4-4 TIE BETWEEN JOE
AND JENN.
JENN CAN'T VOTE FOR HERSELF AND
SHE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR JOE
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO GO HOME,
THAT LEAVES ME AS A SWING VOTE
TO DECIDE BETWEEN JOE AND JENN
GOING HOME.
 IT WILL PROBABLY BE FOUR HIM,
FOUR YOU?
 LOOK AT THE DREAMY LOOK IN
YOUR EYES.
 BUT COULD YOU?
 IF SHIRIN AND JOE VOTE FOR
ME, EVERYONE GETS SCREWED OVER
BECAUSE I KEEP JOE IN THE GAME.
IT SOUNDS PATHETIC TO ASK PEOPLE
TO VOTE FOR YOU, BUT I DON'T
CARE.
 I'D SAY 4-3.
 OKAY.
 IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?
IT'S SIMPLE.
DONE, RIGHT IN
 YEAH, 4-3.
 WHEREVER SHE GOES TODAY, I'M
GOING TO BE ATTACHED.
 THAT'S EASY.
 THE SCARY THING ABOUT
SPLITTING THE VOTE IS LITERALLY
ONE PERSON COULD MAKE THE
DIFFERENCE IN WHO YOU WANT TO GO
HOME AND THE GOAT GOING HOME.
SO I WANT SHIRIN TO VOTE JOE
TONIGHT IN ORDER TO GET JOE OUT
OF THIS GAME.
WE ARE DEFINITELY SPLITTING THE
VOTE, AND YOU'RE VOTING FOR JOE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
 YEAH.
 BUT I HAVE TO TRUST YOU.
 YEAH.
 HE COULD VOTE JENN AND THEN
JENN GOES HOME.
SO THE MORE VOTES WE HAVE FOR
JOE THE BETTER.
 YEAH.
THE THOUGHT OF VOTING BETWEEN
JOE AND JENN, ON THE ONE HAND, I
NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE IN A
POSITION TO VOTE FOR AN ACTUAL
FRIEND OF MINE OUT OF THIS GAME.
EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTS IT, I WANT
TO RESPECT HER WISHES AND LET
HER LEAVE THIS GAME IN PEACE,
BUT THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW
IS THAT JOE IS A MUCH BIGGER
THREAT.
 THE NEXT VOTE IS GOING TO
DETERMINE WHETHER WE GO TO THE
FINAL FOUR OR NOT.
 I AM BEING TESTED, AND LITTLE
DOES EVERYONE KNOW THAT I COULD
REALLY ROCK THE BOAT TONIGHT.
 I DON'T HAVE THE REAL HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND EVERYONE WAS
WATCHING ME, BUT I HAVE A LITTLE
BACK-UP PLAN.
JUST GET A LITTLE TIME BY MYSELF
OUTSIDE OF CAMP, I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED TO MAKE A FAKE
IDOL.
 I JUST WANT TO MAKE MY PLEA
THAT I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO BE
HERE.
 THERE'S NOTHING I COULD DO TO
SWING EVERYBODY.
 YEAH.
 YOU KNOW?
I'M SORRY.
 DON'T BE.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE SORRY
ABOUT.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE SORRY
ABOUT.
 THANKS, BROTHER.
 I'VE BEEN HAVING THIS IDEA TO
MAKE A FAKE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
I HAVE MY LITTLE STASH THAT I
SET UP.
THIS IS A PIECE OF WOODEN CRATE.
I HAVE PIECES FROM MY TORCH.
I MAKE JEWELRY, SO I'M GOING TO
MAKE A FAKE IDOL.
 WHERE'S JOE IN
 JOE'S GONE.
 JOE'S GONE?
 CANNOT LET HIM FIND THIS
IDOL.
 I'M GOING TO GO CHECK MY
SECRET SPOT.
 GO TO THE RIVER ACROSS.
 HEY.
 COME HERE FOR A SECOND.
 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
THE MORE CONFUSION THAT YOU CAN
THROW, THE BETTER.
AND IF NO ONE ELSE HAS FOUND THE
ACTUAL HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,
THAN THIS IS GOLDEN.
THIS IS SELLABLE.
 YOU ALL ARE GOING TO SPLIT
THE VOTE.
 WALK ME THROUGH A SCENARIO
THAT WORKS.
LY VOTE JENN IF YOU GUARANTEE
ME THAT THE NUMBERS WILL SWING
IN MY FAVOR TONIGHT, SEND HER
HOME, I WILL GIVE YOU MY IDOL.
 I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE IDOL
BEFORE TRIBAL.
 THAT'S THE THING.
I HAVE THE IDOL IN MY POCKET AT
TRIBAL, AND YOU FLIP YOUR VOTE,
I GIVE YOU THE IDOL TOMORROW.
 IF YOU GIVE ME THE IDOL, I'M
NOT GOING TO SEND YOU HOME.
 I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL TO HIS CLUE THAT HE GOT.
BUT IF HE HAS A DIFFERENT HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, YOU GIVE IT TO ME
TONIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
LEGITIMATELY, I WOULD SWITCH MY
VOTE.
MAYBE.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
HALEY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
SO I WANT TO START WITH THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
JENN, I WAS SURPRISED HOW WELL
YOU DID BECAUSE I STILL CAN'T
FIGURE OUT IF YOU ARE ENJOYING
YOUR TIME OUT HERE OR NOT.
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE APATHETIC.
I DON'T CARE, I JUST NEED SOME
CHOCOLATE, NO ONE LIKES ME.
THE NEXT MINUTE YOU'RE HANGING
IN THERE ALMOST WINNING
IMMUNITY.
CAN YOU NOT WANT TO BE HERE AND
WANT TO BE HERE?
 YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
THERE'S A LOT OF UNEXPECTED
THINGS IN THIS GAME, AND IT'S
JUST CERTAIN PARTS I REALLY
DON'T ENJOY, BUT CERTAIN PARTS I
REALLY DO.
LIKE I DIDN'T THINK RODNEY --
ANYTHING OF RODNEY, NOW HE'S ONE
OF THE FUNNIEST, CRAZIEST PEOPLE
I KNOW, SO I'M CONSTANTLY
LIKE... I DON'T LIKE THIS BUT I
REALLY DO LIKE, THIS AND I
WANTED TO WIN INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY FOR MANY REASON, BUT
ONE OF THEM WAS THAT WOULD BE
REALLY COOL TO GET THAT
NECKLACE.
 Jeff: WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH THAT NECKLACE, SINCE YOU
DON'T REALLY CARE?
 I WOULD GIVE IT TO JOE.
JUST TO SEE THE LOOK ON EVERYONE
ELSE'S FACES, BECAUSE THEY WOULD
ALL BE SO PISSED.
 Jeff: WHY JOE?
WHY WILL THAT BE ENTERTAINING?
 BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL VOTING
FOR HIM.
100%.
THE SECOND JOE DOESN'T WIN
IMMUNITY, EVERYONE IS VOTING FOR
JOE.
 Jeff: BUT HAD YOU WON
IMMUNITY, YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN
IT TO HIM SO HE WOULD STILL BE
HERE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
100%.
 WHY DON'T YOU DO THE LATEST
NO COLLAR MOVE OF ALL, GET UP
AND WALK OUT.
 THAT'S QUITTING.
I DON'T QUIT.
 Jeff: JOE, HOW DOES IT SIT
WITH YOU.
YOU WERE THIS CLOSE TO HAVING
IMMUNITY BECAUSE JENN ALMOST
BEAT TYLER.
 I WAS ROOTING FOR HER THE
WHOLE TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
HERE.
I WANT TO PLAY.
I HAVE WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE TO
BE HERE.
AND I'M NOT READY TO GO.
I MEAN, JENN, SHE'S ALREADY QUIT
MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
PHYSICALLY, SHE'S NOT GOING TO
STRATEGIZE, SHE'S JUST KIND OF
GETTING PULLED ALONG FOR THE
RIDE NOW BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT
SAY, I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO JENN
AT THE END BECAUSE SHE . EVEN
PLAY THE GAME.
AND I LOVE THIS GAME TOO MUCH TO
JUST NOT FIGHT FOR IT.
AND, YEAH, I WOULD HAVE TO WIN
THE NEXT NINE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES TO GET CLOSE TO THAT
GOAL, BUT AT LEAST I'D MAKE IT
FUN.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, AS A MASSIVE
FAN, HOW DOES THIS SIT WITH YOU?
YOU HAVE ONE PERSON SAYING SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE CARED IF YOU VOTED
HER OUT, BUT NOT WILLING TO FALL
ON THE SWORD AND WALK OUT NOW.
 YEAH, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
HERE, BUT I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND WHY.
LIKE, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,
I'VE ACTUAL LISTEN BEEN ABLE TO
STRATEGIZE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
WITH JENN IN A WAY THAT I
HAVEN'T TOTALLY CONNECTED WITH
JOE.
EVERYBODY ELSE HERE WANTS JOE
OUT.
THEY SEE HIM AS A BIGGER THREAT,
AND IT'S TO MY BENEFIT TO HAVE
HER STAY AND TO HAVE JOE GO
BECAUSE SHE'S A BETTER STRATEGIC
ALLY TO ME, BUT THE FACT THAT
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
HERE MAKES ME LOOK LESS
THREATENING, MAKES THEM WANT TO
KEEP HER OVER ME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
 JEFF, I HAVE A QUESTION, CAN
YOU VERIFY SOMETHING FOR ME?
IS THIS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL?
 Jeff: I CANNOT VERIFY THAT
UNTIL YOU DECIDE TO PLAY IT.
WELL, THE DETERMINING FACTOR IF
SOMEBODY STAYS HERE TONIGHT OR
IF THEY GO HOME.
OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TYLER, YOU'RE UP.
 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING
ON.
 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.
 JENN, GIRL, HOPEFULLY MY IDOL
PLAY BOUGHT ME ONE MORE VOTE AND
IT'S YOU AND NOT ME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS FOR
WILL.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR WILL WILL
STILL COUNT.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE JENN.
JOE.
JENN.
JOE.
DAN.
TWO VOTES JENN.
TWO VOTES JOE.
ONE VOTE DAN.
JENN.
THAT'S THREE VOTES JENN.
JOE.
TIED AGAIN.
THREE VOTES JENN, THREE VOTES
JOE, ONE VOTE DAN.
JENN.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JENN.
JOE.
FOUR VOTES JENN, FOUR VOTES JOE,
ONE VOTE DAN, ONE VOTE LEFT.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JOE.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JOE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 THANKS, JENN.
LOVE YOU ALL, GOOD LUCK.
 LOVE YOU, JOE.
 THAT'S, JOE.
 Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE
ILLUSTRATES A VERY BASIC
"SURVIVOR" STRATEGY -- TAKE OUT
A THREAT WHENEVER YOU CAN, WHICH
MEANS IF YOU ARE PERCEIVED AS A
THREAT, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING IS
RUNNING YOUR DAMN MOUTH.
WILL BLOWS UP ON SHIRIN.
BUT IT'S MIKE WHO COULD BLOW UP
THE GAME.
 HE FLIPPED.
 WHO DID I FLIP ON?
 WHACK JOB, YOU'RE RUINING IT
FOR YOURSELF.
 YOU'RE GOING NUTS RIGHT NOW.
YOU BETTER RELAX, BRO.
YOU BETTER RELAX.
 I TRIED TO STAY IN THIS GAME
AS LONG AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
IT'S HARD THE LEAVE THE GAME
WHEN I FEEL LIKE I HAVE SO MUCH
GAME LEFT TO PLAY.
BUT IT IS A GAME.
AND I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF
AN INDIRECT COMPLIMENT THAT
EVERYBODY WANTED ME OUT.
IT'S BITTERSWEET, BUT EVERY
SINGLE SECOND WAS WORTH IT OUT
HERE.
AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IN A
HEARTBEAT.
