YOURSELF.
THIS IS WHAT YOU FIND.








 MIKE WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
MIKE WINS.
 THIS GUY IS UNBEATABLE.
 MIKE WINS HIS FIFTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 WE DO THE HAPPY DANCE, BABY.
WE DO THE HAPPY DANCE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WELCOME TO THE
"SURVIVOR" LIVE REUNION SHOW IN
LOS ANGELES WHERE MIKE HAS JUST
WON OUR 30th SEASON.
CONGRATULATIONS.
 GOOD JOB, BABY.
 Jeff: NICELY DONE.
YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT
SOMETHING, BECAUSE YOUR BACK WAS
UP AGAINST THE WALL FOR SO LONG
THAT IT ALLOWED YOU TO PLAY MORE








AGGRESSIVELY AND A LOT LOOSER.
IS THERE ANYTHING TO TAKE FROM
THAT, EITHER FOR "SURVIVOR" OR
JUST IN LIFE IN GENERAL, THAT
WHEN YOU PLAY MORE LOOSELY, YOU
SEEM TO... IN LIFE DO YOU DO
BETTER DOING THAT?
 THE REASON I'M ABLE TO PLAY
LOOSELY IS BECAUSE SOMEBODY PAID
THE PRICE FOR MY SINS MANY YEARS
AGO, JESUS CHRIST.
HE ALLOWED ME TO DO THIS RIGHT
AND HAVE FUN...
 Jeff: I'M TALKING
SPECIFICALLY FROM A STRATEGY
POINT OF VIEW, YOU HAD... NO,
I'M NOT DISCOUNTING WHAT YOU
SAID, BUT I MEAN, YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE PLAYED WITH THAT CAVALIER
ATTITUDE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE...
YOU HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.
 WELL, YOUR BACK IS COMPLETELY
UP AGAINST THE WALL AND YOU KNOW
WHAT POSITION YOU'RE IN, IN THIS
GAME AND THE ONLY PERSON YOU CAN
TRUST IS YOURSELF, YOU'RE ABLE
TO MAKE MOVES THAT OTHERWISE YOU
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE
THE FORETHOUGHT TO MAKE.

 Jeff: SO FOR PEOPLE WHO GET
A SECOND CHANCE THE PLAY, WE'LL
REVEAL LATER, WHAT'S THE LESSON
FROM, LOOK, I PLAYED MUCH
BETTER.
 GO GET FIREWOOD.
 Jeff: THE BLUE-COLLAR WORK
ETHIC.
 THOSE FIREWOOD WALKS WERE
STRATEGY TALKS, LOOKING FOR THE
IDOL.
 Jeff: CODE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET FIREWOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THE MOMENT THAT REALLY PUT
YOUR BACK UP AGAINST THE WALL
AND ALLOWED YOU THIS AGGRESSIVE
APPROACH WAS WHEN, IN THE
AUCTION, MIKE TRIED THE MAKE A
MASSIVE MOVE.
 I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
 BUT YOU JUST BOUGHT IT FOR
$20.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
NICE.
MIKE, DID YOU...
 HE DIDN'T DO IT.
 Jeff: WOW.
YEAH, THAT ONE EVEN GOT ME.
THAT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.
SO NOW, AT THE FINAL TRIBAL, YOU
SAID TO DAN THAT YOU REGRETTED
GOING BACK ON YOUR WORD, BUT WE
WERE STILL IN THE GAME.
I'M CURIOUS, DID YOU REGRET THAT
MOVE?
 I REGRETTED GIVING HIM MY
WORD AND THEN TURNING BACK ON
THE WORD, I WOULD NOT HAVE
REGRETTED THE MOVE, THE MOVE WAS
RIGHT, FROM A GAME STANDPOINT,
THEY ALL GAVE YOU YOUR MONEY,
TAKE THE ADVANTAGE, GO, BUT IN
THIS GAME, I WAS NOT... THAT WAS
THE ONE TIME IN THIS GAME WHEN I
STOPPED PLAYING FOR ABOUT TWO
SECONDS.
 Jeff: SO IT'S A MISTAKE
BECAUSE YOU GOT ALL THE PLAME
FOR THE REST OF THE GAME AND YOU
DIDN'T GET ANY REWARD.
 HORRIBLE STRATEGY TO NOT TAKE
IT.
GAME PLAY STRATEGY, BECAUSE...
 Jeff: BECAUSE ONCE YOU
COMMITTED... YOU'RE GUILTY.
HAVE YOU MENDED FENCES.
AT THE VERY END, DAN SAID,
MAYBE, IF WE'RE BIG ENOUGH MEN,
CAN YOU DO IT?
 WELL, DAN AND I ARE BOTH BIG
ENOUGH MEN.
 MORE THAN BIG ENOUGH.
THANKS.
APPRECIATE THAT ANALOGY.
 WE FLEW UP TO MAINE TO HANG
OUT.
SO WE'RE PRETTY GOOD.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
 MORE THAN GOOD.
 Jeff: I'M GLAD TO HEAR
THAT.
RODNEY, FIRST OF ALL, HELLO,
LOOK AT THIS SUIT.
WOW.
 HEY, HEY...
 Jeff: HERE'S MY QUESTION
FOR YOU...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
GO AHEAD, SHOW THAT OFF.
HERE'S ANY QUESTION FOR YOU: HAD
YOU WON THAT FIRE MAKING
CHALLENGE, DO YOU BELIEVE YOU
WOULD HAVE WON THE GAME?
 I MEAN, I DIDN'T WIN IWILL
THE OF CHALLENGES.
LET'S BE REAL.
BLACK HOME I PLAY BASKETBALL, I
PLAY FOOTBALL, AND THESE
CHALLENGES DIDN'T FIT WITH WHAT
I WOULD DO.
SO THE SOCIAL GAME AND THE
HUSTLE --.
 Jeff: YES OR, NO YOU'RE
MAKING YOUR CASE TO THE JURY, I
THINK I HAD A REALLY GREAT SHOT
OF WINNING THAT GAME BECAUSE OF
THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
WHERE THE AUCTION IS WHERE
RODNEY SOLIDIFIED WHERE WHAT HE
HAD.
I HAD BLUES AND MY AXIS OF EVIL
AZUA LINES.
JOE, GET A BIG SHOT.
CAROLYN IS NOT IN THE FINAL
THREE.
RODNEY IS.
IT'S EVERYBODY ELSE BUT CAROLYN.
SHOW OF HANDS ON THE JURY, HOW
MANY VOTES DOES RODNEY GET IF IT
IS MIKE, RODNEY AND WILL?
WAIT, THREE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: SO YOU WERE IN IT,
BUT YOU'RE STILL SHORT.
HOW MANY FOR MIKE?
ALL RIGHT.
SO MIKE STILL PULLS THAT OUT.
CAROLYN, ARE YOU SURPRISED HOW
FEW VOTES YOU GOT GIVEN THE GAME
YOU PLAYED?
 PRETTY SURPRISED, YEAH.
I THOUGHT FOR SURE THAT I WOULD
GET A LOT MORE VOTES.
 Jeff: ARE YOU PROUD OF HOW
YOU PLAYED?
 I'M VERY PROUD OF HOW I
PLAYED.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: HOW MUCH, NOW THAT
YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T WIN, HOW
MUCH OF YOUR MIND IS OCCUPIED BY
THAT SECOND CHANCE BECAUSE
YOU'RE ON THE BALLOT?
 YEAH, IT'S PRETTY OCCUPIED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WHERE IS JOE?
JOE, JOE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 KNOCK IT OFF.
 Jeff: YOU KNOW WHAT,, I'M
NOT GOING TO PLAY YOU TAPE PIECE
BECAUSE IT REMINDS EVERYBODY HOW
COOL YOU ARE AND WE ALREADY KNOW
THAT AS EVIDENCED BY, WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME TONIGHT, SO
MANY PEOPLE, THESE ARE SOME OF
THE TWEETS I GOT FROM JEANETTE,
"BALL MY EYES OUT BECAUSE JOE
GOT VOTED OUT."
GAB SAYS, THAT'S FIRST TIME I
CRIED BECAUSE SOMEONE GOT VOTED
OFF OF "SURVIVOR"."
I LOVE JOE AND HIS PRECIOUS MAN
BUB.
IT GOES ON AND ON.
SO ARE YOU FEELING... YOU'RE ONE
OF THE MOST POPULAR OF 30
SEASONS.
ARE YOU FEELING THAT LOVE IN
YOUR DAILY LIFE?
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING
IT FROM FAMILY, FRIENDS, YOU
KNOW, STRANGERS ON THE STREET.
IT'S PRETTY COOL.
 Jeff: HOW ABOUT THIS.
THIS IS A QUESTION AND MAYBE AN
OFFER FROM ATKARI LO DOW, ARE
YOU SINGLE?
 I'M SINGLE.
I'M SINGLE.
YES.
YEAH.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: OKAY.
USUALLY GUYS HAVE TO APPROACH
WOMEN.
THAT'S NORMALLY HOW IT GOES.
ARE WOMEN APPROACHING YOU?
 A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT.
I'M USED TO TAKING A GIRL OUT TO
DINNER AND PICKING HER UP.
I THINK MORE PEOPLE WANT TO PICK
ME UP NOW.
IT'S... THE ROLE REVERSAL IS A
LITTLE... IT'S NICE TO SEE, THE
OTHER SIDE OF IT I GUESS.
 Jeff: I BET.
I BET IT IS.
JOE ALSO ON THE SECOND CHANCE
BALLOT.
IF ENOUGH OF YOU VOTED AND
ENOUGH OF YOU AT HOME WILL GET
SO' HIM PLAY AGAIN, MAYBE
CAROLYN PLAY AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.
STILL TO COME TONIGHT, WE REVEAL
NEXT SEASON'S CAST OF SECOND
CHANCES.
YOU GUYS CHOSE THEM.
THEY ARE READY TO GO.
THEY ARE ACHING BEHIND THE
STAGE.
UP NEXT, THREE OF THE MOST
CONTROVERSIAL PLAYERS FROM THIS
SEASON, THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE,
RODNEY, WILL AND DAN.
THEY MADE A LOT OF COMMENTS
ABOUT WOMEN.
WE'LL ADDRESS ALL OF IT.
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR: WHITE
COLLAR, BLUE COLLAR, NO COLLAR"
REUNION SHOW.
 WE'RE LIKE APPLES AND
ORANGES, BROTHER.
WE'RE LIKE CHICKEN APARTMENT AND
TUNA FISH.
 THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS
ABOUT, BABY.
I WENT ON EVERY SINGLE AWARD.
KEEP IT REAL, MAN.
I'M THE REALEST PLAYER
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
LIVE REUNION SHOW.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
WE'VE HAD ONE TOPIC DOMINATE A
SEASON.
THIS SEASON THE TOPIC WAS SEX
IM.
A LOT OF COMMENTS MADE TO AND
ABOUT THE WOMEN ON THE SHOW.
IT WAS RODNEY, WILL AND DAN THAT
TOOK THE MOST HEAT.
WE'LL START WITH DAN, WHO LIVED
UP TO HIS GOAL OF BEING
REMEMBERED.
 YEAH.
 WHEN YOU LISTEN LIKE A GIRL,
YOU JUST SMILE AND NOD, YES,
DEAR, I UNDERSTAND.
 YEAH, YOUR MOTHER'S A...
 CLOSE YOUR MOUTH, OPEN YOUR
EARS.
SHE LOVES TO PLAY THE VICTIM.
MY SCENARIO REALLY ISN'T MUCH
DIFFERENT THAN HERS.
 Jeff: SO YOU HAD DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE IN YOUR UPBRINGING?
 I'M AN ADOPTED CHILD.
MAYBE SHE'S AN IDIOT SAVANT.
I'M LEANING MORE TOWARD THE
IDIOT SIDE.
 SOMEBODY SLAP THIS WOMAN.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST SLAP
HER AND SHUT HER UP.
I'M ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO BE
NICE.
I TRULY AM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
 GO AHEAD.
BOO ME.
 Jeff: DAN, SINCE YOU WERE
VOTED OUT, YOU GUYS ALWAYS DO
PRESS.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY VOCAL IN THE
PRESS THAT YOU DID FEEL THAT YOU
WERE MISREPRESENTED AND SOME OF
YOUR COMMENTS TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT, AND I WANT YOU TO FEEL
HEARD, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT
FRUSTRATION OVERALL?
 I CERTAINLY DO HAVE THAT
FRUSTRATION.
A LOT OF THINGS THAT I SAID...
THAT COMMEND I MADE...
 Jeff: LET'S GO THROUGH
THEM.
 THE COMMENT IN THE ARE RIVER
ABOUT SIERRA, THAT WAS NOT
DIRECTED AT HER.
THAT WAS 100% OUT OF CONTEXT.
HOWEVER...
 Jeff: DAN.
HOLD ON.
WE'LL GET TO THEM.
LET'S START WITH A COUPLE THAT
YOU TOOK THE MOST HEAT ON
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IWILL THE
OF TIME.
 OKAY.
 THE SHIRIN COMMENT WHERE YOU
SAID, "SOMEBODY SLAP THIS WOMAN,
FOR LOVE OF GOD, SLAP HER AND
SHUT HER UP ALREADY."
WHAT'S YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH
THAT?
 NUMBER ONE, I HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT SHIRIN'S PAST.
I WOULD INNER HAVE MADE THAT
COMMENT.
 STOP THERE, BECAUSE NUMBER
TWO DOESN'T EXIST.
YOU'RE SAYING... ARE YOU SAYING
BY, THAT DAN, THAT IF THERE'S A
SITUATION WHICH IT WOULD BE
OKAY?
 OKAY, AGAIN, IF YOU WOULD LET
ME FINISH, I'LL TELL YOU.
 Jeff: OKAY.
 HOW MANY TIMES HAS ANYBODY
SAID, GOD, I COULD JUST KILL
THIS PERSON?
DO YOU GO HOME AND PLOT MURDER?
IT WAS AN EXPRESSION.
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.
I DID NOT MEAN IT LITERALLY.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, THE
PEOPLE AT HOME OR EVEN YOU.
I CARE ABOUT YOU.
AND RIGHT NOW, I AM TELLING YOU,
FROM MY HEART, I'M SORRY.
I AM GENUINELY TRULY SORRY.
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, AND I'LL
SAY IT AGAIN.
I OWN UP TO MY FAULTS AND I OWN
UP TO MY SUCCESSES.
THAT WAS A FAULT AND I'M SORRY.
I WAS WRONG.
HOWEVER...
 Jeff: DAN, HOLD ON.
WE CAN'T DO AN HOUR.
 I DON'T WANT TO DO AN HOUR.
 Jeff: I LOVE YOU --
 THIS IS NOT A SEASON ABOUT
THE NEGATIVITY.
I WANT THE SEASON TO BE ABOUT
POSITIVITY.
YOU ALWAYS TOLD THUS WAS OUR
SEASON.
 Jeff: I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
THIS WAS GOING TO GO, BUT YOU
SAID A LOT IN THE PRESS THAT WAS
NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THE SHOW, AND
ONE OF YOUR BIG COMMENTS WAS
WHEN YOU CALLED RODNEY'S MOM,
YOU SAID, YEAH, YOUR MOTHER IS A
WHORE.
RIGHT?
 YES.
 Jeff: YOUR FRUSTRATION
IS...
 AGAIN, OUT OF CONTEXT.
WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR FRIENDS, YOU
MAKE YOUR MAMA JOKES.
I HAD PASSED OUT AFTER THAT
WATER BUCKET CHALLENGE
WE HAD JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THOSE JOKES.
ALL OF THAT WAS LEFT OUT.
 Jeff: I DON'T WANT YOU TO
FEEL "60 MINUTES" HERE.
 NO I DON'T WANT TO.
 OKAY.
I PULLED THAT SCENE.
I PULLED THE RAW FOOTAGE OF THAT
SEABOARD -- SCENE.
BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT I
HAVE TO DEFEND THE SHOW I WORK
ON AND LOVE.
I'M GOING TO SHOW THE SCENE.
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL.
NEVER SHOWN.
THIS THIS IS RAW FOOTAGE.
 THROW ME UNDER THE BUS.
 Jeff: THIS IS ONE CAMERA.
IT'S VERY BORING.
YOU'LL SEE, WOW, THEY DO HAVE A
LOT OF DOWN TIME.
THIS MUST BE MADDENING, BUT
YOU'LL ALSO SEE THERE ARE NO
YOUR MAMA JOKES.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH
REWARD YOU HOPE NEXT ONE WILL
BE, WILL IT BE FISHING OR A
COMFORT, AND RODNEY'S RESPONSE
TO YOUR COMMENT ILLUSTRATES THAT
THERE WAS NO MAMA JOKES GOING
ON.
TAKE A LOOK.
 TOMORROW'S GOING TO BE
COMFORT, RIGHT?
 YES.
 EITHER COMFORT, I HOPE IT'S
FISHING GEAR TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU
 HELL, YEAH.
 I'D RATHER HAVE FISHING GEAR.
I'D RATHER EAT.
 I'D RATHER HAVE COMFORT ALL
DAY LONG.
 REALLY?
 YEAH.
 GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO
CATCH FOOD.
WE'VE GOT TO.
 BLANKET.
 WE WALK IN THERE AND JEFF'S
LIKE, LOOK AT ALL THIS FISHING
GEAR...
 RODNEY...
 I'VE GOTTEN LIKE FIVE HOURS
OF SLEEP.
 EVERY NIGHT.
ER NIGHT, NO WAY?
 YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.
YOU'RE THE EARLIEST ONE THAT
GOES TO WED AND THE LATEST ONE
THAT GETS UP.
 NO WAY.
 I LOVE YOU, BUT IT'S TRUE.
 THE CENSUS SAYS THAT YOU, IN
FACT, ARE THE SLEEPER.
 HATERS.
 HATERS.
 BECAUSE WE TELL THE TRUTH.
 THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THE FACT DOESN'T CHANGE THE
FACT.
 GO TO BED, DAN.
NOBODY ASKED YOU.
 YOUR MOTHER'S A [BLEEPED],
TOO.
 WHOA.
 WOW, YOU JUST TOOK IT TO A
NEW LEVEL.
YOU NEVER MENTION MY MOTHER,
BROTHER.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO THERE WAS... AND I WATCHED
ALL THIS FOOTAGE.
THERE WAS NO 30 MINUTES OF
JOKING.
SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT KNOW,
WATCHING THAT NOW, IS IT
POSSIBLE YOU'RE JUST NOT
REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY?
 CLEARLY, JUST BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIKE THE FACTS DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACTS, CLEARLY I'M
REMEMBERING IT WRONG.
 Jeff: HERE'S WHAT I'M
WONDERING, DAN, WORDS DO MATTER,
BUT SO DOES THE INTENTION BEHIND
IT.
I'M WONDERING IF YOUR INTENTION
IS WHAT'S COMING ACROSS, DO YOU
HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST WOMEN?
 I DO NOT HAVE A PREJUDICE
AGAINST WOMEN?
I DON'T HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST
ANYBODY.
IF I DISLIKE YOU, YOU'VE EARNED
THAT FROM ME.
PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME KNOW THAT I
WILL STAND UP... I'M WITH
RODNEY, WE'RE FROM NEW ENGLAND.
LY STAND UP AND DIE IF YOU FOR F
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
 Jeff: SO MAYBE INSTEAD OF
US MISREPRESENTING YOU ON THE
SHOW, MAYBE THIS IS CASE OF
YOU'RE NOT AWARE SOMETIMES OF
HOW YOU COME ACROSS TO PEOPLE
WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
FUNNY AND THEY DON'T TAKE IT
THAT WAY BUT YOU DON'T MEAN TO
BE HURTFUL.
 I CERTAINLY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE
HURTFUL.
I MET RODNEY'S MOM.
I MET RODNEY'S SISTER.
THE FIRST THING SHE DID, SHE
CAME UP TO ME AND GAVE ME A HUG
AND SHE GOES, "I KNEW YOU WERE
KIDDING.
I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEANT."
 Jeff: I THINK IT'S FITTING
BECAUSE YOU BRAVELY WORE A SHIRT
ON A NIGHT WHEN YOU KNEW THE
TOPIC WAS GOING TO COME UP THAT
SAYS, LET'S GET A SHOT OF IT,
BECAUSE I KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING, BUT IT SAYS MAIL
ESCORT.
IT'S SPELLED "MAIL" AS IN POST
OFFICE.
 Jeff: THAT'S MY POINT.
I WONDER IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
 IN THIS PC AGE IT'S SO EASY
TO SAY SOMETHING TO HAVE IT
COMPLETELY MISCONSTRUED.
THAT WAS NOT MISCONSTRUED.
 Jeff: I APPRECIATE...
 I ONLY MEANT TO BE FUNNY.
I APOLOGIZED TO RODNEY AND HIS
MOTHER.
I OBVIOUSLY PUT MY FOOT IN MY
MOUTH.
I'M A GUY WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND,
AND I DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT.
 Jeff: AND DAN, THIS DOESN'T
MEAN YOU WOULDN'T BE BACK ON THE
SHOW, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT.
THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS SHOW,
BECAUSE YOU DO TAKE A GROUP OF
PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF
LIFE, YOU FORCE THEM INTO
EXTREME CONFLICT TO WORK
TOGETHER BUT THEN VOTE EACH
OTHER OUT AND DO IT IN A WAY
THAT SOMEBODY WILL COME BACK AND
VOTE FOR YOU TO WIN.
IT'S A COMPLICATED GAME.
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE
INTERESTING IS YOU ARE SO
COMPELLING AND YOU WORK SO HARD
TO IMPRESS, SOMETIMES AS YOU
SAY, MAYBE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN
YOUR MOUTH AND YOU'LL LEARN
SOMETHING FROM THIS.
 BUT I DON'T WORK HARD TO
IMPRESS.
I TOLD TYLER, I GOT TWO MODES,
AWAKE AND ASLEEP.
THIS IS WHO I AM.
AND I SCREW UP A LOT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
 I EAT A LOT OF CROW.
 Jeff: WELL SAID.
WE STILL HAVE RODNEY AND WILL TO
DEAL WITH AND SECOND CHANCERS.
YOU CAN'T GET MORE "SURVIVOR"
THAN THIS TONIGHT.
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.
WE'LL COME BACK.
A LOT MORE SHOW LEFT.
 I DON'T NODE A FAMILY BECAUSE
MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER IS JUST
LIKE YOU.
HE VERBALLY ASSAULTED ME ALL THE
TIME.
 I DIDN'T VERBALLY SAUL YOU.
I JUST CALLED YOU OUT.
 SHUT UP.
 YOU PLAY THE VICTIM.
 YEAH, AND I AM A VICTIM OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AS IS MY
MOTHER, AND THAT IS WHY OUR
FAMILY WAS TORN APART, AND THIS
IS WHY I DO NOT HAVE FAMILY AT
HOME.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
REUNION SHOW.
A LOT OF TOUGH TOPICS.
WILL, MY IMPRESSION OF YOU FROM
THE MOMENT I MET YOU, WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THAT, IS YOU WERE
ALWAYS A GOOD GUY.
THAT'S HOW YOU CAME ACROSS.
THAT REWARD, I KNOW WHAT THE
TRUTH WAS.
YOU TOOK ALL OF IT AND GAVE IT
TO EVERYBODY.
THEY QUESTIONED YOUR INTEGRITY
AND YOU GOT UPSET, BUT TAKE ME
BACK TO THE MOMENT TO SHIRIN AND
I SAID, DO YOU WANT TO
APOLOGIZE, AND YOU SAID NO.
 AT THAT MOMENT, WHEN YOU WANT
TO APOLOGIZE, YOU WANT TO BE
SINCERE.
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE PERSON IS
GOING TO BE OPEN THE RECEIVE,
THAT AND WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN
THREE DAYS BEFORE, THAT SO I
KNEW SHE WASN'T OPEN TO HEARING
AN APOLOGY, AND I WASN'T SINCERE
ENOUGH TO GIVE ONE.
 Jeff: SO HAVE YOU
APOLOGIZED TO HER.
 I APOLOGIZED TO HER AT
PONDEROSA AND WHEN THE EPISODE
AIR, I SENT A TEXT TO HER.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, YOU'RE
SHAKING YOUR HEAD.
HE DIDN'T APOLOGIZE?
 AT PONDEROSA HE SAID, "IT'S
ALL A GAME, BABY GIRL, IT'S ALL
A GAME."
 THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
 Jeff: HOW ABOUT WE CUT TO
THE CHASE.
DO YOU FEEL HE'S APOLOGIZED,
SHIRIN?
 I DON'T FEEL LIKE HE'S GIVE
AN GENUINE APOLOGY.
I FEEL LIKE HE STOOD BY WHAT HE
DID UP THROUGH THE EPISODE,
AFTER THE EPISODE AND ONLY DAYS
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE PUBLIC
OPINION WAS LARGELY NEGATIVE DID
HE THEN CAVE AND SEND ME A WEAK
APOLOGY, AND I MEAN AT THIS
POINT, JONATHAN PENNER SAID,
"VALUES CHANGE BUT WRONG HAS NO
EXPIRATION."
THIS IS NO LONGER ABOUT ME.
WHAT HE DID TO ME WAS WRONG, BUT
FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT USING THIS
PLATE FORM TO RAISE AWARENESS...
 Jeff: WOULD YOU ACCEPT AN
APOLOGY?
BECAUSE I SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO
THE UNTHIS INTO SOMETHING
POSITIVE.
THIS WOULD BE POSITIVE IF
WILL... DO YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO HER?
 I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER,
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE PERSON I
AM.
I'LL TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER,
JEFF.
I WOULD WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO
SHIRIN'S FAMILY OUT THERE,
BECAUSE WHAT I SAID TO HER WAS
WRONG.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY
EXCUSES ABOUT BEING HUNGRY OR
TIRED BECAUSE WE ALL WERE.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A GENUINE
APOLOGY, AS WELL, LIKE I DID AT
POND ROW SYSTEM.
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT YOUR
BACKGROUND, JUST LIKE DAN, BUT
REGARDLESS OF THAT, I SHOULD
HAVE NEVER SPOKE TO YOU THAT WAY
AND I'M SORRY FOR WHAT MY WORDS
DID AND I HOPE YOU CAN TRULY
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU
HAVE TO FORGIVE, WHETHER IT'S ME
OR THE PEOPLE IN YOU PAST, TO BE
THE PERSON THAT GOD WANTS YOU TO
BE.
I'M TRULY SORRY.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ACCEPTED?
 FOR ME, TO BEGIN THE
FORGIVENESS PROCESS, I HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND WHY I DON'T HAVE A
SOUL AND WHY PEOPLE WITHOUT
SOULS NEED TO BE TREATED THAT
WAY, SO THAT HE WILL NEVER TREAT
OTHER PEOPLE THIS WAY IN THE
FUTURE, BECAUSE IF HE TREATS
OTHER PEOPLE THIS WAY IN THE
FUTURE, THAT'S ON ME, AND I
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
CAN WE START THE PROCESS?
YES.
 HE DOESN'T TREAT NOBODY THAT
WAY.
 Jeff: THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT "SURVIVOR" DOES, IS
IT FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE
THINGS YOU SAY AND THE WAY YOU
BEHAVE, NOT ONLY AS A CONTESTANT
UNDER EXTREME CONFLICT BUT JUST
AT HOME.
YOU WATCH AND SAY, I WOULD NEVER
SAY THAT.
YOU SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.
I HOPE AMITH ALL THIS
NEGATIVITY, WE CAN END THIS
SEGMENT.
I HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU
GUYS WITH RODNEY.
THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN TALK
ABOUT, BUT RODNEY, I'M
HEARTBROKEN THAT DESPITE BEING
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND PLAYING
A MASSIVELY COOL GAME THAT WAS
BROADCAST ON CBS, EVERY WEEK IN
AMERICA IN 140 COUNTRIES AROUND
THE WORLD, YOU WERE FORCED TO
ENDURE THE WORST BIRTHDAY OF
YOUR LIFE, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU.
JUST HANG TIGHT.
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR RODNEY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
 Jeff: HERE YOU GO.
GOT A LITTLE PHOTO.
A LITTLE HAT.
A HAT HERE.
AND A NOISE MAKER.
THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO OUR
S. 30 CAST.
THIS IS IT.
THE SECOND CHANCERS WILL BE
REVEALED NEXT.
THAT'S THE CAMRY -- CAMERA I WAS
LOOKING FOR.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
OUR 30th SEASON IS OVER.
TIME TO FIND OUT WHO WILL BE
PLAYING IN OUR 31st SEASON.
THESE ARE YOUR CHOICES.
YOU'LL BEEN VOTING.
TENS OF MILLIONS OF VOTES CAST
FROM SEASON 1 TO SEASON 30.
WE HAVE A "SURVIVOR" BUS OUTSIDE
READY TO START THE JOURNEY.
LOOK AT THAT.
BUT BEFORE WE DO THIS, I JUST
WANT TO SAY, THE FACT THAT ALL
32 OF YOU SHOWED UP AND BRAVED A
PUBLIC VOTE ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION, KNOWING SOME OF YOU
WON'T MAKE IT, SPEAKS TO THE
MOTIVATION THAT IT TAKES TO PLAY
THIS GAME.
AND I'M SORRY THAT ALL OF YOU
CAN'T PLAY.
I REALLY AM.
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WON'T GET
ANOTHER SHOT, BUT HERE WE GO.
GIVE US THE MUSIC, DAVID.
KELLY WIGGLESWORTH, SEASON ONE,
JUST GIVE US A LITTLE REMINDER,
JOE, OF WHAT SEASON ONE WAS
LIKE.
OVER 125 UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL, 125
MILLION DIFFERENT PEOPLE WATCHED
THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE WHEN
RICHARD HATCH BEAT YOU BY ONE
VOTE.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT A SECOND CHANCE SINCE
THEN, KELLY WIGGLEWORTH.
 15 YEARS AND YOU GOT A WATCH?
 Jeff: I HAPPEN SO HAPPY TO
SAY, KELLY WIGGLESWORTH, YOU
WILL GET A SECOND SHOT.
GET UP ON THAT STAGE.
WE HAVE OUR FIRST ONE.
ALL RIGHT.
SEASON TWO, KIMMIE CAPPENBURG
AND JEFF VARNER, "SURVIVOR"
AUSTRALIA.
KIMMIE MOST FAMOUS FOR GETTING
IN A FIGHT ABOUT A CHICKEN.
ARE YOU STILL A VEGETARIAN?
 I AM.
 JEFF STEPPED DOWN FROM A
CHALLENGE FROM PEANUT BUTTER AND
GOT VOTED OUT.
ARE YOU STILL EATING PEANUT
BUTTER?
 NO.
HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT IN 14 YEARS.
 KIMMIE CAPPENBERG, YOU WILL
GET A SECOND SHOT.
JEFF VARNER, YOU WILL GET A
SECOND SHOT.
GET UP THERE.
GET UP THERE.
LET'S KEEP THIS TRAIN MOVING.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW THE VOTE WENT.
PEOPLE LOVE YOU.
YOU WILL GET A SECOND SHOT.
WOW.
I SEE THE LOOKS ON THE FACES.
I EMPATHIZE WITH THE PAIN AND
THE ANTICIPATION YOU'RE FEELING.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET THIS, T-BIRD FROM
"SURVIVOR" AFTER CASH ONE OF THE
TOUGH ET CETERA SEASONS WE'VE
EVER DONE THAT.
WAS VERY DIFFICULT.
STEPHANIE FROM REDEMPTION
ISLAND, DIFFICULT FOR A
DIFFERENT REASON, YOU HAD TO
PLAY WITH RUSSELL.
AND P.GOLD MEDAL FROM CHINA,
KNOWN FROM YOUR FIGHT, VERY
CLOSE TO GETTING TO THE END.
ONE THINGS GOES DIFFERENTLY YOU
MIGHT HAVE WON THAT GAME.
ONE OF YOU WILL GET A SECOND
SHOT.
TWO OF YOU WILL NOT.
T-BIRD, YOU WILL NOT GET A SHOT.
I'M SORRY.
STEPHANIE VALENCIA, YOU WILL NOT
GET A SHOT.
P.G., YOU WILL GET A SECOND
SHOT.
GET UP ON STAGE.
THIS IS THE HEARTBREAKING PART.
I DO NOT LIKE DOING THIS.
I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE THIS
TOUGH.
SIERRA FROM BLOOD VERSUS WATER,
VENUS FROM BLOOD VERSUS WATER,
SAME SEASON.
SIERRA, THIS LOVELY LITTLE WOMAN
VOTED OUT HER MOM, AND VITUS
PICKED ON HIS BROTHER, AND BOTH
OF YOU WILL GET A SECOND CHANCE.
SIERRA WILL GET A SECOND CHANCE,
VITUS WILL GET A SECOND CHANCE.
LET'S STAY ON THIS SAME ROW.
JIM RICE, GREAT STRATEGIST, ONE
OF THE PRODUCERS' FAVORITE
PLAYERS OF ALL TIME.
WE FELT LIKE YOUR TIME WAS A
LITTLE SHORT, AND I'M SORRY TO
SAY IT'S GOING THE STAY THAT WAY
FOR NOW.
JIM, YOU WILL NOT GET A SECOND
SHOT.
I AM TRULY SORRY.
SABRINA THOMPSON, ONE WORLD, YOU
PLAYED THIS SEASON IN WHICH ONE
WOMAN, KIM, DOMINATED THE GAME,
BUT YOU MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO
THE END.
IN ANY OTHER SEASON, IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO WIN, YOUR
SECOND CHANCE WILL HAVE TO WAIT.
YOU WILL NOT GET A SECOND
CHANCE.
TERRY DIETZ FROM PANAMA, HE
FINISHED THIRD BACK WHEN THERE
WAS ONLY A FINAL TWO, DOMINATED
IN CHALLENGES.
ANDREW SAVAGE RIGHT NEXT DOOR
FROM THE PEARL ISLANDS, YOU WERE
IN A VERY GOOD POSITION WHEN THE
OUTCASTS PULLED YOU OUT OF THE
GAME.
A LOT PEOPLE MAY SAY YOU'RE
SIMILAR, HANDSOME, FIT, OLDER
GUYS.
THE QUESTION IS WOULD YOU CANCEL
EACH OTHER OUT AND MAYBE NEITHER
OF YOU GET ON?
TERRY, DIETZ, DID THAT DID NOT
HAPPEN FOR YOU, YOU WILL GET A
SECOND CHANCE, GET UP ON THAT
STAGE.
ANDREW SAVAGE, BEEN WAITING HOW
MANY YEARS?
 12 YEARS.
 Jeff: 12 YEARS.
YOU WILL GET A SECOND CHANCE.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
GET UP THERE.
LET'S SLIDE IN HERE.
ABBY MARIE FROM THE PHILIPPINES,

BOTH GET A SECOND CHANCE.

BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUR YOUNG,
BEAUTIFUL, SMART STRATEGISTS.

JEREMY AND SHANE, POLAR
OPPOSITES.
