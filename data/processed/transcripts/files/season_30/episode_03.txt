 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," CAROLYN FOUND THE
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: WHILE HER
WHITE-COLLAR TRIBE WAS EMBRACING
A WITH IT OF THE NO-COLLAR WAY
OF LIFE.
 I DON'T ME WHY OUR CAMP HAS
SUDDENLY BECOME THE NAKED CAMP.








WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE?
 Jeff: FOR THE BLUE-COLLAR
TRIBE, HARD WORK IS TAKING ITS
TOLL.
 WE ALL NEED TO GET UP AND DO
SOMETHING.
 THERE'S STUFF TO BE DONE OUT
HERE WHERE WE HAVE TO SURVIVE.
 Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE -- WILL IS AN ABSOLUTE
DISASTER -- WILL FELL APART.
NO COLLAR GOES TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
WITH THE NO-COLLAR TRIBE FACING








THEIR FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL, NINA
WAS STRUGGLING TO FIT IN.
 DON'T TOUCH ME.
I THOUGHT THE PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I LONG.
 Jeff: WHILE VINCE WANTED TO
RECRUIT WILL.
 IF WE GET JENN OUT...
 Jeff: BUT WILL PROMISED TO
GO WITH THE YOUNGER ALLIANCE TO
TAKE OUT NINA.
 HOPEFULLY WILL'S ON BOARD
WITH ME BECAUSE IF HE'S NOT,
HE'S GOING TO MUDDLE UP A LOT OF
PLANS.
 Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, WILL DECIDED TO GO WITH
HIS OWN AGENDA.
ALL SORRY, BROTHER, BUT YOU GOT
TO GO.
 Jeff: TAKING OUT VINCE.
VINCE, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
 LEAVING NINA ON THE BOTTOM
ALL ALONE.
 Jeff: VINCE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 I THINK VINCE SPUN A LOT OF
WEBS WITH ALL OF US.
I WANTED TO STICK WITH THE
SPLIT-VOTE PLAN, BUT WILL ENDED
UP VOTING FOR VINCE INSTEAD, AND
FRANKLY, I DON'T TRUST HIM MAYBE
AS MUCH AS I DID, AND IT JUST
MADE ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE.
I GUESS IT WORKED OUT.
 IT WAS TO THE POINT WHERE I
DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST.
TO ME WHAT HAPPENED IN TRIBAL
COUNCIL, YOU HAVE TO THINK
AHEAD.
I DIDN'T TRUST VINCE, SO I JUST
PROLONGED MY CHANCES IN THIS
GAME.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
I'M PLAYING CHESS, NOT CHECKERS.
 I KNOW I'M THE NEXT ONE OUT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO DO, SO CAN YOU MAKE IT SO I
DON'T FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER
BEFORE YOU GET RID OF ME?
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO
BLINDSIDE JENN TONIGHT, BUT WILL
BAILED.
I WENT INTO TRIBAL THINKING WE
WERE GOING TO BE A SOLID THREE.
I LEFT TRIBAL BACK TO BEING AN
OUTSIDER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHISPER BEHIND
ME BACK.
YOU CAN STAND OVER THERE AND I
CAN BE HERE AND CAN'T HEAR YOU.
 NINA.
 THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS
WIN CHALLENGES TO STAY IN THE
GAME.
 I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE
ME OUT NEXT.
I KNOW THAT.
 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONE?
 BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
VOTE EACH OTHER OUT.
 DID YOU THINK VINCE WAS GOING
TONIGHT?
 NO.
 EXACTLY.
CRAZY THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
DON'T QUIT BEFORE IT'S OVER.
 NINA IMMEDIATELY PULLS A NINA
AND STARTS CRYING AND GETS ALL
UPSET AND THEN BRINGS IN HER
HEARING THING AGAIN, TOO.
I'M LIKE, NINA, ALL YOU DO IS
TALK ABOUT YOUR HEARING.
I GET IT.
YOU'RE DEAF.
WE ALL UNDERSTAND.
STOP USING IT AS AN AN EXCUSE.
[HOWLING]
 MONKEY TEACHES WHITE COLLAR
HOW THE LIVE IN THE WILD.
BIG PAPA, BIG MAMA HOWLER
MONKEYS JUST GOT IT ON.
 WHAT?
 I JUST SO MONKEY SEX.
 REALLY?
 START TO FINISH.
 SHIRIN IS CRAZY.
SHE'S LIKE, GUYS, GUYS, THERE'S
MONKEYS, AND PRIVATE PARTS.
I'M LIKE, WHAT?
 THAT'S WHAT IT LIKES WHEN A
WOMAN WANTS A BABY.
 I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
TO GO WITH THAT.
 A LOT OF HOWLING FROM THE MEN
FOR A WHILE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WORK IN
CORPORATE AMERICA.
 NO SNUGGLING AFTERWARDS,
NOTHING.
THAT'S WHAT I JUST WITNESSED.
 SHIRIN JUST SPENT MOST OF THE
MORNING TALKING ABOUT HOWLER
MONKIES.
SHE'S ABOUT AS ANNOYING AND LOUD
AS A HOWLER MONKEY IN OUR CAMP.
 THAT HAPPENS AGAIN THREE OR
FIVE MORE TIMES.
 SHE HAS A VIBE THAT'S WEIRD
AND DOESN'T FIT IN.
SHE'S DEFINITELY TRYING TO FIT
IN AND IT SHOWS.
 THE REALITY IS IT'S ACTUALLY
PAINTING A BLACK X ON HER BACK.
 OH, MY GOD.
THIS TASTES LIKE WATER.
THAT'S THE BEST BATCH OF WATER
WE'VE EVER MADE.
 GOT TO GET SOME FOOD.
I'D LIKE A NICE FISH.
 I'D RATHER HAVE COMFORT ALL
DAY LONG.
 I'D LIKE A BLANKET.
 REALLY?
 I'VE GOTTEN LIKE FIVE HOURS
OF SLEEP SINCE WE GOT HERE.
 EVERY NIGHT.
 EVERY NIGHT IN?
NO WAY!
 HATERS BECAUSE WE TELL THE
TRUTH.
 JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THE FACTS DOESN'T CHANGE THE
FACTS.
 GO TO BED, DAN.
 I THINK MY BEST
CHARACTERISTIC MAY BE MY WORST
CHARACTERISTIC, WHICH IS MY
MOUTH.
I HAVE A VERY HARD TIME KEEPING
MY MOUTH SHUT, BUT I DEFINITELY
FEEL THAT I'M NOT AS BAD OFF AS
I WAS, AND I CAN LEARN FROM MY
MISTAKES.
SOMETIMES IT TAKES AN ANVIL TO
BE DROPPED ON MY HEAD, BUT I CAN
LEARN.
 NOBODY ASKED YOU.
 YEAH, YOUR MOTHER'S A
[BLEEPED] TOO.
 WHOA, WHOA.
 NEVER MENTION A MOTHER,
BROTHER.
 ME AND DAN WERE JOKING
AROUND.
I FORGET WHAT I SAID TO HIM, BUT
HE CAME BACK WITH YOUR MOTHER'S
A [BLEEPED].
DAN IS TRYING VERY HARD TO MAKE
US LAUGH.
HE HAS TO CHIME IN ON ALL THE
JOKES, BUT THE FACT IS, DAN,
YOU'RE NOT FUNNY, BRO.
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER.
YOU DON'T DISRESPECT MY FAMILY.
BACK HOME IF SOMEONE EVER CALLED
MY MOTHER A [BLEEPED], THEN I'M
GOING TO JUMP DOWN YOUR THROAT.
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE ON
"SURVIVOR."
 ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE SO SERIOUS.
I DID NOT THINK BLUE-COLLAR
PEOPLE WERE EMOTIONAL.
HANGING WITH THESE GUYS, THEY'RE
EMOTIONAL.
 DUDE, WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
 WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
 I'M SITTING BACK, WATCHING,
ANALYZING AND KNOWING WHEN TO
INTERJECT.
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES IF THERE'S A
BAR FIGHT, WE DON'T RUSH THERE
BECAUSE BY THE TIME WE GET
THERE, THEY DUKE IT OUT AND
THEY'RE CALM AND THEY'VE SETTLED
DOWN.
WE GET THERE, OH, YOU KNOW, YOU
GUYS WORKED IT OUT?
YEAH.
BUT RODNEY CAN BE A DRAMA QUEEN.
 DAN'S PICTURING HE'S ONE OF
MY BOYS FROM BACK HOME.
HE'S DIGGING HIMSELF A BIGGER
AND BIGGER HOLE.
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT ENDS UP IN
THE END.
HE CROSSED THE LINE BIG TIME
WITH THAT.
 LOOKS GORGEOUS OUT.
 REALLY IN
 YEAH.
 WANT THE GO SURFING?
 YEAH.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.
 HALEY AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
AT THESE WAVES SINCE WE GOT
HERE.
LOOKING AT THESE PERFECT LITTLE
BATTLES, IT'S KILLING US.
SO WAY, WHY NOT HAVE FUN WITH
IT.
IT'S DRIFT WOOD.
IT'S ROUNDED ON THE BOTTOM, FLAT
ON THE TOP.
THAT'S PERFECT.
 BODY SURFING IS SUCH A GOOD
IDEA.
SURFING IS PROBABLY MY
NUMBER-THREE PASSION IN LIFE.
SO WHEN SHE PULLED THAT OUT, I
WAS LIKE, YEAH, GIRL, I'M RIGHT
WITH YOU.
 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT NO
COLLARS DO.
I GUARANTEE YOU THE OTHER TRIBES
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING
STUFF LIKE THIS, BUT NO COLLARS
LOVE TO HAVE FUN.
NOTHING IS TOO SERIOUS OUT HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE TAKES
THIS GAME SO SERIOUSLY.
[LAUGHTER]
 WHAT DID YOU THINK?
 IT TASTES GOOD.
WITH VINCE GONE, I FEEL LIKE A
LITTLE OF THE PARANOIA HAS LEFT
THE TRIBE.
 DID YOU GET HIM?
 YEAH.
EDIBLE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
THE WAVES ARE CRASHING.
EVERYTHING IS GOLDEN.
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
I JUST WANT TO KEEP CONTINUING
TO PROVIDE FOR THE TRIBE.
I FOUND US AN AFTERNOON SNACK.
 ANOTHER LIZARD.
 KEEPING EVERYONE'S STATE OF
MIND IN A GOOD FRAME OF
REFERENCE AND BRING THAT TEAM
CAMARADERIE UP, UP, UP.
SO YOU GOOD TODAY AFTER LAST
NIGHT?
HAPPY TO BE HERE?
 HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT
WANTED BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON THE OUT, BUT
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
 OKAY.
 NINA, I LOVE HER, BUT I THINK
SHE JUST FELT LIKE SHE WAS ALONE
AGAIN, SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO
BECOME A LITTLE BETTER FRIENDS
WITH HER.
JUST KEEP PLAYING, OKAY?
MY MOM WAS AN INTERPRETER FOR
THE DEAF.
SHE TAUGHT ME AND MY THREE
SISTERS SIGN LANGUAGE, SO I'VE
BEEN AROUND THE DEAF COMMUNITY A
LOT IN MY LIFE.
IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE
THINGS YOU KEEP IN YOUR POCKET.
 IT'S REALLY TOUGH.
 IT IS TOUGH.
I'M NOT USED TO... NO ONE'S USED
TO THIS.
I WANT YOU TO PLAY.
LIKE I WANT YOU TO ENJOY IT AND
HAVE FUN WITH US.
 JOE AND I HAD A NICE
CONVERSATION.
HE REALLY WANTED TO TELL ME TO
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FUN.
 JUST KEEP PLAYING, OKAY?
 BEFORE I LOST MY HEARING, I
WAS IN SALES.
I'VE BEEN WHITE COLLAR BEFORE,
BUT I'M NOT NOW.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO BACK.
 ONCE I LOST MY HEARING, A
TRADITIONAL JOB WAS NOT
IMPORTANT TO ME, SO I REALLY AM
A NO-COLLAR PERSON, BUT THESE
PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE
FREE SPIRITED THAN ME.
 ARE YOU GOING TO TRY THE
LIZARD, NINA?
ONE LITTLE TASTE FOR ME.
DO IT.
 SO I'M FINDING OUT THAT I DO
HAVE LIMITATIONS.
 HELP YOURSELF.
 I GOT TO CHANGE OR I'M GOING
TO END UP GOING HOME.
 IT'S PRETTY GOODMENT I'M
TELLING YOU, MAN.
IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE LIZARD.
IT TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.
 COME ON, NINA.
DO IT FOR "SURVIVOR."
 I'M LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S
OUT OF PLACE.
 IT'S GOT TO BE DOWN HERE.
 THE WHOLE TRIBE IS OUT
LOOKING FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
SO I'M WATCHING THE FIRE,
RELAXING, KIND OF ENJOYING IT
BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL SO I DON'T
REALLY HAVE TO SEARCH.
FUN.
 WE HAVE TO WIN THE NEXT
CHALLENGE.
 WHAT'S THAT?
 WHAT IF WE SAY WE ALL MAKE A
TRUCE TO NOT LOOK FOR IT UNTIL
WE WIN THE NEXT CHALLENGE AND
HAVE ANOTHER CLUE.
 SEEING YOU'RE THE ONE WHO IS
LOOKING MORE THAN ANYONE.
 I HAVEN'T TRUSTED YOU SINCE
DAY ONE.
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF LOOKING FOR
IT, GO TAKE A SEAT.
 YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME SINCE DAY
ONE?
 YEAH.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A
PARANOID, PANICKING WOMAN SINCE
DAY ONE WHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE.
 I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
WHAT DID I SAY?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 SHIRIN IS LIKE A
BLOOD-SUCKING LEECH THAT JUST
WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE AND SHE'S
THE MOST ANNOYING PERSON I'VE
EVER MET IN MY LIFE.
SHE'S LIKE THE MOSQUITOES AT
NIGHT.
THEY'RE BECAUSING IN YOUR EAR
AND YOUR EAR AND YOUR EAR, AND
YOU'RE JUST LIKE, GOD.
 WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING TO ME?
 BECAUSE I'M BUSY SEARCHING
FOR SOMETHING, LIKE YOU SHOULD
BE.
 I SHOULD BE?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
 JOAQUIN WAS NOT HIMSELF.
THERE WAS A FURY BEHIND WHAT HE
WAS SAYING.
IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE PRETTY
GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW THE MANEUVER IN THIS
GAME.
 WHAT'S THE DEAL?
WHY CAN'T WE GO BACK?
 YOU CAN GO BACK.
I'M ON THE OUTS RIGHT NOW.
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IS BEST
FOR ME IN THE LONG RUN.
ME AND TYLER HAVE A GOOD
RAPPORT.
I SHOWED HIM THE CLUE.
HE'S MY BOY.
HE NEEDS TO SEE IT.
 NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE YOU
CLENCH YOUR THIRD BASE, SATIATE
YOUR NEED FOR POWER.
 ON DAY TWO CAROLYN SHOWED ME
THE IDOL, BUT JOAQ SHOWED ME THE
CLUE.
I APPRECIATE YOU GOING THE EXTRA
MILE TO SHOW ME.
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SHOW SOMEBODY
AND GO THAT EXTRA MILE, THERE'S
KIND OF A UNITY THAT COMES WITH
IT.
 THEY'RE BACK.
 EVEN THOUGH JOAQUIN IS ON THE
OUTS, RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY
GETTING ALONG WITH HIM, AND
SHIRIN'S AT THE POINT NOW WHERE
CRAZY IS AS CRAZY DOES.
FROM THE NUDITY TO THE TALKING
TO THE MONKEYS IN THE TREES TO
THE INCESSANT TALKING AROUND
CAMP, I HAVE A STRONG FEELING
THAT IF WE'RE TO LOSE THIS NEXT
CHALLENGE, SHIRIN WOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY AT THE TOP OF
EVERYONE'S LIST.
 THE MAN THAT I CALL DAD IS
THE PASTOR OF MY CHURCH, AND HE
TAUGHT ME AT A VERY EARLY AGE
THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WORK
HARD, GOOD THINGS WILL COME TO
YOU.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME TO
DO SOMETHING BECAUSE I SEE THAT
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I
JUST DO IT.
BUT THIS BLUE-COLLAR TRIBE,
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE
BEST WORK ETHIC OUT OF ALL THREE
TRIBES, IS FAILING IN WORK
ETHIC, AND I FEEL LIKE RODNEY IS
THE WORST.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I
MEAN.
 IT HAS TO BE DONE.
 MIKE MAKES HIS COMMENTS AND
I'M LIKE, OKAY, THIS IS
ANNOYING.
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE BUSTING
YOUR ASS.
WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF ALL
MORNING WITH NO THANK YOU.
BLUE -COLLAR PEOPLE IN GENERAL
TEND TO CRITIQUE OTHER PEOPLE'S
WORK ETHIC BECAUSE WE THINK OURS
IS THE BEST, WE THINK WE KNOW
THE BEST WAY, WE THINK WE WORK
HARDER.
AND SOMETIMES IT'S A DIFFERENCE
OF ONE LESS STICK IN SOMEONE'S
HAND, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I KNOW IN THIS TRIBE I HAVE THE
BEST WORK ETHIC.
 EVERYBODY'S GOT TO PITCH IN.
 YEAH, I KNOW, BUT NOT WHEN
MIKE WANTS IT DONE.
NOT WHEN MIKE WANTS IT DONE,
BRO.
WE'LL GET IT DONE WHEN WE GET IT
DONE.
 I'M GOING TO BE FIRST ONE TO
GO HOME BECAUSE I STEP UP AND
SAY SOMETHING, THEN I'LL STEP UP
AND SAY SOMETHING.
 IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE TO DO
WORK ALL DAY EVERY DAY.
NOT EVERY DAY WE NEED TO BE ON A
MISSION LIKE YOU AT 8:00 IN THE
MORNING.
WE CAN GET IT DONE DURING THE
DAY, BRO.
YOU NEED RELAX AND LET PEOPLE DO
IT AT THEIR OWN PACE.
ARE YOU THE CAPTAIN OF THIS
TEAM?
RELAX THEN.
RELAX.
I'LL GET SOME FIREWOOD WHEN I
WANT TO GET FIREWOOD.
YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER SO SIT THE
[BLEEPED] DOWN.
WHETHER I GET FIREWOOD IN TEN
MINUTES, 20 MINUTES OR AN HOUR,
I'LL GET IT, BUT DON'T TELL ME
TO DO IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE OR
I'M NOT DOING IT.
 EVERYONE ELSE HERE IS KEEPING
YOUR MOUTH SHUT, BUT EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS SAYING THE
EXACT SAME THING I'M SAYING.
 LOOK AT ME RIGHT NOW.
I'M SHAKING.
LET ME EAT MY FOOD AND THEN I'LL
GO DO THIS WITH YOU.
ALL I'M SAYING IS LET ME GET
FOOD IN ME, WHEN I HAVE MY
ENERGY, I'LL DO IT.
I'M JACKED FOR A REASON.
I'VE GOT MOTIVATION AND
DEDICATION.
I'LL DO IT.
LET ME DO IT WHEN I'M READY, NOT
WHEN MIKE'S READY.
 RODNEY'S GOING TO DO WHAT
RODNEY WANTS TO DO.
WHETHER YOU DO THE MOST OR THE
ELECTION IT'S NOT GOING TO GET
YOU TO THE END.
IT'S KEEPING EVERYBODY HAPPY.
GET OFF MY BACK.
 MAN, SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WEREN'T
FEELING GOOD.
 NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.
THAT'S WHY I WORK FOR MYSELF.
 I HEAR YOU.
 I'LL DO STUFF WHEN I WANT TO
DO IT, ON RODNEY'S TIME.
THIS AIN'T AN OIL RIG.
WE GOT TO WORK HARD.
YOU HAVE TO WORK EXTREMELY HARD.
IF YOU DON'T WORK THIS DAMN
HARD, YOU'LL GET BOOTED OFF.
I'M NOT A HICK.
I CAN'T GROW UP IN THIS
ENVIRONMENT.
I DON'T LIVE THIS KIND OF LIFE.
MAYBE HE DOES IN HIS $100,000
RANCH HE OWNS.
HOUSES IN MASS COST $400,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE
THERE.
ABOUT IT NOBODY WANT TO LIVE IN
TEXAS.
 MIKE'S THE NUMBER-ONE TIGER,
SO I HAVE TO LAY LOW, GO BACK ON
MY THREE Cs, MY COOL, CALM AND
COLLECTIVE.
 I'M GOING TO STACK A PILE OF
FIREWOOD.
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYONE
ASK ME TO GET NO MORE FIREWOOD.
 A LOT OF THIS STARTED A LOT
YESTERDAY FOR ME.
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE I'M BUSTING
MY ASS.
 SO ARE WE.
 I CAN FINISH?
I LET YOU GUYS FINISH.
I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH.
I DON'T FEEL THAT THE RESPECT
THAT I'M GIVING YOU GUYS IS
BEING RECIPROCATED BACK TO ME.
 IF ANYONE GETS RESPECT AROUND
HERE, IT'S YOU.
FOR SURE IT'S NOT US.
 WHEN DID I NOT RESPECT YOU
GUYS?
 WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAID
THANK YOU FOR ANYTHING THAT GOT
DONE BY US?
 EVERY SINGLE DAY.
 WHEN?
 EVERY SINGLE DAY?
 NAME ONE.
NAME ONE.
WE DID THIS ALL MORNING AND YOU
CAME BACK AND BITCHED.
I DIDN'T GET TEN CENTS IN.
THANKS FOR DOING MILAN DRY.
 WHEN DID YOU SAY THANK YOU
FOR GETTING FIREWOOD.
ER TIME AND EVERY TIME THAT
WE'VE GOTTEN FIREWOOD, WE'VE
BEEN THERE.
EVERY [BLEEPED] TIME.
EVERY TIME WE'VE GOTTEN
FIREWOOD, WE'VE HELPED.
 MIKE IS BIG IGNORANT RIGHT
NOW, IT'S THE ONE THING THAT I
CANNOT TAKE.
OF COURSE, HE WANTS TO SIT THERE
AND FIGHT WITH ME OF ALL PEOPLE.
LIKE I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME BIBLE
VERSE ON YOUR BACK, BUT THAT
DIDN'T HELP THE FIRE GET TENDED
TO.
WE ALL DO EVERYTHING.
I GENUINELY FEEL LIKE THAT.
WE DON'T GET FIREWOOD?
TRUE OR FALSE?
 YEAH, YOU GET FIREWOOD.
 WE DON'T COOK, TRUE OR FALSE?
 YOU COOK ALL THE TIME.
 TEND TO THE FIRE?
GO GET WATER?
WE DON'T TEND TO THE FIRE?
HOW THE [BLEEPED] DO YOU THINK
THIS FIRE IS GOING RIGHT NOW?
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT GOT THERE?
MAGIC?
DID YOUR GOD COME DOWN AND DO IT
WITH HIS BEARD?
 I'M NOT SITTING HERE SAYING
I'M THE BEST CHRISTIAN IN THE
WORLD, BUT I DO HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, AND THAT
WAS VERY OFFENSIVE TO ME.
HONESTLY, IT HURT MY FEELINGS ON
A PERSONAL LEVEL.
LIKE I SAID, IF I'M STEPPING UP
AND SAYING SOMETHING MEANS I'M
FIRST TO GO, SEND ME HOME.
 MIKE ALWAYS SAYS, AND IF
THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS WANT TO SEND
ME HOME, THEN SEND ME HOME.
WISH COME TRUE.
SORRY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
WHITE COLLARS, BLUE-COLLAR TRIBE
GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE
NEW NO-COLLAR TRIBE.
VINCE VOTED OUT IN THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 HELL, YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST, I
WILL TAKE BACK THE IDOLS.
GIVE IT UP, SHIRIN.
LY TAKE -- I WILL TAKE IT.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BECOME UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, EACH
TRIBE WILL CARRY A LARGE BUCKET
TO A WATER TOWER WHERE YOU WILL
FILL IT.
YOU'LL THEN RACE BACK, WORKING
TOGETHER TO PLUG AS MANY OF THE
HOLES AS YOU CAN TO KEEP THE
WATER FROM LEAKING OUT.
YOU'LL EMPTY WHAT'S LEFT INTO A
BARREL AND HEAD BACK OUT.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FILL THEIR
BARREL AND RAISE THEIR FLAG WINS
IMMUNITY AND REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE
FIRST TRIBE TO FINISH, A MASSIVE
COMFORT REWARD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 YEAH.
CHAIRS.
 Jeff: CHAIRS, BLANKETS,
PILLOW, CANDLE, ROPE AND A TARP.
IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU ARE
LIVING AT CAMP.
SECOND TRIBE TO FINISH, NOT AS
BIG, BUT STILL VERY USEFUL, A
TARP.
LAST TRIBE TO FINISH, NOTHING
BUT A DATE WITH ME AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE THIRD PERSON VOLTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
BLUE COLLAR YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
PERSON.
GOT TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT.
IT CAN BE ANYBODY YOU WANT.
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?
LINDSEY GOING TO SIT THIS ONE
OUT.
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
WHITE COLLAR FLYING OVER AND
TOSSING THEIR BUCKET.
WILL STRUGGLING EARLY.
NO COLLARS TAKING A LITTLE
LONGER OUT OF THE GATE.
VERY SIMPLE PREMISE: FILL YOUR
BUCKET WITH WATER AND TRY TO GET
BACK AS MUCH OF THAT WATER AS
YOU CAN BEFORE IT LEAKS OUT.
 YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR HANDS
DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT COVERING THE HOLE.
RIGHT THERE.
 LIKE THAT?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: JOE IS GOING TO SEND
NINA OUT AHEAD.
COULD BE A VERY SMART STRATEGY
BY THE NO COLLARS IF IT PLAYS
OFF.
BLUE COLLARS COMING BACK.
 THAT'S IT, YOU GUYS.
BRING IT DOWN, QUICK, QUICK,
QUICK!
 Jeff: HERE COMES WHITE
COLLAR.
NO COLLAR HEADING BACK.
THE GOAL IS TEAMWORK.
THE MORE HOLES YOU PLUG, THE
MORE WATER YOU WILL HAVE TO DUMP
INTO YOUR BARREL, WHICH MEANS
THE FEWER RUNS YOU WILL HAVE TO
MAKE.
WHITE COLLAR HAS THEIR FIRST
BUCKET.
NO COLLAR MOVING VERY SLOW, BUT
THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING IF
THEY'RE PLUGGING THE HOLES.
 MAKE SURE WE GET IT ALL IN.
 Jeff: NO COLLAR DUMPS HALF
THEIR WATER ON THE GROUND.
HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR.
ONCE AGAIN NINA GOING OUT.
DO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE REASON
WHY NINA IS NOT PART OF THIS.
NO COLLAR ONCE AGAIN VERY SLOW
AND DOING IT WITH ONLY FOUR
TRIBE MEMBERS, EVEN THOUGH THEY
HAVE FIVE.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS NOT
WORKING, NO COLLARS.
BLUE COLLAR BACK WITH ANOTHER
BUCKET FULL OF WATER.
WHITE COLLAR BACK WITH ANOTHER
BUCKET.
HEADING BACK OUT.
FOR SOME REASON THAT MAKES SENSE
NO COMERS TO HAVE NINA NOT
PARTICIPATE.
HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR AGAIN.
 YEAH!
 Jeff: HERE COMES WHITE
COLLAR.
WILL IS EXHAUSTED.
IT IS WHITE COLLAR AND BLUE
COLLAR, JUST LIKE THE LAST
CHALLENGE, DUKING IT OUT FOR THE
FIRST AND SECOND.
 QUICKLY!
QUICKLY!
YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM.
YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM!
 Jeff: THIS COULD BE IT.
 GET IT IN.
 Jeff: COULD THIS BE ENOUGH?
NO.
WHITE COLLAR HAS TO HEAD BACK
OUT.
NOT ENOUGH FOR BLUE COLLAR.
THEY HAVE TO HEAD BACK OUT.
IT IS VERY CLOSE BETWEEN BLUE
AND WHITE.
 THIS IS IT, YOU GUYS!
THIS IS IT.
 Jeff: EVERY BIT OF WATER
YOU KEEP IN THAT BUCKET MAKES A
DIFFERENCE.
NINA FINALLY HELPING OUT NOW FOR
THE FIRST TIME.
 A LITTLE FURTHER.
 GO, GO.
 GO.

 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR HEADING
BACK.
THIS COULD BE IT.
WHITE COLLAR HEADING BACK.
THIS COULD BE IT FOR THEM.
HOW MUCH WATER CAN THEY KEEP IN
THE BUCKET?
NO COLLAR WITH ANOTHER BUCKET.
NICE BUT NOT ENOUGH.
NO COLLAR HEADING BACK OUT.
HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR.
COULD THIS BE FOR THE WIN?
HERE COMES WHITE COLLAR.
 GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: YES!
BLUE COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD!
WHITE COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD, SEND NOTHING COLLAR BACK
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
-- SENDING NO COLLAR BACK THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
BLUE COLLAR, NICE FINISH.
ONCE AGAIN NO TRIBAL COUNCIL,
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THE BLUE
COLLAR TRIBE.
WHITE COLLAR, ONCE AGAIN A NICE
FINISH.
THIS TRIBE STAYING INTACT.
BLUE COLLAR, COME GET YOUR
MASSIVE REWARD AND HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 APPRECIATE IT, JEFF.
 OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR, NO
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
COME GET YOUR TARP, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
NO-COLLAR TRIBE, FOR THE SECOND
TIME IN A ROW A LOSS, BUT THIS
TIME IT SEEMED TO CENTER AROUND
STRATEGY.
JOE, WHAT WAS THE THINKING IN
HAVING NINA NOT PARTICIPATE IN
PLUGGING HOLES?
 WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D BE A
LITTLE QUICKER WITH PUTTING NINA
AT THE END OF THE OBSTACLES, SHE
WOULD PLUG THE HOLES ONCE WE GOT
THROUGH THEM.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BAD CALL
LOOKING AT IT NOW, BUT IT SEEMED
LIKE THE BEST THING TO DO IN THE
MOMENT.
 Jeff: NO COLLARS, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 I THOUGHT WE WAS AT DAMN BOOT
CAMP.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
THE CHALLENGE KICKED MY ASS
TODAY.
IT REALLY DID.
IT KICKED MY ASS.
THE SAD FACT IS WE'RE GOING TO
ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I
THINK IT'S TIME FOR NINA TO GO.
 I JUST WANT TO SAY SORRY.
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
TODAY, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING.
I ESPECIALLY... I FEEL SO
TERRIBLE.
 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU MADE THAT
CALL BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT I
COULDN'T DO IT.
I COULD HAVE TOTALLY...
 I AM SO SORRY.
I MEAN IT.
I'M GENUINELY SO SORRY BECAUSE I
NEVER EVER SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT
CALL.
MAN, WE WERE SO CLOSE TODAY, AND
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I KIND OF
CAME UP WITH THE STRATEGY AND
THE GAME PLAN, AND I SHOULD HAVE
JUST SHUT UP AND LET NINA
PARTICIPATE, AND I FEEL PRETTY
BAD ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE I SCREWED HER OVER
TODAY.
AND I KNOW NINA DOESN'T WANT TO
TWO HOME.
NO ONE WANTS TO GO HOME FROM
THIS GAME, SO SHE WANTS THE
FIGHT, SHE'LL FIGHT.
 WELL, I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO MY GUT.
YOU WANT ME TO STAY AND HELP
PLUG HOLES.
YOU'RE LIKE, NO, GO.
I THOUGHT, MAN, I SHOULD JUST
SAY AND HELP PLUG THOSE HOLES.
 ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I'M SO SORRY.
I JUST FEEL BAD FOR ASSUMING
THAT SHE WOULD SLOW US DOWN.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
 LIVE AND LEARN.
 WE BLEW IT AGAIN.
WE TRIED TO MAKE NINA A
NON-FACTOR, AND IT COST US.
SO BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WE GO.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, MAN.
THIS IS THE GAME, DOG.
WHAT ARE WE PLAYING?
WHAT ARE WE PLAYING?
 "SURVIVOR."
 ARE WE PLAYING FRIENDS?
 NO, BUT I DON'T LIKE THE
LOSE.
 I DON'T LIKE THE LOSE EITHER.
WE MADE A DECISION AS A TEAM.
SHE'S BEEN DEAD WEIGHT FOR A
WHILE.
OKAY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HOW DO YOU THINK THE VOTE IS
GOING TO GO TONIGHT?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
 WHAT'S THAT?
 I SAID, I HAVE NO IDEA.
 I THINK TONIGHT'S DEFINITELY
BETWEEN ME AND WILL, BECAUSE THE
THREE THAT ARE IN CONTROL RIGHT
NOW ARE JOE, JENN AND HALI, SO I
NEED TO CONVINCE THEM TO VOTE
WILL OVER ME.
 DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO
YOU WANT TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT?
 ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE WILL?
 I COULD VOTE WILL.
 THAT'S TWO CHALLENGES IN A
ROW HE SUCKEDMENT ONE CHALLENGE
DOESN'T MAKE ME GO NO, BUT TWO
IT DOES.
 NINA AND WILL ARE DEFINITELY
ON BORROWED TIME.
WILL DID NOT PERFORM IN THE
CHALLENGE.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
BUT I STILL DON'T REALLY TRUST
HIM AT ALL.
HE SEEMS SNEAKY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
NINA, SHE'S A WET BLANKET ON THE
ENTIRE TRIBE.
I THINK WILL AND NINA SUCK
EQUALLY IN CHALLENGES.
 I DO, TOO.
WILL SUCKS.
 WELL, IT TOOK LONGER FOR WILL
TO SWIM TO THE BOAT THE OTHER
DAY THAN NINA.
 YEAH, IT DID.
I THOUGHT WILL WAS DYING.
 NINA IS JUST SO FRAIL AND HER
ATTITUDE IS NOT THERE, BUT WILL
IS STRUGGLING LIKE HARD CORE.
 WHAT IF ME AND YOU VOTE WILL?
WILL VOTED FOR THE WRONG PERSON
LAST TRIBAL.
AND NOW, YOU KNOW, I DON'T TRUST
HIM.
I THINK HE'S A SNAKE.
SO MY BIGGEST FEAR MOVING
FORWARD IS THAT WILL MIGHT DO
SOMETHING IDIOTIC AND THAT JENN
AND I WILL HAVE TROUBLE AT THE
MERGE.
SO WE'RE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A
HARD PLACE RIGHT NOW, WHO IS
GOING TO GO HOME, WILL IT BE
WILL OR NINA?
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IT SEEMED TO CENTER AROUND
TRUST, AND IT RESULTED IN WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A BLIND SIDE ON
VINCE, BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM AS
THOUGH VINCE WAS THE ONLY ONE
SURPRISED BY THE OUTCOME.
WILL, WHEN YOU GUYS GOT BACK TO
CAMP, WAS THERE SOMETHING TO
CLEAR UP?
 YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
I HAD TO GO WITH SOMEBODY I
TRUSTED, AND THAT'S WHY I VOTED
HIM OUT.
 Jeff: JOE, IT'S INTERESTING
THAT THIS GAME PLAYS ON SO MANY
LEVELS, BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN
THE TRIBE PORTION OF THE GAME,
AND YET YOU'RE ALREADY PLAYING
THE INDIVIDUAL PART OF THE GAME.
AND THE TRUST ISSUES COULD COME
BACK IF YOUR TRIBE REMAINS
INTACT.
 OH, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE
OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU MAKE
MISTAKES TO FIX THOSE MISTAKES,
SO, YEAH, IT'S A HUGE FACTOR TO
TRUST PEOPLE AND TRY TO KEEP
YOUR ALLIANCES AS STRONG AS
POSSIBLE GOING INTO THE FUTURE.
 Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
YOUR STRATEGY TO PULL NINA OUT
OF THIS CHALLENGE WAS HARD TO
UNDERSTAND.
JOE, WHAT WAS THE THINKING?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, FIVE PEOPLE
GOING THROUGH THAT LADDER WAS A
LITTLE TRICKY, SO I WAS THINKING
THAT NINA COULD STUMBLE AND FALL
AND TAKE THE WHOLE THING DOWN,
SO, YEAH, I KIND OF MESSED UP
TODAY BIG TIME.
 Jeff: AND YET, NINA, WHAT
YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS THEY DIDN'T
HAVE ENOUGH FAITH IN YOU TO LET
YOU PLAY.
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS,
AND IT REALLY SHOWED ME THAT
BECAUSE OF MY DISADVANTAGE, THEY
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FAITH THAT I
CAN DO ANYTHING.
 Jeff: BUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HEARING.
 I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY LOOK AT
ME AS A WHOLE PERSON THAT HAS A
DISADVANTAGE, WHETHER IT'S MY
EARS, MY FEET OR WHATEVER IT IS.
 Jeff: BECAUSE YOU'RE DEAF?
 YES.

 I'LL DISAGREE WITH THAT.
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE PULL
NINA TO THE SIDE TO GIVE HER A
PEP TALK, BOOST HER MORALE, IT
ALWAYS GOES BACK TO HER BEING
DEAF, SO THAT'S WHAT IS MAKING
ME UPSET BECAUSE WE TRY.
 Jeff: JOE, THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON
"SURVIVOR" WHERE PERCEPTION
BECOMES REALITY, NO MATTER WHAT
THE PERCEPTION THE GROUP HAS, IT
IS REAL, AND IT IS TRUE FOR
THEM.
 YEAH.
SHE'S KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING
US JUST AS MUCH AS SHE FEELS
MISUNDERSTOOD.
I MEAN, I KNOW A LOT OF DEAF
PEOPLE, AND I WOULD BE THE LAST
PERSON OF THE JUDGE YOU OR
ANYONE FOR A DISABILITY.
 Jeff: WILL, I SAW YOU TODAY
AFTER THE CHALLENGE, AND YOU
WERE WINDED.
DO YOU HAVE A REASON TO BE
CONCERNED?
 I DID STRUGGLE IN THE SECOND
CHALLENGE WITH THE BUOY.
I WENT BACK AND SAID, THAT'S ON
ME GUYS.
I THINK TODAY WE JUST AS A TEAM
JUST DIDN'T WORK.
BUT THEY KNOW WHAT I BRING TO
THE TRIBE, AND I'M JUST GOING TO
HOLD ON TO THAT.
 YOU GUYS WOULD BE CRAZY TO
KEEP WILL.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN TRUST
ME, I'M STRONG.
I CAN WIN CHALLENGES.
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN ME A
CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT I'VE GOT.
 BUT YOU'VE BEEN EMOTIONALLY
WEAK HERE A LOT AND THAT
CONCERNS ME A BIT.
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU OUT
HERE, BUT IT'S HARD FOR
EVERYONE.
WE'RE ALL GOING THROUGH PERSONAL
STRUGGLES, YOU KNOW?
 Jeff: RIGHT ON CUE.
[THUNDERING]
HALI, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT NINA
IS ON THE WRONG TRIBE.
MAYBE SHE'S NOT A NO COLLAR.
 I WONDER THAT, THAT
PHILOSOPHY YOU TAKE LIFE AS IT
COME, YOU KNOW HOW TO RIDE THE
HIGHS AND RIDE OUT THE LOWS, FOR
MOST OF OUR TRIBE LIFE, WE GO
WITH THE FLOW, BUT NINA DOESN'T
HAVE THAT SAME FLOW GOING.
 Jeff: AND YET NINA, I KNOW
YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A NO COLLAR,
A PERSON WHO IS MALLEABLE AND
DOES TRY TO LOOK AT THE WORLD
FROM DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS.
 WELL, BEFORE LOSING MY
HEARING, I HAD A LOT OF JOBS
WHERE, YOU KNOW, I MANAGED
PEOPLE.
I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOTS OF
MONEY.
I DID A LOT OF BUDGET PLANNING,
AND THAT WAS 44 YEARS OF MY
LIFE.
IT'S ONLY BEEN SEVEN YEARS THAT
I SHIFTED A LITTLE, BUT I STILL
HAVE THE WHITE-COLLAR MENTALITY.
 YOU KNOW, IN REAL LIFE YOU
MAY NEVER HAVE TO BE THE TYPE OF
PERSON THAT WOULD GO OUT AND EAT
A LIZARD.
YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO BE A NO
COLLAR PERSON BACK HOME, BUT IF
YOU WANT TO STAY IN THIS GAME
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THIS
TRIBE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE
MORE NO COLLAR IF YOU WANT TO
FIT IN.
I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING.
LIKE I DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA TO
CHANGE YOU AS A HUMAN BEING, BUT
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME,
YOU GOT TO BE A PLAYER.
 YOU KNOW, I'M LISTENING TO
WHAT THEY SAID.
IT'S A TOUGH THING, BUT I'M
TAKING IT TO HEART, AND I REALLY
THINK I CAN DO WHAT YOU'VE
SUGGESTED.
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE
NO-COLLAR TRIBE.
 Jeff: INTERESTING TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
HOPEFULLY A LITTLE BIT
CATHARTIC.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
NINA, YOU'RE UP.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, NINA.
WILL.
ONE VOTE NINA, ONE VOTE WILL.
WILL.
TWO VOTES WILL.
ONE VOTE NINA.
NINA.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES NINA, TWO VOTES WILL,
ONE VOTE LEFT.
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT, NINA.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
NINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
WELL, "SURVIVOR" IS OFTEN ABOUT
ENDURING SHORT-TERM LOSSES FOR
LONG-TERM GAINS.
LOSING TODAY'S CHALLENGE MEANS
YOU GO BACK TO CAMP WITHOUT A
TARP TO KEEP YOU DRY FROM THE
RAIN AND DOWN YET ANOTHER TRIBE
MEMBER.
THE HOPE IS IN THE LONG RUN IT
WILL BE WORTH IT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON A
SPECIAL TWO-HOUR "SURVIVOR"...
 THAT MEN MENTALITY, IS THAT
HOW YOUR MOM RAISED YOU?
 WHO THE HELL GETS A UTAH TO
ON YOUR FACE UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS.
 Jeff: THERE'S A LITTLE
BLOOD.
OH, MASSIVE COLLISION.
 SHE'S BLEEDING.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY STOP!
 ACCORDING TO THEM I'M IN THE
AS FREE SPIRITED AS THEY ARE.
MAYBE I'M NOT.
MAYBE BEING OUT HERE IN THE
ELEMENTS AND BEING WITH
COMPLETE, TOTAL STRANGERS
BROUGHT OUT A DIFFERENT SIDE OF
ME, SO, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING THE
REALLY DIG DEEP IN MYSELF AND
MAYBE MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THAT
WAY.
IT WAS DEFINITELY A
LIFE-ALTERING EIGHT DAYS.
