         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 WE CAN GET HIM OUT RIGHT NOW
AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW.
 Jeff: MIKE KNEW HE WAS IN
TROUBLE.
 I KNOW THEY ARE COMING FOR MY
HEAD.
 Jeff: AND TRIED TO BUY AN
ADVANTAGE AT THE AUCTION.
 Jeff: YOU'RE LOOKING FOR








WHITE.
 BUT DAN WAS THE LUCKY ONE.
 Jeff: YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF
AN EXTRA VOTE.
 I GET A SECOND VOTE?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS
MEANS TO ME?
 Jeff: BACK AT CAMP...
 GREAT JOB TO FLIP ON RODNEY.
 MIKE HAD NO INTENTION OF
GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
 YOU GOT TO RELAX, BRO.
WHAT MIKE WAS SAYING WAS TRUE,
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DONE, YOU








JUST MADE YOURSELF NEXT ONE OUT.
 Jeff: WITH THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL ALREADY IN HIS
POCKET, MIKE WON INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
MIKE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL...
 THOSE FOUR, THEY DON'T HAVE
YOUR BACK, DAN.
THEY ARE USING YOU.
 Jeff: MIKE TRIED TO WARN
DAN AND SIERRA ABOUT BEING ON
THE BOTTOM.
 I WANT TO GO TO THE FINAL
THREE WITH YOU.
 NOBODY EVEN LIKES YOU.
 Jeff: WHILE MILL MADE
THINGS PERSONAL WITH SHIRIN.
 I GUARANTEE THERE'S NOBODY AT
HOME RIGHT NOW MISSING YOU.
 ARE YOU REALLY SPEAKING TO ME
THAT WAY?
 YEAH, I AM SPEAKING TO YOU
THAT WAY.
 AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, SHIRIN
OPENED UP ABOUT HER FAST.
 I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY BECAUSE
MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER WAS JUST
LIKE YOU, VERBALLY ASSAULTING ME
ALL THE TIME.
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ME
PERSONALLY.
IT WENT WAY BEYOND THE GAME.
 Jeff: TENTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
BUT JENN WAS VOTED OUT.
JENN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
EIGHT ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 SHE WANTED TO TURN US.
 HARD.
 WHEN MIKE BLEW UP, HE LOST
EVERYBODY'S TRUST.
 YOU ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR HIM.
 I DO, BUT IT'S ABOUT TRUST.
HE'S SO PASSIONATE.
SO COMPLETELY.
HE CAN SAY SIERRA AND I ARE AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.
DOES IT MAKE IT TRUE?
NO.
I DO IN THE BELIEVE I AM AT THE
BOTTOM OF MY ALLIANCE.
I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE I'M PLAYING
A PASSIVE GAME.
IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE
SCHEMING BREWING.
 YOU OKAY?
THAT ASSAULT, HE VERBALLY
ASSAULTED ME AND PERSONALLY
ATTACKED ME, AND HE USED MY
PERSONAL HISTORY AGAINST ME.
 I'M NOT ONE TO CRY A LOT IN
REAL LIFE, BUT I HAVE THIS
PAVLOV'S DOG REACTION TO MEN
YELLING AT ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
THROUGH HIS BRAIN THAT HE
DOESN'T REALIZE HE PERSONALLY
ATTACKED ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
ARE YOU TRULY JUST THAT DUMB OR
THAT CRUEL?
I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY THAT
STUPID.
THE MOST HORRIFYING PARTED ABOUT
THIS FOR ME IS THAT ALL OF THIS
DRAMA MAKES WILL AN EXCELLENT
PERSON TO TAKE TO THE END, AND
YET MIKE AND I ARE ON THE
BOTTOM.
 I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL.
I REALLY AM.
 WHAT PART OF IT?
 THE PART WHERE YOU HAD TEARS
IN YOUR EYES.
I HAD NO IDEA.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT CAPE UP WAS A
BLOWOUT BETWEEN SHIRIN AND WILL.
APPARENTLY THERE'S VIOLENCE IN
HER HISTORY.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, I FEEL VERY
BAD FOR HER.
HOWEVER, THAT BEING SAID, SHIRIN
IS A DRAMA QUEEN.
SHE'S A TWO-FACED LIAR.
SHE LOVES TO PLAY THE VICTIM.
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.
I MEAN THAT.
FOR SHIRIN TO SAY THAT WILL IS
WORSE THAN HER, THAT'S
HYPOCRITICAL.
DID HE GO OVERBOARD?
FROM WHAT I HEARD, YES, HE DID,
BUT WHEN SHE'S CALLING HIM
NAMES, WHEN SHE HAS NO GRATITUDE
OR APPRECIATION, I CALL THAT
KARMA.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'LL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS
OF FOUR, USING FOUR BARREL, TWO
PLANKS AND A PIECE OF ROPE, YOU
MUST TRANSPORT ALL FOUR TRIBE
MEMBERS ACROSS THREE SECTIONS
FROM ONE END OF THE FIELD TO THE
OTHER.
IF SOMEBODY FALLS OFF OR IF A
PLANK TOUCHES THE GROUND, YOU
GOT TO GO BACK TO THE START OF
THE SECTION YOU'RE IN.
FIRST FOUR TO GET TO THE OTHER
SIDE WIN REWARD.
WHAN TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO A
BEAUTIFUL CATAMARAN FOR AN
AFTERNOON OF SAILING ALONG THE
NICARAGUAN COAST WHERE YOU WILL
ENJOY BURGERS.
 OH!
 BURGERS.
 Jeff: WITH CHEESE AND
BACON.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: AND FOR DESSERT, PIE.
 OH.
 NICE.
 Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DO A SCHOOLYARD PICK.
YOU WILL DECIDE THE TEAMS.
DO IT.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
RUNNING FOR BLUE IT IS MIKE,
SHIRIN, SIERRA AND RODNEY.
RUNNING FOR RED, IT IS TYLER,
DAN, CAROLYN AND WILL.
HERE WE GO FOR A NICE REWARD.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
PRETTY SIMPLE.
FOUR BARREL, TWO PLANKS AND
ROPE.
QUESTION IS, HOW TO MOST
EFFECTIVELY USE THESE ITEMS TO
TRANSPORT FOUR PEOPLE FROM ONE
END TO THE OTHER WITHOUT EVER
TOUCHING THE GROUND.
THAT INCLUDES YOUR PLANK.
THEY CAN'T TOUCH EITHER.
THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT
FIGURING OUT A SYSTEM.
WHAT TO DO, HOW DO YOU MOVE
FORWARD.

 I GOT IT.
 Jeff: VERY DIFFERENT
STRATEGY.
BLUE GOING WITH BARRELS ON THE
SIDE.
RED GOING WITH BARRELS STRAIGHT
UP.
 THERE YOU GO.
I GOT 'EM.
PERFECT.
JUST LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: MIKE FLAT OUT RISKING
SLIDING OFF AND FALLING ON THE
SAND TRYING TO SET UP THESE
BARRELS.
MIKE DOING A LOT OF WORK.
A PLANK FALLS BUT DOES NOT
TOUCH.
THE RED TEAM TAKING A MORE
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH.
IT'S A LITTLE SLOWER.
BLUE WITH A LOT OF MOMENTUM NOW,
WORKING TOGETHER VERY WELL.
 SHIRIN, COME ON.
 Jeff: THE RED TEAM IS
MOVING MORE SLOWLY, BUT THEY'RE
STILL IN IT.
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHO
HAS THE BEST SYSTEM.
 COME ON.
TELL ME WHEN THAT BACK ONE IS
GOOD.
 Jeff: THE RED TEAM NOT
PANICKING AT ALL.
MIKE GIVING UP HIS ENTIRE BODY
FOR THIS CHALLENGE.
WE'RE DEAD EVEN RIGHT NOW.
TWO VERY EVENLY PICKED TEAMS.
BATTLING FOR A NICE REWARD.
MIKE IN TROUBLE.
GOT TO RECOVER.
 YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: AND HE DOES.
ALMOST DID THE SPLITS.
 I DO CROSSFIT, JEFF.
 WE GOT IT NOW.
LET'S GO.
PICK IT UP.
 Jeff: MIKE WITH A BIG PUSH.
BLUE HAS EXTENDED THEIR LEAD
AGAIN.
ONE, TWO AND THREE.
 Jeff: BUT ONLY BY A BARREL.
THIS IS BACK AND FORTH NOW.
 THERE YOU GO, BABY.
 ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.
 Jeff: THE LONGER THIS
CHALLENGE GOES ON, THE MORE
ENERGY YOU EXERT, THE LESS YOU
HAVE.
 I THINK WE GOT TO CHANGE IT
UP.
 I THINK WE DO, TOO.
 Jeff: MIKE DRIPPING WITH
SWEAT.
 ONE, TWO, THREE!
 I LOVE CHEESEBURGERS.
 Jeff: RED HAS BEEN VERY
CAREFUL, TAKING THEIR TIME.
IT HAS PAID OFF.
THE RED TEAM IS NOW IN THE LEAD.
MIKE GOT TO BE EXHAUSTED.
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAVE TO
CHANGE FOR BLUE.
RED NOW TWO BARRELS AHEAD.
 WANT ME TO TAKE THE GAMBLE OF
RUNNING ACROSS ONE OF THESE
REALLY QUICK.
 NO, NO, LET'S ALL DO IT.
DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND.
 PLANK IN THE GROUND.
YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO THIS
SECTION.
GET OFF AND GET EVERYTHING BACK
HERE.
HUGE SETBACK FOR THE BLUES.
BIG ADVANTAGE FOR RED.
 WE'RE DOING GREAT.
 JUST FOCUS.
 WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
 Jeff: SIERRA BARREL
ROLLING.
 YOU GUYS JUST START DOING
SOMETHING.
BLUE IS GOING FOR BROKE.
EVERYBODY GOING TO GET ON
BARRELS AND TRY TO ROLL THEIR
WAY TO THE END.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STRATEGY IF
IT WORKS.
 GO, SIERRA.
SHIRIN FALLS.
MIKE IS OFF, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO
GO BACK.
THIS IS LAST DITCH ATTEMPT BY
BLUE TO GET BACK IN THIS AS RED
INCHES CLOSER TO THE FINISH.
THIS COULD DO IT.
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET TO THE
PLATFORM FROM HERE.
TYLER'S ACROSS.
THERE'S TWO.
 COME ON, BROTHER.
 Jeff: THERE'S THREE WITH
WILL.
TYLER, CAROLYN, DAN AND WILL WIN
REWARD.
 YES!
 I CAN'T BELIEVE WE WON THAT.
 Jeff: WILL, TYLER, CAROLYN,
DAN, NICE JOB.
BIG REWARD.
BURGERS ON THE WATER.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 Jeff: YOU'RE VERY SUBDUED.
IS IT THE EXHAUSTION OF THE
CHALLENGE.
 IT'S A HOT DAY BUT YOU CAN'T
HELP BUT FEEL BAD.
RODNEY'S BEEN ON NO REWARDS.
I FEEL VERY BAD.
 Jeff: YOU CAN GIVE YOU SPOT
TO RODNEY IF YOU WANT TO.
 I'LL GIVE MINE.
 GOT OFF THE HOOK ON THAT ONE.
 Jeff: WILL, TYLER, DAN,
CAROLYN, GRAB YOUR STUFF.
 DAN HAS OPTIONS IN THIS GAME.
HE'S A LOOSE CANNON, SO WE WANT
HIM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE SO THAT
INKLING TO GO BACK THE MIKE
NEVER CROSSES HIS MIND, AND
BEING ON A REWARD WITH HIM IS A
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT
POINT ACROSS.
 BYE-BYE, ROSIE.
 JUST THE FOUR OF US.
 I'M SORRY, GIRL.
THE REWARD CHALLENGE STARTED OFF
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
WE HAD A LEAD, BUT LOST IT.
 GO AHEAD AND GET THE FIRE
GOING.
 YEAH.
 IT WAS ME DOING THE WORK
WHILE THREE OTHER PEOPLE STOOD
AROUND AND WATCHED.
 I'M SORRY.
 IT ENDED UP BEING THE LOSING
STRATEGY.
I GOT TO TAKE FULL CREDIT FOR
THAT.
IF MY TRIBE MATES ARE MAD AT ME,
HOW MUCH MORE MAD CAN THEY BE?
I'M ALREADY THEIR NUMBER-ONE
PUBLIC ENEMY.
I GOT NOTHING TO LOSE AT THIS
POINT.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
RODNEY BUT...
 I'M HURTING.
 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE
THIS BEACH ONCE.
I DIDN'T GO ON ONE [BLEEPED]
REWARD.
I'M PISSED.
I'M MISERABLE.
I'M IN THE EATING ENOUGH FOOD.
I'M SHAKING.
I GOT AN ITCHY BEARD.
I HAVEN'T SHOWERED.
MY NAILS ARE NASTY.
DID I SAY I'M MISERABLE?
 I WAS
HOPING I WIN REWARD AND THEN WE
GET INDIVIDUAL REWARD AND YOU
KNOW.
 EVERYBODY'S HAD A BREAK.
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN LOCKED IN MY
CELL 24/7 NOT BEING ABLE TO
BURST OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.
I NEED SOME RODNEY TIME.
FOR MY SANITY I NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE.
 I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU,
BUT TYLER IS GOING TO WIN THIS
GAME.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE IF HE
KEEPS WINNING IMMUNITIES AND
GETS ANY FURTHER, HE'LL WIN.
EVERYONE ON THAT JURY NOW WILL
VOTE FOR HIM.
HE'LL WIN.
HE WILL WIN.
SHIRIN WILL VOTE FOR WHOEVER WE
SAY.
 WE GOT HIM OUT.
I GOT FAITH.
 EVERYBODY'S NOT WILLING TO.
MAKES ME THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING WITH HIM.
 YOU WANT TO GET HIM OUT AT
SEVEN, I'LL GET HIM OUT AT
SEVEN.
BUT I'M TRYING TO GET HIM OUT AT
SIX BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST
SHIRIN.
 AT THIS POINT TYLER CANNOT
ONLY WIN IMMUNITIES.
SO I'M WELL AWARE THAT TYLER IS
A THREAT.
WE COULD USE SHIRIN'S VOTE TO
GET RID OF TYLER BEFORE THIS SIX
BECAUSE HE'S A THREAT.
YOU HAVE TO STRIKE WHEN YOU GET
THE CHANCE.

IF FOR SOME WEIRD
REASON TYLER GOT, THERE WE WOULD
NOT WIN, BUT IF SHIRIN CAME WITH
US, WE WOULD WIN.
NO ONE WOULD VOTE FOR HER.
 I CAN'T SAY TOO MUCH BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE THEM, YOU
KNOW, AND BE ANOTHER MIKE.
 I DON'T TRUST SHIRIN.
SHE IS SO...
 SHE WON'T WIN.
HE WILL.
IT'S NOT THAT TYLER'S A THREAT,
IT'S THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEING HIM
PLAYING A GOOD GAME AND THEY'RE
GOING TO GIVE HIM $1 MILLION.
 TYLER, PEOPLE THINK HE'S A
THREAT, BUT I AM THE BIGGEST
THREAT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING THE
SHOW.
I GOT THE NUMBERS.
I GOT THE RELATIONSHIPS.
I GOT THE PERSONALITIES ON MY
SIDE.
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH
SIERRA.
WE GOT TO STAY COOL, CALM AND
COLLECTED LIKE I SAID FROM DAY
ONE.
MY NEXT MOVE IS TO GET MIKE AND
SHIRIN OUT OF HERE AND GET TO
THE STRONG SIX AND THEN RODNEY
WORKS HIS MAGIC.
 THIS IS GREAT.
HERE WE ARE.
YOU KNOW WHY WE WON THIS
CHALLENGE?
BECAUSE THERE'S NO...
 BECAUSE WE WORKED AT A TEAM.
 BECAUSE THERE'S IN MIKE IN
TEAM.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, WINNING
THAT REWARD, THAT WAS AWESOME.
 GAME'S ON TOP.
 EXACTLY.
 I WILL SAY, EVEN IF WE DO
WANT TO UNPAUSE THE GAME, WE'RE
IN A GOOD PLACE THE UNPAUSE IT.
THERE'S NO MIKE.
THERE'S NO SHIRIN.
THERE'S NO NONSENSE.
 ABSUBTLY.
 NOW THAT MIKE IS ON THE OUTS,
THE FACT I GOT TO GO WITH THESE
THREE, CAROLYN, TYLER AND WILL,
JUST MADE IT EVEN BETTER.
BECAUSE THEY'RE MY ALLIANCE
RIGHT NOW.
 MIKE HAS BEEN LIKE TEFLON.
DOESN'T MATTER HOW HE SCREWS UP,
HE FINDS A WAY TO FIX IT.

YOU
KNOW, THE ONLY REASON WHY MIKE
IS STILL HERE IS BECAUSE HE'S
WON IMMUNITIES.
THE NEXT IMMUNITY HE LOSE, SMELL
YOU LATER.
 WE'RE GETTING BACON
CHEESEBURGERS.
 BABY.
 COUNT OF THREE...
 ONE, TWO, THREE...
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH.
 THIS IS THE BIGGEST HAMBURGER
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 MIKE BELIEVES WITH ALL HIS
HEART THE FOUR OF YOU PLOTTED
AGAINST HIM TO GET HIM OUT AT
NINE AND RODNEY TURNED.
 LOOK, MIKE IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE
THING, HE IS A THREAT.
HE'S A THREAT.
BUT TO SAY WE WERE PLANNING ON
VOTING HIM OUT, THREE OR FOUR
VOTES PRIOR TO WHAT WE AGREED,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STUPID OF
US.
 DAN DOESN'T GET IT.
MIKE WAS CORRECT.
OUR GROUP WAS GOING THE TARGET
HIM.
BUT MY GOAL IS TO KEEP DAN
FOCUSED ON THE OTHERS, ON THE
EVILS, ON THE GUYS LIKE MIKE,
THE FLIPPERS WHO DON'T BELONG.
 WHAT SNAPPED IN MIKE
HOLLOWAY'S BRAIN FOUR DAYS AGO
THAT MADE HIM WANT TO THROW
EVERYBODY UNDER THE BUS, TO TEAM
UP WITH SHIRIN?
 HE WENT PSYCHOCRAZY.
 DAN SHOULD BE WORRIED BECAUSE
HE NEEDS TO BE THINKING FURTHER
ALONG IN THE GAME.
ALL HE CAN SEE IS TOP SIX, AND
THAT'S A PERFECT PLACE FOR HIS
MIND TO STOP.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT DAN CANNOT
SEE BEYOND TOP SIX.
 YOU KNOW SOMETHING, THIS
VOTE, STAY THE COURSE.
STAY THE COURSE.
AM I WRONG?
 STAY THE COURSE.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
MIKE.
TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.
 BRING IT BACK SOON, JEFF,
BRING IT BACK SOON.
 Jeff: YOU HAVE TO EARN IT
IF YOU WANT IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU ARE
ALL GOING TO HOLD ON TO A ROPE
HANDLE ATTACHED TO 25% OF YOUR
BODY WEIGHT.
AS THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES, THE
WEIGHT WILL BECOME TOO MUCH TO
BEAR.
THE ROPE WILL UNRAVEL AND THE
BUCKET WILL TIP.
WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF WATER, YOU'RE
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE THE LAST
MAN AND THE LAST WOMAN STANDING
WILL WIN IMMUNITY.
THAT MEANS TWO PEOPLE WILL BE
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
EVERYBODY ELSE VULNERABLE.
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND
BECOME THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR
HANDLES.
AS COMFORTABLE AS THAT LITTLE
PERCH IS.
THAT'S FOR WHEN YOU'RE OUT.
EVERYBODY ROLL YOUR HANDLE BACK
AND RELEASE THE WEIGHT.
DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY'S IN POSITION.
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
YOU'RE HOLDING 25% OF YOUR BODY
WEIGHT, BUT THE BODY WEIGHT IS
FROM DAY ONE.
WE'RE ON DAY 29.
SO IF YOU HAVE LOST A LOT OF
WEIGHT, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HOLDING
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE.
YOU'LL START TO FEEL IT IN YOUR
FOREARMS, YOUR BACK, YOUR SKIN
WILL START TO TEAR ON YOUR
HANDS.
WE'VE DONE THIS CHALLENGE IN THE
PAST.
IT USUALLY LASTS SOMEWHERE
AROUND A HALF AN HOUR.
THIS IS A LONG TIME TO BE
HOLDING ON TO THAT BAR.
SIERRA'S BAG SLOWLY STARTING TO
DROP.
THAT'S AN INDICATOR OF THE ROPE
UNSPOOLING.
 SWEATY PALMS.
 Jeff: TYLER TRYING THE
CHANGE HIS GRIP UP.
DAN TRYING TO WRENCH IT BACK UP.
 IN THE TRYING.
SUCCEEDING.
 Jeff: DULY NOTED.
RODNEY TRYING THE WRENCH HIS
BACK UP.
 OH, NO.
 Jeff: SIERRA STRUGGLING TO
HAND ON THROUGH THE SWEAT,
DROPPING A BIT MORE.
SIERRA NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
CAROLYN AND SHIRIN NOW IN A
BATTLE FOR THE FEMALE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
TYLER STRUGGLING TO SAY IN THIS.
HIS BAG IS STARTING TO DROP.
TYLER DROPS OUT.
FIRST MAN OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
WILL CANNOT HOLD ON ANY LONGER.
WILL DROPS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
DAN DIGGING IN AGAIN, BUT THAT
ROPE SLIPPING MORE.
THAT WATER READY TO TIP.
 MY FINGERS ARE NUMB.
 Jeff: SHIRIN STARTING TO
STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT.
 YOU HAVE TO CRANK IT BACK.
 Jeff: CAROLYN HOLDING
STRONG.
MIKE HOLDING STRONG.
TRYING TO WRENCH IT UP AND IT'S
WORKING AGAINST HIM THAT.
BAG CONTINUES TO DROP.
 I'M SORRY.
I GAVE IT UP.
 Jeff: DAN IS OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.
WE'RE NOW DOWN TO TWO MEN AND
TWO WOMEN.
IT IS RODNEY TAKING ON MIKE AND
IT IS CAROLYN VERSUS SHIRIN.
SHIRIN'S BAG IS SLOWLY INCHING
CLOSER TO THE GROUND.
 HOLD ON, CAROLYN.
HOLD ON.
 INCH BY INCH.
 Jeff: CAROLYN IS GETTING
CLOSER TO WINNING IMMUNITY.
SHIRIN DROPPING MORE.
IT'S ABOUT OVER FOR SHIRIN.
 YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS.
AND THAT IS IT.
SHIRIN IS OUT.
CAROLYN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
FOR THE WOMEN.
AND WE ARE NOW DOWN TO TWO MEN,
RODNEY AND MIKE.
 OH, YEAH, BABY.
OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: CAROLYN HAS THE
NECKLACE FOR WOMEN.
EITHER RODNEY OR MIKE WILL HAVE
IT TONIGHT FOR THE MEN.
 YOU MAY NEED IT BUT YOU WANT
IT.
YOU WANT IT, BABY.
 HANG IN THERE, HOT ROD.
 HE'S MOVING.
HE'S MOVING.
 Jeff: BOTH GUYS ARE FEELING
IT.
THAT WE KNOW.
WHO CAN HOLD OFF THAT PAIN, PUSH
IT AWAY.
 NICE.
 Jeff: DAN GIVING RODNEY A
LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT.
DEDICATION, MOTIVATION.
RODNEY'S BAG DROPPING A LITTLE
MORE.
 COME ON, RODNEY.
 Jeff: MIKE WON THE LAST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
WOULD LIKE TO DO IT AGAIN.
 SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
TAKE A SECOND.
 Jeff: SWEAT DRIPPING OFF
BOTH GUYS.
RODNEY WORKING ON THAT GRIP.
RODNEY STILL IN THIS.
 COME ON, COME ON, BABY.
HE'S TWITCHING, DUDE.
HE'S TWITCHING.
YOU GOT IT, BABY.
YOU GOT IT.
ANGEL OVER YOUR SHOULDER.
 Jeff: RODNEY'S BAG DROPPING
ANOTHER LITTLE BIT.
 BABY, DIG.
 COME ON, BABY.
 Bianca: MIKE STILL HOLDING
STRONG.
RODNEY GOING BACK DOWN.
GOT TO DIG IN NOW, RIGHT NOW.
 DON'T LOOK AT HIM.
JUST FOCUS.
DIG IN AND HOLD.
 Jeff: HIS BAG CONTINUES TO
DROP.
RODNEY STRAINING, GIVING
EVERYTHING HE HAS.
KEEP DIGGING.
 DIG, DIG!
 Jeff: DAY 29 FOR IMMUNITY.
RODNEY CAN'T DO IT.
RODNEY IS OUT.
MIKE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW.
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
HUGE BATTLE.
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT OUT HERE.
CONGRATULATIONS, CAROLYN.
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
RIGHTS NEXT TO HER, MIKE YOU
WANTED IT BACK, YOU EARNED IT.
YOU GOT IT.
MIKE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
GOING HOME TONIGHT WILL BECOME
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
GOOD EFFORT.
 I HELD ON FOR AS LONG AS I
COULD, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH AND
CAROLYN WON.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EPIC BECAUSE
MIKE WON IMMUNITY, I WOULD HAVE
WON IMMUNITY AND THEN WE WOULD
HAVE SEEN THE AXIS OF EVIL
SCRAMBLING ALL DAY, BUT IT
WASN'T MEANT TO BE, AND SO I
HAVE NOW GOT TO SCRAMBLE.
 THAT WAS CLOSE.
 I KNOW.
 SO CLOSE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 I WANTED THAT NECKLACE MORE
THAN ANYTHING ON THIS PLANET,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE FACT
THAT SHIRIN DIDN'T GET THE
NECKLACE, BECAUSE IF SHIRIN GOT
THE NECKLACE, ONE OF MY ALLIANCE
MEMBER COULD HAVE BEEN GOING
HOME.
 LET'S NOT FREAK OUT.
WE KNOW IT'S SHIRIN.
WE'RE ALL IN.
EASY VOTE.
DONE.
S A LITTLE A WRENCH IN OUR PLANS
MIKE TO GO HOME. TONIGHT IS
EVERYONE'S VOTING FOR SHIRI
ESE WE'D HAVE TO SPLIT WITH OWN.
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ALL RIGHT, DAN.
GO STRAIGHT TO IT.
 WE'RE NOT EXACTLYE OF
PEOPLE TO MINCE WORDS.
 I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
YOU DO TRUST ME. I'M LISTENING.
 THINK YOU'RE ALLY
STUPID TO VOTE ME
I'M NOT A THREAT AT CHALLENGES
AND I'M NOT A THREAT TO WINHIS
GAME.
YOU KNOWT, YET YOU HAVE HUGE
TYLER.
 IN DREAMRIO, OF
COURSE I'D LOVE TO SIT NEXT
SHIRIN IN THE FINAL THREE, WHO
WOULDN'T.
KES HER. ARE LITERALLY VOTIN OUT
SOMEBODY THREAT IN
ANY WAY, WHO YOUOULD GET OUT
NOW, NEXT GET
OUT ANY TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE
END OF THE GAME AT WILL.
YOU'RE VOTING ME OUT.
 I AGREE WITH YOU.
I AGREE WITH SINGLE THING
YOU'RE SAYING...
 IF YOU HAD ANY POWER, IF
WERE TRULY STRATEGIC, YOU WOULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
OUT.
DAN, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME,
HE'S GOI VOTE ME OUT OUT THE
THREAT.
DAN, YOU ARE BEING STUPID.
MOVE.E GOING TO HAVE T
ANCE... ALLIANCE, BY DEFINITION,
IS NOT WITH YOU TO THE END.
THERE'S SIX OF YOU.
PRESUMAB
INTERNAL ALLIANC THERE.
BUT LIKE I HAVE NOTHING.
SO I REALLY AM WITH YOU UNTIL
THE END.
RIGHT.
WHO DO YOU THINK THEN TODAY?
IGGESTALLENGE THREAT AFTER MIKE.
 UH-HUH.
 I KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU
I'LL VOTE WITH YOU TO THE END.
LIKE IF I HAD WAY, I WOULD
GO WITH AND CAROLYN ALL THE
WA SHIRIN SHOULD BE TAKEN TO TH
END BECAUSE SHE WON'T GET VOTES.
SHWON'T WIN IMMUNITY
I'M NOT DUMB.
I'M NOT BLIND.
I KNOW TYLER IS A
 I'M BEGGING YOU.
 BUT IF I HAD TWO PEOPLE
BACKING ME THAT WERE COMFORTABLE
WITH IT.
OF COURSE I WOULD GET RID OF
TYLER TONIGHT.
 WE KNOW THAT DAN'S GOT
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.
AND IT'S IN HIS BAG.
SO IT COMPLETELY PEAKS MY
INTEREST AND IT PLANTS THE SEED
IN MY MIND, "WHAT'S IN HIS BAG?
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET INTO
HIS BAG.
I WALK UP, GRAB THE BAG AND RACE
OFF IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF HIS
BAG.
AND I READ THAT DAN'S ADVANTAGE
IS ONE EXTRA VOTE.
DAN HAS ESSENTIALLY A VOTE
MULTIPLIER.
 I GRABBED DAN'S BAG.
BASICALLY WHAT IT IS IS HE GETS
AN EXTRA VOTE AT TRIBAL.
 WOW.
THAT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE.
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO
USE IT NOW.
 WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS THAT
DAN AND SIERRA COMBINATION.
IF THEY ACTUALLY SAW HOW
DANGEROUS OUR FOUR IS, THEY
COULD FLIP, REJOIN WITH MIKE AND
SHIRIN AND USE THE ADVANTAGE TO
VOTE ME OUT.
 I'M GOING THE TRIBAL IN A
LITTLE BIT.
 YEP.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
 NOT GOOD.
 WHY NOT GOOD?
 IT WOULDE EASY FOR YOU GUYS
TO WHIP OUT AN IDOL AND PROTECT
BOTH OF YOURSELF AND KILL ME.
 THAT' POSSIBILITY.
 I WON
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
IT FEELS PRETTY AWESOME.
AND TODAY I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING, BECAUSE I'M
SAFE.
BUT I'M NOT GUARANTEED TO WIN
THE NEXT IMMUNITY, SO I GOT SOME
TO DO IN ORDER TO GET
MYSELF FURTHER IN THIS GAME.
WHAT IF TONIGHT IS THE LAS
NIGHT THAT YOU CAN G AND
YOU DON'T DO IT?
YOU GO TO THE END OF GAME
AGAINST TYLER AND YOU LOSE.
 I AGREE.
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.
 YOU...
 YOU GET BROWNY POINTS FOR
MAKING A WIG MOVE.
 IF I MAKE IT TO THE END, I
MADE ENOUGH MOVES TO GET THERE
AND I CAN POINT OUT ALL THE
MOVES THAT I HAVE DONE ALONG THE
WAY.
 THERE WAS A TIME IN THIS GAME
WHEN I WOULD HAVE SAID DAN WAS
MY STRONGEST ALLY, BUT I SCREWED
UP AND I WISH THERE WAS A WAY
THAT I COULD CONVINCE HIM OF HOW
LOYAL I TRULY AM TO HIM.
BUT DAN IS UNWILLING TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE.
SO NOW I SEE WHAT KIND OF PERSON
HE TRULY IS, AND IT'S SAD THAT
YOU PUT YOUR FAITH AND TRUST IN
SOMEONE AND THEY TURN OUT BEING
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN YOU THOUGHT
THEY WERE.
 SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT,
BUD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TURN ON
YOURSELVES NEXT VOTE ANYWAY.
I'M WINNING IMMUNITY.
THIS WHOLE GAME I'VE BEEN
PLAYING 90 TO NOTHING.
THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME
STRATEGY TO BE THOUGHT OF ABOUT
USING THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
TONIGHT, FOR THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT I COULD GET A BIG THREAT
OUT OF THIS GAME.
 I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE
YOUR HEAD IS AT, IF YOU'D EVEN
CONSIDER.
 YOU'RE ASKING US TO GET RID
OF TYLER IN EXCHANGE FOR SHIRIN.
 WHO WILL NOT WIN ANYTHING.
 EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE
VOTING SHIRIN.
I COULD LITERALLY GIVE THE IDOL
TO SHIRIN AND SHAKE THIS GAME UP
AGAIN.
LET'S SEE WHERE THE CHIPS FALL
AND MAYBE THOSE CHIPS WILL FALL
IN MY DIRECTION.
 Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
HALI, JOE AND JENN VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SHIRIN, I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU WERE SHARING VERY
PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE ALONE, YOU HAVE NO
FAMILY AND YOU WERE EXPLAINING
WHY YOU HAVE NO FAMILY.
AND YET A LOT OF PEOPLE COME
INTO THIS GAME AND SAY, WELL,
BACK HOME I GOT MY FAMILY, I CAN
TRUST THEM.
 YEAH.
TRUST IS VERY HARD TO COME BY IN
MY LIFE.
I HAVE A MOTHER THAT MEANS A LOT
TO ME EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT
CLOSE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE WENT
THROUGH.
LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT I'LL BE
SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE WITH ARE
MY BOYFRIEND AND HIS FAMILY AND
MY BEST FRIEND, AND THAT'S
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS.
 Jeff: DAN, YOU'RE SAYING NO
IT'S NOT.
 I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING
AWAY FROM SHIRIN, BUT I'M AN
ADOPTED CHILD.
ALL I HAVE FOR BLOOD IN THIS
WORLD IS MY MOTHER.
I HAVE MY ADOPTED FAMILY, MY
WIFE, HER FAMILY, FRIENDS I
CONSIDER MY FAMILY, BUT MY
SCENARIO REALLY ISN'T MUCH
DIFFERENT THAN HERS.
 Jeff: SO YOU HAD DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE IN YOUR UPBRINGING?
 I'M AN ADOPTED CHILD.
 Jeff: DAN, NOT TO SPLIT
HAIRS, BUT THAT'S A VERY BIG
DIFFERENCE.
 IN THE TAKING ANYTHING AWAY
FROM WHAT...
 JEFF, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
HERE APPRECIATE WHAT I'VE BEEN
THROUGH AND HOW WRONG WHAT WILL
DID TO ME WAS.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE
VERBALLY ASSAULTED ME AND HE
TOOK MY FAMILY SITUATION AND
REALLY MADE LIGHT OF IT.
 Jeff: DAN, IS THAT JUST THE
WAY IT GOES WHEN THERE'S $1
MILLION ON THE LINE?
 NO.
BUT I WASN'T THERE WHEN IT ALL
WENT DOWN.
AND I TOLD HER I WAS SORRY THE
WHOLE THING HAD HAPPENED.
 BUT NOTICE NONE OF THEM ARE
SAYING WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG AND
NONE OF THEM ARE TELLING WILL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR
THE THINGS YOU SAID BECAUSE YOU
CROSSED A LINE.
 Jeff: WELL, YOU AND SHIRIN
STILL HAVE NOT PATCHED THIS UP.
 NOT AT ALL.
 Jeff: YOU HAVE NO
INTENTION.
 NOT AT ALL.
 Jeff: WHY NOT APOLOGIZE?
WHAT IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE END
AND SHIRIN'S THE VOTE AND ALL
SHE WANT WAS AN I'M SORRY.
 BECAUSE IF I'M GOING TO
APOLOGIZE, I WANT IT TO BE
SINCERE.
THAT'S THE GAME.
 IT'S NOT A GAME WHEN YOU MAKE
IT PERSONAL.
I MEAN, JEFF, LET ME JUST GET
RIGHT TO THE CHASE, YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE THE ABSOLUTE DUMBEST
THING HAPPEN TONIGHT AND THAT IS
ME GOING HOME.
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT I'M
NOT A THREAT, AND YET WE'VE GOT
SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTUALLY WON AN
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, TYLER,
SOMEBODY WHO COMES CLOSE EVERY
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE, TYLER,
SOMEBODY WHO WILL TAKE $1
MILLION FROM EVERY SINGLE OTHER
PERSON HERE EXCEPT FOR MAYBE
MIKE, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE JUST
WANT TO FOLLOW THE NUMBERS.
THEY DON'T WANT THE TAKE A RISK,
AND FOR THAT REASON THEY WILL
LOSE $1 MILLION.
 Jeff: TYLER, SHE PUT YOU ON
THE HOT SEAT WITH A COMPLIMENT.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, MY
ALLIANCE KNOWS THAT I STAND WITH
WITH THEM, I STAND STRONG WITH
THEM, THAT WITHOUT THEM I'D BE
RIGHT OVER THERE.
 Jeff: SIERRA, SHIRIN MAKES
A SOLID ARGUMENT.
WHEN DO YOU TAKE OUT THE THREAT
AND WHEN DOES SOMEBODY WHO IS SO
NOT A THREAT ACTUALLY BECOME
SOMEBODY YOU SHOULD TAKE TO THE
END?
 SHE'S 100% VALID, BUT, JEFF,
I'M ONE VOIGHT.
AS ONE PERSON, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO CHANGE A FEW
PEOPLE'S MINDS, PERHAPS YOU'RE
NOT IN THE STRONG POSITION IN
YOUR ALLIANCE THAT YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN.
 BUT WE DO HAVE A SIX-STRONG
ALLIANCE, AND TIMING AND MOVES
IN THIS GAME ARE CRITICAL.
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE MOVES
TOO EARLY IN THE GAME BECAUSE
WHEN YOU DO, YOU COULD MAKE THE
WORST DECISION OF YOUR LIFE.
 Jeff: SO MIKE, HOW BIG A
VOTE IS THIS, BECAUSE IF IT GOES
THROUGH AND SHIRIN IS OUT, THAT
MEANS YOU HAVE TO KEEP WINNING
OR YOU ARE OUT OF THIS GAME.
 ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.
BUT I WIN THIS ONE MORE TIME,
AND THEY GOT TO START
CANNIBALIZING THEMSELVES.
I'VE BEEN BLUE STRONG THE WHOLE
WAY.
AND I'M ASKING THE BLUES,
SIERRA, RODNEY AND DAN, PLEASE
WRITE A NAME THAT STARTS WITH A
"T" AND YOU GUARANTEE YOURSELF A
FURTHER SPOT IN THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AND THEY'RE LISTENING
TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR LOYALTY HAS
BEEN SPOT ON IN THE LAST WEEK,
IS THAT RIGHT?
 WELL, WE WILL SEE.
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
 YOU THINK YOU'RE ONE OF THE
SMARTER PLAYERS IN "SURVIVOR"
HISTORY?
SOMETIMES LOOKING AT AN ALLIANCE
AND REALIZING, HEY, WE GOT A
GUARANTEE TO THE TOP SIX AND ALL
WE GOT TO DO IS SHUT UP, PUT
BLINDERS ON, TUNE OUT THE
NONSENSE AND JUST ELIMINATE
PEOPLE.
AND WE PLAY BALL WITH PEOPLE WHO
ARE SMART ENOUGH, PATIENT ENOUGH
TO SIT BACK AND WAIT.
OR IF SOMEBODY REALIZES THAT
THEY ARE ON THE BOTTOM, THEY
WOULD MAKE A MOVE, BECAUSE GOING
OUT AT SIX MAKES NO SENSE.
THIS GAME IS WAY TOO HARD.
 THE THING IS, JEFF, BEFORE
THE STRONG SIX, IT WAS A SEVEN
WITH MIKE INVOLVED.
HE FLIPPED AND MADE HIMSELF A
TARGET WHEN IF HE STUCK TO THE
PLAN OF THE SEVEN, THIS GAME
COULD BE OPENED UP A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.
 Jeff: ABSOLUTELY.
IF MIKE'S ACTIONS AT THAT MOMENT
WAS THE START OF EVERYTHING THAT
FELL BEFORE HIM, SO NOW MIKE IS
HAVING TO ANSWER FOR THE
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS.
AND LIKEWISE, SO IS SHIRIN.
THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING AT THIS
POINT TO STAY IN THE GAME.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT DESPERATE
PEOPLE DO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
BEFORE WE GET TO THE VOTE, LET'S
SEE IF THE TWO DESPERATE PEOPLE
HAVE ANY LAST WORDS.
MIKE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
I KNOW SHIRIN AND I ARE NOT
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
I'M PULLING OUT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, JEFF.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THIS
SIX IS DIVIDED.
 CAN I SEE IT?
I CAN SEE IT?
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT?
SO HERE'S THE PLAN, JEFF.
SHIRIN'S VOTING FOR TYLER.
I'M VOTING FOR ONE OF THE OTHER
FOUR THAT DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY.
AND YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES.
THREE PEOPLE CAN VOTE TYLER AND
GUARANTEE THEMSELVES A SPOT,
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOING TO TAKE
FOUR WHEN I PLAY THIS.
 Jeff: SO, MIKE, YOU'RE
SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE YOUR
IDOL TO SHIRIN AND ANY VOTES FOR
SHIRIN WON'T COUNT.
THE CAMP VOTES FOR YOU.
SHE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR TYLER
AND YOU'RE GOING TO THROW A VOTE
TO SIERRA, WILL, RODNEY OR DAN.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: THIS REALLY IS
SURVIVOR RUSSIAN ROULETTE.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE
IS NOT A BULLET IN THAT CHAMBER
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, MIKE IS
SAYING YOU BETTER VOTE TYLER,
OTHERWISE IT COULD BE YOU.
GOING TO MAKE FOR A VERY
INTERESTING VOTE.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SHIRIN, YOU'RE UP.
 JUST SIT THERE AND LOOK
PRETTY.
 OH, BOY, I HOPE THIS WORKS.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 LOVE YOU, GIRL.
 Jeff: OKAY.
ONCE THE VOWS ARE READ, PERSON
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED THE
LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE.
TYLER.
SHIRIN.
DAN.
ONE VOTE TYLER, ONE VOTE SHIRIN,
ONE VOTE DAN.
TYLER.
THAT'S TWO VOTES TYLER.
SHIRIN.
THAT'S TWO VOTES SHIRIN.
DAN.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES TYLER, TWO
VIETS SHIRIN, TWO VOTES DAN.
SHIRIN.
THREE VOTES SHIRIN, TWO VOTES
TYLER, TWO VOTES DAN.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
SHIRIN, YOU NEED TO BRING MY
YOUR TORCH.
 NICE JOB, BROTHER.
 DAN STILL GOT TWO VOTES.
 I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS, IN
MY OWN WAY.
 Jeff: SHIRIN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 BYE, SHIRIN.
 Jeff: WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF
I'VE EVER BEEN THIS CONFUSED
AFTER A VOTE.
BECAUSE FOR ALL OF THE TALKING
OF A TIGHT SIX, THE VOTES SAY
OTHERWISE, AND YET NOBODY FROM
THE SIX SEEMS TO MIND.
SHOULD MAKE FOR A VERY
INTERESTING FINISH TO THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF
IS I HAVE TO PUT DAN.
 THE ALLIANCE OF SIX BEGINS TO
CRUMBLE.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHEN YOUR NAME IS THE OTHER ONE
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN OUT THERE, I
HAVE TO WRITE SOMEBODY ELSE'S
NAME DOWN.
 A BUNCH OF FAKE-ASS PEOPLE.
I'M DONE.
 AND RODNEY REACHES HIS LIMIT.
I WANT TO BE VOTED OUT.
I WANT TO BE ON THE JURY NEXT.
 NO HARD FEELINGS.
WE ACTUALLY GOT A COUPLE PEOPLE
TO FLIP AND SHOW WHO, IN FACT IS
AT THE BOTTOM.
DAN IS A SENSITIVE GUY.
HE DOES NOT LIKE TO BE VOTED
AGAINST.
SO I HAVE A FEELING THAT TONIGHT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A
WAKE-UP CALL FOR DAN.
I'M EXCITED TO BE PART OF THE
JURY TO SEE IT ALL PAN OUT.
