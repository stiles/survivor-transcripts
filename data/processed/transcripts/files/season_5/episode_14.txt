        JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago,
16 Americans began
the adventure of a lifetime
in exotic Thailand.
They journeyed
to Tarutao Island,
a former prison camp
and one-time haven for pirates.
You're going to choose
your own tribes, right now.
In keeping with
the Thai tradition of honoring
the elders, the two oldest
castaways, Jake and Jan,
were allowed to pick
their own tribes.
TED:
I was surprised by Jan's picks.
It seems like
most of the tribe members








were older members,
if you will.
Survivors ready? Go!
PROBST: From the beginning,
it looked as if
the older Chuay Gahn tribe
would be the underdog.
Sook Jai wins immunity!
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry about it. -No.
But Sook Jai
had trouble bonding.
I'm not here to be
yelled at by you, dude.
I'm not yelling at you, sweetie.
I'm saying I want
to sleep tonight, okay?
How'd you sleep last night?
Pretty good, huh?
My point exactly. Walk away.
PROBST: And they let
their youthful enthusiasm
get the better of them.








No, no, no!
Chuay Gahn proved they could be
strong competitors.
Chuay Gahn wins reward!
But they also had
their own bumps in the road.
For some crazy reason,
you know, in that position,
I started grinding on Ghandia.
To me, I got the feeling that
you was trying to get with me.
No. No. No.
I'm not even attracted to you!
PROBST: The castaways
have experienced
the hardships of island life.
(screaming)
He probably pushed off
on a stingray
and got a stinger in his foot.
Damn, it ... hurts!
HELEN: It was a nightmare. At
one point I was about ready--
if I had a pistol in my pocket,
I would've pulled it out,
shot her first, shot me second.
PROBST: And they have
experienced the joys
of an exotic land.
SHII ANN: It was just wonderful
to be able to see
some of Thai culture.
CLAY:
It is absolutely gorgeous.
You got these limestone cliffs
and mountains
and hills and caves.
There's no way to describe
the beauty th-that's here.
PROBST:
They have clashed...
I'm not ... stupid.
...and they have
overcome their differences.
I'll tell you what,
you're a good man.
I like you.
ROBB:
Amen, bro.
But no matter
how strong their bond,
Tribal Council always loomed.
In the first 18 days,
three members from Sook Jai
and three members from Chuay
Gahn were voted off the island.
On day 19, the two tribes
moved onto one beach,
and the castaways
believed they had merged.
One, two, three.
Family!
(cheering)
But that wasn't the case.
-You said, "merge."
-Yes.
I certainly didn't say anything
to give you that impression,
did I?
The two tribes never merged.
The false merge
sent strategies reeling
and put desperation
right out in the open.
This is not a tribe unified.
Penny, you're manipulative.
I've had plenty of opportunity
to vote Shii Ann out
if I wanted to.
PROBST: Sook Jai lost
another member, and the tribe
was at a numbers disadvantage.
Living on the same beach
as two separate tribes
was a trying experience
for everyone.
KEN:
The cave smells of urine.
Chuay Gahn has been pissing
in the front of the cave.
Cashew butterscotch squares.
-Ooh, that sounds good.
-Ooh, one of those.
JAKE: My God. You know,
I need to go somewhere else
when she starts
that recipe stuff,
which is nonstop, 24/7.
PROBST:
Even the monkeys were
testing the
castaways' patience.
All the bananas that were saved
for tonight are gone.
Oh, no.
Sook Jai continued
their downward spiral...
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
...and lost another member.
When the merge finally
materialized on day 26,
the remaining Sook Jais, one by
one, had their torches snuffed.
Last week, the time came
for the former
Chuay Gahn tribe
to turn on each other.
Ted and Helen questioned Clay's
contributions to camp life.
TED:
I think the reason why
he's been around
this long is because
he's a comical character,
he keeps us laughing.
But it's just time for him
to be voted off.
PROBST: At the reward challenge,
Ted won a new car...
-Ted wins reward!
-Yeah!
Yeah, baby!
...and chose to
take Helen with him
for a Thai dinner and massage.
Welcome.
Sawat-dee kha!
Sawat-dee kha!
PROBST:
Ted downed the wine...
Ah!
...and tried to solidify
the plan to vote Clay out.
Clay.
-Yeah.
-Out of here.
You got to be quiet about that,
-you know what I'm saying?
-Oh, yeah.
I forgot where I was.
PROBST: Back at camp,
the rest of the tribe
was growing nervous about
Ted and Helen's friendship.
What were you saying earlier
about all the whispering?
Who was doing the whispering?
Teddy and, um, Helen.
And writing in the dirt.
Hmm.
PROBST:
But when Helen returned,
she shared Ted's plan
with Brian.
You know, I sat and listened
to everything he said,
and I "yeah, yeah, yeahed" him
to death.
-Yeah, I know, I know.
-Agreed, agreed, agreed.
Let Ted believe
what he thinks he believes.
HELEN: I'm definitely playing
two sides of the fence.
Everybody out here is playing
both sides of the fence.
Just hope you don't get caught.
PROBST: Strategies and alliances
were in question
when Brian won
the immunity challenge.
Brian wins immunity!
Good job, Brian.
So Ted asked Brian straight up
if he was the next to go.
I'm asking you,
brother to brother.
Okay.
Am I the next to go?
No. Uh-uh.
At Tribal Council,
Ted felt the sting of betrayal
when he was
unanimously voted out
and sent off to join the jury.
Ted, the tribe has spoken.
Now, only four remain.
Tonight, they will compete in
their final
immunity challenges.
Two will move on to face
the jury, one will outlast
all the rest and become
the sole Survivor.
He didn't have too much to say
on the way out, did he?
He wouldn't even turn around and
look at us when he was leaving.
(bats squeaking)
Y'all, there's only
four torches.
JAN:
Yeah.
JAN:
Last Tribal Council was
a little bit harder
because Ted was
the first of the, of the last
Chuay Gahn five.
Uh, it was the beginning
of the realization
that each one of us have to go,
except for one.
HELEN:
Ooh.
BRIAN:
Nice.
Let there be light.
CLAY: We knew that
when we got to this point,
we was getting rid of Ted.
It was a total shock to Ted.
The whole time we'd been telling
him, "We're kicking Jan off,
we're kicking Jan off."
There ain't no telling
what went through his mind
when he saw his name
pop up three times.
I'm sure he was furious.
Mm-hmm. No hard feelings;
we got to do what we got to do.
BRIAN:
That's part of the game.
(yawns)
HELEN: At this level
in the game,
it becomes cutthroat.
It becomes
every man for himself.
So the next couple days I expect
to be extremely stressful.
Final four-- sounds like
a basketball tournament.
JAN: I know it.
That's all I can think about.
You know.
JAN:
Isn't that funny?
HELEN:
Oh, my gosh!
Santa Claus came, Clay.
CLAY:
Good Lord.
HELEN:
Oh, look, it's everybody's name.
-BRIAN: Oh.
-CLAY: Oh, neat.
JAN:
Oh!
HELEN:
Here we go.
"Lotus-shaped boat used in
different Thai celebrations
"and a way of remembering
those with whom
"you have shared its gifts.
"You have 12 floats to decorate
"in honor of
the 12 fallen Survivors.
"All deserve to be memorialized.
"Give each krathong the care
and respect they deserve.
"You will be instructed
as to when and where you will
offer up these gifts
to the sea."
-All right. -Okay, let's take
them all back to camp. -Okay.
CLAY: This morning, we got an
early treemail; it was a bunch
of flowers,
and we're supposed to fix up
a float for each tribe member
that's been kicked off
the island, and, uh,
there's some kind of tradition
in Thailand
about sending something
out to-to sea.
You know, a message
out of love and hope
and good luck in-in the future.
I think that's...
it's-it's what it's all about.
We got a job to do, people.
-This is an example?
-JAN: Right.
Well, wait a minute, I got some
tweezers or something in here.
I need toenail clippers bad.
Toothpicks.
Oh.
HELEN: Oh, man,
I've been dying for that.
We'll do them in order.
BRIAN: We're gonna go down
the assembly line.
JAN:
Oh, that looks real good.
HELEN:
That looks really nice, Clay.
CLAY:
I looked at each individual,
and tried to put them
as I saw them.
We just tried to
fit the personalities
into each little float
that we're going to send out
to sea later on.
Erin was going to get
a lotus tattooed
on her foot. Why don't we
give her this lotus?
CLAY:
Okay.
JAN: With 16 different
personalities, you're going to
have people that generally
don't really like each other,
but you learn to get along.
So even if you had
someone's wreath
that you weren't
particularly crazy about,
you still made it good.
BRIAN: Why you spending so much
time on Ghandia's, huh, Clay?
I'm fittin' to stick
your ass with a pin.
(chuckles)
I'm being nice,
'cause nobody else will do it.
BRIAN: When I was
making those wreaths,
all's I thought about was, uh,
"You've come a long way, baby."
You've had to make
some tough decisions,
but I would so much rather be
in my position than looking at
one of those wreaths,
seeing my name on there.
This is a business trip,
strictly.
My attire is just
beard and, uh, uh, bathing suits
out here.
But I'm still in business mode.
CLAY: We got to get
the immunity today.
Okay. Either-- and then we'll
wor... worry about tomorrow.
But the best thing
is not to talk about it.
-Oh, okay. -So they don't,
you know-- Okay, good.
Oh!
Check the inside.
No. Okay.
On top.
That's cool.
There's no ifs, ands
or buts, Clay.
No ifs, ands or buts.
-No. Won't happen with me.
-Okay.
I mean, this is
outside the game.
Fine. That's right.
We got treemail, guys!
Oh, great!
Dust off your sail.
The one brain sail
you have left.
Oh, no.
"Cell," not "sail."
Oh.
(chuckles)
"Only fools repeat mistakes,
and hindsight's 20-20.
"So cash in
on what you've learned
and get closer to the money."
Okay.
-Well, that's-that's obvious...
-Yeah. -Yeah.
...what it is.
What?
What we've learned, here.
Oh, okay, yeah.
-Hello, guys.
-Hello, Jeff.
Hi.
Okay, at this point in the game,
with only three days left
and only four people left,
the only way
to control your fate
in this game is with immunity.
So let's get to today's
immunity challenge.
It is, appropriately enough,
called Second Chance.
A chance to revisit
certain aspects of challenges
you have tackled in the past.
On my go, you will
dig up a wicker ball.
Take that wicker ball with you
over the bamboo balancing beam.
If you fall,
you got to start over.
When you've succeeded,
take your wicker ball
through the fishnet tubing.
When you're finished with
that part of the course,
you're done with
the wicker ball.
You'll put it on your torch.
You'll begin work
on the slide puzzle.
Once you release the knife,
use the knife to cut the rope.
The rope will release
a bag of materials.
Take those materials with you
into the jail cell.
Use the materials
to build a pole,
retrieve the key,
unlock the door.
It's then a sprint
to the final buffet table,
where we have a surprise
food item from our Thai menu.
First person
to finish the course
and show me an empty mouth--
meaning you have consumed
the food item entirely--
-(chuckles): Oh, Lord.
-wins immunity,
is guaranteed a spot
in the final three.
Stakes have never been bigger
than this challenge.
-Make sense?
-Yeah.
Before we begin,
Brian, I need that immunity.
Immunity back up for grabs.
Let's go.
Here we go, guys.
Immunity at stake
and a guaranteed spot
in the final three.
-Survivors ready?
-Yeah.
Go!
Clay's the first one out
with his wicker ball.
Heading for the balance beam.
-Back to the start, Clay.
-Sand makes you slip.
Jan has her ball, starting on
the bamboo balance beam.
Gets two steps in.
Keep digging, guys.
What, China?
Clay's halfway.
Helen has her ball.
Clay's off the balance beam.
Clay is through
the fishnet tubing.
Not a big lead, guys.
Keep working it.
Brian's got his ball.
Everybody's on the bamboo.
Clay's just a little bit ahead.
Keep moving, guys.
Still very much in this.
Brian's off the bamboo
and through the fishnet.
(mutters) Oh! Whoa!
PROBST: Guys on the balance
beam, look where you're going.
Brian making his way
through the fish tubing.
Brian creeping up on you, Clay.
Way to keep fighting.
(screams)
Brian has his knife out.
Screwing up his puzzle so Clay
can't look over and copy.
Brian's moving into
the jail cell.
CLAY:
I'm trying, I'm trying!
PROBST: Brian's starting work
on his pole.
That a way, Helen. You're there.
You're halfway there.
It's a sprint to the bottom now.
Go, Jan.
Brian's got his key.
That a way, Helen.
Right back in it.
Brian's out of the jail cell.
Hallelujah!
-That a way, Janny!
-Yes!
Got to eat it all?
PROBST:
You got to eat it all, brother.
Don't mess around.
Put that thing down
and start chewing.
Keep it down.
Let me see that whole mouth.
Brian wins immunity!
That was nasty.
You have come a long way.
One of you will go no further.
Somebody's going home
after Tribal Council.
Oh, boy.
Even as I was doing it,
I could feel myself
getting so angry I was shaking.
HELEN:
I hate to lose.
I hate to lose.
And I hate to look like a fool
doing it, and I did both today.
That damn balance thing.
I just felt like
I looked like an idiot.
Ever since the immunity
challenge was over,
the minute I knew
I didn't have it,
I was like, okay, now what?
BRIAN: It looks like
it's time for Helen to go.
Why Helen now at this time is--
there was some sort of
relationship with her and Ted;
it just happened the other day.
There was some writing
on the ground.
So I have a little distrust
in Helen.
I know they were
scheming against us.
I mean,
Jan was supposedly sleeping,
they were doing stuff
in the dirt here.
-Oh, I saw... I saw writing.
-Placing in order.
When I raised up and looked,
they started playing like
they was playing Tic Tac Toe.
It's some sort of order
they were going.
So that, uh-- I know that,
uh, Helen's
-going to go down fighting
tomorrow, no matter what. -Yeah.
She's a threat, and she's making
me nervous now with everything
the same and I'm not still in
the picture and--
I'm just getting--
she's making me nervous.
BRIAN:
Helen's got to go now,
simply because
she's a threat to me.
Jan, you know where
the vote's going, correct?
-Me?
-No.
Who?
-Helen.
-No.
I-- this is the first
I've heard of it.
This is strictly strategy,
just think about it.
It's not your turn.
BRIAN: Jan-- she's my ace
in the hole,
and I will use her, uh,
tonight.
As long as
everything goes as planned,
she'll come into play.
Now, whether, uh, whether
everything does go as planned,
that's one thing
I can't control.
You can't get emotional
over this decision.
-Right. -It's strictly
a strategic position.
-Right.
-But if you're not
comfortable with it, then-then,
uh, I-I understand, also.
But I would, uh, just like you
to, uh, think about it,
and that's, I mean,
that's the way
we would, uh,
kind of like to go.
-Right.
-I mentioned it, also, to Clay.
You understand, you're-- it'll
be helping your pocketbook, too.
And it's you or her.
I just, you know,
I don't want y'all to be saying,
"We're putting Jan out"
and then, you know...
I'm not... I'm not playing a
game. No, we're not playing--
I'm going to take her out
in about an hour
-Uh-huh.
-and talk to her.
You have to just understand that
you're now-- can be three.
-Mm-hmm.
-Which is quite a feat.
But the time has come
to make a decision.
And, uh... it's Helen's time.
Are you okay with that?
I just want to think about it
and see, and, um,
you know, I'm just, I'm just
going to ponder what's going on.
Is that a deal, Jan?
Let me just, let me just take
a nap and rest on it, guys.
Yeah, I'll think about it.
And I'd appreciate you--
-Thanks, guys.
-Get... Get some rest.
No, thank you, Jan.
Oh, my one cell
is being very overworked.
-(laughs)
-It's all strategy.
That's all it is.
Oh, God,
I'm going to kill myself.
I have been approached
for a new game plan, and,
um, I am toying with
the suggestion.
Helen is a friend of mine.
She has cooked the meals,
she sings at night
to help calm us down.
So I feel like
I'm in a quandary.
That makes me anxious.
She can't change her mind.
What we'll do, we'll change
our vote and vote her.
I think she'll be okay,
she just needs to relax.
I don't know.
Hope it works.
The only other issue is
what I'm going to tell Helen,
if I, if I'm going to.
It's going to pop up her name
three times
and she'll get the message,
for sure then.
HELEN:
Weeks ago, Brian and Clay
came to me and said, uh, "How
about us three for the top?"
The vote that was agreed upon
was start with Ted, then Jan,
then when we get to us three,
then we'll reevaluate.
Well, I know darn well
Clay sees himself
in those first two chairs.
So it worries me
that they may decide that Jan
is an easier person
to keep along, so I
checked last night to make sure
it was still a Ted vote-- yes.
Okay. Checked today with both
of them, it's still a Jan vote.
Now, you can ask him.
Don't you think you ought
to just not talk
about it with Janny?
You think it's fair
to tell Jan she's going?
CLAY:
I think you ought to leave...
That just makes her
upset all day.
Soon as we got here,
she went back down in the cave.
Just let her by herself
and let her get through the day.
Don't upset her.
HELEN: Brian and Clay
have had it with Jan.
They're frustrated with her.
I mean, that's the story
they're giving me and that it's
a definite
she's out tonight.
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake
and our newest jury member, Ted,
voted out at
the last Tribal Council.
Just before we voted
at the last Tribal Council,
I asked, at the time the five of
you, if anybody felt vulnerable.
Everybody shook their head
and I said,
"So that must mean
everybody feels safe,
which means somebody
is clearly being lied to."
And from where I sit, they were.
You voted out Ted, and I don't
think he saw it coming.
So now we have a jury made up of
four Sook Jai members and one of
your own Chuay Gahn members,
for all intents and purposes,
you betrayed.
Clay, smart way
to play this game,
knowing your fate
is in their hands?
Uh, I wouldn't call it betrayed.
I mean, everybody has to be
removed from the game
to get down to the final two.
That's the way
this game is played.
And, uh, lying is
part of the game.
This a-a-a game
of people playing people.
Who do you trust
by looking them in the eye?
I'm sure I've said some things
where I wanted people
to take them another way.
-It kept Clay in the game.
-PROBST: So, Jan,
you basically looked
another tribe member in the eye
and lied to them.
They're now on the other side.
Well, I didn't lie to him.
I just voted
to keep myself in the game.
So maybe I'm making
an assumption.
So, then, was it a coincidence
that everybody
voted for Ted except Ted?
(chuckles)
Uh... uh, I-I have...
I don't know.
I don't think so, but I did not
say one thing to Ted
about going to vote against him.
But he did not ask me, either.
Brian, have you lied
in this game?
No, I've not lied.
I've, uh, changed my mind
a few times.
There's been, uh,
certain situations
where things could have been
put out in the open,
friendships could have
remained blossoming, but, uh,
some people have chosen
to take other routes
and have, uh, decided
to actually, uh...
uh, to deceive.
So you think
you've been lied to?
Yes. I've been deceived.
And that's expected to happen,
and, uh, it just...
you don't think it's going
to happen, uh, to you.
Helen,
think you've been lied to?
Oh, I know I've been lied to.
Clay,
think you've been lied to?
Know for a fact
I've been lied to.
And, uh, I just dealt them
a card right back.
PROBST: So how is there
any loyalty at all
-in this game at this point?
-CLAY: There's not.
The only safe move
in this game--
if you got that necklace on,
and that's it.
We're three vulnerable
right now.
He's safe; we're not.
So, clearly, Helen,
at this point,
how can you trust
any of these people
when you walk up there to vote?
You can't.
Flat out, you can't.
It's getting down
to the wire, and, um,
you tell someone honestly, "This
is who I'm voting for tonight,"
and then, all of a sudden,
maybe right before the vote,
you get a signal from your bloc,
"Uh-uh, that's not the way we're
going; we're going this way."
And then you go, "Oh, great."
This person now says,
"You lied."
And, to them,
that's the way it is.
So let me ask you the same
question I asked Jan earlier.
Was it coincidence that Ted
ended up with all the votes,
or was there one of these blocs?
It was a bloc.
Clay, knowing you're already
a little in trouble
with four Sook Jai members,
maybe we should tell Ted
he's still going,
and maybe we'd get a little
loyalty from him in the end.
Uh, I looked at this way--
I wouldn't want to know,
and, uh, I need to get rid
of the biggest people
that I feel most threatened by.
We're not talking $20;
we're talking a million dollars.
And you're not judged
on your... your lying
or your performance on this game
as you are in life.
This is a game,
and, uh, we're here
to play it the best we can
and win.
It is time to vote.
Brian.
Cause and effect.
You caused this effect.
You got busted, uh, talking
on both sides of the fence.
You're a hell of a cook,
and I'll miss you,
but I will kiss the cook
later in life.
Good-bye.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.
The person
will be asked to leave
the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote.
Helen.
Helen.
That's two votes-- Helen.
Jan.
The 13th member voted out
of the tribe:
Helen.
Need to bring me your torch.
Helen, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
You've lasted 37
very tough days.
You've made it
to the final three.
And tomorrow will be one
of the most memorable days yet.
So head back to camp.
Get some sleep.
Well, that was a shock.
Um, especially since I asked,
uh, Brian directly if I should
plan on coming back tonight
and I was given
an emphatic yes.
So I guess, of the three knives
in my back right now,
uh, that's the one
that smarts the most.
So, uh, the three of you
that are left, break a leg.
And I mean it.
CLAY: A very memorable
and emotional day.
JAN (sighs):
Thank you, guys.
CLAY:
You're welcome. Thank you.
JAN: When we came back
as the final three,
it was one of those
good/sad things for me.
-Thank you, Brian.
-Thank you.
JAN: I felt a little empty
without Helen
because I thought
she had worked hard,
and, um, I thought she still
deserved one of the places.
BRIAN: I didn't think
Helen would lose it,
but she actually lost it
the last couple days.
-She did.
-I... I didn't, either.
I mean, everything was fine
up until, uh, recently,
then all of a sudden,
she got real antsy
and nervous and sketchy.
CLAY: When, uh, Helen saw her
name pop up for the third time,
I hope it felt like a truck
hit her right in the stomach.
Whammo! We slapped you
right in front
of your Council members.
And, uh, you know what?
You still got to vote
for one of us,
and all three of us
voted for you,
so who you going to blame?
Let's just kind of hold here...
Watch your toes.
Watch your feet.
JAN: We got back
from Tribal Council,
then all of a sudden,
we had treemail.
Um, okay,
I'm going to go in here.
On top? Oh...
Here's... Oh. Oh, my gosh.
-JAN: What is it?
-That was quick.
-What is it?
-Look.
I don't see it.
Oh, no, it's Helen's riverboat.
Oh, it's just... that's awful.
JAN: We went down there, and
there was, uh, Helen's thing
for us to make
to float down the river.
I felt a little bit bad.
I just thought it was real soon
to be feeling
like you buried someone.
Okay. "Before you sleep,
make one last krathong
in memory of the person
you've just set adrift."
-Okay. -What about getting
over here and we'll start it?
I'm going to tie a spoon--
one of the spoons that we
cook with-- around her, uh, lei.
JAN: And I wanted
to make sure that we
did a good one, you know,
so we put a spoon on it
'cause, uh, of her cooking
and everything.
CLAY:
Here we go.
No, that's a good idea, I think,
with the spoon.
-JAN: I thought so, too.
-Yeah.
BRIAN: I wanted to make sure
she had a proper burial.
I called her my Aunt Helen,
but I almost felt closer to her,
like somewhat of a sister,
but I'm wondering now if she's
the sister that went bad.
BRIAN:
That is a beautiful, uh, sight.
CLAY: Looks like a picture
somebody painted.
-BRIAN: Yeah, it does.
-JAN: Uh-huh.
I swear, look at the red lines
going straight here to us.
That is too cool.
Wish I had a belly full of food,
but I don't.
And some coffee.
CLAY: Me, Brian and Jan, we're
just sitting there talking,
and I was playing
like I was, uh...
started drinking
a cup of coffee.
And I said, "Oh, by the way,
I got some donuts over here."
So I passed out the donuts,
and we were just eating donuts
and drinking coffee--
like, we were just really
getting our belly full.
-We got three pancakes,
two eggs, -Bacon.
one strip of bacon,
small glass of orange juice
and a cup of coffee.
Ask... go ahead
and send me my breakfast.
I want the pancakes
and the bacon and the sausage.
There's a canoe.
Wait, there's a boat!
-Who is that?
-There's a canoe out there.
CLAY: All of a sudden,
we see this boat pull up.
It's Jeff!
There's Jeff standing up
in that... this little boat
had three, uh,
uh, umbrellas on it.
Hey, guys.
Welcome to our home.
Nice to be welcomed.
I come bearing the items
you will need
for your final rite of passage.
This boat will carry you
on your journey.
This map will lead the way.
You will leave your beach,
paddling north,
out around the island
to the Mangrove River.
When you reach the river,
you'll begin to release
your loy krathongs.
The krathongs are a tribute
to the 13 other Survivors
who have been a part
of this adventure...
Oh, I'm going to cry.
...but are no longer
in the game.
This is a part of the tradition
here in Thailand.
It is where you offer
your respects,
so take a moment
and reflect over each person.
As you continue down the river,
you'll reach a cave.
I'll be waiting for you at your
final immunity challenge.
-Great.
-Okay.
When do we need to leave?
Pretty quick?
-You go now.
-Okay.
-CLAY: Okay, y'all ready?
-BRIAN: Yeah.
-PROBST: You'll head out north.
-Go right around here?
-You'll know it--
big change in water. -Okay.

-BRIAN: Where are we?
-CLAY: Whoa.
-JAN: Oh, my gosh.
-BRIAN: Wow.
CLAY: Lord have...
Y'all watch your step.
BRIAN: Okay.
Follow the path.
Come on in. Place your torches
on the stand to the left.
It is hot in here.
It's about 105 degrees.
Welcome to the belly
of the whale,
your final immunity challenge.
Congratulations
on making it this far.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
You guys have overcome
tremendous odds,
battled obstacles, crossing
threshold after threshold,
getting closer and closer
to your reward.
The treasure. The money.
And the title of sole Survivor.
It's fitting
that this final ordeal plays out
here in the darkest part
of a cave that was once the home
to the pirates
who ruled this island.
You know, it's so easy
in this game of Survivor
to let the money slip
through your fingers.
Lose a challenge, make a bad
political move at camp,
trusting when you shouldn't.
13 of your fellow Survivors
have done just that.
The three of you
are still holding on.
The question is,
for how much longer?
That's right.
Today's challenge is simple.
Don't let the money slip
through your fingers.
There are 18 coins in front
of you, six for each of you,
three for your left hand,
three for your right.
You'll put the coins
between your fingers
and keep them there.
You will then
go into a traditional Thai
stance called the khon,
and you will stand in this
position with the coins
between your fingers
for the duration
of the challenge.
The frames behind you will
force you to stay in place.
It will be uncomfortable.
It will grow to be painful,
especially for your legs.
You will want to quit.
It's a test of your willpower.
And the longer you last,
the more difficult
it becomes to achieve your goal.
Slowly, those coins will begin
to fall through your fingers.
When all six of your coins
have fallen through your fingers
into the wok below,
you're out of the game.
Last person left standing
wins immunity--
guaranteed a spot
in the final two--
and with that immunity,
gets to decide who comes
with them to that final vote.
Stakes have never been bigger.
Concentration needs to be keen.
Block out everything else.
I'm gonna ask you now
to come forward one at a time
and grab six coins.
Jan, you first.
Keep them in your palms.
Brian.
Clay.
Now I'm going to ask you guys
to take off your shoes.
I'm going to ask you
to take your coins
and put them between your
fingers, three on each hand.
Center them up.
I want you to step up
onto your platform.
Put your head,
your hands and your feet
in the brackets,
palms facing up.
Guys, for the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.
Challenge is on.
There'll be some
initial discomfort.
It'll turn into pain.
But if you use your mind right,
you'll block it out.
Get into a good zone,
you'll be all right.
Jan, what do you reckon's
the first thing you're
going to do when you get home?
First thing I get away from
here, I'm having four beers--
two in each hand--
and a big, fat pizza.
That's exactly
what I'm going to do,
and try and find some sucker
with a cigar
and con it off of him,
and then laugh.
PROBST: Brian, what are you
thinking right now?
I'm just relaxing.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Clay, what are you going to do
when you get out of here?
What's the first action you're
going to take when you get home?
Get something fattening
and hug the hell out of my wife.
She's supposed to have a pie
waiting in the car for me.
You guys are doing great.
This is the point where it
starts to get
a little painful.
Work through it.
Stay focused
on your own game, guys.
It is designed to hurt.
It's designed
to test your willpower.
You're at the hardest part
right now.
You are in the darkest part
of this challenge.
You guys have come way too far
to give in now.
Remember, guys, it's also
important to stay in your game
mentally in relation
to the other players.
The image you put forth
affects them-- gives them power
or takes it away.
I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I can't.
That was me.
Sit down, guys.
Have a seat.
-Stretch it out.
-Way to go, Brian.
Time to... time to get out.
-Okay. Everyone gone?
-Yeah.
PROBST:
It's yours, Brian.
Good job, guys.
CLAY:
Way to go, Jan.
You gave it all you got.
Way to go.
For the third time in a row,
take it.
-CLAY: Feel good?
-Yeah. Thanks.
PROBST: All right, guys,
here's where we're at.
For the third time,
Brian has immunity
and a very big decision to make:
which one of you two to take
with him to the final vote.
That's what you have
to think about today.
I will see the three of you
tonight at Tribal Council.
Take your torches.
Make your way back to camp.
What a morning.
You guys, are your legs
still like rubber?
CLAY:
Still really hurt.
JAN: Today, walking
into the last challenge,
I knew I had to beat Brian
and Clay, but my legs
were just quivering like that,
and I had sweat coming down,
and, uh... um, I just couldn't
take myself to that next level.
BRIAN:
Wow. What a dramatic challenge.
(thunder crashes)
That's what I felt like.
That's just what I felt like.
That's... my whole body felt
like lightning going through it.
There was a major burn going on
all throughout the legs.
Then it went to the butt,
the lower back and the neck.
But I made it through and, uh,
took that immunity home
for the third time in a row.
CLAY: This is our final Tribal
Council before there's two
that's going to have to sit
before the jury.
I feel very confident
that Brian's gonna go in
and set Jan on the jury
as the seventh member
and I'm going to set
up there as, uh,
one-two and let
the jury vote on us
and, uh, see
who gets the million.
BRIAN: I'm thinking
about the whole picture.
Simple as that.
I-I know it's
a $900,000 mistake
I could be making, but there's
a lot... a lot here at stake.
Putting me up against
a 53-year-old lady
that's done not much,
yet she hasn't done anything
to step on anybody's feet.
Clay's played the game very
similar to me, so I'm not sure
of how the votes are going to
go; I really don't know.
Get your little rod.
CLAY: The only reason
I can think Brian
taking Jan to the final two--
it'd be an easier win.
He-he may walk up there
and just
blow me right out of the water.
I mean, we... me and him
have blown two out of the water
in the last two Tribal Councils
that just absolutely thought
no way that they
were fixing to leave,
and we sent them home.
And he may be doing it to me,
but, uh, I'll have to see it.
I don't believe it.
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake,
our newest member, Helen,
and Big Ted.
So let's talk about today.
I have to imagine it was
a pretty emotional day
for you guys.
-Jan?
-Yes, it was very emotional.
And it started
really the night before.
We had to make the floats
for everyone
and take them and let them go
and, uh, remember who we'd met,
and, uh, it was...
it was very bittersweet.
Any one memory
in particular stand out?
Uh, of the floats?
Uh, yes.
The one, uh...
was most was Helen,
'cause we put spoons on the top
of it for her 'cause she cooked.
It was very emotional for me.
And when I let her go, I said,
"You know, you're not
a Survivor friend.
You're a friend for life."
PROBST:
Clay, how was it for you today?
Really, I turned each one
of them loose,
and every one of them
meant something.
You know, here we are
from all-all over...
all across the United States,
and, uh, we're all Americans,
but yet we live so different.
We had a hell of a time,
you know, every one of us.
-It was neat.
-PROBST: Well, Brian,
for the third
Tribal Council in a row,
you have immunity.
Really big vote tonight,
because not only are you
voting somebody out,
you're also keeping somebody.
Strategically, it's huge.
How many times today
have you thought
about this in terms
of a $900,000 decision?
Back and forth, it's like
a tennis match in my head.
Ping-Pong, tennis.
(imitates sound
of bouncing ball, chuckles)
This is where you've got
to control those emotions
and you've got to look,
uh, tactical
as well as, uh,
business decisions.
What's going to make sense?
Uh, what's... what's fair?
So that's what I've been
kind of, uh...
uh, teeter-tottering with,
as I like to say.
Okay, here's how the voting
will work tonight.
Jan, because you cannot vote
for Brian
and you cannot vote
for yourself,
-you can only vote for Clay.
-I know. Right.
Clay, you can only vote for Jan.
Your two votes
cancel each other out.
-No sense in you voting.
-Right.
Therefore, the only person that
will vote tonight will be Brian.
You'll cast one vote,
and in doing so,
you will vote out
the 14th member,
and more importantly, you will
decide who is going with you
to the final Tribal Council.
Having said that,
it is time to vote. Brian.
(sighs)
BRIAN:
You've come a long way.
A long, long way.
Congratulations.
Been my pleasure.
I will go tally the vote.
Once the vote has been read,
the decision is final.
Person voted out
will be asked to leave
the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the vote.
The 14th person voted out
of the tribe.
Jan.
Need to bring me your torch.
Jan, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
I love y'all. Thanks.
We love you, Jan.
-Good luck.
-Good luck.
Thank you.
(whispers):
You're welcome.
There's nothing left to be said.
You two have gone as far
as you can go in this game.
You have one day left.
I will see you
at the final Tribal Council.
Good night.
JAN: My experience on Survivor
has just been totally surreal.
I didn't know
I could ever be here 38 days
in a bat cave
with rats and snakes.
If there's one thing
I've learned, it's:
don't listen to the word
you can't do something.
Don't quit.
I'm a teacher.
I don't want any of my students
to ever quit anything.
CLAY:
I thought all day long,
"What would I do
if I was in Brian's shoes?"
You know, a million dollars
is a lot of money.
That could make a man
change his mind,
but he stayed true, and, uh,
when he turned it over,
it said "Jan," and, uh,
I was a happy man.
Now we got a guy in his mid-30s
and a guy in his mid-40s
just kicked all them young
people's ass, didn't we?
-Didn't we, though?
-Thank you again, sir.
BRIAN:
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, too.
-We started with the preacher.
-Oh, yeah.
That's right.
We did, didn't we?
CLAY:
We got a boat that's just
the heaviest boat
I've ever saw in my life,
and it has been a burden in
our butt ever since we got here.
BRIAN:
The burning of the boat
was like a cleansing
of the soul.
It was a pain in the ass!
BRIAN: I wanted to get rid
of any sort of, uh...
uh... bad energy.
-CLAY: Bye, boat. No more water.
-BRIAN: Bye, boat.
No more problems.
(Clay yelling, Brian whooping)
All right, we did it, daddy.
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations. Thank you.
CLAY: We're finished... we're
finished with the water runs.
We're finished paddling places.
We're...
we're finished gathering
clams and crabs.
It was, uh, nice to see it go.
Wow. It's over.
It's actually over.
Knew that sun would come.
Look at it peeking its ass up
-up on top of that deal. -Oh,
yeah. Look at that thing. Wow.
Look at that big old sun.
CLAY:
39, baby.
-Ooh!
-Whoo!
Last day.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
Wow.
What a beautiful sight.
The last coconut.
You know what? It doesn't have
dirt all over it, either.
-Look at that.
-Mm-hmm.
CLAY: Day 39 is the most
memorable time of my life.
I would not change
anything I've done...
any experience I've had
in the last 39 days.
My gosh.
BRIAN: We're literally down
to hours now.
This isn't days.
This isn't weeks.
We are down to hours.
Okay.
Excellent job, sir.
Thank you.
Good job to you, too.
Appreciate that.
CLAY: If you look at
the whole game, each one of us
had to do something
for the other one to survive.
So somewhere in there,
all 16 people
ended up having to help the
other one live on this island.
We suffered a hell of a lot,
but when you're looking
back on it,
wow, what a memorable event.
That's it, Clay.
-We're out of here.
-We are out of here.
BRIAN:
We both had fun.
We both brought meaning
into this.
We're now sitting
in the, uh, winner's circle.
You can't get any higher
in this game,
and it's now up to a jury
to decide our fate.
Yeah, this is strictly
a game to me.
It's about building
relationships
and cutting your losses
to move onto the next level,
to get to a certain position.
But the relationships
that you built
weren't necessarily real.
That's a sad fact of reality--
that this game
is a little brutal.
This game is dangerous.
If you don't have strong skin,
you're going to be done quick.
Just over the last couple days,
things have gotten
pretty, uh, touch and go,
and there might have been
some opinions formed
in how cutthroat I am.
It's a little scary
to be sitting up there
with the spotlight on you,
interrogated.
CLAY:
Everybody respects Brian.
He's a class act.
But, uh, Ted and Helen
felt like they had
a pretty solid base
with old Brian,
and, uh, they may feel
more betrayed by him than me.
I'm sure all 16 of us
come out there
definitely not wanting to be
the first one kicked off.
Well, somebody had to be
the first one kicked off,
and somebody's got to win
the million.
It's just all the stuff
in between these two people
that i-is the problem.
I wish all of us here
could get a million dollars,
but we can't.
It ends up with one person--
one lone Survivor--
and, uh, I still got
one more to beat.
We'll now bring in
our full jury of seven members.
Erin, Ken, Penny, Jake, Helen,
Ted and our newest member, Jan.
Welcome to your final
Tribal Council.
Let me start
by saying congratulations.
Thank you.
It's a little bit
different tonight.
In the past,
the power of the vote
resided on this side
of the flame.
Tonight, that shifts
to the other side of the fire,
to our jury.
Seven people that either
directly or indirectly
you had a hand in voting
out of this game
now have your fate entirely
in their hands.
Tonight, they'll be voting
for a sole Survivor.
We'll begin with opening
statements by the two of you,
why you deserve
to win this game.
The jury will then get a chance
to address
each of you individually
and ask you a question.
They're looking for information
to help them make
a big decision.
And then we vote.
Let's start with our
opening statements. Clay.
Wow. What do I say besides, uh,
I'm a lucky guy?
I'm, uh, sitting here,
and I'm not sitting over there.
The-the-the hard part
of this game is,
uh, we're people--
we're not pieces of a puzzle--
and, uh, somewhere in there,
I had to tell some untruths
and put y'all over there.
And I can promise you this, uh,
if y'all could replace
my seat here,
y'all would do
exactly like I did.
Everybody came to play
the hardest they can,
and I did, too,
and I'm sitting over here.
Th-this is a hard, uh...
uh, thing to say.
Yes, I want the million.
Million dollars at age 46
would mean...
definitely a life-changing,
uh, deal, you know.
Everybody goes
through bad luck, and, uh,
unfortunately,
I'm just coming out of some...
a little bad luck and, uh,
starting on my road up again.
And what a jump, what a boost
that would give me.
It's up to y'all, and, uh,
I know it's
a super hard decision,
because regardless
of what y'all make,
y'all had to live
with both of us for a while.
Good luck.
Brian.
Well, uh, first of all, I just
want to say it's been
a pleasure, uh, knowing each
and every one of you
through these, uh, days that
we've had to know each other.
Uh, we've all had
positive experiences,
and we've all had
some bad experiences.
And I think that there's been
some form of leadership
through example,
leadership through merits.
There's been no complaints
on my part.
There's been no stories
fabricated for, uh, sympathy.
There's been just a positive
outlook, I think, every day
on a... on a daily basis.
But, uh, you know my focus--
my focus was making sure
everything was okay,
uh, making sure we all had, uh,
food in our bellies,
making sure we were all warm
at night.
Um, along the way, uh, you
develop some friends, but this
is a game, and there were
certain people that had to go,
uh, before others,
and that's what sucked.
Uh, but I dealt with it
the best way I could,
sometimes by not
saying anything.
So, uh, vote
from your hearts, and, um,
look at the whole time that
we've either known each other
and, uh...
and feel good about it.
That's all I'm asking for,
is you guys feel good
about whatever
you're going to do, and, uh...
uh, I respect every one of you
in your own way,
and it's been, uh... a pleasure
knowing you all.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Okay, jury, had a chance to hear
what Clay and Brian had to say.
In a moment, you're going to get
a chance to ask them a question
that will give you
information you need
to decide who will be
the sole Survivor.
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.
PROBST:
Okay, jury.
Had a chance to hear
what Clay and Brian had to say.
It's now your chance
to address them.
This is your opportunity
to ask a question from them
to give you
the information you need
to make a very big decision.
Erin, we'll start with you.
-Hi, guys.
-Hello. -(whispers): Hi.
Um, I've sat and listened
through every single
Tribal Council.
Now, we've already heard
why you think you deserve
the million dollars.
Now I want to know
why each of you think
the person sitting next to you
does not deserve
the million dollars.
I think we'll start with Brian.
I think Clay
does not deserve the million
because over a period
of, say, 39 days
he did not put forth
the effort that he could have.
There's a lot more spunk
in this little man
than I think we've seen,
and, uh, I think he coasted
through a few, uh, scenarios.
He was more of a thinker
whereas I was more of a...
of a doer.
Clay?
Uh, he, uh...
he thought he was the leader
of the camp, and, uh,
there was times that he thought
everybody should come to him,
and, uh, they didn't always
have to come talk to Brian.
You know, there's other
tribe members they could go
discuss, uh, things with
without, uh,
him getting defensive
or trying to worry
about what they're
talking about.
If, uh, he had
so much power in camp,
uh, he wouldn't have had
to worry about that.
-Okay.
-PROBST: Satisfied?
Satisfied.
Thanks, Erin.
Ken.
-Hey. How you guys doing?
-CLAY: Hey, guy.
-Okay.
-Clay, you said that, um,
there's not a person over here
that would, uh...
that wouldn't do what you did
to change places.
Well, you're wrong.
I wouldn't do it, okay?
I was straightforward
to everybody,
I never lied,
and I kept my integrity.
Okay, that's
what I go home with,
'cause that's
the only thing a man
can go home with
at the end of the night
after everything's gone.
Okay.
Brian, when we first arrived
at Chuay Gahn,
you told me that Ted had to go,
that he'd never make it
to the final two,
and there's a reason he wouldn't
make it to the final two.
So why don't you tell the jury
why Ted had to go?
I didn't ever mention
Ted had to go.
KEN: Okay, le-let's...
let's rewind again.
Remember, I know the answer
to this-- you told me this--
so just tell the jury
what you told me.
Why was...
why did Ted have to go?
That's all I want to know.
Uh, Ted had to go because he had
a problem, uh, uh,
forming together with a group.
So there was a feeling of Ted
kind of breaking off,
doing his own thing.
So that was the reason,
I think--
the lack of, uh...
uh, gelling with the group.
-Okay.
-Simple as that.
-I-I'm...
-PROBST: Ken.
Ken, I just want
to make sure I'm clear.
Brian told you something.
KEN: Well, Brian just told me
two different things,
which neither one of them
are what he told me
when this was originally
done here,
when we originally talked
about it.
There's no big deal here.
I'm satisfied.
-I'm not going to push him
anymore. -PROBST: Okay.
Did you get the honesty?
-No, I did not.
-Okay.
-And you're satisfied?
-I'm satisfied. I mean, that's
between him and... him and God.
Penny.
When we came
into this merger, um,
we obviously didn't
have the numbers.
We were down,
you know, five to three.
But knowing
that I was just a number
and I was eventually going to be
voted off based on that,
I still took the time
to get to know both of you.
But did you really bother
to get to know who I am?
-Okay.
-Uh, for example, Brian,
do you know where I grew up?
In Texas.
-Do you know where in Texas?
-Um...
I want to say, uh, Beaumont.
Somewhere in Beaumont, Texas.
That would be Jan.
Do I have any siblings?
And if I do,
what are their names?
You've got... an older brother.
Or an older sister.
No, I'm the oldest.
You're the oldest. Okay.
And I don't know their names.
Is there anything
you want to add, Clay?
Well, I know you are a huge,
uh, Texas Tech Red Raider fan,
and, uh, I'm real impressed
that, uh, Colleen,
your-your future sister-in-law,
is planning your wedding.
When you was in high school,
you made a huge decision,
and, uh, you were living
with your daddy
and went to living
with your mother.
You didn't get to spend
all your childhood
with your sister, and, uh,
you really do regret that,
but y'all have got a...
a real good relationship,
uh, going now.
I don't know what else
-to tell you. That... All right.
-That's fine.
I'm satisfied.
-Thank you.
-Thanks. Uh-huh.
-Good luck.
-Thanks, Penny.
Thank you.
Jake.
Hi, guys.
-Hey.
-You're kind of in
the hot seat tonight,
aren't you?
Oh, I'm telling you.
I'm kind of glad, in a way,
that I'm over
on this side of this fire
and not on that side.
I also want to tell you that
I don't know how you did it,
but, boy, did y'all do
a number on me
by taking a person
who I had a strong alliance with
and getting her to vote
against me, and that was Penny.
Which I thought was just
a really clever,
manipulative move.
Now, on that very night,
Jeff asked,
"Does anybody feel like they
might get voted out?"
And I said, "Yeah, I-I feel
pretty vulnerable tonight.
"I'm just excited the fact
that Brian stated
"that the vote is going to be
on performance,
"because let me tell you,
"I do know that I perform
as good as anybody out there
and probably better than most."
Now, we had just gotten
back to camp, and, Clay,
you really blasted me
about the fact that I'm next.
My question is this.
Why did you feel threatened
for what I had said,
which was only the same
repeated what Brian said?
CLAY:
The reason that it upset me--
because when you come to camp,
within, uh, 15 minutes,
you started trying
to make an alliance with me.
Then you're trying to make
an alliance to Ted.
Then come out,
you're talking to Brian,
trying to make another one
with him.
You was trying to play me with
all of my own tribe members,
and you didn't think
we wasn't going to talk?
You were wrong.
All right.
Now, Brian, how did you feel
at that point?
I was working hand in hand
with you.
You were out there clamming
with me, getting food.
No, at the time,
I did not feel the same way,
to answer your question.
-Satisfied?
-Satisfied.
Thanks, Jake.
Ted.
First to you, Brian.
Brian, um, you know,
the way you played this game,
you truly are a great,
great car salesman.
You sold me your friendship.
You sold me your understanding
of... of cultural diversity.
And most of all,
you sold me your word,
all to find out that each one
of those qualities were lemons.
Clay, you, on the other hand...
I mean, you sit there
only because you rode
the coattail of Brian.
I really, really,
really did overestimate you.
You're nothing more
than an ignorant
Southern redneck hillbilly.
That's fine.
My question to you is,
how do you define
a racist person?
I don't know of a racist remark
I-I-I said.
So you're basically telling me,
behind my back,
you've never made
any racist comments?
-About you? No.
-About me.
I-I didn't.
If I did, I sure didn't mean to.
TED:
Okay. So...
what is Clay's definition
of a racist person?
-I think... Okay.
-"Well, my definition
-of a racist person is... this."
-I think that...
Ted, I think a racist person
that tries to belittle
the other race,
whether it's white, black,
brown, pink or purple, whatever.
TED:
Okay.
Part two of this question:
What can you say to convince me
that you're worthy of my vote?
I was, uh, fair with Ted.
You were fair with me?
Yeah.
-100% fair with me?
-Mm-hmm.
Brian, is that true?
No.
-Okay. -I have...
I don't have anything else.
-Okay.
-That's it.
Thank you, Jeff.
-Thanks, Ted.
-Mm-hmm.
PROBST:
Jan.
JAN:
Okay.
Hi, guys.
-Hey.
-38 days
I was with y'all,
morning, noon and night.
Um, Clay, I know you think
you worked very, very hard.
In comparing everything,
I want you to, uh, explain to me
that you worked harder
than Brian
in the total work
of the water and the food,
and making the tribe live
and survive on day-to-day.
As far as getting food, yes,
I-I-I very well did my share.
As far as swimming
and getting the water,
he did swim a whole lot more
than I did to go get the water.
And, uh, I asked him, I said,
"Brian, I'll go."
He said, "No, you...
you got other things." And, uh,
I said, "If you... when you-you
want me to go, I'm ready to go."
And he said,
"No, I got it," and, uh,
-so I stayed at the house.
-Okay.
Now, Brian, will you defend, uh,
your comparison of the workload
as compared to Clay, please?
On a daily basis, I would clam.
Every two to three days,
I would get water.
Uh, every night, I would
make sure the fire was, uh...
uh, keeping us all warm,
as well as, uh, tending
to the wonderful soup
that, uh... uh, allowed us
to survive for so many days.
I knew what had to be done,
and I was more than willing
and able.
Okay. Thank you.
They... I'm satisfied.
Helen.
Well, we spent 37 days together.
And I had my mind made up
week two
who I was going to vote for,
but that got ripped
right out of my mind
the night I left here.
I asked you, Brian, point-blank
if I was going, because you
and I had that thing going.
We had that trust,
that we'd give the other person
the courtesy of telling them.
But you and Clay
told me Jan was going.
And Jan appeared
to me really upset that day.
And I went to both of you,
and I said, "You know what?
I think she deserves
to know she's going."
And you both looked right at me
and said, "No.
"Leave her alone.
She knows she's going.
Why make her miserable?"
Knowing full well
that you had turned the tables
on me.
You promised me it was us three
going to the threesome.
But neither one of you
were man enough to tell me.
Clay, it doesn't surprise me
from you.
You lived up to exactly
what I thought you were
the whole time out there.
But, Brian, felt like I was
living the Julius Caesar play.
I wanted to turn around
and say, "Et tu, Brute?"
You are the epitome
of the trashy used-car salesman,
and I have to tell you
it really hurt.
You duped me,
you made a fool of me,
you strung me along, and you
let me sit here and get stunned.
So now is your opportunity
to tell me
why you didn't give me the...
the decency, after all
that time, to tell me,
and then follow up
with why I should vote for you.
Sure.
When... about two days prior,
when, uh, you and Ted
thought Jan was sleeping,
there was a pecking order
that you were scheming with Ted
that was told to me through Jan.
It was, uh, written in the sand.
I was extremely surprised,
coming from you.
I felt just as betrayed
as you did at the time.
I felt hurt.
I felt, uh,
we did have a relationship.
We had a friendship.
I felt you misused the trust.
You scheme up a plan
to go against me...
And I told you, Brian,
that if I ever changed my mind
that I would tell you first.
I never came to you
to tell you that
because I never changed my mind.
Your name was never
on my ballot.
I'm asking you
your specific reason
for not telling me that night
as we were walking out.
Because of the knife
that you put in my back
through the, uh...
what Jan told me.
Hearsay? Hearsay? Something
that didn't come from me?
-She saw it. She heard it,
Hel... -Something that you
didn't ask me about,
this is what you're going on?
-You played a game with...
-This is what
you're going on?
This is what you're going on?
-Hearsay? Mm-hmm.
-Yes. Yes.
You didn't come to me
and ask me?
I was hurt,
just like you were hurt.
I misled you, and I admit it.
-I couldn't tell you
that I felt betrayed. -Why?
This is what I'm going for--
why?
Because I felt you were
trying to take me out next.
I'm just asking why you didn't
think I deserved the decency
of a, "Yes, H, you're going."
You could've done it
as we were walking out the door.
Code of silence after that--
you would've never had
to deal with me again.
I was very angry at you
scheming against me, so...
Again, hearsay.
PROBST: Helen, let him...
give him a chance to answer.
-All right.
-BRIAN: I was very angry at you,
and I wanted you to hear it
and feel it that night
at the jury.
That I was pissed at you
for going behind my back
after the relationship
that we did have,
that I thought I could trust you
as well,
and you did this to me.
You put together a plan
with Ted.
I heard it through Jan.
That pissed me off.
Yes, I did it out of anger,
and I admit it.
I completely admit
I was not honest with you.
Okay, and part B: Why should I
vote for you tonight?
(sighs)
For one mistake, uh, for...
for a, uh...
a truth that I admit,
an apology,
a, uh, uh...
period of 38, 37 days--
whatever we spent together--
I made one mistake with you.
I didn't tell you you were going
that night, and I apologize.
I take full responsibility
for that.
I felt that you
were powerful enough
to get me the following day.
That's how I felt,
and I apologize.
It's a little late now, but...
Clay, I'd sort of like you
to explain to me
why you think--
and I'd actually like three,
if you can come up with three--
reasons of how you
contributed to eight people
having to survive
on that island.
Uh, uh... I did stuff every day.
I did a little bit every day.
That's all I got to say.
I asked for three reasons
on what, on a daily basis...
CLAY: Well, you're not
gonna get three.
Helen, you don't understand,
because I can tell right now
there's no way in the world
to satisfy your answer.
So why try?
Okay. Okay.
Then I'm satisfied.
-Thanks, Helen.
-Thank you.
Jury, thank you
for your questions.
You now have
a big decision to make.
Who will walk away
with the title of sole Survivor?
Take a minute. Think about it.
PROBST:
Okay, jury.
Well, with everything
that has been said tonight,
I hope you were able to gather
the information you need
to make your decision.
The ball is now in your court.
One very big difference
in tonight's vote.
Tonight, the jury is voting
for somebody;
you're not voting against.
You're voting for who you think
deserves the title
of sole Survivor.
Clay and Brian, you want to see
your name on the ballot tonight.
Big decision.
You ready to make it?
It is time to vote.
Erin, you're up.
I'm actually voting
for Clay tonight.
I'm basing my vote on honesty,
and, Clay,
I feel that you have been
honest to everyone.
On the other hand,
I do not feel Brian has.
Good luck.
You know, this would have been
a very, very easy decision.
You messed up, Brian.
You messed up.
You assumed
that what we were writing
in the sand
was a scheme against you.
It wasn't.
It was a scheme
against Clay, not you.
You need to check yourself.
I know that there are
people out there
that remain committed
to their word.
My word was my bond.
And it's pitiful
that you didn't know that.
But that you are the lesser
of the two evils.
PENNY:
I think that,
uh, of the two that are left,
um, that Clay
really took the time
to get to know me as a person
in the 12 days I had with them,
and Brian never did.
Brian, what happened
between you and I
happened between you and I.
But in the context of the game,
I'm a bigger person
and can look beyond
what happened to me.
You deserve to win.
You had a work ethic
that was great
the entire time out here.
Several of the team challenges,
you almost
single-handedly won on your own,
so for that and your work ethic,
you get my vote tonight.
Good luck.
Hope you win.
I'll go tally the votes.
(sighs)
Been a long 39 days.
Comes down to this.
Jury, thank you for your very
spirited comments
and questions.
Here's what's at stake
for the winner:
new Chevy Trailblazer.
Not a bad truck and if Brian
knew how to spell "road trip,"
he'd already own one.
Also, the title
of sole Survivor.
And a little cash prize reward
that goes along with that
in the amount of
a million dollars.
There are seven votes.
It takes four to win.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Clay.
Brian.
One vote-- Clay,
one vote-- Brian.
Brian.
Clay.
Two votes-- Clay,
two votes-- Brian.
Three votes-- Clay,
two votes-- Brian.
Brian.
It's three votes-- Brian,
three votes-- Clay.
One vote left.
I'll read the last vote.
The winner of
Survivor: Thailand...
Brian.
(applause and cheering)
(Brian and Clay murmuring)
(applause and cheering continue)
