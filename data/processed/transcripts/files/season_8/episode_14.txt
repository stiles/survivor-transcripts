         PROBST: Previously on
Survivor:
As the last original Mogo Mogo
member Shii Ann was in
trouble...
 My best chance is
to call everyone on their game
and stir it up before I leave.
If you make it to the final
two with your current strategy,
I'll be shocked.
 PROBST: At the Reward
Challenge, a feast was on the
line.
Everything from a bowl of rice
to a full-on steak dinner with
all the fixings.
The winner will be in the charge
of that menu.
The game exposed the tribe's
true feelings.








Who does not deserve to be an
All-Star?
Alicia.
 That's a shot in the heart.
I'll get 'em all later.
 PROBST: Rupert was the last
one standing, earning the right
to divvy up the meal.
Back at camp, Alicia was upset
at being named an undeserving
All-Star.
 You know, it's never
fun to hear things about
yourself that aren't flattering.
 She's just being a big
baby about it.
 PROBST: At the reward dinner,
a clear pecking order was
exposed when Rupert gave the
best meals to himself, Rob,
Jenna and Amber.
 I'm sure the fifth,
sixth and seventh weren't too
happy, but, hey, what can you do
about that?
 PROBST: The next day Shii Ann
was still at risk despite her
scrambling.








 Yeah, we should talk
actually.
 I don't want to hear it.
There's a plan, Shii Ann, and
it's too late for anything to
change.
 PROBST: With her neck on the
line, Shii Ann came through for
herself at the Immunity
Challenge.
 Yes, take that!
I need this more than all of you
guys!
 Yeah, don't get too
cocky, though.
You've got to live with us, Shii
Ann.
 PROBST: Shii Ann's victory
meant all bets were off.
 Should have been
cutting deals with me, stupid
people.
Let me just say that again:
Stupid players.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Alicia, Rupert and Boston Rob
were all at risk, but in the
end, Alicia was voted out.
Alicia...
 Yes?
 PROBST: ...the tribe has
spoken.
Six are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

 It's so nice out.
♪ ♪
 It's so nice out.
 This is the first
beautiful day that I've
experienced here on Chaboga
Mogo and I've got to be honest.
It's not really brightening my
mood because the longer I stay
here, the more I realize I have
very few friends and now I'm
stuck in a tribe with five other
people who don't necessarily
trust me or even like me, and
it's very alienating.
It's really unpleasant out here.
 There you go.
Oh, my God-- nice, fresh milk.
 That's it?
 Yup.
I'm cooking, too.
I'm not having plantains today.
You want them, you can cook them
yourself.
I'm not eating them.
 I'm just really
tired of Jenna.
I cannot stand her.
The girl's a bitch, let's face
it, and, uh, she's bossier than
anybody else here on this tribe.
 I like eating off
the fire, so just take it, put
it on the log and then we'll eat
it.
 She drives me crazy.
I just wanna strangle her!
 Rupert, you're the man.
 I had a couple of
them that got off the spear
that were monsters, just
monsters.
I'd like to gut these guys.
We'll come back and get 'em,
clean 'em and eat 'em.
When I came out of the ocean, I
realized that nobody was going
to help me clean fish, but they
all want to eat the fish.
I'm feeling used and abused.
If somebody comes up and asks
which fish is theirs, I'll
probably tell them the one that
they caught and the one that
they cleaned.
 We usually get one
fish per person.
 If everybody gutted
one, they'd be all done.
 Rupert catches all
the fish, but Rupert catches all
the fish because he's a big man
who can handle those tides.
At 120 pounds, those tides would
literally crush me against the
He comes up and only brings one
fish up to cook for himself.
It was like a slap in the face.
Like next time when I'm hungry,
I'll cook only enough plantains
for me, because I'm doing that
job.
So, I wanted to tell him that I
thought that was a bad move.
 Everybody can go down
there and gut a fish and put it
on the fire.
 Yes.
You go out there and spend that
hour and a half fishing.
We can't physically do that.
If we...
 How many fish have you
cleaned?
 I've cleaned one.
 How many have they cleaned?
None.
 But you're talking
to someone who does help out.
I'm just saying we're doing the
other things that...
 But don't be mad at me
because I'm starving and come
back and put a fish on the fire.
 No, but my thing
is all of us, Rupert.
I know you're bigger.
We all have the same hunger
pangs.
 Everybody could have
gotten up and cleaned their own
damn fish.
 I was cooking.
 And everybody else?
What was everybody else doing?
 I know.
I'm not talking for everyone
else.
 My little Jenna had
the nerve to bitch at me about
putting one of my fish on the
grill.
She's just getting really a pain
in the ass, and I'm very sorry
that I have an alliance with
her.
Jenna just got mad at me for
throwing the fish on there and
saying that I was eating in
front of you guys.
 You know what?
You eat that fish.
Nobody is complaining.
You can eat all those fishes.
You don't have to share with us
at all.
I think that the dynamics are
changing a lot in this tribe,
and I wouldn't count me out yet
because she-devil has some
tricks up her sleeves, and I'll
be playing them.
 PROBST: Have a seat on the
bench.
All right.
Today's challenge is for reward.
And we thought this time maybe
we'll show you what the reward
is before we tell you about the
challenge.
Amber, here's your mom, Sheryl.
Come on in, Sheryl!
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Amber, get on that
mat.
 Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
 PROBST: All right, Sheryl.
Sheryl, just take a spot right
there behind the rope.
Rob, here's your brother, Mike.
 Yeah!
 You look good.
You grew a beard, too.
Losing weight.
 You too, huh?
 Yeah, on the South
Beach Diet.
 PROBST: Shii Ann, here's your
mom, Lily.
 Oh, mom.
Oh, I love you.
I miss you.
I'm sorry.
 Don't be sorry.
 This is my mom,
Lily.
 PROBST: How does she look,
Mom?
 LILY: Great.
 PROBST: Big Tom.
Get down here and say hello to
your son.
Get in here.
 There he is, Big Dad.
 Oh, Tommy boy!
What's happening?
 Mom said she's getting buff.
You'd better watch out.
 You working?
 No, no.
Hey, I wanted to go here anyhow.
( applause )
 PROBST: Jenna, here's your
brother, Ji.
 Ji!
How are the girls?
 They're great.
They're really fine.
Everyone's wonderful.
Everything's great.
Everyone's just thinking about
you.
 PROBST: Okay.
Is that everybody?
 No.
 Laura!
 PROBST: I'm kidding.
Rupert, come say hello to your
wife, Laura.
 JENNA M.: Oh!
 You just stay here
for a while.
 LAURA: Oh, my gosh.
 Oh, God.
 PROBST: Whoa, Rupert.
Whoa!
All right, Laura, I gotta break
it up.
Okay, let's get to the
We've put together a menu of
indigenous items from every
place we've been at on
Survivor.
Each round will feature a
different food item.
Each round we will lose one
person.
We'll start with six, we'll
work our way down to one.
For the winner, here's what you
get: an overnight-- loved one
and survivor.
We're down to eight days.
Eight days and six people, a
one-in-six shot at a million
bucks.
You could refill their tank in a
way that could be the difference
in this game.
A lot at stake.
And in case you haven't figured
it out by now, you ain't eating
nothing.
You guys are doing the eating.
 You got this, Ji.
 Oh, Mommy!
 Mind over matter.
 PROBST: I'll get the first
item.
 Mind over matter, guy.
Fish heads, very popular in
Malaysia.
Okay. Let me explain the rules.
Last person to finish is out.
So the first five move on.
You need to show me an empty
mouth.
Once I say okay, you're good.
You can take a drink of water
after that.
Everything's got to go down.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, eat.
 Go, Ji, the whole thing.
 PROBST: First five to get it
down move on.
Ji's got it all ready, all of
it in his mouth.
 Oh, my gosh.
My mom is not going
to be able to finish it.
 PROBST: Lily fighting it a
little bit. It's all right.
You're getting it down.
 Nice job, Ji.
Get that down.
Show him your empty mouth.
 PROBST: Ji is good.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Lily's good.
 Come on, Mike.
 Bo is good, Laura is good,
Coming down to the two on the
end, Mike and Sheryl.
 Come on.
Three, two, one, swallow it.
There it is.
 PROBST: Mike's good.
( applause )
 This way you don't
have to eat anything else.
 Spit it, Mike.
You can rinse and spit.
 PROBST: Sheryl, now comes the
hard part.
 I know.
 PROBST: You got to go.
No hugs good-bye.
 I won't. Love you.
Everyone sends their love.
 Love you, Mom.
 Love you.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: These are flying
cockroaches from right here in
Panama.
Ji, one for you and, Laura, a
nice plump cockroach for you.
Three, two, one, eat.
Ji's good.
Bo's good.
Laura, Lily and Mike.
Laura is good.
It's between Mike and Laura.
 Oh, I love you.
 PROBST: Mike is good.
Lily, I'm sorry, you're out.
 That's okay, Mommy.
You don't want to live here
anyway.
It's horrible.
 PROBST: Lily, it's time for
you to go.
 Mom, I love you.
Just tell everybody I love them
and I say hi.
 Love you.
 I'll be home soon.
 PROBST: Good-bye, Lily.
 Love you, Mommy. Bye-bye.
 PROBST: This is fafuru, the
worst-smelling stuff in the
world.
 Don't smell it, Mike.
Don't smell it.
 PROBST: Fish that's been
marinating in seawater in the
sun for three days.
Boston Rob remembers it well,
and to make it fun we'll do just
like we did in the Marquesas,
hands behind your back.
Here we go.
Three will move on.
Three, two, one, eat.
 Swallow it down, Mike.
Just swallow the whole thing
whole.
 PROBST: Bo's face says it
all.
 Swallow it, swallow, Mike.
 PROBST: Bo trying to keep it
down.
Bo's got it. You're good.
You're moving on.
 Ji, it's mind over matter.
He's got it down.
I can smell that burp.
Ji's in.
We're looking for one more.
It's Laura or Mike.
 Come on, Mike.
 PROBST: Mind over matter.
Swallow.
Swallow that last bit on your
tongue.
Mike's in.
 Yeah!
 I give you credit for yours.
 PROBST: Laura, it's time to
say good-bye.
 Okay.
 I'll be home soon.
 I know.
 I love you.
 PROBST: Next item...
tarantulas.
We featured these in Thailand.
They've been cooked, so they're
not harmful, and only two of
you will move on.
Make sure you show me that mouth
and make sure it's empty.
Hands on the table.
Three, two, one, eat.
 Go, Ji.
 PROBST: Bo not wasting any
time.
Shoves half of it down.
 That's it, Mike.
 PROBST: No, no, no, no.
Ji, I'm sorry, you took a
drink of water, you're out.
 No one said we couldn't.
 Not during the timing you
can't.
 PROBST: Yeah, I did say you
can't do it.
 Mm-mm.
 PROBST: Yeah, I did.
I clearly did.
Ji, you're out.
Bo and Mike you're moving on.
Ji, you might not remember,
but I clearly said, "Show me an
empty mouth.
Once I clear you, if it comes
"up, you're okay, and then you
can take a drink of water."
I know you don't like the
decision, but you're out.
It's time for you to go.
 Gotcha. I love you, baby.
 Love you, too. Bye.
 PROBST: It is down to Bo and
Mike.
Final round, wichity grubs from
Australia, and these are alive.
When you have an empty mouth,
completely empty, you show it to
me.
You ready to do this?
Three, two, one, eat.
Bo shoves the whole thing in his
mouth, it's down and he's in!
 Who's your daddy now?
 Whoa!
 Wow!
 PROBST: Wow!
 Wow!
 You're a sick kid.
 I didn't even see that.
 Neither did I.
 Hey, you get this far, you
might as well go after it.
 PROBST: I like that attitude.
Mike?
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: great effort.
It was nice having you out here.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: It is time for you to
go.
 Bring it home, baby.
 Thanks.
 Take care, guys.
 Nice to meet you, Mike.
 PROBST: Big Tom, join him out
there.
( grunts )
 Oh, me old son, me old son.
Me old boy, me old boy.
 Wicked, wicked.
 PROBST: Okay, here's the
deal.
We've taken Camp Chapera where
you used to live and we've
upgraded it a little bit,
Probably like you wish it had
been when you lived there.
You're going to spend the night
with pop, see what it's like
being a survivor, and hey,
if it's good for two, it's
better for four, right?
So Big Tom, choose one survivor,
we'll bring their loved one
back, and the four of you will
spend the night at Chapera.
 Rupert.
Rupert with Laura.
 I'm gonna pick aggravation
right there.
 PROBST: Boston Rob.
Mike, get on back here.
You're not done yet.
Boy, it is going to be a party
tonight with the four of you.
 Yeah!
 Whoo!
 Yeah!
 Whoo!
 Home again, home again!
 Home sweet home.
 Wow, look at the food.
 That's the best thing
I've tasted in the last 31 days.
 Here's to friends and
family.
 To friends and family.
 Ooh, baby.
It's good to drink beer with my
I wished it had been his
mother or my neighbor's
sister...
after I seen what a romantic
And I could have picked old
Rupert, but I couldn't have
stand to see him.
I've never seen a man slobber
over a woman like he did his
wife.
There was slobber hanging down
in his beard.
 What do you think
about everybody back at camp?
 Me?
 Yeah.
What do you think they're
doing right about now?
 Amber's getting high on life
or getting low on the ground.
Rupert's probably kissing and
hunting his harpoon.
Jenna is running that mouth like
a bell clapper and Shii Ann is
trying to make an alliance with
a bush because she's tried
everybody else.
( all chuckle )
 That's all we've got left.
 Man, you both on that swing?
Swing away, swing away.
 One, two, three.
 Oh!
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home. ♪
( drunken yelling )
 BOTH: Who's your daddy?
 We tore it up.
We partied hard all night long.
This is definitely what I needed
to get to the end, just to
finish my game, you know, a
little visit from home.
 Let's go for a walk on the
beach and we'll give you guys
some time, all right?
 All right.
 To be completely
honest with you, right now I'm
in an alliance with Amber first
and foremost.
 What I got to do now is
I got to get Rob and Amber to
keep me with them.
 I was, like, "Lex, do
me a favor, keep the girl and
I'll help you out on the reverse
side."
He goes, "All right." Sweet.
And the dumbass actually kept
her and then I snaked him.
 I think me and Rob might
be first and second.
That's all we said we was gonna
do.
 You know who my solid is?
It's Amber.
 Don't freakin' bank on it.
 I'm banked on it.
Dude, I'm telling you,
she won't switch.
I'm guaranteeing, Mike.
I guarantee.
I feel it that she's not gonna.
Big Tom, though...
 You've got to do what you got
to do.
 I don't trust him as
far as I can throw him.
 Welcome home.
far as I can throw him.
 Welcome home.
 Don't even tell us
how it was.
Did you eat pizza, Rob?
How you doing?
 Okay, how you doing?
 Today, Bo and Mike
came back from their little
adventure with Big Tom and Rob.
We need wood!
We need wood.
Let's get 'em to...
As soon as they came in, instead
of letting them sit down and
rest and enjoy their visit here,
we put them to work, got them
started, you know, helping us
out at camp.
 That boy has been on the
farm all his life.
When he gets up in the morning,
he knows what work is.
He's used to it.
 On the other hand, Rob
and his brother wouldn't help us
get the wood.
 They didn't get
diddley-squat.
 Just take a nice cozy
seat here.
 Go spear yourself a fish.
 You feeling pretty good?
 Yeah.
 This will probably
be the only time you'll be in
the ocean.
 Is the tide deep, or...?
 It's not bad.
I took Bo out spearfishing.
Big Tom wanted him to spearfish
badly, and I wasn't even going
to give Bo a spear.
 Okay.
 He won't kill you, Rupert.
 You know, I kind of
protect those spears, even
though I don't talk about it.
I protect those spears.
This is hard fishing, you know.
Bo wasn't the greatest swimmer.
He was using the spear to propel
himself more than to fish.
As we were fishing, I look at
Bo's spear, and the head of it
is gone.
I had my flashbacks to when Sean
lost his spear tip in Pearl
Island.
 A fine bunch of seamen.
What did he do?
 Lose the spear.
 Oh, my God, no.
 I'm not as worried
about it because I've got my
spear that is now going to be
considered mine.
They want to keep eating, they
will let me use the damn spear.
 What happened?
 I did it.
 You did it?
Bo is a bigger dumbass than his
dad.
I mean, Big Tom is pretty dumb,
but Bo is just-- he's out there,
too.
All right. You guys, you got to
police your zone and go...
 See you soon, all right?
 It's kind of like a dream to
come down here and see my
brother.
And remember, trust no one.
 All right.
 I think my brother
definitely knows what he's
doing, but you know,
he only has seven days to go
I believe, so you're going to
see a lot of sneaky activity
going on.
Have fun.
 All right, buddy.
Tell everybody I'm all set, all
right?
 I can say once you get to
a certain point, the pressure is
on you and you need to do some
things and my old man, he'll
fight to the end, as long as
he's walking, he'll fight so I
ain't got to worry about him.
 Who's your mama?
Berry picking bucket.
 Berries.
 Got a big-time
challenge.
 "If you think this
next challenge is buckets of
fun, you'll build your own fire,
then go for a run.
The first person with your
flame in the sky, you'll be safe
for the vote for someone else's
good-bye."
 Wow.
Well, we got some tree mail.
It's got a bucket with a hole in
it and a letter basically saying
that it's going to be buckets of
fun.
I know I'm still a huge target
and I know if I don't win
immunity, I may be the next to
go.
 PROBST: All right.
Let's get to today's immunity
challenge.
Shii Ann, give it up.
 I hate to part with it.
 PROBST: I know you do.
Once again, immunity back up for
grabs.
Today's immunity challenge is
going to test your ability to
make fire quickly and keep it
going.
Here's how it works.
You'll have two buckets.
One bucket you will use to build
fire.
The second bucket you will fill
with water.
As you fill that second bucket,
the weight of the water will
cause that bucket to drop.
That will cause the fire bucket
to lift.
Your goal: get that fire bucket
high enough to light a fuse
which will ignite the wok at the
top of your structure.
The first person to get their
fire to light the fuse wins
immunity.
Here's the rub.
The bucket that you're putting
water in has a hole in it, so
you're going to have to keep an
eye on your fire, making sure
you don't run out of matches
while you chase down more water.
Make sense?
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: we'll draw numbers
for your positions and we'll get
started.
For immunity, survivors ready?
Go!
Mariano takes his entire pile.
So does Amber.
 First step is getting that
fire going.
Rupert's already has got fire.
Shii Ann taking her time.
Rupert has fire and he's going
for water.
Big Tom has fire.
Big Tom going for the water.
Rupert and Big Tom filling up
their water buckets.
Mariano has fire.
Boston Rob, Rupert and Big Tom
filling their water buckets.
Jenna has fire.
Shii Ann with a good fire going,
building something that's going
to last.
Amber still trying to get her
fire going.
Boston Rob's bucket is moving.
This may do it.
His fire bucket is up.
It doesn't look like the fire is
going to be strong enough.
Don't touch it, let it fall.
Work that fire.
Boston Rob's fire went out.
He had enough water but he had
no flame once it went up.
That's why you guys got to keep
an eye on your fire, make sure
your fire is still going or
you're wasting your time.
All the water's drained out of
Big Tom's bucket.
Shii Ann's fire has gone out.
Everybody is starting over.
We're dead even once again.
Got to tend to your fire, build
a fire that's going to last.
Boston Rob is down to his last
match.
Make sure you light something
that's going to stay lit.
Wind playing a factor, got to
protect that flame.
 I'm out.
 PROBST: Boston Rob is out of
matches and has no fire, out of
the competition.
Boy, even with matches you guys
are having a tough time getting
fire.
 I'm out.
 PROBST: Amber is out of
matches.
Boston Rob and Amber out of the
competition.
You out of matches, Rupert?
 Yep.
 PROBST: Rupert's out of
matches.
Rupert out of the competition.
Big Tom has another flame.
Can he keep this one going?
 That's it, I'm out.
 PROBST: Jenna is out of
matches.
Down to Big Tom and Shii Ann and
Big Tom has a fire going.
 I'm out of patience.
 Where are the fire
gods when you need them?
 PROBST: Tom, really doing a
good job with the fire right
now.
Patience is paying off.
 Go get that water.
 PROBST: Shii Ann getting
close.
 Nice.
 PROBST: Each time you get a
little closer, Big Tom.
 Come on, Tom.
You got it.
 PROBST: Shii Ann has fire.
 Go, go, go.
 PROBST: Shii Ann's fire
getting stronger.
 Tom, a little momentum, not
quite enough.
This could be enough.
This one might do it.
Question is, is his fire going
to be strong enough?
Close, close, close, just shy.
That's it.
Big Tom!
Wins immunity.
 Way to go, Tom.
Very good.
 PROBST: Came down to two and
nobody gave up.
Big Tom pulled it out.
Turn around here, buddy.
Put this on.
 Thank you, man.
 PROBST: You got it?
 My first...
 PROBST: Nice job.
You are safe tonight at Tribal
Council.
The other five of you, not as
secure.
Somebody going home tonight.
You have the afternoon to think
about who that's going to be.
We'll see you all at Tribal
Council.
Go back to camp.
 ♪ I'm going to surprise
everybody.
♪ Here I come.
Here comes Big Tom.
♪ Here he comes.
I worried myself to death.
♪ I guess like everybody
I've worried myself to death...
I won immunity.
I finally got one.
I was proud of it.
See ya later.
 I find the dynamics
in the tribe very interesting at
this point, because now it's
down to six and if anybody wants
to take a power position,
they're going to have to use me
as a swing vote.
I mean, if you went to Rob and
talked to him about voting for
Jenna instead of me, maybe, but
that's pretty risky.
You need to talk to Amber.
 Well, I've said all
along, tonight I'd rather have
Jenna go.
I told you that.
 Well, here's the thing.
What I don't understand is, if
you want Jenna gone, why don't
you just go talk to Amber?
 You're putting me like
I'm a damn hero here.
I can't do nothing.
I'm like you.
Why don't you vote her off?
Me and you, we've got two votes.
 Yeah.
I'll vote her off.
 All right, well, there's two.
Now what are we going to do?
The only way she can save
herself is to get three other
people to vote off...
Well, I'd like to vote Jenna
off.
I'd want Jenna gone because Rob
and Amber pulls Jenna in, my
butt is on a highway to hell.
 Big Tom wants Jenna out.
 Yeah, he hates Jenna.
 He hates Jenna.
 I don't care who goes
as long as it's not me.
 I'm not going to
leave without trying.
 If you can get them
to vote Jenna off, it would be
beautiful.
 I'm feeling out a few people.
I'm trying to see if there's any
way I can get a tentative
alliance.
I mean, each one of them is
planning to take a knife out and
stab the other in the back.
So, I'll tell you who Big Tom
wants to vote out, and you
tell...
 Rupert.
 No.
 Jenna.
If you would be willing to do
that.
 He told me that he was
annoyed with her.
 He hates her.
 But unless he voted
with me, I can't do it.
 But would you do it?
 Shii Ann is talking
about getting out Jenna.
I don't know necessarily if I'm
gonna, you know, 100% go along
with it, but I'm gonna entertain
the idea, because this is the
All-Star.
It's, uh, hard-core.
You've got to play this game, I
think, more intense than you did
before.
 This looks like fun
time for girl talk.
 We're just talking
about the stuff I'm gonna eat.
 What are you gonna eat, Shii
Ann?
 Oh, my God, so much.
 Shii Ann's a scrambler.
I can't even deal with her.
I'm very, very annoyed with her.
Let's put it that way.
She opens her mouth, and I feel
like putting a gun in mine.
 No, but the only thing is,
I made a deal.
 I realize you've got to go
all the way, and if you can't
go all the way, you've got to go
all the way fighting.
And that is how I'm choosing to
play the game.
I can't wait to see what's gonna
happen.
I mean...
 It's going to be interesting.
 It's gonna be real
interesting, because, you know,
I know a lot of things about
this tribe, and it's all gonna
come out tonight at Tribal.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury...
Lex, Kathy and Alicia-- voted
out at the last Tribal Council.
All right, guys, let's talk a
little about roles.
Jenna, who's working?
Who isn't?
 Uh, Rupert's always
working, catching fish and
lugging some wood along with Big
Tom.
Um, I've been the only person to
go get plantains.
 PROBST: What's Amber doing?
 Uh, Amber helps
make the plantains.
She got water, and we cook.
 PROBST: How about Boston Rob?
What's he doing to keep a place
in this tribe?
 Boston Rob has been
trying to fish, but the majority
of the work is definitely
Rupert and... Big Tom combined.
 PROBST: Boston Rob, do you
agree with the assessment,
you're not really doing that
much?
 Uh, I don't think
that was the assessment, Jeff.
 I think I said...
 I probably haven't
been as productive.
I mean, I've fished almost as
much as Rupert, maybe not as
much, but I've tried as much.
I haven't been as productive as
getting them, but I'm out there
giving it a shot.
 PROBST: Amber, do you take
the past 33 days and look at the
actions of people and factor
that in to who really still is
trustworthy?
 I'm definitely
factoring in the actions that
people have made in the last
couple of days, let alone the
whole entire game.
People have changed a little bit
since day one.
I know for me, paranoia around
camp is... it's insane, it's
ridiculous, you can't escape it,
and... it's gotten to the point
where I'm annoyed with it.
 PROBST: Rupert, are you
noticing that the paranoia is
causing an annoyance to the
point that it's starting to
fracture relationships?
 The paranoia in our
tribe has at times started to
rip our tribe apart, rip
alliances apart, rip friends
apart.
 This is funny,
'cause you are the most paranoid
person.
( Jenna and Rupert talking )
 PROBST: Wait.
So what happened, Rupert?
 When I brought fish
home, and I looked at everybody
and said, "I'm taking one and
putting it on the fire right now
and I'm eating it, and I don't
give a damn what anybody else
does," it kind of freaked them
out a little bit.
 PROBST: Well, it's a fair
question, though.
If your role is to provide fish,
why should you be entitled to
the first one?
Somebody else is doing fire.
Do they get to sit next...
closer to the fire?
 And if somebody's
doing plantains, do they get to
eat all that they want and then
you cook yours later?
 That is why it
freaked everybody out--
because... I just stepped up and
said, "Mine."
 I wasn't freaked out.
I thought he deserved to eat a
fish before the challenge.
He went and caught it.
 You know, it's so
funny, this paranoia about the
food is mostly caused by one
person pointing it out, and that
person would be Jenna.
The person at camp who monitors
food, plantains, fish, coconut,
who makes it, who tells us when
we can make it, is Jenna.
 PROBST: So, Shii Ann, why are
you asking Jenna?
 You've never asked me.
 Jenna, stop monitoring what
what everyone is eating.
And if Rupert catches 20 fish
and he wants to eat them all,
let him.
Rupert, you deserve every single
one of those fish.
No one else here catches as many
fish or does as much work as
Rupert.
So I don't blame him for putting
that first fish on the fire.
I don't blame him if he wants to
eat all 20 fish, because, gosh
darn it, he earned it.
I mean, I'm just gonna call it
as see it.
The people who are remaining,
there's two power pairs, right?
There's Rupert and Jenna,
there's Rob and Amber, there's
no secret.
I keep wondering why they've
decided not to take Tom and I,
who are swing votes, to
eliminate one of the two of the
power pairs.
You know, take one power couple
and just cut it up.
 PROBST: you got everything
out?
 No, uh, what should I say?
No, I... See, I'm very torn
tonight about who I should cast
my vote for.
Whether or not I should cast a
vote for the person who I found
most annoying on the tribe,
or... if I should cast a vote
for the person who I think might
win this game, and point them
out.
 PROBST: When you say, by
making that vote, you'll expose
them?
 Well, I'm not... By making
that vote, I will be making a
statement.
You know, I'm just going to say
this.
Tonight I'm going to be casting
my vote for the person who I
think is playing the game the
best, for the person who I think
everyone else on the tribe
should be looking out for, and
for the person who I think, if
people don't watch, will win the
million dollars.
So maybe this will help shake it
up.
 PROBST: Is that your goal?
 Yeah. I love the
unpredictable.
I want to see what happens.
 PROBST: Big Tom, you have the
coveted immunity.
Formally, I will ask you if you
want to give it up.
 I don't...
That's the ignorantest thing
that's been said here tonight.
No-no offense to you, but, no, I
don't want to give it up.
 PROBST: Big Tom gonna hold on
to immunity.
You cannot vote for Big Tom.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to find out what
exactly is going on within this
tribe.
Boston Rob, you're up.
 It's time for you
Boston Rob, you're up.
 It's time for you
to go, and if you're wondering
if you can eat and how much you
can, because you think that I
monitor that, eat a lot, Shii
Ann, eat a lot.
 Amber, this vote is
Ann, eat a lot.
 Amber, this vote is
for you out of respect.
You are the mastermind right
now, so from one she-devil to
another, this is the vote I'm
casting tonight.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Shii Ann.
Shii Ann.
Two votes Shii Ann.
Amber.
Two votes Shii Ann, one vote
Amber.
Shii Ann.
Three votes Shii Ann, one vote
Amber.
The 13th person voted out of the
tribe...
Shii Ann.
That's enough-- you need to
bring me your torch.
Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken.
 Good luck, everyone.
 PROBST: It's time for you to
go.
Well, Shii Ann went out of this
game playing until the very end.
Obviously she wanted to stir
things up a little bit in camp.
Guess the next few days will
show us what, if any, impact her
words had.
Grab your torches.
Head on back to camp.

Survivor: With only five
all-stars left, paranoia reaches
new heights.
 I looked over, and my
heart sank because Rob was
standing right there.
 We got problems.
 PROBST: And the battle lines
are drawn.
 Did you or did you
not tell me we needed to get Rob
off?
 Rob is...
 Did you or did you not tell
me we needed to get Rob off?
 The she-devil did her best.
I really tried.
I played this game as hard as I
could.
I played with the best of the
best, but you know what?
I knew I was outnumbered, and I
knew they were gonna vote me
off, so I just wanted to warn
everyone, don't forget little
Amber with her big green eyes
and her beautiful smile.
Don't forget, she's playing for
a million dollars.
