( applause continues )
 PROBST: Welcome to the
Survivor All-Star Reunion.
We are live in Madison Square
Garden in New York City, and we
have all 18 all-stars, whether
they like it or not, back with
us.
And obviously there is a lot to
cover.
Let's start with what just
happened.
I want to ask you, Rob, did
Amber earn this?
Did she coattail it, or was she
a part of the decision-making?
 A little bit of both.
She definitely helped with all
the decisions.
I mean, from day one, she was








there with me, no matter what.
No matter what we decided to do,
she consulted.
We both decided together as a
team.
I give Amber all the credit in
the world.
She deserved 100% to win this.
( applause )
 PROBST: Amber, in the
beginning, there was no romance.
This was strategy.
So why Rob?
What were the factors that made
you think an alliance with him
made sense?
 Well, coming into this
game, I actually couldn't stand
him.
And I don't think he really
liked me either.
And I thought when he approached
me for an alliance, why not?
Take a guy that nobody would
expect me to align with because
I think it was obvious among
these guys, I didn't really even
like him.








And I thought, you know what,
Rob has a big mouth, he has a
temper.
If I stand beside him, he can
take all the bullets and
people won't even...
they'll
just forget about me, that I'm
actually with him, making these
decisions also.
 PROBST: By the way, we all
are noticing that ring, which
we're going to get to later.
Rob, now that's the big thing.
You had to be aware...
everybody saw...
That's all right, let's show the
rock, since we're there.
Hold your hand still, Amber.
Just hold tight.
( cheering and applause )
That is a beauty.
Wow!
Well, Rob, you did one thing
right this season anyway.
But that's the big thing I think
for people watching, is if
that's true what Amber said,
were you aware that you were the
bad cop the whole time and that
Amber has less enemies because
you're taking all the bullets?
 I was definitely.
And you know what, we kind of
planned that in the beginning.
I knew that in the end, people
were going to be gunning for me,
and the whole time, in order to
keep our alliance tight, she
would question me and say, you
know, what's going to happen,
this and that, we're making too
many people mad, and my whole
thinking was, if we get to the
final two, they're going to have
to vote for one of us, and I was
hoping that they would see that
I was the one kind of taking
those chances and taking the
shots to try to, you know, make
the decisions.
 PROBST: Rupert, why did you
guys not vote out...
( cheering and applause )
 Yeah!
Yeah!
Sorry.
Had to do that.
 PROBST: Hey, take it.
You've got a fashion statement.
 Yeah!
 PROBST: All right.
A lot of tie-dye in the
audience.
But let's get back to where you
screwed up.
Time after time, you could have
taken out Boston Rob.
At five, you could have taken
out Amber.
Nobody did.
The only thing I could surmise
is that everybody here thought
Rob was their ticket to the
final two.
Why else would you not do this?
 There was a lot of
talk about trying to get Rob or
Amber out.
There was...
there was talk
between the two of us, Big Tom
and I.
There was a lot of talk.
Nobody really stepped up.
 PROBST: Was there talk
between you two?
 Well, I talked to Big
Tom about trying to go against
Rob, and Big Tom stood behind
Rob.
 PROBST: What we don't...
I was going to say, what we
don't
know is what he told you could
have been him playing you, still
sticking up for Rob.
So why Amber and not Jenna?
Is it...
was it the love affair,
because it didn't seem like that
might have been the right choice
to make.
 In the end when it got down
to three?
 PROBST: Yes.
 There was no question in
my mind.
She was with me from day one.
Game aside, I didn't think I
could beat either of them, to
tell you the truth, going into
the final three.
I realized that I had pissed off
just about everybody on the
jury.
And I was hoping that, you know,
I might be able to, you know,
get a couple votes.
It was a lot closer than
I actually thought it was.
 PROBST: Let's...
I want to see who vote...
Let's finish up with who voted
for who.
Who here voted for Amber?
So just to see, of the four of
you, if it had been Jenna
instead, would anybody have
changed their vote?
Who would have still voted...?
You would have changed your
vote.
There you go.
So that would have been the
difference.
No, Jenna, you wouldn't have
won, Rob would have won.
The same people would have voted
for Rob.
 I don't know.
I think it depends also on the
final vote.
 PROBST: Well, that's true.
 Next time, we'll do it next
time.
 He's not so eloquent.
 Easy, easy.
 PROBST: One thing I want to
get to is, we all remember the
big moment when Rob went and
asked...
asked Lex to save Amber.
We don't need to see that tape
again.
We've seen it over and over.
You asked him for a favor.
He repaid...
he did that.
He and Kathy talked and they did
that.
Then when time came back for
payback, as Lex felt, it wasn't
there.
Lex, the question to you is: You
had done that same thing to
Colby, Ethan and Jerri.
( applause )
Fair enough, right?
You had said, this is business
and not friendship, over and
over, so what's the difference
here?
 The difference was that
no deal was ever struck between
Colby, Ethan and I.
We didn't make alliances.
We didn't make a deal.
There were no promises made.
( audience boos )
There can only be one winner in
Survivor.
We didn't make any deals.
And they, you know, frankly,
they didn't work into my plan.
 PROBST: Well, how is that...?
Hatch, you're shaking your head.
( Richard hollers )
 That's the point.
 PROBST: How is that different
from what Rob did to you?
 It isn't.
It's clearly not different.
 Yes, it is.
 It isn't.
 PROBST: Hold on...
 I saw Kathy shaking
her head when he said that
because it didn't work into his
plan doesn't mean that it isn't
part of the game.
I love these guys, but it's a
game.
( cheering )
It's a game.
And his speech at the end about
it not being-- it being more
than that is not true.
When you're playing chess, you
don't give away another thing
because they're your buddy.
You play to win.
In this game, the rules are a
little different, and you should
have known that going in.
 This ain't chess, Rich,
to be perfectly frank.
 Lex, it's a more
complicated game.
 PROBST: But I think Lex makes
a good point about this isn't
chess.
And that's...
We're going to take a break,
we're going to come back.
But that's what I want to talk
about is-- it isn't poker, but
it's the same philosophy, except
you're dealing with
relationships, and it's much
more personal.
We'll take a quick break, and
we'll come back and get back to
this.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
All-Star Reunion Show.
Before the break we were
talking about how complicated
this game is because you are
dealing with relationships.
If it's poker and you bluff
somebody, nobody gets mad, but
in this game-- bad analogy
maybe-- but the cards are
relationships, because
bluffing is part of this game,
no doubt.
Kathy, one of the things that
nobody's brought up is that in
this episode between Lex and
Boston Rob, you said, "It's
better than to have the wrath
of Boston Rob."
There had to be a little
strategy in this move is what
I'm trying to get at.
 What, to bring Amber over?
 PROBST: Yeah.
 Yeah.
No, I mean, we were talking.
Obviously, it wasn't a
decision that was made in 30
seconds, and we were thinking
that if we brought Amber over,
there were more options.
So hopefully the Rob-father,
the Rob-father might like the
favor, also the friend who
asked.
And I have to tell you-- I
know Rob, and he asked for
that favor outside the game.
And some day, some day, it
might be ten years from now,
but I think he's going to
admit it.
So, uh, no, I think there were
several reasons why we brought
over Amber, not just one.
 PROBST: Big Tom...
Hang on, Hatch.
 Yeah, you know what, Hatch?
Calm down.
 Even in her answer, Jeff...
 No.
 In her answer just
now, she agrees with me.
She's sitting there saying
there were other reasons that
we brought her over.
So if we didn't have the other
reasons, screw Boston Rob and
his request as a friend, we're
getting rid of Amber.
It's a game.
 PROBST: There were a lot of
arguments.
You can also argue that...
( cheering )
...a friend doesn't ask a
friend for favor in hoping to
get something back.
That's why the game is
complicated, because everybody
draws their line in so many
different places.
Big Tom, what happened between
you and Boston Rob?
This is a he said-she said.
Settle it.
There was a lot of stuff at
Tribal where Rob said to you,
"You know what I'm talking
about," and you said, "I don't
know what you're talking about."
 I still don't know
what he's talking about.
 PROBST: Rob, what are you
talking about?
 I'll do it right here, right
now.
Did you have an alliance with
Lex before the game even
started?
 Did I have an alliance...
 Did you have an
alliance with Lex before this
game even started?
 I had an alliance with Rob
and Amber.
The very first day.
 That wasn't the question,
though.
Did you have an alliance with
Lex before the game had even
started?
Yes or no?
 Don't yes-or-no me.
( laughing )
I've heard your mouth the
whole time we was out there.
 Right.
 And I'm sick of it.
And I just want to tell you
this-- Big Tom played the game
with Amber and Rob.
Rupert was the...
will tell
you right here, I never
wavered, never.
All the lies that were said
about this, that, everybody--
there's 18 of us here.
I don't know how many calls I
got, I don't know how many
calls you got, but I do know
on the very first day I gave a
handshake deal, with you and
you, to last through the game,
and I just said, "Rob, I'm
going to stick with it."
And you said so.
And even an hour before Tribal
Council, you made me shake
again.
 PROBST: Let me ask you...
 Rupert will say...
 Do you think I'm going
to take a chance?
Of course I make you shake
again.
Of course I will.
It's a game, Tom.
It's a game.
 PROBST: Yeah, Jerri?
 I've got to say something,
okay?
This whole thing is making me
so sick, okay?
( booing )
 You know what?
We got 2,000 armchair
survivors out there.
 No, I've got to say
something.
 PROBST: Say it.
 This show is a show
about entertainment.
This entertainment is coming
at a price.
What it has cost us?
Our friendships, our feelings,
our pain, our suffering.
 PROBST: Wait, Jerri...
 For entertainment.
 PROBST: Hang on.
( booing )
It's cost some of you
friendships...
 We all signed up for
it voluntarily.
 PROBST: Colby...
( booing )
Let's hear what these guys
have to say.
Donaldson...
( cheering )
Okay, take your two minutes
now.
Where's your take on this,
because...
( cheering )
You were very well-liked in
the first season and you were
a quick target in this one,
and you were betrayed.
You didn't see it coming.
Bitter?
Is that the way the game's
played?
Where do you draw your line?
 Well...
I didn't do very well, and
I've tried both times to play
this game with as much
integrity as I live my life,
but I will tell you this-- it
is one thing to know how to
play this game well, it is
something totally different to
be successful at it.
These two over here were
successful at playing this
game against the best.
( cheering )
 PROBST: Rudy...
give me a
take on this whole thing.
( cheering )
 I'm glad I got voted
off in the beginning, because
of all the backstabbing and
double-crossing that went on.
I'm glad I wasn't part of it.
And if I was, I mean, if I
stayed in, I think I would
have done something which
maybe I would have been sorry
for.
 PROBST: But there you go.
Even Rudy is saying, under the
right situation, I might have
betrayed, I might have back-
stabbed.
Is that what I read into that?
 Oh, no, no, no.
I ain't going to betray.
 PROBST: What are you saying/
then-- you might have done
something you'd be sorry for?
 I'm talking about
being around people that are
betraying each other, I might
have done something.
( laughing )
 PROBST: Shii Ann, what...
The complications of this
game, obviously...
( cheering )
...center around where we all
draw different lines.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: And you made a
comment at the final Tribal
Council, those in class houses
shouldn't throw stones.
 That's right.
( cheering )
I think it's a game, Jeff.
I think it is a game.
And, I'm sorry, Big Tom.
You know, we talked about
voting Boston Rob out, we did.
And I don't know if you were
lying to me, I don't know,
but we did, we talked about
it, to be fair.
We did talk about that
possibility, as I did with
almost everyone remaining in
the game in the final few days
that I was there.
So I don't know, you know, if
that means the alliances were
broken.
I don't want to say that for
you, but it's a game,
ultimately, and I feel like
everyone has betrayed someone
in this game.
 PROBST: Quick yes or no,
status of relationships.
Big Tom, Boston Rob, any
chance of reconciliation with
you guys?
 I had no trouble with
Rob during the game, as far
as...
You know, if he wanted to be
a lying, stealing cheat, let
let him be it.
 PROBST: Okay.
 But I draw the line
when he talked about my family.
My son...
( cheering )
I just want to tell you.
I did not, I did not do well
in the game.
I didn't win a vehicle.
I didn't win much money.
But what I have got is family,
and that's something he ain't
got that he wants.
 PROBST: Well...
 And...
but I'm just saying...
( cheering )
 PROBST: You know, let me ask
you, Big Tom.
Hang on, let me ask you
something.
And we're going long on this,
but it's worth talking about,
because that's what this game
is about.
 I signed on for the game.
 PROBST: Okay.
Understood.
But Bo became a part of the
game, so he's in the game.
He became a part of the game.
He competed in the challenge,
so he's in the game for that
moment.
Here's what I want to know--
is there any part of what was
going on between Boston Rob
and you, in terms of the names
you guys were calling each
other, that was in good fun or
was that really, purely mean-
spirited as far as you're
concerned?
 As far as I'm concerned, it
was mean- spirited, but I hope
it wasn't.
I hope that Boston Rob...
 That's crap, in my opinion,
all right?
Because I have a different
side of this story.
From day one, Tom, you called
me "pony" out there.
How many other people out here
can attest to that?
And you used it in a derogatory
way.
You said, "You're my pony and
I'm riding you all the way to
the end," every day.
And you know what?
I know how you are, and I
never really took it to heart.
And I joked around with you
and I called you dumb ass.
And, you know what?
( laughing )
One way or the other, it was
kind of like a term of
endearment.
And I'll tell you something...
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
I'm being completely serious.
And I'll tell you something,
Tom.
If...
If I offended Bo or if I
offended your family, then I
am truly sorry.
However, I do not apologize
for the way I played this
game, but if I did your family
wrong, then I apologize and
I'm sorry.
For that I apologize.
 Let me tell you this.
The way you played the game is
fine, but I want to say...
Wait a minute.
Just give me a minute.
I just want to say, Rob, it
takes a big man to say when
he's wrong, and I hope you're
saying you're wrong with my
son.
( cheering )
And I also want you to know
that I played it straight up.
 PROBST: All right.
We have to break.
When we come back, we're going
to find out about the rock and
all that stuff.
We'll be right back.
 To be able to spend 39
days now with a person who
always makes you happy, always
makes you feel completely safe
in any situation, always makes
you feel important and proud of
yourself is just amazing.
( applause )
 PROBST: Welcome back to
Survivor All-Star Reunion show.
A couple things: one, this
tease, this big reveal is still
coming.
But more importantly, if there
was any question about the
authenticity of this show and
the feelings that people have,
if you can give us a big shot of
all 18, we are now down to 17
because Jerri left during the
break.
( applause )
That's why she left.
She made a comment and she got a
very large response from the
audience, and she immediately...
What, Rich?
 Jeff, listen, it's a tough
thing.
Sometimes when we're playing the
game, people think of us as
characters, and it's...
unless
you have a really, really tough
skin, like me, it can get to
you.
And Jerri's a great girl.
She's a super person.
( applause )
She was just a little upset.
It's tough.
5,000 people, it's tough.
 PROBST: Jerri brought into
this game with her the feeling
people had from the second
season, which made her an
All-Star.
She was a great "character."
It's easy to forget she's a real
person.
Okay.
Sadly, we have to keep moving in
this show because there's a lot
to get to.
I wish Jerri hadn't left, but
she knows we still care about
her and like her, so let's keep
going.
( applause )
I got to ask you guys, because
there was...
the odd thing is,
there was all this speculation,
people kept coming up to me
saying, "The big surprise--
I know what it is.
These guys are going to get
married."
And I said, "No, it's not.
It's something that has to do
with you guys."
You didn't...
you looked like
you almost knew.
Did you know?
( chuckles )
 I didn't necessarily know.
It's something we've talked
about.
 PROBST: Wait, did you go to
her and say, "I'm gonna ask you
to marry me?"
 She had no idea that I
was gonna do it live on the
show tonight.
 PROBST: Okay.
 I went and talked to her
mom and her dad this morning, at
8:00 this morning, in their
hotel room.
 PROBST: Give us a shot of Mom
and Dad in the second row there.
There's Cheryl and Valentine.
Hey, guys, give me a thumbs-up
if this is all good.
Mom and Dad, give me a thumbs-
up.
Is this is an okay thing?
 Absolutely.
( applause )
 PROBST: And right in front of
them, there's Robert and Linda.
Mr.
Mariano, how do you feel...?
You got a nice daughter-in-law
coming here.
 We think it's wonderful.
 PROBST: Fantastic.
All right.
( applause )
At any point in the game, did
you two suspect that the other
might be playing you?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
( laughing )
 PROBST: When did it become...
okay, so we've covered that
initially this was strategy.
For you, Amber, when did it
change?
Was there a defining moment when
you looked at him and said,
"Wow, you know, I think I've got
feelings for this guy?"
 Um...
yeah, there was
definitely a defining moment.
Like I've said again and again,
in the beginning it was
strategy.
I knew I was going to flirt
with him.
I was going to flirt with
everybody out there to get me to
the end.
But the whole shelter-building
thing came, he started looking
pretty hot, it became more
easier...
you know, easier to
flirt with him.
But I didn't really realize
there were feelings there until
we got separated and I was on
the Chapera still and he got
sent to Mogo Mogo and I
realized, "Wow, I actually miss
him.
There really is something
there."
That's when it got real.
 PROBST: I'm still reeling
from the fact that you guys just
got engaged.
You really did get engaged.
Rob, it seemed to me, I thought
you were smitten within Amber
pretty early on.
I was thinking you were into it
early.
 Oh, definitely.
I mean, look at her.
Just the initial attraction
alone, the physical attraction
is enough to drive anybody
crazy.
But, uh...
it's funny, she said
earlier that she really didn't
care for me when we first went
out there.
And I'll tell you truth, when I
first went out there, I thought
she was a little snob.
But, uh, you know, this game, it
does funny things to you, and
you see people at their lowest
low and their highest high.
And you see them at their worst
and at their best.
And I saw something in Amber
that I've never seen in anybody
else before in my entire life.
 PROBST: Amber...
( applause )
tell us what you see in Boston
Rob that a lot of people at home
are going, "I don't get this."
( audience laughing )
 Um...
you know what,
nobody has ever made me feel as
secure as he makes me feel, and
I just...
it's an amazing feeling.
He made me feel secure out there
and he makes me feel secure
today in everything, in my life,
in every decision that I've ever
made, in everything that I do, I
feel...
no, I know that I have
one person behind me no matter
what and I love that and that's
why I love him.
And he's just wonderful.
 PROBST: We're all very happy
for you guys.
At least something good came out
of this.
When we come back, one survivor
is going to award another
survivor a new car.
It's a Chevy Equinox.
It's a cool ride.
Plus some great updates.
We'll find out what these guys
have been up to.
Look at this:
Canton, Massachusetts.
This is Aunt Mary Lisa and Uncle
Dennis hosting a party for
Boston Rob, all his friends down
in Boston.
Be right back.
 I've worked myself to death.
I can't save everybody.
I've worked myself to death.
I can't save everybody.
See you later.
( applause )
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor All-Star Reunion show.
No, the car giveaway is not the
big twist.
That is still to come.
But we are going to do that.
I just want to go through and
get some quick updates from
people.
Jenna, we've had to make a lot
of hard turns tonight.
One of the most tragic things
that has happened in eight
seasons of Survivor happened to
you this season when you lost
your mom.
How is the rest of the family
doing now?
 They're okay.
I mean, I've got a good family.
I've got a good group of
friends, including a lot of
people here, so she's still
here, she's just here now,
instead of in the audience like
she was last year.
( applause )
 PROBST: And there is some
good news in your life.
 There's always good news.
 PROBST: This guy in front of
you.
 I guess.
 PROBST: This is another
Survivor relationship--
( audience cheering )
Jenna and Ethan.
 Pre-All-Star a little bit.
We were friends, but, yeah,
there's a lot more to our
relationship than just Survivor.
Survivor is just another thing
on our resumes.
Our relationship has a lot more
substance.
 PROBST: Sue Hawk...
I get
what you're saying.
Sue Hawk, stand up.
Look at this new Sue Hawk.
( applause )
You had a lot of work done.
Tell us.
Extra TV was kind enough
to come to me and ask me if I
wanted an extreme makeover for
their new show, Mirror, Mirror.
And I went all over it.
 PROBST: So what all did you
do?
 We'd be here forever.
But keep an eye on that.
We'll update you.
That's coming up.
 PROBST: Chest?
 Obvious.
 PROBST: Eyes?
 Oh, yeah.
 PROBST: Lipo?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Hair?
 Oh, my God, have you
been checking into it for
yourself?
There's a lot.
 PROBST: You look fantastic.
 Yeah.
And then, uh...
yeah, so that's
coming up.
Talking about relationships...
 PROBST: Yes.
 Tomorrow, Monday, is my
17th anniversary with my
husband.
 PROBST: Congratulations.
Speaking of which, Rupert,
I think one of the reasons
people like you, and there are
probably many, but is the
relationship that we saw with
your wife, Laura.
You did back-to-back Survivors.
Did this hurt the relationship
at all or did it strengthen it?
 That was very hard
being away from my wife so long.
Right there, God, I...
I did not
want to let her go.
I wanted her to stay.
 Yeah, Rupert!
( applause )
 PROBST: Still strong?
 I just want to say
that is the most beautiful woman
out there.
And I am the luckiest man in the
world to have such a wonderful
wife.
 PROBST: Right next to you, if
I can believe what I've read,
Jenna Lewis, did you get married
this weekend, this past weekend?
 I did.
I did get married last weekend.
 PROBST: This is the nuttiest
reunion show ever.
 Unfortunately I didn't get to
do it on national TV, but, you
know...
 PROBST: Tina is in shock.
I don't think a lot of you guys
knew, did you?
 ...Web site.
 PROBST: Word was spreading.
 Jeez, Web site?
 PROBST: Well,
congratulations.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: You look fantastic.
 Thank you.
I haven't had any work.
So, Extra, you can come to me
next.
I'm just kidding.
 PROBST: And finally, there is
one last update I heard about,
which is even Richard Hatch
found love, thanks to Survivor.
 Absolutely.
 PROBST: After you were voted
off, we take the people who've
been voted off and put them
somewhere on a cruise or on
a journey or something so we can
keep them out of trouble, and
you actually met somebody.
 They sent me to
Argentina, I walked into the
hotel; he was behind the desk.
We haven't been apart since.
( applause )
Right over there.
 PROBST: Okay.
You get a little something for
everybody on this show.
Okay.
Here's the deal, because for the
first time ever...
up until this
season, anybody who had won a
car had never won the game.
Well, Rob won the car.
Arguably, Amber didn't win a
car; she was rewarded with a
car.
But nonetheless, you both have
cars, so Chevy wanted to do
something different.
Amber, because you're the
winner, you're going to give...
there's a little shot of it
there, a Chevy Equinox, it's an
all-sport SUV, very nice ride...
you're going to give this to one
of these other 16.
You cannot give it to Rob
because he already has one.
I feel like Bob Barker.
Ten seconds right now.
You're giving this car away.
 ( chanting ): Rupert, Rupert,
Rupert!
 PROBST: They're consulting,
just like in the show.
 Whatever you want.
Don't listen to them.
You make up your own mind.
 PROBST: All right, Amber,
who's getting the car?
Who's getting the SUV?
 Who was the deciding vote?
 I'm going to give it to Shii
Ann.
 PROBST: Shii Ann.
Why Shii Ann?
( applause )
Congratulations.
All right, sit down.
Amber, quickly, why Shii Ann?
 Shii Ann was the deciding
vote.
She gave me the million bucks.
 PROBST: So you're paying back
Shii Ann for her vote.
 She was that swing
vote and she gave it to me.
 PROBST: All right, finally.
We've been teasing you with it
night after night and all night
tonight.
The final Survivor All-Star
twist is next.
I promise.
Be right back.
( applause )
 PROBST: All right.
( applause )
 PROBST: All right.
We've been teasing you with this
for a long time, and we're going
to get to this surprise.
I just want to say one thing:
This is obviously an emotional
season, an emotional final
Tribal, an emotional night.
We've had friendships that
hopefully will heal.
Kathy said it in Tribal, she
believes in this, maybe you do,
maybe you don't, you guys shook
hands.
We have a couple that's been
engaged...
Congratulations, by the way.
Jerri, we hope is doing all
right.
So thank you guys for...
( audience chuckling )
I'm not being light.
I'm know I'm rushing through
this, but these are real people,
and we get that.
So thanks for a really good
season of Survivor.
( applause )
So now to reward you guys.
All right, audience, you've been
there with us for eight seasons.
You've watched over 120 Tribal
Councils, and you have never
participated in a single one.
You've never had a vote.
Well, now you do.
And it is a very valuable vote
indeed.
Here's the deal: CBS is putting
up a second million-dollar
prize.
And this time, the audience is
going to decide who gets the
money.
It is going to be awarded to one
of these 18 all-stars and you
guys are the jury.
It's not happening tonight.
You can vote for any one of the
all-stars.
You can vote for any reason you
think appropriate.
Here's how you do it.
Vote now on your wireless phone
by text messaging the name of
the Survivor all-star...
You thought it was going to
happen tonight?
...that you want to win.
You dial 26161 or you can log on
to CBS.
com.
Text voting is open to Cingular
and most other wireless carrier
customers.
The polls will be open until
midnight on Wednesday.
Then on this Thursday we're
back.
It's another live show in New
York City.
We're going to give the million
dollar prize to one of the 18
here.
So you have quite a few days to
vote.
There are two ways to vote: text
messaging the name of the
Survivor all-star you want to
By the way, these guys are all
getting excited and Jenna is
talking like normal.
After the show, everybody here
will get a chance to make their
case on video.
You can hear their case, decide
who you want to vote for.
So it's next Thursday night.
It is your show.
Your vote will make one of these
guys a millionaire.
We will also announce where
Survivor is going next.
By the way, tonight, if you want
to own a piece of Survivor: All-
Stars, go to eBay.
com.
You can bid on everything from
this season, all kinds of props,
and it benefits our good
friends, the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
And, finally, if we didn't have
enough to get through on this,
if you want to be on the show,
we're casting for Survivor 10
at CBS.
com.
Tomorrow morning we will give
Amber a check for a million
dollars on The Early Show.
Thank you for being with us.
Good night.
