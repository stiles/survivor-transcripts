         JEFF PROBST: Previously on
Survivor.
Rupert and Jenna were at odds
over the workload.
 We all have the same
hunger pains.
 Everybody could have
got up and cleaned their own
damned fish and put it in the
fire.
 I was cooking.
 She's just a pain in
the ass, and I'm very sorry that
I have an alliance with her.
 PROBST: At the Reward
Challenge, the All-Stars got a
unexpected visit from their
loved ones.
( laughing )
Rupert, come say hello to your
wife, Laura.








 PROBST: And the loved ones
had to endure a variety of gross
foods for a night with family.
Bo's face says it all.
Tom's son Bo won the
competition.
 PROBST: It's down and he's
in.
 Here we go, here we go,
here we go.
 PROBST: So, Big Tom, choose
one survivor.
We'll bring their loved one
back, and the four of you will
spend the night at Chapera.
 PROBST: I'm going to pick
aggravation right there.
 PROBST: Tom chose Rob and his
brother Mike for a night to join
them for a night of beer and
pizza.
That night, the boys lived it
up.
 Who's your daddy?
 Who's your daddy?
 PROBST: The next morning back
at Chaboga Mogo, Rob and Amber's
lazy work ethic irritated even








their closest allies.
 Neither one of them
do a damn thing around here.
 PROBST: After Tom and Rob
said good-bye to Bo and Mike,
the All-Stars struggled at the
Immunity Challenge.
 PROBST: Boston Rob is out of
the competition.
With her neck on the line, Shii
Ann played a close game, but it
was Tom who came away with
immunity.
Tom! Wins immunity!
Before Tribal Council, Shii Ann
tried to sway the others.
 I'm not going to
leave without trying.
 If you can get them
to vote Jenna off, it would be
beautiful.
 I wouldn't count me out yet
because she-devil has
some tricks up her sleeves.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
despite her scrambling to save
herself, Shii Ann, the last
original Mogo Mogo member, was
the next to go...
Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken.
...making her the fourth member
of the jury.
Only five are left.
Tonight one more will go.

(theme song playing)
 The weather is terrible and
and it rains every day.
The shelter is pitiful and it
leaks every night.
Every one of us stink like
rotten dogs.
The challenges are going to
become more mental, more
physical, more stressful.
Camp life is hard, and as it
gets down to the last few days,
it's getting harder every day.
 I mean, at this point,
you get so fed up of being
with the people that you're
with,
you don't want to hear their
stories anymore.
You're just drained.
You're tired, you're cranky,
you're hungry.
You're not sleeping at night,
and it's just like, "Shut up.
Don't talk to me."
 But you got to know...
they invited me... and I went
down to eat with them, but I
didn't play.
Take a little on the side.
 There was a brief
time where I actually understood
a couple words Big Tom said, but
for the most part, the entire
time out here, I haven't
understood him at all.
He's not getting enough water
or something because he's just
mumbling to himself.
( Tom mumbling )
 Yeah.
He makes these unintelligible
noises.
Nobody understands what he's
saying.
 Nice!
The mother lode.
 Jenna and I were
gathering our coconuts and
sitting down, celebrating
cracking open green coconuts
and toasting to our victory over
the darn coconut trees.
 Okay. Here's what I
want to talk to you about.
You or I have to win immunity
next.
 Yes.
 When we do, we vote
Boston Rob, okay?
 Right, we vote, we
vote Boston Rob, only because...
When Jenna said, "and we have to
beat Rob in immunity," I looked
over and my heart sank because
Rob was standing right there.
 Perfect.
 We got to beat, we got to
beat Big Tom.
 He's annoying the crap out of
us.
 It's no big deal.
 What?
 It's no big deal.
 It was a little scary
situation.
Jenna already is full of
paranoia and I don't need Rob to
be full of paranoia.
Paranoia will destroy ya.
 Guess what.
 What?
 We got problems,
big problems.
 Okay.
 I just walked up on,
uh, Jenna and Rupert and they
have no intention of going to
the Final Four with us at all.
 Did you confront them
about it?
 No.
 Are you going to?
 No.
 I was under the
assumption that the game would
be easier in the end because I
knew we had our strategy set in
the beginning and that we
weren't really going to have to
worry too much about it in the
end, but I was completely wrong.
So what do you think they want
to get rid of next?
 Me.
Definitely.
 Of course I don't
blame him-- he's worried.
You know, if he is the target,
he's the next one to go, but,
then I'm sure I'll be soon
after, but it's of our control
right now.
 I want it, too.
 PROBST: How we doing?
 Good.
 Good.
 PROBST: Yeah?
 Happy to be here.
 PROBST: Ready to hear about
today's challenge?
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: All right.
Today's Reward Challenge will
give you a second chance at some
of your favorite elements from
previous Survivor challenges.
It is elimination-based, so we
will start with five.
In the first round, you'll make
your way across a balance beam.
First four to finish move on.
You'll navigate your way under
the belly crawl, complete the
slide puzzle, remove the knife,
chop the rope, raise the flag.
The first three to finish move
on to the next round.
Stompede: using a plank
launching three items up into
the air and into your basket.
First two to finish move to the
final round.
For the final round you'll go up
the rope ladder, make your way
across the rope bridge, race
down the flying fox, grab a key
and come back to the finish.
First person across the finish
wins.
I think you know what you're
playing for.
 Yeah, nice ride.
 PROBST: You're looking at it.
GM Chevrolet Colorado truck.
Not a one of you wouldn't look
good in it.
You'll put it to good use right
away.
We'll leave her, go down to the
beach, drive along the beach to
where we have assembled the
Survivor drive-in movie t
heater.
 Oh!
 A movie.
 PROBST: Huge screen to watch
a movie, plus refreshments, of
course.
You have candy and chocolate,
hot dogs, drinks, popcorn, some
pillows, blankets.
If you want to take the top off
the back end of your truck and
sit in the bed, you can watch it
under the rain or you can get
inside if you want.
 Wow.
 PROBST: Worth playing for?
 Yes.
 Yeah, it's well worth it.
 PROBST: All right, we'll draw
numbers.
Wait for my go.
 Cool.
 PROBST: A little bit of
Survivor trivia.
In the first seven seasons, the
person who has won the car has
never won Survivor.
Think about that as you compete
in the first round.
First four over the balance beam
move on.
Survivors ready... go!
Mariano off to a slight lead.
Rupert down and back to the
start.
Got to get across the rope.
Mariano's across.
Jenna, Big Tom are close.
Jenna's across, Big Tom's
across, Amber's across.
Rupert, you're out.
All right, for this round, you
must make your way under the
belly crawl, complete the slide
puzzle and raise the flag.
First three from this round move
on.
Survivors ready. Go!
Jenna and Boston Rob moving
through quickly, Big Tom and
Amber moving through quickly.
It's going to be tight.
Boston Rob's out.
Jenna, Big Tom, Amber out.
Everybody got mud on their face.
You're moving pieces around
until you can get the knife
through the slot at the bottom.
Boston Rob has his.
Chopping and it's up.
Boston Rob's moved on.
Keep sliding those pieces,
trying to get the knife out at
the bottom slot.
Amber has hers out.
Amber's moved on.
We're looking for one more
person.
It's going to be Jenna or Big
Tom to join 'em.
Who can complete the puzzle
first?
Tom making some progress.
Tom getting some momentum.
Thinks he might be on to
something.
Big Tom has his out.
Chop that rope.
Big Tom moving on to the next
round.
All right, for this round you're
looking to launch all three
items, one at a time, up into
the air and into your basket.
First two to finish move on to
the final round.
Survivors ready.
Go.
 Come on, Amber.
Come on, Rob.
Come on, Big Tom.
 PROBST: Planks are
adjustable.
Amber.
 Nice.
 PROBST: First one in.
 Nice, Amber.
 PROBST: Boston Rob just
overshoots it.
Amber with her second one in.
Nothing but net.
 Do it, Amber.
 PROBST: Amber out to an early
lead.
Boston Rob still misses with his
first one.
Amber, three in a row.
Amber's moved on to the final
round.
We're now down to Big Tom and
Boston Rob.
Boston Rob has his first one,
Big Tom misses to the right.
 Come on, Big Tom, keep
going.
 PROBST: Boston Rob has his
second one in.
Big Tom misses again to the
right.
Boston Rob looking for his third
item.
This will move him into the
final.
Adjusting his plank...
Just like that, Boston Rob and
Amber move on to the final
round.
 Yeah!
 PROBST: It comes down to
this, Boston Rob and Amber,
you'll make your way up the rope
ladder, across the rope bridge,
down the flying fox, grab a key
and back to the finish.
The first one to finish wins the
Chevy Colorado truck.
With only six days left, break
from the game, a little food in
your belly, could have a big
impact.
Here we go.
Survivors ready.
Go!
Boston Rob with a slight lead up
the ladder.
Boston Rob almost takes a
tumble.
Amber right behind.
Boston Rob, no trouble at all.
Show me those keys.
Congratulations.
You got yourself a truck, man.
 Whoa!
 Good job.
 I knew he had it.
 PROBST: Nice job.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Ever had a new truck
before?
 First one.
 PROBST: Really?
 Thank you very much.
 PROBST: All right, so here's
the deal.
We're going to get in this
truck, we're gonna drive down
the beach, we're gonna head over
to the Survivor outdoor drive-in
movie theater.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Not going to be any
fun by yourself.
One person coming with you.
 Got to be Amber.
 PROBST: Really.
 Second place, and, uh...
she's been with me from day one.
 PROBST: So it's Amber and
Boston Rob at the drive-in
movie.
 Sounds good, Jeff.
 PROBST: Let's get in.
You guys heading on back.
 Have a good night.
 Y'all have a good night.
 PROBST: Boston Rob, you're
driving.
Amber, hop in back, I'll take
shotgun.
 I'm gonna get your
new truck all dirty.
 That's okay.
 This is nice.
 PROBST: Let's hit it.
 You know, anybody that's
won a car during Survivor has
never actually won Survivor.
Well, that wasn't going to
discourage me from winning.
I'll tell you right now, it was
worth it.
 Nicely done.
Mariano, what up?
This is a guy who knows his way
around a truck.
Now that no one's around, nice
to have a rig?
 Oh, my God, this is
beautiful.
You can't really show the true
emotion, you know, with
everybody else standing there
going, "You just won a new
truck."
 PROBST: Right.
So, here's the deal: got a snack
bar over here.
It's full of juices, popcorn.
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Hot dogs, everything
you guys need.
Huge screen.
You'll be watching Lord of the
Flies, the movie that sort of
inspired this show.
And I think that's about it.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: All right, guys.
Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, one more thing.
There's one more thing.
Uh, come with me.
One of the added benefits of
being selected by Boston Rob...
something for you, Amber.
 Oh, my God.
 Shut up!
Are you serious?!
( screams )
 PROBST: Amber, right here.
 No!
 PROBST: Another new car.
Only this one's yours.
 Thank you.
No!
 PROBST: Malibu Max, all
yours.
 What goes around comes
around, huh?
 PROBST: You look good in
there, Amber.
So if you get tired of watching
it in the Colorado, you move
into the Malibu Max and watch
for a while.
 This is too much right now.
 You just gave me a
car, do you realize that?
 You earned it, you
earned it.
 AMBER ( screams ): Whoo!
 PROBST: Right on.
 Yes!
 No way.
 PROBST: Let's get the movie.
( honks horn )
 I love it.
I love it.
 What's behind door
number three, Jeff?
 Yeah!
Oh, my God!
I am so pumped.
 PROBST: Let's go watch a
movie.
 All right.
 Time alone with Amber
was unbelievable.
For the first time, I didn't
have to think about the game at
all.
 I'd be miserable.
I can't really complain about
my first date with Rob.
You know, I was thinking about
after the game, you know, I
wonder what we'll do-- probably
go out to dinner, you know,
maybe go to the movies,
maybe he'll bring me flowers,
who knows?
But on our first date, yeah, we
did go to the movies, we did get
some popcorn, and he gave me a
car instead of flowers.
Let's see, flowers, a car,
flowers, a car, I'll take the
car.
We're going to eat at least two
more hot dogs time each.
Two or three
 Amber's definitely
special to me, a lot more
special than when we started
this adventure.
But, I mean, still, you can't
lose sight of the fact that
you're playing a game for a
million dollars.
I'm not going to forfeit the
million to anybody, including
her.
 I would love it if
they brought us back some food.
 I don't believe that.
 Every time I've won,
I've brought back pocketfuls of
food, piece of candy or
something would be nice.
 When you come back
from reward challenges, you
always feel guilty.
So to come back from another
reward challenge with a car,
it was pretty rough.
Hi.
 Hey.
How was the movie?
 Brought some stuff
back for you.
 Some candy.
 It was good.
 Beautiful.
 We want to tell you
all about it... well, if you
want to hear.
If you don't want to hear...
I had the choice whether or not
to tell people that I had won
the car, but I felt that holding
that back from them just wasn't
me.
We were getting ready to start
the movie and Jeff goes, "Oh,
wait, hold on, hold on, I
totally forgot, we have one
more thing."
And me and Rob are like "What?"
He goes, "One of the luxuries of
being chosen as the one person
to go on the drive-in date is
that they also get something,
too."
And we start walking back and
there's another car.
And they gave me a car.
 Man.
 Unbelievable, right?
 Very, very cool.
 Huh?
 I was flipping out.
 I was completely
shocked.
 We were shocked.
I'm still freaking out about it.
Like, every five minutes I go,
"Rob, you gave me a car."
 They won a car
apiece.
They brought back pockets full
of candy, and split them up into
five piles.
They took their share after
eating dogs and candy.
"I saved my candy."
Well, it's easy to save your
damn candy when you've got a
belly full... and a new car!
 How old are you, are you 18?
 I'm a good Catholic girl.
 Good Catholic girls
are pretty sexy.
 I know.
Take your hat off.
 If there is a
Survivor hex that keeps the car
winners from winning the game, I
would love that.
That would be my little justice.
And I win the million.
 Oh, so nice.
 If we want to have a
 Oh, so nice.
 If we want to have a
fire at all, we're going to have
to have some wood.
After a while, I'll go get us
some fish.
This is the first night with not
very much sleep and very little
help.
It makes me crazy to watch Rob
and Amber sit on their butts,
and then when challenge comes
up, they have amazing amounts of
energy.
 Where's Rup?
Do you see him out there?
 He was standing on the
rock, so I actually saw him...
 I think he and Tom were
up there.
 You know, if you don't win
immunity, you're fifth out.
 Well, they're going to do
something.
 If you win immunity,
are you going to put your only
worker out of this tribe or are
you going to band with me and
put Rob out?
Break that damn couple and break
that couple apart.
 You know, everybody on
the tribe has tried to change my
mind for the last two or three
weeks.
I've entertained the thought,
you know, that I also am playing
the game, you know.
I want to win, too.
I mean, I'm not going to lay
dead and let everybody just run
over me, which I have been most
of the game.
If we don't get Rob off, he's
won.
 If we don't get Rob
off, what?
 He's won.
 He's won?
If I get Tom in with Jenna and
I, we three would be the power
in this five and put Rob and
Amber out of this game.
I think I'm going to go try to
get us a couple of fish early.
Are you hungry?
No?
 At this point, there's
no guarantee that Tom's going
to stay loyal.
I can't trust anybody, so pretty
much what I did was I instigated
Big Tom to start a fight with
Rupert.
Maybe he's trying to play
both sides or something, but
he keeps telling that you keep
saying you want to vote me out.
 I won't change alliance.
 Huh?
 I won't change alliance.
Well, how could I?
 I don't know.
 It would be stupid of me.
Think-- why, why should I change
alliance that's carried me all
the way through?
I won't change.
I mean, I won't change.
 Why would he say that
if it wasn't true?
 That's what I'm saying.
I think Rupert has been a
truthful man, but if he told you
that...
 Yeah, he told me that.
 Well, then he's a lying
son of a bitch.
I told Rob from the beginning I
was going to stick with him all
the way through, but this fifth-
and sixth-grade tattletale
stuff, you know, I mean, I take
it personal, and I ain't happy
about it.
 You know me, Tom, I've
been straight since the
beginning.
 The very beginning.
 Since day one, day two,
whatever the hell it was.
I'd want to confront him.
Or you want him to just chump
you like that?
Sooner than later, it was like
two cats in a bag going at it.
 You telling him that you
want me to vote Rob off, that's
what he's saying, that was my
game plan.
 You didn't tell me
that we needed to get Rob off?
 Rob...
 Did you or did you
not tell me we needed to get Rob
off?
 Yeah. Let me tell you.
I'm just saying...
 Did you or did you
not tell me we needed to get Rob
off?
You was tired of watching him
sitting down and you needed
to get Rob off and you was
sorry you made an alliance
with him.
Did you not tell me that?
 The reason did I this
was get them at each other's
throats so that neither of them
will have enough sense to go to
each other and try to get me and
Amber off, and I think I
succeeded.
 Why would I want to get
Rob off when I've had an
alliance with him the whole
time?
You didn't even know I had an
alliance.
 Of course I knew you
had an alliance with him.
You told me you had an alliance
with him.
I also know you didn't want to
go to the final two with him.
 I would... that is our
alliance.
 Good!
 Well, then... then fine.
 You shouldn't sit
back there and be talking bad
about him.
Rob is playing this game so hard
now, I know that that was all a
ploy to try and make me look
bad.
That's fine.
I stood up, I told Big Tom
what's what.
 All I'm saying, you
running like a damn scared hound
to tell Rob something.
Now, is... now, that's playing
straight up?
 You've been talking
about getting rid of everybody,
Tom, behind everybody's back and
now I'm the bad guy?
 PROBST: What's going on,
guys?
Day 36.
The sun is out.
About the only thing that would
make this day any better is
having immunity around your neck
at end of the day.
Big Tom, I've got to get it
back.
Once again, immunity back up for
grabs.
Today's immunity challenge,
pretty simple.
It is a word scramble.
Your job is find the 17 tribe
names from the last eight
seasons that are hidden in the
scramble.
Once you've found all 17 names
you'll unscramble the
intersecting letter to spell
out one final mystery word.
First person to finish wins
immunity, guaranteed a spot in
the Final Four.
Nothing more important in this
game right now.
Nobody wants to come out here,
spend 36 days to go home fifth.
Just doesn't sound good.
Okay, we'll randomly draw
colors, wait for my go.
For immunity: survivors ready?
Go.
 Jenna with her first word
right off the bat.
Big Tom with one.
 Rupert using the tried and
true method.
He's got two.
As you get a word, mark it off
your list so you know.
Boston Rob has seven.
Amber with eight.
Rupert with six.
Big Tom with seven.
Jenna gets another word, she's
got nine.
 Amber still in the lead with
11.
Boston Rob right behind with
ten.
Remember, guys, you're looking
for the names of 17 past
Survivor tribes, and you're
going to unscramble the
intersecting letters and spell
out one final word.
Big Tom catching up.
He's at ten.
Amber up to 15.
Boston Rob picking it up,
closing in at 14.
Rupert with 12.
closing in at 14.
Rupert with 12.
Slowly gaining.
Amber has all her words.
Starting to unscramble
intersecting letters trying to
come up with that final mystery
word.
Don't give up, guys.
Everybody's still in it.
Jenna at 13.
Big Tom with 15; looking for two
more.
Everybody fighting, everybody
wants immunity.
Amber still trying to figure out
that mystery word.
 Rupert with another word.
He's got 14.
Boston Rob moves up to 16.
Big Tom moves up to 16.
He only needs one more.
 Got 'em all, Jeff.
Boston Rob with all 17
thinks he has the mystery word.
"Chabogo Mogo."
 Yeah!
 PROBST: Boston Rob wins
immunity!
Boston Rob.
I know everybody wanted it, but
only one of you gets it.
Nicely done.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Safe from the vote,
guaranteed a spot in the Final
For the others, not the same
good news.
Tonight the game will end for
one of you.
You have the afternoon to figure
out who that's going to be.
See you guys tonight at Tribal
Council.
 I want to wear that
damn necklace one time before
we leave.
 I think you put a hex on it.
You put a hex on that thing.
 Coming back with the
necklace on puts me in a good
position, but it's also a
precarious position, because I
hold the power.
The only way I don't hold the
power is if Rupert, Jenna and
Big Tom all team up and vote
Amber off.
That's the only way I don't
hold any power.
Whether they actually realize
that or not, I don't know, and
right now I'm kind of just
being the diplomat, sitting
back, listening to what
everybody has to say and
thinking about my options.
 I just want to say
congratulations, and I want to
apologize for having a
misunderstanding earlier.
 Big Tom is definitely
scrambling.
He knows that Rob and I are
not 100% with him, and he
knows that he's a swing vote
right now.
He knows that he could hop
over with Rupert and Jenna
right now and get rid of me if
they wanted to.
Everybody's talking and
everybody's paranoid.
 Everybody's paranoid
about the vote tonight, that's
all.
 I made an agreement
with y'all, if you all want to
break it, break it.
 I don't have an
immunity necklace around my
neck, so you can't blame me
for being paranoid and being
worried.
 Well, we've all
questioned me, now we'll see
when it comes to voting, who's
questioning who.
 Who do you think?
If you had to pick one or the
other?
 He wants Jenna gone.
 You want Jenna gone?
 I think Jenna's brain
is better than Rupert's.
 There's so much
paranoia, but at the same
time, I've trusted in this
alliance with Boston Rob and
Amber and it's worked out
exactly how we planned from
day 12.
That's insane that this
alliance has held up through
that whole thing, so I keep
thinking something has to go
wrong.
 Want to flip a coin?
Because that's how I feel
about this right now, and I
know as stupid as that sounds
with strategy, like, I feel
like I've been going through
it a million times in my mind.
Hey.
 Hey what?
 Come up here.
Let's be honest with each
other, if we can be honest for
one time, let's see if we can.
Have you or have you not tried
to mark me to get me kicked
out of this game?
 Absolutely not.
You marked yourself every time
you won, and I have not...
 And you haven't gone
to anybody and said we need to
get him off?
 No, no, sir, no, sir.
 Where does our
alliance stand now?
Let me ask you that.
We take out Jenna tonight,
then what happens?
Then we take out Rupert?
 I don't know.
You tell me.
 Why do I have to tell
you?
 Because I'm the pawn.
I told you, I'm the swing
vote.
 No, you're with us,
there is no swing.
We're a group, there's no
swing.
 Jenna and Rupert are
two.
All they need is one to get
smashed.
 Right, and you wanted
to be that one.
 Why would you think
I'd want with Rupert and
Jenna.
 I don't know.
Why you been feeding them
stuff for the last two weeks
telling them you want to get rid
of me?
 Come on, guys...
 There's way too many
stories going around.
 That's what I'm
saying.
Hey, listen, we're like
seventh graders here.
 I don't care about
anything that's happened in
the past.
I told you that I'll vote with
you and I'm going to vote with
you, so we're trying to figure
out who to vote on, if it
should be Jenna or Rupert.
 I like Rupert, but boy
that was a low-life thing that
he done.
It's taken me a little while
to get over it.
Jenna, she's an all right
girl, but she's a motor mouth.
All she is is mouth, and she's
smart enough to get... she's
smart enough to 'cause
trouble.
But, y'all, let's make up our
mind, because when you tell me,
that's what I'm putting on
that card.
 That's it. Let's do it.
 Let's do it, it's
Jenna... Jenna.
 There's no decision
that could be made right now
that I would feel 100% sure
about.
I hate being put in this
position.
It's a million dollar
decision.
 Very sensitive today,
huh?
 It's because...
You don't understand.
I can taste the money.
Do you realize how close we
are?
 Yeah.
 Of course I'm stressed.
It's a million dollars.
It's going to change our lives.
 That's right.
We're going to be okay.
 Tonight, Tribal
Council is going to be the
ugliest Tribal Council we've
had yet.
 PROBST: Now I'll bring in
had yet.
 PROBST: Now I'll bring in
the members of our jury-- Lex,
Kathy, Alicia and Shii Ann,
voted out at the last Tribal
Council.
Well, you've lasted 36 days,
and yet, for one of you, this
game is only moments away from
being over.
So, let's talk about the
status of camp.
Rupert, were things peaceful?
What happened?
 Things weren't...
things weren't peaceful, you
know?
There's some alliances being
tested, you know?
It's getting down to the end.
There's five of us here that
want to be the Final Two, you
know?
It's just getting kind of
hard.
 PROBST: Suspicion setting in,
Amber, is probably inevitable.
Did you sense it today?
 It's huge.
Today I sensed suspicion the
worst yet, and I'm starting to
get really anxious, really
nervous.
Today I think was probably the
most stressful day for me yet.
Um, I can smell the money it's
so close.
 PROBST: Jenna, Amber just
made a pretty honest comment,
"I can smell the money."
I'm sure all of you can get a
whiff of it at this point.
 That's all you can
do at this point.
With three days left, that's
all you live, breathe...
I mean, you're no longer
craving food, you're no longer
caring if you sleep-- the game
is everything.
 PROBST: So, Boston Rob, is it
inevitable that it's always
going to come down to this at
some point?
 In the end, you're
always going to have some
people that are playing a
little bit harder than others.
You're going to have some
people where the paranoia
starts to set in, people start
to scramble, people start to
get caught in their lies.
 PROBST: Did you notice
somebody getting caught in a
lie?
 I noticed a couple of
people getting caught on a
couple lies.
All I can say is I'm happy
that I'm wearing this necklace
tonight.
 PROBST: Amber, what are you
basing your vote on tonight?
 Tonight, and for
pretty much the very first
time, I'm going completely
with my gut.
I think tonight's vote is
extremely important.
I keep going back and forth in
my head wondering what the
best decision is, and the only
thing that I trust right now
is my gut, so I'm just going
to go with my gut.
 PROBST: Big Tom, how insulted
would you be if it is you
tonight and you've been
betrayed?
 You know what?
"Et, tu, Brute."
Even Jesus said it.
"Even you, Peter, betray me."
And you know what?
If that's the case, I don't
have to live with it, they'll
have to live with it, because
I get to sit in that jury and
decide-- was I done fairly?
 PROBST: Jenna, if it's you,
is this okay at 36 days?
Not bad.
 Not good enough.
Um, I came out the second time
to play the game to win, and I
would be upset if I was voted
off tonight, because it meant
that a lot of people lied, and
that's, I mean, that's a big
deal.
 PROBST: Boston Rob, you have
immunity, I assume you're not
giving it up.
 No.
 PROBST: Boston Rob is the
only person you cannot vote
for, everybody else is
vulnerable.
It is time to vote.
Big Tom, you're up.
 Pony ride's over.
Big Tom, you're up.
 Pony ride's over.
You're welcome for carrying
you this far.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
 PROBST: Once the votes are
read the decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote... Jenna.
Tom.
Tommy.
One vote Jenna, two votes Big
Tom.
The 14th person voted out of
Survivor: All Stars, and the
fifth member of our jury, Big
Tom.
That's three votes, that's
enough.
You need to bring me your
torch.
Big Tom, the tribe has spoken.
 I heard it.
 PROBST: It's time for you to
go.
 PROBST: Well, you lasted 36
go.
 PROBST: Well, you lasted 36
days, you made it to the Final
Four.
Once again, judging from
tonight's vote, it is clearly
anybody's game.
Grab your torches, head back
to camp. Good night.

Survivor.
 Started out with 18
of the best survivors to ever
play this game, and it's down
to four.
 PROBST: Only three days are
left.
 Somebody is leaving
tonight.
Boy, I hope it's not me.
 I just can't help
but feel nervous.
 PROBST: Find out next
time, in a two-hour special.
Who will be the sole survivor?
 What would you do for
a million dollars?
 Good God, pull that
knife out of my back.
Gosh, I'm mistaken.
There's two knives back there.
It's Rob and Amber.
But I'm going to be on that
jury, and the sticking's going
to be my turn.
But listen, don't worry about
me.
If you can live with it, I
live with it, and I'm going to
live with it happily ever
after.
So, farewell, fair-weather
friends.
