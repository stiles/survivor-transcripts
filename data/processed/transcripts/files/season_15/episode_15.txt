 --- 

         I really want to be here, and
I will do whatever to stay, you
know.
This game was not just physical.
I'm trying to think
strategically as well.
There's something inside of that
tube.
If you give it to me, I can help
save your life.
Sometimes, throughout this game,








I feel like I am the only one
playing.
We are lining ourselves up as
power players.
They will get rid of us if we
don't start doing what people
want.
I'm here to win a million
dollars.
That's a lot of money.

 JEFF PROBST: welcome to the








Survivor: China reunion show.
We have all 16 survivors back
together.
Let's start with our winner.
Todd, congratulations.
 Thank you!
( cheers and applause )
Thank you!
 PROBST: You're a guy that...
basically you've been watching
the show since you were a kid,
waiting until you were old
enough to get on the show.
So you've studied it from the
beginning.
Tell me about your game plan.
Because you had this laid out
about what you were going to do.
 I knew that the second I got
out there, that no matter what
it took, I would do everything I
possibly could to be sitting
right here.
I needed a second person who I
could trust from day one.
I needed someone smaller than
me.
I needed to be friends with the
strong guy.
I had all of these people in my
mind that could help me get
here, and I can't believe it
worked.
( laughter )
 PROBST: You were telling me
That also you were willing to
make relationships that you knew
you would betray, and then play
that at tribal council-- that
that was your game.
 All I could hope for was that
people would be able to say
Survivor is a game.
And I meant it when I said I
made relations and bonds with
people, and that those were
true, but everything inside of
the game was the game.
And I meant that.
And I knew I would fight it to
the end.
And they thought so, too, I
guess.
 PROBST: Jean-Robert, very
close vote.
That last vote goes either way
and we have a tie.
I'm going to roll a piece of
tape, remind you of a moment,
and then we're going to talk
about it.
Take a look at this.
 If somehow you end up
screwing me over, I'm going to
hold you responsible, so you
know, and you will not win.
( laughter )
 PROBST: So, you go in telling
him, "Look, if do you this, I
won't, and you won't."
He did it, you ended up voting
for him, and he did win.
That was the deciding vote.
When it's three votes-two with
one vote left, that's your vote.
Todd wins because of you, the
guy who said, "You will never
win if you betray me."
What changed your mind and made
you vote for Todd?
 Well, first of all, I had a
very difficult decision, because
I made the same promise to
Amanda as well.
 PROBST: But something changed
your mind.
 Basically he changed my mind
at that tribal with his answers
right there.
He just... it was part of the
game.
And...
 Specifically what part of his
answer?
 Well...
( laughter )
I don't know what you're getting
at, Jeff.
 PROBST: Jean-Robert, let me
remind you what we just saw a
minute ago, when Todd said, "The
reason I didn't vote you out,
Jean-Robert is... the reason I
voted you out is because you
were the bigger threat, not
James."
 Right.
You know, it's hard for me to
acknowledge that he recognized
me as a major threat.
He is right, and I...
( laughter )
 PROBST: And that got him your
vote.
 That got him my vote.
It really did.
I really thought that he made a
bad decision getting rid of me,
but, you know what?
That was the best move for him.
Get rid of the biggest threat.
Hey, it's kind of a compliment
in a sense.
 PROBST: It's a compliment if
it's true.
Now the question is... let's go
to Todd.
And, Todd, give me the truth--
did you believe at that moment
that he was the biggest threat
or did you on the cuff play
Jean-Robert?
 One thing I knew about Jean-
Robert was that he's a man who
loves his ego, and letting him
know that he is a better player
than you, and better at
something...
 PROBST: Did you play him?
 Kind of, yeah, I played him.
But you're a guy.
You're a great game player.
I just thought I was better than
you.
But I love you.
 He got me, then.
He gave a great answer, and he
deserved it.
And even when I put my vote in,
I said, "Hey, you know, if you
played me, well, you stole the
million."
 PROBST: Well, and it's a
compliment to you, I must say.
A lot of people that are on the
jury in this game get to a point
where they're so bitter that
they vote for the person they
hate the least.
I think it's a tribute you come
into this game and say, "Look,
I'm live.
I don't like any of you, but I'm
live.
Convince me I'll give it to
you."
Todd, tell me about the strategy
of the two key people.
You mentioned it several times.
The relationship with Amanda
started on day one, I think.
 Day one, we were Fei Long, we
got to camp, I looked at Amanda,
and we had some sort of
connection immediately.
So I pulled her aside and said,
"Look, I like you.
Without making anything
permanent, I want to know
that... I want you to know that
we can go far together in this
game."
Day four came around, she came
back to me and she said the same
thing.
We made that alliance.
It was official.
Day six, seven, or eight came
around and I was like, "I need
this one."
Why?
Because if we as a team lose a
challenge, I'm not the weakest
link because I was not the
smallest.
If I kept her around I was not
the big threat to go home.
And once we made the merge, I
was like, "People are thinking
she was kind of ornery a lot, so
why not keep her a little bit
longer?"
And it worked.
 PROBST: Tell us about what I
think a lot of people would say
was your riskiest move, and that
is giving James not one, but
two idols.
That seems like a crazy move.
 You know, giving James the
idols...
( laughter )
 PROBST: We'll get to you,
James.
We're coming.
We've got a lot of questions.
 Giving him these idols to me
was kind of securing my spot,
because I knew I needed the
strongest person on my side, and
I wanted him to know that I had
his back so I felt for sure that
I had hi... or he had mine.
And so giving him those, you
know, you can roll the dice and
hope it works out for you,
because it is a game, because
you have to have that to want to
go one step further.
And you have to take risks in
the game to be able to make it.
And I took a huge risk by giving
him that power.
 PROBST: Amanda, maybe the
biggest move you made in the
game was getting rid of James.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Tell me about what's
going through your mind on that.
Because that's got to be
nerve-wracking when you're at
tribal council having this...
this play in motion, hoping it
works.
 Yeah, it's nerve-wracking.
You're at tribal council, and
you're pretty much sweating
going, "I hope this works,
because if not, it's going to be
miserable at camp, and
everyone's..." you know.
Who knows what can happen?
He's going to kill everyone.
So it's pretty much... I was so
nervous that day, and it's
pretty much, like, a decision
that you make that can either
highly benefit your game or it
could ruin your game and
completely change it.
 Was there a point during
tribal council where you
thought, "He's going to play it,
he's going to figure out what's
happening"?
 Oh, yeah.
I remember when you came out
before you read the votes and
you said, "Does anybody have the
hidden immunity idol?
You can play it now."
And that dramatic pause was the
most nerve-wracking part of the
game for me, because I saw James
look at his bag three or four
different times, like, almost
reaching down to get it.
And I thought, "Oh, my god, he's
going to pull it out.
He's going to pull it out.
He's going to pull it out."
And I'm actually shocked he
didn't.
Like, I really thought he was
going to play it.
 PROBST: James...
( laughter )
Now, let's just set this up.
In case people aren't...
 WOMAN IN AUDIENCE: James,
you're awesome!
 Thank you, baby.
 PROBST: You've got fans, even
in spite of making the biggest
blunder in the history of this
game.
( cheers and applause )
All right, James, let's set this
up.
You've got two immunity idols.
You can only use it when there
are five people left in the
game.
That's the break.
Once it's after five, they're no
good.
There are seven people.
That's seven, six, five.
That means there are three times
you can use it.
You have two.
You're the most popular person
in the game, you're the biggest
threat, and you don't have
immunity around your neck, but
you've got two idols in your
pocket, and you don't play
either.
That's the question everybody is
wondering.
How does that happen?
 I mean, I... I don't know.
I was trusting my alliance.
I thought, you know, we'd be
together.
I rolled the dice, and it didn't
go through.
I mean...
 PROBST: Do you think that
cost you a million dollars?
 It honestly did.
I mean, you never know.
I mean, it might have been a
swimming challenge that come up
or something.
But as far as I could tell,
yeah.
I pretty much was a lock to make
it to the final three.
But it was fun.
 PROBST: We've got more with
you later.
Denise, though, getting back
into the strategy.
You have this chance, you're
with four, and you have this
chance to switch over with Peih-
Gee and Erik.
Why not take that?
 I thought it over.
I was like, you know, "If I
switch up and I go with Peih-Gee
and Erik, I have a chance to get
to the top."
And I then thought, "Well, if I
stay with Amanda and Todd, then
I get a second chance."
But I wasn't really sure which
way I wanted to go.
And finally I was just, "Todd,
Erik, Todd."
If Todd ends up winning the rock
or the fire challenge...
 PROBST: Denise, though, here
is the point,
With the other three, you're in
four.
You're at the bottom of four.
With Peih-Gee and Erik, you're
in three.
You get a shot at this million
dollars.
That's the fundamental flaw that
I saw in not making the move
just from numbers.
 Either way, I thought I would
be at the end, at the bottom.
I mean, I was... I thought Peih-
Gee would definitely win if we
went the final three with her
and me and Erik.
And I thought that Todd would
win if we went to the final
three with Todd and Amanda.
But I thought my best chance
would be to try to win the final
four immunity and take Amanda
and...
 PROBST: Fair enough.
Playing to win it on your own.
Peih-Gee, inside your head, how
close were you to getting Denise
to switch over?
 Oh, I mean, the problem was
that I looked at this, and I...
I knew Denise was going to be
out at four, you know.
And so I just kept thinking,
"Why is she going to settle for
four when she could have jumped
over and at least be in the top
three?"
And I think my biggest mistake
was maybe... I kept targeting
Todd.
And I think... sorry, Courtney,
I love you, but I think if I had
suggest maybe going for Courtney
she would have been more...
 Denise, is that true?
 I actually suggested
Courtney.
But Peih-Gee was so stubborn.
She was like, "It's Todd, it's
Todd, it's Todd."
And I'm like, "I can't vote
against Todd at this point."
 PROBST: Let's just take a
quick poll.
Those of you in the jury, now
it's Peih-Gee, Erik, and Denise.
Who wins of those three?
Is it Peih-Gee, like Denise
thinks?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: That close, Peih-Gee.
That close to a million bucks.
Todd would have been an
afterthought.
All right, up next, more with
James about the overwhelming
reaction he's had from people on
the street, even at the cemetery
where he's a gravedigger.
And two of the most outspoken
survivors ever, Courtney and
Jean-Robert.
Plus, Sprint is awarding a
$100,000 check to the survivor
you voted most popular.
We'll be right back.
( cheers and applause )
 I have never been anything
but my own winsome personality
since day one.
I believe that the USA
Hockey team is missing a player.
It's almost like a pageant.
"I need Amanda and Courtney by
my side.
They keep me warm."
Like I'm going to keep anyone
warm.
I weigh seven pounds.
I can't even keep myself warm.
Get off of me.
I seem to be marooned in a land
of, like, flight attendants and
Sunday school teachers.
Jean-Robert, he's become the
Susan Lucci of tribal council.
Like, his name is always up
there, but he never quite gets
voted out.
The biggest threat in the room
is the little blond.
Come on, everyone.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: China live reunion
show.
Courtney, I think you hold the
record for the most one-liners,
most zingers ever in a season.
 Too bad that wasn't a
challenge.
 PROBST: Yeah.
Too bad.
You work, in your normal life,
in a very popular restaurant in
New York City.
What's been the reaction?
Are you getting recognized a
lot?
 I get recognized by people
that are, like, tourists.
And little kids are the people
that recognize me the most.
Like, parents have no idea who I
am, and the kids are like,
"That's the girl from the show."
And they're like, "No, it's
not."
But it is.
 PROBST: What do you think it
is about kids?
 I don't know.
I think... I mean, I guess it
really is a, like, you know,
family show.
They sit down, and I think
little kids on the show with all
grown-ups, they pick the teeny
person to relate to.
I mean, I wear pigtails and a
flowered bathing suit, and I'm
like, "Don't tell me what to do.
You can't..." like I come off
like a little brat on the show
the entire time, so probably
kids can identify with that.
 PROBST: Do you enjoy that?
Do you like kids?
 No, I actually hate kids.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Courtney, you are
real.
If nothing else, you are
consistent.
Let's talk about the thing that
was probably the most common
question about you, is your
weight, the weight issue.
You started this at 93 pounds.
That was your starting weight.
You came off the show at 86
pounds, so you lost seven
percent of your body weight.
Anorexic, eating disorder?
What's the deal?
Answer the question.
 Well, Jeff, this is something
I have gotten my entire life,
all through high school I was
very, like, you know, very
popular to... health teaches are
were always all over me.
You know, it's just... I come
from a small family.
You saw my dad on the show, he's
tall and thin.
My brother is in the audience,
and he's built just like me,
too.
Hey, Brad.
That's just the way it is.
I don't really get too bent out
of shape about it.
Whatever.
People are going to talk.
 PROBST: You've heard this
enough that it's...
 Yeah.
 PROBST: And your weight now
is actually more than what it
was when the show started.
 Yeah, Jeff, thanks.
( laughter )
 PROBST: I guess that wasn't
the best thing to say.
 Jeff Probst just called me
fat.
( laughter )
 PROBST: One thing I just
wondered, did you enjoy any part
of this?
Because so many times it seemed
like you were miserable.
 Well, I really was miserable
for most of it, but, you know,
now that it's over I'm really
proud of myself because that is
not my element, even close.
I'm a barfly.
You know, I live in the city.
I go out and... you know, I'm
not really even awake during the
day most of the time.
So this is, like, completely
crazy.
And, you know, to be out doing
things like, "Now, pull this
lever and go over here and get
in the mud."
Like, it's nuts.
I'm like, "What the... how did
this happen to me?"
But, you know, I made it through
the end, and, you know, hey,
guys.
I did good.
I'm proud of myself.
 PROBST: Good, that's good to
hear.
Jean-Robert, you come into this
game as a professional poker
player-- and I have to say, in
spite of whether or not Todd
played you, your ability to read
people was pretty clear.
Day one, you said, "Todd, I know
you're a schemer, I've got to
watch you to the end."
You were right.
I don't know if it made it in
the show or not, but a couple of
times you pointed out, "Courtney
is going to make it to the end,
and you guys aren't going to see
it coming."
So you're good at reading
people.
But in terms of the nuances of
this game Survivor, do you think
you made some mistakes?
 You know, perhaps I made
mistakes, but I love the way I
played the game, you know?
If I had a chance to play it
again I would have played it
exactly the way I did.
You know, sometimes, Jeff, you
go all in with aces, and a
lesser hand calls you, and you
lose.
I go home holding my head up
high.
 PROBST: How did this change
your game?
You got back and went right back
out on the poker circuit.
How did it influence your game
one way or the other?
 I believe I'm playing the
best poker of my life right now.
My reads are sick, and I love
it.
You're going to see me winning a
million dollars on the poker
tournament coming up real soon.
 PROBST: Do you attribute that
to spending so much time...
because in Survivor you were
doing that all the time.
You were constantly having to
read whether people were telling
you the truth, bluffing, coming
from your left.
 I think it's a combination of
taking a small hiatus away from
the game and just reviving that
passion for the game, and just
having nothing to do but study
people and figure out what goes
on in their heads and figuring
out things two moves ahead,
three moves ahead.
I really think it did improve my
game, and I and I expect big
things to come.
 PROBST: All right.
Well, up next, two of the
season's most popular players,
James the gravedigger, and
Denise the lunch lady, they were
welcomed home in different ways.
We'll get that story.
Plus one survivor tonight is
going home with an extra
$100,000 in their pocket.
Taking us to break, our two
composers, David Vanacore and
Russ Landau.
( singing in Chinese )
 I'm a gravedigger.
My dad handed me a shovel at 11
and told me to start working.
And that's all I've ever done.
 I think James, he's like
superman.
I've never seen... he just
works.
 PROBST: James connects again!
James tosses Frosti in.
James is the last man standing.
 James, he's a strong,
physical, mental player of this
game.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: China live reunion
show.
James, it's been a long time
since we have had somebody as
popular as you on our show.
( cheers and applause )
Yes!
( cheers and applause )
What has the reaction been like?
 I mean, the reaction's been
nice.
I've been enjoying it.
I mean, I get it from kids and
older guys a lot.
( laughter )
They come up to me, pat on the
back, and everything.
 PROBST: Really?
Just kids and older guys?
 Come on!
 Women, too.
I mean, yes, I have improved in
that area as well.
You know, it's been nice.
I've been enjoying it.
 PROBST: What do people say to
you?
Why do they like you?
 They say because I pretty
much have no filter and I'll say
anything, or that I'm kind of
relatable and I'm real.
I don't know.
It's just cute.
 He's a stud.
 PROBST: Amanda says because
he's a stud.
Let's pop this People magazine
photo up there, speaking of
studs.
"Sexy Man of the Week."
( cheers and applause )
Well, here's what I want to
know-- wait a second.
Let's put up the childhood...
we've got a photo of you when
you were a little kid.
Who knew?
Who knew?
What's the craziest thing that's
happened?
What's the weirdest situation
where somebody's come up and
said, "Hey, you're James from
Survivor?"
A couple of weeks ago at a
funeral, and, you know, I'm
doing my thing.
I'm waiting for... usually I
wait for...
 PROBST: What is your thing?
You're at a funeral.
What does that mean?
 I set up... I dig graves.
I set up the tent, I set up the
chairs, you know, I set
everything up.
They usually bring the deceased
in and do their whole ceremony
and then they leave.
Well, this time while I was
waiting, I was waiting for them
to leave, they had a lady, two
ladies waiting, and they just
stayed there.
Usually they need help with
stuff, either with flowers, or,
you know, maybe needing just
help with something.
So I walked up to them and I was
like, you know, "Do you need
anything?"
And they were like, "It's him,
it's him."
( laughter )
And I was like, "Yes, it's me."
"It's the Survivor guy."
And they was all happy.
And I'm like, "Yes, ma'am, how
are you doing?"
I shook their hands and took a
couple of pictures.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Was it nice for you
to be able to turn what could be
a really sad moment... maybe
this is helping them grieve.
Did you feel that?
 That was part of the thing.
It really did make me feel good,
because, like, it took their
mind of everything that was
going on.
It was the mom and sister, it
turns out, and they were happy.
They were just happy to see me,
it made them feel good, so
hopefully it helped them deal
with the grieving process, which
is always nice.
 PROBST: Right on.
( cheers and applause )
Well, Denise, Denise, you had a
very different welcome home.
We just saw in the show where
you say in trying to plead your
case, you know, "This is it for
me.
I'm going back home.
I'm going back to being the
lunch lady, making seven dollars
an hour."
Only when you got home, that
isn't even what happened.
 No.
I want back, and I talked to the
food service director, and they
didn't give me my job back.
So I ended up having to go...
I'm a janitor now.
I clean the toilets, I wash the
floors in the bathroom.
I vacuum the kids' rugs.
Yeah, it's... I miss dinner with
my family.
I haven't been to a field hockey
game yet.
You know, I'm missing out a lot
more than I originally had
planned on doing.
 PROBST: And the reason I
think you said to me was that
it's actually because you're too
recognizable, you're a
distraction?
 Yeah, the original reason was
they said it would be too
distracting.
The kids all come in, and
everybody in the school comes up
to me, and everybody's like,
"Hey, how you doing?"
All the third-graders, they walk
by me in the afternoon, they're
like, "Hey, Denise, hey, Denise
hey, Denise."
125 of them walk by and every
one of them says hi to me.
So, I mean, I still... it's
emotional.
I mean, I miss my job.
You know, if anybody out there
is looking for a lunch lady, the
day shift, you know, give me a
call.
 PROBST: I want to ask you
about something that I was....
and this involves you, Courtney.
You know, the comment about, "I
don't want to give this woman a
million dollars because you suck
at life."
What... is that... do you regret
that comment?
 Yeah.
I say a lot of things without
thinking about it.
 PROBST: Well, here's your
chance.
 I've already apologized for
it.
 Absolutely.
There's no hard feelings.
It's all just a game, you know?
I love Courtney, I love Todd, I
love Amanda, I love all these
people.
 PROBST: Okay, well, if
everybody loves everybody, I'm
going to move on.
( laughter )
I've got to ask you, Denise,
about the hair.
( laughter )
Because it's an interesting
hairstyle.
And I know from talking to you
why you have it.
And I think it's time you share
with... because it makes the
mullet make perfect sense.
 Well, you know, I mean, I
worked in the kitchen.
You have to have short hair
because, you know, you have to
have a hairnet and everything.
But, you know, I still want to
be a woman.
I still want to make my husband
happy, and make him think that,
you know, I am a girl, and I do
love him.
( applause )
 PROBST: You can't beat that
answer.
We had another love affair
blooming on the show, from what
I hear, Jaime.
So let me ask if this is true.
What we saw on the show was a
little bit of flirting, it
looked like, between you and
Erik.
But it didn't really develop
into a lot more on the show.
 No, I was scared.
These people don't like when you
have friends.
So I was like, "They keep saying
I'm dating him.
Oh, no!"
 PROBST: So you didn't want
people to know you liked him
because you were afraid they
would see you guys as two votes
now together.
 Exactly.
And everyone would be like,
"Y'all are cute.
Y'all two like each other."
And I was like, "Uh-uh.
No."
I really did, but I was like,
"Uh-uh."
 PROBST: So what happened?
You get home and did you guys
talk?
 We both flew back into
Spartanburg and then actually
went to eat with our families.
 Because you live in the same
city.
 We live... well, no.
Our parents live 20 miles from
each other, so we went back to
our parents' houses, and we went
and hung out with each other's
families, and shopping and
started hanging out.
 Jaime are, you dating?
 Yes, we're dating.
 PROBST: You are dating.
( cheers and applause )
 Yeah!
 PROBST: So, Erik, on the
show...
( laughter )
It's very clear that are you a
virgin.
 Right.
 The only thing better than a
million dollars is a million
dollars and some....
( laughter )
 PROBST: So it begs the
question, Erik, dating Jaime,
are you still a virgin?
( laughter )
 Of course!
 PROBST: Of course.
 Mom's watching.
 PROBST: All right.
Well, which one of these 16
survivors is going to go home
with an extra 100K?
Find out when we return.
We will be right back.
More show coming up.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: China live reunion
show.
Somebody is about to get a
$100,000 bonus.
But first I want to check in
with a couple of other people.
Dave.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: One question.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Taking off your
clothes at a challenge, going
after James and Aaron, all
these... what were you thinking?
 It was my only strategy left.
This guy's huge.
This is Superman right here, as
he's been called earlier, and I
needed every possible advantage
I could.
I figured someone running at
this boy with his tackle and
whatnot jiggling around at you
in your sneakers could scare
anybody off, unless you're a
Greco-Roman from a couple of
millennia ago or something.
 PROBST: All right, so you had
a reason behind it.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Not sure it made
sense.
But okay.
 Some say I don't.
So...
 PROBST: Ashley, wrestler with
the WWE.
What's been the reaction from
your fans?
 They're okay with it.
You know, I got voted off second
and I was really bummed out
about it.
And I was so scared to come back
home and face this, because I
thought they were going to be
very disappointed with me.
But everybody's been really
cool, really supportive.
And they're just waiting for me
to get back in the ring, get
back in the action.
 PROBST: So they're fans of
Ashley.
They don't care how you did
on Survivor.
 Yeah, they're stoked that I'm
coming back to the WWE.
 PROBST: Aaron, the question I
have for you is, you know, you
were positioned in this game to
potentially go a long way.
It seemed like you had good
alliances going.
A twist comes along
as Survivor will do, and you're
out of the game.
What's it like to be at home and
to watch not being near as much
a part of the show as you wanted
to be?
 Yeah, you know what?
It was a golden road, you know?
My original alliance is in the
final three, you know, and that
was what it was, you know?
And it was like twist of the
game, and what could have been,
but you know what?
They all deserve to be up there.
And it was tough to watch, but
it was awesome.
It was still cool to see.
 PROBST: Leslie, do you
think... is something you're so
passionate about, religion, your
faith, do you think that is
ultimately what cost you having
a shot in this game, is that you
were ostracized because people
just didn't want to have to deal
with the morality?
 No, I don't think so.
I think my mouth got me in
trouble.
I mean, honestly.
You know, I... as I said in the
show, I'm not a religious
person.
I have a relationship with Jesus
Christ, and it's very personal
to me.
And I'm very passionate about
it.
But I'm also a human being who
just enjoys a challenge.
I've been trying out for
Survivor forever.
I finally got my dream.
It stinks I didn't last that
long.
But you know what?
I think it's really awesome that
they voted me off because I was
too well liked by both tribes.
So, whatever.
 PROBST: Healthy attitude,
that will always work.
Sherea, you came into this, I
felt a bit like a fish out of
water.
You're in your high heels and
dress.
You have to be... or let me ask
you, were you surprised at how
well you adapted?
You dominated at challenges when
you were in the game.
 I was very surprised.
I didn't come in thinking that I
was going to be physically one
of the strongest.
But I think that once I decided
I wasn't going to do much around
camp, I knew that in the
challenge I had to perform.
So once I tried...
( cheers )
 PROBST: Frosti, how long you
been doing parkour?
 I've been doing it for, like,
six years.
Both my parents teach martial
arts.
And so I had, like, a
background.
Now I was wishing there was just
obstacle courses in China.
Apparently nobody made the call
that I'm here to jump up
stuff.
Instead I got this on my head,
like, every day.
Boom, boom, boom!
 PROBST: And, Chicken, I've
got to ask, overall experience,
being first off, worth it?
 Yes.
If I didn't win the money, I'd
want to go first.
( cheers and applause )
 PROBST: Love the hat.
Okay, well, since Thursday,
viewers have been texting in
their votes for the Sprint Speed
Player of the Season.
In other words, they've been
voting for the survivor they
like the most.
The votes are in.
One of you is about to win
$100,000 courtesy of Sprint.
And I must say, not a bad payday
for just being popular.
So I have, in no particular
order, the three most popular,
who got the most votes.
Denise.
( cheers and applause )
James.
( cheers and applause )
And Peih-Gee.
( cheers and applause )
And the person whose bank
account just got fatter...
Is James.
( cheers and applause )
And I have one more...
David, let's bring it down just
a little bit.
I have one more last-minute...
this is very much a live show.
And our boss and the creator of
this show, Mark Burnett, was
backstage listening to Denise's
story.
Denise... and I'm not kidding.
Just now on the break, he said,
"Let Denise know that Mark
Burnett is going to give Denise
$50,000 to help get your life
the way you want it."
( cheers and applause )
All right, as Survivor: China
wraps up, we're ready to take
you on another adventure.
Find out where Survivor is going
next, and this time there's a
twist.
We'll be right back.
 PROBST: Welcome back.
Well, as we wrap up our 15th
season, I would just like to
thank our loyal viewers for once
again making Survivor the most-
watched show Thursday nights at
8:00.
And because of your loyalty, we
get to do it again.
And this time, we're doing
something we've never done
before.
Take a look.
For 15 seasons, Survivor has
taken millions of viewers to
remote locations all over the
world.
Many fans have watched from day
one and have always wanted to
play.
 I love Survivor.
 I feel at this point this is
exactly what I'm supposed to be
doing.
 I've been watching Survivor
since the beginning.
 My family has watched it
religiously since day one.
 Unbelievable.
 I'm so excited.
 I've watched every episode.
 I'm ready to go.
I felt ready to do this.
 PROBST: Now a select few will
get their chance at the
adventure of a lifetime.
What they don't know is they'll
be playing against the ultimate
competitors-- favorite castaways
from the past.
Who will these competitors be?
Will the former survivors be
able to put aside their past
conflicts and come together as a
tribe, or will the superfans
outwit, outplay, and outlast the
favorites?
Tune in this February and find
out on Survivor: Micronesia,
Fans Versus Favorites.
Who will be among the favorites?
Well, I can tell you this-- at
least one of these 16 will be
returning next season.
Tomorrow morning, Todd will
appear on The Early Show on CBS
and receive his check for a
million dollars.
And if you want to own a piece
of Survivor: China, immediately
following tonight's show you can
bid on one-of-a-kind memorabilia
to benefit the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
The Web site's on the screen.
The auction runs through
December 30.
To date, Survivor fans have
raised more than two million
dollars to ensure a healthier
future for children worldwide.
Finally if you really want to be
on the show, put together a
three-minute videotape and send
it to us.
As always, we appreciate your
loyal support.
We will see you next season for
Survivor: Fans Versus
Favorites.
Good night.
