         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, in
ultramodern Shanghai, 16
Americans began the adventure of
a lifetime.
They were transported back in
time to a remote region on the
shore of the Lake of a Thousand
Islands.
They were divided into two
tribes.
Yellow tribe, your name is








Zhan Hu.
Red tribe, your name is Fei
Long.
The Fei Long Tribe quickly
established themselves as hard-
working and strategic.
 We need a commander.
 I think I can do it.
 PROBST: And on day one, an
important alliance was formed
between Todd and Amanda.
 I will stick with you because
you know this game.
 You're my loyal alliance too.








 Okay.
 PROBST: The Zhan Hu tribe was
hopelessly disorganized, and
when they weren't goofing off,
they argued.
 Back up off me.
 Would you please...
 Back up off me!
 PROBST: Their lack of
cohesiveness seemed to affect
their performance in the
challenge.
Zhan Hu getting nowhere with the
puzzle.
Fei Long wins immunity!
After losing the first immunity
challenge, Zhan Hu sent Chicken
home.
 Damn!
 PROBST: On day four, at the
first reward challenge...
Fei Long wins!
...a new twist was revealed.
Fei Long, because you defeated
Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap
one member of their tribe.
The kidnapped person was given a
clue to the location of a hidden
immunity idol.
 "You must give this sealed
clue to a member of the tribe
before you rejoin your own
tribe."
 PROBST: Back at Fei Long,
Leslie got the first clue, and
she shared it with Todd.
 I can't believe she told me.
I'm in shock.
I would never tell anybody.
 PROBST: At Zhan Hu, the
problems continued.
 It looks like a natural
disaster hit our camp.
 PROBST: Zhan Hu falling
behind!
Fei Long is through!
And they lost yet again.
Fei Long wins immunity!
So Ashley was sent home.
By day nine, Leslie and Todd
still hadn't found the idol, and
when Zhan Hu finally won an
immunity challenge, Fei Long
made their first visit to tribal
council...
Third person voted out of
Survivor: China...
...and Leslie was sent home.
Todd and James both launch and
both connect!
At the next immunity challenge,
Fei Long regained their
dominance.
Fei Long wins immunity!
And Zhan Hu sent Dave home.
On day 13, the game dramatically
changed.
 Someone's coming in.
 Oh, no, you guys.
Something's going on.
 PROBST: The tribes swapped
their two best players.
 Oh, the humanity.
 PROBST: James and Aaron went
to Zhan Hu.
Frosti and Sherea went to Fei
Long.
Thinking of the future and a
possible merge, the Zhan Hu
women came up with a plan to
weaken Fei Long.
 If we throw these next two,
not only have we gotten rid of
the two biggest threats for
individual immunity, we will be
going into a merge with five
original Zhan Hu.
 PROBST: Peih-Gee and Jaime
threw the immunity challenge...
Fei Long wins immunity!
...and voted off Aaron.
They planned to throw the next
challenge and vote off James.
But Todd came up with a counter-
plan.
 If we win reward today, we
are bringing over either Aaron
or James, whoever is left,
because they're going to give us
a clue as to where that hidden
immunity idol is.
 Bring him back, baby.
 Come back, James.
 Come on, James.
Come on home.
 PROBST: Fei Long kidnapped
James, and Todd got his clue to
the hidden immunity idol.
 I know what to do, dude.
 PROBST: Todd found the idol
and gave it to James so he could
save himself at the next Zhan Hu
tribal council.
 James loses immunity.
They vote for him, but he uses
the idol to get rid of Jaime.
 PROBST: Having rejoined the
Zhan Hu Tribe, James was ready
to throw the food-eating
immunity challenge.
 Bite it!
 PROBST: But when he went up
against Denise....
 I can't swallow it.
 PROBST: ...she unexpectedly
gave up.
Zhan Hu wins immunity.
 Perfect plan smashed.
 PROBST: In only their second
trip to tribal council, Fei Long
voted out the former Zhan Hu
member Sherea.
The tribe has spoken.
At Zhan Hu, James found the
second hidden immunity idol,
making him virtually invincible.
 That's funny.
I'm on Survivor with two idols.
 PROBST: On day 20...
Drop your buffs.
You are merged.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: ...with a 6-4
advantage, the former members of
Fei Long made a pact to vote out
the former Zhan Hu.
 We have every vote from here
on out.
 I know.
 We just have to keep loyal.
We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee
and Erik break us up.
 I don't want any dissension
amongst us until we get to the
final six, until all of them are
gone.
 PROBST: The first target
after the merge was Jaime.
The tribe has spoken.
The former Fei Long seemed
intact.
Jean-Robert then decided to go
against the plan and tried to
oust one of his own, his former
ally James.
 We could blindside him
tonight, because he will not
pull out the idol tonight.
 I know, I know.
 PROBST: But instead, Todd
convinced the alliance to send
Jean-Robert home.
 PROBST: Jean-Robert, the
tribe has spoken.
Frosti went next.
And with seven remaining, the
Fei Long alliance of five seemed
impenetrable.
Then Amanda tried to take over
the game.
 If we get rid of James
tonight...
Let's just get this over with,
because I'm tired of not being
in control.
I like control.
 PROBST: And she easily
convinced everyone else to get
on board.
 I will do what everybody
feels the most comfortable
doing.
 PROBST: Confident in his
alliance...
If anyone has a hidden immunity
idol, now would be the time to
play it.
...James chose not to play one
of his idols.
James.
And he was voted out by the
people he trusted.
The tribe has spoken.
To Peih-Gee and Erik's surprise,
they were still in the game.
 If I can get one or maybe
even two more people, we could
possibly cause a tie at tribal
council.
 PROBST: The former Zhan Hu
tried to make a play to split
the alliance of four by
targeting Todd.
 You guys don't think I have
anything to be worried about, do
you?
 No.
 PROBST: But their plan
failed.
Erik, you need to bring me your
torch.
And Erik and Peih-Gee found
themselves on the jury.
Now four are left: Courtney, the
waitress...
 I went in calling myself the
absolute biggest long shot, and
I still think I'm the longest
shot to win it, but the fact
that I've made it this far is
insane.
 PROBST: ...Denise, the lunch
lady...
 I can overcome anything.
I can survive anything.
And you know, this is a life-
changing experience for me.
 PROBST: ...Amanda, the beauty
queen...
 Everyone thinks that I've
been a quiet player.
Well, I've been quiet because
it's been part of my strategy.
 PROBST: ...and Todd, the
flight attendant.
 I wasn't the strongest, I
wasn't the smartest, but I was
definitely the most strategic.
 PROBST: All four have stayed
loyal to each other from the
beginning, but who will be the
first to turn on the others?
Find out tonight as they compete
to stay in the game, and one
will outlast all the rest and
become the soul survive.

 I can't believe it.
 How crazy?
 Final four.
How fantastic is that?
 Unbelievable.
 Yeah.
I'm, like, in shock.
I thought I would be out in 16th
place.
So here I am, guaranteed at
least one in four of winning.
We are final four on Survivor
freaking China.
 A pack of four bitches.
 Oh, my God.
 I love us.
 I've always sort of slipped
through the cracks to get to the
top, so hopefully I can continue
to slip through.
The four of us were, like, you
know, the bottom of the totem
pole from the beginning.
 Exactly.
 The immunity challenge that
we have left, we'll have to see
what it is.
If it's something that I can
pull off, then, I mean, that
would be a great way to go to
the final three-- with, you
know, the immunity necklace.
 I can't believe it's day 37.
 Yeah, no kidding.
Unbelievable.
I just want to be happy for one
day while I'm here.
 Right.
 We're definitely in need of
food right now, so any kind of
food and fuel at this point
would help us, help me out
immensely, and just to get us
through this final couple days.
How comfortable can you be on a
bamboo bed?
Now it's the final four, and
someone else is going to go
home, and now it's going to be a
tough fight.
But, I mean, I've proven myself
a lot.
I mean, what I've learned about
myself, I mean, I can overcome
anything, and you know, this is
a life-changing experience for
me.
 Tree mail!
 What does it say?
A reward challenge or an
immunity?
 I don't know.
"One last chance to win some
fuel, great food and drinks and
treats.
Put blocks back into out Great
Wall for another chance to eat."
 I bet it's pizza and beer.
 Oh, my God.
I'm going to cry.
I've kind of been in a funk the
past couple days because I've
had no food.
This reward is going to be
probably the most important
reward of the game so far, just
because you know you have
immunity coming up.
You need energy.
It has to be done.
 This will be good.
 Food, man.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Guys ready to get to today's
reward challenge?
 Uh-huh.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: For today's reward
challenge, you must tackle our
version of the Great Wall of
China.
On my go, you'll start at the
top of the wall, climb down a
ladder, and cross a bridge.
You'll come to another bridge,
where you must use planks to
finish building the bridge
before you cross it.
At the end of the course, you'll
find a traditional Chinese yoke
and a stack of puzzle blocks.
You'll use the yoke to transport
the blocks back to the top of
the wall.
Once you have all your blocks at
the top of the wall, you can
start solving the puzzle by
filling in your section of the
wall.
First person to finish wins
reward.
Want to know what you're playing
for?
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: You're playing for
comfort and advantage-- comfort
in the form of the kind of food
your taste buds have been
craving for 37 days.
 Oh!
 I'm going to cry.
Oh!
 PROBST: Pizza, beer, soft
drinks, brownies.
 I want the brownie real bad.
 PROBST: You get the emotional
comfort, the kind of food that
will make you feel better.
The advantage comes in the
calories you will put into your
body heading into the next
immunity challenge.
This is a serving for one.
And I don't have to tell you,
food and strength are critical
as you get closer to that
million dollars.
I know it's worth playing for.
We'll get started.
Head over to the wall.
Here we go.
For reward, survivors ready?
Go!
Todd takes a big jump, not
wasting anything time.
First stage, you have to finish
building the bridge before you
can cross it.
It only goes together one way.
Everybody working quickly.
Todd with another piece.
Amanda working from the front
back.
Courtney with another piece.
Todd and Amanda both getting
very close.
Denise struggling.
Amanda down to her last two
pieces.
Todd down to his last two
pieces.
Todd has the bridge completed.
Amanda has the bridge completed.
Todd and Amanda making quick
work of this.
Todd with his first bundle of
puzzle blocks.
He's heading over the bridges,
Amanda right behind.
Courtney and Denise still trying
to finish that bridge.
Todd through the wall.
Courtney not quitting.
It is Todd and Amanda right now.
Denise and Courtney quickly
falling out of it.
Pizza, beer, brownies, soft
drinks.
Todd heading back with the rest
of his puzzle blocks.
Courtney has her bridge
finished.
Denise the only one left working
on the bridge.
Todd is back.
He has all 12 of his blocks.
Start working on the puzzle.
You are looking for the gray on
the top and the sides.
If you see color, it is not
right.
Amanda back with the rest of her
puzzle blocks.
Courtney heading back with her
first stack of puzzle blocks.
Denise still trying to solve the
bridge.
You have 12 pieces.
They only go together one way.
Todd working on his puzzle.
Courtney back with her first
stack of puzzle blocks.
Got to dump them and head back
out.
The top and the front should be
gray, just like the color of the
wall.
Courtney heading back down as
Denise finally finishes her
bridge.
She's back in it.
Todd and Amanda with a huge lead
right now.
This is not an easy puzzle to
solve.
Courtney heading back with her
second and final stack of puzzle
blocks.
Denise heading back with her
first bundle of puzzle blocks.
Take your time.
Courtney has all of her puzzle
blocks.
Start working on the puzzle.
Denise back with her first stack
of puzzle blocks.
Dump them and go.
Denise heading back out.
You're still in it.
Todd making progress.
It's a difficult puzzle.
Courtney close, but is she close
enough to solve it or just close
enough to be wrong?
Denise back with the rest of her
puzzle blocks.
She's now starting to work on
the puzzle.
Todd getting close.
Amanda thinks she may be on to
something.
Amanda wins reward!
 Oh, my God!
I can't believe I did that.
 Good job, Amanda.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: All right, Amanda,
come on over.
 Thank you, guys.
( applause )
You guys did really good too.
 PROBST: Nice job.
Pizza, beer, soft drinks,
brownies.
With every reward comes a
dilemma.
Here's yours.
This is a serving for one.
You can keep it that way and
make sure you're the one that
gets all the emotional comfort
and all the calories heading
into the next immunity
challenge, or you can invite one
or two people to join you.
Whatever decision you make will
have an impact on somebody.
 Oh, God.
I hate this.
 PROBST: What's going through
your head?
Is there a part of you thinking,
"It'd be cleaner to just keep
this for myself"?
 Well, I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings, so I feel
like if I eat alone, then, you
know, they're all on even
ground, and I'm not, like,
choosing one over another.
But then it's hard, because
Denise has chose me for a reward
before, and you know, I love
Todd and Courtney.
So I'm, like, torn, you know.
 PROBST: Take a minute.
 Oh, God!
 PROBST: Day 37, final four,
million-dollar prize at the end.
How will this decision factor
into the finish?
 I'm sorry, you guys.
Todd, I'm going to have Todd
stay with me.
 PROBST: Todd, come on over.
You're sticking with one person.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Denise, Courtney, got
nothing for you.
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
 Oh, it's a pizza with a
butterfly.
Oh, my gosh.
 Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
 Sure.
Well, I thought this would give
us, like, a good opportunity to
talk, since we haven't...
 Since we don't get to talk.
 The reward today was pizza,
and I could take along one or
two people.
I definitely wanted to take Todd
because I wanted to see where
his head was at, because I don't
trust Todd at all.
Like, I honestly think if he
would have won today, he
wouldn't have picked me to eat.
I think he would have picked
Courtney or Denise.
 Dig in, girl!
 Oh, my God.
 I can't tell you how happy I
am that you picked me.
Thank you.
 That was, like, the hardest
decision I've ever had to make.
 Amanda, you needed that so
bad.
 I know.
I'm glad we have the chance to
talk, though, because I... there
are some things that happened
that I don't understand, and it
makes me, like... honestly, I
don't trust you that much, like,
from what I've heard.
 What?
 Yeah.
And I don't know, like, it just
makes you wonder, because you
hear all this stuff, and them
I'm like... I just have the
feeling that if anyone was to
backstab me right now, you
would.
 That makes me feel kind of
sad.
You know, it hurts me.
But I can tell by the way you've
been looking at me that you've
been, like, antsy about me.
But there's one girl in this
game that I've been honest to
literally since day one.
That's been you.
 And I've been honest to you
too.
I'm just glad we get to clear
the air now.
 Right.
 Because you get voted out,
and you're like, "Oh, my God,"
like, you know what I mean?
 Amanda flat out let me know
that the past couple of days she
hasn't been trusting me, which
hurt my feelings, because I
really have been in my head
knowing that I'm going to stay
true to Amanda.
Honestly, swear on my mama's
life, if it was the final two,
it's me and you, because that's
my deal.
I'm not very cool with losing to
Denise, and I'm not very cool
with losing to Courtney.
You don't have to trust me, but,
like, that's the honest, 100%
truth from Todd.
I swear on my life.
I'm in this to the end with you.
I hope that she can trust me.
I really, really hope so,
because I need her right now.
 Jump in?
 I'm going to lay here and be
stinky for a little while, and
then I might jump in.
 I'm going to jump in.
Then I'm going to come back and
lay here and be stinky.
 It hurt my feelings a little
that Amanda didn't take me.
Pizza and beer would have been
great today.
I would have enjoyed it.
We haven't been eating too much
around here.
So any time that you get to eat
something and get stronger for
the next challenges is very
important.
When I was a kid, I wasn't the
popular kid.
I was always on the outside.
And a lot of times during this
game, I wasn't picked.
I was picked last or I was
picked second to last or I
wasn't picked at all.
But having an alliance, being in
a group of, you know, four
people, I've been safe.
But now it's four people.
One's going home.
It's... you know, there is going
to be somebody left out.
It is so humid and hot out here.
 Yeah.
I've sort of embraced it.
I'm just going to be in a sweat
bath for the rest of the day.
 I thought Todd and you were
pretty tight.
It looks like Todd and Amanda
are pretty tight.
 We'll just have to see what
happens.
 Todd.
 Isn't he, though?
 You know, a lot's going
through my head right now.
It's kind of a mix of, well, can
I trust my girls that I've been
trusting for so long, or are
they going to turn on me?
But I have no choice but to just
hope, you know?
I can talk all I want, but other
than that, I have to just hope.
 Hi, guys.
 What's up?
 It was good.
It's like 900,000 degrees too.
 Exactly.
 I love all three of you girls
so much, so no matter whose name
I have to write down tomorrow, I
have to write down one of the
three of your names, and bottom
line, it hurts.
 You know, I just don't want
to go home yet.
 I hear you.
I don't know.
I really am afraid that it's
going to go all girl power on me
tomorrow and I'll probably be
the one that's gone.
But, I mean, I'm in the fight to
win, just like everybody else is
going to fight to win.
 Who do you think has the best
chance right now of winning?
 Amanda or Courtney.
 So, I mean, then... I mean,
there you go.
I mean, there's two people to
get rid of that at least have a
chance of getting more votes
than either one of us.
 Uh-huh.
Believe me.
I've thought about it.
 Todd and Denise were laying
in the shelter, and I heard them
talking, and I heard my name.
So I just kind of sat there and
listened to them talk.
 I'm bugged by the fact that
I've built relationships with
all of you guys, and I hope it
doesn't ruin whoever's name I
have to write down.
 Right.
 Todd, I think, is a slippery
little sucker and always has
been.
He does hold a lot of the cards,
and he always manages to weasel
his way into something.
So whether it's half of a pizza
or a seat in the top three,
like, you can count on Todd.
He will not look out for you.
He does not care.
He is looking out for himself.
 Todd and Denise were, like,
talking in the shelter.
They were, like, talking about
the final four or whatever.
So I don't know if Todd is,
like, just paranoid at this
point, but he's, like, just
talking different stories to
each one of us.
 That's why I had Todd go,
just because, like, I wanted him
to still feel like he could
trust me, you know?
Well, Todd was, like, telling
me, "No, I want you, me, and
Courtney.
Like, you can trust me.
I'm in this."
And I told him point blank,
"Todd, I don't trust you.
Give me some reason why me and
Courtney should trust you right
now, because honestly, I don't."
And I told him point blank I
didn't.
Then he's like, "Amanda, it's
the final two, and let's get rid
of Courtney."
And I'm like, "You're telling
everyone a different story."
Hey.
 Hey, guys.
What's up?
 Nada.
Nada-banada.
 I know I'm feeling paranoia
to be left alone.
I see people gather off on their
own, and that bugs me.
 I just want to, like... I
don't know, like, are we cool?
If one of the three of us wins,
she's going?
 Yeah.
 I'm hoping that Courtney and
Amanda are still on the same
wavelengths as me so that Denise
can be the next on the chopping
block instead of them going all
girl power on me and voting me
out.
So paranoia on my side is quite
high, and I hate being paranoid.
I hate it.
I don't know.
I think we'd be probably the
most fantastic final three in
the entire world.
 Hey, girlies, tree mail.
It's sealed.
Okay, you guys ready?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
"Congratulations, final four.
You have done what 12 of your
fellow tribesmen and women could
not.
Today you will honor their
memories before proceeding to
your final immunity challenge.
Get into your boat and paddle
across the lake to the giant
statue of Guanyin, the Chinese
goddess of compassion and mercy.
There you will find the torches
of your fallen comrades.
As you pass them, light the
firecrackers in celebration of
their time here in China,
remembering them as each had a
part in getting you this far.
You will then proceed to your
final immunity challenge."
Every single person that's been
voted off has helped me to get
here.
I am grateful for them.
I absolutely think that they've
all done a huge part in me
getting to the end.
It's so bittersweet.
Like, you're so sad to be
leaving people that you really
like, but there were 16 of us,
and one of us is going to be the
winner.
 You guys ready?
 Yeah.
 Let's do this.
 All right, here we go.
 Chicken.
 With a name like Chicken, how
can you not be cool?
( firecrackers popping )
 Going into the game, I was
going to be myself.
I never thought about being the
person voted off, so it was
tough.
I couldn't relate to the people.
You know, I tried.
It was just I'm out of their
generation big time.
 Ashley, I really, really wish
that we had more of a chance to
get to know each other, because
I bet we would have been good
friends.
( firecrackers popping )
 I'm a professional wrestler.
I've done all kinds of stuff
where I had to stick it out.
But I wasn't expecting this, to
tell you the truth.
Having had this experience, I
got to do some stuff that I've
never imagined I would be doing,
just, like, being huddled up
underneath our little walkway
in, like, a monsoon
thunderstorm.
Things like that, like, that are
just crazy stories that I'll
probably tell my grandchildren,
that's some stuff I'll take home
from being here.
 So, Leslie, we were probably
the most unlikely friends, but I
hope I made you proud.
( firecrackers popping )
 Survivor is a hard game.
It's a game that changes you,
spiritually, emotionally,
mentally, definitely physically.
I mean, it changes every aspect
of you-- and definitely for the
better.
And I can tell you, as miserable
as I was for nine days, I would
do it again in a heartbeat.
 Crazy Dave.
I mean, what can you say?
The guy's fun.
( firecrackers popping )
 My strategy going into the
game was to be indispensable
around camp and to be highly
likable.
I was really passionate about
helping people, and it was
potentially my downfall.
 Aaron.
I miss Aaron.
I love Aaron-- so fun.
( firecrackers popping )
 The hardest part of the game
for me was trying to wear too
many hats, trying to please too
many people.
But playing the game of Survivor
is a lot like surfing in that,
you know, put yourself in an
element that you're not really
used to.
I've gone over plenty of the
falls, and I take my share of
wipeouts, but you always keep
going back for more, and then
the next day, the challenge
comes, and you're the one who
wins it for your tribe, and
you're on that high, and you're
like, "This is the reason I
signed up for it."
 Sherea.
I miss you a lot, and you were
one of my good friends.
( firecrackers popping )
 Survivor gave me a great
sense of adventure in myself.
I was totally out of my element
and didn't think I really could
do it, and I did.
Now I know that I'm way stronger
than I even thought I was.
 Oh, Jaime, love, having you
around camp was like always
having your favorite piece of
bubble gum in your mouth--
funtastic.
 I had a good time out there,
believe it or not.
I would do it again in a
heartbeat.
I'm pretty loud, I'm pretty
boisterous, and I pretty much
let people know what's going on
in my head.
I think I was blessed that I had
Erik as a friend out there,
which you don't usually feel on
Survivor.
A lot of people didn't
understand where I was coming
from, but Erik understood
everything.
I definitely see him as a friend
even after the game.
 Ooh, Jean-Robert.
I think he's going to be the
player most changed after this.
 Let us all hope that he's the
most changed after this.
( firecrackers popping )
 I started out kind of rubbing
people the wrong way and
annoying them, but that's part
of who I am.
It's not all of who I am.
I'm very well aware of feelings
that are going on around me.
Did I come out a better person,
a stronger person?
I'd like to think so.
Perhaps I will be a better poker
player in the long run because
of this.
 Frosti.
You're my Munchkin, and I
absolutely adore you, and I hope
that you'll forgive me and we
can still be friends.
 My Survivor experience was
unforgettable.
I know that I'm changed because
of it.
I think for somebody as young as
myself, this is a really big
step for me, and it's really
helped me on my own path in
life.
 James, a terrific athlete,
he's a great guy.
Under that big, rough exterior
was a great, big, giant teddy
bear.
( firecrackers popping )
 The hardest part for me was
dealing with all the
personalities.
I'm kind of not the most
talkative guy of the group.
So, I mean, just dealing with
all of those different
personalities, it was odd for
me.
But... so I know now that I can
handle other people.
 Oh, Erik, he's such a nice
person.
Like, he was like a genuinely,
like, kind individual.
( firecrackers popping )
 The game of Survivor has
definitely been one of the
hardest things I've ever done.
But it was so much fun.
I wouldn't trade any of it.
I'm not a risk taker in life.
I'm cautious, like, in
relationships.
So I like to think that I'm
changed.
Real relationships, real bonds
are what I want to continue to
maintain.
 I have a lot of admiration
for Peih-Gee, being of tiny
stature, like myself, and she
was ten times the fighter anyone
ever thought, so...
( firecrackers popping )
 Being Chinese and coming in
to China, I mean, I got strength
from Mother China.
I overcame huge odds, and I
managed to fight my way through
to final five, and I'm just glad
that I did myself proud here in
China.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Guys ready to get to your final
immunity challenge?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: For one of you, this
will guarantee a spot in the
final tribal council and a shot
at the million dollars.
 PROBST: Guys ready to get to
your final immunity challenge?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: First things first.
Amanda, take back the immunity
necklace.
The last time immunity is back
up for grabs.
Today's challenge will test your
ability to eliminate all
distractions and focus solely on
the task at hand.
For today's challenge, you must
balance porcelain dishes on the
end of a long, wobbly balancing
arm.
The more dishes you stack and
the longer you hold them, the
more difficult it will become to
keep them stable.
When you can no longer hold your
dishes stable, they'll fall off,
you're out of the challenge.
Last person left standing wins
immunity, is guaranteed a spot
in the final tribal council and
a shot at the million dollars.
Each station has been adjusted
for your height.
Let's get started.
First dish you're putting on is
the large plate.
Give you a chance to get used to
this arm, how it works.
Next item you're going to place
on is the large bowl.
Everybody put it on.
Three, two, one.
Set it down.
Next dish you're putting on is
the small plate.
Three, two, one.
Next dish will be the rice bowl.
That is the large, round bowl to
your left.
Everybody grab it.
All right, three, two, one.
Set it on.
Now it's going to get
interesting.
Very, very hot day, no breeze.
Todd's starting to wobble just a
little bit.
The next dish you're going to
place on is the small bowl-- not
the big bowl and not the soy
sauce.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, place it.
Todd's still shaking a bit.
This is an opportunity to
guarantee that you have a shot
at the million dollars.
All right, the next dish you're
going to place is another small
bowl-- same item you just placed
last time.
You're going to put a second
small bowl on.
Three, two, one, set it in.
Everybody's still doing very
well.
You have nothing to do but dig
deep.
Todd cannot hang on.
Todd's the first person out of
the challenge.
Todd, have a seat on the bench.
Time to place another item.
This time you're going to add
the rice bowl.
Here we go.
Three, two, one, place it.
Amanda makes a strategic move
and goes the other direction.
 Ah!
 PROBST: Courtney's starting
to wobble.
Amanda very cool, collected.
This is it.
There are no other challenges,
no other big tasks that you have
to do.
Stay focused.
 I don't feel good.
 PROBST: Courtney fighting
through a lot of pain.
Keep fighting, Courtney.
You are this close to a shot at
a million bucks.
Courtney's the second person out
of the challenge.
We are now down to two.
Either Amanda or Denise is going
to win this challenge and be
guaranteed a spot at the final
tribal council, guaranteed a
chance to plead your case to the
jury.
 All right, Amanda, what do
you think?
 What do you mean?
 Make a deal?
 You don't want to give up
easily, do you?
Come on.
 Come on.
I won't write your name down;
you don't write my name down.
 I'm not giving up, Denise.
 PROBST: Be careful of losing
your concentration.
It does not take much for those
dishes to fall.
 I'll tell you, I'm going to
puke, though.
 PROBST: Time to place another
item.
 Oh, crap.
 PROBST: You're going to place
another rice bowl.
 Are you sure, Amanda?
 Yup.
Come on, let's battle this out,
Denise.
 PROBST: Amanda and Denise
both put the last rice bowl in
different positions.
Amanda's going to stay with
hers.
Denise is going to stay with
hers.
Amanda not interested in a deal.
Denise loses concentration.
Amanda wins the final immunity
challenge.
 Think I was going to let you
quit on me?
Come on!
 PROBST: Amanda is going to
the final tribal council.
 Good job.
 Good job, girls.
Congratulations, Amanda.
 Good job.
 PROBST: Amanda, come on over.
 Congratulations, Amanda.
( applause )
 Thank you.
 Good job, kid.
 Thanks, guys.
 PROBST: If there was ever a
time to have this, now is the
time.
With this around your neck, you
are guaranteed a spot at the
final tribal council and a
chance to plead your case for a
million bucks.
Denise, Todd, Courtney, tribal
council tonight, one of you will
be voted out and will become the
final member of our jury.
If there was ever a time to pull
out all the stops, to try to
make a deal, to make something
happen, this is it.
Head on back to camp.
See you at tribal.
 Thank you.
 I'm so excited that I'm for
sure in the final three.
I have nothing to worry about
tonight, but I'm afraid whoever
gets voted out tonight is going
to think that it was because of
me, because I'm the free vote
tonight.
So it's such a good thing, and
then it can be such a bad thing.
 I feel really, really nervous
right now.
You know, a lot of these kids
are so much younger than I am.
I'm kind of the old lady around
here.
So, I mean, I do feel a little
on the outsides, but I might be
able to sway Amanda.
 You know, I mean...
 You know?
 You know?
 I think Denise has played a
great game, and I think she's
been one of the most honest
players here.
So it's hard, because I want to
keep her around, but I don't,
because it's more competition to
me in the end.
I just...
This could be, like, my million-
dollar decision tonight.
Someone's going to get a million
dollars.
Two people aren't.
So do you give them that chance
because they deserve it, or do
you pick someone that you feel
you have a better chance
against?
 Amanda holds all the cards
right now.
She can vote with Denise right
now and make it a tie, so right
now my one goal is to get rid of
Denise.
And I'm hoping that Courtney and
Amanda are still on the same
wavelengths as me, and I hope
I'm here on day 39 still.
 Who are you voting for?
 Well, it all depends on
what's going on.
I mean, I would vote for Todd if
I could.
 I'll just tell you the
position I'm in right now, just
so you're fully aware.
Me and Todd had an alliance on
day one.
 Yeah, I understand that.
 You know what I'm saying?
So I'm really at a crossroads,
Denise, because it's like do I
backstab somebody that I've had
an alliance with since the
beginning?
You know what I'm saying?
But this kills me, because I
would rather have you sitting
next to me in final three than
Todd.
I haven't even trusted him this
whole time.
 No, I don't trust him.
Would you consider both of us
voting for Todd and having it be
a tie?
 I have to think about it
more, but I will guarantee you I
will not vote for you tonight.
 Okay.
 But I cannot guarantee what
they will vote.
 At this point in time,
anything's possible.
Anybody could be lying.
I mean, it's hard for me to tell
who lies, who doesn't.
Amanda said she had my back, so
I kind of believe her that she
said she wouldn't write my name
down.
But on the other hand, you never
can tell.
Anything is possible, anything
can happen, and she might.
You know, I really like you,
Amanda.
I really think you're going to
do the right thing.
Well, I mean, when you told me
that you had my back, I really
thought you meant it too, so...
 I did.
 Well, now is when I need you
to prove it.
 Right now in the game my
biggest threat is probably Todd.
Todd has made a lot of personal
connections with a lot of people
on the jury.
The jury is a younger jury, so I
think he's my biggest threat
right now.
I'm at an awful crossroads.
I've been going back and forth
in my head: Denise, Todd,
Denise, Todd.
And they both have their cons.
They both have their pros.
But still I'm still undecided.
I don't know what I'm going to
choose.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury: Jaime,
Jean-Robert, Frosti, James,
Erik, and Peih-Gee, voted out at
the last tribal council.
So let's establish something
right off the bat.
Amanda, is there any chance
you're going to give up
individual immunity tonight?
 No way.
 PROBST: Okay, so we know
Amanda is not going to be voted
out.
It's going to be Denise, Todd,
or Courtney.
Todd, the four of you have been
together from the beginning.
So what are you going to base
your vote on tonight?
 You know, tonight's vote is
probably the hardest vote,
because, like, we have been
together since day one.
And it is coming down to who you
want to pit yourself up against
in the end.
 PROBST: Denise, is it fair to
say, "I want to get rid of the
biggest threat in this game"?
Or does the biggest threat
deserve a shot?
 Well, Jeff, I'm going to base
my vote on how I feel right now.
Because like I said, I'm always
on the bottom of the totem pole.
There are still people that are
in alliances, and it's still
hard to break in even though are
you in.
So, I mean, I have to do what I
got to do tonight because I'm on
the outside.
 PROBST: Courtney, do you feel
that Denise is on the outside?
Is that a known fact?
 Um, I think that everyone's
on the outside of some group.
I mean, I spent the first half
of this game feeling that I was
completely on the outside of
everyone, and a lot of times
that's an insecurity problem
more than a reality.
I mean, it's not necessarily
true or false.
It's, you know, all perception.
 PROBST: Todd, how important
at this point is perception?
You could feel you're on the
outside.
You could feel you're on the
inside.
You really don't know until the
votes are cast.
 Absolutely.
I mean, the only one here
tonight that should feel fine is
Amanda, because she has that
necklace on.
And like you said, until those
votes are read, I'm going to be
sitting here playing with my
fingers, shaking my foot.
 PROBST: So, Todd, as we sit
here right now, you're still not
sure if you're safe or not.
 No, I really am not sure.
I want to think I am and hope I
am, but I've seen a lot happen
on this side of the game.
People thought they were sure,
and they're not.
 PROBST: Courtney, how certain
are you that you'll be okay,
you're going to be in the final?
 I don't think any one of the
three of us is sure about it.
I mean, you got to be pretty
stupid to think you're safe at
this point.
 PROBST: Denise, why does it
make sense to keep you tonight?
 Well, I don't know why
they... they shouldn't vote me
out.
They think because I have kids
I'll have a better influence on
the jury and I'd be sympathetic
to the jury.
So they don't want to keep me
here because they think that
that might weigh on the jury's
minds.
 PROBST: Courtney, why, from a
strategy point of view, would it
make sense to actually keep you
tonight?
 You know, everyone is not
going to be excited for me that
I somehow managed to pull
through.
Like, you know, people are going
to be voting on if you're
strategic from the beginning, if
you're a fan of the game, if you
worked hard on all of the
challenges.
You know, there's definitely
areas where I'm going to come up
a lot shorter than the other
people here.
Oh, and then there's my winning
personality.
I'm sure I've ruffled a few
feathers along the way.
 PROBST: Amanda, was is a busy
afternoon for you?
Were you very popular?
 When you're wearing this,
it's funny how people change as
they... when they act towards
you.
Like, people's attitudes change
when they know that you're not
going home and you have a free
vote that someone here may need.
 PROBST: Denise, is Amanda's
vote more powerful tonight, or
is it just another vote?
 Well, I mean, whoever she
votes for, that could be the
power switch.
I mean, it all depends on which
way she goes.
I mean, I was talking to her
earlier, and at one point, she's
like, "I got your back."
You know, I said, "I got your
back."
And you know, I hope she votes
with me, and I hope she doesn't
vote against me.
 I said I had your back a
while ago.
I didn't say that today.
I said... you know what I said.
 I know, I know, I understand.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Todd, you have the
best grin on your face.
 You know, it was kind of sly
that she said you had your back,
and Amanda's face kind of
dropped like, "I never said I
had your back."
And I was like, "Oh, that's
sharp."
I mean, if it was said to me,
I'd be like, "Mm."
So that's... I was kind of
reacting for Denise, I guess, in
a way.
 PROBST: Amanda, has the final
tribal council already started?
Because Todd just took an
opportunity to make an editorial
comment.
 I know.
It has already begun.
And you just have to put
yourself in what you think is
the best position and do your
best, and that's all you can do.
 PROBST: All right, it is time
to vote.
Cannot vote for Amanda.
Denise, Todd, Courtney, all
three of you are fair game.
It is time to vote.
Denise, you're up.
 Todd, I'm going to have to
vote for you because I know
you're going to vote for me
tonight.
Good luck.
 One of the greatest
competitors in this game so far.
You've been awesome to me.
Thank you.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal
council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Denise.
Todd.
One vote Todd.
Denise.
Two votes Denise.
One vote Todd.
One vote left.
13th person voted out and the
seventh member of our jury,
Denise.
You need to bring me your torch.
Denise, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Amanda, Todd, Courtney, you've
gone as far as you can go in
this game.
The power now shifts to the
jury.
Seven people that you had a hand
in voting out now hold your fate
in their hands.
The only power you have left is
the opportunity to persuade them
it should be you.
You have one night left in
China.
Enjoy it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 I definitely believe I would
have won this entire thing if I
had stayed in the game.
I'm just proud of what I've
accomplished.
I think I did a great job.
I never gave up.
And to make it 38 days out here
is a spectacular thing for a 40-
year-old woman.
 Congratulations, girlies.
We did it.
 Amanda.
 What?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please stop.
Come here.
 What do you have to say to
me, Todd?
Do you want to call me out in
tribal again?
 What do you mean call you
out?
 I'm so over this.
Like, I could not be more over
this.
We just got back from tribal
council, and I feel horrible.
In essence, Todd made me look
bad in front of the jury.
 This is the face that I made.
I went, "Ah," like ouch, burn,
that hurts, but it's true.
 Yeah, exactly.
That's why I'm mad.
Because I was like, "Denise, I
did not say I had your back
today."
And I know how that sounded, but
then you put in that comment.
 You're right.
 Cut me off at the knees.
 I didn't mean it that way.
 Well, that's how it came out.
 I'm sorry.
 Like, I'm not retarded.
I know what happened.
What happened was Denise was
trying to say that I told her
before tribal council that I had
her back, but I definitely don't
think I did it.
I think... I had told her before
that I had her back, but not
today.
And it sounded bad because it
sounded like, "No, I'm in the
not going to have your back
today."
And then Todd made a face like,
"Oh, my God, Amanda."
 I wasn't doing it to backstab
you.
 No, listen to me.
You can totally go in tomorrow
and trash me as much as you
want.
 I'm not going to!
 But I'm saying that's fine,
because I know it's your game.
But don't expect everything to
be, like, okay if you do stuff
like that to me, because I don't
like people like that.
 I didn't...
 I am honestly disappointed
with myself, because I'm in the
final three with a guy who would
stab me in the back in a second
and who has pretty much lied,
cheated his way into the finals
with my help.
So I feel like crap.
 And I honestly mean that.
I did not mean to turn it on
you.
 Yeah, you did.
 No, I didn't!
 That's fine, whatever.
 You don't believe me.
 It really was an accident.
My last intention was to turn it
on to Amanda and make her look
like a bad guy.
So it was a complete slip-up.
And you know, she, I don't
think, believes me that it was
an accident, but it was.
I wish that you wanted to
celebrate, because we're in the
final three together like we
planned.
 I have nothing to celebrate.
I don't feel like I...
I don't know.
You guys can celebrate.
I'm going to bed.
 Day 39.
We made it.
 ...I get to use a Q-Tip.
 Oh, my God!
 Peanut butter, like this.
 Guys, I see something-- a lot
of something, you guys!
 It's like Christmas!
 Ah!
 Yay!
 Ah!
 Looks like we'll be starting
a fire!
We'll be starting a fire!
 Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, what's that?
 There's chicken and eggs
and...
 It's pancake batter.
 All right, this is what we're
going to do.
Carry it back.
We'll eat the pastries and some
of the fruit, and then we'll get
into the hard stuff.
 And then we'll make fire?
 We're cooking, Todd.
Perfect.
We're cooking in a jungle!
 China's been a crazy
experience for me.
I'm glad that, you know, China
was as hard as it was.
Like, it rained.
It was so hot.
You know, it is like a building
experience.
 Cheers to the final three,
girls!
 Who ever would have thought?
 No one.
 Not me.
I'm proud of myself, and I can't
believe it.
Like, my final goal was to make
the final three, and I did.
 Can you guys believe that we
made it this far?
 No.
 The three of us, really.
 I am so happy it's you guys
too.
 Me too.
 Now I'm getting sappy too.
I think I do have really good
personal relationships on the
jury.
I have never been anything but
my own winsome personality that
has been called every name in
the book since day one.
So hopefully... I mean,
hopefully that'll have some
credit.
I made it this far, and that
should get some respect from
some people.
I'm getting full.
 I know.
 It's the most amazing
feeling.
 Let's burn Jean-Robert's $500
Louis Vuittons.
 Louis Vuitton.
Let's do this.
 All right, ready, guys?
 Yeah.
I think the biggest part of
being out here in China is out
here, I have felt more emotions
and thought more about my life
in general than I ever, ever
have.
So I think China has almost
helped me to grow up.
This is for 38 days of suffering
in the jungles of China and to
day 39 where we're the final
three!
Burn!
I feel like, looking at the
jury, I stand an okay shot.
I backstabbed and lied to a lot
of them, but I was playing a
game.
And whether I win a million
dollars tonight or not, I feel
like I've accomplished a lot,
and I'm so proud.
 Honestly, I think it's
anyone's game at this point.
I think I have a 33% chance of
winning, of winning the money.
And I'm just going to go in
tonight, tell them the honest
truth about my game and how I've
played.
I think a lot of my fear of
failure and things like that
have been minimized because of
this experience, and I'm ready
to do it now.
I'm not afraid of it.
I'm nervous for tonight, because
all of this is coming to an end.
I know I'm going to be
emotional.
And... it'll be good.
I'm excited.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Jaime, Jean-Robert, Frosti,
James, Erik, Peih-Gee, and
Denise, voted out at the last
tribal council.
Amanda, Todd, Courtney, welcome
to your final tribal council.
After 39 days, the power now
shifts from the three of you to
the jury.
Tonight they will decide who is
most deserving of the title of
sole survivor and the million-
dollar check that goes with it.
This is your last chance to
convince them you are the one
who is most deserving.
Here's how it's going to work.
You will each get a chance to
make an opening statement.
The jury will then get a chance
to address you.
And then we will vote.
You guys ready to get started?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Opening statements.
Amanda, you're up.
 Okay.
Um, you know, I had a lot of
time to reflect on the
experience, the whole experience
today, and I feel very blessed
to be sitting here.
This was a hard 39 days.
And it's finally come to an end.
And I came into this game
knowing a specific strategy
that I was going to follow and
that I had to align myself with
someone right away.
So I aligned with Todd.
My strategy then changed, like,
towards the end game, so I was
with people that I had a chance
to physically compete against.
And I did.
I won the last two immunity
challenges.
But there are some things I'm
not proud of that I've done.
You know, I voted for some
people that didn't think that I
was going to vote for them-- you
know, specifically James, Jean-
Robert, and Frosti.
I am sorry if I hurt your
feelings, and I really respect
playing with all of you.
So... that's all I have to say.
 PROBST: Todd.
 All right, guys.
I'm stoked to be here tonight,
and you know, the first thing I
want to say really is thank you
for being where you are and
helping me to get in this spot
in the game.
I know that I played a game
where I had to lie and I had to
backstab and I had to hurt
people that I cared about.
And the main thing I can ask
tonight is that you are able to
see the difference between my
strategic game and the relations
that I actually built with you,
because the relations on a
personal level-- honest, real.
The game level, the strategic
level is what I came here to do.
I knew coming in the game I was
not the most physical, but I
knew that I could be the most
strategic, and if I did that, I
could get here.
This is my dream come true.
I've lived my dream, and you
know, you guys have all been a
part of it.
And I'm happy to answer whatever
questions, hear whatever you
have to say about me.
I'm ready for it.
But I really do want to say
thank you for helping me in the
game.
It means the world to me.
So thanks.
 PROBST: Courtney.
 Okay.
Hello, everyone.
Unlike the other two people
sitting here, I was not a
lifelong Survivor fan.
No strategy.
No idea what I was doing.
And every single time that I
didn't get voted out, I was
actually surprised.
So that's what sets me apart
from these two guys.
I figured out how to survive in
a game that was completely
physical in the beginning.
I started the game weighing 95
pounds, and I was physically
scared to be in this game in the
beginning.
I had to figure out a way to
just somehow manage to make it
work for me, and I did that.
Around the time of the merge,
things changed, and I sort of
got my footing a little bit
better.
I did win a personal immunity.
So whoever saw that coming?
Not me.
I was surprised.
I made good alliances that
worked for me.
I was always pretty up front, as
much as you can be in this
scenario.
And I'm really proud of myself.
And it think that, you know,
whether or not you not you like
me personally, you have to give
a little bit of credit to the
little girl who everyone thought
would be gone in the first six
days and is still sitting here
on day 39.
 PROBST: All right, jury, in a
minute, you're going to get your
first chance to address Amanda,
Todd, and Courtney.
I'll give you a minute to think
about what you want to say.
 PROBST: All right, jury, it
is now your opportunity to
address Amanda, Todd, and
Courtney.
This is your chance to gain the
information you need to make a
million-dollar decision.
You can address one, two, or all
three of them.
James, you're up first.
 All right, I just want to
congratulate you all.
You did what you all were
supposed to do.
You made it to the final three.
I'm not even going to be a
bitter betty.
Courtney, I just want to know
something good, so just a good
time that y'all had in the game
of Survivor?
 I think one of the best times
I had was actually the very
first challenge that our team
did together, because when I
picked up the pole the first
time, I was like, "Sweet mother
of God, this thing weighs 50
pounds; I'm going to die."
And then when we actually won it
in the end and I stuck the thing
in, I was like, "I'm not going
to be the first person voted out
of Survivor!
Oh, my God!
This is crazy!"
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: James, I have a
question for you.
Why that question?
 Well, I mean, I just wanted
to make it easier, because it
might be kind of rough in a
little while.
I'm not bitter betty.
 PROBST: Thanks, James.
J.R., Jean-Robert, you're up.
 Congratulations, guys.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 But I got a dilemma.
I have a real problem here.
From day one, it hasn't been a
secret that I haven't really
felt like Courtney is
necessarily deserving of getting
to the end, but I also promised
Todd and I promised Amanda that
if you guys backstab me, you
would not be winning a million
dollars.
So here I am.
( laughter )
Okay, can it be anyone besides
you three?
But it's the three of you.
Okay, now I have to make a
decision.
So I got to tell you, tonight,
my vote is live for any of you.
I'm asking you, Courtney, how
can I, in good conscience, give
you my vote tonight?
 The game is outwit, outlast,
outplay, and I have done all
three of those things.
And you know, I won an immunity.
Like, that... did you win an
immunity?
I came from the worst odds.
I was never the favorite in this
game.
 I agree with that.
 There you go.
 Thanks, that's a good answer.
By the way, I started out this
game with the strategy of being
a brutal jerk and was going to
try and come around.
The second half of my game never
got into play because I was
blindsided, which brings me to
Amanda.
Day 23.
I went to you, and I said,
"Amanda, I will not backstab
you."
At that point, you said to me,
"I will not be putting your name
down on a ballet."
That's what you said to me on
day 23.
 Uh-huh.
 Day 24 comes around, my
name's on a ballot.
I'm asking you, when you said
that to me, were you outright
lying to me, or did you make a
commitment to me and just go
back on your word?
 I was not lying to you.
And honestly, I did not want to
vote for you.
But too many other people did.
So honestly, it was a very, very
hard decision for me.
It's not one I'm proud of.
And I am sorry for lying to you.
 So you lied to me.
First you're saying you broke
your word to me.
Now you're saying I lied to you.
What happened there?
 No, I broke the word to you.
I didn't lie to you.
I did not want to put your name
down.
 Okay.
 But I am telling you I was
between a rock and a hard place.
I had no choice.
 Todd, day one, I went to you
and said, "Todd, you know what?
You're the schemer here.
I know it.
I'm on to you.
You have the knowledge, and you
have the smarts."
We had a plan to send James
home.
The best move for all of us at
that time was to get rid of
James, okay?
In my opinion, you organizing to
blindside me-- yeah, you
blindsided me.
Okay, I'm out of the game.
But I wasn't the biggest threat.
 You started to strategically
place ideas in people's heads,
which is what I wanted my job to
be.
And when you had approached me
about blindsiding James, I was
like, "Oh, no, he is catching
up."
So who then becomes the biggest
threat to me?
You.
What do I have to do?
Turn it around on you, who is an
extremely great, strategic
player in your daily life.
I had to get rid of my biggest
strategic threat, who was you.
 Guys, congratulations.
Well done.
( laughter )
That was a good answer.
( laughter )
 PROBST: James, I'm confused.
What are you laughing at?
 I mean, he shut his mouth.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Peih-Gee, you're up.
 All right, I want to vote for
the person that I think deserves
it the most.
Todd, you talked about having
played a really strategic game.
You say that you played it hard.
You know, I want to know that
you didn't just slide in here
because somebody decided you
were going to be easy to beat.
 First, I didn't slide
anywhere.
I started working day one.
Jean-Robert called me out and
said I'm a sneaky, sly little
bastard that was going to get
through this game and he had to
watch out for.
He was right.
Second, I gathered my numbers.
I got myself Amanda.
I got myself Courtney, right?
I was like, "Good, I've got some
numbers."
Pulled in Denise.
We get to the merge, we pick you
guys off, then it's a head-to
battle, but I still got my
numbers.
I fought.
It's a glorious battle, art of
war, yin and yang.
I came out as a fighter.
That's just bottom line.
 Amanda, I'm sick of you
looking at me with doe eyes, and
every time you've opened your
mouth to any one of these
people, you sound apologetic.
 Okay.
 Because you wanted Todd to
take the fall as the bad guy,
you know?
I want to hear what you think
you did that was better than
what Todd did.
 Part of my strategy in this
game was making sure that I was
with people in the end that I
could physically compete
against.
James is a physical competitor.
He had two immunity idols.
That is a guaranteed spot in the
top five.
So I said let's... you know,
"What about if we just... you
know, we have to get rid of
James.
It's either now or never,
because he could pull out six,
and he could pull out five, and
then he's in the top four, and
then he's in the top three spot,
and then there's only places for
two of us."
 Uh-huh.
 So that is the most strategic
move that I made in this game.
 So the decision to get rid of
James was your idea.
 It was my idea.
 All right, cool.
 PROBST: Thanks, Peih-Gee.
Erik.
 I want to know what was the
riskiest move you made in the
game where you knew that it was
your ass if you didn't.
Amanda, let's hear from you.
 Definitely I think my
riskiest move in this game was
the decision to get rid of
James, and I really believed
that Todd and James had
something going on.
And you know, if James got in
there, he was going to not only
take a third spot, but wreck my
alliance that I already had.
So that was definitely the
riskiest move from my strategic
play in this game.
 I'm just trying to
understand.
 Okay.
 Like, voting out a guy with
two immunity idols does not
sound very risky to me.
It sounds like a no-brainer.
 If he would have played an
idol, I would have lost my
alliance partner, and then I
would have had to start all over
again.
So it was a very risky move.
We were all nervous at that
tribal council.
It would have changed the whole
game if something else would
have happened.
 All right.
Well, I think I've got what I
need to know.
Thank you, guys.
 PROBST: Thanks, Erik.
Frosti, you're up.
 Todd, you know, I love you,
but I don't even know if I know
you.
You lied up, down, left, and
right and all the way back
around in circles.
Why do you think that your game
play deserves a vote from
Frosti?
 I think you're a great kid.
My personal relations were
different than my game
relations.
And yes, I did know that I
wanted to take you in, be close
with you, make myself a buddy,
and put you on a jury.
And what I built with you as a
friend was real.
But yeah, I did do a big, huge
lie to my buddy Frosti.
I'm sorry.
 All right.
Hey.
Courtney, what's up?
How you doing?
You look great.
 Thanks.
I dressed up for you.
 Now, I am really interested
to hear what you have to say,
because I think of all the three
people, your game play
interested me the most.
Amanda, I assumed, was going to
lie and backstab me eventually.
Todd, I knew, was going to lie
and backstab me eventually.
But you, actually, interestingly
enough, surprised me when you
lied, backstabbed me just a
little bit.
You also flat out said to me,
unprovoked, that if my name came
up with other people, you would
tell me.
 Um, no, everyone was in a
blind, panicked frenzy that I
wouldn't vote for you.
So all eyes were sort of on me,
and, I mean, if I pulled you
aside, you know, it might have
made you feel a little bit
better or a little bit worse,
but I don't... I mean, I don't
know that it would have changed
any outcome.
But it wasn't like I went out
and aggressively befriended you
just to take you out of the game
and then like, "Oh, good, pocket
juror."
That's just... that's not what
happened.
 Thanks, guys.
 PROBST: Jaime, you're up.
 Hi, guys.
 Hi!
 I have a kind of fun question
where you guys get to pull each
other's dirty laundry out for
the other people.
I don't want it sugarcoated.
So, Courtney, I'm going to start
with you.
If you could start off by
telling me everything that we
would be disappointed in Todd
about knowing and what he's
done, what lies he's told, why
we shouldn't vote for him but we
should vote for you.
 I think airing Todd's dirty
laundry is pretty redundant.
I think he wears it on his
sleeve.
I think every single person here
knows exactly every bad thing
that Todd's done, and that's why
you're sitting over there.
 But what has he done?
 Um, well, he organized voting
out Jean-Robert, and then he
organized voting out Frosti, and
then he helped Amanda with
voting out James.
I mean, there's not really
specifics.
 So he deserves the million
dollars more than you do?
Is that what you're saying?
 I think that each one of us
has a different reason that we
are deserving, and that's...
 Exactly, but why is he not
deserving?
 I think he might be
deserving.
I think it's an equal
opportunity.
 So Todd should get my
million-dollar vote?
 If that's the way you...
 Okay, Todd, we're going to
skip that question to Courtney
and go why doesn't Courtney
deserve the million dollars?
What has she done?
 Courtney's voted the same as
me pretty much the whole time.
I mean, I may have made the lies
up and coordinated them.
She's voted with me, so she's
just as much of a liar as I am.
 Except I didn't lie to you
all.
I just went along.
 She just went along.
That's it.
 Not vote for her!
 The reason why you should not
vote for Courtney...
 Yes.
 ...is because she didn't want
to be here in the first place.
 So do you think she deserves
it at all or do you think...
 I think I deserve it more
than her.
 Okay, great.
Now, Amanda, is there anything
about Courtney that we should
know that makes her undeserving
of a million dollars?
 I'm just going to be honest.
I came into this and...
 I don't want...
 I know.
 Okay.
 I feel like Courtney is
ungrateful.
When she'd come back from
rewards, she'd just complain.
And I... honestly, at the
beginning, I didn't feel like
Courtney deserved to be here
because I didn't feel like she
put her heart into anything she
did here.
And that's just honest.
 Okay.
What about Todd?
 Um, I feel like Todd is a
great strategic player of this
game, but I feel if he's that
good of a strategic player, why
didn't he play this game better
to where he didn't have to
deceive and lie to all these
people?
He lied too much for me.
 I don't know if I'd make an
alliance...
 Okay, now, Todd, this is your
chance.
 Right.
 You just heard what Amanda
said about you.
Do you... first of all, is what
she said legit, or was there
strategics behind you lying?
 I mean, yeah, I told more
lies, and yeah, I made more, you
know, like, "Let's go far
togethers" than Amanda.
But I did the dirty work for the
nice girl.
 And Courtney, do you think
she rode your coattail and the
only reason she's here is
because of you?
 I would say that they
definitely played their game
strategically, but I played mine
more strategically.
 Okay, that's fair enough.
 PROBST: Thanks, Jaime.
Denise, you're up.
 I'm glad y'all can look me in
the eye.
That's nice.
I'm just up here.
I mean, I'm a lunch lady.
I dedicate my whole life to
being honest, to being fair.
You guys all came up to me.
You all shook my hand.
You all looked me in the face.
You all said, "You're with us."
None of you wanted to be
standing up next to me.
You didn't want to go up there.
You thought I would play the kid
game.
I believe that the jury would
have voted for me.
But because I'm standing here
and I'm not sitting over there,
someone has to give it to you
now.
So this is what I'm going to do.
Amanda has lied, even though she
said that "I don't lie.
I'm not going to lie.
I'm an honorable person."
You have lied.
You have not only lied to me.
You've lied to Jean-Robert.
You've lied to Frosti.
You've lied to James.
Todd, he has such a deceptive
side to him that, you know, you
never know when he's telling the
truth.
You know, if you have these
things in you that you can do
that to people without even
thinking about it, without ever
batting an eye, your conscience
needs to be cleaned.
You need to turn over a new
leaf.
You need to look inside yourself
as well and realize what you do
that affects a lot of people.
Courtney, you're a very honest
person.
You're very outgoing.
You say what you mean.
You mean what you say.
I can respect that.
 Thanks, guys.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: All right, jury,
you've had your say.
Amanda, Todd, Courtney, you've
had your say.
Let me give you a minute to let
it all sink in, and then we will
vote.
 PROBST: All right, Amanda,
Todd, Courtney, you've made your
case to the jury.
The jury's had their chance to
address you.
One thing left to do, and that
is vote.
Jury, tonight, you are voting
for a winner.
You are writing down the name of
the person you think most
deserving of the title of sole
survivor and the million-dollar
check that goes with it, the
last time it is time to vote.
Jaime, you're up.
 You did not have my vote
coming into this.
I'm very impressed with your
answers this evening, and that's
why you got my vote.
So congratulations.
 I relate to your struggle
with being honest in this game.
I think you played the best,
well-rounded game.
So congratulations, wish you the
best.
 Courtney, I picked you
because you always tried to tell
me the truth and you overcame
the most odds.
Good job.
Congratulations.
 You just stole a million
dollars.
Well played.
 PROBST: I'll go get the
votes.
Amanda, Todd, Courtney, it's
been a long 39 days.
I know you'd like me to read
these votes tonight.
And I'm going to, because we are
live in Hollywood for the
reading of the votes!
( cheering and applause )
All right!
Thank you!
Amanda, Todd, Courtney, jury,
thank you for being a part of
what I think was a very good
season of Survivor, one of our
best, I would say.
( cheering and applause )
Yeah.
Now let's get to the reason you
all signed up for this adventure
in the first place, the shot at
a million dollars.
Tonight, these votes are for a
winner.
Tonight, you want to see your
name on the parchment.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Courtney.
Amanda.
One vote Amanda, one vote
Courtney.
Todd.
We're tied up, one vote each.
Courtney.
Two votes Courtney, one vote
Todd, one vote Amanda.
Todd.
We're tied again, two votes
Courtney, two votes Todd, one
vote Amanda.
Todd.
That's three votes Todd, two
votes Courtney, one vote Amanda,
one vote left.
That means, Amanda, you're out
of it.
You can no longer win.
One vote left.
This vote will either force a
tie between Todd and Courtney,
or it will produce a winner.
I'll read the last vote.
Winner of Survivor: China, Todd.
( cheering and applause )
