        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": THIS IS "SURVIVOR:
DAVID VS. GOLIATH."
THE 37th SEASON BEGAN WITH
AN UPSET.
DAVID WINS EARLY REWARD!
AT THE GOLIATH TRIBE, BAN FELL
FOR KARA.
AND DISCOVERED AN IDOL.
HEY, GUYS, GUYS, I FOUND AN
IDOL WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
GIRLS IN THIS WHOLE ENTIRE GAME.
Jeff: AT THE DAVID TRIBE,
NICK FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OUTS.
BUT MOTHER NATURE INTERVENED,
AND PAT WAS MEDICALLY EVACUATED.
WE LOVE YOU, PAT!








WE LOVE YOU, PAT.
THIS IS JUST A HUGE LOSS.
Jeff: THREE DAYS IN, DOWN
ONE TRIBE MEMBER, BUT WE ARE
EARLY IN THIS GAME.
THE FIGHT AINT OVER.
Jeff: THE GAME CONTINUES
ON.
19 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THE
FIRE GOING.
DO WE HAVE DRY WOOD?
HOW ON EARTH WOULD ANYTHING
BE DRY HERE?
AND IF SO, WHERE WOULD IT BE?
IT REALLY TOOK IT OUT OF US.
TODAY WAS ROUGH.








PAT WAS KIND OF ALWAYS THE MORAL
BOOSTER AROUND CAMP.
AND TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIM KIND
OF JUST KNOCKED US ALL DOWN.
ITS TOO WET.
YEAH.
ITS COMING DOWN.
THE RAINS COMING DOWN NOW.
WELL TRY IT IN THE MORNING.
♪ ♪
♪ ♪
LIGHT!
COME ON!
I AM SO-- IM JUST OVER IT.
SINCE WE STARTED THIS GAME,
WE HAVE JUST BEEN IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF BEING WET, COLD, AND
ITS CRUSHING.
BECAUSE IT ALMOST FEELS
SOMETIMES LIKE IS THE END IN
SIGHT?
I JUST WANT A FIRE SO BAD.
YOU WANT TO DO IT NOW?
YEAH, IT SLOWED DOWN A BIT.
IF YOU DONT MIND BEING IN
THE RAIN.
CHRISTIAN, I CAN HELP YOU.
IM NOT IN THE LOOP ON THE
DECISION MAKING.
ME, NEITHER.
WE WERE ABOUT TWO HOURS AWAY
FROM HAVING A TRIBAL, AND I HAD
NO IDEA.
NOBODYS EVER COME TO ME.
RIGHT, DUDE, I KNOW I WAS THE
ONE.
THATS REALLY BAD.
IM GLAD WE DIDNT GO TO
TRIBAL BECAUSE THE PLAN WAS TO
VOTE OUT NICK WHICH I DIDNT
WANT TO LOSE NICK.
I DIDNT WANT TO VOTE HIM OUT AT
ALL.
I ACTUALLY LIKE HIM A LOT
PERSONALLY.
WE GET ALONG WELL.
AND THE FACT THAT WE DIDNT HAVE
TO HAVE A VOTE MEANS WE CAN HAVE
THIS AMBIGUITY OF ALLIANCES
STILL.
WHEREAS, ONCE WE DO VOTE, THATS
WHEN ITS CLEAR CUT.
THATS WHEN WE KNOW WHERE
EVERYONE STANDS.
I FEEL BOTTOM LINE ONE OF THE
GIRLS HAS TO GO.
ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
AWESOME.
NOW WE CAN HURRY UP.
WERE ON THE SAME PAGE.
EACH NEW DAY I GET OUT HERE IS A
BLESSING, BECAUSE I WAS ONLY
SUPPOSED TO GET THREE.
SO IM EITHER GOING TO WIN OR
IM GOING TO DIE TRYING.
IVE ALWAYS FELT THE CONNECTION
WITH CHRISTIAN, YOU KNOW, WERE
LIKE J.P. AND STEPHEN.
J.T. WAS LIKE A COUNTRY BOY FROM
ALABAMA AND STEPHEN WAS LIKE A
GENIUS.
IM GOING TO FLIP IT.
PUT IT DOWN FOR A SECOND.
ONE SECOND.
LET ME ROTATE IT AND TRY.
OKAY, GO AHEAD, LIFT IT UP.
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE REALLY
HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER,
SO I THINK ITS TIME FOR SOME
MORE ALLIANCE MAKING.
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH,
LIKE, AN ALLIANCE NAME.
AN ALLIANCE NAME?
YEAH.
SO YOU ARE FROM KENTUCKY AND
YOURE BALTIMORE.
WE COULD BE THE-- WE COULD BE
THE MASON-DIXON LINE.
THE MASON-DIXON LINE RUNS RIGHT
OVER THE TOP.
THATS A GOOD ALLIANCE NAME.
TEAM MASON-DIXON.
VIRTUAL FIST BUMP.
I THINK MASON-DIXON IS HERE
FOR THE LONG HAUL.
HEY, GUYS!
WE HAVE TREE MAIL AND A
PRESENT.
OKAY.
"DAVID TRIBE, IT HAS BEEN A
TOUGH AND UNUSUALLY WET FIRST
FEW DAYS.
SURVIVING THE ELEMENTS IS A PART
OF THE "SURVIVOR" ADVENTURE, BUT
THIS UNRELENTING STORM HAS
PROHIBITED YOU TO MAKE THE FIRE
YOU EARNED.
THIS FIRE-MAKING KIT SHOULD
HELP."
( APPLAUSE ).
AWESOME!
"THIS FIRE-MAKING KIT SHOULD
HELP."
YAY!
"AND AS A GESTURE OF GOOD
WELL IM OFFERING THIS TARP AS
PROTECTION.
GOOD LUCK.
JEFF."
OH, MY GOD!
YUP, YUP,IUM.
HOLD ON.
DONT DOUSE IT.
DONT DOUBT IT.
A LITTLE BIT, A LITTLE BIT.
ITS GOING, ITS GOING.
WE ARE IN BUSINESS NOW, GUYS.
LIFE IS GOLDEN RIGHT NOW.
IVE GOT SHELTER, FIRE, IDOL IN
MY JACKET, RICE IN MY BELLY,
KARA BY MY SIDE EVERY SINGLE
NIGHT.
IM LIVING THE DREAM LIFE RIGHT
NOW.
WHERE DID YOU PUT MY JACKET?
ON A TREE OVER THERE.
SHE IS TERRIFIED THAT
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GO DIGGING
IN MY JACKET AND FIND THAT IDOL.
IM LIKE, "LISTEN, GIRL, NOBODY
IS GOING TO EXPECT MY IDOL IS
GOING TO BE IN AN OBVIOUS SPOT."
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW
ABOUT MY IDOL ARE NATALIA AND
KARA.
DEFINITELY TWO, TOO MANY, BUT
THE ONE PERSON I CAN ABSOLUTELY
TRUST IN THIS GAME I FEEL LIKE
IS TARA.
WELL, YEAH.
OKAY.
I KNOW.
JUST A REMINDER.
I GOT IT.
OKAY.
ITS REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE
IN AN ALLIANCE WITH DAN BECAUSE
HES SO OBVIOUS ABOUT IT.
I THINK DAN IS IN A
SHOWMANCE.
I THINK KARAS IN A STRATEGY.
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE TO THEIR
DEMISE BECAUSE SHOWMANCES,
WHETHER THEYRE REAL OR NOT,
THEY DONT WORK.
IN MY MIND, KARAS PLAYING
DAN.
SHES BEEN CHARMING HIM EVER
SINCE WE GOT ON THIS DAMN
ISLAND.
I THINK HES BLINDED BY KARAS
GOOD LOOKS.
ITS LIKE, BAD MOVE, BROTHER,
BAD MOVE.
I HAVE TO PROTECT MYSELF.
TWO PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT SO
EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE LOYAL TO
EACH OTHER, IT NEVER GOES WELL.
SO NOW IM SCRAMBLING TO LET THE
GIRLS KNOW, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IM
HERE TO PLAY.
IM HERE FOR YOUR LOYALTY.
AND IM REALLY PRAYING THAT THEY
CAN SEE THAT.
DUDE, I--
 HERES MY IDEA-- THERE ARE
THREE OF US.
OKAY.
YOUVE GOT ALEC.
I FEEL LIKE HES MY BABY.
WHAT THE HELL!
( LAUGHTER )
 IVE GOT JOHN.
YOU KNOW IM DOWN.
I MEAN THAT, LIKE.
ME, TOO.
LIKE, SINCERELY.
YOUVE GOT DAN.
YES!
YES!
OH, MY GOSH.
BUT ITS LIKE CASUAL ENOUGH--
YOURS IS A LITTLE MORE OBVIOUS,
BUT ITS NOT A LIABILITY YET.
WELL TAKE CARE OF IT.
WITH THAT, WE CAN DECIDE THE
FIRST FOUR OUT.
HALF THE GROUP IS SPENT ON MIKE.
DAN REALLY WANTS TO GET MIKE
OUT.
MIKE IS NOT PUBLIC ENEMY ONE
OR TWO FOR ME.
I KNOW.
HOLD THIS.
DONT LOSE IT.
AND DONT STAB IT IN YOUR FOOT.
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY,
TOO, IN THE SENSE HE WOULD LIKE
TO STICK WITH US.
I THINK NATALIE FIRST BECAUSE
IT MAKES THE TRIBE FEEL UNIFIED.
WE REALLY ARE THREE GOLIATHS.
US THREE GIRLS ARE CLEARLY IN
CHARGE, AND WE KNOW IT, AND WE
HAVE THESE BOYS WRAPPED AROUND
OUR FINGERS.
AND WEVE WE HAVE DANS IDOL IN
OUR BACK POCKET.
THE FACT THAT ME AND KARA ARE
THE ONLY ONES THAT KNOW ABOUT IT
MEANS WE HOLD THE POWER.
I AM PLAYING THE GAME THE
HARDEST.
I WILL GO THROUGH ANYBODYS
STUFF AT ANY TIME, YOU KNOW,
WITHIN REASON.
MIKE THERE WAS, AND HE WAS
LOOKING OUT FOR ME.
AND GOING THROUGH DANS THINGS,
I UNWRAPPED HIS SOCK, AND I SAW
THE IDOL.
AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME AND I
CLOSED IT.
IM NOT SURPRISED THAT DANS
IDOL WAS EASILY FOUND.
IN HIS CLOTHING, BECAUSE HES
PLAYING WITH HIS HEART AND NO
STRATEGY.
SMART PEOPLE DONT LEAVE IT IN
THEIR STUFF AND THEY HIDE IT.
HE HAS THE IDOL.
I DONT THINK HES THAT SMART.
DONT KNOW HOW TO USE IT.
I GOT IN TROUBLE THE VERY
FIRST DAY FOR RUNNING OFF AND
LOOKING FOR AN IMMUNITY IDOL,
AND NOW THE FACT THAT JEREMY
TRUST MEAS SO MUCH THAT HES
TELLING ME AND SHOWING ME ALL OF
THESE SECRETS GAVE ME A NEW LIFE
IN THE GAME.
IVE SEEN THE PAPER.
IT WAS A REAL IDOL.
DO YOU THINK HE TOLD ANYONE?
I THINK HE TOLD KARA.
DAN MAY THINK HES STROJ AND
POWERFUL BECAUSE HE HAS THE
IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT, ACTUALLY, IN
THIS GAME, INFORMATION IS THE
ADVANTAGE.
AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION IS
PROBABLY MORE POWERFUL THAN THE
IDOL ITSELF.
♪ ♪
 AFTER I CAME BACK WITH THE
OCTOPUS, I GOT A LOT OF PRAISE,
A LOT OF, "THANKS, DAVIE, THIS
IS GREAT."
SO I KIND OF JUST DECIDED TO
FALL INTO IT, MAN.
AND I THINK THATS MY ROLE HERE,
JUST BEING A PROVIDER.
A LIZARD.
OH, YOU GOT HIM!
YOU GOT HIM?
OOOH!
I KNOW I WANTED TO LEAVE MY
MARK ON THIS GAME, AND I THINK
IM GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH.
MY MOM GAVE ME THIS CROSS.
YOU KNOW, IVE BEEN PRAYING TO
GOD THAT SOMETHING STANDS OUT,
SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP ME IN
THE GAME.
I LITERALLY HAVE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR FOOD HARDER THAN I HAVE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR ANYTHING ELSE, BUT
MY RISE ALWAYS SURVEYING THE
PREMES SEZ NINJA STYLE, JUST,
LIKE, ALWAYS LOOKING.
THIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE.
WHAT IS THAT?
STRING.
STRING.
COME ON!
OH, JUST SMELLING IT, IT
SMELLS LIKE AN IDOL.
LIKE, IVE NEVER SEEN AN IDOL
BEFORE BUT THIS IS AUTHENTIC,
MAN.
THIS IS AUTHENTIC IDOL LEATHER.
OR I LOVE THIS.
OH, IM LOVING THIS MOMENT RIGHT
NOW.
THANK YOU, GOD.
THE SCREWS ARE TURNING, MAN.
IM ALREADY READY TO PUT THIS
THING TO USE WHEN ITS TIME.
THERE WE GO, NICE PLACE THERE.
AND WERE OFF.
COULD YOU DO ME A HUGE FAVOR
AND HELP ME PULL OFF MY SHIRT?
ITS VERY TIGHT.
THANKS SO MUCH.
IT SHOULD GET EASIER BEFORE
WE GO ALONG.
BEFORE THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, THE WHOLE TRIBE WAS
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH VOTING
NICK OUT.
I MEAN, HE WAS PAROCHIAL.
AND THEN THE WHOLE INCIDENT TOOK
PLACE WITH PAT AND THAT JUST
KIND OF THREW EVERYTHING INTO A
WHIRLWIND.
YOU GET RID OF ALL YOUR STRONG
PEOPLE FIRST, AND WHAT CHANCES
DO YOU HAVE AT EVEN COMING CLOSE
TO WINNING A CHALLENGE?
SO, BASICALLY, WE KNOW WHO WE
WANT FIRST.
WHO DO YOU THINK?
IM THINKING LYRSA.
OVERALL, I THINK SHES THE
WEAKEST.
I REALLY DONT THINK SHES GOING
TO BE ABE TO HELP US IN
CHALLENGES.
WE NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE
STRONG FOR CHALLENGES ANYWAY
BECAUSE THEYRE MASSIVE OVER
THERE.
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE
NUMBERS ON THE VOTE.
SHES OUR WEAKNESS.
SO, THEREFORE, IF WE END UP IN
TRIBAL, MY VOTE IS GOING TO GO
FOR HER.
LYRSAS NAME HAS DEFINITELY
GONE AROUND BECAUSE CARL IS
WANTING TO KEEP THE TRIBE
STRONG.
IT DOESNT QUITE ADD UP TO ME
BECAUSE SHE DOESNT QUITE SEEM
LIKE THE WEAKEST FEMALE IN CAMP.
AS LONG AS WERE ALL GOOD.
YEAH, NO, IM GOOD, IM GOOD
WITH IT.
FOR REAL.
BUT WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR BEST
BUDDYS NAME THROWN OUT, YOU
AINT GOING TO JUST SIT DOWN
IDLY AND DO NOTHING.
YOU GOTTA, LIKE, GET INTO GEAR.
CARL WAS LIKE I THINK LYRSA
IS THE WEAKEST GIRL WE HAVE TO
BE STRONG.
AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH."
I DONT THINK IM THE WEAKEST
GIRL.
WE HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT THERE
BECAUSE I WON IT.
IM JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
WHAT IM HEARING.
CARL SAYING THEY SHOULD VOTE
ME OUT BECAUSE IM THE WEAKEST
PERSON IN THE TRIBE.
UH, EXCUSE ME.
IM THE WEAKEST PERSON?
WHO THE... WON THE FIRST
CHALLENGE?
ME!
SO I DONT THINK IM THE WEAKEST
PERSON HERE.
I MIGHT NOT BE AS ATHLETIC AS
SOME OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I DONT
THINK IM THE WEAKEST ONE.
IM HOPING TO WIN TOMORROW.
ME, TOO.
SO IM FRUSTRATED AT CARL, AND I
REALLY WANT TO CONFRONT HIM.
BUT THIS IS A GAME THAT YOU
CANNOT DO THAT, BECAUSE THEN
YOURE SCREWED.
BUT IM PRETTY PISSED OFF.
I WANT TO VOTE CARL OUT!
( LAUGHTER )
 THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I GOT ONE!
OW!
GET THAT THING OFF!
GET IT OFF!
GET IT OFF!
GET IT OFF!
WOOO!
JEREMYS SITTING THERE NAKED.
OH, SHOOT!
( LAUGHTER )
 AND MY TEETH?
CLEAN.
EVERYBODYS HAVING FUN HERE
24/7.
BOOINGERS IN MY TEETH.
THATS A FIRST.
BUT ITS REALLY CHILDISH AND
HOLLY-LIKE, SO, NO, IM NOT
DOING THAT.
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE
SHELTER.
I THINK WE NEED TO PROBABLY
TAKE THOSE PRAWNS OFF.
I MEAN, IF THE WEATHER STAYS
LIKE THIS, I MEAN, THATS GOING
TO BE PERFECTLY FINE.
( LAUGHS )
THE GOLIATH TRIBE DOES HAVE A
LOT OF WORK TO DO, BUT IVE BEEN
DEALING WITH IT.
AND STRATEGICALLY, MY GAME IS TO
LAY LOW, GET ALONG WITH
EVERYBODY.
AND I THINK ITS WORKING OUT.
UNLESS THEYRE ALL LYING TO ME,
WHICH I DOUBT.
EVERYBODYS DOGGING NATALIE
HARD.
YEAH.
YEAH.
I FEEL BAD FOR HER, MAN.
I DONT THINK SHE EVEN KNOWS,
LIKE, HOW ITS PERCEIVED.
HOW ITS COMING ACROSS.
ITS LIKE SOCIAL AWARENESS.
YOU PAINT YOURSELF IN A
CORNER AS A BAD GUY WHEN YOU DO
STUFF LIKE THAT.
MOST OF THE TRIBE WOULD LIKE
TO SEE NATALIE GO, BUT FOR ME,
PERSONALLY, I LIKE THE IDEA OF
WORKING WITH NATALIE, BECAUSE IT
SEEMS LIKE AN ALLIANCE THAT NO
ONE WOULD SUSPECT.
I WANT HER TO TRUST ME AND TO
HELP ME OUT DEEPER INTO THE
GAME.
DID HE SAY IT WAS ME?
YEAH.
DONT SAY NOTHING.
OKAY.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT
THE OLD LADY?
I FEEL LIKE THEYRE PLAYING LIKE
A BUNCH OF AMATEURS, AND IF IF
ITS ME, IM NOT GOING TO GO OUT
QUIETLY.
SO I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE SENIOR
CITIZEN IN THE GAME WHO DOESNT
HAVE A SNOWBALLS HELLS CHANCE
OF WINNING IS THE FIRST TARGET
TO GO OUT?
SO I UNDERSTAND YOUVE ABANDONED
ME.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR
YOU WHENEVER EVERYBODY ELSE IS
TELLING ME ITS YOU?
HOW IS THE OLDEST PERSON IN
THE DAMN TRIBE THE BIGGEST
THREAT?
IM DAMN NEAR 60.
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU STAND,
BECAUSE THINGS ARE ABOUT TO
HAPPEN, AND IM NOT THE BIGGEST
THREAT TO WIN THIS GAME.
I DONT THINK THERE ARE ANY
NUMBERS TO CHANGE VOTE.
I LIKE TO SAY IM ASSERTIVE.
SOME PEOPLE SAY ITS AGGRESSIVE,
OH, WELL.
I THINK THEYRE ARGUING ABOUT
SOMETHING.
WE ALL JUST--
 IM NOT GOING TO WAIT TO MAKE
THINGS HAPPEN.
IM GOING TO PUSH THINGS ALONG,
AND IT IT MAKES PEOPLE
UNCOMFORTABLE, TOO BAD.
IM NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A
FIGHT, WITHOUT SOME TRICKS, SO
WELL SEE.
BUT DONT THINK I AINT GONNA
DROP A LITTLE NATALIE NAPALM
BEFORE ITS OVER.
SHES JUST FREAKING OUT.
WHO?
NATALIE.
SHES CRAZY.
SHES MAKING HERSELF THE
TARGET.
IF WE COULD HAVE PEACE, OH,
PEACE IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.
NATALIE, NATALIE, NATALIE.
WHAT SHES DOING IS NOT HELPING
HER CASE.
IM THE ONLY ONE TO TRY TO GET
SOME REAL-LIFE ADVICE.
IM A LAWYER.
I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH
DIFFICULT PEOPLE.
HERES THE ISSUE: IM NOT A
PSYCHOLOGIST.
AND I AINT GETTING PAID FOR
THIS.
THERES A LACK OF SELF-AWARENESS
THAT YOU HAVE.
OKAY.
ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY AND
THE WAY YOU TALK TO PEOPLE.
RIGHT, ANOTHER, SO LET ME
STOP YOU THERE.
I FEEL I GET ALONG WITH
EVERYBODY.
IN THIS TRIBE?
IN THIS TRIBE.
WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU GET ALONG
WITH EVERYBODY?
BECAUSE I DO.
LACK OF SELF-AWARENESS--
 YOU DONT HAVE TO DEFINE THAT
FOR ME.
IS THAT ALL?
HOLD OLISTEN, LET ME JUST SAY
THIS, NOW, I AM BLACK.
YOU ARE BLACK.
I HAVE A KINSHIP TO YOU, TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE... LOOK OUT FOR
EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
UH-HUH.
AND THE LACK OF
SELF-AWARENESS IS YOU SOMETIMES
THINK THAT AN IDEA IS ACTION.
THATS NOT TRUE.
OKAY.
SHE WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANYBODY
ELSE, AND SHES BEEN MARRIED 24
YEARS.
SO THAT MEANS SOMEBODY LOVES HER
AS SHE IS.
THAT MEANS SHES NOT MAKE
ANYTHING CHANGES.
I LITERALLY DO NOT KNOW
WHATS WORSE?
THE STORM OR NATALIE.
LITERALLY, HAND IN HAND.
IF WE LOSE AT THE NEXT
CHALLENGE, IM GOING INTO TURB
OR, OVERDRIVE, IN GETTING
NATALIE OUT.

DAVID TRIBE, TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE, OUR
TRIBE APPEARS TO GET ALONG WELL.
BUT SUDDENLY WE HAVE TO PICK THE
SCALP OFF OF ALL OF THE BOILING
BLOOD BENEATH THE SURFACE.
THE QUESTION IS HOW CRAZY IS IT
GOING TO BE?
IT WAS HOT.
THE SUN WAS BEATING DOWN.
THAT WAS BRUTAL, EVEN BY
"SURVIVOR" STANDARDS.
THAT CHALLENGE.
ITS LIKE THEYRE INVINCIBLE.
THEY ARE TOUGH.
THEYRE SO BIG.
SOMETIMES IT FEELS, LIKE, A
LITTLE BIT UNFAIR, TOO.
I DONT AGREE WITH ANY OF
THAT.
IN MY SPORT, TECHNIQUE BEATS
EVERYTHING.
SO I DONT BELIEVE IN THE SIZE
THING.
AND I DONT THINK YALL SHOULD
GO FORTH WITH THAT MINDSET GOING
INTO EACH CHALLENGE THINKING YOU
HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST YOU,
WHICH YOU DONT.
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO EVERY
PROBLEM, AND YOU GUYS KNOW THAT
IN YOUR LIFE.
SO DONT LET TWO LOSSES CHANGE
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.
IT JUST SUCKS.
BI IS COMPLETELY RIGHT, BUT
IN REALITY, WE NEED TO WIN
CHALLENGES.
SO I THINK FOR THIS FIRST VOTE
THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE, I FEEL
VERY COMFORTABLE IN SAYING THAT
LYRSA IS GOING TO GO HOME.
HELLO.
HEY.
HEY.
SO WHO ARE YOU GUYS VOTING
FOR?
LYRSA.
SO WHO CELS GOING FOR LYRSA?
I JUST WANT TO COUNT.
I DONT THINK ANYBODY IS UPON
WANTING TO TALK RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS COMFORTABLE
WITH VOTING FOR HER.
AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE PLAN IS
TO GO FOR LYRSA.
BUT BI AND JESS KIND OF BLEW ME
OFF.
AND I FELT LIKE THEY WERE SAYING
GENERAL CLICHES, LIKE, CAN WE
TALK ABOUT THE VOTE?
AND THAT GIVES ME WEIRD VIBES.
SIMPLE AND EASY.
IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
STRENGTH, IT DOES MAKE ME UNEASY
BECAUSE IM NOT THAT MUCH BETTER
THAN LYRSA IN THE CHALLENGES.
I WANTED TONIGHT TO BE AN EASY
VOTE.
BUT I DONT FEEL AS COMFORTABLE
AS I DID A FEW DAYS AGO, AND
THATS REALLY SCARY.
THEYRE VOTING ME, RIGHT?
YEAH, CARL IS LIKE, "WE NEED
TO KEEP IT STRONG."
AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH."
WHO DO YOU THINK?
I WONDER WHY ME?
I DONT KNOW BIP OF BUT
THATS WHAT THEY SAID.
IM VERY PISSED OFF THAT HE
THINKS IM THE WEAKEST PERSON
HERE WHEN IM NOT.
ITS IRRITATING.
I DONT WANT TO LEAVE THIS
GAME.
I DONT THINK IM THE WEAKEST
LINK.
YOURE NOT THE WEAKEST LINK.
IM FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I
KNOW THAT MY NAME HAS BEEN
THROWN AROUND.
SCREW CARL.
HES GOING HOME, OKAY.
OR WE CAN WRITE JESSICAS NAME
DOWN.
IM NOT STUPID.
I KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.
JESS IS THE ONE THATS
CONNECTING EVERYTHING UP.
SHES BUDDY-BUDDY WITH BI AND
BUDDY-BUD WECARL.
SO SHES, LIKE THE THING THATS
HOLDING THEM TOGETHER.
AND WE NEED TO CUT HER OUT.
I LIKE YOU A LOT.
YEAH.
BUT I WANT TO DO WHATS BEST
FOR-- FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE.
SO ITS ME, I KNOW WHAT
YOURE SAYING.
NO, ITS NOT YOU.
THEN WHO ARE YOU SAYING?
I HAVENT TRUSTED JESSICA
SINCE DAY ONE.
HERE COMES LYRSA.
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT
TO BE A PART OF.
AGAINST JESS?
YES.
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO
BE A PART OF?
GET JESS OUT.
WE COULD GET JESS AND ITS LIKE
KNOCKING THOSE TWO PILLARS OUT.
YOU DONT HAVE TO CONVINCE
ME.
I DONT WANT IT TO BE ME.
WHOSE NAME WERE THEY TALKING
ABOUT UP THERE.
WE JUST CHANGED THINGS BIG
TIME.
WHAT HAPPENED WHAPPED?
IF WE GET RID OF JESS
TONIGHT, THERES NO CARL AND
JESS.
REALLY.
AND THERES NO JESS AND BI,
SO IT WOULD BE, LIKE, A DOUBLE
WIN.
THE CHICKEN HAS FLOWN THE
COOP.
THE WORD IS OUT.
THE TARGET IS JESS.
AND I AM SURPRISED HOW FAST
THINGS CHANGED, BUT IM
ENCOURAGED THAT THINGS MOVED SO
FAST, THEY FEEL A HYPERFRENETIC
PERSON LIKE ME IS THE IDEAL
PERSON TO HANDLE IT ALL.
CHRISTIAN, AM I STUPID?
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO TRUST YOUR
INSTINCTS IN THIS GAME.
I KNOW THAT.
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?
PLAY WITH YOU ON THE SAND?
NO, DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS
GAME WITH ME?
WHEN HAVE I EVER INDICATED
OTHERWISE?
I KNOW, I WANT TO PLAY WITH
YOU, TOO.
OF COURSE,.
THATS WHY IM ASKING ARE YOU
COMFORTABLE PROTECTING ME?
OF COURSE, IM--
 MORE THAN JESS.
DO YOU BOND WITH JESS?
NO, I DONT BOND WITH JESS AT
ALL.
DO YOU HAVE NICK FOR SURE?
I THINK SO.
GABBY IS BASICALLY BEGGING ME TO
MAKE THE VOTE GO THE WAY SHE
WANTS IT TO.
AND IM SAYING, "IM WITH YOU
ALL THE WAY, BUT I HAVE TO KEEP
IN MIND THAT FROM A CHALLENGE
PERSPECTIVE, LYRSA IS THE MOST
LOGICAL VOTE.
WHATS GOING ODUDE?
ALL HELL JUST BROKE LOOSE.
HOW.
LYRSA, ELISABETH, AND GABBY
KNOW IM TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
THE PLAN TO ELIMINATE JESS.
I SAY WE JUST GET LYRSA OUT
AND STAY STRONG.
SO AT THIS POINT, NICK AND I ARE
WEIGHING OUT SHOULD WE GET RID
OF THE CONSENSUS TARGET, VERSUS
MAKING A BIGGER MOVE AT THIS
VERY FIRST VOTE, WHICH IS AN
INHERENTLY RISKIER PROPOSITION.
EITHER WAY.
MASON-DIXON.
THE MASON-DIXON ALLIANCE IS IN A
POWER POSITION.
THIS IS A REALLY BIG DECISION.
ITS OUR FIRST TRIBAL, AND I CAN
MAKE SURE THE VOTE GOES THE WAY
THAT I PREFER IT TO GO.
THE POSITION IM IN NOW, BEING
THE ONE PULLING THE TRIGGER IS
EXACTLY WHEREIMENT TO BE.

Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB ONE, APPROACH
THE FLAME, DIP IT IN, AND GET
FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, FIRST TRIBAL, BUT ITS DAY
SIX, SO LETS JUST START AT THE
BEGINNING.
LYRSA, TELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST
FEW DAYS.
YOU DONT KNOW ANY OF THESE
PEOPLE, YET, IMMEDIATELY, ARE
YOU THROWN INTO A TOUGH STORM
AND A LOT OF OBSTACLES YOU HAD
TO OVERCOME.
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO RAIN
AT SOME POINT BEING FROM THE
CARIBBEAN, BUT I DIDNT KNOW IT
WAS GOING TO BE SO QUICK.
IT WAS BRUTAL.
JEFF, IT WAS SO RELENTLESS
THAT I AT THE END JUST GAVE UP
AND JUST LAID THERE AND PRAYED
THAT MY MENTAL STRENGTH WOULD
KEEP STRONG.
IT GOT PRETTY TIGHT, JEFF.
YEAH.
YEAH.
Jeff: SO, ELISABETH, FIRST
YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE THE
ELEMENTS, AND IN THE MIDST OF
DOING THAT, THIS TRIBE OF
STRANGERS SLOWLY STARTS TO
BECOME A FAMILY.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
THE CRISE HAS LITERALLY BROUGHT
PEOPLE TOGETHER.
SO SEEING THAT HUMANS STILL ARE
GOOD WHEN YOURE SURROUNDED BY
SO MUCH TERRIBLE NEWS ABOUT
THINGS ITS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT?
ITS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
Jeff: SO YOURE FORCED TO
WORK TOGETHER.
A FAMILY STARTS TO FORM.
AND THEN THE GREAT TWIST IN
"SURVIVOR" IS, "OH, YOU HAVE TO
VOTE EACH OTHER OUT."
LYRSA, HOW QUICKLY DID THAT PART
OF THE GAME HIT FULL SPEED?
YOU COULD CUT THE TENSION
WITH A KNIFE, AS YOU MIGHT HAVE
SAID.
AND YOU MIGHT THINK IM NOT
LOOKING AT WHATS HAPPENING.
BUT I KNOW WHATS HAPPENING.
I STUDY ANTHROPOLOGY.
I KNOW HOW TO STUDY PEOPLE.
SO I KNOW IM ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD MY
NAME BEING BROUGHT UP BEFORE.
APPARENTLY, IM THE WEAKEST
LINK, AND I DONT KNOW WHY.
IM JUST KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT.
I THINK THE WAYS OF THE GAME
ISNT WAIT UNTIL THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL TO START PLAYING.
AND IF THATS THE WAY YOURE
PLAYING THE GAME, THEN YOU NEED
TO RECHECK YOURSELF BECAUSE THIS
IS A GAME FOR A MILLION DOLLARS,
AND YOU BETTER PLAY LIKE IT,
BECAUSE IF NOT, YOUR NAMES
GOING TO BE THE ONE THATS UP
THERE, AND YOURE GOING TO BE
REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
Jeff: GABBY, PRETTY WELL
SAID.
THAT REALLY IS THE GAME.
IT STARTS DAY ONE.
YEAH, I THINK WHAT JESSICA
SAID, I UNDERSTAND.
BUT I ALSO THINK EVERYONE ON
THIS TRIBE IS SMART.
THERES A REASON WERE HERE, SO
I THINK EVERYONES BEEN PLAYING.
Jeff: BI, WHERE DO YOU FALL
IN THIS?
FIRST TIME WERE VOTING, ARE YOU
CONSTANTLY RE-EVALUATING THE
CRITERIA IN THIS MOMENT?
I HAVE A SIMPLE VOTE FOR ME.
MINE IS ON PERFORMANCE AT CAMP
AND IN THE CHALLENGES.
IT THE PROBABLY GET MORE
COMPLICATED AS THE GAME GOES,
BUT FOR ME RIGHT NOW, ITS QUITE
SIMPLE.
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, BI JUST
SAID IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY, "I
KNOW WHAT IM DOING," WHICH IS A
BOLD STATEMENT TO SAY TO OTHERS,
WHICH IS, "IM PLAYING MY GAME."
AND YET THIS ALL STILL
FUNCTIONS AS AN INTERESTING GAME
THAT WE COULD ALL HAVE ALL THESE
INDIVIDUAL MOTIVATIONS AND, YET,
RARELY ARE THERE, LIKE, NINE
DIFFERENT TARGETS.
SO WE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO
ORGANIZE OUR VOTES TOGETHER.
UH-HUH.
Jeff: ALL OF YOU ARE
NODDING YES, THE VOTES ARE
ORGANIZED.
NICK, ITS IMPOSSIBLE.
SOMEBODY DOESNT KNOW WHATS
HAPPENING, AT LEAST ONE PERSON.
THE WAY I SEE IT, THIS GAME
IS BUILT ON DECEIT.
SO THAT MAKES TRUST RARE, AND IT
PUTS TRUST AS A PREMIUM.
Jeff: YOU ALSO HAVE TO
WEIGH THAT AGAINST WHAT IS GOOD
FOR THE TRIBE?
BECAUSE THE MORE YOU COME BACK
HERE, THE MORE LIKELY ITS YOU
GOING HOME.
YEAH, THERES ABSOLUTELY A
BALANCE.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY CAN TRUST
MOTHER TERESA.
I DONT THINK SHE COULD RUN THAT
CHALLENGE TODAY.
SO TRUST ISNT ENOUGH.
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, WERE GOING UP AGAINST
THE GOLIATH TRIBE.
LIKE THEIR WOMEN ARE SIX-FOOT
TALL, IM PRETTY SURE.
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, WHERE DO
YOU FALL ON THIS?
HOW DO YOU BALANCE WHATS GOOD
FOR ME VERSUS WHATS GOOD FOR
THE TRIBE?
I MEAN, IF WE THINK WERE
GOING TO MERGE TOMORROW, THE
STRATEGY IS TO NOT CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT THE TRIBE, BUT BECAUSE
WERE SO EARLY, THIS IS THE
FIRST TRIBAL, SO WE HAVE VERY
LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT THERE
COULD BE ANYTHING SWAPPING US
ANY TIME SOON.
SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE NEEDS
OF THE TRIBE PRETTY HEAVILY.
Jeff: SO THEN WHAT IS THE
NERVE LEVEL RIGHT NOW FROM 0 TO
10?
10.
11.
YEAH.
Jeff: JESSICA, WHATS IT
BASED ON?
I THINK ITS PARTIALLY
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WERE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND THIS IS A
SCARY THING.
BUT, ALSO, KIND OF EXHILARATING
AT THE SAME TIME.
THERE OFTEN ISNT
EXHILARATION WITHOUT RISK.
THATS HOW I SEE IT, TYPICALLY.
Jeff: HOW SO?
A LOT OF TIMES THE SENSE THAT
YOURE SORT OF TRANSCENDENTLY IN
THE MOMENT.
ITS NOT AS SOMETHING AS
TERRIFYING AS TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IT COULD BE, LIKE, A ROLLER
COASTER.
IF YOU IN YOUR DEEPEST PART OF
YOUR MIND KNEW THAT THAT ROLLER
COASTER WAS SAFE, WOULD YOU
REALLY BE AS EXCITED?
OR IS IT BECAUSE YOURE
CONVINCED IN THIS MOMENT YOURE
FALLING AND YOURE GOING TO DIE
THAT MAKES IT VERY EXCITING?
AMAZING.
HES SO GOOD.
( LAUGHTER ).
Jeff: SEEMS LOOK A PERFECT
TIME TO GET TO THE VOTE.
CARL, YOURE UP.
♪ ♪
 WE GOTTA KEEP THIS TRIBE
STRONG.
WEVE GOT TO WIN A CHALLENGE.
I REALLY WANTED TO WORK WITH
YOU.
BUT I GIST COULDNT FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
I HOPE THIS WORKS.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND UP TO THE PLAY IT, NO
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
ILL READ THE VOTES.

WOW!
WOW!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
Jeff: JESSICA, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
BYE, GUYS.
Jeff: WELL, EACH ONE OF YOU
IS HERE BECAUSE YOUVE OVERCOME
ADVERSITY IN YOUR LIFE.
THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU DO IT AS
A TRIBE?
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR
SCENES FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":
WHEN YOU FEEL ALL ALONE...
I DIDNT EXPECT THIS GAME TO
BE THIS HARD.
Jeff: YOU NEED TO FIND A
KINDRED SPIRIT.
THE NERD HAVE IT, LIKE, YEAR
WEIR IN.
Jeff: OR YOULL GO CRAZY.
I KNOW THAT DAN HAS THE IDOL.
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS.
YOU THROWING MY NAME OUT
THERE.
TO BE THE FIRST ONE VOTED
OUT, ITS SAD, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME, ITS KIND OF A COMPLIMENT
TO ME THAT THEY VIEWED ME AS
THAT BIG OF A THREAT.
I CAME OUT OF THE GATE, AND I
WANTED TO PLAY HARD.
AND I GUESS I TRUSTED SOME
PEOPLE THAT I SHOULDNT HAVE
TRUSTED.
AND IT BIT ME IN THE BUTT.
IN THE END, I GUESS I WAS THE
FIRST #BLINDSIDE OF THE SEASON.
