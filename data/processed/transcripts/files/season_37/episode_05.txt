"SURVIVOR": EVERYBODY DROP YOUR
BUFFS.
OH, MY GOD.
I FREAKING KNEW TJEFF!
YEAH!
Jeff: THE GOLIATHS HAD THE
ADVANTAGE OF THREE NEW TRIBES.
THE DAVIDS ARE COLLECTIVELY
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
Jeff: WHILE CARL WAS THE
ODD MAN OUT.
YOURE GOING TO EXILE ISLAND.
WOW.
Jeff: AT EXILE ISLAND, CARL
FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.








THE VUKU TRIBE WAS FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THE GOLIATHS WERE IN CHARGE.
BUT ALEC CONSIDERED BETRAYING
ONE OF HIS OWN.
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, ALEC MADE A
BIG MOVE.
I DONT LIKE THAT AT ALL.
Jeff: ...WHEN HE VOTED OUT
NATALIA.
NATALIA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
AND CARL JOWND THE VUKU TRIBE.
15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
CARL IM KARA.
NICE TO PETE YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.








NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW WAS EXILE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
REALLY?
YEAH, IT WAS HORRIBLE.
LEAVING THE TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
FEEL NAKED.
I FEEL EXPOSED.
I FEEL LIKE THIS WAS NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
ALEC BLINDSIDED ME.
HE BACKSTABBED NATALIA, AND HE
FULL ON BLEW IT.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE,
LIKE, DONT DO IT NOW.
LIKE I SAID, JUST DO IT, JUST
DO IT.
YEAH, WHICH IS AWESOME.
SO I DID IT.
YOU HAVE AWESOME TRUST WITH
THEM.
IM WORRIED ABOUT WHERE DOES IT
LEAVE ME?
RIGHT, YOU AND I ARE STILL
TOGETHER?
DO YOU PROMISE.
100%.
WHATS DONE IS DONE, AND I TRUST
MY GUT.
OKAY, LETS MOVE FORWARD,
KEEP WINNING--
YOU GOT IT.
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW AM I
GOING TO GET IN THE GOOD GRACE
OF DAVIDS, BECAUSE ALEC IS THE
KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMORED THAT
SAVED ALL THREE OF THEM AND I
WAS THE ONE WHO WAS BLINDSIDED
UPON SO I HAVE SOME SCRAMBLING
TO DO.

WE HAVE TO COVER THE FIRE.
AH!
THE ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN CRAZY.

EVERYONE IS FREEZING.
AND NOW THERE IS A RIVER OF
WATER THAT IS GOING THROUGH THE

ITS COMPLETELY FLOODED.
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME,
WEVE SAT THROUGH RAIN AND CRAZY

I SUPPOSED TO TRUST HIM MOVING
FORWARD?
EXACTLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE
DIDNT KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP WITH

NEED TO LOOK AT WHO CAN I TRUST?
WHO DO I WANT AT THE MERGE?
WERE GOOD?
OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
CAN I GET THIS JACKET.
IM THE ONLY MEMBER WHO IS
GOING TO USE THIS JACKET
TONIGHTS VOTE IS SO
CRITICAL, GIVEN THAT NATALIA IS
OUT OF THE GAME NOW, BY TAKING
OUT NATALIE, WE ARE TAKING OUT
ANOTHER GOLIATH, WHICH PUTS US
EVEN MATCH, 7-7, WITH DAVID.
SO MY MINDS RACING.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A BIG
DECISION, AND THERES NO WIGGLE
ROOM.
THERES NO ROOM FOR ERROR.

JEFF ALRIGHT LETS GET INTO IT
ANGELINA, 15 DAYS IN, YOU HAVE
THREE GOLIATHS AND TWO DAVIDS.
HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT DOES THAT
HAVE ON HOW THIS GAME IS GOING
TO PLAY OUT?
SO, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
THAT IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR
BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,
NOT ONLY AT JABENI, BUT ACROSS
THE BOARD.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT
WE CAN MAINTAIN THOSE NUMBERS.
AND SO, AT THIS POINT, WE DO
WANT TO STAY GOLIATH STRONG.
BUT THEY KEEP SAYING,
"GOLIATH STRONG.
NATALIA-- YOU GUYS DONT KNOW
WHATS GOING ON, ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
ACTUALLY, WE DID COMMIT TO
GOING GOLIATH STRONG.
THERE IS STILL A GOLIATH TRIBE.
THAT WAS THE PLAN WHEN WE
PARTED, AND IM GOING TO STAND
IN BELIEF TO WHAT IVE COMMITTED
TO SO--
BUT YOU WERENT THE FIRST
OPTION AT THAT FIRST TRIBAL.
IM ALWAYS IN TROUBLE HERE,
JEFF.
NO, ITS NOT THAT YOUR--
 ALL OF THESE TRIBAL COUNCILS,
IM THE PERSON THAT SEEMS TO BE
STRUGGLING HERE.
Jeff: LETS TALK ABOUT
THAT.
IS THAT NEW FOR YOU?
IT CERTAINLY IS.
I AM NEVER THE CENTER OF DRAMA.
I AM NEVER THE CENTER OF DRAMA.
Jeff: IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
LIFE BACK HOME, ARE YOU IN
CHARGE?
YES, BUT I AM MORE LAID BACK
THAN WHAT YOUD NORMALLY GET.
BEING ON THE TRIBE AND BEING
MORE COLLABORATIVE ITS OTHER
DAY THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE EGGS.
IM SAYING LETS BOIL ALL THE
EGGS AND GET IT OVER WITH.
BUT WE DONT HAVE THE CORRECT
TEMPERATURE TO HOLD THE EGGS.
IN FOUR HOURS, THOSE EGGS ARE
GOING TO START CREATING
BACTERIA, AND I LEARNED THAT AT
SCHOOL.
I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THIS.
WHAT IM SAYING IS IT DOESNT
TAKE FIVE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON
BOILING EGGS.
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE, TELL US WHAT
TO DO, AND WELL DO IT.
I HAVE TO JUMP IN, FOR
NATALIE, HE REALLY PRIORITIZES
EFFICIENCY BUT SOMETIMES THE
FASTEST WAY TO GET THERE ISNT
TO GET EVERYONE ON THE TRAIN TO
GET TO THAT PLACE.
IT DOES FEEL NATALIE HAS
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT A LOT OF
THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT CAMP.
REALLY?
YEAH, HOW THINGS ARE DONE,
HOW QUICKLY, THEYRE DONE, WHERE
THEY SHOULD GO.
YOU KNOW, THERES DISAPPROVAL
LOOMING IN THE AIR IF THINGS
ARENT DONE THE WAY YOU WANT
THEM TO BE DONE.
Jeff: SO, MIKE, SO FAR,
YOUVE HAD AN ISSUE WITH
NATALIE.
ANGELINA HAS HAD AN ISSUE WITH
NATALIE, AND YET IT SOUNDS
LIKE--
 YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ME?
WE HAVENT HAD AN ISSUE.
WE HAVE DIFFERENCES.
WE TALK IT THROUGH AND MOVE ON.
Jeff: MY BAD.
NO ISSUE WITH THE GLGHTZ.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING ALONG
REALLY WELL.
NICK, WHERE DO YOU FALL IN THIS?
TODAY, I TALK TO NATALIE.
SHE DONT CARE WHAT I HAVE TO
SAY.
ALL SHES WORRIED ABOUT IS
JACKETS.
HERES THE FACT, JEFF.
IM IN SALES.
AND I SAW IT AS A NEGOTIATING,
NOT A BULLYING.
IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME
AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE
TO A MAIN PLAYER IN THE GAME,
WELL, I WAS LEVERAGING.
Jeff: YOURE SAYING, "IF
YOU GIVE ME YOUR JACKET, I MAY
THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR LYRSA?"
 INDIRECTLY.
Jeff: INDIRECTLY.
WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE?
IMPLYING THAT, YES?
I DIDNT SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT.
BUT THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE
CONVERSATION, YES.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
ITS NOT UNBELIEVABLE.
IM IN SALES.
LIKE I SAID.
I SAID IT SHOULD BE BELIEVABLE.
IM IN SALES.
WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT A
PERSON.
WERE TALKING ABOUT A PERSON
WEARING A JACKET THEY NEEDED.
FOR ME, THATS VERY, VERY
MEAN, YOU KNOW.
ITS IMPERSONAL.
Jeff: MIKE--
 ACTUALLY --
SORRY, I INTERRUPTED YOU
AGAIN YOU KEEP GOING.
ANGELINA, YOU WANT TO HELP ME
OUT WITH THE JACKET SITUATION?
SO NATALIE WAS TRYING TO HELP
ME OUT.
JUST FULL TRANSPARENCY.
BUT I WASNT EYE WOULD NEVER-- I
DID NOT STEAL ANYONES STUFF.
I DO THINK THAT NATALIE WAS
DOING THAT OUT OF LOVE FOR ME.
SHE KNOWS THAT IVE BEEN
FREEZING AT NIGHT, AND SO I DO
THINK IT CAME FROM A REALLY
RIGHT PLACE.
AND SO I DO JUST WANT TO DEFEND
HER ON THAT FRONT.
I THINK THAT IT CAME FROM LOVE.
Jeff: MIKE, ANGELINA HAS
BEEN A PEACEKEEPER THE ENTIRE
TRIBAL.
ANY TIME THERES AN ARGUMENT
WITH THE GOLIATHS, SHES THE ONE
WHO SAID, "EVEN THOUGH WE SOUND
LIKE WERE MAD AT YOU IM WITH
YOU."
YOU HAVE TO WALK A FINE LINE.
FOR ME, I DO THINK ITS STILL A
NUMBERS GAME.
KNOWING YOU HAD A GROUP THAT
MADE A COMMITMENT THAT MAYBE
WILL GIVE YOU SOME SAFETY IS
WORTH SOMETHING.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE LOOKING
TOWARD THE NEXT STAGE OF THIS
GAME.
AND IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU
VIBE WITH, PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK
YOU CAN WORK WITH, PEOPLE THAT
YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST.
ITS PART OF THE FACTORS THAT
YOURE WEIGHING AS AWE MAKE
DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD.
AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE
JACKETS.
IM SORRY.
I HAD TO GO THERE.
Jeff: NATALIE, I THINK I
JUST FIGURED YOU OUT.
YOU NEED THE LAST WORD.
YUP.
Jeff: IS THAT FAIR?
NO.
NOT ALWAYS.
Jeff: JACKETS AND EGGS.
IT HAS BEEN A LIVELY TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
LYRSA, YOURE UP.
TAKE YOUR MEMBERS ONLY JACKET
BACK TO BOSTON.
I LIKE YOUR PURPLE HAIR.
YOU CAN MAKE A PREACHER CUSS.
YOU CAN MAKE A PREACHER CUSS.
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY.
ILL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, NATALIE.
LYRSA.
NATALIE.
TWO VOTES NATALIE.
LYRSA.
WERE TIED, TWO VOTES LYRSA, TWO
VOTES NATALIE, ONE VOTE LEFT.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH," NATALIE.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
OKAY.
OH, MY GOD.
I JUSTMENTED TO GIVE YOU A
HUG.
IM SORRY.
NATALIE, IS THERE ANY WAY I
COULD HAVE YOUR JACKET?
NATALIE.
Jeff: NATALIE, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
NATALIE?
Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
THANK YOU.
IS IT WORTH $1 MILLION?
GUESS NOT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
Jeff: WELL, BASED ON
TONIGHTS VOTE, IT WOULD APPEAR
YOU CHOSE TRIBAL HARMONY OVER
TRIBAL LINES.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":
WHEN THE BATTLE LINES BLUR...
AS FAR AS THE GAMES GO, SHE
WOULD CUT YOU.
I JUST DONT TRUST ANGELINA.
Jeff: FRIENDS BECOME
ENEMIES.
I DONT LIKE STUPID PEOPLE.
Jeff: AND ENEMIES BECOME
FRIENDS.
ITS NOT DO I BLINDSIDE DAN.
ITS WHEN.
I DONT FEEL LIKE I DESERVED
ALL OF THE BAD RAP THEY GOT.
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE
SAID ARE TRUE.
HOWEVER, I WAS LOVING THE GAME,
AND MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I
DIDNT STAY IN THE GAME LONGER.
I DIDNT GIVE ANGELINA MY JACKET
BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW IF SHE WAS
A PART OF THE REASON WHY IM
OUT.
SO WHY SHOULD I?
I DONT HAVE TO.
AND I CHOSE NOT TO.
SO IM WEARING IT.
