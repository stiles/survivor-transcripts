        Previously on "Survivor":
Sash and Brenda were king
and queen of the beach.
We're the two most powerful
people in this game.
And they thought everyone
else was a peasant.
People need to remember
where their place is.
Their reliance was strengthened
by two hidden immunity idols.
Brenda's best friend Naonka had
one, and sash had the other.
But some of the peasants
were getting restless.
There is a temptation to want to
suddenly take control and make a move.
Yeah, Marty!
So at the reward feast,
Marty succumbed to








temptation and tried to
launch an all-guys rebellion.
Take this thing to the end, men.
We earned it!
Fabio and benry immediately
jumped on board.
Marty is a smart guy.
He knows what he's doing.
Sash food Marty by pretending
to join us up with him.
I tried to boost his ego so he'll
continue to come back to me.
Marty didn't approach chase because he
was too close with Brenda and Jane.
I wanted to show the girls they
can trust me and hopefully
that will get me further in the
game gl at tribal council,
Brenda and sash squashed Marty's plan.
Marty, the tribe has spoken.
And Marty along with him.








Now Brenda and sash have so much
power that everyone is look over
their shoulder.
10 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
Tribal council really showed
where the allegiance really is.
Benry, fabio, and Dan now see that
sash and I aren't on their side.
And we took out their
little leader Marty.
Now it's only a matter
of time before they go.
I'm going to get a good
night's sleep tonight.
Oh, yeah.
I think sash and I being in control ask
look like a king and queen situation.
But sash is more of a queen and I'm more of a king, the way I
look at it.
Jane and I both had the same
feeling that Brenda is basically
calling all the shots.
So we are totally going to make a
power move before next tribal.
I mean, seriously, what
do I have to lose?
Something has to change,
and it has to change soon.
This rain is bad, man.
The elements out here
can really get you.
This morning, we woke up, and it
looked like it was going to rain.
We all know that it's important
that the fire at least stays going.
So we moved, like, all of the
chests around the fire to
protect it from the rain.
That's important.
I got up three times in the
middle of the night and I was
going to wake you up but then didn't.
I've come a long way in this game.
Day five I was ready to leave, and here
I am, sitting here with 14 days left.
I'm, like, my gosh.
I could really keep going.
So right now, Jane and I, we're trying
to rally a vote against Brenda or sash.
What happened last night?
Sash and Brenda told you guys
they were voting for Jane.
Right.
And they switched, and
they voted for Marty.
They are in total control.
Sash just backstabbed him last night.
Terribly!
Terribly.
So how can you trust Brenda and sash
when what they did at tribal last night.
I can't.
Everybody is listening
to Brenda, including me.
Kelly purple crawls up Brenda's ***.
She does exactly what she wants to do.
Brenda is also another threat because
she's really good at challenges.
And she's going to take
you guys out one by one.
Holly absolutely gave me a little
bit of a wake-up call this morning.
She's got a great plan, actually.
And I'm all for it, you know,
getting rid of sash and Brenda
is number one on my list right now.
Brenda's the queen bee, and
knows this game in and out.
She must have been
studying this forever.
Brenda and playing this game so
well to where she's over-thinking.
She's Marty Jr.
I don't like to associate
myself with villains.
Not in real life.
Not in this game.
She's become a villain.
She befriend you and then she
throws you to the wolves.
But I need your help
to get rid of Brenda.
Brenda, she's like my best
friend out here, but did I come
out here all this way from south central l.
A. To go back home with nothing?
No.
This is a game.
And Brenda is a threat.
So right now, while we have
everybody against her, now is
the time to get her out.
We need to see who wins individual
immunity, and then we need to decide.
But I think we're all in consensus
that Brenda has to go first.
She's the ring leader.
Things are getting a
little crazy here at camp.
There are two alliances now, and
I personally think it could be
in the best interest to
vote benry out first.
I still don't trust benry.
Benry is on his last rope.
He screwed up and he voted with Marty,
pluz he's a big physical threat.
As of right now, I don't think
Brenda and sash have lied to me.
So I'm stuck in the middle
of two alliances again.
Chase, you have to
believe me on this one.
She is totally running the show.
I think you're wrong.
Chase was a little
leery about the plan.
He was a little concerned about Ben.
So I'm keeping my eye on chase
just because chase, I feel I can
trust him, but at this point in the game,
he makes me just a little nervous.
Come on in, guys!
Guys ready to get to
today's reward challenge?
Yes.
For today's challenge, you will be
divided into two teams of five.
Using only four barrels, two
planks, and 10 feet of rope, you
must work together to make your
way across the beach to the
finished platform without
touching the ground.
If anybody from your team
touches the ground, the entire
team has to go back to the start.
First team to get all five members
to the finish platform wins reward.
Want to know what you're playing for?
Yes!
Reporter: The winning team
will travel to the seronegrow,
one of the most active
volcanos in the world.
You'll do a little volcano
boarding and enjoy pizza, soft
drinks, and chocolate brownies.
I know it's worth playing for.
We'll do a school yard
pick to get our teams.
We'll get started.
On the blue team, chase, purple
Kelly, Jane, Naonka, and fabio.
On the yellow team sash, holly,
Brenda, Dan and benry.
For reward.
Survivors ready?
Go!
You have four barrels, two planks
of wood, and 10 feet of rope.
What you do with it will determine
who wins this challenge.
Both teams off to a good start
trying to figure out a system,
what's going to be the key to
moving the entire team of five
across the beach when you
can't touch the ground.
Stay low, chase, stay low.
Stay low.
Keep it close!
Keep it close!
Roll that to safn.
Purple Kelly, can you
reach that barrel?
See if you can get
your feet behind you.
Where do you want me?
Blue team wants their last
barrel and they can't get it.
I don't think we need it.
I don't either.
Let's go with it.
Dan, battling two bad knees, going
to try to get up on this barrel.
Doesn't look like it's
comfortable but he's up there.
That's all that matters.
Blue team has a system and it
is working, only using three of
their four barrels.
Yellow team just winging it.
A little circ de soleil
going on with benry.
Chase has a very good stat
ghee for the blue team.
Blue team working together very calm.
Yellow team looks like they're in
pain, crunched over, confused.
It's rolling!
It's rolling.
Yellow team, everybody fell off,
everybody back to the start.
Dan is hurt.
Dan smashed his hand.
Huge setback for the yellow team.
The only thing the yellow team can hope
for is a mistake by the blue team.
Brenda trying to roll
on one of the barrels.
That work, for a minute.
Between my legs.
Yellow team has made very little
progress in this challenge.
If this were life or
death, you'd be dead.
Y'all stay focused.
Rain starting to come down now.
Fabio will be first to
cross for the blue team.
Don't jump!
Don't jump!
That rolls the barrel.
Benry still can't figure it out.
They win reward!
Pizza, brownies, and volcano surfing.
Benry makes the best move in the
challenge for the yellow team
with the ceremonial loser dismount.
Man, we weren't even close.
Blue team, congratulations.
Here's what's going to happen.
You're going to spend the afternoon
doing a little volcano boarding.
You will then enjoy hot pita, chocolate
brownies, and some soft drinks.
Sound like a fun afternoon?
Yes!
Yes!
I forgot to tell you how you're getting there, by
helicopter
I've never been on a helicopter!
I've never been in a
helicopter and I never thought
I'd even have a passport in this
lifetime let alone be in a helicopter.
I'm blown away, blown away.
Oh, look at this!
Check this out!
That's a volcano way over there.
Look at that.
No way!
Flying up to the vol cane
orb it was so awesome.
I don't think any of us really expected
it to be that piews b beautiful.
That is amazing.
We land on this humongous
black mountain, and it was
almost like you were
walking on the moon.
You could see steam rising up,
and you could just feel the heat
coming up between you and the ground.
How active do you think this thing is?
Active.
At the challenge, Jeff had
mentioned volcano surfing as
part of the reward, so we're
actually going to be cruising
down the side of this volcano, and
I've never even heard of that perfect.
Before.
That blew my mind, dude.
Wow, man!
Dude!
That was crazy!
Hey, I'm hanging with the kid now.
Just because I may be a little bit older
than them, I'm not afraid to do this.
Let's go, Jane!
Go, Jane!
Yeah!
That was fun as crap!
I loved it.
I've ridden one of those
electronic bulls, you know, and
that's what it was like,
riding a little bull.
It was an experience
I'll never forget.
What do you guys think's going
down at camp jai don't care.
Oh, my God, guys.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
Everything burned.
All of it?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys.
I'm going to cry.
Look at the machetes.
How did that happen?
Not only did we lose reward
challenge, but we just got back
to camp, and pretty much our
entire camp just burned down.
Oh, my God.
This is un-freaking-believable.
We're trying to keep this damn
fire going day in and day out.
We left and it was raining so we
created a little barricade with
our three chests, wooden chests,
one of which had all the rest of
our food in it.
You guys, did we really build
that fire up that big?
Yeah.
Look how hot it was.
Look how the glass melted.
Oh, my God.
We're lucky the whole
thing didn't burn down.
We lost all our machetes.
Only the blades are left.
We had our flour.
We had our mangos.
There were a couple of to natos left.
There was an eggplant left.
That was all burned down, and now we
have 10 people with a cup of rice a day.
I don't know how we're going to do it.
Look at the tarp.
It melted.
The tarp, we can... it's okay.
We'll just turn it around.
This is unbelievable.
Do you believe this?
It's not worth getting upset about.
It's just something that we
have... it's already done.
We have to clean it up.
Someone should probably wake me up and
tell me that this did not happen.
I mean, I guess all we can do is wrangle
what we have left and keep it going.
But this is a day from hell.
I'm going to have a piece of
everything on this table.
I can't believe it.
25 days, I haven't had
chocola chocolate.
Reward was awesome!
We pigd out.
And I mean, everybody put
stuff on their plate.
I wolfed down a brownie
right off the bat.
Then hit the banana bread and pizza.
And then I sucked down
about three glass of soda.
I could have cared less what
they're doing back at camp
because that was heaven.
Who do you all think
is running the show?
That is what's so unclear after
everything that happened yesterday.
I think we should try to get a
consensus how we're feeling
and how other people are feeling because
it's going to make tomorrow easier.
Come here.
Come here.
Why did nay take him aside.
Nay does that.
On the volcano.
You never talk.
I know, it's kind of funny.
That makes a lot of sense,
bet you didn't know that.
No, that's for real-for real.
That's for real-for real.
She's sneaky.
Naonka pulls me aside and says
we have to work together.
We can get Brenda out of here.
She's running the show.
And I'm thinking, this is great.
It just fell right into my hands
and I'm totally going to milk it
for all it's worth, you know.
And hopefully I can stay under the
radar and slither through things.
Like, I want Brenda gone tomorrow.
She wouldn't see this
blinded side coming at all.
We can't let her hear about it.
I haven't been saying anything.
What about chase?
What about chase?
Does he want her out.
He's so scatter brained.
If you guys are in,
I'm going to do it.
I'm in.
All right.
In order to win this game,
you must make power moves.
You can make a big move that can
shift the game in the whole
other direction, but if you make
a power move, you're making a
move that will push you forward,
and the more you keep making
these power moves, everything's
just going to fall in line.
0d holly's freaking out.
She's trying to change
the game up right now.
Okay.
When I got back from the reward,
I wanted to talk to Brenda.
I just decided to come out and
tell her, you know, the plan.
That the others have.
Well, here's what's going on.
There's this plan right
now to take you out.
Oh, my God.
It's holly that's orchestrating it.
Hole and Ben, I think.
For whatever reason, I trust Brenda.
That's all it am cans down to is
I trust her and I put my game
plan in her and, you know,
there is no reason or rhyme.
It's just the simple
fact that I trucht her.
, you know, I've gone with
my heart this entire game.
There's no reason for me to turn
at this point and backstab you.
That would just make
me look like an ass.
Cool.
Luckily, I have chase, who
trusts me 1,000%, and he came
and told me the whole plan.
It is a challenge right now.
But I still think that I don't have
to do anything crazy to beat them.
Like, I'm not even that impressed.
What do you think about Brenda?
She's shady right now.
And she has too much power right now.
But I don't think it's most important
to get Brenda out right now.
I think it's most
important to get benry.
Whoa, I don't know about benry.
I think it should be Brenda.
Do you trust holly?
For now.
I don't right now.
Hole and benry have put together
this plan to vote out Brenda next.
And I told Brenda that.
Chase has been running around
here like a chicken with his
head cut off, telling
people's game plans.
Lately, he's been so scatter brained
and so nervous that I have to flop.
I have to be smart.
I have to go with holly and Jane.
I have to go with the people who
want to get the strong people out.
It's the smart thing to do.
We cannot trust chase.
Really?
We can't.
And I know that's mind blowing
and it sound like I'm ***.
Do not trust them.
He's playing both in the middle.
He wants you out next.
Really?
What do we do.
We have to get Brenda out, we have to
get sash out and then get chase out.
So you're in on this.
Chase is crazy.
He's been playing with mis heart and
emotion this entire game since day two.
He is being played by Brenda.
Hopefully chase will grow a pair
and realize what's good for him.
Chase is totally against
getting Brenda or sash out.
You sure about that?
I am so... Jane, look at me.
I am dead serious.
You ceent trust chase right now.
And he's like wigging out.
I originally trusted chase,
but chase is sucking up to
Brenda like he wants to get
in her pants or something.
I have no idea what kind of
magic spell she's casting over
chase right now, but if that big
old country boy wants to go back
on his word, he's going to catch
hell when he gets back to
Carolina because Carolina
people don't like that.
You cannot trust chase.
I told you.
You cannot.
You just can't.
I knew it.
He's not going to vote for Brenda.
Doesn't he see that Brenda and sash
are in total charge of this game?
Yeah, he sees it but he's stupid.
What the is wrong with chase?
Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to
today's immunity challenge?
Yes.
Absolutely.
First things first,
Brenda, I'll take it back.
Thank you.
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you're
going to stand on a very small
platform over the water.
You'll lean back holding on to a rope.
Every five minute, you'll move
your hands further down the
rope, making it more difficult.
When you can't hold on any
longer, you'll fall in the
water, you're out of the challenge.
Last person left standing wins
immunity and is guaranteed a
1-in-9 shot at a million dollars.
All right, we'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.
All right, everybody move your
hands down to that first knot.
We're looking good.
This challenge is on.
For immunity.
And a single-digit shot
at a million dollars.
Just make sure you do not put
your hands above that topknot.
Aahh!
Purple Kelly struggling.
Sash is first in the water.
Sash is first out.
Followed right behind by purple Kelly.
And we are down to eight.
Brenda now struggling a little.
Holly in the water.
Holly's third out.
Dan struggling and a nice recovery.
Using those guns!
You worked hard for those guns!
Brenda is out.
Dan is out.
Fabio's had enough.
He releases.
We are down to four.
Keep digging.
You do not want to go home tonight.
You do not want to go to tribal council without immunity around
your neck.
Benry digging deep.
Naonka drops out.
We are down to three now.
Chase, Jane, and benry.
Look at that.
The oldest woman in this game
going up against two of the
youngest and most fit guys,
showing no signs of strain.
Win one for the old guys, Janie.
I'm trying, honey.
Come obuddy.
All right, we're going
to move down to the next knot.
Aarrgg!
Aarexwrks gh!
Here we go.
You have five seconds to get there.
Make your might have five,
four, three, two, one.
There we go.
You guys are doing great.
Dig deep.
Right now, think only about
holding on to this rope.
Don't think about anything else.
Keep holding on.
And when you're tired,
find more strength.
Find something else.
Go deeper.
Benry is out, and we are down to two.
Good job, Ben.
Good job, benry.
We are down to chase and
Jane, arguably the most f
guy out here going against the
oldest woman in this game.
A great match-up.
Oh, my God.
However you feel Jane,
but I'm staying on here.
Well, my fingers are
about ready to go.
I'm pretty secure.
I'm anything to let go.
Why are you going to let go?
My fingers are cramping.
Come ojane.
Jane, dig.
Don't you dare give
up on this challenge!
Both you guys.
You've done tougher than this.
Keep fighting.
Hang in there, Jane.
Shift your weight around.
Chase is out.
Jane wins individual immunity.
Good job, Jane!
Good job.
You earned a little help.
Oh, crazy.
I'm glad I lift 80-pound dogs.
Crazy.
How close were
you to falling off?
My pinkies were, like, crushed.
You hung in long enough to
out-last chase, immunity tonight.
You're still shaking.
You won't be shaking
tonight at tribal council.
Are you safe tonight.
As for the rest of you,
somebody going home.
Get your stuff, head back to camp.
I'll see you at tribal.
Good work.
Man!
I wanted to win so bad!
And to get beat by Jane!
Props to her.
She's got some serious superwoman
strength deem inside of her.
Good job, Jane.
Good job, Jane.
That was a lot harder than it looked.
A lot harder.
My forearms are killing me, man.
Winning immunity was great.
I feel on top of the world right now.
I knew if it was anything
physically that had to do with
my hands, I would do okay,
because when you're fighting a
dog trying to go their toenails
you've got to have a real good
grip so I'm really happy right now.
And I think, unless she ends up with an
idol and plays it, Brenda will go home.
I talked to Brenda earlier.
We're good.
Cool.
So who do we target first?
I mean, we should probably think about
taking one of them out next, right?
Yeah, I mean, benry, right?
I think benry's the biggest
threat around here.
He's sharing a lot with,
like, hole, and maybe Dan.
I say we stick with that.
I personally think we should
vote benry out first.
I've been trying to play this
game with people I trust, and
right now I don't trust benry.
I'm trying to protect Brenda, but we
may not have the numbers to do it.
Chase is working my last nerve, sash.
He's so paranoid right now.
He drives me crazy.
He drives me nuts.
Yesterday he pissed me off to the
highest point of piss-ivity.
What I'm hearing is that
benry may be going home.
You want to know what's going on?
We're trying to vote
Brenda out tonight.
Me and you could make
a huge power move.
It will be so easy to get people
to turn on her because they see
her as a threat.
If you would have asked me a
few days ago, I'd say that
Brenda held a lot of
cards in this game.
But now, tides have turned a
little bit, and this is the
first time in the game that I'm
starting to worry a little bit.
You're coming to me straight, right?
Yeah.
The majority's voting Brenda.
All right, here's the deal.
There's two different things going on.
Here comes holly again.
Dang it.
What do you think about
the whole thing?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I've sat back and not really...
I just think Brenda's been the ring leader.
She was the ring leader
over at your camp.
She's the ring leader here.
He's got everybody on her list and
that's how they're going to go.
So that's how I feel.
I've been playing this game
with my heart and not my head a
lot of the time, and it
absolutely kills me that I might
have to vote Brenda out.
I don't trust benry.
I don't trust hole all that much.
Dan, I don't really trust him.
Nay, I don't trust her anymore.
So if Brenda's gone, I'm playing the
game with people I don't really trust.
That's a... that's a scary thought.
What's your game plan?
A lot of people are saying you.
I don't know if there's
any numbers to save you.
The thing that changed was nay.
What do you mean?
Nay's not gonna vote for me.
Nay swears she's voting for you.
Naya nay's the one that screwed it up.
It sure as hell wasn't my idea.
It looks like there is operation
take out Brenda in place.
I'm pretty annoyed about it.
But I think all I can do is stay cool.
The last thing I want to
do is start scrambling.
It just shows that you're desperate.
So if I show confidence, my
friends have confidence in me.
It shows that, yeah, I kind
of want to stick with Brenda.
Tell her homissed the
five of us first?
Naonka?
Exactly.
But how.
She wants you out.
I trusted her 1,000%.
Me, too.
But then now what?
None of those people are
going to be loyal to you.
They saw they're alliance and
now they're breaking it.
You think they're going to save you?
He over there running his mouth.
He's dangerous.
Chase has to learn
to shut the hell up.
What are you thinking?
What are you going to do?
Maybe you blindside them
with your immunity idol.
You know what I mean.
If I get voted out tonight, there's
no way you can get the numbers back.
The idol is confidential
something to be used... is
definitely something to be used
not only to protect yourself but
someone in your alliance.
My goal would be never to
have to use it at all.
However, at tribal council, the
moment came up where I needed to
use it to save Brenda, I'm going to have
to consider very strongly doing that.
You don't think sash is going
to give Brenda the idol?
Hell, no.
I'm just furious that Naonka
would make such a dumb move.
I thought we had ray great alliance.
I really believed we
would go to the end.
But now I don't even want
to see Naonka's face.
I wanted to take out benry, but
hopefully sash is going to give
me his immunity idol, and
we blindside Naonka.
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Alina and Marty, voted out
at the last tribal council.
Sash, were you surprised at the
last vote when Marty was sent home?
Yeah, I think a lot of people
were surprised, but since the
last tribal council, there's
been a lot of reshuffling in the
tribe, and so I think I'm more
out of the loop now than I've
been since the game started.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Chase, do you believe
sash believes he's out of the
loop jai do, because he had a
strong alliance, and now that
strong alliance seems to be go gone.
Brenda, any regrets
over the last vote?
Yeah.
I at any time want to vote mar Marty.
All my peeps know it, but I had
to prove something to people who
were in my alliance that
they could trust me.
How hard is it for you
to trust people out here?
Not hard.
I've never had a problem
with that from the start.
Any I thought that there was a
really strong core alliance, the
strongest one in this whole game.
I know that for a fact.
And it looks like what's
happening now is there's a break
in the alliance because of
Naonka wanting to jump ship, and
this is the most surprising
thing because I was worried
about these guys right here.
Meanwhile, she's the
one that wants to go.
Naonka, that's ray pretty
straight-out accusation.
I don't think it was me,
to be honest with you.
I think... hold on.
You don't think it was you?
It was not me.
Everybody could put it on me but
I'll put it like this... chase
was running around yesterday
with his head cut off.
It's something that chase does.
He didn't want what to do.
He was paranoid.
So you're telling Brenda
right now, "it wasn't me."
It was not me.
, you know, you've got to follow
your intuition in this game.
Can I get in on this?
It was not me.
Digo to Brenda because I trusted her.
So this is no new news to anybody.
Purple Kelly, weigh in on this.
Give us 20 years of wisdom.
Well, let me tell you,
20 years of wisdom.
I think that... well, I think
that this is the first tribal
council I felt completely out of
the loop on what's going on to
be completely honest.
Have you been
learning stuff tonight?
Yes, completely!
Like, my whole it's wheels
are turning in my head.
My game plan is, I'm,
like... it's enlightening.
So, Brenda, you've heard a lot of
people talking, now where do you sit?
What do you think happened?
Why would sash break up the best
alliance here because he's so smart.
And why would chase let me
in on it the day before.
He didn't have to tell me.
So it makes sense that it was
Naonka wanting to jump ship.
That makes more sense to me.
What happens, sash, if
you break trust in this game?
What do you put at risk?
That you may get sent home.
I think the people here that
really know me know that I am
trustworthy, and that's the only
reason why I made it to the
merge, and hopefully that's why I'll
stick around for another tribal council.
So, Brenda, did you
scramble this afternoon?
I did little things
they think would help.
I knew that if I had a chance, I
thought it would be with chase
and with sash, and fitalked with
both of them, to make them see
like, what the hell?
Maybe they would switch.
The rest is, whatever.
But that was my plan.
So, Brenda, you would
argue that you were trying to
stay in this game, even now.
Just not scrambling, yeah.
What is it about
the word "scrambling?"
Are you too proud for that word?
I think so.
It's the truth.
I just feel like there are
better options and there's a
different way to do things?
So scrambling is beneath you?
It's just not my style.
If people see you scrambling, they
see you as if you've already lost.
"Look at her, she's scambling.
Look at that.
Isn't she funny.
Don't you feel bad for her?"
Who can I really change here?
It's the people I have been
talking to the whole time pii
look at you one on one
and you know I'm real.
Sash, you have to
be shake inure boots.
This is disastrous for
anybody who had an alliance.
It's like a bomb dropped in here.
I think since last tribal council
everyone's alliances have changed a bit.
And people have a much different
outlook in the game now than
they did just a couple of days
ago, and sometimes you have to
make changes accordingingly.
Well, it sounds like there
are a couple of different
philosophies about what it takes
to keep yourself in this game.
Let's see how it plays out.
Jane, you have individual immunity.
I know you're keeping it.
Yes.
All right, you
cannot vote for Jane.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.
Dan, you're up.
You should have scrambled.
You are my real, true enemy, and I
thought you were my frie friend.
I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden
immunity idol and you want to
play it, now would be
the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are
read, the decision is final.
Person voted out will be asked to leave
the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote.
Brenda.
Naonka.
Benry.
One vote Brenda, one vote
benry, one vote Naonka.
Brenda.
That's two votes Brenda.
Brenda.
There's three votes Brenda, one
vote benry, one vote Naonka.
That's four votes Brenda.
11th person voted out and the
third member of our jury, Brenda.
That's five.
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Brenda, the tribe has spoken.
Ouch.
Time for you to go.
Well, if there's one thing to be
learned it's this: If you want
to win this game and the million
dollars that goes with it,
you've got to fight for it.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
Next time on "Survivor": Naonka's
antics have the tribe inab uproar.
I was just shocked that Naonka
would do something so stupid.
Naonka obviously wasn't
thinking straight.
We've got to get herr out now.
If one of the guys had done
that, I would have told them to
just get the out of here
and don't come back.
I'm still in disbelief, really,
at how outplayed I was
by the person they trusted
the most, Naonka.
