         Jeff Probst:
THIS SEASON'S CASTAWAYS
HAVE ENDURED 27 DAYS ON
THE RUGGED SHORES OF NICARAGUA.
THEY HAVE BATTLED EXHAUSTION,
STARVATION, AND EACH OTHER...
 I'LL PUSH YOU SO HARD
THAT DAMN LEG WILL FLY OFF.
 Jeff: ...IN THEIR FIGHT
TO BECOME THE SOLE SURVIVOR.
IF YOU ARE 40 AND OLDER,
YOU'RE OVER HERE.
30 AND YOUNGER,
YOU'RE OVER HERE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN SURVIVOR HISTORY,








TRIBES WERE DIVIDED
STRICTLY BY AGE.
 THE YOUNG GUNS.
 I'M YOUNG AT HEART!
 Jeff:
PITTING YOUNG AGAINST OLD
IN AN EPIC STRUGGLE
FOR DOMINANCE.
ON THE LA FLOR TRIBE,
PLAYERS WEREN'T AFRAID
TO USE THEIR YOUTH
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.
 I HAVE ALWAYS USED FLIRTING
AND OF COURSE I'M GOING
TO USE THAT IF I HAVE TO.
 Jeff: AND A CORE ALLIANCE
OF FIVE WAS FORMED...
 I TRUST US FIVE,
AND THAT IS IT.
 Jeff: ...DRAWING CLEAR LINES
WITHIN THE TRIBE.
THE OLDER TRIBE HAD
WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE,
BUT NOT EVEN THE PRESENCE
OF SUPER BOWL-WINNING COACH
JIMMY JOHNSON...








 TEAM HUDDLE.
 ALL: ESPADA!
 Jeff:
...COULD KEEP SOME OF THE TRIBE
FROM GOING OVER THE EDGE.
 SHE STOLE MY SHOES.
SHE STOLE THEM.
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT A GUY.
 IT'S ENJOYABLE JUST TO WATCH
A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
IN THIS TRIBE.
 Jeff: MARTY FINALLY
TOOK CONTROL AT ESPADA.
 DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ME.
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING
THIS GAME FOR REAL.
 Jeff:
BUT THEY COULD ONLY WATCH
AS THE YOUNG TRIBE
WON EARLY AND OFTEN,
SLASHING
THE OLDER TRIBE'S NUMBERS
AND PUTTING THEM
IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY.
HAVING ONLY BEEN
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL ONCE,
THE YOUNGER TRIBE
SEEMED INVINCIBLE.
DROP YOUR BUFFS.
BUT A SURPRISE SWITCH
CHANGED THE GAME DRAMATICALLY.
AT THE NEW ESPADA,
OLDER MEMBERS HOLLY AND DAN
JOINED FORCES
WITH THEIR NEW TRIBE MATES
TO VOTE OUT TWO OF THEIR OWN.
BRENDA AND SASH REIGNED
OVER THE NEW LA FLOR,
LEAVING FORMER
ESPADA PUPPET MASTER MARTY
STRIPPED OF HIS POWER
AND HIS IDOL.
GOING INTO THE MERGE,
THE YOUNGER MEMBERS
HAD THE NUMBERS, AND BRENDA
AND SASH STILL CALLED THE SHOTS.
 MARTY IS NOT
RUNNING THE CAMP.
SASH AND I ARE RUNNING THE CAMP.
 100%.
 Jeff:
BUT AS NEW ALLIANCES FORMED...
SERIOUS CRACKS BEGIN TO SHOW
IN THE OLD
LA FLOR CORE ALLIANCE.
20 CASTAWAYS SET OUT
ON THIS EPIC JOURNEY.
ONLY NINE REMAIN.
TONIGHT...
IN A SPECIAL EPISODE
OF SURVIVOR,
WE TAKE A DEEPER LOOK
AT HOW THE FINAL NINE
HAVE SURVIVED 27 DAYS
OF GRUELING COMPETITION.
NEW SCENES REVEAL
THE CONFLICTS, STRATEGIES
AND POWER PLAYS
THAT HAVE BROUGHT THESE NINE
WITHIN DAYS
OF BECOMING THE SOLE SURVIVOR.
 Jeff: THE OLDER ESPADA TRIBE
ARRIVED AT CAMP ON DAY ONE...
 WE DID IT, GUYS.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 Jeff: ...READY TO PUT THEIR
WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE TO WORK.
 I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE
HOW OUR OLDER PEOPLE HOLD UP.
 WE'RE THE UNDERDOG,
THE OLDER FOLKS,
BUT I HOPE
WE COME TOGETHER ENOUGH
TO WHERE WE CAN SURPRISE PEOPLE.
 SHELTER IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW, GUYS.
 MARTY'S RIGHT, SHELTER FIRST.
 WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, THOUGH.
 WE STRAY TOO FAR INSIDE,
MOSQUITOES...
 THERE'S LOW TIDE RIGHT NOW.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO CLOSE
TO THE WATER.
(\SEVERAL TALKING AT ONCE\)
 AS SOON AS WE HIT THE BEACH,
EVERYBODY STARTS YACKING,
YELLING, EVERYBODY'S EXCITED,
EVERYBODY'S BARKING ORDERS.
WE HAD ALL CHIEFS
AND NO INDIANS.
 CAN I SAY ONE THING?
THERE ARE SOME PALM FRONDS
AROUND HERE.
 HEY, HEY. HOLD ON.
I THINK WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE...
 THERE'S A LOT
OF TESTOSTERONE OVER THERE.
TYRONE WANTS TO BE IN CONTROL.
 TAKE A ONE-MINUTE
BREAK HERE, GUYS.
IF THE SHELTER IS HERE...
 JIMMY JOHNSON'S USED
TO BEING IN A CONTROL SITUATION.
 IF SOMEBODY WANTS
TO TRY AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO SPLIT A BAMBOO IN HALF,
I THINK IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT...
 MARTY LOOKS LIKE
HE WANTS TO BE
A LITTLE BIT OF A LEADER, TOO.
SO... LET THEM LEAD, YOU KNOW?
BUT GIVE ME A COUPLE
OF GOOD IDEAS ONCE IN A WHILE.
 WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS,
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
ABOUT HOW HIGH WE'RE GONNA...
 THE POWER STRUGGLE
HAS BEGUN, MAN; THE GAME IS ON.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ACT LIKE
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IN BUILDING A SHELTER, BUT...
THERE'S ONE GUY
THAT MAYBE KNOWS A LITTLE BIT.
JOE PESCI OVER THERE, I THINK,
KNOWS A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT CONSTRUCTION.
 WHO THE HELL EVER BUILT
A SHELTER BEFORE?
I WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
YOU THINK I EVER BUILT
A SHELTER?
 WE'RE GONNA SLEEP ON THAT?
 YEAH.
 WE CAN'T JUST SLEEP ON THAT.
 NO, NO, NO, NO.
FIVE HOURS, IT'S DAYLIGHT LEFT.
 OKAY.
 I'M ALL FOR...
WATCH IT, WATCH IT.
AND IT'S A BIT ENTERTAINING.
 WE MAY END UP
KEEPING THIS ROOF.
 JIMMY T.'S STYLE IS,
"LOOK AT ME!
I CRAVE ATTENTION."
 GUYS, LISTEN...
 I DON'T FEED INTO THAT,
'CAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE
A CRYING CHILD.
UNLESS THEIR DIAPER
NEEDS TO BE CHANGED,
IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO THAT
NONSENSE, THEN THEY'LL STOP.
 I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING IGNORED BY YOU GUYS.
 WE CAN WORK WHILE WE TALK.
 I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE ALL SAYING, WHAT IF...
ONE GUY GRAB EACH... ONE POLE
AND WE LAY IT UP HERE
AND WE GOT OUR STRUCTURE.
 I HEARD SOME RAH-RAH WITH,
UH, JIMMY T. AND THE SHELTER,
THERE WAS KIND OF
SOME YELLING GOING ON,
COUPLE PROFANITIES
AS I WALKED BY,
BUT THE GIRLS ARE DOING GREAT.
AND WE'RE WEAVING PALM FRONDS,
WE'RE OUT GATHERING WOOD.
THE BOYS HAVE BUILT
AND UN-BUILT THE SHELTER,
LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
ALREADY.
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG NIGHT FOR US.
 ONE, TWO, THREE!
 GO, GO, GO, GO!
 THERE IT IS.
 ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS GOOD.
ARE WE DONE?
CAN I GO HOME?
 Jeff:
THINGS WERE MUCH MORE RELAXED
AT THE YOUNG LA FLOR TRIBE...
 TIME TO SWIM?
 Jeff: ...WHERE FUN
WAS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE.
 READY, ONE, TWO, THREE.
 OKAY.
 SO I WAS, LIKE,
"HI, MY NAME IS BRENDA.
I'M TAKING DOWN, LIKE, I'M
GETTING IN MY UNDERWEAR NOW."
AS THE YOUNGER TRIBE
WE HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE,
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY.
ALL OF US ARE FIT.
AND WE'RE ALL
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
UNDERWEAR! WHOO!
THOSE ARE CUTE!
AND I THINK
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE
IS THAT WE'RE
GETTING ALONG SO WELL.
WE'RE IN NICARAGUA.
 I AM REALLY HAPPY
THAT I'M ON THE YOUNGER TRIBE.
WE'RE NOT REALLY
SET IN OUR WAYS.
LIKE, OLDER PEOPLE,
THEY'RE KIND OF, LIKE...
THEY'RE ALREADY
SET IN THEIR WAYS.
THEY THINK THAT
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING,
AND IT'S GONNA BE A LOT HARDER
FOR THEM TO BOND AND CLICK.
 THE LA FLOR TRIBE JUST WANTS
TO BE IN THE WATER, AND...
I'M WITH A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.
I WISH THAT I HAD BEEN
ON THE OTHER TRIBE,
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT SMARTER.
I BELIEVE THAT
THEY HAD A SHELTER.
I BELIEVE THEY HAD A DOOR,
PROBABLY A FEW WINDOWS,
A BASEMENT AND ATTIC,
BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE WOMEN
WERE SITTING UP THERE WEAVING,
WEAVING, WEAVING.
I KNOW IT.
THEY DO HAVE WISDOM.
I'M WITH YOUNG IDIOTS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
 HEY, DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER VINE?
 NOT AT THE MOMENT,
BUT MAYBE EVENTUALLY.
 Jeff:
BY NIGHTFALL AT ESPADA,
THE TRIBE HAD BUILT
SOME CAMARADERIE,
ALONG WITH THEIR SHELTER.
 TIE THIS ONE FIRST,
AND THEN I'LL PUT MY HAND
THROUGH THE TOP, AND YOU
HIT THE TARGET, ALL RIGHT?
 COME ON BACK.
 THROW ONE UP HERE.
 HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
 THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
 THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
I GOT A LITTLE UPSET
WITH SOME GUYS EARLIER.
 OH, HERE,
THERE'S A BUNCH RIGHT HERE.
 MAYBE THEY JUST WEREN'T
ELOQUENT IN THE WAY
THEY SPOKE TO ME.
BUT GUESS WHAT? I LIKE THE WAY
GUYS ARE STARTING TO STEP UP.
I THINK WE'RE STARTING
TO UNITE AS A TEAM.
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.
 GET IT IN, GET IT IN.
 IT COULDN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS.
ONE, TWO, THREE...
 ALL: ESPADA!
 I'M ABOUT READY TO TURN IN.
I'M DRUNK.
BUT THE GAME PLAN NOW
IS TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP,
'CAUSE WE WORKED
OUR ASSES OFF TODAY.
EVERYBODY WORKED HARD TODAY.
COMING IN!
(\YELLS IN PAIN\)
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH.
YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY?
WE GOT A RAMSHACKLE
SHELTER THERE,
BUT AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN ALL HUDDLE TOGETHER UNDER
AND TRY TO GET A FEW HOURS' REST
AND MAKE THIS PLACE
A LOT MORE LIVABLE TOMORROW.
 I MEAN, WHAT A DAY
TODAY WAS, HUH? SERIOUSLY.
SO FAR, SO GOOD, MAN, YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST GOT TO BE CAREFUL;
THIS GAME CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
IT'S NEVER WHAT YOU THINK
IT'S GOING TO BE.
(\ALL YELLING\)
 ♪ BWAH, BWAH, BWAH, BWAH. ♪
 HEY, THAT SOUNDS SO WRONG.
 STEW TIME.
-(BUMPS HEAD)
-Y... (GROANS)
 FABIO NEEDS A BUBBLE WRAPPED
ALL AROUND HIS BODY.
 Jeff:
BY DAY FOUR AT ESPADA,
CLEAR ROLES WERE ESTABLISHED
AMONG THE TRIBE...
 WHILE WE GOT EVERYBODY HERE,
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
A CONVERSATION.
 Jeff:
...WITH JIMMY JOHNSON EMERGING
AS THE GROUP'S NATURAL LEADER.
 FIRST OF ALL,
SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS,
WE GOT TO READJUST.
JIMMY T., HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
A SPOT LAST NIGHT.
 YEAH, WE GOT TO JUST
COME UP WITH A PLAN.
 YEAH, SO WE GOT TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF A PLAN
OF ROTATION.
TONIGHT I'LL SLEEP
ON THAT BACK SIDE.
 SO I GET TO SPOON
WITH DANNY TONIGHT?
 UH, NO, YOU SPOON... WELL, I
SPOONED WITH TYRONE LAST NIGHT.
 HEY, THAT SOUNDS SO WRONG.
 BUT YOU ARE MY BEST SPOON,
I PROMISE YOU.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I NEEDED A CIGARETTE
WHEN I WOKE UP.
(\LAUGHTER\)
 NO WONDER I WAS UP ALL NIGHT.
 Jeff:
AT LA FLOR, FABIO CAME IN
WITH A VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGY--
AVOID LEADERSHIP AT ALL COSTS.
 I CAME OUT HERE
WITH A GAME PLAN.
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO KIND OF STAY UNDER THE RADAR
AND SLITHER THROUGH THINGS.
I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY COOL,
STAY CONFIDENT,
BUT NOT BE STUPID.
DAMN IT!
 DID YOU RUB YOUR EYE?
 YEAH.
 REALLY?
 YEAH.
 I WENT
AND PICKED HOT CHILI PEPPER
BECAUSE OUR BREATH WAS
DISGUSTING THIS MORNING,
AND WE NEEDED SOMETHING
TO GET RID OF IT.
 OH!
 HERE, LEAN YOUR HEAD BACK.
 OH!
 OH, MY GOD,
IT HURTS TO OPEN IT SO BAD.
 ALL RIGHT?
 FABIO IS HILARIOUS.
HE ALWAYS GETS HIMSELF
IN A STICKY SITUATION.
HE ALWAYS GETS HIMSELF HURT
SOMEHOW.
 I TOUCHED THE SEEDS
AND EVERYTHING.
WILL THIS GO AWAY OR WHAT?
 I THINK FABIO NEEDS A BUBBLE
WRAPPED ALL AROUND HIS BODY
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
TO HIMSELF,
HE'S GOING TO GET AN OWIE.
HE'S STUPID.
HE'S AN IDIOT.
 I GOT TO WASH MY HANDS
BEFORE I TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE.
IMAGINE GOING TO THE BATHROOM,
TOUCHING THE CHILI AND THEN...
(LAUGHS)
(GROANING)
(URINATING)
 I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M ACCIDENT PRONE.
I MEAN, THINGS HAPPEN OUT HERE,
YEAH.
 THE YELLOW ARE REALLY HARD
TO PULL OFF.
(insects buzzing)
 CAN WE EVEN EAT THESE?
 CAREFUL, THERE'S A...
 THERE'S A BEEHIVE
UP THERE, TOO.
 THERE'S A BEEHIVE UP HERE?
(laughter)
 DO YOU SEE IT?
 AAH!
 Oh!
 (screaming)
 THERE'S, UM...
THERE'S ALL THE ANTS.
THERE'S ALL THE ANTS RIGHT
INSIDE OF IT.
MAYBE THAT'S CALLED
ACCIDENT PRONE, WHATEVER.
 HOW YOU GUYS DOING?
 HEY, GUYS.
(branch snaps)
 OW! AAH!
FREAKING THORNS, MAN.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GONNA
REALLY SEE ME AS I THREAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE,
"WELL, HE'S YOUNG, HE'S GOOFY,
AND WE'RE NOT
TOO WORRIED ABOUT HIM."
WHOA! STEW TIME.
YEAH... OW.
YEAH, BABY.
DOESN'T THAT... DOESN'T THAT
HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY?
I MEAN, WHY, NOT JUST ME,
I DON'T THINK.
(laughs)
OH.
 Jeff:
BY DAY NINE,
HUNGER AND FATIGUE
WERE ALREADY TAKING THEIR TOLL,
AND PARANOIA SET IN AMONG
THE OLDER MEMBERS AT ESPADA.
 I'M GONNA THROW THIS BY YOU.
HAS ANYBODY MADE AN ALLIANCE
WITH YOU?
 NO.
 OKAY, NOW, LISTEN.
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW
AT THE CHALLENGE.
THAT'S MY GUESS, OKAY.
I THINK WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN IS,
A LOT OF THE CITY KIDS, OKAY,
ARE GOING TO MERGE OVER
TO THIS TRIBE,
OR THEY'RE GOING TO PUT US
WITH THE CITY KIDS,
AND THE COUNTRY KIDS ARE GOING
TO COME OVER HERE.
THAT'S WHY NOBODY
IS MAKING ALLIANCES.
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN
TOMORROW AT THE CHALLENGE.
 HOLLY, I THINK
IS A VERY NICE PERSON,
BUT SHE'S...
SHE'S OFF THE DEEP END.
WHEN YOU HEAR HER TALK,
YOU CAN HEAR THE NERVOUSNESS.
YOU CAN SEE THE TENSION
IN HER EYES.
SHE FEELS THE SAME STRESS
THAT I FEEL.
SHE NEEDS TO DO WELL
IN THIS GAME, AND SHE'S NOT,
AND NOW SHE'S HITTING
THE PANIC BUTTONS.
I'M WORRIED THAT YOU'RE
OVERTHINKING IT, AND JUST...
RIGHT NOW, YOU SEEM...
YOU STILL SEEM A LITTLE EDGY.
 NO, THAT'S BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW I AM.
I THINK ABOUT THINGS,
AND-AND, UH...
 I KNOW, BUT IT'S GONNA END
UP... IT'S GONNA EAT...
STARTING IN HERE,
IT'S EATING AT YOU,
AND IT'S COMING RIGHT UP...
 I KNOW, I'LL DRINK
A LOT OF WATER. LISTEN, UM...
THE STRATEGY PART--
I AM NOT GOING TO LIE--
I STRUGGLE
WITH THE STRATEGY PART.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
OH, GOD, I'M TERRIBLE AT NAMES.
AND THAT'S ONE THING
I DIDN'T THINK
I WOULD STRUGGLE WITH
COMING INTO THE GAME,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I MAYBE OVERANALYZED IT
EVEN BEFORE I STARTED,
BUT, HOPEFULLY,
IT WON'T GET ME AT THE END.
SO DON'T WORRY.
 OH, I APPRECIATE YOU COMING
AND SHARING IT WITH ME.
 OKAY.
 'CAUSE I... IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
 I THINK
IT'S A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY.
 PRETTY STRONG POSSIBILITY.
 OKAY.
(thunder crashing)
 Jeff: THINGS WEREN'T MUCH
BETTER AT LA FLOR,
WHERE SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS
TESTED THE RESOLVE
OF THE ENTIRE TRIBE.
 I HOPE THIS RAIN STOPS, MAN.
GEE, IT SUCKS SO BAD, MAN.
 I'M JUST SO FRUSTRATED.
IT'S THE RAIN AND JUST BEING,
LIKE, WET AND COLD.
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN,
LIKE, WARM.
LIKE, EVERY NIGHT,
I'VE BEEN FREEZING.
BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS PUTTING UP
WITH IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME.
IF I WANT TO GO HOME,
IF I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER,
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK...
OH.
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THINK
I'M, LIKE, SUPER WEAK.
IT'S KILLING ME OUT HERE.
I JUST WANT TO QUIT.
24 HOURS OF THIS...
 IF YOU CAN GO THROUGH THIS,
YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANYTHING.
THIS RAIN IS HIDEOUS.
IT CAN BREAK YOU DOWN, AND
IT REVEALS YOUR TRUE CHARACTER.
JUST LIKE A GAME, IT'S TEN
PERCENT PHYSICAL AND 90% MENTAL.
SO, IF I HAVE
TO BE THAT GIRL'S ROCK
TO KEEP HER PROTECTED,
THEN I'LL DO THAT.
PURPLE KELLY IS AN IMPORTANT
NUMBER FOR OUR ALLIANCE.
AND WE'RE GOING
TO CARRY HER AS FAR AS WE CAN.
 WOW.
THE RIVER'S FLOODING
INTO THE OCEAN.
WE HAD QUITE THE RAINSTORM,
BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE RAINFOREST,
SO, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TO CRACK
RIGHT HERE AND GO IN.
WATCH THIS.
WATCH THIS PIECE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 KELLY PURPLE IS
A HUGE WASTE OF SPACE.
SHE BITCHES AND MOANS
ABOUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
 THIS IS SAD TO ME.
 SHE'S DEFINITELY INVOLVED
WITH BRENDA'S ALLIANCE,
AND I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR HER TO GO HOME.
 Jeff:
AT ESPADA,
JIMMY JOHNSON BECAME
THE FIRST CASUALTY
OF THE LEADERSHIP BATTLE.
JIMMY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
BUT THE WAR WAS FAR FROM OVER.
(rolling thunder)
(crashing thunder)
WITH JIMMY JOHNSON GONE,
THE REMAINING MEN
AT ESPADA ANGLED
TO FILL THE LEADERSHIP VACUUM.
 ACTUALLY,
WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD.
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD FIRE.
I'VE HAD A PLAN SINCE I ARRIVED
AND STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME,
AND MY GAME HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN EVER
SAY ANYTHING IN THIS GAME,
AND YOU CAN'T EVER BE
OVERLY COCKY,
BUT I'M IN CONTROL FINALLY.
I'M IN CONTROL OF THIS TRIBE.
 THANKS.
 HEY, MAN, WE SHOULD MOVE THIS
FIRE A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY,
'CAUSE THESE FLAMES--
ALL WE NEED IS A WIND,
AND IT'S GONNA
CATCH THE WOOD PILE,
AND THEN,
IT WILL CATCH ON TO THE SHELTER,
AND THEN WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.
 IT'S NOT GONNA CATCH.
 HUH?
 IT'S DEFINITELY NOT CATCHING.
 HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO SLIDE THIS OVER,
MAN, 'CAUSE...
IT WON'T HURT TO SLIDE IT OVER.
 UH-OH.  I'M NOT TRYING
TO IMPEDE ON YOUR SITUATION,
BUT I'M JUST TELLING YOU
FROM EXPERIENCE. I'VE SEEN IT.
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT
I DO FOR A LIVING.
YOU HEAR ME?
 YEAH, HE'S A FIREMAN,
I GET IT.
BUT HE FELT
THAT WE WERE IN A DANGER ZONE
AND THAT TOO MUCH
OF THE WOOD THAT I HAD NEARBY
WAS GOING TO CATCH FIRE
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
AND, LIKE, COME ON, MAN.
I MEAN, I KNOW
WHAT THE GUY IS ALL ABOUT.
HE LIKES TO HEAR HIMSELF SPEAK.
HE NEEDS TO FEEL
THAT PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO HIM
AS HE ASSERTS HIMSELF.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
 WHY TAKE A CHANCE,
AND THIS LIGHT UP,
AND THEN, THE WHOLE SHELTER...?
 YOU CAN BE MAD IF YOU WANT,
BUT I'M GOING
TO PUSH THE FIRE AWAY,
'CAUSE I'M NOT SLEEPING
IN THE RAIN
ANY MORE THAN I ALREADY HAVE.
I THINK MARTY IS PROBABLY NOT
USED TO TAKING A BACK SEAT.
AND I THINK HIS LITTLE--
WHATEVER--
EGO, HIS LITTLE PRIDE
OR WHATEVER, GOT IN THE WAY.
HE BLEW A LITTLE HISSY FIT
AND STORMED OFF
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.
WHEN I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE FIRE,
AND I SAID WE PROBABLY NEED
TO MOVE IT OVER, UM,
AND YOU SAID, "WELL, DON'T ...
THE THING ALL UP."
 WELL...
NOW, BUT IF...
NO, I'M JUST SAYING.
 WELL, WHEN YOU PULLED
THE WHOLE FIRE
THAT I'D BEEN CAREFULLY
CONSTRUCTING
AND EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU GOT
TO GIVE SOME CONSIDERATION
INTO THE TIME, EFFORT AND WORK
THAT I WAS PUTTING INTO IT.
 I'M GIVING YOU ALL THAT.
I'M GIVING YOU ALL OF THAT.
BUT I'M JUST TELLING YOU,
THERE'S A WAY TO TALK TO ME,
'CAUSE I TALK TO YOU
WITH RESPECT,
AND I FELT LIKE
YOU WERE DISRESPECTFUL,
AND IF YOU COME AT ME
DISRESPECTFUL AGAIN,
IT'S GONNA... I'M GONNA DO THE
SAME, AND IT'S GONNA BE UGLY.
 NOW YOU'RE THROWING A REAL
HEAVY, I'M DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU,
WHEN ALL I SAID WAS, "DON'T ...
WITH MY WHOLE FIRE."
I MEAN, COME ON, MAN.
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE EXAGGERATING?
 OKAY.
 AND THEN... AND NOW
YOU JUST GAVE ME, LIKE,
A DEFCON FIVE WARNING,
BASICALLY SAYING,
"MARTY, DON'T YOU EVER BE
DISRESPECTFUL TO ME AGAIN."
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
SOME KIND OF A THREAT IN THERE
OR SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T RESPOND WELL
TO THAT, YOU KNOW?
 AND IT...
 "HEY, MAN,
DON'T PUSH ME THAT WAY."
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA TOLERATE
BEING PUSHED THAT WAY, EITHER.
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"DON'T TELL ME I'M WRONG."
OR "DON'T TELL ME...
DON'T THREATEN ME, DON'T..."
YOU KNOW, THAT'S...
NOW YOU'VE STEPPED TOO FAR.
 HERE'S WHERE I...
HERE'S I THOUGHT...
 LET'S GET IT DONE, TYRONE.
I THOUGHT WE'VE MOVED ON.
LIKE MEN, I THOUGHT
WE HAD MOVED ON.
 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,
BUT WE'RE PLAYING THE GAME.
I CAME TO YOU RIGHT NOW,
AND I KNEW IT WASN'T GOING
TO BE AN EASY CONVERSATION
FOR YOU OR ME, SO MOVE...
 WHEN YOU THREATEN SOMEBODY,
IT USUALLY ISN'T.
 NO, IF I WAS THREATENING,
YOU'D KNOW IT.
IF I WAS, TRUST ME,
GAME OR NO GAME.
 I WOULD JUST LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO THROW DOWN TONIGHT
AND JUST HAVE HIM SEE,
"DUDE, HERE IT IS.
"OKAY, LIKE, WAKE UP, DUDE.
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE ROSES."
GUESS WHO'S GOING
TO BE THE NUMBER ONE TARGET?
 JANE-- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HER LOYALTIES WILL LIE.
 BEG, BORROW, STEAL,
WHATEVER I'VE GOT TO DO.
I'M GOING TO TRY
TO WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE JANE IS?
 I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU
TO THE END GAME.
 YUP. I DO KIND OF
BELIEVE SASH RIGHT NOW.
 HE'D BE ONE OF THE EASIEST
TO BEAT
AT THE END
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
 Jeff: AFTER A SURPRISE
TRIBE SWITCH ON DAY 12,
FORMER ESPADA MEMBERS WERE
SUDDENLY OUTNUMBERED
AT THE NEW LA FLOR
AND HAD TO SCRAMBLE
TO PROVE THEIR WORTH.
 FROM MIAMI.
 OH, OKAY.
 UH, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
 MY POSITION WHEN I WAS
ON ESPADA WAS TOTALLY SOLID.
NOW, COMING HERE,
UM, THERE'S FIVE OF THEM,
THREE OF THE OLDER TRIBE.
MY POSITION IS NOT SO GOOD.
 WOW.
 I LIKE YOU.
 FIRE LADY, HONEY!
 YOU FISH, RIGHT?
 I FISH.
 JANE, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HER LOYALTIES WILL LIE.
I THINK SHE MAY BE
BONDING WITH THEM.
SHE'S THE MOST
SKILLED PERSON OUT HERE.
I CALL HER "SURVIVOR MACGYVER"
BECAUSE SHE CAN DO ANYTHING,
SHE GETS FISH, SHE GETS CRAB,
SHE HAS BOUNDLESS ENERGY.
AND IT'S HARD TO ARGUE
AGAINST A FULL BELLY.
SO I'M VERY WORRIED THAT
JANE'S ABILITY TO BRING IN FOOD
FOR THE CAMP IS GOING TO BE
WHAT SENDS MARTY AND I HOME.
 ONE OF MY STRATEGIES
RIGHT THERE IS,
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
THE PROVIDER OUT HERE.
TRYING TO COME IN THIS GAME
AS FULLY PREPARED AS I CAN.
I MEAN, I STARTED...
KIND OF LIKE RESTRICTING MY FOOD
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,
JUST IN CASE I GOT ON THE SHOW,
SO THAT I WOULDN'T FEEL
ALL THE HUNGER PAINS.
NOT ONLY THAT,
I BOUGHT ME A SAUNA,
AND I STARTED SITTING IN IT
UP TO 170 DEGREES
SO THE HEAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.
I THINK THAT PAID OFF.
SO, HOPEFULLY...
FINGERS CROSSED,
WE'LL GET FISH TODAY.
IT WORKED!
WHOO!
I'M STARVING.
I WANT ME A FISH.
I'M GONNA EAT
THIS ONE I JUST CAUGHT.
EVERY NOW AND THEN, THE PROVIDER
NEEDS A MEAL. (\LAUGHS\)
WELL, JUST TOO LATE IN THE DAY,
NOT ENOUGH HEAT IN THE SUN.
I'M GONNA GO GET ME
A BURNING STICK OUT OF THE FIRE
AND SEE IF I CAN
SNEAK IT DOWN HERE.
 I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DIVERT ATTENTION
AWAY FROM THE CAMPFIRE
SO IT WON'T LOOK SUSPICIOUS,
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT
TO STEAL FIRE EMBERS.
 YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.
 SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO GO HELP HER.
 SOME OF THEM JUMPED OUT.
 OH, THEY DID.
 THEY DID. RUN HELP HER.
SO, EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS ME
KNOWS ME THAT
I'M A VERY HONEST PERSON.
HOW I PLAY THIS GAME HAS NOTHING
AT ALL TO DO WITH MY REAL LIFE.
I'M OUT TO WIN
A MILLION DOLLARS.
BEG, BORROW, STEAL,
WHATEVER I GOT TO DO,
I'M GONNA TRY TO WIN
A MILLION DOLLARS.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE JANE IS?
 OH, THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD.
I GOT ME A MEAL.
AND IT'S IN MY STOMACH,
NOT THEIRS. (\LAUGHS\)
 Jeff:
ON THE NEW ESPADA TRIBE,
THE ADDITION
OF FOUR YOUNG MEMBERS
FORCED THE OLDER TRIBE MATES
TO RETHINK THEIR STRATEGIES.
 WHO'S HERE FROM OUR TEAM,
FROM OUR OLD TRIBE?
ME, YOU, TYRONE, AND WHO ELSE?
 YVE.
 YVE. RIGHT. YEAH.
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY BEATING US.
 I DON'T, EITHER.
 NO, BECAUSE YOU PICKED
THE CREAM OF THE CROP.
 THANKS, DAN.
 WELL, IT'S TRUE.
BRAND-NEW GAME,
BRAND-NEW PEOPLE.
AS FAR AS STRATEGY, UH,
I'M PROBABLY...
I'M PROBABLY
SUPER VULNERABLE HERE.
I MEAN,
I'M THE OLDEST GUY BY FAR.
WHENEVER I GET IN FRONT
OF THE MIRROR NEXT TIME,
I'LL BE PULLING HAIR OUT OF MY
EARS AND SHAVING MY BEARD OFF.
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA LET IT GO
SALT AND PEPPER NOW.
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ALL SALT.
 IT'S PRETTY LONG.
 YEAH, LOOK AT HIS ROOTS.
 YAY!
 LET'S SEE YOUR HAIR.
 IT LOOKS LIKE A WIG.
 SIT UP, LET US SEE IT.
 IT DOES.
(\LAUGHTER\)
 OH, MY GOD, DAN!
 OH, NO WAY!
LEAVE IT.
 I HAVE A MAJOR STRATEGY NOW.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS, YEAH.
I'M TRYING TO GET IN
WITH THEM AND, UM...
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING... I'M
TRYING TO GET INTO THE CROWD.
I'M A COMPETITIVE GUY.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT.
THE KIDS LIKE ME, YOU KNOW.
BUT WHO KNOWS,
I COULD BE SCREWED TONIGHT.
THEY MAY BE PLAYING A GAME
WITH ME AND I'M GONE.
 SHOW UP AT THE CHALLENGE
LIKE THAT TOMORROW.
 IT WILL BE SO INTIMIDATING.
 YEAH, JUST DO IT.
 MOHAWK!
 DAN IS HILARIOUS,
AND HE'S TOTALLY VALUABLE.
HE'S VALUABLE BECAUSE HE'S WEAK.
HIS POSITION IS THE NUMBER,
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED HIM.
BECAUSE HE'S AN EASY NUMBER
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE'S WEAK
AND HE'S HAPPY
THAT WE KEEP HIM AROUND,
SO HE'S GONNA BE LOYAL TO US.
 THERE YOU GO.
 SEE THERE
WITH A NEW HAIRDO.
 THAT'S AMAZING.
 AAH!
(laughter)
(birds squawking)
 Jeff: BY DAY 16
AT THE NEW LA FLOR,
MARTY'S GRIP ON THE GAME
AND HIS IDOL WERE WEAKENED,
WHILE SAVE BEGAN A POWER MOVE
TO BECOME THE GAME'S
NEW PUPPET MASTER.
 SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS
TO HAVE YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH
WHAT THE THINKING WAS
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE THINKING WAS, AND...
 NO, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT...
YOU HAVING THE IDOL...
 YEAH?  ...MAKES, YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE NERVOUS.
 IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS
FOR ME TO DO ANY KIND OF MOVE
OR TRY TO LEVERAGE THAT IDOL
PRE-MERGE.
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,
I'M NOT CONTROLLING THIS GAME.
I'M NO LONGER
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
SO I'M ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
THAT'S THE BEST
THAT I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK
WITH EVERYONE HERE ON LA FLOR,
I THINK YOU MAY BE ONE
OF THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT MAY HAVE A 50-50 SHOT
OF WINNING AT THE END.
I'M TELLING YOU THIS
TO TRY AND...
 RIGHT.
 ...YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU
WHAT MY THOUGHTS ARE.
'CAUSE I'M NOT JUST
THINKING MERGE.
I'M THINKING ALSO...
 YEAH, CLEARLY.
 ...LONG TERM.
 SASH IS
A PRETTY SMART PLAYER.
AND WHEN HE LAID OUT HIS PLANS
FOR ME, I WAS, YOU KNOW,
FURTHER IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY
THAT HE'S THINKING
ABOUT THIS GAME.
BUT YOU CAN'T BE COCKY
OR OVER-CONFIDENT IN THIS GAME,
BUT I DO KIND OF BELIEVE SASH
RIGHT NOW.
 I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU
TO THE END GAME.  YUP.
 SO, LET'S GET FAR TOGETHER,
AND...
 I'M ALL FOR IT, MAN.
 THERE IS A LITTLE BIT
OF TRUTH
TO WHAT I SAID TO MARTY
ABOUT GOING TO THE END.
I THINK OF EVERYONE
AT LA FLOR RIGHT NOW,
HE'D BE ONE OF THE EASIEST
TO BEAT AT THE END
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
IF WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS,
THEN, WHY NOT GO TO THE END?
 FOR SURE.
 BUT I'VE BEEN MAKING
END AGREEMENTS WITH EVERYONE.
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF WE JUST KIND OF WATCHED OUT
FOR EACH OTHER'S BACKS.
YOU KNOW, I WOULD THINK
THAT WE'RE TOP FOUR?
I'D LOVE TO... GET ALL THE WAY
TO END WITH YOU.
 THANKS, SASH.
 I WANT TO MAKE A SAFE PACT
WITH EVERY SINGLE MEMBER
OF LA FLOR TO GUARANTEE ME
A FINAL SPOT IN THE END.
I SEE US MOVING--
YOU AND I PERSONALLY--
MOVING MUCH FURTHER ALONG
IN THE GAME TOGETHER.
 JUST LOVE TO.
LOVE TO DO IT, MAN.
 SAYING THAT YOU WANT SOMEONE
TO BE NEXT TO YOU
AT FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
AND PROMISING IT
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
COME FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THEY'LL BE IN
FOR A RUDE AWAKENING.
I THINK WE COULD REALLY DOMINATE
THIS GAME.
 I THINK SO, TOO, MAN.
 YOU REALLY SCREWED UP.
 MM.
 WHOEVER DID IT,
SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.
TO THEM OR THEIR FAMILY.
 CHASE AND JANE,
THEY'RE TIGHT,
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S SMART ENOUGH
 OR, LIKE, BOLD ENOUGH
TO MAKE A MOVE.  RIGHT.
 I JUST HOPE BRENDA AIN'T
PLAYING Y'ALL FOR A FOOL.
 Jeff:
ON DAY 19,
LA FLOR MOVED OVER
TO THE ESPADA CAMP,
AND THE TWO TRIBES BECAME ONE.
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)
LIBERTAD.
 LIFT IT UP.
(all gasping)
 OH, MY GOD!
 (screaming)
 RUM!
 NO.
 RUM. YEAH!
 Jeff: BUT THE CELEBRATION
DIDN'T LAST LONG.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: OLD ALLIANCES WERE
IMMEDIATELY TESTED,
AND NEW PARTNERSHIPS WERE FORMED
WHEN NAONKA COMMITTED
THE ULTIMATE CRIME--
STEALING FOOD.
 I SAW HER PUT THE FLOUR
IN THE BAG.
AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY.
I SHOULD HAVE CONFRONTED HER
RIGHT AWAY, AND I DIDN'T.
 THEY'RE SO STUPID.
 HEY, WHERE'S THE FLOUR?
 NAONKA, DID YOU PUT THE FLOUR
BACK IN THE CHEST
AFTER YOU USED...?
 EVERYBODY SAW ME
PUT IT IN THERE.
IF YOU DIDN'T SEE ME,
THEN YOU DIDN'T SEE ME,
BUT I PUT IT IN THERE.
 WE'RE JUST...
 THAT DOESN'T
JUST GET SWEPT AWAY
BY THE TIDE, YOU GUYS. LIKE...
 NO, I THINK IT'S PRETTY
OBVIOUS SOMEBODY STOLE IT.
 YEAH, THIS IS OBVIOUS.
 WHOEVER DID IT, SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM.
TO THEM OR THEIR FAMILY.
 THEY SHOULD GO HOME.
 THIS IS HOW I FEEL.
 YEAH.
 THIS IS ... STEALING FOOD.
 WHEN YOU HAVE
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE,
YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH IT.
SO SHE CAME TO ME, AND SHE
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO.
 ARE YOU GOING TO GO BACK
AND SAY SOMETHING?
 NO. WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY?
 I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO.
 SO HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION?
 YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
PUT IT OUT THERE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
 SO, YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT ALL
IN A PILE
AND JUST SET IT BACK HERE?
 MM-HMM.
 WELL, NAY, AS A MOM, OKAY?
 YEAH.
 THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU
IS, WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG,
IT'S BETTER TO CONFESS
AND SAY YOU'RE SORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET WAY FARTHER
IN LIFE.
SO, THAT'S THE ONLY ADVICE
I CAN GIVE YOU.
OKAY?
 OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING ABOUT HOLLY.
SHE KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF MY MOM, AND I RESPECT HER.
IT HELPS ME OUT A LOT,
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE HOLLY HERE
FOR AS LONG
AS WE COULD HAVE HER HERE,
UNTIL SHE'S... NOT VALUABLE
ANYMORE.
 WHY DID YOU TELL ME?
 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU.
THAT'S WHY.
AND IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME
TO SAY IT, 'CAUSE I ... UP.
 IT'S OKAY.
 I REALLY ... UP.
 I FEEL REALLY BAD.
 THANK YOU.
 IT'S OKAY.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
 OKAY.
 MY MOTHERING INSTINCTS
ARE DEFINITELY
KICKING IN WITH THESE KIDS,
AND IT KIND OF HELPS
BECAUSE SHE LOOK AT ME
AS, LIKE, A MOM FIGURE,
SO, YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY
HAVE HER ON MY SIDE.
 I'LL START IT OFF.
EARLIER THIS MORNING,
AFTER WE MADE THE TORTILLAS,
I DID PUT EVERYTHING BACK
IN THERE.
I DID GRAB THE FLOUR.
AND MY PURPOSE FOR GRABBING THE
FLOUR WAS TO MEASURE IT OUT
TO PUT HALF AND HALF
BECAUSE WE WERE USING
A WHOLE LOT OF FOOD, OKAY?
 I DON'T THINK IT'S STRANGE
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN GO NUTSO.
IF IT HAPPENS TO A WOMAN,
YOU EXPECT IT.
I AM SOMEWHAT OF A CHAUVINIST.
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THAT BROOKLYN ATTITUDE.
IF ONE OF THE GUYS HAD
DONE THAT, I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
TO JUST GET THE ... OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T COME BACK.
THAT'S FOR SURE.
LET'S GO GET IT
AND BRING IT HERE.
 AND SO, YOU KNOW IT WAS HERE.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
YOU DON'T...
 WELL, I JUST SAID
I DON'T REMEMBER.
 HOW DO YOU NOT REMEMBER?
 I JUST NEED A MOMENT
SO I CAN, JUST, LIKE, LOOK.
 NAONKA OBVIOUSLY WASN'T
THINKING STRAIGHT, YOU KNOW,
AND FOR HER
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
IT'S, LIKE,
I JUST HOPE SHE GOES HOME SOON.
AND THAT... IT'D WOULD BE FINE.
 IT'S SO IMMATURE.
I AM SO PISSED OFF AT NAONKA.
SHE IS WAY TOO EMOTIONAL
TO HAVE AS A CORE ALLIANCE.
IT REALLY MADE ME QUESTION
HER INTELLIGENCE
AND REALLY
WHERE HER FOCUS IS ON THE GAME.
SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PERSON
TO GO TO THE END WITH.
WHERE'S THE FLOUR?
IT'S AT A TREE?
 IT'S A TREE OVER HERE,
THERE'S AN ARROW GOING TO IT,
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT.
 YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT TREE?  NO.
 OKAY, THERE'S AN ARROW
ON THE GROUND.
 YEAH, I MADE AN ARROW
WITH STICKS.
 YOU REALLY SCREWED UP.
 MM.
 YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TRUST 100%
THAT OUR ALLIANCE
IS STILL STRONG.
WE STILL NEED YOU.
YOU STILL NEED US.
 YEAH.
 SO LET'S GO.
I WAS JUST SHOCKED THAT NAONKA
WOULD DO SOMETHING SO STUPID.
LIKE, YOU'RE IN A PERFECT
ALLIANCE,
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING GOING
FOR US,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO
PUT A TARGET ON YOUR BACK
WHICH HURTS OUR ALLIANCE.
LIKE, COME NAONKA.
STOP BEING SO STUPID.
IT COULD BE RIGHT HERE.
HERE IT IS.
 WHERE WAS IT?
 IT HAS NOT BEEN OPENED
SINCE THIS MORNING.
 WE GOT IT.  WE GOT IT.
 WE FOUND IT.
 WHERE WAS IT?
 OVER THERE.
 AT THAT TREE.
 YOU REALLY... YOU MISTAKED
OVER THERE FOR RIGHT HERE?
 YES, I DID, BUT I HAVE TO...
 WE GOT TO GET HER OUT NOW.
UM, I LIKE HER...
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT.
 Jeff: WITH NAONKA'S FLOUR
SCANDAL BEHIND THEM,
THE TRIBE TOOK TIME AWAY FROM
THE GAME TO LET THEIR HAIR DOWN.
 ♪ AND HE'S ALWAYS
MY VERY BEST FRIEND ♪
♪ I'M STANDING HERE
JUST TOO MONTHS PAST ♪
♪ AND I'M TALKING
TO HIS STONE... ♪
SINGING AND SONGWRITING
FOR ME IS THERAPY.
I STARTED WRITING SONGS
ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF
AFTER MY DAD DIED.
♪ OH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
GOD'S WAY... ♪
I THINK THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME,
YOU KNOW,
I'VE SHARED SOME
OF MY MUSIC WITH MY TRIBE MATES.
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE THE GUY
THAT EVERYONE KIND OF LIKES
AND TRY TO GET ALONG
WITH EVERYONE.
♪ HE WAS MY HERO ♪
♪ DAD YOU WERE...
LARGER THAN LIFE. ♪
 CHASE'S SONG ABOUT HIS DAD
GOT ME SUPER EMOTIONAL.
SINGING, AND YOU KNOW, MUSIC
ALWAYS HAS ALL THESE EMOTIONS,
AND I THOUGHT
NO ONE COULD SEE ME,
BUT, UM, I STARTED TO TEAR UP
A BIT
JUST-JUST THINKING ABOUT...
JUST THE WHOLE THING.
JUST SO MANY EMOTIONS.
 (humming)
 THAT'S ALL.
 (\APPLAUSE\)
 OH, THAT WAS GREAT.
 BUT I JUST HAVE
TO REMIND MYSELF
TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE GAME.
 MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE
THE SAME, EVER AGAIN.
 ANYBODY WHO WANTS
TO REALLY PLAY THIS GAME
AND WIN THIS GAME HAS TO DO SO
WITHOUT EMOTIONS.
 CHASE IS SUPER EMOTIONAL.
HE'S NOT THINKING
ABOUT THE GAME.
HE'S JUST TRYING TO BE NICE,
WHICH IS GREAT, GOOD FOR YOU.
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE YOU WIN.
SO YOU GO HOME FEELING
LIKE A GREAT GUY,
BUT YOU WILL GO HOME
WITHOUT A MILLION DOLLARS,
AND SOMEONE ELSE WILL,
WHICH IS FINE FOR ME.
 Jeff: BY DAY 27,
POWER COUPLE SASH AND BRENDA
WERE IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THE TRIBE.
 I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING
YOUR MAGIC, JUST LIKE I AM...
 EXACTLY.
 ...WITH ALL
THE GUYS AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
 EXACTLY.
 SO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT IT.  MM-HMM.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYONE
IS AS SMART AS WE ARE, EITHER.
 SO, UM...
 MM-HMM.
 I KNOW ALL THE GUYS LIKE YOU,
YOU KNOW.
CHASE IS DEFINITELY
ON THE OUTS WITH THEM.
YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER
HAVE YOU ON OUR SIDE.
 I'M ON WHICHEVER SIDE
IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR US.
 FOR US TO GET TO THE END.
BRENDA AND I BELIEVE
THAT WE'RE THE TWO
SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE GAME.
BOTH SHE AND I HAVE
ALMOST CAST A SPECIAL SPELL
OVER PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE
IN THE TRIBE.
SO BRENDA AND I HAVE THE POWER
TO SEND WHOEVER WE WANT HOME.
I'M, YOU KNOW,
TELLING ALL THESE PEOPLE,
SAYING, "OH, YEAH, FINAL THREE."
BUT YOU'RE REALLY THE ONLY ONE
THAT I CARE ABOUT GOING
TO THE END WITH,
AND WHOEVER OUR THIRD IS...
 DOESN'T MATTER.
 ...IS, WHOEVER, SO...
 WELL, BUT IT CAN'T BE CHASE.
 BRENDA AND I ARE
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
HOWEVER, WE BOTH UNDERSTAND
THAT WE'RE PROBABLY
THE BIGGEST THREATS
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS
AT THE END.
SO, ALTHOUGH WE'RE CONSPIRING
TOGETHER TO MAKE IT TO THE END,
I DON'T KNOW IF WE BOTH WILL.
 MY ONLY CONCERN RIGHT NOW
IS, UM, CHASE AND JANE.
THEY'RE TIGHT.
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S SMART ENOUGH,
OR, LIKE, BOLD ENOUGH
TO MAKE A MOVE.
 Jeff: BRENDA AND SASH'S
ARROGANCE WOULD PROVE
TO BE A SERIOUS BLIND SPOT
IN THEIR STRATEGY.
THEY WERE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
THE LIMITS OF THEIR POWER.
 I KNOW.
 I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE
AND VOTE SOMETHING AGAINST YOU.
 I KNOW
BRENDA IS WANTING TO GET ME OUT.
I THINK... I JUST...
 WE CAN GET HER OUT.
WHEN WE WANT IS THE ONLY THING.
 CHASE AND FABIO GRABBED ME,
AND THEY'RE, LIKE,
"WELL, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
A GOOD IDEA TO VOTE BRENDA OUT."
AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM, LIKE,
"SUCKER!
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?!"
YOU'RE A HELL OF A DUDE,
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BRAIN
UP THERE.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE INROADS
WITH FABIO TO OPEN HIS EYES UP
HOW BRENDA IS JUST GOING
TO USE HIM LIKE A PAWN,
BECAUSE SHE'S A BLACK WIDOW.
BUT FABIO CAN'T SEE IT,
CHASE CAN'T SEE IT,
BECAUSE SHE HAS HER MAGIC POWERS
OVER THESE YOUNG MEN,
AND THEY'RE FALLING FOR IT.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE BEST THING TO DO, MAN.
 I REALLY DON'T.
 WHO DO YOU THINK?
 HMM?
 WHO?
 SASH. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GONNA LET YOU GET TOO CLOSE.
 SEE, I LIKE SASH.
 I THINK SASH IS
THE BIGGEST THREAT AROUND HERE.
SASH DON'T WANT TO TAKE ME
OR YOU, PROBABLY,
TO THE FINAL THREE.
HE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
'CAUSE HE KNOWS YOU
OR I WILL WIN.
 LIKE, I WOULD RATHER
HER GO SOONER THAN LATER.
LIKE, SASH AND THEN HER,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
HOLLY AND EVERYBODY IS STILL
AROUND, ALL THE NICE PEOPLE.
 'CAUSE WE'RE GOOD. I JUST
DON'T WANT TO SEE EVIL WIN.
 I FEEL GOOD THAT, YOU KNOW,
WE PULLED YOU ASIDE
AND TALKED TO YOU.
 OKAY.
 ARE YOU TRUSTING ME
RIGHT NOW?
 YEAH, I TRUST YOU.
I MEAN, I DO.
I JUST HOPE BRENDA AIN'T PLAYING
Y'ALL FOR A FOOL.
 I DON'T WANT
TO VOTE BRENDA OUT.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S LIED TO ME.
AND IT'S...
IT SUCKS RIGHT NOTICE, BUT...
AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME,
YOU'VE GOT TO CHOP THE NECK
OF THE PERSON
THAT YOU MIGHT BE CLOSEST WITH,
AND IF THAT GETS ME FURTHER
IN THE GAME,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CHASE BROKE RANK
FROM HIS OLD ALLIANCE
AND SIDED WITH HIS NEW ALLY,
JANE.
THE BLACK WIDOW BRENDA
WAS VOTED OUT IN A LANDSLIDE.
BRENDA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
ONLY NINE CASTAWAYS ARE LEFT.
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: THE END IS IN SIGHT.
 WHAT?!
 Jeff: BUT THE CLOSER
THEY GET...
 JUST STRAIGHT UP LIED
TO ME AND YOU BOTH.
 Jeff:
...THE HARDER IT BECOMES.
 HE TALKS TOO MUCH.
HE'S PARANOID.
 Jeff: STRATEGY INTENSIFIES.
 CAN YOU SWEAR ON YOUR MOM
THAT YOU WILL NOT BACKSTAB ME?
 Jeff: CONFLICT ESCALATES.
 I WANT TO SEE THAT ...
WALK OUT WITH HIS TORCH DOWN.
 Jeff: WHO WILL OUTWIT
THE CUTTHROAT COMPETITION?
 IF WE STAY A STRONG FOUR,
WE DOMINATE.
 Jeff: WHO WILL OUTPLAY
IN GRUELING CHALLENGES?
FABIO FIGHTING FOR THE LEAD.
(groaning)
WHO WILL OUTLAST
THE EXTREME CONDITIONS?
(thunder rolling)
 Jeff: WHO WILL BECOME
THE SOLE SURVIVOR?
 AND THEN THE REST
OF THE GAME IS SMOOTH SAILING.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
(thunderclaps)
 Jeff: NEXT WEEK
ON AN ALL-NEW SURVIVOR...
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff:
AS THE STORMS GET STRONGER...
 IT'S LIKE CLASS-THREE RAPIDS.
 Jeff: ...NAONKA GETS WEAKER.
 AS IT RAINS AND IT POURS,
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE CRAP.
 Jeff: AND PURPLE KELLY
FINALLY HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.
 I JUST DON'T KNOW,
LIKE, PHYSICALLY,
HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN PUT UP WITH THIS.
 FISH, FISH.
 ALL RIGHT.
 (LAUGHTER)
 IT'S THE FISH DANCE.
 FISH DANCE.
 OH!
 FISH DANCE.
 IT'S THE FISH DANCE.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
