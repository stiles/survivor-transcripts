What was the ... point? He's literally an idiot. No one's gonna trust Q
 from now on. Karma is a bitch. JEFF PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... -...that now we could
pull off a blindside.
-Mm-hmm. KENZIE:
 Everyone is so distracted,
 I could drive something
that's a little risky. The idol has zero value
to me now. -I'm ready
to burn it on the spot.
-Right. CHARLIE:
 Tiff's gonna play her idol,
 so now we've got to figure out
 what the heck we're gonna do. -Yeah.
-Yeah. HUNTER:
 I'm beginning
 to feel pretty nervous. HUNTER:
 So I am 100% playing my idol. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol, and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Tenth person voted out and the third member
of our jury-- Hunter. Hunter, the tribe has spoken. Yes, they have. HUNTER:
 There it is in all of its splendor. LIZ:
 After Tribal Council, I was so ticked off. No one told me
 there was a split vote between Q and Hunter. And so I am trying to... hold my composure
so I don't explode, but I'm thinking, "What the heck, you ho-bags?" How y'all feeling?
Y'all okay? I just want to know
what is it about me that made y'all say,
"No, we don't want to let Liz in on the split vote"? VENUS:
Honestly, Liz,
everything happened ten minutes before Tribal,
and there was... -By the time...
-Is that true? -That is straight-up
what happened.
-That's straight-up. Well, damn. TIFFANY:
We thought he had an idol, and we was like,
"All right, well, just in case,
let's just split the votes." They're like,
"How are we gonna do that?" -We're like, "Well,
Liz is already voting..."
-LIZ: Okay. 'Cause I felt stupid as .... We said, "Liz is
already voting with you." Like, stupid as ... just now. Considering
 I was the only person left out of this vote, I feel pretty dumb. On top of that,
 I wanted to get Q out. He did almost blow up my game, and he's not someone
that I can trust moving forward. Hunter's also got to be crazy to
not see that blindside coming. If he had an idol,
he should have played it. No, he overplayed his hand
and he thought, "I can save this
for the next time because clearly
everyone hates Q right now." TIFFANY:
 Tonight, Tribal erupted
as Jeff predicted it would. Once again, Q was causing chaos, and because of that, it kind of threw Hunter
 off the scent. If he did have an idol, I guess
the smokescreen was so good that he didn't play it
because now our biggest physical threat
is on his way to the jury house. He's grown. If he wants to... If he wants to reconcile things,
he could come talk. At this point, my immediate
 next step is to get Q out. I'm tired of the drama,
 I'm tired of the chaos. That man did too much. He flew too close to the sun,
and his wings burnt off. And now
he's feeling the pressure. KENZIE:
Is Maria on the beach with Q? Yeah. Maria went
to go talk to Q, I think. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. -Okay?
-Come on. Come here. MARIA:
 Right now Q is, like,
 sitting back in the shadows. Q is sort of checked out
of the game mentally. But I think that Q still
 has some fight in him. So, for me, this is
a great opportunity to connect, but he's a wild card
at this point. I know, basically, I got
to win the rest of the way, and, you know, I'm cool
with going through like that. And when I lose,
if I go home, I go home. At this point,
 I think everyone wants me out, so there's no need
for me to go around and sit around the fire
and talk to these people. They really don't want
to talk to me. So I'm okay with that. Right now
 my strategy moving forward is, first win the immunity. If I can win, and now that
it's in the individual stage, I control my own destiny. I'm not out of this game,
 trust me. It might look like it,
but it's not. Yeah. Q is not only a good person, but, like, he's also a number
 that I can use to vote with me, and so I... I definitely want
to keep him around. (Maria mutters) MARIA:
 Q's an easy vote. Everybody wants him out,
 but in my mind there are bigger targets here,
 and so it may be time
to focus on somebody else. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (birds squawking) KENZIE:
Good morning. -Good morning.
-Good morning, Kenzie. Oh. How do you feel
about yesterday's vote? KENZIE:
I mean, I'm glad
it went the way it did. Like... I think we can. I know that
this is a hard thought for you, but I think Q would be willing
to work with us, um, in that,
he told me last night, "I'm a vote. Use me." MARIA: Yesterday
the plan was to blindside Tiff, but then
 we switched it to Hunter. But the biggest thing
for me is that Tiff has an idol. That's not a secret. And... Tiffany's sort of been
on my radar for a while. Evidently, she's still
 on Kenzie's radar, too, which is just music to my ears. -I want her gone regardless.
-Okay. KENZIE:
 Tiff has been my number one
 since day one. We have voted the exact same way
 this entire game. Tiff and I have made
every move together. We have played
 almost the exact same game, so I've got to differentiate. I've got to build my résumé, and a huge checkpoint on your résumé
is voting out your number one. That means I just need to be
 a little more sneaky than her to get her out first

 you're gonna race through a series of obstacles
 until you reach a sack of sandbags. You're gonna throw
those sandbags into a net tunnel and then use your hands
 to get 'em out the other side. Once they're all through,
 you'll grab one last sandbag, go under a net, crawl,
 and attempt to land that sandbag
 on a very tall target. First person
to finish wins reward. Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yes.

Applebee's. Gonna sweeten the deal a little.

And it's an overnight stay. -MARIA: Oh, my God. Wow.
-Wow. You have a lot of power
in the game and a lot
of strategic decisions to make. Choose one person to join you. Q:
So, Jeff, in my everyday life, I always
try to make things right. So, for my first choice,
I'm gonna choose Tiff. PROBST:
Tiff, come on over. VENUS:
Yay. PROBST: What an interesting
choice, given the last Tribal
where you two were done. Jeff,
I'm-I'm actually surprised, but I am excited because
I do feel like we need to talk in, like, a setting
where it's not high pressure, not a whole bunch
of people around and just really be able
to hash things out. PROBST:
All right, Q, choose another person
to join you. -I'm gonna beg.
-PROBST: Before you decide... I'm gonna beg. Please. PROBST:
Well, Liz is already begging. LIZ:
Please. Q:
The next choice
that I'm gonna make, Jeff, it's just based off, when I was out there by myself, there was one person that came
and checked on me, genuinely, wanted to know
if I was all right. So I just want to say thank you. And the next choice
I'm gonna make is Maria. -Thank you.
-PROBST: Maria, come on over. -Thank you.
-Yeah. (crying) PROBST:
All right, Q,
you have one more person. So it's gonna be four people
at the sanctuary for Applebee's, four people back at camp,
and you have one person, Liz, sobbing, has talked about food
this entire season, how she can't eat
certain things, therefore she's more hungry. But it's also
a million-dollar game with only a few people left. (Liz sniffles, cries) Q:
Liz-- she hasn't eaten, um, in almost 18 days. This is something
that she could potentially eat. But Kenzie was with me
since day one, um, and it's something
in me is saying, "Bring the family
back together." So my decision is basically going to be
to bring Kenzie. -Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Come on over, Kenzie. (crying) PROBST:
The Yanu three
is back together again after declaring they were dead
at Tribal Council. Q:
Sorry, y'all. (sniffling, crying) Liz, do you feel comfortable talking
about what you're feeling? (birds singing) I'm pissed! Y'all say
you ain't gone without eating. I see you eat every day! (sighing deeply) Q, you almost blew up
my whole game! You overshadowed
everything I was trying to do! And I said it's cool. I didn't say nothing! (Liz groans) I don't even want
to be around y'all! I'm just... Q... ...you blew up
my whole freaking spot. I didn't even know
about the damn -split vote last night.
-Q: But, Liz, you voted for me
last night, so... I made decisions based off
where my head is right now in the game. I'm sorry. (Liz sighing) LIZ:
I'm over it now. Thank y'all
for letting me have that. I feel better. I just exploded. I'm sorry. Back to your regularly
scheduled program. Liz, you don't have to apologize
for having your emotions. Obviously, missing out on rice is coming into play now. I haven't eaten since the merge. I've had zero calories
since the merge. But there's hope
in the game always. I don't even think I screamed
that hard during my divorce. (laughs, groans) All right,
here's what's gonna happen. Q, Kenzie, Tiff, Maria, you're gonna leave here,
go to the sanctuary. Applebee's chef is there
waiting for you. Fresh, beautiful
Applebee's food. You will spend the night,
get a good night's sleep, and return to camp
in the morning. -Head out,
enjoy a well-deserved afternoon.
-Thanks, Jeff. MARIA:
Thank you. Thanks, Q. PROBST:
Liz, Ben, Venus, Charlie, got nothing for you. Grab
your stuff. Head back to camp. LIZ:
 I am... so... angry. Q screwed me over.
 Not only am I not going on this reward,
not only am I not eating, but now I'm not feeling

but I ate the milkshake anyway." I mean, shut up. Like, read the freaking room. I'm just, like,
 all over the place. But as much
 as this not eating is making my mind kind of crazy, I do still have
my eyes on the prize. I'm sorry, Q.
I'm sorry I exploded. You're allowed
to express your emotions. I was just really hungry. So I decided to say I'm sorry for my outburst
 at the challenge. It's the biggest lie I've
ever said in this game so far because, honestly,
 I want to vote Q out. I was lying. I'm not sorry. I'm definitely not. I'm super proud of myself
for yelling at him. (chuckles) I will be having
a hot girl summer, though, when I get home. -Luckily, I...
-The Survivor diet. (chuckles) Be back to, like,
my tenth grade body weight. Q:
Liz apologized for her outburst, but I'm not concerned
 with what Liz thinks. I'm not ashamed
of going on a reward that I won. I can choose who I want,
 and, of course, there's gonna
 always be someone mad. (groans loudly) Q:
 Hey, it's a business decision. Uh, just like at home,
if I fire someone, I don't care if they're kicking
and crying on the floor. They have to go. So, at the end of the day, an apology out here,
you can keep it. -Okay. What's the quick update?
-All right. So Q proposed Venus, then Liz. -CHARLIE: Okay.
 -MARIA: And then the ladies proposed Q out first. CHARLIE:
 So, is the Tiff blindside off? MARIA:
 For now, but... I think that
it's all gonna come down to if Q wins immunity or not. -Okay.
-But what were
you all proposing? I-I was thinking
that it would be... Tiff. Is that what
everyone here was talking about? -No.
-Okay. -CHARLIE: Q.
 -MARIA: Okay. CHARLIE: That's all
 we were talking about. MARIA: After Q did not take Liz
 on the reward, everybody wants him out. The only thing that scares me
is that... Tiff has an idol. -Yeah.
-Which is why I'm like... -I don't know how long
that can be on the back burner.
-Right. The problem is,
 Tiff has an idol, and it's something that, like, we really have
 to get out of this game, but everybody is just like, "We want Q gone." But Q is causing chaos. And he proved himself capable
 of winning challenges. So if we have an opportunity,
he should go. MARIA:
I think if he doesn't win,
he's got to go. -Yeah.
-VENUS: I-I agree. Yeah. I made my feelings pretty clear. CHARLIE:
 Everybody is saying,
 "Beat Q at all costs." But for me and Maria, Tiffany
 could be more of a threat. So I don't want
 Tiffany to win either. So we need to make sure
that Tiffany and Q lose this challenge. Fo r yo ur m os t br il li an t sm il e, Crest has you covered. ♪♪ (laughing) Nice smile, Brad. Nice! Thanks? Crest 3D White. 100% more stain removal. Crest. [T en se M us ic ] One Aleve works all day so I can keep working

in the individual rice. Well, I mean,
if two other people want to step out, but I know this is, like, really high stakes. So let's just find out. Is there anybody here that's even contemplating it? No. PROBST:
Q? No? If I step out, I go home. I'm not dropping that bucket. PROBST: So, if we
don't make a deal today, it's safe to assume
we're probably -not going
to make a deal this season.
-Yeah. -All right,
Kenzie, you've stepped back.
-KENZIE: Yeah. So you're gonna compete. If the whole group was in it, I was gonna go for it,
but I think I'll be able to make it without the rice
because I can eat coconut. So I'm not judging Liz at all. I'm like, "Get the rice, girl." I would judge you more
if you didn't, honestly. -I would be like, "Just do it."

 that Charlie won immunity because, aside from the fact
 that I just want a chance at wearing
 the immunity necklace, I wanted to be the one to beat Q and send him home. He tried to destroy my game,
 and there's no way under this Fijian sun that I would let that go. I want Q gone. Charlie. Pulling it out. TIFFANY:
 Tonight is an easy vote. Myself, Kenzie, Charlie,
 Ben, Maria, Venus and Liz are all
 on board to send him home. I haven't heard a single person utter another name today
besides Q. -Liz with the rice.
-KENZIE: Whoo! TIFFANY:
But when there's idols in play,
 people start to act stupid. I need somebody to make fire,
honestly. TIFFANY:
 I have been doing a lot
 of debating about this idol because,
 now that it's out there, I know that the clock is ticking
 on when I have to play it. -CHARLIE: There it is.
-TIFFANY: Ooh. However, Q kind of blew up his own game and
has been causing chaos at camp. He's now the biggest target. He's a strong competitor. He's won the individual reward, and he's proven that, like,
he can beat us. Can somebody throw me a coconut? I think I'm gonna
crack one open. I'm a betting woman, so I'm putting my chips
 on the table and I'm making a bet. Tonight I'm betting I can keep my idol in my pocket
because Q is going home. MARIA:
...I'd love to get the idol out. KENZIE:
Yeah, I would
love to get it out, too, but if she plays her idol
tonight, and we all vote Tiff, -it's gonna be really,
really bad.
-Right. But let's just think. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It seems to be
that Kenzie is having cold feet. It seems to be that Kenzie
 doesn't necessarily think that this is the right time
 to make the Tiffany move, but if I keep sitting back and waiting
for the light to turn green... ...it may not turn green. So I'm gonna have
to run the red light. You're basically in final six. That's so awesome. As long as y'all not trying
to blindside me tonight. (both laugh) KENZIE: I have been working on
this, like, Tiff blindside thing on the side,
but it's just not singing the same heart song
it was to me. I have no respect for Q. I have no respect for the way
 he's playing the game. And I don't want
 to get out Tiff, who wants to be here,
 for someone who doesn't care. It's like spitting in the face of everyone
 who has ever applied, everyone who has
ever tried to be out here, in the face of the jury,
that he just doesn't care. It's annoying. TIFFANY:
 I don't know. Probably she giving him
 some type of encouragement -or something. I don't know.
-Mm-hmm. I'm the easy vote. But you could change that. Like, there are options, but, like,
you got to be in the game. I'm in the game. If you want to take Tiff out, there are options
to take Tiff out. Are you in or are you not in? Q:
 Tonight's vote is life or death, uh, for me. It's gonna be me or Tiff. I go to Vegas a lot,
 and I'm a high roller. I hope tonight I can roll nothing but sevens, and we can send Tiff home. MARIA:
 What are you thinking? Obviously,
Q is an easy vote, but... I'd love to get the idol out. We can take Tiff out tonight. While it may be hard
to work with Q, I think we're gonna
have to work with Q. BEN:
 I have been thinking
 about this vote. Q is a schemer
 and a bit of a bully, and I want him
the hell out of here, but... the argument
 for Tiff being the vote is that everybody
 knows Tiff has an idol, and the idol's more dangerous than Q at this point. I think we got to go
with the Tiff blindside. -Okay.
-Strategically, it's the most... -It's the smartest.
-Shh. MARIA: Now we have
 four votes to get Tiffany out, but in a game where there
are eight people left, that's not enough. -This is how we do it.
-Mm-hmm. Q is down to do Tiff. Okay. MARIA:
Maybe we don't tell Kenzie. CHARLIE:
I was thinking the same thing. We've got Q, Ben, me, Charlie.
That's four. -Thing is,
we need one more solid person.
-Personally, I think Liz is the better bet out of... -Liz, I don't trust her...
-But out of Liz and Venus, who do you trust more?
Venus I don't trust. -She'll cause some random chaos.
-BEN: Right. MARIA:
 Venus is not somebody
 I could work with, but the whole fight
 that Liz and Q had makes it really hard looping Liz into the plan. We only have
to get one more vote. I think Liz is better. MARIA: I want Tiffany out,
 and I want it to be today, but Charlie's right. Liz is the key person
 for this plan, and so our plan
is contingent on the person that has
 a personal vendetta against Q. But at some point you've got to make a move. And this is terrifying. It's terrifying
because it could blow up in my face, but it could
also be a game-winning move. (birds chirping) And I agree with that. Ben hates Q. Like, a lot of us don't want Q, but we have one chance. For Tiffany? This is the only night
that we can do this. -Okay.
-And you are the key holder. LIZ:
 Tonight's vote is making
 the wheels turn in my head. I think Maria wants
 to make this bold move for the jury, but I really, really dislike Q. Plus I have
a personal vendetta against Q because he didn't pick me
 for the Applebee's reward. I know Tiff has an idol, and that
 is something to consider. So it's gonna be
 a really hard battle between my mind and my heart. Getting Tiff out with an idol,
 without her even playing it, it's a huge, huge move. On the other hand, voting Q out, seeing Jeff snuff his torch would be just
 as sweet as that juicy, delicious Bourbon Burger. Like, peace out, brother.

-(laughs) -It's all good? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scared me. Okay. Let's review where the game is. Every single person
on the jury is there as a result
of a massive blindside. Q, you have been
an unwitting smoke screen the last two Tribals. So, once again,
let's start with you. Did the day center
around you a lot? A little? So, Jeff,
over the last three days, um, I've been calm. I lay on the beach.
If they approach me, good. If not, I don't bother people. Right now I have no power,
so I can only put the trust in the people around me. PROBST:
Tiff, this is a different story, 'cause the last two Tribals, everything
was swirling around Q. "Q's going home. Q's going home.
Q's going home." Nope. Still here. TIFFANY:
I mean, like Q said,
he kind of just sat back, minded his business,
and he has a keen understanding that, at this point,
it really just is what it is. And today at camp,
for probably the first time in quite a while,
it was actually peaceful. Kenzie, this
is eerily familiar, though. The last two Tribals,
there was this certainty that it was Q going home. Did it feel different today? Today definitely felt different. Q has been, like,
such a good smoke screen for if a blindside
is gonna get pulled off. But today we were all on a-- pretty much an understanding on
what was gonna go down tonight. So let's go back
to the reward challenge. -Biggest reward of the season.
-(whimpers) PROBST:
Q, you win. You're in charge. You choose Maria,
Tiff and Kenzie. Liz was left out,
was frustrated, understandably. It's a long game. She hasn't
eaten, and she let you have it. -(laughs)
-Q: Yes. -That's fair.
-LIZ: I mean,
I said what I said. I said it very loudly
and very publicly, but I didn't want it
to be awkward for everyone. So I apologized to Q. That don't mean I'm,
like, really that sorry. But, like, Q, you and I,
we just can't play together. Q, this is the story. I know, man. (sighs) It's tough, Jeff,
but, you know, I put out a plan, and if four others get on board
and help me out, we'll see where things kind of shake up. But the other folks
might just say, "You know what?
Kick this guy out." So, you know,
it's one of those things where it's not in my control. Ben, is it possible
that everybody could jump on board with Q's plan,
and it's not Q again tonight? Personally,
I'm just a bit over it, but, uh, if that does happen,
like, it's beyond me. 'Cause everybody has seemed
to have been on, like, "Q tonight? Q tonight?" I mean, it's almost eerie how
on board everybody is with that. Charlie, Ben said it. It's almost eerie. You can't not consider
the fact that something weird's gonna happen again,
because look across. The last two have been
absolute devastating blindsides using Q as the smoke screen. The eerie silence is scary. And I think
there was a moment today where I was
sort of questioning, like, "Is something going on
that I don't know about?" And what I realized is that, no, the calm is because
people are on the same page. So that's what
I'm hanging my hat on. Maria, let's talk
about blindsides at this stage of the game. If you're somebody
who pulls off a blindside, you're happy, you're proud.
You should be. You hoodwinked somebody.
That's difficult to do, but they're different
when you have a jury. I mean, I am sure everybody here is thinking to themselves, "How can I get
something on my résumé?" Right? Like, there
are three unfortunate people sitting over there
who are thinking to themselves, "Was this a good move,
or was it not? Am I gonna award
a vote to this person or not?" And so a blindside
right now is huge. That's just not
the case tonight, unfortunately. PROBST:
Tiff, let's go back
to Q for a moment. There's so much energy around
whether he should be here or not that I'm curious
when the scales tip and suddenly keeping Q
becomes the better move. (laughs softly) Um... PROBST:
Liz is...
Everybody's shaking their head. I don't know if keeping Q
is the better move for anybody. Just based on
what I've been hearing, I don't think
that anybody here thinks that Q is best for their game at
this particular point in time. Again, for me, Jeff, I can only put out an idea. If it doesn't stick
with others, it doesn't make sense for their game,
I can't make 'em vote with me. And I was prepared to go
two Tribals ago. If it's my time, it's my time.
I've accepted it. If my plan is not their plan,
