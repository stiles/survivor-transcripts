 to trust one another while also not trusting anyone, because you're playing

-Thank you. Yeah. I appreciate the morale. I feel like... -No. No. That's okay.
-No. I feel like we're all working
on keeping the vibe up. -Yes.
-And we could be,
like, the vibe tribe. -You know what I'm saying?
-(overlapping chatter) BEN:
 They were like, "Don't even worry.
Y'all stepped up." Which was awesome. So, at this point,
 my strategy's to be myself, which is to just chill hard
 to make everybody laugh. Hi, I'm Ben. OTHERS:
Hi, Ben. I'm an Aries. -Oh!
-(excited chatter) That's kind of my life. I've played everything from,
like, heavy metal to, -like, salsa
and bar mitzvah music.
-Yeah. -You know what I'm saying?
-Oh, fire, bro. A man of many talents here. -I could tell.
-Listen, you got to be
open-minded. TIM:
 Ben is, like, the vibe god. He's, like, the dean of cultural affairs, making sure that the tribe
 is in good spirits. (laughs) You got the vest on. Dude, rock it all you want. -Yeah, there you go.
-Yeah. -Oh, that's cute.
-That's not bad. I'm getting Ben's powers here. BEN:
I like this little workout. We're gonna get ripped. MARIA: I love Ben's energy.
 He has a lot of confidence. And with
that confidence, I think he gives us confidence
 in ourselves. JEM:
There you go! No. Chug, chug, chug. (screams) JEM:
 I feel like Ben
 is the epitome of Siga. We're surviving. (laughs) That's our thing.
 It's all about the vibe. And I think that's why, like,
 the Siga tribe get along so well. What about you? -We met at bar trivia,
to be honest.
-Let's go. Really? Yeah, in such a dorky way.
(chuckles) I'm this geeky, dorky nerd. Like, I love board games
 like D&D. I do crosswords. I do sudoku. I brew beer on the weekend. I'm aware that I'm a little
 out there, so I am... not everyone's cup of tea. For most of my life,
 I've struggled to make connections
 and to make friends. So I'm looking
 for this opportunity to prove to myself that I'm just not that loner. Like, I can forge a connection. -Oh, okay. There you go.
-Or when I'm running late,
Mo-on-the-slow. This is my tribe. This is my game. I'm not here to say, like, "Oh, no, they don't like me.
I'm done." No. I'm here to play my game. I do, too. Yeah. -Yeah, for sure.
-Do you feel good with me? -Oh.
-Genuinely? -Yeah. Do you feel good with me?
-Okay. Yes, absolutely. MORIAH:
I definitely connected with Jem. I also bonded
 pretty quickly with Maria. Surviving. (chuckles) Who are y'all
getting good vibes from? -I think everybody right now,
to be very honest.
-Everyone. But we need to maybe
start thinking, like, long-term. Especially if we don't want
a woman voted out first. -JEM: Yeah.
-MORIAH: Yeah. The women came together, so now I believe I have an alliance. I feel strong, and I trust
with them, but more importantly, I've made new friends. And it feels incredible. (laughing) Ha! -You got it, coach?
-Yep. (both grunt) (whoops) He's a he-man. (grunts) (groans) -Yes, sir!
-(cheering) Am I a good student, coach? -(laughing)
-Damn good student, man. -Yeah, okay.
-Okay. -All right, ready?
-Yeah. (laughing) TIFFANY:
 Maybe I should
 have did the Sweat task. I wouldn't have given up because
now we didn't get the supplies. We got to bang a coconut
up against the side of a rock to just get
 a little bit of juice out. It's hard, like, especially when you don't
have any tools. -Yeah. (laughs)
-Who needs a Sweat challenge when you got beautiful people,
you know? (laughing) I'm in the beauty industry.
I know what I'm talking about. I do hair and I own a salon. Building connections,
 building repertoire is literally
 my bread and butter. Like, this is a fast-moving game, and I am ready to,
like, giddyup. Are there three of you? A lot? Oh. Oh, my gosh. (laughs): What?! Q is an amazing,
 hardworking man. I'm like, "Let's team up." -(laughs) I know.
-(laughs) I got a good vibe from Jelinsky. We literally have
 two matching tattoos. JELINSKY:
I already thought
of our alliance name. What is it? Shaggy and Daphne. -(chuckles) You like that?
-Okay, I love it. Yeah. -This is a sacred bond.
-But... I agree. So I was like, "Hey, you and me,
we'll work together." We pinky promise. I definitely
want to be on your side, -'cause I want to work with you.
-Yeah, yeah. I mean, I want numbers, so...
And I want, like, people I like
to work with, so... I'm the queen of the tribe right now.
Everybody's calling me. My phone won't stop ringing. Everybody's like, "We should work together.
 Let's work together. Let's do this."
 Jess is like, "I get a good vibe."
I'm assuming that's her way of saying
we should work together, but I can't tell
 if it's the truth or not. No one's talking to me. I mean, you haven't
really talked a lot of strategy. Yeah, I don't know. I'm playing a slow game. KENZIE:
 Jess doesn't really
 want to talk strategy, and no one can get
 a read on her. I tried. I tried talking to her.
There wasn't much there. I tried to talk to Jess and
be like, "Who-- What are you-- -Have you talked to anybody?"
-Yeah. Literally. It's, like, -she was so hesitant, like...
-She was like, "About what?"
And I was like... Yeah. KENZIE:
 Tiff, that is my girl. We kind of
 have this girls thing, apart from the big thing, that's the four of us-- Q, me, Tiff and Jelinsky. So, we like this. -Uh...

Whenever you guys can, like, maybe help me

I called you "princess." -At that moment.
-I did, too. So funny,
but I said, "Princess U.S.A." But you're Canadian, so... VENUS:
One of the things I was afraid
of, coming into this game, was that people
would think I'm a princess. I'm anything but. That's right. Don't ever let somebody -tell you
that princess is-is bad.
-LIZ: Amen. VENUS:
 Tevin called me out
 right in front of everyone, saying, "You are a princess." I know I'm on the bottom
for that fact alone. But then I thought to myself,
 "You know what? Screw it. I'll just
 play as hard as I can." I'm not gonna go out
without a fight. I have to start being sneaky and looking for advantages
 and finding the immunity idol, 'cause if I can't find it,
 it's my ass going home. Throw a girl a bone, Jeff. I'm desperate. Venus is the goddess of love, but she's married
 to the god of wrath. So when
 I'm being underestimated, you are gonna see me
 become a dangerous player-- someone who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty
 and cause chaos. Aah! Big spider. I'm already envisioning myself at final Tribal Council
 saying "screw you" to everyone who underestimated me
 the first day and thought I was some princess who wasn't
gonna get anything done. I'm not stupid.
 Venus was clearly looking for an advantage or an idol,
 and I caught her. I knew off the bat that Venus was going
to be the number one threat in my tribe. It's so obvious to me.
 She's very sociable, very charismatic,
 she's dangerous. So I have to make sure that she's exploited as a threat. -RANDEN: Well, I mean...
-How are you feeling? I'm solid, but my gut tells me that Venus right now is
just playing super aggressive. -You're afraid of her?
-Not afraid of her. No, that was the wrong word. -Yeah, I'm not afraid.
-Wary, wary. But I know a Parvati Light
when I see a Parvati Light. Yeah. If homegirl had a chance,

 how forward he's being, but my Sodar's going off, like... ♪ Beep, beep, beep,

 your looks against you.
 -Oh. And he said, "I know a Parvati
when I see one." VENUS:
 Parvati was a player who was charming and smart as hell, and she even
 won a million dollars. So, Randen calling me
 a Parvati is a compliment 'cause I love strong women. -That's fine.
-And he... -That doesn't faze me
at all, honestly.
-Exactly. VENUS:

card is right here. -Okay.

though, like, I have the vote card. I'm not lying to you. TEVIN:
I would hate for you to lose your vote,
is what I would hate for, and I'd hate to lose my vote,
so I'm pleading that you pick this so
that we can have an extra vote. 'Cause if you pick that one, my God, today,
you might be disappointed. MARIA:
 There's something in my gut that's saying, "Jelinsky's
 lying," but I'm not 100%. So, my heart was pounding
 out of my chest because if I choose wrong,
then I'm gonna lose a vote. -All right, so...
-I'm so sorry. Let's talk about this. If, and you're being honest
with me, Tevin, -I'm being 100% honest.
-then I can trust that we can work together. But Jelinsky, losing my vote
would not be good. So, if I find out
that you were lying, I will have to go back
and tell my tribe the deceit. -Ooh.
-MARIA: So, I'm gonna give you all
another chance. You know what?
I'll-I'll be honest, 'cause I'm not
"deceptful" at all. I-I do have the skull card. Don't pick it. You know, this is
a nerve-wracking thing. So you're saying
you have the skull card? I do. I have the skull card. TEVIN:
 Lord have mercy. He literally folded his cards. Jelinsky has, in this moment,
just given up his vote. But Maria and I get
 an extra vote. -Should we shake hands on it?
-Shake hands?
-Shake hands. -Go like this, do it this way?
-Shake hands?
-Uh-huh. -I'm sorry I was deceptive.
I was scared.
-That's okay. It's because of me
 that Jelinsky totally quit. Like, I felt super
on top of the world. It felt super powerful. JELINSKY:
 Growing up in Las Vegas, you got to know
when to hold 'em, you got to know
when to fold 'em, you got to know
when to walk away. And it was my time
to fold 'em and walk away. I'd rather lose my vote

to strangers. So you're the only person
that lost the vote? Right. And they both
have extra votes now. -Okay.
-It was a bad situation. I felt so bad. I just felt
obligated to tell the truth. BHANU:
 Jelinsky--
 he gives up too quickly. Are you kidding me? This is Survivor. You cannot give up like that.
Have you seen Jeff talk to you? You got to dig deep. Hello. CHARLIE: I can't figure out
why Jelinsky would say that. MORIAH: You mom'd the heck
out of this, man. -Yeah, you did. Yeah.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:
And so, I will get an extra vote -at the next Tribal Council.
-TIM: Good job, Maria. -Yeah.
-KENZIE: Yeah. -Hey!
-It was fun to do that.
-CHARLIE: The torch. MARIA:
Oh, my God. -BEN: Yeah, he's crushing it.
-(Maria laughs) Yeah, I'll try to grow out a
mullet while I'm out here, too. BEN:
Yeah, exactly. (laughing) TIM:
Maria's extra vote-- it is scary because I want
 to get one of the ladies out. But now the women can dominate in this game
and take out the guys. So, this is really, really bad. JESS:
 Since we got here,
 I have no idea if I slept. And last night,
I went straight to the shelter. When I tried to lie down, lay down... Lied down? Laid down. And that did not go well, either. (wood snapping) -You okay?
-(laughing)
-TIFFANY: Hello. -No, I'm good, I'm good.
-Q: It can hold on its own. I don't think I've slept at all. I'm, like, running on empty.
I don't sleep at night. Without sleep,
you're not gonna be strong. No, and I can't even
think straight. I got my ADHD diagnosis
in the last couple of years, and it's-it's been
 difficult out here. On such little sleep
and food and water, it's making me kind of...
It's making my head spin. And I feel like
 it's, like, affecting me in worse ways than I imagined. Oh, my God.
I lost my water bottle. -Q: You lost it again?
-This always happens to me. This is my nightmare,
coming out here, is that I would lose my stuff. I'm losing things,
 like, all over the place. My ADHD is, like,
 messing everything up. I feel like I have to kind of
shrink a little bit and not be as, like...
take as much social initiative
 as other people do. That is not a good strategy.
 Like, I need to take
a little bit more initiative. No, and I'm scared to
because of how I am! I would lose them
in a shopping mall. BHANU:
Oh, no. JESS:
I am scared to have kids. -BHANU: Oh, man.
-You can just be,
like, one of those -leash moms who has their kids
on a leash.
-JESS: I know. I need... No, they should
put me on the leash. (laughing) JESS:
 I have to be going out
 and, like, not be scared to talk strategy to people. I even feel scared to go out idol hunting.
 Oh, my God. If I found an idol,
I would lose it anyway. BHANU:
 I'm not trying
 to be sketchy, but I'm always looking for an idol. It's extremely stressful because I don't want to be caught. I don't want
to be caught doing this. (vocalizing) All right. Where are you hiding? And I've been looking
 high and low everywhere. It's super hard. Why-why do they make it look
so, like, easy? -They make it so easy
on TV, man.
-Yes. BHANU:
 Everyone's searching
 for an idol, but I don't want anyone
 to find an idol before me. Calm yourself down and think. I'm gonna find that guy.
I'm gonna find that idol. (whispering):
I found something. Yo! It's a Beware Advantage. TIFFANY:
 Not for one second
 did it cross my mind to put
 the Beware Advantage back. This is mine.
I earned it, I found it. I don't care what's in here. I'm doing it or I'll deal
 with the consequences. I didn't come out here to play scared. People who play scared go home. Girl, we got to go back. Where'd you find it? TIFFANY: I read the clue
 real quick, and it says I got to go back to the spot
where I found it and dig a hole. We digging, digging,
 digging, digging. Pull out this big box
 with a lock on it. All right. -Yeah, you did lose your vote.
Your vote is gone.
-Okay. -Damn. All right,
I got to bury it.
-You got to bury it back. TIFFANY:
 So until I have the idol,
 I can't vote. "That's why it says beware." (laughs) (shrieking):
 Ah! But if we lose
 an immunity challenge, I have to return to that spot.
 There better just be a key waiting there for me
and not no extra stuff. If we have to tell the boys,
we have to tell the boys. -They're are numbers. It's fine.
-Okay. It's fine. TIFFANY: The more people
 that know about the idol, the more messy it's gonna get. But, I mean,
it's a Beware Advantage, right? So this is the kind of advantage
 that you kind of need people to be on your side for. I don't have a vote. I found
a Beware Advantage today. -You don't have a vote?
-I don't. So if Jelinsky loses his vote,
and I lose my vote, it's y'all two, Jess and Bhanu. -Do not tell Jelinsky.
-I'm not telling him anything. TIFFANY:
 I don't care
 if I don't have a vote. I'll figure it out. I ain't nervous at all.
You can't be nervous. We only got 26 days. Who got time to be nervous? [t ra ff ic n oi se ] [Text Message]

-Probably gonna kick back for a little bit. There's no stopping in the game of Survivor. We got to vote tonight. We got to make sure
 we're locked in, and I'm going into
 Tribal Council without a vote. But I do feel pretty confident because I feel like
 I have a great alliance with Q, Kenzie and Tiff. We have a solid four. All of my allies
are locked in with me. I did want to just chill out
for a little bit. Really? You think
that's better for your game than going where everyone is? (laughs) -How are you feeling?
-Scared. I'm, like,
one of the smallest people here. Yeah. I mean, I know our names
are on the block. My name is on the block? I just figured
'cause we were at the puzzle. I think Jess has
 to be the first one to go. I just wanted to make it seem
 like I'm nervous because I do not want Jess playing
her Shot in the Dark tonight. And if I could get
 Jess out of here without even casting a vote? Oh, my God. That's Survivor legend status to me. I just want y'all to know
I don't want any of you going home, period. BHANU:
What is the plan, then? So, the real plan is Jess. The fake plan that
we're telling Jess is Jelinsky. TIFFANY:
 People want Jess
 to be the first vote, right? Me included.
 The vibes don't... They not vibing
 when I talk to Jess. And I'm really bummed that we lost the immunity challenge. Psych. I don't care.
I'm happy we lost the immunity challenge. Now I get further instructions
 for the idol. Okay. TIFFANY: And I needed
 to have my vote back because your vote is your voice in this game. Girl. I got to crack this message
to find the location of the key. My heart sank. When I opened it up,
it was a friggin' puzzle. And now I have
 to decode this alien language to figure out where my key is. All right, let's see.
I think this word is "the." So that means this is T. Maybe this is O. I mean, I love it. I don't know where
your brain's at, but beautiful. TIFFANY:
 I am a visual artist, so, doing the puzzle--
 it's just like a friggin' light bulb just
went off in my head, and I just started rolling through it. TIFFANY:
 But then, of course,
 here comes Q and Bhanu, curbing the corner. So I knew I had to boogie. I had literally two words left. Oh. Oh. "Point." "Your key is tied to a rock in the shallow waters
at the point." What is the point? I run over there to the point or what I think is the point,
 and I'm just turning over every rock. Oh. Behind a rock. I'm turning over everything.
 Crabs jumping out at me, all kinds of crap. I'm sweating bullets. (gasps)
Yes! Oh! Yes! Yes! I untied the key,
 and I hauled ass. Oh, my God. (gasps)
Yes! (whispers): Yes! Yes. Yes. I had to work for this. Survivor bucket list item...
achieved. This is a real, true idol. -No catches. -KENZIE: Whatever you're doing, you have to do it quick. -You got it?
-Yeah, I got it. -You did?
-I did. Now, I mean, unless some talks are happening right now
that I don't know, it's looking like
 Jess to go home. When you don't deliver
time and time again, in my world, you get dismissed. Where I come from,
 hard work is respected. Jelinsky talks a good game,
 but doesn't show up to play. I don't need talkers. I need soldiers who's willing
to go to battle, do the job. I can't go to war with him. JELINSKY:
I want our four to go deep. Me too. I mean,
it's kind of our only option. I think we could
seriously run things. Q:
 A lot of folks think
 Jess is going home, but I'm writing
 Jelinsky's name down. Big letters. I don't know
how to spell it yet, but his name will be
written down, from me, tonight. I cannot have Jelinsky
to come back. Q: Correct. -And then, Jelinsky,
I don't trust at all.
-Correct. JESS: Q's saying
 Jelinsky's the target, but I'm very nervous about tonight.
Nobody wants to be the first person
 voted out and, like, I was a common denominator
 in our puzzle failures. Maybe they're trying to,
 like, butter me up just to vote me out. I think it will benefit us to
get Jess first, then Jelinsky. Jelinsky has told us he can do
everything under the moon. So what is he good at?
He's weak. I don't know
if Kenzie's gonna go for voting Jelinsky out first. Maybe we might have
to think about this. What Tiff is saying
is also super valid. -Yeah.
-It's super, super valid. I don't know. I'm so... I'm so torn. I like Jelinsky.
 I like that kid. -I'm a little nervous.
I'm just...
-Here. BHANU:
 And I really like Jess. Come here. BHANU: She's the one
 who's consoling me, but I'm gonna
 suck up my emotions, drain my tears, just put the name on the parchment
tonight and be at peace with it. I mean, Jess was a little better
at the puzzle today. Jelinsky was looking like a deer
in the headlights. -BHANU: Yeah, but...
-KENZIE: But we wouldn't
have gotten to the puzzle without Jelinsky.
We need to look at the standard of who's gonna
be able to carry us, literally, through challenges. Jess is our weakest
in the physicality realm... That's me, personal. KENZIE:
 Oh, my gosh. It's a mess. We aren't on the same page.
 Like, what should we do? Jess isn't really
 bringing a strength. And sure, she's sweet, but it's really hard
to work with someone that you can't get a read on. But then, with Jelinsky,
I don't want to play with people who just give up.

messing with my ability to process information. PROBST:
Is it because you're
choosing not to sleep or you just can't
physically get... JESS:
I can't physically sleep,
and I thought that I would
be physically exhausted enough because we've all been
working so hard. I thought that I would be
physically exhausted enough to just, like,
go out like a light, and that's how I usually am
at home. PROBST:
I want to circle back
to the Sweat task because I still have some
questions about what happened. Q, walk me through it. Q:
So we had to, Jeff, climb up Mount Everest, climb down Mount Everest, go into the ocean
with holes in a bucket, and we're like, "Oh, my. What has Jeff
put us through now?" So, we decided to not finish it
with maybe about two hours and 45 minutes left. PROBST:
So, Jelinsky, I got a slightly different story
from you today. Honestly, Jeff, Q and I
share the same mentality. We're the type of dudes
to not give up on anything. -You know? If...
-PROBST: Wait a second. That's an impossible statement
to make given that Q said you just gave up. Okay.
I see your point, Jeff, but I'm saying if we had all day to fill up that damn bucket,
we would have. PROBST:
Jelinsky, what's
fascinating to me is the reluctance to own
that you quit. You're right.
We quit the challenge. There's no way around it, and
I'm gonna own up to it now. We quit the challenge,
and that's that. Okay, let's move on
to the journey. Jelinsky, you go
on this journey. -What happened?
-JELINSKY: Honestly, Jeff, I was so excited to go, but lo and behold, Jelinsky doesn't have
a vote tonight. And Jelinsky has never talked in
third person in his life before. -But tonight,
it especially sucks.
-Let me... let me step in.
He gave his vote away. Again, a different version
of a story. Q:
He gave it away.
He traded his vote for them
to have two extra votes. It's not good in my books. JELINSKY:
I was in a tough spot. You know, I'm not
a deceptive person, so I realized the cards were
literally stacked against me. There was not much I could do. In fact, them having
extra votes might work to our advantage one day, and
we'll just have to wait and see. JESS:
How would that work
to our advantage one day--
them having extra votes? They might want
to work with us and say, "Hey, you guys vote this way,
I'm gonna use my extra vote, and we're golden." Maybe they're not
gonna vote you out, but we ain't give them
them extra votes. You did. It's a game
for a million dollars, Jeff. We're not handing out favors. PROBST:
And, Jess,
that's part of the design of a journey. What do you do
when you're alone? -Yeah.
-Do you make a decision
that's good -for the group?
-Yeah. But... I don't know. (laughing):
Come back to me in a second. PROBST:
Are you really struggling -right now?
-JESS: I am really struggling. Like, my brain is, like,
somewhere else right now. Like, and I must have said that
the first day, but it's, like,
really somewhere else now. I'm like mush mouth.
I, like... I... I can't even
string sentences together. PROBST:
I'm fascinated by -how open you're...
-JESS: I'm an alien. I don't
understand myself, either. PROBST:
And, Jess, it happens
to a lot of players, and it sometimes never goes away. -You just can never catch up.
-God. -Yeah.
-So you're struggling
with even something as simple -as spelling your name.
-JESS: Yeah. Don't learn how
to spell my name, please. (laughing) -PROBST: So, Kenzie?
-KENZIE: Yes. PROBST:
We're only three days in. Where is this tribe right now? KENZIE:
Well, it's difficult, because we have lost everything
together. We've gone through it all
together. You get super close super quick. And now we have
to cut someone out. It's... it's tough. PROBST:
So, Bhanu, how do you make that first decision
about who to send home? (sighs) This is a challenging vote
for me. Um, I want to work with someone who's gonna be good socially, not someone who's not giving any clue of what's going on
in their mind. PROBST:
How about for you, Tiffany? TIFFANY:
For me, it comes down
to one thing. What four people can I go back
to the tribe with that's not gonna put me back
here again in a couple of days. -I don't care
about nothing else.
-So you're talking about -tribe strength in challenges?
-TIFFANY: Yeah. PROBST:
And Jelinsky, that's one of the fundamental dilemmas
of Survivor, is tribe versus self. JELINSKY:
One hundred percent. I
understand what they're saying. I am still 100% into this tribe. Like, I want
to stay in this game. I just don't want my efforts
to be lost in a decision like a journey,
and I will never, ever give up in a challenge. Except for the Sweat test. (laughing) -And the journey.
-And the journey. (laughing) Thank you for reminding me. (laughing) Jess, given what some
of the people have said they're looking for
in a tribemate, are you worried
that your inability right now to form sentences-- do you think it's impacting
your ability to connect -or do you feel solid?
-JESS: No. This
is only happening in, like, public settings, but in my one-on-one or, like,
smaller groups, I think I'm a lot more coherent because I do feel like
I'm delivering at camp and I do feel like I'm
delivering at the challenges. Even though I just shouldn't
have volunteered for the puzzle. -Yeah. Again.
-JELINSKY: Jeff, I think Jess and I are definitely
in the same boat. I feel like a lot
of the pressure is on us, especially being the common
denominators in the puzzle. PROBST:
Jess, he is determined
to get you -in this boat with him.
-JESS: I don't want to be in that boat! I feel like
I worked really, really hard. I do not deserve
to be in that boat. Jeff, I don't
have a vote tonight, so maybe I am
subconsciously deflecting. But I love Jess.
Like, Jess is awesome. -Thank you.
-You're welcome. -(laughing)
-I'm a nice guy, man. I don't like fighting. I don't
like being the center.... Nobody thinks
you're not a nice guy. -We love you.
-We all think you're a nice guy. -I know.
-BHANU: Jeff, I love this kid. Like, I...
This kid is really awesome. But I don't know
how the tribe is feeling. Is it too little, too late? Like, I don't know, so... So you're feeling in your heart
that it's Jelinsky tonight? It's time to vote? (laughing) -Oh, ...
-(laughing) I don't know
if I'm ready for that, Jeff. TIFFANY:
Hey, yo. -Oh.
-PROBST: Wow. Jelinsky. That did not sound good. JELINSKY:
Jeff, all I know is, as long as I'm in this game,
I'm giving 100% effort in every single challenge we do, and I just want us to be
the strongest tribe possible going forward. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Kenzie, you're up. Wow. This is so beautiful. Oh, I never want
to see another gecko again. (sighs) (sighs) Oh, my God. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. All right.
I'll read the votes. First vote: Jelinsky. Jelinsky.
That's two votes Jelinsky. First person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jelinsky. That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. Jelinsky, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.
