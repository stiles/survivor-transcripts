I'm ready
 to get this game rolling. This feels amazing. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... There it is. A full-blown idol that nobody knows about. There is a twist. -Uh-oh.
-You're gonna be randomly divided
into two groups of six. Two people are going home
tonight. -Oh.
-MARIA: Oh, wow. SODA:
Oh. Hunter's Nami, though. Q:
 If Tim wants to go
 against the six, well, buddy, you are going home, and you just don't know it. It could be
a blindside tonight... TEVIN:
It's not Nami versus Siga here. TEVIN:
 Tonight, I want
 to make a big move. Vote Soda. I want to be the curator of the
first blindside of the season. Which is why I'm so determined to at least
break one of them off. MARIA:
Venus is trying really hard, but she's pretty oblivious. Seventh person voted out
of Survivor 46: Tim. Can I give Tim a hug real quick? ♪ Brotherly love. ♪ The tribe has spoken. Eighth person voted out
and the first member of our jury: Soda. The tribe has spoken. Yeah, yeah. I mean, listen,
we'll get into it now. -Yeah, I want to.
-BEN: Yeah. -Before everybody
gets back, too.
TIFFANY: Yeah. I don't think you guys realize
there's, like, not much to hash out.
It's, like... Tim was my first friend,
so it was just, like, a bummer, -you know?
-Honestly, I know,
but still want to chat. Yeah, dawgs, let's go. I lost my good friend
 at Tribal Council. There was this
 unnamed bromance happening, the gruesome twosome twins--
 me and Tim. And it kept me feeling sane
during the game. It's funny to cry
over another dude. And, uh, I definitely think he was... He was my rock, you know? -TIFFANY:
What do I have to go on?
-BEN: Yeah. What do you have to offer me besides you being like,
"We're vibing"? TIFFANY:
Right, that's... They just want
to talk about bull ..., bro. KENZIE:
Also, we're all vibing. -I know.
-Like, everybody here
is fully down. Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap. -I know!
-I know!
-Yeah! Oh, my God. When we got back to camp
 from Tribal, I'm the type of guy
who needs to lock in, focus and move forward
 with the next plan. Tim was part of the six, but Tim was also playing
 a Tim's game. So moving forward in this game, I need to figure out if I want to bring in someone else. And with the other tribe
at Tribal now, hopefully voting out Venus, we have little time to
figure out valuable information. (Tiffany and Kenzie laugh) Q:
 It's not okay just
 to come to camp and keke, hee-hee and ya-ya
and not make real moves. -BEN: And I'm, like...
-For real? Q: I'm a game player
 and I'm a game changer and I'm going to change
the way this game is played. BEN:
Here we go. KENZIE:
Who we missing? -(indistinct chatter)
-What? KENZIE: So we're all expecting
Venus to be gone, and then guess who waltzes
her beautiful self in? TIFFANY:
Oh, my God. KENZIE: Venus' name has been
 brought up multiple times. No one really enjoys working
with her, no one trusts her. -You want to get into it?
-TIFFANY: Yes. Absolutely. KENZIE:
Yeah, let's hear it. Yeah. Tiff and I make eyes
 at each other like, "They didn't do it.
They didn't get her." -You want to hear the tea.
-KENZIE: Yeah. Well, surprise, surprise.
Two votes against Venus. -Q: Two votes against Venus.
-TIFFANY: Who voted for you? Tevin and Soda. -KENZIE: Oh.
-Q: Ooh.
-TIFFANY: Ooh. ...let's just say a man
who claims his entire identity in this game
is surrounded by honesty and being an honest person straight-up lied to my face
the entire day and wrote my name down. And I saw through that and, you know, karma
bit them in the ass. It was four against Soda,
and she went home. -Mm-hmm.
-Q: Damn.
-TIFFANY: I feel bad. No, Soda took it real well.
She gave me a big hug. She was like, "You got me."
I was like, "Yeah, I did." Then we're like... (laughs) I'm so sorry. (laughs) Venus has taken the accolades, trying to commandeer the fact that Soda's going home
 was her doing. TIFFANY:
Spicy legs. It was just like... -(indistinct chatter) -TIFFANY:
Yeah, we were just, like... TEVIN:
 I voted for Venus
 because I didn't know if Soda had an idol, I didn't
 know if Venus had an idol, and so that I could say, "Soda, I didn't vote for you. "I told you I'd never write
your name down in the game, and I didn't.
I wrote Venus'." But I don't need credit. I'll explain my game
 when I get to the final three. So right now,
 I'm letting Venus be cocky because, Venus, you may not
 understand right now, but you will very soon when your torch is snuffed
and you're going home. Ugh! Look, I thought
I was a cocky bitch. She was a poison copperhead. Well, she thinks
it was her idea. -She thinks the idea
was her plan...
-And I told you, my first opportunity,
I was writing Soda. That wasn't, like,
an original idea. But it worked,
which is what I wanted. -It did.
-Went to Maria and Charlie and they voted with us,
so that's good. LIZ:
 Oh, my gosh. Venus thinks she's a genius. Oh, wow.
 Tevin made a big move. Ever since I met all of you, I've been saying,
"Hey, Soda, Soda, Soda." And honestly,
 they're taking all the credit. And for someone like me,
 who has a giant ego, it is so hard for me to give them both the play. Well, I'll let it lie
till we get her out. Right. LIZ:
 I don't want to get lost in the shuffle of things. So, I have to stop hesitating and I have
 to start taking action or the action
is gonna be taken on me. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (laughing) You were a lot more quiet
when you were hungry. I was hungry as hell, man,
I was saying nothing. I got some ideas
flowing in this head of mine... -And look.
-(Kenzie laughs) So the Q Skirt is essentially a hoodie flipped backwards like a pouch of a kangaroo with two pockets.
 It's gonna be the next big thing. I even said, for a man, if you don't want
to wear no drawers, you just want to wear these,
you good. For a woman,
you don't want to carry a purse when you go to the amusement
parks or a fanny pack, you don't want that anymore, -you want a little more swag...
-Mm. ...get the Q Skirt. -Mm! Come on.
-If you just want fashion, want to rip the runway
in something different, -and want to turn it
to the side...
-Uh-huh. get the Q Skirt. -Oh, come on, now!
-And it's coming
in multiple colors. This Q Skirt here will cost less
than a fanny pack, an extra bag,
a sweater, a blanket. -TEVIN: All together,
-All together. -Oh, dear.
-It's a one-in-one,
and it's one for you. -Buy three, get one free.
-HUNTER: Oh, goodness. TEVIN:
 I don't think it's worth a damn, but I think just because of his conviction,
I want one. I'm convinced.
I want a Q Skirt. There we go. I'm definitely doing a Q Skirt
when I get home. -If you a guy...
-Yup. you just want a little swag, but you don't want
to carry a bag, -you get the Q Skirt.
-CHARLIE: Yup. -Why?
-Will you buy a Q Skirt?
Yes or no? -Sign me up.
-(laughing) CHARLIE:
 Q is just a really funny guy and someone
 who I am doing my best to stay on his good side because I've learned now that Q isn't just driving votes. He's putting together alliances and groups of people he wants
at the very end of the game. So, this morning, I have perhaps my most important conversation
 of the game. Man, I tell you, if you ever are playing Survivor, get up at sunrise. Every single major conversation I've had in this game
has happened at the sunrise, when everyone's asleep
 in the shelter. That's where the moves are made. Yeah. -I'm freaking itching.
-Well, Charlie... I'm itching
to play the game, man. -Let's friggin' do it.
-Let's do it then, man. Let's go. Let's go. And as we're talking,
 I realize, this is an interview
 for an alliance. So I'm thinking, I want to get hired
for this position. You know, I want the job. Maria is going
to approach you... Mm-hmm. ...about joining
a bigger alliance. -Yeah.
-This is the first step of me saying, -"Charlie, I want
to work with you."
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-We're trying to get a six. Okay. This is the first time
 that I'm hearing of the six. I knew Q had some master plans, but I was never in, you know, the C suite. I told you, I got
your best interest at heart. Yeah. So I've been, uh, trying
to plant the seed for you to join this alliance
for a long time. -I told you, man. I told you.
-Maria. You got my back. CHARLIE:
 So this mystical, powerful six
that Q has thrown together is made up of two Nami--
 Tevin and Hunter, two Yanu-- Q and Tiffany, two Siga-- Maria and myself, the newest recruit. We got to talk, though, 'cause, like,
this game is getting crazy. I love the six,
but the six isn't impenetrable. The six is probably
the... shakiest six -that's ever existed,
because guess what?
-Mm-hmm. Tim was in the six. Maria seems pretty gung ho
 on the six. She sees it as a guaranteed way to get to the final six, and I see it as a way
that I might get stuck with a bunch of people
I can't beat at the end. Only thing
we got to be careful of and watch
is Charlie getting smart and trying to make a move. -Mm-hmm.
-Look, I just don't think Charlie has it to try to turn. -You know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm. -He don't have
that killer instinct.
-No. CHARLIE:
We're not the first group of six in Survivor history to say, "Let's get to the final six
together, then duke it out." Something always goes awry. And I have to decide am I what goes awry? (M an ) Ex cu se m e, would you mind taking a picture

We can play hide-and-seek. Hide-and-seek
would be so fun right now. TIFFANY: Q decides that he wants to play hide-and-seek,
which is no surprise, because Q has been trying
 to play hide-and-seek since we were at Yanu camp. We got enough people now,
and we all full. Oh, my God. Fine. -Y'all want to play?
-BEN: I'm in. -We better play hide-and-seek.
-Q: Hell, yeah.
-Yeah. TIFFANY:
 And I think
 it's hilarious, because here we are,
these grown-ass adults competing with each other
 for a million dollars. And we're like, "Let's play
hide-and-seek, y'all." Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a tiger by his toe. My mama told me to... I really am a kid. I really
enjoy playing hide-and-seek. But I'm gonna use this
 as part of my gameplay. But everyone else,
it's just fun. Ma. Yeah. -I'm it?
-You're it. I'm not playing around.
I'm gonna find you all. Q, I'm coming for you. Q:
I don't think anyone thinks that this was a gameplay move more than "Q wanted to have fun and be Q" move. I'm at the boat!
I'm counting to 40! -Okay, let's go.
-Okay. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ Q:
 What this game
 is gonna represent for me is who can hide in plain sight the best. CHARLIE:
...thirty, 31, 32, thirty-three. Survivor is a tense game, and it's nice to just loosen up. You know, sometimes
you just got to forget the strategy
 and play a silly little game. ...thirty-eight, 39. 40! Ready or not, here I come! -I did not see you at first.
-I know. I... CHARLIE:
Wow. People are not half-assing
 this hide-and-seek game. They are diving
 in the tall grass, covering themselves
 with palm fronds, going deeper into the jungle than anyone has ever gone
in this game. (sing-songy):
Venus! -LIZ: No. No.
-CHARLIE: Two down. Two down. How did you see me? CHARLIE:
I saw your hood.
That was good, though. This group of ten
is competitive as hell. Whitney Houston. Oh, my gosh. VENUS:
Honestly, Tevin,
I did not see you. -Yeah.
-I almost walked right by you. -(laughing)
-CHARLIE: That's intense. TEVIN (loudly):
Ah! VENUS: Even though it's, like,
 a silly, stupid game of hide-and-seek, and it's meant to be, like, fun and bonding,
 it still reveals a lot about people's
personality traits and their underlying talents. Tiffany in the grass! -TEVIN: Oh!
-CHARLIE: Let's go. VENUS:
 Tiffany-- the fact
 that she hid with a red Buff on her head-
 that just tells me that she's a little sloppy
and may not know to hide those little details. -CHARLIE: Dang, bro.
-TEVIN: Oh, Q over there. -No way. You got Q?
-Where? I'm so proud of myself.
I found someone. CHARLIE:
Good for you. Q:
 It was only Liz who actually walked
 in the woods to see me. Bad idea, Liz. 'Cause now I know that you are playing the game,
 you are paying attention, and you do want to win,
as much as you say, "It's just a million dollars." Oh, Kenzie! No! You got me. -Oh, my God.
-You guys were like... Q:
 Next, we find Kenzie, someone in this game
 that I know to be a camouflage, blend in, likable person, which shows
 she can go undetected. This was a good idea, Q.
My heart was racing. (sing-songy):
Maria? -Maria's definitely in the well.
-Maria?! TEVIN: (sing-songy):
Maria. (sing-songy): Come out,
come out, wherever you are. TEVIN:
We just want to talk to you. -That's your... Maria.
-KENZIE: Maria! This one here! (chuckles) I got some camouflage. VENUS: Maria-- super creative.
 Like, she put a little headdress on
 for herself, she blended in. That says to me that
she's someone who works well with her surroundings
and is really adaptable. -If you had a sniper,
we'd be gone.
-(laughs) We need
to step our game up here. We have 60 seconds. A mad dash,
or else Hunter and Ben win, and that would suck. TEVIN:
Split up. 60 seconds. -Hunter's somewhere stupid.
-LIZ: I don't know. I already know
we're not gonna find him. If I was Hunter, I would
definitely get up in the tree. Q:
30 seconds, and they're both safe
and they win the game. ♪ ♪ Q:
Five, four, three, two, one. Game over! Hunter and Ben win. Where are they? BEN:
Let's go! -Oh. Damn!
-Where are you?
-Where are you? Wait. Ben's over here. CHARLIE:
Oh, my God.
I can only hear him. -Oh, I see him.
-Damn, Ben! -BEN: Let's go!
-KENZIE: Good job! Ben was not found at all in hide-and-seek, which means this guy is capable
of playing an undercover game, but be very powerful at the end. (whoops) Ben made a mistake. Hunter, you win! -We're done looking!
-TEVIN: That was fun. -KENZIE: That was really fun.
-BEN: Come on, dude. KENZIE:
Good idea. That was fun. -That was so much fun.
-BEN: Nice going. Hunter's right here! -TEVIN: Oh, my God.
-(overlapping chatter) VENUS:
I said he's in a tree. I got Q. -LIZ: Hunter, you win.
-BEN: That's ridiculous. Q:
 Hunter made a mistake. If I can't find you
in hide-and-seek, I can't find you in this game. If you will risk going that high in a tree
 for hide-and-seek, you would take a risk and take a shot at me
if you could. Not happening, boss. Honestly, that was
the perfect ending to this game. -That was sick.

for us to have, like, a little debrief chat
of what happened last night. ...I feel like feelings ran hot
on both sides. -My feelings weren't hot.
-You were sad. Yeah. -And I think...
-Thank you for respecting it. Yeah. Yeah. VENUS:
 I was a little uncertain how that Soda vote
would be read, because in my mind,
 it really was my vote. I put in the groundwork to get
 all the necessary votes in to lock that down
 and make it solid, and now, I'm kind of the first person
to pull off a blindside. -You want to know
how I pulled it off?
-Yeah. I never even wanted
to write Soda's name down. I had a conversation
first thing that morning where she'd said that she's not
gonna work for me long-term, and I knew
she was gonna come for me, so, I... I pulled the numbers
as soon as I could. -Damn, that's good.
-I know. And that's... -My God, today.
-My God, today. (laughs) And in terms
 of damage control with Tevin, I found it
 to be very important for me to air out some of our laundry and to actually open up a line
of communication with Tevin. Can I ask you, now that
we've gotten it out of the way? Like, I don't think
I've heard you talk, like, strategy-wise,
like, what you see for the next phase of the game. -I'm moment to moment.
-You're moment to moment. Yes, I understand that,
but, also, like, Soda was the same way,
and I guess in this game, like, just, like, for advice,
is that you need to sometimes show a little bit
of, like... commitment in a direction. But I think, for at least
this next short while, -we would benefit each other
by being more open.
-Mm-hmm. VENUS:
 Tevin's kind of like
 a fish out of water in terms of the strategy portion
of this game. Like, sure,
 he's a social butterfly, but I don't think
he really knows what's going on. Like, he seemed very impressed
 that I was able to pull that move on him,
 but to me, it was like, "How could you not see it coming
in the first place, Tevin? Like, come on." (high-pitched laugh) LIZ:
Oh, whoa. That's a new laugh. (Tevin laughs deeply) She thinks, honest to God, she has pulled off the move that I planned for her. LIZ:
 These two are running around. Venus: "It's my idea."
Tevin: "Actually, it was mine. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha." (deep, loud laughing) Shut up. (laughs)
I'm about to pee. LIZ:
 I love Tevin, but I know now people are seeing him
as the mastermind? She said to me, "Thank you
for respecting my move." LIZ:
 He navigated the Soda vote without Soda even knowing. So now, I need to give a signal to the other Tribemates that I'm here to play, too. I love this game. LIZ:
 I'm sorry, Tevin, but you got to go. I know everybody's playing Survivor hard-core right now, but, like,
sometimes you got to, like, pause the game for,
like, three minutes. And hear me out. What has she actually done to make you feel
threatened by her besides mentioning your name
to people -that aren't even
taking her seriously?
-Right. -Who cares?
-Right. -Let her stick around.
That's just another body.
-Right. TIFFANY:
 Venus thinks
 she's a power player, but she's really not.
 I wanted her out bad, but I think I'd rather deal
 with a nuisance than a threat. So I'm trying to shift
my focus now because... the point in the game where you're just getting out
obvious targets is done. That's the thing.
I don't know who's next. -That's right.
-That's the only thing. You got to wait and see how the
immunity challenge shakes out and see what the options are. TEVIN:
 Tiffany is in my alliance. However, Tiffany's
 getting shaky. She wants to keep Venus around. So, Tiffany is not lining up
with what the six wants, and what the six wants is
six to stay strong. Tiffany says
Venus ain't a threat. I know what you're saying. I said, "Tiffany,
who you want to go instead of Venus then, if you
don't want to get Venus out?" She said, "Well, let's just
see what happens "in the immunity challenge
and let's just see who's left and figure it out from there." Q:
Mm-hmm. Up until this point,
 Tiff has been my number one ally in this game. But Tiff is trying
 to keep members in this game that are not part of the six,
 like Venus, because she's playing the old Survivor-- take a goat to the end. That's not the game
that I want to play. In this game,
 you have to play a Q game. If you don't play my game
 and you want to go off and do your own thing,
 then you're probably not going to last in this game
 a lot longer. And if we feel like Tiff's not
gonna play get in the six, then maybe Tiff's gonna lose,
be sent home. I'm fine with that. Mm-hmm. Q:
 So, I need to confirm that our games are going in two
different directions, and if so, then Tiff might be the next vote
 if she doesn't win. For me, if I had to...
if I had to throw out names for who I want to go next,
it would either be Maria, Ben. Ben is sneaky,
but he's not as smart as Maria. And it just comes down
to that for me. Q:
Tiff has made multiple mistakes. She's trying to keep goats. And now Tiff brought up
 Maria's name. She's in the six, Tiff.
Big mistake. Right now, the six is just permission for Q to fire. If you bring up a name
 within the six, now you've given me ammunition
 to take you out without any recourse. -From Tiff?
-Yeah. She's making me super nervous. And-and she-she's really
about keeping Venus. Yeah. Tiff said my name,
 and so, if someone in our alliance is putting up
someone else's name in the alliance,
they've got to go. -which is?
-You can't repeat this. Tiff has an idol. MARIA:
Q told me that Tiff has an idol. I am actually really surprised
 that Q would tell me, that that makes me trust Q even more. So who's our target? So, let's go for Tiff. Got it. MARIA:
 Q's game is all about trust. He does not want
to feel anybody wavering at all. And so, if you show him
that you're trustworthy, he's gonna work with you. The minute you start
 looking shady, you're out. And so, we may have an alliance of five instead of
an alliance of six. Yes. Right now, this is
 the biggest move yet for me, to now turn on my number one
 ally in the game. -Mm-hmm.
-TEVIN: Mm-hmm. Q:
The ideal is to keep my alliance making decisions
 that I want them to make, under my control, under my rule. It's almost like I'm a mob boss. And they dare not to say a name
within my organization. And if they do,
send 'em packing. I send 'em a Q Skirt, though. EG O, T HE N UM BE R ON E RA TE D BR AN D IN C OR DL ES S OU TD OO R PO WE R BR IN GS Y OU T HE SE LE CT C UT M OW ER .

-All right. KENZIE:
Thanks, Jeff. Thank you, Maria. All right, once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
it is a Survivor classic and one I never
get tired of seeing. You're gonna hold onto a pole... for as long as you can. -(laughing)
-When you drop... ...you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed -a spot in the final nine.
-Wow. Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be the ninth person
voted out and become the second member
of our jury. Little something else
to deal with today. -I knew it. I knew it.
-How fun. PROBST:
In this new era of Survivor, you start with very little,
including no food. And then at a certain point in
the game, you're given a chance to earn some food. That day is today. -TIFFANY: Oh, my God.
-(whooping) -That's a heavy bag.
-Oh, yes. PROBST:
Enough rice to last you
to the end of the season. -Wow.
-TEVIN: Oh, wow. Here's what it will cost you. Four players... have to agree
to sit out of this challenge, give up your shot at immunity in exchange for the rice. -And four is the max?
-Minimum. -The minimum?
The minimum, right?
-PROBST: Four is it. MARIA: Are you willing
to negotiate, Jeff? -We can't do three?
-No. Four is the set number. No negotiating, Jeff? PROBST:
I'll give you an option. Four of you can agree
to sit out, or two of you can agree... to give up your vote
at tonight's Tribal Council and still compete and still have a shot
at immunity. I'm gonna say, "Hell, no."
(laughs) Well, it really comes down
to the same thing. Where does everybody feel
they sit in the game? How comfortable are you
with your alliance? PROBST: Talk about it. Is anyone thinking immediately, -"I'm sitting out for this?"
-No one want to sit out? -Nope.
-No. Wow. Nobody. So before we even go further, Charlie, what does that say
about where Survivor 46 is? Everyone out here
is a competitor. We played hide-and-seek -for nothing.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
Not for immunity, not for any advantage,
and people were diving into tall grass. You know, Hunter climbed
20 feet up in a tree. You know, these people are here
to compete. And when you give us this, which is one
of the Survivor classics, -nobody wants to sit out.
-Yeah. I'll be one. PROBST:
Okay. -I haven't eaten.
-Okay, so we've got two. Liz says "I'll sit out."
Q is volunteering to sit out. We just need two more and this rice is yours. If we give you
an immediate third, -would you give us the rice?
-No. It's four.
Four is not even half. That's fair in this game.
Venus, you're shaking your head "no,"
which I understand. Explain why. VENUS:
Only one person
will win this challenge, and I have a very good feeling
that that person could be me, so I don't want to step out. Is there anyone who'd step out,
like, in a pair, two at once? -They just don't...
-Are you willing to step out? If there's someone who's willing
to jump out with me, -I'd consider it.
-I mean, stepping out now
don't commit us to doing it.
If you step out, and no one else is doing it,
he counts down, and we just all do it, you know,
so if you want to step out, -step out.
-LIZ: Right, and then,
we still play. I don't know.
I want to play it, though. Let's make it interesting.
You keep talking. I'll just quietly count. Ten. -Oh, wow.
-Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. -Five.
-I don't think
anyone wants to step out. Four. Three. Two. One. We don't have a deal. First time in the new era
we could not come to a deal. Liz, you can step back. Y'all, I'm fitting to win this. -Yeah. You deserve it.
-PROBST: It tells me everybody here is playing, this game is fully cooked. -LIZ: Wow.
-PROBST: That's all
you ever want in a season. We'll draw for your spots,
we'll get started. Well, it's been one of

That was a bad decision, man. Now we have to go out

 It is time to send Tiff to the jury because she broke my rule. If you target
 anybody within the six, you go home. We talked about it
a little bit earlier. You still want the same plan or
you want to do something else? We already knew what was up. We already said,
"Hey, if Tiffany doesn't win immunity today, she's gone." She's messing
 with the six alliance. Therefore, she got to go. Okay. We got three right now.
I know... TEVIN:
Maria would go for it.
Charlie would go for it. You think Liz would go for that? -Yeah.
-That's all we need. TEVIN:
 In addition to the plus-one
 alliance, I believe that Liz would vote with us, as she has
 in the past Tribal Councils. So, if this plan goes down, Tiffany will be blindsided
tonight. How's it going over here? All I know is I'm thinking... "Liz... "...do you just want
to stay in the game... -Or do you want
to play the game?
-Right. Do you want to -play the game? Yeah.

to, like, play -and have a ... shot?"

I'm just gonna say it.
-BEN: Say it. If this gets out, like,
I'm gone tonight. -MARIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. I want Tevin gone. I love Tevin.
We've been number ones, but he made
a really big move with Soda. Do you think that he's the most
logical threat right now? LIZ:
Yes. I, personally,
I would like Tevin out. I want to blindside Tevin. I've realized who Liz is,
and Liz is a fighter. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Let me just be real with you. I'm looking back at the last
 15 days, laughing at myself at how many times
 I let someone else take the lead, and... I'm done with that. It's got to be Tevin tonight. -Okay. -Thank God. Finally, people have
come to their senses and have realized
how big of a threat Tevin is. From what I'm hearing... Okay. And I think if we all,
maybe, work together -and try to get Tevin...
-Okay. we could probably
form a comfortable, maybe, chill alliance
for a vote or two. -Okay. -Tevin's got the social charisma like I've never seen. He's so likable.
 In real life, amazing. In a game where we're
competing for a million dollars, got to go. Game time, brother. Also, the Yanu three has been driving
so many votes in this game, and right now, I don't want to be leading all of the votes
to put a bigger target on Yanu. -Liz... Liz wants...
-We got to vote for Tevin. -Liz is on board.
-Ben just told me
the same thing. -Okay, good. We're voting Tevin.
-... yes. But if it gets back to Tevin, -it's gonna be...
That's how easy.
-And that's why... and as... But, also, he has an extra vote, so he could flip that
on any of us. KENZIE:
Yeah. TIFFANY:
 Tevin is a huge threat. Also, Tevin has
 an extra vote in his pocket. And the deeper we get
into the game, the more power that extra vote
is gonna have. What's up with you? But right now, Q and I have
 a great working relationship. We share information freely. I absolutely
 cannot leave him out of a vote at this point in time. Everybody who I spoke
to today is saying Tevin. -Everybody.
-Who? Liz the one who brought
Tevin name up to me. And she said that she spoke
to Charlie, Ben and Maria, and they was with it. She was like, "Listen..." Well, I'm gonna
tell you right now, if you don't vote Tevin,
people gonna be looking at you next.
You better get on board. Q:
 The idea of a plan being changed last-minute doesn't really sit well with me. Tiff was telling me
about the plan. -Yeah.
-Is that real coming from you, -or is that just talk?
-Yes. You talking about T? -Yeah. Yeah.
-That's real? I feel like just about
everybody's on board. Q:
 I'm not the driver
 in the Tevin vote. And my game is based off
 me being in control. So I wanted
 to gain control again. Everybody you think is working with us have flipped. Tevin is the one
that's going home tonight. -They're voting for Tevin?
-All of 'em. -Every single person
in this camp.
-Okay. We can't stop it. So there's no need
to even bring it up, -because then they gonna
know I said something.
-Uh-huh. -You see what I'm saying?
-Mm-hmm. I ain't trying to ... my game
over trying to save one person. -Mm-hmm.
-But I know
if we write Tiff name down, -she's gonna be here tomorrow.
She's not going home.
-Okay. Hunter... HUNTER:
 Q says it's actually Tevin, and we don't
 have the numbers anymore, but it just seems
so off the wall for me. Tevin's good
 for all of our games, and we made an alliance
 based off of Andy Griffith. (whistling a tune) HUNTER:
 I want to keep Tevin here. And so it's like, I've got to go and do this damage control and get ahead
of what's going on, so it doesn't just
completely destroy my game. Q:
 Hunter walks right past me
 to go to talk to other people. And I'm like,
 "Oh, man, this guy, he's doing exactly what
I did not want him to do," especially moments before going to Tribal. Venus, can we
talk to them real fast? Can we chat
with them real quick? -Oh, without me there?
-Yes. Q:
 I made a mistake,
 and now this plan is all screwed up. I should have
kept my mouth shut. The reason we targeted
Tiff is because she, like, went after Maria. Tevin never did that. I guess the decision is,
are we fine with Tevin leaving right now? He trusts us so much
that the guy's just sitting back there
thinking it's all fine. (whistling) -Y'all... I mean...
-CHARLIE: No, no, I-I hear you. I hear you. I'm thinking. Anticipating chaos. VENUS:
For the first time in my life. I've never seen that man
run to someone and talk trash. Oh, he just...
Now he's gesturing over here.
 Now he's gesturing -over here again.
-KENZIE: So, we still have the numbers, right? -Yeah.
-Definitely. VENUS:
 The plan is Tevin. There's peace in the castle.
The kingdom is calm. But now all I see is
this conversation on the beach, and my radar is going off. Something's afoot. All right, bro. There are no rules.
I can go sit there. Hi. What's up? LIZ:
Venus, I love you. I'm really sorry.
I have to talk to them. I know that's gonna
piss you off. I'm sorry,
but y'all also realize the sun is setting,
and we all have talks. So, like, can y'all wrap it up
in the next few minutes? -Yes.
-Sure.
-Thank you. CHARLIE:
Yes. (laughs) Charlie, I want to know
what you think. -You seem really upset.
-CHARLIE: I'm not upset. No. I'm just feeling, like,
all the whiplash of today. -It's, like...
-So then you guys
want to go back to Tiff? Like, is that
what you would prefer, or... -Listen, I'll do whatever
y'all want, at this point.
-Yeah. I know, but we got
to come together as a whole. I would rather keep
the original and go Tiff. LIZ:
Y'all do whatever you want.
I'm voting Tevin. CHARLIE:
 I have no freaking clue what's gonna happen because of this chaos
that's been whipped up at the 11th hour. -So, so...
-I don't know what the heck's... CHARLIE:
 Half of the tribe
 wants to get out Tiff. The other half wants
 to get Tevin out of the game. And, at this point,
 Maria and I are at another crossroads. In my eyes, Tevin
is the better option than Tiff. Tevin orchestrated
 the Soda blindside, but this threadbare alliance of six is thinking
 about voting out Tiff because Tiff threw out
 the name Maria. And, ultimately,
 Maria's my number one. This alliance has zero legs.
 It's going nowhere. It's the loosest use of the word
 "alliance" that has ever existed,
 but, once again, Maria and I have to commit and we have to make a decision. [ Ce ll ph on e ri ng in g ] Ph on e ca ll f ro m th e bo ss ? So rr y. Outdoor time is me time. Sticking it to the boss,

I guess we got to start with the rice negotiation. It's 16 days
with very little food. Q, you tried. You were the first to say,
"I'll volunteer." Wisely so, 'cause you were
first out of the challenge. Has there been
any discussion about that? I had a bit of a temper tantrum
back at camp, after. I was still upset and mad. I mean, I think five people
were out within two minutes, and there was only gonna be one
winner and one loser tonight. So everyone suffered
when I think the odds were in their favor to feed
everybody for another nine days. Liz, another thing
that is very difficult to try to understand
until you're here is what hunger after 16 days
feels like. Are you surprised that the group couldn't make a deal? I was surprised that Q sat out. I thought I was gonna
be the only one to step up because I can't eat coconut,
I can't eat papaya. Even some of the rewards I have barely been able to eat. I haven't even
gone to the restroom yet. Oh. PROBST:
Tiff, is the rice negotiation just an indicator
of where this game is? TIFFANY:
Oh, absolutely. Nobody feels safe enough
to step out. Everybody feels like they need
to compete for immunity, and that was blatantly obvious. They said food is not
as important as safety. But, Jeff, I want to stop before we get deep into the Tribal. The only person that's
going home tonight is me. And I'll tell you why. Wait, wait, w... You mean
you're predicting your vote out? Yeah. Well,
I don't think anyone here coming into the Tribal Council
was voting for me, but I'm gonna ask
everybody to vote for me. Then all of these nine folks
are going back to camp today. I feel like... -Let me
just interrupt real quick.
-Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. -(groans)
-PROBST: Is this news
to everyone? -Yeah. What is going on?
-What the hell?
-Totally. Q, what are you talking about? So if someone goes home tonight, and it wasn't the right way,
because, like I say, there's probably
five people here right now who are like,
"Who the heck am I voting for?" because of mistakes
that I made in the game. And I want everybody to start
just playing the game hard. You have a new beginning. -Kenzie, it's clear
what he's saying, right?
-Yeah. To everyone. He is saying,
"Vote me out." Is that clear to everyone? -It's clear, but, like, what?
-Yeah, it's clear,
but it doesn't... -TIFFANY: But it
doesn't make sense.
-But I don't understand why. TEVIN:
The math isn't math-ing,
because I've talked to Q, and I know that Q is here
and he wants to play the game. And I guess it's just
kind of out of the blue, and it's just very unexpected. It's not something
that was even hinted towards. -I mean, it is
completely off-brand.
-KENZIE: Yeah. And yet, Ben, we just talked
about how competitive. It's so competitive, you wouldn't give up
your shot at immunity for rice. And here's somebody saying,
"Guess what? Merry Christmas." You know, Q and I did not
get off to a great start, but everybody knows
he's been playing hard and in a genuine way. So it's like this... th... Even me, who's been, like, kind of skirting around him, is like, "Uh, what?" This is actually,
like, probably the most bonkers thing
I would have expected tonight. (whispering indistinctly) PROBST:
Tiff. I'm very confused, Jeff. I don't know where
this is coming from because I've known Q since I got here,
and Q's a competitor. So this is completely, like,
coming out of left field for me. It's-it's not me giving up.
Trust me. I want to play, and I've been
playing since day one. But again, when something don't sit right with me and I feel partially
responsible for it, I got to own up to it and say,
"You know what? I'm not gonna steal
someone else's joy and dream," especially in this game, where
you only get an opportunity to potentially play once. -And...
-I think you can own up to it, person to person,
without leaving the game. -And I don't think
anyone wants you to go.
-(overlapping agreement) -Yeah.
-And I-I know y'all don't, but someone is going
to get voted out because of last-minute
things that happened, and I feel partially
responsible for it. And I'm big enough
to say that I want you guys to go on and play.
I'm serious about this, now. I want y'all to go on and play, but start playing the game. 'Cause everybody
have a new opportunity. PROBST:
So, Kenzie, on one side, Q's volunteering, which means
nobody else here is going home. On the other side, Q is a vote,
and he's probably in an alliance with one or two or three
or who knows how many people. So that also
will impact the game. KENZIE:
Yeah. Q's saying,
"Go ahead. Fresh start." What if you were a part
of my plans five plans from now? That's not a fresh start for me. That's undoing the plans
that I've been building. Like, it's gonna be
wacky no matter what. Like, it's not, like,
we're gonna go back to camp and be like,
"Well, Q's gone. No worries." -Like, "We're all kumbaya."
-Because all we gonna do is go
back with a bunch of questions. -We know exactly
who you were talking to last.
-But we can't get answers... Jeff, but at the same time,
Q is a grown man, and this is a game
for not one dollar, not $1,000, but one million. And if someone wants to
walk out of the game willingly, then I am not going to
coddle them to say, "Stay." (whispering indistinctly) -Can we talk?
Can we talk for a minute?
-LIZ: Can we talk? Yeah. It's your Tribal. Oh, boy. (whispering indistinctly) I guess we're
at a live Tribal, Jeff. I don't know. It's like, "Dude, what is up?" TIFFANY:
I don't understand why... MARIA: Okay? This does not rock. (short chuckle) Kenzie, come here. My... ♪ ♪ Wow. I don't know who. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Okay. Never seen anything like this. All right. In one of the craziest
Tribals ever, it is time to vote. Q, you're up. ♪ ♪ That was the dumbest thing ever. Dumbest Tribal ever. Oh, my God. At this point,
I don't know if this is the real plan, the fake plan. This is what I was told. And we want
to flush the extra vote tonight. Whatever. I'm as confused as hell. I don't know
what the hell going, Q, but clearly you been out
 of Mississippi too damn long, 'cause your brain is gone. But we can talk about that
when we get back to camp. I'm gonna put this down. Give me some good luck. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Venus. Tevin. Venus. Two votes Venus, one vote Tevin. Tevin.
We're tied. Two votes Venus,
two votes Tevin. Tevin. That's three votes Tevin,
two votes Venus. Tevin. That's four votes Tevin,
two votes Venus. Tevin. That's five votes Kevin,
two votes Venus. Ninth person voted out and the second member
of our jury: Tevin.
That's six. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. CHARLIE:
That was so shocking. -Y'all can go
eat worms and slugs.
-(all chuckling) -CHARLIE: Tevin, we love you.
-TIFFANY: Love you. -Love you, Tevin.
-LIZ: Love you, Tevin. -BEN: Tevin, you rock.
-Y'all say that now. Oh, this is so exciting, Jeff. (laughs) Okay. I'm sorry. -Tevin...
-Yeah? the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Good job, brother.
-Good luck, y'all. Tevin, you rock. This doesn't rock. ♪ Oh, yes. ♪ Grab your torches.

 These bumbling buffoons. These two dum-dum meatheads. I'm-a give 'em hell.

 I think Danny is our secret weapon. KEOGHAN:
 Firefighter moms Sunny and Bizzy

Where are we going? -I'm heading... Okay.

you are first place. Congratulations. Meanwhile, frustration
