-There we go, there we go.
-Ah! -(cheering)
-Fire, baby! Aah! PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... VENUS:
 All of a sudden,
 I have a rock-solid alliance. I'm feel pumped. KENZIE:
 I woke up this morning
 with an idea that we could make a fake idol and make Jess think
 she has a real idol. I'm trying to help. I have Jess on one side. I have Kenzie on the other side. So I know one of the two that I want to go home will exit tonight. Bhanu, you appear
to be very forthcoming about who you're tight with.
So, how about Jess? Playing this for yourself? Yeah.
Going to play it for myself. -For yourself? Okay.
-Yeah. This is... not a hidden immunity idol. (both laughing) Second person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jess. Oh, man. The tribe has spoken. -Q: That was a fun Tribal.
 -TIFFANY: Yeah. -KENZIE: It was lively.
-TIFFANY: It sure was. BHANU:
I felt so naive. -I really did.
-TIFFANY: Why? BHANU:
Where did she get the idol from? We just snipped it off
of D.J.'s water bottle. When we got back to camp, I feel like we had a little bit
of explaining to do. Bhanu didn't know anything
 about the fake idol, and we had to frame it so that, like,
it was all in his best interest. We didn't want to tell you
until we got back to camp because we didn't want you
to accidentally blurt it out. Q:
You got to think about it now. Let's say if that idol was real. She wrote your name down, so... She wrote my name down? -Yes.
-Q: Yeah. BHANU: She said that everyone's
writing my name down? Q:
No, she wrote your name down. KENZIE:
We all voted Jess. -We all voted for Jess.
-Q: We all voted Jess. And she voted for you. That's why
we gave her that fake idol. KENZIE:
So that she wouldn't play
her Shot in the Dark. Q:
So she wouldn't play
that Shot in the Dark. BHANU:
 I'm so glad that
 I'm still on the island. So... namaste to that. (laughs) But I could be the next person
 going home because Kenzie, Q and Tiffany
 are pulling all their master tricks. They played it in such a way that Jess plays
 the fake hidden humidity idol rather than
 the Shot in the Dark. And she writes a name,
and guess whose name she wrote. Jess said that I'm her best
friend, and she wrote my name. (laughs) Survivor it is. Q:
That's why
it's so critical at Tribal. We got to watch what we say
and when we say things. Mm-hmm. Q:
Tribal is not over until Jeff... KENZIE:
Reads the votes
and snuffs somebody's torch. Q:
Reads the vote
and snuff the torch. So just because
we're at Tribal don't mean now is the time
to air it out, you know? TIFFANY:
You can totally lie to Jeff. -It's okay.
-(Bhanu sighs)
-KENZIE: Or just, like, -not saying anything at all.
-TIFFANY: Or just... I was about to say,
"Or just keep quiet." -KENZIE: If you don't
want to lie,
-You can't lie, -just don't say nothing.
-don't say anything. BHANU:
 They're saying like,
 "Oh, you don't have to, "like, give honest answers
 to Jeff Probst. You can just give him
 any kind of crap." But I can't do that. They said that you should know when to-- what is it-- when to show, when to shot? Something like that.
I don't know what that proverb. Something... you know... Fold? Ah. You have to know when to... when to fold, when to hold. I'm not an actor. I can't do that. (sniffles)
Yeah. So that's where I'm at. (laughs) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (birdsong) KENZIE:
 We are probably going down
 in Survivor history as, like, one of the
roughest starts in the new era. We haven't won anything. We still don't have a fire. We're getting rained on,
the shelter has holes in it. We found
 this rock wall overhang. Here's a ton of dirt,
and we slept here. Like, that's where Yanu is at. I'm gonna walk back to camp
and get my water... -Are you okay?
-Yeah. -What's going on?
-Okay. -I didn't sleep, that's all.
-Yeah? Yeah. It was raining all night. I didn't sleep a wink. And I'm paranoid
because those three-- all three of them
 are in a tight alliance, and if we don't win the next immunity challenge,
 I'll be going home. They have so many tricks
 in their hats to pull. They're very good at this. All three are masterminds. One mind versus three. The only way to save myself is to find a hidden immunity
 idol so I can move forward. It's not here. Where can I find this idol? It can be under many
of these coconuts. I've been looking for the idol
 pretty much the whole time I've been on this island. So many coconuts. And I don't have any luck. I have to turn
all these coconuts upside down. I don't know. This is so frustrating. I want to play the game, and... I'm hitting a wall all the time. (groans) BHANU:
Can I have
a heart-to-heart with you? KENZIE:
What's wrong? I want to stay in this game, but it seems like, you know, my name is
on the chopping block next. And that's why I'm asking, like, if there is any way
that I can work with you. I mean, I'm open
to hearing plans, for sure. I-I don't have any, and I'm not
throwing any names out there. I'm just asking, like... Do you see how
that's kind of hard for me to work with, though? Bhanu is not playing, is what Banu is doing wrong. He doesn't have a strategic bone
in his sweet little body. I feel so alone. I don't know what to do.
(sniffles) I need some help, Kenzie. KENZIE:
 He loves the game,
 he loves to watch it, but it's different to play it. I think he just came out here
with a good attitude, which is appreciated,
definitely, but it's not a long-term thing
that's gonna get you far, especially now, in the new era. Like, we only have 26 days. People are dropping like flies
and right now, it's us. Loyalty is very important
in regular life and Survivor, but you also have to
come up with some plan for people to be able
to work with. BHANU:
 Always sweet Kenzie--
 how she portrays herself-- she's like this mermaid... dragon. Mermaid up until here, but she's hiding
 under the rocks. She's like a very beautiful,
 sweet, kind mermaid. But when
you look behind the rock, it's a big dragon tail. That's Kenzie. I said, like,
 "Hey, can I work with you?" And she's like,
 "Yeah, I can work with you, "but you have
 to tell me the plan. "So if you have a plan,
 then let me know and then we can work on it." Mermaid... dragon. Remember that. I don't know where
my-my position is in the tribe. Here's the deal. I want
to keep you around because I know for a fact that you're a loyal person
and a loyal vote. I would rather have somebody
that's loyal that I can coach you up
to say, at Tribal Council, "This is what you say." You've looked at past seasons, look at Boston Rob's season. He had a Phillip.
You're my Phillip. I know you're gonna
be a loyal soldier. You're gonna be there.
You're not gonna flip-flop. You can listen to information, but you're not gonna flip on me. That's what I want to take, bub. I knew Bhanu
 was having a hard time, but what I don't want him
to do is get so wrapped up in his mind
that we're against him and he gives up. So I had to reassure Bhanu
 that we're in this together, and if push comes to shove, we just have to make sure
that we're on the same page. It is going to be
an uphill battle to get our foot
back into this game. But if you can
connect with folks like how you were
at camp with us, you have a great shot
at winning. -You see what I'm saying?
-But I cannot win. -Anybody can win.
-I'm a wackadoodle -and, like...
-Wackadoodles win. Get the confidence within. You can win,
just like I can win. So, cheer up. We're good. -Thank you, Coach.
-Yes, sir. BHANU:
That's a really,
really good talk. However, what if the girls
came up with that idea? Because even last night, the girls came up with
 the fake immunity idol thing. So what they're trying
to do is... I don't have to play my Shot in the Dark so they can...
they can vote me off. That's what they wanted to do. Or maybe Q is really... He like... he likes me. I don't know. How will I know? That's how smart

 We're going on a field trip. Going to find some idols. CHARLIE:
Oh, idol, where are you? Where do you live? MORIAH:
 This morning, we all agree to go on an idol hunt together. Aah! The thing
 with a group idol hunt is you're half hunting for idols and you're half hunting
for pocket clumps. You got one eye on the ground and you got one eye on
the person next to you looking. -Did you find it?
-No.
-No. Off the beaten path, eh? I got stuck
in a tree once as a kid. BEN:
No bueno, dude. (laughs) I was like,
"It's not. It's a leaf." Big old nothing.
Big old goose egg out here. Charlie, did we
go that way already? I really think, like,
this tree looks promising. CHARLIE:
 The group idol hunts--
 they feel a little fake. I guarantee you, if anyone out here
could find an idol or advantage on their own and in secret, they're gonna keep it
to themselves. JEM:
Keep looking. We'll find it. CHARLIE:
 I want that to be Charlie's idol.
I want that to be mine. JEM:
This is such a unique tree. I feel like
it has to be one in here. CHARLIE:
 If I find something,
 I don't want anyone to hear me screech
 or see the sparkle in my eye when I know
that I have that extra little safety
 in that little, little pouch. JEM:
 I spot the Beware Advantage. I grabbed it and I immediately
 stuck it in my pants. And Charlie's right next to me, so I had to tell myself like,
"Calm down." My heart was like this 'cause
I was so scared in that moment. Come on, little idol. JEM:
 I think I pulled it off 'cause everybody was still
 idol hunting like crazy. In the back of my mind, I was like, "What did I just, like, literally
shove down my pants?" I was like, "I want to read it.
 I want to read it so bad." Oh, my God. I hope that
it's a simple process. I want to go, like,
 dig it up and find out, but I don't want
 anybody to know. I'll go tonight. I don't care
if it's dark and I can't see. At least I know
where I have to go. Finally, it gets pitch dark. We're laying around, and I look
 to see if everybody is asleep. (snoring) I heard Tim start snoring. So, this is the perfect
 golden opportunity to slip away silently. (snoring) My heart's beating, like,
 really superfast because I don't want
 to get caught 'cause that's gonna paint,
 like, a target on my back. But to play this game, you have to be tough
 and you have to take every advantage that you have in order to, like,
 propel you further. So I start digging.
 I can't see anything. Like, literally,
 it's so pitch black. And then, I move some more.
 Like, I dig really deep. And then, I feel a box. My heart just dropped.
 It's a freaking lockbox. And then,
I saw a scroll attached to it. Then it says... "The location of the key
will remain a mystery until after your tribe loses
a future immunity challenge." "Until you have taken possession
of the idol, you cannot vote
at Tribal Council." Oh, my God. What the hell did you
get yourself into, Jem? I just want that idol so bad, like, now more than ever 'cause
I need it to restore my vote. (chopping) What is this man doing now? LIZ:
You're gonna make
a bed right here? Oh, I believe you. Hunter is Survivor MacGyver. Anything that comes to his brain or that the tribe needs,
he can do. SODA:
Where does
he get this stuff from? Must just run in the family, like, the outdoor lifestyle.
You know? He actually doesn't need to talk
 that much strategy right now because he has strength
and we want to keep winning. So, no one wants
 to get rid of him. -(creak)
-SODA: Oh, it made a bed sound. (laughing):
It made a bed sound. LIZ:
 I feel like he's here because he just loves the adventure
of it all. HUNTER:
 I love that people think I'm just here to help the tribe. I'm a very intelligent
individual and I don't want people
to know that. I want to keep that inside. When I was growing up,
 I was always good at school. I graduated college early. I had direct admissions
into medical school. I had a full-ride scholarship. But as I was getting set up
 to go to medical school, I got the opportunity
 to substitute teach for my sister in my hometown. I had just seen Survivor. I fell in love with it. And I said, "I want to build
 a challenge for the kids "before I go off
 to medical school. It'll be my last big thing
 to plan before I go." But being in the classroom and being with the kids day in
 and day out and having kids come to me and say,
 "I really enjoyed that." I was like,
 "Wow. This just feels right." And so I changed from the full-ride scholarship
to medical school. My parents lost their minds,
but I came back and I chose to teach. I also don't think I want
 to advertise that, "Hey, I build challenges
in my backyard." This is what
my house looks like. It's full of puzzles
and stuff left over from previous challenges
that I've done. The drop-down puzzles,
tiles for building towers, more puzzles,
replicas of puzzles, more pieces of puzzles, sandbags thrown,
more stacks of puzzles, more puzzles. So, yes, I am a superfan, but it seems like
a silly thing to share. Uh, it-it's like-it's like
painting a target on my back. Oh, Hunter. Wow. Make me a Tempur-Pedic. VENUS:
 Hunter is just... We see him every season. You know, there's always
that one big buff guy. "I'm the provider.
 You can't vote me out." And as a person, I think Hunter's, like,
a really sweet dude. But also, I can see
right through that facade. Tevin and Hunter
are running this game and if you don't
see that, then... Hunter is running this game? -You don't think so?
-No. -Do you?
-I-I can't see your perspective unless you provide
your perspective. I'm asking you
for your, you know? Uh, my perspective is
I'm not blind. If you just look around,
who has the greatest link with as many people? Hunter has Tevin on lock.
 He has that connection. I want Hunter out

-(cheering) Ow, ow! Nobody going home from Nami. Siga, once again,
immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Siga. Before I send you out of here, we have a journey scheduled
for you today. Nami, you're in charge
of who goes. You're gonna choose
one person from your tribe, one person from Siga
and one person from Yanu. So, first tell me
who's going from your tribe. -Liz.
-Liz is going.
-PROBST: All right. So Liz is going.
All right. Who from Siga's gonna go on this journey? I'm gonna go with Ben. -Who's gonna go from Yanu?
-Bhanu. PROBST:
All right, Liz, Ben and Bhanu, grab your stuff, head out.
Boat's waiting for you. You will return back
to your camp before Tribal. -Be safe.
-Love you. Have fun. PROBST:
All right, Siga, Nami, no Tribal Council,
nobody going home. Your reward will be waiting
for you back at camp. Grab your stuff, head out.
Enjoy the night off. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you, Jeff. All right, Yanu, nothing to say. Seven days already
without flint. I'm keeping it. Sorry for you. You'll have another chance to win it back
at your next immunity challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at Tribal. -See you later, Jeff.
-PROBST: See you later. TIFFANY: Bhanu is absolutely,
 100%, unequivocally the worst person that could
have gone on that journey. Bhanu can't keep his mouth shut. I'm just wondering
 what information he's giving up
 to this other tribe. And I really hope Bhanu doesn't
 get some type of advantage because that's gonna make that
 ten times harder for us to get him out. Survivor is still going strong

the bad karma to this situation? Shocking turn of events, Survivor fans. Yanu got their ass beat again. (laughs) We lost again. How? I don't know. Everything was going so right
and it still went wrong. But at this point,
 losing feels expected for us. Also, out of
all the friggin' people that get picked
to go on the journey, the one who we want to vote out. And I guarantee you his ass
is up there giving it up. "Yeah, me and Tiff are in line. "And me and Q is number one. -Me and Kenzie..."
-"And they all played
a fake idol against Jess." -He's spilling our whole game.
-I know. I know he is up there
giving it up, bro. KENZIE:
 Bhanu getting picked
 to go on the journey was just another typical Yanu bad luck situation. The one thing
we don't want to happen happens. It's almost like this is some weird Survivor karmic curse that we have. I don't know what's going on. What is wrong with us? That's on me. -I-I'm telling y'all.
-BOTH: No, it's not. -Stop.
-No, it's not on you. -No, it's not.
-Q: Listen, we're... I was put in the spotlight to deliver for my tribe, and I let 'em down big time. I choked at the end
 and I didn't get it done. Now my tribe has
to go back to Tribal Council and, you know, I feel horrible. Horrible. As a former Division I athlete, I'm built for moments like this. I'm very, very tough on myself because I understand
 that I can do better. Time to be clutch. You weren't clutch, bro. You weren't clutch at all, bro. One bag. Bro, you couldn't sink one bag. You screwed up. Why should they go home?
Why should you stay? It takes me back to a time when I was in high school. I was the star player or
supposed to be the star player, and I fumbled -with a minute left in the game.
 -(crowd groaning) -(whistle blows)
 -And the other team
 picks it up and win. That following Monday,
 it was huge in the newspaper. "Burdette fumbles." That's a bad feeling. And that is how
 I'm feeling right now. In this game,
 this was my lowest moment. So now I feel like it's up to me to make up for it. I fumbled today, you know? And it don't feel good,
you know? -It's-it's tough on me.
-But it's a bizarre thing. -Q: I know. It was.
-Like, no one has ever...
You couldn't practice that. -But it's not about practice.
-Yeah. It's about execution. He didn't practice, either. And when the time got down, and it was crunch, he clocked in and I didn't deliver. And for me, that's
not-that's not acceptable. So, tonight at Tribal, I'd rather it be me
than, like, somebody like Bhanu. (scoffs) Q, surprisingly, became a martyr and was like, "Vote me out." And I can't get a read on it. It's not his personality,
but it is. It's very confusing. That's what's so crazy
about this game. Like... You don't know what to believe.
You don't know who to trust. It's so bonkers. Q:
I'm serious about this, though. You go on in the game.
Seriously. I'm-I'm being deadass.
I'm deadass. Especially after
today's performance, you know? Oh, give me a break
with the ... self-deprecation. You know damn well
I'm not voting you. Q doesn't handle
 these losses well. I think it's because, like,
 he has this invisible pressure that he's putting on himself, because everybody's looking-- well, I'm not looking to him
for guidance-- but other people are
looking to him for guidance. Like, "Oh, yeah, Coach.
Tell us the game plan," which I think
is stupid and silly, anyway. Why does my road
always have to be the hardest? TIFFANY:
 Why are y'all letting somebody
 coach you through this game that you're supposed
 to be playing for yourself? I think that's dumb.
 I already have a plan. My plan is to vote Bhanu. And fingers crossed that
 he doesn't come back to camp with an idol in his pocket. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thank you. I'm so excited. I'm going on the journey
 with Bhanu and Ben. Hi, friends. What's up, crew? My goal is just to see what is really going on at Yanu.
(chuckles) I'm so curious. Hey, Bhanu,
if I may just say something before we start chilling. I see you putting in the heart. -Yes.
-I see you giving your all. Great players have come back
from far worse, and I don't want you to think that's indicative
of the game you're playing, the situation you're in.
And who knows? We might be able to turn
that around for you right now. -But I'm stoked to be here
with all three of us, all right?
-Yeah. I was just thinking,
it's day seven. Like, congratulations, guys. Thank you. When I prayed this morning,
 was giving gratitude. I asked God, like, you know,
 "Show me a sign that you exist,
that you're listening to me." And there you go, the journey. Bhanu, you want to read? -Are you okay?
-Yeah. (sighs) LIZ:
What? Ooh. -No.

things that do not rock. Literally. -(laughs)
-Okay? (chuckles) Yeah, this is wild. So what does it mean?
The white rock sits out? -Yeah. So, you-you get...
-Yeah. So only -two people move on.
-You don't get to do anything. This is the end. Bhanu, are you guys okay? I... No, I think, um, tonight's
gonna be my last Tribal. Tonight's gonna be my last,
and that's how it's been for me. Would you like a hug? -Okay.
-Come on, buddy. (Bhanu sniffles) Just remember, you still
have a Shot in the Dark, too. -And you still
might win an advantage.
-LIZ: And... -Yeah, who knows? I mean...
-It's, uh... I'm always on the out and
not in any strategy discussions. Tiffany and Q are really tight. -Amen. I can see that.
-Yeah. -You can see that.
Everyone can see that.
-Yeah. And Kenzie's a mastermind. -Kenzie is running
the show at our camp.
-Oh. Kenzie's the one who's actually, like, influencing Tiffany. LIZ:
The brains? BHANU:
Yeah, she's the brain. Whatever order she wanted,
that's happening. And tonight, it's me,
because, of course, she... she wants to stay in the game. And-and Tiffany and Q--
they don't vote for each other. So that-that's my position. LIZ:
 Bhanu has a meltdown,
 so we just let him unravel and he tells us everything. It is a gold mine
of information. So I just stay quiet and I just let him talk. (sobbing):
I need a miracle. LIZ:
 And unless he is Leonardo DiCaprio, I cannot not believe this man. BEN:
This is a game of emotions. So don't be hard on yourself
for being emotional. Make that your fuel. They say that I'm not strategic. They say that I'm-I'm only
emotional, and I'm a fool. -That's all I am.
-They said that? BEN:
That does not rock. -Oh, my gosh. That's just mean.
-BHANU: (sniffles) Yeah. -BEN: Strategies are working.
-BHANU: They said, "You have to know
when to hold and when to fold." I said, like, you know,
"I'm playing with my heart." I'm not strategic, but my poi...
my point being on Survivor is not to win a million dollars. I want to win a million hearts. -That's more important to me.
-Oh. So I'm here for that journey
and not for the money. And everyone knows about that. Well, here's one heart. Here's another, dude. Like Bhanu said, "I didn't come
 to win a million dollars. I came to win a million hearts." A little corny, but, like,
when you're raw like that, it hits.
You know what I'm saying? That's like an Oasis line,
for sure, okay? "A million hearts" on three. One, two, three. ALL:
A million hearts. -All right, Bhanu.
-Go for it. BHANU:
 I'm hoping for a white rock, because if I lose my vote, I can't play

what Jelinsky described. This time, it said, "you guys
have to draw three rocks. "One is a white rock,
two blue rocks. "If you draw a blue rock,
then you have to do something and then you win,
maybe, an immunity" or something like that. If you drew a white rock,
then you have to go home. Like, go to the camp. -KENZIE: Okay.
-BHANU: So we did it.
-You drew the white rock? -That's right.
-TIFFANY: Damn, daddy. And then, yeah,
I just came back, and... that's about the tea. KENZIE: Of course,
 in typical Yanu fashion, he gets nothing,
which works for us, because we didn't want him
to have anything. He drew the white rock. He doesn't have anything. Great for the plan, but it is also just hilarious that, once again,
Yanu loses another thing and gives something else
to the other tribe. Did they ask you about, like, what you think
is gonna happen tonight? I said my name is gonna
be on the chopping block, because that's inevitable, and, um... Okay. Well, thanks for the tea.
That was juicy. The real tea
 is what he gave them about us. I feel like there was more that he might have
 given them, but it doesn't seem like
he got any type of advantage
or whatever from the journey,
 which is a good thing. So now it's not a possibility. It's a definite. Bhanu's going home tonight. Q:
 So you didn't have
 to lose your vote or anything with the white rock? -No?
-What do you think? You lost your vote? I didn't want
to tell in front of them, -but I-I cannot lie to you, man.
It's, like...
-Okay. No, no, no, no,
I'm-I'm with you. Bhanu is just
 in a world of his own. This is too much for him. He has a passion for the game but he doesn't understand
 the game. So he needs a guy like me
 to help him, because, right now,
 Tiff and Kenzie-- they're 100% in with sending Bhanu home. But I have a different plan. I tell you, we have, in this game,
we have liabilities and we have threats. In this game, we want
to get rid of the threats and help the liability
become an asset, which I think
that's what you can be. I want Bhanu to stay. In my world, a liability can be an asset if you use it the right way. And I think Bhanu is the liability, but I can
 control that liability. We're not... Kenzie is a threat. A threat can never
 be used to your favor. At some point
 it's gonna come up and bite. So, for me, I want Bhanu
 to stay in this game and for Kenzie to go home. I'm willing
to put in so much effort to helping you
become the better player. I think once Tiff
understands how much time that I'm willing
to put in with you, she will
change her vote to Kenzie. Kenzie'll go home. BHANU: My game tonight rests in Q's able hands. Put it on me.
I promise I'll fix it. -Okay? I got you covered.
-Bro. How much he can do,
 I don't know, but I still believe in miracles. So let's see. -Hear me out.
-Okay. I've thought about it.
Bhanu will always vote with us. He's gonna vote
 wherever we tell him. We don't know what Kenzie's
 gonna do with herself once she get around
other people. This dude will play the game that we want him to play. Kenzie is gonna play Survivor. She's gonna get over there, she's gonna make bonds,
 relationships. And if it can get her
further in the game, bro, she gonna
get rid of my ass, and she'll get rid of you
to push her way forward. Bhanu has said it over and over:
"I just want to make the jury." Kenzie wants to win. TIFFANY:
 Q was actually making really valid arguments to the point where, like,
I'm even questioning, "Like, dang, like,
maybe-maybe he could be right." Because me, as a Survivor fan, if I was watching somebody play with somebody
 as charismatic and charming and smart
 as Kenzie... I'm really glad we met. TIFFANY:
 ...I probably would be like, "Dang. Like, maybe you do
 need to cut that person." But me, being a Survivor player, and actually having
a relationship with Kenzie, I feel like
Kenzie and I are close. And while
she is savvy and smart, I think she's on my side. Bhanu is a liability,
but Kenzie's a threat to me. I-I agree with you
about everything you said, but I still... My gut is telling me that
it has to be Bhanu tonight. ( ♪ ♪ ) I'm getting

I was like, "Oh, please." LIZ:
Are they putting

Hello. Oh, my God. -LIZ: Hey, Doc!
-RANDEN: Hey, it's Jeff. So... -Oh, no.
-No. Here to talk to you. LIZ: We're sitting on the beach,
 talking about the challenge, and we see Jeff and Dr. Will approaching.
And I think, "This can't be good." I'm sure you can guess
why we're here. Randen. It's about your arm. I'm not gonna lie,
it's not good news. You know, before and after every
challenge, we always check. Medical comes in
and gives you a look. And Will's been monitoring it. After today's challenge, he did a lot more work and research and consulted
a colleague about your injury. Why don't you share
what you learned? DR. WILL:
So, Randen,
when you first had this injury, we were concerned initially
that it was a pinched nerve. And it could
be anywhere from the neck right down to the arm. We thought it was
because of sleeping on the hard bamboo floor,
and it was lower down in the radial,
what we call the radial nerve. PROBST:
And the radial nerve--
that's what allows you -to grip and move, and... Okay.
-That's right. And we thought that your radial
nerve wasn't working properly. Essentially, you put it to sleep
by sleeping on a hard bamboo floor and that's
why your wrist is not working. The thing that's
been concerning me has been this worsening pain
and tenderness in your neck. When I consulted my colleague,
who's a neurosurgeon, -her big concern
was this could be a bulging disc -in your neck,
-(Soda gasps) which presses on the nerve, and that's, I'm afraid,
a very different beast. The radial nerve problem
gets better by itself, but a disc pressing on
the nerve here may need surgery. PROBST:
And the-the obvious problem is that Will can't do that with the kind of assessment
he can do out here. You need an MRI. And so, Randen,
for those reasons, out of just being
very cautious about your health, we are pulling you
from the game. You understand, you don't want to risk something
that could be serious. No, I understand.
I understand, Jeff. I don't want to have
paralysis of any kind. You know what I mean?
I got a life to live, so... And it's unfortunate
that it's an unknown. It could be this radial nerve
and you could be okay, -but Will's been doing
a lot of research
-I know you have. and trying to make sure
that we take care of you, and this is the right move. Oh, my God. I'm listening to every word
the doc is saying. When Jeff said he's gonna
 remove me from the game, I was devastated. I'd rather have gotten
 voted out, like, fighting, you know, but, uh,
 sometimes there's things that are
 just out of your control. Venus, what are you
feeling right now? Honestly, I'm heartbroken
for him, Jeff. This has been
an amazing journey, and he's probably
one of the most amazing people I've ever met. And it's gonna
be hard to picture the rest of this experience
without him, and I'm just really upset. So, Randen, what is the feeling?
You've got, clearly, a lot of love
from this group of people you've been
living with. What's this experience
been like for you? You know, Jeff, uh, the time I spent here, I got
to know these amazing people. You know, every day was a gift. Nobody in my family history has
ever done anything like this. This is an opportunity
of a lifetime, and I cherish all of you. One of you guys
better win a million dollars and keep
the Nami legacy going, winning. You know what I'm saying? -I love all of you guys,
honestly.
-I love you, Randen. -RANDEN: All right?
-I love you, buddy.
-Good job, dawg. Thank you. All right, Randen,
so we have an MRI -already scheduled for you
in the morning.
-Oh, that's great. PROBST:
So we need to get you
out of here, transported, so we can get this looked at. As for the rest of you,
as Survivor always does, it continues on,
and you are now a tribe of five. All right, let's go, Randen.
See you all again. -Hope you feel better tonight.
-Love you, buddy. VENUS:
 My closest ally's going home
with an advantage in his pocket, and it sucks. I'm heartbroken for him, but I'm also very upset that the
one person I could really trust is now gone,
and now I have no one. And it just feels really ... -Thank you, guys.
-LIZ: Love you. SODA: Love you, Randen. Bye! We love you! VENUS:
 I am at the bottom
 of this tribe. My days are numbered, and
 I'm pretty much screwed. But honestly, at this point, I've
realized, in Survivor, you can't predict anything. (Bhanu crying, sniffling) What are you crying for? I don't want
to see you like this. I'm-I'm sorry. This... No, I know. I know. (sighs) I'll be honest with you. Like... I have not decided
to write your name down. BHANU:
I told you I always
respected you all, and sometimes I call you sister, because that-that comes from... straight from my heart, and... Hold up. I know I'm interrupting. I know you got a lot going on,
but I've got news -that's gonna impact tonight.
-Yo, Jeff is here! Hey, Q. Kenzie. -My heart is beating so fast.
-KENZIE: Mine, too. Well, I came in
clearly interrupting a passionate conversation.
I can see it in your face. So I think what
I have to tell you is going to impact all four of you. Randen was pulled from the game. He's had a nerve situation.
There was a lot of concern. So for, you know,
his well-being, we had to pull him
from the game, which means one person's loss is another person's gain. No Tribal Council tonight. -Nobody going home
from this tribe.
-Hug. (laughing) (excited chatter) -Oh, my God.
-See, buddy, I told you. BHANU:
 My prayer's been answered. I'm not going home tonight. Here I am, saying my goodbyes,
 ready to go, and look what happened.
Miracle! I wanted to tell you that,
you know, I came here because you inspired me
to be on Survivor, because you're my guru. That's what brought me here. And I never came to Survivor to win a million dollars. I wanted
to win a million hearts. That's my focus. So I had my speech prepared
for you tonight. (chuckles) PROBST:
No need for the speech.
You might want -to work on your gurus,
but I appreciate the nice words.
-(laughing) BHANU:
 I've been praying all day. And guess what? I'm still in the game, baby. This is the first time
I'm actually, like, smiling and laughing. (laughs) Q, this game
is impossible to predict. What does this moment
offer this group? Second chance, Jeff. You just gave somebody on this tribe a second life, and I'm thankful. Tiff, what's your feeling? I'll be honest with you,
like, I was really struggling, because we've been,
like, losing people left and right. Literally, like,
I said a prayer. I'm like, "God, this is gonna
be hard tonight. Can you please give me a sign?" And then you walk in
five minutes later. I'm so happy,
because I do not want any more people from my tribe
to go home. I really don't. Kenzie, I think
you all are on to something with this approach
that this is a victory. I just left Randen, who is obviously very sad, and yet that
is how Survivor works. His pain is your joy. KENZIE:
Yeah, I mean, it...
Obviously, like, my heart goes out to him, 100%. Like, that sucks, but it's like our first win. You know? Like... I hate to relish in that, but
we got to relish where we can. You know? Well, Survivor is full of turning points. They often come
when you least expect it. This could be the first positive turning point for Yanu. It is the first positive
turning point for Yanu. BHANU:
This is really a positive turn.
Oh, my... All right, I'm gonna
leave the four of you to enjoy the sunset. It'll be a very different night. And the game continues. -Thank you.
-TIFFANY: Thanks, Jeff. -Thank you so much.
-Okay. All right. Good luck. -Thank you.
-Thank you. Q:
 Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close
 she came to going home. But this is a win
 for the Yanu tribe. For the first time,
 we're not going to Tribal. We can keep everyone together. All four members. One happy family. And that feels great. Captioning sponsored by

You're almost there. Finish it up. The money's icing on the cake. It's going to be
 about the experience first. We're gonna come out winners, even if we don't come out
with a million-dollar check, uh, which is unlikely. KEOGHAN:
