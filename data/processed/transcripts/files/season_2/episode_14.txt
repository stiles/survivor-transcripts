         JEFF: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Oh, my gosh!
JEFF: 
 The tribes' spirits were lifted
when a reward challenge brought
 them a message from home. 
Will you marry me, Peas? 
Oh, my God. 
Oh! 
Yes! Yes! Yes! 
JEFF: 
 The constant rain and lack of 
 food led to growing tensions 
between Colby and Keith. 
I'm not going to do 
 this ration thing again 








when we run out of rice, Keith. 
Fine. 
 We are eating fine. 
There's something going on here,
and I'm really in 
 a very vulnerable situation. 
Go! 
Colby won his third 
 immunity in a row... 
Sweet, baby!
...and luckily for Keith, 
despite his self-proclaimed 
 vulnerability, 
it was Rodger who was voted 
 out at Tribal Council. 
Four are left. 
 Who will be the next to go? 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm the last 
 of the Kucha tribe. 
I was lonely last night. 
It's different here 
 without Rodger. 








He's a little treasure 
 I happened to find 
in the outback from Kentucky. 
Good rice. 
It was emotional for me 
to see Rodger be voted out, 
 but he would never want me 
to, you know, get all mushy 
and sad and kind of 
 lay down and die. 
Like, no way, I am gonna... 
I want to win this thing. 
I did not 
think I'd be... 
this game would get me 
so emotionally sometimes. 
It all started when 
 Rodger gave me his rock,
it started the emotional 
 roller coaster. 
That was early, too. 
That was, like, 
 day four or something. 
Today I spent a lot of time 
talking with Tina and just, 
you know, about family, 
 about a lot. 
I think probably with Rodger 
 gone, I miss family more. 
TINA: 
 I miss my husband 
and my children 
 more than anything. 
ELISABETH: 
I miss my family and Tim. 
Just comforts, 
 all the things you love. 
I just miss them all. 
Sometimes 
 I feel as if I'm not... 
here for my life. 
COLBY: 
 I think my mom probably 
 misses me the most, 
just because of 
 how close we are. 
I mean, I know she's 
 the one I miss the most, 
and I know she's the one that 
 has gotten me through all this.
I mean, I talk to her 
on a daily basis when I get off
 and spend time by myself. 
Obviously, 
 she doesn't respond orally, 
but I know she's hearing me. 
TINA: 
 Whenever we very first started 
 playing this game, 
we knew that 
 there were some luxuries 
that we 
could not afford ourself. 
One was thinking about family. 
But now that 
 it's getting towards the end, 
it seems that, you know, 
we can joke around 
 a little bit even, 
and we can laugh about it, 
 and we can keep our sanity. 
I'm going to run 
 to the grocery store. 
Do y'all need anything? 
Oh, yeah, 
 popcorn. 
Stop by the ATM machine 
 and bring us some cash. 
Yeah, that'd
 be great. 
Put gas in 
the car for me. 
ELISABETH: 
 Yeah, there's a lot of, 
kind of make yourself feel 
 a little more normal. 
You know, Colby will run 
to the convenience store 
 and pick up some gum. 
We go to check the mail. 
Checking the mail is probably 
one of the most 
 normal things we do. 
Oh... 
All right, 
 you lazy bones,
we got mail!
ELISABETH: 
 "You know that in life, 
 second chances are rare. 
"And regrets for the past, 
you all have your share. 
"Hope you've learned well 
all the skills of surviving, 
'cause into the winners circle 
 one person is driving." 
Maybe we're driving 
in the challenge. 
I think that's 
 the reward maybe. 
I don't know. 
 Sounds cool, though. 
ELISABETH: 
It does sound cool. 
Come on in.
Well, it's not often 
 that you get a chance 
to make up for past mistakes. 
Today you will. 
Today's challenge 
 combines elements 
of previous challenges 
 you've already done. 
So if you've learned anything, 
 piece of cake. 
If you haven't, 
 you'll be repeating history. 
You're going to start 
blindfolded and shackled. 
And you're going 
 to take a carabiner, 
clip on to a ropes course, 
navigate your way 
 through a series of obstacles. 
When you reach the end 
 of the ropes course, 
you'll ring a bell. 
That'll let you know you can 
 take off your blindfold. 
You'll then move on to the next 
 phase which is a puzzle. 
When you complete 
the puzzle, you get a key. 
That undoes the shackle. 
You move on to the third phase. 
Filling a bucket with water, 
you'll move across a very narrow
 balancing beam 
to your fire and water scale. 
Dump the water 
 into the water bucket. 
Continue this process 
 until you fill it to a point 
where it starts 
 spitting water out. 
When it does, 
 move over to your fire bucket, 
which is held down 
by a taut rope, start your fire.
When the fire burns through 
the rope, the bucket will rise. 
First person to make a fire that
lights the fuse wins the reward.
Wow. 
Now, this is our final
 reward challenge. 
And it's a doozy. 
The reward includes 
a tent, a mattress, 
 four wheels... 
and a key. 
You're playing 
 for a Pontiac Aztec. 
This is a car that converts 
 into a tent. 
The back end opens up. 
It becomes a tent. 
 You have a mattress inside. 
It's pretty cool. 
So, it will be waiting for you 
 when you get back home, 
but I want you 
 to break it in first. 
So tomorrow night, 
you'll convert 
 your new Aztec into a tent. 
You'll have a good night's sleep
 here in the outback. 
You'll also have the use of 
 a hot shower, soap, shampoo... 
Oh... 
 ...and a hot meal. 
Let's go do it. 
Unbelievable. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my God.
A car? 
We are playing for a car? 
JEFF: 
 All right, guys, this is our 
 last reward challenge. 
You're the final four survivors.
Survivors ready!
 Go! 
One carabiner 
 on at all times.
( bell clangs ) 
Take off your 
 blindfold. 
Everybody's still 
 doing well. Keep it up!
( bells clanking ) 
Take off your 
 blindfold, Tina.
You're doing 
 fine, Elisabeth. 
Down to the home 
 stretch. 
( bells clanging ) 
Do not lift anything. 
That's it. 
Remember, it's got to line up 
 with the pattern underneath. 
That's it. 
Slow down 
and think. 
It's got to match 
the pattern underneath. 
That's it. 
That's it.
Take my locks off? 
JEFF: 
 Yes. 
COLBY: 
That-a-way, 
Elisabeth. 
JEFF: 
 Everybody's 
 still very much alive. 
All right, Colby. 
( Tina groans ) 
Come on, baby... Oh! 
JEFF: 
 You're close. 
You're tight. 
This might do it. 
You're good. Fire. 
This will do it, 
Elisabeth. 
You're good. 
They've still got to build fire.
Please be it. 
Jeff? 
JEFF: 
 You're good.
KEITH: 
Go, Tina, go! 
COLBY: 
 Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. 
Yeah! 
Now we're 
 talking! 
You got the car! 
COLBY: 
 I just won a new car. 
I cannot believe it. 
 I never had a new car. 
I won a new damn car. 
JEFF: 
 Way to go, Colby. 
Tomorrow night, you're camping 
 out in your new car. 
COLBY: 
 Got one hell of a winning 
 streak going, 
and I'm just going to ride it 
 as long as I can. 
( birds singing ) 
ELISABETH: 
 This is the most challenging 
 thing I've ever had to do... 
on a daily basis. 
It's not the games. 
 It's not the reward challenge. 
Those are hard in themselves. 
 Like, they'd be hard anywhere. 
Living here day-to-day-- 
 those are the real challenges. 
My hair is 
 falling out.
My hair is falling out. 
My hair has been falling out 
 in a lot of clumps. 
I don't know if I can get one 
right now, but it just keeps... 
Yeah, like, 
 just falls out all the time. 
It's malnutrition. 
See? Look at that. 
The old mailbox. 
Look at that. 
 A scale. 
What do you got there?
Little vanity mirror 
for you, bubba. 
Ooh, don't need
to look at that again. 
 Don't need to 
 look at that. 
"Sure it may work, 
 but it's best not to try it. 
"The pounds melt away 
 on the tough Survivor diet. 
"Living in the outback 
 is not without cost. 
"Just look in the mirror 
and see what you've lost." 
I don't think this
 is a challenge. 
Eh, you know, I think 
it's just pure 
entertainment. 
 KEITH: 
 Yeah, exactly.
We get to take the scale back 
and see how much we weigh. 
Hey, girls, y'all are 
 going to love this. 
What is that, a scale? 
COLBY: 
Yup. 
Oh, no, not
 a mirror. 
A scale and a mirror, 
kids. 
No, I can't do it. 
Come on, Tina, 
step on this baby. 
All right, the, uh... 
It's in kilograms and...
Set on zero. 
One kilo is
 2.2 pounds.
TINA: 
 45 times two. 
I weighed 115 
when I came
 out here. 
 115? 
Oh, my God. 
COLBY: 
You weigh 99 pounds, Tina. 
99? What am I...? 
So I've lost 16. 
 KEITH:
 Wow. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm at 46? 
COLBY: 
 What'd you weigh coming in? 
ELISABETH: 
 Probably about 113. 
101. 
What did I lose?
COLBY: 
 Okay, Keith.
Sixty-five. 
Oh, my God. 
What'd you weigh coming in here?
KEITH: 
170. 
Oh, my God. 
 And what do you 
 weigh right now?
One forty-three. 
Whoa. 
Wait, what did 
you weigh before? 
COLBY: 
 190. 
ELISABETH: 
 And you weighed what? 
 25 pounds I've lost. 
Oh, my God. 
You've lost 27?
27 pounds. 
I've lost...
 The 42-day rice diet. 
Thank you, Australia Outback. 
ELISABETH: 
 Everyone was really shocked. 
There are 20-something pounds 
 lost by Colby, 
almost 30 pounds lost by Keith. 
Tina's at 99. 
She's not even 
 in triple digits. 
And I'm not too far away 
 from that. 
I'm just feeling as though 
 my stomach is eating itself. 
TINA/ELISABETH: 
 Combined. 
TINA: 
 Four people, 
we have lost 85 pounds. 
We've lost a third grader. 
That's scary. You know, 
 I just... I can't believe it. 
Kind of blows your mind. 
Now you know why 
 you're losing all your hair. 
Yeah, now I know
 why my hair is 
 falling out. 
( animals chittering ) 
See you guys in a little bit. 
COLBY: 
All right. 
TINA: 
Bye. Have fun. 
COLBY: 
 Keith goes 
 on little sabbatical walks. 
Keith and I haven't had a whole
 lot of conversation lately. 
I think Keith is trying 
 to figure out 
exactly what his strategy's 
 going to be 
in the next couple of days, 
 and probably also doing 
a lot of thinking 
 about tomorrow's challenge. 
I get the feeling 
 that Keith feels 
like he needs to win tomorrow. 
KEITH: 
 If my legs hold out, 
I'm going to go 
 up to the top of this ridge. 
You can see 360 degrees 
over the whole plate land 
 of the outback here. 
It's a magnificent view... 
 but it's a long walk. 
COLBY: 
 I'm so pumped.
ELISABETH: 
You should be. 
This is unbelievable. 
Unbelievable. 
You've waited--
 you've been so 
 patient. 
I have been patient. 
 And you are 
 excited today.
Yesterday, shocked. 
Today, excited. 
Today, I'm pumped. 
 ELISABETH:
 Yes. 
COLBY: 
 I'm just counting 
 down the minutes, 
and hopefully going to, uh... 
get a look at my new ride, 
my new wheels, 
 and a hot meal tonight. 
Colby, 
here's you some flowers.
Oh, my gosh. 
Look at that. 
Thank y'all so much.
Enjoy it. 
COLBY: 
 The girls surprised me 
 with a little car-warming gift 
in lieu of a housewarming gift,
 like when you get a new house. 
A lot of people 
 you deal with in this game 
are-are disingenuous. 
They're just... It's not real. 
But with those two girls, 
 I really believe it is. 
I'm so excited. 
 That is beautiful.
( women laughing ) 
TINA: 
 Look to your right.
 Oh, here's Jeff. 
What's up, Jeff? 
 JEFF: 
 Wow. 
What's going on? 
How you doing? 
JEFF: 
 You ready to get
 out of Dodge? 
COLBY: 
Yes, sir. 
I'm so excited. 
 JEFF: 
 Your chariot awaits,
as does a really nice hot shower
and a hot meal, and
 we got enough grub,
I'm going to join you, 
 if that's cool. 
Oh, perfect. 
Where's Keith? 
We don't know. 
He took off on a walk. 
Oh! We love you! 
I wish I could take 
y'all with me. 
Well, we wish 
 you could, too. 
Hey, Colby, 
 enjoy your time.
COLBY: 
Thank you so much. 
You have a good night. 
Well, wherever
 Keith is at, 
 Let's roll. 
say-say hello.
Okay. 
 JEFF: 
 All right.
Have a great time. 
 Bye, Jeff.
JEFF: 
 See you guys. 
See y'all in the morning. 
Bye, Colby. 
See you in the morning, 
Colby. 
( Colby howls ) 
Bye, Colby. 
Knowing that that was 
 the last reward challenge, 
and I couldn't pull one out 
 was kind of sad. 
When you come so close 
to something-- you almost touch
 that car and have 
that warm meal, 
 and then you don't get it... 
I want the prize at the end. 
That's it. Simple. 
And I was thinking a little bit 
 about Rodger. 
I miss him. 
And I really want Keith 
 to come back so we can eat. 
KEITH: 
 We all find ourselves 
 doing more 
of a going off and being 
 by yourself time, 
uh, and thinking. 
I think what I spent 
 so much time thinking about 
is my family, my children, 
 my parents, 
and of course, my fianc?e. 
And I know that I-I see 
 the light 
at the end of the tunnel now. 
It's-it's real close now. 
You don't have a lot of control
 at this stage of the game. 
The cards have been dealt, 
 and fate is inevitable, 
so it makes the most sense 
just to kind of glide in, 
 be cool and calm, 
enjoy these last few days 
 the best you can. 
COLBY: 
 Which, by the way, 
 I'm still 
in disbelief-- 
a car. 
 Yeah. 
I know, it is kind of...
You guys gave 
away a car 
for a reward. 
 It's kind of... Yeah. 
It is pretty cool. 
Sweet! It's yellow! 
Look at that thing!
She looks good!
How wild is
 this thing?
God, look at the interior 
 on this... 
Now, this is a trip. 
It's awesome. 
I mean, the car is way cooler 
than I thought 
 it was going to be. 
And then here's the stereo 
and stuff under here. 
And it's got some 
 of the neatest amenities 
a vehicle's ever had. 
You know, you got a stereo 
 in the back of it, 
not to mention a huge tent. 
This is unbelievable! 
Yeah. 
Dude, you got 
 to be hungry. 
Too much. I'm starving. 
Let's eat.
Let's grub, definitely. 
What's going on here? 
A little appetizer.
Have another cracker. 
You want to chew on this 
 for a while, or you want me 
to bring out 
the good food? 
Oh, yeah, 
 bring it on.
All right. 
 Let's see 
 what we got.
Bring out the food, 
please. 
Oh, here comes 
our food. 
Thanks. 
Oh, my God!
( laughter ) 
 Mother! 
Oh, my God. 
 What are you doing? 
God... 
One thing you don't realize 
 how much you miss until you... 
you're here is the touch 
and the intimacy of loved ones. 
Oh, my, gosh! 
Oh, Colby. 
COLBY: 
 Being able to hold somebody 
 and hug 'em-- 
that's one of the significant, 
 uh, importances 
of having my mom here, 
just because she brings some 
of my daily normalcy back to me.
I got something for you. 
Two girls gave me, 
instead of a housewarming gift, 
a car-warming gift, 
and they went out and found me 
 some wild flowers, 
and so we'll
 set that... 
 Oh... 
How pretty. 
 Their names are 
 Tina and Elisabeth,
and they're two 
 incredible women. 
I can't believe you're here. 
 I don't even know... 
 ( Mom laughs ) 
I can't, either. 
 I don't know 
 even how to act.
It doesn't feel 
 like we're together.
This is just 
totally weird. 
Mm. 
( laughing ) 
First of all, 
 you know what I've
 had to eat today? 
Four spoonfuls
 of rice. 
That's our meal.
And that's all? 
That's our meal, 
 Mother, twice a day.
Seeing Colby 
 after this length of time-- 
there's a look in his eyes 
 that bothers me a lot, 
and I think it's... 
it's probably from hunger 
and emotional isolation. 
After 38 days, I've been 
 to the bathroom three times. 
Colby... 
 Three times
 in 38 days.
It breaks my heart 
 when I look at him. 
I knew he would... that he was 
 going to lose weight, 
but... as his mother, 
I wasn't really prepared... 
to-to see how much weight 
 he's lost. 
I mean, it's been 
 so frustrating 
losing weight and being so weak 
 all the time. 
I mean, 
 you can't imagine 
how weak on a daily
 basis we are. 
We're just lethargic. 
It's just... 
 the days are so long. 
Oh, now, we're talking! 
( sighs ): 
 There you are. 
You asleep yet? 
I feel horrible. 
Seems like we've been here 
 for six months. 
So, a lot of it's been tough 
emotionally, too. 
( sighs ) 
It's so hard to imagine 
that the four of
 us that are left
have made it through
 all of this. 
I mean, we say
our prayers every night 
at how fortunate 
 we are to still be here, 
'cause it's so easy 
 to get kicked off. 
And you just got to keep 
 your head in the game, 
'cause it's so close now, 
and it's so important 
 to play hard. 
I mean, that's all 
 I've ever done 
from day one is play 
 as hard as I can. 
( squawking ) 
Oh! 
Oh! This is by far 
the most refreshing shower 
 I've ever had. 
This morning was awesome. 
Uh-oh. 
 ( laughing )
I think that's it 
 for the old shower.
Oh!
Out of everything 
 that took place 
in the last 24 hours, 
 the hot shower 
I was looking forward 
 to the least. 
However, now 
that it's done, I think 
 I enjoyed it the most 
next to-to being able 
 to visit with my mom. 
I had no idea 
having a hot shower 
 would feel so good. 
TINA: 
 That's a big log. 
No way.
ELISABETH: 
 I love how we 
 always wait 
for Colby's
 stories. 
"Colby, tell us 
 how it is in the
 lap of luxury." 
Yeah. 
 ( laughter )
( indistinct chatter ) 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, hang on, 
 hang on, hang on. 
Keith, this 
 thing broke off.
I need foil.
Hold on. 
We did lose a lot. Look. 
How's my family doing? 
( howls ) 
I see a... 
( indistinct chatter ) 
Look what I brought. 
Welcome to Barramundi! 
Tina, oh, oh, oh. 
Welcome back. 
I've missed y'all.
But meet my mom.
Hello. 
TINA: 
 We see Colby coming up, 
and along with Colby 
 is this person 
with a pink sweater on, 
 and it was Colby's mom. 
KEITH: 
I am your personal chef. 
You get some love. 
 I heard. 
Mr. Cook. 
TINA: 
 She gave us all 
a big hug, and she said, 
"This is a hug from home." 
( laughter ) 
And-And I know what
 the state he was in
when he started out.
Yeah. 
 And he just...
It just breaks my 
 heart that y'all...
ELISABETH: 
 Colby's mom was... 
She was like the token 
 loved one from home. 
Lots of hugs. 
ELISABETH: 
 I think we were all able 
 to feel that love and feel that
care that we've been missing 
 for so long. 
I mean, when she hugged me, 
I felt my whole family there. 
Well, it's an honor 
 to have you here. 
Well, thank you. 
COLBY: 
Come look 
where we're living... 
I am honored to be here. 
 This is our house. 
COLBY: 
And this is the lean-to 
that we sleep in. 
COLBY'S MOM: 
Home sweet home. 
COLBY: 
Yes, it is, 
home sweet home. 
So, is it what you thought 
 we'd be living in? 
No, it's a little cruder 
 than what I thought, 
actually. 
Well, four more days 
 of this. 
You want to sit down? 
We've got chairs 
 here for everybody. 
COLBY: 
 Yeah. Sit, Mom.
Keith... 
Grandma's gonna sit up here. 
I might not get up again 
 if I sit on the ground. 
Keith, the, uh, 
the Yanks won the World Series. 
Oh, really? Wow.
TINA: 
Can you tell us information? 
I really don't 
 want to sit down. 
Yeah, it's question
 and answer time. 
TINA: 
 Can you tell us 
 things like, um,
President and 
 what's going on?
Tell me what's happened. 
And it was, like, 
 oh, my goodness. 
ELISABETH: 
 To hear stuff that's going on 
 at home, 
it makes you feel as if 
 the world doesn't really stop 
without you, it keeps going. 
Our homes at home are... 
News is happening, and 
life goes on. 
COLBY: 
 Right in the middle 
 of conversation, 
Mom gets up, kind of takes off 
 for a second 
and comes back like Santa Claus
with a big burlap sack 
 over her arm, and 
kind of throws it on the rug 
 in front of us and says, 
"I can't leave 
 without giving you guys 
something to go on." 
But I think there 
 may be some things
in here y'all might...
Oh, my gosh! 
Oh, my God. No. 
What is it? 
I'm shaking. 
What it is? 
 Oh, my God. 
( screams )
My gosh. 
COLBY: 
 And she brought back 
 care packages 
for Tina and Elisabeth 
 and Keith from their families. 
Oh, my mom! 
Thank you so much! 
Oh, man. 
Oh, my God. 
TINA: 
Oh, Keith got pictures! 
...Gosh, she's beautiful! 
Oh. 
Oh, my gosh.
( clears throat ) 
Look at this. 
Look at my 
 daughter's legs.
KEITH: 
 Still had a moment. 
I mean, me looking 
 at the pictures of my kids, 
and reading letters 
 from my girlfriend and stuff...
It was... It hits, you know... 
It's hard not to hold back. 
I mean... we only have 
a few days left, but it's hard. 
You have done 
 a marvelous job
with this young man.
If my daughter marries
 a man like Colby, 
I'll feel very
 fortunate. 
You did an 
 incredible job.
I really and truly cannot 
 take all of the credit. I... 
( laughs ) 
KEITH: 
Well, it seems like all those...
I did help raise 
 him, but you know...
KEITH: 
It seems like all those beans...
...he came 
 from a gene pool. Not... 
COLBY: 
 It's almost 
 like a conjugal visit if-if 
you were a prisoner-- you know, 
 having... having someone 
that can come see you, 
 but you've got a piece 
of Plexiglas in between you 
 and that person or something. 
It was, in a way, like that, 
 'cause it was bittersweet. 
I knew she was gonna be here, 
 but I also knew 
she was gonna get taken away. 
( helicopter whirring ) 
My outback mom.
( indistinct chatter ) 
KEITH: 
 I will... I 
 will be there,
and I will cook 
 a dinner for you, 
I promise.
 Okay. 
We'll take good 
 care of Colby, okay?
Well, you get to ride 
in style, don't ya? 
I guess.
Tell everyone I can't 
 wait to get back. 
Warn 'em how skinny
 and hairy I am. 
( laughs ) 
I told you I was 
 skinny and hairy. 
Mmm. I love you.
I love you, too. 
Be careful. 
( engine revving ) 
ELISABETH: 
 You all right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it felt... 
 it felt good. 
TINA: 
 What a lady.
What a woman. 
She really
 is, Colby.
COLBY: 
 I'm so lucky that to... 
to have happen 
 what-what has happened 
over the last day and a half, 
but now it's time 
 to shift gears. 
Now it's time to go play. 
We got to go do a challenge, 
and then, inevitably, 
 go to a Tribal Council night 
and get rid of one 
of those three people up there, 
if not myself. 
How weird is that? 
COLBY: 
Oh, look what I got! 
A Texas flag bandanna. 
How cool is that? 
 KEITH: 
 Oh, somebody... 
I still got my lone star pride 
 going, man. 
KEITH: 
 Hope you don't 
 wear that tonight.
COLBY: 
Yes, sir. 
That's way cool. 
KEITH: 
 Not a whole lot 
 I can do right now. 
You go in and do the best 
 you can on these immunities. 
If you come out 
 holding the immunity, 
then your position is set. 
If you don't come out 
 holding your immunity, 
you better have your bags packed
 when you go to Tribal Council. 
Oh, you combed
 your beard. 
I haven't gotten 
 to do that today...
COLBY: 
 My only loyalty is-is to Tina. 
There's no other loyalty 
 for me, so 
it could be Keith or Elisabeth 
 I'm gonna vote for. 
I think both of them 
need immunity to save themselves
 at this point. 
JEFF: 
 All right.
You guys have been out here 
 39 days. 
Your once strong bodies
 are withering away. 
The question is,
how sharp have 
 you been able to
 keep your minds?
That's what we're 
 gonna find out today. 
Today's immunity challenge 
 requires one thing-- memory. 
There are 36 covers with an item
 underneath each one of them. 
18 matching pairs in all. 
Your goal-- uncover as many 
 of those pairs as you can. 
One at a time, you'll go out, 
and you'll get to uncover 
two items, any two items 
 you want. 
If they match up, 
 take it back to your bench. 
If they don't, 
 you replace the cover, 
next person goes. 
The tribe member that gets 
the most matches gets immunity. 
All right, so I 
 guess I need that.
This thing is molding 
 itself to your neck. 
I hate to give it up today. 
JEFF: 
 You've already
 drawn straws 
to determine
 the order. 
Let's play. 
Keith, you're up first. 
 Get us started. 
( clears throat ) 
JEFF: 
 Nest. 
JEFF: 
 Femur bone.
JEFF: 
 All right, Tina.
JEFF: 
 Wooden 
kangaroo. 
JEFF: 
Gourd. 
Elisabeth. 
JEFF: 
 An emu egg.
JEFF: 
Wooden kangaroo. Colby. 
JEFF: 
Wooden kangaroo. 
And a match. 
One match for Colby. 
Keith, you're up. 
Snake, 
wooden snake. 
Wooden turtle. 
Bull 
roarer. 
Jawbone. 
There's the urchin. 
Nicely done, Tina. 
Nice job, 
good match. 
Good job. 
Flute.
Another match 
 for Colby. 
Nice match, Keith. 
Still anybody's game. 
Elisabeth.
( laughing )
JEFF: 
 Call this 
 roo doo. 
Kangaroo... doo.
COLBY: 
 Why don't you 
 pick that up 
off the plate 
 there, Elisabeth? 
Looks like burnt marshmallows. 
Boy, you are hungry. 
( laughing ) 
JEFF: 
 Clay pot. 
Oh! 
COLBY: 
Nice! 
JEFF: 
 Out of the blue.
I'll take that.
Nice match, Keith.
Colby,
he's catching 
 up to you. 
Here's where 
 we're at, guys.
Colby gets one
 more right, 
he clenches victory,
 wins immunity, 
can't be voted
 out tonight. 
Colby, you're up. 
JEFF: 
Jawbone. 
Does he remember? 
No, he does not. 
You were the one 
 who uncovered it. 
( laughs ): 
 I know, and I... 
I can't remember where 
 I just uncovered that thing. 
JEFF: 
 Jawbone.
That's it.
Immunity again for Colby. 
JEFF: 
 Well done.
COLBY: 
 Thank you.
This has had a
 permanent home
here for a while. 
Been pretty fortunate. 
JEFF: 
 You guys have 
 a few hours 
before Tribal 
 Council. 
I don't know how 
 you're gonna vote,
I don't know how you're
 gonna figure this out, 
but you can head
 back to camp and
 think about it. 
ELISABETH: 
 Look at them. 
Two of them.
KEITH:
 Where?
Right back there, this way. 
KEITH: 
Oh, yeah. 
Colby's mom is gone 
and we've had 
 our little interlude-- 
our intermezzo, if you will. 
The game is back on. 
It's anybody's game right now 
as far as who's going 
 to be in the last three. 
Anybody's game. 
No matter what 
 happens tonight,
that changes, 'cause
 one of us is gone. 
I know. 
And that's a 
 harsh reality.
TINA: 
 There is a sense 
 of doom and gloom 
about Tribal Council. 
I don't want to go. 
TINA: 
 And it seems that 
 the day of Tribal Council, 
people are whispering 
 and talking, 
and a little bit of paranoia 
 sets in, too. 
You don't have as many people 
 to choose from to kick off. 
You know, 
 there's only four of you, 
and one of you's got to go. 
COLBY: 
 I still haven't made up my mind
as far as who I'm going 
 to vote for. 
It comes down to two things-- 
 strategy or philanthropy. 
On one hand, you got 
 who deserves it, 
who's a righteous person, 
 who needs that money? 
Or the other side 
 is use strategy. 
How can I get that? 
How can I put that money 
 in my pocket? 
That's something we've 
all weighed from day one-- 
how bad do you want the money? 
We now bring in the jury. 
The jury 
has now grown to five-- 
all five of them 
sitting there, 
due in no small part to votes 
cast from 
the four of you. 
Tonight, 
one of you 
will be leaving this side 
 of Tribal Council 
and moving to the jury side. 
Let's talk about what's gone on 
 the last three days. 
Because in that time span, 
Colby's had 
a whole lot of activity 
going on. 
Tina, as he wears 
 the immunity necklace again, 
how frustrating 
is it 
to not be able to beat him? 
It's frustrating
that he got 
 all the food challenges, 
and he goes away 
and eats and eats and eats, 
and some of us have got no food.
But it's not 
one of those things 
that you resent him 
at all, because on some level, 
you have to admire someone 
who is that type 
of a quality person, 
who has all those attributes 
that allows him to win 
 all these challenges. 
Keith, do you still 
 feel competitive? 
Oh, sure, 
there's no question. 
I mean, you know, 
going into 
 the physical challenges 
are more difficult now 
 because I've lost 27 pounds. 
This is kind of 
an astonishing thing for me. 
And it takes a lot 
for me 
to get up to go to fill 
the truck up with gas, 
and do anything 
real strong physically. 
Coming in, I was very strong, 
 and I was fast, and... 
But I've seen 
 it tremendously.
Colby, provided you make it 
to the final two, 
what kind of impact 
 do you think tonight's vote-- 
how you vote specifically-- 
 will have on the jury? 
COLBY: 
That's by far 
the toughest part 
of this part 
of the game 
is, you know, 
 you sit here 
and you throw around
 the word "strategy."
Well, if you're 
 playing strategically,
you've got to 
 look at them 
and think if you're 
going to be strategic, 
you've got to think 
about what they're thinking. 
We have no idea. 
And you can, you know, 
 maybe up your stock 
or cut your throat 
 in the same night, 
and you won't know 
 until it's too late. 
Elisabeth, 
why are you voting 
the way you're voting tonight? 
What's it based on? 
I vote on my gut. 
I have always 
 since I was little. 
I mean, my parents 
 have taught me 
let your conscience 
 be your guide, 
and I have a very 
strong conscience, 
I have a very strong 
gut instinct, 
and that's how I have voted 
 from day one. 
Um, and I just... 
I think about the right thing, 
 and I do it. 
Let's vote. 
Keith, you're up. 
KEITH: 
 I've said it before, 
 I'll say it again. 
I think you're an 
 absolutely wonderful person, 
and someday 
 I would love my daughter 
to spend a day with you, 
 'cause I think she can learn 
a great deal from you. 
Good luck to you, Elisabeth. 
Well, even though 
 you've calmed down 
your cockiness a bit, 
'cause I think we've all felt 
a little more vulnerable 
 lately, 
you're still my vote. 
Nothing personal today. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person 
 voted out of the tribe 
will be asked to leave the 
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read 
the votes. 
First vote... 
Elisabeth. 
Keith. 
Elisabeth. 
Last vote... 
Elisabeth. 
You need 
to bring me your torch. 
Go get 'em, guys. 
Play hard, and, uh, 
 try and wear that thing. 
Elisabeth, 
the tribe has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Good-bye. 
Well, it's come down to this. 
Three days, 
two Tribal Councils, 
one winner. 
You can head back to camp. 
My part of the game is over. 
It's been the most trying 
 experience of my life, 
filled with the most highs and 
 lows in a short period of time 
that I could have 
 ever imagined. 
I know that they 
 just didn't want me 
to get into the final two 
because I would have kicked 
 some major butt 
in that situation.
