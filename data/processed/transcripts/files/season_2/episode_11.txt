 --- 

         Previously on Survivor: 
Food was scarce, 
 fishing was tough. 
Tina! I got a line hung up! 
And they were dangerously low 
 on rice. 
JERRI: 
 One more meal of rice 
 is all we have left? 
TINA: 
 At the most two. 
Jerri wanted to team up 
 with Colby 
for the reward challenge, 
but the tribe insisted 
 on drawing names 
from a hat. 
Ironically, 
 she ended up with Colby anyway,








and they went on 
 to win the event... 
and spent a day 
 at the Great Barrier Reef. 
JERRI: 
 This is basically 
 the perfect honeymoon 
without the sex. 
JEFF: 
 Nick won 
the immunity challenge. 
Yeah, baby! 
In a departure 
 from previous Tribal Councils, 
Ogakor voted against 
 one of their own. 
Jerri, Jerri, Jerri, 
that knock you keep hearing on 
 your door, it's checkout time. 
JEFF: 
 And Jerri was booted 
 from the tribe. 
Jerri, 
the tribe has spoken. 
Seven people left. 








Who will be voted out tonight? 
( bird warbling ) 
AMBER: 
 Last night at Tribal Council, 
Jerri got voted off, 
and I think that the group 
 definitely isolated me 
from their decision 
 because they thought 
that I was too close to Jerri. 
And... I felt sad, 
not only because 
 of Jerri leaving, 
but, I think, more so 
 because it made me feel 
like my own tribe members 
 didn't even trust me enough 
to let me know 
 what was going on. 
I felt really left out, 
 and I hated that feeling. 
Hey, good morning. 
KEITH: 
 I think Amber made 
 a tactical mistake 
by staying tight with Jerri. 
But she was visibly... 
 stunned last night 
that that took place, too. 
She didn't see it coming. 
So she probably felt 
she lost her... 
her big sister comrade 
 last night, 
and she's kind of a lone lamb 
out in the midst 
 of the rest of us now. 
And, uh... 
she's a big girl, you know? 
She made that decision early on,
 and that's where she sits now. 
There's nothing can be done 
 about it. 
? Ding-dong, the 
 witch is dead... ?
( whistling melody )
( chuckling ) 
The mood'll probably 
be better around here. 
This is how much rice 
 we have left 
to last us 14 days. 
This is probably... 
enough for one serving. 
I got to keep this-- 
this is the closest 
to a six-pack 
I've ever had. 
COLBY: 
 You know, we're in a spot now, 
but it's not the end 
 of the world. 
My gosh, the human body 
 can go days without food. 
Where the lack of food comes in
is mentally, and you got 
 to stay tough mentally 
to make it through 
 a food drought 
like we have right now, 
 and, um, 
you can sit around and say, 
 "What if?" 
You know, 
 "What if we would've saved?" 
Well, we didn't. 
 We don't have any rice. 
Woulda, coulda, shoulda, 
 you know, 
if ifs and buts 
 were candy and nuts, 
we'd all have a merry Christmas.
TINA: 
 And if we don't catch our food,
we won't be eating any food. 
Here on out, you know, 
 it's gonna have to be... 
everybody working together, 
 catching... 
crickets, grubs, 
 whatever we can find, 
in order 
 to have people fishing, 
and that's no easy task 
 on its own. 
ELISABETH: 
 You know, we're starving. 
We haven't eaten 
 in 24 hours, and... 
we had a lot to do 
 and no energy-- none. 
Everyone here 
 was just in slow motion. 
You know, I think everyone here 
 would bring back Jerri 
if we had rice to come with her.
( laughs ) 
Oh! ( chuckles ) 
Got him. 
Look at that. 
You show me Colby doing that. 
A cowboy can ride 
 bulls and horses, 
but he can't catch grasshoppers.
Oh, look at that! Coming out. 
You know what? 
 I had two grasshoppers 
this morning, and a frog. 
But the big ones, you can't even
tire those guys out, man. 
They fly forever 
and are very scarce, 
so you can't sneak up on those. 
The ones everybody's 
 been fishing with 
is the little bitty ones, 
which are pretty easy to catch. 
I haven't seen any lately. 
KEITH: 
 Yeah, I mean, 
you expend a lot of energy 
to try catching grasshoppers. 
You chase them down, 
 I mean, you'll run sometimes 
for 100 yards... not 100 yards.
You'll run sometimes 
 for several yards 
chasing a grasshopper down, 
but that grasshopper 
 could mean a, you know, 
a 15-inch black bream, 
 so it's very important. 
There he goes. 
COLBY: 
 I think Keith probably 
 has the upper hand 
on the whole 
 grasshopper wrangling. 
A little more experience 
 under his belt. 
You know, he's been 
 at it a while, 
and he kind of 
 has a handle on it. 
Just kind of stun them 
 a little bit. 
COLBY: 
 I've yet to figure out 
 his method, 
but I may have to go 
 to the master 
so he can teach 
 young grasshopper 
how to wrangle grasshoppers. 
Excuse me. 
 I just caught a grasshopper. 
Kind of important. 
Oh, no. 
It's like the 747 
 of grasshoppers. 
There you go. I took 
a wing and a leg off. 
You did?
I was hungry. 
Thanks. 
I'm close to that. 
Oh...! 
A turtle. 
I hate those turtles. 
I'm going to try and keep calm. 
I don't know whether to break 
 this rod or try and eat it. 
E-mail. 
"Elisabeth."
What is in here? 
 There's, like,... 
Money in there. 
 What is this? 
 What is this? 
Wait, hold on, 
let me read the clue. 
"For this next challenge, 
you'll have to be shrewd, 
It's time to find out 
the real value of food." 
Priceless.
"If you don't believe a snack 
 is worth more than gold, 
"Watch it going once, 
 going twice, 
and then it will be sold." 
We're going 
 to an auction.
We all have a certain amount 
of money to auction on food. 
ELISABETH: 
 Colby, you have money.
Check it out--
 money. 
RODGER: 
Wow! 
AMBER: 
 Yes, it's real money. 
Colby, they could get 
 us some peanut butter...
But I think we'll all 
be getting something. 
Wow, I'm excited. 
I'm excited. 
You guys, we'll
 get something. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
JEFF: 
 Okay, guys, welcome 
 to the Survivor auction. 
You each have 
500 Australian dollars. 
Up for bid-- 
a variety of food items. 
If you see something 
 you desire, bid on it. 
I'll tell you 
what the bidding starts at. 
The increments are $20. 
First item-- 
$60 for four tasty Doritos 
and a nice big old thing 
 of salsa to go with it. 
Wow! 
60 bucks; Nick? 
These are the real deal, Tina. 
I know how much 
 you like Doritos. 
I do, but that's 
more than $10 a chip. 
Ouch! 
All right, going once, twice, 
sold to Nick for 60 bucks. 
 Come on down. 
Oh, my gosh! 
Enjoy those babies! 
NICK: 
 20, 40, 60.
Mmm! 
You can take it back up. 
Next item-- 
how about a little dessert? 
AMBER:
 Uh-oh!
Big old thing of peanut butter, 
four squares of chocolate. 
We'll start 
the bidding at... 
oh, 80 bucks. 
 AMBER: 
 80 bucks. 
80 bucks. 
 80 bucks. 
100. 
120. 
JEFF: 
 120 
140. 
JEFF: 
 140, Elisabeth. 
Amber? 
 160. 
That's a lot 
of peanut butter. 
160, Amber. 
 ELISABETH: 
 180. 
180, Elisabeth. 
Going once. 
200. 
200, Colby. 
220. 
$220 
for peanut butter and chocolate.
Going once... 
240. Tina. 
NICK:( laughing ) 
 "Sorry, I know she wants it." 
You know what? 240.
I know that that's 
 something that I'd eat. 
260, Elisabeth, 
going once, 
twice, 
sold to Elisabeth. 
Oh, my gosh, oh, 
 my gosh, oh, my gosh. 
Bring a tear to your eye. 
I would have paid 
 300 for that. 
This is my favorite 
game in the whole world. 
I'm shaking. 
 JEFF: 
 Right on. 
Go back and enjoy. 
 ...stick it here 
 so it doesn't fall.
Boy, you are shaking. 
I am. 
Wow! 
( distant thunder rumbling ) 
Mountain Dew. 
Sold to Amber for $80. 
Mmm. 
Sold to Nick-- 
three crackers for 120. 
Sold to Keith for 180-- 
 take a bite. 
Sold to Tina-- 
 she's on the board. 
Sold to Nick 
for a hundred dollars. 
Six French fries, 
and a big old dish 
of ranch dressing to dip it in. 
Sold to Amber. 
Mmm! Mmm! 
Iced coffee and chocolate 
peanut butter energy bar. 
A little bit of protein. 
100. 
JEFF: 
 Amber, 100. 
120, Colby. 
140. 
140, Amber. 
160, Colby. 
180. 
180, Amber. 
200, Colby. 
We found something Colby wants. 
220. 
220 Amber. 
240, Colby. 
Damn you. 
260. 
260 to Amber. 
280 to Colby. 
Going once, twice, 
sold to movie star for 280. 
We're eating, baby! 
Big-ticket item right there. 
Plenty more where 
 that came from. 
Mmm. On-target right there. 
Thanks, Jeff. 
Right on. 
Anybody got any money left? 
Yes. 
Oh, okay. Good. 
Yeah, we got 
 a lot left. 
Good, 'cause 
 I got a nice meal here. 
ELISABETH: 
 Hold on, hold on. 
Is that mashed potatoes 
 I see there? 
Mashed potatoes, 
 bread, turkey, 
a little veggie on there. 
I'm thinking this is worth 
a lot at this point. 
Let's start at 180. 
180. 
180, Amber. 
200, Tina. 
 220 to Elisabeth. 
240, Keith. 
Can I get a loan? 
Can you sell me 
 one piece of your turkey 
Yes. 
and half of your 
mashed 
potatoes? 
 Yes. 
260 to Elisabeth. 
Keith owns it at 280. 
ELISABETH: 
 Did you give me 20?
Yeah, and I'll give you 20 more,
if you want to go 300. 
And I'll sell her-- 
 I can sell her half?
300 to Elisabeth. 
320. 
That's all he has. 
ELISABETH:
 340. 
340, Elisabeth. 
Anybody else 
in on that? 
One, two, three, 
sold to Elisabeth. 
( squealing ) 
Yes! 
 Yeah. 
Go, girl! 
JEFF: 
Come on down. 
340, yours. 
Mystery plate. 
We'll start this at 120. 
120. 
120, Amber. 
140, Keith. 
160. 
160, Amber. 
Thinking about it, 
Rodger? 
JEFF: 
180. 
200. 
200 to Amber. 
Once, twice, 
three times. 
200 for the mystery plate. 
NICK: 
 Let's see what it is. 
I hope it's good. 
Gosh, I'll be upset. 
That's a tall glass 
of Herbert River water. 
( other exclaiming ) 
( chuckling ) 
We read that 
one right, didn't we? 
Rodger, I think I have 
something you might like. 
You cannot tell me 
you are not interested 
in a cheeseburger? 
 Oh, God!
Oh, my God.
That one's 
 coming up here, son. 
JEFF: 
$200. Rodger? 
220. 
240, Rodger. 
260, Keith. 
280, Rodger. 
Three. 
300, Keith. 
 How much 
 money you got? 
JEFF: 
320, Rodger. 
Let me at it! 
Oh, go ahead, hit the gavel. 
I'm-I'm ready. 
Once, twice, sold 
to Kentucky Joe. 
Whoo! All good things 
 come to those who wait. 
Frugal Fannie. 
Mmm. 
Boy, that's good. 
Thank you. Mmm. 
ELISABETH: 
 The green latrine. 
TINA: 
 I'm not feeling well. 
AMBER: 
 I think I'm the only 
 one that's feeling well.
I can't believe it 
would go through you that fast. 
I was feeling sick. 
I thought I was going 
 to vomit, 
to tell you truth. 
I guess because I hadn't 
 had hardly any food. 
Ohh... my belly. 
And I ate the cheeseburger
and now I think I'm going 
 to have to make a trip 
over the hill to the latrine. 
I gotta use the restroom. 
TINA: 
 I think that our body 
 is so stripped 
of any kind of nutrition-- 
 you know, 
I had turkey and 
mashed potatoes and some bread--
and it's just... 
 it's just going 
"rrrr." 
You know, 
my body's trying to process it, 
and it's just 
 not going too good. 
Whereas I paid $200
 for river water. 
But you know what?
Somebody had to
 do it, right? 
And here's the deal. 
You paid 200 bucks 
for river water, 
and yet 
you and I are standing here, 
everybody else 
is trying to find paper bark 
so they can 
wipe their butts, 
'cause they all have 
to go to the bathroom. 
And I feel good.
I'm going to go take a bath, 
so the whole tent 
 doesn't smell like ass 
by the end of the night. 
Mine wasn't that bad. 
Mine wasn't that bad, 
but I will... 
I will feel much better. 
I mean, I'm sitting here 
wiping my butt with leaves. 
You know, you can only get 
 so much with leaves, I'm sure. 
Whew. 
Boy, that felt good. 
Almost as good 
 as eating the cheeseburger. 
Time to get 
in the river. 
Make some ass clean. 
That's what I was just
 thinking about doing. 
ELISABETH: 
 Our systems were just 
 in shock, in absolute shock. 
Hopefully that's
 it for me. 
And as good as it was, 
 I mean, I would not take 
any of that away. 
I would... I would do it 
 all over again. 
I really would. 
Nothing can compare to the food.
My leaf had a hole in it, Keith.
( laughing ) 
( laughing continues ) 
( thunder rumbling, crashing ) 
( heavy rainfall ) 
TINA: 
 The water has risen 
 considerably from last night, 
and we're losing ground, 
and we had our flag on the other
 side of our tent, and... 
I had to move it because 
 we don't know how much longer 
there's going 
 to be beach over there. 
We could have been 
 washed away last night? 
TINA: 
 And we're probably going 
to have to move camp 
 today, actually. 
Today or tomorrow, no doubt. 
The water's risen, and it must 
 be flooding upstream because 
it's quickly encroaching on us. 
ELISABETH: 
 It might as well be 
 a minefield right now. 
I mean, with the... 
 with the weather 
how it is, a storm could come 
and just wash 
 our tent right out. 
It's right in line 
 with the riverbed 
where it seemed 
 to be rushing before 
and the river's already 
crept up and consumed 
 what we had at camp. 
I mean, we crossed 
 that river to get here. 
It's almost doubled in size. 
I mean, it's massive 
 right now, and it is 
coming for us. 
AMBER: 
 It just keeps on going.
Every day,
there's something new.
Unbelievable. 
I'm just in shock.
ELISABETH: 
 We're in trouble. 
We need to move this camp, 
 and, my gosh, if I feel 
how I did yesterday, 
if everyone feels 
how they did yesterday, 
 I can't even get myself 
out of first gear. 
You know, 
 you go from being starving 
and then going 
 to an auction and eating, 
to being starving again, 
and, you know, that one meal 
 isn't enough to sustain you. 
It's not. We're still depleted. 
It's just... it's going 
 to be a rough day, 
and we don't have food yet. 
NICK: 
 For me, uh, not having food 
 is-is a killer. 
The lack of energy 
 and the heat and the rain-- 
it's all real, and, uh, 
 tomorrow makes a month. 
And a month is a long time 
 to lay on the ground. 
I mean, I'm 23 years old, 
I'm in pretty good 
 athletic shape. 
My back is killing me. 
You know, I've been sick twice.
My mouth is raw. 
Yesterday, I felt a lot better 
 after I ate. 
You know, 
 I felt I could do this 
for 13 more days, but 
today, I'm just, like, 
 oh, God, 
please get me out of here 
 sometime soon. 
Good call, coach. 
RODGER: 
Ooh, he liked the hook, 
too, didn't he? 
That's a nice one. 
Look how fat he is. 
Oh, man. 
TINA: 
 Rodger's been out fishing. 
Elisabeth's been out fishing. 
I've been out fishing. 
Has Nick been out fishing? 
No. 
He was asked to go fishing, 
 but he said that 
he's never been before, 
and he wasn't planning 
 on starting now. 
ELISABETH: 
 Why, you know, 
let your friends work 
 extra hard 
because you don't want 
 to get up and move, 
because you don't feel 
 like moving? 
We're all sick here. 
I mean, 
 we're all weak, 
and I never thought 
 I'd say this, 
I really never thought I would,
 but I'm really 
disappointed in Nick right now. 
I really am. 
You know, 
 maybe we're the dumb ones. 
Maybe he is smart, 
 saving his energy 
and sleeping all day 
 to win immunity. 
If we're... 
 if Rodger and I are out there, 
you know, blowing all 
 of our energy on fishing, 
and Nick is conserving 
 his energy wisely, 
he's gonna keep winning 
 immunity challenges, 
and that's gonna leave a vote 
 to one-one of us, one... 
You know, either Rodger 
 or myself, and that's scary. 
That makes me mad. 
NICK: 
 I-I feel vulnerable 
because I still remain 
 a-a physical threat 
to win challenges. 
Um, I won the last 
 immunity challenge. 
I'm a big body, 
 so I take a lot to feed. 
So, I'm feeling vulnerable. 
Um, if I don't win 
 the immunity challenge, 
I definitely expect to go. 
I need to take the immunity 
 necklace back. 
There you go. 
Immunity back 
 up for grabs. 
All right, the ability 
 to start fire quickly-- 
essential to survival 
 in the outback. 
Whether it's just 
to signal a passing plane, 
or to create warmth, 
 fire skills got to be sharp. 
For today's
 challenge, 
you'll each be assigned 
 a fire scale. 
On one end, a fire bucket. 
On the other end, 
 a water bucket. 
Your goal-- create fire 
 in that fire bucket, 
and then by putting water 
 in the water bucket, 
tilt the scale 
 to raise the fire high enough 
to light a fuse at the top. 
First person 
to light the fuse wins immunity.
Here's the hiccup. 
Your water bucket has a hole 
 in it, 
so it's gonna be 
 a constant battle...
( laughter ) 
...running to the 
 river to gather water...
TINA: 
 Oh, my gosh. 
...and making sure 
your fire still has flame. 
( laughter ) 
Sound good?
Yeah. 
AMBER: 
It sounds good. 
They're all the same. 
 Pick one and let's go. 
AMBER: 
So there's always a catch. 
It's so funny.
( indistinct chatter ) 
JEFF: 
 Everybody knows 
where their matches are, right? 
Yeah. 
For immunity, 
survivors ready?
Go! 
? ? 
? ? 
Two people going 
 for water already. 
That-a-way, Rodger.
Keep cooking, Keith. 
Don't be deceived. 
You're making progress. 
Right now, we've got 
 a lot of fires burning. 
? ? 
Ladies and gents, 
 they're moving. 
JEFF: 
Hey, hey, hey. 
No, no, no. 
 Just checking balance. 
Okay. Don't check. 
I know you guys 
 are getting tired. 
Good news is your fires 
 are doing great. 
Not mine. 
JEFF: 
Except for you, Nick. 
Too late to stop now. 
Oh, come on, come on, come on. 
You're getting there, Keith. 
TINA: 
? There's a hole in the bucket ?
? Dear Liza. ? 
Let's bring home the pot. 
Come on. Come on. 
Come on, baby. 
 Come on, baby. 
Yeah. 
No. Stay there. No! 
No! 
JEFF: 
 You're close. Don't slow down. 
COLBY: 
Yeah! Whoa! Yeah! 
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! 
Right here, man-- 
 nice work. 
Out of nowhere.
Comin' from behind. 
RODGER: 
 Got to have something to eat 
 around here. 
Keeps everybody's spirits up 
 if we got a little something. 
TINA: 
 Nutritionally, you know, 
our body is going into shock. 
None of us are used 
 to being this weak 
and not knowing 
 really what to do about it. 
Um, I know Elisabeth 
 is not doing well at all. 
She had a very hard time 
 getting up this morning, 
just making it out of the tent 
 this morning. 
I'm really concerned about her.
Take a load off, 
get some water. 
I'm just going to 
 drink some water. 
( sniffles ) 
 I'm feeling terrible... 
 and I mean... 
But I'm just, like, 
shaking and weak, and... 
( sniffles ) 
( sighs ) 
I'm just frustrated 
 with how I feel. 
I couldn't even walk 
 up the hill to fish. 
I mean... 
I hate not being able 
 to help out and get some food. 
We need to get
 rice today. 
I just want my
 strength back.
( sniffles ): 
 I'm just nauseous and, like... 
Oh, man. 
NICK: 
It's hard to get started 
in the morning. 
Yeah. 
We have nothing to sustain us 
through the morning today. 
We're praying for fish. 
We have only two hooks 
 right now. 
No luck. 
Not even any bites. 
Rodger got a turtle. 
He pulled the hook off, 
so there goes another hook. 
I'm sorry I couldn't 
make it out here sooner. 
I just had a rough morning. 
RODGER: 
Why don't you 
come back and rest, 
and then... and then 
we're going to go back out 
in a couple hours. 
Okay. 
Only bite I had 
 was that stupid turtle. 
( sniffles ): 
 I'm just real low.
RODGER: 
 Yeah, Jeff's here.
He's got a big thing of rice. 
TINA: 
 He has a bad 
 look on his face. 
What's up, guys? 
RODGER: 
 Is that ours? 
I come today 
because I'm concerned, 
because yesterday 
at the immunity challenge, 
I saw something 
that I haven't 
seen before-- 
true lethargy, 
a real lack of energy, 
especially with Elisabeth 
and Nick. 
You've got 13 days left, 
and I don't think 
 you're going to make it. 
So it puts me 
in an awkward situation, 
because you had 
plenty of stuff. 
If rationed properly, 
 you had enough rice, 
and you had 25 hooks. 
You had a tackle box 
you couldn't improve on. 
So, what happened 
with the rice? 
I mean, why are you out? 
We just weren't
careful with our rations. 
There's not any 
 one person to blame-- 
 we're all guilty. 
We did each lose
 a bag, too, 
to condensation in the can. 
COLBY: 
But that's our own fault. 
Come on. 
I'm not saying 
 it's not our fault, 
but you just asked 
 what's happened, 
and that's part 
 of what happened. 
Here's where we're at. 
You know, 
my role is a giver and a taker. 
Nothing comes cheap. 
I have enough rice 
to last you 
your last two weeks here. 
AMBER: 
 There's so much
 rice there. 
But it's not coming 
without a price, 
so I need something back, 
 and I need something of value, 
substantial value, 
to get this rice. 
RODGER: 
The blankets. 
I think blankets would
 be a good tradeoff. 
Rodger, 
I'm talking serious value. 
You guys are playing for... 
 You're laying there 
 shivering some night, 
and those blankets 
 are of serious value. 
You're playing 
for one million dollars. 
TINA: 
 Of what we have, 
 what do you want? 
I'm talking camp. 
Camp? Our-our-our tent? 
Shelter versus food. 
 It's one or the other. 
Your tarps 
and that Texas flag. 
That's what I want. 
You want all the 
 tarps and the flag?
All the tarps? 
How are we going to 
 keep dry when it rains?
It rains every day. 
TINA: 
 Use rain jackets, 
 cover tops of trees.
COLBY: 
Yeah, I mean, 
shelter, though. 
I mean, that's a no-brainer, 
and I'm talking 
about my personal item here. 
I have no problem giving it up. 
JEFF: 
Let me entice you 
a little more: 
25 more hooks. 
TINA: 
 Oh, absolutely.
You can have the 
 shelter, as far as... 
My vote is take
 the shelter. 
And if we 
 have energy,
we can build something. 
Let's do it. 
TINA: 
 Thank you, Jeff.
Oh, my God.
Who's got the strength 
 to tear it down? 
I hate to have 
 you disrupt 
 everything, but...
We need our food, 
and we need 
 our strength. 
Got to have a value. 
Your tarps and that 
 big old Texas flag 
engineered 
 to be a tarp. 
Take care of that, 
please. 
I will. 
Good negotiation, guys.
Thank you very much.
 I hope the 
 food gives you
the strength to rebuild... 
It will. 
 ...to get through 
 the last two weeks.
Thank you. 
Thanks, Rodger.
All right, I'll see
 you guys tonight...
KEITH: 
All right, Jeff. 
...where we have 
 the unfortunate business 
of dealing 
 with the Tribal Council. 
So, eat up today. 
Bye, guys. 
KEITH: 
 Once we realized that, 
 "Oh, my God, 
our shelter's gone," 
the first thing we seem 
 to have to do is get 
a roof over our head, 
 'cause it really seemed 
like it was going to rain 
 pretty hard today. 
Yeah, it's going to be 
pouring down rain here tonight. 
Well, we need to start looking 
 for tree cover. 
Actually, up in this thing 
 would probably be the best, 
just 'cause there's so many 
places to lay branches in here. 
TINA: 
 The only downside is if 
 the river comes up again. 
I don't think we need 
to bring the woods to us; 
I think we need 
to go to the woods. 
Mm-hmm. 
KEITH: 
 So then it was trying to decide
where the shelter's 
 going to be. 
And we had a little food 
 this morning, but not enough 
to climb a hill and build 
a shelter up in the hills, 
that's for sure. 
RODGER: 
We want to come in 
here with some limbs 
or something and angle them down
so it'll run as much water off 
 as we can. 
TINA: 
 I think it was a fair trade 
 if we can keep the rains away, 
as long as it's not 
 a torrential downpour. 
We may get wet, 
but there's worse things in life
 than being wet, 
such as starving to death. 
COLBY: 
 Hey, Nick, can you 
 bring some of that brush down? 
TINA: 
Think chopping up 
this chest is good? 
We're using everything that 
 we possibly can at this point. 
Every little bit helps. 
RODGER: 
 I got some more. 
All right. 
What do you need 
 most of right now? 
We got grass. 
I need grass and pine-- 
 that's it. 
It's looking solid already. 
TINA: 
 Maybe it won't 
 even rain tonight.
COLBY: 
 Maybe not.
( thunder rumbling ) 
TINA: 
 Maybe so. 
I feel 
 a couple of raindrops. 
TINA: 
 Might as well 
 get used to it.
These branches aren't going 
to keep us totally dry. 
It's going to be 
more water-resistant 
 than waterproof. 
RODGER: 
 At least we got food, brother. 
COLBY: 
 Amber's a little bit nervous 
about the fact 
 that we voted Jerri off. 
She felt like she might be 
the next one that we go after. 
That way, 
Amber won't know anything. 
That's a smart move. 
COLBY: 
 It could be 
 potentially deadly 
for all three of us. 
Can you help me carry this? 
COLBY: 
 She and Elisabeth 
 have been bonding quite well. 
She could very easily go over 
 to the guys from Kucha and say,
"Hey, look, I know 
 they're going after me next. 
I want to jump on 
 with you guys." 
ELISABETH: 
 If I were Amber, 
 I'd feel threatened. 
I mean, if everyone 
 can make Jerri go away, 
she can just as easily go away.
But by voting Jerri off, 
 Ogakor diluted 
their power a bit. 
It didn't seem 
 to be the smartest 
strategic thing to do. 
Okay, guys. 
Amber, take yours.
ELISABETH: 
 And, now, 
 I think they are worried 
about Amber approaching us. 
Amber is kind of a pivot 
in the whole 
 Barramundi scenario. 
Bon app?tit. 
That is good rice. 
It's so nice 
to have rice again. 
AMBER: 
 I could approach 
 the Kucha people and go 
against Colby, Tina and Keith, 
 and it would be four 
against three, and we could 
 just pick them off one by one. 
But how do I know that I can 
 100% trust the Kucha members, 
that they're not just playing 
with my mind and just 
 pretending to agree with me? 
I guess I don't know if I 
 can trust Ogakor people, too. 
They could be playing 
with my mind too, 
 but I have to play the game. 
And the game's getting harder 
 and harder as the days go on. 
RODGER: 
 We need to be 
 heading out. 
I guess we're ready.
Let's go. 
RODGER: 
 You're not bringing
 anything, Keith? 
We'll now bring in our jury-- 
Alicia and Jerri. 
I'll remind you 
that the jury's 
not to be addressed. 
They won't address you. 
They're merely here 
 to gather information 
to help them determine 
who's going 
to get the million dollars 
and the title of Survivor. 
Okay, first things first. 
What was the reaction 
after I left 
with all your tarps 
and your Texas flag 
but you guys 
had food? 
Tina, did you feel 
the negotiation was fair? 
I definitely feel 
 like it was fair. 
That was something 
 that we could rebuild.
And even though
you took it away from us, 
it's not like 
 it couldn't be replaced. 
And so, 
to be quite honest, 
I was grateful 
 that that's what you chose. 
Nick, obviously, you came 
into this a very fit guy. 
Are you surprised 
at the toll 
it's taken on your body? 
I'm definitely surprised. 
I mean, I stood up today, 
and I felt like I was 
really going to pass out. 
I was waving back and forth 
 and felt bad. 
And the last 
three days 
have been so incredibly tough. 
Direct question, Colby. 
Anybody here 
not pulling 
their weight? 
No. 
I don't think so. 
 Rodger? 
Overall, 
I think it's... 
everybody's been pulling 
 their weight. 
JEFF: 
Amber, how have you grown 
as a person, 
being out here 28 days now? 
I am a lot more open 
than I ever thought I would be, 
and I'm willing to try 
 new things and do new things. 
And I'm 
a much riskier person now. 
It might have taken 
a really hard experience 
to learn that 
about myself, 
but I think 
it's definitely worth it. 
I want you guys 
 to just take a second 
and look 
at Alicia and Jerri. 
Slowly, 
the power base 
shifts 
from this side 
to that side. 
In the end, 
it comes down to politics. 
How can you possibly 
 vote somebody out 
and get their vote 
at the end? 
I just want to remind you 
 of that as we go vote. 
Elisabeth, you're up. 
My vote is for Keith tonight, 
because, unlike everybody else,
he didn't feel the need 
 to bring his backpack, 
and, uh, that's 
 just flat-out arrogance. 
You seem like 
a really great guy, 
but you said you were tired 
 of playing the game, 
and that you weren't 
 having fun anymore. 
So, here's your ticket, buddy. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
I'll read the votes. 
The first vote... 
Nick. 
Amber. 
Keith. 
Amber. 
Two votes, Amber. 
Nick. 
Two votes, Nick, 
two votes, Amber, 
one vote, Keith. 
That's three votes, Nick. 
Last vote... 
Nick. 
You need to bring me 
your torch. 
You guys play tough.
See you, buddy. 
 Bye, Nick. 
Hang in there; 
hang in there. 
I hope it doesn't rain tonight. 
Nick, the tribe has spoken. 
TINA: 
 Bye, Nick.
JEFF: 
For the rest 
of you guys, 
I wish for you dry, 
hot weather with no rain. 
You can head back to camp. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode, 
and hear what Nick has to say. 
Next time on Survivor: 
This game, 
 in the past three days, 
has become drastically primal. 
JEFF: 
 Has Barramundi 
 been pushed to the brink, 
or is their greatest challenge 
 yet to come? 
Oh, my God. 
Our camp is called 
 a dry creek bed. 
I doubt if it's dry right now. 
It's been a great adventure, 
had some great times 
 and some big lows. 
The last few days have 
 been really rough on me, 
and it's taught me a lot 
 about not only my strengths 
but more importantly, 
 my weaknesses. 
I kind of feel invincible 
 at times, 
and Survivor has been 
 a big reality check for me. 
It's been a ride; 
 it's definitely been a ride.
