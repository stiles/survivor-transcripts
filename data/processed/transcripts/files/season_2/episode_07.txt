         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Three days before the merge, 
Kucha had a one-member 
 advantage over Ogakor. 
It's a huge advantage, 
 because the pressure 
is on them to win 
 the next challenge. 
Go! 
And it looked 
 like they might regain 
their winning streak 
 when Nick led them to victory 
in the reward challenge. 
Kucha! 
JEFF V.: 
 We are a very cocky group. 








It's fun to have them talk 
about how hungry they are, 
and us go in there 
 and win all their food. 
JEFF: 
 Ogakor couldn't hide 
 their frustration. 
JERRI: 
 The other tribe will 
 probably just pick us off 
one by one. 
JEFF: 
 But before the immunity 
 challenge could take place, 
( Michael screams ) 
...the game 
 took a violent twist. 
Michael passed out in the fire,
 and was severely burned. 
( groaning ) 
MICHAEL: 
Kucha, you guys know what to do.
JERRI: 
 "There has been an 
 accident at the Kucha camp, 
and one of their members has 
 been evacuated." 
JEFF: 
 Michael's evacuation 
 leaves Kucha and Ogakor even, 








with five members each. 
Tonight, 
 will new strategies 
and new friendships be born 
 as the two tribes 
merge into one? 
Who will be the first person 
 voted out of the new tribe? 
ALICIA: 
 They've been handed a gift. 
ELISABETH: 
 They are going into this 
 with an advantage, 
because we were supposed to be 
 one up on them, anyway. 
ALICIA: 
They were about to be voted off 
 one by one, and they know it. 
JEFF V.: 
 For the last three weeks, 
we've been competing 
 with another tribe. 
At this point, we get down 
 to ten total people, 
and we come together 
and merge into one tribe. 
ELISABETH: 
It blows my mind 
to even picture feeling 
any sort of loyalty toward... 
I don't even know them. 
We have been through 
so much together. 
JEFF V.: 
 We've talked about 
 strategy and how we were going 
to merge with this other team 
 ever since Mike got hurt, 
because the last thing 
 that he said to us, 
as he left, was that 
 somebody from Kucha 
needs to take this money. 
And regardless of what happens, 
we need to eat 'em up 
 and spit 'em out. 
This is going 
to have to get ugly 
if we really want 
this thing to work. 
The first vote,
 we have to do 
something to get
 an advantage. 
RODGER: 
 That's right. 
NICK: 
 It's going to depend
 on that first vote, 
and it's smooth 
 sailing from there.
You hit the nail 
 on the head, son. 
ELISABETH: 
If I had to vote right now, 
I'd vote Colby, 
and I'd vote Jerri next. 
ALICIA: 
It's got to be Jerri 
and Colby first. 
My instinct says 
Tina was the guiding force. 
When I was standing in that 
number one circle and I was 
quizzing her, 
and the way she was 
 answering my questions
just told me that she 
was putting on a face 
and was a shrewd woman. 
JEFF V.: 
 We were just trying 
 to figure out who probably is 
Ogakor's weak link, 
and maybe we 
 can convince them to come over 
and vote on our side. 
Tina will not turn on 
 her team. 
JEFF V.: 
 No, I know Tina
 won't turn. 
There's no way. 
Most likely 
 to turn is Keith. 
I think 
Keith and Amber. 
ALICIA: 
I just think Nick and 
I are going to have to be ready 
for anything 'cause he 
and I are going 
to be the first ones up. 
KIMMI: 
See, I think they'll 
be gunnin' for me. 
JEFF V.: 
Listen to you all talking. 
It's me. 
Plus, Kimmi on the second, 
the first reward challenge. 
They asked who Debb voted for, 
and Kimmi said Jeff, 
so they know that I have 
 a vote against me. 
We're anticipating a five- 
 to-five tie in the first vote. 
And in the rules, 
 when there's a deadlock tie, 
the person with the most votes 
accumulated to that point 
is the one to leave. 
NICK: 
You think they remembered, Jeff?
Because I had totally forgotten 
 about that. 
JEFF V.: 
 It's never left my mind. 
If they remember that...
But then again, 
that's a vote against me, 
so it wouldn't leave my mind. 
( laughter ) 
ELISABETH: 
What happens then? 
NICK: 
 I would be, like, 
 forget about it. 
COLBY: 
 Yesterday, everything 
 was canceled because 
of the accident with Kucha. 
You know, you're just left 
with days that seem like 
there's at least 19 to 20 hours
 of daylight. 
We have no idea 
 what's going on, 
and we have no idea 
 how drastic or serious 
the situation is with Kucha. 
I hope whoever it is 
 is able to return. 
COLBY: 
 Automatically, we assume 
 the worst... horrible. 
It's the worst part about this 
is waiting around 
 for information. 
It's like getting a phone call 
 from the hospital, 
saying, "Oh, we've got him here,
but can't tell you 
 what's wrong." 
You don't think Rodger 
 had a stroke or anything? 
( gasps ) 
Oh, my gosh, Jerri. 
Yeah. 
COLBY: 
 We don't know anything. 
We don't know 
 when we're merging, 
we don't know 
 the condition 
of Kucha's member 
who's been in an accident. 
We don't know very much at all. 
"Boys night out." 
COLBY: 
 Well? 
It's different.
"You've wondered for weeks 
'What's their camp like?' 
"So, here's your big chance. 
Send your scouts for the hike. 
"The men will go visit 
while the women remain. 
"Cook a big dinner, 
there'll be guests 
to entertain." 
So, we'll stay here and the guys
 are going to come to our camp, 
we'll cook dinner for them, 
they're going to cook 
 for you guys. 
Cool. So we get to go 
 on a hike down thataway. 
I'm all over that. 
 Yeah! 
Finally get out 
 and do something. 
I better iron a shirt!
( laughing ) 
Big night out on the town, 
 brother. 
Big night, you know? 
 You know what 
 I'm saying? 
...go into town. 
Life is good. Life is good. 
 Life is good right 
 here, brother. 
KEITH: 
 The merge is when 
 the two teams 
come together 
 to make one team, 
and the game becomes 
one against one, 
 instead of team against team. 
COLBY: 
 Tina, you going to catch 
 the kids some fish tonight? 
I hope. 
TINA: 
 You go to one camp 
 or the other, 
and I'm not sure 
 how that decision 
is going to be made 
 at this point. 
We'll get 
a real great take 
on the guys 
in their tribe, 
and where things lie. 
TINA: 
 It's important for us 
to get information right now 
about who's had votes cast 
 against them, 
because it's probably going 
 to come down 
to a tie-breaker vote. 
We've got to be 
 totally silent 
on who's had any votes. 
Yes, we do have 
 a lot at stake 
if we slip anything out 
regarding the voting situation--
 we're done. 
The only thing to break the tie
is past votes for the person 
 who is voted for. 
If they were to vote for myself
 or Keith... 
we'd be out. 
ELISABETH: 
 Hey, fellas, 
are you guys ready to hear this?
We got mail. 
"Girls' night out. 
You've wondered for weeks 
'What's their camp like?' 
"So here's your big chance. 
"Send your scouts for the hike. 
"The women will go visit, 
while the fellas remain. 
"Cook a big dinner, 
there'll be guests 
to entertain." 
JEFF V.: 
So you guys 
are going over there, 
and those girls 
are coming over here. 
They're keeping 
 the chicks apart. 
They're going to send 
 their chicks here. 
Oh, that's sneaky. 
ELISABETH: 
 That is very sneaky. 
ALICIA: 
 That is very sneaky.
This is how 
 it's going to start-- 
separate the boys 
 and the girls. 
JEFF V.: 
 We knew that the merger 
 was going to start today. 
We just weren't sure 
 exactly how. 
So, we got this note, 
and our girls are going 
 to them, 
and their chicks 
 are coming to us, 
and we're entertaining them 
 and swooning them 
and somehow convincing them 
that this is the place to live--
 Kucha Beach. 
ALICIA: 
 We know we don't want 
 to go over there, 
so they better really 
 pull out all the stops. 
NICK: 
 I think we have 
 a really nice camp, 
and nobody really wants 
 to move 
to a new place, you know, 
where everything's 
 real strange. 
And it would, 
 you know, kind of 
be our home field, 
 our home-turf advantage. 
JEFF V.: 
 If we're responsible 
 for the dinner, 
then those girls are eating 
 much better than y'all are. 
ALICIA: 
Wait a minute. 
You don't eat 
 that chicken. 
Wait. Time out.
We'll let y'all know how it was.
ALICIA: 
Women will go visit. 
Can we have the 
 Mountain Dew at least?
MEN: 
 No! 
You're going there. 
You have two cans left? 
We have to bring a 
 housewarming gift. 
We're not turning 
on you. 
Nobody's turning on nobody. 
I say we eat our own stuff. 
We got the majority 
 of them over here. 
NICK: 
 There's more of them to woo. 
We need to woo them. 
Woo-woo-woo, "woo them"? 
You know what? 
I don't like you
 guys anymore. 
ELISABETH: 
 This is why they 
 did this to us. 
As much as it stinks 
 that Alicia 
and I aren't going to get 
 to join in our last chicken, 
we know that it's for 
the betterment 
 of the whole group 
to leave and go eat 
plain rice with Keith and Colby.
He's supposedly
 a chef. 
I don't know 
how much 
he can do with 
white rice, and... 
We're going 
to miss our Kucha spices. 
Yeah, we had 
 a lot of good stuff
going on in our camp. 
Those girls are going 
 to be well-taken care of. 
Living large. 
Whoo! 
ALICIA: 
 Elisabeth and I felt 
 really strange 
walking away from camp, 
 just us two. 
It was really kind of cool, 
an adventure that's going 
 to change this game. 
It's a big open book, 
 and we got to write 
the rest of the pages 
 that go in it. 
COLBY: 
 I'm very curious 
as to how they've been living 
 the last 19 days. 
With their shelter, 
 with their eating, you know, 
there's a lot of things 
 I want to know to see 
if that's where we want to be. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm excited. 
 I know. 
I'm so curious to see 
what their camp is like. 
Well, that's
 the thing. 
And how they set 
it up for us. 
Fe, fi, fo, fum! 
I smell the blood 
 of a Kucha tribe! 
What's up? 
JERRI:
 Hey! 
Hi. 
( laughs ) 
What's up? 
You know how funny this is?
The guys are expecting 
you guys right now. 
( laughter ) 
We had all this laying out 
the tablecloth. 
JERRI: 
 Oh, my God! 
 Tablecloth, napkins.
It said 
"Boys Night Out." 
They're so ready. 
 They're going to die 
when they see your guys. 
We've been 
 so worried.
They didn't even tell 
 you guys what happened? 
No, not a word. 
What did your note say? 
Somebody got hurt 
 and they were not 
 going to be returning.
And they've been 
evacuated out. 
Sit down for this one.
ALICIA: 
Yeah, this is a, 
it's a big deal. 
ELISABETH: 
 It was good to hear 
 that they were worried 
and hoping everything 
and praying everything was okay 
 with Mike. 
He apparently just
 hyperventilated 
 and passed out. 
And all of a sudden, 
I see him 
down and he was 
face-first 
 into the fire.
His hands were burned off. 
When his hands were
 in the water, 
the skin was floating up
 above his hand. 
ELISABETH: 
They were just red. 
They put a helicopter 
 right on our beach 
and took him away.
Have you heard any news
 on him at all? 
Yeah, he's going 
to be okay. 
Glad to know it's not 
 one of those things 
that's life-threatening. 
I felt a lot of relief. 
ALICIA: 
 We were crying,
 we were a mess.
It was really sad.
ELISABETH: 
It was very difficult. 
JERRI: 
 When we first found out 
 yesterday that we were 
merging with all five of us, 
after the accident 
 over at Kucha... 
we didn't really know 
whether to celebrate 
 or feel bad. 
Whatever takes you
 out of the game 
takes you out 
 of the game. 
Whether it's a snakebite
 or the fire, 
it was part of the game. 
And he is 
the sixth person
 to leave. 
TINA: 
 The importance at this point 
 in at five and five, 
had a huge impact 
 on the Ogakor tribes. 
If we had gone in 
 at six and four, 
we would have been 
 picked off one by one, 
no doubt about it. 
We're starting off 
 the second half of the game 
on equal ground. 
It's a tie ball game, 
we're going into overtime. 
COLBY: 
 We got to be getting close. 
Look at this. 
Anybody home? 
Knock-knock. 
Hola.
What? 
 What's up, 
 fellows? 
Wait a minute. 
What are you
 guys doing? 
Well, we took 
a little trip down the,
 down the beach. 
What's up? 
 Hi, man.
( all talking at once ) 
How you doing, man? 
Good. 
So, your note said 
what? "Boys Night Out"? 
COLBY: 
"Boys Night Out." 
JEFF V.: 
Ours said "Girls 
Night Out." 
NICK: 
 Ours said "Girls Night Out." 
We were expecting 
 the women over here.
Rodger, I'm real sorry, bro. 
I didn't even bring 
 a skirt with me, so I can't 
do anything 
for you, man. 
COLBY: 
 When Keith and I showed up, 
they couldn't have been 
 more disappointed. 
They were ready to wine and dine
 the women of Ogakor, 
and Keith and I 
 come strolling in. 
Look, you guys 
already had 
the table set 
and everything. 
Y'all really were 
expecting the girls. 
( all talking and laughing ) 
KEITH: 
 Colby and I 
 were actually kinda 
hoping it was going 
 to be kinda 
the girls cooking for the guys,
but we had a good time, 
great camaraderie, 
 it was kind of 
like soldiers in the field that 
are putting their 
weapons down for a little while.
COLBY: 
Well, now, you guys called this 
 "Camp Carnage," but it looks 
like you guys are living 
 pretty plush around here. 
Our girls, when 
 they sent us off, 
they're like, "Man,
"y'all check 
 out that camp.
"If it's smelling and 
 there's flies everywhere, 
I don't want to 
 move over there." 
JEFF V.: 
 All I saw from Colby 
 were teeth-- big smile, 
"How's it going?" Whatever. 
He just seemed 
 very cheery and very happy, 
and Keith seemed like a little 
puppy tailing behind him. 
We saved a 
 chicken for you.
Are you serious? 
Yeah, we're going to 
 have chicken tonight. 
No way. 
You guys are too much. 
We got spices, too.
We can roast it 
in paper bark. 
Wrap that whole 
thing in there, 
put the spices on 
and slow roast that. 
KEITH: 
 They saved a chicken for us. 
They killed their last chicken 
and cooked it, which just, 
which was just a real 
 gentleman thing to do for us. 
JEFF V.: 
 You know, there's a 
 Survivor twist to everything, 
and they got us again. 
I was expecting women, 
you know. We were going 
to lather them up 
and go pick them flowers, 
and now we're going 
to have to shift gears. 
( both laughing ) 
They're nice, you know? 
They're nice guys. 
I knew they would be, 
 but I get the feeling 
that Keith is an outsider. 
So far, they're exactly 
 what I expected. 
They seem to have a good 
 relationship together, 
which I didn't expect. I figured
that, um, Keith would sort 
 of be off on his own, 
and he could be, you know? 
They may be 
 working us here, but... 
Just pick one up, 
 take a bite, pass it. 
COLBY: 
 I didn't think I'd see 
 chicken cross these lips 
for 24 days.
That lemon pepper 
is the bomb. 
JEFF V.: 
 It was good chicken, 
 and it was good 
to be able 
 to provide them with chicken, 
'cause they obviously 
 had not been eating. 
Colby, what do you want me 
to do with this bone, man? 
There's still 
stuff on there. 
I don't like the 
 way we're passing.
Can we change 
 the passing around?
Can we go 
the other way? 
That was a huge thing for us. 
We really enjoyed that a lot. 
You know, 
I think as the days go on, 
this game is going 
 to be difficult. 
It is for me 
 personally exciting. 
I get caught up in the 
 friendship thing quite easily. 
Even though the meat
 was a little tough, 
that was still 
 a good chicken.
Yeah. 
It was an 
excellent chicken. 
RODGER: 
 I know everybody 
 is nicey-nicey now, 
but I imagine that'll change. 
I think it'll be even more 
 interesting once all ten of us,
with the women and everybody, 
 is in the big hut. 
There'll be 
 some times, I'm sure, 
when things won't be 
 so nice around here. 
ELISABETH: 
 You need some help? 
JERRI: 
I think I'll be all right. 
I'm just trying to cover this, 
'cause you know 
 what I just realized? 
Our only matches
are in Keith's pocket. 
ALICIA: 
Uh-oh. 
Yeah, "uh-oh" is right. 
So, I'm thinking we 
should probably cook 
everything because 
Keith has the matches. 
ALICIA: 
Are you sure he has them? 
JERRI: 
I know he does. 
ALICIA: 
He's probably 
laughing right now, 
going, "Guess what?
It's raining 
 and I got the matches." 
JERRI: 
 He doesn't 
 realize it, I'm sure. 
ALICIA: 
Oh, man. 
JERRI: 
 I don't want to talk 
about Keith 
 in front of our guests. 
Smell that. 
JERRI: 
 If I voice my opinions 
about how I really 
 feel about him, 
they're going 
 to figure out that votes 
have been placed against him. 
He should not be 
in charge of the matches. 
Could have potentially now been 
an issue where we couldn't eat. 
TINA: 
 I don't think it was 
 a deliberate thing 
where he said, "I'm going 
to take my matches with me 
so the girls won't have it." 
He would not do that 
 under any circumstances. 
It's in Jerri's 
 best interest not to show 
a real hateful side. 
Jerri's a good chick. 
Normally, it looks a lot better 
 than it is right now. 
We're going home. 
( laughter ) 
We decided that 
 I was going to make 
my famous tortilla, 
 and we opened a can 
of whole, peeled tomatoes. 
ALICIA: 
 We just want to tell 
 you guys that your guys 
are getting 
chicken right now. 
Oh! 
Like, there's no way 
they saved any for us. 
They're getting 
chicken right now. 
AMBER: 
 I'm sorry we don't 
 have any chicken. 
ALICIA: 
That's okay. 
AMBER: 
 This is definitely 
difficult for us. 
 I mean, we wish 
we had so much 
 more to offer them. 
It's upsetting 
 that we can't give them 
as much 
 as they can give us. 
Wow, that looks 
 amazing, though. 
Give me, like, some ingredients 
 that I can get creative with. 
ALICIA: 
 When you don't have 
 a lot of food 
and you open up a can, 
that's like... that's big-time. 
So, we were really honored 
 that they did that. 
Watch, it's hot. 
Okay. 
ALICIA: 
 I feel like 
 I can't wait to get them 
back to our camp 
 to give them something to eat, 
you know, and I never thought 
that I would feel that way. 
I really thought I would 
be thinking, "I'm not 
 sharing anything with them." 
I don't eat meat, I don't 
eat pork, and I'm, like, 
craving a hot dog 
 and a hamburger. 
I could care less right now. 
Do you know 
 what I'm saying?
I would love a hot dog. 
( laughing ) 
Hello. I don't care.
Out of 20 hours of being here, 
we've talked about food 
 19 of those 20. 
So, what's your 
favorite kind of food? 
Hot fudge. 
TINA: 
How about Dove chocolate? 
ALL: 
 Oh... 
We're torturing ourselves. 
We are absolutely 
 torturing ourselves. 
ALICIA: 
 Have you ever had 
 different-flavor Tootsie Rolls,
like cherry Tootsie Rolls 
and vanilla 
 Tootsie Rolls? 
 Yes. 
Vanilla? 
ALICIA: 
They are yummy. 
JERRI: 
 When did they come out 
 with vanilla Tootsie Rolls? 
AMBER: 
I asked Alicia about their 
firewood situation.
 She said they 
have so, so much, 
they don't worry about
 the firewood at all. 
They have a kitchen. 
They have all 
these wonderful things. 
We have nothing. 
I agree. I'm 
 totally for going.
I am so stoked 
about going to their camp. 
We've got mail! 
( whooping )
Is there chocolate in it? 
No, ma'am. 
Is there 
 peanut butter 
in that mailbox? 
I don't know if I 
 should stand or sit.
 I'm so anxious. 
TINA: 
 "Once you were enemies 
"but now you'll be one. 
"You have just 15 minutes 
"to get all your work done. 
"Hike back to the croc swim. 
"The map shows you the way. 
Take all that you can, 
 but the canoe's got to stay." 
Oh! My God. 
All in the black bag, you guys. 
TINA: 
 We're moving! 
JERRI: 
 We were ready 
to pack up 
 and move to Camp Kucha. 
Roll up the flag inside.
The other black glove? 
AMBER: 
 Do we need our fishing poles? 
When we looked at the map, 
it was a completely 
 different spot. 
AMBER: 
 Maybe they're doing 
 the same thing, 
and we're going to 
have a whole new camp. 
I thought about that. 
Yup, I think that's what it is. 
JERRI: 
 A spot that was 
untouched, where we 
 would have to build 
everything again from scratch. 
NICK: 
 "Hike back to the croc swim. 
 The map shows the way. 
Take all that you can, 
 but the canoe's got to stay." 
JEFF V.: 
It's a good 
two-hour walk. 
Damn it. 
Make sure you bring 
your matches. 
Mine are... 
I got my matches. 
Nothing's ever 
 easy around here. 
RODGER: 
 We were a little... 
a little angry about it. 
Six minutes. 
KEITH: 
I was really frustrated with it.
I just didn't 
 want to leave there. 
Just, you know, we were there, 
 we were comfortable. 
I was liking that Kucha corn. 
I'm liking our camp. 
Yeah, I was liking 
 y'all's camp, too. 
It was a real pain. 
Let's go. 
ELIZABETH: 
 I see camp!
I see it, I see it! 
Are you serious?
( women cheering and ululating )
ELISABETH: 
 We missed you guys! 
Hey, baby.
How are you? 
AMBER: 
Guys, check this out! 
Look! 
 Where? 
Oh, my God!
( cheering ) 
They're doing 
 all the work. 
I'm glad. 
AMBER: 
 You ready, guys? 
I'm thinking there 
 might be food in here.
ALL: 
 Oh! 
It looks like a
 little picnic. 
( all talking at once ) 
ALICIA:
 Okay. 
"Building a new home 
 is now up to you, 
"but before you get started, 
you have two things to do. 
"A flag must be made 
 once your tribe's named. 
"Here's a toast to your efforts,
and the second half 
 of the game!" 
Oh, my God, oh, my God. 
( all talking and laughing ) 
ALICIA: 
 One, two, three. 
Wow. 
We get to make
 a new flag. 
( all squealing and cheering )
NICK: 
 We opened the box, 
and people just start 
 diving their hands in, 
which pissed me off, because I'm
thinking let's at least 
make sure 
 we're getting equal amounts, 
but Jerri and Amber 
 and Elisabeth and Alicia 
just start 
 yapping and screaming, 
and I was like, 
 oh, I had to back up. 
If I could have asked 
for anything, 
it would be 
fruit and cheese. 
Oh, cheese, 
cheese, cheese. 
TINA: 
 I've never had wine 
in my life... 
 Never. 
and I'm fixin' 
to have some. 
( laughter ) 
I may get drunk. 
Hey, guys, here's 
a tablecloth. 
This is a party! 
I swear, I haven't been that 
 excited since I was little, 
and so just 
 completely overwhelmed 
with the fact that you've 
been starving and the fact 
that you're in the middle 
of nowhere, and there's 
this spread in front of you. 
You are beautiful! 
ALL: 
 Yay! 
( cheering ) 
TINA: 
 It's nice, starting 
 all over, starting 
on equal ground, 
 and it was important 
to listen more than you talk, 
find out what you're up against.
Oh, you guys, 
 this is so great! 
ALICIA: 
You know, it was really kind of 
interesting, 
 because in the middle 
of all this celebrating, 
 this game 
is still being played, 
every minute of every day. 
My stomach's going,
 "What is going on?"
I have a little bit 
 of shock 
happening right now.
 JEFF V.: 
 They seemed 
to be very nice, and I thought 
 that it was all legitimate, 
and then I saw Colby 
and Jerri sort of sneak off 
 and whispering, 
and then I saw Colby 
 walk over to Keith, and then 
they start whispering, 
 and they're, like, 
pointing at us 
 and counting fingers, 
like, "She's going to go 
 first," and "He's 
going to go second," 
 and it started. 
We weren't together 
 15 minutes, and it started. 
( crickets chirping ) 
RODGER: 
 Thank God 
 it's not raining. 
We need to get something 
 up over our heads here 
in case it rains tonight. 
Like, what's the purpose
 of putting it up here? 
Like, the trees, the structure? 
RODGER: 
 Have the trees and 
 the shade and the...
JERRI: 
You know what? 
I'll just express 
my opinion right now. 
I think... on the beach 
 right there... 
Wow. 
in the shade. 
Let's go down there 
 and take a look. 
All right, let's look. 
Yay! 
( all talking at once ) 
COLBY: 
 Sometimes you run into 
 a situation 
where there's too many chiefs 
 and not enough Indians, so 
I'm just going to stand back. 
 I don't want 
to ruffle any feathers 
 at this point. 
You don't think that 
if it rains, 
it will rain down 
 this thing, do you?
That was one of my thoughts. 
That was one 
of my thoughts, too. 
But we're on this high thing. 
And if it runs down, it'll run 
down over there, won't it? 
RODGER: 
It's called 
a dry creek bed. 
I don't know if it's always 
dry or not, that's the question.
My idea was to originally build
 the, uh, hut up in the trees 
where you got 
 some good anchors, 
and then the girls said 
they would like to stay 
 down on the sand 
'cause it sleeps better. 
Go down with it a little bit. 
ALICIA: 
 Hey, Jer? 
JERRI: 
 Yeah. 
What was that little 
 big fish-- what was that? 
Oh, yeah! 
 That would be 
 a perfect name.
What is that? 
Barramundi. 
Barramundi. 
 Barramundi? 
 It means, like,
if you catch this fish, 
 you'll be eating for days.
JERRI: 
 We're called 
 the Barramundi tribe. 
It's a great name 
 for our new tribe, 
'cause this is when things get 
slippery and sneaky, 
and it's hard to catch people. 
It's the catch of the day. 
 We're quite a catch. 
KEITH: 
 You know, the honeymoon stage 
is going to end quickly. 
We're going to have to go into 
 an immunity challenge, 
and it's going to be obvious 
 that we're kind of two teams 
living as one tribe. 
Welcome. 
I will take the immunity idol. 
Barramundi: new tribe name. 
New tribe, new game. 
No longer playing 
 for tribal immunity, 
playing for individual immunity.
This is what you covet. 
Wear this, you're immune 
 from Tribal Council. 
You cannot be voted out. 
Today's challenge, 
 it's called "The Perch." 
There are ten wooden pillars 
 to stand on, 
one for each of you. 
I'm going to warn you-- 
this could be a long one. 
This challenge tests both 
your will and endurance. 
Last one standing wins this, 
is immune from the vote tonight.
Keep your eye on the talisman! 
Immunity at stake. 
Survivors, ready? 
Go! 
Anybody want to look up 
 at the sky 
to see if the sun 
 might peek out? 
I'm afraid to look. 
Rodger's, like, 
 "I'm not looking." 
I am fixed on the woods 
 up there, son. 
I don't look down at the water. 
( laughter ) 
If I did, I'd be a goner. 
I'm going to try to 
 alphabetize the 50 states.
Well, that... 
Isn't there a song? 
Arkansas. 
Alabama. 
Boy, things sure have 
 gotten fun out here. 
( laughter ) 
You guys, have a good game. 
All right. 
Bye, baby.
Bye. 
 Bye, Nick.
RODGER: 
Just don't get 
too close to me, Nick, 
'cause I'm liable to be next. 
NICK: 
 I've been sick 
 the last couple days, 
and I got up there, 
 felt a little dizzy, 
knew I wasn't going to win 
 and jumped off, 
and got a good hour of rest. 
So that made 
 much more sense to me 
than standing up on that block 
 and getting tired. 
I'll jump in right now... 
Like, if it makes you 
 feel better. 
Colby, you're jumping? 
Check on Nick for us. 
Oh, he did a flip! 
( applause ) 
 And it... 
I like the flip. 
This game's gonna 
 go forever. 
It is gonna go forever. 
My strategy was 
to make the Kucha guys mad, 
to convince them that 
 I'm the man to vote for. 
If I can draw some attention 
 away from Keith and Jerri, 
who both have several votes 
 for them, 
we really need one of 
 those guys to win immunity 
and the other one 
 to be camouflaged. 
Because if the Kucha members 
vote for either Jerri or Keith, 
we're going down. 
It's not even bothering 
some of those guys out there. 
It was killing me. 
Yeah. 
I feel so good! 
Uh-oh, Jeff's bringing 
something out, guys. 
ELISABETH: 
Is that an ice cream 
cone on there? 
No, that's peanut butter. 
It's not peanut butter now. 
 Both you guys, shut up. 
That's peanut 
butter. 
It's not. 
 Is it Skippy? 
Hey, guys. 
I have a little peanut butter, 
 chocolate... 
( screams ): 
 Oh! Chocolate. 
The first person off 
gets it? 
So what are you 
saying exactly? 
Who gets it? 
Colby...! 
That's a great idea. 
Colby? 
Yeah. 
 Nick, come here.
ALL ( screaming ): 
 No! 
( yelling ) 
That's not right. 
This is why you 
 keep your mouth shut. 
My mom says, "Elisabeth, 
 keep your mouth shut!" 
Do I listen? No! 
He's getting a big old dip, 
 Elisabeth. 
That's pure peanut butter 
 right there. 
Anybody decides to bail, 
 you can join me. 
This is torture!
I was just waiting for you 
 to say those words. 
You can get a big scoop. 
That's not enough. 
No, that's not
 enough, Jeff. 
That's not enough, Jeff. 
 Forget it. 
Okay. 
It's plenty for Rodger. 
It ain't very good. 
Stick it out. 
COLBY: 
That one bite 
of peanut butter 
was better than 
any of the wine 
and cheese and crackers... 
Damn it! Shut up. 
Come on over to 
the dark side, Jeff. 
If you don't think you 
can out-stand us, 
then I would go 'cause 
you're not gonna get that later.
Not if y'all are gonna 
 vote me off, though. 
Now, see, you hear 
that, Jeff? 
What? 
Look at these women, 
they're bound and 
determined to win this. 
Oh! 
COLBY: 
Oh, my God! 
( chuckling ) 
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Elisabeth... 
ELISABETH: 
 Is it good?
No more takers?
Okay. Four hours. 
See you guys 
in another couple. 
What you got there, buddy? 
Here's the offer. 
An ice cream. 
I got a really hot chocolate. 
I just couldn't stay up there. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
JEFF V.: 
 Maybe they feel vulnerable. 
Maybe those are the four people
 that feel the most vulnerable. 
I felt vulnerable,
but, you know, 
 I couldn't do it. 
I knew I couldn't do it.
RODGER: 
 Tina out there, she has not 
had anything to eat 
 all day long. 
She didn't eat any breakfast 
 this morning. 
The rest of us all had about 
a little bit over 
 a half a cup of rice. 
And I know 
 they're getting cold, too. 
COLBY: 
 These four are pretty damn 
 determined. 
I've never seen anything 
 like it. 
I had no idea 
 it would last this long. 
There's no telling 
 how long those four 
are gonna stay out there. 
Another fun day 
 for Club Barramundi. 
JEFF: 
 I'll tell you, this fire 
 feels good right here. 
Unfortunately, not enough 
 to heat you up. 
Yeah, we know. 
Is there any more negotiating? 
Maybe. 
What's making you want 
 to negotiate now, 
but you didn't earlier? 
A boat ride back
 might, uh... 
could be worth it. 
COLBY: 
How long you think they're 
going to stay out there? 
JEFF V.: 
 I heard Tina say
"Nothing is bringing me
 down at this point." 
I bet Elisabeth
 goes next. 
JEFF: 
Stay dry, I'll get you in. 
It's past my bedtime. 
Good job, Elisabeth! 
( cheering ) 
 We love you!
ELISABETH: 
 Good job, you guys. 
Go get 'em. 
You okay? 
 You okay? 
Oh, my God, it feels
 so good here. 
You done good, 
we're all proud of you. 
We're all proud of you. 
You guys did a good job.
JEFF V.: 
 I think they've been 
 out there over ten hours now. 
I know that Alicia is concerned
 she's being voted for tonight, 
so I think she's going to stay. 
These people are crazy. 
You guys know we got to go 
to Tribal Council tonight? 
Hey, Jeff.
JEFF: 
 Your faces say a lot. 
But here's what I have. 
Hot coffee, or hot chocolate. 
And a boat ride in? 
JEFF: 
 And a boat ride in. 
I'll take it. 
 I'm done. 
JEFF: 
 All righty. 
 Enough. 
Hey, Tina? 
Hey what? 
I need this. 
TINA: 
 I looked over at Keith 
 and Keith said, 
"Tina, I need this one." 
In his heart he must have 
 really thought 
that he was going to get 
 the votes cast against him. 
I'm done. I want coffee!
Hey, Tina.
You coming with me? 
TINA: 
 I am. 
ALICIA: 
Oh, Tina's getting down. 
TINA: 
 It's the hardest thing 
 I've ever done to come in. 
Much harder to come in 
 than stay out there, 
because I've been out there 
 ten hours. 
I knew for our team that 
 I needed to make that decision.
So I stepped down 
 and let him have it. 
Yes! 
Good work, Keith. 
Wear that. 
( spattered applause ) 
What a day. 
 ( laughing )
What a day. 
You guys just finished 
a marathon 
immunity challenge. 
Come to Tribal Council, 
where unfortunately, 
you're gonna vote 
the first person out 
of your new tribe. 
All right, let's talk 
about today's challenge. 
Nick lasted 
90 minutes. 
Now, at the other end 
of the spectrum, 
Keith lasted 
ten hours, 18 minutes. 
You get immunity. 
Tina, Alicia 
lasted ten hours, 
17 minutes, 55 seconds. 
Alicia, I'm thinking 
you obviously 
must not be worried, 
because you were out there 
for a long time and finally said
"Okay, I guess 
 I've proven my point." 
This challenge felt like 
 it was gonna go on forever.
And I don't think 
 that my stepping off
is gonna change 
what was gonna happen tonight 
 anyways. 
Keith, when I came up to you 
and handed you the talisman, 
 I said, 
"Congratulations," and you said,
 "Tina gave that to me." 
I really firmly believe 
 that if... 
she did not say, 
 "Okay, I'm done now," 
we'd all still be... 
we'd still all be there,
 we really would. 
She's become like my sister, 
 I'm telling you, 
and it was, uh, 
it was definitely a gift. 
JEFF: 
What was it, Tina, 
that finally made you say, 
 "Okay"? 
At this point, 
I'm still a team player. 
Our team advancing
 does mean a lot. 
I know
Keith needed this. 
So... 
it's all right. 
JEFF: 
Rodger, 
when you look 
 at what happened today 
and how many people took a bribe
 sooner or later 
and jumped off, 
do you think 
everybody here 
is really worried? 
Well, everybody 
but Keith, I would say. 
Keith is definitely 
not worried. 
But yes, I think 
any... any one 
of the other nine of us are... 
 has a very good 
possibility 
of being voted off. 
JEFF: 
Here's the deal. 
Survive tonight's vote, 
you are here 
 till the bitter end. 
You'll be part of the jury 
at the very least; 
you may be... final two. 
If you're voted out tonight, 
 game is over. 
You go home, 
and that's it. 
Let's vote. 
Nick, you're up. 
COLBY: 
 It was a, uh, strategic move 
 that was determined 
the first week we were here. 
I really like the guy, 
but he's from the Ogakor tribe 
and they have all got to go. 
TINA: 
 He seemed like 
 a really great guy. 
This is 100% a strategic vote. 
JEFF V.: 
 'Cause everything's 
 bigger and better in Texas... 
this lone star 
has got to go. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
JEFF: 
 Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
 to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
 immediately. 
First vote... 
Colby. 
Colby. 
Jeff. 
Jeff. 
Two votes each, 
Jeff and Colby. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
I'll read the last two. 
One for Jeff. 
That's five. 
Look at that. 
One for Colby. 
We have a tie. 
Okay, in the case 
of a tie, 
here's how it works. 
Jeff, Colby, 
you will not vote. 
The other eight of you 
will vote. 
And as is customary, I'm going 
to give you guys a chance 
to plead your case-- although 
I don't know 
who you're pleading to-- 
this is obviously 
two tribes voting 
completely down 
tribal lines. 
Jeff, we'll start 
with you. 
There's nothing that I can say, 
 I don't think, 
to change anybody's mind. 
If I go home tonight, 
 I will walk out of here 
with a smile on my face, 
and be very proud 
of every moment that I had here.
Colby. 
I only know how 
to play the game one way, 
and that's full-tilt, 
and if that makes me a threat, 
 then so be it, but... 
I'm here for one reason, 
and that's to win, and... 
this is the only way I know how.
What we're going to do is, 
we're going to vote again. 
Nick, you're up first, 
if you would, please. 
Thanks. 
Same rules apply. 
As with any vote, 
 once they're tallied 
the decision is final. 
I'll read the votes. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
Jeff. 
Colby. 
So it's very clear, 
old tribal lines 
run very deep in this group. 
I think we could be here 
 until the sun comes up 
and nobody here is going 
 to change their vote. 
So we're ruling this 
 a deadlocked vote. 
Now what happens, 
the rules state 
we go to votes cast 
in previous Tribal Councils. 
Whoever has more votes, 
 Jeff or Colby, 
will be voted out. 
Colby, how many votes 
have you had cast against you? 
Zero. 
Zero. 
Jeff? 
One that I know of.
Enough. 
You need 
to bring me your torch. 
Jeff, 
the tribe has spoken. 
It's time for you to go. 
I could be wrong, 
but I have a feeling 
over the next few days 
new friendships 
are going to emerge, 
new voting patterns 
will form. 
You guys have had a long day. 
You can grab your torches 
and head back to camp. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode 
and hear what Jeff has to say. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Will tribal loyalties 
 begin to crumble 
when Elisabeth discovers 
 a crack in Ogakor's alliance? 
That makes me sick. 
I'm not going to sit here... 
ALICIA: 
 Oh, I think there's a crack 
 in their tribe right now. 
ELISABETH: 
 If you want to stay here, 
if you want to keep 
 playing this game, 
you better get a little 
 more ruthless sometimes. 
I knew this was going to happen 
because of a very large mouth 
of a former tribe member 
 at Kucha, 
Ogakor knew I had that vote, 
and I knew there was nothing 
 I could do about it. 
So I'm going home 
 and I've had an awesome time. 
This has just been the most 
 amazing experience 
I've ever had 
 in my entire life.
