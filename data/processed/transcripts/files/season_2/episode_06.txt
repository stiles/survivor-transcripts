         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Sparks flew 
 between Kimmi and Alicia. 
Don't wave 
your finger in my face. 
I will always wave my finger... 
What have I said about 
the chickens, though? Nothing! 
I'm tired of you 
 and the ... chickens! 
JEFF: 
 Ogakor had their own problems. 
They kept losing challenges. 
I'm so tired of losing. 
But a pep talk from Colby 
 fired up the troops. 
It is going to take every 
 ounce of strength. 








It is gonna be 
one hell of a show today. 
JEFF: 
 Survivors ready? Go! 
Get it. 
 Get it. 
 Get in. 
Where is it? Here it is. 
After a long losing streak, 
Ogakor rebounded 
 and regained the immunity idol.
We're out! 
( screaming happily ) 
So Kucha made the hike 
 to Tribal Council. 
Next vote, Kimmi. 
The tribe has spoken. 
11 remain. 
Who will be voted out tonight? 








( thunder crashing ) 
ALICIA: 
 Wow, you guys. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my God. 
Did we find the matches? 
( thunder crashing, 
 rain pouring ) 
RODGER: 
 The rain, yes. 
We got to Tribal Council 
 last night, 
hadn't been there probably 
 five minutes, I guess, 
and then all of a sudden, here 
 come the awfulest downpour, 
the heaviest rain 
 we've had since we, 
since we've been here. 
I mean, it really came down, 
 put our fire out. 
So then we had to use, uh, 
 one of our matches 
to light a candle 
 in our, in our hut. 
Got the candles going and 
 searched through and found 
the very warmest, 
 well, not the warmest, 
but really the driest 
 clothes that we had. 
A lot of us had wore our clothes
to Tribal Council that we'd 
been used to sleeping in. 
I know I did, for one. 
 That was a mistake. 
( thunder crashing ) 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my God!
This is crazy. 
Is that coming in 
 from the outside? 
Yeah, I think it is. 
 Oh! 
All right? 
Oh, my God. 
It's coming in hard. 
This is gonna suck. 
ELISABETH: 
 When it rains here, 
 it means you're cold at night, 
You don't sleep. Rain is... 
I mean, it puts you in such 
 an extreme disadvantage. 
It's... it takes you 
 a day to recover from rain. 
I mean, there's a risk 
of getting sick, you're 
 sleeping in the cold, wet. 
There's... there's nothing 
 worse than the rain here. 
( thunder crashing ) 
Nothing worse, 
 'cause being cold 
is guaranteed at night, 
 but cold and wet? 
Stick a fork in me. 
It stinks. 
Good night, Jim Bob.
( chuckling ) 
( chuckling ): 
 Shut up. 
"Jim Bob." 
( thunder crashing ) 
( rain pouring ) 
JEFF V.: 
 I love this place. 
You've gotta love it. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
MICHAEL: 
 It's amazing how you 
 can live off the land. 
Eight city people can come out 
 here and live off the land. 
It's amazing. 
Not only food-wise, 
but shelter-wise 
 and safety wise, 
and, um, heat-wise, 
 and starting a fire 
this morning with wet wood. 
It's just amazing to me. 
It's a whole... 
My outlook on life 
 has changed 180 degrees, 
and I'm this kind of guy. 
I'm this kind... you know, 
 this should be nothing for me, 
but, uh, I am a changed man 
 already, after 16 days. 
Very changed. 
And if I last 
another 16 days, who knows 
what's going to happen to me? 
ALICIA: 
 Today is day 16. 
We are... 
thinking ahead now 
 to, uh, the merger. 
We have four more days 
 until that happens. 
JEFF V.: 
 We started with 16 people. 
Six people are voted out 
 of the Outback. 
Then when it gets to ten people,
everybody comes together 
 into one tribe 
and the game, all of a sudden, 
 becomes every man for himself. 
NICK: 
 There's one more 
 immunity challenge left. 
We have six 
 and they have five, and, uh... 
with a huge advantage because 
the pressure is on them 
 to win the next challenge, 
and, uh, we're really hoping to
 go into the merger six to four,
and that way we could just 
basically 
pick them off one by one. 
JEFF V.: 
 We are a very cocky group. 
It's fun to beat them 
and make fun of it. 
It's fun to, 
to have them talk about 
 how hungry they are, 
and us go in there and win 
 all their food. That's fun. 
AMBER: 
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry. 
There's enough
 in here for...
I'd say three 
tortillas. 
Yeah, I could get three
 tortillas out of that, 
but I'd say we go two.
Oh, my God. 
( laughing softly )
And to think the other 
tribe is eating eggs. 
Bastards. 
And soup, and spices. 
AMBER: 
 And chicken, and pig. 
JERRI: 
 I just, 
at some point, have to get 
my hands on some chocolate. 
I fear I might go psycho... 
and I'm not kidding. 
I had a discussion with Colby 
regarding chocolate and how 
chocolate releases the same 
endorphins that sex does, and 
since none of us are having sex,
that-that's probably why 
 we keep reverting 
to the chocolate discussions. 
I'm going to bathe 
 myself in chocolate.
AMBER: 
I can't get over... 
I just want to bite 
into one of those so bad 
it's unbelievable. 
Like, a peppermint patty. 
JERRI: 
 Right now, I can actually, 
in my wildest fantasy, 
picture pouring hot chocolate 
 all over... 
some hot dude's bod 
and having sex while licking it 
 off at the same time. 
That's, like, my ultimate 
 fantasy right now. 
It's like when you 
 pull apart the chocolate... 
( Jerri squeals ) 
...ooze down. 
COLBY: 
 When you're asleep at night 
 in the tent, 
and you hear moaning and 
 groaning about Hershey Kisses, 
you know what's really going on
 mentally. 
It ain't about the chocolate. 
JERRI: 
 Vanilla ice cream. 
Oh, my God. Yes! 
JERRI: 
 with hot fudge dribbled 
 all over the top! 
( both scream ) 
COLBY: 
 She's using her thoughts 
 of chocolate to substitute 
for her thoughts of sex. 
It's just making for a very 
 uncomfortable camping trip. 
AMBER: 
 Peppermint Pattie! 
JERRI: 
 I think Colby's afraid of me. 
Because this fantasy I have 
 about chocolate and sex 
definitely involves him. 
Oh, God, I can't take. 
I can't take it anymore! 
I may be a lot of things, 
 but I ain't no Hershey bar. 
( laughing ) 
JERRI: 
 Snickers! 
AMBER: 
Kit Kats, Milky Way, M&Ms! 
Reese's Cup! 
A meatball sub! 
JERRI: 
 Oh, yeah! 
I love those! 
This is ridiculous man. 
They're driving me nuts. 
( girls yelling, bongo playing )
Bring on Kucha. 
Get rid of these goons, 
 and let's get something going. 
This is crazy. 
( Jerri laughing ) 
Oh, my God! 
Hey, girls, guess 
 what's for dinner?
( laughs ) 
BOTH: 
 Rice. 
We're having white rice.
( both moan ) 
( plays bongo ) 
( hawk screeches ) 
ELISABETH: 
 Chicken feed, huh? 
RODGER: 
 I really don't think 
there's a thing in there 
 that will hurt you. 
ELISABETH: 
I think it would probably 
 be better cooked, 
we know it's clean... 
 after I eat a handful. 
Oh, yes. 
I just wonder if it's been, 
 like, stepped on and stuff 
by other chickens, and... 
RODGER: 
 Well, if it's 
 cooked. 
That's good, 
actually. 
Actually, not bad. 
( muttering softly ): 
 This is the best way 
to do it. 
You want... you 
 want to try to...?
ALICIA: 
 Chicken feed. 
We bring back the chickens, 
 the rooster, the chicken feed, 
and, of course, 
in true Kucha style, 
we're trying to figure out how 
 we can utilize 
every single little thing 
 we brought back. 
Elisabeth and I said, 
"Can we eat that?" 
Because it just looks like nuts
and grains and corn and wheat, 
and, you know, it just looks 
 so good to us for some reason. 
And he's talking to us like, 
"Yeah, it's good for you." 
Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
Yeow. 
You guys, it's popping. 
You guys should see this stuff. 
It's popping like popcorn. 
You guys, come here quick. 
It is popcorn! 
It's popcorn! 
It's cracking, it's popping. 
ALICIA: 
 Can you believe that? 
It is popcorn. Popcorn. 
There's popcorn in this pan. 
This camp just gets better 
 and better every minute. 
Ow! Wow! Ow. 
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
JEFF V.: 
 I don't know 
about this chicken pop feed, 
 whatever. 
I just... I don't know. 
It's good, and I hated it, 
the whole thought of eating 
 chicken feed just made me sick.
But the more I eat it, 
 the better it gets. 
ALICIA: 
 Do you love it? 
Oh, my God. 
That just, we-- forget it. 
We are now addicted. 
It's so good. 
Oh, my gosh. 
ALICIA: 
 And we now have, 
like, chicken popcorn. 
We wake up in the morning, 
 we make it. 
After we eat breakfast, 
in the afternoon, we make it. 
( thunder crashing ) 
At night, we make it. 
And we're going to find out, 
 like, somewhere down the road 
that, like, 
 something was in it, 
and we're going to have, like, 
 eight nipples and laying eggs, 
and I don't know, 
 but until that happens, 
I'm going to keep eating it 
 because it's so good. 
It's so good. 
Let's kill those chickens so 
 they don't eat any more feed. 
( laughs ) 
( chicken clucking ) 
KEITH: 
 Jerri and Amber 
 went to pick some tomatoes. 
Jerri has, um, decided she wants
 to do fried green tomatoes, 
but they're cherry tomatoes. 
I can tantalize our taste buds 
with fried green 
 tomatoes this evening.
Getting creative. 
Have to. 
Ooh, thank you. 
They aren't quite 
as ripe, but... 
KEITH: 
 You don't do fried green 
 tomatoes with cherry tomatoes. 
My thought was 
 maybe leave them on the vine 
just another couple days, 
 they'll be nice 
and bright red and real juicy 
and good to eat. 
Another day and 
 those would have been perfect. 
But, uh, doesn't look 
 like that's going to happen. 
Well, it just 
would help if you weren't 
quite so pessimistic about ideas
that other people have
 other than your own. 
I wasn't 
pessimistic. 
I'm not picking on you 
about you tomatoes. 
You already did 
 on the way here. 
You said, "I don't think 
 that can be done." 
That's good, well, 
then this will be good. 
We have fried 
green tomatoes. 
COLBY: 
 Keith and Jerri, are just... 
Like two alley cats 
scratching at each other. 
They're fighting over fried 
 green tomatoes, of all things, 
and it's ridiculous 
 that the rest of us 
have to sit through all this. 
Put this over here 
 and let that sit awhile. 
JERRI: 
 Yeah, I think it's
 done yet, Keith. 
It looks 
totally soupy. 
It needs to sit there 
 till it's dry. 
It's going 
 to be soupy.
COLBY: 
 Keith is a chef, man. 
You don't have to insult 
 the guy by telling him 
he doesn't know 
 what he's talking about. 
I think it's 
 disrespectful and rude, 
and-and that's what 
 Jerri loves to do 
because she knows it's going 
 to ruffle his feathers. 
You got to let
 the rice sit. 
You can't, it's 
double the amount of rice. 
It's sticking to 
the bottom and burning. 
It's all 
breaking up, though. 
It's 'cause you 
 kept stirring it. 
You've got to leave
 it in there. 
TINA: 
Stop it! 
Both of you! 
 Or you're going to time out. 
I'm not their mother. 
It's not my position 
 to get in the middle 
and send them both to time out, 
but to be honest, I think one 
 of the problems needs to go. 
We can't afford 
 for people not to get along. 
Jerri makes me feel 
 uncomfortable. 
You know, you're always walking
 on eggshells around her, 
and it's just no fun living 
 in that type of situation. 
Another tin? 
Oh, yeah! 
They're kind of like okra. 
They really are 
 kind of like okra. 
Did you try one? 
 You didn't like it?
It has a sour... 
almost a sour bite to it. 
It's 'cause 
 they're green.
( chuckles ) 
So the fried green 
tomatoes sucked. 
I knew they would. 
Poor Colby stomached all 
 of them, including mine. 
Told her they were great, 
'cause Colby is a gentleman. 
But I do not like them. 
AMBER: 
 What will the reward be today?!
JERRI: 
 I don't know. 
I'm feeling good 
about it today, though. 
"The next challenge you face 
 is no walk in the park. 
"Now we'll find out 
who's afraid of the dark. 
"To lead the whole tribe 
there can only be one. 
The winners will picnic 
and the losers get none!" 
A picnic! 
Oh, my God!
Like a barbecue!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
( screaming joyfully ) 
I think I lost it.
Yeah! Oh, my God! 
KEITH: 
 This better be good. 
JERRI: 
Oh, my God. 
Peanut butter 
 and jelly sandwiches. 
A picnic! 
Food! 
Can you imagine, 
like, real food! 
Ham sandwiches. 
I can't, oh... 
You know there's 
going to be dessert. 
Tina! 
And there's food involved. 
Yes, there is.
A huge amount of food! 
"The winners will picnic 
 and the losers get none." 
AMBER: 
 Picnic. A picnic. 
And I am not afraid 
of the dark, sister. 
( whooping ) 
I have really good, uh, vision. 
If it's in
 the water,
we're afraid
 of the dark.
We don't want to 
 be in the dark. 
We're not leading, 
 we're not leading the tribe. 
I'll follow.
The winners will... 
 Me, too. 
Picnic. 
Picnic, honey. 
NICK: 
 We just got our tree mail 
for tonight's reward challenge.
It sounds like 
we're going to be doing 
 something at night, 
almost definitely. 
Um, and it says, 
"to lead the whole tribe 
 there can only be one." 
Um, so it sounds like one person
will be leading the tribe 
 through the dark. 
You're good, you're good, 
 you're good. 
Hate to see 
what we look like. 
Okay, toward
 my voice. 
Toward my voice,
 toward my voice.
ALICIA: 
 We don't want the opposition 
 to win the picnic 
because we have a big immunity 
 challenge tomorrow 
and, uh, if they win, 
it could... it could give 
them that little boost, 
uh, and we don't want 
them to have that. 
Towards my voice, 
towards my voice. 
Towards my... 
good, good. 
JERRI: 
 Definitely.
AMBER: 
Oh, my God, a picnic 
is so much better. 
There's no mess. 
 No plucking, no cutting.
AMBER: 
 It's already
 made for us.
JERRI: 
 Oh, a bottle 
 of chardonnay.
A little cheese and crackers. 
Uphill a little bit. 
Go straight.
I'm sorry. 
 Right, right. 
To your right 
 a little bit. 
Right, straight,
 straight. 
( Jerri giving 
 instructions softly ) 
...upright standing 
position. 
Put your hands 
above your head... 
interlacing 
your fingers... 
pointing to the sky.
If Kucha wins this reward, 
it would suck! 
( laughs ) 
They don't deserve it. 
They've been eating 
 like kings over there, 
and I think it would be 
 really nice of them 
if they threw this one for us. 
Picnic, picnic, 
 picnic, picnic... 
Ah... picnic! 
Dinner-- it's all 
about the grub. 
JERRI: 
 That's right. 
JEFF: 
 Come on in, guys. 
How goes it?
Good. 
 Good. 
Want to know 
 what you're playing for? 
Yeah! 
Yes, yes. 
Give you a little, uh, sample-- 
one Doritos chip for each tribe.
Oh! Doritos! 
A Doritos! 
Can we take it? 
You go first, buddy.
Oh, my God. 
Take a bite. 
AMBER: 
 Oh, my God!
Wow!
One chip and one sip. 
( joyfully squealing ) 
Oh, my God! 
Something 
besides water. 
JEFF: 
 A little Mountain Dew. 
 Do the Dew. 
Do the Dew, baby! 
It's cold, it's cold. 
Wow.
Oh, my God. 
That'll get you guys going. 
You the man. 
Unbelievable! 
Taste that.
Oh, my God, 
 it's so good. 
Certainly you guys have figured 
 out to survive out here 
you have to be able 
 to trust each other, 
to a certain degree anyway. 
Each tribe will select 
 one set of eyes-- 
that will be 
 your tribe's leader. 
The rest of the tribe 
 will be blindfolded, 
and it's your leader's 
 communication skills 
that are going to be 
 the name of this game. 
Sitting atop 
 two elevated perches 
and using only your voices, 
 the two chosen leaders-- 
Jerri for Ogakor, 
 Nick for Kucha-- 
you're going 
 to navigate your blind tribes 
through a series of tasks. 
The first tribe to complete 
 all the tasks wins the reward. 
Here's how the course works: 
First task involves 
 two logs and a sawhorse. 
You need to get the logs 
 into the sawhorse. 
Your next task: 
 get to this table, 
take this trap, 
 switch it for the other trap 
that's in the water. 
When you've completed that, 
 you'll see a series of buckets.
Each member needs 
 to get a bucket, 
go to the water tower, 
 fill their bucket with water. 
Once it's full, 
 guide them to the wine barrel, 
have them dump their water 
 into the wine barrel. 
When the wine barrel overflows,
 you move to the final task. 
That is, getting the picnic 
 basket to the finish table. 
First tribe to get their basket
 on the table wins the reward. 
Survivors ready! Go! 
NICK: 
Okay, stay there, 
stay there. 
Hold hands. 
Hold hands 
 and walk straight.
Walk straight. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
Bend down, bend down... 
There's a sawhorse, 
there's two logs. 
No, Mike, stay. 
 Mike, back up. 
There's a log. 
 Jeff, you've got a... 
JERRI: 
Tina, keep going straight. 
Keep going straight. 
Stop! Stop! 
Colby, Tina, stop. 
Amber, Keith, kick to your left.
Towards me, towards me. 
Keith and Amber, come forward. 
The other way. 
Walk straight, Alicia. 
There you go. 
No, no, okay, stop. 
There's a log 
 by your leg, Colby. 
You're going to pick it up, 
pick it up. 
There's a sawhorse to your left,
a sawhorse to your left. 
You're going to put it on 
the sawhorse at both ends. 
Amber, Keith! 
Amber, Keith, go back! 
Go back! 
There you go, there you go, 
 there you go, you got one. 
Okay, Elisabeth stay there, 
there you go. 
There you go. 
There, stop, drop it, drop it. 
Colby, go the other side of 
the sawhorse, go the other side.
Climb over it if you have to. 
There's another log. 
You're going to do 
the same exact thing. 
Okay, walk forward, 
 walk forward, 
walk forward. 
There you go, 
there you go... 
Walk, two more steps. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
There's a trap, 
just like our fish trap. 
Grab that, grab that, okay. 
Look, stop. 
There's a yabby trap 
on the table. 
A what? 
A yabby trap. 
Grab it, shuffle side step 
 to your right. 
You're going to go in 
the water, in the water. 
In the water 
is another yabby trap. 
Go... shuff... no! 
Colby, back step. 
NICK: 
One step forward, 
one step more, 
Mike and Elisabeth. 
It's hooked around the flag. 
Go back. Colby, it's 
hooked around the flag. 
Lift it up, then around. 
No, no, no, the other way, 
the other way, the other way. 
No, Colby, down. 
( yells ): 
God! 
Colby, underneath, 
underneath the rope, 
 underneath the rope, 
underneath it. 
Okay. 
Now shuffle, 
side step, side step, 
Tina, to your right. 
You're going to go in the water.
You're going to go in the water.
Stop, right in front of you 
 is a table. 
Right in front of you 
is a table. 
Mike, drop the trap 
 on the table. 
There you go, 
there you go. 
Mike, Elisabeth, side step left,
side step left. 
Side step left, side step left, 
side step left. 
Stop, stop, stop! 
Forward, Jeff. 
Three steps forward, 
three steps forward. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
There's a bucket right 
in front of you. 
Up on land, up on land. 
Go backwards, go backwards. 
Yabby trap on the table. 
On the table. 
Set it down. 
Come forward, 
come forward. 
Colby stop, reach down. 
Um, there's going to be buckets,
 there are buckets 
in front of you. 
Right to your left. 
Yeah, grab that bucket. 
Tina, there's 
another bucket. 
Everybody, side step left.
Whose left?
( Nick and Jerri shouting ) 
JERRI: 
Okay, you guys, now, 
both of you move forward. 
 Go forward... 
Go, go! 
 You can just keep going. 
Keep going back, 
 backwards, backwards. 
There's a silo back there. 
There's a hook 
that you're going to pull 
and fill your buckets 
 with water. 
Face to your left and go. 
 There's a straight open shot. 
Keith, go to your right. 
Keith, go 
 to your right.
Jerri! 
Move to the right of the silo. 
There you go. 
Right above your head, 
there is a thing 
 you're going to pull. 
Right... No!
Keith and Amber, 
backwards, 
backwards, backwards. 
Jerri! 
 Keep going
 backwards.
Pull it! 
Colby, pull it. 
Pull it, you'll feel water. 
Fill up your bucket. 
NICK: 
 Follow Alicia.
Side step, side step, 
 side step. 
Amber, Keith, go straight, 
 go straight! 
You're going to feel Colby. 
There's water-- 
 fill up your buckets. 
Fill up your buckets. 
NICK: 
 Jeff, to your left. 
 Straight! 
Your hands straight in the air. 
 There you go, Jeff, grab it. 
Fill the bucket! 
 Fill the bucket! 
Fill the bucket! 
( Jerri yelling ) 
NICK: 
 Fill the bucket! 
Colby, take your full bucket, 
walk towards my voice. 
Keep coming straight, 
 straight, straight. 
You got it, you got it. 
There's a thing. 
 Dump your thing in... 
dump your water in there. 
Stop! 
JERRI: 
 Dump it in, dump it in. 
NICK: 
 Follow my voice.
Follow my voice. 
 Now go backwards. 
JERRI: 
 Go back to the waterfall, go. 
Tina, come towards my voice. 
NICK: 
 You need to stop. 
Okay, bend down 
 with your right hand. 
There's a big bucket, a big tub.
 There you go, Jeff. 
Pour your bucket. 
Pour your bucket in there. 
There you go, there you go. 
Okay, you guys need to do 
the same thing 
 you just did, okay? 
Stop, stop! 
 Keep going forward! 
Now in front of you 
 is a wheelbarrow. 
Dump it in, dump it in, 
 dump it in! 
Dump it in! 
Amber, Keith, move forward, 
 move forward! 
Okay. 
Keep moving... stop! 
 Stop, stop! 
Mike, Elisabeth, 
 follow my voice. 
Step forward, step forward. 
Mike, to your right, 
 Mike, to your right. 
Okay, okay, Mike... 
 Mike, stop, Mike, stop! 
Okay, bend down. 
You'll feel a big barrel, 
big barrel to your right. 
Fill it up. 
 Grab Amber! 
Grab Amber!
Fill the wheelbarrow! 
Fill the wheelbarrow! 
We got enough?
Good enough?! 
You're good. 
( screams happily ): 
 Okay, Keith, Amber, 
towards me, towards me, now. 
Straight, straight. 
Stop, Amber, stop. 
 Amber, stop. 
Jeff, Alicia, stop, stop, 
 Jeff, stop. 
Pour it right below you. 
There you go. 
Pour, Alicia, pour. 
...picnic basket! 
 Pick it up! Pick it up! 
You're good. 
Okay, okay, drop the buckets. 
 Drop the buckets. 
Come to my voice, quick, 
 quick, quick, quick, quick! 
Right, right, no, no, 
 no, behind you! 
( yelling ) 
Go, go, go! 
Amber, stop! 
Go forward. 
No, stop! 
Rotate to your right, 
rotate to your right. 
 All right, stop. 
Forward, forward, 
 forward, forward! 
Tina! Amber, behind you! 
 Amber, behind you! 
Kucha! 
 ( cheering ) 
( cheering ) 
Oh, my God! 
You were awesome! 
Yes! 
 You were awesome! 
( cheering ) 
You guys, 
I can't even see! 
( cheering ) 
Whoo! 
Oh, my God! 
You guys! 
( whooping )
Nick, good job!
 Nick! 
You all have no idea 
how close that was. 
ALICIA:
 Yes! 
( whooping, laughing ) 
Good work, baby.
Thank you, thank you. 
I needed that. 
TINA: 
 Everybody here knows 
the importance 
 of winning today. 
Everybody. 
It is a have-to-win day. 
That's pressure. 
If we lose the challenge today, 
that means we will be down 
 four to six. 
The other tribe will probably 
 just pick us off one by one. 
COLBY: 
 If we don't pull this 
 thing off today, 
I don't think it's over at all. 
That seems to be the attitude 
 of everyone-- 
just lay down and die 
if we don't pull 
 this thing off. 
I'm certainly not going 
 to just sit around and wait 
to be picked off by Kucha, 
 once we merge. 
That's not happening 
 with this kid. 
JERRI: 
 There's a weird tension 
 in the camp right now. 
Colby wants to just think 
 about nothing but the game, 
and then Amber and Tina are 
 braiding each other's hair 
and talking about college days.
AMBER: 
...than everybody else. 
And it's funny because 
in my sophomore year... 
JERRI: 
 Everybody was kind 
 of chitchatting 
and being very lighthearted, 
and I needed to get more 
 centered and focused. 
KEITH: 
 It was around my head, 
 it catches the back... 
JERRI: 
 So I knew that I needed 
 to get away from camp. 
KEITH: 
 And go like this and 
 it all like, whoosh, 
and now it's dark out, and I'm 
all tangled in this line and... 
COLBY: 
 Everyone was kind of going 
in their different 
 directions, 
and I decided just 
 to come upstream, 
and think about the game. 
You have to be a lot more 
 selfish when you merge, 
because at that point 
 it is all about 
getting yourself 
 as far as you can go. 
You can't help but think about 
 what's around the corner. 
JERRI: 
 Everyone else in the camp 
 is looking at it as if, 
if we lose today, that's it, 
 we're all going 
to be sitting ducks, 
we're going 
 to get picked off one by one. 
I see it almost as an 
 opportunity to, uh, 
finagle my way 
into the other tribe a bit 
and mix things up, 
and freak some people out. 
If they're going to pick us off
 one by one, 
I'm at least going to cause 
 a big ruckus going down. 
I'm going 
 to wreak a little havoc. 
MICHAEL: 
Four bites, two fish, that's it.
They died in the tin just as 
fast as they died anywhere else.
I don't think 
I put enough water in it. 
I put enough 
 to cover their backs, but... 
I don't know 
 if it got too hot. 
It was hot out there... Ooh. 
ALICIA: 
It is hot. 
I say we eat Doritos 
 and popcorn as a snack 
and then have the fish and rice 
 as a dinner. 
( birds chittering ) 
( Michael screaming ) 
Get some water! 
NICK: 
You okay? 
( Michael groans in pain ) 
ALICIA: 
Oh, my God. 
He's burnt. 
 He's burnt pretty bad, Teri. 
ELISABETH: 
 Here's some water. 
JEFF V.: 
 What happened? 
NICK: 
He passed out in the fire. 
JEFF V.: 
 Passed out and fell 
 in the fire. 
ELISABETH: 
 He passed out 
 in the fire. 
NICK: 
 Stay in the water, 
 stay in the water. 
( birds squawking ) 
Do you want me to 
 come in with you, Mike, 
and swim with you? 
JEFF V.: 
 You passed out? 
I-I was blowing on the fire 
and the smoke went right 
 in my face, 
and I inhaled it, 
 and I passed out. 
( Michael groans ) 
Look at these things. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh... Keep your hands 
 in the water. 
RODGER: 
Oh, Mike. 
Oh, my God. 
I can't decide whether I should 
keep trying to bend them or not.
ALICIA: 
No, don't, don't, 
don't. 
ELISABETH: 
 No, no, Mike, 
 Mike... 
RODGER: 
 Hang on. 
 Now don't...
don't get out in
 the deep in case
 you pass out. 
ELISABETH: 
Yeah, I'm just nervous 
he's going to go into shock. 
( Michael groans loudly ) 
They just keep... 
 it keeps intensifying. 
ALICIA: 
I know, 
I know, Mike. 
RODGER: 
Don't get out 
in the deep, Mike. 
I'm not, I'm not. 
 I'm on my knees. 
Oh, they're stiffening up. 
ELISABETH: 
You're good. 
Okay, Mike, they're 
coming right now. 
ALICIA: 
They're coming 
right now. 
Just leave yourself 
right where you are. 
They're going to put stuff on 
 there, Mike. 
You're gonna feel good. 
They'll wrap it up for you. 
Hang on, Mike. 
ELISABETH: 
You're good, 
you're good. 
Stay strong, Mike. 
Stay strong. 
( Michael moaning ) 
RODGER: 
 His hands are bad.
Stay strong. 
RODGER: 
Don't go out any 
deeper than what you are. 
Stay right there 
where you're at. 
( Michael moaning ) 
( Michael groans loudly ) 
You okay? You okay?
( inaudible ) 
( groans loudly ) 
ALICIA: 
The medics 
are on the way. 
They're going to look 
at everything, okay? 
Ah, I'm okay. 
( yells ) 
( screaming ) 
ALICIA: 
Just relax. 
Don't even look at them. 
Don't even look at them, 
'cause it'll 
make you feel worse. 
Was he bent over, 
 working on the fire? 
No, he leaned 
 all the way over 
and then he started 
 shaking in the fire 
and jumped out. 
I thought he was having 
 a seizure or something. 
ALICIA: 
 ...wrap them up, 
 you're going to feel better. 
RODGER: 
 I'd keep them in the 
 water till they get here. 
( Michael screams in pain ) 
( Michael screaming ) 
MEDIC: 
Keep 'em in. 
Whoo... that was painful. 
Watch out, 
 there's a rock... 
You guys just tell me 
 what to do. 
On the face, on the face. 
 Thank you. Please. 
Thank you, thank you. 
I'm good, I'm good. 
ALICIA: 
 He's right there, 
 he's right there. 
You feel him? 
( Michael groans ) 
Man, I messed up bad, buddy. 
What did you do? 
MICHAEL: 
 I got a big 
 inhalation of smoke, 
and I passed out
 in the fire. 
MEDIC: 
 Okay, well... 
MICHAEL: 
 You can shoot me, 
you can... 
 shots, drugs, pain... 
If-if I don't... 
 I can take it. 
I'll take whatever you give me. 
I'll take the pain 
 without drugs. 
I'll do whatever 
 you guys say. 
ELISABETH: 
They're going to give you 
a shot right now, baby. 
MICHAEL: 
I don't care. 
If it's good, it's good. 
You just do it. 
MEDIC: 
It's an anesthetic, okay? 
Okay... breathe...
When you breathe it 
in and breathe it out... 
Okay. 
...it'll calm you down.. 
Through my... through 
 my mouth only? 
Through your mouth. 
MEDIC 2: 
 In and out through 
 the same pipe, Mike.
( muttering ) 
MEDIC: 
I think we'll try 
and move him to the shoulder 
as soon as we can. 
( all talking at once ) 
We're just going 
to bring you out 
and put dressing on 
to start with. 
MICHAEL: 
Okay. 
MEDIC 2: 
Mike, we're going 
to do some cold dressings 
around them, 
mate. 
Just in case... 
That's the way. 
Excellent. 
One for the other arm. 
MEDIC: 
Put your other arm out, 
other arm out. 
RODGER: 
 Y'all got him?
ALICIA: 
 Yeah, we got him. 
MEDIC 2: 
Okay, buddy. 
Come on, step... 
I've got the shoulders. 
( speaking indistinctly ) 
Keep walking there, mate. 
Keep walking. 
Your feet all right
 there, Mike? 
( speaking indistinctly ) 
We got a bed up here 
 ready... ready to go. 
One, two, three. 
Okay, have a lay 
 down there, mate. 
( screaming ) 
( medics speaking indistinctly )
Here we go. 
One, two, three, down. 
ALICIA: 
Hey, Mike. 
MEDIC: 
 Said he wants to be 
 transferred to Ogakor.
RODGER: 
 Gonna switch tribes
 on us, boy? 
I love you guys! 
ELISABETH: 
 Love you, Mike!
( indistinct conversation ) 
MICHAEL: 
Where's my tribe? 
RODGER: 
 Calm down.
Kucha! 
Good-bye, baby.
( indistinct conversation ) 
Bye, baby. 
We love you. 
ELISABETH: 
You're good. 
( indistinct conversation ) 
Thank you, Jo. 
RODGER: 
 I'll keep them in 
 line for you, buddy.
Don't you worry about it. 
( indistinct conversation ) 
Everybody's here. 
I can't see Rodger. 
JEFF V.: 
 He's here. 
RODGER: 
 Here I am...
You thought I'd gone
 fishing, didn't you?
I can't see 
 Elisabeth anymore. 
RODGER: 
 Here's Elisabeth
 right here. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm right here.
MICHAEL: 
I'm looking 
at some brave, 
beautiful people who I have 
 just grown to love so much. 
We're all good, Mike. 
Don't even worry about it. 
A-OK. 
MICHAEL: 
I just want to lock eyes 
with my boys and girls... 
ELISABETH: 
 We're right
 here, Mike.
...from Kucha. 
We'll see you 
soon, okay? 
Hang in there,
 buddy. 
MICHAEL: 
I love you, guys. 
 Stay strong. 
You guys do what's right. 
You guys know what to do. 
RODGER:
 Okay. 
You guys know what to do. 
You know exactly what to do. 
ALICIA: 
 How many fish 
 do you want? 
JEFF V.: 
 See you, Mike.
Hang in there, buddy. 
( engine accelerating ) 
? ? 
? ? 
( bird screeching ) 
( quietly ): 
 Here it is... 
Oh, no. 
Oh, my God. 
AMBER: 
All right! 
( whooping ) 
It's a little disturbing. 
KEITH: 
 Uh-oh. 
Oh, no. 
JERRI: 
Don't get too excited. 
AMBER: 
It's our last tree mail. 
I know. It's... 
 it's a little strange. 
"There has been an accident 
 at the Kucha camp... 
AMBER: 
Oh, no! 
"...and one of their members
 has been evacuated. 
( gasps ) 
"As a result, there
 will be no immunity
 challenge today... 
( gasps ) 
 "...and all five of 
 you will continue 
"to the merge. 
You will receive further 
instructions soon." 
Oh, my God! 
Yeah. 
That's awful. 
Oh, my gosh. 
JERRI: 
Yeah. 
Hopefully, 
 they're all right. 
Hope... 
I wonder that this means. 
Like, I wonder if we... 
if... if they... 
have five or... 
If they have someone hurt, 
they have five now, right? 
Right. I hope it's 
not a snakebite. 
I hope it's something 
that heals, like... 
a broken... you know. 
( Tina moans ) 
 I think a snakebite
might be better than
 a broken something. 
"Evacuated." 
I mean, that's... 
 that's hard-core. 
ELISABETH: 
 It was... it was 
 so strange to sit there, 
and we're all smiling at him, 
 and he's cracking jokes. 
And it was so hard, 
 'cause the minute, you know, 
the minute he was out of sight,
it was like decompress 
 and just, like, 
"Oh, gosh, 
 did that just happen?" 
( voice breaking ): 
 And it just really hit hard. 
Because it makes you... 
makes you realize that... 
you're out here for a period of 
 time with a group of people, 
and you're doing everything 
together and, you know... 
you win games, you lose games, 
 you know, 
you're sleeping 
 in the same quarters, 
and one of your teammates 
 goes down. 
And for him 
 to ask to see each of us... 
I mean, I know at one point 
 he was, like, 
"Well, wait, 
 I can't see Elisabeth." 
And I'm... I was, like, 
 behind someone. 
I'm like, 
 "I'm right here, Mike." 
You know, "Here I am." 
And his eyes were just locked 
 on ours, locked. 
RODGER: 
 We're going to either 
 go win this thing 
or lose this thing as a team, 
 I think. 
I don't think there's-- 
 unless somebody jumps... 
jumps boat on us in-in mid... 
 in the middle.... 
in the middle of the stream, 
 which is possible-- 
uh, we're either going to stick 
 together as a team, 
and, uh, possibly Mike's 
accident, uh, might have brought
some of them 
 to the realization that, 
you know, maybe there's 
 other things more important 
than even the million dollars, 
 you know. 
JEFF V.: 
 This merge is going 
 to be intense. 
Ogakor will be relieved. 
I think that they'll... 
 I mean, I think 
they're good people, 
 and I think that-that 
they're going to feel bad, 
and sincerely have compassion 
 for us and for Mike. 
Um, but they weren't 
 part of that. 
They didn't experience it. 
 They didn't... 
hear it. 
And so that feeling of, 
 "Oh, my goodness!" 
it's going to have to be very 
 quickly replaced with relief. 
That we're merging together, 
'cause we had them, we had 'em. 
They had to have been scared. 
 They had to have been afraid. 
There was no way we were losing
 this challenge today; no way. 
And, um... 
we're going to... 
 we're going to kill 'em. 
We're going to eat 'em up 
 and spit 'em out, 
and that's the way 
Mike would want it to be. 
It was the last thing he said 
 to us before he left, 
and it's exactly 
 what we're going to do. 
? ? 
RODGER: 
 Father God, 
 we give Thee thanks today 
for this beautiful Lord's day 
and for all Thy many 
 wonderful blessings. 
We thank Thee, dear Lord, 
 for this food, 
which Mike caught 
 for us today, 
and we pray, dear Lord, 
that You will be with him 
as he undergoes surgery. 
We pray that You will be 
 with the doctors. 
Uh, give them the knowledge and 
 the experience and the wisdom 
uh, to fix his hands 
 so that they will be 
once again returned to normal. 
We just pray that-that
 You will be with him, 
 be with his family, 
and we just ask 
that, uh, uh, You 
would bless them 
and give them 
 strength. 
And we would 
 ask, dear Lord,
that You would also 
 bless the ones remaining
 here in this group, 
and, uh, ask that 
 You would be with us
and give us Your guidance 
 and also Your strength 
 and Your support. 
For it is in Your 
 Son's holy name 
 we ask it. Amen. 
Amen. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode 
and hear 
 what Michael has to say. 
Next time on Survivor: 
JERRI: 
 We're moving! 
Due to Michael's accident, 
 Kucha 
and Ogakor will merge 
 with five members each. 
Damn it. 
 Is it a time of celebration? 
( cheering ) 
 Or do tribal loyalties 
 run deep? 
JEFF V.: 
 I saw Colby walk over to Keith,
 and they're, like, pointing 
at us and counting fingers, 
like, "She's going to go first"
and "He's going to go second." 
We weren't together 15 minutes 
 and it started. 
You don't... you 
 don't want to leave. 
The lo... 
 the longer you're here, 
the longer 
 you want to stay here. 
And it's not even about winning 
 as much as... playing. 
The winning will 
 be anticlimactic. 
The playing is where 
 it is for me.
