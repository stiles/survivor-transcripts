         JEFF: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Two tribes were abandoned 
in the middle 
 of the Australian outback... 
"Ogakor." 
Ogakor. 
"Kucha." 
We're Kucha? 
...and had to make 
 a treacherous hike 
to find their camps. 
I'm a little tired. 
This rice is very heavy. 
JEFF: 
 But not everybody could 
 stomach the trek. 
JEFF V.: 
 All of a sudden, 
 I just got sort of nauseous, 








and I kept thinking to myself, 
"I'm not going to get sick." 
( retching ) 
JEFF: 
 At Ogakor, tensions simmered 
 between Keith and Jerri. 
I don't even really want 
to attempt to start a fire 
until we get it 
where we want to keep it. 
I think we start the fire... 
 we take it where we want to. 
He might very well 
 not even be aware 
of some of the condescending 
remarks he made to me, 
but I'm not the kind of 
person to just let it 
 slide off my back. 
JEFF: 
 At Kucha, 
 there wasn't enough food 
to put in their mouths... 








I'm looking at bugs. 
JEFF: 
 ...but there was plenty 
of Kimmi's mouth to go around. 
KIMMI: 
 We was back-to-back, 
 he farted in my... 
It rebounded... 
JEFF V.: 
 Kimmi will not shut up. 
I just want to grab her 
 by the neck 
and shake the ... 
 out of her. 
JEFF: 
 Ogakor won 
 the immunity challenge... 
The immunity idol. 
...so Kucha had 
 to make the long hike 
to Tribal Council. 
Debb was the first person 
 voted out. 
The tribe has spoken. 
JEFF: 
 15 people left. 
Who will be voted out tonight? 
JEFF V.: 
 I saw Mike getting up 
 really early. 
The sun was just coming up. 
Everybody was asleep, 
 and I woke up 
and I saw Mike messing 
 around with the fire 
and putting stuff on the pot, 
and I couldn't understand 
 what he was doing. 
And so as we were waking up, 
 we realized he put rice on, 
and nobody said anything 
 about eating rice. 
Nobody said they were hungry. 
And he left. 
He just put the rice on, 
 and he left. 
Are you making rice?
Mike is. 
Mike's making rice 
 already? 
I hope everybody's hungry. 
I'm not hungry at all. 
That was totally not cool.
No, I don't think that was good.
When it comes to food, 
it has to be a group decision, 
since we don't have much. 
Mike was hungry. 
That's why he did that. 
And that is another indication 
of Mike being Mike; 
 about himself. 
Every day we've been 
 having breakfast 
first thing in the morning, 
and I got up, and I thought 
 I was being really helpful, 
and I cleaned the pot 
 and I boiled the water 
and I made the rice, 
and I was going 
 to have a warm meal 
for everybody 
 when they woke up. 
Dig in, let's go. 
ALICIA: 
 It's like rice porridge. 
JEFF V.: 
 It cooked too long, 
and it was mashy and just nasty.
KIMMI: 
 You know what? 
 We could use this 
as the wallpaper glue 
 to hold everything together. 
MICHAEL: 
 It was odd that in fact 
it not only wasn't 
 appreciated, 
they didn't like it. 
KIMMI: 
 Mike, baby, we love you, 
but you're not qualified. 
MICHAEL: 
 I think people are starting 
to get a little bit edgy 
 without food, 
and they don't realize how bad 
 it's going to get. 
I'm a student of nutrition, 
and I know what this is doing 
 to my body. 
But these other people 
 have no idea. 
If they did, they would be out 
 fishing and hunting for food. 
But they don't. 
I guess maybe the way 
 that I can convince them 
of the importance of the food 
 is by catching a lot of it 
and then feeling full one time 
 and seeing 
what happens to their body 
 and how much energy they have. 
Maybe that's how 
 I can convince them. 
Maralyn, I'm going to go 
 out and check the trap. 
Okay. 
MITCHELL: 
 Kel is like the fisherman 
 of the group. 
He's very persistent 
 in that area, 
and part of me thinks 
it's because he feels 
 if he does catch a fish, 
that might, 
 um, keep him here longer. 
MARALYN: 
 Good luck. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
MARALYN: 
 There's a time to be energized,
and then there's a time 
 to just chill out. 
So we're going 
 to the family whirlpool. 
MARALYN: 
 This will feel so good.
You'll be in ecstasy. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
Look at us, 
just hanging out
 like we're on 
 vacation. 
This is great. 
KEL: 
 Our food strategy 
 right now is rice. 
I mean, rice is our staple. 
I don't see that rice 
 lasting us more than ten days. 
We do need to get some fish 
 out of this river. 
Our plan for getting food is, 
 uh... 
We don't really have 
 a good plan, actually. 
No fish. 
Are we worried 
if there's no fish 
in the water? 
I'm not worried. 
There ain't no fish 
 in this water, 
I'll tell you that. 
I say stop wasting the energy 
 on fishing. 
And I don't think there's any 
 fish out there. 
KEL: 
 We've got some great hooks 
 that were in the crate, 
but I don't have 
 any fishing line. 
And so what I've had to use 
 is twine, 
and twine, um, is not as 
 great as fishing line-- 
it breaks, you have 
 to weave it together 
to get through the hole. 
The fish can see it, obviously,
 and plus the twine floats, 
so I have to tie a rock 
to the twine 
 to make the twine sink, 
which makes it even more 
 noticeable to the fish. 
COLBY: 
 Kel's done a little 
 bit of fishing which just, 
I mean, come on, 
the guy couldn't fish 
a rubber ducky out of a bathtub.
The bait choices, 
 the-the lines... 
He's just going about it 
 the wrong way. 
KEL: 
 So I've been trying to fish 
 every day, 
and I've been unsuccessful, 
 but I'm not going to quit. 
I'm going to keep on doing it 
 and doing it and doing it 
until I can find 
 a great fishing spot 
or a technique that works. 
JERRI: 
 Believe me, when he goes out, 
I'm hoping more than anybody 
 that he's going 
to come back with some fish 
 and some shrimp, 
and he'll have 
 a big seafood buffet. 
Any luck out there? 
No, but there are fish 
 out there. 
I saw quite a few. 
JERRI: 
 But it's not happening. 
And it's... ( laughs ) 
He's just, he's not a 
 fisherman, obviously. 
He should keep his day job. 
( laughs ) 
JEFF V.: 
 Oh, wow. 
ALICIA: 
 Whoa. 
This is big time. 
It's a reward. 
There we go. 
"A leap of faith is 
 not for the skilled.
"Just step off the edge,
 try not to get killed. 
Like Sundance and Butch..."
( gasps ): 
We're jumping off 
a cliff. 
"...you'll jump 
 from a cliff. 
Count on your friends while 
 you're set adrift." 
You guys? 
We've got a big one. 
Did anybody see
 Sundance? 
We get two blankets 
 if we win. 
Oh, my gosh.
Feel it. 
 Two full-size blankets. 
How nice it'll be 
with blankets, man. 
ALICIA: 
Oh, my God. 
We'll definitely sleep 
 through the night 
if we have blankets.
KIMMI: 
 Everybody has to jump? 
You're jumping off a 
cliff, bad boy. 
JEFF V.: 
Can you jump 
off a cliff? 
Into what? 
Into water. 
"Step off the edge"?
 That's-that's... 
that's going over something. 
And we're off the edge. 
NICK: 
Yeah, I'm psyched. 
"And try not to get killed." 
Today's challenge is, 
 I believe, 
is probably going 
 to be jumping off a cliff 
into some water. 
Water is not my finest... 
 my uh, finest point, 
so, uh, I'm a little
 apprehensive. 
But, uh, I figure 
if the rest of them 
 can do it, I can, too,
so I'm going 
 to give it a shot.
We got your back. 
We got your back. 
Rodger is the 
only one that 
 I'm a little iffy about. 
I think everybody else is going 
 to go over it. 
But he can't swim. 
He can tread water, lightly. 
I just, basically, 
 learned to swim 
right before we came out here. 
Plus I'm... I really got a 
 little fear of heights, too. 
I mean, you're talking to a guy
that wouldn't even ride the 
 Ferris wheel at the fairs, 
'cause I just-just never did 
 like heights. 
What's up, guys? 
This is a reward challenge. 
It's called "Butch Cassidy" and 
you're playing 
 for two warm blankets. 
It is the rainy season. 
They're probably going 
 to come in handy. 
The game is this: 
There are two crates, 
 one for each tribe, 
anchored out in the water below.
Your challenge: 
Get your tribe's crate across 
 the finish line 
at the old miner's camp first. 
Winners keep the blankets 
 that are sealed inside. 
One member from each tribe, 
 on my start, 
is going to jump off this cliff,
they'll swim out and 
 grab on to the crate. 
And then the next member 
 will jump off and swim out. 
You can't jump until the person 
 in front of you 
has touched the crate. 
Once all the members 
 from the tribe have arrived, 
you've got to dive down, 
unhook the crate 
 from its anchor, 
and then swim with it 
 down the river 
through the rapids 
and make your way up the beach. 
First tribe to get their crate 
 onto the platform 
at the end wins the challenge 
 and the blankets. 
ALICIA: 
Let's go, Kucha, let's go. 
( indistinct conversations ) 
Just run and jump 
 and work magic. 
JEFF: 
 Survivors ready? 
Go! 
( excited shouting, whooping ) 
( screaming ) 
JEFF V.: 
 Go, Mike, go! 
MITCHELL: 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
JEFF V.: 
 Go left, Mike, go left! 
( excited shouting ) 
Go, Mike! 
 Go, Mike! 
COLBY: 
 That a way, Mitchell! 
 Go, Mitch, go! 
MARALYN: 
 Come on, Mitchell! Go! 
( laughter ) 
 Oh, my God! 
Go...!
( excited shouting continues ) 
( excited shouting continues ) 
Good job! Go! Go! Go! 
( laughter ) 
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on, Rodger!
Let's go, man! 
( excited shouting continues ) 
Come on, Rodger. Let's go, man! 
( others continue shouting ) 
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, Rodger! 
Come on, Rodger! 
Come on, Rodger, you can do it! 
Come on, Rodger! 
You can do it! 
You can do it, Rodger! 
Let's go. 
 Here we go.
( indistinct shouting ) 
ALICIA: 
 Ready? Go. 
Come on. 
JEFF V.: 
 Did you get it? 
I got it. 
 Go! Go! 
ALICIA: 
 Go! Go! 
Good job. Pull! 
Go to the right! 
Go to the right! 
Go to the right! 
Go to the right! 
ALICIA: 
 Nobody gives up, 
 nobody gives up. 
ELISABETH: 
 Go, Kucha! 
Oh, my God. 
ELISABETH: 
 Hang right! Hang right! 
( indistinct shouting )
( panting ) 
( all talking and panting 
 at once ) 
ALICIA: 
 Guys, get those... 
AMBER: 
 Oh, the sand's so hot! 
( indistinct talking ) 
( grunts ) 
Nice job, guys. 
 Way to go, guys. 
One, two, three. 
( whooping ) 
( panting, sighing ) 
 AMBER: 
 Good job, guys. 
I'm glad that's over. 
You swam more than 
you've ever swum 
in your life. 
JEFF: 
Guys, open that crate up-- 
 blankets inside. 
All right! 
 Oh, yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Okay, you guys are 
on a hot streak-- two in a row. 
( birds chirping ) 
JERRI: 
 I want to sleep one good night.
COLBY: 
 Did you sleep good last night? 
No. 
COLBY: 
 Neither did I. 
MARALYN: 
 You know, all it takes is one 
small mound in the ground 
to really screw 
 with your body bad. 
TINA: 
 You know, we're not getting 
 eight hours' sleep. 
We're not getting... you know, 
 but a handful of food a day. 
But, you know, this is the game 
 we signed up to play. 
You guys hungry? 
Are you cooking? 
AMBER: 
 Keith says he's a chef, but... 
and it's not that 
 I don't believe that 
he can't cook very well, 
 you know? 
I'm not doubting his talent. 
But I think it might be 
 that he's adding 
maybe too much water 
 to the rice. 
TINA: 
 It's pasty. 
 It tastes like glue. 
It just... in your mouth, 
it goes ( smacking lips ) 
It's just horrible, 
 and I can't eat it. 
It just... 
 it didn't make sense. 
It didn't make sense. 
Like, how could a gourmet chef 
not know how to make rice? 
There's a bunch more things 
 we can have than rice, 
and I'm ready to start making 
 some of them. 
I remembered that 
 with flour and water 
you can create 
 some sort of dough. 
You know what we can do 
 while you're doing that? 
We're gonna go get 
 some more wood. 
All right. 
 So we'll be back 
 in a little while. 
JERRI: 
 Keith is very threatened 
 by the fact 
that I made this tortilla 
 this morning. 
That's why... 
I heard them 
 when they went up on the hill, 
and they were gathering wood, 
 and he was talking again 
about what he's gonna to do 
 with the rice 
and the vegetables 
 and this, and... 
you know, 
 you just have to laugh. 
You just have to laugh. 
 ( giggling ) 
So there's so much work to do 
 as a team that, uh... 
and it's hard, physical labor 
 to come up here 
and grab all these big logs 
 and stuff and throw them down. 
So if she wants to cook 
 some tortillas for breakfast, 
I think it's fantastic. 
Actually, 
 it's a break for me, you know? 
( chuckles ): 
 No... no worries, mate. 
JERRI: 
 I felt a little bit bad 
 about it, 
but at the same time, you know, 
 I felt like it was time 
for somebody to come in 
 and take charge 
and change the food situation. 
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Oh, my God, it is so good. 
Thank you. 
 Ah, you're 
 welcome. 
AMBER: 
 I love it!
I love it. 
We will eat today. 
Slap me five. 
TINA: 
 Jerri's gonna 
 take that job over, 
which I hope doesn't hurt 
 Keith's feelings. 
You know, I mean, 
 that's his area, 
and it's kind of 
 a slap in the face. 
Thanks, Jerri. 
 JERRI: 
 Today's communion. 
Wow. 
The finest restaurant 
 in the world 
couldn't make those that nice. 
JERRI: 
 Keith has gone out of his way 
to compliment me a lot now, 
to, like, try and smooth 
 the edges. 
And I see... I mean, 
 I see right through it. 
I don't... 
 I don't think his compliments 
are necessarily very genuine. 
That is good. 
I'm so glad 
 they put wheat in there. 
JERRI: 
 You know, the morale 
 right now is kind of low, 
but I think the tortilla 
made everybody spark up, 
so I'm really stoked about that.
And I got a few other tricks 
to pull out of my sleeve. 
MICHAEL: 
 I want to bring food today. 
If I can keep providing food, 
I absolutely am sure 
 I will make the merger. 
If I can't, 
 I become vulnerable. 
I've been thinking a lot 
 about the fact that 
at Tribal Council 
it came out 
 that I was the leader, 
and I don't really want 
 to be seen as the leader. 
So if I can get something, 
I'll lay real low 
 on the other leadership areas 
and just be the food guy. 
We got fish! 
It looks like you just went 
to the fish market 
 with all that fish. 
ALICIA: 
 Look at that! 
Who's better than you right now?
There's nobody I can think of. 
JEFF V.: 
 When other people catch a fish,
they just catch a fish, 
 but when Mike catches it, 
there are trumpets that blare 
 and angels that sing. 
And, you know, everybody's got 
to sit down and gather round him
and hold his hands 
 and watch him carve it out. 
Ow. Here you go. 
ALICIA: 
 Wow! 
MICHAEL: 
Dear God, You know I said 
 a lot of prayers today, 
and You answered them 
with fish for us. 
And I am so happy to be able 
to provide fish for the troops. 
I know that this could easily 
 get turned around in some way 
to make me be 
 the leader of the tribe, 
but this meal is, 
 from the bottom of my heart, 
makes me so happy to be able 
 to provide for everybody here. 
So... thanks for that. 
Amen. 
Amen. 
Good job. 
KIMMI: 
 Mike thanked God for making him
 the leader of the tribe. 
I don't know when 
 he was anointed, but... 
apparently, my back was turned 
 at that moment. 
Oh, my God.
Well, get you 
another bite. 
No, no, no. Take one bite 
 and keep passing it. 
RODGER: 
 Michael does like to be 
in the limelight-- 
 I don't think 
there's any doubt about that. 
But as long as Mike keeps 
 delivering the food, 
though, that's gonna be 
a hard one to knock off, 
 you know. 
He really thinks 
 he is leader of this tribe. 
I'm telling you now that 
 there are people in this tribe 
that want to vote him off 
 already. 
MARALYN: 
 I am very disappointed 
at what happened 
 five minutes ago. 
Jerri reported 
 to the rest of us 
that she had seen Kel 
 chewing a brown substance-- 
what she thought was beef jerky.
And I saw him put something 
 in his mouth, 
and it was, like, 
 dark brown colored, 
shredded looking sort of thing. 
Jerri blatantly said that 
 she saw something 
that looked 
 just like beef jerky 
go into his mouth, and I... 
 I believe her, actually. 
I guarantee it was.
AMBER: 
 I saw him chewing... 
I saw him chewing, too. 
JERRI: 
 I mean to have your own 
 team member possibly be 
holding food behind you 
and surviving on their own 
 little private stash 
while the rest of us are... 
 starving, 
basically, is not a good way 
 to start off on the right foot 
with a bunch of strangers. 
Because to think that someone 
 in our own tribe would be, 
you know, sneaking
 in extra stuff, 
 especially food. 
Well, if you're eating anything 
 that we aren't eating, 
then that's unfair 
 to the rest of us. 
If he had beef jerky... 
I'd kill him, dead. 
MARALYN: 
 The pot starts to boil. 
While Kel was up on the hill, 
 they rifled through his bag. 
TINA: 
 You know, it was like 
 a big feeding frenzy. 
You know, "Kel's got 
 beef jerky," and they said, 
"Look in his backpack 
 real quick," 
and I was standing right there, 
 and I did it. 
And there wasn't anything 
 in there at all. 
But still and yet, 
all I was thinking about, 
 "If I find beef jerky in here, 
it's gonna to be ugly." 
COLBY: 
 He's snacking up there, 
 I know it. 
( scattered chuckling ) 
MARALYN: 
 Ouch. 
Within earshot of Kel, 
it was overheard, 
and Kel came back down. 
KEITH: 
 Hey, Kel. 
 How you doing? 
How are you? 
 Good. 
Hey, guys? 
MARALYN: 
Did you find anything? 
How are you guys doing? 
Did you find anything? 
Just a second,
 just a second.
How are you
 guys doing?
Look, while I was going 
 up there looking for bait 
for fishing, you guys were 
 talking about that you thought 
I was eating beef jerky.
That was a blade of grass,
and I smooshed it 
 up into my jaw, 
and I was chewing 
 on that. 
I was just 
 chewing grass.
JERRI: 
 Well, in order to put grass 
 in your mouth, 
you have to go get grass first. 
And I don't think you get grass 
 out of your pocket. 
JERRI: 
What kind of grass? 
Green grass. Just 
 any kind of grass 
 you can pick up. 
AMBER: 
 How do you know 
 it's not poisonous? 
Uh, I mean, it looks... it looks
 like normal grass, okay? 
It just looks like a normal 
 blade of grass, so I mean... 
KEITH: 
We don't need you, 
uh, sick 
at these competitions. 
 Well, I want to just
make sure that 
 you guys know that.
I'm really trying to be 
 a part of this group. 
It's really important to me 
 to try to assimilate. 
I mean, I may not be 
the most talkative one in here. 
I'm a fairly quiet person... 
Mm... 
KEITH: 
 Well, thanks for coming 
 and telling us. 
Yeah, we appreciate
 the explanation. 
KEL: 
 No problem. 
We're-we're just, 
 you know, 
when someone's 
 chewing something 
and nobody else is and
 everybody's starving. 
KEL: 
 Well, I just find it 
 really comical 
that you would think 
 I would do that. 
MARALYN: 
 I think it's pretty comical, 
 actually. 
KEL: 
 I think it's comical myself. 
( scattered chuckling ) 
KEL: 
 And that also brings
 up another point-- 
I was going to do this
 later on tonight. 
I know during 
 the competition,
you guys were talking about 
your faces were getting scruffy,
and the girls were talking about
wanting to shave
 their legs. 
I've got three blades 
 out here. 
The girls can use one blade, the
 guys can use the other blade. 
I have no problem with that 
 whatsoever. 
JERRI: 
 He suddenly, at that point, 
offered his razor. 
And I think that that's 
 the hugest sign of guilt 
is to give to the people 
who have just accused you 
of something 
 that is very serious. 
I will totally 
take you up on that. 
That's very gracious 
 of you, actually. 
KEL: 
 No problem.
Sorry for the awkward moment. 
I will now leave 
 you guys in peace,
and I'll go in my boat and 
 try finding some kind of fish 
with the bait I have. 
MARALYN: 
 I suggested to them all, 
"Hey, what you all did 
 was totally inappropriate. 
"It was wrong. 
Nobody had any right 
 to go into Kel's bag." 
I said, "Don't you think 
that it would be in the best 
 interest of the team 
to be big enough 
 to apologize to him?" 
Without real proof, 
it would be very big of us 
to apologize. 
No. 
Okay. 
They said, "No. No." 
( laughing ) 
JERRI: 
 I think-I think Maralyn 
 was kind of upset at us.
Yeah. 
MARALYN: 
 Gee whiz. 
Four days, things are heating up
 at our encampment. 
It's on a bone.
Oh, boy. 
"Want to try a new dish? 
 Take care what you wish. 
"The next challenge 
 may go too far. 
"Just say 'Rub-A-Dub-Dub, 
thank God for the grub.' 
Close your eyes, plug your nose 
 and swallow hard." 
We're eating. 
We're eating bugs. 
We're eating 
 something crazy.
We got this one.
We're eating bugs. 
We're eating something.
We should've just been 
really hungry this morning. 
Food is food, right?
What kind of bug? 
MICHAEL: 
It's a worm. 
ALICIA: 
 It's grub.
It's grub. 
No, it's not a worm. 
NICK: 
 You guys want 
 to hear it? 
Yeah. 
You guys ready to hear this? 
It's on a bone. 
KIMMI: 
 Our immunity challenge 
 came to us 
and it's something 
 about "rub-a-dub-dub, 
we're eating a grub" 
 or something. 
( exaggerated retch ) 
Let me go last. 
I'm a vegetarian, 
which means I don't eat 
 land-dwelling animals. 
I'm not going to compromise my,
 you know, situation, um, now. 
I'm not eating amphibian. 
I'm not eating reptile. 
I'm not eating mammal. 
I'm not eating fowl. 
ALICIA: 
 Kimmi's not going 
 to compromise her morals. 
But coming into a game 
 like this, 
you can't come in with 
 a whole list of things 
you're not going to do 
 and you're not going to eat 
because you're not 
 helping your tribe, 
you're not helping 
 your team morale. 
Yeah, God. 
MICHAEL: 
 If Rodger can jump off a cliff 
and swim that long distance 
and down the rapids 
 with never having swum before, 
I think Kimmi should be able 
 to reach down 
and be able to do this. 
( sighs ): 
 Oh, my God.
KIMMI: 
 You know what, 
 I can't do it, 
and I'm disappointing six 
 people that are rooting for me.
Now, you know, 
I have no excuse for-for not 
being, um, voted off the island.
I could be gone, 
 just like that. 
JEFF: 
 I'll take the immunity idol. 
It's back up for grabs. 
I'll explain the game. 
I know you guys are hungry, 
 so we've put together 
one of the finest samplings 
 of true Aboriginal food, 
what they call bush tucker. 
As you guys know, 
 the Aboriginals 
have lived out here 
 for thousands of years, 
literally by eating everything. 
Nothing goes to waste. 
Here's how it's going to work. 
One member from each tribe 
 will come up. 
I'll spin the wheel, 
 and you'll eat what's on here. 
Also on the wheel, 
some treats that might go down 
 a little easier. 
If you're lucky, maybe you'll 
get the fruit or the candy bar. 
Since Kucha is short one member,
one of your members 
 will have to eat twice. 
So whoever you select to go 
 first, will also eat last. 
Now if you pass, and you don't 
 eat or you can't finish, 
you lose a point. 
At the end of one round, 
whoever has the most points 
 get the immunity idol. 
Losers lose another member at 
tomorrow night's Tribal Council.
Going down and coming back up 
 doesn't count. 
It's got to stay down. 
And the way you know 
is you show me your mouth. 
I look in, I don't see anything,
 I'll say "good to go." 
This is mangrove worm. 
It lives in little 
 mangrove trees. 
It usually burrows a small hole 
 in its infancy stage, 
and then as it grows, 
the hole gets deeper 
 and deeper and deeper, 
sort of like a termite. 
What are you taking out? 
I'm ready. 
You're taking out your teeth. 
( scattered chuckling ) 
Mad Dog has just 
 taken out her teeth. 
Work your magic, Mad Dog. 
Oh, my God. 
JEFF: 
 Here we go, guys. 
Three, two, one. 
You're on. 
AMBER: 
 Go, Maralyn!
JEFF: 
 Let's see. 
Good. 
( choking ) 
Come on, Maralyn. 
You can do it. 
You can do it. 
It's an oyster. 
 It's an oyster. 
JEFF: 
 Got a bucket 
 if you need it, Maralyn. 
You got it. 
 Water? 
JERRI: 
You got it. 
( coughing ) 
It's all right. 
( huffing ) 
JERRI: 
Yeah! 
( whooping )
Oh! 
JEFF: 
 Next two. 
( yells ) 
KIMMI: 
Brain. 
JEFF: 
 You got cow brain there. 
The good news 
 is it's pretty fresh. 
It should have 
 a nice taste to it. 
You guys ready for this? 
Sure. 
Come on, Keith. 
Three, two, one. 
 We're on. 
I can't. 
I can't eat a brain. 
Can we have some to take back 
 to camp with us? 
MITCHELL: 
 Yeah, Keith!
AMBER: 
 You are the man.
MITCHELL: 
 You the man, dude!
KIMMI: 
I can't do it. 
JEFF: 
Taking a pass, Kimmi? 
It's a mammal. 
I can't do it. 
Sorry. 
Okay. Let's see your mouth. 
You're good. 
Ogakor is one up. 
AMBER: 
 Yo, Keith!
Next two. 
That's mud whelk. 
It's that shellfish 
 you find seaside. 
Three, two, one. 
 We're on. 
AMBER: 
Oh, that's nice. 
COLBY: 
Atta-girl. 
That's it. 
Just swallow it. 
You've got to savor it. 
Kind of crunchy, huh, Jerri? 
Mm. 
Let's get that thing down, Nick.
ALICIA: 
 Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, hold it,
 hold it, hold it. 
Hold it.
JEFF: 
 I'll give you five seconds. 
 Five... 
four... 
three, two, one. 
AMBER: 
Come on, Jerri. 
JEFF: 
 Look at that. 
All right! 
( screams happily ) 
All right! 
( yells happily ) 
JEFF: 
 Next two. 
 Kel and Elisabeth. 
You got the apple. 
Wow! 
Yeah! Yeah! 
Oh, my God. 
You want a bite? 
JEFF: 
 Next two. 
MARALYN: 
 Whatever it is,
 you got it. 
D-oh! 
JEFF: 
 That is witchety grub larva. 
This will become a moth. 
It's in its early stages. 
Ogakor you got a lead. 
Three, two, one. 
Come on, Mitchell.
Yummy, yummy. 
Whoa! 
Go, Mitchell! 
 Go, Mitchell! 
( laughing and cheering ) 
Way to go, all right! 
JEFF: 
 Here we go. 
JERRI: 
You can do it, Amber. 
( groans ): 
 Ah! You suck. 
JEFF: 
The pinchers, you can break off.
Everything else, you're eating. 
Three, two, one. 
Go, baby. 
TINA: 
Eat it little by little, 
if you have to. 
( all talking at once ) 
COLBY: 
There you go. 
All right. 
Chips. 
 Potato chips. 
Ranch potato chips.
( all talking at once ) 
Ranch potatoes. 
JERRI: 
You got it. 
Okay, you got it. 
 Swallow, swallow. 
JEFF V.:
 Yeah! 
Don't... 
don't think about 
what's going through
 your head right now.
It's a mental picture.
Look at the candy bar. 
Look at the candy bar. 
KEITH: 
All right! 
( cheering ) 
COLBY: 
Yeah! 
Good job. 
JEFF: 
 Here we go, guys. 
Big bucks, big bucks. 
 No whammies. 
Ooh, get past that. 
( cheering ) 
Rodger!
JEFF: 
 It's a candy bar. 
Life is working for you guys. 
MITCHELL: 
Go ahead, man. 
You enjoy it. 
We're with you in spirit. 
JEFF: 
 Last two. 
Tina, Michael, you're up again. 
Here's where we're at. 
Kimmi passed. 
Therefore, Kucha is down 
 one point. 
Tina, if you swallow 
 this last one, 
your team wins immunity. 
But if you don't and Michael 
 swallows his, we have a tie. 
This is it, for immunity. 
Perfect. Yeah. 
JEFF: 
 You got tripe, 
 a cow's stomach lining. 
Oh, Tina, 
 that's the best one.
JERRI: 
 Steak. 
 That's a steak.
Steak. 
That's a sirloin. 
Three, two, one. 
 We're on. 
JERRI: 
Prime rib, baby. 
Prime rib. 
Prime rib, 
prime rib.
It's chewier 
than you would expect. 
It's prime rib. 
( indistinct talking ) 
It's okay, Tina. 
JEFF: 
 Okay? 
Yeah, baby! 
 You're good, 
 Tina, you're good.
( gags ) 
 You're getting
 protein. 
Slimy cow lining. 
Let's go, girl. 
( gags ) 
 Nutritious lining.
Slimy cow lining. 
AMBER: 
 Cover your mouth. 
JEFF: 
 You got a bucket, 
 you got a bucket. 
It came up. 
It came up. 
( retching )
It's all right. 
No thing, no big thing. 
Oh! Sorry, guys. 
( cheering ) 
All right, guys, 
here's how the tiebreaker 
is going to work. 
Ogakor, you select 
 a member from Kucha.
Kucha, you select your member 
 from Ogakor. 
ALICIA: 
 Tina's up. 
JEFF: 
 Tina? 
Tina's up. 
Right here,
 Kimmi? 
Kimmi. 
Kimmi, 
 your challenge
is going to be to take
 a whole mangrove worm.
ALICIA: 
 This is all you, girl.
The first person to 
 completely swallow it, 
show me 
 their mouth,
that it's empty, wins.
( all talking at once ) 
( chanting ): 
 I can eat a worm. 
I can eat a worm. 
Three, two, one, go. 
ALICIA: 
 Swallow 
 the whole thing.
Pick it up.
She dropped it. 
Eat it, eat it.
You got it. 
( all talking at once ) 
( cheering ) 
Kimmi, come here. 
Immunity for Kucha. 
( cheering ) 
TINA: 
 I'll definitely 
 feel bad 
about having to vote 
 somebody off. 
There's some humiliation 
 involved 
with being the first 
 one voted off. 
KEITH: 
 You know, it's a bittersweet 
 opportunity. 
Actually, it's a bitter 
 opportunity. 
There is no sweetness to it. 
We have to eliminate a person 
 within our group. 
It could be me. 
I mean, 
 it really could be me. 
For all I know, I could be 
 the individual going. 
MITCHELL: 
 Keith is, um, he's 
 a bit bossy. 
He's very condescending, 
and he's definitely... 
 close to going. 
COLBY: 
 If you were looking to 
 paint a bull's-eye on someone, 
obviously Keith has struck 
 a nerve in a few people. 
But also Jerri. 
She's certainly, um, 
a very strong girl 
and very set in her ways. 
Really? 
Sometimes a little 
 unforgiving in certain areas. 
No, no, no, no. 
 We're going to talk right now. 
COLBY: 
 So that kind of makes 
 her a point of friction 
to some people. 
Some things that, uh, 
 that she's done 
have really made me... 
 me bristle. 
( laughing ) 
KEL: 
 At this point I'm going 
to vote for Jerri. 
And the reason why I'm going to 
 vote for Jerri 
is because I've already 
 told Maralyn 
that I was going 
 to do that, 
and I'm not going 
 to break my word. 
And Maralyn told me she was 
 going to vote for Jerri, too. 
And I trust Maralyn. 
I think Kel is a liar 
 and a cheat. 
And as much as I don't want 
to believe that 
 to be the truth, 
he would probably be the first 
 one I would want to vote off. 
I'm ready to go. 
MITCHELL: 
 I think the name of the game 
is trust no one. 
I don't think you could trust 
your own grandparents out here.
I mean, I think I would vote 
them right off just 'cause 
they've been married 
 for 50 years. 
That's a good alliance. 
KEITH: 
 This game is all about 
 deceit, deception 
and how to play using 
 your mind to win. 
JEFF: 
 All right, guys, we 
 begin Tribal Council 
with a ritual. 
I would like you to go ahead 
and grab a torch... 
and approach the flame. 
Dip your torches in, 
and once they're lit, 
you can put them 
 back in their slot. 
We do this because 
fire does represent life. 
These torches will now 
represent your life, your 
 identity at Tribal Council. 
I haven't had a chance 
to talk to you guys 
 at Tribal Council yet, 
so just a few questions 
before we get to the vote. 
You have fire. 
You have 
a professional chef. 
You guys should be 
eating very well. 
KEITH: 
 You know what, until 
 we start really sourcing
great products to work with, 
our creative juices are 
 semi-limited and stuff. 
But we realized earlier we had 
 flour, 
and Jerri is 
 a phenomenal cook,
so she steps in
 and she's 
 made tortillas.
We've had those
 for breakfast 
 every morning. 
When we're done, we have Jerri's
tortillas shop opening up. 
JEFF: 
Why are you cooking 
if he's the chef? 
( Jerri sighs ) 
I knew you were going 
 to go there. 
The rice was 
a little pasty 
the first couple of nights, 
 and it got to the point 
where none of 
us wanted to eat it, 
and that's when I felt 
 I needed to step in 
because we were losing strength.
Our morale was down. 
I mean, when you don't want 
to even eat, 
that's a really bad 
sign 
of bad things to come. 
So I just took it upon myself. 
Colby, what was your 
reaction to Keith's food? 
Oh, I had no problem 
 with it. 
Rice is rice, man. 
I'd go along
 with that. 
Jeff... if it-if
 it goes down 
and doesn't 
 come back up, 
it's a good meal. 
Exactly. 
That's what we found 
 out yesterday. 
( Amber and Jerri groaning ) 
Tina, what's been 
your lowest low? 
Probably throwing up 
that intestines that I ate 
and feeling like 
 I let my team down. 
So let me ask you 
the question that is 
 most on my mind: 
Do you feel like you 
need to say, 
"I know I screwed up, 
 but guys, here's why 
you should keep me"? 
 Absolutely not. 
I feel like I-I'm the one who 
 screwed up, 
I should be the one to go. 
Having said that, 
 it is time to vote. 
Jerri, you're first. 
Nothing against you, Jerri, 
 but I already promised Tina 
and Maralyn that I would 
not vote against them, 
and I would vote 
for you. 
I made this on day one, and I 
 don't break my promises. 
Sorry about that, Jerri. 
MITCHELL: 
 As much as we could 
 use your strength 
in our challenges, 
we're a little sick and tired 
 of some of your games. 
The only comfort I have in 
 voting this way 
is the fact that you brought 
 this on all by yourself. 
I'm sorry. 
MARALYN: 
 Kel. 
Kel, if you were lying 
 in the Simpson Desert, 
dying of thirst, 
every single one of us would 
give you a drink of water. 
Good luck to you. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked to 
 leave the Tribal Council area 
along this bridge. 
The first vote... 
Kel. 
Jerri. 
Kel. 
That's three votes 
for Kel, 
one for Jerri. 
Four votes Kel. 
The first person voted out 
of the Ogakor tribe... 
Kel. 
Kel, I need you 
to bring me your torch. 
Kel, the tribe has spoken. 
Go get 'em. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Well, you survived Tribal 
 Council number one. 
You have a long walk home. 
Go ahead 
and grab your torches 
and head back to camp. 
See you tomorrow. 
Stay tuned for scenes from 
 our next episode. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Jerri makes her move on Colby. 
JERRI: 
 He's a cowboy, 
and I'm such 
 a sucker for cowboys. 
COLBY: 
 Just two school kids 
 on the playground 
having fun. 
JEFF: 
 At Kucha, Michael is obsessed 
with making a kill... 
MICHAEL: 
 This is a pig killer. 
...causing tempers to flare. 
JEFF V.: 
 That stupid spear. 
 That's classic Mike. 
He's an idiot. 
( laughing ) 
I knew right from day one 
 that it was going to be hard 
for me to fit in. 
I'm a military guy, 
and the people I was 
 working with 
are very unique, special type 
 of people. 
It was going to be very hard 
 for me 
to fit into that mixture. 
I tried, I really did. 
But I don't think 
 in a couple of days 
I could have overcome 
 our differences. 
Good luck. 
You're all winners to me.
