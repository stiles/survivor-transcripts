         JEFF: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
 the former Kucha Tribe, 
outnumbered 
 by Ogakor's alliance, 
fought to stay alive 
by exploiting 
 the tribe's disdain for Jerri. 
I think there's 
 a crack in their
 tribe right now.
Jerri... 
I think she's going to get votes
from their tribe. 
JEFF: 
 Jerri won the reward challenge 
 and chose Amber 
to share in her victory... 
while back at camp, 
 Barramundi had 








their own celebration 
 without them. 
KEITH: 
What's missing? 
What's making it feel that way? 
The Wicked Witch of the West 
 isn't here. 
( laughing ) 
JEFF: 
 Keith won immunity 
for the second time in a row. 
( crashing ) 
The tribe hiked 
to Tribal Council 
 in a torrential rainstorm... 
Alicia. 
...where the former 
Kucha members learned 
that Ogakor's alliance 
 was still strong. 
The tribe has spoken. 








Alicia was voted out, 
becoming the first member 
 of the jury. 
Eight are left. 
 Who will be the next to go? 
? ? 
COLBY: 
 Last night, it was just... 
tossing and turning all night. 
The floor of the tent 
 was uncomfortable. 
When the rain started coming in,
 I was on the end. 
Started getting some water flow
 in my side of the tent, 
just draining off the tarp that
 we lay on, and then wake up 
to see the rain like this, 
 our fire's out. 
It's going to be a long day. 
JERRI: 
 Right now my main concern 
is staying dry, 
 'cause I don't want 
to get cold. 
So I'm just feeling 
kind of drained 
and lazy right now, so... 
I'm sleeping in. 
ELISABETH: 
 Beautiful day 
 in the neighborhood. 
RODGER: 
 Yeah, maybe it'll clear off. 
Maybe it'll only rain 
 half the day. 
AMBER: 
 I hope our sunny days 
 aren't completely gone, though.
The rainy season
 is upon us. 
KEITH: 
They don't call me 
"fireman" for nothing. 
Look at that. Look at that. 
The physical work is not... 
 it's not light. 
You got to go get wood. 
 You got to break it down. 
You got to keep 
 the fire going. 
( sighs ) 
And life in the outback 
 is tough, 
and it's getting tougher. 
It really is getting tougher 
 for everybody. 
( Nick gargling ) 
What are you doing, Nick? 
I swear, every time I swallow, 
 my th-throat just burns. 
The roof of my mouth feels 
like it's been burned 
 for the last three days. 
You have large 
taste buds? 
Enlarged. 
Wow. 
NICK: 
 I had en... like, three 
or four enlarged taste buds 
 on my tongue, 
which just is terrible. 
And I'm feeling better, 
 but my mouth is still raw, 
so I can't 
even drink water normally. 
It's just, like, ugh. 
Sure doesn't look like 
the spring water from home. 
RODGER: 
That looks dirty. 
That's 'cause the 
 river's so muddy. 
If it's been boiled,
 then I'll drink it. 
Well... 
 We're out of water.
Well, we better... 
we need to definitely 
boil up some water. 
 Just dump it. 
Just dump it and
 get some more. 
 Yeah. 
TINA: 
 The rain settled in here, 
 and it muddied our water, 
and it's so cloudy that fishing 
has not been good at all. 
We've lost all but two 
 of our hooks 
because we have to fish 
 from shore, 
and there's a lot of debris 
 on the bottom. 
RODGER: 
Tina, would you come down here? 
I'm going to have to get out 
 in the water. 
I've got a line hung up. 
You got a line hung? 
RODGER: 
Yeah, about two feet 
offshore here. 
The water's 
 just so much muddier. 
Of course, I'm taking a chance 
 on losing my hook in here. 
I do know that. 
Let me poke this way, 
 just right in there... 
Maybe tomorrow-- 
 we got a full day--
maybe the water'll 
clear up a little bit... 
 Yeah. 
...and try to get 
 some fish in. 
Something besides rice. 
COLBY: 
 Because we're not having 
 the fish, 
we're having to rely 
 on our rice. 
We're eating a lot more rice 
 than... maybe we should be. 
We're down to about two 
 or three days' supply 
at the rate we're going. 
We still have eight people 
 to feed. 
Keith, you want
 me to start 
the rice in 
 ten minutes?
KEITH: 
Yeah, if Jerri's up 
for that. 
Or we could do the two cups 
 of rice-- it doesn't matter. 
Maybe go back 
 to the two cups.
JERRI: 
One more meal of rice 
is all we have left. 
At the most. 
Ooh. 
Oh, my gosh, I knew
it was going to 
 be something fun. 
A rope ladder. 
( whispering ):
 Oh, my gosh. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Hey, guys, you 
 guys are going 
 to dig this one.
It's going to be 
a good one. 
They have upped 
 the ante. 
It came 
on a rope ladder. 
It says, uh, "Mental or 
 physical, you never can tell, 
"but you'll need a partner, 
so you must pair up well. 
"One guy, one girl, 
one reward to split. 
If there's one reward to win, 
 then this one is it." 
( all exclaiming happily ) 
Wow! 
So we're splitting the reward, 
and this one's going 
 to be big and chunky. 
TINA: 
 A good one.
ELISABETH: 
 How do you guys 
 think we should 
 decide partners?
AMBER: 
I don't know-- should we 
pull 'em out of the hat? 
COLBY: 
You want to do that? 
I don't think so. 
ELISABETH: 
 You don't 
 want to pull
out of a hat? 
No. I think we should pick. 
ELISABETH: 
Who would you pick? 
JERRI: 
 I'd pick Colby.
TINA: 
Well, duh, 
who wouldn't? 
Well, the whole thing is, 
 you know, 
when did this game 
 start being fair? 
No, but I think 
it is about team-manship. 
RODGER: 
Oh, I'm-I'm 
the old guy here. 
I know nobody wants
 to be with me, 
but you know...
 Oh, Rodger, 
that's so not true. 
 Sometimes you just got 
 to go with the flow. 
TINA: 
How we going 
to do it, Colby? 
I've got all the guys' names 
 written on a piece of paper. 
Oh, that's a good idea. 
AMBER: 
And the girls pick? 
Yep. 
AMBER: 
 Don't open it yet, 
 until we all get one. 
TINA: 
 Did I get one?
Yep, you got it. 
Don't look at them yet. 
All right, 
you can look at 'em. 
AMBER: 
Keith, you're my partner! 
Nick, you're my partner. 
Colby. 
TINA: 
Oh, my goodness. 
ELISABETH: 
That's funny. 
( scattered chuckling ) 
 That's laughable. 
COLBY: 
Ready to rock? 
Yeah. 
Ironically enough, I ended up 
 being Colby's partner anyway. 
I think it's important 
 that people are 
constantly reminded of the 
reality of our situation. 
There is nothing fair 
 about this. 
And... you know, 
 it's about winning. 
Jerri said, "Well... 
 I don't want to draw names." 
Tina said, "Why not?" 
She said, "Well,
 I just think we 
 ought to pick." 
She said, 
 "Well, who would you pick?" 
She said, "Colby." 
I'm sitting there going, 
"Well, now, hold on, let's think
about who Colby 
 would pick here." 
Granted, I want 
 to win this thing,
but I don't know
 that I want 
to share with her 
 whatever it is. 
JEFF: 
Come on in, guys. 
Today's reward challenge 
is the biggest one yet. 
A helicopter's 
going to land 
at Barramundi Beach 
and take you to one 
of the Seven Wonders 
of the World: 
 the Great Barrier Reef. 
Oh, my gosh. 
JEFF: 
Where you'll go snorkeling 
in the clear blue water, 
and you'll be treated 
to a great lunch. 
The challenge is 
 an obstacle course. 
You and your partner 
 must stay together. 
There will be three heats 
 with two teams competing. 
It's simple elimination. 
 If you win, you advance. 
If you lose, you're out. 
The winners from the first two 
heats will move on to the final.
The winning team 
is going to the Reef. 
We've already drawn straws 
to see who's going 
to race first. 
You've picked your partners. 
 Let's go. 
Oh, my gosh.
JEFF: 
 This is heat number one. 
Winners move on 
 to the final round. 
Survivors ready? 
 Go! 
Nice job, Keith
 and Amber. 
Take a break. 
Heat number two! 
Winners will take on Amber 
 and Keith in the finals. 
Survivors ready? 
 Go! 
Way to go, Colby
 and Jerri. 
Final heat-- winners get 
 a private helicopter ride 
to the Great 
 Barrier Reef. 
Here we go. 
 Survivors ready? 
Go! 
? ? 
Are you okay, Keith? 
 Go, go. 
( Jerri groans ) 
Come on, pull! 
Hold on. 
 Ready? Ready? 
( Colby grunting ) 
Okay. 
 Go. 
No! Colby! 
 Go. 
( groans ) 
 Come on, come 
 on, come on. 
KEITH: 
 Go, go, go, go.
Hurry up! 
Go on, hurry up!
Hurry up, go. 
( Jerri cries out ) 
 JEFF: 
 It's tight. It's tight. 
You got it! Come on! 
( yells ) 
 COLBY: 
 You got it!
( Jerri yells ) 
Come on, Keith! 
Come on! 
( Jerri yells ) 
COLBY:
 Go on.
AMBER: 
 Come on, Keith!
That a girl. 
You guys are going to 
 the Great Barrier Reef.
AMBER: 
 Are you packing all your stuff?
JERRI: 
 Yeah, I'm going to get dressed,
'cause we don't have 
 any idea what time. 
KEITH: 
Colby left an hour ago. 
JERRI: 
 He did not.
They wouldn't do that. 
 That would be so cruel.
Yeah, that totally 
would be cruel. 
You guys are funny. 
He tried to wake you, 
 and you said no, 
you didn't want to go.
I thought for sure 
 they'd be here by now. 
AMBER: 
Me, too. 
( engine whining ) 
Did y'all eat yet? 
No. 
 Y'all could go 
 ahead and start. 
TINA: 
Well, you may be hungry 
before your trip. 
You've got a long way to go. 
But the helicopter is 
 going to be here any minute. 
( helicopter blades whirring ) 
( big yawn ) 
JERRI: 
 There's got to be 
 a little, little bit 
of animosity and jealousy from 
everyone else for winning 
 two rewards in a row. 
It bothers me a little bit 
'cause I can see where that 
 might affect people's voting. 
But on the other hand, 
I really couldn't give 
 a flying crap at this point. 
( laughing ) 
TINA: 
 Your limousine. 
Have fun. Y'all have... 
 y'all have fun. 
RODGER: 
Hope-hope you... hope you get...
( indistinct mutter ) 
We want details. 
 You'll get them. 
Make sure you remember
 everything you see. 
JERRI: 
 I will. 
I can't believe he
 just landed on our
 beach right there.
I know. 
 For you guys. 
So which of you two are coming 
 for a fly with me today? 
We are. 
 How you doing? 
Yeah, my name's Craig. 
Colby. Nice to 
 meet you, Craig. 
Colby. 
 Jerri. 
Jerri, how 
 are you doing?
JERRI: 
 Nice to meet you. 
Let's head out to the machine.
ELISABETH: 
Details! 
Details. Take note 
 of everything. 
I don't want 
 details. 
AMBER: 
 This is something 
 they're going to remember 
for the rest of their lives. 
I'll remember this
 thing today, too. 
Yeah, we will, too, 
but... 
Watching the 
 helicopter go away.
Well, the kids are 
 gone for a day trip. 
NICK: 
 Let's eat. 
Let's eat! 
 Let's eat. 
CRAIG: 
 We're getting over 
 level stuff now, 
we'll go down and have 
 a look at the trees, 
give you a bit of a close-up 
 look at the bush. 
All right! 
Yee-haw!
JERRI: 
We're in the middle of nowhere. 
Oh, yeah. As we'll be coming up 
 on the river there, 
we're going to track 
pretty much to the north, 
over some, um, 
 rugged outback stuff, 
so have a good look around 
 where you are. 
Sounds great. 
COLBY: 
 Oh, yeah! 
JERRI: 
 Whoo! 
I really got to get me 
one of these choppers. 
CRAIG: 
Nice waterfalls up ahead. 
JERRI: 
 Wow! 
CRAIG: 
Just a change of scenery. 
COLBY: 
 Just think, Jerri, 
we could be back on the beach 
eating rice right now. 
JERRI: 
It was meant to be, Colby. 
COLBY: 
Yeah, I'm getting excited. 
JERRI: 
 We land on the beach 
 and I see a boat sitting there.
I'm, like, "What is going on?" 
This is... 
It couldn't possibly 
 get any better. 
Whoo! 
I don't even want to think 
about anybody right now. 
No. No conversation about 
 strategy or Survivor today.
I can handle that. 
COLBY: 
 I told Jerri as soon 
 as we got in the boat, 
I said, "Here's the deal: 
 No talk about the game, 
no strategy, no talk 
about the other survivors. 
Let's just enjoy the day 
 for what it is: a day off... 
and that's it. 
Can't wait to get some 
salt water in my hair. 
Can't wait to get 
 some food in my belly.
( laughing ) 
Whoo! 
Oh... 
 Wow! 
no. 
( gasps ) 
Is that champagne?
Looks like champagne 
to me. 
Oh, my God! 
COLBY: 
Bottled water. 
JERRI: 
 Oh, my God!
Underwater cameras. 
Look at these. 
Unbelievable! 
Look at all this! 
We get under this tent 
 and there is just this spread. 
There's a basket full of all 
 different kinds of fruits, 
wrapped sandwiches, 
 a bag of Doritos... 
There's pasta salad 
 and sweet potatoes 
and all these 
 different vegetables. 
Look at this. 
 A day at the beach!
Look what 
you get here-- 
a little brownie. 
 ( gasps ) 
( screaming excitedly ) 
I know. Gol-ly! 
Where do we start? 
Where do we start? 
( laughing )
Perfect. 
I feel rather spoiled right now.
We got champagne over there. 
That'd be cool. 
But this one...
We don't need to have alcohol 
if we're going diving. 
( chuckling ):
 Sure we do. 
( cork pops ) 
JERRI: 
 We just... we feasted 
for a good while, 
 and then realized: 
"I wonder how 
everybody else is doing." 
But... I knew. 
( murmur of conversation ) 
AMBER: 
 Around camp, we just 
 kind of did, you know, 
daily chores and stuff. 
Keith and I went 
 and got some firewood 
and broke some firewood up. 
Just normal taking-care- 
 of-our-camp stuff, 
you know, and not too exciting,
but just enough to keep us busy
to make the day go by a little 
 bit faster with nothing to do. 
AMBER: 
 Oh, no... he only 
 said little things
like I think he's just 
 really enjoying himself.
Just... you know...
Why not?
( murmuring ) 
Just to get out of here and see
 one of the wonders of the world
would have been great, 
 you know. 
We're in the outback, 
 but we're seeing, you know, 
the same basic spot 
 over and over and over. 
So, uh, to get out and see some 
 really clear blue water 
and have a big meal, 
 it would've been great. 
JERRI: 
 Here we are in the middle 
 of the Great Barrier Reef. 
It was just too close 
 to paradise. 
The setting-- it was... 
it was very, very romantic, 
on top of everything else. 
I even looked at him 
 at one point and I was, like, 
"This is one hell of 
 a first date, Colby." 
( seabirds calling ) 
I couldn't have come out here 
with a better person than Colby.
We're having a great time. 
We're getting to know each other
outside of the game 
and outside of that environment.
This is basically the perfect 
honeymoon without the sex. 
COLBY: 
 Jerri was quite giddy 
 on our little getaway. 
Mmm! 
She made a comment to me 
about it being a honeymoon 
 without the sex, 
and it couldn't be farther 
 from the truth for me. 
I mean, we certainly didn't sit
 around and high-five and say, 
"Man, we finally get our time 
alone together," you know? 
That's not what 
 I was looking for. 
I was just looking for some 
 down time away from the game 
and that's what I got. 
( surf crashing ) 
COLBY: 
 I do not want to leave here. 
JERRI: 
 I don't, either. 
COLBY: 
 It's hard back on Barramundi 
 Beach, being out there 
26 days, going on a month, 
 and not have anything but rice,
so we're just going 
 to go back in 
and try to be as humble 
 as possible about it. 
If somebody pisses me off, 
then I'm going to just say, 
"I got to go snorkeling 
on the Great Barrier Reef. 
What did you 
do today?" ( laughing ) 
JERRI: 
 Returning to Barramundi 
 right now is... 
I'm not really 
 looking forward to it. 
But I, at least, am 
 going back feeling 
rejuvenated and renewed 
and a little bit more 
 like my true self, 
because, man, after 26 days 
 of putting on the game face 
and being this tough, you know, 
 don't-mess-with-me chick... 
I got a tender side, too. 
I feel like a little bit 
of that was touched today. 
KEITH: 
 Well, let's see what 
 this noise is here. 
That chopper 
 is definitely coming. 
Yep, there it is. 
 Here they are. 
ELISABETH: 
 Where? 
Right coming 
 over the trees.
( chopper roaring ) 
Right there. 
ELISABETH: 
There they are! 
ELISABETH: 
 Yeah. We want details. 
JERRI: 
 Oh, it was awesome. 
AMBER: 
 Your meal? 
 What was your meal? 
JERRI: 
Start out... 
COLBY: 
 Bananas, apples
 and oranges. 
Mmm... 
 Mmm... 
A couple of And a couple 
nectarines. of nectarines.
I wish everyone could 
 have come with us. 
ELISABETH: 
Good jump start. 
You got a jump start. 
But since you 
 Yeah. couldn't, 
I brought a little bit 
 of the reef back to you.
( laughter ) 
Everybody gets their 
 own piece of coral. 
Yay! 
 Oh! 
AMBER: 
How exciting! 
TINA: 
Wow. That's very nice 
of you to do, Colby. 
ELISABETH: 
Oh, my gosh! 
This is Rodger's. 
RODGER: 
Oh... Thank you. 
AMBER: 
Thank you so much! 
ELISABETH: 
Thanks. It's... 
COLBY: 
This one is Keith's, and it has 
a little empty space, kind of 
like the one between his ears. 
( uproarious laughter ) 
( laughing ): 
 There you go. 
Oh. 
Here's your, uh, 
 orange for Tennessee. 
RODGER: 
 Oh, man.
Oh, Colby,
 thank you!
JERRI: 
 Colby's little, um, 
 shell maneuver was 
most definitely strategy. 
For me, in a perfect world, 
it would be me and him 
 sitting up there 
in front of the jury. 
I find him and myself to be the
 most even on the playing field,
more than anybody else here. 
And so now, because of that 
little maneuver, I'm thinking...
that he's got one up 
 on me, for sure. 
TINA: 
 Thank you.
Colby, thank you so much. 
You're welcome. I wish 
 y'all could have been there. 
That was 
 so thoughtful.
AMBER: 
This is so cool! 
ELISABETH: 
It's so cool! 
Oh, wonder. 
RODGER: 
Back there. 
That's exactly... 
COLBY: 
 That's one of the seven 
 wonders of the world. 
RODGER: 
 Yeah. Yeah. Huh.
( seabird whistling ) 
NICK: 
 Hey, Keith, 
 can you grab the funnel? 
COLBY: 
 Immunity is going to determine 
 who goes next time, 
just like immunity determined 
who... who's going tonight. 
Nick comes over from Kucha, 
 and as Ogakor, 
we're still trying to maintain 
 some sort of control. 
We determined a long time ago 
that Nick was more of a threat 
than, say, Elisabeth and Rodger.
So that determines why 
 Nick goes before them. 
ELISABETH: 
 Suckers. 
That's it.
( clattering in box ) 
Oh, I need some water. 
Grasshopper's 
 in the box! 
KEITH: 
 Nick's a strong guy, 
although Nick's pretty much 
 had it. 
He's-he's burned out, 
and he says, 
 "Listen, I'm rea..." 
You know, I'm ready to go." 
So, I don't feel real bad 
 about that. 
ELISABETH: 
 I don't think we've 
 been alone together 
in a long time, 
 the three of us.
That's true. 
RODGER: 
 You're right. 
ELISABETH: 
The remaining 
Kucha survivors. 
RODGER: 
 This wind's blowing 
 right at ya. 
Yeah. 
ELISABETH: 
 Well, basically, Kucha's 
 outnumbered right now 
by Ogakor, and there's 
 a chance, one by one, 
we could go. 
I know Nick feels 
as if he's probably 
 the next to go 
out of our tribe, 
 but if he wins immunity, 
it could just as 
 easily be me or Rodger. 
If I don't win 
 the immunity challenge, 
I think I'm a goner. 
I'll go boil water. 
RODGER: 
 Well, maybe that's why. 
We slave away in 
the outback 
as our numbers fall. 
They know, they know... 
 They know that they got us. 
They know 
 they got us.
NICK: 
 Winning the immunity 
 challenge 
is important to stay alive. 
You know, you get out there, 
 and you try to compete 
and try to win immunity 
 challenges, 
but looks like everybody 
 is voting 
on tribal lines at this point. 
Wow. 
Oh, wow. 
Oh! 
"Those with good 
balance are in for a treat, 
"'cause now we find out... 
who's sure on their feet. 
"If you keep steady 
and don't rock the boats, 
you'll head to the Council, 
 safe from the votes." 
KEITH: 
 Today's the immunity 
 challenge. 
It's an important day 
 for everybody. 
The mail insinuated 
that we're standing there 
on some kind of a log structure,
I think it's going 
 to be in the water. 
I'll take this again. 
Yep. 
 Mr. Consistency.
Third time's 
a charm. 
Put it back on its perch. 
Are you predicting 
 another victory today? 
No, I don't... 
You're going to have
 to share the wealth.
Luck is on my side. 
 All right. 
Today's immunity challenge 
is going to test your balance, 
 not your strength. 
In fact, one of the keys 
is figuring out how to use your 
opponent's strength against them
to knock them off balance. 
There'll be three rounds. 
Each round's 
 a different challenge. 
It's single elimination. 
 Lose, you're out. 
Win, you move on. 
First round, you'll climb up 
 onto the towers, 
one against another, 
 and using a rope, 
you're going to try and knock 
your opponent off balance 
into the water. 
It's not a tug of war. 
You can pull on the rope, 
or if you want, just let it go. 
Next round, 
 you have a shaky beam. 
So, it's all about using your 
 legs and redistributing weight 
to get them forward 
 or backwards. 
Wow. 
 For the last round, 
the finalists will square off 
on a pair of unsteady platforms.
Wow. Cool. 
As always, Tribal 
 Council tonight, 
immunity at stake, 
certainly for one person. 
Big, big stakes tonight. 
Now, to be fair, 
you guys have already 
 randomly drawn names 
to decide who will compete 
 against one another 
in the first round. 
All right, let's do it. 
Keith, Rodger, you're up. 
Survivors ready!
Go! 
I love ya, but you got to go. 
Oh! 
Dog, you. 
Sneaky little 
 devil, ain't ya? 
( laughter ) 
( women screaming ) 
( applause and cheering ) 
Yeah! 
Rodger, moving on 
 to the next round. 
Whoo! 
Nick, Jerri, 
 grab your rope. 
JERRI: 
 Do we have to put our 
 wrist in this thing? 
Yep. 
Put it around 
 your neck. 
( laughs ) 
Survivors, ready? 
Go! 
RODGER: 
Oh. 
Did you see 
his foot come up? 
Oh! 
JEFF: 
Nick! 
Moving on to round two. 
Survivors ready? 
Ready-o! 
Go! 
JERRI: 
Better be careful. 
You know how 
 he treats women.
Oh! 
That was a quick one. 
Oh-ho. 
That was quick. 
Colby's moving on. 
Colby, you're cruel. 
( laughs ) 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Amber is an aggressive 
 little kitten. 
( women shrieking ) 
( all exclaim ) 
Amber, moving on! 
Good job. 
JEFF: 
 Okay, round two. 
Once again, you've randomly 
 chosen the names 
of your opponents. 
Here we go. 
Winner moves on to the finals 
 and a shot at immunity. 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Oh, oh, get it, Rodg! 
Get it, Rodg. 
Go, Rodger! 
Come on, Rodg. 
Kick it, Rodg. 
Kick it, Rodg. 
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 
( all scream ) 
Ah! 
Yeah, yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Colby, moving on! 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Whoo! Shake those 
things! 
They look like they're doing 
 some sort of strange dance. 
I can't quite do that 
like you can. 
Oh. Oh, oh. 
ALL: 
Whoa! 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Nick, moving on 
to the final round! 
This is it! 
For immunity. 
The only thing that can 
 guarantee your security 
at tonight's Tribal Council. 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Oh. 
 Ooh. Ooh! 
Yeah, baby! 
( applause and cheering ) 
Nick wins immunity! 
JEFF: 
 Way to go, Nick. 
Barramundi, see you tonight 
at Tribal Council. 
Yeah! 
Good job, buddy! 
I hope I didn't seal
 your fate. 
Hmm? 
I didn't seal 
 your fate. 
Well, you know... 
Could have been 
either one of us here. 
That's just the way 
 the old ball bounces. 
ELISABETH: 
 Uh-huh. 
AMBER: 
 It's weird, 
but I think 
they all just know, 
so they've come 
to accept it. 
So, I think 
it's totally... 
JERRI: 
 The main thing that's changing 
now that Nick has won 
 today's immunity 
is that we were all going 
to vote him off tonight. 
So, it was discussed 
on the walk back to camp 
who we would be voting 
 for instead. 
It was decided by the ex-Ogakor
 tribe that, um, 
Elisabeth would 
 be the next one to go. 
It made me scared 
 a little. 
I was, like... 
Yeah, yeah. 
Could be me or you. 
It could be.
AMBER: 
 The Tribal Council's 
 definitely never a place 
where I want to go. 
 I hate going every single time.
It's voting somebody off. 
It doesn't matter 
if you've been 
with that person the whole 
entire time 
 or only a couple days. 
It's still really hard to do. 
I definitely want to talk to, 
 you know, Jerri and Colby 
and Tina and Keith tonight 
 to see if our original plan's 
still in effect. 
The plan was kind of just get 
rid of Kucha one by one by one. 
You guys are 
pretty much in control, 
you know that 
'cause of your numbers. 
And, I mean, I... 
My next vote 
 would be for Jerri, anyway. 
I think that she just brings 
people down, 
and I don't like 
how she is to even people 
on her own tribe. 
Her allegiance 
is only to herself. 
Mm-hmm. 
 But we have to vote 
 you or Rodger off. 
Mm-hmm. 
Because that's 
 the safe thing to do. 
Right. 
It's hard. It's hard
 to talk about, 
you know, because you 
and Rodger just have more 
of that heart and soul 
 that we want. 
Me and Colby and Keith 
usually get together 
and talk about the order. 
We all agree or disagree 
 on things. 
COLBY: 
 But there is one 
 other alternative. 
That we can eliminate Jerri. 
KEITH: 
I mean... we are... 
We're stuck with her... 
Keith, I'm sorry, 
 but we're talking 
about a lot of 
 money at stake. 
No, I understand that. 
I understand that, man. 
We have an opportunity 
staring us right in the face, 
and it's guaranteed. 
Want to get rid 
 of Jerri collectively? 
Keith, listen to what 
 you just said. 
Why would we allow 
 that possibility 
to even come
 to fruition 
when we've got 
 an opportunity 
 right now 
to keep things going exactly
 the way they are, 
and then get rid of 
 Jerri as soon as we can?
And, boy, 
 do I want to. 
Man, I had to 
 put up with her 
 all day yesterday. 
You know, it's, uh... 
I can't imagine getting rid 
 of Elisabeth over her, but... 
I know, and, uh... 
It's just... It's-It's... 
My gut tells me... 
 It's the right move. 
I understand. 
I mean, it makes sense. 
COLBY:
 Blue. 
Thanks.
RODGER: 
Hey, now. 
Here we go. 
We're off like 
 a herd of turtles. 
( indistinct talking ) 
Now I'll bring in 
 the first member of our jury. 
The jury is not 
 to be addressed. 
No comments, reference 
 to the jury. 
The jury will not 
 speak to you. 
The jury is merely here 
 to gather information 
that they will use in deciding 
which one of the final 
 two gets the million dollars. 
Each Tribal Council, 
as you guys are voted off, 
you will become 
 a part of the jury, 
and the power will 
 shift to that side. 
Nick, on a scale of one to ten, 
how important 
 was immunity for you today? 
Oh, this is a ten.
If, um, if I hadn't
 won immunity today,
I fully expected 
 to get voted off. 
Based on? 
Based on the way 
voting has been going, uh, 
based on my place in the tribe. 
Uh, I fully expected 
 if I lost today to, uh, 
be sitting on, in the jury 
 the next time around, so... 
Jerri, as you look 
at the jury, you got 
one member 
 over there.
You guys, 
 right now,
have a one-in-eight shot 
at a million bucks. 
Have you surprised yourself with
 the way you've acted out here? 
Honestly, I had no idea 
that this was going 
 to be as tough as it is. 
And I have woken up 
in the morning 
and gone through an entire day 
 wondering who I am. 
Things come 
out of my mouth 
in frustration 
and out of hunger 
and just stress that, 
 after they come out, 
I want 
 to suck them back in and... 
'cause it's not something 
that I would normally say, 
or, or act. 
So, yeah, I've surprised myself 
in a lot of ways. 
JEFF: 
Elisabeth, 
due to the numbers, 
you're having 
 to sort of go their way. 
Worried at all? 
Strong competitor, 
you're going to be tough 
if you get 
to the final two. 
You're probably 
a target 
at some point. 
ELISABETH: 
That definitely goes 
through my mind. 
You know, you come here, 
and basically, 
 anyone is a target, 
but when you're in a minority, 
you know, of numbers, 
the reality sets in 
a little more harshly. 
You're always 
vulnerable here. 
Nothing is guaranteed 
and you can't 
assume anything, 
because that's the most 
 dangerous, dangerous thing
you can possibly do here, 
in the outback, 
 in this game, is assume. 
Assume you're safe, 
 assume you're right. 
You're not. 
And, so I come here prepared... 
 for the worst. 
So, let's vote. 
Elisabeth, you're first. 
Elisabeth, this is going 
 to be the hardest vote yet, 
and the hardest vote 
 for the rest of the game, 
but the only reason why 
 I am making it is because 
I made a word 
 with my original tribe, 
and I want to stick to my word.
RODGER: 
 Most days, 
 she gets up in a good mood, 
but, oh, baby, look out if 
she gets up in a bad mood. 
I've never in my life met anyone
more likable and more lovable. 
Because you are 
 such a likable person, 
it is a definite threat. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person voted out 
of the tribe will be asked 
to leave the Tribal 
Council area immediately. 
First vote... 
Elisabeth. 
Jerri. 
Elisabeth. 
Jerri. 
Two votes Elisabeth, 
two votes Jerri. 
Three votes Jerri. 
Four votes Jerri, 
 two votes Elisabeth. 
Five votes Jerri. 
 That's enough. 
You need to bring 
me your torch. 
Checkmate. You guys got me. 
( chuckles ) 
Good game.
Jerri, the tribe 
has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Based on that vote, 
maybe the game has changed, 
 and a new tribe 
finally has been born. 
Barramundi is alive 
 and kicking. 
You guys can head back to camp. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode 
and hear what Jerri has to say.
Next time on Survivor: 
The tribe wakes up and realizes
 that Jerri is really gone... 
Sweet. 
Her own tribe voted against her.
...but the survivors 
 are too hungry to celebrate. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm just, like, 
shaking and weak. 
JEFF: 
 They are offered more food, 
but at what price? 
You know, it's funny, 
because I absolutely knew 
this was coming. 
It must have been my remark 
 about how this game isn't fair.
I'm pretty sure that's 
 what set everyone off. 
I've had a great time, 
 and I'm still up 
for sitting around 
 with everybody 
having a beer and laughing 
 about this whole thing.
