         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Keith and Tina 
 plotted to take down Jerri. 
She's the most bossy, 
domineering person 
 I've ever met. 
I didn't come out here 
 to be pushed around 
by a bartender 
 wannabe-actress.
JEFF: 
 Jerri persuaded Colby 
 to make a deal. 
It's me, you and Amber 
 through to the end. 
It's not like you're making 
 a deal with the devil here. 
COLBY: 
 I simply agreed 
 to go along with them 
to get me down 
the road a little better. 








JEFF: 
 Kimmi's morals 
were compromised when the tribe
won chickens 
 in a reward challenge. 
Don't break 
her wings, though. 
Can't they give us some
 edamame, some tofu...? 
JEFF: 
 Michael shocked 
 his tribe by killing a pig. 
We live in a sick tribe. 
We're going to get strong now. 
JEFF: 
 Kucha continued 
 their winning streak 
by taking the 
 immunity challenge, 
sending Ogakor back 
 to Tribal Council 
for the third consecutive time,
where the vote 
 was deadlocked in a double tie 
between Keith and Mitchell. 








One vote is the difference. 
But ultimately it was Mitchell 
who was voted out, 
 putting a dent 
in Jerri's 
 hopes for an alliance. 
12 are left. 
 Who will be voted out tonight? 
( birds twittering ) 
We really started 
 noticing the smoke 
and hearing 
 the trees explode and crash. 
Uh, yesterday, I guess, is when
 it got the closest to us, 
and now we're just completely 
 pretty much overtaken by smoke.
My eyes are watering. 
TINA: 
 It's just extremely 
hazy and smoky, and... 
it's an interesting morning. 
AMBER: 
 Well, we've had an interesting 
past couple of days, 
 as far as, uh... 
Let's see, 
 our last Tribal Council 
we lost Mitchell, 
 which was a surprise. 
JERRI: 
 It was a pretty... 
 pretty traumatic evening. 
I think our... 
our little group 
 of common voters 
has been busted up. 
It's a whole 
 new ball game right now. 
I love this game. 
( whispering ): 
 Tina and Keith 
are definitely 
 grouped together, 
but Colby is like the 
 one in the middle, like... 
They're totally 
 grouping together. 
Everyone else 
 is trying 
to pair up and they're trying...
 We're all vying 
for Colby's vote. 
I'm playing from 
 the center, dude. 
I'm playing 
 for the joy.
( Keith laughing ): 
 Let's squash this one.
AMBER: 
 It seems like... 
since Tina was able 
 to get Colby 
to sway his vote last time 
 to vote for Mitchell, 
seems like maybe he, uh, 
might sway again to their side, 
but we're almost 
kind of fighting over him. 
What we did was strategic, 
and it was to help the team out,
 and I know it did that. 
I have, you know... 
I'm not harboring 
 any ill feelings whatsoever 
about the whole deal. 
We still are 
 more powerful 
if the three of us
are voting the same.
I'm still voting just 
 like I did last night, 
based on who's the strongest... 
 who I think's got 
what it takes 
to make it in. 
Maybe tomorrow, 
I might be 
thinking a whole lot different, 
but... right now I'm not. 
I mean, it's basically the end 
 of any alliance, pretty much. 
Jerri, I don't care. 
I don't care 
 about that stage of it. 
I mean, all I care about 
is doing 
everything we can 
to win the next two 
immunity challenges. 
That's the only thing 
I can focus on right now. 
KIMMI: 
 Good morning, stinkies. 
We gotta clean you out 
 'cause you all stink. 
Last night was a very 
 uncomfortable sleeping night. 
It was drafty, it was cold. 
Nobody slept last night. 
Like, it was just like 
 one of those nights 
where anything 
 and everything 
that could wake you up did. 
I woke up once, and there was a 
 hot coal on my shirt-- look. 
You're kidding? 
And there was a 
little fire in my woolly. 
ALICIA: 
 "Fire in my woolly." 
That's not the first 
time I heard that. 
Well, how the hell 
 did it bypass 
everybody else in front of you? 
I don't know, but if it came 
all the way back here, 
it could have 
landed on your face. 
MICHAEL: 
That's exactly right. 
JEFF V.: 
You know 
what I'm saying? 
That's not funny. 
It's not funny. 
JEFF V.: 
 The fire had been popping coals
out of the fire onto us. 
Wow. 
JEFF V.: 
 So, we had to move our 
our fire this morning. 
It just was getting 
 a little too dangerous. 
Very good chickens. 
They're very happy now. 
Hello, hello... 
JEFF V.: 
 We got fire. 
It was a little
 inconvenient 
 right there, 
you know, but, boy, 
it'll be nice tonight. 
Gonna be different around there 
 when it gets cold at night. 
I guess we're ready to go. 
Chicken-killing time. 
ALICIA: 
 You know what, though? 
That hatchet 
 needs to be sharpened. 
It's pretty dull again. 
RODGER: 
 Mike got the pig, 
and, uh, we ate real good, but 
we wasn't able to save 
 all the meat, so I guess 
we're going to eat chicken, 
 so we want to have the ax... 
( scraping continues ) 
as sharp as possible 
 while we're... 
while we're doing 
 the chicken in. 
KIMMI: 
 Hello, ladies. 
I have such brilliant hens 
 over here, yes... 
MICHAEL: 
 I just tell Kimmi, "For 
 your own self-preservation, 
"let go of the chicken thing. 
Stop talking about them, 
stop getting involved..." 
What's going on over here? 
We're building a fire 
to boil water, to 
 kill the chicken. 
( clucking ) 
Well, that's my cue. 
Yeah, we're ready. 
See you later. Bye. 
MICHAEL: 
 Stop making a big spectacle 
 when you leave. 
"Oh, you're butchering 
 the chickens, 
I'm out of here!" 
Da-da-da-da-da! 
 You know, I mean, it's just... 
It's too theatrical. 
It's just too much. 
KIMMI: 
 Bye, chickies. Bye-bye. 
I'm ready. 
I'm feeling the need 
 to shed some blood. 
ALICIA: 
 Whatever. 
Why don't you watch?
Yeah, sure.
Now, I don't, I don't, 
 I don't enjoy 
killing animals, neither. 
Sure. 
I don't, really, 
but sometimes... 
Nobody wants to do it? 
Jeff, you want 
to do it? 
 No. 
MICHAEL: 
 I thought Jeff 
 wanted to do it. 
Maybe next time.
You got it? Okay. 
( pounding, squawking ) 
I like that. 
Get these feathers off. 
Oh, they're hot.
Yeah, this is by
 far the right...
Good stuff. 
That chicken's 
going to be so awesome. 
It's gonna be so good. 
That looks great. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome.
AMBER: 
 The food situation 
 could definitely be better. 
It could always get better. 
We're not eating 
 that much at all. 
We're definitely not eating 
as much as the other tribe is. 
When you come to see me, 
we have to go somewhere 
and get a really good pizza. 
Okay. 
And lots of 
garlic and bread... 
We haven't caught any fish 
 for, I think, two days now. 
The whole hunger thing, 
that for me 
 has been a huge hurdle. 
Keith, did you 
disassemble some of these 
for the line the other night? 
The only ones that are 
 rigged to go are the cricket 
and the silver one. 
KEITH: 
 Jerri went to go fishing, 
 and she needed the can, 
and of course, she hollered out
 to me, like her older sibling. 
What do you suggest 
we do with the fish guts? 
I said we'll 
 take them to the end 
and dump them 
 in the water like we've 
been doing it, 
 and so, she brought them 
down to the water's edge, 
down at the end of camp 
 to dump them out 
and then 
 she yelled back that it's 
not a smart idea to dump them 
 in there, because... 
We're literally 
feeding the fish 
every time we dump 
 the guts down there. 
Well, my vote is that 
 you just bury them 
in the sand down by
 the end down there.
And the thing is, 
 it's also downwind from us, 
so once they start rotting, 
if by chance 
you get a second, 
if you want to... 
I'll bury them. 
 Yeah? 
No problem. 
 That would 
 be really cool. 
It's all right. 
I'm thinking on these 
 couple hundred acres 
of water, I'm not sure that 
a few fish eating some dead fish
is going to matter 
a whole lot, but whatever. 
JERRI: 
 It's just ridiculous 
 to me to continue 
to dump the guts 
 at the end of our beach. 
We're literally 
 feeding the fish. 
It's no wonder 
 we haven't been able 
to catch anything-- 
 they're all full. 
It's not that big 
 of a deal, but apparently... 
it was. 
I don't stand up 
 to her that often, 
'cause I don't find it 
necessary, 'cause 
 it's more exhausting 
to argue with her than anything.
The fish... are now... buried. 
Dead fish. 
JERRI: 
 We haven't been 
 catching fish again, 
and the other team is eating 
 chickens and pigs and eggs, 
you know, and here we are 
 over here, starving to death. 
KEITH: 
 You have any? 
No luck. 
Those are the things 
 that I didn't really think 
going into this 
 that were going to bother me, 
but it has. 
KIMMI: 
 ...something really different. 
ALICIA: 
 No, no, I didn't get 
 upset about you. I left. 
KIMMI: 
But my... no, my point is, 
is that with 
the, uh, chicken, 
I'm just saying for these guys 
 to stay stronger, 
it's better to, like, 
 do every other day, 
putting meat in their body. 
You got to be kidding. 
I don't know. 
 We're active every day. 
We need protein every day. 
That's not a good argument. 
 It's not gonna work. 
This isn't like a debate 
 to be arguing about. 
No, I know. 
 I'm just saying... 
But I'm telling you why
 I don't agree with you.
That's exactly
 the point. 
Okay, well, you don't have 
to agree with me. 
And I don't. 
 So there you go.
Okay, fine. 
I'm tired of 
 the chickens, 
 tired of it. 
ALICIA: 
 Excuse me?
Do you have some kind 
 of a problem? 
Yeah, I have a problem 
with your attitude. 
Oh, really? 
What the hell is up your butt? 
What you just said
 is not true. 
We should be 
 having protein
 every day. 
If we have to have 
 the chickens, we will.
I'm just saying, if you had 
the chickens here... 
Right! You see us 
 going fishing, right? 
That's all I was saying-- 
It's a good thing just 
 to break it up, especially... 
You are the defensive one 
about the chickens, not me, 
so do not yell at me 
 about the chickens. 
I am not getting 
 emotionally attached. 
You can get as emotionally 
 attached as you want, 
because the only reason 
 why we said it 
is 'cause we care 
 about your feelings, 
'cause you're part 
 of this tribe. 
But don't jump all over me,
 sweetheart, don't ever... 
Don't wave your finger 
in my face. 
I will always wave my finger 
 in... 
And mumble 
under your breath. 
You want me to say
 it to your face? 
Yes, say it to my face. 
Yes, I will be happy to.
I'm saying it to your 
 face right now. 
Thank you! 
I'm tired of you 
 and the ... chickens. 
You heard it! 
What have I said 
about the chickens, though? 
Nothing! 
That's the problem. 
Please! You and
 your little... 
KIMMI: 
 She has more of an issue 
with the chickens than I do. 
God! 
ALICIA: 
 I don't really appreciate her 
 to begin with, 
so for me to try to walk away 
 from a situation 
I know is potentially 
 gonna turn ugly, 
and her not to let me do that, 
made me want to just run up 
 and grab her by the throat. 
But I... I had to keep my wits 
 about me, 
because that's not 
 what this is about. 
JEFF V.: 
What did I just miss? 
I was peeing? 
Plenty. 
I've never liked Kimmi-- 
 we all know that-- 
so when she jumps on me, 
I will go at her 
 guns loaded, okay?
What did she say, though? 
I totally missed it. 
What happened? 
Sitting on the floor 
 of the house, she goes... 
KIMMI: 
 Alicia has always had 
 a problem with me. 
She said, "Kimmi, don't get 
 too attached to the chickens." 
I'm, like, "I'm not getting 
 attached to the chickens." 
Like, don't worry! 
 I'm a big girl. 
I said, "You know, 
while we have the chickens here,
we shouldn't just eat 
 four chickens and a pig 
back-to-back days. 
And I said, "You 
 know what, Kimmi? 
"This is why we didn't
 want you to get 
emotionally attached
 to the chickens." 
 That's all I said. 
KIMMI: 
 She's very critical 
 of other people, 
she's very condescending 
 of other people, 
and I will not be treated, um, 
you know, like a jerk-off. 
Give me a break. 
If you're gonna make sense, 
you can say 
 whatever you want to me, 
but if you're not 
 gonna make sense, 
 keep your mouth shut. 
JEFF V.: 
 I knew that 
that that Alicia/Kimmi 
 explosion was coming. 
I knew it was coming. 
Kimmi was befriending 
 the chickens 
and giving them names 
 and petting them, 
and, um, Alicia 
 just had no patience. 
Alicia doesn't have a lot 
of patience for anybody, really.
I had enough, 
and I let loose, baby. 
ELISABETH: 
 Alicia is in charge 
 of telling people to do things.
Alicia's also in charge 
 of talking trash about people. 
We still have 
to stay together as a team. 
We do.
So I'm willing 
to live and let live. 
I just think it was 
a silly misunderstanding, but...
we all are on the same team, 
 so we got to... 
at least have a poker face on 
 for game day, I suppose. 
( birds chirping and squawking )
NICK: 
 This fire doesn't 
 throw off the heat 
that the other fire did. 
ALICIA: 
 This is the only time, though, 
 when the fire really stinks. 
NICK: 
 We moved the fire pit 
 away from our camp 
for some safety reasons. 
And we had it nice and close-- 
about five feet 
from where we all sleep-- 
so it was really warm at night. 
But we moved it away, 
 and last night 
was really, really cold. 
Coldest night for me. 
Whew! 
NICK: 
 You know, what can we do? 
We don't have any blankets, 
 so we just bundle up. 
ALICIA: 
Come on over to the fire. 
RODGER: 
It's cold on that outside. 
MICHAEL: 
 Let me tell you, 
it was cold on the inside, 
so if it was cold 
 on the inside... 
RODGER: 
 Oh, cold. 
KIMMI: 
 The water here grosses me out 
 more than anything. 
This Crocodile Creek is... 
food and bathroom 
to fish and crocodiles 
 and birds and bats and, 
you know, all kinds 
 of algae and bacteria, 
and it's just... I don't know, 
I just find it to be 
 incredibly gross. 
MICHAEL: 
 Kimmi, I don't know if 
 she's been in the water once, 
and, uh, the dirt's starting 
 to stick to her. 
But also 'cause you can see 
my tan line. Look at it. 
MICHAEL: 
 You know, if one of the girls 
puts on a different top, 
 you'll see a tan line. 
When Kimmi puts on 
 a different top, 
you'll see a dirt line. 
KIMMI: 
 I washed yesterday. 
MICHAEL: 
 You changed clothes. 
I mean, your neck 
 is, like, filthy. 
Filthy. Well, because... 
oh, because I was 
carrying tree stuff today. 
That's why my neck 
is filthy. 
And then she got 
 real defensive about it. 
I said "I'm..." 
I said, "If I had a booger 
 hanging out of my nose, 
"and you told me about it, 
 I would say thank you. 
I wouldn't get all mad at you."
That's nice. 
I mean, it's not bad. 
I mean, we're all dirty.
Whew! 
It's a big one! 
Is it FedEx? 
It's, like, a package. 
Wow. 
It's a book!
 It's a catalog. 
Check this thing out. 
MICHAEL: 
 That is stylin'! 
KIMMI: 
 Wow! 
ELISABETH: 
 Okay, "You must be prepared 
 when your tribe's in a bind. 
Build a travois, 
and save their behinds..." 
JEFF V.: 
Build a what? 
A stretcher thing.
Like a stretcher. 
"...and save their behinds. 
"Look through this book. 
 You can only choose two. 
"Plus from your friends 
at Target, 
clean teeth and shampoo!" 
KIMMI: 
 Shampoo! Oh! 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my God, you guys! 
We get to pick
 two things. 
We get to 
 pick two things.
Okay, boxers 
 and slippers? 
 No. 
We'll skip that page. 
Toilet paper? 
NICK: 
 Blankets, we need blankets. 
ELISABETH: 
 Blankets I think 
 is one, don't you? 
Blankets would be wonderful, 
'cause we really... 
now that we moved our fire... 
MICHAEL: 
I think we're all in agreed 
on that one. 
Everybody wants the spices? 
Oh, it is a catalog...
Raise your hand. 
 Everybody wants spices, 
what do you want? 
Spices? I'll go with spices. 
ELISABETH: 
 The two items that we chose... 
we definitely need blankets. 
Last night was really cold. 
I had a miserable night's sleep.
I don't know if anyone really 
 slept through, 
especially without our fire 
 out here, it's so cold. 
We are going to choose 
 for the second item spices, 
and we get 
 toothpaste and shampoo 
when we win this today. 
ALICIA: 
 "Travois." 
They're using some French words.
NICK: 
 A stretcher. 
ALICIA: 
 It's a stretcher, 
to carry somebody in. 
MICHAEL: 
 Look how they show 
 the thing, though. 
It's not like what you'd think. 
It's a teepee... 
 it's a triangle. 
Oh, wow. 
 We have to make one 
 of these, you guys. 
So, how do we want 
to build this thing? 
Let's think.
We could even make something 
out of rope 
 for her feet to sit in. 
We could have add-ins, 
 like a pillow... 
If we use that bamboo 
 pole, how are we going
to tie onto that? 
Those up there are 
 going to start to cross. 
KIMMI: 
 Is that real hard wood? 
That can go right under my butt.
JEFF V.: 
 That's the width. 
 We want the length. 
MICHAEL: 
 Keep it tight where 
 you guys had it, at the top. 
Can you come around this 
and tie a bunch 
of slipknots in? 
ELISABETH: 
Is that on your head? 
Yeah, but that's okay. 
ALICIA: 
 We're gonna need it 
 for the back corner... 
RODGER: 
 Are your legs still 
where you can reach the corners?
Or you need to slide down 
 a little bit? 
ALICIA: 
 Rock solid. 
MICHAEL: 
 One, two, lift. 
( Elisabeth laughs ) 
ALICIA: 
Feels stable enough? 
Whee! 
RODGER: 
 All right, 
 we got it down.
ELISABETH: 
 I think over at, uh, Ogakor, 
they're probably 
 trying to pull it together 
really well. 
We have to go out there 
as if we're facing a tribe 
just as strong as we are. 
AMBER: 
 Who's gonna decide 
do we want to make it 
 like a rectangle...? 
All right, here, give 
 me the good stuff, 
then just hold... 
 You hold onto that end, 
and as I weave it, 
just follow-follow me with this.
COLBY: 
We're dragging this thing. 
We want the least amount 
 of friction we can get. 
JERRI: 
Okay, so what's your point? 
What's wrong with this? 
I'm saying... 
Do you see what I'm 
doing with this, though? 
Exactly, and I think
 it's great. 
I'm saying instead 
 of starting it over the top,
start it underneath.
You see what I'm saying? 
KEITH: 
 We got two pieces.
JERRI: 
No, I don't see what 
you're saying. 
You guys want to, like, put her 
 in it and pick it up-- 
the four of us, 
just to see what happens? 
I kind of took over 
 when making the travois. 
I knew that the idea I had 
 would work, 
and everybody was just kind 
of standing around and talking, 
and no one was doing anything, 
so I just kind of grabbed 
 the bull by the horns. 
God bless America. This... 
KEITH: 
 I have probably a 
 little more patience 
than Colby does. 
But I can usually tell when 
 he's getting a little tense 
and a little agitated. He'll... 
He'll walk away from it 
 and just take a breath. 
JERRI: 
 Let's try it this way, 
 just in case we're able to.
AMBER: 
 Is it really bad? 
Yay, it works! 
Ooh! 
 Oh! 
COLBY: 
 The toughest part 
 for this tribe 
is coming 
 into these challenges 
with our guns blazing, 
 ready to rock. 
We gotta win this thing, and we 
 still got a shot at doing it. 
JEFF: 
 Come on in, guys. 
All right, well, we've already 
 established how tough it is 
living in the Outback. 
You're battling-- among other 
things-- an out-of-control fire,
wildlife, crocodiles, 
 snakes, spiders. 
If you get hurt, 
 you are a long way from help. 
You have to be able 
to rely on your tribemates 
to get you back to safety. 
That's where today's challenge 
 comes in: triage. 
You were asked to build 
 a travois; 
a three-sided stretcher. 
You're going to use that today. 
Two members from each tribe 
 will be the rescuers. 
Three members will be 
 the victims. 
You'll be placed at three 
different spots out here 
on the river 
 on little sand spits. 
There's a flag designating 
 the area. 
There is a circle 
 around that flag. 
The victims will stand inside 
 that circle. 
When the rescuers get out there,
 you get on your travois 
and you head back. 
Once they cross this line 
 and they're okay, 
they are miraculously healed, 
 they become a rescuer. 
Now you have three. 
Go on for the next person. 
First tribe to get all three 
 of their victims back 
to the first-aid camp 
 wins reward. 
Now, Kucha, because you guys 
 have two extra members, 
two people will sit out. 
The winning tribe gets 
 what they wanted 
and also what 
 the other tribe wanted. 
( all groaning ) 
ELISABETH: 
 Shut up! 
JEFF: 
 So, Kucha, you chose 
 the blankets and the spices. 
Ogakor, you also chose 
 the spices and the soup mix. 
ALICIA: 
 It's a beautiful thing. 
JEFF: 
 And Target has thrown 
 in a few other items. 
They're not necessities, 
 these are luxuries. 
Got fresh toothbrush... 
AMBER: 
 Oh, my God! 
...toothpaste, deodorant. 
RODGER: 
 Oh, yeah, we could use that. 
And of course, what every 
survivor needs-- shampoo. 
( all exclaiming ) 
Wow!
Oh, my God.
That's awesome.
Okay, you guys decide 
 who's going to sit out. 
Decide on your rescuers 
 and your victims. 
Wait for my start. 
Go, Ogakor! 
 Come on, guys! 
JEFF: 
Kimmi and Rodger, you're sitting
 out for Kucha. 
A lot of reward at stake. 
 Survivors, ready? 
Go! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
Go, Tina! 
Go! Go! 
 Go! Go! Go!
Dude, come here.
Go! Go! Go! 
Go! Go! Pick it up! 
Go right across there. 
Go, Kucha! 
That's it. Push, push, 
 push, push, push! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
Kucha! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
( yelling, shouting ) 
( indistinct talking ) 
You're ahead! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
Walk through! 
Okay, okay. 
I love you,
 Kucha! 
I love you, 
 I love you, I love you. 
( cheering ) 
Good job, Kucha.
Good job. 
 All right.
Congratulations. 
Nice job, Kucha.
 It's all yours. 
Here we go, guys. 
What is it? 
Blankets! 
( cheering ) 
Toilet paper! 
( excited talking ) 
( cheering ) 
I'm just so tired of losing. 
TINA: 
 Don't let 'em break
 your spirit down. 
COLBY: 
 I am getting 
 very frustrated with losing. 
If we don't turn up 
the heat and turn 
this runaway train around, 
then it may be a meltdown 
 for the Colbster. 
TINA: 
 It's not the things you lose, 
 it's just losing. 
You know, it takes such 
 a psychological hit 
on your already 
psychologically tired body, 
that, for our team, 
it's definitely the loss 
 that hits us hard. 
ALICIA: 
 Winning the reward challenges 
is, basically, just one more 
 nail in the coffin. 
Not as important as immunity, 
 but another thing 
that's gonna sink them 
 just a little bit lower. 
I don't mean 
 to sound evil,
but it's all about 
 kicking somebody's ass.
ALICIA: 
There is no way 
they're gonna give up. 
They were very 
graceful losers, actually. 
I'm just so glad 
we're not them right 
now-- that's rough. 
JEFF V.: 
 Some of the people in the tribe
 are talking about 
how guilty they feel 
 and how bad they feel 
for the other tribe-- 
 and screw it! 
I mean, chop their heads off, 
 chop their legs off. 
This is a game and I'm ready 
to beat every one of them. 
I'm ready to chop 
 their heads off 
and their eyeballs out
 so Mike can eat 'em...
( laughter ) 
JEFF V.: 
I stink. 
ELISABETH:
 Me, too. 
Toothpaste and toothbrush 
and shampoo and deodorant. 
I'm not going to know 
 what to do with myself. 
Oh, my gosh! 
 Shampoo that doubles as soap. 
JEFF V.: 
 Let's go wash.
Everybody else smells out here, 
but everybody else bathes. 
Thank God 
 we won that challenge, 
so that we can bathe Kimmi. 
MICHAEL: 
 Group bath. 
We won the reward challenge 
 yesterday 
and we used the shampoo-- 
 we each got a handful, 
and we just all soaped up, 
'cause the camp was getting 
 a little stinky. 
Some more than others, 
because some people bathe 
 more than others around here, 
but it was fun. 
( laughter ) 
We got mail! 
"This next challenge will 
prove harder than the rest, 
"You'll be rats in a maze 
for this little test. 
"Just keep your wits 
 and you'll make it with ease. 
The prize is the idol and that's
much better than cheese." 
Oh, a maze. 
AMBER: 
I think we should have 
a little pep talk. 
Well, I think... today, 
I don't think it's our
 strength that's going 
to get us through 
 this challenge. 
I honestly think it's 
 our minds and our hearts, 
and if we all believe 
 that we can do it, 
I definitely think we can. 
So just make sure 
 that you don't doubt 
your heart and your
 mind at all today, 
and I think that's what
 will get us through it.
There's a lot of pressure 
 on us today-- a lot. 
But let's not forget also 
 to have fun with this. 
It is going to take every ounce 
 of keenness, of smarts, 
of strength, 
 of everything we have. 
The excuses are done, 
check 'em at the door 
and let's get 
down to business. 
It is going to be one hell 
of a show today and it's, 
you know, I think we're as ready
 as we're going to be. 
All right, Ogakor.
 Here we go! 
Let's do this! 
I'll take that. 
Once again, give it up, Varner. 
The immunity idol 
 is back up for grabs. 
Here's the deal today-- 
 a giant maze. 
46 tons of lumber, three miles 
 of burlap, two weeks to build. 
Each maze is identical. 
Inside each maze, 
 five totem poles. 
Attached to each totem pole 
 are these medallions. 
They're numbered-- 
 one, two, three, four, five. 
Working as a unit, your goal 
 is to get through the maze, 
collecting 
 the medallions in order. 
One first, then two, then three.
If you find five first, 
 don't grab it. 
Once you've collected all five, 
get out of the maze 
 on the other side. 
First tribe to the immunity idol
 wins immunity. 
It's about 110 degrees today. 
Should work up a nice lather. 
Kucha, because there's no 
 obvious advantage 
or disadvantage to having 
 more members in this, 
you'll run the full seven-- 
 all right, we'll get going. 
ALL: 
 One, two, three, Ogakor! 
ALL: 
 Kucha! 
All right, immunity at stake! 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
Dead end. 
Go back, go back. 
Hurry, hurry. 
Dead end-- 
go back, go back. 
 Straight--
 this way. 
NICK: 
 I see one, I see one, I just 
don't know how to get there. 
There's two. 
Two. 
Two in the far right corner. 
 Keep on moving. 
This way, this way. 
We all together? 
 Yeah. 
All right. 
 Dead. Dead. 
Work around to the right. 
Right here. 
Got it, got it, got one. 
Two is over there. 
Go! 
Go! Go!
( indistinct talking ) 
No, no, it's right here. 
One! One! One! 
Okay, where
 was two? 
Far right corner. 
 Far right corner. 
This way! This way! 
 This way! 
No, go left,
 this way. 
I'm right here! 
You're going nowhere! 
 It's this way! 
Come here. 
 Is everybody here? 
Have we found 
three yet? 
No. 
 Got to be in 
 the back corner.
Back up? 
Back, all the way in the corner.
Go. Come on. 
Here we go, here we go. 
Jeff! 
 I got two right here. 
Go, go, go. 
Good job, good job. 
Yeah, we lost 
three. 
( indistinct talking ) 
Other way-- right there. 
Straight? 
 Three. Right there. 
It's right in here. 
 Come back. 
It's right here.
This... Right there. 
 Go around this way. 
That's three. 
Four is in the front
 right corner. 
Five is in the middle. 
 Come on, Amber. 
Go, Keith, go. 
Go on, go on, go on, go on! 
I think we got to go 
 all the way back down. 
( all talking at once ) 
Come on, you guys, we got it. 
Left? 
 Left. Yeah! 
Right here, guys! 
All right, 
all right. 
Keep moving.
I got it, I got it. 
 Got it, got it, got it. 
No, no, no, right here. 
 It's right here. 
We just gotta get 
 there from that way.
It's right here, 
 we got to get to it 
from that 
 side, though. 
Can we go 
around that way? 
Where is it? 
 Here it is! 
Go, go. 
Which way? 
 It's that way.
This is it, this is it. 
 We gotta go. 
Tina, don't get lost! 
 Tina, come here! 
Okay, I see your flag! 
 Come back, Tina. 
No, dead end, dead end! 
Go. Turn around! 
I'm right behind you! 
 Come on. 
I'm here, 
 I'm here. 
Come on! 
Back, back, back. 
I'm here. I'm here. 
 We're here. Go, go! 
We're out! We're out! 
Come on! 
 Hurry up! 
( screaming ) 
( cheering ) 
JEFF: 
Yesterday, sitting in 
the water, Amber, 
tears rolling down your face, 
you said, "I'm sick of losing." 
Do you see any tears right now? 
If they were, 
they'd be tears of joy. 
Congratulations! 
( cheering ) 
All right, guys, 
 you can head back. 
Kucha, see you tonight 
at Tribal Council. 
ALICIA: 
 Exactly. 
 That's the only way.
I don't care if you 
get on my nerves, 
and I don't care if you walk 
up to me and spit in my face. 
I'm sticking to it. 
JEFF V.: 
 We are not a happy tribe. 
We are not the family 
 we appear to be. 
There is some animosity. 
She causes so much trouble
 within the tribe, as well.
That's a name I'm going 
to be happy to write down. 
Yeah, me, too.
KIMMI: 
 I'm sure Jeff and Alicia 
 are gonna vote together, 
and you've been spending 
a lot of time with them, 
so I figure you guys 
are going to vote together. 
Who?
You, Alicia and Jeff. 
I'm not in their pact.
I'm not in their thing.
ALICIA: 
 Tribal Council is a drag, 
no matter which way 
 you look at it. 
It's clear-cut who should go, 
 but they stay a little longer 
and then somebody steps up 
 and looks like they should go. 
So, for me, Kimmi 
 is a physical weakness, 
and she just makes 
 the most sense right now 
because I have 
 personal problems with her. 
We just clash. 
RODGER: 
 It could be very interesting, 
 Tribal Council. 
Right now, I assume 
 that they think 
that I'm voting against Kimmi. 
More than likely, that probably
 will not be the case. 
The only person that 
 I keep my word with out here 
is Elisabeth, 
and I think she's 
 the same way towards me. 
ELISABETH: 
 I took a little siesta 
 and I said, 
it ticked me off that you would
 just complain to everyone else 
and not say something 
 to Kimmi just 'cause 
you're afraid you'll get a vote.
I'm, like, if it's 
 bothering you that much, 
I don't want to hear it,
 tell Kimmi. 
Mm-hmm. 
RODGER: 
 In the boat today, 
we were talking about 
 voting against Alicia. 
And we would miss her, 
 she does a good job cooking, 
uh... you know, 
 she's athletic... 
and, uh... 
but there might be a little bit 
more harmony around, too. 
Ready?
Move it out.
( thunder rumbling ) 
Look at that thunder's 
 coming in. 
Don't like that. 
JEFF: 
 Welcome back. 
I haven't really had a chance 
 to talk to you guys 
since Debb was voted out 
 in the first Tribal Council. 
Haven't been back. 
Michael, last time 
 you were here, 
Rodger sort of, kind of 
 confirmed that you were 
sort of the leader of the group,
or you had taken that position. 
You know, everybody has taken 
 a leadership role in this camp 
in one way, shape or form. 
It happened to be 
that food seemed to be 
on the top of the charts 
 and I was bringing in fish. 
And so, you know, I possibly was
anointed the leader 
by Rodger that day. 
But everybody 
on this team has contributed 
 in their own way 
in equal amount, 
and that's why 
we've been so strong. 
Well, as always, it seems like 
 when you guys are here, 
we get the rain coming down. 
And there go the caps. 
Alicia, talk to me about 
 leadership. 
Because for me, looking in, 
 I would say you seem to be 
a strong leader 
 on this tribe as well. 
I don't know about that. 
I'm not so sure I'm a leader 
 as much as maybe a motivator. 
I like to make sure
that everybody is 
 on the same page. 
I think if we're all 
 on the same page, 
especially going 
 into a challenge, 
there's no way 
 we're going to lose. 
What's your biggest 
 contribution? 
I think my motivation 
 for everybody 
is probably 
 my biggest contribution. 
I'm used to doing that back home
with my job 
 as a personal trainer, 
motivating people.
And I think it just 
 comes naturally to me 
in any kind of situation
to take on that 
 motivation role. 
And that's what I do, 
 or at least I try to. 
JEFF: 
Kimmi, I've seen you in action. 
Where are you feeling 
 in the tribe right now 
as we come to a vote? 
Um... I don't know. 
Just like with anything, 
um... it could depend on the day
 or the weather, 
you know, what goes 
through your head. 
'Cause, every day, you 
feel close to somebody 
and then you feel a 
 little bit separated, 
and it's, um... it's weird. 
All right, guys. 
 Behind me, four torches. 
Debb is the only one familiar 
 to you guys 
and another one is going 
 to be added to that pile 
in a few minutes. 
Let's do it. 
Michael, you're up first. 
This really should be Alicia, 
but I hear other people 
 are voting for Jeff. 
My vote is for Kimmi. 
She and I have not gotten along
 from the beginning, 
and the whole food thing 
 is really becoming an issue. 
It separates her 
 from the rest of the tribe, 
so I think it's time 
 to let her go. 
We need to keep 
 our tribe strong 
and there's too much split 
 going on. 
So, for a strong Kucha, 
it's the best vote. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
 to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
 immediately. 
I'm going to read them. 
First vote... 
Kimmi. 
Next vote... 
Kimmi. 
That's three votes: Kimmi. 
Four votes. 
No need to read the rest. 
Kimmi, you need to bring me 
 your torch. 
Okay, bye, guys. 
ALL: 
 Bye, Kimmi. 
The tribe and Mother Nature 
have spoken. 
It's time for you to go. 
This way? 
Go get 'em, guys. 
JEFF: 
 Well, the good news is: 
you survived Tribal Council. 
Bad news is: this is 
what you get to sleep in. 
Have a good long walk home. 
Grab your torches, 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
( theme music plays ) 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from next time, 
and hear what Kimmi has to say.
Next time on Survivor: 
( man screaming ) 
When the unthinkable happens 
 at Kucha, 
the tribe realizes survival 
 in the outback 
is not just a game. 
"There has been an accident 
 at the Kucha camp." 
Oh, my God. 
And it just really hit hard. 
I knew for a long time 
that my head 
 was on the chopping block. 
It doesn't surprise me at all. 
I'm glad that I stayed true 
 to myself and my morals. 
Um, I know that Alicia and I 
 have not gotten along 
since day one. 
If that's what they felt 
 that they had to do, 
then, you know, 
 power to the team.
