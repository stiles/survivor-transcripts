         JEFF PROBST: 
 39 days ago, 16 Americans began
 the adventure of a lifetime. 
We have a map. 
I guess 
 we're starting here. 
JEFF: 
 They were abandoned 
 in the Australian Outback, 
cut off from their jobs, 
their loved ones 
 and all contact 
with civilization. 
Their goal? 
Work together to build 
 a new world 
but compete against each other 
to become the sole survivor 
 and win one million dollars. 








Kucha! 
 ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my God! 
Kucha, Kucha! 
 JEFF: 
 As two separate tribes, 
Kucha and Ogakor, 
 they strategized. 
JEFF V.: 
 We're just trying 
to figure out who probably is 
 Ogakor's weak link. 
JERRI: 
 If we slip anything out, 
we're done. 
JEFF: 
 They formed alliances. 
ALICIA: 
 The truth of the matter is, 
I feel like you're the only one 
that I really trust 
 at this point. 
JERRI: 
It's not like 
you're making 
a deal with the devil here. 
JEFF: 
 And battled for immunity 








so they would not have to vote 
one of their own 
out of the tribe. 
The tribe has spoken. 
Three members from Ogakor 
 and two from Kucha met 
their untimely end 
 in the first 15 days. 
( Michael screaming ) 
( groaning ) 
He's burnt pretty bad there. 
Oh, my... Oh, my God. 
ALICIA: 
Keep your hands 
in the water. 
JEFF: 
 On day 17, Michael from Kucha 
was forced to leave 
 when he fell into the fire 
and severely burned his hands. 
MICHAEL:
 Kucha! 
You guys know what to do. 
JEFF: 
 His evacuation left the tribes 
 with five members each. 
On day 20 came the merge, 
 and a new tribe, 
Barramundi, was born. 
Since that time, the tribe 
 mates have been forced 
to reconsider old alliances 
 and evaluate new friendships. 
It's a whole new game, 
new people, new set of rules. 
ELISABETH: 
 If you want 
 to keep playing this game, 
you better get 
 a little more ruthless. 
TINA: 
 I want the good guys to win. 
JEFF: 
 They have been pushed 
 to the physical brink. 
My hair is falling out. 
My hair! 
 JEFF: 
 They've endured 
overwhelming hunger... 
This is the least amount of rice
 we've ever had. 
No wonder we're all 
 so weak and tired. 
JEFF: 
 ...and the harsh conditions 
of an unforgiving land. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
KEITH: 
 That was 
 the most miserable night 
in my entire life. 
JEFF: 
 They have made sacrifices... 
Shelter versus food. 
It's one 
or the other. 
Your tarps and that Texas flag.
...and faced the emotional toll
 of their experience. 
Is that a little tear 
in your eye? 
RODGER: 
 Yes, it is.
JEFF: 
 But through it all, 
they have continued 
 to play the game. 
There's nothing fair 
about this-- 
 it's about winning. 
Yes! 
 If you come out holding 
 the immunity, 
then your position is set. 
If you don't come out holding 
 your immunity, 
you better have your bags packed
when you go to Tribal Council. 
Go! 
Last time, Colby again 
 dominated the challenges. 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
 First, he won a new car 
 and a visit 
from his mother as a reward. 
Oh, my God. 
JEFF: 
 Then he won immunity 
for the fourth 
 consecutive time. 
This has had a 
 permanent home 
 here for awhile.
Just been... 
been pretty fortunate. 
JEFF: 
 So the remaining members 
 of Barramundi headed off 
to Tribal Council, 
 and in a difficult decision, 
Elisabeth was voted out. 
Only three are left. 
Tonight, they will compete in 
 one final immunity challenge. 
Two will continue on 
 to face the jury. 
One will outlast all the rest 
 and become the sole survivor. 
? ? 
? ? 
( birds chirping ) 
KEITH: 
 This morning is homestretch. 
There's only three of us left, 
 and, uh... we have three days. 
This is what the 42 days 
 is all about. 
It's about 
 these last three days. 
I mean, everything else 
 becomes just... 
a product to get to this point. 
COLBY: 
 I had the best night's sleep 
I've had 
 in 39 nights last night. 
Solid night's sleep. 
You know, 
 whenever you go 
to bed, and you lay there 
for so long, and you think 
about a lot
 of stuff? 
I don't remember 
 having one thought
after I went
 to lie down.
I mean, I was 
 asleep that quick.
The temperature 
 was good, I guess,
'cause I didn't 
 wake up cold at all.
Right, and we have no rain, 
so we're getting lucky. 
COLBY: 
 The environment 
 and the elements here 
have probably been the most 
 dominant player in this game. 
You've got the 17th player here,
and it's the environment, 
because it's the one 
 dropping you 
to your knees, 
 kicking you in the butt. 
And every time you feel 
 like you're getting up, 
you get knocked down again. 
Either the heat 
 or the lack of food 
or the-the flooding, 
 the rains... 
Something's going to be... 
You know, you're going to get 
 a curve ball no matter what. 
Let's see, do we
 have two days? 
Yeah. 
 Three days-- Friday,
 Saturday, Sunday. 
Six meals.
Yeah, we're in... we're... 
We'll make it. 
We got... 
 Six meals at half 
a cup a meal--
 no problem. 
Plus, we got 
 peanut butter.
Not much of
 it, either.
It's exciting... 
 We're living
 on the edge 
in our rations.
Whether you want to admit it 
or not, you deteriorate. 
In 40 days, 
Day 40 is ten times harder 
 than Day 20 was. 
No question about it. 
Because you're weaker, 
 because you're tired, 
because you're-you're sick 
of dealing with everything 
 you've had to deal with. 
And you've still got 
 to play the game. 
You've still got to think 
 about what's-what's at hand, 
and that's, you know, surviving
 the people long enough 
to get in a position to win. 
TINA: 
 On Day 40, 
being here... becomes 
 this overwhelming surprise. 
I cannot believe that I'm here. 
Even though I'm a competitor 
and I came here with the idea 
 of winning challenges, 
of having an adventure, 
of doing well, I never thought 
 I could get this far. 
As this game is coming 
 to an end, 
I think that I have... evolved,
 that who I started 
out as in this game 
 is not who I've ended up as. 
I have developed more into 
 a strategist, and it worked 
to get me from 16 to three. 
COLBY: 
 Trusting people in this game 
 will get you in trouble. 
And even quicker, 
 it'll get you gone, 
and that's-that's 
 because it's a game. 
And in a way, that's where 
 it parallels life, 
but in a way, that's where 
 it differs from life for me, 
because the only person 
 I've been truly 100% honest to 
in this game is myself, 
and in real life, 
 I'm not that way. 
I'm an honest person. 
But I'm playing to win 
 a million dollars here, 
and so if you trust somebody, 
 it's your own fault. 
You're a fool 
for not playing the game. 
This will be one of 
 our last tree mails.
Yep. 
We won't be getting
 too many more. 
TINA: 
 Wow. 
Whoa, look at this.
 Sweet! 
Holy cow. What is...? 
COLBY: 
 It looks like paint,
 paintbrushes. 
TINA: 
 "After so many days, 
 it is almost the last. 
"And now it is time 
 to reflect on the past. 
TINA/COLBY: 
 "Carve your own idol..." 
TINA: 
"...as a gift 
to the land. 
From the 16 survivors, 
 now just three of you stand." 
Oh, wow. 
 We get to carve it... 
From a little... 
 ...and paint it.
Like a little totem, 
a little idol. 
 Yes. 
Cool thing, Colby.
COLBY: 
 Man, this is going to be 
 all sorts of fun. 
Good. 
Wow... 
COLBY: 
 When we first got 
 the tree mail... 
and-and reading through it, 
 and it said, 
"Giving back to the land," 
I was intimidated by that. 
TINA: 
 Oh, wow, look at this. 
Beads and trinkets. 
Hmm, we'll have to
 think about this. 
At first, I didn't know how. 
I didn't know how to approach 
 that whole statement, 
and it took a-a-a lot of time 
today to remember how much 
I've taken from the land. 
We've used it for our shelter. 
We've used it to stick food 
 in our belly. 
And at first, I didn't get 
 the big picture, 
but when you do stop 
 and think about it for a while 
and really put your mind to it, 
you realize 
 that you've been given a lot. 
KEITH: 
 When we had a chance 
 to work on the idols, 
it was an all-day process, 
 so you had 
a lot of reflection time. 
You thought about, uh, 
crossing the river 
 for the first time. 
You thought about eating 
 your first fish, 
loved ones back home. 
It was a healing process, 
 actually. 
It helped put closure 
 to everything. 
TINA: 
 For me, personally, 
I'm proud of the fact 
 that I'm a woman and I'm here 
in the final three with two men.
And so, I wanted my idol 
 to be feminine in her own way. 
COLBY: 
 While I was working 
 on that totem, 
whether it was painting 
 or carving 
or-or stringing beads 
 or whatever, 
I was reflecting 
 and think about... 
thinking about what the last 
40 days have meant to me. 
I struggled with it at first, 
 trying to figure out 
what I was supposed to do 
 or needed to do, 
and then I thought, 
 'You know, it's mine.' 
And it took me a while 
 to-to grasp that, 
to think that, you know, 
 there's not any rules. 
Just like this game, 
 there were no rules. 
No holds barred, 
 play it how you want 
and see what happens. 
( bird screeching ) 
( insects chirping ) 
COLBY: 
 Six weeks. 
See, six weeks sounds 
so much longer 
 than 42 days to me. 
Mm-hmm. It seems 
 like three weeks, 
doesn't it?
 KEITH: 
 41 days ago, guys,
we crossed this 
 river right here. 
TINA: 
Whew! Loaded 
to the brim. 
KEITH:
 Yeah. 
( sighs ) 
COLBY: 
Mm-hmm. 
KEITH: 
 And we didn't 
 know each other.
TINA: 
 I remember
 us talking
all night long,
 you know, 
and being so excited 
 and thinking about... 
I remember thinking, 
 "God, we've got so long to go, 
you know, we've got 
a long road ahead of us." 
It's been 
a hell of a ride. 
Mm-hmm. 
It's been a long, long journey,
and everything surrounding 
 this game 
is one big emotional pull, 
 and now, you've only got 
three days left, 
 and the people 
that you've shared 
 life with 24-7 
for the past 42 days 
 is going to be over. 
KEITH: 
 Tonight is the last night 
 for one of us 
to be sleeping here. 
Tonight is the last night 
 for somebody. 
It is kind of weird 
to think about... 
...not being here 
tomorrow night, isn't it? 
Oh, I mean, 
 it kills me.
It's like...
I mean, I'm ready to go home 
 and see my family, 
but I'm just... 
I don't want to leave 
 this place. 
COLBY: 
I agree. 
 You know, 
I really love Australia. 
I really love 
the outback. 
COLBY: 
Well, and the hardest thing 
for me, I think, 
with the possibility 
of leaving is it's hard 
for me to grasp 
checking out of the game 
before it's over. 
Mmm. 
And I've never even thought 
about that until just now. 
And that's what 
tomorrow night is for somebody. 
TINA: 
 It's not like 
you voluntarily 
are checking out, 
you know? 
COLBY: 
That's what I'm saying. 
I mean, that's 
the reality. 
But damn it, 
I'll take it like a man. 
( Tina laughs ) 
 KEITH:
 Yes. 
I won't like it, 
 but I'll take it like a man. 
KEITH: 
 We all will.
TINA: 
 I'm not.
I'm going to have 
 a hissy fit 
and just cry and bawl and hissy 
 fit is what I'm going to do. 
COLBY: 
It's going to be weird 
sitting in Tribal Council 
just three chairs 
right there, too. 
KEITH: 
 Ooh, is it ever.
'Cause it's only one vote. 
TINA: 
 Oh! 
 Right.
Three of us don't vote. 
 It's just immunity. 
KEITH:
 Right.
COLBY: 
Walks up, 
puts his name 
in the bucket and comes back. 
 TINA: 
 That's not gonna...
that's not gonna
 be a fun place 
 to be, either. 
No... 
 The immunity man
 or woman or... 
COLBY: 
Nope. 
KEITH: 
 Oh, that's right. 
COLBY: 
One person. 
That's it. 
KEITH: 
 We have an immunity challenge 
 coming up-- 
the most important immunity 
 challenge that any of us... 
any of us will play. 
The winner basically gets 
to walk up and cast a vote. 
At this stage of the game, 
we all feel vulnerable, 
 because at that stage, 
it's not a voting bloc. 
It's who you want to be 
 in the finals with. 
Who do you want the jury 
 to look at sitting next to you 
to potentially choose you 
over them to give you the money?
That's what it's about now. 
Tough call. 
TINA: 
 This last morning, you know, 
everything seems like 
 the last for the three of us, 
and it's just... 
 I know it's a game, 
but still it's sad, you know? 
It's not just a game 
 coming to an end, 
but it's the game 
 coming to an end 
and the three of us 
 leaving each other's company. 
KEITH: 
 The last 24 hours 
 has kind of been 
a little bittersweet. 
One of us is leaving tonight. 
One of us saw the sunset 
for the last time, 
 and the sunrise 
this morning for the last time.
One of us had the last meal 
 with us together, so it was... 
It's kind of, uh, you know, 
 it's, it's strange, 
it's bittersweet, it's sad. 
I want you to know 
 that these are made 
with a great deal of love 
and passion for you guys. 
This is not 
 just your normal breakfast. 
TINA: 
And I just want 
you to know 
they're eaten with 
a great deal of 
love and passion. 
From the bottom 
 of this chef's heart 
to you guys' stomach. 
TINA: 
Thank you. 
Mm-hmm.
Oh, that one's warm. 
COLBY: 
 I don't want to think 
about leaving tonight. 
It's a very real possibility. 
This whole experience 
 has been full of firsts 
and lasts, every day. 
But that's just one facet 
I don't like dwelling on. 
KEITH: 
What do we have 
there, Colby? 
Madame... 
"And now it is time 
"to pack up
 your gear. 
"The ridge of the river 
"is the course 
you will steer. 
"You will pass by the torches 
 of the survivors cut adrift. 
"When you reach the end, 
you will offer
 your gift." 
KEITH: 
 The tree mail gave instructions
on where we should go 
 with the totem that we created,
and we're going to 
walk past the torches 
of all the survivors 
 that went before us. 
And at the end of the walk, 
we're going to offer 
the gift up that we made. 
TINA: 
 Every now and then, 
 you get a glimpse of closure 
and you get a glimpse 
 of the impact, 
and you get a glimpse 
 of how significant it is 
that you've gotten this far. 
And I can already feel it 
 starting to rise. 
You know, 
I can already feel the... 
anxiety of some sort 
 in my chest, 
and a warm fuzzy, 
 you know, coming on. 
And I don't think 
this is going to be easy. 
I think this is going 
 to be, you know, 
one of those times 
of saying good-bye. 
And I don't know why 
 saying good-bye is so hard. 
You know, my gosh, we've 
 been put through the wringer. 
I don't know why 
 it should be so hard, 
but, uh... 
it's hard to say good-bye. 
COLBY: 
 I think the three of us 
are very emotionally attached 
 to each other right now. 
And if the word "love" 
 comes out of your mouth, 
then that's the emotion 
you're feeling at that time, 
 you know? 
I don't love the two of them 
like I love my family, not yet.
I haven't known them 
 long enough. 
But you still share a bond 
that I guess 
 you could call love, I mean, 
'cause you'd have 
 to love some of these people 
to put up with them 
 in the context 
that we have for 42 days. 
KEITH: 
 I think that it seems 
 somewhat apropos 
for this situation, you know? 
That we'd walk past individuals
 that left before us. 
One of us 
 will be leaving tonight, 
and there'll be two left, 
 so I'm actually... 
I'm looking forward to it. 
I guess it's kind of 
a saying good-bye process.

JEFF: 
 Hey, guys.
One of the things I've gathered 
from chatting with you guys 
 for 41 days 
is that this has been 
a life-changing experience 
for the three of you. 
And part of that
 growth comes 
from examining
 the past. 
That was the purpose of 
 the walk you just took--
the chance to think
about your former 
 tribe members, 
how they played
 the game, what 
you learned from them. 
Now, I want to give you a chance
to reflect on your time 
 here in the outback-- 
how you've 
 played the game-- 
the highs, the lows-- 
and what you'll take back home 
 with you from this experience. 
This is the 
 last waterfall
before Tribal Council--
a fitting spot to 
 think about the time
you've spent out here.
So, what I'd 
 like you to do
is take the idols with you 
that you've created 
 over the last couple of days, 
find a quiet spot,
 and just reflect 
on your time here 
 in the outback. 
And then when you're ready,
 come back to this spot, 
and then offer
 your idols 
by tossing them
 in the river. 
This is a chance 
 for you guys to 
 give something back
to a land that has 
 given so much to you. 
When you're finished, 
you'll make the trek together 
 to Tribal Council 
for the final 
 immunity challenge, 
and I'll be waiting
 for you there. 
Enjoy this time. 
All right.
KEITH: 
 The time that I've spent here 
has been a cleansing process. 
I am 40 years old, 
 I got two wonderful kids, 
and have had-- 
 like any other individual 
that's 40 years old-- 
have had failures and successes
 and highs and lows. 
In the last five days, 
 I've realized 
this really is not 
 about the money, 
and it shouldn't be. 
You should walk away from this 
 with something 
that's far more valuable 
 than money, and I will. 
I don't think that I have 
the opportunity 
 to win the money. 
I don't think 
 I'll be at that level. 
I mean, I'm close, 
 but I don't think 
I'll be of the last two, 
 and it's totally fine with me. 
I'm so enriched 
by everything I've gained 
from this process 
 and this experience. 
I feel really great about it. 
I feel very content. 
TINA: 
 I've got to share 
 the past 42 days 
with a lot of people 
who are extremely close 
 to their family. 
And I think that, you know, 
I've been guilty 
 of living my life 
and, uh, trying to be 
 this strong individual 
who didn't really need anybody 
 and, um... 
and ver... fiercely 
 independent. 
And I think for the first time 
 in my life, 
the outback has taught me 
 the value 
of how much your family 
 means to you, 
and that you really do need 
 each other. 
And whenever I get home, 
 I want to go back 
and for the first time 
really nurture my family. 
COLBY: 
 That's what being here 
 for 42 days has done for us-- 
it's made us realize what 
 we take for granted at home, 
and all those things 
 in our daily living 
when we're in our comfort zone 
that we don't appreciate 
because we're so used 
 to having them. 
Well, we've been out here 
 for 42 days, 
now we appreciate 
 those things back home. 
Now we appreciate those people 
 that we've taken for granted 
and the little things they say,
the way they say our name, 
and all those cool things 
that you can't wait 
 to get back to. 
And that's what making 
 these idols was about-- 
so that we appreciate 
 and remember why we were here. 
Hey, guys. 
Go ahead and have a seat. 
Just hold your tablets. 
We'll now bring in 
the jury. 
I'll start 
by asking you 
to pass down 
 the immunity necklace, Colby. 
Well, welcome to Tribal Council 
in a slightly different 
set of circumstances. 
You guys 
have just completed a day 
that was really 
 a rite of passage-- 
a chance to remember 
your former tribe mates. 
Now, the final 
immunity challenge 
will test how well 
you know the folks 
you've spent 
the last 41 days with. 
It's called "Fallen Comrades." 
I'm going to ask you 
 a series of questions 
about those people you voted 
 out of the tribe, 
six of which 
are sitting 
right across from you. 
There'll be 
12 questions 
about your former 
tribe mates. 
Whoever has 
the most 
correct answers 
wins immunity, 
guarantees themselves 
a spot 
in the Final Two, 
and the right 
to choose the person 
that sits next to them. 
So, you're going 
to write your answers 
in big, bold letters 
on your tablet, 
hold it up to your chest 
until I tell you to, 
and then 
turn it around. 
Question number one: 
 Which former survivor 
would be the one 
to tell you 
to "work your magic"? 
Okay, turn them 
around, please. 
Everybody 
says Alicia. 
Everybody's right. 
It was Alicia.
Question 
 number two.
What town is Rodger from? 
Everybody reveal. 
Critteden. 
Crittenden. 
Criton. All right, 
you were there. 
Everybody's right. 
I couldn't spell "Crittenden." 
Question 
 number three. 
According to their 
Survivor applications, 
who was the only member 
 of the Barramundi Tribe 
with a master's
 degree? 
Everybody reveal. 
Nick, 
Nick and Jeff. 
Everybody's wrong. 
 It's Rodger. 
Had a master's 
of arts 
in industrial 
 education. 
He never 
 told us that. 
JEFF: 
 Nobody scores 
 on that one. 
Question number four. 
Who spent 12 years 
 living in Germany? 
Reveal. 
Jerri, 
Jerri, Jerri. 
Everybody's right.
We're still tied 
at three each. 
Question number five. 
It's a visual 
question. 
Who is this person? 
Okay, everybody ready? 
Reveal. 
Kenny, Elisabeth's 
brother and Johnny. 
Kenny is Elisabeth's 
 brother. 
Colby and Tina are both right. 
Colby and Tina, 
you're both at four. 
Keith, you're at three. 
Question number six. 
What two survivors
have tattoos of 
 Chinese characters?
Okay, reveal. 
Keith says 
Alicia and Amber. 
Tina says 
Alicia and Nick. 
Colby, 
Jeff and Kimmi. 
Nobody's right. 
 It was Alicia and Jeff Varner. 
Question 
 number seven. 
Jeff and Alicia also wear 
 jewelry on the same 
part of their body. 
What is it, 
and where do 
they wear it? 
Okay, everybody
 reveal. 
Colby says thumb ring. 
Tina, ring on the toe, 
and Keith says 
bracelet 
and foot anklet. 
Colby's right. Thumb rings. 
They both wear. 
Colby moves into 
the lead with five. 
Tina, you're at four. 
Keith, still at three. 
Five questions left. 
Question 
number eight. 
Whose shorts are these? 
Everybody reveal. 
Jeff, 
Nick and Kel. 
Correct answer-- Nick. 
Tina now has five,
along with Colby. 
Keith, you're 
still at three. 
Four questions 
left. 
What is Elisabeth's 
 boyfriend's name? 
Everybody reveal. 
Tim, Tim, Tim. 
Everybody's right. 
Three questions left. 
Colby and Tina 
are tied. 
Keith, you're down two. 
Question ten. 
It's a follow-up question. 
What college did 
they both attend? 
Everybody reveal. 
Colby says 
Boston College. 
Tina, 
Boston College. 
Keith, Boston University-- 
 Boston University 
not correct, 
it's Boston College. 
Colby and Tina 
both score. 
Colby, you have seven. 
Tina, you've got seven. 
Keith, you only have four. 
You're down three. 
Just two 
questions left. 
No need for you 
to answer any more. 
Colby, Tina, 
 it's down to you two. 
Question 
number eleven. 
Who said on 
their Survivor application 
that they would like to be 
stranded with President Clinton 
or the Pope, because 
they're the most 
 likely to be rescued? 
( laughs ) 
Everybody reveal. 
Jeff and Alicia. 
Neither one is right. 
Nick is the correct 
 answer. Here we are-- 
the final question. 
Colby, you've 
got seven. 
Tina, 
you've got seven. 
This is it. 
One of you gets it right 
and the other doesn't, 
immunity, going 
to the Final Two. 
Who stated on their Survivor 
 application form 
that their proudest 
 accomplishment 
was being on the Dean's 
list in college 
for five semesters? 
For immunity, reveal 
your answers. 
Tina says Nick. 
Colby says Amber. 
Correct answer... 
Amber. 
Yeah! 
Colby continues
 his streak. 
You've just 
won immunity. 
Here's where 
we're at. 
It's time for 
the final vote. 
Keith and Tina 
can't vote for themselves. 
Tina has to vote 
for Keith. 
Keith has 
to vote for Tina. 
Their votes 
nullify each other. 
You're the only person 
 who's going to vote. 
You are voting out one 
person from the tribe, 
and more importantly, 
you are deciding 
who's going to go 
to the Final Two with you. 
So you're going to go up there, 
cast that very important vote, 
put it in the box 
 and bring the box 
back with you to me. 
It's time 
to vote, Colby. 
Once the vote 
 is read, 
the decision is final. 
The person 
 voted out of the tribe 
will be asked to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
immediately. 
Somebody who has played 
this game for 41 days 
is about to be voted 
out of the tribe. 
I'll read the vote. 
The 14th person voted 
out of the tribe... 
..is Keith. 
It has been an honor, guys. 
I love you. 
( indistinct talking ) 
Good job. 
Keith, the tribe 
has spoken. 
Long day 
for you guys. 
Tonight'll be the last night 
you spend under these stars. 
Tomorrow, an even bigger day. 
Final Tribal Council, 
a final vote that 
 will determine 
which one of you
 leaves here 
with a million dollars 
and the title 
of Survivor: 
 The Australian Outback. 
Try to get a good night's sleep.
 You're going to need it. 
You can head back to camp. 
KEITH: 
 It was an absolute honor 
to play this game 
 with these participants. 
My time here spent 
 in the Outback 
really gave me 
 an opportunity to look at life 
from the past, 
 present and the future. 
It was a great, 
 great opportunity, 
and I've learned so much 
 about myself because of it. 
TINA: 
 Usually, when we've 
 left Tribal Council, 
there's been 
 a wide range of emotion, 
such as Mad Dog. 
When we voted her off, that was
 a sad day at the Ogakor camp. 
And there were other times 
 that we came back to camp 
where it just felt awkward. 
We really loved Elisabeth, 
 and it just felt awkward 
almost not having 
 her presence there. 
And there's been some times 
when we came back from camp, 
 and we were a little happy. 
Golly, Tina, this 
is our last night, girl. 
We can afford to burn those 
 candles out if we want to. 
I know it-- no longer 
 do we have 
to worry, you know, 
"How long will that last?" 
Last night, coming into camp, 
 just me and Colby, 
I have to say that it was 
 sheer exhilaration. 
We can burn that, 
 some of our shelter stuff... 
I mean, seriously, 
like this twine-- 
 we don't need it, do we? 
Nope. 
It burns good. 
Burn it, baby. 
I accomplished something 
 that I wanted to do, 
and that was 
 to make it to last two. 
I still feel that 
I can't comprehend this. 
It'll be a few days before... 
Oh, sure. 
...to even let it soak in. 
COLBY: 
 Returning from Tribal Council 
was the best feeling 
 I've had in 42 days. 
It was a victorious feeling. 
16 of us started, and, and we 
were the two that beat 'em all. 
What else can we burn?
What else? 
Poor Keith.
This would be his 
 favoritest thing to do.
This last immunity, 
 I was a nervous wreck. 
Had Keith won, 
I'm not sure whether or not 
he would have voted for me 
 to stay with him. 
( Colby whistling ) 
Ooh, that's a good fire, Colby. 
COLBY: 
 I think, when it came down 
 to it, more than likely, 
he would've kept Tina on board 
 and gotten rid of me, 
so I needed to keep immunity 
 from Keith. 
That was my only 
 objective last night. 
You're a sore loser. 
That's what I'm realizing. 
You don't like losing. 
I hate losing. 
When's the last time
 you won something? 
Reward challenge. 
It's the last 
time I've won. 
COLBY: 
 Keith might've been 
 the only way 
Tina and I 
 could've gotten here. 
And trust me, 
we tried every way possible 
 to figure out 
how we could vote Keith off 
 instead of Rodger, 
but sometimes, you've got 
 to bring along people 
that you don't 
 necessarily want to. 
TINA: 
 I don't think Keith could've 
made it this far 
 on his own accord. 
You know, 
 we kind of pulled Keith along. 
We needed a third 
 as part of an alliance 
to have a majority vote, 
and we've kept Keith 
 around for that reason. 
He got us where 
we needed to be. 
 Yep. 
And he didn't win 
a million dollars. 
That's the best 
part about it. 
No matter what happens, 
Keith Famie didn't win 
a million bucks. 
I don't think Keith earned 
 the right to sit in a position 
of one of 
 the Final Two in this game. 
I don't think he played 
 the game in a fashion 
or well enough 
 to deserve that spot. 
TINA: 
 All my jobs 
have always been 
 minimum wage jobs,
except for when I was 
 a flight attendant, 
and so I've never 
 felt like I've been
a contributing factor 
 financially. 
You know, however 
 much money it is, 
I've contributed to the family
 financial situation, 
and it just makes me
 feel so good. 
And you earned it, you worked 
 hard for it, you know? 
Good night,
 my friend. 
( Colby groans ) 
Good morning. 
Mm, you're warm.
COLBY: 
 It's a great day. 
I mean, and it 
 is only going to get better 
each hour that-that goes by, 
and we realize we're 
 one step closer to tonight. 
I mean, it's awesome. 
Mission accomplished. 
I mean, we've done 
 everything we can. 
TINA: 
 I felt joy. I felt peace. 
I began to feel closure 
 for the first time. 
I want to spend the day taking 
 some visual pictures, 
capturing those 
to take 'em home with me. 
COLBY: 
 You can see over everything. 
This is the appropriate place 
 for Tina and I to be. 
The highest peak that we could 
 see or climb to from our camp. 
Getting as high as we can 
 and literally feeling like 
you're on top of the world 
 in more ways than one. 
They're everywhere up here. 
One, two, three, four, five, 
 six, seven... 
And here's some more. 
 ...eight, nine, ten. 
TINA: 
 God, they're fast,
 aren't they? 
COLBY: 
That I'm 
going to miss-- 
just kangaroos running wild. 
TINA: 
 I look at Colby. 
He came here for one thing-- 
to win a million dollars. 
He didn't come here 
 to make friends. 
He didn't come here for any 
 other reason, 
and his actions show that. 
He speaks it. He lives it. 
 He's wide open. 
COLBY: 
 In the game of Survivor, you've
 got to switch hats a lot. 
You got to wear a white hat 
 part of the time, 
and sometimes you got 
 to put on the black hat, 
and that's the only way you 
can do good at this game. 
You got to be 
 the bad guy sometimes. 
You've got to be 
 a little bit selfish, 
but hopefully, in the end, 
you wore a white hat more 
 of the time 
than you did a black hat. 
Tina has played the game better
 than anyone else. 
She hasn't flown 
 under the radar. 
However, she hasn't ruffled 
 any feathers. 
She's stayed on course 
 the entire time. 
I think she knew 
 where she wanted to be 
and how she was gonna get there
 much earlier than I did. 
41 days-- I've realized 
that it is life's subtleties 
that I cherish the most, 
and that's it. 
That's pretty 
 heavy, Colby. 
You did some thinking 
on that little perch. 
I did. 
TINA: 
 How are we gonna
 do the flag? 
I was gonna
 say either 
winner gets it... 
I say... 
 Well, yeah.
Or we play for it. 
COLBY: 
 No, I say 
 winner gets it.
TINA: 
 Okay. 
TINA: 
 I think 
it's important for Colby and I 
 to break down the camp, 
kind of as a tribute. 
( bird squawking ) 
TINA: 
 That bark worked pretty good, 
didn't it, Colby? 
COLBY: 
 It really did.
Shelter turned out... 
 pretty effective. 
TINA: 
 The shelter-- it was built 
 with no food in our system, 
very, very weak bodies. 
That day, building 
that shelter was very, 
 very tough. 
And to take it down now 
is almost like saying, 
"It was worth it, 
 because look where I am. 
"I'm one of the two. 
It was worth it." 
COLBY: 
 The day this 
 structure went up 
was the worst I 
 had ever seen Tina.
It was her 
 all-time low
in the 42 days we've been here. 
TINA: 
I was not only 
physically low. 
I was mentally 
 pretty low, going... 
COLBY: 
 You were 
 done, mentally.
I thought, "How many more days 
 do I have to do this?" 
Because I was worried 
it wasn't gonna get any better. 
That was your worst day. 
COLBY: 
 Winning this game means so much
 to me, 
and is so important to me 
because of the level 
 of difficulty. 
Because it's been so tough 
 to get to this point. 
And it has taken so much 
 out of me-- 
physically, emotionally, 
 mentally. 
But that's why it means so much
 to win this game-- 
'cause I have so much invested 
 in it. 
TINA: 
 What it boils down to is 
did I come here 
 for 42 days to starve, 
to live in the type 
of environment 
 that I've lived in, 
to make those type 
 of sacrifices, 
to give somebody like Elisabeth
 a million dollars. 
Or did I come here 
 to play this game 
and me deserve 
 the million dollars? 
COLBY: 
 I've been selfish 
 in the way I've played. 
However, I'm choosing to go 
 into the finals with Tina, 
and that's not a selfish move, 
'cause if I was 100% selfish, 
I would choose 
 to go in with Keith. 
I feel certain I probably 
 could have won against Keith. 
I don't even know that I have 
 a 50-50 shot against Tina. 
( bird screeching ) 
( screeching ) 
We'll never walk
this road again. 
Nope. 
You ready? 
TINA: 
 Let's go. 
Let's go. Oh. 
It's been great.
Unbelievable. 
Thank you. 
 For everything.
( Colby mumbles, 
 animals chittering ) 
Thank you. 
Rock and roll.
Make tracks.
Don't look back.
RODGER: 
 Well, this is day 42. 
The jury is meeting tonight 
 to decide on the Final Two, and
whoever the winner is, 
 I'll certainly go up 
and shake their hand and, uh... 
and, uh, give 'em... 
 give 'em, uh, congratulations, 
'cause this-this game is not 
 an easy game to play out here. 
I would hope that whoever wins 
 has played the game 
as morally and as ethically 
as is physically possible 
to have done out here 
 in the outback. 
And to tell you the truth, 
 I have not made up my mind yet 
who I'm voting for. 
ALICIA: 
 You know 
 that this night is gonna come, 
and, uh, it all comes down 
 to this. 
I have a few questions 
 lined up, 
and, uh, I can't wait 
 to hear the responses. 
Which of those two is still 
 on their toes, 
still thinking, still focused, 
 still has a clear head 
after everything 
 they've been through. 
And I can't wait to see 
 who that person is. 
AMBER: 
 I'm not really liking 
 the feeling at all, 
the fact that I, uh, 
have the chance right now 
to give a million dollars 
 to somebody. 
I just... I-I hate the feeling, 
 you know. 
I want the million dollars. 
It's come down 
to two very difficult people 
 to choose between. 
KEITH: 
 Everything they've worked for 
 is coming down to tonight. 
That's a big deal. 
That's a lot to think about 
 as they make their way 
walking to Tribal Council. 
If you look at Colby, 
 it's obvious 
that a very, uh, strong, 
competitive, 
 athletic individual 
that knows how to get along 
 with people 
can go very far in this game. 
When I look at Tina, 
 it teaches me 
that an individual doesn't have
 to be the strongest 
to go this far. 
She won no immunities, 
 she won only one reward, 
but she just didn't give up, so
there's one 
that didn't win anything, 
there's one 
 that won almost everything. 
The common thread is 
 to believe in yourself, 
take things day by day, 
 and don't give up. 
NICK: 
 The strange part 
 about this game is that 
you try to build friendships 
 and-and relationships 
and, uh, and still play the game
 and be successful, 
and, uh, it's hard to know 
 whether anybody is genuine. 
Colby is much, uh, 
 more intelligent 
than I thought he was. 
He's definitely been more 
of a thinker in this game 
 than I thought. 
Tina I saw 
 as this kind of innocent person
just going along with the game,
 and now 
I definitely see her 
 as more of a mastermind. 
You know, I think 
 she's been thinking 
since day one what she needed 
 to do, and she's done it well. 
I'm in a position 
 of power again, and I like it. 
So, I'm ready to go and vote. 
The two people 
 that are in the running 
for a million bucks 
 right now are the two people 
who backstabbed me 
about three different 
 separate times. 
I want them 
to be forced to look 
 into what they've become 
in this game, 
 versus who they claim to be 
in their real lives. 
ELISABETH: 
 I would have thought 
 that Colby's competitive nature
would have lead him 
to be voting 
 for Tina last Council. 
And be up against Keith. 
He'd have a much cleaner shot, 
 it would seem. 
Do I think 
 the best person can win? 
I think there's always 
 that possibility. 
Will the best person win? 
Well, that's 
in the hands of... 
a bunch of people 
who think they are the best one.
So, that's the tricky part. 
Now bring in the final 
Tribal Council jury. 
( sighs ) 
42 days, 
and it comes down to this: 
one final Tribal Council. 
You guys have endured floods, 
out-of-control wildfires, 
incredible heat, 
very cold nights, 
and severe hunger. 
But you're sitting here 
as the Final Two 
because you have mastered 
human relationships. 
There's no other way 
you could end up here. 
But those who were voted out, 
our jury, are now in control 
of your fate. 
And if the manner 
 in which they were voted out 
was harsh,
payback could be
 swift and sweet.
That's where we're at tonight. 
There will be one final vote. 
Before we get to that vote, 
we're going to have an exchange.
Here's how it'll work. 
We'll start 
with opening comments 
from the two of you 
to the jury, 
addressing why 
you deserve the million dollars.
The jury then, 
 one by one, will
 ask a question 
to you.
When they're finished, 
 you'll get a chance 
to have a closing comment. 
Then we'll do the vote. 
Before we start, 
I just want to poll the jury. 
Has anybody here shared 
any information 
 with anyone else
in the jury about 
who they're voting
 for tonight? 
No. 
 Absolutely not. 
ALL: 
 No. 
All right, Tina, 
 the floor is yours. 
Strategy played a big part 
in getting here. 
The strategy for Survivor is 
outwit, outplay, outlast. 
I'm not gonna sit here 
and tell you 
why you should vote for me. 
I will say 
the one thing that I hope 
that you don't do 
is that you don't cast your vote
based on 
that you got your feelings hurt.
I think it's poor sportsmanship,
and I don't think 
that it relays 
who the true survivor is. 
It just shows 
that you got your feelings hurt.
So, it's up to you guys 
from here on out. 
It's been a pleasure and a joy. 
I know whenever I go home, 
I go home to a husband 
who treats me like a princess 
 and who I worship and adore, 
and two children 
who I'm so happy 
 to be their mom. 
And that's worth more to me 
 than a million dollars. 
I wish that for all of you. 
Colby, the floor is yours. 
( sighs ) 
Well, I guess 
 we're supposed to... 
make a spiel here about why 
we deserve the 
 million dollars,
or why I deserve
 it over Tina, 
and I don't... I 
 don't know that I do. 
You've got to be a jack 
of all trades, 
but not necessarily 
a master of any, 
and-and that's an old 
 saying that goes way back.
I don't think I was necessarily 
 the best at anything, 
and I don't think I... 
I-I beat Tina in strategy, 
or any elements 
of the game, but I... 
I feel like I did them all 
pretty good. 
And that's why I'm here. 
JEFF: 
All right, 
jury, take
 a moment. 
Collect 
 your thoughts.
You're gonna each 
 have the opportunity
to ask Tina and 
 Colby a question
that will help
 you decide 
who will be the
 sole survivor. 
All right, I'll turn it over 
 to the jury. 
You're free to ask Colby 
and Tina anything you want. 
Rodger, we'll 
 start with you.
Well, Tina, Colby, a big night 
 for both of you, 
I know. 
There's been some times 
when you have not always 
 told the truth, 
had to lie on occasions. 
That's part of the strategy 
 of playing the game. 
I'd like 
for both of you maybe 
to give me a couple of instances
where you did not 
tell the truth, 
and then, do you feel 
that you have played the game 
as ethically 
as you possibly could have? 
Wow. 
Tina, we'll 
 start with you.
TINA: 
 Okay. 
I think as far 
as not telling the truth, 
for me personally would come 
 in to play 
whenever someone would come 
 to me, 
like let's say Amber, 
 because Amber was the one who 
usually would come to us 
before every Tribal Council 
and say, "Okay, 
who are we voting for?" 
And at the point 
that it was Amber's time to go, 
I don't... we didn't tell Amber 
and say, 
"Okay, Amber, you're the one 
who's going out tonight." 
So, that would be an incidence 
 of when the truth wasn't told. 
And as far 
as ethically is concerned, 
in playing this game, 
I don't think you can win it 
by saying, "Well, 
"you know, 
that's a nice person. 
I don't want 
to vote that person off." 
I think you have 
to have more of 
 a strategic mind. 
But I don't feel like 
that was unethical by any means.
And so by my definition, I feel 
 like I've played ethically. 
Colby? 
Dishonesty.
I have one... 
moment that came
 to mind was 
when I told Jerri if 
 we went into the merge
with the upper hand 
as far as voting 
and we took over, 
that she and-and Amber 
and I would take this thing on, 
and... 
and that didn't happen. 
And-And that was one... 
one point of dishonesty there 
'cause I told 
 her that. 
And as far 
 as-as ethics go,
if being 
 dishonest 
makes me less ethical, 
then-then maybe I had a struggle
with ethics on this thing. 
Amber. 
Well, here we are. 
Um, my question is, 
what three things got you 
to this point? 
And if you were 
 to win the million dollars, 
what are the first three things 
you're going to do 
with that million dollars? 
JEFF: 
Colby, we'll start 
with you. 
Uh, first was... 
 would be the refusal 
at any point
to ever mentally 
 check out of the game.
Meaning, just 
 keeping my head
in it the entire time.
Strategizing from day 
 one on till-till day 42.
Second thing, water.
I mean, that was the
 only thing that... 
that kept me from 
 getting hunger pains
was fooling my... 
 fooling my stomach
into thinking 
 it was full by
filling it with water. 
Um, three. 
Taking time out to enjoy. 
I mean, you could have 
 gone mad... 
You could have gone mad 
 in this game 
if you didn't 
 every now and then 
realize where you were 
and how lucky we
 were to be here.
And the first three 
 things I'd spend it on.
Uh, I'd love to buy
 a Harley Davidson, 
would die to have 
 one of those. 
Two, uh, my dad has
 restored an antique
office building that he's going 
to have to sell 
because of financial reasons, 
and I would love to 
buy that building 
without him knowing
 I purchased it, 
and-and give 
 it back to him.
And also, financially,
 take care of my mom. 
Those three things.
Tina? 
TINA: 
 The three 
 things that
got me here was strategy. 
I think Colby. 
I think he had a... 
a big part. 
I mean, last night 
he could have voted me off, 
but he didn't, so 
Colby definitely got me here. 
And the third, 
I'd say, heart slash God. 
And the three things
 I would like to do 
with the million, the 
 first three things is,
pay off my house, 
pay off my best friend's house, 
and Elisabeth gave me 
 a fantastic idea 
about setting up a fund, 
putting money in that fund, 
and the interest 
that it draws, 
spend it one time a year 
for a family that's in need. 
And I thought 
that was one of the best ideas 
I've ever heard. 
Okay. 
Elisabeth. 
The theme of deserving 
has woven its way 
 into many Councils. 
If you had the power to give 
five of the jury members here 
before you this 
 million dollar prize, 
what are the names-- 
 no explanation-- 
what are the names 
 of the two 
that you would exclude 
 from that prize? 
JEFF: 
Tina, we'll start 
with you. 
( Colby scoffs )
Jerri and Rodger. 
JEFF: 
Colby? 
Jerri...
and Keith.
JEFF: 
Keith. 
Well, guys, 
I've played this game 
with you for 41 days. 
I know 
how political it is 
and how political 
 it-it becomes, and 
I also know that manipulation 
comes into play. 
Each of you give me 
an instance 
where you used manipulation 
to get you 
where you're at 
right now.
JEFF: 
 Colby.
COLBY:
 Um... 
when Tina and I,
 on the way to 
 Tribal Council, 
decided to vote
 Mitchell off 
and break an alliance, 
thus, manipulating 
 the whole setting 
to first get the 
 team to the merge 
stronger, thus getting me 
 farther in the game. 
JEFF: 
 Tina. 
TINA: 
 I would say the 
 exact same thing. 
Like Colby, I knew 
 that if we made the decision 
to vote you off 
 and keep Mitchell, that 
it made our 
 team weaker.
You can call it
manipulation if you want to. 
I prefer to call it strategy. 
Alicia.
Uh, it's nice to see you guys, 
and I want to congratulate 
 you both on a job well done. 
A lot of things 
have happened. 
I'm sure there's a lot of things
that you both probably 
 would like to forget 
and a lot of things 
you never want to forget. 
And in light of that, 
I have a two-part question 
for you. 
What I want to know is, 
what one particular thing 
are you personally 
 most proud of, 
and on the flip side of that, 
least proud of, 
personally? 
Tina. 
TINA: 
 I think I am
 most proud 
of maybe the role 
 I've played here. 
There are some things 
that I did... 
as a tribe member that I felt 
like were extremely giving, 
such as giving Keith 
the immunity challenge 
when we were standing 
on those poles. 
My least proud moment... 
would be probably 
 every Tribal Council. 
Whenever I had to 
 vote somebody off,
I never felt good 
about doing that. 
COLBY: 
 Uh... least 
 proud moment
is probably... today, 
 for the first time realizing 
how little respect I've shown 
this land 
 where we are. 
I mean, my head
 has been in the
 game so much, 
I realized today how
 little I've stopped 
to smell the roses, 
and I wasn't very proud of that,
because it's taking it 
for granted, um... 
My most proud moment was 
 just a very... 
a very simple... few seconds 
 when I won 
an immunity
 challenge, 
filling the 
 water buckets up, 
 simply because 
I was in dead last
 at the beginning 
of that challenge,
 and I remember 
 telling myself, 
"If you dig 
 deep on this, 
"if you dig as deep 
as you can go, 
you can pull 
this thing out," 
and that was 
 a proud moment for me. 
Thank you. 
Nick. 
NICK: 
First I want to say 
I think you guys 
have both played 
a hell of a game, 
and, uh... I have a lot 
of respect for both of you. 
After you guys gave me the boot,
 um, there was a lot of talk 
in the following Tribal Councils
about people deserving 
to be around, 
which is interesting to me, 
 because, 
had it not been 
for a very unfortunate accident,
then in all likelihood, 
 neither of you two 
would be sitting
 here right now. 
So my question is this:
 if Mike had never had 
his accident, who would 
be sitting in your place-- 
which two people-- 
and why? 
JEFF: 
Colby. 
 And this is 
going to sound
 like a lot of 
 schmooze, 
but one of those 
 two people I think
 would be you. 
And I don't know 
 what happened 
 before the merge, 
but I know when 
 we came together, 
you had the 
 mental game going 
and were ready to 
 take it on to the end.
Uh, and...
seeing the way 
Mike helped you guys out 
in just about every... 
every, uh... challenge 
we faced y'all in, 
I mean, 
I don't know the guy, 
 but I'd say he had 
a pretty good shot at 
 being in the end, too.
I mean, obviously,
we'll never know, 
 but I'd think 
if we went into the merge 
 different, 
and you guys had the upper hand,
I'd say it was probably going 
 to be you two guys. 
JEFF: 
 Tina. 
TINA: 
 Because I didn't
really get a chance 
to know you all that well 
and to get the dynamics 
of what went on, 
I really can't answer 
that question. 
I do think 
that the way that you 
all described him 
and some of the actions 
that he took, 
there's probably no doubt 
 in my mind that Mike would be 
one of the people 
 sitting up here. 
Jerri. 
During the course of this game, 
you have had to make 
and break promises. 
You've had 
to manipulate. 
I want to allow you to... 
clear your conscience... 
by bringing up 
any moments 
during the course 
of this game 
that you might have felt 
 some sense of guilt, 
remorse or regret 
for something you might've done 
to another person. 
JEFF: 
Tina. 
I think one of the things, 
or the thing 
 that I feel worst about 
was the day that we came back 
 to the Ogakor Tribe, 
and Kel had been accused 
of eating the 
 beef jerky. 
And someone said, 
 "Well, check his bag," 
and I was standing there 
 by his bag 
and opening up the bag 
to look in there 
to see if we saw 
beef jerky wrappers. 
Afterwards, I thought, 
"Oh, I wish I hadn't
 been standing there,
and I wish that 
 hadn't been me."
And so, that's the one thing 
 that I feel worst about. 
Colby. 
I think guilt-guilty 
 would be the word 
that... that
 I would use 
f-for a couple
 of instances. 
I feel guilty about,
um... Rodger and Elisabeth. 
I wish there was a way 
strategically 
that we could've played 
differently. 
And Alicia. 
You know, there were 
 a lot of reasons 
for voting off 
 a lot of people, 
but Alicia was the first one 
out of all of y'all to go, 
and it was simply based 
on her being a 
 physical threat,
and I think... 
 I think that's 
 shallow as hell,
and I feel guilty 
 about that, 
but I don't... 
I don't have any regrets. 
I feel guilty 
 about a lot of things, but... 
but I don't have any regrets. 
JEFF: 
I'm going to give 
you guys both a chance 
to address them 
 one last time. 
Colby, last words. 
Not a lack of respect to anyone,
but I... I don't have any. 
Tina, last words. 
When you play backgammon 
 like we played countless games 
of backgammon together, 
you don't go 
into backgammon and say, 
"Okay, I'm going to leave 
this man open." 
You know you have 
to cover that man. 
That's the strategy. 
And it's the same thing 
 with this game. 
There was never 
 anything personal 
about voting 
anybody off. 
There was 
a strategy. 
And that's all it is. 
JEFF: 
All right. 
You've had a chance 
to ask your questions, 
gather your 
 information.
Now it's in your
 hands, so take 
a moment to consider
whether it's going 
 to be Colby or Tina
who leaves the 
 outback one million
 dollars richer. 
It's now time 
for our final vote. 
Normally, at 
 Tribal Council,
you're voting 
 against someone.
You're voting somebody
 out of the tribe. 
Tonight, it's 
 flip-flopped. 
Tonight, you are 
 voting for somebody.
You guys are going 
to be writing down 
the name of the person 
you think 
deserves 
the million dollars. 
Rodger, we'll start 
with you. 
This was a very, very, 
 very tough decision for me. 
I like both people. 
I think they both have played 
 the game extremely well. 
I do, however, think 
 that Colby probably played 
the game a little harder. 
I just think 
 he has turned out to be 
the ultimate survivor 
 in this... in this game. 
ALICIA: 
 Let me just say 
that in the game of life, 
 Colby would be the one 
I would probably 
 most likely gravitate to, 
but this is the game 
 of Survivor, 
and I think Tina 
 is more deserving 
because she has 
 really played this game. 
It wasn't winning seven 
 or eight challenges 
that got her here. 
It was strategy 
 and using her head. 
She's a smart woman, 
 and I think she deserves it. 
AMBER: 
 Tina, you've come 42 days. 
You haven't received 
 a vote yet, 
but you won't be receiving 
 your first vote from me. 
Uh, Colby gets my vote tonight. 
I feel that Colby's been 
 more straightforward with me 
and, uh, played 
 the game better. 
So, Colby, 
you win this. 
Congratulations, buddy. 
JERRI: 
 It's been very clear to me 
from the very beginning 
 that Tina, 
you have been the mastermind 
behind all of the strategies 
 that have taken place, 
and your greatest strategy 
 of all 
was getting Colby 
 to pick you over Keith 
to be sitting 
 where you're sitting right now,
so I can't help but have a 
great sense of respect for that.
JEFF: 
I'll go get the votes. 
Inside this container 
 are seven votes. 
It's a culmination
 of 42 days 
in the outback. 
For one of you, the votes 
inside this container 
represent 
$100,000 prize, 
but for the other person, 
the votes inside here represent 
a million-dollar prize 
and the title 
of Survivor: 
 The Australian Outback. 
I know you've waited a long time
for this moment... 
and you're going to wait 
a little longer. 
These votes will be sealed 
 and revealed live 
when we return 
 to the United States. 
I'll see all of you there. 
 So long. 
( helicopter whirring ) 
( cheering and applause ) 
( cheering and applause ) 
We're not worthy. 
Well, this is pretty cool, huh? 
( Colby whooping, 
 Tina laughing ) 
We are a far cry 
from the world 
we left behind 
so long ago-- 
 the Australian Outback. 
Beautiful, 
but very harsh terrain, 
great wildlife, 
and just truly an organic nature
for the 42 days 
you guys spent out there. 
To this 
very surreal 
and yet still authentic, 
 new Survivor world, 
where a very dramatic 
conclusion is going to play out 
to a great game.
You guys have 
 waited a long time.
We're going 
to get to the votes 
in mere moments, 
I promise you. 
But... I got to ask. 
You've had a long time 
 to think about 
this night. 
I'm imagining 
a lot of anxiousness, 
maybe one or two 
sleepless nights 
of anticipation. 
Now that we're here 
 at this moment of truth, 
what is coursing 
through your body 
 and your brain? 
Colby, you just took 
a sort of a deep breath there. 
What's this feel like? 
I think that's the first breath 
I've taken in two hours. Uh-oh. 
( laughter ) 
I don't... I... 
 Jeff, I don't know. 
I don't know that 
 I can put it 
into words
 right now,
but I'm anxious. 
This is... 
 this is the way it should be. 
How about you, 
Tina? You were... 
The whole time out there, 
you were very calm, 
close to the chest. 
You, you look that way now. 
You're very subdued. 
I'm very emotional. 
We've been watching backstage 
 and just crying. 
And I feel so close 
 to everybody here, 
and I think 
that's one thing
that's so special 
 between all of us 
is that no matter 
 what happens tonight, 
we leave a close- 
 knit group. 
You know, one 
of the great things 
I think, anyway,
 about Survivor 
is that it offers you 
 perspective. 
I mean, how often 
do you get 
a chance 
where you get 
to have 
16 strangers 
together 
who are going 
to ultimately 
give you their opinion-- 
 what they think about you,
how you play, 
how you interact socially, 
who you are 
as a person. 
And then you get 
to watch it play out, 
learn what they think about you,
 and also view yourself 
and maybe gain some new insight 
 into your own 
self-perception. 
Had we read 
these votes in Australia, 
moments after the jury 
 cast them, 
you'd have no chance 
 for reflection. 
It'd happen 
immediately. 
You've had a lot of time 
 for reflection. 
As you watch 
that final day 
and the final Tribal Council 
 play out, 
any second- 
 guessing going on 
about how 
 you played it?
Any Monday morning
 quarterbacking-- 
"I wish I'd have..."? 
Tina? 
Not for me. 
I think 
 that there's so many things 
that come 
 into playing this game. 
Part of it's luck, 
part of it's 
 strategy, you know?
So, there are 
 so many things
that could have happened 
that would have swung 
 the other way, 
and I would not be sitting here.
And I feel like, 
 as far as I'm concerned, 
I did what I could to get here. 
And the rest of it was luck. 
How about you, 
Colby? 
Well, 
I... It was no shocker 
that I didn't get Jerri's vote 
 on that, 
but I realize now I should have 
sucked up to Alicia 
a little more. 
That one threw me 
by surprise. 
Uh... 
But no. 
I'm just... 
 man, let's get it on. 
I'm excited. 
( audience laughter ) 
JEFF: 
You guys, Keith 
made an interesting point. 
He said, "You know, 
 you both bring 
such different strategies 
 and strengths to this, 
and yet you find yourself, 
both of you, in
 the final two."
And I really sensed,
especially in the last day, 
 a true camaraderie. 
Bond still strong 
between you guys 
as you sit here knowing 
only one is going to win? 
Incredible. 
 Absolutely. 
And man, that's
 the neat thing.
I don't care 
 how many Survivors you have, 
you'll never be able 
 to predict 
who the winner's going to be, 
because there are 
so many dynamics involved. 
And it doesn't matter 
 how dominant you are, 
either physically 
 or strategically, 
it doesn't matter 
 when it all plays out. 
That's what matters.
I mean that's...
 there are so 
 many elements, 
and that's what's fun.
That's what's exciting
 about this. 
JEFF: 
Let's get to the vote. 
 Let's do it. 
Jury, I just want to make sure 
nobody in the jury 
has revealed 
 to anyone else
the vote you 
 made that night.
You don't know,
 you don't know.
Seven votes inside here-- 
 that means that 
in a moment, somebody's going 
to leave this stage 
with, among other things, 
a Pontiac Aztec-- which, Colby, 
would be a matching one for you 
to go with the first one 
you won out there. 
Also, the last 
remaining item 
from Camp Barramundi-- 
 the Survivor flag. 
You guys made a deal 
 when you said, you know what? 
Winner takes it. 
A great reminder 
of the high highs 
and the very low lows, 
and I'm happy to report 
 it still has just enough aroma 
that it will take you 
right back there. 
You'll also 
leave the stage 
with a check 
 in the amount of $1 million. 
Runner-up 
gets 100 grand. 
And maybe, 
now looking back 
on the last 42 days-- 
 maybe the most coveted thing-- 
the winner earns the title 
of Survivor: 
 the Australian Outback, 
and well-deserved. 
So, 
with that, 
seven votes. 
Takes four to win. 
Remember, in this final vote, 
 you want your name 
on this parchment. 
The jury did not vote 
 somebody out. 
They voted 
for a winner. 
Take 
a deep breath. 
Let's read 
the votes. 
Mmm. This is good. 
( laughter ) 
First vote. 
Tina. 
Two votes Tina. 
It takes 
four votes 
to win. 
Third vote... 
Colby. 
Two votes Tina,
 one vote Colby.
Colby. 
That's two votes Tina, 
two votes Colby. 
( laughter ) 
Three votes Colby, 
two votes Tina. 
One more vote, Colby, 
and it's yours. 
( laughter ) 
Told you! 
JEFF: 
 It doesn't get any
 better than this. 
Three votes Tina. 
Three votes Colby. 
In true Survivor 
tradition, 
it comes down 
to one 
final vote. 
The winner of Survivor: 
 The Australian Outback... 
( screaming and applause ) 
 Yeah! Yeah! 
( cheering and applause ) 
Come here!
Whoo! Yeah! 
( Survivor theme playing ) 
Thank you, Jeff. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Come on over, guys. 
I'll give this 
to you, Tina. 
( cheering and applause )
