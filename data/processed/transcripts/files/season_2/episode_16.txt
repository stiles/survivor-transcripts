        ( cheering and applause ) 
Whoo! Whoo! 
Yeah! 
Yeah. 
Right here. 
Nice. Nice.
Nice. 
Good evening 
 and welcome back. 
It is a long way 
 from the Australian Outback 
to our L.A. soundstage, 
where our castaways
 are tonight 








surrounded by 
 an audience 
of family, 
 friends, and fans.
Let's welcome 
individually, starting 
with our two finalists, 
 Tina Wesson, 
Colby Donaldson.
Then the jurors
with whom we 
 are all familiar. 
The outback's 
 resident chef,
 Keith Famie, 
the ever so sweet 
Elisabeth Filarski, her
 buddy Rodger Bingham, 
the youngest
 castaway, 
22-year-old 
 Amber Brkich, 
Harvard law 
 student Nick Brown,








the controversial 
 Jerri Manthey... 
( laughter )
and the oh-so-buff
 Alicia Calaway. 
And reuniting 
with their former 
 tribe mates 
for the first time
since their days
 in the outback, 
cheerleader 
 Jeff Varner,
burn victim 
 Michael Skupin,
vegetarian Kimmi
 Kappenberg, 
the seven-footer, 
 Mitchell Olson, 
Maralyn "Mad Dog" 
 Hershey, 
Captain Kel Gleason,
 and the first to go,
Debb Eaton.
Good evening, 
 everybody. 
ALL: 
 Good evening, Bryant. 
( cheering and applause ) 
Well, Ms. Wesson, 
what have you got 
 to say for yourself?
Oh, I just never believed it. 
GUMBEL: 
 Oh, come on.
I never believed it. 
Never once. 
I never even thought 
about the voting process, 
who might be voting for who. 
How could you 
 go these months 
 without thinking
about it even one time? 
Whenever Colby and I came back 
 to camp that night after 
Keith was gone, 
 we felt like we had won, 
because this is what 
 we wanted to do 
whenever 
 we joined 
with each other in alliance. 
This is what we wanted to do. 
We wanted to make it 
 to the last two. 
And that was winning for me. 
Yeah, but 
 we're talking 
about a 
 difference of 
considerable jack 
between winning 
 and being runner-up. 
( laughter ) 
 It was not about the money. 
$900,000 In fact. 
Yeah, nine... 
( laughter ) 
GUMBEL: 
 But who's 
 counting? 
Hey. 
 If this game 
had been for free, 
I would have done it. 
If there was no prize at all, 
 for free, 
I would have gone out 
 and played this game. 
Yeah? 
GUMBEL: 
Why did you do it, Colby? 
I mean, why did you do it? 
You-You know? 
It was a pretty 
 magnanimous gesture.
Oh, 
why did I choose Tina? 
GUMBEL:
 Yeah. 
Oh, well... Uh, no. 
I thought you were asking 
 something else. Um... 
( laughter ) 
Well, there are a lot 
 of reasons, 
and I knew... and I know... 
I've thought about this, 
 and tried to come up 
with something intelligent 
 to say because I knew 
I'd be asked this question. 
 Uh... 
( laughter ) 
You know, and... 
and Tina's right, and... 
And it... it's... 
It gets said so many times, 
that I was so driven to win 
and-and you know, 
I was so focused, and I was. 
I was very intense 
with what I wanted to do, 
but-but the game changes 
 for everyone, and 
it did change for me, 
 and when Tina and I... 
we started becoming close, 
and it... and it 
really started when-when we, 
 um, voted Mitchell off 
instead of Keith. 
That's when we decided 
to play our game, and we did. 
We took this thing 
 on in to the end. Uh... 
And-And that night was a victory
for us when we got 
to go back together. 
And... you know, the thing is, 
even though when I chose Tina 
 to go with me 
into the 
 end, um, 
thus making it 
much more competitive 
on the final vote,
 I've been able 
to sleep every night since then.
I haven't lost one night 
of sleep worrying about 
whether or not I would win, 
 because she deserved it. 
And that's the beauty 
 of this game. 
It doesn't matter 
how many challenges I won 
or how many beans 
and stew I ate all the time. 
It doesn't matter, 
 because it comes down 
to the game itself, 
 and-and there's a whole lot... 
There are so many factors 
 involved, 
and people can't 
 understand that. 
Yeah. 
 I don't expect them to. 
Keith, how shocked were you 
when he said bye to you 
 instead of to Tina? 
( clears throat ) 
You know, the last five days 
 of the game 
were fairly enlightening 
 for me 
just from a life standpoint. 
And I really felt that, 
you know, this game really 
 wasn't about money. 
I gained a lot more out of it.
Absolutely. 
I told my two very special 
 people in my life, 
Josh and Alicia, 
my kids, that, uh... 
And of course Katrine 
 my fianc?e now 
that I was just gonna do 
the best I could do.
Do the best
 I could do.
And that's all I planned 
 on doing, the best I could do. 
I told my mom that. 
 Do the best I could do 
with the game, and... 
 GUMBEL: 
 But here's a guy
sitting next to you 
 who basically 
gave up $900,000
because he didn't 
 want you to have it.
( laughter ) 
Well, you know, 
call Colby a fool then. 
No. You know what? 
I think that... 
And I-I agree with Colby, too. 
You know, I... 
 I'll be honest with you. 
If I would have, uh... 
I would have probably 
 picked Tina 
to be in it in the end with me. 
If I had won that immunity 
challenge, I would have probably
voted Colby out, knowing 
that Tina realistically 
 would have beaten me. 
I think Tina... 
It-It... The game changes 
dramatically. 
When we had that flood, 
 the time that flood hit, 
the game was off. 
This was now about survival, 
living conditions, 
who you can cohabitate with 
and just the... and 
being able 
 to build relationships. 
And for me, it was, a... 
Tina just really deserved it. 
I felt she deserved it. 
But you weren't
 uncomfortable? 
 I mean, we were
listening to some of the things 
they were talking about. 
 They said, 
"Keith didn't 
 earn the right."
"We dragged
 him along."
"He didn't deserve the spot." 
"We put up 
 with him." 
 Oh, oh, that. 
"We used him."
Trust... 
 I mean, 
 come on. 
Trust me. 
Colby can play the game 
 mentally better than anybody. 
That stuff hurt. 
But, uh, 
I think that in-in the scope 
 of the game, 
in the scope of the game, 
when it comes down 
 to the last three, 
when a decision 
 like that is made, it's huge. 
Yeah. 
And you've got to really 
 have some val... 
pretty valuable 
good decisions why then... 
All right, Tina got.. 
 Tina got four votes. 
Um, Jerri, Keith, we can assume.
Who are the
 other two? 
Alicia and
 Elisabeth?
Yep. 
 Is that right?
Why Tina? 
ALICIA: 
 Was it you, 
 Elisabeth? 
Yeah. 
 Why Tina? 
Because I think 
 Tina just put 
 it all together.
Everybody said what 
 was exactly the truth,
that she had a strategy 
 coming into this. 
She played it until the very, 
 very end, 
and she didn't win 
 any challenges, not one, so... 
GUMBEL: 
 You hold that against 
 Colby that he did? 
Not at all, but 
 she had to be doing
 something right 
to make it that far
 and be Final Two, 
and that's strategy. 
And it wasn't about 
winning challenges, it 
 was about strategizing.
And that's 
 what this is all about. 
And I think she deserved it.
GUMBEL: 
 Elisabeth?
ELISABETH: 
I said when I voted, 
this was the most 
difficult vote 
 that I had to make 
because the two people 
 sitting there, 
I had just developed 
 such a respect and love for 
in the outback as people. 
And I knew Colby's... 
Colby's potential is 
 outstanding, 
and I also knew that Tina 
um... 
had decided, you know, 
prior to all the voting 
 that, you know, 
what she was going to do 
 with the money. 
I just really took heart to, 
 I really did. 
And as we all know, I'm 
an emotional person, so... 
GUMBEL: 
 Yes, you are. 
Guess how I voted? 
By my heart. 
GUMBEL: 
 We're looking at the
 Colby voting block 
right behind you there,
with Rodger, Amber and
 Nick, why Colby, guys?
NICK: 
 Well, at least 
 for me, I mean,
if you make it 
 to the Final Two, 
it's not easy to say 
 who deserved it more 
and who played the game better. 
I mean, they did it differently 
 to get to the Final Two. 
But, for me, I just voted 
 for the person who I thought, 
outside the context of the game,
who really tried 
 to get to know me. 
And at that point in the game, 
 Colby and I had conversated 
about a number of things 
 and I just felt we related. 
GUMBEL: 
 It didn't help
 that he said 
you'd have been the one 
 sitting there if he wasn't?
The question 
 played a part of it, 
because he didn't quite 
 answer it, but, uh... 
Amber, Rodger, what about it? 
Why Colby?
AMBER: 
 It was a hard decision. 
With Elisabeth, I was going back
and forth the whole entire day. 
And up until 
 the last minute before, 
even after I asked my question, 
 they both gave great answers. 
The Harley and then the charity,
 you know. 
GUMBEL: 
 Rodger, what about you?
AMBER: 
 But... I'm sorry. 
GUMBEL: 
 Go ahead. 
AMBER: 
 I just... 
 I don't know. 
I just went with my gut, 
and I just thought Colby had... 
I mean, he had played so awesome
and had won 
 all those challenges. 
I mean, he won 
every single immunity 
besides two, I think, and I just
 think that's incredible. 
And I don't know... 
RODGER: 
 For me, it was 
 a very, very hard vote. 
And even after I voted 
 for Colby, 
which has been 
 several weeks now, I think, 
"Oh, I should have voted 
 for Tina," 
and then I think, 
 "No, I was right." 
And I switched 
back and forth. 
And I was glad to see it come 
down to a 4-3 vote tonight 
'cause that says a lot 
about both of those individuals 
sitting there tonight. 
Colby, is there something 
 wrong with the game-- 
I know Mark Burnett's 
 sitting out here. 
He's upset at me
 for asking this.
But is there something
 wrong with a game 
that you dominate so thoroughly 
 and don't win? 
No, absolutely not. 
RODGER: 
He's 30 years younger 
than me, that's why. 
GUMBEL: 
 Me, too. 
 Don't worry about it. 
You and I are the same age, 
 so let's not do this. 
In a lot of it, I mean, 
 I was very fortunate. 
Let's put things 
 into perspective. 
If Mike's accident 
 hadn't happened, 
I wouldn't be sitting 
in the top two, that's for sure.
You know, there are a lot of 
very fortunate instances. 
GUMBEL: 
 And there's one final thing
 that we should share 
for the first time tonight 
 that nobody knows, 
which is two weeks before this 
got started, you weren't going. 
COLBY: 
 That's right. 
GUMBEL: 
 You weren't on 
 this, were you?
No, sir, I was not.
I was not picked 
 for the original show.
GUMBEL: 
 You were in reserve.
I was an alternate. 
And I was so disappointed, 
 I got to tell you. 
And my husband kept saying, 
"Honey, they're going 
 to call you back." 
And I'm, like, "They're not 
 going to call me back, honey. 
They already made 
 their decision." 
Three days that went on, 
and they called me back 
 on Monday. 
GUMBEL: 
 How good is that? 
How good is that? 
GUMBEL: 
 Hey, sit tight. 
 We're going to come back
in just a moment 
 because as all our castaways 
can readily attest, 
 their time in Australia 
truly was about survival 
 of the most basic sort. 
When we come back, we'll talk 
about the hunger 
 and the hardships 
they all endured in the outback.
We're back after this. 
( cheering and applause ) 
One of the most important 
 survival tips 
that I can give you 
is that you must be agile enough
to get up in the tree canopies 
just like the koala bears 
to get that precious fruit. 
( screams ) 
( laughter ) 
Oh... 
It worked.
 There you go. 
It worked-- it 
 got you onboard.
But you said they were cheesy. 
 You were mean... 
You're right, it wasn't... 
 You're right. 
I did, but you
 know what? 
The other little secret 
 we should tell 
is this guy was supposed 
 to be part of the first one... 
and, um, didn't
 quite make it, 
and so they put him
 on the second one. 
You were... you 
 were supposed to
 go head-to-head 
with Richard, 
 weren't you? 
I was, and actually, 
I'm glad 
that I had an opportunity to do 
 the Australian Outback. I... 
This-- the bond I've made 
with these individuals 
 has been... is lifelong. 
It's-it's memorable, and it'll 
 be forever-- it's great. 
We're going to talk 
 friends and enemies 
 in our next segment.
I want to try to talk, 
 if I could, 
hunger and hardships, um, 
 for a little while, 
because it was 
 tough out there-- 
at least it 
 appeared to us
as we were 
 watching it.
Nobody suffered a 
 greater hardship 
perhaps than 
 the gentleman 
 in the back row.
Michael, first of all, 
 show us your hands. 
Not bad. Not bad. 
( applause ) 
MICHAEL: 
 I'm real fortunate. 
GUMBEL: 
 I think any of us who saw this 
 will not soon forget it. 
Um, but you've said 
 in a funny kind of way, 
it was something good 
 that happened to you. 
How come? 
MICHAEL: 
 You know, y-your motivations 
for going on the show 
 are so much different 
at the beginning, and like 
 people have been talking about,
you know, what happens just... 
it-it transcend-transcends 
money or prizes or anything. 
And the-the-the spiritual growth
 and the family growth... 
I mean, my kids and my wife 
and my mom and just everybody-- 
it's just... it's-it's 
the greatest experience, and... 
what happened 
to me was... 
A million bucks couldn't buy it.
( applause ) 
I believe...
I believe it was Colby who said 
that the environment 
 and the elements 
were the 
 dominant factors
in this competition-- 
 would any of you 
quibble with that? 
No, not at all. 
 No. 
Not at all. 
 No. 
GUMBEL: 
 Was the... was the 
 tube able to translate
how tough it was
out there, Jeff? 
Um, well, I can't speak 
for how it was 
 after I left, but... 
( laughing ) 
And it seemed to get 
a lot harder after I left. 
GUMBEL:
 Yeah. 
 I mean, for us, 
we were fortunate at Kucha 
 to be kicking Ogakor's butt, 
so we had lots of food. 
GUMBEL: 
 Can we... can 
 we explain 
what the names for
 the tribes were 
when you were 
 out there? 
Um, Kucha is, uh, 
kangaroo, and Ogakor... 
GUMBEL: 
 No, no, no, no, no.
What did you call 'em? 
Oh... 
Oh, you mean 
in the dressing room? 
GUMBEL:
 Yeah. 
 Oga-boring. 
Oh! 
 Oga-boring. 
KEITH: 
Hey, Jeff, 
the game's over, man. 
The game's over, Jeff. 
Still drawing the line. 
( laughter ) 
How bad was the hunger, Nick? 
NICK: 
 You know, I never ever 
felt hungry after day one, 
but you're just weak. 
You get up to do anything, 
 and you're weak, 
and you get dizzy. 
And the day I got kicked off, 
I stood up and just got dizzy 
and couldn't do anything. 
And that never really translates
on the television, but... 
JERRI: 
 They weren't as 
 hungry as we were.
NICK: 
 We weren't as hungry as them. 
JERRI: 
 That's the issue. 
Kucha never experienced hunger 
 the way that Ogakor had to. 
And they didn't experience it-- 
for the people that stayed 
 till the end-- 
until after I left, 
 at that point, 
when there was 
 a-a cup of rice left. 
And I watched Elisabeth start 
 going through the same things 
that we had gone through 
 at the beginning of the game. 
I watched Nick experience it, 
and... I thought
it was kind of funny, 
 but, uh... 
( laughter ) 
Sweet justice. 
GUMBEL: 
 Cruella DeVil had nothing 
 on you, darling. 
Yes, yes, Mad Dog?
MARALYN: 
Bryant, um, after a couple days,
my stomach was shrinking. 
Uh, I was losing weight, 
 feeling good. 
If only I could've stayed there 
 for a couple more weeks, 
I'd be wearing a thong. 
( cheering ) 
Mitchell, Mitchell, 
 correct me if I'm wrong, 
but you were among 
 a few people here 
who kind of thought that, 
 when the cameras were off,
the crew would... 
 would feed you, right?
MITCHELL: 
Right, right. 
Throw you an apple or something.
You would've thought
 they'd flip you 
an apple or a banana? 
At least that, right? 
 Especially for me. 
Look at me. 
 I'm seven feet tall. 
I weigh, like, a buck ten. 
So I think it definitely hit me 
faster than it hit anybody else,
and-and I know that that was 
probably the reason of my exit. 
( laughter ) 
GUMBEL: 
 Rodger, was that 
 the worst part of it? 
RODGER: 
Oh, yes, sir. 
We went one, uh, stretch 
 out there for about 34 hours 
without anything to eat, 
 and-and then when we did eat, 
it was, like, a, uh, third, 
 uh, of a cup of rice. 
And I remember Thanksgiving Day,
 uh, Day, 
Nick had been keeping a-a 
calendar, and all we had to eat 
Thanksgiving Day was some, 
 uh, uh, macadamia nuts. 
So that'll-that'll be 
 a Thanksgiving 
I'll-I'll never forget. 
GUMBEL: 
 Yeah. Boredom was... 
boredom was a part of it. 
Um, lack of companionship, 
 shall we say, 
um, was another
 part of it. 
Kimmi, I had heard a rumor... 
I had heard a rumor-- 
you can just... you 
 can confirm or deny-- 
that, um, you were going 
 to do a birthday suit bash. 
Yes, I said I would. 
I said I was going to, 
in Survivor tradition, you know,
go out and, um, go in my 
 birthday suit on my birthday, 
and you guys voted me out 
 four days too soon. 
Thanks a lot. 
ELISABETH: 
That was strategy, Kimmi. 
America's loss.
JEFF V.: 
We saw it anyway, Bryant. 
GUMBEL: 
 Oh, I'm sorry?
JEFF V.: 
We saw it anyway. 
Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God. 
GUMBEL: 
 TMI, Jeff.
You know, 
 you're the one
who had asked ahead of time, 
I heard, "If 
 somebody has sex
out there, 
are you going to tape it?" 
How did you hear this? 
GUMBEL: 
 I asked around.
Um, no-nobody did.
Nobody even tried.
 How come? 
Well, I mean, I don't... 
You know, everybody says, 
 "Who had sex with whom? 
Where's the romance?" 
But to me, 
 I mean, for the life of me, 
I cannot imagine anybody 
 in that environment 
being romantically attracted 
 to anybody. 
GUMBEL: 
 Why? 
JEFF V.: 
 You're not eating... 
GUMBEL: 
 The rest of us are 
 looking at this and saying,
"This is the Baywatch bunch." 
JEFF V.: 
 Well, you'll be out there with 
 people that are not bathing, 
are not brushing their teeth, 
 are getting on your nerves, 
sleeping in dirt. 
There's nothing sexy 
 about that at all. 
It didn't bother me a bit. 
KIMMI: 
 No Tic-Tacs, 
no square of toilet paper... 
Been wearing 
the same undies for... 
KIMMI: 
You can't touch yourself, 
let alone somebody else. 
GUMBEL: 
 Is that why, 
 Nick, you said
all these women 
 looked so nasty?
ALICIA: 
 Did you say that? 
MARALYN: 
 Bryant? 
GUMBEL: 
 He did. 
After-after 24 hours... 
I mean, we have some cute women 
 in this game and on my tribe. 
And after 24 hours, they're 
 nasty, and I mean... 
( laughter ) 
I mean, so what? 
I was nasty, too. 
I mean, three pairs 
 of underwear. 
Three pairs of underwear. 
You're all nasty. 
 Go ahead, Mad Dog. 
Bryant, as you know, 
 I am a retired cop, 
so from day one, 
 I designated myself 
as the prophylactic police. 
( laughter ) 
There were 12 condoms in that 
first aid kit when I got there, 
and by God, there were 12 
 when I left. 
( laughter ) 
GUMBEL: 
 But I mean,
the rest of us 
 are sitting at home, 
and we're watching 
 these lovely young ladies-- 
which reminds me, 
 which reminds me...
Amber, Elisabeth, 
 having watched 
the first one 
 and seeing 
all the attention 
 that Colleen and Jenna 
got for those bikinis,
what was the deal 
with those bathing suits? 
AMBER: 
 Strategy. No. 
( laughter ) 
JERRI: 
 That's my line.
GUMBEL: 
 Strategy or modesty?
No, I mean, 
I was just thinking, you know...
NICK: 
 We wanted the thong. 
AMBER: 
 The thong, yeah. 
Well, I wanted... if I'm going 
to do challenges 
 in these bathing suits 
and swimming 
 in these bathing suits, 
I didn't want my top 
 falling down anywhere, 
and also, you know, you had 
 to go with the shorts thing, 
and she had the same idea. 
GUMBEL: 
 Elisabeth?
ELISABETH: 
You needed the shorts. 
You feel a little 
 more comfortable, 
and I thought bright, 
in case, um, something drastic 
 would happen, 
someone could definitely 
find me in the pink. 
( laughter ) 
GUMBEL: 
 All right. We'll 
 let it go at that.
Hey, look, as I promised, 
we'll talk, uh, 
 friends and enemies 
when we come back 
 in just a little bit, 
but before we do, Colby,
 a special treat for you.
Some folks in, uh, 
 your hometown of Dallas
are celebrating
with a huge 
 party tonight.
Here's a live look at how 
 some of the Lone Star state
are saluting 
 their star Survivor.
We're back after this.
( cheering ) 
Oh, God, seven weeks 
 in a dumpster! 
If you can survive 
seven weeks in a dumpster, 
you can do seven weeks in the 
 Outback standing on your head. 
( applause ) 
You know, we know 
 the answer to who was 
that mystery woman, but let's 
 take a look at the monitors. 
Who is this 
 mystery woman?
( whooping ) 
GUMBEL: 
 Hello, Mama.
 Hello. 
TINA: 
Bow-wow. 
Back to fighting weight
 now, aren't you? 
Yes, I am, Bryant. 
Hey, look,
um, Keith alluded 
 to it earlier. 
There are 
 some relationships here 
that have been formed 
 that are going to last 
for a long time.
Uh, a lot of you wanted to be a 
part of this reunion, but Debb, 
you had some
 hesitations,
 didn't you? 
You weren't sure
 you wanted to be
a part of this
 reunion. 
How come? 
I... I knew I didn't 
 want to be a part of it. 
How come? 
Well... 
I guess nobody really got 
 a chance to know me, 
and then I... 
 and then I got home... 
and the press 
pretty much tore me apart. 
It hasn't been fun. 
Would you 
 do it again?
No way. 
Bad trade-- three days
 in the Outback 
for your life 
 being... exposed? 
Bad trade, bad trade, but... 
 you can't look back. 
I mean, it's a done deal. 
You just got to move forward. 
It's just, uh... 
I guess the hard part 
 is I'm strong... 
I'm a very strong, 
 independent person, 
care about people a lot, 
and... I seem 
to have, uh... 
lost my belief in myself. 
You know, but I-I will 
 get it back. I will. 
You already got it back. 
Debb, 
we love you. 
( applause ) 
Captain Kel, 
 what about you?
Um, I saw 
 where you said
you will never, 
 accent on the never,
forgive Jerri 
 for what she did. 
Why not?
Isn't life a little
 too short for that?
I have forgiven Jerri. 
I have. 
But I don't like her. 
( laughter ) 
That's a good 
answer. 
She'll never... 
Well, she'll never get 
a Christmas card from me. Never.
Um... 
I guess it's your turn, Jerri. 
Well, I mean, I don't ever 
 expect in my life 
to have everyone like me, but...
There's 
 a good bet.
( laughter ) 
We're going 
 to have breakfast again. 
Yeah, I know. 
I know. 
No, I really don't.
And I, you know... 
The things 
 that happened out there 
are... 
 are so separate
from... 
 our lives now, and... 
and I think for some people, 
 maybe it's easier... 
to tell the difference. 
And... you know, I... 
 I feel... 
I feel bad,
 Kel, I do, 
that... 
that you harbor
resentment and 
 hatred towards me.
But you know, Jerri, 
this is the first time 
you've ever spoken to me. 
This is the first time... 
That's what today 
is for,
for me. 
I hope that 
 that's kind of what 
it's been for everyone, 
the same way. 
I've been talking 
 to a lot of people.
Like I've said, 
 I've forgiven you. 
You're just not going to get 
Christmas cards from me. 
Um, let's move on. 
Alicia, you send a Chris... 
you send a Christmas
 card to Kimmi? 
Come on, now, 
 we had the... 
We had the head bob,
 the head bob, 
and the finger point
 and everything else.
Um, do you send 
 a Christmas card? 
I'm famous for that 
finger wave, man. 
There's a couple of
 people who saw it. 
Just a few. 
We'll refresh 
 everyone's memory.
Roll the tape, Al. 
COLBY: 
 Here we go again. 
That's all 
I was saying. 
It's a good thing just 
 to break it up, especially... 
You are the defensive one 
 about the chickens, not me, 
so do not yell at me about... 
( talking overlaps ) 
( contestants whooping ) 
( applause ) 
I'm tired of your 
 ... chicken. 
GUMBEL: 
 In this corner... 
Well, wait 
 a second now. 
She called you.
Yeah, she did. 
Why didn't you call her back? 
Because, out of 
everything that's happened 
 to me on this... 
in this game, on this show, 
with all of these people, 
that's the one 
 really negative thing. 
And at that time, 
and what I was doing 
 at that point, 
I was not ready 
 to confront that. 
I didn't want to confront 
 the negative thing. 
I was having too much fun 
 with all the positive things, 
and, uh, 
so I didn't call her back. 
And now?
 It's all good. 
( laughter ) 
Kimmi and I-- 
like Kel said-- she's not 
going to get 
 a Christmas card from me. 
We're never going 
to be, like, best buddies. 
I mean, we wouldn't
 have got along 
no matter where we were, 
 but you know what? 
These 16 people 
are so incredibly amazing, 
and for me to not hold
 close to my heart 
everything that I've been 
 through, including-- 
got to love you, Kimmi-- 
 including that 
whole episode with Kimmi-- 
 I mean, I can't 
walk away with this 
 harboring ill feelings 
toward anybody 
 or anything, so...
We like that. 
 Amber, you said
that you were good
 at hiding the fact
that you got 
 annoyed easily.
Why'd you 
 hide it? 
Because... I didn't want to make
 it obvious to anybody, 
'cause then they might hold 
 a grudge against me 
and vote me out earlier, 
 you know? 
Why would 
you want to show somebody 
that you're annoyed with them? 
You want... you want them 
 to think that you like them. 
Jerri would say
that's just 
 being honest. 
JERRI: 
 Yup, and that's, for me, 
that's what 
 I found to be 
the way to keep my sanity 
 in that situation, 
was to express it 
 and get it out. 
And I guess I just... 
 I expected it, as well, 
for other people 
 to do the same to me. 
If somebody 
 was irritated with me, 
I would've been 
 perfectly fine with them 
bringing it up in my face, 
 getting it out on the table... 
KIMMI: 
 Jerri, you saw what happened, 
 didn't you? 
We tried that. 
Rodger went the
 opposite route.
Rodger, I believe 
 I read 
that you said you 
 went in there, uh,
attempting 
 to not be mean,
but be straightforward
 and couldn't 
bring yourself
 to do it. 
Well, I think I was 
 pretty straightforward. 
I went in there 
 with the intentions 
of trying 
to play the game, and, uh, 
that's the reason I've got a lot
of respect for these two people 
that were 
 in the finals here tonight. 
They were able to do something 
that I wasn't able to do, 
and that is 
 actually play the game. 
And, uh, and I don't know that 
 that's really such 
a bad thing in-in 
the, uh, the long run. 
And, uh, 
I was satisfied with the, 
with the place that I finished. 
And, uh, 
when I got off the plane, 
first thing I told my wife, 
 I said, "I didn't do 
anything out there 
 that I was ashamed of," so... 
That's nice
 to hear. 
And Keith, 
 I can't let...
( applause ) 
All right, we'll
 take a break. 
When we come back,
we're going to consider 
 how the Outback 
changed everyone 
 and the life lessons learned, 
but first, we'll take a look 
at what's happening 
 tonight in Miami. 
( cheering ) 
And in college, 
 I even got on a bull or two. 
Come on, Colby.
( shouting ) 
MAN: 
Yeah! 
Whoo! 
MAN: 
Yeah...! 
( applause ) 
Way to go, cowboy. 
COLBY: 
Thanks. 
It wasn't your
 first rodeo, 
 I take it. 
No. 
 No? 
No, sir. 
Uh, look, um, 
 I've been asking
a lot of 
 questions, but,
uh, some of 
 the good folks
who are sitting 
 out here have some.
And so, we'll ask this gentleman
 to, uh, voice 
our first question 
from the audience. 
Yes, sir? 
 This is for Rodger. 
How did you get the nerve 
to jump off that cliff 
into that water? 
DEBB: 
That was a good move. 
 Well, that... 
I definitely was not gonna let 
 my other tribe members down, 
and for me personally, that 
 was probably the hardest thing 
that I've ever had to do 
 in my lifetime. 
I can't swim. 
Come on, Rodger!
COLBY: 
 The other thing was, 
you didn't see, 
 but we actually pushed him. 
RODGER: 
 Yeah. 
 ( laughter ) 
GUMBEL: 
Yes, we have another question 
over here. Yes, ma'am? 
Yeah, my question is 
 for Elisabeth. 
As a fellow Rhode Islander, um, 
there's some pretty 
 scary and, uh, amazing
wildlife out there.
What was your 
 most memorable
or maybe scariest 
 encounter? 
Oh, gosh. Uh, I guess my... 
My most scary encounter 
every day kind of happened 
at night when you'd have 
to use the latrine, and... 
Oh, yeah. 
And I-I'm not gonna play tough. 
I was scared to death, 
 because, you know what it is? 
It's your imagination 
out there that gets you, 
because you know they are. 
You see them during the day-- 
 you see a snake, 
you see a croc, you see 
everything out there, and, 
uh, when it's your time 
to be alone with the dark, 
that's when I got scared. 
Yeah. 
'Cause you... every noise, 
you're, like... you just 
think the worst, so, I guess 
 that would be it 
in my most honest moment. 
JEFF V.: 
 Bryant, I would
 escort her 
to the bathroom
 every night, 
and I would, 
 like... Alicia 
 would go with us. 
ALICIA: 
Yup, buddy system, 
absolutely. 
And I'd-I'd pinch 'em 
on the leg 
 at the bottom,
and I'd scare them 
 intentionally. 
ALICIA: 
 He was the worst. 
 He was. 
( laughter ) 
ALICIA: 
The worst. 
Did you hear that? 
 GUMBEL: 
 Yeah, Kel? 
And Bryant, 
my most scariest encounter 
has got to be Jerri. 
( laughter, groaning, 
 light applause ) 
It's got to be, got to be... 
GUMBEL: 
 You know, you 
 know, I don't...
I'm not... I'm not
 going to belabor 
the hygiene thing, 
 but can I get a count? 
How many toothbrushes 
 were out there? 
ALL: 
 One. 
One after 
 two weeks. 
Well, after-after 
 they won it, yeah. 
On day-day 14. 
 Zero for us 
 at Ogakor. 
It had no bristles
 after two days. 
Zero. 
 Oh, really?
No bristles. 
After Kucha got done with it. 
We snacked on the bristles. 
 So what did we do?
Brush our teeth
 with sand, or 
just don't-don't...? 
( all talking at once ) 
ELISABETH: 
You kind of get 
your shirt... 
And you scrub 
 your teeth. 
Yeah, you wipe off the plaque. 
JERRI: 
The plaque wipe, 
the daily plaque wipe. 
GUMBEL: 
 Nice, nice.
The nice pine trees,
 'cause we didn't... 
NICK: 
This is why 
people were nasty. 
... have, uh, any good wood, 
so we'd cut pine needles. 
Although, 
 wait a minute.
 Nick, Nick... 
This was why there was no... 
( all talking at once ) 
ALICIA: 
 Can we get back 
to the nasty thing for a second?
Nick wants to say Elisabeth 
 and I were so nasty, 
but Nick kissed me 
 right on the lips. 
ELISABETH: 
Yes, he did. 
Hello. Did you not? 
It's a long story 
 to that, but yes. 
( laughter ) 
ALICIA: 
 Right on the lips.
Can you say it in 
 less than 30 seconds? 
Well, right-right 
 after the first time 
we brushed our teeth, 
 Alicia was... 
KIMMI: 
 Yeah, that's true.
...like, "I'm so clean, 
I'm so fresh. 
Who wants to kiss me?" 
 I said... And laid one on her. 
She was, like... 
 ( laughter ) 
ELISABETH: 
He did! 
 Hello!
Jerri, why didn't 
 you try that? 
BOTH: 
 They/we didn't have 
 a toothbrush. 
Huh?
 Yeah, they didn't 
 have a toothbrush. 
We were doing the plaque rub. 
I would have 
 kissed him anyway.
GUMBEL: 
 I know. She
 kissed you.
JERRI: 
 Not for lack
 of trying. 
GUMBEL: 
 Well, we thought
something was 
 wrong with you.
You said there was no 
 distractions out there.
How could you say there
 was no distractions 
with these ladies 
 sitting here? 
Oh, it was... 
No, it-it was distracting. 
GUMBEL: 
 Oh, okay. 
COLBY: 
Early on more so than 
later in the game. 
GUMBEL:
 Oh! 
No, I mean, just because 
I finally just determined 
it was time to get focused. 
GUMBEL: 
 Got you.
I'm not gonna pursue it. 
COLBY: 
Hey! 
( chuckling ):
 Yes, ma'am? 
WOMAN: 
First of all, 
on behalf of Reebok, 
congratulations, Tina. 
My question is for Michael. 
Michael, when you hunted 
and killed the boar, 
why did you put the blood 
around your eyes? 
( laughter ) 
Yeah, Michael, why?
 KIMMI: 
 Psycho! 
ALICIA: 
 We're all wondering that. 
Tell us all. We want 
 to know why you did that. 
MICHAEL: 
 You know, it is on 
 the actual tape, 
but when I said it, 
 everyone forget about it 
once I did that, 
 but I didn't want 
to tell the other tribe 
 that we... 
that even catching a boar 
 was possible. 
They kept saying, "We've got 
 to tell the other tribe. 
We got to get the advantage." 
And I kept saying no, 
but I got outvoted six to one. 
So, I said fine, 
 if we're gonna tell them, 
this is how we should go 
 to the next challenge. 
And I put the blood on my face 
 as a kind of a joke, saying 
instead of wearing the war paint
 that we sometimes wore, 
we would go 
 to the next challenge 
wearing the pig's blood, 
and that would be the way 
 we'd tell them. 
KIMMI: 
Yeah, I was gonna do that! 
It was just 
 meant to 
 be a joke, 
for Kimmi, 
 for Kimmi. 
He's a little 
 nutty, this guy.
GUMBEL: 
 Yeah. Let 
 me, um... 
Debb has already said 
she wouldn't do it again. 
Mitchell, what about you? 
I mean, weren't 
 you overmatched?
Is that fair
 to do say? 
I wouldn't do it... 
I can put myself back 
 in those shoes, 
and I can realize 
 how much I suffered. 
I could never 
 go through it again. 
Honestly, for me, um, 
every day I kept thinking, 
"When-When am I going 
to be leaving?" You know? 
And-And as I made 
 that final walk 
to Tribal Council, 
 I had no idea I was leaving, 
and it was a huge shock to me, 
but a welcome one at that point.
GUMBEL:
 Yeah. 
Yeah, and-and I'd also like 
 to say 
that afterwards, I was able 
to travel with Debb, 
 and, um, I really got 
to know the Debb 
 that nobody else did, 
and found that she's a wonderful
 and amazing woman, definitely. 
( applause ) 
 Thank you. 
You are, 
 you are...
( applause ) 
GUMBEL: 
 As Mad Dog has
so often, uh, reminded us, 
 this was a G-A-M-E, after all. 
( laughter ) 
Um,
but as some of you have noted, 
it is pretty life-changing, too.
Um, Keith, you... 
MARALYN: 
 Bryant? 
Go ahead. 
I've already gone 
 through the change of life. 
( laughter and applause ) 
GUMBEL: 
 Forgive us if we don't 
 pursue that, all right?
No. 
 Keith, you
 talked 
about it being 
 a cleansing experience. 
Cleansed of 
 what? How so? 
Well, first of all, 
 I have to say 
that Jerri and I are 
 in counseling. 
( laughter ) 
We're working out 
those issues. 
You know, I am now 41 years old.
And I'm divorced, 
 have two wonderful children. 
You know, I've had failures, 
and I've had, you know, 
 successes and stuff. 
And the last few days 
for me really enabled 
 me to just reflect. 
I mean, how many times 
 in your life 
do you really 
have an opportunity to sit 
and do nothing but think, 
 with no sounds, 
no one to talk to you 
 or nothing? 
And those last few days, 
 it was very... 
A lot of solitude, 
 especially me. 
I went up the top 
 of this big hill, 
and I just hung out up there 
 and watched the eagles fly. 
Yeah. 
 It was a big deal for me. 
It gave me an opportunity 
 to see... 
say I'm sorry 
 for a lot of things 
to myself and say 
 let's do some things better. 
So, for me, the game kind of 
 stopped at that point. 
I was on to a whole new game, 
all about life. 
( applause ) 
We're gonna take
a break right here 
 and come back 
and do some more business. 
We'll also let in you 
 on the secret 
of the next Survivor 
 when the reunion continues. 
But also a quick hand 
 for our live band over here, 
with David Hudson 
 on the didgeridoo.
( band playing, women singing ) 
Shh! Shh! Shh! 
I think I hear something. 
I got him. I got him. 
( thud ) 
 Whoo! I got him, I got him! 
I told you. 
( Gumbel laughs ) 
( applause ) 
That 'roo is up there. 
That kangaroo is up there 
 in the audience. 
Kangaroo 
 is up there.
That kangaroo 
 is in the 
 audience? 
That kangaroo is sitting 
right there in the blue shirt. 
Stand up, Peter. 
Good jumping, babe, 
 good hopping. 
( laughter and applause ) 
My kangaroo! 
Hey, look, the mud is, uh, 
barely dry 
 on the shoes
of these castaways. 
In fact, I'm not sure 
 the sweat is. 
But, um, plans are 
 already underway 
for the next Survivor challenge 
 coming this fall. 
And if you thought snakes 
 and crocs were intimidating, 
wait till you see what's waiting
for the next 16 survivors, 
deep in the heart of Africa. 
Jeff Probst has a preview. 
( Survivor theme plays ) 
JEFF: 
 It is the cradle 
 of civilization, 
the birthplace of humanity. 
This is Africa. 
And soon, 16 strangers 
 will embark 
on the greatest adventure 
 of their lives. 
They will voluntarily 
 be stranded 
in this land 
 of stunning beauty, 
incredible vistas 
 and breathtaking scenery. 
But don't be fooled. 
It is also a land 
 of inherent dangers 
filled with exotic 
 and deadly animals. 
But it is not impossible 
 to thrive out here. 
The Masai have survived 
 for centuries 
by simply learning to adapt 
to their environment. 
By becoming one with the land, 
 they have learned to live 
in one of the most 
 hostile settings on Earth. 
How will these 16 
 new survivors fare 
in this dangerous wilderness, 
and more importantly, 
how will they survive 
 each other? 
( growls ) 
The continent may have changed,
but the game is still 
 the same-- 
outwit, outplay, outlast 
until only one remains 
and emerges 
 as the sole survivor. 
( cheering and applause ) 
Oh, yeah! 
ALICIA: 
 That's gonna 
 be good. 
I want to go! 
ALICIA: 
 I know. 
That African adventure 
 begins this fall. 
And your advice 
to those people going to Africa,
Colby, would be...?
Expect the 
 absolute worst. 
Yup. 
 ( laughter ) 
Really? 
 Honestly, yeah. 
You're gonna be
 really shocked 
 if you don't. 
NICK: 
 It's not...
Good advice. 
That's good advice. 
NICK: 
 It's not fun. 
Let me ask 
 you a question.
We've now gone about, oh, 
53 minutes 
 into this program, 
and we haven't made any 
 comparisons between your group 
and the prior group,
 intentionally. 
Okay. 
But one thing 
 did strike me.
The first group,
um, had a series
 of philosophical
discussions about religion, 
about children out of wedlock, 
about sexual orientation, 
about family, 
 a variety 
 of subjects. 
Your group
 never did.
AMBER & JERRI: 
 Yeah, we did. 
GUMBEL: 
 At least we 
 never saw it. 
ELISABETH: 
We did. 
ALL: 
 You didn't see it. 
 Oh. 
MICHAEL: 
 There was 
 just too much 
other stuff 
 going around. 
JERRI: 
 One of the 
 many moments
that didn't 
 make the show.
ELISABETH: 
No, I can honestly say, as well,
we had discussions, 
but they weren't for the sake 
of having them, either. 
Like, when we had them, 
they just... they just happened.
And if they were caught, 
 they were caught, 
and if they weren't, 
 they weren't, but... 
Spirited 
 discussions?
 Yes. 
Oh.
Kucha had a two-hour 
spirited discussion 
on farting 
my first night. 
( laughter ) 
Yes. 
ELISABETH:
 We did! 
GUMBEL: 
 I-I don't think 
 we can say that.
I think we have to say 
 "bilabial fricative..." 
( laughter ) 
 on television.
JERRI: 
 Ew! That sounds 
 disgusting. 
Thank you.
 ALICIA: 
 Yeah, that sounds worse.
MICHAEL: 
Hey, Bryant, you focused 
a lot on a lot 
 of the negative 
and fighting 
 relationships 
that went on, but some 
 of the relationships 
that were formed as a result 
 of the show... 
I mean, I never knew Keith Famie
 from Detroit, 
and I never even met 
 him out in the Outback,
and I never met
 Tina out there,
and those are two 
 of the best friends
that I have from this show. 
It's just the bond
 that we created 
as a part of this show... 
I mean, there was a couple 
 of isolated fights 
that went on, 
 but I mean, everybody... 
GUMBEL: 
 And we know 
 Rodger and Elisabeth
formed a bond.
 Everybody here. 
 Look at these two... 
Jeff and Alicia... 
Jeff and I are
 inseparable. 
...are virtually
 inseparable. 
We're inseparable. 
Kel and Jerri,
 um, and.. 
( laughter ) 
Wait... 
GUMBEL: 
 And Tina, 
you were gonna tell me... 
You told me 
 during the commercial 
you had a quick story 
to tell about Mr. 
 Varner back here? 
Yes, I do. I started out 
really thinking he was a player.
You know, he was this sweet guy 
who brought this coloring book 
 to give to charity, 
and he was this really 
 compassionate guy. 
I later found out, 
the night that we voted him off 
 at Tribal Council, 
he suspected he was going to go.
Well, we had caught 13 fish 
that day. 
We were all gonna get a fish 
 of our very own. 
ALICIA: 
 That's... What?!
We had the fish, 
 we did not get a chance 
to cook them, 
so we put them on a 
 stringer in the water.
We came back that night 
 starving, gonna eat our fish. 
They were gone, and we said, 
"The crocs or the alligators 
 have eaten our fish." 
You! 
 Jeff! 
( all talking at once ) 
Oh, my God! 
( laughter and applause ) 
AMBER: 
Did you know that? 
ELISABETH: 
 Jeff! 
AMBER: 
 Eww! 
TINA: 
 Evil! 
( chattering ) 
Evil! You are evil! 
RODGER: 
You dog, you. 
Hey, look, as we head 
 to commercial break, 
what did you do 
 on your vacation? 
Show us,
 Mad Dog.
Show us what
 you learned.
Hit it. 
Break it on
 down, mama.
Whoo! 
( blowing didgeridoo ) 
Yeah! 
( cheering and applause ) 
All right.
( instrument plays funny sound )
All right! 
 Yeah, Mad Dog!
( cheering and applause ) 
GUMBEL: 
 We're gonna take 
 a break right here.
But as-as we head to commercial,
Elisabeth, here's something 
 you'll want to see. 
Take a look 
 at what's happening tonight 
in your hometown of Boston, 
 where a big Survivor party 
is underway celebrating
 the achievement 
of one of Boston's own. 
( cheering and applause ) 
Basically, 
for quite some time now, 
all I can think about 
in the car is being a survivor, 
and there are a couple of things
that I think 
decisions can be made on. 
( thudding ) 
Not... potholes. 
( laughing ) 
( laughter and applause ) 
Oh, no. 
We've only got
about 30 seconds left. 
Um, Tina, 
 you had the first word, 
you get 
 the last one. 
Um, just answer
 us one thing. 
We saw the 
 sweet motherly 
 Tina out there,
and we saw the one 
 who was described as--
by someone in this crowd-- 
 as "ruthless." 
Which is the
 real Tina? 
In the middle. 
A little of both. 
Got to have a good balance 
 in life. 
GUMBEL: 
 And that's what got
 you the million? 
Uh... 
Lot of luck, 
lot of luck got a million. 
GUMBEL: 
 Congratulations.
Thank you so much. 
( cheering and applause ) 
Tonight was the first time 
 in a long time 
that these 16 survivors 
have all been together, 
but it won't be the last. 
They'll be joining me tomorrow 
on The Early Show where, 
 among other things, 
we'll present Tina 
 with her million-dollar check 
for becoming 
 the one survivor 
who managed to 
 outwit, outplay
and outlast 
 in the Outback.
Exactly why the actions 
 of all these people 
have captivated so many 
remains a point of debate, 
a mystery perhaps better left 
 to psychologists. 
We only know they've
 played a game 
amid the worst 
 of elements with 
 millions watching 
and millions judging
 their character. 
That they've emerged
 with as much dignity
as they have is
 no small feat. 
On behalf of these 16 
 now familiar people, 
thank you very much for being 
 a part of this reunion. 
In every way, 
 the tribe has spoken. 
I'm Bryant Gumbel. 
Good night. 
( cheering and applause )
