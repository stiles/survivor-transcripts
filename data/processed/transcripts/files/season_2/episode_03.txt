         JEFF: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Michael provided fish 
and took his leadership role 
to new heights. 
MICHAEL: 
 Dear God, thanks 
for making me the leader 
of the troops. 
KIMMI: 
 Mike thanks God for making him 
 the leader of the tribe. 
I don't know 
 when he was anointed, 
but apparently 
 my back was turned. 
JEFF: 
 At Ogakor, Kel, 
the loner, was the one 
 serious about fishing. 








We do need to get some fish. 
KEITH: 
 Our plan for getting 
 food is, uh... 
we don't really have 
 a good plan, actually. 
JEFF: 
 And Jerry muscled in 
 on Chef Keith's domain. 
JERRI: 
 There's a bunch more things 
 we can have than rice 
and I'm ready to start 
 making some of them. 
KEITH: 
 She if she wants to cook some 
 tortillas for breakfast, 
I think that's fantastic. 
No worries, mate. 
JEFF: 
 Rodger struggled 
with the reward challenge. 
RODGER: 
 Water is not my finest point. 
Come on, Rodger!
JEFF: 
 At the immunity challenge, 
 Kimmi, the vegetarian, 








secured a victory for Kucha by 
 swallowing a mangrove worm... 
sending Ogakor to Tribal 
 Counsel were Kel was voted out.
Kel, the tribe 
has spoken. 
14 people are left. 
Tonight, one more will go. 
MICHAEL: 
 Ultimately, this game 
 is about the million dollars, 
but you need to take 
small steps along the way 
 to get there. 
And some of the small steps 
 along the way to get there 
are eating, because none of us 
are going to win the million 
 dollars if we don't have 
protein in our bodies and we 
 can win the challenges. 
You guys, there's more 
food to be had 
 Oh, yeah. 
that we haven't explored yet. 
We still don't 
have food 
as a priority in this camp. 
What's your chances
 of catching a pig? 
JEFF V.: 
Pig hunting, since 
we haven't seen, like, 
an abundance of them, you 
know, it's like there's 
 Or any. 
one out there, you
 know what I mean? 
We just walk around and hope 
 that during day 
we run into this big pig 
 the size of a table. 
Mike wants to go out 
 four hours a day 
and look for food 
 because Mike is hungry. 
Nobody else is up for that. 
I'm going to find 
something that's alive 
that we are going to kill. 
I am very, very 
 determined to get a pig. 
They got to drink sometime 
and there's got to be 
 tracks somewhere 
and I'm going to ambush one. 
Hey, Jeff, where's 
 that spear you made?
I didn't finish it. 
But if
 you're going
to use it for a spear, then... 
MICHAEL: 
 Once I see a pig, it's going 
 to be a, you know, 
an incredible act of exertion 
 to try and get. 
But I'm going to build a spear 
with the knife on the end, 
and then I'm going 
 to run one down, 
and I'm going to get 
 as close as I can 
and I'm just going 
 to kind of, you know, 
figure it out from there. 
This isn't about 
running out looking for 
 a hardcore hunter. 
This is about ... doing 
 something that's realistic. 
That is not realistic. 
Mike, I'm a little worried 
you're going to lose that knife.
And I'm glad you brought 
 that to my attention, 
and I will absolutely, 
positively not lose this knife. 
I hope he loses 
our knife, 
just to give a valuable reason 
to go off on the bastard. 
ELISABETH: 
 We have one knife, 
and that one knife, it might 
 as well be food, but he 
wants to go and spear a pig. 
Really? Have we seen a pig? 
We haven't seen a pig. 
 I haven't seen a pig. 
Believe me, if I see a pig, 
 I'll want to eat it, 
but to just 
 go spear just because 
you want to come back 
 with one on your stick 
and be, like "Rah, rah"? 
I don't know. 
This is a pig killer. 
JEFF V.: 
 The spear. The spear. 
The stupid spear. 
"I'm going to go catch pigs." 
And he takes our knife 
 and our rope. 
That's classic Mike. 
 He's an idiot. 
I want to see your pig. 
Go get me a pig. 
( chuckling ) 
TINA: 
 To be honest, I didn't expect 
this adventure 
 to be this hard. 
I find myself 
 just craving food. 
Doritos-- I want 
 a bag of Doritos 
more than anything in the world.
COLBY: 
 We haven't had any meat 
 in a week now, 
and the lack of protein 
hasn't taken its toll yet, 
 but it's going to. 
MARALYN: 
 I think I'm going to go 
 check for messages. 
There it is. 
Oh... 
Great aboriginal fathers, 
 be kind to us. 
I haven't opened it yet. 
"It's time to rise to the top 
"or make a big flop. 
"On your shoulders 
"will rest the tribe's fate. 
"For the food 
you've been wishing, 
"you'll need gear 
to go fishing, 
so try not to get 
 crushed by the weight." 
Sure as hell could use
 some fishing line.
Oh, my God. 
I think the main thing 
that's been keeping us 
 from getting fish 
is our fishing line, 
so this is a huge 
reward today. 
AMBER: 
 I'm worried about running out 
of food and 
 running out of rice. 
And we've been trying 
 to eat it sparingly, but... 
You got to eat. 
It's going to run out 
 sooner or later.
I would love to catch a fish 
 out there or something. 
KEITH: 
 It's going to be physical, 
 no matter how you look at it, 
but what we're trying to decide
is whether it's a group effort 
or if it ends up 
 falling on one person, 
and if we have 
 to choose one person, well, 
it makes no sense 
not to choose, uh, Colby. 
He's the strongest, my God. 
You're
 the strongest.
Yeah, I saw you throw 
that one up real quick. 
You got 20 years
 on me, trust me.
You bastard. 
MARALYN: 
 Cowboy can handle 
any challenge. 
TINA: 
 He would die before
 he would fail us. 
COLBY: 
 I would like to think 
that, win or lose on this deal, 
that my stock wouldn't 
 fluctuate at all, 
and people can say, "Colby, 
 don't worry about it. 
"We don't want to put any 
 pressure on you. 
If you don't pull through, 
 it's no big deal." 
But internally, I don't 
 think that's the case. 
JEFF: 
 Come on in, guys. 
Today we got a great challenge. 
Before we get to it, though, 
 I want to show you the reward. 
It's an outback fishing package,
complete with line, 
 hooks, lures and a net. 
You got your nylon.
 That's awesome. 
Now that we know what we're 
playing for, 
 here's the challenge. 
It tests your strength, 
 balance and endurance. 
The object is for both tribes 
to get all these 
 buckets of water 
loaded onto the shoulders 
of the other tribe's 
 strongest member. 
The one who holds the buckets 
 the longest 
without falling 
 or quitting wins. 
Each tribe is going to select 
one person 
 to be the water bearer. 
It should be 
 your strongest person. 
You're also going to have 
 a person who is your loader. 
This person's going to be 
 loading the buckets of water 
onto the shoulders 
 of your water bearer. 
So when you get out there, 
Ogakor will take 
 the water from Kucha 
and vice versa, and you will 
load it onto your water bearer. 
The rest of the people are going
 to transport the water 
out there, and you're going 
to do so with one of the beams 
 across your shoulders, 
a bucket full of water on either
 side, and you'll make your way 
across the balancing beams. 
If you fall, 
 you got to start over. 
You want as much water 
in your buckets as you can 
handle because your water 
is going on the opposing tribe's
 water bearer. 
Ogakor, you've chosen Colby 
 to be your water bearer. 
Kucha, you've chosen Michael. 
Survivors ready? Go! 
Oga! Oga! Oga! 
Go, Kucha!
RODGER: 
Hang on, Liz. 
Get your balance. 
Good job, Amber. 
That a girl. 
No worries. 
RODGER: 
Take your time. 
Do your thing. 
( cheering ) 
Good job, Amber. 
Good job. 
All right, Livvy. 
Elisabeth. 
 Yeah, girl.
No. No. No! 
 ( water splashing ) 
All right, 
Kimmi. 
( shrieking ) 
Good job. 
Good job. 
( grunts ) 
Damn it! 
RODGER: 
All right, Elisabeth. 
Way to go. 
Keep it going, Kucha! 
That a way, 
Maralyn. Good job. 
That a way, Mad Dog. 
( indistinct talking ) 
( cheering ) 
Come on,
 Jeffrey.
You got it, buddy. 
JEFF: 
 You guys run out of buckets, 
 it's endurance. 
We'll take good care 
 of you tonight, cowboy. 
Don't even think 
about that one. 
This sucks. This sucks. 
JEFF: 
 Colby and Michael, 
you guys now have 
 all the buckets. 
That means you're each holding 
 more than 400 pounds of water. 
Whoever holds on 
 the longest wins. 
Come on, Mike! 
( screaming ) 
( indistinct shouting ) 
ELISABETH: 
 Bring it on!
You can take
 ten more, Mike.
You're the man! Whoo-hoo! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
We believe
 in you, Mike! 
He's shaking, Mike. 
You're not, baby. 
( indistinct shouting ) 
JEFF: 
 Hold on. No decision. 
Great job, Mike.
Great job! 
66 buckets, both these guys 
 took on their shoulders. 
Michael's pole broke 
 before anybody quit, 
that means there's no winner. 
So now you guys 
are going to do a runoff. 
We're going to do 
a five-minute timed race. 
The tribe that gets 
 the most buckets 
on the other tribe's water 
 bearer's shoulders 
wins this. 
Survivors, ready? 
Go! 
Nicely done. 
That a girl. 
JEFF: 
 You got four minutes. 
Eight buckets Ogakor, 
 six buckets Kucha. 
We're all even at ten. 
Two minutes. 
Kucha, 14. Ogakor, 12. 
20 seconds. 
 Ogakor up by two. 
Hang tough.
 Hang tough!
Make it there, 
Kimmi. 
JEFF: 
 Five, four, three, two, 
one-- Ogakor! 
( cheering ) 
Let's get out of here. 
I don't want to hear 
 them scream anymore. 
( women laughing ) 
TINA: 
 I can't wait to get the food 
you don't have to work your 
 butt off so to hard to get. 
I mean, we have done fantastic 
on a small amount of food. 
You get food in us, 
and we're going 
to be unstoppable. 
There you go. 
Winning this competition means 
 a lot more to us 
than just bringing home a bag 
 of fishing supplies. 
These are the days 
 when it comes down to morale, 
and the mental edge 
 going into this. 
And we're three and one now. 
The stats are pretty good 
 for us. 
I certainly don't think 
this answers everything. 
We still got to catch the fish. 
The fish aren't going 
 to jump into our camp. 
MITCHELL: 
 At the time, I didn't think 
that reward challenge 
 was very important 
because something told me 
there really wasn't a lot 
 of fish out here. 
And it sucks that they didn't 
 give us the fish. 
They give us the means 
to catch the fish. 
AMBER: 
You had one. 
I saw it. 
JERRI: 
Yes, I did. Whoa! 
That is awesome. 
I don't know 
what part we can touch 
that he won't slice us. 
Okay. All right.
There you go. 
AMBER: 
I'm proud of you. 
I got it off the hook. 
I couldn't stop smiling. 
Keith said there were no fish. 
He said, "There's no fish 
 out there." 
Him and Kel both were saying 
 that for days and days. 
Holy... 
They were practically jumping in
 the boats. 
Chef Keith, you're 
 going to be proud of us. 
Here we go now. 
We need the fish gutted 
 and scaled. 
When they came back with fish, 
they immediately said, 
 "Oh, where's the chef?" 
The "chef" word's 
 never been used before. 
Check that out. 
KEITH: 
 As a chef, my strategy 
 was to come in here 
and create just spectacular 
 dinners and meals, 
and until now, 
we've had zero luck at doing 
 anything from the rivers 
or from the flora, 
 for that matter. 
AMBER: 
Today is day seven, and we have 
 caught our first fish 
so actually, that's not too bad.
It did take us a week, but hey, 
 it's better than two weeks. 
KEITH: 
 How did I know that 
once the fish is caught, 
I'd be the guy filleting these? 
AMBER: 
 You're doing that really well. 
Especially with a dull knife. 
 He's doing exceptionally well. 
MITCHELL: 
 Yeah, really. 
JERRI: 
 I think right now, 
everybody's pretty happy 
that Keith is there 
 to cook the fish 
that we've been catching. 
I know sometimes he says things
 to other people 
that kind of rub them 
 the wrong way, 
but I'm probably the one 
who gets irritated with him 
 the most. 
I'm aware of that. 
KEITH: 
 Here we go. 
We'll just bread those 
 in the flour, 
crush up the salt 
 a little bit. 
Put the salt on it 
and bread it with the flour. 
We just don't have oil, 
 but it'll be okay. 
I say we don't waste
 the flour. 
COLBY: 
 The most tension in 
 the tribe seems 
to be between Jerri and Keith. 
With the cooking and everyone 
 responding well to her cooking,
( whistles ) that put them on 
 a level playing field there, 
and so there's not really 
 a power struggle yet, 
but it could definitely come 
 to that point. 
MARALYN: 
Keith, we're all hovering 
 over you 
like a bunch of greedy sharks. 
KEITH: 
 Like I'm doing 
 a cooking class.
COLBY: 
 Even when Keith was 
over filleting the fish, 
I noticed there were 
 several eyes paying attention, 
and what that tells me 
 is that his stock 
didn't go up at all. 
 You know, 
all he did was basically play 
the role of instructor 
 on how to cook fish. 
MITCHELL: 
Ooh, it looks a little bit 
 like a fish fry. 
COLBY: 
 Oh, it smells so good. 
Yes, it does, indeedy. 
I can't wait to try it. 
KEITH: 
 Maralyn. 
Oh, wow! 
Thank you. 
Oh. 
Oh, yes. 
That's good. 
 You like that? 
TINA: 
 Yeah. The fish that Keith made 
 was excellent. 
That was like a blessing 
 'cause we were starving. 
We were so hungry. 
Mm. 
So his first meal 
 wasn't that great, 
but his first meal 
of fish was fantastic. 
Oh, my God! It is so good! 
KEITH: 
 Tonight's dinner 
 was definitely a success. 
Is it good? 
Oh, my God. 
KEITH: 
 Since cooking the fish, 
I think my stock's gone up 
 a good amount. 
I think the team 
 has been pretty 
excited about what I've been 
 able to do for them. 
It is so good. 
I've never had 
 such a great meal. 
But you know what? 
Jerri could do that, I could 
even do that. 
So having a chef out here 
isn't as crucial 
 as he may think, 
because we don't have 
 a lot to work with. 
KIMMI: 
 I'm usually on top 
 of the water. 
I filled up eight jugs 
 this morning, 
and now I refilled 
 up... this is the second one, 
so now I've done 
ten jugs of water. 
Are you all right, 
Kimmi? 
Yeah. 
It's a lot of work 
because you've got to boil this
 crocodile creek water 
before you can drink it. 
You got to go down 
 and fill the big jug 
and then go up, 
boil the water, 
 let the water cool, 
put it in the big container. 
I mean, it doesn't seem like 
you're contributing a lot 
because it's gone, as soon 
as it's there, it's gone. 
I got to go tend to the water. 
RODGER: 
 I have noticed 
 the amount of work 
that Kimmi has been doing. 
And it seems 
 to be a whole lot more 
than really just about 
 anybody else. 
She's really worried that she's
 going to be the next one 
to go. 
KIMMI: 
 I sometimes feel vulnerable 
 because I don't have 
a tight, tight bond 
 with somebody 
that could be pulling 
 for me in my corner. 
Yeah, that might be a bad thing 
because I might be just, like, 
"Oh, easy target, 
 pick Kimmi off." 
All right. 
This means that I boiled 
 everything in this jug. 
MICHAEL: 
Really? 
Every job and task 
that Kimmi takes on in this camp
can be taken over 
 by somebody else, for sure. 
Kentucky? 
RODGER: 
Yes, ma'am, what? 
Do you have lotion? 
 You all good? 
Yeah, I just put some 
 on a little while ago, thanks. 
JEFF V.: 
 Well, there's sort 
 of a little battle between 
Kentucky Joe and Kimmi. 
Some of the people in the tribe
 feel that 
we will be stronger 
 without Kentucky Joe. 
I'm going to try to 
 catch some fish this morning. 
Make a new line. 
ELISABETH: 
 I know in the beginning 
there was talk 
 of voting Rodger off 
and I tried really hard 
 to rally people not to do it 
just 'cause I feel 
 strongly for him. 
ALICIA: 
 Kentucky Joe, although 
 he's not a strong member 
of this tribe as far 
 as challenges are concerned, 
he knows 
 what he's doing outside. 
Back to the drawing board. 
Maybe we'll catch one this time.
I always heard that the best 
 place to catch them 
is where a stream runs 
 into a river. 
I was out here looking 
 for sinkers 
to make 
 a new fishing pole with, 
and I found a little 
 rock out here about that tall 
shaped like a heart. 
He said, "Here you go. 
 What's that look like? 
And I said, "A heart." 
He said, "You take that 
 with you, 
give it to your boyfriend 
 when you get back." 
And he said, 
 "You just know I care." 
And it just... 
 it just touched me. 
Thanks a lot. 
You're welcome. 
Me and her, it just seemed like 
we hit it off right off the bat.
You're so good. 
Well, thank you.
You're a sweet 
 little gal, too,
I tell you what.
Your parents got 
 a lot to be proud 
 of with you. 
ALICIA: 
 Elisabeth said she 
won't vote off Kentucky Joe, 
and-and she protects him. 
ELISABETH: 
 It matters so much 
 to me that he's around, 
so I'm not writing 
 his name down. Uh-uh. 
I will not spell 
 that man's name. 
MARALYN: 
 ? When I'm on the 
 street where you live ? 
? I have often walked down 
 this street before. ? 
Hey, you, girlie-girl. 
Hello. 
I just followed 
your voice. 
Was it that loud? 
TINA: 
 Maralyn, she's kind of 
 like our little song bird 
and our little cheerleader 
 in our camp, 
so Maralyn and I have bonded 
 more so 
than I have with 
 any of the other people. 
It might be our ages, 
it might be that we just 
kind of took up for one another.
( laughs ) 
...Now seriously...
 Mad Dog? 
Nothing hurts Mad Dog. 
MARALYN: 
 Tina is a fabulous woman. 
She is a star. 
I trust Tina the most. 
Um, I do not trust Jerri. 
COLBY: 
 You like crunchy 
 peanut butter or creamy? 
Crunchy. 
Got to have crunchy.
Yeah. 
Black coffee 
or cream and sugar? 
Cream and sugar.
AMBER: 
 There could be something going 
 on between Jerri and Colby. 
I mean, 
 from the very first day, 
she told me how cute 
 she thought he was. 
And at first she didn't think 
 that he liked her. 
And I was, like, "Jerri, 
it's only the second day." 
JERRI: 
 I'd really like it if 
 Colby and I got together. 
He's exactly my type, plus, 
 he's a cowboy 
and I'm such a sucker 
 for cowboys. 
Cake or ice cream? 
Oh, cake. 
Oh! I dig ice cream. 
( chuckles )
Oh, Jerri... Jerri and I 
 are getting along great. 
Every day we have more fun 
 flirting with each other 
and seeing how far 
 we can kind of push it. 
Chocolate chip cookie 
or oatmeal raisin? 
Chocolate chip.
That wasn't really 
a fair competition. 
( laughs )
Oatmeal raisin never stood 
a chance in that battle. 
KEITH: 
 Oh, I think 
Jerri is legitimately attracted
 to Colby, 
but I'm sure that strategic play
 comes... is involved, 
there's no question. 
COLBY: 
I always feel guilty when 
somebody's giving me a massage. 
JERRI: 
 It's all right, though.
I really, I don't mind,
especially after today,
what you did to your back. 
KEITH: 
 I think Jerri's approach 
 is just a lot of... 
she wants to really 
 feel important. 
She's already got Colby 
 on her side, 
but she gets on his side 
rubbing his back and, you know,
nuzzling at night, 
 you know, that whole thing, 
sharing the blanket, 
 all that kind of stuff. 
So it's natural for Colby 
 just to gravitate 
and a little smoke screen 
 goes up 
and so he doesn't 
 necessarily see certain things.
Or maybe he does 
 and I'm just not aware of it. 
COLBY: 
 At this point, I'm not sure 
 if Jerri has ulterior motives. 
Jerri is very capable 
 of deceiving me 
or anyone else in the tribe. 
And maybe she's not, 
 maybe I'm wrong. 
But, uh, I still can't 
 let my guard down. 
JERRI: 
 You're pretty relaxed.
If it came down to me 
 having to vote for Colby... 
I would. 
ALICIA: 
This is spear grass. 
See how tall that is? 
 Yeah, that's definitely
 spear grass. 
That is spear grass. 
JEFF V.: 
 Alicia and I, 
we went for that foraging walk 
together intentionally. 
I've thought a lot 
 about the voting, 
and I wanted to be able 
 to get away with her 
and just have her think 
 about the future 
and who would be the most 
valuable to have with us 
 in a final four, 
that we could beat. 
JEFF V.: 
You and I are committed 
to each other 
for that final four. 
 Right. 
Because the truth 
of the matter is, I feel like 
you're the only one 
 I really trust, at this point. 
Wow! 
Look at the size of that one. 
That is a 
 major spider. 
ALICIA: 
 Jeff and I are constantly 
scheming and planning 
about how this thing should go. 
Now, Elisabeth can't be 
 in the final four. 
She can't be 'cause 
 she'll make it to the end.
Yeah. And I don't think 
 Nick can be either. 
We talked about, you know, who 
 we're going to vote for now, 
who we're going to vote 
 for next time, 
who we trust, 
 who we don't trust. 
ALICIA: 
 Nick flies under the radar. 
Nick flies very much 
under the radar, 
and Nick is a total player. 
I don't trust him as far 
 as I can spit. 
I mean, I feel Nick 
would screw all of us. 
Nick is very lazy. 
Don't let me take the fire with 
me, as I drag this through here.
He won't pick up anything, 
 he won't lift anything. 
If you ask him to help you, 
he'll act like 
 he doesn't hear you. 
Thanks. 
 NICK: 
 I'm sorry.
I didn't hear what you said. 
JEFF V.: 
That's okay. 
I'm zoning out. 
You know what? 
He's too secure 
in his position
 right now. 
Yep, absolutely. 
JEFF V.: 
 He's done our kitchen, 
 which is lovely. 
And he's built a lovely 
 little outdoor chair 
and he's built a lovely 
 little patio, but only because 
he doesn't want 
 to do anything else. 
NICK: 
 Mentally, you need to feel like
you're comfortable 
 where you are. 
And that's why 
 I built the kitchen. 
I mean, the kitchen serves, 
you know, little purpose, 
but it looks good, 
 it makes you feel comfortable. 
It's noticeable 
 that you're doing work, 
which makes people happy. 
Nice! 
I kind of built you 
a recliner, Rodger. 
Hey, you get that done 
where I can sleep in it. 
KIMMI: 
 I just don't see the necessity 
in making benches 
 when we need firewood. 
I think that 
 that's not a priority, 
I think that's a luxury. 
JEFF V.: 
 Unfortunately, we need him, 
so, you know, what can we do? 
He's one of 
 our stronger people, but... 
when we get to a point where 
somebody in our group has to go,
he's going to be the first. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
MITCHELL: 
 When it rains, 
 it's a scary moment. 
If the fire goes out, 
 everything around us is wet, 
and we only have 
 a couple matches. 
JERRI: 
 It was at the point 
 where it was almost out, 
and there was hardly 
 any light coming off of it. 
And no heat at all. 
Do you have some of that grass? 
It was really raining hard. 
We were not going to let 
 the rain win over our fire. 
It just wasn't going to happen.
( thunder ) 
TINA: 
 Tired. 
That was a rough one. 
Cold... 
rainy... 
pretty miserable. 
MITCHELL: 
 My side of the tent 
 was all wet, 
so I had to sleep in 
 wet clothes 
with a wet blanket and sand, 
and I can't recall sleeping 
 even a full hour. 
MARALYN: 
 Last night was a hard night. 
It poured. 
I mean not just a little 
 drizzle, it just poured. 
KEITH: 
 People fight sometimes, 
 they put the fire out. 
We were up all night trying 
 to keep that fire going. 
I think the hardest thing for 
 me so far has just been trying 
to catch up enough sleep 
 so the body's ready 
to go into combat 
 in our challenges. 
JERRI: 
 Everybody's kind of getting 
 a little lethargic. 
The fish definitely helped, 
that was a big morale booster. 
But I sense we're kind of 
 on a downslide right now 
and it kind of scares me 
 a little bit. 
MITCHELL: 
 When you think about 
 how low you are on nutrition 
and how hungry you are, 
being tired just... 
 just quadruples it. 
Getting mail is always 
 an exciting thing, 
but I was so weak walking up 
 that hill to get the mail, 
it was treacherous for me. 
And I knew, 
I knew that inside 
there would be a challenge 
that I may not be able to do, 
and that was a depressing 
 thought for me. 
( rattling ) 
We got mail. 
Sweet! 
Percussion! 
MITCHELL: 
"I think that you'll find 
 that your tribe's in a bind, 
"between a hard place 
 and a rock. 
"But if you work as a team, 
 it's not as hard as it seems. 
Pull together and your win 
 is a lock." 
JERRI: 
Ropes-- maybe tug of war? 
COLBY: 
Bind. 
"Bind" in here, which means 
 maybe something's bound 
with ropes. 
 Maybe we're all 
 going to be tied up
or something. 
"Rock and a hard place," 
probably going to have 
to do with rocks. 
Gosh... I'm a little weak 
 for climbing rocks. 
COLBY: 
 It's not the time 
 to be weak, brother.
I know. 
COLBY: 
 I'm dragging. 
This is the most tired 
 I've been. 
Personally, I'm a little 
 worried about myself. 
I know I'm not going to be 
 as strong going into this one 
as I have been in the past. 
Come on down, guys. 
Welcome to your toughest 
challenge yet on Survivor. 
Let me get that immunity idol. 
Today's challenge 
is very simple in concept 
and very tough in execution. 
It's an obstacle course. 
You're going to start by 
 racing through a log chute, 
then you'll go down a steep 
 sand slide into the river. 
On the other side, you'll go 
 through a series of obstacles. 
Then, finally, you're going 
 to sprint across the sand 
to the finish line. 
It's going to require a lot of 
physical endurance, flexibility,
and teamwork, 
because here's the twist: 
you're going to go 
 tethered as a team. 
( laughter, groaning ) 
You're only as fast 
 as your slowest member. 
Wow. 
If somewhere along the way 
a tribe member can't go 
 any longer, 
you can carry them, 
 but they have to finish. 
The first tribe to get all their
 members across the finish line 
wins immunity. 
Here we go, guys. 
Survivors ready! 
Go! 
Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Good, good, good, good! 
Good, good... 
Good. 
Come on, back there. 
Come on, come on, 
come on, come on. 
Good, good, good. 
Look out, look out, 
look out. 
Go, go, go! 
Go, go, go! 
( yelling ) 
Get on your belly. 
Okay. 
Come on. 
Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
Come on, come on, come on! 
Wait, wait, wait... 
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
We got it! We got it! 
Don't pull, don't pull. 
You gotta slow up 
 a little. 
Go, go!
Dig deep, dig deep, 
dig deep! 
Go, pick it up, pick it up! 
Come on, come on. 
Go... go...
Come on! 
Wait, wait. 
( indistinct shouts ) 
Come on! Come on! 
( indistinct shouting ) 
Stand up, Rodg, 
come on now! 
( woman yells ) 
Go! 
 Side by side. 
Stand up, Rodg, stand up! 
( yelling ) 
We got 'em, we're way ahead. 
Stay on your feet.
Let go of my hand. 
Stay on your feet. 
You're pulling me back. 
Come on! 
Rodg! 
Get up, get up,
 get up! 
Get on your feet! 
 Get on your feet! 
Pick it up! 
Get on your feet! 
Go, go, go! 
( yelling ) 
Go, go, go!
Pick up your feet! 
Come on!
Stay on your feet. 
Stay on your
 feet, guys. 
Come on!
Come on, pick it up! 
JEFF: 
 Right here's the finish! 
Come on, Rodger! 
( yelling ) 
Ow! 
Come on! Ah! 
JEFF: 
 Last member across! 
Last member across! 
Touch the table. 
 Everybody. 
Touch the table. 
JEFF: 
Kucha! 
( cheering ) 
Immunity! 
( panting ) 
ELISABETH: 
Good job! 
Good job, guys. 
Oh, my God! 
Good job, Kucha! 
We did it.
Oh, my God... 
We did it! 
Yeah! 
( whooping ) 
Yes! 
( trilling ) 
( gasping, muttering ) 
You digged deep. 
 You did it, Pops. 
I can't breathe. 
Give him space. 
Kucha, this is yours. 
You want this, Jeff? 
 Oh, my God! 
( whooping, cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 Ogakor... 
you guys know what 
 I'm here to tell you. 
Yeah. 
Tribal Council, one of you guys 
 will be going home. 
You guys always said, 
when it comes to teamwork 
and heart, Kucha's got it.
Kucha's got it. 
KEITH: 
 Our last immunity 
 challenge was a real tough one.
Mad Dog Maralyn, you know, 
 she had a difficult time. 
MITCHELL: 
 Had we voted for 
 Maralyn last week, and not Kel,
I can almost guarantee you we'd 
 have immunity right now. 
COLBY: 
 She's ready. 
She'll be 
very understanding. 
We're going to need Keith. 
TINA: 
 The mood in the camp 
 is a sad mood, 
but it's also a very 
 strategic mood. 
Everybody's thinking, 
 "Who's thinking what?" 
JERRI: 
 There's been five 
 of us: 
myself, Colby, 
Mitchell, Amber and Tina, 
who've kind of 
 decided to all vote the same. 
KEITH: 
 My vote's not going 
 towards Maralyn. 
We've had a lot of physical 
 challenges up till now, 
but I'm sure 
some of them are going 
 to be mental, 
and I think Maralyn 
could prove to be an asset. 
Why should we lose her? 
For what, 'cause she fell 
a few times, 
'cause she's
 older? Why? 
What kind of team is that? 
She works her ass off. 
She's the first one up 
 every morning with me-- 
you, me and her. 
Mitchell does all right,
but he struggles. 
And, you know, he doesn't do 
 a lot of work. 
When was the last time you've 
 seen him go up the hill 
and get wood? 
 Never. 
Mitchell's the weakest 
 of our strength 
of getting a lot of 
 heavy work done. 
When it comes 
 to the challenges... 
Maralyn, I think, 
is stronger than he is 
 in the challenges. 
And all we need is 
just the four of us. 
No pressure. 
TINA: 
Thanks, Keith. 
KEITH: 
 I could be 
cutting my own throat 
 doing this, 
but at least with Colby, 
 we can discuss it, 
probably disagree upon it 
 and it'll stay with us. 
COLBY: 
Keith's wanting to put you 
you on the chopping block 
tonight. 
And he's got Maralyn with him 
and he came to me and Tina. 
Strategies are starting 
 to develop more 
and go in different 
 directions, 
and the more we learn 
 about each other, 
the more you start to 
 second-guess what you've done. 
Keith is trying to 
 pull around a swing vote 
to try to get me out. 
Why would we want to kick off 
our fun Maralyn 
and then keep the pessimist 
 and the backstabber? 
KEITH: 
 You guys ready?
COLBY: 
 At this point, 
Keith and Mitchell 
 and Maralyn 
are neck-and-neck for 
 Tribal Council tonight. 
So let's talk 
about the fact 
that you guys have been 
here... 
nine days? 
Yes. 
JEFF: 
You're in 
the honeymoon stage. 
It hasn't even 
begun yet. 
So I just want to talk about 
 a couple of big topics: trust. 
Colby, is there 
anybody here 
that you don't trust, 
that you wouldn't trust? 
 Sure. Sure. 
Tell me about that. 
Well, I think that's 
 part of the game. 
It's way too early
 to tell exactly 
who you can trust, I think. 
What about you, Mitchell? 
You trust everybody 
here for 42 days? 
Uh I think the 
 motto is "trust no one." 
I have a lot of faith 
in a good number 
of these people, 
but I couldn't give 100% 
of my trust. 
What about you, Mad Dog? 
Are these all your buddies? 
Yes. 
Yes, and Jeff, 
 I trust with my heart. 
JEFF: 
Jerri, 
who here would 
you say 
you're closest to so far? 
Um... I've been very 
 fortunate 
in my ability to bond 
with Amber
and Mitchell
and Colby,
in particular.
I think friendship does
enter into it 
 at some point, 
but it's very important
to keep that separate 
 from the game. 
It's two totally 
 different things, 
and that's where 
 it gets tricky. 
JEFF: 
Keith, who have you 
bonded with? 
Uh, several individuals.
You know, and I guess I equate 
 the bonding 
different than friendship. 
I think it's more of
 a camaraderie for me
than it is an 
 actual friendship.
MARALYN:
 Jeff, 
I'm conjoined 
with Tina. 
JEFF: 
Really? 
( laughs )
She is a constellation. 
And...
the cowboy. 
Yeah. 
Oh, the poor cowboy 
has dragged me around 
so many times. 
I'd do it again. 
I appreciate it, Cowboy. 
You hear that, he'd do it again.
I'd do it again. 
Colby, are you sad 
 at all tonight? 
Yeah, yeah, I am. 
Because any way 
 the vote goes on this, 
the seven of us 
 are really tight, 
so the inevitable 
 is here. 
We're broken up
 after tonight, 
and that's tough. 
No matter which way it goes. 
JEFF: 
It's time to vote. 
Mad Dog, you're up first. 
Mitchell, it just seems 
like you're tired. 
JERRI: 
 This is probably one 
 of the most difficult things 
for me to do right now. 
It's purely strategic. 
It's nothing personal. 
I am going to miss 
 you dearly. 
Mad Dog, I love you, 
I value your friendship 
more than anything. 
This vote has everything to do 
 with a promise I made. 
It has nothing to do with you. 
I hope you'll understand. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
the decision is final, 
and the person will be 
asked to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
immediately. 
I'll read the votes. 
The first vote... 
Jerri. 
Maralyn. 
Mitchell. 
Mad Dog. 
Three votes, 
Mad Dog. 
And a very sad Mad Dog. 
You need to bring me 
your torch, Mad Dog. 
Mad Dog, 
the tribe has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Bye. 
JEFF: 
Well, I don't think 
I have to ask 
how you guys are 
feeling tonight. 
I think the last vote 
probably says it all. 
Grab your torches, 
head back to camp. 
Stay tuned for scenes 
 from next time, 
and Maralyn's 
 final words. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Will Keith and Tina wage war 
against Jerri? 
I didn't come out here 
 to be pushed around 
by a bartender 
 wanna-be actress. 
JEFF: 
 And at Kucha, has Michael's 
blood lust gone too far? 
Oh, my God, oh, my 
 God, oh, my God... 
We've reached a new level. 
MICHAEL: 
 If I go out, I'm 
 going out full. 
( wry laughter ) 
I cannot thank you 
 enough for selecting me, 
and this experience has 
 meant so much to me. 
At 52, I could feel myself 
 really coming alive. 
Oh, hell, I'm tired. 
Did this all really happen? 
Did I... did I do this?
