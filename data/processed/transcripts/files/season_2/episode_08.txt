         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Kucha and Ogakor 
merged into a new tribe 
at equal numbers 
 with five members each, 
calling themselves Barramundi. 
The tribe set up camp 
on a new beach, 
 and started from scratch. 
( cheering ) 
In a test of endurance, 
 the first individual 
immunity challenge 
 lasted over ten hours. 
Tina stepped down to give 








the more vulnerable Keith 
 immunity 
so that the ex-Ogakor tribe 
 could take the advantage 
at Tribal Council. 
So, we're ruling this 
 a deadlock vote. 
Colby and Jeff 
 were deadlocked in the tie, 
so Jeff's votes at 
 previous Tribal Councils 
tipped the scales, 
and Jeff was voted 
 out of the tribe. 
Nine survivors remain. 
Who will be voted out tonight? 
RODGER: 
 It's a late-sleeping
 bunch, isn't it? 
ALICIA: 
Yeah. 
A lot different
 than, than us. 
I know. 








Mike would've been 
 up three hours ago.
I know. 
Every time I do that, 
I think about old Mike. 
No kidding. 
And, you know, every
 time from now on, 
when we're around the 
 fire, we will think of it.
Yup. 
RODGER: 
 After the last Tribal Council, 
I just felt like we had 
 been outwitted by Ogakor. 
Kucha's tribe could be 
 picked off very easily. 
They're in a good position 
 to do that. 
We could be an extinct tribe, 
no longer 
 on the face of the Earth. 
To me, it's, uh, one-on-one, 
and every man for himself 
 from here on out. 
That's how I like to catch 'em. 
I am in it to win 
 just like anybody else. 
I'm going to give it 
 my best shot. 
My game plan right now 
 to try to assure my survival 
is trying 
 to keep catching fish. 
Ooh, yes. 
If they're going 
 to vote somebody off, 
it's going to probably 
 not be the person 
that is supplying them 
 with the food. 
And I think that is 
 my greatest asset at this time.
I love this fishing hole. Whoo! 
Love it. 
Wow, look at the crocodile. 
NICK: 
 Do not want to go 
 in that water again.
ALICIA: 
 This game 
 has definitely changed. 
There's no doubt about it. 
It's a whole new game. 
New people. 
New set of rules. 
You keep on 
catching fish, 
you'll definitely be 
the last of Kucha to go. 
ALICIA: 
 Ogakor knows they're 
 in a good position now 
to be the last five, 
 but they also 
have to know that four members 
 on this jury now 
are going to be Kucha members, 
and these people decide 
 who's going to be the winner. 
They'd better start stepping up
 and being real nice to us. 
It's like I'm on a 
 fishing trip with you.
It's like I'm with
 my older brother, 
and he's taking
 me fishing. 
RODGER: 
 Everybody is-is real nice 
 to everybody else, 
but then you can still see 
groups getting off and talking, 
and you know 
 what they're talking about. 
You know, the million dollars 
 for being the final survivor 
is on everybody's mind. 
AMBER: 
 We're exactly where
 we want to be. 
COLBY: 
As a team, Ogakor, 
we outplayed 'em. 
It's just like I feel like 
so much pressure has been lifted
 off my shoulders. 
I agree. 
I-I'm sleeping 
so much better now 
after getting past the merge 
 and the final... 
the final vote to see who, 
 who grabs the majority. 
I know.
And we won. 
Geez! 
KEITH: 
 Yeah, I think Ogakor 
 was definitely a team 
that stayed out of vision, 
knowing that we needed 
to whittle down 
 the Kucha people. 
Kucha knows what we're doing. 
They are really good, 
 nice people, 
and which does make it harder 
 as the days go on. 
And the closer 
 you become to an individual, 
you start questioning, 
"Geez, you know, 
I like this person better than 
somebody I know on my own team."
RODGER: 
 Well, if I had to guess, 
I'd say somebody 
 in your all's group 
is going to be a millionaire. 
Well, you don't count 
 yourself out, my friend.
It just seems natural 
that certain individuals 
 gravitate to each other, 
and Tina and I 
 have made the decision 
that we want to be with people 
we like right at the very end. 
ELISABETH: 
 You know Rodger has my heart. 
I love him. 
He's a good one.
I love him. 
See, I knew you guys 
would hit it off, too. 
I like him.
You go into a merger, 
thinking that you're 
 very much allied with a team, 
but then, as time goes by, 
 you might find out 
that there's people 
that are more deserving, 
 you know? 
I want this to be 
 on an individual basis, 
and I want the good guys 
 to win. 
JERRI: 
 Today has been just so weird. 
I feel, like, a lot of distance
between myself 
 and everybody else right now. 
We do have the advantage now. 
We're five... Kucha's, 
 to Kucha's four, 
but that's not relaxing me 
 at all. 
It's the paranoia 
 again setting in. 
We're in a situation 
 where Tina and Keith 
could team up 
 with the Kucha people. 
You cannot be complacent. 
Your back will be stabbed 
 faster than you can spit. 
( clattering ) 
 Ooh! 
TINA: 
 Ever since the beginning, 
the cooking of the rice 
 has been a problem. 
It was a problem at Ogakor, 
and the same problem 
 came with us to Barramundi. 
Basically, what it is 
is the rice has to be cooked 
 to Jerri's specifications. 
It has to be stirred 
a certain number of times. 
The lid has to stay on. 
It has to be... 
perfect, you know, 
 or... you-you catch it. 
What kind of spices we 
 getting tonight, ladies?
A little parmesan pizza mix. 
ALICIA: 
The lemon pepper 
is not great 
in the rice. 
It's not? 
No. 
Not great. 
ELISABETH: 
 Alicia and I 
were on the side of the fire, 
and Jerri and Amber 
 were sitting on a log 
just watching 
 every move we made. 
Every time I would, 
 I would take a lid off, 
I could see them, 
 you know, tensing up, 
like, you know, 
"Why is she taking the lid off? 
Why is she stirring now?" 
Be careful. 
TINA: 
 They're not 
 going to go.
They're not 
 going to go.
AMBER: 
If you guys 
have a knife, 
a knife might be easier 
to stir. 
ELISABETH: 
 Well, don't even
 worry about it. 
TINA: 
 She actually got it.
You got it? 
ELISABETH: 
 Alicia and I 
were getting more tense 
trying to make it. 
You know, 
 we were testing the rice. 
We always test it 
 to make sure it's done, 
and Jerri's over on her log. 
"It's mushy," she says. 
Mashed potatoes. 
ELISABETH: 
 I know you don't
 like mushy... 
but it's mushy.
ALICIA: 
 I'll stir it until it's done. 
JERRI: 
I guess it doesn't 
really matter. 
It's such crappy rice, 
anyway. 
ELISABETH: 
 I felt as if I were under 
a magnifying glass, 
 and I do not need to be meant 
to feel that way at all. 
Like, don't tell me 
what I'm supposed to be doing 
when I'm making you dinner. 
Don't. 
Whenever you have 
a whole bunch, 
it's really hard to make it, 
 I think. 
Poor little Elisabeth 
 was sitting there 
trying to cook the rice, 
and Jerri made some comments 
 about it. 
It hurt Elisabeth's feelings, 
because here she is, 
 trying to help the tribe, 
and then to not 
 be appreciated for it, 
and to be judged-- 
that's very hurtful. 
And I think that right there 
 probably was enough 
for Elisabeth to say, 
 "You know what? 
You'll get my vote." 
I try to stay away 
from cooking 
so I don't have 
to be judged. 
Ah! 
ELISABETH: 
 Within Ogakor, I already 
am spotting some cracks. 
There is definite dissent 
between Tina and Jerri. 
Does everyone have 
 something to eat with?
TINA: 
Yes. 
Okay, hold on. 
Amber, thank you. 
Rodger would like 
 to say a blessing.
That's a good idea. 
You ready? 
Yes. Everybody ready? 
Father God, we give Thee 
thanks today 
for this beautiful 
Lord's day, 
and for all Thy many 
wonderful blessings. 
We thank Thee, dear Lord, 
for this opportunity 
which we have as a group 
to come to know one another. 
ELISABETH: 
 If things are going 
 to get really crazy, 
especially now, you know, 
seeing that there is a hole 
 in Ogakor, 
it kind of opens the door 
to really take advantage 
 of that. 
If they're not all together, 
their plan's kind of wrecked. 
RODGER: 
All these things we ask 
in the name of our lord 
and savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. 
ALL: 
 Amen. 
TINA: 
 Thank you, Rodger.
That was nice. 
ELISABETH: 
 It wasn't until today 
that I really started feeling 
 like, okay, Elisabeth, 
do what you can do 
 to take Kucha to a victory. 
If you want 
 to keep playing this game... 
you better get 
 a little more ruthless. 
( birds singing ) 
I'm gonna try 
 to catch something 
with a cork, and I just bet 
 I don't have any luck. 
With a cork? 
Yeah. 
Oh, we're just 
sitting ducks now. 
ALICIA: 
 You know what?
 Whatever. 
Sitting ducks sitting 
by the fire. 
It's not fun anymore. 
Laying down and talking
to everybody at night 
 is not as much fun 
as it used to be. 
No, no, no... 
 You know? 
Waking up in
 the morning 
and seeing 
 everybody's face--
not as fun as 
 it used to be.
It's not fun anymore. 
ELISABETH: 
 You're not here to sit back 
and wait for someone 
 to vote you off. 
I just really would love 
to just light a fire 
 under everyone. 
Well, that makes me sick. 
I'm not going to sit here 
and be a sitting duck. 
ELISABETH: 
 No one else wants 
 to keep playing, 
I'll do whatever it takes 
to stay out here longest 
and keep-keep Kucha going. 
I think there's a crack 
 in their tribe right now. 
Watch.
You guys, pay attention
 to Jerri and Tina. 
Pay real...
RODGER: 
You think it's going 
to be women against the men? 
Pay attention to... 
No. 
No, because I think Jerri 
 and Tina have issues. 
And, yeah, well, 
Jerri and Keith... 
Watch out, 'cause she might
 be fishing around here. 
ALICIA: 
 Jerri and Keith
 definitely do. 
Yeah. 
RODGER: 
I'd like to see... 
J-Jerri does not love Keith. 
Yeah. You guys,
 honestly, 
well, I mean, 
 I know 
Jerri would be
 my next vote. 
Right. 
ELISABETH:
 Jerri, 
I think... 
I think she's gonna get votes 
 from their tribe. 
I honestly do. 
I'll tell you what. 
She definitely has the hots 
for Colby, 
and he is not at all... 
He just could care less. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm hoping Kucha will have 
 some pull, 
'cause people can't stand Jerri
 anyway in her own tribe, 
and I told them that maybe 
 we could approach Keith 
and Tina and say, "Look, 
"we'd like to get rid of Jerri. 
We're going to vote 
 for Jerri, too," 
grab some of their people 
 and have them come with us. 
It's gonna be fun these last 
few days whatever happens. 
Say something. 
ALICIA: 
I'm planning on having fun. 
Yeah. 
I really don't care 
anymore. 
I'm gonna go all out. 
ALICIA: 
 Elisabeth, although 
 she comes across 
as a, you know, a very meek 
 and mild kind of person, 
she is a serious competitor. 
Believe me, 
 Elisabeth is a force 
to be reckoned with. 
ALICIA: 
See, look at them. 
Nick's cooking two fish. 
I know. 
ELISABETH: 
 Tina and I have become close. 
I mean close, outback close. 
Outback close is... 
close enough to get the dirt 
you want on someone else. 
Close enough 
 to let you advance 
ahead of the person 
 you're trying to get close to. 
But then, last 
 night, she's, 
 like, complaining 
about how we're
 doing the rice.
I don't know 
 how you dealt with her 
that long in your tribe. 
Not an easy thing, sister. 
She'll get hers. 
It's coming. 
ELISABETH: 
 Ogakor's target is Jerri. 
I mean, the talk 
 I just had with Tina-- 
she can't take Jerri. 
Neither can Keith, 
 and they are trying 
to get votes for her. 
And I don't know 
 if I'm just a dumb optimist or 
just in denial, but I think 
 Jerri is ready to go. 
I'll say it for her. 
Jerri, you're ready to go. 
We got mail.
Oh, my goodness! 
( gasps ): 
Colorful mail. 
Boomerangs?
Oh, my gosh, 
 look at that. 
Oh, we're gonna have 
a boomerang contest. 
Mail, guys. 
 And boomerangs.
So, what do
 you think? 
TINA: 
 "The next challenge
"is easy. 
"Just catch the return,
"and a good start 
 for the morning, 
the winner 
 will earn."
You got to throw it 
 and catch it. 
You got to throw it 
 and catch it. 
Oh. 
I've never thrown 
 a boomerang. 
 Without getting... 
without getting hooked 
 in the teeth with it. 
Are we going 
 to have to, like, 
throw it at something 
 and like...? 
NICK: 
No. You got to make it 
come around in a circle 
and then catch it. 
ALICIA: 
You got to make it 
come back and catch it. 
( snickering ) 
Okay, guys, today's 
reward challenge-- 
boomerang toss. 
Most popular 
weapon in Australia. 
It's pretty simple. 
You stand inside 
 the white circle, 
throw the boomerang. 
The person whose boomerang 
comes closest to the red flag 
wins the reward. 
Make sense? Want to know 
 what you're playing for? 
ALL: 
 Yes! 
All right, Jerri, come here. 
( laughs ) 
JEFF: 
I'll let you read this off 
to the, uh... 
Oh, my God. 
...to the troops. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, it's a menu!
"Appetizer:..." 
Oh. 
( Jerri laughs ) 
"Smoked Salmon and Shrimp. 
"Entree: 
"Grilled Chicken, 
 Pasta Medley, 
"Greek Salad, 
Rolls with Butter."
Oh! Rolls... 
"Delicious Dessert:
Du Jour." 
It's a full meal! 
Oh! 
And it's a nice one. 
Rolls. 
 Rounds? Like, 
 not just one. 
That is 
 not... 
All right, let's go. 
Alicia! 
Yeah, yo. 
JEFF: 
Take your shot. 
Go, Alicia!
 Alicia! 
Go. 
 ( applause and cheering ) 
Pick one weapon.
Just one? 
 Just one. 
All right, get 
 up there, girl.
All right. 
JEFF: 
Give her a good run. 
It's coming back. 
Mark to beat, 
 right here, Alicia. 
Next thrower. 
Come on, baby, come on, baby, 
 come back to Papa! 
KEITH: 
Come on back to Papa. 
JEFF: 
 Alicia still the
 mark to beat. 
No. 
ALICIA: 
 It may be.
No.
JEFF: 
It's open. 
One decent toss, 
one good meal. 
Look at that. 
ALICIA: 
 That's a good one!
Jerri!
ALL: 
 Yeah! 
( applause and cheering ) 
Nicely done.
 TINA: 
 Good job! 
All right. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
JEFF: 
It's gonna be tough 
to beat. 
 Jerri, right here. 
JERRI: 
 Oh, my God,
 I'm hungry!
...for the rest of this trip, 
if you get supper tonight. Okay?
Oh, never. 
If I get... supper! 
JEFF: 
 South paw time.
Big mark to beat. 
Jerri's getting
 hungry. 
Ooh, that was good.
BOTH: 
 Whoa! 
JEFF: 
 Jerri still 
 in the lead.
I'm so scared.
JEFF: 
Give it a go, Rodger. 
Whoa. 
Oh. 
 Oh! 
Nope. 
Close.
Close, but 
 no... no supper.
JEFF: 
 Jerri has the 
 throw to beat.
No.
 No.
Up, next person.
Thank you, Amber. 
ALICIA: 
 All right, Amber. 
Whoo! 
You're it, 
 right? 
 Yup. 
ALICIA: 
 It's you or Jerri.
JEFF: 
 One challenger left.
Oh, my God! 
 Oh. 
JEFF: 
 We better 
 measure that. 
Oh, my God. 
ALICIA: 
 Oh, my God.
It's about an inch 
past 11... 
I am sweating. 
Don't even 
 look. 
Oh, my 
 God. 
Yup. 
Close, but no cigar. 
Jerri is the winner. 
ELISABETH: 
 You got it.
You have it.
 You have it.
 Oh, my God. 
You beat me, like,
 a few inches. 
ELISABETH: 
 Hungry girl,
 go now. 
JEFF: 
How ironic 
that you were the one 
 who read the menu. 
Yeah. 
 ALICIA: 
 Yup. 
JEFF: 
Yeah. 
 That is kind of bizarre.
Way to go, Jerri. 
 Anything on there 
interest you in particular? 
Every last thing on there. 
JEFF: 
Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
All right, let's go eat. 
Right now? 
JEFF: 
Yeah. 
 Oh, have fun... 
Bye.
 Bye.
JERRI: 
 This is 
 bittersweet,
though, really. 
 ( all talking at once ) 
COLBY: 
 Please, come on.
JERRI: 
 No, I'm serious.
We're going back to rice. 
I mean, what do 
 you mean? Come on.
I know, 
 everybody's hungry.
...your helping 
 of the rice tonight. 
Okay, good. Good. 
 ( chatter ) 
JEFF: 
 You know, there
 is enough food 
for one more. 
Yeah, you should
 pick somebody 
 else to come. 
Who really, really,
really, really 
 wants this? 
We all do. 
We all... 
 We all really 
 want it. Just pick.
Jerri, I think... 
Yeah, I think it's on you. 
Jerri, just pick. 
Just pick... 
Everybody will love you 
anyway. 
JERRI:
 Yeah. 
Amber.
You picked me? 
JERRI: 
 You-you got...
You got the 
 closest to me,
and you scared
 my pants. 
Thank you. 
TINA: 
Bye, guys. 
ALICIA: 
Bye, guys. 
Bye, guys. 
Oh, my God. 
 I feel like 
I just won 
the Miss America pageant. 
I know. 
 ( laughter ) 
All right, let's head 
 right over here. 
Wait until 
 you guys see
 the setup. 
Oh! 
Jerri, you can have a seat 
over here. Amber... 
Have her slide in here. 
Oh, my God! 
Look at the rolls! 
 Oh! 
Oh, my God. 
You were just talking 
 about rolls today. 
I love rolls! 
Oh, my gosh. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
Can this really be real? 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
JEFF: 
 Cheers to you guys.
Dig in. 
Cheers! 
 Cheers.
Thank you for choosing me. 
Thank you! 
Oh, my God, is that so good! 
Iced tea. 
Let's take our first bite. 
Oh, my gosh, 
 I'm eating a shrimp. 
Oh, my God. 
I don't even care 
that my fingernails are 
 completely and totally dirty. 
There you go. 
( laughs ) 
Oh, my God.
Mmm. 
Mmm, mmm, mmm. 
I'm gonna try 
 the salmon. 
JEFF: 
 So what's going 
 on back at camp?
JERRI: 
They're making rice 
over there, 
but they've got two 
 extra helpings of rice, so... 
( laughs ) 
JEFF: 
 Great trade-off.
AMBER: 
 Right, right. 
( laughs ):
 Yeah. 
Things are going good, though, 
 as far as, like, 
people getting along 
 and everything. 
ELISABETH: 
 This is the first time 
 since we got here 
that I feel just like 
kind of just relaxed, 
hanging out. 
KEITH: 
Isn't it nice? 
Enjoying dinner. 
Yeah. 
 ALICIA: 
 This is how it... 
KEITH: 
 What's missing?
What's making it feel that way?
What could that be? 
How can I put my finger on that?
( someone gasps ) 
 It's the shape 
 of our spaghetti! 
ALICIA: 
 You know what's
 kind of weird? 
KEITH: 
 The Wicked Witch of 
 the West isn't here.
ALICIA: 
 How could Amber
 have acted... 
That's what it is. 
...so surprised that she was 
the beauty queen that knew 
she was going to win... 
KEITH: 
It's all fake. 
...and, like, was, like, 
 "Oh, my God!" 
KEITH: 
Did you see...? 
 Did you see her face? 
I looked at her like, 
 "Okay, Amber." 
You chose me?! 
ELISABETH: 
 It was kind of funny, 
 because everyone else 
kind of felt 
 like we won the reward. 
That was probably the one time 
 I felt like Barramundi. 
We just kind of hung out. 
Everyone kind of vented 
about how they feel about Jerri,
and it was an eye-opener 
 to some people. 
I knew it. 
Well, see, I've cooked 
 for two Presidents. 
I've cooked 
for all kinds of people... 
ELISABETH: 
 Have you really?
 And I've never, 
ever, ever been stressed, other 
 than these last so many days. 
Isn't that weird?!
Never been stressed. 
 I can't 
 believe that. 
Over cooking rice.
ALICIA: 
 Over rice.
TINA: 
 I'm so excited.
I love spaghetti. 
 I'm so excited. 
ELISABETH: 
This isn't going to make 
a difference to me. 
I'll have rice. 
Honestly, please, because... 
I'm not kidding. 
 Thank you, Elisabeth. 
One of my worst foods. 
TINA: 
 You are so sweet--
 thank you. 
Thank you for, 
 like, Elisabeth,
giving some of
 her spaghetti!
( laughs ) 
ELISABETH: 
I just haven't seen 
you enjoy anything 
like this, Tina-- 
like, no reward... 
AMBER: 
 Talk about Tina being 
 extra chipper... 
She's had a constant
 smile on her face 
Mm-hmm. 
 since the merge.
She's been talking 
 in a different voice. 
I know. 
( falsetto ): 
 "Oh, you want 
 to go do this?
Want to go do that?"
( speaking gibberish )
It's unbelievable.
She's a completely
 different person. 
You got to really keep 
 your eye on Tina, 
'cause she has been acting 
 really weird. 
I'm, like, 
so sure that... 
she's going 
to backstab us. 
Oh, I totally agree.
Well... and she'd 
be doing it 
with people 
who would be ready 
to jump ship. 
 Yeah. 
Jump right on her ship. 
 Mm-hmm.
It's a completely 
 different game. 
Yeah. 
 Isn't it weird? 
Playing for yourself 
 is definitely different. 
So, we need to talk 
to... Colby. 
Yeah. 
To making it to the end. 
Yeah. 
I just would never 
 want to have to 
 make that decision.
Hey, ladies. 
 JERRI: 
 Hi, you guys! 
AMBER: 
 Hi. We come 
 bearing gifts.
Oh, you brought
 us a boomerang.
JERRI: 
 There's one bent one
 and one straight one
for everybody.
AMBER: 
 Everybody gets two.
It was very weird 
 coming back to the tribe 
after we had eaten our meal. 
Like, nobody even turned around
 to look at us. 
It was very uncomfortable. 
I didn't like the feeling 
 at all. 
TINA: 
 What kind of dessert
 did you get? 
I don't want 
to say anything. 
I know. 
 We-we feel... guilty. 
TINA: 
 We had a great time.
Don't you feel
 bad at all. 
COLBY: 
 When Jerri and Amber came back,
 I made my way 
down to the beach 
 just to get some... 
grab some time alone, 
 and Jerri came up, 
sat down beside me and decided 
 it was time for us to talk. 
The next person Amber 
 and my concern... 
with Tina and 
 Keith taking off
and gathering 
 three Kuchas...
Mm-hmm. 
...and coming after us.
She said the
 same as me--
like, she wouldn't
 doubt it, 
after that whole episode
 with Tina before. 
It's not good for 
 us to just assume 
that we can trust her.
Colby's kind of middle ground. 
Nobody really knows 
what he's... 
 what he's going to do, 
and he's not really letting 
anyone on to what his plans are.
I mean, have you ever 
 considered maybe... 
maybe, um...
even leading Keith 
 and Tina to believe
that you want 
 the three of them 
to be the 
 final three?
COLBY: 
 Keith and Tina? 
JERRI: 
 Yeah. 
 And myself? 
JERRI: 
 Have you... have you 
 ever thought maybe...? 
COLBY: 
 Oh, they're fully convinced 
 that's what's going to happen. 
Oh, they are? 
I mean, they've-they've- 
they've thought that for... 
For a while?
Before the merge, yeah. 
Oh, really.
And that's been my... 
Well, you 
 didn't tell me.
Well, I'm sorry. 
That's been 
my only bargain... 
That's been 
my only bargaining chip. 
So, the inevitable came. 
I was painted into a corner 
and-and had to lie to her 
to convince her that there 
wasn't anything going on. 
And I just said, "Look, Jerri, 
"Keith owes me one on this. 
"He and Tina think 
that the three of us 
 are going into the finals," 
which is the truth, but Jerri 
 thinks it's just a ploy. 
( thundering ) 
You and I and Amber
still have complete 
 control of this thing.
Okay, 'cause I-I was 
 completely unaware that,
at this point, you 
 were leading Tina 
 and Keith to believe
that it was going to
 be the three of you.
I haven't led them. 
They've assumed that. 
Okay. 
 Jerri doesn't deserve 
 to win this thing, 
if for no other reason, 
simply because of the way 
she's treated the people 
 around her. 
And that was 
 the biggest decision 
when I had to choose 
 between carrying my plans out 
with either Amber and Jerri 
 or Keith and Tina. 
Yeah, everything's cool. 
 And this is the deal. 
Do you think 
 it makes sense?
No, no, I didn't even, like, 
have to talk to him about that. 
Oh, really?
 Yeah, because he... 
Okay, go. 
 He, um, filled me in 
on something I was 
Yeah. completely unaware of. 
I didn't like the fact 
 that I had to lie, 
but because I was lying 
 to Jerri, 
I didn't lose sleep over it. 
Here, give me...
 give me a hug. 
I really owe you one. 
Are you so full of food, 
you can't? 
Is that tummy full 
 right now there? 
I want a hug. 
It's the biggest
 it's ever been. 
JERRI: 
 I buy it. I-I-I, uh, 
 I believe him, 
'cause to him... to him, right 
 now, winning is everything. 
So, I mean, I'm... 
I'm looking at this whole thing 
 right now 
as, yes, we are working 
 as a team 
to get to a specific point, 
and so that doesn't 
 leave me feeling 
very vulnerable at this point. 
Oh, boy.
Is that it?
Bits and pieces. 
Want to open that? 
No, let's go. 
 Let's wait. 
Screw them. 
 Open it now. 
( laughs )
Hey, you guys, 
we got tree mail! 
Ah, let see what
 we got here. 
I love puzzles. 
ALICIA: 
Aha! 
One more. 
This is the last piece. 
Probably just a straight line, 
 you guys. 
"When marking your land, 
 there can be no doubt." 
"Just fence off your spot 
 and keep others out." 
"You must plan ahead 
 if you want to succeed. 
It's hip to be square, 
 if it's immunity you need." 
ALICIA: 
Wow. 
NICK: 
What can it be? 
Very interesting. 
Uh, we got tree mail, 
and, uh, it says 
 for our immunity challenge, 
uh, we got to keep others 
 out of your land 
and fence each... 
 everybody off. 
That is very interesting. 
TINA: 
Cool. What if it's 
like one of those...? 
Whatever you think it is, 
think something else. 
Right, right. 
JERRI: 
 Alicia right now 
 is our biggest threat by far. 
She's got the guns, and she 
 out-strengthens even the men. 
The men are sweating it 
 right now 
over Alicia, so I think she... 
she probably knows that, 
and it's probably 
 very important to her 
to win immunity right now. 
Just... just hang in there 
and do your best, kiddo. 
Okay. 
All we can... 
 That's it.
can all do. 
I'll take back 
 the immunity necklace 
from you, Keith. 
Put it right back here. 
 Up for grabs again. 
Today's immunity challenge 
has nothing to do 
 with age or strength. 
It's all about how you think. 
We've created a challenge 
 using posts and rope. 
The object of the game: 
 connect the ropes to the poles 
to make as many squares 
 as possible. 
You'll each take turns 
 connecting one rope at a time. 
If it's your rope 
 that completes the square,
you drop a disk in it, 
 you go again. 
Person with the most 
 squares at the end 
wins immunity, 
 cannot be voted out 
at tonight's Tribal Council. 
Ready to go? 
Head over here to your disks, 
 and we'll start. 
The order in which 
 you'll take your turns 
we determined by drawing 
 numbers out of a hat. 
Jerri, you're up. 
 Get us started. 
JEFF: 
 Keith. 
All right, Amber, you're up. 
All right, Tina, you're up. 
Okay, Alicia, your turn. 
All right, Elisabeth. 
Go, Kentucky Joe. 
Let's go, Colby. 
All right, Nick. 
Okay, now it gets 
 a little harder, 
'cause any move you make's 
 going to either give you a box 
or set somebody else up 
 for a run, so choose wisely. 
A gift. First on the board. 
Somebody's going to have 
 a good run in a minute. 
Getting tough out there. 
It's getting tough. 
You can all thank me later. 
Nick can thank me now. 
Nick has one. 
Amber has one. 
COLBY: 
Did you leave 
Rodger a square? 
No. 
COLBY: 
Come on, Rodg, 
help a brother out. 
Now you're brothers. 
Yeah. 
Me and Rodg-- 
we go way back. 
 All family now. 
Four days. 
JEFF: 
 No box for Rodger. 
Let's see where 
 he left it for Colby. 
Colby has one. 
 See if he gets another one. 
Colby has two. 
There you go, Jerri. 
JEFF: 
 Looks like Jerri's on a run. 
Oh, that hurts. 
JEFF: 
 Good run. 
Six. Jerri 
 in the lead. 
Keith is anxiously awaiting 
 your next move. 
I'm sure he is. 
JEFF: 
 Nine. 
Keith, you hit the jackpot. 
I guess you have Jerri 
 to thank for that. 
Fifteen. 
Girl, you set him up. 
Yes, I did. 
JEFF: 
 16, 17. 
All good things come 
 to an end, though. 
I want a massage. 
JEFF: 
 Good run. 
Keith in the lead 
JERRI: 
Whoo! 
with 17. 
JEFF: 
 Amber, think 
 you can make a dent 
in Keith's 17? 
I got them all, right? 
RODGER: 
 Yeah, you got them all. 
Ah, this is killing me! 
TINA: 
It's killing me, too. 
ROGER: 
 Let's go. 
Oh, you guys. 
JEFF: 
 Tina has a plan. 
14. 15. 
16. All right, 
 Tina, you got 16. 
Keith's got 17. 
You got to find 
 one more spot on the board. 
This is for immunity. 
Yup, and I think 
 that's all of mine. 
JEFF: 
 Good effort, Tina. 
Not good enough. 
Mathematically impossible 
 for Keith to be beat. 
Nicely done, Keith. 
You get the immunity 
 necklace again. 
Congratulations.
Good job! 
JEFF: 
 Feels good, doesn't it? 
You're getting used to that. 
All right, you guys 
 can head back to camp. 
I'll see you tonight 
 at Tribal Council, 
where one of you will be 
 voted out of the tribe. 
Somebody's going home tonight.
( thunder crashing ) 
Lightning. 
TINA: 
 Whoa, that was close. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
And then, like... oh! 
( thundering ) 
RODGER: 
I love it here 
in the Australian outback! 
Whoo-hoo! 
KEITH: 
 Mysteriously, every time 
we go to Tribal Council, 
 we have a rainstorm. 
( thunder rolling, 
 lightning fizzing ) 
I don't know what that means, 
but you have to think 
there's something 
 working there-- 
stronger powers 
 than we're aware of. 
ALICIA: 
 Elisabeth thinks 
the next vote at Tribal Council
 will go for Jerri. 
I think Elisabeth is naive 
 in a lot of ways. 
You know, 
 Colby and Keith and Tina 
would be foolish 
 to vote Jerri off. 
It would put them 
 at a disadvantage. 
So, Nick and I both feel 
like it's going to be one of us 
 that they're targeting. 
ELISABETH: 
 I'm hoping that 
 that swing vote 
to get Jerri off is Tina. 
But I really think 
 Jerri is a goner tonight. 
And I just want to keep 
 playing. 
I'm not ready to go home. 
I'm not ready 
 to see my friends go, either. 
Tribal Council is going to be 
 much more interesting 
than the last, and... 
who knows what is going 
 to happen? 
Always seems to rain 
 at Tribal Council. 
Elisabeth, talk about 
 the tribes merging 
now that you've had a few days. 
Has it been 
 an interesting dynamic 
in two different ways of living 
coming together now 
and forming a new way of living?
It has. 
 It's been quite interesting. 
I mean, I think that we probably
couldn't have done things 
in a more opposite way 
when you look at the two tribes.
I-I just think that 
the differences are known. 
I mean, sometimes it's tricky, 
and you get used to doing things
 your own way, 
but, um, then 
 you realize that, 
well, there might be 
 a more efficient way, also. 
So, there's been compromise, 
and I think it's worked to 
 our benefit as a group so far. 
What was the reaction 
 last night, Amber, 
when you and Jerri came back 
with little bellies 
from a nice meal? 
It was a very weird feeling-- 
a guilty kind of feeling-- 
and I couldn't help but feel
like somewhat of an outsider 
 for a little while. 
So, what was it like 
 for you guys 
not having two people 
around last night? 
Different feeling, Alicia? 
ALICIA: 
 It was interesting
going back to camp 
just having seven people. 
It was, you know, 
 a little quieter, 
and everybody was, you know, 
kind of contemplating 
 the situation, and... 
and our situation.
Uh, a lot of us
 had already 
resigned ourselves
 to the fact 
that we'd be having
 rice that night, 
so, um, it was, it was all good.
Well, you nine have reached... 
really the final phase-- 
the last leg of Survivor. 
Someone will be voted 
out of the tribe tonight, 
 but they don't go home. 
They become a part of that jury,
and will have a big part 
 in how this thing plays out, 
because the jury will ultimately
decide who the winner is. 
You each have, right now, 
a one in nine shot 
 at a million bucks. 
So, this game 
 has really shifted now. 
The goal is get to the final two
with the goodwill 
 of the other seven. 
Every vote 
 from here on out counts, 
so you'd better think 
 about that 
when you're casting your vote, 
because the game has changed. 
Let's vote. 
Elisabeth, you're first. 
Tonight I'm voting for Jerri. 
I just feel 
 it's her time to go, 
and she gets really cranky 
 when she's hungry, 
and it's bumming me out 
 a little. 
My vote's for Alicia, 
 and girl, 
you are strong inside and out. 
And, uh, that's the main reason 
why I have to vote for you-- 
'cause you're threatening. 
So, this is a respect vote, 
and I'm going to miss you a lot.
Nice kid, 
but way too loud. 
Way too loud. 
Alicia, not only do you 
 intimidate the hell 
out of the women around here, 
but also the men. 
They are scared to death of you.
I'll go tally the votes. 
( music playing ) 
Once the votes are tallied, 
the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
to leave the Tribal 
Council area immediately. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote... 
Jerri. 
Very muscular... 
( laughing ) 
Alicia. 
Who did that? Who did that? 
Jerri. 
Alicia. 
Alicia. 
Alicia. 
Jerri. 
Jerri. 
Four votes Jerri, 
 four votes Alicia. 
Final vote... 
Alicia. 
Alicia, you need 
 to bring me your torch. 
Okay. 
Listen, Barrmundi, 
be safe, 
everybody here. 
See you in three days. 
See y'all in three days. 
Thank you.
Thanks, guys. 
Thank you, sweetie. 
Be good. 
Alicia, the tribe 
has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Bye, guys. 
Grab your torches 
and head back to camp. 
Good night. 
( music playing ) 
I have to say 
that I was expecting this. 
We knew that I was going 
 to be a threat, 
and I just hope somebody 
 from Kucha 
can take this thing out 
 and break Ogakor's spirit. 
It's all good, though. 
Now I get to sit on the jury 
and watch everything 
 that happens. 
Peace, out.
