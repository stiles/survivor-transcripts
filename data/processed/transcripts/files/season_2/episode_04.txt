         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
Michael was determined 
 to make a kill. 
This is the pig-killer. 
His stupid spear. 
"I'm going to go catch pigs." 
Go get me a pig. 
JEFF: 
 At Ogakor, Jerri and Colby 
whispered sweet nothings 
 to each other. 
Black coffee, or
 cream and sugar?
Cream and sugar. 
I'm such a sucker for cowboys. 








JEFF: 
 In the toughest challenge yet, 
 Kucha won immunity... 
( cheering ) 
...sending Ogakor 
 to Tribal Council, 
where lines were drawn 
 when Jerri 
made it clear 
 who her friends were. 
I've been very fortunate 
in my ability to bond with 
Amber, Mitchell and Colby. 
JEFF: 
 But there was no bond 
 with Maralyn, who was 
voted out of the tribe. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Thirteen remain. 
Tonight, one more will go. 
TINA: 
 I had slept outside last night,
 as did Keith. 
We were the first ones up, 
 so we thought, 








"First ones up, let's just get 
up and go fishing this morning."
So we cleared 
 everything off the boat, 
got the fishing rods together. 
Jerri popped up 
 out of the tent, ran, 
turned over the canoe 
and acted like she was 
going to get ready 
 to go fishing. 
KEITH: 
Guys want to go with us? 
You're going to take this? 
Yeah. 
Jerri and the others, 
they wanted 
 to take the canoe out. 
We said, "Well, we're just 
 getting ourselves ready, 
"we got all our gear, 
 we're getting 
ready to go." 
"Oh, we were going to do that." 
Well, isn't that ironic, 
 you know, 
just 'cause we were going to go?
TINA: 
 Well, that's why we
 were going to go, 
'cause you guys
 were sleeping, so...
( groans ) 
TINA: 
 I just said "Look, you know, 
 we were gonna go fishing. 
You all were asleep. 
 We're going to go fishing." 
And apparently, Keith wanted 
 to have a talk with me, 
so he said, 
 "Well, Tina, let's just go 
walk along the bank 
 and fish that way." 
KEITH: 
 So, at Tribal Council 
 last night, 
Tina and I had an opportunity 
to get a little bit 
 a better understanding 
of where we sit 
 within our own tribe. 
When Jerri was asked the 
 question who her friends are, 
she made a point of mentioning 
Amber, Colby, 
 Mitchell and herself, 
that they all get along best, 
 and then, of course, 
she wanted to make sure that 
 everybody was clear 
that she was here 
 to win the money, 
and she's going to do whatever 
 she has to to win the money. 
So, Tina and I were 
 a little miffed by that. 
TINA: 
 You have four or five young 
 people playing. 
They've got so much chemistry 
 that it is almost second nature
just to-- 
 woo-- just immediately 
gravitate towards one another. 
And it makes me feel 
 kind of like an outsider, 
which I am an outsider 
 at this point. 
It's all I can do to keep 
 from just laughing out loud. 
At Tribal Council, 
Jeff asked me who I felt 
 I had built friendships with. 
And immediately after I said it,
I kind of sucked it back up, 
 'cause I realized 
I was basically challenging 
 people to vote for me. 
Which doesn't put me 
 in a very good position. 
KEITH: 
 Jerri is perfect for this game.
She will ride the team 
 until it's time 
to take the knife out 
and cut someone's throat. 
That was good stuff. 
KEITH: 
 I didn't come out here 
 to be pushed around 
by a bartender- 
 wanna-be-actress. 
Maybe it's time just to shake 
 her world up a little bit. 
I can tell you one thing-- 
Tina and I are not going 
 to go down without a fight. 
I came here to win the money, 
but now my motive 
 isn't to win the money, 
but to do everything I can 
 to make sure 
she does not win the money. 
Wow, what is it?
I have no idea. 
ALICIA:
 You guys are not
going to believe this one. 
We got
 a chicken egg.
ALICIA:
 We have
 a real egg.
RODGER: 
"For a change of the menu, 
"you must work
 with great haste. 
Build a pen on your beach, 
and slide the pieces in place." 
This morning, 
 we received tree mail, 
and I went out there to it, 
and it was a bird's nest. 
And it involves a challenge 
 of building a chicken coop. 
Grab one end. 
All of these are 
 pretty much straight. 
I definitely have to appear 
that I'm into this challenge, 
because my head 
 was on the chopping block-- 
I know, 
with a couple of people-- 
because of, um, you know, 
 my almost not eating 
the worm 
 and the cow brain thing. 
At least 
 this chicken coop thing 
is a little bit 
 of a change of pace. 
I know it might seem ironic, 
because I don't eat mammals. 
You know, I haven't had 
 poultry in over ten years, 
and I haven't had red meat 
 in over 15 years, 
but if it boosts up 
 morale for these guys, 
it's going to be good. 
See, what I can do
 is I can pry this 
over with my pry
 bar here...
JEFF V.: 
 I want those chickens so bad. 
For one reason, 
 so Mike will quit fishing 
and walking around here 
 flexing his muscle. 
I really want chicken. 
And I'm not above 
snatching it out 
of the other team's arms. 
I want a chicken. 
JEFF: 
 Okay, today's challenge 
 is a reward challenge, 
and the map to your reward 
is scrambled in a puzzle. 
The first tribe to completely 
 unscramble their puzzle 
gets three egg-laying chickens 
 and one rooster. 
Big reward, a lot of eggs. 
Take your spots, 
 and we'll get started. 
Playing for three egg-laying 
 chickens and a rooster. 
Survivors ready? 
Go! 
No, no, back it up, 
back it up, back it up. 
Go around, rotate, rotate... 
Bring this one up and we'll 
 bring this one down. 
Right here.
( indistinct talking ) 
RODGER: 
 You got it made. 
Okay, well, we have this whole 
 side, so now 
we can work this, 
we got to do this piece... 
Yeah, swing this one like this. 
 Goes... no, leave that. 
Doesn't that blue piece 
right there go with... 
It goes
 in the middle.
It goes in the middle, 
that's right. 
Those two need to be together. 
That should be 
one, two, three. 
No, no, no, no. 
( indistinct voices ) 
That one he's got his hand on. 
Okay, hold on, 
hang on, hang on. 
( indistinct shouting ) 
( indistinct talking ) 
Wait a minute, look, look, 
look, look, look. 
This goes here, 
and we're done. 
( indistinct talking ) 
That piece goes right here. 
 You had it right. 
That one goes over... 
That-That goes down. 
 This goes over. 
( indistinct talking ) 
( cheering ) 
Kucha! 
( cheering ) 
( indistinct talking ) 
This is your map 
to your reward.
Now figure out where you're at, 
 where you need to go. 
No, wait, 
think about perspective. 
This is our blue, 
and that's their green. 
Yeah, "X" marks
 the spot. 
You guys, we're going straight. 
There they are.
Hello, my lovelies. 
( clucking ) 
( squawking ) 
 We got chickens.
ALICIA: 
 Henrietta, Polly, 
 Ruby and Rocky. 
JEFF V.:
 Hey, Henrietta.
 Hey, Ruby.
ALICIA: 
 We all have to decide 
who's going to carry what. 
I can't believe 
 I'm holding a chicken. 
Just don't hesitate 
 about putting him in. 
Get him down in there. 
Wait, don't break 
her wings, though. 
It ain't broken. 
Who's next?
ALICIA: 
You're going to squeeze 
four chickens...? 
They're giving you eggs 
and protein and vitamins, 
and all that 
good stuff, okay? 
Can't they give us some
 edamame, some tofu?
ELISABETH: 
This is a good thing, 
you guys. 
You guys, 
we just won a reward. 
It's, like, everyone 
just smile for a second-- 
 woo, reward! 
MICHAEL: 
 I felt when we won 
 the chickens, "Oh, no. 
I'm unnecessary for food now." 
They could eat a chicken 
 every other day 
and be totally fine 
 until the merger. 
And I thought to myself, 
"Consume those chickens 
 as quickly as possible 
so we're back 
 to being hungry again." 
( clucking ) 
Shh... 
NICK: 
 We woke up in the morning, 
Rodger and I relocated 
 the chicken coop, 
got them comfortable. 
And then all of a sudden 
 I see Mike 
preparing to kill the rooster. 
Everybody else is sleeping, 
 and I said, "Let's wake up, 
figure out what our day schedule
 is a little bit more 
before we kill it 
because if we had 
 killed that rooster, 
a lot of people would 
 have been upset. 
We have to make decisions as 
 a group for us to get along. 
We should decide 
as a group 
when we're going 
to eat it. 
That's what I asked him. 
That's what I 
 just asked you.
We don't 
need one today. 
( rooster crowing ) 
( crowing ) 
That one's going first. 
( fire crackling ) 
It's a fire. 
You can actually 
hear the trees 
falling down and burning. 
( crackling ) 
TINA: 
 You can hear it. 
I'll put on my tennis shoes. 
It seems to be getting 
 closer and closer. 
You can see ash 
 blowing in the wind. 
We have no idea how close it is 
 to our camp, 
even though we know 
 that it has to cross the water 
in order to get to us. 
It's a concern, um, but... 
you know, 
 I think we'll be safe, 
as long as we head for the water
and everybody 
 does the right thing. 
TINA: 
 And you don't realize 
 that you're nothing to Jerri? 
She said, "I'm in it 
 to win," and you know 
she's gonna do 
whatever it takes to win. 
She sees that we've got 
the fishing poles out, 
jumps up, grabs the boat, 
 turns it over. 
And it's like 
 she has to have her way. 
Yeah. 
 And I am so over it, 
I just can't hardly stand it. 
I mentioned my frustration 
with Jerri 
 because it's building. 
I don't know if it's just me. 
Do other people feel 
 the same way I feel? 
It's gonna get a lot worse 
before it gets better. 
 I'm sorry, 
she's the most bossy, 
domineering person 
 I've ever met. 
She's coming, by the way. 
Mm-hmm. 
TINA: 
 There was a little bit of it 
just wanting to see how strong 
does Mitch and Colby 
 align with Jerri. 
And my thought was, 
 if I could get Colby, 
that would be two of us. 
And then maybe Colby 
 could talk to Amber, 
and that would be 
 the only chance 
that I would have to make it. 
At this point, 
I don't have anything to lose. 
COLBY: 
 I had to get out of the tent. 
There's a little, uh, 
 estrogen overload 
in the tent right now, 
 and I just... 
I couldn't deal with that. 
Tina was taking things 
 way too personal. 
What happened last night 
at Tribal Council 
is what really set 
Tina and I apart. 
Jeff said, 
 "Well, who are your friends?" 
and Jerri named, you know, 
 four individuals, 
and Tina and I are sitting 
 on the sideline. 
So that was, you know, 
Tina and I just figured, "Well, 
it's just a matter of time now."
COLBY: 
 The powers that be 
have predetermined long ago 
 the pecking order here, 
and-and... also 
the elimination order, and, uh, 
Keith is up. 
Keith and I 
spend a lot of time together. 
Part of my reason for 
 doing it: one) we get along; 
two) we need Keith right now. 
So the last thing I'm gonna do 
 is alienate him. 
I'm cohabitating 
with people who-- 
what do I do 
with these people? 
I mean, who knows, man, 
you and Jerri 
could get married. 
I know that ain't 
 happening. ( laughs ) 
Tell you straight on 
right now, 
she ain't good enough for you. 
And, you know, 
it's cool you guys 
got your little 
thing going, 
but I'm telling you 
right now, 
she ain't no way 
good enough for you. 
I would beat you like a dog if 
 I found out you two hooked up. 
( laughs ): 
 Well, thanks, bro.
That girl'll 
cut your throat 
in a heartbeat. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
( Rocky crowing ) 
RODGER: 
 Everybody's on 
 the same wavelength-- 
we want to have chicken today. 
MICHAEL: 
I got a confirmation 
from Nick and Jeff, 
and Elisabeth said yes. 
And if us four are saying yes, 
everybody says yes. 
I say no. Okay.
( laughs )
Well. 
 Guess that 
 doesn't work. 
Nope. I say do it 
whenever you want to do it-- 
just let me know when. 
Well, we got to get
 the water going. 
I would love to have 
 fried chicken tonight. 
It'd be the first meal 
 where we didn't have 
to pass a piece of fish around 
 six or seven times 
and everybody take a bite of it.
Everybody'd have 
 their own piece of chicken. 
Oh, it's boiling. 
RODGER: 
 Boiling?
 Boiling. 
Rodger. 
Do we need anything
besides tools? 
Just a hatchet 
 and a block of wood. 
Alicia, I'm leaving. 
Bye, sweetie. 
I know it's harder for her. 
Just got to look at it, 
 it's no different 
than eating them fish 
 we been eating. 
I'm gonna hold his wings. 
Just-just make it a good... 
one good, clean blow. 
( hatchet strikes ) 
ALICIA: 
 Mm, mm, mm! 
MICHAEL: 
 Everybody was loving 
 the chickens. 
This could be the end 
 of the game for me, 
because they no longer need me 
 for a food source. 
It ups the stakes definitely 
 for me to catch the food. 
But to stay in the limelight 
 is gonna be harder 
and harder, because what... you 
got to keep one-upping yourself.
I caught one fish, 
 and then I caught a bigger one,
then I caught three fish, 
 then I caught five fish. 
What am I gonna do now, 
 wrestle an alligator? 
JEFF V.: 
 I'll take a chicken 
 over fish any day. 
Once you go dark meat, 
you don't ever go back. 
( laughing )
( bird cries ) 
MITCHELL: 
 I'm just weak. 
I'm hungry, I'm tired. 
Physically, emotionally, 
 I'm gone. 
I feel that I think 
the most about strategies. 
'Cause first of all, I don't 
 have much else to think about. 
And second of all, 
 I want to go far with this. 
After seeing Colby and Keith 
talking over in the water 
 for a couple of hours, 
who knows what he's trying 
to convince Colby. 
But you know what? 
Maybe he's just kind of 
taking Keith for a ride. 
Colby had been talking a lot 
 to Keith. 
We know Keith is trying 
to rear something up from behind
to try to take one of us out. 
The only way it would work 
 is if... Keith convinced Tina 
and Colby 
AMBER: 
And Colby. 
to vote against me. 
Right. 
And you... and us three 
 voted against Keith. 
It would be three and three.
A tie. 
And then you and me 
 with the most votes.
I'd be gone.
 Yep. 
JERRI: 
 This is definitely 
the first time I've felt 
 a little bit threatened. 
And I guess I deserve it 
after making that pompous remark
( laughing ): 
 at Tribal Council. 
Colby could be talked 
into things easily. 
Yeah, that's what 
 I'm thinking, too.
He's not real strong 
 in his own opinion. 
He... he sways a lot 
 between what people tell him. 
JERRI: 
 Colby does seem to be the one 
we're focused on 
 in trying to ensure he's not...
changing his mind. 
JERRI: 
Ah... there he is. 
You find a good spear? 
Yeah, I made a couple. 
Yeah? Cool. 
Colby was pretty excited about 
going out hunting for a pig, 
 and... 
I think it's a brilliant idea, 
especially with the fires 
 right now, 
'cause a lot of wildlife 
has been flushed this way. 
The fire pretty much stopped. 
It's always a possibility 
 that it could 
jump the river 
 and come over here. 
I think it's highly unlikely, 
because there's no wind, 
 nothing. 
COLBY: 
 See where all the ground's 
burning right there? 
Yeah. 
The fire was right there. 
See? It was right there. 
We'll walk back. 
COLBY: 
 We'd love to have a hog 
 around here. 
They're here, 
 we just got to find them, 
and I'm not having 
 a whole lot of luck. 
But I'm bound and determined 
to put pork on the plate 
before I leave this place. 
They're not gonna live 
on the water, I don't think. 
They're gonna burrow 
back aways, and, I mean, 
we don't have a whole lot 
of experience with hogs. 
JERRI: 
 I think Colby is definitely 
 separating the game from 
any relationship with me. 
I think it takes 
 a strong person 
to do that, quite honestly, 
 especially... 
( laughs ): 
 when there's obviously, 
you know, 
 some attraction between us. 
Where to, cowboy? 
I don't know. 
 We'll head this way.
Who knows where the heck 
 we're going. 
Jerri's scared. 
She's worried 
that Keith and Tina and I 
are gonna join together 
 and mastermind 
a backdoor move 
to, uh, to get rid of her. 
I don't want you to 
 lose an ounce of sleep
worrying about what 
 Tina's thinking or doing
or anything like that.
I'm not losing any sleep. 
 I'm just... 
I just know that 
she's thinking ahead. 
I just want to beat her 
 to the draw, that's all. 
I'm not saying 
 I'm holding out
on making a deal
 with you 
to see how this thing plays out.
I'm saying... there's no sense 
 in even making a deal, 
'cause if we go into 
 the merge undermanned,
it's all for naught, 
 you know? 
Don't worry about it. 
You know, it's not like 
 you're making a deal 
with the devil here. 
I'm a little leery of Colby, 
and I can tell, actually, 
 that he's sort of 
distancing himself from me 
 a lot more. 
And I like... 
hanging out with you, 
 so, you know, 
it just made sense to me... 
to approach you with it. 
I'll make you a deal. 
It's me, you and Amber 
 through to the end. 
Make me a deal? 
 What is that?! 
Well, you were wanting 
 to strike a deal earlier. 
( laughs ) 
Jerri probably wears a name tag
that says "Puppet Master" 
 on it. 
She loves having Amber 
 in her hip pocket, 
and Mitchell in the same place.
I mean, I simply agreed 
 to go along with them 
just because I thought it could 
get me down the road 
 a little better. 
It's all good. 
( Jerri laughs ) 
I want to win, 
 and I don't want 
to talk to anybody else 
 about loyalties. 
Don't give me that crap. 
I haven't trusted anyone 
 since day one, 
and anyone playing smart 
 should have been the same way. 
TINA: 
 What about the pigs? 
Nothing.
 No luck. 
We didn't even
 see anything. 
COLBY: 
I'm gonna have to piggyback your
 ass over this to keep you dry. 
JERRI: 
 Oh, my gosh. ( whoops ) 
Oh, you're all muscle.
I'm gonna need some rest 
when I get back. 
I'm gonna die. 
( snoring ) 
Elisabeth? 
Yeah? 
There's a pig 
 in the water. 
What? 
There's a pig 
in the water. 
A pig?
Yeah. 
 There is a pig. 
Right over there. 
Oh, God, 
Mike's gone with the knife. 
Why don't you guys come 
 and help me surround him? 
You guys, I got 
 him cornered here.
Just keep walking around
 the way you're walking. 
Don't charge me. 
MICHAEL: 
 He won't. 
You know, what 
 I want you to do
is I want you to block 
 off that entrance there.
All right. 
( pig squeals ) 
We got a pig. 
ELISABETH: 
 What? Got it? 
He killed it. 
It was gross, 
though, dude. 
He had to, he had to... 
I'm so glad 
Kimmi wasn't here. 
If she was, 
 she would've died. 
 Yeah. Where is she?
She would have died. 
It was, 
it was... 
 Brutal. 
Gross. It was very gross 
and brutal. 
Life is just a funny 
little blending of experiences, 
and this is just another one. 
 ( sharpening knife ) 
How it will affect me 
in the mind of the tribe, 
 I don't know. 
It could go either way 
 at this point. 
But if I go out, 
 I'm going out full. 
And I'm so happy about that. 
( chuckling ) 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, this is like
 a murder scene. 
When I butcher a deer, 
I use a hatchet 
and a knife. 
I think I need to cut the skin 
more on the top now, too. 
Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God. 
Lots of butchering 
 going on in Kucha camp today. 
This is nothing 
like a chicken, that's for sure.
We've reached a new level. 
That's the craziest thing 
I've ever seen in my life. 
This is how 
I'm going to show up 
at the immunity challenge. 
RODGER: 
Pig blood? 
ELISABETH: 
 Did you just put 
 that on your face?
JEFF V.: 
 Yeah, he did. 
Just like that. 
ELISABETH: 
 You're crazy. 
Mike caught a pig.
He actually 
 caught a pig. 
I cannot deal 
 with these people. 
I cannot... 
 How big of a pig? 
It's a little one.
And there's going 
 to be a lot of ham
 and bacon and pork
coming up in 
 here... soon. 
What is wrong 
 with you people?! 
This is sick. 
We live in a sick tribe. 
These are pure, fleshy steaks. 
ALICIA: 
 The fact that Mike had the guts
 to go after that pig 
says a lot 
 about Mike's character. 
I can appreciate the fact 
 that Mike did that, you know? 
And-and Mike did that 
 for the tribe. 
Mike killed this pig for us 
 so we can all eat. 
We're having a barbie. 
RODGER: 
Mm... that's cooked well. 
Oh, my God. 
Mm... 
ALICIA: 
 It's good, right? 
MICHAEL: 
 I feel better about my position
now that I've made this kill. 
I think my position 
 in the tribe 
has come up 
 a few levels, and... 
it's a good feeling. 
Whoa, we're going 
 to get strong now. 
COLBY: 
Got a little bit of love. 
"You all read the books 
 and crammed for the test 
"So now it's the time 
for 'Survivor Knows Best' 
"Head down to the falls 
with your thinking caps on 
If you lose the next challenge, 
 one more will be gone." 
JERRI: 
 First merge with equal 
amounts of people 
 on both tribes. 
We can't lose 
 another immunity challenge, 
so the pressure now 
is even more immense 
 than it was before. 
The next two immunities 
 are crucial 
for us and our survival 
 at the merge. 
JEFF: 
 I'll take back 
 the immunity idol.
The immunity idol is 
 now back up for grabs.
So, last reward, you guys must 
 be eating pretty well. 
We haven't really 
been eating the chickens much 
because yesterday we all 
went out on a, uh, pig hunt 
and we, uh, stalked a pig 
and, uh, we put a spear 
right through its heart, 
and, uh, we've been eating 
pig for about a whole day. 
Reaction? They caught a pig. 
We'd like to have one, too. 
You've been out 
 looking for pig?
Yeah, you bet. 
Well, today's 
 challenge-- 
certainly more important 
than chickens or roosters, 
even pork. 
At the end of this challenge, 
one tribe will return to camp 
 safe in the knowledge 
they're secure 
 for another three days. 
The other tribe 
 will head to Tribal Council, 
and you will vote another member
 out of your tribe. 
It's a simple 
question-and-answer game. 
There are six spots per tribe. 
You'll start at the back 
 and move forward 
by filling in the spots 
 with correct answers. 
Your goal: 
 Be the first tribe 
to get right here 
 on the yellow spot, 
you get immunity. 
All right? 
Let's go. Head down, 
 pick the first person. 
Michael, Mitchell, come on up. 
Multiple choice: 
"It is possible 
 to improvise a compass 
"by magnetizing a needle 
 with which of the following: 
"A) silk B) cotton C) hardwood 
or D) running water?" 
Show me your answers. 
You both say "A) silk." 
That's right. 
 Take your first spots. 
All right!
 All right!
Good job! Good job! 
Elisabeth, Keith, 
 come on forward. 
"True or false: The number of 
 flies in Australia increased 
after the arrival of Europeans?"
You both say "true." 
True is correct. 
Take your next spot. 
All right, Alicia, Amber, 
 come on up. 
"In order 
 to safely purify water, 
"it must be boiled for at least,
"A) five minutes B) ten minutes 
 C) 15 minutes 
or D) 20 minutes?" 
Correct answer: 
 "B) ten minutes." 
Take your spot. 
( cheering and whooping ) 
Ogakor has a one-point lead. 
Next two. 
The answer is "true." 
 Take a spot. 
We're even up. 
Alicia and Jerri, 
 back in the line. 
Colby going against Jeff. 
"True."
Yes! Yeah! 
 ( cheering ) 
Ogakor in the lead. 
Kimmi says false, 
 Jerri says true. 
"False" is right. 
Kimmi, take a spot. 
Alicia and Tina. 
What was that little thing 
 you just did, Alicia? 
Is that a little...
Just getting ready. 
Okay. 
Third time's a charm, 
hopefully. 
"Of the ten most 
 venomous snakes in the world, 
"how many live here? 
"A) three B) six 
C) nine or D) ten?" 
Both wrong. It's "nine." 
See you again in a minute. 
All right, Jeff, Jerri, 
 you both say "true." 
You're right. 
 Take a spot. 
Nick, Tina, you're both right. 
All right! 
Thank you, God!
Take your spots. 
( whooping ) 
Okay, Alicia, come on up, 
 and Mitchell. 
You'll be the tiebreaker 
 for Ogakor. 
Here's what I'm thinking: 
I'm thinking, this tiebreaker's 
a little tougher on you, Alicia,
because Mitchell at least 
 has already answered one. 
 Right. 
He can always fall
 back on that. 
 That's right. 
You haven't 
 answered squat.
I haven't answered squat. 
You'll be leading the 
 hike to Tribal Council.
Thanks for telling me. 
Thanks for just reassuring me 
 like that. 
We're in a tie-breaker 
 situation. 
If you both get it right, 
 we go again. 
First person to miss, 
 their tribe loses, 
they go to Tribal Council. 
Multiple choice: 
"Which of the following animals 
 have toxic eggs 
"which should not be touched? 
"A) gowannas, B) cane toads, 
"C) echidnas 
or D) bearded dragons?" 
You both say "B) cane toads." 
You're both right. 
Going to another question: 
"When building a fire, 
"you should never use dead wood 
 to start the fire-- A), 
"B) situate your fire 
 near a rock slide 
C) place wet rocks near the fire
or D) use a car battery 
 to start the fire?" 
For immunity. 
Mitchell says "B) you should 
 never situate your fire 
near a rock slide." 
Alicia says "C) you should never
place wet rocks near the fire." 
"C)" is right. 
Kucha wins.
( wild cheering ) 
Kucha, you get 
 the immunity idol back. 
We're feeling kind 
 of blah right now, 
and I'm not too excited to make 
 that hike again tonight. 
And so we prepare 
 once again 
for the walk of shame. 
I'll have plenty to 
 say to the camera 
when I hold up Keith's name. 
He seems to be 
 an instigator 
of some problems. 
So, when he goes, 
 it'll be 
a sigh of relief for me. 
KEITH: 
 Jerri likes to think 
that she is the leader 
 in some way 
because Amber and Mitchell, 
she kind of leads them 
 around a little bit. 
My goal tonight 
is to try to step in 
 and break all that up. 
I'll offer my opinion 
 to the team 
and see what everyone 
 chooses. 
I don't think 
he has any idea. 
MITCHELL: 
 Really? 
TINA: 
He didn't take his 
fleece or his jacket. 
COLBY: 
 This, by far, 
 is going to be the toughest 
Council for me because 
 I don't agree with the order 
in which the union is voting. 
Because the person 
 to go tonight 
is-is a huge asset 
 and could really, really 
be an asset down the road. 
First I think I need 
to address with you guys 
a fire that is burning. 
Keith, when you think 
about that, 
that there truly is a fire, 
does it hit you how real 
it is out here? 
Absolutely. 
And the fact that the fires 
are burning so close, 
what they're going to end up 
 doing is pushing things 
that are in the outback 
 towards us. 
What was your reaction 
to the fact 
that Kucha 
bagged a pig? 
I'm ticked off 
 that we don't have pigs yet. 
I'm ticked off 
 that I haven't seen pigs 
or-or pheasants or quail 
or anything 
 of that sort, 
but I'm not 
 discouraged by that.
Why I'm upset 
is because I play to win, 
and nothing else 
is acceptable in any way. 
Sort of based on what 
 you just said, Colby, 
let me make the observation 
 of the day: 
Kucha is kicking your ass, 
and the question 
I have is-- 
Does it change your 
strategy tonight at all 
in thinking about 
what tribe do we need 
to take 
to this merge? 
That's the hardest part 
 about this game, 
because you are pulled 
in so many different directions.
You're pulled with loyalty,
you're pulled with
self-survival,
you're pulled with
 team survival. 
And it boils down to you. 
You're going to have to be 
 the one to make the decision. 
And... it's brutal. 
Well, obviously, 
tonight's vote 
is pivotal. 
Behind me, 
three torches.
Two of the three-- Ogakor.
It's time 
to vote. Colby. 
Keith, 
you add some tension 
to the group at times, 
and my hope is that 
by eliminating you, 
we eliminate a little bit 
 of that friction. 
This was not 
my original intended vote. 
However, on the way here 
to Tribal Council, 
a new scheme 
was developed. 
So, in the spirit of the 
 Olympics, let the games begin. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person will be asked 
 to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
 immediately. 
First vote... 
Keith. 
Keith. 
Keith. 
Three votes, 
Keith. 
Mitchell. 
Mitchell. 
Three votes Keith, 
two votes 
Mitchell. 
We have a tie. 
Okay, our first tie. 
Here's how it'll work-- 
Keith, Mitchell, 
you will not vote. 
The other four 
will vote again. 
Obviously, 
a big vote for Ogakor. 
I think it's only fair 
that I give each 
of you guys a chance 
to plead your case, 
a chance to say to the tribe 
why they need you 
to beat Kucha. 
Keith? 
I'm a competitor, 
 and I will fight 
to the bitter end 
 to win for this team 
and continue 
 to do the heavy work 
that I've contributed 
 with the team thus far. 
I won't give up. 
Mitchell, 
why should they keep you? 
( sharp exhale ) 
We all pulled 
a little fast one on me, but... 
but I agree 
with Keith, 
actually. 
I want you guys 
to win this. 
I want you guys 
to go on. 
I want you guys 
to beat Kucha. 
And physically, mentally, 
emotionally, I'm drained. 
I wanted very, 
very badly to go far 
 in this game, 
but if these next 
few challenges 
are strictly strength, 
Keith is stronger 
than I am. 
I can't compete 
with that. 
There's no way 
I can compete with that. 
JEFF: 
Okay. 
We'll have a revote. 
You will vote 
for either Keith or Mitchell. 
You are voting to vote 
 them out of the tribe. 
All rules stay the same, 
but you have to vote 
for one of the two. 
Jerri. 
Mitchell, I promised you from 
the very beginning of this game 
that I would not vote 
for you, 
and I am staying true 
to that promise. 
This game isn't easy. 
I didn't come out here 
to starve myself 
and to face the elements 
to keep the weakest person. 
I'll read 
the tiebreaker votes. 
Keith. 
Mitchell. 
Mitchell. 
We have 
another tie. 
It seems 
 we're deadlocked. 
In the Survivor rules, 
in a deadlock, 
you go to votes 
cast in previous 
Tribal Councils. 
The tribe member 
with the most votes 
is the person voted out. 
How many votes have you had cast
 against you, Keith? 
None. 
Mitchell? 
One. 
One. 
 One vote is the difference. 
I need you to bring 
me your torch. 
It's been a long vote, 
Mitchell. 
The tribe has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Well, I have 
a feeling that 
tonight's Tribal Council 
is going to have 
a monumental effect 
on this tribe. 
Grab your torches, 
 head back to camp. 
Coming up, scenes 
 from our next episode 
and Mitchell's final words. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Will Ogakor continue 
 their losing streak? 
COLBY: 
 Excuses are done, 
 check them at the door 
and let's 
 get down to business. 
It is going to be one hell 
 of a show today. 
And at Kucha, the feathers fly.
I'm tired of you 
 and the... chickens!
Excuse me? Don't wave 
your finger in my face! 
I will always wave
 my finger at you. 
You want me 
 to say it to your face? 
Yes! 
That definitely 
 took me by surprise. 
But I guess the bright side is,
 I get to eat, 
and I need to eat. 
 Look at me... cripes. 
I feel a little bit betrayed 
 by some of them, 
but at the same time, 
I want to shake their 
 hands and congratulate them 
for pulling the wool 
 over my eyes 
because they definitely got me.
