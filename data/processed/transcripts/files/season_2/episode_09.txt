         JEFF PROBST: 
 24 days ago, 
 16 survivors were abandoned 
in the Australian Outback. 
The eight remaining members 
 of the Barramundi Tribe 
have now made it 
 past the halfway point. 
Tonight, in a special episode 
 of highlights 
and never-before-seen footage, 
 we'll take a closer look 
at their adventure thus far. 
I'm a captain in the U.S. Army, 
 and for them 
to question my integrity
over a piece of beef jerky 
 means a lot to me. 
RODGER: 
 Maybe I've been playing 








the Kentucky Joe part 
a little bit too much, 
 and maybe I need 
to come out a little bit more. 
? I've been a bad, bad girl. ? 
JEFF: 
 Day 1 found 16 strangers 
 abandoned 
in one of the most unforgiving 
 places anywhere on Earth-- 
the Australian outback. 
As two separate tribes, 
 Kucha and Ogakor, 
they gathered whatever supplies
 they could carry 
and began a five-mile hike 
 to find their camps. 
It didn't take long 
for certain personalities 
 to clash. 
DEBB: 
 You got the compass? 
Nick, stay in the front, Nick, 








and keep us going 
north to northeast, okay? 
NICK: 
 Even from the beginning, 
 it was funny, like, 
people were automatically 
 getting on people's nerves. 
We were walking 
 through the grass, 
and Kimmi was, like, 
 "I can't stand, uh... Debb." 
KIMMI: 
 Debb's not even a bad person. 
 She means well. 
It's just, she's not somebody 
that in the outside world 
that I would talk to, 
 because she'd make me crazy. 
See, if we're going 
southwest, 
how are we gonna hit 
the dry creek bed? 
Because that's north! 
That's right. 
You all right, Maralyn? 
COLBY: 
 That trek let me know 
that this was for real. 
That was a long trek we had, 
 through deep sand, 
and that fired me up, because 
 that is the quickest way 
to find out 
 what people are made of. 
This rice is very heavy. 
I really want to get there soon.
( whooping and cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 Once the tribes had found 
 the flags and canoes 
that marked their beaches, 
 the mood was upbeat. 
( whooping ) 
But with night approaching, 
Kucha and Ogakor turned 
 to the serious task 
of assessing 
 their living conditions. 
DEBB: 
 We got enough 
rocks here, too. 
We could build a pretty decent 
shelter just using rocks. 
MITCHELL: 
 Colby, his luxury item 
was the Texan flag, 
 which is great, because 
it covers us and blocks us 
from the wind and the sun. 
COLBY: 
 Don't get me wrong. 
When I wake up in the morning, 
 there's two things 
I'm thankful for: 
 I'm thankful I'm alive, 
and I'm thankful I'm a Texan. 
JEFF: 
 Keith and Jerri got off 
 to a shaky start. 
It was... No, but it's
 not gonna to stay. 
KEITH: 
 And before it was here. 
But, see, we put it
on the grommet 
for a reason, 
so that the flag 
wouldn't rip. 
You can't. 
You won't be able 
to go through that 
on a flat surface. 
JERRI: 
 Tension between Keith and I... 
I think him and I kind of... 
rubbed each other the wrong way.
JEFF: 
 On the first night at Ogakor, 
sleep was hard to come by, 
thanks to Colby. 
( loud snoring ) 
( snoring continues ) 
( snoring continues ) 
( whispering ): 
God. Has anybody gotten 
any quality of sleep? 
Colby. 
( continues snoring ) 
KEITH: 
 We added a new sound 
to the outback out here. 
Jesus. 
 All these critters 
 are going, 
"What the hell 
 is that animal?
( laughing ) 
I snored? 
KEITH: 
 Trust me, you 
 were snoring. 
It's like you had sucked
 sand into your nose. 
COLBY: 
 Oh, man!
It doesn't bother me much,
but might explain why 
I don't have a girlfriend, 
I don't know. 
( women groaning 
 sympathetically ) 
I hate to say it, but 
you're probably right. 
( laughter ) 
MITCHELL: 
 I'm a little annoyed 
because I'm waiting for Kelly 
 to pull his stuff together, 
'cause we're going 
 to go fishing, 
but it should be a good trip 
'cause he might tell me some 
 things that might be useful 
to any strategies 
that we may have planned. 
I mean, he's a nice-enough guy,
but if there is one person 
 to vote off right now, 
it definitely would be him. 
See, there's 
 like a rope hanging
from that limb over there? 
All right, now I see it. 
I wonder what the other team 
is planning. 
MITCHELL: 
 I'm sure they're talking about 
alliances and everything else. 
Do you think they'd 
 be talking about that, 
that early in the game? 
MITCHELL: 
 I don't know. 
KEL: 
So, we have 
nothing in here. 
MITCHELL: 
 Do you see anybody
as the weakest yet? 
Everybody has some very 
 strong strengths. 
I mean, have you 
thought about that? 
I mean, obviously you have, 
 to ask it. 
Well, I think 
 we all have; 
it's kind of inevitable. 
In a few days, we're going 
 to have to. 
Right? 
KEL: 
 You don't ever learn 
 anything by talking. 
You learn things by listening. 
And, right now, 
 I'm listening to them. 
I'm learning about them. 
Tell me who you think 
 is the weakest, then. 
I don't know. 
Maralyn is probably
 the weakest. 
Part of me thinks 
 to maybe even go 
for the most threatening too, 
 you know? 
I'm trying to decide 
 which way to go. 
KEL: 
 I think Jerri and Mitch 
 would look at me 
as someone they would vote off 
 because I would be potentially 
dangerous to them because I'm 
mentally and physically strong. 
We're good. 
 We can head back. 
JEFF: 
 Voting strategy wasn't the only
 thing on the Survivors' minds. 
Fire quickly became a priority 
 for both tribes. 
KIMMI: 
I'm angry! 
Angry, angry, angry,
 angry, angry, angry!
DEBB: 
Man! You're generating 
some sparks! 
KIMMI: 
 We tried every way 
 to get this fire going. 
And yes, 
 I was smashing the rock. 
And, you know, but I made it 
 into an energy release, 
because you just can't say 
 to people you're a jerk-off, 
shut up, so you focus 
 your energy somewhere else, 
and you're fine. 
Fire. 
( Jerri whooping ) 
( Jerri squealing ) 
JERRI: 
Oh, my God! Look out! 
JEFF: 
 Despite their efforts, 
neither tribe succeeded 
in generating more 
 than a few sparks 
and a little smoke. 
MARALYN: 
 Until we can get a 
 fire and boil water, 
we're not going to be 
 eating much of anything. 
JEFF: 
 But luck was about to change 
for one tribe. 
The first challenge 
 brought the hope of fire 
and immunity. 
Waterproof matches. 
One of the things we're playing 
for tonight, right here. 
We're also playing 
for something else-- 
the immunity idol. 
It was Ogakor who had 
 the first taste of victory. 
Your reward: 
 waterproof matches. 
( cheering ) 
And that night, 
 they had their first taste 
of hot food, as well. 
KEITH: 
 Okay, guys, 
one vegetable paella coming up. 
JEFF: 
 But professional chef Keith 
didn't quite live up 
 to his credentials. 
AMBER: 
I was pretty surprised the 
 first time I tasted the rice. 
I was really looking forward 
to a warm meal. 
And the first bite was nothing 
 like I imagined. 
I'm not complaining,
I'm not complaining, 
 I promise, but... 
It's hard to eat. 
JERRI: 
 The first time 
 Keith made rice, 
the rice 
 was way undercooked. 
I hate to say it, 
but it wasn't really very good. 
COLBY: 
 I don't think the first batch 
 of rice went over real well. 
In fact, I think it 
went over like a pickle 
 in a punchbowl. 
Anyone want seconds? 
JEFF: 
 On Day 3, 
the torches were lit 
 for the first Tribal Council. 
For Kucha, there was 
 little question 
about who should be the first 
 person voted out of the tribe. 
She's very set in her ways, 
she doesn't like 
 to be second-guessed, 
and it makes it very hard 
 for us to deal with her 
in any kind of group dynamic. 
At this point, I think 
that Rodger would probably 
 be the smarter vote, 
but I think that 
 the group dynamics 
and people fitting in well 
 together is important, 
and Debb is definitely on the 
 outside with certain people. 
She just chooses 
 to be independent, 
and she's just 
 a strong-willed person. 
It's not a bad thing, 
it's just not what I need. 
First person voted out 
 of the tribe... 
is Debb. 
The tribe has spoken. 
It's a reward. 
Oh, my God. 
"A leap of faith is 
 not for the skilled,
"Just step off the edge,
BOTH: 
 try not to get killed." 
JEFF: 
 With Day 4 came the 
 first reward challenge-- 
one that gave Rodger 
 something to worry about. 
RODGER: 
 Today's challenge 
is probably going to be 
 jumping off a cliff 
into some water. 
 I just basically 
learned to swim 
 right before we came out here. 
Plus I just 
 never did like heights. 
( whooping ) 
( yelling ) 
Come on, Rodger! 
 Let's go, baby! 
JEFF: 
 Though Rodger 
 gave his all, 
it wasn't enough to secure 
 a Kucha victory. 
Ogakor crossed the finish line 
 first, and walked away 
with two warm blankets 
as their reward. 
RODGER: 
 For five quarts of beans, 
I'd have jumped 
 off there again. 
I think. 
Well, after we came back 
 from the award challenge, 
it's right down 
 the river here a ways, 
there's a rapids 
 running through there. 
Hey, guys, 
everybody in the hot tub! 
ALICIA: 
 We have a rock bed 
 with all this water, 
just, like, cascades down. 
 It's like a little waterfall. 
Like little white rapids. 
We all, like, ran and got in. 
It's just like a Jacuzzi, 
 and it's become Kucha Jacuzzi. 
ELISABETH: 
 It just felt so 
 good on our muscles, 
and I think 
 for the first time, 
all the workaholics 
 in our group 
took, like, ten minutes 
to just think about the fact 
that we jumped off a cliff! 
Rodger! 
ALICIA: 
 Rodger, come on.
We got a Jacuzzi 
 going over here! 
Work your way 
over there. 
Oh, man, that's... 
 Whoo, that's cold! 
But it feels good. 
KIMMI: 
 I think that our morale is 
more positive to see 
 that Kentucky Joe 
was able to take the swan dive 
 off the cliff and be, like, 
"You know what, 
 I might not be the best at it, 
"but you know what, 
I'm not going to let 
 my team down." 
And that is just like a greater
 triumph than two blankets. 
Hold on. I'm losing 
 my trunks here! 
I'm losing my trunks! 
JEFF V.: 
Now, who would have 
thought Rodger 
would be the 
first one naked?! 
I'll just sit here. 
MICHAEL: 
 There's that fine line 
 between the physical weak link 
and one of the strongest 
 morale builders. 
You know, we all kind of 
you know, 
 gather around him 
for that father-figure 
 type of thing, 
so I'm just trying 
 to decide how important 
that's going to be 
 to my ultimate survival. 
Whoo! I could sleep 
 down here tonight. 
I know. 
RODGER: 
 As far as what they've been 
 calling me-- Kentucky Joe-- 
yes, I've been kind 
 of playing along with that. 
I'm kind of playing 
the old dumb farm boy, 
schoolteacher, dirt poor, 
and maybe I've been playing 
 the Kentucky Joe part 
a little bit too much. 
And maybe I need to come out 
 a little bit more. 
I didn't want the others 
 to have the impression 
that I'm ready to leave, 
 'cause I am not. 
I'm here for the duration, 
 if that works out. 
JEFF: 
 On Day 5, a storm 
 brewed at Ogakor 
in the form of a blue bikini. 
First, Jerri muscled in 
 on Keith's cooking duties. 
There's a bunch more things 
we can have than rice, 
 and I'm ready 
to start making some of them. 
KEITH: 
 She wants to cook 
 some tortillas for breakfast. 
I think it's fantastic. 
Actually, it's a break for me, 
 you know? 
No worries, mate. 
JEFF: 
 Then she accused Kel 
 of smuggling beef jerky. 
JERRI: 
 And I saw him put something 
 in his mouth, 
and it was, like, 
 dark-brown colored. 
I believe her, actually. 
JERRI: 
 To think that someone 
 in our own tribe 
would be sneaking in 
extra stuff, 
 especially food.
While Kel was up 
 on the hill, 
they rifled through his bag. 
TINA: 
 There wasn't anything 
 in there at all, 
but all I was thinking about: 
 if I find beef jerky in here, 
it's going to be ugly. 
How you guys doing? 
You guys were talking 
 about that you thought 
I was eating
 beef jerky. 
It was a blade of grass.
And I smushed it up 
 into my jaw, and 
I was chewing on that. 
I was just 
 chewing grass. 
Nobody had any right 
 to go into Kel's bag. 
It would be very big of us 
to apologize. 
No. 
Okay. 
MARALYN: 
 Gee, whiz, 
things are heating up 
 at our encampment. 
Okay. 
Oh, my butt!
Watch it there. 
Careful... 
Really? Whoa! 
KEL: 
 I only learned that they 
 went through my stuff 
after Keith told me. 
We took a boat ride, 
 and he said, 
"Hey, you know what? 
Those guys went through 
 your stuff 
to check to see 
 if they could find 
this magical beef jerky. 
And it's not there in my stuff. 
I mean, it's not there 
because I didn't bring it. 
If somebody has something 
 to say about me, 
they should have had the guts, 
 you know, to be able 
to come face... to be 
 face-to-face with me and say, 
"What's that in your mouth?" 
you know? 
Our bags had
 been checked
before we got out here. 
I mean, 
there's no way I could 
have had beef jerky 
after I was swimming 
 in the water 
or on my gear or anything, 
 or have it out here. 
KEITH: 
Any type of relationship, 
you have... 
stress points. 
I've already had mine 
with Jerri. 
These individuals here 
aren't trying 
to cohabitate for life. 
 KEL: 
 Sure. 
They're trying to cohabitate 
 for a million dollars. 
KEL: 
 I don't disagree
with you on the fact that 
I want to win every day. 
Absolutely.
I want to win all 
 the competitions. 
I have no problem with that. 
But you have 
 to understand that... 
you know, I'm a captain 
 in the U.S. Army, 
and for them to question 
 my integrity 
over a piece of beef jerky... 
Can I finish, please? 
KEITH: 
Sure. 
...over-over a piece 
of beef jerky means a lot to me.
As you've noticed in
 the last few days, 
I'm a good person, 
but I'm also very simple, 
and I don't do a lot of talking.
I'm not the life of the party. 
Maybe it bothers
 you guys 
that I'm, um, not as talkative 
 as you guys are, 
and-and maybe that... rubs 
 you guys the wrong way. 
Kel, they got caught up 
in this beef jerky frenzy, 
and nobody had any... 
 nobody had any right 
to go through 
 your bag. 
Your attitude 
 about all of that was, uh... 
incredibly controlled, 
because if it had been me, 
hey, I probably would have torn 
 the whole camp down! 
Somebody went through my bag? 
 Hello! 
Everybody on 
 this whole team
considers you a valuable part 
 of the team. 
Oh, that is very true. 
Big asset. 
 And we just
don't want this to, uh, rub you 
 the wrong way. 
Well, look, it doesn't 
rub me the wrong way, 
because I don't get upset 
very easily, 
and I can't even remember 
the last time 
I've ever gotten angry. 
I mean... 
I just don't get angry, 
and I found this more comical 
than anything. 
I was just... I was going, 
"Who are these people? 
"Why are they... where do 
they... where do they come from 
"that they just think 
that this captain is going 
to jeopardize his career 
 over a piece of beef jerky?" 
Either they don't like me, 
 which is quite possible, 
or they want to sabotage 
 my character 
as a way of making me someone 
that's not desirable 
 for an alliance. 
And that's too bad if they're 
playing the game that way, 
'cause I'm not going to play 
 the game that way. 
I'm not going to play it dirty, 
and I'm not going to bring 
 this issue up to them, 
because it's just going 
 to develop more confrontation. 
But it does bother me but, um, 
 the main aspect right now 
is to develop a solid team. 
NICK: 
 "The next challenge 
 may go too far. 
"Just say, 'Rub-a-dub-dub,' 
"thank God for the 
 grub, close your eyes,
plug your nose 
 and swallow hard."
We're eating. 
 We're eating bugs! 
NICK: 
 We're eating
 something. 
JEFF: 
 On Day 6, Kimmi felt 
the pressure of the second 
immunity challenge. 
( loud retching ) 
Let me go last. 
I'm a vegetarian, 
which means I don't eat 
 land-dwelling animals. 
I'm not eating amphibian. 
I'm not eating reptile. 
I'm not eating mammal. 
 I'm not eating fowl. 
JEFF: 
 But in a tie-breaker, 
she pulled through 
 by swallowing 
a mangrove worm, 
securing Kucha's 
 first immunity victory. 
( Kucha cheering ) 
At Ogakor's 
 first Tribal Council, 
Kel couldn't overcome 
 the stigma 
of being the loner and accused 
 beef jerky smuggler. 
The army captain was deserted 
 by his tribe. 
You made it too easy to cast 
this vote too early in the game.
The only comfort I have 
 in voting this way 
is the fact that you brought 
 this on all by yourself. 
I know you're probably 
 a good military person, 
but you're the person 
who least likely tried 
 to fit into our tribe. 
If you were lying 
 in the Simpson Desert, 
dying of thirst, 
 every single one 
of us would give you 
a drink of water. 
Thanks for playing. 
We have some nice parting gifts 
 for you. 
The tribe has spoken. 
JERRI: 
 ? I've been a bad, bad girl ? 
? I've been careless ? 
? With a delicate man ? 
? And it's a sad, sad world ? 
? When a girl will break a boy ?
? Just because she can ? 
? Heaven help me 
 for the way I am ? 
? Save me 
 from these evil deeds ? 
? Before I get them done ? 
? And I need to be redeemed ? 
? To the one I sinned against ? 
? 'Cause he's all I ever knew 
 of love. ? 
( applause ) 
TINA: 
Fiona Apple's hard to sing. 
Yeah, she's very hard 
to sing. 
JERRI: 
 You think so? 
It's totally my key.
JEFF: 
 By Day 7, 
Mike was becoming more restless
about the food situation. 
MICHAEL: 
 I think people are 
still recovering 
 from the coldness of the night,
but, uh, I kind of wish 
that everybody would take 
 advantage of the, uh, 
early morning fishing, 
'cause I think we could get 
 a lot of fish. 
We were going to have 
 seven poles 
in the water this morning. 
Maybe they're just relying 
 on me to bring in the fish. 
I do know that bringing home 
 food does secure me longevity 
in the tribe, which is 
an equal, uh, incentive 
to go out getting fish 
 as my yearning for food. 
So it's double. 
MARALYN: 
 ? When I'm on the street 
 where you live ? 
? I have often walked... ? 
JEFF: 
 By Day 8, 
Maralyn was feeling secure 
 with at least one 
of her friendships. 
MARALYN: 
 Tina is a fabulous woman. 
She is a star. 
I trust Tina the most. 
TINA: 
 Maralyn and I have bonded 
more so than I have 
with any of the other people. 
It might be our ages. 
Go! 
But at the immunity challenge, 
it was Maralyn's stumblings 
that robbed Ogakor 
 of a victory... 
Kucha! 
JEFF: 
 ...sending them back 
to Tribal Council, 
where Maralyn again asserted 
 her bond with Tina. 
I'm conjoined 
with Tina. 
JEFF: 
 But she learned 
the hard way that, 
 at least in this game, 
friendships aren't always worth
 a million dollars. 
Mad Dog, I love you. 
I value your friendship 
 more than anything. 
This vote has everything to do 
 with the promise I made; 
has nothing to do with you. 
I hope you'll understand. 
It kills me to do this to you. 
It was difficult 
 to watch you get 
all scraped up 
 in those challenges. 
Fireside concerts will not be 
the same without you. 
The last nine days have 
really taken their toll on you, 
both physically and emotionally.
The tribe has spoken. 
It's time for you to go. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
JEFF: 
 On Day 10, Mike continued 
 to obsess over fish... 
every last bit of them. 
Livers and kidneys. 
 These are hearts. 
And these are... I'm not sure 
what the dark purple things are.
Those are probably the pancreas 
 or something. 
I don't know. And this is... 
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it was just in one of them. 
I scaled these puppies, too. 
We're having fish skins today. 
These are the fish eggs. 
I ate the stomach, 
and I ate the heart, 
the liver, and, uh, 
I think the
 pancreas. 
And... 
 He's crazy.
Um, these are 
just the leftover... 
 At least he's 
 cooking it now.
the leftover... 
At least I'm cooking it now. 
ALICIA: 
 He used to 
 eat it raw.
And we had eyeballs 
last night... 
or two nights ago. 
Mike eats fish guts, 
but Mike eats things 
 that just aren't necessary. 
Why eat a fish eyeball? 
It has zero nutritional value, 
 as far as I know. 
MICHAEL: 
The only part 
of the fish 
that we haven't eaten 
at this point 
is the actual outer core 
 of the head-- the skull. 
KIMMI: 
 Let me just clear that up. 
Mike eats 
 just about everything. 
Mike ate the eyeballs, 
Mike ate the pancreas, 
 the liver, the kidney, 
the intestine, the stomach. 
I like 
the intestines, but... 
Not all of us are eating that. 
He's the only one 
 that ate eyeballs. 
JEFF: 
 And when Mike went out 
to catch more fish, 
 Jeff got annoyed. 
JEFF V.: 
 Mike bumped me out 
 of the boat to go fishing. 
It wasn't right, and I wanted 
to go off on him 
 right then and there. 
But then I thought, no. 
How can I use this situation 
 to my advantage 
in garnishing respect 
 from the tribe? 
Which is exactly what I did. 
Jeff? 
I'll take you 
fishing later. 
It's okay. 
KIMMI: 
So, you didn't 
say anything? 
No. I don't care. 
KIMMI: 
All right. 
If they can catch fish, 
 they can catch them. 
ALICIA: 
 Everybody should
 get a turn. 
This is not 
 "first person 
awake gets in the boat."
Wake somebody up and 
 say, "I'm going fishing.
Did you want to come?" 
That's so easy to do. 
If Jeff said no, 
then it's on him. 
But, no, right away, 
 the decision is made. 
Mike is up, 
he's going. 
And they just got in the boat 
and left. 
That cannot happen. 
It just can't happen. 
Say something to him, then. 
This is, 
this is a group, people. 
I will say something. 
'Cause things have to be fair, 
 you know? 
It can't be
 like that. 
JEFF V.: 
 Alicia was, like, "Well, fine. 
If he wants to do it that way, 
 we're voting him out." 
There it is 
on a silver platter-- conflict.
I'm in the middle of it, 
but it doesn't look 
 like I'm in the middle of it. 
That's the way I hope things 
 sort of play out. 
( animals and birds chittering )
JEFF: 
 On Day 10, 
 Kucha was back in action. 
They won three chickens 
and a rooster 
 at the reward challenge... 
( indistinct chatter ) 
( cheering ) 
JEFF: 
 ...much to Kimmi's dismay. 
KIMMI: 
Wait, don't break 
her wings off! 
RODGER: 
 We ain't gonna hurt her.
Who's next?
KIMMI: 
Can't they give us 
some edamame, 
some tofu? 
 ( laughing ) 
JEFF: 
 And just when Kucha 
seemed to have it all, 
Michael made good 
 on his promise 
to bring in more food. 
On Day 11, 
he killed a wild pig. 
( pig squeals ) 
JEFF V: 
 Mike killed a pig, 
and there's going to be
a lot of ham and
 bacon and pork 
coming up in here.
What is wrong with you people?! 
This is sick. 
I live in a sick tribe. 
Ooh.
ALICIA: 
It's good, right? 
Mmm. 
Whoa. 
 We're going to get strong now. 
JEFF: 
 That night at Ogakor, 
there was no banquet-- 
 just more rice. 
Damn, that was good. 
TINA: 
 Should we play 
 our game now 
before everybody gets sleepy? 
JEFF: 
 With morale low, 
they decided to try 
 something new. 
MITCHELL: 
 After supper, Tina-- 
she started the idea that 
 since we were all feeling down,
since we were all having 
a negative attitude 
 toward each other, 
that we should, uh, go around 
and say good things 
 about each other. 
Say positive things. 
KEITH:
 Jerri.
Jerri, Jerri, 
 Jerri, Jerri. 
Well, we've had our differences.
And we probably always will. 
But from get-go, it was
 rough, it was rough. 
And, uh, 
 rightfully so.
I mean, we're thrown into 
 something to play a game. 
But in a different place 
 and a different time, 
it would be much different. 
Thanks, Keith. 
TINA: 
Very honest, Keith. 
JERRI: 
We still have Keith 
to go here, all right? 
Yup, that's right.
JERRI: 
I'm going 
to go first. 
It's-It's hard, 
because 
I can be a little bit 
 of a control freak. 
And I know that. 
But, I'm... 
I mean, I... 
If I in any way 
have... 
hurt your feelings, or... 
any of that, 
I'm truly sorry. 
I don't have a problem 
 saying I'm sorry. 
That was something 
 I just felt I wanted to do. 
'Cause if I, I didn't want 
 to hurt anybody's feelings, 
I didn't want to step 
 on anybody's toes. 
And I felt such a great sense 
 of relief after that. 
Well, I-I definitely 
 feel better 
expressing this, 
'cause holding it in 
just sucks. 
( chuckling ): 
 It really does. 
KEITH: 
 Her apologizing to me 
 was just enormous, 
and, uh, we were able 
 to wipe the slate clean. 
I'm very glad that I've gotten 
 to know you, Keith, 
and I... you know what? 
Someday, I-I really want 
 to taste your cooking. 
Man, you know it, 
 and you're going to, 
if I got to shove it 
 down your throat... 
JERRI: 
No, you 
won't have to. 
KEITH: 
 ...piece by piece,
I'm going to 
 feed it to you.
Jerri, I'm real impressed 
 with you saying, 
you know, 
 saying that you were sorry. 
Sorry is a very hard word 
 to say. 
Jerri was on my last nerve, 
and just her expressing 
 to the tribe 
I know I have these 
 controlling issues 
made all the difference 
 in the world to me. 
Well, don't we all feel 
better after this? 
ALL: 
 Yeah. 
I do. 
I like this game. 
JEFF: 
 On Day 12, Kucha 
 continued their hot streak 
by winning 
 another immunity challenge. 
"C" is right. 
Kucha wins. 
 ( cheering ) 
So, Ogakor 
 went back to Tribal Council 
for the third consecutive time.
And though there was a plan 
 to oust Keith, 
it was Mitchell 
 who was taken by surprise 
when some members 
changed their strategy 
 at the last minute. 
Man, you know 
this is nothing personal. 
But I'm here to win. 
Let the games begin. 
And when I get to New York, 
I'm buying the champagne 
 for dinner, buddy. 
You add some tension 
 to the group at times, 
and my hope is that 
 by eliminating you, 
we eliminate a little bit 
 of that friction. 
Two days ago, this would 
 have been much easier 
than it is right now. 
I'm very glad 
 we buried the hatchet. 
JEFF: 
 Two rounds of voting 
resulted in a tie 
 between Keith and Mitchell. 
In the Survivor rules, in a 
deadlock, you go to votes cast 
in previous Tribal Councils. 
Tribe member 
with the most votes 
is the person 
voted out. 
How many votes 
have you had 
 cast against you, Keith? 
None. 
Mitchell? 
One. 
One vote is the difference. 
The tribe has spoken. 
Having lost 
 three members in a row, 
Ogakor was in 
 a downward spiral. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
Things didn't get any better 
on Day 13. 
Friction developed 
 between Colby and Jerri 
when they had to build 
 a stretcher 
for the reward challenge. 
I think it's great.
I'm saying instead of 
 starting it over the top, 
start it underneath.
From underneath. 
 See what I'm saying?
No, I don't see 
what you're saying. 
God bless America. This... 
JERRI: 
Does Colby seem 
like he's in 
kind of a bad mood? 
AMBER: 
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. 
Oh, my God. 
AMBER: 
I don't know 
if one of us said something. 
I mean, I said something. 
I don't know. 
Dudes are weird. 
( laughing softly ) 
I mean, he did seem 
 pretty stressed. 
Maybe he's just, 
 like, you know, 
I just want to be by myself 
for a little bit. 
We have no reason 
 to be stressed. 
We built an 
 awesome stretcher.
And I want to help
make him feel better, if I can. 
This whole thing 
 is stressful enough 
without adding more stress. 
JEFF: 
 For the fourth time in a row, 
Kucha came through 
 with another victory. 
( cheering ) 
And Ogakor reached a new low. 
I'm so tired of losing. 
Don't let them 
 break your spirit.
JEFF: 
 Although Kucha 
was a well-oiled machine 
at the challenges, 
there was hostility 
 back at camp. 
Alicia and Kimmi clashed 
 over the chickens. 
KIMMI: 
What the hell 
is up your butt? 
Do not yell at me 
 about the chickens.
I am not getting... 
 But don't jump 
all over me,
 sweetheart! 
Don't wave your finger 
in my face and mumble 
under your breath. 
I will always wave my finger... 
You want me to say
 it to your face? 
Yes, say it to my face. 
 Yes, I will be happy to.
I'm saying it to 
 your face right now!
Thank you! 
I'm tired of you 
and the ( bleep ) chicken! 
AMBER: 
 "Just keep your wits, 
"and you'll make it with ease. 
"The prize is the idol, 
and that's much better 
 than cheese." 
JEFF: 
 When the note arrived 
for the next 
 immunity challenge, 
Ogakor decided to take charge 
 of their desperate situation. 
COLBY: 
 It is going to take 
every ounce of-of keenness, 
 of smarts, of strength, 
of everything we have. 
The excuses are done. 
Check them at the door, 
and let's-let's 
 get down to business. 
It is going to be 
one hell of a show today, 
and it's, uh, 
you know, I think we're as ready
as we're going to be. 
Come on! 
( indistinct chatter ) 
JEFF: 
 The pep talk worked. 
Ogakor made a sterling comeback
 at the maze challenge. 
Yeah! 
Come on, go, go, hurry up! 
( screaming ) 
AMBER: 
Oh, yes! Whoo! 
( thunder crashing ) 
JEFF: 
 Kucha was finally forced 
to return to Tribal Council. 
She and I have not got along 
 from the beginning. 
The whole food thing 
 is really becoming an issue. 
It separates her 
 from the rest of the tribe. 
This could be a nasty game, 
but you have to play with class.
For a strong Kucha, 
 it's the best vote. 
You're a great girl, 
and I look forward 
 to the banana split 
on the other side with you. 
The tribe, 
and Mother Nature, 
has spoken. 
Kimmi took the fall 
 for the disharmony 
at Camp Kucha. 
With the merge 
 of the two tribes 
now just around the corner, 
Kucha still had 
 a one-member advantage 
over Ogakor, 
 the importance of which 
was not lost 
 on the tribe mates. 
NICK: 
 We're really hoping 
to go into the merger 
 six to four, and that way, 
we could just basically 
 pick them off one by one. 
JEFF: 
 But before the next 
 immunity challenge 
could take place, 
 tragedy struck the Kucha Tribe.
( Michael screaming ) 
ELISABETH: 
Get in the water. 
You okay? 
( agonized groan ) 
ELISABETH: 
Oh, my God! 
He's burned; 
 he's burned pretty bad, Teri. 
Here's some water. 
 Give him water. 
JEFF: 
 Michael passed out 
 and fell into the fire, 
severely burning his hands. 
NICK: 
 Stay in the water,
 stay in the water.
Do you want me 
to come in with you, Mike, 
and swim with you?
Look at these things. 
Oh! 
Oh, Mike. 
Keep your hands
 in the water. 
NICK: 
Oh, my God. 
I'll have you lie down 
there, Mike. 
We're gonna get you home. 
( screaming ) 
See you, Mike.
Hang in there, buddy. 
MICHAEL: 
I love you guys. 
You guys do what's right. 
You guys know what to do. 
JEFF: 
 His evacuation 
 left Kucha and Ogakor 
with five members each. 
The field 
 had unexpectedly been leveled 
for the upcoming merge. 
On Day 19, 
 the merge was put into motion 
when tree mail arrived 
for the two tribes. 
"Boys' night out. 
"You've wondered 
for weeks 
"what's their 
 camp like. 
"So, here's your big chance. 
"Send your scouts for the hike. 
"The men will go visit 
while the women remain. 
"Cook a big dinner. 
There'll be guests 
to entertain." 
So, we'll stay here. 
The guys are going 
 to come to our camp. 
We'll cook dinner for them. 
They're going to cook dinner 
 for you guys. 
I better iron a shirt!
( laughing )
Oh! 
BOTH: 
 "Girls night out. 
"The women will go 
"visit while the fellas remain. 
"Cook a big dinner. 
"There will be guests 
to entertain." 
JEFF V.: 
 So you guys are going 
over there, 
 and those girls
are coming over here. 
They're keeping 
 the chicks apart. 
JEFF: 
 The survivors believed 
they were sending scouts 
to assess the livability 
 of each other's camps 
and decide on a home 
 for their new tribe. 
Fee, fi, fo, fum. 
I smell the blood 
 of a Kucha Tribe. 
What's up? 
Hey. 
 Hi. 
JEFF: 
 But Ogakor was expecting 
 the men of Kucha. 
ALICIA: 
 Can I tell you how
 funny this is? 
The guys are expecting 
you guys. 
 Yeah. 
No! 
We have... 
We have all the... 
Anybody home? 
JEFF: 
 And Kucha was expecting 
 the women of Ogakor. 
What? 
 What's up, 
 fellas? 
How you doing, Nick? 
 Good. 
So, your note said what, 
boys night out? 
KEITH & COLBY: 
Boys night out. 
JEFF V.: 
Ours said girls night out. 
RODGER: 
Ours said 
girls night out. 
We were expecting 
 the women over here.
COLBY: 
Rodger, 
I'm real sorry, bro. 
I didn't even bring a skirt 
 with me, so I can't 
do anything for ya. 
( laughing ) 
JEFF: 
 During the visit, Jeff felt 
 there were too many cooks 
in Kucha's kitchen. 
KEITH: 
...Roasted. 
You pop 'em right out. 
They'll eat like candy. 
It's like the tenderloin 
of chicken. 
JEFF V.: 
 We knew Keith had brought 
 some type of big pan 
for his luxury item, 
 and we knew that 
he was somewhat 
of an arrogant little whatever, 
and so he comes over 
 and he immediately starts 
futzing with the pan. 
You want things
 to boil over. 
You do? 
 Yup. 
JEFF V.: 
 You know, 
 it's what we expected. 
I just hate Alicia's not here, 
 because 
I think 
 he probably annoyed her most. 
( laughs ) 
JEFF: 
 Back at Ogakor, 
the girls fantasized 
 about food. 
Hot fudge. 
I'm, like, 
 craving a hot dog and... 
Cashews and pistachios. 
ELISABETH: 
 We're torturing ourselves. 
We are absolutely 
 torturing ourselves. 
Have you ever had different 
flavor Tootsie Rolls, 
like cherry Tootsie Rolls 
and...? 
JERRI: 
 Yes! 
And vanilla. 
Vanilla? 
ALICIA: 
They are yummy. 
JEFF: 
 On Day 20, 
 everyone agreed-- 
Kucha camp was the place 
 to live. 
JERRI: 
 They have a kitchen. 
They have all these 
wonderful things. 
I am so stoked 
about going to their camp. 
We've got mail! 
Whoo! 
 JEFF: 
 But the survivors were thrown 
for a loop when a tree mail 
 note told them to start 
from scratch on a new beach. 
ELISABETH: 
 Anxious. 
"You have just 15 minutes 
"to get all your work done. 
"Hike back 
to the crock swim. 
"The map shows you the way. 
Take all that you can, 
 but the canoe's got to stay." 
Oh! 
We were ready to pack up 
 and move to Camp Kucha. 
Roll up the 
 flag inside.
And when we looked at the map, 
it was a completely 
 different spot. 
Maybe they're doing
 the same thing, 
and we're gonna 
 have a whole new camp.
Yup, I think 
 that's what it is. 
New place. 
Damn it! 
Things are never 
 easy around here. 
We were a little angry 
 about it. 
Six minutes. 
KEITH: 
 I was really frustrated 
 with it. 
I just didn't want 
 to leave there. 
Just... You know, we were there,
we were comfortable. 
 It was a real pain. 
Let's go. 
JEFF: 
 The ten remaining 
survivors reunited and named 
their new tribe Barramundi. 
They then toasted their merge.
ALL: 
 Yay! 
( cheering ) 
ALICIA: 
 You know, it was really 
 kind of interesting, 
because in the middle 
 of all this celebrating, 
this game is still 
 being played. 
Every minute of every day. 
JEFF: 
 Alicia was right. 
The first immunity challenge 
 for Barramundi proved, 
old tribes die hard. 
After lasting ten hours 
 in an endurance contest, 
Keith, who had prior votes 
 stacked against him, 
asked Tina 
 to let him have immunity. 
Hey, Tina? 
Hey, what? 
I need this. 
TINA: 
 I looked over at Keith, 
and Keith said, 
 "Tina, I need this one." 
He must have really thought 
that he was gonna get the votes
 cast against him. 
It's the hardest thing 
I've ever done to come in. 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
 With the immunity talisman 
 around his neck, 
Keith was protected 
 from the voting 
at Tribal Council. 
It was just the advantage 
the old Ogakor tribe needed. 
We learned early on 
 in the game 
that you had one vote 
 against you previously. 
It was a, uh, strategic move 
that was determined 
 the first week we were here. 
JEFF: 
 After another double tie, 
 this time between 
Jeff and Colby, Jeff's vote 
from a previous Tribal Council 
 came back to haunt him. 
Colby, how many votes 
have you had 
cast against you? 
Zero. 
Jeff? 
One that 
 I know of. 
Enough. 
JEFF: 
 Jeff was the first member 
 voted out 
of the Barramundi Tribe. 
Jeff, the tribe has spoken. 
( birds calling ) 
JEFF: 
 By Day 22, 
the remaining members 
 of the old Kucha Tribe decided 
it was time to fight back. 
RODGER: 
You know 
we're just sitting ducks now. 
ALICIA: 
 You know what?
Sitting ducks sitting 
by the fire. 
It's not fun anymore. 
Laying down and 
 talking to everybody
at night is not as much
 fun as it used to be. 
ELISABETH: 
 We're not here to sit back 
 and wait 
for someone to vote you off. 
I just really would love 
to just light a fire 
 under everyone. 
Well, that makes me sick. 
I'm not going to sit here 
and be a sitting duck. 
ELISABETH: 
 If no one else wants 
 to keep playing, I'll do 
whatever it takes to stay 
 out here longest and keep... 
keep Kucha going. 
JEFF: 
 Elisabeth led the fight 
 by taking shots 
at the weak links 
 in the Ogakor alliance. 
ELISABETH: 
 I think there's a crack 
 in their tribe right now. 
Pay attention to
 Jerri and Tina, 
because I think 
 Jerri and Tina have issues. 
I try to stay away from cooking,
so I don't have to be judged. 
Ah! 
ALICIA: 
 Elisabeth, 
although she comes across 
 as a very meek 
and mild kind of person, 
she is a serious competitor, 
 believe me. 
Elisabeth is a force 
 to be reckoned with. 
ALICIA: 
 See, look 
 at them. 
JEFF: 
 Elisabeth's hunch about 
the wavering Ogakor alliance 
wasn't farfetched. Even 
Colby was ready 
 to sever all ties with Jerri. 
Um, have you 
 ever considered
leading Keith and Tina
 to believe that you 
want the three of them 
 to be the final three? Maybe...
COLBY: 
 Oh, they're fully 
convinced that's 
what's gonna happen. 
Oh, they are? 
I mean, they... 
COLBY: 
 I was painted into a corner 
and-and had to lie to her 
to convince her that 
there wasn't anything 
 going on. 
I didn't like the fact 
that I had to lie, but... 
because I was lying to Jerri, 
I didn't lose sleep over it. 
JEFF: 
 On Day 24, 
Keith won his second 
 consecutive immunity challenge,
assuring once again 
he could not be voted out 
 of the tribe. 
Again! 
 ( applause and cheering ) 
Congratulations.
JEFF: 
 But at Tribal Council, 
Elisabeth's efforts 
 to get Jerri voted out 
fell short. 
The fragile Ogakor alliance 
 held. 
Girl, you are strong 
 inside and out, and, uh, 
that's the main reason 
 why I have to vote for you, 
because you're threatening. 
Not only do you intimidate 
 the hell 
out of the women around here, 
 but also the men. 
They are scared to death of you.
This is just strictly 
 part of the game, 
and it's part of our process. 
Final vote... 
JEFF: 
 Alicia was the eighth member 
 to go. 
Alicia, the tribe has spoken. 
JEFF: 
 But she will return 
 as the first member 
of the jury 
 that ultimately decides which 
of the final two tribe members 
 will be the sole survivor. 
The remaining members 
 of Barramundi must now 
carefully consider 
 their voting strategies, 
because old tribal loyalties 
 are now less important 
than the good will 
 of this new jury. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Go! 
The winner 
of the reward challenge 
is flown to an exotic location.
And tribal loyalties start 
 to unravel. 
COLBY: 
 We're talking 
 about a lot 
of money at stake.
No, I understand that, 
I understand that. 
Kucha Tribe's 
 in a great position, 
because we are going 
to sacrifice one 
 of our Ogakor members. 
Whoo! 
BOTH: 
 Get it, get it, get it! 
Get it! It's right there! 
Right there! 
 ALICIA: 
 It's right there. 
Get him, get him. 
 What is it? 
ALICIA: 
 You got him!
 You got him.
KIMMI: 
 What is it? 
 Whoo! What is it? 
ALICIA: 
 Can we eat it? 
 It's a prawn. 
KIMMI: 
 It's a prawn. Yay!
We need a bigger bucket.
We need bigger... 
 We need a pot. 
What do you want me to do? 
Here. 
Take it. 
( Alicia hums nervously, 
 Jeff V. laughs ) 
Oh! 
Oh, no! 
 ALICIA & JEFF V.: 
 No!
