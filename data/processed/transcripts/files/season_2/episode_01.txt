         JEFF PROBST: 
 We're onboard a 38-squadron 
 Caribou DHC-4 military aircraft
on loan from 
 the Royal Australian Air Force.
Normally, these planes 
are used to rescue people 
in dangerous, 
 life-threatening situations. 
Today, however, 
 we have a different mission. 
These 16 Americans 
are about to be abandoned. 
This plane will land 
in the heart of one 
 of the most unforgiving places 
anywhere on earth-- 
 the Australian outback. 
For the next 42 days, they'll 
 be left to fend for themselves,








forced to work together 
 to create a new society 
while battling 
 the elements and each other. 
They must learn to adapt, 
or they'll be voted 
 from the tribe. 
In the end, one will remain 
and will claim 
 the million-dollar prize. 
42 days, 16 people... 
one survivor. 
( retching ) 
As this plane touches down 
on a remote strip of land 
 in the Australian outback, 
these 16 strangers begin 
 the adventure of a lifetime. 
They have never spoken 
 to each other, 
and the rules state 
 they must remain quiet 








until after the plane 
 has landed, dropped them off 
and abandoned them. 
They have been separated 
into two competing tribes: 
 Kucha and Ogakor. 
One crate of supplies 
 awaits each tribe, 
and once the plane 
 has taken off, 
they will have 
 only five minutes 
to salvage whatever 
 they can carry. 
They then face 
 a grueling five-mile hike 
that will take them deep 
into the outback 
 and their new homes 
for the next 42 days. 
All right! 
The Kucha tribe, 
 which will always wear blue, 
consists of Kimmi Kappenberg, 
 a bartender from Long Island; 
Michael Skupin, a father 
and software publisher 
 and distributor 
from White Lake, Michigan; 
Alicia Calaway, a personal 
 trainer from New York City; 
Rodger Bingham, 
 a farmer and school teacher 
from Crittenden, Kentucky; 
Elisabeth Filarski, 
 a footwear designer 
from Newton, Massachusetts; 
Nick Brown, a Harvard law 
 student from San Francisco, 
Debb Eaton, 
 a corrections officer 
from Berlin, New Hampshire; 
and Jeff Varner, 
 an Internet projects manager 
from Greensboro, 
 North Carolina. 
Whoo! 
So cold. 
JEFF: 
 Ogakor tribe, 
 which will always wear green, 
consists of Maralyn Hershey, 
a retired police officer 
 from Wakefield, Virginia; 
Colby Donaldson, 
 an auto customizer 
from Christoval, Texas; 
Amber Brkich, 
 an administrative assistant 
from Beaver, Pennsylvania; 
Mitchell Olson, 
 a singer-songwriter 
from Vermillion, South Dakota; 
Tina Wesson, 
 a mother and personal nurse 
from Knoxville, Tennessee; 
Keith Famie, a chef 
 from West Bloomfield, Michigan;
Jerri Manthey, an aspiring 
 actress from Los Angeles; 
and Kel Gleason, 
 an Army intelligence officer 
from Fort Hood, Texas. 
( cheering ) 
Wait, guys, there's 
 got a be a way to 
 prop it open, I think.
"Welcome 
to the Australian Outback. 
"As of right now, you are 
completely cut off 
 from the outside world." 
"These are the only 
 supplies you'll be given. 
"Choose wisely, since 
 you still have a long 
 way to carry them. 
"Fresh water 
 is essential to
 your survival. 
"Unfortunately, 
"all of the water 
 you will need 
"for the next few days 
"must be taken from your box 
"because the river water 
 must be boiled, 
and you may not be able 
 to make a fire." 
We're Kucha? 
Kucha? 
Ogakor.
 Ogre Kor. 
Ogakor.
We have the map. 
I guess 
 we're starting here. 
Yeah. 
Okay, that's north. 
How much do you need? 
I don't know the names yet. 
In the green 
 hat right here. 
Can you help her get 
one side of this undone? 
Can we pee soon? 
Take every, 
every, everything. 
Come on, guys, 
 we need to go now. 
Grab something,
 all right? 
All right, we'll get it, 
 we'll get it. 
JEFF: 
 The tribes will split up and 
 head in opposite directions. 
Their camps are situated 
 four miles apart 
along the shore 
 of the Herbert River. 
Each beach has a flag 
 and a canoe. 
Finding these sites will be 
 the first unofficial challenge 
for the new survivors. 
 KIMMI: 
 Whoever's got the compass? 
Okay, northeast we have to go? 
NICK: 
 It seems like 
 it's not, 
but, okay...
That's north. 
 That's north
 right now, 
so northeast is, like,
 across back that way. 
That way. 
We're going the wrong way. 
We're going the wrong way. 
ALICIA: 
 When they dropped us off, 
you know, everybody was 
designated a certain thing 
to do, and, uh, 
 they gave Nick the compass. 
For some reason... 
although the compass said 
 one way... 
we kept going the wrong way. 
DEBB: 
 Tell me something--
 he's telling me 
we're moving this way. 
According to the compass, are we
 moving in the right direction? 
ALICIA: 
 Absolutely, all
 the way, baby. 
KIMMI: 
I think we should check, 
like, every... 
All right, then, 
that's where we're going. 
Nick? Nick? 
Stay in the front, Nick, 
 and keep us going north 
to northeast, okay, 
but keep us 
 going north...
There's a... 
 there's a beaten path. 
DEBB: 
What's your name again? 
Mike. 
ALICIA: 
Mike. 
Let's just stop for one second 
and look at the map 
All right, all right. 
and look at the compass. 
All right.
Just to make sure, 
'cause it's a long ways 
to where we're going. 
NICK: 
 Even from the beginning, 
 I was finding, like, 
people were automatically 
 getting on people's nerves. 
Um, yeah, we were walking 
 through the grass, 
and Kimmi was like, 
"I can't stand, uh, Debb." 
See, if we're going 
southwest, 
how are we going to hit 
the dry creek bed? 
KIMMI: 
 Because 
 that's north! 
That's right, 
so we're not going to hit it 
unless we go that way. 
KIMMI: 
 Debb's not even a bad person. 
She means well. 
It's just 
 she's not somebody that, 
in the outside world, 
that I would talk to, because...
she'd make me crazy. 
When you traverse something 
that I could bust my butt on, 
 let me know. 
The hike, uh... 
 it was a little 
intimidating. 
Um, I was afraid, 
"Good grief, what if I get so 
 winded that I can't keep up?" 
Do you see the flag?
Wait a minute,
 hang on. 
You all right, Maralyn? 
That trek let me know 
 that this was for real. 
That was a long trek we had 
 through deep sand 
with a lot of heavy equipment, 
 and I was packing more weight 
than anyone else, 
 so I was really struggling. 
It was a long trip, 
 and that was... 
that fired me up, 
because that is the quickest way
to find out 
 what people are made of. 
( groans ) 
I'm a little tired. 
This rice is very heavy. 
I really want to get there soon.
KEITH: 
 We don't know 
 how far away we are, 
so I'm going to run up this 
and do a little reconnaissance, 
see if we can't find out 
 where we're at. 
I figure if it's really far, 
 we'll drape 
some of our stuff here, 
 and we won't take it. 
If we're not far, then we'll 
 buck up and get it there. 
Yeah, I'm going to keep going. 
We're just going
 to follow the 
 creek bed here, 
and, uh, make 
 sure if it looks 
 like it's getting 
too dark, you turn back 
 and come get us. 
JERRI: 
 Keith actually ran ahead 
to go scout out 
 where the camp was, 
'cause we were all getting 
 pretty tired, 
and the last leg of that walk 
 was really difficult. 
COLBY: 
I wish the snakes would... 
Never let 'em see you sweat. 
( birds chirping ) 
Keith? 
KEITH: 
I'm here. 
Okay, what do you see? 
KEITH: 
 I found it. 
Oh, my God!
 Yay! Let's go!
Whoo! 
( laughing and chattering ) 
( whooping ) 
( cheering ) 
Yeah! 
( grunts ) 
( talking happily ) 
JEFF V.: 
 I'm feeling really weak, 
and, um, on the verge 
 of throwing up 
just ever since I got here. 
It started 
 with the plane flight. 
In the beginning, 
 it was really fun, 
and it was kind of cool 
 and groovy, 
and I was enjoying the ride, 
 and then all of a sudden, 
I just got sort of nauseous, 
 and I kept thinking to myself, 
"I'm not going to get sick. 
 I'm not going to get sick. 
I will not throw up." 
So I sort of went 
 into this little zone 
and breathed, and I don't 
 remember any of it. 
KIMMI: 
 Rodger carried one 
 of the big water jugs. 
Mike had a big water jug. 
Poor Elisabeth had the board 
 on her head, 
and then I had the eight 
bottled waters wrapped 
 around me, 
so the-the four of us 
 kind of got separated 
from the other four when we were
walking to our campground. 
ELISABETH: 
 I mean, everything 
 was heavy to carry. 
You can't discount 
 any of our equipment as easy 
to carry, but some 
 of it was just more awkward. 
And some of the crossings, 
 we had to go, you know, 
down a sharp valley of rocks 
 and up again, and kind of wind 
and balance across a river. 
And it was frustrating, too, 
but with the water jugs and, 
you know, 
 the water canteens, and... 
I mean, 
 that stuff is just awkward. 
KIMMI: 
Oh, I see the flag. 
Oh, my God! 
Welcome to our home. 
( laughing ) 
Right up there. 
KIMMI: 
 When we arrived, 
it was just a moment 
 of ecstasy, 
'cause it's like, "Yes! 
 I've worked this far 
just to see this silly thing." 
 I mean... 
And not just physically 
 from here, 
but just mentally preparing 
 yourself for the whole journey,
like, all the airplane flights 
from New York to California 
 to Australia, 
from the other part of 
 Australia to here to there. 
You know, there were just so 
 many things in sequence 
to get you to that flag 
that just being at that flag 
is just an accomplishment. 
( yells ) 
( cheering ) 
( thunder rumbling ) 
We should be up in the trees 
 to some degree. 
There's no shelter here at all. 
ELISABETH: 
 As soon as we got out 
 of the river, 
I think we just... 
 this kind of realization. 
We got a little cold, 
and we realized 
 that we're going to... 
We have to sleep somewhere, 
and we just wanted to feel 
 a little safe and dry. 
So we got to work 
 as much as we could 
on building the basis of a home.
We got enough rocks here, too! 
We could build a pretty decent 
shelter just using rocks! 
( groans ) 
It's going to make it softer 
 to sleep on. 
KIMMI: 
Want to see a what? 
That means there's
 snakes in there. 
When we started building 
 the shelter, 
I thought everybody 
 started chipping in, 
because there was 
 the wood gatherers, 
and there was the people 
that were building, 
 and, uh, I had worked a lot of,
uh, you know, 
 some construction in my life, 
and I-I had a reasonable sense 
 of, uh, of-of construction. 
What we're going to have to do 
is just cut little holes 
 in here, 
and then just tie it 
around the top here 
about this high, so that 
we can just make it right here. 
Um, we need one to go 
 right about halfway 
up along this support 
right here. 
DEBB: 
 It seems like 
one individual 
 in the group is... 
ordering everybody around. 
And if you guys haven't 
 figured it out, it's Mike. 
Rodger, get the level out 
and see how we're doing. 
DEBB: 
 You can't have one person 
 step in 
and start ordering 
 everybody around, 
'cause it's not going to play, 
 and it's not playing right now,
and not just with me, 
 but with others. 
Push that up a little bit, 
 Rodger, so I can... 
Push this up 
 a little bit. 
DEBB: 
 Rodger used to build homes. 
Rodger is the one who helped 
to build this shelter. 
He knows what he's doing. 
Well, Mike comes over 
 and starts telling him 
how to build it, 
and-and Rodger was like, 
 "No, that isn't going to work."
...going to give us fall 
this way plus both directions. 
I mean, do you think
it's enough of a
 pitch here to...
so the rain's going
 to come off good? 
( grunts softly ) 
We're never going 
to want to leave this place. 
I don't know about that.
AMBER: 
I think we're good. 
Yeah, 
we're doing really well. 
KEITH: 
 All right, so, 
what makes the most sense 
as far as building 
where we'd want 
to live? 
Do we want to live 
by the water, or do we 
want to take a walk 
up in the high ground? 
Well, there's a lot 
 of electrical storms. 
AMBER: 
 Yeah, good point. 
KEITH: 
There'll be a lot of bugs 
down by the water though. 
We want to, 
 definitely, be under
some trees, 'cause, I mean... 
when the sun comes out, 
 it's going to be hot. 
Probably the sun
is going to be out
 at certain times, 
so at certain times,
 there's still going 
 to be shade, 
based on the position 
 of the sun. 
KEITH: 
 As soon as we hit the beach, 
it was really kind of amazing. 
Collectively, we all dispersed 
to do something different. 
JERRI: 
 When we got to our camp, 
I was considering at that point 
anything and everything 
 anybody was doing or saying 
as a strategic move. 
MITCHELL: 
 Colby-- his luxury item 
was the Texan flag, 
 which was great, 
because it served 
as the tarp that covers... 
covers us and blocks us 
from the wind and the sun. 
COLBY: 
 I really did bring the flag 
to serve as shelter, 
 but, you know, 
don't get me wrong. 
When I wake up in the morning, 
there's two things 
 I'm thankful for. 
I'm thankful I'm alive, 
 and I'm thankful I'm a Texan. 
JERRI: 
 It's not going to work. 
We don't need 
 to risk ripping this 
if there's a stick 
that's two inches shorter. 
Yeah, you don't need 
to go that far, though. 
No, but it's not
 going to stay 
is what I'm saying. 
The tension 
 between Keith and I... 
I think him and I kind of... 
rubbed each other the wrong way.
Watch, right here, 
watch. 
Let me just show you. 
Right there. 
 It's sticking now. 
That's-that's working. 
And before, it was here. 
But we put it 
 on the grommet
for a reason-- 
so that the flag wouldn't rip. 
You won't be able 
to go through that 
on a flat surface. 
JERRI: 
 Keith and I didn't start off 
 on a very good foot, 
just because of some 
 of the condescending remarks 
he made to me, and he might 
 very well not even be aware 
that he does it, 
 but I'm not the kind of person 
to just let it 
 slide off my back. 
All right, all right. 
MICHAEL: 
You got to share 
something about yourself 
that's really 
embarrassing. 
ALICIA: 
Embarrassing, 
or just deep? 
I just got naked 
in a tent 
with a bunch of strangers. 
RODGER: 
That's what I 
was getting ready to say. 
ALICIA: 
Give us the dirt, girl. 
Like boyfriend,
 husband, wife. 
KIMMI: 
 Okay-- A) not married. 
Don't believe in marriage 
 until I'm 35. 
ALICIA: 
Okay, don't say 
you're a virgin, 
'cause I swear to God, 
I'll... 
I'll tell you 
what my main concern was-- 
where the hell am I going 
 to masturbate out here with... 
( laughter ) 
MICHAEL: 
 You have got to
 be kidding me! 
DEBB: 
 Kimmi is a happy-go-lucky 
 person who's got... 
I-I don't even know 
 how to describe her. 
I don't know 
 what the right word is. 
You know, nothing is taboo 
with her-- nothing at all. 
KIMMI: 
 Listen to me! 
You guys might like a skin wig, 
 however... 
on occasion.
JEFF V.: 
 Kimmi will not shut up. 
You know, I'm tired at night. 
I want to go to sleep, 
 and they're constantly talking.
And with the headache 
 that I have, 
it just reverberates. 
Kimmi cannot say a single thing 
 without screaming it. 
KIMMI: 
All right, someone 
just stuck their finger in my...
DEBB: 
Well, 
it was on my head. 
JEFF: 
 All of a sudden, 
 out of the blue, 
with that accent 
 that just talks 
and talks and talks and talks...
I just want to grab her 
 by the neck 
and shake the... 
 out of her, you know? 
KIMMI: 
Oh, my God, I love you! 
I can take my braids out! 
And you had a threesome. 
We were back to back. 
You farted in my...
 and rebounded it! 
MICHAEL: 
 I think we're starting 
to get to know each other, 
and people are not accustomed 
 to this kind of lifestyle yet. 
I'm a little accustomed 
 to this lifestyle, 
because I do hunt 
 and I do fish and I do camp, 
so it's not that foreign to me. 
Kucha, we got food! 
Oh, my God.
Right, like, 
right under our noses. 
Yeah, I think 
you can eat 'em. 
When I saw those figs, 
 it was a big rush. 
And two or three people 
 came over 
and helped pick the figs, 
and we brought 'em back, 
 and, uh... 
I bit into one 
 right off the tree. 
( spitting ) 
( yelling ) 
Don't...! 
 ( spitting ) 
What? What? What? 
Don't bite into one. 
Dang fruit flies. 
I know.
Well, we're going 
 to put the... 
KIMMI: 
 Can we eat 'em green? 
Look at that. 
DEBB: 
 That's not 
 bugs, is it?
MICHAEL: 
No, that's not bugs. 
I'm looking at bugs. 
DEBB: 
Bugs are all over the place 
here with this. 
Mike, he opens up these figs, 
 and he's... 
showing us these bugs, 
 and I'm just wanting 
to eat that thing so bad 
 'cause I'm starving, 
and these bugs are just creepy, 
 and flying around, 
and I don't eat anyth... 
 you know, I-I cook my food. 
ALICIA: 
If bugs don't fly out, 
I'm going to eat them. 
Speak for yourself, baby. 
DEBB: 
 We very well might 
be cold and hungry tonight, 
but not if we can help it. 
The fire is the most important 
thing for survival. 
We need to eat, 
and we need to boil water. 
That's all I care about. 
If we put enough sand in there, 
 I think it's good. 
MICHAEL: 
Well, the problem is 
we get too much sand in here... 
It's dumping 
on all of our tinder. 
This wood's not going 
to catch fire. 
The tinder's going 
to catch fire. 
But if you keep 
putting sand in there, 
it puts out the tinder. 
DEBB: 
 I know, it's just that 
the book said you 
needed friction. 
KIMMI: 
 Debb works very hard, 
and she means well, 
 but she's like, 
"Well, in the camping book, 
 it says to do it like this." 
And you know what? 
 We could have the wrong wood. 
We could have the wrong rocks, 
 something. 
She's making herself 
 an authority on something 
actively on what she read, 
 and not on actually doing. 
Had she went and practiced 
this stuff at home, 
I would take her opinion a lot 
more, you know, seriously. 
RODGER: 
 One thing we tried to do 
 in starting the fire 
was use my Bible, 
 which I had brought along. 
It was my luxury item. 
And, uh, we tore 
 some pages out of it. 
Uh, it wasn't the pages 
that actually had 
 any scripture in it, 
but I would've used that. 
You know, if you're... 
you got to do with what you got.
Next? 
I don't know. 
RODGER: 
 Yeah. There's a letter 
from my son-in-law he wrote me. 
Read it. 
I don't have 
my glasses. 
Do you want me to read
 it to you out loud...?
I don't care. 
I don't have 
my glasses. 
"Dear Dad, best of luck. 
"You have many people 
 who believe 
"you can do anything 
 you put your mind to. 
"Just be yourself. 
"Things'll be fine in Kentucky. 
"Focus on your task at hand. 
"You can do this. 
"It's not going to be easy, 
"but a challenge such as this 
 shouldn't be easy. 
Just try your best." 
It says, "K.J.A." 
And then he put 
in parentheses "141," 
so I don't know if that... 
RODGER: 
141? 
 Oh! 
ALICIA: 
 That's pretty cool.
You got love notes. 
RODGER: 
 That was a nice 
little piece of home 
when you least, 
least expect it, you know. 
Then it said go to page 200, 
 and then go to page 150, 
and we went through that 
about seven or eight times, 
 I think, till we... 
till we finally came 
 to the end. 
Can you give us the page 
 of the burning bush? 
And it was a little sentimental 
 for me, 
to tell you the truth, 
 to hear it. 
I think you wrote 
the book, huh? 
KEITH: 
 My son is in Cub Scouts. 
If I start this fire, 
 I will be his hero. 
( laughter ) 
Ooh, this side got hot. 
JERRI: 
 Are we far enough away from
 the water to make a fire? 
This is what I was going 
to say, right here. 
Oh, it doesn't... 
I think we start the fire, 
we can take it 
 anywhere we want to. 
We pull off making the fire... 
Well, I don't 
 even really 
want to attempt to start it 
until we get it 
where we want to keep it. 
Yeah. 
 'Cause if we move it, 
 it's going out. 
Well, 
 let me keep trying on this. 
If you get lucky, and 
 you spark that thing, 
and it's ready to 
 go, and you try 
and pick it up 
 and move it, and
 we don't have 
anywhere to put it, then... 
KEITH: 
Then I can just keep it 
burning here 
and a little one going, 
 and we can always move this. 
All right, I'm going to go see 
 if I can find a better place. 
Bad news. 
KEITH: 
 I've never started a fire 
before from scratch, 
 but, you know, 
I knew nightfall was coming. 
We'd have no light, and we'd be 
 able to cook nothing, um... 
and we wouldn't have a bonfire, 
 so it was... 
it was pretty critical. 
COLBY: 
 Keith is just licking 
 his chops. 
He's wanting to cook so bad, 
 he can't stand it, 
and so you can bet 
 he's going to work 
on this fire thing 
 until we lick it. 
AMBER: 
Uh-oh. 
Oh. 
Since Jerri and I had our 
 little confrontation before, 
I thought, you know, 
 this is a great time 
to get her involved 
 with this process, 
to be a part of it somehow, 
with something she brought 
that was important to her. 
Fire. 
Ah! 
Don't come away! 
JERRI: 
Whoo! 
I can feel it. 
JERRI: 
Whoo! 
Oh, my God! 
 Let go. 
Oh, my God!
JERRI: 
Wow. 
Are you guys okay? 
MARALYN: 
 Until we can get a fire 
 and boil water... 
we're not going to be eating 
 much of anything. 
I got the mail... 
No way!
( cheering ) 
All right! Read it. 
 Read it to me. 
Oh, my God.
 All right, 
 what does it say? 
"You expected dry weather, 
"but then you slept in the rain,
"and you can't get a spark 
 no matter how hard you strain. 
"To get your tribe's fire, 
"pay heed to this note: 
 Yes! 
the winners take matches; 
the losers cast the first vote."
Oh!
 Yeah! 
We are getting
 matches! 
When, though? When?
 We are definitely... 
Matches!
 All right, we just got 
 our notice 
for the first 
 immunity challenge, 
and we're going 
 to go kick some butt, 
'cause we're all together 
 on this, 
and we're going 
 to go get us some fire, 
and we're going to go, 
 uh, get us some food. 
Fire means food, so that's 
what we're going to go do. 
We're going to go there, we're 
 going to fight hard and win. 
ELISABETH: 
 Winning immunity is 
 the most important thing. 
We need to... 
beat, beat, beat 
 the other tribe. 
We'll let them eliminate 
 someone on their team first. 
MITCHELL: 
 This immunity challenge 
 is extremely important, 
because we have to show the 
 other team that we're better, 
you know, and plus, 
 we have to have fire 
in order to start eating rice. 
JEFF: 
 What's up, guys? 
Gather up. 
So, uh, anybody have 
any luck with fire? 
No luck. 
 We came close. 
Almost. 
 We got a lot of smoke. 
All right, I got something 
that's going to help the smoke. 
Waterproof matches. 
One of the things 
we're playing for tonight, 
right here, 
a little canister full. 
We're also playing 
for something else 
much more important 
than waterproof matches. 
Right here: 
the immunity idol. 
You want to know this guy 
 really well, 
'cause the tribe that wins 
the immunity idol 
will not have to go 
to Tribal Council 
and vote out 
one of their own members. 
That brings us 
 to challenge number one. 
You're playing for fire. 
You're playing 
for immunity. 
There are four legs 
in the race. 
You'll be carrying 
a lit torch. 
If somebody falls 
in the water at any time 
and their torch goes out, 
your tribe is done. 
Somebody's going home 
tomorrow. 
So that is key. 
Here's how the game 
is played. 
First leg starts 
 at the old bridge. 
You'll make your way across 
using two planks 
 to help you bridge the gaps. 
On the second leg, 
 you'll cross over the island, 
where you'll find, 
 in the water, 
a small torch-carrying raft. 
Put your lighted torch 
 on the raft 
and, as a tribe, swim across 
 to the other side of the bank. 
When you get over there, 
you'll find two sets 
 of wooden rungs. 
Take them with you. 
For the third leg, 
you're going to get 
 on another raft, 
and using a rope, 
 pull yourself across the river.
Using the rungs, climb 
 up the ladder, light the torch.
Winners: 
maybe a hot meal tonight, 
security of knowing 
you're going to be here a while.
Losers: cold, 
somebody's going to be 
the first person 
voted out of the tribe. 
Make sense? 
Let's take our spots. 
 Wait for my start. 
Let's go. 
All right, at stake-- 
fire... and immunity! 
Survivors, ready? 
Ready! 
 Go! 
We won, we won, 
we won! 
Continue to move forward! 
 Move it forward! 
Move it forward! 
Go, go, go! 
You can hand it.
This is a team. 
This is a team. 
Go, go, go, go, 
let's go, let's go. 
NICK: 
Go, go. 
Help her a little. 
Help her. 
Go, go, go. We're even. 
Go, guys, run. 
Go, go, go, go, go, go. 
Get the fire. 
Hand on the raft. 
Let's go. 
Come on, come on! 
We're all done, 
we're all done! 
Let's go, let's go.
Put your hand 
 on the raft, Kel. 
( indistinct shouting ) 
Wait. 
Wait, his foot's caught. 
Oh, my God. 
Watch your step, 
watch your step! 
We're almost there. 
Work, work, work. 
Whoo! Yeah! 
( cheering ) 
Mitchell. 
Go. 
Keep on going. 
Back up, back up. 
Whoo! 
Mitchell! 
TINA: 
 We got it.
ALICIA: 
 We got it. 
Don't lean too far right. 
Good job! 
You got it! 
Good job, Mitchell! 
( cheering ) 
Damn, you're good. 
 Damn, we're good. 
MARALYN: 
 My God! 
Ogakor, congratulations. 
Whoo! 
JEFF: 
Nice work. 
Ow! 
Guys, 
your reward, 
right here: 
waterproof matches. 
Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
And much more important, 
I think, 
you're in possession... 
JERRI:
 Wow...
...of the immunity idol. 
( cheering ) 
We need to stay 
 positive now, okay?
Guys, tomorrow, somebody 
from Kucha will be 
 the first person voted 
out of the tribe. 
You'll have that
to think 
 about tonight.
I know you're already 
 a close group. 
It's going to be 
 a tough decision. 
You guys can head 
 on back to camp. 
Ogakor, you guys 
 can light this up 
 in celebration. 
( birds singing ) 
RODGER: 
 Yesterday's immunity challenge 
 was a big letdown. 
Uh, uh, not only physically, 
 but emotionally. 
I think probably more so 
 emotionally. 
As far as the Tribal Council 
 goes tonight, which are... 
which we have to go to, uh, 
I don't think any of us 
are looking forward to it. 
( gagging ) 
( indistinct chatter ) 
( retching ) 
Jeff is not well. 
ELISABETH: 
You need to sit down. 
You're so shaky, 
you're scaring me. 
I'm okay. 
Please. 
DEBB: 
 I don't know. 
I'm not betting 
 on me getting voted off, 
but I think it's-it's down 
to, like, me, Rodger or 
maybe, um... 
Jeff, because 
 he hasn't been feeling good. 
My personal opinion is 
 the strong survive. 
If you were gonna vote 
for someone, 
who would you be voting for 
right now? 
Jeff. 
Me, too. 
I really love the guy. 
I like... I like...
 He's a good kid. 
But he's sick. 
He's sick. 
JEFF V.: 
Debb. 
 Yeah. 
She wants to go, 
too, by the way. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
She's told me that
 you wanted to go. 
She sure did. 
What? 
She told me that 
 you wanted to go. 
That is a bald-faced lie. 
Okay, scandalous. 
She told me you
 wanted to go. 
DEBB: 
 I-I'm gonna probably 
 vote for Jeff. 
And I was talking 
with him today, you know, 
and he doesn't even seem 
that upset at the thought of it.
Yeah. He... 
He's, like... 
He wants a pizza and a coke. 
 He might have...
ALICIA: 
 She said, "He's falling apart, 
 doesn't feel good." 
I was, like, 
 "Yeah, okay." 
Are you kidding me? 
No, I'm not 
 kidding you.
I wouldn't tell
 you that if she
 didn't say it. 
It's like there's a part of me 
that's a little paranoid 
 about who's talking to who. 
I see these two 
 standing over across, um... 
Mike and Rodger standing 
 across the river talking. 
They're not fishing. 
They're not doing anything. 
They're just talking, and, uh, 
the wheels start turning, 
and I'm just... 
 my eyes are going around. 
I mean, it's two 
different games, you know? 
Me, too.
JEFF V.: 
 Just because we've said what 
 we're doing doesn't necessarily
mean it's gonna happen, 
 and I haven't been 
with these people long enough 
 to know for sure how well... 
I mean, 
 I'm not gonna trust anybody, 
but there's a certain... 
to a certain point, you have to.
I puked on camera.
How embarrassing. 
( laughs ) 
You puked? 
Couple times already... 
Did you save it? 
( laughing ) 
Would you stop?
( indistinct chatter ) 
( bird singing ) 
KIMMI: 
 It's like going to court. 
Tribal Council is going 
 to court. 
Nobody likes to go to court, 
 you know, 
but if you broke the law, 
you got to go, 
 and we broke the law 
by not winning, 
 so we... you know... 
we got 
to go face our punishment. 
Our punishment... 
is to get rid of one of our own.
MICHAEL: 
 The people that I think 
that are in jeopardy 
 tonight are 
potentially Jeff, 
 because of the health issues, 
and Rodger might not be safe. 
He could be 
a liability in the challenges, 
and especially 
 swimming challenges 
and climbing challenges. 
And it's not just Rodger. 
It would be anybody 
 over 50 years old. 
( indistinct chatter ) 
JEFF V.: 
 I mean, I-I'm looking forward 
to voting somebody out, 
'cause it's the game, 
and I'm here to play the game. 
I'm not here to make friends. 
I'm not here for that. 
People have got to go, 
and I look forward 
 to walking up, 
writing somebody's name 
on a card and talking about 'em.
( laughs ) 
Um... 
( laughs ) 
I'm getting ready to do it. 
JEFF: 
Guys, come on in. 
We begin your first 
Tribal Council with a ritual. 
Behind each of you is a torch. 
Grab a torch 
and approach a flame. 
Dip your torches in and... 
get some fire, 
put 'em back in their slots. 
We do this because 
fire does represent life here. 
These torches 
will now represent your life, 
your identity at Tribal Council.
You'll bring these torches 
with you to each Tribal Council,
and the good news is, 
when you return 
home tonight, 
 you will have fire. 
Before we get 
into this, I just want 
you guys 
to take a second 
and look around 
at where we're at. 
We're on top 
 of a granite waterfall. 
Can't think of a more 
 spectacular place 
for the drama that's going 
 to go down here 
every three days. 
This is where you account 
for your actions. 
Some of those actions tonight 
are going to help you. 
Going to stay here 
a few more days. 
Some of those actions may 
come back to haunt you. 
One thing's for certain. 
One of you guys will be 
the first person voted out 
of a tribe. 
So before we get to that, 
let's get a little gauge 
on how the first few days were. 
Debb, what about 
finding the camp? 
Was it a celebration, 
was it fall down, 
 "I'm exhausted"? 
Celebration. 
 Celebration. 
It was celebration 
all the way in. 
Hop in the water 
and then regret it afterwards 
when we were freezing 
 and had no fire. 
Yeah, let's talk 
 a little about that. 
Fire. You've-you've been one 
 really trying 
to get this fire going. 
Yeah, I been the one trying 
 and getting no fire. 
I mean, I've tried everything 
 those damn books said to do. 
The bow, the-the... 
this thing. 
That's crazy. 
Well, you'll have fire tonight 
 when you go home. 
DEBB: 
Yeah, yeah. 
That's good to know. 
It's been a little cold 
 a couple nights here. 
Have you guys formed 
 any impressions 
about the other tribe 
in the limited time 
you've seen them? 
MICHAEL: 
 We haven't really had 
a lot of contact with them, 
but, uh, right now, we totally 
 see them as the enemy. 
We haven't had a chance 
to bond with them. 
We haven't had a chance 
to talk with them at all. 
I didn't even look 
 at 'em when we lost. 
NICK: 
 Yesterday's event was just
a physical challenge, 
and I would've put money on us 
any day to win that challenge, 
but they went through, 
and then we had problems. 
JEFF: 
Rodger, leadership 
come up? 
Did anybody emerge as a leader? 
Uh, yes. 
I would say 
 probably, uh, Mike has. 
Uh, uh, as far as 
 building the hut, 
I think we both probably
 shared in on that, 
'cause my knowledge on that 
 is pretty extensive 
in-in that I teach a carpentry 
 class, and, uh... 
But overall, I'd say he's 
probably taken the lead, 
and-and that's fine,
'cause he's a very 
 knowledgeable person. 
We all... 
we all get along great. 
Tonight is, uh, really 
a hard deal for us. 
Uh, personally, I-I thought 
that the first vote off 
 would be easy, 
because you would probably have 
somebody that would be slacking,
but we just 
haven't had that. 
I mean, every one of these 
people have worked 
and worked hard, 
 and that's-that's 
what makes tonight's 
 vote so hard. 
All right, 
 it's time to vote. 
Here's how 
it's going to work. 
One by one, you guys will go 
 across the bridge 
to the voting confessional. 
You'll write down 
 in big clear letters 
the name of the person 
you're voting for, 
hold it up, 
speak your peace-- 
why you're voting 
the way 
you're voting-- 
then fold it up, 
put it in the voting container, 
come back and have a seat. 
Make sense? 
We'll start here with you, Debb.
You're up. 
I love this guy dearly, 
 but I came here deciding 
that I was going to vote on 
 the strongest surviving. 
Jeff's been the sickest 
of all of us, 
and he's still not over it, 
so I'm going to vote for Jeff, 
 and I hate to do it. 
I love him. 
No real reason, actually. 
She's as hard a worker 
as anybody 
out there, 
and, uh... 
somebody had to go. 
I'm voting for Debb because... 
she's a great worker 
and everything, 
but she does feel isolated. 
You know, when we're together 
all in the tent at night, 
she just chooses... 
to be independent, and... 
she's just 
a strong-willed person. 
It's not a bad thing. 
It's just not what I need. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
I need to remind you that 
 once the votes are tallied, 
the decision is final. 
The person will be 
asked to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
immediately. 
You'll do so across 
 this bridge here. 
Take the bridge up, 
 over the rocks, 
down to a confessional 
where you can speak 
 as long as you want 
about your time here 
in the outback. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote... 
Debb. 
Debb. 
Jeff. 
Debb. 
Four votes for Debb, 
one vote for Jeff. 
First person voted out 
 of the tribe... 
is Debb. 
No point in revealing 
the other two votes. 
You need 
to bring your torch. 
Do good. 
Kick ass. 
JEFF: 
Over here, Debb. 
The tribe has spoken. 
It's time for you to go. 
Good-bye, Debb.
You survived your first 
 Tribal Council. 
Grab your torches. 
You'll have fire. 
Head back to camp. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode. 
Next time on Survivor: 
Kel is accused 
 of smuggling food. 
Jerri blatantly said 
 that she saw something 
that looked just 
 like beef jerky. 
KEL: 
 It was a blade of grass,
and I was chewing on that. 
It was nowhere near any grass. 
JEFF: 
 Kimmi struggles with 
 the immunity challenge. 
You got cow brain there. 
I can't eat a brain. 
You're good.
I wouldn't have minded getting 
voted off if I had fell... 
fallen during a competition, 
 if I was lazy, 
if I wasn't a team player, 
 but when I come here, 
and I give all of that, 
 and I still get voted off, 
I bet you if Jeff had read 
 every one of those votes, 
it would have been seven to 
 one, and that's-that's a shame.
I still thought a lot of it 
boiled down to mental toughness 
and physical ability, 
and none of that even mattered.
