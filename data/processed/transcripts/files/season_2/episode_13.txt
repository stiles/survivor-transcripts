         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
The Barramundi camp was washed 
 away by a flash flood. 
Oh, God. 
Whoa. 
TINA: 
 I saw the devastation, 
and my first thought was, 
 you know, that's our home. 
COLBY: 
 It wiped everything out, 
 you know, including 
a good portion of 
 everybody's emotional steam. 
ELISABETH: 
 Because this group 
 has really endured a lot, 
it's tough to have 
 to go and cast a vote. 
JEFF: 
 At Tribal Council, 
 the Ogakor alliance 








turned on one of their own, 
 making Amber 
the 11th person voted out. 
Five remain. 
 Who will be the next to go? 
RODGER: 
 Gonna try and get everything 
 cleaned off this beach. 
We never know when we're 
 going to have another 
torrential rain like we had 
 a couple of days ago. 
Took out everything. 
ELISABETH: 
 I woke up this morning, 
and I was so wet 
 on one side, I'm like, 
"Did I go to the bathroom 
in my sleep?" 
Like, I couldn't... 
 I don't ever... 
I never think I've ever 
 had that feeling, 
'cause my left side was just 
soaked from the ground. 
KEITH: 
 It rained a lot last night 
 and our new shelter leaked. 








I didn't sleep all night. 
Everyone was a little 
 drained this morning. 
COLBY: 
 The closer you get to the end, 
the more you think about 
what's waiting for you 
 when you leave-- 
be it food, be it your family, 
your bed, your pillow. 
TINA: 
 I miss my husband and my 
 children more than anything. 
I'm still kind of a newlywed. 
I've only been married 
 just a year and a half, 
and my husband 
 is my very best friend. 
And I miss picking my kids up 
 from school 
and having my son 
 happy to see me. 
And I just miss 
 everything about them. 
COLBY: 
 With the storm that came 
 through and the shelter, 
that's the worst 
 I've seen Tina. 
She was at a rock bottom. 
But Elisabeth's 
been that way for awhile. 
Physically, Elisabeth's 
run down, and emotionally, 
and she's the one we've all 
 tried to nurture a little bit. 
Wish we had a couple days 
 without any rain, 
that's what I wish. 
I don't think 
 we're going to get it. 
I woke up this morning 
 wet and... 
still trying to recover 
from being really hungry. 
The past four days 
 really wrecked me. 
Let's see what 
our tree mail says today. 
Ooh. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
RODGER:
 Let's hold
 the end of it.
"For 34 days 
on yourself you've relied 
"It's your strength 
 and your wits 
"That the challenge has tried 
"Now you will trust 
 in your loved one or mom 
Oh, my God. 
 E-mail? 
We get to compete 
against each other 
with our loved 
ones online. 
Oh, my God!
Oh, wow. 
You guys, 
 this is awesome!
I can't even contain myself! 
KEITH:
 Relax.
I can't. I can't. 
Tree mail said that we'll rely 
 on our loved one or my mom. 
( crying ): 
 My mom is the... 
She's my hero, 
 like, she is just... 
the most amazing, strong woman. 
She got through breast cancer 
 and chemo like a trouper, 
and any time I think that 
 things get tough out here, 
I know what she's been through.
She's my hero. 
And with her, I can do anything.
Let's go get ready. 
Come on in, guys. 
Welcome to the Outback 
 Internet Cafe-- 
Survivor style. 
Woo! 
Thanks to technology, 
you're about to chat 
online 
with your loved ones. 
Oh, isn't 
 that amazing. 
In fact, how well you 
do in this challenge 
will really be all up 
 to your loved ones, 
because they're going 
 to be playing this game 
right along with you-- 
 one at a time, 
you're going to ask them 
a series of survival 
 trivia questions. 
The loved one who answers 
the most questions correctly 
will determine 
 which of you will win. 
For the winner, 
a private 30-minute chat 
 with your loved ones online. 
When the winner's done chatting,
I'm gonna give you 
 this Visa card-- 
$500 spending limit-- 
where you can buy whatever 
 you want for your loved ones. 
Point, click, shop, 
24 hours later, they'll have 
 a package delivered. 
Oh, my God! 
Wouldn't really be a true 
Internet cafe if we didn't have 
coffee and a Danish, 
so as each of you come up here 
 to say your initial hellos, 
I'll pour you a cup of coffee, 
pick your favorite Danish. 
All right, Tina, 
 let's start with you-- 
you look eager to say hi. 
Have a seat. 
Want a nice coffee? 
Sure. 
And help yourself 
 to a Danish.
You have your husband, Dale, 
and your son, Taylor, 
and your daughter, Katie. 
Hello, family. 
I sure miss you. 
DALE: 
 There she is. 
That's your mom
 right there.
"Hello, family." 
Hey, babe. 
We love you... and we... 
Dale must be typing. 
"Hel... lo."
...D and K. Cool. 
TINA: 
 "Hey, babe. 
"We love and miss you. 
You go, girl. 
 Taylor, Dale and Katie." 
All right, Elisabeth, 
 come on up.
Okay, here's who's at home 
 waiting for you-- 
your mom, Elisabeth, 
 your dad, Kenneth, 
and your brother, Ken. 
Oh, my God.
I'm sensing 
a pattern there. 
ELISABETH:
 I love you... 
bunches, miss you more. 
Safe and sound. 
( crying ): 
 Love, Bessy. Okay. 
Send, okay. 
It's Elisabeth.
"Love you bunches, 
 miss you more. 
"Safe and sound. 
Love, Bessy." 
"Elisabeth, 
I can't believe it's you. 
Dad's here, Kenny is here. 
 What's happening there?" 
I can't tell you. 
Talk to you soon. 
Rodger, come on up. 
Welcome. 
Thank you, buddy. 
Let me tell you who
 you're talking to. 
Your wife, Pat, 
your daughter, Angela, 
 Good. 
and your son-in-law, Kevin. 
 Good. 
Okay. 
( chuckling ): 
 There it is. 
"Hello, family. 
Doing good. 
 I love you guys." 
Is that a little 
tear in your eye? 
Yes, sir, it is. 
 Yep. 
Here we go. 
COLBY: 
 What are they saying, Rodge? 
How 'bout you 
 read that?
I'll read it for you. 
"We are doing good. 
We miss you 
and are very proud of you." 
Whew. 
ELISABETH: 
Worth the wait, Rodger. 
I knew I should have 
 brought my sunglasses.
Come on up, Keith.
All right, Keith, 
Katrin ring a bell? 
Your sweetie? 
She's there, 
 waiting to hear from you. 
We... call each other 
 Peas and Carrots. 
Hello, Peas, miss you so much. 
I'll never be gone 
this long from you again. 
I love you. 
Hello, Carrots. 
You can call me Sweet Pea. 
Right on cue, huh? 
"Hello, Carrots, 
 you can call me Sweet Pea now. 
I love you, too." 
Have a seat,
 Colby.
Help yourself 
 to a Danish. 
You've got, Gaye, your mom. 
 No way. Sweet. 
Hey, gang. 
 The Colbster is still alive. 
I love you. 
The best thing about this 
 is just being able 
to let her know I'm still okay. 
We're best friends, 
 and it's so much more 
than just a mother-son 
 relationship. 
She's everything. 
My mom just said, "Hi, baby." 
She always calls me her baby boy
'cause my brother's 
 older than I am. 
( sighs ) 
That-that's what I needed, 
 right there. 
RODGER:
 I guess you guys realize
 that us three men 
fell apart worse than 
 any of the women did. 
Very big strong men.
I was pretty composed 
 until she responded. 
That was 
the way with me. 
I thought I was doing good 
until those words came
 across the screen.
Once the words came up, 
 that was it for me. 
JEFF: 
Okay, we'll start the challenge.
Here's the deal: you're going 
 to each ask the same set 
of five questions 
 to your family. 
The winner will be the person 
 whose family answers 
the most questions correctly. 
Tina, you're up. 
Read off the questions 
 and hit "send." 
Oh, my gosh, this is a 
 good question for all of us. 
"In the Southern Hemisphere..." 
DALE: 
 "...the sun rises 
 in which direction?" 
It always rises in the east. 
East is "C." 
Question number two... 
"True or false, 
the emu is the largest bird 
 in the world." 
"The emu is the largest
 bird in the world." 
Okay, "True." 
Number three. 
I have to get back
 to the question. 
Question three: 
"Heat cramps are caused 
 by a loss of: 
A) water, B) sugar..." 
"...number C) salt, 
number D) protein?" 
The answer is "C." 
Question number four: 
"Australia's famous 
 for its scary snakes. 
Of the ten most venomous snakes 
 in the outback..." 
KATRIN: 
"...how many live in Australia?"
( laughs ): 
 Oh, my God. 
"A) Three, B) Six, 
 C) Nine, D) Ten." 
I have no idea. 
"A"? 
Number five: "If you are one 
mile from a lightning strike... 
"...approximately how long 
 would it take you 
"to you hear the thunder? 
"A) One second, 
 B) Three seconds, 
C) Five seconds, 
 D) Seven seconds." 
This sounds like 
 it's backward to me. 
I'm going 
to say "D) Seven seconds." 
JEFF: 
 Okay, ready for the results? 
First question: 
 "In the southern hemisphere, 
the sun rises 
 in which direction?" 
Correct answer was "C) East." 
Second question: "The emu is 
the largest bird in the world." 
"False." Ostrich. 
Third question: "Heat cramps 
are caused by a loss of... 
C) Salt." 
Oh, gosh. 
JEFF: 
 Fourth question: 
"Australia is famous 
 for its scary snakes. 
"Of the ten most venomous snakes
 in the outback--" key word-- 
"...how many live in Australia?"
Obviously, all ten. 
Last question: 
Gosh. 
JEFF: 
 "If you are one mile 
 from a lightning strike, 
approximately how long would it 
take you to hear the thunder?" 
It's a myth 
 that it's one second. 
It is five seconds. 
All right, 
 before I announce the winner, 
let's recap 
what you're going to win. 
30 minutes online 
 with your family, 
$500 shopping spree, 
 courtesy of Visa, 
and for the rest of you, 
 one final moment 
to say good-bye. 
Winning the reward with
 four correct answers...
Tina. 
 ( Tina screams happily ) 
RODGER: 
 Okay! Go for it!
JEFF: 
 Congratulations, Tina. 
It feels good to win something, 
 for heaven sakes! 
JEFF: 
 All right, Rodger, 
 you get one last good-bye. 
RODGER: 
 You will not believe 
 the things I have saw and done.
I love you guys. 
Whew. 
I told you I was going to... 
 need those. 
She said, "I will fatten you up 
 when you get home. 
"We all love you and miss you, 
 and can hardly wait... 
"for you to be home. 
"Keep smiling 
 and continue the adventure. 
Love, your mom." 
ELISABETH: 
 "Elisabeth, sorry 
 we didn't come through." 
Don't be sorry. 
"We love you, 
and we're so proud of you. 
We pray for you every day. 
 Kisses and hugs." 
( sniffles ) 
I can only think of 
 one important question 
that came to me one night 
as a shooting star 
 shot across the sky 
at some wee hours 
 of the morning: 
"Will you marry me, Peas?" 
COLBY: 
 Oh, my gosh.
Hope you were expecting 
 something like this. 
( other exclaiming ) 
COLBY: 
You did it. 
You did it. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, my gosh! 
Oh, my God. 
"Will you marry me, Peas?" 
Oh, my God. 
( long exhale ) 
Are you serious? 
Can you imagine being 
on the other end 
of this, though? 
"Would you type that
 response again? 
I'm not sure I 
 read that right." 
"Yes!" 
Yes! Yes. Yes! 
Yes! "You caught me off guard. 
"I've missed you more 
 than words can say. 
"I'm sorry I missed the cues. 
"It has been a long week. 
I love you and hope 
 to see you soon. Yes!" 
Congratulations, Keith. 
Whoo, whoo! 
Wow! 
All right, Tina. 
The throne is yours.
Okay. 
Whenever I got 
 on the computer, 
I could not type fast enough. 
I said, "We won. 
"Of all the things that I wanted
 to win, this was it. 
I wanted to talk to you 
 all so... much." 
I got a major rush from getting 
 to talk to my family. 
And I thought, 
that's enough to carry me 
through another 
 eight days, easy. 
I love and miss you all more 
 than you will ever know, 
and I will never ever go away 
 again for this long. 
I thought, "Eight more days? 
 Got it beat, girl." 
RODGER: 
 Best day out here. 
Rewards challenge, 
and we all won, every one of us.
Everybody won today. 
We all got to talk 
to our families back home. 
( thunder rumbles ) 
I mean, even in the rain--
 it's finally soaked 
through my shorts 
 and my boots-- 
my feet are soaking wet-- 
and I'm still... 
 have a grin on my face.
ALL: 
 Mm-hmm. 
TINA: 
 After I won my reward, 
the main emotion was sheer joy. 
Look at this, 
 a little recreation going on. 
COLBY: 
 Nice! 
TINA: 
 I mean my mouth hurt 
 from just smiling 
the whole time I was typing. 
Just the few words 
 that we got to exchange 
between one another, 
it was just sheer joy. 
COLBY: 
 Hey, Tina, 
 Keith's going to say grace. 
Dear God, thank you for today.
It was an incredible day. 
On a personal note, 
 thank you for the "yes" 
from my sweetheart, Katrin. 
And keep sending those prayers 
 back home 
for loved ones 
to know that we miss them. 
Keep them safe 
 and continue to keep us safe 
in our last few days. 
And we really thank you 
 for this opportunity 
and the experience 
we've had in the outback. 
Amen. 
Amen. 
COLBY: 
 I think it was apparent 
 to everyone here that today, 
at least for a day, 
strategy did not enter 
 in our heads. 
And that probably 
 won't be the case tomorrow, 
but today, we didn't care 
 about winning a million bucks. 
RODGER: 
It's going to be a cold, 
cold night tonight. 
TINA: 
 Colby, you're the 
 candle blower-outer.
Gotcha. 
TINA: 
 Good night, everybody. 
KEITH: 
 Good night.
COLBY: 
Good night. 
See you in the morning.
Lights are out. 
Keith, you ready? 
KEITH: 
 Yes, sir. 
( thunder crashing ) 
( crackling ) 
KEITH: 
 Rodger and I are usually up 
 right around the first time, 
you know, before anybody. 
We had a bad night of rain, 
so any time we have rain, 
we more than likely 
 lose our fire. 
Starting fire in the morning 
 is really very, very difficult.
We were out just doing 
 our morning bathroom break, 
and I looked off to the horizon.
I said, "What is that smoke 
 over there?" 
( grunts ) 
We found an actual piece 
of tree that was smoldering 
 from a forest fire 
that was probably 
 two weeks old. 
God's giving us a present 
 this morning, 
on this cold, wet morning. 
That was a huge find for us. 
It was the basis 
 behind a great fire. 
Do you believe that? 
 I can't. 
I literally 
cannot believe that. 
You can see 
how a caveman 
learned about fire 
and captured it, 
picked it up, brought it back 
to where he was at. 
RODGER: 
 And that's how they started 
 having weenie roasts. 
KEITH: 
That was it. 
TINA: 
 I'm looking at the river, 
and it's running 
 through our old camp. 
That is truly amazing. 
Wow. 
From a material standpoint, 
 we've lost a lot. 
I mean, we have our rice, 
and now that we know 
 we have food, 
we rationed the rice 
for the amount of days 
 that we have left. 
ELISABETH: 
How much do we have left? 
RODGER: 
Two bags of brown rice 
and a bag of white rice. 
COLBY: 
 Keith is cooking way too much 
 rice at every meal. 
All you've got to do 
is just make smaller servings, 
 and-and he just... 
he can't get it 
 through his head. 
KEITH: 
 This is where the game 
 is really on right now. 
My intention is 
 that I'll be here 
with Colby and Tina 
 in the last three. 
At this stage of the game, 
 it's natural 
that political campaigning 
 is going on, 
especially with these 
 last few individuals, 
because they're your jury. 
I'm doing a lot more 
 of the cooking now. 
Now that it's 
 more one-on-one dynamic, 
it's important to be able 
 to do things 
that the other members 
 of the group see as a value. 
Let me try something 
on this-- 
a little experiment here. 
ELISABETH: 
 Keith just said, "I'm going 
 to do a little experiment 
with the brown rice 
 and white rice." 
I mean, our portions were huge.
 And he said, "You know, 
"I'm used to doing 
 this sort of thing. 
I can I assess 
 how much we have." 
I think he just feels 
 awfully comfortable 
with the fact 
 that he's going to be one 
of the final three or two, 
and he knows the portion sizes 
 will be bigger then. 
Is that rice cooked? 
KEITH: 
Just cooked 
a little bit of it. 
It's okay-- I blended 
it in with the white. 
The brown rice cooks up 
and expands so much more; 
gives you more volume. 
Keith, you said the exact 
 opposite five days ago. 
You said the brown rice 
 yields less. 
No, I said you have 
to use more water. 
No, you said it yields less. 
You said it three times 
 in a row. 
I said, 
if you don't use more water. 
Half a cup ration. 
We decided on that, 
 Colby... 
and we have not stuck to it 
in the last four meals. 
Colby... 
I'm not going to do 
this ration thing again, 
where we run out of rice, Keith.
We're fine. 
 We're eating fine. 
Okay, well, 
we'll be fine. 
I'll check it again, 
but I'm sure 
we're more than fine. 
ELISABETH: 
I think we should check 
it right after we eat. 
KEITH: 
Yeah, I actually checked it 
before we ate, actually. 
The rice issue today 
 was the first time 
I've seen Colby blow up, 
and, uh, it got me 
 legitimately concerned, 
especially when Elisabeth was 
 right there, chiming in. 
I thought, 
'There's something 
 going on here, 
and I'm really 
in a very vulnerable situation.'
We had 14 days' worth of rice 
 with 12 days left, 
and we're now breaking even. 
ELISABETH: 
...with the brown rice, 
which doesn't even equal 
the white. 
KEITH: 
No, it does equal. 
COLBY: 
 No, it doesn't, Keith.
You're arguing yourself 
 is what you're doing, 
'cause you said two times 
in a span of five minutes 
that brown rice does not yield 
 the same amount as white rice. 
I just said you have to use 
more water to cook with. 
 No, you didn't. 
He's a fool-- the guy's a bozo, 
and I'm just tired of it. 
I'm tired of dealing with him. 
I don't take anything 
 that Keith does 
for face value. 
I think there's 
an ulterior motive 
 to everything he says 
and everything he does, 
 whether it's cooking rice 
or proposing 
 to his girlfriend on-line. 
I don't like the way 
 he's playing 
the game, and I think 
 he's trying way too hard 
because he can't make it 
 on just being who he is. 
My game with Keith is done. 
 It's over. 
The rice cakes worked 
 beautifully. 
COLBY: 
 As far as what's 
 wearing on me the most: time. 
The long days. 
That's the only thing 
 getting to me, nothing else. 
And if it weren't 
 for the long days, 
Keith wouldn't even get to me. 
I mean, I wouldn't be 
 as volatile as I am 
if it wasn't for the boredom. 
KEITH: 
 Not unusual to sit 
 and look at the fire 
for an hour 
and just stare 
 at the fire and the flames. 
COLBY: 
 Your fire becomes 
 what's been referred to 
as the "outback television." 
I mean, and that's what it is. 
That's your entertainment. 
You look and see 
 how long an ember can burn 
or how long it takes 
 a log to burn in half 
to where it collapses. 
It's just one of those things. 
You color in a coloring book 
or you play a few 
 games of backgammon. 
Or you get into 
 a conversation with someone 
that you forgot you had 
 three days ago. 
Make, like, red
 cardboard paper
and then I put the white
 doilies in the center. 
In my kitchen, in my dining
 room, we have hearts. 
You just have to walk through 
 them all throughout the house.
COLBY: 
 Cold, hunger, wet-- 
none of that can compare 
 to the boredom. 
It doesn't even fit 
 in the same category, 
as far as I'm concerned. 
RODGER: 
 I literally cannot stand, 
 like, to go up there 
and just lay 
 around in that hut 
for three or four hours, 
 just drives me crazy. 
I said I got to get up 
 and get out of here. 
I said I can't stay 
in this hut laying around. 
( groans ) 
COLBY: 
 Rodger's always 
 chipped in more 
than he's had to 
 with the tribe, 
whether it be fishing 
 or boiling water. 
He's always up to do stuff. 
Being the oldest guy still here,
he's got more energy 
 than any of us do, you know, 
and I think it 
 comes from his heart. 
Out by the bathroom, 
 I found some more bark. 
COLBY: 
 Because we're not 
 playing for ourselves now, 
we're playing for those 
 who are deserving to be here. 
Rodger 
and Elisabeth 
and Tina are all three 
deserving to be 
 in the final three. 
As far as Keith goes, 
there's not anything 
 outstanding or phenomenal 
that he's done 
 that has kept him in the game. 
Immunity plays 
 a huge part in this 
because immunity 
 could mean 
anyone can be along 
farther in the game. 
and at this point, 
 anybody could win. 
Up through here
 somewhere is 
the nearest path. 
Look at that. 
Five lanterns. 
And a lock. 
Want to take it back up 
there before we open it? 
Yeah, let's do that.
COLBY: 
There's an old lock 
and the message 
 reads like this:
"Many of the first settlers 
"came as prisoners here. 
"They'd escape into the outback,
no water, no food, no beer. 
"Your next challenge 
is a jail break. 
"These lamps 
will light your way. 
"And if you listen carefully, 
in the final four you'll stay." 
I think it'll be fun. 
It'll be interesting. 
This will 
 be a blast. 
Yeah. 
JEFF: 
 Hey, guys. 
Hi, Jeff. 
I'll start by taking 
 the immunity necklace, 
since you're shackled. 
Immunity back up 
 for grabs tonight. 
Now, the reason 
 you're shackled: 
the reason is 
because the first 
 settlers here in the outback 
were themselves prisoners. 
In a minute, I'm going 
 to tell you a story 
about these prisoners, 
 and when I'm finished, 
you're going to use 
 the information 
in that story 
 to free yourself. 
You're going to make your way 
 through this 
abandoned cattle station 
 where there are 
eight different questions 
 based on the story. 
Each correct answer to a 
question gives you a key, 
and that key 
 will open up any one 
of your five locks. 
However, if you answer 
 the question wrong, 
you won't be able 
to open the lock, 
 and you must move on 
to another one 
 of the eight stations. 
You continue making your way 
 through the stations 
till you've unlocked 
 all five shackles. 
The first person back here 
 completely freed, 
carrying their open shackles 
and their locks, wins immunity. 
Okay, here's the story: 
The first settlers 
 were prisoners 
brought over here 
 from Great Britain. 
Now, occasionally, a prisoner 
 tried to escape, 
but the only place 
 they had to go 
was into an early grave 
because these escapees, 
 known as bolters, 
lacked one basic thing-- 
they lacked basic 
 survival skills. 
Sun was their number one enemy. 
Temperatures can reach upwards 
of 110 degrees. 
You can live for 30 days 
 without food. 
Dehydration will kill you 
 in three days. 
Prisoners tried to fight this 
by taking off their clothes, 
which exacerbated 
 the dehydration process. 
And, in spite of 
 how arid it is out here, 
a lot of sources of water, 
if you know where to look. 
Same with food. 
You've tasted some of the food 
 from the outback. 
Mangrove worms, 
even spiny leaf insects, 
which are a better 
 source of protein 
than the bigger lizards. 
You get tired of bugs 
 and reptiles, 
bats will lead you 
 to large fruit 
that is colorless but edible. 
Birds will lead you to fruit 
 that is pretty but inedible. 
Their sense of geography 
 was so skewed 
that they thought 
 China and India 
were just around the corner, 
thinking China was only 
150 miles from Australia. 
Had they known 
 some basic skills, 
they could have found their way.
For example, when visible 
during the summer months, 
the Seven Sisters constellation 
 shows you which way is south. 
So the conditions out here 
were very tough, 
but they weren't 
 insurmountable. 
Aboriginals have lived out here 
since 38,000 BC, 
which proves that 
 people can and do 
learn to survive. 
Now we're going to see 
 what you guys have learned. 
Let's play. 
Survivors, ready? 
For immunity, go! 
TINA: 
 The lock is killing my shin. 
"According to prisoner's 
 flawed geography, 
what country was just 
150 miles from Australia?" 
"How long have Aboriginal people
been living in Australia?" 
40,000 years. 
"In which season 
is the Seven Sisters 
 constellation not visible?" 
Summer. 
Dad gummit. 
Okay. 
"To avoid dehydration 
 from the blazing sun, 
it's better to...?" 
"Remove clothing, 
wear clothing." 
Okay... 
Okay. 
 Come on. 
Get out. 
"What was the slang 
for an escaped prisoner?" 
Stepper. 
Oh, no, that's wrong. 
"When searching for fruit, 
 it's best to follow the..." 
"Pound for pound, which is 
 a better source of protein? 
Insect or lizard?" 
Insect or lizard? 
 Insect or lizard? 
I'm going to go with lizard. 
( sighs ) 
"Death by dehydration 
 occurs how many times 
faster than death 
 by starvation?" 
Ooh... 
ELISABETH: 
 Come on. 
I guess not. 
Come on, come on, 
come on, come on. 
"Death by dehydration 
occurs how many times faster 
than death by starvation?" 
Five times. 
I thought that 
 was the wrong answer. 
What country was 
 just..." 
"To avoid dehydration 
 from the blazing sun..." 
RODGER: 
 20,000 years. 
"To avoid dehydration 
 from the blazing sun..." 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
"How many times...?" 
Five times. 
 Ten times. 
Come on. 
"When searching 
 for fruit..." 
Bats. 
Is that not right? 
Guess it's not right. 
Oh, yes, come on, 
 it should work. 
I need this. 
JEFF: 
 Got them all? 
KEITH: 
 I don't know, 
 I don't know. 
One, two, three. 
Keith, that's just four. 
Got to have 
all five to win, bud. 
Shoot, where's my 
 other lock at? 
You got 'em? 
Let me see them.
Damn it. 
Hands and ankles. 
 That's it. 
Immunity. 
Sweet, baby!
Got immunity: Colby.
Damn! 
You beat me! 
What'd you forget?
My lock, I lost a lock
 running with it. 
Good job. 
Good job. 
JEFF: 
 Let me present 
 this to you again.
How many times in a row 
have you had immunity? 
Three times.
Three times, man. 
You are tough. 
Thank you very much.
You're safe 
tomorrow night. 
You four are vulnerable. 
I know you're a tight group. 
It's part of the game. 
Head back to camp. 
I'll see you tomorrow 
night at Tribal Council. 
RODGER: 
 I don't know 
what's going to happen 
 at tonight's Tribal Council. 
I got the impression that, uh, 
 it would probably be myself 
and Elisabeth, 
 not necessarily in that order, 
would be the next two 
 to be voted off. 
Well, Tina mentioned 
which one I felt 
 needed the money the worst-- 
myself or Elisabeth. 
I said I think Elisabeth 
 probably does 
because of, uh, 
 Elisabeth's background 
and her mother being sick, 
 and what have you. 
And I just decided 
that I would take the out first
 for Elisabeth. 
I was the chief 
 executive officer 
in a bank for 12 years, 
so, you know...
That makes me 
feel real good to hear. 
Yeah. Yeah.
So, Elisabeth's 
 a nice young lady.
I think about 
 as much of her
as I do a lot of 
 members of my family. 
I really do.
I do, too. 
Yeah, an awful
 sweet girl. 
When somebody's 
got medical bills... 
Here she comes. 
I really wouldn't want 
 Elisabeth to know 
that I had done that. 
But Elisabeth and myself 
 have become very close, 
and I've kind of watched out 
 for her. 
And that's basically it, really.
Basically the reason. 
I'll share my seat
 there with her. 
I'm just setting there, 
we're just 
 setting there yakking, 
and I'm so rude. 
You are, Rodger.
That's what I 
 think of you-- rude.
KEITH: 
 Rodger just wanted it 
 to be known 
that when it comes to picking 
 Elisabeth or himself 
to go first, 
 he wanted to go first. 
But you don't know 
 what's really going to happen. 
I could be voted off tonight 
 and totally blindsided. 
ELISABETH: 
 Tribal Council 
 is more up in the air 
than I would have thought 
 tonight. 
Colby supposedly 
 was voting for Rodger, 
and I don't know if Keith 
 has driven him crazy enough 
that he'll vote for Keith. 
Everybody have their bag? 
COLBY: 
 The biggest struggle 
 I deal with 
in the final few 
 Tribal Councils 
is whether I want 
 to sit beside someone 
who almost guarantees me 
 the million bucks, 
or whether I want to sit 
 beside someone 
who, if I don't win 
 the million bucks, 
I'll still feel good 
about that other person 
 winning. 
I don't even have 
 my answer to that. 
I did yesterday, 
but it changed this morning, 
and it'll change again tonight. 
We'll bring in 
the jury now. 
I'll once again remind you 
 not to address the jury. 
As we wind down 
to six days left, 
certainly the information 
 they gather at Tribal Councils 
becomes 
increasingly significant. 
Keith, how big 
of an impact 
does daily life have 
 at this point? 
You wake up in the morning 
with one idea 
of who you're going 
to vote out tonight. 
By the time you get here, 
it's completely different. 
Is that plausible, possible? 
You know, you play 
a lot of mind games 
 with yourself. 
I mean, you 
are your own worst player 
at this stage of the game, 
'cause you're constantly 
 second-guessing 
your thought process, 
 and, you know, 
you're confident here, 
and then you're not confident 
 there, and... 
This game, as I keep saying, 
 "expect the unexpected" 
because... 
 it's where it is right now. 
Is there a sense of paranoia 
 that takes over? 
You see two people 
 huddled in the corner, 
you think, "I know 
they're talking about me. 
They're going 
 to vote me out tonight." 
Is that starting to happen? 
TINA: 
 Absolutely.
Whenever there's 
 this few people left, 
and you think,
"This is closer than I thought, 
"and I could make it, you know? 
I've only got six days left." 
And then you see 
 some people whispering, 
and you're like, 
"Oh, my gosh, you know,
 I could go tonight." 
Y-You do. 
You start getting 
nervous and paranoid, 
and then your whole 
 day's blown, you know,
'cause you don't know 
 what's going to happen. 
36 days 
 you guys have spent together. 
Some relationships have formed--
even ones I can see 
 from the outside. 
Elisabeth, tell me about 
the relationship with Rodger, 
because you guys seem 
to have really connected. 
Rodger is...
I call him my "outback daddy." 
( laughing )
He just really is.
And from the moment
 I saw him, 
I knew that there 
 was something special.
We've become friends. 
I feel safe 
with Rodger around, 
and Rodger's my man.
I love him. 
Rodger, how's it feel 
to have somebody say 
such kind words about you? 
Well, I'm very, very flattered. 
But I could very easily turn 
 the tables back on Elisabeth. 
She's a fine young lady, 
uh, character-wise, 
morals-wise, and uh... 
she's tops in my book. 
Keith, when you look at Colby 
 with that immunity necklace, 
knowing if you hadn't dropped 
 one of your locks, 
you'd be wearing it tonight, 
what goes through your mind? 
Do you care at all? 
You know, of course I wish 
 I had it around my neck, 
but that's the way 
 the cookie crumbles.
That was the way 
 the game was played, 
and it was all fair, 
and I dropped the lock, 
 and it was my faux pas, 
and, uh, that's 
 just the way it goes-- 
part of the game-- 
what are you going to do? 
Can't cry over spilled milk. 
JEFF: 
All right, guys. 
11 torches behind me. 
Five left. 
Another torch is going 
to join that tonight. 
Let's vote; 
 Elisabeth, you're up. 
This is a great group, 
 but Keith, I think 
that you've been a little 
 overconfident and cocky 
about how you're going 
 to be here till the very end. 
Old buddy, I look forward 
to that home-cooked meal 
in Kentucky. 
And if it's my time to go, 
I can't wait to see you 
 on the outside. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person 
voted out of the tribe 
will be asked 
to leave 
the Tribal Council area 
immediately. 
The first vote... 
Keith. 
Rodger. 
Keith. 
Rodger. 
Two votes Rodger, 
two votes Keith. 
One vote left. 
Rodger. 
You need to bring me 
your torch, Rodger. 
See you guys. 
See you, kiddo. 
Rodger, 
the tribe has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Grab your torches 
and head back to camp. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode, 
and hear 
 what Rodger has to say. 
Next time on Survivor: 
 only four remain of Barramundi,
and the outback has taken 
 its toll on all of them. 
My hair is falling out. 
My hair 
is falling out. 
And a surprise guest 
 visits the remaining survivors.
Whoo-hoo! 
Welcome to Barramundi! 
I was the oldest person 
 getting off the plane-- 
53 years old. 
I've been out here 36 days; 
 just had six more to go. 
Uh, I could've done 
 without food 
for those next six days, 
if I'd had to, 
 to have stayed out here. 
I wish them all the luck, 
 and I especially wish 
the best of luck to Elisabeth. 
I hope she goes all the way. 
Thank you.
