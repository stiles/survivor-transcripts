         JEFF PROBST: 
 Previously on Survivor: 
With Jerri gone, 
 Amber was on her own. 
KEITH: 
 She's kind of a lone lamb. 
I think Amber made a tactical 
mistake by staying 
 tight with Jerri. 
JEFF: 
 The food situation 
 was desperate... 
This is how much rice we have 
 left to last us 14 days. 
...and the tribe 
 was running on empty. 
ELISABETH: 
 I feel so weak. 
I'm feeling terrible. 
JEFF: 
 The rising waters 
 were a growing threat 








to the Barramundi camp. 
A storm could come and just 
 wash our tent right out. 
It's right in line 
 with the riverbed. 
JEFF: 
 At the immunity challenge, 
Colby's dwindling strength 
 didn't stop him 
from winning the talisman. 
COLBY: 
Yeah, baby! 
Yeah! 
JEFF: 
 Back at camp, the tribe 
 was offered more food. 
You've got 
13 days left, 
and I don't think 
 you're going to make it. 
But it came with a hefty price.
I need something of value. 
I'm talking camp-- 








your tarps and that Texas flag.
TINA: 
 I think it was a fair trade. 
There's worse things in life 
 than being wet, 
such as starving to death. 
JEFF: 
 At tribal council, 
 Jerri and Alicia 
returned 
 as members of the jury, 
and Nick was voted out. 
Six remain. 
 Who will be the next to go? 
? ? 
ELISABETH: 
 This game, 
 in the past three days, 
has become drastically primal. 
We are just 
beings out here that need food. 
AMBER: 
The servings 
are so small. 
It's, like, 
 maybe four spoonfuls. 
ELISABETH:
 Yeah, it's turned 
 into a nightmare, 
all of a sudden. 
You just can't think about it. 
The things that are important 
 have become really clear here. 
You know, you shed 
 yourself of all excess, 
and we just gave up 
 our shelter for food, 
and that is a pretty, 
pretty extreme situation. 
AMBER: 
 When we got our new rice, 
 we decided we needed to be 
very, very careful 
 with it this time. 
The risk of losing it again 
just wasn't 
 going to be an option. 
So we measured out the rice, 
cup by cup by cup by cup. 
This is the least amount 
 of rice we've ever had. 
No wonder we're all 
 so weak and tired. 
This is all we're living on. 
ELISABETH: 
Anyone want some 
scrapings 
from the pot? 
TINA: 
 That rice gave me hope 
 that I was not 
going to have to be out here 
 starving to death 
for the next 11 days, 
which, to be honest, that's what
I thought was going to occur. 
AMBER: 
 Hope factors in a huge amount 
for your existence here. 
I mean, you always have to hope
 for the next day to come, 
hope for a fish, 
a nice night with no rain. 
And I just keep hoping that 
 the next three days to come, 
I'm still here 
and the next three days to come 
that I'm still here. 
ELISABETH: 
 Keith, Colby and Tina 
 are three together. 
And they see Amber, 
 although she's grown a lot, 
they don't see 
 that she is a strong person. 
TINA: 
 Amber's a sweet girl, 
 but you can't 
get by just on 
 flying below the radar. 
She never really proved to me 
that she could stand 
 on her own two feet. 
Now, she has proved to me 
that she's a tougher little girl
than I made her out to be. 
ELISABETH: 
 The people who are in control 
 are basically 
going to push your eject button
one time or another, 
 and you just hope it's not 
the next time. 
COLBY: 
 Rodger and Elisabeth both know 
 that we brought them along 
this entire time with 
 the intent to eliminate them 
before we eliminate ourselves. 
And they are well aware 
 of the fact 
that they've got to win immunity
in order to stick around. 
ELISABETH: 
 The next challenges 
 are very important to me. 
Reward and immunity. 
I don't care how 
 hungry and weak I am, 
there's no holding me back, 
 I need them. 
How you feeling? 
Good. 
Yeah? Okay. 
Today's challenge 
 is for reward. 
It's a ropes course, and it's 
designed to be confusing. 
It's a jungle rope maze. 
You'll have four checkpoints 
 along the way. 
At each checkpoint, 
there are several ropes 
that lead either directly 
or indirectly 
 to the next one. 
You'll have two carabiners. 
One carabiner needs to be 
attached to your rope 
 at all times. 
Whenever you change ropes, 
you take the other 
 carabiner that's free, 
clip to the new rope, then 
 unclip from the existing rope. 
First person to reach 
 all four checkpoints, 
get to the finish, 
 wins the reward. 
The reward is a food reward 
 with a twist. 
Yo, come on in! 
( horses whinning ) 
As you know, in the outback... 
Oh... 
Yeah. 
...lots of cattle, 
 lots of cattle ranches. 
Stockmen-- Australian cowboys-- 
are the guys who take care 
 of the cattle. 
AMBER:
 Oh, my God!
Oh, look at how beautiful. 
You're going to saddle up 
 on a horse with these guys, 
spend the night. 
You'll have a trek through 
the outback on horseback, 
you'll go back to their camp... 
 Oh, my God. 
...have some authentic 
 stockman grub-- 
what are you having... 
what's for dinner tonight? 
Beef stew, beans, 
and bread and butter 
and some cauliflower. 
JEFF: 
All the Bud Light 
you can drink 
to go with that? 
Sounds good. 
 What about breakfast? 
You can have bacon and eggs 
 and some coffee. 
Oh, God!
You'll also have 
 a cot to sleep on. 
Wow. 
 That's a good reward. 
Let's head to the game. 
 We'll see you guys at the end. 
Thanks.
Bye.
 Bye.
JEFF: 
 Let's go. 
Survivors, ready? 
Go!
Almost there! 
Keep going, Amber.
He's wearing down.
Nice job. 
( Amber groaning ) 
Way to go,
 Rodger. 
You're coming in
 for the bronze. 
That-a-way, Rodg. 
 Way to go, Tina.
JEFF: 
 Way to finish,
 Elisabeth.
COLBY:
 You got it, girl. 
TINA: 
 Go, girl! 
 All the way!
JEFF: 
 That-a-way, Chef. 
 Finish strong.
Colby, come here. 
I want to give you 
 a little taste 
of some of the food 
 you're going to have tonight. 
They call this damper. 
No, it's for him. 
Can I give it 
 to them?
No. I'm sorry, you can't. 
That's okay, Colby.
Oh, my God. 
 That's okay, Colby.
This is just 
a little sample here. 
Take a little bite of this. 
They make this up 
all the time. 
Good stuff? 
You can take this 
on your horseback ride. 
The boys are waiting 
for you just up ahead. 
TINA: 
 Enjoy it. 
RODGER: 
 Have fun. 
JEFF: 
Have a good time, man. 
See you tomorrow. 
Thanks, guys. 
ELISABETH:
 Tell us all about it. 
Put some pork and beans 
in your pocket 
to bring back. 
AMBER:
 Get strong.
We'll miss 
 you tonight.
I'm ready. I'm excited. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
( leaves rustltling ) 
( thunder booms ) 
COLBY: 
 The storm hit about 
 ten minutes into the ride. 
( thunder crashing ) 
( speaking indistinctly ) 
We went right into 
 the face of the storm, 
and that kind of startled 
 the horses a little bit. 
( horse whinnies ) 
Heavy, heavy, heavy winds. 
You couldn't see 
 anything around you. 
It felt like hail, 
the raindrops 
 were coming down so hard. 
There was 
 so much water running, 
it really looked like there 
 was water running uphill. 
It was bad stuff. 
Worse than any storm 
 I've ever been through. 
I feel sorry for all those guys
that had to go back 
to a very wet Barramundi Beach. 
RODGER: 
 Wow! 
How fast did that come? 
Unbelievable. 
Oh, my gosh. 
AMBER: 
 This is unbelievable. 
This is, all this weather 
happened in an hour. 
We came across here, 
and there was one puddle. 
Let's hope 
 our riverbed
didn't get flooded
 like this. 
Our camp is gone. 
RODGER: 
 After seeing this, 
where we've got our camp 
is called a dry creek bed. 
I doubt it 
 if it's dry right now. 
TINA: 
The thing is, I don't know 
how we're going to get across. 
RODGER: 
It's going to be a good while 
before we get across here. 
We're talking some hours here. 
We had to wait two 
 or three hours 
till the creeks had gone down. 
( thunder rumbling ) 
Everybody had kind 
 of quit talking, 
but I knew what was on 
 everybody's mind. 
Everybody was thinking 
what's going to be left 
 back there 
when we get back there. 
? ? 
RODGER: 
 We're okay, girls... 
I think. 
KEITH: 
 Don't jump to 
 conclusions. 
Oh, gosh. 
We have barely anything. 
Oh, gosh. 
RODGER: 
 When I first come down 
 the bank there, 
I could see some blankets 
 hanging on the line, 
I thought, 
 "Oh, everything's okay." 
Then I walked another 20 feet 
 where I could see on over, 
and I could see that 
 everything wasn't okay. 
It looked like a small hurricane
or something went through there.
AMBER: 
Wow. 
RODGER: 
 It's here, but barely. 
I hope the rice is here. 
AMBER: 
 Oh, my God!
Where was the rice can? 
AMBER: 
Oh, my God. 
I don't even know 
where the rice can's at! 
Oh, my gosh... 
KEITH: 
I'll find it. 
Don't worry about it. 
The rice tin 
was right over here. 
The rice tin probably 
 washed away. 
ELISABETH: 
It looks like the rice 
is gone, you guys. 
No supper. 
Whoa. 
ELISABETH: 
 We were really wondering 
 if we'd get back here 
and find our dry riverbed 
 not so dry, and... 
despite all optimism and hope, 
our entire campsite 
 was washed out. 
Looks like a tornado
 went through here. 
RODGER: 
The rice is gone, 
our knives are gone... 
Absolutely incredible.
Where's our 
fishing tackle? 
Gone. 
Everything that was 
on that box, that table. 
Yeah, we had the hooks 
right up in there. 
KEITH: 
 That water came through 
 like a flurry 
and just took everything 
 with it. 
It was just... 
There was no way to describe it.
Especially when we're 
 out here with so little... 
We lost everything. 
TINA: 
 I walked down the hill 
and I saw the devastation. 
And my first thought was, 
you know, that's our home. 
Let's just see if 
 some of that stuff 
may have been stuck in here. 
TINA: 
 Washed away our food, 
 our cooking, 
our knives, everything. 
Everything's just gone. 
And to be honest, I was just 
really, really mad. 
I don't know who I was mad at 
 or what I was mad at. 
I was just angry. 
We have no food. 
No, none. 
We have no food. 
We can't even fish. 
We don't have 
fishing rods. 
We haven't eaten 
all day. 
( thunder rumbilng ) 
COLBY: 
 That challenge-and-reward 
 combination 
was tailor-made for me. 
Hey, Jeff.
You look like 
 you were born to ride. 
( laughs ) 
We've been having a great time. 
To be able to jump on horseback 
and go ride out to a camp 
 with a bunch of cowboys 
and sit around a campfire 
 and eat beans and beef stew. 
I mean, that's something 
 I would do at home. 
Thank you very much.
Oh, man, 
this is so good. 
So how do you assess
 your shot now? 
Nine days tomorrow,
 and you go back. 
You're obviously going
 to have a leg up, 
because right now,
this food's going to 
 give you a lot of energy. 
Well, physically maybe, 
 you have a leg up. 
Politically, 
you're a leg down, 
especially because 
this is my second 
reward in a row. 
You know, 
inevitably there's got to be 
 some resentment there. 
And a lot of that goes 
through your head, I mean, 
you think of the politics, 
 you think, 
"Well, do I pull up five feet 
 and let Amber win this?" 
Really? 
And then you... 
you just say no. 
You are here to win, 
 you're here to compete. 
And it may happen. 
I may get voted off 
in the next couple 
 of Tribal Councils. 
And if it does, I'm going to be 
 glad I ate this tonight. 
I feel just about as fortunate 
 as I have in 33 days 
to be able to not only get 
 a warm hot meal 
but also get a warm 
 dry bed to sleep in. 
Colby, final cheer.
I'm going to down this.
I'm gonna leave you.
Thanks, Jeff. 
It's a very bittersweet time, 
when you realize 
 what you're doing. 
Virtually, what I'm doing 
by enjoying coffee 
 and enjoying a cot 
is taking that opportunity 
 away from somebody else. 
This song's called 
"Drinking Beer With Your Mates."
( guitar plays ) 
? So set the drinks up, barman ?
? We've only got one day ? 
( guitar plays melody ) 
? And keep 'em comin', 
 pour the glass ? 
? And we'll all blow our pay ? 
? At night, 
 around our campfire ? 
? It's great to listen here ? 
? The stories get 
 a whole better ? 
? When you've got 
 a heap of beer. ? 
Yeah! 
( song ends ) 
AMBER: 
 When we got back 
 to the camp, 
we didn't really have much 
 to say to each other 
because we were all 
 just devastated. 
KEITH: 
 I'm going to 
 go further down
because that food 
 should float, you know?
Stuff could be caught,
dragged under here. 
AMBER: 
 Well, Tina and Keith 
 thought of going downriver 
and seeing if they can 
 find something 
that washed up on shore. 
KEITH: 
 So I just walked the riverbank 
and realized that on 
 the other side, 
our tin of food was there. 
It was still sealed. 
We need to cross
 down here, 
where the current's
 not so strong 
and go across the bank.
That's a little deep there. 
It may be deep. 
You're going to try 
to cross this current? 
You're crazy. 
Trust me, 
you can't cross that. 
You'll slip. 
I'd rather try that.
Hey, whoa, be careful 
out in that current. 
RODGER: 
 I wasn't so much worried about 
 him getting knocked down 
off the log on into the river. 
I was worried about him 
 falling backwards. 
You want a rope or something 
 to put around you? 
I was afraid he'd get swept 
 down underneath that log 
and be caught on some limbs 
 down underneath there, 
and there'd have been 
 no way in the world 
anybody would have been able 
 to get him out of there. 
TINA: 
 And, Keith, 
 how do you think
you're going to 
 get it back across?
You'll never make it. 
TINA: 
 I went on downriver. 
I think Keith was trying 
 to cross midway. 
I saw that the current 
 was strong... 
your adrenaline 
 gets pumping, 
and you just know, 
 I can do anything. 
AMBER: 
Keith... oh, my God, 
oh, my God, oh, my God. 
Tina's across, Keith! 
Keith, come back! 
Oh, they're making me 
so nervous. 
ELISABETH: 
I just don't 
want to take my eyes off them. 
RODGER: 
If you can't bring it all, 
just bring 
one plastic bag of it 
 over or something. 
Leave the can over there. 
Throw it behind you, 
and the rapids will bring it 
 right down to you. 
Ready? 
Watch... 
there's the current. 
Ready? 
 Yeah. 
RODGER: 
Y'all surprised me. 
I wouldn't have thought 
the chance of finding that 
was one in 10,000. 
AMBER: 
 I don't know how 
 you guys saw that.
I can't believe the lid 
 stayed on that thing. 
You guys are amazing. 
You are amazing. 
 Hey, good job, buddy. 
You make me 
want to cry. 
Tina, good job.
Thank you. 
One heck of a job.
Thank you, sir. 
Thank you so much. 
We're going to start a fire, 
 Tina. 
We're going to 
 get you warmed up.
TINA: 
 We were very hungry. 
It's the thing that 
 we feel most out here. 
And there was nothing 
 that would keep me 
from getting that rice can. 
It's just survival 
 of the fittest. 
And I want to eat, 
plain and simple. 
I want the rice. 
Food's everything to us 
 at this stage. 
Geez, we gave up our shelter 
 for our food. 
Then we lose it in the rain? 
 That's not going to happen. 
RODGER: 
Hey, Keith, 
do we have our matches? 
KEITH: 
No. 
They got wet. 
They were there in my coat, 
and the coat got wet-- 
they're wet. 
We got the rice, no fire. 
AMBER: 
 We were cold, and we were wet, 
 and we were thinking 
at least we can light a fire 
and dry off. 
And we had no way 
 of starting the fire. 
It was just devastating. 
I mean, it's like nothing else 
 could have gone wrong. 
RODGER: 
 I'd suggest to anybody 
 who don't have on 
dry clothes needs to be doing it
before dark falls here, 
cause we're all gonna be 
 freezing tonight. 
You can look forward 
to a good, warm night's 
sleep, eh, Colb? 
Oh, man. The cot, yeah. 
Breakfast in the morning. 
Bacon and eggs. 
 Golly! 
( laughter ) 
I'm gonna have
 to pace myself
a little better 
 than I did tonight.
I dug in too fast tonight.
I was hungry and I dove in, 
and the first plate I had 
 just... 
went straight through me. 
I felt awful. 
We were so used to eating 
nothing but rice out here, 
 my stomach just... 
it twisted and turned. 
As soon as that 
 second or third spoonful 
went in, 
 I knew it was gonna be trouble.
( sighs ) 
You couldn't help it? 
It went through me, man.
I just... I couldn't help it. 
It's been too long 
 since I've had any good food. 
( rain falling ) 
( insects chirping ) 
ELISABETH: 
 This is Survivor, you guys. 
This is the stuff 
that you just didn't plan for. 
RODGER: 
 You can't begin 
to tell anybody back home 
what you've been through. 
AMBER: 
 You can't even describe this. 
No. 
 It's something you 
 can't even describe. 
RODGER: 
 Survivor is definitely real. 
AMBER: 
This is no longer a game. 
RODGER: 
 This is... this is... 
ELISABETH: 
 No, this is life right now. 
( insects chirping ) 
COLBY: 
 Unequivocally, the best 
 peanut butter and jelly 
I've ever had in my life. 
I'm stuffed already-- 
 we hadn't even broken 
into the bacon and eggs, 
 and I don't give a damn. 
I'm gonna eat as much 
 as I can here, 
and then I'm gonna go 
 sit by the fire 
and eat as much 
 as I can over there. 
I may have to stop 
 and use the bathroom 
four times on the way 
 back to camp, 
and it doesn't matter. 
Mmm. 
Hey, Colby, how do you
 want your eggs, mate? 
Didn't you say you wanted them 
 fairly runny? 
 Yeah. 
I appreciated the opportunity 
 to eat incredibly. 
Just the opportunity, 
 no matter how sick it made me 
and no matter how sick 
 I feel now. 
I had that choice-- 
 I had the choice 
to eat and eat and eat. 
I'm very fortunate. 
Boy, that's good, Pedro.
Bacon, eggs, perfect. 
Beans are good.
Mmm.
( chirps ) 
KEITH: 
 That was the most miserable 
 night in my entire life. 
I can now say that. 
I will never have 
 a more miserable night. 
I hope not. 
ELISABETH: 
 We just have to... 
make sure that tonight's 
 a little more safe 
from the weather 
 than last night. 
And building a shelter. 
This is our first priority 
 right now. 
Hey, Rodger, 
the sand's actually dry 
in there, 
in the... in our thing. 
Are we thinking of 
 staying down there?
Right-right there 
 at the top of the ridge. 
Be nothing 
to build a little shelter. 
RODGER: 
 I had laid awake all night 
 thinking about the shelter. 
And I definitely did not want 
to put it back down there 
 on that sand. 
TINA: 
 There's no good place 
 to hide here. 
It's very frustrating. 
Where the heck do we build it, 
 you know? 
In the river bed 
 where it's gonna flood, 
or up on the high point 
 where we can get struck 
by lightning? 
RODGER: 
If we can get the roof on it, 
the first thing, 
get it like we want it, 
we can at least 
get underneath that tonight. 
( birds singing ) 
COLBY: 
 I think 
 this is the worst-case scenario
that could possibly happen-- 
returning to camp 
 and having to see 
what all your tribe mates 
 went through the night before. 
We tell each other 
 over and over, 
"When you win a reward, 
 don't feel guilty." 
But, inevitably, you... 
you feel guilty. 
And it wiped everything out, 
 you know, 
including a good portion 
of-of everybody's... 
 emotional steam. 
Oh, my gosh. 
I can't believe this. 
COLBY: 
I am so sorry 
y'all had to go
 through this. 
( Amber mumbles ) 
It'll be all right. 
COLBY: 
How are you, Tina? 
Did you have a good time? 
I know you were 
 thinking about us.
I was. 
TINA: 
 I know you were.
COLBY: 
 Oh, man.
Guys, I just... 
I can't believe 
what happened. 
When I walked up this morning...
RODGER: 
 Sickening,
 wasn't it?
COLBY: 
It's-it's sickening, 
you're right. 
COLBY: 
 Everyone's going 
 through the ringer right now. 
And out of all 
six of us, 
 I've been the luckiest. 
This immunity challenge is such 
 a double-edged sword for me. 
I'm worried 
 about saving my own butt, 
but a bigger part 
 of me is worried about 
winning another challenge 
 and how that's gonna effect 
the way I'm viewed. 
JEFF: 
You look worn out. 
We are. 
Quite a day yesterday. 
We'll be okay. 
We've made it 
up until now. 
We only have 
nine days left. 
We're gonna make it. 
Well, tonight 
we have a Tribal Council. 
I'll take back 
the immunity talisman. 
This is 
becoming very important 
at this stage of the game. 
Now, let's get 
to today's immunity challenge. 
You'll each have three plates 
 and a slingshot as a weapon. 
For ammo, 
Australian macadamia nuts. 
Your goal-- break the other 
 tribe member's plates 
before they break yours. 
When all your plates are broken,
 you're out of the game. 
The last person left standing 
 with a plate intact 
wins immunity, 
 and you make the final five. 
Take your spot at a weapon. 
Wait for my start. 
Remember, 
 you each have three plates. 
Last person 
with a plate intact wins. 
Survivors, ready... aim... 
fire. 
Ooh...! Hey.
KEITH: 
Sorry, bro. 
What's up with that? 
 It's the 
 pretty blue.
I love that color. 
You want to play 
like that, huh? 
JEFF: 
 Aim... fire. 
Oh... 
JEFF: 
First one down. 
COLBY: 
 The chef is cooked. 
Ouch. 
 Ooh, that hurt. 
JEFF: 
Aim... fire. 
JEFF: 
 Elisabeth and Amber. 
RODGER: 
Sorry, Amber. You... 
This-This is one straight away. 
JEFF: 
Amber, Elisabeth, Keith 
all have one plate out. 
Aim... fire. 
AMBER: 
 Hey, 
buddy! 
JEFF: 
Elisabeth, 
a gunslinger. 
Amber, down to one plate. 
Ready... aim... fire. 
JEFF: 
 Tina. 
COLBY:
 Sorry.
It was the closest one to me. 
JEFF: 
Aim... fire. 
Sorry, bro.
 It's all right. 
JEFF: 
Keith got even. 
Rodger has no plates out. 
Shh. Shh, don't... 
You don't have 
to tell them all that. 
JEFF: 
Aim... fire. 
Oh! 
Boy, that meal did you 
 some good. 
Hey, I don't know what it was. 
JEFF: 
Eyesight is sharp. 
Everybody has a plate out. 
 Amber has two. 
Aim... fire. 
Aim... 
fire. 
Amber, 
you're out of the game. 
Who took out Amber? 
 COLBY: 
 I did. 
It's nothing personal. 
I'm paying attention. 
JEFF: 
Ready... aim... fire. 
TINA: 
 Whoo! 
JEFF: 
 Keith down to one plate. 
Rodger, 
you're down to one plate. 
Ready... 
aim... fire. 
Ooh.
 Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh, Tina, wow. 
Sorry, sister. 
You get Colby 
over there, 
and I'll get Colby over here. 
 That's fine. 
Okay. 
 Well, now, come on, guys. 
Ready... 
His place... 
aim... 
fire. 
JEFF: 
Colby down to one plate. 
Aim... fire. 
JEFF: 
 Oh. 
Keith's out of the game. 
Take a seat next to Amber. 
Ready... aim... fire. 
Tina out of the game. 
See ya, Tina. 
Colby, you've 
taken a lot of people 
out of this game. 
What's wrong 
with this picture, Colby? 
 All the Ogakor.
What is wrong 
 with this? 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
I'm jumping ship. 
Here we go, guys. 
Ready... aim... 
fire. 
COLBY: 
 You're gone, Rodg. 
JEFF: 
Rodger is out of the game. 
Here's where
 we're at. 
Elisabeth, 
two plates perfectly intact. 
Colby down 
 to one already nicked. 
Another winger 
will take it out. 
Elisabeth, you got 
 a lot of pressure 
on you, girl. 
Which one are you going for, 
Elisabeth? 
There's three plates up there. 
Ready...
aim...
fire. 
Oh. 
ELISABETH: 
 Oh, boy. 
 You're down
to one plate each.
Take your time 
in your shots. 
This is for immunity. 
Ready...
aim... 
...fire. 
Elisabeth's out 
of the game. Colby. 
This is becoming 
a regular thing. 
Thank you.
Congratulations. 
Well, good luck 
with your camp. 
You'll have fire 
after tonight's Tribal Council. 
Okay, guys, I'll
 see you tonight.
KEITH: 
 Going to Tribal Council 
 is not a fun thing. 
I mean, 
 you have no real good reason 
for picking 
 to vote somebody off 
other than 
you're trying to get to the end.
AMBER: 
 It's sad to see 
another person go out 
 of your group. 
You know, that's less people, 
less comfort, 
 less conversations. 
I never, ever look forward to 
going to Tribal Council, never. 
I hate it. 
ELISABETH: 
 This group has really 
endured a lot and persevered 
 through some really 
torrential natural problems. 
Tribal Council 
 becomes really tough. 
I think this is gonna be 
one of the toughest ones 
 I've had to go to. 
We now bring in the jury-- 
 Alicia, Jerri and Nick. 
I'll just remind you, 
the jury's not to be addressed. 
They won't be addressing you, 
just gathering information. 
So when you last 
 left here, I said, 
"I wish for you dry weather 
and no rain." 
Obviously, my rain dance 
didn't work out too well. 
Rodger, 
there are two seasons 
in the outback-- 
dry season, the wet season. 
This landscape 
has changed 
from brown to green 
since we've been here. 
Yet you guys 
put your camp in the mouth 
 of a dry river bed. 
Whose idea was it 
to put it there? 
Uh... It was not my idea. 
I was wanting to go up 
 on the hill and build, 
but when the two tribes 
merged at that time, 
we took a consensus, 
and mostly the-the females 
thought the sand would sleep 
 better. I sure do wish 
we had went with mi-mine, 
 and then there was 
another one or two that felt 
like we should've went up 
on the hill, too, but we did 
 all pull together today. 
I mean, everybody 
pitched in and, uh, uh... 
we're gonna, 
we're gonna be all right. 
Elisabeth, 
how much more 
difficult is this 
 than what you expected? 
I can say this.
Every single day, 
especially within 
 the past four days,
each one has gotten 
 exponentially 
more challenging and difficult, 
and I have gone from playing 
this game challenge-to-challenge
to playing it day-to-day, 
and now I just play it... 
 minute-to-minute. 
KEITH: 
 After experiencing
what we experienced last night, 
it's hard to put 
the game into-into focus. 
No one person could've stayed 
 warm by themself last night. 
It took every person together. 
JEFF: 
Tina. 
You seem 
to be playing 
the political game-- 
which it is still very 
 political-- 
but in as friendly 
a manner as you can. 
Was that a plan 
all along? 
For me, 
that was exactly my plan, 
and I would 
 rather spend the last 
couple of weeks with people 
who get along, are team players 
and, you know, want to see 
 each other do well, and 
to me, that 
 just means more.
Let me follow that up, then. 
Is it fair to say 
that out of the 16, 
the six most deserving 
are still here? 
Um... I don't know 
 if I could say 
that the six most deserving, 
 but I can say 
that the six that are 
remaining are... you know, 
these people are all 
deserving, every one of them. 
Well, you guys 
 have obviously bonded 
as Barramundi, a new tribe. 
but I'd be remiss if I didn't 
 point out the fact 
there's still four Ogakor 
members and two Kucha. 
Rodger, you've been 
pretty secure 
every time 
you've come 
to Tribal Council. 
Still feeling 
 that secure tonight? 
Oh, no. The only way 
 I would feel secure 
is if I was wearing 
 this necklace 
that Colby's wearing, and, uh...
you never know what's gonna 
 happen when you come here, 
and I do think that eventually 
 the Kucha tribe will be 
an extinct tribe, somewhere, 
 somewhere down the line. 
JEFF: 
Well, Colby's on a run, 
that's for sure. 
 Certainly is. 
You're the only 
person who can't 
be voted for tonight, 
yet you still get a vote. 
Good place to be. 
Let's vote. 
 Elisabeth. 
You're up. 
Amber, 
 this is my toughest vote yet. 
It has to be done. 
It's nothing personal. 
Really a sweet girl. 
Very tough decision 
 for me to make. 
Rodger. Just, uh... 
sticking with the batting order.
Rodger, I just want to 
 thank you for all the comfort 
that you've brought into camp. 
It was like having a dad around.
I'm going to hate to see you go.
I'm going to miss you a lot. 
KEITH: 
 You're a really 
 tough competitor, 
and at this stage 
 of the game, it's... 
You're hard to beat. 
I'll go tally the votes. 
Once the votes are tallied, 
 the decision is final. 
The person voted out 
 of the tribe will be 
asked to leave the Tribal 
Council area immediately. 
I'll read the votes. 
First vote. 
Rodger. 
Amber. 
Rodger. 
Amber. 
Two votes Amber, 
two votes Rodger. 
Three votes Amber. 
Last vote. 
Amber. 
You need to bring 
me your torch. 
I'll miss you guys. 
Stay strong. 
Amber, the tribe 
has spoken. 
It's time 
for you to go. 
Well, based on tonight's vote, 
 I guess it's very clear, 
the old tribal lines 
 of Kucha and Ogakor are gone. 
Take your new fire, 
 head back to camp 
and try to get 
a good night's sleep. 
JEFF: 
 Stay tuned for scenes 
 from our next episode 
and hear what Amber has to say.
Next time on Survivor... 
A reward challenge 
 brings messages from home. 
I've got chills 
right now. 
 I can't even contain myself.
Is that a little tear 
in your eye? 
"We miss you and we're 
very proud of you." 
But it's not one happy 
 family back at camp. 
Keith is cooking 
 way too much rice. 
He said the brown rice 
 yields less. 
No, I said you have 
 to use more water. 
The guy's a bozo. 
My game with Keith is done. 
 It's over. 
I don't hold anything 
 against anybody. 
You guys were the best 
 five people I could have 
spent my last couple 
 of nights with. 
I'm actually kind of relieved. 
Those last couple of nights 
 were really, really rough. 
I'm very proud of myself 
 to make it this far, 
and I'm gonna be thinking 
 about you guys a lot. 
You're gonna be 
 in my prayers and thoughts. 
I will never, ever, ever, regret
 anything that's happened here.
