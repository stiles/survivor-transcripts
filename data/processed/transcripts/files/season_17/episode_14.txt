Thank you jeff.

I'M ALMOST 60 YEARS OLD
AND I BEAT OUT EVERYBODY.
LIFE DOESN'T GET
BETTER THAN THIS.
WE ARE BACK WITH THE
WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: GABON."
57 YEARS OLD, THE OLDEST WINNER
EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR GAME.
CONGRATULATIONS, BOB.
CAN YOU WRAP IT UP? 
WHAT WAS THE KEY TO YOU
DOING SO WELL IN THIS GAME?
I JUST TRIED TOE NECESSARY,
TRIED TO BE FRIENDLY.
AND I JUST WAS... 
TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.
YOU ARE OVERWHELMED.
I AM.
- DID YOU-- DID YOU HAVE
- ???
DIDYOU HAVE A GAME PLAN COMING
IN TO TRY AND STAY IN THE DDLE?
MY PLAN WAS TO FLY UNDER THE
RADAR AS LONG AS I COULD.
BE NECESSARY AND 
BE A NICE GUY SO THAT
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE ME.
HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT AMAZING
FAKE IDOL YOU CREATED?
THAT SAVED MY... 
MY PLACE IN THE GAME 
BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE ME OUT, 
AND THEY TRADED IT FOR RANDY.
SORRY, RANDY, BUT....
WE'RE SEEING A LITTLE
FOOTAGE OF IT THERE.
EXPLAIN HOW YOU
MADE THAT IDOL.???
I THINK EVERYBODY THEY
TALKED TO WAS AMAZED.
IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING
WE WOULD HAVE ON THE SHOW.
WHEN-- I GENERALLY COLLECTED BEADS 
WHENEVER THEY FELL ON THE GROUND,
BUT WHEN CORINNE SAID TO ME, 
"WE'RE GOING TO SEND
YOU TO EXILE ISLAND 
I REACHED DOWN, PICKED UP
MY CANTEEN AND MY BAG.
AND YAWNED AND REACHED UP.
AND THERE USED TO BE A WHOLE
BUNCH OF BEADS AND BERRIES 
AND TERRIFICKETS ON THE KOTA FLAG
AND I STRIPPED THEM OFF OFF
AND PUT THEM IN MY POCKET.
??? WHEN I WAS OUT ON
MY LITTLE WALK-ABOUT, 
I FOUND THE BASE OF IT.
AND I JUST SORT OF PUT
IT TOGETHER WITH MY-- 
MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS
GOOD AT ART AND SHE 
LEFT ME A LITTLE TRICK, AND 
I JUST PUT TWO
AND TWO TOGETHER.
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TOOK
A LOT OF GRIEF FOR WAS
THROWING BOB'S BEAUTIFUL
FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL 
IN THE FIRE!
EVERYBODY'S LIKE,
"WHY DID YOU DO THAT?"
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN
SOMEBODY GETS BURNED WITH A FAKE IDOL, 
IN THIS CASE, RANDY,
IT GOES IN THE TORCH.
I DID, HOWEVER,
OFFER GUYS ALL LEFT, 
I DID GO IN AND PULLED OUT
WHAT WAS LEFT --I
FOR YOU, BOB.
I'LL SHOWUE 
CAN WE GET A SHOT
OF THIS, MICHAEL?
THIS IS-- THESE ARE THE PIECES--
BY THE WAY, WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS ROPE?
WE DON'T GIVE YOU GUYS ANYTHING.
I TAKE STUFF.
WRNCHLTS DID YOU GET THE ROPE?
WHEN I GOT TO EXILE ISLAND,
IT WAS THE CLUE-- 
I MEAN, THE INSTRUCTIONS ROLLED UP,
AND IT WAS TIED WITH A PIECE OF STRING,
AND I UNTIED THE STRING
AND PUT IT IN MY POCKET.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
THERE YOU GO.
YOUR SOUVENIR.
Thank you.
WHAT'S THE -- 
BOB, WHAT'S THE REACTION
FROM YOUR-- FROM YOUR STUDENTS?
YOU TEACH PHYSICS IN MAINE.
WHAT ARE THEY-- WHAT DO
THEY THINK. THIS WHOLE THING?
HOW DO YOU RELATE ALL THIS TO...
THE JOKE IS I HAVE THE LARGEST GROUP
OF ILLITTERAL SURVIVOR FANS IN AMERICA.
BUT THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GREAT.
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE,
AND THEY'VE ENJOYED IT.
I GOTTA-- DO YOU-- 
DO YOU -- YOU TOLD ME, ACTUALLY,
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE SOME OF THE
CHALLENGES THAT
YOU'VE DONE SO WELL IN 
AND TURN THEM INTO
PHYSICS PROBLEMS.
I'VE GOTTEN THREETEXT MESSAGES,
"IF YOU DO WELL, MR. CROWLEY, 
DO WE HAVE TO TAKE
THE TEST TOMORROW?
THEY DO.
AND THE LAST QUESTION ON THE TEST-- 
I WON'T GIVE THEM THE
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW-- BUT 
THEY'VE GOT TO CALCULATE
IF IF I THROW A ROCK 
AT 30 DEGREES AT
14 METERS PER SECOND, 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
CALCULATE HOW FAR IF THE--.
THAT'S BASED ON THE CHALLENGE
WHERE YOU THREW BALLS OVER THE--
RIGHT, THREW BECAUSE
OVER THE CLIFF.
SO YOU'RE TAKING THE SHOW, TAKING
IT INT THE CLASSROOM AND SAYING 
LET'S MAKE THIS A PHYSICS PROBLEM.
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, NICE.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE JURY.
IN THA FIRE-MAKE CHALLENGE,
HAD MATTY WON INSTEAD OF BOB 
AND THE FINAL THREE WAS SUGAR,
SUSIE, AND MATTY, 
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE JURY
WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR MATTY?
WOW. ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.
THAT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.
MATTY AND BOB PRACTICED. WHY
WEREN'T YOOUT THERE WORKING THAT?
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT COMING.
I THOUGHT I WAS-- 
I GOT CONFIDENT.
AND WHEN YOU GET CONFIDENT IN
"SURVIVOR," YOU GET IN TROUBLE.
AND I THOUGHT I HAD IT IN THE
BAG, AND, OBVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T.
LET ME JUST SAY-- I'M GOING TO
LOOK RIGHT IN THE CAM RADIO RA-- 
IF YOU END UP ON
THE SHOW "SURVIVOR"" 
GO TO REI BUY A FLINT 
AND PRACTICE MAKING
FIRE A LITTLE BIT 
BAH BAUZ IT COST
MATTY A MILLION BUCKS.
I WAS NEVER VERY
GOOD AT HOMEWORK.
SUSIE, I HAVE ONE
QUESTION FOR YOU, AND 
AS MY FRIEND SAYS,
"WHENEVER YOU SAY WITH-- 
WITH NO DISRESPECT INTENDED"--
IT PROBABLY MEANS THERE IS SOME.
HOW DID YOU GET SO FAR IN THE GAME?
HOW DID YOU GET THREE VOTES
AND NEARLY WIN THIS GAME?
I LIKE TO THINK THAT
PEOPLE LIKED ME.
AND I DID, JUST LIKE BOB,
WAS UNDER THE RADAR.
I WAS A HARD WORKER.
I NEVER WANTED TO
HURT ANYBODY'S FEELINGS.
I've never???
AND I REALLY GOT LUCK
WET TWO IMMUNITIES I WON.
??? THE LAST ONE,
IF I WOULDN'T HAVE WON THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE TO SAY I WAS
SHOCKED AT THE VOTES.
I WAS SHOCKED, TOO.
AS I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
THEM GOING, "ANOTHER SUSIE?
I THOUGHT, IS SHE GOING
TO WIN THIS GAME?
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
TO BLOW YOUR MIND, 
THE DECIDING VOTE
IN TONIGHT'S VOTE 
TURNED OUT TO BE RANDY.
HE WAS THE HUB OF THIS ALL.
RANDY, WHY DID YOU NOT VOTE
FOR SUSIE AND VOTE FOR BOB?
EASY. THAT COOKIE THAT
DIDN'T MATTER MUCH.
THEY KEPT REMINDING ME,
"IT'S JUST A COOKIE."
IT WAS A MILLION-DOLLAR COOKIE.
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT-- 
BECAUSE, SUSIE, YOU GAVE RANDY A HARD
TIME ABOUT THE WHOLE COOKIE INCIDENT.
YEAH, I JUST WAS
DISCUSSING IT WITH HIM--
DISCUSSING?
BOB UPONED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM EXILE, 
AND SUGAR AND RANDY WERE
TRYING TO TELL THEM, AND 
I TOLD MY PERSPECTIVE, I THOUGHT
HE DIDN'T WANT GIVE HIM RAY COOKIE.
??? APPARENTLY HE WAS WRONG.
IT UPSET RANDY. ???
kinda took my head off???
I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE
NEVER GET OUT OF THE SANDBOX.
A CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE NOW
COSTS SUSIE A MILLION DOLLARS.
exactly??? ABSOLUTELY.
SUGAR, 
ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR
PEOPLE ON THIS SEASON...
WHAT HAS BEEN THE
REACTION ON THE STREET?
ARE PEOPLE COMING UP TO YOU?
IS IT HARD TO GO OUT?
YEAH. I'M GETTING A LOT OF
PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME, AND 
SOME PEOPLE ARE THANKING ME
FOR THE RANDY COOKIE INCIDENT. AND 
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD MOOD 
AND HAVE MAKEUP ON BEFORE I LEAVE
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BLOGGING ABOUT 
SEEING ME DRIVING IN MY CAR.
YOU'VE BECOME A SUPERSTAR.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE?
I-- WELL, 
YOU SHOWED MY LICENSE PLATE
PRETTY MUCH TO EVERYBODY, SO, YEAH.
I HAVE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE
WITH MAKEUP ON, THAT'S ALL.
REALLY? THAT'S-- 
I LOST ???-- THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE
FROM "SURVIVOR," THAT YOU'RE now
BASICALLY NEEDING YOUR
OWN PAPARAZZI GUARD.
OH, YEAH.
WHAT-- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE 
RECENT LOSS OF YOUR DAD 
WHILE GOING OUT AND PLAYING THIS
INCREDIBLY TAXING SHOW EMOTIONALLY?
WELL, I THINK PRETTY MUCH
ANYBODY WHO HAS A HEART,
UNDERSTANDS THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I WAS SO EMOTIONAL THE WHOLE TIME.
AND ALL THE STRESS GOING ON, AND
IT WAS A VERY HARD GAME. BUT 
I DON'T CRY EVERY DAY, PEOPLE.
I'M OKAY NOW.
I'M OVER IT.
NOT OVER IT, BUT I'M BETTER.
I'M STRONGER.
THESE GUYS MADE ME STRONGER.
WELL, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
WHILE YOU'RE VERY POPULAR
WITH THE VIEWERS, 
YOU WEREN'T AS POPULAR WITH
SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON THE SHOW.
SUGAR CERTAINLY MADE
????ME COMES IN GABON, 
BUT THIS COMMENT FROM
CORINNE IS ONE OF 
THE NASTIEST COMMENTS
I HAVE EVER HEARD.
SUGAR, YOU ARE AN UNEMPLOYED,
UNEDUCATED LEACH ON SOCIETY 
AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD VOTE TO
GIVE YOU IS A HANDFUL OF ANTI-DEPRESSANTS 
SO IT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE MORE SINCERE
WHEN YOU ARE CRYING YOUR DEAD FATHER.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
DID CORINNE MEAN
WHAT SHE SAID?
DOES SHE REGRET IT?
THAT IS NEXT ON "SURVIVOR: GABON," 
THE REUNION SHOW,
LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
I WOULD RATHER SERVE...
POISON TO THESE PEOPLE.
I DON'T LIKE THE WAYOU'VE
BEEN TALKING NEGATIVE.
SHE'S GOING TO TEACH ME
A LESSON ABOUT LIFE.
I WANT TO KILL SUGAR.
I HATE HER.
I AM GOING TO
BE NASTY AT TRIBAL.
YOU ARE AN UNEMPLOYED,
UNEDUCATED LEACH ON SOCIETY 
AND THE ONLY THING
I WOULD VOTE TO GIVE YOU 
IS A HANDFUL OF ANTI-DEPRESSANTS 
SO IT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE MORE SINCERE
WHEN YOU ARE CRYING YOUR DEAD FATHER.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
CORINNE,
17 SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR."
I HAVE HEARD SOME DOOZIES.
THAT IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
REGRETS ON THAT COMMENT? WHAT--
UHM, 
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN
BUT IT'S LIKE I-- 
OBVIOUSLY, I FEEL
SORRY FOR HER LOSS.
IT WAS MORE THAT THERE ARE SO
MANY DAYS WITH A PERSON CRYING
AND IT'S LIKE BEING STRANDED
IN AFRICA WITH A COLICKY BABY.
I LITERALLY COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.
AND I JUST--.
- I've had enough
- BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO
TAKE IT IS ONE THING.
MAKING A CONSCIOUS DECISION 
TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT SOMEBODY'S--
THE LOSS OF SOMEBODY'S FATHER.
YEAH.
- (thank you)
- UHM, 
I GUESS I JUST HAD A LOT OF ANGER.
AND THOUGHT THIS WILL REALLY,
YOU KNOW, EYE WENT FOR THE GULAR.
IS THAT YOU? IS THAT WHAT
WE SAW OUT THERE?
WELL, I MEAN, IN REAL LIFE,
IF I DIDN'T LIKE SOMEBODY 
I JUST WOULDN'T SPEND
TIME WITH THEM.
BUT IF YOU FORCE ME TO SPEND TIME WITH
SOMEONE YOU WILL PROBABLY PUSH ME TO THAT.
YES, THAT IS ME. THAT IS
NOT AN ACT, THAT'S ME.
So --
NOW, I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT
CORINNE KIND OF LIKES THE BOOS.
I LOVE THE BOOS.
KEEP THEM COMING, PEOPLE.
MARCUS, WHAT'S THE
DISCONNECT BETWEEN 
SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WATCH
THE SHOW LIKING SUGAR, 
AND-- SHE KNOT NO VOTES.
AT THE FINAL.
AND I KNOW THERE'S
ANIMOSITY STILL WITH HER.
WHAT IS IT? CAN YOU PUT
YOUR FINGER ON IT?
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD
TO TELL BECAUSE YOU-- 
YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE ON TV, AND 
THEY SEE ONE MINUTE
OUT OF EVERY 300.
AND I THINK THAT,
LIKE CORINNE SAID, 
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER. WE'RE ALL --
TRYING TO LOVE EACH OTHER, BUT WE ALL
HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPRESSING THAT, 
AND WE ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT
WAYS OF EXPRESSI ANGER.
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,
SUGAR DID A GREAT JOB 
WITH THE MANAGES SHE
WAS DEALING WITH 
BUT A LOT OF TIMES THEY BUBBLED OVER
IN WAYS THAT RUBBED PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY
AND YOU MIGHT NOT SEE THAT ON COMRABUT
THAT IS WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH.
Corrine YOU MENTIONED me earlier today
THAT YOU ARE IRRITATEED WITH US 
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PORTRAY
YOU IN A MORE NEGATIVE LIGHT.
I FELT LIKE FOR THE
FIRST HALF THE SEASON 
I WAS LIKE A WALLFLOWER.
NO ONE KNEW WHO I WAS. ???
I WAS EVERY BIT THE SAME PERSON
FROM DAY ONE AS I WAS UNTIL DAY 33.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT YOUR
COMMENT IS MOST PEOPLE COMPLAIN--
- ABOUT NOT BEING NICE ENOUGH.
- "YOU ONLY SHOWED THE MEAN SIDE.
I'M ACTUALLY A NICE PERSON."
CORINNE CAME TO ME AND SAID,
??? "I'M EVERY BIT AS NASTY AS
RANDY AND YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT."
I WAS LIKE, I LOVED HIS EDIT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO ENTERTAINING.
I LOVED THE EDIT.
YOU'RE TALKING PRODUCTION SPEAK.
WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY?
DO THEY KNOW YOU AS THIS?
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO GET AT.
??? YOU WALK AROUND
LIKE THIS, NO REGRETS?
I DON'T HAVE ANY
REGRETS ABOUT THE SHOW.
TO ME A LOT OF WHAT
I DO IS SARCASM, ???
WHEN I SAID DAN WAS A FORMER
FATTY THAT WAS FUNNY.
I WASN'T ACTUALLY GOING
TO STAB SUSIE IN THE FACE.
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR A KNIFE.
IT'S AN EXAGGERATION.
IT'S AN OUTLET FOR ME.
STAND-UP MAY NOT BE THE
BEST CAREER CHOICE FOR YOU.
I'M GOING TO CONDUCT SENSITIVITY
TRAINING ACROSS AMERICA NOW.
??? ONE KNOWN FOR
HER NASTY COMMENTS.
BITTER OLD RANDY WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF
THE MOST COLORFUL PEOPLE TO PLAY THE GAME.
???
IF YOU GET ME YOU'RE
NOT OFFENDED BY ME.
SASQUATCH IS BIG FOOT
WHICH IS CRYSTAL.
IF YOU DON'T GET ME,
YOU GO CRYING HOME TO MAMMA.
YOU HAVE MADE fang??? IT
A LIVING HELL.
Randy to me, he's
a troll under the bridge
- huh, i'm done
- SHUT THE *** UP.
RANDY IS AN ASS.
HE OFFENDS EVERYONE.
I DON'T LIKE ANY
OF THESE PEOPLE.
I AM THE NEW KING OF GABON SO
I AM GOING TO BURN
THIS HOUSE DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING
IS WE COME OUT TO RANDY, 
AND HE GETS APPLAUSE.
RANDY, SAME QUESTION--
IS THAT YOU?
100%.
SO YOU'RE JUST--
YOU ARE THIS BITTER, BITTER GUY?
WERE YOU ALWAYS THIS WAY?
WHAT MAKES YOU THIS WAY?
NO, I WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY.
I USED TO BE FUN, HAPPY, LIKABLE.
I HAD GIRLFRIENDS.
PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING.
BUT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS.
YEAH. I MEAN... 
YEAH. I HAVEN'T TOLD
A JOKE THIS ENTIRE SEASON.
AND LIFE TOOK A TURN? WHAT-- 
WE-- EVERYONE WANTS TO
GET UNDERNEATH THE VENEER.
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO.
I MEAN, YOU'RE EITHER BORN WITH
THE ABILITY OR YOU'RE NOT.
THE ABILITY TO WHAT?
TO LIKE ME.
THAT WASN'T A JOKE!
THAT WASN'T A JOKE!
AS FURTHER EVIDENCE WHAT
RANDY'S TALKING ABOUT, 
FOR 5 YEARS, BEST FRIEND?
MY DOG 
REALLY? KIND OF
YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND?
YEAH, HE NEVER CHEATED ON ME.
NEVER LIED TO ME.
NEVER CRIED EVERY DAY.
HE WAS AWESOME.
SOMETHING ELSE SURPRISED ME ABOUT
YOU WHEN I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH.
THE HIGHEST I.Q. OF THIS
WHOLE BUNCH WAS MARCUS, 
OFF-THE-CHARTS HIGH.
THE SECOND HIGHEST
I.Q. WAS RANDY.
I THINK THERE'S A PERCEPTION
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE-- 
TO USE A PHRASE THAT MAYBE
IS INAPPROPRIATE-- 
YOU'RE THIS COUNTRY KIND OF
"I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S WHAT."
THERE'S A LOT TO YOU.
THE TEST HAS GOT TO
BE FLAWED BECAUSE...
I MEAN, WITH THESE EINSTEINS
HERE ON THE FRONT ROW....
YOU'RE A COMMERCIAL PILOT?
IS THAT TRUE?
I USED TO BE, YEAH.
YOU RUN IN
IRON MAN IN HAWAII.
I USED TO.
- MARATHONS.
- USED TO.
ENGINEERING DEGREE
FROM VANDERBILT.
I CHEATED.
AND THE BEST PART OF ALL IS 
TELL ME ABOUT WHO YOU
BROUGHT TO THE LIVE SHOW.
OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU COULD BRING.
SIX STRANGERS.
I'VE NEVER MET THEM.
AND HOW DID THIS COME TO BE?
Ur ... THEY'RE FANS OF THE SHOW.
Randy's "friends"
I'VE--, 
YOU KNOW, I JUST KNOW THEM AS FANS, 
AND IT WOULD MEAN SOMETHING
FOR THEM TO COME AND
SOME OF MY OLD FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL
AND COLLEGE WOULD LOVE TO BE HERE BUT 
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THE
SHOW UNTIL I GOT ON IT.
YEAH, SO THEY'RE OUT THERE,
SOMEBODY, I DON'T KNOW.
RANDY, YOU APPLIED TO
BE ON SHOULD FOE 15 TIMES.
WORTH THE WAIT?
NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED
UNTIL ABOUT SEASON 22.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT FUNNIER
AND A LOT MIDDLE EASTERN.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,
RANDY'S CAREER IS--
APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH--
A WEDDING VIDEOGRAPHER.
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE HIRED RANDY
IN THE PAST TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING VIDEOS, 
THIS IS THE MAN BEHIND THEM.
IT WAS A PLEASURE-- ODDLY, IT WAS
A PLEASURE HAVING YOU ON THE SHOWS.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST
DESPICABLE AND LIKABLE PEOPLE
THAT WE'VE EVER HAD.
- THANK YOU.
- CHARLIE...
YES.
CHARLIE, MY QUESTION TO YOU IS 
YOU ARE ONE OF THE NICEST GUYS
WE'VE EVER HAD ON THE SHOW.
YOU'RE NICE THROUGH AND THROUGH,
AND YOU WERE FRIENDS
WITH THESE GUYS.
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?
CORINNE IS ONE OF THE NASTIEST PEOPLE
I'VE EVER MET, AND YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH HER.
I WAS FRIENDS WITH
ALL THESE GUYS HERE, 
BUT I WAS PARTICULARLY
FWRENDZ THESE TWO.
WHAT IS IT THOUGH? YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO
SAW SOMETHING A LOT OF US DIDN'T SEE.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN
RANDY AND WHAT PEOPLE LIKE IN RANDY 
I ALSO SEE IN CORINNE.
THEY ALSO PUT UP THIS WALL SORT OF-- 
THIS EMOTIONAL WALL, BUT THERE IS
A BIG HEART BEHIND BOTH OF THEM.
THEY'RE BOTH WILDLY SMART
PEOPLE INTERESTING PEOPLE.
IF YOU RESPECT THEM,
THEY RESPECT YOU BACK.
I WAS BORN TO LOVE RANDY AND
I WAS BORN TO LOVE CORINNE AND 
WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.
Alright, UP next 
Is CRYSTAL REALLY
AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST?
AND THE ACCENT THAT HAS
SO MANY PEOPLE CURIOUS, 
ACE, IS IT REAL OR FAKE?
PLUS THE MOST UNDERESTIMATED
PLAYER IN THE GAME, KENNY, 
AND LATER, SPRINT IS AWARDING $100,000
TO THE SPRINT PLAYER OF THE SEASON.
BUT FIRST, TAKING US TO THE BREAK, 
OUR TWO COMPOSERS DAVID
VANNACOR AND RUSS LANDAU.
I AM A 2004 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST.
I'm gonna???
Yeah, this ???
CRYSTAL TAKES A HARD HIT.
CRYSTAL REALLY STRUGGLING FOR FANG.
CRYSTAL ONCE AGAIN
OFF THE COURSE.
CRYSTAL BACK ON THE COURSE.
I WAS IN THE GAME.
CRYSTAL IN THE WATER FIRST.
I JUST WASN'T PARTICIPATING
AS MH AS I NORMALLY DO.
THIS CHALLENGE IS
NATIONALLY UNDER WAY.
AND AFTER ONE SECOND,
CRYSTAL IS OUT.
CRYSTAL, YOU TALK ABOUT
HAVING A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.
WHEN YOU COME ON TO THIS SHOW
BILLED AS AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST
IN A SHOW FILLED WITH CHALLENGES,
UGE EXPECTING AS.
BUT I GOTTA SAY, 
NEXT TO WHETHER OR
NOT ACE'S ACCENT IS REAL, 
THE MOST-ASKED QUESTION IS,
"CRYSTAL? REALLY,
SHE'S AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST?"
CAN WE SEE SOME PROOF?
YES, YOU SURE KJEFF.
I AM AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, OKAY.
HERE'S MY MEDAL.
FROM THE 2004 GAMES.
I WAS A MEMBER OF THE 4 X 4
RELAY WHICH WON GOLD.
WE'RE LOOK AT A SHOT
OF YOU RIGHT THERE.
- SO YOU ARE LEGITIMIZED.
THEN THE NEXT QUESTION,
- YES.
"WHAT HAPPENED?"
YOU'RE AN ATHLETE.
YOU COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING OUT THERE.
I KNOW. OH, JEFF,
THOSE CHALLENGES WERE SO HARD.
I AM BUILT TO RUN AROUND A CIRCLE.
I AM NOT BUILT TO RUN ON LORKZ RUN UPHIL 
SWIM-- I AM NOT A FISH.
??Aye a runner, a horse, a Gazelle.
??Those challenges they are hard.
Did any of your friends From the olympics
call you and Say,
??"what is going on?"
??I have one of my closest
Friends here tonight
and she's An olympic medalist
and called Me up all the time,
cristable, You suck."??
Yes.
What about people on the Street?
Are they more or less forgiving?
They are--
They are actually More forgiving.
??They're like put aside the wle
Athletic side of the side.
??They said, "crystal, we love
how You just tell eb autopsy,"
so That made up for it.??
Dan, you took a lot of Grief out there.
??It was probably a surprise to You
??when you watched the show And saw
what people were saying About you.
How do you deal with that?
??You're kind of vulnerable
on the Show?
You're absolutely vulnerable In a way
that you don't have in Your everyday life.
You're taken away from your
Inner security circle.
I think you just have to
Remember who you are,
and that's Really all that matters.
And if you can remember who you Are
and you're confident about Who you are,
i think every Decision you make on a
Day-To-Day basis??
- ??is the Important thing.
- ??
You got a round of Applause for that.
Kenny,
gamer.
This is the thing i want to Know.
Educate me about gaming
because You were bill as a world-Class,
World champion gamer.
What is that--
Give me some Credentials?
Basically, i would travel Around the
world and then play These tournaments,
??
and, you know
There are tournaments where...
There's a chance for me to Travel,
play video games and get Some money.
I've got some sponsors,
and i Was able to make more
than $50,000 doing that for...
??Started playing games
when i was A kid.
But, you know,
i figured i could Make a career
out of it prayer While and??
- support me through College--.
- You're so charge.??
- You just go on ask and on.
- ??
??I like it. I just didn't know
who you were Talking to.
??
What's the connection between
Playing those games and "Survivor,"
if there is one?
Well, in the gaming community
I'm nope for my thing--
My thing Called mind games,
and i kind of Put that to the "survivor,"
just Like to be able to
manipulate Players
and try to make them do
What i want them to do.
And vote my way.
And i think that--
It did kind Of help a bit.
What was your downfall In this game?
definitely i got cocky.
I was like-- I thought
i was the Hub of the world.
I thought, hey, i'm in charge.
I thought it was a chess game.
You do this, you do that.
But no.
??Not everyone on "survivor" is
a Piece i can move.
They had their own head.
They had their own mind.
When i got cocky,
that was Definitely my downfall.
I thought i could run the game.
But once you get that
choke in "Survivor"--
??I'm a big fan, so...
Everyone who ever got cocky and
Thought they could run the game
??Thought it was--
It was a Downfall for them.
Love life update.
??When you came on the show
you Said i haven't had a girlfriend
In years, years.
??Has anything changed?
Well, i've talked to some Girls lately.
??
I mean, yeah, girls are actually
Finding me attractive,
which is Kind of weird.
But...
i mean, i want someone
Who likes me for me
and not Because i was on "survivor."
Well, okay...
then what About beautiful michelle
with Whom you guys had a little
Something there, michelle.
You think i'm beautiful?
- Thank you, jeff!
- Michelle,
any chance With you and kenny?
You guys in your first--
In your Only episode,
had a nice little Moment
where you ate a termite For him.
??
Now i have nightmares that This
big termite is trying to Meet me??
and he's wearing a Fang--
What do you call those Things-- A buff.
He is wearing a fang buff
and He's chasing me
because i ate His daughter.??
Kenny,
maybe stay Single.
??
???
??I agree.
- We love you, michelle.
- I know.
Ace,
you've got to get This all the time.
But i want to put an end to it--
The accent.
Some people said it was Inconsistent
thus raising the Suspicion
maybe it was not real.
??
???
??I am from mississippi.
??
??I was raised in london.
??My parents are english
and i Lived there for eight years.
So my accent sort of stuck.
Do you think something
As simple as an accent
??could Have affected nu this game?
Completely.
I think in retrospect i should Have--
??I have the worst Impression of
an american accent Possible,
but i should have
Faked an american accent
and had An english accent
in Confessional.
??
???
??
Gabon was not easy
and It would have been a lot tougher
Without the help of
the gabonese?? Government,
and they are here Tonight.
We want to thank them because
They made this whole season Possible.
Thank you, guys.
