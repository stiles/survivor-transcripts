        PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR:
18 AMERICANS EMBARKED ON A JOURNEY TO ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS OF AFRICA.
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR: GABON,"
EARTH'S LAST EDEN.
THE DIVERSE GROUP INCLUDED A HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS TEACHER,
A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP VIDEO GAME PLAYER, AND AN OLYMPIC ATHLETE.
I AM A 2004 GOLD MEDALIST IN THE WOMEN'S 4 X 400 METER RELAY.
AS THEY SPLIT INTO TWO TRIBES ACE AND SUGAR CONNECTED right off the bat.
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR A PHOTOGRAPHER NOT TO HAVE A MODEL.
Sugar please.
THE TRIBES WERE CALLED Fang in red AND Kota wearing yellow.
go
THEY IMMEDIATELY RACED FOR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AND EXTRA FOOD.








Marcus has the idol for Kota, for Fong GC grabs the idol.
FANG LOST THE CHALLENGE BY A LANDSLIDE.
KOTA WINS CORN AND BEANS!
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, KOTA WAS A TRIBE THAT COULD DO NO wrong.
OUR MORAL WAS SUPER HIGH.
WE'RE ALL EXCITED.
WE LOVE OUR TEAM.
THE YELLOW TRIBE WAS IN PERFECT HARMONY.
I FELT A LITTLE YOGA WOULD really GET our THE ENERGY FLOWING,
THE CHAKRAS WOULD BE ALL IN TIME.
ALMOST.
ACE IS KIND OF GETTING ON MY NERVES.
KOTA'S SMALLEST TRIBE MATE Paloma WAS making waves.
Ace GETTING ON MY NERVES. He does not shut up.
KOTA'S PROBLEMS SEEM INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO FANG'S.
AFTER ONLY SIX DAYS,
THE RED TRIBE WAS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE WORST TRIBES IN SURVIVOR HISTORY.
THIS TRIBE IS HOPELESS.








THEY'RE IDIOTS.
THEY LOST AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE BADLY AND VOTED OUT ONE OF THEIR BEST ATHLETES.
THEY SELECTED A TRIBE LEADER, GC.
,AND HE QUIT NEXT DAY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A LEADER.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU ALL FORCE Me TO BE A LEADER.
********FANG IS FALLING BEHIND!
THEY LOST YET ANOTHER IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND THEN FINALLY THEY DID SOMETHING
THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER-- THEY MADE A UNIFIED DECISION.
THEY UNANIMOUSLY VOTED OUT THEIR OLDEST AND WEAKEST PLAYER.
GILLIAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
BUMMER.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER NIGHT.
Hell, YEAH, MAN, WHATEVER HAPPENS WE MADE IT ANOTHER NIGHT YOU GUYS.
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A NO-BRAINER.
GILLIAN, YOU GOT TO GO.
WE GOT RID OF A MAJOR PHYSICAL WEAK LINK.
TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE A NEW DAY.
WE GOT TO WIN TOMORROW, WE HAVE TO.
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S PHYSICAL OR WHATEVER--
BRING IT ON.
YOU OKAY?
I WOULD LIKE TO START WINNING BUT THE TRIBE THAT I HAVE,
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE.
ARE YOU TRYING TO BREAK THAT?
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY'RE STUPID.
I REALLY SHOULDN'T BLAME THEM FOR BEING COMPLETE IDIOTS, BUT THEY ARE.
THEY DON'T KNOW IT, BUT THEY ARE.
Survivor
Season17 Episode02
MAN, WE?RE GETTING CRACKING OUT HERE
IT'S DAY SEVEN, AND WE'RE OVER HALFWAY FINISHED WITH OUR RICE.
SOMEONE HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA OF THREE MEALS A DAY.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS "SURVIVOR".
THREE MEALS A DAY?
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE RUNNING LOW ON RICE.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT.
IT'S NOT MAYBE.
THAT'S A FACT.
I MEAN, I LOVE THREE MEALS A DAY BUT CAN WE COMPROMISE AT TWO?
TWO MEALS A DAY?
I CAN.
I'M FINE WITH TWO.
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST THINK--
EVERYBODY WAS EATING SO MUCH AT FIRST,
I REMEMBER THROWING AWAY A HALF A POT OF RICE THE FIRST DAY.
THAT WASTED SO MUCH OF OUR RICE.
AND NOW I'M SUFFERING BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CHOSE TO DO THAT EARLY ON.
I'M NOT SUFFERING.
I AM.
IN MY OPINION, THE CANCER IN THE TRIBE IS GC..
HE CANNOT BE TOLD ANYTHING.
AND OUR TRIBE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS UNTIL THAT CANCER IS EXCISED.
RANDY, ARE YOU LIKE THE LEADER OF THE TRIBE NOW?
NO, WE?RE JUST SITTING HERE TALKING DUDE.
IF YOU WANT TO START,
WE'LL START IT.
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE LATELY, LIKE THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO STEP UP INTO THE LEADERSHIP ROLE.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
BUT YOU SURE ARE JUMPY ABOUT IT.
WE DECIDED THIS TRIBE DOESN'T NEED A LEADER.
WHAT'S THE POINT?
ARE YOU ASKING ME IF I WANT TO BE A LEADER?
THE ANSWER IS NO.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYBODY more.
DROP IT.
I DON'T HAVE TO DROP NOTHING MAN.
I CAN ASK YOU SOMETHING IF I WANT.
I CAN IGNORE YOU THEN.
YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU WANT.
I THINK IF WE PULLED TOGETHER AS A TEAM
WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE IF WE WERE MORE UNIFIED AND THINKING OF THIS
AS A TEAM RATHER THAN FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER.
OH, MY GOD!
A FISH.
IT'S AMAZING.
MY ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW IS WITH MARCUS, CORINNE AND JACQUIE.
Beyond that I think Paloma and Kelly are really tight,
and SUGAR IS ATTACHED TO ACE.
AND I DEFINITELY THINK BOB IS WOO ABLE, AND CAN BE USED AS A SWING VOTE.
SO THERE IS ALWAYS THE CONCERN THAT THE OTHER FIVE MIGHT BOND TOGETHER,
BUT I THINK THE OTHER FIVE ARE SO ALL OVER THE PLACE,
THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP THE FOUR TOGETHER.
I don?t like Ace.
IT'S HIS WAY OR NO WAY.
LIKE, RIGHT NOW HE?S, LIKE THE KING, AND EVERYBODY IS BOWING DOWN TO HIM.
I JUST WANT TO GAG EVERY TIME HE opens HIS MOUTH.
I KNOW.
SO THEY'RE CONNIVING OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.
EVERYBODY'S GETTING COMPLICATED NOW.
I KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING FOR A LITTLE BIT,
BUT I ALREADY KNOW WHO I LIKE THE BEST SO.
FOR SOME REASON, ME AND ACE DECIDED WE HAD SOME KIND OF CONNECTION.
I TRUST ACE, AND I BELIEVE THAT HE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ME AS MUCH AS HE CAN.
YOU GUYS!
TREE MAIL!
OKAY, READY?
"THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE REQUIRES A WELL-BALANCED TEAM.
To win some camp comfort you?ll kick and you?ll scream "TOTALLY BEDDING?.
Yeah, I know. It's not Immunity.
We're sleeping.
We've got food.
WE'VE GOT WATER.
I mean, it?s still important. We want to win.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GOING TO SAY LET'S THROW THE CHALLENGE
BUT I'M SAYING I'D RATHER WE PUT OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE STRONGER TODAY
SO WE HAVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRONGER FOR THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
BECAUSE I CAN LIVE WITHOUT BEDDING. BUT I'D RATHER NOT GO TO TRIBAL.
GOOD POINT.
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO ADORE ACE AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY IS BOWING DOWN TO HIM.
THEY THINK HE'S THE King.
I CAN SEE THROUGH IT SO I'M NOT BLINDED BY IT.
JUST FROM TALKING TO KELLY, I KNOW SHE HAS THE SAME FRUSTRATION.
WE BOTH ARE OVER HIM.
COME ON IN, GUYS!
KOTA GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW FANG TRIBE,
GILLIAN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE.
YES. ABSOLUTELY.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONE MEMBER OF EACH TRIBE WILL BE STATIONED AT A POST.
ON MY GO, TWO MEMBERS OF THE OTHER TRIBE WILL RACE OUT
AND ATTEMPT to REMOVE YOU FROM THAT POST AND DRAG YOU THROUGH THE SAND TO THE FINISH.
FIRST Tribe TO GET THE MEMBER OF THE OTHER TRIBE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE SCORES A POINT.
ONE NOTE-- PLAYERS CAN SWAP POSITIONS EACH ROUND.
FIRST TRIBE TO SCORE TWO POINTS WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

THIS MATCH LOOKS A LITTLE MORE UNEVEN WITH CRYSTAL AND RANDY ON THE VERY SMALL PALOMA.
THIS COULD BE OVER QUICKLY.
YOU'RE DONE!
YOU'RE DONE.
RANDY AND CRYSTAL HAVE Paloma OFF THE POST VERY FAST.
THEY'RE DRAGGING HER UP THE HILL.
WE'RE TIED,1-1.
YEAH!
GOOD STUFF!
*******
ALL RIGHT, WE ARE TIED,1-1.
WE'RE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MATCH-UP, ACE AND DAN ON THE POLES.
THE ATTACKERS ARE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.
MARCUS AND BOB ATTACKING FOR KOTA.
AND CRYSTAL AND MATTY ARE THE ATTACKERS FOR FANG.
THIS IS A FINAL ROUND.
PLAYING FOR REWARD.
KOTA WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE FANG DOES NOT TASTE VICTORY.
FANG IS DESPERATE FOR A VICTORY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS IS IT, RIGHT HERE.
YOU NEED TO DIG DEEP LIKE YOU'VE NEVER DUG BEFORE.
DAN HOLDING ON TIGHT AGAINST MARCUS AND BOB.

CRYSTAL, WE NEED TO YOU WIN!
MATTY HAS THE TOP HALF OF ACE OFF OF THE POST.
CRYSTAL WORKS ON THE LEGS.

WHO'S GOT MORE WILL?
YOU GOT TO CROSS THE LINE.
FANG WINS REWARD!
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FANG!
FANG, CONGRATULATIONS.
CRYSTAL, YOU LOOK VERY EMOTIONAL.
WE HAD TO GO OUT HERE AND FIGHT LIKE WARRIORS
IN ORDER TO GET SOME BLANKETS AND SOME COMFORT,
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.
FANG, BIG DECISION TO MAKE.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SEND FROM KOTA TO GO TO EXILE ISLAND?
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH SOMEONE SWEET, SO WE'RE GOING TO PICK SUGAR.
I KNEW THAT HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO PICK ME
BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M DUMB BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME YET.
THE BAD NEWS, SUGAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE AWAY FROM CAMP. And as You know THAT'S NEVER A GOOD THING.
I KNOW.
GOOD NEWS is, waiting for you on Exile. A CLUE TO the location of the HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
GOT YOUR STUFF?
MAP TO EXILE.
KOTA, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
ALL RIGHT, FANG, NICE JOB.
GET YOUR REWARD.
HEAD ON OUT.
GOOD JOB.
THAT CHALLENGE FELT SO GOOD.
IT FELT GOOD FOR THE OTHER TRIBE TO FEEL THE PAIN
THAT WE HAVE BEEN FEELING. TO WALK AWAY with YOUR HEADS DOWN.
HOW AWESOME IS IT TO COME BACK WINNING?
YOU HELD ON.
THE REASON I HELD ON SO LONG IS BECAUSE I GOT MY ENERGY FROM MATTY AND FROM YOU.
COMING BACK INTO CAMP, WE WERE FEELING LIKE A TEAM,
FINALLY FEELING LIKE WE'RE GOING TO START CREATING A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLL HERE
I WAS LOSING IT AND YOU HEARD ME YELLING.
COME ON!
WE DID WELL.
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IT WASN'T A LOSS.
- IT WAS A STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL.
- YOU GUYS DID AWESOME.
WE MOVED OUR FORCES BACK IN PERFECT RETREAT WHICH WAS THE POINT.
WE DID TAKE OUR STRONGEST GIRLS.
IT WAS A GREAT DECISION.
THAT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT STRATEGY.
IT'S HARD WHEN, LIKE, THEIR THREE STRONGEST AND ONE OF THE THEM WAS THE GIRL.
I was like a rag doll.
CRYSTAL, WHICH IS ON THEIR TEAM, IS HUGE, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO ME.
LIKE, I'M THE SHORTEST PERSON ALIVE,
SO COMPARED TO CRYSTAL, LIKE, I MEAN, I JUST HAD NO CHANCE.
IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD THAT,
LIKE, ACE DECIDED TO PUT ME ON THE POLE INSTEAD OF SUGAR,
BUT, LIKE WITH ACE, IT'S KIND OF LIKE IT'S HIS WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.
WE SHOULD HAVE PUT KELLY IN INSTEAD OF PALOMA.
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE SAT THE THREE OF YOU GUYS OUT.
PALOMA HAD TO GO IN.
PUT HER IN FOR A PUZZLE OR SOMETHING.
WHAT IF IT WASN'T A PUZZLE.
WE'LL BE FINE.
It was still frustrating.
SUGAR DID WELL.
IT'S NOT FINE--
WE CAN CATCH FISH FOR TONIGHT AND KEEP THE TRAPS AND DO ALL THE OTHER STUFF.
WE'RE JUST STUCK WITH PALOMA.
IT WAS A BIT HARD, YOU KNOW, WATCHING PALOMA JUST GIVE UP.
YEAH, I THINK HER LACK OF.
MOTIVATION, LET'S SAY, JUST SORT OF SEALED WHAT WE WERE ALL THINKING ALREADY.
SORT OF CROSSED AND DOTTED THE T ON HER CONTRACT OF DEATH.
So WHATEVER.
"IN THIS GARDEN OF EDEN A DIFFICULT CHOICE YOU WILL FACE.
ONE CHOICE PROVIDES AN APPLE.
ONE CHOICE PROVIDES direction.
" GETTING IN THAT CAGE AND HAVING COMFORT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE,
BUT IT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY STUPID BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE,
SINCE I'M ONLY THE SECOND PERSON SENT TO EXILE ISLAND,
THAT THE IDOL IS STILL OUT THERE.
"ACROSS THE LAKE YOU SEE SO WELL THERE LIES A SANDY CRATER.
THE OBJECT HIDDEN IN ITS FLOOR WILL SURELY HELP YOU LATER
IT'S LIKE I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A JUNGLE.
NO PROBLEM.
OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS NOT MY NORMAL THING, OBVIOUSLY.
I'M NOT A CAMPER.
I DON'T LIKE TO BE DIRTY.
I THINK I'VE GONE TOO FAR.
THIS TIME, I'VE GONE TOO FAR.
I'M LOST.
I DID SURVIVOR""
BECAUSE I" THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP ME GROW UP A LITTLE BIT AND GET A THICKER SKIN,
AND GET OVER-- NOT GET OVER, BUT DEAL WITH.
MY FATHER'S DEATH-- I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY SEVEN MONTHS AGO.
I'M TRYING TO-- TRYING TO KEEP IT TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN I STAY IN SURVIVAL MODE,
THEN I DON'T GET LIKE THIS.
I'M SURE I'LL BE A STRONGER PERSON BY THE END OF IT ALL,
PLAYING THIS GAME WILL HELP ME AT THIS TIME IN MY LIFE.
OH, THANK GOD!
THIS IS DEFINITELY A SANDY CRATER.
THE ONLY CLUE, IT'S HIDDEN IN THIS FREAKING'' DIRT.
HOLY.
OH, MY GOD.
DID I FIND.
THE THING?
OR IS THIS A JOKE?
"NOW TURN AROUND, GO BACK TOWARDS THE LAKE,
ON ONE TREE HILL CLIMB FOR SALVATION'S	SAKE.
" WHAT?
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE ONE TREE.
MAYBE I'LL.
START WITH THIS ONE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME, BUT I'M LEARNING REALLY QUICK.
MY CONFIDENCE IS BUILT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH EACH NEW THING I DO.
I'M A LOT TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT I WAS.
"WALK ALONG A YONDER CREEK,
BENEATH THE BURNED WOOD IS THE THING YOU SEEK.
" I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY.
I'M NOT SEEING ANY BURNT WOOD.
IS THIS THE BURNT WOOD?
I THINK I FOUND BURNT WOOD.
OKAY, COOL.
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH THIS.
THROUGH CREATURES UNKNOWN YOU'LL HAVE TO WADE AMONG THE LIMBS
THAT REACH SKYWARD YOUR DELIVERANCE SHALL BE MADE.
HOPEFULLY THE IDOL, RIGHT, NOT ANOTHER CLUE.
OH, LORDY, LORDY, LOWERED.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WADE IN THE WATER.
I HAVE A FEELING IT'S OVER HERE
BIG OLD TREE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WATER.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.
OH, LORDY.
I'M GOING OVER TO THAT TREE.
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD HIDING SPOTS.
THIS IS VERY SCARY.
CAUSE THERE'S GIANT LIZARDS OR SOMETHING IN THERE.
ALL RIGHT, I?M GOING IN.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS SO SCARY!
OH, MY GOD I FOUND IT!
OKAY, GOOD.
THANK GOD.
WHEN FANG SENT ME TO EXILE I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY THOUGHT I WAS DUMB,
AND THAT I'D NEVER FIND THE IDOL NO WAY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND IT AND THE LAWYER DIDN'T.
HOW FUNNY IS THAT?
THAT'S FUNNY.
BUT MY DAD'S BEEN WITH ME THIS WHOLE TIME SO I FEEL LIKE HE'S BEEN HELPING ME.
HE'S HERE.
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.
YOU WERE AWESOME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Those are the two I flip flopping with.
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE SUGAR.
I LIKE Sugar?s PERSON.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S LOYAL.
AND LOYALTY STANDS A LOT FOR THIS GAME.
- YOU KNOW THAT.
- YEAH.
I THINK WE CAN TRUST SUGAR LONGER THAN WE CAN PALOMA.
ACE IS PUTTING HIMSELF ARE AT RISK BY DOING THIS MANIPULATION.
BY CALLING OUT Paloma HE'S PROTECTING SUGAR BIG-TIME.
HE WANTS TO KEEP SUGAR.
I CAN SEE WHY.
IF SHE MAKES IT TO THE JURY, SHE WILL VOTE FOR HIM.
BUT THAT CAN IRRITATE PEOPLE.
THAT WORRIES PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.
IT WILL DEFINITELY BE PALOMA AND THEN SUGAR.
OR SUGAR AND THEN PALOMA.
THEY'RE GOING.
HE'S DOING SOMETHING VERY STUPID.
HE'S BRINGING SUGAR TO THE END BECAUSE SHE'S WEAK.
SHE NEEDS HIM.
I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH, I HAVE JACQUIE, MARCUS, CHARLIE.
WE'RE ALL IN YOUR BOOK AS LONG AS, YOU KNOW,
YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY WE DO, WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
YEAH.
AND THERE ARE FIVE OF US.
SO WE CAN PICK WHOEVER WE WANT.
WE ARE IN THE MAJORITY.
I THINK BOB RESPONDS REALLY WELL TO BOLD, CONFIDENT MOVES.
WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO HIM, I HAD TO SPEAK TO HIM LIKE HERE'S THE DEAL.
THESE ARE THE FOUR.
YOU'RE THE FIFTH.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.
YOU'RE THE MAJORITY.
WE'RE GETTING RID OF THIS ONE, THAT'S IT.
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE WE'RE FIVE.
SO LOCK IT DOWN.
THAT'S IT.
GOOD POINT.
NONE OF US IS LOOKING TO TAKE BOB TO THE END.
HOWEVER, WE NEED HIM FOR NUMBERS AND I THINK WE CAN TRUST HIM.
"SLIP, SLIDE, SPLASH AND RUN.
THE Stakes ARE HIGH, BUT YOU'LL HAVE SOME FUN.
WHO IS BRIGHT AND WHO IS SLOW?
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE OR BE THE NEXT TO GO.
I THINK THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IS THE MOST CRUCIAL ONE THAT WE'VE HAD TO THIS POINT.
THEIR ONE VICTORY HAS GIVEN THEM SOME HOPE.
CRUSHING THAT HOPE IS GOING TO SEND THEM TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF DESPAIR.
COME ON IN, GUYS!
WE'LL NOW BRING IN SUGAR, RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND.
HEY, BABE.
- 
- I KNOW.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DIDN'T SEND YOU.
IT'S A GAME.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
YEAH.
FIRST THINGS FIRST I WILL TAKE IT BACK AGAIN.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONE AT A TIME,
YOU WILL LAUNCH YOURSELF DOWN A SLIPPERY SLIDE AND INTO THE WATER.
YOU'LL THEN SWIM OUT TO RETRIEVE A COVERED NUMBER TILE AND RACE BACK.
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL SIX TILES,
THE REMAINING TRIBE MEMBER WILL USE THOSE NUMBERED TILES TO SOLVE A MATH PUZZLE.
THE ANSWER WILL REVEAL THE COMBINATION TO A CHEST.
FIRST TRIBE TO OPEN THEIR CHEST,& RAISE THEIR TRIBE FLAG WINS IMMUNITY.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE GOING HOME.
KOTA, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA MEMBERS.
WHO'S GOING TO SIT OUT THIS ONE?
PALOMA AND SUGAR.
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, BOB AND KEN ARE WAITING TO Solve the PUZZLE.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING DOWN THE SLIDE.
FOR IMMUNITY? SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
IT'S CRISTAL AND KELLY FIRST DOWN.
KELLY DOES IT PERFECTLY.
CRYSTAL TAKES A HARD HIT.
BOTH ARE IN THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME.
CRYSTAL'S TALL ENOUGH SHE CAN ACTUALLY RUN TO GET HER FIRST PUZZLE PIECE.
COME ON, KELLY!
KELLY COMING BACK.
RUN!
CRYSTAL OUT OF THE WATER FIRST FOR FANG.
RUN, CRYSTAL, RUN!
SUSIE ON THE COURSE.
FANG WITH A GOOD-SIZED LEAD RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
CORINNE HITS THE COURSE.
THAT WAS AWESOME.
SUSIE HAS THE SECOND PIECE TO THIS PUZZLE.
CORINNE QUICKLY GETS HER NUMBER.
SHE'S HEADING BACK, MAKING UP A LOT OF TIME ON SUSIE.
FANG HAS LOST ALL OF THEIR LEAD NOW.
CHARLIE ON THE COURSE FOR KOTA.
KOTA NOW HAS THE LEAD.
GC ON THE COURSE FOR FANG.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
CHARLIE OUT OF THE WATER, HEADING BACK FEBRUARY KOTA.
KOTA HAS THREE tiles BACK.
FANG STILL WITH TWO.
KOTA STILL WITH A GOOD-SIZED LEAD.
RANDY ON THE COURSE FOR FANG.
COME on RANDY!
Jacquie out of the water for Kota. TWO NUMBERS LEFT.
ACE FLIPS OVER TWICE.
RANDY NEEDS TO PICK IT UP.
FANG HAS LOST MORE TIME.
DAN ON THE COURSE FOR FANG.
STILL LOOKING TO WIN THAT FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
ACE HOLDING ON TO KOTA'S LEAD.
KOTA HAS ONE NUMBER LEFT IN THE WATER.
FANG HAS TWO MORE LEFT.
A BIG LAWN.
MARCUS HEADING OUT FOR THAT SIXTH AND FINAL NUMBER FOR KOTA.
DAN FINALLY OUT OF THE WATER FOR FANG.
MATTY'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP A LOT OF TIME.
MARCUS OUT OF THE WATER WITH THE SIXTH AND FINAL NUMBER FOR KOTA.
IT'S NOW UP TO BOB TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.
OKAY, BOB! YOU CAN DO IT!
MATTY OUT OF THE WATER WITH THAT SIXTH AND FINAL NUMBER.
GO, KEN!
KEN RACING NOW TRYING TO CATCH UP.
GOT A PHYSICS TEACHER GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH A VIDEO GAME EXPERT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A MATH MAJOR TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
YOU JUST NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE.
READ IT CAREFULLY, REARRANGE THE NUMBERS.
THE SUM OF BOTH END VALUES WILL EQUAL THE SUM OF THE MIDDLE TWO.
THE LAST NUMBER IS EQUAL TO THE SECOND, MINUS THE THIRD,
AND IS ONE LESS THAN THE ONE BEFORE IT.
DO IT!
TRY IT!
BOB THINKS HE MIGHT HAVE IT.
MAKE THOSE NUMBERS INTO A COMBINATION.
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, THE CHEST WILL OPEN.
NO, HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.
KEN THINKS HE HAS IT.
KEN TRIES IT.
HE'S NOT RIGHT.
TRY TO LOOK AT THIS PUZZLE AGAIN.
MAYBE YOU'RE PUTTING A COMMA WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG OR READING A WORD WRONG.
OH, THEN VALUE.
BOB THINKS HE MIGHT HAVE FIGURED IT OUT SUDDENLY.
KEN THINKS HE HAS IT AGAIN.
I DO,TOO.
BOB THINKS HE HAS IT.
BOTH TRIBES TRYING IT.
EITHER ONE OF THESE GUYS ARE RIGHT, IMMUNITY FOR THEIR TRIBE.
PULL THE DAMN HANDLE, BOB!
BOB TRIES IT.
HE'S WRONG, ONCE AGAIN.
KEN HAS IT RIGHT FOR FANG.
FANG WINS IMMUNITY!
FANG, CONGRATULATIONS.
BACK-TO-BACK WINS.
THIS TIME FOR IMMUNITY.
THIS GAME IS CHANGING.
KOTA, DATE WITH ME TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE THE THIRD PERSON WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP, I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
FANG, YOU GUYS GOING TO MISS ME AT TRIBAL COUNCIL?
YOU NEED TO GET TO KNOW THEM A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
GRAB YOUR STUFF. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
Right.
BUT THE CLUES ARE NOT FREAKING EASY.
I HAD TO FIND MY WAY TO big desert.
SPOT WITH THIS MAP.
AND I READ IT WRONG OR SOMETHING.
I THINK I PLAYED OFF THE FACT THEY FOUND THE IDOL PRETTY WELL.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS A CLUE THAT I GOT IT.
I'M NOT TOO BAD AT THIS.
I'M A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT, FOR SURE.
I FOUND IT.
THAT'S GREAT.
SO I CAN HANG ON TO THIS thing FOR A WHILE, MAYBE.
HANG ON TO IT.
OBVIOUSLY, DON'T BRING IT TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.
BUT BRING IT TO TRIBAL GENERALLY.
I JUST HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION IN THE CANOE,
BEING TOLD SUGAR HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL AND WE'RE GOING TO HOPEFULLY DOMINATE THIS GAME.
PALOMA TONIGHT.
PALOMA'S DEAD.
YEAH, OKAY.
KELLY'S PRETTY DEAD AFTER THAT.
AWESOME.
I'M PRETTY EXCITED.
NOW WE'RE ALL PREPPING FOR THE COUPE DE GRACE,
BEING TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND THE DISMISSAL OF LITTLE MISS PALOMA.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
STRATEGICALLY, I'M, LIKE, THE ANIMALS OUT IN THE WILDS.
I JUST WATCH, JUST WATCH, AND THEN I'M GOING TO POUNCE ON SOMEONE AND EAT THEM UP.
Has ACE MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH YOU YET?
HE'S MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE?
HE HAS.
HE'S NOT SAID ONE WORD TO ME.
HE HASN'T SAID ONE TO ME BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.
HE'S TRYING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO GET RID OF ME,
LIKE PUTTING ME ON THE POLE INSTEAD OF SUGAR.
THINK ABOUT IT.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET RID OF SUGAR, ACE DOESN'T WANT TO.
AND ACE IS PRETTY MUCH RUNNING THE GAME.
KEEP YOUR EYES OUT BECAUSE HE'S SNEAKY.
I WILL SAY WHAT I NEED TO SAY REALLY FAST TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK
AND GET THEIR BRAINS GOING AND MAKE THEM ALL CRAZY AND THINKING.
ACE MIGHT BE STRONG AS AN OX,
AND I MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS A MOUSE BUT WE'RE BOTH 50-50.
PEOPLE WANT HIM OUT BECAUSE HE'S STRONG.
PEOPLE MIGHT WANT ME OUT BECAUSE I'M WEAK.
HE'S NOT RUNNING THE SHOW, PALOMA.
PERSONALLY, I DON'T CARE.
I CAN'T STAND THE GUY.
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN THINK OF.
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.
I REALLY CAN'T STAND Ace.
I'M NOT SURE THE ACCENT IS REAL.
I THINK HE'S A CON ARTIST.
I WOULD LIKE IT SEE HIM GO HOME SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.
I AM AFRAID IF ACE GOES WITH US TO THE MERGE HE WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO FLIP.
Because he is on the outskirt of our alliance.
SHE TRIED ME TO GET INTO THE ALLIANCE WITH HER.
SHE SAID ACE IS REALLY DANGEROUS.
AND SHE SAID HE FORCED MY TO GO ON THE POST SO EVERYONE COULD SEE HOW BAD I WAS.
SHE SAID EVERYONE KNEW--
I THINK THAT COULD BE PARTLY TRUE.
IT'S 100% TRUE.
AFTERWARDS, HE SAID, DID YOU SEE--
TWO SECONDS, LIKE THIS.
NOT EVEN.
IT'S A PROBLEM.
HE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE THE EMERGENCY BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
YOU'RE SMART AT THIS GAME.
THERE DEFINITELY SAY SHORT-TERM BENEFIT Getting RID OF OUR WEAKEST PLAYERS
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN TROUNCE THE OTHER TEAM AND NOT HAVE TO VOTE OFF OTHER PEOPLE.
BUT ACE IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE ACE HAS BEEN PLAYING SUGAR LIKE A PAWN.
I'M TAKING HER TO THE END BECAUSE SHE'S EASY.
SHE FOLLOWS WHAT I SAY.
THEY'RE GOING TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS AT THE END.
GETTING RID OF PALOMA, WHATEVER, THAT CAN BE DONE LATER.
YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ACE EARLIER BEFORE HE GAINS MOMENTUM BEFORE WE MERGE.
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT.
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY.
I DISLIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ON THIS DAMN TRIBE THAT IT'S LIKE, IT?S A TOSS-UP.
BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A TORCH.
GRAB YOUR TORCH, APPROACH YOUR FLAME, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL COUNCIL.
IN THIS GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE, YOU ARE STILL IN THE GAME.
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE YOU.
SO FINALLY, WE GET A CHANCE TO TALK.
SO, CORINNE, FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL WHAT, DO YOU BASE THE VOTE ON?
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN OPINION OF WHO SHOULD BE VOTED OUT,
BUT THE IDEA IS YOU WANT ONE OPINION TOGETHER
SO THAT THAT YOU HAVE AS LITTLE DISSENSION AMONG THE GROUP AS POSSIBLE.
ACE, THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLY PIE IN THE SKY
"LET'S COME TO ONE GROUP CONSENSUS ON WHO WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT?"
I THINK THIS EARLY IN THE GAME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT STRENGTHENS THE TRIBE
AND MAKES US STRONGER FOR CHALLENGES.
SUGAR, LET'S TALK ABOUT EXILE ISLAND.
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE ALONE THIS EARLY IN THE GAME.
WHAT DO YOU DRAW ON?
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT MY DAD.
DAMN IT.
JUST BECAUSE I LOST MY DAD RECENTLY, AND.
AND.
IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH.
I MISS EVERYONE.
MARCUS, THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO PLAY IN REGARDS TO THE IDOL.
ONE IS DON'T TRY TO FLUSH IT OUT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT.
THE OTHER IS, I'VE GOT IT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I THINK SUGAR'S CHOOSING, IF SHE DOES HAVE IT,
TO LET HER OUTSIDE REFLECT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE INSIDES,
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE ,MORE POWER TO HER.
IT'S PROBABLY THE WAY I WOULD PLAY IT MYSELF.
WHEN YOU GOT WITH THIS GROUP, WHO JUMPED OUT AT YOU AS, WOW, INTERESTING.
I THINK OUR TRIBE ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE,
BUT ACE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING GUY FROM THE START,
AND HE AND I SEEM TO WORK WELL TOGETHER AND HAVE A LOT OF SIMILAR IDEA IDEAS.
PALOMA, DID ACE STAND OUT TO YOU AS HAVING A BIG PERSONALITY?
YEAH, DEFINITELY, ACE IS LIKE THE HEAD HONCHO AT OUR CAMPSITE.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT, HIM BEING THE BIG GUY?
I MEAN, LIKE, HE CAN BE THE BIG GUY ALL HE WANTS.
I REALLY COULD CARE LESS.
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO THERE.
NOT EVEN GOING TO GO WHERE?
DO THE WHOLE LIKE, ACE IS MY HERO TYPE THING.
SO ACE IS CLEARLY NOT YOUR HERO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
ACE, DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT?
NOT PARTICULARLY.
I THINK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RUB EACH OTHER THE WRONG WAY.
KELLY, DO YOU THINK ACE IS AN ASSET TO YOUR TRIBE?
UM, IN SOME CASES BECAUSE HE'S ALMOST CONDESCENDING IN A WAY.
HOW IS CONDESCENDING A GOOD THING?
IT'S NOT A GOOD THING AT ALL SOMETIMES.
SAY WE'RE COOKING RICE OR SOMETHING, HE'LL BE LIKE,
"OH,I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO MAKE WATER.
" IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE RICE, LET US MAKE RICE.
WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED WATER RIGHT NOW.
ACE, CONCERNED at ALL THAT YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE COMING UP SAYING,
"BY THE WAY, I GOT TWO VOTES.
OF COURSE, YOU CAN NEVER WALK INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL WITHOUT BEING SCARED.
HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS BAG WITH HIM SO HE CAN'T BE THAT WORRIED.
THERE'S NOTHING I REALLY WANT TO TAKE FROM CAMP.
THINK YOU GUYS might been BROTHER-SISTER IN ANOTHER LIFE?
MAYBE, IN ANOTHER WORLD,1,000 YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN I'M DEAD.
ALL RIGHT, MARCUS, YOU HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL AROUND YOUR NECK.
IT IS ONLY GOOD AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
YOU CAN, OBVIOUSLY, ASSIGN IT TO SOMEBODY
IF YOU WANT OR MAKE SURE ARE YOU SAFE AND KEEP IT.
I THINK I'M GOING TO HANG ON TO IT THIS TIME.
TONIGHT, MARCUS IS SAFE.
EVERYBODY else IS FAIR GAME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
KELLY, YOU'RE UP.
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH SELF-EXPLANATORY.
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE LEAVING.
IT'S FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE TRIBE.
BEST OF LUCK.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL.
COUNCIL ARE IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, PALOMA.
ACE.
ONE VOTE PALOMA, ONE VOTE ACE.
ACE.
TWO VOTES ACE, ONE VOTE PALOMA.
PALOMA.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES PALOMA, TWO VOTES ACE.
PALOMA.
THREE VOTES PALOMA, TWO VOTES ACE.
PALOMA. THAT?S FOUR VOTES PALOMA, TWO VOTES ACE.
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF SURVIVOR: GABON, PALOMA.
THAT'S FIVE. THAT?S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
PALOMA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
WELL, THE TRUTH IS, YOU?VE LOST BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.
AND NOW YOUR FIRST TRIBE MEMBER.
FANG CLEARLY HAS THE MOMENTUM.
QUESTION IS, CAN YOU GET IT BACK?
GRAB YOUR TORCHES. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
