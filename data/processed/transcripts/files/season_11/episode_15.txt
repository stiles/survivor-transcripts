 JEFF PROBST: Inside this
envelope is a huge advantage at
the next immunity challenge.
 200.
 PROBST: 200 to Danni.
Sold for 200 to Danni.
 "Switch positions with any
player."
I'm gonna switch with Steph.
 PROBST: Steph doesn't like








it, Steph is out.
Danni wins immunity.
 Money well spent.
 PROBST: Money well spent.
Nothing more valuable than this
right now.
 Oh, I love this thing.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Welcome to the
Survivor: Guatemala reunion
show.
We have all 18 of the folks
from Survivor: Guatemala.
Gonna check in with everybody








tonight, starting with you,
Danni.
We showed that clip of you
buying the immunity advantage.
On day 31, you paid 200 bucks
for that, it saves you from
getting voted out.
Eight days later, it's a million
dollars.
With my map, that's a 500,000%
return on investment.
But seriously, that was critical
for you, right?
You were gone that night.
 Yes. No, that was definitely
the best move for me in that
game.
Um, gosh, this is just
unbelievable.
It's overwhelming.
That was money well spent,
that's for sure, because, uh,
you know, at this point in the
game it was all puzzles, and I
am terrible at puzzles.
My family knows-- anything
that's physical, I'm fine, but,
um... So I knew I was gonna
need a clue.
 PROBST: Aside from buying
that, what was the best move you
made strategically in terms of
who to vote out or who to keep
in.
 Uh, probably at the end with
Rafe, strategically, um, getting
him out at the end, um, 'cause
Rafe was, you know, very well-
liked, and, uh, you know, it's
something I still deal with
today 'cause he's such an
awesome guy, but we're were to
win the game, so...
 PROBST: Rafe, you had...
You made a deal.
You were going to the final two.
What was it that made you give
it up?
Was it really what you said
about honor, or were you
influenced by Stephenie and her
effort and crying and all that?
 You know, I was definitely
influenced by Steph and her
effort, but I really wanted
Danni to make a decision that
she'd look back now, look back
five years from now, and be
proud of the decision she made.
I thought it would be to take me
to the final two, but, you know,
it wasn't, and that's okay,
'cause I wanted her to make what
she would be proud of.
 PROBST: Danni, I think you
had mentioned to me at one point
that you... the minute you
realized this was going to be an
endurance, once everybody made
it to the sort of leaning
position, you started panicking,
thinking, "What am I going to
do? I can't take Rafe."
 Yeah, I did.
Um, when I was up there in that
final immunity challenge, I kept
thinking about my family, and I
have a huge family, and I just
knew I could bless them so much,
you know, if I won the million
dollars and I started thinking
about them, because if I came
back and I hadn't made that
move, they would have killed me.
I mean, they would have had my
head on the chopping block.
And it's so funny.
I kind of like to think of
myself as, like, a Stealth
bomber.
Like, in this game, I don't
think anybody... I never flew
under the radar, I think they
just... I beat their radar.
Like, they didn't know I was
coming until after I dropped the
bombs on them.
 PROBST: Gary, that's a good
point she makes.
Was Danni... That's one of the
questions I had.
I never really saw Danni playing
the game until late.
Was she just underrated?
 I don't think she was
underrated at all.
I just think she just had a
smile on her face, she was
honest, she worked hard and, um,
you know, it got her where she
is at and that's awesome.
 PROBST: Rafe, going back to
giving up this immunity, because
it seemed to me many times
throughout the game, you were
morally conflicted.
"Should I? I could.
I can't eat the chicken," which
is a whole other topic.
( laughter )
And then you give back what
might have been a million
dollars.
We'll never know what happened,
because you didn't get a chance
to go to final two and make your
case.
Could have been a million dollar
give back.
Was that the hardest part of the
game for you, the moral
decisions?
 Definitely. You know, I was
looking at myself on day 38, as
I watched Steph up there, and I
watched Danni up there, and I
was thinking, "I truly am proud
of every decision."
I made some hard decisions to
get people out, and, you know, I
was proud of it at the end, and
I didn't want to, on day 38,
throw that away just to try and
win.
I wanted to make a decision for
that Tribal Council, too, that I
was also proud of.
 PROBST: Surprised a little at
how well you did physically?
Four individual immunity wins.
Pretty good.
 Uh, you know, I don't think
anyone here ever expected me to
do well, and that's what I went
in... you know, I was, like, "I
believe in myself and I don't
care what everyone else thinks.
I'm going to come out here and
every competition I go into, I'm
going to give it my best, I'm
going to try to win it."
Um, I think people did
underestimate me the whole game
out here, and I used it to my
advantage.
 PROBST: Lydia, I'm going to
ask you the question that I
asked you, bless your heart, at
almost every Tribal Council.
Sooner or later, I would say
"Lydia, how are you still in
this game?"
( laughter )
 Well, Jeff, you know, um, I
came in this game with a
different kind of strategy, and,
uh, first and foremost, you
know, being a mom, you know?
Nurturing, compassion, you know,
that plays a big key in
everybody, you know, for me to
show everybody.
But, uh, you know, also,
although I'm not real athletic,
you know, I was here as a
provider, and I think I did my
job well providing everybody
food, my vote, water, a clean
camp and a smile and motivation.
 PROBST: Well, and there's
something to be said for that.
( cheering and applause )
Your attitude, in what was the
toughest season we have done,
your attitude was remarkable.
Day after day, Lydia would show
up and have, she would have a
smile on her face, in light of
everything else.
 Right, and I just want to let
everybody know, a positive
attitude and a good heart and
kindred spirit, you know, will
take you far.
 PROBST: All right.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: We're gonna take a
quick break.
Up next, we're gonna talk to
Bobby Jon and Stephenie-- two
people who returned to play a
second time, and in spite of
big targets, played very well.
Plus, we're gonna hear from one
Survivor who was never afraid
to speak his mind.
We'll be right back.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Guatemala live
reunion show.
One of the big twists to this
season was inviting back
Stephenie and Bobby Jon to play
for a second time, and the
appealing part of the dilemma
was they had to decide, those of
you in the game, do we get rid
of these two guys who've already
played or do we keep them around
for their knowledge?
Steph, so coming in, you know
you're gonna have a target on
your back.
How did that impact how you
played this game from day one?
 Well, for me coming in, it
was pretty difficult because it
was like, well, I'm probably
not gonna get past first
Council, first of all, so I'm
gonna have to obviously do
everything I can to try to get
sort of far.
So the first thing in my mind is
I'm gonna have to take a
leadership role.
I can't sit back, I'm definitely
going, and make a good alliance,
and I did.
I made a major alliance with
Rafe and a few other people and
it got me all the way to the
end.
 PROBST: Were you worried,
because in Palau, the first time
you played, you were sort of the
sweetheart and everybody loved
Stephenie and how she played.
Well, that's hard, that
expectation is hard to live up
to a second time.
Did it go through your head, "I
might be risking the way people
see me if I play a tougher
game?"
 Um, absolutely.
I mean, I guess I did come off
as America's sweetheart, but
also, coming into Guatemala, I
wasn't playing for seventh
place.
So I knew that I had to play
hard, and I'm the same person I
was on Palau.
I mean, you may have seen a
different side of me, that's me.
Take them both, mash them
together, get a common
denominator, I don't know what.
But, you know, I am who I am,
I'm a nice person, but I had to
make some tough decisions and,
you know, I hurt a few people
along the way.
But it's Survivor, and if you
want to get to the end, you
gotta play hard and I did.
I'm really proud of it.
 PROBST: Did you think, going
to the end, that you could win?
Because, as you said, as far as
Judd, Jamie and Cindy are
concerned, you're yesterday's
news, you know?
You-You cut their throats.
That's three of the four votes
Danni needs to win.
 Yeah. I actually...
I came into the game and
I thought I had a great chance
of winning, and then as I'm
playing the game, and kind of
some of the reactions I got from
a few people, I was, like, "Wait
a minute, I got a second chance.
If I get to the end, no one's
gonna vote for me."
So I kind of thought, "Maybe I
definitely won't win the game,
so their best strategy was
probably to take me to the end
because they're definitely gonna
win against me," but at the same
time, Rafe and I played the same
game, the same game.
I may have come off a little
differently, but we played the
same game.
And he prob... He may have won.
I mean, you never know, but he
may have won.
That's why Danni took me.
It was a good move.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Another element of
having both Bobby Jon and Steph
was there was a sense of star
struck, especially in the
beginning, for some of you.
Not for everybody.
Amy's shaking her head, hell no.
But Cindy, without question, you
even said at one of the
challenges, you said, "Part of
the reason I am on this show is
Stephenie."
 That is part of the reason,
but I wasn't star struck.
I was inspired seeing her do
what she did in Palau, and
seeing similarities in herself
and myself, knowing that if she
can do that, I can do it, and
maybe better.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Fair enough. Gary...
I know from talking to you, you
sensed even more than just
inspiration.
You sensed a bit of, "Wow,
that's Stephenie and Bobby Jon."
And how did that impact the game
from you as a new player
playing?
 Well, I am a big Survivor
fan.
And Stephenie was one of my
favorites, and so was Bobby Jon
in Palau.
And, uh, I think they used it to
their advantage, and that's
smart playing, so you got to
give them credit.
 PROBST: Okay, but I'm not
gonna let you off the hook.
( laughter )
I want to hear the truth, which
is, you've told me before that
you think it did impact the
game, because, for awhile,
people were kind of, like, "It's
just cool to be around these two
people.
 There's no doubt, um...
People were asking them question
after question, and, you know,
Stephenie was just giving
answers, and it was, uh...
People were looking up to her.
She was on TV for how long in
the previous season, and there's
no doubt that there was some
people that, uh, were really,
really glad she was there.
 PROBST: Well, I have to say,
Steph, in two seasons, you
definitely set a couple of
records.
46 challenges you took part in.
You won ten, you lost 36 times.
( laughter )
On the flip side, you survived
enough to make it through 25
Tribal Councils.
Now, you got voted out twice,
but it really does say a lot for
how well you played this game,
because it's tough to survive
that many votes.
So, hats off to you for that.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Now, you had a, you
had a bond with Judd that seemed
very tight, and when Judd was
voted out, it was a blind side,
and it led to one of the best
exit lines I think we've ever
had.
Remember this?
13th person voted out of
Survivor: Guatemala... Judd.
 Thanks, guys.
Hope you guys all get bit by a
freaking crocodile.
Scum bags.
( cheering and applause )
 Brutally honest, right?
Brutally honest.
 PROBST: You say you're
brutally honest.
 Brutally honest.
 PROBST: Yeah, you were every
single day, brutally honest.
What is the relationship between
you and Steph?
'Cause that night it was not, it
was not good.
 Oh, Steph's awesome.
I mean, you know, I was, nobody
hates to lose, so...
There's nothing fun about
losing, so I was pretty PO'd.
She's still a good girl.
She played hard, so...
 PROBST: What's been the
perception...
because you're a doorman in a
big city where you meet a lot of
people every day-- what's been
the reaction from people?
Do they recognize you, and
what's their take on how you
played?
 Yeah, no, they look at me and
they say, "Holy cow, that's the
big fat dude from Survivor."
( laughter )
"That's him, man, that's him.
I'm telling you."
 PROBST: So you're okay,
because a lot of people would
say you are a villain this
season, and you're okay with
that-- that's Judd.
 Yeah, like I said, brutally
honest.
You know, I said it the way it
was and I got no regrets
whatsoever.
 PROBST: Is it...?
( cheering and applause )
That's a good way to play this
game, for sure.
What's the status with
Margaret?
Because, I got to say, I've been
through a lot of Tribal
Councils, I've never seen
anybody stand up and do the
speech you did to Margaret about
ADD and all that stuff.
( laughter )
 You know what, that was just
part of my strategy.
( laughter )
What can I tell you?
No hard feelings, Margaret,
whatsoever.
No hard feelings whatsoever.
 PROBST: One thing I have to
clear up, Judd-- you did lie in
this game.
( cheering and applause )
Because even after, even after
we outted you for lying about
the idol, when you got voted out
in your confessional you said,
"I don't know, I mean, I never
lied."
I'm looking at the TV going,
"Who is this guy?"
 Yeah, but, you know, the
night before I lied... the night
before I lied, I kind of had a
big party and, you know, was
still a little...
going into the next day.
 PROBST: This is what it's
like in Tribal Council, it's...
 I felt like Santa Claus and I
said it's on the ground.
Bobby Jon said if I told him it
was in the water he would have
jumped in the water.
 PROBST: Speaking of Bobby
Jon, Bobby Jon also big target
on your back, you come into
this game as one of the
toughest, one of the strongest
guys, and on day one, eyes
rolling in the back of your
head.
That trek obviously surprised
even you, a guy built for this
game in a lot of ways.
 Right. No, it did.
It beat me right down on my
back.
I mean, I felt helpless,
embarrassed.
Um, it pretty much humbled me in
more ways than one, I think.
 PROBST: Did you come in also
with a different strategy?
Because I know at the end of
Palau, it seemed like you were
starting to realize there's some
strategy to how you play people
in the game.
 Well, you got to mash the gas
in order for the car to go, you
know?
And that's the whole thing about
this game.
If you don't think that you
can... If you think you can just
work and be nice and be sweet
and go through this game and not
get voted out, that's not going
to happen.
 PROBST: What was it you said
just now? You have to what?"
 Uh, something about mashing
the gas in the car.
I don't know.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: What's great about...
What's great about you, Bobby
Jon, is still after how many
people played this game, you
have to be one of the most
authentic and endearing guys to
ever be on here.
 Well, thank you.
 PROBST: And yet, sometimes
that authenticity explodes to
the guy next to you.
 Right.
 PROBST: Before we get to
that, I have to say, watching
you two guys from the South go
at it, was, I mean, sometimes
it was heated, but it was
always entertaining.
I just want to remind you kind
of what it was like.
Take a look at this.
 Oh! Who's smiling now?!
 Whoa!
 Yes!
 Alabama, Georgia kind of have
rivals.
( indistinct screaming )
 PROBST: Nakum scores!
 Just shut up, dude.
I mean, God.
( cheering and applause )
( shouting )
 PROBST: So, Jamie, obviously,
uh, the status of the friendship
is fine at this point.
 It's good to know there's
still some good ol' country boys
around.
I love this kid.
Love him.
 PROBST: Were you really
losing your mind out there?
( laughter )
 I heard there was a vote
tonight, I almost didn't come.
I was a little paranoid.
Promise you won't vote for me?
Don't you lie to me, Rafe.
Rafe!
 PROBST: Because, you know,
that...
That seemed to be a real reason
that people voted you out, is
they thought, as Rafe said, "He
won't quit asking me if I'm
going to vote him out.
I'm getting tired of him.
I'm going to vote him out."
Once you were voted out, did you
have a period where you
realized, I think I was,
seriously, kind of losing it
out there?
 I was definitely losing it a
little bit out there.
I'll admit that, you know, but,
you know, I was also, I was a
competitor also, so it goes both
ways.
Um, I think, uh, I was just
losing it a little bit and it
happened, what happens.
They played a game and they got
me.
 PROBST: All right.
Well, up next, Gary said he
never played in the NFL, but
Danni knew better.
How did she know?
Plus, which Survivor wishes she
was still living in the jungles
of Guatemala?
We'll get her story after this.
( cheering and applause )
 Who'd you think I was?
 Oh, I thought you played at
Central Michigan.
I don't know, maybe he just
doesn't want anybody to know he
was a former professional
quarterback.
 I'll call the locals over
there.
Can you give me the lowdown on
Mr. Gary Hawkins,
ex-professional football player?
 "Ex-professional foot..."
Yeah, I wish.
 If you are, and I find out
after, I am going to beat you
down.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Guatemala reunion
show.
Now, the whole...
( indistinct shouting )
All right.
The whole need for that lie
actually started because Danni
recognizes you ten minutes into
the show.
How did you know who Hogeboom
was?
 Well, I, um, I work in sports
radio back in Kansas City for
Sports Radio 610.
And, um, I'm a huge sports
fanatic, but I don't...
I wouldn't have recognized him
if it hadn't been for growing up
with seven brothers and a dad
who's a Cowboys fan, um, just
seeing pictures around of him,
'cause when we were casting for,
uh, the show, I was, like, he
looks familiar.
At first I thought that he
looked like Brett Favre, and,
um, I went back and was, like,
"Gosh, I recognize him."
And then, um, then Central...
He went to Central Michigan
State, and you go up there, and
there's, like, a shrine of Gary
there at Central Michigan State,
so it was kind of funny.
It was kind of ironic.
 PROBST: And you ended up at
Central Michigan State on a lark
going to see a game.
 Yeah, we just were up there.
 PROBST: So, Gary, you show
up, this is your worst
nightmare.
She spotted you three different
times already.
 Yeah, it really was.
I didn't expect anybody to spot
me just 'cause of the age
differences and everything, but
I figured I had to go in with a
different name just to get as
far as I could in the game, but
it shocked me, it really did.
 PROBST: So you had the alter
ego plan from day one anyway.
 Yes, I did.
 PROBST: And did you hear from
any of your NFL buddies?
 You know, they were just...
they just wanted to know what
the heck I was doing on the
show.
"What are you doing, man?"
I said, "I love the show."
 PROBST: Amy, so, you're
suspicious the whole time.
 Yep.
 PROBST: And then you finally
find out, what was the reaction?
Did you call Gary?
What happened?
 Oh, you have no idea.
I wanted to beat him down, baby!
We're cool, though.
We're cool, but I know where he
lives in Grand Haven.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Okay, you are a
Detective Sergeant in the Major
Crime...
 Revere P.D., in the Major
Crime Unit.
What's up, Revere P.D.?
I got to say hello.
 PROBST: So what's the
reaction?
Do people recognize you?
 Yes, every time I go to lock
up a bad guy, they're like,
"Hey, weren't you on Survivor?"
I'm, like, "Listen, buddy,
you're under arrest."
( laughter )
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: By the way, for a
second here, let's just
acknowledge some real changes in
appearance starting with you,
Amy, you look fantastic.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: You lost a lot of
weight out there.
 Thanks, guys. Thank you.
 PROBST: And at the other end,
Judd, how much did you lose?
 45 pounds.
 PROBST: 45 pounds.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Well, for all of the
pain and suffering of this show,
Cindy, you enjoyed this so much,
you still wish... Is this true?
That you still wish you were
living in the jungles of
Guatemala?
 Yeah, I do wish...
I mean I go to sleep at night,
I try to go to sleep at night,
and I close my eyes and I
constantly imagine the sounds of
the jungle and imagine what the
ground felt like and the smell
of the fire.
 PROBST: You know people think
you're slightly nuts for
thinking this.
 I know they do, but anybody
that knows me very well at all,
knows that that is really Cindy.
I felt like I left a part of who
I am in the Guatemalan jungle,
and when I left for Tribal
Council that night, I thought,
"I might go home tonight," and I
really felt like I was leaving
home and I was never going to
get to come back.
 PROBST: And you actually lost
your job to be on this show when
you went for your first meeting
with us.
 I did lose my job, and that
was my other home.
The two things that people know
about me within the first five
minutes of meeting me was she
wants to be on Survivor and she
loves her job at the zoo.
It's the two things everybody
knew, so, I mean, I lost my job
at the zoo to pursue the dream
of Survivor, and then when I
left that night thinking it
might be my last night, I
thought, "Okay, well this one's
over, too," and I just, I feel
like that those...
A part of me is gone, and I felt
like I left home and I was never
going to get to come back.
 PROBST: Which begs a big
question-- you had a rare
opportunity with this car curse.
So everybody that has won that
challenge in 11 seasons has
never went on to win the game.
We gave you a chance not only to
quote-unquote get rid of the
curse, whatever that is, but
also to give four other people a
car.
Rafe, do you think if she had
made a different decision, would
it have kept her in until the
final four?
 You know, it's hard to say
what you would have done at that
time, 'cause you're not in that
situation.
I would have thought maybe it
would have, but if we'd been
there and we voted her out, she
would have lost everything, so
you know, she did get the car
and she has a Pontiac and she
can drive to Guatemala in it.
( laughter )
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Speaking of going
back to Guatemala...
Margaret up in the
top row, you had such a good
experience and connected so much
with Guatemala, I heard that you
are actually going back there to
do some relief work.
 Jeff, I am. I'm very excited.
Um, Frances Payne Bolton School
of Nursing at Case Western is
teaming up with me and I'm going
back with Brian Corridan and
we're leading a group of
university students to help in
the relief effort.
Um, after we left Guatemala, the
mud slides devastated them and
buried, um, hundreds of people
alive, so we're excited about
going back.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: And also to your
credit, those first few days we
actually monitored a lot of what
was going on out there through
your interviews with the show,
because it was like triage for
those first few days, and, uh,
you had Blake in your lap
several times trying to keep him
going.
Aw...
Now, Blake, in spite... you
know, you had a couple of things
going on out there.
One, you were the guy that was
going to be the strong guy and
all this, and that was changed
right away, but the part that I
kind of remember, take the joy
of, is, uh, Golden Boy, the term
that everybody gave you.
 I gave him.
 Amy, you want to field this
one?
 I gave him this, but go
ahead.
 PROBST: Well, because you
said that, we kind of covered
that about, that everything he
touches sort of...
 Turns to gold.
 PROBST: Yeah, question I have
is this-- when you described
your girlfriend...
For those people who saw that
episode, you went into great
detail about your girlfriend,
and I just wondered what was her
reaction when you are sitting at
home watching that with her?
 You know, she laughed.
Um, she knows me and loves me
very much and knows how I feel
about her, and, um...
Actually, the funnier part was
when her father called me and
said I can't believe my
daughter's breasts got you
kicked off Survivor.
( laughter )
 PROBST: All right, on that
note this was without a doubt
the toughest season we've ever
done, and we're gonna hear a
little more about that when we
return.
Plus updates from a few other
people up here.
But first, here's a clip that
you didn't see on the show.
This is the moment that helped
keep Gary alive when he found
the hidden immunity idol.
 I've been looking in the
ceiba tree... well, lo and
behold, I see the idol.
This is highly secretive.
I'm going to keep it till I need
it, which could be tonight.
 PROBST: Your first challenge,
it is a grueling 11-mile race
through the jungles of
Guatemala.
( hacking )
 Judd, you okay back there?
 These big strong guys, strong
as oxes, and they are all down.
 I have open, festering sores
and it sucks.
( applause and cheering )
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Guatemala reunion
show.
Brandon, that was your shoulder
we were looking at at the end.
When you see that, what goes
through your head?
When you try to describe what
that 11-mile trek through a
dense jungle was like, how do
you do it?
 I don't know.
It's pretty indescribable.
I mean, 11 miles through thick
jungle, carrying bags of corn.
I mean, it explains itself.
It is really, really difficult.
 PROBST: Ever done anything
that compares to that?
 You know, I did a little
hiking in Montana over the
mountains and everything, but
nothing like that, you know, I
mean it was really tough.
 PROBST: You seem, also like
Rafe, a little bit, that the
tough part of this game for you
was the moral compass.
At a certain point, you decided
there are certain things I am
going to do and certain things I
will not do.
Would you play the game
differently now that you see it
is just a game, or was that your
line?
 No, I think I'd play the game
the same pretty much.
You know, I mean that is how I
went into the game, wanting to
play a really strong, clean
game, but the game really brings
out, I mean, a lot of ugliness.
It's a... it's a really mean
game, you know?
( laughter )
I tried to bring a little bit of
light and, uh, you know, do
good.
 PROBST: I think you did.
I think your attitude did bring
some light.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Jim... Jim, you come
into this game with a lot of
years of experience in different
areas, certainly in the fire
department, and then early on
you, you know, you have a freak
accident.
Can three days in still feel
like the Survivor experience
when you are a guy like you?
 Absolutely, no doubt about
it.
Living in those Mayan ruins, I'd
do the whole thing again just to
do that, just to live where
people, you know, haven't lived
for 3,000 years.
But the arm's doing good and I'm
going to Disneyland, so...
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Brian, on the other
corner, when we met you, about
being on this show, you were,
"I'm the greatest student of the
game, Jeff.
There's no one that can outfox
me, I can do anything.
Let me tell you."
As a student of the game...
 You, you rock.
I can't even say it.
I'll just wait. Go ahead.
 PROBST: No, you were on the
show because you were fantastic,
and you did know the game, and
you did seem to have a very good
understanding of strategy.
What didn't you anticipate?
 You know, luck is a huge,
huge part of the game, and when
you were, like, "Oh, who's
got the most tribe pride?" and
then, "Oh, Brian, okay.
Well, screw you, you're in the
minority."
You know? And I'm like, "Okay."
So, you know, luck is just a
huge part of the game, and you
really need to go into this game
wanting to win, playing hard,
but being okay with the luck
factor, you know?
And of course, I could have
overcome it, I think, if I had
made stronger bonds with Gary
and Amy, but fact of the matter
is, my game really changed when
I was swapped over, when I
stayed in Yaxha.
So, you know, you have to be
okay with luck playing a factor.
 PROBST: And I give you a hard
time and I'm not picking on you.
You really were delightful to
have on the show, because you're
so well-spoken.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: And are you a good
strategist.
You maneuvered, you helped get
Blake out of the game, no doubt
about it.
Blake's not buying it.
 That was all Danni right
there.
 It was Danni.
Danni won and she deserved it,
you know?
 PROBST: Yeah, on the other
end, Brooke... You get, right
away, you're leading this tribe
through the jungle.
You sort of got labeled, it
sounded like anyway, as the
smart person.
Is that something that can hurt
you in this game?
Is that really why you were
voted out, is because people saw
you early on as a threat?
 Um, I think in some ways,
like, my first original team
appreciated me because I was
smart, because I used the
compass, things like that, you
know, and it was funny that,
like, Brandon got labeled as the
farm boy, but here I'd grown up
on a farm my entire life.
You know, law school is just the
last three years of my life, but
no one ever called me a farm
girl once.
And then when I got on my new
team, um, I think Jamie, Judd
and Stephenie just said, "Oh,
law girl's got to go.
She's not the athletic one, so
we're gonna get her out of
here."
 PROBST: Brianna.
( cheering )
 PROBST: All right, couple of
"yeahs."
Simply, to me watching, this
game seemed to overwhelm you.
That was my take, am I wrong?
 No, you're not wrong at all.
Actually, it was very
overwhelming, it was
extremely... I mean, it was
brutal, I'm not going to lie.
And I still don't know what a
pick is and I don't really care.
( laughter )
 PROBST: But did you have fun?
Did you have a good time?
 I had a great time.
I had a really awesome time.
My friends at the Seattle
Supersonics are definitely
teaching me some things, though.
 PROBST: Morgan, same
question, you were...
It surprised me that you got
voted off so early.
 It surprised me, too.
( laughter )
 PROBST: And I still wonder,
is it... is there-- because some
people are so competitive-- that
six days that you lasted would
not be enough.
They'd say, "You know, I didn't
even get my feet wet."
 You know, everything happens
for... it wasn't enough, but
everything does happen for a
reason, and my experience,
getting voted off, kind of made
it all worth it.
But I never expected myself to
do as well physically.
And so, I thought that I was
doing so good in this game, and,
you know, like they said, you
can't just be nice and win this
game, and I tried...
 PROBST: And yet, all you can
really be in this game is who
you are, ultimately, which is
why...
 And that's why I have no
regrets, because I was true to
myself, and I really impressed
myself, so I just have to be
proud with that.
 PROBST: Well, you guys gave
us a great season in a very,
very tough situation.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Tomorrow morning on
The Early Show, here on CBS,
Danni is going to get a check
for a million dollars.
And also, as part of the prize
for winning Survivor: Guatemala,
she wins a 2006 Pontiac Torrent.
Take a look at your ride.
And as this season comes to a
close, a new season is just
around the corner.
We'll tell you all about it when
we come right back.
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Well, as Survivor:
Guatemala comes to a close,
there's a brand new season
heading your way with a couple
of twists that are going to
catch the next group of
Survivors by surprise.
 PROBST: Next season, Survivor
travels to a stunning location
with an all-new twist.
In the exotic waters of Panama
sits a tiny island of exile that
will play into the game like
never before.
Each week, at least one castaway
will be banished to this
desolate place, separated from
their tribe mates for days at a
time, in one of the most
unforgiving environments yet.
Strategy will be turned on its
head, and survival will take on
a whole new meaning.
And though this island will be a
place to be feared, something
hidden within its rocky shores
may be the key to $1 million and
the title of Sole Survivor.
The 16 new castaways will be
divided into tribes in a way
never before seen.
Who will outwit, outplay and
outlast all the others?
Join us as the adventure
continues with Survivor: Panama,
Exile Island.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: And if you want to
own a piece of Survivor:
Guatemala, you can do so.
Immediately following the show,
eBay.
All kind of props up for bid.
We've raised a million and a
half dollars for the Elizabeth
Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation.
And we will see you soon for
Survivor: Panama, Exile
Island.
Thank you, guys.
Great season.
Good night.
