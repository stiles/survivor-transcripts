         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago
among the ruins of an ancient
civilization, 16 Americans began
the adventure of a lifetime.
Their first surprise came in the
form of two previous castaways.
Bobby Jon and Stephenie, the
last remaining members of their
tribe in Palau return to compete
one more time.
 What's up, guys?








 PROBST: Bobby Jon joined
Nakum and Stephenie joined
Yaxha.
 My main fear coming into the
game was maybe they just want to
get rid of me.
 PROBST: Survivors ready.
Go.
Immediately they faced their
first reward challenge, an 11-
mile race through the jungles of
Guatemala.
It lasted through the night...
 Wait please.








 PROBST: And into the next
day.
 We need to, like, get right
on their asses.
 PROBST: Though both tribes
pushed themselves to the
limit...
 Oh, yeah!
 PROBST: ...it was Nakum that
crossed the finish line first
winning flint and the better
tribe camp.
But their victory came at a high
price.
 How you doing?
 Huh?
 His eyes are rolling back.
Bobby Jon?
 These big strong guys, strong
as ox's and they are all down.
 PROBST: At the first immunity
challenge the Yaxha tribe made a
comeback...
Yaxha wins immunity!
...sending Nakum to
their first Tribal Council where
Jim, the most ailing of the men,
was voted out.
The tribes continued to fight
hard at the challenges.
Temperature update: 114 degrees.
And Yaxha's comeback proved
short-lived when they lost
Morgan and Brianna in back-to-
back Tribal Councils.
On day 10, the tribes were
switched.
Drop your buffs.
 Oh, my god.
 PROBST: Gary, Brian and Amy
found themselves outnumbered
three to four on the new Yaxha
tribe.
 We are decimated here.
Decimated.
 PROBST: And at Nakum,
Stephenie and Jamie mixed things
up when they immediately bonded
with Judd.
 You know when you have a
natural click.
 Yeah, you can you feel it.
 Go, go, go!
 PROBST: Amy is down!
The rivalry between the tribes
intensified.
And intertribal conflicts boiled
over.
 She comes to camp; "You have
ADD. Do you know that?"
When you first meet somebody is
that something nice to say?
 This is what it's like to try
to talk to him.
 You should just shut up.
 PROBST: Nakum lost Brooke and
Margaret.
And Yaxha lost Blake, Brian and
Amy.
On night 18, the tribes merged.
 We have new buffs for you.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Merge, baby, merge.
 PROBST: And tree mail brought
news of a small immunity idol
hidden in the jungle.
 There's an immunity idol
about this big in a
jungle that's this big.
 PROBST: At the first
individual immunity challenge, a
tribe divide was exposed when
some members of the former Nakum
tribe chose to sit out and feast
while the former Yaxha's all
played for their lives.
 Brianna and Bobby Jon know
they have a chance of going home
tonight.
 I thought we were one tribe.
 You know it's not one tribe,
so why are you saying that right
now?
 Because I can and I will and
I want to.
 PROBST: The tension between
the two former tribes didn't
ease at Tribal Council.
 Somebody is sitting there
saying "Go, Judd, Whoo-woo!"
I'm just, like, that's just no
class.
 He can think what he wants to
think.
I am the bigger man.
 Man, just shut up, dude. God.
 PROBST: Before we get to the
vote, an immunity idol was
hidden at your camp.
If anybody has found that, now
is the time to present it.
 PROBST: When the hidden idol
didn't surface, Brandon was the
first member of the outnumbered
Yaxha's to get the boot.
Things were not looking good for
Danni, Gary or Bobby Jon.
Jamie doesn't knock Judd out.
When Judd won a clue to the
location of the hidden immunity
idol he shared it with
Stephenie.
 "It's not buried or concealed
nor directly on the ground."
 That'd be, like, in a tree.
 PROBST: Then Judd lied to the
rest of his tribe.
 It is totally on the ground.
 PROBST: Gary was suspicious
when he caught Judd looking for
the idol in the trees.
 If it's on the ground, I
wonder why he is looking in the
trees.
No doubt in my mind that Judd is
lying.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council
Gary stunned his tribe when he
revealed that he found the
hidden immunity idol.
 Oh, my God. Gary.
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: Gary was safe for one
more night and Bobby Jon became
the first member of the jury.
Bobby Jon, the tribe has spoken.
 Thank you very much.
I enjoyed it.
 PROBST: By day 27, Jamie's
paranoia had begun to wear on
the members of his alliance.
 He's like, so you're sticking
with the six, right?
And I'm, like, "Jamie, you're
driving me insane."
 PROBST: The 11th person voted
out of Survivor: Guatemala.
His tribe assured him he was
safe...
The tribe has spoken.
...Jamie was voted out.
 Blind-sided... Nice!
Now, that's how you vote
somebody out.
 PROBST: Gary and Rafe both
heading back with their last
flag.
Gary continued to give it his
all, but when Rafe won his
third immunity challenge...
Once again Rafe wins immunity!
...Gary attempted to stir things
up when he exposed Judd's lie at
Tribal Council.
 Way back when he got the clue
about the idol, he goes, "Okay,
I will tell you it is on the
ground."
I follow him out in the woods
next day and he is looking in
all the trees.
And the idol was in the tree.
 Okay. I lied about the damn
idol. Okay.
 PROBST: 12th person outted of
Survivor: Guatemala, Gary.
But all of Gary's game playing
couldn't save him and he was
voted out.
Danni was the last remaining
member of the former Yaxha tribe
and Lydia was on the outs with
her former alliance.
The odds against them both were
almost insurmountable.
 I've got to look at who is in
control of the game and play up
to it.
Because I'm not going to go
home.
 PROBST: At the auction, the
loved ones of the survivors were
revealed and Judd bought an
overnight stay with his wife
Kristen.
That night at camp Stephenie
assured Kristen that she and
Judd were tight to the end.
 PROBST: But Stephenie didn't
know Danni and Rafe were
conspiring against Judd.
 We just need to catch Judd
with some kind of lie.
You can't trust a person like
Judd.
But you can trust that you can't
trust them.
 PROBST: Just when she needed
it the most, Danni won immunity.
Steph is out.
Danni wins immunity.
Well played.
Then she pulled out all the
stops and worked on turning
Stephenie against Judd as well.
 I'd like to believe Judd but
he's already been caught in
quite a few lies and Danni
really hasn't lied at all.
 PROBST: Judd never saw it
coming.
Stephenie joined forces with
Danni, Rafe and Lydia and voted
him out.
 I hope you guys get bit by a
freakin' crocodile.
Scum bags.
 PROBST: As it all came down
to the wire, Rafe and Danni made
a promise to the end.
 Danni's promised me she would
take me to the Final Two.
That's a huge degree of security
at the end of a crazy, crazy
game.
 PROBST: At the reward
challenge Cindy won a new car.
Cindy wins reward.
But she was put on the spot when
she was given a difficult
choice.
 PROBST: In ten seasons of
Survivor, the person who won
the car reward has never, ever
won the game.
I will give you a chance to get
rid of the curse.
You can give up your car and
instead, each of the other four
will get a Pontiac Torrent.
Cindy chose to keep the car.
 I would love to give everyone
a car, but I am here to beat the
odds and so far I have.
 PROBST: Rafe was angry with
Cindy's decision and lobbied to
have her voted out.
 You do?
 PROBST: But Stephenie was
unsure.
 I vote off Cindy, I won't
get Jamie's, Judd's or Cindy's.
I told him I felt bad because we
already turned on Judd and Cindy
is in our alliance and now we're
going to be turning on Cindy and
this might be another vote I
could lose when it comes time
for the jury.
 PROBST: At the immunity
challenge...
Steph wins immunity.
...Steph secured herself a spot
in the Final Four.
 Finally I won something!
 PROBST: And at Tribal Council
she risked alienating another
member of the jury when she
sided with Rafe and helped vote
Cindy out.
 I'll think about you guys
when I will see the stars
through the sun roof of my new
car.
 PROBST: Cindy, the tribe has
spoken.
Now, only four remain.
Rafe, Danni, Lydia and
Stephenie.
Tonight they will compete in
their final immunity challenges.
Two will go on to face the jury.
One will outlast all the rest
and become the sole survivor.
( theme song playing )
 Good morning, Lydia.
 I woke up with a smile on my
face, just like I predicted.
Waking up this morning and
realizing I was one of the Final
Four was one of the greatest
feelings.
I always felt like I was the odd
man out.
Why am I here?
Is it my destiny?
Somebody is watching over me.
 Thanks, Lydia.
 Okay.
This is a nice batch, too.
 This morning around camp, I
was trying to be relaxed, but I
was a total wreck.
I am a huge Kansas Jayhawk
basketball fan.
In the last four years we have
gone to the Final Four twice and
haven't brought back the
championship.
So I feel like all this pressure
on me to go back home and bring
home a championship.
 Happy breakfast, Final Four.
Cheers to the Final Four.
 Congratulations.
 It feels really good to be
sitting here proud of every
decision I made in the game so
far, and like happy with the
people I am here with in the
Final Four.
It is really nice.
 Oh, my God.
This is a good one.
I got the... out of the jar.
♪ Oh, la, la... ♪
 What is it?
This morning we got this tree
mail and Lydia comes running up
the hill screaming and yelling
in weird sounds like it's a
basket of goodies or something,
you know, for being in the Final
Four.
 What is it?
 It better be good, Lydia?
 It is.
"37 days living amongst over
2,000 years of history, these
ancestral grounds are still
considered sacred.
These temples, still altars, as
you will soon see, the spirit
and culture of the Maya is still
alive today... and you are now
part this history.
Embrace it. Enjoy it.
Appreciate it."
We're gonna celebrate.
 Wait, but does it say
celebrate anywhere?
 No, but you see, this is what
I gathered from all of this.
I am excited.
That's right.
 Lydia, I thought you were
bringing up a freakin' seven-
course feast.
 No. You guys don't understand
my language?
Do you not comprehend what we
are saying here?
Look, I have... I have this
vision that we are going to go.
 Who decided to keep her
around?
 I was so certain about a big
feast and everything.
But, perhaps, the Mayan people
might come into our camp and do
some kind of ritual.
 Oh.
 Oh, my God. Hi.
 This family of Mayans come
walking up to camp.
There were two women and three
men.
And they came with these big
baskets and incense burning.
 Hello. Hi. How are you?
 None of them spoke any
English.
And they pretty much went over
here in front of the biggest
pyramid we have and kind of made
a circle with sugar and they lit
all these candles and all this
incense.
There was rosemary and poured
a bottle of honey on the fire.
And it was like hello, we want
the honey.
 ( speaking native language )
 The oldest gentleman, I
believe it was the father, he
was chanting the whole time,
chanting a prayer in each
direction that you, like, bless
yourself.
When they want to give thanks to
their ancestors, I guess that's
what they do.
They had this chicken that I
thought was dead but was alive.
I was, like, oh, are we going to
get to eat the chicken?
 ( speaking native language )
 As soon as the chicken came
out, Steph was like, oh, will
they kill it?
It was like, I really think this
is a sacrifice we are watching.
 ( speaking native language )
 ( chicken clucking )
 They pulled off the chicken's
head and threw it in the fire.
And Steph was like, "did they
kill it, Rafe?"
I was like they ripped the
chicken's head off and threw it
in the fire.
It is a dead chicken.
I just got so much out of
watching the ritual and just
hearing them speak Mayan.
 Gracias.
Being of Latin heritage and
Hispanic background myself, it
made me have a kinship, you
know, a place in my heart what
they did out here.
They also offered us the most
delicious tamales.
 Gracias.
 Gracias.
 Stephenie had her eyes on
that yard bird.
She was like ask them, ask them,
Lydia, if we can eat the bird.
 Okay. ( Speaking Spanish )
 No.
 No.
He says, "Oh, no, this is an
offering to the Mayan gods.
This is something that we're not
going to eat."
 It is the way of saying thank
you to the earth, thank you to
the sky, thank you to the water
and thank you to the ancestors
who built this temple.
 ( speaking Spanish )
 I have been waiting to have a
cultural experience here the
whole time, because...
To me, you don't understand
where you are until you have met
and experienced the people.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
First things first.
Steph, give it up.
You didn't have it very long,
but it served its purpose.
Got you to the Final Four.
Once again, immunity is back up
for grabs.
Today's immunity challenge is
the most complex Survivor-maze
ever constructed.
It is based on a very famous
Maya deity, the Seven Macaw,
which was a monstrous bird that
ruled the land at one time.
On my "go" the four of you will
race into the maze to collect
your assigned color of puzzle
pieces.
There are six stations but there
are eight pieces.
Some pieces come in pairs.
Every time you find a piece make
your way across the center of
the course, across the pontoons,
up the ladder and put the piece
in your puzzle board.
To get back into the maze, cross
a rope bridge and go down
another ladder.
Once you have collected all
eight pieces you must solve the
puzzle to reveal one of three
Mayan images: the jaguar, the
croc or the monkey.
The first person to solve it
correctly, immunity around their
neck and guaranteed spot in the
Final Three.
Worth playing for?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: I hope so.
We'll get started.
Let's go.
Here we go for immunity and a
spot in the Final Three.
Survivors ready?
Go!
This is a huge maze.
A lot of area to cover.
A lot of dummy stations.
Only a few that contain puzzle
pieces.
When you find a piece, it is up
to you if you are loud about
sharing it or quiet to conceal
it.
Stephenie coming back with her
first pair.
Lydia right behind.
Danni has a pair.
Steph finds the center of the
course.

Steph hustling back.
Still very tight.
Danni back with another puzzle
piece.
Danni, Rafe, Steph all with four
puzzle pieces.

Physically demanding. Day 37.
You are worn out.
You have to dig deep if you want
to win this.
Rafe back with another puzzle
piece.
Steph leaps across the pontoons
and makes up a lot of ground.
Rafe with his fifth piece.
Steph with her fifth piece.
They are neck and neck.
Heading back out onto the
course.

pieces.
Lydia with five pieces.
She is back out on the course.
Danni and Rafe both have found
another piece to their puzzle.
Steph has another piece to her
puzzle.
Danni back with another piece.
Danni with her fifth piece and
Rafe crossing the pontoon with
his 6th piece.

Steph and Rafe have one station
left each.
Danni got to keep moving if she
wants to be in this.
Danni has a piece.

Lydia will have a piece now.
Danni coming back with her 6th
piece.

left.
Steph finds her last station.
Lydia still fighting.
Those short little legs working.
Rafe coming back with his final
pair of pieces.
Stephenie right on his tail with
her final piece.
Going to be Rafe and Steph
putting the puzzle together.
Danni trying to stay in it.
Got to find her last station.
You are trying to form one of
three images.
The croc, the monkey or the
jaguar.
Danni has her last station and
has to get back here to work on
the puzzle.
Lydia still searching for her
last piece.
Danni has her last pair.
She's got to get back up here.
Danni racing across the
pontoons.
Rafe and Steph with a huge head
start.
Danni now in it.
First one to solve the puzzle
correctly guaranteed spot in the
Final Three.
Lydia not giving up.
She has her last piece.
Steph working.
Patience is key.
Do not panic.
Think.
 Okay, Jeff.
 PROBST: Rafe thinks he has
it.
Rafe has it.
Rafe wins immunity.
 Good job, Rafe.
 Good job, Rafe.
 Last piece.
 PROBST: Rafe, come on over.
Rafe, got to feel good to have
this again.
 Yeah. Especially at this
stage.
 PROBST: Rafe safe for
tonight's vote.
Lydia, Steph, Danni, 37 days.
For one of you that will be it.
Somebody going home tonight.
You have the afternoon to figure
out who it will be.
Head on back to camp.
 It was.
That was real serious.
 It's weird to have the
immunity necklace and know I am
going to the Final Three.
 You did great, Rafe.
 Thank you.
It is incredible.
It is like I really believe I
can get to the end of this game
and maybe win it.
 So am I.
I am not freakin' giving in.
Basically my strategy consists
of me getting to the Final
Two with Rafe, because I feel
Rafe's the only person I have a
chance to win the $1 million
against, because we have double
crossed the same people; we
played a very similar game.
We never lied to each other.
 Not once this whole game.
 I know.
From a strategic standpoint, if
we want to guarantee ourselves a
Final Two spot, most likely we
should take Lydia.
In a Final Three challenge,
guaranteed Lydia is not going to
win.
 I don't see us having a
problem.
 I don't either.
 Steph is like, the two of us
need to get to the Final Two.
And we should keep Lydia and
then we'll have a better shot of
winning the Final Three immunity
challenge.
I mean it's possible it is a
better strategic decision, but I
promised Danni that I would go
to the Final Three with her.
 Right.
 Rafe promised me top three.
But you know how that goes.
Everybody goes back on their
word, and so I am very uneasy
about it.
 I thought we had a plateful.
 Is that chicken carcass still
over there?
 Yeah, you want to check it
out?
 Can we do that or no?
 I would try it.
 I could tell since we had
that ritual that Steph wanted to
eat that chicken.
 I will go check it out.
Lydia, want to check that
chicken out?
 Looks like it may be good.
 It is. Look. Oh my gosh.
 Oh, we got to eat it.
 Bring it over and see what
people think.
 Um, look at all these ants.
 I've already asked him.
But he hasn't given me an answer
yet.
You have a chance to be bouncing
something on your head and win
and I would rather go with you,
me and Rafe than you picking
Danni.
 Okay. Will you let me know?
 I will.
 Thank you.
 Actually, I think Stephenie
is leaning towards taking me to
the Final Three because I don't
have no threat when it comes to
immunity challenge tomorrow.
You know, if I wasn't voted out
tonight.
 You guys, it looks so good.
I mean, we can say a little
prayer or something, if you
want, to make you feel better.
 Are you guys okay with this?
We are surviving out here.
We have no food but corn.
 We haven't eaten in 37 days.
There's a chicken over there
that's cooked with honey...
 Oh, no, I will eat it.
I will so eat it.
 You know what?
This is part of survival, right?
 Got to be okay to eat it,
right, Lydia?
 My gosh, it is delicious.
Rafe, are you okay?
It is cooked chicken, man.
You would eat it if your mom
cooked it.
 It was kind of a powerful
experience today to watch the
ritual and I felt that I learned
so much about sacrifice.
 Rafe, what's the problem?
 I don't know.
It is like they just came and
sacrificed it.
So I felt like for me to eat the
chicken would just be totally
pointless and I would lose
everything that I learned from
the ritual because the ritual
was about not eating the
chicken.
 We are surviving out here.
 I think I will pass.
You guys eat it though.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 It is day 37.
You're gonna let the chicken
just sit there and let the bugs
get it? No way.
I am going to eat it.
They came, they did their
sacrifice and we prayed with
them.
But it's hours later and the
chicken is still there and I am
eating it.
 After eating the chicken, a
huge storm moves in, lots of
lightening.
Actually, the biggest since we
have been here and we started
talking about, "Oh, no, maybe
there is something to this."
(thunder crashing)
 That is freaky.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
Bobby Jon, Jamie, Gary, Judd and
Cindy voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
So take me through the day.
Rafe, it started with a very
unique ceremony.
An authentic Maya blessing?
 Yes.
We started out the day and had
five Mayans came up to camp and
kind of put all this stuff on
the ground and sacrificed the
chicken in front of the temple
to thank the ancestors for
building this place and kind of
get their connection to the
past.
 PROBST: Does it connect you
more to this land after being
part of something like that?
 Yes, it defintely does.
To see this is a place that
these Maya are living today
actually come to do rituals.
It was like, wow, we are really
here and really a part of what's
going on in this culture.
 PROBST: So you get back to
camp, Lydia.
I don't know about you.
It poured where I was.
Did you guys get a storm?
 Yes. A big one.
Thunder and lightning.
Not only that, Jeff.
Well, there's a possibility with
something that we did.
( laughter )
 Damn it, Lydia.
Explain it.
 I don't know how to explain
it.
 Okay, Jeff.
You know what, being here 37
days, you know we have only had
corn.
Well, you know that chicken that
they gave to the temple and to
the gods?
 PROBST: You ate the chicken?
 We ate the chicken.
 PROBST: Wow.
 And, Jeff, after we ate the
chicken, I know for a fact the
Mayan gods were upset with us.
Because why would it thunder and
lightning and pour down rain?
I mean, it was scary.
 PROBST: Rafe, you really
don't respect the ceremony?
 Actually, I didn't eat the
chicken.
 PROBST: You did not eat it.
 PROBST: Danni did you eat it?
 Yes.
 PROBST: Steph, you ate it?
 Yes.
 PROBST: I am not judging you
guys whether it was right or
wrong, but we're definitely
going to talk about it.
 I respected the ritual.
I thought it was amazing.
But we have been here 37 days
and we're starving and we
decided collectively, as a
group, we were going to eat it.
The storm was weird.
Yeah, I mean, we really thought
the reason it did storm was
because we did eat the chicken.
 PROBST: All right.
So, Lydia, how surprised would
you be if it is you tonight?
'Cause it's a one-in-three
chance it is you.
 I feel that I don't pose a
physical threat to anybody.
I have not won anything since
day one.
So if they choose me to stay in,
they have a better shot in going
to the Final Two.
They really, really do.
 PROBST: Danni, Lydia makes a
good point.
 Well, yeah, she does, but
she ends up in the Final Two,
Lydia is your clear winner,
because everybody loves Lydia.
I think that's why she would be
a bigger threat.
 PROBST: Steph, at this point
in the game, what do you base
your vote on?
 Lydia is a huge, huge mental
threat and she's well-liked.
Same thing with Danni, though.
Danni is a pretty big threat and
she's also really well-liked
because she's never really had
to back stab anybody.
So for me, it is a pretty hard
decision tonight.
 PROBST: All right.
Just to be official.
Rafe, you have immunity.
 I'm keeping it.
 PROBST: Rafe is the only one
you cannot vote for.
It is time to vote.
Rafe, you're up.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read the
decision is final and the person
voted out is asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.
I will read the votes.
First vote: Danni.
Lydia.
One vote Lydia.
One vote Danni.
Lydia.
Two votes Lydia.
One vote Danni.
I will read the last vote.
15th person voted out of
Survivor: Guatemala, Lydia.
Lydia, you need to bring me your
torch.
 Thank you.
Thank you. Stay strong.
 PROBST: Lydia, the tribe has
spoken.
It's time for you to go.
Rafe, Danni, Steph, you have
survived another Tribal Council
and made it to the Final Three.
Tomorrow you will take part in
your final immunity challenge.
Hope the gods have forgiven you.
Grab your torches and head back
to camp and try to get some
sleep.
 This was by far the hardest
experience I have ever had in my
life.
The heat and the mosquitoes and
hardly any food.
So I am very proud of myself.
You know, just the history alone
and being in the ruins all on a
daily basis for 37 days was a
very, very incredible
experience.
And I would not trade this for
the world.
(monkey howling)
(howling continues)
 That monkey is so annoying.
 It's day 38, we were up a lot
earlier today than we have been
up in a while.
Monkeys were really loud.
Louder than usual.
Trying to boil water, it poured
last night, so everything is
wet.
 Oh, my gosh.
It smells so bad.
The corn is, like, disgusting.
There's maggots in it.
It is moldy.
It is nasty.
But, um, it is day 38.
So you have to be happy--
whether you eat or drink or not.
 "Congratulations, Final
Three.
Today you will pay tribute to
your 15 fallen comrades.
Hike from camp to the temple
ruins where you will find the
torches and images of survivors
who played the game but were
outwitted, outplayed and
outlasted.
Take the images of your former
tribe mates and immortalize
their memory by sacrificing them
to the fire.
At the end of this journey you
will compete in one final
immunity challenge.
Tonight one of you will join the
15 who are already gone."
 It is such a huge honor to go
through and reflect back on the
game and everybody we played
with.
There were some tough, tough
competitors.
 Jim. He was one tough guy.
Led us through the jungle.
If it hadn't been for him we
wouldn't have won the first
reward challenge.
 He was a great guy.
 Being in a game is something
I thought about ever since that
first Survivor.
Who doesn't say I can do that,
but who says that when you are
63, you know?
I am not out to be some hero.
I am out to prove things myself
and maybe to motivate somebody.
 Hi, Morgan.
 She was definitely a fighter.
 I look like this sorority
girl that can't do anything.
It didn't turn out to be so
hard for me physically.
It was hard in a way I never
expected it to be.
It was hard socially and that's
where it got me.
 Brianna.
 Who expects some girl that
goes shopping every day to go
out and survive in the jungle?
I couldn't have asked for more
of a culture shock.
I take away a whole new respect
for everyone playing this game.
It is hard.
It is brutal out there.
 Hi, Brookster.
 The whole experience was a
lot more difficult than I
expected.
But I was really surprised at
how my body was able to adapt to
the whole situation.
I realized that limits were very
much in my mind and there's so
much more I can accomplish if I
don't stop myself.
 The golden boy.
 Golden boy!
( laughter )
♪ With the golden hair. ♪
 I came here with some focused
goals and one was to always have
a smile on my face.
That was tough being that my
body shut down so bad.
I came out with my honor and
integrity, two things I would
rather walk with, than $1
million.
I am young.
I will make that money
eventually.
 Margaret.
 Margaret. One tough mama.
 I learned that I was a strong
woman, much the motherly,
nursing, nurturing kind.
But not so vulnerable and weak
to lay down and be rolled over.
I kept my integrity.
I have a great deal of pride
about how I played the game.
 Here's Brian.
Happy trails, Brian.
 I played this game so hard
for every second I was in it.
I honestly believed I was going
to win this game.
But I have absolutely no
regret, because if you're going
to go, go the way I went where
you are blind-sided.
As far as I am concerned, that's
the way to go.
 Here is our Amy.
 Oh, my gosh.
I never heard more swear words.
 When I came into this game I
was never going to give up.
When I sprained my ankle and had
to go out again, I sucked it up
and dealt with the pain and won
the match.
I think back and wonder what did
I do?
I feel good about where I stand.
 Brandon. Oh, my gosh.
Nobody could cut ropes like
Brandon. That's for sure.
 It was like nothing I have
ever experienced.
Pretty much one big blurry ass-
whooping and I got voted off.
Being from the Midwest, I have
always wanted to travel.
Having come out here made me
think it is not that hard.
Just going to go out there and
seize it.
 Good ol' Bobby Jon.
 This go around I am supposed
to be this person that was such
a hard competitor.
I am Bobby Jon.
I am tough. Right. Whatever.
I got humbled by mother nature.
It showed me, hey, guess what,
big shot, you ain't the man.
It was a refining moment for me,
and I needed it.
 Jamie.
 Jamie...
 Yeah...
 See you later, Jamie.
 The thing I missed the most
was being able to trust people.
That's what I am sure everybody
misses most in the jungle is
someone that actually cares.
I wish I would have had four
people that wasn't going to harm
me, but it's gonna make me a
more honest person.
 Gary.
 Like a father figure to me
out here.
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 There's no doubt in my mind
that competition is just like
life.
You have to communicate, be part
of a team, work as hard as you
possibly can if you want to get
to where you want to be.
That's what I'm going to take
back with me.
 Sounds good.
 It's Judd.
 Judd.
 I call this Survivor
experience for me like a mental
rehab.
I never went camping before.
So I am going back a whole new
man.
I mean, much more relaxed.
I won't be a hot head and run
around like a lunatic.
 Cindy.
Bye, Cindy.
 Never in a million years
could I have conjured up the
past 36 days of my life.
I made the most of the situation
and left the game with a brand
new car.
So, I can't think of anything I
can possibly complain about,
other than not winning.
 Oh, Lydia.
 Lydia, oh, Lydia.
We didn't want to get rid of ya.
 For 37 days, I always thought
that I'm just a provider.
I am more than that, and I never
thought I was.
It really brought me out of my
shell.
I am very proud of myself.
But I tell you, no more corn for
me-- I guarantee it.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Ready to get to the final
immunity challenge?
 Yes.
 PROBST: First things first,
Rafe.
For the last time, immunity is
back up for grabs.
Today's immunity challenge will
require balance and intense
concentration.
Here is how it works.
You must balance on a wobbly
platform for as long as you can.
The platform swivels 360
degrees, offers very little
stability.
For the first hour, you will
have the aid of two ropes--
one for each hand.
That will help you find your
center of balance, get
comfortable with the platform.
After one hour, you will release
one rope.
This is when it becomes more
difficult.
You still have one rope to hold
onto.
If after 30 minutes you are
still hanging on, you'll release
the second rope, and you'll go
it alone.
The person left standing wins
immunity, guaranteed a spot in
the final two, and as
importantly, will decide who
goes with them to that final
Tribal Council-- who sits across
from that jury with a million
dollars on the line.
I know it's worth playing for.
We'll draw for spots and get
started.
Okay, everybody, leap up.
Land your feet on the platform.
This challenge has begun.
We're going one hour with both
ropes.
That swivel is very sensitive.
 PROBST: 20 minutes.
 Left?
 PROBST: In.
You've only been up there 20
minutes.
You just passed the 40-minute
mark.
( monkeys grunting in distance )
Howler monkeys saying hello.
( grunting )
Danni, you've had immunity once.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Steph?
 Once.
 PROBST: Once.
Rafe?
 Four times.
 PROBST: One minute left.
You need to begin to prepare to
release one rope.
Can be either hand.
If you lose your balance, you
are not out until your feet hit
the base of the platform.
 PROBST: Five, four, three,
two, one.
Release a rope.
Steph in trouble.
Steph fighting to stay on.
Got to get back to that board.
She's still alive till her feet
hit the ground.
Danni's swiveling, she's in
trouble.
Don't let those legs hit.
Rafe's starting to wobble.
Rafe's in trouble.
Everybody hanging on by their
rope.
Rafe trying to get back.
Do not let your feet touch.
Steph has found a position.
Barely hanging on.
Rafe's struggling.
Danni's found a position.
Rafe has found a spot.
Everybody found the same spot.
Everybody's instincts kicked in.
Everybody utilized everything
there was in this challenge.
Now it's going to be endurance.
How long can you stay in this
position?
 PROBST: Down to one minute.
When your hands come off that
final rope, your hands are no
longer a part of this challenge.
I want to make sure everybody's
clear.
Your hands cannot touch the
post.
Ten seconds.
Same as before-- when I say
"release," release.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Release.
Rafe.
Your hand touched the pole.
You're out.
Have a seat.
Rafe lost his concentration.
That's how quickly you can be
out of this challenge.
Rafe, you look either very sad
or out of it.
 I can't believe I just lost
focus for, like, two seconds.
( Steph grunts )
 PROBST: Steph, when we
started this part of the
challenge, you were about four
feet further up on that post.
( Steph sighs )
 I know.
 PROBST: That hat was at the
small of your back.
It's now in the crook of your
neck.
 My lower back is killing me.
 PROBST: How are you feeling
now, Danni?
 Feel the same.
 PROBST: How about you, Steph?
 I can't move.
( sniffles )
( pained sigh )
 I can't move.
 PROBST: Steph is out.
Danni has won final immunity.
( Steph crying )
 Danni, I want to, um...
I want to release you from any
promise you made to me about who
you take to the final two, and
like, take whoever you want
tonight.
I'm really serious about that
and I really mean it.
Okay?
 Okay.
You are a great guy.
 That's what I mean.
Okay?
 You did such a good job.
 I sucked.
( Steph sniffles )
Oh, God.
( Rafe speaks indistinctly )
 You don't suck.
You're here.
 I cannot move my back.
 PROBST: Danni.
 Oh, sorry.
 PROBST: You don't need to
move.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Immunity.
You are safe tonight at Tribal
Council.
Big decision.
You're going to the final two.
Who's going with you... Steph or
Rafe?
You have the afternoon to figure
that out.
See you guys tonight at Tribal.
 Oh, my gosh.
You did so good.
 You really did.
 I am shocked that I am in the
final two.
It's just overwhelming to think
about having the numbers against
me, and here I am.
And I'm just blown away about
it.
I am happy I won but I hate
being put in... I just hate
spot.
 Don't feel you have to do it
just because you made a promise.
You know, you should make your
decision tonight based on
whatever you make your decision
on.
 You know, it's was horrible
coming into camp.
It's like you have this high
from winning immunity and then
you realize I'm going to have to
vote out, you know, one of the
two-- Stephenie or Rafe-- that
have been... really have been
loyal to me.
Originally, I was set on taking
Rafe because I gave him my word.
But then Rafe told me, he goes
"I will release you from any
promises or bonds.
Do whatever you need to do."
So that puts even more pressure
on me.
 I hate being in this
position.
She fought so hard today.
 She did.
That's why I feel like, you
know...
 Her legs were shaking.
 I sat there and watched it.
It was horrible.
And that's why I felt, like, I
don't know.
I just didn't feel right going
into Tribal Council tonight,
like, it being a done deal
just 'cause you promised me
something.
You know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 I mean, obviously, I still
would like it if you took me
to the final two.
Danni wouldn't be here if it
weren't for me.
But I feel good about letting
Danni out of her promise because
to me, tonight, like, I want
Steph and I to still be fighting
together.
We have been fighting together
since day one.
I feel like Steph deserves a
chance.
 You don't have to give me
anything.
You don't owe me anything.
 No, I-I do.
I owe you and Rafe both.
 Rafe and I could have
guaranteed ourselves the final
two spot if we took Lydia.
 I really don't think I have a
shot really over either one of
you.
Because, I mean, everybody loves
Rafe.
And then, you know, you were so
tight with that group.
But they, uh, you know, they
tend to forget all that stuff.
 I think I have a 50-50 chance
right now.
I have no idea what Danni's
gonna do at this point.
And if she decides to bring Rafe
to the final two then, you know
what, I played the best game I
know how to play.
And I'm not gonna be ashamed of
that.
 Stephenie, I really don't
know.
 I know.
Why don't you just go with your
heart, you know, when you get
there.
Go with it.
 Oh, God.
I am still really torn between
Rafe and Stephenie.
You know, I am competing for a
million dollars, you know, and
you have to really think about
what you're gonna do here at
the final two.
And it's so hard.
It's such a hard decision.
But, you know, you're here to
win.
It's definitely going to be a
game time decision.
I'm not gonna be ready until I
have to walk up there and write
a name down tonight.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of the jury.
Bobby Jon.
Jamie.
Gary.
Judd.
Cindy.
And Lydia, voted out at the last
Tribal Council.
So... Rafe, Danni, Steph.
The last Tribal Council, after
weeks of voting out the
strongest, just when you are on
the cusp of your last challenge,
you vote out not one of the
strongest, but the weakest.
And for two of you, it could be
a million dollar mistake.
Steph, any regrets looking at
Lydia over there?
 I don't.
I mean, I didn't know if today's
challenge was gonna be
completely physical or
completely mental.
So, it could have gone either
way.
 PROBST: But wait.
Let's hold off on that.
In 95% of the challenges, Rafe,
Danni, Steph, Lydia's gonna be
the weak person.
 Well, the only chance I had
was to tie it up at the last
Tribal Council.
Because Rafe already gave Danni
his word and he wasn't changing
his vote.
But that still wouldn't have
even guaranteed Lydia staying
here.
So you know what, go against the
best.
And if she beats me fair and
square, she beats me fair and
square and she deserves it.
 PROBST: Danni, did you ever
imagine a guaranteed spot in the
final two and you decide who's
gonna sit next to you?
 I am so blown away that I am
in this position.
I can't believe I won immunity
today.
I went back to camp and I'm just
like, "Did that really happen?"
I mean, I cannot believe that
I'm still here.
It was an absolute miracle.
 PROBST: Steph, you were very
emotional when you finally went
down.
 It was such a tough
challenge.
I was in so much pain and I just
felt like a failure.
You know, I went until I
collapsed and I just sat there
and pretty much just cried for a
couple minutes.
 PROBST: Rafe, you said
something to Danni right after
the challenge.
I caught a couple of words.
 Yeah. Danni had promised me a
long time ago that if I could
somehow get her to the final
three and she won the challenge,
she'd take me to the final two.
And so, I told Danni, "I release
you from the promise."
 PROBST: Why would you do
that?
It sounds like you put
everything on today's challenge
and nothing on the past 37 days.
 I am saying forget about that
one promise that you made and if
you think that I'm worthy of
going to the final two, then
take me to the final two.
If you think it's Steph, then
take Steph.
 PROBST: So Danni, what's
going through your mind right
now?
You have a huge decision.
Pick the right person, you're a
millionaire.
Pick the wrong person, you're
$900,000 not as rich.
 I mean, to be secure in the
final two is amazing.
But you want to make sure you
make the right decision.
I mean, when you look at it one
way, there's 10 million
different ways it's right.
You look at the other way, it's
10 million different ways it's
right.
So it's so hard.
 PROBST: Give me one reason
why picking Rafe is the right
choice.
 Since the merge, he's really
been an awesome friend to me and
has helped me along so much in
the game that I wouldn't be in
this position if it wasn't for
him.
 PROBST: Why would Steph be
the right choice?
 Well, she made a lot of
people mad at her in the game
and would be the easier choice
if you wanted a better chance at
winning the million.
 PROBST: Steph, when you
listen to Danni, what are you
thinking inside?
 If she wants to stick with
her heart, she will go with
Rafe.
But if she wants to guarantee
herself a little bit of a better
chance, she should take me.
Because I think that everybody
on the jury thinks that Rafe's
more likable than me.
So she's got a pretty tough
decision to make.
 PROBST: Rafe, how about for
you?
 I don't think that the jury
necessarily likes me a whole lot
more than they like Steph
because I screwed over the same
people.
( chuckles )
And they know it.
You know, I think Danni is a
person who almost all the way
through this game has said she
goes with her heart.
So it is kind of nice to hear
her say, "If I go with my heart
tonight, I'll go with Rafe."
Because that's the way she
played the game up until this
point.
 PROBST: Okay, here is how it
works.
Rafe, you cannot vote for Danni.
You can only vote for Steph.
Steph cannot vote for Danni.
She can only vote for Rafe.
Your votes cancel each other
out.
The only person voting tonight
is Danni.
Danni, it's time to vote.
 PROBST: I'll go get the vote.
 PROBST: Once the vote is
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council immediately.
I'll read the vote.
16th person voted out of
Survivor: Guatemala...
Rafe.
Need to bring me your torch?
( Rafe speaks softly )
 PROBST: Rafe, the tribe has
spoken.
It's time for you to go.
 Good luck tomorrow, guys.
 PROBST: Danni, you've clearly
made your decision.
You kept the person you think
you have the best chance of
winning against.
The only thing left to do is see
if you were right.
You'll have one more night in
Guatemala.
You will return here tomorrow
night for your final Tribal
Council.
Grab your torches.
Head out.
 Well, I feel like I played a
smart game, um, and as honest a
game as I could.
So, I am really proud of myself.
I'm proud of what I did.
You know, I stayed true to my
moral compass and I betrayed
people when I thought I should.
And I stuck with people when I
thought I should.
Danni, I understand the decision
you made, and I thought you were
the one person who would take me
to the final two.
And you didn't.
So, Stephenie, I'm absolutely
rooting for you.
I think you played a great game.
And, um, I will be voting for
you tomorrow night.
( birds chirping )
( monkeys grunting )
( monkeys grunting )
( Steph sighs )
 Did you sleep?
 I did. Did you?
 I tossed and turned quite a
bit, but...
 Oh, my God.
 Here we are in the final two.
 Danni and Steph are the final
two.
Both names in yellow.
 Yeah.
I can't believe this.
 It is day 39.
Danni and I woke up this morning
with smiles on our faces
'cause last night was the last
night that we are sleeping in
the Guatemalan jungle with all
these crazy creatures.
( monkey grunting )
 I was the one who overcame
every odd.
I was the one with the target on
my back.
And then to get to the last day
in the final two?
You know, I'm really proud of
myself.
I can't believe I would ever, in
a million years, be able to do
that.
 This is it.
Last time to the pool.
 Yeah.
No more mosquitoes.
 Absolutely.
Stephenie and I are so much
alike.
It's just so funny that we ended
up together at the end.
The two jocks, you know.
And to outlast all the boys, you
know, it was kind of fun.
Two tough girls.
 For me, it was a lot of mind
over matter out here.
Again, if you are not strong-
minded, you'll just collapse.
 Sorry.
Just leave it there.
 I am so freakin' weak.
 Yeah.
 Now, after this, I know for a
fact there is nothing that's
ever gonna stand in my way.
 Last time we have to wash our
clothes.
Last bath.
 Oh.
 Stephenie was the best
competitor.
And to make it as far as she did
is tough.
And she's definitely the
toughest competitor.
I think it's great to go to the
final two against the toughest
player.
 You can't predict this game
at all.
 Everything happens for a
reason.
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm gonna miss Guatemala.
This has been a great
experience.
It's something not everybody
gets a chance to do, obviously.
But it's been awesome.
 Should we get all of the
palm fronds out of the
shelter and put them here?
 I can't believe it.
 We figured because we're not
gonna sleep here anymore, why
don't we just start breaking
down the shelter and just burn
everything.
So we started to burn some of
the pompoms.
Burning everything.
Sacrificing everything for the
Mayan gods.
 We made it all the way.
That's the more the amazing
thing.
 I can't be happier with the
way everything turned out.
I think everybody back home will
be so proud of both of us.
 To know you made it every
day.
 Right.
 It's such an amazing
accomplishment.
 I know.
 No matter what situation in
life you are in, you may be
down, but you are never out.
That's a huge lesson I learned
here.
For the jury tonight I plan on
being myself and try to be a
nice person, the all-American
girl next door.
So it just kind of depends on
the questions they ask and how I
need to react to it.
 I did everything in my power
to get me as far as I could in
this game.
I don't know what the jury's
gonna throw at me.
But whatever they throw at me,
I'm definitely going to have an
answer.
I mean, I have good reason for
every move I made in this game.
None of them are gonna scare me.
Bottom line is I outwitted,
outplayed and outlasted every
single one of them.
And that's why I'm in the final
two and they're not.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the jury.
Bobby Jon.
Jamie.
Gary.
Judd.
Cindy.
Lydia.
And Rafe.
Voted out at the last Tribal
Council.
Danni, first things first.
You can take off your immunity
necklace.
You don't need it anymore.
Well, congratulations on doing
what 16 other people could not
do in this game, and that is
make it to the final two.
The jury composed of seven
people that you had a hand
either directly or indirectly in
voting out, now holds your fate
in their hands.
And based on the answers that
you give them to their questions
tonight, they will decide which
one of the two of you they think
is most deserving of the title
of Sole Survivor and the check
for a million dollars that goes
with it.
Here is how it'll work.
You two will have a chance to
make opening statements, a
chance to try to convince them
why you are the most deserving.
Then they will get their first
chance to address you with a
question and a statement.
Then you will get a chance to
make a closing comment.
And then we vote.
Make sense?
 Uh-huh.
 PROBST: Let's get started.
Danni, opening statement.
 Okay, um...
Gosh, I don't know where to
begin.
I just feel honored to be in
this position.
Because making that merge from
Yaxha over to Nakum and being in
that numbers game, I thought
there was no chance in heck that
I would ever be sitting in this
position.
And I was surprised that nobody
really thought that I was a
threat.
Because I do have a little bit
of an athletic background, and I
knew I couldn't be stopped when
it came to endurance because
I've overcome a couple of
hardships in my life that
made me strong mentally.
And I tried to play the game the
best that I could, as honest
that I could.
And I just hope at the end of
all this, after everything is
done, that we'll be able to have
you guys come to Kansas City and
eat some good barbecue and go to
a ball game.
 PROBST: Steph, opening
statement.
 Um, I just, I first want to
start off by basically thanking
all of you for making this an
amazing, amazing experience for
me.
I never thought coming into
this Survivor that I would even
have a shot at making it past
even the first Tribal Council.
So, to be sitting in the final
two next to Danni, I am
completely honored.
And I know that there are a few
people that are a little upset
with me so I can't wait to talk
to you, and I hope can I ease
your mind a little bit.
I will be as honest as I have
ever been.
You know, this has been a great
ride, and I am glad I could have
experienced it with all of you.
 PROBST: All right.
Jury, in a moment you get your
first chance to address Danni
and Steph.
I'll give you a moment to think
about what you want to say.
 PROBST: Okay, jury.
You've heard their opening
statements.
It's your turn now to address
them with a question and/or
comment.
Bobby Jon, you're up.
 How is it going?
 Good.
 Thanks.
 First of all, I want to say
after a long 39 days or
whatever, nobody can ever take
away from you for making it to
the final two.
 Thank you.
 That's for certain.
Steph, I will start with you.
I know the only reason I am
standing right here is because
of you.
So I do appreciate that.
I really do.
But my first question for you is
how proud are you of yourself of
playing this game up until now?
 Actually, I am proud of the
way I played this game.
I know there are two people in
particular that I have sort of
backstabbed.
And other than that, I have
played the best game I know how
to play.
I came into this game with a
huge target on my back just like
you did.
 Right.
 And there's nothing I regret.
And there's nothing I'd take
back that I did.
 Good answer.
Danni, I guess the same thing.
I wanna ask you is up until now,
are you proud of how you played
the game?
 I am.
I'm happy with the way I played
the game.
And I was surprised at how long
I stuck around and feel just
grateful to be here.
And the only thing I wish that
could happen differently is that
we would have won a few more of
those immunity challenges so
when we merged over,
we would've...
 Right.
 Had our group together 'cause
we had so much fun.
 That's all I got.
 PROBST: Thanks, Bobby Jon.
 Thanks.
 PROBST: Gary.
 I think this game is still
going to be played until the
last answer that you give
tonight.
So I'm gonna judge my vote
tonight on who I think gives me
the most honest answers.
Straight out, no garbage.
I want to start with Steph
first.
I want to know why I should not
vote for you tonight.
 Why you shouldn't?
 I guess the first thing was
we made an alliance the first
day.
And I said, you know, no matter
what, we'll try to stick
together.
And then we got separated and I
formed another alliance.
And when you came over, you
know, I didn't.
I voted you out.
So, yeah, maybe there is a
reason why maybe you shouldn't
vote for me.
 Okay.
Thank you.
Danni, same question.
 First of all, I definitely
had an alliance with you.
But also, I was aligning myself
with Rafe.
That was maybe the wrong thing
to do.
So I made a selfish move at that
point.
And that's one thing I'm never
normally is selfish.
But in this game you have to be
at times.
And that is the main reason.
I'm sorry for that.
 Okay.
Thank you very much.
 PROBST: Thank you, Gary.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Jamie.
 What an adventure.
( laughing )
I will say that.
I will go to Danni first.
I've always believed it is not
where you go; it's who you go
with.
My question to you is if you
would have had numbers, who
would your top five been and
why?
 Well, definitely, Bobby Jon
and Gary.
Those two, and then Brandon.
Definitely.
Brandon and I had a good bond.
If we would've had four of us
there together, something would
have happened.
But I would have liked for it to
end up that way for sure.
 Okay.
Stephenie, you get a little bit
of a tougher one.
 Thanks.
 My question to you is: I
wouldn't talk to people if I was
going to vote them out.
I am not good with getting close
to people and letting them go.
And with you, you'd be the best
friend till we were in Tribal
Council.
And then you'd vote them out.
And my question is how do you
think the jury who has to
decide, how do you think they
feel about that when they saw
that?
 That's a good question.
I'll start with you.
The day your name came up to get
voted out, it was not my full
decision.
I mean, there was a group of us.
And I have a hard time saying to
somebody, "I'm voting you out."
Because like you said,
blind-sided is the best way to
go.
So I would only hope those
people will see I had really
good reasons in doing so and
they would respect my game and
award me their vote because they
think I am deserving of it.
 That's good to know.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Jamie.
Lydia.
 Stephenie, I have been loyal
to you since day six of this
game.
 I know.
 But you voted me out.
So, why should I vote for you
tonight?
 Actually, I want to thank you
for being so loyal to me the
entire game, Lydia, and you
absolutely were.
Even though you and I had been
together since day one, if I
took you to the final, I would
probably have a better shot of
beating you than Danni.
But then, what does that say for
me?
Who is super-competitive and
super-athletic.
And I'm gonna take Lydia because
I think I can beat her?
I mean, that's not what really
competitive people do.
So, I went up against the best
and I'd like to beat the best.
And that's why I'm sitting next
to her right now.
 Okay.
And question for Danni.
Danni, you told me that "I am
going to take care of you.
Trust me."
And I did.
What happened?
Why should I give you my vote?
 You totally could trust me.
And remember I talked to you and
let you know what I heard and
you had let me know what you
heard.
And we kept those lines of
communication completely open
and honest.
We are all here to win a
million.
But everybody's trying to come
out the winner.
And sometimes you're gonna have
to do some lying or manipulating
or something in part of the game
to try to outwit.
And sometimes you have to do
that-- it is a game.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Lydia.
Cindy.
 I will do Danni first.
If you could remove one of the
jury members, who would it be,
and why would you want that
person eliminated from the jury?
 Definitely it would be Rafe
because I know for sure he is
voting for Stephenie because
they've had that bond since the
very, very beginning.
And of course you want to win.
So that's who I would remove.
 That's pretty honest.
Um, same thing for Stephenie.
 Oh, my God.
I don't know.
If I had to take somebody off
the jury, I guess it would be
Bobby Jon because he was the
first one that made the jury.
That's my answer.
I don't know.
I wouldn't want to take anybody
out of the game.
 Okay.
That sounds okay for me.
 PROBST: Thanks, Cindy.
Rafe.
 Um, first off,
congratulations on being the
final two.
You two were really like sisters
to me out here.
And like I am proud that one of
you is gonna win a million
dollars tonight.
I'm gonna go with Danni first.
You said, "Rafe, if I ever get
in a situation where I am in the
final three and I can take the
person I think I'll beat over
the person I think deserves to
win, I'll take the person I
think deserves to win."
So, I'm wondering what happened
when you had that decision right
in front of you and made the
opposite of what you said you
would make?
 Well, first of all, one thing
that changed my mind was during
that immunity challenge
yesterday, I saw Stephenie over
there crying, her legs shaking,
giving everything she could.
She said, "I'm not stopping
until I pass out."
And I felt like somebody who
came into the game who had a
target on their back from the
very beginning who fought
through all the odds shows
that she really is the best
player.
I mean, she knows how to play
the game.
So, I mean, it's a toss-up
between who was the strongest
between the two.
Or even who's the most
deserving.
Because I think either one of
you would be just as deserving.
 Okay.
That's good.
I wanted to understand why that
decision changed.
And I think you answered that.
Steph, I think that you have
kind of given a clear reason why
you should win this game is that
you dominated it in terms of
strategy.
You were the reason that a lot
of people were voted out.
And I, as a competitor really
respect that.
And I was the one who knew it
most because we talked strategy
all the time with each other.
What I am interested to hear
from you is what you think the
best strategic decision or move
you made in the game was that
you didn't tell me about.
 Hmm.
I honestly do not think there
was one.
You are the only person I was
completely honest with in this
entire game.
 Okay.
Steph, I really would like to
know why you think you should
beat the other person in your
closing comments.
Like why you think you should
win.
 Okay.
Thanks, Rafe.
 Thanks.
 PROBST: Thanks, Rafe.
Judd.
 First of all, I want to
congratulate you.
Good job well done.
First, Danni.
I want to know if you've ever
went roller-blading or ice
skating before?
 Roller-blading or ice
skating?
 Have you ever ice skated or
roller-bladed before?
 I've done both, yes.
Not very well.
 I think you're one of the
best ice skaters I've ever seen.
'Cause I believe your strategy
was to just skate right through
this damn game like you did.
The second question is were you
deceitful?
Were you a backstabber?
Were you a liar?
 The one time that I did lie,
Jamie came up and asked me who I
was going to be voting for that
night.
And I told him I would put
Gary's name down.
So, I lied in that situation.
And another time Brian asked me,
"Who are you gonna vote for?
Who are you gonna vote for?"
And I just plain flat told him I
didn't know just because I
didn't want to be there to be
much confrontation.
 To me it sounds like you just
lied a lot.
So I would suggest when you get
back home, first thing you do is
go to confession.
 You know, it's funny, Judd.
Because I do ask forgiveness
every day because it's not just
lying everyday that we do.
Believe me, I do ask
forgiveness.
I ask forgiveness everyday about
everything.
 Good answer.
Steph, I want to know if you are
still starving?
 I'm starving.
 I mean, you have eaten more
than I have eaten when I'm home.
I have been to three immunities
and all you sit there and say is
you're starving.
I'm like, starving?
This girl won four challenges.
 I love to eat and you know
that.
 Well, the only thing you
should be starving for right now
is my damn vote, man.
 And I am, Judd.
 Basically, your strategy in
this game was just to backstab,
man, and lie and be deceitful.
 That's not true.
 Everybody that walked by you,
man.
You backstabbed this one,
that one, that one, that one.
I think you backstabbed
everybody in this game.
 No, I didn't.
 But you crossed the line,
man, when you lied to my wife,
man, and you said that we have
the strongest alliance here, and
that was crossing the damn line,
man, and you should've just
never opened your damn mouth,
man, when my wife got there, so
not only did you lie to me, man,
you lied to my wife, and that's
pretty brutal.
And I'm gonna promise you
something tonight and I'm gonna
stick to my promise.
 Judd, can I respond to that
or do you not want a response?
 Of course.
Absolutely.
 Um, I actually didn't lie to
Kristin.
We had a strong alliance.
I planned on going to the end
with you.
 Yeah, but you lied to her.
 I wasn't lying at that
point.
 How's that not a lie?
Evidentially, you're there and
I'm here.
So you lied.
 I had no idea I was going to
vote you out.
It wasn't my idea.
Listen, first of all, Danni came
to Rafe and I said, "I just want
you guys to know that Judd was
trying to get Rafe and then me."
 Yeah, but I never told
anybody about I was targeting
you or Rafe.
They came up to me and asked who
was the biggest threat and all's
I said to them was, "Wow, man,
you shouldn't be in this damn
game if you know who the biggest
threat is."
But I like your answers.
Thank you.
 All right.
I'm sorry.
 PROBST: I've got to say after
39 days out here with the level
of competitors that are in this
game, the way they handled you
guys tonight, I don't think you
can ask more from a jury.
So you do have one last chance
to convince these guys of why
you deserve the million dollars.
I'm gonna give you a minute to
think about it.
 PROBST: Okay.
You heard from the jury, very
candid jury.
Good questions.
Asked you to be honest.
You know what they want to hear.
They want to hear why you
deserve it.
Closing statements.
Steph, you're first.
 Okay.
I just want to thank all you
guys for your questions and
comments and now I'd like to
prove to you why I think, um, I
deserve your vote.
First of all, I think the game
Survivor is, um, it's the
hardest game anyone will ever
play, and, you know, it's gonna
bring out some of the worst
qualities in people.
But it doesn't mean that we're
bad people.
And I know that I hurt a few
people along the way and I
sincerely do apologize.
But the fact is I came to this
game with a plan and it was to
ally myself with great people
and to try to always have the
numbers on my side and to stay
completely calm at all times.
I never let anybody make
decisions for me.
You know, fortunately, or
unfortunately, I had to take a
leadership role in this game,
and I think that I outwitted and
outplayed and outlasted the best
that I knew how to, and that's
why I am sitting here in the
final two and that's why I would
be honored to have your votes as
the Sole Survivor.
 PROBST: Danni?
 Um, I came into a merge with
this top, you know, six alliance
targeting me.
I thought my head was on the
chopping block, and I didn't
want to scramble too soon.
I wanted to... to sit back and
see who was in control of the
game, and it was clear Stephanie
and Rafe were completely in
control of the game and they're
the reason why each one of you
guys are sitting up there right
now.
And I thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna try to align with the
strongest," and we ended up
becoming friends.
I mean, I really got along with
them great, and ended up getting
that bond, because otherwise, I
would have been gone.
So I feel I really did outwit
and I definitely outlasted.
And, um, I would appreciate
your, uh, your vote tonight,
absolutely.
And, like I said, there's no
reason why I should say I
deserve a million dollars over
anybody else, but it'll
definitely go to good use.
 PROBST: Okay, let's get to
the vote.
Tonight, you want to see your
name on the parchment.
Tonight, the jury is voting for
a winner-- the person they think
most deserving of the title of
Sole Survivor and a million
dollars.
For the last time it is time to
vote.
Bobby Jon, you are up.
 ( whispering ): I always kept
my promises, you never did.
I promise I ain't voting for
you.
 ( whispering ): This game is
about who you are.
Your character is your strategy.
And Stephanie, you made the most
of your strengths and you turned
your weaknesses into strengths
out here.
You are the ultimate Survivor.
 PROBST: I'll go get the
votes.
 PROBST: Congratulations on
surviving a long and tough 39
days here in Guatemala.
The jury has made their
decision.
The votes will remain a secret
until we get back to the U.S.
See you there.
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: All right.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Let's get to the
votes.
(cheering and applause)
Jury... thanks for a good final
Tribal Council.
Steph, Danni... waited a long
time to see what's in here.
Well, wait no longer.
Here's what's at stake for the
winner.
2006 Pontiac Torrent, one of the
ones I think Cindy chose not to
give away.
Also at stake, title of Sole
Survivor and a check for one
million dollars.
( cheers and applause )
 PROBST: Tonight, just to be
clear, you want to see your
name.
These are votes for a winner.
There are seven votes, it takes
four to win.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Danni.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Steph.
One vote Danni.
One vote Steph.
Danni.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Two votes Danni, one
vote Steph.
Danni.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: That's three votes
Danni, one vote Steph.
It takes four votes to win.
The winner of Survivor:
Guatemala-- Danni.
( cheering and applause )
 Thank you, guys.
( cheering and applause )
