         PROBST: Tom leading.
 All right here we go!
Pick it up!
 PROBST: Tom wins first
individual immunity.
Tom's got it!
 I hit him with a machete.
 Oh my God!
 Wham!
He keeps whomping me.
You know you can only taunt








me so long before
I strike back at you.
 The difference between
Tom is he's a man.
He's a man among men.
 PROBST: Welcome back to the
Survivor: Palau Reunion Show.
For the first time, we have all
20 of this season's survivors
back together.
Great season.
Going to cover as much as we
can, starting with Tom.
Congratulations.








Thank you, Jeff.
( cheering and applause )
Thank you.
And all of you, thank you.
 PROBST: And, obviously, this
is your hometown.
You've got a lot of
crowd support out there.
 Yeah, New York! Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: And I got to say,
Tom, you know, well deserved.
It was a season that there was
a lot of domination.
Your tribe, Koror, dominated.
You guys won 11 of 14
challenges, a Survivor record,
and you won five of seven
individual challenges,
also another record.
So you cannot say
you don't deserve this,
you didn't play it well.
What was the plan going in?
'Cause you had a very clear
strategy of how to get here.
 You know, actually,
the way that this played out,
I owe to a good friend of mine,
and my wife, most importantly,
who, when I started concocting
plans of the role I would play
out there in Palau, and they
both just slapped me around and
said, you've got to go in there
and be yourself,
it's a winning strategy.
I thought I was going to be able
to hide underneath my gray hair,
and, uh, you know, it didn't
happen too well.
So I kind of, if anything,
I played a lousy strategy game
'cause I didn't hide well.
So, it all just had...
 PROBST: This...
 to play it all out.
 PROBST: This is why you won,
right there.
That answer of saying nothing,
but just... continually not
offending anybody.
( laughter )
But, obviously, the two people
next to you-- key:
The relationship with Katie and
Ian formed at the beginning?
 First night.
 PROBST: Very unusual to see
an alliance make it that long.
 Right.
 PROBST: And, Katie,
let's address the fact
you took a lot of heat
in that final Tribal Council.
 You think?
( laughter )
 PROBST: And... Gregg.
Where's Gregg?
This is what I want to know.
She made a good point of saying,
look, I'm not the most
physically gifted,
but my strategy was to find
two people strong
and attach myself to them.
Why was there so much animosity?
 You know, it's... there was,
and it's unfortunate, because...
when I was on the other side,
outside of the game, I looked at
these people as characters,
and I didn't take into account
the personal relationships
that I had.
And I can tell you that Katie,
for 33 days, for me,
she did entertain me,
she was my friend,
and she articulated her strategy
very well.
And, I mean, I love her,
and I love our friendship.
And for some reason, she was
just a character over there,
and I laid into her,
and I feel horrible about it.
 PROBST: Well, and you also
said something to me before the
show that as far as you were
concerned, the game wasn't over.
And you wanted them
to earn this vote.
 This game is about being
accountable for your actions.
And I do believe, in the context
of the game, that you need to...
you need to pay the price
to keep the game pure.
And you need to put people
in the hot seat, and I can tell
you that as soon as
I asked my question, you know,
to Katie, I lost focus.
I didn't know what was going on.
But as soon as we cast our votes
I went over and I gave both of
them a hug and a kiss,
and I said, "Great game."
You know, "This is what it's...
this is what it's about."
That was my last move.
But, you know, my last move
was that question.
But the hug and kiss
was where it mattered.
 PROBST: Katie...
you seemed completely surprised
by the animosity towards
you, which surprised me,
knowing what I saw,
even at Tribal Council,
there were a few people
you should have...
you could have naturally assumed
were not going to like you,
based on what you said
about them and making...
Janu comes to mind,
you know, first.
So why were you so surprised
that there were going to be some
people frustrated with you?
 Well, I wasn't surprised
by Janu-- I went in knowing
I wasn't, probably,
going to answer her question.
Um...
 PROBST: That's another thing,
while we're on it.
You make it all the way... you
make it all the way to day 39.
There are seven votes.
It takes four to win,
and you gave one up.
You just gave it up.
 I didn't give it up.
I mean, I knew going in,
there was...
How many times did I say,
"I will not win against Tom"?
I tried to take him out.
I love him, but come on.
You can't beat this guy.
 PROBST: Janu, was your
mind made up?
 It was, Jeff.
 PROBST: It was. All right.
( laughter )
 Sorry.
( applause )
 PROBST: Tom, I thought there
was an interesting thing going
on between you and Gregg--
to show you how quickly
the game can flip.
You guys both approached this
with a lot of game theory--
that is, trying to figure out
what the other person's best
move is and making your move
based on that.
Gregg, that was the case
with you, right?
 That was all my prep, yep.
 PROBST: You said you would
sit up at night
and think about everybody
and what they were going to do.
 I would go through, you know,
the line that we were
sleeping in-- "Okay, what's
Caryn's best move right now?
What's she thinking?
What is she going to do?"
And try to make my move subtly
by making... assuming everyone
else is playing logical
and gonna make the smart move.
 PROBST: And your plan was to
get to five and make your move.
 That's right, worked well.
 PROBST: Tom figured...
( laughter )
Well, you know what?
Tom was telling me--
you figured it out--
that based on what you knew
about Gregg,
why he wouldn't do that.
Tell me about that.
 Um, you know, Gregg really
believes when you're on a plan,
you stick with that plan,
and nothing derides the cart.
And it's that good analytical
thinking that makes him great
in business.
He finds out what's wrong with a
company and where you have
to streamline it.
He had a really good firm he was
working for, Koror Incorporated,
and he didn't want
the partners unhappy.
And he just said, "Let's go,
I've got time.
I've got time,"
so I believed he was going to
stay with it right to the five.
I was told later, "No, no, no,
he's coming for you," so...
but I believed that he
would stay with it
just based on the fact that, um,
he liked the way things
were going, he knew that...
 PROBST: So to be clear,
you figured out,
"He's going to wait till five.
I get him at six."
 I was told
that he was coming for me.
I would've waited to five,
and then, and still played...
I was going to hold to that word
also and just say,
"All right, we'll play to five,
and then we'll start
the picking off."
 PROBST: This is complicated
for me, and I've already talked
to you guys about this stuff,
and now I feel like
I'm getting played.
Caryn, talking about making the
best move, if you make it
to this game--
this is my opinion, obviously,
I've never played it--
but if you make it to five,
without any alliances,
suddenly, you become the most
valuable person on the island.
There are two here and two here,
and you in the middle.
What happened?
How did you go home that night?
Why weren't you guaranteed
a spot in the final three?
 Well, I'm not sure exactly
what happened,
because I wasn't privy
to everything that happened,
but when I wouldn't give up
information on the beach
that Jenn and Katie and I
had made an alliance,
I think I ticked off Tom
and Ian.
I mean, Tom and Ian
were definitely considering--
at least I thought,
I could be wrong--
taking me and getting rid
of Jenn next, but I think when
I didn't give up any information
that it didn't work.
You know, I wasn't useful
to them anymore.
And then Katie flip-flopped
on the all-women alliance,
and so I wasn't useful there
for them, either,
so I went home, I went packing.
 PROBST: Ian?
 Mm-hmm.
 PROBST: You're 11 hours
into a challenge.
You find yourself final three
with your two allies
and the two people
you have betrayed, so severely,
you don't know what to do.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: 11 hours, almost--
yeah, it was 11 hours-- longest
challenge we've ever had,
you finally decide to step down.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Now some will say,
"Hmm, it's a little suspect."
Were you really processing
the whole time?
 Absolutely-- I mean,
there wasn't too much else
to do, unfortunately.
I mean, you're on a buoy,
and, uh... a lot had happened
in the past 24 hours,
and, you know, I came
into the game wanting to play,
you know, from where I'm from
and with the values that I came
to the game with, and I realized
at the 11th hour--
I guess, literally, this time--
that I hadn't been doing that.
And I wasn't ready to sacrifice,
you know, what I was going to
take back to my family
and my friends back home
for a million bucks, so...
 PROBST: And no regrets
on that?
( applause and cheering )
 Absolutely not, no.
 PROBST: Interesting stat,
as, uh, as we go to break
on this segment,
seven of the ten winners
have been 30 years or older.
The average age is 34
of winning this game,
and it brings up an interesting
topic, which is maturity,
because everybody else
was playing this game, too.
Maybe they were playing it
better, but it seemed like you
just grew up a little bit out
there.
 Absolutely, I mean
the game changed my life.
And I had the opportunity
to play with somebody
almost three times my age, so...
( laughter )
So it was, uh, I learned a lot
from the people
that I played with, so...
 PROBST: On that note, up
next, we will hear from
Survivor's favorite hairdresser
Coby.
Still to come, on of the most
popular survivors ever,
Stephenie, but first, this
season's challenges were some
of the most physical ever.
Take a look.
 Come on, we got to go!
 Come on!
 PROBST: Angie dunks Gregg!
Gregg dunking Bobby Jon.
Ooh!
Still on!
Steph!
 Swallow it, Bobby Jon.
 We're not going back
to Tribal Council!
( all cheering )
( screams )
 Oh, my God!
There were three!
( gasps )
( applause and cheering )
 Aw, how cute.
 PROBST: Well, Survivor: Palau
had some big characters,
some big challenges
and some big twists.
We also had
some very big revelations.
We've already talked about Ian's
realization regarding integrity.
Another great story this season
was Coby--
what he proved to others,
what he proved to himself.
You like this pressure,
don't you?
( all cheering )
Coby does it.
 As a kid, I was always called
the girlie-guy, you know,
as a sissy.
People would pick on me,
and I would just give up.
I ended up quitting school
because people made fun of me.
 PROBST: James comes on strong
out of the gate.
Coby fighting back.
 Coby, go!
 But I wasn't going to let
anybody make me quit this time,
no matter how hard it is.
 PROBST: And he's got him!
James is in!
( cheering )
( applause and cheering )
 PROBST: Aw, Coby.
What... was that
part of the appeal?
Did you come out here to try
to get rid of some demons?
 I did-- my demons were, when
I was a kid, you know, I wasn't
popular in school, so Survivor
really is kind of like high
school, so I wanted to be
popular, you know?
I wanted to be the prom queen,
but... but I'm not.
And to be part of a team
was definitely an appeal.
 PROBST: To be part of a team?
 A team-- 'cause I'd never
been part of a team, you know...
That's why this was such a
nightmare, because it started
off as my childhood nightmare
with the pick 'em.
It was awful, it was awful
to watch that happen.
 PROBST: And so you ended
up being part
of the most dominating team
in the history of this show.
 Yeah!
Sorry, Bobby Jon.
( laughter )
 PROBST: And so are
you different?
Did you go home
and have some skeletons gone?
 I did that day.
When they showed me crying,
that day, I completely
put it all to rest.
I really did.
It was the best moment
of my life, one of them.
 PROBST: Wow!
( applause and cheering )
Well, one of the...
I know one of the favorite
moments for me
was a great showdown:
Coby, the gay hairdresser versus
James, the self-proclaimed
redneck from Alabama.
 Come on! Come on.
 PROBST: And you know
what was great
about that was that...
was that you beat James,
and James was so...
You were so complimentary
about it.
I mean, you really were.
And I have to imagine the next
day after that episode aired,
when you went in to work,
your buddies had a couple
of things to say.
This is America--
am I wrong, or not?
 This is America,
and to be honest with you,
I've been unemployed...
( laughter )
'cause I can't get work
because I'm a redneck...
 PROBST: James...
 but I'll tell you what.
Folks I've been around... yeah,
my old friends from the mill,
you know, they saw it,
and I'll tell you what,
I tell them straight up,
"That boy whooped my tail."
He's 210 pounds, 155.
That ain't no excuse,
because I was pure steel
from the steel mill, you know?
And I thought
I was going to whoop Coby.
You know, I'm thinking in my
head, "This is a gay
hairdresser, he's feminine.
I'm going to whoop his tail--
I'm a steel mill worker."
That boy, he's got some tail,
I'm telling you.
Wore me out.
( applause and cheering )
I respect that.
 Thank you, James.
 PROBST: And, James, you know,
you were a big character
out there, and I don't want to
take a long time on this,
but you said something
interesting to me, which was
you actually changed, too.
You said you don't take
your kids for granted anymore.
 Oh, Lord, no.
It changed me.
You know, me and my family--
rocky-- but when I got back,
a lot of things changed.
I went and did with my kids,
I went and roasted hot dogs
and marshmallows,
first thing I did,
and I don't take my wife
for granted no more, neither.
 PROBST: Good.
 It changed me.
( applause )
 PROBST: Another revelation
this season, showgirl, was Janu,
who... you know, this was more
than you bargained for.
It seemed to be.
And you had some tough days,
disappointing at challenges,
laid around camp a lot--
even you would agree with that--
and then your worst
nightmare comes true:
you get thrown on an island by
yourself, and it turns into be
the biggest moment of your life.
 It was great.
It was amazing
to be there by myself.
It was supposed
to be "exile island,"
and it just came together
for me.
It was full circle.
And I learned the appreciation
that I had for family and
friends and life in general
was just that.
I was satisfied.
And I knew, going in to Tribal.
 PROBST: And I want to-- this
is something I haven't asked
you, haven't asked anybody else
who was at Tribal Council
that night.
Yes or no, did I coerce you
into quitting?
 No, you did not.
 PROBST: Anybody at
Tribal Council that night
feel that I did, who was there?
No.
I couldn't have convinced
anybody else to quit.
'Cause the point I'm getting at
is, you know, when somebody--
if you come into this game
thinking you can quit,
you probably will quit, and if
you come to Tribal Council
looking to quit,
you're probably gonna quit.
'Cause if I smell it,
I'm going to find it, 'cause
every time somebody quits,
there's 50,000 people at home
going, "I wouldn't have quit."
So I just wanted
to get that out there
because there's another form
of quit that we're going
to talk about now
which is the engineered quit.
And I'm looking at you, Jeff.
 I knew it was coming.
I was waiting for it.
I'm, like, "Bring it on."
 PROBST: Because there's
another way to get out of this
game and that is to say,
"Vote me out."
And it may not always play
as a quit, but in my world
it's kind of a quit.
And I want to hear you defend
why you should have left
the game with a hurt ankle
when you clearly could have
chopped coconuts, made fire,
tended camp
in a lot of different ways.
 Well, I mean, first of all,
I am officially "Coconut Boy."
I mean, anywhere I go,
anybody that talks to me,
I'm "Coconut Boy."
That's how it goes, I mean...
It can't get any worse
than that.
 That's hot.
 But, for me, it really did
come down to I knew my strength.
I knew my limits,
and, at that point, I had
already injured myself
to the point where I knew
that was it.
It wasn't going to go further.
 PROBST: Okay, what I'm
asking, Bobby Jon saw you, he
walks by-- there's a great
moment in the show
when he sees you
chopping coconuts and says,
"Kim is not doing anything.
Jeff is at least contributing
to camp."
Bobby Jon, would you have left
the game with an injured ankle?
 Uh, you'd've had to cut my
head off and carry it
in a five-gallon bucket...
( loud applause and laughter )
...'cause I wouldn't have left;
I wouldn't have left.
But, you sometimes,
you can't help it, though.
When you get hurt,
I mean, you're injured,
and he just had surgery on it.
So I know he was really hurt.
 PROBST: I'm not debating you
were hurt, don't get me wrong.
I'm just wanting you
to defend it.
 I've defended this a lot,
Jeff.
 PROBST: And you know, Ashlee
on one side of you,
and Kim on the other,
we could possibly make
the same argument for you guys.
Ashlee, would you agree
with that?
That, in some ways, you kind of
had enough of that game.
 Jeff, I completely
had enough of it, yeah.
Unfortunately for me, I thought
that I was tough, but, no.
Not tough enough to last.
 PROBST: All right.
And on the end, two people
who never had a chance to quit,
Jonathan and Wanda,
because you didn't get picked.
Jonathan, you're a more
unlikely target for that.
I mean, I think people look at
you, you're a strong guy,
you're young, you're fit.
What happened?
 I jumped out of the boat.
And, I guess, swimming
against that current
didn't really pan out.
You know, I thought
I was going to swim
twice as fast as the boat,
get to shore, get immunity--
and it just kind of all fell
apart from there, I guess.
 PROBST: So, that's the reason
you didn't get picked is...?
 I mean, honestly...
 PROBST: Angie, you're waving
your arms.
 Um, no,
I don't think that's just it.
Like, I knew this question
was going to come up,
and you seem like a very nice
person now,
but when we were out there,
I think you gave me
one conversation,
and I think the conversation
you gave me wasn't very nice.
And I think maybe that happened
to a few other people,
and the fact was,
you're very nice in person,
but I think when we were
out there, you weren't.
I think you kind of picked and
choosed who you talked to,
and you made a little
bit of enemies that way.
It wasn't just about...
'Cause I never looked at it
like that.
 Yeah, but 20 people going
all in different directions,
right when we get to the beach,
that's kind of hard for,
you know, to form a relationship
with everybody in three days.
 PROBST: All right, all right,
all right, we're not going
to play it out.
But obviously, there's
a little dissension,
and first impressions matter
in this game.
Obviously, Wanda,
you were the other
one on that end of the stick.
And your attitude seems to be,
you're okay with it.
I mean, you went off singing.
Was that true or were you hurt?
 It was devastating,
absolutely devastating,
but they called out, "Sing us
another song, Wanda."
There was some pleasure in it,
even though they had a couple
of curmudgeons who managed
to complain about it.
And so they asked for a song.
I never let my fans down.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Okay, I gotta ask,
Wanda... I have to ask.
I'm guessing
you prepared a song for...
 You betcha.
 PROBST: I hope it's short.
Go for it.
( to melody of "Oh, Susanna"):
♪ We were stranded
on Palauan shores ♪
♪ With coconuts and rats ♪
♪ We survived the heat,
found some food to eat
♪ And some survived the spats ♪
♪ We're survivors, we faced
and passed the test ♪
♪ And in history,

That Survivor Ten was best. ♪
PROBST: No, you're done.
( cheering, whistling )
All right, thank you, Wanda.
She was the first person off the
boat and the last remaining
Ulong member.
One of the most popular women
ever to play this game.
Stephenie is next!
 PROBST: Stephenie, the only
woman left in this challenge.
 I've been an athlete
my entire life.
I'm just not a good loser.
 PROBST: Steph does it again!
 She can do anything
a man can do, I tell you that.
 Oh, wow.
 PROBST: Good old-fashioned
cat fight.
Steph not budging,
and pushes Jenn off easily.
 This is the scariest thing
and the hardest thing
that I'll ever do.
But I'll never give up.
I'm not a quitter.
One coconut.
It's a big one, at least.
( sighs )
( applause and cheering )
 PROBST: Steph, nobody ever
in that situation before--
one tribe member left, spending
the night out on your own.
Did you know going in
that you had that in you?
I mean, you're an athlete.
Obviously, you've been in a lot
of competition, but that
was severe circumstances.
 Yeah, yeah it was. Um...
( clears throat )
I knew I'd be all right
in the challenges
to a certain extent.
I didn't know how I would fare
with no food,
and then losing every single
immunity challenge
was like really...
No, it's not your fault.
Um, that was really,
really tough.
So, no, I mean, I didn't know.
I had no idea I was, you know,
gonna be able to do that well.
 PROBST: Was there a defining
moment, when you think back on
your time out there, where you,
where it all crystallized,
and you knew you were all right?
 It was probably that night
when I was by myself.
It's like, can't get
any worse than this.
I'm the last one left.
I mean, there's nothing...
You know, I'm here by myself.
I don't know
what's going to happen.
And then I got to join Koror.
Then I was, like, forget it,
I can do anything now.
 PROBST: What's been the
reaction on the street from
people?
Because you're one of the most
popular women, certainly, to
ever play Survivor.
( cheering )
 I don't know.
It's weird, you know.
I'm so grateful that
everybody's been so supportive.
Thank you, everybody.
( scattered applause )
Um... it's just, everywhere I
go, people, you know, come up to
me and they say, you know,
"You're my daughter's hero.
You're my hero."
Just a nice thing
to hear, I guess.
I get a lot of letters;
lot of really nice letters
from high school women,
even men.
So I don't know. I don't know.
 PROBST: Yeah, go figure.
Uh, Bobby Jon, your partner...
for some reason,
even though, watching
the Ulong tribe dwindle,
it was kind of fun
toward the end,
because you'd never
seen it happen.
 Absolutely.
 PROBST: I'll admit.
When it got to Bobby Jon and
Steph, it just seemed different.
It seemed like it really was
this tribe of two, and suddenly,
we certainly realized, "Wow,
this has never happened before."
Bobby Jon,
you never got voted out.
 Didn't get voted out.
That's right...
 PROBST: You only are out
of this game
because we had a tiebreaker,
somebody had to go home.
 That's right. I got beat.
Didn't get voted off.
Still feels good,
but you still lose.
And I wear my winning hat
like a man, I wear my losing hat
like a man.
 PROBST: So, no sour grapes?
 No, not a bit.
 PROBST: Hey, where does your
work ethic come from?
Because, if Stephenie's
one of the most popular women,
it's fair to say you're one
of the hardest-working people
that has ever been out there.
You never slacked off.
And that doesn't seem
like a strategy.
That just seems like Bobby Jon.
 That's me;
I would have to definitely
give credit to my family
and the people of Troy, Alabama.
That's all they know
how to do is work.
When you go there, you work.
And I was brought up good.
( applause )
 PROBST: One other, one other
question I have for you.
You got to experience something
that was so spectacular--
Jellyfish Lake.
Did it last?
Did it stay with you?
Is that a moment you can
go back on and remember?
 If you go back in the Rolodex
in your brain, that's the one
I go back to is Jellyfish Lake.
Because, for me,
that was peace.
Not many times people can go
and find peace like that.
And for me it just, it was
really just complete peace.
 PROBST: Jolanda, first person
to win immunity and be the
first person voted out.
 Yep.
 PROBST: And you're obviously
strong and a competitor.
What happened out there?
 I think a lot
of things happened.
The way that
we had to choose tribes
sort of threw off the dynamic,
because I thought I'd get
to pick a team, but I didn't.
I got to pick one,
and I ended up being on a team
full of young adults.
And anyone who's a parent knows
that when they start turning 18,
21, 25, 30, you want to prove to
the world that you know
everything, and they didn't want
leadership, and they didn't want
to be a team,
and we were duplicating effort.
And I knew, when I got voted
off, that we were going
to self-extinct, and I knew it.
I wanted them to do better,
but, I mean, when I go back
to when I was those ages,
I didn't listen, either, so...
 PROBST: Angie, why...
Is she right?
Why was Ulong so unsuccessful?
 She is right about
not listening.
Nobody... I mean,
we'd go to challenges
and we weren't listening.
We'd talk to each other
and we weren't listening.
And it's, it's one
of those things,
like, you see the other tribe
getting together so well
'cause they'd listen
more to one another.
And it was,
it's kind of sad, like...
 Something about our team,
is we totally--
the young people did--
underestimated Koror.
 We had great ideas.
 They're old,
they can't do anything.
And I kept saying,
dude, we're not old.
We think.
We can't run as fast, we can't
jump as high, but we think.
And then we make a plan.
And it was, like,
"No, we got all the muscles.
We're young."
 Oh, I didn't believe that.
 PROBST: Ibrehem,
you told me that you
changed your game plan
because Jolanda was first out.
And you thought, "You know what?
Being strong ain't a good idea."
 Well, I don't think her being
strong was the problem.
I thought that was something
good that we needed.
But I think people couldn't
handle her strong personality.
And I guess I didn't want
to jump out there
and do the same thing and get me
out of the game quick.
 We got put on
a cursed island.
 PROBST: Yeah, yeah, blame
it on the island.
All right, up next, couples
updates from Jeff and Kim
and Gregg and Jenn.
That should be interesting.
Plus for one survivor,
the experience in Palau
led to a dramatic life change,
and we will share that with you.
But first, take a look
at these record number of events
that had never happened before--
Survivor firsts.
 PROBST: Tough to say, but
guys, it is time for you to go.
 We couldn't believe that
we were going back
to Tribal Council.
This has to be a record.
 It was exciting being
the last Ulong member.
At the same time,
it was really scary.
 "Ulong has been conquered
and one more now joins Koror."
 PROBST: We have a tie.
We're tied.
We're tied.
Ian, we're still tied.
 If I don't step down,
I'm gonna beat you.
 That's why I won't step down.
 PROBST: Who are you voting
out of this game?
 I'm going to vote out
my buddy Ian.
( band playing )
( applause and cheering )
 PROBST: By the way, all
the music you hear every week,
on every episode of Survivor
is those guys right there:
Russ Landau,
David Vanacore-- great
musicians and composers.
( applause and whistling )
Okay, Jenn, give me the update.
You and Gregg were a
couple on the island.
Are you a couple now?
 We were on the island.
We had a... a good alliance;
we had a good bond, and it was
a good friendship, too,
and we're still continuing
to be friends,
and let the dust settle
after this whole thing
and see what happens.
 PROBST: All right.
Kim, Jeff, same thing.
You guys posed in a magazine.
Are you a couple now, are
you friends? What, Kim?
 We are amazing friends.
Um, I actually live
out in California now,
and we get the chance to
hang out and have fun,
and a great time on the island.
I'm just glad to have him
in my life as a friend.
 PROBST: Nice!
Hey, one other thing,
I'll put, Willard, with you,
that didn't make the show that I
thought was really interesting--
you're an attorney, but you
didn't tell people that.
You told them...
 I told them I was a mailman,
and I'd actually been a mailman,
a long time ago,
when I was an undergraduate.
But my theory was--
you take a random selection of
Americans, a significant portion
of them know lawyer jokes,
dislike lawyers.
Nobody dislikes the mailman.
 PROBST: And they all
bought it.
You guys didn't know.
( all murmuring )
 Willard told me.
 I told Caryn,
but Caryn was a lawyer, too.
We could smell each other out
like sharks...
( laughter )
 That's exactly right.
PROBST: One other thing
we have to share,
very big surprise with,
I think, everybody here,
except for one person,
and that person is Coby.
You came back home--
big life change.
Tell us about it.
 Well, everybody
keeps saying family
and how important family is.
And one of the other things
that Survivor did for me
was it helped me put away
a lot of the guilt about being
a gay man in society and that
I can't have my own family.
So, when I got back, I started
looking into adoption.
And I was looking
at international adoption,
and my cousin was actually
brave enough to call me,
and odd enough, she was pregnant
and couldn't keep it.
So I actually adopted
a little girl.
( applause, cheering
and whistling )
 So awesome.
 And, and...
 PROBST: One more part
to this story.
 Close...
I named her Janu.
( all sighing )
 That's sweet, man.
 Oh, my God.
( indistinct chatter )
( applause and whistling )
 PROBST: On that note,
where is Survivor going next?
More stories to come.
We'll tell you, right after
this.
( band playing )
( applause and cheering )
( band playing, applause,
cheering and whistling )
 PROBST: Tomorrow morning,
on The Early Show, here on CBS,
Tom will get a check
for a million bucks.
( applause and cheering )
And along with that, you get
something else, which is
a 2005 Chevy SSR.
You guys saw it
out on the island.
Nice little rig, and, uh,
I have the keys right here.
 Nice.
 Cool.
 PROBST: Good hands.
There you are.
( applause and cheering )
 That's too cool.
Well, as Survivor: Palau
comes to a close,
there is a brand-new batch
of newbies waiting to take part
in the greatest adventure
of their lives.
Want to know where they're
going?
Take a look.
Hidden deep in the rain forests
of Central America
stand the ruins
of an ancient civilization
that once prospered...
and then vanished.
These were the Maya people,
and this is the country
of Guatemala.
These stunning cities
of the past stand as clues
to a mystery thousands
of years old.
While Europe
was in the Dark Ages,
it was the Maya who harnessed
the knowledge of the stars
and the celestial movements,
to create a mystical union
of man, nature, and the gods.
It was a world of great kings,
elaborate ceremonies,
fierce battles,
and even human sacrifice.
18 survivors will be marooned
within this mysterious
and rugged terrain.
For the first time, the
castaways will actually live
within the ruins
of a vanished civilization.
And they will be forced
to embrace the ancient
Maya lifestyle.
Join us this fall
as the adventure continues
with Survivor: Guatemala,
the Maya Empire.
( applause, cheering
and whistling )
And if you'd like
to own your very own piece
of Survivor: Palau,
here's how you can do it.
Immediately following
the reunion show, log on to eBay
You're gonna find all sorts
of one-of-a-kind props
and memorabilia,
including the votes and the urn
and torches and all that stuff.
All the money goes
to Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
The auction runs from May 15--
tonight-- through May 28.
To date, Survivor fans have
raised almost $1.5 million
to ensure a healthier future
for kids all over the world.
( applause )
Also, if you think
this game looks like fun, and
you'll play with a broken ankle,
then put together
a short little videotape,
give us a peek at your life,
tell us why you think
you'd be good on the show,
and who knows,
maybe this time next year,
you'll be sitting here with
a check for a million bucks.
That's the great thing
about Survivor--
it really could be you.
Everything you need to know
We will see you all
from Guatemala in September.
Good night!
