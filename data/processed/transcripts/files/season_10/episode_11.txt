         JEFF PROBST: Previously on
Survivor:
 What are we, junior high,
Katie?
 PROBST: Janu was fed up with
her tribe.
 If I had something to say
about you, I swear to God I
would come up and say it to your
face.
 Janu is crazy.








She's a crazy person.
 PROBST: Survivors ready.
At the reward challenge...
Go!
...the tribe was randomly split
into two teams of four...
Janu going out to help.
...and battled for the chance
to partake in a traditional
Palauan feast.
Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg win
reward.
( cheering )
And all talk of strategy was








put on hold as they shared in a
feast of local delicacies.
 Oh, my gosh, barbecue.
 PROBST: Back at camp,
Stephenie realized immunity was
more important than ever.
 I definitely need immunity
because apparently I'm the
strongest girl, and I'm just as
much as a threat as any of the
guys.
 PROBST: At the immunity
challenge...
You'll all take a spot in the
water.
As the tide begins to rise,
your breathing room will
decrease.
One more thing-- first person
to bail on this challenge
will be taken to a new beach
and abandoned there.
Begin.
After a short struggle, it was
Janu that dropped out first.
Just like that, Janu is out.
And in the end Tom walked away
with the immunity necklace.
That's it.
Tom wins immunity.
Left alone to fend for herself,
Janu struggled with obstacles
she had never faced before.
 This is very hard, and it's
very frustrating.
 PROBST: But she surprised
herself and her mood lifted.
 Right now I'm really happy.
The moon and my fire.
 PROBST: Back at camp...
 Stephenie is a bigger threat
than Janu.
 PROBST: ...Gregg led the
charge to keep Janu and vote out
Stephenie.
 Stephenie is a physical
threat.
She's got a strong will, she
wants to win this game.
 We all agreed it was Janu
tonight, but for some reason
I have a feeling it's me.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Stephenie's worst fears were
realized when it became clear
that she was next to go.
 The game is on and
eliminating competition is part
of this game.
 PROBST: Stephenie, do you
feel you're in a hot seat
tonight?
 ( crying ): I know I am.
I guess I showed too much heart
and too much will.
 PROBST: But Janu threw a
wrench in the tribe's plan.
 I would be willing to lay
down my torch so Stephenie can
have a chance to stay in the
game.
 PROBST: Janu, per your
wishes, this game is over for
you, but you will not go home,
you'll return and be a part of
our jury.
 Thank you, Jeff.
 PROBST: Seven are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
(theme song playing)
♪ ♪
 What the hell was that?
 When I got back, I felt a
little uncomfortable.
It's just wrong that they were
going to vote me out and this
girl that doesn't even want to
be here, Janu, they're gonna
keep around, just because she's
easy, you know, later?
I'm getting pissed off now.
She's not around, she's
basically saying, "I don't want
to be here."
And she's sitting here saying...
I don't know what the hell she
was saying.
I couldn't stop her.
I don't know who to trust.
I don't know who to talk to.
I almost don't want to talk to
anybody.
I'm not going to shoot myself
in the foot, though.
 But you know what?
Let me tell you.
It would have gone the same way.
She would have been going home.
 You think?
 After what happened.
 I didn't think so. Really?
 We came back to camp.
Tom played it off like, "Hey,
you know what?
We were gonna change our vote,"
and it was just, like, you
know, comfort Stephenie,
make sure that she feels
welcome and not disrupt tribe
camp.
 I would like to point
something out.
My immunity became a moot point
tonight since it wasn't used,
but somebody did earn their own
immunity.
That self-preservation speech.
So for tonight, that's yours.
 Oh, stop it.
I didn't earn this.
 Katie, Tom, myself and Ian,
we had a four-strong alliance
and now all of a sudden all the
tables are turning and I'm,
like, "What's going on?
Who's switching?"
I don't know, but whether I go
next or not, I will get to the
bottom of it beforehand.
 That was ridiculous.
 I'm upset by the fact that we
didn't vote Stephenie out when
we should have, which is the
first round, and by keeping her
around, she influences the team
dynamic and it scares me because
Stephenie progressing
in this game means that Koror
falls apart and starts to stab
each other in the back.
 So, is the four strong gone?
Is that...
The original four--
me, you, Tom and Ian.
I mean, who's running
the show here, Gregg or Ian?
Not me. Somebody is.
Katie acts like she's my
friend and I can trust her.
And then I go to talk to her,
and she's, like, "I don't know,
I don't know who's leading."
She won't tell me anything,
so I need to talk to Tom.
 You know, this game keeps
getting shaken up, and you know
that.
 I know.
 The promise I made you on day
two was that we'd try to ride
this, but if we got split up,
we'd look out for each other.
 Yeah.
 I swear, I'm still trying to
look out for you.
 That was totally what...
 I just can't expose myself.
 Mm-mm.
 But I'm just, I'm looking
for an opening.
 You're showing yourself way
too much as a survivor, is what
you are. But, um...
 Yeah.
It just pissed me off to make
it this far...
 I'm looking for a chink in
the armor.
 I know.
 There's a reason why
Stephenie has survived as long
as she has.
She's got great instincts.
I really see her as one of the
supreme players.
Now she's looking for her way,
though, to stay in the game,
being the true survivor that she
has demonstrated herself to be,
um... she's going to start
working on things and that's a
problem.
Probably the safest thing for
all is for Stephenie to leave.
 It sucks, you know?
It's scary.
 I know.
 It's a scary feeling.
 I think I'm in the same
position where I'm gonna be the
threat and they're gonna come
after me.
I've said this to a few people,
we're all here.
I'll say it again.
I'm pleading for my life, before
we even get to that stage of the
game, but my strength in the
challenges, it's part of what
got us to this point.
Don't penalize it because I
didn't hide it.
And nobody has won the million
dollars who's been a strong
winner of any of those rewards.
It's always, always somebody
else.
I'm just saying, keep that in
mind.
Don't just, I mean, don't give
me the "Tom's a threat, we got
to get rid of him" line.
I'd hate to go under those
terms.
I said, "Listen, my game was
revealed because I was playing
real hard for the tribe."
I said, "Don't hold it against
me now and don't make me pay for
coming out so strong early."
All right, I think we're of one
mind.
And I'm just hoping that these
people don't hold it against me
to that level that, uh, I'm
finished.
 What'd you guys think of his
little plea this morning?
 Mm...
 Kind of...
 I'm not sure it was that
encouraging.
 It totally, it totally, I
mean...
The fact that he's winning
totally makes him a target.
 I know, and he's, like,
"Don't make it.
No one has ever won..."
 There's a reason that no
one's ever won.
 Right.
 Because they get voted off.
 Right. Exactly.
 Tom's plea, that did nothing.
The plea, you know, "Oh, I
brought this tribe," you know?
"Helped this tribe get as far
as we got," you know?
Yeah, whatever-- you're the one
that said it's an individual
game now.
So that's what we're playing,
buddy, sorry.
I know that I'm aligned with
people that are really good,
so to go up against people that
are really good in the game,
that's a challenge for me.
If any time, this would be the
time to switch over.
 Would you really want to do
that to Gregg?
 To get farther, I mean...
 The person we really need to
talk to is Caryn, 'cause she
could end up going with them.
I think it's an awesome idea.
 It'd be crazy.
 They're already outnumbered.
 Jenn and Steph and I
discussed the fact that we have
four women and three men here,
so we were just kind of
entertaining the thought that
maybe if we all got together,
we could have some power here.
 But we haven't talked to
Caryn about it, so now I have to
discuss it with her.
Say you've got immunity.
Who would be the first one you
would want off?
 Mm-hmm.
 I'll do it if you guys are
game.
( all talking at once )
I... I don't think I'm that big
of a threat.
No matter how threatening you
think I am, those three men
are more threatening, and, um...
if I get voted out next, no
matter what kind of
relationships they think they
have, when it comes to a
million dollars, you can think
you have the best relationship
in the world, doesn't matter.
Those guys will take you out.
 Food.
 Yeah.
 I can be a good persuader,
manipulator, so I work my
angles when I can and I hope
I've shown them all.
Really.
You want, you want to think I'm
a threat?
I'll show you how threatening I
am.
 Tree mail, anyone?
 Tree mail!
All right!
 "The rewards you play for
today mostly involve eating and
drinking.
The only way to the good stuff
will involve strategic
thinking."
 Oh, my God.
 Maybe we get money and we buy
stuff.
 A tree mail came in a
little...
it looks like a purse
or a-a money folder,
and we really think today might
be the day where they give you
"X" amount of money and we get
to spend it on, mostly, food and
drinks.
So the fact that it says
"mostly" to me means that there
may be some other things.
Right now I think I need a
little food for the soul, and,
uh... anything from home
would-would serve that purpose.
 PROBST: Take a seat.
Find your name and sit next to
the wallet.
Everybody's got a wallet.
You've got $500 inside.
 Oh, wow. For real.
 Oh, wow! It's real money.
 PROBST: U.S. currency, same
currency used here in Palau.
That is yours.
You can leave here with it, or
you can spend it at the Survivor
auction.
I'm going to bring up a series
of items.
Bidding will start at $20 and it
will raise in increments of $20.
The auction will stop without
warning so if you see something
you like, you better bid on it
and not hope for something
better to come up later.
Clear?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Get to the first
item.
 Oh, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
 PROBST: There it is.

 Take a bite of that.

 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Chocolate,
cherries...
( laughing )
 That's ridiculous.

Sold to Caryn and Steph.
Come on up.
Now, you have bought this.
This is yours to split.
 Right.
 PROBST: Okay? We'll just set
it right here, just for a
moment.
 Oy.
 PROBST: You have five
seconds.
Do you want this, which you own,
or do you want to trade it for
this?
( sniffing )
( women whispering )
 Uh...
 PROBST: What do you want?
 This one.
We're gonna trade.
 PROBST: You're going to trade
this, which you bought, for
this.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Here's what you
bought, crackers and cheese.
 I love crackers and cheese.
 PROBST: But, using your
senses, which are so acute out
here, you made the right choice.
( winners shrieking )
Cheeseburger, fries and a soft
drink.
Take a bite of this.
 Can we cut it in half?
 PROBST: Yeah.
 Oh, it's a double.
 I'm so glad I smelled,
Stephie.
 Yeah, you did great.
You smelled the fries.
 Hang on, hang on.
 I'm dipping. A little dip.
 Okay?
 Cheers.

 PROBST: Before you get up,
let me make you another offer.
Here's what you bought for $300.
If you want, you can trade it
for what's in here.
Going to stick with what you
bought?
All right.
This is what you bought.
Let me show you what you didn't
buy.
Hate to disappoint you.
This is what you did not buy.
 Ew...
 That's what I didn't buy.
 PROBST: That's what you
didn't buy.
We'll put the crabs back.
 Good instincts.
 Nice.
 PROBST: Come on up.
Let's take a look at what you
did buy.
Gregg making sure to get his $20
in.
 Smells really good, looks
really heavy.
 PROBST: Are you ready?
 Yeah.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: The home run.
Spaghetti with meat sauce,
garlic bread, Parmesean cheese.
 Oh. Ohh...
 PROBST: Aw, please.
Take a bite.
Wow, you smell, Ian.
Wow! You reek.
 You tell him!
 Yeah, you tell him!
 We tried.
( all talking at once )
 Oh, sorry.
 That looks so good.
 Oh, my God.
This is phenomenal.
 PROBST: Enjoy.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Gregg's eyes have
not left that plate.
 God, so much cheese.
 Maybe I'll have to take a...
 Go ahead, take your bite.
A $20 bite, Gregg.
Remember, this was 300 bucks.
 PROBST: Ready for another
item?
 Yeah.
 What is that?
 A beer.
 PROBST: One cold beer.
First $40 gets it.
 I got it.
 PROBST: Ian.
Sold to Ian. 40 bucks.
 Doesn't do much for me.
 PROBST: Crack that thing
open.
 Oh, man, that's good, Tom.
That's good.
 PROBST: Ready for another
item?
 Yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 PROBST: Go with something a
little different.
 There's got to be letters in
there.
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Ian's right, letters
from home.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: One for everybody

Could be some wisdom, definitely
going to be some love.
Steph thinking about it.
 $200.
 PROBST: $200 to Gregg.
 Sorry, Mom and Dad.
 PROBST: $220 to Tom.
 Sorry, Paul.
 PROBST: $220 to Tom.
Going once...
Twice...
Sold to Tom.
Letter from home.
Well spent?
 Thanks.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Going to read that
now or you going to take it home
and read it later?
 I know I'm going to peek.
 PROBST: $220, a lot of money
for a letter from home.
( Stephenie laughing )
 Connor's hand.
This is what I needed.
This is my nourishment,
and it was money well spent.
 PROBST: $220 is what it cost
Tom to get his letter from home.
Anybody else wants theirs for
the same price, you can have it.
 I'll take it.
 I'll take it.
 I'll take mine.
 PROBST: Letter from home for
Caryn.
There you go.
Enjoy.
 Thank you.
Oh.
Thanks.
 PROBST: A lot of good stuff
in there.
 Yeah.
 Oh, geez.
I got to read it later.
 PROBST: You just peeked
inside.
 My whole family.
My boyfriend.
I can't read it now.
I'll lose it.
 PROBST: This auction is over.
 Yes!
 No cheese and crackers?
 PROBST: We're done.
The game is back on.
Head on back to camp.
 Thanks, Jeff!
 Thanks!
 PROBST: See you.
 Nice spending time with you.
 PROBST: Yeah.
One of the few days you like me.
 You're right.
 Great reward challenge.
Got letters from our families.
I have letters from all four of
my brothers, my sister-in-law.
My beautiful nieces and nephews,
my parents, my boyfriend.
I have, like, 12 letters.
I come from a great family,
strong group of people who have
always been positive and very
motivational and that's why
I am the way I am and it just
makes me try all the harder
just to stay in this game.
I feel like I've conquered so
much, but I want it all.
I mean, there's been talk,
us girls may get together,
but you can't trust anybody.
Having these letters is all the
food and all the energy I need
because I will read these
letters and I will think
of these people, and I'll go in
there like wildfire and I will
win this.
I know it.
 I'm taking a bath.
 Whoo!
 Heard it before.
 Believe it when we see it.
Hey, hey, hey.
 Jeff commented that I reek
pretty bad, so today is bath
day, in honor of Jeff Probst,
who noted that I definitely
stink.
I may need you to help me out.
 With what, your back?
 Yeah.
I just can't see it.
I have long, monkey arms, but I
couldn't get all the dirt off
my back so I asked Gregg to
help me out.
Thanks, buddy.
 Filthy, dude.
 Is it coming off?
 The picture out there with
the men bathing each other,
loofahing.
I think it's pretty comical.
I think they could have asked
a girl to loofah their backs
if they wanted to.
 So Ian and Gregg had a little
moment out in the water.
Maybe that's the secret alliance
we don't know about.
You never know.
 Thanks, dude.
Had a Grecian bath.
I think we were totally made fun
of for that one, but I'm
comfortable with my sexuality.
It's not a big deal.
Hey, can you check my neck and
just make sure there's no, like,
real big brown spots back there.
 No, there are and I'm not
going to clean it for you.
But you look nice and clean.
 Good.
 I know that the target's on
me, I know that that's coming.
I'm anything but confident in
the game.
I just, you know, right now I'm
in an okay position, but that's
going to change this afternoon.
 Mm-hmm.
 So this is... I mean, you
have this alliance and it gets
you through to the end,
but you think Ian wants to deal
with me?
You think I want to deal with
Ian?
 Right.
 I know that a lot of the
tribe members are going to be,
like, "This may be our last
chance to take him out.
Let's do it right now."
So I'm prepared for that.
My only protection is to keep
the five tight, and I've also
got to bring in Caryn as a
confidante.
If there's a little trouble
brewing for me, I want Caryn to
think that I'm looking out for
her interests, she's looking out
for mine.
And I know that the target's on
me.
I still think your good move
would be to be, like you say,
there's a strong five, be the
strong sixth yourself with us.
 Mm-hmm.
 Talk to me before you make
that jump.
 Tom is my in right now, and
Tom said to me, "Caryn, I'm
going to watch you as long as I
can."
He said, "I want you to go as
far as you can."
I feel like you've worked really
hard to keep me in the game.
I'm just not going to bite the
hand that's been feeding me.
 All right, well, I appreciate
that.
I think we do have some kind
of a sympathetic thing going
where we're going to look out
for each other for the best that
we can.
 Right.
 So it was a good move on my
part to be friends with Caryn.
What happens, happens at this
point.
You know, you just, you play
your cards as best you can.
If I don't win the immunity
challenge, I'll be ready to see
my name written a few times.
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: Okay.
Let's get to today's immunity
challenge.
First things first, Tom.
Give it up.
Immunity once again back up for
grabs.
For today's immunity challenge,
you're going to be up on a
platform.
20 feet away is a wooden grid.
On that grid-- ceramic tiles.
There are 35 tiles-- that's five
tiles for each of you.
Using coconuts, you're going to
toss the coconut and attempt to
knock out one of your tiles.
If you take out somebody else's
tile, that counts for them.
First person to break all five
of their tiles or have their
tiles broken by somebody else
wins immunity.
Lose, Tribal Council tonight.
This game will end for somebody.
We'll randomly draw for colors.
Get your names up on the board
and we'll get started.
All right, Ian.
You're in the number one slot,
going for red.
Choose your weapon.
( sighs )
Goes small.
First shot.
Look at that!
 Oh, man.
 PROBST: Off the bat, Ian is
on the board.
 Good one.
 PROBST: Katie up, going for
brown.
Launch...!
Oh.
Gregg, looking for a blue tile.
 Wow!
 PROBST: Gregg takes out his
first tile.
Gregg on the board with one.
Jenn is up, going for orange...
 Thank you!
 PROBST: ...and instead
she takes out Caryn...
 Thank you, Jenn.
 PROBST: ...with the white
tile.
Caryn on the board with one,
hasn't even taken her first
shot.
You could jump into the lead.
Going for white.
Just short.
Tom.
He's won back-to-back
immunities.
Going for green.
 Whoo!
 PROBST: And instead he takes
out Katie.
 I'm on the board.
 PROBST: Stephenie with her
first shot going for yellow.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: And instead she takes
out Caryn.
At the end of one round, here's
where we're at: Caryn in the
lead with two, taken out by Jenn
and Steph.
Ian, Gregg and Katie with one.
Jenn, Tom, Stephenie not yet on
the board.
Ian back up, looking for red.
And he does it.
Ian now with two.
Katie going for brown.
 Damn!
 PROBST: Katie takes out Jenn.
Jenn on the board with one.
Gregg up, going for blue.
And he takes out another Ian
tile.
 Wow.
 PROBST: Ian now moves into
the lead with three.
Jenn on the board with one,
going for orange.
Looks good... oh! Too short.
 That-a-girl. That-a-girl.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Jenn takes out Tom.
Tom is now on the board with
one.
Caryn going for white.
 Whoo!
 PROBST: And she takes out
Katie.
Katie moving into this game
suddenly now with two.
Tom going for green.
Look at that.
Lofts a nice little one in
there, Tom now moves into two.
Jersey still not on the board.
 "Jersey."
 PROBST: For yellow.
 Come on.
 PROBST: Aw...
( yells )
 PROBST: Nothing.
At the end of two rounds Ian in
the lead with three, Katie,
Caryn, Tom with two, Gregg and
Jenn with one, Stephenie still
at zero.
Ian going for red.
Ian puts himself in very good
shape with his fourth tile.
Katie with two, looking for her
third.
Going for the close one.
And instead she takes out Jenn.
Jenn now in this game with two.
Gregg with one, looking to get
his second.
He's going for blue.
Look at that.
Drilled it.
Gregg now with two.
Jenn is up.
Jenn going for orange.
There it is.
There it is!
 All right, good shot.
 PROBST: Nicely done.
Jenn with three.
Caryn going for white, sitting
on two and she takes out...
 I'm on the board!
 PROBST: Stephenie finally on
the board, thanks to Caryn.
Tom trying to get back in this.
Going for green...
and he does it.
 Tom's getting good at this.
 PROBST: Tom now on the board
with three.
Steph going for the corner
yellow.
Just misses.
 Second time in a row, same
spot.
 PROBST: End of three rounds,
Ian in the lead with four, Tom,
Jenn with three, Gregg, Katie,
Caryn with two, Steph with one.
Ian has one tile left, immunity
at stake.
For the win.
Oh, no!
Yes.
 Man.
 PROBST: Stephenie on the
board with two.
 Yes.
 PROBST: Katie trying to stay
close.
Katie takes out her own, now
with three.
Gregg sitting on two.
Wants to stay in this.
Looking at blue.
Look at that.
 Oh, my God.
 PROBST: Dead on.
Gregg now with three.
He's back in this game.
Jenn sitting on three.
Oh!
Oh!
Hit three tiles and
none of them went out.
Ian hoping somebody will
accidentally take him out, he'll
win it.
Caryn going for white.
 Ooh, short.
 Bad toss.
 PROBST: Tom with three.
Could move him into a tie with
Ian for first.
Going for green.
 Oh!
 PROBST: And instead he takes
out red which is Ian.
Ian wins immunity.
 Thank you.
Thank you guys.
 Damn.
 PROBST: Steph, your toss
doesn't count.
Nobody can catch Ian.
Congratulations.
Ian safe from the vote tonight.
Everybody else fair game.
I'll see you at Tribal.
( thunder )
 So mother nature throws this
little curveball and, you know,
we're gonna have a rainy day.
So I think it would be very
funny if the sun breaks out and
you just see seven people
scatter out of the tent in
individual groups just going to
explode with the things that are
building up inside them
while we're stuck inside.
It's going to be a fun day.
 The girls want to vote the
guys out one by one, so I think
they're just going to tell
Caryn.
So I'm, like, are they really
going take me and us four really
take out the three men?
We'll see.
 Stick with the women and take
out the men, or go with the men
and take the rest of them,
kicking our ass in a big way?
We have four and they have
three.
I hate to do it, but I knew I'd
have to jump ship at some point.
I just didn't know when it would
be.
 Katie asked me if I wanted
to make an alliance with the
girls.
She said, "There's four of us
and three of them and now is the
time to do it."
 And then we'll just see how
it works out from there.
 Right.
 You know, I love Tom.
 Yeah.
 I will cry when I have to
write his name down.
 Me, too.
 But I've accepted that I'm
going to have to write his name
down or else he's going to win.
 I really have to think it
through, I mean...
I've been down with Tom, so
this is a whole new thing that
I really have to think about.
I mean, I don't have, like, the
word "alliance" with anybody.
I'm watching out for Tom.
Tom is watching out for me.
 What's going on?
 I just told you I would tell
you if your name came up and
your name is coming up all over
the place.
 What's going on?
 Um...
 What do you hear?
 Just that the girls are
talking.
 What do the girls say?
 Trying to figure out which
guy to take out.
 And why are you telling me,
as opposed to siding with the
girls?
 Because I told you I would.
 Mm-hmm. I understand that,
just, but, I mean, you also have
to protect your own neck.
You know that you're safer with
me, you must.
 ( stammering ): I'm just
telling you because I promised
you I would tell you.
If I heard anything about you
I said I'd tell you.
 Well, that was Caryn just
letting me know that the girls
are talking about eliminating
some of the guys and that my
name popped up.
I'm still just a little wary
of why Caryn's giving me the
information, you know, she'd be
better off holding on to that
information and just surprising
me.
And Katie said she's ready for
me to go?
 She's not sure.
She was just talking.
She was just throwing around
possible scenarios.
 Okay.
It's an interesting day here.
I've got to get off with Ian,
do a little planning there, too.
 I think everybody's starting
to play the game and Caryn's
kind of telling stories to
everybody and trying to get a
way into a situation where
she can be on top.
So my mind's going about
four-and-a-half miles a minute
and I'm trying to figure out
what the next best move is.
 Caryn's spreading that you're
trying to get all the girls
against the guys.
 I don't know what the (bleep)
you're saying.
 I'm, I'm strong.
Listen, Caryn's spreading a lie.
I'm getting really pissed off.
 I don't like that.
I don't like that she just did
that at all.
That really bothers me.
Caryn went back and told Tom
I was planning to get all the
women, which is not what I was
doing.
I was just entertaining the
thought, but we can't get a
female alliance together because
Caryn sucks.
 I can go Caryn first.
You think it would be better
to get rid of Caryn than Tom?
 You don't have a chance.
I don't have a chance against
Tom, I don't think I have a
chance against you either,
but I'm sticking with you.
If I can avoid writing
your name down until the end,
I'm good with that.
 I'm, I'm still 100% true to
you, like...
 Yeah, me, too.
I-I just feel really bad
about the Tom thing, if you
think about it.
We should take out Tom.
I believe Tom stands a huge,
good chance that he can win
every immunity from here on out,
'cause he's smart and he's
strong.
I just hate for it to be such a
sweep and Tom just takes the
whole thing and none of us have
a chance.
 It's not going to happen that
way.
 I think the biggest obstacle
is getting Ian on my side.
And to vote off Tom, I think I
can get Ian to do that, I think.
Just, I mean, when are you going
to be ready to get rid of Tom?
'Cause every time I bring it up,
you're like...
 Tom realizes that he's the
biggest threat and while I kind
of, you know, I kind of
comforted him through the whole
thing.
That's not the whole way it is;
for me it's very up in the air.
I just want to make sure
you're still good to go.
 Yeah, absolutely.
It's not a question, it's just
who I think should go.
 We need to fill the bucket.
 This is where the game gets
really, really difficult.
Caryn needs to go home,
Stephenie needs to go home,
so my big dilemma today is
do I vote Tom out?
 I think I'm screwed because I
think Ian told Katie that I'm
playing probably both sides of
the fence and so I might be in
trouble.
So, I don't know where I am
right now.
 Stephenie needs to go.
It's already been too much
of a Stephenie show.
She brings a complexity to the
game right now, and the sooner
we get rid of her, the easier
it is for us to go back to what
the plan is.
Don't mess with the plan.
Don't mess with the plan.
I'm going to get pissed off.
I am going to get so pissed off.
 I feel like this whole game
I've had stuff hanging over my
head and I've made it through
somehow.
If these people are smart and
they know how to play the game
for themselves, their best bet
is to not get rid of me tonight.
I've said my peace, I've
planted the seed.
If they're smart, Tom will be
the next one to go.
Whether they choose to go with
it, that's on them.
 PROBST: We now bring in the
members of our jury, Coby and
Janu who quit at the last Tribal
Council, but per the rules, will
remain a part of this jury and
will have a vote at the final
Tribal Council.
30 days in started with 20.
We're down to seven.
Ian, is the paranoia starting
to drift into camp?
 Well, it's starting to creep
in.
I mean, you know, you go to the
bathroom and you're, like, "Hmm,
I wonder if anybody's talking
about me."
But, uh, all in all, I think
it's still a pretty solid
group.
 PROBST: Steph, you narrowly
escaped being voted out at last
Tribal Council.
What was the reaction when you
got back to camp?
Because, clearly, this tribe
wanted you gone.
 I thought it was going to be
really uncomfortable, but it
wasn't.
I hear that they have their, you
know, plans and stuff, but, um,
they made me feel really
comfortable.
And, unfortunately, I don't have
immunity on my neck, but, um,
you know, I'm playing as hard as
I can and whatever is meant to
happen will happen for me.
 PROBST: You're a part of this
group, but you're still a bit
of an outsider.
What's going to happen to this
group as it dwindles and people
start going over to the jury,
bitter that they're no longer in
this happy family?
 I think it's going to be
tough because they haven't
really had to, like, scramble
and start, like, kind of
backstabbing yet, so it's really
getting intense.
Like, people are starting to
notice.
I mean, I've been stressed out
since the first time I came to
Tribal Council, but it's the
game.
 PROBST: Caryn, when did you
notice the intensity pick up?
 Probably the day after the
last Tribal Council.
I started noticing more people
going off and talking,
and, you know, I think other
people have noticed it, too.
 PROBST: So if it's you
tonight, surprised?
 Not all that surprised.
I could be the next one.
You know, you feel like you know
what's going on,
but at any given time, I might
not know what's going on.
 PROBST: Tom, seems like from
early on, you've been somewhat
of a leader on this tribe.
You certainly haven't held back
at any of these challenges.
Was that a conscious decision to
say "I'm going for broke.
"I'm going to let them see I'm
strong and see how it plays
out"?
 No.
Uh, my doing well in any
of the challenges became
happenstance that I didn't
intend.
I thought I was going to hide
behind being a little older
than the crowd, but the need for
Koror to beat Ulong was
paramount, so I revealed my
hand.
Um, you know, I hope it's not
held against me, and I don't
mind that I've come out and
played hard, and I'll live
with those consequences.
 PROBST: Okay, Ian, you have
the immunity necklace.
As always, if you felt
compelled, you could give it to
somebody you thought was in
trouble.
 I'm going, I'm going to keep
it for myself tonight, Jeff.
 PROBST: All right, you cannot
vote for Ian.
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.
Caryn, you're up.
 You're one of the fiercest
competitors I've ever met.
My heart hurts to let you go.
 This is absolutely nothing
personal.
I'm just voting
with the rest of the tribe.
 PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
The first vote:
Caryn.
Steph.
One vote Steph, one vote Caryn.
Steph.
Two votes Steph, one vote
Caryn.
Steph.
That's three votes Steph,
one vote Caryn.
12th person voted out and the
third member of our jury, Steph.
That's four votes.
That's enough.
Bring me your torch.
 Good luck, guys.
 PROBST: Steph, the tribe has
spoken.
 See ya.
 PROBST: It's time for you to
go.
Well, relatively speaking,
another easy vote.
Last Tribal Council, somebody
quit.
This time you vote out the last
remaining Ulong member.
We are now down to six original
Koror members.
This happy family's about to be
broken up.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Good night.
 PROBST: Stay tuned for
scenes from our next episode.
Next time on Survivor:
 Today I think my worst fears
were realized.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, no.
 The next one is the big one.
 PROBST: And paranoia
intensifies.
 I know they're ready to turn
on you.
I know for a fact.
 And you think Katie is in
with it?
 Definitely.
 I don't know what the next
step is.
 I'm really psyched and I'm,
like, really proud of myself
because it was, it was a hard
run.
Our whole tribe just got blown
away person by person, and here
I am the only one left standing.
And I go to this new tribe,
thinking I'm a dead man walking,
and I made it one in seven.
I was outnumbered by an entire
tribe, and I am.
I'm actually really proud.
