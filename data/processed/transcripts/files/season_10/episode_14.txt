         JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago,
20 Americans began the
adventure of a lifetime.
Just behind you, there are
two immunity necklaces.
One for the first woman,
one for the first man, who can
get to shore and claim them.
 I'll go!
 PROBST: From the beginning,
it was clear that these
castaways were in for a whole
new game.
 I was not going to let that
little young girl beat me.
 PROBST: With no other
information to guide them,
no one knew what to expect.
 We're not a tribe, we don't
have our buffs-- we don't have a
clue what's happening next.








 PROBST: We're going to divide
into two tribes with nine
members each.
There are 20 of you.
Two people will get on a boat
and be sent home.
Ian and Jolanda learned the
value of the immunity necklaces
when they made the first of the
schoolyard picks.
 Katie.
 Bobby Jon.
 PROBST: And in the end,
Wanda and Jonathan were left
Go!
At the first immunity
challenge, the Ulong tribe
stumbled with crucial decisions.
 Come on! We gotta go.
 I'm telling you, I think we
should go.
 PROBST: And the older Koror
tribe proved that age didn't
matter when they won immunity
and flint to make fire.
Koror wins immunity and reward!
 Yeah!
 PROBST: At Ulong's first








Tribal Council, Jolanda's
strength did not prevent her
from taking the fall.
Jolanda, the tribe has spoken.
On day four, the tribes battled
it out again.
Ulong made a brief comeback.
Ulong wins reward!
But Koror was soon back on a
roll, winning challenge after
challenge.
Koror wins their third immunity
challenge in a row!
 Whoo!
 PROBST: Koror wins their
fourth straight immunity
challenge!
 Whoo!
 PROBST: James.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: You have not won a
single immunity challenge.
 When we hear the word
"immunity," we subconsciously
sabotage ourselves.
 PROBST: Ulong was losing
members fast.
Even though Koror continued to
dodge Tribal Council, an
alliance of five was exposed.
 Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian
and Tom are one unit.
We're definitely the underdogs
here.
 PROBST: Koror continued their
victory sweep...
Koror wins reward!
( whooping )
...losing only Willard at a
surprise double Tribal Council.
Willard, the tribe has spoken.
Ulong lost Angie...
then James and Ibrehem.
Ulong had dwindled to a tribe
of two.
 You know, we tried to
prepare, we tried to
strategize; nothing has worked
for this tribe, I mean nothing.
 I'm still ready to win,
and I won't give up hope.
 Look at that!
How's that for a shot?!
 Yeah!
( laughing )
 PROBST: At Koror, Tom emerged
as the tribe leader.
 Oh, wham!
 Oh, now, who's the great
white shark killer?
 PROBST: And Bobby Jon and
Stephenie continued to give it
their all at the challenges.
 Swallow, swallow.
Swallow it, Bobby Jon.
 PROBST: But Ulong continued
to come up short.
Tom's got it for Koror!
 It just seems like Tom beats
me every single time.
It's something that's getting
real, real old.
 PROBST: Gregg with a bit of a
lead.
On day 18...
Koror wins immunity again!
Koror won their seventh
straight immunity challenge.
For the first time, one tribe
had made a clean sweep.
Ulong, because there are only
two of you, there'll be no vote.
There will be an individual
immunity challenge.
Loser goes home.
 Whoa.
 PROBST: Stephenie and Bobby
Jon, who had worked so hard
to keep their tribe alive, were
forced to face off against each
other.
Survivors ready?
Begin.
Though Stephenie had doubts
about her fire-making skills...
Steph's torch is lit.
Just like that, this challenge
is over.
Steph.
...she came out victorious.
 See you later, Ulong!
 PROBST: The next day,
Stephenie joined the Koror
tribe.
 Oh, my, God, I have friends!
 Having somebody new in town,
it was like, a guest, you know?
 PROBST: But secretly some saw
Stephenie as a very real
threat.
 I'm really worried.
The longer she's with us, the
more she's gonna make friends,
and she's gonna weasel her way
in.
I think she needs to go really
fast.
 PROBST: But Coby took the
heat off Stephenie when he
exposed too many of the tribe's
secrets.
 All these people are playing
a game.
There's already alliances built.
We're going to pick each other
off.
It's a game.
 PROBST: Tom won the first
individual immunity.
And at Tribal Council, Coby's
loose lips cost him the game,
and he became the first member
of the jury.
On day 25, Janu was on her last
leg and fed up with her tribe.
 What are we, junior high,
Katie?
If I had something to say about
you, I swear to God, I would
come up and say it to your face.
 Janu is a crazy person.
 PROBST: Though Janu seemed
ready to go, Stephenie sensed
that she was in danger.
 I mean, we all agreed that it
was Janu tonight, and Janu
wants it to be her, but for
some reason, I have a feeling
it's me.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Stephenie's worst fears were
realized when it became clear
that she was next to go.
 The game is on, and
eliminating competition is part
of this game.
 PROBST: Stephenie, do you
feel you're in a hot seat
tonight?
 ( voice cracking ): I know I
am.
I guess I showed too much heart.
 PROBST: But Janu threw a
wrench in the tribe's plan.
 I would be willing to lay
down my torch so Stephenie can
have a chance to stay in the
game.
 PROBST: Janu, per your
wishes, this game is over for
you.
 Thank you, Jeff.
 PROBST: In a last-ditch
effort to save herself,
Stephenie agreed to Katie's
plan for an all-girl alliance.
 Who would be the first one
you'd want off?
 You want to think I'm a
threat?
I'll show you how threatening I
am.
 PROBST: But hopes of an
all-woman's alliance crumbled
when Caryn spilled the beans to
Tom.
 What did you hear?
 Just that the girls are
talking.
 What did the girls say?
 Trying to figure out which
guy to take out.
 We can't get a female
alliance together because Caryn
sucks.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Stephenie's hard-fought battle
finally came to an end when she
was voted out.
Steph, the tribe has spoken.
With only original Koror tribe
members left, the real
backstabbing was about to
begin.
On day 31, Gregg won a reward
aboard a luxury yacht.
Obviously, it wouldn't be much
fun alone.
Gregg chose to take Jenn and
Katie along for the ride.
 Guys, I'm so sorry.
I will, uh, pay you back.
 Oh, no, we'll pay you back.
 PROBST: Back at camp...
 We have lost lost control of
the game.
 PROBST: ...Ian realized it
was three against three.
 I know they're ready to turn
on you.
 And you think Katie's in with
that?
 Definitely.
 PROBST: So they concocted a
risky plan to force Gregg out.
 I can go to Tribal Council,
willing to take the rock.
I came to play a game.
 That's the plan.
You and I are both willing to
choose rocks.
 Tom and I have decided that
we're gonna force a tie at
Tribal Council.
We've prepared ourselves for
the idea that we might be going
home, but this is a risk we
have to take.
 PROBST: Meanwhile, Gregg,
Jenn and Katie strategized on
their own.
 We happen to have a good
bond.
This was our opportunity to
confirm that, "Hey, guys, it's
us three to the final three."
 PROBST: But right before
Tribal Council, Ian let Katie
in on the plot to oust Gregg.
 We're gonna flip it tonight.
Yeah, Caryn and Tom and I
are going to vote for Gregg.
There's only two people in this
game that I made promises to.
Tom's one, Katie's the other,
so I'm gonna stay true to that.
 PROBST: Ian's gamble paid
off.
Katie joined Ian, Tom and
Caryn, and voted Gregg out
before the tie could occur.
 ( inhaling ): You guys are
good.
 I got it. I got it.
 PROBST: Jenn was upset that
she had been left out of the
plot against Gregg.
 Wow, okay. Game on.
 PROBST: Ian and Katie's bond
continued to strengthen...
 I did make a promise.
 PROBST: ...when he promised
to take Katie with him on the
next reward he won.
 Katie and I promised each
other if we won a challenge,
we'd take each other and that's
what we're going to do today.
 PROBST: Ian wins reward.
But when Ian won a car and a
trip to a luxury mansion, he
chose to take Tom instead.
 I told Katie I'd take her,
but I made a deal if there was
a car involved, that I would
take Tom.
 PROBST: Katie was furious.
 Ian pulled me aside
yesterday, and was, like, "I'm
telling you right now, I will
choose you over Tom," and then
he took Tom, and I feel like I
lost my best friend out here.
 PROBST: So Katie resurrected
talk of an all-girl alliance.
 If it's Ian, we vote out Tom,
right?
 Right
 And if it's Tom, we vote out
Ian.
 That's right.
I'm all about that.
 I love that.
 PROBST: When Tom and Ian
returned from the reward, Ian
and Katie had an emotional
confrontation.
 You said you would never lie
to me, and you did.
You didn't even think about how
that was going to make me feel
to have you go against your
word.
 Just please know that over
and above the mistake that I
made, that I hope you can
forgive me for it.
If you want me to step out, I
mean, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
 PROBST: Tom stepped in to put
pressure on Katie.
 So one of us goes home, the
other one is still here.
If that next one's physical, and
the guy who's left wins it,
then it's going to be you, and
that'll be the payback for
flipping.
 PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Katie was still wary of Ian.
 That was the darkest day I've
ever had out here.
 It was the biggest mistake I
made in the game.
It was the biggest thing, and
not even from a game standpoint,
but from the fact that I really
hurt somebody that I care about.
 PROBST: And Caryn brought all
of Ian and Tom's game playing
out into the open.
 These guys are running the
game, and I felt really had.
 PROBST: Caryn, you just
opened the vault and put four
people on their heels.
 I'm sorry, I've had it up to
here, and I think the jury
needs to hear really what's
going on.
I mean, they're going to be
deciding who gets a million
bucks.
 PROBST: Caryn's tirade didn't
help her.
14th person voted out of
Survivor: Palau, the fifth
member of our jury.
Katie put her trust into her
friendship with Ian and helped
vote Caryn out.
Caryn, the tribe has spoken.
Now, only four remain:
Ian, Katie, Jenn and Tom.
Tonight, they will compete in
their final immunity challenges.
Two will go on to face the
jury.
One will outlast all the rest
and become the Sole Survivor.

 Day 37...
True colors came out last night.
Caryn did me a huge favor
last night by going off and
throwing all this stuff out
there.
I mean, Ian and I had already--
everything was resolved, but I
wanted it to get out there
that Ian really betrayed me.
 How did you sleep, Jenn?
 Um, pretty well.
 At Tribal last night, I got a
lot of heat.
My stock in the jury has gone
down, but going into the final
four, I don't think you want
to be necessarily the person
with the highest stock with the
jury because right now, I'm not
the biggest target-- Tom is.
So I feel real good.
Part number three.
 Hmm?
 Part number three.
 Oh, my God! Help us!
 We need help!
 Oh, my God. What is that?
 Oh, my God!
( shrieking )
 It sounded like somebody had
all of a sudden been massacred
in the forest.
We see a cooler with a heavenly
light shining on it--
♪ Ahh ♪ like...
And there's breakfast in it.
 Get out of here.
 Ah, my God!
( whooping )
 It's good to be final four!
 Incoming!
 Whoo!
 We heard you screaming, we
thought a saltwater crocodile
got you.
"So you got some hunger, well go
ahead and feed it.
"A good breakfast gives you
energy, and you're going to need
it.
"Congratulations tribe, you've
made the final four,
36 tough days behind you, get
ready for three more."
 All right!
 Woo!
 There you go.
( smooching )
 It's so exciting.
 Nice.
 Koror claws, everybody.
( all growling )
 There have been no gimmes in
this game-- you fight for what
you get-- so to just get
something today for nothing,
just for making final four, it
was just like an "attaboy."
That's what we call it in the
firehouse.
You know, you get an attaboy.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Eating pineapple is...
It doesn't get better than this!
 I love final four!
 I like food.
 I love final four!
 We were able to eat and laugh
and drink and just enjoy each
other, even though we're just
about to slit each other's
throats because it's going to be
someone's last night here on
Rat Island.
 Tom has dominated.
It's time for him to go.
If Ian or Katie or I win
immunity, he's gone.
 And you're sure about that,
Ian?
 Yeah.
 It's the best bet.
 Yeah, I think it is.
I think it's my best bet.
I mean, right now, I'm at the
point right now where it's like,
like, it's four.
Like, game on, you know what I
mean?
I have a big responsibility
today at this immunity
challenge to beat the crap out
of Tom.
This is the moment that I've
been waiting for the entire
game.
So I win the challenge, Tom goes
home, I don't win the
challenge, Tom's all of a
sudden my best friend again.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys!
 Oh, God.
 You all right?
 PROBST: How you guys doing?
 Fantastic.
 PROBST: Go ahead and take a
look around the Chevrolet SSR.
 Whoo! Very nice!
 Wow.
 PROBST: The winner of today's
challenge does not win this car.
( Survivors laughing )
This car goes to the winner of
Survivor.
The other thing the winner of
Survivor wins is represented in
the glove box.
 What? Oh, my God.
 PROBST: A blank check for $1
million.
 Whoa.
 PROBST: Just a little
reminder of what's at stake over
these last three days.
One of the four of you will have
your name on a check just like
that and you will be a million
dollars richer.
Let's get to today's challenge,
one of the things keeping you
from getting that check.
First things first.
Tom, give it up.
Once again, immunity is back up
for grabs.
All right, for today's immunity
challenge, all four of you will
begin attached to a rope.
On my go, you'll make your way
through a tire crawl-through.
At three different points along
the way, you will stop and
untie a ring of keys.
Once you've collected all three
sets of keys and you've made
your way to the tower,
you'll release yourself from the
rope, you'll use the keys to
unlock a series of padlocks.
Move up to the second level,
where you'll untie a series of
ropes, release a trap door,
move up to the third level.
You'll use a grappling hook,
toss it out to retrieve four
ladder rungs.
Once you have all four ladder
rungs, build your ladder and
make your way to the top level.
The first two to untie their
flag and raise it move on to
the final round.
The two people who move on
to the final round
will race down a flying fox,
retrieve a bag.
In that bag are three numbers
to a combination lock.
Figure out the order, open the
lock, open the box, get another
flag out, and raise it.
First person to raise that flag
wins immunity.
Everybody ready?
 Oh, yeah.
 PROBST: We'll draw for spots
and we'll get started.
For immunity and a guaranteed
spot in the final three.
Survivors ready?
Go!

round, you're gonna race down
the flying fox, retrieve a bag.
Inside that bag is the answer
to a combination lock.
Open the lock, get the flag out
and run it up the flagpole.
For immunity.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Tom and Ian racing back!
Go!
Tom and Ian racing back!
Tom with a bit of a lead.
 Come on, guys!
 PROBST: Tom out of the water
first.
Ian right behind.
There are three numbers in that
bag.
The three numbers, in some
order, are the combination to
your locks.
Ian has his untied.
( Ian whoops )
Tom falling behind.
Ian already starting to work
on the combination.
Tom now has his numbers out.

A little bit of luck involved
here.
Which numbers do you pick?

Ian wrong again.
Tom trying a new set of numbers.
Wrong again.
Ian doesn't have it.
Tom's got a new combination.
Is this gonna be right?
He's got it!
Tom has his lock undone; box is
open.
Tom has his flag undone.
( frustrated grunt )
Tom raises his flag.
Tom wins immunity!
 Nice job, Tom.
 Ah! Good job.
That was a good win.
 PROBST: Tom, get over here.
Couldn't come at a better time.
Turn around.
Tom, the only person safe at
tonight's Tribal Council.
Ian, Katie, Jenn, one of you
is going home tonight.
See you at Tribal.
Head on back to camp.
 That was the biggest
challenge I've ever seen.
 It was huge. It was huge.
 It didn't stop.
It was, like, three hours long.
 I went over and over it again
and again in my head, to send
Tom home if I were to win or
send Jenn home, and as it
turned out, I didn't win.
So it's gonna be Jenn that goes
home tonight.
 You pretty much are
guaranteed a place in the
final...
 I know.
 If he goes tonight.
 The deal with Ian was to play
against everybody together
and then leave it at the end and
fight it toe-to-toe in the final
round, and I'm not there yet,
we're not in the final round,
and I can't turn on him, Jenn.
You know, it's a treacherous
game, and you tell lies, or
whatever you got to do to get
ahead.
I'm just telling Jenn that in
spite of how tempting it is
to cut you loose and let you fly
tonight, ( laughs ): um...
I can't do it, I won't do it,
because of, you know, the bond
that we've made and-and the
promises, and, uh...
 I'd rather have that than...
 I believe so.
 Yeah.
 So things are good with us,
as far as within the game
and outside the game, um...?
 Absolutely.
 Okay. Jenn.
 Absolutely. Thank you.
 It has been a pleasure and an
honor to play this far into
this with you...
 Me, too.
 With everyone and you.
 You know when the other guy
is gonna stand by you, and he
should know that you'll stand by
him.
( sniffles )
I'm taking a risk.
 Oh, little Jenn...
 But that's my move.
 I just felt like such a
loser.
In all the challenges, people'd
be, like, why does she deserve
to even be in the final three...
 You guys are happy, I'm sad--
I think I just made a decision
that might cost me a million
dollars.
 Well, if I would've won
immunity today, it'd have been
a really difficult decision for
me, too, Tom, so I'm glad that I
didn't have to make it, and, um,
you know, I appreciate you
sticking with me.
 I thought that it was an easy
choice, and he told me, "Wow, I
was glad I didn't have to make
it, that would've been a tough
one," and I thought we were
rock solid, and when he said
that, I was, like, well, maybe
he wouldn't have chosen me.
Makes me think.
Makes me think.
When I told Ian that it was a
tough, you know, I said, no, I
said, "You knew it was you,"
and he said, "I'm glad I didn't
have to make it, that's a tough
decision."
 Uh-huh.
 And I'm, like...
 Right. Right.
 I acted like it was no
decision, and, then, now I'm
realizing that he would've been
deciding whether or not to play
it the way we...
 He said he was gonna vote you
out.
He said if you would've lost
today, you would've been gone.
 Who'd he say that to?
 Me.
 Come on.
 Us.
 Oh, oh, I'm sorry, you didn't
know, but that was the deal,
that was the deal.
If you would've lost today, the
three of us were gonna vote you
out.
 Let's talk to him right now.
 Yeah, all right.
 Ian.
 Yes?
 My friend, come talk to me.
 Yes?
 You just floored me-- when I
told you, you know, like, it was
a no-brainer, and you said, "I'm
glad I didn't have to make that
decision, it would've been a
tough one to make for me."
 Right.
 And I'm, like, what am I, I'm
the fool who's doing the right
thing, and to you, it was gonna
be a decision if we came to this
point of the game.
 There's a lot of things that
are said in the game, Tom, and
you know...
 That's a big thing you just
said, that was a big slip.
 That's true, and it's a
decision that I didn't have to
make.
 What did you say to Katie and
I about if Tom lost immunity
today?
 That's right, yeah.
Well, I'm playing the game, just
like everybody else.
 I'm just saying, he just
needs to know.
 Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Absolutely...
 What did you say?
Tell me what you said.
 I-I-I told them
that if I won immunity today
that I was gonna vote you off.
But I, Tom, like...
 Okay, that's all I needed to
know.
 PROBST: We now bring in the
members of our jury.
Coby, Janu, Steph, Gregg,
and Caryn-- voted out at the
last Tribal Council.
Well, here's what I know.
Tribal Council usually starts
right about sundown.
We are way past sundown, which
tells me something was going on
back at camp.
Tom, fill me in.
 It was a tough immunity
challenge today.
There was so much at stake, and
I wasn't even in panic mode,
because I thought, I got a solid
thing-- it's only Ian and I
against each other, and it's
gonna be Jenn tonight because of
her promise from day two.
 PROBST: Meaning, even if you
don't win immunity and Ian does,
he's got your back, you're fine.
 So I thought, and then Ian
said, "Yeah, I'm glad I didn't
win immunity, because I don't
know what I would've done,
that's a tough decision."
And I was, like, am I the fool
being played here that's risking
a million dollars to go
toe-to-toe with this guy just
out of honor, and I might not
have gotten that in return?
I take a walk down the beach
to think about this, and then
Jenn came down and said, "Ian
said today if he won immunity,
Tom's got to go."
I go back to camp, and I said,
"Did you say that?" and Ian
says, "Yeah, I said it, but it
was just game talk."
 PROBST: Ian, you've had this
cloud sort of swirling around
you the last couple of Tribals
that you can't seem to get out
from under.
 Yeah, well, the-the bottom
line for me is-- and I want to
make sure that I say this just
in case I do leave tonight-- Tom
and I went so far as to make
this gentlemen's agreement that
said we would try to take each
other to the final three, so
when this whole thing came up,
Tom came back to me and said,
you know, "What's going on?"
I said, yeah, these are
discussions that've been had.
It doesn't mean that that's what
you're gonna do, that's just the
discussion that you and to make
sure that you can hear what's
going on.
 PROBST: Did at any point you
go to your strongest ally in day
two and say, "Listen, I just
want to give you a heads up,
this is what's being talked
about, I'm playing into it, I'll
keep you informed"?
 Absolutely.
 PROBST: So why is this a
surprise to you, Tom, if Ian
told you all this?
 He didn't tell me that.
And he just actually made a
third strike against himself,
because he said today, he
slipped at the fire and said,
"Wow, that would've been a tough
decision for me."
Then I find out that he did say
something today about, "Tom goes
if I get immunity."
And just now he said we've had a
gentlemen's agreement that
we would try to take each other
to the final three.
And we didn't say that we would
"try."
We said that we will go to the
final three in spite of the
physical threat to each other at
that point, drop the gloves,
fight it out, and move forward.
 Tom and I made an agreement
that said we'd take each other
to the final three-- I'm sorry,
I didn't mean "try"-- we would
take each other to the final
three.
But, like, from my perspective
right now, like, it.. I don't...
I-I'm really flabbergasted,
because I-I'm worried that Tom's
taking my word, which has been
good with him since day two,
against somebody who is in the
11th hour and cornered.
 It's not Jenn's word I'm
listening to, it's your words
I'm listening to.
 I never intended on going
back on Tom, I never intend...
I never intended it, I intended
on taking Tom and Katie
to the final three, or working
with Tom and Katie to get to the
final three.
That was my intention.
 PROBST: What's really
interesting is the looks on
everybody's faces.
Tom looks angry, Katie looks
hurt, and Jenn looks delighted.
( laughter )
 Right, and I may be a little
happy because it stirred up some
things that needed to be out.
It needed to happen, and people
need to hear these things.
 PROBST: Katie, why are you so
pained by this?
 Ian, obviously, is very
concerned about what Tom thinks
right now, but, uh, doesn't seem
to be very concerned about...
what I think.
And I have a vote here, too, you
know?
 The reason that I'm
approaching Tom about the whole
thing is, when we left the beach
today, that was the discussion
that was on the table.
 Right. Tom seems pissed.
He might write your name down.
 Mm-hmm.
 And if he does...
 I go home.
 Not necessarily.
 There's a good chance.
 If it ties up, because if I
vote for Jenn-- but you're not
even considering that.
 No, that's not true.
 I just have one question
for you.
 Okay.
 Have you lied to me in the
last 24 hours?
Straight out.
 Have I lied to you in the
past 24 hours?
No. Straight out.
 PROBST: Everybody have all
the information they need?
The only thing we know is Tom's
not going anywhere because he
has immunity.
Want to give it up?
 You know what?
I'm going to hang onto it.
Things are a little rocky over
here.
 PROBST: Everybody else is
fair game.
It is time to vote.
Jenn, you're up.
I'll go tally the votes.
Jenn, you're up.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final, person voted
out will be asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Ian.
Jenn.
One vote Jenn.
Ian.
Two votes Ian, one vote Jenn.
I'll read the last vote.
Jenn.
We're tied.
Here's what's going to happen:
Jenn, you will not vote again.
Ian, you will not vote again.
Only Katie and Tom will vote.
If neither of you change your
votes, we will be deadlocked
and we'll move to a tiebreaker.
Katie, you're up.
I'll go tally the votes.
Katie, you're up.
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final, person voted
out will be asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote...
Jenn.
One vote Jenn.
I'll read the other vote.
Ian.
We're still tied.
All right, because there are
only four of you, one of you has
immunity, we don't draw rocks.
Tiebreaker works a little
differently.
Jenn and Ian, you will take part
in a tie-breaker challenge
involving fire that will decide
your fate in this game.
Take a spot behind one of the
fire-making urns and I'll
explain.
You each have a box of
fire-making materials.
The challenge is simple: build a
fire with the flame high enough
and hot enough to burn through
the rope.
When you burn through the rope,
you'll raise your flag.
First person to raise their flag
stays in this game, moves on
to the final three.
The other person goes home.
You ready?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: Go.
Jenn has a little something
going.
Ian has a big flame, but a lot
of that is just coconut husks
burning.
The key is to build the flame
high enough and hot enough
to burn through that rope.
Ian got a legitimate fire going
right now.
It's hitting the rope.
Jenn needs to get something
going.
Ian is very close.
He's got fire on the rope,
very close to burning through.
Once that flag raises, this
challenge is over.
And there it is.
Ian stays in this game.
Ian, go ahead and take a spot
next to Katie.
Jenn, you need to bring me your
torch.
Jenn, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
 Good luck, guys.
 PROBST: You three are the
final three.
I'm sure it's going to be an
interesting night at camp
tonight, as well as tomorrow
when you take part in your final
immunity challenge.
I suggest you try and get some
sleep.
You're going to need it-- grab
your torches, head back to camp.
Good night.
 I lasted 37 days, but it
didn't work out my way.
I am a little disappointed in
Katie.
She had a chance to keep me
around a little bit longer,
and she went against that.
So, Katie, I don't know if you
have my vote any longer.
 We came back to camp, and I'm
thinking, "Wow, I just cast a
vote against Ian and tried to
get rid of him."
He's still here.
And then you're saying to
yourself, "I am right, aren't I?
I mean, he did just try to
submarine me."
You know, it's a personal
grudge now.
It's kind of like it's
already out of the bag, so...
 I know, but what do you want
me to tell you?
What do you want to hear from
me?
 Tell me the truth, which is
that you weren't going with me
to the final three to duke it
out like men.
 That is not the truth.
 And now I'm supposed to buy
the fact that just prior to me
winning immunity, you had made
up your mind to do the right
thing?
No, not after I won.
Not after I won the immunity.
 No!
 Come on.
You are like the worst liar.
It's all out now.
It's all going to be said.
 That really sucks, because,
you know what?
Tom's been sticking up for you
this whole time.
"Ian's never wavered."
 I did believe that that he
would never flip on you.
 Gosh, Tom, you're twisting
the truth.
 I'm twisting the truth?
Come on, you gotta be kidding
me.
 We sat there...
 There's all three of us.
There's no more lying now.
Everyone's got different
stories.
 No matter, no matter what I
say, no matter what I say, I'm
the bad guy tonight, and you
know what?
 'Cause you're lying to her
and to me.
 Why don't you just fess up to
it?
 Fess up to what?!
 Say that you...
Yeah, you told me you were
going to take out Tom with Jenn
and I.
 I did, I told him that
already.
We're playing a game!
 Yeah, but...
 We're playing a game.
We're playing a game.
 We thought we were all
playing the game together.
 Yeah, yeah.
 I thought that was the plan,
we take this to the final three,
and I held to it.
I held to it right up to...
I was walking on to that beach
tonight to make my vote, and get
rid of Jenn and fight you
tomorrow.
 And you are crucifying me
for, for a decision that I
didn't even make.
 You didn't get the chance.
You had the immunity necklace?
I'm home taking a shower right
now.
I just wish you'd say that.
I just wish you would just be
able to say, "You're right,
Tom."
 It didn't have to be so ugly.
It just didn't.
 I didn't... Tom...
 What are you trying to
salvage?
The game is what the game's
going to be.
 I'm not trying to salvage,
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you what was going
through my mind and my heart and
my soul.
That's what I'm telling you.
 Oh, it's your soul that's
speaking to us now.
 That's where, that's where it
gets skewed, Ian.
Why don't you just say, "Hey,
I'm playing a game.
"I'm making double deals
everywhere, and I got caught"?
Why can't you just say that?
Why can't you understand that's
what you've been doing?
 That's kind of refreshing.
Actually, you can borrow
that speech.
That was a good one.
I'd love to tell you that it's
time to just step up, be a man
and admit to the whole thing,
but, you know, that will, I
don't know, that will come with
age, I guess, where you just are
willing to fess up.
It's just weasely to still be
saying that, "I wasn't going to
do it, I wasn't going to do it."
You slipped tonight and you blew
it.
 Last night was probably one
of the worst nights of my life.
Like, it shouldn't be like
this.
I basically got laid out.
I mean, just totally laid out.
My game that I've been playing
the entire time was, was put to
the fire, and nobody else
could do any wrong.
There was no other person that
ever told any fib or any lie.
 You didn't have to sleep out
here.
So what are you going to do
today?
 I have no idea.
 Are you going to fight?
 I'm not afraid to.
 Well, I think you should.
 I think I might.
 Especially because then you
should pick me.
 It was my intention in the
first place.
 I'd like to believe that,
but, it's hard, you know?
 Last night was really rough.
 You can say that again.
 It just, it stabs me.
( sobbing ): I didn't come out
here to play the villain.
I didn't come out here to, like,
be this, be the-the backstabber,
especially to those two.
Like, sure, you play the game
for yourself.
Like, you play the game for a
million dollars.
You play the game.
I came out here to win a million
bucks, and I would lie to
anybody if I wasn't telling them
that I wasn't playing the game
for myself, but the bottom line
is, I wanted Katie and Tom in
the final three, and we got
here.
Am I wrong?
Is there something that
I'm really doing wrong here?
Or, you know, am I just playing
the game, just like everybody
else?
Right now, I'm gonna fight.
I'm going to stand up there and
I'm going to take him to the mat
because I'm not afraid.
 Tree mail.
Tree mail, Tom.
 I'm going to go to the final
two.
"15 were outwitted or maybe
just outplayed, but they were
definitely outlasted.
"Now remember the time that they
stayed.
"You'll paddle together
northward to the giant rock,
"with the gate underneath
the archway, 15 torches there
await.
"Take them on your journey and
bear them at sea then on to
your last challenge, the battle
of final three."
 Today is one of the sweet
moments of this game
as you go to your final battle
and acknowledge everybody who
played with you, against you,
sometimes for you, and, uh,
give them a burial at sea.
 Jolanda, fierce competitor.
 She was a hard charger.
 Yeah.
 When people see me, they see
a very strong Black woman.
I mean, I won the first
immunity challenge.
You know, I was a threat.
This game, more than anything,
confirmed for me who I know
myself to be.
I have strength, and I'm going
to embrace it.
 Ashlee.
 Sweet belle of the South.
 Yep.
 This whole experience really
humbles you and teaches you
a lot about yourself.
I can go home knowing that I
pushed myself physically,
mentally, as far as I could go,
and, you know what?
I actually, I was okay.
I survived.
 Who we got?
 We got Jeff.
 I made a big, bonehead
mistake, going out in the middle
of the night, rolled my ankle
on a coconut.
I don't know how much worse you
can go out.
But you know what?
I don't regret a second of it.
I wouldn't change a single
thing.
If this is how I had to go,
this is how I had to go.
At least nobody hates me.
 Kim.
 Kim.
 I think being in this game
has allowed me to finally
embrace who I am and the mental
abilities that I have to see
people for who they are and for
what's really buried deep
inside of them.
 Okay, got Willard.
 Good-bye, Willard.
 I wasn't nearly as grumpy
as I am in my day-to-day life.
'Cause I made a real effort not
to do that.
You know, I didn't win the
money, but I won the game of
life, and that's the important
part.
 Angie.
 I've never really been part
of a team before.
Like, I've never had that
experience where, you know,
you're relying on somebody else
to kind of help get you through
something.
I've always relied on myself
for just about everything.
I wanted to, you know, prove
that I could stick it out
and be as physical as some of
the other people, you know.
So I think they were really...
people were surprised
that I turned out to be as
tough as I was.
 ( southern twang ): We've got
James.
Made me laugh every time he
came to a challenge.
 I'll tell you what, James was
a character.
 He was a character.
 Definitely a character.
It wouldn't have been the
same without him.
 I come into this game
thinking I was gonna conquer
all.
Ooh-doggy!
The most important thing I'm
gonna take home with me is not
take my life for granted
anymore.
 Ibrehem, the strong, silent
one, right?
 Yeah.
 Good guy.
 From being rained on, being
hungry, being tired, then
having to come back and maybe
listen to people bicker a
little bit, I think me being
out here made me a little more
spiritual.
 Bobby Jon.
 Never stopped working.
 Tough competitor; he was
always conducting himself
like a gentleman.
 Did not like to lose.
 You were hot.
 I have no regrets at all.
I totally fulfilled my destiny.
I can honestly say that I left
every inch, every effort, every
blood, sweat that I had in my
body, every toenail out on that
island.
 Coby, Coby, Coby, Coby.
 I played the whole game too
hard, which is why they saw me
as a threat, but I don't care.
This is my experience.
That's what I wanted.
So, no regrets, none.
 Janu.
 My experience in Survivor
was like a roller coaster.
I am glad that I made the
decision to lay down my torch
at Tribal Council.
I messed up the plans of those
that were trying to keep me in
and so I liked that.
 All right, let's move on.
 Steph. I love her.
 Yeah, I do, too.
 A good spirit.
 A really good spirit.
 I never knew how strong I
really was, both mentally and
physically, until I came into
this game.
To just continue to be the last
one standing in my tribe, here
it turns out that I was the
strongest.
 All right, guys.
This is a tough one.
Gregg.
 For me to come away from the
experience and just be more
excited to get back to a life,
friends and family that I love
and have my integrity and be
proud of who I am and who I was
during this game, is just a
very rewarding experience.
 Caryn and I had a lot of ups
and downs, but I actually,
genuinely like her as a person.
 Yeah, me, too.
 I respect her.
 That's right, with respect.
 I always knew that I could do
without material possessions,
but this is a whole other
level.
You're in this game.
It's all-consuming.
It's everything, and then the
torch is snuffed out and you
are in another world.
 This was a really hard one
for me.
 Yeah.
 Jenn was my best girl out
here.
Definitely miss her presence,
sad to see her go.
 Mm-hmm.
 Love you, Jenn.
 To a great competitor and
good person.
 I would definitely say that
I've proved that I am not the
girlie-girl that people thought
I was.
And I think people really ended
up respecting me and my game.
It's been the most amazing
experience I've ever had in my
entire life.
 PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Last time you're gonna paddle
to a challenge.
First things first.
For the last time, immunity is
up for grabs.
For your final immunity
challenge, you're going to bob
on a buoy for as long as you
can.
Here's how it works-- there are
three floating buoys in the
water.
Each buoy has a pole to hold
onto, and a small metal disc
to stand on.
Three rules:
You cannot sit down on the disc.
You cannot touch any part of
the buoy underneath the disc.
And you will do this barefoot.
Last person left standing wins
immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final two and decides
who sits next to them at that
final Tribal Council.
We'll randomly draw for spots
and you'll swim out.
All right, everybody, get up
into your standing position on
the small disc.
The final immunity challenge has
begun.
 Whoa.
 PROBST: Ian, you think this
is going to go a while?
 I think so.
 PROBST: How 'bout you,
Katie?
 Oh, yeah.
 PROBST: Tom?
 A couple hours.
 PROBST: I'm guessing nobody
is going to willingly
step down off of this challenge.
 Oh, no.
 PROBST: Nobody trusts anybody
anymore in this group.
 ( chuckling ) No way.
 Are you kidding me?
 PROBST: You've been out here
one hour.
What are you thinking about,
Katie?
 Winning immunity.
It'd be a nice one to win.
 PROBST: How about you, Ian?
 It was a pretty rough night
for me last night.
So, I'm thinking about a lot of
stuff.
 Whoa!
 It's really windy right now.
 Wow.
 It really is windy, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 I'm getting really far over.
 PROBST: The wind is
definitely picking up.
( thunder )
 Wow.
 PROBST: Here comes the rain.
Tom, is this rain going to make
this any more difficult?
 Not as difficult as the sun
would be.
 PROBST: How confident are you
right now that you can win this,
Katie?
 Pretty confident if someone
makes a mistake.
 PROBST: Ian, how confident
are you that you can win this
challenge?
 Pretty confident.
But you never know what's going
to happen.
 PROBST: Think you can beat
Tom?
 Yup.
 This hurts.
I'm not enjoying myself right
now.
 PROBST: What's hurting?
 My back.
 PROBST: Coming up on five
 My back.
 PROBST: Coming up on five
hours.
Katie trying to find a
comfortable spot.
 I'm in a bad way.
Good luck, you guys.
 PROBST: Katie has just
stepped down, taking herself out
of the challenge and might have
just cost herself a shot at a
million bucks.
Tom and Ian, last two left
standing, last immunity
challenge with everything you
two have been through.
What's hurting right now, Tom?
 Everything is numb from the
knees down.
 PROBST: How about you, Ian?
 Feel pretty good.
 PROBST: I'm amazed that we
 Feel pretty good.
 PROBST: I'm amazed that we
have been out here eight hours.
 Whoo-hoo!
 PROBST: There hasn't been one
word spoken in the last four and
a half and never once has even
the notion of a deal come up.
 What, have you got pizza?
 I'm gonna say, are there
French fries or something?
 Um, if I beat you at this
event I'm taking Katie to the
final.
If you step off that perch, I'm
taking you.
 Okay, I won't step off the
perch.
 I think you should take the
offer.
 You're that afraid of going
to Tribal against me right now,
all your persuasive language
skills...
 Tell you what, you jump
first, we have a deal.
 ( chuckles )
 Okay, I'll count to three.
 Yeah, right.
 Come on, Ian.
Final two.
Just step down, and pay a few
college loans-- $100,000.
That's not chump change.
 I thought you wanted to duke
it out, Tom.
That's why I can't step down.
And won't step down.
 As you know, I've had a,
uh... interesting day.
Um, I'll, uh, I'll go down, you
take Katie.
And I'll give up the million,
um, to get back your-your guys'
friendship.
 PROBST: Wait.
You will step down...
 Yes. I will step down.
 PROBST: He doesn't take you
but, instead, takes Katie as a
way to show that you do care
about these guys.
 To show that, yeah.
 You would do that?
 Yeah. I would do it.
 PROBST: Just to be clear, Tom
has been offering to take you
and give you a shot.
 Right.
 PROBST: That doesn't sound as
good as taking back your
integrity and giving up any
chance.
 That's right.
 PROBST: And giving somebody
who's been out of this challenge
now for ten hours.
 Yes, I've, I've thought about
it for the past 24 hours, how to
reconcile my differences.
My hole gets deeper and deeper.
I, I can't leave this game with
that on my shoulder,
so I will dive right now if you
take Katie.
I said all along the friendship
was more important, I feel like
the longer we sit up here, the
more and more I feel like a
traitor to that, and a traitor
to myself, so, yeah, I'll do it.
 PROBST: Tom, would it be
successful?
Would he be accomplishing what
he's trying to do?
 Without a doubt.
Ian would have my friendship
after this game anyway, but he
wins my respect back.
 PROBST: Ian steps down.
wins my respect back.
 PROBST: Ian steps down.
Tom wins final immunity.
Nobody would have predicted this
Tom wins final immunity.
Nobody would have predicted this
move.
 I was about to fall off, too.
I'm surprised you did that.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: Put this on.
Let me ask you guys something.
Tom, you have immunity.
Is there any reason we shouldn't
hold Tribal Council right now?
 I'm going to ask Ian one more
time because I think we're both
a little punchy and delirious.
Are you taking yourself out,
and-and do you want me to hold
to that?
 We made a deal.
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
You guys need to go
to the final two.
 PROBST: All right, here's
what's going to happen.
The only person who votes is
you.
Give me a verbal vote.
Who are you voting out of this
game tonight?
 Uh, I'm going to vote out my
buddy Ian.
And as bad as I felt last
night, I feel ten times better.
Um, he's just a hell of a guy,
and I respect him.
 PROBST: Ian, you are the 16th
person voted out of this game.
You'll become the seventh
member of the jury, with,
potentially, a very big vote.
So, Tom, Katie, you two are the
final two.
You have one more night here in
Palau.
Tomorrow night, we will hold our
final Tribal Council.
You two will get in your
outrigger, head back to the
beach.
Ian, you'll stay here with me.
I'll get you to the jury.
Good night.
 All right, I'm going to tell
Good night.
 All right, I'm going to tell
you a dream I had.
You tell me your dream.
Let's find out if it really
happened.
I don't see anybody else here in
camp, and I had a dream that you
and I are the final two.
Is it possible?
 It's possible.
It's day 39.
 Day 39.
 Oh, my gosh.
Can you believe it?
 The time is almost here.
 Yes.
 One more day here.
 Whoo!
That was the last night, Tom!
 That was it.
 I woke up this morning and I
was, like, "Oh, my God!
This is it, this is our last
day.
"Wait, it's just Tom and I.
Wait, I made it to the final
two."
 Katie, that's a good
testament to you.
It's been 39 days, but I know
I'll miss you tomorrow,
when we're not doing this again,
so....
 Yeah.
 Katie is so likable, and
she's such a character, that,
you know, you just don't know
if people just say, you know
what?
I've had enough of Tom and his
immunity necklace.
I'm going to give it to the one
who was able to make it there
just by riding with Tom.
To be here today as one of the
final two is almost
disconnecting.
I'm, you know, really having
trouble, um... processing it.
It's like I'm kind of numb to
the whole thing right now.
Final Tribal Council is
tonight.
We won't be back to this beach.
This is our last day here.
And, uh, you know, it's
bittersweet.
It's-it's...
it's been tough here, but it's
been the experience of a
lifetime and, uh...
I think we're going to take this
place apart with a little lump
in our throat.
 Right, whoever wins gets
that, right?
 Is that right?
 Yeah.
 Okay, good enough.
Ready? One, two, three.
We're going to get a good
bonfire going, and it'll be
a celebratory bonfire, and the
picnic table won't be used
by any other tribe, or family
gathering.
That's... it fed this
tribe, this family, and, uh...
it's a great day to be here.
( both whooping )
 Careful.
I'm telling the fireman to be
careful around the fire.
 That's good advice.
 I played this game in a
different way than Tom, but
just as hard.
There's this scary beast in
there-- inside Tom.
He's threatening, he's
intimidating.
I, once again, will be candid,
and let the jury know, you know,
what Tom has been up to, and
what kind of steps that he took
to keep himself in the game.
( whistling )
Good-bye, coconuts, cemetery.
 Good-bye, coconut, is right.
 Bye, rats.
 We're done with that.
That's it, the rats get it
back now.
 I'm really proud of myself
for getting through this, and I
hope people can appreciate the
game for what it is.
I hope I get some credit for
the way that I played this
game, and the choices that I've
made.
 The jury tonight-- no
treachery or half-truths or
sugarcoating things.
Whatever I did got me to where
I am right now and, uh, so be
it.
Now it's in their hands, not
mine.
 PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of your jury--
Coby, Janu, Steph, Gregg, Caryn
and Jenn.
We'll now bring in the last
member of our jury-- Ian-- voted
out at an impromptu Tribal
Council last night.
All right, we have a lot to get
to tonight, so let's get
started.
39 days you slugged it out in
this game, and now all the power
shifts to seven people that you
had a hand, either directly or
indirectly, in voting out of
this game.
They now hold your fate in their
hands.
Tonight, they will question you.
They will hold you accountable
for your actions out here.
And, based on what you tell
them, they will vote.
Here's how it's going to work.
Tom and Katie, you will get a
chance to make an opening
statement.
This is your chance to pitch
them on why you deserve the
title of Sole Survivor and $1
million.
After you've made your comments,
they'll get their first chance
to address you since being voted
out.
Once they've had their say,
you'll get a chance for a
closing comment, and then we
will vote-- sound good?
Let's get started.
Tom, you're up first.
 Okay.
Um, it's an honor to be sitting
in front of what has been our
tribe, and our family
for the last couple of weeks,
and I don't sit here pretending
that I deserve this seat any
more than you, there's a million
things I do want to say,
and you can ask me things,
and we'll get to specifics,
but judge me on who I was,
the fact that I came out, I
played real hard, tried to
provide, went out, did my work,
and never had a nasty word
for any of you, and tried to
keep it light.
It's been an honor, and this is
humbling, and I cherish you
people for going through this
experience with me.
 PROBST: Katie.
 Okay.
Um, what I would like to say is
that there's two very different
people sitting here.
Um, I'm not going to pretend
that I am even close to Tom in
some aspects.
The whole goal of this game is
self-preservation, and that's
what I've, that's what I've
done.
I never sat here and had
immunity around my neck,
but I'm sitting here right now.
I'm sure a lot of you are
probably thinking, "Yeah, she
skated by."
"She aligned with two really
strong people."
Well, that's the game.
That's exactly what I did, and I
came in with a plan, and, um, I
executed that plan, and I hope I
really didn't hurt anyone and
everyone can understand that and
respect that, that I played the
only cards I can play.
By far if I can say anything, I
definitely outwitted, and I'm
just honored to be sitting here
right now.
 PROBST: Thanks, Katie.
All right, jury, in a moment,
you're going to get your first
chance to address Tom and Katie.
I'll give you a minute to think
about what you want to say
or what you want to ask.
 PROBST: All right, Tom,
or what you want to ask.
 PROBST: All right, Tom,
Katie, you've made your opening
statements, it's now time for
the jury to address you.
Coby, you're up first.
( Coby exhales )
 Hi, you guys...
 Hi, Coby.
 Hi, Coby.
 So this is going to be
serious.
I have issues, I'm bringing
them.
 Bring them on.
 Bring it on, Coby.
 I respect the fact that I was
outplayed by the two of you, but
that doesn't mean that I have to
respect the way either of you
played the game. So, Katie...
Ooh, you're making this hard
with that little grin, but the
fact of the matter is, is that
if you get my vote tonight-- and
I need to make this clear-- it's
not for how you played the game,
because in the challenges, you
sat out of most of them.
At camp, I rarely saw you muster
enough energy but to stir
coconut.
Your self-proclaimed social
skills really don't lie anywhere
outside of your alliance.
The only quality that I actually
saw you bring to this game was
maybe the value of riding the
coattails of people who do play
the game.
So realize, if I vote for you
tonight, it is not for you, but
it is against Tom.
Which brings me to Tom.
My main problem with how you
played this game, Tom, is that
you played this game almost as
dirty as I would have liked to,
and you played this game every
bit as dirty as Ian did, whether
you want to admit it or not.
And I've seen you come into
every Tribal Council, you dance
around some of your lies, and
you skirt around your issues,
and you're very good at it, I'll
give you that, but I'm not
buying it.
So tonight is your chance, if
you want my vote, to finally
bring out that badge of courage
that you wave of honesty and
truth, and I want to hear it.
So I am now going to sit down,
and I'm going to listen to every
word you say, and you know that
with every word it could cost
you a million dollars.
 PROBST: Gregg.
 Uh, my first comment and
question is for Tom.
When Koror was a tribe of seven,
you didn't have immunity.
You were at risk, and you were
pretty nervous about it.
You and I had a conversation,
once or twice actually, about
how anyone that would break the
five-person alliance would have
to pay for it when it came to
the jury.
Well, here I am today, I'm part
of the jury, and, you know, I
kept my word.
I saved you, and you didn't do
the same.
You didn't pay the same respect.
So why, why on Earth should I
give you my vote?
 Gregg, when I voted you out,
I did think that you had
threatened me; I believed it.
I apologize for that.
I was taken in because I didn't
think I had any reason to doubt
Ian, but when he came and said,
"You're the next to go because
you're winning too many things,"
I believed him, and I apologize
to you for that.
 Regrets?
 Totally. I was taken in.
Let me tell you, I can't believe
that I had the number played on
me that I did.
Um, total regrets.
 Katie, you were...
worthless around camp.
You were insignificant, even
embarrassing on challenges.
You would think that the least
that you could do was, you know,
make some friends around camp.
Yet I still can count a number
of instances where you've
ridiculed, made fun of almost
all these jury members, and even
betrayed them at times.
So my question to you is,
explain to me and the jury how
being so pathetic is your
"plan"-- and not your plan to
get an invite to number two--
but a plan to win you a million
dollars.
 Wow, Gregg. Um...
I don't even know where to begin
with that.
I'm-I'm really sorry that you
feel like I'm pathetic, um, and
I'm sorry you had to go there,
because I would never say
anything like that about you,
um, because you're not, and
I'm-- I don't think I am either,
you know.
I played with the cards that I
have.
I don't have an athletic card.
I'm sorry if you feel like I was
pathetic, but that's not all
this game is about.
It's about getting here, and
going in with a strategy, and I
have never wavered on that
strategy, ever.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Gregg.
Steph.
 Well, congratulations to both
of you for making it this far.
Tom, I get to Koror on Day 22,
and you take me aside, you tell
me, um, I'm not a dead man
walking...
and that you'll do whatever you
can to take me as far as you can
because you know that I deserve
it, and that you'll fight for
me.
And, unfortunately, I don't
think you fought at all or hard
enough because I'm not the one
sitting next to you.
So what I kind of want to know
is, you know...
when my name was brought up
at camp, what did you do to
fight for me, and I don't want
to hear it was strategy or it
was a numbers game.
I want to hear specific things.
 Um, I went as far as I could,
and then it came to the
five-person alliance.
I couldn't step forward and just
say, "No, no, no, Stephenie,
it's got to be Stephenie."
So to preserve the alliance that
I was in, I had to acquiesce,
and I did say, "Okay, it's
Stephenie."
For me to lose my alliance and
still not save you from, uh,
from getting voted off just
didn't make any sense within
this game.
 Okay.
And, Katie, what I want to
know from you is why should I
not vote for Tom?
 I really was hoping that this
wouldn't be as ugly as it was.
I guess it has to get that way.
Tom actually came to me before
you came and said we need to
take out Stephenie.
You pulled me aside and you
said, "Whether it's Stephenie
or Bobby Jon, we gotta take 'em
out, and we need to take 'em
out first."
 Why would I tell a person,
who maybe had an alliance with
the four of us-- Ian, myself,
Katie-- that we had to get rid
of you?
You were an ace in the hole that
was the last person I wanted to
see voted off.
There's no sense to that at all.
 I swear I remember that
conversation.
 PROBST: Satisfied?
 Perfect.
 PROBST: Thanks.
 Thanks, guys.
 PROBST: Janu.
 Well, okay.
Tom, I'll address you first.
Now, you being the man that you
are, tell me how hard was it
to compromise your integrity
to be in this game and to get as
far as you did, and how do you
reconcile that?
 This game is what it is,
and we all know the rules, and
there are lines that we each
have to individually draw and
choose whether or not we cross
over them.
I didn't get to any of those
lines and cross them and-and
have that problem.
I played the game as well as I
can.
I played it with as much honor
as I can.
I mean, you cannot play
Survivor and not mislead,
misdirect.
I went out of my way to never
hurt people,
but the real goal was to get
myself into this seat and to be
judged by how I played the game,
and I welcome that chance now.
 PROBST: As the rain comes
down, Janu, address Katie.
 I will now go to Katie.
My question to you, Katie, is if
you could please give me
three positive and negative
adjectives that best describe
you and how you played this
game.
 Actually...
I don't expect your vote, Janu.
So I don't know that I need to
do that, to give you positive
and negative.
I mean, I can I do that if you
need me to, but I don't expect
your vote.
 You're assuming that you
don't have my vote.
 Right.
 You don't know this, but if
you're willing to sit back and
not answer my question, then so
be it, and I'll return to the
jury.
Fair enough then.
Okay, thank you, both.
 PROBST: Thanks, Janu.
 Caryn.
 Tom, my question to you is
simple: What was I to you in the
game, Tom?
Was I just a pawn?
Did we have a legitimate, real,
genuine friendship?
 I didn't tell you you were in
an alliance.
I never lied to you and said,
"Caryn, you're in."
I told you, "We're the parents
of this dysfunctional family.
"You know, we should look out
for each other's backs."
I did it for you, and now I
found out you did it for me.
I thought that you were lying
to me.
I didn't believe you.
I thought it was game-play.
I thought that you were stirring
up a hornet's nest,
saying that people said things.
It nearly cost me the game.
If I didn't win those two
back-to-back immunities, I was
going home.
 So was I a pawn, or did we
have a real friendship?
 If you were a pawn...
 Within the confines of this
game...
 You know what?
 Was it legitimate and
genuine-- what we were saying
to each other or was I a pawn?
 I'll tell you what.
I won't even answer that
question.
I'm going to let you find that
for yourself in your heart,
okay?
 Okay. Fair enough.
Katie, I'm going to tell you
the things I did observe, okay?
You were phony and cruel to
everyone except Tom and Ian.
Aside from that, I also
observed: laziest person at
camp, mean, bad at challenges,
unkind and betrayed me.
Give me one reason I should vote
for you.
 Um, well, Caryn, I'm sorry if
you think I'm unkind.
I'm not unkind, but, you know,
whatever you want to think
about me personally, um, is your
own prerogative.
If you don't vote for me, Caryn,
it's not going to change how you
feel about me as a person.
Obviously, that is ruling how
you're making your judgments on
me.
 No, the question was, Katie,
these are the things I observed.
 I understand.
 Okay, tell me if there's
something, other than making an
alliance with two strong people
who carried you that I'm
missing.
 That the game is about making
alliances, and that's why you're
sitting over there, because you
didn't make one.
 I got it, Katie, thanks.
 PROBST: Jenn.
 Congratulations, you guys.
Um... Okay...
Tom, my take on you is
that you are, uh, in my mind,
a little chauvinistic.
I believe that you didn't
respect me or my game.
Um, I am a woman with a vote,
and I would like to know why I
should give you the respect of
my vote when I don't believe
that you respected me or my
game.
 Sure, um, my respect for your
game, I'll agree, came late.
When you came up and told me,
ask him right now in front of
me, were you going to vote Tom
out the last two days, confront
Ian right now, and I did, then I
said, "Hey, you're really
playing hard and I do respect
it."
So your whole game was that you
hid your game.
I had no game to see.
 Okay, Katie, to me, what's,
what's worse than being
disrespected is being someone
who just gets disrespected over
and over and just takes it and
lies down.
You know, I think you had
opportunity after opportunity
to play this game like a strong
woman, and I just want to know,
am I wrong?
I mean, did you play it like a
strong woman, like, or a
doormat?
 Um, by preserving myself and
my alliance, I believe that
makes me a strong person, by
realizing how-how to play
this game, how to get where you
get to.
I mean, you make sacrifices.
I'm not here to, um, prove that
I'm a strong woman.
I-I believe that I'm a strong
woman.
Um, by me sticking to my plan,
um, and my-my strategy, yeah, I
feel, I feel good about my game.
 Okay. Okay. Thank you.
 PROBST: Thanks, Jenn.
Ian.
 Yeah.
Uh, answer as honestly as you
can.
It's gonna be the same question
for both of you.
Um, what's the biggest reason
that we, as a group, shouldn't
give you a million dollars?
Katie can go first.
 Um, the biggest reason would
be because you felt that because
of my personality, because of my
sense of humor,
which I thought a lot of people
got a kick out of, if that's
what you're judging outwit,
outplay, and outlast on, don't
vote for me.
 Go ahead, Tom.
 Uh, you shouldn't give me
a million dollars, I think,
because I've already had my
payday, I, uh...
The experience of being here,
with you guys has been genuine.
Uh, being out here, you know,
being a 40-year-old man with
responsibilities at home and
putting it all aside and having
a little boy's adventure, where
your biggest, uh, choice of the
day is do I get out of the
hammock and go chase snakes or
sharks is kind of unique.
And it's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing, and, uh, I've been
compensated.
 Okay.
 PROBST: Thanks, Ian.
 Yep.
 PROBST: All right, Tom and
Katie, you've heard from a very
vocal jury.
I'm going to give you a minute
to think about your closing
statements.
 PROBST: All right, Tom and
statements.
 PROBST: All right, Tom and
Katie, you've heard from the
jury.
Based on what you heard, you now
have one last opportunity to
address them with a closing
statement.
Tom, you can begin.
 Um, when I found out I was
coming out here, and you turn
into a panic, and you start
saying, "Well, how am I going to
play it?
"What's my best personality?
How am I going to act?"
'Cause this is a truth serum,
you don't hide who you are.
Good or bad, uh, you met Tom
Westman, and I stuck with the
people who I said I'd stick with
in the beginning, um, even at
folly, and because of that, I
did hurt some other people along
the way, and I apologize for
that.
Somehow I ended up here, and,
um, I'm glad I did, and I'm
willing to be judged on how I
played the game, how I treated
you; and however you vote,
there are no hard feelings
from this end, and I have loved
these days, and I think we all
have.
Thank you.
 PROBST: Katie.
 Uh...
I'm sorry if I hurt anyone.
I want to start off by saying
that.
Um, I knew coming into this, Tom
was my biggest threat because
he's such a stand-up guy.
He's totally athletic.
He's been true.
That's why I aligned with him.
That's why I aligned with Ian.
My plea to you guys is give me
a chance, you know?
Like, I knew I had nothing going
up against this guy, but I came
into this, and I played with
everything I had.
And it might not be things that
you respect.
You know, you might not respect
my sense of humor, but it got me
here.
All I can say is that I came
into this with a plan, I did it.
I'm leaving with my
self-respect;
I might not be leaving with
yours.
 PROBST: Thanks, Katie.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, now we get to the vote.
Tonight the vote is a little
different.
Tonight you are voting for
somebody.
You are voting for the person
you think most deserving the
title of Sole Survivor and the
million dollars that goes along
with it.
Tom and Katie, this is the one
time you want to see your name
on the parchment.
For the last time, it is time to
vote.
Steph, you're up.
 ( quietly ): Tom, I'm voting
Steph, you're up.
 ( quietly ): Tom, I'm voting
for you because I walked away
with an incredible experience,
and that was due to the fact
that you chose me on that day
when we chose tribes.
So thank you, and good luck to
you.
 ( quietly ): I asked for
you.
 ( quietly ): I asked for
honesty tonight, and I got it...
But it wasn't from you, Tom.
 PROBST: Jury, thanks.
Tom, Katie, I know it's been a
long night.
There's only one thing left to
do.
I'll go get the votes.
As much as I know you'd like me
to read these tonight
and get this over with, you know
it's not going to happen.
I'm going to take the votes back
with me to the U.S.
We'll read them there.
Good night.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Let's get to it!
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Let's get to it!
( cheering and applause
continuing )
Let's do it.
( whistling and cheering )
All right!
Take a seat!
Enthusiastic.
Been a great season.
Kudos to you guys.
Big night.
Obviously, a lot at stake.
Let's get to it, here's what
you're playing for.
For the winner: 2005 Chevy
SSR...
title of Sole Survivor, and a
check in your name for a million
bucks.
That's your jury.
These are the guys that you
played this game with the
longest.
They know you.
They hold your fate in their
hands.
They've made their decision;
it's right here.
Tonight, you do want to see your
name.
These are votes for a winner.
There are seven votes in here;
it takes four to win.
I'll read the votes.
 Go, Tom!
 Go, Tommy!
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause
continuing )
 PROBST: Here we go, guys.
First vote...
Tom.
( cheering and applause )
Katie.
( cheering and applause )
One vote Tom, one vote Katie.
Tom.
Two votes Tom, one vote Katie.
( cheering and applause )
( cheering and applause )
Tom.
That's three votes Tom, one vote
Katie.
The winner of Survivor: Palau.
( cheering and applause )
 Tommy!
Tommy!
Tommy!
