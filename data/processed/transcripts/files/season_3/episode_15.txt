Tonight, all 16
competitors are out of Africa
and live with us in Los Angeles.
The first time they've
all been together
since their days in Kenya.
We have an audience of
fans, friends, and family
this evening.
Particularly joyful, the family
of Ethan, our ultimate survivor
and million dollar winner.
Congratulations.
Thanks.








Congratulations.
[cheering]
[laughs]
The floor is yours.
Do you want to give a
big shout out to Diane
and mom and your brothers and--
Hi, guys.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
They're real happy.
They're really happy.
They're flying
home first class.
I'm the favorite son.
[laughter]








What do you think
the difference was?
Oh, man.
I don't know.
You know, everyone-- even
though I'm up here the winner,
you know, I couldn't have gotten
here without everyone else.
And the difference-- a little
bit of luck involved and making
lasting alliances and
sticking to your alliances
and sticking to your gut and--
not your gut, sorry.
[laughter]
Bad word you're--
Yeah, exactly.
But just having faith
in others when--
there were so many times
when things could've
gone in different directions.
And we stayed true.
And I think that's
what got me to the end.
Let me come back
to you in a moment.
But just in case some
reminders are needed, let
me do a few re-introductions--
with us tonight,
in the order they
left Africa are postal worker
Dianne Ogden, deputy Sheriff
Jessie Camacho, dentist Carl
Bilancione, and the Harvard
based hugger, Linda Spencer.
[laughter]
Bartender Silas
Gaither was the first one
booted out after the
surprising tribal switch.
Then came Lindsey Richter.
You haven't seen all
of her until you've
seen her audition tape, which
you will see a bit later.
Don't look at me, you made it.
Lindsey was followed by the
bean lover, Clarence Black.
Then the members of the jury.
First juror, first
whatever, Kelly Goldsmith.
The ever flamboyant
Brandon Quentin.
His movie date, Frank Garrison.
[laughter]
Then little Kim, Kim Powers.
And the T Bird, Theresa Cooper.
And of course, our final four.
The goat farmer known as
Big Tom, Tom Buchanan.
Grandmaster Lex van den Berghe,
Big Kim, Kim Johnson, and
Ethan Zorn, now a millionaire.
So what do you think
the difference was?
That you had the most respect,
that you did as mom said,
that you can play with
integrity and come home and not
be ashamed of what you'd done?
I think that had
a lot to do with it.
But you know, I think a lot
of people played that way.
And I think it's a very
important part of the game.
You know, you don't have
to be evil and backstabbing
and a villain to do
well in this game.
You can be yourself,
you can play yourself,
you can play fair, you
can try as hard as you
can and just hope for the best.
Kim, why did you
decide to do a one on one
with Ethan rather than Lex?
As I said, it probably
was the hardest decision
that I've ever had to
make because I really,
really respected and
cared about them both.
I mean, when you're out there as
many hours as we were together,
you get to know
people pretty well.
And I guess what it
finally came down
to was I don't really
think that I could have
won against either one of them.
And so I had to make a decision.
I felt that Lex had won so
many things already, and not--
I mean, obviously not the
million, sorry darling.
But I guess what it
finally came down to is
if I couldn't win it, who did I
next feel deserved it the most.
And you didn't think you
could prevail against Lex?
No, I did not.
You know why?
Because honestly, and
I know what we've seen,
but Lex was very well
liked among all of us.
A lot of the comments that
he made that seemed negative
were not made to us.
They were made without
our being able to hear it.
And so I think that--
Kelly may disagree
with you a little bit.
But Kelly's one vote.
I mean, I really--
I could name four people right
now that I know would have
voted for Lex instead of me.
So I think-- and maybe
instead of a five two,
it might have been four three.
You know, I don't know.
But I didn't feel
any more confident.
Lex, you said at the end, I've
worked so hard to get this far.
In retrospect, was your undoing
being out front too much?
You know, I didn't know any
other way to play the game.
I mean, all of us went out
there, we're all competitors.
When you're put in
this competition,
sure, you can think, well,
maybe I should pull back
or I should hold back here.
But out there, the
only thing I knew
was how to just push
as hard as I could,
try to kick ass as much
as I could, and to win.
I mean, that was-- whether it
might have been strategically
not the best move,
the only thing
I could think about there, to
do-- the only thing I could do
was to go out there to win,
and to win as much as possible,
and to win everything.
Mm hmm.
Thomas, it's satisfying to have
come so close or frustrating
for the same reason?
Well, it's frustrating.
I'd rather won.
I'd rather be over at
that million dollars.
He's going back first
class and I'm gonna walk.
[laughter]
Was there a moment
when you thought,
after you made the final four,
that hey, I can win this thing?
Did you think you could?
I sure did.
Honestly, a mental challenge
wasn't what I was hoping for.
[laughter]
You know, I'm a goat farmer,
not a rocket scientist.
But you know, honestly,
I felt real good
and we had a strong alliance.
It proved our way through,
with Ethan, Lex, and me.
And I felt real confident and--
but the chips fell where they
may, and I can live with it.
Let me go to the jurors.
Did you all have your minds
made up before the speeches?
Well, not you, Brandon.
Obviously.
- I did.
I actually did.
I was totally going
to vote for Ethan.
There was no
question in my mind.
And just because he dissed
you on your own question?
Yeah, I just wanted to
poke a little bit at Frank
and tell him I was mad that
he beat me up at three days.
And then, you know, Ethan's
like, you don't deserve it.
I was like, how can
I vote for that?
[laughter]
And Kelly, the number--
help me out, come on.
And you know, to be
honest, Ethan's right.
I didn't want to put
in the mental effort.
I didn't think they deserved it.
They voted my butt out
and I said, you take this.
Pick a number.
And that's how
you came up with it.
Yeah, I just
knew that it would
make them squirm a little bit.
- Yeah?
Mm hmm.
Frank, Kim, T Bird,
what did you want
to hear him say at the end?
Or was your mind pretty made up?
I think for me, my mind
had been made up a long--
prior-- you know, earlier weeks.
And I was going to talk to Ethan
and I said, Ethan, if it can't
be me, then you're my man.
So-- didn't I tell
you that early on?
You did.
So I knew way ahead.
Yeah.
Kim, you said it was
a hard vote for you.
Right?
Real hard.
Ultimately, what swung it?
To Kim J?
Well, I love Kim J's answer.
I don't know.
[laughter]
It was really sweet.
You know, it was a very hard
decision, but Kim impressed me.
She is 56 years old
and she was out there,
just kicking some serious butt.
And I'm 30.
And it was really hard on me.
And to see her as a female,
she is a role model.
She's a role model.
And Frank, for you, what
was the determining factor?
Why Ethan?
Why not Kim?
My mind was made up.
I mean, Ethan all the way, as
a soccer player, his interest
in working with
children, helping
them come up through there,
I just made up my mind.
Yeah?
It was just a common
denominator there,
and was a quick little--
Silas, I remember saying,
early on in this game,
that the game was
90% luck, 10% skill.
Having prevailed, what
equation would you give it?
Not 90% luck.
I don't think that.
I think there is a
lot of luck involved.
The whole switcheroo thing.
That was unlucky for
some people, like Silas.
Like Silas.
He was a fish out of water
once he came over to us,
and that could've
been any one of us.
Yeah.
And it was just
unlucky for him.
And in that sense, luck is
a huge part of the game.
Did the best player win?
I think so.
Kim?
Did the best player win?
- I think so.
- Lex?
Absolutely.
I do.
Tom?
I thought I was
the best, but--
[laughter]
[inaudible]
If I can't win, I--
Yeah.
OK.
Well, but-- really, I had an
alliance with Lex and Ethan--
Yeah.
And if it wasn't me,
I wanted it to be--
Well, let me settle something.
When we come back, we'll
talk about alliances.
And we'll talk friends
and enemies made
in the heat of competition.
Stay with us.
Our "Survivor: Africa"
Reunion continues,
live from Los Angeles,
right after this.
[applause]
Oh, come on, we're going
to [inaudible] Woo hoo!
Come on, doggies, here we go!
Let's hit the big show, boys!
We're going to be a star!
That's what I are.
Come on!
[applause]
Go ahead.
The floor is yours.
Well, I thought I was going
to be a star, what I are.
Said I are or I ain't.
[laughter]
Well, you are.
- It's a lot of fun.
- Yeah?
A lot of fun.
I met 15 different great
friends and I don't
know what else I could ask for.
Well, you know, we kind of
slugged this section Friends
and Enemies, and I know
there are no enemies here.
But you made an
interesting comment, Ethan,
when you said, out there, you're
always surrounded by people,
but you felt so alone.
I did.
Was that because you
couldn't trust anybody?
Well, there's always--
no matter how tight our
alliance was and no matter
how good friends you
are with everyone,
there's always that little
bit in the back of your mind
where these people
could be playing me,
they could turn on
me in any minute,
so you can never fully--
I never felt I could
fully trust anyone.
Yeah.
Because ultimately,
everyone wants to win.
You know, the last
one standing, Diane,
you were the first one off.
That embarrassing?
Oh, yeah and no.
I mean, I was kind of
relieved to go first.
Being sick, it was
too hard for me.
And it didn't really bother me.
If you hadn't taken
the map, you think
you would've lasted longer?
Yeah.
Hmm, I think it was the
water that got dumped.
Yeah.
Well, you were the
first one to faint.
Jessie, you were
the first one to--
Throw up.
Yeah.
To lose your breakfast.
Why?
Because you were unprepared?
Oh, you know what?
I'm not really sure.
I started drinking the
water from the gourd
as soon as we got on
the bus, and my stomach
was just not taking it right.
Yeah?
But yeah, I puked.
Oh well.
That's life.
What were you
going to say, Silas?
In Diane's defense, I
mean, y'all, she was picked
out of like 50,000 people.
So I wouldn't say that
was disappointing at all.
I'm very proud of
Diane for being here.
Very nice.
No doubt.
Honey.
Aww!
[applause]
OK.
All right.
But Diane's plight brings us
to the first cringe moment of
the series, which was the bean.
OK?
Tom, if I had a
gun, I'd shoot you?
Did I steal your [inaudible]?
Isn't that a
little over the top?
Oh--
Hell yeah.
[laughter]
[interposing voices]
Thank God that
wasn't my luxury item.
[interposing voices]
I wasn't talk--
I'd say not.
Men-- you know, that
was just a comment.
If he didn't shoot him, I
would have cut his throat.
[laughter]
[interposing voices]
Yeah, maybe.
Clarence, why did
you take it so well?
I mean, I'll be honest with you.
There are a lot of folks
sitting at home going, yo,
I would not take that.
Man, that was crazy.
You know?
Because I'm just
thinking, man, I'm hungry.
I lost all ability to think
rationally after that.
I could see--
[interposing voices]
All I could see was my--
[interposing voices]
No, I was just a
victim of hunger.
I was just starving.
So you know, I ate it.
And it wasn't until
I was sitting there
and these people
was yelling at me,
and honestly, the
reason I didn't go off
was because I was
thinking about food.
Like I just ate some beans
and I wanted more, man.
But I couldn't believe
everybody was that mad.
Like, I ain't see
white people that
mad since OJ got acquitted.
[laughter]
Honestly, if I
had made alliance,
probably me and Clarence-- after
that, we worked hand in hand--
after-- Clarence took it
like a man, and I don't know.
But to walk away from here after
having hard feelings, and all
the comments I made, me and
Clarence was probably as
tight as anybody on the show.
So.
Brandon and Frank, can
you say the same thing?
We're good friends, yeah.
We're friendly.
[laughter]
I mean, come on.
That antipathy was pretty real.
Yeah?
I mean, I'd rather
be gone in three days
than have anybody think
I sided with Frank.
And I was gone in three days.
But yeah, it was real out there.
You know, when you
spend that much time
with somebody that is
so different from you,
and you hate them so much--
Hate's a strong
word, ain't it?
No, it's good.
It's a good word, though.
[laughter]
It's a real word
when you're out there.
And then I came home, he put
his daughters on the phone,
and then you see
him for real people.
But out there, no.
I couldn't stand him.
He wasn't the only one.
But just one of many I
didn't like out there.
[laughter]
Frank, he used the word hate.
How would you characterize your
feelings for Brandon out there?
Brandon is just
another human being.
I coexisted with him.
I don't agree with his
lifestyle, but you know--
Yeah, but he wasn't asking
you about his lifestyle.
No, but he just existed.
Beside, there was no
hunting allowed there.
So I couldn't do
anything about it.
[laughter]
Did you did you
dislike him intensely, as
intensely as he disliked you?
Not at all.
We just needed to keep
our distance and space.
Yeah.
[inaudible]
People were assuming
that, you know--
Well, I mean, look.
Carl was up there
nodding his head
behind you because Carl
and Linda had problems--
and T Bird, too--
had problems with
your whole tribe.
And I'm not taking Frank
to the waterhole for a break.
He would've killed me.
[laughter]
You know, you guys-- you had a
split along generational lines.
[interposing voices]
You were the
Geritol gang, right?
You're aware that
Kim said you guys
could've handled it better.
That as the older
people, you should have
found a way to work together.
Linda?
We were trying.
But I tell ya, those alliances
split so quickly, right away,
and that was our downfall.
And that's why there
are no Samburu people
sitting in the front row.
She's right.
T Bird, should you
have handled it better?
[inaudible] also said we tried
to pull it together and then
when the tribes were swapped
and we went over to Boran,
then once we got Brandon
and Kim and Frank,
there was still a
division that we tried
our best to pull together.
So I think the
tribal elders-- we
like to say tribal elders
instead of the Geritol
[inaudible],, we did our best
to try to pull it together.
Yeah?
Lindsey, why were
you so nasty to him?
[laughter]
Excuse me, can we
address this to all of us?
OK, [inaudible] why
were you so nasty to him?
You know what?
What really-- I mean, there's
so many different stories
of what happened out there.
But what really
happened is, I think
people just didn't
really understand what
was going on most of the time.
And things just kind
of happened so fast
and you thought you were doing
the right thing one minute,
and then the next minute,
you were questioning it.
And for me, not to mention
the emotional outbursts
and the whining, I just
think I panicked a lot
and I became paranoid
and I just wanted
to stick with the
people who I felt
like were going to protect me.
And then it just turned
nasty, and nobody wanted it to
and nobody meant
for it to happen.
It just did, and there
was just no turning back.
It was not intentional
by any means.
But it was-- you
couldn't change it.
There was no way to go back.
It was too far into it.
Is there anybody
here who didn't
have an alliance of some
sort and didn't try for one?
[laughter]
Jessie, you didn't?
I've never watched
"Survivor", so my first time
watching a full survivor,
so I was totally
unprepared for what was coming.
- Six days, adios.
Yeah.
[interposing voices]
And you didn't
try for one either?
No, it's like--
it's a funny thing
because after I stole
that food, nobody
liked me for a little while.
[laughter]
Wanted to keep me away.
Hey look, we're going
to disappear for a moment.
When we come back, we'll talk
about the hardships of Africa.
But first, as we get
into a break, let's head
to New York City where
I'm told every Thursday,
a group of Ethan's friends
gather to watch "Survivor"
and cheer him on.
Tonight, they're gathered at
a bar and they are cheering.
[cheering]
[applause]
I think I can.
I think I can.
I know I can!
Woo hoo!
[laughter]
I tell you, this Survivor
stuff, I think I can do it.
You want me to be on "Survivor".
[music playing]
[applause]
Linds, we watched
the original upstairs.
What were you thinking?
I was painted.
What, are you asking
me why I did it?
Yeah, that's all right.
To be honest, I had no idea
how to get on a show like this.
I never really
watched it, I didn't
know what the videos were like.
And my friends and I got
together and they said,
you know, you're
a great athlete.
Let's show all your
athletic endeavors.
What do you do.
Snowboard, mountain bike.
And three days before it was
due, I said, that's lame.
They're not going to
care if I mountain bike.
So my friend Hannah
took out her body paints
and painted flowers
on me and said,
you know, you've got to shock
them, you've got to stand out.
And I guess it worked.
It did.
[laughter]
Is it fair to say that
Africa was harder than you
thought it was going to be?
Oh, absolutely.
Would that apply
to everybody here?
- My God, yeah.
- Definitely.
Yeah?
I mean, I'm an athlete.
I compete regularly
in a tough sport,
and nothing, nothing, nothing
can prepare you for this.
I'm looking at a quote,
and Lex, it was you who said,
"Not a single one of us came
here thinking the danger
was going to be real."
Well, I mean, we didn't.
I remember telling some of
my friends before I left,
[inaudible] didn't, they knew
that I'd applied for the show,
and I said, you know, that
"Survivor" is like reality TV.
Half of it's reality,
half of it's TV.
But I think all of
us were universally
shocked to find
out that the animal
danger was completely real.
And those challenges--
we all came out
and everything, oh, these
are going to be fun games.
They're going to be like little
Olympic games or whatever.
But when we did that
boulder challenge,
this thing was so damn heavy.
And when we started pushing
it, and that thing started
rolling on our legs, and--
if one of us falls, and this
thing goes over our heads,
it will crush my
head like a walnut.
We could die out here.
It sounds so dramatic, but
God, the challenges were nuts.
The-- you could hear it--
Oh, there.
There, it just took Kim out.
[interposing voices]
The game was so
brutally hard and when
I came home, the first thing I
told all my friends was, when I
was able to talk about it,
was it was so much harder,
you guys have no idea.
And as a "Survivor" fan
before I went on the show--
Yeah.
We used to watch and say,
this is hard, but it's TV.
It's just television.
It's hard.
And the threats were real.
I mean, Kim, you were
crying, you heard those lions
outside the boma, yeah?
Yes, I was.
Yeah.
You could see them.
I mean, you could see their eyes
and you could see their breath.
But I'm sure most people
believe that if that lion had
gotten within three
feet of that fence,
there would have been a Mark
Burnett rocket coming through.
Mark Burnett was sleeping
very soundly family and--
[laughter]
There would have been
a big hole in the ground
where the lion was.
Not true?
That lion was
three feet from us.
I mean, it was Ethan and I,
the picket fence, and the lion.
And that's for real.
And that's pretty scary.
And I don't know
what anybody would
have done if that lion decided
to jump the boma, I don't know.
But I can tell you
from our perspective,
there was no one else around
but me and Ethan and the lion.
And then, of course,
Big Tom to the rescue.
But it was scary.
It was very scary.
Always Big Tom to the rescue.
Always Big Tom.
I think we have a question
for Big Tom up here.
Bring it on.
This question is for Big Tom.
How is your boil?
[laughter]
Brand new.
I'm in good shape now.
It's busted, gone, forgot about.
[laughter]
It was ugly.
It was disgusting.
- The boil?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
[laughter]
But let's talk a little bit
about some of the hardships
you went through.
It wasn't just the harshness
of the environment,
but also, Kel, how
difficult was it that there
was no relief from it?
There was no place where you can
go to water and just hang out,
there was no place to just
take a walk and be by yourself.
It was really intense.
It was a 24 hour a day game.
You couldn't even really afford
to sleep because people were
up talking about you all night.
You had to be on
your toes constantly.
And yeah, it was a wild ride.
But I think we all
definitely enjoyed it.
Yeah?
Frank, I saw--
Carl, I'm sorry.
I saw where you said that
if this had been in Chile,
you wouldn't have gone.
The allure was--
Africa was
definitely the allure.
But like everybody here
would agree, it was tough.
And day two-- I know I'm
speaking for my tribe--
we were struggling.
I mean, it was 100 degrees, we
had no water, we just got fire,
and it was all real.
CBS wasn't there handing
out water bottles to us.
Did you think they would be?
Absolutely not.
Guy in front of you called
it Vegetarian Survivor.
He thought it was pretty easy.
- Frank?
Yeah.
He thought it was easy?
I don't think he
thought it was easy.
It was challenging.
It was very challenging.
You disagree, Frank?
Frank?
[inaudible] in
Afghanistan right now.
The part with me was
the mental part of it,
the people part of it.
The people part
was challenging.
I disagree.
Once the animals were there, I
didn't care about the animals,
I didn't care about the heat.
No, because you were out
there talking to the elephants.
[laughter]
The people-- the
stress on the people--
because you just couldn't
blow my fuse or do something.
Did you really think you
could talk to that elephant?
Absolutely.
You can communicate
with anything
if you try hard enough.
Really?
[elephant noise]
You had it going, huh?
Speaking of relief, go 39
days with no toilet paper.
There's no relief.
Want to repeat that for me?
39 days without--
Toilet paper.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, talk about relief.
Really.
Tough.
Everybody thinks it
was a Holiday Inn, when--
just simple, little, everyday
things you take for granted.
Brushing your teeth,
or toiletries,
or just everyday things.
It's a challenge.
It's not only a hardship, but
the place is somewhat magical.
And you two got a
taste of it when you
did the goat bartering, right?
Yeah.
I mean, it's a cultural
experience that's
got to rank high on your list.
Yeah?
Definitely.
Unbelievable.
You know, you might be
surprised to learn that we
did a little research on this.
About what a goat is
really worth in Kenya.
Oh, this is the goat!
As I recall, you got, what?
$1600 for two of them?
$1800?
I think it's around there.
Around there, yeah.
You will be happy to
know that when we inquired,
a goat is worth
between $700 and $900.
All right.
You got top dollar.
Oh, there you go.
You got top dollar.
But the French fries that we
bought, those aren't worth--
[interposing voices]
[laughter]
We paid $1,400 for those.
French fries and a Coke.
He had a topper of
experience though,
when you went to
Wamba Hospital, yeah?
That was--
I mean, it sounds so cliche,
but it was really life changing.
When we were watching
the episode last week,
I don't how many
times my phone rang.
It was off the hook
when I got the truck.
And I was so excited that
I got to see that hospital.
And it was just--
it was really-- I mean,
it really opened my eyes,
to get that experience and to
see it from the inside out,
and to meet somebody--
the doctor-- the good Italian
doctor there, who is really,
literally, a living saint.
You can't help but
have that change you.
And it's special to
two of your cast members,
both of whom--
Linda and T Bird--
lost a brother to AIDS.
It had to be a very
special moment.
- Very special moment.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
In fact, once I was voted
out and I had an opportunity
to travel around with the
health care clinic that focused
on AIDS awareness and
family planning, so I was
fortunate enough to
have close to two
weeks of traveling
around with nurses who
were caring for sick people.
So it's very special.
And in fact, I saw when he was
driving off in the ambulance,
you had tears in
your eyes, T Bird.
- Yeah.
- You were crying.
You really wanted that.
Well no, actually, when they
lifted up the back of the truck
and the first box I saw, it said
HIV test kit, all of a sudden,
I knew what it was and
where they were going,
and it was actually tears that
were of joy because I knew
that they were going
to be put to good use,
and they needed to be there.
And of course, that Lex
was the one that got to go,
I like his reputation
through all this.
He's a very sensitive,
wonderful guy.
And to think that he was
going to be representing
us-- if it couldn't
be me, once again,
it was perfect that he went.
You know, what's so sweet,
that's the first thing
she told me when I got back.
She said, I'm so happy
you were able to do it.
And she was-- she truly--
those tears were tears
of joy that people
were being helped there.
[applause]
As we take a break here--
watch this, Big Tom.
Let's check out a party
going on in Tom's hometown.
Rich Valley, Virginia.
[applause]
You should put
me on "Survivor",
and let me tell you why.
On the application, you asked if
we had any body art or tattoos.
And I do.
I have a small red rose tattoo.
But you have to put me on the
show to find out where it is.
It's under these
bubbles somewhere.
[music playing]
[applause]
Oh, Kim.
This red, red rose.
Where is it?
Big Tom knows.
Oh!
I kiss, but I don't tell.
Question is, does
Sandy know Big Tom knows?
Yeah, we talked
about it last night.
She's not too upset with me.
OK.
Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Don't let me stop you.
No.
But she said it had
to be on the show,
so I can't tell anybody.
Oh, OK.
How conscious, when
you're out there,
are you of how you're
being portrayed?
I mean, is it an
omnipresent thing,
or do you think about it
just every now and then?
Silas?
Boy, that's an
interesting question.
You know, you're really not.
You're out there-- at least
from my point of view--
I was out there, like
Lex, to play the game
and to win the game.
Like Teresa.
I mean, there's only one winner.
And you're out there to win.
This isn't a team game.
And I think that you
do different things
to try to form an alliance--
Yeah, but when you
say stuff, do stuff,
were you aware of how it's
being perceived back home
and how it's going to haunt
you when you leave there?
Cameras were on you 24/7.
I was definitely aware.
- I disagree.
You were aware?
[interposing voices]
I disagree.
[interposing voices]
There were moments
where those cameras
become so normal that you
forget that they are there.
Totally.
You totally forget
that they are there.
And if you get real
hungry, it don't matter.
You don't eat.
[laughter]
If you get really
upset, it don't matter.
Brandon, you weren't
aware of them, no?
No, I wasn't.
You weren't.
I totally-- after
the first three days,
I totally started forgetting
that they were there.
I would notice more when the
still photographer was around,
because his camera made a noise.
With Monty's--
anyway, it made this
clicking noise and
I'd always jerk and I
would recognize that, but--
Yeah, you're there so long
that it's like second nature
that they're there.
But you went there, you
told me, to make a statement.
What was it?
You know, I just
hate 20-something
gay people on TV right now.
I don't ever see myself.
I see these really promiscuous
people, and I don't know.
They're caught up in this whole
party scene, and that's not me.
And I thought it would
be nice for somebody
to see you can be kind of
flamboyant and have a good time
and go out and not be
all of those people
and caught up in that lifestyle.
I didn't succeed with
proving that point, but--
I just looked like a raving
bitch, but that's OK too.
[laughter]
[interposing voices]
And Kelly, you
said you went there
because you didn't want to
be viewed as the sexy one,
like Jerri or--
Innocent one.
Sweet one, like Elizabeth,
or the dumb one, like Amber.
You wanted to be viewed as--
Oh!
[interposing voices]
No, it wasn't that I wanted
to be viewed as the smart one.
I've done a lot of research
on gender in the media,
and the way women are portrayed.
And oftentimes, they fall
into one of two roles.
Either the villain,
like Jerri kind of
came off, or the innocent
ingenue, like Elizabeth.
And my only goal was to
play it like a real person.
To just go out there, use
whatever skills I had,
which were few and
far between, and use
my intellect as I
could to just hang
around and have a good time.
Linds, you were disappointed
in how you came off, right?
Yeah, I was a little--
I can't say I was disappointed.
At first, it was a
little hard to take,
because I really didn't
think I was mean or evil
or did anything that
would come across as bad,
but I definitely had
my moments out there.
I was up and down
and all around.
I was emotional.
I said things I shouldn't have.
It was shocking at first,
because I made a lot of really
good friends, and I just didn't
think that I could ever be
portrayed as being the villain.
But you know, I was
emotional out there.
And emotions can
get the best of you.
And they got the best of me.
And you know, I
have to laugh at it.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Just let it all out.
[laughter]
We started this section
talking about a tattoo.
I'm going to finish
talking about a tattoo.
What's the fascination?
Oh, God.
I think I've-- much to the
chagrin of my mom and dad,
I started wanting them when I
was like five or six years old.
And I waited a while, but
now, I can't seem to stop.
Yeah?
And if River comes to you and
says, Dad, I want to get one.
He can get one
as soon as he's 18.
Oh!
We have an age limit.
That's the law.
OK.
If I had gotten half of
my tattoos before I was 18,
I'd probably be covered with--
I'd have an Iron Maiden
rocker on my chest,
and I'd have a bunch of
stuff I probably don't want.
[interposing voices]
Captain Kangaroo, a big
Captain Kangaroo on my chest.
They look good.
They look good.
Coming up, we're going to talk
of images and perceptions,
and how often both can
be at odds with reality.
But first, Big Tom
gets his big break.
Go ahead.
Give us a sample.
You gave us a sample of your
musical talent in Africa.
If you missed it, here
he is with an encore.
Big Tom, floor is yours.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
(SINGING) Hey bartender, fix
me a toddy, [inaudible] party.
Open that window,
close the door.
[inaudible]
[laughter]
[cheering]
In the gym, I
was on the court.
Cardiovascular, pumping iron.
All State, number one.
[applause]
[laughter]
You know what,
stand up for a second.
I was telling her earlier.
Now I've done all of these.
You got the best abs anybody
ever had on the show.
Give us a shot.
Give a shot.
Yeah!
[cheering]
[interposing voices]
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah.
Kim's got better abs?
Yeah.
Really?
Kim's better.
Yeah.
Kim?
Show them off, baby.
That's all right, thank you.
No?
Look, before we proceed,
let's do a preview.
Having tested competitors
in the African wilderness,
the Australian Outback,
and the South China Sea,
"Survivor" is on the move again,
revving up for a fourth season
of surprises.
Jeff Probst has the
first look at what
the next set of
survivors will face,
in a place both
exotic and dangerous,
and about as far from
civilization as one can get.
[music playing]
JEFF PROBST: Soon,
16 new strangers
will be abandoned in
the middle of the most
remote place on Earth.
The Marquesas, part of
Tahiti's mystical islands
in the South Pacific.
Thousands of miles from
the nearest continent,
it is a place of rugged beauty
with magnificent waterfalls,
towering banyan
trees, and a backyard
home to some of the most
exotic and dangerous sea
life in the world.
This island, with
a history steeped
in superstition and violence,
will be their home for 39 days.
And for the first time,
these survivors will
be given no rations whatsoever.
No food, no water, no fire.
With only the barest
of essentials,
they must fend for
themselves, utilizing
the resources of the land and
their own survival skills.
It is a difficult, but
not impossible, task.
Everything they need to
survive is on the island.
Their success will depend upon
their ability to work together
to create a new
society while battling
the elements and each other.
It is the ultimate challenge.
Outwit, outplay, outlast, until
only one remains and emerges
as the sole survivor.
[music playing]
[applause]
"Survivor: Marquesas".
Given the chance, who'd go?
Oh yeah.
Come on, all you?
[interposing voices]
Wait, wait, wait.
[inaudible]
[laughter]
You'd do it all again?
Yeah.
[interposing voices]
Let me ask you something.
Does it help to
have watched before?
I mean, I ask that because
Brandon, Kelly, Linda,
arguably, you three were the
biggest "Survivor" fans of all,
going into this, right?
You see where we ended up.
Well, that's why I'm asking.
How much does it help?
I don't think--
it doesn't.
[interposing voices]
The least you
know, the better.
I mean, I think that the
overplanning, the constant
racking your brain, and I'm
like, what am I going to do?
Building strategies,
it kills you.
I mean, it totally kills you.
I think going into it just kind
of relaxed and ah, whatever,
kind of fly under the radar.
I think that's the
best way to go.
With all due
respect, let me hear
from the front row on this.
[laughter]
Does it help?
I think it helps.
I watched the other "Survivors".
Not religiously,
but I watched them.
And it definitely helped me
figure out which way to go.
Maybe you watch Rudy, right?
And then you figured out just
how to do it correctly, right?
know There's Rudy with us today.
Nice seeing you, Rudy.
We're going to come on
back in just a little bit
and close up here.
First, we'll take a
break as our "Survivor:
Africa" Reunion continues
live from Los Angeles.
[music playing]
[applause]
[applause]
And you and your band got a
new recording contract, yeah?
That's right.
My band, Lucky Dog,
just got a record deal.
How tough is it going to be
now to return to normal life?
Or do you still get
stopped at the supermarket
and everything else?
Yeah?
- It's wonderful.
- Really?
You like it?
It's a blast.
It's so much fun.
I mean, people still
get so excited.
It's just so much fun.
If you're a people person,
it's a dream come true.
If you're not a people
person, it's a nightmare.
And you friends
to last a lifetime.
Ethan, you had the first
word, you get the last.
How are you going
to spend the money?
Well, I owe my brothers
probably about 27 years
worth of birthday presents.
So I think I'm going
to start there.
Yeah?
But I'd like to
do something good.
And a dream come true.
- Yeah, it's a dream come true.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
Guys, congratulations
to all of you.
Diane, Jessie, Carl, Linda,
Silas, Lindsay, Clarence, T
Bird, Kim, Frank,
Brandon, Kelly,
Big Tom, Lex, Kim J, and Ethan.
Congratulations, guys.
I'm Bryant Gumbel.
The tribe has spoken.
Goodnight.
