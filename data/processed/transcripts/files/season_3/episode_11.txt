        JEFF PROBST: Previously on
Survivor: Kim was upset that
Brandon abandoned their alliance
to join forces with Lex.
I was set up by somebody who
I thought was my friend.
PROBST: And Lex's motives
were in question because of his
alliance with Brandon.
He has no loyalty to me.
He has no loyalty to Tom.
He has no loyalty to Kim.
He only has loyalty to you.
PROBST: The African bush was
beginning to take its toll.
Tom's got a massive boil.








I mean, it's big.
I've never seen a boil that big.
PROBST: Lex won immunity and
wanted to vote for Frank at
Tribal Council, but everyone
else, including Kim, joined
forces and voted Brandon out of
the tribe.
Seven are left.
Tonight, one more will go.

At the last Tribal Council,
we voted off Brandon, and you
know, we had been pals since our
early days in Samburu.
But you know, I felt very
betrayed by him from the
previous Tribal Council and I
didn't trust him any longer,
so I had to vote him out.








I guess it's all part of the
game, but it still tugged at my
heart a little bit.
Tom, Ethan, Kim and I are all
still standing, and we've got an
advantage now.
We've got everyone else
outnumbered.
But they knew what I was pretty
close to Brandon.
He was a friend, and that I'd
have a really hard time voting
for him, and I didn't vote for
him.
We're still solid right?
We're still solid from day one,
right?
100%, absolutely.
All right.
All right.
Lex's vote, I think, just
pushed the limits of our
alliance.
It kind of redefined how tight
our bonds were.
You know, he gave his word to
Brandon, but he gave his word to
us, also.
Lex kind of went out an his own
and covered his own ass.
He gave his word to me, you
and Tom, and he gave his word to
Brandon.
Why was his word just as strong
with Brandon as it was with us?
As much as Tommy, Lex and
Ethan think that they want to go
into the finals, the three of
them, I don't really think that
they do.
I think that they're all
skeptical of each other, and
they know, when it gets down to
crunch time, that one of them
is going to have to be voted
off.
Is going to have to be voted
off.
What the hell was that?
(lion roaring loudly)
Ho...
(roaring, huffing)
Me and little Kim were on the
2:00 to 4:00 shift and out of
nowhere we just heard lots of
heavy grunting moving closer and
closer and closer.
(lion grunting)
I think the lion is probably
stalking, but I don't know why
it would make a noise if...
(roaring)
I thought they made that
noise when they were calling
other lions to come feed.
You might be right.
You know what was scary, was
the fact that you had no idea
what the lion wanted.
Are they just communicating, or
is it trying to call the other
lion in because it smells us?
(lion growling)
Yeah, he wants to come and
eat...
(loud growling)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
The perimeter is closed in all
the way with the acacia bush or
thorn bushes all the way around,
but it's only maybe six feet
tall, and I'm sure a lion would
be able to get up and over it if
they wanted in.
(lion roaring loudly)
It's close.
I'll protect you.
Obviously, they live right
here, and they must watch us
every day when we go for water
as we come out in the morning
and do stuff.
They are really here.
They are really, like, right in
this area.
I still feel vulnerable.
It's not our land at all.
It's their land, and we're just
living in it for 39 days.
(roaring)
I think it went, "Kim, Kim,
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim."
I think I heard it say that.
Hey, Zonyo!
What's up, buster?
You just wear yourself out
walking over here?
I'm dead.
Having been out here now for
a month, it's just starting to
catch up with us.
Everybody's started to feel more
lethargic, weaker, and it all...
It's interesting because it all
happened at the same time.
And we felt comfortable
admitting it because it was
obvious that everyone was
feeling the same way.
Whoa.
It feels like you're walking
under water, so your steps are
slow, your legs are a little,
like, shaky.
You don't pick your feet up as
high off the ground because you
just don't want to, so you kind
of stumble on even just little
roots this big.
Oh, mama cat.
Isn't that weird?
Holy mackerel.
Poor Kim Johnson, her legs
are really, really swollen from
her knees down.
I mean really swollen.
She can hardly lace up her
sneakers.
You just push it with your
finger and it stays.
It's like Silly Putty or
something.
I know.
It's actually almost climbing
up.
Wait till it gets to my breasts.
Whoa!
Look out then!
Our bodies are starting to
show signs of trouble.
We're start to get sick.
In the last couple, three days,
we've all noticed that we're
getting thinner.
It's starting to really show.
Man, you've lost a ton of
weight.
Yeah, I'd say I've lost 40
pounds.
40 pounds?
Wow.
Let's decide: do we want the
mush or do we want the gruel
this morning?
We eat two small meals a day.
I figure we're having, I don't
know, maybe a couple of hundred
calories, if that.
And we're eating, I think, just
enough to fool our bodies into
thinking that we're getting
nutrition when we really aren't.
It's ready.
We have maize.
It's cornmeal, basically, is
what it is, so we eat that
either in just, like, mushed-up
balls we boil in water.
And then we snack on, like,
kernels of corn.
They don't really pop, but we
brown them and burn them.
These are just too hard for me.
They just, they hurt my teeth.
Mm-hmm.
Then we make a corn broth soup.
I'm eating it and I don't
really want to.
It's just kind of a... just a
watery gruel with some, you
know, some corn kernels in it.
It's just so hard to get down
because it's... it's like eating
chalk twice a day and then they
put corn in it and then you've
got chalk with some corn.
(burps)
Lex is worried.
He's worried because he knows
I didn't like what he done.
At the last Tribal Council, Lex
cast a vote for Frank instead of
Brandon.
We had an alliance, me him and
Ethan, and the alliance was we'd
vote together, and Lex
jeopardized that alliance when
he voted for Frank.
Before I came into this
thing, I was totally 100% anti-
alliance.
I wanted to do it myself and all
by myself.
But I realized that's
impossible.
You can't do it.
You can't do it.
I felt betrayed.
I don't understand why you
don't let Lex know.
Because when he made that
agreement with Brandon, he
didn't come to me.
He didn't come to you either.
He did it on his own.
All he was worried about was
Lex.
Now he's got to thinking about
me and you, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
I know Tom's true to me and
Kim, but probably take a little
bit to get Lex back on his good
side.
I don't know what'll happen
in the future, but from here on
out, you know, I'll have
question with Lex.
What's up, boys?
Hey.
Hey.
Mail?
Can you guess the hint?
That is such a cool clue!
Look here.
Look, look.
What's the difference between
the pig and me?
No boil on the pig.
That's what I said!
"You'll need all your
strength for events down the
road.
Today is a great day for a good
carbo load."
Pasta.
"Proteins and sugars will
give you power to burn.
So if you are clever, these
gifts you may earn."
So if you are clever, these
gifts you may earn."
PROBST: All right, guys.
For today's reward challenge, we
thought we'd give you a break on
the challenge.
And just make it pure reward.
Yeah!
PROBST: You each have a
personalized wallet.
Go ahead and open it up.
You've each got 20,000 Kenyan
shillings inside.
We're going to have a little bit
of an auction... Survivor
auction.
Yeah.
PROBST: Just so you know in
advance, there's a pre-
determined number of items.
The auction will end abruptly.
You can bid in 500 shilling
increments.
One American U.S. dollar roughly
equivalent to 100 shillings.
It's okay to share as long as
you're pooling money.
You guys ready for the first
item?
Yes, sir.
PROBST: All right.
First item at the Survivor
auction: a hot cup of coffee,
some sugar and a nice big
chocolate croissant.
Anybody want to give me 3,000
shillings?
3,000.
PROBST: Lex, 3,000.
Anybody want to go 35?
No.
PROBST: 3,000... once, twice,
sold to Lex.
Come on up and take a sample.
You got a bargain.
Pay up, please.
Thank you.
Oh, how is that?
Lex.
Yeah, Lex.
How is it?
Smile, buddy, smile.
It's good to see you smile.
PROBST: How about cheese and
crackers, 4,000 shillings?
Four grand.
45.
I'll go five grand.
6,000.
PROBST: Going once, going
twice, sold to K.J.
Look at that.
PROBST: That's good.
Okay, next item.
Oh, wow.
Oh, Lex.
PROBST: A nice cold beer.
Why don't we start that at 4,000
shillings?
Big Tom, you've got to be
missing beer.
1,000.
I'll give you 1,000.
It started at four.
I don't care.
I'll bid 1,000.
PROBST: Sold to big Tom,
1,000 shillings.
Nice! What a bargain!
Yeah!
Whoo-whoo!
Chug a lug!
Sorry, boys.
Enjoy it.
How is it?
Easy, big guy, don't drip it.
Don't spill it now.
All right!
I can bid better with a
little drink in me.
PROBST: That there is a
sundae.
That's a lot of chocolate syrup.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
PROBST: Tell me this is not
worthy of at least 6,000
shillings.
6,000.
PROBST: 6,000... Kim.
65.
Seven.
75.
PROBST: 75.
It may not get any better than
this.
Eight.
PROBST: 8,000 for the sundae,
to Kim.
85.
PROBST: 85 to Big Tom.
Oh, Tom.
Nine.
Ten.
PROBST: 10 to Big Tom.
10,000 shillings to Big Tom.
10,500.
PROBST: 10,500 to Kim.
Let her have it.
PROBST: Wait a second.
Is there a dispute?
Is there a dispute?
No... 11.
No, it's 11.
PROBST: 11,000 to Big Tom.
I'll have, like, nothing
left... 11,500.
Twelve.
PROBST: 12,000 shillings for
the sundae.
Oh, God, you guys are killing
me.
12,500.
PROBST: 12,500.
Let her have it.
I can't do her that way.
PROBST: Going once, twice,
sold to Kim.
Yeah!
How is it?
I can't talk.
Good job, Kim.
Oh, my God.
PROBST: How good does that
chocolate syrup look right now?
It's so hot, you guys.
It's like...
PROBST: What did you pay for
that?
I don't have... I don't care.
It doesn't matter.
Not enough.
I'll give you a grand for a
bite.
A grand?
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
1,500.
(laughing)
PROBST: What if I were to
offer you a mug of pure
chocolate syrup?
5,000 shillings.
I'll go 5.
PROBST: 5,000 for the
chocolate syrup to Ethan.
Going once, going twice.
Sold to Ethan, 5,000.
Good buy, Ethan.
It's hot.
PROBST: The next item is a
mystery item.
It could be good.
It could be a gag.
We'll start it at 7,500.
I'll go 75.
PROBST: 7500 to Ethan.
I'll go 8.
Nine.
PROBST: 9,000 shillings to
Big Tom.
You guys must think it's good.
Ten.
PROBST: 10,000 shillings to
Ethan for mystery item number
one.
You want to split it?
I'm not sure.
I don't want to get gooned.
Eleven.
PROBST: 11,000 to K.J.
Big Tom, you back in?
11,000 to Kim.
Going once, going twice...
I can't look.
PROBST: You just bought a
hell of a meal.
(all shouting, cheering)
Fried chicken.
With cheese on top of it, Kim.
Fried chicken.
Oh, Teresa, I'm so sorry.
Don't look.
Kim, I'll give you seven for
half.
Fried chicken and mashed
potatoes.
That's the best thing I've
ever had in my whole life.
Kim, I'll give you seven
grand for half.
I'll give you five just for
the potatoes.
PROBST: I don't think she's
hearing any of you guys right
now.
I don't think she hears a thing.
Teresa, I'll sell you a piece
of chicken.
How much, Kim?
Well, this cost me a lot.
4,000 for a piece of chicken.
I'll do it for five.
Lex will do it for 5.
5,500.
I'll give you six for that
piece of chicken.
Six for the chicken.
Do I hear seven?
Do I hear seven?
T-Bird.
Go and get yourself that
chicken.
6,500?
Do I hear seven?
No, I'll hold out.
PROBST: Teresa, what are you
holding out for?
Fried chicken and potatoes.
It's here.
That has Georgia written all
over it.
And a bite of potatoes?
A bite of potatoes for 8,000.
For the potatoes, two bites of
potatoes and the chicken.
Go, Teresa, what else are you
going to buy?
I'll buy it.
Okay.
8,500.
8,000, going once.
8,500.
No, no, you got 8,500.
10 for half the potatoes and
that chicken.
That means you only paid 2,000
for it.
Okay, 10 for half the
potatoes and the chicken.
Do I hear 10,500?
Going once, going twice...
Let me help you, Kim.
Sold.
Sold to the man.
Mmm.
Is that delicious?
PROBST: Next item... should I
keep it as a mystery or tell you
what it is?
No, no.
Show it to us.
PROBST: Okay.
Oh, yeah!
Go, baby, that's good.
You be the bid.
You just go.
PROBST: That's a hoagie.
Oh, God, and it has provolone
cheese on it.
Teresa, bid.
PROBST: Let's start this at
9,000.
9,000.
PROBST: 9,000 to Teresa.
Is it time to pool money?
Get creative.
Move along, move along.
This auction will not go on
forever.
Ten.
PROBST: 10 to Big Tom.
Go 11.
10,500.
PROBST: 10,500 to Teresa.
11,000.
11,500.
PROBST: 11,500.
Splitting it?
Twelve.
PROBST: 12 to Big Tom.
12,500.
13.
13,500.
14.
14,500.
PROBST: 14 to Big Tom,
14,500, Teresa.
PROBST: 14,500 to Teresa.
15.
15.500.
PROBST: 15.5 to Teresa.
16.
PROBST: 16 to big Tom.
16,500.
Give me a thousand, I'll quit
bidding.
Nope.
PROBST: You tapped out, Big
Tom?
I've met my limit.
PROBST: 16,500 to Teresa...
Going once, twice, sold.
Come up and have a bite, woman.
Finally, you're in this game.
Yeah, Teresa.
Good job, "T."
How good is it?
Good enough to make you want
to slap your mama.
PROBST: Let's make this a
mystery item.
Let's start the bidding at 9,000
shillings.
You want to split it?
Sure.
Nine.
PROBST: 9,000 to Big Tom.
Anybody else want in on this?
Mystery item.
Sold to Big Tom for 9,000.
Now, I did you right last time.
You really did.
PROBST: Okay, so we're even.
All right.
PROBST: So take a look.
Open that baby up.
He did me wrong.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you, I'll kill you,
after I kiss you.
Yea!
Whoo!
Ham.
He's a Jew, and he won't eat the
ham.
He's a Jew.
He's a Jew.
PROBST: Big Tom, wait.
Big Tom, come here.
Whoa, be careful.
I just want to see you enjoy
this.
He won't eat the ham.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
That's all right.
PROBST: Half that meal that
he just split with you he's not
going to eat.
He won't eat that.
I mean I hate it for him.
I hate it for him.
I wished he would.
PROBST: Ethan, get down here
and take a little bite of this.
I'll spend every penny I got
and I don't care.
Good buy, my friend.
PROBST: Here's your syrup.
We hit the jackpot.
Yeah, we did.
PROBST: My friends, that's
it.
The auction is closed.
Hope you had fun.
I did.
I did.
That chicken, I think I just
lost it.
I haven't been that excited
since the bow and arrow.
I cannot believe I had a pot
of chocolate.
That damn beer was good.
In the food auction, you
could definitely see alliance
lines and relationship lines
that apply to the game itself.
I mean, Kim and I have been
close since the get-go.
Tom and Ethan have been very
close too.
T. Bird and Frank, no
surprise there.
They've really only got each
other at this point.
And also, it is kind of
painfully obvious that Kim
Powers is kind of on her own.
But there are people taking care
of her there.
Thanks, Big Tom.
I remember you sitting there,
and the last thing you said,
"Oh, what I'd give for ice
cream," and I went...
It was interesting to
see who's a more clever and
shrewd wheeler and dealer.
Tom probably walked away the
biggest winner as far as food.
Pancake, did you like the
pancake?
Yeah, really.
I mean it, I feel bad.
You got your ham, Big Tom.
Tom, he is not the most
politically correct human being,
so when he said this he was
sharing the ham with the Jew
boy, knowing that he wasn't
going to eat it, I was like,
"Oh, my God."
I'm sorry.
Yeah, that was...
I'm a Caucasian, call me
anything.
What am I?
Call me... a beatnik.
What is a beatnik?
I mean, at this point, I
really don't take offense.
I know he's joking.
You know, he doesn't really mean
it.
Man, you can play some checkers.
He thinks a lot before he moves.
Me and Tom, we have kind of
like almost like a brotherly
relationship right now.
He makes fun of me 'cause I'm
Jewish and I make fun of him
'cause he's fat and he's got a
boil on his neck and there's
just, like, competition, you
know, he's going to beat me at
checkers.
Oh... man.
Don't do that.
He's a checker shark.
I go back and forth on
whether or not I think Tom is
for real or some of it's put on,
because I think he's smarter
than he lets on.
Stupid me.
Tommy, he plays a good old
boy, but I don't think he's as
backwoods-ish as he would like
to make you think.
Checkmate.
We're just totally done already?
Yeah.
Oh, my God, that's pathetic.
He's very good.
You know, his whole, you
know, I'm a hayseed from
Virginia, I'm not that smart.
I knew quickly that he was a lot
brighter than he let on.
And actually, I mean that
endeared me to him and intrigued
me all the more.
What is it you think you're
doing?
You're both going forward.
You're back to back.
Well, the door's this way.
That's funny.
Are you all right, man?
Yeah.
Are they zebra?
Yeah, zebra.
A big herd, ain't it?
Yeah, a big herd.
Thundering herd.
Hey, mama cat, bring it on up
here.
Okay.
We have been kind of in a
routine, so today, to keep
things fresh, we went to our
watering hole, put our stuff
down and Big Tom gave everyone a
little shower.
Oh, man.
Tommy, I'll take a shower.
Okay, brother.
We have been here a while,
and we were getting pretty
comfortable with each other, and
I can change without being too
worried if anyone sees me.
You know, I can fart, you know,
and not really care.
All right, girls, back off.
You can douse me.
When you spend 30 days with
people in very close proximity,
you're not ashamed or bashful of
just about anything anymore.
I mean, we've lived together
closer than most families live
together and bathing or
whatever, it just seems like
it's something that you kind of
have to do it, and you really
don't care who sees you anymore.
Tom's loving every minute of it.
Woo-hoo, does that feel good!
Tom gets away with murder.
Like today, you know, he was
having a good time bathing the
ladies, having them kind of pull
their bathing suits back.
Don't think Tom doesn't know
what he's doing.
Tom's not washing you.
At all.
I mean Tommy's harmless.
It's not, like, he's going to,
like, jump our bones there
or anything.
He's really harmless and if he
gets a peek, you know, more
power to him.
It doesn't do any good for
anybody to take offense at
anybody.
It only costs you friendship,
and this whole exercise out here
I think is about getting along
with people and just going with
the flow.
Encore!
We have been here a while and
we're getting pretty comfortable
with each other, and it's like
your family now.
And it makes everything a little
more difficult because tomorrow,
I'm going to have to vote one of
these people off.
PROBST: Hey, guys, welcome to
this abandoned boma.
You'll be playing today's
challenge here.
As always, first things first.
I'll take this back.
Immunity is back up for grabs.
Okay.
Today's challenge is going to
test how well you remember the
African story I'm about to tell
you.
But first, here's what you'll
have to do.
We've set up seven gated
stations, and only one person at
a time can be there, so make
sure you close the gate behind
you.
Each station has a question and
two ostrich eggs.
Break open the egg for the
correct answer.
You'll find a piece of colored
leather.
Wrap that around the same color
on your staff.
If you answer incorrectly,
you'll find nothing, you'll have
to try again later.
The eggs will be replaced after
each person leaves the station.
First person back in the circle
with five of the seven questions
answered correctly and five
pieces of leather on their staff
wins immunity.
Okay.
Story time.
Today, I'm going to tell you
about the Samburu warrior.
When a baby boy is born, his
destiny is already planned.
To celebrate the birth, a goat
is sacrificed.
The women of the tribe eat the
meat of the goat because the
women are the caretakers of the
tribe.
For the first four days after
the birth, the mother drinks
only the blood of the goat.
Around the age of nine or ten,
the boy has his first rite of
passage.
This is the removal of his two
bottom middle teeth because if
he were to get sick and they
needed to get food or water into
his body, they use the gap from
the two missing teeth as a way
to do that.
It's also around this time that
he begins the practice of
piercing his ears.
This is the first cosmetic
enhancement.
His next rite of passage is a
circumcision, and that begins
with a journey to find gum from
a special tree.
It could take him as long 45
days, during which he can only
subsist on the generosity of
others.
The food that he gets along the
way.
Once he's completed his mission,
a date for the circumcision is
set.
Dates are scheduled based on the
new moon.
The tribe will wait for any
even-numbered day of moonlight.
Eighth day, considered the best
day.
In preparation for a
circumcision, shaves his head.
But the most important aspect to
a circumcision is the
warrior's reaction.
If, during the circumcision, he
flinches in any way, he and his
family are forever shamed.
After eight years of
warriorship, he's eligible for
marriage.
Tribal custom demands that he
continue to have kids until he
has a boy, even if that means
taking another wife and another.
The last step: Death.
Once a warrior is close to
death, he is taken into the bush
with another warrior and left to
die.
Once he dies, fellow warriors
shave their heads out of
respect, and his body is left
for the hyenas to eat.
From birth to death, a hard
life.
Now we're going to see what
you've learned.
Grab your staffs and let's get
it on.
Survivors ready?
Go!
Make sure you close your gates.
Food provided by others.
"What happens after a warrior
dies?"
"What happens after a warrior
dies?"
Oh, hell.
Well, I can't cry over spilt
milk.
I missed it.
PROBST: Frank and Lex, each
with one.
"Reaction of the warrior."
"What must be done when a
child is born?"
PROBST: Lex, Frank and Kim
Johnson all have one.
"Eighth day of moonlight."
"The reaction of the
warrior."
PROBST: Teresa and Kim Powers
now also have one.
"First act of tribal
beautification is: removal of
the two bottom teeth, piercing
of the ear.
Piercing of the ear."
PROBST: Lex and Frank in the
lead with two each.
Oh, hell.
That ain't right.
"Body left in the bush for
hyenas to eat."
Or maybe not!
"Shave his head."
PROBST: Lex and Frank lead
with four.
Everybody else at three.
PROBST: You got it, Lex?
One, two, three, four.
I dropped one.
PROBST: Gotta find it, Lex.
Gotta find it.
Lex says he has five, but he
can't find his fifth.
Get it on there, baby.
Lex trying to get his in the
right spot.
We're still alive.
God.
I've got to be careful.
Lex wins immunity again.
Lex, again, you're not going
down.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
PROBST: You're safe from the
vote.
Somebody else is going home.
I'll see you at Tribal Council.
To be here is just awesome.
This morning's sunrise is just,
is just, so beautiful.
You know, I don't think the
majority of people in our
everyday, busy lives take a
moment to just watch something
as beautiful as that, and to
suddenly realize just how small
we are in the world, and how
time can just pass by in a
moment and we would be gone.
You know, it puts your life back
in perspective.
Nice sunrise.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
My love for being here grows
every day.
Just loving the outdoors, you
know, and the animals and
wildlife and people in a way, as
well, you know; I love to mingle
with people.
Good morning, Ethan.
Good morning.
How are you?
Good.
Breakfast.
Are we having soup?
Uh-huh.
I love your soup.
You love my soup?
I love the soup.
Good.
Good, good, good.
As always, very tasty.
I mean really.
It's just a beautiful
morning, so I was just adding to
the wonderful atmosphere and
just socializing and, you know,
let them see there's a soft,
sensual side of me.
My argument always with the
gun, you know, activist, is that
they think that guns kill
people.
There's, like... there's
everything else you could kill
someone with, you know, a piece
of fishing line I can kill
somebody with.
Hit them over the head with a
brick.
You know, automobiles kill
people every day, drug overdose,
malpractice, just everything.
All right, enough.
Frank seems really
rambunctious this morning and
he's talking a lot.
And he's a very opinionated
person, which is fine, but,
like, when you have immunity at
stake, you kind of just need to
keep your mouth shut.
I can't help it.
These little liberal special
interest groups that the media
give open market to instead of
the average working-class
Americans that founded this
country.
All right! All right!
Well, what can I say about
Frank?
Once again, Frank is Frank.
You know, Ray might invite me
to their banquet, their
convention down there.
Perfect.
He brings up this gun stuff.
Lex is going like this, you
know.
Ethan's sitting over there not
saying a word, but I can tell
it's getting to him, too.
And I'm thinking to myself,
Frank, cut it, stop.
Why is it on the days that you
need to be most careful of how
you act and what you say, Frank,
like, goes off on the A.R. or
whatever stuff?
Yeah.
Well, that's just the way... he
ain't going to change.
Today is Tribal Council day.
Today is the day that you don't
want to really ruffle any
feathers.
But you know, I started out from
the very beginning with an
alliance with Frank, and shoot,
I've been here for this many
days.
I'm sure not going to give up
now.
This is all going exactly as
we wanted it to.
Things couldn't be any better.
The guys have dominated the
game.
They're saying who goes next.
If nothing else, I'd like to see
the women get in there.
Right.
Teresa doesn't want to give
up and I don't want to give up
either.
So, Teresa is, like, trying to
scramble and see if there's
anything that we can do.
Ethan's going to take the
whole thing.
He's great.
What can you say negative about
Ethan?
Nothing.
It's a shot in the dark, but
if I can persuade Kim to vote
off Ethan, that would break up
that alliance.
If Ethan's not here...
That would leave Kim, you, me
and Frank.
You, me and Frank.
And then you're going to
stick by Frank.
No.
If you do this tonight, then
I'll pledge my loyalty to you.
It could hurt me going to Kim,
but Ethan's bonded with those
guys, and they're going to be
strong enough every time they
vote to weed off one more of us.
So it's kind of a risk, but at
this point, I feel like this is
the only chance I've got.
I was really shocked and
pissed that they would even, you
know...
Well, they're cornered.
There's no options.
Teresa approached me with the
idea that Tommy, Lex and Ethan
really don't have any kind of
allegiance toward me, but I just
can't turn on Ethan at this
point.
So I'm going to have to tell
Teresa that, and I'm not sure
what the reaction to that is
going to be.
I just think, so really, that I
think I might still be shooting
myself in the foot, even if I
could bring myself to it do it.
Okay, I understand.
I just appreciate you're telling
us so we can do different stuff.
I had an opportunity,
obviously, to do something to
save them and I didn't do that.
And now I'm afraid it's going to
hurt me.
This plan's not coming together.
I know it's not.
So it'll be an interesting
Tribal Council.
So it'll be an interesting
Tribal Council.
PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.
30 days.
Congratulations.
You made it a long ways.
Basically a month out here on
your own.
Well, obviously, from this point
forward, the power shifts from
the tribe members left to the
jury that is growing.
Your dilemma is obvious: How can
you vote somebody out of this
game, take that million dollars
out of their hand and then ask
them to put it in your hands by
voting you most deserving?
Teresa, what goes through your
head now as you show up tonight
and here's Brandon and Kelly?
People you had a hand in voting
out, you're going to need them
later.
For me, I guess it takes just
the way I play the game, trying
to be as honest with everybody,
you know, that I could be, so at
this point, it's just playing as
fair as I can and hope that
they'll respect, you know, my
decisions and how I played.
PROBST: Ethan, one of you
seven is going tonight.
Next Tribal Council, they'll be
sitting over there.
How can you vote them out and
ask them to vote for you at the
end?
Well, you've just got to hope
that what you did before the
vote and how you treated people
before the vote will, you know,
put you in a good light.
It is just a game, and if you
get voted out, it's just a
strategy.
You've got to look out for
yourself in the end.
PROBST: Lex, how close is
this game to turning ugly?
I think the game has already
gone through some ugly times.
I think it's taken a turn for
the better.
It's probably going to get ugly
again.
But everyone here, whether
they're, you know, sitting up
here or on the jury, realizes,
though, that they came to play a
game and to win.
And you can do that with
integrity, but to come in here
thinking that it's never going
to be, you know, just a bones-
to-bones competition is to be
naive.
PROBST: Frank, do you feel
like it's still the old Samburu
and the old Boran when it comes
down to voting?
Not really because the game
is changing, you know.
I think those old tribal names
are gone.
Our tribe had a new name, I
think everybody belonged to it.
I think it's a strategy within
the new tribe.
PROBST: Kim, do you feel that
you might be safer because maybe
people don't see you as such a
physical threat, or are you
worried that maybe you're too
likable and, therefore, you've
got to go?
I'm always worried.
I think I would be worried if I
were strong and I'm worried
because I'm not so strong.
It doesn't matter how nice I am
or how weak I am or how strong I
am.
If I'm the logical person to go,
I'm going.
PROBST: All right, it's time
to vote.
Lex is the only one you can't
vote for.
Everybody else is fair game.
Kim, you're up first.
I've enjoyed you as a person,
but we have to vote somebody off
and you're my next logical
choice.
I'll miss you, though.
It's been good for me to be
around someone so different from
myself and learn from you.
I'm glad that we actually got to
spend some time together.
I'm glad that we actually got to
spend some time together.
This is not a vote of betrayal.
This is a vote of strategy.
Frank, thank you so much for the
friendship.
Frank, thank you so much for the
friendship.
PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote: Frank.
Kim Johnson.
Frank.
Frank.
Three votes Frank;
one vote Kim.
Frank.
That's enough, Frank.
You need to bring me your torch.
Frank, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.
You guys can head back to camp.
