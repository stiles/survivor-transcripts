We are carving
a path along the equator
through the scorching desert of
Kenya in Eastern Africa,
where these
16 Americans are about to begin
the adventure of
a lifetime.
They're about to be abandoned
in the heart of one of the most
diverse and dangerous
collection of animals
anywhere on the continent:
zebras,
elephants, giraffes, lions,
just a sampling of the wildlife
that call this place home.








Temperatures here can reach
120 degrees, water is scarce.
It is a land virtually untouched
by the modern world.
For the next 39 days,
these 16 strangers will be left
to fend for themselves,
forced to
create a new society,
while battling the elements
and each other.
They must learn to adapt,
or they'll be
voted out of the tribe.
In the end, only one will remain
to claim the $1 million prize.
39 days,
16 people, one survivor.

We have no fire yet,

The gourds
are very fragile.

when you don't cap the water

I don't know if this makes any
sense, but Mother Africa,
and I've been here before,
I have tremendous respect,
and when the tribe was
joking about the tamborunos

reaction to that,
inside I was thinking, "Oh, my
God, that is so disrespectful.
The Samburu people, you know,

Do you realize where

This is where it
all started, folks, in Africa."

the water.
You know what I mean?

I'm terrified.
It's sick-- I mean, I was
filling it up, and it was so...
it was this deep, so you get
water mixed with crud.
- We're pulling water out of a
very, like, murky...
tadpoles are
running all over it,
like pond scum, kind of
little water hole.
So the water
is contaminated,

least five minutes over a fire
before we
can drink it.
- Okay.
- Take your time.
- You don't have to go fast.
- Right.
It's in the technique.
- You can do it.

a little oxygen here.
- Let me know
when you're ready.

to have a fire,

said without the fire,
you can't
live in this land.
Fire is not for warmth,
what everyone would think
of right away

security right away,

three to five minutes.

purified for us to drink.

Clarence some water
and they
just ate a can of beans.
- Diane said the best thing to
do would be to open up,
get her
something to eat,
because we wanted to get her
strength up.
She said, "Well, maybe something
to eat will help."
So I said,
"Well, I'll do that.
"I'll open up a can, maybe get
some food in you,
that'll make
you feel better."
- Hey, Clarence, Diane talked
like you wanted to eat something
while we were gone.
If you have,
you need to kind of fess up.
Explain why you thought you
should eat a can of food.
- I got her
something to eat,
so we split it while you
were gone
just so she could
feel better and she does,
I mean, I ain't got
to eat.
It ain't no big deal.
- It's a big deal
to me.
- It's a big
deal to me, too.
- And I want to make it
straight now.
Anybody that eats without
the rest of us, it's a big deal.
-I opened a can because she
needed something to eat.
It was
a judgment call.
It was a judgment
call I made.
- It was
a bad damn judgment.
- There's eight of us.
- You guys were gone.
- It don't matter-- We're
all making it.
You can't make
the decision to eat the food.
- Tommy, Tommy.
- Tommy, hell.
- I had to open it
for her.
- You didn't
have to open it for her.
- Are you a doctor-- Let me
see your license.
You ain't no doctor.
- I'm saying I made a call
for her.
I did not
open a can for me.
I opened a can
for her.
- But did you eat any?
- Yes.
- Okay, well,
that's the whole point here.
- You made the call for
you, bro.
- You made
the call for you, too.
- You made the call for
all of us.
And I don't
think you got that right.
You don't eat without
all of us.
- My apologies.
- Okay, apologize to that one.
- I'm sorry.
You took her food.
- Apologize to them,
you took their food.
- I'm sorry.
- This man right here, you
took his food.
-I'm sorry--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You only got to tell
me once.
- But this issue
is cut and dried-- You blew it--
- Okay, that's all I want
to hear.
- and we're pissed
off and we now need to deal with
a situation where we
were starting to build trust.
The trust has been broken,
and it needs to be built
from square one.
We need to start
over now, because right now,
we're all wondering if we can
leave anybody alone.
- If you did that in the army,
you made a bad call in the army,
you'd be kicked
out of there so fast.
- Hell, they'd shoot you.
- They'd shoot you.
- You'd be code red.
- I'd shoot you if I had a gun,
I'd still be shooting.
- No, no, no, no.
A judgment call was made
by one person!
- I wasn't
going to not tell you guys.
- Where's the can
right now?
- I put it up-- I tossed it--
I was walking out--
- Did you hide it?
-No, I was on my way walking
to get some sunscreen,
and I tossed it.
- I didn't ask for beans.
- Was it one
of the big cans of beans?
- I don't know about that.
- You didn't ask for them?
- You didn't ask for food?
- I didn't ask.
He said he was going to open up
because he said,
"I needed to eat."
- That's a lie, dude!
- I don't know if I trust you.
- That's a lie.
- That's not either.
- That's a lie.
- Clarence, that is not.
- Diane, oh, my God.
- Clarence, I didn't ask you
for a can of beans.
- I told you I wasn't hungry.
- Diane, Diane, Diane.
- Yesterday, I did this,
but what is that jive thing
that you were showing
how to do?
Today you shake my way,
man to man when we shake.
Your way ain't the way
I'm going.
- What more do you want me
to say, Tommy?
- Today's a hard day for us.
- We have got to--
- We've got to vote.
- We have to kick one
of us out.
Today was not
a good day to do this.
♪♪
- Come on in, guys.
I want you to grab a torch
and approach the flame.
At Tribal Council, fire
most definitely represents life.
As long as you have fire,
you're still alive.
When your flame is out,
the game is over for you.
So there's fire relating
to ritual,
and then there's
fire relating to real life,
as you guys have
figured out,
living without
it for two nights.
So the good news is, tonight
seven of you
will return
to camp with fire.
Bad news is one of you
is going home.
So before we get
to tonight's first vote,
let's have a little chat.
What's the first thing you're
going to do tonight, Jessie,
when you go back to camp,
having fire?
- I'll definitely light up
a fire and boil water all night.
I don't think any of us is going
to sleep tonight.
We're just going
to boil water and drink.
We're all dehydrated.
Let's talk about
the first challenge.
Diane, obviously, it was
tough on you.
Yeah, it
was tough on me.
We had tried to build a fire all
day in the sun,
and you know, sat out
there in the sun with no water.
And then having to go do this
challenge,
I was done--
I was just out.
I was out of gas.
- Clarence, what's
it been like living together
as a group so far?
It has definitely
been awesome,
despite the fact
that we haven't had water.
Everybody here is really just
gotten to gel
to the point
where even when we mess up,
we feel bad about it.
I know I did some
things today,
and I feel
horrible about it.
And you know, it's just...
you don't feel like that
with strangers.
You feel like that about with
people you seriously care about.
- Fill me in--
What happened today?
- You know, today, a teammate
was not feeling well,
and I decided
to open a can of beans
to make them feel better.
While I had the can open,
I ate some, too.
And that wasn't fair.
Like I said,
it was something stupid,
and I seriously hope they
forgive me for it.
- Ethan, what was your
reaction when you came back?
- I was pretty pissed off.
I'm very impressed that
he stayed behind
and helped out Diane
because she was feeling sick,
and that's very, you know, noble
of a thing to do.
But, you know,
I was a little surprised
that someone would
do that.
- I think he had
a weak flaw in his character.
He had a weak moment.
And I forgive,
but I don't forget.
- All right, let's get to
tonight's vote.
Here's how
it's going to work.
One by one, you're going to
make your way
along here
to the voting confessional,
where you're going to write down
the name of the person
who you're voting
for in clear block letters,
hold it up, speak
your piece.
Diane, you're first.
♪♪
♪♪
- It's Clarence.
You were kind of deceitful
to me today,
plus you
called me a liar,
which I didn't appreciate at
all, since I'm not one.
♪♪
- My vote tonight is Diane.
She's by far the weakest person
on our team right now.
That challenge killed us.
I'm not forgetting about what
Clarence did,
but if you look,
he's a big strong guy
and we need him for the next
little bit
to help us get
some, some challenges won.
♪♪
- Clarence Black.
He let the team down.
We was looking for somebody who
was strong, but yet he is weak.
Our tribe will do what it
takes to win,
but we'll do it
with our head high.
We will not weaken.
♪♪
- Out of all the people who
I hung out with,
you told me
that we were the closest.
And when it came down to it,
I took care of you today
and you lied
on me for no reason.
And for that, I can't
forgive you.
And I'm ashamed to tell
you that the day I told you
you're like my mother, you're
nothing like my mother.
- I'll go
tally the votes.
♪♪
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.
The person voted
out will be asked to leave
the Tribal Council area
immediately.
I'll read the votes.
The first vote...
Clarence.
Diane.
Clarence Black.
Two votes Clarence,
two votes Diane.
Three votes Diane.
Diane-- it's four votes Diane,
two votes Clarence.
Diane-- that's five votes.
That's enough.
Diane, the tribe has spoken.
It's time
for you to go.
See ya.
- Well, a lot has been said
here tonight,
so I would encourage
you, as you head back to camp
and boil a lot of water,
to try and do
some mending as a tribe.
You can take your torches
and head back to camp.
I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

Next time on Survivor...
At Boran, it's boys

We want you on your

At Samburu, lines are
drawn in the sand.
Can Silas be trusted?
- And we're going to take it
all the way, trust me.
- Silas, he's
playing both sides,
but it could backfire
on him.
