HAI:
I have to consider whether
or not I need to take them out,
because this thing
becomes more powerful.
OMAR:
"If both players choose to risk
their vote, then both players
lose their vote
at the next Tribal Council."
Go for the gusto,
and risk the vote.
Did I just do it?
Did I just find an idol?
It's the classic case
of the bunny rabbit
having dinner at the mailbox.

We have skin.
Are we just all potatoes?
There's such grace in the game

CHANELLE:
Daniel has one arm.
He hasn't competed

I am so impressed.
CHANELLE:
Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.
The saga of Chanelle
versus Daniel.
Guess who came out on top.
I did.

Just like I knew it.
Please.
-Chanelle came for his neck.

Tribal was incredible,
but it was also very scary.
You know,
I threw a vote Mike's way--
just in case Daniel
played a Shot in the Dark.
I'm sorry that I had
to write your name down.
It was a game-time decision
where I...
I don't know what
the accomplishment was.
That's what I don't know.
Why my name?
Well, I was gonna tell you,
but you-you keep interrupting.
I just don't understand
the reason
why you would
write my name down.
So I thought that, uh,
you and Dan were teaming up...
-You think I believed
Dan's snow job?
-CHANELLE: Wait, wait. No. Wait.
MIKE:
Chanelle put my name down
for no reason other than
to save her own hide.
Expected? No. Surprise? No.
I gave you my word today.
I said, "I guarantee
you'll be here tonight,"
and you're here.
-I told you that.
-CHANELLE: I thought,
I thought you were playing
-some Jedi mind tricks.
-MIKE: No.
Let's-let's be unified...
We just, we...
MIKE:
I'm not mad.
It's gameplay. It's cool.
-Yeah. We got...

ROCKSROY: Ever since I came back
from my journey,
every time I turn around,
there's Tori bothering me,
trying to find out
what this journey entailed.
TORI:
Did you have fun at all?
-A Survivor experience?
-I did not have fun.
It is not fun.
TORI:
Rocksroy went to the summit,
and he must have found some
type of a clue or something.
Seriously...
No, I believe, I believe you.
I believe you when you say that.
I'm saying, do you know
exactly what it was?
That's what I'm confused about.
ROCKSROY:
Yeah, I know exactly
what it was.
Oh, but you're
just not telling me?
I'm not telling anybody.
I didn't tell,
I didn't tell Romeo
and I'm not telling Drea.
TORI:
Mm-hmm.
He won't give me
any information, and, like,
it doesn't make any sense
to me, and it's...
"Infuriating" is the best word
I could use to describe.
Just so you know, I wouldn't
have thought you were disloyal,
had you taken the advantage.
It's not a disloyalty.
-I don't know...
-But do you see
how that's a little sketchy?
It's clear he doesn't want
to work with me,
so I'm done with him.
Can you just respect
the fact that what I did
-was in the tribe's benefit?
-Sure.
But you don't believe me.
I'm predictable,
and it's good to have someone
that's predictable
a part of your alliance.
Tori is not predictable.
She's not someone that I want
to take far in this game.
If you don't trust me
saying that to you...
I trust
what you're saying is real.
I just want to know
the other information.
ROCKSROY:
So what do you think?
You think I have an advantage?
TORI:
But you're
leaving something out.
DREA:
It's never just, like,
calm with Tori.
Tori can't just, like, chill.
ROCKSROY:
Maybe I gave up something
so that all the four of us
-could move forward.
-Uh-huh.
ROCKSROY:
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
TORI:
I want to know what that is.
That sounds great.
ROCKSROY: But you keep asking,
and I'm not gonna tell.
DREA:
She continues to do things
that start chaos in camp.
That's a big con for me.
You know?
I would just like
to get her out,
but she always somehow slips by.
All right,
this is gonna be a fun day.
So, back in 41,
we did a historic merge twist
where one group
sent one player away,
not knowing
they would have the power to go
back in time and change history.
That player was Erika,
and she did seize the power,
and she changed history
and ended up winning the game.
But what's fun is, we shoot
our seasons back-to-back,
so the S-42 players
have not seen season 41,
which gives us the opportunity
to do the same thing,
only tweak it a bit
to see if we can change
their decision-making process.
So here are the three variables
we're gonna change.
First of all,
the food is from Applebee's.
That's big, that's emotional.
That's home.
That's hard to turn down.
Plus, we're gonna
tell them in advance
that the player
they choose to send away
will have the power
to change the game.
That's huge power.
And then finally--
here they come--
the winning five will determine:
do they want to send somebody
away and give them that power,
or do one of the five want to
give up everything they just won
and keep that power?
It's designed to test
if anybody at this point
in the game will choose power
over the instant gratification
of food
and perceived safety
in the game.
What would you do?
Here we go.
Come on in.

PROBST:
The biggest challenge
of the season.
Everybody put in
a ton of effort,
but the victory went to
Maryanne, Jonathan,
Tori, Hai and Lydia.
So here's what you just earned:
your Buffs, immunity
at that first Tribal Council--
which means
you don't have to compete
in that first
individual immunity challenge--
plus Applebee's.
A very nice afternoon.
Here's a big decision you have
to make before you leave,
as a group.
Lindsay and Rocksroy,
you're gonna determine
their fate.
One of them is gonna join you.
-Oh, wow.
-And for them,
it is as though they won.
They get the Buff,
they get the immunity,
they get the food.
The other will be sent away
to another island and exiled
for two days and two nights,
where they will live alone
with no Buff, no immunity,
no food, no shelter,
no company, nothing.
And to complicate your decision
a little more,
the person you send away
will have the power
to change the game.
So the question
you have to decide,
do you want to send one
of these two away,
knowing they will be
in control of the power,
or do one of the five of you
want to give up everything
you just earned to be sure
you're in charge of the power?
You have two
big decisions to make.
Who do you bring
with you and who goes?
PROBST: Both Lindsay and
Rocksroy will have their game
altered dramatically
by the decision that is made.
Walk me through
the thought process
about who you want
to bring with you, Hai,
because it's a very big
strategic decision
to give this gift to a player.
HAI:
Jeff, it was simple.
One of them looks like
they really need to eat.
That was our reasoning
for the decision today.
I'm sorry, Rocksroy,
but we're bringing Lindsay.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
PROBST: Lindsay joins the five
that now becomes six.
Now, the next
equally big question.
You gonna send him away,
or are one of you
gonna take the spot?
We're sending him.
PROBST:
Okay. Rocksroy, you're gonna
be taken to another island
where you will
live alone for two days,
-two nights.
-TORI: You got it, Rocks.
For the winning six,
there are your Buffs.
Head out for a nice
afternoon of Applebee's.
MIKE:
Congrats, guys. Congrats.
Chanelle, Mike, Romeo,
Omar, Drea.
Normally,
I'd say I got nothing for you,
but after that effort, there
is a small consolation prize--
one serving of rice.
And you'll be heading
to the Vati beach.
That is gonna be
where everybody lives.
Grab your stuff, head out.
Get used to your new home,
and enjoy your rice.
Come on, guys.

PROBST:
So, Rocksroy, what's the feeling
when they had a choice
between you and Lindsay,
but they still sent you away?
ROCKSROY:
Actually, I was
hoping it was Lindsay to go
when you said that the person
that's coming back
would have a little bit more
of an advantage in this game.
Yep, if there is a silver
lining, Rocksroy, it is that.
You will have power
to change the game.
And that's gonna be the question
as you sit out there.
What is the power,
and what will you do with it?
Everything
will be revealed in time.
For now, you got to head out.
Boat will pick you up,
take you to your new home.
See you soon, Jeff.
-PROBST: Good luck.
-All right, buddy.
They said they took Lindsay
because she needed food.
Uh, no, we all need food.
We're all hungry.
So I'm not sure
what the reasoning is.
Maybe Tori sent me out here
to weaken me even more.
But I'm not
disappointed about it
because in Survivor
this is what you want.
You want it to be hard,

just to get a million dollars.

Rocksroy brings home.
Oh. Unless immunity...
Unless Rocksroy changes it.
But everyone votes.
But everyone votes.
Either Chanelle or Tori,
'cause they're separated.
JONATHAN:
Yep.
This first vote is tricky,
because we've been subdivided
into two groups--
people who are safe
safe from the vote
and those that are
vulnerable to go home.
But fortunately, we have some
early low-hanging-fruit targets
for the first few Tribals.
-I'm telling you,
Chanelle is killer at Tribal.
-Yeah.
And she's coming right now.
-OMAR: Okay.
-HAI: Yeah.
OMAR:
We have to make Chanelle feel...
Yeah, 'cause the last time
she came, we split up, so...
-just talk.
-Yeah.
-HAI: Chanelle has proven
that she's not loyal to me,
since my very first Tribal.
And there's only one more person
on my hit list
that betrayed me--
and that's poor Chanelle.
We're talking about, like,
we all have good vibes.
And they all really like you.
DREA:
Yeah.
HAI:
Yeah.
DREA:
Yeah.
-JONATHAN: I'm gonna go check
that spot for spearfishing.
-HAI: Yeah, I'll come with you.
-I'm gonna go get the scuba
gear. You want to come with us?
-I actually want to enjoy
-the beach, too.
You want to enjoy it with me?
-OMAR: I'll enjoy the beach.
CHANELLE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

Let's go get 'em hot.
Get 'em hot. Get 'em hot.

Oh, yeah, buddy.
Jeff!
-Hey!
-Rocksroy!
-Welcome to the pad, buddy.
-What's up?
Wow. You got a shelter.
Yeah, I built a shelter.
I had to rush everything,
but, you know.
This is impressive.
ROCKSROY:
Jeff's coming to visit me, okay?
So I was like, "Wow."
But at the same time,
I'm a little nervous,
'cause there's always some type
of twist and turn in this game.
I'm sorry, I may interrupt you
to take my rice off.
-(chuckles)
-I love it.
So, how are you feeling,
being out here?
I really wanted to experience
what it is to, like,
not only be on Survivor,
but a survivalist.
But I think having
this moment of zen, kind of,
I think it helps me.
So it's like a pause,
-and then the next stage
of the game.
-Exactly.
-So let's recap
where we are, all right?
-Mm-hmm.
Right now we have
the six that are safe.
They got the Buff.
They don't have to compete
-in the immunity challenge.
-Yeah.
You and the other five,
you will have to compete
in that immunity challenge.
One of you will win,
and one of the other five
will go home.
Doesn't have to be that way.
Huh?
Where's that hourglass?
(grunts) The one I've been
trying to figure out
-what the heck it's here for?
-Yeah.
I've been counting it out,
trying to see
if it's a real hour.
-This one.
-That one.
Yeah, set it between us.
So, the sand at the bottom
represents time that has passed.
-Correct.
-History.
Yes.
You can leave things
as they are.
-Right.
-Or you can go back in time...
...and change history,
by reversing the outcome
of the challenge.
They would lose their Buff,
they would lose their immunity.
You six would be safe,
and one of those six
would be voted out.
Whoa.
There are pros and cons
to doing it or not doing it.
I immediately think
of the con of doing it.
There's a huge target on me.
"Why did you do that to us?"
On the other hand,
I have Drea and Romeo
that's already in my alliance.
So those are people
you would be helping.
-And maybe they will
somewhat protect me for a while.
-Mm.
Because at least
I protected them.
It's a big decision.
If you decide to do nothing,
then just do nothing.
If you decide to change history,
at any time between
now and tomorrow morning,
when you return to the game,
find that mallet,
smash that glass.
That's your decision.
ROCKSROY:
This is the biggest moment
in the game so far.
And the decision lies with me.
Awesome.
Wow. Now it's time to play.
I am a honorable player,
but the five that
are currently vulnerable
lost, fair and square.
Hey, not everyone gets a trophy.
You lost--
better luck next time.
But if I leave it
and I don't smash it,
I'm gonna be vulnerable.
The six that are safe
right now--
would they look out for me
and not vote for me?
How much weight does
it carry for me going forward?
And then there's
the Tori factor.
That's the big factor.
Where does she stand?
Tori's a loose cannon,
and right now she's safe.
But with one swing of a hammer,
she's vulnerable.
It's tremendous power.
Ah, it's just a tough decision.
Do I smash the glass
or do I just walk away?
You know, the devil you do
or the devil don't.

how are you?
Two days, two nights. Long time

-Yeah.
-How'd it go?
It was tiring. Had to do
everything by yourself.
Blessed that there was no rain,
um, but it was tough.
It was real tough.
PROBST:
All right.
When you sent Rocksroy away,
you gave him
the power to change the game.
Rocksroy has the power to leave
things exactly as they are.
Whatever happened,
happened.
You six are safe,
you don't have to compete, or...
Rocksroy has the power

I know that.
I respect his choice.
We had a great meal.
You know, I felt good about
being safe, but it's time to...
-it's time to compete.
-PROBST: Tori,
you can hardly
look over this way.
TORI:
Keep in mind we sent you
not just to be exiled
for two days by yourself.
We sent you knowing
that you had power.
So I'm pretty pissed off that
that ended up happening,
because I actually was
doing that to maybe help you.
(laughs softly)
So, Tori, you're saying
that your decision
to not take the power yourself
and give it to Rocksroy
-was a gift to Rocksroy.
-(laughter)
Partially.
I mean, I really,
I know Rocksroy.
I got to live with him
for quite a few days,
and I feel like if he had
the choice between food
or gaining power in this game,
he was gonna choose power.
ROCKSROY: But what can I do?
Tori, you should know that
if I'm sent someplace,
I'm gonna stick with how I feel.
I'm gonna make a decision.

All right.

-Cannot be voted out tonight.
-Yes.
Go ahead and put your Buffs on.
Wow, it smells clean.
All right, let's get to it.
For today's challenge,
you're gonna pull
on a rope
while balancing a wobbly table
and stacking letter blocks.
If at any point
your stack drops,
you have to start over.
First person

from the bottom to the top.
MARYANNE:
I-M-M-U-N-I...
PROBST:
If your stack drops,
you got to start over.
Everybody racing out
with that first letter.
Six people, who, moments ago,
thought they were safe...
...now fighting to be safe.
Jonathan back first.
Has his second block.
He's heading back out.
Everybody else pretty even.
-Good job, everyone.
-PROBST: Couple of different
ways to play this.
You can be very slow
and steady...
...or, if you're behind,
-you may have to get
a little more aggressive.
-Whoa.
PROBST:
But as your stack grows,
that wobbly table
becomes much more important.
Oh, no.
Maryanne dropped...
Oh, Maryanne let everything go.
-(laughs)
-PROBST: I'm not sure why.
MARYANNE:
I dropped one.
I don't want to mess up.
It's easier just to start over.
All right, that makes sense.
Jonathan places
his second block.
Tori places hers.
They're even.
It is Tori and Jonathan
right now.
Here comes Maryanne--
still smiling.
(laughs)
PROBST:
Hai places his second block.
Here comes Lindsay
out with her second.
-Let's go, guys.
-Eight letters total.
-OMAR: Good work.
-Still a lot of challenge left.
Hai places his sixth block.
It is Hai in the lead
right now.
Then Jonathan, then Lindsay,
then Tori, then Lydia
and then Maryanne.
I-M-M-U-N.
PROBST:
Hai is now two blocks away from
winning individual immunity.
Now you're gonna see the
adrenaline start to kick in...
-Ah.
-as Hai gets closer and
closer to closing this out.
Tori trying to get out quickly
with her sixth,
as Hai reaches for his seventh.
Let's go, Hai.
You got this, buddy.
PROBST:
He has two left.
Lydia drops.
Lydia's got to start over.
It's still Hai in the lead.
He's coming out
with his seventh block.
Hai loses everything.
It is now Tori and Jonathan
in the lead, just like that.
Tori now overtaking Jonathan.
Tori places her seventh letter.
She has one left.
Jonathan coming out with his
seventh letter, still wobbling.
-Jonathan drops everything!
-(gasps, groans)
He's out.
It is now Tori in the lead.
Lindsay the only one
that can catch her right now.
Tori heading back for her eighth
and final letter.
Jonathan, frustration.
So close.
You got to keep fighting
because anybody could drop
at any time,
and suddenly,
you're in the lead.
DREA:
Take it easy, guys.
PROBST:
Lindsay places her seventh.
-She's heading back
for her eighth.
-Easy.
PROBST:
Tori slowly reaching
for that eighth.
You have to be very careful.
You don't want to drop here.
Lindsay has
slowly increased her pace,
but it's making a difference.
She is gaining on Tori.
Tori still in the lead.
You got to get all the way out.
Then you got to get
all the way back to win this.
PROBST:
Lindsay is on the platform.
Now she's got to reach
for that eighth block
as Tori reaches
to place her eighth block.
Lindsay has it.
She's heading back out.
-Aw.
-PROBST: Tori has
her final block
and a time advantage.
Lindsay will have
to make up time,
or Tori will have
to make a mistake.
-Aah!
-(gasps)
PROBST:
Lindsay drops everything.
One little hesitation
on that rope,
everything is gone.
Lydia places her sixth.
And... drops everything. Done.
It is now Tori and then
Maryanne, and that's it.
-(Tori groaning)
-PROBST: Maryanne
heading back out
with her seventh block.
Maryanne could be in the lead
if something happened
to Tori's stack.
-Ooh.
-Oh.
-(indistinct murmuring)
PROBST:
Tori with a lot of movement
on that stack,
but it's staying together.
Oh, my God.
PROBST:
Tori is two steps away
from winning this challenge.
All she has to do is
get both feet on that platform
with all of her blocks
-intact.
-Oh.
PROBST:
Maryanne places
her seventh letter.

PROBST:
There's one.

First individual immunity
of the season.
Yeah!
You are safe, cannot be voted
out of this game.
-Oh, my God.
-You will make the final 11.
You will at least be
on the jury.
You're not going home tonight.
Maryanne, Lindsay,
Lydia, Hai, Jonathan,
one of the five of you
will be voted out.
Your dream will come to an end.
Everybody's voting tonight.
But you have one
of five choices.
-Won't be you. Congratulations.
Grab your stuff.
-Thank you.
-Head back to camp.
-MIKE: Yeah, great job, Tori.
PROBST:
See you tonight at Tribal.
LYDIA:
Tori and Chanelle were
in trouble,
and now they are both safe.
So it was basically worst-case
scenario for everybody.
And now we have to completely,
you know, 180
and have
to have a whole different plan,
and it is going to be,
like, every... just chaos.
OMAR: Congrats, Tori.

of the season!
-Thank you.

We haven't put it in yet, man.
We're waiting for you.

-Good to meet you.
I hear you're

ROCKSROY:
I am safe for tonight.
I am safe for now.
Guys that-that
did the challenge,
you know, I feel for you.
I really...
-Yeah.
-I definitely did.
There's literally
no hard feelings from me.
ROCKSROY:
Because I've been away,
I'm gonna have to build
alliances pretty quickly.
Yeah, man, I'm gonna go see
if I can spear something.
Come on, man.
ROCKSROY: But I don't know
what's been happening
in the last two days.
I don't know what alliances
have been made. I have no clue.
Can you get me a boat?
I'll go back to that island
I was on for a couple more days.
Uh, like you, Rocksroy,
I'm-I'm a straight shooter.
I'm straight shooting.
I'm not just saying this 'cause
you're here. You can ask Drea.
She already put you
in this alliance.
-We got eight people.
-Okay.
I mean-I mean,
it would be stupid.
-He's gonna win everything.
-Yeah.
This is our chance. If we don't
do it now, we're dumb.
-ROCKSROY: Shut the front door.
-Yeah, bro.
-ROCKSROY: Oh, baby.
-Oh, my gosh.
-That's right.
-Aah.
ROCKSROY:
He's spitting.
You see, these guys are
doing the guy...
-(guttural groaning)
-I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Already.
I mean, did you not see it?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Get out of here.
I mean, Mike is so far up
Jonathan's ...
-it's disgusting.
-Yeah.
-He's a beast, man.
-TORI: Golden boy.
-Man after my own heart.
-TORI: Yeah. For sure.
He is. He's a man's man.
I love that.
-You know how I am.
-TORI: Yeah.
-ROMEO:
He sleeps next to him.
-TORI: Yeah.
ROMEO:
He... They wake up--
"Let's go see the sunset."
-Get out here.
-The energy.
Did someone give you food?
-Oh, my gosh.
-No, I'm just, like, honestly,
this is sort of...
-Yeah. They're...
-This is the second part
of Survivor.
-Yeah.
-And this is where
Romeo comes out.
-Oh, come on. Yes. Yes.
-You know... you know who I am.
-You know who I am.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
ROMEO:
I was terrified
because I didn't have a Buff.
Now it's like
I have power again,
and I just feel like
a different person.
I'm power hungry,
I want control again, and
I want Jonathan gone.
Here's the thing. If it's not
him, it's gonna be you.
-I know. I know.
-They're not gonna vote
for one of the girls.
I know that physicality
is the merge boot. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
MARYANNE: I really don't want
to vote for Jonathan,
but the thing is,
options are limited.
It's, like, my butt
is on the line, too,
and I'm talking
and I'm strategizing
and I'm scrambling, 'cause,
like, there's only five people
not safe for this Tribal--
Jonathan,
Hai, me, Lindsay and Lydia.
Jonathan is going to be
a very physical threat,
I think, going forward.
-He's terrible
with puzzles, though.
-Is he really?
And he's super helpful
-with having food.
-Which is fine, yeah.
-And, like, all of that.
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, I'm-I'm open.
-Yeah. For sure.
-Yeah, me, too.
-But, like, Maryanne--
she's all over the place.
-Yes.
LINDSAY:
Like, she's going crazy
in her head,
so many different things,
and she's super strategic.
-Jonathan's not as strategic.
-Yeah.
-For sure.
Do you think she has anything
other than the Shot in the Dark?
-Yeah?
-(Lydia gasps)
LINDSAY: My biggest pitch
is Maryanne-- that she has
a lot of hidden ammo.
And I don't want to pitch Hai
because I want
to work with Hai.
Secondly, Hai told me that him
and Lydia were gonna go
for rocks for each other.
So the only option left
is Maryanne.
-Good chat.
-We can talk later. Yeah.
-Yeah.
LINDSAY:
I need people
to be more fearful
of the power that she has versus
a potential threat of me
or Jonathan,
'cause that's what it seems
like it's coming down to.
-No.
-No. Did it for you?
CHANELLE:
I see right through it.
Lindsay's put her pitch out
to protect herself and Jonathan.
He catches food,
and people are mesmerized
by the "golden boy"
kind of thing.
He's not golden to me.
Like, he could go on streak,
and that's always scary.
-Because, you know?
-CHANELLE: Yup.
CHANELLE:
Kind of seems like a no-brainer.
-Yeah, I'm definitely down
with that. Like, it's not...
-Mm-hmm.
You guys can do what you want,
'cause, like, I have no...
-I'm safe, and I have no vote.
-No, it's fine.
-So, ultimately, it's your game.
-Mm-hmm.
OMAR: My first instinct,
knowing that I'm safe
and I don't have a vote,
is to just shut the heck up
and not say anything.
Because why?
Why would I jeopardize
my position in the game?
But the more I thought about it,
I'm like, "This is terrible."
Omar, this is the time
that I need your help.
I know. That's why
I'm hustling for you.
-Help me.
-I am. I am.
JONATHAN:
I'm obviously
the biggest threat out here
when it comes to physical,
and if I were them,
I would vote me out.
But I'm gonna keep
fighting in this game
'till I'm dead.
I'm voting for Maryanne,
and, uh,
stick with me.
I promise, I'm loyal.
Well, if someone has to go,
then it's gonna be Maryanne.
Here's the problem, though.
The fact
that I have
to put my trust in people
that I met a day
and a half ago is very scary.
But we're supposed to be
an alliance of eight, and, uh,
I am confident in Omar
keeping people off my back.
Yes. Yes.
Um...
But I did speak to Lindsay,
and she was saying, like,
-Maryanne is, like,
a huge liability.
-Oh.
So, it's, like, it's really
what does your gut say--
-Jonathan versus Maryanne?
-(sighs)
It feels like you're swayed
Jonathan over Maryanne.
I just want to do majority.
There is eight of us that want
to all work together, but
there is just this point
where I'm, like, "I just
want to go with the numbers."
I don't want to be the one
on the bottom.
And I kind of feel like
we could be good.
We could be good,
but this game changes so fast,
so, actually, who knows?
I'm so worried. Like,
you can't prepare for anything.
Okay.
-Yeah.
-(laughs)
OMAR:
Lydia says to me,
"Like, I'm really torn."
And I'm like,
"This is opportunity."
Like, you're telling me
you don't know if you want
to stick with the eight.
And that's my opening to say,
"Sacrifice little Lydia."
Thing is, now I feel
it's between Lydia and Maryanne.
-Positive?
-And then I think
it's going to be something.
While it will be Jonathan
and not you.
I feel like you and Lindsay were
really on the Maryanne train,
-which I-I see, long-term.
-Mm-hmm.
But right now, it's too early,
and she's useful to us.
OMAR:
I'm trying to bring Taku
back together because,
at this point,
Maryanne has an extra vote
and a hidden immunity idol,
and I don't want either one
of those things
going out of the game
because I'm gonna need weapons,
I'm gonna need arsenal,
and I'm gonna need an army.
You were the primary at first,
but I'm trying
to shift it to Lydia.
-Why was I the primary?
-I don't know.
There's rumors
that you have an idol,
so I think
other tribes know about it.
-Okay, just be chill, okay?
I need you to be chill.
-Okay. Yup.
-Because if you blow it...
-It's gone.
I'm shifting things to Lydia.
Okay,
so I write down Lydia's name?
At Tribal, you need
to write down "Lydia."
And if I'm not successful...
That's fine.
My jaw just dropped.
I was like, "Why me?"
Like, I don't want to go out
before the merge.
I've worked so hard
to be here, and
I'm so terrified. All I want
to do is cry and scream.
But, like,
I know that in this game,
I have to go, and I have
to center myself,
and I have to stay calm.
I feel as if me playing my idol
right now--
it all comes down to Omar.
The plan is obvious.
We need to switch to Lydia.
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.
Yeah?
OMAR:
In this game,
you take a little bit
of information, and that's
where you weave in your own lies
or your own truths
to prime them of the fact
that Lydia's maybe not
on their side, long-term.
But Lydia right now is Hai's
number-one ally in the game.
This is one of
the toughest jobs I've had
out here since I've started.
I didn't want
to upset the eight
-before it got to the point.
-Right. Right.
-So I didn't think
it was my place to say it yet.
-Right.
OMAR:
But Lydia is like,
"At some point
within the eight, we need
to go after the bigger players."
I think Jonathan--
it's too early for him, but now,
it's, like,
Maryanne's the only one,
-and she has an immunity idol.
-Yup.
If she plays that,
it's one of the eight.
So, Lydia is the choice here.
♪ ♪
But I want to make sure
all three of us are
-on board for the plan.
-MIKE: Hai,
if that's what you think,
I'm with you.
HAI:
Not an option at all.
Lydia and I have been day ones
out here, and I gave her
my word
that I would protect her.
So now I have to
scramble and get her
the numbers to stay.
Okay, and now I need to get
enough votes for Maryanne.
It's Jonathan and Maryanne.
Tonight's tricky.
There seems to be
a group who wants to target
the more physical players,
such as Jonathan.
which I don't like,
'cause I consider myself
one of the more physical
people here.
I want to win more
individual immunities, okay?
And I feel like
you would stand in my way.
HAI:
Which is why I need Maryanne
to go home tonight.
However, the issue is,
we know for a fact
that Maryanne has an idol.
Exactly, so we might be...
we might just slip by.
HAI:
In Survivor,
your relationships
take precedent,
and Lydia going home
will only hurt my game.
This game is wild.
Moments like these
are where good players
fold, and great players
prevail.

Wow. Everybody here.
-First time.
-It's a good-looking bunch,
huh?
It really is. I was just kind of
taking everybody in, yeah.
-And we love you, Mr. Jeff.
-(laughter)
-PROBST: Mr. Jeff. Yeah,
I'm getting used to that.
-Yeah.
(laughter)
PROBST:
All right. Hai,
how do you feel about this?
Is this
-a defining vote tonight?
-It is a defining vote,
but things are a lot more fluid
this season.
Tribal lines are typically
with your starting tribe.
However, this season,
it's very fluid,
it's always moving,
and everyone's in conversation.
OMAR:
Everyone said,
"Let's go get firewood,"
but that firewood is empty.
LINDSAY:
I noticed that.
(laughter)
PROBST:
So Romeo, what do you base
trust on at this point
when you don't know
a lot of these people?
I don't know about them, but for
me, it's always a gut feeling.
How are they interacting
with me?
Do they want
to start a conversation?
Or are they just starting
a nonsense conversation
just to say
that they talked to me?
I can look at somebody
in the eye
and know if they're telling me
the truth or not.
Simple. That's just a gift
I've had since I was a child.
PROBST:
Drea, it's interesting.
Romeo gave
a very specific situation
of somebody coming up and just
starting a BS conversation.
-Right.
-Do you feel like
you can pick up those cues?
DREA:
I'm very good at that,
but maybe
someone didn't come
to talk to you
because they didn't feel
comfortable coming to talk
to you or something like that.
So, I see both sides.
PROBST:
Hai, that's a very
sophisticated approach.
You cannot just wait.
Sometimes you have to stick
your hand out and say,
"Want to talk?"
Yeah, it's the idea of,
are you a driver
or are you a passenger?
You know, for me, growing up,
I didn't have a lot
of confidence,
and I knew coming out here,
I didn't want to be
that version of myself.
I wanted to come out here
and play with confidence
because if you come out here
and you play a fearful game,
you're not gonna get anywhere.
PROBST:
Lydia, I really connected
-with which version
of yourself you want to show.
-Yeah.
When I was in high school,
we moved from Wichita, Kansas
to Seattle, Washington,
when I'm in the middle
of high school.
And I decided I'm going to put
a different version of myself
out in this new high school.
Have you had any of that
yourself
out here in terms
of what parts
of me am I gonna put out
and what parts am I gonna hide?
LYDIA:
Yeah. Growing up,
I-I faked a lot of confidence,
you know.
And leaving my hometown
and just, like,
gaining independence and just
accepting parts of myself
that I never even realized.
You know, it... the confidence
actually became real.
And in Survivor specifically,
you're going
to just play better
and you're gonna feel better
if you are just
your full authentic self.
PROBST:
Jonathan, one of the things
you have to do in this game is
hide your paranoia or your fear.
You know, the "never let 'em
see you sweat" thing.
Does paranoia get to you?
There's a point in the game
where you've done
all that you can do.
And whoever
gets kicked out of here,
I hope that they go,
"I did everything I could do.
"When I had the opportunity
to be on Survivor,
I left it here."
PROBST:
Omar, that would be
the best way to approach
every Tribal Council.
-Yeah.
-Can you do that?
Uh, my younger self would not
have been able to do that.
I think my older self--
now that I'm 30...
-(laughter)
-PROBST: Wow.
Let me just
take that statement in
-for a moment.
-Yeah. He don't know old, man.
-Oh, that hurt.
-OMAR: I would say now
that I've had some
life experience, you can just
look at it factually, and
you know that at some point,
somebody's gonna come for you.
So I feel like
I can just tell people, like,
I'm worried,
and not dwell on it.
PROBST:
Rocksroy,
-you came into this late.
-Yes.
PROBST:
Could you sense a direction
of why the vote
might be going the way
it's gonna go?
ROCKSROY:
Yeah, it's a tough one because
I'm coming in this
two days of not being here.
But one of the things I know
that I can rely on is
the bond that I've built
with my alliance.
And then there's a part of me,
also, that feels pretty bad
because it's, like, my decision
is ultimately is the reason why
one of these people
are going home tonight.
PROBST:
Maryanne, what do you
think the theme
of the vote is tonight?
MARYANNE:
Who can I continue
to work with and
who do I want to work with
for a long span of time?
PROBST:
Drea, you agree with that?
-No, I don't agree with that.
-Okay, that's fine.
'Cause tomorrow,
someone could be gunning for me,
and then I might have to depend
on someone else to save me.
So, yeah, it's always changing.
But you choose your vote
because you think
that person's going
to work with you.
But if they change their mind,
then of course,
you're not going
to work with them.
So then, I feel as if
we're on the same page,
different part of the line.
-Yeah?
-So you agree with me?
-And you agree with me?
-No, I agree that
this doesn't mean that
this could take you long-term.
-It's Survivor. Yeah.
-Exactly. We're on the same
page, I think.
Not really. Agree to disagree.
-And I respect that.
-PROBST: So Maryanne,
for all the charm,
do you worry talking too much
or debating too much
could be a reason
where the group just says,
"You know what?
"I just... I need
to get some sleep.
Let's just vote Maryanne out"?
Obviously,
I do worry about that.
But the thing about Survivor
is I can show
my true self, and, like,
that means not be subdued.
That means that, like,
if I have a weird thing
which I want to say,
I want to say it. Like,
I wanted people
to know me for who I am.
Like, everyone in this tribe
has great qualities,
and everyone
in this tribe has things
that they want to work on.
Some of these things
might be obvious
to everybody,
some of these things might be
less obvious to everybody.
Mine are obviously more obvious
to everyone, 'cause I'm just
like a "Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah." But, like,
I knew that coming into the...
What was your question?
(laughter)
(insect whirring)
-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
-DREA: What is that?
MARYANNE:
It's, like, a beetle
or something.
-Or a rat.
-It's just a beetle.
-He's on me.
-Big-ass beetle.
-Look. He's right here.
-No! Aah! Ooh!
-TORI: Oh, my God.
-ROCKSROY: We're in
his neighborhood.
MARYANNE:
No, I know. It's all good.
It's all good. I'm fine with it.
Oh, you actually
do have one there.
-Yeah, he literally does.
It's there.
-Oh, that's cool.
-MARYANNE: Exactly.
-ROCKSROY: Just a beetle.
PROBST:
So Chanelle, are you
better off on Survivor
to try to quiet your quirks?
Or, as Maryanne is,
just embrace who you are?
CHANELLE:
That's what this game
is supposed
to bring out of you--
the fullest version
of yourself
where you are meeting
your highest potential.
And if you're not authentic,
people will
see right through that.
HAI:
Jeff, there are
12 realities here,
and each one of us have
a different perception
of every single other person.
So even if you think
someone's telling you the truth,
it could be a lie, so,
lies will be revealed tonight.

I got blindsided

it sucks, for sure, but as much
as I wanted to make it further,
I learned a lot about myself,

meaningful experience.
