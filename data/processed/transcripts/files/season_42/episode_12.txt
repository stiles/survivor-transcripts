 --- 

        Welcome to
the finale of Survivor 42.
I love finale nights,
and I think tonight
is gonna be very exciting
and very unpredictable
because there are still
so many ways it could play out
and so many players who have
a legit shot to win.
There are only
two weapons left in the game--
Mike and Maryanne
both have idols.
They both have to play
them with five players left,
which means, in theory,
they both get to four.
Which means, in theory,
they're at least making fire--








which means at least one
of them is in the final three.
So for the other players,
it will come down
to immunity challenges,
because, without the necklace,
you are left to rely
on your ability
to persuade other players
that what you want
is what they need.
And that is very tough
to do on Survivor,
because both can't be true.
There's only one winner.
So tonight we're gonna have
two immunity challenges,
two Tribal Councils,
one fire-making showdown,
and then we will read the votes
here in beautiful Fiji
and go right into the aftershow
and talk about everything,
while the players are still raw
and hungry and dirty.








Take a look at this final five.
That's a final five.
You have Mike, Jonathan,
Romeo, Lindsay and Maryanne.
Three of them are gonna get
to the end to get a chance
to plead their case
about why they deserve
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars
that goes along with it.
Here we go.
This is
the finale of Survivor 42.

LINDSAY:
Savagery is what's
gonna happen right now.
Don't get in my way.
I'm balls to the wall,
going all out.
MIKE:
I've never given up on anything.
On anything I've done,
I've gone extra.
And that's what I'm doing
right now.
I'm fighting
to the bitter end.
MARYANNE:
I want to show that I'm here
to play my game
and I'm here to win.
I can close the deal and
be the winner of Survivor 42.
ROMEO:
In the end, I will be wearing
the Survivor tiara on my head,
and I will be
the ultimate Mr. Survivor.
JONATHAN:
There's nothing
that's gonna stop me.
At the end of the day,
everyone will know
that Jonathan gave
everything that he had.

There's gonna be
a battle royale.
MIKE:
This is a big game.
I have to be a big player.
LINDSAY:
My goal is to win Survivor.

ROMEO:
I don't want to be
second or third,

ROMEO:
After Omar was voted out,
everybody was
just smiling and laughing.
Everyone's just happy
we've made it to the final five.
And then we come to find out
that we are now
at a brand-new beach.
MIKE:
Holy crap. I don't know
where we are, but this is it.
This is our home.
There's all our clothes.
Well, at least
we got a machete and a pot.
This is bizarre.
Is there more to look at?
I think this is it, guys.
LINDSAY:
We don't even have our tarp.
We're back at scratch.
Yeah.
Good news is,
we have only three days.
MARYANNE:
This new beach has nothing.
We don't have a tarp,
we don't have a shelter,
but you know what?
I was on cloud nine
because, by voting out Omar,
now everybody on the jury knows
Maryanne is here to play.
I might actually have a chance
to make it to the end
and win this thing.
And I haven't felt like that
this whole game.
It's all coming together.
ROMEO:
Listen,
I have no hard feelings,
but I just want to know,
what did Omar tell you
to convince you to vote for me?
I never talked to Omar.
You weren't the plan.
Well, you voted for me.
I know, but I want
to hear what made you
-pick Omar first.
-JONATHAN: So that's why...
Yeah, we-we, uh, we planned Omar
for a little bit.
Okay, and I'm your--
I'm in your alliance,
and I was unaware of that.
You voted for me, Lindsay.
LINDSAY:
But you already backed up
on your alliance,
because I'm supposed to be
aligned with you. And you...
So was Omar.
-You just... Well, you backed...
-You voted for me.
LINDSAY:
I'm so pissed.
Now I have to deal with
the stupid wrath of Jonathan
being all righteous of like,
"You voted for me.
You are the one
who are in the wrong."
Like, dude, screw you.
If you're telling me Omar
was the plan the whole time,
and I'm in your alliance,
you didn't tell me that.
That means you lied to me, too.
I think I've been
getting played this whole time.
No. You voted for me, Lindsay.
You're forgetting.
LINDSAY:
I can't stand
how he talks to me.
I'm frustrated
that I have to kiss his ass
and grovel,
just for the sake of getting
through the next few days.
And just this cockiness
that he now has
just drives me
up a frickin' wall.
I voted for you because
Omar pinned me against you.
But if I,
but if I knew the truth,
I wouldn't have...
(groans)
He's impossible
to talk to.
He's just so frickin' righteous,
and it drives me insane.
ROMEO:
Well, since we're all
being honest here,
I have an idol, and I'm using it
in the next Tribal,
so at least I get to final four.
If you guys want to vote me out
after, that's fine.
Good for you, man.
Good for you.
You're playing your game.
ROMEO:
I'm here
by the skin of my teeth.
They should just name me
"The In-Case Survivor,"
because every time there's
a plan to vote somebody off,
somebody's always gonna
throw votes on Romeo.
Just in case that person plays
an idol, Romeo goes home.
So I thought the only way
that I can survive
the next Tribal Council
is to come up with this lie,
which is to say that I have
a hidden immunity idol.
Yeah.
They seem to buy it,
but just to be sure,
I made a fake idol.
And, uh, I came up
with this little baby.
See?
I think I did pretty good.
I suck at arts and crafts,
so my second grade teacher
would be very proud of me.
And, uh, hopefully it'll get me
through another Tribal Council.
♪ ♪
MIKE:
Yeah.
JONATHAN:
Mm-hmm.
I want you.
I literally want you to win.
And, like,
Mike gave me his word.
He said, "If I'm here at five,
I'll give you the idol."
It will be
a two-three-two vote on Omar.
-MIKE: Then he's out.
-Yeah.
-Here's my promise to you,
my giveback.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-MIKE: I'm the only one
with an idol left.
-Yeah.
-I will either give it to you
if you want it...
-Yeah.
MIKE:
...or play it for you.
-I got your back.
-Yeah.
-I give you my word,
you'll be in the final four.
-Okay.
LINDSAY:
I'm in the worst position
I could possibly be in.
Romeo claims he has an idol.
Mike has an idol, and he's
never gonna turn on Jonathan.
And they're obviously gonna take
Maryanne to the end over me.
So if I don't win immunity
today,
I'm definitely going home.
MIKE:
I don't know about that.
Yeah, but you're not
gonna play that for me.
I know that every...
everyone wants me out.
Mike is saying that he might
play his idol for me,
but he told Maryanne he would
give her the idol at five.
So I'm like, "Don't lie to me."
I appreciate that.
Please don't.
I'm not. Look at me.
I'm not.
Listen, it's okay. Come here.
(Lindsay sniffles)
My vote's Romeo.
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.
I'm not.
I'm trying to stay positive,
but if something doesn't happen,
I feel like I'm screwed.

One for you, Lindsay.
One for you, Mike.
We get tree mail today, knowing
that it's a final five immunity,
but we also get a little
envelope that's saying
"Final Advantage Clue."
And we're all like... (gasps)
"First you must
unscramble the words,
"then decipher the phrase.
"You cannot search
for the advantage until
you have correctly solved and

where to find an advantage.

A sleeping giant. Tree's giant.
Sleeping means it fell.

We need to figure that one out.
MARYANNE:
Lindsay scrambled
and she runs away.
But then Mike's like,
"Hey, yeah, guys,
let's all work together."
And I'm like, "Ugh!"
Like, I'm like,
"I guess I have to sandbag it,"
because I don't want
these guys to go

I want Lindsay
to find the advantage,

Once you have all the pieces,
you're gonna use them

about stuff, too,
and it means nothing.
LINDSAY:
Today was a challenge
that I absolutely needed to win.
So now the only possible way
that I'm going
to get through this is to
vote for Jonathan--
all three of us--
and hope that Mike
gives his idol
to either myself or Maryanne.
He gave me his word that he
would play his idol for me.
Did he give you the same word?
He kind of said it to me
on the beach that he might.
He didn't guarantee it.
MARYANNE:
I really, truly do think
Jonathan won't be here tomorrow.
I have faith.
LINDSAY:
Maryanne is
extremely confident that
Mike is going
to play his immunity idol
for her,
but I can't rely on that.
So my plan is to pitch
to Mike hard
to make him feel
extremely guilty
that he'd be breaking his word
if he didn't pick me.
(birds singing)
LINDSAY:
So, I'm just begging
to not go home.
I valued how much
that you feel like your word,
as long as someone shows trust
back, you show trust to them.
I feel like I very much
earned that with the trust
that I've given you.
We had a bond--
you, me, and Omar--
we're going
to make it to the end.
Omar burned you,
but I stayed true to my word,
and you saying to me,
"I would love to see you get
-to the end."
-That's still true.
-But you have the power of that.
-I know. Yeah.
So if I leave,
then it makes me feel
that that was a lie.
It's not a lie.
I still feel that way.
Honestly, I love Lindsay.
I think she's a great girl.
I really do.
I see my own daughter in her.
I think she got caught up
in the wrong place
and with the wrong person.
Other than that,
she's been loyal to me.
But on the other hand, it's fair
that I protect Jonathan
'cause he protected me,
and Maryanne has been a person
of good character.
She's kept her word,
and that means a lot to me.
I'm gonna tell you my dilemma.
When that happened with Omar
-and-and you, I thought...
-Mm-hmm.
MIKE:
...I went to Maryanne
and made a promise to her.
Then this is what's hard
for me, Mike,
because I feel like
I've proven myself to you
in so many ways, and now,
because you now made
a last-minute promise
to Maryanne, everything
that I did meant ....
No, that's not true.
Mike, look at me in my eyes.
I 100% never lied to you once.
I promise you, I swear
-on everything.
-I believe you. Yeah.
I had your back
and told you everything.
And this is your time
to-to show me the trust back.
I'm very torn. I...
Honestly,
I don't have my-my mind made up.
I've put myself
in a position where
I have to make a decision
that's going to
hurt somebody,
and it sucks.
I'm not 100% any way right now.
But now I got to figure out
what's the right thing to do.
Right, he's got to... You know
what, though? You're right.
But listen.
I... Like, my mind says, like,
I think I can squeeze it out.
Right now
Lindsay is a sitting duck, but
not only do I have my idol,
which is
the only secret that has been
kept in this entire game,
but also Mike might give
his idol to me at Tribal.
So this means that my idol--
I can use it to save Lindsay
and blindside Jonathan.
The question is,
what gives me
my best chance of winning?
Emotionally, yes.
MARYANNE:
Lindsay's played
such a great game.
She's won immunities
and taken major risks,
and the jury loves that.
But voting out someone
who knows they're going home--
that's not a big move.
MARYANNE:
But if I play my idol
on Lindsay
and blindside Jonathan,
the jury will know
that I am here to play
and that I'm a contender.
But it all comes down
to what Mike does,
and this could make
or break my game.
♪ ♪
PROBST:
Let's start this morning.
Lindsay, you wake up,
and you each have a riddle
to solve.
Walk me through what happened.
LINDSAY:
We each get this envelope
that says,
you have
to fix the word scramble.
Once you figure that out,
you're off to the races
to solve the riddle
and find a secret advantage.
And I was the only one
-who solved the riddle.
-(chuckles)
-I-I had to have been gone
for at least 40 minutes.
-At least.
PROBST:
Jonathan, it's got
to be frustrating
because it's an advantage.
It's offering you something
in the game
if you can just solve it.
Yeah, that's the thing.
I haven't felt normal
in days, Mr. Jeff,
because of how hard
this has been.
It took four people.
-Yeah.
-No, we didn't get it.
-And we still didn't get it.
No, Lindsay had
to come back and tell us.
Yeah. We said... we said,
"Lindsay, can you tell us
what it was?" She's like,
"Well, yeah, I got it now."
-It was "sleeping."
-It was "sleeping."
It was "sleeping."
It was "sleeping."
We look at the word.
We said, "We can't believe
it was 'sleeping.'"
PROBST:
So, Lindsay, you get
the advantage, but did you feel,
going into the challenge,
that that advantage
would be helpful?
Absolutely. I knew
if I didn't win, I'm going home.
And I was one puzzle piece short
from beating Mike.
Super happy for Mike.
Really proud of him
that he got it.
Just sucks
that in return of that,
I'm most likely going home.
So what's giving you
that feeling?
LINDSAY:
Based on last Tribal.
Everyone else,
apparently, already kind of knew
that Omar was working everybody.
I didn't until afterwards.
And then there was a lot
of damage control to do,
and some that wasn't able
to be repaired, it seems.
Jonathan, then,
what was the vibe at camp?
I thought it would be fireworks
with people running around
everywhere. Was it not?
Is everybody locked in
that it's Lindsay?
Uh, you can never know
for sure,
of course, because then
comfort sets in,
and we know that
that kills people in this game.
But people do recognize Lindsay
as a big threat, which she is.
Maryanne, what was your take
on what was going down at camp?
MARYANNE:
In my perspective,
I had to decide
on whether I wanted
to vote emotionally
on who I feel
I want it to be in the end,
and strategically on who
I feel is the best combination
of people to have in the end.
And everyone here knows that
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
so that was something that
was difficult for me because
I love every single person here,
and I...
but I need to go and recognize
that, like,
I want to play this game for me,
and that means
that I might have
to, like, go back on my word,
or, like, that means
that I might have to go back
on an alliance, and that sucks.
PROBST:
So, Lindsay, do you feel
that you were the only one that
was openly feeling desperate?
-Yes.
-So that was clear to everybody?
Yeah, so it's calm
because no one has
to really make a decision.
It was more me having
to plead my case of why
I would like to stay.
I mean, on one end,
I got deceived by Omar
this entire time,
so my social game clearly sucks,
strategic game sucks, because
all I have
is my competitive edge.
That's only one...
That's one note.
So, in terms of fighting
against the jury,
that's not really a big case.
That's only one end of that.
JONATHAN:
No, absolutely not.
Every time Lindsay
communicates with people,
they have a bond with her.
It's not just
because you got tricked
that makes you
a bad social player at all.
You're social with everyone,
and everyone loves you.
And that's the truth.
PROBST:
And so, Lindsay,
this is a question
I can never figure out
what I would do.
How do you stop trying?
Because I'm sure, at some point,
you go, "Well, okay, I guess
that's it. But wait, Mike,
let me just... Can I...? Let me
just try it one more time."
-Is that what happened?
-That's literally what I did.
-That's exactly what happened.
-LINDSAY: Yes.
-Okay.
I'm doing it right now. Like,
I have to just pitch my case
as best as I can.
Until you snuff that torch
and my name is up there,
I have to just hope
that I can just say one
last thing and offer one last...
I don't know. I-I don't know.
It's like guns blazing,
whatever I have left.
I'm just throwing anything
out there.
PROBST:
Jonathan, how do you feel about
that aspect of the game
in this sense?
The better player you are,
the more likely
you are to be taken out.
In theory, in a lot of games,
the better player you are,
the more likely you are to win
'cause you're better.
It's a fine line. If you aren't
a great player, then
people want
to keep you till the end, but
if you're looked at
as too strong, then done.
MIKE:
Or finding the person
or people
that you really can trust,
and they... you work together
to get to the end,
even if you're a good player,
that helps out.
But again, it is Survivor.
That changes quickly.
PROBST:
And what does that mean?
That you can be a good player,
and if you find
another good player
that you trust,
then maybe the two of you bond
and you protect each other?
Yeah. You don't even have
to be two good players.
Just two people that really know
that they have
each other's back.
As long as one of them
doesn't feel
the other one has an upper hand,
you kind of work together.
I mean,
but it's a hard thing to find.
Well, Maryanne, the key is,
you have to align with people
that you believe you can beat,
and the trick is,
they're aligning with you
because they believe
they can beat you.
Exactly, and so many people have
tried to play that fine line
and played it a little too well.
That's truly why I think
Omar is there, because he...
I thought I was his number one,
but then
I realized that if I did take
my number one to the end,
I'd be taken
and herded as a goat.
But you have to realize,
"Okay, no. I have
"to go, and I now have
to find new allies
"who are round the same level
as me
so I actually have a chance
to win at the end."
PROBST:
So, Romeo, if you were gonna
give this vote a title,
this chapter is called what?
What's the vote about?
I would call it "The Fighter."
Whoever it is didn't give up.
They kept fighting till the
very end, and that's admirable.
So, Lindsay,
you think he's talking to you?
It's "Lindsay: The Fighter"?
Yeah, but I-I like that title.
I'm cool with it.
If-if the reason
for me leaving is because
no one thinks they can beat me,
that's the best way
for me to leave.
All right, well, it sounds
like it is time to vote.
Romeo, you're up.

I can hear you breathing just
walking up the steps, Maryanne.
Oh, yeah.
MIKE:
Good morning, Jeff.
Good morning, Mr. Jeff.
Good morning.
Oh, wow.
PROBST:
It is a Survivor classic.
-You know the name?
-Yes, sir.
All right, so,
let me just check in.
How are you doing, day 25?
Mike, what are you feeling?
Obviously we're very depleted.
It's day 25.
But I always say,
"Big games, big players."
And that's when you reach deeper
than you've ever reached
into everything you have
and put it out there,
and this is
the last immunity challenge.
And whatever's left in the tank,
you have to leave right here
on this platform today.
PROBST:
How about you, Romeo?
When you're about
to take on this challenge,
who all do you think of?
Do you draw
on inspiration right now?
Definitely. Family back home.
All the strong, independent
women that I coach back home.
They're looking at me
and saying, "Hang in there.
You know, you taught me
to push for what you want."
And now I'm showing them that
I'm pushing for what I want.
I want final three.
How about you, Jonathan?
What do you draw on right now?
We've been working this hard
for this moment, Mr. Jeff.
And for me
it comes down to this.
And everything that I have, I'm
going to pour it into this game,
and I'm going to give it my all
so that if I do get kicked off,
then I'll say,
"Hey, I fought the good fight.
I did everything I could do."
Maryanne, right now
you've been so vocal all season
of sharing your emotions.
You even say,
"I wear 'em on my sleeve."
What are you feeling right now?
What are you drawing on
to get you pumped up?
(voice breaking):
Um... right now...
I'm sorry. (sniffles)
I'm right now
drawing on knowing that
my whole family's going to be
watching me doing this, and...
one of my family members
is not talking
to the rest of my family,
so we haven't really
been together
for more than a year,
and it hurts.
But to know that at this moment,
even if they're separate,
we're together right now,
cheering me on
is the thing that's driving me
and pushing me.
PROBST:
So you being on Survivor
could bring your family back?
(crying)
I want it more
than a million dollars, Jeff.
(sniffles)
I want it more
than a million dollars.
(sniffles)
PROBST:
How do you now take that emotion
and turn it into energy
rather than sorrow or sadness?
I sit in the sorrow and sadness.
It's okay to feel sad,
but the thing is,
sadness doesn't take you
anywhere.
It's what you do with that.
What am I going to do
with my sadness?
I'm going to turn it
into passion and drive
so that I push myself,
and I do the best that I can,
and I win this competition.
PROBST:
All right,
all four of you feel very ready.
You know what's driving you.
Let's get to it.
First things first, Mike.
Jeff, you might have to wrestle
me for this. I don't know.
-Ah, I don't want
to wrestle you, man.
-Ah.
-I want love.
-You always get love, brother.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
(whistles)
It comes down to this, Mr. Jeff.
-PROBST: It comes down to this.
-Man, I'm stoked!
Come on!
For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.
For today's challenge,
you're going
to have one hand tied
behind your back.
You're going
to drop a ball down the chute.
It's going to spiral around.
You're going to catch it.
You're going to drop it again.
At regular intervals,
we will add another ball,
making it more difficult.
If at any point a ball drops,
you're out.
Last person left standing
wins immunity,
guaranteed a spot
at the final three
where you will get a shot
to plead your case to the jury
that you helped vote out,
why you deserve
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars.
Plus, you decide,
"Who do I take with me
to put in that second seat, and
who do I force to make fire?"
All the power will be
in the hands
of the person
who wins this challenge.
Never has a challenge been
more important
in this season
than this one right here.
Are you ready?
-MIKE: Yes.
-Yes, sir.
-PROBST: Let's get to it.
MIKE:
Yes.
All right, everybody pick up
your first ball.
Here we go. Final four.
Win this, you're in three.
Everybody,
drop your first ball.
This challenge is on.
Everything riding right here
on this beautifully-designed,
hypnotic game.
What started
as an art department project
in Survivor: China by somebody
who had some free time
on his hands, named Simo,
turned into a challenge
that we used
in Survivor: Tocantins,
and is now worth
a million dollars to somebody.
Right now you're just getting
warmed up,
getting a feel of this.
Mike drops.
Mike, you're out.
Mike is out with one ball.
Unbelievable.
Never seen that happen.
Mike has no control tonight.
-I'm still in shock.
What happened?
-MIKE: So am I.
Took my eye off of it
to put it in.
I mean,
we're in the warmup phase.
I literally had it in my hand.
It slipped out of my hand.
All right, we're down to three.
In a moment you're going
to add a second ball,
and that's when this challenge
will really start to kick in.
You'll have 15 seconds to do it.
You don't need to rush.
You just saw, with Mike,
how quickly it can be over.
Stay engaged.
Your 15 seconds starts now.
Maryanne drops.
Jonathan drops.
Romeo drops.
Everybody now
with two balls in motion.
The key to this challenge
is that gate.
It's going to send one ball
to the right,
and then the next ball
to the left.
It's going to come down
to the spacing.
(clicking)
That sound is hypnotic.
You got to stay very engaged.
Mike still stunned.
You never know what is going
to get you on Survivor.
-(Maryanne groans)
-Oh, Maryanne drops.
Maryanne is out, and now,
quickly, we are down to two.
And we only have two balls
in play.
It speaks to mental exhaustion.
This is not a difficult phase
of this challenge.
Lots of kids watching
could do this.
But they've been sleeping
and eating.
Mike and Maryanne--
their fate will be decided
by either Jonathan or Romeo.
Whoever wins this challenge
will hold
all the power tonight
at Tribal Council.
You're gonna get ready
to place a third ball.
You'll have 15 seconds
starting now.
Based on what's happened so far,
three balls might be it.
Romeo drops.
Jonathan drops, and we're now
into the next phase--
three balls.
Those balls now feel like
they're spinning more quickly.
That spacing is really critical.
Every part of you is focused
on one thing--
left, then right.
Left, then right.
This is it.
Who will have the power tonight
to try to control what happens?
Romeo and Jonathan,
if you hear a thud
of that ball hitting the plank,
that's going to echo
in your mind for a lifetime
if you lose Survivor.
All right, in a moment, we're
going to add a fourth ball,
and it's going
to get very difficult.
So you need to start thinking
about where you want
to put that fourth ball.
You'll have 15 seconds
to do it
starting now.
You can drop any time
in that window.
Romeo drops.
Jonathan drops.
Jonathan drops, and he's out.
Can't make the transition.
Romeo wins
his first individual immunity,
-and it could not have come
at a bigger time.
-(clapping)
Romeo is in charge
of everything tonight.
-MARYANNE: Congratulations.
-Wow. What a challenge.
-On any given day...
-I'm proud of you. Great job.
...anybody can win anything.
You have the inspiration
in your heart.
-(Romeo sighs)
-Romeo, what is it right now?
-I want to know right now.
-(Romeo sniffles)
I feel like I've been at the
bottom of this game for so long,
and I've just been hanging on
by my fingernails.
Every Tribal, my name comes up.
Every single Tribal,
Romeo was always the "in case."
In case somebody pulls an idol,
throw some votes on Romeo.
It's just... it's exhausting.
I've been fighting so hard,
and this feels good.
And I'm going to go back home,
and to all those young women
that I work with
and tell them, "That's what
I tried to teach you.
"Just-just don't give up
because, hey,
you could be in the final three
of Survivor."
This is a dream come true.
Let me come to you.
-Yeah!
-Great job.
-Jeff.
-Final four immunity.
You are not only safe.
Every decision that happens
tonight will be yours.
All right, everybody, grab
your stuff, head back to camp.
I will see you tonight
for the biggest Tribal
-of the season. Congrats.
-Thank you.
-MARYANNE: See you, Jeff.
-MIKE: Great job, man. Hey.
ROMEO: It was
extremely emotional for me
because I felt like, after
winning this, for the first time
in a long time, I had security.
ROMEO:
This is definitely
my Miss America moment. The
spotlight's going to be on me.
I have the shiniest dress.
I have the most expensive dress
and the most coveted dress, so
we'll see what I do tonight.

-JONATHAN: Good job, Romeo.
-MIKE: Good job, Romeo.
Way to come through
when it counted, brother.
Thank you, guys.
Coming back from the challenge,
I felt like
MVP, Miss Universe
and prom queen all combined.
I beat Jonathan in the final
immunity challenge.
I am just thrilled,
and I think this necklace looks
a lot better on me
than it does
on big-ass Jonathan.
(laughs)
All good.
This big victory going into
one of the most important
Tribal Councils--
it's just kind of like vengeance
for all those horrible Tribals
where people just dismissed me
and-and just threw my name
out there just in case.
So it feels amazing,
and I'm enjoying it.
Oh, Romeo, unless you have
your mind made up, and you want
-to say something,
I'd like to talk to you first.
-Sure.
-Hey, I'll talk to everybody...
-Has nothing to do with...
It has nothing to do
with strategy.
It's about my personal feeling.
Romeo has to send me
to make fire because
it's the consensus
that I'm the most dangerous.
It's a compliment and a curse.
It is what it is.
I think I can beat Maryanne.
Jonathan could be
a different story, though.
I'm in deep water,
but I didn't drown yet.
I know you're gonna have
to ask me to make fire.
I want you to know
that there's no animosity.
If I'm being 100% honest,
I know I'm the right move.
You'd be silly not to send me.
-That's why I know
it's going to happen.
-I respect that a lot.
You need to think
about the other two.
-If I go against Jonathan...
-ROMEO: Yeah.
...and I beat Jonathan,
then you have to deal
with me and Maryanne.
-That's true.
-But if you make me make fire
against Maryanne
instead of Jonathan,
-you only got to deal
with one of us.
-Yeah.
I do have to send Mike
to make fire,
but he has a good point.
If he goes against Jonathan
and he beats Jonathan,
now I'm going to be going
against the two most likable
people in the final three--
Mike and Maryanne.
You need to make a bold move.
That's up to you.
-Listen, I'm giving you advice.
I'm just telling you...
-Yeah.
-that's how
I would think about it.
-Yeah.
I'm weighing everything
at this point
because what good would it do
for me
to get to the top three
and end up
third place or second place?
I want to win.
Jonathan, are you ready?
-Yes.
-Go.
Oh, that's a good amount.
-Oh, nice. Whoa!
-Hold on.
MARYANNE: Jonathan is
very good at making fire,
and my fire-making, I would say,
is decent, but the thing is,
you never know what's going
to happen at Tribal.
Maybe I'm going to choke.
Maybe Mike is like,
"I'm a super good fire maker."
So, the best thing
for me is for Romeo
to put Jonathan and Mike
for fire,
and Jonathan wins.
You're good.
You just have to focus on, like,
building a fast teepee up,
'cause the trick is
to get the sticks to catch.
-They're caught. Mm-hmm.
-Once the sticks catch,
you've won.
-So the sticks are caught.
Do you see that?
-Then you're good.
I've been telling Jonathan
all the tips
and tricks to go
and make fire because
I don't want Mike here
in the final three with me.
I want Jonathan and Romeo
because that is my best shot
at winning.
-So, what was that?
Like, 30 seconds?
-Yeah, that was, like,
surprisingly fast.
Jon, do you want
to go talk, my brother?
-Yeah, I do.
-Look at you practicing, huh?
You don't need practice.
I need practice now.
The first thing you do to
prepare for a night like tonight
is you start a lot of fires.
So I've been starting
a lot of fires.
And I've been
starting 'em quick,
but no one has seen Mike
make a fire.
I'm gonna try like hell to beat
your ass tonight in fire.
-You better, man.
If you don't...
-Hey...
-If you don't,
I would be ashamed.
-I get one last...
I got...
I got one last little bit in me.
-I hope... I hope you try.
-Oh, I'm definitely gonna try.
I ain't giving it to you.
If you want it,
you got to take it off me.
Be honest. You start fires
a lot, don't you?
-I don't know.
-Ah, yes, you do.
-Ah.
-I think that you've been
dealing with fire too long
for you not
to be a good fire-starter.
I'll tell you what, though.
If Romeo gives you an out
not to make fire,
take it.
-Yeah?
-Yes.
Don't lose your spot.
I'm telling you.
-Yeah.
-Listen, you'll be the favorite,
definitely, to beat me,
but don't risk your spot
for that, man.
-I'm telling you right now.
-Yeah.
I know Mike's plan,
and I know what he's doing.
He's trying to get in my head.
I'm being serious.
If he gives you the out,
take it.
JONATHAN:
Mike, that's not going to work
for me, buddy.
I love you,
but you can't get in my head.
You're just going
to get me hyped to beat you.
ROMEO:
This is exactly what I wanted.
We need him, like, spooked.
He's practicing right now.
He doesn't know if he's going
against his buddy or you,
-and I want to keep it that way.
-MARYANNE: Okay.
(rapid scraping)
MARYANNE:
I can't sit down and relax
and be comfortable.
I have to be prepared to make
fire, because, in the end,
Romeo has all the power.
He might blindside me,
and I might have
to make fire against Mike.
'Cause the trick is,
you just want to get
the tiny sticks to ignite
'cause once you have
those tiny sticks ignited...
-Yeah.
-...it's game over.
MIKE:
For 21 years,
I've been watching Survivor.
I always had one dream
in my life.
The last thing that I would
want to put on the top
of my résumé of life-- and
I have a pretty good résumé--
it would be to win Survivor.
So tonight,
whether I have to make fire
against Maryanne or Jonathan,
there's only one choice--
for me to win.
My fate is in my own hands,
and I truly feel that if I win
at making fire tonight,
I will win a million dollars.
So,
this is for me to lose.
♪ ♪
All right, let's talk
about the past couple of days.
If you start yesterday morning,
you had a riddle.
Lindsay solves it.
She gets an advantage
in the immunity challenge.
Turns out, the time advantage
was enough, in theory,
to have won.
But Mike ends up winning,
the guy that some would say,
least likely to win
on a complicated puzzle.
-You said it many times.
-Absolutely.
We get to Tribal Council.
Lindsay can't persuade you
to keep her
because she's too big a threat.
She's now on the jury.
We get to today. Romeo,
a lot of people would have said,
if you're gonna look
at past history,
you're the long shot to win.
And then you win.
And what it reminded me
is that so much of what
we accomplish in life starts
with showing up,
and by showing up,
you're still in the game,
and you have
all the power tonight.
So, as you sit here,
what is that feeling of knowing,
"I hung in there long enough,
and when I needed to,
I did what I had to do"?
ROMEO:
I mean, I work with all types
of people back home,
and I encourage them to be
the very best that they can be.
And somehow, in this game,
for the first time,
I had to use that advice
that I give them on myself.
No matter how low I'm feeling,
I still had to keep pushing.
It's just a reminder that
if you just hang on long enough,
it can happen.
And that's why
I was so emotional today
because I did it,
and I'm very proud of myself.
PROBST:
All right, before we get
to your decision,
let me check in
with everybody else. Maryanne,
-how you feeling?
-You know, you always feel like
you're going to vomit
'cause it's like,
I've watched the show and,
like, I've seen people be like,
yeah, they do fire at camp,
and they get here,
and they can't do... They can't
even catch a flame, right?
So, like, even, like, how
confident I feel, it's like
anything can happen
at Tribal, so...
PROBST:
Did you practice making fire?
MARYANNE:
Yes, I did.
Jonathan, how are you feeling
about your fire-making skills?
I'm pretty good at making fires,
Mr. Jeff.
PROBST:
Mike, what was your take
on the afternoon?
Well, the worst
kept secret at camp was
I'm definitely making fire
tonight.
I mean, it's
obviously ironic a bit
that the fireman
would be making fire,
but it doesn't mean
you know how to make them
just because you have
a living of putting them out.
MIKE:
Very true.
I watched Jonathan make fire
for the last 12 to 13 days.
He's very good at it.
I will give it my best shot.
So you feel like it's you and
Jonathan. That's what I heard.
And that's exactly
what I'm saying.
-I feel like
it's me and Jonathan.
-(chuckles)
They're putting their best
fire maker against me.
PROBST:
So you're the target?
(scoffs)
Absolutely.
PROBST:
All right,
well, let's find out.
So, Romeo, before you tell me,
just walk me through
the different things
you considered and why.
Yeah, I mean, I felt
like Miss Universe,
and this was my crown, and
everybody wanted to talk to me.
It felt great, uh,
but it's not as easy
as-as they think it is.
It was like
a tennis match in my head.
Am I making the right choice?
I don't know.
I might be making a million-
dollar mistake, or not.
I-I don't know, but I've played
my game since day one
based on my gut feeling,
and I'm still here.
So obviously
I did something right.
And, uh, I'm going
with my gut tonight.
Okay. So, congratulations.
First spot at the final three
is yours.
You will get a chance to
plead your case tomorrow night
to this jury.
The next decision is
who's going to be sitting
next to you
in that second spot
at the final three.
Who's that gonna be?
Ah.
I'm taking Maryanne with me.
And these two are making fire.
PROBST:
All right, so, Maryanne,
you are now in the final three.
-(exhales deeply)
-PROBST: You, too, will get
a chance to plead your case

Both guys get some coconut husk

That magnesium is what's
gonna give you that igniter.

not a pushover.

Your work is not done.
Your last job is to
claim your victory,

accountable for your actions

for your final Tribal Council.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much. Thank you...
-Thanks, Jeff.

I got to tell you,
I was so shocked

my main man Mike
started that fire.
He beat me fair and square.

No. Come on.
I know.
To be successful tonight,
I need to go and be honest

There's no getting out,
which means,
when I go down, I have to

Wow. Here we are.
Final Tribal Council.
Romeo, Maryanne, Mike.
There are stages to Survivor.
You have the beginning, where
you need to form a strong tribe.
Then you have
the individual game.
And then, when
you get down to about five,
you have that final push,
and tonight is the last phase:
claim your victory.
This is it.
You have to convince
this group of people
that you voted out--
you're the reason
they're over there--
you deserve
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars
that goes with it.

All right, it's time
for our final
Tribal Council Q and A
from the jury.
We're gonna examine the game
tonight
from three different areas:
social, physical, strategic.
And I realize that they often
overlap, and that's okay.
All right. Who wants
to get us started? Omar.
All right.
It's been so long since
we've been able to talk to you,
so I wanted to congratulate
all three of you.
And this season
has been so unpredictable.
And it's so fitting
that you three,
who may be perceived
as three unexpected players,
are the ones that made it here.
And similar to Darwin's theory
of natural selection
and survival of the fittest,
it's not always
the mighty elephant
or the powerful lion
that's gonna win.
Sometimes it's the honeybee,
which causes prosperity
in agriculture
across the world,
or even the cockroach,
-who survives
this apocalyptic game...
-(laughter)
that we've had in season 42.
So, for tonight,
what we really want you
to do is present
your survival of the fittest
strategy
and make us sure that
you deserve to win,
because all our votes
are open tonight for any of you.
-So fight for your life tonight.
-That's right.
All right,
let's start with social.
Okay, so, Mike,
my perception of you,
from the outside looking in, is
that you're a man of integrity,
you're a man of honor,
your word means something,
-you really value a handshake.
-Yeah.
It appears that you do not want
to lie or deceive in this game.
Maryanne, my perception of you
is that you're bubbly, young,
you're talkative,
you're silly and goofy.
Sometimes you might
take parts of the game
less seriously than others,
is how it appears.
And, Romeo,
my perception of you is,
there are times when
you are quiet, more reserved,
you know, scattered with bouts
of frantic paranoia
and random votes at Tribal.
So my question, to all of you,
with that perception, is,
is that accurate?
Is that accurate of how you
played the game, who you are?
And if not, what am I missing?
Was there more to it?
-Mike.
-I think it's a great question.
Um, I think you described me
pretty well.
Um, I think I've absolutely
played the game
as honorable
as I could play a game
that is about deception,
about backstabbing.
There was only one time
I went against my word,
and that was to Rocksroy, and
I owe him an apology for that,
but I think
I've played the game true
to how I wanted
to play the game.
Maryanne.
So, I agree with almost
all of your perception with me.
The only part
which I don't agree with
was when you said that I don't
really take the game seriously.
So, me not taking the game
seriously
was actually
a part of my strategy.
When I came into the merge, I
realized that there was a trend.
If you were young,
like under 25, and you seemed
like you were strategic,
you would be voted out.
Zach got voted out-- under 25.
Swati got voted out-- under 25.
Lydia got voted out-- under 25.
Tori, you were under 25.
You showed that
you were strategic,
and you were on the bottom
for the whole time.
So I basically had to pretend
that I had no strategy,
and then,
when there were fewer people,
I'd be able
to start to show my strategy
further and further in the game.
Romeo.
So, the only negative word
that you said about me
was, uh, "paranoid."
And, at a certain point, I was,
because, when we got
to the merge of Kula Kula,
I quickly went from
feeling like I was the boss
to the employee.
And I was at the bottom
of every single Tribal Council.
And the random votes,
yes, I did do that,
but that was purposely,
because I didn't want to vote
for the person that was going.
Chanelle, I knew you were going.
I didn't vote for you.
Tori, I'm glad that
I didn't have to vote.
Hai, you saved me,
and I told you I wasn't gonna
vote for you when you went,
and I voted for Jonathan. Um...
But your strategy of throwing
hinky votes to rile people up,
you did that to me,
it succeeded,
and you proceeded
to gaslight me.
So, was that part
of your social game?
ROMEO:
No, I did not gaslight you.
You saved me, and
I didn't want to vote for you.
-I refused to vote for you.
-HAI: Let me, let me specify.
The gaslighting was
when I asked you
if you threw the hinky vote
at me at the Chanelle vote-off.
And you said, "No, I did not."
Yes.
So you did gaslight me.
ROMEO:
For that time, yes,
because you came at me
aggressively.
HAI:
But you came at me aggressively,
too.
I was just-- I let my feelings
get to me.
And it-it came from Drea,
'cause I felt Drea
replaced me with you.
You were so good
that you... that you were...
that she replaced me,
and I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Thank you for owning that.
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.
You admitting that
me getting close to Drea
-made you threatened,
I respect that.
-ROMEO: Yeah. Yeah.
So thank you for being truthful.
PROBST:
Anyone else, social?
Uh, yeah, um, Mike,
you touted a lot around camp
about honesty, integrity,
you're a man of your word.
-Yes.
-And you said earlier,
is that the only time
you've ever lied in the game
was to Rocksroy.
But did you not lie to Drea
on the beach
about going after Romeo
to make her feel comfortable?
And you said, "Omar,
we got to vote out Drea.
-You know I'm just trying
to make her comfortable, right?"
-(Drea chuckles)
MIKE:
Well, I never purposely
sacrificed my integrity,
but there were times
that I had to do things
that maybe I didn't want to do.
I had to protect myself.
That's honor for myself, also.
Mike, I don't think
I hear you owning up
-to what we're asking you.
-MIKE: Okay.
CHANELLE:
And so, I just want to kind of
-really dig in.
-Okay.
How many people in this game
did you shake their hands,
did you look in their eyes,
did you give your word,
and then did
you lie to their faces?
MIKE:
I'm gonna be honest,
there's only one person
that I shook their hand
and said something,
and that was Rocksroy.
Everybody else,
I absolutely kept my word,
and, until, no, no,
until they deceived me first.
And I'll explain what happened.
Rocksroy says to me,
I say to him,
"Is this easy as it is?"
We shook hands.
I said, "I'm voting Romeo."
At the last minute,
you came up to me and said,
"Listen, we have
to vote Rocksroy off."
I said,
"I can't vote Rocksroy off.
I just told him
I wasn't voting him off."
And you said, "No, we have to."
I said, "If we're in an alliance
and I'm your number one,
"how come I didn't know
until 30 minutes prior
to us going to a Tribal?"
You shook my hand,
and you blindsided me.
-I was never deceitful.
Your words are...
-MIKE: Yes, but then, okay.
So you're telling me
that you weren't deceitful?
-Then-then I...
-I think somebody else
might have lied to you.
You don't realize that Omar was
lying to you the entire time?
-MIKE: But then you weren't
talking to me.
-HAI: Yes, I was, Mike.
I didn't even know you were
in an alliance with them.
I told you.
It kind of comes down to,
anybody who's aligned with you
is not allowed
to talk to other people...
-Mm.
-...when that's how people
get information
to be able to give you,
yet you are allowed
to talk to lots of different
people and have one-on-ones.
And that's where
it seems inconsistent.
-MIKE: That's true.
-HAI: But was that the strategy?
We're trying to understand,
was that strategy,
-or was that just like...?
-MIKE: It was.
It was absolutely strategy
to use
my social game for the alliance
I was in and for myself
-to advance in the game.
-JONATHAN: Okay,
but you just claimed
that your game was to be honest
and have dignity.
That is not what
it's sounding like, Mike.
-You need to own your game.
-Well... I am,
I'm saying it right now.
I just want to,
I just want us to settle down
because we all lied to people.
Mike, I actually think
your social game was on point.
You were very social
with everyone.
And kudos to you,
as a 57-year-old,
staying in the talks
with all of us--
people who are half your age
most of the time.
Thank you. Fortunately my social
game is what I am in real life.
I'm a very social person.
I like people.
I want to know
what makes them tick.
And you guys
opened up your world to me,
introducing me to places,
cultures,
religions that I never knew
before, and I just ate it up.
So when I talk to people,
people like me,
and they would just come up
to me and give me information.
I-I respect that,
'cause your social game
is the reason I went home,
straight up.
Like, it saved you.
Thank you.
-I have a question for you,
Maryanne.
-Mm-hmm.
OMAR:
At Taku,
I felt that your social game
put you on the bottom.
Did you realize
that your sloppy social game
was putting you in danger,
and did you do anything to
change that later in the game?
Yep. And I can understand that,
and thank you
for pointing it out
and giving me the chance
to explain my social game.
To be completely honest,
I didn't realize that
my social game was as sloppy
as I thought it was
until the fake merge.
I truly was sitting there,
being like, "Wow,
I'm doing such a great job.
-I'm living such a great life."
-(chuckles)
And, like,
I'm gonna be honest about that.
Like, I feel
as if that's because
when I got comfortable,
I started to play
a little bit more emotionally.
When I play emotionally,
I'm someone where I love
to tell everyone everything.
And you literally
can't do that on Survivor.
Does that answer your question?
-Yeah.
-I want to piggyback
off of that.
-Mm-hmm.
-LINDSAY: Was there
any particular people
that you were
able to draw in yourself
for a vote,
or just for an alliance?
The person who I feel
I specifically went
and drew in for a vote
was Romeo at your vote, Omar,
because Romeo and I were kind of
working back and forth together,
and you two were very gung ho
already about voting Omar out.
-So it was time
to take out Omar. But the...
-Hold on.
-That's not...
That's not how you knew.
-Yeah.
-I told Mike to team up
with you to take Omar out.
-Yeah.
This wasn't a move
that you came up with.
Yes, you two did go
and think of it first,
but I can tell you and promise
that I was
already thinking about it.
I was deciding whether
I'd take him out at six or five,
and I will agree that Mike and
you talking to me is what said,
"Okay, it needs to be at six."
LINDSAY:
Okay.
So I want to hear
the same thing from Romeo.
What is a big social move
that you did, Romeo?
So, for me, I'm more
of a one-on-one conversation,
as opposed to
sitting around camp
and just speaking out loud
in front of groups.
That's not what I do.
Back home,
I work with women one-on-one,
and that's what I did with each
and every one of you,
I felt like, whether I was
in alliance with you or not,
I had a relationship.
So, to answer your question,
that was my social move--
making alliances
with every single person.
-Okay. Got it.
-Like I made with you.
Like I made
with Omar and Maryanne.
Like I made with Drea and Rocks.
Like I made
with every single person.
PROBST:
All right, I'm gonna move this
into the physical part
of the game.
-Rocksroy, I can't think of
a Survivor in recent memory...
-(laughs)
-...who's enjoyed the physical
part of the game as much as you.
-Yeah, buddy.
-Yeah.
-So why don't you get us started
in this section?
Uh, one of the things I noticed
is, uh, for a lot of players
this year, is just basic skills.
Doing physical work,
building a shelter,
identifying plants or whatever.
What skills did you guys think
you brought to the game?
Maryanne?
So, one of the things which
I did was weave palm fronds.
So, when we were all still gung
ho about weaving palm fronds,
I showed most of my tribe,
"Hey, this is how we weave it."
And I also used it
for other things.
I made Omar's prayer mat.
This is just an example
to show that
I weave palm fronds.
Another thing
which I knew how to do
was, I was very, very good
at scaling and gutting fish.
My family were-were Luo--
which is a tribe from Kenya--
and we love eating tilapia.
So when you buy it in, like,
little buckets of it,
you have to individually
scale them and gut them.
So I've always been growing up,
watching my mom doing this.
So, even though
I can't catch a fish,
I can go and be like, "Thank you
for bringing this fish.
I'm going to prepare it so
you don't have to do that work."
Mike.
MIKE:
Um, I think
the most important thing,
in regards to strength,
is my work ethic.
I didn't stop moving once
in the 26 days I was out here.
Every single time something
was needed to be done,
even if I didn't know
how to do it. I cut bamboo.
I went and got wood. I built.
You are the only reason
we had a merge shelter.
It was incredible
to watch you work
-the first two weeks of Vati.
-And I got to be
honest with you,
I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.
(laughs) It was fantastic,
and you did it so fast.
-Yeah. It was a nice shelter.
-Yeah.
-Thank you.
-ROCKSROY: Romeo.
So I'm gonna
be honest with everyone.
I've never been camping
a day in my life.
I just learned how to swim
to come out on Survivor.
-I-I was just...
-LINDSAY: That was
very impressive
considering
you just learned how to swim.
-I thought you did
really, really well.
-ROMEO: I was, I was not...
Number one,
I'm terrified of heights.
And I just learned how to swim.
And now I have to do both,
and on national TV,
in my underwear.
-So, I'm like...
-(laughter)
And you hate hearing Jeff say,
"Romeo dead last."
-(laughter)
-And-- but-but
that last challenge,
I knew I was gonna win.
I didn't care what it was.
I was like,
"I'm not leaving Survivor
without my dream
of wearing that necklace."
And I pulled it through, and I,
and I was so proud of myself.
And I think that was the most
important immunity challenge,
'cause it gave me power.
And it felt good
to have power in this game,
so it meant the world to me.
All right,
let's move into strategy.
So, my vote, just so you know,
is off of game strategy--
how you played this game.
So I want to know
what your biggest move
that you did on your own,
in this game, was.
Um, Romeo.
For me, my game
quickly shifted into,
unfortunately,
a self-preservation game,
'cause my name
was always at the bottom.
I had to make as many alliances
as I could,
and hopefully
that would push me through,
and that did.
But somebody's just gonna say,
"Okay, well,
we'll take Romeo,
'cause we could beat him."
So I figure,
"Okay, I need to do something."
And the first thing was
create a fake immunity idol.
Whether it worked or didn't,
that was just to get people's
attention away from me,
to not vote for me.
Then the last and final
immunity challenge,
I knew I had to win,
to show that nobody carried me
to the final three.
I put myself there.
Why did you take Maryanne
to three?
Mm. Good question.
ROMEO:
I felt that she didn't
have a strategy,
and my best move was
to bring somebody that was
perceived
to be playing a similar game.
And I secured my own fate
by putting myself
in the final three, and-and...
and the rest is up to you guys.
Mike, what's something that
you solely did on your own?
MIKE:
Once we got to the merge,
I decided to make my big move.
And I thought
Hai was too strong.
I was nervous
that he was coming at me.
And I organized
a blindside on Hai.
And that's when
I started working
with, uh, Lindsay and Omar
to better my game
strategically.
Do you think you played
an emotionally-charged game,
or do you think
you played a strategic game?
I think I played both.
I think I played
a strategic game,
but I also think I played
an emotional game, too.
Sometimes my emotion
got the best of me.
Um...
I'm-I'm being told
that I gave my word,
and I, and I went
against it a lot.
Well, if I'm being honest
with you,
maybe I didn't play as much
with integrity as I thought
I did, to be honest with you.
And I, maybe I misconstrued
exactly what I was doing.
But again, you have to say
some stuff that is not true,
or else you're
gonna get steamrolled.
You're gonna be voted out.
I would have
been out a long time ago
if I didn't do what I did--
I know I would have.
So at seven on, I realized I'm
playing the game of Survivor.
I used the beginning
of the game to set up that game,
and then, from seven down,
I played the game
that I thought that would
best get me to the end.
Maryanne, I'm really,
really interested
in what you have to say,
'cause we slept together
by the fire every night,
and I don't know what
you really did in the game.
My one big move
that I did was set myself up
to be in the final three,
with multiple combinations
with Omar's vote.
Let me explain to you why.
When I voted out Omar,
Mike gave me his word
that he will give me
his idol at the final five,
and that would
guarantee me the final four.
But then, you know,
you might be like,
"Mike backed on his word.
So, like, how were you so sure?"
And the reason is, I kept
the only secret in this game.
I, actually, after your vote,
Tori, had the merge idol.
-I can show it to you right now.
-(gasping, oohing)
MARYANNE:
And I told no one about it.
You can see it over here.
Here's the idol.
Here's the note.
So now we're then
off to my final four
of Jonathan, Mike, me and Romeo.
So that meant that if I won,
I'm going to the end,
because I'm not making fire.
If Mike won, he gave me his word
that I would go to the end.
If Romeo won,
Romeo was afraid of Mike,
he would take me to the end.
And if Jonathan won,
he would want to go
and have that final big move
to take Mike out,
and Romeo and I
would be at the end.
By taking you out, Omar,
I gave myself the best position
to be sitting here.
♪ ♪
Touché.
CHANELLE:
I have a question.
What's your story
of your personal evolution
playing this game?
Like, what did you learn
about yourself?
Romeo, I'd like you to start.
Um, I felt like,
for at least
the second part of this game,
I was holding on
by the skin of my teeth.
And back home I would say,
"Screw it. Let me just
try something else."
But out here,
I couldn't do that
because I was not just
representing me.
(sniffling)
(crying):
That was not the game
I wanted to play.
I didn't want to play
from the bottom,
but that was the game
that was dealt to me.
And I-I-I... and I saw
an opening and a window
for these two people
that were going to play with me.
And then, the next vote,
these three people want
to play with me.
And then this person was gone,
so then
I had to find another person,
and I just kept going
until I won that final immunity,
and that's what I'm going
to take away from this game,
is, no matter
how hard this game was--
and I can tell this
to the girls
that I work with,
empowering back home--
I didn't give up.
I didn't give up.
I'm leaving this game
as a free man
who will no longer have to hide
because I'm scared
of what people might think--
even my religious family
back home--
just because I'm gay,
and they won't accept me.
I'm going to... I'm going
to leave this game as a free man
to live my life the way I wanted
to live since I was 19.
And it took me
in my 30s to figure it out.
And just a quick shout-out
to you
for making me comfortable
to do that.
-DREA: Thank you.
-CHANELLE: Thank you. Mike?
MIKE:
So, for me, I think
that I proved that
people that are older,
like myself
and Rocksroy, can come out here,
compete in the game,
play the game hard,
and get along
with the younger generation,
which sometimes is not so easy.
For myself, I-I learned that
I can still do what I thought
I couldn't do anymore.
You know, I-I-I talked a lot
about my kids, and it just...
For my kids
to see me come out here
and do what I did
and... and-and compete
and-and... and succeed
to a certain level,
that they would see
that they can do anything
that they've put their mind
to it,
and that there was no...
There's no boundaries
as to what they can accomplish
in their life.
So that's what I learned
about myself.
-Maryanne?
-MARYANNE: So,
the thing which I really learned
about myself is that,
a lot of times we talk about
how Survivor breaks you down,
how it takes your insecurities.
And I realized, I,
with the Omar vote,
made my path to the end.
But there was a chance that
I was going to lose the game
and not know why.
So then I started
to self-sabotage myself.
I really wanted
to bring Lindsay to the end,
but in my mind, I'm like,
"I cannot beat Lindsay."
'Cause that means
that I wanted to go
and give myself an easy out
(crying):
because I didn't want
to feel that rejection
of friendship.
Even recently in my life,
a couple years ago,
someone spread a rumor about me,
and I lost so many friends,
and I didn't want
to feel that again.
I kind of knew
that that's how I self-sabotage.
Like, when I was young,
I used to push people away
so they couldn't go
and hurt me first.
And it's like,
to know that I'd do it
in something that I love, too,
it's like, it shows
that I still need
to grow as a person,
and I'm still growing,
which is why, like,
I'm still proud of myself.
Because I really,
really was so, so close
to playing my idol for you,
like, before we went to Tribal.
But I'm like, "Maryanne,
you need to grow and you need
to make yourself open." Like,
I knew that I still had
to take that chance to lose
because I deserve
that chance to win.
Thank you.
Thank you for your transparency.
PROBST:
Jury, I have to say,
one of the best
final Tribals
that I can remember.
You held them accountable, but
you were always respectful
and at times
even encouraging
and inspiring them
to try to give a better answer.
And, Romeo, Maryanne and Mike,
you did a great job.
It's very hard to sit over there
and take that from them,
-but that is what you want.
-Very hard.
You want the opportunity
for them to grill you,
and I think all three of you
held yourself in really
high regard. You should be
very proud of yourselves.
-We're going to take a moment.
-Thank you guys.
We're going
to let the jury take in
everything they've just heard.

All right, so, we are still
in the jungles of Fiji.
We've just crowned our winner,
23-year-old
Maryanne,
who just won Survivor 42.
-Oh, my gosh.
-MIKE: Yes.
PROBST:
One of the younger winners
in our 42 seasons.
Let's start with you.
What is this feeling right now?
Because one of the things
I want to ask the jury.
I think they came in undecided.
I think you swayed them tonight.
Did you feel that happening?
At first, I felt as if
I wasn't being asked questions,
and that's so demoralizing
'cause you're like,
"Oh, they either know my story
and that's a good thing,
or they don't want to know my
story, and that's a good thing."
But honestly I knew that,
like, the pivotal moment
would be telling about my idol
and that final six,
about how I really set myself
in the end.
'Cause I knew that, like,
compared to other people
who were on the jury,
I didn't really
play a big strategic game,
and I had to prove,
it's like, I was here to play,
I'm not just
here to get to the end
and experience it.
I wanted
to experience everything.
And it's like, to be
the 40th winner
of the show is...
Like, I still can't believe
this is happening.
Clarifying because
two people have won twice. Yeah.
Yes, two. Yes.
Tony and Sandra. Sorry.
PROBST:
Let me just see a show of hands.
Who here came in undecided?
Okay, so virtually everybody.
Hai, when you say
you were undecided,
were you swayed by Maryanne,
or were you just leaning one way
or the other?
Yeah, I don't want my, uh...
my shirt to throw you off,
but I was undecided,
mostly because we didn't
-work together for a large part
of the game.
-Mm-hmm.
And we all came in
wanting to know your strategy
because it was pretty elusive
to a lot of us.
Same with Romeo. I think Mike's
was a little bit more visible.
But for us, we wanted
to give you an opportunity
-to explain yourself.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-And you did it so eloquently.
-Thank you.
So, Drea, with so many people
coming in undecided,
what do you think happened?
Because it was a seven-one vote.
The other two votes were
Maryanne's, as well.
Right. I think, um,
and I know it came off
as if I was coming off hard,
but we knew that Mike
had been playing the game
since day one.
So I really wanted
to give her the hard questions
so she could explain herself
in detail.
Was there anybody
who was leaning toward Mike
-that got swayed by Maryanne?
-Me.
PROBST:
Really? So, wow.
Rocksroy, Tori, Lindsay,
a little bit Omar,
and Drea were all leaning Mike.
Omar, was it that Mike faltered
at the end,
-or did Maryanne step up?
-For me, it was two factors.
One is that Mike played
a more obviously strategic game.
And, you know, what I was really
looking for Mike was, "Yeah,
"I played the honor,
I played the integrity card,
but I was playing
to win the whole time."
And I didn't feel
like I got that.
Whereas Maryanne-- I was really
tight with her from the start,
and her strategic mind
was brilliant,
but I never saw the execution
until she's pulled out that,
"I had a backup plan
at final five."
And that idol that everyone
was elusively looking for--
she had it for a while.
And so, that really cinched
the deal for me.
So it was a combination
of Mike losing it
and Maryanne snatching it
right at the very end.
PROBST:
Mike, let's talk about this.
You just heard them say
that a lot of people
came in here leaning toward you.
And then Maryanne stepped up
and took it.
Even though you didn't win,
you found an idol,
you won an immunity challenge,
you won the fire-making.
You hit almost all of the big,
iconic moments in Survivor.
So what is that feeling
right now for you,
even as a runner-up?
Oh, it feels great.
I lived the dream.
I played Survivor. I played
the hardest I could play.
I have no regrets,
and honestly I think Maryanne,
after hearing her story tonight,
I think she earned it.
Um, there is absolutely
no animosity.
I'm good. I-I played Survivor
at the age of 57
after watching for 21 years.
I did a lot of things
that, honestly, that I watched
on TV and can't believe it.
So, it's a great day
for me, too. You know, it is.
PROBST:
And, Romeo, it's always hard
when somebody makes it this deep
and doesn't get any votes.
What's the feeling you have?
Because I felt like
you moved a lot of people
tonight,
and probably got closer
to their vote
than you were
when you walked in.
And I'm seeing a lot of people
nodding right now.
Did you feel that, as well?
Could you feel
you were moving them?
Yeah, but, you know,
Jeff, for me,
I didn't come here
for a million dollars.
I came here
to see if I could out...
you know, make it
to the end of Survivor.
And I did that.
And I'm leaving this game, uh,
with life experiences
that I would have
never gotten if I hadn't been
here, so I have no regrets.
And to me, being able
to leave the jungles of Fiji
and be free and live the life
that I wanted
to live for a long time
means more to me
than winning a million dollars.
-JONATHAN: Hmm.
-So I feel like
I'm leaving here a winner.
PROBST:
All right,
I have a lot more to talk about.
We're going to take a quick
break. Anybody that needs

let's load it up.

-Oh, my gosh.

about some game moments.
Lindsay, Drea and Hai,
straight out of the gate--
does everybody know
what happened
-in the opening
marooning challenge?
-Yeah.
PROBST:
Lindsay, is the fact
that the three of you
did that a sign
of how you have
to play Survivor, in that
it was one minute into day one,
and you had already made
your decision to go for it?
Yeah, I mean, they both
persuaded me into saying yes,
'cause I kind of said no.
And then I read it
and I'm like, "Well, this sucks.
This is definitely worse
than good."
So I have to hope that they
don't blow up their own game
and then blow up my game.
And it ended up
working out great, where
none of us wanted
to go after each other.
-We all actually wanted
to work together in it...
-Yeah.
...which is, like,
weird but awesome.
And I think that just kind of
says something about all of us.
I don't know. There was a huge
respect level that was different
than just savagery,
solo gameplay, and I thought
that was a big twist
that I wasn't expecting
when I first opened
that advantage.
PROBST:
And again, I keep feeling
like I have to say this.
We have not seen any
of season 41 ourselves
as producers.
We're shooting back-to-back.
I've been in the jungle so long,
I have a mullet.
I mean, nobody has seen
anything, but there have been
themes in both seasons, and one
of the big themes was fun.
We felt like, coming out
of the year we've had,
we wanted to have fun.
And with the blood and the mud,
you came back looking
-like you'd been in a war.
-I was like,
"We're going to commit to this."
And then Hai was like...
-(imitates explosive pop)
-All over, whatever.
-And I was like,
"Let's do this."
Like, "Open your shirt, Hai!"
And I was just, like,
putting the mud over him,
rolling in sand,
and I was just like,
"If we're gonna come play this
game, we're gonna give it
all we got,"
and, like, obviously,
I'm getting the advantage,
so we kind of forced Lindsay
to do it.
PROBST:
Drea, let's talk
about advantages.
Because I don't know,
I didn't check the records,
but I'm not sure how many people
have had as many advantages
-at one time as you did.
-(laughter)
Walk me through the list
of what you had at your height
and what that felt like.
I had an idol,
I had an extra vote,
I had my Shot in the Dark,
and then
I had my Knowledge Is Power,
um, advantage, as well.
-And the amulet.
-DREA: And my amulet. Yeah.
-Yeah.
So I strategically put all
my advantages in my left sock
and then I tied it up
three times and then
I put that sock in my left leg
of my blue tights
-and I tied that up four times.
-Shoot.
-That's impressive.
-DREA: So like, I knew
if someone went through my bag
-and went through my advantages.
-Uh-huh. All right.
General question. Is there
anyone here who will admit
that when the first funny phrase
was said, which was
Maryanne talking about
the bunny rabbit in the mailbox,
that you didn't pick up on it.
You just thought
she was... Okay.
Is there anyone here
who heard all three phrases
and still did not know?
All right.
Good. Well, that's honest.
ROCKSROY:
I think I wasn't paying
attention, Jeff, really.
I think after the second time
Maryanne said the phrase,
I kind of, like, tuned out.
I was like, "Okay, I'm focusing
"on what the challenge
is gonna be.
I have to dive off of what?
How high up?"
Um, I was not...
I was not focused anymore.
So I guess I... (whooshes)
Right over my head.
The Do or Die, Lindsay.
-Oh.
-One of my favorite new twists
because it is literally
Do or Die.
It seemed like you kind of
enjoyed it even though
it had to be petrifying.
Yeah, I mean, it was awesome.
Like, it was
a really cool twist.
And staying
was the coolest part about it.
But the adrenaline rush
and that excitement
and that thrill and that worry
and that fear was really cool.
And would you have been okay
if you had died?
With the twist, yes.
The gamble that I made, no.
So, I still was very regretful
of making that gamble decision.
But the Do or Die itself
is a cool twist
that you have to accept,
if you don't pick the right box,
like, being okay with it.
So that's what
I would have regretted,
not necessarily just
the Do or Die chance thing.
Also, I have to point out,
you were originally slated
to be in Survivor 41.
You tested positive for COVID,
-could not come out.
-JONATHAN: Mm.
PROBST:
And I remember
when we talked on the phone,
and I was so sad for you,
and I hung up, and I said,
"Wow, her attitude is amazing."
'Cause you said, "Hey,
-you know, it'll happen."
-And you even said...
Oh, sorry, but you even said
on the phone,
when I was like, "You never know
what's gonna happen.
I just have to stay lean."
And you're like, "You're talking
about season 43, right?"
I'm like, "No, I'm talking
about season 42."
Something could happen.
If I... If it's gonna happen
to somebody else,
I might be ready...
-You set it up, Jeff.
-Like, I might come here at 42.
That's right.
And I hung up, and I went,
"She's pretty optimistic."
-(laughter)
All right, we're gonna take
another quick break.
When we come back,
more from Fiji.
It's the
Survivor 42 aftershow.
Mike, let me guess. More pizza?
-Yeah, more pizza.
-Okay, more pizza.
-Let's bring it in.
-I may just take the whole box.
PROBST:
Up next,
players share their thoughts
on the new era of Survivor and
how difficult it is to manage
emotions in the game.
♪ ♪
I love that you're having
so much pizza,
so much champagne,
and let's just keep talking.
So, I want to talk
about the whole new era
of Survivor, which is
the 26 days, no rice,
very tough, you earn everything,
crazy twists,
more dangerous game.
-Chanelle, let's start with you.
-Yeah.
How big an impact is
the no rice?
Man, I mean, if someone told me
that I wouldn't eat
for 11 days, I would be like,
"You're crazy."
The way
that you physically feel--
I remember standing up and just
being dizzy and seeing stars
and not being able to walk
more than three steps
without being winded.
And so, it really impacts
your body,
and it makes the game
that much harder.
Jonathan, another part of this
game that we didn't talk about
but became very evident
as you were playing is,
it's rare at Tribal
that there are more
than six or seven people.
We broke you up
into different groups.
Talk about the impact of that.
When you start
with a small tribe,
and you don't have anywhere
to hide at Tribal.
Well, being a bigger guy,
I already felt like,
coming into this,
that I couldn't hide anyways.
And now that we have
small tribes, I was thinking,
"Well, now there's definitely
no place to hide."
And the odds of me getting
kicked out are more than ever.
And that-that worried me,
Mr. Jeff,
that I could be
one of the first
to get kicked off,
and it scared me to death.
PROBST:
And, Omar, on top of it,
not everybody knew early on
that when you took
these journeys,
you had opportunities
to get something,
but it required you
to risk losing your vote.
Yeah, and on top of that,
the Shot in the Dark
might take votes away.
So, you know,
you're in a situation,
especially when the numbers
are so small,
where you may think
something's happening,
and something completely...
a second, third
or even fourth target
could go home
that was never supposed
to go home in the first place.
So, you have to always be
thinking and anticipating
what other people are doing
more than ever before.
Mike, even
the Beware Advantages,
they say very clearly, "Beware."
Do you get excited
with those kinds of changes
where it is riskier?
This game is more difficult now
than it was.
It's extremely riskier.
When I got...
When I found my idol, it said,
"Beware,"
and immediately I said...
I grabbed it. I said,
"I don't care what the
'Beware' is. I got to..."
The thrill of even finding it.
But then, when you open it up,
reality hits, and you say,
"Oh, crap, I don't want this."
Almost it's like,
"Whoa! Get back!"
But then you have to think
about it and say, like,
if you have an advantage that
tells you, you lose your vote,
you kind of have
to tell somebody.
Because if you have
to split votes or something,
you know you're going
to be exposed anyway,
which happened at our vote.
We have another Survivor first.
There were only two votes cast,
which means
two people did not vote.
Didn't anticipate having
to reveal who you are,
but now, because of a tie,
and the inability
to vote somebody out,
you have to.
So, who didn't vote?
We had to raise our hand
like this, like we got caught.
-We don't have our vote.
-PROBST: How about you, Lindsay?
Overall approach
to the game of Survivor,
did it feel riskier
and more dangerous?
Because you come in blind.
You don't know
what is in store for you.
But we had consciously decided
with 41 and 42
to make it more fun
and more dangerous
and see where it takes us.
I actually loved it.
At the beginning,
it was kind of difficult,
like, when you're really
living it,
and all these things
are happening, and you're like,
"Oh, this sucks, this sucks,
this sucks."
These are all really hard,
difficult things
because we all have watched
all the seasons.
So at this point,
things are more predictable.
We are already, like,
mentally planning
what the things are going
to be next.
And with all these twists,
you're like,
"I wasn't prepared for that.
I didn't know
this was going to happen."
But then I was, like,
halfway through. I'm like,
"This is pretty awesome."
Because we're all kind of
experiencing a whole new game
that no one's aware of,
rather than playing a game
that everyone knows
everyone's move
and what's going to happen.
I was like,
"This is pretty cool."
It's like you're in a game of
Jumanji 'cause you're live,
but, like, you have no idea
what the twists are.
So it was cool to, like,
take the ride, so I loved it.
Let's talk about
managing emotions in the game.
-Maryanne.
-(laughter)
I wasn't coming to you
because you're emotional.
Because your emotions are
actually, were, to me,
were always just really fun
and opening.
You were very accessible,
but let's start with you.
How do you deal
with the emotions?
What did you learn about
yourself and your ability,
in the moment,
to manage your emotions?
I feel as if the really
big thing which I learned,
especially in the highs
and lows of Survivor,
is that you need to validate
your feelings, you know?
A lot of times when it's raining
and you feel miserable,
you kind of feel guilty
'cause you're like,
"So many people want to do this,
and I feel bad
that I'm feeling bad."
But then you're like,
"You know what?
"It's okay that I'm feeling bad
because in...
This is a part
of the experience."
And it's like,
I'm going to move.
Like, I'm going to be able to go
to the next day and be like,
"I survived this,
but, like, right now,
"I don't want to survive this.
I want to be home
and I want to be warm
and I don't want to be here."
And that's okay because we all
have our lows and our highs.
Tori, I remember
a few times at Tribal
wondering how you were doing
because you would take heat
and, to your credit,
you would turn and push back.
-Yeah.
-Did you ever go back to camp
and have your own internal
-monologue about how
you were feeling?
-Oh, absolutely.
There... I cried more than I
thought I would, and it's funny
because my family--
all of them, I have, like,
so many family members--
they said
their biggest worry
of me coming out here was
I was gonna be too emotional.
I was like,
"No, it's a game. I'll
compartmentalize. No worries."
No, it was, like, day three,
I was crying in the ocean
by myself.
Cried to so many people
in my tribe.
You just don't understand, like,
what's really gonna happen
when you're here,
but I recognize
from this that my emotions
are my greatest strength.
Like, as a therapist,
I have to be empathetic.
I have to be emotional.
But they can also be
my greatest weakness.
So what makes you good,
what makes you...
is also what makes you bad.
And so, I-I really
learned more about that
-coming out here for sure.
-PROBST: I'm curious.
How many people...?
Big shot, Dryden.
How many people will admit
that they had a moment,
even if it was
just in private,
whether there were tears or not,
it was the equivalent
of an emotional cry?
-Wow.
-PROBST: Wow. Every person.
So nobody can get away
from that.
Omar, why is that?
What is it that happens
that brings you to that point?
I mean, I, like, almost never
cry in real life, so the fact
that I cried so many times
out here is outrageous.
But I think it really is
'cause you're stripped
to the core of who you are.
You have no comfort
that you would normally have
in real life,
and your emotional support
system is absent,
and you have nothing
but time to think.
And, you know, sometimes
painful memories
from your past come back.
And you're in an environment
where you can embrace that
and let it out.
And sometimes
it's game-related,
sometimes it's not, but it's...
You're so stripped of everything
that emotion just comes out.
And I cried more here
than I have
in the last two years, probably.
Drea, how about for you?
Before you answer,
this is my take on you.
And remember, I'm not
on the beaches with you.
By design, my job is
to just observe the things
I get to see
and see what I can learn
and not really know everything
that's going on.
But you always strike me
as a little bit like this,
but inside I think
your heart is like this.
-Did you have your moments?
-Yeah, that's me.
And I had plenty of moments
here on this island.
I cried at night, by myself,
when people weren't here.
I was starving.
I barely slept.
It was very emotional for me.
-This was very hard
for me, yeah.
-Hmm.
We're gonna take
another quick break.
When we come back, though,
I'm gonna ask Omar
to name some animals he thinks
describe the final three.
-Yeah.
-(laughter)
We'll be right back.
It's a Survivor...
Yeah, come on in
with more champagne.
-It's Survivor 42 aftershow.
-Oh, yeah, I'm so full.
PROBST:
Up next, we check back in
with our final three, and
your first look at Survivor 43.
Welcome back to the
Survivor 42 aftershow.
And I should clear up.
It's not like
we have a giant catering team.
What's cool about our team is,
half the people
doing this right now
are the same people
-that were out there
on the beach with you.
-I know.
-It's awesome.
-They're our shooters,
they're our ACs,
they're our audio team.
It's just, Survivor is this big
family, which is why, for me,
this is the most real reactions
we're ever going to get.
So, Omar, let's have some fun.
You love animals.
-Yeah.
-Let's name some animals
that describe Maryanne,
Romeo and Mike.
Okay. So, uh, Maryanne is
definitely the Amazon parrot.
Google them singing and laughing
and imitating voices
and being so cheery all over
the place, but underneath that,
they have the intelligence
of a toddler.
And I don't mean that
as an insult to you,
but for a bird
that's pretty good.
So, like, they're
very intelligent animals,
but they have that fun
and goofy side
that always keeps you laughing.
Um, Romeo in the game--
'cause I don't know him
outside the game--
reminded me of like
a little fledgling bird
who's leaving the nest
but then, like, falls
and breaks its wing.
And then I got to take it in
and, like, try to heal it
and watch him grow,
and he matured into a finalist.
So, you know, he's the
little robin that could.
Mike, uh...
I don't know, man.
JONATHAN:
Grizzly bear.
-No.
-No?
-No.
-PROBST: Jonathan,
give the man a moment.
This is his specialty.
-(laughter)
-Yeah.
I feel like Mike is like...
Oh, my gosh.
-Like a koala bear?
-Koala.
Like, strong, solid,
eats the same thing every day,
a little bit cuddly,
but he's got a little bit
of those claws
that you don't see coming
-until he blindsides you.
-Oh!
-Ooh.
But ultimately
he's got a good heart
and, um, he's... he is just
a cuddly, big teddy bear.
-I'll take it.
-PROBST: All right, I want to,
for the last couple
of minutes here,
I just want to check back in
with our final three
because you've been through
so much.
You literally just finished 26
of the most intense days
of your life.
Then you faced your jury,
and they grilled you.
And now we have a winner,
so there's no doubt,
you're going home knowing.
You're going to go home
trying to keep a secret,
hopefully.
So, Romeo,
what is the feeling?
You've got a little food
in your stomach,
-you're 96 pounds now
instead of 95.
-Oh.
What is your feeling?
Are you proud of yourself?
Yes, I'm very proud
of myself, um,
because like I said before,
I came here for the experience.
And I got the whole experience.
I went as far
as anyone can go in this game.
And I have no hard feelings.
It's a game.
I still love these people
and I still want
to hang out with them.
And I feel like I grew out here.
And Omar's reference, yes,
I'll take that.
You know, I was very scared,
very paranoid,
and in the end I won
that final immunity challenge.
-Mm-hmm.
-And I thought, I won.
-Yeah.
-I-I... You know,
in the game of life,
I feel like I won.
-Can't ask
for more than that, right?
-No.
How about you, Mike?
But here's what I'm wondering.
You got very quiet,
and I don't know because...
It could just be the pizza
that you're putting down
-one piece after another.
-It is.
But are you good with this?
I'm extremely good with it.
Good things are gonna happen
with that money.
Quite frankly, not that
I don't want the money,
but I don't really
need the money. I-I...
As I told everybody,
I'm happy in life.
I have my fiancée. I have
my kids. I'm already rich.
She's a young girl setting out.
And I know good things are going
to happen with that money,
so I'm extremely fine
with everything.
And honestly I really like
everybody in this cast.
There's not a mean person here.
Which brings us to you,
Maryanne.
I remember meeting you.
I remember
the first time we spoke,
and I remember thinking,
"She's got to be on the show.
She's just too fun."
You're too energetic.
Your smile is too amazing.
What I didn't know about you
or didn't expect about you
is how good you would be.
I think you were really good
at this game.
I think you worked people
at the right time.
I think you used your charm,
maybe more than you're saying.
I think you were
a very impressive winner.
-Oh, my gosh.
-And as you sit here now,
knowing that you have a million
dollars, you're the winner
of Survivor 42-- as you said,
one of only 40 winners
for a show
that's been on 21 years!
-MARYANNE: Oh, my gosh.
-(laughter)
(sighs dramatically)
How do you feel right now?
Close us out.
It still feels like
this isn't happening.
Like, I feel as if it's like
I always knew
that I was going
to go on the show.
But I remember, like,
going and literally leaving
and writing my bucket list, and
having my sister look at it,
and she's like, "Why isn't
winning on this bucket list?"
And I truly didn't think
I was going to win.
Like, she's like, "You're going
into this game thinking
you can't win,"
and I'm like, "Yeah." Like,
I was already thinking about,
like, all my cool jury outfits
and which one I was gonna
wear to this one and this one
because until, like, the day
before I came out here,
I didn't think
I had the ability to win.
And it's like, to come out here
and then to play a game,
then after, to play a, clearly,
like, one of the slop...
a very sloppy game, according to
the jury members, which is fine,
but then to still
pull it out and, like,
be able to win...
It's like when I told you
how I feel like I'm dreaming
at the marooning,
it feels like
I'm dreaming right now.
Well, I'm really proud
that you won.
You're a great winner.
-I think you're gonna represent
Survivor well.
-TORI: Yes.
-Yes, you are!
-Oh, my gosh.
I'm so happy that you did
what you did to get out here.
Because I know it took a lot
for us to get here.
I know it took a lot
for you to get here,
and then your family,
your friends,
whoever supported you
to get out here.
I hope you feel it was worth it.
I loved watching you play.
This was a great season of
Survivor, and to the players,
the non-jury who aren't here,
we're sorry
that you aren't here.
I wish they could be here
as well.
This has been the best time
out in the jungles of Fiji.
And to all of you who continue
to watch Survivor,
we thank you.
It's not like you're fans.
We're a triad. Some people
produce, some people play,
some people watch
and then end up playing
and then come back watching.
But it's all this just big
family, and we've had a blast.
And I look forward
to bringing you
-Survivor 43 next.
