        ♪♪♪
 jeff: All right!
Nice, excited crowd.
Have a seat.
( cheers and applause )
That's a nice welcome.
It is good to be live in new
York city.
All right.
Well, I gotta say,
Congratulations, natalie, rob,








Phillip.
This is a-- this game is so much
Tougher, I think, than anybody
Can ever know.
Even I don't appreciate it and
I've been out there doing this
For 22 seasons.
So I always tip my hat to you
Guys.
You survived a rough tribal
Council, final tribal.
These guys were not easy on you.
But in a minute, at least for
One of you, it's not going to








Really matter because somebody
Is about to become a
Millionaire.
Deep breath.
You nervous, natalie?
 yeah, a little bit.
It is what it is.
 jeff: Do you think you have
A shot at winning this game?
 I tried my best.
I did what I could do.
And I'm just-- I've taken so
Much out of this game and so
Much knowledge and so much--
Just, like --
 all right, yes or no?
 yes
( laughter )
I do.
 jeff: Rob, you can win this
Game?
 I hope so.
You know, I think natalie said
It best.
All you can do is your best.
 jeff: Phillip, do you,
After everything you've been
Through have a shot at having
Votes in here enough to win you
A million bucks?
 yeah.
 jeff: All right, let's get
To the votes.
These are votes for a winner.
Tonight you want to see your
Name on the parchment.
For a million bucks, I'll read
The votes.
( applause )
First vote, rob.
( applause )
Phillip.
( applause )
One vote rob, one vote phillip.
Rob.
( applause )
Two votes rob, one vote phillip.
Rob.
That's three votes rob, one vote
Phillip.
Rob.
( applause )
That's four votes rob, one vote
Phillip.
No votes natalie.
The winner of "survivor:
Redemption island," rob.
 jeff: After playing a
Record four times, boston rob
Final lie accomplished his goal
Of winning "survivor," and he
Did it with a style that would
Make any mob boss proud.
Redemption island added a new
Twist-- it challenged matt's
Faith and sent the game's
Greatest villain, russell, home
In tears, and phillip sheppard
Emerged as one of the most
Polarizing people to ever play.
The big question-- is he really
A former federal agent?
We will find out.
We are live in new york city!
"survivor: Redemption island"
Reunion show is next.
 jeff: Rob wins immunity!
 hey, baby, maybe I learned
Something since last time.
It really doesn't even matter
What the clue says because I
Already have the idol, so might
As well just throw it away.
>away.
I'm running my tribe like the
Army-- I'm the general.
They're soldiers, and they're
All doing as they're told.
 jeff: Matt, the tribe has
Spoken.
 one man should not have this
Much power in this game.
Luckily, I'm not an ordinary man
Superman.
 superman.
( applause )
 jeff: Welcome to the
"survivor: Redemption island"
Live reunion show.
Congratulations, boston rob.
Four times--
( applause )
And a record 117 days played in
This game.
Coming in to this, knowing you
Had-- you had, obviously, you
Had a target on your back.
What odds did you give yourself?
 well, you know, I knew from
The very beginning, if I was
Able to get my foot in the door,
If I could get these people to
At least play with me, they
Would have a shot.
You know, they didn't realize
How nervous I was the first day
I was out there.
They held all the power.
But they didn't know that.
So I knew if I could get in and
Start to build relationships,
And I could show them they would
Be helpful around camp, that,
You know, I could get in a good
Alliance and then work my way
From dl.
 jeff: Was there a key
Moment the first few days?
 uh, yes and no.
I mean, kristina, going and
Looking for the idol feverishly
On the first day, kind of put a
Target on her.
And, you know, building the
Shelter and working together
With everybody, I kind of showed
Them that, you know what?
I have some experience, and let
Me show you how, because, you
Know what?
Even if I get all the way to the
End, nobody will vote for me to
Win.
And that's, you know --
 when you were assessing who
To make your alliance with off
The top, what was the thought
Process?
Why did you end up with who you
Had in your group?
 loyalty.
At first.
You know, that was the main
Thing.
Natalie, I knew that, you know,
She was young, and that she
Needed someone to help, you
Know, go through this game with,
And they could be that person
For her.
And in return, she would, you
Know, stay loyal to me.
 jeff: One of the things
That I heard all season was
Nobody in your alliance talked
To anybody else.
It was kind of cult-like.
 you know what?
( laughter )
It was too a degree.
But it was a lot of hard work,
Too.
It looks easy when you're
Sitting at home watching it, but
I would constantly be going back
And checking with each and every
Member and making sure that
Nobody was talking to anybody
Else, and if they were, I
Pretended to have an open-door
Policy with everybody where we
All put everything on the table.
Of course, I kept a lot of it to
Myself.
But it was a lot of hard work.
It wasn't as easy as it looked.
 jeff: Ashley, what happene
Happened?
You know, I was tweeting live
During these episodes, and the
One thing that kept coming up
Is, "why aren't these girls
Flipping it on rob?"
Why did it never happen?
 there was a pivotal point
When I had won immunity going
Into, I think, andrea had just
Come back from redemption.
And we knew-- natalie and I knew
That rob had an idol.
We knew that.
He told us that he found an idol
After the merge.
So we were like-- I don't know.
You're so scared when you're out
There, or something.
Like, it was just-- we knew he
Was going to play the idol.
And at that point, I had
Immunity, and I felt like I had
Control and that was the best
Move for me.
 jeff: I gotta interrupt.
I don't know if we can hear
This.
Is that your baby?
That's boston rob's baby out
There.
And daughter saying, "daddy,
Daddy, daddy."
I think we understand why.
Amber, if you need to leave, if
They get too loud, you just
Skedaddle.
It's fine.
No hard feelings.
Andrea, you're at home now
Watching this whole thing play
Out.
What do you take from how rob
Played?
 rob played a brilliant game,
And also what you don't see, is
The way he built relationships
With each of us was so
Individual that you felt-- you
Know, I looked at him as an
Older brother.
We spent two days billion a
Daybed for no reason.
And you look at those
Relationships, and you feel
Close to someone.
We all, grant, all of us, had
This different relationship with
Rob and that's just brilliant.
 jeff: What it you learn?
You play again, what did you
Take from this?
 you have to be constantly
Checking in with everybody.
What did you do, what were you
Talking about over there?
You see him doing that with
Everyone and you become
Comfortable.
Everything he does can with
Checking in, constantly having
To know what's going on.
Never become comfortable,
Either.
 jeff: Rob, what did you see
In phillip that nobody else did.
 here's the thing about
Phillip, with all the talk that
Was said back and forth.
Phillip is a lovable guy.
He's a guy that, you know, if
You just listen to him for a
Second and listen to the story
That he's trying to tell.
He comes from a family of 12.
He left home at 16.
He's going on and on.
And just imagine what that's
Like for a minute to come from a
Family of 12.
You've got to be constantly
Fighting for attention.
And I just said, you know what?
Here's a guy that if I show him
Some love, he will-- he will be
There for me.
I mine it's not any different
Than what any of us want.
You know, we all want to be
Loved.
And we all want to be heard.
Everybody else would be giving
It to phillip for giving him a
Hard time-- socially, there were
Times when you weren't, you
Know--
( laughter )
It wasn't a picnic.
But at the same time, he was
Someone that, you know, I could
Go to and I could find a common
Ground, and we could exchange,
You know, and have an exchange
On that.
 jeff: Phillip, I--
( applause )
I want to talk to you later in
The show, but I gotta ask right
Now.
You seem-- either you're just
Very reserved or you're down.
Are you down right now?
 no, I'm attentive and I'm
Listening and --
 quick, tell me what I'm
Thinking.
What am I thinking?
 what you're thinking right
Now is, "what is phillip really
Thinking?"
( laughter )
( applause )
 jeff: Natalie, did your
Loyalty to rob ever waiver, even
Though we might not have seen it
In the show.
Did you truly consider turning
On him at any point?
 I mean, I think I would have
If he didn't have the idol, but
Because he did, like ashley was
Saying, I mean, we couldn't vote
For him.
We knew it was the last time he
Could play the idol.
There's no way he wouldn't.
So I put myself in a position
Where either basically I'm going
To the end no matter what,
Because I have ashley and I have
Rob.
 jeff: How was the final
Tribal for you.
Julie was particularly harsh on
You.
You were, julie.
 I was.
 jeff: As a mother yourself,
Those were pretty tough words to
Say to a young woman.
How did it impact you?
 I think I'm stronger than I
Think I am.
Because in my life, I-- I've
Given to what people say and I
Think what this experience has
Given me is just, like, take it
With a grain of salt, and move
On.
Move on.
( applause )
Because--
 jeff: Julie, when you saw
That played back, any regrets on
That?
 uhm, you know, now that we're
Sitting here, yes.
Yes, because natalie is a great
Person.
But what I lived through was so
Much frustration because here's
These women that are just being
Blindsided by this guy that's
Played the game four times.
I just wanted to shake them,
"come on!
Wake up!
We can do a female alliance."
Hats off to rob's leadership --
 I mean, the obvious comeback
Is I made it to the final three.
You're back row, jury.
 absolutely, absolute, you're
Right.
 jeff: Right?
 absolutely, and my hat's off
To them.
It is.
 jeff: Rob, one of the
Things that started happening
With the ometepe six, is that
After you guys had the easy
Votes to get rid of zapatera,
Then you had to turn on each
Other, and the one they think--
The one that got to me the most
Was you and grant.
Because knowing you-- after you
Played so many times, I have a
Pretty good idea of what you're
Like, that you and grant in
Normal life would probably be
The closest of anybody here.
Have you repaired that damage?
 you know, it was really
Tough, you know, watching it
Back.
Grant and I communicated quite a
Bit when we got back from-- from
Nicaragua.
And when-- when the-- when the
Show first started.
And I stopped hearing from him,
Probably about three or four
Episodes in.
And he wouldn't return my phone
Call, wouldn't return a text
From me.
And I just want to say, bro, in
I hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.
I was just plaga game, but, you
Know, no hard feelings.
We haven't really got to that
Point.
We've seen each other all day
Today --
 grant, certainly I'm not
Phillip.
I'm not a specialist and I cant
Read your mind but I can read
Body language and your body
Language looks right now that
You might jump rob rather than
Hug rob.
 uhm, there comes-- there
Comes a point where you have t
To-- in this game "survivor"
Where do you draw the line
Between I'm going to call this a
Game, where in actuality, it's a
Direct reflection of your life,
Of who you are.
And as much as we can cop out,
So to speak, and say this is a
Game, for me, the experience
Was-- the experience was much
Different than that.
 jeff: Rob, do you think
That might be in part because
You've played so many times?
Do you learn how not to take
This game personally?
 well, you know what, I think
You have to, in your mind set--
If you-- let's put it this way.
If you draw a line in the sand
And say, "I will not cross this
Line," then you get out there on
The island, and start playing
The game, then you're going to
Be constantly flirting with am I
Going to go over this line?
Am I not going to go over this
Line.
It's a lot easier to say, "I'm
Playing a game and I'm going to
Do whatever it takes to win."
At the same time, I understand
His point of view because you're
Out there living with these
People 24 hours a day, so the
Relationships you make are real.
At the end of the day, I looked
At it like I'm going to try to
Win a million dollars for my
Family.
 jeff: Well, I gotta say,
I've annoyed a lot of people
Over the seasons by having an
Ne now.
For my money, in 22 seasons,
That's as close to a perfect
Game as anybody's ever played on
"survivor."
( applause )
Coming up next, russell hantz.
Has he recovered from his early
Demise?
Matt spent 27 days on redemption
Island.
It nearly broke his spirit.
And phillip, was there a method
To his madness or is phillip
Just mad?
We will find out.
We are live in new york.
It is the "survivor: Redemption
Island reunion show.
We'll be right back.
 it's stealth.
And I am known as the
Specialist.
Boston rob, the mentalist.
Where's grant?
Better known as the assassin.
 jeff: Wow.
 I got blindsided.
If god wants me to go a step
Further, so be it.
 jeff: Matt seizes the
Moment and will re-enter this
Game.
 you guys, give me a minute.
 jeff: Matt, you need to
Bring me your torch.
 the game of "survivor" is
Long.
God has literally been carrying
Me.
But I wouldn't change anything.
 I was out there so long --
 either way you have a few
Records.
You have the most days spend
Ever on redemption island.
Somewhere around a month.
You won 10 out of 11 duels.
And you were--
( applause )
And you were the first person to
Be blindsided twice.
( laughter )
In the same season.
It seemed like it took a really
Big toll on you emotionally.
How bad did it get for you?
 uhm, I mean, my lowest point
Was definitely when I broke and
You saw me crying.
And talking about god carrying
Me.
That was so true.
But I think that was even after
The duel with julie.
I was just so over the game.
I felt so alone.
I was completely exhausted.
 jeff: Well, there was a
Time to remind people had you
Said, "I want to go home unless
God doesn't want me to," and god
Didn't want you to, and he gave
You another week or so.
 yeah.
That's definitely true.
I mean, god does what he wants
To.
And we have to be respectful of
That, whether it's what we want
Or not.
But, really, I'm just so
Thankful for the way that
Everything came out.
It was really a life-changing
Experience, and I loved every
Minute of it.
 jeff: How so?
What did you learn?
 uhm, well, I started the game
Deciding that I was going to
Blindly follow my heart, and I
Take away from it that following
Your heart doesn't necessarily
Mean ignoring lodge and I can
Reason.
But--
( laughter )
But it's important to evaluate
The context of the situation you
Find yourself in.
And make an educated decision
With what you know and go from
There.
So --
 can you describe what it's
Like-- because you spent a lot
Of that time alone.
 I did spend a lot of that
Time alone.
And I have a stellar nicaraguan
Rock collection
( laughter )
But it's really difficult.
Just the simple tasks become
Impossible-- collecting
Firewood, starting the fire,
Cook the rice, cleaning the
Pots-- it's very lonely and kind
Of miserable at times.
 jeff: What do your family
And friend say about, you know,
What you went through and what
They saw?
You were very exposed out there
A lot.
 uhm, I mean, everyone says
Their heart were just breaking
For me, but at the same time
They're like, "wow, the way you
Got to talk about your faith and
Talk about what god was doing
For you, so incredible."
And the people who know me
Really well said, "redemption
Island was the best place for
You since you like to be by
Yourself so much.
 jeff: Andrea, there was
Some talk or speculation that
Maybe there was a little
Connection going on there,
Love-wise?
Any love interest between you
And matt?
 uhm, matt's cute.
I mean, look at him.
I think we can all agree.
 jeff: Andrea.
 I don't know.
I think matt's cool.
I'm probably blushing.
 jeff: That's a yes?
Matt, is there anything?
Have you guys spoken, talked,
Gone on a date?
 well, I'm in nashville, and
She's in wisconsin so it's a
Pretty big distance.
We definitely had a connection
On the island --
 you'll be friends forever.
I get it.
Mike, I think we have a photo of
You from the war.
You've been in our armed forces.
You've been out there--
( applause )
Protecting our country.
So-- so you have an idea of what
It's like to go through
Something tough.
How-- and this is a tough
Comparison to make, but is there
Any parallel between the
Deprivation you go through on
This show?
 well, jeff, there's a lot of
Soul-searching that went on with
Me.
"survivor" transformed me as a
Human being, as a man, as an
American.
I-- it helped me understand my
Purpose and what-- what I'm
Doing with my life.
I got closer to god.
It was great to have talks with
Matt.
God bless our-- our troops and
Our service members
( cheers and applause )
God bless them.
"survivor--" "survivor" is a
Challenge.
It's a challenge.
I signed up-- in the marine
Corps I still bleed green.
My heart bleeds green.
Once a marine, always a marine.
And the strife and the hardship
That we go through over in iraq,
Or over in afghanistan, or
Wherever-- wherever our troops
Are, does not compare to
"survivor."
However, "survivor" is very real
And very difficult.
Your life's just not on the
Line.
You know.
And --
 how many times a night, as we
Go to break, do you think about
That last challenge and how
Close you might have been to a
Million dollars?
 I was tired of coming in
Second place, jeff.
You know, there were so many
Challenges where I almost had
Immunity.
Our tribe was one down at the
Merge.
We almost had matt.
We almost had him.
And I wanted to win "survivor."
Took out russell hantz.
I had rob in my crosshairs.
I didn't have enough to get him.
I love this game.
I'm passionate about it.
And, you know, I really, really
Had a great experience.
It was great for me.
 jeff: All right, still to
Come.
Sprint is going to a ward
$100,000 to one of the season's
Castweighs based on your votes.
Up next, he came into this
Season the most notorious
Villain in "survivor" history.
He went out in tears.
Will evil russell ever play
Again?
And the answer to the biggest
Question of the season-- is
Phillip sheppard really a former
Federal agent?
We'll be right back.
( cheers and applause )
 my trunks were hidden so my
Great-great grandfather came to
Me in a vision and he said,
"look near the water pole."
Am I good or what?
Don't mess with the undercover
Specialist.
 jeff: Russell, you are out
Of this game.
Is it embarrassment at finally
Losing?
 no.
I respect this game too much to
Go out this way.
( applause ).
 jeff: Welcome back to the
"survivor: Redemption island"
Reunion show.
We're live in new york city.
Russell hantz, what was it like?
What did your fans say when they
Saw you cry?
 it's just rough.
It's the hardest thing I've ever
Had to do in my life, you know,
And it's so emotionally-- you
Get so emotionally involved,
Especially after playing three
Times.
But I-- you know, first of all,
I have to say,-- I have to
Congratulate rob.
And he played an excellent game.
And I want to see if he's going
To shake my hand this time.
Rob?
 oh!
( applause )
 jeff: Yeah, it was really--
At the end of the
"heroes-villains" live show that
Whole idea was born when you
Guys challenged each other.
So zapatera, your tribe,
Somented you out of this game,
They threw a challenge to get
You out.
Is that fair in "survivor in?
 you see, the amazing thing,
I'm-- you're such a great host
And you're not asking the
Question that I'm sure everybody
Wants to hear and that question
Is do you regret your decision
In throwing a challenge seven
Days in for a million dollars?
Now we've got I'm half this
Man's size and he's afraid of
Me?
I got two people in my alliance,
Two.
And they've got six.
It's impossible-- they can
Control me.
But I can't make things
Disappear and appear.
I know they might think I can.
But I can't just make things
Vanish.
So just try to control me.
And, you know, it makes me sick
To my stomach when I hear steve
Tell people like phillip that
He's not a man when this man
Gave up-- gave up his momentum,
A professional football player,
Threw in the towel, and-- in a
Game-- jeff, you have to tell me
That they had a bounty on my
Head.
How in the world-- you know, I
Can't think they're that idiots.
I can't think that they're that
Stupid.
 jeff: Phillip with all
This-- uhm-- that you have going
On right now--
 russell.
 jeff: Russell, sorry.
Wow!
I don't know if that was
Freudian or what.
Maybe you two should show down
Next, phillip and russell.
The specialist might have your
Number.
So, russell, with everything you
Have going on inside you right
Now, I can still see that
You'rasmed about this game.
Your last worms were,"I'm done.
I'll never play again."
That has changed.
Is the door open that you might
Play again?
 it's like a piece of me.
It's a part of me, you know, and
It's hard to-- I gotta say-- I
Gotta say no, but it's so
Ingrained in me.
 jeff: Should we not call?
( laughter )
Do you want us to throw your
Number away?
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
 I'm two-time fan favorite
Right now.
 jeff: Do you want me to
Keep the phone number or dump
It?
Yes or no?
 just keep my number.
 jeff: All right.
Well, russell was one of the
Most polarizes survivors in
History.
Until phillip showed up.
 I'm a former federal agent.
That's right, special agent
Sheppard.
I'm a former special agent.
A federal agent.
I worked for the government as a
Federal agent in the department
They wonder in.
I'm a former federal agent.
Diit for three separate agencys.
And I am known as "the
Specialist."
( applause )
 jeff: Phillip sheppard.
So, was there-- was there a
Method to your madness?
 absolutely.
I woke up on day two, and saw
That boston rob had a grip on
The tribe.
And I went four more days, and
That grip was unchanging.
This was no window for me to
Talk to anybody in my tribe.
So I came up with a plan.
How do you get close to the guy
Who's going to control this
Tribe?
Dismasts most villainous person
While-- within our tribe-- to
Make sure that they would see--
Rob would see that I was the
Focus, and that would keep the
Focus off of him and he would
Appreciate that.
 jeff: What's been the
Reaction on the street from
People?
Clearly, people love or hate
You.
 they absolutely love me.
I don't run into anybody that
Doesn't does not love me
( applause )
Most people describe it--
Describe me as "you're a
Brilliant player."
And there was one other
Component to my game that was
Missed by most, and that is I
Played with a certain level of
Integrity.
I was not going to trade my
Integrity for a million dollars.
 jeff: I know, something
That went on just-- just-- does
That surprise you that people
Laugh?
These guys are laughing.
The people in the audience are
Latching.
You just gave a very heart-felt
Comment.
 it doesn't surprise me.
I would ask the audience just to
Know whenever you saw an
Interview with me, not one time
That I recall did you ever hear
Me talk about any one member of
This entire audience, even
When--
 you talked about me all the
Time.
 no, excuse me.
When I would talk about you, I
Would talk about you to your
Face.
 jeff: Phillip, this is why
You're great.
This is why phillip is great.
 excuse me, excuse me --
 phillip, hold on --
 I said in the interview-- in-
 I know, I know.
Stop.
 I said in the interview.
 jeff: Stop, stop, phillip,
We're live.
You know I'm your biggest fan,
And I want to get to the bottom
Of something-- two things
Quickly, quickly.
Okay, one is very heated
Discussion between and you steve
About race.
"survivor's" a tough game, I
Know.
Have you guys healed that wound?
 we haven't, but we are.
You know, the specialist doesn't
Make a mistake, but he made one
In this game.
Steve, I hope you accept my
Apology.
 I do, always
( applause )
 jeff: Now there's one more
Big question.
All right, this is what I know
For sure.
Throw up the photo, michael.
I know you served in the army in
1984.
There's phillip sheppard as a
Young man.
Now you've told everybody you're
A former federal agent.
What agency did you serve with?
 I served with the defense
Investigative services as a
Special agent and I also worked
With the naval investigative
Service as an ajudeicator.
 jeff: Now, to make sure
This is authenticated, we have
Brought somebody from your past
That I'm going to go interview
Right now, and we're going to
Find out if this is true.
Diane hardy, stand up, please.
Okay, now I met diane earlier.
I've seen your credentials.
I sasaw the shiny badge.
I saw it all.
You are an active federal agent.
 yes.
 jeff: How do you know
Phillip sheppard?
 phillip and I met one
Another, we attended the
Training academy, and phillip
Was an outstanding student, in
My opinion
( applause )
 jeff: Now, are you saying
This because you think he needs
Some help?
 no, no.
Before the training, we're given
A manual.
And phillip came to the academy.
He knew the manual inside out.
It was as as if as though he
Memorized the manual.
After the training we went to
Different locations so I did not
Work on the job with phillip.
But I know if he conducted
Himself as he did at the
Training academy, he was an
Outstanding federal agent.

Question?
Do we buy this?

Unsure.

Them, and she is an active
Federal agent.

The question remains and so will
The question mark.

Relationship going right now?
