 --- 

        We're on board a Mil-17 Helicopter
piloted by the Nicaraguan Air Force,
flying over the pacific ocean in
Central America, where these Americans
have already begun the
adventure of a lifetime.
Each castaway is arriving with
nothing but the clothes on their back
and their own unique story.
I'm the C.E.O. of my
own software company.
But are there other layers on me?
Absolutely. I'm a former federal agent.
That's right, special agent Sheppard.
That was my first and
middle name for years.
My faith is everything. My
entire life revolves around it.
I pray every day as I strive
to become more like my savior.








They will call me a redneck,
one crazy, student bastard.
We ain't ever had a dumb ass
win the game, maybe it's my turn.
It's the ultimate challenge,
a group of strangers
forced to work together while
battling the elements and each other.
They must learn to adapt
or they'll be voted out.
In the end, only one will remain
to claim the million-dollar prize.
39 days, 18 people, one Survivor.
Come on, let's go. Everybody off!
We're on the beach, and we
saw the mats and it's like,
oh wow, this is really happening.
I'm really on "Survivor."
All right, guys, let's head in.
I was in the Marine Corps. Spent
two deployments, went to Iraq twice.
I think I'm going to win
just because of my background.








I think I've been trained
for something like this.
Welcome to "Survivor."
Before we get started, we've
got two more players joining us.
Right here.
- Is that Rob?
- Boston Rob!
- Oh, no.
- No.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God! It's Russell.
I don't even know whose team
he's going to be on, but I'm going
to stare down Russell, and I
know when I stare down Russell,
he'll know, oh, she's got
a little evil inside of her
because if I'm not the one person
he picks to keep to the end,
then no matter what, I'm going
to be out. I'm gonna be out.
I think everybody here is familiar
with Boston Rob and Russell.
Boston Rob has proven his
ability to help a tribe
not only in challenges,
but in camp life.
He has played three times.
He's made it to the final once.
He has never won.
Russell, in back-to-back
seasons, Russell masterminded
two of the strongest alliances
in "Survivor" history.
Russell has played twice.
He's been to the end twice.
He has never won.
Together, these two offer 156 days...
of "Survivor" experience.
That is worth a ton out here.
They're sizing us up like we're prey.
- What's your name?
- Francesca.
Francesca what's your reaction? You said
these guys were sizing you up as prey?
Yeah, they're trouble makers.
They're two of the most famous
trouble makers in "Survivor" history
so I don't think they're
here just to help us out.
So the question now is who
is going to which tribe?
We're going to do it old school,
guy. We're going to draw for buffs.
Oh, my god.
They're covered, so we're not giving
anything away. Rob, take your pick.
Russell, this is for you.
All right, let's reveal.
Yes!
Yes!
Rob. You join Ometepe. Take a spot.
All right, baby!
- Russell Hantz, you join Zapatera.
- Come on Russell! Let's go, buddy.
- We welcome you.
- Take a spot.
Join in! Join in!
All right, there is one more twist.
When you are voted out at tribal
council, you will not go home.
What?
Instead, you will leave tribal council,
and you will be sent
to Redemption Island.
Where you will live alone.
You will have the same basic supplies
that your tribemates had back at camp,
but it will be up to you
to keep the shelter going.
It will be up to you to tend the fire.
It will be up to you to feed yourself.
It will not be easy.
When the next person joins
you on Redemption Island,
the two of you will
square off in a duel.
- What?
- The winner stays.
The losers is out of the game for good.
At a certain point in the game,
the remaining person on
Redemption Island will be allowed
to re-enter the game and
continue their pursuit of the
title of Sole Survivor, and
the million-dollar prize.
Sweet!
Redemption Island does not scare
me one bit. It's a vacation.
Yeah. Put me on that
island, see what happens.
Because I'm going to win the
challenge and I'm going to come back
and I'm going to take some heads off.
You guys ready to get
started with this game?
Yes!
Ometepe, a map to your camp.
Zapatera, a map to your camp.
It is going to rain a
lot out here in Nicaragua.
I suggest you get to camp
quickly, start using the experience
of Rob and Russell, start building camp.
Ometepe, you're heading out
that way. Zapatera, that way.
When Jeff told us what
Redemption Island is, I was like,
I didn't even know how to process
it. I mean, it makes Rob and Russell
being here a lot more
complicated because they could
definitely come back into the
game even if we get rid of them.
The good part of it is
that if I get voted out,
I could come back into the game.
But the possibility of getting
voted out was so not a reality to me
that I only saw it as a
downside. I'm like, damn it!
Someone I vote out is going to
come back to haunt me... Crap.
Home!
As soon as I walked to the camp,
I was so greatful to be back
to get my title of Sole Survivor.
- It's the power of purple.
- Yes.
The first two, I was a school
boy. This one, I'm bringing it.
Steve.
This is going to be the new me. I'm
going to be the leader to my tribe.
When I sit them all down and
I take control of the camp,
I'll become the leader of the camp.
- Attention.
- Attention.
- Everybody, attention.
- I got a little something to say.
You know, you see it
on TV, it seems easy.
I promise you, you're about to
experience the toughest thing
that you've ever been
through in your entire life.
I'm not here to sabotage
anything from nobody.
If I came back and did something like
that, it would be pretty stupid of me.
- I'm here to win.
- Right on.
- Let's do it!
- Zapatera!
- One, two, three.
- Zapatera!
I think anybody who doesn't
think Russel is truss is foolish.
He's played the game twice and
ended up in the finals twice.
He hasn't won and there's
no mystery why he hasn't won.
It's the way he's chosen
to play the game both times.
He's too aggressive and he
wants the blood on his hands.
- All right, boys, let's take it away.
- ***
- All right!
- Okay.
When I seen a big box of
nails and all that, I love it.
How about that. We've got it all.
Can't wait to get started.
I've camped. I've built cabins.
I've done all this kind of stuff.
We can put it right here.
Right here's another fork.
We done got our slope.
If they listen to me, I believe
we can build a decent shack.
Some of them I don't
think knows what's going on
but I don't want them to know that.
- Superhero nickname, Steel Wood.
- Steel Wood.
You can get through anything
with a little bit of elbow grease.
And you have the most impressive
man sweater I have ever seen.
It's amazing!
You wouldn't help me put
these back on, would you?
First impression, very good impression.
I think we have a bun of
worker bees which is good.
As long as we can win and city
away from the immunity challenges,
There you go.
Get up there. All right!
Put it in there. Okay.
- Okay, Ralph, tell us what you need.
- All right.
- All right.
- Can you grab a nail?
- Heal, yeah.
- Ready to watch the first injury.
Help him. Help him.
There you go. There you go.
- Well done.
- Did it hit right in the middle?
- I think so.
- Okay, that's good.
This is a stupid question...
You are from Boston, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Ok.
Things are going really well right now.
It's just such a blessing have Rob here.
With his history in construction
and his having been here
and his laid back approach is really
bringing a lot of harmony to this tribe.
We might as well call it
camp harmony right now.
Just stop us and tell us ***
- You're the pro here.
- You guys know what you're doing.
I am so glad that we have
Boston Rob. He's amazing.
I'm just having so much fun with him.
And I feel like a sense of
comfort and I think if Russell
was here, we would all be on
edge, you know, because he's nut.
You know, he would have, Oh.
He would have been crazy.
Hey, guys. Listen.
Because of the size of these beams,
we're going to have the opening
be that way, we were saying,
because that's the water run down,
and we get this whole bank here
protecting us from the wind.
- Why don't you let me do that?
- I don't mind digging.
No, no, it's not about that.
It's the way you're doing it.
If you're going to do it,
put the weight like that.
- Ok.
- All right, knock yourself out.
I mean, pRobably the most
annoying person so far is Phillip.
- Do you want to help dig?
- Yeah, do you need help?
Sure, there are going to be two more
holes over there. I'll just finish here.
I mean, he's just got that
aggressive kind of like,
in your face personality, which,
you know, you just need to be careful
out here because that's the kind of
thing that can just turn people off.
When you hammer, if you strike this
way, like, if you miss this it can go
like that and hit you. If you're going
to hammer this way, put this foot out.
Yeah. I'm with you.
Apparently, my hatcheting
isn't the correct technique,
but I mean, I don't even have the
best aim, so I'm just going at it.
I grew up on a farm so I know how to
use an axe and I know how to hammer.
I think he just likes
playing the father role
a little bit, so just let him do that.
- I think he likes that.
- I know!
You're excited there.
I was just thinking,
it's a good place to be.
I want all of you to come over.
I'm going to tell you
something about myself.
You know, I had to debate whether
or not I was going to tell you,
whether or not I was going to reveal
it, ok? I'm a former federal agent.
I did it for three separate
agencies so when I give you my word,
if I say something,
it's going to be my word.
The other thing is I'm an expert
in analyzing people's behavior.
So I can determine most
of the time whether or not
someone is telling me the truth
or not and that's what I'm going
to be able to do when we finally
merge and we get to the other side.
And I'll tell you, if
that's a friend or not.
- Okay?
- ***
And all I want to say is I've got
seven sisters and I love women, okay?
You made the right move.
One of the best things about Phillip
is the comic relief that's provided
by the fact that he thinks he used
to be a federal agent is, like,
this big secret, like, bombshell
that he has, that he's holding.
You know, it will just blow
everyone's mind if they knew.
It's hilarious. Who cares?
We have a whole basket full
of stuff, and no one is looking
for the hidden immunity idol, the
clue to it which is kind of weird
because don't you think maybe
it's somewhere in the stuff.
- What is your first name?
- Kristina.
Kristina. Ok.
I have gone thinking maybe you
could go through this stuff here
and check it out and see if
there's anything useful in in there?
I already did. It's just pieces of
cloth, and there are scissors and yarn,
- and a sewing box.
- ****
Maybe Matt, if Matt wants...
I know you know what's up.
- So go through it.
- I went through it.
Anything? No? Nothing?
I've gone through everything
except this. I can't open it.
Okay, I'll try to keep them
away. See what you can find. Ok?
Everything is really new. Everyone
is trying to get their footing ****
The fact that Rob noticed I was looking
for the clue it worries me a little bit
because I don't want to
come off as this really
aggressive strategizer
and turn people off.
Hopefully he's the only person that
understood what was going on, but...
it drives me crazy. I want it.
- Dude, our tribe, man, we're the bomb.
- Okay.
- Five girls and four guys.
- That's true.
- You know, what I'm saying. So just...
- I'm really good with girls.
- Yeah, so am I...
- We'll work that out.
We've got to keep our eyes open.
I definitely want to
be working together.
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm serious about that.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
But someone with a good work
ethic and on the same page as me...
You got that right.
I heard somebody say to me,
when you look at this game a lot
of people get really super paranoid.
The thing about me and any Sheppard, no.
I mean, Rob is sizing me up. So I
like to think of it like two male lions
they're checking each other out.
They're doing that whole
thing and they're doing
a little dance But there
will come a point...
Okay, where that's going to take over.
I thought this would be a good
time for us to talk a little bit.
- All right.
- I'm going to need your help
keeping those young girls from
not having too much. Look at me...
Rob already said to me you
gotta watch those girls.
- There are more girls here.
- There are.
- It's right.
- He'd be an idiot not to.
Yeah, so... He's going to
try to divide and conquer.
He's going to try to
play me like a fool.
And I'm going to play along. And
I'm going to stick to the girls.
I like you, and definitely there's
something about you that's really solid.
- But...
- I've got a little integrity.
- I do, too.
- In terms of what I tell people.
Absolutely.
And I think you and I
can work together. And...
Yeah, you know what?
I'm totally on board.
- Okay, cool. Ok.
- All right?
Let's go find some logs, all right?
Well, what do you
think about this tribe?
I don't know if we're on the winning
side, to tell you, from the looks of it.
The other team, I'm telling
you, they look more physical.
Russell and I were looking for
the tree mail, and he came up to me
and I got all nervous because
I felt like, oh, prom date.
Who dibring the first
time? What was her name.
- Natalie.
- Who did I bring the second time?
Parvati.
But your speech, Russell,
about how you changed.
It was just... It was so moving to me.
- It was. I believed you.
- Listen...
I believed you. You are a changed man.
You have to get on the right team.
I think we can do something together.
But this is dangerous because
I'm not going to be walking around
- with you that much because you...
- No, I...
- You are that girl.
- I think it's better that you don't.
Me and you, when we get to
the merge, it will be over.
Done.
That's all we gotta
do is get to the merge.
Russell is so sneaky. He was
like, "let's form an alliance. "
Which is great because he made it to
the top three every time he played.
So, of course I said yes.
He said getting the girls.
- Please, God, don't let that happen.
- We don't want that to happen.
We need to get Russell out
of this game immediately.
- Russell is not a threat...
- I disagree completely.
- He's got his hooks in one of them.
- Who does he have his hooks in?
- Stephanie.
- What does he do every time?
- He takes a cute little girl...
- Cute little girl...
And takes her and turns her into the ***
- That's right.
- I won't let that happen.
Yeah, no, I agree with you. I
don't think we can let it happen.
I like david. David
seems like a nice guy, ***
He told me Russell had
his hooks in Stephanie.
Any pros of having Russell
around have quickly evaporated.
He's just going to spread paranoia
and be a cancer to the tribe.
At this point, there's nothing to be
done yet except for the task at hand
which is get Russell
gone as soon as possible.
I don't want to have Rob stick around
that long. I mean, I like the guy.
He's a great guy, but he's
dangerous to have on the tribe.
It looks like greased lightning.
- Just need a little...
- I'm working on.
Dreads.
The guys are in awe of Rob,
and, you know, he's going after
all the young girls because
they're easy pickings.
So whatever I do, I think he's
pRobably who I'm going to try
and focus on really quickly.
If there's an idol out there, if I
at all can do anything to find one,
then I will do it. If anyone
can do it on this tribe, it's me.
My immunity idol antenna have been
on alert since I hit the beach.
Like, I wanted to find
it. I knew it was here.
Even if it stood out in our camp, I
wanted to look around and poke around.
I knew that in order for us to
find it, we had to find landmarks.
Our landmarks were going to be our map.
Sweet. This is awesome. Oh, my goodness.
Rob's good. Rob's good. I'm good, too.
It's going to be fun.
This is going to be fun.
The hidden immunity idols,
I mean, it means power.
I'm pRobably going to tell somebody
about it, but I haven't decided who yet.
But I can make this big giant
splash of a move, and, like,
get rid of Rob tonight if I wanted to.
I really could. The
faster he goes, the better.
He's number one on the
chopping block, in my mind.
- Are you on board?
- Absolute.
Don't say a word.
I'm not going to tell you how
to play the game. Like right now
you decided to do what you wanted
to do and I appreciate that.
And I'm not going to tell
you how to play your game.
If I feel the need to tell
somebody something, I'll do it.
I'm a very processed person
so if you came to me and said:
"Look, we want to form this alliance
and we want you to be a part of it
and we want you to vote out Rob. "
I'm going to hear it for what it
is and then I'm going to step back
and I'm going to go
through how you got there.
It's called corRoboration.
Right now there are three people.
Tell me who the other votes are?
- Phillip, relax.
- Just answer my question.
- I'm sorry we said anything.
- First of all...
answer my wuestion right now you
don't have vote, per three of us.
- You don't know anything.
- You need to inform me.
The fact that you're getting
this at attitude with us.
You don't need to be having
that attitude with us.
- First of all...
- The talking to us like a children.
****
You know what? You need to pipe that.
You need to pipe that
thing about an attitude.
I'm a grown man. I'm 52
years old. I've been around.
I've been an agent like I told
you before and what I learned
throughout my career
is you ask questions.
I don't have any
information to give you.
I don't need two people talking at once.
Okay, I'm sorry. You go, Christine away.
- Thank you so much.
- I'm not allowed to talk
- while you're talking.
- All right, go ahead.
Right now, there are three people.
I'm not going to go up and just
for the hell of it say, "Rob,"
and the rest of them, "Phillip" They've
still got the votes to get me out.
You know, what? Here they come.
We had an agreement to wait and
talk about this until we lost.
- We're your friend here.
- We're done.
We're done with this
conversation for now. All right?
I don't know how it happened,
how diget stuck with the old
annoying guy in the
droopy fuchsia briefs.
He's such a pain in my ass.
Did I mention that we're
in an alliance together?
How awesome.
Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to
your first immunity challenge?
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
Here's how it works. On
my go, each tribe will push
four blocks along the track
to build the base of a temple.
You'll then run up the steps,
where one person will use an axe
to chop a series of ropes,
releasing another set of steps.
You'll then make your way to
the top, where you will race to
complete a block puzzle,
completing your temple.
First tribe to get it right wins
immunity, is safe from the vote.
Losers go to tribal council, where
somebody will be the first person
voted out and the first person
sent to Redemption Island.
This is what you want right here.
This little statue guarantees
your safety in this game.
When you're in possession of
immunity, you can't be voted out.
Without it, you are vulnerable.
In addition, the winning tribe
wins fire in the form of flint.
All right, give a minute to
strategize, and we'll get started.
All right, here we go!
For immunity and fire.
Survivors ready? Go!
- Go, go, go.
- You've got four blocks.
You've got to get them to
this wall one at a time.
They are very heavy.
Zapatera with a bit of a
lead right out of the gate.
- Keep going.
- Gotta hit the wall. Go!
- Ometepe, you're good.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Let's go, guys. Come on!
- Push on that side.
- Push!
- Everybody's got to work together.
- Go!
- A very deceiving challenge.
It looks like these would just duplied
over these tracks but they don't.
Ometepe slowing down. Zapatera
still with a bit of a lead.
You're good!
- Ometepe dig in! Let's go!
- Push it, baby, push it.
You're good!
Zapatera doing a very good job.
One, two, three.
Strength really making a
difference for Zapatera.
Got it! Push!
- Zapatera has their third block!
- Come on, guys, we got this.
- Ometepe really slowing down.
- Go!
- Keep digging!
- Push!
Go!
- Let's go, Ometepe.
- Come on, guys.
- Push!
- Let's catch them.
- Come on, keep going.
- Come on guys, push!
- Go, go, go!
- Drive!
- Go.
- Push!
- Zapatera, you're good.
- Go.
Ometepe has their last block.
They have fallen behind.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, go, go, go.
- Ralph working on the rope now.
- Come on, Ralph!
Ometepe completely out of it right now.
- Come on!
- Ralph not waste anything time.
- Zapatera with a big lead.
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go, go.
- Keep it going.
Keep going. Come on now, don't quit.
You want to see the pattern
on the outside of this puzzle.
You want the soiled
colors to be on the inside.
The bottom corner. ****
Ometepe still pushing their last block.
You're good. Let's go, Ometepe.
Come on, Matt, come on!
Matt working on the ropes for Ometepe.
- Go, go, go.
- You better pick it up, brother!
- There you go, Matt.
- Keep going.
- Here!
- Let me.
Zapatera working on their
puzzle with a big head start.
Okay, we got this, come on.
Matt working his way trough
those ropes. He's got one left.
There it is! Let's go!
You're still in this!
Come on, baby!
Ometepe has a great puzzle maker in Rob.
Is Rob strong enough
to bring his tribe back?
- Tell us what to do.
- ***
- David bark the orders for Zapatera.
- This one good goes right here.
Rob is leading Ometepe, as expected.
Help me get this out.
Ometepe is not panicking.
They're working together.
- Perfect.
- Hey!
Zapatera had a gigantic
lead. And it is gone.
Guys, guys, we got this. Stay in it.
Russell, Russell got it.
Ok. I'm listening to him.
Russell is now calling the shots.
It is Russell and Boston Rob.
This is where patience and
experience comes into play.
Come get this piece.
Nobody wants to go to
tribal council tonight.
Nobody wants to go to Redemption Island.
- ***
- Look, look, look.
- This could be a very close finish.
- Come on, come on!
Russell slides in another
piece. Are they right?
- Yeah!
- Zapatera wins Immunity!
Yes, baby! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
One, two, three! Zapatera!
Congratulations, Zapatera.
First immunity win.
Nobody going home from Zapatera,
in addition fire will
get a whole lot easier.
Zapatera, grab your
stuff. Head back to camp.
All right, Ometepe,
tribal council tonight.
Somebody from your tribe will be the
first person voted out of this game,
the first person sent
to Redemption Island.
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp. I will see you at tribal.
We are stronger than they are.
We're faster than they are.
We're smarter than they are.
I know how Boston Rob thinks.
Right now, he's thinking oh, crap.
I'm stuck with a bunch of weenies.
Yeah, so we lost the first
challenge today, which totally sucks,
and in a way, like, I don't know if
other people feel this way, but, I feel
like we let Rob down. It's weird, but
you want to please your leader, I guess.
But it sucks we have to go
to tribal council tonight.
- I just want to tell you.
- Okay.
- I have a hidden immunity idol.
- How is that possible?
- I found it.
- Where?
- I just found it.
- When did you get a clue?
I didn't get a clue. I
found it without a clue.
But, listen, what I think
we should do, after carefully
thinking about everything, I don't
know if we can trust the girls.
I think we should get all
the money to vote for me.
You, me, and big mouth
over there all vote for Rob.
And they try and vote me
out, and I'll play the idol,
- and boom, like this whole game turns.
- Yeah, wow. You have the idol?
Yeah. Okay? So I don't want
to talk to you too long.
But I think this is our only option.
I was totally shocked that Kristina
had the idol, but I'm amazed
and it's totally made my day.
So she's really, she was really excited
about using it to blindside Rob tonight.
And as much as it is, like, a
fun and that would be amazing
and feel really awesome in the
moment, he is a strong competitor,
and we still need him.
It's your immunity idol so, you
know, whatever you want to do.
But I think that Natalie
is the weakest one.
I think that if we do Rob tonight,
everyone is going to be pissed off.
We don't have numbers.
It's still just you me, it's
still just you, me, and Phillip.
That doesn't get us anywhere.
I'm going to do what you want to do.
I just want you to think about it.
I don't want us to committed right now
just because, really think about it.
All right, tentatively we'll do Natalie.
Let me pond her for a few minutes.
Think about it. We have time. Just
know you're not going home tonight.
Yeah, I know I'm not going home tonight.
That I've known for a while.
Voting Natalie is better for the
tribe. Voting Rob is better for me.
There are so many different ways to go.
But, I would love to vote Rob
off tonight. I would love to.
I would just love to. Just
like... Neah! You know.
Hey, who are you guys
thinking of voting for tonight?
I don't know.
- I'm open to discussion.
- We'll talk about it.
All right.
Originally, I wanted
to vote Francesca off
because the very first time I met her,
she stood up on the mat,
looked at Jeff, and said,
"I don't want to play with
him because he's too sneaky. "
She knows my game so I don't want
someone like that on my tribe.
But after thinking about it some more,
the second we landed on our beach,
Kristina was the one looking
through all the supplies,
looking for the hidden
immunity idol. She's dangerous.
She knows strategy. She knows
to get out there and work for it.
To me, I don't need
someone like that with me.
I'll tell you this, the
second we landed on the beach,
Christine athe first thing she did,
she was looking through the sewing kit.
- I know, that's what I thought.
- I wouldn't put it past her to have it?
- To have it?
- I think they have it.
I think they have it, and even
if they don't, there's no reason
why we shouldn't split the vote
and be safe, you know what I mean?
The guys are voting for
Francine. Yeah, Francesca.
We're voting for Fran. You
guys are voting for Christine.
Does everybody understand
that? I got so screwed
last season because one
person didn't understand.
Go through it again.
- Don't let anybody try to, like...
- Bamboozle you.
Yeah, that's it. This is us. That's it.
- We're good.
- Oh my God!
When you're in this, what I
call the hyper state of arousal,
When you're in a survivor
environment, you're losing weight,
you're thirsty, you're
suffering from dehydration,
things can sometimes flare
up, and what have you.
But I realize I still
haven't gotten the answer they
originally said to you, as well as
to Francesca, which is I'm with you,
if I know who that other votes are...
All right, Phil, come on. Come
here. I've got something to show you.
- No, no.
- Come on, come on.
All right, show me.
- Okay.
- You don't need the votes.
We've got them right here.
You know what this means?
This is the hidden immunity idol.
What it means is that yours,
mine, and Francesca's votes
will decide who goes
home. Do you understand?
I'm extremely nervous telling
Phillip about the idol.
He came up to me and said, "I've
done my analytical thing, and we
don't have the votes", I didn't want
him to switch or do something weird.
I don't know, I don't trust the guy,
and that's why I hated telling him.
I just felt I had to tell him.
I didn't have a choice there.
He had to get some reassurance, that
he has some power here in this game.
With your brain and, like, the
way you think, and, I mean, just
you helping me and we could
go all the way if we wanted to.
- You know, like, you have my support.
- Okay, cool.
- All right.
- Another hug.
Hopefully he'll just keep a
lid on it. That was a risk.
He can't handle the information.
He can't keep it on the downlow.
He's a spaz about it.
He's a spaz about everything, if
you really want to know the truth.
Oh, god.
In the tribe's best interest,
it may not necessarily be
the best interest to get rid of Rob.
But is it in the interest of Phillip
Sheppard and company who came to play
a game and make some bold moves.
And I think the longer Rob is
around and solidifying those girls
and that whole thing, I'm weakened,
and so I need to get rid of him now.
Good-Bye, Rob. And you're
looking at the new leader.
Of our tribe.
Behind each of us is a torch. Go ahead
and grab a torch and approach the flame.
Dip it in and get fire.
This is part of the ritual of
tribal council, because in this game,
fire represents your life.
When your fire's gone, so are you,
with a slight exception this season,
Redemption Island,
which we will talk about.
All right, Rob, what happens
when you first get to camp?
Right to work. Right
away. Phillip set the tone.
Everybody's pitching in.
And we've got a pretty damn good
shelter built the first night.
So, Phillip, did you just naturally
assume the leadership role?
Not necessarily the leadership
role, but if I see work
that needs to be done, I'll suggest it.
So, Matt, is Phillip the
leader for now around camp?
I mean, if you're
doing something that is
counter-productive,
he'll call you out on it.
And it's not well received
on the very first day.
Francesca, let's talk
about the different reasons
you might vote someone out tonight.
We need to keep the tribe as
physically strong as possible.
And so, that implies that
a woman is going to go, but,
I mean, we're going to have
to wait and see what happens.
Kristina, how are you feeling
tonight going into the vote?
I don't feel safe at all.
I have my stuff right
here because there's
a very good possibility
I'm going to go home.
Rob, a lot of talk about
the guys having a free pass.
I would put an asterisk
next to your name.
Of course.
It could be me walking away, and
there's nothing I can do about it,
but that's the game.
Francesca, let's talk
about Redemption Island.
Now when you vote
somebody out, they could
come back to either help or haunt you.
Yeah. It's definitely adding a level of
complexity and it
completely changes the game.
If boston Rob got voted out
tonight, which he's not going to,
but if he did, he
would probably be fine.
We could all feel there's a good chance
he's going to come back into the game.
I have an issue with that
statement she just made because
Francesca and Kristina asked
me to cast my vote for Rob.
- That is not true.
- Excuse me.
- I asked you to...
- Excuse me,
I didn't interrupt you while you spoke.
I want to finish what I was saying.
Kristina, did I ask him to vote for Rob?
- Absolutely not.
- Excuse me!
- You are a crazy person.
- Excuse me.
I'm going to interrupt you
Phillip. I don't respect you.
I'm going to say what I want to
say when I want to say it, I'm sorry.
Jeff, I'm a former special agent
so if I make a statement to you
I'll make sure to adhere to
that and I will not betray.
I'll go down on a sinking ship
before I do that until I hear
something different and I
just heard something different
so my vote tonight
will be for Francesca.
- Francesca.
- Francesca.
I don't want Phillip to jump
down my throat now, but Phillip
just kind of had a major
freak out of nowhere and
puts into people's mind that maybe
there's a little instability there.
- Excuse me, you and "Francuesca"
- Francesca.
...approached me to go along with them
because she has an immunity idol.
And that's why they approach me with it,
they took me to it and
they showed it to me.
- So, Kristina, you do have an idol?
- I do have an idol.
- Who is that news to?
- I didn't know.
We didn't know.
So that was the plan, you two were
going to get together and vote me off.
- No.
- Yes, Rob.
I haven't heard you defend yourself.
I had no intention of voting you out,
and Kristina, can you attest to that.
- That's absolutely true.
- Phillip.
I told him that I was
going to vote for you,
but I was actually going
to vote for Natalie.
Excuse me, Rob. You
just heard what she said.
I had no knowledge what
she was really going to do.
And now you're trying
to say I'm unstable.
No, I'm quite rational. And guess what,
I was going to vote for "Francuesca"
- Because that...
- Francesca.
Francesca, my mouth is dry and
I've been getting treatment for it.
I'm done, Jeff, I have
nothing further to add.
- Nothing?
- I'm done with it.
Rob, you have to be sitting
there thinking who do I believe?
Phillip is pretty
adamant about his story.
Francesca has adamantly denied it.
Kristina really hasn't
defended herself at all...
- It was something...
- You haven't.
It was something what we considered.
We would be idiots not to.
But it's not something that
we were going to do tonight.
You have the immunity
idol? Let me see it.
- This is the immunity idol?
- Yes.
- And you're saying that he's lying.
- Yes.
Okay, give me the immunity
idol and you'll stay.
Give me the immunity
idol, and you'll stay.
Why should I trust you and
more than you should trust me.
I can't do that.
I'm just saying by
you not giving it to me
it makes me think that
you're not telling the truth.
- That's ridiculous.
- It's yours.
Obviously, somebody's lying.
So you have an idol and it may
save you for three more days.
But... I'm going to do what I said
I was going to do with the people
that I said I was going to
do it with. And that's it.
This has been one was most
amazing tribal councils.
I have absolutely no idea
what is about to go down.
Let's get to the vote.
Andrea, you're up.
Man, it feels so good to
play with you amateurs.
You give away so much.
You don't even know enough
to keep your mouth shut.
Thanks for the memories.
You might make it through this tribal
council, but probably not the next one.
I had planned on voting for
you or Boston Rob tonight, but
your crazy outburst has spared
Natalie. I hope to never see you again.
I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity
idol, and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once the votes are
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out
will be asked to leave
the tribal council area
immediately. I'll read the votes.
First vote, Kristina.
Kristina. That's two votes Kristina.
Francesca. One vote Francesca.
Phillip. One vote Phillip.
Francesca. Two votes Francesca.
We're tied. Two votes Phillip, two
votes Kristina, two votes Francesca.
Kristina. That's three votes Kristina.
Tied again. Three votes Francesca,
three votes Kristina, two votes Phillip.
One vote left.
First person voted out of
"Survivor: Redemption Island,"
Francesca. You need
to bring me your torch.
Francesca, the tribe has spoken.
You will have a chance
to re-enter this game.
Take your torch. Head
to Redemption Island.
Good-Bye, you guys.
Don't trust Phillip.
Well, good news, flint will be
waiting for you back at camp.
Grab your torches. Head
back to camp. Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
Next time on "Survivor":
Russell meets his match.
I don't like how you are coming at
me. I know how to play this game.
This old boy out here does, too.
And Phillip meets his.
While at Redemption Island, every
week is a fight to stay alive.
This is it, do or die time.
This is the first step in
your journey to get even.
To get a second chance in this game.
Wow. I don't know what to say.
I guess I should have trusted
my instincts from the beginning,
which was, you know, that Phillip
wasn't someone to be trusted.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I don't know when the next
person comes to Redemption Island.
I have no idea what
the duel is going to ***
Oh God!
