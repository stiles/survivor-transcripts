         jeff: Exactly one year ago,
At the finale of "survivor:
Heroes versus villains" boston
Rob challenged russell to a
Rematch.
 given the opportunity, I'd
Gladly go back and kick your
Ass all over the island.
 jeff: This season they got
Their wish.
Boston rob and russell returned








To face each other in the latest
Evolution of "survivor."
Redemption island.
This time around, boston rob, a
Notorious double dealer, tried
Something new-- loyalty.
He made an alliance of six
Ometepe members and stayed with
Them until the end.
 that's it.
This is us.
 jeff: There was grant, his
Right-hand man.
Natalie, the youngest player in








"survivor" history.
Andrea, the hardworking farm
Girl.
Ashley, the nurse who's lately
Proven to be a threat in
Challenges.
Once again, ashley, like she
Grew up doing it.
And the always-unpredictable
Phillip.
Did you have a collision with a
Hawk?
 I had asked for a sign, and
Out of thin air appeared this
Feather.
 jeff: With his army intact,
Rob further strengthened his
Position when he found the
Hidden immunity idol.
 yeah, baby, maybe I learned
Something since last time.
 jeff: He then kept it
Secret for the rest game.
Anyone not in rob's alliance was
Fair game.
Rob saw matt's relationship with
Andrea as a threat.
 I know how strong a pair can
Be in this game.
 jeff: So he blindsided matt
And sent him to redemption
Island.
You will have a second shot to
Get back in this game.
At the first redemption duel--
Matt has all three keys!
Matt beat francesca.
Matt stays alive, and earned the
Right to stay at redemption
Island in hopes of rejoining the
Game.
 god has literally been
Carrying me.
 jeff: His only true
Alliance was with his god.
At the zapatera tribe--
 where is the idol?
 jeff: Russell was up to his
Old tricks, looking for hidden
Immunity idols and make an
Alliance with the youngest girls
On the tribe.
 krista and stephanie, my two
Girls.
 jeff: But the rest of the
Tribe had a few tricks of their
Own.
 you want to throw it?
 miss the bucket.
 jeff: They decided to throw
A challenge.
Ometepe has this nailed.
Julie misses.
 come on, guys, come on.
 jeff: Steve seems to be
Wearing out.
Ometepe wins their first
Challenge!
( cheers and applause )
 ever single one of them let
The challenge go.
I'm dealing with a bunch of
Bitchs.
 jeff: And they voted out
Russell.
 jeff: The tribe has spoken.
At redemption island, russell
Squared off against matt in an
Epic battle of good versus evil.
 this is it.
 jeff: Matt going to give it
A go.
Will it make it?
Matt stays alive!
And in his last moment in the
Game, russell showed that he had
A heart and made a promise.
 this is my last time playing
This game.
That's it.
I have nothing else to prove.
 jeff: Matt won every
Subsequent duel.
Matt stays alive!
And earned his way back into the
Game.
Matt seizes the moment and will
Re-enter this game.
The tribes were then merged.
With ometepe at six-- ometepe!
 jeff: Zapatera with five,
And matt stuck in the middle.
 I want to be in this game as
Long as I can so I'm really just
Trying to figure out what's best
For me and which route to take.
 jeff: He quickly
Reestablished his relationship
With a andrea.
 this is what I want-- I want
To take out the ometepe tribe.
 jeff: But andrea had seen
What happened when you crossed
Rob.
Eighth person voted out of
"survivor: Redemption island."
So they blindsided matt for a
Second time.
 oh, my god, that poor kid.
 jeff: Sending him right
Back to redemption island.
 what the hell, guys.
 jeff: Every single member
Of the former zapatera tribe
Followed matt to redemption
Island, where the duels became
Battles between multiple people,
And mike and matt went on a
Winning streak.
 oh!
 jeff: Mike and matt stay
Alive on redemption island!
While the rest became members of
The jury.
With only former ometepe members
Left to vote out, phillip was an
Obvious target.
 hey!
 jeff: His personality was
Getting on everyone's nerves.
 the thing about me, you open
Up a can of ( bleep ) I will get
Right in there with you and drag
You down in it.
 get out of our faces!
 jeff: But in the end, rob
Decide who was in and who was
Out.
 one man should not have this
Much power in this game.
Luckily, I'm not an ordinary
Man.
 jeff: And andrea found out
The hard way.
 I feel like I'm trusting the
Right people.
 jeff: ...She was out.
Andrea.
 oh, my god.
 jeff: Well, that's one
Blindside.
I have a feeling it won't be the
Last.
Grant also believed his alliance
With rob was rock solid.
 the only person that I really
Truly trust out here is rob
Completely, wholeheartedly.
 jeff: But rob had other
Ideas.
 I didn't come to this game to
Make friends.
I came to this game to win so I
Have to vote your ass off
Tonight.
 jeff: And grant became the
Final person to be support to
Redemption island.
You have a chance to get back in
This game.
 I'm not done.
See you guys shortly.
 jeff: Tonight marks the end
Of this epic season of
"survivor."
Will rob complete the journey he
Began nearly a decade ago?
 I feel like right now, I'm
Playing my best game, but even
Everything that's happened up
Until right now, means nothing
Unless I can fipg of finish it.
 jeff: Or will his loyal
Soldiers turn on him?
 natalie and I, you know,
We've stuck together from the
Beginning, and we could ban
Together and make a huge move
And take out boston rob.
 we trust each other, but, we
All want to win, and so, why
Would we keep rob in the game?
 jeff: Will phillip's antics
Turn out to be part of a genius
Plan to win it all?
 I made myself the villain so
That everyone feels that their
Best chance of winning against
Anybody is me.
But, honestly, I think I can
Defeat rob.
 jeff: And finally, the
Winner of tonight's duel will
Return from redemption island
And re-enter the game.
Who will it be?
Matt, the christian who left his
Game in god's hands.
Mike, the iraq war veteran and
Last zapatera.
Andrea, the only woman left at
Redemption island.
Or grant, the former nfl pro
Betrayed by rob.
It all comes to an end tonight.
Find out who will win the
Million-dollar prize and the
Title of sole survivor.
 I didn't think I was going to
Be voted out.
I trusted the people in my
Alliance.
You know, it turns out, you kn
Know, somebody wasn't being
Honest, and possibly rob betray
Me.
Possibly phillip did.
And you know what?
I'm a-okay, man.
A-okay.
Hi, guys.
 oh!
 grant!
 hi, everybody.
 you can go-- go back through
There and come--
 grant, you're the one I least
Wanted to come because it's
Going to be like a stacked duel.
Grant was probably the person I
Least wanted to show up at
Redemption island.
And sure enough he shows up.
I mean it's grant, matt, mike,
And I.
So it's not going to be an easy
Duel.
I'm going to be, like, the
Under-under-dog.
You know what?
Throw it at me?
 fire's still going.
No rain.
 that was a tough one, you
Guys.
 yeah, it was hard.
 that really touched me.
But we did what we had to do and
It was great.
 I'm all right.
It sucks.
 I know it's tough I'm sure
He's not happy right now, but
What's done is done.
You know?
It stings a little bit, but...
That's the game.
Tonight at tribal council, grant
Got sent to redemption island.
The irony is that it's
Completely my fault that he's
Done.
But at the same time, I miss him
Because grant was a friend of
Mine out here.
As much as I like to think I'm a
Cold-hearted, calculating
Player, it still does get me a
Little bit, you know.
I've got a heart in there
Somewhere.
 he knew he was a huge-- you
Know.
 well, he is.
 he knew that.
 the only thing I'm worried
About is because now I'm the
Huge threat.
You know what I mean?
I think grant might be the only
Person on redemption that can
Come back here and me actually
Want to vote them out next.
If it's matte, mike, or andrea
Eye I don't know, ashley's no
Good.
She's got to go.
That's in my gut.
You know.
She's got to go.
Bye-bye, ashley.
 I feel so great right now.
I mean, I love this place.
It's just-- it's become home to
Me.
This is day 29 for me.
I remember coming here that
First night, and it raining,
Thinking, how am I ever going to
Get through this?
I was extremely bitter and upset
And angry, but, you know, those
Feelings came to pass because
This is just a special place.
 all right, oh!
 this is your final!
 ya!
 whoo-hoo!
 I hope it's a pizza.
 "this is it, your final duel.
When it is over only one of you
Will return to the game.
The rest of you will join the
Jury."
 dig deep, we're digging.
 "this one of require you to
Dig deep."
 let's bring it back, andrea.
 dig deep.
 it's the final one!
 all right!
 all right!
 turns out today is our last
Duel.
Three will fall, three will if
Home, one will remain and
Re-enter the game.
I've had about 14 days out here
On redemption island and a
Little piece of me is going to
Miss redemption island.
It's been a life-changing
Experience out here.
You guys, you made it.
Matte, you're last--
 your last duel.
 it's bittersweet.
Redemption island is wrapping
Up, but it's going to be great
Knowing our fate one way or
Another.
I mean, the redemption island
Purgatory is coming to-- coming
To an end.
 dear lord, thank you so much
For this morning.
Thank you for redemption island
And what it's done and meant to
All of us.
Help us to dig as deeply as we
Can but know that your will is
Perfect and have peace with
Whatever the outcome is, lord.
Thank you so much for your son
And we love you.
A men.
 a men.
 two blindsides, seven days in
The actual game of "survivor,"
11 duels, 29 days on redemption
Island.
That's pretty unbelievable.
God deserves all the glory and
All the credit.
My faith has grown.
I've grown as a person.
I mean, who knew what treasure
Awaited on redemption island.
 jeff: We'll now bring in
The competitors for today's
Final duel.
Matt, mike, andrea, and grant.
Welcome to redemption island
Arena for your final duel.
Phillip, rob, ashley, natalie
Are all here to witness this
Duel because, clearly, they have
A vested interest in the
Outcome.
Here's how it works-- you will
Place your foot on one end of a
Balancing board.
On the other end is a ceramic
Vase.
When the vase falls, you're out
Of the challenge.
You're out of the game.
Last person left standing with
Their vase intact rejoins this
Game and their shot at the
Money.
Lose and you are out and will
Become the fifth, sixth, and
Seventh member of the jury.
This is it.
One last shot.
Take your spots.
All right, here we go.
Final duel.
Place a foot on the end of the
Board and release.
And just like that, we are on.
Very simple challenge.
Keep that vase balanced at the
End of your board.
When your vase drops off, you're
Out.
You've now been balancing these
Vases for 20 minutes.
Grant with a nice recovery.
Close call for matt.
Mike with a nice recovery.
Wake up, wake yourself up.
Remember what we're doing here.
You've been up there 40 minutes
Now.
Grant trying to stretch out that
Leg.
 oh!
 jeff: Grant's vase drops.
Grant is out of this game.
Grant becomes the fifth member
Of the jury.
We are now down to three, matt,
Mike, and andrea.
One hour you've been balancing a
Vase on the end of a board.
Andrea stretching it out.
And with that, matt is out of
This challenge and out of this
Game.
After 36 days in this game.
 wow!
 jeff: You survived 10
Duels, but fell short when you
Needed it most.
Matt is the seth member of the
Jury, has no shot at winning,
And we are down to two.
Mike and andrea in a showdown.
A tough farm girl taking on the
Iraq war veteran, the winner
Gets back in this game.
Mike nice recovery.
Andrea with a nice recovery.
Just make sure you're staying
With your mind on what you're
Doing.
Mike drops his vase.
 mike, good job, buddy.
 jeff: Andrea stays alive
And will re-enter this game and
Continue her quest for the
Million-dollar prize and the
Title of sole survivor.
 hell of a joblg, matte.
 good job, matt.
 hell of a job.
 jeff: Andrea, you had to be
The biggest underdog coming into
This challenge.
You did it.
You're back in this game.
Grant, 36 days.
Came up just a little short.
You become the fifth member of
The jury.
Take your buff off.
Put it in the urn.
We'll see you at tribal council.
 keep it going, you guys.
 take care, man.
 fell a little short on day
39, but you know what?
There are gifts out here, and in
Any experience that if your eyes
Are open, you can see them.
I feel I have accomplished that.
I'm proud of the work I've done
On myself.
I'm proud of the fact I was able
To see those things.
Mission accomplished.
 jeff: Matt, you no longer
Have a shot at the money, but
You, too, will have a say in who
Wins this game.
Matt, you become the sixth
Member of the jury.
Take off your buff.
Put it in the urn.
I'll see you at tribal council.
 you got it.

( applause ).
 burn, baby.
See you all later.
 see you.
 36 days in the game and 29
Days on redemption island, god
Was with me every step of the
Way, and I think his will was
Ultimately done, and-- and I
Praisehis name for just letting
Me be a vessel for him.
That's been my reward for all
The struggle and all the
Strife that I've been through.
 jeff: Mike, you're the
Seventh member of our jury.
Take off your buff, toss it in
The urn.
See you at tribal.
 thanks, guys.
See you.
Today's outcome was not what I
Wanted.
I wanted to get back into the
Game, try to be the sole
Survivor.
But it wasn't meant to be, and
That's all right.
 jeff: Andrea,
Congratulations.
 thank you.
 jeff: You are in the final
Five.
Four of you, come on down.
Phillip, rob, natalie and
Ashley.
The five of are you back
Together again.
Slightly different situation
This time.
So, andrea, you're back in this
Game with the people who
Blindsided you.
Do you feel like you're a part
Of this foursome, now a
Five-some?
 not really.
I think that I need to really
Prove myself and I need to do
Well at challenges.
I mean, obviously, I'm going to
Still try to work strategy and
See what's going on, but I mean,
Right now I feel like it's a
Very individual game.
 jeff: All right, grab your
Stuff.
Head back to camp, and await
Word of your next challenge.
Good luck.
 thank you.
 the way I see it, between
Phillip andrea, ashley, natalie,
If I have t,I have to vote for .
As long as ashley doesn't win
Immunity tomorrow, andrea gets
To stay one more day.
 it was awkward coming back to
Camp.
I mean, I've been gone.
They voted me out.
I came back.
 great job knocking them dead.
 thank you.
 you did a great job.
 good job.
 they're not necessarily happy
To see me.
 now it's over.
 good.
 no more redemption.
It's really awkward.
 yeah.
 I didn't feel completely
Welcomed, but then again, I was
Voted off, so why would I?
Right now, I need, you know, to
Try anything because otherwise
If I just sit back, I'm going to
Be the next to go.
 I talked to those people at
Redemption island.
They basically called us like,
Puppets.
They said, "rob and his little
Girl puppets."
And I was like oh, okay.
 I told natalie, ashley, you
Know, some people were thinking
Of voting for phillip, which is
A lie.
I was making up this random
Stuff.
I'm just trying to plant the
Seed.
Now that I'm back in the game
It's like, okay, now I get back
To the grindstone.
 if andrea wins immunity,
We're getting rid of phillip,
Right, not me?
 yeah!
 because I know rope wants to
Keep phillip around.
 that doesn't even mean a
Thing.
 it's the three of us, so...
 that's what we think.
 you can't trust rob so much.
I'm definitely glad andrea's
Back.
I feel like, you know, rob
Already burned her once.
You know, I don't think she's
Going to trust him again, and
Maybe she'll join with natalie
And I, and kind of try to take
Phillip or rob out.
 just focus on relaxing today,
And then figuring it all out
Tomorrow.
 yeah.
 to me.
So I'm sure to you she's saying,
"if andrea wins immunity, rob
Must go."
 it.
 and they were laying up all
Three of them together for a
Long time.
 we have to watch out, three
Girls together.
I mean, it's danger.
Ashley drives me nuts.
But her tactics are so amateur
Hour.
Natalie's a good-hearted little
Soul, one that's loyal.
And I don't like to see someone
Corrupt my soldier.
 we just need to make them
Think that andrea's going home.
 yes.
 I can't wait to vote her
Ass out.
I can't.
37 days.
It's like patience is going to
Finally pay off and it's going
To be that much sweeter.
 jeff: Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to today's
Immunity challenge?
 we are.
 jeff: First things first,
Ashley.

Vote tonight.
Guaranteed a one-in-four shot at
Winning this game.
Overwhelming?
 definitely is.
Uh, yeah.
I'm kind of at a loss for words.
That was a big one.
And just really excited, jeff.
 jeff: As for the rest of
You, phillip, natalie, boston
Rob, andrea, after 37 days in
This game, tonight one of the
Four of you will be voted out
And join the jury.
Going to be an interesting
Afternoon figuring out what this
Tribe that's been together so
Long is going to do.
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
I will see you at tribal.
 I am on the chopping block
But it would make so much more
Sense to vote out rob now that
He hasn't won immunity and keep
Me.
I'm really relying on the girls
To do something in the game.
This really is actually an
Opportunity for them and
Hopefully they'll be able to see
It.
 I'm so excited I won.
I kind of wish that this
Challenge was tomorrow's
Challenge leading into the final
Tribal council.
But I at least know that I'm
Here to compete again.
 okay, let's all go talk.
 let's go talk.
The four of us need to talk.
 ashley won.
So andrea goes home.
Sorry, andrea, you're next.
 that's all right.
I'll be here.
An.
 andrea's actually worked hard
This game.
She's been helpful around camp.
She has a good relationship with
People on the other side.
Seems like a no-brainer to get
Rid of her.
 I just wanted to know--
 so it's her?
 it definitely is here.
 I just want us four, you
Know, to continue.
 let's vote andrea's ass off.
 another cool.
 cool.
There are no idols after
Tonight, and it's the last time
I can use my idol.
I don't even need the idol.
If I decided, you know what, I'm
Going to go fishing.
I don't have anything to worry
About.
I'm not going home tonight.
 I just want to make sure that
We vote andrea out, that it's
Not me next time, it's phillip
100% phillip.
I feel like rob is trying to
Keep phillip around this whole
Time so, like, when it comes
Down to it, he's going to, like,
Keep him till the end.
 I'm just frustrated because I
Feel like the same way, like,
There could be a possibility,un.
You never know he's telling me
He's keeping you, but, you know,
You just never know.
 you can promise me 100% that
Your vote will go towards
Phillip next time?
 yes, I promise.
 like, you won't vote for me.
 right.
 it's always been me and you.
 I know.
 it doesn't need to, like,
Stop now.
 I know.
 thank you.
 thank you.
 love you.
 love you.
 ashley and natalie went down
In the woods and talked forever,
It seemed like.
So I thought, oh, my goodness.
These girls are going to get
Together.
And I went into my old special
Agent mode.
When boston rob got back from
Fishing, I did what I told him
I'd do.
I called him over and gave a
Report.
They went back there when you
Went in the water and they
Talked forever.
They stood right there on the
Edge and spoke for, like, 10
Minutes.
I can't believe it was only
About voting andrea out.
 what is going on?
This is so ridiculous.
 I thought it was very odd.
Now she's listening to my entire
Conversation right here.
 it's really weird things
Happening.
Rob and phillip in front of me
Are openly talking.
I can hear them.
 and I'm going to tell you
That, they were talking for 10,
15 minute.
Let's go for a walk.
 there is a lot of madness
Going on.
So there's a chance that
Something could get mixed up.
 this is, like, confusion
Going on right now.
And I don't know why.
 while the boys are gone, I
Decided that I wanted to talk to
The girls and try to get in with
Them because I feel like I have
More leeway with them.
 have you guys pretty much
Made your decision?
 no.
 if you think about it, I
Wouldn't want to be up against
Rob in the finals.
Like, even though,un, he's
Played.
People are going to vote for
Him.
Like I actually wouldn't want to
Be up against him, either.
 hold on.
I'm so confused, bro.
 okay.
 what happened?
 okay--
 they went in the woods.
 then they got up and went and
Got in bed.
 it makes a lot more sense to
Get rid of one of them.
 like, I've been to redemption
Island, and I talked to those
People.
They're not going to vote for
You guys.
They're going to vote for rob.
And that's coming straight from
All those people from
Redemption.
 I want you to know they did
Talk for a very long time in the
Woods.
 okay.
 I'm probably going to vote
Rob.
One vote.
We have three votes.
That could do anything.
If we got rid of him, then it's
Us three and phillip.
We can decide if we want to take
Girls or him.
 chances are, going up against
Rob, you know, you're not going
To win.
So it's tough because you have
To make a decision, and people
Are not going to be happy with
You.
It's not fun, but it is a game,
And, you know, life must go on.
 okay.
 does that make sense?
 that makes sense.
 you follow that, okay.
 I got phillip telling me the
Girls are in the woods talking.
Thanks, phillip, welcome to day
37.
I've played this game four
Times.
Do these guys not realize that?
Do they not realize that I can
Pretty much predict what they're
Going to do and say before they
Actually do it.
 I think it's a good idea.
It's just really, really risky.
It would be us three girls in
The finals.
 let's do it.
I can still dictate this vote.
I don't even need the idol.
As long as I have natalie.
I could take it home as a
Souvenir, too.
What can I say?
I like to gamble.
God I'm sick.
I'm so sick.
 jeff: We'll now bring in
The members of our jury.
David.
Julie.
Steve.
Ralph.
Grant.
Matt.
And mike.
Rob, played this game a lot.
Where does this rank right now
In terms of the paranoia?
 it's pretty high.
People pulling me here and
Pulling me there.
A lot of talking.
A lot of different stories.
 jeff: Phillip, were you a
Part of those discussions?
 absolutely.
Obviously, you've forgotten my
Title it's undercover
Specialist.
 jeff: Were you successful
In your mission?
 if you want me to be
Perfectly clear about it, I
Could be.
You know, I will be, actually.
 I asked phillip to keep his
Eyes and ears open if he heard
Anything about me getting voted
Off.
 jeff: And that would mean
The three women.
That's all that's left.
 right.
 jeff: Ashley, surprise you
That rob's asking fill turnpike
Keep his ears open?
 it doesn't surprise me.
Rob knows he's a strong
Competitor, and he's had a
Target on him since day one,un.
He's boston rob.
Who wouldn't want to take him
Out?
 jeff: Andrea, got to be
Tempting.
Three women.
Two guys.
That's an easy one.
 you know, that's kind of the
Line I was thinking.
So I went up to the girls and I
Said, "this jury is a very
Intelligent jury.
They know who's pulling the
Strings here.
They know who is actually
Playing a strategic game, and so
Far, you guys haven't done
Anything strategic.
This is an opportunity to
Actually take control of the
Game."
Whether or not they actually can
See that and actually gain some
Respect from the jury is up to
Them.
 jeff: So, natalie, was some
Something you were receptive to
Considering?
 definitely, rob is a huge
Threat.
I have to consider all
Possibilities to get me the
Furthest.
 jeff: Rob, you blindside
Andrea.
She went to redemption and took
Out matt, grant, and mike.
She's, clearly, a powerhouse in
This game.
 she showed it again in the
Challenge today.
I mean, she was right behind
Ashley.
She's a hard worker around camp.
She's likable by everyone.
It makes her a real threat to
Sit with at the end.
 jeff: All right, it is time
To vote.
Tonight is the last night you
Can play a hidden immunity idol
If you have one.
Ashley has the immunity
Necklace.
You cannot vote for her.
Everybody else is fair game.
Phillip, you're up.
 rob, you're a great player
And my biggest competition so
That's why I'm voting for you
Tonight.
 jeff: I'll go tally the
Votes.
If anybody has the hidden
Immunity idol and you want to
Play it, tonight is the last
Night you can do so.
 you know what?
My mother always told me better
To be safe than sorry.
Here you go.
 jeff: This is the hidden
Immunity idol.
Any votes cast against rob will
Not count.
Once the votes are read, the
Decision is final.
The person voted out will be
Asked to leave the tribal
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, rob.
Does not count.
Andrea.
Andrea.
That's two votes andrea.
16th person voted out.
Andrea.
That's three.
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Andrea, once again, the tribe
Has spoken.
Time for you to go.
 all right.
 jeff: Well,
Congratulations.
You have made it to the final
Four.
Tomorrow you will compete in
Your final immunity challenge.
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.
Try to get some sleep.
 the girls could have done
Something tonight.
They could have made a move.
And actually have a little more
Respect from them.
I think coming back from
Redemption island after winning
A big duel put a pretty big
Target on my back but I'm happy
For how far I got.
I had a great opportunity, great
Experience, met some wonderful
People and I wouldn't change it
For the world.
 the final four!
 final four!
 congratulations.
 guys.
 I didn't know rob had the
Immunity idol but I suspected
All along.
I think he played that
Brilliantly.
 good job.
 yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I feel so special, man.
 we did it.
 a little weird.
I can't believe it.
I'm in the final four.
We did what we said we were
Going to do-- stealth are us.
 last two girls standing.
 andrea tried to throw me and
Natalie under the bus and say
That neither of us had made big
Moves in this game but it's
Funny because she's not here
Anymore, and I am.
So I get the last laugh when all
Is said and done.
 I think I might have to go
For water.
 nat, we're all in this
Together till the end, the three
Of us?
 we're all in this together.
 and that's it.
 promise.
Promise, prospect.
 100%.
 I'm going to win tomorrow,
And then I'm going to take you
Two, all right promise phillip
Doesn't get in there.
I, obviously, have the most to
Lose here.
10 years, four times on
"survivor," 116 days, one
Challenge, for one million
Bucks.
That's what it comes down to.
It's pretty big stakes.
 jeff: Come on in, guys!
You guys ready to get to your
Final immunity challenge?
First things first, ashley.
Give it up.
For the last time, immunity is
Back up for grabs.
For today's challenge, you will
Race through a giant maze
Collecting four bags of puzzle
Pieces.
Once you have all four bags,
You'll race to the tom and use
Those pieces to solve a word
Phrase.
First person to get it right
Wins immunity, is guaranteed a
Spot at the final tribal council
Where you will get a chance to
Plead your case.
Why you deserve the title of
Sole survivor and the million
Dollars that goes with it.
Losers, tribal council.
Somebody will be voted out of
This game, and after 38 days,
You will fall one day short.
Huge stakes.
We'll draw for spots and we will
Get started.
All right, here we go.
For immunity and a guaranteed
Spot at the final tribal
Council, survivors ready?
Go!
It is a complicated maze.
There will be a lot of dead

Out of this challenge.
 let's work together.
 yeah.
 I don't have anything yet.
You?
 jeff: Very unusual on day

A million dollars.
To work with someone else.
Nothing?
 no.
 jeff: You can work together
All you want.
Only one person will win
Immunity.
Only one person will have that
Necklace tonight at tribal
Council.
 safe...
 jeff: Rob is saying he's
Got nothing going.
Ashley still saying she's got
Nothing going.
The only question is, are they
Telling each other the truth?
Rob changing it up.
Trying new patterns now.
New combinations of letters.
Rob starting to put some words
Together.
Is he right?
"only you are safe."
He is.
 yeah!
 jeff: Rob mariano wins
Final immunity.
 yeah!
 give me a hug!
 good job.
 congratulations.
 I found three of the bags.
I couldn't find that u leasive
Fourth one.
 good job phillip.
 good job, ashley.
 jeff: Boston rob, come on
Over.
( applause )
When you needed it, you got it.
 thank you.
 that was beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.
 good job.
 jeff: Rob, safe tonight at
The final tribal council.
This means are you guaranteed a
Spot at that final tribal
Council where you will get a
Chance to plead your case about
Why after four times playing,
You deserve to win.
The big question this afternoon,
Who's going home?
Who's going to the final?
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
I'll see you at tribal tonight.
 thanks.
 jeff: Congrat.
 thanks.
 it was amber that encouraged
Me to come back and try again.
She believes in me.
It's because of her.
Like, whatever happens now, I'm
Okay.
Even if I don't win.
Which is ironic because the only
Reason I ever wanted to come
Back to play again was to win.
But, I feel like I did my best.
But I'm not done yet.
First of all, figure out which
One of these other three idiots
I'm going to send home tonight,
And then how I'm going to
Convince the other people
Sitting on the jury to give me a
Million dollars.
After my wife's already won one.
 no mor more chnlz!
Way to go, rob.
 way to nail it, man.
You did it, you did it.
 basically at this point I
Just want to make ashley and
Phillip both the feel like
They're going to the finals with
Me.
Tonight, someone get the final
Blinded side.
The problem is, if I want to get
Rid of ashley, I have to get
Natalie on board.
And that's going to take some
Work.
So don't sweat anything.
All right?
 we're all good, though?
 yeah, we're good.
Don't sweat nothing.
 all right.
 hey.
 yeah?
 don't say anything to him.
 no.
 are you gonna tell him?
 no, he's going to freak out
If I do.
 he'll think it's me.
 yeah, he's going to freak
Out.
 I think that's a better
Decision.
 I think so, too.
 I feel really, really
Confident.
Rob has told me, like, don't
Sweat anything.
Don't worry.
You know, phillip thinks it's me
Going home tonight.
And I have such a good
Connection with natalie that I
Know, even if something did
Change and I was the one going
Home, I know natalie would at
Least tell me.
So I feel confident going into
Tonight's tribal but always that
5% that you never know.
 awu, you have to pretend like
I'm going home,"nat.
That's sad.
You'd let me know if you heard
Anything.
You'd let me know if you heard
Anything.
 ashley?
 I know.
But I'm just saying.
 promise you.
 so it's day 38.
We're going into the final
Tribal council.
And we will be voting out
Phillip.
So I can't wait to spend the day
Tomorrow with rob and ashley.
Phillip-free.
 it's just kind of scary.
 I know but you shouldn't be
At all.
 I know.
 how's she saking it?
She suspect that she's going?
 she thinks it's you.
 let her continue to think
That.
I have seven sisters.
None of them as lazy as that
Girl right there.
 yeah.
She is in a league of her own.
 rob hasn't, like second
Guessed anything at all?
 never.
 he has immunity.
Why would he.
 don't worry.
There's no need to.
 the other problem with ashley
Is that while the zapatera
People were here, she got
Awfully close to a lot of them.
And probably created some bonds
That would come to haunt me in
The final tribal council with
Her and natalie.
So, pretty much, I have to try
To convince natalie to vote off
Ashley.
She's not going to like it.
It's ashery.
And, ultimately, she may not go
Along with the plan.
 it's part of the game that
Suction, natalie.
I know.
 but why?
 she has way too many friends
On the jury.
It just can't happen.
I made a promise to you in this
Game that I'd get you to the
End, and I will.
It has to happen this way.
It's hard.
I know.
You've got to be strong here,
Though, for the next couple of
Hours, all right?
 I thought to myself that rob
Could possibly come to me last
Minute and ask me to vote for
Ashley.
 you can do it.
I know you can.
 it would be really, really,
Extremely tough for me at this
Point, just because we have
Formed such a close bond and--
And I've promised her that it's
The three of us, and assured
Her.
 you've trusted me throughout
This game, right?
I promise I won't let you down.
 I didn't come out here to
Make friends, and I came out
Here, and I did.
 nat?
 yeah.
 did he say anything?
 nope, just... "plan's on."
 he said that?
 rob has been watching my back
Since day one.
But then again, at this point, I
Have to look out for myself.
Honestly, like, I would rather
Lose this game than lose a
Friend in ashley.
 jeff: We'll now bring in
The members of our jury.
David, julie, steve, ralph,
Grant, matt, mike, and andrea.
So, rob, when you needed it
Most, you came through, winning
Immunity today.
Ashley, it was neck and neck.
You were right there.
This could be a million-dollar
Loss for you.
 it was a definite bummer,
Obviously.
I knew I had to win that, that
Challenge.
And, uhm, it's really
Disappointing, jeff.
 jeff: So, rob, it's a
Pretty simple scenario right
Now-- you have the necklace.
You're going to the final.
That gives you a really big
Vote.
 ultimately, you want to sit
With the people that you think
That you can beat in the end.
But you don't know how the jury
Is going to react to who you
Vote out and for what reason.
I've been to this point before,
And it didn't work out.
But, ultimately, I can only do
What I can do, and then it's up
To these guys.
 jeff: So, natalie, you had
To have taken a moment today to
Try to plead your case with him.
 I mean, all along, we've been
Together on this, just making
Decisions, and I hope that he
Would want me to stand next to
Him in the end, and, I mean, I
Belong here.
 jeff: What was your pitch,
Phillip, to rob?
 rob knows that I was the
Specialist, and rob is probably
Very concerned that I could beat
Him because I won-- how many
Challenges?
Oh, that's right.
I didn't win any.
 jeff: Ashley, what do you
Say to rob?
Why should he take you?
 you know, I've been loyal to
Rob since day one.
There's been many times that I
Could have thrown him under the
Bus, and I haven't.
You know, I'm just hoping that
He'll carry me through to the
End, but I don't know.
 jeff: Do you think you can
Win this game?
 yeah.
 jeff: Do you think you have
A better shot than natalie or
Phillip?
 yeah.
 jeff: Okay, it is time to
Vote.
You cannot vote for rob.
Everybody else is fair game.
Phillip, you're up.
 I've never known anyone that
Could lay in bed day after day
Each day.
 I can't believe it's taken 38
Days to finally write your name
Down.
I won't miss you.
You're a nut case.
That's it.
 jeff: I'll go tally the
Votes.
Once the votes are ready, the
Decision is final.
Person voted out will be asked
To leave the tribal council area
Immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote, ashley.
Phillip.
Ashley.
Two votes ashley, one vote
Phillip, one vote left.
17th person voted out.
Ashley.
You need to bring me your torch.
Ashley, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Natalie, boston rob, phillip--
You've gone as far as you can go
In this game.
Tomorrow night, nine people that
You had a hand in voting out
Will decide who they think is
Worthyf thele of sole
Survivor and the million-dollar
Yohave one more nit under
The stars of nicaragua.
Try to get se sleep.
I'll see you tomorronight for
Your final triba council.
Congratulations.
 I honestly didn't know I was
Going home.
I probably am an idiot for
Thinng tt bause I was the
Biggest that that rob could
Have taken to the final three.
As much as I would love to be
Sitting there in the final
Three, I still have nothing to
Hang my head about and I'm proud
Of how I played the game, and I
Wouldn't change anything.
 day 39, I finally got to
Experience it for myself, that
Feeling of, wow.
You did it.
Your great-great grandfather
Came to you in a vision and told
You when you had some doubt,
"remain committed.
Hold your faith, and you'll get
To the end."
And I did.
And, so, I thanked him for
Coming to sit a spell with me on
This journey lifet in
"survivor."
Just had some private moment
Where-- private moments of joy,
Being proud, went all the way
I've learned a great deal about
Myself.
I learned that it's okay to tell
The world that I have a
Relationship with somebody
That's been dead since 1870.
It's okay.
And I learned that I can accept
The good, the bad, and the
Different.
That's what's been great out
Here.
So tonight, at the final tribal
Council, the plan is laid in
Stone.
I want to make it clear to the
Jury why they're sitting in the
Jury and why I'm sitting in the
Final.
I need to kind of put a little
Salt on that wound to make sure
Folks don't forget that.
I get the last laugh.
 whooo!
Yeah!
 we made it!
 we made it, baby.
 look at all this food!
 I faced a lot of challenges
Out here, and this was the
Hardest thing that I've ever had
To do in my entire life.
I'm 19, and I just feel like I
Stand for my generation.
 congratulations.
 congratulations.
 p.
 congratulations.
 there's been times of sadness
And doubt, but I made it
Through, and that's what this is
All about.
It's just overcoming your fears.
To get this far, it gives me
Motivation to get back in the
World and do anything that I was
Ever afraid to do, and I
Definitely want to prove myself
To the jury tonight.
But I do feel like I do have a
Shot.
 what did you say to save me
When they were trying to get rid
Of me?
 man, it was a lot of work,
Let me tell you.
 yeah, right.
 every time.
Wow, 39 days in nicaragua, 117
Days total over the last 10
Years.
It's overwhelming.
Winning this game has always
Eluded me.
And, again, I find myself one
Step away from the top, and I'm
Just hoping to get there.
The jury can be funny sometimes.
They try to make me cry, and you
Know what I did last time?
I felt bad.
And I said, "I'm sorry."
And you know what?
Looking back on it.
That's the biggest regret I ever
Had.
I should have stood up and said,
"hey, kiss my ass."
I haven't stopped playing the
Game.
To some people it may look like
I'm giving pointers to natalie,
But I'm actually giving natalie
Poirnlts on how I want her to
Handle tribal council.
You know, I made it all the way
To the end.
The first time the jury didn't
Feel I was worthy.
I'm hoping that tonight, I'm not
Going to screw it up again.
As far as I'm concerned, I've
Done my job.
 I want to say that I was
Never proud to wear
Plumb-colored underwear.
However--
 are you getting rid of those
Things.
 yes.
 I am so glad.
Look at how saggy those things
Are.
 I knew that my manhood was
Not reflect nltd briefs they
Wear.
But, rather, the character that
I bring to the game, and so,
With-- with happiness and joy,
As I approach my destiny, I bid
You adieu.
 thank god!
 thank god!
 now go wash your hands.
 my great-great-great
Grandfather jessum, would
Probably say, "like all good
Things, some things must come to
An end."
And he'd be pleased to see those
Come to an end.
 jeff: We'll now bring in
The members of our jury.
David.
Julie.
Steve
Ralph
Grant
Matt
Mike
Andrea.
And ashley.
Well, natalie, rob, phillip,
Congratulations.
You did what 15 other people
Couldn't do in this game-- you
Made it to the end.
Tonight, the power in this game
Now shifts to the jury.
That's how it works.
Nine people that you voted out
Will decide who they think is
Worthy of the title of sole
Survivor, and the million-dollar
Check that goes along with it.
Here's how it's going to work--
You will each get a chance to
Make an opening statement.
This is your chance to plead
Your case about why you deserve
It.
The jury will then get a chance
To address you, try to elicit
Information to help them make a
Very important decision.
Then we will vote.
All right, let's get started.
Natalie.
You're up.
 okay.
Uhm, I made it 39 days.
I just wanted to come in here
And play the best game they
Could, and I can honestly say
They did that.
My strength in this game was my
Social skills, trying to figure
Out who I wanted to align with.
Luckily, rob and I had an
Alliance from the very
Beginning.
I stuck with his alliance, and
That's how I made it this far,
And I've been loyal, and I, uhm,
I deserve to be here.
I would be the youngest female
Survivor winner if you decided
To vote for me.
 jeff: Phillip.
 I deserve to be here because
When I came in to the game, I
Didn't know that the strategy I
Had put in place was suddenly
Going to be turned upside down
And that's what boston rob got
Off that helicopter.
And I had to revamp my whole
Strategy while I was actually
Playing the game.
I changed my strategy and I went
To boston rob and apologized to
Him because I was going to vote
Him out at that first tribal
Council.
I went to boston rob and I said,
"I'm so sorry."
And I have to say, he send my
Apology.
And I take my hat off to him for
That.
And I can say that I wouldn't be
Sitting here right now if it
Wasn't for boston rob.
I thank him for that.
Additionally, the fact that I
Implemented the whole concept of
The stealth, which allowed our
Tribe to stay together and
Actually devastate the former
Zap tribe.
Boston rob, his true name is the
Mastermind.
He came up with the total
Concept of how we should go
Forward, and I implemented it.
And so I feel that's what got me
Here today, and maintaining my
Loyalty to boston rob.
 jeff: Boston rob.
 all right, first of all,
Guys.
I want to say thanks for just
Giving me the opportunity to
Play with you, particularly
Ometepe.
I think if I was on zapatera,
From the beginning, it may have
Been a dirve story.
The thing I wanted to talk to
You about, I feel like I was
Competitive in the challenges.
I won four individual
Immunities.
Strategically, I did put
Together many alliances,
Including the six people that we
Stuck together.
We all knew that once we got to
Six, it was going to get messy
And I had other suballiance
Within that.
And finally, around camp life, I
Was a hard worker.
And I did my part, but all of
That doesn't matter at all.
What really matters is what you
Guys think.
Because at the end of this, this
Game, it switches, the power,
Like jeff said, from us to you.
So it's what you guys consider
To be successful quality in a
Player.
Another thing that I thought a
Lot about, you know, I've been
Out here for 117 days, basically
10 years on and off.
I've been trying to climb this
Mountain and get to the top of.
And, you know what.
It's almost a third of my life.
Does "survivor" define me?
It's been a huge part of my life
And it's been a huge chapter in
My life and it's a game that I
Love, but it doesn't.
At the end of the day, it's
About my wife and my child.
That's why I'm out here.
I love this game, but
Ultimately, I want to win it so
I can bring something home so
They can have a better future.
So I hope that I played the game
The best in your eyes, and I
Hope you vote for me tonight.
Thank you.
 jeff: All right, jury, in a
Moment, your first chance to
Address natalie, boston rob, and
Phillip.
I'll give you a moment to think
About what you want to say.
 jeff: Al all right, jury,
Finally after 39 long days, you
Will each get a chance to
Address natalie, boston rob, and
Phillip.
The goal is simple-- you're
Looking for information to help
You make a million-dollar
Decision.
Andrea, get us started.
You're up.
 all right.
First of all, I want to start
With phillip.
You are weird.
My question to you, we have seen
A plethora of different
Phillips, you know-- phillipe,
Chef, the special agent-- and it
Makes me wonder, like, who is
The real phillip sheppard?
Go.
 first of all, the reason you
Didn't know who I was is because
I was on the outside of the
Original ometepe tribe.
So, therefore, you're right.
You don't know who I am.
 can you not answer it?
 I'm phillip sheppard.
I gave you my name.
You had 39 days to understand
Who I am.
If you don't, then don't vote
For me.
 thank you.
All right, natalie, I notice
That you had a really
Interesting relationship with
Rob, almost borderline creepy at
Times to some of us.
You were so loyal to him that
You betrayed what I thought was
Jur best friend this entire
Time.
 ashley and I made a great
Friendship out here.
Bit this isn't about
Friendships.
And this is a game, okay.
 so then I guess I'm just
Wondering what is it about rob
And this, like, allure of riding
Coattails that you chose over
Ashley?
 I just think if you were
Asked by rob, somebody that has
Been in this game, has
Experience, I nerve camped a day
In my life.
I stuck to rob and we agreed
That we would take each other to
The end.
 okay, that's fine.
So, I guess that's all I have.
Thank you for your answers.
 jeff: Thanks, andrea.
 sorry if I ever seemed
Creepy.
 jeff: Ashley, you're up.
 congratulations, you guys.
Phillip, I don't have any
Questions for you because,
Frankly, I'm sick of hearing
Your voice, so I'm going to
Speak and you're not going to
Comment.
 I will, if I feel the need.
 no, you're not.
 yes, I will, I'm doing it
Now.
 that's really patreatic.
You look really pathetic.
I am going to say my piece and
You just sit this.
 say your peace but don't tell
Me what I'm going to do.
 first of all, I want to start
By thanking you, because I came
Into this game really, really an
Impatient person.
Having survived a tortorrous 38
Days with you, I can get through
Anything.
So thank you.
 you sound like a little
Whiney child.
 moving on.
Natalie, we actually agreed to
Share everything, and we did, as
Far as I was concerned.
And when I asked you to make
Just a gesture as a friend to
Let me know if I was going home,
You actually told me I was
Coming back that night.
 it was a back-and-forth
Decision between rob and I
Whether to keep phillip or you.
Honestly, 10 minutes before
Tribal council, we decided that
It was going to be you you are a
Bigger threat than if yo were
Sitting here, you want the
People sitting here--
 that don't deserve to be
There.
I get it.
And that's kind of sad.
Rob, obviously, you deceived a
Lot of people, and I just feel
Kind of sad because I-- I, too,
Put you up on a pedestal.
I get that it's a game, but I
Don't know who you are, and,
Honestly, after this, I don't
Even know if I really want to
Know.
That's all I have to say.
 jeff: Thanks, ashley.
Grant.
 hi, guys.
Natalie, I also had an alliance
With rob that I thawfts pretty
Strong.
And I just want to know from
Your opinion, and I know it's
Already been harped on a little
Bit, but just, what was the
Dynamic of that alliance to you?
And, rob, the question goes to
You as well and vice versa.
Natalie, go ahead.
 rob came to me in the very
Beginning, and we both-- we both
Felt like we could trust each
Other.
And I know both of us had the
Same, maybe, conversation with
Rob.
I don't know what went on with
You two.
I just knew that you were a huge
Threat, and I think you know
That you-- that you were in some
Game.
 first of all, natalie came up
To me and said, "tell me what to
Do."
So I said, "natalie, if you do
Exactly what I tell you to do,
I'll take you all the way to the
End."
The relationship that we had, I
Also trusted and valued all the
Way up until I felt like you
Were going to kick my ass.
Because, honestly, I didn't want
To go against you sitting here.
 well, I still think it would
Have been fun to duke it out at
The end with you like I said
From the very beginning.
And-- good luck.
 jeff: Ralph, you're up.
 well, appreciate you all
Making it, ladies and gentlemen.
Natalie, it seemed like you
Can't really do nothing without
Keeping your eye on road, like a
Kid.
 I-- you know, I didn't
Realize that you all thought I
Was creepy towards rob.
I found a really-- rob and I had
A really good relationship out
Here.
So--
 so you're trying to keep an
Eye on him.
You're afraid to make a decision
Without him.
You never did talk to me in the
Game, period.
We never did talk, never did.
 there was a reason for that,
And that was because--
 he said not to.
 I wanted my tribe to trust
Me, and we all saw what happened
With matt, so I wanted my tribe
To realize that I was going to
Be loyal to them.
And I didn't want any
Misconception.
 another you done great.
Phillip, you've let me down.
I was wanting a whole chicken on
That head.
Tell me why you ain't got any
More feathers than that.
 well, I only put the feathers
In as I discovered them so these
Are the only feathers I
Discovered.
Sorry to disappoint you.
 do you really like me,
Phillip?
 actually, ralph, out of all
Of the people that were on your
Tribe, I love your work ethic.
I think you were funny.
You're a very decent man.
And I think that if you were in
Our tribe, you and I would have
Got along pretty well.
Thank you for playing the game.
 thank you, phillip.
 you're welcome, ralph.
 jeff: Matt, you're up.
 all right.
Hi, guys.
My one question here is for rob.
Clearly, you're a very
Duplicitous, manipulating,
Deceiving, and you were a liar.
Where is the line drawn after
117 days, 10 years, and four
Seasons of "survivor?"
Because I just don't know how
You can keep yourself together
After this much time out here.
 the line's drawn as soon as
I'm back in my real life.
But inside of the game of
"survivor," I feel like it's
Necessary to play like this.
I had alliances with every
Member of the ometepe.
And at one point or another,
Everybody thought that they were
Going to the end with me.
Until they were voted out.
Which is pretty harsh, but I
Find it to be very effective in
Playing.
 well, all the people that you
Betray read having a very hard
Time understanding who you
Really are.
Great job to all three of you.
 jeff: Thanks, matt.
Julie.
 you three should be sitting
There very, very humble, very
Humble because in my opinion,
None of you played a respectable
Game.
Natalie, when you won the first
Immunity challenge, I told you
How proud your parents were
Going to be of you, their little
Girl.
Now that the game is over, a
Question for you to ask
Yourself-- because I don't want
To hear the answers from any of
You guys-- is do you think your
Parents would be proud of the
Way that you played the game?
Because if you were my daughter,
The answer would be no.
I would be very sad to see my
Daughter be a servant to anybody
The way you were a servant to
Rob.
Phillip, you're right-- rob did
Bring you here to the end, and
It's not because of your
Loyalty.
It's because everybody here on
The tribe, none of us like or
Respect you at all.
That's why you're here.
My message to you is you are the
Father of a 16-year-old son--
 and very proud of it.
 and I hope that you ask
Yourself would your son be proud
Of the way that you played the
Game?
 my son would be very proud of
The way I played the game.
As you often said, "phillip,
You're the hardest working man
On your tribe."
It's only now that you're
Sitting on the jury that you see
Something else.
 I'm not going to take your
Work ethic away from you.
 the hell with you.
 okay.
Rob, look who you're sitting
Next to, the little girl who
Rode your coattails and the guy
Who nobody respects.
 I came out here to kick your
Ass.
 in the challenges?
 I didn't do it in the
Challenges.
I did it in the social game.
That's why none of you knew how
Close I was to boston rob.
 rob, my message to you is as
A father, teach your daughters
To grow up to be strong women
And not be treated the way that
You treated natalie.
Thank you.
 jeff: Mike, you're up.
 don't worry.
They'll be all smiles later.
 okay, phillip, rob, natalie,
Through my "survivor" experience
I was able to get closer to god,
Build my faith, develop some
Incredible friendships, meet
Some incredible people and some
Incredible bonds, and find some
Inner peace for myself,
Something that you can't
Purchase with money.
My-- my question to each one of
You is, aside from learning how
To deceive and trick and win a
Million dhars, did you learn
Anything about yourselves out
Here that you're going to carry
With you?
Natalie, go ahead and fire away.
 I learned a lot.
Being that I'm 19 years old,
Fresh out of high school, never
Have camped, really.
I didn't think that I would make
It 39 days sleeping on bamboo,
Eating two spoonfuls of rice.
But I'm strong and I'm more
Capable than I ever thought I
Could be.
This experience has provided me
With confidence with my life.
And I've really come to
Appreciate my family and what
They've made me to be today.
 very good, thank you.
Rob?
 I think the biggest thing
I've learned through this, being
My fourth time, is that I need
To stop playing games.
It's time to put it to rest.
This is the last day I will ever
Play.
At some t this point, I need to
Go home and take care of my wife
And my children.
That's what I'm going to do.
 okay, okay.
Phillip?
 for me, I feel so blessed
That I had the opportunity to do
This because I ain't never done
Anything like this in my life.
You know what I learned?
That I could stand on my own.
I could be by myself.
An outcast, which I already
Knew, but in this environment.
I could bring what I've done my
Whole entire life as a boy who
Left home at 16 years old and
Worked through the service,
Became a federal agent, and
Support my child by myself.
I am a beacon in the sheppard
Family.
 very good.
Okay.
Well, thanks, guys.
I appreciate that.
 jeff: Thanks.
Steve, you're up.
 I congratulate you guys for
Withs standing the elements here
For the last 39 days, and,
Natalie, I just really want to
Commend you for being 19 years
Old, however you had to play the
Game, you're sitting over there
And I'm over here.
So I congratulate you for that.
 thank you.
 rob, I take nigh hat off to
You, too.
117 days-- I buckled at 31.
So, I congratulate you a fellow
Warrior that took it to another
Level.
Phillip, I just-- I just gotta
Say that-- I'm sorry for you.
For who you are, what you've
Grown into.
I think you're pretty shameful,
Sorry man.
Good luck to you too, wherever
You have going on.
 jeff: David close it out.
 and now for something
Completely dinner.
I'm not going to ask you guys
Any questions.
I'm not even going to talk to
You.
I'm going to talk to them.
There's really only one logical
Decision here.
One person doesn't deserve it,
So we can cut him off.
The other one thanked somebody
For doing it all.
Who did she thank?
The guy sitting in the middle.
He did everything, and most
Importantly, he managed to
Blinded side us and in the prfs
Doing that he sent a message to
His tribe, if any of you show
Any signs of not buying loyal,
You're going to go home.
He controlled all of you.
He controlled your minds.
He controlled what you did.
He controlled your thoughts.
All bought it and one by one by
One, all of you were blindside.
A little ruthless, but
Brilliant.
When we started this game, two
People came in.
One of them clapped to be the
Best ever to play the game.
He walked out on day eight.
There's a guy sitting over there
That just played the best
Strategic game this game has
Ever seen, and it's pretty damn
Easy to tell who deserves to get
Your vote tonight.
 jeff: Thanks, david.
 you're welcome.
 jeff: All right, so, pretty
Healthy back-and-forth.
Great questions.
Jury, you've had a lot of
Information.
I'm going to give you a minute
To think about everything you've
Heard.
And then we will come back and
You will make a million-dollar
Decision.
 jeff: All right, jury,
You've had your chance to
Address natalie, rob, and
Phillip.
You've heard their responses.
It's now time to vote.
Tonight, you are voting for a
Winner.
For the person you think most
Deserving of the title of sole
Survivor and the million dollars
