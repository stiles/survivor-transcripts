        Previously on Survivor.
So far, Matt has been the only person
to find redemption at Redemption Island.
Matt stays alive.
He has won all three duels.
Grab you stuff and wait
for you next opponent.
At Matt's old tribe phillip
is driving everyone crazy.
*****
So Rob actually considered
keeping him around for a while.
As long as Phillip is
aggravating everybody so much,
It takes all of the heat off
of me. Maybe he needs to stay.
****








Since throwing a challenge
to get rid of Russell...
This is my last time playing this game.
The Zapatera looks like they lost their
mojo and bickering among themselves.
David under pressure
is really stressful.
Don't even go there with
that. I don't freak out.
And even though Sarita is
wearing thin on her tribe mates
the bigger targets were
Krista and Stephanie.
There is nothing we can do about it.
At tribal council, Kristen
and Stephanie voted for Steve
but everybody else voted Krista.
Krista, the tribe has spoken.
Now Stephanie has to
scramble to avoid being
the next person sent
to Redemption Island.
- Matt? Matt?
- Who is?








- Krista.
- ***
- Are you...
- Yeah, for sure.
****
I was excited, I saw him in the dual
and he has such a positive attitude,
just refreshing, I guess you could
say, even within the first five minutes
I feel he has so much
more substance than the
people I have been on the
tribe for the last 14 days.
- You pray a lot?
- Yeah, yeah.
I have been... Whenever I can. I
really feel like God put me here.
I just wanted you to know that I am
going to give you a run for your money.
Oh, trust me, I know you are.
Krista came in tonight, I was
pretty excited to see her at first,
but I quickly realized that he is a
firecracker and he is here for business.
You are not sneaking
under the radar, blondie.
- Neither are you, blondie.
- Hey!
It kind of sucks for me to see
your name come up last night.
It's too bad. I just have to
have a lot of faith in people.
Tribal last night got a little ugly
but in the end Krista was our vote,
and to my surprise, Krista and
Stephanie both voted for me.
That was kind of a cold slap of reality.
- Why did you vote for me?
- ***
- I'm just asking you, just you and I.
- It has nothing to do with you per se.
It is about the game, the team
that is the strongest competitor.
I know you are digging deep but
it might not be there to give.
I was trying to be delicate.
I am going to, you know, not be
too crazy about bashing people.
Except I don't want to get sent to
Redemption Island and right now I am at
the bottom, as much as I hate sucking
it up with people who are complete...
*****
I'm sorry you are personally
offended that I voted for you.
It is crazy. Where I come
from, 13 years in the NFL
and it is a gut check I am definitely
going to have to dig deeper,
but her vote against me last
night, I consider it stupid.
I think it was another
poor move you have made.
- It's okay.
- In alliances.
It's okay. I didn't ask for your opinion
and if that is your opinion that's fine.
Well, thank you for explaining.
She is basically tightening
the rope around her neck.
If we have to go back
to tribal she is out.

We should have another beach day.
I have an appointment with Natalie.
*****
- Ow!
- Sorry.
Natalie and I kind of
started a little SPA today,
we are like clipping our leg
hairs and like fixing our eyebrows.
Like what are we doing right
now? They're like, building stuff
and we're doing nothing.
Rob **** and Andrea
is pretending to help.
Phillip **** like every 20, 30 minutes.
However you can make yourself
seem more comfortable, why not?
I worked hard all of my life, I
was a basketball player, in pageant,
it is not like I am lazy,
Natalie and I have just hanging.
- ***
- ***
- What you guys doing? Hair?
- Oh, yeah.
**** Right down the side.
And a part right here.
Give me the scissorsly take
care of that real quick.
- You are not coming near me.
- ****
- Girls, I have a request.
- What's that?
And that is every half an
hour or so, check on the fire.
- You know, I do that.
- I know you do.
- I am not singling you out.
- Right.
I am just saying, you
know, I have been over there
like four or five times
this morning just doing it,
so what I want to try to do like every
25 minutes, half an hour you work it
out amongst yourself because we have
wet wood here or the
next couple of days.
- Okay.
- I have it stoking right now.
- Thank you, Phillip.
- Thanks Philly.
If I go to Redemption Island
before Ashley and Natalie,
there is something wrong with
the game, because those two girls,
they are on a beauty pageant.
That's their whole world,
but it is hard to compete and do
anything when you have two girls who
who won't get off their butts and
won't by you real credit for anything.
It reminds me of when somebody
who don't like dogs had a dog.
You have seen that.
I am their redheaded stepchild.
These two girls messed up.
They have been here 14 days and
frankly, the pageant is over.
- I have a headache.
- ***
Tree mail.
Look at her comfort.
- It is really exciting. Awesome.
- Great.
It was great getting my luxury
item, provided some comfort and just
some strength of words
of wisdom and nice strong
relationship with the Lord ***
you can't find anywhere else.
We give this day to you, Lord,
and we know whatever the outcome
is that it will bring honor to you Lord
and we thank you so much for letting
us be here together on
Redemption Island, Lord,
and help us to carry
on, honoring you ***
- Amen.
- Amen.
Krista is different from the
other competitors I have paced,
for one key reason, it is both
of us have really been struggling
with not having a faith community
and other believers to kind of lean
on and talk with about our
beliefs and how we feel.
It certainly makes it a lot more
difficult to compete with her.
****
I definitely have a
little anxiety about the
possibility that this
could be my last day.
Come on in.
Andrea and Natalie, take a seat.
Julie and Mike, pick
a spot and get to this.
Now bringing the
competitors for today's dual.
Matt will be battling against Krista,
voted out at the last tribal council.
You guys ready to get to it?
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
For today's dual you will use a
grappling hook to get three bags.
Each bag contains a ball,
once you have all three bags you will
use one ball to solve the table maze.
First person to get it right
stays alive in this game.
Loser is out. Their quest
for a million dollars kaput.
This is it. One shot. Pick your spot.
All right. Here we go.
It is do or die time.
Survivors ready. Go.
You have to retrieve three
bags using the grappling hook
and stay on the platform while
doing it. Matt with the first toss.
Can he hook the first bag? Just misses.
Krista really taking her time.
Great first toss and with one toss
Krista has secured her first bag.
Matt with a nice toss.
Matt has his first bag.
Gently pulling it back.
Doesn't want to lose it.
Krista readies her second toss.
Another great toss by krista.
Two tosses, two bags.
Matt now panicking.
Matt with a nice toss. Can he
secure a bag? It looks good.
Matt with his second bag.
Krista has made three
throws and with three tosses
she has grabbed all three
bags. Krista now unwrapping.
Get one ball and start
working on the table maze.
Matt has one bag left.
Big advantage for Krista.
This could do it if he can hook it.
Got it. Got to get it back.
Krista has her ball and she
is going to start working.
Matt has his third bag and still looking
for one ball. That's all you need.
- Matt, you need to get that bag on.
- ****
Matt has his ball and working on the
table maze. It is not a simple maze.
There are a lot of
places that ball can fall
into a hole and you
will have to start over.
Matt is going to have to pick it up now.
Drops in a hole and has to start over.
Krista coming up on a
tough spot. She gets by it.
Both, Matt and Krista still alive.
Krista took an early lead and
has held it throughout this dual
but Matt is catching up fast.
Matt is by one of the tougher spots only
to find another one
and he gets by that one.
Krista with another very difficult
spot to get by. She is still in it.
We are neck and neck in this dual.
Matt with a nice job. Matt now
has the lead in this challenge.
Krista continues to fight.
Matt has a tough spot to
navigate, close to the finish.
Krista falls in the hole.
She has to start over again.
Matt very close. Got to
get it in that netting.
Matt stays alive!
How are you doing, Krista?
It is a real reality right
now that the game is over.
So it is emotional.
Well, Krista, you lasted
a long time in this game.
You are out of the game for good.
You can drop your buff on the way out.
- Can I give him something real quick?
- Yeah.
- It's a tough cookie, but...
- Thank you so much.
- What is that, Krista.
- My luxury item.
My Bible.
I don't have mine so she is
kind enough to leave it with me.
Is that something the
two of you guys shared?
Yeah.
You know, Matt is extremely strong
believer and I think, you know,
that might be one of the reasons
he is doing so well out there.
- All right, Krista.
- Bye.
Matt and I agreed at the end
of the dual today it would be
God's will that was done and
it was. It was my time to go.
Krista left her bible to me and I
can't explain how much that meant to me,
because that book just breathes
life. I can never thank her enough.
Matt, once again, you seized the
moment. Four duels, four wins.
You can head back to Redemption
and a beat your next opponent.
- Thanks.
- Good work.
Krista gave him her luxury
item, a Bible on her way out,
and they were so close, and
then it is like Matt changed.
I had a good vibe with him but obviously
he bonded with Krista just as well.
So even though initially I want
Matt to stay in as long as possible,
he can be a very dangerous as well.
- ****
- Yeah.
It's like my tooth *****
and I got bacteria in it.
**** it will go away. It hurts so bad.
Poor Sarita, she thought had a cavity
and said some a bacteria got into it
I don't know how she knows that. She
is kind of a drama queen princess.
- Is it swollen a little?
- ****
Sarita, she is a two-faced
girl for this kind of game.
If she cleaned her teeth, ****
it is a good way to really get
out of the game on your own.
Out here, everything is nasty, and
sticking stuff like that in her mouth.
I mean who in God's name would
worry about your back teeth?
- You know what...? ****
- Sarita is going.
- I mean, oh, my God.
- Yes, really is.
You have to figure out how
to unseat her in the group.
Because quite frankly, if it is me in
a fight with them, I will shoot myself.
Stephanie is capable of, is a
capable competitor in the channel and
right now I think Sarita in this
time, is the weak player in the tribe.
If there is a way to get
Stephanie to be more a part of the
group and ultimately keep her I
would do that to sacrifice Sarita.
So I think you, in the sense that
you may not have a lot of time,
you should try and talk to
everyone individually today.
- I mean you cannot...
- ****
*****
I'm gonna sit here and think...
how to suck up to people I hate.
Why didn't I learn this in school?
Storm clouds are gathering. We
have to do some stockpilling.
Start gathering wood.
I see the clouds coming in,
probably going to get an early
rain like we did last night.
I consider this the
calm before the storm.
You know, I have been frustrated
with Natalie and Ashley,
they lay around when they see
that there is work to be done,
that I might be able
to use some assistance.
- ***
- *** Start gathering wood.
That is not asking, that is dictating.
***
And the girls are getting
the fruits of my labor but
they are not giving me one
iota of credit for it, zero.
And I am not going to stay there and
say, girls, can't you see how hard
I am working, give me some love too.
I am not going to play that game.
What go the girls do? What do
you want them to do? Nothing.
But they are 19, 20-Year-Old girls,
they are not going to do anything.
- ***
- They are not going to do anything.
And I am not going on the
one who try to tell them ***
I am not going to sugarcoat it anymore.
It is like I asked you guys four
times to help out with the wood,
you have been like
statues standing here.
Why do you talk to the girls a
certain way but nothing to the guys.
I do. In fact I said
would you help gather wood
and they immediately
started doing it. ***
- Am I wrong?
- You know?
Did you ask them a different
way, you come up to us and say:
- "A storm is coming, gather wood"
- I am tired of it.
I tell you what, tomorrow
I am fire free day.
I won't have to say anything to the boys
because they pull their weight here.
- We pull our weight and so does Andrea.
- ***
- ****
- "Andrea"
She makes it right and goes get
water and doesn't have to be told.
You two lay here like beauty queens ***
I am tired of being the red
stepchild to you too two, ok?
Get off your butt and
help out around here.
- Are you still talk something.
- Yes, I am.
You are going to see a new
attitude of me around here.
A new attitude, Phillip, we
have seen it before. Cool.
Get use to it, beauty queens.
Thank you. That's a compliment.
You see the fire is
going, whatever and you
won't do it until
somebody says something.
We are going to walk away.
Walk away and I will follow
you if you want me to.
If you want me to follow
you, I will follow you.
He is like mental, he
literally has a mental...
Somebody needs to diagnose him.
You lay around the entire
day in your r and r mode.
It is just annoying. I
am done with him, done.
If you don't like it, get tough.
You're not my dad, Phillip. Walk away.
I think this is going to
end up splitting the tribe.
The best thing for us to do is keep
winning and not get rid of anyone,
so immediately I said I
need to take Phillip aside
and I need to squash
this thing right away.
I understand that you don't
want to take it anymore
and I fully like I have been
in that position and I get it,
I just think at this point the most
important thing has to be team unity.
**** it is like a peace process to
bring the tribe back together again.
Phillip was right, the
girls weren't doing anything
but the less they do the happier I am.
I don't want them to
work hard and, you know,
giving us a reason to
write their name down and
win a million dollars
at the end of this thing.
I want to bore the heck out of
everyone as much as possible.
Who's in charge of fire?
That's the way I like it.
Guys. He is not going to be very happy.
Can I talk to you?
The first thing on my to do list of
trying to get back into this tribe
is to talk to Steve, but
I hate apologizing for
stuff like that, so it
is like, okay. Suck it up.
What's happening?
Hey, I am not really good at this, but I
want to say Im sorry for voting for you.
I know I kind of hurt your feelings
but that's not what I meant.
Stephanie took a moment and really
tried to either play the game a little
better or try to win me over
or really coming from
her heart, I am not sure.
I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you. That means a lot to me.
- Bringing us together, you know.
- I know.
And it is good to have
a positive attitude.
I know she is working hard, so I'm going
to keep that door open with Stephanie.
I always try to believe in
people until they absolutely,
you know, until I get stomped on.
You want me to tell
you the honest truth?
- Yeah.
- The name I do want to write down.
I wanted to write down Sarita's name.
I just see her as the
weakest person in the tribe,
but it is like ****
I have to keep that to myself.
**** I am thinking it too ****
In the challenges, stronger around
camp, just all the way around.
Steve agrees with me that
Sarita is a weaker competitor,
so I would love to go into a challenge
where I could show off everything I have
and then Sarita is lacking and pick
up her slack and win the challenge
and everyone is really happy
with me and I would feel great.
Any single thing would
help me at this point.
I mean, need to drag
her down and bring me up.
Come on in guys.
Mike, where is the animosity level
right now between Ometepe and Zapatera?
I think there is a little
clash going on right now, Jeff.
You know, we are in the
middle of this competition
and both tribes desperately want to win,
so I think it is going to
be a good challenge today.
Phillip, are you feeling that?
That there really is a rivalry?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Which animal are you using today?
- Both.
- Both?
- Both.
- Both.
Steve, a little concern he
has the gorilla and the lion?
- Oh, forearm.
- You catch that, Phillip?
- I caught it.
- All right.
I am ready to get to
this challenge. Shall we?
All right. First things first, I
will take back the immunity idol.
For today's challenge, two members
of each tribe will be responsible
for launching balls out
on to the beach where
the remaining tribe members
will catch the balls.
It doesn't matter what color a ball is.
If you catch a ball, you
score a point for your tribe.
First tribe to five wins immunity. ***
Losers go to tribal council where one
person will be voted out of this game
and sent to Redemption Island, in
addition you are playing for reward,
the winner tribe will be taken to a
beautiful spot high on the mountain
ove overlooking the viw where you
will enjoy a nice picnic lunch.
- Sound good?
- Yeah!
Zapatera, you have one extra
member, who are you going to sit out?
Sarita, didn't even think about it.
Sarita, take a spot on the bench.
Everybody else I will give
you a minute to strategize ****
All right. Here we go. Launching the
balls for Zapatera, Stephanie and David.
For Ometepe, it is Natalie and Phillip.
Out on the beach, the matchups,
we have Grant and Mike.
NFL player taking on
the marine. Big matchup.
Boston Rob going against Steve.
Deep in the back we have Julie
and Andrea and Ashley and Ralph.
Here we go. Survivors ready.
Three, two, one, release!
Natalie goes sport and Greg
connects scoring one for Ometepe.
- Stephanie goes deep.
- Julie... Julie!
Julie in and out. No score for Zapatera.
Ometepe leads one-zip.
Here we go. Three, two, one. Release.
In the air with a line drive.
Oh, Andrea makes a dive for it.
Natalie goes short. Chris connects!
Chris scores another point for Ometepe.
- Nice job!
- Good job!
Natalie and Grant connection is working.
Good job.
Get it in the net, guys!
Here we go, three, two, one! Release.
- David is deep to Ralph. No point.
- You fu...
Mike, trying to hold
Grant, he can't do it,
Natalie goes short to
Grant, Grant connects again!
You have got to catch
something. Come on.
Good strategy between Natalie and Grant.
- All right.
- ***
Come on, guys, let's go.
Ometepe now leads
three-zip. Playing to 5.
- Come on, guys.
- Here we go.
Three, two, one. Release.
Mike ripping Grant's shirt off.
Natalie goes short for Grant.
In and out.
Stephanie goes deep, Rob! Right
there with another point for Ometepe.
Steals one from Zapatera.
Ometepe leads 4-Zip.
Grant rips off what is left of
his shirt, presents it to Mike
who basically has been
tearing it off every point.
This could be the
final point for Ometepe.
Ometepe leads 4-Zip.
We are playing to five.
Here we go. Three, two, one. Release.
Natalie goes short. No, in and out.
- Steve...
- Rob just misses.
The winning point for Ometepe!
Mike and Grant have
been going at it hard.
Mike unable to score but doing
his best to slow Grant down.
That has not been
particularly successful.
- Keep your eyes open.
- All right, guys.
Keep it up, let's put
it to bed right here.
Ometepe leads 4-Zip and
we are playing to five.
- Immunity and a big reward.
- ***
This could be it. Here we go.
Three, two, one. Release.
Stephanie goes deep.
Boston Rob, in and out!
Natalie goes short.
Grant with the fifth and final point!
Ometepe wins immunity! And reward!
Ometepe, congratulations again.
No tribal council tonight for Ometepe.
Big reward, go somewhere
different, enjoy some food.
Head out and enjoy your afternoon.
All right, Zapatera, grab your
stuff and head back to camp.
I will see you tonight at tribal
where someone will somebody
be voted out of the game and
sent to Redemption Island.
Our decision tonight is vital
going into the next challenge.
We have lost two in a row and I
have got to have a winning team
with the right attitude
and a lot of fight in them.
A lot of lip service by Stephanie and
not a lot of uptown girl like Sarita.
It is going to be a tough decision.
- Oh, gosh. Are you kidding me?
- Man!
- Is this a lobster tail?
- Cookies!
- This is so much food.
- Oh, my gosh.
This is the best reward.
We have got food that we
could have eaten for days.
It was like fish,
guacamole like everything
we wanted to eat was on the table.
Yeah!
- Isn't this a great freaking view?
- Oh my gosh! This is ridiculous.
What do you think the statue
is? That is Jesus for sure.
Jesus! ****
- Everything we talk about, you guys.
- Oh, yes.
- ***
- Yep.
- ****
- ****
We show up at the reward, and we all
know that there is going to be a clue
to the hidden immunity idol,
because there is always a clue
so right away I spot the clue under
the lobster tail under the table,
at this point there is not
any reason for me to do it,
so I realize if I can't get it without
anybody else seeing that I got it,
I am going to let one of them get it.
So Grant sticks his hahn
and he grabs the note.
Check out the view.
This is amazing.
Let's look at it to
make sure it is not here.
- ****
- What do we got there boys?
I saw it.
So as Grant is showing
me the note, Phillip ends
up walking up the stairs
and sees the note too.
There was a little bit like, Grant and
I and we got busted by the principal.
- What does it say?
- Back at camp.
Back at camp.
I am in an alliance with Rob,
Grant and myself, in fact,
I caught the stealth,
I am the specialist,
Rob is the mental list,
and Grant is the assassin.
Remember, boys, stealth.
And yet today, when Rob and Grant pound
the clue for an idol
they tried to hide it.
Well, hell hath no fury
like a lion or a gorilla
when he thinks he has been provoked.
If you are going to make
an alliance with me you
better adhere to it because
I am all about integrity.
I served my country for
**** duty, honor, country,
that means something to me, and
when you try to trash on that,
me and the United States got something
for you when you try that one, baby.
I could dwell on a place of negativity
right now based on what I just saw,
I am not going to do that.
I am going to smile
and when the time comes,
I am going to kick a
little ass around here.
As a result of the loss today we
are headed to tribal council tonight
and it is going to be interesting.
I have lobbied for Stephanie
to stay and Sarita to go.
Sarita is more like a team
mom than a member of the team.
That's not who we need. We need somebody
who can actually contribute on the field
Sorry about that one, you all.
We just weren't miss to win
that one. That wasn't happening.
- We just got smoked.
- We just got smoked.
Yeah. It was just an ass whoopin'.
- ***
- Putting the best sig to win...
is more important than
anything else right now.
Think about that.
What I think is happening right
now is that David and Stephanie are
doing their damnedest to try to swap
her name on the docket with my name.
I would like to see Stephanie leave, but
I am not really going to go campaigning
because I am the most loyal
person that my tribe will ever see
and they all know that.
Six to six now, meaning we
can't sit out any player.
And the truth is, I know who the weakest
player is physically and that is Sarita.
The guys like Sarita. It is a
trust thing. They really trust her.
But if we don't have
numbers going in the merge...
- I know.
- We are going to be wiped out.
It is not a done deal yet.
We haven't talked yet...
I don't know what else to do.
The best I can do is show how
committed I am in these challenges
and you know what is important.
It is important to keep our numbers.
They know that I want it just
as bad as they do, because I do.
She's coming... Like, I
can't be anybody else...
- except for who I am.
- Well yeah.
That is just your
personality. Strong woman
in a little package,
that's what you are.
Thank you. That means a lot to me.
If they don't keep me, they are
going to lose every single challenge,
because they are not going to
be able to carry Sarita anymore.
**** are noticing that.
I know Dave is on my side.
****
I am sick of losing.
What do we have to focus on
now there is only one thing.
Winning.
- Trust comes later.
- *** Sorry, guys.
We know what our occupation options are.
Who are you voting for tonight?
Stephanie is definitely stronger
in the challenges, Sarita,
I have more trust in
so it goes either way.
I think they are both *** I
give them both a one out of ten.
I just disagree. I mean, I'm sorry.
I just fundamentally disagree
like... All I care about is winning.
Like seriously all I
care about is winning.
As we go to tribal council, one thing we
have got to weigh is
if Stephanie goes home,
Sarita is going to be
in the next challenge.
Sarita just has kind of been cruising.
Stephanie has more fight in her.
If stephanie can prove
that we can trust her,
I am not totally opposed
to keeping her around.
It is absolutely not
set in stone tonight.
David, take me back to the
first challenge that you threw.
Voluntarily lost to get rid of Russell.
How big of a regret is
starting to settle in now?
Obviously, we are paying the
price now for having given them
a breath of fresh air in terms
of moving forward in the game.
Had we kept our foot
on the throttle things
may be totally different
in terms of momentum.
Ralph, let's talk
about today's challenge,
because you guys just got
destroyed in this challenge.
I think we started the
gauge out wrong today.
We had no balls coming our way.
If I had been shooting I believe
I could have done a little better.
Sarita, why set you out?
I would liked to have been
out in the field catching.
I thought she was shaking
in her boots when she
found out we were going
to do a contact sport,
but I am fine with
her sitting out because
I don't think she is that
great during challenges.
When you say you thought
she was quaking in
her boots about doing
something physical...
She was worried she was
going to have to get in
there and it is like I
don't care, let's do this.
Let's go, you know?
But I didn't want to be
the one that said okay I can
definitely do it and end up not
being able to follow through.
So then you are saying you were glad to
sit out because then
you couldn't be a goat?
- Well, no.
- That's exactly what she said.
I am hearing the same
thing you are hearing.
That she was. Going to put
a fight about participating
in the challenge because
she knew she was the worst,
as in result of that she is
not going to be in trouble now
because she didn't have any part
in the challenge and the failure.
But I am not saying I am not good. I
would have been fine to be out there.
*****
I am a big active member of this tribe
and it is horrible to watch that loss.
I mean, I was really upset
about the challenge as well,
you know, it is sad to
lose someone, bottom line.
- Do you buy that, Stephanie?
- Absolutely not.
I haven't heard anyone
complain as much as she does.
So for me, my impression is,
she doesn't want to be here.
That's not true. You have no idea...
I am near you when you live if...
That's your opinion you are fine if
you think that but you are way off base.
- I don't think so.
- Well, that's fine but you are.
Okay.
Steve, is there any part
of you that wonders, maybe
Stephanie's spunk alone is
worth keeping her around?
On the proceed for Stephanie,
he is a warrior at heart.
She works hard around the campsite.
Sarita in opposity side is
a trustworthy confidant I
would like to see her do
more about the campsite
and see her pick up
the challenge as well.
You know, she is a bit of an
uptown girl that I don't think
has gotten her footing out
here in the wilderness yet.
Sounds like two of the
positives are actually negatives
there but that could have
been just my perception.
To tell you the truth, Jeff, if the
tribe is too obsessed with trusting
one another at a time when trust
is not the most important issue.
The stage we are at right now
focuses on putting the best six out
in the field to do what
we need to do to win,
trust will come with time, right
now we need to focus on winning.
Ralph what do you think
of that strategic layout?
Sounds pretty good. Sounds real good.
Well, tonight's vote
is clearly a big vote.
Which direction is this tribe
going to go? Let's find out.
It is time to vote. Ralph, you are up.
Meybe if you pass more time
thinking about your actions and
how you fit in with your tribe,
you would still be around.
**** I will see you zero on Redemption
Island, I will kick your ass then.
I made the best arguments for you,
Stephanie, hopefully this works.
I will go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final,
person voted out will be asked to leave
the tribal council area immediately.
I will read the votes.
First vote, Sarita.
Stephanie, one vote, one vote Sarita.
Sarita, two votes Sarita.
Stephanie, that's two votes
Stephanie, two votes for Sarita.
Stephanie, three votes
Stephanie, two votes Sarita.
Sixth person voted out of survivor
Redemption Island, Stephanie.
That's four, that is enough,
you need to bring me your torch.
Stephanie, the tribe has spoken.
But you will have a chance
to get back in this game.
Grab your for and head
to Redemption Island.
Well, you made the decision to go
with somebody you think you can trust
versus keeping somebody that might
have done better at challenges.
We will know soon enough
if you made the right call.
Grab your torches and head
back to camp. Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
Next time on Survivor.
One of the most
difficult aspects expects
of the game of Survivor
is mental fatigue.
I am losing my mind.
- Dave is bugging me.
- His a loose cannon.
- Crazy, crazy, crazy.
- Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
- No!
- If we lose, the target is on me.
My strategy out here is to be
brutally honest about Zapatera tribe.
No way. You don't want
to align with my people.
- I don't think I do.
- They are not nice people,
when it comes down to it. When I win ***
