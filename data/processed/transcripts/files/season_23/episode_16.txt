 --- 

        I JUST GRADUATED COLLEGE FOUR
DAYS AGO.
I CAME OUT HERE THINKING I
REALLY COULD DO ANYTHING.
Jeff: THIS IS SOPHIE'S
CHALLENGE TO WIN RIGHT NOW.
I WAS A VERY STRONG PERSON
BUT I THINK OUT HERE I FOUND OUT
A LOT MORE ABOUT MY WEAKNESSES.
IT DOES HURT.
IT'S ABOUT OUTWITTING,








OUTLASTING, AND OUTPLAYING.
WHEN IT COMES TO OUTPLAYING, I
WON THREE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITYES.
Jeff: SOPHIE, WITH THAT,
WINS FINAL IMMUNITY.
WHEN IT CAME TO OUTWITTING--
WHERE IS YOUR STRATEGIC MIND
NOW?
I MEAN, I'M THE BRAINS BEHIND
THE OPERATION.
ARE YOU THE DRAGON SLAYER.
THE NEW SLAYER IS BORN!
Jeff: WELCOME TO THE
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC" LIVE








REUNION SHOW IN LOS ANGELES
WHERE SOPHIE HAS JUST WON A
MILLION DOLLARS
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS A-- THOSE LAST FEW DAYS
WERE VERY TOUGH FOR YOU
EMOTIONALLY.
WE JUST SAW IT PLAY OUT.
HOW IS IT RIGHT NOW EMOTIONALLY?
DID YOU SENSE YOU MIGHT HAVE
WON?
I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD
CHANCE.
I MEAN, COACH GOT DEMOLISHED IN
THE FINAL TRIBAL, I MEAN,
WHITNEY GAVE ME HER PIECE OF
MIND, TOO.
SORRY.
I HAD A FEELING, BUT YOU
NEVER KNOW.
Jeff: IT WAS A VERY QUIET
GAME YOU PLAYED.
WHAT WAS THE KEY?
YEAH, I THINK THAT RIGHT AWAY
I STARTED SUSSING PEOPLE OUT.
YOU SAW ME DO IT WITH BRANDON.
I THINK I HAD MY FINGER ON THE
PULSE OF THE GAME THE WHOLE TIME
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT
PEOPLE'S MOTIVATIONS AND TRIED
TO WORK WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE GAME.
THEY CREATED THIS RELIGIOUS
FRAMEWORK, THIS IDEA OF BEING
LOYAL, BEING TRUSTWORTHY, AND I
JUST KIND OF WORKED WITHIN THAT.
AND GOT TO THE END.
Jeff: DO YOU SEE THAT
APPROACH TO THIS GAME RELATING
TO YOUR OWN LIFE ABOUT JUST
OBSERVING AND TRYING TO FIND
WHERE YOU FIT IN A SITUATION?
YEAH.
I THINK-- I THINK I ALWAYS-- I'M
ALWAYS KIND OF THE LAST TO SPEAK
UP OFTEN AT MEETINGS AND, YOU
KNOW, GROUP PROJECTS AND STUFF.
I KNOW-- I FIND MYSELF TO BE
MORE OF AN OBSERVER THAN
ANYTHING ELSE.
SO, YEAH.
I'M SORRY, I'M REALLY EXCITED
AND FLUSTERED RIGHT NOW
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jeff: WHAT'S THE REACTION
BACK HOME?
BECAUSE YOU COME FROM A FAIRLY
SMALL TOWN, RIGHT?
I COME FROM A TOWN OF 1500.
EVERYBODY IN WILLSBORO, IS GOING
CRAZY.
I'M FACEBOOK FRIENDS WITH PRETTY
MUCH EVERYBODY IN MY TOWN NOW.
YEAH, THEY'RE SUPER SUPPORTIVE.
I THINK I PROBABLY HAVE MORE
FANS IN MY TOWN THAN THE WHOLE
COUNTRY SO IT'S AWESOME.
Jeff: DID YOU TELL YOUR
FAMILY-- WEEK BY WEEK, DID YOU
TELL THEM HOW YOU WERE DOING?
NOBODY KNEW.
BEFORE I CAME I TOLD MY SISTER I
DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HOPES UP
BUT I LOST.
NOBODY IN MY FAMILY KNEW.
Jeff: WHEN YOU'RE BACK HOME
AND PEOPLE ASK, "WHAT IS IT
LIKE?"
HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THIS
EXPERIENCE IS LIKE TO GO
THROUGH.
IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S-- IT'S
LIFE CHANGING, AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL SOMEBODY, OH, THIS
REALITY TV SHOW CHANGED MY LIFE
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO STUPID BUT
IT'S NOT.
THIS CHANGED MY LIFE.
I LIKE TO SAY THIS IS-- THIS
CRAZY ADVENTURE ON AN ISLAND
THAT SUDDENLY IS BEING SHOWN ON
TV TO THE WORLD AND, YOU KNOW,
THIS LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE
THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE ARE
EXPERIENCING WITH ME.
AND THEN I SAY THAT I WAS REALLY
HUNGRY.
SO...
( LAUGHTER ).
Jeff: A COUPLE OF TIMES IT
CAME UP THAT-- THAT PEOPLE WHO
DON'T KNOW YOU, STRANGERS, SAW
YOU AS A SELFISH, SPOILED,
ENTITLED BRAT, OR WORDS TO THAT
EFFECT.
HARD TO HEAR.
BUT, SOPHIE, WHEN YOU GO HOME,
YOU'RE A THINKER.
DID ANY PART OF THAT RING TRUE
AT ALL, OR DO YOU STILL THINK
THEY JUST DONT KNOW ME?
YEAH, I THINK THAT I HAVE
VERY HARD EXTERIOR, AND I THINK
THAT COMES OFF SOMETIMES AS, YOU
KNOW, TOO BLUNT, STANDOFFISH,
AND MAYBE PRETENTIOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
I THINK I'M VERY CONFIDENT IN
MYSELF.
I WAS A GIRL SCOUT, I WAS TAUGHT
TO BE CONFIDENT.
I WAS TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE TO HAVE
SELF-ESTEEM AND HAVE THAT THROWN
BACK IN MY FACE AS A WEAKNESS IS
HARD.
I THINK I LEARNED FROM THAT AS
WELL.
I'M TRYING TO BE A LITTLE MORE
LIKE DAWN IN MY LIFE.
Jeff: THAT'S NOT A BAD WAY
TO BE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WELL, SOPHIE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO
IT ALONE.
SHE DID RELY ON A TIGHT ALLIANCE
WITH COACH.
HE WAS PLAYING FOR A THIRD TIME
AND COACH WAS SEEKING
REDEMPTION.
I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME TWICE.
THIS TIME I'M HERE TO WIN.
THEY'RE TEMPORARY PLAYERS.
I GUARANTEE YOU THIS, IF YOU
HAVE A STRONG FIVE, THAT'S AN
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NUT TO CRACK.
I FEEL LIKE A MOB BOSS.
IF ANYBODY GOES AGAINST THE
FAMILY, THEY'RE DEAD.
FATHER WE ASK THAT YOU BLESS US
AND GIVE US FAVOR IN THE
CHALLENGE.
Jeff: UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY!
BEEP-BEEP.
WE'RE BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,
BABY.
AND I LOOK BACK AT THE PAST 39
DAYS, AND I DON'T THINK I COULD
HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME MUCH
BETTER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jeff: COACH, YOU-- YOU WERE
DIFFERENT.
I HEARD IT FROM PEOPLE ON THE
STREET THE ENTIRE SEASON.
"I REALLY LIKE COACH THIS TIME."
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU WERE
DIFFERENT?
ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, TO GET TO THE
END AS A RETURNING PLAYER AFTER
WHAT BOSTON ROB DID LAST YEAR,
WE ALL GAVE UP A LOT, YOU KNOW.
WE ALL GAVE UP A LOT TO GO OUT
THERE.
BUT I WAS JOYOUS THIS TIME.
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.
MY FAVORITE MOMENTS ARE SOME OF
OUR INTERACTIONS WHERE YOU CAN
SEE I'M JUST LOVING EVERY
SECOND.
IT'S LIKE A GIFT.
THE FIRST TIME YOU PLAY YOU WANT
TO GET TO THE END.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE EVERY
SECOND IS LIKE ANOTHER GIFT OUT
THERE.
AND I JUST FEEL FOR ME IT WAS AN
AMAZING RUN.
I FEEL VERY HUMBLED BY THIS
GAME.
Jeff: DID YOU GET THE
REDEMPTION YOU SOUGHT?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THIS.
THE FIRST SHOW I LOOKED AT
MYSELF AND I WAS LIKE, MAN, THAT
GUY IS SO ARROGANT.
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THAT
PERSON.
THE GAME HAS REALLY CHANGED MY
LIFE WITHOUT QUESTION.
YOU SEE THAT FIRST PERSON.
YOU SEE THIS PERSON NOW.
I DON'T TAKE MYSELF SERIOUSLY.
I HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH
EVERYTHING AND I THINK I'M A LOT
MORE GROUNDED AND DOWN TO EARTH.
Jeff: EXPLAIN TO ME ABOUT
THE PRAYER THING.
BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE PRAYING
THIS SEASON THAN EVER.
AND I'M NOT-- I'M NOT
DISCOUNTING IT.
BUT HERE'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND-- I KNOW FROM THE
STREETS A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME
THIS.
IT'S ONE THING TO PRAY BECAUSE
THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY TOUGH.
IT'S ANOTHER TO PRAY FOR THAT
GUY TO FIND A CLUE ON DAY 22 OF
"SURVIVOR."
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jeff: WHERE WAS THAT LINE
FOR YOU?
I THINK TO SOME PEOPLE OUR
PRAYER MIGHT SEEM TRITE,
HYPOCRITICAL, MAYBE SHALLOW.
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE SOMETHING--
THAT IS A SHAKABLE WORLD OUT
THERE AND YOU WANT TO GRASP ON
TO SOMETHING IF YOU HAVE FAITH
THAT IS UNSHAKABLE.
NOW IN THE PAST I PRAYED EVERY
DAY.
THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT WITH
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE, LIKE
BRANDON AND ALBERT, IT BECAME
ALMOST LIKE A PRAYER-A-PALOZZA,
WHERE EVERYBODY WAS PRAYING
OPENLY EVERY DAY.
IT REALLY BECAME INGRAINED INTO
OUR FABRIC OF SOCIETY BUT TO
GRAB ON TO SOMETHING LIKE FAITH
THAT IS UNSHAKABLE IT'S VERY
REAL TO ME AND IT'S REAL TO
PEOPLE LIKE BRANDON AND ALBERT
WHO PRAY EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Jeff: ALBERT, YOU WARNED
COACH, DON'T BRING SOPHIE.
WHAT DID YOU KNOW?
I OBSERVED THE WAY SHE PLAYED
THE GAME.
IF YOU'RE PLAYING "SURVIVOR" AND
NOT OBSERVING EVERYONE IN THE
GAME, YOU'RE NOT PLAYING
PROPERLY.
I KNEW SOHPIE HAD A FEW
ATTRIBUTES
THAT COULD WIN HER THE MILLION.
Jeff: THE JURY, JUST SO
EVERYONE KNOWS, RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU WERE ON THE JURY.
ANOTHER NOW.
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN, IF
COACH INSTEAD WENT TO THE END
WITH, SAY, ALBERT AND RICK, IF
SOPHIE ISN'T THERE, DOES COACH
WIN?
SHOW OF HANDS.
THE ANSWER WAS YES, COACH.
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK MAYBE I'M
TAKING THE WRONG PEOPLE?
I COULD WIN THIS GAME?
YOU'RE REALLY DAMNED IF YOU
DO OR DAMNED IF YOU DON'T.
IF I END UP CUTTING THESE PEOPLE
AND TAKING, LIKE, COCHRAN AND
EDNA TO THE END, PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO SAY COACH WASN'T A MAN
OF HIS WORD.
HE COMPROMISED WHO HE WAS.
I KNEW GOING ON, AND I SAID FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING, LIKE THE
SEVEN LAYERS OF VIKING HEAVEN --
I LIKE THE VIKING REFERENCE.
I LOVE IT!
YOU WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE TO
THE END THAT YOU MADE PROMISES
TO AND THAT ARE HONORABLE
WINNERS.
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN
OZZY UP THERE--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jeff: THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN A WISE CHOICE.
TO BRING OZZY.
OBVIOUSLY, THIS WASN'T SUCH A
WISE CHOICE.
Jeff: IN FACT, OZZY YOU
MADE A COMMENT ON THE SHOW,
MILLION-DOLLAR CHALLENGE.
ONE MORE TIME WITH THE JURY,
THIS MAY BE A QUESTION I DON'T
HAVE TO ASK.
IF OZZY IS IN THE END, DOES HE
WIN?
YES.
YES.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: THAT CLOSE.
BUT WHO DID WIN WAS THIS WOMAN
RIGHT HERE BY OUTLAST BE
EVERYBODY ELSE, SOPHIE.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN WE COME BACK,
OZZY CAME SO CLOSE BUT FELL JUST
SHORT.
PLUS COCHRAN AND STILL TO COME,
SPRINT IS GOING TO GIVE AWAY
$100,000 TO YOUR FAVORITE
SURVIVOR, AND BRANDON AND HIS
UNCLE RUSSELL WILL TALK ABOUT
THIS SEASON.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THAT.
BE RIGHT BACK.
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT A WILD RIDE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'VE ALMOST BEEN THERE A FEW
TIMES AND I JUST HAVEN'T LOCKED
MY HANDS ON THE MILLION DOLLARS.
EVERYBODY IS SOILED, YES?
YES.
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST PEOPLE
AND THOSE PEOPLE CAN STICK A
KNIFE RIGHT IN YOUR GUT.
Jeff: YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO
GET BACK IN YOUR GAME.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
I TRIED TO GET THERE AND IT
DIDN'T HAPPEN.
Jeff: SOPHIE WINS FINAL
IMMUNITY.
YEAH YEAH, THAT WAS A
MILLION-DOLLAR PUZZLE.
BUT I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF
THE WAY I PLAYED.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC" LIVE
REUNION SHOW IN LOS ANGELES.
OZZY, A THIRD TIME.
IT'S OVER 100 DAYS, I THINK,
YOU'VE PLAYED THIS GAME.
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS
ADVENTURE THAT BROUGHT YOU BACK
AGAIN?
I MEAN, HONESTLY, IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST THE PURE LOVE OF
NATURE.
I MEAN, BEING OUT THERE AND
BEING ABLE TO FEEL THE ENERGY
AND THE COMPLEXITY AND REALLY
FOR ME, THIS IS WHERE-- WE'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT GOD A LOT,
AND THIS IS WHERE I FIND GOD.
I GO THROUGHOUT AND I ABSOLUTELY
AM IN AWE OF THE WORLD THAT WE
LIVE IN.
AND TO GO OUT THERE AGAIN AND TO
REALLY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND I AS
A HUMAN BEING, THIS IS WHERE WE
COME FROM.
WE COME FROM NATURE AND TO GO
BACK AND SORT OF COMMUNE WITH
NATURE, IT'S THE CLOSEST THAT
I'VE EVER FELT LIKE I'VE EVER
BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH GOD.
AND TO ME, THIS IS WHERE GOD
LIVES.
Jeff: SO THIS WAS--
( APPLAUSE )
SO THIS WAS MORE ABOUT THE
ADVENTURE THAN THE MONEY?
WHERE DOES THE MONEY FALL IN
THERE?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY.
I WANT TO WIN!
( LAUGHTER ).
Jeff: DID YOU KNOW-- DID
YOU KNOW-- BECAUSE I REMEMBER
THAT FINAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT
WAS A NAIL BITER, AND AS YOU SAW
IT SLIPPING WHAT BECAUSE ALL OF
A SUDDEN SOPHIE HAD THREE AND
FOUR AND FIVE AND YOU'RE LOOKING
OVER AT HER GOING OH, MY GOD.
DID YOU KNOW A MILLION DOLLARS
WAS SLIPPING AWAY?
HELL YEAH.
SOPHIE IS-- SHE IS AMAZING.
I MEAN, SHE IS INCREDIBLY,
INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENCE INTEL
AND I KNEW THE ONLY ONE WHO
COULD POSSIBLY BEAT ME AT A
CHALLENGE-- NO OFFENSE, GUYS--
WAS SOPHIE.
SHE IS PHYSICALLY POWERFUL AND
MENTALLY SHE IS-- SHE'S ONE OF
THE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE THAT I
THINK HAS PLAYED THIS GAME.
AND --
HERE'S THE QUESTION I HAVE,
AND THIS ISN'T TO TAKE ANYTHING
AWAY FROM SOPHIE'S WIN.
BUT YOU DOMINATE, DOMINATE,
DOMINATE, DOMINATE.
YOU'RE OUT ON REDEMPTION.
YOU DOMINATED THIS GAME
CHALLENGE-WISE, AS WELL AS
ANYBODY, AND THEN A PUZZLE COMES
UP.
YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER, IS THERE
ANY-- IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU
THAT WAS EITHER EXHAUSTED OR
JUST SABOTAGED YOURSELF OR DID
YOU JUST GET BEAT BY SOMEBODY
WHO WAS BETTER THAT DAY?
YOU KNOW, I HAD A-- YOU CAN'T
QUITE TELL, BUT I HAD A PRETTY
HUGE LEAD.
AND REALLY BELIEVE IT'S
EITHER A SUBCONSCIOUS THING OR I
JUST EYE BEAT MYSELF.
YOU KNOW.
I DIDN'T FOCUS IN THE TIME I
NEEDED TO.
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST
SLIPPED AWAY.
I-- I WENT COMPLETELY BLANK, AND
IT WAS-- IT WAS LIKE I WAS
HAVING AN OUT-OF-BODY
EXPERIENCE.
AND I JUST HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR
WHAT IT IS, AND I REALLY
BELIEVE-- IF I HAD WON THE MONEY
AND I MIGHT-- YOU GUYS MIGHT
NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.
I MIGHT END UP LIVING ON A
DESERTED ISLAND SOMEWHERE WITH
THAT MONEY.
BUT NOW I HAVE TO WORK HARD.
I'VE GOT IT KEEP DOING WHAT I'M
AGO AND I'VE GOT TO KEEP, YOU
KNOW, LIVING MY LIFE IN THE WAY
THAT I LOVE TO DO IT.
YOU KNOW, IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT
THE MONEY.
FOR ME IT NEVER REALLY HAS BEEN
ABOUT THE MONEY.
IT'S BEEN ABOUT JUST GOING OUT
THERE AND PLAY AS GOOD A GAME AS
I EVER COULD PLAY.
THE FEAR FOR ME IS SOMETHING
THAT I HAD WHEN I FIRST STARTED
"SURVIVOR."
I KNEW THAT I WAS A GOOD PLAYER.
BUT I STILL WAS AFRAID OF
NATURE.
I STILL WAS AFRAID.
AND I REALIZED THAT YOU REALLY
DON'T NEED TO BE AFRAID.
FOR ALL THE KIDS OUT THERE, ONE
OF THE BIGGEST LESSONS THAT I'VE
EVER LEARNED-- AND I LEARNED IN
FROM SKATEBOARDING OF ALL
THINGS-- IS HOW TO FALL DOWN AND
HOW TO GET BACK UP.
IF YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO FALL
DOWN IN A GRACEFUL AND HUMBLE
BEL WAY, YOU CAN GET BACK UP AND
DO IT AGAIN.
FOR ME, TRUST ME, FALLING DOWN
IN FRONT OF MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE,
WHEN I HAVE THAT PRESSURE-- I
KNOW EVERYBODY HERE IS GOING TO
GIVE ME THE MONEY IF I CAN MAKE
IT THERE.
I KNOW EVERYBODY OUT THERE-- NOT
EVERYBODY.
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE NOT ROOTING FOR ME-- BUT
A LOT OF PEOPLE ROOTING FOR ME
AND THAT WEIGHT ON ME WAS JUST
TOO MUCH.
Jeff: ONE GUY WHO WASN'T
ROOTING FOR YOU WAS COCHRAN IN
THE SWEATER VEST.
ANY REGRETS ABOUT HOW THAT
PLAYED OUT?
THAT WAS, OBVIOUSLY, A MAJOR
TURNING POINT IN THE GAME.
IT WAS.
I MEAN, THE ONLY REGRET I COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE HAD IS MAYBE JUST
NOT GIVING COCHRAN THE IDOL AT
THAT POINT.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE-- I REALLY
FEEL LIKE I DID EVERYTHING I
POSSIBLY COULD HAVE DONE BESIDES
GIVING HIM THAT IDOL.
I THINK NOT HAVING THE IDOL IS
MAYBE WHAT MADE YOU AFRAID OF
DRAWING THE ROCKS.
AND I JUST-- I JUST WANTED TO
PLAY, THIS BEING MY LAST TIME, I
WANTED IT TO BE THE CRAZIEST
GAME I PLAYED.
THAT'S WHY I WAS WILLING TO GIVE
THE IDOL UP.
THAT'S WHY I WAS WILLING TO GO
TO REDEMPTION.
THAT'S WHY I WAS WILLING TO PUT
MY LIFE ON THE LINE.
I WANTED TO WIN.
I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY FOR
SECOND, THIRD.
Jeff: I'M GOING TO WHERE
YOU WANT INTRUPT YOU FOR A
SECOND--
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH, GIVE HIM A ROUND OF
APPLAUSE.
ONE THE OF THE MOST COMMON
QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED THIS
SEASON BY ME WHEN I WAS-- WOULD
BE OUT AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP
TO ME IS THE ONE THAT YOU ASKED
ME A FEW HOURS AGO WHEN WE WERE
TALKING BEFORE THE SHOW.
YOU HAD A QUESTION FOR OZZY.
I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU DO
IT, LIKE, HOW YOU CLIMB THE
TREES AND HOLD YOUR BREATH
UNDERWATER FOR THAT LONG?
IT JUST SEEMS PHYSICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE.
Jeff: THAT IS THE QUESTION
THAT EVERYBODY SAYS IS.
DOES HE REALLY GET TO THE TOP OF
A TREE?
IS HE REALLY UNDERWATER FOR
THREE OR FOUR MINUTES?
NOBODY'S EVER DONE THAT LIKE YOU
AND 400 PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED THIS
GAME OVER 23 SEASONS.
IS IT A NATURAL THING?
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT IT IS
IS JUST NOT BEING AFRAID.
NOT BEING AFRAID.
YOU'RE AT THE PERFECT AGE.
FOR ALL THE KIDS OUT THERE, YOU
GUYS.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS YOU
WANT TO DO.
AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO FALL
DOWN.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO FAIL BECAUSE
YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU REALLY CAN.
JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO IT.
YOU'RE AT THE RIGHT AGE.
Jeff: THANKS, ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION.
YES.
IF IF YOU ARE SMALL AND FALL
DOWN, IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH.
Jeff: SOME SEE HIM AS A
LIKABLE UNDERDOG, OTHERS, A
DESPICABLE VILLAIN.
EITHER WAY, FROM DAY ONE, WHEN
HE ASKED ME TO CALL HIM BY HIS
LAST NAME, COCHRAN WANT OUT TO
MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF.
MY ACHILLES' HEEL IS
CRIPPLING INSECURITY AND
ANXIETY.
I'M STARTING TO GET CONCERNED
ABOUT MY FATE.
Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU CAN'T
CATCH A BREAK.
I CAME TO PLAY "SURVIVOR."
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT BIG MOVES.
UP TO THIS POINT, MY FATE HAS
BEEN HANDED TO OTHER PEOPLE.
Jeff: OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
FIRST YOU GET THE EGOMANIAC
AND THEN THE MILLION DOLLARS.
I'M SO CLOSE.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: COCHRAN, I WANT TO
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH
YOU, BUT RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S BEEN THE
REACTION ON THE STREET BECAUSE
YOU POLARIZED PEOPLE.
SOME PEOPLE LOVE YOU.
OTHER PEOPLE HATE HATE YOU.
YOUNG PEOPLE SEEM TO LOVE YOU,
ADULTS THINK YOU MADE A TERRIBLE
MOVE.
ON THE STREET, PEOPLE ARE
GENERALLY NOT GOING TO APPROACH
YOU.
AND I GO TO THE INTERNET LIKE AN
OBSESSIVE FREAK AND EVERYBODY
HATES ME.
Jeff: WE'LL TALK TO COCHRAN
WHEN WE COME BACK, AND ALSO,
BRANDON, HIS "SURVIVOR"
EXPERIENCE BROUGHT OUT THE BEST
AND THE WORST.
IT WAS AS HE SAID A BATTLE OF
GOOD VERSUS EVIL.
PLUS, UNCLE RUSSELL HANTZ IS
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS OPINION.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: SO COCHRAN, A LOT OF
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS ABOUT
YOU, BUT AT HARVARD YOU ACTUALLY
WROTE A PAPER ON THE "SURVIVOR"
JURY SYSTEM AND COMPARED IT TO
OUR AMERICAN JUDICIAL JURY
SYSTEM.
SO YOU HAD A LOT OF THEORY ABOUT
HOW "SURVIVOR" WAS PLAYED.
PLAYING THE GAME, THOUGH,
ACTUALLY BEING OUT THERE, IS
VERY DIFFERENT.
WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SHOCK?
THE BIGGEST SHOCK IS THAT MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THE THEORY AND
HAVING WATCHED EVERY SINGLE
EPISODE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
ONCE YOU GET OUT THERE BECAUSE
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE PUT
WITH.
AND I GET OUT THERE, I
IMMEDIATELY FEEL INSECURE.
I HEAR MY NAME BEING FLOAT
AROUND IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS
AND FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN
OBSESSED WITH THE SHOW FOR 11
YEARS, THAT'S TERRIFYING.
IT'S PETRIFYING.
I GOT IN THIS DEFENSIVE POSTURE
THAT BASICALLY LASTED THE ENTIRE
GAME WHICH ISN'T A HEALTHY WAY
TO PLAY THE GAME IF YOU'RE
TRYING TO ESTABLISH TRUST AND
RAPPORT PEOPLE IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE FREAKING OUT ALL THE TIME.
I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT BUT I
DIDN'T REMEDY IT.
Jeff: WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE
FOR YOU BECAUSE AS WE TALKED
ABOUT BEFORE YOU BREAK, SOME
PEOPLE LOVE YOU, OTHERS HATE YOU
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T
LIKE YOU ARE SITTING NEXT TO
YOU, ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU,
BECAUSE YOU WERE PART OF THEIR
BEING OUSTED.
WAS THAT HARD ON YOU?
YOU'RE A REAL PERSON BUT YOU
BECOME A CHARACTER ON THIS SHOW.
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M LIKE A CHARACTER IN REAL
LIFE, TOO.
I MEAN--
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S HARD IT-- I CAN'T PLAY AN
UNDER-THE-RADAR GAME BECAUSE I'M
PERPETUALLY OVER THE RADAR
FREAKING OUT ALL THE TIME.
Jeff: SO EMOTIONALLY WAS IT
HARD FOR YOU?
YEAH, IT'S DIFFICULT.
BECAUSE I THINK-- I FANCIED
MYSELF A "SURVIVOR" EXPERT.
I KIND OF COME IN AND I AM A
JESTER
WHO IS THIS JOKE?
WE HAD HIGH HOPES FOR HIM.
I FEEL LIKE I DISAPPOINTED A LOT
OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF.
I DIDN'T REALLY PLAY THE GAME
LIKE SOME STRATEGIC MASTERMIND
LIKE I THOUGHT I WOULD.
HAVING NEGATIVE REACTIONS
WHETHER ONLINE OR TRIBEMATES EYE
LOVE EVERYBODY NOW BY THE WAY.
IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.
IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE I LIKE
TO BE LIKED.
THAT'S THE PERVERTED THING.
AT THE TIME TIME I'M THINKING
I'M PLAYING THE GREATEST SOCIAL
GAME OF ALL TIME.
EVERYBODY ADORES ME.
AND THEN I SEE SOPHIE
ENVISIONING MY HEAD ON A BRANCH
CHOPPING WITH A MACHETE SAYING
I'M THE MOST ANNOYING FREAK IN
THE UNIVERSE.
SO IT WAS --
HOW DID THIS GAME CHANGE YOU?
I MEAN IT CHANGED ME PROBABLY
IN MORE WAYS THAN I'M AWARE OF
BUT ONE I'M VERY AWARE OF,
OBVIOUSLY I'M A SOCIALLY ANXIOUS
GUY.
SEVEN MONTHS AGO, GOING TO A BAR
OR PARTY I GET NERVOUS.
I FREAK OUT, ON THE VERGE OF A
PANIC ATTACK.
BUT NOW I PUT MYSELF THROUGH THE
MOST SOCIALLY UNCOMFORTABLE,
PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNPLEASANT
EXPERIENCE YOU CAN IMAGINE AND
IT'S BEING BROADCAST TO MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE FUN OF
YOU AND RIDICULE YOU.
IT MAKES REAL-WORLD INTERACTIONS
SEEM LIKE NOTHING.
( LAUGHTER ).
( APPLAUSE )
YES OR NO--
( APPLAUSE )
ONE LAST QUESTION JUST A YES OR
NO ANSWER BECAUSE I WANT TO GET
TO BRANDON.
I SAID TO YOU WHEN IT WAS OVER,
I SAID I KNOW YOU'RE NOT DATING
NOW BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE.
ARE YOU DATING, YES OR NO?
NO.
Jeff: WAIT A MINUTE!
NOBODY?
NO, NOBODY.
JUST COME AT ME.
( LAUGHTER )
COME AT ME.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL ON
THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM IS
BRANDON.
AND, BRANDON, YOU KIND OF SAID
IT YOURSELF BEST.
YOU SAID-- I MEAN IT WAS
RIVETTING TO WATCH YOU
GOOD-EACH, GOOD-EVIL, GOOD-EVIL.
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
WHAT IS THE EVIL?
WHAT WAS TORMENTING YOU OUT
THERE?
OH, MAN, I LIVED A PRETTY
ROUGH PAST.
AND I'VE ALWAYS, LIKE I SAID, I
GREW UP IN THE CHURCH, AND MY
DAD'S TAUGHT ME TO DO THE RIGHT
THINGS, AND I'M STRAIGHT OFF
FROM THAT.
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A WIFE AND
KIDS AND I'VE-- I MADE A
DECISION THAT I'M GOING TO START
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AND IT WAS KIND OF HARD BECAUSE
I KEPT ON, I GUESS, BEING
REMINDED OF THE THINGS I USED TO
DO AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT I NEVER WAS THAT PERSON
AGAIN.
AND ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF SO
MANY PEOPLE.
I DIDN'T WANT NOBODY TO KNOW WHO
I
USED TOO-- WHO I WAS.
AND IT'S-- YOU KNOW --
IT'S TOUGH ON A GAME LIKE
"SURVIVOR."
SO WHAT'S THE REACTION WHEN YOU
GET BACK HOME, WHEN YOUR UNCLE,
RUSSELL, THE MOST NOTORIOUS
VILLAIN EVER, AS YOU SAID,
DESTROYED OUR FAMILY NAME, YOU
GET HOME, ARE THEY HAPPY WITH
HOW YOU PLAYED?
IT WAS, UNFORTUNATELY, NOT
EVERYBODY IS HAPPY.
( LAUGHTER )
ESPECIALLY RUSSELL.
SO NO, I MEAN, I-- I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO--
( APPLAUSE )
I'VE ALWAYS, HONESTLY, WANTED TO
--
CUT TO IT, BRANDON.
WHAT WAS THE REACTION WHEN YOU
GOT HOME?
IT SUCKED, BRO.
IT WAS BAD.
I-- I-- NOBODY REALLY ACCEPTED
ME THE WAY WANTED TO.
Jeff: NOBODY FROM YOUR
FAMILY.
NOBODY FROM MY FAMILY.
I MEAN, I --
IS ANYBODY HERE FROM YOUR
FAMILY?
NO, NO, SIR.
Jeff: NOBODY'S HERE FROM
YOUR FAMILY?
NO, SIR.
WE LOVE YOU, BRANDON!
NOT TO SAY THAT-- THAT MY
FAMILY-- SOME PEOPLE COULDN'T
MAKE IT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS, BUT I DON'T THINK A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF
ME.
YOU KNOW.
AND IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
BECAUSE I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO
KIDS OF MY OWN.
Jeff: WHO LOVE YOU.
WHO CARE ABOUT ME.
Jeff: I WANT TO GO.
LET'S GO TALK TO THE--
( APPLAUSE )
THE MOST NOTORIOUS VILLAIN IN
THE HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR."
COME ON, STAND UP, HANTZ.
( APPLAUSE )
GET ALL MOVIE STAR ON ME.
YOU JUST-- YOU WATCHED BRANDON
PLAY.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID IS
I WANT TO RESTORE THE HANTZ
FAMILY NAME.
DO YOU THINK HE DID, DID THAT?
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY,
I AM UNCLE RUSSELL.
THAT'S A SIDE OF ME THAT YOU
KNOW.
BUT I'M ALSO RUSSELL FROM
"SURVIVOR."
SO I WILL SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP
IF YOU WANT ME TO SIT DOWN AND
SHUT UP.
IF YOU WANT ME TO CRITIQUE YOUR
GAME, I'M DO THAT AS WELL.
Jeff: I WANT YOU TO
CRITIQUE THE GAME.
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS.
GO.
I THINK HE WENT OUT THERE TO
CHANGE SOMETHING THAT-- THAT I
BROUGHT TO THE GAME.
I MADE GREATNESS.
I BROUGHT THE GAME TO A LEVEL
THAT IS-- YOU CAN'T EVEN
COMPREHEND.
Jeff: WHAT DID BRANDON DO
WRONG?
EVERYTHING.
HE DIDN'T DO ONE THING RIGHT.
HE WENT OUT THERE
( AUDIENCE BOOING )
HE WENT OUT THERE TO CHANGE THE
HANTZ NAME.
TO CHANGE WHAT I DID?
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
SENSE TO ME.
Jeff: I JUST GOT IT.
I KNOW WHAT NEXT SEASON IS.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU LIKE THIS.
RUSSELL ON ONE TRIBE, BRANDON ON
THE OTHER
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
UP NEXT, SPRINT IS GOING TO
AWARD $100,000 TO THE SEASON'S
FAVORITE CASTAWAY BASED ON YOUR
VOTES.
IT'S NOT YOU, SIT DOWN.
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO CHECK IN
WITH SOME OF THE OTHERS.
IT'S THE LIVE SHOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jeff: SINCE WEDNESDAY, VIEWS
HAVE BEEN TEXTING AND VOTING
ONLINE FOR THE SPRINT PLAYER OF
THE SEASON, THE HONOR ALSO
INCLUDING $100,000 CASH PRIZE.
I'M GUESSING I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO ASK.
WHO DOES THE AUDIENCE THINK IT
IS?
OZZY!
Jeff: BY THE BIGGEST
MARGIBLE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS
AWARD, COCHRAN, YOU WERE SECOND,
AND NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE
WINNER, WHO WAS OZZY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: A LITTLE BIT OF
REDEMPTION.
I WANT TO POP AROUND A LITTLE
BIT.
DAWN, A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKED TO
ME DURING THE SEASON ABOUT YOU,
MOTHER OF SIX, ADOPTED KIDS,
MORMON FAMILY, OUT HERE.
YOU-- I KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU.
YOU TRANSFORMED YOUR BODY TO BE
ON THIS SHOW.
YOU DID A LOT OF THINGS TO GET
ON HERE.
WHAT'S THE THING YOU TOOK AWAY
FROM IT?
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
CHALLENGE YOURSELF, NO MATTER
WHAT AGE YOU ARE.
OZZY TALKS A LOT ABOUT KIDS.
I THINK MY EXPERIENCE ON THE
TRIBE WITH OZZY TAUGHT ME YOU'VE
GOT TO FACE CHALLENGES, BIG
ONES, AND THE BIGGER THE BETTER.
I EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT
"SURVIVOR" TO ME WAS JUST THIS
BIG OUT-THERE DREAM GOAL AND IT
WAS REALLY TOO BIG.
I HAD NO RIGHT ASKING FOR THAT
GOAL AND I WENT FOR IT ANYWAY.
AND THE KIND OF JOY AND GROWTH
THAT CAME FROM THAT MADE IT ALL
THE BETTER.
SO IT'S ABOUT CHALLENGING
YOURSELF.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: WHITNEY AND KEITH, I
WANT TO-- AND I DON'T KNOW IF A
LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE
A COUPLE.
IT'S BEEN PUB LISIZED IF PEOPLE
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.
AND, WHITNEY, YOU WERE IN A
RELATIONSHIP WHEN THE SHOW
STARTED, YOU WERE IN ANOTHER
RELATIONSHIP.
YOU COME ON TO THIS.
IT'S ONLY 39 DAYS.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS SHOW THAT
CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO
QUICKLY AND HAVE IT LAST?
WELL, LIKE SOPHIE SAID, IT'S
A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.
I MEAN, YOU'RE IN SUCH A
STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT, AND YOU
HAVE TO TRUST STRANGER, AND YOU
BECOME REALLY CLOSE REALLY
QUICK.
I MEAN, KEITH WAS IN MY FIRST
ALLIANCE WITH HIM AND OZZY, AND
I TRUSTED HIM 100% DAY ONE.
Jeff: IF THIS WERE A DATING
SHOW, THIS IS A CONDENSED--
THIS IS THE ONE.
I'M JUST GLAD SHE CHOSE ME
AND NOT OZZY.
Jeff: AND, EDNA, YOU SAID
SOMETHING TO ME DURING A
COMMERCIAL BREAK THEY THOUGHT
WAS REALLY FUNNY ABOUT HOW
PEOPLE CHANGE AND HOW THEY SEE
YOU DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU CAME
HOME.
YOU SAID, "I CAME HOME AND MY
HUSBAND SAW ME SO DIFFERENTLY
THAT, WHAT?"
I BECAME PREGNANT.
Jeff: HE JUST COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET HIS HANDS ON YOU?
YOU CHANGE NOT JUST YOURSELF
BUT YOUR FAMILY, TOO, AND YOU
LEARN TO APPRECIATE TO LEARN TO
BE AROUND PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU
AND I GUESS HE REALLY MISSED ME,
TOO.
Jeff: AND CHRISTINE IF YOU
WANT CORNERING A LOT OF PEOPLE
ROOTED FOR YOU.
YOU WERE OUT EARLY.
YOU PROMISED THAT COACH WAS A
SHORT-TIMER, AND YOU WEREN'T
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
BUT YOU DID A GREAT JOB ON
REDEMPTION.
THANKS.
Jeff: AND IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT YOU FORMED A VERY UNLIKELY
FRIENDSHIP WITH STACEY.
AND IS THAT FRIENDSHIP STILL
INTACT, STACEY?
YES, IT IS.
WE HAVE A CLOSE BOND.
WE CALL EACH OTHER SISSY OR SALT
AND PEPPER AND WE CALL EACH
OTHER EACH AND EVERY DAY.
Jeff: CHRISTINE WOULD YOU
HAVE EVER MET STACEY OTHERWISE?
YES, I THINK SO.
YEAH.
Jeff: YOUR PATHS MIGHT HAVE
CROSSED?
THEY POSSIBLY COULD HAVE,
YEAH.
Jeff: BRANDON, I WANT TO GO
BACK TO YOU, BECAUSE DURING THE
COMMERCIAL BREAK I WAS SITTING
HERE WATCHING YOU, AND I WAS
THINKING TO MYSELF I KIND OF
GLOSSED OVER IT A LITTLE BIT
WHEN I MADE THIS JOKE HEY, MAYBE
RUSSELL VERSUS BRANDON WOULD BE
FUN-- WHICH I THINK IT MIGHT BE
FUN.
BUT IS REALLY HOW IT IS
BACK HOME?
IS IT TRULY THAT YOUR FAMILY AND
RUSSELL THINK YOU DID A BAD JOB
AND NOW IT'S NOT GOOD AT HOME?
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ALL MY
FAMILY, BUT A BIG PORTION.
I'VE CAUGHT A LOT OF SLACK FROM
THESE GUYS THAT I DO CALL
FAMILY, THE HANTZS.
AND SOME OF THEM WERE-- WERE--
WERE PRETTY MUCH SO DISAPPOINTED
THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL THEY COULD
TALK ABOUT WAS HOW I DIDN'T LIVE
UP TO THE HANTZ-- HANTZ FAMILY
NAME.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
DISAPPOINTING THAT I CAN'T DO
THAT-- I CAN'T MAKE MY OWN
FAMILY HAPPY WITH ME, EVEN
THOUGH I GO OUT THERE AND I GO,
MAN, MY FAMILY'S GOING TO BE
PROUD OF ME, MAN.
I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY
PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS FAMILY.
AND I HAD THE GREATEST
INTENTIONS IN THE WORLD, BUT IT
ALL JUST-- IT-- YOU CAN'T WIN
FOR LOSING SOMETIMES.
Jeff: ARE YOU PROUD OF HOW
YOU PLAYED?
I'M-- I'M VERY PROUD OF HOW I
PLAYED.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: AND AS WE GO TO THE
BREAK, JIM, REALLY DISAPPOINTED
TO SEE YOU VOTED OUT EARLY.
I THINK YOU'RE-- I HAVE A SENSE
THAT YOU'RE A VERY GOOD PLAYER,
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO
DIFFERENTLY, OTHER THAN, YOU
KNOW, COCHRAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY IN
THIS GAME IF YOU PLAYED AGAIN
WHAT'S THE ADVICE?
WHAT'S THE ADVICE?
REALLY TRUST SOMEBODY'S
MOTIVATIONS.
LIKE OZZY SAID, I WAS THERE TO
WIN.
COCHRAN WAS THERE-- HE DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT WINNING.
YOU CAN'T STAB FIVE PEOPLE IN
THE BACK AND WIN THE GAME.
HE SAID HE'S A STUDENT OF THE
GAME AND HE'S NOT A STUDENT IN
THE GAME.
OR HE CAN'T COUNT.
YOU NEED FIVE VOTES TO WIN AND
YOU CAN"T STAB FIVE PEOPLE IN
THE BACK.
Jeff: YOU SAID TRUST HIS
MOTIVATION.
HIS MOTIVATION WAS TO LAST
LONGER AND NOT TO WIN.
MY MISTAKE WAS ASSUMING
EVERYBODY WAS PLAYING THE GAME
TO WIN.
Jeff: AFTER 23 SEASONS, 23
SEASONS!
( APPLAUSE )
WE'RE STILL GOING STRONG.
FIND OUT WHAT IS IN STORE FOR
NEXT SEASON.
PLUS I HAVE SOPHIE'S CHECK FOR A
MILLION DOLLARS.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU RIGHT AFTER
THIS.
BE RIGHT BACK.
( APPLAUSE ).
Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC" LIVE
REUNION SHOW.
IT'S NICE TO HAVE OUR COMPOSERS
THAT DO ALL THE MUSIC ON OUR
SHOW TO HAVE THEM HERE AT THE
LIVE SHOW.
GUYS, GIVE ME A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR THIS CHECK PRESENTATION.
A LITTLE SOMETHING-SOMETHING.
FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER DONE THIS.
I GET TO PRESENT A CHECK FOR A
MILLION DOLLARS WELL EARNED TO
SOPHIE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
TEAR THAT BABY OPEN.
THERE IT IS A MILLION DOLLARS.
NICE JOB.
ALL RIGHT.
A NEW ADVENTURE IS ABOUT TO
BEGIN.
OUR 24th SEASON IS JUST
AROUND THE CORNER, AND THERE'S A
NEW TWIST.
TAKE A LOOK.
FOR 23 SEASONS, "SURVIVOR" HAS
TRAVELED ACROSS THE PLANET,
TREACHEROUS OCEANS, MYSTERIOUS
JUNGLES, AND EPIC ISLANDS.
AS AMERICANS FROM ALL WALKS OF
LIFE FIGHT IT OUT FOR THE
MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE.
AND ONCE AGAIN, "SURVIVOR" IS
CHANGING THINGS UP.
THIS TIME, TWO TRIBES WILL
COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER WHILE
LIVING TOGETHER ON ONE ISLAND.
THEY'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER
TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES OR
LEAVE THE OTHER TRIBE TO FEND
FOR THEMSELVES.
AS THEY BATTLE IT OUT IN THE
GREATEST ADVENTURE ON TE
TELEVISION.
TWO TRIBES, ONE WORLD, ONE
SURVIVOR.
COMING IN FEBRUARY.
"SURVIVOR: ONE WORLD."
( APPLAUSE )
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TONIGHT'S
SHOW, YOU CAN BID ON
ONE-OF-A-KIND MEMORABILIA TO
BENEFIT THE CHARITY OPERATION
SMILE.
THE WEB SITE IS ON THE SCREEN
NOW.
FINALLY, IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO DO WHAT THEY
DID, PUT TOGETHER A THREE-MINUTE
THE DETAILS.
AND I SAY IT EVERY SEASON, THANK
YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
TO USE A COACH PHRASE, IT'S
BECAUSE OF YOU THAT WE'RE STILL
ON THE AIR.
SEE YOU IN FEBRUARY.
GOOD NIGHT.
