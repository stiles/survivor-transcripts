        Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": TWO HISTORIC PLAYERS
RETURN.
THIS TIME, I'M MORE MATURE.
I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME
TWICE.
I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY
MISTAKES.
I HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
I HAVE ALMOST BEEN THERE.
THIS IS ONE MORE SHOT.








I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOCK
MY LANDS ON THE MILLION DOLLARS.
I CAN OWN THIS GAME WITH
HONOR AND INTEGRITY.
â™ª
Jeff: WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR:
SOUTH PACIFIC."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TWO MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE
JOINING YOU IN THIS GAME.
THIS IS AN OUT-OF-BODY
EXPERIENCE FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE A BUG COLLECTION AT HOME.
I'M A HUGE FAN AND I'M THRILLED








TO SEE OZZY AND COACH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL MY HEART.
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPIER
THAT IT WAS OZZY THAT WAS IN MY
TRIBE.
OZZY!
FREAKING OZZY!
Jeff: COACH JOINS THE BLUE
TRIBE.
I DID NOT WANT TO SEE COACH'S
NAME BLEED BLUE.
I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN A DRAGON
SLAYER, AND THERE AIN'T NO
DRAGONS.
Jeff: DESPITE A CHILLY
RECEPTION ON DAY ONE, COACH WON
HIS TRIBE OVER WITH A
CONVERSATION ON THE FIRST NIGHT.
I GUARANTEE YOU THIS: IF YOU
HAVE A STRONG TRIBE THAT TRUST
EACH OTHER, IT IS AN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE NUT TO CRACK.
YOU HAVE GOT RICK, SOPHIE,
BRANDON, ALBERT AND YOU HAVE
MYSELF.
THE FIVE OF US ARE READY
TO DIE FOR EACH OTHER.
Jeff: THE COACH WASN'T DONE
YET.
COME ON, BABY.
COME TO ME.
COACH WADE HAS FOUND THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
A GOLDEN LITTLE GEM TO HOLD
ON TO.
Jeff: WITH A STRONG ALLIANCE
AND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,
COACH'S ONLY CONCERN WAS BEATING
THE SAVAII TRIBE.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK IN OUR
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY!
(CHEERS)
SAVAII WINS IMMUNITY!
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY.
SAVAII WINS.
UPOLU WINS!
WITH THE MERGE PENDING, OZZY
MADE THE BIGGEST MOVE YET.
I WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE
MYSELF, GO TO REDEMPTION, WIN
THE DUEL, AND GIVE OUR TRIBE AN
EDGE.
Jeff: OZZY WINS THE DUEL AND
IS BACK IN THIS GAME.
DROP YOUR BUFFS BECAUSE WE ARE
MERGED.
IT'S SIX ON SIX.
WE ARE EVEN NUMBERS.
Jeff: OZZY RETURNED TO THE
GAME, BUT COCHRAN, WHO NEVER FIT
IN ON SAVAII, THWARTED HIM WITH
AN EVEN BIGGER MOVE.
I CAN COMPLETELY JUMP SHIP,
BETRAY MY OWN TRIBE.
Jeff: EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC."
COWARD.
THAT'S HOW A WINNER PLAYS.
YOU DISGUST ME.
YOU THREW THE WHOLE TRIBE UNDER
THE BUS.
Jeff: OZZY, ONCE AGAIN, THE
TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
AT REDEMPTION ARENA, SAVAII WAS
FORCED TO BATTLE EACH OTHER.
OZZY STAYS ALIVE IN THIS GAME.
I WILL BE PUTTING EVERY LAST
OUNCE OF MY SOUL INTO
REDEMPTION.
I HOPE TO SEE ALL OF YOU
COMING THROUGH THERE, AND I'LL
MAKE YOU A NICE FISH AND SEND
YOU ON YOUR WAY.
Jeff: BEING STRANDED ON
REDEMPTION ISLAND ONLY MADE OZZY
STRONGER.
THIS IS HOW I'M PLAYING THE
SECOND HALF OF MY GAME.
AND THERE'S NO ONE BETTER SUITED
TO BE OUT HERE THAN ME.
BIGGEST FISH I'VE EVER CAUGHT.
Jeff: AND WHILE ON A REWARD
VISIT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,
COACH STRUCK A DEAL WITH HIM.
AS SOON AS YOU GET BACK FROM
REDEMPTION, I HAVE A PERFECT
FINAL THREE SCENARIO.
YOU, ME, ONE OTHER PERSON.
I'M GIVING YOU MY WORD AS A
CHRISTIAN MAN.
WHEN I SAY "AS A CHRISTIAN MAN,"
I PROMISE YOU THIS IS WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.
THAT'S AN IRREVOCABLE PROMISE.
Jeff: DESPITE HIS BARGAINING
WITH COACH, COCHRAN WAS SENT
PACKING.
JEEZ.
Jeff: JUST TAKE THE STEPS.
YEAH.
Jeff: AS WAS EDNA, LEAVING
THE ORIGINAL ALLIANCE OF FIVE
FORMED ON NIGHT ONE TO FINALLY
TURN ON EACH OTHER.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
DON'T YOU LIE, TOO.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
LISTEN, WILL YOU LET ME
(BLEEP) FINISH?
NO.
WHERE IS YOUR STRATEGIC MIND
NOW?
WE TAKE OUT SOPHIE NEXT.
I'M FEELING LIKE ALBERT
SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT.
COACH WILL NOT VOTE FOR ME.
BRANDON, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
I WANT TO GIVE MY IMMUNITY
NECKLACE UP.
Jeff: THINKING HE WAS SAFE,
BRANDON GAVE UP HIS IMMUNITY TO
PROTECT ALBERT.
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK HE'S
GOING HOME TONIGHT, SO I'M NOT
GOING TO GIVE HIM THE NECKLACE
BACK.
Jeff: BRANDON, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
BACK IN THIS GAME.
GRAB YOUR TORCH.
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHERE THINGS
STAND.
THE FOUR OF YOU WILL WITNESS THE
FINAL DUEL BETWEEN OZZY AND
BRANDON.
THE WINNER OF THE DUEL WILL
REENTER THE GAME, AND THE FIVE
OF YOU WILL DUKE IT OUT.
TONIGHT, SIX ARE LEFT STANDING.
I WANT TO CHANGE THE COURSE
OF MY FAMILY NAME.
IT IS TIME TO PERFORM, AND
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DO BEST.
SEE WHAT THE DRAGON SLAYER'S
GOT THIS TIME.
I'M THE BRAINS BEHIND THE
OPERATION.
I HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT DOING
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN THIS
GAME.
THERE'S BLOOD IN THE WATER.
WE'RE CIRCLING.
Jeff: IT IS THE ULTIMATE
CHALLENGE: BATTLING THE ELEMENTS
AND EACH OTHER.
IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
TO CLAIM THE MILLION-DOLLAR
PRIZE.
A MILLION DOLLARS FLOATING
AROUND RIGHT NOW.
ONE IN SIX SHOT.
Jeff: 39 DAYS, ONE SURVIVOR.
BEING THE SOLE SURVIVOR.
THERE'S NO SAFER TIME TO PULL
OUT ALL THE STOPS.
IT ALL COME DOWNS TO THIS.
Captioning brought to you by
Survivor Productions & CBS
WHAT'S UP, BRO?
OH!
DUDE, IT'S ME, BRO.
OH, MAN.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I GOT BLINDSIDED.
COACH, SOPHIE, AND RICK.
OH, MAN.
I FELL ON MY SWORD FOR ALBERT
LAST NIGHT, AND I WAS STABBED
WITH ANOTHER SWORD IN THE BACK,
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT
HURTS TO GET STABBED IN THE BACK
BY YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND, YOUR
BEST FRIEND, IT'S OKAY.
I MADE A COMMITMENT TO ALBERT.
I FORGIVE HIM.
I LOVE HIM, AND I HOPE HE LEARNS
FROM WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT.
OH, ACTUALLY, I WON IMMUNITY
TODAY.
WHAT?
BUT I HAD MADE A COMMITMENT
TO ALBERT AND I SAID I WAS GOING
TO STICK WITH IT.
AND YOU GAVE UP THE IMMUNITY
TO ALBERT?
YEAH, MAN.
I GAVE IT UP.
OH!
IT'S ALL GOOD, THOUGH, BRO.
HE WASN'T BLINDSIDED.
HE GAVE UP THE FREAKING IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
WHENEVER YOU GIVE UP IMMUNITY
NECKLACE, YOUR ASS IS GOING
HOME.
IF I LOSE TOMORROW I WANT YOU
TO REALLY GO OUT THERE AND GIVE
IT EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT, BRO.
BRANDON IS SUPPOSEDLY PLAYING
THIS LOYAL GAME WHEN IN FACT
HE'S PLAYING A BLIND FAITH GAME.
HE'S PLAYING THE GAME LIKE HE'S
PLAYING WITH GOD AND HE'S NOT.
HE'S PLAYING WITH HUMAN BEINGS
THAT ARE GREEDY AND WANT THAT
MONEY
TOMORROW IS A FRESH DAY.
IT IS, MAN, IT REALLY IS.
TRIBAL WAS CRAZY, BUT IT WAS
FANTASTIC.
BRANDON MADE ONE OF THE
STUPIDEST MOVES EVER TO BE MADE
AND GAVE HIS NECKLACE AWAY.
AND I THINK THE GREAT THING IS
THAT ALBERT NOT GIVING BACK THE
NECKLACE SEEMED LIKE A REALLY
COWARDLY MOVE IN FRONT OF THE
JURY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PASS
THE NECKLACE BACK TO BRANDON.
ALBERT.
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
LITTLEALIZE, AND IF THERE ARE
LITTLEALIZE, THEN THERE ARE
GOING TO BE BIG LIES.
ALBERT KNEW THAT BRANDON WAS
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
THERE'S NO SENSE FOR THAT LIE.
JUST OWN YOURSELF.
OWN YOUR ACTION.
I'M SICK OF PEOPLE COMING OUT
HERE AND TRYING TO LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE HOLIER THAN THOU.
WON'T STAND FOR ANY MORE OF THE
JURY POLITICKING, HAMMING IT UP
WITH THE OTHER SIDE.
I AM NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND
HAVE PEOPLE BULL ( BLEEP ) ME.
YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT GETTING IN
BED WITH THE SAVAII MEMBERS.
IF YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT JURY
JUMPING, LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING.
I'M NOT GOING HAVE IT!
WHEN PEOPLE BULL ( BLEEP ) ME,
YOU'RE CUT OFF.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE MADE A FOOL
OF OUT HERE.
I'VE BEEN MADE A FOOL OF ENOUGH
IN MY LIFE.
TODAY HAS BEEN THE MOST
HUMBLING DAY FOR ME AND HAS PUT
ME ON KIND OF A PRECARIOUS SPOT,
AND IF I CAN'T FIND A WAY TO
REPAIR MY ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW AND
GET BACK IN GOOD STANDING WITH
MY TRIBE, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO
GO IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, MAN.
IT'S A PIECE OF PIZZA!
I'LL LET YOU DO THE HONORS, MAN.
"TODAY IS THE DAY, YOUR FINAL
DUEL.
WHEN IT IS OVER, ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL RETURN TO THE GAME.
THE OTHER WILL JOIN THE JURY.
HANG OTHERE'S ONLY A FEW DAYS
LEFT."
HANG ON, BRO.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE, MY FRIEND.
HANG ON.
I'VE BEEN ON REDEMPTION ISLAND
FOR OVER TWO WEEKS.
I'VE BEEN FISHING BETTER THAN I
EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE.
I'VE BEEN EATING BETTER THAN I
HAVE IN ANY "SURVIVOR" GAME I'VE
EVER PLAYED.
I'VE BEEN PREPARING MYSELF FOR
THIS ONE DUEL, AND THEN TO GET
BACK IN THE GAME.
HANG ON.
YOU HANG OBRO.
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE LITTLE
MAN.
I NEVER UNDERESTIMATED YOU,
MAN.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST
COMPETITORS OF THE GAME.
REDEMPTION ISLAND HAS BECOME
HOME TO ME.
I LOVE IT HERE.
I REALLY DO.
I FOUND OUT THINGS ABOUT MYSELF
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED.
I CAN'T SAY I WON'T MISS THIS
PLACE BECAUSE I WILL.
I REALLY WILL MISS REDEMPTION,
BUT I'M ALSO SO EXCITED TO GET
BACK IN THE GAME AND GET BACK TO
REAL LIFE WITH POSSIBLY A
MILLION DOLLARS.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S
DUEL.
OZZY WILL BATTLE AGAINST
BRANDON.
SO LET'S GET THE BIG NEWS OUT OF
THE WAY.
THIS IS THE FINAL DUEL.
YOU SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON,
THE TWO OF YOU-- THE ONLY WAY TO
GET BACK INTO THIS GAME, WIN
TODAY'S DUEL.
TODAY'S DUEL IS VERY SIMPLE.
YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD ON TO A
POLE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
LAST PERSON LEFT HANGING ON THAT
POLE GETS BACK IN THIS GAME, AND
WE'LL-- WILL HAVE A ONE IN FIVE
SHOT OF WINNING THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
LOSER IS OUT, SEE YA, THE
SEVENTH MEMBER OF THE JURY.
THIS IS IT, YOUR FINAL SHOT.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
OKAY, YOU BOTH LOOK GOOD AND
SOLID.
THIS TH FINAL DUEL IS ON.
THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE.
YOU CANNOT HOLD ON TO THE TOP OF
THE POLE.
IT'S SHEER WILL POWER.
HOW MUCH PAIN CAN YOU WITHSTAND?
HOW MUCH PAIN CAN YOU WITHSTAND?
PROBABLY SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
UP THERE A LONG TIME.
IT'S BEEN EIGHT MINUTES.
WE HAVE NEVER DONE IT THIS WITH
NARROW OF A FOOTHOLD BEFORE.
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A QUARTER INCH
OF WOOD.
THERE'S NO HIDING IN THIS DUEL.
YOU'VE NOW BEEN UP THERE 20
MINUTES.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
Jeff: IT'S GOT TO SEEM LIKE
HOURS.
OZZY TRYING SOMETHING ALTOGETHER
DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW.
HANGING ON BY THE EDGE OF HIS
TOES.
BRANDON'S BEEN IN BASICALLY THE
SAME SPOT FOR MOST OF THIS DUEL.
STAY FOCUSED, MAN, STAY
FOCUSED.
Jeff: BRANDON GETTING
SUPPORT FROM HIS FORMER
TRIBEMATES.
OZZY GETTING NO LOVE, AS PER
USUAL OUT HERE.
40 MINUTES HANGING ON A POLE
FIGHTING FOR A SHOT TO GET BACK
IN THIS GAME.
OZZY READJUSTING ONCE AGAIN.
EVERY MOVE IS A RISK.
OZZY'S STARTING TO LOSE IT,
MAN.
Jeff: BRANDON TRYING TO
READJUST.
UH-OH.
Jeff: BRANDON WITH A NICE
RECOVERY, NOW HANGING ON WITHOUT
ANY FOOTHOLDS.
THE KID'S' FREAKING WARRIOR,
MAN.
BOTH GUYS MOVING AROUND A LOT
NOW.
BOTH GUYS DIGGING DEEP.
A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH,
WATCHING THE OTHER GUY, LOOKING
FOR SOME SIGNAL THAT MAYBE HE'S
GETTING TIRED.
YOU ARE HANGING ON FOR YOUR LIFE
IN THIS GAME.
PUSH IT, KID, PUSH IT.
Jeff: BRANDON SLIDING DOWN.
OZZY HANGING ON BY HIS INNER
THIGHS, NOW.
THIS IS CRAZY.
Jeff: BRANDON STARTING TO
SLIDE A LITTLE MORE.
YOU HAVE TO DIG RIGHT NOW,
BRANDON.
PUSH IT, MAN, PUSH IT.
Jeff: BRANDON IS ABOUT FOUR
FEET AWAY FROM BEING OUT OF THE
GAME FOR GOOD.
BRANDON IS OUT OF THE DUEL AND
OUT OF THE GAME.
OZZY STAYS ALIVE AND IS BACK IN
THIS GAME WAY SHOT AT THE
MILLION DOLLARS.
THANK YOU, FATHER.
( APPLAUSE )
Jeff: BRANDON, 36 OF THE
MOST EMOTIONAL, WEARING IT ON
YOUR SLEEVE DAYS I'VE EVER SEEN
ANYBODY GO THROUGH OUT HERE.
YOU SEEM JUBILANT, EVEN THOUGH
YOU JUST LOST.
I MAY HAVE LOST THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR," BUT I'VE WON.
IN THE BEGINNING I CAME OUT HERE
TO WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.
BUT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS IN, I HAD A
HEART TO HEART WITH GOD.
I HOLD NO BITTERNESS TOWARDS
NOBODY AND I'M GOING TO HOLD MY
HEAD UP PROUD.
Jeff: BRANDON, THIS
ADVENTURE FOR YOU HAS COME TO AN
END.
YOU BECOME THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY.
YES, SIR.
Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF.
LOVE YOU, GUYS.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BRO.
LOVE YOU, BROTHER.
Jeff: OZZY, BEEN AN
UNDERDOG FROM DAY ONE AND HERE
ARE YOU BACK IN THIS GAME ON DAY
36.
I HAVE TO THANK THEM,
ACTUALLY, FOR SENDING ME TO
REDEMPTION.
I SPENT THE LAST 15 DAYS JUST
PUSHING MYSELF EVERY SINGLE DAY
WITH THE HOPES THAT IF I DO MAKE
IT BACK TO THIS FINAL STRETCH
THAT I'LL COME HARDER THAN I
HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO IN THIS
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."
Jeff: HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.
THE FIVE OF YOU TOGETHER GOING
BACK TO CAMP.
YOU'LL AWAIT NEWS HAVE A TREE
MAIL OF YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
WATCHING THE GUYS IN THE
DUEL, BRANDON WAS GOING LIKE A
MANIAC.
I GUESS THE TERRIFYING THING WAS
OZZY WAS STILL ABLE TO BEAT HIM.
AND IF OZZY KEEPS WINNING
IMMUNITY, THERE'S REALLY ONLY SO
MUCH I CAN DO.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
IT'S DEFINITELY STRANGE TO
HAVE OZZY BACK IN OUR MIDST.
IT'S US FOUR VERSUS HIM.
WE ALL KNOW WE WANT HIM OUT.
HE MUST KNOW WE WANT HIM OUT.
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
BUT GO INTO THE NEXT CHALLENGE
AND BEAT HIS BUTT.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
YOU HAVE MADE AN AMAZING RUN.
THANK YOU.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING
ANYWHERE.
AND I KNOW THAT-- YOU KNOW, FOR
ME, IF I WERE TO WIN IMMUNITY,
THEN, I'VE GOT THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE, AND I'VE GOT THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
IT'S--
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'LL GIVE ME
ONE OF THOSE IF YOU WIN?
IF I THINK YOU'RE IN
JEOPARDY, ABSOLUTELY.
AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK FROM
THE CHALLENGE, COACH WANTS TO
TALK DEALS.
COACH WANTS TO SAY I STILL WANT
TO TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL THREE.
I'M LIKE, OKAY, COACH, WHATEVER
YOU SAY, MAN.
SURE.
DO I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT HE
WANTS TO TAKE ME?
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD
WANT TO TAKE ME TO THE END RIGHT
NOW?
AFTER BATTLING FROM REDEMPTION
AND COMING BACK OF EIGHT PEOPLE
STRAIGHT?
COME ON.
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS WIN.
I'VE BEEN BATTLING AND BATTLING
AND SO HAVE YOU.
I STILL THINK THAT THIS GAME
SHOULD BE OURS.
I REALLY DO.
AND I STILL WANT TO TAKE YOU TO
THE END.
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE WAY IT
SHOULD BE.
I FEEL LIKE YOU DESERVE TO BE
IN THIS GAME.
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT
REALLY WANTS TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITH OZZY.
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT
REALLY WANTS TO GET TO THE END
WITH OZZY.
BUT I THINK THAT MY ALIGNMENTS
IN THIS GAME ARE SO SECURE WITH
SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, THAT
RIGHT NOW, IT'S LIKE IN THE
NBA FINALS AND I'M UP BY 14 AND
THERE'S FOUR MINUTES LEFT ON THE
CLOCK.
HOW YOU FEELING.
IF WE WIN THE NEXT CHALLENGE,
HE'LL GO.
YEAH, MAN, WE HAVE TO.
IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE.
THIS IS MY GAME TO LOSE RIGHT
NOW AND THE REASON WHY I SAY
THAT IS BECAUSE RICKMENTS TO
TAKE ME TO THE FINAL THREE.
SOPHIE WANTS TO TAKE ME TO THE
FINAL THREE.
AMBERT WANTS TO TAKE ME TO THE
FINAL THREE.
AS YOU WANTS TO TAKE ME TO THE
FINAL THREE.
IT'S MY GAME TO LOSE.
IT'S MY GAME TO LOSE.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS RADS TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
YOU BET.
YUP.
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ALBERT, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, WITH ONE
HAND, YOU WILL STEADY A
BALANCING BOARD WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILDING A HOUSE
OF CARDS WITH THE OTHER HAND.
FIRST PERSON TO BUILD A STACK OF
CARDS HIGH ENOUGH TO REACH THE
FINISH MARK WINS IMMUNITY, IS
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT AND WITHOUT REDEMPTION
ISLAND, YOU WILL GO STRAIGHT
INTO THE JURY, BECOMING THE
EIGHTH MEMBER.
HUGE STAKES.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR
HANDLE, GET FAMILIAR WITH YOUR
BALANCING BOARD.
FEEL THAT WEIGHT.
SEE WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO
HOLD IT STEADY.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD
AND LEVEL.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
ONE CARD AT A TIME.
FIRST PERSON TO BUILD THEIR
STACK TALL ENOUGH TO REACH THE
FINISH MARK WINS IMMUNITY.
ANYBODY DO HOUSE OF CARDS FOR
FUN?
I DO.
Jeff: YOU DO, SOPHIE.
I HAVE A BOOK HOW TO MAKE
THEM.
Jeff: YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
WILL COME IN HANDY ON DAY 37 ON
"SURVIVOR."
OZZY, COACH, AND SOPHIE, ALL
THREE DOING A NICE JOB.
COACH AND OZZY ARE ABOUT EVEN.
ALBERT NOWHERE.
RICK, NOWHERE.
SOPHIE IS BUILDING A STRUCTURE
THAT LOOKS INDESTRUCTIBLE.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PIECES LEFT.
Jeff: SOPHIE HAD A GREAT
STRATEGY BUT SHE'S USED TOO MANY
PIECES.
PART OF THIS IS DEFINITELY TILE
MANAGEMENT.
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE HERS
APART NOW.
THAT GIVES OZZY A LITTLE BIT OF
BREATHING ROOM, OPENS THE DOOR
FOR COACH.
OUT OF NOWHERE, COACH'S STACK
FALLS.
OZZY IS NOW IN THE LEAD.
SOPHIE TRYING A NEW STRATEGY,
AND IS QUICKLY GAINING ON OZZY
AGAIN.
WILL SHE HAVE ENOUGH TILES TO
GET THERE?
OZZY WITH HIS LAST PIECE.
NOT GOING TO DO IT.
OZZY IS GOING TO HAVE IT TEAR
DOWN HIS STACK AND COME UP WITH
A NEW STRATEGY.
COACH QUICKLY REBUILDING.
ALBERT GETTING SOMETHING GOING
NOW.
RICK STARTING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
OZZY HAS COMPLETELY GIVEN UP THE
LEAD.
HE IS TAKING HIS ENTIRE STACK
APART.
SOPHIE GETTING CLOSER.
SOPHIE NOW IN THE LEAD.
AND WITH THAT, SOPHIE LOSES HALF
OF HER STACK.
HEY, ALBERT, DROP YOUR STACK
AND COME PICK UP MY PEATSES.
I'M NAY PRETTY DECENT SPOT.
DROP YOUR DAM STACK AND PICK
UP MY PIECES.
I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU.
ALBERT, DROP YOUR STACK!
Jeff: LET ME MAKE IT EASY
FOR YOU.
THERE IS NO HELPING IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
IT WAS DESIGNED AS AN INDIVIDUAL
CHALLENGE.
IT WILL BE PLAYED AS AN
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE.
IF YOU WANT OZZY OUT OF THIS
GAME, BEAT HIM.
COACH NOT PANICKING AT ALL.
HE'S DROPPED HIS STACK BUT HAS
REBUILT IT AND IS BACK IN THIS.
OZZY GETTING RISKIER WITH HIS
STACK.
SO IS SOPHIE.
SOPHIE LOSES HALF OF HER STACK
AGAIN.
NO NEED TO PANIC EVER IN THIS
CHALLENGE.
ANYBODY'S STACK COULD FALL AT
ANY TIME.
COACH NICE AND STEADY IN THE
LEAD.
OZZY, HE'S GETTING CLOSER.
OZZY VERY CLOSE TO THE FINISH.
COACH VERY CLOSE TO THE FINISH.
WE ARE DEAD EVEN AT THIS POINT.
ALBERT LOSES HIS ENTIRE STACK.
SOPHIE GOT TO GET BACK IN THIS.
OZZY NOW IN THE LEAD.
COACH RIGHT BEHIND.
OZZY TOOK DOWN NEARLY HIS ENTIRE
STACK TO START OVER.
HE HAS NOW REBUILT IT AND IS
WITHIN INCHES OF WINNING
IMMUNITY.
OZZY IS ONE TILE AWAY FROM
WINNING IMMUNITY.
OZZY WINS IMMUNITY.
OZZY WINS IMMUNITY.
OZZY, COME ON OVER.
( APPLAUSE )
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jeff: YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AFTER 37 DAYS, COACH, RICK,
SOPHIE, ALBERT, ONE OF YOU FROM
THIS TIGHT GROUP OF FOUR GOING
HOME TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
I BUILT THE BASE AND JUST DID
TWO, TWO, TWO, TWO, TWO.
I ONLY HAD, LIKE, THREE OR FOUR
PIECES LEFT.
THE TOWER WAS SO TALL, IT WAS
WOBBLING.
IF YOU MOVED A LITTLE BIT, IT
WOULD-- THAT WAS IT.
SO I JUST GOT THEM UP AND
FOCUSED.
I'VE BEEN HERE 37 CASE AND I AM
GOING TO BE A FACILITATOR IN
THAT PROCESS.
IT FEELS GOOD.
I'VE GOT THE NECKLACE.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING HOME, SO
I'M TRYING TO PIT EVERY SINGLE
PERSON AGAINST EACH OTHER NOW,.
IT'S AMAZING.
I THOUGHT SOPHIE WAS GONNA HAVE
IT.
ACTUALLY, I WAS AT THE TOP
TWICE.
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.
IT'S GUT WRENCHING.
WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
BUT LOYALTIES WILL BE BROKEN
TONIGHT.
IT'S PRETTY PLAIN TO ME,
ACTUALLY.
RICK'S GOT THE BEST SHOT TO WIN
THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.
EVERYBODY LIKES RICK.
SO IF YOU LET HIM SURVIVE
ANOTHER DAY IN THE GAME, HE
COULD WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING HOW THE
GAME TWISTS AND TURNS.
I WAS LEANING TOWARDS ALBERT
GOING NEXT, BUT NOW I'M THINKING
OF THE FINAL THREE PUTTING RICK
IN THERE, GOOD OLD BOY,
EVERYBODY LOVES THE STORIES.
HE HASN'T PISSED ANYBODY OFF.
HE'S BEEN A HARD WORKER WHO JUST
SAYS AWUSHUCKS.
I SAY VOTE RICK TONIGHT.
DO YOU AGREE?
THAT WILL BE THE BEST CHANCE
WE HAVE.
WE HAVE.
THAT MEANS SOMEONE ELSE HAS
TO GO.
ALBERT, PICK UP MY PIECES!
I MEAN, COME ON.
REALISTICALLY, SOPHIE IS A
PRETTY BIG THREAT.
SHE'S WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITIES
AND I THINK IN FRONT OF THE JURY
SHE'LL SPEAK WELL.
SHE MIGHT BE A LOT TOUGHER TO
BEAT THAN RICK.
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A
DECISION TO MAKE, AND I HAVE A
LOT OF FACTORS TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.
AND THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD
ARGUMENT FOR BOTH SIDES.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
VOTE SOMEBODY ELSE'S WAY,
PROBABLY.
PROBABLY.
HE JUST KEPT TRYING TO WALK
OFF.
COACH IS PRETTY GOD AT SKIRT THE
TRUTH.
YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS
WORDS.
HE'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING BUT HE
WON'T COME OUT AND COMMIT TO
ANYTHING.
I'M THINKING SOPHIE.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
TRUST MOO, MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ON YOUR
VOTE, THOUGH?
I'D VOTE FOR SOPHIE.
WOULD YOU VOTE FOR ME?
NO.

I KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
RICK'S KIND OF A PRETTY BIG
THREAT.
HE REALLY DIDN'T PISS ANYBODY
OFF--
LISTEN, MAN, I THINK NOW IS
THE TIME TO GET RID OF SOPHIE,
SEND A MESSAGE THAT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE OTHER THING.
COACH TOLD ME HE WANTS TO TAKE
ME TO THE UNDERSTAND.
HE GAVE ME HIS WORD AS A
CHRISTIAN MAN.
SO IF YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR RICK,
I THINK THAT IT'S FOOLISH
BECAUSE COACH IS GOING TO GET
RID OF YOU NEXT.
IF YOU JUST FOLLOW COACH'S
TRADITIONAL PLAY BOOK,
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WOULD TELL
YOU HE'D BE INTERESTED IN MAYBE
BRINGING OZZY TO THE END.
YOU KNOW, HE ALWAYS WANTED TO
SAY I WANT TO SURROUND MYSELF
WITH THE STRONGEST PLAYER AND
IT'S UNDENIABLE OZZY HAS PLAYED
THE STRONGEST GAME.
THEY'RE DOING LAST MINUTE
STUFF.
HE'S SAYING YOU GAVE HIM HIS
WORD AS A CHRISTIAN MAN YOU'LL
TAKE HIM TO THE END.
DIDN'T HAPPEN, OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE HIS
ASS OUT OF HERE.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, DID
YOU TELL HIM IT WAS GONNA BE YOU
AND HIM?
I DON'T THINK I'LL GET VOTED OUT
TONIGHT BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT
MY ENDING, AND IF COACH IS
THINKING HE MIGHT WANT TO GO TO
THE END WITH SOPHIE AND OZZY, I
MIGHT HAVE TO BE INCLINED TO
LISTEN TO WHAT OZZY HAS TO SAY
AND GET RID OF SOPHIE.
AND GET RID OF SOPHIE.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
JIM.
KEITH.
DAWN.
WHITNEY.
COCHRAN.
EDNA.
AND BRANDON.
SO, OZZY, LET'S START WITH
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO WIN OR YOU
WERE GONE TONIGHT.
OH, YEAH.
OF COURSE.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
I KNEW THAT IF I DIDN'T WIN, I
WOULD BE GOING HOME TONIGHT,
BOTTOM LINE.
Jeff: COACH, AT THE LAST
TRIBAL YOU WERE VERY CLEAR IN
SAYING I HAVE THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
TONIGHT IS THE LAST NIGHT YOU
CAN PLAY THAT IDOL.
IT'S NOT SO HIDDEN ANY MORE.
YES, I'M WEARING IT AROUND MY
NECK.
I'D BE FOOLISH NOT TO PLAY IT TO
GET INTO THE FINAL FOUR.
Jeff: SO YOU'RE REALLY SAFE
TONIGHT AS WELL.
SO IT COMES DOWN TO RICK,
SOPHIE, AND ALBERT.
SO, ALBERT, WHAT'S YOUR
ARGUMENT?
WHY KEEP YOU TONIGHT?
I THINK THE MOST REASONABLE
ARGUMENT IS I'M KIND OF SOMEBODY
VALUABLE TO KEEP AROUND TO BE
ABLE TO COMPETE WITH OZZY AND
SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M READY TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH
YOU."
Jeff: SOPHIE IF THIS IS ALL
ABOUT GETTING RID OF OZZY, WHY
KEEP YOU?
ARE YOU A THREAT TO BEAT OZZY?
YEAH, I THINK I AM.
I'VE WON MORE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES THAN RICK, ALBERT,
AND COACH.
Jeff: RICK, WHAT'S YOUR
PITCH AS TO WHY YOU SHOULD STICK
AROUND TONIGHT?
WELL, 90% TOMORROW, OZZY'S
GOING TO WIN IMMUNITY, MORE THAN
LIKELY.
SO HE'S GOT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE
THAT AREN'T GOING TO BEAT HIM,
AND I HATE TO SAY THAT ABOUT
MYSELF BUT I HAVEN'T WON ANY
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.
SO THAT'S ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT.
Jeff: SOPHIE, HOW DO YOU
COUNTER RICK'S ARGUMENT THAT HE
MAKES TO OZZY WHICH IS, VOTE
WITH ME BECAUSE YOU WILL BEAT
ME?
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
STEP RIGHT NOW IS TO GET RID OF
OZZY, AND IF RICK'S NOT THE MAN
TO DO IT, THERE'S NO POINT IN
HAVING HIM AROUND NEXT TIME.
Jeff: COACH, WHY IS IT YOU
DON'T WANT OZZY TO MOVE ON AND
NOT SOMEONE ELSE OUT OF THIS
GROUP?
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT COMES
BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING WHERE
WE MADE A BOND WITH EACH OTHER.
AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE MERGE,
YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS AND TRY
TO FEEL OUT WHAT THE BEST
DIRECTION FOR THE GAME IS.
AND GUESS WHAT?
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE
STILL A FAMILY.
AND I STILL THINK THIS IS
FAMILY.
AND TAKE THAT VERY SPECIAL.
WELL, WE TALKED.
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO-- IF YOU
WANT TO AIR IT OUT, COACH.
YOU SAID-- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO TAKE ME TO THE END.
RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY, MAN.
AIR IT OUT.
I DON'T CARE.
LOOK, YOU SAID WE HAVE A GOOD
SHOT AT MAKING A GO AT THE END
OF THIS GAME.
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS NOW WHO IS A LOYAL
PERSON, WHO IS NOT.
BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S NOT JUST OLD
LOYALTIES THAT MAKES MEANTIME
OZZY OUT OF THE GAME.
OZZY HASN'T RESPECTED ME SINCE
DAY ONE.
THAT'S BULL.
WHEN YOU DON'T TALK MORE THAN
ONE SENTENCE TO ME, THAT'S
DISRESPECTFUL.
I THINK YOU ACT LIKE A
SPOILED BRAT.
HOW?
EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION
I'M MAKE MY JUDGMENT OFF OF IS
FROM PEOPLE WHO COME THROUGH
REDEMPTION AND PEOPLE SAY ALL
SOPHIE DOES IS SLEEP AND NOTHING
ELSE.
ALL SHE DOES IT HANG OUT.
JUST BEING HONEST.
JUST TO MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR, I
DID LIKE YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF
THIS GAME, AND THEN YOU HEAR
OZZY IS SUCH AN ARROGANT
( BLEEP ).
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO SAY
THAT.
FINE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
IT'S THE SAME THING.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
WHATEVER.
Jeff: SOPHIE, I'M UNCLEAR
ON WHY YOU'RE FRUSTRATED THAT
OZZY IS SAYING SOMETHING BEHIND
YOUR BACK ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER
WHEN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DID THE
SAME THING AS WELL.
I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS A
VERY, LIKE, PERSONAL ATTACK JUST
FROM OZZY.
AND SO TO HEAR THAT I'VE BEEN
SINGLED OUT AS THIS BRAT, IT WAS
HURTFUL.
IT WAS REALLY HURTFUL.
Jeff: ARE THERE OTHER TIMES
IN LIFE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN SITUATION WHERE'S PEOPLE ARE
COMMENTING ON YOUR CHARACTER OR
IS THIS UNIQUE?
NO, THIS IS UNIQUE.
Jeff: SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS
SO PERSONAL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
USED TO IT AND YOU'RE FEELING
LIKE IT IS AN ATTACK ON CUR
CHARACTER FROM SOMEBODY WHO
DOESN'T KNOW YOU.
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A GAME AND
YOU HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC AND YOU
HAVE TO LIE, THERE ARE WAYS TO
KEEP YOUR CHARACTER INTACT.
AND I FELT LIKE I'VE DONE THAT
THIS WHOLE GAME, AND I FELT LIKE
I HAVEN'T MADE PERSONAL ATTACKS
AGAINST PEOPLE.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING UNNECESSARY
TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND I
FELT LIKE I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
SO WHEN SUDDENLY AFTER FEELING
LIKE I'VE KEPT MY CHARACTER
INTACT WHEN IT IS SUDDENLY
CALLED INTO QUESTION, AND EVEN
NOW WHEN HE'S SAYING IT'S
EVERYBODY CALLING INTO QUESTION,
IT DOES HURT.
Jeff: DO YOU SEE THIS AS
ANY KIND OF AN OPPORTUNITY
SHOULD YOU SURVIVE TONIGHT'S
VOTE OF THICKENING THE SKIN?
I MEAN, I WOULD SAY THEY
LEARNED MORE ABOUT MY WEAKNESSES
THAN MY STRENGTHS.
I THINK I THOUGHT WHEN I CAME
OUT HERE THAT I HAD MUCH TOUGHER
KIN.
SO I DON'T THINK I'M BUILDING
SKIN OUT HERE.
I THINK I'M LOSING IT.
Jeff: YOU KNOW PART OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS 37
DAYS.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jeff: IN A GAME THAT CAN BE
BRUTAL ON YOUR PSYCHE.
PEOPLE TELL YOU WHAT THEY THINK
ABOUT YOU QUITE OFTEN.
AND THEY MAY MEAN IT.
THEY MAY NOT.
THEY MAY JUST KNOW THEY CAN GET
UNDER YOUR SKIN.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW OZZY
SAID THAT IT DIDN'T JUST COME
FROM HIM.
AND NOW I'M JUST WORRIED THAT IF
IT DIDN'T JUST DRAMATIC HIM,
THAT I'M THIS BIG, AWFUL,
SELFISH, SPOILED BITCH, AND IT
MAKES ME REGRET COMING.
Jeff: SOPHIE, YOU'RE STILL
IN THIS GAME.
YEAH.
Jeff: THAT ARE GETTING
READY TO VOTE.
AND THE MORE YOU SHOW THIS, THE
BIGGER REASON YOU GIVE TO GET
RID OF YOU.
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE LAST
CHANCE IF YOU WANT TO SIT BACK
UP AND SAY, "DON'T READ TOO MUCH
INTO THIS."
OR YOU TELL ME TO GO VOTE AND
WE'LL VOTE RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, LET'S VOTE.
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS A
VERY BIG VOTE, OBVIOUSLY, AND
VERY DIFFERENT TONIGHT.
REDEMPTION ISLAND'S GONE.
YOU'RE VOTED OUT TONIGHT, THAT'S
IT.
YOU JOIN THE JURY.
OZZY HAS THE NECKLACE, COACH IS
THREATENING TO USE THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL SO IT WOULD APPEAR
YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR RICK,
SOPHIE, AND ALBERT.
RICK, YOU'RE UP.
SOPHIE, YOU'RE THE ONLY SHOT
I'VE GOT.
DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU CRY,
BUT I STILL THINK IT.
BUT I STILL THINK IT.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SOOPINION.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, RICK.
SOPHIE.
ONE VOTE RICK, ONE VOTE SOPHIE.
RICK.
TWO VOTES RICK, ONE VOTE SOPHIE.
SOPHIE.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES RICK, TWO
VOTES SOPHIE.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
16th PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC," RICK.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
HAVE A SEAT.
HAVE A SEAT, MAN.
GO HAVE A SEAT.
Jeff: RICK.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
TOMORROW, YOU WILL COMPETE IN
YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
THE STAKES ARE CLEAR-- WIN AND
YOU EARN YOURSELF A SPOT AT THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
LOSE, CLEARLY, YOU ARE
VULNERABLE.
TRY TO GETTA I GOOD NIGHT'S
SLEEP.
YOU WILL NEED IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
ALL THE HONESTY, INTEGRITY,
ALL THAT STUFF, AND COACH STOOD
UP, "OH, DON'T BE THAT WAY."
IT'S LIKE, "SIT DOWN.
DON'T BREATHE DOWN MY BACK AND
TELL ME IT'S RAINING.
I WISH I HAD MADE A BIGGER MOVE
BUT I WAS BLINDED THINKING COACH
WAS PLAYING TRUE TO HIS WORD.
OZZY'S GOT MY VOTE.
I MADE IT TO THE FINAL FOUR.
I'M SO CLOSE TO FINISHING THIS
GAME, AND I WANT THIS SO BAD.
I CAN JUST SENSE VICTORY.
AND I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO
QUIT.
I DO HAVE A PLAN B.
PLAN B. IS TO WIN.
PLAN A., WIN.
PLAN B., WIN.
I KNOW THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER
THEY CAN TO GET AN EDGE, AN
ADVANTAGE, SO DO I PLAN ON
SHARING THE COCONUTS THAT I TAKE
DOWN?
HELL NO.
NO WAY.
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FUEL MY
BODY AND GET READY FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE.
OKAY, COOL, MAN, LET'S TALK.
BUT NOW IT'S JUST LIKE--
NO, I CAN'T STAND HIM BEING
HERE, IT, LIKE, ACTUALLY,
IRRITATES ME.
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU, MAN.
I'M FEELING BOTHERED.
AT FIRST REALLY MAD.
THEN I WAS JUST REALLY SAD
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE TOLD ME HAS BEEN A
LIE.
IN WHAT WAY?
WELL, I GO TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND, AND I SAID AS A
CHRISTIAN MAN I WANT TO PLAY
THIS GAME WITH YOU.
AND I SPECIFICALLY SAID DON'T
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT I'VE TOLD
YOU HERE.
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND I.
AND LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL, YOU'RE
JUST LIKE, ALL RIGHT, COACH, I'M
GOING TO JUST SAY IT.
AND YOU SPILLED ALL THE BEANS.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF
GAME YOU'RE PLAYING WITH ME.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND I
KNEW THAT I NEEDED TO CLEAR THE
AIR WITH OZZY.
I FELT LIKE I HAD GIVEN HIM
RESPECT.
I FELT LIKE I HAD TOLD HIM THE
TRUTH.
AND IN RECIP CIGS, I HAD GOTTEN
STABBED IN THE BACK.
IT'S VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO ME.
I'M VERY-- I'M VERY SADDENED BY
IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND--
I'VE BEEN BURNED SO BAD IN
THIS GAME BEFORE BY TRUSTING
PEOPLE.
THEN JUST TELL ME THAT'S WHAT
IT IS.
THAT IS TOTALLY, 100% IT.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE PUT ALL MY
CARDS IN ONE BASKET, WHICH WAS
TRUSTING A COUPLE OF PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT.
AND GOT SCREWED BECAUSE OF
IT.
THE WORST PART IS, IS I LET
MYSELF CARE ABOUT THAT PERSON,
AND WHEN I CARED ABOUT THAT
PERSON, AND THEY STABBED ME IN
THE BACK, IT WAS EVEN WORSE.
SO THIS TIME, I'VE BEEN SO
GUARDED, THAT I FELT LIKE I
COULDN'T TRUST YOU YESTERDAY.
RIGHT.
OZZY OPENED UP TO ME AND HE LET
ME KNOW THAT THIS GAME HAD
REALLY HURT HIM BAD-- NOT THE
GAME ITSELF, BUT THE PEOPLE HE
HAD PLAYED WITH.
HE HAD GIVEN HIS IMPLICIT TRUST
IN PEOPLE AND THEY HAD BURNED
HIM AND WHEN I SAW THAT IN OZZY,
MY HEART BROKE FOR HIM.
EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR ME IN
THAT INSTANT.
GETTING OVER THAT, THAT
ISSUE, HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT THINGS.
EVEN THOUGH WHAT I TOLD YOU IS
TRUE, AND I DO WANT TO-- I DO
WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH YOU,
BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S HOW THIS GAME SHOULD BE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR THAT WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO
HOME TONIGHT?
OBVIOUSLY, SOPHIE, RIGHT.
NOT ME.
OBVIOUSLY, SOVIET, RIGHT.
NO, NOW IT'S-- AS WEIRD AS
THIS SOUNDS, I I'D LIKE ALBERT
AND SOPHIE TO MAKE A FIRE.
REALLY?
YEAH.
I WOULD.
THAT'S AWESOME.
A TIE.
I LIKE THAT IDEA ACTUALLY.
NO, ACTUALLY, I REALLY LIKE THIS
IDEA.
I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO BA
BSTRATEGY.
WE'RE TOTALLY FINE.
YEAH, DUDE.
I'VE BEEN THEY GO PLAGUE THIS
GAME TO WIN.
AND I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE
I'M COMING FROM.
I LIKE THAT IDEA ABOUT
TONIGHT.
ALL THIS COULD BE A BIG JOKE
ON ME.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW, BUT IT
DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS
IT, BABY.
DAY 38.
THIS IS THE LAST CHALLENGE THAT
I WILL EVER PLAY IN THIS GAME.
THE FACT IS, THEY TRIED THEIR
HARDEST YESTERDAY.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY THEIR
HARDEST TODAY, BUT SO AM I.
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH, AND
I'M READY.
I WILL LEAVE EVERYTHING I HAVE
IN THAT CHALLENGE BECAUSE THIS
CHALLENGE FOR ME IS WORTH A
MILLION DOLLARS.
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
WELCOME TO YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
OH, MAN.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING 38 DAYS FOR
THIS.
Jeff: LET'S GET TO IT.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, OZZY.
I WILL TAKE IT BACK.
FOR THE LAST TIME, IMMUNITY IS
BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE HERE ON "SURVIVOR:
SOUTH PACIFIC," YOU WILL RACE
THROUGH A GIANT FLOWER-SHAPED
OBSTACLE COURSE TO COLLECT FIVE
BAGS OF PUZZLE PIECES.
YOU'LL THEN USE THOSE PIECES TO

FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT
WINS IMMUNITY, IS GUARANTEED A
SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO
PLEAD YOUR CASE TO THE JURY
ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE THE TITLE
OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION
DOLLAR CHECK.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY'S DREAM OF WINNING IT

HUGE STAKES.
YOU'RE ALL READY FOR IT.
I'M READY TO GO.

OZZY, COACH, OR ALBERT.
ONE OF THEM WILL BECOME THE
NINTH MEMBER OF THE JURY.
THE OTHER TWO WILL JOIN YOU AT
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
GREAT JOB, SOPHIE.
YOU KICKED ASS.
I TRIED THAT ONE SO MANY TIMES
AND I JUST COULDN'T GET IT TO
FIT.
I WAS SURPRISED, ACTUALLY, BY
HOW EASY THE PUZZLE WAS, ONCE
YOU GOT IT GOING.
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS HARD WAS
THE FIRST PIECE.
JUST GOT BACK FROM THE FINAL
CHALLENGE AND I LOST.
OF COURSE STUPID PUZZLE.
MY MIND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND I
COULDN'T DO IT.
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE, I'VE
PUT INTO THIS GAME, JUST CAME
CRASHING DOWN.
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.
I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, COACH TOLD ME HE
WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE END,
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME HE'S
GOING TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT--
WHOO!
HEY!
OH, YEAH!
I RELINQUISH ONCE AND FOR ALL
THE TITLE OF DRAGON SLAYER, AND
YOU ARE THE DRAGON SLAYER.
WHOOO!
A NEW SLAYER IS BORN.
SOPHIE, YOU CERTAINLY ARE
BECAUSE IN THIS GAME, FROM
MOMENT ONE, OZZY WAS THE CRAGON.
AND YOU SLAYED HIM.
EVERYTHING WAS RIDING ON THIS
CHALLENGE.
BEATING OZZY WAS CRUCIAL.
OZZY HAD TO BE OUT OF THIS GAME.
AND I THINK BEYOND THAT, BEING
THE ONE TO BEAT OZZY, MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN HANG MY HAT ON
COME FINAL TRIBAL.
HE'S BEEN THE TANGIBLE
VILLAIN.
HE LITERALLY IS THE BAD GUY.
AND WE GOT TO FREAKING KNOCK HIM
OUT ON THE LAST DAY.
DON'T TALK OZZY FOR TOO LONG.
I DON'T WANT TO BE HAMMING IT UP
WITH HIM AND CAUSE DISSENSION
AMONG US.
YEAH.
SO I'M JUST GOING TO TALK TO
HIM JUST FAIR SECOND.
NOBODY CAN BE AS CONFIDENT AS
I AM RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE THE NECKLACE AROUND MY
NECK, BUT TONIGHT IS NOT A LOCK
FOR ALBERT AND COACH.
THERE COULD BE A 2-2 TIE
TONIGHT.
I THINK ALBERT WILL DEFINITELY
VOTE FOR OZZY.
I'LL DEFINITELY VOTE FOR OZZY.
BUT COACH'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
OZZY HAS BEEN A BIT BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS.
HE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH
HIM AT REDEMPTION, AT THE MERGE,
THIS MORNING.
COACH COULD BE PLAYING A GAME
ALBERT AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT I HAVE
VERY LITTLE SHOT FOR THE MILLION
AGAINST OZZY.
HOW YOU FEELING?
I'M AT PEACE.
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO
REALLY IS THE MOST DESERVING
PERSON, AND I KNOW YOU GOT A
LITTLE FLARE FOR THE DRAMATIC,
THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK IS
JUST TO GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO
FIGHT ONE MORE BATTLE TO MAKE A
FIRE WITH ALBERT.
THIS WOULD BE THE MOST EPIC OF
EPIC WAYS.
I MEAN, LISTEN, COACH.
I KNOW, MAN, I HEAR IT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
BATTLING AGAINST.
WHAT.
I'M BATTLING MY WORD.
YOU ALSO GAVE ME YOUR WORD.
AFTER I YOUR WORD, I FELT
LIKE YOU BETRAYED ME.
YOU FEEL LIKE ALBERT HASN'T
BETRAYED YOU.
I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEND
TWO DAYS WITH YOU.
I THINK IF SOMEBODY HAS SPENT SO
MUCH TIME WITH A PERSON AND THEY
BETRAY YOU THEN, AS OPPOSED TO
SOMEONE THAT YOU'VE JUST MET
THAT HAS NEVER SEEN WHAT YOU
ARE, WHAT YOU STAND FOR.
THE REAL TEST OF WHO IS
DESERVING TO GO AND SIT NEXT TO
YOU IS THIS OPPORTUNITY.
I HAVE SAID FROM THE
BEGINNING OF DAY ONE THAT I WANT
TO TAKE THE BEST TO THE END.
I WANT TO TAKE THE STRONGEST TO
THE END.
I WANT TO TAKE THE WARRIORS TO
THE END.
AND OZZY, IN EVERY SENSE OF THE
WORD, IS A WARRIOR.
ALBEIT ARROGANT, BUT HE IS A
WARRIOR.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS BE
THE REAL WARRIOR BATTLE THAT YOU
SAY YOU WANT TO HAVE, THAT WE
BOTH TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS THE
WAY TO DO IT.
IT REALLY IS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S ALSO A WORD OF A
CHRISTIAN MAN THAT YOU GAVE TO
ME.
THIS IS WHERE IT'S REAL.
RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE THE RIGHT
DECISION, MAN.
THE DILEMMA THAT I HAVE NOW,
WHY ISN'T THERE AN EASY VOTE AT
THIS TIME?
WHY CAN'T I SAY TO MYSELF, COOL,
MAN.
IT'S THE ENEMY THAT WE'VE BEEN
FIGHTING AGAINST ALL ALONG.
IT'S OZZY.
WHY CAN'T IT BE EASY?
BUT IT'S STILL, ON DAY 38, RACKS
MY BRAIN BECAUSE I'M SITTING
HERE WITH ANOTHER ANGUISHING
DECISION.
ANOTHER DECISION THAT'S GOING TO
RIP MY HEART OUT.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
JIM.
KEITH.
DAWN.
WHITNEY.
COCHRAN.
EDNA.
BRANDON.
AND RICK.
Jeff: SO, SOPHIE, AFTER 38
DAYS, TO BE AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL WITH IMMUNITY AROUND
YOUR NECK, HOW'S IT FEEL?
IT FEELS AMAZING.
IT FEELS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
I'VE HAD SO MANY UPS AND DOWNS
IN THIS GAME.
AND IT FEELS NICE THAT I CAN BE
IN THIS GOOD PLACE AT A TIME
WHEN IT REALLY, REALLY MATTERS,
WHICH WAS TODAY.
SO I FELT LIKE I PULLED IT OUT.
Jeff: OZZY.
YO.
Jeff: YOU CAME INTO THIS
CHALLENGE KNOWING I GOTTA WIN OR
I'M IN TROUBLE.
YEAH, IT WAS A MILLION-DOLLAR
PUZZLE.
AND WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO FITTING
THE PUZZLE PIECES IN, THAT FIRST
PIECE THEY KEEP PLAYING OVER
BACK IN MY MIND IS I WAS RIGHT
THERE.
WHY WASN'T IT FITTING IN WHICH I
WHEN I WANTED IT TO?
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON IT
DIDN'T, AND I HAVE TO LET IT GO.
BUT IT'S GOING TO NAG AT ME FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.
Jeff: COACH, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS LIKE.
BOTH YOU GUYS PLAYING FOR YOUR
THIRD TIME.
HARD TO HEAR OZZY SAY I'VE COME
SO CLOSE YET AGAIN I FALL SHORT?
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.
YOU KNOW THAT THERE COMES THAT
TIME WHEN YOU THINK THIS MIGHT
BE MY LAST DAY.
AND IT'S PRETTY DEVASTATING.
AND FROM A COMPETITOR LIKE OZZY
WHO IS SO DESERVING TO BE ANY
PLACE IN THE THIS GAME, THE
FINAL THREE, IT'S HEARTBREAKING
TO SEE THAT AND TO KNOW HOW HE
FEELS.
Jeff: OZZY, HOW DID YOU
SPEND THE AFTERNOON?
WELL, IT'S NO SECRET THAT
COACH AND I TALKED MULTIPLE
TIMES ABOUT SITTING IN THE FINAL
TWO, IN A REAL EPIC BATTLE
BETWEEN THE TWO RETURNING
SURVIVORS.
AND IF COACH IS A MAN OF HIS
WORD, HE'LL LIVE UP TO THAT
PROMISE.
SO I KNOW COACH IS GOING THROUGH
THIS SORT OF MENTAL PROCESS.
BUT I THINK THERE'S A REALLY
EASY WAY TO FIND OUT WHO
DESERVES IT.
COACH KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.
Jeff: WHOSE HE TALKING
ABOUT COACH?
TALKING ABOUT TYING UP THE
VOTE SO THERE'S A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE.
Jeff: JUST SO I'M CLEAR,
OZZY IS SAYING GIVE ME A SHOT.
LET ME GO UP AGAINST ALBERT.
WHOEVER CAN MAKE FIRE MOVES ON.
RIGHT.
Jeff: IS THAT HARD FOR YOU
BECAUSE THE ONE CONSISTENT IN
ALL THREE TIMES THAT YOU'VE
PLAYED HAS BEEN I ACTUALLY WANT
TO TRY TO PLAY A GAME WITH
HONOR.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS GAME
IS VERY HARD, ESPECIALLY IF YOU
START OUT THIS GAME AND YOU SAY
I WANT TO PLAY IT HONORABLY.
AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID, YOU KNOW,
THAT I WANT TO TAKE THE
STRONGEST PEOPLE TO THE END.
BUT I THINK THAT THESE TWO HERE
ARE ALSO VERY STRONG.
THE ONLY THING THAT SETS OZZY
APART IS THAT HE CAME BACK AND
COMING BACK IS AN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO GET TO THE
END.
AND SO THAT'S THE DILEMMA.
Jeff: ALBERT HOW DO YOU
THINK YOU WOULD DO IN A FIRE
MAKING CHALLENGE AGAINST OZZY
JAI KNOW HOW TO MAKE FIRE.
BUT IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW
HOW TO DRIVE.
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO BEAT JEFF
GORDON IN AN AUTO RACE?
I CAN'T SAY I FAVOR VERY WELL,
SPEAKING VERY CANDIDLY WITH IT.
Jeff: HEARING OZZY BROACH
THIS TOPIC WITH COACH HAS GOT TO
BE A LITTLE UNSETTLING.
IT'S SOMETHING THEY JUST HAVE
TO KEEP MY TRUST IN COACH THAT
HE IS THE PERSON THAT I'VE SEEN
HIM BE TO ME.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT
HE'S DONE THAT WOULD INDICATE HE
MIGHT TURN HIS BACK ON ME AT
THIS POINT BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SOPHIE HAS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, YOU CANNOT
VOTE FOR SOPHIE.
ANYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ALBERT, YOU'RE UP.
PRIDE COMES BEFORE THE FALL,
MY MAN.
HOPE YOU LEARNED A LESSON IN
HUMILITY.
BECAUSE I AM THE NEW DRAGON
SLAYER.
SLAYER.
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IT FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE.
OZZY.
ALBERT.
OZZY.
TWO VOTES OZZY, ONE VOTE ALBERT.
17th PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC" AND
THE NINTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF
OUR JURY, OZZY.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
SAYONARA, "SURVIVOR."
MAN, I HAD A GOOD RIDE.
( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM, BABY.
Jeff: OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
IT WAS GREAT.
THANKS A LOT FOR THE CHANCE.
YEE-HAAA!
Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN
GO IN THIS GAME.
TOMORROW NIGHT, YOU WILL RETURN
HERE FOR YOUR FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL AND YOU WILL GET YOUR
CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE TO THE
JURY ABOUT WHY YOU ARE THE MOST
DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION DOLLAR
CHECK.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
THREE TIMES IN "SURVIVOR"
GETTING YOUR TORCH SNUFFED OUT
IS SURREAL.
BUT THE JURY CLAPPED FOR ME.
THAT WAS SUCH AN AWESOME
FEELING.
I PLAYED AS GOOD A SOCIAL GAME
AS I COULD HAVE WITH A FEW
MISTAKES HERE AND THERE WHICH I
THINK LED ME TO REDEMPTION.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I TRULY CANNOT BELIEVE IT,
GUYS.
FINAL THREE!
AN OZZY-FREE CAMP.
BIG, BIG HUG.
AH!
TRIBAL TONIGHT, THERE WAS A
DILEMMA IN MY MIND.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I
MEAN, IT REALLY WAS A
NO-BRAINER.
SO OZZY WENT HOME TONIGHT.
WE CAME BACK AS A FAMILY.
AND FOR US TO BE HERE AT DAY 38,
I FORGOT WHO SAID IT, MARK
TWAIN, SHAKESPEARE, ONE OF THOSE
GUYS SAID, IF I'M IN A CREAM
RIGHT NOW, LET ME NEVER WAKE UP.
I'M SO HAPPY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YEAH.
I'M JUST ON CLOUD NINE.
I'M TOTALLY ELATED.
IT'S TRULY AMAZING, AND I'M
TRULY AND UTTERLY BLESSED.
IT FEELS GOOD.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
GOOD NIGHT.
MIGHT AS WELL GET ON WITH OUR
DAY, RIGHT?
SHOW ME THE MONEY!
HEY!
FINAL THREE BREAKFAST!
TWO BASKETS.
CHAMPAGNE.
HOW MANY EGGS WE GOT?
OH, YEAH!
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WE WOKE UP AND WE GO TO TREE
MAIL, AND THERE'S JUST MORE FOOD
THAN I'VE EATEN THIS WHOLE
ENTIRE TIME AND I COULDN'T HELP
MYSELF.
I WAS HOPPING UP AND DOWN LIKE A
BUNNY.
HERE'S TO DAY 39.
WHOO!
YEAH!
I'M NOT A SAUSAGE PERSON.
THESE ARE AWESOME.
AFTER 39 DAYS OF DEPRIVATION,
HAVING THIS ONE DAY WHERE WE
SUDDENLY GET EVERYTHING, IT'S
AMAZING.
I THINK WE'RE ALL REALLY PROUD
OF OURSELVES TODAY.
I THINK WE REALLY ARE, REALIZING
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DID IT.
NOBODY CAN VOTE US OUT.
COME HERE, COME HERE, GUYS.
I NEED A HUG.
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I'M
GLAD THAT IT'S THE THREE OF US,
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD
BE YOU OR I, I REALLY DO.
ALBERT REALLY GOT LUCKY.
I THINK THAT HE PLAYED A SPOILER
GAME.
HE WAS REALLY OUT FOR HIMSELF
AND PANDERING TO THE JURY WAY
TOO QUICKLY.
AND HE'S LUCKY TO BE HERE.
I TALKED TO COACH A BIT ABOUT
LOW TO HANDLE ALBERT.
I'D LIKE ALBERT TO LIVE UP IN
TRIBAL COUNCIL TO BEING A BIT
SQUIRRELLY, A BILL BIT WORMER.
I TRULY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
BAD TO SAY ABOUT YOU AND I'M NOT
GOING TO.
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY FOR ME TO
SAY ABOUT YOU.
I THOUGHT TODAY UNDER AND
MORE ABOUT MY EMOTIONAL
BREAKDOWN AT TRIBAL.
I WANT TO KEEP MY COMPOSURE
TONIGHT.
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS
SEEM LIKE THIS COMPLETE, YOU
KNOW, NUT JOB, YOU KNOW, CRAZY,
EMOTIONAL CRYING BECAUSE I THINK
THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T
DESERVE TO GO TO THE END.
SO I'M GOING TO TRY IT GO IN
PERHAPS A BIT MORE LOGICALLY
THAN EMOTIONALLY.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHAMP?
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO TELL ME SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
COACH?
I DON'T WANT TO THROW ANYBODY
UNDER THE BUS BUT IF IT SEEMS
LIKE COACH IS SUDDENLY THE KING
OF ALL KINGS AT TRIBAL, MIGHT AS
WELL GIVE IT A SHOT.
GOING TO TRIBAL TONIGHT I
FEEL CONFIDENT BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I PLAYED A HEAD AND
SHOULDERS BETTER GAME THAN THE
OTHER TWO.
NOT ONLY DO I KNOW HOW TO
EXPRESS MYSELF WELL AND I KNOW
HOW TO PERSUADE WELL BUT I TRULY
THINK I PLAYED THE BEST GAME OF
THE THREE REMAINING.
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL
CONFIDENT ABOUT MY ANSWERS, FEEL
POISED AND NOT FEEL DEFENSIVE OR
ON MY HEELS BUT FEEL KIND OF
STRONGER AND A LITTLE BIT
SHAPER.
I STARTED THIS JOURNEY THREE
YEARS AGO.
I WANTED TO CHANGE THE GAME.
AND I NICKNAMED MYSELF THE
DRAGON SLAYER.
I GOT VOTED OFF.
I KIND OF FELT LIKE A FOOL.
SO I CAME BACK ON "HEROES AND
VILLAINS."
AND I FELT LIKE I BECAME THE
DRAGON BECAUSE I MADE WAY TOO
EARLY OF AN EXIT.
BUT NOW IS THE THIRD AND FINAL
CHAPTER OF MY JOURNEY ON
"SURVIVOR."
THE ANALOGY YOU, YOU LOOK BACK
TO THE ANCIENT CHINESE, THE
STORY GOES THAT THE DRAGON CAME
INTO THE FIRE AND THROUGH THAT
FIRE RESURRECTING FROM THE ASHES
CAME THIS BEAUTIFUL PHOENIX, AND
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS ME.
I SEE MYSELF GOING FROM
DESTRUCTION TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.
BURN IT DOWN, BABY!
LET'S DO IT.
THERE IT IS.
I SEE MYSELF RISING ABOVE
EVERYBODY, RISING ABOVE ALL THE
MISERY THAT I HAVE HAD TO GO
THROUGH, AND I WANT TO SEE THIS
FINAL CHAPTER HAVE A HAPPY
ENDING.
I WANT ON THAT LAST DAY STANDING
TO HAVE TRULY RISEN FROM THE
ASHES AND BECOME THE ULTIMATE
VICTOR IN THIS GAME.
VICTOR IN THIS GAME.
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
JIM.
KEITH.
DAWN.
WHITNEY.
COCHRAN.
EDNA.
BRANDON.
RICK.
AND OZZY.
SO, ALBERT, COACH.
SOPHIE, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN
GO IN THE GAME, AND TONIGHT, THE
POWER IN THE GAME SHIFTS FROM
YOU TO THE JURY.
NINE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND
IN VOTING OUT NOW HOLD YOUR FATE
IN THEIR HANDS.
THEY WILL SKIED WHO IS DESERVING
OF THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR
AND THE MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.
YOU'RE EACH GOING TO GET A
CHANCE TO MAKE THE OPENING
STATEMENT.
THEN THE JURY WILL GET THEIR
FIRST CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU, AND
THEN WE WILL VOTE.
ALBERT, YOU'RE UP.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
KIND OF A BIG EVENING TONIGHT SO
I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW HONORED I
AM, HOW PRIVILEGED, AND HOW
REALLY HUMBLED I AM TO BE IN
THIS POSITION.
TO ME, GUYS, THE BEAUTY OF
"SURVIVOR," WHAT I LOVE WITH
THIS ADVENTURE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE GAME IN ITS TRUEST ESSENCE,
THIS IS A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT, AND
THAT'S THE PART THEY REALLY LOVE
AND APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS GAME.
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS
SURROUNDED WITH, THE PEOPLE I
GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET, TOW
ME THIS IS NOT A GAME ABOUT
CHESS PIECES.
IT'S A GAME ABOUT PEOPLE.
AND I THINK A HIGHER POWER
REALLY BROUGHT EVERYONE SITTING
HERE TONIGHT TOGETHER.
SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU GUYS
FOR PLAYING AND BEING A PART OF
THIS JOURNEY, AND I DON'T THINK
ANY OF US WILL EVER FORGET.
I KNOW THAT I CERTAINLY WILL
NOT.
I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ALL
OF YOUR GUYS QUESTIONS TONIGHT
AND I'M SO THANKFUL JUST FOR
THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.
Jeff: SOPHIE, YOU'RE UP.
OKAY, SO I'M JUST GOING TO
CUT TO THE CHASE.
IT'S ABOUT OUTWIT, OUTLASTING,
AND OUTPLAYING.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUTPLAYING
I FELT LIKE I HELD MY OWN IN THE
CHALLENGES.
WHEN IT CAME TO INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITIES, I WON THREE
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITYS.
WHEN IT CAME TO OUTWITTING, I
FELT THERE WERE TWO PARTS.
ONE WAS THE STRATEGIC PART AND I
FELT I DID THAT WELL.
I MADE A FIVE-PERSON ALLIANCE
FROM THE BEGINNING AND I WANTED
TO KEEP THAT FIVE-PERSON
ALLIANCE TO THE END.
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE
EASIEST THING TO DO, BUT I MADE
SURE THAT MY STRATEGY REVOLVED
AROUND IT.
AND THEN THE OTHER HALF OF THAT
OUTWITTING I THINK WAS A SOCIAL
GAME, AND I THINK IT BECAME MORE
CLEAR TO ME A COUPLE OF TRIBALS
AGO MAYBE I WASN'T SO GOOD AT
THE SOCIAL GAME.
I FELT LIKE I MADE SOME GENUINE
FRIENDSHIPS BACK AT UPOLU.
I'M NOT A USED CAR SALESMAN.
I CAME OUT HERE AND I WAS
MYSELF.
I DO THINK I WAS AS HONEST AS
POSSIBLE.
SO I THINK I FULFILLED THE
REQUIREMENTS.
Jeff: COACH.
I JUST HAVE TO SAY, WOW.
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE I'M UP
HERE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING
OF THIS GAME, REDEMPTION ISLAND
IS BUILT FOR SOMEBODY LIKE OZZY,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S GREAT IN
CHALLENGES, AND, YOU KNOW, COACH
IS A BIT OF A CHARACTER.
I HAD AN UPHILL BATTLE COMING
INTO THIS GAME, AND THE FIRST
TIME I PLAYED THIS GAME I PLAYED
WITH ARROGANCE AND
SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND I TRIED
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS
GAME AND THAT IS I TRIED TO LEAD
WITH COMPASSION, LOVE,
APPRECIATION AND RESPECT.
AND I DON'T THINK A LOT OF
LEADERS DO THAT.
BEST THING ABOUT THIS JOURNEY IS
INSTEAD OF FITTING EVERYBODY TO
MY JOURNEY AND MY PLANS, I JUST
LOOKED AT EVERYBODY THAT WAS
AROUND ME.
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
WHEN YOU OPEN UP YOURSELF TO
OTHERS, YOU RECEIVE IT 10FOLD
AND I'M TRULY BLESSED TO HAVE
GOTTEN A PIECE OF EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU THROUGH THIS GAME.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY, IN A
MOMENT YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR
FIRST CHANCE TO ADDRESS ALBERT,
COACH, AND SOPHIE
I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ALBERT,
COACH, SOPHIE.
YOU'VE MADE YOUR OPENING
STATEMENTS.
THE JURY NOW GET THEIR FIRST
SHOT AT ADDRESSING YOU.
OZZY.
GET US STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY FOR THIS?
I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS,
GUYS.
GOOD NEWS IS, THIS GAME'S NOT
DECIDED.
THE BAD NEWS IS, NOBODY WANTS TO
VOTE FOR ANY OF YOU GUYS.
SOPHIE, I STILL THINK AS A
PRIVILEGED, PRETENTIOUS BRAT.
I STILL DO, IN MY OPINION.
LUCKILY, SOPHIE, YOU CAN CHANGE.
AND ALBERT, YOU'RE JUST THE
PERSON WHO HAPPENED TO BE AT THE
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME
AND REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TOO AMAZING IN MY OPINION.
SO, COACH, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
CREDIT AS A VETERAN GETTING TO
THE END.
IT'S HUGE, AND I'M GIVING YOU
THE CHANCE ALONE TO WIN THIS
GAME OR TO LOSE THIS GAME.
BUT THAT'S BASED ON WHAT YOU
GIVE ME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU
GOT TO BE HONEST.
YOUR GAME PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN A
CERTAIN THING.
THE HONOR, ALL OF THAT.
WE ALL KNOW IT'S A BUNCH OF
BULL, BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT, IT WOULD BE ME AND
YOU SITTING UP THERE.
IT WOULD BE.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO DID YOU PLAY THE WAY YOU
SAY OR DID YOU NOT?
I TRIED TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITH HONOR.
AND I CAME TO ALL THESE
CROSSROADS IN THE GAME WHERE I
HAD TO COMPROMISE MY WORD, AND I
FOUND MYSELF BREAKING MY WORD.
AND IT HURT ME.
I KNEW THAT IT HURT OTHER
PEOPLE.
I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF LIKE
YOU, THIS IS MY THIRD AND FINAL
TIME.
AND I WANT TO GET TO THE END.
AND I WANT TO WIN THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
SO I THINK I PLAYED THIS GAME
MOST OF THE TIME HONORABLY BUT
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS
DEFINITELY DISHONORABLE.
THAT'S IT.
I GUESS I'M GOING TO UNLEASH THE
DOGS ON YOU GUYS NOW.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: JIM, YOU'RE UP.
ALBERT, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHY THE TWO PEOPLE NEXT TO YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE OR SHOULDN'T
WIN THE MILLION DOLLARS, AND
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU START WITH A
COMPLIMENT, LIKE, "COACH IS A
NICE GUY, BUT..." THAT WOULD
LOSE MY VOTE.
ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE THIS QUESTION.
I LOVE THE WAY YOU'RE
APPROACHING THE GAME.
SPECIFICALLY--
( LAUGHTER ).
NO BECAUSE VERY HONESTLY--
VERY HONESTLY, MAN, THE REASON
WHY I DON'T THINK COACH SHOULD
WIN THE GAME IS I REALLY BELIEVE
THE SAVAII TRIBE VIEWED COACH AS
THE LEADER.
THE REALITY, COACH DIDN'T BRING
ME OR SOPHIE HERE.
HE DIDN'T.
WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT HIM HERE.
I TOOK A STAND FOR COACH EARLY
IN THIS GAME AND I GOT HIM
DEEPER IN THE GAME.
COACH HAD A TARGET ON HIS BACK
AND HE WAS CARRIED TO THIS
POINT.
HE DID NOT DO THE CARRYING.
IN TERMS OF SOPHIE, SHE PLAYED A
STRONG GAME BUT DID NOT PLAY A
SOCIAL GAME.
I MADE TRUER CONNECTIONS WITH
THIS GROUP HERE THAN SOPHIE DID
OR THAN COACH DID.
I'M GOOD, THANKS, GUYS.
Jeff: THANKS, JIM.
DAWN.
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUYS.
MY QUESTION IS REALLY JUST FOR
YOU, SOPHIE.
I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR
STRATEGY AND WHY YOU MADE THE
ALLIANCE WITH COACH AND ALBERT.
WHAT ABOUT THEM SPECIFICALLY
EARLY ON?
BEFORE I CAME TO THIS GAME I
SAID I WISH I WAS A MAN BECAUSE
MEN IN THIS GAME SEEM TO BE ABLE
TO GET TWO YOUNG GIRLS TO FOLLOW
THEM TO THE END AND THAT'S
SOMETHING I CAN'T DO.
AND WHEN I MET COACH I SAW HIM
AS THE EQUIVALENT OF A YOUNG
GIRL.
HE WAS SOMEONE WHO SAID TO ME,
"MY LOYALTY IS WORTH MORE THAN A
MILLION DOLLARS.
I WANT TO COME OUT OF THIS GAME
RESTORING WHO I AM."
THAT'S A GUY WHO IS NOT GOING TO
WRITE MY NAME DOWN.
WITH ALBERT, HE WAS REALLY INTO
STRATEGY AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF
ALINING WITH SOMEONE I COULD
REALLY TALK STRATEGY WITH THE
WHOLE GAME.
AS THE GAME WENT ON, OUR
RELATIONSHIP DISINTEGRATED TO
THE POINT WHERE I WAS GOING TO
VOTE HIM OUT FOR SURE AND COACH
AND I BECAME MORE ON THE SAME
PAGE.
AND THEN I SAY THE REASON HE'S
HERE AT THE END IS BECAUSE I
FEEL LIKE KEEPING HIM IN THE
GAME WOULD GIVE ME A BETTER SHOT
AT STAYING IN THE GAME THAN
KEEPING IN RICK.
GREAT.
Jeff: THANKS, DAWN.
RICK.
HERE WE GO.
COACH, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID YOU
TRIED TO PLAY WITH HONOR AND
DIGNITY, AND YOU WOULD LOOK ME
IN THE EYE AND SAY, "WE'RE MEN
OF HONOR."
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO
ME AT ALL?
YES.
LET'S HEAR IT, SHORT.
I APOLOGIZE.
YOU JUST STUCK ME RIGHT IN
THE BACK.
ALBERT, THE NIGHT THAT YOU TOOK
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE FROM
BRANDON AND YOU USED THE GOD
THING ON HIM, THAT WAS A BUNCH
OF BULL.
SOPHIE--
CAN I COMMENT ON THAT, RICK?
NO.
I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT?
NO.
SOPHIE, YOU LIED THE WHOLE WAY.
WHY SHOULD YOU WIN THE MONEY?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME WORTH?
IS YOUR NAME WORTH SUPPLYING
CHEATING THE WAY THROUGH IT?
NO, MY NAME IS WORTH A LOT.
AND I DID TRY AS MUCH AS I COULD
IN THIS GAME TO ONLY LIE WHEN I
FELT LIKE IT WAS JUSTIFIED TO
GET TO THE END.
AND I WILL SAY, AND I'M SAYING
THIS HONESTLY, THE ONE PERSON I
FEEL THE MOST BAD ABOUT THE LIE
WAS YOU.
A LIE IS A LIE.
I THINK THAT'S THE THING-- I
THINK THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE
ONLY THINGS I'M ASHAMED OF OUT
OF THIS GAME.
YOU GUYS LIVED WITH ME FOR 37
DAYS.
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT LIARS.
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY TO
THOSE GUYS.
Jeff: THANKS, RICK.
BRANDON, YOU'RE UP.
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
UHM, MR. COACH, AT THE BEGINNING
OF THIS GAME, YOU SAID THAT AS A
MAN OF GOD, THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER, NO MATTER WHAT, VOTE ME
OUT OF THIS GAME.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU GOT TO SAY
TO ME?
YEAH, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR RAISING THE BAR.
YOU RAISED ALL OF OUR STANDARDS
HIGHER AND YOU PREACHED THE NAME
OF JESUS CHRIST AND IT WAS A
RALLY CRY FOR US AND IT WAS AN
HONOR TO PLAY WITH YOU.
AND WITH YOU, YOU KNOW, I
HONESTLY THINK YOU SHOULD BE
HERE.
AND I SAW YOU BEING HERE.
YOU WERE NOT MEANT TO BE HOME,
BROTHER.
I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL HURT, AND I
WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
A LITTLE BIT HURT.
BUT I DO FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT
YOU'VE DONE.
ALBERT, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
USING GOD TO GET TO THE FINAL
THREE?
I'VE NEVER ONCE USED GOD IN
THIS GAME.
I KNEW THAT I'D BE WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING TO WIN THIS GAME,
ANYTHING.
THE ONE THING I WOULD NEVER
COMPROMISE IS MY PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.
AND I KNOW THAT THIS GAME
SERIOUSLY BROUGHT ME CLOSER,
BACK TO MY WALK WITH MY GOD.
I THANK YOU FOR THAT, MAN.
--
I'M-- CAN I?
GO AHEAD, MAN.
I APPRECIATE IT.
AND HONESTLY FEEL THAT YOU'RE
BEING GENUINE WITH ME.
JUST REALLY QUICK QUESTION.
DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING HOME?
LET ME TELL YOU--
DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING
HOME.
I'M GOING TO TELL--
DID YOU KNOWIS GOING HOME.
YES OR NO.
THIS IS THE ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION.
YES OR NO.
I WAS TOLD--
YES OR NO.
THERE'S NO EXPLANATION.
OKAY.
DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING
HOME?
YES OR NO OR I'LL MOVE ON.
AND THEN YOU SCREW YOURSELF.
I'M GOING-- I DID NOT KNOW
THAT YOU WERE GOING HOME.
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO KNOW.
YOU LIE.
THANK YOU.
Jeff: WHITNEY, YOU'RE UP.
CONGRATULATIONS.
UHM, ALBERT, YOU ARE SLEAZY.
A LITTLE SLEAZY.
I FELT LIKE YOU BUTTERED PEOPLE
UP WHEN YOU KNEW THEY WERE
LEAVING THE GAME.
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAD
ANY REAL INTENTION TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE AGAINST YOUR ALLIANCE.
COACH, I FEEL LIKE YOU USED
CHRISTIANITY TO MANIPULATE YOUR
WHOLE TRIBE, AND PUT FEAR INTO
THEM, ACTUALLY.
SOPHIE, THE REASON I FIND IT
HARD TO WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN FOR
A MILLION DOLLARS IS YOU ARE THE
MOST CONDESCENDING PERSON I'VE
EVER MET.
YOU TOOK ZERO TIME TO GET TO
KNOW ANYBODY, REALLY.
DEFINITELY--
I THINK I SAID THIS IN THE
BEGINNING.
I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S PART OF
WHO I AM.
I THINK I AM REALLY HARD TO GET
TO KNOW.
AND I'M VERY BLUNT.
I'M VERY INTIMIDATING.
AND I THINK THAT IT'S JUST PART
OF, LIKE, HOW I COME OFF.
AND I THINK THAT AFTER THIS
GAME, AND AFTER HEARING ALL THE
FEEDBACK, I THINK IT'S NOT SUCH
A GOOD QUALITY AS I THOUGHT IT
WAS.
YEAH, DEFINITELY NOT.
I THINK IT'S WEAKNESS.
OKAY, THANKS.
Jeff: EDNA.
YOU'RE UP.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WE'RE ALL HERE TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR."
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
AND THE INHERENT INGREDIENT IS
MANIPULATION.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE
MANIPULATED.
THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME WE'RE
GOING TO BE MANIPULATING PEOPLE.
AND WHAT IS THE MOST HISTORIC
WAY TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE?
THROUGH RELIGION.
THAT WAS SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZEED.
WE SHOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE
FEELING DUPED.
IT WAS OUR OWN FAULT.
WE VOLUNTARILY KIM HERE TO BE
DUPED.
AND WE SHOULDN'T HOLD ANY HARD
FEELINGS BY THESE PEOPLE DUPING
US BECAUSE WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS
AND THESE PEOPLE DID IT
SUCCESSFULLY.
THEY MANAGED TO DUPE EACH ONE OF
US.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Jeff: THANKS, EDNA.
KEITH.
I WANT TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS, OF COURSE.
MY QUESTION IS TO YOU, COACH,
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
IDOL.
YOU DIDN'T DNOT PLAY IT AT ALL.
WERE YOU GOING TO USE THAT
IMMUNITY IDOL INDIVIDUALLY OR
FOR THE TEAM?
I DID THINK IT WAS A TRIBE
IDOL.
THE ONE TIME THEY WOULD HAVE
PLAYED IT WAS AT THE 6-6 MERGE
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND WE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT
THAT--
SO THEY'LL ALL REITERATE THAT
POINT?
YEAH, BECAUSE BEFORE COCHRAN
APPROACHED ME I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IF IT WAS A
6-6 AND THERE WAS NO OTHER VOTE
WHERE WE COULD SWING IT, WHO
WOULD THEY VOTE OUT.
I DIDN'T PLAY IT BECAUSE I
DIDN'T NEED TO PLAY IT.
I CAN CLEAR SOMETHING UP
ABOUT THE IDOL, TOO.
THE IDOL WAS ACTUALLY NOT FOUND
THE WAY UPOLU THOUGHT IT WAS
FOUND.
ALBERT FOUND THE CLUE WITH THE
HELP OF COACH AND I DISTRACTING
THE TEAM.
COACH THEN FOUND THE IDOL, AND
WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WE WOULD
KEEP IT FOR THE THREE OF US.
AND THEN IT GOT TO THE POINT
BRANDON WAS HUNTING LIKE
ANYTHING FOR AN IDOL THAT WASN'T
THERE ANYMORE.
SO WE STAGED A DISCOVERY OF THE
IDOL.
OKAY.
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
Jeff: THANKS, KEITH.
COCHRAN.
YOU KNOW, MORE THAN ANYONE
ELSE IN THIS GAME, I WAS SUCH A
FAN OF COACH.
YOU REALLY TRICKED ME.
YOU KNOW, YOU STROKE MID EGO.
YOU CALLED ME HERCULES.
I DID TAI CHI.
AND I LOVED THAT.
YOU TRICKED ME.
YOU GOT ME.
AND I THINK YOU PLAYED A REALLY
IMPRESSIVE GAME.
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE IN
THE FINAL THREE WITH YOU,
INCLUDING ME.
I INDUSTRIAL BELIEVE IT.
I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD.
I'M IN THE FINAL THREE WITH
COACH.
THIS IS AWESOME.
WHAT I DON'T APPRECIATE IS YOU
TALK ABOUT HONOR.
YOU SAID ITT SO FREQUENTLY THE
WORD MEANS NOTHING ME.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD SHARE YOUR
STRATEGY BUT DON'T TALK ABOUT
HONOR.
I WAIL KALE INTO THIS GAME
WANTING TO DO RIGHT THING AND
WHEN YOU TRY TO PLEASE EVERYBODY
YOU END UP DOING THE WRONG
THINGS.
I TRIED AND FELL SHORT AND I
STABBED A LOT OF YOU IN THE BACK
AND I'M SORRY I DID WHAT I DID
TO GET HERE.
I KNEW IT WAS MY THIRD AND FINAL
TIME AND I WANTED TO GET TO THE
END AND EVERY DAY I WOULD
JUSTIFY MY ACTIONS AND IN THE
END IT BECAME ONE BIG CONVOLUTED
EXPHES I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET
OUT OF IT.
IT WAS LIKE A DECK OF CARDS.
I KEPT STACKING IT UP AND
STACKING IT UP AND NOW EVERYBODY
HATES ME AND THE DECK OF CARDS
IS GONE AND THE GAME I TRIED TO
PLAY IS IN SHAMBLES AND AS I'VE
PROVEN SINCE DAY ONE SINCE I'VE
BEEN ON "SURVIVOR."
I'M A TERRIBLE STRAIT GER.
IN MY REAL LIFE I'M A DECENT
PERSON.
I'M NOT A STRATEGIST.
IT'S PROBABLY MY FAULT.
BECAUSE I WAS THE STRATEGIST.
I WAS THE ORIGINAL-- COACH.
THANKS.
Jeff: OKAY, THERE HAS BEEN
A LOT SAID TONIGHT.
NOW, YOU, THE JURY, HAVE A VERY
BIG DECISION TO MAKE.
WHICH ONE OF THESE THREE ARE YOU
GOING TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS
TO?
ALBERT, COACH, OR SOPHIE.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT
TO THINK ABOUT YOUR VOTE.
Jeff: OKAY, ALBERT, COACH,
SOPHIE, IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
JURY, YOU ARE VOTING FOR A
WINNER, THE PERSON YOU FEEL MOST
DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION DOLLAR
CHECK.
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.
JIM, YOU'RE UP.
JIM, YOU'RE UP.
IF YOU WIPE OUT ALL THE
GARBAGE ABOUT HONOR, INTEGRITY,
LOVE AND COMPASSION, PLAYED A
GREAT GAME, MAN.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR.
I HOPE THE RIFT OF THE JURY
ISN'T SUPER BITTER AND VOTES
BASED ON WHO PLAYED THE BEST
GAME AND IT WAS YOU, COACH.
SO I HOPE YOU WIN.
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU BECAUSE I
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A
MILLION TROOPS SMILE.
MILLION TROOPS SMILE.
Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'LL GO GET THE VOTES.
ALBERT, COACH, SOPHIE,
CONGRATULATIONS.
JURY, THANK YOU.
I WILL SEE ALL OF YOU BACK IN
LOS ANGELES FOR THE READING OF
THE VOTES.
THE VOTES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jeff: ALL RIGHT!
COME ON DOWN!
THANK YOU.
ALWAYS GOOD TO BE LIVE.
( CHEERS )
ALL RIGHT.
A WORTHY RESPONSE FOR A WORTHY
SEASON.
NICE JOB TO EVERYBODY UP HERE.
YEAH.
( APPLAUSE )
BUT HERE'S WHERE WE SIT.
ALBERT, COACH, SOPHIE, NO MATTER
HOW YOU GET TO THE END, I SAY
THIS EVERY TIME AT THE FINAL
VOTE, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
IT'S VERY TOUGH TO GET TO THE
END OF THIS GAME NO MATTER HOW
YOU GET THERE.
SO FOR THAT, YOU SHOULD BE
PROUD.
WHAT'S TRICKY IS THERE'S ONLY
ONE WINNER.
AND THAT'S THE DILEMMA.
HOW DO YOU VOTE PEOPLE OUT OF
THIS GAME, YOUR JURY, AND THEN
GET THEM TO TURN AROUND AND VOTE
FOR YOU TO WIN?
THAT'S THE SOCIAL POLITICS THAT
IS ALWAYS AT PLAY ON "SURVIVOR."
ONE OF YOU DID IT BETTER THAN
THE OTHER TWO.
TIME TO FIND OUT WHO IS THE
WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: SOUTH
PACIFIC."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M GOING TO READ THE VOTES.
TONIGHT, YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR
NAME ON THE PARCHMENT.
THESE ARE GOOD VOTES.
THESE ARE VOTES FOR A WINNER AND
A MILLION DOLLARS.
UNFORTUNATELY, OZZY IS NOT UP
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.
( LAUGHTER ).
BUT ALBERT, COACH, AND SOPHIE
ARE, AND HERE WE GO.
FIRST VOTE, COACH.
( CHEERS )
SOPHIE.
( APPLAUSE )
ONE VOTE COACH, ONE VOTE SOPHIE.
COACH.
( APPLAUSE )
TWO VOTES COACH, ONE VOTE
SOPHIE.
SOPHIE.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES COACH, TWO VOTES
SOPHIE.
COACH.
( APPLAUSE )
THREE VOTES COACH, TWO VOTES
SOPHIE.
SOPHIE.
THREE VOTES COACH, THREE VOTES
SOPHIE.
SOPHIE.
FOUR VOTES SOPHIE, THREE VOTES
COACH.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: SOUTH
PACIFIC," SOPHIE.
Jeff: WELL, THIS SEASON SAW
THE RETURN OF COACH AND OZZY,
TWO OF OUR MOST POPULAR PLAYERS,
BOTH SEEKING ARE DEMPTION.
THE QUESTION IS DID EITHER ONE
OF THEM FIND IT?
PLUS COCHRAN MADE SOME FRIENDS,
MADE SOME ENEMIES.
HE MADE AN IMPACT.
AND BRANDON HANTZ, ONE OF THE
MOST EMOTIONAL TO EVER PLAY THE
GAME, HE'S THE NEPHEW OF RUSSELL
HANTZ, THE MOST NOTORIOUS
VILLAIN IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR."
BRANDON WILL SHARE HIS
EXPERIENCE AND RUSSELL IS HERE
AS WELL AND WILL SHARE HIS
OPINION ABOUT HOW BRANDON
PLAYED.
OH, AND SOPHIE WON A MILLION
BUCKS.
WE'LL TALK TO THEM ALL NEXT.
IT IS THE "SURVIVOR: SOUTH
PACIFIC" REUNION SHOW LIVE FROM
LOS ANGELES.
