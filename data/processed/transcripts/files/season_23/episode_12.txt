        Previously on survivors
Since day one,Coach has
been the driving force
behind an impenetrable alience of five
We got Rick,Brandon,Sophie,Alber,and
you've got myself
And he added anna as the sixth
I can't lie to anybody anymore
But Brandon shattered any
illussions that edna had about
moving up in the pecking order
Brandon said the other five
peoples and the allience
have basically just tolerated me.
We are merged.








After the two tribers
merged,they were dead even.
At this point,it's a
dead-locked,6-6 vote
You are the most
powerful man in the game
But coach somehow convinced cochran to
jump from six at the old
savaii to seven in his allience
- Who is the strongest,strongest man on earth they called him?
- Hercules
Yep. Absolutely
I convinced cochran he
will be the man of the match
Keith,the tribe has spoken
With the number advantage,the
old upolu triber picked off
the Old savaii tribe one by one
Whitney,the tribe has spoken
Leaving ozzy,dawn,and
whitney at redemption island
oh,man








Waiting to battle it out for
a shot at returning to the game
The good news is the seven of
you have accomplished your goal
The bad news--
nowhere left to hide
This game is about to change
TE TUNA NIGHT 27
They are seven
We have eradicated all
former Savaii members
we have seven left and we're all family
so now we have to start
sending home some of our own
I think I'm getting used
to seeing my name at Tribal
- was anybody worried tonight or not really? 
- No
Coming back from tribal
At least the sense of paranoia
Because now people have
ideas floating around
who is five,six and seven
and who is not in that top four?
I'm deluded into thinking I'm safe
like i said at
tribal,I'mGoing to stick to it
I am happy with my my decision
no vacillating,no questioning
Tribal council was
kind of alarming to me
because it was made clear I was
the person that was going in seven
Thank you for adopting
me into your family
doesn't this feel great?
It feels like
we're finally--Like
Like when there are so
many people here I hate it
It doesn't feel like we're a tribe
after surviving another
night I realize the family
could turn on me at any moment
so I'll Really reevaluating what I
need to do to get further in this game
to make sure I'm not
taken out by the family
Gosh,helter-skelter.
{a6}TE TUNA DAY 28
I was a good kid and done well in school
but fifth grade for whatever reason
was kind of my rambunctus period.
I wassed to change my
reputation As a brown noser
so the nastiest thing I could think
of was to start prank calling people.
I went back to my house
I didn't have a good
idea of how sex worked
so I was calling these
girls and saying thingsLike,
"I think you're so hot. I really
want to trade sperm with you."
I'm sorry
and then I'd hang up and think
that was a successful prank call.
I always thought his
personality is something
cochran has going for him out here.
When I first came here I
felt kind of bad for cochran
because I felt like
people were bullying him
but I can see now why
people got annoyed with him
You know,I get frustrated by
the kind of air he puts on.
I think he's really
proud of the move he made
and I think he still thinks that
somebody will take him to the end.
I don't like it.
There has kind of always been this
cult-like quality to the Upolu family
Just hearing the word "family"
over and over you can't help
but think of charles
manson and the Manson family
and the family that created
so many heinous murders.
holy god,help us to stay
strong,stay away from temptation,
father god,don't get angry with each
other and we'll just stay a family
in Jesus' name,amen.
brandon in particular seems
almost obsessively devout,
to the point where it seems like he's trying
to suppress something a lot more scary.
I don't want to be sharon
tate in this scenario
and I need some sort of plan or
else I'm going to be exterminated.
I'm going to be given the poison
Kool-aid and meet my untimely Demise.
I am hoping ************
Coming on in,guys
Basically what I wanted to talk about is
I realize that my name is
probably being floated around
to be the next person
voted out of the tribe
and it makes sense because I'm new here
but I made A big sacrifice
to kind of change my game
and I feel like the upolu
tribe did benefit from It.
So basically all I'm asking
is for the debt to be paid back
just by saving me from
one Tribal council.
I'm not asking you to promise
me final four or even final five.
I would just really,really
Appreciate it.
And it is my birthday in three Days
so I'd love to celebrate
my Birthday with all of you.
If you want to talk about it I'm
Willing to leave and let you all Discuss.
- All right.
- thanks,cochran.
cochran said,"I know a lot
Of you feel indebtedded to me.
" I don't feel indebtedded
to you. Screw you.
He made an awful move. He
should have stuck with his Tribe.
I'll be honest,guys,I'm
not Really going to say much
because I think he makes a valid
point But it's not my opinion.
It's the opinion of us five.
Whatever you want to do I'll Support.
I agree with albert,he
Sacrificed so much for us
and I Want it to be a group decision.
I would say that I would
vote For switching it
to keep cochran Here another day.
yes,I think he made big Moves but
I feel just as Indebted
to edna as I do to Cochran.
So if this is a democracy,my
Vote is for cochran.
albert and I see we do owe
Cochran another day in this Game.
If we could just pull one
more Vote to keep cochran.
We've gotten down to the seven.
Everybody is fighting to be
 standing at the bitter end.

******** What's on your agenda?
I was going to go fishing
but Cochran wanted to go
and when it Comes to fishing,
three is Company but four's a crowd.
do you have any clothes to Watch?
edna is out there doing the
Laundry and the funny thing is,
You know,this is "survivor"
the Ultimate strategy game.
The flairs my alliance think
It's not outwit,outplay,Outlast.
They think it's
outclean,Outgather,outorganize.
To me this game is about
doing Well in challenges,
creating a Great strategy,and
playing a Strong social game.
So those are what I'm focused On.
I'll leave the housework
to Martha stewart.
awesome,man.
it's got teeth so be careful.
what do I do? I'm
afraid of hurting myself.
you're what?
brandon just caught this Giant,really scary looking fish
That have these kind of Intimidatinglooking fang teeth
And I'm in charge of holding it
But it seems to have some life In it
so I'm nervous it will
Resurrect and attack me.
But whatever it takes to feed Our tribe
I'm willing to put our
Plaintiff and limb in danger
and Brandon is doing an awesome job
Of fishing and I'm happy to help Out.
I feel like I'm part of the Team.
I didn't physically catch
it,But I'm physically holding it
And I'll bingly be the one
to Bring it back to camp
and him The one they'll
hoist on their Shoulders.
*************
everybody worked real hard Today,man.
*******
I appreciate you coming
out There and helping us.
I'm glad to help. this guy was so
patient. He was sitting there...
bye,edna. bye.
do**********
********
albert proceeded to lay in The hammock
and watch me for two Hours
while I did the laundry,
And when I stepped away from
the Laundry for one minute,
I come Back to the
fire being doused Out,
and the embers are wet and You can't
get the fire started That easily.
Oh,that was so infuriating.
Albert does pretty much
nothing Except lie around
and eat fish And wait for
other people to Wait on him.
I don't think albert has done
A day of work in his life.
I think that both has been Handclothed,
handbathed by his
Mother since he was two.
he just literally stay on
the Hammock for two hours
and so now I was like there's
no fire,the Laundry is not done
and albert Hasn't done anything.
He al literally sat there.
there's********
albert is a kind of
precious Thing in camp.
He's like one of those barbie Dolls.
They look cute because they Don't
do do anything and sit There.
That's why I call him prince Albert. It's
like I'm the prince and you Guys work for me.
It just kills me.
tell me I'm basically next Person to
go after cochran. Is that still true?
I think so,yes.
why?
because it's time to start
Picking everybody off one on One.
I know,but why am I next?
I found out I'm basically the
Next person to go after cochran
Which makes me feel as though I
Am pretty low on the totem pole.
I definitely have to
shake it up Right now
because sixth or Seventh
is not acceptable for Me.
Do you have any suggestions,any Ideas?
What's your plan,coach?
My understanding is we're at a
Consensus that cook ran is next?
yes.
Keeping edna and cochran would
Be the best thing for me to do
Because they're never going to Vote
me out so it's really like A catch22.
Which side should I go at this Point.
Do I want to honor my
word,be a Man of integrity,
stick with the Five or do
I want to go another Route?
Nothing is for sure in this game
{a6}**********

Explanations for his decision.

*********
******
oh,my gosh!
walking back into camp,Everything
is laid out for Cochran and I.
We've got two massage tables Ready.
We've got a shower to the left Side.
We've got two beautiful south Pacific
women that are ready to Massage us.
There's oils there.
Everything smells
beautiful,Fresh,new,clean.
The water's like it like Smells
scented like jasmine or Something.
Cochran,it's unbelievable.
Let me tell you.
I'm trying not to use all the Water.
yeah,try a little bit Harder.
Up to this point,I've
never had A massage.
I'm thrilled to see that,you
Know,some stupid little white Lie about
when my birthday was Which
actually took place six Months ago
is helping me Somewhat in this game,
even if It's to get a free massage.
how does it feel?
it feels great.
I mean,having a beautiful woman Stroke the
inside of my legs is A new experience for me.
this is just amazingly Rejuvenating to have
this kind Of treatment out here on day 30.
I couldn't ask for
anything Better than that.
Actually,I could ask for
Cochran's life to be saved Tonight.
I will fight for my man cochran
With my last dying breath.
Of that you can be
assured,my Young warrior.
I've upgraded to warrior.
Wasn't I a student before?
you're a young warrior right now.
*******Reward,
I pulled aside albert,Not only to thank
him but to Kind of get a feeling of
whether He was willing to
continue Working with me,
knowing full Well that
my name is,you know,
The one being floated around
the Most to be voted out tonight.
quite frankly,it's not
Looking too good for your case.
I was pretty sure coach was on Board.
I was able to sway him a
little Bit and talk him into it.
The problem is I don't think
He's ready to make a huge move
That would be getting rid of,Like,a rick
I know he is.I know for a fact he is.
- you think so?
- no question.
Coach will vote out rick.
He calls him princess albert.
- when did you hear that?
- around the fire yesterday.
Look,I'm telling you I'm not
Obviously,I'm in survival mode Right now,
but I'm telling you 100%.
you don't know how happy it Would make me
to see you go Father than rick in this game.
It could make me ecstatic.
rick,to begin with,he's About
as smart as a bowling Ball,
and then I hear he's
Chirping in the background,
Calling me names,dropping
a Princess here and there.
Are you kidding me,rick?
I have a mind to get
rid of rick On this vote.
******* I just don't know if he'd do it.
I promise you this if he does
it,you can count on me,100%.
what's ******
I just *******
*******
Because he heard about the Princess
albert. That annoys him a lot.
- good.
- he wants to vote out rick.*******
dude. I'm on board.
Albert caught wind that rick was
Calling him princess albert,Prince albert
because he doesn't Do
anything around camp.
Cochran and I trying
to use that Information
to try to get coach To come
with us to vote rick Off.
I feel like if we don't use
you To our maximum benefit,
part of The reason we won
that last Group challenge
and were 66 Into the
merge is because of You.
I think that we owe you
more of A,you know,debt.
I like you. I like coach.
yeah. I like you,too.
I talked to albert. He gave me this
whole spiel it's not looking so good.
SO ******
Rick's *******
He's *****
If *******
we have *********
I mean *******
He said *******
He just *******
********* Way I go
is going to determine
The rest of this game.
There is a tide that is coming.
I either take it and
go with a New alliance,
or stay with my First five.
As william shakespeare says,
There's a tide that comes in
the Lives of men that when taken,
Leads to great fortune.
But when omidst it,all the rest Of their
lives are bound in Shadows and misery.
I want to make sure that
I make The right decision.
I want to make sure
they take The right tide
so that I can Ride that tide all the way to
The end of this game that I love so dearly.
*********The members of our jury.
Jim. Keith. Dawn. And whitney.
Coach,where does this rank in
Terms of all the possibilities
That could happen with tonight's Vote?
I think the possibilities are Endless.
I mean,they really are
because Nobody really knows
if they're Going to the final three,
if They're four,five,six,or Seven.
There's a new scenario
that's Presented to me
and albert and Everybody
here every hour.
It's been crazy.
Cochran,did you feel The
scrambling happening today?
oh,absolutely because I took Part in it.
I'm sure it's going to
fill the Jury with glee
to discover I'm Probably
in great danger Tonight,
and I feel like an Idiot kind of.
I don't mean to sound greedy
but I'm here to collect a debt.
I gave life to this tried
and to Be targeted for seventh
it's a Little bit humiliating.
I feel a little bit duped.
The massage was one nice
way of Paying off the debt
but I feel Like I'm entitled to at
least One more night in this game.
just to comment on that
point I vocalize to the tribe
I Thought it's not in the best
Interest of our quote,unquote Image,
to use and abuse someone,
And I don't regret my decision
Of giving him the reward,
and I Don't want him
to regret his Decision.
Coach,does it Concern you a little
when you Have albert saying,"
I think Cochran's right?
" as everybody knows,we're
in This good standing
because Cochran made a move that
some People considered cowardice.
Others,including myself,Thought
it was very bold and Courageous.
Rick,are you worried At all if
cochran does play his Card tonight
that means it's one Of the other six?
oh,absolutely because
it's a Million bucks,yeah.
I've got my bags packed. I
really don't want to go,but,Yeah.
Edna,are you Emotional
tonight or are you
yeah,I'm a little emotional
Because I feel like I'm sixth,
You know,the perception
that The six were equal.
That was a delusion.
I was led to think that I was Equal
in certain people's minds,We weren't.
So your emotion is Anger,hurt,sadness?
sadness. I feel like I've already
been Deceived leading up to here,
Like,okay,I'm sixth.
That doesn't feel very good.
So,edna,if cochran Believes he's
seventh and you Believe you're sixth,
all you Need is to find
who's fifth and Who's fourth
because they're not In the money,either.
yeah,sure.
Talk to people and find a
little Crack,and expanding that.
It's a little bit of a publicity Act.
So we have to find certain
Angles and approach them.
- Jeff.
- Brandon.
everybody here knows what's
Going to happen for these two.
That's why tonight
I'm voting Out cochran
and then the next Night
my vote is for edna.
Let's not try to be so gray out
There and just get it out there.
I do believe there's black
and White and if there's gray,
you Might as well be
lying,to be Honest with you.
Coach,brandon now Poses a huge
problem for anybody In his alliance.
He is not malleable.
So if something goes haywire With
our plan,brandon ain't Going to help.
right,the fact that brandon Is not malleable
in this game is Both a blessing and a curse.
If you're with him,you know That
he's not going to turn on You,
but you're also afraid that
He's going to spilt apple cart.
Brandon,are you Exhausted right now?
yeah.
What has tried you
The most in this game?
I want to do wrong things. I'm human.
But I there's something
stro Stronger inside me
that won't Let me.
Anything worth having
is not Going to be easy.
So that's all I'm
telling myself In my head.
Anything worth having
is not Going to be easy.
That's all.
Cochran,as hard as It is to see
brandon upset from A game point of view,
it's a Spark of life.
Maybe this is too much for him.
I mean,I think brandon's Revealed
he's probably not the Best person
to be in a strategic Partnership with.
Talking strait with brandon is Like talking
to you about shirts That aren't blue blue.
He doesn't comprehend it.
It isn't in his vocabulary.
I wouldn't want to come up
with Strategic ideas with him
because He doesn't
understand that Language.

Character aside,not the Greatest
strategy player out Here?
yeah. I think it's
sometimes unsettle Glg
so if something happens in This game and
your alliance has To make a different move
and Brandon says,"wish I could,Can't.
" I think right now
the way our Tribe is
I'm not concerned about Anything
happening in the game.And I think
if edna wins immunity,what Happens?
then it starts.
This has been a bit Of an
eyeopening tribal,hasn't It
- no?
- no.
Really?
So,cochran,how frustrating is It
if the move you made was for Naught?
it's intensely frustrating.
I thought I was being
some savvy Game player
and then I get voted
Out in a worse position
than I Probably would have
if I stuck With my old tribe.
It's extremely humiliating.
I pride myself on being
a "survivor" expert.
I hope this turns out to be one Of the most
idiotic moves in the History of the game.
It has been one of The most interesting
and Revealing tribal councils of the Season.
Albert has the necklace,cannot Vote
for albert. Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote. Brandon,you're up.
cochran,thanks for making The big
move when you made it. Happy birthday.
******** Down.
Hopefully the other three people In our
suballiance will be writing your name down,t
*******
If anybody has the hidden Immunity
idol and you want to Play it,
now would be the time To do so.
Okay,once the votes
read,the Decision is final.
The person voted out will be Asked to
leave the tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote,cochran.
Rick.
Rick. Two votes rick,one vote Cochran.
Cochran. We're tied,two
votes cochran,Two votes rick.
Cochran. That's three votes
cochran,two Votes rick.
13th person voted out of
"survivor: South pacific," Cochran.
That's four. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.
Cochran,the tribe has spoken.
You will have a chance
to get Back in this game.
Grab your torch,head to
Redemption island. Good luck.
jeff probst,just snuffed my Torch.
It's unreal. A dream come true.

- Just take the steps.
Well,there was a lot Of
information revealed tonight,
And your future in this game Will
be determined by what you Do with it.
Grab your torches. head
back to camp. Good night.
**** "survivor":
our tribe is honor and Integrity,
and then you allow Such behavior.
Brandon's in deep Trouble.
on a day we thought edna was
Definitely going to go home
That's not the case anymore.
And cochran is in Even deeper.
Think *****
you have a chance.
He really doesn't stand a chance.
the bick move I made at the
Merge in jumping over to upolu,
In retrospect,may not
have been The best move.
I absolutely feel like upolu Used me.
The fact that they did
absolutely nothing to show any ***
