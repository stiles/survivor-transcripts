 --- 

         PROBST: Parvati, come on out.
 I have to win this time.
It's my second time.
I am not coming back here to
starve and be miserable.
Outwardly, I'm still going to be
flirty, but I'm playing smart
this time.
I've put us in an alliance
without you being there.
I would absolutely say that my








game was a lot more cutthroat.
 PROBST: Ozzy.
 All the girls are coming
together and spinning the guys
around as much as we can, and
then we're devouring them.
I don't feel like I could have
played this game better, and I
feel like I can stand up tall
and be like, "I am a survivor."
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: We're live in New
York City.
We've just finished one of our








most enjoyable seasons of
Survivor, thanks to a fantastic
group.
Let's start by congratulating
our winner, Parvati.
Nice job.
( cheering and applause )
You said it yourself, that you
came into this... everybody who
was a favorite came in with a
label.
You were the flirt.
Did you have an idea that you
were going to start playing as
hard as you did on day one when
you came in?
 Oh, God, no.
I wasn't going to start playing
in the beginning.
I was going to fly under the
radar and play the flirt and let
everyone underestimate me.
Jonathan....
 PROBST: Penner.
 ...outed me and said, "This
girl's a threat; we got to get
rid of her."
And I was like, "Okay, I got to
start playing," got my head in
the game, and started making
moves.
 PROBST: When did the idea for
the women's alliance first come
to you-- you guys?
 Honestly, I came up with that
when we had the switch up.
I didn't have the numbers
anymore, and I saw that Nat and
Alexis were pretty unbreakable,
so I pulled them in.
And then I said, "There's no way
I can beat Ozzy and James."
So we got the women together.
 PROBST: Was the biggest move
for you bringing in Alexis and
Natalie?
 I would say yeah.
With the women that I brought
together, we had this game on
lock.
Like, these girls-- I couldn't
have done it without the girls
that I was with, because
everyone played their part.
Everyone was so brilliant at
manipulating and getting in
people's heads and ruining
people, basically.
( laughter )
 PROBST: It also seemed,
Parvati, from a strategic point
of view, you bring in Alexis and
Natalie while Amanda's not
around.
You now have two girls on one
side; you have Cirie and Amanda
on the other.
 Yeah.
I mean, that was also in my
mind.
I was, you know, the pinnacle of
that alliance, and I knew... I
knew that Alexis and Natalie
felt more loyal to me, and Cirie
and Amanda felt more loyal to
me.
So however the chips fell, I
knew I was in a safe spot.
 PROBST: Amanda, let's talk
about some of the records you
now hold on Survivor.
 Quite a few, Jeff.
 PROBST: It's true.
Record number of days on the
show-- 78.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: You went back-to-back
seasons, made it to the final.
You won the challenges that let
you dictate who you'd bring with
you.
 In the same, the same, the
last two in both.
 PROBST: The last two.
 Yeah.
 PROBST: You also... both of
your original alliances made it
to the end...
 Yeah.
 PROBST: ...which is pretty
spectacular.
But you don't win.
 I know.
It's a problem I'm having.
( laughter )
 Third time's a charm.
 PROBST: What is the wear and
tear, emotionally, when you go
through this?
Especially, you did it back-to-
back.
You and James came back from
China, you had a few weeks to
recover from the bites, and you
went back out.
Where is your head at now after
playing a game this long that's
about deceit?
 Oh, my God.
It is so hard to go back to real
life.
And you're just... honestly,
this has been my life for a
while now.
Like, I know it's a game, but
it's been my life.
Like, this is what I've been
doing for, like, two seasons now
in a row.
And you get back to reality, and
it's just, you know, you have
trust issues, and you just...
( laughter )
Seriously.
You don't trust anybody.
And you're like, "Maybe they're
not telling me the truth, and
maybe they're just, like, trying
to say that to make me think
something else."
You know?
It's hard.
It's really hard.
 PROBST: And what does it feel
like right now, not winning
again?
Because you're one of the
strongest players in the game.
 It sucks!
I know, and it's frustrating.
But, I mean, honestly, like, at
the end of the game, it's not up
to you.
It's up to different people.
And different people vote for
different things, and you don't
know what they're going to vote
for or respect or like, and
it's... honestly, it's, like,
impossible to guess.
All you can do is get yourself
to the end.
And then from there, just.. it's
up to the jury.
It's out of your hands.
 PROBST: Cirie, how many
nights have you spent thinking
about that last challenge?
 Oh, let's see, what day is it
now?
( laughter )
Every single night.
Every single night.
 PROBST: Was that your only
mistake, your biggest mistake,
if you can call it a mistake?
 Honestly, yeah.
I feel like the only mistake I
made in this game was not
winning the last immunity
challenge.
But for that, who knows?
( laughter )
 PROBST: Tell me about the
women's alliance.
Did you guys sit and talk about
how easy... how easily the men
were being manipulated?
 Well, I mean, kind of.
( laughter )
I mean, it was...
 PROBST: Did you know it was
going to work?
 Certain things with certain
people...
( laughter )
I kind of... I mean, you can...
you have to be able to read
people to know, you know, like--
sorry you touched the stove--
but this thing that happened
with Erik I would have never
tried with Penner, because I
knew it wouldn't work for him.
 PROBST: So you had the right
group of times at the right
time.
 We had the right group of
guys.
They were younger.
They were a little more naive.
And, you know, that's why it
worked.
Gina, I love you.
I'm praying for you.
 PROBST: Okay.
It's Mother's Day.
It's all right.
Natalie, you come out of nowhere
as this raving fill in the
blank.
( laughter )
What's been the reaction to you
on the street?
 You know, I've had some
pretty nasty responses on
MySpace.
I have some haters, which is
cool.
 PROBST: Is that... is that
representative of you?
Because you seemed to relish the
role.
 You know, actually, I knew
going in that I had to really
play under the radar, because
I'm very opinionated.
I'm very stern and stoic in my
beliefs, and I am not shy about
letting people know what I feel.
So I knew going in I had to play
under the radar.
And then when it was time for me
to come out, I came out.
And it's okay.
 PROBST: Is that you?
 There are a million layers to
me as a human being.
I'm a very complex individual.
 PROBST: Is that one of them?
( laughter )
 I'm a loving, kind, generous,
amazing human being, and that's
one of the layers.
That's one of the pieces of the
pie.
Yes, it is, absolutely, 100%.
 PROBST: Alexis, you're the
only woman that got blindsided
by your own women's alliance.
What's that feel like?
It's got to hurt a little bit.
 It hurts a lot.
But I think that there's this
constant duality while you're
out there where we get it.
We know what we signed up for.
We know it's a game.
But at the same time, it's a
testament to what Amanda is
saying.
It is so personal.
And it takes a little while for
your heart to catch up with your
head.
 PROBST: Well, it was
masterfully done.
I must say.
And thanks, in large part, to
the women's alliance, it was one
of the most unpredictable
seasons we've ever had with some
of the biggest blindsides and
dumbest moves.
( laughter )
Second person voted out of
Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,
Mary.
First blindside.
Mike.
Joel.
 I found the idol!
I found the idol!
 PROBST: Ozzy.
 The real hidden immunity
idol.
 PROBST: Jason.
Alexis.
You guys are perfecting the art
of the blindside.
 I want to give individual
immunity to Natalie.
 PROBST: 13th person voted out
and the sixth member of our
jury, Erik.
I think that is what you call a
life lesson.
( cheering and applause )
Ozzy, did you ever consider
playing the idol?
 Oh, hell, yeah.
I considered it.
I considered it about five times
before we got up to that point.
But...
 PROBST: Why did you not play
it that night?
 Well, it's risky.
It's just... honestly, if it had
been anyone else but Parvati on
my side, I probably would have
played it.
But you know, I went into the
game with a relationship with
Parvati, and it... it's... I
knew I needed to trust more than
I was trusting in Cook Islands.
And you know, I said it before;
that ended up being my downfall.
And I had a lot of harsh words
for her at the end, and it...
you know, it's like I can
understand how someone might be
able to kill in the heat of
passion.
( laughter )
But at this point, you know,
I've... I've... I've forgiven,
and I'm over it.
And it's... you know, she's an
amazing girl, and she's... I
respect her a lot.
( applause )
 PROBST: So the relationship
has healed?
 Yeah.
 PROBST: All right.
Jason, first of all, you find...
you find the fake idol, which
leads to one of the greatest
lines ever uttered on Survivor,
Eliza.
 It's just a bleeping stick!
 PROBST: Yes.
( laughter )
Which, by the way, what was your
reaction when you... you thought
he had the idol, and then you
see this thing that Ozzy made.
 Oh, yeah.
I thought he was pulling one
over on me.
I mean, I opened my bag thinking
he'd put the hidden immunity
idol in there.
And I was like, "Well, he can't
possibly think this is the
hidden immunity idol, so what's
he trying to pull?"
And I storm down to the beach
and kind of give him a peace of
my mind, and at that point, I
realize he did, in fact, think
that the stick with a face on it
was the hidden immunity idol,
and I knew I was done.
 PROBST: So, Jason-- and we
adore you-- but you watch your
idol, Ozzy, make the fatal
mistake of not playing the idol.
You think you have the real one.
No.
You get another lesson.
That's not the real one.
Oh, now I have the real one, and
you do the same thing!
How many sleepless nights have
you had?
 Uh, more than I'd like to
think about, you know.
It was... just it was a mistake,
you know, lack of logical
thinking.
And I should have seen it coming
with it happening to Ozzy.
And yeah...
 PROBST: I mean, you end up
with a souvenir.
That's basically it.
 Yeah, yeah.
I got it right here.
 PROBST: I'm sure you do.
 So, you know, I got this
sitting home on my desk to
remind me of that mistake that I
made all the time.
And it was, you know, just a bad
move and something I'll never...
never let down.
 PROBST: Well, and James,
you're just delighted to have
somebody in your club.
( cheering and applause )
You're not the only one.
Ozzy and Jason certainly put
themselves in the Survivor
hall of fame for dumb moves, but
they pale in comparison to
Survivor fan Erik.
Dumbest move ever?
Perhaps.
It's true.
Plus, Fans vs. Favorites, did
one side have a distinct
advantage?
We'll find out when we come
back.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: You are you going to
compete against some of your
favorite survivors from seasons
past.
 Oh, my God!
 PROBST: Come on out!
Jonathan Penner.
Parvati.
 The fans versus favorites
setup is the ultimate challenge,
because we have the favorites;
they're coming in here with the
experience.
But at the same time, you have
us, and we know their game.
 PROBST: Yau-Man!
( cheering and applause )
Welcome back to the Survivor:
Fans vs. Favorites live reunion
show.
Penner, did the favorites have
an advantage this season coming
in?
 Absolutely.
I mean, I think I was the... I
did the worst at Cook Islands.
I was seventh from the last.
So I think between the ten of
us, we figured we had about a
year's worth of Survivor
experience between us hitting
the beach, and that gave us an
incredible advantage.
We have a fire within a day.
We had two shelters within a
day, a cave in another day.
We were catching food within 24
hours.
And they couldn't catch us,
honestly.
 PROBST: Yau-Man, what's the
downside, the disadvantage for
the favorites?
 Well, the fans have seen all
of us in action, so they know
everything about us.
They've gotten... you know, they
know exactly how we're going to
play, and we have no idea who
they are.
That's their advantage.
 PROBST: Which is why you're
sitting third out?
 Yes.
( laughter )
I'll take any excuse I can get.
( laughter )
 PROBST: Ami, you... the game
really shifted, it seemed like,
with you.
You were the first favorite to
go before a fan.
Did you feel it turn?
 Wait a second.
Fairplay went before me, and so
did Yau.
Hold on.
But yeah, I definitely felt a
turn, like, "Okay, this game is
completely shifting, and now
it's everybody for themself,"
and I was the first one to
realize that.
 PROBST: What's it like for
you doing this two times?
 It's been awesome.
I've been really doing a lot of
charity, and I'm bringing
together a lot of the survivors,
and we're going to be doing a
lot of charities together.
So... awesome
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Well, when it came to
the fan side of this idea, Erik
was exactly what we had in mind.
He knew the game.
He knew the players.
He was enthusiastic.
And he was star struck.
He was definitely a Survivor
fan.
 That's Jeff Probst!
He's just standing there!
 PROBST: Erik, you're a freak.
 I'm a huge fan of Survivor,
since the beginning, when the
first one, Borneo, came out.
 Couple more steps and you're
there.
Good job, Dude.
Erik, he's like a wide-eyed kid
in a candy store.
 Oh, baby.
 Oh, that is sad.
Something's wrong with that boy.
 I want to give individual
immunity to Natalie.
 You officially go down as the
dumbest survivor ever.
 PROBST: Erik, the tribe has
spoken.
( cheering and applause )
So, Erik, what was your initial
reaction when you found out you
were going to be on the show?
Because you've been watching...
I think we said during the
season, you've been watching
since you're 14.
 Yeah, I lost it.
I mean, this is crazy.
This is freaking crazy.
Right now I'm in... I haven't
ever left my small town.
I live in Pinckney, Michigan.
It's the middle of nowhere,
pretty much.
And I never thought in a million
years... I know how many people
apply for the show.
I know how many people are crazy
about this show.
And I didn't think I had a
chance to be on.
And then someone calls me up and
says, "Hey, you're freaking
hilarious.
We want to talk to you.
We want to see you."
I was ecstatic.
I mean, I can't...
 PROBST: What's the reaction
been in your hometown?
 It's been awesome.
I mean, everybody knows me
because I have this big, dumb
hair on my head.
And they see me, and they're
running up to me.
They're like, "I love you on
that show.
You're so funny."
Whatever.
And I'm like... it's crazy.
I've never done this before.
I've never experienced something
like that.
 PROBST: The tribal council
where you gave up your immunity,
I said at the end that's what
you call a life lesson.
Would you agree?
Was that a life lesson for you?
 I would totally agree with
that.
I mean, it taught me a lot of
different things, looking down
the line, looking around.
( laughter )
At first... I mean, when it
happened, at first I was like,
"Oh, my God, you're dumb.
You're real dumb."
But when you think about it, I
mean, the end game is pretty
crazy, and I didn't expect the
social part of this game.
I didn't expect to make friends
with these people, and I never
treated people in that way
before, in the way that this
game demands, in the way that
you need to use people like
pieces to help you move further.
And I saw everybody here as a
friend instead of a competitor,
instead of an enemy.
 PROBST: So now that you've
seen it all play out and you've
had time to think about it,
regret that move?
 Initially, yeah, that was
real dumb.
That was way dumb, like off-the-
charts dumb.
But when I see what you had to
do to make it further, there's
part of me that says I'm not
that guy.
I don't think I can do that.
I mean, I don't have that within
my being to treat people the way
that needs to be treated to win
this game.
I mean, certain morals come into
play with that.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: James, I want to get
you involved on something now
that involves... that involves
Erik and Jason and Ozzy.
We had three... within a few
weeks, three of the craziest
moves we've ever seen.
Of the three, since you are
somewhat of an expert on dumb
moves...
 Aw!
 Aw, James.
 PROBST: Is that not fair?
 Yes, sir.
 PROBST: Of Jason, Ozzy, and
Erik, who made the dumbest move?
 You know, Jason and Ozzy were
kind of blindsided.
I mean, that's part of the game.
It happens.
My good buddy here, Erik, I
mean, the girls were in the
boat.
They were cruising along.
He was on the side of the boat
with a life vest on.
He had it.
All he had to do was float
along.
He took the vest off, the life
vest off, and handed it to the
ones in the boat.
And I was like, "Wow!"
( applause )
Seriously!
Thank you.
You, boy.
( laughter )
 PROBST: All right, with that,
James, I think then... would the
audience agree with that?
( cheering and applause )
Okay.
Erik, we adore you, and you will
forever be a part of Survivor
history.
James, go ahead and take that
imaginary crown off your head
and just hand it to Erik.
( applause )
You're a good sport, Erik.
Up next, it was one of our
toughest seasons ever.
Three people were forced out of
the game.
We will hear from Jonathan,
Kathy, and James.
Plus, you know about one
Survivor love affair, but
there's another one that you
don't know about.
Taking us to our break, Survivor
composers Russ Landau and David
Vanacore.
 Come on, Erik!
 PROBST: Erik going back out
and takes a hard hit!
Oh!
Oh!
 Oh, my God!
 Oh!
 Ah!
 Oh!
 I want them to come and get a
boat and take me away.
 PROBST: Ami's hurt.
Penner has a busted up knee.
Parvati has a busted up lip.
An absolute wipeout for the
favorites.
 Infection that goes into your
bloodstream is potentially
fatal.
 Ah!
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: All right, let's get
some updates.
Penner, how's the leg?
 The leg is much better, still
a little sore.
I got nice honking scar.
But other than that, it's going
to be okay.
 PROBST: Why is this game so
hard?
 First I got to say hi to my
mom, who wound up in the
hospital today.
Sorry.
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.
I'm sorry you're watching from
there.
I love you.
Feel better.
( applause )
The game is hard... the hardest
thing, for me, about the game is
every day you're either getting
fired or you're firing somebody,
which is something that most
people go through once, twice,
three times in their life.
But every day you got to be
prepared, like, "I'm going to
fire your ass, or somebody is
going to look for me and get rid
of me."
It's betray or be betrayed.
It's tough, painful.
 PROBST: James, what's the
update on the finger?
 The finger is all right.
I had a lot of therapy and...
but yeah, a lot of antibiotics,
three times a day for seven
days.
It was kind of rough.
But it was cool.
 PROBST: Last time we did this
reunion show, we talked to you
about life at the cemetery, and
you told us about this
mother/daughter who came up in
the midst of grieving and how
you kind of turned their day
around.
Any similar stories happen since
that season?
 Yes, sir.
I mean...
( laughter )
My dad and I were working.
You know, we had a couple
funerals.
We were trying to get everything
squared away, and this lady was
walking outside.
And a few more people started
walking outside.
And the next thing you know,
there's, like, 50 people
standing there, and they're all
just looking at me.
( laughter )
And it's kind of... I don't
know.
It's a good thing, because I
like making people feel good.
So I'll pretty much do anything
to have somebody smile.
So this lady was, like, kind of
tearing up.
She said, "My mom loved your
abs."
( laughter )
"And it would be so nice if
you'd take off your shirt and,
you know, let me see your abs,
take a picture."
 I love your abs!
( laughter )
 Thank you.
So...
( cheering )
Yeah.
 PROBST: So you took off your
shirt and took a picture.
 Yeah, pretty much.
I had to take off my shirt, and
she's taking pictures, like,
smiling.
My dad's sitting there looking
at me like, "What's going on?"
And she's taken them.
She's so... she was so happy,
though.
 PROBST: James, always making
people happy.
( laughter and applause )
Speaking of your dad, we got a
chance to meet him on the show.
How is your dad taking all this?
 My dad is enjoying it.
 PROBST: There he is.
 He's having the best time
ever.
I mean, he's such... you know,
my dad's a sweetheart.
And they've been having blogs
about him, and he's been
checking up.
He's the man.
They think he's cute.
( laughter )
He's taking my role.
I mean, he can have it.
He's my dad.
( applause )
 PROBST: Now, Kathy, you had a
rough go out there.
You were... you were a huge fan.
You applied... people probably
don't know, you applied to the
show five times.
 And called the last two,
because those tapes are
expensive.
 PROBST: You finally get on.
Yeah, you finally get on, and
what happened?
What was going on out there?
 It just was an immediate
separation.
I mean, the people bringing us
in on the boats, I could tell
the natives were, you know,
backing away from me.
I'm like, "What?
Do I spell?"
I couldn't... you know.
It just was so isolating, and
you know, us three-- Chet,
Tracy, myself-- we were kind of
ostracized, and I couldn't
figure out why.
And it just got so hard.
And the weather and never being
dry and the rats crawling on you
and biting you and the bugs
biting you and the raw, giant
chewy clam lips that I swear to
God I never want to see again,
you know, it beat me down.
Mentally, I snapped.
Cuckoo.
 PROBST: Well, I got to say,
Kathy, that, you know, I've seen
people quit on this show that I
kind of felt like were quitting
just because they'd had enough.
I got to give you credit.
You endured a lot out there.
You were struggling for long
time.
 A long time.
 PROBST: You finally had
enough.
So I hope you're proud of how
you did.
I know you gave it your all.
 I did, I did.
Thank you.
( applause )
 PROBST: It wasn't tough for
everybody out there, though.
It was very clear from the start
that Ozzy and Amanda were
forming a different kind of
alliance.
 I've always thought Ozzy was
really, really cute.
So it's kind of like a couply
alliance.
Freaky?
 Amanda wrestle a four-foot
shark by herself.
I mean, that's pretty attractive
to a guy like me.
Amanda, I honestly feel like I
started to fall in love with
you.
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: So let's get an
update.
Ozzy, what's going on with this
love affair?
Is it still on?
 Well, I mean, Jeff, you know
how these Survivor girls are.
( laughter )
I...
( audience groaning )
And since... and since then,
it's been kind of tough, because
I've lost my job waiting tables.
I'm too popular, so I got to
clean the toilets now, and I
can't provide for her like I can
out on the island, so... you
know.
 He's joking, by the way.
 PROBST: Amanda, clear this up
for me.
Are you guys still together?
 Yeah, we're still together.
 PROBST: Yeah?
 Yes.
 PROBST: All right.
( cheering and applause )
 He's not cleaning toilets.
 PROBST: There's actually one
other love story.
I talked about the one we know
about, you guys, and we're glad
to hear you're together.
Mary, in the back row, another
Survivor love story.
Give us the lowdown.
 Yeah.
Well, it's been a good year.
I got to play Survivor, and I
fell in love.
I met Ryan from Survivor: Pearl
Islands thanks to Jonny after
the show wrapped.
And in December, we had our
first date, and three days
later, he asked me to marry him.
The rest is history.
( applause )
Baby, I love you!
 PROBST: Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: All right, up next,
we have one more love story.
Jonny Fairplay-- he met a model
and had a baby.
What?
Plus, somebody here is going to
pocket a lot of extra cash when
we come back.
Sprint is awarding $100,000 to
the Sprint player of the season.
Stay with us.
( applause )
( cheering and applause )
 PROBST: Well, since Thursday,
viewers have been texting in
their votes for the Sprint
player of the season.
This is the player that you guys
enjoyed following the most.
The votes are in, and I will
tell you the top three vote-
getters are...
Amanda.
( cheering and applause )
Ozzy.
( applause )
And James.
( cheering and applause )
One of you is about to win
$100,000 courtesy of Sprint.
The winner of the $100,000,
courtesy of Sprint, goes to
James.
( cheering and applause )
Back-to-back seasons.
Congratulations.
James, you're shaking your head
in disbelief.
It's all those people at the
cemetery you're making happy.
They're just paying you back,
man.
 Man, thank you all.
 PROBST: All right, I got to
check in with a few more people.
Congratulations, James.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Nice pocket change.
( cheering and applause )
Jonny Fairplay, up in the
corner, you know, I don't really
care to talk about you on
Survivor.
We invited you back, you did
what you did, boom, we're done.
What I am interested in is you
found love.
 Yeah.
I'm one of the luckiest guys on
the planet.
I got my fiancée, Michelle
Deighton from America's Next
Top Model.
And I have the...
 PROBST: Look at that
beautiful baby.
( cheering and applause )
 I got the most perfect little
girl on the planet.
Her name is Piper Addison
Fairplay.
And it's incredible.
I mean, like, I got the hug from
you leaving tribal council.
If you gave Piper a hug for me,
that'd be pretty big in my book,
Jeff, so...
 PROBST: Well, Fairplay, we're
very happy for you.
It's nice to see you can create
something so beautiful.
It really is.
We wish you well.
( applause )
Well, one of my favorite
Survivor couples ever, I got to
say, is Joel and Chet.
( applause )
And they teamed up for a classic
Survivor moment that we got to
take a look at one more time.
 PROBST: That's it.
( cheering and applause )
So, Joel, you were responsible,
yourself, Joel, for a couple of
blindsides.
 What are you talking about?
 PROBST: Then you get
blindsided.
What I want to know is which is
tougher to go back to the guys
in the firehouse, the fact that
you got blindsided or the fact
that Chet lasted longer than
you?
( cheering and applause )
 I... it's a very good edit.
I'll say that.
 PROBST: Well, the edit speaks
for itself.
Chet is two people to your left.
( laughter )
Did you have a good time on the
show?
 I had a good time on the
show.
Yeah, I haven't had any issues
with any of the guys at the
firehouse.
That's their favorite scene too.
 PROBST: Yeah.
( laughter )
No, it's great.
And, Chet, I have to say, with
all due respect to you, I gave
you a hard time out there.
 You did, you did.
 PROBST: I did.
And yet you outlasted a lot of
people in this game.
 I did.
Well, I mean, every tribal
council I was at-- and lord
knows I was at a lot of them-- I
mean, you really drilled into me
that I was probably the oldest
person there.
I was always the weakest person
there.
 PROBST: I said that.
 And you always praised the
athletic agility/strength
people, and I outlasted them.
So maybe when it comes right
down to it, maybe the whole
secret is just reading the
little Survivor manual just a
little bit closer than everybody
did.
 PROBST: Well said.
 Thank you.
 PROBST: Tracy, underrated in
this game, I think, and I heard
that from a lot of people who
watched the show.
You got off to a bad start, just
the way the numbers fell in the
group.
What advice would you give to
somebody who plays this game
that finds themself in a similar
situation?
Is there anything you could have
done differently?
 I'd like to say no.
I think I tried everything I
could possibly try.
I begged.
I mean, I pleaded with Cirie
till the last breath.
She wouldn't budge, but...
 PROBST: So sometimes, if you
get off to a bad start...
 Yeah.
I mean, well, you know, the
thing about Survivor is when you
elect to go on this... you know,
this adventure, you own it.
And so you got to own it.
And as bad as you don't like it,
you got to own it, and you can't
complain about what could have
been better for you.
It's changing, and you got to
suck it up and take it, so...
 PROBST: Nicely said.
Mikey B., I saved you for last
because I know that this being
Mother's Day and that one of the
things you wanted was to have
your mom here with you, because
she was so proud that you were
on the show, she isn't here with
us tonight.
Tell us what happened and tell
us how you're doing.
 Um, she basically got sick
right around the time where I
was leaving, and I didn't know
how severe it was because she
didn't want me to worry about
her when I was on the island.
But she passed away last month.
And you know, she's... she's
still here in spirit, and you
know, she always taught us that
God has a perfect plan and that
that plan never fails and to
celebrate death and move on.
And I believe she's here.
Her sisters are here
representing her, and I think
she's watching over us.
( applause )
And happy Mother's Day, Mama.
I love you.
 PROBST: And we want to wish
all of the moms out there a
happy Mother's Day, including
our own Audrey Roche, a part of
our Survivor family who couldn't
be here tonight.
Up next, we're going to show you
where Survivor is going next.
We'll be right back.
 PROBST: Welcome back.
Well, Survivor 17 is just around
the corner.
Where are we heading?
Here's an exclusive look at our
next location.
Every day, millions of Americans
go about their familiar routines
with friends and family in safe
surroundings.
But this fall, 18 of them will
be thrust into a land beyond
their wildest imagination.
This is Gabon, Earth's last
Eden.
Located in equatorial Africa,
Gabon is one of the world's last
remaining sanctuaries for pure,
untouched wilderness.
The culture of Gabon reflects
the beauty of this ancient land,
with rituals and dances as pure
today as they were generations
ago.
Gabon is the only place on the
planet where surfing hippos ride
the waves and elephants roam
with gorillas as leopards keep
watch.
18 Americans will be caught in
the midst of nature's fierce
battle for survival as they live
among some of the world's most
dangerous animals.
And for the first time, the
entire story will be shot in HD.
Join us this fall for Survivor:
Gabon: "Earth's Last Eden."
Tomorrow morning, Parvati will
appear on The Early Show on CBS
and will receive her check for
$1 million.
Immediately following tonight's
show, you can bid on one-of-a-
kind memorabilia to benefit the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation.
The Web site is on the screen
now.
Finally, if you have what it
takes to be on Survivor, go to
apply.
We will see you back for the
next Survivor, Gabon.
Good night.
