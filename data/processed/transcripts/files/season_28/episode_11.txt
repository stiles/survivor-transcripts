         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": NINTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
IN ORDER TO GET RID OF L.J.,
TONE HETO BLINDSIDE HIS OWN
ALLIANCE.
 NOW, ME, TRISH, AND KASS,
TALK ABOUT FEELING ON THE
BOTTOM.
 Jeff: AT THE NEXT TRIBAL








COUNCIL-- JEREMIAH THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN IT'S ALLIANCE OF FIVE
REGROUPED TO TAKE OUT JEREMIAH,
LEAVING TASHA AND SPENCER ON THE
BOTTOM.
 TASHA AND I ARE UP AGAINST
THIS GOLIATH ARMY OF FIVE.
 Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, TONY
DUG UP HIS SECOND HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO IDOLS.
 Jeff: WHILE SPENCER DUG UP
A PLAN TO TRICK TONY AND SAVE
HIMSELF.








 JEFRA SAYING SHE WANTED TO
VOTE YOU OUT, THAT WASN'T A LIE.
IF YOU CAN MAKE TONY PARANOID
ABOUT AN ALL-GIRLS' ALLIANCE,
THAT'S GOLD.
 Jeff: AND IT WORKED.
 WE GETTA GET RID OF A GIRL
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: TONY PULLED IN WOO.
 SPENCER PULLED IN TASHA.
 Jeff: AND TOGETHER THEY
PULLED OFF ANOTHER BLINDSIDE.
JEFRA.
LEAVING TONY'S ALLIANCE IN THE
DARK ONCE AGAIN.
JEFRA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN
SUPERPOWER SIX ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 THAT WAS INTENSE.
 THE PATTERN CONCERNS.
 I'M PISSED OFF.
ANOTHER BLINDSIDE.
JEFRA TAKEN OUT FOR CROSSING THE
DON-- AKA, TONY, OUR MAFIA KING.
ANYONE WHO CROSSES TONY GETS
THEIR CEMENT SHOES AND THROWN IN
THE POND.
 DO YOU AND TRISH WANT AN
EXPLANATION FOR WHY?
 NO, TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY?
 WHY DID I DO IT?
 BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO
BLINDSIDE AND YOU US--
 I'M GLAD NEWER NOT A JEFRA
AND I NEED TO SIT THERE FOR FIVE
HOURS.
 I FEEL LIKE THEY DIDN'T LEARN
THE LESSON FROM WHEN I FLIPPED
FROM MY OTHER ALLIANCE WHICH IS
DON'T LEAVE SOMEONE ELSE.
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.
FOOL ME TRICE, SHAME ON ME.
I DON'T LIKE BEING THE ONE
SLACK-JAWED AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
AND THAT'S NOW HAPPENED TWICE.
I KNEW JEFF RAFS GOING TO BE ON
THE OUTS AND I KNOW WHAT A HOT
HEAD YOU ARE IF SOMEONE DOES
THAT.
 IT WASN'T A HOT HEAD.
SHE WANTED TO BLINDSIDE ME.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HOME HAD SHE
WENT WITH SPENCER AND THEM.
 SO DOES TASHA AND SPENCER
WANT TO GET RID OF YOU, OPENLY.
 I KNOW THAT.
THEY NEVER PROMISED ON THEIR
MOTHERS, ON THEIR FATHERS
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY WITH ME.
WHEN I MAKE A PROMISE LIKE THAT
TO SOMEBODY I KEEP IT UNTIL THEY
TRY TO STAB ME IN THE BACK
FIRST.
 TONY, I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING
PROUD OF YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, BUT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACT LIKE THAT.
 ANOTHER KASS.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GETTING REALLY OLD HERE,
TONY.
THE WAY YOU TALK TO PEOPLE.
I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE
SO CONDESCENDING.
 I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
CONDESCENDING BECAUSE THERE'S NO
WAY--
 RIGHT NOW, TONY.
 YEAH.
 YOU'RE KIND OF BEING A JERK.
 OKAY, KASS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
 I WONDER WITH TONY FOR THE
LAST BLINDSIDE OF JEFRA AND IT
REALLY WAS A ONE-TIME DEAL BUT
NOW THE DYNAMIC HAS CHANGED.
NOW WE HAVE KASS AND TONY
FIGHTING LIKE CATS AND DOGS AND
THAT'S GREAT FOR TASHA AND I.
 I'M SORRY IF YOU FELT I WAS
BEING CONDESCENDING BECAUSE THAT
WAS FAR FROM MY INTENTION SO I
APOLOGIZE.
 GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING
STICKING WITH THIS PERSON?
IT'S STUPID.
PLAY YOUR GAME.
 AND WILL PLAY MY GAME BECAUSE
I'M DONE WITH HIM.
 YEAH, THREE DIFFERENT
OCCASIONS.
 JUST SHADOWING YOU ONE DAY
WOULD BE INTENSE.
 HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU GET
LEGITIMATELY NERVOUS JAI NEVER
GET NERVOUS.
 NEVER?
 THEY SHOT AT ME.
BUT YOU DON'T GET NERVOUS.
IT'S FUN.
IT'S ADRENALINE, MAN.
 YOU'RE SCREWED UP.
I'M GETTING TO KNOW TONY MORE
AND I LIKE HIM, BUT I STILL
THINK TONY IS LYING TO EVERYONE
ALL THE TIME OUT HERE.
AND HE'S GOOD AT IT.
GOING FORWARD, IT'S TOUGH TO
WORK WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S SLY.
HE'S PLAYING HARDER THAN ANYONE.
AND HE'S VERY, VERY DANGEROUS.
SO I USUALLY SLEEP THIS LE?
 YEAH.
 WOW.
 I'M SURPRISED AT KASS.
KASS IS USUALLY UP.
 NOT GETTING UP AND LAYING IN
BED IS PRETTY SMART.
 UH-HUH.
 SHOWS ME WHAT TONE SEREALLY
THINKING ABOUT ME.
 YOUR SKILL AS A COP COME IN
HANDY.
, OF COURSE.
DECEPTION, MAN.
EVERYBODY YOU DEAL WITH IS
TRYING TO DECEIVE YOU.
 TRISH RYOU WEAK?
HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO THE
BOYS?
 AND WE HAVE A GOOD SLOGAN,
BELIEVE NOTHING YOU HEAR AND
ONLY HALF OF WHAT YOU SEE.
 HE'S OVER THERE CONTINGENT
THE BOYS THAT I'M A BITCH.
 DID HE SAY YOU'RE A BITCH?
 YEAH AND THAT HE WOULD GET ME
OUT.
 DOES HE NOT KNOW YOU ARE
RIGHT HERE?
 HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ASLEEP.
 APPARENTLY HE'S GETTING WORSE
EVERY DAY.
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP
TODAY SO I DECIDED TO JUST LAY
THERE AND LISTEN AND I HEARD MY
NAME OUT OF TONE'S MOUTH.
AND I HEARD TONY SAY, "KASS IS
SUCH A BITCH, DID YOU HEAR HER
LAST NIGHT?"
HE MADE ME HATE HIM MORE.
 KASS, YOU DIDN'T WAKE UP THIS
MORNING.
 I DID, I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU
SAID ABOUT ME.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
 I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.
I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID
ABOUT ME.
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WHAT I
EXPHRD SO DOES SPENCE AND WOO.
 AND ME?
 YOU GUYS WERE OVER THERE
TALKING.
YOU WEREN'T TALKING BUT YOU AND
SPENCER WERE.
 ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?
 I'M BEING SERIOUS.
 HONESTLY, WE DIDN'T TALK
ABOUT YOU.
 NOBODY DID EXCEPT TONY.
 NO WAY, NO HOW.
 KASS LEGITIMATELY MISHEARD
TONY.
SO NOW TONY IS ACTUALLY TELLING
THE TRUTH, WHICH IS RARE.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SPECIAL
MOMENT, AND KASS DOESN'T BELIEVE
IT.
AM I GOING TO CLEAR UP THE
SITUATION?
NO!
 YOU'RE SO OFF.
SO OFF.
 TONY WASN'T DOING ANYTHING
WRONG BUT IF KASS IS MAD AT
TONY, THAT MEANS SHE ISN'T MAD
AT ME AND I'M SITTING BACK
ENJOYING THE SHOW.
 I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YOU AT
ALL.
I MEAN, I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN MY MIND.
YOU ARE ALWAYS IN MY THOUGHTS,
BUT I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
FOR SOME REASON, KASS SAYS, "I
HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT ME."
AND I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID,
"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT YOU?"
SHE'S OFF HER ROCKER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH
HER AND I DON'T CARE.
JUST KEEP ON VOTING.
LET ME TAKE HER TO THE END WITH
ME SO I CAN WIN THE VOTES.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COP THINGS
AND NOTHING ABOUT YOU.
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU, IT
IS NOTHING ABOUT YOU.
 TONY MOVED UP A LEVEL AS A
PLAYER BY MAKING TWO BIG MOVES--
BLINDSIDING L.J. AND BLINDSIDING
JEFRA AND USING PEOPLE OUTSIDE
HIS ALLIANCE TO DO THAT AND NOT
LETTING PEOPLE IN THE ALLIANCE
IN.
NOW IT'S PUT A RED FLAG OUT
THERE THAT TONY IS WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WENT WITH HIM
ARE JUST CULT MEMBERS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A CULT
MEMBER.
I WANT TO KILL THE CULT LEADER.
 I DON'T LIKE TENSION AROUND
CAMP.
KASS WAS MAD AT ME THINKING I
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HER AND I
SAID LET ME JUST SQUASH THIS AND
MOVE FORWARD ACCORDING TO PLAN
SO SHE DOESN'T GET ANY BRILLIANT
IDEAS TO TRY TO OUST ME.
KASS I WANTED TO TELL YOU REAL
QUICK, WERE YOU JOKING OR DID
YOU THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT
YOU?
 YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME.
I CONFIRMED IT WITH EVERYONE.
 THEY'RE LYING TO YOU, KASS.
 TONY, I KNOW WHAT I HEARD.
JUST STOP LYING TO ME.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING THIS BIG
DEAL OUT OF IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW
IT'S TRUE.
 I'M TELLING YOU IT WASN'T
TRUE, SO DON'T TELL ME WHAT I
SAID.
 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SAID.
 YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT I
SAID.
 I JUST TOLD YOU WHAT YOU
SAID.
LET'S HAVE A BIG ARGUMENT.
 I KNOW WHAT I SAID BUT YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HEARD.
 TONY, EVERYTHING THAT COMES
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS A LIE.
 I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YOU.
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.
 THIS IS A CLASSIC SIGN OF
SOMEONE WHO HAS GOTTEN TOO DEEP
INTO THEIR OWN LIES THEY DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ANYTHING.
 YOU MAKE NO SENSE.
 THEN DON'T TALK TO ME, TONY.
 YOU MAKE NO SENSE.
 TONY IS LOOSING IT.
TONY, I'M HAPPY HE'S IMPLODING.
I LIKE TO HAVE CHAOS AND I LIKE
TO HAVE TROUBLE.
I LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE AT THEIR
BREAKING POINT IN THIS GAME
BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUT THE WORST
IN THEM, AND I EXPECT THAT OF
HIM BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT.
 SHE HAS TO FLATTER HERSELF.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
I HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU
FOR.
 WELL, IF YOU CAN, JUST LET IT
GO.
 NO, I'M DONE.
I'M GOOD.
AND THEN SHE'S LOOKING AT ME
WITH THAT STUPID GRIN ON HER
FACE LIKE SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S
TALKING ABOUT.
A NUT JOB, MAN.
 KASS IS CONVINCED THAT SHE
HEARD TONY TALKING ABOUT HER.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
BUT YOU CAN'T CONVINCE HER THAT,
THAT EVENT DID NOT HAPPEN, BUT
IF THE TWO OF THEM ARE AT EACH
OTHER'S THROAT, THEN IT TAKES
THE TARGET OFF OF ME.
 HOW OLD ARE YOU, 40?
 YES.
 YOU ACT LIKE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.
 THAT'S WHY I'M COMB POSED AND
YOU'RE NOT.
 HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT TWO
MONTHS YOU'LL DO A LITTLE
GROWING BEFORE YOU HIT 40.
 OH, WOW, I'LL TAKE THAT
ADVICE FROM YOU.
 I'M NOT THE ONE HAVING A
TANTRUM.
 I'M NOT EITHER.
 I THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND AND
SELF-DESTRUCTING OUT HERE.
 I'LL NEVER SELF-DESTRUCT,
HONEY, NEVER HAPPEN.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE ME
OUT?
Y I THINK I WILL WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN.
 YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN,
YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME?
 THAT'S FINE, AS LONG AS WE
CLEARED THE AIR.
 MAKE SURE YOU PLAY YOUR IDOL.
 LISTEN, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO
PLAY.
YOU WRITE MY NAME DOWN YOU'RE
GOING HOME.
 PLAY YOUR IDOL.
 WRITE MY NAME DOWN.
 I WILL, TONY.
 AND YOU'LL GO HOME.
 BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING THE
SHOW.
 NO, BECAUSE I HAVE A SPECIAL
IDOL, THAT'S WHY.
 I'M SURE YOU DO.
 YOU GUYS HEAR THAT.
SPENCE, YOU HEAR WHAT I TOLD
HER?
 YOU HAVE A SPECIAL IDOL.
 AND YOU'LL GO HOME.
PUT MY NAME DOWN.
 SO SHOW IT TO US.
 I DON'T HAVE TO.
PUT MY NAME DOWN AND YOU'LL SEE
IT YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO SEE
IT.
 I DON'T GIVE MUCH CREDENCE TO
TONY'S CLAIM THAT HE HAS A
SPECIAL IDOL.
TONY IS KNOWN FOR LYING.
 I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF ONE
GUY.
 YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T.
 RIGHT THERE.
 YOU CAN'T.
 I CAN'T?
 YOU CAN'T.
 OKAY.
WE'LL SEE.
 WE WILL SEE.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 OKAY THERE, YOU GO.
YOU'RE DONE.
AND JUST LIKE THAT, TASH AND
SPENCER, YOU GUYS MOVE UP
ANOTHER NOTCH, HUH?
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?
 YES!
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS OF THREE.
ON MY GO, YOU'LL RAISE TO THROW
SANDBAGS UNTIL ONE TEAM
COMPLETELY DESTROYS THE OTHER
TEAM'S WALL.
THEN ONE MEMBER OF EACH TEAM
WILL RACE TO REBUILD THEIR WALL.
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES.
 YES!
 Jeff: THE WINNING TEAM WILL
BE TAKEN TO A LOCAL ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL WHERE YOU WILL SERVE AS
"SURVIVOR" AMBASSADORS OF GOOD
WILL.
YOU'LL BE BRINGING SCHOOL
SUPPLIES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL
STUDENT AND FOR THE SCHOOL AS A
WHOLE.
A LITTLE NOURISHMENT FOR THE
SOUL.
YOU'LL ALSO BE BRINGING WITH YOU
FOOD.
HAMBURGERS AND HOT DOGS.
 OH!
 Jeff: AMERICAN STYLE.
SHOULD BE A GREAT AFTERNOON.
WORTH PLAYING FOR.
 YES.
 YES.
 ABSOLUTELY!
 Jeff: WE'LL DRAW FOR TEAMS
AND GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
IT IS WOO, SPENCER, AND KASS
TAKING ON TASHA, TRISH, AND
TONY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
THE GOAL IS VERY SIMPLE-- YOU
WANT TO KNOCK DOWN THEIR WALL
BEFORE THEY DO YOURS.
THEN YOU WILL HAVE MORE PIECES
OF YOUR WALL INTACT WHEN IT
COMES TIME TO REBUILD.
TONE WEA NICE TOSS KNOCKS OFF A
COUPLE OF BLOCKS.
KASS COMES UP A LITTLE SHORT.
TONY WITH A HIES NIT.
SPENCER WITH A MASSIVE HIT.
KASS WITH ANOTHER.
ONCE ONE TRIBE DECIMATES THE
OTHER'S WALL, SWITCH IT UP, AND
START REBUILDING YOURS.
SPENCER TAKES OUT ANOTHER FOUR
BLOCKS.
 NICE!
 Jeff: TRISH WITH A NICE
HIT.
THIS THING IS HEATING UP.
FOUR BLOCKS LEFT FOR PURPLE, TWO
FOR ORANGE.
ORANGE IS DOWN TO ONE.
PURPLE DOWN TO TWO.
THERE IT IS!
KASS KNOCKS OFF THE LAST ORANGE
BLOCK.
SWITCH, START COLLECTING BLOCKS.
THE PURPLE PUZZLE HAS TWO
PIECES.
ORANGE HAS NONE.
NOT MUCH OF A LEAD.
WE NOW HAVE OUR TWO PUZZLE
MAKERS, SPENCER BUILDING FOR HIS
TEAM, TASHA BUILDING FOR HERS.
SPENCER HAS TWO PLOKS BUT IT
REALLY DOES HIM NO GOOD BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT IN ANY ORDER.
 BEAUTIFUL.
 TWO FORMER MEMBERS OF THE
BRAIN TRIBE IN A SHOWDOWN ON A
PUZZLE.
 YOU SEE THE TEETH IN THE
CORNERRERS.
 I'M LOOKING FOR THE BASE
RIGHT NOW.

 Jeff: SPENCER FALLING
BEHIND.
TASHA STARTING TO PULL AWAY FROM
SPENCER.
 DO YOU SEE THE MIDDLE BOTTOM
PIECE HERE?
 YOU HAVE IT UP THERE, IT'S
ALREADY THERE.
 Jeff: A LOT OF PANIC
SETTING IN ALREADY.
THIS IS STARTING TO BECOME A
RUNAWAY.
THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU PLACING
THEM IN THE RIGHT SPOT?
 FLIP IT OVER AND PUT IT ON
THAT CORNER.
KASS NOW STARTING TO GUIDE
SPENCER.
ONE DAY YOU'RE ARGUING WITH
SOMEBODY.
THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE RELYING ON
THEM.
 FLIP IT AROUND.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: SPENCER FINALLY
STARTING TO GET SOME MOMENTUM.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE
QUICKLY IN ORDER TO CATCH TASHA.
 PERFECT.
 Jeff: TASHA WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.
 SPENCER AND KASS REALLY WORK
TOGETHER WELL.
 HELP ME, GUYS.
 Jeff: TASHA NOW STRUGGLING
A BIG BIT.
 PUT IT TO THE RIGHT, PERFECT.
 Jeff: SPENCER CONTINUING TO
GAIN ON TASHA NOW.
 ALL RIGHT, TASH.
 YES.
 Jeff: TASHA STILL CAN'T
FIND THAT MISSING PIECE.
SPENCE WER ANOTHER PIECE.
TIGHTENING THE GAP NOW.
 DON'T PANIC.
 Jeff: TASHA STARTING TO
PANIC.
SHE CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE NOW.
THIS IS HOW FAST A CHALLENGE CAN
CHANGE.
SPENCER AND KASS HAVE BROUGHT
THEIR TEAM BACK INTO THIS.
MOMENTUM HAS COMPLETELY SHIFTED.
THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER GIVE UP.
 SLOW DOWN.
 Jeff: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
COMEBACK.
SPENCER KASS, AND WOO WIN
REWARD? RE.
 YES!
 GOD, I WANTED THAT ONE SO
BAD.
 Jeff: SPENCER, KASS, WOO,
NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING TO FILL
YOUR BELLIES WITH FOOD.
MORE THAN THAT, YOU'RE CHANGING
LIVES.
YOU'RE REPRESENTING "SURVIVOR"
AND BRINGING SUPPLIES TO KIDS
WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE
THEM.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, AND
HAVE A GREAT AFTERNOON.
TASHA, TRISH, TONY, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
TODAYS REWARD WAS A
PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE
BACK TO THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY
AND TO BE AN AMBASSADOR FOR
"SURVIVOR QAND THE THE MOMENT WE
COME OUT IS MOB DEEP OF ALL
THESE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PEOPLE.
IT WAS PHENOMENAL YES, BOOK
BAGS.
YOU NEED A BOOK BAG.
THIS ONE'S COOL.
THERE YOU GO.
 HOW ABOUT A CRAZY ONE!
 TO SEE HOW STOKED THEY WERE
TO RECEIVE BOOK BAGS WAS
SOMETHING VERY HUMBLING THAT I
WILL JUST POSSESS IN MY HEART
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
YEAH!
 HERE, BUD.
 WHO LIKES THE BASKETBALL?
WOOOO!
YES!
YES!
 I'M NOT REALLY A KID PERSON,
AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY
THAT I DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE
KIDS.
 THERE YOU ARE!
THERE YOU GO.
YOU SHARE, OKAY?
 IT WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING
HAVING ALL OF THESE LITTLE
MONSTERS SWARMING ME.
 LET'S LET SOME OF THE OTHER
KIDS UP.
 ONCE I GOT INTO IT, I DID
ENJOY IT?
YOU WANT IT?
AND IT KIND OF SURPRISED ME IN A
GOOD WAY THAT IT WAS SUCH A
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
 YOU GUYS LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE
MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION?
 YEAH!
 I NEED ONE VOLUNTEER.
SPENCER, PLEASE.
 ALL RIGHT!
 BEAT ME UP.
 SPENCER, I'LL JUST HAVE YOU
HOLD THIS.
I PROMISE YOU, I WILL NOT KICK
YOU.
THIS IS CALLED THE TURNING HOOK
KICK, BUT BEFORE I DO IT...
( APPLAUSE )
 I LOVED WOO DOING HIS MARTIAL
ARTS AND BEING AN ENTERTAINER.
DEFINITELY IN HIS ELEMENT.
WOO IS USUALLY QUIET.
THIS IS THE MOST HE'S SPOKE NEN
31 DAYS IS TO, YOU KNOW, 100
KIDS.
 YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE
BALL FROM ME?
OH!
( APPLAUSE )
GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB!
 I REALLY LIKE WOO A LOT MORE
AFTER SEEING HOW HE WAS WITH THE
KIDS.
 BYE-BYE, EVERYONE, STUDY
HARD.
 BYE!
 I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE
GAME FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF
HOURS, BUT THE KIDS HAVE TO GO
BACK TO CLASS AND WE NEED TO GO
BACK TO "SURVIVOR 101" AND I'M
HERE WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO COULD
BE ALLIES.
CONSIDERING WHAT HAPPENED LAST
NIGHT AT TRIBAL I NEED SOME NEW
ALLIES.
 DID YOU SEE HOW SMOKED THOSE
KIDS WERE, IT WAS AWESOME.
 IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOUR
PERSONALITY, WOO.
YOU'RE SO QUIET AT CAMP.
I WAS PLEASED IT'S US THREE THAT
CAME.
THIS IS WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO
DO.
WE NEED TO FLUSH THE IDOL.
IF TONEY AND TRISH TELL ME
THEY'RE VOTING FOR TASH, TWO
VOTE TRISH, TWO VOTE TONY.
 IF HE DOESN'T PLAY THE'S OUT
WITH THE IDOL.
IF HE DOES, WE VOTE FOR TRISH.
 I SPOKE WITH SPENCER AND WOO
ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER TO DO A
THREE-WAY SPLIT AGAINST TONY.
SPENCER AND I HAD A LOT OF
ANIMOSITY IN THE PAST BUT NOW WE
HAVE A COMMON ENEMY.
I'M NO LONGER THE ENEMY.
TONY IS THE NEW ENEMY.
WHAT DO I SAY PONDS PEOPLE WELL?
HATRED AND ENEMIES.
 TASH WILL BE WITH THIS.
THIS IS WHAT TASH AND I HAVE
WANTED.
 YOU WON'T TELL TONY THIS?
 NO, I WANT TONY OUT.
 KASS HAS MANAGED TO SCREW UP
MY GAME IN THE PAST.
BUT RIGHT NOW, IF TONY GOES WITH
TWOIZEOLS HE GOES FROM A THREAT
TO THE BIGGEST THREAT.
 YOU WANT TO GET TONY OUT
BEFORE TALK?
 YES, WE HAVE TO FLUSH THAT
IDOL.
THERE'S ONLY ONE TIME TO FLUSH
THE IDOL.
THE LAST TIME HE CAN USE IT IS
AT FIVE.
WE'RE THREE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE
FINAL THREE.
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF
DECISIONS.
 RIGHT.
 HONESTLY, WOO, I WOULD BE
HAPPY WITH GOING YOU TO THE END.
KASS, TOO.
I THINK I WOULD BE REALLY
HAPPY--
 US THREE.
 WITH US THREE BEING THE FINAL
THREE?
 I THINK IT'S A FAIR THREE,
WHERE THERE'S NO LANDSLIDE.
 YEAH.
YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO
MAKE A MOVE.
 HONESTLY, WORKING WITH WOO IS
STRESSFUL BECAUSE ALL I'M
GETTING FROM WOO IS, "YEAH.
YEAH.
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.
RIGHT."
 YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU WOULD ENTERTAIN?
 YOU CAN BE STRAIGHT UP WITH
US, YOU KNOW.
 NO, I'LL DEFINITELY CONSIDER
IT.
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, IT'S
GOING TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL GAME.
AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE LOOKING
OUT FOR OURSELVES.
 DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
 PLAYING THIS GAME FROM DAY
ONE WITH TONY, IT'S HARD TO DP
AGAINST HIM.
 LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
 BUT THIS GAME, IT'S DOING
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MOVE YOURSELF
FORWARD.
SO IF THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO
MAKE A BIG MOVE, TAKE TONY OUT,
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'LL
DEFINITELY CONSIDER.
 SO AS FAR AS STRATEGY, I CAN
TALK TO TASHA ABOUT WHAT WE
DISCUSSED.
 OKAY, PERFECT.
 OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL
YOU DECIDE FOR SURE, WOO?
 YEAH.
 I'M IN.
 YOU'RE IN?
 I'M IN.
 AWESOME.
I THINK WOO IS MAYBE GETTING IN
GAME MODE.
WALKING BACK FROM THE REWARD, HE
JUST SAID, "I'M ON BOARD."
AND I LIKE THAT HE TOOK THAT
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
IT SHOWS ME HE'S JUST NOT
KNEEJERKING THIS GAME.
 I'M NOT GOING TO DISCLOSE
ANYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED, NO
WAY.
 NO,.
 WE'RE ALL GOING TO TRUST EACH
OTHER.
 BUT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
 HEY, GUYS!
HOW WAS IT?
 GOOD.
EPIC, MAN.
THE KIDS LOVING US.
 WOO WAS AN ENTERTAIN.
WOO WAS, LIKE, MAKING ALL THESE
KIDS LAUGH.
HE WAS ENTERTAINING HUNDREDS OF
KIDS.
 I WOULD BE LIKE,"GET OUT OF
THE WAY.
I WANT TO EAT SM OF.
 IT WAS A COOL EXPERIENCE.
 SO KASS REALIZES THAT TONY
NEEDS TO GO, SO WE WERE THINKING
THE BRAINS PLUS WOO, YOU, ME,
KASS, WOO.
WE REALLY CAN'T LOSE IF WE TEAM
UP.
BECAUSE WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTES
BETWEEN TONY AND TRISH.
AND IF TONY PLAYS THE IDOL, WE
SEND HOME TRISH.
AND THEN WE SEND HOME TONY NEXT
WEEK.
 DO YOU TOTALLY TRUST WOO?
 HOPEFULLY HE'S WITH US,
BECAUSE IF HE ISN'T, TONY NOW
KNOWS EVERYTHING.
 YES.
 TONY RESIDENT PEOPLE REALLY
WELL.
IT'S VERY HARD TO LIE TO HIM.
 I WONDER IF THEY GOT WOO.
TO BLINDSIDE US.
 I'LL FIND OUT.
I'LL SAY, "WOO, ANY STRATEGY
TALK?
WHAT'S GOING ON.
FILL ME IN."
 IF HE SAYS NO--
 , OF COURSE,.
 THEN HE'S LYING.
AND WE KNOW WE'RE SCREWED.
 WHAT'S UP, KARATE KID?
 OH, MAN.
 ANY STRATEGY TALK?
 YEAH.
 WHO WAS TALKING?
 KASS AND SPENCER ARE SAYING
WE SHOULD TAKE OUT TASHA.
 THAT'S THEIR STRATEGY TALK?
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE SPENCER?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 SO WHAT'S KASS TELL YOU?
 TAKE OUT TASHA.
 THAT'S WHAT SHE'S TELLING
YOU.
 YEAH.
 OH.
ANY CLUES OR ANYTHING.
WAS SPENCER SAYING ANYTHING?
 NO.
 OKAY, SHHH!
UP TO THIS POINT NOW, WOO HAS
BEEN A DISCIPLINED ALLY.
SO I HAVE NO REASON NOT TO TRUST
HIM YOU KNOW.
SPENCER DIDN'T MENTION NOTHING
ABOUT ME?
 NO.
 NOTHING ABOUT MY IDOL.
 NO.
 WOW.
I WAS THINKING HE WAS GOING TO
COME UP TO YOU AND SAY, "LISTEN,
IT'S TIME TO MAKE A WOO.
COME WITH ME, AND TASHA."
HE DIDN'T PROPOSE THAT.
 NO.
 NOTHING LIKE THAT?
 THAT DON'T SOUND RIGHT.
 WOO WAS TELLING ME OH, YES,
SPENCER WANTED TO VOTE OFF TASH.
IT DIDN'T MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL.
TO GET RID OF ONE NUMBER LOCKED
IN HIS HAND MAKES NO SENSE.
AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, OKAY,
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
AND WOO MIGHT THINK OF MAKING A
POWER MOVE RIGHT NOW.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT
WOO ALL ALONG.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: TASHA FOR THE THIRD
TIME IN A ROW, I WILL TAKE IT
BACK.
YOU ARE ONE VICTORY AWAY FROM
TYING KELLY WIGGLESWORTH AS A
RECORD FOR FOUR WINS IN A ROW.
 YOU GO, SISTER.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE OUT AND COUNT THE
NUMBER OF ITEMS AT SIX DIFFERENT
STATIONS.
YOU WILL USE THOSE NUMBERS TO
SOLVE A COMBINATION LOCK.
IF YOU PULL ON THE LOCK AND IT'S
WRONG, YOU HAVE TO HEAD BACK OUT
AND COUNT AGAIN.
FIRST PERSON TO SOLVE THEIR
COMBINATION, BREAK THE TILE,
WINS IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE
IN FIVE SHOT AT WINNING THIS
GAME.
LOSERS, YOU KNOW THE DRILL--
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AFTER 33 DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL BE
VOTED OUT.
DRAW FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
SIX STATIONS.
TRY TO REMEMBER AS MEMBERSHIP
NUMBERS AS YOU CAN.
THEN HEAD BACK AND LOCK THEM IN
ON YOUR COMBINATION LOCK.
THIS IS GOING TO TEST YOU
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY JUST
REMEMBERING NUMBERS AFTER 33
DAYS IS A LOT.
THEN HAVING TO SPRINT BACK AND
FORTH.
TONY'S FIRST BACK.
TASHA RIGHT BEHIND.
HERE'S SPENCER.
LOCK THEM IN, AND THEN HEAD BACK
OUT AND COUNT SOME MORE.
WOO COMING BACK WITH A BIG OLD
SMILE ON HIS FACE.
HERE'S TRISH.
THE QUESTION SHOW MANY NUMBERS
CAN YOU REMEMBER AT ONCE?
COULD SOMEBODY DO ALL SIX
STATIONS?
SPENCER HEADING BACK OUT.
TASHA HEADING BACK OUT.
WOO HEADING BACK OUT.
TRISH HEADING BACK OUT.
HERE COMES KASS.
KASS HAS BEEN OUT THERE FOR A
LONG TIME.
THE QUESTION IS, DOES SHE HAVE
ALL SIX NUMBERS AND ARE THEY
RIGHT?
TONY HEADING BACK AGAIN.
HERE COMES TASHA AND SPENCER.
SPENCER FLYING.
KASS GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT.
SHE'S WRONG.
YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT.
YOU HAVE TO HEAD BACK OUT.
SPENCER BACK, TASHA BACK, TONY'S
BACK.
WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT NOW
WHERE SOMEBODY COULD HAVE
COUNTED ALL SIX STATIONS AND
THEY COULD BE RIGHT.
TONY GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT.
HE'S WRONG, GOING TO HEAD BACK
OUT.
 ALL RIGHT, JEFF.
 Jeff: SPENCER GOING FOR IT.
HE'S WRONG.
 JEFF?
 Jeff: TASHA WRONG.
HEAD BACK OIT.
YOU HAVE TO GO.
WOO STILL SMILING.
DOES HE HAVE IT, IS THE
QUESTION.
I'M GOING TO TRY.
HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
NO, WOO HAS TO GO BACK OUT.
HERE COMES TRISH.
BIG EFFORT BY A WOMAN WHO CAN
BARELY MOVE, HAS NO MUSCLE LEFT
ON HER BODY, WOULD BE A HUGE
VICTORY FOR TRISH.
TRISH IS WRONG.
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS TRICKY.
WHICH NUMBER IS WRONG?
DO I HAVE MORE THAN ONE WRONG?
IT LOOKS SO SIMPLE.
COUNT THE NUMBER OF ITEMS.
SPENCER TRIES.
HE'S WRONG.
WOO IS GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
AND HE'S WRONG.
WOO HAS TO HEAD BACK OUT.
TRISH TRIES IT, SHE IS WRONG.
TASHA WRONG, HEAD BACK OUT.
KASS IT WRONG AGAIN.
FRUSTRATION SETTING IN FOR
EVERYBODY.
 OH, COME ON!
 Jeff: KEEP FIGHTING YOU
GUYS.
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO WIN THIS!
 Jeff: HERE COMES TASHA.
SHE RECOUNTED EVERY SINGLE
STATION, DOUBLE CHECKING HER
WORK.
HERE COMES KASS.
HERE COMES TONY.
IT IS A SPRINT TO THE END.
DOES SOMEBODY HAVE IT?
KASS IS WRONG.
WHO'S GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT?
HERE COMES SPENCER.
HERE COMES TRISH.
TONY'S WRONG.
THIS COULD BE TASHA'S FOURTH
IMMUNITY IN A ROW IF SHE'S
RIGHT.
NO!
SPENCER HAS IT!
SPENCER WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY!
SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
HUGE EFFORT BY EVERYBODY.
TASHA, YOU WERE ONE OFF BAMBOO
FOR A LONG TIME.
SPENCER, COME ON OVER.
BIG EFFORT.
BIG DAY.
BIG WIN.
SPENCER, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
BUT AFTER 33 DAYS, SOMEBODY,
SADLY, GOING HOME TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
EVERYONE WAS IN THAT
 YES.
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME, EVERY
SINGLE CHALLENGE UP TO THIS
POINT.
 THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.
NO ONE BELIEVED ME.
 THE SAME TWO PEOPLE KEEP
WINNING.
WHY TONIGHT YOU SHARE THE
WEALTH?
 I'M SO BUMMED I DIDN'T WIN
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
GOOD FOR YOU, I'M GLAD, SPENCE.
 GOOD FOR YOU, BRO.
 I'M NOT DONE YET.
THERE'S STILL HAVOC TO WREAK.
 NEITHER TONY NOR TRISH WON,
SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPLIT THE
VOTE?
 DO YOU WANT TO DO BOYS TONY,
GIRLS TRISH?
 THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
 BOYS TONY.
 SO YOU AND I VOTE TONY, AND
TASHA AND KASS VOTE TRISH?
IF HE DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL,
IT'S TONY.
IF HE DOES, IT'S TRISH.
WE CAN'T LOSE.
I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE SPECIAL
IDOL, OR WHATEVER.
BUT JUST IN CASE, IT'S PROBABLY
BETTER THAT HE DOESN'T THINK
ANYTHING'S UP.
 HE'S GOING TO FREAK OUT ON MY
DECISION, BUT--
 I MEAN, IT'S-- YOU GOTTA DO
THE BEST THING FOR YOUR GAME.
 RIGHT.
 THIS IS THE BEST THING FOR
YOUR GAME, YOUR GAME, MY GAME,
AND KASS' GAME.
 EVERYONE'S GAME.
 WOO IS VERY QUIET, VERY
STEALTH, BUT I THINK WOO IS
READY TO MAKE A MOVE.
SO HOPEFULLY HE WILL DO WHAT HE
HAS SAID THAT HE WILL DO, AND I
JUST HAVE TO PUT ON AN ACT LIKE
I COULD BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.
 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS.
TASH.
YOU'RE A POWERFUL PLAYER, JUST
LIKE I AM.
IF I HAD WON IT, WOULD IT HAVE
BEEN SPENCE TONIGHT?
 I DON'T KNOW, MAN, TASHA.
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.
RIGHT NOW, I THINK IT'S YOU
TONIGHT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
 HE'S ENDURED A LOT, AND I'M
GLAD TO HAVE MADE 33 DAYS.
I'M GOING TO THE POND.
I'LL BE BACK.
 SHE'S TOO COMFORTABLE.
AND WHEN DID YOU EVER SEE HER
CONCEDE?
NO WAY.
TASH, OUT OF ALL PEOPLE, DID NOT
WIN IMMUNITY TODAY.
AND SHE'S NOT SCRAMBLING,
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE KNOWS IT'S
HER TONIGHT.
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.
USUALLY SHE'LL BE LIKE, "TRISH,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
TONY CAN I TALK TO YOU?"
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, SHE ALWAYS
DOES THAT.
AND NOW TODAY'S SHE'S NOT.
JUST IN CASE SHE DOES HAVE
ANYTHINGOON IDOL OR SOMETHING,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY MINE
TONIGHT, MAN.
IT'S ME OR HER TONIGHT.
 I THINK YOU SHOULD PLAY YOURS
TONIGHT.
 I AM PLAYING MINE TONIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING HOME AT SIX.
I HAVE TWO IDOLS.
ONE REGULAR IDOL AND ONE WITH
SPECIAL POWERS.
THE SPECIAL POWERS I HAVE IS I
CAN USE IT AFTER THE VOTES ARE
READ.
 DO YOU HAVE THE SPECIAL IDOL?
 I HAVE PLENTY OF STUFF, KID.
AT THIS POINT, I CANNOT CONFIRM
OR DENY.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY MY SPECIAL
IDOL TONIGHT BUT IF THEY CALL MY
TBLUF THAT I'M NOT USING THE
SPECIAL IDOL, AND THEY PUT MY
NAME DOWN, I HAVE TO USE THAT
SPECIAL IDOL, OR I GO HOME.
 ARE YOU DOWN WITH IT, BIG
CHANGE IN THE WORKS?
 LET'S HOPE IT GOES ACCORDING
TO PLAN?
 IT SHOULD.
 TASH KNOWS SHE NEEDS TO GET
RID OF TONY AND SHE KNOWS AS
LONG AS IT'S NOT HER, IT'S
GREAT.
 HE RAN HIS ALLIANCE BY FEAR
BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO HAS DOUBLE
CROSSED HIM--
 IS GONE.
 IS GONE.
I'M OVER IT.
HE'S LIKE OUR VERSION OF RUSSELL
HANTZ.
 HE'S SUCH A ( BLEEP )--
 ABSOLUTELY.
 NOT LIKABLE.
 HE'S A BULLY!
 HE IS.
 HYPOTHETICALLY, IF EVERYBODY
HATES HIM AS MUCH AS I DO, IT
ACTUALLY CAN CHANGE MY STRATEGY.
HE'S RUSSELL HANTZ.
 YEAH.
 JERSEY STYLE.
 JERSEY STYLE RUSSELL.
 ONE THING I LEARNED IN THIS
GAME IS IT CHANGES EVERY HOUR.
NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK IS HE
OUR RUSSELL WHO MAYBE MAKES IT
TO THE END AND THINKS HE'S GOD'S
GIFT?
I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
TONIGHT BASED ON CAN I BEAT TONY
IN THE FINAL TRIBAL?
AND NOBODY EVER GIVES THE JERK
THE MONEY.
SO MAYBE I KEEP HIM.
YOU WANT TO TALK FOR A MINUTE?
 OKAY.
 THIS IS THE POSITION I LOVE.
WHERE I'M REALLY THE ONE MAKING
A DECISION.
EITHER WAY, CHAOS WILL ENSUE.
 YOU'RE STICKING WITH THE
PLAN?
WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 KASS PULLS ME ASIDE AND SHE'S
LIKE, "DO WE WANT TO TAKE OUT
TONY AND TRISH OR TAKE OUT
TASHA?"
AND I'M SITTING HERE LIKE, WHOA.
THIS IS INSANE.
 I THINK WE'RE ABOUT IN THE
SAME BOAT RIGHT NOW.
 THIS GAME, IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THAT CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE
GAME, AND THAT IS MOMENTS BEFORE
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
SARAH, MORGAN, L.J., JEREMIAH,
AND JEFF REMARK VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
TASHA, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN
A LONG TIME YOU HAVE IS NOT HAD
THAT NECKLACE.
WHAT'S THE FEELING TONIGHT?
 WELL, IT'S BEEN MADE VERY
CLEAR PRETTY MUCH BY EVERYONE
THAT AS SOON AS YOU LOSE, YOU'RE
GOING HOME.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
ALL WE HEAR FROM TONY IS "I HAVE
THE SPECIAL IDOL WITH SPECIAL
POWERS.
I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL."
SO I'M HOPING THAT PEOPLE WILL
RECOGNIZE TONY FOR THE THREAT
THAT HE REALLY IS.
 JEFF, TODAY HER SCRAMBLING
WAS FAR FROM THE REGULAR, FAR
FROM THE NORM.
IT'S LIKE IT WASN'T EVEN AN
IMMUNITY NIGHT.
SO TO ME I GOT KIND OF WORRIED.
SHE'S BEEN ON A ROLL.
SHE'S WON HALF OF THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES SO HER NOT BEING
WORRIED MADE ME WORRIED AND
THAT'S WHY I GOT MY BAG WITH ME
AGAIN TONIGHT.
 Jeff: OF TRICKS?
 OF TRICKS.
 BUT, JEFF, THEY'RE PUTTING
THIS FALSE TARGET ON ME LIKE I'M
THE QUEEN OF IMMUNITY CHALLENGES
WHEN TONY IS THE BIGGER
STRATEGIC THREAT AND PUT MOST OF
THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE BUT NO
ONE WANTS TO SEE TJEFF.
 Jeff: SO, TONY, WHAT DO YOU
DO, WHEN YOU'RE CLEARLY TRYING
TO DEFLECT THE ATTENTION BUT
THERE'S ONLY SIX OF YOU?
 I KNOW FOR A FACT ANYTHING
CAN HAPPEN IN THIS GAME.
SPENCER AND TASH HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO PLANT THE SEED IN THE
HEAD THAT TONY IS DANGEROUS.
BUT THAT'S HER DEFLECTING THE
TARGET OFF HER BACK.
FOR MY ALLIANCE, WE'RE TIGHT.
WE'RE LOYAL.
WE'RE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.
AND THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ALL
ALONG, LOYALTY AND TRUST, JEFF.
 Jeff: KASS, DOES TONY'S
LOGIC I'M JUST RELYING ON
LOYALTY SEEM GENUINE OR
DISINGENUOUS?
 PROBABLY DISINGENUOUS.
WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO
HAVING A FINAL THREE OR FINAL
TWO.
SO I WOULD BE PARANOID IF I HAD
A BAG OF TRICKS.
 Jeff: SO IF EVERYBODY
BELIEVES THAT TONY HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND A SECOND IDOL,
THIS SEEMS LIKE AN OBVIOUS VOTE
TO FLUSH ONE OF THOSE TWO IDOLS
OUT.
 THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT.
 JEFF, WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO
FLUSH THE IDOLS OUT IF WE'RE
TOGETHER?
KEEPING THE IDOL AWAY FROM THE
ENEMY HELPS THE ALLIANCE.
I'M NOT SAYING I'M GOING TO USE
IT FOR EVERYBODY WHEN THERE ARE
JUST FOUR LEFT--
 AND HE WAS PERFECTLY HONEST
WITH US THAT HE DID GET THE
IMMUNITY IDOL AND IF NEED BE HE
WOULD USE IT ON US IF WE NEEDED
IT.
 Jeff: WOO, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO FLUSH SOMEBODY'S BACK OF
TRICKS, ONE OR TWO IDOLS, AT
THIS POINT IN THE GAME?
 YEAH, WE WOULD WANT TO FLUSH
THAT OUT, BECAUSE THE FURTHER HE
ADVANCES, THE MORE HE CAN
DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU GO OR
YOU GO SIT ON THE JURY.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THIS?
 WELL, THERE'S A POINT TO BE
MADE THAT AFTER VOTING OUT
JEFRA, TONY DOES WHAT HE ALWAYS
DOES-- HE SCOOPS BACK THE PEOPLE
IN HIS ALLIANCE THAT WERE
BLINDSIDED, AND HE SAYS, "DON'T
WORRY.
WE'RE STILL TOGETHER."
AND THEY BELIEVE IT.
AND I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHEN IT
WILL CHANGE.
BUT I'M EXCITED.
YOU KNOW, TONY DID BRING HIS BAG
OF TRICKS, AND I BELIEVE WE'RE
GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT
AFTER A LONG WAIT TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
 Jeff: WHAT DO I THINK IS
GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT, WOO?
IS THERE A PLAN THAT YOU THINK
IS GOING TO PLAY OUT?
 YOU KNOW, WE-- WE AGREED UPON
ONE THING, AND THE VOTE'S GOING
TO BE WHAT WE ALL AGREED UPON.
 Jeff: TONY'S SHAKING HIS
HEAD NO.
 I'M HOPING THAT THE FOUR
STICK TOGETHER AND TASH GOES
HOME TONIGHT, JEFF.
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR.
 Jeff: KASS, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT?
 IT'S FUN TO FANTASIZE YOU'RE
IN THE FINAL THREE AND WHO'S
GOING TO VOTE FOR ME AND STUFF,
BUT YOU ALSO STILL HAVE TO GET
THERE.
YOU KNOW, HOW AM I GOING TO GET
THERE?
WHO AM I GOING TO GET THERE
WITH?
AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
I THINK TONIGHT MIGHT BE A
BLINDSIDE.
 Jeff: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
BANKING ON TASHA?
 THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR,
JEFF.
THAT WE BLINDSIDE.
I'D BE HAPPY TO STAY HERE, EVEN
IN THE RAIN.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
TONY, YOU'RE UP.
 YOU'VE BEEN IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT FOR A LONG TIME.
TIME TO MOVE OVER.
 TRISH, SOMEONE HAS TO GO
TONIGHT.
BETTER YOU THAN ME.
 SORRY, YOU PLAYED AN AWESOME
GAME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY TNOW
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTE.
FIRST VOTE, TASHA.
TONY.
TRISH.
ONE VOTE TASHA, ONE VOTE TONY,
ONE VOTE TRISH.
THAT'S TWO VOTES TASHA, ONE VOTE
TONY, ONE VOTE TRISH.
12th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
TASHA.
THAT'S THREE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
TASHA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
WELL, SPENCER, BASED ON
TONIGHT'S VOTE, IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE ON THE
OUTSIDE OF THIS GROUP.
BUT GIVEN UNPREDICTABLE WAY
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING, IT MAY
NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":
 I TOLD YOU SOMETHING IN
SECRECY.
AND THEN YOU COME HERE AND YOU
BLOW IT OUT.
 Jeff: CHAOS KASS IS BACK.
 I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
YOU, KASS.
 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME YOU
WANT AS MUCH PARANOIA AS YOU CAN
STIR UP.
 Jeff: BUT THIS TIME SHE'S
MET HER MATCH.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH
ME KASS AND ACT LIKE YOU'RE
GOING TO WIN AT EVERYTHING.
I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU, SISTER,
YOU'RE NOT!
 GIVEN THE START I HAD AT THE
LUZON TRIBE, TO MAKE IT THIS FAR
IN THE GAME IS AMAZING.
I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN HERE AND
IT'S A BLESSING.
I THOUGHT AT THE END I GOT VOTED
OUT BECAUSE I WAS STRONG IN
CHALLENGES, AND HONESTLY, THE
CASTAWAYS WERE PROBABLY SMART TO
GET RID OF ME WHEN THEY DID
BECAUSE I FELT I HAD ANOTHER
IMMUNITY RUN IN ME
