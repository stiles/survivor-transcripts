        BACK HOME I'M A POLICE
OFFICER AND CAN'T BE CORRUPT.
OUT HERE I'M LYING MY ASSOFF.
MY BABY AND MY WIFE WE'RE GOING
TO THE END.
I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER AND DEAD
DAD.
 I THINK I WILL WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN.
 YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN?








YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME.
FISEE AN OPPORTUNITY, I'M GOING
TO JUMP ON IT.
WOW!
THAT'S THE THIRD IDOL THAT I
FOUND THIS GAME.
I'M KING OF THE JUNGLE!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: THIS IS THE REUNION
PORTION OF OUR SHOW RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE JUST CROWNED OR LATEST
WINNER, NEW JERSEY POLICE
OFFICER, TONY.
CONGRATULATIONS.








 THANK YOU, JEFF.
FIRST THING I GOTTA SAY IS YOU
REALLY DO HAVE A WIFE AND SHE
WAS GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT,
BUT SHE IS LITERALLY ON BED REST
FROM HER DOCTOR BECAUSE SHE IS
DUE ANY SECOND.
 THAT'S CORRECT, THAT'S
CORRECT.

 Jeff: ANOTHER BABY.
 SO SHE'S GOING TO GET THE
PINK CHANDELIER.
 SHE'S GOING TO GET THE PINK
CHANDELIER, JEFF.
 Jeff: I WANT TO RIP THROUGH
SOME OF THIS STUFF.
FAN REACTION, FOR ME, THE WHOLE
SEASON, YOU WERE VERY
POLARIZING.
WHAT'S IT BEEN FOR YOU?
 YOU HEARD THE CROWD.
IT WAS A GAME, JEFF.
 Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT'S BEEN THE FAN REACTION?
 I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF
HATE TWEETS, BOOS FROM THE
AUDIENCE.
IT WAS A GAME.
I DISTINGUISHED THE GAME FROM
REAL LIFE, AND I DID A LOT OF
DIRTY STUFF ON TV, A LOT OF
LYING, A LOT OF MANIPULATING, A
LOT OF BACKSTABBING.
I HAD NO PLEASURE IN THAT AT
ALL.
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO TO WIN.
 Jeff: IT SEEMED TO ME YOU
PLAYED A VERY INTULSIVE GAME.
IS THAT HOYOU SAW IT?
 TIFS INTULSIVE AT THE MOMENT.
AND AT NIGHT I HAD TIME TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT I DID, MOLD UP, I
CAN'T DO THAT.
AND I HAD A CHANCE TO REASSESS
WHAT I SAID THROUGHOUT THE DAY
AND KEPT CHANGING MY MIND AT
NIGHT.
IIN THE MOMENT.
 GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT.
MY MOUTH IS DRY.
I CAN'T EVEN TALK.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT
SLEEPING AT NIGHT, THEN.
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE
GAME ALL NIGHT.
IS THAT TRUE?
 JEFF, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FROM
DAY ONE, I DID NOT SLEEP AT
NIGHT.
I SLEPT SIX HOURS A WEEK, IF
THAT.
DURING THE DAY, WHATEVER DI,
DURING THE DAY, AT NIGHT TIME IT
WAS DAMAGE CONTROL FOR
EVERYTHING I DID.
I DUG MYSELF A HOLE TOURING THE
DAY, AND AT NIGHT I DUG MYSELF
OUT OF THE HOLE.
 Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT THE
WEAR AND TEAR.
BECAUSE YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME
EARLY THEY'RE IT LITERALLY TOOK
YOU MONTHS.
 I WAS OUT OF THE WORK FOR
THREE MONTHS WHEN I GOT BACK
FROM THE SHOW.
I HAD PARASITES IN MY STOMACH.
I I WAS ON DOCTOR CARE.
I LOST 45 POUND.
SO THAT WEIGHT WAS WRONG.
I WAS 195-- YOU SAW ME.
 Jeff: THAT LITTLE
"SURVIVOR" SCALE DIDN'T WORK?
 AND I WAS BEAT UP FOR THREE
MONTHS.
AND NOW HERE'S A YEAR LATERRISH
STILL CAN'T PUT THE MASS ON.
I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE GYM AND
CAN'T DO IT.
 Jeff: LET'S GO THROUGH SOME
OF THE RELATIONSHIPS.
ONE OF THE ONES EVERYBODY WAS
ASKING ME ABOUT WAS TRISH.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE--
( APPLAUSE )
TRISH GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FROM
A LOT OF PEOPLE, BETH ON TWITTER
SAYS, "WHY TRISH, WHEN SHE'S THE
ONLY ONE OUT THERE WHO TRUSTED
YOU?"
 THAT'S THE TRUTH, JEFF.
THAT'S WHY YOU SAW ME.
THAT HURT ME THE MOST.
THAT DEVASTATED ME.
 Jeff: WHY WAS THE THINKING?
 IT WAS KASS THEY FELT NOBODY
LIKED AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE I
WANTED TO GET RID OF.
AND IT WAS BETWEEN WOO AND
EVERYBODY LOVED AND TRISH WHO
EVERYBODY LOVED.
IF I KEPT WOO IT WOULD HELP ME
BEAT SPENCE.
 Jeff: SO STRATEGY.
 THERE WAS A SECRET SCENE.
WHEN I VOTED TRISH OUT, I
SAID,"TRISH, PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
IT WAS STRICTLY STRATEGIC."
 Jeff: TRISH, WHAT IS THE
RELATIONSHIP NOW?
YOU SEEMED VERY HURT AT TRIBAL?
 I WAS REALLY HURT FOR, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTE.
IT'S A GAME AND I UNDERSTOOD
THAT.
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH TONE
SEREALLY WELL-- REALLY GOOD NOW.
HE STALKS ME, TEXTS ME 15 TIMES
A DAY.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE FRIENDS?
 YES.
 Jeff: KASS, ANOTHER-- WHAT
WAS IT WITH YOU TWO?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M SURPRISED ABOUT THAT.
WHAT WAS IT BETWEEN YOU AND
TONY?
 TONY IS LIKE MY JERKY
BROTHER.
LIKE, WE WOULD FIGHT.
HE WOULD SPEAK IN TONGUES TO ME.
AND THEN WE WOULD GO DOWN BEACH
AND SAY, "ARE WE GOOD?"
"YEAH, WE'RE GOOD."
WE WERE A HORRIBLE BROTHER AND
SISTER BUT WE PLAYED SO HARD.
 Jeff: ARE YOU TWO TALKING?
 , OF COURSE, JEFF.
WE LEFT EVERYTHING AT THE GAME.
 Jeff: REALLY?
 YEAH, EVERYBODY STAYED AT THE
GAME.
SHE DID SOME IDIOTIC MOVES THEY
FELT WERE IDIOTIC.
 FOR EXAMPLE, KASS WANTED TO
TAKE ME TO THE END.
KASS, HERE'S A SECRET.
WHAT DOES SHE DO?
SHE TELLS WOO AND TELLS ME
THAT'S STRATEGIC.
HOW IS THAT STRATEGIC?
SHE ALMOST GOT HERSELF VOTED
OFF.
BUT I-- I WANTED TO VOTE HER
OFF.
BUT AT NIGHT, I SAID, HOLD UP.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
 Jeff: CAN YOU JUST-- LIKE
15 SECONDS-- TALK LLAMA TO KASS.
OKAY.
( APPLAUSE )
SARAH, BY THE WAY,
CONGRATULATIONS BECAUSE YOU ARE
PREGNANT AS WELL.
 YES.
( APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: SO ONE OF THE MOST
INTERESTING RELATIONSHIPS IS WE
HAVE TWO COPS, ONE FROM JERSEY,
ONE FROM INDIANA.
YOU INSTANTLY KNEW HE WAS A COP.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
 YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH TONY PLAY
THE GAME, AND HE JUST CONSTANTLY
OBSERVING.
HE FINDS THREE IDOLS, HE FINDS
CLUES.
THAT'S HOW HE IS INSIDE THE
GAME.
THAT'S HOW HE IS OUTSIDE THE
GAME.
HE CANNOT SHUT THAT OFF.
 Jeff: SO YOUR COP INSTINCT
LET YOU KNOW HE'S ONE OF ME, ONE
OF US?
 HE OBSERVES THINGS LIKE I
OBSERVE THINGS.
AND MY COWORKERS DO.
 Jeff: OKAY, ON THE FLIP
SIDE, HOW QUICKLY DID YOU DECIDE
OR WHEN DID YOU DECIDE YOU WERE
GOING TO LIE ABOUT BEING A
CONSTRUCTION WORKER?
 WELL, BEFORE-- I MEAN, COPS,
YOU LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM, FOR
THE MOST PART.
I PULL YOU OVER BECAUSE YOU RAN
A RED LIGHT.
IT'S MY FAULT FOR GIVING YOU A
TICKET.
"THERE ARE SO MANY CRIMINALS OUT
THERE.
WHY REPORT YOU CHASING THEM?"
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE ME.
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU'LL SAY THIS
MAN IS STREAMIC AND SHARP AND
QUICK.
IT WAS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.
SO I SAID LET ME BE A
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.
 Jeff: HERE'S WHERE IT GOT
REALLY TRICKY IS LATER IN THE
GAME TONY DECIDE I'M GOING TO
ADMIT I WAS A COP, AND THEN HE
SWEARS ON HIS BADGE, THE COPS
"R" US, AND THEN HE BETRAYS
SARPAP TAKE A LOOK.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
 SWEAR ON YOUR BADGE YOU WON'T
TURN YOUR BACK ON YOU.
 I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING I LOVE
I WON'T TURN MY BACK TO YOU.
SHE HAD ME SWEAR ON MY BADGE AND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
I'M HERE TO LIE, CHEAT, AND
STEAL AND DRAG PEOPLE'S DREAMS
THROUGH MUD SO I CAN FULFILL
MINE.
 Jeff: NOW YOU'VE REALLY
FLIPPED THE SWITCH, BECAUSE NOW
YOU'VE TAKEN THE BLUE BLOOD, THE
TRUST, AND LIED.
WHAT'S THE REACTION BEEN BACK
FOR YOU, BACK HOME?
 WELL, THE THING, IS JEFF,
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO I AM AS A
COP.
THEY KNOW WHAT I DO.
THEY KNOW WHO I AM AS A PERSON.
WHAT I DID IN THE GAME HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH LIFE.
I TOLD SARA, I SWEAR ON ANYTHING
OUT THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I DIDN'T BREAK MY LOYALTY TO
PEOPLE, IF I TOLD THE TRUTH,
EVERYBODY THE TRUTH, I'D BE
SITTING ON THE JURY.
I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I'M AT
TONIGHT.
I HAD TO DO WHAT I HAD TO DO IN
THE GAME TO ADVANCE MYSELF.
 Jeff: SARAH, HE'S SAYING
IT'S JUST A GAME, EVEN THOUGH I
TOOK THE THING THEY KNEW WAS
HOLIEST AND YOU VALUED THE MOST
WAS YOUR BADGE, WHAT'S YOUR
RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH TONY BASED
ON THAT?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, AS WE GOT OUT
OF THE GAME, TONY AND I DID HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.
WE TALKED FOR QUITE A WHILE.
AND WHEN I GET VOTED OUT AND DO
SOME INTERVIEWS, TONY HAS A FEW
CHOICE WORD, AND BY THAT I MEAN
500 TWEETS ABOUT ME.
IN A NEGATIVE TONE.
AND HE WANTS TO SAY HE'S NOT
THAT TYPE OF PERSON.
BUT HE KIND OF PROVED IT TO ME
--
 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE COP
THING.
WHAT'S THE COP THING.
YOU KNOW HE HE'S A COP.
HE SAYS I AM A COP AND WE'RE
GOOD TO GO AND BETRAYS YOU.
THAT'S THE THING THAT SEEMED TO
GET TO YOUR GUT.
DO YOU FORGIVE HIM OR SAY I'LL
NEVER TRUST THIS GUY AGAIN?
 I DID FORGIVE IT, AND I FELT
LIKE HE SHOWED HIS TRUE COLORS.
HE HAS APOLOGIZED SINCE THEM --
 ARE YOU GUYS TALKING?
 NO, WE'RE NOT.
 Jeff: YOU'RE NOT.
SO IS THIS A RIVALRY.
 THERE IS STILL A COPS "R" US
BUT TONE SENO LONGER IN IT.
 Jeff: WE HAVE A FELLOW--
SORRY ABOUT THAT I DIDN'T EVEN
WAIT FOR YOU.
WE HAVE A FELLOW OFFICER,
NICK HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 YOU'RE PUTTING HIM ON THE
SPOT, BRO.
YOU'RE A LIEUTENANT.
I WORK WITH TONY.
 YES, I DO.
 Jeff: SO OBVIOUSLY PLAYED A
VERY AGGRESSIVE GAME.
WHAT WAS THE REACTION?
WERE THERE OTHER COPS SAYING,
DUDE, YOU REALLY DIDN'T DO US
RIGHT?
 WE KNEW HE WAS OUT THERE.
HE WAS OUT THERE FOR ONE REASON
AND THAT WAS TO WIN THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
WE WANTED HIM TO BE THE SOLE
SURVIVOR, AND HE IS THE SOLE
SURVIVOR.
SO HE WENT OUT THERE.
HE MADE US PROUD.
 Jeff: REALLY?
SO THERE'S NO BAD BLOOD BACK
HOME?
 IT WAS A GAME.
HE WAS OUT THERE FOR ONE
MISSION, TO GET THE JOB DONE, HE
GOT THE JOB DONE.
WE KNEW WHY HE WAS OUT THERE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I WANT TO SAY, NICK CAME OUT
HERE REALLY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO
SPEAK UP FOR TONY, AND
AMAZINGLY, TWO NIGHTS AGO,
THERE'S AN ARTICLE IN A LOCAL
NEW JERSEY PAPER TALKING ABOUT
JUST WHAT IT IS TO BE A COP.
THROW THAT HEADLINE UP.
THIS IS TONY.
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT TONY,
SAVING A GUY'S LIFE.
TONY, YOU KNOW THIS STORY.
WHAT-- BASICALLY, WHAT HAPPENED?
THERE WAS A GUY THAT WAS YOUR--
THAT WAS VISITING NEXT DOOR AND
COLLAPSED?
 YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT, JEFF.
I HAD A NEIGHBOR EYE MOVED INTO
A NEW TOWN.
AND MY NEIGHBOR CAME OVER TO
HELP ME WITH THE SHOVEL, AND HE
WENT TO CARDIAC ARREST.
AND HE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR,
TURNED BLUE.
HE PRETTY MUCH PASSED AWAY, NO
PULSE, RUN RESPONSIVE, NO SIGNS
OF LIFE.
I WAS WITH MY BUDDY PURPOSE WE
WERE PARTICIPATING.
WE IMMEDIATELY STARTED C.P.R.,
ON THE GUY, AND SAVED HIS LIFE,
JEFF.
HERE WE ARE, TWO, THREE MONTHS
LATER AND THE GUY IS STRONG AS A
BULL.
HE HAD QUADRUPLE BYPASS, AND
HE'S AN ANGEL.
 Jeff: AWESOME STORY.
( APPLAUSE )
AND THAT'S WHY THIS GAME WORKS
BECAUSE YOU TAKE PEOPLE FROM
DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE, AND
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON
WHAT A GAME IS AND WHAT'S OKAY.
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.
TYLER PERRY IS HERE.
AND BY THE WAY, ANY OF YOU WHO
DIDN'T LIKE THE SPECIAL IDOL,
YOU CAN JUST BLAME HIM.
WE'LL TALK TO HIM IN A LITTLE
BIT.
PLUS I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO
SPENCER.
I KNOW, SHOCKING.
I WAS WRONG.
AND UP NEXT, JURY ARE DON'T
ANSWER YET, I WANT TO KNOW, WE
ALL WANT TO KNOW, DID WOO MAKE A
MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE?
THAT'S NEXT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.
 YOU TAKE KASS, YOU HAVE ZERO
CHANCE OF WINNING.
IS HE BUYING IT?
I WOULDN'T BUY IT.
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH KASS.
( APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: WE'RE LIVE IN LOS
ANGELES.
IT'S THE REUNION OF "SURVIVORS
BRAINS, BRAWN, BEAUTY."
I WANT TO POLL THE JURY.
WOO HAD THIS WHOLE IDEA I'D BE
STUPID TO TAKE TONY.
THEN TONY DOES A NUMBER ON HIM.
HE END UP TAKING TONEY AND TONY
WINS.
EVERYBODY WHO HAD BEEN IN THE
JURY, IF YOU WOULD HAVE VOTED
FOR WOO IF HE WAS UP AGAINST
KASS, RAISE YOUR HAND.
SO, WOO, WHAT-- ARE YOU OKAY
RIGHT NOW?
YOU SEEM YOU SEEM A LITTLE DOWN,
WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED.
BUT ARE YOU?
 FEELING FANTASTIC.
THE LOVE, THE SUPPORT, BEING ON
THE SHOW.
YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR ANY MORE.
GIVE IT UP FOR TONY ONE MORE
TIME FOR A HECK OF A GAME.
WELL DONE.
WELL DONE.
 Jeff: SO, WOORKS I'M GOING
TO GUESS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT
HOME ARE THINKING RIGHT NOW--
AND THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE ON
THIS GAME-- AGE VERSUS YOUTH,
EXPERIENCE VERSUS, YOU KNOW, A
GUY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
YET, THAT THAT WAS REALLY A
MILLION-DOLLAR LIFE LESSON.
YOU KNEW, YOUR GUT SAID TAKE
KASS.
AND THEN YOU TAKE TONY.
ANY REGRETS ON THAT AT ALL?
JUST FROM A GAME POINT OF VIEW.
 THE DECISION THAT I MADE WAS
BASED ON HOW I LIVE AND HOW I
COMPETED IN MARTIAL ART, AND
TIKWAN DO, AND THAT WAS
CHALLENGE YOURSELF, COMPETE, BUT
COMPETE AGAINST THE BEST.
THAT BEING SAID, I TOOK TONY,
BECAUSE I SAID, IN MY HEAD, WE
ALL KNOW, HE PLAYED A GREAT
GAME.
FIBEAT THE BEST, BOOM.
THERE WE GO.
IF I LOSE, WELL, I KEEP MY HEAD
UP.
AND I KNOW THAT I LOST --
 THERE YOU GO.
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
( APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: TASHA, YOU-- HOW MANY
TIMES HAVE YOU APPLIED TO BE THE
ON SHOW?
 THREE TIMES, JEFF.
 Jeff: AND YOU WIND UP ON
ARGUABLY THE WORST TRIBE IN THE
HISTORY OF THE SHOW.
 YES.
 Jeff: WHAT'S THAT INITIAL
FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU SEE THE SHIP
STARTING TO SINK?
 OH, MAN, TO BE ON THE SHOW
WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.
I GET ON LUZON, AND I'M LIKE
LITERALLY IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THE
FATE OF MY GAME WAS WHAT IT WAS.
 Jeff: SO WHAT DID YOU-- NOW
THAT IT'S OVER, WHAT'S THE
BIGGEST LESSON IF YOU PLAYED
AGAIN?
 IF I PLAYED AGAIN I WOULD--
TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOU CAN,
YOU KNOW, PLAY LIKE YOU WILL
NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
PLAY AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOMEONE OUT,
SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU, ANY TIME SOMEONE IS A
HINDERENCE TO YOUR GAME, GET
THEM OUT.
 Jeff: I OFTEN SAY IT'S PLAY
THE FIRST TIME AS THOUGH YOU'RE
PLAYING FOR THE SECOND TIME.
 YES, YES.
 Jeff: AND YOU GOT A LOT OF
LOVE.
ONE SAID TASHA SHOULD BE BACK.
BEST PLAYER THIS YEAR.
NICE GUY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL, HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST
ENJOYABLE PLAYERS TO WATCH THIS
SEASON, CLEARLY A FAN FAVORITE.
AND IN LARGE PART, IT'S BECAUSE
EVEN THOUGH NOTHING EVER WENT
RIGHT FOR SPENCER, HE NEVER GAVE
UP.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 I WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF
THE WORST TRIBES IN "SURVIVOR
HISTORY.
OF.
 Jeff: DISASTER FOR THE
BRAIN TRIBE.
 THIS GAME IS A COMPLETE
ROLLER COASTER RIDE, AND I'M
JUST HAPPY THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN
OFF YET.
 Jeff: SPENCER GOES FOR IT
AND SUCCEEDS!
 YOU GOT SOMETHING OVER THERE,
DUDE.
MY POSITION IS JUST ON THE BRINK
OF ECSTASY AND DEVASTATION ALL
THE TIME.
 Jeff: $500 GETS YOU A WHITE
ROCK.
 I PLAYED WELL, AND I THINK I
PLAYED HARD, AND I CAN GO HOME
HAPPY WITH THAT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT A
FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU, SPENCER,
BUT A FORMER "SURVIVOR" ACTUALLY
ASKS MY FIRST QUESTION BETTER
THAN I COULD.
IT'S JOHN COCHRAN, WHO SAYS,
ASK SPENC SPENCER IF HE SUFFERS
FROM P.T.S.D. EVERY TIME HE
RESIDENT A CHARLIE BROWN COMIC?"
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE THE FOOTBALL
KEPT GETTING PULLED OUT.
 YES, VERY MUCH SO.
IT WAS A CHARLIE BROWN GAME.
 AND KEPT TRYING TO KICK THE
FOOTBALL, AND IT KEPT GETTING
SWIPED AWAY.
THAT SAID, I DON'T BLAME ANYONE
OTHER THAN MYSELF FOR IT BEING
SWIPED AWAY.
YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY LACKED
THINGS IN MY GAME THAT I SHOULD
HAVE STOPPED IT FROM BEING SWEPT
AWAY.
 Jeff: ELECTRIC BLOND 7
SAYS, "SPENCER, THE CHALLENGE
BEAST, IF YOU COULD GO BACK TO
ANY POINT IN THE GAME--" YOU
RETHOUGHT THIS MANY TIMES.
IS
THERE A POINT WHERE YOU THOUGHT
IF I GO LEFT IT WOULD BE
DIFFERENT?
 I GUESS THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE
WOULD BE WITH JEFRA.
THERE WAS A POINT AT THE FINAL
EIGHT WHERE JEREMIAH AND TASHA
AND I WERE TRYING TO PULL HER TO
OUR SIDE, AND I HAD AN IDOL.
AND I THINK IF I HAD BEEN A
LITTLE MORE OPEN WITH MY
ALLIANCE AND SHARED THAT, IT
COULD HAVE BODIED REALLY WELL
FOR US.
WE COULD HAVE SOLIDIFIED THAT
NUMBER.
 Jeff: WHAT'S THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR GAME AND
TONY'S GAME?
 I RESPECT TONY'S GAME
TREMENDOUSLY.
BUT IT'S TOTALLY OPPOSITE FROM
MINE.
I WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE IS THAT TONY, AS
WE'VE DISCUSSED, REALLY OPERATED
ON SOME REALLY GOOD INSTINCTS.
 Jeff: FOLLOW YOUR GUT.
 YEAH.
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK I
LACKED.
I THINK I'M MANUFACTURE A
CEREBRAL PLAYER.
I CAN GET LOST IN NIGH HEAD A
LITTLE BIT.
AND THOSE INSTINCTS WERE
DEFINITELY THERE.
 Jeff: IT'S A THEME THAT
COMES UP A LOT, THERE'S A BOOK,
MALCOLMGLAD WELL, "BLINK" THAT
SAYS YOUR GUT KNOWS BUT IT TAKES
A LONG TIME FOR OUR GET TO
LISTEN.
IF YOU PLAY THE GAME YOU HAVE TO
LISTEN TO YOUR GUT AND MAKE THE
MOVE.
THERE'S ONE MORE THING WE HAVE
TO DO.
OVER THE YEARS I HAVE PREJUDGED
A LOT OF PLAYERS.
VE NEVER LABELE LABELED AND BEEN
WRONG ABOUT SOMEBODY AS MUCH AS
I WAS ABOUT SPENCER.
SP HERE'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED.
DURING CASTING, YOU KIND OF GO
AT IT.
DURING CASTING I SAID YOU HAVE
NO CHANCE OF WINNING.
I SAID THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAVE
OF WINNING IS IF THERE'S A CLONE
OF YOU SITTING NEXT TO YOU AT
THE END.
THAT'S HOW UNLIKELY IT IS.
AND SPENCER AT ONE POINT SAID,
WELL, IF YOU'RE WRONG, AND I
, WILL YOU WRITE ME A ALL LETTER
AND READ IT AT THE LIVE SHOW.
 RIGHT.
 AND HE WALKED OUT THE DOOR
AND I THOUGHT OH, MY GOD.
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO WRITE A
LETTER AND READ IT ON THE LIVE
SHOW.
YOU DIDN'T WIN BUT I HAVE TO
TELL SOMETHING, ON DAY 15 OR 16,
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR YOU WERE
GOING TO GO BUT YOU HAD PROVEN
YOUR POINT.
I WAS VERY WRONG.
YOU WERE WRITE.
I WROTE YOU THE ALL RIGHT.
I SENT IT BACK TO MYSELF FROM
THE PHILIPPINES.
IT'S UNOPENED.
IT'S STAMPED.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID,
BUT BASICALLY, I'M REALLY PROUD
OF THE GAME YOU PLAYED, AND YOU
WERE RIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
 THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
TYLER PERREERK ONE OF THE MOST
PROLIFIC STORYTELLERS IN
HOLLYWOOD, IS A MASSIVE
"SURVIVOR" FAN.
HE'S NEXT.
I NEED AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 THE SEARCH PARTY IS ON.
 WHO THE HELL LOOKS FOR THE
IDOL IN THE MIDDLE OF A TYPHOON?
THIS GUY.
 I FOUND IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF
KASS' FACE AND SHE DIDN'T SEE.
 I HOLD A PIECE OF THIS GAME
THAT'S PRICELESS.
 WOW!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
REUNION SHOW.
WRITER, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, HE'S
AN ACTOR, TYLER PERRY IS A
HOLLYWOOD POWERHOUSE.
YOU KNOW HIM FROM "HOUSE OF
PAIN," BUT HE'S ALSO A MASSIVE
"SURVIVOR FAN.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT
APPEALS TO YOU?
 OUTWIT, OUTLAST, OUTPLAY.
I LOVE EVERYTHING THAT AMERICA
LOVES ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN ON SO LONG.
IT'S A HUGE HIT, IT'S AMAZING.
 Jeff: I GET THESE TEXTS--
 ALL THE TIME.
 Jeff: FROM TYLER.
 I GOT AN IDEA.
 Jeff: IT WILL BE THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT AND MY PHONE WILL
GO OFF AND I'LL GO IT'S TYLER
PERRY.
AND YOU HAD ONE THIS YEAR TO DO
THE IDOL--
 LAY IT ALL ON ME BECAUSE YOU
GOT SO MUCH BACKLASH FOR IT.
LAY IT ALL ON ME.
 Jeff: I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT
THE BACKLASH WHEN I'LL GET TO.
WE SAID HERE'S WHAT YOU DO AN
IDOL THAT'S SAFE AFTER THE VOTE.
WE DID THAT BEFORE.
BUT HIS KICKER WAS, PUT IT LATE
IN THE SHORE DON'T GIVE A CLUE
MAYBE THEY'LL FIND IT AND MAYBE
THEY WON'T.
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN TONY
FOUND IT?
 I WASN'T HAPPY.
I LOVE COPS AND FIREMEN AND
EVERYBODY.
I JUST DID NOT WANT TONE TOW
FIND THE DAMN IDOL.
I WANTED SPENCER TO FIND IT OR
TASHA TO FIND IT.
 Jeff: YES, OKAY, SO,
PERFECT.
THIS IS MY QUESTION.
LET'S JUST SAY SPENCER, HAD
SPENCER FOUND TWOULD YOU HAVE
LOVED IT?
( APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: SO IT WASN'T THE IDOL
YOU DEPARTMENT LIKE, IT'S WANT
FACT THAT THE BIG IDOL HOG FOUND
IT.
 HE FOUND THAT IDOL, AND TO
FIND IT WITHOUT CLUES.
HE PLAYED A GREAT GAME, SO HE
DID DESERVE TO WIN, NO MATTER IF
HE WEE THOUGHT HE PLAYED
UNDERHANDED.
 Jeff: TONY, HOW QUICKLY DID
YOU DECIDE TO LIE.
THAT WAS SOMETHING I NEVER
ANTICIPATED THAT YOU COULD USE
IT LATER THAN YOU REALLY COULD.
 ONE OF MY OVERNIGHT SPEECHES
WITH THE MOON, JEFF.
I SAID TO MYSELF, WHAT WOULD I
DO IN A SITUATION AS A POLICE
OFFICER.
AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, THEE
CRIMINALS SEE THREE BENTLEYS.
THEY WANT TO STEAL ONE.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE,
SUPER-DELEGATE UP, RIMS, HAS A
CLUB ON IT.
AND THEY'LL WALK AWAY FROM THAT.
AND I PUT THE CLUB ON ME AND
SAID STEAL SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR.
 Jeff: IF THERE'S ANYTHING
TO BE LEARNED FROM THE SEASON.
LOOK FOR IDOLSES.
WHY IS TONY THE ONLY GUY OUT
THERE DIGGING?
 WHY ARE YOU WAITING FOR A
CLUE?
START DIGGING AND FIND IT.
I THINK RUSSELL FOUND-- HE WAS
FINDING THEM THE SAME WAY,
RIGHT.
 Jeff: JUST GOING OUT.
 ABOUT THE SAME.
 Jeff: WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE
GOING ON?
 MY NOW SHOW "THE HAVE AND
HAVE NOT "RETURNS ON THE OPRAH
WINFREY NETWORK NEXTED IT SO
WE'RE EXCITED EXOOITED ABOUT
THAT.
 Jeff: TYLER, I LOVE THE
IDEA.
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUR WIFE.
 Jeff: THANK YOU.
WHAT A GUY.
MORE OF THE REUNION SHOW-- I'M
SPEECHLESS-- WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
♪
 Jeff: WE'RE STILL BACK.
I DON'T EVEN NEED THIS.
I JUST LIKE HOLDING IT.
SO OUR REUNION SHOW.
JOE, WILL YOU DO A SHOT OF
EVERYBODY.
THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING GROUP
OF PLAYERS.
HERE THEY ALL ARE.
HAVEN'T TALKED TO EVERYBODY YET.
LET'S GO DOWN THE THE LINE.
CLIFF, YOU PLAYED IN OBVIOUSLY
ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARENAS OF
SPORTS OF ALL TIME, THE N.B.A.
WHERE DOES THIS EXPERIENCE RANK
FOR YOU IN TERMS OF A
COMPETITION?
 IT DEFINITELY RANKS UP THERE
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, BASKETBALL,
YOU KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT
I DID PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE LIFE.
IT JUST CAME SECOND NATURE TO
ME.
SO "SURVIVOR" IS DEFINITELY A
LOT TOUGHER THAN BASKETBALL.
 Jeff: WOULD YOU PLAY AGAIN?
 , OF COURSE,, OF COURSE,.
 Jeff: DOWN ON THE END.
DAVID, YOU'RE A BIG-TIME
EXECUTIVE.
YOU MAKE THESE MILLION-DOLLAR
DECISIONS.
YOU SHOCKED ME WHEN OUT OF THE
GATE YOU HIT THE GUY NEXT TO
YOU, GARRETT, AS THE GUY TO SEND
OUT OF HERE.
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THAT
MOMENT, YOU WERE SO FAST EYE
DIDN'T EVEN FINISH THE
QUESTION-- ANY REGRET ABOUT THAT
RASH DECISION?
 NO, I THINK IT WAS MY ONLY
PLAY.
I WAS PLAYING TO WIN, AND I LOST
THE PENNANT IN APRIL AND I
EXPECTED TO BE THERE IN OCTOBER.
 Jeff: I GOTTA SAY, WHETHER
YOU FINISH FIRST OUT OR IN WOO'S
CASE, 19th OUT, YOU STILL
ARE NOT WINNING.
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL SWING FOR
THE FENCERS.
 THERE IS ONE WINNER.
THERE ARE 17 LOSERS HERE.
I WAS JUST THE FIRST ONE.
 Jeff: GARRETT, YOU CAME IN
OBVIOUSLY A BIG GUY, BUFF.
WERE YOU SURPRISED HOW HARD THIS
GAME HIT YOU?
 YEAH, PFS AMAZING TO ME HOW
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY I FELL
APART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
 Jeff: IS IT HARD TO WATCH
THAT?
 IT WAS MISERABLE.
TO MAKE SO MANY MISTAKE NAS GAME
THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND
SOMETHING I WANTED SO BAD WAS
REALLY DEVASTATING BUT LUCKILY
I'VE HAD A YEAR TO DEAL WITH IT.
 Jeff: LET'S GO DOWN TO
MORGAN.
MORGAN YOU TOOK A LOT OF GRIEF
FROM PEOPLE.
YOU'RE ON THE BEAUTY TRIBE, AND
I ASKED YOU AT TRIBAL, YOU'RE
USED TO THIS,ANT YOU, GETTING
EVERYTHING FOR FREE, BASED ON
YOUR LOOKS.
AND YOU ANSWERED SO HONESTLY.
I GOTTA SAY TO YOU THAT I
THOUGHT YOU EMBODIED WHAT THE
WHOLE PREMISE WAS ABOUT.
WE TAKE DIFFERENT QUALITIES THAT
IS OUR CURRENCY IN LIFE.
YOU HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM
THIS IN TERMS OF HOW I USE MY
BEAUTY TO GET IN A DOOR, AND
THEM IT'S WHAT I DO WHEN THAT
DOOR OPENS THAT MATTER?
 THE BEAUTY, IT DOESN'T PROPEL
ME THROUGH THE ENTIRE, YOU KNOW,
EXPERIENCE.
BUT IT DEFINITELY HELPS GETTING
MY FOOT IN THE DOOR.
AND IT'S UP TO MY MIND AND, YOU
KNOW, MY WITS TO, YOU KNOW,
CONTINUE WITH THAT AND SUCCEED.
 Jeff: I LOVED HOW CANDID
YOU WERE AT TRIBAL.
IT MADE FOR GREAT TRIBAL.
I HAVE TO SAY.
J'TIA, THE MORAL-- SO--
( APPLAUSE )
( BOOS )
J-TIA, THEY CAN BOO YOU.
I'D HAVE YOU BACK IN A SECOND.
 EXACTLY.
 Jeff: THE MORAL OF THE
STORY IS WHAT WITH YOU?
 DON'T TELL SOMEBODY THEY ARE
ABOUT TO BE VOTED OUT.
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GO
QUIETLY?
I'M GOING TO DUMP YOUR RICE.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
 Jeff: TIME TO GO TO ONE
MORE GUY, L.J.
WHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION?
I'LL SAY OF ALL THE GUYS THAT
WERE VOTED OUT EARLY, YOU WERE
PROBABLY THE GUY THAT MORE OF MY
WOMEN FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND
SAID, "OH, MAN.
L.J.'S GONE, WOW.
OF DID YOU GET A LOT OF FEMALE
REACTION?
 YEAH, I DID.
I GOT-- I GUESS JUST STARTED TO
SOCIAL MEDIA PROBABLY A WEEK
BEFORE I GOT VOTED OUT.
AND I WAS FUMBLING THROUGH --
 SO LIFE IS OKAY.
 YEAH, I'M NOT COMPLAINING
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: SO UP NEXT, IT'S OUR
29th SEASON.
FORTUNATELY, WE GET TO DO
ANOTHER ONE.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?
WE WILL SHOW YOU THAT WHEN WE
COME BACK.
( APPLAUSE )
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S TIME FOR THE CHECK
PREPARATION.
THAT IS A CHECK FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE A GREAT WINNER.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'VE BEEN
ON THE AIR FOR 14 YEARS AND 28
SEASONS.
AND I'M SO HAPPY TO SAY WE GET
TO DO IT AGAIN.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
TAKE A LOOK.
 HE'S MY BROTHER.
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT AGAINST
HIM.
 I GET ONE SHOT.
 LITERALLY FELT LIKE MY HEART
WAS BEING TORN OUT OF MY CHEST.
 I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM.
 BLOOD IS THICKER THAN
ANYTHING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: IT IS BLOOD VERSUS
WATER 2.
IF YOU WANT TO OWN A PIECE OF
"SURVIVOR" YOU CAN BID ON PROPS

CANCER."

CANCER OFF THE PLANET.
THE BIDDING STARTS AFTER THE
SHOW.

OF YOU GUYS.
