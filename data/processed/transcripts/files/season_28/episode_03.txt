         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
SURVIVOR, 18 NEW SURVIVORS
WERE DIVIDED INTO 3 TRIBES,
BRAWN VERSUS BRAIN VERSUS
BEAUTY AND IN 8 DAYS IT IS
ANYTHING IF PREDICTABLE.
AT THE BRAWN TRIBE TONY WENT
FROM PLAYING ALONE.
 I'M BY MYSELF, ME, MYSELF,
MY IDOL AND I.
NOW THERE ARE FOUR OF US.








 Jeff: TO BUILDING SEVERAL
DIFFERENT ALLIANCES.
 I GOT YOURING BA, I'M ALL
YOU GOT AND YOU'RE ALL I
GOT.
 Jeff: EVEN LYING TO A
FELLOW COP TO GET HIS WAY.
 THAT WAS A LIE.
JUST SO I COULD TRY TO GET
HER ON MY SIDE.
 Jeff: THE BRAIN TRIBE WAS
A DISASTER.
 HOW DID WE COME UP WITH
THE CRITERIA FOR BRAIN?








I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT
DATA.
 Jeff: AND FOR THE BEAUTY
TRIBE, NOTHING COULD GO
WRONG.
BUT AT THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE EVERYTHING
CHANGED.
 THE BEAUTY TRIBE IS
FALLING PART.
 Jeff: FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE BRAIN TRIBE DIDN'T LOSE.
 BRAIN TRIBE WINS
IMMUNITY.
 Jeff: AND THE BEAUTY
TRIBE LOST THEIR FIRST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL
JEREMIAH WAS CAUGHT IN
BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES,
ALEXIS, JEFRA AND LJ AND
BRICE AND PORE BEGAN.
 I'M OUT.
 AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, HE
SIDED WITH THE NUMBERS.
 .
 Jeff: THIRD PERSON VOTED
OU OF "SURVIVOR: CAGAYAN",
VOTING OUT BRICE AND LEAVING
MORGAN ALL ALONE AT THE
BOTTOM.
15 ARE LEFT WHO WILL BE
VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 IT TOOK A LOT OUT OF ME.
 I'M EMOTIONALLY PARALYZED
RIGHT NOW.
 I'M JUST PRETTY MAD AND
FRUSTRATED.
JEREMIAH IS JUST A LITTLE
COW ARD AND HE JUST
CHICKENED OUT.
HE CAME TO US AND THEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN HE JUMPED SHIP.
SO IT'S A HUGE POSSIBILITY
THAT I'M THE NEXT TO GO, I
GUESS, UNLESS I CAN SAVE
MYSELF.
 JEREMIAH, WHAT CHANGED
YOUR MIND?
YOU AND BRICE CAME TO ME
WITH THIS.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN TODAY
YOU WERE ALL BRICE.
I'M CONFUSED.
 MY FIRST ALLIANCE.
 I KIND OF GAVE HIM MY
WORD AND I FELT THAT WAS THE
BEST ROUTE FOR ME TO GO.
 BRICE OR --
 BRICE.
SCARED ME.
 MORGAN CONFRONTED ME IN
FRONT OF EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS ASKING ME WHAT
CHANGED MY MIND RIGHT IN
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.
THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW, IT'S
SURVIVOR, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A
MAJOR DECISION FOR ME
TONIGHT.
IT'S A NERVE-RACKING
DECISION, SO WE'LL SEE IF I
MADE A BONE HEAD PLAY OR NOT.
 I DON'T KNOW.
JEREMIAH-- UNTIL I GET LJ
OUT OF HERE, HE CAME TO ME
AND BRICE WAS LIKE HE IS MY
BIGGEST COMPETITION.
LIKE ALL THIS STUFF.
YOU KNOW, ME, LJ --
 HE'S THE TARGET.
 I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT
MORGAN IS PUTTING OUT THERE,
THAT JEREMIAH WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE
PLAN TO GET ME OUT.
BUT THE WAY SHE SAYS IT
SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT
REALISTIC.
SO I GOT TO KEEP MY EYES
OPEN FOR HIM.
JEREMIAH, I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK I PUT A BIG TARGET
ON HIS BACK AT THIS POINT
Captioning brought to you by
Survivor Productions, CBS
 MAIL.
 CAN YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A
LEADER?
CAN YOU SEE WHEN YOUR TRIBE
IS ABOUT TO FALL?
CAN YOU SEE WINNING SOME
PROTEIN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING AT ALL?
 SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
JUST A REWARD.
 LET'S SEE.
 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
CHALLENGE.
LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD
ON OUR WINNING STREAK.
WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW THAT WE
ARE ACTUALLY A TRIBE THAT
CAN PLAY THE GAME.
 PRACTICENESS WE CAN DO
THIS.
 GOT TO VISUALIZE IT NOW.
 CENTER.
 RIGHT.
 KEEP WALKING, STRAIGHT.
 HONESTLY I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING HOME LAST TIME AND THE
TIME BEFORE THAT.
I DUMPED THE RICE OUT, I'M
THE REASON WHY WE'RE HUNGRY.
 LEFT.
 I REALLY WANT TO HELP
THEM WIN FOOD BECAUSE I PUT
US IN THIS FOOD SITUATION.
SO I'M GOING TO BE BUSTING
ASS IN THIS CHALLENGE.
 SLIGHT LEFT.
 COME ON GUYSlrC.
 BRAIN AND BRAWN TRIBE

REWARD CALL ENG?

 FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE ONE
PERSON WILL BE YOUR CALLER.
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL
BE BLINDFOLDED.
USING ONLY VERBAL COMMANDS,
THE CALLER WILL ADDRESS THE
PAIR OF BLINDFOLDED TRIBE
MEMBERS TO COLLECT FIVE
ITEMS.
EACH TIME YOU GET AN ITEM,
YOU GOT TO BRING IT BACK,
HOIST IT UP TO THE CALLER.
ONCE YOU COLLECTED ALL FIVE
ITEMS, THE CALLER WILL SEND
YOU OFF FOR ONE FINAL TRIBE
FLAG.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO GET
THEIR FLAG UP TO THE CALLER

NORMALLY I WOULD ASK IF YOU
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE

HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT
DOW WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

ENJOY YOUR EGGS.
BRAIN TRIBE, MASSIVE BLOWN
OPPORTUNITY.
SPENCER, YOU COULDN'T GET
YOUR-- UP FAST ENOUGH IN
DISGUST.
 IT IS FRUSTRATING.
WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WE EXPECTED TO WIN SO IT'S A
HUGE LETDOWN.
 Jeff: BRAIN TRIBE, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU, GRAB YOUR
STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 ITS REWARD CHALLENGE.
THISES WITH A FUN ONE.
IT PICKED UP THE GROUP A
LITTLE BIT AND KIND OF
BROUGHT US BACK THAT WE'RE
HERE TO WIN, TO COMPETE.
AND WE CAN WIN.
 THIS WAS A GOOD DAY,
Y'ALL.
 IT IS EASIER WHEN THE
TIDE IS RIGHT, SPEND SOME
TIME ON THE REEF TODAY, YOU
COULD HAVE PROTECTION
TONIGHT, SOMETHING SOLID IS
THE IDOL.
VERY HIDDEN, BUT NOT TOO
DEEP.
AND REQUIRES THAT YOU GET
WET.
 THE IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE.
 JEREMIAH REACHES IN THE
BAG AND HE'S FOUND A CLUE TO
THE IDOL.
UNFORTUNATELY EVERYBODY IS
STANDING THERE.
THE CLUE WAS SO PRECISE,
THANK GOD I HAVE IT BECAUSE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND
TODAY AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A GROUP IDOL AND IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM.
 I DON'T THINK WE'VE I'VE
EVER BEEN CLOSE TO A LIVE
CHICKEN.
 DOES THE ROOSTER HAVE TO
GET IT ON WITH ONE OF THE
HENS TO MAKE EGGS.
 I WAS WONDERING THAT.
 NO.
 THE EGGS KEEP HAPPENING.
 YES.
 SO WHAT IS THE ROOSTER
FOR?
 THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK
ABOUT HOW THIS EGG CHECK
ENPROCESS WORKS.
BUT I REALLY THINK EVERYONE
IS JUST PRETENDING TO KNOW
AND THEY DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE THEY'RE --
 WHAT MAKES THEM MAKE
EGGS.
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE
IN A THING LIKE A-- HEAT
LAMP.
 NOBODY KNOWS HOW A CHECK
ENIS BORN.
I JUST-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT
SOME OF THIS STUFF COMES OUT
PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
 OH, SO LIKE ANOTHER --
 OH.
 WE HAVE THE STEREOTYPICAL
BEAUTY TRIBE.
AND IT IS JUST SO
UNFORTUNATE.
 ALL I KNOW IS IT TASTES
REALLY GOOD.
 WE ALL KNOW THE EGG CAME
FIRST BECAUSE DINOSAURS HAD
EGGS.
THEY WERE BEFORE THE CHICKEN
SO --
 YOU ARE GOING TO BE TASTY,
I'M SORRY.
YOU DO THE HONORS OR YOU
WANT ME TO DO IT.
 YOU ALL ARE GOING TO DO
IT.
 JUST IN CASE.
 IT'S KIND OF TOUGH
BECAUSE AFTER TRIBAL I GOT
TO DO MY-- KIND OF STAY JUST
A LITTLE BIT ON THEIR GOOD
SIDE.
I'M TRYING TO STEP UP AND
TRY TO DO AS MUCH AS I CAN.
 OH GOD.
> OH MY GOD.
 IS THAT HIS HEAD IS OFF.
 IT KIND OF RIPPED OFF.
 CHICK HE ENS DON'T NEED A
BRAIN TO FUNCTION.
THAT WAS GROSS.
 JEREMIAH YOU WEARING THAT
LIKE YOU DONE THAT A TIME OR
TWO.
 I HOPE I EARNED SOME
MAJOR POINTS, I MAY HAVE
BEEN RAISED IN THE COUNTRY
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CHICKENS.
I'M A MODEL.
 JEREMIAH KILLED THE
CHICKEN THAT IS COOL, I GET
TO EAT IT NOW.
I APPRECIATE IT.
 THIS IS THE BEST IDEA WE
HAVE HAD SINCE WE'VE BEEN
HERE.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I
STILL DON'T LIKE JEREMIAH AT
ALL.
HE IS A BIG FAT LIAR.
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY HE IS ON THIS TRIBE.
I DON'T THINK HE IS THAT
BEAUTIFUL AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A BEAUTIFUL TRIBE.
 IT HAS TO STICK TOGETHER.
 OF COURSE WE'RE GOING
HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.
SOONER OR LATER THERE'S
GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME --
 NO OFFENSE, YOU ARE A
DUDE, YOU AREN'T VERY
EMOTIONAL.
 OH, COME ON.
 NO, I DON'T.
 THEY ARE SO TIGHT.
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ME,
OVERTONEE.
IF YOU MESS WITH ME, I WILL
MESS WITH YOU WAY WORSE.
AND SO I JUST, I WANT TO GET
CLIFF OUT.
 THE THING IS LIKE HE
DOESN'T NEED THE MONEY.
 HEY.
 AND IF WE LOSE, HIM NEXT?
 THAT'S A BIG MOVE THAT
NEEDS TO BE MADE IN THE
GAME.
 WE'RE YOUNG.
 I AGREE.
 YOU SURPRISED ME THAT HE
WOULD FLIP ON CLIFF.
HE JUST HAS THIS LAXIDASICAL
DEMEANOR ABOUT HIM.
 ME TOO.
 YOU WANT TO WIN BAD
ENOUGH, IT'S JUST A FEELING.
IT'S A VIBE BUT I THINK
WE'RE SOLID.
 I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THE
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET TO
KNOW IS SO MUCH GRANDER.
 THAN HIM.
 HE'S GOT THAT ANGLE.
 I LOOK UP TO CLIFF IN A
BIG WAY, HE'S A BASKETBALL
SUPERSTAR.
I HAVE BEEN OY DOLLIZING FOR
A LONG TIME.
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE FOR ONE
OF US TO ACHIEVE THAT
MILLION DOLLAR SUCCESS OTHER
THAN CLIFF.
 WHEN YOU SAY HIS NAME,
THAT MEANS IT'S TIME.
 HEY, LET'S COUNT ON IT,
ALL RIGHT.
 I'M JUST TRYING TO
AFFILIATE MYSELF WITH THE
MAJORITY.
AND WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS
PRESENTED TO ME, I GOT TO
TAKE IT.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY I
WANT --
 I AGREE.
 TONY.
 I SAW WOO AND, SR. A
WHISPERING SOMETHING.
WHAT IS GOING ON.
SO I GO UP TO THEM AND THEY
LOOK LIKE THIS.
LIKE A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS AS
SOON AS I WALKED UP.
I PULLED HIM TO THE SIDE
WHAT IS GOING ON.
 ARE YOU SURE?
 I AM POSITIVE.
 A FEW DAYS AGO I WENT TO
SARAH AND I FED HER A LIE
THAT I HEARD CLIFF AND
LINDSEY TALKING ABOUT HER.
FROM THAT MOMENT ON I THINK
I CHANGED THE GAME BY HAVING
HER ON MY SIDE SO I BELIEVE
NOW THAT SHE'S PART OF MY
ALLIANCE.
 YOU TELL ME THE TRUE
THING, I'M TRUST ON THE
STRENGTH OF YOUR WORD.
IF YOU TELL ME TRUTHFUL BUT
I DON'T TRUST HIM.
 AS FAR A SAR IS A
CONCERNED WOO IS ON HER SIDE
SO I BELIEVE HE'S THEN ON MY
SIDE SO WE'RE IN AN A FLINS
OF FOUR AGAINST CLIFF AND
LINDSEY.
 EVERYTHING I LOVE.
 MY BACK ON YOU.
 SHE HAD ME SWEAR ON MY
BADGE WHICH THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING TO ME SWEARING
ON PIE BADGE.
I'M HERE TO LIE, CHEAT AND
STEAL, WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO
I'M GOING DO, AS SIMPLE AS
THAT.
 COPS AT THE END YOU HAVE
NEVER SEEN THAT.
 CHECK THIS OUT.
 STRANDED ON AN ISLAND.
IT'S ALWAYS SINK OR SWIM.
TODAY YOU CAN'T SINK THE
SHARK, TRIBAL COUNCIL COULD
BE GRIM.
 TAKE THE SHOT, BABY.
TAKE THE SHOT.
 WE HAVE AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE TODAY.
AND IT MIGHT BE BASKETBALL.
SO I'M SURE EVERYBODY IS
GOING TO EXPECT ME TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE THE BASKETS
BECAUSE I DID PLAY
BASKETBALL.
 SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
 18 YEARS IN THE NBA, I
WAS IN THE TOP TEN OF ANY
PLAYER THAT EVER PLAYED IN
THE NBA IN GAMES PLAYED.
I PLAYED MORE GAMES THAN
MICHAEL JORDAN, MAGIC
JOHNSON, LARRY BIRD.
SO HOPEFULLY IT'S A WALK IN
THE PARK.
 THIS IS THE-- FIRST OF
ALL, LINDSEY WON'T COMPETE.
SO ME, YOU AND WOO CAN
EASILY THROW THIS.
 I ALWAYS SENSED I WOULD
NEVER THROW A CHALLENGE
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
 HOWEVER WE CANNOT RISK
MERGING INTO TWO TRIBES AND
HAVING CLIFF STILL HERE.
 I'VE NEVER FLOWN ANYTHING,
THAT'S SUCH A WEIRD FEELING
FOR ME.
BUT COY DO T TRUST ME.
 I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID
LIKE WHY GET RID OF NUMBERS
BUT HE'S NOT OUR NUMBER.
THAT'S WHY.
IT'S HIM AND LINDSEY.
 I HEARD CLIFF WANTS ME
OUT.
AND SO I'M SCREWED IF CLIFF
IS STILL HERE.
IF IT LOOKS OBVIOUS LIKE
WE'RE THROWING IT, WHO CARES
BECAUSE HE'S GOING.
THE PROBLEM IS JUST
GOING-- GETTING WOO ON BOARD.
 TRISHA IS ON BOARD WITH
THAT.
 WHAT IF WE END UP MERGING.
 THROWING A CHALL SENG NOT
SMART.
SOME OF THESE GUYS MIGHT
WANT TO.
BUT CLIFF AND I HAVE BEEN
EXTREMELY CLOSE.
AND I CAN JUST PICTURE IT
NOW.
SHOOTING BASKETS.
LOOK AT THE JUMP SHOT, IT IS
UNDENIABLE.
ALONGSIDE WITH PIE BUDDY
CLIFF BUT THAT'S NOT HOW THE
MAJORITY OF MY CORE ALLIANCE
FEELS.
SO WHAT DO I DO.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: ARE YOU GUYS READY
TO GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
 YUP.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
WALK THE IDOLS OVER AND TOSS
THEM TO ME.
SPENCER, ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO DIVE DOWN AND
RE-- RELEASE A BUOY.
 YOU HAVE IT YOU BRING IT
BACK AND THE NEXT PERSON
GOES.
ONCE YOU COLLECTED ALL FIVE
BUOYS YOU WILL THROW THOSE
BUOYS INTO YOUR BASKET.
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO GET
ALL FIVE BUOYS IN THEIR
BASKET WINS IMMUNITY.
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSER GOES TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
BRAWN, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA

NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE
BRAWN TRIBE.
BRAIN, BIG EFFORT, CAME UP A
LITTLE SHORT.
TRIBAL COUNCIL ONCE AGAIN
WHERE ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 DUDE, WE TRIED SO HARD TO
BLOW THAT CHALLENGE.
SERIOUSLY, BRAIN TRIBE, I
TRIED TO HELP YOU OUT.
BUT THAT TEAM SUCKS.
THEY DESERVE TO LOSE AFTER
THAT.
THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY.
 KICKED BUTT.
 KICKED BUTT.
 I MEAN I'M DISAPPOINTED
NOT AT ANY ONE PERSON.
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED WE
LOST.
 I DO FEEL A BIT GYPPED
THAT I HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL WHEN I'M DOING VERY
WELL IN THE CHALLENGES AND
IT'S REALLY MY TEAM THAT'S
DOING POORLY IN THE
CHALLENGES.
 SPENCER, YOU ROCKED IT.
 YEAH, YOU KILLED ON THIS
ONE.
 IT WAS JUST SO CLOSE.
 IT WAS SUPERCLOSE.
 THE WORST PART ABOUT
BEING ON THIS TRIBE IS THE
GIRLS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN
PUTTING THEMSELVES IN A
POWER POSITION.
THE PROBLEM IS BY DOING THAT,
THEY'VE RUN THE TRIBE INTO
THE GROUND.
 J'TIA KEEPS MESSING UP IN
CHALLENGES.
 IT'S BEYOND FRUSTRATING.
SO HISTORY'S DEFINITELY NOT
IN MY FAVOR.
 I'M A GOOD IN CHALLENGES.
YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR.
 YES.
 I THINK THAT J'TIA IS
POOR ASSET IN CHALLENGES.
IF WE KEEP LOSING AND WE GE
GET-- WE ARE ALL IN TROUBLE
YOU KNOW.
 EXACTLY.
 I THINK THE BEST WAY TO
HELP US WIN IS TO GET HER.
 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE
PATTING PIE BACK ON THE WAY
OUT THE DOOR OR ACTUALLY
TRYING TO BRING ME BACK TOO
THE FOLD.
 YOU CAN'T TRY ANY LOGIC
TO GETTING RID OF SPENCER.
 AT THIS POINT NO, AT THIS
POINT NO.
 IF I COULD, I WOULD.
 PROBABLY, J'TIA JUST
CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
 RIGHT.
 WE CAN'T WIN WITH HER.
 YES, WE'LL GET PICKED OFF
ONE BY ONE IF WE DO NOT HAVE
THE STRONGEST TRIBE AND
THAT'S YOU, SPENCER AND I.
 I'M HAPPY WITH OUR
DECISION.
GET RID OF J'TIA.
IT MAKES SENSE.
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
WE HAVE A STRONG GUY WITH
US.
AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WE
KNOW HAS A PROPENSITY FOR
FAILURE.
 I DON'T WANT TO TELL HIM
HE'S SAFE.
 NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 I WANT TO PLAY IT LIKE
IT'S HIM.
 I WANT TO J'TIA TO FEEL
SUPERSAFE.
 I'M STILL PISSED ABOUT
THE RICE.
 IT IS HARD BECAUSE I LIKE
SPENCER.
 IF WE HAVE A MERGE OR
SOMETHING, HE'LL FLIP WITH
THE MEN.
 IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO
TRUST PEOPLE, AT SOME POINT
IN THE GAME YOU HAVE TO
TRUST SOMEONE.
AND I DON'T TRUST SPENCER.
 PIE BIG THING IS I'M
LOYAL.
BUT I THREW RICE IN THE
FIRE.
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING ON WITH
MY FINGERNAILS LEAK THE CAT
ON THE POSTER.
HANG IN THERE, THAT'S ME.
SO MY BEST BET NOW IS TO
HOPE MY ALLIANCE STICKS.
 IF THERE IS A SWAP
TOMORROW, I TRUST YOU GUYS
MORE THAN --
 LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE GONE
TO BAT FOR ME AND WHATEVER,
IF WE GET MIXED UP, HOWEVER,
I GOT YOU TOO.
 I BELIEVE THAT.
I FEEL THAT WAY MORE THAN --
 INITIALLY MY THOUGHTS
WERE TO VOTE J'TIA OUT BUT I
BELIEVE J'TIA IS A LOYAL
PERSON.
 THANK YOU, LADIES AND YOU
NEVER KNOW, JEFF COULD THROW
A CURVE BALL IN THIS GAME
WHERE YOU NEED A LOYAL
PERSON.
THAT IS SOMETHING TO
CONSIDER THE QUESTION IS ARE
WE IN THIS GAME TO WIN
CHALLENGES OR TO GO AS FAR
AS WE CAN GO WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE LOYAL.
 IF THERE IS A MIX UP, I
GUARANTEE YOU WE CAN COUNT
ON J'TIA.
 THE INTERESTING THING
ABOUT TOSHA, SHE IS LIKE A
PENDULUM, OVER HERE ONE
MINUTE, OVER HERE T MIGHT
CHANGE AGAIN BEFORE TRIBAL
FIVE TIMES.
 AND I WANT TO LET HER GO
BUT THEN I STOP AND THINK
FOR THE LONGEVITY OF THIS
GAME IS IT THE WISEST THING
TO DO.
I WANTED TO TALK IT OUT WITH
YOU BECAUSE I COULD BE
TOTALLY OFF, KASS.
 IT'S A RISK, EITHER WAY.
 TOSHA CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT IT TO ME JUST MAKE A
DECISION AND LIVE WITH IT.
BUT THAT'S MY LIFE.
I HAVE TO MAKE DECISION FOR
PEOPLE AND LIVE WITH THEM
ALL THE TIME.
SO AM I THE HATCHET MAN NOR
J'TIA OR SPENCER.
I CAN LIVE WITH EITHER
DECISION.
EITHER ONE IS THE SAME
GAMBLE TO ME BECAUSE I CAN'T
PREDICT WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN TOMORROW
.
 Jeff: SO J'TIA WHERE DOW
FIT IN THIS GROUP IN TERMS
OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES.
 HONESTLY, TODAY IN THE
WATER, I DID THE ABSOLUTE
BEST I COULD.
SO REALLY-- IN HIGH STRESS
INFORMATIONS I USUALLY RISE
TO THE TOPMENT I DO THINK I
HAVE PHYSICALITY.
THAT IS NOT ME.
SWIMMING IS JUST NOT MY
THING.
 Jeff: TOSHA, DOES THAT
RING TRUE TO YOU THAT J'TIA
HAS BEEN WEAK ONCE, WHICH IS
TODAY.
 NO, J'TIA HAS BEEN WEAK
IN MOST OF THE CHALLENGES,
JEFF.
WHEN WE GO INTO THE
CHALLENGES, WE DO HAVE TO
FIND A ROLE FOR HER THAT IS
THE MOST MINIMAL ROLE.
 Jeff: J'TIA WHAT DOES
THAT FEEL LIKE TO HEAR FROM
SOMEBODY WHO IS SAYING IF WE
COULD GET RID OF THE WEAK
LINK IT WOULD BE J'TIA.
 I THINK I HAVE BEEN THE
WEAKEST IN CHALLENGES.
I DON'T THINK SHE SAID I WAS
THE WEAK LINK, THAT'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE.
IN SURVIVOR IT'S NOT JUST
OUTPLAY, IT'S ALSO OUTWIT,
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THAT.
 Jeff: ALTHOUGH YOU LEFT
ONE ASPECT OUT WHICH IS YOU
HAVE TO LAST LONG ENOUGH TO
OUTLAST THE OTHERS AND AT
THE RATE YOU'RE GOING, NONE
OF YOU WILL BE THERE AT THE
END.
 NO.
 Jeff: THAT'S REALLY THE
DILEMMA, ISN'T IT, TOSHA.
 THAT IS THE DECISION.
DO WE GO WITH OUR STRONG
CHALLENGE MEMBER,
EXPERIENCER WHO KICKED ME
OUT OF THE ALLIANCE WITH HE
AND GARRETT OR DO WE GO WITH
THE PERSON WHO HAS PROVEN
HER LOYALTY.
 Jeff: KASS, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT
J'TIA THREW OUT 95% OF YOUR
RICE INTO A FIRE.
 I LOOK AT THE FIRE AND
THE RICE INCIDENT AS AN
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE, NOT AS A
SIGN OF DISLOYALTY.
I JUST THINK SHE'S A HOT
HEAD.
BUT I GET HER.
I MEAN I WAS A HOT HEAD TOO.
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M
NOT LOYAL IT JUST MEANS I
MAKE SOME BAD DECISIONS.
 Jeff: THE PROBLEM WITH
BAD DECISIONS IS THEY CAN
COST YOU A MILLION DOLLARS
IN THIS GAME.
 RIGHT, TONIGHT I MAY MAKE
A REALLY BAD DECISION.
THAT WEIGHS ON ME HEAVILY
RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: SO SPENCER, HOW
DOES THIS SIT WITH YOU?
 WELL, I MEAN I THINK THE
RICE DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR
HER.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU DO HAVE
SIGNS OF LOYALTY BUT
UNPREDICTABILITY IS JUST AS
DANGEROUS AS DISLOYALTY AT
TIMES.
I'M TO THE GOING TO MAKE A
DUMB MISTAKE LIKE THAT AND I
WILL BE WITH THIS GROUP
GOING FORWARD.
 YOU SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE
SO I MEAN --
 RIGHT, AND I THIRX I MEAN
I CAN'T GET AROUND THAT I
WAS THE BONE HEAD WHO WAS ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE VOTE
LAST TIME.
 Jeff: J'TIA ARE YOU AND
SPENCER AWAY THAT WHILE
YOU'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
THAT KASS AND TOSHA ARE
TALKING TO EACH OTHER.
 I HEAR THEM WHISPERING IN
FRONT OF ME.
I KNOW WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT
BEFORE WE CAME HERE.
I HOPE THAT THE ALLIANCE CAN
STAND.
 Jeff: SPENCER, THEY JUS
JUST-- NODDING.
 IT'S CRAZY AS A VIEWER, I
THINK I WOULD LOVE IT RIGHT
HERE, RIGHT NOW.
IT'S PRETTY SCARER.
 Jeff: KASS, YOU SEEM TO
BE ENJOYING THIS.
 I LOVE SURVIVOR.
SO LIKE IF YOU ARE'S SITTING
WATCHING THIS, I'M THE ONE
GOING DON'T DO SOMETHING
STUPID, TOSH, DON'T DO
SOMETHING STUPID, KASS.
BUT WHAT IS STUPID?
 Jeff: THAT'S THE
QUESTION.
 THAT IS THE QUESTION
RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: SO LOOK AT YOU,
SPENCER WHAT DOES THAT FEEL
LIKE AS A SUPERFAN OF THE
SHOW AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET
A CHANCE TO REALLY PLAY.
 I MEAN IT'S DEVASTATING.
AND RIGHT NOW I WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO AVOID THAT, YOU
KNOW.
 Jeff: TOSH IS NOT EVEN
LISTENING TO YOU.
SHE'S LOOKING AT KASS AN
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT'S
THE DECISION.
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
 WELL, I WANT TO SAY THAT
I'M LOYAL TO YOU TWO.
I WANT TO HELP YOU GUYS WIN
CHALLENGES.
AND YOU KNOW, ALL I'M ASKING
FOR IS A CHANCE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT T IS TIME
TO VOTE.
KASS YOU'RE UP.
 I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS
NERVOUS IN MY LIFE.
I KNOW IS EITHER YOU AND ME
SO IT'S REALLY NO DECISION.
 I'VE BEEN LIVING IN
BORROWED TIME SINCE I
SPILLED THAT RICE.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE
TIME TO DO SO.
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES
ARE READ THE DECISION IS
FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TROIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, J'TIA.
SPENCER.
J'TIA.
THAT'S TWO VOTES J'TIA.
ONE VOTE SPENCER.
ONE VOTE LEFT.
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: CAGAYAN", J'TIA,
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.
 GOOD LUCK, YOU GUYS.
 THANK YOU.
 THANKS.
 Jeff: J'TIA, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR TO YOU GO.
 WELL, FOR ALL THE UPS AND
DOWNS OF THIS TRIBE, THE ONE
THING THAT HAS REMAINED
CONSISTENT IS YOUR
UNPREDICTABILITY.
HOPEFULLY THIS NEW TRIBE
CONFIGURATION WILL BRING YOU
SOME STABILITY BECAUSE YOU
NEED IT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 THE BRAIN TRIBE IS --
 HOW MY TEAM PLAYED THIS
GAME IS RIDICULOUS...r
THE CRAP FOR BRAIN TRIBE.
 BUT A TWIST BRINGS NEW
LIFE.
 BRAINS, BRAWN AND BEAUTY
IS NO MORE.
 I'M NOT SURPRISED THEY
VOTED ME OUT.
I THREW ALMOST ALL OF THEIR
RICE AWAY AND WAS WEAK IN
THE CHALLENGES.
THOSE ARE TWO REALLY GOOD
REASONS TO VOTE ME OUT.
WHAT YOU CAN SAY.
I FEEL TWO WAYS ABOUT IT I
WISH THEM THE BEST OF LUCK
AND HALF OF ME HOPES THEY
STARVE.
BUT SO IS LIFE.
YOU LIVE AND LEARN, YOU MAKE
MISTAKES.
YOU GROW.
I'M JUST GOING TO GROW
OUTSIDE THE GAME.
