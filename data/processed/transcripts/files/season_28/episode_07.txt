 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"...
 YOUR TRIBES ARE MERGED.
 APARRI AND SOLANA FINALLY
MERGED.
 ANOTHER IDOL WITH POWERS IS
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE NEAR YOUR CAMP.
 Jeff: AND A NEW IDOL WITH
DIFFERENT POWERS WAS PUT IN
PLAY.
 IT'S POWERFUL ENOUGH ON ITS








OWN, BUT NOW SPECIAL POWERS.
 Jeff: THE REAL STRUGGLE FOR
POWER WAS BETWEEN ALLIANCES.
 THERE'S A GROUP OF FIVE, AND
THERE'S A GROUP OF SIX THAT'S
HALF BRAIN AND HALF BEAUTY AND
SARAH.
 Jeff: AND SARAH WAS PLAYING
BOTH SIDES.
 I CAN GUARANTEE TONY.
 I GET TO DECIDE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW.
 BUT KASS HAD OTHER PLANS.
 NO ONE IN THIS GAME SHOULD








HAVE THAT MUCH POWER WHOM MADE
HER QUEEN?
 Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL... WHERE DO IDOLS COME
INTO PLAY?
 THERE'S IDOL, CAUSE I GOT
ONE.
 Jeff: SARAH COULD ONLY
WATCH AS HER GAME UNRAVELED.
 'D LIKE THE GIVE IT TO L.J.
 Jeff: HER CONTROL TURNED
INTO CHAOS.
PIEFD LIKE THE COVER TONY'S ASS
MYSELF.
 THIS IS ALSO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 Jeff: SHE WENT FROM THE
QUEEN...
 SARAH.
 Jeff: TO THE FIRST MEMBER
OF THE JURY.
SARAH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 KASS, ZERO CHANCE OF WINNING
THE GAME.
 LONG WAY TO GO.
.
 Jeff: TEN ARE LEFT WHOM
WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 NICE JOB, GUYS.
 WELL PLAYED.
 THAT WAS A COOL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 WE LOST TWO IDOLS.
 TRIBAL WAS INSANE.
WE VOTED FOR JEFRA.
SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME.
WE DODGED THESE IDOLS.
IT IS ALL FOR NOTHING BECAUSE
KASS FLIPPED AND WE'RE SCREWED.
 I EXPECT EVERYBODY TO BE MAD.
 I'M NOT PERSONALLY MAD.
I'M NOT UPSET.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU I THINK IT
BECAUSE MOVE.
 KASS WILL FLY IN THE FACE OF
STRATEGY JUST BECAUSE HOWEVER
SHE FEELS.
SHE'LL GO BASICALLY WHEREVER HER
ESTROGEN TAKES HER, NOT WHERE
HER BRAIN TAKES HER.
 WE TALKED ABOUT...
 THAT'S HOW I'M PLAYING.
 I'M WELL AWARE IS ALL YOU'RE
PLAYING IS YOUR GUT.
 I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL COVER ME
A LITTLE BIT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THE ALLIANCE OF SIX LET ME GO
TO THE BOTTOM.
THE NUMBER-ONE RULE IN SURVIVOR
ISN'T CATER TO THE PERSON ON
TOP.
IT'S WONDER ABOUT THE PERSON ON
THE BOTTOM.
 WHEN THEY SIT BACK AND THINK
ABOUT WHAT THEY DID...
 WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
 YOU'VE NEVER EVEN TALKED TO
ME.
 WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF
KASS?
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
 YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN
THIS GAME TO PISS PEOPLE OFF.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN IT.
 KASS, YOU TALKING STRATEGY,
JUST STOP.
PLEASE.
 REALLY?
 PLEASE STOP.
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT.
 YOU GUYS STRATEGIZE.
 IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT.
SERIOUSLY.
 IT'S CALLED PLAYING THE GAME,
SPENCE.
IT'S LIKE I PULLED OFF A HAT
TRICK ON SURVIVAL.
I GOT RID OF THE GIRL I WANTED
TO GET RID OF AND TWO BIG LUGS
PLAYED THEIR IDOLS
UNNECESSARILY.
TRIPLE WIN, RIGHT?
 SHE'S BEEN WITH US SINCE DAY
ONE.
SHE'S A FRICKEN IDIOT.
 I'M FINE WITH IT.
I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE
MAD.
SO I PISSED OFF FIVE PEOPLE, BUT
I GAINED FIVE FRIENDS.
THE PISSED-OFF PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO GET OVER IT, SO I DON'T HAVE
AN ALLIANCE.
I AM A FREE AGENT.
EVERYONE'S MAD I MESSED UP THEIR
GAME, BECAUSE I'M PLAYING MY
GAME.
 I'M GOING TO GET SOME WATER
TODAY.
 YOU WANT SOME HELP?
 YEAH.
 NOR GANN, NO GOOD ON THE
WATER?
 I CAN GET WATER, BUT I DON'T
SEE HOW HER SAYING IT IN A RUDE
WAY.
 EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO SAY
TO YOU IS GOING TO BE IN A RUDE
WAY SINCE YOU'VE BEEN RUDE TO
ME.
 I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING TO
YOU.
 YEAH, YOU HAVE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 IT'S FOR ALL OF US ANYWAY.
 I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT
MORGAN IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.
SHE'S LIKE AN OLD DOG.
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A 14-YEAR-OLD
DOG YOU'RE KEEPING ALIVE BECAUSE
YOU LOVE IT.
YOU DON'T MIND IT PEES ON THE
FLOOR, BUT ALL IT REALLY DOES IS
SIT.
THERE THAT'S MORGAN.
 MORGAN, ARE YOU GOING TO GO?
JUST A MINUTE.
 KASS, SHE SAID THAT I'M BEING
REALLY MEAN TO HER.
I DON'T THINK I'M BEING MEAN TO
HER.
I'M IGNORING HER.
MAYBE THAT'S MEAN, BUT I THINK
SHE'S IGNORED AND MADE FUN OF
ALL HER LIFE, SO SHE SHOULD BE
USED TO THIS.
KASS, I FEEL LIKE SHE'S JUST A
BITTER, UGLY OLD LADY AND THIS
SOUNDS REALLY CONCEITED.
I THINK SHE HATES ME BECAUSE I'M
CUTER THAN HER AND I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN CUTER THAN HER.
SCASES STUPID.
SHE NEEDS TO GO AND I'LL MAKE
SURE OF IT.
Captioning brought to you by

 CONGRATULATION, YOU GUYS.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
JEREMIAH, JEFRA, L.J., MORGAN,
SPENCER, WELL-EARNED.
ENJOY IT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.
KASS, LOU, TONY, TASH, YEAH
TRISH, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 PARTY TIME.
HEY, YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE
SOME.
 DOUBLE THE RICE, THROW SOME
COCONUT IN AND IT'S PARTY.
 I AM SO PISSED OFF THIS WE
DIDN'T WIN THAT CHALLENGE WHEN
WE COULD HAVE EATEN A JUICY
STEAK, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
SAY, BETTER TO BE PISSED OFF
THAN BE PISSED ON.
 ARE YOU GUYS WORRIED ABOUT
SPENCER MORE THAN JEREMIAH?
 WELL, HE IS A INFLUENTIAL
PERSON WITH HIS MOUTH.
JEREMIAH'S JUST QUIET AND JUST
DOES HIS THING PHYSICALLY.
 SPENCER IS GOOD IN CHALLENGE,
TOO.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE THE
DECIDING PERSON.
 WELL, YOU KNOW THEM MORE THAN
WE DO.
YOU KNOW WHO IS INFLUENTIAL, WHO
IS EFFECTIVE, WHO IS MALICIOUS.
 I'M NOT EVEN IN AN ALLIANCE.
I'M STILL A FREE AGENT.
NO ONE HAS SAID, KASS, YOU'RE
IN, BUT THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION
I'M NEW YORK AND ALREADY TONY
AND TRISH SAID, WHO WOULD YOU
WANT GONE NEXT?
I SAID, I DON'T CARE AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT ME.
I WANT TO REINFORCE THAT, SO
THERE IS A COMFORT LEVEL WHEN I
COME IN FOR THE KILL.
 I'M NOT A FLIPPER.
I DON'T CONSIDER IT A FLIP.
I DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
 A MOVE.
 YEAH.
WHAT IF I MADE A MISTAKE, SO
WHAT.
 ARE YOU HAPPY WHAT YOU DID?
 EFEEL GOOD.
 THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
 I THINK WE'RE ALL GOOD FOR A
COUPLE MORE.
 KASS IS TELLING ME HOW SHE'S
GOING TO BE SOLID WITH US.
SHE SEEMS SINCERE.
SHE'S HARD TO READ BECAUSE SHE
DOESN'T HAVE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
LIKE A STONE FACE.
I CAN'T TELL WHETHER SHE'S LYING
TO ME OR NOT AND I'M A POLICE
OFFICER.
I'M HOPING SHE STAYS US WITH,
BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO PREPARE
FOR THE WORST.
 WHERE DO WE BEGIN TO LOOK?
WHERE DO WE LOOK?
 LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL, L.J.
AND I PLAYED IDOL, BUT THERE IS
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WITH
SPECIAL POWERS AROUND CAMP.
THAT'S A NEEDLE IN HAYSTACK.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING BUT TIME ON
THIS ISLAND, SO I WENT OUT THERE
AND STARTED LOOKING IN TREE
HOLE, CLIMBING TREES, I'M DOING
ALL KINDS OF STUFF BECAUSE I
NEED TO FIND THAT IDOL.
IT'S SECURITY BLANKET THEY WOULD
LOVE TO COVER MYSELF WITH.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WELCOME.
 THANK YOU.
 HAVE A SEAT WHEREVER YOU
LIKE.
 WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED, WE
WERE GREETED BY A GRILLED
PINEAPPLE RITA, WHICH HAD BACON
IT.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING BAIBT CON
THIS WHOLE TIME, SO THAT WAS
AMAZING.
 TOMATO, FRESH TOMATOES.
 OH, MY GOSH.
 BEAUTIFUL.
 WE STARTED OFF WITH SALAD AND
THIS WAS HONESTLY THE BEST SALAD
I EVER HAD.
WE WENT ON THE LIKE A FULLY
LOADED BAKED POTATO AND THEN THE
STEAK WAS JUST AMAZING.
 I'LL TAKE ANOTHER STEAK FOR
SURE.
-STEAK WAS THE BEST THING I
TASTED PROBABLY EVER.
 I REALLY COULD NOT ASK FOR A
BETTER REWARD THAN THIS.
 I'M DONE.
 THANKS.
 CAN WE HAVE ONE OF EACH?
 YOU HAVE TWO SEPARATE
STOMACHS.
YOUR FORMAL FOOD STOMACH AND
YOUR DESERT STOMACH, SO YOUR
DESERT STOMACH IS STILL HUNGRY.
OUT HERE I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH
MANNERS.
I SAID, FORGET THE NAPKIN.
I'M EATING.
IT TAKES ABOUT UNTIL THE END OF
THE MEAL FOR ME TO REALIZE MY
HANDS ARE GROSS AND WIPE THEM
OFF.
I OPEN MY NAPKIN, AND OUT FALLS
A PIECE OF PAPER.
I WONDER WHAT THAT COULD BE.
SO I PUT IT IN MY POCKET BECAUSE
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SOME
KIND OF CLUE TO AN IDOL.
I NEED GAME CHANGER RIGHT NOW,
AND THIS COULD BE IT.
I GOAT CAMP, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
A DOWNPOUR COMES ON SOME I'M
JUST TRYING TO KEEP THIS THING
DRY.
TRIBAL COUNCIL ISN'T THAT FAR
AWAY.
SO TIME IS MONEY RIGHT NOW.
 TAKE THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED,
A HIKE BEYOND, A COURSE WHERE
RAIN ONCE JOURNEYED MEANS YOU
ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO TELL.
THIS IDOOL IS SURELY BURIED, BUT
YOU WON'T BE DIGGING DOWN, A
MESH OF ROOTS AND ROCK AND DIRT
HIDES MORE POWER THAN A CROWN.
 I THINK HE'S ON A WALK.
 I AM A BIG FAN OF SURVIVOR,
AND I NOW THAT WHEN THERE'S A
REWARD LIKE THE OUTBACK, THERE'S
USUALLY A CLUE TO THE IMMUNITY
IDOL.
ALL OF A SUDDEN SPENCER TAKES
OFF, SO WHAT DO I DO, I START TO
FOLLOW SPENCER.
I'M GOING TO PULL OUT SOMETHING
OUT OF MY ARSENAL, WHICH IS MY
NINJA STEALTH MODE.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'M GOING TO
BE LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.
HE'S DIGGING THROUGH A SIDE OF A
WALL, AND AUTOMATICALLY I'M
ASSUMING HE'S LOOKING FOR THE
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 YOU GOING FOR A WALK?
 YEAH.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH.

YOU?
 YEAH, I'M JUST TAKING A WALK
MYSELF.
 YOUR PANTS ARE OVER HERE.
 I GOT TO PICK UP HIS PANTS
AND AS SOON AS I DO, BOOM, OUT
POPS THE CLUE TO THE IDOL.
WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THAT CLUE
AND HAND IT BACK TO HIM, NO WAY
 YOU DROPPED SOMETHING OVER,
THERE, DUDE.
I HIGH TAIL IT SONIC THE
HEDGEHOG STYLE, I'M CRUISING
THROUGH THE PATCH, THERE NIECE
WAY HE'S CATCHING ME.
 HE BOLTED WITH THE CLUE, AND
THAT GUY CAN RUN.
I KNEW THAT PABD MOAN YUM WAS
ABOUT TO ENSUE.
I'M PISSED OFF.
 DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A
CLUE?
 NO.
 SPENCER.
 HE DID?
 I WENT CHASING AFTER HIM.
HE'S NOT FINDING ANYTHING.
I KNEW THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO
BE EASY FINDING THE IMMUNITY
IDOL BY MYSELF, SO IMMEDIATELY I
RUN TO CAMP AND I GO, L.J., YOU
GOT TO FLOAL ME, MAN.
AND THEN FROM THERE, THE SEARCH
PARTY IS ON.
 HE THREW MY PANTS IN THE
WATER AND TOOK THE CLUE FROM ME.
 I FOUND THE CLUE.
 DO YOU GUYS WANT TO HELP
LOOK.
I'LL TAKE YOU, LET'S GO.
 WHEN WOO RAN TO CAMP, I KNEW
IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO GET MY
TROOPS IN LINE AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.
 CAN YOU RUN?
 YEAH, I CAN RUN.
 IT'S RACE TO SEE WHO CAN GET
IT FIRST.
WOO TOOK IT FROM SPENCER'S
POCKET.
 YOU GUYS ARE SOMETHING ELSE.
 TAKE THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED.
 ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW WHERE THAT IS.
 IT'S A MAD TREASURE HUNT FOR
THIS IDOL.
AND YOU KNOW ME, I LOVE ACTION,
SO I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M IN, COUNT ME IN, WHICH WAY
IS THIS.
YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ALLIANCES
JUST LOOKING FOR AN IDOL AT THE
SAME TIME.
YOU KNOW IT'S BAD WHEN MORGAN,
THE GIRL THAT YOU CAN'T TELL
SHE'S A PILLOW OR A PERSON
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW IT'S SERIOUS WHEN SHE'S
UP ON HER AS AND SHE'S LOOKING
FOR THE TITLE.
 EVERYONE'S LOOKING.
IT'S A RACE TO SEE WHO FINDS IT
FIRST.
 IS EVERYONE LOOKING AT THIS
POINT?
 I WOULD SAY STRESS IS AT A
PEAK RIGHT NOW.
I'M IN BAD POSITION.
 DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN.
YOU KEEP DIGGING.
WE HAVE EVERYONE LOOKING FOR
THIS IDOL, AND IT'S LIKELY THAT
WHOEVER FINDS IT WILL FIND IT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
 KEEP ON EYE ON HIM.
I KNOW HE'S GOING TO GET L.J.
REAL QUICK.
 YEAH.
 FUNNY HOW OUR GAME HAS
DEVOLVED INTO THIS, ISN'T IT?
 I LOVE IT.
 IT IS A CRAZY GAME.
 I MEAN, I'M NOT NECESSARILY
DOWN WITH WITH OO DID, BUT I
THINK IT'S KARMA FOR YOUR
BEHAVIOR LAST NIGHT.
 I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR.
AFTER THIS WHOLE FIASCO WITH WOO
STEALING MY CLUE AND EVERYONE
GOING TO LOOK FOR THE IDOL AT
ONCE, I'M DIGGING AND I'M RIGHT
BY KASS AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
IS THE IDOL.
AND KASS IS WATCHING ME LIKE A
HAWK, SO I KEEP DIGGING AND
ACTING LIKE I HAVEN'T FOUND IT.
I WAIT UNTIL SHE'S NOT LOOKING,,
STUFF IT IN MY PANTS, WALK THE
OTHER WAY.
KASS IS SO BLIND THAT I FIND IT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF KASS' FACE AND
SHE DIDN'T SEE.
TODAY WAS COMPLETE YOU FORA.
I'M STILL SHOCKED THAT I FOUND
IT.
IT COULD NOT HAVE WORKED OUT
BETTER.
IF YOU USE THE IDOL, YOU MUST
REVEAL IT AFTER ALL THE VOTES
ARE CAST BUT BEFORE THE VOTES
ARE READ.
 MY POSITION IN THE GAME IS ON
THE BRINK OF ECSTASY AND
DEVASTATION ALL THE TIME, BUT
IT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED, AND I BOUGHT
MYSELF A LOT OF TIME
POTENTIALLY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
FIRST THINGS FIRST, WOO.
TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON YOUR TOES
WITH A BLOCK WEDGED BETWEEN YOUR
HEAD AND THE TOP OF THE FRAME.
THE LONGER THE CHALLENGE GOES,
THE MORE FATIGUED YOUR LEGS WILL
BECOME UNTIL THEY FINALLY GIVE
OUT AND THE BLOCK FALLS.
WHEN THE BLOCK FALLS, YOU'RE OUT
OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
LOSER, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION.
NOW I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU IN
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET
YOUR HANDS GO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE,
HANDS OFF THE FRAME.
EVERYBODY'S IN POSITION AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.
YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE FRAME.
KASS CAN'T LAST BUT A FEW
SECONDS.
SHE'S FIRST OUT.
YOU CAN HAVE A SPOT ON YOUR
FRAME.
JUST LIKE THAT WE'RE DOWN NINE.
TRISH WITH A NICE RECOVERY.
JEREMIAH OUT.
TRISH RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
WE LOSE TWO MORE.
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES, ONE SLIGHT
HESITATION, ONE LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT WITH YOUR HEAD AND JUST
LIKE THAT TONY DOES THE SAME
THING.
WE'RE DOWN SIX PEOPLE LEFT.
WE ARE WAY PAST THE POINT OF
DOES THIS HURT.
IT COMES DOWN WILLPOWER REALLY.
HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT IT?
HOW MUCH CAN YOU TAKE?
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN BUGS ARE
FLYING ON THEIR BODY.
THEY'RE ANNOYING, HOW ANNOYING?
ARE YOU GOING TO SWAT IT AWAY?
YOU'RE PROBABLY OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.
NICE RECOVERY BY SPENCER.
MORGAN LOSES HER BALANCE.
SHE'S OUT.
YOU CAN SEE THE PAIN NOW TRYING
TO STRETCH OUT THOSE LEGS, GET
THAT BLOOD CIRCULATING AGAIN.
WOO WITH A SLIGHT WOBBLE.
WOO TRIES TO RECOVER.
HE CANNOT.
WOO IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE AND
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
JUST A LITTLE PAIN.
YOU'VE ENDURED A LOT MORE IN 22
DAYS OF "SURVIVOR."
THE QUESTION IS: HOW MUCH MORE
CAN YOU TAKE?
I KNOW YOU'RE GETTING TIRED, AND
I KNOW THE PAIN IS INTENSE.
JEFRA FIGHTING THROUGH IT.
KEEP FIGHTING.
JEFRA, THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION.
MUSCLES ARE SO EXHAUSTED.
SHE CAN HARDLY GET DOWN FROM THE
FRAME.
YOU ALL RIGHT, JEFRA?
 YEAH, I'M GOOD.
 Jeff: NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHAT L.J. AND TASHA AND SPENCE
RER FEELING.
SOMEBODY IS EARNING THIS
IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
TASHA WITH A NICE RECOVERY.
L.J. CAN'T HANG ON.
L.J. FALLS OUT AND WE'RE DOWN TO
TWO, TASHA AND SPENCER IN A
SHOWDOWN FOR IMMUNITY.
IT COMES DOWN TO A QUESTION OF
WHO CAN OUTLAST THE OTHER.
I AM GENUINELY IMPRESSED THAT.
IS A LONG TIME TO BE HOLDING
THIS POSE.
TASH, YEAH NO CHANGE IN HER
FACIAL EXPRESSION.
SPENCER, AWKWARD-LOOKING BUT
VERY STRONG.
SPENCER HAS LOOKED PAINED THE
ENTIRE CHALLENGE.
GET IT BACK IN CONTROL, SPENCER.
KEEP DIGGING, TASHA.
SPENCER STRUGGLING TO HANG ON.
KEEP FIGHTING THROUGH IT.
SPENCER REALLY FIGHTING TO STAY
IN THIS.
TASHA OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS THE
BLOCK.
SPENCER WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.
HE'S SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
HUGE EFFORT FROM BOTH OF YOU.
SPENCER, CAN YOU WALK OVER HERE?
 I HOPE.
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.
 Jeff: SPENCER, SAFE AT
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 22
DAYS, SOMEBODY GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 GOOD FOR YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, MY FRIEND.
 SPENCER WAS VERY DESPERATE TO
WIN.
HE PULLED IT OFF.
THAT'S THE WILL YOU NEED OUT
HERE TO SURVIVE.
 KASS, DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
AN IDOL?
 MORGAN'S THE EASY ONE.
 THE FEAR IS THAT IF THEY DID
FIND THAT IDOL, YOU CAN'T TAKE A
GAMBLE AND PUTTING EVERYTHING ON
TASH UNLESS SHE COMES OUT WITH
SOMETHING, THEN ONE OF US GO
HOME.
 I UNDERSTAND.
 SO THE LEAST LIKELY PERSON TO
HAVE THE IDOL IS WHAT WE HAVE TO
THINK ACT.
MY PLAN WOULD BE TO GET RID OF
MORGAN.
IF THEY HAVE AN IDOL, THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO SHARE IT WITH HER.
PLEASE, EVERYBODY, LOOK AT HER.
 SHE DOES NEED TO GO.
SHE'S DEAD WEIGHT.
 TASH IS DEFINITELY A PHYSICAL
THREAT AND A SOCIAL THREAT.
BUT MORGAN DOES NOT DESERVE TO
BE HERE.
PEOPLE THAT WORK HARD, THAT BUST
THEIR AS AROUND CAMP, DESERVE TO
BE HERE.
PEOPLE LIKE MORGAN THAT DON'T DO
ANYTHING, THEY DON'T DESERVE TO
BE HERE.
 SO THAT'S PLAN "A."
NOW, PLAN "B," THEY COME UP WITH
SOME CRAZY NONSENSE, WHAT'S PLAN
"B"?
 AS FAR AS NUMBERS, MY
ALLIANCE IS IN A POWER POSITION.
IT'S SIX OF US AGAINST FOUR OF
THEM.
BUT IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT
SOUNDS.
THE PROBLEM WITH TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL WILL BE THAT IF
SPENCER FOUND THAT IDOL, IT WILL
BE VERY TRICKY ON WHO WE VOTE
FOR.
IF THEY HAVE AN IDOL AND WE VOTE
FOR THE PERSON WHO USES THE
IDOL, ONE OF US SIX IS GOING
HOME.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN IDOL AND
KASS FLIPS BACK WITH THEM, IT
WILL BE A TIE, 5, 5, WE DRAW
ROCK, ONE OF US GOES HOME.
I'M HOPING SHE STAYS WITH US.
IF SHE DOESN'T, IT'S GOING TO
CAUSE SOME TROUBLE.
 WHO ARE WE VOTING?
 KASS.
 NO, NO, SHE'S STILL THE ONLY
PERSON WHO WOULD EVEN CONSIDER
FLIPPING.
TONY JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A
LITTLE BIT OF CHANCE HE DOES
SOMETHING STUPID AT TRIBAL AND
SHE'LL CHANGE HER MIND AT THE
DROP OF HAT.
TONEY.
 IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS, BUT
OUR OPTION NOW IS KASS, THE
PERSON WHO JUST SCREWED US OVER
IS THE ONE PERSON WHO MIGHT BE
CRAZY ENOUGH TO HELP US.
I AM SAFE BECAUSE I WON
IMMUNITY, SO I KNOW THE IDOL
COULD HELP, BUT IT WOULD ONLY
WORK IF I HAD SOMEONE WHO WOULD
FLIP WITH IT.
SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO FLIP
COULD TELL WHITE HOUSE THEY'RE
GOING TO VOTE FOR, HELP ME USE
MY IDOL SUCCESSFULLY AND A
CHANGE IN THE DYNAMIC OF THE
GAME.
 IF YOU MADE A MOVE THAT WOULD
PUT YOU, AND THIS IS JUST
HYPOTHETICAL, I DON'T WANT TO
COME IN HERE AND TRY GIVE YOU
SOME SELL, BUT IF YOU MADE A
MOVE THAT MADE YOU WITH US, THEN
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LOST ALL OUR
JURY VOTES BECAUSE THE FINAL
WOULD INCLUDE TWO OF US AND
POTENTIALLY THE OTHER TWO WOULD
FEEL A LOT LESS BITTER.
 I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
JUST THE HUMAN IN YOU WANTS TO
FORGIVE SOMEONE AND BE FRIENDS
AGAIN, SO I WAS BANKING ON THAT
WHEN I MADE MY MOVE, THAT THE
FIVE PEOPLE I ALLEGEDLY BETRAYED
WOULD GET OVER IT BECAUSE THERE
WILL BE MANY MORE BETRAYALS.
 RIGHT NOW I'M NOT IN AN
ALLIANCE.
I CONSIDER MYSELF A FREE AGENT
KIND OF.
 THEN WOULD YOU CONSIDER IT?
 I'M GOING TO CONSIDER
EVERYTHING.
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING TO GET TO
THE FINAL THREE.
 SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IT OR JUST
MAYBE?
 YEAH, I WOULD.
 SO I THINK TONY'S A GOOD
PERSON TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT.
 IN MY OPINION, SPENCER HAS
SOME PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENTS.
I WOULD NOT WANT TO SIT NEXT TO
TONEY.
I THINK HE'S TOO CHARMING, AND
EVERYBODY LIKES HIM.
MORGAN IS ANNOYING AND SHE'S A
BITCH, BUT SHE'S GOING TO STAY
THAT WAY, SO SHE'S NOT REALLY A
THREAT.
SHE'S JUST EXTRA LUGGAGE WE'RE
CARRYING AROUND HERE.
A MILLION DOLLARS IS A BIG
CARROT.
AT THIS POINT PEOPLE KNOW I AM
WILLING TO PLAY THIS GAME.
THEY'VE BROUGHT ME THEIR GAME
PLAN.
AND I CAN IT'S GORE WITH IT OR
CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES.
AND THAT'S HOW I AM IN THE
COURTROOM, TOO.
I DO TRIAL BY AMBUSH.
IT'S NOT A RECOMMENDED STRATEGY
BUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT A RECOMMENDED
STRATEGY BY ANY "SURVIVOR"
AUTHORITY, BUT I LOVE THE AMBUSH
AND I LOVE THE BLIND SIDE.
 Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
SARAH VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO TONY, BASED ON THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, THERE WAS
MASSIVE POWER SHIFT.
 THAT'S CORRECT, JEFF.
THEY HAD AN ALLIANCE OF SIX.
WE HAD AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE.
THE WIND CHANGED DIRECTIONS.
 Jeff: JEFF, OBVIOUSLY I WAS
THE WIND THAT BLEW THROUGH.

 Jeff: WHAT WAS THE FALLOUT?
 I GOT CHEWED OUT.
I GOT THE COLD SHOULDER FROM
EVERYONE THAT FELT BETRAYED.
 Jeff: SPENCER, HOW DID IT
GO DOWN WITH YOU AND KASS.
 I RESPECT BIG MOVES, BUT I
DID FEEL BETRAYED AND THAT GOT
ME A LITTLE BIT RILED UP, AND I
GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND, I DID.
 Jeff: SO YOU HAVE TO BE
FEELING VERY GOOD THAT YOU HAVE
THAT NECKLACE TONIGHT.
 YEAH, I MEAN, IT FEELS VERY
GOOD, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I
PLAY THE GAME TO WIN THE GAME.
I WOULD RATHER RISK GOING OUT
NOW FAR SHOT AT WINNING THAN
EXTEND MY STAY IN THE GAME.
SO IT FEELS GOOD, BUT IT COULD
FEEL A LOT BETTER.
 Jeff: SO TONE YEAR, WHEN
YOU HEAR THAT KIND OF AN ANSWER,
DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOUR
DECISION ABOUT WHO YOU WOULD
VOTE OUT TONIGHT?
 WELL, WE LEAGUER AT PHYSICAL
STRENGTH, WE'RE LOOKING
STRATEGIC, SOCIAL, WHO WILL TRY
TO CRACK OUR ALLIANCE, SO WE
MADE A CONSENSUS AS A GROUP SO
WE CAN IS HAVE NICE, SMOOTH SAIG
AHEAD.
 Jeff: MORGAN, WHAT DO YOU
SAY?
YOU'VE GOT JEREMIAH BEHIND ME.
 I'M NOT A PHYSICAL THREAT.
I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT THEM IN
THESE HARD CHALLENGES AND PEOPLE
DON'T REALLY SEEM TO LIKE ME, SO
VOTES AREN'T GOING TO GO TO ME.
 TRISH, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN
AND NO ONE LIKES ME, SO WHY GET
RID OF ME?
 I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
PRETTY ACCURATE.
SHE LEFT OUT THAT SHE DOESN'T
HELP OUT IN CAMP AND IF YOU WANT
TO ADD TO THAT LIST, WHY YOU
MIGHT WANT TO TAKE HER ALONG, I
COULD CONTINUE TO ADD TO THAT.
 Jeff: MORGAN, WHAT DOES IT
FEEL LIKE THE HEAR THAT?
 L.J. AND JEREMIAH TOOK REAL
GOOD CARE OF US GIRLS IN THE
BEGINNING, WAKING UP WITH A COLD
POT OF RICE, AND I GOT USED TO
IT.
 Jeff: LET'S TALK CANDIDLY.
 UH-HUH.
 Jeff: I'M GOING TO GUESS
THAT YOU'RE SORT OF USED TO THAT
BACK HOME, AS WELL.
 ABSOLUTELY.
I'M USED TO THINGS BEING EASIER
FOR ME AND NOT HAVING TO WORK
THAT HARD TO GET THINGS, BUT...
 Jeff: BASED ON, WHAT LOOKS?
 YEAH.
IF ANY PERSON IN THE WORLD COULD
DECIDE TO BE UGLY OR CUTE MOST,
WOULD PICK CUTE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT WHY...
 Jeff: THAT'S ONE OF THE
GREATEST QUOTES EVER HEARD ON
"SURVIVOR."
 IF I DON'T WORK AS HARD AS
OTHERS, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, AND
I WILL TRY TO... I WILL WORK
HARDER.
I WON'T TRY.
LY WORK HARDER IN CAMP.
 Jeff: JEFRA, THE NICE THING
ABOUT HAVING KASS JOIN YOUR FIVE
IS IT WOULD SEEM SHE INSTANTLY
BECOMES NUMBER SIX, SO YOU DON'T
LOSE ANY PLACE IN THE GAME AND
YOU DWAYNE THE POWER AGAIN.
 YEAH, JEFF, THAT'S NOT REALLY
HOW WE LOOK AT OUR ALLIANCE.
WE LOOK AT OUR ALLIANCE AS A
TRAIN.
EVERYBODY IS A DIFFERENT LINK ON
THE CHAIN.
I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL EVEN
AND...
 Jeff: BUT JEFF, YEAH
TYPICALLY HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
YOU SEEN AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH
THERE IS NO ONE ON THE BOTTOM,
WE ARE ALL ONE?
 WE HEARD LATEST TRIBAL WHEN
THE BRAINS ARE SAYING, WE'RE ALL
ONE, WE'RE ALL ONE.
TONY SAID WE'RE FULL OF IT.
 WE'RE SAYING IT FOR A
DIFFERENT REASON.
THIS ALLIANCE WAS PUT TOGETHER
BY DEFAULT.
THAT'S AN ALLIANCE OF NUMBERS.
 HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT?
 BECAUSE WE PICKED EACH OTHER.
 I'M JUST SAYING, SOMEONE'S
ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM.
 I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE
WON'T BE IN THE FUTURE, BUT AS
OF NOW, I THINK THAT WE GOT A
STRONG ALLIANCE.
 ON TOP OF IT, JEFF, SCASES IN
A COMFORTABLE PLACE, SO SHE'S
STICKING TO IT.
 Jeff: TONY, IF I MAY, SHE'S
UNPREDICTABLE.
YOU DON'T KNOW SHE'S NOT SETTING
YOU GUYS UP TONIGHT.
 THAT'S THE TRUTH, JEFF.
 Jeff: TRISH, DOES THAT
CONCERN YOU A LITTLE BIT,
LETTING SOMEONE LIKE KASS INTO
YOUR ALLIANCE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
THERE'S A RISK THAT SHE COULD GO
BACK, FLIP BACK TO THE OTHER
PEOPLE, BUT WE JUST KEEP
CONTINUING TO INCLUDE HER IN THE
GROUP AND TREAT HER LIKE WE
TREAT EVERYONE THAT'S IN OUR
ALLIANCE.
 Jeff: KASS, THIS IS YOUR
DILEMMA RIGHT HERE, THAT WHEN
THIS GROUP SAYS YOU'RE AS MUCH
PART OF THIS ALLIANCE AS THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN IT FOR
MANY, MANY MORE DAYS THAN YOU,
IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU SAYING,
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE
DISINGENUOUS.
 WE'RE ALL ON THE EQUAL CHAIN,
REMEMBER?
YOU KNOW WHAT, I UNDERSTAND THE
GAME.
I MADE A DECISION, THERE WAS NO
ALLIANCE FORMED.
THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE.
WHEN I GO TO VEGAS AND I SIT
DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH A FRIEND,
I DON'T MIND BEATING THEM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TRISH, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
ALL RIGHT.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCILLARY
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, TONY.
TONEY.
TONY.
THAT'S THREE VOTES TONY.
TONEY.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES TONY.
MORGAN.
MORGAN.
FOUR VOTES TONY, TWO VOTES
MORGAN.
MORGAN.
THAT'S THREE VOTES MORGAN.
MORGAN.
WE'RE TIED.
FOUR VOTES TONE YEAR, FOUR VOTES
MORGAN.
MORGAN.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES MORGAN, FOUR
VOTES TONE YEAR, ONE VOTE LEFT.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
MORGAN.
MORGAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 Jeff: WELL, CLEARLY YOU
DIDN'T VOTE OUT THE BIGGEST
THREAT, WHICH ILLUSTRATES ONCE
AGAIN YOU CAN NEVER FULLY TRUST
ANYTHING ANYBODY SAYS.
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE OUT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WITH ONLY NINE LEFT,
PARANOIA IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.
 WE'RE GOING TO TURN ON EACH
OTHER.
 IT'S TURNING ALLIES INTO
ENEMIES.
 I HAVE TO MAKE A BIG MOVE
BEFORE HE DOES.
 TONY WANTS TO GET RID OF WOO
NOW.
 OH, MY GOD, TONY IS TOTALLY
FREAKING OUT.
 I GOT STRIKE NOW.
 I WANT TO SAY HOW PROUD I AM
OF MYSELF.
IT WAS GREAT EXPERIENCE.
THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT
AT TRIBAL, THEY WAS SPITEFUL OR
THEY WAS LAZY, BUT I COULD CARE
LESS WHAT THEY SAID.
I MEAN, KASS IS A CHILD AND IF
SHE WAS UPSET WITH ME, WHATEVER.
GROW UP.
YOU'RE 40.
GET OVER IT.
