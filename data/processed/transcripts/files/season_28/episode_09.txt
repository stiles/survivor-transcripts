 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": EVERYONE WAS
BATTLING FOR HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS, AND IT WAS SPENCER WHO
FOUND ONE.
 IT WAS A PLAIN OLD IDOL BUT I
BOUGHT MYSELF A LOT OF TIME,
POTENTIALLY.
 Jeff: BUT THE IDOL WITH
DIFFERENT POWERS WAS YET TO BE
DISCOVERED.








 IT'S A SECURITY BLANKET THAT
I WOULD LOVE TO COVER MYSELF
WITH.
I NEED TO FIND THAT EYEOL.
 Jeff: THERE WAS ALSO A
BATTLE BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES.
 WE HAVE A MAJORITY OF SIX,
TASHA, SPENCER, AND JEREMIAH ARE
EASY PICKINGS.
 Jeff: BUT AT THE LAST
REWARD, TONY SAW A CHANCE TO USE
THE IMMUNITY AWARD TO HIS
ADVANTAGE.
 WHEN IT'S TIME TO TAKE L.J.,








OUT, I'LL GO BACK TO MY
ALLIANCE.
 RIGHT NOW WE'LL LET THEM KILL
EACH OTHER AND WE'RE GOOD.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, HE
GOT WHAT HE WANTED.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY, L.J.
BLINDSIDING L.J. AND HIS
ALLIANCE.
L.J., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
EIGHT ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 I LOVE THIS GAME.
 SO WHO ALL FLIPPED?
JUST WOO.
 AND TONY?
 YEAH.
 TONY AND WOO.
 WHAT WAS YOUR REASONING?
 I HAVE A FEW REASONS.
 OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
 I COULDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT
L.J., AND I COULDN'T TELL TRICIA
ABOUT L.J., AND I COULDN'T TELL
KASS BECAUSE YOU GUYS LIKE L.J.,
AND YOU GUYS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.
 TONY COMPLETELY BAMBOOZLED
L.J.
AS FIRST I FELT LIKE, WOW, I
WISH I KIND OF KNEW BUT
IMMEDIATELY I KNEW WHY HE DIDN'T
TELL ME.
HE WAS AFRAID THE PLAN WOULD GET
DESTROYED SO I WASN'T MAD.
I STILL TRUST TONY AND TONY
STILL TRUSTS ME.
 IS THIS A ONE-VOTE ALLIANCE?
 YES.
 YOU ARE TELLING ME I'M ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE.
 YOU ASKED ME--
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T.
 I LIKE TO PLAN AROUND WHAT I
THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO.
TONY IS NOT SO PREDICTABLE.
TONY LIKES BIG MOVES, AND I'M
NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
BECAUSE IT BENEFITTED ME, BUT HE
COULD DO THE EXACT SAME THING
LATER, AND I CAN'T ALWAYS COUNT
ON HIM.
 WE TELL WOO WE WERE GETTING
CLIFF OUT?
NO.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE
THINGS BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING
TO CREATE CHAOS.
 THE SOONER WE MAKE A MOVE
FANCY TONY, THE FOR THE.
I'M VERY TIGHT WITH JEREMIAH AND
TASHA.
NOW IT'S A MATTER OF FINDING OUT
WHICH STRAGGLERS WE TAKE ALONG
TO MAKE MOVES WITH.
 RIGHT NOW, MY RED FLAG'S
RAISED BECAUSE I BLINDSIDED L.J.
I'M IN TROUBLE SO I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO GET
MYSELF OUT OF IT.
MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF,
WE GO ALL THE WAY TO THE WATER
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A BIT FURTHER
AWAY FROM CAMP WHERE PEOPLE
CAN'T HEAR YOU AND THAT'S WHERE
THEY TALK STRATEGY.
SO I STARTED TO WORKING ON
BLUEPRINTS TO MAKE A NICE LITTLE
SHACK AROUND THE WATER WELL.
THE WATER WELL IS HERE.
THERE'S A TREE THERE.
AND I PUT SOME BUSHES AND SOME
SHRUBS AND SOME BROKEN BRANCHES
WHERE I CAN HIDE RIGHT IN THAT
AND I'M WITHIN FIVE SPHEET AWAY.
THAT'S WHERE I'LL BE THE THE
MOST PATIENT, WHEN I'M SITTING
IN MY SPY SHACK.
 I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE FOOLED BY TONY BECAUSE I
FEEL LIKE, HONESTLY, HE IS
PLAYING US, TRISH.
IS THERE EVEN AN ALLIANCE, DO
YOU THINK?
 I DO THINK THERE IS.
I THINK IF THE FIVE OF USE I
THINK THE ALLIANCE STILL STAYS
STRONG.
JUST WITHOUT L.J.
 OKAY.
 BECAUSE THEN WE JUST CONTINUE
TO TAKE OUT THOSE THREE, RIGHT?
 RIGHT.
 BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THAT
TONY WENT INTO THE WRONG
BUSINESS.
I THINK HE'S AN ACADEMY
AWARD-WINNING ACTOR.
 I KNOW, BUT WE GOTTA BE
CAREFUL WITH THAT.
 WHEN I WAS DOING MY
SURVEILLANCE DIHEAR JEFRA AND
TRISH TALKING, AND TRISH SAID
TONY IS GOING TO WIN AN ACADEMY
AWARD FOR HIS ACTING SKILLS.
 I'M OKAY WITH BLINDSIDING
L.J. AND GETTING HIM OUT, BUT
IT'S THE WAY HE WENT ABOUT IT
THAT MAKES ME NOT WANT TO TRUST
TONY.
YOU KNOW, HE LIED TO MY FACE.
HE WANTS TO SAY WE HAVE AN
ALLIANCE?
 RIGHT NOW IN THE GAME I TRUST
TRISH.
I TRUST WOO.
I TRUST KASS.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
I DON'T REALLY TRUST JEFRA
ANYMORE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
TRUFF ME.
AND IF SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME, I'M
NOT GOING TO TRUST HER.
SO NOW I'M IN TROUBLE.

 FINAL, FINAL.
 DO IT, DO IT.
 FINAL, FINAL.
 THEY GOT SOMETHING?
FINAL.
 PUT FIGHT RIGHT HERE.
 Jeff: THINK YOU HAVE AN
IDEA, GIVE IT A SHOT.
SPENCER AND TAWSHIA LOOK NEXT
DOOR.
 TRIBAL?

 FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.
 Jeff: TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS THIS PHRASE?
HOW DOES IT CONNECT TO THIS
REWARD?
 WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
 Jeff: WOO AND KASS GOING TO
CHANGE IT AROUND.
THEY'VE GOT A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT IDEA.
THEY'RE CHANGING EVERYTHING.
 GET THE "F."
PUT THE "F" ON THE END SPENCER
AND TASHA LOOK NEXT DOOR.
NOW THEY THINK THEY KNOW WHAT IT
IS.
COULD BE A RACE TO THE FINISH.
THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU RIGHT?
 YEAH, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
IT'S NOT IT.
IT'S NOT IT.
 YES, IT IS.
MAYBE IT IS.
 HOW?
WHY HAS THE "WHY" GONE?
 Jeff: TASHA, JEFRA,
JEREMIAH, AND SPENCER WIN
REWARD!
 I'M SO SOR VEE FOR
HEADBUTTING YOU.
 THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
HOW IS "Y" IN FIGHTING.
 Jeff: JEFRA SPENCER, TASHA,
GEMAY, HUGE VICTORY, GREAT
REWARD.
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD OUT AND
ENJOY IT.
KASS, WOO, TRISH, TONY, TO THE
NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
 WHEN WE LOST TODAY'S
CHALLENGE THE FIRST THING THAT
COMES TO MY MIND IS WE'RE IN
TROUBLE.
TONY'S IN TROUBLE TOO BUT WE'RE
ALL IN TROUBLE, TOO.
THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE-- SPENCER,
TAWSH, JEREMIAHA, JEFRA-- JEFRA
THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ME
ANYMORE, THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S IN AN ALLIANCE ANYMORE.
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.
 I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BITTER
ABOUT A LOSS, BUT I SHOULD HAVE
GIVEN THEM CREDIT, MAN.
 THE WORST PART IS TAWSH,
JEREMIAH, AND SPENCER--
 THEY'RE GOING TO PULL IN--
THEY'RE GOING TO TALK TO JEFRA.
 I'M JUST TIRED OF IT, TIRED
OF LOSING.
BUT IF I WANT A MILLION DOLLARS,
I NEED TO STICK WITH THIS FIVE--
WOO, TONY, TRISH, AND JEFRA.
 I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME
WATER.
 DO YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT.
 NO.
 FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, TONY
FELT THREATENED AND GOT RID OF
L.J.
I'M NOT OFFENDED BY SOMEONE
MAKING A MOVE.
TONE SEANNOYING BUT NIGH
MYPHILOSOPHY IS GET RID OF THE
ANNOYING PEOPLE.
 WE DIDN'T PROMISE WITH YOU,
BUT WE PROMISED US AND WE
INCLUDE YOU IN THE PROMISE
BECAUSE WE DEPARTMENT BRANG
BREAKOUR PROMISE TO L.J. WE HAVE
TO, TRISH.
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THIS
GAME-- THE REWARD IS.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JEFRA
BEING OVER THERE?
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT I FEEL
PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE LEMON
TREES AND PAPAYAS I THINK I JUST
FOUND.
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO COME WITH
ME, I'LL STRATEGIZE ALL DAY
LONG.
 I'M TRYING TO TELL TRISH I'M
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING,
ENLIGHTEN THEM ON WHAT'S GOING
ON, HOW CRUCIAL THIS WAS TODAY.
THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF
THE OUR DEMISE.
SHE'S SAYING WHER WHERE ARE THE
LIMES AND PAPAYAS.
 WILL YOU COME WITH ME WOO?
YOU CAN CLIMB A LITTLE BIT AND I
NEED SOMEONE TO CLIMB.
 SO TONY WILL STRATEGIZE BY
HIMSELF.
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THE IDOL.
EXPLIEMS PAPIE AS.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
AS FAR AS THE IDOL HIDING IN THE
RIVERBANK, IT'S VERY POSSIBLE
THAT SPENCER, TAWSH, OR JEREMIAH
HAD IT.
BUT WHEN WE HAD A MERGE IT SAID,
"HIDDEN NEAR CAMP IS AN IDOL
WITH SPECIAL POWERS."
THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT.
LET ME FIND THAT IDOL.
I'LL BE SUPER TONY.
TONY IN TROUBLE NO MORE.
WHERE IS THIS THING, MAN?
 CAN YOU SEE THAT?
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT THEM!
 THEY LOOK LIKE MORGAN'S
BOOBS.
ANOTHER DON'T GO UP ANY FURTHER
THAN THAT.
JUST SHAKE YEAH!
YEAH!
 HEADS UP!
 I'M JERKING THIS PAPAYA TREE,
SHAKING, SHAKING, SHAKING, BOOM!
AND I GET AT LEAST SEVEN MONSTER
PAPAYAS.
 NICE, WOO.
NICE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
 THAT BRANCH I HAD IN MY RIGHT
HAND WAS A DEAD BRANCH THEY
DIDN'T REALIZE, AND FROM THERE I
WAS TRYING TO PULL A SYLVESTER
STALLONE CLIFF HANGER, TWING
SWING MY LIFT HAND AND AS SOON
AS I SWING IT SNAP, AND I'M LIKE
OOOHBOOM!
OH, MY BUTT.
 DID YOU BREAK IT?
OH!
WOO, ARE YOU OKAY?
 YEAH, I'M COOL.
HOOO"H" THATO-- THAT'S A CHARLIE
HORSE.
 I HOPE YOU DIDN'T BREAK YOUR
TAILED BONE.
 IT'S LIKE, WOW, THESE GUYS
ARE ON AN EPIC REWARD, AND I'M
THINKING, OH, MAN, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT I DID NOT WANT TO
HAPPEN.
 THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK UP.
 OH, MY GOSH.
OH, MY BUTT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY LUCKY
TO COME OUT OF IT OKAY.
WE GOT SOME FRESH PAPAYA AND
SOME LIEMS, SO, YOU KNOW, I'M
PUMPED.
 THIS IS GORGEOUS.
 THIS IS CRAZY!
 IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT YOU
GET TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE
THIS.
 I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A CAVE IN
MY LIFE.
 WATCH YOUR STEP.
IT'S SLIPPERY.
 I'M GOOD.
 WOW!
THIS IS SO COOL.
 THE REWARD WAS REALLY, REALLY
COOL.
THE CAVES HAD A SCALE ABOUT THEM
THAT WAS JUST EPIC.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE
IT.
 WOW!
THIS IS AWESOME!
 WOW!
 AND HERE'S YOUR LUNCH!
 OH, THANK YOU!
 OH, MY GOSH, LOOK AT THIS.
 I'LL LEAVE YOU FOR A WHILE.
I'LL BE BACK SOON.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 ALTHOUGH THE CAVE WAS
MAGNIFICENT, EVEN MORE
MAGNIFICENT WAS TABLE OF FOOD.
IT FELT LIKE YOUR HOMETOWN
BARBECUE.
 LET ME LOAD YOU ALL DOWN.
HOW MANY RIBS YOU WANT?
 TWO.
 YOU WANT TWO?
 OKAY, MAKE IT THREE.
 IT SOUNDS GOOD.
 HOW IS THE TEA.
 IT'S GOOD.
 I WAS ON THE REWARD WITH NO
DISTRACTIONS WITH MY CORE
ALLIANCE, JEREMIAH, AND TASHA,
AND JEFRA, WHO WE NEED TO PULL
IN.
IT WAS JUST PERFECT BECAUSE I
NEED JEFRA TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT US
AND OUR FOUR.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL, JEFRA?
 I MEAN, I'M JUST REALLY
CONFUSED, I GUESS, AT THIS
POINT.
BECAUSE THEY PULLED A BIG MOVE,
AND I WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT,
TRISH WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT, AND
KASS WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT.
I WAS JUST WHATEVER.
BUT IT REALLY MAKES ME QUESTION
WHERE I AM IN THE ALLIANCE IS
WHAT IT MAKES ME QUESTION.
 OR IF THERE IS ONE.
 EXACTLY.
 IT'S IN NO ONE'S BOSTON
INTEREST TO KEEP TONY DO WE
AGREE?
 AGREE.
 TONY FIRST, CLEARLY.
 JEFRA, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT WORKING WITH US?
 I NEED ANOTHER RIB TO THINK
ABOUT THIS.
 YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE RIBS YOU
WANT.
 ANYBODY ELSE WANT SOME.
 EXCUSE ME, I HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE FOR YOU, OKAY.
 OH!
 OH, MY GOSH!
 OH, MY GOSH!
 IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
 I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
JEFRA KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
OR BEFORE I COULD EVEN GET THE
LETTER FROM HOME IN MY HAND I
WAS SQUALLING AND SCREAMING AND
IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.
MY MOTHER'S WORDS HIT HOME FOR
ME SO HARD.
AND, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS YOU
DON'T WANT TO BREAK DOWN,
SUSPECTS YOU DON'T WANT TO CRY
OUT HERE, SOMETIMES IT'S YOUR
ONLY OPTION.
 WHEW.
 I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT MY MOM'S
HANDWRITING.
MY MOM SAYS, "DON'T LET YOUR
KIND HEART BE YOUR DOWNFALL.
DON'T BE SCARED TO LIE, ALTHOUGH
YOU'RE NOT THAT KIND OF A
PERSON.
S"
SO THIS IS,IX, MY SIGN THEY
SHOULD PROBABLY JUMP SHIP AT
THIS POINT.
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
THERE'S NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT I DIDN'T WIN THE REWARD
CHALLENGE BECAUSE I NEED TO DO
HEAR EXACTLY WHAT MY MOM WAS
TELLING ME.
FINAL FOUR?
 FINAL FOUR.
 FINAL FOUR.
 LET'S ALL SHAKE.
 FINAL FOUR, BABY BAB.
 YOU SHOOK MY HAND BEFORE,
BUDDY.
 YOU SHOOK MY HAND BEFORE.
I'M HOLDING YOU TO THIS THIS
TIME.

GOING TO STAND ON THE NARROW
BEAM WHILE BALANCING A BALL ON A
PLATFORM.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, YOUR FEET
WILL MOVE DOWN TO A MORE NARROW

DREAM OF FINISHING THIS GAME AND
WINNING THE MILLION DOLLARS WILL
COME TO AN END.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 THANKS, JEFF.
 I DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH TONY.
THE REST OF THE ALLIANCE BELIEVE
EVERYTHING THE MAN SAYS LIKE
HE'S JESUS OR SOMETHING.
I'M MORE TRUSTING OF JOSH,
JEREMIAH AND SPENCER AT THIS
POINT.
AND IT COULD BE MY OPPORTUNITY
TO GET RID OF TONY NOW THAN
GETTING RID OF TONY LATER.
THAT WAS GOOD MAN.
THAT THIRD LEVEL I WASN'T GOING
TO MAKE IT ALONG.
ME NEITHER.
AS OF NOW THE PLAN IS FOR
SPENCER, JERIMIAH, MYSELF
AND JEFFRA TO BLIND SIDE TONY.
THE PROBLEM IS IT CAN BE 4 AND4
AND WE MAY HAVE TO DO A REVOTE
AND GO TO ROCKS
BUT WE FEEL THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON TO VOTE OUT IS TONY
WOOD.
I'M NOT MAKING A FIRE.
I'M NOT BOILING WATER.
I'M ON A MISSION.
I NEED AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ICONIC,
SOME LANDMARK.
SO I FIGURED THERE'S A
CRAZY-LOOKING TREE BEHIND TREE
MAIL.
I CHECKED THAT WHEN I FIRST CAME
HERE.
I'M GOING TO CHECK THAT AGAIN.
I'M LOOKING FOR THAT SPECIAL
IDOL.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO FIND IT.
 PLEASE, MAN.
PLEASE BE HERE.
 YOU'RE REALLY UPSET.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR FACE.
 I MEAN, I KNOW THAT YOU AND
TONY ARE REALLY CLOSE, BUT I
JUST DON'T FEEL SAFE IN OUR
ALLIANCE.
 WE GET BACK TO CAMP, AND I
NOTICED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH
JEFRA.
SHE-- SHE WEARS HER HEART ON HER
SLEEVE, AND SHE WAS LIKE--
ALMOST LOOKING LIKE SHE WAS ON
THE VERGE OF TEARS.
SHE'S FEELING THAT SHE'S AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE AND SHE
FEELS SHE CAN'T TRUST TONY.
 HE WANTS TO PREVENT HE'S
PLAYING BOTH SIDES BUT I'M OVER
HIS FAKENESS.
I'M OVER HIS LIES ABOUT L.J.
LIKE, IT'S JUST-- HE'S GETTING
ON MY FREAKING NERVES.
 SO, I WENT TO THE CRAZY
LOOKING TREE BY TREE MAIL.
NOTHING IS THERE.
I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME
JUST WALK THE PATH IN CASE
SOMETHING POPS OUT.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP.
I RUP INTO A TREE.
IT LOOKED LIKE A ROCKET SHIP.
IT HAD THESE BIG ROOTS.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
IT.
I SAID I HAVE TO START LOOKING
HERE.
SO I START DIGGING.
I START SCRATCHING.
... AND THEN I FELT SOMETHING.
SO I TOOK A PIECE OF STICK AND I
START DIGGING, I START DIGGING,
I START DIGGING.
I SAID OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, LET
THIS BE IT!
OH, MY GOSH!
I ALMOST PASSED OUT.
I WAS JUST SO HAPPY.
AND THEN WHEN I OPENED IT, IT'S
A SPECIAL IDOL.
OH!
OH, MY GOD!
WOW!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MAN.
THIS SPECIAL IDOL THAT I FOUND
TODAY IS PRYLESS.
THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL UPON
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM BEING VOTED
OUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
UNLIKE OTHER HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS THIS IDOL CAN BE PLAYED
AFTER THE VOTES ARE READ.
AFTER YOU SEE THE VOTES YOU
CANNIZE IT?
EVERYBODY'S EYES SAY BING.
THIS ONLY PROTECTS THE PERSON
WHO FIND IT.
YOU MAY NOT GIVE THIS IMMUNITY
IDOL TO ANOTHER TRIBE MEMBER.
I GOTTA GO WASH UP.
I GOTTA GO WASH UP.
I GOTTA GO WASH UP.
YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL THAT IS?
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
POWERFUL THAT IS.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHENEVER YOU GET RID OF SOMEONE
IN THIS GAME THAT IS ANNOYING
YOU, YOU SCREW YOURSELF.
 YEAH.
BUT LIKE I JUST CAN'T EVEN STAND
HIM.
 THAT'S HOW EVERYONE FEELS
THOUGH.
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM.
 SO THIS IS THE DEAL.
WE CAN'T GET RID OF HIM TONIGHT.
IF WE GET RID AM HUFF TONIGHT WE
GIVE THOSE THREE MORE POWER AND
WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING TO BEAT THEM IN THE
END.
ZIMUCH BETTER SHOT OF BEATING
TONY.
TONY, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO
TRUST YOU.
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRUST YOU,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE--
 DON'T INSULT ME, TRISH.
 I KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING--
 DON'T INSULT ME, FIRST LADY.
 EVERYBODY IS PARANOID YOU'RE
PLAYING DOUBLE AGENT.
 WHO IS, WHO IS, WHO IS?
 EVERYBODY IS.
 THE WHOWBL DOUBLE AGENT
THING.
 IT MAKES EVERYBODY PARANOID.
 I UNDERSTAND THAT, TRISH, BUT
IF YOU GUYS KNOW WHO I AM AND
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT, IF
YOU GUYS KNOW I GAVE YOU GUYS MY
WORD-- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE.
ALL THREE OF THEM ARE GONE.
THAT I'M GUARANTEEING YOU.
 I WAS QUESTIONING TONIGHT'S
INTEGRITY, AND HE ADMITTED THE
DOUBLE AGENT ISN'T GOING TO WORK
AND JEFRA NEEDED TO HEAR THAT I
WAS CALLING HIM OUT, AND THAT'S
WHY I DID WHAT I DID.
BUT I THINK SHE'S PRETTY LOYAL.
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL FLIP.
 I THINK SPENCER HAS THE IDOL.
 I'M TELLING YOU.
I KNOW HOW TO READ PEOPLE.
WOO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 IF SPENCER HAS AN IDOL, THEN
WE'RE SCREWED.
YOU KNOW, TASHA'S SAFE TONIGHT
SO FOR TO US GET RID OF SPENCER
WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER,
CONSIDERING HE'S GOOD WITH THE
JURY, PLUS HE IS VERY CAPABLE OF
WINNING IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.
JEREMIAH, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS
ONE OF THOSE ATHLETES THAT
THREATS OUR CHANCES AS WELL.
BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE
DON'T HAVE 100% CERTAINTY ON,
AND THAT'S WHO HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
 JEREMIAH, I CAN TALK TO YOU
JUST FOR ONE SECOND?
I KNOW THAT I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO YOU THE OTHER DAY, BUT I'M
NOT GOING TO BE VOTING WITH YOU.
 OKAY, THAT'S FINE.
 I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.
IT'S JUST FOR MY BEST INTEREST
IN THE GAME.
 THAT'S OKAY.
 IT'S NOTHING AGAINST YOU
PERFECTLY.
 I SEE JEFRA WITH HER OLD
ALLIANCE, EVERYBODY BUT ME,
SPENCER, AND TASH, AND I JUST
KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.
 THAT'S FINE.
 SORRY.
 I DIDN'T PUT A LITTLE BIT OF
TRUST IN HER.
SHE SHOOK MY HAND.
SHE PROMISED US AND ALL THAT AND
I I GUESS I GOT THE BETTER OF
HER.
 NO WONDER YOU'RE SO FREAKING
HOT!
 SO JEREMIAH REALIZES THERE'S
A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT ONE OF
US IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
SO HE DECIDED TO LET THE CAT OUT
OF THE BAG AND SAY THAT HE'S A
FASHION MODEL.
 HE'S A HOT MODEL.
 IT DOESN'T SURPRISE THEE MEE
THAT JEREMIAH THINKS HIM BEING A
FASHION MOD CELL THIS BIG-DEAL,
TOP-SECRET THING THAT HE CAN'T
TELL PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
FROM THE BEAUTY TRIBE.
SO I DECIDED TO RETURN THE
FAVOR.
 I GOT ONE THING I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, TOO.
 YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT.
SO --
 YOU GOT THE IDOL.
 SHHH!
YEAH.
 DO YOU REALLY?
 I FOUND IT ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
 YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
 I TOLD TASHA AND JEREMIAH
ABOUT MY IDOL, BECAUSE NOW IS
THE TIME TO GO FOR IT, ROLL THE
DICE, TAKE A CHANCE.
IF IT WORKS OUT, IT'S ANOTHER
SHOT.
YOU KNOW, THE GAME IS NOT OVER.
 SO WHO DO WE VOTE TONIGHT?
 WOO.
 WHY WOO INSTEAD OF TONY?
 I THINK JUST BECAUSE HE'S THE
BIGGEST PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.
 OKAY.
 I CAN PLAY THIS THING FOR ME.
I CAN PLAY IT FOR JEREMIAH.
I COULD KEEP IT.
BUT IF I USE IT WRONG, I COULD
BE KICKING MYSELF FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
SARAH.
MORGAN.
AND L.J., VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO, SPENCER, LAST TRIBAL, IT
LOOKED LIKE YOU, TASHA, AND
JEREMIAH WERE IN TROUBLE, AND
THEN L.J.'S BLINDSIDED.
SO THE QUESTION IS, IS THE GAME
UP FOR GRABS NOW?
 THE GAME WAS UP FOR GRABS FOR
A WHILE.
BUT THE THREE OF US KNOW WHERE
WE STAND, WHICH IS ON THE
OUTSIDE.
 Jeff: JEREMIAH, YOU CONCUR
WITH THAT?
 YEAH, I WENT TO THE REWARD
YESTERDAY, GOT TO TALK TO JEFRA
A LITTLE BIT, TRIED TO FIGURE
OUT IF WE COULD, KNOW, UPSET
THIS GAME SOMEHOW BUT SHE DECIDE
TO GO BACK THE OTHER WAY.
 Jeff: JEFRA IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE VERY IMPRESSIONABLE.
 I WAS STILL BITTER ABOUT
EVERYTHING WITH L.J. AND
WONDERING WHERE I STOOD IN MY
OWN ALLIANCE.
 JEFF, THE THREE OF US DIDN'T
KNOW.
IT WASN'T JUST HERSELF THAT
DIDN'T KNOW.
IT WAS ALL OF US THAT DIDN'T
KNOW.
 TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
JEFF, I STARTED WEIGHING OUT MY
OPTIONS AND I FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE RISKING BEING
BLINDSIDED BY THIS ALLIANCE
VERSUS HAVING TO SIT IN THE
FINAL WITH TASH OR SPENCER WHO
WOULD PROBABLY MEET BEET ME AT
THIS GAME.
 Jeff: SPENCER, YOU'RE
DISGUSTING.
 IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING.
IF I WERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF A
VOTE I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO THE
CAMP WONDERING WHERE I STOOD.
I WOULD GO BACK KNOWING I WAS ON
THE OUTSIDE AND ON THE BOTTOM.
I MEAN, TONY SWORE ON HIS WIFE
AND HIS TID KIDTO EVERYONE HE'S
BROKEN MANY OF THOSE PROMISES.
HE WILL BREAK MORE OF THOSE
PROMISES.
SO JEFRA'S RIGHT-- THIS IS THE
POINT IN THE GAME WHERE YOU HAVE
TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND
WHO YOU'RE PLAYING WITH.
 YOU CAN BE SPECIFIC WHEN I
BROKE THAT PROMISE?
 YOU'VE BROKEN PROMISES TO
MANY PEOPLE.
 BE SPECIFIC--
 L.J.
AND I'M NOT ADMONISHING YOU FOR
BREAKING PROMISES.
I'VE DONE THAT, TOO.
I'VE LIED, TOO.
I'M JUST SAYING.
 I DIDN'T BREAK PROMISES.
I DID IT FOR A REASON.
 I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY-- IF
TONY AND ANY COMBINATION OF YOU
GUYS IS IN THE END MY VOTE GOES
TO TONY.
 MINE, TOO.
 BECAUSE TONY HAS BEEN
STEERING THIS GAME AND YOU ALL
HAVEN'T.
 Jeff: WOO, GOOD NEWS OR BAD
NEWS TO HEAR THAT THREE PEOPLE
WHO COULD END UP ON THE JURY ARE
SAYING IF TONY'S THERE, HE'S GOT
THREE.
 YEAH, THESE GUYS ARE ROOTING
FOR TONY, AND IF HE GOES TO THE
END, YEAH, THEY MIGHT VOTE FOR
HIM, BUT THE ONLY WAY HE'S GOING
TO GET THERE IS WITH THE HELP OF
US.
 I'M NOT ROOTING FOR TONY.
I'M ROOTING FOR ME UPON I'M JUST
SAYING I THINK WHAT TONE SEDOING
IS PUTTING HIMSELF IN A POSITION
TO WIN.
 WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION
TODAY YOU GUYS AREN'T AWARE EXPF
WE CALLED TONY OUT ON ALL OF HIS
GAMES AND PLAYING BOTH SIDES AND
SAID WE'RE COMPLETELY
UNCOMFORTABLE ITW IT.
 IT DOESN'T APPEAR ANYONE
SEEMS ALARPD.
 WE ARALARMED.
I CALLED HIM RIGHT OUT.
AND HE SAID HE'S GOING TO STOP
HIS CRAP AND I HOPE HE HEARD US.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 LOUDLY AND CLEARLY.
 ABSOLUTE.
JEFF IN THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO
MAKE POWER MOVES BUT TIMING IS
EVERYTHING.
RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE A RECKLESS
MOVE.
IN THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, WE
HAVE TO KEEP SOLID TO MOVE
FORWARD.
RIGHT NOW FOR THEM TO SAY COME
BACK WITH US, THAT'S A RECKLESS
MOVE TO DO THAT.
 Jeff: OKAY, SO IF IT IS
FIVE VERSUS THREE AND YOU CAN'T
VOTE FOR TASHA, WOO, HOW DO YOU
DECIDE WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE
FOR BETWEEN SPENCER AND
JEREMIAH.
 WE WEIGHED OUT THE OPTIONS
WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THREAT AT
THIS POINT.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE
BECAUSE WE COULD POSSIBLY GIVE
IT TO ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO IS
GOING TO PLAY THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL TONIGHT.
 Jeff: SO JEREMIAH, THERE
HAS BEEN A LOT OF CAPPEDID
CONVERSATION, AND YOU FEEL
PRETTY CINSED IT IS YOU OR
SPENCENER TROUBLE TONIGHT.
WHAT TO YOU DO TRY TO GET ITA
OFF AND YOU ON TO SPENCER.
 SPENCER IS A BIG THREAT.
I LOVE THE GUY TO DEATH BUT HE'S
PROBABLY A BIGGER THREAT IN THE
GAME THAN I AM.
 Jeff: SPENCER, HOW DO YOU
FEEL?
HE'S DOING WHAT HE HAS TO DO.
 I DEFINITELY DON'T BLAME HIM
FOR MAKING THOSE POINTS.
MAYBE I'M PERCEIVED AS BEING A
BIG THREAT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
SPOACIAL GAME.
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST LIKABLE
PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET.
 Jeff: TASHA, HOW DO YOU
GUYS DECIDE WHO YOU'RE GOING TO
AIM FOR.
HONESTLY, WE VOTED FOR TONY LAST
TIME, KNOWING WE COULDN'T
OUTVOTE THEM, AND HE WAS UPSET--
 I WAS NOSUTACCEPT.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO TONY
TONIGHT.
 YOU CAN'T DO TONY TONIGHT
BECAUSE I HAVE MY BAG OF TWRIKS
ME AS USUAL.
 SO WE PICKED SOMEONE.
 I DON'T SEE YOU PLAYING
ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR BAG OF
TRICKS.
 Jeff: SPENCER, TONY BROUGHT
UP THE BAG OF TRICKS BEGAN AND
YOU LAUGHED.
 NEVER LEAVE CAMP WITHOUT IT,
JEFF.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN HIS
BAG OF TRICKS.
I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT BUT I
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE CHANCE TO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
KASS, YOU'RE UP.
 BRO!
THIS VOTE IS A REAL BUMMER,
DUDE!
MAN!
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 YOU CAN STEAL AS MANY CLUES
AS YOU WANT, WOO.
I'VE GOT THE REAL THING.
 Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR SPERNS WILL
NOT COUNT.
 JEFF, DO YOU THE SEE THE
INEXPERIENCE IN THE YOUNG LAD.
HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HIS IDOL TO
JEREMY.
HE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO USE
MINE.
THIS IS A FAKE IDOL, BY THE WAY.
 Jeff: OKAY, I'LL READ THE
VOTES.
FIRST VOTE.
WOO.
WOO.
THAT'S THREE VOTES WOO.
JEREMIAH.
JEREMIAH.
 SORRY, BUDDY.
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JEREMIAH.
WE'RE TIED THREE VOTES JEREMIAH.
THREE VOTES WOO.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JEREMIAH,
THREE VOTES WOO.
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
JEREMIAH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
JEREMIAH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 YUP.
 GOOD LUCK.
 Jeff: ANOTHER TRIBAL
COUNCIL WITH ANOTHER BIG MOVE.
SOMETIMES THEY WORK.
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO WIN THIS
GAME, YOU HAVE TO KEEP MAKING
THEM.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff:NEXT TIME ON"SURVIVOR."
WELCOME TO THE "SURVIVOR"
AUCTION.
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE'S MIND IS ON
THE AUCTION.
SPENCER USES HIS BRAIN--
 HER SAYING SHE WANTEDS TO
VOTE YOU OUT WASN'T A LIE GLA TO
CHANGE THE GAME.
 IF I CAN MAKE TONY PARANOID,
IT'S GOLD.
 FOR SOME ODD REASON I GUESS
THEY PIN POINTED ME.
SPENCER DONE WHAT HE HAD TO DO.
HE SAVED HIMSELF.
I THOUGHT I COULD WIN $1
MILLION.
I FEEL LIKE I PLAYED A GREAT
GAME.
I FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE WENT
ALL THE WAY.
34 YEARS I'VE NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I'M GLAD I HAD THE CHANCE TO BE
ABLE TO COME ON AND COMPETE AND
DO THE BEST I CAN.
