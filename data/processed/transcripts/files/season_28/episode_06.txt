 --- 

         Jeff: PREEFING ON
SURVIVOR.
 I'M TELLING YOU.
 Jeff: TWO COP, TONY AND
SARAH MADE A PACT TO STAY
TOGETHER.
 HE KNOWS I'LL BE LOYAL TO
HIM, I KNOW HE WILL BE LOYAL
TO ME.
 Jeff: BUT A SURPRISE
SWITCH PULLED THEM APART.








 I'M THE ONLY ORIGINAL
APPEARI MEMBER ON A TRIBE
WITH THREE BRAINS AND THREE
BEAUTIES.
 WHILE SARAH NEW TRIP HAD
A DECISION, TONY'S WAS
FILLED WITH EVERYTHING SUR
VOIFER HAS TO OFFER.
TWO IDOLS.
 I'M KEEPING THIS UNTIL I
PLAY THIS THING.
 Jeff: A BLINDSIDE.
 CLIFF.
 Jeff: AND THEY EVEN SAW








ONE OF THEIR TRIBE MEMBERS
QUIT.
 LYNSEY IS PULLING HERSELF
FROM THE GAME.
 SHE WAS A BODY, TWO FOR
THE PRICE OF ONE.
 Jeff: BUT DESPITE
EVERYTHING, THEY WON THE
LAST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
 SOLANA WINS IMMUNITY.
HIGH FIVE, BABY!
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
THE NEW APARRI TRIBE WAS
FOCUSED ON A POSSIBLE MERGE.
 Jeff: YOU ARE LOOKING TO
GET TO THE END AND
ANTICIPATE A MERGE T NEEDS
TO BE A TIGHT GROUP.
 THE POSSIBILITY THEY WILL
MERGE JEREMIAH OR ALEXIS
COULD SLIP TO THE OTHER SIDE.
 Jeff: AND IN THE END
EVERYBODY THOUGHT ALEXIS WAS
MOST LIKELY TO FLIP.
 ALEXIS, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
11 ARE LEFT WHO WILL BE
VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 YEAH.
 I FEEL GREAT AFTER
TRIBAL.
TRIBAL BETTERED MY GAME.
 TOP SIX, TOP SIX.
 WE GOT IT.
 WE DO.
 WE'RE MOTLEY CREW.
 NOW EVERYONE IS BUYING
INTO THE SIX.
IF WE MERGE TOMORROW, THAT'S
THE BEST NEWS POSSIBLE FOR
THIS TRIBE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
WE CONTROL THE GAME.
WE HAVE SIX AND THEY HAVE
FIVE.
 IN CASE WE WAKE UP TO A
MERGE IN THE MORNING, I
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE OUR
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO
PICKED OUT.
WHO IS OUR FIRST PERSON.
 TRISH RIGHT NOW.
 I DON'T THINK ANYONE-- IS
OFF THE TABLE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, EVERYONE
REALLY GETS IT, RIGHT?
 OH, YEAH.
 WE ALL UNDERSTAND.
WE ARE FINAL SIX 100% IN OUR
HANDS.
 WE DO.
AS LONG AS NOBODY FLIPS.
 FINAL SIX.
 FINAL SIX.
 THIS GROUP IS ALLEGEDLY A
SOLID SIX IT IF WE CAN ALL
STAY STRONG AS A CORE WE CAN
RUN THE SHOW AN TAKE OUT THE
LESS OBVIOUS TARGETS LIKE
TRISH OR JEFRA.
 TOP SIX, HOW SWEET DOES
THAT SOUND.
 SOUNDS A HELL OF A LOT
BETTER THAN TOP FIVE.
 IT SOUNDS SO SIMPLE BUT
THE BEST LAID PLANS OFTEN
END UP SPRAWLED OUT ON A
MURDER SCENE FLOOR.
 I FEEL LIKE LAST NIGHT
WAS GOOD, EVERYBODY'S
TOGETHER.
 YEAH.
 AND THE KEY IS TO BE
TIGHT-LIPPED SO THEY HAVE NO
CLUE WHO WE ARE VOTING FOR.
 THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT
PERSONALLY I WOULD BE
CONCERNED ABOUT ARE YOU AND
JEREMIAH.
 IT MIGHT GET UGLY AROUND
HERE.
TRUST ME.
 IF THEY ACCUSE ME OF NOT
STAYING TRUE TO MY WORD HIT
A CORD WITH ME.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE
CALLED A LIAR AND PRETTY
MUCH I GOT CALLED A LIAR
WITHOUT BEING CALLED A LIAR.
 I'VE DONE NOTHING TO
MISLEAD YOU GUYS IN MY
TRUST.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
FLIPPING.
I THINK YOU WOULD BE
STUPID --
 I'M NOT, THAT'S WHY IT
OFFENDS.
ME.
 WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO DO
TO PROVE TO YOU TO BE PART
OF AN A-- A ALLIANCE THAT IS
WHERE YOU STOP HAVING FAITH
IN ME AND I FEEL IT.
WHEN YOU GUYS KNOW THAT I'M
TEETERING, THAT GOING TO
PUSH ME AWAY.
 PEOPLE THINK THE DEMISE
OF THIS TRIBAL WILL BE
SOMEONE SLIPPING.
THE DEMISE IS-- IT WILL BE
NOT TRUSTING PEOPLE IN THIS
TRIBE.
THAT IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO
BE.
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
END OF US.
 YEAH.
 I DID NOT COME ON THIS
GAME AS A LIAR.
 WHEN I'M SHAKING HANDS
WITH SOMEONE, THAT'S WHAT I
DO.
 WHEN I SHAKE A HAND WITH
SOMEONE, THAT IS WHAT I DOM.
I'M WITH YOU.
 BECAUSE COME HERE WITH
ME.
 I'M WITH YOU.
 ALL RIGHT, I'M GOOD.
WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO TALK
ABOUT IT AGAIN.
 IN MY BUSINESS WE GO WITH
THE HARD EVIDENCE.
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU VOTE
WITH US ONE VOTE DOESN'T
MEAN I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRUE.
 11 PEOPLE LEFT, EIGHT
PEOPLE-- YOU DID WHAT YOU
HAD TO DO IN MY OPINION.
THAT DOESN'T SPEAK OF
LOYALTY THAT SPEAKS OF
DESPERATION AND A WISE MOVE.
YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN ANYTHING
TO ME EXCEPT YOU'RE SAVING
YOURSELF.
SHOW ME BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
FROM A FORMER TRIBE MATE AND)G> GOOD MORNING, SOLANA.
 GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.
 GOOD MORNING.
 IT'S HOT.
NOT ONE CLOUD IN THE SKY.
 HOW DID YOU SLEEP, LJ.
 WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS
GAME I WASN'T HAVING FUN
WITH MY TRIBE MEMBER, NOW
I'M OUT HERE WITH THE NEW
SOLANA AND HAVING FUN WITH
EVERYBODY.
 I WILL LET YOU DO THE
HONORS.
I WILL HOPE IT.
 MAY 17TH AND I'M HAVING
THE TIME OF MY LIFE.
 FEEL HOW HEAVY THIS ONE
IS.
 BUT IT'S KIND OF BORING,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
BECAUSE THERE'S NO
SCRAMBLING GOING ON.
THERE IS NO TRICKERY GOING
ON.
THERE'S NO SPYING.
THAT'S FUN FOR ME, YOU KNOW.
 SEE WHAT THIS IS.
 PACK UP ALL OF YOUR
ESSENTIAL ITEMS YOU MAY NEED
FOR THE NEXT 22 DAYS AND
HEAD ON OVER TO THE APARRI
CAMP WHERE YOU WILL SPEND
YOUR REMAINING DAYS IN THIS
GAME.
 MERGE, BABY.
 CONGRATULATIONS, WE MADE
IT.
 WE MADE IT.
 WE'RE GOING TO BE KEEP
STRONG.
 DONE FORGET WHAT WE HAD
OVER HERE, WHAT WE HAD
GOING.
 I KNOW, IT WAS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.
 NOW THAT WE HAVE A MERGE,
IT'S AN A EXCITING THING AND
A NERVE-RACKING THING AT THE
SAME TIME BECAUSE IT'S SIX
AGAINST FIVE.
AND WE CAN BE IN TROUBLE.
 THANK GOD I STILL HAVE
THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN
MY POCKET.
 THE FEELING THAT I HAD
WITH THIS IDOL, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S AN EXTRA PERSON IN MY
ALLIANCE.
WE HAVE FIVE PLUS THE IDOL.
IF ANY OF MY TRIBES IN THE
SOLANA 5 NEED T I WILL HELP
THEM OUT.
SO I THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY
GOOD SHAPE.
 HERE WE GO.
 HEY.
 YOU MAY WANT TO TIDDEE UP
CAMP A BIT AND MAKE SOME
ROOM.
 YES!
 WHOOO!
 YOU'LL BE HAVING GUESTS
FROM THE SOLANA TRIBE
ARRIVING SHORTLY AND SOME OF
THEM MAY BE STAYING HERE FOR
THE NEXT 22 DAYS.
 WE MADE IT, YOU GUYS.
 WE ARE JOINING TRIBES.
I THINK IT'S A MERGE.
I HOPE IT'S A MERGE BUT
BOTTOM LINE IS THE OTHER
TRIBE IS COMING OVER.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE LIVING
ON THE SAME BEACH.
 THEY'RE COMING HERE.
 THEY MAY BE STAYING HERE
FOR THE NEXT 22 DAYS, IT'S
GOING TO BE THE NEXT THREE
DAYS FOR ONE, NEXT SIX DAYS
FOR ANOTHER.
 I KNOW, WE'VE GOT THE
NUMBERS, YOU GUYS, WE MADE
THE MERGE AND WE HAVE THE
NUMBERS.
 WHEN THOSE FIVE GET HERE,
IT'S US AGAINST THEM AND I'M
TO THE GOING TO LET ANYONE
FORGET THAT.
 GUY, THINK SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING, I THINK
SOMETHING'S BREWING.
 IS THAT A ROWBOAT.
 YUP, IT IS.
 THEY BETTER HAVE FOOD IN
THAT BOAT.
 YEAH.
 DID YOU COME WITH FOOD?
 WE'RE BRINGING BACK
EVERYTHING WE TOOK FROM YOU.
AND THEN SOME.
 COME ON OVER, GUYS, WE'LL
PASS EVERYTHING OVER.
 WHEN THE BOAT PULLED UP I
WAS NERVOUS TO SEE MY OLD
TRIBE MATES.
IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT
FRIEND THAT YOU FROM HIGH
SCHOOL THAT YOU HAVEN'T
TALKED TO IN YEARS.
 IT IS GOOD TO BE HOME.
 I MISS THAT VOICE.
 I KNOW.
 THEN THEY START HANDING
THEIR BELONGINGS OFF ALONG
WITH FOOD.
 THAT IS SO GOOD.
 I'M LIKE --
 YEAH!
 HAVE A NICE PICNIC.
 IT IS SO DIFFERENT.
> I -- ANTICIPATE SEEING
MY GIRL ALEXIS GONE, LIKE
THAT WAS A HUANG THING FOR
ME.
WE WERE LIKE THIS.
COY EASILY PERSUADE HER TO
BE ON OUR SIDE.
AND I'M THINKING OH, SNAP
WHAT DO WE DO NOW.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
 IT SAYS CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR TRIBES ARE MERGED!
WHOOO!
 ENJOY THE FEAST PROVIDED.
YOU HAVE EARNED IT.
HIDDEN IDOLS ARE STILL IN
PLAY AND ANOTHER IDOL WITH
DIFFERENT POWERS IS HIDDEN
SOMEWHERE NEAR YOUR CAMP
DIFFERENT POWERS.
 HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WITH
SPECIAL PO PERER-- POWERS T
IS AWESOME ENOUGH ON ITS OWN
BUT NOW SPECIAL POWERS.
 I DON'T WANT THAT ONE.
 SEE YOU LATER.
 ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE SPECIAL POWERS CAN
BE, SO I GUESS THAT PERSON
THAT FINDS THAT IDOL IS THE
ONLY ONE THAT WILL KNOW WHAT
THE SPECIAL POWERS ARE.
 OF COURSE I'M GOING TO
LOOK FOR T I WILL SPEND 2, 3,
4 DAYS LOOKING FOR.
 IT IS GRAHN TO BE BACK,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A
TRIBE MADE.
 SOLARI.
 SOLANA MIXED WITH APARRI.
THAT WOULD BE ONE.
 WE SHOULD TALK IT OVER
WITH SOME FOOD.
 THIS IS WINE INFUSED.
 OH MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS.
 IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS
FRICKIN MORNING.
PART OF THE EXCITEMENT OF
BEING AT THE MERGE WAS JUST
SHOCK THAT I MADE IT YOU
KNOW, I WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF
A TRIBE THAT WAS ONE OF THE
WORST TRIBES IN SURVIVOR
HISTORIMENT AND SOMEHOW I'M
HERE AT THE MERGE AND I HAVE
NEW LIFE.
I'M IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,
NOW I'M TIED TIGHT WITH
SARAH, I'M TIGHT WITH
JEREMIAH, I'M TIGHT WITH
THIS GROUP OF SIX THAT COULD
POTENTIALLY RUN THE GAME OF
SURVIVOR AFTER THE MERGE.
 SO YOU GUYS VOTED OUT
ALEXIS.
 WE DID.
 GIVE US THE SCOOP.
 VOTED HER OUT.
 WE MIGHT BE IN SOME
TROUBLE.
SIX AGAINST FIVE, IT'S
PRETTY TOUGH.
SO THE ONLY HOPE THAT I HAD
PERSONALLY WAS SARAH.
BECAUSE SARAH WAS AN OLD
APARRI AN SWORE ON HER BADGE
TO ME TELLING HER SHE WANTS
TO BE WITH ME.
BUT MY BIGGEST FEAR IS IF
SARAH DOESN'T FLIP, WE'RE
DONE.
I'M DONE.
I DON'T WANT TO BE DONE.
 WE HAVE THE LARGEST.
 YEAH.
 TAKE A DEEP INHALE.
 YOU ARE LETTING YOUR ABS
RELEASE, ARE YOU TRYING TO
HOLD IT AND KEEP THESE
SHOULDERS DROPPED.
 THAT'S T GOOD, THAT'S
REALLY GOOD, YOU'RE PRETTY
FLEXIBLE, HUH, DASH.
 I AM.
 YEAH, ARE YOU.
AND THEN ONE MORE.
ARE YOU GOING TO INHALE.
 WHO DO YOU THINK IS AHEAD
IN THE SNAKE RIGHT NOW?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW
THERE'S A GROUP OF FIVE
WHICH IS MY ALLIANCE AND A
GROUP OF SIX WHICH IS HALF
BRAIN AND HALF BEAUTY AND
THEN YOU HAVE SARAH THAT
MAKES A SIXTH PERSON.
 BEFORE WE HAD IT REAL
TIGHT.
WE HAVE TO MEND THINGS.
 I WILL.
I WILL TRY AND SWAY HER BACK
IN.
 WE NEED ONE PERSON TO
COME ON OUR SIDE AND FLIP
THE SCRIPT AND MAKE IT 6 MY
SIDE AND FIVE THEIR SIDE.
SO SARAH, I AM HOPING SAR IS
IS THE MISSING LINK TO THIS.
 WHERE DO YOU STAND RIGHT
NOW, WHERE DO YOU STAND.
 I'M LIKE HONESTLY
FLOATING.
THIS IS HOW IT WENT OVER
THERE.
 SO IT'S A NO-BRAINER.
 THE BRAINS ARE TIGHT.
 IF WE GET BACK-- LISTEN,
SARAH, TONY, WOO, AND TRISH.
 DO WE HAVE TRISH.
 TRISH IS 100%, SHE ISEE
WITH ME, THAT'S FOUR, THAT
IS A TIGHT BOND.
LJ AND JEFRA HARX THAT IS
SIX OF US.
 OKAY.
 FIVE OF THEM.
ONE BY ONE BY ONE, THEY'RE
GONE.
IT'S THATCISM.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, SARAH.
 PIE GOAL IS TO MAKE SARAH
BELIEVE THAT I WANT TO SIT
AT THE TOP TWO WITH HER JUST
LIKE WE MENTIONED, TWO COPS
SITTING IN FRONT OF THE
JURY.
SO I'M GOING TO PROMISE HER,
I'M GOING TO GUARANTEE HER,
TO REASSURE HER THAT I'M NOT
LYING TO HER, THAT I REALLY
WANT HER TO COME ON OUR SIDE
AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE
GAME AS OPPOSED WITH THE
OTHER TRIBE IT COULD BE A
NO-BRAINER F YOU GIVE ME
YOUR WORD, SWEAR ON YOUR
BADGE RIGHT NOW.
 SWEAR ON MY BADGE WHAT.
 THAT ARE YOU ON OUR SIDE
THAT WILL YOU VOTE FOR
SOMEBODY, EITHER SPENCER OR
LINDSAY-- I MEAN SPENCER OR
KASS.
 SPENCER OR KASS.
 I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN
DO THAT YET, TONY.
 SO YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN
ARE YOU READY AND WHEN YOU
SWEAR ON YOUR BADGE, THEN
I --
 I KNOW, I KNOW.
 I'M IN THE BEST SPOT THAT
YOU CAN BE AT IN THIS GAME.
BECAUSE FIVE AND FIVE, AND
GUESS WHAT, I'M IN THE
MIDDLE.
A SARAH SANDWICH, IT'S
PERFECT.
 THEN WHO DO YOU THINK WE
EVEN TARGET.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT I
THINK THE FIRST ONE WE
SHOULD TARGET IS THE BRAINS,
BREAK THE BRAINS UP.
WHOEVER YOU WANT TO GET RID
OF EXCEPT FOR ME.
 I'M GUARANTEE YOU WITH US,
YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD.
GUARANTEEING THIS IS YOUR
BIG MOVE, YOUR BIG CHANCE.
 I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE
THE DECISION MAKER.
SO IT TRULY IS A
PREDICTMENT.
WHICHEVER SIDE I GO, I'M
SITTING PRETTY BECAUSE I
WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THIS
GAME ALL RIGHT, GUYS, DOW
WANT IN ON --
 LJ DOES NOT HAVE AN IDOL.
SO IF HE DOESN'T WIN
IMMUNITY HE IS GOING HOME.
AS HE SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE OUR VOTE, CORRECT.
 I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE
NEEDS TO GO FIRST.
 SOMEBODY HAS THE IDOL
FROM BEAUTY.
 IT AIN'T ME.
 OKAY, SO YOU THINK LJ'S
GOT AN IDOL.
 OKAY.
 I DON'T HAVE NO HIDDEN
IMMUNITY EYE DO.
I THINK LJ'S GOT IT.
THAT IS WHAT IS WORRYING ME,
THAT IS WHAT IS MAKING ME
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS GAME.
 I THINK SOMEBODY LIKE
JEFRA NEEDS TO GO.
 IT IS EITHER LJ OR WILL.
 WE GOT TO GET A STRONG
GUY OUT.
WE GOT TO GET RID OF WILL OR
LJ FIRST.
 IT CAN'T BE LJ.
 HE IS A PRETTY BOY, HE
HAS GOT THE IDOL.
 WOO IF IT'S NOT WOO IT'S
GOING TO BE WILL.
 NO, NO, SHE IS NOT A
THREAT.
I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY I
HAD OTIC TO PICK A FIGHT
WITH ME.
I'M NOT SAYING LET ME BE THE
PRINCESS AND WALK AROUND AND
WALK ON EGG SHELLS AROUND
ME.
BUT THE LAST THING YOU WANT
TO DO IS PISS ME OFF.
 WE CAN PRETEND IT'S LJ
BUT IT CAN'T BE.
 LJ WOULD BE BAD.
 THAT'S FINE.
BUT I AM NOT GOING ALONG
WITH TRISH, I WILL TELL YOU
THAT MUCH.
THAT WOULD BE FATAL TO US.
 WHAT IF WOO WINS IMMUNITY.
 THEN TONY?
 YEAH.
 I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT,
YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO PICK A
FIGHT WITH ME?
I'LL FLIP OVER WITH THOSE
OTHER GUYS.
SO DON'T TEST ME.
BECAUSE I WILL PUT NEW YOUR
PLACE AND SEND YOU PACKING.
 TRISH AND JEFRA CAN STAY.
GOT TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE
GUYS.
 THE BIG PICTURE.
 OKAY, TRISH IS HOOKED TO
TONY.
TRISH IS NOT HOOKED TO LJ,
TRUST ME.
 DUDE, I SAID IT ONCE, I
SAID IT A MILLION TIMES.
I DON'T TRUST THE COP.
WHEN SOMEONE, IN AN ALLEGED
ALLIANCE OF SIX SAYS I'M
ONLY VOTING FOR THESE PEOPLE
AND I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT
VOTE FOR THIS PERSON, THAT
LETS ME KNOW THAT SHE IS NOT
IN THE SIX.
SHE'S IN THE ONE.
 ONE THING WE CAN'T DO, IF
WE ARE A TIGHT SIX, WE
CANNOT BULLY.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE
BULLIED AROUND.
 WE'RE TO THE BULLYING
THAT IS WHAT WE DISCUSSED ON
THE BEACH BEFORE.
 I NEVER AGREED TO TRISH
FIRST.
 LET ME TELL YOU, WE'LL
TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW, GET
EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND GO
WITH THE MAJORITY.
 TONY FLAT OUT GOES.
YOU CAN PICK WHO YOU WANT TO
GO HOME.
 WHEN YOU COME TO ME AND
YOU SAY WELL, IF I GO WITH
THEM, WHO ARE MY FORMER
TRIBE MATES, THEY'RE GOING
TO LET ME CHOOSE WHO GOES
OUT.
AND SHE COMES TO US AND SAYS
I'M TELLING YOU WHO I WANT
OUT.
 CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT
TOMORROW.
 I DON'T LIKE BEING
ACCUSED OF BEING A BULLY.
 NOB IS ACCUSING YOU.
 IN MY VIEW NOBODY IN THIS
GAME SHOULD HAVE THAT MUCH
POWER.
WHO MADE HER QUEEN.
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HER.
I JUST WANT TO PUNCH HER
SOMETIMES
 DO YOU SEE ANY FISH AT
ALL?
WHAT IS THAT A CUCUBUR?
 HERE, I'LL SIT ON THAT
LOG RIGHT THERE.
 I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE TALK
TO ME BECAUSE THEY WANT MY
VOTE.
 HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.
 IT'S GOING GET AWKWARD
AFTER THE FIRST --
ARY IN TROUBLE BECAUSE
THEN THEY WON'T TALK TO ME
AT ALL.
 I'LL STOP TALKING TO YOU.
 I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE
KIND OF LOSE THEIR COOL.
THAT TELLS ME A LOT.
 WHAT THE HELL DID I MISS?
I WAKE UP THIS MORNING-- IS
WHAT I HEARD.
I HEARD ALL OF A SUDDEN A
COUPLE OF GIRLS GOING AT IT.
BETWEEN KASS AND SARAH, I
BELIEVE.
THE FIGHT MADE ME HAPPY
BECAUSE THAT MADE ME REALIZE
THEY WEREN'T AS STRONG A SIX
AS I THOUGHT THEY WERE AND
THEY'RE CRACKING BEFORE WE
EVEN GET TO THE CHALLENGE,
SO WHOA.
SO OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ALL
FEELING A LITTLE BIT
PARANOID.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 WE WERE DISAGREEING ON
WITHOUT WE THINK SHOULD BE
VOTED OUT.
 AND YOU SAID I WILL NOT
VOTE FOR TRISH.
 THAT'S ALL I SAID.
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A
TERRIBLE IDEA.
 I WAS WITH HER FOR 11
DAYS, SHE DOES NOT
STRATEGIZING.
 OKAY.
 I SEE BOTH SIDES.
I DIDN'T WANT US TO GET
FRACTURED OVER SOME, LIKE,
BS.
 WHEN I HEARD ABOUT KASS
AND SARAH'S EXCHANGE, I
DIDN'T CARE WHO WAS RIGHT,
WHO WAS WRONG.
MY MAIN CONCERN WAS GETTING
THOSE TWO BACK ON THE SAME
PAGE.
SO YOU'RE IN A TOUGH
POSITION.
LIKE I RESPECT THAT YOU ARE
IN A VERY PRECARIOUS
POSITION RIGHT NOW.
THOSE WERE YOUR OLD PEEPS.
 I KNOW.
 AND NOW YOU GOT NEW PEEPS
AND NOW EVERYONE IS LIKE
TUGGING AND PULLING.
 WHO DO YOU THINK WE
SHOULD VOTE FOR.
 IF WE ARE NOT VOTING LJ,
TONY, OR WOO.
 I THINK TASHA TOOK
SARAH'S SIDE IN THE
ARGUMENT.
WHAT THE HECK.
SOMEONE IN THE ALLIANCE
TREATS SOMEONE POORLY,
EVERYONE PANDERS TO THE
BULLY.
I FELT LIKE SAYING IT TO
TASHA WA, ABOUT ME, HOW COME
YOU YOU'RE TO THE BEING NICE
TO ME.
WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER.
OH, RIGHT, YOU'RE DONE WITH
ME.
I GOT TESTIMONY.
I GET NERVOUS WHEN SOMEONE
IS I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THIS
PERSON.
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME
NERVOUS AND THEN YOU CALL ME
A BULLY.
I'M NOT BULLYING, I'M TRYING
TO LIKE --
 GUYS, COME ON.
COME ON, GUYS, I DON'T FEEL
LIKE KASS LIKES ME.
 EVERY TIME I SAY
SOMETHING, THAT'S WHAT I GET
IS LIKE-- AND IT'S LIKE,
LIKE YOU ARE ATTACKING ME
SILENTLY LIKE THAT.
 THIS IS ATTACKING YOU
WHEN I'M LIKE WHAT?
 THAT'S AN ATTACK?
 LET ME ASK YOU A
QUESTION.
DOES IT MATTER IF KASS LIKES
YOU?
IF YOU DON'T LIKE KASS, VOTE
KASS OUT.
 I KNOW SARAH IS AGAINST
ME, I KNOW TASHA IS AGAINST
ME.
I KNOW WHERE I STAND.
BUT AT THIS POINT, THE SIX
ARE FALLING PART.
 YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ARE
IN PROBABLY THE MOST PIVOTAL
ROLE IN THIS GAME.
 AND IT SUCKS.
IT SUCKS TO DECIDE THE FATE
OF FIVE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS
GAME.
 AND KNOW IT'S GOING TO
DECIDE YOUR FATE.
 YEAH.
 ARE YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S YOU MINITY
CHALLENGE.
 FIRST THING'S FIRST, I
WILL TAKE BACK TRIBAL
IMMUNITY.
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NO MORE.
THIS IS WHAT YOU SEEK NOW.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
IF YOU HAVE THIS AROUND YOUR
NECK YOU ARE SAFE AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
THERE IS NO BETTER FEELING
IN THE WORLD THAN TO WALK IN
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK.
WITHOUT IT, YOU COULD BE IN
TROUBLE.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE OY
TRIANGULAR PLATFORMS IN THE
WATER.
WITH YOUR FEET PERCHED ON
VERY NARROW FOOTHOLDS.
AT REGULAR INTERVALS WE'LL
MOVE UP, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT.
IF YOU FALL OFF, YOU ARE OUT
OF THE CHALLENGE.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING
WINS IMMUNITY, LOSERS TRIBAL
COUNCIL OR SOMEBODY WILL BE
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
DRAW FOR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
 ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
EVERYBODY TAKE YOUR
POSITIONS.
YOUR FEET ARE GOING TO BE ON
THAT FIRST FOOTHOLD.
HERE WE GO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
EVERYBODY UP.
AN THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.
NO OTHER PART OF YOUR BODY
CAN TOUCH THE STRUCTURE
OTHER THAN YOUR FEET.
THAT MEANS YOUR HANDS, THAT
MEANS YOUR BUTT.
ANY PART OF IT TOUCHES, YOU
ARE OUT.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR
15 MINUTES.
THINK OF THIS AS YOUR WARMUP
ROUND.
GETTING LOOSE.
GET YOUR BODY READY FOR
WHAT'S TO COME.
ALL RIGHT.
MOVE IN TO YOUR NEXT
FOOTHOLD.
YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS NOW
TO HELP YOURSELF GET UP
THERE.
EVERYBODY GET GOOD AND
SOLID.
HERE WE GO.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
EVERYBODY TAKE YOUR
HANDS-OFF.
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.
NOW YOU'RE GOING HAVE TO
GRIN A LITTLE MORE TIGHTLY
TO HOLD ON.
THERE'S LESS ROOM FOR YOUR
FOOT.
STILL LOOKING VERY GOOD.
 WHERE ARE YOU FEELING IT,
LJ?
 EVERYWHERE.
 THIS DEFINITELY ISN'T A
FUN CHALLENGE, JEFF, NOTHING
FUN ABOUT THIS.
A LOT OF PAIN.
 WE WILL GO 15 MINUTES
HERE AS WELL
.
 Jeff: 30 SECONDS LEFT IN
THIS ROUND.
THEN WE MOVE TO THE TOP.
EVERYBODY STILL LOOKING VERY
GOOD.
I'M IMPRESSED.
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING, IT'S
WORKING.
WHATEVER YOU'RE TELLING
YOURSELF TO FIGHT THROUGH
THAT PAIN, KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF.
15 SECONDS, DON'T RELAX AND
DON'T GIVE UP.
YOU WERE THERE, DON'T MAKE A
MISTAKE NOW.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO
MOVE TO THE TOP NOW, YOU CAN
USE YOUR HANDS WE'RE STILL
LIVE THOUGH, IF YOU FALL OUT
AT THIS POINT YOU'RE OUT,
HERE WE GO, WE HAVE 15
SECONDS TO START MAKING YOUR
MOVE.
GET THEM UP THERE, FIVE,
FOUR.
THREE, TWO, ONE.
SPENCER CONDITION HANG ON.
HE CAN'T MAKE THE
TRANSITION.
KASS CAN'T MAKE THE
TRANSITION.
LJ IS IN.
SAR IS-- SARAH IS IN, JEFRA
IS IN, WE'RE DOWN TO SIX.
TASHA IS OUT.
TRISH IS OUT.
FOUR PEOPLE SURVIVE THE
TRANSITION.
JEREMIAH'S IN.
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.
 YOU GOT IT.
 TONY, MORGAN, WOO, GREAT
JOB.
MORGAN, THE WIND KNOCKS HER
OFF.
THE WIND IS COMING UP HUGE!
IT IS CODY AND WOO.
NICE RECOVERY FROM TONY.
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO, TONY AND
WOO.
HUGE BALANCING ACT THAT
THIRD ROUND GOT EVERYBODY
EXCEPT KNEES TWO.
NESS-- THESE TWO.
 HOW ARE YOU FEELING, WOO.
 WHOOO!
 Jeff: YOU GUYS NEED TO
JUST FOCUS.
DON'T GET DISTRACTED.
ANOTHER NICE SAVE BY TONY
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY ON
THE LINE AND SOMEBODY IS
GOING TO EARN IT.
AND TONY GOES IN, THAT IS
IT.
WOO WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY!
 YEAH!
 GOOD JOB.
WOO, COME ON OVER.
RIGHT HERE, FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, WOO IS SAFE
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,
AFTER 19 DAYS SOMEBODY WILL
BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
SHOULD MAKE FOR AN
INTERESTING AFTERNOON.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
WITHIN GOOD JOB, WOO.
 YEAH, YOU HUNG IN THERE,
TONY.
 I HAVE NO IDEA, MAN.
 WOO, GOOD MAN.
 THERE IS 11 PEOPLE.
WE HAVE A SOLLED FIVE, A
SOLID FIVE AND ME.
I HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE
CHOICE.
> I THINK THERE ARE HARDER
COMPETITORS ON TONY'S SIDE.
 I WAS FIRST OFF THE
PEDESTAL.
 AND I WOULD RATHER GO
WITH THE WEAKER SIDE, SO I
AM WITH THE NEW APARRI.
I THINK WE'RE SOILED.
THE ONLY RISK THAT WE HAVE
IS BETWEEN KASS AND I.
 SHALL WE GO OR SHALL WE
WAIT UNTIL LATER.
 I SAY LET'S DO IT TO YOU.
 I WILL MAKE THE DECISION
ON WHO GOES HOME NEXT.
I GET TO DECIDE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW.
 WHO DOW GUYS WANT?
 I THINK JEFRA, THE PERSON
THAT I WOULD THINK WOULD BE
THE SMARTEST WOULD BE JEFRA.
 THAT IS EXACTLY WHO I WAS
THINKING.
 I JUST THINK THERE IS NO
WAY ANYONE IS GOING TO PLAY
AN IDOL ON HER.
 I DONE THINK ANY OF THOSE
GUYS HAVE AN IDOL.
I REALLY DON'T.
I TRULY BELIEVE WE NEED TO
GET RID OF SOMEONE VITAL IN
THE GAME.
JEFRA, I DON'T SEE HER
RUNNING IMMUNITY, WE CAN GET
RID OF HER ANY TIME AND SHE
IS NOT SMART ENOUGH TO PLAY
A STRATEGIC GAME.
TONY IS VERY SMART AND
OBSERVES WHAT IS GOING ON
AROUND HIM.
I THINK MY VOTES ARE EITHER
LJ OR TONY.
 TONY, YOU CAN'T TRUST
SARAH, WE THINK SARAH IS IN
CHARGE NOW.
 RIGHT NOW, THEY PUT HER
UP ON A PEDESTAL BECAUSE
THEY NEED HER VOTE.
AND WE NEED HER VOTE SO I'M
GOING TO PUT HER ON A
PEDESTAL ALSO.
 THERE IS NO WAY SAR IS
EVER LEADING THAT GROUP.
SHE'S SO-- DOWN THERE IT'S
NOT EVEN FUNNY.
 I THINK SHE IS DOWN
THERE.
 SHE IS IN THE MIDDLE
CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.
 BECAUSE SHE IS THE MOST
POWERFUL PLAYER RIGHT NOW.
THEY NEED HER VOTE.
 DOW REALLY THINK YOU CAN
PERSUADE HER TO DROP THOSE
GUYS AND COME OVER HERE.
 I SUGGESTED IT YESTERDAY.
 BUT AS OF TODAY.
DID YOU SEE THAT LITTLE CAT
FIGHT?
THAT THING THAT WENT DOWN
TODAY, I DON'T THINK KASS IS
FEELING TOO COMFORTABLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT COY APPROACH
KASS.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A
PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER.
 I HAVE TO GO TO SARAH
BEFORE ANYONE SAYS THAT, LET
ME TALK TO SARAH, IF YOU ARE
DOWN WITH THAT, I CAN DO
THAT.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK SARAH
THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SHOULD I TRY TO GET KASS.
 I THINK KASS IS GOING TO
PLAY.
 WHAT SERVE DOING TONIGHT.
 I WANT TONY OUT.
 I WOULD GO WITH TONY.
 WHAT IF HE HAS AN IDOL.
 I CAN GUARANTEE TONY
DOESN'T VAN IDOL.
 IF YOU THINK TONY DOESN'T
HAVE IT.
 I CAN GUARANTEE TONY
DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL.
 LET'S STAY WITH TONY
THEN.
 OKAY, OKAY.
AS LONG AS EVERYBODY'S OKAY
WITH IT.
 YEAH.
 THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT
WAS PLAY IT COOL, WE'LL
PROBABLY TAKE OUT JEFRA OR
TRISH TO GET THE NUMBERS.
AND THEN LET'S MEDDLE WITH
THE BIG BOYS WHO MIGHT HAVE
IDOLS OR STRATEGIES.
 I AM GOING TO GO DRIJ
SOME MORE RUM.
 BUT SARAH SAID IT'S GOT
TO BE TONY.
SHE THINKS SHE'S RUNNING THE
SHOW.
 IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN
DO TO POTENTIALLY SAVE
MYSELF HERE?
 YEAH.
IF WE CAN GET IMMUNITY.
 DID NOBODY SEE THIS?
AM I THE ONLY ONE.
 I KNOW SHE IS ABOUT TO
DESTROY THE GAME IF SHE'S
GOING TO DESTROY THE GAME, I
WANT THE-- TO STRIKE, I WANT
TO DESTROY IT.
 ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO
COME ON OUR SIDE --
 THEY ARE TELLING ME THE
EXACT SAME THING.
 BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ME AND
TRISH AND WOO THAT WE
STARTED ORIGINALLY WITH.
 I KNOW.
 YOU DON'T HAVE THAT.
 I KNOW.
AS FAR AS ME AND TRISH ARE
CONCERNED ARE YOU TOP OF
JEFRA, YOU'RE ON TOP OF WOO.
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE YOU,
ME, TRISH AND YOU.
 WELL THIS IS WHAT I WANT
TO DO.
I WANT TO TAKE THIS BACK AND
GET AWAY BY MYSELF AND SIT
DOWN AND THINK ABOUT IT.
 LISTEN, IF YOU AGREE WITH
THEM, LET'S SAY YOU KNOCK
OUT ME, LET'S SAY YOU KNOCK
OUT LJ, ONE OF US,.
 YEAH.
 THAT LEAVES YOU GUYS WITH
SIX, RIGHT.
 6-4, GUESS WHAT, THEY
COULD GET RID OF YOU AND
STILL HAVE FIVE.
THEY DON'T NEED YOU.
YOU GOT NOBODY ON THEIR SID
SIDE-- ON THAT SIDE, SARAH.
 LISTEN, I KNOW THIS.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
GETTING RID OF TONY IS
NOTHING PERSONAL.
IT'S ACTUALLY A HUGE
COMPLIMENT TO HIM.
TONY AND I HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE HE'S A
POLICE OFFICER AND I'M A
POLICE OFFICER.
BUT HE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT
IN THIS GAME.
HE OBSERVES EVERYTHING.
HE'S SNEAKY.
HE'S JUST LIKE ME.
AND I WOULD GET RID OF ME IF
I COULD.
 IF YOU SAY I WANT KASS
GONE, SWEAR ON YOUR BADGE,
YOU COME IN WITH US, WE'LL
MAKE IT HAPPEN.
 YEAH.
 WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
IF YOU TELL ME YOU'RE READY
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WE'LL MAKE
IT HAPPEN.
YOU CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE
GAME RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE
TODAY.
 I KNOW, I KNOW.
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO YOU
THINK I'M CONNING YOU.
 LET ME DIGEST IT.
LET ME-- I'M NOT SAYING NO.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS.
I'M NOT MAKING A DECISION
UNTIL I GET TO TRIBAL.
TONY, IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT
AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
SIT HERE AND FRET ABOUT IT.
 NO, NO, NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M REAL GOOD.
 WHEN SARAH IS TELLING ME
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT, LET
ME MAKE MY DECISION AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE SHE SAID
THAT I LOOK AT HER, YOU KNOW
WHAT, RIGHT, I TALK TO SARAH
AND I GOT A GOOD STRONG
FEELING THAT SHE IS TO THE
COMING ON OUR SIDE SO ONE
THING IS FOR SURE F I FEEL A
LITTLE IFFY, IFFY, THE IDOL
IS BEING PLAYED.
I'M TO THE GOING HOME WITH
THE IDOL.
 YOU'RE ON THE LOW TOTEM
POLE ON THE TEAM.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE
TOP.
 NO, I'VE BEEN REPLACED.
 WELL, YOU KNOW IF THEY
TAKE ONE OF US OUT --
 DO YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN JOINING US?
 DO YOU THINK YOU CAN PULL
IT TOGETHER.
 IF YOU HAD YOUR CHOICE TO
GET ANYBODY OFF THAT TEAM,
WHO WOULD GO GO FOR?
 I WOULD TAKE OUT SARAH.
 YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO
TAKE OUT SARAH MYSELF.
THAT'S WHO WE WANT TO TAKE
OUT.
 IT'S TOTALLY UP TO
YOUMENT BUT I'M JUST
OFFERING YOU.
 YEAH.
 TRISH SLIPPED ME A LITTLE
OF THE OLD MICKEY.
SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO VOTE FOR SARAH.
SURPRISING TO ME.
BUT MAYBE THEY'RE SMARTER
THAN I THINK.
THEY'RE PROBABLY SMARTER
THAN MY OTHER FIVE.
IF THEY'RE THINKING SARAH IS
THE BAD SEED SO MAYBE I WANT
TO SWITCH ALLEGIANCE.
 WE'RE VOTING FOR HER
TONIGHT.
 I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE HI A CONVERSATION
WITH KASS.
I TALKED TO HER.
I ASKED HER.
 THEM TWO ARE FEUDING.
 I SAID TO HER IF YOU ARE
GOING TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT
TONIGHT, WHO WOULD YOU VOTE.
SHE SAID SARAH, I SAID KASS,
I'M BEGGING YOU TO COME WITH
US.
SHE SAID I THINK ITS IT'S
TOO LATE TO PUT TOGETHER.
I SAID NO IT IS NOT.
 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
DO.
 SARAH.
 SARAH IS OUR VOTE
TONIGHT.
 WE'RE VOTING SARAH, IF
ARE YOU IN WITH US, YOU'RE
IN WITH US AND WE WILL TAKE
CARE OF YOU.
TRUST ME.
 I LOVE THAT SARAH THINKS
SHE'S RUNNING THE SHOW.
NEW APARRI IS VOTING FOR
TONY AS THE REQUEST OF QUEEN
SARAH.
SOLANA IS VOTING FOR SARA.
I TRULY BELIEVE I'M THE ONE
IN THE MIDDLE.
I THINK I HAVE USURPED
SARAH'S THRONE TONIGHT AND
ONCE AGAIN, CHAOS KASS WILL
SHOW UP AT TRIBAL.
 ALL RIGHT, LJ, WHERE ARE
WE AT?
WHAT IS THE MOOD OF THIS
GROUP OF 11?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE
HOTTEST SEAT IN TOWN RIGHT
NOW.
AND IF I DO G I'M HIGHLY
FLATTEREDnd IT'S THE BEST
WORST COMPLIMENT YOU COULD
EVER GET BY BEING THE
BIGGEST THREAT IN THE GAME.
 THAT IS A FAREWELL SPEECH,
HE'S READY TO GO.
SNUFF HIS TORCH.
 AT THIS PORTION OF THE
GAME ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE
BIGGEST THREAT.
SO HE SHOULD BE WORRIED.
 Jeff: TONY, YOU HAVE THE
ORIGINAL APARRI WHO HAVE
BEEN ALL SEPARATED EXCEPT
FOR SARAH AND THE NEW APARRI
AND THE NEW SOLANA, ARE YOU
NOTICING DIFFERENT GROUPS OF
PEOPLE MERGING TOGETHER?
 I'M NOTICING THAT JUST A
GROUP OF SMART PEOPLE
PLAYING AND I'M HOPING YOU
THEY REALIZE IF YOU DON'T
MOVE FORWARD WITHIN AN
ALLIANCE OF NUMBERS, YOU
MOVE FORWARD WITH AN
ALLIANCE OF COMFORT, WHO ARE
YOU HAPPY TO BE AROUND,.
 Jeff: IT SOUNDS LIKE ARE
YOU A BIT WORRIED FOR
YOURSELF.
 THAT'S THE TRUTH, I AM A
LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT
TONIGHT.
I AM AM COULDING WERE FROM A
TRIBE OF LOWER NUMBERS AND I
COULD BE POTENTIALLY A
THREAT OUT HERE.
I KNOW I'M 40 AND BALD AND
OLD BUT I STILL HAVE A
LITTLE FIRE IN ME.
 Jeff: KASS, DOES IT MAKE
SENSE FOR LJ AND TONY TO BE
CONCERNED GIVEN THAT THERE
ARE SIX IN ONE GROUP AND
FIVE ON ANOTHER.
 YEAH, I WOULD BE VERY
CONCERNED IF I WERE A STRONG,
MALE DOING WELL IN CHALLENGES
ON THE MINORITY GROUP.
 Jeff: LJ, WHERE DO IDOLS
COME INTO PLAY?
DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN
FOUND.
DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY HAS
ONE?
 THE FACT THAT NO IDOL HAS
APPEARED, THIS COULD BE SOME
BIG SURVIVOR JOKE, I'M NOT
SURE.
 Jeff: MEANING THERE
AREN'T ANY?
 THERE'S IDOLS, KUZ I GOT
ONE.
AND I'M GOING USE IT FOR MY
TRIBE.
 Jeff: YOU HAVE AN IDOL.
 OF COURSE I DO.
 YEAH, YOU WANT TO PULL IT
OUT.
 WHAT'S THAT GOING TO
PROVE.
 Jeff: THAT YOU ARE
TELLING THE TRUTH.
 AND WHAT IS THAT GOING TO
GET ME.
 WELL, YOU JUST TOLD US
THAT YOU HAVE ONE, SO --
 ALL RIGHT.
THIS RIGHT HERE.
INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW,
INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO SEE.
RIGHT HERE, ALL RIGHT?
I'M GOING TO WEAR IT WITH
PRIDE.
AND THIS DOESN'T MEAN I'M
GOING USE IT FOR ME, JEFF.
I COULD GIVE IT TO LJ, I
COULD GIVE TO TO JEFRA,
TRISH.
 Jeff: IT'S A COMMUNITY
IDOL.
SO YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE TONIGHT.
 IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG
MOVE.
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THESE
SIX FACES, LOOK AT WHAT IS
GOING ON RIGHT HERE, JEFF.
LOOK AT THEM, LOOK AT THEM.
 Jeff: NOW YOU HAVE
SPONSOR AND TASHA CHANGING A
VOTE.
 THEY COULD CHANGE
ANYTHING THEY WANT.
 Jeff: A LOT OF JABBERING
STILL GOING ON.
 WE NEED A SECOND.
I NEED A SECOND.
 THE OTHER ONE.
 Jeff: LOOK AT THIS.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: SHALL WE JUST END
THE SUSPENSE AND GET TO THE
VOTE.
 ABSOLUTELY.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
VOTING FOR THE OTHER ONE.
 I LOVE WHEN A VOTE IS
THIS ALIVE.
 Jeff: IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TRISH?
YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS AN A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE
TIME TO DO SO.
 CAN YOU VALIDATE IT FOR
ME, PLEASE, JEFF.
 Jeff: YES, THIS IS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
 I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT
TO LJ.
LET'S SEE IF I READ THESE
PEOPLE CORRECTLY, JEFF.
 Jeff: ANY VOTES CAST FOR
LJ WILL NOT COUNT.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO
LEAVE THE COUNCIL TRIBAL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.
 HOLD ON.
 Jeff: YES.
 I WOULD LIKE TO COVER
TONY'S ASS MYSELF.
 YO, MY MAN.
 I HATE YOU GUYS.
 SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, I
THINK YOU WERE THE OTHER MAN,
MY FRIEND.
 Jeff: THERE IS ALSO A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL SO ANY
VOTES FOR TONY WILL NOT
COUNT EITHER.
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE
OTHER MAN, LET'S SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
 Jeff: I'LL READ THE VOTES.
 Jeff: FIRST VOTE JEFRA.
SARAH.
JEFRA.
SARAH.
TWO VOTES JEFRA, TWO VOTES
SARAH.
JEFRA.
SARAH.
WE'RE TIED AGAIN, THREE
VOTES JEFRA, THREE VOTES

MEMBER OF OUR JURY, SARAH.

 Jeff: SARAH, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.
TIME FOR TO YOU GO.
 THANKS.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 THANKS, SARAH.
 KASS, KASS, THANK YOU.
 THAT IS RIGHT, CAST, GOOD
JOB.
WE LOST TWO IMMUNITY IDOLS
BUT WE'LL GET THEM BACK
AGAIN.
> KASS, ZERO CHANCE OF
WINNING THE GAME.
 A LONG WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: WELL IT IS CLEAR
THAT THIS WAS A SHOCKING
VOTE AND MY PREDICTION IS IT
IS GOING TO BE A WILD
FINISH.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.
 SHE HAS BEEN BEING RUDE
TO ME.
 A WAR OF WORD FORCE TWO
SURVIVORS.
 LESS'S JUST A BITTER,
UGLY OLD LADY.
 BUT IT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO THE CHAOS OF A HIDDEN
IDOL.
 IT'S A MAD TREASURE HUNT
FOR THIS IDOL.
 I'M GOING TO PULL OUT MY --
 I WAS SITTING THERE CALM
AS CAN BE, WAITING FOR JEFF
TO PULL OUT THAT LAST NAME,
AND I TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN IT
SAID SARAH, I WAS LIKE HUH?
WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID
SET OF SIX.
I DON'T KNOW WHY KASS
FLIPPED.
BUT, THEY GOT ME GOOD.
