They will play smart, thin and
are going to play well.
Welcome to Survivor: Cagayan.
You have been divided into three tribes
based on three qualities
needed to succeed in this game:
Strength, Intelligence and Beauty.
Black woman,
What is your name?
- Morgan.
- Morgan.
Looking just lal other people
if I had to choose,
which of the three would you say you are?
Beauty, Intelligence or Strength?
Not to sound conceited but I think we are
Beauty.
Go to the end .
The guy behind green.
- Tell me.
- They are Beauty.
Where encajáis you think?
I guess we're the nerds
I do not know.
I Based on what?
Based on
they seem really fit.
That leaves the middle group. You must be
Force.
The guy in the gray shirt,
What is your name?
- Tony.
- Do you think all right, do you agree?
I accept with pleasure.
What do you like to be
Tribe of Force?
'll Stomp on Beauty
y
will stomp on Intelligence.
I love.
This season will test your putting skills
To draw different lines
Strength, Intelligence and Beauty
adaptáis while you in the game time
a time, starting now
.
Let's choose a leader in each tribe.
If you have not had time to talk
all you can do
is mediros
to each other just look at you.
Start by Beauty.
Decide, Whom will ye that I represent as a tribe
?
I think
I'm thinking of you, big brother.
Type black hat,
seems to be you.
- What is your name?
- LJ.
LJ, how does it feel, to
seconds into the game,
have been selected as the type
will represent the tribe sexy?
Clearly
I am in the beauty center of the group.
If I am the man who excels,
we have to.
Come to the center, the Force.
Who is talkative?
- Are you talkative?
- I am talkative.
Who will it be?
- Sarah.
- Sarah, the girl later.
- The Woman in yellow, what's your name?
- Trish.
Trish, why Sarah?
Seems very confident.
Seems to do a good job.
Well, we go with the third tribe.
Who will represent
tribe Intelligence?
Who looks the smartest?
You look it.
Why American?
What do you think?
Do you agree?
- Sounds good to me, I'm yours.
- Here we go.
- Well, come on.
- It's yours, it's yours.
- What is your name?
- David.
Well, the woman in the rear.
What's your name?
- Kass.
- Kass, why David?
Personally never trust a man in a suit
but I like David,
so go with this.
So we have our three leaders.
Now the game will return
a little more complicated.
The leaders of each group will choose
who is the weakest of the group.
If you have to to throw off somebody who would be
?
Suddenly be the leader is not a
position you would want to be.
LJ, let's start with you.
Initially this game is about physical challenges
and if I have to choose...
'll tell Morgan.
Morgan go.
This should not happen to often
in life.
First for everything.
Take a stand this side, Morgan.
In my perspective on Beauty
there be good and be cute.
Morgan, is good 
While the other girls are cute 
And personally, I hope to be more mona
that be good .
We now join the tribe of Force.
Sarah establishments based on first impressions
,
to whom
you'll miss this tribe?
've Had good vibes from them all.
I mean, this really sucks
position.
But without more knowledge...
Women yellow.
- Trish, right?
- Yes
Trish, you were the first person to speak
by Sarah
and she has been the
who brought you.
Okay.
I understand.
If so
as she feels it is so.
Well, a tribe left.
Let the tribe of intelligence.
David, because your
American obviously
were chosen leader of this group.
Just for the record, the American
home with no pants
so it's not a costume.
Are you accustomed to making decisions
well, David?
Tomo and decisions
often and I'll choose you to him.
Well, you have not even thought about it
.
The guy in green,
What is your name?
- Garret.
- Garret.
David, I must say that from here
that has been a surprising choice.
What have you based?
Focusing on the last two thirds of the game
.
So you're looking at the end.
Good
you have asked me to make a decision now
but take any decision should be based
on what is good for now
and what will be good for later.
Well, Garret, assumes a position
here with Trish.
My strategy in choosing
Garret is looking a truck 
but also has brains, would not 
That would be a formidable mixture.
So I figured it would make sense
rid of it 
This is fast changing as Survivor.
If this had been a
Tribal Council you Three:
Morgan, Trish, Garret,
you would be out of this game.
Fortunately for you, this is not a
Tribal Council.
You are not out of the game.
Nor are you out of your tribe.
But you're not going to go with them to the camp
.
Vais up to the helicopter,
going to fly and will arrive before the camp
.
And ye shall take a decision in favor of the tribe
just votaros.
Now, are the three tribes
which they are concerned,
wondering that you will have done.
Get your things, get in the helicopter
. Good luck.
Well, for the rest of you
I have maps at your new home.
Tribe Beauty ye Solana.
Force, you are Aparri.
Intelligence, you are Luzan.
The good news is that you have a great time in your
first day.
Get your stuff,
id camp,
Begin to build your shelter.
Could be a water
last season, good luck.
Be isolated from the group as fast
sucks 
At least the other two leaders 
seemed sad to have to choose a person .,
but David did not even hesitate 
Immediately he grabbed me and said
'Garret is the weakest.'
What is all a lie, I'm more
stronger than any of them 
Here it is.
'You have a decision to make.'
'You can help yourself
or help your tribe.'
Well, we can cross this second part
.
I'm definitely going to help me.
'If you choose to help the tribe,
will give you a second bag of rice.'
'If you choose will help you
it, you will be given
a clue to the location of
hidden immunity idol '
As for me, I'm paragraph
of the group 
or so I think.
Obviously I will look
the immunity idol.
Let's see what we have here.
Dice straight.
When people see my body normally think
: 
'It's just an idiot.' 
But when I was in college 
did the SAT test and got almost . perfectly 
Y to live, I'm a professional poker player
.
So to
everything I do in life, go for it 
'
Find the place where the waters fall.'
'So go to the waterfall '
No doubt the decision that took David
has played in my favor 
But he is a threat and I want to get
. the game 
When
Sarah had to choose the weakest of the tribe, 
looked around, and I'm clearly older
,
I am also thinner.
Was not surprised to be 
'If you choose to help yourself you will be given same
a clue to the location...
Oh, damn!
Shit.
When I saw the note was
as: My God 
I have to make a decision either
or my computer 
. At first, I could
hear me say, 'Do not be stupid, 
sees the idol for you
yourself and protect yourself.' 
God, I am not so selfish,
but may have to be.
've Been divorced for 15 years, 
raising my children emotionally and financially
Has been hard 
Still, while I've always been
A team player.
This is how I am.
You know what?
I'm going to choose to help the team.
'm Spending the idol.
I will follow my instincts
and I'll go with the team 
Hope I'm not pulling the rest of the game
overboard for this,
but nothing
I can do now.
Just hope no need to repent 
God.
I'm surprised.
I was voted the first 
I think I have more physical and
force the other two girls,
and I can have the kids eating out of my hand
.
But maybe LJ
felt tempted by my side 
and decided to walk away. It would be a
headache for him. 
in that what I'm good.
Maybe he can feel this.
I hold grudges big.
Will never forgive you for this 
'Stroll down the rocks'.
This is a game where you have
to save yourself, so 
of course will find the Idol 
guess I'm a selfish person, but 
if I can find it, it will be
a powerful game changer, for sure 
clearly going to have to
get dirty and get wet in the water.
Clue to the idol said
straight waterfall 
Unfortunately, this search
is not my area of ​​expertise.
Situations I've been in poker 
You a lot of money gambled
and I have not stressed about it 
So this should be a game . of children 
It's killing me not being able to find
that stupid idol now.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
I feel something!
What is this?
Let's see what we have here.
Immunity idol!
Finally I was able to find the Idol 
Since then I
I'm staying for me 
Was the start of play amazing.
'The immunity idol will keep you safe
Being kicked by Tribal Council'
Having the immunity idol
puts me in a good position 
I do not know what the hell I was thinking David
but I promise, I will do
everything 
in my power to get rid of it 
said track
immunity idol 
< i>
be here near the rocks 
So when
thought the great rock that stands 
right of our camp . 
There are many small cracks,
crannies, and gaps in
could be the idol.
But I can not reach my companions when
Not know how much time do I have
.
Only 
I know I have to find him 
When we got to the beach we asked where it was Morgan
Not walked anywhere and was
very suspicious.
Was by climbing the rocks 
as they arrived and I saw my fellow tribesmen
I almost miss the
Heart scare 
've been looking for a good time
Idol 
and I thought if I come back with something when they are
, 
sure I'm going home 
- Look at that!
- Madremía.
This is our humble abode.
I wonder where is Morgan.
My companions arrived 
Was pretty obvious what I was doing 
They have already made known to me
I'm the weakest person
and now I'm looking behind the idol.
I thought I was over 
I wonder what decision had to be made.
Then I realized that I could just lie and say
:
'I chose the material for shelter and things
Fishing
rather than things to be comfortable.'
Here it comes.
I hope you guys like what I chose.
What did you decide?
Chose rice,
things for the shelter and fishing.
- Wow.
- Good choice.
Course that I took them by the hair 
Now the days
I want to find the idol.
I have to be very careful with that
,
I do not think they have a clue.
It had tidal pools and
went to see them, had among the rocks.
- Yes?
- Great.
Morgan in lingerie and goes,
like a mermaid leaves the sea.
Which makes me a little nervous
because it is very calm and serene
For someone who was 'expelled' 
= = Let's thirst soon.
- It's what I was thinking.
- So...
- Fire and shelter?
- Yes
Let's see where we make fire.
A two, or has the immunity idol
o have a clue, hence
have that behavior.
Because it could be the sexy girl resentful.
My name is LJ.
Hope you do not
what you will take it personally.
Do not worry, I only
prove you wrong.
Okay.
Morgan
was able to provide some good things.
I think that
has increased their confidence a little.
But I'm not a nerd,
I recognize a gypsy when I see it.
So was the perfect opportunity for me 
to use my charms to win her.
I do not have expelled
so you know.
- Is a geezer so...
- Yeah, right.
I think they are already seeing what couples are
.
Those two and those two.
So if two two
- I'm with you.
- Okay.
Brice and I connected a little .
time we'll be together.
He cares for me, and
see what happens.
People do not expect anything from us 
because we have been labeled as the spunky 
Think it's just a tribe of princesses
and
guys who are handsome and do not like getting dirty.
Va guys going, what are you doing
well, we have a waiting coconut!
Keep blowing, man.
- You have?
- Come on, man.
Father, help us to get
fire.
We got it, buddy.
Was so excited, we just start fire
No flint, what is it quite difficult to get
So I love my tribe.
- You guys are the bomb.
- Bump that.
Other tribes not think the tribe Beauty 
and success are bound hand.
But it is happening, we can do
great and we are doing 
Thanks for letting me out, Sarah.
- I'm sorry.
- OK.
No problem, I knew I had to take a decision
at a time.
- I get it.
- I'm sorry.
- Please do not give him more laps.
- How are you?
Okay.
As had been seen as weak
group 
I thought that's what they were going to be
thinking when they came to the camp
this older woman thin we remove
weak.
So I had to do something to win them
I actually had the opportunity to go to find the idol
but I thought
in the group and I got a bag over rice .
I knew you would.
As soon arrived at camp
Trish welcomed us with open arms 
He said he had the opportunity to go for the
idol for her
o help the tribe and
get a second bag of rice.
Was so excited, he said he did
right 
But if it had been in place
Trish 
only there had been a bag from
rice and an idol in my pocket.
Who wants to start with the shelter?
- I think we should start.
- Divide tasks.
- Yes, it is good idea.
- We choose different things.
Looking to all my fellow Tribe
you might say 
any challenge
appearance will undoubtedly dominate.
We have the greatest of all man
Measures like about eight feet.
What do you do for a living
, Cliff?
Working in sports marketing.
Rather should play.
I played a little basketball.
I have a couple of your cards,
I'm not going to lie.
'm A fan of basketball 
and when I recognized who it was: Cliff Robinson.
Played at Portland Trail Blazers,
and was one of my players
Favorites when I was young 
All seem very happy to have you with us 
but give more importance 
What team did you play?
I played with the Portland Trail Blazers.
- Great!
- After Phoenix Sun.
And the Detroit Pistons.
That
is a former basketball player can hurt me 
but to tell you the truth did not seem
that nobody cared about that.
So for me that's good 
I play without worrying that my fellow
judge me for what I did.
I only see my
as Cliff Robinson 
A fellow Tribe in Survivor 
Tell me how you want it to.
When you have it
not have enough oxygen, so
blow on a bit.
Police have been for a while 
And they have a profile on what Tony has
If I'm wrong, a cop should be
because it has the physical.
Can I have a moment to look
and be honest with me?
- Are you a cop?
- Gonna.
- I swear it?
- I swear.
- You look like one of them.
- Well, if you want I am.
- Why?
- I swear it?
I promise, why?
- Do not lie to.
- What do you do?
- A construction.
- Ya.
- Where?
- It's what I mainly in Jersey City.
you have the look of a cop.
I have a tattoo and they do not.
- How do you know?
- Because I have many police friends.
- Do not you have friends cops?
- Yes, of course.
I am at least 50
friends who are cops.
For a moment I wondered:
I say I'm a cop 
But if I say that I am
first thing they think is that I'm
a strategic man
tactical, clever, and very observant,
and will be right.
With what clearly will be a threat to them
and certainly surprised me immediately.
- And what you decicas you, Sarah?
- I'm a cop.
- Really?
- Yes
Interviews and Interrogations 
are my daily routine 
and I lie every day at work.
Something makes me feel uncomfortable with Tony
're A good girl to be honest.
- You want me to tell you the truth?
- Yes
I'm not a cop.
You're lying.
- I do not.
- Sure.
Did you think I was going to say what
that goes.
- Gonna tell me you're a cop.
- Come on, woman!
I have no idea what
is dedicated.
All I know is I do not think
I can trust him,
So you have to go as soon as possible
, 
is everything
I have to say 
What's up, guys?
God, joy
you're with us!
Va, a small group hug.
I had to, man.
When David said he had to choose
Garret 
I thought I was an idiot.
You are throwing the guy who can help us
challenges
ostracized and bring it around
start, it's a terrible move 
Did you have to make a decision?
Yes, and got some things.
I found where the water is
And there is a waterfall there.
Great.
- Is there a waterfall?
- Yes, there is.
- No shit.
- He's throwing around.
I'm not going to sit here and say I'm pretending
architect
Because
I have no idea of ​​making a shelter.
I am a nuclear engineer.
- Really?
- Yes
're an engineer, go.
And I have an idea for the shelter.
- Do you?
- Yes
- A small plan.
- Nice.
We go!
Got my Ph.D. in nuclear engineering 
so I think I'm the smartest person here
.
Undoubtedly.
'll Build that shelter 
I will not make the cut bamboo
but I will tell you how to do it
and will be a wonderful refuge
.
You have to put four poles
like almost a meter high.
So I want you to cortéis
as eight pieces of bamboo.
First thing I need the base.
Okay.
Garret , cut that thing.
Take the following from there.
We have to find another that is that size.
- Well.
- Okay.
- Go.
- Good.
J'Tia took the role of leader 
And his approach is not the brightest
because it is very belligerent and bossy.
Go for bamboo.
That seems a little big,
why not make a smaller one?
No, turn it over.
There we are.
Okay, now raise
palm leaves and piles of stones.
All we have left are the long parts
.
Right now we have an engineer, J'Tia,
telling us that can make a shelter.
I do not think we can dig
there, and digging is the most important factor.
That, right there.
Has the character of a leader, 
is a bossy course.
But I think something is missing here.
This is not going to be able to endure
.
Look...
- All of our weight...
- We weighed as 226 kilos.
Yes, we weigh that. But bamboo is
strong and is the basis of the refuge.
Okay, I need from bamboo.
J'Tia
I do not like his attitude at all 
I think anyone,
makes you feel uncomfortable.
Is quite bossy.
- Enough indeed.
- But it does not do anything.
Yes, and I let her do what she wants
.
Do you understand?
- That's my plan.
- And mine.
J'Tia was put in charge of doing things but only
nozzle.
We only
is barking orders.
In my career, I've had enough experience
with people looking thinking that single
things are done.
Is believed that puts all there,
and magically everything is done
.
So J'Tia 
This is not going to take a long time
, let and eager.
Need to do, so
get to it.
Must be done.
J'Tia is too, too
.
Let me check the balance.
Madremía.
There has not been a good move for
Intelligent Tribe.
Come on, guys!
Are you ready for your
first immunity challenge?
-
Yes - of course.
For today's challenge you are going to maneuver
a cart through an obstacle course
Each post will have
that you get a key, 
You will wear that to open the chest, 
shall put the hood on the car and you will continue 
Once you succeed
three chests will have to disassemble 
the car, pass it through the barricade
, 
reassemble and reach the goal 
Where two people use
parts chests 
solving a puzzle
giant dragon 
Want to know so that you play?
-
Yes - Of course.
Immunity.
's What lust in this game.
If you have immunity,
you can not be expelled.
The first two tribes

A unless the Tribal Council.
Between someone losers will be the first person

Also you are going to play

Has the closely fought thing,
for some and for others
between Strength and Beauty.
- Well done, girls.

A Force-six.
're About to end.
Beauty

A Beauty remaining two pieces.

And they succeed!
Beauty, Solana tribe wins immunity

The tribe
Intelligence is neither close to finishing the puzzle.
Luzon

Will lose its first member.
Ehnorabuena Solana,
immunity is yours.
No Tribal Council tonight.
Aparri, ehnorabuena.
No Council have tonight.
Solana, come and pick your team to fire
.
Aparri shaped fire flint
.
- There you doing, Tony.
- Thank you, sir.
Get your things and come back to campento.
Enjoy the night.
Good luck gunning.
Okay Luzon, someone of you will be
first person voted out of Survivor Cagayan.
Take your things and go back to camp,
I see you tonight in the Council.
I did wrong on that obstacle.
Instead have gone above
I should have taken all we have
things and go.
- Can not underestimate...
- To the other tribes.
We can not keep saying stupid things like:
- 'We are smarter than them.'
- No, no.
We kicked ass.
Fatal challenge did .
And indeed I can not throw
blame anyone in particular.
I think it's everybody's fault.
We know very well the theory 
but when we come to practice are fools
We did exactly as we have been doing these
three days.
- I did not...
- No execution.
We had assigned to people for everything.
J'Tia took the first key.
To tell him.
I thought you were the one who was responsible for
keys.
And it was.
Literally grabbed as she's falling.
- But not off the chains.
- I know.
...
But is that any executions.
Add
forget that but what I really want to talk about is...
J'Tia or Garret.
That was a physical challenge
and Garret was not helping.
Personally I would get rid of Garret 
I see that is a major threat to me than
J'Tia 
'm thinking of the day 39.
And my biggest concern is that I do not know
you have in mind 
Not been told anything 
And that terrifies me to death.
Just think about it.
- No, J'Tia.
- Garret.
- No, without hesitation.
- Good.
- This time...
- For harmony, the harmony in the tribe.
I just want to tell J'Tia later.
I do not want to be with you.
David wants you to go Garret
first 
But that's ridiculous.
Is our strongest guy. 
Worker addition is 
But J'Tia not done anything
's Been running a lot, but
production.
All see 
's Dead weight.
So enviémosla home.
Wow, that sucks.
What do you think,
who want to take?
Do you agree
while lest thou?
To be honest,
I'm thinking of you.
Because you have not provided much in the camp
.
You tell us what lot do
but I do not see doing anything.
I think I brought what I had
to contribute in the challenge.
Well, you
stayed three days doing nothing.
- Bringing...
- Your opinion is more than welcome.
- Y. ..
- Right.
It's just that I'm an honest person.
And I understand perfectly.
And I appreciate it.
So
Time to shake things up, I guess.
I went to talk to Kass,
and was very direct 
I said not much to
Camp 
and I went home 
Kass That it hurt my feelings a bit different
.
I'm not a vague.
Need shelter
And I thought it was the
all started to do 
but had not done 
I thought I was
which motivated.
Y
is clear that things were not.
But I hope it has not ruined my options
may still have them.
- What's up, girl?
- I think I'm finished.
I just wanted to talk to Kass.
And I said I wanted to leave.
- Did he say that?
- Yes
Do you think I do not
enough at camp?
Well, there was a moment in which
were sitting
and only
dedicabas you to give orders.
And I think that has
bothered people.
- Girls, all right?
- Yes, come and sit.
- I feel a little anxious.
- Yes
But the thing is that you always fear
.
-
Yes - I am too.
Far But I know you're safe.
Look at me, look at me.
I'm not lying.
If you ask me, David is the greatest strategic threat
among us
-
Yes - But if we vote together
David would go home.
And all will be better, right?
J'Tia is very paranoid right now 
And from what I have
a good reason for it.
Bossy, not
get along with everyone 
Truth
I care less about her than others
because my concern and how far I
= = the greatest threat is David 
smart 
I think it is a maquinante 
has made clear that he wants to get rid of my
So David is going home tonight
.
May be bossy, but I'm loyal
.
You and I have no problems.
Tash, J'Tia you and you get along.
So I'll talk to Spencer.
- Bringing all well.
- Yes
is not something I've organized
but I think we should vote for David.
Well, what worries me is that...
would not have heard anything about
clues to the idol or something?
Nothing, why -
It just seems strange that at this point
not know anything about it.
Ya.
I would think that there is some track somewhere.
Would be a disaster if David found it.
Yes
Is that something you noticed he has
been looking around or something?
Well, they both have been around
alone
and is quite clever,
and I have no idea
whether it is above, so...
true.
I worry quite 
vote for David 
I know that in the past have been
tracks and idols through the camp.
Keep seeing David and Kass
leaving for a walk and I've noticed it
So I'm a little
worried that you found 
So I think that since
J'Tia is a constant pain 
vote for her,
it safe . 
is a risk not
need today.
Because it would be a disaster if it plays a
idol and one of us goes home.
Yes
Spencer gives many turns that David has
Idol 
Which is ridiculous, because I have
Idol .
And of course I'm going to say 
But now I'm nervous
to vote for David 
because I do not know if we have
four votes tonight.
Rain is coming, guys.
Yes
Undoubtedly, David
is a big threat 
And if people do not see it, is that they are idiots
not know tell you 
hope Spencer and I stay together, 
but we'll see what happens 
Behind you there is a torch, pick one,
closer to the fire and on.
This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council
,
because in this game the
fire represents your life.
When the fire is extinguished,
you too.
That will be the case one
of you tonight.
What?
Was a huge spider, nothing.
So you're saying that
everything you've been through
you scared of a spider?
The above him!
Let's talk about the early days.
J'Tia since I see you smiling.
Wow, knew you'd talk me
much tonight, Jeff.
Why think that?
Because some people have in mind for me
expel.
And here we are, so
think you're in trouble.
Yeah right, Kass said I was thinking about my
.
I said it was not useful at camp
.
Y
do not know how I said that.
'm An engineer,
I came with an idea
and thought it would work.
a good plan to make the shelter, Jeff.
I was directing people.
Is that not be helpful, I was sending
?.
I understand that nobody
I like to give orders
and shelter
literally collapsed in front of me.
David, how has it been for you to deal with
J'Tia?
Wine eager,
said nuclear was
or nuclear or something like constructura.
So I said:
'Wow, we have to listen.'
Y was well until one time
stopped going well.
Yes, J'Tia.
I am nuclear engineer,
thanks David.
Never said I had made shelters before,
but had a plan in mind and had
eager to carry it out.
J'Tia a moment ago you were
Which he said were responsible for the
get it wrong.
Immediately
David confirms that you cut him short.
No, no, no.
I know my plan did not work.
And I'm sorry, but
I do what I can.
I think I'm a person thrust forward
,
if I'm talking too much,
I have to say I street.
I'm always open to suggestions,
want it success as a tribe.
Let's talk about the first time, to start the game
David had to choose the weaker person
Tribe.
And the second you said Garret.
I realized it was not the best situation
be
and decided to act quickly and decisively
and you have to do here,
step forward because
Listener :
This is a game.
Bringing Garret, how you sat
to be one of the strongest guys here
David and I did not even think for a second
?
Sino read:
'Garret is the weakest'.
Fatal, it is never fun to be
considered the worst.
And that happened three minutes
arrived, it was not fun.
Is there any part of you that think
what happens
is you're dangerous and they want out?
No.
I trust my team.
David, do you think it's okay
Garret sure?
Yes
Do not you going tonight?
Not today.
J'Tia So, now that we are approaching
to vote.
What if you?
The first expelled.
Would be disastrous, I came here to play
and if you talk to get away as a tribe
just can not think at the end of the game.
You have to think in the beginning as
and go through it.
Think That comment refers in the final
commentary to David to start
'
I'm thinking long-term. "
Yes, and this is my tribe.
These are my people, and
someone has to go.
I understand, but -
But you will not be you.
Not for nothing even remotely
.
Then who?
David.
David, I just say clearly
.
Yes, it's what happens when
know you will be expelled,
is what you do. P. ..
If you think you're going to be expelled
, I was wrong.
Bringing
Spencer clearly an important vote.
Survivor The gods are talking about.
Spencer.
Yes, everything is reduced as
wants this tribe move forward.
So we have to vote in mind:
a
who must drive to go further?
Is difficult, but at the end of the day
have to go with the
people whom you trust.
Okay, it's time to vote.
Kass, you go first.
In the real world, maybe I would have hired
,
but in this world, not
tonight.
I'll get the votes.
Sl someone has the immunity idol and wants to play
,
now would be the time to do so.
Well, once
read the decision is final,
The expelled person
must leave the area immediately Council.
Read the votes.
Once read the decision is final,
the ejected person must leave
Council area immediately.
Read the votes.
First Vote...
J'Tia.
David.
J'Tia.
David.
Draw.
J'Tia Two votes, two votes
David.
Three helpful David, J'Tia two votes, one vote is
.
First person voted out of Survivor Cagayan:
David,
you have to bring me your torch.
Unbelievable.
David, the tribe has spoken.
's Time for you to leave.
Hopefully after the vote today
will direct you to the address that you need
because you have to be united soon
And
I do not mean only the shelter.
The good news of the Council is
that have shaped flint fire.
Take your things and come back to
camp, which may rest.
I do not regret.
I played the way I thought
Play needed to go further 
tribe did not like me 
< . i> O were united only
to go against me 
But I have no hard feelings against any of them
I consider myself the luckiest person
world.
Does anyone have any suggestions for the fire?
Let's start the party.
Last Council was a lot of silly arguments
In the end, the real goal was to send David
home.
And we were able to get it.
But I'm not having fun playing Survivor
Not being funny to me right now
,
have to be honest.
Ask 
work in the camp is not funny, 
starve either 
What it is not being an experience
. good for me 
Just remember, everything is reduced to oxygen
.
So when you do make sure you pass
air.
- You separate them a bit.
- Yes
When I play poker I do
from a comfortable chair, 
bring food directly to the table 
I want to play Survivor
to be better and smarter than the rest 
But I want to play Survivor
to survive in the jungle.
Say we have a council tonight.
And we have to Kass.
Then expulsaríamos to one of the two girls, right?
The Council was perfect.
- Right.
- Because he was fighting with Tasha.
No longer actually falls J'Tia well.
With what I think the
Council put us in a good position.
Kass
last night was definitely surprised to see that David was going 
Y Spencer and I are thinking that if we
to expel someone we have several options.
= = J'Tia and Tasha 
But I also believe that I can not trust
Kass 
So maybe we get rid of it.
You know I like to be with two or more allied
people.
But from the beginning.
-
Yes - Yes
The Council was... interesting.
Petty treason David and I 
But what I think is
I'm the one that decides
and they know it.
I think I see that makes sense for you to be
Us
and certainly think it makes sense for us to have you
.
Guys are going to stay together and the girls
more of the same 
And where does that leave me?
In the deciding vote.
Forgetting what happened
- we now have a solid three.
- Yes
- And we'll be fine.
- I agree.
Spoke with Garret and Spencer
but I'm not with them 100% .
I will study
all my chances.
Same Now I'm not with anyone.
- Deal?
- Finalists?
Can do the bullshit
colliding hands 
I do not care 
The game is running, until I
We go to 
Let's do this, buddy.
Okay, Woo.
Woo and help us to get the boat
We wanted to ride on the boat
last a couple of days.
There was an
desire to get out and try to catch some fish.
Look at the guys seem true
locals, do not you think?
Yes, we'll see what becomes
.
So how can we turn back?
For there to row
to the left to go right.
Want to go Pier there?
Yes, let's go see
is there.
Okay.
Woo I like him.
And you have to have a partner 
Robin Batman always had. Jordan had Pippin
Cliff Woo has.
Woo Tang.
So you have to take care of your partner
and do what it takes to follow.
Are you okay?
Everything was going well 
but lost the balance in the pot.
And suddenly...
Hey.
Do me a favor,
Can you bend it?
Was overturned and we have water inside.
And how will that happen?
I thought well, I could use
benefit in force at the beach 
to get the water out.
Since is coming, guys.
How will you, okay?
No, there is still a little.
Hold on one minute there.
Cliff is a guy who falls fairly well
It's funny, has great charisma
and say that is the best in our tribe falls
right now.
Not born missing that have lifted more.
Just keep it in that position.
I see Cliff and I can not tell you that
basketball team was
or what he did for a living or what
ago now
because in truth I do not care.
Do you say, you
asustasteis?
No, it was not so bad.
And then we have
Lindsey, Sarah Woo 
apparently you like them.
Is as if they were his fans.
Truth I love Cliff.
I think it's fantastic,
I think so.
This is a game.
I know how to play this 
Only I have to make sure
be aware of what is happening 
Our first mission...
failure .
Today is a wonder, a tribe of
wonder 
But there are plenty of people playing
theirs
and here I am.
Alexis is the one flirting
here 
That plan
is always showing her sensuality and her underwear 
And I plan says:
'? Want coconut juice'
So I see what he plays.
Jefra moreover,
not know what's playing.
Meais And you lot?
Be that shit no,
but piss?
Maybe once a day is not good for us
.
All waxes her box
waxes are not shiny.
You look cute in those socks.
Jeremiah only see as a friend 
but can he see me as more
.
So if I see that I need
course I will use it 
So would in my pocket 
'm From Silicon Valley, and it is full
technicians and engineers.
A tribe that Sabiondo
would love where I live.
Jeremiah you drop
drool over Morgan 
And being the final member
I can facilitate work for Morgan and
to be with her.
Do not
puts you in the Jefra nerves?
For me, both me put
nerves.
Just sitting with her smile.
I think we need to be the smart
, those running.
Yes
And if all trust in my...
All three have to be together.
I think when I saw
tribe to me
thought it would be the fourth girl from the tribe.
Doing nothing all day 
Do not judge a book by its cover
.
'm Playing 
Any of these are
medium-dry, Trish?
And what about this?
This will last quite.
If you need firewood can go get more, Lindsey.
There is enough wood up there.
you have a problem?
Seem to have a problem with me.
No, what I mean is that if we have
fire
for the following 39 days
need as much wood as possible.
Okay, and then
why me?
Why pay me?
Well, we all try to help.
Exactly, then
- why not me?
- I'm not sure.
- Are you kidding?
- Leave it, or case.
Trish or Tricia
need to calm down.
Because I can not endure it every time he speaks.
I can not stand his attitude.
Can not stand the fact that I judge both 
Lindsey, I think I can contribute as
does the rest.
Only want you so
I do, that's all I'm saying.
Madremía if
not stand her.
What's up, Trish,
everything okay?
Was just sitting there kissing her ass to Cliff.
Well, listen.
Think we all start
see what I see 
As Lindsey no help at all 
and how irritating it can
unless you are here 
'm from Mass, Boston.
I have not known yet.
If I had gotten two cakes
... would still crying now.
Lindsey is casting by Cliff
their skills to basketball or whatever.
I'm with you,
okay?
I've got you,
and you have me.
I trust Trish 
A real person 
She's there letting the soul
only while the rest are with the dramas .
're Sweet, but
have to be strong.
- I am.
- You have to be.
Do not let those ideas
are you getting into your head
and you say, 'Look this is what happens
'. Because it is not.
'll Do what I have to do and then I'll tell
what I do.
- Okay.
- Talk to you later, okay?
Trish and I are going to lead
feet with these people
And that's why I
the idea of ​​spying 
So I helped with shelter, acted 
as if to help protect people
rain 
But I'm doing a gap to spy 
I'm trying to plug a
corner with a palm leaf 
and I go to the beach
= =
then come here to hear what they say.
And I'll listen to everything.
So anything that tells Cliff Woo
will be crucial information 
Is the key to this 
Not only listen to some, but
hear everything.
That's what I want.
My main goal is Cliff,
lion pack 
So to me with the pack
another lion has to get and
kill the head of the herd.
And then you have to kill their cubs.
I have more intelligence than force, they only

Sarah did it again.

Today we went to

Tony cut in the foot too 
There was blood on the puzzle and
and take it out as the tribe
force we are, why we do .
Blood, sweat and tears to get what we want
.
- Good job to all.
- Well done, man.
We were the best, win fishing equipment
and all that was at stake.
We have olive oil, salt 
It's wonderful,
is all wonderful 
's Good stuff.
The first thing crossed my mind is that
would have
some sort of idol or track
to the idol in the basket.
So I opened the brown pack,
and I saw a piece of paper inside.
So when I looked again the
caught and put in my pocket 
and something of this size.
And this is what he had,
and this is what he had.
'The ocean offers fish, the well provides water
.'
'
Another water body provides protection.'
Protection Y
is what I need right now.
'Tied to something solid,
is the idol you are persecuting.'
'Very hidden, but not very deep.
Y requires you wet '
I love, and I know exactly where that place is
.
We have in the pond behind the camp
There is a huge trunk, which is good solid
I love you.
I love.
Come on, man.
's Here.
Can not be.
Come on, man.
I got into the lake and
after a while I felt a buldo
and knew it was right there
idol, and found it.
This is vital.
I needed.
Not have to tell anyone that I have
,
not going to benefit me in my
anything if I tell someone.
Because that will give them reason to amaze
not want that,
I want to surprise them.
So this idol no one will know your existence.
I'm the king of the jungle,
the king of the jungle.
'm The king of the selvaaaaa!
We returned to camp and since we J'Tia fucked in the challenge,
is clear that she is the clear choice for
leave today 
What do you think guys
to do?
Do we have lots of conversations aside,
or come to a consensus as a group?
Not want to have to use the idol now 
so I decided to try to show his position Kass
front of everyone,
to see who goes.
? Kass,
do you have an opinion?
I think J'TIa.
Did not do much swimming when
threw all of the chests.
And then the puzzle as well...
Had no
good contribution in the challenge or another aspect.
I'm just being honest.
Spencer, what would you think?
If good sense.
Are we having a discussion about
?
- I think we should talk.
- I think we should be honest.
- Yes because -
- need to win.
? Garrett?
Yes, I agree.
? Tasha?
Still think
I want to talk to people individually
because
do not know who is being honest or not.
My vote as well, I do not want to have conversations
apart.
Is what I prefer.
Not think I love Survivor 
and now that I'm here is frustrating
I am with people who do not want to play.
I am ready to cajole, betray,
but it seems that
I am told that it will not be.
Saddens me 
The best thing I think is that the
five're here until the Board reaches.
- Dinner...
- need to talk to you two.
Are the only conversations I need to have separate.
Do not know why I have to have private conversations
.
Everything has been pretty clear.
This is Survivor,
spoken here.
But I do not want more...
is...
Then get out of here!
It's...
This is the least
strategic game that nobody has played.
Not know why you think that
Garrett is the lead in Luzon 
No is the leader of the tribe.
It pulls lying all day
rather like watching others work 
Is always hungry and it turns out that
will not play 
is being...
is foolish.
From Dumberer.
It is.
Survivor That is unless you play this
must be played as well go to take wind.
PIRATE!
I had a conversation with my tribe
and told me: 'Sit down a minute
have been reviewing your history and you have to go home.'
Saying, 'No, no, no,
do not tell you apart, but before all
'
Yes, of course.
As
as my personality as I think it would take me 
I'm not talking just today
but
spoke of the following three days.
In the next three days we will have a great
camp
and we will win the challenge
'll win all challenges one after another
and not have to return to the Council more.
If you can not talk about strategies
.
Like the genius that is
Survivor 
Garret decided to mount a hall discussion
to see what we do at
Council.
Garret, you're an idiot!
What are you doing?
're Number one in idiocy Survivor.
Why would you do that 
? 
Would have been very easy to say what you want to hear J'Tia 
Garret But now let go all
now have to care for these girls
And ensure that they go home.
You have to realize that
can turn around this.
If they do not want to do things I do,
and I will try to change this.
I will not be in the next
go home.
Think,
are only two of them.
In any case I'm the third or fourth and you
the third or fourth.
I have to do what it takes to be
above.
Why can not you send
be?
I make it so.
I'm telling you...
one and two.
Next is go I promise.
Tonight
is the only day we have the numbers.
Kass.
Think.
Hello, girls.
Hey, I do not want to leave
J'Tia alone.
Who knows what God is doing.
- Is pissed.
- Someone has to watch her.
A
know that you will go through your head.
There will be mischief.
Okay, prefer
four to be together.
The last thing I want is
fight, I do not like.
YES so it goes, as it
.
'm Pissed, and I'm
go through the front door 
Treat me like crazy.
's Why I watch,
as a mental patient.
Y
left the mental patient and he was just the clamp.
This is what happens when you let
crazy people alone.
- Do not have any water in bottles?
- Not a drop.
Think.
Is that rice?
Who threw rice into the fire?
- Do not know.
- Do not you know, magic?
Do not know.
- Is there rice on fire?
- Hello?
Is all rice?
We know who did it.
- I threw everything.
- Can not...
I is almost nothing.
J'Tia
was as rare when we went to the beach 
Was a mistake let alone 
Y
threw all our rice and now we have.
've Had bad
here before this 
and this puts me to a new level.
Mira.
Garrett.
All our rice.
Wanted us to be together here!
What was the criteria for selecting Intelligent
?
I like to see.
Because... ironically
Was about to approach J'Tia
to tell to change the vote 
Back to camp and threw all the rice
Fire .
I can not ally with a person
Tribal Council number two.
The faces that you come.
Spencer, what happened?
Well... after challenge decided
We make a living
discussion to see who is going.
Which is something that is not normally done in
Survivor.
Tell me what you spoke, Tasha.
Well basically what we lost by the challenge.
What was the fault of J'Tia what?
Yes, and I suggested:
'Hey Garret and Spencer, I can
we go apart to talk?'
But then what Garret said.
That what has to be done
talk then.
Garret, why discuss it
all so openly?
What is the meaning of that?
Basically wanted to let you know that was going to be her.
So we told
that we would vote for J'Tia
and that would calm Kass.
Jeff, to be honest I'm really pissed
.
Garret I wondered why I had
to make all the decisions.
So I gave a fit
and threw rice into the fire.
Go.
- All rice?
- Almost.
- It became a bit.
- Yes
- pulled as 98%.
- Yes
Well, it was not my best.
That is clear.
Jeff But I want to add that
is why I wanted to talk privately.
She gets angry easily.
And I knew he would do something like that when
hear that.
But you are responsible for telling that he was leaving.
No wonder the expulsions by surprise work.
Not because they're fun, but because they are effective
.
All it takes to have more conversations
Account
is that you put all your time in game.
Never been trying to set up a master plan.
What you did is basically
me up in front of everyone.
Not at all.
- The thing is...
- Whatever.
To be home,
strip most of our rice
accuses me of something I did
front of everyone.
Which is very unfair.
Kass , are you where you are?
Have you heard
the two sides of the story, and Garret J'Tia.
Jeff, both are
very paranoid people.
I was in the water with foot cleansing Tasha
after challenge, and Garret is very paranoid
came with us too and then
was when we ran out of rice.
Is not fair.
- It's the rice is gone.
- It was the fault of one person.
If you are going to speak just before coming to
Council
I do not expect too
I just sit in the shelter.
So what is more important,
? 30 days without rice, and see how we clean our feet
?
- Skies.
- Jeff.
I feel my game is
being embarrassed now.
Del all, how can you play Survivor
if you can not talk with others alone?
Tasha was upset today because
J'Tia was his closest ally.
It's that simple.
You can ask the rest of the alliance.
Okay forgiveness Tribe.
And we want J'Tia go,
and certainly that's pissed.
Kass you smiled when he said 'alliance'
and fixed it saying 'tribe'.
Yes, because
formed no part of the alliance.
Do not you think that you, Spencer and I
you form an alliance on day four?
Come on, if you're out!
- Now I'm out.
- Yes, you.
Go.
Is a flexible girl.
And Garret decides who is in and out.
So if I'm right,
things are right now:
Garret, Kass and Spencer states,
J'Tia and Tasha are in trouble.
And most certainly go J'Tia today.
I do not see it at all.
But is not what you just said?
If J'Tia goes home we have four players
which can form a close-knit team.
Okay, you may not have heard me
well.
- Spencer, am I right?
- For nothing, is what you just said.
But repeating,
I have not developed any master plan.
Kass
approached Spencer and I and told us:
'not going to be able to separate the girls
without me'
y
Spencer and I thought that was right.
knew we were going to do, but when J'Tia
failed us Challenge
decision
what were going to do was clear.
Bringing Kass, Garret just say
you you approached him and Spencer
to separate the girls
and form an alliance,
True or false?
That has Garret said, but that did not happen
things.
So how do you trust Garret?
- I do not trust anyone.
- I stood outside the alliance.
Clearly you will stay with my place.
Not true, he needed to separate you two
Tasha, no more.
The four of us are equal.
What four?
Madremía, this is crazy.
I have no idea
what will happen.
But
has been quite enlightening and moved.
's Time to vote.
Garret, you go first.
The fact that you
nuclear engineer gives very, very afraid.
I'll get the votes.
If anyone has the immunity idol and wants to play
,
now would be the time to do so.
Okay, once
read the decision is final.
The person ejected must leave
Council area immediately.
Read the votes.
First Vote...
J'Tia.
Garret.
A vote J'Tia a Garret vote.
Two votes J'Tia, Garret
one vote.
Garret, draw.
J'Tia Two votes, two votes Garret.
It is one vote.
Second person voted out of Survivor Cagayan:
Garret.
Garret, the tribe has spoken.
's Time for you to leave.
Who wants to welcome me
marginalized group?
Not so bad.
This has been the strangest Council
which I took part.
If you can make something good
tonight Council
is looking
you learned how to play this.
Grab your torches and come back to camp
, which may rest.
Then next episode scenes 
In the next episode of Survivor... 
Tony is looking for an ally 
I have been a cop for about 13 years.
While the rest... 
- just looking...
- is disastrous 
hold 
It's like he was in a state
'nightmare Survivor'.
I have been totally surprised.
Had left
immunity idol at camp 
Neither had raised me 
Because I was pretty sure from
what would happen today 
is very embarrassing,
in many ways 
Very, very embarrassing.
