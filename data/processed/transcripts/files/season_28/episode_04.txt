 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"... THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 AT THE BEAUTY TRIBE, MORGAN
LOST HER ONLY ALLY AND WAS UP
AGAINST AN ALLIANCE OF FOUR.
 THERE'S A HUGE POSSIBILITY
THAT I'M NEXT TO GO.
I GUESS I JUST GOT TO SAVE
MYSELF.
 FOR THE BRAWN TRIBE, WINNING








WAS BECOMING ROUTINE.
BRAWN WINS.
 Jeff: IT COULDN'T STOP
CRACKS FROM FORMING.
 YOU CAN TRUST ME.
 Jeff: AT THE LAST COMMUNITY
CHALLENGE -- SPENCER, IN AND
OUT -- THE BRAIN TRIBE CONTINUED
THEIR TRADITION OF LOSING.
THE BRAIN TRIBE TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL ONCE AGAIN.
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL -- AT THE
RATE YOU'RE GOING, NONE OF YOU
WILL BE THERE AT THE END --








THERE DILEMMA WAS CLEAR.
 DO WE GO WITH OUR STRONG
CHALLENGE MEMBER, SPENCER, OR DO
WE GO WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS
BEEN MORE LOYAL?
 Jeff: IN THE END, THEY
CHOSE STRENGTH.
J'TIA, BRICK ME YOUR TORCH.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
14 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 OUR FIRE IS STILL GOING.
 OH, MY GOD.
 ALL RIGHT.
HUGS TO BOTH OF YOU.
 THAT WAS SO INTENSE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO NERVOUS.
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER RIGHT NOW
TO STILL BE IN THE GAME.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING HOME
TODAY.
THIS GAME CHANGES LIKE THAT.
NOW I'M RISING BACK UP.
IT'S A COMPLETE ROLLER COASTER
RIDE, AND I'M JUST HAPPY THAT I
HAVEN'T FALLEN OFF THE ROLLER
COASTER YET.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL WENT INTO
YOUR DECISION.
I CAN'T... LIKE YOU GUYS ARE
INTENSE, MAKING DECISIONS AT
TRIBAL.
 I JUST KNEW IF WE KEPT HER WE
WOULD BE BACK THERE IN THREE
DAYS AND REGRETTING IT.
I JUST HAD THAT FEELING IN MY
GUT.
 IT'S A CRAZY TRIBAL.
WE HAD LAST-MINUTE TRIBAL VOTE
SWITCH.
IT JUST HIT ME.
WE GUARANTEE A LOSS IF WE KEEP
J'TIA, BUT IF WE GO WITH
SPENCER, HE KICKS BUTT AND I
NEED TO WIN, BUT HOW MY TEAM HAS
PLAYED THIS GAME IS RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE NOTED THE BRAIN TRIBE.
WE'RE THE CRAP-FOR-BRAIN TRIBE,
JUST A ROLLING LOGJAM MESS WITH
A COUPLE NERDS ON TO BE.
 THIS COULD BE THE FINAL
THREE.
THE ONLY THING BETWEEN THAT IS
TWO ENTIRE TRIBES.
 IS THAT IT?
 THAT'S IT.
 NO PROBLEM, MAN.
 WHAT'S UP?
 NOT MUCH.
 READY TO KEEP ON?
 HOW ABOUT WE SEE WHAT TREE
MAIL HAS TO SAY.
 NO!
 YOU'RE CRAVING THE TASTE OF
SWEET VICTORY.
 OH.
 AT LEAST THAT IS HOW IT IS
SEEMING.
TO BE DENIED THIS FLAVOR
SENSATION, YOU'LL BE DRAGGED
AWAY KICKING AND SCREAMING.
 FOOD.
 THE DECISION TO KEEP SPENCER
WILL BE TESTED TODAY.
WE KEEP SAYING, THIS IS THE BEST
COMBINATION OF PEOPLE, THIS IS
THE STRONGEST TRIBE WE HAVE.
WELL, THE RUBBER WILL MEET THE
ROAD TODAY.
 THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO
COME BACK.
 THE START OF THE COMEBACK.
 THE BRAIN TRIBE HAS BEEN
THROUGH SO MUCH, AND IF WE COME
OUT WITH A VICTORY, I THINK
PEOPLE WILL START THINKING AGAIN
ABOUT HOW STRONG THIS BRAIN
TRIBE REALLY IS.
 Bianca: COME ON
 Jeff: COME ON, IN GUYS.
BRAWN AND BEAUTY TRIBE GETTING
YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW BRAIN
TRIBE.
J'TIA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
DROP YOUR BUFFS.
BRAINS, BRAWN AND BEAUTY IS NO
MORE.
 OH, MAN.
 Jeff: BRAIN, BRAWN AND
BEAUTY IS NO MORE.
WE'RE GOING TO FORM TWO NEW
TRIBES.
 JEFF SAYS "DROP YOUR BUFFS"
AND MY HEAD... IT TOOK ME
PROBABLY SIX DAYS TO FIGURE OUT
WHO I CAN TRUST OUT HERE.
NOW I HAVE TO START ALL OVER.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY IS GOING TO
TAKE A COVERED BUFF.
DON'T OPEN IT YET.
TAKE WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT.
WE'RE DRAWING FOR TWO NEW
TRIBES, SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
ORANGE OR PURPLE.
EVERYBODY OPEN YOUR LITTLE
PACKAGE AND SEE WHAT BUFF YOU
HAVE.
BRAIN TRIBE ALL STICKING
TOGETHER.
A LOT OF THE BRAWN TRIBE
STICKING TOGETHER.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS ON YOUR NEW
MATS, GET TO KNOW YOUR NEW
TRIBE.
 ALEXIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO NEW TRIBES.
SPENCER, MORGAN, KASS, TASHA,
JEREMIAH AND ALEXIS.
THE NEW SOLANA TRIBE, CLIFF,
JEFRA, L.J., LINDSAY, TONY.
SO, SARAH, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
OF YOUR TRIBE TO STAY.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS NEW
TRIBE?
 IT FEELS LIKE I'M THE ODD ONE
OUT.
MY ENTIRE TRIBE JUST WALKED AWAY
FROM ME.
 Jeff: TASH, YEAH THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU PRAYED FOR, TO
START OVER.
 IT IS.
I'M SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW LOOKING
AT THIS TRIBE.
I THINK WE WILL BE VERY STRONG
IN CHALLENGES.
I'M SO EXCITED, JEFF.
 Jeff: JEFRA?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: ALMOST THE ENTIRE
BRAWN TRIBE IS TOGETHER EXCEPT
FOR YOU AND L.J.?
 RIGHT.
 THEY DEFINITELY GOT US WITH
NUMBERS, BUT I'M EXCITED TO BE
TEAMED UP WITH THE BRAWN,
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST
AND THE STRONGEST AND MAYBE
THERE WILL BE SOME CRACKS THAT
L.J. AND I CAN FIT IN SOMEWHERE.
 Jeff: CLIFF, WHAT DOES THIS
DO TO THE GAME?
 WELL, IT DEFINITELY SHIFTS
PEOPLE'S THOUGHT PROCESS AND
WHERE THEY WERE WITH THEIR
PARTICULAR ALLIANCE, IF THEY'RE
GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK
THOSE ALLIANCES OR TRY TO CREATE
NEW ONES.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHOULD WE GET TO OUR FIRST
REWARD CHALLENGE AS A NEW TRIBE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, ONE PERSON IS GOING
TO HOLD ON THE A POLE.
ON MY GO, TWO MEMBERS FROM THE
OTHER TRIBE WILL ATTEMPT TO
REMOVE THEM FROM THAT POLE AND
DRAG THEM TO THE FINISH LINE.
THE FIRST TRIBE TO GET THE TRIBE
MEMBER FROM THE OTHER TRIBE
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE SCORES A
POINT.
FIRST TO TWO WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: IT IS BIG.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT.
[ALL REACTING]
COFFEE, DOUGHNUTS, CHOCOLATE
CHIP COOKIE, BLUEBERRY PASTRIES,
CINNAMON ROLL, BROWNIES.
IT IS A GREAT WAY TO CELEBRATE
THE FIRST VICTORY OF THE NEW
TRIBE.
GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
FIRST ROUND, ALL WOMEN,
ATTACKING FOR APARI IS MORGAN
AND SARAH.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO
GET LINDSEY OFF OF THAT POLE AND
OFF THE LINE.
ATTACKING FOR SOLANA, TRISH AND
JEFRA.
THEY'LL BE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE
TASHA.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
TASHA AND LINDSEY DIGGING IN.
JEFRA AND TRISH STARTING ON
TASHA.
SARAH AND MORGAN START IN ON
LINDSEY.
YOU GOT TO GET 'EM FREE OF THAT
POST, AND THEN YOU GOT TO GET
THEM ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE
SAND.
LINDSEY, THEY HAVE HER ARMS
FREE, MORGAN SITTING ON TOP OF
LINDSEY WHILE SARAH WORKS ON HER
LEGS.
TASHA HANGING ON.
TRISH AND JEFRA CANNOT BUDGE
TASHA.
SHE'S GOT A GOOD GRIP.
 KEEP IT UP, TASHA!
 Jeff: SARAH HAS LINDSEY'S
LEG FREE.
MORGAN AND SARAH HAVE LINDSEY
FREE OF THE POST.
NOW THEY HAVE TO GET HER BACK.
LINDSEY GRAKING BACK ON AGAIN.
IT'S GETTING VERY PHYSICAL
BETWEEN LINDSEY, MORGAN AND
SARAH.
TRISH AND JEFRA NOW HAVE BOTH
ARMS OFF THAT POLE FOR TASHA.
MORGAN AND SARAH HAVE LINDSEY
NOW FREE OF THE POST, BUT SHE'S
STILL DIGGING IN THAT SAND.
LINDSEY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT
FOR MORGAN AND SARAH.
IT'S A GREAT FIRST BATTLE.
SARAH AND MORGAN SLOWLY WORKING
LINDSEY TO THAT FINISH LINE, BUT
SHE'S PUTTING UP A BIG, BIG
EFFORT.
LINDSEY BACK ON HER FEET.
AND BACK DOWN AGAIN.
TASHA IS LOCKED IN.
TRISH AND JEFRA CANNOT GET HER
OFF OF THAT POST.
SARAH AND MORGAN GETTING CLOSER
AND CLOSER TO GETTING LINDSEY
ACROSS THAT LINE.
THERE IT IS.
APARI SCORES THE FIRST POINT!
NEXT ROUND, TWO MEN, ONE WOMAN,
ATTACKING FOR APARI IS SPENCER
AND JEREMIAH.
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE
CLIFF FROM THE POST.
ATTACKING FOR SOLANA IS L.J. AND
TRISH HAVING TO RUN AGAIN.
THEY'LL BE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE
ALEXIS FROM HER POST.
APARI LEADS 1-0.
WE'RE PLAYING TO TWO.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
CLIFF IS A BIG FELLA.
GOT A LOT OF WEIGHT AND A LOT OF
HEIGHT AND A LOT OF BODY, BUT
JEREMIAH AND SPENCER ARE GETTING
IN RIGHT AWAY.
ALEXIS COMPLETELY UNMATCHED.
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
L.J. DRAGGING HER.
ALEXIS QUICKLY OFF THE POLE.
SHE'S KICKING BUT SHE'S NOT
GOING TO DO ANY GOOD.
THERE IT IS.
SOLANA SCORES.
WE ARE TIED 1-1.
FINAL ROUND.
TWO MEN, ONE WOMAN, EACH STRIKE
HAS PUT UP THEIR STRONGEST
COMPETITOR.
IT WILL BE CLIFF BACK ON THE
POST FOR SOLANA.
ATTACKING WILL BE SPENCER AND
J.R. MAYA.
ON THE POST FOR APARI SARAH AND
ATTACKING AGAINST SARAH, LINDSAY
AND TONY.
WINNER OF THIS SCORES REWARD.
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THIS IS IT.
TAKE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO HOLD
ON OR THE REMOVE, DEPENDING ON
YOUR ROLE.
LINDSEY HAS BOTH OF SARAH'S ARMS
OFF.
TONY HAS HER LEGS OFF.
SPENCER AND JEREMIAH HAVE
CLIFF'S ARMS OFF.
SPENCER'S TRYING TO GET HIS LEGS
OUT.
THIS TIME SPENCER AND JEREMIAH
MAKING A LITTLE PROGRESS.
CLIFF HAS HIS FEET LOCKED IN.
SARAH FIGHTING HARD AGAINST TONY
AND LINDSEY.
THEY'RE DRAGGING HER BUT SHE'S
MAKING IT TOUGH.
SPENCER IS TRYING TO SEPARATE
THOSE FEET FROM CLIFF.
JEREMIAH IS SITTING ON TOP OF
CLIFF.
TONY NOW LIFTING SARAH,
LITERALLY LIFTING HER.
CLIFF JUST LAYING BACK SAYING,
GO AHEAD.
GIVE IT A SHOT.
SARAH FIGHTING BACK NOW.
SHE'S NOT GIVING UP.
SARAH GIVING SPENCER AND
JEREMIAH A LOT OF TIME ON CLIFF,
AND IT'S WORKING.
SPENCER NOW HAS CLIFF'S LEGS
FREE.
TONY PULLING SARAH AGAIN.
SHE'S LOST BOTH HER SHOES.
VERY CLOSE TO REWARD.
SOLANA COULD WIN IT.
AND THEY DO.
SOLANA WINS REWARD!
HUGE PHYSICAL EFFORT BY
EVERYBODY.
SOLANA, CONGRATULATION, GRAB
YOUR REWARD, HEAD BACK TO CAMP
AND ENJOY IT.
ALL RIGHT.
APARI, HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 IT'S NICE TO UPGRADE FROM THE
MOMS TO THE HOT GIRLS, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, IT'S TOUGH TO
KEEP LOSING.
EVERYTHING WITH THE BRAINS SEEMS
TO GO WRONG SOMEHOW SOME WAY.
 GOOD JOB ON THAT FIRST
REWARD, GUYS.
 YEAH.
 WE WON A CHALLENGE.
GOOD NEWS.
THE REALITY IS IT'S BAD NEWS.
JEFF AND I ARE OUTNUMBERED 5-2
BY THE BRAWN TRIBE.
I DO HAVE AN IDOL I COULD PLAY,
BUT THAT WOULD ONLY BUY ME A FEW
MORE DAYS AND THEN I'M GONE, SO
MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT THEY ABSORB
ME AS A TEAM MEMBER AS OPPOSED
TO A THREAT.
 WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT ALL YOU ALL DO.
 WHAT DID YOU GUESS?
 ARE YOU A HAIRDRESSER?
THE SCISSORS.
 YOU'VE GOT TO BE A SURFER.
 I'M MARTIAL AWTS TRAINER.
 WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
 FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE FROM
MONTANA OR COLORADO.
 I FIND OUT L.J. WAS FROM
MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH I NEVER
WOULD HAVE GUESSED, AND I AM,
TOO.
THAT BRINGS US A CONNECTION.
YOU WENT TO SAUGUS HIGH?
WHAT YEAR DID YOU GRADUATE?
 '97.
 I THOUGHT THE BEAUTY TRIBE
LOOKED HIGH MAINTENANCE.
L.J. IS LAID BACK.
YOU CAN TELL HE'S A GENTLEMAN.
HE'S A BOSTON BOY.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I THOUGHT
HE'S A NICE BOY.
 I WAS LIKE,ER WANTED TO GET A
HORSE.
 I THINK L.J.'S A REALLY
HANDSOME GUY, BUT I COULD BE HIS
MOTHER.
I'M NOT MRS. ROBINSON.
 WHEN TRISH SAID SHE WAS FROM
BOSTON, IT WAS A MOMENT OF
BEAMING SUNSHINE FOR ME.
WE ALREADY HAVE A CONNECTION,
AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON I'M A
DRAW TO SOMEBODY A LITTLE BIT
OLDER THAT'S SINGLE AND, YOU
KNOW, BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF
STUFF, WHETHER IT'S THE SEX
APPEAL OR WHATEVER THAT SHE'S
DRAWN TO, I'M GOING TO USE IT TO
SAVE MYSELF.
 I HAVE TO GET OUT MORE,
WHAT'S TWERKING.
 I'D LIKE TO SEE TRISH TWERK.
 NO ONE WANTS TO SEE TRISH
TWERK, TRUST ME.
 TRISH IS TOTALLY EXAGGERATES
HER LAUGH AROUND GUYS AND IT
MAKES ME SICK.
LIKE YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD, STOP
TRYING TO GET ATTENTION FROM
20-YEAR-OLD MEN.
SERIOUSLY.
 WHEN I SAW PURPLE, PURPLE, I
WAS LIKE, OH, COME ON.
 OH, WOW.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
WERE MIXED UP TODAY.
I WAS ABLE TO KEEP FIVE OF MY
ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF MY TRIBE.
WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING ON WITH
THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE, WE'RE
IN A GREAT POSITION.
THE ONE THING I HATE IS TRISH.
MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS TRISH.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HER AND L.J.
I JUST HAVE TO REALLY KEEP AN
EYE ON THE TWO OF THEM.
IT'S A MUST.
 HIGH-FIVE.
 THANKS, BUDDY.
 IF I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO
HAVE GUST, WE WOULD HAVE CLEANED
UP A LITTLE.
YOU'RE NOT THE GUESTS.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
 I'M THE ONLY ORIGINAL APARRI
MEMBER ON A TRIBE WITH THREE
BRAINS AND THREE BEAUTIES.
IT'S DEFINITELY A SCARY POSITION
TO BE IN BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU CAN TRUST AND WHO YOU
CAN'T TRUST.
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO ASK ON
DAY ONE WHO TOOK THE FOOD OR DID
THEY TAKE THE RICE.
 WE HAVE TWO BAGS OF RICE HERE
TRISH DIDN'T GO FOR THE IDOL.
SHE WENT FOR THE RICE.
 GARRETT WENT FOR THE IDOL?
 HE DIDN'T TELL US WHAT
HAPPENED.
WE WERE GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT.
 WHAT WAS THE DECISION?
 TAKE RICE OR IDOL?
 SARAH OUTED ME WHEN SHE SAID
TRISH PICKED RICE INSTEAD OF THE
IDOL BECAUSE I CHOSE THE CLUE
AND I KEPT IT A SECRET THE
ENTIRE TIME, SO HOPEFULLY I KIND
OF START FRESH WITH THIS TRIBE
AND NO ONE HOLDS IT AGAINST ME.
I WENT FOR THE CLUE FOR THE
IDOL, BUT OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE
IT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 MORGAN LIED DAY ONE, AND IT
PUT A BIGGER RIFF, NOT THAT SHE
DOESN'T HAVE 100 RED FLAGS
ALREADY.
IT TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
TO KNOW, WHICH IS TO NOT TRUST
HER AND NEVER ALLY WITH HER, SO
I'M GOING TO PROTECT MYSELF AND
JUMP SHIP RIGHT AWAY.
 I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO
YOU GUYS.
MY CLOSEST FRIEND ON MY TRIBE
WAS JEFRA, AND SHE'S NOT WITH ME
ANYMORE, SO I THINK THE ONLY
SCENARIO IS THE SAFEST IS IF THE
FOUR OF US STICK TOGETHER.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TRUST
SOMEONE RIGHT AWAY, BUT IF I
GIVE YOU MY WORD, I MEAN IT.
 I THINK IT'S REALLY TELLING
HOW FAST AND HOW ALMOST
DESPERATELY REXIS CAME UP TO US.
NOW THAT WE SEE BEAUTY IS
FRACTURING A LITTLE BIT, IT PUTS
THE BRAIN IN A MUCH BETTER
POSITION.
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THIS
DIVIDED SHOWS THAT WE CAN PLAY
THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 ORIGINALLY JEREMIAH WAS WITH
US AND HE FLIPPED AND THEN
FLIPPED BACK AND MORGAN LIES ALL
THE TIME.
THE ENTIRE GAME HE'S NEVER GONE
TO THE WATER WELL.
I THINK...
 THE BEAUTY TRIBE IS A VERY
GOSSIPY TRIBE.
THEY'RE ALMOST HIKE HIGH
SCHOOLERS.
THEY TALK BAD ABOUT EACH OTHER,
SPREAD RUMORS.
SOMETIMES RIGHT IN FRONT OF EACH
OTHER.
 L.J. AND HER LIKE CUDDLE
TOGETHER EVERY NIGHT AND HE'LL
ALWAYS ASK HER TO SHAKE HER
BUTT.
 BOOTY SHAKING.
 YEAH.
SHE PRIDES HERSELF ON BEING ABLE
TO TWERK REALLY WELL.
 THEY JUST SEEM TO HAVE SO
LITTLE SOCIAL SKILLS FOR A TRIBE
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL
AND SOCIAL.
 RIGHT NOW MY GUESS IS MORGAN
WOULD BACKSTAB ME IN A
HEARTBEAT.
 ARE YOUR FRIENDS WITH ALEXIS.
 WE WERE WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED.
AND HER AND L.J. WERE LIKE THIS.
SO I'M ON THE OUTS, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?
I'LL GO WITH YOU ALL.
I'LL BE A FOURSOME.
 AS OF NOW THE BRAIN TRIBE IS
IN THE BEST POSITION POSSIBLE.
INITIALLY I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO HAVE TO BATTLE WITH THE
BEAUTIES, BUT THERE'S SOME
DISSENSION AMONGST THE BEAUTY
RANKS.
SO WE WENT FROM TRAGEDY TO WHAT
SEEMS TO BE A TRIUMPH.
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE OUT
OF THE GAME, THINGS SWITCH UP
AND YOU'RE BACK ON TOP.
 THE NIGHT OF THAT HUGE STORM,
DID YOU ALL GET COLD?
IT WAS FREEZING, RIGHT?
 I COULDN'T FEEL MY HANDS.
 ME NEITHER.
I COULD NOT FEEL MY TOES FOR
LIKE THREE HOURS.
I WAS FEELING SO GREAT BEFORE
THE SWITCH.
I WAS FEELING SOLID.
BUT WHEN IT'S JUST L.J. AND I
WITH ALL THE BRAWN TRIBE
BASICALLY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FEELING.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 L.J. AND I ARE NOT...
 YOU'LL PICK UP ON THAT.
SHE'LL COME ACROSS AS A REALLY
HARD WORKER.
BUT SHE'S NOT.
 WHEN TRISH WAS TELLING ME ALL
THE ALLIANCES AND WHERE SHE
STOOD, IT WAS A LITTLE SHOCKING
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED PRETTY FAST,
SO I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT MY
CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH, BUT
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A SPOT
FOR L.J. AND I TO SQUEEZE IN.
 WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET RID
OF CLIFF, BUT HE CAN'T LOSE THE
CHALLENGES.
 L.J. SAID YOU WERE REAL
TIGHT.
 I STARTED THIS GAME BEING
VERY NAIVE, BUT I'M STARTING TO
REALIZE THAT I HAVE TO START
DOING WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET
TO THE TOP.
 GOOD.
 WE'RE GOOD.
 FROM DAY ONE I FELT LIKE I
WAS THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.
THIS TWISTS THE WHOLE THING
RIGHT UPSIDE DOWN.
 HEY, BIG MAN.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
FIRST THING FIRST, I'LL TAKE
BACK THE IDOL.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD WE'RE
ONLY PLAYING FOR ONE IMMUNITY
IDOLMENT WE'LL GET RID OF THE
SMALL LITTLE BROTHER.
WE'LL KEEP MAMA, OR DADDY, I'M
NOT REALLY SURE.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, EACH
TRIBE WILL USE ONE LARGE LOG TO
SMASH THROUGH TWO WALLS.
YOU'LL THEN MANEUVER THE LOG
THROUGH A TABLE.
THE FIRST TRIBE TO GET THEIR LOG
THROUGH THE MAZE AND BANG THE
GONG WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
THE VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR"
CAGAYAN.
THIS CHALLENGE RUNS SIX ON SIX,
WHICH MEANS EACH TRIBE WILL SIT
ONE PERSON OUT.
 I'M GOING TO SIT OUT.
TRISH WILL SIT OUT FOR SOLANA.
 ARE YOU GUYS GOOD AT PUZZLES.
 I REALLY WANT THE PLAY IT.
 ROCK, PAPER SCISSORS.
 ALL RIGHT.
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS SHOOT.
 Jeff: ROCK BREAKS SCISSORS.
MORGAN TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
ALEXIS WILL PARTICIPATE.
GIVE EVERYONE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
ALL SIX PEOPLE HAVE TO STAY WITH
THE LOG AT ALL TIMES.
NECK AND NECK OUT OF THE GATE.
WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT LOG TO
SMASH THROUGH THAT WALL.
SOLANA HITS A DEAD END.
APARRI, IT'S HARDER THAN IT
LOOKS, ISN'T IT?
TOUGHER THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BEMENT YOU GOT TO GET
THAT LOG UP HIGH TO BREAK
THROUGH THOSE 2X4s.
SOLANA DOING A LITTLE DAMAGE.
THERE YOU GO.
APARRI STILL WORKING.
BUT THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE JUST
HOLDING THAT LOG UP.
YOU CAN KICK THROUGH AS LONG AS
YOU STAY HOLDING ON TO THAT LOG.
SOLANA EASING THEIR WAY THROUGH.
 CAN WE SWITCH PLACES?
 YES, YOU CAN SWITCH PLACES.
 GUYS UP FRONT.
 Jeff: APARRI GOING TO
CHANGE THEIR STRATEGY AND PUT
THE BIG GUYS UP FRONT.
SOLANA THROUGH THE FIRST WALL.
APARRI STILL WORKING ON THAT
FIRST WALL.
GOT TO GET THROUGH THE 2X4s.
SOLANA WORKING ON THAT SECOND
WALL.
TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT.
THE LOGS ARE HEAVY.
THE WALLS ARE VERY STRONG.
SARAH'S THROUGH.
APARRI NOW MOVING ON TO THE
SECOND WALL.
APARRI NOW IS BACK IN THIS.
SOLANA'S LOST SOME OF THEIR
MOMENTUM.
APARRI NOW CHANGING THEIR
STRATEGY WITH JEREMIAH AND
SPENCER AND IT'S WORKING.
 GO!
 Jeff: APARRI IS STARTING TO
SLIDE THROUGH.
SOLANA NOW GETTING THROUGH.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK.
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE
MAZE.
 GO, GO, GO!
 COME ON, COME ON.
 Jeff: ONCE YOU GET THE
WEIGHT OFF THIS LOG, STRIP OFF
THOSE HANDLES AND START WORKING
ON THE MAZE.
SOLANA'S STARTED ON THEIR MAZE.
APARRI NOW WORKING ON THEIR
MAZE.
 PUSH.
 LEFT.
RIGHT.
 Jeff: SOLANA WITH A BIT OF
A LEAD, BUT APARRI IS RIGHT
BEHIND THEM.
 BACK, BACK, BACK.
 Jeff: SOLANA MAKES A BIG
MISTAKE.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO
BACK.
 BACK, BACK.
 Jeff: APARRI MAKES THE SAME
MISTAKE.
THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.
A LOT OF WORKING TOGETHER.
COMMUNICATION IS KEY.
SOLANA HAS THEIR NOSE THROUGH.
APARRI HAS THEIR NOSE THROUGH.
QUESTION IS, ARE YOU RIGHT?
THIS SHOULD BE WHERE THE BRAIN
TRIBE, ALL OF WHICH ARE ON
APARRI, DOES WELL.
SPENCER, TASH AND KASS DO NOT
WANT TO GO BACK THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
NOBODY FROM THE BRAWN TRIBE HAS
EVER BEEN TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 PUSH!
PUSH!
 Jeff: APARRI VERY CLOSE.
SOLANA NOW VERY CLOSE.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK AGAIN.
 GO!
 PUSH!
 Jeff: APARRI HAS IT
THROUGH.
HUGE VICTORY FOR THE UNDERDOGS.
APARRI WINS IMMUNITY!
 OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!
 THAT WAS AWESOME.
 WE COMMUNICATED AND WE KILLED
IT!
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 Jeff: APARRI, WHO WANTS IT?
 TASH.
 Jeff: IMMUNITY FOR APARRI,
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHICH IS A
HUGE CHANGE OF PACE FOR TASH,
KASS AND SPENCERMENT GRAB YOUR
STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP AND
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
ALL RIGHT, SOLANA, WE'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
CAGAYAN."
 HOW COULD WE LOSE THIS
CHALLENGE?
IT WAS CUSTOM MADE FOR BRAWN.
WE'VE GOT THE NUMBERS.
LET'S STRIKE NOW.
L.J.'S A THREAT, SO HE'S GOING
HOME FIRST.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED, MAN.
ALL I KNOW, I WAS SPENT AT THE
END OF THAT.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE
HAVE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT BECAUSE
THEY BEAT US.
 I HATE LOSE SOG MUCH.
 WE WENT INTO THIS CHALLENGE
THINKING NO PROBLEM.
BRUTE FORCE.
AND THERE'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE WON THAT
CHALLENGE.
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T, AND
IT PUTS JEFRA AND I IN A TOUGH
SPOT.
MOST LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
TO GET ME TO GO HOME, SO UNLESS
SOMETHING HAPPENS, I'M SCREWED.
 I GET IT'S A GAME.
 AT THIS POINT WE CAN KEEP
L.J. FOR CHALLENGES, BUT HE'S
FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
TRISH IS FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
THEY HAVE THAT BOND IN COMMON,
AND THEY'VE BEEN OFF ON THEIR
OWN AND HAD CONVERSATIONS, SO
SHE'S OUT HERE PLAYING WITH HER
EMOTIONS.
AND IF YOU GET YOUR FEELINGS
CAUGHT UP IN THIS GAME, THAT'S
WHEN FOOLISH THINGS HAPPEN.
 WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR L.J.
 HELL YEAH.
I'M JUST AS GOOD MAYBE EVEN
BETTER THAN HE IS AND TEN TIMES
BETTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS,
SO GET RID OF THE STRONG.
 I AGREE WITH THAT.
 THE FORMER BRAWN TEAMMATE,
WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION.
BACK AT THE OLD CAMP, WE HAD,
YOU KNOW, SOME TENSION, SOME
ISSUES HERE AND THERE, BUT NOW
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME, AND
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER
PICTURE, AND WHAT'S BEST FOR
SUSS TO GET RID OF L.J.
UNFORTUNATELY THE PARANOIA IS
RAMPANT RIGHT NOW.
 WHAT ABOUT TRISH IN.
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT TRISH?
SHE'S THAT TYPE OF PERSON.
SHE ENJOYS COMPLIMENTING.
DON'T BE THREATENED BY THAT.
 THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ME.
 THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
 IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT, YOU'RE
IN IT?
 TOTALLY.
 MY NAME'S GOING UP THERE.
 OKAY.
THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO KNOW.
 I TALKED TO TRISH AND SHE
SAID THAT SHE WANTS TO GET RID
OF CLIFF.
AND I WAS SHOCKED.
APPARENTLY TRISH AND TONY DON'T
LIKE CLIFF, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE TO ME.
YOU'RE 5-2, YOU DON'T NEED TO
TALK ANYTHING.
SO IF WHAT SHE SAYS IS TRUE, I
MIGHT NOT HAVE TO PLAY MY IDOL.
 THAT'S THE PLAN.
 I HOPE SO, TRISH.
 YOU TRUST ME?
 I DO.
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
 OKAY.
 I PLAY WITH MY HEART.
AND I REALLY LIKE L.J.
HE'S A GENTLEMAN.
HE GETS ALONG WITH PEOPLE.
HE NEVER GIVES UP.
THE GUY'S GOT IT ALL, BUT CLIFF,
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
AND IN 14 DAYS OF HIS
ENTITLEMENT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS
MY NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN HANDLE, SO
WE'RE PUTTING CLIFF'S NAME DOWN,
AND THE BEST PART IS CLIFF
DOESN'T HAVE ONE SINGLE CLUE.
IT'S REALLY CRACKING ME UP.
 SHE'S GOING TO FLIP ON US.
 SHE WON'T FLIP.
 SHE'S GOING TO FLIP.
I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING I LOVE
SHE'S GOING TO SCREW US OVER, I
GUARANTEE IT.
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
 CLIFF DOES NOTHING.
HE NEVER EVEN COLLECTED A PIECE
OF FIREWOOD, SO AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED, CLIFF'S FIRST TO GO.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN 13 DAYS THAT
MAN HAS NOT SAID ONE WORD TO ME,
AND LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, WHEN
WE GET TO THE MASTERING WE HAVE
TO GET RID OF CLIFF ANYWAY.
HE'S STRONG.
HE'LL KILL EVERYBODY IN ALL THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES JUST ON HIS
STRENGTH ALONE.
HE'S GOT TO GO.
HE IS FIRST TO GO.
AND THEN...
 TRISH PULLED ME ASIDE AND
SAID SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF
CLIFF.
WE NEED TO CUT THE HEAD OFF THE
SNAKE, WHICH IS CRAZY.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S BIPOLAR OR
SKITSO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE
IS, BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO DO
THIS.
WE NEED TO GET RID OF L.J.
HE HAS THE HEART, HE HAS THE
DRIVE, HE HAS THE AMBITION, THE
STRATEGIC MIND, SO HE'S
DANGEROUS.
 TRUST ME.
 I TRUST YOU, BUT JEFRA AND
L.J. ARE ON THE BOTTOM.
WE'RE FIVE DEEP.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THEY COULD WIPE US OUT ONE BY
ONE.
 YOU THINK JEFRA AND L.J. ARE
STRONG?
 I DON'T THINK SO, BUT MAYBE
THE JOKE IS ON US.
 THERE'S NO JOKE ON US.
 HERE'S THE DEAL.
I DON'T LIKE CLIFF.
I DIDN'T TRUST HIM FROM THE
BEGINNING.
CLIFF IS A VERY INFLUENTIAL
PERSON, AND HE WRAPS PEOPLE
AROUND HIS FINGER, WHICH MAKES
HIM VERY DANGEROUS PERSON.
BUT IF WE GET RID OF CLIFF, I'M
PUTTING ALL MY CARDS ON L.J.
DO I TRUST HIM?
HELL NO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO.
 WHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION?
 I JUST TOLD THEM ACT BEING
STRONG, THIS AND THAT, AND SHE
SAYS, I HOPE EVERYTHING STAYS
SOLID.
 YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME NO...
YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ME NO...
 THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID, THE
DYNAMIC HAS CHANGED.
SHE SAID, I KNOW THE DYNAMIC IS
CHANGED.
 LISTEN, TRISH CAN MAKE A MOVE
IF SHE WANTS TO.
 NOT BY HERSELF SHE CAN'T.
 EXACTLY.
IF TRISH WANTS TO MAKE A MOVE,
TRISH WILL GET VOTED RIGHT OUT
OF HERE.
WE NEED STABILITY.
SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS, AND
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S
STILL FOUR AGAINST THREE.
 I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S ONLY
SPECULATION, BUT WHO IS GOING?
 L.J. IS GOING.
L.J.
 OKAY.
 I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
TRISH REALLY GOT CAUGHT UP ON
HER EMOTIONS AND SO WE'RE GOING
TO CHOP DOWN TRISH'S NEW SUPPORT
SYSTEM, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
HER COME GROVELING BACK TO HER
OLD TRIBE MATES.
 WE HAVE NOBODY ELSE.
 I'M NERVOUS ABOUT TONY.
 TRISH IS WILLING TO FLIP.
THE THING, IS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
TONY.
THE REALITY IS I DON'T HAVE A
CHOICE, SO I'M PUTTING A
BOATLOAD OF TRUST INTO TRISH AND
TONY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO
DELIVER TONIGHT, AND WHEN THEY
START TO SPILL THEIR GUTS, I
WILL KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE
PLAYING A GAME TO GET ME OUT AND
THEN I'M PLAYING MY IDOL IF I
NEED TO.
 Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
DON'T HAVE A TORCH, GO AHEAD AND
GRAB ONE AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.
SO L.J., AFTER THE TRIBE SWITCH,
YOU GO BACK THE YOUR CAMP, BUT
YOU GO BACK WITH ONLY TWO
MEMBERS AND FIVE PEOPLE FROM THE
OTHER TRIBE.
WHO IS REALLY NOW IN CHARGE OF
THIS CAMP?
 YOU KNOW, I FELL LIKE JEFRA
AND I WERE A LITTLE COUPLE THAT
WERE SELLING OUR HOME AND WE
HAVE THE GROUP THAT IS GOING TO
NOW BUY THE HOME, AND WHENEVER
YOU FEEL LIKE LEAVING, YOU JUST
LET US KNOW, AND WE'LL BE ONER
WAY.
IT WAS VERY INTIMIDATING.
IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S ME
AND JEFRA JUST TRYING TO
ENTERTAIN AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

 Jeff: CLIFF, YOU WALK UP TO
YOUR NEW HOME.
YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS.
IS LIFE REALLY THAT DIFFERENT?
 YOU THINK IT WOULD BE JUST
THAT SIMPLE THAT YOU KEEP MOVING
FORWARD WITH THE NUMBERS, BUT
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT
PERSON WHO DOESN'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE THEY'RE
AT, WHO CAN'T PUT THEIR EMOTIONS
ASIDE.
AND PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THIS GAME IS ABOUT NUMBERS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS.
 SO YUNG, SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
IN THIS GROUP OF FIVE MAY DO
SOMETHING FOOLISH AND PLAY WITH
EMOTION.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE READING INTO
IT IN.
 YEAH, I HEAR CLIFF ALL THE
WAY.
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET
THE WEST OF YOU, MEANING YOU
HAVE TO TRUST WHAT YOU'RE A PART
OF, YOU HAVE TO STICK WITH IT
AND GOING AGAINST THAT, IT'S
ONLY GOING TO PUT YOU IN A BAD
SITUATION.
 TRISH, IS TONIGHT'S TRIBAL A
TEST OF LOYALTY FOR THE FIVE
THAT WERE FORMALLY THE BRAWN
TRIBE?
 I WOULD SAY, SO YES,
ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THAT NUMBERS ARE
IMPORTANT, BUT NUMBERS ARE ONLY
IMPORTANT IF THEY'RE ALSO GOING
TO WORK FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW, IF NOT, THEN MAYBE
THEY HAVE TO MAKE OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOURSELF.
 JEFRA, THIS IS THE ONLY
POSSIBLE NEWS YOU COULD WANT TO
HEAR IF YOU WERE YOU OR L.J.
THAT THERE'S A CHANCE, MAYBE A
LONG SHOT, BUT MAYBE THERE'S A
CRACK OVER THERE.
 YEAH, AND I GET THE
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING NUMBERS ON
YOUR SIDE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
THIS A GAME ALL ABOUT RISK, AND
SOMEBODY'S THE BOTTOM MAN IN
THAT TRIBE, AND THAT BOTTOM MAN
IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE
TOP ON THEIR OWN.
 LINDSEY, THE DANGEROUS THING
FOR YOU IS THAT L.J. AND JEFRA
HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
 RIGHT.
I MEAN, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT
YEAH, I THINK WE ALL SHOULD
STICK TOGETHER.
I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
BECAUSE IT'S NOT 5-2.
IT'S GOING TO BE THE FIVE OF US
AND THEN THE OTHER TRIBE
EVENTUALLY TOGETHER.
NOT INCLUDING JEFRA AND L.J.
 CLIFF, IS THERE SOMETHING
CATHARTIC ABOUT FINALLY GETTING
TO COME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 I LOOK AT IT LIKE AN NBA
PLAYOFF GAME.
THE SERIES DOESN'T REALLY START
UNTIL YOU LOSE A GAME.
AND FOR OLD APARRI, WE HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE.
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW ONE
ANOTHER COULD BE TRULY THINKING.
SO NOW ONCE YOU SEE IT, YOU CAN
MAKE A R ADJUSTMENTS AND KEEP
MOVING FORWARD.
 ARE YOU CONCERNED, TONY, THAT
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COULD SHIFT THE
GAME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?
 TONIGHT'S TRIBAL WILL
DEFINITELY SHIFT THE GAME ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER.
AFTER TONIGHT'S VOTE WE'LL SEE
IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD
AS A TEAM OR WE'RE GOING TO STEP
BACKWARDS OR MOVE FORWARD WITH A
DIFFERENT TEAM.
IT ALL DEPENDS HOW TO VOTE GOES
DOWN.
 ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
YOU'RE UP.
 SORRY, BUDDY, THE LAST THING
YOU NEED IS TO RECONNECT WITH
YOUR BEAUTY TRIBE.
 CLIFF, YOU CAN'T CALL THE
SHOTS FOREVER.
I'M HOPING NOT EVERYBODY ELSE
STICKS WITH THE PLAN.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO Ao,
ALL RIGHT.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE L.J.
CLIFF.
L.J.
CLIFF.
WE'RE TIED.
TWO VOTES CLIFF, TWO VOTES L.J.
THAT'S THREE VOTES L.J.
TWO VOTES CLIFF.
CLIFF.
WE'RE TIED.
THREE VOTES CLIFF, THREE VOTES
L.J., ONE VOTE LEFT.
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: CAGAYAN," CLIFF.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
CLIFF, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
 Jeff: WELL, YOU CAME INTO
TRIBAL COUNCIL WITH ONE BIG
QUESTION: WHERE DOES THE LOYALTY
LIE WITHIN THIS GROUP.
I THINK YOU GOT YOUR ANSWER.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK THE
CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

 NEXT TIME ON "SURVIVOR"...
 TRISH MAKES ME SICK.
 HE DOESN'T HELP OUT AT ALL.
 A FEUD HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR
DAYS.
 I CANNOT STAND HER.
 Jeff: IT CAN NO LONGER BE
CONTAINED.
 EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU I CANNOT
STAND.
 LET ME MAKE THIS REALLY CLEAR
TO YOU: I DON'T LIKE YOU.
 SHE IS A BULLY.
I CANNOT BE AROUND HER.
 Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON?
 I GOT TOO COMFORTABLE WITH MY
CORE ALLIANCE.
I THOUGHT I WAS STAYING UP ON
WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND CAMP,
BUT IT'S TOUGH, IT'S TOUGH.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW WHEN YOU
THINK THINGS ARE GOING THE WAY
YOU EXPECT THEM TO GO, BOOM, YOU
GET BLIND SIDED.
