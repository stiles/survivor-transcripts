         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": NINTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR
JURY, L.J. WHEN TONY BLINDSIDED
L.J., HE ALSO BLINDSIDED HIS OWN
ALLIANCE.
 FEEL LIKE ON THE BOTTOM.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
ANYBODY'S GOAL GOET.
YOU'RE A FREE VOTE NOW.
 AFTER BETRAYING HIS ALLIANCE,








TONY NEEDED A BACKIP PLAN.
 MY GOD!
 Jeff: AND HE FOUND ONE IN
THE FORM OF AN IDOL DIFFERENT
POWERS.
 AFTER YOU SEE THE VOTE YOU
CAN USE IT?
EVERYBODY'S EYES WILL BE BING!
 Jeff: BUT JEFRA HAD A PLAN
OF HER OWN.
 THEY PULLED A BIG MOVE AND I
WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT.
 Jeff: TO ALIGN WITH THE
MINORITY ALLIANCE AND TAKE OUT








TONY.
 FINAL FOUR?
 FINAL FOUR.
 BACK AT CAMP, TONED ATTEMPTED
TO REGAIN THE TRUST OF HIS
ALLIANCE.
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL--
 YOU CAN STEEL STAEL AS MANY
CLUES AS YOU WANT, WOO, I HAVE
THE REAL THING.
 Jeff: SPENCER PLAYED HIS
IDOL, JEFRA GOT COLD FEET, AND
THE ALLIANCE OF FIVE STAYED
TOGETHER JEREMIAH YOU NEED TO
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
LEAVING SPENCER AND TASHA ON THE
BOTTOM ONCE AGAIN.
JEREMIAH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK.
 SEE YOU.
 Jeff: SEVEN ARE LEFT, WHO
WILL BE VOTE OUT TONIGHT.
 BEFORE TRIBAL, I THOUGHT
TESTIFY A GOOD IDEA TO SWITCH
OVER AND JOIN JEREMIAH, TASHA,
AND SPENCER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
WANTING TO TURN ON TONY, BUT I'M
IN THIS ALLIANCE, AND I'M TRYING
TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE,
AND I FELT LIKE IT WOULD
PROBABLY PURT ME WORSE TO GO
AGAINST TAWIVE OR SPENTER AT THE
END OF THIS GAME.
 I FOUND IT THE SAME DAY WOO
STOLE THE CLUE.
 I KNEW YOU HAD IT BY HOW YOU
WERE ACTING.
YOU'RE USUALLY MUCH MEANER TO
ME.
 OH, OKAY.
 I HAD THIS FEELING I THAT
SPENCER HAD THE IDOL AND LIKE A
TYPICAL 20-YEAR-OLD MALE HE WAS
NOT GOING TO GIVE THAT THING UP.
WHAT IS THE MOST SELFIB BEAST ON
THE PLANET?
A COLLEGE-AGED MALE.
 WE WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU
AND WE WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW
WHAT--
 HE'S TOO CALM.
HE'S NOT HOW HE IS.
I'VE SEEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'RE GETTING VOTED OUT TOO
MANY TIMESES.
 I'M IMPRESSED THAT THAT'S
ACTUALLY TRUE.
I USED THE IDOL, AND I USED IT
WRONG.
SO NOW MY IDOL'S GONE.
MY MAIN ALLIANCE IS GONE, AND
TASHA AND I ARE AN ARMY OF TWO
UP AGAINST THIS GOLIATH ARMY OF
FIVE.
BUT THE FACT IS THAT TASHA AND I
ARE STILL HERE.
TONIGHT WE LOST THE BATTLE.
WE HAVE NOT LOST THE WAR.
 I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES
TOGETHER.
 THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.
 TREE MAIL.
 WHOOO!
 CONGRATULATIONS, CELEBRATE
WITH A FEAST.
 AH!
 WHAT IS IT?
 AH, TRISH, WILL YOU LIFT UP
MY SHIRT REAL QUICK?
WHEN THEY CAME WITH THE TREE
MAIL WOO SAID MY BACK IS REALLY
BOTHERING ME AND I SAID OH, MY
GOSH, ARE YOU OKAY?
AND I ALMOST WET MY PANT WHEN I
SAW THE WALLETS OF MONEY AND I
KNEW IT WAS THE AUCTION AND I
WAS REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE I
KNEW I WOULD GET SOMETHING TO
EAT.
AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED WAS
SOMETHING TO EAT BESIDES RICE.
 YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE AND NOW
YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN IT.
IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN
CRAVING YOU BETTER BE QUICK TO
WIN IT.
 FOOD!
 PIZZA!
BURGERS!
 HISTORICALLY, IN THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR," EVERY TIME THERE'S
AN AUCTION, THERE'S ALWAYS SOME
KIND OF ADVANTAGE TO A
CHALLENGE.
THE SECOND I HEAR JEFF SAY, "A
BET--" $500.
I WANT THAT ADVANTAGE, AND I
DON'T WANT SPENCER OR TASH TO
HAVE IT.
 AWESOME.
 CHEERS TO THE AUCTION.
 CHEERS!
 RIGHT NOW, IT'S ME OR TASHA
GOING HOME SO ME AND TASHA HAVE
TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN THIS AUCTION
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR LIFE RIGHT
NOW.

 Jeff: STEAK SANDWICH AND

 I WOULD HAVE DEVOURED THAT

MY STOMACH IS STARTING TO TIE UP
IN KNOTS.
-- I-- I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD
HOLD OUT ON THE TEMPTATION.
 SO GOOD.
 Jeff: TAKE IT BACK.
 LOOK AT THAT.
 I FELT SHAKY.
I FELT LIGHT-HEADED.
AND I JUST HAD TO HOLD OFF.
I WASN'T WALKING OUT THEREOF
WITHOUT AN ADVANTAGE.
 I WISH I COULD SHARE.
CAN I SHARE IT?
 Jeff: IT'S SO GOOD YOU
CAN'T.
THAT WAY YOU CAN SAY YOU WANT
TO.
ALL RIGHT, KASS DIDN'T WANT THIS

MIGHT AS WELL PUT THIS ONE UP
FOR BID.

MAYBE THE BIGGEST BARGAIN EVER
AT A "SURVIVOR" AUCTION.
 GOOD JOB, WOO.
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE
ACTUALLY VYING FOR THE FOOD,
THIS AUCTION WAS A BUYERS'
MARKET.
GREAT DEALS.
ALL OF THIS FOOD FOR SO LITTLE
MONEY, AND I CAN'T EVEN WATCH.
 40.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU
ANTICIPATING?
WHAT'S THE TASTE?
THAT TANGY BARBECUE SAUCE,
THAT'S CHEWINESS OF THE MEAT.
THIS IS-- JUST IMMACALATE, ALL
IN MY MOUTH.
 Jeff: GO FOR IT.
TENDER SLATHERED IN BARBECUE
SAUCE.
 EASY, WOO.
 Jeff: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!
 YEAH!
 WOO IS GOING TO GET WOOZY.
 WAY TO GO, WOO.
 OH, MY GOSH TLOOKED SMALLER
WHEN IT WAS UP THERE.
 Jeff: SO CLEARLY, SOMETHING
IS UP.
I'M SHOWING YOU THE ITEMS.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL ITEMS.
YOU HAVEN'T HAD FOOD IN A MONTH.
WHAT'S GOING ON, TONY?
WHAT IS IT YOU GUYS WANT?
 I'M HOPING FOR AN ADVANTAGE.
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MY ONLY
CHANCE TO BEAT SOME OF THESE
CHALLENGE BEASTS, JEFF.
 Jeff: SPENCER, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING ON?
 I CAN USE THE SAME THING AS
TONY.
 Jeff: TASHA?
 Jeff: MAYBE AN ADVANTAGE AS
WELL.
 Jeff: SO WE HAVE THREE
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR AN ADVANTAGE
RIGHT NOW.
SHALL WE JUST GET TO IT?
ALL RIGHT, NEXT ITEM PER YOUR
REQUEST IS AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS
GAME.
 500.
 Jeff: HOLD ON.
HERE'S HOW THE BIDDING WORKS.
IF THE BIDDING REACHES THE
MAXIMUM OF $500, THEN ANYBODY
WHO WANTS IN ON THE ACTION CAN
GET IN AT $500.
HERE'S THE CAVEAT-- IF THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE PERSON AT $500,
YOU'RE NOT BIDDING ON THE
ADVANTAGE.
YOU'RE BIDDING ON A CHANCE TO
DRAW ROCKS TO GET THE ADVANTAGE.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED, TIME TO
PUT UP OR SHUT UP.
 500.
 500.
 Jeff: TASHA?
YOU'RE OUT?
YOU WAITED ALL THIS TIME FOR AN
ADVANTAGE AND NOW YOU DON'T WANT
IN.
 YEAH, JEFF.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
SPENCER AND TONY, COME ON UP.
 BEST OF LUCK, SIR.
 AND TO YOU, MY FRIEND.
 Jeff: 500 FROM TONY.
AND EVERYTHING FROM SPENCER.
SO YOU GUYS WERE NEVER GOING TO
BID ON FOOD.
 NO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THERE ARE TWO ROCKS IN HERE.
ONE IS BLACK, ONE IS WHITE.
BLACK GETS YOU THE ADVANTAGE.
ALL RIGHT?
DO NOT LOOK AT IT.
KEEP IT COVERED.
OKAY, DON'T LOOK.
BOTH PUT YOUR PALMS OUT.
3, 2, 1.
BLACK IS THE ADVANTAGE.
TONY DRAWS BLACK.
 WHOOO!
$500 GETS YOU THIS, AN ADVANTAGE
IN THE GAME.
$500 GETS YOU A WHITE ROCK WHICH
YOU CAN KEEP.
 THANK YOU.
 WHOOO!
 WAY TO GO, TONE.
 Jeff: THAT IS IT FOR THE
"SURVIVOR" AUCTION.
 OH, MAN.
 I WAS HOPING THAT JEFF WOULD
OFFER ONE MORE ITEM AND THAT
WOULD BE A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I LEFT WITH
NOTHING.
SO IN ORDER FOR ME TO STAY HERE,
I HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITY.
 HOLY CRAP!
I WAS ALMOST PUKING JUST
WATCHING.
 I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE
BEST DEALS I'VE SEEN AT AN
AUCTION.
 BUT YOU SEE THIS RIGHT HERE?
IT'S LIKE A CATCH-22.
WE'RE STARVING SO WE DON'T HAVE
THE ENERGY.
EVEN IF WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE,
SOMEONE LIKE WOO WHO JUST ATE
THOSE RIBS, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
YOU WHO LOST THE DRAWING OF
ROCKS, STARVING AND NO
ADVANTAGE.
 @THE ONE WHO GOT SCREWED.
 IT'S JUST TOUGH MAN.
 WE KNEW WHAT WE SIGNED UP
FOR.
 IT'S TOUGH, IT'S TOUGH.
 I NEEDED AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
RIGHT NOW MY HEAD IS AT THE TOP
OF THE LIST ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
IT WAS DEVASTATING.
I DRAW THE ROCK, I OPEN MY HAND,
AND THE ROCK IS WHITE.
YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE A WHITE
ROCK.
I HAVE A NEW TITLE-- I'M THE
GREATEST LOSER AT THE AUCTION IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
 HERE'S MY ROCK.
 I WAS PLANNING ON HOLDING OUT
BUT WHEN EVERYBODY WAS HOLDING
AND-- I WAS LIKE 20 BUCKS, FINE.
I HAD NO GUILT THAT TONY WAS THE
MARTYR FOR THE TEAM.
I THINK I'VE DONE ENOUGH SO I
FELT GLAD.
HERE I AM EATING A GIANT MEAL,
AND I GOT TO SEE SPENCER HAVE
THE TRUE DEJECTED LOOK THAT I
HAVE COME TO KNOW AND LOVE AND
EXPECT FROM HIM WHEN HE KNOWS
HE'S ON THE BLOCK.
 HERE, TAKE A NAP.
 I JUST FEEL SO FULL, LIKE,
MISERABLE.
 THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE IN MY
ALLIANCE.
ALL OF THEM WERE EATING.
I SACRIFICED ALL THAT FOOD.
I'M STASHING SO I FELT KIND OF
DISGUSTED, YOU KNOW.
WHY PUT ALL THAT WEIGHT ON MY
SHOULDER?
DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO WATCH THE
FIRE OR SOMEBODY WANT TO GET THE
WATER.
GUYS?
 WAS IT CHICKEN QUESADILLA.
 CHICKEN AND CHEESE.
 THERE WAS CHICKEN IN THERE.
 YEAH.
 EXCUSE ME, LADIES?
DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO WATCH THE
FIRE WHILE I GET WATER, OR DOES
SOMEBODY WANT TO GET THE WATER
WHILE I DO THE FIRE.
 GET THE WATER FOR YOU.
 NOT FOR ME.
THE GIRLS DON'T DO ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS WANTED TO EAT.
I STARVED.
THIS IS WHAT I SACRIFICED NOT
EATING FOR RIGHT HERE.
SO AS MY ALLIANCE IS ALL TALKING
ABOUT HOW GOOD THEY FEEL THAT
THEY ATE THIS, THEY ATE THAT, I
SAID GUYS I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
PLEASE BE SOMETHING GOOD.
"AT THE END OF YOUR BEACH,
BEFORE THE ROCKS MEET THE SAND,
IS WHERE ANOTHER IDOL CAN BE
FOUND.
HIDDEN BEHIND THE BUSHES,
GUARDED BY A BIG, WHITE TREE.
IT'S JUST A FEW INCHES UNDER THE
GROUND."
OH, MY GOODNESS, MAN!
WOW!
I OPEN UP MY TUBE THEY WON AT
THE AUCTION TODAY, AND LO AND
BEHOLD, IT'S NOT AN ADVANTAGE IN
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
IT'S A CLUE TO A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
"AT THE END OF YOUR BEACH,
GUARDED BY A BIG, WHITE TREE."
THIS AIN'T A BIG, WHITE TREE.
MIGHT AS WELL START DIGGING.
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW, I HAVE A
SPECIAL POWER IDOL, AND NOW I
HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING
ANOTHER IDOL THAT I CAN JUST DO
WHATEVER I WANT WITH IT.
IF I CAN FIND IT, I DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.
ONCE I HAVE THIS BAD BOY, I'M IN
POWER.
WHAT'S BIG?
WHAT'S BIG?
 I LOVE THE OCEAN.
 ME, TOO.
 YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
 I DON'T HAVE IT.
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE
REALLY BEEN IN IT.
 YOU'RE KIDDING.
 I'VE BEEN ON VACATION BUT
I'VE BEEN REALLY LEERY.
IF THE GROUP OF FIVE STICK
TOGETHER THE PEOPLE ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK ARE SPENCER AND
MYSELF, SO I WANT TONY TO KNOW
THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
WE COULD FORM AN ALL-GIRL
ALLIANCE AND TAKE HIM OUT.
I WANT TONY TO SEE ME TALKING TO
THEM.
 I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
DOWN TO 10 MORE DAYS.
 TONY IS A LOOSE CANNON.
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS LIGHT A
LITTLE FIRE AND HE BASICALLY
WILL SPARK.
 TONY, YOU'RE SO THIN.
 I KNOW.
 THIS THING IS, LIKE,
STRUGGLING.
 THIS WILL GET IT STARTED.
THEY'VE BEEN IN THAT WATER LONG.
TASH GOT HER OWN PLABS, I SEE.
 WHAT?
 SHE'S WORKING ALL THE GIRLS.
YOU DON'T SEE HOW SHE'S SITTING
WITH THEM.
SHE'S BEST FRIEND NOW WITH ALL
THE GIRLS.
 I'M TELLING YOU, SINCE DAY
ONE, SHE IS A SOCIAL PLAYER.
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT 32 GIRL
THING ACTUALLY WORKING, ARE YOU?
 I DON'T KNOW, BRO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
 YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T LYING
WHEN WE SAID JEFRA WAS WITH US.
HER SAYING SHE WANTED TO VOTE
YOU OUT WASN'T A LIE.
 WHEN DID SHE WANT TO VOTE ME
OUT.
 TWO DAYS AGO.
SHE SAID WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT OUR BEST OPTION RIGHT NOW
BUT WE'RE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
TRYING TO BLINDSIDE TONY.
JEFRA SAID 100%, SHE PROMISES,
SHE WANTS TO BLINDSIDE YOU.
 WOW.
 I'M TRYING TO PLANT SEEDS
THAT WILL FESTER AND MAKE THIS
ALLIANCE SPLIT.
AND SO, IT MIGHT MEAN CREATING
SOME FAKE PARANOIA ABOUT AN
ALL-GIRLS' ALLIANCE, EVEN IF
IT'S NOT HAPPENING AT ALL.
IT'S VERY POWERFUL IN THIS GAME
RIGHT NOW.
SHE ALSO TOLD TASHA IF THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT THIS TRIBAL
COUNCIL, I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING
TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.
SO I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST
SAYING.
IF I CAN MAKE TONY PARANOID,
THAT'S GOLD.
BECAUSE TONY'S CRAZY.
TONY IS WILLING TO PLAY HARD BUT
NOT ALWAYS WELL.
AND THAT'S GREAT IN THIS GAME
BECAUSE IF I CAN GET SOMEONE IN
POWER TO MAKE MISTAKES AND GO
PLIFTIC, THEN, I'M STILL HERE
AND ANYONE COULD GO GOING HOME
AT THAT POINT.
 SHE ALSO SAID 100% THAT SHE
COULD SWING TRISH TO VOTE
AGAINST YOU.
AND THEN SHE FLIPPED BACK THE
NEXT DAY.
 I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
WHEN SPENCER TOLD ME THE GIRLS
COULD BE IN CAHOOTS WITH EACH
OTHER AND THEY WANT TO OUST THE
GUYS, I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW
WHAT?
HOLD UP.
DON'T TRUST SPENCER JUST YET
BECAUSE HE'S DESPERATE BUT YOU
HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT.
I'LL DEFINITELY KEEP THAT IN
MIND.
I'M NOT GOING TO OPEN UP AND
SPILL BEANS AND MAKE ANY
COMMOTION OUT HERE.
THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW
WHAT?
IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THE GUYS
ARE A THREAT AND LET'S GET RID
OF THEM ONE BY ONE AND THEY CAN
DO IT.
WE HAVE FOUR GIRLS AND THREE
GUYS.
OF COURSE, IT CARRIES WEIGHT,
MAN.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SIT ON
MY ASS AND GET BLINDSIDED.
ALL THE TALE TALE SIGNS ARE
THERE.
ILL TAKE MATTETS INTO MY OWN
HANDS LIKE I USUALLY DO.
 HE'S AN AWFULLY NICE KID.
 HE'S SO-- I MEAN, IT'S
SPENCE.
I LOVE HIM.
 HE'S GOING TO BE GREAT IN
LIFE.
 HE SAID SO SKINNY.
HE REALLY NEEDS TO PUT SOME
WEIGHT ON.
 I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT OUR
FIVE, BUT I JUST KICK BACK AND
RELAX AND IT'S NICE TO KNOW
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
NONADVERSARIAL DAY, BECAUSE NO
MATTER WHO WINS IMMUNITY, WE CAN
GET RID OF TASHA OR SPENCE.
YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END
OF THE TUNNEL.
 ADIOS, SPENCE.
 ADIOS.
 LET'S GET THAT CRAB OUT OF
THERE, MAN.
IT'S PROBABLY DEAD ALREADY.
 IS IT DEAD?
 YEAH, BRO.
LET'S GET THAT OUT.
 HEY, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO WITH THE CRAB?
IT'S DEAD.
IT-- IT'S OKAY THAT IT'S DEAD IN
THIS HEAT?
 PUT IT IN SOME WATER.
 THERE'S NO WATER BOILING.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET FIREWOOD.
 YOU NEED TO COOK IT PRETTY
SOON, THOUGH, BECAUSE OTHERWISE
IT WILL GO BAD.
THERE'S NO NEED TO WASTE FOOD.
 GET YOUR ASS UP HERE AND COOK
IT, THEN.
YOU HEAR THAT?
THE WATER PLAYING, BARKING
ORDERS.
WE NEED TO COOK IT SOON OR IT
WILL GO BAD.
SO GET YOUR ASS UP HERE AND COOK
IT AND BOIL WATER.
UNREAL.
AFTER FINDING ALL THAT OUT WITH
SPENCER, I SAID IT'S FOUR GIRLS
AND THREE GUYS, THEY MIGHT BE UP
TO SOMETHING.
THEY MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A POWER
MOVE.
I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GET THAT IDOL RIGHT
NOW.
THAT'S PRIORITY NUMBER ONE.
"AT THE END OF THE BEACH BEFORE
THE ROCKS, GUARDED BY A BIG,
WHITE TREE."
THAT'S A BIG WHITE TREE RIGHT
THERE.
NOW THIS IS A BIG, WHITE TREE.
THIS IS A BIG, WHITE TREE RIGHT
HERE.
WOW.
"HIDDEN BEHIND THE BUSHES."
HERE GOES NOTHING.
AND HERE IT IS.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS, FOR
SO LONG NOW.
COME TO PAPA!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR.
THAT'S THE THIRD IDOL THAT I
FOUND THIS GAME.
RIGHT NOW, I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO
IDOLS IN MY POSSESSION.
ONE SPECIAL ONE, AND ONE IDOL
THAT I COULD JUST PLAY AROUND
WITH.
I COULD USE IT FOR ME.
I COULD GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY TO
BLIND SOMEBODY ELSE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON TOP OF THE
WORLD, ON TOP OF THIS GAME.
 NICE.
IS IT THE SECRET ONE?
 NO.
THAT'S WHAT THE ADVANTAGE WAS.
MUCH BETTER ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME, RIGHT?
WAS IT WORTH ME STARVING.
 YEAH, BRO.
 LOOK AT THIS BIG BOY, MAN.
IT'S FOR ANYBODY.
I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO SHOW ME
MY ALLIANCE THAT IDOL.
I SHOWED EACH ONE.
I SAID I HAVE THE IDOL.
WE'RE PROTECTED.
THIS IS BETTER THAN AN ADVANTAGE
IN THE IMMUNITY.
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO TELL
THEM IS I'M PROTECTED SO DON'T
EVEN THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR ME.
THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.
IT'S STILL FOUR GIRLS, AND I
MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO TRY
TO SCARE THEM A LITTLE BIT JUST
IN CASE THEY'RE EVEN THINKING OF
PLOTTING TO VOTE AGAINST ME,
THEY KNOW I HAVE AN IDOL.
 I'VE NEVER SPENT $500 AND
BEEN SO HAPPY.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YUP.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TASHA, ONCE AGAIN, I WILL TAKE
IT BACK.
 YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FIGHT ME
FOR IT, JEFF.
 Jeff: JUST WIN IT AGAIN.
 ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE TO DIG UP BAGS IN
THE SAND.

BREAKING ALLIANCES, SO THE PLAN
ALL THE WAY UP TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
IS TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE
GIRLS-- AND HAVE TONY BE
SUSPICIOUS OF THE GIRLS.
IF HE'S FREAKING OUT THAT
THEY'LL FLIP, YOU KNOW, EITHER
WAY, IT WORKS FOR ME, AND
POSSIBLY FOR SPENCER AS WELL.
 NO BUENO, MY FRIEND.
 NO, IT WASN'T WHAT WE WERE
LOOKING FOR.
 YEAH.
 I WOULDN'T BE TOO CONCERNED.
THESE CHALLENGES JUST WENT HER
WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 YEAH.
 THEY BOTH HAVE TO GO, SO--
 RIGHT.
SPENCER GOES TONIGHT, AND SHE'LL
GO NEXT.
 YEAH.
 WHERE IS EVERYONE?
 THEY WENT TO GET WATER.
 SPENCE?
 WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
THAT.
YEAH.
OF COURSE.
 WHAT'S THAT?
 TONIGHT, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
IF TASH DIDN'T WIN THAT
NECKLACE, SHE WAS GOING HOME.
 OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW IT'S
SPENCE.
 YEAH.
 SO NOW WE HAVE TO RESULT TO
PLAN B, WHICH IS SPENCER.
 I CAN JOIN YOU GUYS?
 SURE.
 THIS IS THE WORST-CASE
SCENARIO FOR ME.
TASHA IS STILL HERE.
IT'S STILL FOUR GIRLS.
WITH SPENCE GONE IT'S TWO GUYS
NOW.
IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE IT'S FOUR
AGAINST TWO.
THEY COULD PICK US OFF ONE BY
ONE.
I HAVE TO TURN ON ONE OF THE
FEMALES IN MY ALLIANCE AND
THAT'S JEFRA.
SHE WAS WILLING TO ON ME.
SHE WAS WILLING TO TURN ON ALL
OF US.
IT'S ONCE AGAIN TIME TO CHANGE
THE GAME.
WHAT'S UP, WOO?
YOU WANT TO PULL A FAST ONE
TONIGHT?
 AND DO WHAT?
 GET RID OF JEFRA.
 AND KEEP SPENCER AND TASH.
 KEEP SPENCER AND TASH.
BECAUSE SHE HAS IMMUNITY.
IF WE GET RID OF SPENCER
TONIGHT, YOU AND I ARE DONE.
 RIGHT, RIGHT.
 WHY?
 THE GIRL-GUY RATIO.
 4-2.
WE HAVE TO GET RIDAVE GIRL
TONIGHT.
WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS GRAB
SPENCER AND SAY YOU WANT TO
STAY?
DOES TASHMENT YOU TO STAY, VOTE
JEFRA.
 TONY IS A BRILLIANT PLAYER.
NINE TIMES OUT OF 10 WE'RE
CLICKING ON THE SAME LEVEL.
WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW
WHAT THE GAME PLAN WAS.
WE CAN'T GET RID OF SPENCER.
 WE HAVE TO LOOK AHEAD, MAN.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WE COULD EASILY VOTE SPENCER
OFF TONIGHT, AND WE'RE DONE.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, I WON'T BE
ABLE TO TELL TRISH OR KASS THAT
I'M PLANNING THAT, SO WE'RE
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO NEED SPENCER
AND TASHA IN THIS.
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE A HERO
AND TRY TO SAVE YOU BECAUSE I DO
NOT WANT TO SEE YOU GO BEFORE
JEFRA.
I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU TO
GET RID OF JEFRA.
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE ME,
MAN, BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO
TELL TRISH.
I'M GOING TO TELL KASS.
 YOU'RE GOING TO TELL YOU,
TASH--
 NOT TASH.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL
TASH.
 THE THINGS I'VE SAID TO TONY
HAVE HAD AN EFFECT AND THIS
PARANOIA ABOUT AN ALL-GIRLS
ALLIANCE IS PERFECT.
TASHA IS TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO
DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME STAY.
SHE'S MY ALLIANCE.
SHE'S MY FRIEND.
I KNOW TASHA IS WILLING TO DO
SOMETHING THAT WILL KEEP ME IN
THE GAME.
YOU READY FOR "SURVIVOR" MIRACLE
PART TWO?
 YES.
 OKAY.
 SPENCE, TELL ME SOMETHING
GOOD.
 JEFRA.
OKAY.
TONY AND WOO DON'T TRUST HER,
AND THEY DON'T TRUST THE GIRLS.
AND THEY WANT TO VOTE OUT JEFRA.
AND THEY NEED US.
 WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?
FOR TWO OR THREE MORE DAYS I'LL
VOTE FOR JEFRA.
 TO FEEL JUST ABOUT HOPELESS
AND THEN BE GIVEN A GOLDEN
TICKET TO NEW LIFE IN THE GAME
IS INCREDIBLE.
 SHE'S IN.
 OKAY, BEAUTIFUL.
 THINGS MIGHT BE LOOKING UP
RIGHT NOW.
BUT I DON'T TRUST TONY ALL THAT
MUCH.
AND IF THIS PLAN FAILS, I'M OUT
OF THE GAME.
SO THIS NEW IDOL WITH
POTENTIALLY MORE POWERFUL POWERS
COULD REALLY HELP ME OUT.
 WHERE'S SPENCER?
DON'T TELL ME HE'S SEARCHING.
HEY, WOO, WHERE DID SPENCER GO?
 HE'S ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR
THAT IDOL, AND THAT TO ME IS
SCARY.
IT'S ALARMING THAT SPENCER WAS
DOING THAT WHEN I WAS TRYING TO
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO SAVE HIM.
SO I'M GOING THROUGH MY MIND IS
VOTING OFF JEFRA A GOOD IDEA?
IS IT GOOD FOR MY ALLIANCE?
IS IT GOOD FOR MY GAME, OR IS IT
BETTER JUST TO GET RID OF A
THREAT LIKE SPENCER BECAUSE
JEFRA IS REALLY NOT A THREAT.
SPENCER IS LETHAL OUT HERE.
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT HE'S DONE.
 EVERYONE IS SO QUIET.
 WHEN THE SUN STARTS TO GO
DOWN, IT'S TIME.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AT
THIS POINT.
I WOULD SAY I'M DRIVING MYSELF
CRAZY BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ME
DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY.
I THINK IT'S THE GAME THAT'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.
YO, WOO.
THERE'S GOING TO BE CHAOS
TONIGHT, MY FRIEND.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
SARAH.
MORGAN.
L.J.
AND JEREMIAH, VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO, SPENCER, WE GO INTO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WITH YOU AND
TASHA FEELING THE PRESSURE OF
NEEDING TO WIN.
 RIGHT.
 Jeff: TASHA GETS HER THIRD
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN.
YOU ARE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
EMPTY-HANDED.
 YES, ONE WOULD THINK THAT I
AM IN TROUBLE, BASED ON THIS
INFORMATION.
I PLAYED MY IDOL LAST TIME.
SO I AM PRETTY HELPLESS.
 Jeff: TONY, WHAT WAS THE
VIBE AT CAMP AFTER THE
CHALLENGE?
 PHEW!
JEFF, IT WAS CHAOTIC.
SPENCER CAME UP TO ME AND TRIED
TO CONVINCE ME THAT MY ALLIANCE
MEMBERS WANTED TO FLIP ON ME AND
BLINDSIDE ME, MORE SPECIFICALLY,
JEFRA.
SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
I'M NOT THE ONE TO GET
BLINDSIDED TONIGHT, JEFF.
 I WAS UPSET ABOUT ABOUT THE
L.J. SITUATION.
I WAS REALLY UPSET.
IT.
AND I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAT
HERE AND SAID I WASN'T.
 WHAT JEFRA HAD TO COME TO
TERMS WITH WAS GETTING OVER THE
ANGER OF THE BEING LEFT OUT.
 JEFF, YOU DON'T GO ADVERTISE
A BLINDSIDE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WITHHOLD IT
FROM PEOPLE YOU THINK MIGHT BLOW
YOUR COVER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
 Jeff: TONY, ARE YOU
SURPRISED THAT THIS GROUP IS
ABLE TO KEEP IT TOGETHER GIVEN
HOW MUCH CLEAR DISSENSION THERE
REALLY IS IN THE GROUP.
 THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE, JEFF,
IS THE BELIEF THAT WE'LL STAY
TOGETHER AND MOVE FORWARD.
WE HAVE TWO MORE VOTES,
HOPEFULLY, AND WE'LL BE TOP
FIVE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT PLAYS TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE, IT IS THIS-- CHAOS.
 CHAOS IS IT GREAT.
RIGHT NOW, I'M CLEARLY THE
TARGET.
SO IF I CAN MIX THINGS UP, CHAOS
CAN ONLY HELP ME.
 Jeff: DOES IT CONCERN YOU,
KASS, THAT THE WEIGHT OF WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A HEALTHY,
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY CAN SHIFT
TO WHERE THE DISFIRCHGZ WINS OUT
AND SOMEONE LIKE TRISH OR JEFRA
OR WOO OR TONY MAKE A MISTAKE?
 THERE COULD BE A MISTAKE MADE
TONIGHT.
I MEAN, PEOPLE'S HEADS ARE
SPINNING.
THERE'S PARANOIA EVERYWHERE.
 Jeff: JEFRA, YOU'RE JUST
NODDING-- THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS
TRUE.
 IT'S THAT TIMES 10, JEFF.
I MEAN, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE BOTTOM, YOU'RE GOING TO
TRY AND STIR UP AS MUCH AS YOU
CAN NORTHBOUND TO GET US TO
BREAK APART IN HOPES TO DO
SOMETHING FOR THEM.
 Jeff: SO SPENCER FIT IS
INDEED YOU TONIGHT, NOBODY CAN
ACCUSE YOU OF NOT MAKING BIG
MOVES.
SO HOW DOES THIS GAME END FOR
YOU?
 I THINK I PLAYED WELL, AND I
THINK I PLAYED HARD.
AND I CAN GO HOME HAPPY WITH
THAT.
AT THE SAME TIME, WINDOWS OF
OPPORTUNITY COME UP AND CLOSE IN
THIS GAME, AND SOME COULD BE
CLOSING RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU PICK ME OFF AND THEN PICK
OFF TASHA AND GET FOURTH OR
FIFTH PLACE, YOU MADE A MISTAKE
TONIGHT BY NOT MAKING A MOVE.
THE MOST COMMON REASON PEOPLE
LOSE THIS GAME IS NOT MAKING THE
MOVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WHEN
THEY COULD HAVE BECAUSE THEY GOT
TOO COMFORTABLE.
AND I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO SOMEONE THIS GAME.
 Jeff: AND WITH THAT, IT IS
TIME TO VOTE.
KASS, YOU'RE UP.
 I ALREADY SAVED YOU ONCE.
I'M NOT DOING IT AGAIN.
 THE MORAL OF THE STORY--
ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME BEFORE
YOU GET PLAYED.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW
WOULD BE THE TIME T TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, SPENCER.
JEFRA.
SPENCER.
JEFRA.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES JEFRA, TWO
VOTES SPENCER.
SPENCER.
THAT'S THREE VOTES SPENCER, TWO
VOTES JEFRA.
JEFRA.
WE'RE TIED.
THREE VOTES SPENCER, THREE VOTES
JEFRA, ONE VOTE LEFT.
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
JEFRA.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 Jeff: JEFRA, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
IT'S BEEN FUN.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, YOUR
REACTIONS SAY IT ALL.
ANOTHER BLINDSIDE.
IF THERE WERE ANY DOUBTS THAT
THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL GAME,
THOSE SHOULD BE PUT TO REST
TONIGHT.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":
 DON'T TELL ME WHAT I SAID.
 Jeff: EVERYONE IS TIRED OF
TONY'S ANTICS.
 I THINK I WILL WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN.
 YOU WRITE MY NAME DOWN AND
YOU'RE GOING HOME.
 HE'S AN IDIOT.
 Jeff: EVEN HIS CLOSEST
ALLIES.
 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, IF
I HAVE TO MAKE A BIG MOVE, I'LL
DEFINITELY DO IT.
 CLEARLY, SOMEBODY IN THE FIVE
ALLIANCE FLIPPED ON ME.
I SUSPECT WOO AND TONY BECAUSE
IF TONY WANTED TO GET ME OUT,
THEN WOO WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH
IT.
SO THEY FOOLED ME, AND WISHED I
WOULD HAVE JUMPED SHIP AT TRIBAL
SOONER THAN I HAD THE CHANCE.
BUT I'M NOT A PERSON WHO LIVES
WITH REGRETS SO THIS IS HOW THE
PLAYED THE GAME AND THIS IS HOW
I HAVE TO GO OUT.
