 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR."
AFTER A SURPRISE SWITCH, BRONZE,
BRAIN, AND BOUDY WERE NO MORE.
THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO
TRIBES.
 I'M THE ONLY ORIGINAL AYBARY
MEMBER ON A TRIBE WITH THREE
BRAIN AND THREE BEAUTIES.
 Jeff: OVER AT APARI, THE
FORMER BEAUTY TRIBE BEGAN TO








TURN ON EACH OTHER.
 ORIGINALLY JEREMIAH WAS WITH
US AND HE FLIPPED AND FLIPPED
BACK.
 L.J. AND HER CUDDLED
EVERNIGHT.
 ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH ALEXIS.

 Jeff: THE FORMER BRAIN
TRIBE USED IT TO GAIN CONTROL.
 THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THIS
DIVIDED SHOWS WE CAN PLAY THEM
AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 Jeff: MEANWHILE, THE FORMER








BRAWN TRIBE ENJOYED A 5-2
ADVANTAGE OVER L.J. AND JEFRA.
 IF WE CONTINUE WITH THE
PEOPLE WE HAVE, WE'RE IN A GREAT
POSITION.
 Jeff: BUT IT COULDN'T MEND
OLD FUSED.
 TRISH MAKES ME STICK.
LIKE, YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD.
STOP TRYING TO GET ATTENTION
FROM 20-YEAR-OLD MEN.
 Jeff: AND AT THE LAST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, SOLANA LOST.
 HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
 Jeff: FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL, THE FORMER BRAWN TRIBE
WAS FOCUSED ON GETTING RID OF
L.J.
 THE FOUR OF US ARE GOING TO
VOTE FOR L.J.
 FIRST?
 HELL, YEAH.
 Jeff: BUT TRISH AND TONY
SAW A CHANCE TO TAKE OUT AN EVEN
BIGGER THREAT.
 CLIFF IS A VERY INFLUENTIAL
PERSON WHICH MAKES HIM VERY
DANGEROUS.
 Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, TRISH AND TONY GOT
THEIR WISH, BLINDSIDING CLIFF
AND HIS ALLIES.
CLIFF, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
13 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 WELL, I JUST WANT TO MAKE A
FEW THINGS ON MY END CLEAR JUST
BECAUSE I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT.
I MEAN, LINDSEY, I JUST--
 TRISH, GET REAL.
 I'M TALKING.
 GET REAL, TRISH.
 EXCUSE ME, I'M TALKING FORA A
SECOND.
WE TOTALLY BAMBOOZLED CLIFF.
HE WAS SO CLUELESS HE WAS GOING
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.
 YOU GUYS JUST SCREWED UP
MAJORLY.
 AND WHO DO YOU THINK YOUR
ALLIANCES ARE?
 I DON'T HAVE ANY ALLIANCES
ANYMORE.
 NO, YOU DON'T.
THE CORE ALLIANCE WAS LINDSEY
AND CLIFF, PERIOD.
WE GOT RID OF CLIFF, AND SHE'S
ON HER OWN.
LET ME JUST MAKE THIS REALLY
CLEAR TO YOU.
 OKAY.
 MOVING FORWARD.
I WILL RESPECT YOU BECAUSE THIS
IS A TEAM MOVING FORWARD BUT I
DON'T LIKE YOU.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DISGUST ME.
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS
ANNOYING.
WHY YOU WERE LAUGH.
YOUR TEETH.
WHY YOU WERE FACE.
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, I CANNOT
STAND.
SO HOW ABOUT YOU JUST BACK OFF A
LITTLE BIT AND SHUT UP AND NOT
TALK TO ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE?
 SO-- SO YOU'RE TELLING US
YOU'RE NOT ON THE TEAM.
 I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, I'M NOT
ON YOUR TEAM.
I WILL NEVER BE ON YOUR TEAM.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE ANNOYING.
I THINK YOU'RE TERRIBLE.
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE THE MOST
HORRIFIC PERSON I EVER MET IN MY
LIFE.
 I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU DO
YOU THINK I'M ANNOYING?
 YES, I DO.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, NOW ASK ME IF
I CARE JAI DON'T CARE IF YOU
CARE.
 GOOD.
 THAT'S THE BEAUTY ABOUT IT.
I CAN LEAVE HERE AND NEVER THINK
OF YOU EVER AGAIN.
 ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE'RE DONE.
WE ALL KNOW WHERE WE ALL STAND
NOW.
LET'S JUST-- LET'S TRY TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT, MAN.
THAT'S IT.
 TRICIA STARTED IN ON ME, AND
SHE IS A BULLY.
SHE'S GOT THE MOUTH AS BIG AS A
( BLEEP ) HORSE, AND
EMOTIONALLY, I DON'T THINK I CAN
REALLY TAKE IT.
I CAN'T EVEN HONESTLY BE--
 I'M SORRY CLIFF IS GONE,
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO
REALLY MISS HIM AND I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.
 OH, YEAH.
I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITH TRICIA SO I'M GOING TO TAKE
WHATEVER SANITY I HAVE LEFT AND
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR THE
REST OF THE TIME BECAUSE I-- I'M
NOT GOING TO DO THIS.
I AM NOT GOING TO STICK AROUND
TRICIA'S MOUTH.
 WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE LINDY
IS, MAN, AND IT'S COLD OUT AND
IT'S NIGHT.
 I HOPE SHE'S ALL RIGHT, BRO.
 I'M SURE SHE'S JUST LICKING
HER WOUNDS.
SHE'S NOT USED TO BEING CALLED
OUT LIKE THAT.
 HEY, LINDSEY.
 HI.
 I GOT A CALL YOU WANTED TO
TALK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK TO
CAMP, TRISH JUST EXPLODES ON ME
WITH HER ANNOYING MOUTH.
 Jeff: WHAT WAS SHE SAYING
TO YOU?
 I MEAN, JUST AWFUL RIDICULOUS
THINGS LIKE-- I JUST CAN'T EVEN
PLAY ANYMORE.
AT THIS POINT, I CAN'T HAVE
SOMEONE ANTAGONIZING ME RIGHT
NOW.
 Jeff: WHAT RICONCERNED
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
 I'M GOING TO FLIP OUT ON HER.
AND THAT'S WHY I SEPARATED
MYSELF FROM THE SITUATION.
I'D RATHER, YOU KNOW, COST ME A
MILLION DOLLARS THEN FOR MY
DAUGHTER TO SEE HER MOM ACT LIKE
THIS.
 Jeff: SO THIS IS-- THIS IS
JUST BETWEEN AND YOU TRISH?
IT'S JUST A PERSONALITY
CONFLICT?
 BUT IT'S SO EXTREME.
AND I'M COLD DISPRKS I'M WET,
AND I'M HUNGRY.
AND I KNOW THAT, AND I'M TIRED.
I GET ALL THOSE THINGS, AND I
KNOW I'M GOING TO REGRET IT.
I NEED A MILLION DOLLARS MORE
THAN ANYBODY HERE.
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I CAN'T TAKE
IT ANYMORE.
 Jeff: YOU'RE QUITTING?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
 Jeff: I GOTTA SAY, THIS IS
A FIRST.
NO ONE HAS EVER QUIT BECAUSE
THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WERE GOING
TO DO SOMETHING THEY REGRETTED
AND SO THEY TOOK A MOMENT AND
SAID MY BEST MOVE IS TO JUST
MOVE ON.
 IT MAKES ME REALLY, REALLY
SAD.
THIS HAS BEEN A BIG STRUGGLE FOR
ME.
 Jeff: WHAT WAS THE LOWEST
POINT?
 I THINK WHEN I WALK AWAY FROM
THIS BEACH IS GOING TO BE MY
LOWEST POINT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO HOW
SHOULD WE TELL THE TRIBE?
 WELL, I WANT TO BE THE BIGGER
PERSON AND SAY WHY I'M LEAVING
BUT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BEST IF I
JUST DID A LITTLE CURTSY HERE
AND LEFT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
 Jeff: HEY, GUYS.
 HEY.
 OH, IT'S JEFF.
 Jeff: ANOTHER SO, I JUST
WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE
UPDATE.
 LINDZ DISAPPEARED FOR A WHILE
AND I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD GO
CHECK ON HER.
SHE LEFT IN HER BRA AND
UNDERWEAR.
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE HER, I
DIDN'T WANT HER TO INJURE
HERSELF.
 Jeff: I'M HERE TO
OFFICIALLY INFORM YOU, AFTER
LOSING CLIFF IN WHAT APPEARED TO
BE A BIG BLINDSIDE, LINDSEY IS
PULLING HERSELF FROM THE GAME.
 I DO FEEL BAD BECAUSE I KIND
OF CAME DOWN ON HER BUT SHE GOT
NASTY AND MEAN.
AND SHE WALKED AWAY AND I'M NOT
THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED SHE QUIT
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
CLIFF.
 JUST WHAT WE EXPECTED.
YOU TURN THE HEAD, THE BODY
FOLLOWS.
SHE WAS THE BODY, CLIFF WAS THE
HEAD, SHE FOLLOWED RIGHT BEHIND
HIM THE EXIT DOOR.
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING, TWO
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.
 THAT, OBVIOUSLY, WAS A HUGE,
VOLATILE ZIT WAITING TO POP, AND
ONCE IT DID, I MEAN, I THINK
THAT NOW WE'RE AT THE CORE.
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
NOW WE CAN START FRESH, HERE WE
ARE.
 PRIOR TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
WAS ALIGNED WITH CLIFF AND
LINDSEY, SO FOR CLIFF AND LINDY
TO BE GONE, NOW IT PUTS ME IN A
REALLY TOUGH POSITION.
IF WE WERE TO GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL, I COULD DEFINITELY
PROJECT MYSELF GOING.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
APARRI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW SOLANA TRIBE.
 LINLDZY?
 WHAT!
 Jeff: CLIFF VOTED OUT AT
LAST NIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,
HOURS LATER, LINDSEY QUIT.
 WHAT!
 Jeff: PULLED HERSELF FROM
THE GAME FOR PERSONAL REASONS.
SOARA, YOU CAN'T CONTAIN
YOURSELF.
 OH, MY GOSH!
THIS IS-- INSANE!
 Jeff: ALEXIS, I'M SURPRISED
AT THE EMOTION.
WHAT IS IT?
 I'M HAPPY TO SEE OUR BEAUTIES
STILL STANDING, YOU KNOW?
I'M HAPPY, OF COURSE.
 Jeff: SPENCER, YOU'RE
NODDING YOUR HEAD, THIS IS GOOD,
GOOD NEWS, I LIKE IT.
 TWO PEOPLE ARE OUT OF THE
GAME AND I DIDN'T HAVE HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING.
IT BOTHERS ME THAT SOMEONE QUIT.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT.
BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.
MY ODDS JUST GOT A LOT BETTER
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A THING.
 Jeff: JUST LIKE THAT THE
SOLANA TRIBE IS DOWN TO NINE
MEMBERS, APARRI IS SEVEN, AND
THE GAME HAS CHANGED AGAIN.
ARE YOU READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
AWARD CHALLENGE?
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL
SQUARE OFF ONE ON ONE.
YOU'LL EACHING HOLDING AN IDOL.
YOUR JOB, KNOCK THEIR IDOL OFF
BEFORE THEY KNOCK OFF YOURS.
EVERY TIME YOU DO, YOU SCORE A
POINT FOR YOUR TRIBES.
FIRST TO FOUR WINS REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES!
 Jeff: TWO MEMBERS OF THE
WINNING TRIBE WILL FOLLOW THE
LOSING TRIBE BACK TO THEIR BEACH
AND PERFORM A CAMP RAID.
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO
BETTER YOUR LIFE AND INFLICT A
LOT OF PAIN ON THE OTHER TRIBE.
APARRI, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA
MEMBERS.
YOU CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME
PEOPLE IN BACK-TO-BACK
CHALLENGES.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SIT OUT?
ALEXIS AND KASS.
HERE WE GO, ONE MAN VERSUS ONE
MAN.
SPENCER HEADING OUT VERSUS WOO.
 COME ON, WOO.
 Jeff: IT'S VERY SIMPLE--
YOU KNOCK THEIR IDOL OFF BEFORE
THEY KNOCK OFF YOURS YOU EARN A
POINT.
GO.
WOO AND SPENCER.
WOO SMILING, TAUNTING SPENCER.
 YOU GOT THIS, WOO.
USE YOUR FOCUS.
NINJA.
 Jeff: THIS IS A SHOWDOWN.
WHO WILL MAKE THE BIG MOVE
FIRST?
 PATIENCE, WOO.
 Jeff: SPENCER GETTING
CLOSER, TAUNTING WOO NOW.
SPENCER GOES FOR IT AND
SUCCEEDS!
APARRI SCORES AND LEADS 1-ZIP.
 GOOD JOB, SPENCER!
 Jeff: NEXT ROUND, IT IS
TRISH FOR SOLANA TAKING ON TASH
FOR ATTARRA.
GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
TONY TAKING ON MORGAN.
MORGAN GOES AFTER HIM.
BUT MORGAN'S DROPS FIRST.
SOLANA SCORES AND
WE'RE BACK TO THE TOP.
A REMATCH FROM OUR FIRST ROUND.
 COME ON.
 Jeff: THIS COULD BE IT.
SPENCER AND WOO.
 COME ON, WOO.
 Jeff: WOO COULD WIN IT FOR
SOLANA.
 GOT THE REACH.
 Jeff: SPENCER HAS TO WIN IN
ORDER TO KEEP APARRI IN THIS.
SPENCER WON THE FIRST TIME.
 COME ON, WOO!
WE COULD REVISIT OUR OLD TRIBE.
 FEED THE FAMILY, KID.
 COME ON, SPENCE, THINK OF
WHAT WE CAN'T LOSE.
 Jeff: HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
 COME ON, SPENCER.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: WOO WALKS STRAIGHT AT
SPENCER.
 PATIENCE, SPENCE.
 Jeff: SPENCE WER A LONG
REACH.
WOO NOT BUDGING.
HE'S COMING CLOSE.
 THERE YOU GO, WOO, THERE YOU
GO, GET HIM OFF BALANCE.
WOO.
THERE YOU GO!
 Jeff: BIG MOVE BY WOO, BUT
SPENCER HANGS TIGHT.
 YOU GOT IT, SPENCE.
 Jeff: SPENCER NOT BACKING
DOWN.
ANOTHER SHOW-DOWN BETWEEN THESE
TWO.
 GO AHEAD, WOO.
GO AHEAD, WOO.
 Jeff: SOLANA WINSES REWARD!
SOLANA CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE
GOING TO SELECT TWO PEOPLE WHO
WILL LEAVE AND GO BACK TO APARRI
TO THEIR CAMP.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
WOO AND TONY.
THIS IS A NOTE.
KEEP IT SEALED UNTIL YOU GET TO
THEIR BEACH.
THEN YOU TWO READ IT TOGETHER
AWAY FROM THEM.
IT WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
ALL RIGHT?
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: TONY, WOO, JOIN THIS
TRIBE.
 WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.
 Jeff: SO, TONY, YOU HAVE AN
IDEA, A VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT
APARRI HAS.
 I KNOW APARRI INSIDE OUT,
JEFF, THAT'S WHY I'M GOING.
 Jeff: TRISH, JEFRA, L.J.,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP AND AWAIT THE
RETURN OF YOUR TRIBEMATES WITH
THEIR TAKE.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GRAB YOUR
STUFF.
HEAD OUT.
SHOULD MAKE FOR AN INTERESTING
AFTERNOON.
 THERE'S SO MUCH MORE ENERGY
IN THE CAMP NOW THAT CLIFF IS
GONE AND NOW THAT LINDSEY'S
GONE.
WE WENT THERE AND WE MADE A
STATEMENT.
WE'RE LESS IN NUMBERS BUT WE'RE
HIGH IN MORAL AND WE SHOWED IT
TO THEM AND WE WON THE
CHALLENGE.
AND THE REWARD TODAY IS A TRIBE
RAID.
SO WHEN TONY AND WOO CAME, LIKE,
OUR HEARTS DROPPED.
 HEY, WELCOME HOME.
 THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A NOTE FROM JEFF THAT WE
HAVE TO GO DOWN AND READ AND
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, ALL RIGHT?
 I CAME FROM LUZON, AND WE
WERE LIVING IN PRETTY BAD
CONDITIONS SO WHEN WE GET OVER
TO APARRI WE WERE, LIKE, THIS IS
THE LAP OF LUXURY, AND WHO KNEW
IT WOULD BE SO SHORT-LIVED.
 OR THE TARP AND ROPE, OR THE
FISHING KIT.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER THREE.
YOU CAN HURT THEM WITH THE TARP?
 WHATEVER.
 YEAH.
SO AFTER WINNING TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE JEFF GAVE US
INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT WE COULD DO
TO THE TRIBE AND THERE WAS A
PART TWO.
AND IT WAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE ROCKS,
MUCH EASIER WHEN THE TIDE IS
RIGHT.
SPEND SOME TIME ON THE REEF
TODAY.
THAT'S FOR US, RIGHT?
THAT'S FOR US.
WOO AND MYSELF READ IT AND IT
DIDN'T PER TAIN TO THE SOLANA
BEACH.
IT PERTAINED TO THE SOLANA WHERE
WE HAVE A WALL OF ROCKS.
 I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT TO
TRY TO OUST ONE OF THESE PEOPLE,
STIR UP THE POT, AND THE
STRONGEST PERSON ON THE APARRI
TEAM RIGHT NOW IS JEREMIAH.
HERE'S THE DEAL.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR
COMFORT.
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE FISHING
GEAR.
AND WE HAVE THE CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND WE GET TO
ELECT THIS WHICHONE OF YOU GUYS
TO GIVE IT TO.
WOO AND I BOTH DECIDED WE WILL
GIVE IT TO JEREMIAH.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE SIDE OVER
THERE.
COMFORT AND THE FISHING STUFF.
 TONEY AND WOO DECIDE TO GIVE
JEREMIAH A CLUE TOO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.
SO, HONESTLY, I THINK THEY'RE
SENDING A SIGNAL TO JEREMIAH
THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.
 THIS IS THE IDOL CLUE.
YOU READ IT BY YOURSELF.
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH
IT, OKAY.
AND THE FISHING NET.
WE JUST WANT THE FISHING NET.
SO I GAVE HIM THE CLUE.
MEANWHILE I'M SURE IT WAS GOING
THROUGH EVERYBODY'S MIND AT THE
TRIBE, WHY IS JEREMIAH GETTING
THE CLUE?
WHAT IS GOING ON?
SO THEIR WHEELS ARE SPINNING
LIKE HE'S GOING TO GO FIND THE
IDOL, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
 TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE ROCKS
MUCH EASIER WHEN THE TIDE IS
RIGHT.
SPEND?
TIME ON THE REEF TODAY.
I OPENED UP THE CLUE AND
INTERESTED, AND IT'S THE EXACT
SAME CLUE WE HAD AT THE BEAUT
TRIBE.
 THE CHOSEN ONE.
 THE CHOSEN ONE.
FOR SOME ODD REASON.
 I WAS, LIKE, YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING.
YOU KNOW, TONY AND WOO, THEY
DON'T KNOW ME FROM ADAM, THEY
JUST SAID, "WE'VE GOT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE AND WE CHOOSE
JEREMIAH.
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO HIM."
 SEE YOU, GUYS.
 I'VE GOT SIX PEOPLE WATCHING
ME.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING
EVERY MOVE I MAKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 I GOTTA TAKE BACK THE CLUE.
 HEY, GUYS.
 WOOO-WOOOO.
 DO I SEE A BAG OF RICE?
 WE WERE GIVEN A NOTE TELLING
US WHAT WE COULD TAKE.
 YOU COULDN'T TAKE THEIR RICE?
 NO.
 SALT AND PEPPER?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 AND THE FRY PAN?
 FLIED RICE!
 TONY AND WOO BROUGHT BACK
TONS OF COMFORT ITEMS.
WE HAVE A MOSQUITO NET, PILLOWS,
BLANKETS, SPICES, SALT, PEPPER,
THINGS L.J. AND I HAVEN'T GOT TO
ENJOY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
 THIS IS THE BEST PART.
THIS IS A CLUE TO AN IDOL.
 HERE?
 YES.
 YES.
 FIRST WE READ IT, AND WE
THOUGHT IT PERTAINED TO THAT
TRIBE BUT IT DOESN'T.
THIS IS A WALL OF ROCKS AND
THAT'S A WALL OF ROCKS.
I TOLD THEM THIS LETTER TOLD US
WE GET TO ELECT ONE PERSON FROM
THEIR TRIBE TO GIVE THEM A CLUE
TO AN IDOL.
WE CALLED JEREMIAH OUT THERE SO
WE PUT A BIG, ILLUMINATING
TARGET ON HIS BACK.
 TONY IS PLAYING THIS GAME
FULL OUT.
YOU KNOW, HARD CORE, BALLS TO
THE WALLS.
EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.
HE'S LYING, STEALING AND
CHEATING AND I'M JUST GLAD HE'S
ON MY SIDE.
 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS
ANOTHER THING, TOO.
I AM A POLICE OFFICER.
I WAS ONLY KIDDING AROUND
CONSTRUCTION.
 I KNEW IT!
 THAT'S CLEVER.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
 I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.
I BONDED WITH
BY ANY MEANS,
AND I REALIZE BY HIM EXPOSING
ALL THAT STUFF, THAT I DO NEED
TO BE ON MY TOES EVERY SINGLE
POINT IN THE GAME.
 WE ARE STICKING TOGETHER, THE
FIVE.
 YOU ARE-- I LOVE YOU MORE NOW
THAN I DID AN HOUR AGO.
 I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO
SAY THIS GUY IS A LIAR.
WHEN CAN WE BELIEVE HIM?
THIS IS WHEN YOU CAN BELIEVE ME
TO THE END?
 I HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETHING TO
YOU GUYS THAT I HAVEN'T
ADMITTED.
I'M REALLY A MAN.
 OH, I KNEW IT!
 TONY AND WOO TOLD US THAT
THEY HAD A CLUE TO OUR HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND THEY GOT TO
ELECT ONE PERSON TO SHARE IT
WITH.
THEY PICKED JEREMIAH, WHICH GOT
SO MANY MINDS THINKING, AND
REALLY STIRRED STUFF UP OVER
HERE.
SO I NEED TO CLEAN IT UP AND I
NEED TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT
MORE CLEAR CUT BECAUSE THE ONE
PERSON RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK IS
THE MOST UNTRUSTWORTHY IS
JEREMIAH.
JEREMIAH IS SO UNPREDICTABLE.
I JUST THINK HE'S SO DUMB THAT
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO LIE OR
ANYTHING.
 ALEXIS CAME UP TO ME AND IT
ALMOST SEEMED LIKE SHE HAD
PLANNED WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY
WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME SHE COULD
BE PLAYING US A LITTLE BIT AND I
THINK ALEXIS IS A LITTLE SMARTER
THAN SHE THRIEKS LET ON.
 WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS I
COUNT SEVEN AND I'M NOT IN IT.
 YEAH.
 IT'S THE FIVE OF THEM OVER
THERE, JEREMIAH AND SARAH.
 I LIKE GIRLS WHO OWN HOW
SMART THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN
DO.
YOU KNOW, ALEXIS IS PRETTY PHONY
TO ME.
SO I THINK THAT HURTS HER.
SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED OF AS
FAR AS MAKING MOVES.
 YEAH.
 WE LOST.
WHY WOULD WE GET A CLUE?
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
THEY WON--
 SO YOU'RE THINKING IT'S NOT A
CLUE.
 IT'S NOT A CLUE.
 WHAT WAS IT?
 IT'S THE SAME CLUE WE HAD AT
THE OTHER CAMP, THE EXACT SAME
CLUE.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
 THE EXACT SAME CLUE.
I READ IT.
THE CLUE THEY GOT FROM TONY IS
THE SAME CLUE THAT WE HAD AT THE
OTHER TRIBE.
HE SAID HE HAD TO TAKE IT BACK
WITH HIM SO I HANDED IT TO HIM,
AND HE TOOK OFF.
TONY'S MADE A MESS FOR ME.
NOW I GOTTA WORK MY WAY THROUGH
IT.
 YOU'RE TELLING ME THEY CAME
OVER HERE WITH THEIR CLUE--
 THEY CALLED ME OUT IN FRONT
OF ALL OF Y'ALL--
 I THINK YOU'RE PARANOID OR
SOMETHING.
 WHO?
 YOU.
 THEY'RE WANTING YOU ALL TO
VOTE AGAINST ME TO GET ME OUT OF
HERE.
I'M NOT PARANOID AT ALL.
 JEREMIAH'S STORY IS TOUGH TO
BUY.
WHAT I THINK IS JEREMIAH GOT A
NEW CLUE.
IT WAS WRAPPED.
IT WAS A REAL CLUE.
AND IT LOOKED A CLUE TO AN IDOL
THAT'S ACTUALLY HERE.
HE'S NOT FOOLING ANYONE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
 Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TASHA, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL
USE WOODEN POLES TO BUILD A
STAIRCASE.
YOU'LL RACE THROUGH A BAMBOO
MAIZE.
THEN DOWN A SLIDE.
ONE PUBLISH UPON MANEUVER A KEY
THROUGH A ROPE OBSTACLE.
THEY'LL USE THE KEY TO UNLOCK
THE MACHETE.
YOU'LL USE WANT MACHETE TO
RELEASE PUZZLE PIECES.
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS WILL THEN USE
THOSE PIECES TO SOLVE A PUZZLE,
WHICH WILL REVEAL THREE NUMBERS
TO A COMBINATION LOCK.
FIRST TRIBE TO SOLVE THEIR
COMBINATION LOCK AND RAISE THEIR
FLAG WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
THE VOTE.
LOSERS,UN THE DRILL.
TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY WILL BE
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
APARRI, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA
PEOPLE.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SIT OUT?
CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME PEOPLE
IN BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.
 I'LL SIT OUT.
 Jeff: TAKE A SPOT ON THE
SITOUT BENCH, GIVE YOU A EMPTY
TO STRATEGIZE, WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
FIRST STAGE IS BUILDING A
STAIRCASE.
SHORTEST PIECES WILL BE IN THE
FRONT.
TALLEST WILL BE AT THE BACK.
ONCE IT'S BUILT, CLIMB UP IT AND
START THROUGH THE BAMBOO MAZE.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: L.J. GOES DOWN IN THE
DEEP MUD.
IT'S BEEN RAINING AND THIS
COURSE IS ROUGH.
GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY BE
MINDFUL OF WHERE YOU WALK.
SOLANA ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THEY'VE GOT TALL PIECES SHORTER,
THEN TALLER PIECES.
 TAKE THIS ONE OUT.
TAKE THIS ONE OUT.
TAKE THIS ONE OUT?
 TAIRKS IT OUT!
 Jeff: APARRI HAS THEIRS
FIRST.
APARRI HEADING UP.
SOLANA STILL TRYING TO GET IT
TOGETHER.
TERRIBLE START FOR SOLANA.
INOUS OF NOW YNOW YOU CAN GO.
MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THAT MAZE.
JUST FOLLOW IT.
IF IT'S BLOCKED, YOU CAN'T GO
THERE.
FIND THE OPENING.
 COME OAPARRI!
 Jeff: SOLANA WORKING
TOGETHER WELL.
APARRI WORKING TOGETHER WELL.
SARAH WORKING ON THE KNOT FOR
APARRI.
WOO ON THE KNOT.
WOO IS DOWN.
SARAH HAS THE KNOT UNDONE.
 GO, GO!
 COME ON.

 Jeff: WE ARE NECK AND NECK

THREE DOWN FOR APARRI.
EVERYBODY DOWN FOR BOTH TRIBES.
ONE PERSON NOW START WORKING
WITH THAT KEY.
IT'S TONY FOR SOLANA.
JEREMIAH FOR APARRI.
 COME ON, JEREMIAH.
 COME ON, JEREMIAH!
THERE YOU GO, JEREMIAH!
STAY WITH IT, BUDDY!
 Jeff: ONCE YOU'RE THROUGH,
YOU'LL RELEASE THAT KEY.
YOU CAN UNLOCK THE MACHETE.
JEREMIAH HAS RELEASED HIS KEY.
UNLOCK THAT MACHETE.
TONY RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
JEREMIAH'S RELEASED THE MACHETE.
TONY NOW HAS RELEASED HIS KEY.
JEREMIAH HAS THE PIECES FREE.
EVERYBODY THROUGH NOW.
 LET'S GO!
LET'S GO!
 Jeff: TONY STILL WORKING ON
THAT LOCK.
TWO PEOPLE NOW GATHER THE PUZZLE
PIECES, ONLY TWO.
TONY COSTING HIS TRIBE A LOT OF
TIME.
TONY'S GOT THE MACHETE.
AND HE'S RELEASED THE PIECES.
EVERYBODY GOT TO GET THROUGH
FIRST.
NOW GO.
 COME ON, COME ON!
 Jeff: APARRI'S ALREADY
GATHERED ALL THEIR PIECES.
YOU'RE BUILDING A PUZZLE FROM
THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP IN ORDER.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE
NUMBERS.
THOSE THREE NUMBERS WILL SOLVE
THE COMBINATION.
BIG IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.
 HERE, TRY THAT.
 Jeff: APARRI NOW STARTING
TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS.
 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 41, YOU'RE
LOOK FOR 41, 41.
 TURN IT OVER.
THIS ONE?
 YEAH.
PUT IT IN THERE, MAN.
PUT IT IN THERE.
 Jeff: L.J. AND WOO ARGUING
OVER WHICH PIECE GOES WHERE.
L.J. IS CERTAIN HE'S RIGHT.
THESE NUMBERS BETTER MAKE SENSE
OR THEY'RE NOT RIGHT.
 TOP OF THE 9.
 Jeff: YOU MIGHT HAVE A
PIECE IN THERE THAT LOOKS RIGHT.
& ISN'T.
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
RIGHT.
 OR A 67.
 Jeff: BOTH TRIBES TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT THAT SECOND NUMBER.
 WHAT NUMBER IS THAT?
 67?
 THAT'S NOT A NUMBER.
FLIP IT.
 Jeff: L.J. AND WOO NOW
TRYING ANOTHER NEW COMBINATION.
THEY'RE GOING WAY BACK AND
STARTING OVER.
L.J. THINKS HE MAY HAVE FIGURED
SOMETHING OUT.
 THAT'S IT!
THAT'S NOT IT.
 YOU GUYS, YES, IT IS.
 Jeff: APARRI STILL DEBATING
THAT SECOND NUMBER.
 COME ON, COME ON!
 Jeff: L.J. WITH ANOTHER
PIECE AND TOORG.
 WE GOT THIS!
WE GOT THIS!
SOLANA WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
 Jeff: SOLANA WITH TWO MORE
PIECES.
APARRI STARTING TO PANIC.
 67, COME ON.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 Jeff: THEY THINK THEY'VE
GOT IT.
L.J. TAKES A HARD FALL.
 41.
 Jeff: IF THEY'RE RIGHT THIS
WILL OPEN THE COMBINATION LOCK
AND IMMUNITY FOR SOLANA.
 67.
 Jeff: SOLANA WINS IMMUNITY.
 YEAH!
 YEAH!
WHOOO!
 Jeff: SOLANA,
CONGRATULATIONS.
BIG IMMUNITY.
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR SOLANA.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
APARRI, SOMEBODY FROM THIS GROUP
IS GOING HOME.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.
 TONY YELLING OUT, "TOP FIVE!
WE'VE MADE THE FINAL FIVE!"
I COUNTED FIVE PEOPLE OVER THERE
AND I WASN'T STANDING OVER THERE
SO I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY TEL
TELLTALE SIGN I'M NOT INCLUDED
IN THEIR PLANS SO I GUESS I'LL
MOVE ON AND I'LL MAKE A NEW
ALLIANCE.
LOST A CHALLENGE, AND IT SUCKS
ABUSE NOW WE HAVE TO GO TO
TRIBAL, AND I HATE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
IT'S, LIKE, THE WORST PLACE IN
THE WORLD.
 TONY MADE THE DUMBEST MISTAKE
ON EARTH BY YELLING OUT, "TOP
FIVE."
 RIGHT.
 THAT WAS RIDICULOUS.
 YEAH, THAT WAS STUPID.
 WE'RE SEVEN RIGHT NOW, AND
WE'LL BE SIX TOMORROW.
 AFTER THE CHALLENGE, THE NEW
SOLANA TRIBE WERE CELEBRATING
AND TONY BLATANTLY SHOUTED, "TOP
FIVE!
TOP FIVE!"
 "TOP FIVE, BABY!"
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HOW YOU SAY THAT IN JERZ GEE
YEAH, BABY.
 WE'RE TOP FIVE.
LOOK AT MY MUSCLES?
THEY'RE STILL HERE.
 THEIR CONFIDENCE REALLY
REVEALED A LOT TODAY.
 I DON'T GET THAT.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOP 5
WHEN YOU HAVE LESS NUMBERS?
 LESNUMBERS.
 THEY GOTTA THINK ONE OF THE
NEW APARRI IS WITH THEM
POST-MERGE.
AND THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT
ANYBODY FROM THAT TRIBE HAS
TALKED TO IS JEREMIAH, SO I
THINK THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY
HAVE JEREMIAH AS THEIR SIXTH
NUMBER.
00.
 I'M WORRIED ABOUT JEREMIAH
FLIPPING BECAUSE THEY WERE
RANTING ABOUT THEIR TOP 5, AND
THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT UNLESS
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THE
NUMBER.
 RIGHT.
 AND THE ONLY PERSON THEY
TALKED TO WAS JEREMIAH.
 MORGAN AND MYSELF BOTH KNOW
HE WILL GIVE YOU HIS WORD AND BE
NOT HONEST ABOUT IT.
HE'LL LIE ABOUT IT.
 ALEXIS TRIES TIDE TO CONVINCE
US WE NEED TO BLINDSIDE
JEREMIAH.
ALEXIS IS TRYING TO MAKE US
THINK JEREMIAH WILL FLIP.
I THINK WE'RE GOOD ON IT.
 I REALLY THINK IT'S THE
SAFEST WAY TO GO.
 SO FOR SURE, YOU GUYS,
JEREMIAH?
 AND YOU GIVE US YOUR WORD FOR
SURE.
 YOU HAVE MY WORD ON
EVERYTHING EVERYONE CAN LOOK, NO
FINGERS CROSSED, NO NOTHING.
I WILL NOT FLIP.
 WE BELIEVE YOU.
 SO--
 THE BRAIN TRIBE CAN REALLY GO
EITHER WAY RIGHT NOW.
IN A MERGE SITUATION, JEREMIAH
IS A LIABILITY.
IT'S A QUESTION OF WHO'S THE
BIGGER LIABILITY, JEREMIAH OR
ALEXIS?
BOTH HAVE CONNECTIONS ON THE
OTHER SIDE.
BOTH COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE
DEALS AGAINST US.
WE'LL SAY YES TO ALEXIS' PLAN.
WE'LL TELL HER THAT JEREMIAH
BEING BLINDSIDE MAKES SENSE FOR
US AND THEN WE'LL MAKE THE
DECISION OF WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES
SENSE FOR US.
 I'M JUST THINKING WHAT
MEASURES DO WE NEED TO TAKE TO
PLAN FOR THE MERGE?
 FOR TONIGHT, IT DOES SEEM
THAT THE BRAINS ARE KIND OF IN
CONTROL.
I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS WE'RE
THREE TIGHT PEOPLE AND WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE AS A BLOC.
WE COULD GO WITH ALEXIS AND GET
RID OF JEREMIAH OR WE COULD VOTE
OUT ALEXIS.
EVERYONE IS GOING TO FOLLOW OUR
LEAD SO I THINK THE BRAINS ARE
IN A GREAT POSITION AND WE JUST
NEEDED PEOPLE TO BOSS AROUND.
THE BRAIN NEED A BODY.
WE FOUND OUR ZOMBIES.
NOW, WE'RE IN.
 Jeff: SARAH, THERE'S A
TORCH WAITING FOR YOU.
GRAB IT, DIP IT IN THE FLAME,
AND GET FIRE.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE
YOU.
SO KASS, JUST LOOKING FROM THE
OUTSIDE, YOU COULD MAKE THE
ASSUMPTION THAT THE THREE FORMER
BRAIN TRIBE ARE TOGETHER, THE
THREE FORMER BEAUTY TRIBE ARE
TOGETHER AND SARAH WOULD BE IN
THE MIDDLE.
 THAT'S A PRETTY CORRECT
ASSUMPTION, JEFF.
 Jeff: MOTHERAP, BEAUTY
TRIBE, TIGHT?
 I MEAN, I THINK JEREMIAH AND
I SORT OF HAD BUMPS IN THE ROAD.
 Jeff: JEREMIAH?
 YOU KNOW, YEAH, I TOLD A LIE
TO MORGAN.
I DECIDED TO VOTE OUT BRICE, AND
IT PUT A BIG VOID IN BETWEEN ME
AND MORGAN SO I BACKED OFF FROM
HER, JUST GAVE HER SOME SPACE.
 Jeff: KASS, LOOKING AT THE
ISSUES BETWEEN MORGAN AND
JEREMIAH, DOES THAT GIVE YOU A
LITTLE COMFORT?
 YEAH.
YOU THINK THE PRETTY PEOPLE WERE
LIVING A BEAUTIFUL LIFE, AND YOU
LEARN IT WASN'T SO BEAUTIFUL
OVER THERE.
SO THE BRAINS GET A LITTLE
BREATH OF FRESH AIR.
DESPITE WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
IT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.
WHEREAS WHAT THEY'VE GONE
THROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE DRICHEN
THEM APART.
 Jeff: SPENCER, DOES THIS
BENEFIT THE THREE OF YOU FROM
THE BRAIN TRIBE?
 YEAH, I THINK IT BENEFITS US.
BUT I THINK WHAT WE
FOCUS ON IS FIXING THE FRACTURES
AND GOING FORWARD WAY UNIFIED
TRIBE.
 Jeff: SASHA, SPENCER BRINGS
UP A GOOD POINT.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET TO THE
END, AND YOU ANTICIPATE A MERGE,
IT NEEDS TO BE A TIGHT GROUP
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING ON THE OTHER TRIBE.
YOU CAN'T COUNT ON OLD
RELATIONSHIPS.
 I THINK TODAY I FIGURED OUT I
WAS STANDING ALONE.
WHEN WE'RE AT THE CHALLENGE AND
TONY SHOUTS OUT, "TOP 5, FIND
5!"
WELL, I COUNTED FIVE PEOPLE OVER
THERE, AND I DON'T SEE SARAH IN
THAT.
THEY'VE CLEARLY MOVED ON WITHOUT
ME.
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO CUT TIES WITH THEM.
 Jeff: IS THAT A WELCOME
ADDITION, ALEXIS, HAVING SARAH
SAY, "I'M DONE WITH THE OTHER
TRIBE?"
 YEAH, IT SOUNDS GOOD IN
THEORY, BUT THERE'S ALSO ROOM
FOR SOMEONE TO STILL RECONNECT
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT, ESPECIALLY IN TONIGHT'S
VOTE.
 Jeff: SO WHO'S IN TROUBLE
TONIGHT, TASHA, WHAT ARE YOU
FEEL?
 WELL, JEFF, THE BEAUTIES ARE
IN TROUBLE IF THEY'RE FRACTURED,
AS THEY APPEAR TO BE.
 Jeff: ALEXIS, TELL ME ABOUT
THE CAMP RAID.
 WELL, I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE
MOST INTERESTING PART WAS WHEN
THEY DECIDE TO PULL JEREMIAH
ASIDE, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS JUST
THEIR WAY OF GETTING HIM A CLUE
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, OF
ON OUR BEACH OR IF IT WAS
GETTING HIM TO TALK.
WE HAVE NO IDEA.
SO IT DEFINITELY STIRRED STUFF
UP.
 Jeff: JEREMIAH, WHAT'S YOUR
VERSION OF THE STORY?
 THEY GAVE ME A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY CLUE AND THAT PUT A
MAJOR TARGET ON MY BACK BECAUSE
IT CAUSED EVERYTHING TO GO, WOW,
THEY JUST GAVE JEREMIAH A CLUE,
PULLED HIM TO THE SIDE AND WENT
AND TALKED TO HIM BUT I SAW
RIGHT THROUGH THAT.
I HOPE THEY BELIEVE ME.
 Jeff: ALEXIS, WHILE
JEREMIAH IS TALKING YOU APPEAR
TO BE THINKING I DO TRUST HIM?
THIS IS ABOUT TRUST, ISN'T IT?
 IT'S 100% ABOUT TRUST.
THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT'S VOTE IS
ON, AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE
UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAPPENED.
HE THINKS IT WAS THEIR WAY OF
TARGETING HIM, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT THEIR GOAL WAS.
 BUT, JEFF, I THINK THE
POSSIBILITY THAT WHEN WE MERGE
JEREMIAH OR ALEXIS COULD FLIP
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.
 Jeff: TASHA, YOU ARE
LEANING IN LIKE YOU CAN'T GET
ENOUGH OF IT.
 IT'S VERY TELLING, JEFF.
BOTH JEREMIAH AND ALEXIS COULD
FLIP AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK ONE
IS A MORE VIABLE OPTION, HERE
COMES A SECOND ONE THAT MAKES
YOU SECOND GUESS.
 Jeff: SARA, YOU'RE IN THE
MIDDLE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THIS?
 ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
IT OFF OF ME RIGHT NOW, I'M GOOD
WITH.
I'M SOLID WITH THIS TRIBE.
BUT THERE IS ONE PERSON HERE
THAT WILL GO TO THE OTHER SIDE.
 Jeff: ALEXIS, NOW THIS TIME
YOU'RE NODDING AFFIRMATIVELY
LIKE I AGREE.
 I AGREE, I DO.
THE WAY I SEE IT, IS THE THREE
OF US ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT
HAVE CONNECTIONS ON THE OTHER
SIDE BUT ONLY TWO OF OUR WORDS
MEAN SOMETHING BECAUSE WE NEVER
WENT BACK ON IT ONCE.
 Jeff: MEANING YOU AND
SARAH.
 YES.
 Jeff: SPENCER, HOW BIG A
VOTE IS IT TONIGHT?
 IF WE ARE MAKING THE WRONG
MOVE WE ARE 11th, TENTH,
NINTH, EIGHTH AND SEVENTH PLACE.
IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT DECISION WE'VE MADE SO
FAR.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
KASS, YOU'RE UP.
 IT ONLY TAKES ONE LIE TO LOSE
MY TRUST AND YOU'VE LIED, LIKE,
100 TIMES.
 YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOING
TO FLIP.
 THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FLIP SO YOU
HAVE TO GO.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES ARE
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, JEREMIAH.
ALEXIS.
ALEXIS.
TWO VOTES ALEXIS, ONE VOTE
JEREMIAH.
ALEXIS.
THAT'S THREE VOTES ALEXIS, ONE
VOTE JEREMIAH.
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: CAGAYAN," THAT'S
FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH.
ALEXIS, YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.
( CRYING )
 Jeff: A COUPLE OF THINGS
CLEAR FROM TONIGHT'S VOTE.
IT WAS A BIG VOTE, AND YOU WERE
UNIFIED IN YOUR DECISION TO VOTE
OUT ALEXIS.
THE LINGERING QUESTION AS YOU
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, HOW DEEP DOES
THAT UNITY RUN?
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":
 I THINK SOMETHING'S BREWING.
 A MERGE HAS TWO ALLIANCES
FIGHTING FOR POWER.
 WHEN THOSE FIVE GET HERE,
IT'S US AGAINST THEM.
 Jeff: BUT IT'S ONE TRIBE
MEMBER WHO HOLDS ALL THE CARDS.
 THERE'S A SOLID FIVE, A SOLID
FIVE, AND ME.
I WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THIS
GAME.
 I CAME OUT HERE WANTING TO GO
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
I'M ONE OF THE BIGGEST FANS, AND
SO IT REALLY BREAKS MY HEART
THAT I CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE
MERGE.
I CAN'T EVEN GET THAT FAR.
I REALLY THOUGHT I'D DO BETTER
THAN THIS.
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
