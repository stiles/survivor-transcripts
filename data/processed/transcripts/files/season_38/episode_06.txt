"Survivor" has just given me.
Much to this game, and im
I got played hard.
Im proud to stand with these.
You, jeff, and everyone here,
Have grown up without.
Sand on the beach, you guys are.
Not a lot of people have.
Chris, what was the.
Extinction?
When I came out here, I.
Game, and to have that slip.
Embrace that and understand,
Youre going to screw up.
But being out there with these.
You didnt have to fake.
You could just be yourself, and.

To make.
For the love of god.
Who wants to go back.
Another shot back in this game?
Lets do it!
Everybody going back.
Grab your stuff, head back to.
Your adventure continues.
Were back, were back, were
when you think youve gone.
Much lower, the lower you go,
When jeff said that we could.
Down like a child on christmas.
Were still in.
Im not out of it.
I am still playing "Survivor."
my god.
You look so good.
We arrived at the merge, and.
Of excitement and joy.
We are going into this with all.
Together some we have eight.
Were going to have the.
Thats an incredible feeling.
How was distinction island?
Its purgatory.
The twist is right on your buff.
You get a torch, theres map,
The one person I thought,
Like why are you back here now?
I dont want him back here.
How are you with the dad bod
dad bod is back in the game.
Im back, baby.
Im back in the game.
But there is definitely a fear.
Out because you just came back.
Maybe they resent it.
Maybe its just easy.
So I need to make a human.
Dont write me off as the easy.
Before they get to know me.
I dont know how you feel in.
Didnt know...
So as much as I love them, im a
the minute I start speaking.
Knew that I really liked him,
Person, just the fact that he.
Able to win a spot back into.
Him.
I would never want to see him go.
So quickly.
I mean, it sounds like a scary.
To.
To.
I new that coming ban was
I needed.
Other people, though, we get.
Buyers remorse.
Their journey is out of this
after I lost, I honestly felt
and then there was three.
Then there was three.
I dont think anyone has had.
Everything that could have gone.
End of the day, I feel so proud.
Most important for me.
How crazy.
The edge of extinction will.
The weak arent going to.
Crumbling around me, I know just.
Im going to get my butt back in
im working with lauren.
We have two idols.
Thats a lot of power.
We can do a lot with that if
we need to find a crack.
The problem is im in this.
Im going to need every tool.
That im in.
So I, 000% have to have a talk
how are you feeling about.
I feel like were... I feel
here I am again with joe.
Here he is again in the majority.
I feel like im at his mercy.
Why?
This is an absolute nightmare.
Well see how welke pitch him.
This is a sales pitch for me.
I dont know how you feel act.
Thing.
I dont like it.
I dont trust most of my kamas.
Together, but me and aubry were
Aurora was on the outs.
I feel like im on the bottom.
Its a weird state of limbo.
I definitely see david and
I see them shifting to that.
That will try to take you out.
Im not coming for you, joe.
Im not coming for you.
I need you here, too.
I definitely feel like joe.
Still trying to decipher, figure.
So I think the best plan is to.
Out rick.
So now we have all the girls.
What is this six girl, seven.
What are you thinking?
Whats the ideal?
Im open to hearing all.
We want to get through a safe.
And ricks name kind of popped.
He could be an easy vote that.
With.
That doesnt cross too many.
I am shocked kelley and.
First and send him right back to.
Just from a moral standpoint,
Possibly do that to somebody to.
They came after facing the odds.
I dont think ricks bad.
I dont think it pisses anyone.
I think we get rid of devens,
Ill do it.
Kelley and lauren seem so.
Maybe one of them should be sent.
Extinction.
Thats a lot of pieces that
thats good right there.
You guys need a hand?
Not really.
When I got back to camp, I.
Little something there.
Is sitting in my bag.
And so I practically run down.
Trail, I unwrap it, and... Holy.
And its this beauty.
Two pieces with a note.
"Congratulations."
You have earned your way back.
Staying in may not be as easy.
"This may help."
You must give one half of this.
If youre both still in the game.
These two pieces when used.
Full power.
So its an immunity idol.
I cant use it this time.
I keep half of it.
I give the other half to another.
This may be the only bar.
In the game.
This idol has no power until.
Holy crap.
But its tricky because I cant.
So I have to do what I have to.
I have something to tell.
I have an immunity idol.
Are you serious?
Yeah, but I have to
okay.
Before the tribal.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.
Davids the one I can trust.
Like if I have to work this idol.
Share it with my closest ally.
So obviously im planning on.
If either of us gets voted out,
for the first vote, its not.
Its just a bargaining chip.
I feel like I might be on the.
So im scared to death going.
So im scared to death going.
Come on in, guys.
All right.

The merge, so I might have to.
Tonight, but the fact that ill.
Necklace, theres no blindsides.
Thats like the most comfortable

As a returning player, she needs.
These are the kinds of things I.
Orchestrateing.

Everyone on your tribe is.
Thinks you should go right back.
Theres in way in hell I would.

This game moves fast, so a.
People get together and want the
joe made a mistake.
Joe, who do I voted for, whats.
He was very vague.
It did not make me feel good.
Joe is brushing me aside.
Right now I dont know that I.
What he doesnt know is my true
Julie, julia, gavin, and.
So im thinking joe losing is a.
Youre playing "Survivor" and.
Every time is the right time.
And so ive got to convince the
there they are.
Guys, theyre here.
Theres one, two, right here.
He doesnt have an idol.
Hes not expecting it.
Just the six?
What do you mean?
Focus on that one.
Focus on that one.
Go slow, guys.
Dang.
We might have lost him for
round one goes to the
ron wants to do joe, because.
Now is the time to get rid of
I would rather go the safer.
But its definitely important to.
Its
I already talked to julia.
Okay.
Where are you?
Id a go kelley.
Kelley?
Kelley.
Theres a lot of different
Joe being one of them.
Ive heard ricks name thrown.
Ive heard kelley wentworths.
Theres three very good options.
We need to figure out which one
lets check in.
Im pretty sure were all on the
I think we have to take a shot
too soon to get rid of joe.
Listen, I can see the.
Kelley.
It can go a million different.
Of us have to come to a
there is not a general.
Voted out, because all of us can.
Kelley or joe should be voted.
Good cases.
It is really important to make.
Very first vote right at the.
The game.
If you dont yet have.
Well now bring in the members
whats happening?
Boy.
Reem, chris, and.
All right.
Julie, what was the feeling with.
Merging?

New supreme, peek speak to them,
We havent been able to before
Ron, you had a.
I love kama.
Everyone knows this.
I didnt want to swap.
I look down and saw the yellow.
Then I look down and saw a bunch.
Im like, this is awesome.
Wentworth, are you.
Hear ron say hes glad kama
im in the minority.
It doesnt make me super.
Days a lot of new relationships
I dont know its so cut and.
One of the other big.
You earned your way back into
all right I dont know the.
Plus I havent met anyone on the.
I spent all my time in.
Was there any talk to.
Voted him out once?
Absolutely not.
To send imright back, there.
Opinion.
Why would we get rid of somebody.
Into the merge?
I just think there are bigger
Joe, what do you read
victoria said there are.
As a stronger player, that
I now have to have many I little.
I dont think I said physical.
Because there are other kinds of.
There are strategic threats in.
Did I take it the wrong way.
Me then it was accurate?
There are other things that.
The clear up what I meant.
Ron, what about.
Anyone has one.
No one is mentioning it.
It seems like they dont exist.
Every season you feel that.
Idols pop up in the same tribal.
So if there are some idols out.
That information.
Devon, what was the.
Was it casual?
Was it frenetic.
Did paranoia kick?
When it came to strategy,
Theyre going after.
Joe didnt do anything today.
He just painted.
Are you that comfortable that.
Anybody, or are you that scared.
Anybody.
It was weird.
What was it, joe?
I know where I stand with
I home that kama strong does.
Im relying on those past.
This evening.
Jeff, when you have the.
Scramble so much.
We were relaxed because we knew.
We didnt need to scramble.
Wow.
Wentworth, thats so frustrating
you kind of chuckle, because.
Said, that but if youre me,
So...

Prepare for a crash.
Medical!
My god.
Can you hear me?
The one thing I feared.

The theme of the merge flag.
You got to die to be born again.
Thats exactly what im going to
