         Jeff: IT'S THE "SURVIVOR:
EDGE OF EXTINCTION" REUNION SHOW
WHERE CHRIS HAS JUST WON $1
MILLION.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I KNOW IT'S STILL SINNING IN.
I WANT TO GET RIGHT INTO IT.
THE TWO BIG MOVES REALLY
CENTERED AROUND DEVENS, HONORING
THE LOYALTY, WHICH KEPT YOU IN
IT AND GAVE YOU A FIGHTING SHOT,
WHICH YOU JUST HEARD HIM TALK
ABOUT EARLIER, AND THEN YOU
SAYING, THIS IS MY GAME, AND I
GOT TO PLAY MY GAME.
IS THERE, WHEN YOU WATCH THAT
BACK, KNOWING WHAT YOU MADE IS A
LEGIT MOVE, EVEN DEVENS SAID SO,
IT'S GOOD GAME PLAY, IS THERE








ANY "SURVIVOR" GUILT?
DOES IT HAUNT YOU AT ALL THIS IT
TOOK THAT TO DO THAT TO DEVENS
TO PUT YOURSELF IN THAT SPOT?
 WELL, IT WAS -- I DON'T THINK
THERE WAS ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND.
I KNEW I HAD TO DO THAT.
SO FROM A GAME PLAY STANDPOINT,
THERE WAS NO GUILT.
I KNOW THAT ALL THESE PLAYERS,
THEY'RE SO GOOD.
IF THEY WERE IN MY SITUATION,
THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING.
DEVENS WAS SUCH A GOOD PLAYER.
I TOLD HIM, TOO, I SAID, DUDE,
IF YOU WIN, YOU GOT MY VOTE.
SO IT WAS JUST MATTER OF WHO
WOULD COME OUT ON TOP.
 Jeff: SO ARE YOU GUYS GOOD?
ARE YOU FRIENDS?








 IF HE HADN'T WON A MILLION
DOLLARS, IT WOULD BE UP IN THE
AIR, BUT, YEAH, NOW WE'RE
FRIENDS, ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: WELL, HE'S A GOOD
DUDE.
 Jeff: ONE RELATIONSHIP THAT
REMAINED LOYAL THROUGHOUT WAS
DEVENS AND DAVID.
DAVID, YOU WERE ALWAYS GREAT.
I GOT TO THANK YOU FOR THE
ANALOGY, BECAUSE LIKE THE PILOT
AND THE PASSENGER, THOSE THINGS
ARE SO HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY MAKE
THE SHOW RELATABLE IN A
DIFFERENT WAY.
YOU CAN ATTACH A MEANING TO IT.
SO GIVE ME ONE NOW, HAVING SPENT
TIME ON EXTINCTION AND HAVING
HAD THE CHANCE TO GO HOME,
WHAT -- DO YOU HAVE ANY
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS THAT FOR
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T IMAGINE HOW
THAT'S EVEN WORSE THAN
"SURVIVOR."
 YOU KNOW, I GUESS IT WOULD BE
LIKE IF YOU SHOWED UP AT A
RESTAURANT THAT WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF FOOD, AND YOU STILL
WALKED OUT WITH A COMPLETELY
FULL BELLY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF TIP
YOU WOULD LEAVE, BUT IT WAS AN
UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE BEING
OUT THERE.
 Jeff: AND I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE GENUINELY HAVE WATCHED
YOU MATURE.
 YEAH, YOU HAVE.
OH, GOD.
YEAH, YEAH.
QUITE LIKE A BABY.
YEAH, NO, YOU HAVE.
 Jeff: EVEN DOWN TO HAVING A
RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU TALKED
ABOUT.
 OH, DAVID.
 I'M SORRY.
BUT I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
YOU TALKED TO HER.
SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE.
I PROVED IN WITH HER, AND
IT'S -- IT'S AWESOME TO SEE.
IT REALLY IS.
 Jeff: BY THE WAY, A QUICK
UPDATE, DAVID IS NOW WRITING ON
A SHOW FOR CBS, "STAR TREK," AND
COCHRAN IS WRITING ON IT WITH
HIM, WHICH HAS GOT TO BE THE
CRAZIEST WRITERS' ROOM.
 IT'S INSANE.
 Jeff: WENTWORTH, KELLEY, I
NEVER SAY KELLEY.
WENTWORTH, WHAT IS IT THAT KEEPS
YOU COMING BACK?
 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.
I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS
IS I'M VERY COMPETITIVEN I'M A
VERY STRONG WOMAN.
I THINK THERE IS THIS WEIRD
DESIRE TO LIKE BE THIS POSITIVE
INFLUENCE ON A LOT OF WOMEN OUT
THERE.
AND SO I JUST WANT TO BE THIS
REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS LIKE I
WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
LY ALWAYS BE STRONG.
I CAN STILL BE EMOTIONAL AND
STILL BE A STRONG WOMAN, AND I
WILL DO IT FOR YOU.
IT SOUNDS REALLY STRANGE, BUT I
FEEL LIKE I'M REPRESENTING.
 Jeff: IT DOESN'T SOUND
STRANGE.
 I WANT PEOPLE OUT THERE,
ESPECIALLY GIRLS WHO ARE
TEENAGERS, I WANT THEM TO FEEL
LIKE THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY
WANT TO DO.
 Jeff: LOVE IT.
 YES.
 Jeff: I LOVE THAT.
AND I LOVE THAT WE GOT TO SEE
EMOTION FROM YOU, BECAUSE YOU
ACTUALLY LET US IN FOR JUST A
SECOND.
 I DON'T NORMALLY DO THAT.
BUT YOU CAN BE STRONG AND
EMOTIONAL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIT IN ANY
SORT OF BOX.
BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE.
 Jeff: WELL SAID.
JULIE, YOU WERE ACTUALLY THE
OPPOSITE.
YOU WENT... I FEEL LIKE YOU WENT
FROM SOFT TO TOUGH.
THAT WAS PART OF YOUR MISSION.
DO YOU FEEL "YOU ARE MY FRIEND"
ACCOMPLISHED IT?
YOU MADE IT TO THE END.
YOU WANTED TO SHOW YOURSELF AND
YOUR FAMILY, I'M MORE THAN WHO
YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS MOM OR THE
WIFE?
 YEAH, PLAYING THIS GAME WAS
THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER
DONE, BUT ALSO THE MOST AMAZING
THING I'VE DONE ALL AT THE SAME
TIME.
I DEFINITELY CAME ON "SURVIVOR"
TO PROVE TO PIETION AND TO MY
KIDS AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS
AT HOME THAT I CAN PUSH MYSELF
FURTHER THAN I EVER HAVE.
IN THOSE 39 DAYS, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DID.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: GAVIN, I ONLY HAVE
ONE QUESTION: YOU WERE SO
OBSESSED WITH "SURVIVOR" THAT
YOU MOVED YOUR WEDDING.
SO NOW THAT YOU HAVE MADE IT TO
THE END, GOT FOUR VOTES, THAT IS
A LIDGE LA JET "SURVIVOR"
PERFORMANCE.
IS THIS OBSESSION GONE?
CAN YOU MOVE ON NOW?
 THE OBSESSION ISN'T GONE, BUT
NOW I CAN SHUT UP TO MY PARENTS
AND MY WIFE ABOUT HOW I NEED TO
PLAY.
AND NOW I CAN FOCUS ON -- AND I
DIDN'T WIN -- BUT IN MY MIND,
WHENEVER I WAS LEAVING FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I KNEW I WAS A
WINNER BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE
GOING TO BE WAITING ON ME AT THE
AIRPORT.
SO NO MATTER WHAT, I LEARNED SO
MUCH FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.
 Jeff: I WANT THE SHARE
SOMETHING, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
BEING BACKSTAGE IS EVEN CRAZIER
THAN THE FINALE YOU'RE WATCHING,
ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIEND IS
SIA.
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A SUPER FAN
WHO IS SIA, THIS GLOBAL POP
STAR.
SHE JUST LOVES "SURVIVOR."
EVERY SEASON SHE CREATED HER OWN
AWARD, THE SIA AWARD, WHICH SHE
GIVES TO THE PERSON SHE WAS MOST
ENTERTAINED BY.
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY RICK DEVON,
THE SIA AWARD GOES TO YOU?
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S AMAZING.
 Jeff: I THINK YOU COULD --
 THANK YOU, SIA!
 Jeff: IT IS A VERY NICE
AWARD.
IT IS $100,000.
AND THE REASON IS, I WANT TO BE
REALLY CLEAR, BECAUSE THIS
SOUNDS CRAZY, THIS IS THE TRUTH,
SIA SAYS, I HAVE BEEN SO LUCKY
IN MY LIFE.
I LIKE TO SHARE MY SUCCESS, AND
I GET A LOT OF ENJOYMENT FROM
THE SHOW.
THERE YOU GO.
WOW.
HOW DO WE TOP THAT?
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.
A LOT MORE TO COME, INCLUDING
WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT SEASON,
WHICH IS SUPER COOL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: "SURVIVOR" REUNION
WILL CONTINUE ONLY ON CBS.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
"SURVIVOR: EDGE OF EXTINCTION"
LIVE REUNION SHOW.
REEM, I DIDN'T KNOW, WHO KNOWS
IF WE WOULD HAVE EVEN HAD AN
EDGE OF EXTINCTION SEASON IF YOU
HAD NOT, GOING THERE FIRST, BEEN
THE ONE TO STAY.
THERE I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU
HAD A BRUTAL TRIBAL.
THEN YOU GO TO A BRUTAL FIRST
NIGHT WHERE YOUR TORCH GOES OUT.
THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN.
YOU TOOK IT ON THE CHIN.
YOU STAYED OUT THERE FOR 32
DAYS.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE.
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD AND THAT
YOUR KIDS AND YOUR FAMILY ARE AS
PROUD OF YOURSELF AS YOU ARE.
ARE THEY?
 I HOPE SO.
I THINK SO.
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO NOT DO
IT FOR A REASON IF I LEFT THEM
AND I LEFT EVERYTHING.
THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING BEHIND
IT.
SO I WASN'T GOING THE LEAVE.
I DIDN'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAID
TO ME.
AND I DIDN'T CARE HOW MISERABLE
I WAS.
I WAS NEVER EVER EVER -- SORRY.
DAMMIT.
 Jeff: I CAN GET YOU OUT OF
IT.
DUDE.
DUDE.
JUST WHATEVER, DUDE.
COME ON, TOUGHEN UP.
 IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
 Jeff: WELL, WE APPRECIATE
YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: AND WENDY, WENDY, I
HAVE TO SAY.
 HI.
 Jeff: SO MANY PEOPLE TALKED
ABOUT ONE ASPECT, NOT THE
CHICKENS, NOT THE FLINT, BUT
YOUR ABSOLUTE COMFORT IN BEING
VULNERABLE WITH YOUR TOURETTES.
HAVE YOU HAD ESPECIALLY -- HAVE
YOU HEARD FROM PEOPLE, AND EVEN
NOW AS IT'S HAPPENING, YOU JUST
CONTINUE TO SMILE THROUGH IT.
HAS THAT INSPIRED?
HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE
HELPING THEM?
 I FEEL LIKE COMING ON THE
SHOW, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASHAMED
OR EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT.
SO I'M COMPLETELY NORMAL WITH
IT.
SO DURING THAT CHALLENGE I WAS
COMPLETELY NORMAL.
BUT THEN WHEN PEOPLE STARTED
MESSAGING ME SAYING I INSPIRED
THEM, I NEVER CAME OUT HERE TO
INSPIRE ANYONE, BUT IF I COULD
DO, EVEN A SMALL PART FOR THEM
TO GAIN COURAGE THEMSELVES, I
THINK THAT'S GOOD.
 Jeff: I THINK YOU DID THAT.
 Jeff: RON.
SIMPLE QUESTION: IT'S VERY TOUGH
TO BE A TEACHER, ESPECIALLY WITH
YOUR CAREER AND YOUR REDENNIALS
AND COME ON "SURVIVOR," WHICH IS
A TOUGH GAME, AND BE BASICALLY A
VILLAIN.
WAS THERE ANY KICKBACK AT ALL OR
DID YOUR STUDENTS EMBRACE IT?
 YEAH, I TALKED TO MY STUDENTS
BEFORE THE FIRST EPISODE, AND I
SAID, IT'S A GAME WHERE YOU CAN
LIE AND MANIPULATE.
THEY SAID, YOU BETTER LIE.
YOU BETTER WIN THAT GAME.
I TELL THEM TO GO FOR IT IN
LIFE.
DREAM BIG.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING,
DO IT.
I WASN'T NECESSARILY TRYING TO
BE A VILLAIN.
I WAS TRYING THE PLAY HARD.
I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY.
 Jeff: YOU DID.
WE APPRECIATED YOU BEING OUT
THERE.
JULIA, FOR ME THERE WERE SO MANY
MOVING STORIES, EVEN HONESTLY AS
I WAS WATCHING THE SHOW
BACKSTAGE WHEN YOU ALL TOLD YOUR
STORIES AT THE END OF
EXTINCTION, BUT YOURS REALLY
CONNECTED BECAUSE FINDING THAT
PIECE WITH YOUR DAD IS SOMETHING
YOU COULDN'T HAVE ANTICIPATED
HAPPENING.
 NEVER.
 Jeff: AND NOW THAT YOU'RE
HOPE AND YOU'VE SEEN IT, IS
THERE -- BECAUSE "SURVIVOR" WAS
KIND OF FULL CIRCLE.
YOU WATCHED TO GET OVER HIM, AND
THEN YOU PLAYED AND IT HELPED
YOU HEAL HIM.
 ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY AND THE EDGE
OF EXTINCTION, THAT'S THE LAST
THING I WOULD HAVE EVER EXPECTED
TO COME OF COMING ON "SURVIVOR."
AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME MY EDGE
OF EXTINCTION EXPERIENCE BROUGHT
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER WOULD
HAVE EXPECTED FROM PLAYING.
THAT WAS INTERNAL PEACE AND, YOU
KNOW, RECOGNIZING MY OWN
STRENGTHS AND BRINGING THAT WITH
ME IN LIFE.
WHILE THERE MIGHT ONLY BE ONE
SOLE SURVIVOR THIS SEASON, THERE
CAN BE MULTIPLE WIN VERSE YOU
FIND VALUE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE.
I ABSOLUTELY FOUND THE VALUE IN
MY EXPERIENCE.
 Jeff: BEAUTIFUL.
THERE WERE SO MANY STORIES.
I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME.
THE SEASON WAS SO GOOD.
AUBRY, YOU WERE ALWAYS AWESOME
WHEN YOU LET US IN AND LET US
SEE YOU GROW.
LAUREN, YOU PUSHED YOUR BODY SO
HARD, YOU PULLED A JOE.
YOU ACTUALLY PASSED OUT.
 JOE PROBABLY LOOKED BETTER
DOING IT.
 Jeff: I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HIT PRETTY HARD.
VICTORIA, HERE'S THE THING MOST
PEOPLE SAID, SHE'S SO STEALTH.
WE SOMETIMES FORGET SHE'S IN THE
GAME.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE ON THAT
BEACH, AND EVEN I MISSED YOU
SOMETIMES IN CHALLENGES.
AND WARDOG, YOU'RE ONE OF THE
MOST UNORTHODOX PLAYERS, BUT YOU
DOVE SO MANY STORIES.
AND ALSO, AURORA, AND I KNOW I'M
DOING THE SPEECH, BUT AURORA, I
WANT TO SAY THAT I SAW YOU OUT
THERE.
AND I FELT LIKE YOU STRUGGLED
THE ENTIRE TIME TO FIND A BOND,
AND YOU TOLD US WHY.
YOU TOLD US.
IT'S MY STORY.
IT'S WHO I AM.
IT'S WHY WHEN LAUREN FALLS, I
CAN LOOK FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO
STEP OVER THE BODY, BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW IT IS.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW
MANY PEOPLE WERE PROVED BY THAT
AND CONNECTED BY YOUR STORY, AS
WELL.
SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK, AFTER ONE
GREAT SEASON ON EDGE, WE HAVE
ANOTHER SEASON COMING UP.
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING
NEXT RIGHT AFTER THIS.
 Jeff: "SURVIVOR REUNION"
WILL CONTINUE ONLY ON CBS.
 OH, MY GOD.
 KELLEY, YOU LOOK SKINNIER.
 Jeff: THAT WAS THE MOMENT
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION ARRIVED
AT PONDEROSA AND SAW WHAT THEY
LOOKED LIKE.
THAT SERIES IS WORTH CHECKING
OUT.
AS THIS SEASON COMES TO AN END,
I'M HAPPY TO SAY, ONCE AGAIN,
THERE IS A NEW ONE JUST AROUND
THE BEND.
TAKE A LOOK.
FOR OUR 39th SEASON, TWO
LEGENDARY WINNERS RETURN TO THE
GAME.
 BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE'VE
PLAYED OVER 200 DAYS.
WE'VE BOTH WON THE GAME.
SANDRA IS THE ONLY CONTESTANT TO
EVER WIN TWICE.
WE KNOW THREFERG IS TO KNOW
ABOUT SURVIVOR.
I WROTE A BOOK ON IT.
 Jeff: BUT FOR THE FIRST
TIME EVER, THEY WON'T BE
COMPETING FOR THE $1 MILLION
PRIZE.
INSTEAD THEY'LL LIVE TOGETHER ON
THEIR OWN ISLAND AND SERVE AS
MENTORS TO A GROUP OF NEW
PLAYERS.
 IF THEY COULD TAKE WHAT ROB
CAN TEACH THEM AND WHAT I CAN
TEACH THEM AND PUT IT ALL
TOGETHER, THEY CAN TAKE HOME THE
ALL THEY GOT TO DO IS LISTEN.
 Jeff: IT'S A "SURVIVOR"
BOOTCAMP WHERE EVERY VISIT IS A
DANCE WITH DANGER.
 WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU ANYTHING
FOR FREE.
 "SURVIVOR" SCHOOL IS IN
SESSION.
 Jeff: COMING THIS FALL,
"SURVIVOR" ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.
SURVEILLANCE'S VERSION OF MOUNT
RUSHMORE.
MORE REUNION COMING UP.
 Jeff: IF YOU WANT TO BID ON
PROMISE FROM THIS SEASON OF
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AND
CONTINUING TO BE LOYAL.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN IF FALL FOR
"SURVIVOR: ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."
NICE JOB, EVERYBODY.
