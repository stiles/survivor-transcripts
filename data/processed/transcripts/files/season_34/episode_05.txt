 --- 

         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE TAVUA TRIBE,
TROYZAN WAS IN THE MINORITY.
 I'M SURE TROYZAN FEELS LIKE
HE'S ON THE OUTS BECAUSE HE IS.
 Jeff: AT THE MANA TRIBE,
TAI FOUND A CLUE TO AN IDOL.
 OH, MY GOD.
YOU WILL NEED TO SOAK A WOODEN
BOARD.
 Jeff: AND DEBBIE LOST HER
MIND.
 I WAS LOYAL TO YOU
COMPLETELY, AND YOU CRUSHED MY
HEART!
IT'S FRUSTRATING, AND I'M
PISSED!
 Jeff: AT THE NUKU TRIBE,
AUBRY AND J.T. TRIED TO RALLY








THE TROOPS.
 IT'S BETTER NOT TO HAVE
MICHAELA.
 Jeff: BUT SANDRA WAS
LEADING THE CHARGE.
 BETWEEN ME, YOU, AND
MICHAELA, WE CAN TAKE OUT J.T.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SANDRA GOT HER WAY, AGAIN.
J.T., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 DREW: AND AUBRY WAS LEFT IN
THE DARK.
15 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT?
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 NICE MOVE, GUYS.
NICE MOVE TO PLAY.
I'M IMPRESSED.
I REALLY AM.








I WENT INTO TRIBAL THINKING
MICHAELA WAS GOING TO GO HOME,
AND THEY VOTED OUT J.T.
I'M CONSTANTLY ON THE BOTTOM,
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN TRYING
REALLY HARD TO BUILD
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE PEOPLE,
BUT THEN IT ALL BLOWS UP IN MY
FACE.
WHY DID YOU GUYS CHOOSE THE KEEP
ME OVER HIM?
 IT WAS ABOUT THE BETRAYAL.
WHEN MALCOLM WENT HOME, I TOOK
IT REALLY, REALLY HARD.
WE LOST MAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIM.
HE HAD TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR WHAT HE DID.
 CLEARLY SANDRA IS RUNNING THE
SHOW.
AND I FEEL LIKE SHE'S CUTTING MY
LEGS OUT FROM UNDER ME LICK A
SLOW DEATH.
THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A PLAY.
WITHOUT A DOUBT SANDRA IS THE
BEST PLAYER HERE.
SHE IS THE QUEEN OF THIS GAME,
AND I NEED TO LEARN A THING OR
TWO FROM HER.
 I FOUND A CLUE EARLIER.
THE CLUE SAID GO LOOK FOR SOME
BOARD.
I TORE MY BRAIN, AND I WAS
THINKING, IN THE WATERWELL IS
WHERE THE BOARD WOULD BE.
SO I GOT THE MAKE THE MOVE.
I GOT TO GET THIS IDOL, BUT I
NEED TO MAKE IT QUICK BEFORE
EVERYBODY WAKES UP.
THE CLUE SAYS WET THE BOARD.
WHEN YOU FIT A BOARD WITH A
SYMBOL, DIG UNDERNEATH THAT.
THE IDOL IS THERE.
THE LAST BOARD, THERE IT COME,
IT'S BRIGHT WHITE, A SIMILAR --
SYMBOL OF AN ANCHOR.
THAT IS SO COOL.
I'M THE LUCKIEST GAY.
I FOUND THE IDOL, THE SECOND,
WITHIN THREE DAYS.
LAST TIME I FOUND AN IDOL, I
CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF THE
GAME, MALCOLM WENT HOME.
IT SHIFTED THE POWER.
THIS ONE I DON'T SEE ME USING IT
ANY TIME SOON.
WE'LL SEE.
I'M PLAYING THE GAME NOW.
I'M THE GAME CHANGER, AND I
COULDN'T BE ANY HAPPIER.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
MANA AN TAVUA GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW NUKU TRIBE.
J.T. VOTED OUT AT LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 WOW.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
GLAD TO SEE BOTH TRIBES BROUGHT
YOUR IMMUNITY IDOLS.
I'LL TAKE THEM BACK.
THANK YOU.
 YOU GOT IT.
 WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 WHAT'S ON THE TABLE, JEFF?
 Jeff: NICE TO HAVE THESE
BACK, ALTHOUGH WE WON'T BE
NEEDING THEM TODAY.
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.
WE'RE SWITCHING THINGS UP AGAIN.
 YAY!
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GET TO IT?
 YEAH.
 LET'S DO IT.
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: DON'T OPEN IT.
GRAB ONE.
 WHAT A CRAZY GAME.
 OH, MY GOD, JEFF.
 WHICH ONE IS A GOOD ONE?
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GOING
TO GET STUCK WITH EVERYTHING NO
ONE ELSE WANTED.
 I'M SCARED.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY REVEAL YOUR BUFFS.
IF YOU HAVE ORANGE, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE MANA MAT.
IF YOU HAVE BLUE, TAKE A SPOT ON
THE NUKU MAT.
 .
..
 DEBBIE.
 DEBBIE DOES NOT HAVE A BUFF
BECAUSE DEBBIE IS WITHOUT A
TRIBE.
DEBBIE, TAKE A SPOT IN THE
MIDDLE.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.
 NICE TO MEET YOU, BUDDY.
 I'M CIRIE.
NICE THE MEET YOU.
SO LOTS OF CELEBRATING ON BOTH
ENDS.
THE NEW MANA TRIBE, TROYZAN,
MICHAELA, SIERRA, HALI, AUBRY,
CIRIE AND CULPEPPER.
THE NEW NUKU TRIBE, SANDRA,
SARAH, VARNER, ANDREA, TAI,
ZEKE, AND OZZY.
THE GAME TURNS SO QUICKLY.
SANDRA AND VARNER NOW IN THE
MINORITY SPOT.
SANDRA, YOU'RE IN THE BACK ROW,
HANDS ARE IN YOUR POCKET, YOU'RE
NOT SAYING MUCH.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, SANDRA?
 I'M OPTIMISTIC.
I HOPE THEY GET TO MEET ME FIRST
BEFORE THEY DECIDE IF SOMETHING
GOES LEFT THAT I END UP RIGHT.
 Jeff: STUCK IN THE MIDDLE
WITHOUT A HOME IS DEBBIE.
LET ME CATCH YOU UP.
YOU ARE GOING NOWHERE EXCEPT TO
EXILE ISLAND.
YOU WILL LEAVE HERE AND HEAD TO
EXILE ISLAND WHERE YOU WILL LIVE
ALONE.
YOU'LL RETURN TO THE GAME AT THE
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE YOU
WILL JOIN THE TRIBE THAT LOSES A
MEMBER.
THE GOOD NEWS IS OBVIOUS: YOU
CAN'T BE VOTED OUT AT THE NEXT
TRIBAL.
THE BAD NEWS IS EQUALLY OBVIOUS:
YOU CANNOT BOND WITH ANYBODY.
 THAT SUCKS.
 Jeff: WHAT IS GOING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW?
WHERE ARE YOU FOCUSING YOUR
THOUGHTS?
 AS A YOUTH I WENT OFF ON MY
OWN A LOT WITH A PONY.
I'M SURE THERE'S NOT A PENNY ON
EXILE ISLAND, BUT I'LL BE OKAY
ALONE, AND I'LL BE OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT WHO I WINE -- WOOPPED UP
WITH.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DEBBIE,
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD DOWN TO
THE WATER.
THE BOAT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
THE TAKE YOU THE EXILE ISLAND.
ALL RIGHT.
MANA, NUKU, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
THE GAME HAS CHANGED AGAIN.
 I WENT FROM THE TOP TO THE
BOTTOM IN LAKE A NEW YORK
MINUTE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED,
BUT I'M GOING TO CHARGE IN
HEAD-FIRST.
I'M NOT SCARED OF IT, BUT I HAVE
TO GET PAST P.T.S.D. FIRST.
 WELCOME BACK HOME.

 YEAH, WELCOME.
 WELCOME BACK.
 IT STILL LAX GOOD.
 NICE THE MEET YOU, LADIES.
 LET'S DO IT.
 WHEN JEFF SAID, "DROP THE
BUFFS," I WAS LIKE, OKAY, THIS
HAS TO BE SOME GOOD LUCK IN MY
WAY.
BEING 5-1 ON TAVUA WAS TOUGH,
EVEN THOUGH I'VE GOT AN IDOL AND
I'VE BEEN SWEATING BULLETS ALL
THOSE DAYS.
SO I THOUGHT ANYTHING THAT
HAPPENS NOW COULD BE GOOD.
 WE'VE BEEN LIVING OFF
COCONUT, BUT IT WILL GET YOU
THROUGH THE DAY.
 THAT'S IT, JUST COCONUTS?
 JEFF HAS THROWN US SOME
CURVEBALLS.
I END UP ON A TRIBE WITH PEOPLE
I DO NOT KNOW.
WHILE I WAS ON THE SAME TRIBE
WITH HALI, WE WEREN'T TIGHT.
I NEVER HAD A CONNECTION WITH
CIRIE.
TROYZAN PLAYED WITH MY WIFE
MONOCAMP HE'S ALSO A MAN AND I'M
A MAN.
WE'RE THE ONLY TWO MEN ON THE
TRIBE.
 HEY, TROY, WHAT'S YOUR TRUE
ASSESSMENT?
 I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE I'M IN THIS GAME BY
MYSELF.
 IN, YOU'RE NOT.
I'VE BEEN WITH SIERRA THE
INTERTIME.
SO I'M IN, BUDDY.
YOU JUST GOT TO STICK WITH US.
 BRAD SEEMS LIKE A REALLY UP
AND UP GUY, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE
WE'RE CONNECTED BECAUSE WE'RE
JUST TWO GUYS ON A TRIBE WITH
FIVE WOMEN.
THIS TAKES ME RIGHT BACK TO MY
SEASON OF ONE RULE.
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS
GET BAMBOOZLED BY WOMEN AGAIN.
 I'M TELLING YOU, DO NOT BE
NERVOUS WITH ME.
 ME EITHER.
ME EITHER.
 OKAY.
COME ON.
DO IT.
 I DEFINITELY THINK TROY IS AN
ALLY FOR ME GOING FORWARD.
I FEEL GOOD WITH SIERRA.
I FEEL GOOD WITH TROY.
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THREE.
I NEED A MAJORITY OF FOUR.
SO I'VE GOT SOME MORE WORK TO
DO.
 YOU GUESS STILL HAVE COFFEE
LEFT?
 YEAH, BUT JUST COFFEE.
 HOW MANY CHICKENS LEFT?
 JUST THREE.
 WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
 I GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA CITY.
I LIVE IN BROOKLYN NOW.
 I USED TO LIVE IN MANHATTAN.
 SANDRA AND I ARE ON THE OUTS
HERE.
ANDREA, ZEKE, SARAH AND OZZY
WERE ALL ON TAVUA TOGETHER, AND
TAI WAS ON THE OLD NUKU WITH
THEM.
YOU CAN JUST SEE THEY'RE
TOGETHER.
 IT'S SO WEIRD TO BE ON THE
BOTTOM ALL OF A SUDDEN, ISN'T
IT?
 I'M REALLY SCARED.
ME AND VARNER, WE'RE IN A BAD
SPOT.
BUT WHEN I COME INTO A SITUATION
WHERE I'M OUTNUMBERED, I'M JUST
CALM AND COLLECTED, BECAUSE ONCE
I GET MY FEET WET, GIVE ME A DAY
OR TWO, AND I'LL BE RUNNING THE
SHOW OVER HERE, TOO.
THE QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.
 SO I'M THINKING, I WANT
SANDRA OUT OF HERE.
 ME, TOO.
 SHE SCARES ME TO DEATH.
 WE HAVE TO GET SANDRA OUT OF
THE GAME BEFORE WE HIT THE
MERGE.
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY YOU CAN GET
SANDRA OUT OF THIS GAME ANY
TIME, EVERYONE WHO HAS SAID THAT
HAVE LOST A MILLION DOLLARS TO
SANDRA DIAZ.
 HOW DO YOU WANT THE PLAY
SANDRA AND VARNER.
 WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM THINK
THEY'RE SAFE.
 IF ANYTHING WE WE HAVE THE BL
SIDE THEM FOR SURE IN CASE THERE
IS AN IDOL.
 WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A STORY
TO TELL THEM.
YOU'RE DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE HAS EVER GOTTEN OUT
SANDRA.
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STORY TO
MAKE THEM FUEL SECURE AND BLIND
SIDE SANDRA.
 OKAY.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S...
 TAI IS THE PERFECT DECOY
BECAUSE TAI IS DANGEROUS IN THIS
GAME.
HE'S REALLY GOOD AT FINDING
IDOLS AND HE'S REALLY ?EAKY.
HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT
MAKES ME NERVOUS WORKING WITH
SOMEONE LIKE THAT, SO EVEN NO
WE'RE ACTUALLY TARGETING SANDRA,
IT WOULD SEEM LIKE IT WOULD MAKE
SENSE TO GET RID OF TAI.
 SANDRA SCARES THE CRAP OUT OF
ME.
 OH, SHE SCARES ME.
I THINK SHE IS THE BEST TO GO,
DON'T YOU THINK?
 YEAH.
WE'RE IN THE PRECARIOUS
POSITION.
ON THE ONE HAND, TAI IS THE NAME
WE'RE GIVING SANDRA AND VARNER
SO SANDRA BELIEVES SHE'S SAFE,
HOWEVER, IF TAI WAS THE FIND OUT
THAT WE THREW HIS NAME OUT
THERE, IT COULD VERY WELL BLOW
UP IN OUR FACES, BECAUSE TAI IS
KNOWN FOR FLIPPING, SO IT'S
TRICKY.
 IF WE HAVE A MERGE, I DON'T
WANT THE DEAL WITH HER, IF SHE'S
GONE, I'M HAPPY.
IN THE PAST I FOUND AN IDOL AND
FLIP-FLOPPED.
I WAS WORRIED.
I THINK I'M THE DANGEROUS ONE.
THEY SAY THE PLAN IS TO GET
SANDRA OUT, BUT THERE IS ALWAYS
A CHANCE THEY MIGHT BLIND SIDE
ME AND GET ME OUT FIRST, SO I
WANT THAT IDOL IN CASE I'M THE
TARGET.
I FOUND AN IDOL AT MANA TRIBE.
SO OKAY, I WE HAVE THE SAME
CLUES.
IT MIGHT WORK HERE.
HOLY COW.
I KNOW FOR SURE IT'S AN IDOL.
I DIDN'T EVEN OPEN IT.
"SURVIVOR" GODS REALLY LOOKED
AFTER ME THIS SEASON.
HAVING TWO IDOLS IS TREMENDOUS
POWER.
LOTS OF FLEXIBILITY.
THAT'S CRAZY.
COME ON, CHICKEN, CHICKEN.
WITH TWO IDOLS I AM ACTUALLY
MORE PARANOID.
ALL THE DIFFERENT LAYERS, THE
COMPLEXITY, THE OPTIONS.
CHICKEN, CHICKEN.
I'M REALLY, REALLY NERVOUS.
WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?
 TODAY WAS A LOW POINT FOR ME.
JEFF TELLS ME, DEBBIE, YOU'RE
GOING THE EXILE.
I COULD NOT BE IN A WORSE
POSITION ROOTING NOW.
I'M GOING TO BE EXILED ON A SHIP
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
WELCOME TO EXILE.
EXILE IS NOT SOME HELLHOLE WHERE
I HAVE TO FREEZE TONIGHT AND
STARVE.
IT'S A GORGEOUS YACHT, AND I GOT
IT MADE.
I'M THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
OH, MY GOOD LORD.
THANK YOU!
ENJOY YOUR STAY ON EXILE.
I WILL.
THIS BOAT IS FULLY STOCKED WITH
MEAT, SALAD, SNACK, SOFT DRINK,
ALCOHOL, WINE, AND DESSERT.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
NOBODY SAW THIS ONE COMING.
TOTALLY UNEXPECTED.
GAME CHANGER IN MY FAVOR.
OH, MY GOD.
NEVER IN THEIR WILDEST
IMAGINATION ARE THEY GOING THE
IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO ME.
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO FEEL SORRY
FOR ME BECAUSE I TOUGHED IT OUT
AND I FROZE.
YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM,
YUM.
NOBODY IS EXPECTING THAT I GOT
TREATED LIKE THE QUEEN.
I CAN DEAL WITH THIS.
OH, NO TRIBE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS A TRIBE OF DEBBIE.
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?
 OPEN IT'S OKAY IF I JOIN YOU.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ON TOP OF EXILE BEING SOMETHING
SO TOTALLY UNEXPECTED, HERE
COMES COCHRAN.
I'VE MET PRESIDENT, PRIME
MINISTERS, AND I'M NOT VERY
OFTEN AWESTRUCK, BUT TO MEET ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SURVIVOR WINNERS
WAS AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE.
I LITERALLY COULD NOT STOP
LAUGHING, SMILING, FREAKING OUT.
 I AM HERE AS PART OF YOUR
EXILE EXPERIENCE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 I'M HERE TO BE A SOUNDING
BOARD FOR YOU.
WE CAN TALK STRATEGY.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR GAME
MOVING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE
LIKE.
I THINK THERE'S VALUE TO HAVING
AN OBJECTIVE THIRD PARTY.
WHEN I SAW DEBBIE, I SAW,
PROVIDING GUIDANCE, IT'S GOING
TO BE TOUGH.
SHE CLAIMS TO BE AN EXPERT IN
EVERYTHING.
I HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME.
THIS HAS TO BE NERVE-RACKING.
 ACTUALLY IT IS NOT.
I'M FEELING EGGS EXTREMELY
SECURE.
 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IF I
WERE IN YOUR SHOE, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
THE GAME CHANGES DAY TO DAY.
 HOUR TO HOUR.
 YOU'RE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE
IN THAT HOUR-TO-HOUR CHANGE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FEARS OR ANY
RESERVATIONS ABOUT PEOPLE?
 I DON'T.
 UPON FIRST MEETING DEBBIE IT
WAS OBVIOUS THAT ONE OF HER
FATAL FLAWS IS OVERCONFIDENCE.
SHE SEEMED VERY SELF-ASSURED
THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO GO
HER WAY.
OVERCONFIDENCE AND A SENSE OF
COMFORT IS, YOU KNOW, POISONOUS
IN THIS GAME.
I DO THIS AS ME STEPPING OFF THE
COUCH INTO THE TV SCREEN, NO,
NO, NO, DON'T SAY THAT, YOU'RE
IN A GREAT POSITION.
PLEASE, NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NEVER
IN THAT GREAT OF A POSITION.
IS THERE ANY TENSION WITH
ANYBODY?
 I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BRAD
CULPEPPER.
I EXPLODED AT HIM.
IT SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.
 WATCHING THIS FIRST SEASON,
HE SEEMED LIKE A HOTHEAD.
YOU BLEW UP WITH A GUY BEFORE
YOU GOT SEPARATED FROM HIM.
NOW HE HAS ALL THE TIME IN THE
WORLD, I'M BRAD CULPEPPER.
 NOBODY CALLS ME A WEST
BANKER.
 I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT
AND TRY TO MEND FENCES MORE THAN
SAYING, HEY, DON'T BE A JERK TO
ME NEXT TIME.
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A CERTAIN
LEVEL OF SWALLOWING YOUR PRIDE
AND PANDERING TO PEOPLE'S EGOS.
THAT ITSELF WAS A STRATEGY.
THAT WILL WIN YOU THE GAME.
 I WILL TAKE THAT ADVICE.
LY.
 I AM TALKING THE A GUY WHO
HAS NOT ONLY PLAYED TWICE, HE
TOOK IT TO THE END THE SECOND
TIME.
COCHRAN WON.
I COULD SAY ANYTHING TO HIM AND
HE TRULY HAD MY BACK.
IT MIGHT JUST HAVE BEEN THE
BIGGEST BENEFIT OF THIS WHOLE
EXPERIENCE.
 AND THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE
MORE THING.
I HAVE ONE MORE GAME-CHANGING
TWIST TO PRESENT TO YOU.
 OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
 AS PART OF YOUR EXILE
EXPERIENCE.
IT'S IN THIS BAG.
I'M PRESENTING YOU WITH AN
ADVANTAGE OPTION.
 OH, MY GOD.
 OH, MY GOD.
NOW I'M SAYING OH, MY GOD.
 IT'S A REALLY HARD TWO WEEKS,
BUDDY.
COCHRAN, YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE.
 YOU'RE IN A GREAT POSITION.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.
YOU CAN BE IN THE BEST POSITION
IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, DEBBIE.
THIS CAN BE LIKE A GAME-CHANGING
MOMENT FOR YOU.
 I'M CRYING BECAUSE I'M
PUTTING ME STUFF ON YOU.
 DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BURN THESE CLOTHES WHEN I'M
OUT OF HERE.
 I'M GOING TO OFFER THIS TO
YOU.
 YOU'LL SOON BE JOINING A NEW
TRIBE.
CHOOSE THE ADVANTAGE YOU THINK
WILL HELP YOU THE MOST.
JUST WHEN I THINK THINGS CAN'T
GET ANY BETTER, I GET TO PICK
FROM THIS BOX ONE OF THREE
ADVANTAGES IN THE GAME.
FAKE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL KIT.
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT
YOUR OWN BEAUTIFUL BUT FAKE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
EXTRA VOTES, ONE EXTRA VOTE MAY
COME IN VERY HANDY.
TRIBE CHALLENGE ADVANTAGE.
YOUR NEW TRIBE WILL HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
WOW.
 THIS IS A BIG DECISION.
 I'M TAKING THE EXTRA VOTE.
 ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO WITH THE EXTRA VOTE.
 THE EXTRA VOTE IS A
CERTAINTY.
IT'S LIKE HAVING ONE COMPLETELY
RELIABLE PERSON WHO I KNOW IS
VOTING X WAY.
YOU KNOW, VOTE EARLY, VOTE
OFTEN.
IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR, PRI
PRIVILEGE, MY PLEASURE, SIR.
 IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE FOR
ME, SIR.
AN I'M JUST EXCITED TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE
ADVANTAGE, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
MIND-SET.
YOU'RE WELL POSITIONED.
IF DEBBIE ACTUALLY TAKES THE
ADVICE THAT WE DISCUSSED TO
HEART AND MOVES FORWARD WITH
THIS NEW MINDSET, I THINK SHE
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO WELL.
 ZEKE, WHEN I DREW THE
MINORITY BUFF YESTERDAY, I KIND
OF PANICKED A LITTLE BIT.
 I KNOW IT'S SCARY.
 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE PLAYED
TWICE AND YOU'VE NEVER MADE A
JURY.
THAT'S A CLOUD OVER MY SHOULDER.
 I WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO
ADMIT, I LIKE JEFF.
I LIKE HIM A LOT.
WE HAVE CONNECTED AND BONDED
QUITE A BIT, AND EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT SANDRA
AND MIND SIDE HIM, I SEE JEFF
VARNER AS A POTENTIALLY
DESPERATE PERSON WHO I THINK I
COULD TRUST AND SAVE GOING
FORWARD IN THIS GAME.
BUT FIRST, I NEED TO CONVINCE
HIM THAT TAI'S GOING GOING HOME.
 I'M AT THE BOTTOM, SO I'M
LAYING LOW AND JUST HOPING FOR
THE BEST.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ON THE
BOTTOM, VARNER.
 REALLY?
 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF I HAD
MY DRUTHERS, TAI WOULD BE GONE.
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY'S
ASS AT ALL.
 YOU DON'T KNOW HOW RELIEVED I
AM TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT?
 YEAH.
 I THINK HE'S TOO DANGEROUS
WITH IDOLS.
 WAY TOO DANGEROUS.
THE SECOND HE FADES ONE, IT'S
OVER.
 ZEKE AND I GO LAY ON THE
BEACH, AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES
ME AND SANDRA, WE'RE IN THE ON
THE BOTTOM ANYMORE.
ZEKE IS SCARED OF TAI BECAUSE HE
CAN FIND AN IDOL IN HIS SLEEP.
AND YOU GOT TO GET RID OF THAT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 I'M DOWN 1,000%.
 ALL RIGHT.
COOL.
 I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
HAPPEN AS EASILY AS IT DID.
I'M NOT SURE I TRUST IT
COMPLETELY YET, BUT TO THIS
POINT, I HAVE NO CHOICE.
 ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, MAN.
 WHAT DID YOU TALK TO ZEKE
ABOUT?
 WE BONDED.
 UH-HUH.
 AND ZEKE SAID THAT HE WANTS
TAI OUT.
HE WAS LIKE, I WANT TO GET RID
OF TAI RIGHT NOW.
SO WE'RE OKAY.
 YEAH.
 VARNER IS TELLING ME THEY
WANT THE TARGET TAI, AND AS LONG
AS IT AIN'T ME, I'LL VOTE TAI
OUT ALL DAY EVERY DAY, BUT
INSIDE I'M THINKING, IT'S NOT
ADDING UP.
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE STUPID OF
THEM NOT TO GET RID OF ME OR
VARNER.
WINNING IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
SURE THAT NOBODY IS FILLING OUR
HEADS WITH A PILE OF [BLEEPED].
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE
CHALLENGE, BUT IF THEY THINK I'M
NOT GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE
SITUATION, THEY DON'T KNOW THE
QUEEN.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
.
 Jeff: I HAVE THE IDOLS.
LET'S GET TO IT.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL
DIVE INTO THE WATER, RACE
THROUGH A SERIES OF MONKEY BARS.
YOU'LL THEN LIFT HEAVY PUZZLE
PIECES TO A SLED, PULL THE SLED
THE SHORE, DRAG IT TO THE
FINISH.
THREE TRIBE MEMBERS WILL THEN
WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE A BARREL
PUZZLE.
FIRST TRIBE TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND THEIR TRIBE WILL RECEIVE
DEBBIE AS A NEW TRIBE MEMBER.
BIG STAKES.
TAKE A MINUTE THE STRATEGIZE.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
OZZY WAITING UNTIL THE END WITH
A BIG DIVE.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET TO THAT
PLATFORM, AND THEN ONE AT A TIME
YOU'LL MAKE YOU WAY ACROSS THE
MONKEY BARS.
 COME ON, YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: NUKU WORKING
TOGETHER.
 LET'S GO.
 Jeff: MANA WORKING
TOGETHER.
 BRAD, GO.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER STARTS
ACROSS.
MANA IS IN THE EARLY LEAD.
 GO, GO GO,.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER ACROSS
QUICKLY.
GO, SIERRA.
 THAT'S IT.
 GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO.
 Jeff: HERE GOES OZZY.
 YOU GOT THIS.
 Jeff: CIERA'S ACROSS.
OZZY IN THE WATER.
HERE GOES VARNER.
MANA WORKING VERY EFFICIENTLY.
HERE COMES TROYZAN FOR MANA.
HE'S THROUGH QUICKLY.
SANDRA TAKING A LONG TIME FOR
NUKU.
 GOOD JOB, SANDRA.
YOU GOT THIS.
HALI MAKES HER WAY ACROSS
QUICKLY.
NUKU STILL HAS A LOT OF TRIBE
MEMBERS LEFT.
MANA STILL IN THE LEAD.
HERE COMES MICHAELA.
MANA IS THROUGH THE MONKEY BARS.
 COME ON, GUYS!
 LET'S GO.
 Jeff: TAI MAKING UP A LOT
OF TIME.
IT'S GOING TO BE CULPEPPER AND
SIERRA LEFTING PIECES FOR MANA.
 READY?
ONE, TWO...
 COME ON, ZEKE.
 Jeff: ZEKE MAKING HIS WAY
TO THE END.
THEY'RE CLOSING THAT GAP.
 WE HAVE TO GET BACK ON.
MANA HAS THEIR PIECES.
YOU'RE GOOD, PULL AND PUSH,
THOSE PIECES ARE HEAVY.
 RIGHT, THERE RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE.
 Jeff: MANA WORKING ON THEIR
SECOND SET OF PUZZLE PIECES.
 YOU GOT IT?
 Jeff: NUKU ON THEIR FIRST
SET.
NUKU WORKING VERY QUICKLY, VERY
EFFICIENTLY.
 JUST GET READY TO PUSH, GET
READY.
NO MANA HAS ONE LEFT.
NUKU GETTING CLOSER, HEADING FOR
THAT SECOND SET OF PUZZLE
PIECES.
THAT LEAD IS EVAPORATING.
 COME ON, GUYS.
THE.
WE'RE RIGHT ON THEM, GUYS.
 Jeff: MANA HAS ALL THEIR
PIECES.
NUKU RIGHT BEHIND.
 HURRY UP.
 WATCH YOUR FOOT, WATCH YOU
FOOT.
 Jeff: NOW YOU HAVE TO USE
THE LOGS TO HELP MOVE THIS SLED
TO THE FINISH.
THAT SAND IS TOO TOUGH TO PULL
IT THROUGH.
 READY?
 Jeff: NUKU HAS ALL THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES.
CAN THEY GET IT DONE?
CAN THEY CATCH UP.
 I'M PULLING.
IT AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
 Jeff: MANA WORKING TOGETHER
NICELY WITH THE LOGS.
NUKU STARTING TO CLOSE THE G.P.
 KEEP IT COMING.
 WE NEED THE BACK ROW.
 Jeff: THERE IS NOTHING EASY
ABOUT THIS.
THAT SLED AND THOSE PIECES WEIGH
A LOT.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS!
 HURRY UP, GUYS.
HUSTLE.
 OH, MY GOD.
 KEEP GOING.
 Jeff: YOU WANT IT, THIS IS
WHERE YOU EARN IT, RIGHT HERE.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO TRIBAL.
 ONE, TWO, THREE.
 Jeff: ONCE YOU GET IT UP
THAT HILL, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
PULL IT IN THE SAND.
 LET'S JUST GO.
 COME ON, YOU GUYS.
 GOT TO JUST KEEP GOING.
 GO!
GO!
 Jeff: MANA GOT UP THE
TOUGHEST PART, WHICH WAS THAT
INCLINE.
YOU'RE GOOD.
UNLOAD THOSE PUZZLE PIECES.
 HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.
 Jeff: NUKU CONTINUES THE
TRY THE MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE
END.
TRIBAL COUNCIL LOOMING.
 PUNCH IT.
 Jeff: IT'S GOING TO BE
SIERRA, CIRIE AND AUBRY SOLVING
THE PUZZLE FOR MANA.
 I NEED A BACK PIECE HERE.
 RIGHT HERE.
YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD, NUKU.
UNLOAD POSE PUZZLE PIECES.
 COME ON, YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: THIS IS IT.
IT WILL COME DOWN TO THE PUZZLE.
 HURRY, HURRY.
 Jeff: WHICH THREE CAN WORK
TOGETHER THE BEST.
 YES!
JEFF, JEFF, JEFF.
 Jeff: MANA THINKS THEY HAVE
IT.
IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE FASTEST
FINISHES OF A PUZZLE IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.
THE.
WE GOT IT.
AND THEY DO!
MANA WINS IMMONTI, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 GOOD JOB, Y'ALL.
 Jeff: MANA,
CONGRATULATIONS.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
 THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: THANKS, JEFF.
 Jeff: NICE JOB.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM MANA.
NUKU, TRIBAL COUNCIL IS TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT
DEBBIE WILL JOIN YOUR TRIBE.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP WITH YOU.
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
 I HATED THAT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, HATED EVERY SECOND OF
IT.
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
TAI'S GOING HOME TONIGHT UNLESS
TAI PULLS OUT AN IDOL.
AND I'M HOPING THAT'S NOT THE
CASE.
 WELL, THAT SUCKED.
 THE IMMONEYTY CHALLENGE WAS A
BUTT KICKER.
WE GOT OUR TUSHIES HANDED TO US,
AND THE ONLY SOLACE I CAN TAKE
IS NOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
GET SANDRA OUT OF THIS GAME.
SHE'S THE MOST DANGEROUS PLAYER
ARGUABLY IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR," SO SHE'S GOT TO GO.
AND AS LONG AS SHE AND VARNER
THINK THAT TAI IS GOING HOME, WE
SHOULD BE FINE.
 WE GOT OFF THE BOTTOM OF THIS
REAL GOOD.
 UH-HUH.
 OF ALL THREE TIMES I'VE
PLAYED "SURVIVOR," I THINK THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME I FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG.
VARNER IS TELLING ME THAT TAI IS
GOING HOME.
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
SO I CAN'T JUST HOPE FOR THE
BEST.
I NEED TO ASSESS THE SITUATION
AND WORK MY MAGIC.
 YOU'RE SMART, YOU KNOW THIS
GAME, YOU KNOW THIS GAME, AND IF
THE MERGE IS COMING, THE LAST
THING YOU GUYS NEED IS DEBBIE,
TAI, AND AUBRY TOGETHER.
 I LAID OUT THE SCENARIO OF
THE THREE.
AUBRY IS STILL HERE, DEBBIE IS
STILL HERE, AND TAI IS STILL
HERE.
THEY COULD SAY THEY'RE NOT BEST
OF FRIENDS, BUT AT THE END OF
THE DAY, THESE PEOPLE SHARE
SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE SHARES,
THEY PLAYED THAT ONE SEASON
TOGETHER.
WHEN YOU COME OUT TO PLAY A GAME
LIKE THIS, YOU USUALLY STICK
WITH WHAT YOU KNOW.
 I DON'T LIKE THAT.
 YEAH.
 YOU'RE A VERY STRONG FEMALE.
SARAH IS A VERY STRONG FEMALE.
YOU'RE A VERY STRONG MALE.
AND IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP
YOU, PROTECT YOU, I'LL KEEP MY
EYES AN MY EARS OPEN.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON, WHAT THE SCOOP IS, WHO IS
COMING AFTER YOU, WHO IS SAYING
WHAT ABOUT YOU.
I CAN HELP YOU GUYS.
 YEAH.
 EVERYBODY LOVES YOU RIGHT
NOW, BUT WHEN [BLEEPED] GOES
LEFT AND IT'S EVERY MAN FOR
HIMSELF, YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT
THE DOOR.
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE, BEEN THERE
DONE THAT.
 THE REASON SANDRA HAS WON
TWICE IS BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
COME OFF AS THE MOST DANGEROUS
PERSON IN THE GAME.
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THE WAY
SANDRA TALKS TO PEOPLE IS SHE'S
GROOMING US.
SHE DOESN'T PRESSURE YOU.
HER VOICE NEVER RAISES.
IT'S CALM.
AND SHE JUST STARTS TO SUCK YOU
IN.
 SANDRA IS SO GOOD I WAS EVEN
CONSIDERING WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.
 FOR SURE.
 EVERYBODY'S VOTING SANDRA,
EVEN VARNER.
 NO, VARNER HAS IN IDEA.
VARNER THINKS IT'S TAI.
I DON'T WANT HER TO GET ANY
FURTHER IN THIS GAME, BUT I DO
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT SANDRA
IS SAYING ABOUT THE THREE GOING
TOO FAR.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
 I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT TAI
IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
 I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT TAI
IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
 I'M GETTING REALLY NERVOUS.
I FEEL LIKE CERTAIN
CONVERSATIONS I'M NOT INCLUDED.
I'M NOT VERY SMART COMPARED TO
ALL THESE DANGEROUS PEOPLE.
SANDRA, THEY'RE GOOD AT SCHEMING
AND PLOTTING.
IT'S NOT THE WAY I THINK, SO IT
MAKES ME NERVOUS WHEN THEY WALK
AWAY.
 YOU GUYS, I'M FREAKING OUT.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE EVERYBODY DISAPPEARS.
 I'M AN EASY VOTE.
IT'S EASY.
SANDRA.
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
100% POSITIVE.
 THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
 SHE CHARMS EVERYBODY.
I DON'T WANT HER TO GET TO THE
MERGE.
 TAI JUST SPILLED THE BENZ AND
TOLD VARNER THAT WE'RE ALL
VOTING FOR SANDRA.
 I WAS LIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS
HE DOING.
IT WAS STUPID.
IT WAS UNNECESSARY.
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
 SO YOU TOLD VARNER SANDRA?
 YEAH.
I DIDN'T THROW ANY OF YOUR NAMES
OUT.
I'M GOOD.
I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH WITH YOU
GUYS.
IT'S STILL A LITTLE
NERVE-RACKING, THOUGH.
SANDRA HAS WON TWICE.
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE HER DOWN.
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE I'M IN A
RISKY SPOT, BUT I CAN'T GET
PARANOID.
I HAVE TWO IDOLS, SO I SHOULD BE
SAFE.
 DID HE SAY WHY HE WANTED ME
OUT?
 JUST SANDRA.
 SANDRA.
 COMING INTO THIS GAME, I KNEW
I'D HAVE THE BIGGEST TARGET ON
MY BACK, AND NOW TAI IS SAYING
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME.
 I'M GOING TO ACT LOOK I'M
GOING HOME.
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ALL
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT TAI IS
ENEMY NUMBER ONE.
I'M GOING TO SET HIM UP BIG
TIME, AND I'M GOING THE TWIST IT
AROUND, AND HE WILL GO HOME.
 Jeff: IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME
AT TRIBAL.
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.
APPROACH A FLAME.
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
WE'LL NOW BRING IN DEBBIE
RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND.
SHE WILL BE JOINING YOUR TRIBE
AT THE END OF TONIGHT'S TRIBAL.
ANDREA, DAY 16 OF GAME CHANGERS.
WHAT IS THE STATE OF THE GAME?
 SO FAR IN THIS GAME IT'S ALL
ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE BIG
THREAT.
WE'RE ALL THINKING, ALL RIGHT, I
GUESS THAT'S HOW THIS SEASON IS
GOING.
LET'S FIND THE NEXT BIG THREAT
TO GET RID OF.
 Jeff: AND YET OZZY, THERE
ISN'T REALLY ANYBODY HERE WHO
ISN'T A THREAT.
SO ARE THERE PEOPLE YOU'RE
DEBATING BETWEEN?
 EVERY SINGLE DAY I'M DEBATING
BETWEEN PEOPLE.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU CAN FIT
IN WITH A GIANT TARGET JUST LIKE
ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT
TAKE THE HIT BEFORE I DO.
SO IT'S A CONDITION ASSISTANT
DEBATE.
 Jeff: SANDRA, HE WAS
LOOKING AT THE BACK OF YOUR
HEAD.
 IT'S BEEN 16 GREAT DAYS,
JEFF.
BUT I THINK THIS IS IT FOR ME.
 Jeff: REALLY?
 I WENT INTO THE NEW NUKU
TRIBE AT THE BOTTOM, AND IN THE
THREE DAYS I'VE BEEN THERE, NO
ONE HAS TALKED STRATEGY TO ME.
 Jeff: SO YOU'VE NOT HEARD
ANY NAMES.
YOU'VE JUST HEARD NOTHING.
 I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY GAMES.
I JUST CONSIDERED ME THEY
CONSIDERED ME A BIG PLAYER.
 TAI, YOU WERE WATCHING
SANDRA, THE WHOLE TIME SHE WAS
TALKING.
 YEAH.
I MEAN, WHAT SHE DESCRIBED TO
PUT IT ACCURATE.
 Jeff: SO YOU THINK SANDRA
IS GOING HOME TONIGHT?
 WELL, I WOULD NOT SAY THAT,
BECAUSE I'M WORRIED TONIGHT
MYSELF.
 Jeff: WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?
 WELL, AFTER TAKING OUT
MALCOLM, I MADE A GAME-CHANGING
MOVE, SO, YEAH, I'M --.
 Jeff: TAI, YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE LOST IN THOUGHT.
 I'M PARANOID.
ALL THESE ARE BIG NAMES LIKE
SANDRA AND OZZY, AND I'M
NERVOUS.
AND WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION?
I'M SORRY.
 Jeff: I THINK YOU JUST
ANSWERED IT.
 I DON'T KNOW.
ANYTHING CAN GO.
I JUST HOPE I'M SAFE.
 Jeff: SO SARAH, SANDRA IS
SAYING NOBODY IS TALKING TO HER.
HAVE YOU NOT HEARD ANY NAMES
EITHER.
 NO, I'VE HEARD A FEW NAMES,
AND I THINK COMING INTO TRIBAL,
SOME OF US ARE STILL OPEN.
 Jeff: TAI, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SO NERVOUS.
 YEAH.
I THOUGHT ONLY ONE NAME WAS
SANDRA.
BUT SARAH IS SAYING THERE IS
ANOTHER NAME BROUGHT UP THAT I'M
NOT AWARE OF.
SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
HAPPENING.
I THOUGHT WE WERE TOGETHER
COHESIVELY.
NOW WHO KNOWINGS.
 Jeff: SANDRA, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR?
 IF TAI WANTS TO SPIT OUT A
NAME, AS LONG AS IT AIN'T ME,
I'LL VOTE WITH YOU, TAI.
 CAN I DO THAT IN SECRET?
 YOU CAN WHISPER IN MY EAR.
 ALL RIGHT.
AS LONG AS IT AIN'T ME.
JUST DON'T WHISPER MY NAME.
 YEAH.
YEAH.
 OH, OKAY.
 GOOD?
 YEAH.
I'LL DO IT.
 OKAY.
 WE NEED ONE MORE THE MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.
 HOW AM I GOING TO DO THAT.
 THERE'S ONLY THREE OF US.
YOU NEED FOUR.
 I NEED ONE MORE.
ALL RIGHT.
SO DO YOU WANT THE SHARE WITH
ALL OF US?
 I'LL SHARE WITH YOU GUYS.
OKAY.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
I JUST NAMED OZZY.
I'M JUST VOTING OUT THE BIGGEST
GUY.
I KNOW I CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST
HIM.
HE'S A GOD.
HE DOES EVERYTHING SO WELL.
HE CAN DIVE, HE CAN HOLD HIS
BREATH, HE CAN SWIM.
HE CAN DO EVERYTHING SO WELL.
I KNOW THERE'S IN WAY I CAN TAKE
HIM IN THE IMMUNITY.
AND I CAN SEE THAT MERGE IS
COMING UP VERY SOON.
A COUPLE VOTES.
SO NOW IS THE TIME AND...
 Jeff: NO EVERYBODY IS
TALKING.
 WELL, WHY NOT?
RIGHT?
WE'RE SMALL PEOPLE.
HE'S BIG.
JUST DO SOMETHING.
IT'S UP TO YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW I'M LOYAL.
 TAI, I HAVE A QUESTION FORT
YOU.
WHO DO HOU TRUST IN THIS GAME?
BECAUSE YOU KEEP TELLING ME THAT
YOU TRUST ME AND THAT YOU TRUST
SARAH AND THAT YOU TRUST ANDREA
AND YOU TRUST OZZY, MAYBE I WANT
TO VOTE WITH YOU, BUT HOW CAN I
TRUST YOU IF I I DON'T KNOW WHO
ELSE YOU TRUST IN THIS GAME, AND
I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU GO RUN OFF
AND LOOK FOR THE IDOL ALL THE
TIME.
 I'M NOT THE ONE THAT LOOKS
FOR AN IDOL ALL THE TIME.
 I DON'T KNOW, TAI.
 CAN WE JUST VOTE?
 I'M READY TO VOTE.
 SOUNDS LIKE I'M READY.
 I'M READY.
 OKAY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
ANDREA, YOU'RE UP.
 OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THAT WAS
DRAMATIC.
 TAI, YOU'RE A FOOL.
YOU THREW MY NAME OUT THERE.
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW, WHEN YOU
COME AFTER ME, I BURY YOU.
THE QUEEN STAYS QUEEN, ADIOS.
THE QUEEN STAYS QUEEN, ADIOS.
 I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE TAI.
TAI.
TWO VOTES TAI.
SANDRA.
SANDRA.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES TAI, TWO
VOTES SANDRA.
SANDRA.
THAT'S THREE VOTES SANDRA.
THE SUCTION PERSON VOTED OUT,
SANDRA.
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 I WISH YOU GUYS LUCK.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU GUYS KNOCK IT OUT.
 Jeff: SANDRA FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 94 DAYS OF "SURVIVOR,"
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 DON'T DO IT, JEFF, DON'T DO
IT, JEFF, DON'T DO IT.
[APPLAUSE]
 GOOD LUCK.
 THE QUEEN.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 ALL RIGHT.
BYE.
 BYE, SANDRA.
WELL, ONCE AGAIN I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
AND IT'S A FEELING I'M STARTING
TO GET USED TO.
DEBBIE, A TORCH AND A NUKU BUFF
WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP.
FOR THE REST OF YOU, GREAT
BRITAIN YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," MANA REACHES THEIR
BREAKING POINT.
 THIS GAME IS HARD.
 Jeff: ALLIANCES IMPLODE.
 I AM IRATE RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: AND VARNER SEEINGS AN
OPENING.
 I'VE GOT TO THROW THE SHADE
ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
 I'D VOTE FOR OZZY.
 Jeff:
 JEFF GOT TO SNUFF MY TORCH,
BUT I DID GOOD CONSIDERING I'M A
TWO-TIME WINNER.
I OWE A LOT TO "SURVIVOR."
BUT I LOVE "SURVIVOR" AND IT'S
IN MY HEART.
AND I KNOW WHY I LIVE THE LIFE I
LIVE, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF
"SURVIVOR."
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER
TWO-TIME WINNER EXCEPT THE
QUEEN.
