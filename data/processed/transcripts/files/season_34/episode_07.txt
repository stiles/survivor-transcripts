         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE MANA TRIBE,
HALI AND MICHAELA WERE LEFT OUT
OF THE CULPEPPER ALLIANCE.
 I HAVE PEOPLE WHOM I WANT TO
GO WITH.
 Jeff: AT THE NUKU TRIBE,
VARNER KNEW HIS GAME WAS FALLING
APART.
 IF I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT,
I'M GOING TO CUT THEM ALL OFF AT
THE KNEES.
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
VARNER MADE A DESPERATE MOVE.
 THERE IS DECEPTION HERE,
JEFF.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ANYONE
YOU'RE TRANSGENDER.
 BUT THAT'S PERSONAL.








 THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE GAME.
 YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
 THAT IS SO WRONG.
NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO OUT
ANYBODY.
 Jeff: AND HE WAS VOTED OUT.
VARNER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
13 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
 LAST NIGHT EVERY LAST ONE OF
YOU FORGAVE VARNER, AND I DON'T
FORGIVE THAT GUY YET.
 OKAY.
 THAT'S OKAY IF YOU DO.
 THAT'S FINE.
I WANT TO GIVE VARNER A LITTLE
COMFORT.








IT'S JUST COMPASSIONATE.
THAT'S WHO I AM.
 THAT'S OKAY.
AND I DON'T CARE THAT YOU DID
THAT.
AND I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME
FOR NOT.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
HE TOOK AWAY SO MUCH FROM ZEKE.
THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW, I'M
A LITTLE BIT EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.
 I COME FROM A VERY
CONSERVATIVE BACKGROUND.
I DON'T KNOW ANY TRANSGENDER
PEOPLE UNTIL NOW, AND THE FACT
I'VE BEEN WITH ZEKE AND GOTTEN
TO KNOW HIM AS A AMERICAN FROM
FROM -- AS A PERSON FROM DAY
ONE, I LOVE THAT GUY, AND IT
DOESN'T CHANGE WHO HE IS TO ME.
IF ANYTHING IT MAKES US STRONGER
I FEEL.
SO I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND
ZEKE IS ZEKE.
I ALMOST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S
REAL.
I ONLY KNOW YOU AS ZEKE, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
 YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
THE CRY AND YELL, SO I WAS LIKE,
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OKAY.
 I KNOW, BUT THAT WASN'T COOL.
 NO, IT WASN'T.
AND I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY HOW
EVERYONE RESPONDED.
ONE OF THE REASONS I DIDN'T TELL
PEOPLE IS I WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE
ME AS MYSELF.
OFTEN IN MY LIFE, WHEN I TELL
PEOPLE I'M TRANS THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE INTERESTED IN, AND
EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME GETS
PUSHED TO THE WAYSIDE, BUT
"SURVIVOR" MAKES YOU TOUGH.
IT MAKES YOU RESILIENT, AND IT
MAKES YOU ADAPTABLE.
AND I THINK I HAD ALL THOSE
QUALITIES BEFORE, BUT THEY'VE
CERTAINLY BEEN STRENGTHENED AND
GROWN.
AND I THINK I WAS ABLE TO BE A
LITTLE MORE BRAVE AND A LITTLE
BOLDER TO HELP OTHERS AND ALSO
TO GET OVER MY OWN FEARS AND TO
GET OVER MY OWN, YOU KNOW,
ISSUES AND COMPLEXES AND
INSECURITIES OF BEING
TRANSGENDER.
 I'M GLAD IT'S, YOU KNOW, WE
MOVED PAST THAT.
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 IT'S BRINGING US ALL CLOSER
TOGETHER.
 I REALLY, RAELY LIKE THE
PEOPLE I'M PLAYING WITH.
IT IS HEARTENING IN THIS GAME
THAT OFTEN YOUR LOWEST MOMENT,
YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMETHING BAD
DOES HAPPEN TO YOU, THAT PEOPLE
WHO ARE OUT TO GET YOU IN SOME
REGARD DO STAND IN YOUR DEFENSE
AND DO COME TO YOUR DEFENSE.
I WAS TRULY TOUCHED, BUT IN THE
MEANTIME, THERE'S STILL A TASK
I'M COMMITTED.
TO I'M HERE TO ONE $1 MILLION.
I'M HERE THE PLAY "SURVIVOR."
SO LET'S JUST GET BACK TO IT.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
 WE WALK INTO THE CHALLENGE,
AND THERE'S A BUFFET ON THE
TABLE.
IT IS A MERGE FEAST.
SO YOU'RE HAPPY.
 OH, MY GOD.
LOOK.
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S
JEFF NEXT TO A TABLE, COVERED.
SO IT'S LIKE, UH-OH, SOMETHING
AIN'T RIGHT.
 MY HEART IS POUNDING FOR THAT
FOOD RIGHT NOW.
 SIERRA, EVEN AS YOU WERE
WALKING UP AND YOU NOTICED THERE
WAS CLEARLY A MERGE FEAST, YOU
SAID, "MY HEART IS POUNDING."
 IT'S STILL RACING.
JEFF, I'M STARVING.
 Jeff: OZZY, HOW IMPORTANT
IS FOOD RIGHT NOW?
 WE'RE ALL INCREDIBLY HUNGRY.
AND WE'RE HYPER AWARE OF THE
IMPORTANCE OF THAT AS WELL AS
WHAT IS UNDER THERE.
 Jeff: THAT'S INTERESTING
BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT TO COME
INTO PLAY.
BEFORE WE OFFICIALLY MERGE, YOU
HAVE ONE LAST DECISION TO MAKE
AS TRIBES.
IN ORDER TO ENJOY THIS BEAUTIFUL
MEAL, ONE PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE
MUST VOLUNTEER TO NOT TAKE PART.
 OH, MY GOD.
Captioning funded by CBS
( THEME SONG PLAYING )
 Jeff: IF WE DON'T HAVE TWO
VOLUNTEERS, ONE FROM EACH TRIBE,
TO SIT OUT OF THE FEAST, THE
FEAST GOES AWAY AND INSTEAD YOU
WILL CELEBRATE THE MERGE WITH AN
INDIVIDUAL CRACKER AND A SWIG OF
ICED TEA.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: BIG DILEMMA.
ZEKE, THIS DECISION IS QUITE
LAYERED AND COMPLICATED.
 YOU KNOW, ON THE ONE HAND, I
COULD GIVE ME ALLIES A CHANCE TO
EAT, IF I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE
BURDEN UPON MYSELF, BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND, I MIGHT NEED THAT
FUEL BECAUSE EVERYBODY MIGHT BE
COMING AFTER ME.
 I'LL DO IT.
I'LL DO IT.
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.
I CAN CATCH FISH.
I PROMISE YOU.
 Jeff: SO CULPEPPER, YOU
IMMEDIATELY SAID, I'LL DO IT.
 I GOT IT.
IT'S WHAT MONICA WOULD DO.
 HERE'S THE DEAL WITH BRAD
CULPEPPER, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY HE CAME OUT IN THE FIRST
BLOOD VERSUS WATER, SO BRAD
FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO BE THE
HERO AND THE BRAVE PROFINDER.
I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH PART
OF THE CULPEPPER BRAND,
SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR OTHERS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE A VOLUNTEER FROM MANA.
NUKU, TOUGH DECISION?
ANYBODY OVER THERE WILLING TO
SAY,LY -- I WILL DO THIS?
 I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.
 I HAVE DECIDED.
 Jeff: TAI, YOU'VE DECIDED?
 YES.
I THINK THESE GUYS ENJOY IT MORE
THAN I DO.
 Jeff: ANDREA, SURPRISED BY
HOW QUICKLY TWO PEOPLE STOOD UP
AND SAID, IT'S IN THE THAT BIG A
DEAL.
 IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME TAI
WOULD DO THAT.
HE'S SO SELFLESS, HE'S SO
CARING.
I'M JUST SO THANKFUL.
SERIOUSLY.
 IT'S FINE.
I'M GOOD.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO VOLUNTEERS.
BRAD FROM MANA, TAI FROM NUKU.
MAKE THE LAST TRIBE DECISIONS
BECAUSE WE ARE OFFICIALLY
MERGED.
EVERYBODY CAN DROP YOUR BUFFS.
 BRAD AND TAI GOT BROWNIE
POINTS BECAUSE YOU PROVIDED FOR
EVERYBODY IN A SENSE.
BUT THAT MAKES ME SUSPICIOUS
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME
IS CALCULATED.
 Jeff: SO BRAD AND TAI, YOU
GUYS ARE GOING TO HEAD DOWN THE
BEACH.
YOU'LL FIND A LOG WITH TWO
YELLOW MERGE BUFFS.
HEAD OUT.
 BYE, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY ELSE, ENJOY
YOUR FEAST.
 OH, MY GOD.
 THIS IS THE BEST MERGE FEAST
I THINK I'VE EVER FEAST.
 PINEAPPLE.
 WHO WANTS SOME HAM?
 I WANT SO HAM.
 AM I GOING TO BE SICK?
I MADE THE MERGE.
I HAVE FOOD.
I FEEL LIKE A WHOLE NEW WOMAN.
AND NOW I'M GOING TO GO IN GUNS
BLAZING, AND I'M READY THE MAKE
SOME MOVES.
BUT I ALSO HAVE MY LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.
BUT I CAN ONLY USE IT WHEN THERE
ARE 13 OR SIX PEOPLE LEFT IN THE
GAME.
BUT I'M WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO KEEP IT IN MY BACK
POCKET UNTIL THE FINAL SIX.
 MAN, THERE GOES MY FIGURE.
I WAS DOING GOOD.
ONCE THE MERGE HAPPEN,
EVERYTHING TAKES OFF LIKE A JET
PLANE.
YEAH, WE ALL HAPPY AND WE'RE
EATING AND DRINKING AND LAST
SUPPERING TOGETHER, BUT PEOPLE
HAVING CONVERSATION, PEOPLE ARE
REUNITING, EVERYBODY IS SIZING
PEOPLE UP.
AND THINGS ARE GOING TO START
FLYING.
PEOPLE'S HEADS ARE GOING TO
START ROLLING.
SO THIS IS WHERE I STEP MY GAME
UP.
 CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.
 POOR BRAD AND TAI.
 BRAD IS AMAZING BECAUSE BRAD
IS STARVING FOR REAL, GUYS.
 I LOVE YOU TAI AND BRAD.
 DON'T WORRY.
 I LOVE YOU GUYS.
 IN FOOTBALL YOU'RE ONLY AS
GOOD AS YOUR NEXT GAME.
I MADE THE MERGE.
AWESOME.
IT'S IN MY REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
I'M LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD WHOM
IS THE NEXT PERSON GOING TO BE?
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.
 I'M GLAD WE MERGED.
 TAI AND I CONNECTED PRIOR TO
TODAY ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.
I THINK I'VE TAKEN OVER HIS
CALEB ROLE FROM LAST SEASON.
I THINK I CAN TRUST TAI GOING
FORWARD.
ON MY OLD TRIBE, MICHAELA AND
HALI WERE ON THE BOTTOM, SO I
WANT TO GUN FOR THEM FIRST.
 HOW ARE THINGS OVER THERE?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOT
SIERRA, WE GOT TROYZAN, WE GOT A
LOT OF LEVERAGE.
MICHAELA WE TARGET AND HALI WERE
TARGETS EARLY.
 LIKE THE BOTTOM?
 WHY?
 BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED THEM.
IT'S A GAME OF NUMBERS.
 YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AND
SOLID, I'M HAPPY BECAUSE WE CAN
JOIN IN.
 WE GET RID OF THOSE PEOPLE
FIRST AND WE'LL RECONVENE.
 PERFECT.
 I LOVE BRAD.
HE AND I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN
COMMON.
SO I THINK HE HAS MY BACK.
I HAVE A NUMBER.
I'M COMFORTABLE.
I'M HAPPY.
 WHAT ARE THEY CHEERING FOR?
 WHAT DID YOU HAVE?
DID YOU DRINK?
 OH, YEAH.
 SHAKE IT WITH ME, GIRL.
 OKAY, EVERYBODY.
 LITTLE DEBBIE GOT LOOSE.
SHE WAS TAKING IT ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
I THINK ALCOHOL WAS AN EXCUSE
FOR DEBBIE TO GO DEBBIE ON US.
 WE'LL GO TWO TOGETHER.
 I CAN SEE YOU TRUNKS RIGHT
NOW.
 I'M OKAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE
THINK I'M DRINKING.
BUT I NEVER HAD A SIP OF
ALCOHOL.
 DEBBIE, ARE YOU DRUNK?
 TAI...
 OH, MY GOD.
SHE JUST MOONED ME.
 I LOVE YOU, BABE.
 IF I HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE
DRUNK AND DO A BAD TWERKING AND
A SHAKING OF MY BOOTY THE CRACK
THESE PEOPLE UP AND FEEL VERY
COMFORTABLE WITH ME, I'LL DO IT.
 I LOVE YOU ALL, MAN.
NOBODY'S GOING HOME.
I LOVE YOU ALL, MAN.
AT THIS POINT 13 IS STILL A
LARGE NUMBER IN THIS GAME, AND
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR
ALLIANCES ARE, SO RELATIONSHIPS
ABSOLUTELY MATTER BECAUSE IF YOU
THINK OUR CAMP IS NOT GOING TO
BE FULL-BLOWN PANDEMONIUM,
YOU'RE A FOOL.
 WELCOME HOME.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, RIGHT?
 NOT TOO SHABBY.
 IT'S JUST LIKE WE LEFT IT,
HUH?
 CONGRATS FOR MAKING THE
MERGE.
 ONE HAPPY FAMILY NOW.
 GOOD THE SEE YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU AND
I SNAPPED.
YOU GET HUNGRY AND STRESSED.
 I KNOW.
I KNOW.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.
I KNOW YOU ARE.
 I SWALLOWED MY PRIDE AND I
DID APOLOGIZE TO BRAD BECAUSE ON
EXILE COCHRAN SAID EXTEND THE
OLIVE BRANCH ALL THE WAY AROUND.
WE KISSED AND MADE UP.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ME
AND BRAD WERE AS SOLID AS WE
COULD BE IN A GAME OF DECEPTION
AND INTRIGUE.
 I'LL TELL THE VARNER STORY.
HERE'S THE THING, WE GET THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND WE'RE NOT
FIVE MINUTES IN BEFORE VARNER
TAKES IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAY
ZEKE IS DECEIVING YOU BECAUSE
WHAT ZEKE IS NOT TELLING YOU IS
THAT ZEKE IS TRANSGENDER.
 THAT'S WHAT HE SAID?
 WHICH IS TRUE.
 WAIT, JUST LET HIM TALK.
 I AM.
SO IT HAPPENED IN A WAY THAT I
WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT.
I THINK I'M LIKE ALL OF YOU, AND
FOREVER CHANGED AND FOREVER
EVOLVED BY MY EXPERIENCE ON
"SURVIVOR."
AND I'M A MUCH STRONGER AND MORE
CAPABLE PERSON IN THAT MOMENT.
 GOOD DEAL.
 I WAS SO PROUD OF ZEKE.
AMAZING.
MORE RESPECT FOR ZEKE IN TELLING
HIS STORY THAN I DO FOR HANDFUL
OF THESE JOKERS IN KNOWING THEM
FOR 20 DAYS.
AND I THINK ZEKE IS RIGHT, THE
EXPERIENCE OF GOING ON
"SURVIVOR" MAKES YOU TOUGH.
AND NOTHING IS GOING TO BE EASY
ABOUT THE MERGE.
THERE ARE 13 PEOPLE AT THIS
CAMP, AND NOW THE GAME AT HAND
IS FIGURE OUT WHERE PEOPLE STAND
AND WHO IS IN THE LOOP AND WHO
IS OUT OF IT.
 LOOK, WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO
AT THIS POINT WITH YOU GUYS,
YOU, YOU, SIERRA AND...
 I GOT DEBBIE IN MY BACK
POCKET.
 EVERYBODY ON MY SIDE, LINE
EVERYBODY IS COOL.
 RIGHT.
 MY NUMBER-ONE COAL IS
RECONNECTING AND STRENGTHENING
THE BONDS OF PEOPLE I HAVEN'T
BEEN WORK PEOPLE I MAYBE HAD A
ROCKY TIME.
WITH BONDED WITH TAI.
DEBBIE HAS APOLOGIZED AND WITH
SIERRA AND MYSELF AND TROYZAN.
SO FAR SO GOOD.
 WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE
WANT AT THIS POINT.
 EITHER MICHAELA OR HALI?
 THAT'S FINE.
 I WAS THINKING MICHAELA
FIRST.
 YEAH.
SHE MAY BE GOOD AT CHALLENGES.
 FOR SURE.
 SHE WAS ALWAYS FIRST ON MY
LIST.
 IF I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
MYSELF AND WHO I CAN PLAY BEST
WITH, I DON'T FEEL THAT GOOD
ABOUT MICHAELA.
HER REPUTATION PROCEEDS HER A
LITTLE BIT, AND IN THE LONG TERM
I DON'T REALLY TRUST HER.
SO RIGHT NOW I'M GETTING
EVERYTHING TOGETHER TO GET ON
THE SAME PAGE, AND MICHAELA
WOULD BE THE FIRST GOBBLE UP
AFTER THE MERGE.
 AS LONG AS WE GO MICHAELA
FIRST, WE CAN BE IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT AFTER THAT.
 I'M FINE WITH THAT.
COOL, DUDE.
 MICHAELA FIRST TO GO?
 I THINK SO.
 OKAY.
 WE'RE GOING MICHAELA.
 OH, ALL RIGHT.
 I THINK MICHAELA.
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.
 HUH.
IF THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING, I
GUESS THAT'S IT.
 I THINK THERE IS A CONSENSUS
TO GET RID OF MICHAELA THEN
HALI, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
 IT'S GOING TO BE MICHAELA
FIRST.
 OKAY.
 1400%.
 I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.
 THAT'S EASY.
 OKAY.
 THAT'S PRETTY.
I LIKE THAT.
 MAKU MAKU?
 YEAH.
 OKAY.
WHO ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT?
 MICHAELA.
 I THINK OZZY WANTS TO HELP.
 SHE BETTER NOT WIN IMMUNITY.
 SO SHE'S FIRST.
 SO ME AND BRAD DON'T CARE TO
WORK WITH MICHAELA.
I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE SHIFTY.
SHE'S TOUGH TO BE AROUND.
SHE'S A LOOSE CANNON.
SHE'S A BEAST AT CHALLENGES.
 SHE WILL SNEAK UP ON EVERY
CONVERSATION.
THERE'S MANY THREATS THAT
MICHAELA HAS THAT KEEPING HER IN
THE GAME WILL HURT A LOT OF US.
IT'S SO EASY IF WE JUST STICK TO
THE PLAN.
 STICK TO THE PLAN.
 RIGHT.
 HOLD ON.
 HERE COMES MICHAELA.
THIS GIRL IS DRIVING ME BONKERS.
EVERY TIME I TALK TO SOMEBODY,
HERE COMES MICHAELA, CREEPING
AROUND A BUSH.
SHE WILL NOT ANYBODY TALK.
 ARE YOU HAVING A PRIVATE
CONVERSATION?
 NO.
WE'RE JUST DOING OUR LAUNDRY.
 SHE'S ALSO VERY BLUNT AND
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF TACT.
 WHAT DID YOU TELL PEOPLE
ABOUT ME?
 I SAID YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT
CHALLENGES AND THAT YOU ALWAYS
KNEW WHAT YOU WERE THINKING
BECAUSE YOU WOULD WRITE IT ON
YOUR FACE.
 YEAH?
 I'M CONSTANTLY ON EDGE WITH
MICHAELA AROUND.
THIS HAS TO BE A BLIND SIDE.
SHE CAN'T KNOW HER NAME IS
GETTING TOSSED AROUND.
IF ONE THING SETS MICHAELA OFF,
WE'RE ALL GOING DOWN.
 SOMETHING IS... SOMEONE IS ON
THE ROOF DROPPING STUFF.
 WHAT'S UP THERE?
IS THAT A CHICKEN?
 FRICKING IDIOTS.
 IT'S LIKE ME AND YOU AND
ANDREA, SARAH.
IT'S THE FOUR OF US.
 TO THE END.
I BELIEVE THAT 100%.
 IF MICHAELA IS FIRST VOTE,
OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S NEXT?
 RIGHT.
 WE HAVE TO STRIKE BEFORE
THEM.
 RIGHT.
 MICHAELA COULD BE A POTENTIAL
NUMBER FOR US TO WORK WITH GOING
FORWARD, THIS VOTE IS A BIGGER
DEAL THAN ANYONE IS LETTING ON.
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SORT OF
NATURAL GROUPS, FIGHTING TO GET
IN A POWER POSITION MOVING
FORWARD.
IT'S CIRIE, SARAH, ANDREA AND
MYSELF.
THEN THERE'S BRAD AND CIERA'S
GROUP.
I THINK EVERYONE IS WONDERING,
IS THE OTHER SIDE GOING TO
STRIKE FIRST, AND I'M GOING TO
BE CAUGHT WITH MY PANTS DOWN.
 WORD UP, STRAIGHT UP AND
DOWN, THIS CHICKEN GOT TO GET
OFF THE ROOF, BECAUSE IT KEEPS
DROPPING STUFF ON ME.
 WE HAVE TO STRIKE FIRST.
THESE ARE THS LAST MOMENTS OF
PEOPLE PRETENDING TO GET ALONG.
 WHAT'S IT DOING UP THERE?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 SMILE BEFORE THE BLOODBATH.
 HEY.
 THAT'S WHY SHE WENT UP THERE.
 WHO'S THAT?
 ANDREA.
 CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK,
CLICK.
NICE.
 WE'RE FIXING A CHAIR AND A
PIECE OF IT BROKE OFF.
 WE NEED A SCREWDRIVER.
 I KNOW.
 GOING INTO A MERGE, IT'S JUST
LIKE, PEOPLE ARE EVERYWHERE.
THERE'S POCKETS OF CONVERSATION
EVERYWHERE.
YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF WHO IS
ALL TALKING.
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
I FEEL LIKE ARE WORKING WITH ME
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME.
SEEMS LIKE MICHAELA IS ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK, BUT I WANT TO
WORK WITH MICHAELA.
I THINK THAT SHE'S A GREAT
PERSON, BUT SHE'S ALSO A GOOD
NUMBER FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
SO I JUST NEED TO LIGHT A FIRE
UNDER MCDONALD'S BUTT TO START
GETTING SOME STRATEGY ON THAT'S
GOING TO HELP ME.
 UTAH DAWE.
 GOOD JOB!
 AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME I
DON'T KNOW WHO HAS NUMBERS.
[INAUDIBLE]
 YOU CAN BECOME A TARGET VERY
QUICKLY HERE.
LIKE I'VE ALREADY HEARD MY NAME,
AND I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.
AND THAT REALLY KIND OF PISSED
ME OFF.
I'M ABOUT TO EXPLODE.
BEING OUT OF THE LOOP AT THIS
POINT IN THE GAME IS VERY
DANGEROUS.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOME
PEOPLE THAT I CAN TRUST SO I'M
NOT THE ONE GOING HOME.
AND MAYBE THAT PERSON IS CIRIE.
I ACTUALLY HEARD THAT MY NAME IS
COMING UP.
THAT'S LIKE THE ONE WAY TO PISS
ME OFF.
 YOU'RE A VERY SMART GIRL.
 YEAH.
 YOU HAVE TO CONTROL YOUR
EMOTIONS.
 YEAH.
 YOU CAN'T SHUT DOWN WHEN
EVERYBODY IS ELSE IS TALKING.
 UH-HUH.
 YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT
EXPERIENCE.
SO I WAS GOING TO PULL YOU TO
THE SIDE JUST FROM A WOMAN TO
WOMAN TO TELL YOU, CHILL OUT
WITH THAT, WHATEVER HAS BEEN
GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD, IF
YOU'RE HUNGRY, GET UNHUNGRY, IF
YOU'RE MAD, GET UNMAD.
 I GOT TO WORK ON THAT.
 YES.
I USED TO BE THAT.
MICHAELA WEARS HER HEART ON HER
SLEEVE.
I USED TO BE LIKE THAT.
LITERALLY WHEN I WAS MCDONALD'S
AGE, MICHAELA'S AGE, I WAS A
HOTHEAD.
I THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING.
BUT I'VE LEARNED WHEN YOU PUT
THAT GUARD UP, YOU PUSH PEOPLE
AWAY.
AND THE GAME LIKE "SURVIVOR,"
YOU WANT TO BRING AS MANY PEOPLE
IN AS POSSIBLE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PUSHING
PEOPLE AWAY OR MAKING PEOPLE
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO KNAVE
GAIT THIS WHOLE MERGE THING.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.
 YOU JUST GOT TO BE EASY.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU
HAVE TO LET THAT GO AND JUST BE
AS REGULAR AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE ANY TENSION,
IT DON'T TAKE A LOT HERE FOR
THEM TO LOOK AT YOU.
YOU CAN TAKE THAT FROM THIS
GAME, YOUR REPUTATION FOLLOWS
YOU.
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION IS THEIR
REALITY.
NO MATTER WHAT REALITY IS REAL,
WHAT REALITY REALLY IS, IT'S
WHAT THEY THINK.
THAT'S WHAT'S REAL TO THEM.
 CIRIE AND I HAD A REAL
STRAIGHT UP HEART-TO-HEART
CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE DO HAVE
A LOT OF SIMILARITIES, AND CIRIE
HAS SKYROCKETED IN TRUST WITH
ME.
AND I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED TO
PLAY WITH HER.
THIS IS A GAME-CHANGING SEASON.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN TWO
BLACK WOMEN GO TO THE END, YOU
MAY HAVE GUESSED IT FROM MY
AURA, I WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE WE
CAN WORK TOGETHER.
 UH-HUH.
RIGHT NOW MICHAELA IS PUBLIC
ENEMY NUMBER ONE, BUT I LIKE
MICHAELA, AND AS A HUMAN, AND AS
A OLDER PERSON TO A YOUNGER
PERSON, YOU WANT TO SAVE HER AND
IF I CAN DO THAT THAT'S ONE
PERSON THAT I CAN COUNT ON TO
HAVE MY BACK.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
OZZY, TAKE BACK TRIBAL IMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
TRIBAL IMMUNITY, NO MORE.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS WHAT YOU
COVET.
FUNKY LOOKING.
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK, YOU
ARE SAFE.
WITHOUT IT, YOU ARE NOT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S
CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING TO STAND
ON YOUR TOES WITH A BLOCK WEDGED
BETWEEN YOUR HEAD AND THE TOP OF
THE FRAME.
THE LONGER THE CHALLENGE GOES,
THE MORE FATIGUED YOUR LEGS WILL
BECOME.
WHEN THEY FINALLY GIVE OUT,
BLOCKS WILL DROP, YOU'RE OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, LOSER SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET
STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD AND PUT THE BLOCK ABOVE
YOU.
I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU IN.
THREE, TWO, ONE.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR HANDS.
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
VERY SIMPLE.
YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE FRAME.
HALI IS OUT WITHIN SECONDS.
TROYZAN IS OUT.
ZEKE IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO TEN.
THREE PEOPLE DROP WITHIN THREE
SECONDS.
 WALK OF SHAME.
 Jeff: I WAS SAYING YOU
CANNOT TOUCH THE FRAME AND YOU
CANNOT TOUCH THE BLOCK.
THIS IS GOING TO HURT INSTANTLY.
 I'M ALREADY SHAKING.
THAT'S CRAZY.
 Jeff: FIGHT THROUGH THAT
PAIN.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRETTY.
CIRIE IS OUT.
SHE COULD FEEL IT SLIPPING.
THIS IS A CHALLENGE YOU CAN'T
DRIFT AT ALL.
 HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
 Jeff: MICHAELA CHANTING.
TALKING TO HERSELF.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
 RELAX.
 Jeff: MICHAELA WOBBLING.
AN AMAZING RECOVERY.
HER BLOCK ACTUALLY SEPARATED BUT
DID NOT DROP AND SHE RECOVERED.
DEBBIE CAN'T HANG IN ANY LONGER.
DEBBIE IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO EIGHT.
 HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.
 Jeff: MICHAELA STRUGGLING.
HER BLOCK NOW SLOWLY WORKING ITS
WAY TOWARD THE BECOME OF THE
FRAME.
 HOLD IT.
 Jeff: MICHAELA ON THE EDGE.
MICHAELA IS NOW OUT.
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.
WE ARE QUICKLY DOWN TO SEVEN.
SIX DROPPED QUICKLY.
THE SEVENTH LEFT LOOKING GOOD.
WE ARE ONLY FIVE MINUTES IN TO
WHAT COULD EASILY GO OVER AN
HOUR.
 WE'LL WORK ON OUR TAN.
 Jeff: THAT'S HOW MUCH PAIN
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT
THROUGH TO WIN THIS.
OZZY DOING A LITTLE DANCE,
TRYING TO KEEP THAT BLOOD
CIRCULATING, KEEP THOSE MUSCLES
WORKING.
OZZY OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS.
OZZY IS OUT.
AUBRY WOBBLING.
AUBRY DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.
AND WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
YOU'RE GOING TO EARN THIS
IMMUNITY.
THAT FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL AFTER
THE MERGE IS SUCH A DANGEROUS
POINT IN THE GAME.
 SURE IS.
 EVERYBODY'S COME TOGETHER.
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHERE THE
TRUTH IS.
 SURE DON'T.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER STRUGGLING.
CULPEPPER OUT OF THE CHALLENGE,
AND WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR FIRST
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WITH A BIG TRIBAL COUNCIL.
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WITH A BIG TRIBAL COUNCIL.
25 MINUTES IN, A FEW PEOPLE
LASTED LESS THAN 25 SECONDS.
THREE WOMEN, ONE MAN, THIS
CHALLENGE HAS NEVER BEEN WON BY
A WOMAN.
 UH-OH.
 Jeff: SIERRA FIGHTING OFF
LOTS OF LITTLE SPASMS, OFF
BALANCE BUT RECOVERS.
SIERRA OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS AND
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.
JUST LIKE THAT SIERRA IS OUT,
LEGS VERY STIFF.
AND WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.
TAI AND ANDREA.
ANDREA ATE AT THE MERGE FEAST.
TAI DID NOT.
WILL THAT BE THE DIFFERENCE AS
THEY BATTLE IT OUT IN THE
34th SEASON OF "SURVIVOR"?
TAI HASN'T BUDGED.
ANDREA WOBBLING.
THIS REALLY HURTS.
IT DOES.
THIS IS "SURVIVOR" RIGHT HERE.
WHO WANTS IT MORE?
TAI DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.
TAI IS OUT.
ANDREA WINS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, BECOMING THE FIRST
WOMAN TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE.
 YOU'RE GREAT.
 Jeff: ANDREA, COME ON OVER.
[APPLAUSE]
FIRST PERSON THE WEAR THIS
NECKLACE, INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS
YOURS, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, YOU KNOW
THE DRILL.
21 DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH.
FOR SOMEBODY YOUR DREAM WILL
FALL SHORT.
YOU'LL BECOME THE EIGHTH PERSON
VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS."
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
WE'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
CONGRATS.
 TONIGHT'S VOTE SEEMS SO
SIMPLE.
HOWEVER, THIS IS "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS."
NO VOTE IS EASY.
EVERYONE HAS ULTERIOR NOTIVES.
SO TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO TAKE
CONTROL OF THIS GAME.
 NICE JOB, ANDREA.
 THANK YOU.
 HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD HAVE GONE?
 THE KEY IS KEEPING IT SO HARD
AGAINST YOUR HEAD.
AS OF NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M THE
PERSON WHO IS IN CHARGE.
I LOVE HAVING CONTROL.
FROM WHAT I SEE MY PERSPECTIVE,
THERE'S THE BIG GROUP AND WE
HAVE OUR OUTSIDERS WHO ARE HALI
AND MICHAELA.
I THINK MICHAELA GOING HOME
TONIGHT IS WHAT'S BEST, BUT I'M
REALLY WERE RID ABOUT AN IDOL
GETTING PLAYED.
I PLAYED WITH HALI BEFORE.
SHE'S INSANELY CONFIDENT THIS
TIME AROUND AND PLAYING A WHOLE
DIFFERENT GAME.
I THINK HALI HAS AN IDOL.
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S MY GUT.
AND I'M THINKING IF YOU GUYS ARE
DOWN, SPLITTING MICHAELA AND
HALI.
MOSTLY MICHAELA.
 YEAH.
 SEEING HALI PLAY THIS TIME
VERSUS THE TIME I PLAYED WITH
HER BEFORE, SHE'S PLAYING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
THAT TRIGGERS SOMETHING THAT SHE
MIGHT HAVE AN IDOL.
 OKAY.
 THIS TIME IT WON'T MATTER.
RIGHT NOW THE NUMBERS ARE SO
BIG, I JUST WANT TO SPLIT IT
BETWEEN THOSE TWO IN CASE THERE
IS AN IDOL.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SO THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE WHO
ARE GOING HALI.
 OKAY.
 EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING
MICHAELA.
SO MICHAELA IS GOING HOME
TONIGHT.
 AND HALI HAS THE IDOL?
 YEAH.
 WHO ARE WE TELLING THEM THAT
WE ARE VOTING FOR?
 SHOULD WE STICK WITH
MICHAELA?
 YES.
 SO WE'RE TELLING THEM THAT
WE'RE VOTING ZEKE?
 YES.
 I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT'S
GOING ON.
I'M SO CONFUSED.
 HE HAS THE ABSOLUTELY BEST
STORY.
 EVERYONE'S JUST SAYING ZEKE,
SO I'M GOING TO PUT DISEK'S NAME
DOWN BECAUSE WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE
RIGHT NOW?
BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE.
 I DON'T CARE.
I JUST FEEL LIKE MY NAME'S ABOUT
TO GET WRITTEN DOWN FOR SOME
REASON.
 I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE TO
VOTE FOR MICHAELA.
IS THAT GOOD FOR MY GAME?
WHY WOULD I JUST GO WITH THAT
PLAN?
BECAUSE SIERRA SAYS SO?
BEING THAT THERE WERE TWO
OPTION, MICHAELA OR HALI, WHY
NOT HALI?
 WHAT'S UP?
 SO THE VOTE AS IT STANDS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE MICHAELA, HALI,
RIGHT?
 THAT'S TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
 MY ONLY CONCERN IS THE REASON
THEY WANT MICHAELA IS BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO BRING IN HALI.
SO IF WE DO THAT, WE KIND OF
SETTING THEM UP.
 I THOUGHT THE CONCERN WITH
HALI WAS THAT SHE POTENTIALLY
HAS AN IDOL.
 THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO INCREASE THEIR NUMBERS, AND
IF THEY DO THAT, WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE US?
 SURE.
 TONIGHT'S VOTE IS THE OPENING
SHOT IN A WAR BETWEEN TWO
ALLIANCES, AND I THINK EVERYONE
SEES MICHAELA AND HALI AS
POTENTIAL SOLDIERS IN THEIR
ARMY.
SO THIS VOTE IS MAKING SURE THE
OTHER SIDE IS ONE MAN DOWN.
 JUST WATCH AND SEE IF THEY
TRY TO CONVINCE YOU MICHAELA
INSTEAD OF HALI AND I BET THEY
PROBABLY WILL.
BUT I DON'T SEE THE ADVANTAGE IN
THAT EXCEPT FOR THAT SIDE.
 SO I'M JUST NOW GETTING THE
WORD ON HOW THE VOTES ARE GOING.
I'M A LITTLE PERPLEXED WHY WE
AREN'T PUTTING THE MAJORITY OF
THE VOTES ON HALI.
 WHY WE'RE NOT?
 SEEMS LIKE IF SHE HAS AN IDOL
AND SHE DOESN'T PLAY IT, THEN
SHE'S LEFT IN THE GAME WITH AN
IDOL.
 THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT.
SHE'S GOING TO COME BECOME AND
WREAK HAVOC.
 THEN WE VOTE HER OUT IN TWO
DAYS.
 IF YOU'RE THAT
UNCOMFORTABLE...
 IT DIDN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF
SENSE TO ME.
 WE CAN DO WHATEVER.
IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WE JUST NEED THE STAY CALM.
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ARGUMENTS ON
BOTH SIDES.
 HERE'S THE THING, YOU CAN'T
WIN THE WAR UNLESS YOU HAVE A
SUFFICIENT ARMY.
AND IF MICHAELA GOES HOME,
THAT'S ONE LESS PERSON THAT I
CAN COUNT ON.
 GUESS WHAT?
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN.
[LAUGHTER]
 I'M TRYING THE SAVE YOUR LIFE
RIGHT NOW.
THEY'RE LYING ABOUT ME.
 MY NAME IS ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK, BUT I DON'T WANT TO
EXPLODE AT ALL, BECAUSE THAT'S
NOT GOING TO HELP ME IN THIS
SITUATION.
I'M SUPER THANKFUL TO HAVE CIRIE
HERE.
MY LIFE IS COMPLETELY IN CIRIE'S
HANDS, AND I TRUST IT THERE.
THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE PLAY WITH
PEOPLE I TRUST.
 I'M TRYING THE SAVE YOU.
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.
YOU HEAR ME?
NOTHING.
 UH-HUH.
 Jeff: EVERYBODY IS ON EDGE.
 EVERYBODY IS WATCHING
EVERYBODY.
SO I NEED MICHAELA TO VOTE FOR
ZEKE TO STICK WITH THE PLAN SO
NOBODY KNOWS CIRIE IS THE ONE
THAT CHANGED THE PLAN.
 JUST TELL ME HOW TO VOTE.
 STAY WITH THE VOTE FOR ZEKE.
 THANK YOU.
 FOR ME TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL IS ABOUT SAVING A PERSON
THAT I CAN DEPEND ON AND USE FOR
THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE.
AND IF I PULL THIS OFF, THE
FUTURE OF MY GAME IS LOOKING
GOOD.
GOOD.
 Jeff: CIRIE, THE LAST
PERSON TO MAKE IT TO TRIBAL.
HERE'S A TORCH FOR YOU.
GRAB IT.
LIGHT IT UP.
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE
IN THE GAME, AND WHEN IT'S OUT,
SO ARE YOU.
13 PEOPLE, ZEKE, THE GAME GOES
FROM TWO TRIBES TO THIS MASS OF
INDIVIDUALS.
HOW BIG A SHIFT IS IT IN HOW YOU
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE GAME?
 IT'S INSANITY, JEFF.
I MEAN, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
TO WATCH AND SO MANY PEOPLE YOU
CAN'T WATCH.
YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT HAPPEN
J AROUND YOU AND THERE IS
NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL
IT.
 Jeff: ANDREA, IF YOU WERE
EXPLAINING THE MERGE TO SOMEBODY
WHO HAD NEVER SEEN "SURVIVOR,"
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
THIS IS THE POINT IN GAME WHERE
WHAT HAPPENS?
 THIS IS THE POINT IN THE GAME
WHERE LINES ARE DRAWN.
THE FIRST COUPLE VOTES AFTER THE
MERGE ARE HUGE.
IT WILL SHOW WHERE THE ALLIANCES
ARE.
IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE REST OF
THE GAME.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, IS IT A
LITTLE BIT LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS,
CIRCLING, WAITING FOR THE MUSIC
TO STOP AND GRAB A SEAT?
 WELL, NOT TONIGHT IT WON'T
BE.
I DON'T EXPECT TO BE SHOCKED
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: HALI, WHEN YOU HEAR
DEBBIE SAY, WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO BE SHOCKED TONIGHT, DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, LIKE THIS IS
WHAT I THINK, TOO, OR DOES THAT
MAKE YOU UNEASY BECAUSE THIS IS
NEWS TO YOU?
 I'M IN THE DARK ON THIS
TRIBAL VOTE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A ROOM OF
PEOPLE CARRYING RIFLES, AND
THREE OR FOUR OF US ARE BLIND
FOLDED.
ONE OF US IS GOING TO GET SHOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS.
 Jeff: WOW.
MICHAELA, YOU WERE NODDING YOUR
HEAD.
DO YOU AGREE WITH HALI.
YEAH, BASICALLY WEREN'T TRYING
TO TALK TO ME TODAY.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE WORRIED
TONIGHT?
 OF COURSE, BUT IF PEOPLE WERE
PLAYING A TRULY INDIVIDUAL GAME,
THEY WOULD LOOK AT ALL THESE
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE
HERE, THEY'D LOOK AT WHO IS A
THREAT TO THEM, WHO PLAYS THIS
GAME MORE STRATEGICALLY, AND
THEN THEY WOULD LOOK AT WHO
RANDOMLY HAS THEIR NAME ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK BUT HAS NO REASON
BEHIND IT.
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GUIDING PEOPLE'S VOTE,
BUT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE, HEY,
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT IN THE DARK.
 Jeff: TAI, HOW DO YOU
FIGURE OUT WHAT VOTE TO MAKE
TONIGHT WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY
PEOPLE AND YET, AS ANDREA SAID,
THIS COULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT
VOTE.
 YOU HAVE TO LOOK NOT JUST TO
THE VOTE TONIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE NEXT
TWO OR THREE, THE NEXT VOTE DOWN
THE LINE.
 Jeff: OZZY, AT SOME POINT A
NAME HAS TO BE SAID, WELL, WHAT
ABOUT THIS PERSON.
FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, WHAT'S
THE CRITERIA?
 RISK.
ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN IDOL
BEING PLAYED, AND IT'S POSSIBLE
TO POINT THE VOTE AT THE PERSON
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN IDOL,
THOSE ARE BIG QUESTIONS IN THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, HAS THAT BEEN
A BIG TOPIC, IDOL, AND WHETHER
OR NOT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE ONE
AND IF SO WE SHOULD TARGET THEM?
 I LOVE TRIBAL.
IT IS THE QUINTESSENCE OF THE
GAME.
THIS IS THE COLISEUM.
YOU LIVE OR YOU DIE HERE.
AND TONIGHT I STILL FIND IT
EXCITING, BUT I THINK NOW, THE
PRESENT, IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME
TO TRY TO FLUSH AN IDOL.
 Jeff: CIRIE, ARE THERE EVER
PEOPLE AT CAMP THAT SAY, I'LL
STRIP DOWN, I'LL WALK TO TRIBAL
NAKED, I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.
 Jeff: THE PERSON WHO IS
THOUGHT TO HAVE THE IDOL, THEY
MAY NOT KNOW THEY'RE THAT PERSON
TO SAY, HERE'S MY POCKET, I
DON'T HAVE IT.
IF YOU THINK A PERSON HAS AN
IDOL, YOU DON'T TAP THEM ON THE
SHOULDER AND SAY, HEY, I THINK
YOU GOT AN IDOL.
 HEY, IF THIS IS AN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO, THAT I'LL
SHAKE DOWN IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: SO HALI, YOU'RE
CONCERNED THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT THEY THINK HAS THE IDOL AND
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
BLINDFOLDED.
IF I AM, SOMEONE CAN TELL ME IF
THAT'S NECESSARY.
I'M JUST HERE TO DIE ANOTHER
DAY, NOT THIS DAY.
 Jeff: ZEKE, WHY WOULDN'T
YOU TAKE SOMEBODY UP ON THAT
OFFER?
IT'S JUST MORE INFORMATION.
 I THINK NOBODY WANTS TO BE
THE PERSON THAT SAYS, OH, YEAH,
GO AHEAD, HALI, DUMP YOUR BAG
OUT.
 WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE
SECURE, YOU CAN MAN UP, TELL ME.
WE CAN DO A PAT STRIP SEARCH
HERE TO SETTLE THINGS.
IF THAT'S NOT WHAT NEEDS TO DO
IT ON MY OWN.
IF SOMEONE ASKS ME, I SHIEWFERL
WILL, THOUGH.
 Jeff: AUBRY, BRICK ME SOME
CLARITY.
WHY WOULD HALI SAY I'M WILLING
TO EMPTY MY BAG AND SHOW YOU I
DON'T HAVE AN IDOL, BUT I'M NOT
WILLING TO DO IT IF SOMEBODY IS
NOT WILLING TO ASK ME TO DO IT.
 I THINK THAT'S THE SIGN OF A
GOOD SURVIVOR PLAYER.
WE CAN SAY WE WANT TO BE AS UP
FRONT AND AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE,
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A SHROUD OF
MYSTERY IN THIS GAME, AND THINGS
CAN CHANGE ON A DIME.
 WELL, I WOULD INVITE PEOPLE
TO LOOK AT THE BLINDFOLDED
PEOPLE.
AREN'T THEY THE WEAKLINGS IN
THIS GAME?
ARE THEY REALLY THE GAME
CHANGERS?
IS THAT THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
NUMBERS, GUYS?
 Jeff: SIERRA, HALI IS
SAYING, IF YOU'RE TARGETING ME,
YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.
TAKE A TARGET OUT, NOT ME.
 I MEAN, YEAH, THAT MAKES
ABSOLUTE SENSE.
FREE AGENTS ARE KEY IN THIS GAME
BECAUSE THEY DO MAKE NUMBERS.
BUT THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE
TO GATHER THOSE NUMBERS, AND IS
IT NOW?
IS IT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME?
YOU DON'T KNOW.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TROYZAN, YOU'RE UP.
TROYZAN, YOU'RE UP.
 THIS IS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE AND
MINE.
HOPEFULLY THIS BRINGS US
LONGEVITY IN THE GAME.
HOPEFULLY THIS BRINGS US
LONGEVITY IN THE GAME.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE ZEKE.
ZEKE.
TWO VOTES ZEKE.
MICHAELA.
HALI.
MICHAELA.
HALI.
TWO VOTES ZEKE, TWO VOTES
MICHAELA, TWO VOTES HALI.
THAT'S THREE VOTES MICHAELA.
HALI.
THREE VOTES HALI.
MICHAELA.
FOUR VOTES MICHAELA.
HALI.
FOUR VOTES HALI.
FOUR VOTES MICHAELA.
TWO VOTES ZEKE.
HALI.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES HALI.
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, HALI.
THAT'S SIX, THAT'S ENOUGH, NEED
TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 OKAY.
 Jeff: HALI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 I ENJOYED MEETING EVERY ONE
OF YOU.
MAY THE BEST PLAYER WIN.
 ALL RIGHT.
 Jeff: WITH TONIGHT'S VOTE,
WE HAVE OUR FIRST MEMBER OF THE
JURY, WHICH MEANS EVERY VOTE
FROM HERE ON OUT BECOMES PART OF
YOUR RESUME SHOULD YOU MAKE IT
TO THE END.
GREAT BRITAIN YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I JUST FEEL LIKE THESE PEOPLE
ARE DUMB.
WHY DID YOU VOTE ME OUT?
YOU WANT TO SIT WITH THE BIG
STRONG STRATEGIC PLAYERS?
OR DO YOU WANT TO SIT WITH THE
HERD OF GOAT?
I'M JUST THANKFUL TO BE ON THE
JURY AND STILL BE PART OF THE
GAME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG.
FOR WHATEVER REASON I'M OUT AND
THEY'RE STILL IN, SO POWER TO
THEM.
 MICHAELA, HOW DID YOU SLEEP?
 PERFECTLY.
IT WAS THE MOST PEACEFUL REST
EVER.
 CIRIE STUCK HER NECK ALL THE
WAY OUT FOR ME IN TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND I'LL DO THE SAME
FOR HER IF I'M PUT IN A POSITION
WHERE I CAN.
 DON'T LET ANYBODY KNOW THAT I
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OR WE
HAD ANY CONVERSATION.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST ME
NOW.
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
HERE COMES BRAD.
 FOR SOMEBODY OF MY
BACKGROUND, BLACK AMERICAN
FEMALE, TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH
ANOTHER BLACK AMERICAN FEMALE,
THERE'S A LEVEL OF TRUST THAT IS
THERE AUTOMATICALLY, SO I'M
DEFERING TO HER RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE SHE UNDERSTANDS THE
DYNAMICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON MORE
THAN ME, AND LAST THING I WANT
TO DO IS MESS UP HER GAME WHEN
SHE TRIED TO HELP MINE.
 WHAT'S THE WORD?
 I THINK YOU'RE MORE IN THE
KNOW THAN I AM.
I TYPICALLY HEAR THE NEWS FROM
YOU.
 AT TRIBAL I VOTED FOR
MICHAELA, AND MICHAELA VOTED FOR
ZEKE TO GO, WHICH WAS WITH THE
PLAN, BUT I HAVE MY OWN IDEAS IN
MY OWN GAME THAT I WANT TO PLAY,
SO THIS NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
GOING TO LIKELY DRAG IT LOOSE.
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OUT IN
THE OPEN AND THE WAR IS GOING TO
START.
 BRAD AND SIERRA IS ONE.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED THEM.
 I KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH
THEM.
BRAD OR SIERRA, THEN, YOU KNOW,
I'M SKIPPING TO THE VOTING
BOOTH.
 THE WAY I SIERRA NEVADA
BREWING CO. AND BRAD, SIERRA IS
LIKE THE GODFATHER.
AND SHE'S CONTROLLING BRAD, WHO
IS CONTROLLING TROYZAN.
SO IF... IT'S LIKE A CHAIN.
IF WE CUT THE TOP LINK OFF THE
CHAIN, IT'S JUST GOING TO
SHATTER.
SO I THINK SHE COULD BE
POTENTIALLY ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
 IF WE WANTED TO VOTE BRAD OR
SIERRA OUT, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A SINGLE PERSON BESIDES
BRAD OR SIERRA THAT WOULDN'T BE
ON BOARD WITH THAT.
 ZEKE IS WILLING.
ANDREA IS DOWN.
I TRUST SARAH, AND I KNOW
MICHAELA WILL GO ALONG WITH IT.
WE'RE READY FOR WAR.
WE ARE SOLDIERED UP.
I THINK IT'S FOUR PEOPLE THAT I
KNOW SOLID.
THAT'S ZEKE, MYSELF, ANDREA,
SARAH.
TAI'S WITH -- FIVE WITH YOU, SIX
WITH MICHAELA, AND SEVEN WITH
OZZY.
 I FEEL LIKE I AM IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BIG ITALIAN FAMILY
BRAWL.
THERE ARE TWO SIDES, AND CIRIE
IS LIKE MY BLACK ITALIAN GRANDMA
OR AUNT.
SHE'S MORE LIKE AN AUNT.
AND IF I'M GOING TO BE ON TEAM
CIRIE, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
 SORRY.
 THAT'S OKAY.
 SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE,
LIKE CHECK IN LONG-TERM FOR YOU.
 I'M FINE WITH STILL FIGURING
OUT A SIDE, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
GET THERE FIRST.
BUT SIERRA IS GLANCING OVER
HERE.
SHE'S SO NERVOUS ABOUT US.
I'M DYING TO GET OUT BRAD OR
SIERRA.
I'M STARTING TO GATHER NUMBERS
TO SLOWLY TAKE OVER THIS GAME,
WHICH WOULD BE IDEAL.
SIERRA AND BRAD, THEY'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT US.
 AS WE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THEM.
 EXACTLY.
 BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN TELL
DEBBIE OR TAI.
DEBBIE IS PLAYING REALLY HARD,
AND SHE IS WITH SIERRA.
 IF YOU GUYS ARE CHATTING...
 NO, NO, NO.
 TYPICALLY I'M IN CONTROL.
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN A CLEAR
PICTURE SO FAR, BECAUSE MOST OF
MY INFORMATION HAS BEEN TOLD TO
ME FROM CIRIE AND FROM ANDREA.
THEY'RE IN CONTROL.
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.
I'M NOT IN THE POSITION I WANT
TO BE IN IN THE GAME.
 DEBBIE ISN'T WITH US.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 SHE'S A WILD CARD.
I THINK SHE WOULD DO WHATEVER.
SHE TALKS ABOUT THINKING.
 THE LAST TIME I PLAYED, I
MIGHT HAVE SHOT FOR THE MOON TOO
EARLY.
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE WITH
REGRET, YOU LIVE WITH THE REGRET
OF MAKING THE MOVE TOO EARLY OR
THE REGRET OF NOT GETTING THE
CHANCE TO MAKE A MOVE AT ALL.
YOU GOT TO REGRET MAKING A MOVE.
THAT'S JUST... YOU GOT TO PLAY.
 TAKE OUT SIERRA AND TAKE OUT
DEBBIE, AND THAT WORKS BECAUSE
SHE'S SHADY.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR
EYE ON SIERRA.
WE HAVE TO TAKE HER OUT NEXT.
 TO BE HONEST, BRAD AND
SIERRA, THEY'RE SORT OF A
THREAT, BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY A
THREAT.
BUT I LOOK AT CIRIE AND ANDREA
AS MUCH BIGGER STRATEGIC THREATS
THAN SIERRA.
THEY ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE
GAME.
SO I COULD GET OUT CIRIE OR
ANDREA IN THIS VOTE RIGHT NOW.
WHY WAIT?
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE IN
 YES.
 Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS OF SIX.
ON MY GO, TWO PLAYERS FROM EACH
TEAM WILL SWIM OUT AND RETRIEVE
A NET FILLED WITH WOODEN FISH.
BRING IT BACK THE SHORE WHERE
TWO OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS WILL
UNTIE THOSE FISH, HOOK THEM TO A
POLE, AND CARRY IT TO THE FINISH
WHERE TWO REMAINING TRIBE
MEMBERS WILL USE THE FISH TO
SOLVE A PUZZLE.
FIRST TEAM TO GET IT RIGHT WINS
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR IN
 YEAH.
 Jeff:
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: A DAY OF LUXURY.
 OH, MY GOD.
THE WINNING TEAM WILL BE TAKEN
TO THE MARSHAL'S LOUNGE WHERE
YOU WILL ENJOY A SHOWER WITH
SOAP AND SHAMPOO.
YOU'LL DRY OFF IN EGYPTIAN
COTTON TOWELS.
 JEFF, STOP.
 Jeff: RELAX IN FLUFFY
DESIGNER ROBES.
PAMPER YOURSELF WITH LOTION.
AN WHEN YOU'RE GOOD AND CLEAN, A
LITTLE MORE COMFORT IN THE FORM
OF BURGERS.
 OH, BURGERS.
 Jeff: APPLE PIE.
 APPLE PIE.
 TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
 Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?
 YES.
 Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO DO A
SCHOOLYARD PICK.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
HERE WE GO.
 OH, MY GOD.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.
SARAH WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE PICKED CULPEPPER, AUBRY,
MICHAELA, CIRIE AND SIERRA.
ANDREA WAS A CAPTAIN.
SHE CHOSE TAI, OZZY, TROYZAN,
DEBBIE AND ZEKE.
HERE WE GO FOR REWARD.
A DAY OF LUXURY.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
IT IS SARAH AND CULPEPPER FOR
ORANGE.
TROYZAN AND OZZY FOR BLUE.
TROYZAN DOING THE KNOTS ABOVE
THE WATER WHILE OZZY GOES
UNDERWATER.
AND BETH CULL PEPPER AND SARAH
ARE UNDER WATER.
ONCE YOU GET 'EM UNTIED, YOU CAN
START PULLING THOSE FISH IN.
CULPEPPER RELEASES HIS KNOTS
ABOVE THE WATER.
OZZY UNDERWATER A LONG TIME FOR
BLUE.
SARAH AND CULPEPPER HAVE THEIR
FISH FREE.
 NICE, GUYS.
 Jeff: TROYZAN AND OZZY
STILL STRUGGLING WITH THOSE LAST
KNOTS.
 THERE'S A FISH IN THE WATER.
 A FISH.
 SARAH, GET THE FISH.
 SARAH, GO GET IT.
 Jeff: SARAH AND CULPEPPER,
YOU GOT TO GET IT.
 GO GET IT, JEFF.
 Jeff: SARAH NOW SWIMMING
AFTER IT.
THAT WILL GIVE OZZY AND TROYZAN
TIME.
 KEEP GOING, GUYS.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER NOW HAVING
TO PULL THAT VERY HEAVY NET ALL
BY HIMSELF.
TROYZAN AND OZZY NOW CLOSING THE
GAP.
 WAY TO GO, TROY AND OZZY.
WE GOT IT.
WE'RE AHEAD.
 Jeff: IT'S NOW BLUE IN THE
LEAD.
THE BIGGEST REWARD OF THE
SEASON.
BOTH TEAMS CLEARLY WANT IT.
 YOU GOT IT, GUYS.
 Jeff: OZZYY AND TROYZAN
GOING TO LEFT IT AND START
WALKING.
YOU GOT TO DROP IT ON THE MAT.
GO!
IT IS NOW ANDREA AND TAI UNTYING
FISH FOR BLUE.
HERE COMES CULPEPPER AND SARAH
RIGHT BEHIND.
YOU CAN SEE HOW HEAVY THESE
PIECES ARE.
DROP IT.
YOU'RE GOOD.
SARAH AND CULPEPPER, YOU'RE
DONE.
IT'S NOW AUBRY AND MICHAELA.
WE ARE VERY TIGHT RIGHT NOW.
TAI'S GOING TO KEEP ON TYING.
ANDREA STARTING TO HOOK THE FISH
NOW.
 GOOD JOB, ANDREA
 Jeff: THERE ARE 14 FISH.
YOU HAVE TO GET THEM ON ALL THE
HOOKS AND THEN TRANSPORT THEM UP
TO THE PUZZLE STATION.
MICHAELA NOW HOOKING FISH FOR
ORANGE WHILE AUBRY UNTIES.
 GOOD GIRL.
WAY THE PLAY.
 Jeff: THERE WILL BE 14 WHEN
YOU'RE FINISHED.
TWO ON EVERY HOOK.
ANDREA AND TAI TAKE OFF.
 YOU'RE MISSING ONE.
HEY, GET BACK HERE.
COME ON.
COME ON, GUYS.
YOU'RE MISSING ONE.
 TAI!
 Jeff: YOU GOT TO GO BACK.
ANOTHER SETBACK FOR BLUE.
ANDREA AND TAI RACED OUT WITHOUT
ALL THEIR PIECES.
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR MICHAELA
AND AUBRY WHO DO HAVE ALL THEIR
PIECES.
THEY'RE NOW BACK IN THE LEAD.
A HUGE MISTAKE BY TAI AND
ANDREA.
AND YOU CAN SEE IT PLAYING OUT
RIGHT NOW.
EXHAUSTION SETTING IN.
YOU'RE GOOD.
IT'S NOW SIERRA AND CIRIE
STARTING TO WORK ON THE PUZZLE
FOR ORANGE.
TAI AND ANDREA THOUGHT THEY HAD
A GOOD SYSTEM.
THEY GOT AHEAD OF THEMSELVES,
AND IT HAS COST THEM A LOT OF
TIME.
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO CARRY THAT
POLE AGAIN.
BACK TO THE FINISH.
 YOU GOT IT, GUYS.
WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT!
 Jeff: CIRIE AND SIERRA
ALREADY STARTING TO WORK ON THAT
PUZZLE.
ZEKE AND DEBBIE NOW HAVE TO GET
ALL THE PIECES OFF BEFORE THEY
CAN START.
THIS IS THE KIND OF TIME
ADVANTAGE THAT CAN WIN
CHALLENGE.
BLUE HAD A HUGE LEAD AND BLEW
IT.
NOW ZEKE AND DEBBIE WILL HAVE TO
MAKE UP TIME ON THE PUZZLE.
MARSHAL'S LOUNGE FOR THE WINNER.
CAMP AND A HOT AFTERNOON FOR THE
LOSERS.
YOU'RE SOLVING TWO PUZZLES SIDE
BY SIDE.
BOTH HAVE TO BE RIGHT.
LIKE ANY GOOD "SURVIVOR" PUZZLE,
YOU WON'T KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT
UNTIL THAT LAST PIECE FITS IN.
CIRIE AND SIERRA HAVE ONE PUZZLE
COMPLETE.
IF IT'S RIGHT, DEBBIE AND ZEKE
TRYING TO CATCH UP.
CIRIE AND SARAH STARTING TO
STRUGGLE WITH THEIR SECOND
PUZZLE.
DIDN'T GO TOGETHER NEARLY AS
EASILY AS THAT FIRST ONE DID.
 NO, DEBBIE, HERE.
 Jeff: ZEKE THINKS HE HAS
SOMETHING.
ZEKE AND DEBBIE MAO MOVING VERY
QUICKLY.
THIS WOULD BE A BIG
COME-FROM-BEHIND IF THEY CAN
PULL THIS OUT.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: CIRIE AND SARAH NOW
THINK THEY HAVE IT.
 NO, HERE, HERE, HERE.
I GOT IT.
 DREW: ZEKE THINKS HE HAS IT
NOW.
 YES, YES, RIGHT THERE.
 Jeff: THIS IS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO THE WIRE.
WHO WILL GET IT FIRST.
 HURRY, HURRY.
 WHERE?
 HERE.
 OKAY.
 YEP.
JEFF!
 Jeff: DEBBIE AND ZEKE THINK
THEY HAVE IT.
AND THEY DO.
MARSHAL'S LOUNGE FOR ZEKE,
DEBBIE, TROYZAN, TAI, OZZY, AN
ANDREA.
 OH, MY GOD.
ANDREA, DEBBIE, ZEKE, TROYZAN,
OZZY, TAI, YOU WILL HAVE DAY OF
PAMPERING, FOOD, WHILE THE OTHER
SIX HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD OUT.
 OH, MY GOD.
 WE LOST THE MARSHAL'S SPA
DAY.
AND IT'S A HUGE LETDOWN, BUT I'M
FINDING MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE.
I HAVE OPTIONS.
AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BE WHICH
GROUP WANTS TO VOTE OUT THE
PERSON THAT I WANT TO VOTE OUT.
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO GO.
 WE COME BACK THE CAMP AFTER
WE LOSE THE MARSHAL'S REWARD
CHALLENGE.
 IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.
 IT WAS UP TO SIERRA AND TOY
WIN IT.
YOU COULD NOT DO IT TODAY.
YOU FEEL LIKE A LOSER.
AM I GOING TO DO ANYTHING?
OR AM I GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AT ANYTHING?
 SOMETIMES IF YOU JUST HAVE A
BREAKDOWN, YOU FEEL BETTER.
I'M SO ON THE EDGE OF BREAKING
DOWN.
 I HAD KIDS YOUNG, SO I WORKED
REALLY HARD TO PROVIDE.
I NEVER WANTED TO BE IN A
POSITION THAT MY KIDS NEEDED
SOMETHING.
BUT THIS GAME, IT TAKES YOU TO
THE DEEPEST LIKE MOST HURTFUL
PLACES THAT YOU HAVE EVER FELT,
ESPECIALLY IN A LOSS LIKE TODAY.
NOT BEING ABLE TO GET IT FOR
THEM IS LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO
PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY.
 THIS GAME IS SO HARD.
I FORGET EVERY TIME HOW HARD IT
IS.
DON'T MAKE ME CRY.
 IMAGINE IF YOU HAD FOUR KIDS
AND THEY DIDN'T EAT FOR THREE
DAYS.
AND YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE.
TO GO GET THEM FOOD, AND YOU
DON'T.
YOU FEEL WORTHLESS.
YOU DON'T EVER WANT THE FEEL
THAT.
SO I WORKED HARD IN MY LIFE TO
NOT EVER FEEL THAT.
AND IT TAKES YOU LIKE RIGHT BACK
THERE, LIKE ARE YOU WORTHLESS.
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S A LOT.
MY FAMILY IS MY MOTIVATION.
I PLAN ON WINNING FOR THEM.
I GUESS THAT'S WHERE IT GETS
EMOTIONAL FOR ME.
 IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
 IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
 THANK YOU, MARSHAL.
SO GOOD.
 MARSHAL'S PUT TOGETHER AN
AMAZING SPA EXPERIENCE FOR US.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST REWARD WE'VE
HAD YET.
 WE HAVE THE SHOWER.
 THERE IT IS, REALLY
BEAUTIFUL, TOWEL, AMAZING CHAISE
LOUNGES AND COCONUT-SCENTED
SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.
 OH, MY GOD.
WE GET TO EAT THIS.
 WHO WNS A COKE?
 WE WALKED INTO THE SPA.
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED IS THE
SMELL.
WE'RE SO DEPRIVED OUT HERE FROM
A LOT OF SMELLS.
WE ALL SMELL LIKE CAMPFIRE AND
SWEAT.
SO SMELLING THE NICE PERFUMES,
THAT ALONE IS A REWARD IN AND OF
ITSELF.
 I HEARD ABOUT DRINKING IN THE
'80s.
 TAI, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE DOING.
 WOW, TAI.
 ALL RIGHT.
TROY, YOU'RE NEXT.
 DIDN'T WE ALL THIS THAT IN
THE '60s OR THE '70s.
 I WASN'T BEEN YET.
MY EX-BOYFRIEND ALWAYS TALKED
ABOUT STREAKING IN ARKANSAS.
I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST FEELS
RIGHT.
I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD HAVE
FUN, AND IT'S A FUN MOMENT.
 REWARDS ARE GREAT, AND I'M
HAVING A GREAT TIME.
IT'S LIKE ALL THE FUN NOT IN
"SURVIVOR" ANYMORE.
BUT WHEN YOU REMOVE YOURSELF
FROM THE GAME, SOMETIMES YOU CAN
GET LOST IN THAT.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS GAME CHANGING.
YOUR MIND NEEDS TO BE RUNNING.
IF IT'S NOT RUNNING ALL THE
TIME, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT IN THE
GAME ANYMORE.
 MARSHALL, THAT WAS AWESOME.
 I'M JUST SAYING WE'RE
THINKING ABOUT IDEAS, WE MIGHT
WANT TO START EXECUTING OVER THE
NEXT FEW HOURS, WE COULD GO FOR
BRAD AND SIERRA, BUT CIRIE AND
ANDREA ARE A VERY TIGHT THING.
 WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
 RIGHT, YOU KNOW.
I'M AMASSING A TEAM OF SNIPERS
BECAUSE I KNOW THE WAR IS
COMING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS GAME
THINK THE WAR IS GOING THE START
ONE WAY.
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT WAR STARTS MY WAY.
 I THINK CIRIE HAS HER OWN
AGENDA.
I THINK CIRIE AND ANDREA ARE
SORT OF WITH US FOR NOW, BUT
CONVERSATIONS WITH AN DEGREEBACK
AND SHE'S LIKE, DON'T TELL
DEBBIE.
 SO LET'S TAKE OUT ANDREA.
 ZEKE IS THROWING OUT A STORY
TO GET ME AND TAI TO VOTE FOR
ANDREA, WHICH I IMMEDIATELY WAS
SCEPTICAL OF.
THE FIRST THING YOU ALWAYS
SHOULD ASK YOURSELF IN
"SURVIVOR" IS, IS THIS
INFORMATION TRUE?
 I AM IN THE IN A POSITION TO
BEAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE.
 SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO ASK
FOR FORGIVENESS THAN ASK FOR
PERMISSION.
 Jeff: IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
TAKE ANYTHING ZEKE SAYS AT FACE
VALUE BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO
FORM A COALITION FOR HIMSELF.
BUT I'M NOT IN ANY FRAME OF MIND
TO BE MOVING INTO THIS ZEKE
CAMP.
I'M OKAY TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR
ME.
I WANT THE MAKE A BIG MOVE, BUT
I DON'T NEED ZEKE TO MAKE IT.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YEAH.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ANDREA, I WILL TAKE BACK THE
NECKLACE.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO HANG ON TO A POLE FOR
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
WHEN YOU DROP, YOU'RE OUT.
LAST PERSON LEFT HANGING WINS
IMMUNITY.
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY HAS CHOSEN THEIR
STARTING SPOT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
OPENING STRATEGY, AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.
THIS IS A SURVIVOR CLASSIC THAT
IS NOT EASY FROM THE MOMENT IT
BEGINS YOU'RE STRUGGLING.
SIERRA HAS DONE THIS CHALLENGE
ONCE.
DID NOT WIN.
OZZY HAS DONE THIS CHALLENGE
TWICE, HAS NOT LOST.
HE IS UNDEFEATED IN THIS
CHALLENGE IN HIS "SURVIVOR"
CAREER.
NOBODY ELSE HERE HAS DONE THIS.
CULPEPPER STARTS TO SLIP.
YOU ARE 15 SECONDS INTO TO WHAT
COULD GO FOR A COUPLE HOURS.
CIRIE SLIPPING QUICKLY.
CIRIE IS TRYING TO HOLD ON.
NO.
CIRIE IS THE FIRST ONE OUT.
SPOT ON THE BENCH.
SARAH STARTING TO MOVE.
CULPEPPER SLIDING DOWN AND OUT.
CULPEPPER TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF
THE CHALLENGE.
WE'RE DOWN TO TEN.
DEBBIE SLIDING FURTHER DOWN THE
POLE.
SARAH SLIDING FURTHER DOWN THE
POLE.
THERE IS NOT SPOT THAT IS
COMFORTABLE.
AUBRY GOING THE TAKE HERSELF
OUT.
AUBRY NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.
WE'RE DOWN TO NINE JUST LIKE
THAT.
AND OUT OF NOWHERE, DEBBIE
SLIDES DOWN AND OUT, LEAVING
SOME SKIN BEHIND IN FIJI.
 YEAH, I DID.
 Jeff: DOWN TO EIGHT.
ZEKE IS OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO SEVEN VERY
QUICKLY.
 THIS HURTS.
 THIS IS NO JOKE.
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.
WOW.
 Jeff: SIERRA IS NOW OUT.
WE'RE DOWN TO SIX HALF OF THE
TRIBE IS OUT.
TROYZAN DOWN TO HIS LAST
FOOTHOLD.
SARAH DOWN TO HER LAST FOOTHOLD.
TROYZAN'S BODY FINALLY GIVES
OUT.
 GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
 Jeff: GOOD EFFORT.
SARAH IS RIGHT BEHIND TROYZAN.
HER BODY GIVES OUT.
 OZZY, YOU'RE A CHAMP.
 Jeff: WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.
MICHAELA, ANDREA, TAI AND OZZY
FIGHTING FOR ONE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.
THERE IS NOWHERE TO GRIP ON THIS
POLE.
MICHAELA LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
LITERALLY JUST STANDING ON THAT
FOOTHOLD, WHICH IS AMAZING.
ANDREA FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS.
 AND I PLAN ON BREAKING MY
RECORD.
 Jeff: ANDREA, HE BASICALLY
SAID, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE
NO CHANCE.
 PRETTY LEGIT.
I BELIEVE HE CAN DO THAT AGAIN.
 Jeff: MICHAELA ADJUSTING,
MOVING DOWN THE POLE AND OFF THE
POLE.
 GOOD GIRL.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WOW, MICHAELA, WHAT
JUST HAPPENED.
 OZZY AIN'T COMING OFF THAT
POLE, SO I GOT TO PICK AND
CHOOSE MY BATTLES.
 Jeff:
 YOU DID GREAT.
 Jeff: YOUR FEET ARE
STARTING TO FEEL IT NOW.
YOU'VE BEEN BALANCING FOR A LONG
TIME.
ANDREA READJUSTING.
BUT STILL IN IT.
TAI HAS NOT MOVED.
OZZY HAS NOT MOVED.
 OH, GOD, GIRL.
 DREW: ANDREA WITH A BIG DROP.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH.
I DIDN'T WANT THE SLIDE DOWN.
 WOW.
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ANDREA DROPS OUT,
LEAVING US WITH A SHOWDOWN.
TAI VERSUS OZZY.
TWO GUYS THAT SEEM VERY
COMFORTABLE IN TREES, VERY
COMFORTABLE JUST HANGING OUT ON
A POST.
COMFORTABLE JUST HANGING OUT ON
A POST.
BEEN OUT THERE ONE HOUR.
 OH, MY GOD.
 GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.
 DREW: DOING ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT THINGS YOU WILL EVER
DO.
 I'D SAY THAT PROBABLY PUTS
THEM IN THE LEGENDS CATEGORY
STAYING UP THAT FRICKING THING
LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: TAI ADJUSTING.
GOT TO KEEP THAT BODY ALIVE.
IT WILL GET NUMB FAST.
OZZY READJUSTING.
OZZY, HOW CONFIDENT DO YOU FEEL
KNOWING YOU'VE DONE IT TWICE AND
YOU'VE WON IT TWICE.
 I KNOW WHAT'S TO COME, AND
IT'S BAD.
IT STARTS HURTING, YOU START
SWEATING, YOU START SLIPPING,
BUT I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE, AND
IF I WIN I CAN GO FISHING TODAY,
AND IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO BE
HUNGRY ANOTHER DAY.
 Jeff: WOW.
THAT'S USING LEVER ACT.
 SORRY, BUDDY.
 NO PROBLEM.
 Jeff: I'M CHANCING IT.
 Jeff: TAI AND OZZY NOW IN
SIMILAR POSITIONS.
IT'S LIKE A COUPLE MONKEYS
HANGING OUT IN THE TREES.
NO BIG DEAL.
OZZY ADJUSTING A LITTLE BIT.
HANDS CAN GO UP TO THE ROPE, NOT
ABOVE IT.
OZZY TRYING TO KEEP HIS RECORD
INTACT.
TAI STARTING TO MOVE.
OZZY READJUSTING AGAIN.
NICE RECOVERY.
TAI HAS BEEN MOVING A LOT AFTER
NOT MOVING AT ALL.
TAI STRUGGLING TO GET A
FOOTHOLD.
OZZY SLIDING DOWN AND OZZY IS
OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.
TAI WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
HE THROWS OZZY, WHO HAS NEVER
LOST.
 WOW.
 Jeff: HE SENDS OZZY ALONG
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL WITHOUT IMMUNITY.
TAI WILL BE SAFE.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
 UNBELIEVABLE, YOU GUYS.
UNBELIEVABLE.
 YOU'RE BLEEDING.
 YEAH.
 GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
 Jeff: TAI, COME ON OVER.
 Jeff: I CAN'T BELIEVE I
BEAT OZZY, THE TWO-TIME
CHAMPION.
THE QUEEN.
THE KING, THE KING!
I WANTED TO GO AS FAR AS I CAN.
 Jeff: I HAVE TO SAY, THAT
WAS AN EPIC CHALLENGE.
TAI, YOU CAME OUT THE WINNER.
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, TONIGHT
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS."
GAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 SIDES ARE STARTING TO BE
TAKEN.
YOU NEED TO GET ON ONE OR THE
OTHER PRETTY QUICKLY, OR ELSE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE SMALL
SIDE.
IT'S GOING TO BE A CRAZY TRIBAL
BECAUSE IT CAN VERY WELL DICTATE
THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON.
 LOOK AT THAT.
 WOW.
 I RUBBED THE SKIN OFF MY
FEET.
 AFTER THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
I GET BACK THE CAMP, AND I'M
HAPPY THAT ANDREA DOESN'T WIN
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, BECAUSE I'M
GEARING UP FOR THE BATTLE OF MY
SEASON TO GET RID OF ANDREA.
 YOUR NAME IS THE NAME BEING
THROWN OUT TO GO HOME.
 OKAY.
 BY CIRIE, ANDREA AND AUBRY.
BUT I'M IN THE REALLY INTERESTED
IN SEEING THAT HAPPEN.
I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN
SEEING ANDREA GO HOME.
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY
CLOSE WITH THEM.
 YOU'D THINK I WOULD BE, BUT
I'M NOT.
 ZEKE IS ACTING LIKE HE WANTS
TO SWITCH SIDES ALL OF A SUDDEN,
BUT WHENEVER I TALK TO ZEKE, I
FEEL LIKE HE THINKS I'M STUPID,
AND I DON'T TRUST HIM, BUT IF
THEY'RE SAYING MY NAME, I GOT TO
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GET THE
NUMBERS SO I DON'T GO HOME.
 PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID
THEY'VE HEARD MY NAME.
IT WAS ZEKE.
 SIERRA JUST STOPPED ME ON THE
BEACH AND TOLD ME THAT ZEKE TOLD
HER THAT SHE WAS BEING VOTED
OUT.
 WHY ON EARTH WOULD ZEKE DO
THAT?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
 DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
 I AM FURIOUS AT ZEKE.
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH HIM SINCE
DAY ONE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE NOT ONLY
ALLIANCE MEMBERS, I THOUGHT WE
WERE FRIENDS.
 I THINK THE BEST THING WOULD
BE TO GET ZEKE.
HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON THAT?
 YEAH.
 ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT THIS GAME IS TIMING IS
EVERYTHING, AND CIRIE AND I, WE
ARE GOOD.
I WANT HER ON MY SIDE VOTING
WITH ME AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE
LIKE ZEKE.
 SHE SAYS ZEKE TOLD ME.
 REALLY?
 YEAH.
I'M JUST LIKE, I WAS SICKENED
WHEN I HEARD THAT
 I'M SICK TO MY STOMACH.
WE HAVE TO VET OUT ZEKE.
I CANNOT...
 IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW?
 HOW DOES HE THINK THIS IS
GOING TO TURN OUT WELL FOR HIM?
 YOU GOT ME.
 WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU?
 VOTE ZEKE
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ZEKE?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
WANT THE BLOW PEOPLE OUT OF THE
WATER?
I WOULDFUL
 THESE IDIOTS ARE LIKE HERDING
CATS OVER HERE.
 I WOULD.
 WE CAN MAKE A DECISION AND
DICTATE TO THEM THIS TIME.
 THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ASS
MOVE.
 WE'RE DOING IT.
 IF YOU STICK WITH US AND YOU
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
 THERE'S NO IF ABOUT IT.
I AM.
 WE'RE TAKING OUT OZZY.
 WE ARE.
 DO YOU LOVE ME?
IT'S OKAY IF PEOPLE THINK I'M
QUIRKY AND YOU CAN UNDERESTIMATE
ME AT YOUR OWN RISK, BUT IF
EVERYBODY LISTENS TO ME, BRAD,
SIERRA, SARAH, TROYZAN, TAI,
WE'RE VOTING FOR OZZY, WE'RE NOT
TELLING EVERYBODY ELSE, WE'RE
GOING TO BLIND SIDE HIM.
 THIS WILL GO OFF AND WE WILL
BE MASSIVE GAME CHANGERS
TONIGHT, LARGELY THANKS TO ME,
AND I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.
I DON'T WANT TO USE IT THIS
EARLY, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I
HAVE THE NUMBERS.
 WE'RE VOTING FOR OZZY AND
WE'RE GOING TO BLIND SIDE HIM.
 AT THIS POINT I AM SITTING IN
THE MIDDLE OF TWO GROUPS THAT
ARE STARTING TO SURFACE.
THERE T ONE GROUP, BRAD, SIERRA,
TROYZAN, TAI, DEBBIE, THEY WANT
TO VOTE OUT OZZY, AND THEN
THERE'S AT GROUP OF CIRIE,
ANDREA, MICHAELA, AUBRY, AND
OZZY, AND THEY WANT TO SEE ZEKE
GO.
I'M WEIGHING OUT ALL MY OPTIONS.
AND TO VOTE OZZY OUT, THAT MEANS
TAKING OUT A BIG SOCIAL AND
CHALLENGE THREAT RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S THE MOVE TO MAKE EARLY ON
IN A MERGE.
BUT THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT
ZEKE OUT BECAUSE HE'S A SMART
GUY AND HE'S WILLING TO MAKE
MOVES.
WHEN YOU TRUST SOMEBODY LIKE
THAT, YOU WILL END UP GETTING
BLIND SIDED.
SO IT'S A REAL TOUGH POSITION TO
BE IN, BUT A LINE WILL BE DRAWN
IN THE SAND THIS VOTE.
IN THE SAND THIS VOTE.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
HALI VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
OZZY PLAYED THIS GAME AS MANY
TIMES AS ANYBODY'S EVER PLAYED
IT.
WHAT'S YOU INNING ABOUT THIS
SEASON?
 FOR SOME REASON THE STAKES
SEEM HIGHER.
EVERYBODY IS TRYING THE PLAY IT
LIKE A SECRET AGENT, ESPIONAGE
BEHIND EVERY COCONUT TREE,
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS THAT
APPEAR AND CAN NEVER BE FOUND
AGAIN OR THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND,
THERE'S JUST MORE OF A
CUT-THROAT MENTALITY THAT
SURFACED.
 Jeff: SARAH, WE'RE ON DAY
24.
WE'VE HAD SO MANY SWITCHES, SO
MANY DIFFERENT TRIBES, IS IT
HARD TO KNOW WHERE THE REAL
RELATIONSHIPS LIE?
 YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS WITH WHO,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL JUST
A BUNCH OF SINGLE PEOPLE WAITING
TO HOOK UP RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO GO ON A
DATE, I'M AVAILABLE.
 OKAY.
COOL.
 Jeff: TAI, IN A GAME THAT
IS THIS CAGEY, WINNING IMMUNITY
BECOMES SO IMPORTANT.
 YEAH.
IT STILL SURPRISED ME.
WHEN I GO FOR A MARATHON, IT'S
ONE FOOT AT A TIME, BUT I JUST
FEEL LIKE I NEED TO DO THIS
MYSELF, ME AGAINST OZZY, NOT ME
AND THE POLE ANYMORE.
 Jeff: OZZY, YOU NEVER LOST
THAT CHALLENGE, YOU LOSE, YOU GO
BACK THE CAMP, YOU GOT THE FEEL
SOME PRESSURE.
 ALWAYS.
YOU JUST TALK TO AS MANY PEOPLE
AS YOU CAN AND YOU GOT TO TRUST
THE PEOPLE THAT SAY YOU CAN
TRUST THEM.
AND I DO HAVE VALUE IN THIS GAME
BECAUSE THERE EIGHT NOTHING TO
EAT AT CAMP.
SO I'M GOING TO BE WORKING MY
ASS OFF TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
STAY FED, AND IT'S A BIG THING
TO BE ABLE TO OFFER, ESPECIALLY
WITH 15 DAYS LEFT.
 Jeff: AUBRY, YOU'VE PLAYED
THE GAME ONCE.
SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS
LIKE.
24 DAYS IN, COULD YOU MAKE IT
WITHOUT PEOPLE CATCHING FISH?
 I HAVE TO SAY, JEFF, THIS IS
MUCH HARDER THAN THE FIRST TIME
I PLAYED.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT EVERYONE
IS CAGEY, IT'S TOUGH, LIKE ALL
THE COCONUTS, THE PROTEIN IS
ONLY COMING IN WHEN OZZY BRINGS
IT IN, AND IT'S NOT JUST
PHYSICAL, IT'S MENTAL, IT'S
MORALE.
I MEAN, I THINK WE'VE ALL KIND
OF SAT AROUND AND GOTTEN
EMOTIONAL AT TIME, AND THAT
AFFECTS EVERYTHING.
 Jeff: SO ZEKE, IN
"SURVIVOR," YOU WANT TO GET TO
THE END, AND YOU WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOU PUT PEOPLE ON THE
JURY THAT WILL VOTE FOR YOU.
IS THAT STILL THE APPROACH TO
TAKE?
 I THINK YOU SORT OF PLAY BY
THE SAME RULES.
YOU THINK, CAN I BEAT THIS
PERSON, CAN I BEAT THIS PERSON?
YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK, DO THEY
THINK THEY CAN BEAT ME?
AND IF I THINK THAT THEY THINK
THAT THEY CAN'T BEAT ME, HOW DO
I LEARN HOW TO ARTICULATE MYSELF
SO THEY THINK THEY CAN BEAT ME.
THAT'S THE TRICKY PART THIS
SEASON, FINDING A WAY TO SAY, I
KNOW YOU GUYS MIGHT BE AFRAID OF
ME FOR THIS REASON OR THAT
REASON, BUT IT'S NOT AN ASSET,
IT'S NOT VALUABLE, IT'S A REASON
WHY YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT ME IN
THE END.
 Jeff: TAI, HAVE YOU NOTICED
A DIFFERENCE FROM THE FIRST TIME
YOU PLAYED UNTIL THIS TIME IN
TERMS OF THE SUBTLETY, THE
NUANCE OF COMMUNICATION IN WHICH
ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR FIRST
LANGUAGE?
 YEAH, IT'S INCREDIBLY
DIFFERENT.
EVERYBODY IS VERY CAGEY.
EVEN RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT IT, WOW, THAT ALL MAKES
SENSE TO ME.
 Jeff: YOU MEAN WHAT ZEKE
JUST SAID?
 EXACTLY.
HE'S INCREDIBLE THE WAY HE SEES
THING, ALL THE DIFFERENT ANGLES,
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO THINK
IT THAT WAY.
 Jeff: ZEKE, WHEN YOU HEAR
ANOTHER PLAYER AT TRIBAL SAY,
HE'S INCREDIBLE, IS THERE A PART
OF YOU WANTING TO GO, OH, NO,
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT RIGHT
BEFORE WE VOTE.
 WELL, I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS
A MOD -- MEHDI COME OF WORRY FOR
SURE.
THERE ARE TIMES I THINK I'M
OKAY.
I HAVE TO HAVE THOSE MOMENTS OF
PEACE BECAUSE OTHERWISE I
COULDN'T MAKE IT 24 DAYS.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, ULTIMATELY
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT STRATEGY,
GAME PLAY.
WHO DO YOU VOTE OUT WHO YOU
THINK WILL VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU
GET TO THE END.
 ABSOLUTELY.
BEING IN THE AIR FORCE
AUXILIARY, WE HAVE TO GATHER
FACTS, COME UP WITH A PLAN,
CARRY IT OUT.
THE DIFFERENCE IS THE PEOPLE
AROUND ME WOULD ALL HAVE MY BAG.
THESE PEOPLE ALL HAVE DAGGERS
DRAWN AIMING FOR MY BACK.
IT'S INSANE.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M WITH.
IT'S CRAZY.
 Jeff: CIRIE, WHAT RAN
THROUGH YOUR MIND TODAY AS YOU
CONTEMPLATED WHO TO VOTE FOR?
WELL, RIGHT NOW WHO DO I THINK
HAS DISPLAYED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF
TRUST TO BELIEVE WHAT THIS
PERSON IS SAYING OR VICE VERSA.
AND THAT'S HOW I'M BASING MY
VOTE TONIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
SIERRA, YOU'RE UP.
 TERRIBLE GAME.
YOU SUCK AT THIS GAME.
I HOPE I SEE YOU NEVER.
 THIS IS JUST TO SPICE THINGS
UP A LITTLE BIT.
 THIS IS JUST TO SPICE THINGS
UP A LITTLE BIT.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
 JEFF, BEFORE YOU DO THAT, SO
WHILE IN EXILE I GAVE UP THE
BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE SO I
COULD HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.
 Jeff: AN THE ADVANTAGE IS?
 AN EXTRA VOTE, SIR.
 Jeff: AND YOU'RE GOING TO
USE IT TONIGHT?
 YES, I AM.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
GO CAST YOUR EXTRA VOTE.
GO CAST YOUR EXTRA VOTE.
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, OZZY.
ZEKE.
SIERRA.
AUBRY.
ONE VOTE AUBRY, ONE VOTE ZEKE,
ONE VOTE SIERRA, ONE VET OZZY.
ZEKE.
TWO VOTES ZEKE.
OZZY.
TWO VOTES OZZY.
ZEKE.
THAT'S THREE VOTES ZEKE.
OZZY.
THREE VOTES OZZY, THREE VOTES
ZEKE.
ZEKE.
FOUR VOTES ZEKE.
OZZY.
FOUR VOTES OZZY, FOUR VOTES
ZEKE.
OZZY.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES OZZY, FOUR
VOTES ZEKE.
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, OZZY.
THAT'S SIX, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK EATING.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 Jeff: WELL, IT'S VERY CLEAR
FROM THE REACTION THAT FOR ALL
THE TALK OF CAGINESS, A PUNCH
WAS JUST THROWN.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME
Captioning funded by CBS
"SURVIVOR," THE GLOVES ARE OFF.
 IT'S ALL SHADY.
WILL I TRUST ZEKE AGAIN?
OF COURSE NOT.
 Jeff: AN ALLIANCE SEEMS
INVINCIBLE.
 NOW THAT WE HAVE SIERRA,
THERE IS A LINE DRAWN IN
CONCRETE.
 Jeff: BUT NOTHING IS SET IN
STONE.
 YOU CAN MAKE A MOVE.
 HELL, YEAH, I WANT THE MAKE A
MOVE.
 I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, BUT
I KNEW IT WAS INEFTDABLE.
I PLAYED MY HARDEST.
I THINK I OVERESTIMATED MY
WORTH.
IF YOU DON'T WIN IMMUNITY AND
YOU DON'T HAVE AN IDOL, YOU'RE
SITTING WHERE I'M SITTING.
"SURVIVOR" AS A WAY OF LIFE,
IT'S CHANGED ME IN WAYS I'LL
NEVER FORGET, AND I'M JUST SO
THANKFUL FOR IT.
