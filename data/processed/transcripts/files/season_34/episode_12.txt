 --- 

         Jeff: HELLO, SURVIVOR FANS!
WE ARE LIVE BACKSTAGE AT CBS IN
LOS ANGELES FOR THE TWO-HOUR,
SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR:GAME
CHANGERS.
HERE THEY ARE, THE GAME CHERNGZ.
YOU KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE
BLEED WHEN MALCOLM WENT OUT
EARLY, SANDRA WAS DETHRONED.
EVEN THIS NUT, TONY, COULDN'T
GET ANY TRACTION.
THIS SEASON HAD SOME OF THE MOST
ENTERTAINING AND RISKY GAME PLAY
EVER, AND THE GOOD NEWS, IT'S
NOT OVER.
MORE HISTORY WILL HAPPEN
TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
ON.








WE HAVE A TWO-HOUR SEASON
FINALE.
WE'RE GOING TO READ THE VOTES.
WE'LL ANNOUNCE THE WINNER.
THEN WE BRING EVERYBODY ON STAGE
FOR THE LIVE REUNION SHOW, AND
THERE IS A LOT TO COVER,
INCLUDING ONE OF THE MOST TALKED
ABOUT MOMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR," WHEN ZEKE WAS OUTED
AS BEING TRANSGENDER.
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR
COMMENTS FOR THE GROUP IT'S NOT
WE HAVE A PACKED HOUSE HERE ON
CBS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THEY ARE READY.
I KNOW YOU ARE.
HERE'S THE DEAL-- SIX PEOPLE
LOWEST.
TAI HAS PATIENTLY HELD ON TO TWO
IDOLS.
TROYZAN HAS AN IDOL.








SARAH HAS THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
IT'S A LOT OF GAME-CHANGING
POWER STILL LEFT IN THE GAME.
AND ONCE AGAIN, WE GO INTO A
FINALE STILL VERY UNCERTAIN WHO
WILL TAKE HOME THE TITLE OF
SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION
DOLLARS.
HERE IT IS, THE SEASON FINALE OF
"SURVIVOR"!
 Jeff: FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER, WE BROUGHT 20 OF
"SURVIVOR'S" BIGGEST GAME
CHANGERS TO FIJI TO BATTLE
AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 YOU GOTTA GO BIG OR GO HOME.
 WOOOO!
 Jeff: THE GAME PLAY STARTED
EARLY.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR SPY SHACKS.
THEY AIN'T GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
AS THEY REVOLUTIONIZINGED
"SURVIVOR" AGAIN.
WITH BOLD MOVES.
WILD GAME PLAY--
 I WAS LOYAL TO YOU COMPLETELY
AND YOU CRUSHED MY HEART!
IT'S FRUSTRATING, AND I'M
PISSED!
 Jeff: AND UNFORGETTABLE
TRIBAL COUNCILS.
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
HERE, JEFF?
 Jeff: OH, MY GOSH!
WHERE RISKY IDOL PLAYS--
 I'M GOING TO GIVE THE IDOL TO
PRETTY LADY.
 I'M GOG VOMIT.
 Jeff: EPIC FACE-OFFS...
J.T.
 DAMN.

 Jeff: AND RAW EMOTION.
 I DIDN'T WANT TO BE, LIKE,
THE TRAN "SURVIVOR" PLAYER.
I WANT TO BE ZEKE THE "SURVIVOR"
PLAYER.
 ARE YOU.
 I FEEL LIKE I AM.
 YOU ARE.
 Jeff: ALL LEADING TO A SLEW
OF DEVASTATING BLINDSIDES.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
AND AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 THERE IS A RAT IN THIS GROUP,
SO I AM GOING TO STEAL SARAH'S
VOTE.
 WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'S MY
ADVANTAGE.
IT'S NONTRANSFERABLE.
IT SAYS IT ON THE BOTTOM.
 Jeff: CIRIE, SARAH IS THE
ONLY PERSON WHO CAN USE THAT
ADVANTAGE.
A FOILED ATTEMPT BY CIRIE TO
FLIP THE GAME UPSIDE DOWN
RESULTED IN MORE CHAOS.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?
I AM GOING TO USE MY ADVANTAGE.
 Jeff: WHOSE VOTE ARE YOU
GOING TO STEAL?
 I'M GOING TO TAKE TAI'S.
 Jeff: AND MICHAELA WAS SENT
TO THE JURY.
MICHAELA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
LEAVING EVERYONE SCRAMBLING FOR
A SEAT IN THE FINAL THREE.
NOW, ONLY SIX REMAIN.
SARAH, SINCE THE MERGE, SHE HAS
PLAYED AN AGGRESSIVE GAME,
BOUNCING FROM ONE ALLIANCE TO
ANOTHER TAKING OUT ANYONE
STANDING IN HER WAY.
 YOU'RE MY, LIKE, "IT" GIRL
OUT HERE.
 Jeff: SIERRA.
 I WILL BE GIVING IT TO SARAH.
 IT WORKED.
 Jeff: WITH THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE GUARANTEEING HER A
SPOT IN THE FINAL FIVE, SHE IS
IN A POWER POSITION TO SHIFT THE
GAME AGAIN.
 I DESERVE TO BE A GAME
CHANGER.
I DIDN'T LEAVE MY SON FOR 39
DAYS TO NOT WIN $1 MILLION.
 Jeff: TROYZAN, FOR WEEKS,
HE HAS QUIETLY PLAYED FROM THE
BOTTOM.
 OH, MY GOD!
 GOOD JOB, GUYES.
 Jeff: BUT WITH A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL INSTILL HIS
POCKET, AND ALLIANCES IN
TURMOIL, THE TIMING MAY BE RIGHT
FOR TROYZAN TO MAKE A MOVE.
 WHEN EVERYTHING IS NOT
LOOKING YOUR WAY, THERE IS
SOMETHING ALWAYS IN YOU,
TROYZAN, THAT IS GOING TO CLICK
AND SAY, "NEVER GIVE UP.
YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH
ANYTHING."
 Jeff: TAI, HIS UNCANNY
ABILITY TO FIND HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS--
 HOLY COW!
"SURVIVOR" GODS REALLY LOOKED AT
ME.
 Jeff: ...AND HIS PATIENCE
TO NOT PLAY THEM LEAVES TAI IN A
POWERFUL POSITION WITH TWO IDOLS
AND ONLY THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS
REMAINING.
 I'M NOT AFRAID TO MAKE BIG
MOVES.
YOU WANT TO MAKE BIG MOVES, YOU
HAVE TO TAKE THE BULL AND OWN
IT.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER.
HIS SOCIAL GAME WAS DOMINANT
EARLY.
 YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR GAME.
ARE YOU IN IT FOR HIM OR YOU?
 Jeff: BUT SINCE MERGE, HE
HAS BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF
THE NUMBERS.
 EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD TO VOTE
CULPEPPER.
 YEAH.
 I HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITY FOR ME
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ANOTHER
DAY.
 Jeff: WITH NO IMMUNITY
IDOLS OR ADVANTAGES, WINNING
CHALLENGES MAY BE OF THE ONLY
WAY CULPEPPER CAN MAKE IT TO THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 PLAYING "SURVIVOR," YOUR
GUARD IS ALWAYS UP.
AND IF YOU RELAX, IF YOU NAP ON
THE JOB, YOU'RE GOING HOME.
 Jeff: AUBRY-- IT'S BEEN
ANOTHER SEASON OF HIGHS AND LOWS
FOR THIS STRATEGIC FORCE.
AUBRY HAS IT!
 IT REALLY FELT GREAT AT THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WINNING.
BUT HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANDREA, SO, NATURALLY, SHE'S
KILLED OFF TOO,.
 Jeff: BUT SHE IS ONCE AGAIN
WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE
END.
CAN AUBRY FIND HER WAY BACK TO
THE FINAL THREE OR WILL SHE BE
VOTED OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
HER "SURVIVOR" CAREER.
 I'M IN DEEP DOO-DOO, BUT
THAT'S THE AUBRY WAY-- ALWAYS
HANGING ON BY THE SKIN OF MY
TEETH.
 Jeff: CIRIE, THIS
"SURVIVOR" LEGEND AND PERENNIAL
FAN FAVORITE HAS ONCE AGAIN
RELIED ON SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
AND SAVVY GAME PLAY.
 TAI SEES SARAH AS A THREAT.
 I NEED TO GET TAI COMFORTABLE
ENOUGH TO TRUST ME.
 I CAN BELIEVE YOU?
 WHEN YOU SEE ME STAND UP AND
PLAY THAT ADVANTAGE, YOU STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE ME?
 OKAY.
 Jeff: IN HER FOUR SEASONS,
CIRIE HAS NEVER FOUND AN IDOL OR
WON AN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
 YOU GOT IT, CIRIE.
 Jeff: BUT WITH THE MILLION
DOLLARS ONCE AGAIN IN SIGHT, IS
THIS WHEN IT FINALLY ALL COMES
TOGETHER?
 TO STAY IN THIS GAME AT THIS
POINT, YOU HAVE TO SEE
EVERYTHING.
AND IF YOU SKIP OVER THE PICTURE
THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN THE
ROAD, IT WILL GET YOUR TORCH
EXTINGUISHED.
TRUST ME.
I KNOW.
 Jeff: WITH SIX
GAME-CHANGING PLAYERS, THREE
IDOLS, AND THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE
STILL IN PLAY, THE STAGE IS SET
FOR A WILD AND HISTORIC FINISH.
WHO WILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, AND OUTLAST ALL
THE REST TO WIN THE MILLION
DOLLARS AND THE TITLE OF "SOLE
SURVIVOR."
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
 ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO KNOW WHO
THE RAT WAS.
 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT DID
MICHAELA DO?
 NOTHING.
 SO IT WAS JUST RANDOM--
 I FELT BETRAYED BY CIRIE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL PLAYING MY "STEAL
A VOTE."
SO I TARGETED MICHAELA BECAUSE
MICHAELA IS CIRIE'S RIGHT-HAND
MAN.
BUT NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO I CAN
TRUST.
FORTUNATELY, I STILL HAVE THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE, WHICH CAN BE
PLAYED AT SIX.
SO I KNOW I'M SAFE.
THAT WAS MY ADVANTAGE TO USE,
NOT YOURS.
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE MY VOTE?
 BECAUSE TAI SAID, "SARAH,
SHE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT."
IF SOMEBODY SAYS YOUR NAME, YOU
NEED TO GO--
 CIRIE, YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT THIS.
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN AN
ALLIANCE TOGETHER.
I WANTED TO USE THAT AT ANOTHER
TIME AND NOW I CAN'T BECAUSE OF
YOU.
 THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS TRUE.
I'M IN A LOT OF TROUBLE RIGHT
NOW.
SARAH IS REALLY PISSED AND
THINKS I'M TRYING TO PULL AN
OKEY-DOKE ON HER.
IT FELT LIKE, "WHOA.
I'M TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR."
BUT AS THE SAYING GOES, "NO GOOD
DEED GOES UNPUNISHED."
HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOMETHING TO
BE SAVED, SALVAGED.
I DON'T KNOW.
 I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE RAT
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EXPOSED?
 HONESTLY?
 YEAH.
 I FELT THAT TAI WAS PLAYING
YOU, ME, AND THEM.
 NOPE.
 AUBRY, YOU KNOW.
YOU'VE BEEN A PART OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS.
TAI SAID THIS WE SHOULD GET
SARAH OUT.
SO I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE
ADVANTAGE.
NOW, I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT MY
ADVANTAGE?
 I JUST FOUND THAT OUT.
 JUST FOUND IT OUT WHEN?
OBSERVER WE WENT TO TRIBAL.
 TONIGHT.
 DID YOU TONIGHT, BEFORE WE
LEFT.
 NO.
 OH, MY GOD!
 TAI, ARE THE ONE THAT THREW
MY NAME OUT THERE?
JUST ANSWER THAT HONESTLY TO ME.
WAS IT YOU?
 I DID SAY THAT.
I JUST SAID THEORETICALLY WHO IS
THE BIGGEST THREAT?
 YOU WERE GOING TO VOTE ME OUT
TONIGHT.
 YES BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME--
 I APOLOGIZE.
 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU
THIS--
 I APPROXIMATION.
 I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANYMORE
RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE GOING TO (BLEEP) VOTE ME
OUT TONIGHT!
I PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE FOR
YOU, AND I WOULD HAVE GONE HOME
TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK.
SO I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANYMORE.
 SHE SET ME UP--
 NO, TAI.
 WITH YOU.
 THEN WHY WOULD YOU VOTE ME
OUT?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I PANICKED.
LAST TIME I PLAYED I DIDN'T DO
ANY LYING, DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
AND THIS TIME I SAID THIS IS
"GAME CHANGER."
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT.
I FELT LIKE I WAS DOING WHAT
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS DOING ANYWAY
BUT I GOT CAUGHT.
NOW I AM "TAI THE LIAR."
I THINK I SCREWED UP MY GAME.
NOW MY OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.
LUCKILY, I STILL HAVE TWO IDOLS
THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT.
MAYBE I CAN USE THEM TO GAIN
TRUST?
I NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE TO LEAN
ON.
 I FOUND ONE HERE.
 AND FOUND ONE... I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU AND SARAH AT THE
SAME TIME.
 DON'T TELL SARAH.
 I'M NOT, I'M NOT.
SHE'S SO PISSED OFF.
I'M NOT.
I'M WITH YOU NOW.
 OKAY, OKAY.
 I'LL PLAY IT TODAY, PLAY IT
TOMORROW WITHOUT TELLING YOU,
BUT I FEEL I OWE YOU THAT.
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
WITH IT.
 JUST HOLD ON TO IT FOR RIGHT
NOW.
TAI'S WHOLE GAME HAS IMPLODED.
HE GOT CAUGHT IN A WEB OF LIES.
HE FELT SO BAD THIS MORNING HE
WANTED TO MAKE AMENDZ WITH ME
AND TOLD ME HE HAD TWO IDOLS.
NOW, DO I REALLY BELIEVE HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T TRUSTED TAI SINCE HE
VOTED OUT SIERRA.
I CAN HELP HIM GET FURTHER IN
THE GAME, BUT I HAVE TO HAVE
COLLATERAL.
YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING I'M
YOUR KEY.
 YES.
 DON'T FALL INTO ANY TRAP.
 I'M NOT.
 WE'LL KEEP IT LOCKED.
I MANIPULATED HIM ON THE FIRST
ONE, AND I'M GOING TO MANIPULATE
HIM ON THESE TWO AS WELL.
IES LIED TO ME NUMEROUS TIMES.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM THROWING HIM
UNDER THE EXPWUS VOTING HIM OUT
WITH HIS OWN IDOL.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
 Jeff: DAY 36, SIX PEOPLE
LEFT.
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY' TODAY'S I
CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CULPEPPER, TAKE IT BACK.
THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE THROUGH A GIANT
MAZE, COLLECTING THREE BAGS OF
PUZZLE PIECES ALONG THE WAY.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR BAGS,
YOU'LL USE THE PIECES INSIDE TO
SOLVE A COMPASS ROSE PUZZLES.
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 15th
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND BECOME THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF
OUR JURY.
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.
 WOW.
 OH!
 Jeff: THE WINNER WILL HAVE
DELIVERED TO THEM AT CAMP
CHICKEN PARM.
 OH, MAN!
 Jeff: SPA GET WEMEAT SAUCE.
GARLIC BREAD, AND KEY LIME PIE.
 DAMN.
 Jeff: FOR DESSERT.
 A LITTLE FLORIDA.
 Jeff: READY TO PLAY?
WE'LL DRAW SPOTS AND GET IT ON.
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
FIVE, AND A NICE REWARD.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS
MAZE.
TROYZAN, AUBRY, AND SIERRA ARE
WORKING ONE SIDE.
CULPEPPER, TAI, AND SARAH
WORKING THE OTHER.
YOU HAVE THREE BAGS TOTAL THAT
YOU HAVE TO COLLECT FROM YOUR
SIDE.
THAT'S IT.
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS,
YOU START WORKING ON THAT
PUZZLE.
TROYZAN AT HIS FIRST STATION,
CULPEPPER HEADING TO HIS FIRST
STATION.
TAI RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.
TROYZAN HAS HIS FIRST BAG.
HE'S HEADING BACK.
CULPEPPER COMING BACK WITH HIS
FIRST BAG.
CULPEPPER TAKES A BIG FALL!
TAI RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
TAI FATHER DOWN NOW!
TROYZAN IS BACK WITH HIS FIRST
BAG.
CULPEPPER COMING BACK WITH HIS
FIRST BAG.
TAI RIGHT BEHIND HIM, LITERALLY
JUST FOLLOWING THE PATH THAT
CULPEPPER IS LEGEND.
CULPEPPER DROPS HIS FIRST, HEADS
BACK OUT.
TAI HEADING BACK OUT FOR HIS
SECOND BAG.
AUBRY HAS HER FIRST BAG.
CIRIE NOW HAS HER FIRST BAG.
SARAH HAS HER FIRST BAG.
SHE'S HEADING BACK.
AFTER 36 DAYS, WHO WANTS IT
MORE?
CIRIE RIGHT ON AUBRY'S TAIL NOW.
SARAH HAS HER FIRST.
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER SECOND.
TROYZAN IS IN THE LEAD.
HE HAS THAT SECOND BAG.
CULPEPPER AT THE SECOND STATION.
AND ONCE AGAIN, TAI IS JUST
TRYING TO FOLLOW CULPEPPER.
AUBRY UNTYING THAT SECOND BAG.
SHE'S HEADING BACK NOW.
TROYZAN DROPS HIS SECOND BAG.
BUT HE DROPPED IT AT THE WRONG
PUZZLE.
 I'M COLOR BLIND.
 I'LL TAKE IT!
 Jeff: CULPEPPER BACK WITH
HIS SECOND BAG.
HE HAS DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM
TAI.
IT IS AUBRY, TROYZAN, CULPEPPER,
AND TAI ALL LOOKING FOR THEIR
THIRD AND FINAL BAG AS SARAH AND
CIRIE HEAD BACK WITH THEIR
SECOND.
SARAH LOOKING LOST IN THAT MAZE.
AUBRY TRYING TO GET TO THAT
THIRD STATION.
AND SHE'S DONE IT!
AUBRY HAS HER THIRD BAG.
SHE STARTS UNTYING.
AUBRY HAS HER THIRD BAG.
SHE'S HEADING BACK.
CULPEPPER'S NOW RACING BACK WITH
HIS THIRD BAG.
SARAH BACK OUT NOW.
CULPEPPER WILL BE BACK FIRST.
HE CAN START WORKING ON THAT
PUZZLE.
AUBRY RIGHT BEHIND CULPEPPER.
HERE COMES CIRIE.
IT IS CULPEPPER, CIRIE,
OCTOBERRY, AND TROYZAN WITH THE
EARLY LEAD WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLES.
HUGE STAKES, GUARANTEED
CERTAINTY TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
THERE ARE 41 PIECES IN THIS
PUZZLE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT
WHERE THEY GO.
TAI BACK WITH HIS THIRD BAG.
SARAH COMING BACK WITH HER THIRD
BAG.
36 DAYS IN.
YOU WANT TO GET TO 37, YOU WILL
MOST DEFINITELY EARN IT.
A LOT OF THESE PIECES REQUIRE
ANOTHER PIECE OR TWO.
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
THEY GO, REMEMBER, AND THEN FIND
THE SUPPORTING PIECE THAT GOES
WITH IT.
RIGHT NOW IT IS CULPEPPER AND
AUBRY WITH THE MOST PIECES
PLACED.
SARAH'S GOT A COUPLE OF PIECES
IN THERE.
SLOW GOING FOR TAI RIGHT NOW.
BOTH CIRIE AND TROYZAN TAKING A
DIFFERENT APPROACH, STUDYING
THEIR PIECES FIRST.
SARAH WORKING METHODICALLY.
NOW CULPEPPER PULLING PIECES
OUT, TRYING TO REARRANGE THEM.
IT IS DIFFICULT.
BUT ONCE YOU START TO FIGURE OUT
HOW THIS PUZZLE WORKING, YOU CAN
GET ON A ROLL.
CULPEPPER WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
SARAH WITH ANOTHER PIECE.
AUBRY STARTING TO FALL BEHIND.
TAI STRUGGLING.
TROYZAN TRYING TO GET IN ON
THIS.
CIRIE HAS YET TO PLACE A SINGLE
PIECE.
CULPEPPER DOWN TO 12 PIECES
LEFT.
SARAH SLOWLY, PIECE BY PIECE,
GAINING ON BRAD'S LEAD.
BUT IT'S SARAH AND CULPEPPER
RIGHT NOW BATTLING IT OUT FOR
IMMUNITY.
CULPEPPER NOW DOWN TO SIX PIECES
LEFT.
SARAH TRYING TO CATCH UP.
CAN SHE DO IT?
CULPEPPER REWORKING IT NOW.
SARAH LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT
PIECES.
CULPEPPER DOWN TO HIS LAST PIECE
BUT SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.
 I'M MISSING PIECES.
NO WONDER.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER NOW
SEARCHING BAGS FOR A MISSING
PIECE.
AND IT'S BEEN IN HIS BAG THE
ENTIRE TIME.
WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
CAN SARAH CATCH CULPEPPER?
CULPEPPER ADDS ANOTHER.
CULPEPPER DOWN TO HIS LAST TWO
PIECES.
IT WOULD BE HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.
 GOT IT, JEFF.
 Jeff: HE DOES.
CULPEPPER WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY AND REWARD!
 WOW.
 Jeff: GUARANTEED A SPOT IN
THE FINAL FIVE.
 HOLY...
 PRETTY GOOD FOR A DUMB JOCK.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, COME ON
OVER.
( APPLAUSE )
FOR THE THIRD TIME, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.
IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE WON
REWARD.
CHOOSE ONE PERSON THAT WILL JOIN
YOU AT CAMP TO ENJOY THIS MEAL.
 TROY.
 Jeff: DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE
WITH TROYZAN.
 HE HASN'T BEEN ON ANYTHING IN
A LONG TIME.
 Jeff: TROYZAN GOING TO
ENJOY THE MEAL TONIGHT.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 Jeff: CHOOSE ONE MORE
PERSON.
EVERYBODY HUNGRY.
BIG DECISION BECAUSE YOU ARE
CHOOSING ONE PERSON TO EAT WITH
YOU AND THREE THAT WILL NOT.
 SARAH.
 Jeff: SARAH, COME ON OVER.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
YOU GUYS ARE ALL GOING BACK TO
CAMP.
FOOD WILL BE DELIVERED FOR YOU
THREE.
AFTER YOU EAT, I WILL SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 15th
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND BECOME THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF
THE JURY.
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.
CONGRATS.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, GUYS.
SEE YOU GUYS AT TRIBAL.
 GIVEN THE DRAMA THAT HAPPENED
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, I'M
NOT REALLY SURE WHERE I STAND
WITH PEOPLE.
AND THIS REWARD IS WHAT I
NEEDED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO IS
WILLING TO GO TO THE END WITH
ME.
AND I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER I
HAVE TO DO TO SOLIDIFY MY SPOT.
 I CANNOT EVEN TELL YOU HOW
GOOD THIS TASTES.
THE FACT THAT BRAD WON IS JUST
OUTSTANDING.
BRAD AND I, WE'RE AS SOLID AS IT
GETS.
SO IF HE WINS, I WIN.
AND I HAVE AN IDOL WHICH I CAN
PLAY EITHER TONIGHT OR THE NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHICH MAKES ME
FEEL SAFE.
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD
PLACE.
BUT WE'VE GOT STUFF TO DO.
WE HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITIES.
WE HAVE TO PLAY IMMUNITY IDOLS.
WE HAVE TO BE SMART.
AMAZING VICTORY.
 THANK YOU, BRAD.
 LET'S DO THIS THING.
 I'VE GOT THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE, AND NOBODY KNOWS
ABOUT IT.
SO I'M LUCKY THAT I'M SAFE
TONIGHT.
BUT AT THIS POINT, I HAVE TO GO
WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA TAKE
ME TO THE END.
I FELT BETRAYED BY CIRIE AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND TAI, I
CLEARLY CAN'T TRUST HIM.
SO THE ONLY CHOICE I HAVE RIGHT
NOW IS TO GO WITH BRAD AND TROY.
WHO DO YOU GUYS WANT TO VOTE
OUT, THOUGH?
 I THINK WE PUT VOTES ON TAI
AND VOTES ON AUBRY.
 I THINK AUBRY IS A BIGGER
IMMUNITY THREAT THAN HIM.
 LET'S ALL THREE VOTE AUBRY.
 OKAY.
 I'M GONNA MAKE HIM PLAY AN
IDOL.
THEN WE'LL GET HIM NEXT.
TAI INFORMED ME THIS MORNING HE
HAS TWO IDOLS.
THAT PUTS TAI IN A POWER
POSITION THAT MAKES ME SUPER
LEERY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HIM FLIP
A COUPLE OF TIMES.
SO I NEED TO GET BACK TO CAMP
AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS ON
THE RIGHT PAGE BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT ANY FUNKY BUSINESS WITH TWO
IDOLS TONIGHT.
 WHAT'S UP?
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE END?
 I WANT TO GO TO THE END.
 OKAY, GOOD.
HERE'S THE PLAN.
AUBRY'S GOING HOME.
OKAY?
 OKAY.
 YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME YOUR
OTHER ONE TO HOLD.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY FUNNY
BUSINESS.
IT'S JUST I NEED A LEAP OF FAITH
FROM YOU BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THINGS HAVE BEEN.
 I KNOW.
BRAD COME BACK, AND HE SAID,
"THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
AUBRY'S GOING HOME, BUT IN ORDER
TO GAIN COMPLETE TRUST FROM ME,
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH IDOLS.
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME ONE."
AND THAT RAISED A LOT OF ALARM.
I SAID DAMN.
I FEEL LIKE A DOG, SOMEONE
LEADING ME.
 YOU WANT TO GO TO THE END,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
 YOU'RE SERIOUS?
 LISTEN, EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL
COUNCIL I HAVE GONE TO HAS NOT
GONE AS I EXPECTED.
AND I'M NOT GOING IN THERE
TONIGHT WITH YOU PLAYING AN IDOL
AND SOMEBODY ELSE PLAYING AN
IDOL, AND IT ALL GOES HAYWIRE.
 WELL, MAYBE YOU DID.
IT'S IN MY HANDS.
YOUR DESTINY NOW IS TONIGHT, AND
THAT'S IT.
YOU'VE DONE THAT.
 BRAD WAS REALLY INTENSE AND
HE CREATED FEAR IN ME.
BUT IF I DO THAT, HE'LL BRING ME
TO THE FINAL THREE.
I SAID, "GREAT, NOW I BELONG
SOMEWHERE."
BUT THE BACK OF MY MIND, I WORRY
IF I GIVE THE IDOL TO BRAD,
HE'LL MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME.
 TWO?
 THE ONLY WAY I'LL BELIEVE IN
YOU IS IF YOU GIVE ME THE SECOND
IDOL.
 I'M PUTTING ALL MY FAITH IN
YOU GUYS.
 JUST GIVE IT TO HIM.
 NOT RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO
THINK THIST THROUGH.
 TAI SHOWED ME HIS TWO IDOLS
AND I'M LIKE HOLY CRAP.
I GUESS IN SOME WAY HE'S
REACHING OUT LIKE, "I WANT TO BE
A TRUSTWORTHY GUY," BUT AT THE
SAME TIME, HE'S STILL ACTING
SKETCHY.
 THE THING IS HE COULD PLAY IT
TONIGHT, HE COULD PLAY IT
TOMORROW.
 HE'S NOT GETTING IT BACK.
I'M GETTING IT.
WE'RE VOTING HIM OUT TOMORROW.
WE'RE MAKING HIM THE FOOL.
 YOU NEED TO HELP ME.
I HAVE AN IDOL.
ACTUALLY I HAVE TWO IDOLS.
I SHOWED IT TO BRAD.
AND HE SAID, I WON'T GO HOME.
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOING
HOME.
AND HE'LL TAKE ME TO THE FINAL.
BUT THE WAY HE'S TELLING ME,
HE'S BULLYING ME INTO IT.
SO TONIGHT PLAY WITH YOU.
 OKAY.
 BUT I TELL YOU--
 ARE YOU BEING STRAIGHT WITH
ME, TAI?
 I'M BEING SO STRAIGHT WITH
YOU.
 I KNOW, I KNOW.
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 CIRIE'S HERE.
 YOU GONNA SHOW HER?
 NO.
 I KNOW, TAI, AFTER
EVERYTHING, IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO
TRUST ME.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
HOWEVER, IF WE DON'T DO
ANYTHING, THEY'RE GOING TO JUST
PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.
AT THIS POINT, SARAH, TROYZAN,
AND BRAD JUST CAME FROM THE
REWARD.
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY
DISCUSSED.
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S TRIBAL, I'D
BE SURPRISED IF THEY WEREN'T
GOING TO COME AFTER ME.
SO I TRIED TO TELL TAI WE NEED
TO PUT ALL OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE
AND COME TOGETHER AND GET ON RID
ONE OF THOSE THREE.
WE CAN'T DO BRAD.
IT'S EITHER SARAH OR TROYZAN.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
I PROMISE I WON'T BETRAY YOU.
RIGHT HAND TO GOD, I PROMISE I
WON'T SCREW YOU, TAI.
THE ONLY THING IS, TAI KNOWS
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO HIM
LAST NIGHT WAS BECAUSE OF ME, SO
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T TRUST ME.
PLEASE, TAI, I'M SORRY--
 GO, GO.
 OKAY, OKAY.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 ONCE AGAIN, I FEEL LIKE MY
LIFE IN THE GAME IS IN TAI'S
HANDS, WHICH KIND OF SUCKS
BECAUSE 10 MINUTES BEFORE
TRIBAL, HE'S HAVING AN EMOTIONAL
BREAKDOWN.
 LIKE WHAT?
 TAI HAS TWO IDOLS.
 HE'S GOT TWO?
 YEAH.
 SO DID HE GIVE BRAD ONE OF
THEM?
 NOT YET.
 I CAN'T DECIDE WHAT TO DO.
BRAD, HE ORDERED ME AROUND.
IT'S LIKE A THREAT.
AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T TRUST
CIRIE AT ALL.
SHE SCREWED ME FIRST.
SO HOW DUMB AM I TO FALL ON
CIRIE'S TRAP?
 ARE WE SURE HE'S GOING TO
VOTE WITH US?
 I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW?
 NOTHING.
 HONESTLY, NOBODY REALLY CARES
ABOUT ME.
THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING FROM
ME.
AND IT'S PAINFUL.
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEED TO TOUGHEN UP.
I'M STILL HERE.
I STILL HAVE TWO IDOLS, AND I
JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
BEST FOR ME.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRUN BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
HALI, OZZY, DEBBIE, ZEKE,
SIERRA, "AN DRAERK AND MICHAELA
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET STRAIGHT
INTO IT.
AUBRY, WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE ON THE
FALLOUT FROM THE LAST TRIBAL?
 THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING
WHEN WE WENT BACK TO CAMP.
IT WAS KIND OF A THERAPY
SESSION, AND WE KIND OF GOT TO
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THINGS WERE.
 Jeff: WHAT CONCLUSION DID
YOU COME TO?
 THAT WE HAD A RAT IN OUR
MIDST.
TAI.
 Jeff: TAI.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU WENT BACK TO CAMP, AND ALL
THE FINGERS ENDED UP POINTING AT
YOU?
 YES.
IT DID.
IT'S A GAME OF LIE AND DECEIT.
EVERYBODY LIES.
EVERYBODY DECEIVES.
BUT SOMEHOW, I WAS THE ONLY BAD
GUY HERE AND I TAKE ALL THE
BLAME.
 BUT YOU WERE GOING TO VOTE ME
OUT!
 NO.
 YOU WERE.
THAT'S A LIE RIGHT THERE.
 BECAUSE CIRIE TOLD ME YOU
WERE TARGETING ME FIRST.
THIS IS A GAME OF DECEIT AND A
GAME OF LYING.
EVERYBODY DOES THAT.
 Jeff: IT SOUNDS LIKE TAI IS
MAKING THE POINT THAT WE WERE
ALL CAUGHT LYING.
WHY AM I THE ONE THAT'S GETTING
THE MOST HEAT?
 THE REASON ALL THE HEAT IS
COMING ON TAI IS BECAUSE HE'S
NOT TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS LIES.
 I THINK THIS IS SO
HYPOCRITICAL.
 IT'S NOT.
I HAVE NOT LIED TO YOU.
 HYPOCRITICAL.
 YOUR WHOLE ALLIANCE WANTED
YOU OUT YESTERDAY.
 Jeff: SARAH, IT'S AN
INTERESTING SITUATION.
THERE'S A GROUP OF SIX.
THREE SHARED A REWARD TODAY.
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT WITH BRAD
CHOICING TROYZAN AND YOU, THAT
THE APPEARANCE WOULD BE THAT THE
THREE OF ARE YOU TIGHT, AND THAT
MIGHT PUSH THESE THREE TO TRY TO
DO SOMETHING?
 I THINK AT THIS POINT, YOU
HAVE FIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE TIGHT.
 Jeff: MEANING EVERYBODY BUT
TAI?
 YEAH.
CLEARLY, YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY
EVERYBODY'S FRUSTRATED WITH TAI
THAT NOBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE
AS TAI RIGHT NOW.
 Jeff: TROYZAN, IS IT LIKELY
THAT TAI COULD RECOVER THIS LATE
IN THE GAME?
 HONESTLY, I SAY NO, LIKE, 90%
NO.
 Jeff: CIRIE, HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN SOMEBODY IN THIS KIND OF A
HOLE BEFORE?
 THIS GAME IS LIKE NO OTHER.
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE IN WORSE HOLES
THAN THIS AND SOMEHOW MAKE IT TO
THE END.
SO I NEVER SAY "NEVER."
 Jeff: SO, TAI, WHERE ARE
YOU RIGHT NOW, EMOTIONALLY, DAY
36?
YOU'VE MADE IT TO SIX.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES RIGHT
NOW.
 THEY ALL SAY I'M DOING ALL
THE LYING.
ON TOP OF THAT, THERE WAS A
CONVERSATION WITH ME ALREADY.
A LOT OF OFFERS, A LOT OF
BRIBES.
LIKE THREATEN.
AS WELL.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
PEOPLE CAME TO YOU AND OFFERED
TO MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU.
 YES.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, ARE YOU
SURPRISED TO HEAR TAI SAY HE WAS
APPROACHED TODAY WITH OFFERS?
 NO, I MEAN, WE'RE LATE IN THE
GAME.
YOU NEED NUMBERS.
SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT SOMEONE
WOULD TRY TO REPAIR SOMETHING
FAIR VOTE.
 Jeff: DOES IT CONCERN YOU?
 BUYER BEWARE IF YOU TRY TO DO
A DEAL WITH TAI.
IT COULD MAYBE BENEFIT YOU OR
BITE YOU IN THE ASS.
 Jeff: TAI, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN
TONIGHT?
 THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS MY
VOTE, WHO I'M WRITING DOWN.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN
TELL.
 Jeff:YOU HOW ABOUT YOU,
CIRIE?
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ABOUT
TONIGHT'S VOTE?
 I FEEL AS CONFIDENT AS THE
PEOPLE AROUND ME THAT I CAN
TRUST.
WHICH IS NOT SAYING A LOT.
 Jeff: WOW.
AUBRY, THIS GAME TRULY IS ALIVE
AND MOVING MOMENT BY MOMENT.
YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
STABLE, AND THEN IT SHIFTS.
 I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN KIND OF
HANGING ON BY THE BOTTOM RUNG,
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP THE FAITH
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
SARAH, YOU'RE UP.
SARAH, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
 JEFF.
I'D LIKE TO PLAY THIS FOR
MYSELF.
 Jeff: OKAY.
AND I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
A RED ONE.
I WOULD LIKE IT PLAY FOR AUBRY.
 Jeff: THANKS, TAI.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: THESE ARE BOTH HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOLS.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR TAI AND
AUBRY, WILL NOT COUNT.
 HEY, JEFF.
THIS IS A SECRET ADVANTAGE WHICH
IS A LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
THIS IS ONLY GOOD FOR RIGHT NOW.
AND I DON'T NEED A SOUVENIR.
SO THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR SARAH WILL
NOT COUNT.
 JEFF.
( LAUGHTER )
 OH!
 OH, MY GOD!
 I'M GOING TO GET ON THE
IMMUNITY TRAIN AND GIVE YOU
THAT, BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE
BEING IN THE FINAL FIVE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS ALSO A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.
ANY VOTES CAST FOR TROYZAN WILL
NOT COUNT.
SO, ANY VOTES CAST FOR TAI,
AUBRY, SARAH, TROYZAN, WILL NOT
COUNT.
YOU COULD NOT VOTE FOR
CULPEPPER.
HE HAD IMMUNITY, WHICH MEANS
CIRIE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
VOTES ARE IN THE URN, BECAUSE
THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN RECEIVE
VOTES...
 IS ME.
 Jeff: IS YOU.
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, NOT A
SINGLE VOTE IN HERE HAS YOUR
NAME ON IT.
THIS IS A HISTORIC TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
MOST IDOLS EVER PLAYED AT A
TRIBAL, THREE.
MOST PEOPLE EVER SAFE AT A
TRIBAL, FIVE.
AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND
DEVASTATING PART OF TONIGHT'S
HISTORY-MAKING TRIBAL FOR YOU,
CIRIE, IS YOU BECOME THE FIRST
PERSON IN 34 SEASONS TO BE VOTED
OUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR
LITERALLY IS NO OTHER CHOICE.
THERE'S NO NEED TO REVOTE.
 WOW.
 Jeff: CIRIE, YOU CAME OUT
HERE 11 YEARS AGO TO PLAY THIS
GAME.
YOU'VE PLAYED IT FOUR TIMES NOW.
YOU FAMOUSLY GOT UP OFF THE
COUCH TO SEE WHAT YOU WERE MADE
OF.
YOU HAD ANOTHER MOMENT THIS
SEASON WHERE YOU CONQUERED A
PERSONAL OBSTACLE.
IF THIS IS THE END OF YOUR
"SURVIVOR" RUN, WHAT IS THE
STORY?
 THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
GRAND EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.
IT CHANGED ME.
I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE ANY OF
THIS STUFF IF I DIDN'T GET OFF
THAT COUCH 11 YEARS AGO.
I WOULD NEVER HAVE MET SO MANY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD SO MANY
AMAZING EXPERIENCES.
SO IT'S BITTERSWEET.
HOWEVER, I'M GOING OUT IN GRAND
STYLE.
IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
AND IT JUST MAKES THIS
EXPERIENCE THAT MUCH MORE
SPECIAL FOR ME.
 Jeff: CIRIE, HOW MANY DAYS
OF "SURVIVOR" HAVE YOU PLAYED
NOW?
 NOT ENOUGH.
 Jeff: CIRIE, I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU HAVE PLAYED EVERY DAY OF
"SURVIVOR" WITH GRACE, AND IT
HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU BE
A PART OF THE "SURVIVOR" FAMILY.
YOU ARE THE 15th VOTED OUT
OF THIS SEASON.
YOU BECOME THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF
THE JURY.
YOU NEED TO GRAB YOUR TORCH.
 SURE.
( APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: CIRIE, YOU WANT TO
SAY IT?
 THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
( LAUGHS )
OH!
THANK YOU, JEFF.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 Jeff: THANK YOU, CIRIE.
 Jeff: WELL, A "SURVIVOR"
LEGEND GOES OUT IN LEGENDARY
STYLE.
YOU HAVE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
FIVE.
BUT THIS GAME IS CLEARLY FAR
FROM OVER.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 IT'S A VERY BITTERSWEET
MOMENT FOR ME.
BUT I'M SO THANKFUL TO HAVE HAD
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I'M GOING TO ENCOURAGE MY BOYS
AND MY FAMILY TO GET OFF THE
COUCH AND LIVE BECAUSE LOOK AT
WHAT YOU MISS OUT ON IF YOU
DON'T TRY.
LOOK OUT, WORLD.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU MIGHT
SEE CIRIE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: WELL, THEY DON'T COME
MUCH CLASSIER THAN CIRIE.
CIRIE, COME OUT HERE.
SO CLOSE, AND ONCE AGAIN, A
UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
COME HERE, GIRL!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOK AT THAT!
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT FEEL
LIKE, A STANDING OVATION?
 UM... WOW.
 Jeff: TAKE IT IN.
YOU'VE GIVEN A LOT.
TAKE SOME BACK.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEAR WHAT SHE
HAS TO SAY.
SO, CIRIE, FIRST, THAT.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING
TO ME THAT I RARELY COMMENT ON
SOMEBODY PERSONALLY IN
"SURVIVOR."
I TRY TO REMAIN NEUTRAL, EVEN
THOUGH PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT'S
NOT TRUE.
BUT WITH YOU, IN THAT MOMENT, IT
WAS UNDENIABLE TO SAY WHAT A
PART OF THIS AND WHAT YOU
REPRESENT.
SO WHAT IS IT LIKETO COME OUT
HERE AFTER A DECADE OF EXPOSING
YOURSELF TO ALL OF YOUR
VULNERABILITIES AND FEEL THAT
LOVE?
 IT'S AMAZING.
I DON'T FEEL WORTHY.
IT'S-- LIFE CHANGING.
IT JUST-- IT TELLS THE WORLD
WHAT A GREAT THING A GREAT GAME
THIS IS, AND WHAT YOU CAN
ACCOMPLISH IF YOU JUST TRY.
THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NEVER
KNOWN CIRIE FIELDES.
 Jeff: I'M GOING TO HUG YOU
NOW.
OH, YOU'RE ONE OF A KIND.
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS,"
SEASON FINALE.
SO FAR FROM OVER.
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, I'LL HAVE
THE VOTES.
ENJOY IT, WOMAN!
TAKE A BOW!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
FIRST THINGS FIRST, FOR THE
THIRD TIME, CULPEPPER OTHER I
WILL TAKE IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO USE PADDLES TO MANEUVER
A BALL THROUGH A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES.
IF THE BALL DROPS, YOU GO BACK
TO THE START AND BEGIN AGAIN.
THE FIRST PERSON TO TRANSFER
THREE BALLS TO THE FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY.
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, GUARANTEED A
SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 16th
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR,"
BECOME THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY.
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.
DEFINITELY A LEARNING CURVE TO
THIS CHALLENGE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DROPPING
BALLS AND STARTING OVER.
THAT'S PART OF IT.
SARAH WORKING ON THAT FIRST
TRANSITION.
SHE'S GOT IT.
CULPEPPER MAKES THAT FIRST
TRANSITION.
TAI IS THROUGH HIS FIRST
OBSTACLE.
SARAH'S THROUGH THAT SECOND
OBSTACLE.
CULPEPPER WORKING AROUND THAT
SECOND OBSTACLE.
TAI NOW HEADING FOR THE SECOND
OBSTACLE.
TAI DROPS.
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.
SARAH NAF GATES THAT THIRD
OBSTACLE.
CULPEPPER RIGHT AT THE THIRD
OBSTACLE.
AUBRY AND TROYZAN STRUGGLING TO
GET OUT OF THE GATE.
 WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?
 Jeff: CULPEPPER NEITHER
THAT FINAL OBSTACLE.
SARAH RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
IT'S CULPEPPER AND SARAH AT THE
SAME SPOT IN THE CHALLENGE.
CULPEPPER MAKES THE FINAL
TRANSITION.
SARAH DOES NOT.
SARAH HAS TO GO BACK.
CULPEPPER NOW VERY CLOSE TO THE
FINISH WITH HIS FIRST BALL.
CULPEPPER DROPS AND HAS HIS
FIRST OF THREE BALLS.
CULPEPPER NOW KNOWS IT IS
POSSIBLE.
HE CAN DO IT.
TAI, AUBRY, TROYZAN TRYING TO
GET SOMETHING GOING.
AUBRY HAVING NO LUCK AT ALL.
SARAH NOW AT THE THIRD OBSTACLE.
CULPEPPER NOW AT THE THIRD
OBSTACLE.
BUT HE'S ON HIS SECOND BALL.
CULPEPPER NAF GATES IT NOW,
HEADING INTO THAT FINAL
OBSTACLE.
SARAH STILL SITTING ON THAT
THIRD OBSTACLE, BALL REALLY
MOVING AND IT DROPS.
SARAH ONCE AGAIN LOSING ALL OF
HER PROGRESS, HAS TO BEGIN
AGAIN.
CULPEPPER VERY CLOSE TO
FINISHING HIS SECOND BALL.
CULPEPPER HAS HIS SECOND BALL.
ONE BALL LEFT FOR IMMUNITY.
IT WOULD BE CULPEPPER'S FOURTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN AND
WOULD PUT HIM WITHIN STRIKING
DISTANCE OF THE "SURVIVOR"
RECORD, WHICH IS FIVE, HELD BY A
VERY SMALL AND ELITE GROUP.
TROYZAN AT THE FOURTH AND FINAL
OBSTACLE.
HE'S GOT TO MOVE.
TROYZAN DROPS.
ALL PROGRESS LOST.
HAS TO START AGAIN.
NOBODY ELSE EVEN CLOSE.
CULPEPPER WORKING HIS WAY UP
THAT FINAL OBSTACLE.
AUBRY JUST GOING TO WATCH NOW.
IT WOULD BE A DOMINATING FOURTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN WITHIN
ONE OF THE RECORD.
CULPEPPER WINS HIS FOURTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR!
 NICE JOB, BRAD.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, COME ON
OVER.
( APPLAUSE )
 THAT WAS FOR MONICA.
 Jeff: WHERE IS THE EMOTION?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THAT ONE WAS FOR HER?
 YEAH, YEAH.
 Jeff: FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.
CULPEPPER IS GUARANTEED A SPOT
IN THE FINAL FOUR.
YOU WILL SEE DAY 38.
AS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, FOR
SOMEBODY, THIS IS THE END.
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 16th
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 THANK YOU.
 BRAD SMOKED US ALL, AND THE
TOUGH PART IS BRAD DOESN'T SEEM
TO REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH ME.
SO I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE GOING
HOME.
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A PITCH TO
SAVE MYSELF, BUT I NEED THE
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW.
 NICELY DONE!
 HOW DID DO YOU THAT?
 I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE IN MY
HOUSE.
I WON MY FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TODAY.
WALKING INTO THOSE CHALLENGES,
I'M SO FOCUSED ON WHAT I'VE GOT
TO DO THAT ALL I THINK ABOUT IS
THE CHALLENGE ITSELF.
BEING A PART OF THE RECORD IS A
SIDE NOTE.
MY EYE OF EYE IS ON THE PRIZE
AND I THINK I'M REALLY CLOSE TO
TAKE THE BELL.
 YOU'RE LOOKING KIND OF GOLDEN
RIGHT NOW, BUDDY.
 THIS IS GONNA BE THE EASIEST
VOTE OF THE WHOLE SEASON.
 WE WANT AUBRY OUT, CORRECT?
 CORRECT.
 OKAY.
 MY ALLIANCE IS SOLID WITH
BRAD AND SARAH IS WITH US AS
WELL.
THAT'S A MAJORITY.
SO WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT AUBRY
NEXT BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO
THE FIENLT TRIBAL COUNCIL
SPEECHES, TAI IS EASIER TO BEAT.
BUT YOU TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN EASY
IN THIS GAME, AND I'LL BE LIKE
THIS.
THIS IS-- ZERO.
NOTHING'S BEEN EASY.
 I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME
VERY CLEAR THINGS IN THIS GAME.
LIKE, IF I'M NOT HIR TOMORROW
AND BRAD WINS IMMUNITY AGAIN,
YOU GUYS HAVE A 50% SHOT OF
MAKING THE FINAL THREE BECAUSE
HE'S KEEPING TROYZAN, NO MATTER.
 IF WE GET RID OF TROY--
 IT MAXIMIZES.
 WE HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN THE
TWO OF US.
IF BRAD WINS THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE TOMORROW HE WILL BE
TAKING TROYZAN TO THE FINALE
WITH HIM.
THEN SARAH AND TAI EACH HAVE A
50% SHOT AT VYING FOR THAT FINAL
SPOT.
IF, HOWEVER, WE MAKE A MOVE
TONIGHT TOGETHER TO TAKE OUT
TROYZAN, THAT LEAVES TWO SPOTS
OPEN.
I DON'T WANT TO BE WIPED OUT BY
THE BOYS.
 I AGREE.
 AFTER WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER
OFF AND ON OR WHATEVER.
THIS IS A CHANCE TO SAY, LOOK,
WE ACTUALLY PULLED IT TOGETHER
WHEN IT MATTERED.
 RIGHT.
I AGREE.
THE STORY OF MY GAME THIS WHOLE
SEASON IS I'M ALWAYS IN THE
MIDDLE.
SO I'VE GOT A DECISION TO MAKE
TONIGHT.
BUT FIRST, I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT I CAN TRUST TAI.
 WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT, YOU AND I?
 WELL, ARE WE?
 YES.
YEAH.
BECAUSE YOU WERE--
 IF YOU KNEW OUT OF ANYONE IN
THIS ENTIRE GAME YOU ARE THE ONE
PERSON THEY CARED ABOUT THE
WHOLE TIME.
AND THAT'S WHY I GOT SO HURT.
 BECAUSE YOU FELT-- YEAH.
 TAI, I'M TELLING YOU, I'VE
HAD YOUR BACK THE WHOLE GAME.
 I KNOW.
 SO GIVE ME WHAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO DO, AND I'LL TELL YOU IF
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT.
 I THINK GET AUBRY OUT.
 IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?
IF YOU WANT TO, I'M OKAY WITH
THAT.
 ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
 YEAH.
 I LOVE AUBRY AS A PERSON.
BUT SHE'S ALSO A REALLY GOOD
PLAYER.
SO SHE'S THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO GO
HOME BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAT HER.
 I'LL SHAKE WITH YOU RIGHT
NOW.
 I'LL SHAKE WITH YOU.
WE'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.
AND WE'RE VOTING OUT AUBRY.
PERFECT.
 TAI, I'LL JUST PUT IT TO YOU
LIKE THIS-- I CONTROL WHO GOES
TO FINAL FOUR.
I DO.
 YES, YOU DO.
 I CAN CONTROL WHO GOES TO
FINAL FOUR.
I GIVE YOU TO TOMORROW, YOU HAVE
TO ASSURE ME FROM HEREON OUT,
YOU'RE VOTING WHATEVER I VOTE.
 OKAY.
 IT'S NOT COMPLICATED.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
 YES.
 OKAY.
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
I BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE VERY SINCERE.
EVERY TIME YOU SAY IT, I BELIEVE
IT.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.
IT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
ARE YOU REALLY GOG HAVE MY BACK
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW NIGHT?
 I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK TONIGHT
AND TOMORROW NIGHT.
 VOTE AUBRY.
 YEAH.
 I'LL SEE WHAT YOU VOTE
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE HERE
TOMORROW.
 BRAD AND I HAPPEN TO WANT THE
SAME THING, BUT THE WAY HE
TALKED TO ME IS, LIKE, I AM THE
MINORITY OR SUBSERVEIANT OR
SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP.
HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR ME.
HE'S INTIMIDATING BIG TIME TO ME
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE GUY.
BRAD AND I TALKED.
HE SAID IF I DON'T WANT TO GO
HOME TONIGHT, I HAVE TO MAKE HIM
A PROMISE.
 OKAY.
 THEY VOTE WHATEVER HE TELL ME
TONIGHT.
AND HE SAID I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO GO WITH HIM PLANS.
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM NOBODY.
WE CAN FLIP ON HIM.
 OKAY.
 AND VOTE FREEWAY ZAHN, WE
FLIP ON HIM TONIGHT.
 TONIGHT IS HUGE.
THIS COULD BE A MILLION-DOLLAR
MOVE.
AND SURE ENOUGH, TAI IS CHANGING
HIS MIND AGAIN AT THE LAST
MINUTE.
TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST
VOTE OF THE GAME.
IT'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHO WILL
BE IN THE FINAL FOUR.
SO TAI AND I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH WAY TO GO.
SO TAI AND I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
HALI.
OZZY.
DEBBIE.
ZEKE.
SIERRA.
ANDREA.
MICHAELA.
AND CIRIE, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GET STRAIGHT
INTO IT.
CULPEPPER'S FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.
TROYZAN, WHAT'S THE FEELING FOR
YOU WHEN YOU SEE IT HAPPENING
AGAIN AND AGAIN?
BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE POINT IN
THE GAME NOW WHERE CULPEPPER
COULD WIN HIS WAY TO THE END.
 YEAH, IT'S TOUGH, YOU KNOW.
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED, YOU
KNOW, I FELT LIKE CHALLENGES
WERE MY DEAL.
AND LOOKING AT THIS GUY JUST
ROMP THROUGH IT LIKE IT'S
NOTHING.
IT'S TOUGH TO SEE AND IT'S, YOU
KNOW, I'M HOPING THAT THE NEXT
CHALLENGE, IF I'M THERE, WILL BE
SOMETHING RIGHT DOWN MY ALLEY.
 Jeff: AUBRY, WHY ARE YOU
SMILING DURING THIS?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CULPEPPER
DOMINATING, AND YOU'RE SMILING.
 I MEAN, THAT'S "SURVIVOR."
SOMETIMES IT'S WITH YOU, AND
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.
 Jeff: WHERE IS IT FOR YOU
TONIGHT?
 I'M DEFINITELY ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.
 Jeff: SO, SARAH, WHAT DOES
THE CONVERSATION CENTER AROUND
WITH FIVE PEOPLE LEFT?
 PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO
SURVIVE ONE DAY AT A TIME RIGHT
NOW.
IT'S KIND OF WHERE THE
CONVERSATION CIRCULATES IS HOW
DO I MAKE IT THROUGH TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL?
 Jeff: SO, TROYZAN, IS
EVERYBODY PITCHING EVERYBODY?
 YEAH, PRETTY MUCH, THAT'S HOW
IT GOES BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE
IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU BASICALLY
NEGOTIATE YOURSELF INTO A FINAL
THREE THING.
 Jeff: AUBRY, THIS REALLY IS
ABOUT FINAL THREE AT THIS POINT.
 IT IS.
AND YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS
AND YOU CAN MAKE SOME LOGICAL
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHERE THINGS
ARE GOING, AND I BELIEVE THAT
BRAD AND TROYZAN WILL BE TWO OF
THE SPOTS IN THE FINAL THREE IF
ONE OF THEM WINS IMMUNITY
TOMORROW.
SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HAVE A
HIGHER CHANCE OF GOING TO THE
END, THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: WHICH WOULD BE VOTING
OUT TROYZAN.
THAT'S ONLY OPTION.
YOU CAN'T VOTE OUT CULPEPPER.
 YES.
 Jeff: TAI DID AUBRY PITCH
THU?
 YEAH.
AUBRY HAS TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT
WITH PERCENTAGE.
IT'S INTERESTING ARGUMENT AND
I'M TAKING THAT INTO
CONSIDERATION.
 Jeff: SARAH, WHAT WOULD BE
THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING WITH
AUBRY'S STRATEGY?
 AT THAT POINT, THAT'S WHERE
YOU HAVE TO START CONSIDERING
WHO YOU'RE WILLING TO PUT ON THE
JURY AND WHO YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SIT NEXT TO.
AND WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ME, WHAT'S
RIGHT FOR AUBRY, WHAT'S RIGHT
FOR TAI COULD ALL BE THE SAME
THING OR THEY COULD ALL BE
DIFFERENT THINGS.
I'M NOT SURE.
 Jeff: TROYZAN ARE, YOU
AWARE THAT THERE'S THIS FEELING
THAT YOU AND CULPEPPER ARE
CONNECTED?
 NOT AS MUCH AS AUBRY SAYS
BECAUSE THAT'S HER OPINION.
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DON'T WIN
IMMUNITY AND THERE'S TWO SPOTS
LEFT WITH ME.
SO, HELLO.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, JUST
BECAUSE YOU HAVE IMMUNITY TODAY
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN SIT ON YOUR
HANDS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE
SURE THAT IF YOU DON'T WIN THE
NEXT CHALLENGE, YOU'VE GOT A
SHOT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, I'VE TALKED TO EVERYBODY
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE TALKED
TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
BUT FROM WHAT I'M HEARING
TONIGHT TSOUNDS LIKE I HAVE TO
WIN TO GET IN.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, ARE THERE
PEOPLE IN THE GAME FOR YOU THINK
IF I GO TO THE END WITH THEM,
I'M NOT SURE I COULD WIN?
 YES.
 Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU, SARA,
PEOPLE YOU ARE CONCERNED YOU
CAN'T BEAT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 Jeff: TAI?
 YUP, DEFINITELY.
 Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU, AUBRY?
 YEAH, THERE ARE PEOPLE I
THINK I CAN'T BEAT.
 Jeff: TROYZAN?
 NO.
 Jeff: SO YOU FEEL
CONFIDENT.
 YES.
 WOW.
 Jeff: SARAH, IT IS
INTERESTING THAT AUBRY'S CASE IS
AGAINST TROYZAN, AND TROYZAN IS
THE ONE GUY THAT SAYS, "I CAN
BEAT ANYBODY HERE IN THIS GAME."
 YOU KNOW, IF TROYZAN FEELS HE
CAN BEAT EVERYBODY HERE, THEN
MAYBE HE'S NOT SOMEONE I WANT TO
GO WITH.
SO IF IT'S ABOUT A FINAL THREE
RIGHT NOW TONIGHT, THEN YOU
BETTER PICK THE RIGHT FINAL
THREE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
AUBRY, YOU'RE UP.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IT FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, AUBRY.
TROYZAN.
ONE VOTE AUBRY, ONE VOTE
TROYZAN.
AUBRY.
TWO VOTES AUBRY, ONE VOTE
TROYZAN.
16th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
AUBRY.
THAT'S THREE UPON.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 Jeff: AUBRY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 THE FULL EXPERIENCE!
 Jeff: YOU CAN LEAVE IT
HERE.
 OH!
 Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL FOUR.
TOMORROW, YOU WILL COMPETE IN
YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
YOU ARE THIS CLOSE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I DECIDE TO NOT BE CAGEY AND
GO FOR BROKE IF TRIBAL, BUT
"SURVIVOR" HAS TAUGHT ME YOU
CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING, AND I
GAVE IT MY BEST SHOT.
AND I TOOK EVERYTHING THAT I
COULD FROM THE EXPERIENCE.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE ON THE
JURY.
I'M SO FREAKING EXCITED TO WATCH
THESE PSYCHOPATHS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
READY TO GET TO YOUR FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES.
 YES.
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CULPEPPER, FOR THE FOURTH TIME,
I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

OBSTACLE AND DOWN A GIANT WATER

IT IS TAI, CULPEPPER, AND SARAH.
TROYZAN NEEDS TO GET LUCKY
QUICKLY AND FIND THE RIGHT KEY
FAST IF HE'S GOING TO BE IN
THIS.
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, ALL
THE MARBLES, RIGHT HERE.
TROYZAN HAS HIS THIRD BAG.
HE'S BACK IN THIS!
EVERYBODY IS IN THIS.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT IN THE
FINAL CHALLENGE OF "SURVIVOR,"
EVERYBODY COMPETING FOR THE WIN.
TAI HAS HIS FIRST PIECE.
CULPEPPER HAS HIS FIRST PIECE.
CULPEPPER HAS HIS SECOND PIECE.
TROYZAN LOOKING FOR THE FIRST
PIECE, AND HE'S GOT IT.
CULPEPPER WITH THE THIRD PIECE.
SARAH JUST LOOKING TO GET ON THE
BOARD.
CULPEPPER WITH HIS FOURTH PIECE.
TAI WITH HIS SECOND PIECE.
CULPEPPER WITH HIS FIFTH PIECE.
HE TOOK THE LEAD AT THE VERY END
AND DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE IT UP
NOW.
TAI WITH THE THIRD PIECE.
SARAH STILL STRUGGLING.
NOW HE'S GOT ONE AS CULPEPPER
ADDS ANOTHER.
TAI WITH HIS FOURTH PIECE.
SARAH ADDS A PIECE.
CULPEPPER DOWN TO HIS LAST
PIECE.
HE JUST NEEDS THE TOP.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO UNTIE YOUR
THREE NUMBER TILES AND USE THEM
TO SOLVE A COMBINATION LOCK.
THAT HOLDS THE TOP OF THE
LIGHTHOUSE, SO YOU ARE CLOSE,
BUT NOT THERE YET.
TAI WITH A FIFTH PIECE.
TAI IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A
SHOT RIGHT NOW AT CATCHING
CULPEPPER.
CULPEPPER HAS IT.
HE'S GOT THE TOP!
FOR THE WIN.
CULPEPPER WINS HIS FIFTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED
A SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL!
WHERE HE WILL GET A CHANCE TO
PLEAD HIS CASE FOR THE MILLION
DOLLARS AND THE TITLE OF "SOLE
SURVIVOR."
CULPEPPER, COME ON OVER.
 MY OLD FRIEND.
 Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS YOURS.
A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT THINGS.
WITH THIS WIN, YOU JOIN A VERY
SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
WON FIVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES IN A SINGLE SEASON.
THE BIGGER NEWS, WITH THIS WIN,
YOU ARE GUARANTEED AWE SPOT AT
THE FINAL TRIBAL.
ONE BIG DECISION LEFT IN THIS
GAME-- WHO WILL GO TO THE FINAL
THREE WITH YOU, AND WHO WILL
BECOME THE TENTH AND FINAL
MEMBER OF OUR JURY, THEIR DREAM
FALLING THIS SHORT.
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
SEE YOU GUYS TONE AT TRIBAL.
CONGRATS.
 AFTER WINNING FIVE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES I'M CLEARLY IN
CONTROL OF THIS GAME.
I'M IN THE FINAL THREE, AND
QUITE FRANKLY, I THINK I CAN
BEAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
BUT BUT AS FOR TONIGHT, TAI HAS
BETRAYED ME THIS GAME AND SO
HE'S GOING HOME AND IT'S GOOD TO
BE THE KING.
( LAUGHTER )
 OH, MY GOD.
 DID YOU IT!
 OH, MY GOD.
 HE WAS PRETTY CLOSE, THOUGH.
 HE DID A LOT BETTER THAN I
THOUGHT HE WOULD.
 I KNOW.
>. I KNEW I WAS GOING TO WIN
THAT CHALLENGE.
I WAS SO PREPARED MENTALLY, THAT
IN MY HEAD I HAD ALREADY WON IT
BEFORE I STARTED, AND THIS
NECKLACE MAKES ME BULLETPROOF.
I'M GOING TO THE FINAL THREE AND
IT'S MY DECISION WHO IS GOING
HOME AND IT COMES DOWN TO WHO
HAS DONE ME WRONG THE MOST.
AND THAT WOULD BE TAI.
 I THINK WE SHOULD JUST TELL
HIM.
JUST LET HIM DOWN EASY.
 NO, NO.
 NO?
 NO.
 IT'S MY ISLAND RIGHT NOW.
 OKAY, I'M JUST THROWING IT
OUT THERE.
 I KNOW.
BUT I'D RATHER HIM THINK HE'S
GOT SOME GLIMMER OF HOPE, AND
I'M GOING TO LET HIM DOWN AT
TRIBAL.
HE'S DONE NOTHING BUT BACKSTAB
ME THIS WHOLE GAME.
I SAID, "BUDDY, GIVE ME AN IDOL
AND WE'LL GO TO THE END."
HE DID NOT GIVE ME THE IDOL.
HE PLAYED THAT.
 WERE YOU GOING TO FULFILL
THAT?
 NO.
 YOU'RE GOING IN AND SARAH IS
GOING IN.
AS FAR AS JURY IS CONCERNED,
AFTER WINNING FIVE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES, I KNOW I CAN BEAT
BOTH TROYZAN AND SARAH, BECAUSE
AFTER FOOTBALL, I BECAME A TRIAL
ATTORNEY, SO I THINK I CAN SELL
MY CASE BETTER TO THE JURY.
I'M IN CONTROL, AND TAI IS GOING
TO GET WHAT HE DESERVES.
 I KNOW.
ONE OF US IS GOING HOME.
 YEAH.
RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE MOST
OBVIOUS, LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS
BRAD WILL VOTE ME OUT FOR
BETRAYING HIMSELF SO MANY TIMES
AND NOW MY LIFE'S ON THE LINE.
I HAVE TO COME UP WITH
SOMETHING.
OTHERWISE, ALL THIS WAS FOR
NOTHING.
 IT'S WHOEVER THOSE WHO VOTE
FOR.
 YEAH.
 YOU WANT TO BET THAT OR DO
YOU WANT TO TAKE A 50-50 CHANCE?
 HOW?
 MAKE FIRE.
YOU AND I VOTE FOR TROY.
I THINK YOU CAN TAKE TROY DOWN.
I CAN TAKE TROY DOWN.
AT FIRE.
AND WE BOTH GO TO FINAL
TOGETHER.
 BRAD AND TROYZAN HAVE BEEN
TIGHT THE ENTIRE GAME, SO,
CLEARLY, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A
MOVE AGAINST ME OR TAI.
SO HE SAID LET'S VOTE FOR
TROYZAN, AND FORCE A TIE, WHICH
WOULD COME DOWN TO A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE.
I HAVE TO CONSIDER IT.
EVEN THOUGH IT SCARES THE CRAP
OUT OF ME.
I'M NOT SUPER GOOD AT FIRE.
 I DON'T THINK TROYZAN IS VERY
GOOD AT MAKING FIRE.
 YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.
 I THINK WE CAN DO IT.
 BRAD'S PRETTY COCKY RIGHT NOW
AND THINKS HE'S CALLING THE
SHOTS.
BUT I'M THINKING, SCREW THAT.
IF I CAN WIN A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE, I CAN DECIDE WHO'S
GOING TO THE FINAL THREE.
 THE JURY HATES ME.
THEY DO.
BECAUSE I APPEAR LIKE A LIAR.
I JUST HAVE THAT FEELING.
LIKE THEY DON'T THINK I'M A GOOD
PLAYER.
 YEAH.
TAI'S TELLING ME THAT HE CAN'T
WIN.
BUT HE'S MADE MOVES AND FOUND
THREE IDOLS.
SO HE HAS A RESUME.
HOWEVER, TAI IS SO ALL OVER THE
PLACE, HE MIGHT HAVE ALIENATED
THE JURY.
AND THEN THERE'S TROYZAN, WHO
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WITHOUT
BRAD'S PERMISSION THIS WHOLE
GAME.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE HASN'T
MADE ANYONE MAD.
AND SANDRA WON TWICE BY NOT
MAKING ANYONE MAD.
HOW DO YOU START-- LIKE, WHAT DO
YOU NEED TO DO?
 SO WHEN YOU MAKE FIRE, MAKE A
NEST.
SHAVE THE FLINT.
 OKAY.
 WATCH THE WIND.
 I THINK I CAN DO IT.
IF I DO THIS AND WIN, I COULD
RACK UP A TON OF POINTS WITH THE
JURY.
BUT I HAVE TO DECIDE IF THIS IS
A RISK THAT I'M WILLING TO TAKE.
IT'S A COIN FLIP, AND I'VE GOT
TO PICK HEADS OR TAILS.
IT'S A COIN FLIP, AND I'VE GOT
TO PICK HEADS OR TAILS.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
HALI.
OZZY.
DEBBIE.
ZEKE.
SIERRA.
ANDREA.
MICHAELA.
CIRIE.
AND AUBRY, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
ALL RIGHT, SO, LAST BIG DECISION
TO BE MADE BY YOU GUYS TONIGHT,
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO SEND OVER TO
THAT JURY AND WHICH THREE WILL
GET TO FACE THE JURY.
CULPEPPER, FIRST,
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR FIFTH INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
WIN.
TELL ME ABOUT THE MOMENT RIGHT
AFTER YOU WON IT.
 IT'S AN AMAZING FEELING WHEN
IT HAPPENED.
I KNOW I'M GUARANTEED A 39th
DAY.
BUT NOW I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHO WE WANT TO PUT ON THE JURY,
SO IT'S THAT-- THAT COULD AFFECT
TOMORROW'S VOTE AND EVERYTHING
ELSE.
 Jeff: SARAH WHEN CULPEPPER
SAYS, "NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHO
TO PUT ON THE JURY," WHO IS THE
"WE?"
 I THINK HE'S IMPLYING HIMSELF
AND TROYZAN, WHICH WOULD LEAVE
TAI AND MYSELF ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.
 Jeff: TAI, DOES THAT RING
TRUE?
 THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT
SARAH AND I ARE AT THE BOTTOM.
ONE OF US IS GOING TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.
BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, OUR
CHANCE MIGHT GO UP.
BECAUSE WE, OBVIOUSLY, CAN'T
VOTE FOR CULPEPPER.
AND IF WE JOIN FORCES WE CAN
VOTE FOR TROYZAN.
 Jeff: AND FORCE A TIE.
 FORCE A TIE.
 Jeff: SO, SARA, DID YOU
GUYS TALK ABOUT IT?
 93, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT COULD
HAPPEN TONIGHT.
 Jeff: WHERE DO YOU SIT WITH
THAT?
BECAUSE YOU'RE WEIGHING A LOT?
FOR ME, PERSONALLY, MY DECISION
IS GOING TO COME FROM WHO
DOIMENT TO SIT WITH IN A FINAL
THREE?
 BUT BOTH OF CUSS GET TO THE
FINAL THREE, YOU KNOW.
IF I WAS SARA, I WOULD SAY,
WELL, YOU CANNOT BE ABSOLUTE
SURE.
I MEAN, CULPEPPER TOLD ME IF I
GAVE HIM ONE OF MY IDOLS FOR HIM
TO HOLD ON TO, THEY COULD BUY
BACK HIS TRUST.
I MEAN, HE JUST THINKS LIKE I'M
SO NAIVE.
I'M LIKE I HAVE A BRAIN.
IT'S COMMON SENSE.
 BUT YOU HAVE NO LEVERAGE.
I'VE GOT THE NECKLACE.
YOU'RE IN THE MINORITY.
I'M GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY.
I'M THROWING YOU A LIFELINE, BUT
NOTHING'S FOR FREE.
 THAT'S FINE.
BUT YOU TREATING ME LIKE A
LITTLE CHILD, LIKE A LITTLE
SIMPLETON, "GIVE MEET IDOL."
 YOU CHOSE--
 I DECIDE ON MY OWN TERM HOW
MY DESTINATION IS.
 Jeff: TROYZAN, THE TOUGH
PART ABOUT TONIGHT FOR YOU IS
YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT IS THE
TRUTH OR PART OF A SCHEME TO
MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE FEEL SAFE
WHEN THEY'RE NOT.
 WELL, YEAH, THIS IS THE FIRST
NEWS I HAVE OF A TIE HAPPENING.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY,
EVERY HOUR, THERE'S BEEN
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPEN.
SO IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE
NORMAL FOR ME TO GO, "WOW"
AGAIN, AND SAY, "OKAY, HERE WE
GO.
BREAK OUT THE STICKS, AND LET'S
BUILD A FIRE."
 Jeff: BRAD, THIS IS NOT A
REVOLUTIONARY IDEA TO THINK IF
NORSIFORCING A TIE IF YOU THINK
TWO ARE TIGHT.
THIS IS BASIC "SURVIVOR"
STRATEGY.
WE CAN UP OUR ODDS BY FORCING A
TIE AND GOING TO FIRE.
 ABSOLUTELY, IF THEY BOTH FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE, THEY CAN
ABSOLUTELY DO THAT.
 Jeff: TAI, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THIS?
 THERE'S SOME DOUBT.
THERE'S GOT TO BE, THAT THEY'RE
VOTING FOR YOU, NOT FOR ME.
WHATEVER THEY'RE TELLING YOU,
WHO KNOWS IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT.
 Jeff: TROYZAN, IT'S ONE
SIMPLE VOTE TO GET TO THE END,
BUT THERE ARE ALL THESE
POSSIBILITIES.
 IT'S NEVER A SIMPLE VOTE,
JEFF.
SO I'M GOING TO PUT MY TRUST IN
MYSELF BECAUSE I'M TRUSTING MY
INTUITION, AND IF IT'S RIGHT,
I'LL WALK OUT OF HERE A FINAL
THREE GUY.
IF I'M NOT, I'M BUILDING A FIRE
TONIGHT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SARAH,
TAI, TROYZAN, ONE OF YOU IS
ABOUT TO BE THE TENTH AND FINAL
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
TROYZAN, YOU'RE UP.
 THIS IS THE HARDEST NAME THAT
I'VE HAD TO WRITE DOWN THIS
SEASON.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, TAI.
TROYZAN.
TAI.
THAT'S TWO VOTES TAI, ONE VOTE
TROYZAN, ONE VOTE LEFT.
17th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY,
TAI.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
 FRIENDS FOR LIFE, BUDDY.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: TAI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
 THANK YOU, JEFF FOR A GREAT
SEASON.
 Jeff: THANK YOU FOR COMING
BACK.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT IN
BEAUTIFUL FIJI.
WE'LL SEE YOU HERE TOMORROW
NIGHT FOR YOUR FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THE
FINAL THREE AND POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE WON.
I MEAN, I DID A LOT, IDOL, MADE
A COUPLE OF BIG MOVES, SOCIALLY,
PEOPLE LIKED ME.
I MEAN, THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH
GAME.
BUT I BOUNCED BACK, AND I'LL
JUST GROW STRONGER.
♪ ♪ ♪
 39, BABY.
39 DAYS.
WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK IT?
THIS WAS A DREAM THEY TRULY PUT
OUT THERE 16 YEARS AGO WHEN I
WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE.
I'M LIKE, "I WANT TO BE THE SOLE
SURVIVOR."
AND TO GET TO THE THREE ALMOST
FEELS LIKE I'M THERE.
 ARE YOU CRYING?
 YEAH.
IT'S JUST EMOTIONAL.
 OH!
 NO, IT'S THE SMOKE.
MY SOCIAL GAME WAS REAL.
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK TO
PEOPLE OPENLY, AND I WORKED THAT
ANGLE FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE
MIDDLE TO THE TOP THE WHOLE
GAME.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT HELPED ME
BECAUSE PEOPLE DID TRUST ME,
NEVER WROTE MY NAME DOWN, AND I
GOT TO DAY 39.
MAYBE THIS SEASON YOUR
PERSONALITY, YOUR LOYALTY, YOUR
GAME PLAY FROM THE INSIDE MAYBE
WILL COUNT MORE.
AND I GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT
THIS.
HOLY MACKEREL.
THREE BASKETS.
 OH, LOOK AT THE MUFFINS.
 LOOK AT THAT, GUYS.
WELL-DESERVED MEAL.
 WOOO!
 FINAL THREE.
 FINAL THREE.
 FINAL THREE.
 DAY 39.
 WAY TO GO.
 KNOWING THEY AM IN THE FINAL
THREE IS THE BEST FEELING IN THE
WORLD.
 THIS IS A GOOD MEAL RIGHT
HERE.
 IT'S WHAT YOU DREAM OF WHEN
JEFF SAYS THE WORD "GO" ON DAY
ONE.
 YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WANT TO
EAT PANCAKES.
I WORKED MY BUTT OFF TO GET
HERE.
I MADE MOVES THAT OTHER PEOPLE
WERE SCARED TO MAKE.
I MADE MOVES THAT I WAS SCARED
TO MAKE.
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF HOW I
PLAYED.
BRAD, ARE YOU EVEN NERVOUS ABOUT
TONIGHT?
 NOT REALLY.
 AS A POLICE OFFICER, I DON'T
RESPECT BEING LIED TO.
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU THINK
THAT I'M STUPID.
BUT I'M THE CRIMINAL TONIGHT.
AND THOSE PEOPLE ON THE JURY ARE
THE POLICE OFFICERS.
SO IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE
TRUTH, I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
THE TRUTH BECAUSE I REWARD
HONESTY.
I HOPE THEY REWARD MY HONESTY
TONIGHT.
 THE WHOLE DAY I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT, OKAY, WHAT HAVE
I DONE?
AND I FEEL THAT I'M IN A GOOD
POSITION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A
GAME CHANGER AND MANEUVERED MY
WAY TO WHERE I CONTROLLED MY
DESTINY THIS ENTIRE GAME.
I'VE WON FIVE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES.
I PUT MYSELF HERE.
I WASN'T DRUG HERE.
I DID IT ON MY OWN.
AND I BROUGHT THE PEOPLE I WANT
WITH ME HERE.
I DON'T NEED THE MONEY, BUT I
DESPERATELY WANT TO WIN.
WINNING THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR"
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.
AND I CAN ARGUE MY CASE AT THE
END OF THE DAY AND WALK OUT OF
TRIAL THINKING I'VE GOT IT.
SLAM DUNK.
BUT QUITE FRANKLY, I HAVE NOT
BEEN IN A TRIAL FOR A
MILLION-DOLLAR CASE CASE.
I'M KIND OF IN A TRIAL FOR A
MILLION-DOLLAR CASE TONIGHT.
I'M KIND OF IN A TRIAL FOR A
MILLION-DOLLAR CASE TONIGHT.
 Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
YOUR JURY.
HALI.
OZZY.
DEBBIE.
ZEKE.
SIERRA.
ANDREA.
MICHAELA.
CIRIE.
AUBRY.
AND TAI, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
SO WELCOME TO THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL OF "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS."
IT HAS BEEN A SEASON FULL OF
FIRSTS-- MOST IDOLS EVER PLAYED
AT ONE TRIBAL-- THREE.
MOST PEOPLE EVER SAFE AT ONE
TRIBAL-- FIVE.
FIRST PERSON IN CIRIE EVER VOTED
OUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
ONE ELSE TO VOTE FOR.
FIRST TIME THE STEAL A VOTE WAS
PLAYED EFFECTIVELY WHEN SARLA
USED IT TO KNOCK OUT MICHAELA.
CULPEPPER WITH FIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WINS JOINS A VERY ELITE
GROUP THAT INCLUDES OZZY.
WE ALSO HAVE A NEW LEADER IN
MOST DAYS PLAYED ON "SURVIVOR,"
OZZY AT 128 DAYS, FOLLOWED RIGHT
BEHIND WITH CIRIE, AT 121.
 NICE!
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 Jeff: SO GIVEN THAT THIS IS
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS," AND
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY
FIRSTS, IT SEEMS ONLY
APPROPRIATE THAT WE END WITH
ANOTHER FIRST.
WE'RE ANYTHING TO CHANGE TRIBAL
COUNCIL UP THIS YEAR.
IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW FOR A
MORE OPEN DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE
JURY AND THE FINAL THREE.
WE'RE GOING TO CENTER IT AROUND
THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE GAME--
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.
OUTWIT WOULD BE THE SOCIAL PART
OF THE GAME, THE EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, YOUR ALLIANCES,
RELATIONSHIPS YOU HAD OUTSIDE OF
THOSE ALLIANCES.
THE OUTPLAY PORTION WOULD BE HOW
YOU RESPOND TO THE CONDITIONS
PUT ON YOU BY THE GAME.
YOU HAVE TO BUILD SHELTER.
YOU HAVE TO COMPETE IN
CHALLENGES.
THERE ARE SWITCHES.
THERE WILL BE TWISTS.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE HAND
YOU'RE DEALT?
AND THE FINAL PHASE, OUTLAST.
MOST CRITICAL.
DID YOU PUT PEOPLE ON THE JURY
WHO RESPECT THE WE YOU OUTWITTED
AND OUTPLAYED MORE THAN THE
OTHER TWO?
AND IF NOT, TONIGHT IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO SWAY THEM.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT
TO TAKE IT IN.
WE'LL GET STARTED.
♪ ♪ ♪
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S
START WITH THE OUTWIT PORTION OF
THE GAME, THE SOCIAL PART OF
"SURVIVOR."
WHO WANTS TO ADDRESS SARAH,
BRAD, OR TROYZAN FIRST?
 I'LL DO IT.
 Jeff: OKAY.
 SARAH, ON DAY THREE OF THIS
GAME, I GAVE YOU MY JACKET.
AND THEN I WAS BLINDSIDED, AND
EVERY NIGHT, YOU WORE MY JACKET
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
AND ALL I COULD THINK WAS, "HOT
DAMN!
THAT IS BAD ASS."
YOU MADE SUCH AMAZING
RELATIONSHIPS.
SIERRA, WHOM YOU WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR VOTING OUT, GAVE
YOU THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE BECAUSE
SHE DIDN'T PROCESS THAT YOU WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THIS
GAME.
SO, SARAH, I AM YOUR CHAMPION
TONIGHT.
AND I WISH YOU THE BEST.
 THANK YOU.
 I AM GOING TO SAY, I'M IN
SUCH A DILEMMA HERE.
SO, YOU KNOW, SARAH, YOU HAD
SOME BRILLIANT GAME MOVES,
REALLY.
LIKE, YOU CONVINCED EVERYONE
HERE THAT THEY WERE YOUR BEST
FRIEND.
AND YOU BROUGHT PEOPLE'S
PERSONAL FEEL INTOTION IT AND
EMOTIONS.
AND I FEEL-- I FEEL KIND OF
GROSS.
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO HAVE THIS EFFECT ON PEOPLE?
YES, ON ONE SIDE, I CAN RESPECT,
HEY, SHE FOOLED US ALL.
BUT AM I GOING TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THAT VOTE?
 I WANT EVERYONE OVER THERE TO
KNOW, MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
WERE 100% REAL FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART.
( LAUGHING ).
 WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
HONEST.
 I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WHY
SHOULD WE TRUST WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING TO US RIGHT NOW?
LOOK, I PLAYED THIS GAME, AS WE
FOUND OUT, MORE THAN ANYBODY
ELSE.
THERE IS A WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITHOUT GOING AS LOW AS YOU HAD
TO GO.
 YEAH.
I LIED.
BUT IT'S WHAT I HAD TO DO SIT
HERE, AND I WAS FLOG DO WHATEVER
IT TOOK.
 THEN AGAIN, SOMEBODY LIKE
BRAD, WHO AS A COMPETITOR, I
GIVE YOU PROPS.
YOU GET PUT INTO A POSITION
WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO WIN, WIN,
WIN, WIN, WIN.
AND NOBODY-- VERY FEW PEOPLE,
YOU AND I AND A FEW OTHER
PEOPLE-- UNDERSTAND HOW HARD
THAT IS.
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GET HIS
HANDS DIRTY.
HE COULD DO IT IN A WAY THAT WAS
MORE CLEAN AND MORE LOYAL.
SO I WILL BE BRAD'S CHAMPION AT
THIS POINT.
 Jeff: CIRIE, SOCIAL PART OF
THE GAME, OUTWIT.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
 BRAD, MOST OF US SITTING HERE
VOTED SIERRA OUT BECAUSE WE KNEW
SHE WAS THE BRAINS OF YOUR
OPERATION AND THAT WITHOUT HER,
YOU AND TROYZAN PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE JUST BUMPED INTO EACH
OTHER.
EXPLAIN HOW SHE DIDN'T RUN THE
FIRST PORTION OF YOUR GAME.
 WHEN I LANDED ON THE BEACH, I
STARTED WORKING WITH PEOPLE,
WITH TAI, WITH SIERRA.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WITH J.T.
I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE
GAME-CHANGING, I THINK, MOVE OF
THE SEASON, WHEN WE ENDED UP
GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WITH TWO
GROUPS.
BUT I HAD BUILT SUCH A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH J.T., THAT HE
CAME TO ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
WHOLE TRIBAL COUNCIL AND TOLD ME
EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE VOTING
OUT, AND I SAVED SIERRA THAT
NIGHT.
AND I'M CALLING IT THE TURNING
POINT OF THE GAME BECAUSE I GOT
RID OF MALCOLM, AND WE ALL MIGHT
NOT BE HERE IF MALCOLM WERE
HERE.
 I'LL PUT IN AN OPINION.
FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, IT
DID LOOK LIKE SIERRA WAS THE
BRAINS OF THE OPERATION.
BUT CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A
SOCIAL GAME BUILT ON
RELATIONSHIPS, I'M INTERESTED TO
KNOW HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
ABOUT ME.
 WELL, YOU'RE FROM TEXAS.
YOU WENT TO TEXAS CHRISTIAN.
YOU HAVE-- YOU WORK WITH A SALES
COMPANY FOR VACATIONS.
I MEAN... WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW, YOU KNOW?
 WOW.
 NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
 THEN--
 I MEAN, BRAD, THAT'S MAYBE
WHERE YOU WERE LACKING.
I MEAN, SARA, EVEN THOUGH A LOT
OF US FEEL GROSS ABOUT TSHE
DEVELOPED PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS.
HOWEVER, SARA, I'M ACTUALLY JUST
CURIOUS HOW DID YOU IT.
HOW DID YOU MANAGE PEOPLE'S
PERSONAL FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS?
 SARAH, BEFORE YOU ANSWER
THAT, I'M SHOCKED TO LEARN
THAT-- THAT SARAH WAS DOING ALL
THESE THINGS ABUSE WHAT I HAD
WITH YOU WAS, I THOUGHT WAS
REAL.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW COMING FROM YOUR MOUTH.
WE ALL HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE
WITH YOU.
SO TELL ME--
 WELL, MY FIRST SEASON, I
PLAYED WHO I WAS IN REAL LIFE.
AND THAT GOT SARAH NOWHERE.
AND MY SUPPORT SYSTEMS AT HOME
BASICALLY GAVE ME THE PERMISSION
TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES AND DO
WHATEVER I NEEDED.
 BUT I THINK WHAT ANDREA IS
ASKING IS NOT FOR A GENERALITY.
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO
SAY, "THIS IS REAL SARAH.
THIS IS GAME SARAH?"
 HONESTLY, IT COMES FROM BEING
A POLICE OFFICER FOR THE LAST 10
YEARS, WORKING UNDER COVER.
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER COVER, YOU
HAVE TO SHUT OFF WHO ARE YOU AND
BE SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU'RE BUYING DRUGS, YOU'RE A
DRUG USER NOW.
IF YOU'RE A PROSTITUTE, YOU'RE A
PROSTITUTE.
I HAVE TO PLAY A ROLE OF SOMEONE
I AM NOT.
AND I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IT'S SCARY HOW IT SHUTS ON
AND OFF, BUT I HAVE TO DO THAT
FOR A LIVING.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, IF THE ENDS
DON'T JUSTIFY THE MEANS, THEN
WHAT DOES?
THINK MACHIAVELLI THE PRINCE,
LADY McBETH.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO WIN THIS
GAME AND YOU DO IT AT ALL COSTS.
I HAVE ZERO RESPECT FOR YOU AND
YOUR GAME PLAY, AND THAT'S WHY I
AM HIS LIEUTENANT IN ARMS FOR
YOU, BRAD, BECAUSE SHE NEVER
WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE
WITHOUT YOU.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, YOU HAVE A
LOOK ON YOUR FACE TO DEBBIE'S
COMMENT.
 I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE EMOTIONAL FEELING THAT
PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SARAH.
LIKE, EVEN WHEN SARAH USED THE
ADVANTAGE TO VOTE ME OUT, IT
WASN'T SOMETHING THEY TOOK
PERSONALLY.
I WAS JUST, LIKE, GOOD THING YOU
GOT RID OF ME, BECAUSE I'M THE
ONLY ONE THAT COULD BEAT BRAD.
HOWEVER, I DID WANT TO ASK A
QUESTION OF TROYZAN--
 WOW!
 WHAT CAN YOU TELL THE JURY
WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DID FROM A
SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE IN THIS GAME?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE TALKED
TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU, AND
I HAD PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
AND I WAS READY TO HAVE AN
ALLIANCE WITH ALL OF YOU, IF
THAT WAS TO MY BENEFIT.
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
MAY FULL OUT BECAUSE I FELT LIKE
I WAS PLAYING WITH, LIKE, TWO
LOVED ONES--
 HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
FROM MY STANDPOINT, THERE'S A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A
PASSENGER AND BEING A DRIVER.
 I'M SITTING HERE, THOUGH.
I'M SITTING HERE.
AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE.
 FOR SURE.
 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
 FOR SURE.
 I MADE MOVES NOOUFS BASICALLY
HELP MY GAME.
WHEN I GOT TO THE MERGE, I GOT
TOGETHER WITH SIX PEOPLE THEY
KNEW I COULD TRUST AT THAT
POINT.
AND IF THEY WANTED TO VOTE YOU
OUT, OF COURSE, I'M GOING TO DO
THAT.
 BUT I SAID "THEY" WANTED TO.
YOU DIDN'T SAY "I" WANTED TO.
THEN YOU WERE A PASSENGER LIKE
HE'S SAYING.
 YEAH, TROYZAN, IN TERMS OF
THE DECISION MAKING WHAT, ROLE
DID YOU PLAY IN IS THAT THA?
 WELL, IT WASN'T AS DIRECT TO
SAY, "THIS ISLET PERSON.
THAT'S THE PERSON."
I DID THINGS IN A SENSE MORE
SNEAKY AND MADE SUGGESTIONS --
 I'M HEARING IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF CAN "ANYONE BUT ME."
A LITTLE BIT SANDRA WITHOUT THE
FAT.
 IT'S A LITTLE BIT "ANYONE BUT
ME."
BUT I CAN MAKE MOVES FROM THE
FROM THE MIDDLE OR THE BOTTOM
JUST AS EASY.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SITTING
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
 UH-HUH.
 I WANT TO SAY PEOPLE WHO
DIDN'T GET IN AN ALLIANCE DIDN'T
GET TO SEE THE WAY HE PLAYED.
YOU WERE A PART OF VOTES.
YOU JUST DID IT IN A MORE SUBTLE
WAY.
 THANK YOU.
 OWN IT.
IT'S NOT DONE YET.
 THANK YOU.
 Jeff: ANDREA, WEIGH IN ON
CULPEPPER'S SOCIAL PART OF THE
GAME, THE OUTWIT PORTION.
 OKAY, BRAD, YOU PLAYED A
PRETTY SOLID GAME.
YOU WERE LOYAL.
YOU WON A BUNCH OF IMMUNITIES.
BUT YOU NEVER REACHED OUT AND
TRIED TO FORM RELATIONSHIPS WITH
PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM, PEOPLE
LIKE MICHAELA, AND YOU WERE VERY
NASTY TOWARDS PEOPLE LIKE TAI.
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR
THOUGHTS ON THAT.
 AS FAR AS MICHAELAA, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, MICHAELA AND I
WERE OIL AND WATER.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
YOU AND I JUST DIDN'T CONNECT.
AND YOU TALK ABOUT TAI,
BASICALLY, I MUST HAVE BEEN
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT SOCIALLY
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME HUTWO IDOLS.
SO I WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING
I COULD TO MAKE YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE TO MAKE YOU EITHER
GIVE ME AN IDOL SO I COULD
PROTECT YOU OR YOU PLAYED BOTH
YOUR IDOLS.
 I THINK-- DO YOU REALIZE HOW
YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?
DO YOU REALIZE THE WAY YOU
APPROACHED TALKING TO ME TIME
AFTER TIME AFTER TIME SAYING, "I
CONTROL YOU.
OR YOU GO HOME NEXT."
I SAID, "NO, WHY--"
 I UNDERSTAND.
 YOU REALIZE THAT'S HOW YOU
CAME ACROSS TO ME?
 YOU MADE A CHOICE TO GO WITH
THE GIRLS AND NOT STAY WITH THE
ALLIANCE I TRIED TO MAKE AND
THAT'S FINE.
AFTER THAT I GAINED POWER
WINNING IMMUNITIES AND I WAS
TRYING TO USE THIS POWER TO
MANIPULATE YOU AND YOUR IDOLS.
 SO, BRAD, DID YOU JUST SAY
YOU USED CONDESCENSION AS A
STRATEGY TO CONTROL TAI?
 I DIDN'T SAY I CONDESCEND.
I SAID, "THIS IS AN OPTION I'M
GIVING YOU"
I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO MAKE A
DEAL, BUT IT CAME WITH A PRICE.
AND THE PRICE WAS THE IDOL.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, TBHAEG ON
CULPEPPER'S SOCIAL PART OF THE
GAME.
 WELL, I'VE GOT THREE
BROTHERS.
I'M SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE IN THE
MILITARY.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR TESTOSTERONE
LEVEL IS 100 TIMES THE AVERAGE
MALE.
I DO GET THAT YOU ARE NOT THE
WARMEST, FUZZIEST, CUDDLIEST
TEDDY BEAR.
LOVE YOU, ANYWAY.
 BUT TO BE HONEST, LIKE, THIS
GAME, THIS SHIP, HAD ONE DRIVER.
AND THAT WAS SARAH.
SARAH ALWAYS VOTED THE RIGHT
WAY.
BECAUSE SARAH ALWAYS KNEW THE
RIGHT WAY TO VOTE.
BECAUSE SARAH WAS ALWAYS
DIRECTING THE RIGHT WAY TO VOTE.
 I JUST WANT TO THROW IT OUT
THERE.
I MEAN, THIS IS SO RICH AND SO
INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL.
AND MY MIND IS EVEN LESS MADE UP
NOW IN A GREAT WAY THAN WHEN I
STORMED INTO THIS TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO,
CLEARLY, THERE ARE VARYING
OPINIONS ABOUT EACH OF YOU, IN
TERMS OF THE SOCIAL PART OF
"SURVIVOR."
LET'S MOVE INTO THE OUTPLAY
PORTION OF THE SAME GAME.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SHELTER,
COMPETE IN CHALLENGES, SWITCHES
AND ADVANTAGES.
ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANT
TO SAY AT THE TOP?
 BRAD THE OUTPLAY PORTION GOES
TO YOU.
YOU NEVER STOPPED WORKING.
IF YOU HAVEN'T WON IMMUNITY THE
LAST FIVE TIMES, THE CHANCES OF
HIM SITTING THERE PROBABLY ZERO.
HE TOOK A RISK PLAYING IN A WAY
THEY RESPECT, AND A LOT OF YOU
GUYS WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THIS
MEANS BECAUSE YOU BRUTALIZE YOUR
BODY TO GET TO THIS POINT.
I FAILED EVERY SINGLE TIME I'VE
PLAYED.
I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT.
AND I THINK THAT THIS MAN, HE
DID IT.
AND I THINK HE DESERVES TO WIN
BECAUSE HE RELIED ON HIMSELF
WHEN HE NEEDED TO.
WE ARE THE AUTHORS OF OUR
DESTINY.
WE ARE THE AUTHORS OF OUR STORY
IN THIS GAME.
AND BRAD PLAYED HAV FROM THE VER
BEGINNING TO WIN THIS GAME, AND
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
 Jeff: DEBBIE, HOW MUCH
VALUE DO YOU GIVE TO CAMP LIFE
AND PROVIDING?
DOES IT WEIGH IN ON YOUR VOTE?
 TO ME, "SURVIVOR" HAS ALWAYS
BEEN "THE LORD OF THE FLIES."
AND I AGREE WITH OZZY
COMPLETELY.
I KNOW IT'S YOUR MAEK UP.
IT'S YOUR CHARACTER.
IT'S YOUR VERY NATURE TO SAY,
"THIS IS WHAT HAS TO BE DONE."
THEY WOULD NOT BE SITTING THERE
WITHOUT YOU, SIR.
 THANK YOU, THANK YOU, OZZY,
TOO.
THANK YOU BOTH.
 I MEAN, AS FAR AS THE
OUTPLAY, BRAD'S A PROFESSIONAL
ATHLETE, PEOPLE.
OOB.
 I'M 47.
I WAS.
 I'M JUST MAKING A POINT.
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
 BUT, THE PUZZLES ARE NOT
ATHLETIC--
 LET HER FINISH THE STATEMENT,
PLEASE.
 HERE'S THE THING.
I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE ANYTHING
AWAY FROM BRAD AT ALL.
WENING FIVE IMMIEWNTS IS TOUGH.
BUT WHAT I HAD TO RELY ON WAS MY
TOOLS THEY HAD IN THE OUTPLAY
DEPARTMENT.
SIERRA TELLS ME IN THE EVENT SHE
GETS VOTED OUT SHE WILL WILL HER
LEGACY ADVANTAGE TO ME.
SO NOW I NEED TO GET SIERRA OUT.
BUT HOW AM I GOING TO VOTE HER
OUT AND STILL GET HER TO WILL IT
TO ME?
AND I HAD TO ADAPT TO THE
SITUATION AND ACT LIKE THAT.
AND THE DAY THAT CIRIE GOT
ACROSS THAT BEAM WAS AN
EMOTIONAL DAY FOR EVERYONE.
THE GAME DIDN'T STOP, THOUGH.
AND GUESS WHAT?
MICHAELA'S SITTING ON THE
SIT-OUT BENCH NOT GETTING TO
PLAY.
AND AT THE BOTTOM OF HER FEET I
SEEING IN SMG.
IT SAYS, "SECRET ADVANTAGE" ON
IT.
ANYONE THAT WAS THERE THAT DAY
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT.
IT WASN'T HIDDEN.
PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS
HOW MY PLAYING THE GAME GOT ME
RIGHT HERE.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, YOU WERE
INVOLVED IN A TWIST WHEN THE
ADVANTAGE WAS AT YOUR FEET THAT
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALLY KNOW
ABOUT.
 YEAH, LIKE, IT WAS A GREAT
MOVE.
AND THE THING THAT MAKES SARAH
SO BAD-ASS, IS THAT SHE GOT THE
ADVANTAGE FROM THE SIT-OUT BENCH
THAT I WAS ON.
IF YOU ARE WORKING PEOPLE SO
WELL THAT YOU CAN BE SO BOLD AS
TO SAY, "THAT WAS AN ADVANTAGE
THAT WAS MEANT FOR YOU, AND I
TOOK IT," THAT'S SOME BAD-AS, IS
STUFF.
AND THEN TO TOP IT OFF, YOU USED
IT AGAINST ME AND SENT ME HOME.
THAT WAS BRILLIANT!
 Jeff: CIRIE, IT'S VERY
INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE SO MANY
DIFFERENT OPINIONS.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT ALL THE
ELEMENTS THAT COME IN TO
DECIDING WHO WINS?
IT MATTERS, JEFF, BECAUSE WE
HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE
ASPECT, AND IF YOU FELL SHORT
ANYWHERE, WE HAVE TO BRING IT UP
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO AWARD
SOMEBODY A MILLION DOLLARS
THAT'S NOT ONE OF US.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE
GIVING IT TO THE RIGHT PERSON.
 Jeff: SO, THE GAME IS
CLEARLY STILL ALIVE.
NOW WE'RE AT THE OUTLAST PORTION
OF THE GAME.
DID YOU PUT THE PEOPLE ON THE
JURY THAT RESPECT YOUR OUTWIT,
AND YOUR OUTPLAY MORE THAN THE
OTHER TWO?
CULPEPPER, WE'LL START WITH YOU.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO MOVE
ANYBODY THAT YOU THINK MIGHT NOT
BE ON YOUR SIDE.
 I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO
DECEIVE AND LIE TO EVERY SINGLE
PERSON TO WIN THIS GAME.
I CAME INTO THE GAME, LET PEOPLE
COME TO ME.
I BUILT RELATIONSHIPS THAT
CHANGED THE GAME AT CERTAIN
POANTS.
GOT FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN.
SO AT THAT POINT, I HAD TO RELY
ON MY ATHLETICISM OR BRAIN.
AND I DID JUST THAT.
SO I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE END,
AND I WON THE FIVE IMMUNITYS.
AND THEN AS FAR AS THE LIVING
AND THE CAMP LIFE, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I DID ALL THAT TO GET YOUR
VOTES.
I DID ALL THAT BECAUSE THAT'S
WHO I AM.
BUT ANYWAY, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR
AND A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY WITH ALL
YOU GUYS.
 Jeff: SARAH, LAST CHANCE TO
SWAY THE JURY.
 OKAY.
HERE'S THE THING.
YOU HAVE TO STRIKE FIRST IN THIS
GAME.
THE REASON YOU GUYS ARE THERE
AND THESE TWO AREN'T IS BECAUSE
I TRULY BELIEVE YOU GUYS COULD
HAVE BEAT ME.
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU GUYS CAN
RESPECT THE GAME PLAY AND HOW
HARD IT WAS TO PLAY WITH 20
PEOPLE AT SUCH A HIGH-CALIBER A
PLAYER, AND BE ONE STEP AHEAD
EVERY TIME.
BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE PERSON
HERE THAT WAS IN ON EVERY VOTE.
I THINK THE HISTORY SHOWS THAT
THE TRAINING AND THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT TO THE SITUATIONS THAT
YOU'RE PLACED IN IS WHAT SAVES
MY LIFE WHEN I'M AT WORK.
AND THAT SAME TRAINING I APPLIED
OUT HERE TO SAVE MY LIFE IN THIS
GAME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TROYZAN.
 I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP IT
LIGHT, YOU GUYS, AND I HAVE A
PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHERE YOU STAND
WITH ME.
SO I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE
BEST STRATEGIST.
I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST
GAME PLAYER.
BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU FOR THIS
ADVENTURE.
YOU'RE A PART OF MY DREAM.
I'VE WATCHED FROM SEASON ONE,
YOU KNOW, WHEN RICHARD HATCH WAS
RUNNING AROUND NAKED AND PEOPLE
WERE EEGHT RATS.
AND I'M LIKE WHATEVER THAT IS.
I HAVE TO BE A PART OF IT.
I APPRECIATE IT FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART.
REALLY, IT MEANS A LOT, YOU
GUYS.
AND I'M OUT.
( APPLAUSE )
 GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, A GREAT
FINAL TRIBAL.
VERY HEALTHY DISCUSSION.
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE JURY A
MOMENT TO TAKE IN EVERYTHING
YOU'VE HEARD TONIGHT, AND THEN
YOU WILL MAKE A MILLION-DOLLAR
DECISION.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY,
TONIGHT, YOU ARE VOTING FOR A
WINNER.
THE PERSON YOU THINK MOST
DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF "SOLE
SURVIVOR" AND THE MILLION
DOLLARS THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.
SIERRA, YOU'RE UP.
 YOU PLAYED A FLAWLESS GAME,
GIRL.
ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T VOTE FOR YOU
IS A BITTER BETTY.
 I HOPE THAT YOU CAN DO WHAT
I'VE TRIED TO DO FOUR TIMES.
I THINK YOU DESERVE IT.
 I AM SO HONORED TO BE VOTING
FOR YOU, ONE OF THE GREAT
MASTERS AND GREAT PLAYERS OF
THIS GAME.
CONGRATULATIONS, OFFICER SARAH.
 BECAUSE IN THIS JADED, CRAZY
WORLD, GOOD GUYS FINISH FIRST.
 BECAUSE IN THIS JADED, CRAZY
WORLD, GOOD GUYS FINISH FIRST.
 Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE
VOTES.
 Jeff: CULPEPPER, SARA,
TROYZAN, JURY, THANK YOU FOR A
GREAT FINAL TRIBAL.
I WILL SEE EVERYBODY BACK IN THE
STATES FOR THE READING OF THE
VOTES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 COCHRAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 COCHRAN!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT!
THANK YOU!
AWESOME!
HAVE A SEAT!
LET'S NOT WASTE ANY TIME.
THANK YOU FOR THAT NICE WELCOME.
SO HERE'S ITS DEAL.
WHEN WE HAD THIS IDEA TO DO
"GAME CHANGERS" WE TALKED ABOUT,
WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHO WE WANTED
TO COME BACK.
WE SAID WE HAVE, TRULY, ONE
HOPE.
PLEASE LET THERE BE SOME BIG
MOVES.
THAT WAS A GENUINE HOPE.
YOU GUYS DELIVERED SO MANY BIG
MOVES, YOU MADE HISTORY.
THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER AMAZING
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT NOW, IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.
AFTER 39 DAYS OF DECISIONS,
BRAD, TROYZAN, SARAH, DID YOU
MAKE THE RIGHT ONE?
THE JURY, DID YOU PUT PEOPLE ON
THE JURY WHO THINK YOU DESERVE
IT MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO?
I'M GOING TO READ THE VOTES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HERE WE GO!
FIRST VOTE, SARAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CULPEPPER.
( APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: ONE VOTE SARA, ONE
VOTE CULPEPPER.
SARAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TWO VOTES SARA, ONE VOTE
CULPEPPER.
CULPEPPER.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES SARAH, TWO
VOTES CULPEPPER.

VOTES SARAH.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S FOUR VOTES SARAH, THREE
VOTES CULPEPPER.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

CULPEPPER.
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS," SARAH.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 GOOD JOB.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 GOOD JOB.
 GOOD JOB, BABY.
 Jeff: IT WAS AN EPIC WIN.
YOU COULD HEAR THE ENERGY HERE.
SARAH, HERE'S YOUR CHECK.
SHE'S CELEBRATING.
YOU'LL TAKE IT.
ALL RIGHT.
WE CALLED THEM "GAME CHANGERS"
AND THEY LIVED UP TO IT.
HISTORIC GAME PLAY, PLUS A
MOMENT THAT HAD THE ENTIRE WORLD
TALKING WHEN ZEKE WAS OUTED AS
TRANSJERPD.
LIVE REUNION SHOW COMING UP
NEXT.
( APPLAUSE )
