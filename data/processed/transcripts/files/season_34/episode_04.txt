         Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": ANDREA, FOR THE WIN
( CHEERS )
TAVUA WON THEIR SECOND IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE AND THERE WAS A TWIST
FOR THE TWO LOSING TRIBES.
ONE GROUP WHERE YOU WILL VOTE
OUT ONE PERSON.
 OH!
 Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT
WAS UTTER CHAOS.
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
HERE, JEFF?
 Jeff: OH, MY GOSH!
J.T. LEAKED NUKU'S PLAN.
AND TAI USED IT TO HIS
ADVANTAGE.
 I THINK I'M GOING TO GIFT
IDOL TO PRETTY LADY.








 Jeff: SAVING THE MANA
TRIBE.
SIERRA, DOES NOT COUNT.
AND SENDING MALCOLM HOME.
16 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
 HOW IS IT TAI GIVES SIERRA
THE IDOL OUT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE
THERE.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 WHY MALCOLM?
 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
 WHEN I SAID PHYSICAL THREATS,
I STARTED GETTING NERVOUS.
 CULPEPPER SAID YOU WERE GOOD.
 WHAT ELSE DID YOU TELL
CULPEPPER?
 I DIDN'T TELL CULPEPPER ABOUT
WHO WE WERE VOTING FOR.








TRIBAL COUNCIL WENT TONIGHT
ABOUT AS BAD AS IT COULD.
I TOLD BRAD SIERRA WAS IN
TROUBLE AND TO PLAY THE IDOL IF
HE HAD IT.
>I THOUGHT IT WAS AN
EASY OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF
SANDRA.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY VOTED OUT
OUR STRONGEST PLAYER, MALCOLM.
MALCOLM WAS MY CLOSEST FRIEND ON
THE TRIBE AND I HAVE TO SMOOTH
IT OVER AS BEST I CAN AND MOVE
FORWARD.
 SOMEHOW, THAT NAME SLIPPED
BECAUSE HOW WOULD TAI, OF ALL
PEOPLE, GIVE IT TO HER.
 AND CULPEPPER, WHEN I GOT
SCARED, WHEN I THOUGHT CULPEPPER
HAD AN IDOL.
THEY CAN'T REALLY PROVE WHAT I
SAID, SO I'M GOING TO DEFEND
MYSELF 100%.
TAKE IT TO MY GRAVE.
BECAUSE I'M HERE TO WIN $1
MILLION.
 AND TAI TURNED AROUND, AND
CULPEPPER SAYS SIERRA, AND
SIERRA WENT LIKE THIS TO HIM AND
TOOK IT.
 I TOLD HIM HE WAS SAVE.
 J.T.'S HANDS ARE ALL OVER
THIS.
THIS IS J.T.' J.T.'S DIRTY DEED,
IF HE KNOWS HOW I AM, I'M GOING
TO TURN AROUND AND SEND HIS ASS
PACKING RIGHT BEHIND MALCOLM IF
I CAN.
HE CROSSED ME.
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.
 TRIERK WAS REALLY TOUGH ONE.
MY BIGGEST FEAR RIGHT NOW IS,
YOU KNOW, IF WE LOSE AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, I SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO GO.
SO I'VE GOT TO GET MY HANDS ON
AN IDOL.
YOU KNOW, AS MUCHAISE HATE IT,
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU KNOW, AS MUCHAISE HATE IT,
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

LO AND BEHOLD I FOUND A CLUE.
AND IT SAYS, "TO FIND YOUR
SAFETY REQUIRES INTERSECTING
LANDMARKS AROUND YOUR BEACH.
SEARCH CASUALLY OR IN
DESPERATION, YOUR PROTECTION IS
IN REACH."
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
I'VE SEEN THE TREES WITH MARKS
ON THEM.
SO WITH EVERYONE AWAY FROM CAMP,
A COUPLE OF MINUTES, I'LL HAVE
IT.
COVER THIS UP.
LO AND BEHOLD, I FOUND THE IDOL
AND NO ONE KNOWS.
IT'S PERFECT.
I'LL NEVER TELL A SOUL, AND THAT
IDOL WILL KEEP ME IN THIS GAME.
BEAUTIFUL!
YES!
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
TAVUA GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW MANA TRIBE.
 ALL HERE.
 Jeff: STILL FULLY INTACT.
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
 Jeff: TAVUA GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW NUKU
TRIBE.
MALCOLM VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 WOW.
 OH, MY GOSH!
 Jeff: OZZY, WHY IS MALCOLM
SIGNIFICANT?
 MALCOLM IS A HUGE, HUGE
PLAYER IN THIS GAME.
AND FOR HIM TO BE GONE AT THIS
POINT, IT DEFINITELY CHANGES THE
GAME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
READY TO GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE?
 YES!
 Jeff: EACH TRIBE WILL USE A
GRAPPLING HOOK TO RETRIEVE A
BOW.
YOU'LL THEN DIG UP A BAG
CONTAINING A BALL.
YOU'LL BALANCE THE BALL ON THE
BOW THROUGH A SERIES OF
OBSTACLES.
YOU PLACE THE BALL AT THE
FINISH, THEN IT'S BACK TO THE
START, WHERE THE GRAPPLER WILL
HOOK A BAG CONTAINING A HANDLE.
YOU'LL DIG UP ANOTHER BALL.
YOU'LL BALANCE THE BALL ON THE
HANDLE THROUGH THE SAME
OBSTACLES.
ONCE BOTH BALLS ARE AT THE END,
ONE PERSON WILL RACE TO COMPLETE
A SLIDE PUZZLE.
FIRST TWO TROOB TRIBES TO FINISH
REWARD.
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?
 YES!
 OH!
 PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY!
 Jeff: PEANUT BUTTER AND
JELLY SANDWICHES, PLUS COOKIES
AND MILK.
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: SECOND TRIBE TO
FINISH--
 MY MOUTH IS WATERING.
 Jeff: YOU'RE NOT LEFT OUT.
JUST A TASTE.
P.B.&J.
 OH, MY GOD!
 Jeff: LAST TRIBE TO FINISH,
NOTHING.
TAVUA, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER, SITTING SOMEBODY OUT.
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?
TROYZAN.
 Jeff: TROYZAN, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE BENCH.
EVERYBODY ELSE, GIVE YOU A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.
 I WILL BE QUICK ON THE SLIDE
PUZZLE.
I DO IT ON MY PHONE ALL THE
TIME.
 YOU PICK AND PUT ME
SOMEWHERE.
 YOU PICK IT?
WHAT ARE YOU BEST AT?
 DIG THE BAGS.
 OKAY.
 I HAVE A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF
BALANCE.
 OKAY, THEN YOU BALANCE.
YOU'RE PLATE, YOU'RE BOW, YOU'RE
DIGGING.
 OKAY, GOT IT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE
GO.
FOR REWARD OF PEANUT BUTTER AND
JELLY, COOKIES AND MILK,
SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
IT'S GOING TO BE SARA, GARNER
AND CIERA AS THE GLAP GRAP LERS.
YOUR FIRST JOB IS HOOK THAT BOW.
SARAH A LITTLE SHORT.
SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
THAT ROPE.
CIERA'S GOT THE BOW ON HER
SECOND TOSS.
NICE JOB!
TAI OUT TO DIG UP THAT FIRST
BALL.
SARAH HAS HER BOW HOOKED.
IT IS CIRIE NOW DIGGING UP THE
BALL FOR TAVUA.
TAI HAS THE BALL FOR MANA.
IT IS GOING TO BE HALI NOW
TRYING TO BALANCE THAT.
HERE GOES HALI IN THE LEAD.
HALI HEADING OVER THE FIRST
OBSTACLE.
SHE DROPS, GOTTA GO BACK.
VARNER STILL TRYING TO HOOK THAT
BOW.
VARNER HOOKS FOR NUKU.
IT'S GOING TO BE MICHAELA
DIGGING UP FOR THAT BALL.
WOW!
MICHAELA WHIPPING THROUGH THE
SAND!
MICHAELA RECORD TIME WITH THE
BALL FOR NUKU.
 KEEP DIGGING, CIRIE.
 Jeff: FINALLY HAS THE BALL
FOR TAVUA.
J.T. GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
THERE GOES HALI, MAKING HER WAY
OVER THAT FIRST OBSTACLE.
OZZY DOES NOT HESITATE, LIKE HE
GREW UP DOING THIS IN THE
JUNGLE.
OPENING UP A LEAD FOR TAVUA.
 TAKE YOUR TIME, OZ.
JUST TAKE THE LEAD, BUDDY.
 Jeff: OZZY IS THROUGH THE
FIRST OBSTACLE VERY EASY.
 NICE.
 Jeff: OZZY NOW ON THAT
SECOND OBSTACLE.
OZZY'S GOOD!
 YES, OZZY.
 Jeff: GET THAT BALL TO THE
FINISH.
GRAB THE NEXT BAG.
TAVUA OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD.
A NICE TOSS BY SARAH.
SARAH QUICKLY SNAGS THAT BAG FOR
TAVUA.
CIRIE DIGGING UP THE SECOND
BALL.
HALLEY'S GOOD!
 GOOD JOB, HALI!
 Jeff: MOVING ON TO THE
SECOND SECTION.
J.T. IS GOOD THROUGH THE FIRST
PART OF THIS.
IT IS HALI AND J.T. NOW.
J.T. DROPS, GOTTA TRY IT AGAIN.
HALI NOW GETTING IT.
SHE IS LOCKED IN THIS TIME.
AND IT WORKED.
HALI IS THROUGH.
DROP THE BALL!
GO, MANA!
CIERA NOW TRYING TO SNAG THAT
HANDLE.
 YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: CIRIE STILL DIGGING
FOR THAT BALL.
CIERA HAS IT.
TAI LOOKING FOR THAT SECOND
BALL.
IT IS NOW TAI AND CIRIE DIGGING
FOR THE SECOND BALL.
 GOT IT!
 Jeff: TAI QUICKLY FINDS THE
BALL FOR MANA, AND JUST LIKE
THAT, MANA IS NOW IN THE LEAD.
CIRIE FINALLY HAS THE BALL FOR
TAVUA.
IT IS NOW DEBBIE ON THE COURSE
FOR MANA WITH THE HANDLE.
ANDREA NOW ON THE COURSE FOR
TAVUA.
 SLOW DOWN.
THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: ANDREA IS THROUGH THE
FIRST STAGE VERY QUICKLY.
DEBHAD THE LEAD FOR MANA, BUT
SHE HAS LOST IT.
J.T. WITH A BIG FALL.
DEBBIE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE.
 GO, J.T., GO, BABY, GO.
COME ON, J.T.!
 GOOD JOB, J.T.
 Jeff: ANDREA, YOU'RE
THROUGH.
J.T., YOU'RE THROUGH!
GO, NUKU, GO, TAVUA!
TAVUA NOW CAN START WORKING ON
THE SLIDE PUZZLE, AND VARNER NOW
CAN TRY TO HOOK THAT BAG.
VARNER HOOKS THE BAG FOR NUKU.
IT IS NOW MICHAELA DIGGING
AGAIN.
CAN SHE GET IT AS QUICKLY AS SHE
DID LAST TIME.
 YES, I CAN, JEFF.
 Jeff: YES, SHE CAN.
THIS REALLY OPENS UP THE DOOR
FOR TAVUA AGAIN AND GIVES ZEKE A
LOT OF TIME TO START ON THAT
PUZZLE.
HE PUT HIMSELF IN THE HERO SPOT.
CAN HE DELIVER?
DEBBIE, FINALLY THROUGH THE
FIRST OBSTACLE.
AUBRY IS GOING TO FEEL THE
PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.
DEBBIE DROPS, SHE HAS TO GO
BACK.
YOU'RE GOOD, AUBRY.
AUBRY IS THROUGH THE FIRST
SECTION.
IT IS NOW DEBBIE AND AUBRY.
THEY PLAYED TOGETHER FOR FIRST
SEASON.
THEY ARE NOW AGAINST EACH OTHER.
CAN THEY CATCH ZEKE?
 GO, AUBRY, GO!
 GO, DEBGLE NO, DEBBIE'S GOT
TO GO BACK.
 YES!
 Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD!
AUBRY'S GOOD!
GO!
NUKU CAN START WORKING ON THEIR
SLIDE PUZZLE.
IT'S GOING TO BE SANDRA ON THE
PUZZLE TALKING ON ZEKE.
MANA WAS IN THE LEAD, BUT THEY
ARE DEAD LAST NOW AS DEBBIE
DROPS AGAIN.
SHE HAS LOST A LOT OF TIME.
 STAY CALM.
STAY CALM.
 Jeff: TAVUA GETTING CLOSER
TO THAT VICTORY.
 YES!
 Jeff: ZEKE THINKS HE HAS
IT.
ZEKE WINS REWARD FOR TAVUA!
WE ARE NOW LOOK FOR SECOND
PLACE.
IT IS NOW SANDRA WORKING ON THE
SLIDE PUZZLE FOR NUKU AS DEBBIE
CONTINUES TO TRY TO GET THROUGH
THIS OBSTACLE FOR MANA.
DEBBIE FAILS AGAIN.
> I KNOW.
 IT'S TOO SLIPPERY.
 GOT IT!
 Jeff: SANDRA THINKS SHE HAS
IT, AND SHE'S RIGHT!
NUKU WINS REWARD.
 GOOD JOB, BABY.
 Jeff: MANA COMES OUT
EMPTY-HANDED.
 I'M SICK OF LOSING, GUYS.
 ME, TOO.
 Jeff: TAVUA,
CONGRATULATIONS.
COME GRAB YOUR REWARD, PB & J,
COOKIES AND MILK.
NUKU, COME GRAB YOUR REWARD.
 I HOPE THEY'RE EVEN NUMBERED
BECAUSE WE FIGHT OVER ODDS.
 Jeff: MANA, GOT NOTHING FOR
YOU.
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.
 ONCE AGAIN, WE LOST.
IF WE DON'T STRATEGIZE, IT'S A
DICTATORSHIP WITH BRAD JUST
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT POSITIONS
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE.
 ANOTHER THEN YOU BALANCE.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS, I'M
PISSED.
 GOOD JOB, TEAM.
 CHEERS TO TAVUA!
 WOOO!
 GOOD JOB, GUYS.
GOOD BALANCING.
 TAVUA, WHO STARTED LITERALLY
FROM SCRATCH, HAS SOMEHOW BANDED
TOGETHER, AND WE'RE JUST, LIKE,
DOMINATING STUFF NOW.
 PEANUT BUTTER AND
"SURVIVOR--" THAT'S LIKE GOLD.
 BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
OVERCONFIDENT.
IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING
CRAZY HAPPENS, I NEED OPTIONS.
 I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS-- I FEEL LIKE I'M--
 HAS ANYONE TALKED TO YOU?
 NO.
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I
TRUST ON THIS TRIBE.
 OKAY.
 AT THIS POINT, TROYZAN AND I
ARE OUT AGAINST ME AND THE OTHER
FOUR.
THE SET FOUR, THAT'S STUPID.
THAT'S BORING.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
LET'S GROW UP.
COME ON.
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT US
TALKING, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.
I'M A DEAD WOMAN.
I'M COMPLETELY PLAYING THIS GAME
LIKE A CRIMINAL TH TIME.
I KNOW HOW CRIMINALS LIE TO ME.
SO I KNOW HOW TO LIE TO THESE
PEOPLE.
I'M LOOKING FOR AN IDOL, BUT YOU
BETTER NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON
ME.
 WHY WOULD I?
 OKAY, I'M JUST TELLING YOU.
 I HAVE AN IDOL, AND SARAH
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
AND SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO WORK
WITH ME.
SO IT WOULD BE A HUGE PLUS IN MY
GAME NOT TO PLAY MY IDOL RIGHT
NOW, SO IF I COULD WORK WITH
SARAH AND KEEP MY IDOL.
 GOOD ON THAT?
 YES, 100%.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE... THE
GOLDEN TICKET.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE... THE
GOLDEN TICKET.
 DEBBIE, TALK WITH US.
 DEBBIE!
 COME HERE.
 WHY DON'T THE FOUR OF YOU
TALK, MAKE DECISIONS, AND TELL
ME, AND WHEN YOU VOTE ME OUT,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HALI--
 DEBBIE, COME HERE.
 IS SHE ACTING?
 NO, I THINK SHE'S MAD.
I DON'T KNOW.
 TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, HALI
ROCKED THE BALANCE BEAM.
BUT DEBBIE COULDN'T GET OVER IT,
AND WE LOST THE PEANUT BUTTER.
AND SHE WAS ADAMANT THAT
SHEEBLGD BALANCE, BUT NOW SHE'S
REAL ANGRY, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE WANTS.
THE ONLY PREDICTABILITY OF
DEBBIE IS THAT SHE'S
UNPREDICTABLE.
 YOU OKAY?
 YEAH, I'M FINE.
 WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
 DON'T BE.
WE'RE FINE.
I'M (BLEEP).
I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS TOTEM
POLE.
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY, AS FAR
AS HE'S CONCERNED.
SO WHY DON'T I JUST SHUT THE
(BLEEP) UP AND LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M TOLD.
SO I WILL.
BRAD TREATS ME WITH VERY LITTLE
RESPECT.
BRAD IS USED TO BEING IN CHARGE,
WHETHER IT'S A FOOTBALL TEAM, A
LAW FIRM, HIS FAMILY-- BRAD IS
IN CHARGE.
HERE'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO--
IT'S A TOTAL LACK OF RESPECT FOR
ME.
WHATEVER YOU WANT, YOU GET.
HE'S GOT HIS HEAD SO FAR UP YOUR
ASS, HIS EYEBALLS ARE STICKING
OUT YOUR MOUTH.
 BRAD?
 YEAH.
IF HALI WANTS TO DO THE BALANCE
BEAM, EVEN THOUGH SHE COST UP
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY BY
DICKING AROUND FOR 10 FREAKING
MINUTES AND I ZIPPED ACROSS THE
BALANCE BEAM IN 30 SECONDS, THAT
MEANS YOU DON'T RESPECT ME.
IT'S NAUSEATING, FRUSTRATING,
AND I'M PISSED!
WHATEVER YOU WANT, YOU GET.
IF I SAY SOMETHING, IT'S TOTALLY
IGNORED.
 SO DEBBIE'S EXPLOSION ABOUT
BRAD CENTERED ON HER NOT BEING
HEARD IN THE CHALLENGES.
I DON'T REALLY SEE THE ARGUMENT.
I THINK BRAD IS GREAT IN
CHALLENGES.
HE'S A LEADER.
HE PULLS PEOPLE TOGETHER.
BUT SHE THINKS THAT I'M THE
PRINCESS.
I GET WHATEVER I WANT.
AND SHE'S THE GHOUL THAT GETS
NOTHING.
 WE'RE COOL.
IT'S HIM.
I'M SO (BLEEP) SICK OF HIM.
 BRAD?
 YEAH.
 I KNOW HE DOESN'T SHOW MUCH
RESPECT FOR YOU.
 NONE!
NONE!
NONE!
NOT A LITTLE, NONE!
 I'M TRYING TO COMFORT HER,
BUT WATCHING DEBBIE GET UPSET
LIKE THAT, I GOT REALLY SCARED.
I THINK DEBSEJUST DIFFERENT.
SHE'S LIKE A CRAZY LADY.
 THE PRINCESS HALI, WHATEVER
SHE WANTS SHE GETS.
 DEBTHINKS SHE'S AN EXPERT IN
EVERYTHING, BUT HALI IS BETTER
THAN HER, AS FAR AS AGILITY AND
THE CHALLENGE.
 WHEN YOU'RE TOTALLY NOT
RESPECTED FOR WHAT YOU SAY, WHY
DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE (BLEEP)
UP AND NOT TALK.
I GET IT.
IT'S COOL.
I'M GOOD.
I DON'T EXPLODE IN ANGER.
I TAKE IT OUT IN MY WORKOUT.
IT'S WHY I LOOK LIKE THIS, AND
HAVE AN EIGHT-PACK, BECAUSE I
DON'T GET PISSED.
THIS IS IT.
I'M VENTING.
IT WILL BE OVER.
I'LL MAKE A STRATEGIC, CALM,
DECISION.
AND IT MAY BE HIM.
I'D RATHER DIE FIGHTING THAN
LIVE ON MY KNEES.
SO IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR ME
TO MAKE MR. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH BRAD, MY NEXT TARGET.
 DEBBIE, I APOLOGIZE.
 I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DOING IT.
I DON'T.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE SO USED TO
BEING IN CHARGE OF THINGS, THAT
YOU DON'T REALIZE IT'S NOT A
CONVERSATION, AT LEAST WHEN IT
COMES TO ME, IT'S A
DICTATORSHIP.
AND THE FUNNIEST THING TO ME, I
HAD YOUR BARK MAN.
I WAS LOYAL TO YOU COMPLETELY,
LIKE, UTTERLY.
AND YOU CRUSHED MY HEART!
WHY NOT TAKE OUT BRAD NEXT?
HE'S A WANKER.
MAY THE BEST MAN BE LEFT
STANDING.
TBRING ON, BRAD, BRING IT ON.
♪ ♪ ♪
 THEY'RE MAKING COFFEE.
 IS THERE ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET
LEFTOVERS, PUT SEVEN DROPS OF
COFFEE AND A SCOOP OF SUGAR.
SEVEN DROPS OF COFFEE AND A
SCOOP OF SUGAR?
SURE.
 SEVEN DRIPS?
 IGNORANT, THAT'S IGNORANT,
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.
SCOOP, MY ASS.
IGNORANCE.
MICHAELA IS STARTING TO KIND OF
LOSE HER BEARINGS OUT HERE.
SHE'S A LITTLE OUT THERE
ALREADY, UNSTABLE.
YESTERDAY THE CHALLENGE WAS A
LITTLE BIT HARD FOR ME TO
HANDLE.
NO ONE WANTS TO BABY SIT OUT
HERE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO
SURVIVE.
AND TODAY SHE WANTS SEVEN DRIPS
OF COFFEE AND A SPOON FULL OF
SUGAR.
THAT BLOWS MY MIND.
 WHOA!
I LIKE IT!
 SO J.T. WAS ANNOYED THAT
MICHAELA WAS USING ONE
TABLESPOON OF SUGAR FOR A TINY
SIP OF COFFEE.
SO I HAD A SWEET IDEA.
AND I SAID, "I'M JUST GOING TO
GO AHEAD AND EAT THE REST OF THE
SUGAR."
AND THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT OF THE
SUGAR.
I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS SUGAR
OFF AND ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE
BECAUSE HE'LL THINK IT WAS
MICHAELA.
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON HERE THAT
USE THE SUGAR WAS J.T. AND
MICHAELA.
SO I KNEW J.T. WOULD BLAME
MICHAELA FOR THE SUGAR JAR BEING
EMPTY.
 SUGAR'S GONE.
I KNOW WHO HAS BEEN EATING IT,
WHO HAS BEEN EATING IT SPOON
FULLS TIE TIME.
MICHAELA.
 WHERE DID IT GO?
 IN HER MOUTH.
LICKED CLEAN.
 I BELIEVE YOU.
THE SUGAR DISAPPEARED.
 I WONDER HOW IT DISAPPEARED
SO FAST.
 J.T. THINKS IT'S MICHAELA,
AND IT'S 100% SANDRA.
 I DON'T EAT SUGAR SO--
 I DON'T EITHER.
SOMEBODY DOES.
 I WONDER WHO BEEN DRINKING
ALL THE COFFEE WITH SUGAR IN IT.
 I'VE BEEN DRINKING A LOT OF
COFFEE.
 IT MUST BE Y'ALL TWO.
BECAUSE SANDRA DON'T DRINK IT.
 IT'S NO SECRET, HONE BUN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
 J.T. WAS TRYING ACT LIKE I
TOOK THE SUGAR.
I WAS JUST SO ANGRY.
AND THE PROBLEM WITH ME IS THE
MORE I TRY TO HOLD SOMETHING IN,
THE WORSE IT GETS.
AND IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, IT'S
LIKE HOLD IT IN.
THOALD IN.
HOLD IT IN.
BUT I WANTED TO KILL HIM.
I HAVE TO, LIKE, LOOK AT, YOU
KNOW, WHAT-- YEAH, WHAT'S BEST
FOR ME.
AND I USED THE IDOL AT TRIBAL.
SO I'M THINKING THERE'S AN IDOL
OUT THERE.
I WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND GO
LOOK FOR AN IDOL.
AT LEAST I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
CHARGE OF MY GAME.
AT LEAST I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
CHARGE OF MY GAME.
( LAUGHS )
OH, MY GOD.
I FOUND ANOTHER CLUE.
I FOUND ANOTHER CLUE.
 Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?
 YES!
 Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ANDREA.
GOTTA TAKE IT BACK.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE UP AND OVER A TALL
WALL.
YOU'LL THEN WORK TOGETHER TO
ROLL A MASSIVE WOODEN CUBE TO A
POST.
YOU'LL THEN UNWIND A RING OF
KEYS, USE THE KEYS TO UNLOCK A
CHEST FULL OF SANDBAGS.
YOU'LL THEN TRANSPORT THE
SANDBAGS ACROSS A BALANCE BEAM.
WHEN YOU GET TO THE FINISH,
YOU'LL USE A GIANT SLINGSHOT TO
KNOCK DOWN FIVE TARGETS.
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY.
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
TAVUA, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER.
CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME PERSON
IN BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.
TROYZAN SAT OUT IN THE REWARD.
 CIRIE WILL SIT OUT.
 NO, NO, YOU THINK?
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE BALANCE
BEAM.
 NO.
 HOW STRONG ARE YOU?
 I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO IT.
 AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO
IT.
 ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS DECIDE.
 WHATEVER.
 DEBBIE, DEBBIE LET'S ALL GET
A GOOD ATTITUDE.
 I HAVE A BAD ATTITUDE.
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF DEFENDING
MYSELF.
I TOOK GYMNASTICS FOR 10 YEARS
AND MADE IT ACROSS THAT BEAM.
DID ANYBODY NOTICE IT TOOK ME
FOR TWO MINUTES.
SHE WAS ON THERE FOR 10, WITH
ALL COUP DEW RESPECT.
I'M NOT DOING IT.
NOW I'VE DECIDED.
 Jeff: HERE WE GO.
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?
GO!
GOTTA GET UP AND OVER.
MANA FLYING THROUGH IT.

 Jeff: CIERA IS UP FOR MANA.
SARAH POPS UP FOR TAVUA.
IT'S J.T. FOR NUKU.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO SPIN THAT RING
OF KEYS UNTIL IT'S FREE.
 COME ON!
 Jeff: CIERA HAS IT.
HEAD UP, HAILY AND TAI.
TAI NOW GOING TO START WORKING
ON THE LOCK.
J.T. HAS HIS.
CIERA HAS HERS.
IT'S NOW MICHAELA WORKING ON THE
LOCK.
OZZY WORKING ON THE LOCK FOR
TAVUA, AND TAI FOR MANA.
NOW IT COMES DOWN TO HOW QUICKLY
CAN YOU WORK THROUGH THOSE FIVE
KEYS TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE?
 DON'T FORCE IT.
 Jeff: MICHAELA HAS HERS.
START HEADING OVER.
YOU HAVE TO CARRY 100 SANDBAGS
ACROSS THE BALANCE BEAM.
IF YOU DROP A BAG OR YOU TBAWL
FALLOFF, LIKE MICHAELA, YOU HAVE
TO GO BACK.
VARNER GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.
ANDREA AND OZZY FOR TAVUA.
VARNER DROPS.
GOTTA GO BACK.
 BREATHE!
 Jeff: HALI IS ACROSS FOR

SHE'S GOOD.
TAI'S GOT TO GO BACK.
HERE COMES ANDREA FOR TAVUA.
SHE'S GOOD.
MICHAELA STRUGGLING TO HANG ON.
OZZY IS GOOD!
MICHAELA PULLS IT OUT!
TAI FALLS AGAIN.
 YEAH, WELL, I'M GLAD WE
DIDN'T SEND THE GYMNAST.
REALLY, I SERIOUSLY AM.
I'M SO SICK OF HAVING TO DEFEND
MYSELF.
 Jeff: HERE COMES ANDREA
AGAIN.
SHE'S GOOD.
HALI DROPS.
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK.
HERE COMES OZZY AGAIN WITH TWO
BIG HANDFULS.
 GOOD JOB!
 Jeff: ONCE YOU HAVE ALL OF
THEM--
 THERE'S ONE OUTSIDE.
 Jeff: ANDREA HAS THE LAST
OF THEM FOR TAVUA.
TAVUA HAS BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE
ON THE BALANCE BEAM.
THEY'VE GOT ALL THEIR BAGS, AND
A MASSIVE LEAD.
 HERE WE GO!
HERE WE GO!
 Jeff: GO, TAVUA.
TAVUA CAN NOW START FIRING
SANDBAGS AT THEIR TARGETS.
OZZY LAUNCHES FOR TAVUA.
AND JUST MISSES.
HERE COMES HALI WITH MORE BAGS
FOR MANA.
MICHAELA AND VARNER STILL
WORKING SANDBAGS FOR NUKU.
OZZY LAUNCHES AGAIN.
JUST MISSES LOW.
 THIS IS THE LAST.
 Jeff: TAI HAS LAST OF THE
SANDBAGS FOR MANA.
YOU'RE GOOD.
COME UP, GUYS.
GO!
NUKU HAS ALL THEIRS.
GET UP, START FIRING!
 SOMEBODY ELSE.
 Jeff: SARAH NOW IN FOR
TAVUA.
HERE GOES CIERA FOR MANA.
THERE IT IS!
CIERA SCORES THE FIRST FOR MANA.
MANA NOW IN THE LEAD WITH ONE.
CIERA LAUNCHES.
CIERA CONNECTS AGAIN.

CULPEPPER GOING TO COME IN NOW

SARAH GOING TO COME OUT.
HERE COMES OZZY.
CULPEPPER CONNECTS FOR MANA!
MANA NOW WITH THREE!
 OZZY, YOU'RE ON IT.
YOU GOT IT.
 Jeff: YOU CAN SEE OZZY AND
J.T. FEELING THE PRESER PRESSURE
CULPEPPER LOOKING FOR NUMBER
FOUR.
HE'S GOING DEEP.
CULPEPPER HITS THE FURTHEST
TARGET.
THAT IS FOUR FOR MANA.
THEY ARE ONE AWAY FROM WINNING
IMMUNITY.
 KEEP IT GOING!
 Jeff: OZZY CONNECTS WITH
NUMBER TWO.
CULPEPPER DOES IT FOR MANA!
MANA WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL!
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE!
OZZY HITS THE THIRD TARGET FOR
TAVUA.
TAVUA NOW WITH TWO LEFT.
NUKU HAS GOT TO PICK IT UP.
AND HE'S GOT IT.
J.T. WITH THE SECOND TARGET FOR
NUKU.
IT IS NOW 3-2.
TAVUA LOOKING FOR NUMBER 4.
JUST MUSSING.
J.T. CONNECTS.
WE ARE NOW TIED 3-3.
NUKU IS BACK IN THIS.
BOTH TRIBES WITH TWO TARGETS
LEFT.
J.T. HITS TARGET NUMBER FOUR.
OZZY HITS TARGET NUMBER FOUR FOR
TAVUA.
WE ARE TIED AGAIN, 4-4.
GOTTA HIT IT SQUARE!
 GO, GO, GO, GO!
 Jeff: J.T. FOR THE WIN.
NO.
OZZY.
OZZY CONNECTS FOR TAVUA!
TAVUA WINS IMMUNITY SENDING NUKU
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 AMAZING.
 Jeff: MANA,
CONGRATULATIONS.
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM MANA.
TAVUA, CONGRATULATIONS.
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM TAVUA.
MANA, TAVUA, GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.
ALL RIGHT, NUKU, SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
 THE LAST TIME I PLAYED, THE
CHALLENGE THAT WAS TRIBAL
COUNCIL AND SENT ME HOME WAS
SLINGSHOT.
TODAY WAS SLINGSHOT.
THE SAME THING CAN'T HAPPEN TO
ME TWICE.
I HOPE.
I SHOULD HAVE-- I SHOULD HAVE
DONE BETTER SWITCHING IT OUT THE
WHOLE TIME.
 SO WE LOST THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.
THE GOD ARE NOT LOVING NUKU
RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF
THIS TRIBE.
LIKE, THAT'S THE POINT THAT
WE'RE AT.
 I CAN OFFER A LOT, A HELL OF
A LOT MORE THAN MICHAELA CAN.
 I FEEL LIKE MICHAELA HAS TO
BE THE NEXT PERSON TO GO, AND
FOR J.T., WE CAME INTO HIS CAMP.
HE'S DONE HIS JOB.
HE'S BEEN A PART OF US.
 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,
Y'ALL, IT'S BETTER FOR US NOT TO
HAVE MICHAELA.
 I'M 100 BEHIND IT.
 A LOT LESS BABY-SITTING.
A LOT LESS BITTERNESS.
A LOT LESS BAD ENERGY.
A LOT LESS CRY BABY.
AND A LOT LESS SUGAR STEALING.
 SUGAR NABBING
 YEAH, SUGAR NABBING.
I CANNOT THINK OF ONE REASON
ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO KEEP
MICHAELA VERSUS RUNNING WITH ME.
 YOU BETTER NOT HAVE ME
LAUGHING AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 AS LONG AS I KNOW I'M NOT
GOING HOME, I'LL TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT IT.
BUT IF I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
HOME, I WILL SHUT UP.
 WHY WOULD YOU BE SCARED?
 I THINK IT'S PLAIN TO SEE I
HAVE A LOT MORE TO OFFER THAN
SHE DOES.
IF I HAVE TO USE MY IDOL, I
WILL, BUT THEY NEED ME TO WIN
CHALLENGES.
NOTHING WILL BE BETTER THAN
WATCHING MICHAELA GET HER TORCH
SNUFFED.
I THINK SHE LICKED IT!
I SWEAR!
 I MEAN, THAT'S IT FOR THIS
JAR.
 THAT'S IT.
 THIS IS DONE.
 I TOLD YOU, THAT (BLEEP) IS
CRAZY.
 TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WAS FOR J.T. TO WIN FOR HIMSELF,
EXCEPT J.T. DIDN'T KNOW HOW BAD
HE HAD TO WIN.
I NEED TO GET VENGEANCE FOR WHAT
HAPPENED TO MALCOLM.
AND I THINK THAT BETWEEN VARNER,
MICHAELA, AND I, WE MAKE A GOOD
TEAM.
DO YOU THINK AS A TRIBE, WE
COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT J.T.?
 YES, I THINK WE CAN.
 ALL J.T. HAS TO DO IS GET AWB
EXPREE ONE MORE PERSON, AND
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US.
 YEAH.
 BUT I'M GOING TO TALK TO JEFF
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE I
TRUST YOU MORE THAN I TRUST
THOSE TWO.
 YEAH.
SANDRA, VARNER, AND ME MAKE
THREE, WHICH IS ENOUGH TO VOTE
OUT J.T.
I'M READY FOR HIM TO GO HOME.
HE JUST IRRITATING.
 I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE TRUST
IN ME.
THAT'S ALL.
 YEAH.
THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
TO GO OUT OF MY FAVOR I IS EITHE
SANDRA OR JEFF VARNER DECIDING
THAT THEY WOULD RATHER VOTE FOR
ME THAN VOTE FOR J.T.
 THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO
GET TO THE END WITH SANDRA.
BECAUSE ALL I KNOW HOW TO DO IS
GET TO DAY 39.
 OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
I WAS JUST TALKING TO MICHAELA,
BECAUSE J.T. HAS A THING FOR
HER, AND NOW HE'S NOT GOING TO
BE QUIET ABOUT IT.
 RIGHT.
 HE'S GOING TO JUST LEAVE HER
ALONE.
 RIGHT.
 BETWEEN ME, YOU, AND
MICHAELA, WE CAN TAKE OUT J.T.
 TONIGHT, I AM IN A PERFECT
SPOT BECAUSE I CAN CHOOSE TO
VOTE WITH SANDRA AND MICHAELA
AND VOTE OUT J.T.
OR I CAN GO WITH J.T. AND AUBRY,
AND VOTE OUT MICHAELA.
I'D LIKE TO GO BOTH WAYS AT THE
SAME TIME, PLEASE.
WHAT IF J.T. HAS AN IDOL?
ANYBODY CAN HAVE AN IDOL IN THIS
GAME, BUT I WANT TO KEEP
WINNING.
SO IT IS GET RID OF AN ATTITUDE
PROBLEM OR GET RID OF A BIG
THREAT.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, SANDRA, YOU CAME
IN HERE WITH THE NUMBERS, SIX
VERSUS FIVE.
MALCOLM IS BLINDSIDED.
YOU'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT BACK
TO CAMP?
 WE BLAMED J.T.
WE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
GIVEN IT AWAY TALKING WITH
CULPEPPER.
BUT SOMEBODY LEAKED THE NAME
BECAUSE HOW WOULD TAI KNOW WHO
TO GIVE THE IDOL TO?
 Jeff: J.T., YOU HAD TO FEEL
SOME PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU KIND
OF STARTED THAT BALL ROLLING?
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
AND I FELT REALLY GUILTY,
BECAUSE THE LAST PERSON I WANTED
TO GO HOME WAS MALCOLM.
I WAS HINTING AROUND AT
CULPEPPER, ARE WE SAFE?
I SAID YOU'RE SAFE.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU ALL ARE SAFE.
IT WASN'T SABOTAGE.
IT WAS MORE LIKE I GAVE TOO MUCH
INFORMATION AND GOT MYSELF
BURNED, TOO.
 Jeff: MICHAELA, WHAT
HAPPENS NOW TO THE TRIBE
DYNAMIC?
 I WOULD SAY WE WENT FROM
BEING A TRIBE WHERE EVERYONE WAS
ON THE SAME FOOT TO BEING A
TRIBE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO
THINKS HE'S RUNNING (BLEEP) ALL
THE TIME.
 WHOA.
( LAUGHS )
 Jeff: SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE
TALKING ABOUT J.T.
 OF COURSE.
 Jeff: J.T., DOES THIS
SURPRISE YOU, OR ARE YOU GUYS
GOING AT IT?
 IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT
ALL.
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS, EVERYBODY
IS TIRED OF BABY SITTING.
SO CAMP LIFE IS TOUGH.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED TO BE
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
 Jeff: SANDRA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT J.T. IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN
HE SAYS "CAMP LIFE IS TOUGH?"
 WELL, THEIR FEUD STARTED OVER
THE SUGAR BECAUSE J.T. USES
SUGAR FOR HIS COFFEE, AND THERE
WAS NO SUGAR LEFT, SO HE THINKS
MICHAELA ACTUALLY LICKED THE
CONTAINER WHERE THE SUGAR WAS.
( LAUGHING ).
 THIS IS FOR REAL.
 THAT'S HOW STUPID HE IS.
WHAT WOULD I PUT MY TONGUE IN A
SUGAR JAR FOR?
 Jeff: SO IT'S BEEN ON SINCE
THEN.
 EXACTLY.
 Jeff: SO, SANDRA, HOW DO
YOU BASE A VOTE TONIGHT KNOWING
THERE WILL ONLY BE FOUR OF YOU
LEFT?
BECAUSE WHO YOU VOTE OUT IS JUST
AS IMPORTANT AS WHO YOU KEEP
BEHIND.
 WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR
STRONGEST PLAYER IN THE GAME,
AND WITH HIM, WE'RE GOING TO
MOVE FORWARD.
 Jeff: SO, MICHAELA, THAT'S
A CLEAR REFERENCE TO J.T.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO
PRETEND, RIGHT?
 NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE
ARE ACTING LIKE I'M STUPID ALL
DAY.
IT'S SUCH AN INSULT TO MY
INTELLIGENCE.
I'M NOT SURPRISED, BUT IT'S
LIKE, DANG.
 JEFF, I HAVE TO SAY, WE'RE
TIRED OF BABY SITTING.
SHE LAYS IN THAT DAMN SHELTER
ALL DAY LONG AND SAYS, "WILL YOU
GIVE ME SEVEN DROPS OF COFFEE
AND A CUP OF SUGAR?"
 BEING FUNNY.
PAUSE, HAS ANYBODY EVER SEEN ME
WASH DISHES?
 NO.
 SHE HAS WASHED DISHES.
 HAS ANYBODY EVER SEEN ME HELP
PREPARE THE FOOD?
 SHE HAS PREPARED THE FOOD.
 HAS ANYBODY SEEN ME DELIVER
FOOD TO ANYONE ELSE ON A PLATE?
 I HAVE SEEN THAT.
 SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP.
 I EVAPORATE SEEN ANY OF
THOSE, MICHAELAA.
 LIKE I SAID, HE SPEAKS FOR
THE WHOLE TRIBE.
 Jeff: VARNER, DOES J.T.
SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE?
 I THINK MORE OFTEN THAN NORTH
HE DOES.
 Jeff: AUBRY, DOES J.T.
SPEAK FOR YOU?
ARE YOU TIRED OF MICHAELA?
 YEAH, I TRIED REALLY HARD AND
I'M AT A LOSS AT THIS POINT.
 Jeff: SANDRA, DOES J.T.
SPEAK FOR YOU?
ARE YOU TIRED OF MICHAELA?
 J.T. DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ME AS
FAR AS HIS ISSUES WITH MICHAELA,
BUT THE I DO LISTEN TO WHAT J.T.
SAYS.
HE MAKES VALID POINT ABOUT US
MOVING FURTHER IN THE GAME.
 JEFF, SOME OF US AREN'T QUITE
GAME CHANGERS.
SOME OFEROUS JUST FILLING SPACE.
 Jeff: WOW.
AUBRY, YOU SEEM DISTRESSED BY
THIS.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THE TRIBE?
IS IT BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T
LIKE CONFLICT?
WHAT IS IT?
 UM... YEAH.
I GENUINELY LIKE MICHAELA.
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HOW
SHE RUNS HER LIFE, THAT SHE IS
AN INTELLIGENT, INDEPENDENT
FEMALE, BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM THIS
TRIEBLG THAT WE HAVE A QUALITY
OF LIFE ISSUE GOING ON HERE.
 Jeff: VARNER, HOW
COMPLICATED IS TONIGHT'S VOTE OR
IS IT AT ALL?
 IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED.
I MEAN, THERE'S ARGUING GOING ON
AT CAMP, AND THERE'S ARGUING
GOING ON AT CHALLENGES.
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
 Jeff: AUBRY, JUST SINCE
WE'VE BEEN HERE AT TRIBAL, YOU
HAVE FLIP-FLOPPED ON WHICH WAY
YOU WANT TO VOTE?
 THIS VOTE FOR ME HAS BECOME
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.
 Jeff: VERY CLEAR TO YOU,
SANDRA?
J.T.?
 YES, SIR.
 Jeff: AND MICHAELA, CLEAR
TO YOU?
 IT'S NOT LIKE IT MATTERS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.
J.T., YOU'RE UP.
 GOT A LOT TO LEARN, KID.
 FOR THE RECORD, YOU DON'T
THINK FOR ME.
YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME.
I AIN'T YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.
 QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.
ADIOS.
 Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
OKAY.
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.
FIRST VOTE, MICHAELA.
J.T.
ONE VOTE J.T., ONE VOTE
MICHAELA.
MICHAELA.
TWO VOTES MICHAELA.
J.T.
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES J.T., TWO
VOTES MICHAELA, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS," J.T.
 DAMN.
 Jeff: YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.
 TELL MALCOLM YOU SENT HIM
HOME, TOO.
 I WILL.
 Jeff: J.T., THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
 DAMN, YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.
 AND I DIDN'T STEAL THE SUGAR,
EITHER.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WENT.
YOU TOOK THE SUGAR!
 WAY TO GO.
 Jeff: WELL, THIS IS THE
LEVEL OF GAME PLAY YOU EXPECT IN
A SEASON CALL THE "GAME
CHANGERS."
THE ONLY RUB, IS AS WE JUST SAW,
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL
THE GAME IS PLAYED ON YOU.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.
 Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR": NO ONE CAN LET
THEIR GUARD DOWN EVERYBODY DROP
YOUR BUFFS.
BECAUSE THE TWISTS ARE NEVER
ENDING.
 WHAT A CRAZY GAME.
 Jeff: YOU ARE GOING TO
EXILE ISLAND.
ONE CASTAWAY IS LEFT STRANDED.
AND A FORMER SURVIVOR MAKES A
SURPRISE RETURN.
 I GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT
IN MYSELF, AND I DIDN'T BRING MY
IDOL TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE
I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED IT.
I MADE A VERY, VERY FOOLISH
MISTAKE.
I JUST LET MYSELF DOWN BASICALLY
THROUGH THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE.
I THINK I'LL ALWAYS LOVE THE
GAME.
I JUST HATE HOW I PLAYED IT.
I HAD A CHANCE AT $1 MILLION AND
I BLEW IT.
