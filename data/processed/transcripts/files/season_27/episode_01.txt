else that has already played this game
came sorry one sec for like this is my
time this is my game
enough
in survivor Samoa Laura was a mother to
her try
this time so have to split her focus
between her daughter Sierra
in the game I think that our ability to
find a balance each other out
is really gonna benefit
but yet she's my heart
nothing is harder than seeing somebody
that you love saffir








for days playing the game fan favorite
rupert has never made it to the end his
wife Laura hopes to be the first to the
family to win this game

for Laura
after making some controversial
statements and survivor one world
called left with the mysterious ailment
and few fans

him with the maturity he needs
I don't really know how people are gonna
respond what I was like this big Bolla
anger
Michael apart from winning this season
is to show people different side

would can just play the game and
survivor Cook Islands she was a young
med school student now she and her
husband John

fantastic shelter builder

the bat he weakens our track

doing everything I can to save my life
by in this game guys you have a lot to
get started with your building a new
world
each if you have a map your caps head

now I have the opportunity to show all
those dumbasses
how big a mistake they made
on
missed
sticks seats yet
C Tyson run around naked
copper shares
has been 13 years is a place by
i think is the longest layoff anybody's
ever had rainy day
so it's going to be interesting to say
the least I think
I know I'm I'm up for it though amram
candy
I was excited see that we had a box
there with
some supplies in it there anyway now
okay I'm heroes villains I watched and
help from
star fire bamboo alright his name enough
I cannot me
think along is a strong province because
you have a lot to turn a place
one Lawrence not the lock see is
now machinist are on their way awarded
the will
I don't wanna play with Laura has got to
go by
PC link
yeah
showing the returning players try
its very intimidating all these people
are the
experts yeah move your hand out I but
then like I get and tax for
here's practice I've got a lot of
pressure on my back
I have to show how tough I am and how
valuable land to the tribe
so what you have here an hour I know
playing yeah I mean
here stuck to have you I think there's
the expectation that I am
like grouper but I'm not he started
shelter
months ago
from
hits in 6 be an experienced player we
know how important it is
ap bio don't worry about your shelter
don't worry about anything else because
unless you have a fire
we r dead in the water in 15 minutes
tyson
my out there start the fire want to get
the fire hot enough
anything will burn you put in it been
nonstop what's going on water our
canteens our full
guys right now rice
morale is good it's amazing were really
comfortable at this point half
of of
skinny ever let me with chard
I guess if I survivor
not once but wife and both times
compton's out here I mean he was see
hands
one of the most vindictive villainous me
people to ever play the game said
you
theory
C
I played with him before he stabbed me
in the back and
I'm not gonna have happened to me what
happened to me before
steam
mine
nap from as he changed as in I'm
I don't know the zebra change their
stripes
cast MI once again gonna be big numbers
or
I don't know home
having strong before president lot away
I have removed monica's
survivor one experience thousands of
times with
Wilson dropped off on a beach in to
fight world there's nothing here
it's on there were some butterflies
taken here we go
South gonna start
and something about
attitudes his hands his work so we're
all working hard around can boys to make
an
shelter girls are even palm fronds we
have no veterans here so
we're all kinda going on What are not
once told us and basically it was a bit
shocking
we don't know anything of
much educator I feel I can could be in
trouble
five minutes into the game I been a huge
boner about not going on a per cent to
potentially help my wife
now she's now the enemy manager for
really
first moments of the game
I mentioned something about
Thomas it out
from
100 percent yet my blessed
on a per cent
write you back to the field
said he's not going to go to town for
his wife by was in
in apologies exactly so I feel like he's
1 I'm definitely gonna have to
keep my owning he came close because he
seem like he could be a loose cannon
guys
if there's one thing going for Monica
she said Brandon you
play this game you better hit the ground
running
fine you hit the ground running talking
to people you need to make connections
you need to give mines
facts for the team
strong and and fingers travel Council
fear
good idea to keep all the five guys
together stemmed from Brad
waterfall
not surprised at all thanked shocker
together with NFL football once keep his
locker
together he won the game but you know
the more he
part so that kinda stuff and servicers
himself as the leader I mean the
more that could potentially in a body
mass later something can
got the numbers gas of
cool
you about an alliance
from his jeans hmm number
when Brad guy by myself he was
pretty much China buddy buddy the yeah
bro mascot bang
you know all guys the and blah blah blah
southern chic on with his army him
thank and now you're want to get your
yourself and your wife today and whoever
she's with you know I mean I'm not
stupid
missed it sounds good you know whatever
you know I'll agree to anything at this
point with him because I was gonna shut
him up
with you the par-5 guy thing you know
just when the girls
under clinton I can so easily a
beneficial
if you like to keep the strong around
seen these days to john cochran's
a survivor are the big threats now yeah
because because
those people that went through the week
for women john cochran
I think right now John onboard Intel 510
kbps
and I know an hour everybody s I got
kaelin I got John
I got a I got beat I got me that's fine
4 with nine people's
out
but I'm sorry your no okay
more
with 9 people's by
5 with 9 people's
him
something that sounds like to eat 30
shelves together man segment roman tub
sauna
give his own yes i'd singles
every three sizes
which is weird
is the plan and I'm members not to start
a fire without them
became boiler water this is a lot just
building a shelter putting it together
I can feel the liquid leaving my body
and turning into sludge
you
names for three years yes
like free or back good
too young for you this is the his bbw
both Mike
15 Craig I'm sorry getting a married
come down I actually was a teen moms I
got pregnant at 17 and high school
that was a huge game change for me and
my mom
it was %ah are really hard obstacle for
us to get the rooms
embarrassing for my mom probably as at
parent to be so hard
you kid every you know you know I'm sure
to pick up your
my daughter 16 pregnant I embrace earns
a veg
you to convert statement on my mom she
found now
eventually we're back to training
character
worst person ever but now it's awesome
you know now I have my mind and my
husband's great
an hour but Laura your mom thinks being
a grandparent who is way there
repair 10 I wasn't here with the guys
segment top 10 deadbeat dad
the country or something me you're in
jail now 19 year
%uh ducking really how their heroin
addict major
yeah not my brother was a golden child
you know I grew up behind me like what
you can do all these bad things in like
got a scholarship to college basketball
like straight-a student
and I was like after opposite got that a
college
than on street robbing people every day
to get my fix my addiction impact my
family
profound even my relationship with my
brother to this day is still like not
fully mended
so this is a great experience and I get
to have with my brother
the fact that we're going on this
together is a pretty great you know
opportunity for us to men smart finally
got arrest the main route into maybe the
best thing ever happened to you
best thing ever say my life because I
had over just a few times in the last
month Road
for like two cuts family one night in
the bath the gas gas station with
Anderson on
users to power us we're just kidding
you're just a baby
yeah I think in a game where trust is
the most important part
I just wanted to share it might try my
past because you know if you really want
some you trust to you have to let them
in
and I do wanna be vulnerable make show
them
that part of my past make makes me
stronger is
so perhaps check it does a great job
demand strike something
for me I don't think people that hear
about the part about having to think
anything less than me
I don't think people are gonna see
ex-con thats conniving
and it does fee that's willing to like
do whatever he can to get what he wants
like I got fourteen years clean
not a lot of experience away from that
and I do want to show them that there's
like you know different army then like
just being a teacher
and I think it'll help strengthen the
bonds and connections I have with them
and will be able to get for this game
them yeah
this try itself find
for me personally everyone here keeps my
mind off it like the games
you know i mean some other guy forget
that I'm in a game I think I just signed
up for some horrible hellacious
camping trip yeah here
summer play this game I had this math on
I was
brute everyone I was mean to everyone
and I didn't have kind things to say
and it was all because I was in secular
I actually am trying to find an
opportunity
to really try to explain to people and
get them to understand me
where I'm from I A
live lead 99 people and might stay
that have the same beliefs what i'd
don't have
are people that are kalin I live in the
deep south where
being gay it's a cross to bear every
single day
well as growing up I was a three-disc in
the world
and you know I mean somewhere along the
way
I got tired of being called fifty in
faggot queer and they'll
the struggle is just getting people to
understand and a living breathing human
being
just like everybody else I have five
battles
with my own family trying to get them to
understand
and the people in my family that I don't
have a relationship but because they
don't understand that it's like okay
that they love me
and does
home
ok
the negative experiences day you go
through in life I think they bill due to
the person that you are
unit today but I'm times I'm just going
and what positive thinking
guys here on the same cell
he is I is just around the corner
will seem like you for all of us
to judge what decisions he makes
is hard we haven't walked a mile in his
shoes
and I don't think it's easy if these
chains
when happy beautiful story re: I'm
Rd begin scoping company
marked
full
like this
letter to you for every person I
definitely got my feelings hurt
by the returning players try I'm out for
revenge

call are you upset because you think
he's in trouble or just
the fact that you know you just sent
into trouble counts

his belly feeling when all this
do is it's a bittersweet we won that we
put our loved ones in jeopardy

John gets your wife seen a jump Council
upset about you
I mean my jervis for him to come to jump
up and down like in your face has like
pay bozo your loved one may go home when
your cheer about that great guys beat us
but it's like beating your own
home
start 30
yes
we lost challenged in that stinks can
get where I am in life by
losing and I hate to lose fire
be happy workers a silver lining was be
happy they have five round die without
it
but I don't know I know this I don't
think there's a single person here you
can get a hundred percent
person puzzle makers was it up again
you beat yourself up don't yeah I mean
if all they've all done this they know
the experience they weren't as nervous
like this is not the first time that the
related proposal here a discount
experience after the challenger in my
heart sank down to the floor
it's our first challenger first boss I
knew that
I was part of why the team lots I mean I
can buy
my mother and the fact that three of us
the puzzle people
where the reason that we didn't pull
through at the end
you know makes me a little nervous
because what are we to judge their votes
of
or jervis orange and it's not porn
have to use the lower swine that's how
you
Joe did so freaking bad about
spent like go to my face like
I was just like terrorists like calm
down your body to show the year the
weakest
like athletic person on your try with
that swimming performance
I definitely think the other tribal
sovereignty much after that when because
is they are our loved ones like yes he
won but guess what you're about to send
one of us home
and of course who are they gonna corley
jervis with his knee here's one thing on
we're gonna win shall and
let's win grace you know there are Jeff
saying is the line is not war after
kills its prey very rear roaring after
killing occurred
and come look at him and go from that
make me happy
I don't want to gloat over them
because what they're gonna lose a loved
one what we have right now
with us my monette we were down casper's
uncles 524 like
there's seasons were people would kill
to be on the numbers early on
you know you get faster we're not
breaking yeah mysteries computed
nobody's gonna drive soon we can figure
this out amassed
gonna be because whoever we photographed
we gotta remember is gonna be stabbed
our planet
detailed you
I was checked out by the way I'm telling
by Sunday yeah
this like so sad opening kickoff 90
Monica I saw her with a rancher wheels
remain
about now I'm glad she did legal work
that much I think there's there's
such thing as being sorted and and that
was rough
I didn't like I noticed there you
understand being happy that
there's a point we need to be smart
about it because I'm telling you
I'm a little spoiled onerous right now
just because they were jervis act
Marissa performance the challenge
she was a little bit of the radar but
there's a side of myself that's all
jervis jumping up and down kinda in your
face the one is like she's going home
I like them apples jurors really good
doings in Borneo
yeah season on here here here the player
he was then anybody
on the positive cells just one thing
going for teasing be our best best asset
now and I can use like a third wheel
Yahoo we were concerned about her to
with the puzzle bard news
searing kadian and seer really jumped
and shoes shoes really helpful
and the same like Kate issues just the
extra cooking the kids'
here's the thing Okies marked she gets
this year to the puzzle is your
complete I don't wanna see Katie go
by if the majorities and then I am I'm
in with it we do you think you're
keeping track
struck
the girls Valley know that the guys are
bonded I mean we're not being
subtle all of these women so it's
important for me to keep my alliances
with the girl strong I'm gonna tell
those girls K
you guys have decided which one will go
first which is what we want
some the guys
circling than catching
I think
today
let's be honest it doesn't matter
however they choose to vote for because
the guys have definitely bonded with
each other
I mean I feel bad for the girls but at
this point it'd be foolish
to to try to go against that
45 guy strong won the girls has to go
so maybe Marissa maybe Katie
to me they're all people the girls are
both connected with the other trade
we gotta start thinking about who you
vote now potentially
affect their truck
of
tiny chip use a torch gordon Brown the
torch approach the flame
depending get fire
as part of the ritual a tribal council
because in this game
fire represents
life
alright first tribal council
month place you want to beat somebody's
gotta be here came
what's been the toughest part in the
first few days for you tranquil fire
so you guys will i intimidate you don't
have fire yeah we were telling bombs
see are you had to have talked to Mom a
lot about her experiences out here
how much more difficult is it one sure
out here
my mom's tell me stories actually being
out here is
completely different I mean I've never
been this hungry
my okay somebody is just trying to get
outta my stomach right now like
cool I am A in science so to experience
is a really rough
colpepper your three days in and you're
already clearly struggling
it's been very frustrating not making
fire cuz obvious if we had fire we can
get fish incur can get strong silly when
you know community challenges let's talk
about blood versus water
Caleb I was having loved ones on the
party try
change this game it really does
complicated I mean
he doesn't know what's going on over
here just like I don't know what's going
on there you just gotta trust each other
that the show's gonna do the right thing
the right now they're doing their thing
we got to do our John
moments in the day one the woman you
love is the first person voted out to
the other try
you are then given the chance to take
her spot right young any regrets about
not stepping up
I have a lot to get off about decision
as a
as a husband it's something I really
struggle with the net feel like
sis
I just I feel I can spy sitting there in
the downtown thing I just
just slater go and is like water down in
Singapore
some movie should I think he met by the
and sometimes struggling with home
so what's it impact on you knowing that
whoever you vote out tonight
will be competing against your wife in
Rupert in the first 20
redemption if today's challenge species
anything really shows then
our love on the other side are not an
appointee punches
so michael tyson beat a soft lighting is
gonna make
this tribe strong is going for now if
there's an advantage that thing can scan
kick you know members by then that's
great too colpepper
where you see this game go blood versus
while
for you already thinking I think it was
interesting dynamic today when we lost
the CAS I don't know why they're
celebrating so much on there and
when work one of their loved ones going
home
who is celebrating who stood out service
course you're shaking your head at your
own uncle yes because he was celebrating
like that
I think I've been is better and more
mature
wiser so I was expecting them to handle
grace
meatus can it work against you
if your loved one behaves in this way
for somebody who's like
loading in our face like that kinda just
as a little bit insult to injury because
no this twist is different any other
season no team who wins immunity
is worrying the night the other team
goes to trial counsel but I guarantee
you tonight
that team is worrying because when they
see as the next time a challenge
they know that one of their loved ones
gonna be gone
were saying concerned at all by what
leaders said yes because
I'm guilty by association I wish germs
when im heightened down at the moment
so I would feel a little less formal
right now
while I would be devastating to get
voted out in this game
for something you didn't do jungle
exactly
by I feel like people should just be
judging me on my performance my
character my attitude not my love me
it comes down to March try not with
their child is doing weeks we get to
emerge
and then you can decide if you want a
judge me because it has
came where you at for the first phone
you really have solutions to go along I
mean the challenge today I think
the first like to raise the guys did
really great and
the puzzle makers fell behind cell the
fear tonight
face up to the challenge that's one
thing the judge our votes of
so you know there's something would it
be fair to vote you off or one poor
performance in your first
ever survivorship I want peace rights
colpepper
if you have to vote somebody out you
can't find any other reason
then he could be today's challenge yeah
obviously if they have been successful
elevated their level in the tribe right
now but
I don't think we're all judging solely
on the performance
deposit makers
alright it is time to go Kayla Europe
just here
to tally the votes
once votes read the decision is final
person voted down to be asked to leave
the tribal council area me
boats
first row K
worse
worse to vote summers
three months myself 1 okay
process it's four votes mercy
first person voted out a survivor blood
versus what Marissa
that's five just enough for your torch
the
percent trap spoken
will have a chance to get back in this
game torture productions
first tribal council first blindside
your family members have tied
come play this game but the fact that
you're here says that even teacher
good news about come to tribal council
you will now have fire
every torches have back to camp and I
stay tuned for scenes from our next
episode
next time on survival and fifth-seeded
I can't deal with three more days come
by he old
Colton is back he's a bully hopefully
kamli wrapped into K
people stay alive one is going home for
good
