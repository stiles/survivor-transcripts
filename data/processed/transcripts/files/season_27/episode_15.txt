         Jeff: WELCOME TO THE
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. WATER"
REUNION SHOW LIVE IN LOSS
LANG-- LOS ANGELES, A LOT TO
TALK ABOUT.
WE HAVE THE ENTIRE GROUP
FROM THE SEASON, ALL CLEANED
UP, LOOKING SO PRETTY.
PLUS IN THE AUDIENCE WE HAVE
LAST YEAR'S WINNER, JOHN
COCHRAN.








HIS LIFE HAS TAKEN A VERY
BIG AND EXCITING TURN SINCE
WE LAST SAW HIM AND WE'RE
GOING GET THAT UPDATE.
AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU
LIKE WE DID LAST SEASON A
TEASE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
NEXT SEASON TO SEE IF YOU
CAN FIGURE IT OUT.
FIRST WE HAVE A NEW WINNER
AND HIS NAME IS TYSON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
 I THINK TONIGHT I FELL
BACK IN LOVE.








 NONE OF YOU HAVE A CHANCE
IN HELL.
 Jeff: TYSON IS HURT, ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?
 MY SHOULDER POPPED AND I
CAN'T LIFT IT.
 I'M THREAT NUMBER ONE.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.
BUT WHEN RACHEL LEFT, I TOLD
MYSELF IF I WAS GOING TO
STAY I HAD TO GET TO THE
END.
 TYSON SCORE, I DON'T
WANT TO COME OFF AS THE
KINGPIN OR DECISION MAKER, I
AM LIKE THE BIG BAD WOLF.
 TYSON WIN, FINAL
IMMUNITY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: SO FIRST OF ALL
TYSON, CONGRATULATIONS.
WE HAVE LOYAL, LOYAL FANS.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS GAME.
THEY KNOW HOW HARD IT IS.
YOU PLAYED THREE TIMES.
SO WHAT WAS DIFFERENT THIS
TIME?
 YOU KNOW, WITH THE BLOOD
VERSUS WATER THEME, I WENT
OUT THERE JUST TO HAVE FUN
AND LET RACHEL HAVE AN
EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD HAD.
AND SHE COULD CONNECT WITH
ME BETTER.
AND WHEN SHE SACRIFICED FOR
ME, WOULDN'T LET ME GO IN A
TRADE, I TOLD MYSELF I HAD
ALREADY HAD THE EXPERIENCE
OF GETTING VOTED OUT TWICE.
AND FOR ME TO MAKE HER
SACRIFICE WORTH IT, I HAD TO
DEFY-- I HAD TO FIGHT AND
SCRAPE TO GET TO THE END.
ALL THE TIME, 24/7.
 Jeff: AND WAS THAT
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, DID
IT MANIFEST ITSELF INSIDE
YOU AT TIMES WHERE YOU
THOUGHTS MAYBE I WILL BE
RISKY OR MAYBE I WILL TRY
AND DO SOMETHING SILLY.
 YEAH, DEFINITELY.
IT MOSTLY KEPT ME FOCUSED.
AND IT KEPT ME FOCUSED WHEN
OTHER TIMES I PLAY I KIND OF
HAVE, YOU KNOW, BRAIN FARTS
OR JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
I'M SO TIRED, I WILL JUST
RELAX FOR THE DAY.
AND EVERY TIME I WANTED TO
RELAX I SAID NO, I HAVE TO
KEEP FIGHTING.
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS GOING MY WAY.
I REALLY THINK IT HELPED ME
KEEP FOCUSED.
I'M NOT A FOCUSED
INDIVIDUAL.
 Jeff: RACHEL, ARE YOU
SURPRISED HE'S HERE, THAT
YOU HAD THAT BIG OF AN
IMPACT, THAT YOU WERED
INSPIRATION?
 YEAH, I AM.
I HAD MADE THAT DECISION.
I WAS REALLY CONFIDENT ABOUT
DOING THAT AT THE TIME.
BUT AND I ALWAYS KNEW HE HAD
IT IN HIM TO GET TO THE END.
BUT I STILL LEFT THAT GAME
AND STILL WONDERED AND HOPE
ODD, YOU KNOW, THAT I DID
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.
 Jeff: TRY TO TELL ME, I
ALWAYS ASK THIS AT THE LIVE
SHOWS, TO GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO
PLAY BUT TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND DREAM ABOUT IT, THE
PHYSICAL DEMANDS.
NOT JUST WHAT WE SEE WITH
BUG BITES AND TOE NAILS BUT
THE EMOTIONAL, THE MENTAL
FAT AGENCY.
 YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK
VERY MANY PEOPLE OTHER THAN
CALEB SLEPT MORE THAN TWO
HOURS A NIGHT.
 Jeff: GLEN G TO A BIG
SHOT, OF THE WHOLE GROUP.
DID YOU REALLY STAY UP A LOT,
WORRIED, WONDERING WHAT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
 YEAH.
 IT'S HARD TO SLEEP.
 IT'S DIFFICULT TO SLEEP
ON THE BAMBOO AND THEN ON
TOP OF THAT, YOU'VE GOT
STRATEGY RUNNING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD 24/7.
EVERY SINGLE SCENARIO IS
PLAYING THROUGH MY MIND,
WHAT IF SO-AND-SO GETS VOTED
OUT WHAT IF SO-AND-SO WINS
THE CHALLENGE WHAT IS MY
NEXT MOVE.
AND I TRIED HAVE AN A, B AND
C PLAN IN PLACE ALL THE
TIME.
AND SO I WOULD GET LIKE A
HALF HOUR OF SLEEP HERE OR
THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR
A TOTAL OF TWO OR THREE
HOURS.
BUT WHEN I WAS LYING AWAKE
STARING AT THE SKY, ALL I
WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS HOW
CAN I GET ONE STEP FURTHER
WITH THE PEOPLE I NEED TO.
 Jeff: AN I GOT TO SAY, I
LIKE THIS-- NOT THAT I DON'T
LIKE THE OTHER TYSON.
 YEAH, I HATE THAT GUY.
 Jeff: WELL, YOU CAN
BE-- BECAUSE YOU JUST CIRCLE,
CIRCLE WITH SARCASM, I LIKE
NOW THAT IT IS OVERSEEING
THIS GUY WHO CAN CLEARLY
FORM A SENTENCE AND STAY ON
TRACK AND HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL
GIRL FRIEND.
 RIGHT, SCORE.
 Jeff: WELL, MONICA MADE
IT TO THE END TAP.
AND ALTHOUGH SHE ONLY
RECEIVED ONE VOTE IN THE
FINAL TRIBAL, SHE IMPRESSED
A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS SEASON
WITH HER DOMINATING PHYSICAL
PLAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
 ALL RIGHT THIS ONE IS FOR
THE KIDS.
 Jeff: MONICA, THE ONLY
WOMAN IN THE CHALLENGE.
 NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE
BRAD ANY MORE, I HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT ME.
 Jeff: MONICA HAS IF!
 I'M SHEER TO SHOW THE
KIDS MORE THAN ONE BAD ASS
LIVES IN OUR HOUSE.
 Jeff: TYSON IS OUT,
MONICA WINS HER SECRETARY
IMMUNITY IN THIS GAME.
 THAT MONICA IS GOING TO
SIT IN MED YOK RIT, SHE DIED
IN SAMOA.
 Jeff: MONICA WINS HER
THIRD INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 PEACE OUT JSES FOR ITS
KIDS!
(APPLAUSE)
 MONDAY CA, I THINK IT'S
FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU AND
BRAD BOTH, YOU'RE COMPELLING,
POLARIZING, CONTROVERSIAL.
PEOPLE EITHER LOVE YOU OR
LOVE TO HATE YOU OR LIKE HIM
BUT DON'T LIKE YOU OR LOVE
YOU BUT DON'T LIKE HIM.
I MEAN IT GOES ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
BUT ONE CONSISTENT THING
WITH PEOPLE THIS SEASON AS
EACH EPISODE CAME ON, YOU
EARNED MORE AND MORE AND
MORE RESPECT.
AND YOU KEPT SAYING I'M
DOING THIS FOR ME.
AND I'M DOING IT TO SHOW THE
KIDS.
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR LIFE
THAT YOU NEEDED THE KIDS TO
KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN ONE
BAD ASS AS YOU SAID IN THE
SHOW.
 WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE
NICE COMPLIMENT, TO START.
IT TOOK UNTIL I ACTUALLY
WATCHED THE SHOW AND WATCHED
THE EDIT THAT I THOUGHT, YOU
KNOW, WHAT WAS SURVIVOR
ABOUT FOR ME.
IT WAS ABOUT AS A YOUNG
WOMAN YOU-- A YOUNG CHILD
YOU HAVE A DREAM OF WHAT
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN
YOU GET MARRIED AND SPENDED
REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH
SOMEONE.
AND BRAD HAS SURPASSED EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DREAMS.
AND THE LIFE THAT WE BUILT
TOGETHER WITH THOSE THREE
KIDS, IS PRICELESS.
AND I FOUGHT SO HARD AND
WORKED SO HARD IN ALL THE
CHALLENGES TO JUST SORT OF
SAY THANK YOU.
AND THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU
MADE THIS GREAT TIME FOR US,
I'M STILL THAT GRITTY LITTLE
COED THAT CAUGHT YOUR EYE AT
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA 23
YEARS AGO.
AND I HAVEN'T MET ANY OF
THIS GO TO MY HEAD.
AND I LOVE YOU.
SO THANK YOU.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: SO WE HAVE BEEN
STARTING TO GET SOME TWITTER
QUESTIONS IN FROM OUR
AUDIENCE.
BILLY GIRL WANTS TO KNOW SO
WHAT DID YOUR KIDS SAY.
THEY'RE AT HOME, WATCHING
WEEK BY WEEK.
 YOU KNOW, THE KIDS SAID
THIS MOM, WE'RE SO PROUD BUT
WE'RE NOT SURPRISED.
AS A MOTHER, I THINK EVERY
MOTHER IS A ROCK STAR TO HER
KIDS WHETHER SHE PLAYS
SURVIVOR OR SHE DOESN'T.
 Jeff: SO WHAT WAS THE
EMOTIONAL WEAR AND TEAR,
BECAUSE WE JUST SAW IT.
BY THE TIME WE GET TO DAY 39
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.
HOW HARD WAS THAT FOR YOU?
BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO GET
VERY PERSONAL.
 YOU KNOW, JEFF, FROM THE
VERY FIRST INWALK REDEMPTION
ISLAND, IT HURT ME MORE THAN
IT HURT BRAD HOW HE WAS
ATTACKED.
AND I FELT LIKE FROM DAY
THREE TO DAY 39.
I WAS JUST PUMMELED.
AND I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO
NORMALLY GETS DOWN AND THE
CRYING, IT WAS VERY
DIFFICULT.
 Jeff: I WANT TO POP-- WHO
IS THE PERSON THAT WAS
TALKING TO-- YOU, YEAH, WE
WERE TALKING BEFORE THE
SHOW.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME.
>v FIKKI.
 Jeff: YOU WERE TALKING TO
ME ABOUT MONICA AND HER OUT
THERE.
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE ON HOW
SHE PLAYED AND WHY DID YOU
HAVE SUCH A CONNECTION.
 I JUST FELT THAT MONICA
STAYED TRUE TO HERSELF THE
ENTIRE GAME JUST BY WHAT HER
TRIBE MATES MIGHT HAVE SAID
ABOUT HER OR SAID TO HER, IN
ADDITION TO HER HUSBAND.
AND SHE DOMINATED CHALLENGES
AND SHE DESERVED TO BE
THERE.
 Jeff: YOU FELT BRAD WAS
HARD ON HER TOO.
 AT TIMES, YES.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU
KNOW, THEY HAVE THAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH
OTHER.
AND I THINK THAT THEY KNEW
THEY WERE IN A GAME
SITUATION.
SO-- .
 Jeff: THANK YOU, SO BRAD,
WHAT IS THAT LIKE FOR YOU TO
SEE MONICA, YOU KNOW, HAVING
ALL THESE PEOPLE SAY ALL
THESE COMMENTS ABOUT HER.
 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT,
JEFF.
AND WATCHING THE EDIT WAS
TOUGH.
MONICA IS ONE TOUGH COOKIE.
I KNOW SHE CAN HANDLE IT AND
I KNOW SHE SHOE IT WAS A
GAME AND EVERYBODY WAS
TRYING TO BEAT HER.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, REX,
JUDGE, HONOR, MYSELF, WE
HAVE KNOWN THAT MORE THAN
ONE BAD ASS LIVES IN OUR
HOUSE FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE
SURVIVOR.
 THANK YOU, BABE.
 I LOVE YOU MORE NOW THAN
I EVER DID WHEN WE GOT
MARRIED.
 Jeff: WE KNOW YOU GUYS
COMPLETE EACH OTHER.
WE DO, WE LOVE IT GERVASE, I
HAVE TO MOVE ON TO GERVASE.
 ONE MORE THING, VYTAS,
THIS IS WHAT IT IS LIKE AT
TRIBAL.
 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
I KEEP TALKING, ASKING
QUESTIONS AND BRAD AND
MONICA ARE HAVING THEIR OWN
CONVERSATION.
YOU ROCK.
GERVASE, THE BIG QUESTION I
GOT WITH YOU FROM PEOPLE ON
THE STREET WAS WHY DIDN'T
YOU TAKE A LEADERSHIP-- A
MORE VISIBLE LEADERSHIP
ROLE.
STRATEGICALLY YOU HAD TO
HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH THAT.
 WELL, IT'S HARD.
I MEAN WHEN WE WERE IN
GALANG ARAS WAS KIND THE
LEADER OF THE TRIBE.
YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO LEADERS,
ONLY ONE.
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ARAS'S
LEAD.
WHEN ARAS WENT AND IT WAS
TYSON, IT WAS MY STRATEGY,
LOOK, TYSON IS IN THE FRONT,
SO IF ANYBODY WANTED TO TAKE
OUT OUR ALLIANCE, THEY ARE
GOING TO GO FOR TYSON FIRST
WHICH GIVES ME THREE DAYS TO
COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN.
TO ME THAT WAS SMART GAME
PLAN.
 Jeff: SO ALONG THE GAME
ARE YOU THINKING I CAN STILL
WIN EVEN THOUGH THE
PERCEPTION IS HE'S THE
LEADER.
OR ARE YOU THINKING AT SOME
POINT SOMETHING IS GOING TO
HAVE TO BREAK FOR ME TO
SLIDE IN.
 YEAH, I THOUGHT I COULD
WIN, BUT I ALWAYS HAD THE
PLAN OF GETTING RID OF TYSON
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD.
I'M SORRY, BRO, I LOVE YOU,
BUT I WAS.
IT HAD TO BE THE RIGHT
MOMENT.
LIKE TYSON, WHEN I WAS
TRYING TO GET RID OF ARAS HI
NO WAY TO DO TESTIMONY.
I COULDN'T TALK TO TINA.
 Jeff: SO YOU KNEW WHAT
YOU WERE DOING.
 TYSON CAME TO ME AND SAID
DOW WANT TO GOT RID OF ARAS,
I WAS THINKING THE SAME
THING, LET'S DO IT IT WAS
HARD BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I COULD TRUST CALEB,
HAYDEN, CIERA, BECAUSE WOULD
THEY GO FOR ME NEXT IT WAS
KIND OF I WAS BACKING MYSELF
INTO THE CORNER, MAN.
 Jeff: WHICH SPEAK OF HOW
DIFFICULT THIS GAME IS, YOU
GOT TO THE END BUT
EVERYTHING HAS TO LINE UP.
CIERA, TWO OF THE BIGGEST
MOVES THIS SEASON WERE MADE
BY YOU.
(APPLAUSE)
AND I GOT TO SAY, IT REALLY
SURPRISED ME BECAUSE WHEN IT
STARTED I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOAST.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE
EARLY.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
DRAWING OF THE ROCKS.
DID IT REALLY HAPPEN AT
TRIBAL LIKE IT FELT IT DID
TO ME.
 IT TOTALLY HAPPENED AT
TRIBAL.
AND IT WAS CRAZY, CRAZY.
I MEAN I'M SITTING HERE
THINKING, LIKE, OKAY, CIERA
ARE YOU PROOR.
LIKE AM I REALLY POOR, WHEN
IT HIT ME IN MY MIND THAT I
DIDN'T COME HERE FOR FOURTH
PLACE, I CAME HERE TO TO
WIN.
I THOUGHT AM I GOING TO PLAY
TO FOUR, GO HOME AND THEN
WISH LIKE DUDE, YOU SHOULD
HAVE MADE A MOVE WHEN YOU
HAD THE CHANCE.
SO I JUST THOUGHT I'M GOING
GO FOR T TRY TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE, MAYBE WIN SOME JURY
VOTES, MAYBE GO HOME.
 Jeff: IF YOU EVER GET ON
THIS SHOW, THAT IS HOW YOU
PLAY, RIGHT THERE.
YOU DON'T PLAY FOR FOUR OR
FIVE OR TO MAKE THE JURY.
YOU PLAY TO WIN.
HAYDEN, YOU, THAT WAS ONE OF
THE BEST JOBS AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.
BECAUSE SEASON AFTER-- I
WOULD SAY EVERY THIRD OR
FOURTH SEASON SOMEBODY
DEBATES WE MIGHT GO TO
ROCKS.
BUT NOBODY CAN EVER SELL
THEM ON IT YOU REALLY
SOLD-- WERE YOU-- WERE YOU
PLANNING THAT?
OR DID YOU PICK UP WHEN
GERVASE SAID YOU'RE FOUR.
 NO, I MEAN-- I KNEW GOING
INTO TRIBAL MY BACK WAS
AGAINST THE WALL.
I WAS GOING HOME.
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GO INTO
THAT SCENAR JOB, WE'RE
PLAYING FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS.
YOU SWING FOR THE FENCES.
AND I'M THINKING OKAY, IF I
CAN FORCE A ROCK DRAW, I GOT
A CHANCE.
I WENT IN, GERVASE SAID
SOMEHOW, SOME WAY HE
MENTIONED CIERA BEING FOUR,
MAN CA MENTIONED IT, I
MENTIONED IT, YOU MIGHT AS
WELL COME WITH ME, YOU CAN
BE THREE.
 Jeff: THE OTHER BIG MOVE
YOU FULFILLED THE PROMISE OF
BLOOD VERSUS WATER WHEN YOU
VOTED OUT YOUR MOM.
AND THERE'S A SCENE FOR ME
WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
OF THE WHOLE SEASON, A LOT
OF MOMS TALKED TO ME ABOUT
IT AND THAT WAS WHEN LAURA
YOU EXPLAINED WHAT IT WAS
LIKE TO WATCH YOUR DAUGHTER
GROW UP IN FRONT OF YOUR
EYES, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT
GETTING RID OF YOU.
IT'S WORTH ANOTHER LOOK.
GO AHEAD.
 TO HEAR MY DAUGHTER SAY,
THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO
DO MOM, AS AN INDIVIDUAL
PLAYER IN THE GAME.
OH NOT BUT AS A MOTHER, IT
MAKES ME PROUD BECAUSE
ULTIMATELY FOR ME, I WANTED
THIS GAME TO TEACH MY
DAUGHTER HOW STRONG SHE IS.
(APPLAUSE)
 Schieffer: .
 Jeff: SO WHAT DID THAT DO,
YOU'RE BOTH MOMS.
CIERA, YOU WERE REALLY OPEN
AND VULNERABLE ABOUT
EXPLAINING THAT YOU WERE A
YOUNG MOM, AND HOW MUCH YOU
HAVE GROWN.
AND YOU'RE STILL A YOUNG
WOMAN WATCH.
DID IT DO TO THIS
RELATIONSHIP.
BECAUSE IT LOOKED AT SOME
POINT LIKE THERE WAS A ROLE
REVERSAL.
SHE STARTED TO MENTOR YOU.
 THERE YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY
WAS.
I WAS ON REDEMPTION ISLAND
FOR 7 DAYS SO I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS GOING ON.
I HAD TO TRUST MY DAUGHTER'S
DISCERNMENT TO TELL ME WHAT
IS GOING ON IN THIS GAME.
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD ANY
CONTACT WITH ANYBODY.
SO IT WAS A COMPLETE ROLE
REVERSAL.
 Jeff: ARE YOU CLOSER?
 I DON'T KNOW IF WE EVER
COULD BE ANY CLOSER.
WE'RE CLOSE.
 I THINK THAT THE ROLE
REVERSAL JUST ADDED A NEW
ELEMENT TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.
I DON'T THINK THAT IT REALLY
MADE US CLOSER, JUST MORE
RESPECT, HER FOR ME.
 ABSOLUTELY MORE RESPECT
FOR HER.
AND I THINK AMERICA SAW WHY
THERE WAS SO MUCH DRAMA WAS
THEY SAW THE TUG OF US, THAT
WE WANT TO BE FIRST.
I TAUGHT HER, WE DON'T PLAY
FOR FOURTH, WE PLAY FOR
FIRST.
AND THEY SAW THE TUG OF
THAT.
 Jeff: AND SHE TAUGHT YOU
THAT PLAYING IS WHAT
MATTERS.
NOT WHERE YOU FINISH IS
GIVING THE EFFORT IT WAS A
BEAUTIFULLING I LOVED HAVING
YOU GUYS OUT THERE.
 ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT, THIS
GUY IS ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR TO EVER PLAY
SURVIVOR.
AND HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF SO
HIS WIFE COULD PLAY.
AND THIS GUY IS MAYBE ONE OF
THE MOST des PIECED TO EVER
PLAY SURVIVOR AND INSTEAD OF
SACRIFICING TO HELP HIS
PARTNER, HE JUST QUIT
LEAVING HIS PARTNER ALL
ALONG.
RUPERT AND COLTON ARE NEXT.
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT YOU ARE CRYING
ABOUT?
 I CAN'T DO THIS.
 Jeff: WE BROUGHT A
QUITTER BACK AND WE GOT A
QUITTER AGAIN.
 I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
YOU ALL SAY.
 YOU CAN WIN THIS GAME.
I CAN'T WIN.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SURVIVOR BLOOD VERSUS WATER
LIVE REUNION SHOW.
ALL RIGHT, COLTON.
SO LET'S REVIEW.
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED I
WAS.
 ON A TRIBE OF ALL MEN.
 Jeff: OKAY, SO THAT'S THE
REASON IT DIDN'T GO.
 WELL SURE.
 Jeff: OKAY.
THE SECOND TIME I PLAYED I
WAS --
 ON THE OPPOSITE TRIBE OF
CALEB OR ON TRIBE AARP.
 Jeff: YOU KNOW IT'S
INTERESTING, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW THIS WAS GOING TO GO.
AND FOR SOME REASON I STILL
ROOT FOR YOU AS A PERSON BUT
AS AN AMBASSADOR OF THE SHOW,
I MEAN YOU'VE QUIT, YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE NOT PERFORMED.
OKAY, YOU'VE QUIT ONCE AND
YOU HAD A MEDICAL EVACUATION,
OKAY.
BUT I THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT
YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING JOKES
ABOUT AARP WHEN THE AARP
KICKED YOUR ASS AND STAYED
OUT THERE THE ENTIRE TIME.
(APPLAUSE)
AND I'M TELLING YOU, COLTON,
TOTAL HONESTY, WE TALKED A
WEEK AGO, I SAID YOU CAN
REDEEM OR BURY
YOURSELF WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO DO.
SO WHAT IS THE DEAL.
YOU HAVE THIS GUY IN CALEB
THAT EVERYBODY ADORES.
AND I'M SURE IT MUST HURT
WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DOES HE
SEE IN YOU, AND THAT STUFF.
WHAT IS IT,?
BECAUSE IT WASN'T THAT
DIFFICULT THIS WAS ONE OF
THE MOST EASIEST SEASONS OF
SURVIVOR, IF THERE CAN BE
SUCH A THING.
SO IT WASN'T-- MARISSA, YOU
DON'T KNOW, JUST TELLING
YOU.
I'M SAYING THERE WASN'T THIS
RAIN IT WASN'T THIS HORRIBLE
DEAL WHY DID YOU QUIT, WHY
DID YOU QUIT FOR THE FIRST
TIME.
 OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT I
FIGURED OUT AFTER TWO
SEASONS.
BASICALLY MY ENTIRE LIFE I
HAVE-- I FELT LIKE I NEEDED
OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF
ME.
AND I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED FOR
OTHER PEOPLE, LIKE WHETHER
IT BE MY MOM OR CALEB OR YOU
KNOW N MY FIRST SEASON,
WOMEN.
AND SO WHEN THOSE WEREN'T
THERE, I JUST FREAKED OUT.
AND SO WHAT I FINALLY
FIGURED OUT IS I HAVE TO BE
ENOUGH FOR ME.
I HAVE TO, WHEN THINGS GET
TOUGH AND WHEN THINGS GET
HARD, I HAVE TO DIG DOWN
DEEP AND I HAVE TO PULL UP
MY CAJUNES AND SAY I AM A
MAN, I CAN DO THIS AND I CAN
PERSEVERE ON.
 Jeff: CALEB, WHAT DO YOU
SEE IN COLTON THAT WE DON'T?
WHAT ARE WE MISSING?
NO, I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A
JAB, I MEAN WHAT DON'T WE
SEE?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU PUT
SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE
WILDERNESS AND I MEAN HE
LIKES TO STAY INSIDE.
HE LIKES TO RUN THE AIR
CONDITIONER, DOWN IN THE
SUMMERTIME AND THE HEAT HIGH
IN THE WINTERTIME.
HE LIKES TO BE COMFORTABLE.
AND HE LIKES TO HAVE THREE
MEALS A DAY AND ALL THIS
STUFF YOU KNOW, YOU THROW
SOMEBODY OUT THERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE OR ON A
BEACH, THEN YOU PUT US
TOGETHER, AND HE'S GOT ME
THERE I AM A SECURITY PLAN
KECHLT HE CAN SLEEP ON ME
INSTEAD OF SLEEPING IN THE
DIRT.
AND THEN YOU RIP ME AWAY
FROM HIM.
HE'S GOING TO GO INTO PANIC
MODE.
HE'S GOING TO FREAK OUT JUST
A LITTLE BIT.
SO I DON'T KNOW, I THINK YOU
TAKE ALL THESE THINGS AWAY
FROM ANYBODY AND THEY'RE
GOING TO CHANGE.
SOMETHING'S GOING TO
GET-- THEY'RE GOING GET
GRUMPY.
I JUST GOT T I'M NOT TRYING
TO CUT YOU OFF.
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP GOING ON
THE LIVE SHOW.
I WANT TO CONTRAST THIS NOW
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
TWO OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY.
AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO FULFILL IT.
AT THE OTHER END OF THE THE
SPECTRUM, GOING BACK TO THE
FIRST TIME YOU PLAYED WHICH
WAS IN PANAMA IN SEASON 7,
HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR SURVIVOR PLAYERS
EVER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MOMENTS IT INTO BLOOD VERSUS
WATER, HE SHOWED US WHY WHEN
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF SO HIS
WIFE COULD PLAY.
TAKE A LOOK.
 LET'S PUT BLOOD VERSUS
WATER TO ITS FIRST TEST.
RUPERT, LOVE YOUR WIFE.
YOU CAN TAKE HER SPOT AT
REDEMPTION ISLAND.
 I WOULD RATHER HAVE
MYSELF IN THIS POSITION THAN
I WOULD MY WIFE.
BUT IT'S KILLING ME.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: RUPERT, DOES THE
GAME PLAYER IN YOU, IS THERE
ANY PART OF YOU THAT REGRETS
THAT.
 OH, GOSH, NO, I DON'T
REGRET IT A SECOND.
I WATCHED THAT, AND I SEE OH
MY GOSH, IT MAKES ME JUST
SAD AGAIN THAT THEY PUT MY
WIFE IN THAT POSITION.
I WANTED TO PROTECT AND SAVE
MY WIFE.
 Jeff: LET'S ALL DO IT.
AW!
 I LOVE THE GAME BUT MY
WIFE COMES FIRST.
 Jeff: STRATEGICALLY,
STRATEGICALLY, GOOD MOVE?
 YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING AN
INTERVIEW THE OTHER DAY AND
A GUY ASKED ME, HE SAID THAT
IS THE SILLIEST MOVE IN THE
WORLD.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO WIN THE GAME.
AND I SAID YOU MUST NOT BE
MARRIED.
FOR MY LIFE AND MY WIFE AND
MYSELF, THAT WAS THE ONLY
MOVE THAT I HAD.
 Jeff: GIVEN THAT RUPERT
HAS PLAYED, AS YOU SAID SO
MANY TIMES, AND KIND YOU PUT
YOU THROUGH THIS HE LEAVES
AND YOU HAVE TO RUN THE
HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING, DOES THIS GIVE
YOU PERSPECTIVE NOW ON WHAT
IT IS LIKE BECAUSE WERE YOU
OUT THERE QUITE AWHILE.
 DEFINITELY, I'M PROUD OF
MYSELF.
BECAUSE MAKING IT 20 DAYS.
WE DID HAVE SURVIVOR LIGHT,
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE
TORRENTIAL RAINS WE HAD IN
PANAMA.
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M THRILLED
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO
PLAY.
AND I HAD A GREAT TIME.
 AND SHE DID GOOD.
 I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT HE
GAVE UP HIS GAME.
I MEAN THAT WAS A HUGE MOVE.
HE COULD HAVE WON.
 Jeff: HOW LONG YOU HAVE
BEEN MARRIED.
 16 YEARS.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
WHY, RIGHT.
 YUP.
 Jeff: HAPPY WIFE, HAPPY
LIFE.
MOMENTS AFTER COCHRAN WON
SURVIVOR PHILIPPINES, IT WAS
LITERALLY THE LAST LIVE
SHOW.
HIS WIFE TOOK AN UNEXPECTED
BUT-- TURN, I THINK YOU WILL
BE INTERESTED IN WHAT
HAPPENED.
PLUS VYTAS AND ARAS, AN EPIC
TALE, THE GOLDEN CHILD
VERSUS THE REFORM BAD BOY,
IT PLAYED OUT IN FRONT US.
BUT FIRST, WHAT ARE WE GOING
DO NEXT SEASON.
WE DID THIS LAST YEAR, WE
ASKED YOU TO TWEET AND TELL
US WHAT YOU THOUGHT.
HERE IS A HINT FOR NEXT
SEASON.
 THAT'S IT!
#SURVIVOR FINALE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK, IT'S
THE SURVIVOR BLOOD VERSE
WATER LIVE REUNION SHOW.
A LOT OF YOU WERE GUYING
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT
SEASON.
SOME OF THE GUESSES COMING
IN TWITTER ARE VERY FUNNY
AND SOME ARE RIGHT.
SO I LIKE THAT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF SHOW TO GET
TO.
BUT I WANT TO DO AN UPDATE
ON SOMETHING I THINK YOU'LL
FIND PRETTY INTERESTING.
LAST YEAR'S WINNER, STAND UP
HERE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 FANTASTIC, JEFF.
 Jeff: SO DURING YOUR LIVE
SHOW WHICH WAS JUST LAST MAY
I ASKED YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID, TAKE A
LOOK.
YOU RECENTLY GRADUATED
HARVARD LAW, LAWYER?
 I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO BE A LAWYER.
SURVIVOR DID MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE, IT'S SO CONDITIONEE, I
FEEL STUPID EVEN SAYING-- .
 Jeff: WHAT'S THE DREAM.
 I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE IN
SOME CAPACITY.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE GIFT
OF GAB.
 Jeff: YOU DO.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU PUT IT OUT
THERE YOU WANT TO WRITE.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
 I PUT IT OUT THERE AND
LITERALLY AN HOUR AFTER THE
FINALE ENDS CBS GETS A CALL
FROM COMEDIC GENIUS, HE
WANTED TO MEET WITH ME TO
POSSIBLY WRITE FOR HIS NEW
CBS SIT KORJS THE MILLERS.
TWO WEEKS LATER ABANDONED
MY LAW SCHOOL AND MOVED TO
L.A. AND NOW I'M SOME
SCHMUCK WRITING FOR BILL
ARNOTT AND BOW
BRIDGES-- IT'S INSANE BUT A
DREAM COME TRUCHLT THE PAST
SEVEN MONTHS OF MY LIFE HAVE
BEEN A SERIES OF DREAMS
COMING TO AND WORKING FOR
THE MILLERS IS THE LATEST
ONE.
 Jeff: YOU WERE NICE
ENOUGH, YOU ACTUALLY SHOT
SOME BEHIND THE SCENES TO
GIVE US INSIGHT INTO HOW IT
IS GOING.
 THIS IS A VIDEO GOING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TAKE A
LOOK.
 COCHRAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 YOU WANTED TO TALK.
 HOW ARE YOU LIKE WRITING
ON THE SHOW.
 I'M LOVING IT.
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE
PEOPLE --
 SHH, SHH.
 PEOPLE LIKE YOU TOO MUCH.
THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING YOU
ABOUT THE WRITER WHO WON
SURVIVOR.
WHAT AM I -- WHEN AM I
SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT
MYSELF.
 I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A
THREAT.
 WELL, YOU ARE A THREAT.
EVEN MY AGENT AGREES.
LOOK WHAT HE SENT OVER TO
START WEARING.
SORRY, COCHRAN, YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE.
 OH, COME ON.
THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
ROOM FOR TWO SWEATER VESTS
ON THE MILLERS.
 THE FIRST PERSON VOTED
OFF THE MILLERS IS --
 I'M TO THE GOING ANYWHERE,
THIS WEEK, ARNETT.
LOOK WHAT I FOUND?
 I HID IN THE LADIES ROOM.
 THE MEN'S ROOM'S OCCUPIED.
AND I REALLY HAD TO GO.
 WELL PLAYED, COCHY, WELL
PLAYED.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: NICE!
 IT'S UNREAL, RIGHT.
 Jeff: ALSO I JUST WANT
TO-- GREG IS RIGHT HERE, THE
CREATOR OF THE SHOW, HOW IS
COCHRAN DOING.
 HE'S DOING GREAT.
WHEN HE'S NOT WRITING JOKES
HE'S LOOKING FOR IDOLS SO I
THINK HE'LL BE AROUND FOR A
LONG TIME.
 Jeff: AN ITS MILLERS AIRS
ON CBS AT WILL:-- K8 30 ON
THURSDAY NIGHT, COCHRAN,
HAVE A SEAT, NICE JOB.
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF THE MOST
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS ON
THIS SEASON WAS THE SIBLING
RIVALRY BETWEEN ARAS AND
VYTAS.
AND IT ALL CAME TO A HEAD
WITH A VERY COMPETIVE
BAT-- COMPETITIVE BAD NELL
THE WATER.
TAKE A LOOK.
ARAS GOES OUT QUICKLY, VYTAS
FLIPS, ARAS HAS HIS OLDER
BROTHER DOWN.
 ARAS GIVING HIS BROTHER
ANOTHER SHOT.
BIG SPORTSMAN LIKE MOVE,
VYTAS TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE.
ARAS DEFEATS HIS OLDER
BROTHER.
(APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: SO ARAS, LET'S
START WITH YOU.
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME, I
HAVE TWO BROTHERS.
SO I CORRELATE TO THE
BROTHER RELATIONSHIP.
IT DID SEEM LIKE YOU WANTED
TO HEAL, YOU REALLY WANTED
TO SAY LET'S USE THIS TIME
AND LET'S GET CLOSER.
DID THAT HAPPEN?
 YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK
THAT IN OUR LIFE VYTAS AND I
HAVEN'T HAD TOO MANY THINGS
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE
LEDGERING TO.
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SOMETHING
WE TALK ABOUT FOR YEARS AND
YEARS AND YEARS UNTIL WE
GROW OLD.
AND I CAN'T SAY IT'S ALL
ROSES ALL THE TIME NOW THAT
WE'VE DONE IT BUT WE GOT ONE
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE.
AND THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW, HE TOOK A CHEAP
SHOT AT ME BUT I GOT HIM
BACK BECAUSE I GOT A BUNCH
OF TWITTER FOLLOWERS SO I
HAVE MORE FOLLOWERS THAN HIM,
I'M LEARNING FROM HIM A
LITTLE BIT.
 Jeff: SFLOITAS TYPICALLY
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE I
WOULD ASK YOU THIS QUESTION.
AND YOU WOULD SAY IT'S NOT
QUITE AS ROSY AS MY BROTHER
WANTS IT TO BE.
 YEAH, I MEAN, YOU HAVE
BROTHERS YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
AND WE'RE REALLY CLOSE IN
AGE.
I THINK OUR RIVALRY HAS JUST
BECOME A LITTLE MORE
HEALTHY.
IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW, AFTER
WE LEFT THE PHILIPPINES, I
REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE
TIGHTER THAN WE HAD EVER
BEEN AND WE HADN'T FOUGHT IN
SO LONG AND SO CLOSE.
THE DAY WE GOT BACK WE GOT
THERE A FIGHT AND PROBABLY
DIDN'T TALK FOR TWO WEEKS
AGAIN.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO.
I LOVE MY BROTHER BUT WE'RE
BROTHERS AND THERE'S ALWAYS
GOING TO BE THAT LITTLE BIT
OF COMPETITIVE NATURE.
AND I THINK THAT AFTER GOING
AT IT LIKE WE DID ON
SURVIVOR WE CAN LAUGH AT IF
A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE MORE
PERSPECTIVE.
 Jeff: TWITTER QUESTION
FOR YOU, VYTAS, WOULD YOU
PLAY AGAIN.
 I LOVE THIS GAME.
I WOULD TOTALLY PLAY AGAIN.
I MEAN I'M A FAN.
 Jeff: THE SAME GUY
ACTUALLY ASKED VYTAS AND
HAYDEN, WOULD YOU PLAY
AGAIN.
YOU PLAYED BIG BROTHER, NOW
YOU'VE PLAYED SURVIVOR.
WOULD YOU PLAY SURVIVOR
AGAIN?
 ABSOLUTELY, YOU HAVE TO.
AND IT'S AN AWESOME GAME.
A CHANCE TO COME OUT AND WIN
A MILLION DOLLARS.
 Jeff: BIGGEST DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SURVIVOR AND BIG
BROTHER?
 PHYSICAL, THE PHYSICAL
DIFFERENCE.
SURVIVOR IS PHYSICALLY WAY
HARDER.
BIG BROTHER MAYBE SOCIALLY A
LITTLE HARDER BECAUSE IT'S
LONGER.
BUT SURVIVOR IS PHYSICALLY A
TOUGHER GAME.
AND YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY OUT
THERE SHOULD FOLLOW US ON
TWITTER.
 Jeff: KAT, YOU SAID ONE
OF THE FUNNIEST LINES OF THE
SEASON.
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE MERGE
AND YOU SAID IN YOUR TUCKING
IN AT NIGHT, YOU GO WHO IS
GOING TO WANT A DATE A GIRL
WHO DOESN'T MAKE THE MERGE.
WHAT IS THE UPDATE.
ARE YOU GUYS STILL A COUPLE?
 WELL, WE ARE STILL A
COUPLE.
AND WE LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT
STATES SO WE'RE TRYING TO
SEE IF WE CAN GET IN ONE
STATE.
I'VE MADE SOME ARRANGEMENTS
ON MY OWN TO JUST, YOU KNOW,
GET ON HIS LEVEL A LITTLE
BIT.
WHATEVER, SO MAYBE A LITTLE
TOP HEAVY NOW, I GET IT.
 Jeff: WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT.
 I'M A LITTLE TOP HEAVY
NOW.
 Jeff: YOU CHANGED YOUR
BODY.
 I CHANGED A LITTLE BIT OF
A LOOK FOR ME.
 Jeff: TO KEEP HAYDEN
HAPPY.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
 NO.
 Jeff: I'M SO CONFUSED.
 NO, NO.
 IT WORKED OUT THOUGH.
 IT WORKED OUT THAT WAY.
 Jeff: COLTON IS HUGGING
MARISSA, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
IS GOING ON BUT TOUCHE.
 TOUCHE.
 Jeff: OKAY, CANDICE AND
JOHN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW ARE YOU THIS ALL
AMERICAN COUPLE, MILITARY,
ARE YOU BOTH DOCTORS, YOU'RE
ATTRACTIVE, YOU'RE FIT.
EXPLAIN TO ME, CANDACE, WHAT
IS THE ADDED ELEMENT THAT
RELATIONSHIP BRINGS TO THIS.
WHY IS IT SOME OF MORE
DIFFICULT?
 THIS IS THE MOST
DIFFICULT GAME THAT I'VE
EVER PLAYED BECAUSE IN THE
REGULAR SEASON OF SURVIVOR
THAT'S NOT BLOOD VERSUS
WATER YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR
ARMOUR AND YOU CAN THINK
LOGICALLY.
BUT WHEN SOMEONE COMES AFTER
THE PERSON THAT, YOU KNOW,
IS YOUR HEART, YOUR EMOTIONS
GET IN IT AND YOU START, YOU
KNOW, DOING CRAZY THINGS
LIKE-- .
 Jeff: YELLING AT BRAD
CULPEPPER.
 YELLING AT BRAD
CULPEPPER.
 THERE IS NO LOGICAL
THINKING WHEN YOUR WIFE OR
HUSBAND IS INVOLVED.
EVERYTHING JUST COMES AT YOU
SOME OF FASTER THAN YOU
THINK.
THAN I'M SURE IN A NORMAL
GAME OF SURVIVOR.
WHEN SOME RANDOM PERSON
COMES AFTER YOU, YOU LIKE
CANDICE SAID YOU CAN PUT
YOUR ARMOUR UP.
WHEN SOMEONE IS ATTACK THE
PEOPLE YOU LOVE, I'M
WATCHING CANDICE NAME GET
WRITTEN DOWN THAT FIRST DAY
OR, I MEAN T IS JUST-- IT'S
JUST LIKE GET PUNCHED IN THE
FACE EVERY SINGLE TIME I SAW
THAT.
I'M SURE IT IS VERY
DIFFERENT THAN IF IT WASN'T
MY WIFE.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BIT
OF A TURN AND WE'RE GOING TO
VISIT WITH ANOTHER COUPLE
THAT WE HAD OUT HERE,
ANOTHER MOTHER AN DAUGHTER.
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT HOW THOSE SHARED
EXPERIENCE ON THE SHOW, I'M
TALKING ABOUT TINA AND KATIE,
HOW THEIR EXPERIENCE ON THE
SHOW HELPED THEM WITH A
FAMILY TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE SHOW.
IT'S A VERY PERSONAL STORY
WITH A MESSAGE I THINK
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO WANT TO
HEAR.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SURVIVOR LIVE REUNION SHOW,
WE HAD ANOTHER MOTHER
DAUGHTER PAIRING ON THIS
SEASON OF BLOOD
VERSUS-- VERSUS WATER, TINA
AND KATIE.
SO FIRST HOW DID THIS
STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN YOU TWO.
 I THINK LAURA SAID IT
BEST.
WHENEVER THAT BABY IS PLACED
IN YOUR ARMS, IT'S IMMEDIATE
LOVE.
AND ATTRACTION AND
PROTECTIVENESS.
AND YOU CAN'T STRENGTHEN IT,
JEFF.
IN MY OPINION, I DON'T LOVE
HER ANY MORE OR ANY LESS
THAN THE DAY SHE WAS PLACED
IN MY ARMS.
AND THAT IS I THINK WHAT
MOTHERS DO.
SO IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE
AND A GREAT ADVENTURE.
BUT AS FAR AS MAKING US
CLOSER, I DON'T THINK YOU
REQUEST MAKE US ANY CLOSER.
 Jeff: SO YOU HAVE THIS
AMAZINGED HAVE VENTURE
TOGETHER.
YOU COME HOME, AND JUST A
FEW WEEKS AGO YOU SUFFER A
TERRIBLE FAMILY TRAGEDY,
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.
 TWO WEEKS AGO MY SON WAS
IN A FATAL CAR ACCIDENT.
AND THE DRIVER OF THE CAR
WAS WEARING HIS SEAT BELT
AND HE WALKED AWAY.
AND MY SON DID NOT.
AND SO AS A MOTHER OUT THERE,
I JUST PLEAD TO ALL OF YOU,
AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU
WITH CHILDREN T TO PLEASE
BUCKLE UP.
YOU KNOW, A CAR WRECK IS
CALLED AN ACCIDENT FOR A
REASON.
YOU NEVER PLAN FOR THAT TO
HAPPEN.
SO PLEASE BUCKLE UP.
 Jeff: SO TINA,
YOU-- THERE IS SO RECENTLY.
BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS
GROUP OF PEOPLE, AND THE
TRUST YOU HAVE IN THEM THAT
PUTS YOU HERE TONIGHT WHEN
THIS TRAGEDY IS LITERALLY
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD.
WHAT IS THE SAFETY ABOUT.
 YEAH, WELL, ONE THING IS
I'M VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT
I'M A 53-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AND
NOT A 20 SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN.
AND WHENEVER I GO OUT AND
PLAY SURVIVOR I'M NOT JUST
PLAYING THE GAME.
I'M WANTING TO KNOW WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE AND A PART
OF MY WORLD WHENEVER I LEAVE
HERE.
AND IT WAS SUCH AN HONOR AND
A JOY TO PLAY WITH THESE
CHARACTERS.
AND THEY ARE FAMILY, SO CBS
IS A FAMILY TO ME.
THEY'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
AND THEY BRING ME COMFORT.
IT IS COMFORTING TO BE HERE
WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE.
AND SO I WOULDN'T HAVE
MISSED BEING HERE FOR
ANYTHING.
 Jeff: KATIE, HOW ARE YOU
DOING THIS IS YOUR BROTHER,
TAYLOR.
 YEAH, HE WAS SO EXCITED
TO COME TONIGHT.
AND WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GLAD
THAT WE CAME TO THE SHOW
TONIGHT, AND THIS IS SORT OF
THE LIGHT AT THE END OF A
REALLY DARK TUNNEL THAT
WE'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH.
EVERYONE'S JUST BEEN SO
GRACIOUS.
AND ALL THE FANS OF THE SHOW,
OUR FAMILY HERE, YOU GUYS,
WE'VE JUST-- WE'VE SHARED
THIS LOVE AND WE'VE HAD AN
OUTFLOW OF LOVE FROM
EVERYBODY.
AND I WANT TO SAY TO ANY
PROCEEDS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO
SEND, YOU KNOW, FLOWERS OR
JELL-O MOLDS, YOU KNOW, JUST
SORT OF LIKE WHAT PEOPLE DO
WE WANT YOU TO SAY THAT IF
YOU WANT TO DONATE TO GO TO
THE PHILIPPINES DISASTER
RELIEF FUND.
BECAUSE THEY HOSTED US.
 Jeff: AND THAT'S WHERE WE
SHOT THE SHOW.
 YEAH.
 Jeff: ON BEHALF OF
EVERYONE, WE'RE SO SORRY FOR
YOUR LOSS.
AND WE'RE SO GLAD YOU ARE
HERE TO TRY TO FIND SOME
CLOSURE IN THIS EXPERIENCE
AND TIE TAYLOR INTO IT AND
BE A PART OF IT.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN WE COME BACK,
HARD TO TAKE A TURN FROM
THAT TO THIS, BUT THAT'S
KIND OF HOW THIS GOES.
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT
SURVIVOR IS DOING NEXT YEAR,
OR NEXT SEASON IN FEBRUARY.
AND TYSON WILL GET HIS CHECK
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TYSON,
THERE'S YOUR MILLION DOLLAR
CHECK, CONGRATULATIONS.
TOMORROW MORNING YOU CAN SEE
INTERVIEWS WITH TYSON AND
EVERYBODY ON THE AFTER SHOW
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
NEXT SEASON.
TAKE A LOOK.
HERE'S THE PAYOFF.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
 Jeff: BRAUN VERSUS BRAIN
VERSUS BEAUTY, IT IS A GOOD
SEASON.
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE.
YOU CAN BID ON PROPS, GO TO
GOOD NIGHT.
(APPLAUSE)
