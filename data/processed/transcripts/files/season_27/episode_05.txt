I have to say this is the most difficult
my wife and I came here

John is how you think?
least bit of difference makes you and your wife Laoyanfenfei the
she was about to leave and you want a man here
Besides you know how much she want to play

if he did not come back, then I would be very surprised

Today is my most depressed in this day
I did not think Brad would go to Redemption Island
but he'll be fine
reliance
he would come back from Redemption Island
we meet again to the end
okay this is "Survivor"
us the same kind of people
a person can survive another people can
Yes, no matter what happens
Brad and Monica is a very intimate one pair
this very threatening
nothing
Brad I'm good at that...
- if for awhile longer
- ah
- back from Redemption Island
- Yes
matter how we look at the development but to know
This does not affect the relationship between both of us
also hope it will not affect you
I think Monica realized
did not give her lover backing up
she was his efforts to force a
I think our portfolio remains five people
to look after the merger we who still love
is that they come in or go out side are
I can not say hundred percent believe Monica
she either is a big threat
either is a good ally
I have not thought about her that are the types
us well you okay
He's not a silly hat
- he was a lawyer
- yes ah
- to a banana do?
- okay
Ciera last one to you?
unwanted words I ate slightly
to you
thank everybody
"Survivor" game has several layers of meaning
most basic meaning is 
must find something to eat to survive looking for a place to sleep
- to deal with high temperatures
- sand so hot
I did not brush their teeth
most frightening thing is injured
either leg abrasions or what
I covered in insect bites package
never so much over
face neck back are all
we were defeated
I do not know if I can be worse
to now We lost the game
slowly decompose in the body like
our flies too bad
here the circle are inflamed
because the total wear wet shoes
my feet like athlete's foot and ringworm Zhang
Huoshaohuoliao
festering walking painful
on fingernails

Her fingernails and toenails fell fast

but I am very sympathetic to this girl
- are inflamed
- yes ah
We are like licking wounds
because the game in our faith fail frustrated
If I lose down
how regroup
How to get out of the situation failed to reverse
how energized
let yourself unscathed is possible

I think she is like my sister
Now nobody is 100% sure Caleb like doing

Thank you Jeff
Galang game for the first time
you want to participate in tribal council
someone will be eliminated sent Redemption Island
win the battle to fight back in the game
pack things right back to the camp tribal council tonight, see
I keep thinking about that steak
That we have almost no chance
I will be the first to experience tribal council so...
This is my first time meeting these tribal people have experienced a
first tribal council was nervous going to open up
then the tension....
my day could be my
first tribe immediately abandoned me
who knows this tribe is not the same
Nothing I tried to relax
hope everything goes well...
well
I could stay here
I'll still pick up a good
just in case
So today, my strategy is to keep vigilant eye View Quartet
identify who and who gang situation is like
then tour muddy water
let us praise the Lord gave the world delicious Fruit
supply us with carefully taste
your friends complain that you're involved in the game...
bench together when I told them when
they complain I?
Who?
Gals they are just for you a little disappointed...
you suddenly said to match
because they also want to game
girls Bale
woman is always another enemy
I have been born to have felt
- Kat
- feel what?
so what?
girls who want to race
No one wants to sit Bench fact is that
I just casually talk
I know
This is really bad
Laura B My Heart think you spade
I looked left and looked at Tyson he was confused
when you know someone is the lowest level
What you can do something that only echoed their words
- make them feel good about themselves
- Do not worry
she was at the lowest level so she had to say
I'm sorry I said those words
girls ah
we have my Aras Gervase Tina
and Monica a core alliance between the five of us very
iron
Kat think it is the same five people in this league
that I took a good pour
and Laura Morett something totally unaware of the alliance
but now the plan is to throw away all feel super tired of people
- easy - that is, Laura B.
This game is very fun
You know I really enjoyed myself
Well how do you think we What is the consensus?
- I think Laura B is easy
- no one needs to worry too much or panic
- Vote for easy
- easy vote
- Laura B locked
- easy vote locked
Aras is my In the game fully trusted the man
our strategy we need less talk
say the name tell me who
working together and then they act
- Tonight is Laura B
- Laura B
should be 8 votes... 7 votes to 1
- good
- finished
Laura B is very easy to eliminate one vote
so people feel uncomfortable around her
but easy game tickets will always be the most stupid ticket
only because it is easy does not mean we do
do you think the first one who?
Laura B
if we The Laura M banished to Redemption Island
that she might be able to beat Brad will become...
Monica...
is our one card
now if Brad survived Monica leave...
Monica is now her husband at Redemption Island arena
If Brad at the Redemption Island arena lost
not return to the game
She is a great card
she never shelter
Laura M did well in the race she was good at puzzles
if she went to the Redemption Island arena and defeat Brad
then Monica is ours
So Laura M appears to be by far the best choice
we just say...
next is Laura M
What do you think?
- like a The results would then tell us
- well I'll think about it
a variety of things need to think about
Laura Morett's name is being talked about everywhere
Can she defeat the Redemption Island arena Brad?
That is my concern
you think of this idea, okay Monica?
I'm very awkward position
Larua B Brad at Redemption Island will easily beat
Laura M would be a challenge
that...
- Laura B How?
- choose the easy vote
voting will not occur easily argue
Laura M tonight I want to go home
but this is not my personal decision
is the tribe's decision
tribal people know I'm hard to play the game
I Yuxiang vote manipulation
my own situation more dangerous
you behind a torch
take the torch to ignite the flame and put it beside the fire
This is one of the tribal council ceremony
because in this game the flame represents your life 
good first ah
Gervase participation from your last tribal council
for a long time
changed since then Many
me back here pretty crazy in this basin in front of the fire and your
very real to me
I thought I could come by in some way Play
but this has to die was 13 years ago
That is not their
These people will various strategies 
they would be willing to lower the first day of the Covenant
I either have to go home or else join
Tina you are from the second quarter
you as one of the originator's perspective would be like
Jeff I remember that on the fifth day there think
this five days than I have in Australia to play the entire season on the even more
This is so fast
the blood of fight this thing...
If you own a person playing the game
you can run at full speed
but not related to your own
so bloody battle Monica how to change this variable game
costly
every time I go to duel
as now I have to worry about their loved ones
then people began to think who has greater powers after the merger
they may play together with friends
then all of a sudden they will become of duo
This makes the game so pressure doubles
Aras Will they vote out someone
is one of the elements
is a factor in your alliance
then wonder who will talk to friends and relatives in league together
then you have to put this into consideration
But now let Vytas do his something
Perhaps here there will be vacancies may not
but I have to make sure I can keep these relationships
Laura M Aras said, "Hey, my friends are all alone"
This is the only thing you can say things
ah but it's true
like I always have to let go of the day
say "Ciera you have to own a fly
not I am under the wings of the "
sounds cruel
but now it is our blood
Gervase Laura M made a good argument
her to prove that she would abandon her daughter
with her in the game, like
Can this make you feel her tribal loyalty
honest Laura M
days of living together listening to her talk about Ciera
their relationship is iron This is what I love to hear the
but everyone will feel threatened
Friends of the couple mother and brother men
can not have more than these more intimate relationship
Laura B you start the game was soon cast away
you are now living in an old tribal players you've never played
do you belong here
Jeff I feel part of the tribe 
involved in decisions involved in the game
I work is an important tribal officers
and I think they have demonstrated belongs here
course I belong here
Monica you will agree with me
of course, since the first day she was with us
so she is part of the event
and She would fishing fire
tribe certainly so in her position
Laura B which will soon be eliminated, but with people who would say
best tribal members
this will always be the other side
I'm the easy one ticket
I received a warm welcome, but I have to see their disappointment tribe
Rupert's name was talked about it several times
they expect him to play
you can feel... Laura B
Do not you, even if you want to play Rupert
Rupert Taishan forest man
yes I am confident I am the tribe of key personnel
and that have established relationships with these people
I can say these words
but Jeff The other thing is she coming over from the tribal council
So she never tried to extinguish the torch
you say the game has ended the kind of uncomfortable
This will now make us feel uncomfortable
she never had
I could not find a better prelude
yes vote the time
Laura M you come
nice playing with you, but the island is only big enough for a Laura
I'm sorry some people to get back home
but I'm glad Laura the only one tribe
I went to vote
If someone handheld hidden immunity idol and want to use it
Now is the time
good number of votes can not be changed once read the results
be eliminated The person must immediately leave the tribal council
I started reading ticket
first ticket
Laura B
Laura M
Laura M
Laura M Laura B two votes, one vote
Laura M
Laura M three votes
Laura M
Laura M four votes Laura B a ticket
first one eliminated from "Survivor: bloody struggle" is
Laura M
five has enough votes to take the torch over it
Laura tribe decided
you will have the opportunity to return to the game
it took the torch to Redemption Island Good luck
addition to my assassination will not start outside
regression players expect from your other
This indicates that you can never expect what will happen next
go back to the camp packed up the torch Goodnight
do not go away tattered Bear bring you more exciting
survivors under Ep
Aras can be implemented strategy
If we lose the game
you write his name What is the problem not?
Gervase and Tyson ready for self-hill
When Zhanxia Aras Majesty's crown is the key
But not everything would go according to plan
after 14 days we will change some things
exception shocked me was assassinated
Well
- good
- Good
is Laura
How can you lose
I believe in the game should not believe some people
But I'm still in the game the game is not over yet
I have to save their own wisdom
I have to win the duel
