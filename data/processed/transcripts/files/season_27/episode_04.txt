But it would be great to follow in the game.

The silver lining

came to this game to play with Candice. < / i>
the weirdest way to me could have happened
thank Brad
and the rest of my tribe by giving me this opportunity 
to be in this precious
beach with my wife and still be in the game. 
All I have to do is win duels
and return to the game
That's a good one.

Does not anyone realize the sacrifice involved

If anyone sees this, I tell

the first, keeping the fire
and making sure everyone has water.
- It comes naturally be leader.
- Fishing well.
doing all we can to make it easier for

guess that put a white top.
Will there ever be a duel
where my husband
not verbally accused...
by
a lot of people do not even know?
Blaming someone
not even know what it looks like...
is hard to see.
You know,
leaders have followers.
And if that's the case, then someone
are buying what he is selling.
But Brad is the strongest here.
Reaches the merger, I can not believe it.
The only thing I have to say is that you
know Brad
as Brad Culpepper Tampa.
Survivor Brad know.
That's all I'm telling
to open your eyes just a little.
Even if it's just evil,
that's part of the game.
- I'm not angry about it.
- Is clear.
He got rid of Marissa,
did a good job.
're playing the game.
This is how I see it.
guess you do not want to be

Or as said,
"He who gets rid of the people."
But someone has to be. One of
our loved ones in charge.
know it's not mine, so it's
another person.
But my congratulations because you could
maintain your calm as much as you could.
- You could calm down as much as you could.
- Well, thanks for the support.
Appreciate it. And I will not disappoint
being here, that's for sure.
I love that Candice accuses Monica,
to quote: "Brad does what it says."
When Candice was the one that said
giving it to Monica.
"Are you doing what you say your man?"
Today was a difficult day. Candice
not expect that it will take so personal.
"And you, girls
tell them what to do."
Throw it into the fire. Oh, you gonna do what it says
your man?
Everyone assumes that if someone
is expelled from the island 
's because I'm the boss. < / i>
Naturally I run my family.
I have become a leader of this group.
angry if
expel a family and someone gets angry when we do not.
No one is angry with you.
Are angry with me.
Thinking ahead, if we lose the next challenge
Caleb is offline.
I could send a message to the other party 
we are eager to play with
you, and make connections as here.
And I
removes a little pressure on Redemption Island. 
If Caleb ends up going there in
sand, no one will be yelling. 
I have been in the spotlight during
all my life. This is nothing new.
- God.
- Go crazy day, crazy.
has become not Redemption Island,
but speak ill of Brad.
- Yes, it is.
- That's what it is.
Brad is public enemy number one. 
whenever we were in the Redemption Island.
It's weird because I know
treacherously stabbed him John.
totally cheating.
But
feel it is important for us to continue with Brad.
that when we got to the merger, we remove the white
outside us.
If we lose and we have to go to tribal council
will leave one of the girls.
But we must also ensure they do not end up like John.
Totally.
I think I, Hayden and Vytas
are very close. Brad is the last of the group.
How's your arm?
I keep trying to do normal things with him.
- And then I remember...
- What is not a good idea?
- Yes, it hurts.
- Take it easy, man.
'm going to go get some wood.
Tyson, stay lying down.
Yes, I'll stay here.
definitely do not get up to help. I want you to rest.
I hurt my shoulder in the immunity challenge. 
Each day gets a little better, but I like to participate in challenges 
because then I can do less work in the camp. 
Hopefully
that also keep on good terms with me.
- They are far enough away?
- Yes
Then we are on this side.

As the girls cooked, which is the code
as saving our skins.
But today was interesting. 
no-brainer.
Caleb.
I count
you are going to vote for him anyway.
So you are safe.
okay?, Do not you believe me?
I believe because I cheated on before.
I have, and I am now
.
Brad said he would vote for Caleb. 
So I thought Brad might be telling the truth
or not.
I will act like I'm with him. 
I'll believe him 100%, 
but I really do?
Now if we
another challenge and lose...
then... you will have problems.
Ya.
- Bringing...
- Brad!
- Yes?
- Are you coming?
Yes, yes, I'm coming.
I told you no lie.
Now what, man?
I love
Ciera but was useless in the puzzle.
is the second puzzle in which Ciera does not stick. 
Hayden, Vytas and I are agreed
vote Ciera.
that's why we went to speak.
And when Brad
coming soon 
started thinking that is what I was up to
.
For all we went to the well 
and Brad stayed

We charge does little to John so
the same way that boys had a
5 to 4, it could go to 3.

agreement is
Ciera vote today.
- Do you agree?
- Sure.
not trust Brad. 
But if I do in Hayden and
Vytas and I know that support me. 
Ciera So for me okay. 
be the leader here, I have to make some decisions
. 
talked to the girls, and were
agree to vote for Caleb. 
But Ciera no < br /> it for the challenges, 
throw would make the tribe stronger. 
Besides
all that of their loved ones connections
also want to do
the tribe strong.
So I'm not worried
Redemption Island 
and all that entails for me. 
I'm sure if Ciera
appears there 
his mother paid me. 
So I do not,
Ciera is the one go. 
Brad, when you're home and you imagine
play here,
's not how you imagined?
No, I thought so as well.
We lost some strength
challenges, and two puzzle.
Ciera volunteered
in two, and the two he won.
And that were leaving advantage.
Ciera So once again
you confronted your mother
- and again I won.
- Yes
Did you ever think to return to camp
should expel you?
Well, part of me says
that I'm just so good at puzzles
as I thought.
But while
I will not sit and grieve for it.
give up, and I tell
vote.
I'll try
see where and how I can help the rest.
View my options and where I carry.
Brad, in each of the duels
Redemption Island
you took
sticks by all those who left from here .
Yes, and it's not easy when
take your dirty laundry.
exposes you, what you say is not correct
because they do not know what happens
here, just assume that's what happens.
unlike other seasons of Survivor
here have loved ones in the
other side, so that if you ignore
that you are not being smart.
And this is Survivor: Blood vs Water.
So Brad what you mean that would be good
somebody out
who has no one on the other side.
Because none of the other tribe would pay
you.
Yes
's a good point of view,
no doubt about it.
would be easier tomorrow,
not have to go with such a burden.
So do not think
what was the reason why he was expelled.
Caleb, do you feel that pressure?
I feel, may be the
Rancid and want more.
I love the treasons,
but I want to join them?, No.
well be the scapegoat.
When we tell someone
person who you going to vote for who is not.
But that's where it should have ended.
Instead of making me feel
that will be me next.
Clearly
am the last link in the alliance.
No, it is not.
- But this whole campaign rode me.
- There was a campaign against you.
just talking, and
campaign is not appropriate.
was going against you.
Hayden, now you
a serious problem.
