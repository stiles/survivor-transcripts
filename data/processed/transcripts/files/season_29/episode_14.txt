 --- 

        I ACTUALLY LEARNED
ABOUT MYSELF OUT HERE.
THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE TO
NAVIGATE WITHOUT NADIYA--
 LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
 MAKES ME REALLY PROUD.
I'M SMARTER THAN I LOOK
SOMETIMES.
I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF.
I DESERVE THIS MILLION DOLLARS
BUT JUST BECAUSE I DESERVE IT








DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO COME
TO ME ON A SILVER PLATTER.
 Jeff: NATALIE WINS REWARD.
 I CAN'T LEAVE ANYTHING UP TO
FATE.
 Jeff: NATALIE WINS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
 I'M PLAYING THIS FOR JAC.
I NEED EVERYBODY TO SEE WHY I
DESERVE TO BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS THE
REUNION PART OF THE SHOW.
WE HAVE A WINNER, NATALIE.








CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANKS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: A LOT OF SUPPORT.
AND I-- YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I'VE
BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT PROBABLY 15
DAYS IN AND IT WAS ASKED A LOT
ON TWITTER WHEN I WAS SOLICITING
QUESTIONS, E.P. ROACHE SAID IT,
DOES NATALIE THINK YOU DID
BETTER BECAUSE YOUR SISTER WAS
VOTED OUT SO EARLY?
DID THAT GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF
INSPIRATION?
 I THINK MY GAME WAS
DEFINITELY BETTER PLAYING
WITHOUT NADIYA.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS EASIER
FOR ME, BUT I THINK THE PUSH TO
DO SOMETHING FOR NADIYA AND, YOU
KNOW, MAKE HER PROUD AND SAY YOU
KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO VOTE HER
OUT FIRST, I'M LITERALLY GOING
TO BE THE LAST ONE STANDING.
MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD DECISION TO
GET ONE OF US OUT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: THE AUDIENCE REACTION
HERE IN THE STUDIO WHEN YOU
PLAYED THE IDOL FOR JACLYN AND
NOT YOURSELF WAS HUGE.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVES OF THE
GAME.
BUT THAT IS A GIANT RISK TO GIVE
UP AN IDOL TO MAKE THIS ONE BIG
POWER MOVE.
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT
MOMENT?
 I REMEMBER WALKING INTO
TRIBAL AND KNOWING I HAD THIS
DECISION, BUT I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU SAID IF ANYBODY'S GOT AN
IDOL, PLAY IT NOW, I BLACKED
OUT.
AND I JUST-- I LITERALLY DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.
I DON'T REMEMBER EVEN ASKING
JACLYN, "DID YOU VOTE FOR WHO I
TOLD YOU TO VOTE FOR?"
I JUST REMEMBER GOING AND
SAYING, "I GOTTA DO THIS."
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW BAYLOR
WAS GETTING VOTED OUT.
I LITERALLY BLACKED OUT WHEN I
DID THAT.
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING.
 Jeff: SO DESPITE HOW BIG A
MOVE THAT WAS, MY OPINION, THE
BIGGEST MOVE OF THE GAME WAS
CONVINCING JACLYN TO GET RID OF
KEITH AND NOT YOU.
IS THAT-- DO YOU AGREE WITH
THAT?
 I MEAN, I WOULDN'T-- I
WOULDN'T HAVE SAT IN THAT FINAL
THREE NILS CONVINCED JACLYN THAT
KEITH WAS THE BIGGER THREAT.
AND I THINK HAVING MISSY AND
KEITH CANW ME IN THE FINAL FOUR
ALLOWED ME TO TARGETUE KNOW, PUT
THE TARGET ON THEMSELVES, TELL
KEITH IT WAS MISSY, TELL MISSY
IT WAS KEITH, AND THE TARGET IS
OFF ME.
 Jeff: JACLYN, YOU'RE NOT
PRIVY TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE
SAYING AND DOING.
 RIGHT.
 Jeff: WHEN YOU'RE NOW AT
HOME WATCHING THIS AND YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING, DO YOU REGRET
THAT MOVE?
 MAN, SHE PLAYED ME.
AND DURING THE GAME I HAD NO
IDEA SHE HAD AN IDOL FOR ONE.
AND FOR TWO, I MEAN, I LITERALLY
THOUGHT KEITH WOULD HAVE ALL THE
JURY VOTES.
I CAME FROM COYOPA, WHERE HE WAS
STRONG WITH ALL THE GUYS.
I WAS LIKE HE IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT IF I AM IN THE FINAL
THREE WITH HIM.
DO IT.
IF I HAD KNOWN DIFFERENT I WOULD
HAVE VOTED NATALIE, BUT I HAD NO
IDEA.
 Jeff: LET'S SAY YOU VOTE
DIFFERENTLY.
I LOVE DOING THIS GAME.
SO NATALIE IS NOW IN THE JURY
AND KEITH, YOU'RE NOT IN THE
JURY.
SO JUST SHOW OF HANDS FOR THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW ON THE JURY,
INCLUDING YOU, NATALIE, SO IT'S
KEITH, MISSY, AND JACLYN IN THE
FINAL, HOW MANY VOTES DOES KEITH
GET?
SO THAT'S FOUR.
THAT'S-- JOSH-- HOW MANY DOES
JACLYN GET?
ONE.
HOW MANY DOES MISSY GET?
WE'RE MISSING'S VOTE.
SO FOUR.
SO KEITH, YOU WIN IT.
THAT WASN'T NEARLY AS DRAMATIC--
( APPLAUSE )
AS I HAD HOPED.
SO, KEITH, THAT CLOSE.
 THAT CLOSE.
 Jeff: THAT CLOSE.
ONE CONVERSATION THAT YOU SWAY
JACLYN.
AFTER ALL THAT YOU FIGHT OUT
THERE FOR, EVEN NOW YOU DO SEEM
A LITTLE TEARY.
 MAN, IT GETS TO ME.
I TOLD SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S FOURTH OR 18th, I
TONIGHT KNOW WHAT-- ANYWHERE IN
BETWEEN.
I JUST, YOU KNOW, OVER THE HUMP,
GET OVER THE HUMP.
 Jeff: SO MEANING IF YOU
DON'T GET TO THE END, IT DOESN'T
MATTER?
 YEAH, I COULDN'T-- YEAH.
I LOVED PLAYING.
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE, LIKE
AT NUMBER 10, YOU SAY I'VE DONE
PRETTY GOOD.
I'M 50-SOMETHING YEARS OLD.
IF THEY VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT I'M
GOOD WITH IT.
BUT THEY DON'T AND YOU SAY,
YEAH!
ANOTHER WEEK.
AND YOU SAY NINE, AND THE SAME
THING, AND WHEN IT GETS TO FOUR
YOU'RE REALLY SAYING HEY, I'M IN
THIS-- YOU KNOW.
 Jeff: I LOVE HOW OPEN ARE
YOU WITH YOUR EMOTIONS.
YOU CRY AS MUCHAISE DO.
KEITH IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
A SUPER FAN.
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT.
BUT IT WAS REALLY CLEAR ONE
NIGHT AT TRIBAL WHEN HE TOLD
EVERYONE IN HIS ALLIANCE IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, "STICK
TO THE PLAN."
 I SAY STICK TO THE PLAN.
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, THAT'S
ALL I CAN SAY.
 Jeff: WOW, JON, STICK TO
THE PLAN.
( LAUGHTER )
 IT'S ALL RIGHT!
( APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: DID YOUR BUDDIES AT
THE FIREHOUSE--
 OH, YEAH.
 Jeff: GIVE YOU A LITTLE
GRIEF?
 EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING,
COME ON, LET'S GO OUT AND MOW
THE YARD.
LISTEN, STICK TO THE PLAN!
 Jeff: JEREMY, FROM A GAME
POINT VIEW, BECAUSE YOU AND
JOSH, ESPECIALLY, REALLY FANS OF
THIS GAME, AND EARLY ON WERE
KIND OF DUKING IT OUT TOGETHER,
WHAT DOES PLAYING WITH KEITH DO
BECAUSE IN A WAY, IT'S A NEW
TWIST TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY?
 I MEAN, KEITH'S A GOOD DUDE,
YOU KNOW, BUT KEITH IS NOT BUILT
FOR "SURVIVOR."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THIS GAME IS-- WE-- JOSH AND I,
WE GO BACK AND FORTH ALL THE
TIME, AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE
ANOTHER STRATEGIST OUT THERE,
BUT WITH KEITH YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
 Jeff: AND THAT MAKES IT
HARD TO DO WHAT?
 IT MAKES IT HARD TO PLAY THE
GAME.
IT MIGHT EVEN BE HARDER TO PLAY
THE GAME WITH PEOPLE-- A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT REPORT REAL
STRATEGISTS AS OPPOSED TO
PLAYING THE GAME WITH A WHOLE
BUNCH --
 BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ANTICIPATE.
 YOU CAN'T ANTICIPATE
ANYTHING.
 Jeff: NATALIE, QUESTION
FROM FORCE OF FILL, A TWITTER
QUESTION THEY WONDERED WHEN WE
WERE OUT THERE.
AND YOU ROCKER GOT INTO IT AT
THIS CHALLENGE.
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT START.
AND HE ASKS, "WHY DID NATALIE
EXPLODE AT ROCKER?"
WAS THAT A STRATEGIC MOVE FROM
YOU TO PICK A FIGHT?
 IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT
STRATEGIC.
I LOST IT BECAUSE I WAS TAKING
OUT ALL THE ANGER I HAD ABOUT
NADIYA GETTING VOTED OFF, AND
JOHN WAS THE PERFECT TARGET FOR
ME, AND HE JUST SAID SOMETHING.
 AND JUST WENT OFF ON HIM.
NOT STRATEGIC.
NOT MY BEST MOMENT.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
ROCKER DIDN'T REALLY INITIATE
THAT FIGHT?
 ROCKER SAID SOMETHING NOT--
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NADIYA,
BUT NOTHING, LIKE, BAD TO ME,
AND I JUST LOST IT.
I BLACKED OUT, AND I JUST WENT--
 A LOT OF BLACKOUTS.
 Jeff: THE BLACKING OUT IS A
THEME.
 Jeff: SO, JOHN, WHAT'S THAT
LIKE?
THIS IS PART OF YOUR LEGACY,
BEGINNING AN ARGUMENT.
 A COUPLE.
 Jeff: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO SEE
THAT PLAY BACK?
DID YOU FEEL LIKE SHE WAS
PICKING A FIGHT?
CAN DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING?
 NO, I HONESTLY ANTICIPATED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT COMING DOWN
THE PIKE AT SOME POINT, HOWEVER
LONG I LASTED OUT THERE.
AND IT WAS SO FUNNY WHEN I WAS
OUT HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS
ACTUALLY WATCH AGO, OF COURSE,
MY EXIT EPISODE.
I WAS ON WITH CRISTY AND HIS
FAMILY ON A SKYPE CALL, THESE
TWO YAHOOS, AND I'M WATCHING HER
YELL AT ME OVER SKYPE, NAT, SEE
HOW YOU TREAT ME THAT WAY.
IT'S FUNNY HINDSIGHT.
WE'VE ALL BECOME FRIENDS NOW AND
IT'S KIND OF A RUNNING JOKE.
 Jeff: I GOTTA SAY, THE
REASON I ASK, IS EVEN IN THE
BEGINNING, YOU INITIALLY TRIED
TO BOND WITH JEREMY AND JOSH.
BLACK GUY, GAY GUY.
YOU EVEN TRIED TO HELP JEREMY'S
WIFE, BUT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
INTERESTING, YOU ARE CLEARLY
OUTSPOKEN AND YOU GET YOURSELF
INTO YOUR OWN TROUBLE BUT YOU
SEEMED TO HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS
WHEN THE GAME STARTED AND
THERE'S A QUESTION FROM WAD1980,
WHO SAYS LOOKING BACK ON THE IT,
WHAT IS MORE DIFFICULT IN YOUR
LIFE, FACING BARRY BONDS OR
PLAYING THIS GAME?
 I KNOW HOW TO FACE BARRY.
BARRY-- BARRY'S GOT-- IT'S A
VERY DIFFICULT GAME PLAN TO FACE
BARRY, BUT I KNOW HOW TO FACE
BARRY.
I CAN WATCH FILMS.
I CAN STUDY THINGS LIKE THAT.
JUST LIKE JEREMY WAS SAYING, THE
STRATEGY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO
PREDICT, NOT BEING ABLE TO--
SOME PEOPLE ARE WILD CARDS AND
SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN READ AND
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT THE WILD
CARDS WHEN YOU CAN EASILY GO UP
AGAINST BARRY BONDS AND PUT
TOGETHER A GAME PLAN BECAUSE YOU
KNOW BARRY.
IT'S EASIER TO THAN FIGURING OUT
SOMEONE'S TENDENCIES YOU HAVE
KNOWN TWO DAYS.
 Jeff: UP NEXT, JOSH AND
REED, TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR
PLAYERS THIS SEASON-- JUSTAG SC
MY MOM-- THEY ARE CHANGE LIVES
OUTSIDE OF "SURVIVOR."
PLUS JON AND JACLYN WHAT, A
FIGHT.
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THEIR
RELATIONSHIP?
AND LATER, WE GOING TO SHOW YOU
WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT SEASON.
I REALLY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
LIKE IT.
"SURVIVOR: SAN JUAN DEL SUR"
REUNION SHOW.
WE ARE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
COULD TRADE BEANS FOR OUR FLINT
JIEFERS WONDERING IF THERE WAS
SOME TRADE WE COULD DO, MAYBE
HALF THE FISHING GEAR.
 DO YOU HAVE THE FLINT IN YOUR
HAIR.
 Jeff: THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A TRIBE THAT HAS NEEDED AS MUCH
HELP AS YOU GUYS HAVE.
 I WANT TO GIVE MINE FOR JACK.
 I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS UP
FOR MISSY.
HAVE FUN.
 Jeff: I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
HAD THIS MANY GIVE-UP REWARDS IN
ALL THE OTHER SEASONS COMBINED.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IT WAS THE SEASON OF GIVING.
WELCOME BACK, LIVE REUNION SHOW.
"SURVIVOR: SAN JUAN DEL SUR."
SO, JOSH, YOU AND REED, A GAY
CHRISTIAN COUPLE.
IT'S A LOT.
AND THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS WERE
SO OPEN WITH YOUR AFFECTION AND
YOUR HIGHS AND YOUR LOWS, WHAT'S
BEEN THE REACTION FROM PEOPLE
WATCHING YOU GUYS?
 YEAH, IT'S BEEN AMAZING,
ACTUALLY.
I WOULD SAY WE'VE BEEN GETTING
ABOUT 98% POSITIVE REACTION AND
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN OVERWHELMING
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO CONTACT
US AND SAY, "THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR US."
EVEN WE'VE HAD PEOPLE IN, LIKE,
THE MIDWEST, YOUNG TEENAGERS
BEING LIKE, "HEY, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE WERE
OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME,
LIKE THIS, WHO ARE GAY AND
CHRISTIAN."
WE NEVER SET OUT TO BE PIONEERS
BUT IT ENDED UP HAPPENING SO
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
 Jeff: THANK YOU, REED.
SO YOU'RE HEARING FROM
INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE, CONTACTING
YOU AND TELLING YOU THEIR STORY?
 ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.
IT'S BEEN-- IT'S HUMBLING
BECAUSE, LIKE, I GOT A MESSAGE
FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAID, "YOU
KNOW WHAT, I'VE GROWN UP IN THE
BIBLE BELT AND I'VE KIND OF BEEN
OSTRACIZED FROM MY CHURCH AND I
DON'T REALLY SPEAK FROM MY
FAMILY, BUT AFTER MY DAD HAS
BEEN WATCHING 'SURVIVOR' HE
REACHED OUT TO ME AND NOW WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT STUFF.
MY DAD SAW YOU AND JOSH ON THE
SHOW AND DIDN'T REALIZE THERE
REALLY WERE GAY CHRISTIANS AND
PEOPLE COULD BE FOLLOWING JESUS
AND BE GAY AT THE SAME TIME."
THAT WAS KIND OF OUR THING.
WE JUSTMENTED TO BE TRUE TO
OURSELVESES AND KIND OF WHO WE
ARE, SO IT'S HUMANBLING.
IT REALLY IS.
 Jeff: I WANT TO SHOW
SOMEBODY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I MET SOMEBODY EARLIER WHO MADE
A COMMENT THAT I WANTED TO
SHARE.
I HAD CHARLENE.
 HI!
 Jeff: YOU SAID SOMETHING I
THOUGHT WAS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT
WATCHING JOSH AND REED.
 YEAH, AS A CHRISTIAN, I THINK
THAT THEY REPRESENTED OUR FAITH
BEAUTIFULLY.
AND THAT LOVE IS LOVE AT THE END
OF THE DAY.
THEY REALLY SHOWCASED THAT.
 Jeff: GOOD, THANKS.
 NO PROBLEM.
 Jeff: AND BY THE WAY, JUST
A PERSONAL NOTE FROM ME TO
"PLEASE DON'T GO IN THE
AUDIENCE."
SORRY, CONNOR.
THERE WAS ANOTHER DUOTHAT HAD A
LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING THIS
SEASON.
IT WAS THE POWER COUPLE, JON AND
JACLYN.
THEY WERE SWING VOTES AT MANY
TRIBAL COUNCILS, BUT IT WAS THAT
VERY PUBLIC AND DELICIOUS
ARGUMENT THAT HAD OTHER COUPLES
ARGUING OVER WHO STARTED IT.
 I ALREADY KNEW ALL THIS.
 OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I WON'T TELL YOU ANYMORE.
 HEY!
 NO.
 JACLYN, STOP!
 BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU,ERVA
GOING TO ATTACK YOU IN, LIKE, 10
MINUTES.
 I'M GLAD YOU DID, OKAY.
 NEXT TIME I WON'T.
 OKAY, HEY, HEY.
 DON'T TOUCH ME.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
 SCREW HIM!
 Jeff: SO, JON, FIRST
QUESTION IS.
 YES.

 Jeff: ARE YOU STILL
TOGETHER?
 OH, JACLYN AND I NEVER GOT
OVER-- WE'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGED.
WE GOT ENGAGED.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: WELL, YOU KNOW, I
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE
THIS, THIS COMMENT.
THE THING I HEARD MOST ABOUT
THAT WAS EVERY GUY SAID, "THAT
IS EVERY ARGUMENT I'VE EVER HAD
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.
IT'S OVER NOTHING.
IT BLOWS UP INTO SOMETHING BIG,
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
WHAT STARTED IT."
SO WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING IT AT
HOME, BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT
EXPERIENCE TO HAVE IT, WHAT WAS
THAT LIKE FOR YOU?
 IT WAS ACTUALLY HILARIOUS,
BECAUSE, I MEAN, NOW WE'RE
SITTING IN THE SAME SEAT AS
EVERYBODY ELSE WATCHING IT, AND
WE'RE REALIZING, HOW, WE MUST
HAVE BEEN STARVED OR SOMETHING
AND UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE,
MAYBE, OR SOMETHING.
BECAUSE WE DON'T GET IN
ARGUMENTS OVER LITTLE TINY
THINGS LIKE THAT.
 Jeff: "SURVIVOR" WILL DO
THAT TO YOU.
EATING THE ONE CUP OF RICE A
DAY, EXCEPT FOR THE HUNAHPU
TRIBE.
 OH!
 Jeff: JACLYN, WHAT'S THAT
LIKE FOR YOU TO WATCH IT BACK
BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN.
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO
HAVE AN ARGUMENT.
 IN THAT MOMENT IN MY HEAD, I
THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL,
BUT THEN WATCHING IT BACK, I'M
LIKE OH, MY GOSH.
WE FOUGHT OVER THAT.
I DIDN'T TALK TOW HIM FOR FIVE
HOURS AFTER THAT.
I'M KIND OF LUCKIY WE DON'T HAVE
A CAMERA IN OUR HOUSE EVERY DAY
WHEN WE ARGUE, SO, YEAH.
 Jeff: YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT
IMPRESSIONS.
YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY WELL ENOUGH
AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT THAT
DIDN'T CAUSE ANY DAMAGE?
 ACTUALLY, SINCE WE'VE GOT
ENGAGED, THERE'S A BIG PARENT OF
HIS FAMILY I HAVEN'T MET YET.
THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION OF ME IS
ON "SURVIVOR."
AND I'M LIKE, OH, GREAT, WE'RE
ARGUING OVER THE DUCKEST THING,
"HEY, THIS IS MY FIANCE."
IT'S KIND OF LIKE, THIS IS US.
 Jeff: NO, JON, TAKE IT BACK
TO THE GAME, BECAUSE WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IS REED IS GOING, "OH,
MY GOD, THEY'RE ARGUING RIGHT
NOW."
NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON IT,
DID IT HAVE AN IMPACT HAD YOU
BEEN TALKING MIGHT YOU HAVE
VOTED ANOTHER WAY?
 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT A
LOT.
YOU NEVER KNOW-- IT'S HARD TO
SAY IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
HOW WOULD IT HAVE TURNED OUT?
I WANTED TO TALK TO JACLYN ABOUT
IT.
I THINK BOTH OF US WANTED TO
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THAT, BUT --
 DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED-- AND NATALIE GOES
HOME--
 IT VERY WELL COULD HAVE.
IT VERY WELL COULD HAVE.
IN THAT SITUATION, I THINK
NATALIE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE
--
 WHEN YOU WERE WINKING YOU
WERE BEING SINCERE JIEFS BEING
VERY SINCERE.
I WANTED TO TALK TO HIM LATER.
AND EVERY TIME HE CAME UP, I
SAID I HAVEN'T TALKED TO JACLYN
YET.
 Jeff: REED, IT IS AMAIDSING
IN THIS GAME THAT LAST FORWARD
3924-HOUR DAYS, THAT IT CAN BE
ONE MOMENT THAT SHIFTS YOUR
SHOT.
 OH, ABSOLUTELY.
WHETHER IT'S STICK TO THE PLAN
OR WHETHER IT'S THE LOVER'S
QUARREL, THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS HAPPENING?
NOTHING CAN HAPPEN RIGHT NOW FOR
ME."
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT
HAPPENED.
I THINK YOU SAW MY FRUSTRATION
FINALLY BY THE END, "JACLYN,
GIRL, I GET IT THAT YOU GUYS ARE
RHAVING A PROBLEM BUT YOU'RE
KILLING ME RIGHT NOW."
IT'S HYSTERICAL TO WATCH NOW,
BUT IT WAS MURDER GOING THROUGH.
 Jeff:
 Jeff: WHAT DOES "SURVIVOR"
HAVE IN STORE FOR NEXT SEASON?
IT'S GOOD AND THAT'S STILL TO
COME.
BUT UP NEXT, IT WAS ONE OF THE
MOST BRUTAL TONGUE LASHINGS OF
ANY FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL, REED
CALLING MISSY THE WICKED
STEP-MOTHER.
HOW DO YOU LIKE HIM NOW, MOM?
WHERE DOES THEIR RELATIONSHIP
STAND?
WE'LL FIND OUT AS THE "SURVIVOR:
SAN JUAN DEL SUR" REUNION SHOW
CONTINUES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: BACK BACK TO THE LIVE
REUNION SHOW OF "SURVIVOR: SAN
JUAN DEL SUR."
SO, MISSY, YOU-- YOU'RE
INTRODUCED IN THIS SHOW WITH A
LINE THAT SAYS SOMETHING SIMILAR
TO, "MARRIED AND DIVORCED THREE
TIMES."
THAT'S YOUR INTRODUCTION.
I ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK YOU, WHAT
IS THAT LIKE TO HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION?
DO YOU FEEL IT IS A BURDEN?
DID IT HELP YOU RELEASE IT?
OR DID IT BURY YOU?
 I FEEL LIKE THAT IT TOTALLY
FREED ME.
I HAD CARRIED SO MUCH SHAME
ABOUT THAT NUMBER THREE.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES.
I'VE BEEN DIVORCED THREE TIMES.
AND THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR INTRO
OF ME, IT WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
EVERYBODY IN THE NATION KNOWS
I'VE BEEN DIVORCED THREE TIMES."
I TOLD MY MOM ACTUAL LET'S AT
ONE POINT, I SAID, "I HAD KNOWN
WE WERE GOING TO GO ON TO
'SURVIVOR' WE COULD HAVE SAVED A
WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN THERAPY
BECAUSE IT COMPLETELY FREED ME.
I SHOULD NO SHAME.
NONE.
 Jeff:
 Jeff: GREAT, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE IT.
THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT IS
I'M A HOPELESS ROMANTIC AND I
WILL TRY AGAIN.
 YES, I WILL TRY AGAIN.
 Jeff: BAYLOR, WHAT WAS IT
LIKE FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WAS A
REALLY UNIQUE SITUATION TO WATCH
SUCH A YOUNG WOMAN PLAY A GAME
THAT IT CAN BE DEVASTATING AND
TO PLAY IT WITH HIR MOM AND THEN
TO SEE HER MOM GET INJURED.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GUYS'
RELATIONSHIP AS A RESULT OF THE
SHOW?
 I GUESS OUR RELATIONSHIP
REALLY-- IT DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH
UNTIL THE VERY END, I FEEL LIKE.
BUT THROUGHOUT, IT REALLY WAS
LIKE MIRRORING OUR RELATIONSHIP
BACK HOME.
I MEAN, I GET HURT, SHE PICKS ME
UP.
SHE GET HURT, I PICK HER UP.
 Jeff: ARE YOU TIGHTER AS A
RESULT, OR IS THIS KIND OF MORE
OF THE SAME?
 WE'RE ALWAYS TIGHTER AFTER
THESE SITUATIONS, BUT IT IS THE
SAME, I FEEL LIKE.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST ANOTHER
SURVIVING MOMENT.
 Jeff: SO, MISSY, YOU HAVE
TALKED TO REED ABOUT WHAT WENT
DOWN?
BECAUSE I GOTTA SAY, BEING
THERE, THIS WAS-- IT WAS VERY
EMOTIONAL.
IT WAS EMOTIONAL FOR BAYLOR.
YOU GOT VERY UPSET.
AND, YOU KNOW, REED'S PLAYED THE
GAME.
HE'S NOT IN IT ANYMORE.
HE WANTS TO GET HIS LAST LICKS
IN.
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU
GUYS?
 HEY, GIRL.
( LAUGHTER )
 Jeff: IS THAT-- IS THAT
REALLY IT?
THERE ISN'T ONE?
 YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE IS A
HUGE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
I WILL SAY THIS, I'M VERY
POSITIVE AND ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO CAN SAY, "IT'S OKAY.
SLAP ME AGAIN, I'M GOOD, LET'S
JUST MOVE "O."
THIS ONE, WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW,
IS I HAVE BEEN A STEPMOM, AND
THAT MOMENT WAS LIKE-- I THINK
IF HE HAD KNOWN A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ME, HE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THOSE LASHES
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE THE BIGGEST
STAB TO MY BACK.
I WASN'T READY FOR IT.
 Jeff: REED, I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU A LITTLE EARLY DEFENSE
BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW
FOR SO LONG, AND IT IS
EXHAUSTING.
AND PEOPLE ON THE JURY ARE
USUALLY VERY FRUSTRATED.
AND THEY WANT TO GET IT IN.
BUT IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION,
GIVEN WHAT A GREAT-- PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING AT YOU FOR A ROLE MODEL.
WE HAVE CHARLENE IN THE AUDIENCE
SAYING LOVE IS LOVE.
IS THAT HARD FOR YOU TO WATCH
WHAT YOU SAID?
 YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, AND I MADE
IT VERY CLEAR FOR ME THAT I
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MISSY'S
CHARACTER IN THE GAME, NOT
MISSY'S CHARACTER IN LIFE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE
THINGS TO ME.
I THINK MISSY'S-- SHE SEEMS LIKE
A WONDERFUL PERSON OUTSIDE OF
THIS GAME.
WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT
WAS HAPPENING, IT WAS ALL WITHIN
THE CONTEXT OF THE GAME.
SO IT WASN'T THIS IS MISSY.
THIS IS THE CHARACTER I SAW
MISSY AS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF
"SURVIVOR."
 Jeff: DO YOU FEEL A NEED TO
APOLOGIZE OR DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE
GOOD?
 I FEEL LIKE I STAND BY WHAT I
SAID FOR WITHIN THE GAME.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS
GAME.
( APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: OKAY, EVERY SEASON,
AND OH, I LOVE THAT WE GET TO DO
ANOTHER SEASON.
WE TRY TO FIND NEW WAYS TO
CHANGE THE SHOW SO THAT WE CAN
GIVE YOU THE SAME THING ONLY
DIFFERENT.
AND WE'RE DOING THAT AGAIN FOR
NEXT SEASON AND WHEN WE COME
BACK, I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT
IT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
 Jeff: "SURVIVOR" REUNION
WILL CONTINUE, ONLY CBS.
 Jeff: AS ONE SEASON COMES
TO A CLOSE ANOTHER SEASON IS
GETTING READY TO BIRTH ITSELF
INTO THE "SURVIVOR" WORLD.
HERE IS WHAT WE ARE DOING NEXT
SEASON.
FOR 29 SEASONS, "SURVIVOR" HAS
TRAVEL DPLOAB, STUDYING HUMAN
BEHAVIOR.
BASED ON AGE, SEX, I.Q., LOOKS,
STRENGTH, AND EVEN FAMILY.
 I LOVE YOU.
 Jeff: AND FOR OUR 30th
BLOOD VS. "SURVIVOR" IS EVOLVING
ONCE AGAIN.
 I'VE WORKED IN CORPORATE
AMERICA MY WHOLE LIFE.
 I'M THE KIND OF GUY WHO LIKES
TO BE IN CONTROL.
 WE'RE THE MONEY MAKERS.
I STEP ON THE PEOPLE TO GET TO
THE NEXT PLATEAU.
 WHAT BLUE COLLAR STANDS FOR
IS HARDWORKING AMERICAN.
 16 HOURS A DAY OUTSIDE IN THE
DIRT.
 BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS,
CALLOUSES ON OUR HANDS, SORE AT
THE END OF THE KAY.
 I'M A FREE SPIRIT.
I COULD NEVER LIVE IN A CUBICLE.
 I DO WHAT I WANT TO DO WHEN I
FEEL LIKE DOING IT.
 I LIVE MY LIFE NOT BY ANYBODY
ELSE'S RULES.
 IT'S SURVIVOR WARFARE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
 Jeff: I WANT TO SEE HOW
THIS RESONATES.
GLENN, LET'S GET A BIG SHOT.
DON'T BE SHY.
WHO HERE ASSOCIATES WITH WHITE
COLLAR?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT, GUY RIGHT HERE, FRONT
ROW, COME DOWN.
YEAH, COME ON DOWN.
COME OHUSTLE UP LIKE IT'S A
CHALLENGE.
YOU GOTTA PICK IT UP!
ROB, GIVE HIM A MIC.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 MY NAME IS JOHN.
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR, WHY?
WHAT DO YOU DO?
 I'M AN ATTORNEY.
 Jeff: YOU DON'T HESITATE,
RIGHT?
 I'VE BEEN AN ATTORNEY FOR 23
YEARS.
 Jeff: WHITE COLLAR.
YOU GUYS MAKE THE RULES.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE PEOPLE THAT
WORK FOR YOU.
 YES.
 Jeff: OKAY.
SO YOU'RE USED TO BEING IN
CHARGE?
 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, YES.
JUDGES A LITTLE BIT MORE, BUT I
HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT
BLUE COLLAR.
WHO FEELS THEY'RE BLUE COLLAR.
COME DOWN HERE.
ROB YOU HAVE ANOTHER MIC?
THERE WE GO.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 MY NAME IS FRED.
 Jeff: BLUE COLLAR, WHAT DO
YOU DO?
 I'M A GENERAL CONTRACTOR.
 Jeff: SO YOU'RE
CONSTRUCTION?
 YES.
 Jeff: AND ARE YOU OUT THERE
WORKING?
 EVERY DAY IN THE TREMPS, SIDE
BY SIDE, MAKING SURE THE JOB
GETS DONE RIGHT.
 Jeff: WHEN YOU SAY BLUE
COLLAR, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DO AND I
LOVE MY JOB.
 Jeff: NOW, THE NO-COLRARS
THE SEEM WHO SAY I DON'T SO MUCH
WANT A BUILDING.
NOT SURE I'LL GET MY HANDS DIRTY
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO NEXT BECAUSE I'M A
FREE SPIRIT.
WHO HERE FEELS I AM A NO-COLLAR?
ALL RIGHT, RIGHT HERE.
YOU LOOK THE PART RIGHT AWAY.
 THERE YOU GO.
 Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 CASE EXPWHRE.
 Jeff: AND THAT IS PART OF
IT, RIGHT, FEELING FREE?
YOU'RE TATTOOING YOUR BODY.
 YEAH, DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO, FREE SPIRIT.
 Jeff: DID YOU RELATE TO
THAT?
IS THAT REALLY A STATE OF MIND
OF--
 I THINK SO, YEAH, LIVING LIFE
AS STRESS-FREE AS POSSIBLE.
IT'S KIND OF GREAT.
 Jeff: SO WHOSE PHILOSOPHY
IS THE BEST ONE, WHITE COLLAR,
BLUE COLLAR OR NO COLLAR?
 MY COLLAR.
 I'D SAY NO COLLAR.
 I THINK A LOT OF US PROBABLY
WONDER WHAT THE OTHER COLLAR
WOULD BE LIKE A LITTLE BIT.
 Jeff: WELL, THIS IS WHAT IT
IS.
THIS IS IT TO ME.
WE DO THIS SEASON.
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.
THIS REALLY IS AMERICA, AND IT'S
WHITE COLLAR VERSUS BLUE COLLAR
VERSUS NOICALLER.
IT'S FEBRUARY 25.
IT'S A 90-MINUTE PREMIERE,
FOLLOWED BY THE PREMIERE "THE
