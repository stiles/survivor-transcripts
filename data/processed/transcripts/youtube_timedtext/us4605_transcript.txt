I'll be honest.
I do have the skull card. TEVIN:
 He literally folded his cards. And now Maria and myself
 both have extra votes. (laughs) PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... Come on. It's a real true idol... Yes!
Survivor bucket list item achieved. JEM:
 Nobody knows that I found
 the Beware Advantage first... ...and that I actually
 have replanted the note. Aah! This does not rock. Done. I lost my vote. Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me. Help me. If this is what You wanted, You shouldn't have put me
on Survivor in the first place. -Help me, Tiff, please.
-No. Wow. What a plan, man. BHANU:
 I am going home tonight, but it's not
 about the million dollars. All I want to do
 is win a million hearts. KENZIE:
You won my heart, Bhanu. -Mine, too.
-All of our hearts.
-Seriously. All right, Bhanu,
when you're ready. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ -KENZIE: The tiniest tribe
there ever was.
-I know. KENZIE:
That was an interesting Tribal. KENZIE: Yeah. I'm happy
he told us his story, though. He's a sweetheart
and an amazing person, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're, like,
the best Survivor player. -Absolutely.
-And that's the... that's the, -like, hard reality.
-Yeah. TIFFANY: It was a unanimous decision that
Bhanu would go home. We all knew that we weren't gonna be able
 to play the game we wanted to and teach Bhanu how to play the game
at the same time. We did make a pact
on day one, and -we're still here together.
-I'm still riding with you. So, we did something right. I'm happy
with the three that are left. Kenzie and Q are my two
 closest allies in the game. At this point,
 we just got to win one immunity challenge, but something tells me that's not
how it's gonna go down. We are the worst tribe
in Survivor history. LOL. Um... We're going into day ten
 without fire, which I think is a record. It's definitely affecting all
 of us in a multitude of ways. My stomach is actually
starting to eat itself. KENZIE:
 This tribe needs to win, get some food and just have fun. Sorry.
I'm just, like, so tired. Because we, like,
 keep losing everything. We don't have fire. We don't... We can't do anything. It's frustrating. Ugh. It's just tough. Tough, tough, tough. (sniffles) (sighs) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Ooh. It's crazy being in, like,
a hellhole in, like, the most
beautiful place on Earth. I remember I read
the Mötley Crüe autobiography, The Dirt, when I was in, like,
middle school, and Tommy Lee talked about coming to Fiji
and living in, like, a bungalow. I'm like... (sighs)
This ain't that. You know, I've been getting
 more depleted every day 'cause the shelter of pain
is not a condo or a luxury hotel room. But, uh, anytime you suffer is another opportunity to learn
the depths of your mind. Ooh! Ooh. -You okay, Ben?
-Major, like, spins. CHARLIE:
Do you need a water refill? BEN:
Yeah, if you could.
Thank you, buddy. I'm really thankful for Charlie, and he's looking out for me,
 but, like, you know, I have had
some survival experiences. You ever been stuck in a van
with the same six people for two months surviving off
three dollars at Taco Bell a day? It is not easy. Sir Ben. BEN:
Sir Charles, lead the way. Onward. We go to war. MORIAH:
Feel like Ben's been making an extra effort to hang around
only Charlie recently. He has. I've seen that. MARIA: I think
they're trying to make... MARIA:
The thing is that they did not -calculate that
we got to him first.
-JEM: Yeah. MORIAH:
But, I mean, this
isn't a game of "dids." -MARIA: No, it's not.
-MORIAH: It's a game
of Survivor. I do trust, you know,
 Jem, Maria and Charlie. Where I worry is, Ben
and Charlie chatting, and Ben is the most charismatic
and likable, enjoyable guy
I have ever met in my life. People on our tribe just know
how awesome you are, you know? They know how awesome... ♪ you are. ♪ MORIAH:
 It seem Charlie's
 Ben's, like, special buddy, especially when they're just,
 like, going on hour-long music, song battles. -"Danger."
-"The Last Great
American Dynasty." -"I Love It Loud."
-"Peace." -"Killer."
-"Hoax." -"I Still Love You."
-"Mad Woman." MORIAH:
 Ben can charm anyone. It's a little bit intimidating. You can't just say,
"my alliance member." People change.
People make their own decisions. So, if you had to choose,
who would be first to go? In the long run, like,
who's more dangerous? -JEM: Yeah.
-MORIAH: But... What if Tim has the idol? MARIA:
Are we just assuming
Tim has the idol? MORIAH:
Tim or Ben. -I'm assuming
one of the two has it.
-JEM: I agree. The girls think that
 one of the guys might have
 the immunity idol, but I found a Beware Advantage, and it's a clue to the idol. And nobody suspects
 that I have anything on me because I put the Beware
 Advantage in another tree to kind of get the scent off of,
that somebody already found something. Where's the damn scroll? JEM:
 It's been
a wild goose chase, and finally, everybody knows
 there's nothing there. And that played out
 to my advantage, because now the women
 are on the same page. Either Ben or Tim
are gonna be the next target for us, and then the three girls
 are running the show. This is a beautiful place
to have a salsa lesson, though. ALL:
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, pause. Five, six, seven, pause. I want to see Charlie
get the hips going. Oh, Charlie! (laughing) BEN:
Cha-cha Charlie, dude. CHARLIE:
 It's amazing. I thought it would take a few, you know,
dirty Shirley Temples to get me in that type of mood. But out on Survivor, you're just having so much fun
 with each other. BEN:
Yeah, let's go. Bite that lip. (laughing) ALL:
Four, five, six, seven. Pause. (laughing) CHARLIE: You know,
 the salsa may seem goofy, but it's all
part of the strategy, if you think about it, you know. It's going to be very important
for me to really be in lockstep with my number one ally, Maria. And so, let's switch partners. CHARLIE: We're trying
 to walk the tightrope of the middle of this tribe,
 and you've got Tim and Ben on one side
and Jem and Moriah on the other. So Maria and I
 are really in control. I don't think anyone knows we're really working
 closely together, and that's so powerful,
so I want to keep it that way. (all cheering) LIZ: If everybody's looking,
 I guess maybe I should look. Just got a feeling
that I'm not gonna find it. There's just so many
nooks and crannies to scour. -Mm.
-While we're here... HUNTER: At this point, getting so close to the merge, everyone's worried
about the idol. Everybody's searching
 for this thing. Soda is very blatantly
 looking around. Tevin's out there
 with the shovel, digging. You get that little surge
of excitement when you see something,
and then... (blows raspberries)
...nothing. I have spent so much time
 looking for this idol. I've been digging
 and climbing and, like, going all over the place. I feel like I'm walking by it, and, you know,
 the camera pans to it, and ping, there it is,
 but you don't see it. This jungle is so huge, and there are
 so many small crevices. I want to find the thing, but
 it's just like, "Where is it?" TEVIN:
 I don't know what the hell
 going on with the idol. I don't know
 if there's more than one, if there's two, if there's
 three, if there's none. So I don't know
where to even look. And no one seems
 to have found it. I think every person has looked
 for the idol except Liz. LIZ:
I'm just sitting at the shelter. I keep telling people,
 "I'm not gonna look." I'm not gonna
search for an idol. I can barely find my shoes. SODA:
 Looking for an idol
 is just so difficult. It is so dense out here. It's almost impossible to scour every little inch. There may be one coconut
 you don't turn over, but there's, like,
 a million coconuts. It's exhausting. And at the same time, we don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands. VENUS:
What is that man looking for? I'm gonna go spoil his fun. An idol. In my mind, it's day ten, and I'm pretty sure
that sucker is found. And I guess I was wrong
in assuming you found it. This advantage has really weighed on my mind
because I know Randen found it. And he was medevaced
 with that Beware Advantage in his pocket, so, it's probably
 back in the game. Hunter knows this island
 better than anyone, so, Hunter,
 if you're finding that idol, I will find it with you. I-I'm shameless.
I will literally follow you. And if I'm annoying you,
I don't care. It would be near a landmark, no? I don't know. I mean, in
the other season, it was, like, tied to the top of a bush,
and then, in, like, those little cracks
of those things. And so, I think the era
of the landmark has kind of, like, passed. Yeah. HUNTER:
Venus keeps following me around as I'm looking for an idol. So, I automatically
 just sit down and stop searching. I don't want her
 to know if I find it. Realistically, Hunter, if we do
go into any kind of merge, we have to pick out
who the biggest threat is. People might be thinking you. Okay, but you don't think that? No, I do, but I... So you want
to vote me out today? I don't because
I consider you a meat shield. HUNTER:
 Come on, man. I know that
 I am a huge challenge threat. That's why I'm looking
 for idols and stuff. I wish she would just
leave me alone. Can you believe
we're halfway through and we haven't even
started playing? -It's unheard of.
-It's pretty fun. Thank you. -I'm rooting for you.
-I'm rooting for us, for Nami. After our really cagey, awkward conversation, Venus finally decides
to leave me alone. And then I can get back
to really looking. So much time spent looking
for this stupid thing. And then I see it--
 the Beware Advantage. It's about time. Oh, golly. Forget that.
We're looking at it. I know being the biggest
 challenge threat is making a target on my back. So I snatched that thing up
as fast as I could. "Dig directly below the spot where you found
the Beware Advantage." Well, I started digging,
 and I find a big old box, and the box has a lock on it, but there's a little scroll
 on it. And it says, "There is a hidden
immunity idol in this box, but the box requires a key
to open it." Oh, boy. "The location of the key
 will remain a mystery "until after your tribe loses
 a future immunity challenge. "Once your tribe loses, "return to this location
to receive further instructions. "Until you have taken possession
of the idol, you cannot vote
at Tribal Council." I do want to have this idol, but now I have to wait
 until my tribe loses? Looking at the performance
of the other tribes, it doesn't look like
it's gonna happen very soon. Thankfully, there's a clause
 that says if we don't lose, I still have an opportunity
 to get it. I know that I am in trouble
if the merge hits. I know that I need
 as many weapons and tools as I can have
 going into it, and so, this could be
game-changing for me. KE RE ND IA pr es en ts t he A BC ' s of C KD . C is for Chronic,

of the century. Both guys quickly reload,
but Q is way ahead of Tim. BEN:
Come on, baby, Celtics, baby! PROBST: There it is! Yanu wins their first immunity challenge
of the season... Hey. PROBST: ...sending Siga
to Tribal Council -for the first time.
-(overlapping chatter) -We did it!
-Yeah! Ah! And that is what
a victory looks like on day 11 for Yanu. Smiling faces. Fire! Thank you. TIFFANY: Yes. Nami, once again,
congratulations. (whooping) -Thank you.
-Immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Nami. Yanu, for the first time
this season, the immunity idol
is coming to your camp. -Thank you.
-Along with it, -your flint.
-(whooping) First time in 11 days. Mwah. -(Kenzie whoops)
-That should be
a game-changer, Kenzie. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, this is amazing. PROBST:
Let's just take a moment, since you have been winless. What is that feeling right now, Tiff, to be holding that idol? Honestly... (exhales) it feels so good, but all I can think
about right now is that I'm not gonna wake up
freezing cold tomorrow. It's been so hard
sleeping without fire for the last 11 days.
Like, brutal. I'm just... I'm so happy, Jeff. PROBST:
Kenzie, what's the feeling? It's been a very long
losing streak for Yanu. KENZIE:
This feeling is new to us. All we really know is losing, and we have lost
half of our tribe. So the fact that
we get to keep us together, like some semblance of Yanu
moving forward, it's... You know, we were preparing
for the worst this morning. We were like, "What if
we have to go down to two?" Because that's all we knew. So this is just
a little bit of security in a game
where we haven't had any. All right, Nami,
you also won reward. Large tray of pastries and fruit will be
waiting for you back at camp. Yanu, a smaller tray
of pastries and fruit will be waiting for you
back at camp. Siga, different story. Tribal Council tonight, where somebody from your tribe will be the fifth person
voted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing,
you know what's coming. Sorry for you,
I'm gonna take your flint. ♪ ♪ All right,
before I send you on your way... journey. -(gasping)
-Oh. Nami, you are
in charge of who goes. Just like last time,
one person from your tribe, one person from Siga,
one person from Yanu. Who's going from your tribe? -I'm gonna go.
-PROBST: Hunter's gonna go. All right, who from Siga
is gonna go on this journey? Any volunteers? All right, Tim's gonna
go on the journey from Siga. And you've got the Yanu three. We're gonna let Q go. PROBST:
All right,
so it's gonna be Hunter, Tim and Q on the journey.
Grab your stuff, head out. You will return back to camp
before Tribal Council. Nami, grab your stuff, head out. No Tribal Council.
Nobody going home. -Thank you, Jeff.
-Good job, Nami. -TEVIN: Thank you.
-SODA: Thank you. Yanu, grab your stuff. I know you won't
miss me at Tribal. -Sure won't.
-PROBST: Head out,
enjoy the night off and that well-deserved reward. Thanks, Jeff.
Good luck, y'all. TIFFANY:
Good luck, guys. All right, Siga,
grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at Tribal. CHARLIE:

 Winning feels amazing. I'm feeling the best
that I've felt in 11 days. I'm excited, ready and eager to have a bro moment
at this journey. I couldn't wait. That was a good win, man. -I'm glad
you got your flint, man.
-Yeah. Man. -I'm glad you got your...
I was pissed we lost, but...
-But we-we... -we haven't eaten since
we got on the beach.
-Oh, yeah. -Have y'all had a fire yet?
-No. -I didn't think y'all did.
-Never. Only thing we've had
was one coconut a day. -Wow.
-TIM: Damn. So we're looking at one more
vote before a merge, possibly. -If we get to the merge...
-TIM: Yeah. the physical threats-- it-it's only really three of us. We gonna have to stick together,
regardless. And the only thing
that I can think of is, if you get
one person you trust, -Yeah.
-I get one person I trust, -you get one person you trust.
-Mm-hmm. So if we can do that, -we can make it to six,

-Tiff. -Tiff would be my one.
-Okay. Okay. -I don't know who would be your

-Okay. -Maybe Jem.
-Maria's got the extra vote, so I'm using her as my one. She's strong, and we're both... We're the only parents

-Yeah. Tevin. -And Tevin for you.
-Tevin. -Are we solid on this alliance?
-Q: I'm solid. -I-I swear to you guys.
-TIM: I'm solid on this... Q:
 Hunter, myself and Tim are the biggest threats,
physically. So we agree that
 the three of us pick one person on our tribe, and let's go to the final six. I think that's a good plan. -Want to read this?
-TIM: Let's do it. It's a Survivor knowledge test. We have to decide, as a group,
who will go do this Survivor knowledge test
 and risk not having a vote. I'm a superfan, and I'm confident in my ability. However, my vote is way too valuable tonight at Tribal Council, so I don't want
 to play the game. Y'all superfans? -I'm a pretty big fan.
-TIM: Yeah, yeah. Are you-are you a superfan? If you're a pretty big fan,
I don't know, you might know
some more knowledge than I do. -Q: You'll definitely
know more than me.
-Yeah. -I'm comfortable
with you going, bro.
-HUNTER: Okay. -Best of luck, man.
-We'll see what happens. -Thank you.
-Good luck, man. HUNTER: The journey is awesome because you have an opportunity
to meet people and, you know,
 whatever connections you can have, I'll take. And now, if I can get
a big advantage from this, it would be amazing. Oh, boy. Okay. Let's just see what all we got. The journey is an opportunity
 to test my Survivor knowledge. There's this long table, and you've got
 to put 20 Survivor logos in chronological order. I'm a pretty big fan, but when I watched Survivor, my college roommate was the one
who introduced it to me. And he just
showed 'em to me in order of seasons that he likes,
not in chronological order. And so I was like, "Oh, boy. This is not gonna be easy." Well, we know that one. But I recognize Borneo, season one. Boom.
 First one right there. Let's just start
putting these in, at least. I recognize quickly Pearl Islands because you have Sandra
 and you have Rupert. Yes! HUNTER:
 All from Pearl Islands. That was number seven,
right before All-Stars. We know Parvati
played in Cook Islands, before Tocantins, because Parvati had won
by Heroes vs. Villains. And so we know
 it's Cook Islands and then Caramoan. We keep going.
 I remember Tocantins, which is Tyson,
 like, my favorite player. I just always smell
like flowers and exotic fruits. HUNTER:
 You have Redemption Island, where Boston Rob and them -come back. -You gotta hustle if you want to make a dollar. HUNTER:
 I love those seasons, so
 those were pretty easy for me. Kaôh Rong is, like, the one where Caleb passed out. Panama was before Cook Islands. I think I've been
 doing pretty well. But, also, it's just fun
 to walk down memory lane and be inspired by all the other
people who have played before. Eight was All-Stars. But if this is number seven,
that's not possible. So we have to figure out
where I'm missing something. Golly.
This is gonna be impossible. Why didn't
I watch them in order? I can look at these logos
 and say things that happen in the season,
 but it wasn't questions about what happened
during the season. It was a question of the order. There's a big gap here.
What happens between here? This is 28. This is 22. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. But as you sit there, your brain's not
 functioning at full capacity because you haven't slept well
 and you haven't eaten well. And so you're like, "I really need you
to, like, really kick in and tell me the order." Ooh. Golly. Also, there's this timer
ticking in your head, and you're like, "Did Debbie
come back for a Second Chance or did she come back
for Game Changers? It's nauseating,
frustrating and I'm pissed! HUNTER: Pretty sure she came back
 for Game Changers. And so, as the timer's
 running out, I am as content
 as I'm gonna be. But, you know, if I miss
even one of these things, then I lose my vote. Feel good about these
right here. I mean, that could be the order. Oh, dear. Time to flip. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. (laughs):
No. No. No. No. I got-I got those way off. There, there,
there, there, there. And then switch those two. Not great. Eight out of 20. Not great. That is not a passing grade. I lost my vote because I didn't
know the order of the logos. Which sounds terrible, but if this whole plan works with Q and Tim-- the brochachos,
like, the meathead thing-- that's good for my game. Those connections
 going into merge could be worth
 a million dollars. Always risky to put yourself
on that boat and take a journey, but that's what

-In my whole life. We just won
our first immunity challenge. I have been starving, and after 11 days, no fire, no food,

 like, stuffing our faces. "Give me this muffin." Like... (exhales)

Yeah, like, I know

I'm so happy for us. We finally got our flint. So the record now dies at day 11. Q:
We never stopped fighting. That's what life is about. KENZIE:
 We've held on
 through the 11 days of no fire,
the 11 days of no food, the 11 days of rain, and loss
 and losing tribe members. We've held this little spark. And that was just enough
 to keep us going. Q:
We finally have a nice fire. The first fire on Yanu with a hibiscus flower
in my hair. Just the way I wanted. I'm so excited. We don't have to worry
and, like, fight for our lives. We get to just relax as friends

 our way today, but... -Yeah...
-But, you know, I will say, even though Yanu won, and we're obviously here,
like, people need a moment to feel a little sane. -And I'm glad
they finally got one.
-MARIA: Yeah. MORIAH:
We've had a blessing
of a time out here. 11 days, six strong. Going to Tribal, it's our first vote.
 People are scared. And we have this wonderful, looming question mark
of what idols and advantages are gonna come out
of the woodworks tonight. Maria has an extra vote
 from the first journey. Ben also went on a journey. He also might have
 some advantage or a lost vote. Who really knows? I mean, Tim's on the journey, right? Journeys are terrifying. He could be
 coming back with something. And then, on top of that,
 we have this mysterious Beware Advantage lurking about. And, oh, yeah, everyone has a Shot in the Dark.
Ta-da. Everything
 could go wrong tonight. JEM:
We've never
dealt with this before. So I want to go idol hunting,
and I'm not talking as a group. -I'm talking, like,
idol hunting.
-Just go do your thing. -Okay.
-All righty.
-MARIA: All right. Think everybody goes and does -whatever they want to do.
-MORIAH: Yeah. JEM:
 Oh, my God. I don't have
 a vote for tonight's Tribal. And as soon
as we lost that challenge, it just, like, hit me. I have to go back
 to the place where I found the Beware Advantage, because
 now I get more information to find the key for
 the immunity idol in the box. Oh, my God. Like, this is crazy. I have to go back to camp, get the machete
 to go measure stuff, and I know that I have to do three different tasks.
 And I'm like, "The tribe is right here. Like, how am I gonna
get away with it?" CHARLIE:
All right, dude,
I'm gonna head out there. (whoops) JEM:
 I have to figure out
 how to get my immunity idol before tonight's Tribal Council or I'm gonna lose my vote. Every time I walk this way
 or walk that way, I kind of
 see people in the path. And I was like, "Jem, you got to go.
This is your moment." I have three different places
 to measure. The tribe's flag. I need to also measure the perimeter
 of the tribe's boat. I added it up, and it was 12. Tree mail. And then finally
 the perimeter of tree mail. And it's four. "Boat times logo
plus tree mail." 12 times two is 24, plus the four is 28. I need to go back to where I originally found
 the Beware Advantage and measure 28 machetes
 out towards the beach. Fear crept into my heart. I'm looking to make sure
 nobody's coming. And then I was like, "Okay. Let's go." (quietly): Please, please,
please, please, please. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Hooray. I found it. I dig up a rope with a key. And that was the moment I knew that that's the key
to unlock that box. And emotions,
 like, overwhelmed me. (imitates musical flourish) This is my dream
 coming out here, to find an idol, and I did it,
and nobody has any idea. Now I got to make sure
 that the women plus Charlie are still going strong, so there's no way tonight

he already has something. -So how
do we want to vote today?
-MARIA: I don't know. How many votes? I've got two. -I feel really strong.
-I think we put three on Ben -and two on Tim...
-MARIA: Yeah, two on Tim.
I agree. -Let's lock down on that.
-MORIAH: I like that. -But let's talk to Charlie.
-MARIA: Okay. We have to go
 to our first Tribal Council, which means get
my extra vote from the journey. And I'm willing to use it
because Tim potentially has an idol,
 you know? So I think
 we have to take out Ben, and I think we're four strong
 with Charlie, and so the plan is very foolproof. Maria's pretty confident
Tim has the idol. So that's why
we're gonna put two on him. -So he plays his idol,
and then Ben goes home.
-Yeah. Okay. Ben is the target. Bam. It's like
my heart plummeted in a second. I've gotten very close with Ben
 over the past couple days. Yeah. I'm... I know. It sucks. But he's a really big threat. -Like...

 People are talking about Ben
 as a big-time social threat. He's a magnetic guy. He's charismatic. He's funny.
It's true. You know, people like Ben a lot.
 I like Ben a lot. And I want to keep him around, because, ultimately,
 Ben is an asset. MARIA:
You're back! (whoops) -Let me tell you
about the-the journey.
-Let's hear it. So, the journey is whoever knows
the most Survivor knowledge. Hunter says he'll do it, and so-so I'm not doing it. -Nothing happened.
I didn't get anything.
-BEN: Yeah. I didn't play.
I didn't get anything. JEM: In my gut feeling, I feel like
Tim is not being truthful about the journey. And so we want to vote Ben out,
 'cause that's just an easy vote,
just in case Tim has something. I know that
 Tim doesn't have the idol. I have it. I'm gonna be bringing it
 just in case I need to use it tonight,
 because I'm so worried. Like, Ben and Tim
are up to something big. So I have
 to find out what their plan is for tonight's Tribal Council. -Look, I'm the judge.
I got the gavel.
-Listen... -Listen, I know...
-Uh-huh? ...you and Tim have
a really strong relationship. -Everybody says that,
but you don't... we don't...
-Listen... -Yeah.
-This is Jem, okay? Okay? Okay? -So this is not...
-If you only knew
what we laugh about. -I don't care
what you laugh about.
-Okay. -But I want to be part
of the laugh is what I'm saying.
-Okay. I don't know, dude. -You're holding a machete.

-Honestly, -but, like, whoever you want
to vote for, like, let me know.
-Yeah. I will vote with you,

I'm all about honesty.

 to get some information, 'cause she's gunning for me.

 So I grab the hammer. I'm, like,
 trying to hold my space. -Tonight is do-or-die. Yeah.

straight in the eyeballs.
-I know. I'm not blinking,
and I wouldn't flip. -Trust in your gut.
-It's, like... She's like, "Go with your gut." And my gut is telling me
 Jem's playing at all costs and if we keep her around,
 she's just gonna screw us at the next vote,
because she's so, like... It's chaos mode. And I know she's approached Tim,
'cause I saw it and I heard it. Let me know who to vote for,
and look at me. I will vote with you. You're not looking at me.
Tell me what I got to do. BEN:
I'm just hoping we take Jem out. The problem is, nobody knows
I don't have a vote. -Jem's in chaos mode.
-TIM: Yeah, I bet. I had to grab the hammer 'cause
she was holding the machete. And she goes,
"You know I'm loyal. Like, you know
we can work together." And she just
keeps interrupting me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. BEN:
 Me not having a vote,
 it definitely blows. But, like, Jem-- she's kind of, like, made everybody
feel a little bit on edge. She's on endgame mode. But if you come into a game
 like this already thinking about the million dollars
and you're not thinking about every step along the way,
you're never gonna get there. -Jem confronting
all of us like that...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now, potentially,
you don't have a vote? BEN:
Just assuming
I don't have it, right? If you, Tim and Charlie
stick on Jem, it's still a majority. CHARLIE:
 Maria and I have been
 playing the middle the entire time
 we've been out here. I go back and forth.
I think Maria goes back and forth. And right now,
 we're at that crossroads. Okay. Just tell me
where your head's at. -(sighs)
-(chuckles softly) We can go with the women--
 Jem and Mo-- or we could go with Tim and Ben
 and with the men. This is the thing
that makes me nervous is, I heard you saying that
you're feeling close to Ben. Just, like, you feel
bonded to him, and... So I'll tell you
where my head's at with Ben. We need threats in front of us. -He's a shield.
-Yeah. And he is a charisma
rock and roll shield. MARIA:
 Clearly, Charlie's more keen on working
with Ben and Tim, but, you know,
 trust is a big deal for me. I think working with Jem and Mo, we have a much deeper amount
of trust. Like, I don't... I don't trust Ben and Tim. I have flip-flopped
like a kid on a seesaw, because I think that Jem will be loyal to us
 down the line. We have to think long-term. CHARLIE:
 Jem and Ben both have reasons
to catch votes tonight. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay. All right.
-Let's do this. Jem's playing really hard,
 making people be very wary of her. So you don't hit me
with the machete. CHARLIE:
 Ben's strength is his humor, but that's just as dangerous
as it is fun to be around. Tonight, we find out
the alliances. MORIAH:

 no more flip-flopping. It's all about Maria and I putting our cards on the table

I want to go to the well." -"Okay, we're coming."
-Five hands. And all six of us walk
to the water well and to tree mail. We go to bed together, we wake up together. -PROBST: Well, Charlie?
-Yeah. What all of that equals to me is
massive blindside tonight. I'm no math guy,
but it seems like you've got the equation right. You know, we don't have
a Hunter or a Q. How we survive is by
being scrappy, by being gritty and working together.
That was necessary for us
to all get to day 11, but we're starting to feel
the heat for the first time. It's not just smoke. There's
a whole lot of fire around here. PROBST:
Moriah, was there
much talk about -idols or advantages
in the game?
-MORIAH: Oh, yeah. There's the possibility
of an idol out there, and I don't know
how many votes may be at this Tribal at this point. People may have zero votes. Some people may have two. There may be four extra votes
cast tonight. Actually,
I'm really bad at math, so that doesn't totally add up
to me right now. But I get your point, is that
there's this uncertainty -because of journeys
about who might have what.
-Yeah. Yeah. MORIAH:
Yeah. And then, we're a hot mess when it comes
to, like, Beware Advantages. We've had, like, a laundry list of debacles over at camp. CHARLIE:
Jeff, Maria found what we assumed
was a Beware Advantage. All the advantage says
is "dig down." So we get digging, and we get
digging, and we get digging. And then we rip the whole
tree up, and there's nothing. And all six Sigas have been
pouring a whole lot of energy into a whole lot of nothing. -Over three days,
-Emphasis on "hole." PROBST:
So, Maria, what's the conclusion that you've come to? -That you haven't found it?
-MARIA: Well, that's a really
good question, Jeff. I think that it must have been found
by someone else before me. Yeah. So, Jem, you're in
an interesting dilemma as a group of six because
you formed these relationships, people that you like
and want to work with. So was there any debate for you about who you wanted
to vote out tonight? I'm sitting here
and I am lost for words because I'm still
trying to think who I might want
to put on the parchment. And there's no name
that's coming up. Like, can I write
your name down? -(laughing)
-You can't write
my name down, Jem. I'm here forever. Sorry. Sorry. Permanent immunity idol. So, Tim,
what is about to happen? Because even right now,
everybody's smiling and yet a name will be written down, and I'm guessing
one of the six of you are going to be
very surprised it's you. -Am I right?
-You're absolutely right. But we might just
all be playing a very, very good game
right now so that nobody feels targeted before we all start
marching up those steps. Maria, that rings very true. It does.
I think that we all, deep down, know
what we're gonna write down. I think all of us are lying by saying we don't know
what we're gonna do. Jem, do you think
that's a group feeling or is that just
where Maria's at? I think nobody
wants to rock the boat. Just thinking about it,
there's so many options, right? If you want to move forward
in this game, you have to be able to,
like, trust the alliances you made right now. Ben, is it possible that
tonight's vote does more damage than just one person going home 'cause you can no longer
trust everybody? BEN:
I mean, that's always
a possibility. I know I'm still getting
a Siga tattoo either way. You know?
We've all talked about it. But, um, yeah, obviously, you never know
if somebody's gonna feel like they were on the bottom,
and if we get to another side, why would I want to work
with those people in the merge? So you never know, but
that's the thing about Survivor. One vote,
one challenge at a time. Hopefully,
you get to your long goal. PROBST:
Charlie, how will this tribe be different
after tonight's vote? CHARLIE:
I think it's a test of can this tribe face a loss
and still be the vibe tribe, or is the vibe tribe a mask
that we've been wearing and after tonight, it's been ripped off
and it's not coming back? MARIA:
But I think, Jeff, that at the end of the day,
we have to separate emotions and game. Easy to do? Very difficult to do. PROBST:
All right, it is time to vote.
Tim, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'm so scared and so nerding out
at the same time. BEN (whispering):
No vote. We'll see how it goes.
All right. (whispering): "...is when there
are six players in the game." I'll go tally the votes. If anybody
has an advantage or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. Okay, I'll read the votes. First vote: Ben. Jem.
One vote Ben, one vote Jem. Ben.
That's two votes Ben. Jem. We're tied.
Two votes Ben, two votes Jem. Jem. That's three votes Jem,
two votes Ben. Fifth person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jem.
Need to bring me your torch. Jem, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Grab your torches.
