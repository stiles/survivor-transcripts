 Previously on Survivor... MARIA:
 Q is a number that
 I can use to vote with me. I definitely want
 to keep him around. Q kind of blew up his own game and has been causing chaos
 at camp. Tonight, I'm betting I can keep my idol
in my pocket because Q is going home. -...it's gonna be
really, really bad.
-Right, but... Kenzie is having cold feet,
 but at some point, you've got to make a move. We can take Tiff out tonight. Maybe we don't tell Kenzie. If I keep waiting
 for the light to turn green, it may not turn green. We have one chance. So I'm gonna have
to run the red light. TIFFANY:
I don't think that anybody here thinks
that Q is best for their game -at this point in time.
-And yet the last two Tribals, everything was swirling
around Q. "Q's going home.
Q's going home." Nope. Still here. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Eleventh person voted out and
the fourth member of our jury: Tiff. The tribe has spoken. Thank you. (sighs) I broke my own Survivor rule. I should have played my idol. ♪ ♪ KENZIE:
Final seven. -Final seven.
-Holy crap. Wow. This Tribal was the first time
I've been left out of a vote. And it's the worst. It's the worst feeling ever,
because I'm like, "What did I do
to not, like, be... in the club?" Like, who...
Did I... Like, why am I not trustworthy? Like, I'm so confused. And I'm mad because this was my idea
 to blindside Tiff, and now somebody else
 is getting the credit. Like, I'm mad at myself
for not seizing the opportunity. Ugh.
I just feel so dumb. I feel so dumb. I was having this whimsical,
 amazing time. I just let the game
 get away from me. I got blindsided, too, you know? I don't know if you want a hug
right now or anything. I... -No, I...
-I don't even know. -I just, like...
-Yeah. Like, why wasn't I included,
you know? -Yeah.
-Like, I know people
were probably worried -I would tell her.
-I think that was the worry... Which I understand completely. I mean, I'll just say this. -It wasn't my move.
-Yeah. -Do you know what I mean?
-Was it Maria? -Yeah.
-Yeah. I knew it. CHARLIE: There's always
 fallout after Tribal, but this vote
 was different because everybody who returned
to camp voted for Tiff except Venus and Kenzie. And the way
 they were left out left them really feeling bitter. So, my thinking was,
 talk to Kenzie because this game is
 all about working with people, adapting to what's
in front of you and keeping your options open. -It's a great move. It's-it's...
-I know. -It's my move!
-I know. -That's why I'm so mad.
-I know. Right now, we just have to,
like, bide our time, you know? There's no time.
There's six days left. -Well, it's, like...
-And I just, like... Just, like, find
the right moment, you know? I have to find that idol,
is what I need to do. This is the first time
I've been wrong in the game, but maybe
 this is what I needed to get my head back on straight
 and realize I came out here
 to play and to win. I'm just gonna have
to get a little bit more crafty, pay a lot more attention. I can turn this around. -Final seven together, huh?
(laughs)
-Yes. -We're gonna rock out, Ben.
-Oh, we're rocking out already. We're gonna have a good time. We can have our final five
right here. MARIA:
Yeah, it'd be a good final five. This Tribal couldn't have gone any better. Oh, my God. (laughs) This vote was my idea, and I was able
 to get this group together-- Q, Liz, Ben, me and Charlie-- and just pull off
 an epic blindside. And it was just, like, the sweetest feast
I've ever had. (laughs) This has lit such a fire in me. I do see the end, and I'm like,
 "Is it possible that maybe
 we are the final five?" I could do this again.
Let's do it again. (laughs) The blindside-- even though
we were on the wrong side of it, was a blessing in disguise. -Yeah.
-We got rid of big competition -and Maria put a huge target
on her back.
-Yeah. Let Maria think
this is her move. Don't give off the fact
that you're upset, and realistically, it's gonna
come and bite her in the ass. Maria's played
a very low-key game where everyone can tell
she's a potential threat, but this is the first time she really
let her freak flag fly, and she's announcing
to the world, like, "Hey, this is my move and I'm here to play." And it's scary
because Maria has a strong three with her, Charlie and Ben. Siga three needs
to be broken up. Yeah. But tomorrow's a new day,
and we're still in this game. -Exactly.
-Yeah. KENZIE:
Day 20. Ugh. What a mess. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -Morning.
-Good morning. Ooh. MARIA:
You sleep okay? KENZIE: (short chuckle)
Oh, no, I did not. It's all good. I'm, like, shocked
Tiff didn't play her idol. MARIA:
I guess that means it's time
to start looking, right? KENZIE:
Yeah. (mouthing) Q: With Tiff idol leaving
 in her pocket, we're thinking it's gonna
come back to play at some point. We don't know if there's
 something out there just yet, but the only way
 to find it is to look for it. I know. Okay. CHARLIE: Idol fever has struck Nuinui beach. MARIA: Yeah. CHARLIE:
 It was sort of
 a domino effect this morning. Q started looking,
 then I started looking, then Ben started looking,
 then Venus started looking, then Kenzie started looking,
 then Maria started looking. And everybody's looking for... (imitates drumroll) ...Tiffany's idol! ♪ ♪ CHARLIE:
 An idol at this point
of the game changes everything. So, as much as I don't
 want to look for an idol because I'm exhausted
 and starving and want to save my energy, it's a necessity at this point. VENUS: At last Tribal, for the
 first time ever in this game, I was on the wrong side
of the vote. So, I need to flip the script. I need to find this idol
 and I need to find it quick. Q:
 I've looked from the front to
the back to the top to the side. Oh, man. I'm exhausted. VENUS:
 I've gone through probably some
 of the toughest times that I've ever had
 in my life here. But today, the thing that calms me down is A: I know this island
better than anyone, B: I know
where Randen found his, and C:
I know where Tiffany found hers. So I have something
to work off of, of where to look
and where not to look. And I'm like, "You know what?
 People are going hard. Let's go through literally
 every single corner." And I take my little stick,
 and I'm pushing leaves, and I'm pushing leaves. And... I found it.
 I found it first! And I was so ecstatic. I immediately started
 to walk away so that I could go find
 a corner to read it. But then I realized,
 like, "Hey, that is not the move right now." So I U-turn it, and
everyone's still up and looking. So, I bide my time. And it's so hard. MARIA: Yeah. As someone
who's been looking for 20 days, it's so hard to hide the joy
and excitement that is building up in my heart. Where's Liz? (snoring) I'm gonna go around the bend
and come back. Wish me luck. And finally, I'm alone. "Congratulations. "You have found
a hidden immunity idol. "When played at Tribal Council, "any votes cast against you
will not count. "The last time this can be used

This is sick. I have the idol in my hands. And it is just
 an amazing feeling. Like, "Wow, Venus, "you're not blind,
you're not stupid. You actually got this." And if I play my cards
 correctly, I make it to final four. Like,
 "Hey, you underestimated me "since day one, and look who's here,
and look who's not." [ si re ns b la ri ng ] No, stop! Once in a generation

 of the vote sucked, but I have definitely, like, thought about it, and I was
just... I got too comfy cozy. I wasn't on my p's and q's. I wasn't paying attention. Trying to balance
 your own individual game with a group of individuals that all have
 their own individual games... Everyone's lying. You never know
 who's telling the truth. You don't know
who's working with who. Ugh. Even though it feels like
we're on the bottom, we're in the perfect position of being in the middle
of this... this war. KENZIE:
Right now, like, the only person that hasn't lied to me
 is freakin' Venus, which is hilarious, but, like, really, she's the only one
who hasn't lied to me. I'm so curious
as to what her next move is because she's not
really hiding it. KENZIE:
 I like Venus now.
 I like her as a person. I never
 in a million years thought we would be
 working together, but here we are, me and my messy,
sweet little friend. I don't see it. (Venus laughs) KENZIE:
 Venus is just, like,
 looking at trees, and is like, "It's not here."
 And I'm like, "You have to move some leaves,
honeybun. Like, what are you doing?" It's not looking good. KENZIE:
 Venus' technique
 for idol-searching, I think, is to follow around people
 that are idol-searching and wait for them to find it.
(laughs) Girlfriend is not
 really looking hard. She's, like, kind of does this
with a stick, and she's like, "No." And meanwhile, I'm, like, digging holes, and she's like... Any luck? (laughing):
I'm like, "Venus, what?
What are you doing?" I doubt it. KENZIE:
 Who knows? Maybe she has it, and she's bamboozling us all. But... I think
she's just waiting for someone
that's close to her to find it so she can have the tea. VENUS:
 It is so relieving to know that even though people are
 still scattering about, looking for an idol, I don't have to worry
about going out and, like,
solving a riddle, or, like, going and finding a second part
to this idol. I have it. But no one will
 ever catch a whiff of me having this because I don't see any benefit in-in someone knowing
that I have this power. Oh, my God. I know.
I cannot believe it. VENUS:
So it's very much a timing game. Like, when is the right time
 to play this? No, she shouldn't. -People were just
really good at lying.
-Yeah. So, it's stressful,
but it's so comforting. It's, like,
the sweet, sweet comfort. Like, I want to... Mwah. I love you. It's, like,
I think this is my best friend on this island right now. Hello. What's going on? Okay. -We have lots to go through.
-Yeah. First of all, congratulations. Thank you.
I'm happy to have had my moment. -We have not... even talked.
-That was, like, amazing. -That was amazing.
-Yes. I'm so glad
to have been a part of it. -I'm really proud of you.
-Thank you. -That was... that was...
-It was scary as hell. -That's big stuff
that you pulled off last night.
-Yeah. -That was big stuff.
-I know
what the repercussions are, -but, like...
-Yeah. Thank you
for doing that with me. Oh, my God. Of course, you know? Maria wanted the Tiff vote
to be something that she drove, she controlled, 100%, because the more
 you can clearly claim that a move was your own, the easier it is
 to sell and to pitch to a jury
that's looking for a player who had real influence
in the game. And that's where
Maria's head is at. But it's also
 a very double-edged sword, because Maria getting all the
 credit from the Tiff blindside has made her
a huge, huge target. I mean, people would be silly
if they didn't see that, like, you and I
have been working together. You're a threat. We voted cor...
voted correctly every time. -Every single time.
-Taken out three people. -You're a threat, I'm a threat.
-Yeah. -I did want to talk
to you about Q.
-Okay. What are you...
Where's your head at on him? I think we can use Q
for one more vote, -because Q trusts me,
and I trust Q.
-Yeah. -I don't know how that happened.
-Yeah. Like, I do think
he would vote with us -for one more time.
-Yeah. I've been playing this game
 with Maria since day one, and we have been lockstep. We've been talking about going
 to the final three together. But Q is,
 as far as I can tell, in Maria's pocket,
and I want him out of the game. So this move and the buildup to this move
is really where... I have seen my thinking and my route to the end maybe start to diverge
from Maria's. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Luckily, people have realized
 Maria is a huge threat. Nobody likes Q, so he's kind of
on the outs as well. So the two big threats--
 Q and Maria-- have made themselves
 very well-known. They are peacocking, for sure. Like, everyone can see that
their tail feathers are out, and that the attention's
on them. Maria-- she got to go. I thought she was just... a sleeper. -But Charlie, yesterday,
came to me, he was like...
-Yeah. "That was a game-winning move,
and it wasn't mine." -And I was like...
-Okay. "Well, there's hope." I mean, I want Q out, but... Maria is obviously
running things. -Yeah.
-What do you think? Oh, I think it makes sense. -If we can pull it off,
then Maria's got to go.
-Okay. KENZIE:
 There's seven of us left,
 and we need four. So the best thing for me is to
figure out who I can work with to get Maria and Q out of here, and then at the final five,
we can battle it out from there. Kenzie, have you
checked the beach? I'm gonna be honest. If Q doesn't get up and look
for it again, I'm gonna assume -he has it.
-Okay. And Maria's been gone alone
for a long time. LIZ:
That's what we're talking about. -Yeah, that's what
we've been talking about.
-VENUS: Okay. And she will think again
next time before leaving us out of a vote. It's not about that.
It's about... -she's the kingpin.
-She's... She's the kingpin, she... She's got the best story,
the best moves. Yeah. No, she's got to go. VENUS:
We will have the majority. A hundred percent. I am certain one
 of the Siga three may be open to potentially working with us,
 especially with Charlie. I've questioned
 how strategic he is, how cutthroat he can be,
but it seems like he's seeing that writing on the wall
 and realizes that he can't go to the end
 with Maria no matter what. And eventually, he's gonna
have to cut that cord, and I hope he sees
 that now's the time, while everyone's still on board. KENZIE:
Okay, so what are you thinking? CHARLIE:
I think Q is in Maria's pocket. Oh, 1,000%, he is. -Yeah?
-It's not even a pocket anymore. It's like she has, like, a...
a full bank vault that Q is stuck inside. KENZIE:
Yeah. CHARLIE:
I was not...
I was not cruise director... -Yeah.
-last night, you know? -KENZIE: Ugh.
-So...
-VENUS: That's so funny. CHARLIE:
 In the buildup
 to the Tiff vote, I wanted Maria
 to have sole credit because I need someone that I can sell as
the biggest target in the game. If that can overshadow
 any attention on me for the moment, that's probably what's best
for my game right now. At this point in the game, -there's seven people.
-Mm-hmm. And that has somehow
become the strongest pair. The whole stuff with Q
and that whole vote was a big... -I think, a big wake-up call
for probably everyone.
-Yeah. Charlie and Maria
 are super close. They're in the Siga alliance. But Charlie has no real
 résumé moves, and he knows it. He has been Maria's, like, jester
for this whole game. And he's-he's a smart kid,
he knows that. So I think Charlie's ready to make a move on Maria. So, who would you rather
go first? Too early to say or... I think too early to say, but... We'll just see whoever wins
and go from there. I'm just saying.
Yeah, 'cause, like, I feel like anyone could win. I've been building trust and relationships with Kenzie and Venus so that I could,
 if I wanted to, make a move
against Maria and Q at any point. I think we... we all know
what needs to be done, or else we're all screwed. VENUS: They will win. -Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. So they are, like, public enemy number one and two right now. CHARLIE:
 At some point,
 I have to ask myself, "Is going to the final three
 with Maria handing Maria
 a million dollars?" You have to start
thinking about your own game. And I'm feeling... my gut start to go
in two directions. One way is gonna win, and it might be
 making a move against Maria. ♪ ♪ Help your family

your competition. -There's a lot going on.
-There's a lot going on. I mean, Liz has been
eating some rice. She's been sharing with Venus. Ben's been falling apart. He's completely depleted. Q took me
on the reward last time, and so I feel
like I need to take him. And so there's, you know...
Charlie didn't go on the reward. It's a really hard decision.
How many people do I get? We'll find out.
Right now, you got one. Okay. I think I'm gonna pick Ben. PROBST:
Come on over, Ben. CHARLIE:
You go get it, buddy. (sniffles) (sniffles) (crying) This is crazy. PROBST:
All right,
there are five people left. You're gonna bring
one more person with you. Which means three of you
will have pizza, four will not. Walk me through
who you're gonna choose. Um, for me, it's more,
like, my mindset is more like who is physically falling apart
right now, and it's not about competition or who I want
to work with or whatever. It's just whose body is failing. I'll take myself
out of it, Maria. I think there are people here
that need the food more than me. All right, Venus,
Liz and Q, make your case. Um, I've lost weight. I would like to eat,
but it's your decision. I want you to pick
whoever you want, you know? I mean, I still
haven't pooped in three weeks, so I'd like
something to get moving. You know, I ain't too proud
to beg. (laughs) Love that song. I think whatever decision
you make is completely fine, Maria. You shouldn't-you shouldn't
feel guilty, either way. ♪ ♪ I've never seen
a moment like this, ever. -46 seasons.
It has never taken this long.
-(laughs) PROBST:
Nobody's given this much
thought. That's not a criticism. That's just an observation. Okay. Liz and Q, rock paper scissors. Pick rock. (laughs) Paper covers rock. Is that it? -Yep.
-Q, come on over.
-KENZIE: Wow. (quietly): Wow. PROBST:
We don't need
to belabor this anymore. Tribal Council tonight. Somebody will be the 12th person
voted out of this game, become the fifth member
of our jury. You're gonna go back to camp.
Maria, Ben and Q, you're gonna have
an afternoon with pizza. The other four, got nothing for
you. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. KENZIE:
 I am shocked. Maria is like, "Liz and Q,
play rock paper scissors." What? Liz has made it
 very abundantly clear that she's starving. If you just want to take Q because he's your number one,
 just say that. Don't be like, "Oh, I want
 to take care of the people who haven't eaten," and
then take the guy who just ate. Makes no sense. My jaw, I'm still picking

"Venus, make your case," I'm like,
"I'm sorry. I'm not gonna beg. You know, physically,
where I'm at." CHARLIE:
Uh, when she said,
"Rock paper scissors," I was like, "Oh,
it's gonna be Liz and Venus." -Me, too.
-And I was like, "Liz and who?" I knew it was gonna be Q. KENZIE:
I cannot believe she said,
"I'm just trying to judge it
on whose body's breaking down." -I know. And then...
-Can I just say, I would have respected her
so much more if she just picked who she picked, but
the fact that she prefaced it -by saying that and

It's still in his stomach. CHARLIE: The pizza picking was a bit of a... for lack of a better word,
a ... show. I thought, for sure,
 Maria was gonna choose Venus or Liz, but Q ends up going. And let me tell you,
 the four pizza losers were pissed. -KENZIE: What the ...
-VENUS: She went from being a hero to a villain real quick. To emphasize being this,
like, mother to all, caring about everyone. I'm so done, like, being quiet
when someone ticks me off. So, what are we
doing tonight-- Q? He's evil and self-centered
and selfish. -My God.
-I know it's a game,
but, like, geez. The veil has been lifted. I had a feeling Maria and Q
 were working together, but now it's just blatantly
freaking obvious, and I cannot respect anybody who is playing the game
 with that jerk. -I mean, did you know
they were so close?
-CHARLIE: I... As far as I'm concerned,
Q's Maria's number one. -That's...
-Q's an idiot. -(groans)
-It's the classic Survivor "If you can't
go for your target, go for their number one." I was just piling everything on. "Maria's the worst. "They're such a tight duo. I can't believe
she's working with him." But since Maria has the necklace
 tonight, the pizza losers want to vote out Q. Which is great,
 because Q is someone that I want out of the game,
 and I want him out soon. Okay, so, we don't think
Q has an idol? -Definitely not.
-CHARLIE: Uh... I am 97% sure. Charlie, thanks
for listening to me vent. -Oh.
-I know you and Maria are close. -I'm in my feelings right now.
-We are, -but, I mean...
-VENUS: That's different.
That's game versus... Things have been turning
a different corner, you know? BEN: Damn right. -I slowed down.
-I just want to say
thank you so much. You're so welcome, Ben. If a look could kill... ...I got slaughtered today. (Ben chuckles) MARIA:
 Liz pierced me with her eyes. BEN:
 Mm-hmm. MARIA: I was gonna
be damned either way. Yeah. Yo, Liz does have rice. MARIA:
That's what I'm saying. That's why I was like,
well, what's, you know? -Yeah.
-Kenzie just ate. Charlie's like, "Don't take me." -Yeah.
-So I'm like,
"Well, that's the right move." -Q: Mm-hmm.
-BEN: A hundred percent. MARIA:
 I'm sure I pissed people off, but winning this challenge
 gives me peace of mind. It means that I am safe tonight, and that gives me
 a lot of power. At this point, there
 are still three Siga members. So with seven people left-- although it's
a very unpopular opinion-- I got to keep Q happy right now. Q is a number for me. He trusts me, and I trust him. They know you two are tight. -It's a little obvious
at this point.
-Yeah. And they know
you and Charlie are day-ones. MARIA:
The three of us. Exactly. -That's all we need.
-That's all we need. Really. Yeah. -Q: Is that ham?
-Yeah. -I think it's ham.
-It's ham. Q:

-MARIA: Yeah. Yeah. Liz is less likely
to win immunity than Venus. -BEN: Yeah.
-MARIA: Right, right. -Yeah.
-Venus came super close today. -I know. I thought she had it.
-But... MARIA:
I say it's time to get her out. Q:
 Venus is the real problem with all the complaining, and the pushy and the running and telling
this story to this person. And, also, she has the greatest
 shot at winning immunity, as we saw in this challenge. She is a problem. So she needs to go. The negative vibes
have been a bit much. MARIA:
Yeah. Any chance Venus found the idol? No. MARIA:

 The pizza winners
 come back to camp, and we do our classic niceties. "How much did you eat?
 Was it delicious? Oh, tell us all about it.
 I'm so glad." Even though, seconds before they arrived, man, I thought that the people
at camp were gonna eat them. It was tense. I'm happy with Maria's
 choices for me, but it really put the heat
on her and Q. I know they probably been
pitching me this whole time. -Yep.
-Just got to let them know -that's not happening, so
they don't write my name down.
-Okay. Yep. -In case V pulls out
an idol, but...
-Okay. the real plan is Venus. Okay. Okay. At this point in the game, I want the burners turned up
 on everyone but me. So if I can hide this vote
when I don't have the necklace, and all of a sudden, everyone's
eyes are on Q and Maria, this is great. I mean, I did. I just... I feel really bad, and I'm not really sure
how to talk about it. Honestly, Maria,
it was really weird. -We were all like, "Wow."
-MARIA: I know. There's no way
to win that situation. And I told myself,
"I never want to win reward because I don't want
to have to make that choice." And I knew I was gonna
piss people off and I just, I apologize
if I hurt anybody's feelings. There was just, there was no way to make
everyone happy in that choice. Oh, I completely
agree with that. I just can't stand Q,
and I just don't know why you would
want to make him happy. 'Cause he's
such an ass to everyone. He does nothing around camp. He used all the firewood in,
like, two hours. I'm done not expressing myself. MARIA:
Okay. Yeah, go for it. LIZ:
That is my mindset, Maria. I guess that's what
I've learned in Survivor, is, like,
I've spent my whole life just letting myself be angry
and not speaking what I'm really feeling for the sake
of someone else's feelings. And I think, honestly--
this sounds crazy-- I think that's why
I have so many ... allergies, because
I've suppressed my own self for so long that my body
started attacking things. So I've said my piece. I feel better.
Thank you for hearing me. Normally, I'm not someone
 who holds grudges, but with Q, it just feels
a little more personal. For some reason,
 he just keeps surviving. And I'm getting more and more and more and more
and more and more irritated. MARIA:
 I felt like I hurt you,
and I didn't like how that felt. I was just shocked about Q,
because I'm like, "He's a jerk." -So...
-The thing is, Liz,
is that, like, the only people
that are talking to me are Siga people and Q. That's it. -You know?
-I feel like the only person
talking to me is Venus. And I don't believe
anything she says. She's so all over the place. MARIA:
Well, that's another reason
why I can't work with her. I can't understand
her game at all. Ditto. And so I guess
that's why I come to you, because it's like... I liked working with you
for Tevin. I liked working with you
for Tiff. I like the fact that you said, "I'm here to play the game.
I want to play the game." But, like, let's play the game. Right now,
 having not had a chance to talk to everybody,
it seems like the ladies want Q out, and Q, Ben and I have
discussed getting Venus out. And so, Venus and Q are
 gonna be the targets tonight. It's my hope
 that Venus goes home, but, you know, you never know. Like, as the sun starts
 to go down, sometimes things change and people scramble,
 and then a new plan comes out. In my mind, the people
I'm working with are solid, but I guess that's
a silly assumption. ♪ ♪ Yeah, I know. I'm, like... -I know. I know.
-Okay. Are you and Ben doing Q? I don't know about Ben. KENZIE:
 Well, Ben can do
 whatever Ben wants, but, like, -if you're gonna write Q,
we're good.
-Yeah. It doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. If an idol comes into play
at six, and Q gets it and Maria wins immunity,
then we're screwed. -Yeah.
-Like, we'd be so dumb
to not get rid of him -right now.
-Yeah, I know. -We've got to do Q.
-I know. I don't think Q's a bad person. I don't think Q's evil, but... I'm fine with
other people thinking that, because, ultimately,
 down the line, I want a final four that doesn't
have Q or Maria in it. What is your ideal final four? -Final four?
-Yeah. 'Cause, frankly,
we got to think about it. I've been thinking about that. 'Cause a four at six
controls the vote. VENUS:
 Charlie's in a power position. He's kingpin right now. And based off of discussions from today
and previous to today, just based off
of my relationship with Charlie as a whole, I think that
 Charlie really understands trust goes both ways. And if he sticks to the Q vote tonight, I'm gonna give him
something in return next time. Can I tell you,
I've got your back. -And I've got...
-I've got yours, too. I've got
some things up my sleeve. -I feel like we'll be fine.
-What does that mean? You don't have
to worry about it now, -but I feel like in terms of...
-I am worried about it. No, you don't
have to worry about it. I'm saying us,
final four, is locked in. For tonight's vote, sure, I have an easy out.
I can just play my idol. "Oh, there's a risk of me
going home. I can play it." But that's not what
 wins the game for you. It's about using it correctly
 or not using it at all because your social game
 is that good. And so, even though
I have a guaranteed way of going into
tonight's Tribal stress-free, I don't even care. I don't want to use it because, for me, if I get this correct and I get to save the idol
 for another vote, then that just
speaks to more of why I deserve to win this game
in the end. We'll make it to final four. No. Okay. That's why I was... That seemed like
things up your sleeve. Or maybe I do. (gasps) -Who knows? No, I don't. But...
-Oh, Venus. We-we will be close
after this vote. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay?
-Yeah. Venus alluded to someone-- maybe her-- having something
up their sleeve, as an advantage or some sort of extra spice that could
 shake things up around here. And I was trying to get Venus
to tell me what the heck it was, but she kept being very cagey about it. In terms of idol,
I really don't think Q has it. I don't think anyone has it,
unless you do. -Unless it's up your sleeve.
-No. (chuckles) No, no, no. -There's something else
up my sleeve.
-You're being all shifty. -No, I...
-What else is up your sleeve? There's something else
that's going on that I'll tell you about later,
but it's not an idol. And that's why I'm so adamant to
find this idol, too, by the way. Yeah. I'm curious why
you're not telling me now. -Because I want Q out for sure.
-Okay. And as soon as Q is out, we can have an open discussion -Yeah.
-about everything that will
guarantee us final four. -Okay. All right. No, no.
-And that's like, that's like... -I trust you. I trust you.
-Handshake.
No, handshake promise. -I trust you.
-Okay. CHARLIE:
 I'm trying to set up
 a final four deal with Venus, and she's stonewalling me on
something incredibly important. That, to me, is a red flag. So I've just got to think
about how to play this in a way that it doesn't sink my game. V talked to me,
 and she was like, "I'm totally cool going
to the final four with you -and Ben and one other."
-Of course. -'Cause she's a poser.
-Yeah. The other thing that V said is that she alluded to some advantage that somebody has. So it would either be her,
Liz or Kenzie who has it. BEN:
She's saying whatever
she can to get out of tonight. "I want to get Q out." -Yeah.
-V has got to go. Q is a heavy target
 we got to get out of the game, but at the same time,
 Venus also does have to go. My reason for Venus
having to go has nothing to do with her being a threat. She's just creating more
 and more chaos. She freaks out
 before every Tribal, and she's always running around
trying to pitch some crazy plan, and I'm sick
 of being around that. So I'd rather get her out first
before we get out anybody else. CHARLIE:
 My head is going in 22 different directions. It's being
pulled every which way, and I just have
to hope that I can figure out what's best for my game. But right now,
it's a big old storm cloud. KENZIE: Okay. CHARLIE:
...and they're gonna play it. -Venus is chaos. I don't
want Venus here, either...
-Yeah. I trust what you want to do. Okay. So whatever-whatever... KENZIE:
 I think that
 the boys are being babies and don't want
 to make a big move because they want
 to feel secure. Because if they get rid of Q, then they're more vulnerable. But I'm like,
"If I get rid of Venus, then I'm more vulnerable." I just think it's foolish
to not take out the biggest threat in the game
while they're vulnerable. CHARLIE:
 The middle is a safe place
 to be and a dangerous place to be. It's a double-edged sword
and, frankly, it's a sword that has
a point also pointing at you. -I know.
I didn't know where you were.
-I was like... Even though
I might have power tonight, I could make a mistake that
sinks my game moving forward. So it's Venus, right? Is that what you're hearing? Yeah. The way people are
 talking about Q and Maria, working with them
could taint my image. Right now, I know
 I'm a little bit of a threat, but people are not mad at me. After tonight's vote,
 my main concern is can I pull people
 that I've burned back into a position
 that benefits me? And I don't know
 if I can do that if I burn people
 who are so dead set on getting Q out tonight. It might be the last straw,
 and I might be public enemy number one
 for stringing them along. So it's really, really tricky

a couple of Tribals ago because I was expecting something fun,
so I did bring the cushion. MARIA:
All right. And tonight,
I didn't have popcorn, so I brought some licorice. -Damn!
-(others exclaiming) Oh. So I am really... LIZ:
Oh, my God. -...ready to go tonight.
-(laughing) -VENUS: Jeff...
-BEN: Jeff, that's foul. PROBST:
But look, I can't

to be a bad host. I really like licorice when I'm
watching my favorite show, so... I'll give you one. -You got to figure out
what you do with it.
-(groaning) -This is Survivor. -VENUS: Oh, my God. Cool. BEN: Of course

-VENUS: No. -Thank you.
-KENZIE: Thank you. All right. -CHARLIE: A new taste

-Thanks, Jeff. -Thanks, Jeff.
-CHARLIE: That's pretty good. I can eat licorice. KENZIE:
Yeah. Thank you. All right, so, let's start with one of
the craziest challenges. At any given point, any one
of you could have won it. Maria, you win,
and you get to bring two people. It's the longest time we've ever spent
deciding who to bring. So how did that go? The first decision
for me was really easy, but then you have
to start weighing, like, am I fueling my competition? Am I fueling my alliance? Am I feeding people
who are malnourished? Like, how do I
make this decision? And I had to give Q a chance and I wanted
to give Liz a chance. And I said,
"Let's rock paper scissors, 'cause I can't
make this choice." Venus, you were clearly upset
that you weren't chosen. VENUS:
It's one thing to decide
who you're gonna take with on a reward,
but to start off by saying, "You know,
I really want to choose someone "who is physically weak and really needs
this reward, health-wise," and then put on this farce to ultimately choose the most
well-fed, fittest guy here-- it kind of felt like
a punch in the gut. -It kind of felt cruel,
you know?
-An act and a farce is... that's, to me, like daggers. That was the hardest decision
I had to make today. So if she
can stand there and say, "That was an act and that was
a farce," I'd love for her to take that spot
and make the decision herself. I wouldn't
have prefaced the decision with that kind of comment. I would have just
made my decision and just been content with it. But, Jeff, if Venus
would have won the reward, she wouldn't have taken... -No way. (laughs) No way.
-Q: ...uh, Maria. She wouldn't have taken me.
You know what I'm saying? -We'll never know.
-Q: So... Uh, we know. -Trust me. Okay.
-We don't know. You can't sit there and say,
"Well, Venus never would have picked me,"
'cause you don't know. So... You wouldn't have. And that's a fact. Wow. Charlie, what's your take? CHARLIE:
So, I think the big theme
of this pizza reward is really "decisions." And no decision in Survivor weighs as much as who we are voting out at any given Tribal Council. So, you're thinking about who are you putting on the jury? Who are you leaving in the game
to work with you? And at this point in the game,
who am I going to sit next to at the end and have
the jury judge me against? Everything has consequences, and it makes this game just incredibly, incredibly hard. PROBST:
Kenzie, let's
talk about blindsides. When you're the architect
of a blindside, it's great. And yet you can't tell people because there are idols,
there are advantages. Tonight's the last night
you can use Shot in the Dark. Does that get
more and more pressurized as the days
get closer to the end? It's extremely pressurized. I mean, I got bamboozled
by a blindside last time, and it wasn't even me. So when it's getting down
to just seven, and everybody's telling you all these
different things, it's, like, so layered and weighted,
and you just have to put your faith in these people who
have literally blindsided you, even if it's not
your name written down. It's very jarring. Liz, it's really interesting
to hear Kenzie say that. That you get blindsided,
and then you might actually have to work
with the people who lied to you. Amen. I've been incredibly vocal. (laughs) I don't know how else to say it.
And I'm just... About what? (groans) -Okay, one more time.
One more time.
-LIZ: Sure. (groans) (sputters) -I'm just feeling...
-Okay. You've been
very vocal about what? About Q.
I mean, come on.
I-I feel like I... (groans) Like... Everybody's talking about,
"Oh, I want to make a big move. Let's blindside.
Let's do this." I feel like I can't
trust anyone right now. It's like... Yeah, the-the Q and Liz
rock paper scissors. And it was like,
okay, in my head, Maria wants to play
with Q more than I thought. I don't know. It's... bleh. PROBST:
Q, did you hear your name
in the same way you have for the past few Tribals? Q:
Oh, yeah. I heard my name today. But, again, Jeff,
I approach the situation the same every time. You tell me something.
I tell you something. We agree. If I believe it, I'm going on about my way. If it's a lie, you will
put my fire out tonight. That's how I go.
I'm not gonna worry about it. But, you know, with the people that I've talked to, it seem like everybody's
on the same page. I don't know
if that page is my page or someone else's page. I guess we'll find out. Venus, how would
you describe camp today? Today was a bit different,
because up until the last vote, I've been in on what was
gonna happen, and like Kenzie, I was on the wrong side
of the vote for Tiff. So, although I felt like
I could trust everyone before, now it's like I don't know
who's telling me the truth, who's lying, which way
the vote's gonna go. 'Cause people just
love writing my name down. Oh, my name is out there,
as well, Jeff. But to be fair, everybody here knows to never, ever, ever, -ever, ever, ever, ever
-VENUS: And yet he did. -say a name in front of Venus.
-And yet he did. Why is that, Q?
Why do you think... Because what Venus will do is she'll come
up to you aggressively. -Never.
-"What do you want to do?" You tell her a name,
this is what she's gonna do. -Run and tell this person.
-Straight-up... "Oh, Liz said this."
This person. -"Q said this." This person...
-With Q, specifically, Jeff, -I made sure
not to talk strategy.
-No one talks game with her. -I'm done talking about it.
-VENUS: I would never
in a million years try and talk strategy
with this man voluntarily. And that's a fact. And last vote
proved that exactly, -with what happened to Tiff.
-Q: That's why you didn't
know about the last vote. 'Cause they didn't trust you. Mm-hmm, but I knew
about the previous three, and you didn't, so... -Ooh.
-(exclaims) -PROBST: Ben...
-(chuckles) ...every Tribal,
while entertaining, has been complicated. I don't think I've seen the cynicism and paranoia be played up to 11 the way it's been
the last few days. This is a prime example that some people are just
not gonna be on the same page. It's about making
it through the next vote, because one crew that will
do one vote together is probably
not gonna be a crew that'll do
a second vote together. And it's
been this constant shift since the beginning
of the merge. PROBST:
So then, Charlie,
what do you do? Sooner or later
you have to walk up those steps and write down a name. What is the final decider?
What do you go to? CHARLIE:
Even if you can't
trust someone, can you somehow point yourselves
in the same direction? You know, set up
your row of dominoes all in a line and make sure that they all tip over and send the right person home
for your individual game. So, you have to be
able to persuade people to point in the same direction. And I think that's
what tonight's about. All right.
It is time to vote. Kenzie, you're up. ♪ ♪ Please get off the island. I'm sick of all your lies. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right.
I'll read the votes. First vote: Q. Venus. Kenzie. So, that's one vote Kenzie, one vote Q, one vote Venus. Venus. Two votes Venus,
one vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Venus. That's three votes Venus,
one vote Kenzie, one vote Q. Twelfth person voted out and the fifth member
of our jury: Venus. That's four. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch. -VENUS: Great job, you guys.
-Love you, boo. Love you. Great game, sister. Venus, the tribe has spoken. -Great game, you guys.
-Time for you to go. -VENUS: You killed it.
-Bye, V. Grab your torches.

 of Barbados. Definitely harder than it looks. KEOGHAN: Angie got
 into the swing of things at the Roadblock. -DANNY: Yes, Mom! Come on!

-Damn it. KEOGHAN:

 Cesar continued to dominate. -Another first-place finish.
Congratulations.
-Yes! KEOGHAN:
Rod and Leticia were stumped... -How?
-What are we missing? ...and stuck.
