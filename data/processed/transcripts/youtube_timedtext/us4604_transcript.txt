JEM: My heart's beating
 really superfast. It's a friggin' lockbox.
 It says, "The location of the key
will remain a mystery until after your tribe loses
 a future immunity challenge." Oh, my God. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... BHANU:
 Tiffany and Q -are really tight.
-Amen. And Kenzie's a mastermind. LIZ:
 He tells us everything. It is a gold mine
 of information. (sobbing): I need a miracle. Q:
 Bhanu is a liability,
 but Kenzie is a threat. So I want Kenzie to go home. Oh, my God. -LIZ: Hey, Doc!
-RANDEN: Hey, it's Jeff. PROBST:
Randen, it's about your arm. Just being very cautious
about your health, we are pulling you
from the game. Randen was pulled from the game, which means
no Tribal Council tonight. (gasps) PROBST:
Nobody going home
from this tribe. (laughing) Q:
 Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close she came
 to going home. ♪ ♪ I can't-I can't believe it. Believe it. I know. I am. We are lucky. For the first time. -For the first time, we're...
-It took seven days.
We're lucky. I think this little break
 really could change the Yanu tribe's trajectory. You know,
we've been going like this. All we need is one little spike
in the market, you know, that's it, to shoot back up. BHANU:
Group hug. -I love you guys.
-I love y'all. -Yeah.
-I love you. Second chance. We're not out of the race yet. This could be the turning point. We've got a good base, and now we've got
 a chance to build upon it. I'm feeling good about it. Why? I said something wrong. TIFFANY:
What? I said,
"Kenzie's the mastermind here." I just... That's one thing I said. And they... they-they said, "Are Tiff and Q, like, close?" I was like,
"Yeah, they're close." There's nothing
wrong in that, right? Is that close?
Is that-is that bad? I kind of don't really
want them to know how close me and Q are,
'cause then they're -gonna try to split us up.
-But they always
see you guys like this. So they've asked me
that one question. I-I'm just, like,
being so clear. So there's just, like... 'Cause then they're
gonna try to break us up. That's all I said.
And that's it. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Mm. Huh?! Boy... If you can't realize that going to a journey
 to meet two other people from other tribes,
and they're asking you questions about players on your tribe,
 that they're pumping you for information,
you are a liability. -He going over there
telling people that we close?
-I-I can't. I can't. I-I can't. -There's no more
going back to it.
-Bro, like... Now, he put a target
on Kenzie back, and he put a target
on both of our back. -He got to go.
-Yeah. TIFFANY:
 And I wonder what
 you said about yourself. I'm sure he's probably like,
 "You know, I'm just on the bottom right now,
and I'm on my way out the door." Probably made himself look
like some friggin' sob story. And everybody looks like
a big threat except for him. Yep. Done. TIFFANY:
 If I would have voted out
 Kenzie and kept Bhanu and then found out
 all this information, I just would have
jumped headfirst into the ocean. I'd have been so pissed. About the Kenzie thing? About all of it. Did I say something wrong? Q: Not only
 did he put a huge target on Kenzie's back, which I don't really mind. Now the target on my back
is not only "curious, young, "he's athletic,
he's a physical threat. "Oh, by the way,
add the fact that... he's a duo with Tiff." Oh, man. That "yes" had so much meaning. Ah, ... BHANU: I shouldn't
 have said that to them, but I said it in good faith
 because I wanted to be honest with my tribe. (groans) BHANU:
The target on Kenzie was on and
we were going to Tribal Council. Everything is gonna go
 according to the plan, and me just
spilling everything out... (sighs) It just messed
the whole game for me. And he was like, "Yeah, that's
because she's the mastermind, and she's
running the show over there." Bitch. Target number one,
two and three-- me, you and Q. He just... Aah! Like, I'm so mad at him. -Are you dumb?
-After we reamed him at Trib-- about the Jess Tribal? He's literally like a toddler.
Like, when the oven is hot, and you're like,
"Don't touch the oven." And he does and then he cries. TIFFANY:
Why would you ever say that? -In Survivor... -'Cause he doesn't know
how to play Survivor. -And...
-Why did he even come out here? He could have just gone camping. -Like, what was the point
in him even...
-Deadass. -If you want to win
a million hearts, go volunteer.
-Oh, my God. I still want to win and I still want to stay
tribe strong, but Bhanu -is a liability.
 -TIFFANY: What... a Looney Tune. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I need some help. If I'm taking any wrong steps, mis-miscalculations,

 Yesterday, I really,
 really screwed up, and, um, I-I don't know

a reward has really -upped our spirits.
-(Maria chuckles) Do you all think that people,
they're gonna be like, "How silly is it
that these people have not found an idol yet?" -JEM: Oh, my God.
-CHARLIE: Yes. They're gonna be like, "They're
just, like, hanging out." JEM: Right now,
 nobody knows that I found the Beware Advantage first and that I actually
 have replanted it. I want someone else to find it to kind of send them
 on a wild-goose chase to basically
 get the scent off of me. -MARIA: We should
have something by now.
-MORIAH: Yeah. MARIA:
Jem, you looked in here, right? JEM:
I did not. Every time that
we would go to the water well, I can see it. But my job is to act
like it's not there. I was like, "Yeah, I think
it might be hanging somewhere." MARIA:
Wait, guys. CHARLIE:
Did you just actually find it? MARIA:
I literally
just looked right there. CHARLIE:
Oh, my God. -TIM: Is that it?
-Yes, it says Beware Advantage. And then Maria spotted it. And I'm like, "Aah!" (laughs) And I threw it, 'cause I'm like,
"It's the Beware Advantage." -If you open it it's yours.
-Well, we're just gonna peek. We're just gonna have a look.
"Beware Advantage. "If you take it it's yours
and you must do what it says. Otherwise, leave it." MARIA: It's a little kumbaya to, like, be idol-hunting
 as a group, but... I'm gonna go for it, because
without taking this risk, there's no way I'm gonna get that extra advantage,
 if it is one. -Let's go.

-Let's go, Lieutenant Mom. Drumroll. (imitating drumroll) What do you got to do, Maria? It says... CHARLIE:

There's so many ants in here. -CHARLIE: Oh, God.

the dangerous big black ants.

Those ants are huge. MARIA:
The ants are massive. JEM:
 So now there are these giant black ants

gonna get attacked by ants?

 In Survivor, your job
 is to play as hard as you can, but it's also okay to have
some fun while you're doing it. Who would have thunk?
Group idol hunt, eh? JEM:
We were just talking about... What? Ah... -MORIAH: Fake idol, yeah.
-CHARLIE: That'd be wild. -MARIA: That would be funny.
-That-that would be. Finding a Beware Advantage,
 replanting it, have somebody else
dig up a tree. Like, that's the fun part. -MORIAH: We all ready?
-JEM: We'll be back. And my hope is that I'm able
 to pin it on someone else. Yeah, let's go. So I'm having fun on Survivor. So that's exciting. (laughs) -TIM: Great work, Maria.

Getting your first look
at the new Nami tribe. Randen was pulled from the game. -Oh.
-Oh, man. Oh, my... Hi. All right,
so just to catch everybody up, Randen was suffering
with an issue in his arm. It was a pinched nerve,
but our medical team was very concerned
about possible long-term damage, so we had to make
the tough decision to end Randen's journey in favor
of his long-term health, which means
there was no Tribal Council. Nobody from Yanu went home. That tribe stays intact. TIFFANY:
Thanks, guys. Shall we get
to today's reward challenge? -Yes.
-(whoops) PROBST:
 All right,
 for today's challenge, you're gonna paddle your boat
 in from the ocean, collecting a key along the way. Once you reach the shore, you'll use that key
 to unlock four rings. Each player is then
 responsible for getting one of those rings
 up and off that pole. Once you have all four rings,
 you'll dig under a log and race to toss those four
 rings back onto another pole. First two tribes
to finish win reward. -Want to know
what you're playing for?
-Yes. Food. Show me food. You want food? You got food. LIZ:
PB&J! (all exclaiming) Told you. PROBST:
First tribe to finish, ten decent-sized fresh fish delivered to your camp, along with a bamboo cooker
and a diagram for how to use it. Second tribe to finish, smaller but just as appetizing. -Five decent-sized fish
will be delivered to your camp.
-Yeah, let's go. All right, sit-outs. Nami, you're sitting
one person out. Who's it gonna be? Venus gonna sit out for Nami. Siga, you're
sitting two people out. Who's gonna sit out? -Yeah.
-Me and Moriah. PROBST:
Moriah and Ben will sit out. All right, sit-outs,
take a spot on the bench. Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it.
-(whooping) PROBST:
All right, for reward. Survivors ready? -Yeah.
-Go! -One, two, three.
One, two, three...

One, two, three. Great. -Okay, stop, stop.
-Q: Go. BHANU:
Yeah, keep going, keep going. Siga! Nami! PROBST:

Yanu, congratulations. -Your first win of the season.
-LIZ: Wow. -SODA: Yeah, Yanu!
-KENZIE: Thank you.
Thanks, y'all. -Wow.
-You're okay. Don't cry. PROBST:
All right, Yanu,
you've earned ten fresh fish, good size,
delivered at your camp. But I know what you're thinking. You don't have flint,
so you have the option to trade this reward
for an earlier one. So if you wanted to trade
for the large tool kit and the large tarp and give
up the fish, you can do that. Those fish will not
do us any good right now. So the large tarp and tool kit. Large tool kit, large tarp will
be waiting for you back at camp. -Hopefully that will
change your lives quite a bit.
-LIZ: Yeah. Hell yeah. Nami, five fresh fish will be -waiting for you back at camp.
-Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you. PROBST:
Nami, grab your stuff,
head out and enjoy those fish. -TEVIN: Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you.
-We sure will. PROBST:
Siga, got nothing for you.
Grab your stuff, head out. Yanu, grab your stuff, head out. Well done. Welcome to the game. KENZIE: We didn't only win, we demolished. We beat them by a landslide, which is the opposite of what's been happening to us
 this entire time. It's, like,
the momentum that we needed. Our core four is finally
 getting it together. And that is why

-Where's the fish? I really wanted
to cut and clean the fish because my dad
showed me how to do it, and I haven't done it since I did it with my dad. ♪ ♪ I had been trying to go fishing
with him for about three years, but I was
 so busy with my career and I kept being like,
 "Oh, I can't do it." You know,
"I can't do it. I can't do it." And then the time to do it
is eternally past. My dad passed away about ten months ago. And so I didn't get to fish with
him that one last time, so... It was just nice to do something
 today that was just, like... Dad's right here. We had a very
 powerful relationship. When I didn't have a car, he gave me
 his one and only car, so that I could get
 back and forth to high school. And he had no transportation. And he called me
 every single day just to say, "Hey, how are you doing?" One of the hardest parts
about him passing was that, the day after he passed,
my phone didn't ring. -SODA: Wow!
 -LIZ: Wow. We ready. -Beautiful.
-TEVIN: Here they are. -SODA: Aw.
-Um, my dad taught me
how to do this. And this is, I think, the first
time I've done it without him. -But, like, I did it.
-LIZ: Oh, wow. SODA:
That's the way to fish, baby! TEVIN:
 So I was filled with pride
 to know that something my daddy taught me
 is coming into play right now. And I'm about to give
 this thing that I have crafted to these people who need it, which is what he was all about. So he lives on. (gasps) Wow. -Fantastico!
-We did it! We finally won something. (singsongy): First place.
Who would have thought? That's crazy. We really
bodied that whole challenge. KENZIE:
Yeah, we did. TIFFANY:
 We blew those other teams
 out today. Oh, that's real big. But this win
 was bigger than us just winning a tarp and some tools. This could definitely be
 a turning point for our tribe. If we could really
 get our stuff together, we might
not have to lose anymore. Go to your right. Go to my... Opposite side of the girls
right now. I'm exactly at
the opposite side of the girls. -Go to the other side
of the shelter.
-KENZIE: Go that way. Onto the girls' side. TIFFANY:
No, we-- You are on the girls'
side. Go to the other side. Q:
 I know that if we go
 to Tribal next, Bhanu is the one
 that's going home. But if he's going to be around, I have to make sure that Bhanu is the best player that he can be. Just stay in the moment,
stay in the current. But I think there's so much that Bhanu don't understand
and don't know about the game of Survivor. We have to fix
your social and strategic game to where it's not a liability. So what I'm doing is taking
 my time to actually train him, and that is my job as the coach. We're having coaching sessions. Hopefully I can teach him how to keep his mouth shut. You need to be thinking
about every moment. From here on out, start playing
conversations in your head. In this game, you have a lot of people
who want to manipulate you. They ask you questions
and they buddy you up. -Mm.
-And you feel like, "Oh, my God.
I got to give something back." No, the ... you don't. My training with Bhanu
 is training his emotions, training his speech. So you don't want me
to talk strategy at all? Teaching him techniques to use in general conversations
with others. Tonight, who you voting for? I don't know who I'm voting for. -Would you vote Tiff tonight?
-Oh, yeah, sure. So you're voting Tiff? So that right there
was a bit too much, 'cause you jumped on it
too quick. Oh... Q:
 And I'm teaching him how to talk at Tribal. So, Bhanu, what's going on at your camp?
We're merged. This is Jeff talking to you. We're vibing with everybody. You know, it's-it's cool. And when you say "we,"
who is we, Bhanu? Everybody.
I'm vibing with all of them. Perfect, Bhanu. BHANU:
Is that Jeff or coach talking? Oh, okay. Q:
 I'm not very optimistic about his approach
 going forward, but if the little bit
 that I can teach him can help, I'm going to continue to try. What did you learn? Tell me. Ask me the same question, coach. -KENZIE: Just-just tell me...
-No, just tell her
what you learned. BHANU:
So, this is what I learned. When Jeff asks, like, "Hey, Bhanu.
So what's going on?" I would be like,
"Things are good, you know? We're all
vibing with each other." I'm glad you're practicing. I want to practice
with you, too. We'll have more sessions. -I'll have more.
-Mm-hmm. I'll-I'll have it
with Kenzie, too. -Kenzie?
-Yeah? I am helping you. Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, you are now. -I will help you.
-Yes. I just want to enjoy our win
for, like, five minutes. -I want to not
talk about strategy.
-Oh, sorry. I'm just gonna walk away. You have
the patience of a saint. I snapped at Bhanu because you are probably
15 years older than me. Like, I... shouldn't have
to help you play Survivor. And, of course, Bhanu is like,
 "I'll just walk away." I'm like, "Okay. Go." I'm over it.
 I'm over babying Bhanu. It's so annoying. BEN:
Let's start with the positives. This was
just a reward challenge. And I want to say that even in the face of all the insanity, you guys were still a team and I couldn't
be more proud of y'all. So, you know, Maria, I know you feel like
the weight is on your shoulders because it was
that whole situation. But I still did it. -You still did it.
-Yeah. But, yeah, also, every single
person out there believed in you and trusts you and doesn't
put any ounce of blame on you. JEM:
And we don't even-- -It's just fish, Maria.
It's not that big a deal.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:
You know what? As immigrants, success was survival
for my family. And so we grew up where we had to be perfect. And so I never wanted to fail. So many times I wondered, like,
"Am I enough? Am I good enough?" You know? And this was, like,
a big, big place... to fail
in front of a lot of people. Growing up, our parents
 wanted so much for us. They came from Lebanon
 to this country and worked so hard. And so, you know,
we-we were pushed hard. We were pushed with this
 sort of fire in us to succeed. And when there were moments in life
when I didn't, you know, I was hard on myself. What I've worked on
the last couple years is shedding the shame...
(sniffles) the shame and the guilt
behind not succeeding. And just knowing
that it's a moment in time, and that doesn't define
who I am. BEN:
Listen, Maria, you're gon-- I know you're
taking this loss hard, but it's gonna
be a lesson for you in more of that
letting go of shame. -Yeah.
-BEN: You know what I'm saying? So either way,
whether we had the fish or not, -it's gonna be a positive.
-OTHERS: Yeah. -BEN: All right?
-Thank you. (Charlie whoops) Let's not forget,
we also have a Beware Advantage we can look for, too. -Yeah.
-All right? Because of Maria. -All right?
-CHARLIE: Yeah. JEM:
That was good. CHARLIE: This Beware Advantage,
 it drives me nuts because Maria and I
didn't get to control this potential really valuable piece of information. -MORIAH: Ready to do this?
-MARIA: Diggy, diggy. CHARLIE:
 She got so excited that she told
the whole damn tribe and, all of a sudden, this whole big group effort is going on. That's reason one
to be frustrated. I mean, this is insane. This is under a tree. This is, like,
we're digging in a tree's roots. Reason two is we can't freaking find the thing. We've dug so far
under this crazy tree. -This is a serious hole we dug.
-This is, like, unreal. CHARLIE:
 And there's nothing.
 So what the heck is going on? Because
 the next most likely option is that someone
planted it there. This feels, like, comical. We've dug out as far
as you can go under the spot. So, like, where is it? Either that
or somebody's being sneaky -and found it in another tree.
-MARIA: Someone-- Exactly. BEN:
Jeff, where is this thing, dude? Jeff don't lie. A few fundamentals in Survivor: One: Jeff will never lie to you. Two: Jeff will never
give you anything impossible. TIM:
If Jeff put this in the tree,
he's good, 'cause this is absurd. MORIAH:
 So maybe Jeff is not the reason
we're digging there. JEM:
 It's great. My game is going the way
I intended it to go, 'cause I wanted the suspicion
 to be off of me -and onto someone else. -Ah. What's the suspicion? MORIAH: We're thinking
Tim might've planted it. JEM:
'Cause, Maria, nobody else was, like, going as hard
as he was. He's overcompensating to take all the suspicions
off of him. I mean, that's
a massive possibility. JEM:
 The idea that Tim might
have the hidden immunity idol-- like, that's what I wanted. I came to play Survivor, and I'm playing as hard as I can
with what I'm given. Ah .. . so me o f th e mo st br il li an t mi nd s in b us in es s. No, not you. Or you. You! You auto-track business income and expenses

is gonna go and do stupid ... I left the camp because,
 all of a sudden, Kenzie-- she just, like,
 snapped at me. I'm being treated like...
nobody. They're not respecting me. I'm so stupid. I had so much power in the game
and now I'm like a puppet, and they're the puppet masters. They're like, "Do this, do that,
do this, do that." And this is what I get. I've seen all the seasons
 of Survivor as a superfan, but when it comes
 to social skills, it's still not sinking in me. Everyone feels like
 I'm a dumb dumbo. "Oh, we need to teach him how to walk, how to talk." So I became a robot,
so I'm no longer a Bhanu. I'm just, like, you know, I... They're like puppeteers
and I'm a puppet. It feels... it...
I-I don't like that. Take your moment. I'll go apologize.
I don't want him to spiral. I snapped at Bhanu, and then, because I know he's emotional,
I know that I have
to go run damage control so that Bhanu doesn't think
everybody's mad at him again. Bhanu? I'm, like, one foot
 in front of the other just trying to find this man
 so I can apologize... Bhanu? ...when any other person
 would be like, "Maybe I shouldn't
enlist her to, like, "train me on how to do the thing we came out here
to do right now." But we have to make Bhanu
 feel good because if we go on a winning streak
and we take Bhanu to the merge, we need him
to stay loyal to Yanu. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Like, we are a tribe. We want to keep our numbers. We need you
to be successful at Tribal. Like, I'm here to help you. -Thank you. Thank you.
-'Cause we need you. And I know it's hard. I feel so bad that
here is this old child-man -that needs help.
-It's okay. I love you.
All right, we'll get through it. BHANU:
Kenzie came to me and said like, "I really... I apologize." Makes me feel better. And I was like,
 "Okay, you know what? Uh, bygones, bygones." Thank you for understanding.
Cool. BHANU:
 I can take some lessons. Like, you know,
 I know it's very important for my game,
 for everyone's game. If so many people
 are putting work into me, I think I need
to put some effort in it. -LIZ: Perfect.
-TEVIN: There you go. All right, I'm gonna wash shirt,
pants, socks. LIZ:
If anybody sees some dirty orange underwear... -TEVIN: Ooh.
-SODA: Right there.
-...holler at me. I haven't
washed my shorts at all, and then these two undies. I feel like
 my game's going pretty well. There's five people
in this tribe. I personally feel like
there's a solid three with Hunter, Tevin, and I,
 which leaves, on the minority, Liz and Venus. LIZ:
I found my underwear! Yay! But you have a lot of downtime when you win because
you do not have to go to Tribal. Guys, I just realized something. Those two little triangles
at the bottom of our flag look like slices of pizza. Even though I'm pretty good
 at just being, like, kumbaya, your head has to constantly
be in this game. You know, I like
to check in and stuff, see where people's heads are at. You know I really want
to connect with you. I want to stay connected to you. And you are
my confidant out here. Like, it's 100% me, Liz, you, Tevin and Hunter. There's nothing
that this fab five cannot do. If you're even out of the game
for a second and you get stuck, that's it. You will be out like a light.
 You'll be gone. -Like, what...
-I feel like she knows that, like, we are tight, and I feel like that three going
into the merge is gonna be super powerful three. And I know this is tight,
so I'm not worried. Hmm. Soda is a social butterfly,
 as am I. However, she's playing the game
a little too hard for me. -Soda. -TEVIN: There's moments
 where I'm watching her, and it seems like she's having little whisper moments
 behind my back. -We're all vibing, but...
-Yeah. I'm down for individual vibes
because I love everyone. TEVIN:
 I'm just a little worried
 that she may be playing me just as
 she's playing everyone else. And it breaks my heart to say it
because I do have a connection with her
 that is so deep. But the target in which
 I am seeking to hit now is shifting. And so now
 I need to be the one to get into everyone's head
 and plant seeds. For tribe strength,
I would rather get rid of Venus than Soda, but you already know that Soda is playing a real... game. I would rather
keep our game alive and have a weaker tribe than... So are you saying, just making it seem like
 it's Venus, and then we just
 switch it to Soda? HUNTER:
 I think that's
 the safest 'cause... TEVIN:
 'Cause she wouldn't expect it? HUNTER:
 She wouldn't expect it. Yeah. I actually have wanted Soda out
for a while because she's my competition
for closeness with Tevin. So whenever Tevin
 started expressing doubt in Soda, you know, that sounds great to me.
Let's do it, right? I just want to ask, if we have
to go to Tribal Council, how do you feel if we were...
had to vote Soda? Because my gut is telling me, "Tevin, you got
to play the game." And if playing the game
means that I have to get somebody out of this game who I think
is manipulating everyone... To be honest with you,
I think she's the one to beat. This is great news
 for me because I really have this feeling that if Soda makes it
 to the merge, Soda is on her way
 to final Tribal Council, and I cannot have that. Yeah. TEVIN:

 are on board. Like, Soda got to Go-da. Pa in h it s fa st . So get relief fast. Only Tylenol Rapid Release

Got to take back the idols. Thank you. Thank you. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,
 one at a time, you're gonna climb
 to the top of a tall tower and leap out into the ocean. You're then gonna climb up onto
 a crate, jump back into the ocean. Two players will be responsible for releasing
 a net full of buoys. Once everybody's at the finish, one player will attempt
 to land those buoys in three baskets. First two tribes to finish win immunity,
safe from the vote. Losers, Tribal Council where somebody will be
the fourth person voted out of Survivor 46. And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint. Yanu, day nine. You are still fighting to get yours.
All right. Sit-outs. Siga,
you're sitting out two people. Cannot be the same people
in back-to-back challenges. Who's gonna sit out? It's gonna be Jem and Maria. All right, Nami,
you're sitting one person out. -Who's it gonna be?

on Survivor in the first place. I'm so sorry, Bhanu. I've given it my all
for this game. Ugh! (sighs, sniffles) I'm so mad. I'm so mad. Oh. (sniffling) What can I do? Can you find me an idol? Tiff, you need
to help me to... Please? -No. Please, Bhanu. No.
-Please, Tiff. Please. Get up off your knees.
What the hell are you doing? -No, I will not. I will not.
-Ah, bro, please. -Tiff, you need to help me.
You know...
-No. Get up. First of all,
I'm not gonna talk to you if you're on your knees.
I'm not gonna do that. -I need you to stand up.
-Tiff. All right. I'm gonna
keep it honest with you. I'm gonna
write your name tonight. I'm just being 100% honest.
I am writing your name tonight. Can I-can I ask you what...
the reason behind that? -Yes. Yes.
-Please. I feel like I can't trust you. I'm sorry that, you know,
it has to end like this, but I hope that
you can respect the fact that I'm at least
being honest with you. -Gotcha.
-Can I have a hug? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
I screwed it up for us. It's fine, Bhanu.
Don't be sorry to me. It's fine. (sighs) This is it for me. Nine days is what... ...is written for Bhanu. I have to just accept it. Namaste. Thanks to the island. Thanks to everything here. I realize that honesty
has no meaning in this game. A momentary truth caused... so much. I learned a lesson a hard way,
 that, you know, five seconds of my honesty
 ruined my game. That's how hard this game is. But guess what? I figured that I'm such
 an emotional person. I'm a very good person. I'm a loyal person,
 I'm an honest person. And that's what
 my journey's been. I am going home tonight. But tonight, you know what? I'm gonna tell my story because they still
 don't know my story. And I'm so glad that I got
 a chance to play Survivor. It's not about
 the million dollars. All I wanted to do
 is win a million hearts. My m ot he r us ed t o te ll m e a st or y. Of a demon king, and his army. They brought terror

All right. I'd like to go back, since we didn't get to
have Tribal last time, and talk about the journey. Bhanu, you were selected
to go on that journey. How'd that go? I went on this journey and, um, I lost my vote. Not only that,
but I revealed that Q and Tiff, when I asked, like, are they working together,
I said like, "Yes." And then I also said, like, you know, Kenzie
is a good game player. PROBST:
Tiff, did you ask Bhanu what his motive was
in giving away this information? TIFFANY:
Yes. I don't know if I've got an actual answer, but it seemed like
he didn't understand that by revealing
that information, he was putting a target
on all three of us. Like, I just don't think
he understood in that moment that he was getting played. PROBST:
So, Bhanu, is it that
you want to play that way or is part of it figuring out how to play Survivor and
you're still figuring it out? Jeff, the first
six days has been... Like, I'm not clicking,
like how to play the game. Sixth day,
the moment it clicked, and then, I spilled the beans
to my Tribemates. So when I'm trying
to get the game, the game took over,
and I dug my grave so deep, I couldn't come out of it. PROBST:
So I'm getting a sense that... You're already nodding.
You finish. What was I gonna say? That Bhanu
is going home tonight. -Is that what's happening?
-Yes. I told Bhanu straight up,
I'm writing that name down. -Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I have to write his name. And Bhanu, you don't have a
vote, which means you can't play -the Shot in the Dark.
-No. PROBST:
It requires a vote to sacrifice. And this would then
make me think that you've all talked about
idols, and you don't have one. I've searched nine days, Jeff, for an idol, and I've done everything,
but I don't have anything. I don't have a vote,
I-I don't have an idol. I don't have alliances. I screwed up this game big-time. Well, it's rare
when this happens, but I find it intoxicating because there's
no deception happening. You're not trying
to blindside somebody. You've all been honest
with Bhanu. -Yeah.
-PROBST: Honest. The word of Bhanu's whole time
out here-- honesty. So, Bhanu,
what is your Survivor journey? -What has it been?
-Jeff, the reason why I'm on this show is because I want to share my story. I told them that
I had a very good life, but that's a lie. (laughs) I was born into poverty
to a teenage mother, and was abandoned
by my maternal father when I was three months old. -And where were you?
-I was in India. After a few years,
my mom got married, moved to a different city, and I
was living with my grandparents. And can you describe
a little bit -what poverty is like
in India for you?
-BHANU: Yes. So, the poverty
is just like the camp. -That was my house in India.
-PROBST: Literally? -Like, a thatched roof?
-A thatched roof, yes. And that's how I grew up.
I grew up literally on streets. But I learned to be honest
and help each other, and that's how we all survived. I put in a lot of effort,
and I am the first one in my entire family
to graduate from high school, first one
to have a graduate degree, first one to actually move to United States. And I also found my partner. So, all these things. So, the reason why I wanted
to be on Survivor is because there's so many Bhanus
still out there, still living in poverty. So all the Bhanus
out there, listen. There is always hope,
and you can move mountains. And if I can
come from that place, a lot of people can also do it. But, unfortunately, this is how it... it's ending, so, it's on me. Thank you so much
for this opportunity, and thank you, tribe. -Thank you for
sharing that with us.
-Yeah. Yeah. Q:
You know, Bhanu, I want you
to understand, brother, you've done a great job with the man
you've become today. And the man that you were
in our tribe showed us that, man, we could count on you
for a lot of things. PROBST:
You know, Bhanu,
one time you said to me, I am your guru, -which I took as a compliment.
-Yes, sir. But also, remind yourself you're your own guru. What you've done
with your life is remarkable. And I say this all the time. The game of Survivor is about the adventure, putting yourself
in this environment to see what you're capable of, and that's what
you've been doing. You won my heart, Bhanu, -all of our hearts.
-Mine, too. Seriously. All right, Bhanu,
when you're ready. Bhanu, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Thanks for being here. Love you, Bhanu. Q:
Love you, man. (Bhanu sniffles) (crying quietly) (sniffles) Grab your torches.
