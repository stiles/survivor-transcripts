 Previously on Survivor... SUE:
 Kyle wanted me out. I am gonna get revenge. ROME:
"Congratulations." This is exactly
what I needed, baby. I feel like
I'm running this game right now. TEENY:
 I feel a close
personal connection with Aysha. But if Aysha won't work with me, is it worth
 keeping her in this game? If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it... One second, Jeff. I was able to get an idol that's good
for one Tribal Council, so I'm gonna use it now. First vote: Sol. Third person voted out
of Survivor 47: Aysha. The tribe has spoken. ♪ ♪ TEENY:
 Sol... Yes? TEENY:
You got anything to say
right off the bat? I'm glad I'm still here, but, uh, yeah,
I mean, you guys got me. Well played. At Tribal Council tonight, my ass got blindsided. And the people who I thought
 were my allies, Kish and Teeny, they went against
what I thought was gonna happen. And Rome is still here. That's what
 I'm more upset about. We know who Rome is.
We know what kind of guy he is. -ROME: I know you voted for me.
-Yep. And, uh... It was part of the plan--
what I thought was the plan. And you voted for me? No. -SOL: Who voted for me?
-We'll talk. SOL:
 I'm at the bottom of my tribe. I have to quickly get over it,
and I have to get my mind right. Otherwise, I'm going home. -I just want to say I'm sorry...
-Okay. ...because I voted for you,
and I need to explain that. -You voted for me?
-Yes. Okay. And I know that goes against
every promise I made to you, and I understand
if you're pissed. I'd love to claim
 the vote for Sol as purely this mastermind strategic plan,
but that's not entirely true. I could not fathom
 writing Aysha's name down because of
 my emotional bond with her. You know, this isn't a moment where I'm like, "Yes,
we just nailed a blindside." It's a moment where I am upset. I-I think that's gonna haunt me. I think that's gonna be, like... This is a game. And if the people playing
the game can't handle that, that's on them. It's not on you. -Okay?
-I know, but, like, am I the person
who can't handle it is really... You're gonna be able to... I wanted to come out here
and be this villainous mastermind player
who was able to make decisions based purely off
how I could advance in the game. But at the same time,
 I know myself. I'm sensitive. And that's something that
I just have to learn to balance as I move forward in this game. No. That's why I was very-- I was,
like, I thought it was you. ROME:
I feel like
we all played that perfectly. And now we have
the majority alliance. We got a solidified alliance. Like, we're,
we're ready to roll. (chuckles) Tonight, Tribal Council went
exactly how I wanted it to go. Aysha went home. -Sol messed up,

Yeah. Which, like... GENEVIEVE:
Oh, my God. Yeah. This Survivor game is going perfectly for me

 Freestyling,
 going with the flow is kind of
 how I'm playing Survivor. And right now Sierra is my number one. The two of us
 are sitting in the middle. So if we go to Tribal Council, we can stick
 with Anika and Rachel or pick up Andy,

my whole game. When Anika
 came back from the journey, she said
the other tribes are picking up that Sam and I
are working together. We're not dating,
but we are working together. And what
is giving them that vibe? I'm not sure. You've spent so much alone time

why is it that we're dating?

dating Ani or Rachel?
-Ani says it's aesthetic. -She said,
it's Ken and Barbie, and...
-Ken and Barbie? Get out of here. Whatever. I'm not even
 gonna let it get in my head. But I think, moving forward in the game,
I don't want them to know that Sam and I
 are this tight alliance. So I'm gonna make sure
 Anika and Rachel know that I want to work with them and make sure
that line is, like, clear. (chuckles) Oh, are we alone? -Yeah.

-SUE: You did? Yep. Once you accept
that it's part of the process, it's a little bit easier
to let out. Before I even
 came into this game, my number one target for an ally
was gonna be an older woman,
 preferably a mother. I wanted to play with a Sue, and the island fortune
brought me a Sue. -Feeling a little better?

 is looking for idols. No. ROME:
 Sol is looking hard
 for this idol, and that is very scary. We want to make sure that, no matter what, Sol cannot find this idol.
Anyone but Sol. Anyone but Sol. If you're gonna
keep looking for one, that's... Yeah, that's more
of a threat than someone just sitting back at camp

 to do that. I'm just saying,
there's a time to do it and there's a time not to. And, like,
the people at the top, they kind of have
that freedom to do it. But, like, I don't know
why you would just increase the target on your back. SOL:

he hasn't. Sol and Rome
 are on opposite planets, and that is a positive for me. I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos, which is why I've been pushing
 for them to continue clashing, so they will not work
 with each other. I think my strength
 is getting to know people, really understanding them, and then being able
to beautifully manipulate them. I've never been

 It is about as awkward
 as awkward can be. I know that Rome is just trying
 to protect our four, but, like,
 he just plays the game at an intensity level
that is not a match with my own. He's not looking
for anything right now. And he's devoid
 of any sort of concept of what Sol might be feeling as one, a player, and two, you know, a grown man, a human being on this Earth. It's just a lot. So much. Oh, I'm sorry, Sol. It's all good. That's really not how I,
personally, want to play. -You're not out.

relationship and are very close, but it's also
 a complicated relationship for me to navigate because he's such a big personality

fluid enough, you know?

calling us the Breadwinners.

that's not where I'm going. -You know I have to play it off.

you tell me that stuff? SIERRA:
 I didn't say, "Hey, girls, let's
be called the Breadwinners." I didn't come up with that. I'm going along with it because I'm doing what
 I think is best for my game. Andy, right now, is... He-he scares me. I don't... Why? I don't think
Andy's gonna be loyal to me. But we don't
have to go with Andy yet. If-if we're at four, we can
always go with one of the girls. I don't know if that's
what makes sense for me either. SAM:
 Sierra thinks Andy needs to go at the next
Tribal Council, and, uh, that ain't gonna work for me. Keeping Andy is absolutely essential to my game. I don't see a world
where it's the four of us, and the two of them
aren't wanting to get me out. Yeah, but that's not
gonna happen because of me. Sam and I are just completely
 bumping heads right now. We might need Survivor's alliance therapy at this point because we're just going

-You're gonna find two sandbags and the pieces you need
to make this window frame -that you're gonna
throw the sandbags through.
-SUE: Good job, Kyle. -TIYANA: Great job.
-PROBST: Kyle has
his pieces free. Starts building the frame. Sol has his pieces free. That's the top. -TIYANA: That goes on top.
-SUE: Go, Kyle. Kyle can start for Tuku
with his first toss. GABE:
All right,
take your time, brother. Take your time. PROBST:
On and off. Another toss. Just misses. ANIKA:
There you go, Sam. PROBST:
Sam has all the pieces. He can start building the frame. -(whooping)
-Kyle tosses. No good. Kyle,
that sandbag will not count. It's got to be a clean toss. TEENY:
You got it, Sol. -Yeah!
-PROBST: Sol with the first one. -(cheering)
-Sol with two in a row... -This now, right?
-...for Lavo. Wow! SOL:
All right, pull the corners. PROBST:
Two tosses. Sol landed 'em both. -You're made for this, Sam.
-PROBST: Here goes Sam. -Sam sticks one.
-Nice. There we go, Sam. -PROBST: Kyle sticks one.
-(cheering) -(overlapping chatter)
-Sol gave Lavo a big lead. Sam, you're good.
Let's go, Gata. -You're good, Kyle.
-ANIKA: Beautiful. PROBST:
Let's go, Tuku. TIYANA
Sandbags, sandbags, sandbags. Everybody working
on the sandbags now. -You got to get all
the sandbags to your platform.
-(grunting) They are very heavy. CAROLINE:
They are very heavy. PROBST:
You cannot start digging
until you have all your sandbags on your platform. Lavo, you're good.
Start digging. SOL:
Let's go, guys. Come on. -(grunts loudly)
-CAROLINE: We're good. -Jeff?
-You're good. You're good. -Dig.
-SAM: Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go. Now all three tribes
are in this. -Two hands.
-PROBST: Now everybody's
digging. TIYANA:
Two hands. KISHAN:
Oh, I feel something.
Feel it. -Yeah. Good job.
-Nice. Let's go, baby. PROBST:
Lavo has their key. Gata has their key. -Tuku has their key.
-Pull it! ANDY:
Pull it, pull it, pull it. We are dead even right now... Oh, there's multiple keys? ...as we head into the final
stage of this challenge. SOL:
Unlock it. Unlock it. Unlock it. Yeah. You're good, Lavo.
Lavo's through. They can start
working on the puzzle. -Gabe has it for Tuku.
-Yeah, go. PROBST:
You can work on your puzzle,
Tuku. Gata's through.
You can work on your puzzle. -TIYANA: Okay, babe.
-KYLE: All right,
here we go, baby. -PROBST: It's gonna be
Caroline and Gabe for Tuku.
-SUE: Let's go, guys. PROBST:
Rome and Genevieve for Lavo. Anika and Rachel for Gata. GENEVIEVE:
Okay. PROBST:
Day eight.
You want to get to day nine. -It's right here.
-CAROLINE: Oh, yeah, it is.
Yeah, it is. PROBST:
Caroline gets
the first piece for Tuku. -SIERRA: Nice.
Way to go, Rachel.
-Yes. And Rachel with the first piece
for Gata. -Rome's trying
to get the first piece.
-Right hand! He's taking the throne position. -He will be handed pieces
by Genevieve.
-CAROLINE: I got this one. Got it. SUE:
Yeah, Caroline! -You got it?
-PROBST: It is Gata and Tuku -moving quickly.
-Yes. Good job, Ani. -CAROLINE: Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
-Move. PROBST:
Rome still looking
for that first piece for Lavo. It's either gonna be that
or something similar to that on the left side. PROBST:
That first piece gives you
an idea of how these pieces go together. Once you get it,
it gets a little easier. TIYANA:
Great job, Caroline. Not... That is not it,
either side. PROBST:
Once again on the puzzle,
it is Tuku and Gata in a showdown. -Thataway, Rach.
-PROBST: It is Gata in the lead. -I got it.
-PROBST: Then Tuku.
-TIYANA: Beautiful, Caroline. PROBST:
And then dead last, without a single spark
of flame, it is Lavo. GENEVIEVE:
We just need our first piece. SOL:
Nope, not it, Rome. -ANDY: There you go, girls.
-SAM: Great job, girls. PROBST: Gata continues
to expand on their lead. Gata looking very good
right now. -Got it.
-PROBST: Another piece for Tuku. TIYANA:
Yes, Gabe. -PROBST: Same story at Lavo.
-Not it, Rome. PROBST:
Now you start
to question, "What is wrong?" -SOL: Not it, Rome.
PROBST: Why can I not
get a piece to fit? SOL:
That is not the piece, Rome. Not even one piece. -That's not it.
-That's not it. PROBST:
Meanwhile, Rachel and Anika
making it look easy. You're doing so amazingly well. PROBST:
Like assassins, piece by piece,
one after the other. -Caroline
with another piece for Tuku.
-Great job, Caroline. You guys want to switch roles? SAM:
There you go, girls. -Way to go, guys. You killed it.
-Finish it off. Gata down to their last piece. -PROBST: That is it.
What a calm finish.
-Great job. Gata wins immunity
and the chickens for reward. -We got chickens.
-PROBST: We're now
looking for one more. Very similar
to the last challenge where Lavo was struggling to get
anything going on the puzzle. That's not it, Rome. Rome's plopped in front
of the puzzle and has made no progress
with Genevieve. Come on, Jeff. One after another,
trying every piece. Nothing is sticking.
No changes made. No assessment,
reassessment, nothing. Tuku getting closer. Oh, my God. Kill me now. PROBST:
Gabe leaving Caroline
to finish it for Tuku. Oh, my God. PROBST:
Lavo just gonna watch? There it is.
Tuku wins immunity and six eggs, sending Lavo back to Tribal Council for the second straight time, where somebody will be
the fourth person voted out of Survivor 47. PROBST:
A rare, rare visual. A puzzle that ended
the same way it started, as if it never happened. All right, Gata,
another convincing victory. -(whooping)
-SUE: Good job, guys. -Good job.
-PROBST: Once again,
immunity is yours. Nobody going home,
no Tribal Council tonight. In addition,
waiting for you back at camp-- three egg-laying hens. Well done.
Tuku also finished. -(whooping)
-Wins immunity. Once again, safe from the vote. Waiting for you back at camp-- six eggs from those three
egg-laying hens. All right,
before I send you off, we have a journey. Gata, you're in charge. You're gonna send somebody
from each tribe. It cannot be somebody
who's already been on a journey. So first take a moment and tell
us who's going from your tribe. -(indistinct chatter)
-It's gonna be Andy. All right, now,
who's gonna join Andy from Lavo? Teeny. All right, Andy,
who's gonna join you from Tuku? -We're gonna pick Caroline.
-PROBST: Caroline. -All right.
-PROBST: Okay, Andy, Teeny, Caroline,
grab your stuff, head out. You will return back
to your camp -in time for Tribal Council.
-Bye, guys. (overlapping chatter) -ROME: Good luck. Good luck.
-PROBST: All right, Gata, Tuku, grab your stuff,
head back to camp. No Tribal Council tonight.
Nobody going home. Yes, sir. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
All right, Lavo,
let's first just talk. Rome and Genevieve,
describe that frustration because it's very different
when you're out here. I've never tried to do a puzzle
under these conditions -and with that pressure.
-ROME: So, you know, the two times I've been
at the end of a challenge, I've been able to clutch it up. So I felt confident
that I would be able to, you know,
potentially do this. And then, you know,
your family's gonna be seeing you try to do a puzzle and not be able
to get one piece, and it's just...
it's just really embarrassing. PROBST:
All right, Lavo, Tribal Council tonight,
where somebody will be the fourth person
voted out of Survivor 47. As a penalty for losing,
I will keep your flint. You'll have a chance to earn it
back at the next challenge. All right, head out. See you
tonight at Tribal Council. GENEVIEVE:
 Losing today's challenge and the way
we lost it really sucked. While the other tribes
 might be enjoying chickens and having scrambled eggs,
 we've got Tribal Council, and we are going to be having
 a straight-up scramble to see who goes home, so... not great. Not great. Ah, it's so easy
when you're sitting at home, but when you're out here
in Fiji, it is a whole different game. Think you could solve this

Look, we have an egg in there! (Anika gasps) SIERRA:
Hello, are you the animals? RACHEL: The idea of eating,
 like, some juicy, hot chicken right now
just makes me want to just die in a pool of drool. But there are politics involved
 in whether to kill
or not kill the chickens. We do have to feed them
to keep 'em strong. Is anybody opposed
to just eating them? They can eat grass. So I kind of...
I-I... I don't know. ANIKA:
I want eggs. I'd rather keep getting meals
out of them. -I think so, too.
-Yeah.
-And that's protein. SAM:
I do want to eat one
at one point. (laughs)
There's a lot of meat there. SIERRA:
 I cannot kill the chickens.
Like, I can't do this. Chickens are near and dear
 to my heart. We go to wineries
 that have chickens. I feed them,
I hold them, I pet them. I love chickens. -(clucking)
-Oh! -Oh, my God.
-Sounds like he's got to go. SIERRA:
No. SAM:
 My first thought when we win is, "Thank you! Some food, some protein." But Sierra doesn't want
 to kill the chickens. She wants to just wait around
 and hope that there's gonna be dozens and dozens of eggs
that hatch. -SIERRA: Sam!
-What? SIERRA:
The chicken's out! Grab the chicken! SAM:
 I'm eight days without food. I don't care anymore.
Just give me the green light, and that chicken, uh, will... You know,
it's going to the butcher shop. (clucking) GENEVIEVE:
Well, that was embarrassing. ROME:
That was very embarrassing. -I think we just
collectively know...
-SOL: Yeah. -...we're not good...
-At puzzles. ...at those type...
those types of puzzles. ROME:
 I put myself in the final
 position to do the puzzle. I definitely want
to be the person that's in that clutch role. Yeah, not getting one piece
was demoralizing. Yeah. ROME:
 And honestly, I was just absolutely awful. All right, well,
you guys ready to go wash off? GENEVIEVE:
I don't know
if I'm gonna go in the water. It's so chilly. KISHAN: I don't think
I'm gonna go in the water. ROME: Fortunately,
 I have faith in the core four. So even though Gata chose Teeny
 to go on the journey, in our heads
 we already know the game plan. It's gonna be Sol. It's just
about how it goes down. So we all know the plan. It just sucks
that it had to happen now. I feel like
I should at this point. ROME:
 I still have the Steal a Vote
 in my pocket, so, if I feel like Sol might
 play his Shot in the Dark, guess what.
 I can use the Steal a Vote and make sure he can't play
 his Shot in the Dark, because you have to have a vote in order
to play a Shot in the Dark. I'd rather try and convince him -of another plan
and at least see how he...
-If he bites? Like, we can get a vibe
whether he believes it or not. But the thing is, I don't want
 to use this Steal a Vote, because if we, as an alliance,
 can keep this advantage, then we'll be sitting really
pretty heading into the merge. I do think
we can maybe give him a name and make him feel comfortable. Does Genevieve sound believable? 'Cause we could always push,
 like, we need tribe strength. We feel she's given the least. That's probably
the most believable. KISHAN:
 Rome proposes,
 "Let's maybe try to see "if we can comfort Sol
 in this fake plan that the vote is gonna be
 on someone else." And I was like, "Maybe. What about Genevieve? "You know,
strength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve?" Just 'cause
I do not want my name heard. It hasn't been heard yet.
I don't want it out there. ROME:
Do you think there's any way
we could convince him to give up his Shot in the Dark? Be like, "I am taking your vote
if you don't vote with us." -Yeah.
-And we can say
that it's gonna be Genevieve. Like, I could just
straight-up threaten him. I'd have no problem doing that. Yeah. That works. Anything that works. I feel actually
pretty good about that. ROME:
It might be a little villainous. You know,
I could strong-arm Sol tonight, and little does he know that he's gonna be
gone regardless. But at the end of the day,
at least I'll let him choose
how he goes out. -What?
-Just-just wait, just... I feel like if I give him that ultimatum, I feel like
he might actually break. It's more than likely
gonna be you tonight. But hear me out. I'm willing
to work with you for this vote to make it the way
that we want to. The way that we'll be able
to do it is because -I have a Steal a Vote.
-Dude. I will use this Steal a Vote
on Genevieve tonight. But the only way
that I'm doing that, -and I'm letting you
know that...
-Yeah? ...is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark. I'm letting you know,
if you don't give me your Shot in the Dark,
I'm using the Steal a Vote on you tonight, and then you can't play
your Shot in the Dark anyway. I'm letting you know that right
now, and you'll be going home. -I have the advantage...
-What are you talking about,
bro? You're, like,
threatening me right now. This isn't a threat. I'm just
letting you know the situation. -Is this real life, bro?
-This is Survivor, bro. SOL:
 I was like, "Bro, really?
 It's like, you can't be
 threatening people." But, you know, the villain
on this season is Rome. "Congratulations.
This advantage allows you "to steal a vote
from another player at Tribal Council." Blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. SOL:
 It's a slap in the face,
 'cause, uh, nobody,
especially of Rome's size, has ever talked to me
 the way he has, and I don't plan on working
 with him ever in this game. And then here's the thing.
Here's the thing. -How can I...?
-That's fine. If you don't want to do it,
that's fine. I'm using my Steal a Vote
on you tonight, and you'll be going home. I can't believe
you're doing this to me, dawg. Down to the water. -To what?
-The water. -SOL: You just threatened me.
 -ROME: That's not a threat. It's an ultimatum.
That's not a threat. -That's an ultimatum.
-Oh, okay. -An ultimatum is not a threat.
-Okay. My bad. My fault. KISHAN:
 You know, the obvious vote is,
 we vote for Sol, and then, on the other hand,
 you have Rome. His thing is, "It's my show.
You know, Lavo is Rome." And I'm starting
 to get sick of it. He's playing chaotically.
 That scares me. You know, I can trust him now.
Can I trust him in the future? -Yeah.
-Even if he steals a vote, -that's two votes on Sol.
-Yeah. Even if Teeny loses her vote,
if us two vote Rome... -And it's...
-Rome will die. He will die. -I know.
-You're...
I can see you grinning. -Bad boy. Bad boy. (laughs)
-Ooh. -Naughty, naughty.
-Naughty, naughty. KISHAN:
 I want to switch the vote
 onto Rome because I think
 the true benefit of this is Rome is super tight
with Genevieve. Once Rome's gone,
 that leaves Genevieve in a really vulnerable position. Okay. Dude, I'm ready
to go to Tribal now. KISHAN:
 If we get out Rome, and
 we let Sol in, into the plan, Sol now trusts me because I have created the plan
to save him. He is going
to be completely shocked. If this happens,
this will feel so... good. Okay. -It's going to happen.
-Okay. Yeah. This is one of the best feelings
 in the world. Rome is the vote. He's going to have no clue.
 I'm so happy. (laughing) At tonight's Tribal, Rome will burn. ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Kia.

-Interesting. Like, they are
kind of like an ego battle. So I feel like
it would be one of them tonight. -Those are my guesses...
-ANDY: Okay. Okay. -...based on last time.
-CAROLINE: Again, I get really good vibes

felt so far. Yeah.
-Yeah. No matter what,
good luck, you all. -No hard feelings whatsoever.
-Okay. Okay. I feel like I'm next. -Yeah.
-Would you volunteer? Ours is looking
really, really shaky, genuinely, about
where the pieces are going. I mean, obviously,
I'm going tonight, right? ANDY:
Yes. Yes. Is-is there a consensus,
though-- Rome versus Sol? No, but I feel like
I do kind of trust the people I'm working with,
but, like, you guys do have to understand,
like, I'm going, -and neither of you are going.
-Understood. TEENY:
 Neither of them are budging. My next Tribal Council is-is... is now. You know,
I don't have much time to waste. Like, you guys
at least have some time. I don't want to lose my vote. -I think... I'm sorry.
-I think I have to think
about it. -We don't have much time.
-Let me just... Can I just think real quick
about, like, -the numbers real quick?
-Please.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. CAROLINE:
 I'm getting so nervous. If no one volunteers
to give up their vote, all three of us lose our vote
 at the next Tribal. It's the very,
 very worst-case scenario. Okay, you know what?
I'll do it. -I love you. Okay. Perfect.
-Thank you.
-I'll do it. I don't want
 to look back on this and feel like an idiot, but whether it's Rome or it's Sol going home tonight, I think
 it could work without my vote. All right, guys. ANDY:
Oh. TEENY:
 And in that moment, I felt I'm losing my vote either way. I either get something
out of it, or I don't. -Okay, I get it.
-CAROLINE: And so
it's an idol no matter what. It's an idol...
that we agree on. (gasps)
Yes. That's better. Okay, but, like, we can't use it to be funky with each other. It's different rules.
All we have to do. Like, when we use it,
it will be all in agreement, -and we'll be ready to go.
-To use as an idol. ANDY:
 Now, this is a new amulet.
 This is not like amulets we've seen in the past. The
rules are slightly different. We can use this
 to be a hidden immunity idol. But in many ways

Different type of amulet. If the three holders can agree
to play it, and it's an idol. Uh-oh. GENEVIEVE:
Yeah. So I was like,
"I'll just lose it tonight. "'Cause I'm gonna lose it
either way. -Might as well get something
out of it."
-Mm-hmm. We all got amulets. -Ooh.
-TEENY: They can only be used -when all players are

-Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Me and Genevieve
are voting Rome. KISHAN:
Yeah. TEENY:
 I definitely feel powerless
 without a vote. But I feel really lucky
to have found alliance partners who are coming up with plans
without me even being there, especially
 with my number one Kishan. I'm proud of you guys
for coming up with this... That was all Kish.
I just, like, sat here and got told the plan.
It was amazing. -Just, are you telling Sol?
-We told Sol. -You did?
-He is totally game. -So I can tell Sol, too?
-Yes. -Like, you're in.
-Yeah. -You're fully in.
-Yeah. -And I'm so happy.
-Me, too. TEENY:
 Sol is somebody
 who I want to keep. And if that means
 that we get out Rome, who is a bit of a nuisance
 around camp, who stresses us out
 in the game a little bit, then great.
It's a win-win. The plan was,
that me and Kishan came up with, was to tell Sol
that we're voting for Genevieve. Interesting.
And whose suggestion was -to throw Genevieve's name out?
-Uh, Kishan. But I get why you wouldn't...
wouldn't like that, obviously. -Yes. Yeah.
-Nobody likes
their name being... being the, you know, the decoy,
but obviously we, like... -100%. 100%.
-Yeah, we're good to go. So it wasn't, like,
a malice thing -that Kishan threw your name
out there.
-No. -Of course not.
-Like, I promise. Does Genevieve sound believable? I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos. What about Genevieve? You know,
 strength is a big issue. So what if we say Genevieve? Once Rome's gone, that leaves Genevieve
in a really vulnerable position. GENEVIEVE:
 Rome going home
 is Kishan's plan. And I am a bossy, type A woman, and I don't want to just
 be going along with plans, especially if they're not
in my best interests. Like, Rome is an asset
for me in this game. And he's ruffling
people's feathers, but not mine. He trusts me.
 He will have my back. I mean, as much
 as anyone out here will. And the biggest red flag
 for me is, Kishan doesn't hesitate to use
 my name as the decoy vote, which lets me know he's not really intimidated
 or respecting my game. So maybe it's time to stop going along
with Kishan's plan and make Kishan the plan. -What's up?
-I need to give you a heads-up, -and I need to make it quick.
-Okay. You're the plan tonight. I'm 100% serious. -So, does Teeny
know about this?
-Everyone knows about it. All these brilliant plans
are his. What do you want to do? ROME:
 That's just so wild that Kishan would
 throw that out there. Why would they want me out if they know I'm going hard
for the alliance? That's just so... The second
 that I heard Kishan might want to put my name out there,
I was a little bit hurt because I wanted to do everything
that I could to make the alliance
as strong as possible. And now, at this point, I don't feel like I can trust anyone in this game
 but Genevieve. Does Sol know about it? ROME:
 My Steal a Vote
 could be massive tonight. Maybe we could
 just get out Kishan. Or I could block him completely
 from being able to vote and put two votes on Sol. And just like that,
 Sol will be going home. I'm willing to do it
 because guess what. I already know
 the guy doesn't like me. This, uh, uh, crazy, toxic, brother-like relationship
 is a huge problem long-term. -He put Rome up to it.
-Uh-huh. And everyone is benefiting
from you two fighting. Uh-huh. There's no way
I'm not voting Rome tonight. Let's just stick... Can we
please just stick to the plan? GENEVIEVE:
 There is no way I can pull off
 a Kishan blindside without Rome and Sol,
but they're openly adversaries. And then
 Teeny doesn't have a vote, and she's really close
 with Kishan. So that's really not an option
 to me. -I know.
-Like, why? -'Cause Genevieve loves us.
-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:
 But Rome and Sol have now
 just had this big fight, almost to the point
that it's irreparable damage that can't be undone. So it is going to take a miracle to get them to work together. There's just no, no, no way. ROME:
Sol, I just want to say that, like, I know that I
probably came across way wrong, and, like, I just want you
to know that I'm... I apologize
if I came off threatening or whatever, you know,
you may think. SOL:
All right, I appreciate that. -Okay. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a game. -We need to get control.
-Right, but... -We're not gonna have it.
-...after, after... -We're not gonna have it.
-Yes, we will. I... We're not gonna have it. Could be
a million-dollar decision. Sol's like, "I don't want
 to work with Rome." Rome's like, "It's a done deal. Sol is going home tonight." And what would be best
 for my game would be to take a stealth shot at Kishan
that he wouldn't see coming. Is it bad that I'm excited? It's gonna be a wild night. The problem is, you have to be in the majority,
 you need numbers. It is not a one-person game.
Genevieve doesn't get to pick. But with so few votes, and because the Steal a Vote
 advantage exists, anything could happen, and it wouldn't take too much to turn the tide. Wa nt t o ge t th e mo st o ut of o ne s he et ? Grab Bounty. (♪♪) Bounty is made

All right. So let's start by talking
about today's challenge. Rome, I've never really seen
anything like today in the sense that you got to the puzzle
first and never got a single piece,
not one piece of the puzzle. ROME:
You know, we did great in the first part
of the challenge today. We were the first ones to get
to the puzzle, so I stepped up. I wanted to, you know,
try my hand at it. And, unfortunately,
I failed pretty miserably. PROBST:
I was surprised that you never wanted
a different perspective, like to step back
or to look at it this way. You just kept,
like a doctor taking the... Maybe Kishan can give
a better analogy, but... -(laughter)
-Scalpel. PROBST:
Like the scalpel, yeah. ROME:
Well, I don't even know if doing it differently
would have changed anything, in all honesty.
I truly feel like we're just not that great at those specific
type of puzzles. PROBST:
Okay, so you lost,
you're back here at Tribal. So, Sol, if I dropped in
on Camp Lavo this afternoon, what would I notice happening? Chaos times ten is what
you would have walked into. -Wow.
-Yeah. Look, after the challenge,
Rome announces to me that he has a Steal a Vote, which shocked the hell
out of me. And he basically said, "Since you're on the bottom,
you and I can work together. "Uh, the only way
I'll do that, though, is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark." ROME:
Listen, it's not like he didn't write my name down last Tribal Council. He did. So I told him, "The only way
that I would trust you "to work with you is if you
give me your Shot in the Dark. "But if you don't, "then I'm gonna use
my Steal a Vote on you, "and you're not gonna be able
to play your Shot in the Dark, and you're gonna
be going home tonight." Sol, given the fact
that you did vote for Rome, that's not
that unusual a request. SOL:
It's kind of smart, but at the same time, for me,
the way he went about it, that's the key.
I didn't appreciate it, and so I said,
"Are you threatening me, dude?" -Uh, what did you say?
-I said, "No. -it's an ultimatum,
not a threat."
-Right. And so, for me, it sounds
like a threat, so I said, "No, I'm not doing it." PROBST:
And, Rome, your threat about -stealing his vote is...
-Ultimatum, Jeff. -(laughter)
-The ultimatum about stealing his vote is
that you have to have a vote in order
to play the Shot in the Dark. ROME:
Precisely. And I just want to say, Jeff, I, in the moment, thought that that was
the right thing to do, but the way that I did it and
the way that I approached Sol was just not respectful. Everyone that knows me
in real life knows I'm a super genuine person. So I went to him today,
and I apologized, and I think
that he does understand that that's...
that's just not who I am. PROBST:
Kishan,
what's your take on this? Because
when there's only five of you, it doesn't take much
to vote somebody out. An argument can do it. You know, we're spending
24 hours a day with each other. I think
when you're so deprived of food, you can't sleep at night, there are parts
of people's personalities that are gonna come out
that bother you, that irk you. But I think if you let
an argument guide your vote, that's letting emotions get
to you. I think
when you're playing this game, you have to be more strategic
than that. -PROBST: Teeny,
how about for you?
-From my vantage point as somebody who wasn't involved
in the fight and also from my vantage point
as someone who did lose their vote
on a journey today, all I could really do
is put trust in the people that I had
worked with last Tribal Council and hope that it goes well. PROBST:
Genevieve,
what do you make about this? Because it sounds like there could be two people
that aren't voting. Teeny lost her vote, Rome is threatening
to steal somebody else's vote. That means
it could be four total votes, but just three people. Yeah. It means... those three people
have a lot of power. And you better hope those three
people are working with you and have your back, because they're gonna rule the day
today. KISHAN:
Jeff, I don't think at the end of the day
it changes much because it comes down to trust. You trust the conversations
you had. You trust a plan
that you've set forward. It doesn't matter
because you trust -what the plan is in place.
-PROBST: So, Sol, that can't make you feel great. Nope. Not great at all, and, um, I'm just begging Rome, bro, maybe not steal my vote? I do have
my Shot in the Dark here. If my vote is not gone,
I am playing it. PROBST:
And, Rome, what's interesting
about this is, that's a real person... -Yeah.
-I am a very real person... -PROBST: ...saying to you...
-...in the flesh behind you. -Yeah.
-...that, "I'm already
in trouble, I think. And now you're taking
the only protection I have," which is the only move to make
if you want to take out Sol. But Sol's pleading with you, "Give me a shot." ROME:
At the end of the day,
it's going to be my decision whether or not I, uh, I take this guy's vote
or not, and, you know, I just got to trust
the people that I trust, and the people that I don't
trust, I'm not gonna trust you, and I'm going
to do everything I can to get you out of this game. Wow. Ooh. (laughs) -Spooky, scary, right?
-Yeah. Is that the kind of laugh
you give when you're watching Survivor at home, Genevieve? When I'm watching Tribal, and it gets like this,
and you're like, "Oh, my God. Ooh,
something's happening." Like... So from all this chaos, where do you sit right now as
we are moments away from voting? So, chaos times ten can be great
as long as you're not in it. But honestly,
if I'm wrong tonight, it's over for me. So I think that this vote is critical to the future success
of my game. ♪ ♪ All right, it is time to vote. ROME:
You know, Jeff, I, uh... I trust the people
that I trust, like I said, and I don't trust the people
that I don't trust. So I got a Steal a Vote, and I'm gonna be stealing
Kishan's vote tonight. PROBST:
All right,
this is a Steal a Vote. Rome, you are
taking Kishan's vote, which means, Kishan,
you will not vote tonight. Rome, when you go up,
you will vote twice. All right, it is time to vote.
Genevieve, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'm absolutely freaking out. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol, and you want to play it,
