(whooping and cheering) (chanting): Merge! Merge! Merge!
Merge! Merge! Merge! PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... There it is-- a full-blown idol that nobody... knows about. Q:
 For the plus-one alliance,
 I pulled in Tiff, Hunter pulled in Tevin,
 Tim pulled in Maria. So the journey six is what I want to try
 to make sure is intact. KENZIE:
 Right now, as it stands, there's five on Siga,
 five on Nami. But there's three of us
right in the middle. Three of us Yanu. Soda hates Venus.
It's a mess. Q:
 Nami has cracks,
 so it might be wiser for us to side with Nami and vote out Mo. I'm unsure about Mo. TIFFANY:
 Oh, my God.
 All I know is that I'm glad I'm safe tonight
 because, baby, it's about to get messy. First vote: Venus. Sixth person voted out
of Survivor 46: Moriah.
That's six. That's enough. The tribe has spoken. Congrats on the first Tribal
for some of y'all. -Wasn't that intense?
That was...
-It was bad. -That was really intense.
-BEN: Whoa. That was really, like, bad. VENUS:
 My first Tribal was mind-blowing. Seeing my name written down
on a piece of parchment as the very first vote--
it was just terrible. But the fact that there was just
 only one vote with my name and the rest was straight Mo-- I automatically knew that Soda
 wrote my name down because that's the only thing
that could possibly make sense. Oh... Sure. Our relationship has been
a question mark for a while now. I really wish
I could have worked with her, but I'm also not stupid. I know that I'm loyal, but the way that you were being
evasive with your answers... That's why I... that's why I came to you the way
that I did, because it's alarming to me that you,
like, went straight for me in the attitude
that you did, though. I'll be straight up with you. I needed a moment
'cause I know I snapped. No, that's fine
that you needed a moment, but you did snap
at the same time. Like, it is fine
that you needed a moment. I didn't want to raise my voice. No, but you still were, like,
"You voted for me." TEVIN: Watching Soda and Venus is kind of the hottest tea
of the night. I told Soda I don't trust Venus,
I don't trust where she stands, I don't trust her loyalty, and I think that she'll flip
 any second that she gets. Soda hasn't listened to me,
 and now they are digging
their own graves and showing the people how toxic and dangerous they are
to the game. And I hope that they continue
 to do that because it will slide them closer to
that snuffer and keep me closer to that million dollars. CHARLIE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. If you want to chat one-on-one,
or, like, I can explain now. -VENUS: We can talk
in the morning.
-CHARLIE: Okay. Yeah. Q:
 Charlie put a vote
 on Venus anonymously. So, for Venus to come back
and to now think that Soda wrote her name down was gonna be the perfect plan. I need Nami to be in panic mode. But Charlie lets his emotions
 get the best of him, and he confesses to Venus that he is the one that wrote her name down. In this game, we cannot have that going on. And I think he needed to be put in his place. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, man.
You are right. I messed up here.
I messed up here. -I'm with you.
-You know what I told you? -Yeah.
-Do not let your emotions -get you in this game.
-Yeah. You don't have to admit ...
to nobody. You're right. You're right. Q's real mad at me for telling Venus
that I voted for her. And in this moment,
 I'm just saying, "I'm sorry," and just letting him know
 that we're solid. But what I'm thinking is, Q is running this show, and no one is allowed
 to have any other ideas. "We're doing this,
 we're locking it down, "we're getting to the end, we're doing it Q's way
 or it's the highway." So... I need to get Q
out of the game. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (Ben gasps) (panting rapidly) (gasps) -Ben, is that you?

 I understood how nuts it was
 in the moment, 'cause I've had
 panic attacks before. It's, like, something
 I can't control. Thank God there were
some nice people in the tribe, and Kenzie was able
 to just calm me down. KENZIE:
 My mom and sister
 both struggle with anxiety. They struggle
 with their mental health. So, I've been helping people
 regulate sleep and anxiety before I even knew
 what that was, really. KENZIE:
 You know, this is a game where I very easily could have
been like, "Good, don't sleep. I hope you mess up
in the challenges." But that...
I couldn't. I couldn't. BEN:
 Kenzie held my hand,
 helped me make a fire, and she made me feel like
 it wasn't gonna be some kind of, like,
"Yo, Ben's being a freak show," back to, like,

will have individual immunity -at tonight's Tribal Council.

you are safe. -Head back.
-Thank you. -Maria, come on over.

is a hug from you. -Oh, well, I...
we can get a hug.

so, Kenzie, you're safe tonight. -Yep.
-The six of you will go

the person voted out will not make the jury. One last thing. You're not going back to camp. You're going back
to the old Siga camp. All right, swim out. See you
tonight at Tribal Council. All right, see you later, Jeff. HUNTER:

 that's chopped off right before
 they make it to the jury, and I am the odd man out. So I need to play my idol

 Winning this means everything. Maria, my girl-- she really
 pulled it out for us, and she basically gave us
a second life in this game. Like, we were given a feast that is gonna energize
 us for future challenges. But even more than that,
 she basically guaranteed that we're all at least
 gonna make the jury, which is huge, you know, and, you know, coming in,
it seems obvious. You know, there's four Nami,
 there's two Siga-- Charlie and Maria. And Maria has
 the immunity necklace. Who's the obvious vote? Charlie, my guy who put my name down
the last vote is unfortunately up on the chopping block. Oh, my God. TEVIN:
Can we cheers? We are all
at least on the jury. We will be... (cheering) TEVIN:
 From the outside looking in, you would automatically think,
 "Oh, there's four Nami, there's two Siga, Maria's safe." So, I think
that people would assume that Charlie would be
the one going home because he's not in the numbers. However,
 Maria and I know different. We understand
 that there is another game being played
 that is across tribal lines. So we see that it's not
Nami versus Siga here. And so, tonight is the night
that I want to make a big move. I want to be the curator of the
first blindside of the season. Poor Hunter is all alone

to do super well in challenges. Like, of course I'm gonna give
it my all. I'm not a quitter. But it's such an accomplishment that I didn't think I would get
 to check off my bucket list. Yanu started so bad.
Like, I never thought I was even gonna
get this opportunity. And now, I just feel like
I'm, like... really gaining some footing
in this game. It's just a really,
 really good feeling. Soda and Q she needs
to land a talk show after this. That was so funny. KENZIE: You were just out there
having a good time today. Q:
So far in this game, I have yet
 to really show my ability. That was by design.
 I didn't want a target on me. So in today's challenge, I jumped off on purpose to see if my alliance
 was really strong. So I wanted to go
 into this first immunity not immune at all. Oh, my goodness. -Hunter's Nami, though.
Is he not?
-Yeah. TIM:
This is like a Christmas present that we have to open. It is a gift-wrapped opportunity because Hunter is alone. Yes, we've made agreements
 with Hunter, but it's not about the alliance. Hunter's a beast
 in challenges, and now that we have him pinned,
let's take him out. He's part of the six. Are you gonna beat him
in an individual immunity? Me? I can. Yeah. That's okay.
Ain't nobody in this game gonna ever win ten
individual immunities. Nobody. Tim feel like Hunter is the most physical threat here, which-- debatable, but I would rather go against a physical threat than one that somewhat has some skills off the gridiron competing. All right. Because I committed
to the six thing with you, Maria, him, Tevin and Tiff. The point is Nami. Nami got the most numbers. Nami was the target. So after today, once again,
Nami's gonna outweigh everybody, and they can control anything. Q:
 Tim right now is trying
to position himself in this game to get to the end
in multiple ways. He wants to have
the plus-one alliance, but he also wants
to have his Siga alliance. He also wants to have
 his sub-alliance with Ben. Which is it, Tim? Which game are you playing?

 I'm hoping I'm gonna catch some eyes, you know, that someone's gonna
look at me and just go... But I'm just losing it. Calm on the outside,
 but losing it on the inside. I want someone to get up
so I can go talk right away. SODA (with British accent):
Charlie. (regular accent):
I mean, there's literally
four Nami and two Siga, -and you're the only other Siga
that can be voted.
-Oh. SODA:
 Anyone from the outside
 looking in would say Charlie is the easy vote
 tonight. Charlie's literally
the only person we can vote for if we want to be "Nami strong." But I don't want that to happen
 because Charlie's somebody who I feel is very loyal
 and likes me and just wants to work with me. I'd rather have that than Venus, because over these
 past few days, she's been, like,
 sus about me because I haven't been doing
 one-on-one strategy with her. And then last night,
 after Tribal, she came for me and said,
I wrote her name down. That tells me
you don't trust me. It's four Nami and one you. -Yeah.
-I'm not gonna vote that way. And I'm gonna talk to Tevin. So we have to really,
really make it... No, I get it. I understand. I'm nervous, but I trust you. -I got you. I got you, Charlie.
You're okay.
-Soda. SODA:
 We are not gonna go
 with the majority. That's the story,
is that it's gonna be Charlie because of the numbers, but
we're really going after Venus. I told Charlie,
I just talked to him because I really love Charlie. I don't know
who your vibe with. He... And Maria, too.
Let's... let me tell you. He's loyal, and he loves us,
and I have him. Like, we're very tight. But
I think we should go for Venus tonight. I think
it has to happen tonight. TEVIN:
 Soda's right.
 Venus has been shifty. She is flopping, she's flipping, and she is
potentially threatening to the alliances
that I've already built. -We're-we're on the same team.
-Okay. We're always on the same page--
you and I. Always. We don't even need
to have long chats. TEVIN:
 But to be honest,
 Soda and I's relationship has been a little bit
 distant because she talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk. Like Yam Yam say, "You talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk." She talks, and she's good at making every single person
 feel comfortable. And for that reason,
 I can't necessarily read her. That's why I have kind of
separated myself from Soda, alliance-wise. And so the time has come. Try to make a big move, because
 now is the time to start really, really building résumé, because we're heading
to the end of the game. The plan is
to make V feel comfortable so don't play
her Shot in the Dark. And we vote V out and tell her that the plan
is to vote Charlie. That's an option. The other option is... it could be a blindside tonight
against Soda. Because V is the one
that thinks she's going. Right. Right. I believe the Survivor gods are smiling upon me. And honestly,
I've been waiting to lose. I've been wanting Soda out so bad. She is my number one target. She's a big threat in this game. Oh. Sure, we have a connection because we're Nami, but I don't care about Nami strong. Soda has to go. I know what kind of game
Venus is playing, and everyone is all
on board with, like... Venus is snaking, but we also have a chance
to get out Soda, and she doesn't expect it. I just don't know what kind of game
Soda's playing. So your proposition is -that we all vote Soda?
-Soda. TEVIN:
 I trust Maria. She's in the plus-one alliance. I trust her.
I-I know she's there for me. Oh, you just sit there
and let people come to you. Your turn with the Tev? TEVIN:
 My gut tells me
 that I can trust Charlie. Charlie's very loyal and sweet and nice
and he wants to work with me. You ain't going nowhere tonight. So, you, me, Liz and Maria
vote Soda. Okay. And then we tell Soda we're all voting Venus,
which she wants to do anyway. -Okay.
-Then you're still safe. CHARLIE:
 When we got back to camp, I was scared out of my mind. And now I've heard Venus
and I've heard Soda already, and I'm thinking,
 "What is going on on this beach?" I don't like it when I'm not
included in conversations. It's obvious
 we should vote for Charlie. But for me, I now have the clarity to realize that that's not the only way
in this game. Yes, Charlie
 seems like the easy vote, but I'm not here
 to do easy votes. I'm here to play a hard game.
And, sure, playing with fire could come back
and bite me in the ass, but I want to play with fire. I want to make big moves. I want to make
a name for myself here and show people that I'm
not someone to mess around with. What are you thinking
in terms of threat level -between Soda and Tevin?
-I have no idea. Honestly, like,
I can't tell you, at this point. But if I were to say,
"Hey, let's throw it on Tevin," 'cause I just personally
see him as a bigger threat -Right.
-socially and physically. MARIA:
 Poor Venus. Venus is trying really hard to get some footing
 in this game, but Venus is pretty oblivious. She's not
 reading the room very well. She threw out Tevin's name,
and so I think that's a mistake. Tevin and I are part
of an alliance of six. And in my perspective,
Tevin was never an option. -No committing.
-No committing. I don't want to, like,
make you say, "Well, oh, gosh, she told me this and then,
like, she turned on me." Like, not committing. -I want to talk
to everybody again.
-Ah, so, as in, -you may want
to work with Tevin instead?
-No, no, no. I want to talk. VENUS:
 Maria's hard to read. And I'm providing her
 with a really good opportunity and she was unsure
 of even working with me. So I don't know
 why she's wary of me, but, realistically, she's
putting her Siga numbers at risk by not trusting me. So I just
 need to talk to Charlie and hope that
 I can pull something out. And I am, like, stressing. I really don't care
that you wrote my name down, and I could see myself
potentially working with you. 'Cause I'm gonna
be real with you. -I would rather you stay here.
-Okay. I don't know if you've noticed
how close Tevin and Soda are. CHARLIE:
Yeah, I've seen it. The most important thing
right now -is to break the two of them up.
-Okay. I'm impartial to which one.
I have two suggestions. The option's vote Soda,
and we blindside her tonight. -Okay.
-Option two
is if I tell Liz "Soda," Soda and Tevin think it's you, -and then me, you,
Maria vote Tevin.
-Like, a three... -Yeah. Like a three,
two, one. Yeah.
-Three, two, one. CHARLIE:
 Venus says, "Number one,
we could vote out Soda." Then she's got this plan where she wants
 to do a blindside on Tevin. -I'm gonna go off.
-Okay. Um, and we need to connect
at least one more time, -'cause things change
so-so quickly.
-Yeah. It's becoming clear to me that the cracks on Nami
 are more like oceans between continents. You know, they are ready

-Ah. I'm open to working,
but, like, don't pressure me. And when I say I'm gonna
do something, I'm doing it. Venus just kind of came at me,
 and I'm like, "Listen, you're 20. Like,
 I've been there, done that." And so I was really put off
by her demeanor. And, honestly,
 I don't trust Venus. She's conniving. She's sneaky. She is dangerous. I don't know. Lack of s... Like, I'm putting, like...
We're putting a lot on the line. So, like, this lack
of certainty, if anything, it's kind of, like, scaring me
off on the idea as a whole. Maria said that
 she felt like I was telling her what to do,
 which, honestly, like, I feel like that's her ego
getting in the way of the game. I wasn't trying to pressure
you into an idea. 'Cause at the end
of the day, it's your game. -You can do whatever you want.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what? I'm gonna go. VENUS:
 She's probably used to calling
the shots and doesn't like being told what to do by someone she
probably considers her junior. So I'm a little bit
 in panic mode. This really is a "make it or break it" moment
for me in this game. Here's where I stand.
I'm down for Soda. I thought I could
get Maria on board, but I don't know if I can. -You know what I mean?
-For Soda? -Yeah.
-So, it's abort. I mean, I-I might just have to, like, consider
playing my Shot in the Dark or something, you know? VENUS:
 I'm scared.
 Charlie could potentially play a Shot in the Dark--
in which case, if he's safe, whatever
the other name is would go home. And that name
would most likely be mine. If you're saying it's like this,
then I'm gonna be honest. I'm just gonna stick
with the Nami four, -'cause that's
just the safest thing.
-No... The only person who I'm gonna believe wholeheartedly
 right now is Maria. I want Maria
to be cool with any plans that we lock ourselves into. I'm hearing from Venus... Yeah. And then Soda wants it,
obviously, just to be Venus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -So, apparently, I'm okay.
-Yeah. CHARLIE:
 With this split that we have
 where there are two Tribal Councils, two people being voted out
in one night, Maria and I, all of a sudden-- the two Sigas
 on a tribe with four Namis-- have the power. At Tribal tonight, -are we pretending...
-For me, it's easy. I'm just gonna be like, "Listen, I'm the only Siga
who can catch votes." Tonight has transformed
 from a night where I was gonna be shaking
in my boots at Tribal Council because I thought I was
 going home to a night where I'm making, probably,
the biggest decision of my game. Everyone on the beach has been
talking about getting Venus out. Venus is totally chaotic
 and unpredictable. I don't think I can
 trust her with anything. But Soda-- extremely social player.
 She's a huge threat. So if Maria and I can come out
 of this situation down two to four in numbers
and, ultimately, make the call
 on what happens tonight, we can take control
 of this game. ♪ ♪ No, I feel good with this. So we're gonna have to split
the votes between Hunter, Ben. TIFFANY:
I think I'm all right with that. TIM:
Only because we think
the biggest threat here on this Siga camp right now is Hunter. -One, two, three...
 -TIFFANY: We just gonna
 have to do damage control when we get back to Tevin. But I think
Tevin'll be fine, though. He'll be fine. Yeah.
He's, like... -Like, he's...
-I think Tevin will be fine. -'Cause Tevin
really rocks with us, so...
-There's five... TIFFANY:
 Tim's logic is Hunter's
the biggest threat on the beach. But what I know for certain: it's not about
 Hunter being a threat. It's less about Hunter being
a threat and more about the fact that they are thirsty
to get a Nami player out because a Siga player went home last night. They're still trying
to chip away at Nami's numbers. I don't care about
chipping away at Nami's numbers, 'cause I know I could do that
easily on my own. (blows raspberry) -(whispers): Tim?
-(whispers): Yes. -TIFFANY: Yeah. Yeah.
No, first of all...
-Why? TIFFANY:
He's-he's getting real shifty. Okay. Okay. I'm good with that. TIFFANY:
My only hesitation right now is if we leave Ben in the game it's gonna be harder
to get him out, 'cause now
he's gonna be on high alert. I, personally, think that Ben
is a bigger threat than Tim. I can see through Tim. He thinks he's a good liar.
 He's not. Ben-- I think
 he's a sneakier player. He might be
 a secret agent of chaos. So in my perfect world,
Ben would go home tonight and Tim would stay. Yes. Yes. Bro. Tim got to go. HUNTER: The plan tonight
 is to get the four of us-- the three Yanu and me--
to all vote for Tim. What could go wrong
 is they're all lying to me, and the Yanu people vote me out. There's no doubt
 I'm nervous going into this, but I have an idol
 that nobody knows about, and if I have to play the idol,
then I'll just play it. And if I look crazy because no
 one voted for me, that's that. But if that's what it takes, then that's what I'll do. BEN:
 There's only, like, a couple
 options happening tonight. Obviously, my name
being one of them, right? -Yeah.
-But, um, what are you feeling? I think that we're all
open-minded, is the thing. And we also don't want Nami
to have all the numbers. It's harder to lie to a friend,
 and Ben and I have bonded. He's just, like, such
a sweet and kind, gentle person. And Ben had a panic attack
 that I was there for him for. So Ben and I have formed this,
 like, friendship. That's why this game
 is so complicated, because it's hard to figure out who I, like,
like as a person versus who
I'm gonna work with long-term. I mean, what do you and Tim
want to do-- go Hunter? BEN:
For numbers, it makes sense. The only thing
that makes sense is to try -and equalize
the entire playing field.
-Exactly. BEN:
 My biggest hope tonight is that I can convince
 the Yanu three into going Hunter,
 or else I'm screwed. That simple.
You know, like, Kenzie-- she looked hesitant,
but I don't have much to go on. I'm in a tough corner, but you can't go down
not swinging. The reason I'm talking to you,
straight up, is, like,
I know we haven't had a moment. -And I know Tim and you vibe.
-Correct. -So...
-Listen, let... -Man, you got to just
make me comfortable, bro.
-I hear you. Who are we gonna tell Hunter
we voting for-- you? I think we might have
to do a cover like that. But you cool with... We gonna tell this man
to write your name down. -Yeah.
-I write his name down. -Yeah.
-He stands his ass up, he play something,
and he wrote your name down. -Then what?
-Yeah, then I'm screwed. But that's Survivor, right?
You got to take a chance. But I'm just making sure
you aware... That my name could be... -Yeah.
-When you on the island... But what do they say
in Survivor? -No risk, no reward.
-No reward. BEN:
 Would it suck
 to be taken out tonight? Sure. But it's like gambling. If you pulled this off, I would feel high
the rest of the game. You know, in the words
 of the mighty Van Halen, "Time to go bottoms up." No, no, no. Listen. He said he's fine with
 Hunter writing his name down. And if Hunter has an idol
 or something, he plays it, he's fine with going home. So... Yeah. 100%. I don't know.
I can only go on what I read. He's not comfortable.
He's not comfortable going home. I'm not a sucker. I'm smarter
than what you think. I promise. I'm telling you,
that was a bluff. Q:
Okay. So do you want to go Tim? Dude, I just told you
what I wanted to do. I want to vote for Ben. I'm just telling you
what I'm observing. KENZIE:
 Q is the type of person where we'll have a conversation.
He'll be like, "Tim is the vote." I'm like,
"Perfect." I walk away. I come back from the water well,
and he's like, "It's Ben." And I'm like, "Q, what happened? "Like, you can't just do this. "What if we have to go to Tribal "and you don't get a second to
 tell me that the vote changed? "And why is it
you are the only one "who's deciding
the way the votes go? "Like, we're a three. We're supposed
to be working together." I would rather see Ben go. -TIFFANY: Well, that's what I've
been saying since we got here.
-And we just... And if... If the three of us
are in it together, let's take the shot at Ben. -Just so you know.
-Ben ain't playing anything now. -Yes, he is.
-Well, do you
want to go Tim, then? TIFFANY:
 The stakes are high right now, but Q keeps flip-flopping
 back and forth. Like, "All right,
we're doing this." And then you step away,
and he come back, "No, no, no. We're doing this." You can't do that.
 This is a conversation. You're not just telling us
where to place our votes. -Q is working everyone.
-He is. "So do you want Tim?" If you don't shut your ass up... He's gonna come back
and be like, "Vote me, yo. -I've decided." (laughs)
-Oh, God. I'd be like, "Okay, boy." This is not the Q show. At some point, -that ain't gonna work for us.
-Uh-uh. The way Q is approaching
 stuff right now is worrisome. However, I've got my girl Tiff. The three of us have been strong
this whole time, but the way Q is barking orders at us has Tiff and I being aware that this could go into chaos mode very quickly. The plan right now is that we'll
 vote out either Tim or Ben. Tiff and I need
 to be on the same page, so no matter what
 goes off in Q's world, Tiff and I have a foundation. So is it worrisome? Yes. ♪ ( "G oo d Fe el in g" by F lo R id a fe at . AT R) ♪ This is a hot flash. (♪♪) This is a hot flash. (♪♪) But this is a not flash. (♪♪) For moderate to severe

what was it like this afternoon with only six people
knowing Tribal was looming? First thing I noticed, a tornado had to
come through Siga's camp between the time they left
and when we got there. 'Cause it was awful.
They was living rough. But we had
to start talking plans, making this game fair, because
Yanu only has three members. Nami and Siga
still has the advantage when it comes to numbers. So if we send
the right person home, it could even those numbers out
a little more. But, Hunter, at what point
do Tribal lines disappear and it becomes, "This
is who I want to play with because I can
see my path to the end"? Yeah. It's this weird spot
where the Yanu three are in a power position,
because I'm here by myself, and there's
two Sigas over there, but the majority
falls with Yanu. I am the only person who
has not voted with any group. And so I would love
to be a Yanu member right now. So, Kenzie, Hunter's saying, "I'm willing to join Yanu three. Make it Yanu four." -(laughing)
-Yeah. Okay. Hunter's a free agent,
so that's appealing. That's a number,
but at the same time, Nami has the numbers. What way do we take it? Do we adopt one
and hope that he's... You hope he's our baby? Or do we, like, chance it that he's gonna go back
with his original family? It's-it's a toss-up. PROBST:
And so, Tim, if we stay
with this train of thought, you and Ben would be saying,
"No, no, no, take out Hunter. Let's get Nami." TIM:
Yeah, I mean,
it's an individual game, and you're not really
thinking about the alliance. You're thinking about
who's threatening. And I think Hunter has carried Nami the entire game by leading and dominating in every single challenge. Yeah, but I'm not tied
to Nami in any real way other than
I had to get them here so they wouldn't vote me out. And I'm telling you,
this Nami group is not even getting along when the Siga
group is really, really close. And it was clear at last Tribal, the four that have been working
together are still here and still trying
to work together. TIM:
I love that Hunter just loves how
Siga has been able to operate. It's like, "Siga did this" or "Siga kept a close, tight lip," but he's never had to show any allegiance to anyone. He's never sat here
and had to make a decision about one of the individuals
that sit amongst him. And I'm assuming he's saying
that's a hard thing to do, which I haven't bonded
to somebody in that way, and I'm looking to do
it tonight with these three. PROBST:
Ben, it's very clear that Siga
was trying to work on Hunter and Hunter was trying
to work on you two. I haven't heard
either of you say that you were trying
to work on each other. I mean,
I'd be lying if I hadn't heard people try
to break me and Tim up. How do you respond to that? BEN:
Well, it's like,
I try to be personal. I know this
is a game of deception, but, like,
it makes it really hard to separate the personal
from the game. And I know it might sound like an open target saying that here, but, like, you know,
I had a panic attack last night. It wasn't so much about the game as just being like, "Wow. So much
intense negativity. How am I gonna
keep a straight mind?" I don't know
which other way to say it. Kenzie woke up at 1:00 a.m.
to make sure I was doing okay. That was something human,
which is very hard in this game. -That was human.
-It... Yeah. Like, I would be there for you
no matter what. It makes me want to cry now,
'cause it's like, when do you get those moments
in this kind of game? I came into this game thinking I was gonna be on the bottom
the whole time for how I am as a human
in an individual society. I'm usually people's, like,
entertainment monkey that, like, they like
having around at a party, but don't want to get deep with.
But, like, it wasn't that case. It was a breath of fresh air
where it's like, "Wow, we've actually
made bonds that I think might go beyond this game." And then to bring it back
to what we were saying before about me and Tim, all we can do
is try and play our game. It's like,
we came and did our thing and if that's what got us
in the end, so be it. But, like,
what a beautiful ride it was. You don't get an adventure
like this or make bonds like this
very often. Sorry, I know that was a lot. It was great. Beautiful. Kenzie, if it really
is the Yanu three in charge and your choices
are Hunter, Tim or Ben, it's got to be
a bit of a Sophie's choice in terms of humans,
because they all three have made very compelling,
likable cases tonight. This is really hard for me because I wouldn't be here
without these boys. Like, they literally threw me
through the merge. Sorry. And, you know, I wouldn't be able to, like,
have won this without these boys and Tiff, obviously,
but, you know, um... And I've bonded
with all of them, deeply. So when we were all on the same
team today, I was devastated. And the fact that now
it's up to me to decide, like, which one to cut is a hard pill for me to swallow. It's tough, because, yeah,
like, I, like, held Ben's hand
last night, and, like,
I've talked to Hunter, I've talked to Tim,
I've talked to everyone here on a deep level,
and it is so human. And that's how
I make my money at home, is building human connections. So, it-it gets hard for me to separate. Jeff, I know you didn't
ask me a question, but I want to recognize, amongst all these giants, today in the challenge, the smallest person
standing amongst us won. When Yanu went 11 days without any positivity,
that girl right there-- she smiled, she cried,
she kept it together. That deserves more recognition
than we're giving. And I understand
we have to vote, I do, but I have to give credit
where credit is due. -Kenzie, you did an amazing job.
-(laughs) -Thank you.
-You did.
-All right, Kenzie! You did an amazing job. Thank you. PROBST:
So I'm getting the impression this is going to be
a tough vote tonight. It's gonna be

you read into that answer? It's a very interesting comment. I find it fitting

may pick off the other. PROBST:

Charlie wrote my name down. So if anyone here really
has to be worried, it's me. PROBST:
Maria, if you want
to try to take somebody out, six people
is a great opportunity, because there's nowhere to hide. Um, I'm gonna paint
a picture for you. -Mm.
-You're having a party. You get gussied up
and you put on, like, your favorite red necklace. And you wait
for your guests to come. (chuckles) And maybe they don't come. So no one approached you? It's not that
nobody approached me. It just didn't feel
like I had the power. It just kind of felt like,
you know, maybe they stayed for a little bit,
but not too long. I'm sorry
you got all gussied up. (laughing) Y'all, I didn't
bring my bag tonight. I am staying Nami strong. That's that. Ready to go
back to the fire and get warm. I mean, that
is a lot of confidence. Soda, is that just the luxury that comes
with having the numbers? Yeah, it's, like, the luxury
of having four Nami right now. You know, and, like,
that's the thing. That's the big steak on the plate right now. So how does that
change the dynamic for the six of you? What did you notice
in terms of behavior? We were just more like,
"I don't need to run around," which is very, very different
from yesterday. Feeling like
you have your tribe there, like, a majority of
your brain space is not worried. You could see that
in people's physical movement in their body. So, Charlie, what's it like to hear Liz say, "I didn't even bring my bag"? CHARLIE:
Not great. Um... You know,
I knew what the odds were as soon as Maria was the one
that won that immunity. And I did my best today
to just pitch myself to every single person here. And it's so hard
in the new era, because, you know, I have this
little number in my pocket. Little Shot in the Dark die. And that makes it so people will give me
a little bit to work with. But I don't know if I can
believe one word of it, 'cause they don't want this
to come out. It's a one in six shot. There are only six people here. That's still scary. I just want to say,
realistically, Jeff, I feel like I already know the
move that they're gonna play. The fact that
my name was written down not only one Tribal ago,
like, it's very clear to me that that's
gonna be their move today. And I'm just hoping that
the Survivor gods are in my favor,
and his Shot in the Dark doesn't work,
and I get to live another day. All right, then,
it is time to vote. Liz, you're up. ♪ ♪ Not tonight. Not tonight. (whispering):
There is just not any way that
 we could work together. You're way too dangerous. If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Soda. Venus.
One vote Soda, one vote Venus. Venus. Two votes Venus,
one vote Soda. Soda.
We're tied. Two votes Venus, two votes Soda. Soda. That's three votes Soda,
two votes Venus, one vote left. Eighth person voted out and the first member
of our jury: Soda. Need to bring me your torch. Wow. -It was you, wasn't it?
It was you.
-VENUS: Yeah. (both laugh) I did not see that
coming at all. You played
an amazing game, Soda. Oh, man. So fun. I love you. I love all you guys.
It's really hard. -(laughs)
-We love you, Soda. (inhales sharply) I hope you crush it, man. (cries) -Soda, the tribe has spoken.
-Oh... Time for you to go. (sniffles) CHARLIE:
Thanks, Soda. (sniffles) Oh, wow. (sniffles) Grab your torches.

 "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha." Shut up. Q:
 She broke my rule. I'm a mob boss. Never seen anything like this. PHIL KEOGHAN: Previously on The Amazing Race... Ten teams raced
 through Medellín, Colombia. DANNY:
This is incredible. Why am I crying? KEOGHAN:
 The pressure to win
 took its toll on dating couple
 Amber and Vinny. I would rather be last
than have this. KEOGHAN:
 Last place firefighters Sunny and Bizzy were puzzled
 at the Detour... "The world is smaller
than we imagine." God, why is that not it? KEOGHAN:
 ...but then staged
 an epic comeback at the Roadblock
 to pass two teams. -Yeah? Yes. Okay. Thank you,
-Ugh! thank you, thank you, thank you. -(screaming)
-You are team number eight. I thought we were done. KEOGHAN:
 Danny continued his strategy
 of working with other teams. -The museum
-Um... -is over there.
-Okay, amazing. KEOGHAN:
 Boyfriends Ricky and Cesar won their second leg in a row. -You are team number one.
-Yes!
