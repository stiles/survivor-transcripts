Welcome to the season finale
of Survivor 46. Well, it's been a fun and unpredictable season
of Survivor. We've had a lot
of strong players taken out-- including six straight
blindsides-- forming our jury. We've had five players voted
out with idols in their pocket, including
the last four in a row. That's a record. And to date, it's been 23 days
they've gone without rice. Also a record. But now we're down to five. Tonight we'll have
two immunity challenges, two Tribal Councils,
one fire-making showdown. And then our final three
will face the jury and we will crown a winner
of Survivor 46. We'll then immediately
go into the aftershow while we're still here
in beautiful Fiji and talk about it all. All right, our final five: Charlie, Maria, Ben, Liz and Kenzie. Who will be
this season's Sole Survivor and take home the check
for a million dollars? This is it. Season finale, Survivor 46. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. (laughing quietly) And behold. PROBST:
 Previously on Survivor... MARIA:
Hopefully, we get to
keep in touch -and be in each other's lives.
-Oh, my God, yeah. MARIA:
 I adore Charlie so much, but right now, -he's standing in my way. -CHARLIE: I am just so grateful to, like,
have you just in my life. I love her to death, but if I'm going to play to win, I have to vote her out. PROBST:
Maria down to her last piece. And there it is. Maria's done it.
Her third individual immunity win. BEN:
 Now everybody's trying
 to come together to take down the king and queen. -LIZ: Yeah, I love Charlie.
-Yeah. Maria thinks Liz and I
 are gonna vote Charlie. -I knew this day would come.
-KENZIE: Yeah. But we're just bamboozling
 Maria and Q. All right. Tonight is Charlie's
 night to go, and I hope I get a hug. PROBST:
If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member
of our jury: Q. ♪ ♪ The tribe has spoken. Congratulations on making it
to the final five. One of you will claim the title
of Sole Survivor and the million dollars
that goes with it. ♪ ♪ (cracking) Charlie, can we go talk? Oh, yeah, of course.
Where you want to go? MARIA:
 Oh, my God. I messed up.
I messed up tonight. I tried to take out Charlie, my closest ally. But my big move didn't pan out. And, yeah, I have to do, like, major damage control. -Yeah.
-...to tell me that
if I sat next to you at the end, I was never gonna win. They pitted me against you
and did a bait and switch and made me vote for you
so I look like an idiot, and now Q's gone. I'm, like, nauseated just trying
 to explain myself to Charlie, and I'm really worried my best friend in the game
is never gonna forgive me, and my game is done. -That threesome
-Mm-hmm. -that's up there
 is out to get us.
 -Yeah. -MARIA: They messed up
 the alliance
 -Like... -No, no.
-I trusted the most
and now it's tainted. You know what? There's no reason
to call the party off. I still want to party, okay? Because we're down
to five people, and guess what? -We just got to think
how we're gonna play this.
-Okay. CHARLIE:
 Final five by the skin of my teeth. Ooh! Maria, my number one ally, came for my throat. You know, it'd be easy for me
 to be bitter and upset, but let's be real.
If she didn't win immunity, I was planning
on doing the same thing. I'm sorry.
God, I screwed up. -God.
-What the heck, Maria? -Man.
-What the heck? I'm sorry. CHARLIE:
 Maria feels terrible,
she feels bamboozled, but it's completely fake. I know it. She came for me
and I came out on top. -(laughs)
-I totally screwed up. -Damn. -CHARLIE: But if one thing
came out of tonight, it's that I'm a big threat, and people are willing
 to write my name down. So, I have to keep every path
 open, keep every option open, to get to the end and go for the win,
go for the million. -We made final five.
-CHARLIE: Honestly, -that was a great Tribal.
-KENZIE: That was a great... And, Liz, you finally
got your wish to vote Q off. -Mm-hmm.
-BEN: You think
that was just Liz's wish? -Oh, no, I doubt that.
-And that's what's up. (laughing) Q, my darling, you got played. I'm so excited! That was honestly
a really good move, guys. Y'all are playing way harder
than I thought. Yeah, we could have
told you that, but we didn't. MARIA:
Yeah, I know. LIZ:
 Maria says she finally sees that we are
 actually playing the game. Just a face.
I don't even have words. Just a face for that. But at this point in the game, Maria has a giant target
 on her back. Q ruined my game tonight
and I fell for it. -BEN: Yeah. Damn.
-Y'all want
to let me win tomorrow? MARIA:
 I am on the bottom, and now, you know,
there's a massive target on me. Winning tomorrow is imperative. Like, this is the time
 to just, like, go for it, to fight as hard as I can,
and hopefully either win or go down fighting. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on in! Mighty fierce-looking
final five. Going back to day one, nobody would have predicted
this five. No, no. But here we are. All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge? -Yes.
-First things first, Maria. -Oh.
-For the third time,
I have to take it back. -(applause)
-One more, Jeff.
I got one more in me. PROBST:
Whoa. That was a big prediction. (laughs) All right,
for today's challenge, you're gonna race
 through a series of obstacles. Once you're through,
 you'll retrieve a rope and use it to drop a bridge. You'll then cross that bridge
 and retrieve a key, then climb to the finish,
 where you will use that key to unlock your puzzle pieces. Once you've finished
 your puzzle, it will reveal the solution
 to a combination lock. First person
 to solve their combination and bang their gong... wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final four, which means you cannot
be voted out of this game. At the very least,
you're making fire for a shot to get to three. In addition, playing for reward. -I knew it.
-Want to know
what you're playing for? -Yes.
-CHARLIE: Oh, yeah. The winner will be taken
to the sanctuary, where good things happen,
for pasta... -Oh.
-Caesar salad, -Oh. Nice. Yes.
-garlic bread, -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-macaroons, chocolate pudding, -Mm-hmm.
-wine and soda. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be
the 14th person voted out, become the seventh member
of our jury. Everybody knows this.
I got to say it. Maria, if you win
today's challenge, -you join an elite group
of four women.
-Wow. The only four women
in the history of Survivor to win four
individual immunity challenges. A lot at stake.
Draw for spots. We'll get it on! -Here we go.
-PROBST: Here we go.
-Let's do it, let's do it. All right, here we go.
For a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going
through a muddy net. -You're gonna
get covered in mud.
-LIZ: Oh, my God. -It doesn't matter.
It's day 24.
-(Charlie groaning) You want to get to day 25. Right here! Everybody struggling
through that net. Charlie's gonna be out first.
Use the water if you need it. You're gonna need your eyes
to see. Ow! -PROBST: Kenzie's through!
-Ooh! PROBST:
Maria's through. Ben is through. Now you're pulling out rope
to release that plank. The only way through
is to pull that plank out and then cross. Here comes Liz. Everybody working
on their ropes. Every second could count
in this challenge. Charlie down to his last bit. Plank's out. He's good. Maria's got her plank out.
She's good. It is Maria and Charlie at opposite ends. Here comes Kenzie. Charlie through
the next obstacle. Maria's through it. Charlie's dropped
his monkey's fist. Maria has hers.
Here comes Kenzie. Now you've got
to drop your bridge, using that ball of rope. Kenzie has hers! -Ooh. Yay!
-PROBST: She's in this. Here comes Ben. -Liz now in the tunnel.
-(grunting) Ben's got his. He's good. Maria with a nice toss.
That's gonna do it. Maria first to drop her bridge. Charlie drops his bridge. Now retrieve your key. We are neck and neck right now with Charlie and Maria. Here comes Liz. -Aah!
-PROBST: Ben a little short. Maria has her key.
She's heading up. Maria now in the lead. Charlie has his key.
He's heading up. Kenzie drops her bridge,
working on her key. Now you got to climb up and unlock those puzzle pieces. Ben and Liz still working
to drop their bridge. Liz has her bridge dropped. Ben's got it. Liz heading up. Kenzie has her key. Ben working on his key. Liz looking for her key. -Ugh!
-She forgot it. -Ugh!
-She's got to come back down
and go get it. Maria working on her puzzle.
Kenzie working. Charlie working.
Ben has his key. He's up top now,
working on his puzzle. Liz had to go all the way back. She forgot her key. Day 24, final five challenge, huge stakes. Reward is secondary. You want immunity right now. Here comes Liz
heading back up again. We're gonna have everybody
on the puzzle. Another complicated Survivor puzzle. It'll give you
all the information you need to solve that combination lock. Then you bang that gong
and you're good. Kenzie making a lot
of progress on this puzzle. Charlie getting
a little more momentum now. You cannot slow down. Do not stop digging right here. We are very close.
Kenzie and Maria. Maria with another piece. Kenzie down to six pieces. Maria at nine. Kenzie with another piece. And another. Kenzie down to four pieces left. Guaranteed spot at four. Everybody else
vulnerable tonight. Kenzie, one piece left. She's got the puzzle done. -Oh, my God.
-Now what? ♪ ♪ New twist in this challenge. You think the puzzle is the end,
but it's not. You've got to read the puzzle. Everything you need
is on the puzzle. Maria now closing in
on her puzzle. Holes in your plank? Confusion now. What is happening? PROBST:
We've never seen this before
in a challenge. Liz now running back, appears to be
going to help Kenzie. Got to go over the obstacles. Maria has her puzzle finished. Now she's working on it. Everything up in the air now. It's Kenzie trying
to figure out the combination, Maria trying
to figure out the combination. PROBST:
The puzzle contains information you need
to finish this challenge. Maria now gonna head back out. Got to go over
all the obstacles. Here comes Liz, coming back. She's carrying the plank. The only guess
is she is helping Kenzie. Maria now moving
through those rope rungs as fast as she can. Liz now here
with Kenzie's plank. Maria on her own,
trying to get her plank and get back here. They've got what they need.
Can they figure it out? PROBST:
No! PROBST:
Something got to be wrong. Here comes Maria.
She's got her plank. Kenzie and Liz working together. Maria on her own. Immunity on the line. Thirty-five. PROBST:
Kenzie has it, bangs the gong. -It is over.
-Yes! Oh, my God! -Yes!
-With the help of Liz, -Yes, yes, yes!
-Kenzie's won her second immunity challenge,
guaranteed a spot -in the final four.
-KENZIE: Oh, my God. You deserve it and more. PROBST:
Maria just a little short. KENZIE:
Maria. Good job. Wow.
Another unpredictable moment in an absolutely unpredictable season of Survivor. LIZ:
You're a badass. It takes two to beat you.
You're a badass, Maria. -KENZIE: Yeah,
you're incredible, Maria.
-LIZ: Seriously. Kenzie, come on over. -Yeah.
-For the second time
this season, -individual immunity is yours.
-Dude. -You are guaranteed a spot
in the final four.
-Yeah. It means you will never
be voted out this season. -Yeah.
-At the very least, -Kenzie!
-Go, Kenzie!
-you got a shot at making fire. Yeah, I can-I can taste it.
You know, I... (whoops) Thank you so much, Liz.
Like, Maria, you're incredible. Like, we had to team up
to beat you. Like, that just proves, like, what an amazing competitor
you are. It just made sense. When Liz saw she wasn't
gonna finish her puzzle, it was just like,
"Okay, girl, we got to go." Maria, it is one of the most
interesting facets of Survivor-- is that the better you are, the bigger the target you are. I take it as a compliment,
honestly. Like, I have exceeded
my expectations out here, and if it took two people
to beat me, then, like, it's a big compliment to me -and good for them
for teaming up.
-It is a compliment. You know, it's not over
until you snuff my torch. PROBST:
All right, so here's
what's gonna happen. You're gonna leave here,
go to the sanctuary. -CHARLIE: Wow.
-Yeah.
-You're choosing one person. Who are you gonna take with you
to the sanctuary? I'm torn because,
Liz, you helped me, but Ben's the only one
who's never seen it. -Like, what...
-I'd go with Ben. I'm allergic to pasta. -KENZIE: Oh, okay.
-Are you serious? -Yeah.
-Bennie boy. You haven't seen
the sanctuary yet. All right, so here's
what's gonna happen. You two are gonna
head out to the sanctuary. -Okay.
-You'll return back to camp
in time for Tribal Council. -Grab your stuff, head out.
-Do I get a hug? -Oh.
-Buddy hug. I love buddy hugs.
-Let's go. -Thanks, Jeff.
-Congrats. Thank you. Down the steps, hang a right.
Boat'll pick you up. -KENZIE: Thank you so much.
-BEN: Thanks, Liz. -LIZ: Have fun.
-KENZIE: Thanks. Let's go chill hard, buddy. -Let's go chill hard!
-PROBST: All right, Maria, Charlie, Liz, got nothing
for you. Grab your stuff. Head back camp. See you tonight
at Tribal Council where somebody will be the 14th person
voted out, seventh member of our jury. -See you tonight.
-Jeff.
-Thank you. LIZ: Yes, what I did
 was wild, but I'm trying
to make it to the end. And honestly,
 that's all I care about. It seems like a no-brainer
 that tonight is Maria's night. But this is Survivor. This is the final five. Anything can happen. Well, it's been one of
the most unpredictable seasons of Survivor, and honestly, it's
why I still love doing this job. Come on out.

I can't believe I won immunity. Dude. And it was, like,
the most important -and sickest
immunity of the season.
-And the po... I didn't care
which one of us won it as long as it wasn't Maria. -Damn right.
-Oh. Cheers. My dude. -To chillin' mad hard.
-To chillin' mad hard. Going into
 the immunity challenge today, there was one common goal,
and it was for Maria to not win. And Liz helped me win immunity, which I was surprised at. She is so unpredictable.
 She's like a secret assassin. This is heaven. It's a perfect day, and
I'm not getting voted out, ever. I'm here to stay, baby. Like, I'm going to final four
whether y'all like it or not. Honestly, today is,
like, amazing for me. -Like, winning...
-Because the high
is so high today. -Like...
-I know, and, like,
I get to be out here -with, like, my Survivor bestie.
-Oh, my God, it's sick. (laughs) It was so sick Kenzie picked me
 for the reward today because in this game, you hope to make alliances,
and then you make a real friend with a person like Kenzie. Like, how can you not feel grateful to shred
in a situation like this? When I go home,
I just have to catch up on all the things
I ignored for years 'cause I was too busy
trying to rock my hardest. -Gonna get my driver's license.
-Hell yeah. -That's a good place to start.
-Yeah. If you want to be an adult, -we should get
a driver's license.
-Exactly. On top of that,
 we're sitting in Fiji, overlooking one of the most
 epic landscapes of all time. It's such a vibe.
It's, like, electric, almost. What do we do when we get back?
I don't want to come in cocky and be like,
"Oh, Maria tonight," you know? Feels, like, too perfect. I would be shocked
if something crazy happened. BEN:
 I think we're all
 on the same page 'cause the enemy is so common. Maria is a whole-package threat. Multiple immunities,
decimated people's gameplay, played an epic game
 of deception. So, unless she finds an idol
 or pulls a blindside, Maria's done. MARIA:
Well, that was a fun challenge. -It was fun, Maria.
-CHARLIE: Oh, my God.
-It was fun. -I do love you, dude.
-I love you, too. You're just such
a friggin' competitor, dude. I love you, too.
Thank you for saying that. -I'm just really scared
of going home.
-Don't worry about it. -Don't worry about it.
-I still really... -I'm still really scared.
-You know what? -I'm so proud of myself. -CHARLIE: Liz going over to Kenzie to help
to take down Maria-- that says, to me,
 Liz is here to play. MARIA:
I'm gonna spend the afternoon
looking for idols. If I can find one,
I'm gonna pretend -I don't have one.
-CHARLIE: Yup. And then you and I take out
whoever we want to take out. I think, that's... I mean... After last Tribal Council, I made sure that my door
to work with Maria was open. 'Cause I didn't know
 what today would bring. So, I want to solidify Maria as my champion
if she's going home tonight, and as someone
who's gonna work with me if she finds an idol. -We just should just check
-Mm-hmm. tree mail, water well,
underneath, -and then go the back way,
-Yes. -and then go back down
to the beach.
-Okay. MARIA: It's really hard
 to come back to camp knowing that
Liz just worked against me. I'm, like, super pissed. But at the same time,
 I'm like, "Damn." Like, maybe it just takes
two people to beat me. This is cool. This feels like
it would be a good -"tied to a branch" tree.
-Mm-hmm. MARIA: My plan from here
 is to find an idol or convince somebody to work with me. MARIA:
 I think Charlie has
 forgiven me and would work with me,
 but that's not enough. We need one more person. Let's go! Let's go! MARIA:
 So, today is definitely gonna
be an uphill climb in the snow, barefoot. I've just never been one
to give up. Like, I just... It's not in me to give up. (chuckles) Hi. You coming
to keep tabs on me? No, I was just looking
to talk to you. Oh.
Here's my pitch to you. You got to know
that, like, with Ben, I've distrusted him
since day one. -That's why
we're not working together.
-Yeah. Like, the fact that
he's trying to convince you that he accidentally
wrote "Kenzie." -You wouldn't...
-I've never believed -he accidentally wrote "Kenzie."
-But that's what I'm saying. You're about to move forward
with somebody who's so deceptive,
and I'm telling you, -I'm an open book.
-Yeah. I just don't think
I can beat you. -I think I can beat Ben.
-Yeah. KENZIE:
 Maria's selling
 Ben writing my name down a couple of days ago
 wasn't an accident. She is fighting for her life right now, which I respect,
 but she's almost making her argument worse
by being so convincing. I'm like, "No,
you're even more dangerous." Her pitching Ben is foolish. There's no way any of us
 are gonna fall for that. MARIA:
I'm gonna put myself out there. -LIZ: Mm.
-Big time, 'cause I got
nothing to lose. -Yeah.
-Ben wrote Kenzie's
name down on purpose. -That was not an accident.
-Hmm. And he lied to her face, and -he's been lying to her face.
-LIZ: Wow. Ben's been playing a game
that nobody knows, and he's very charismatic. He is fully capable of pulling something out
at Final Tribal. He could come out and say,
"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. "None of you even knew -that I was doing this."
-Yeah. What if he has this,
like, rocking story? I have no idea.
That's the scary part. MARIA:
Taking Ben to the final three
is dangerous. -Yeah.
-MARIA: And I think the decision
is in your hands, really. LIZ:
Well, we would
all have to do that. I know that this is crazy, but Maria really got to me
about Ben and the unknown. If he drops a bomb or two, it might be just enough
 for him to win the game. That's terrifying. I've been so focused
 on trying to get Maria out, but is that really
 what is best for Liz? Ben, Ben, Ben. CHARLIE:
 If you told me this morning Maria goes to Liz and pitches Ben
as the vote out tonight, I would have
laughed you off of Fiji. But it seems like Liz is willing to do
something different tonight. KENZIE:
We're all just
voting Maria, right? -Yeah.
-Like, why does tonight
feel so heavy when it should be so easy? CHARLIE:
 Maria has a lot
 of enemies in this game. Ben, on the other hand,
 has friends on the jury. He's a great storyteller, he's charismatic, and we've been together since day one. So I'm worried the jury
might see us as similar players. He could easily get
 some of my jury votes, and that's dangerous. I don't know. MARIA:
 I am so scared because tonight could be the end for me. I've done all I can do, but if I can pull off this move, I'm gonna win this game. And so, tonight
 is a massive night. It's do-or-die for me. (V O) Fe ed in g a hi gh -q ua li ty d og f oo d doesn't have to cost a whole

pneumonia vaccine. So am I. Because I'm at risk

protection of Prevnar 20®. If you're 19 or older with
 certain chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease,

 pneumonia. In just one dose. Don't get Prevnar 20®
 if you've had a severe allergic
 reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened
 immune systems may have a lower response
 to the vaccine. The most common
 side effects were pain and swelling at the injection
 site, muscle pain, fatigue,
 headache, and joint pain. I want to be able
to keep my plans. I don't want to risk
ending up in the hospital with pneumococcal
pneumonia. That's why I chose
Prevnar 20®. Ask your doctor or pharmacist
 about the Pfizer vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ All right.
Let's just get right into it. Today was an interesting day
at the challenge. Kenzie's in the lead.
Maria's on her tail. And at that point, Liz decides,
"I'm gonna help Kenzie." And it worked.
Kenzie wins individual immunity. Congratulations. But, Maria,
where does that sit, knowing that they were working together
to make sure you didn't win? Honestly, I have
no hard feelings at all. I think at 47 with three small kids at home and three immunity challenges
under my belt, I hold my head up high,
and I feel super proud
of the game that I played. PROBST:
And I just want to say, there are a lot of people
that look at Survivor now and feel like
it's a younger person's game, but then somebody
like you shows up and says, "Oh, no, no. "Oh, I still got game. I got a lot of game." And, Ben, the better you are, the bigger the target. That's just how
the game goes, you know? Maria's a great player. I still think
she is the MVP of the season. But no hard feelings. We all have to outlast, outplay, outwit, outshred,
whatever it is. The bottom line is
we have to play the game. PROBST:
Kenzie, what Ben
is saying is that you do develop relationships, and sometimes
they become like this, but then sometimes they do this. Doesn't mean you can't
play the game with somebody, but it does mean
if I have the opportunity to take you out, I might. And it sounds like Ben
is saying, "I have no problem writing
Maria's name down tonight." -Am I getting this right?
-Yeah, definitely. KENZIE:
Yeah. Maria's incredible. Like, an amazing woman. -Thank you.
-KENZIE: I admire you.
I respect you. I love you deeply. And that is what's
crazy about Survivor, is that I can look someone
in the face and be like, "You could kick my ass
up and down this game." So I have to write
your name down tonight. -I totally understand.
-KENZIE: Because... ...you would beat all of us. You're amazing. -You are wonderful.
-Thank you, Kenzie. -I love you.
-I love you, too. Liz, Ben and Kenzie
have been very open. They're voting Maria.
So, where are you? I'm just ready
to focus on the game. Sometimes I'm like
a horse with blinders on. When I was helping Kenzie
with the puzzle today, I wasn't thinking
about Maria's feelings. Afterwards, I was definitely
thinking about her feelings and what a jerk I looked like. And so it's really hard, but Maria and I, we're like two ships passing in the night.
Like, we could have been the, like,
most dynamic duo out here, but for some reason, instead
of attracting each other, we just kept getting further and
further apart with each vote. Charlie, where are you
with Maria? Yeah, so... Maria and I have worked really side by side
a lot of this game. We've got 24 days together. You know,
you have people that you build these insane bonds with, and then you have to
vote each other out. Tonight, it's almost like
a sibling rivalry moment. PROBST:
Maria, from my vantage point,
you've been very gracious about handling this pressure
and having a target and even having them
double-team, trying to get at you. How are you able
to play the game as hard as you've played

 your ball up an inclined ramp. While the ball is making
 its way back down the ramp, you can work on your puzzle. When the ball
 reaches the bottom, you got to stop, grab your ball, roll it again. But if you fail to get your ball
before it hits the metal track, then you have to wait as the ball slowly makes its way to the bottom. And during that time,
 you can't work on your puzzle. So during this entire challenge,

All right. We get to our final
immunity challenge. On the surface,
it's very simple. Just solve the Survivor logo puzzle in front of you. But there was a twist.
Ben, you were the only person
that didn't make any mistakes
in the challenge. Explain that, because
you walked in and said, "I am all over the place today," and yet something
crystallized, and you were perfect in that challenge. BEN:
You know, I didn't
go into that challenge expecting to win. I said that 'cause it was true.
I haven't been able to sleep. Night terrors, panic attacks. It's just very, very brutal. For some reason, today,
I just decided to say, "This is it.
I'm just gonna go for it." I don't know. I had a blast.
It just came together. PROBST:
Charlie, you were
in it for a while, but a couple of mistakes
cost you this challenge. What did you reflect on
this afternoon? Today's immunity challenge
is potentially the one with the most power
of the season. Ben's, of course, safe tonight, but tonight he can do
whatever the heck he wants. So... it was a lot of reflecting, but there's not much
time for reflection when all I was really doing was making fires all day. Kenzie, you were very close. Would have been your third
individual immunity win. You, too, had issues,
not with getting the ball late, but with just
getting the ball up the ramp, and those few extra tosses
were the difference. You were a few pieces behind. Yeah, I was three pieces behind. And they will probably
haunt me forever. Like, crumbles. I'm happy
for my friend, but here we are. Liz, what was
your experience today? "Liz, you're the biggest threat. "You're definitely
going to fire. I don't know
who's going against you." -Yeah.
-LIZ: And then I just fell apart,
'cause I suck at fire. And, um, I knew this was the one hole in my game. And I'm gonna go to fire.
I mean, he's totally right. I've never
had my name written down, so, he's smarter than he looks. -(chuckles)
-So, Ben, you had
one easy decision. -You knew Liz, immediately.
-Yeah. So then the debate became Kenzie or Charlie. Yeah. And when it came down to
Kenzie and Charlie, I mean, Charlie's the first friend
I made out here. I know that's not great
when it comes to talking about your strategy, but if somebody can give you
a little bit of kindness, it goes a long way, whether
they know it or not. And the hard part is
my friendship with Kenzie is very similar, except
I only met Kenzie at the merge. But I'd say her impact
on me feeling sane-- it's like, I can't...
I can't oversell it. Like, I'm playing Survivor, but I'm hanging out with
my homies and having, like, a real human experience
that, like, you know, it sucks that I have to make this decision. PROBST:
So, Ben, are you ready
to tell us your decision? So, it's gonna
be Liz and Kenzie tonight going at it for fire. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
Which means, Charlie, you made it to the final three. You will take that second spot. This is what you dream of, because
getting to the final three is as much as any player can do. You've gone as far as
you can go. What's the feeling? CHARLIE:
I'm grateful to Ben,
you know, in this moment. Because of the relationship
and the bond that we've built, he's gonna take me
to the final three. And getting there with that bond means just as much to me
as making fire. PROBST:
Kenzie, what's it like
to hear that when you can hear a little bit
of emotion in Ben's voice, and he's very clearly saying, "It wasn't easy for me because of love and friendship"? KENZIE:
Yeah. There is emotion. Like, we have, like,
fallen in love with each other, and it's so complicated. But at the same time, as annoyed as I am
that I have to do this, I am grateful that I'm not
getting my name written down and that I get a chance to try, you know?
That's exciting. (laughs) We're gonna
give it our all, baby. It's down to the ladies tonight. (chuckles)

Oh, my God, it's so good. Guys, we're eating
like humans again. I'm chilling hard today,
 but tonight, I have to give the performance
of a lifetime. My game was a game of honesty built around being myself and relying on my social cards. Everybody called me
 a vibe person. Tonight is about showing that a vibe or chillin' isn't
about being one-dimensional. It's not me using it
 as a gimmick. It's about showing
 I played a hard game from day one. Q:
 Ben outwitted, outlast, outplayed us. The game he played
 was to rock out and fly underneath the radar. If he can articulate
 that he was behind moves, he could receive Q's vote. SODA:
 Ben shreds, Ben rips, Ben rocks. That's who Ben is. He's a social threat
 playing an emotional game that really worked for him,
 but it's "outwit, outplay, outlast,"
not "outlove." My game has been about adapting
 and knowing when to sit back and when to step up. I had a fake idol play. I was a huge part in taking out the biggest threats in the game, and I beat Liz in fire-making. My biggest challenge tonight
 with the jury is that I've written a lot
of their names down. I don't think
anybody's holding back tonight. I know I'm not. Like, guns are blazing. I know my story's better
 than Charlie and Ben's. It's just about how I sell it. VENUS: Kenzie's social game
 was brilliant. I don't think there's a single
person who disliked her or didn't get along with her,
 but I want to hear from her specifically
 what moves she made. You have to have played the game to earn my vote. TIFFANY:
 Kenzie is somebody
 who cares about people, and I do believe that that's why
she lasted so long in the game. Friendship aside,
 gameplay at the forefront, I deeply feel that she's
the best candidate right now. CHARLIE:
I had power in the game
to send home who I thought... I had power in the game
to send home... or to work with who I thought
was going to be able to carry me forward
another vote. I played a very strategic game worthy of the title
 of Sole Survivor. I built alliances, constantly. I never closed a door to anyone. I've always made sure that I put myself in a position
where I was safe, but I also had power. But a lot of what I did
 was in the shadows. Tonight, I want to pull back the curtain on what I've done. The biggest hurdle
 is what the heck is the jury thinking of me? HUNTER:
 Charlie has done a good job of having his finger
 on the pulse. And he's also been winning
 immunity challenges, and so, he has, potentially,
 a story to tell that is worth a million dollars. MARIA: Charlie and I worked
 together so long that I'm pretty sure
 I know all of his moves, except when it came
to him trying to take me out. But my criteria
 is not friendship. I want to make sure that
the person I write down tonight deserves this money. KENZIE:
Is there anything
on your Survivor bucket list you didn't get to do? Uh, win Sole Survivor?
No, I'm kidding. -(laughs)
-Not yet. That one's still up for grabs. VENUS:
 There's always a chance to change the jury's minds. Every single person can sway me
with what they have to say. Q:
 It's not won yet. You can go in and change minds, so don't blow it. SODA:
 I'm not just gonna
 hand money out. You need to have done something. MARIA:
 If you can't
 connect the dots for me, I can't give you my vote. TEVIN:
 What did you do? Tell me that and stand on it. If you can do that, you'll get my vote. LIZ:
 Right now, I have no idea who I'm gonna vote for. TIFFANY: A million dollars
 is a lot of money. I'm not just giving it to you 'cause you cute or we homies. HUNTER:
 I'm about to give somebody
a million dollars. Show that you knew
 what you were doing and why you deserve to win this game. All right.
Charlie, Kenzie, Ben--
glad to see smiles. You should be smiling. You made it to the final three. You did what 15 other players could not do. You survived every Tribal
that you went to. And now, one of the most
unique aspects of Survivor is that
the power shifts from this side to the jury. Eight players who also were in this game
but were voted out-- they decide who wins based on who they think
played the best game. Tonight, you have one job. Convince them it's you. This is where you step up
and claim your victory, that you're the one

tests positive for PD-L1, and does not have
an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. OPDIVO plus YERVOY is not chemotherapy,
it works differently. It helps your immune system fight cancer
in 2 different ways. OPDIVO and YERVOY
can cause your immune system to harm healthy parts
of your body during and after treatment. These problems can be severe
and lead to death. See your doctor right away if you have a cough;
chest pain; shortness of breath;
irregular heartbeat; diarrhea; constipation;
severe stomach pain; severe nausea or vomiting;
dizziness; fainting; eye problems;
extreme tiredness; changes in appetite,
thirst or urine; rash; itching; confusion;
memory problems; muscle pain or weakness; joint pain; flushing;
or fever. These are not all the possible
side effects. Problems can occur together
and more often when OPDIVO
is used with YERVOY. Tell your doctor about
all medical conditions including immune or nervous
system problems, if you've had or plan
to have an organ or stem cell transplant,
or received chest radiation. Your search for 2

into our final Tribal Council. We've been forming the jury
for many days. Tonight is
your first opportunity to ask them the questions
you need to decide who played the best game. Let's get into it. Who wants to get us started? -I will.
-Go, Tiff. Well, first of all,
good evening. And on behalf of myself and everybody sitting here
on the jury, we want to say congratulations
on making it to final three. We have very specific questions
for you guys tonight, and we're looking
for very specific answers. Also, please understand, we are not looking
for Taylor Swift lyrics. We are not looking
for pop culture or rock and roll references.
We are looking for serious
and thought-provoking responses. And with that being said, can you articulate one move that you made on your own that changed the course
of the game? I would like Ben to go first. That's a hard one. For me, I got dealt a hand that really sucked
when I entered the merge, and I had to rely
on my social game. I felt one thing
that I did help contribute to that was sort of a move, was go to the people who had given me
an opportunity to talk and people
who had been on the outs of their crew,
bringing people together, mainly going to Kenzie,
Charlie and Liz. TIFFANY: So, your move
was that you brought Kenzie, Charlie, and Liz together to
change the course of the game? -Of getting me out.
-Of getting Q out to... Okay.
-Yeah. Which was late, but again,
like I said, I was not dealt -the best hand.
-TIFFANY: Charlie,
you have something -to say?
-CHARLIE: Yes.
Just, on that point, when this alliance
came together, Kenzie, Ben, Liz and Venus all wanted Q out
in the final seven vote. But a big part
of my game was making sure that there was a four
going into six, 'cause I needed Q and Maria
as shields, and if Q had gone out there
when Maria won immunity at final six, I, probably, am sitting
on the jury. -Okay, well, since we're on you,
can you tell me what
-Yeah. -the move is that you made that
changed the course of the game?
-My... The move that I would pick
would be the Hunter vote. At the Hunter vote, there was
actually an initial plan from Kenzie
to blindside you, Tiff. But Hunter's
a real social threat and strategic threat,
especially given he's got strong allies
of Soda and Tevin on the jury. That was also the day
that I beat Hunter in individual immunity. You know, that was, to me,
a big accomplishment. So I thought that was the time
to go after Hunter and build out my options. HUNTER:
Not to take away the move
that you made, but I came into this Tribal
gonna play my idol. I had the Shot in the Dark
and the idol in my pocket. And the person that
actually convinced me not to is, uh, Kenzie. She, like, sold me on that. TIFFANY:
Okay, thank you. -Kenzie?
-KENZIE: Okay, so, post-merge, I wanted Tim to go. I knew I couldn't beat him, and
a lot of us had that thought. But at the same time,
Tiff and Q, who were my number-one allies, did not like Ben at all. So it was back and forth between
Tim and Ben all afternoon. Q would come over to me and be
like, "It's Ben. Let's vote Ben. -He has the idol."
-Q: No, no, no. -I was never gonna vote Ben.
-KENZIE: To me... Tiff? -I have to agree with Kenzie.
We went back and forth
-No. -Thank you. Yes, you did.
-several times between Tim and Ben
that day in the woods, -which is why I also was upset.
-KENZIE: All day. -Y'all did, right?
-KENZIE: No, you did. -You did... with us.
-No, no. No. You might have woken up
with that Tim, but you had Ben at 02:00,
you had Tim at 2:30, you had... -Nope.
-KENZIE: At the last minute, you said, "Fine, you can
have Ben." And then I said... -And go Tiff.
-Wait. Tiffany said -she wanted Ben, not Q.
-I'm saying -you guys were
arguing about it all day.
-Q: You wanted Ben out. Q, I'd like for Kenzie
to answer the question. Well, I'm not about
to argue on this jury right now. -Right.
-LIZ: I don't want to argue.
-KENZIE: Regardless, when I was playing
with someone like Q, I can't fight with that.
Obviously. He doesn't remember
what he says to me. You know what I mean?
So I had to play in a way that Q would hear me
and think it was his idea. Like, that
was an intentional move that I wanted
when I won immunity. We went back and forth all day, and I was the last one with
the whisper that made it happen. All right, who's up? Me. The question
I have for each of you is what is one mistake
that you made in this game that you were ultimately able
to flip on its head and capitalize on
to use to your advantage? -Charlie?
-Okay. V, I'm so glad
this question came from you. At the very first vote
in merge limbo, there were-- I don't know--
ten votes for Mo and one vote for Venus. Also, after that vote, Q gave me a big old thump on the back. And let me tell you,
when Q thumps you on the back, you notice it. He took me down to the boat,
lecturing me on, you know, why
I shouldn't have done that move. I was very receptive
to everything you said, and I wanted to, in that moment,
build a relationship with someone who was
having a lot of power early in the game.
The next morning, Q invites me in to the six, and I was part
of a new alliance. So-- very fun. MARIA:
I just want to be clear that I invited you into the six. So you came into the six
on my invitation. Yes, you were my recommendation
letter into the six. -I didn't have one.
-In hindsight, it's not that... -It's just not great to be
-It's literally, like... -No, no, no.
-part of the six. MARIA: You don't want to be
part of the six. This six is... TIFFANY:
You probably should have -just left that part out, then.
-(Hunter mumbling) -Look at his laugh.
-CHARLIE: I just... -I love the six, you know.
-Q: Being in the six -was a one-way ticket home.
-(laughing) KENZIE:
Like, y'all can keep your six. HUNTER:
We just never talked about it. It just was a pathetic excuse
for an alliance. So, Kenzie, you're up. -Good-good response, though.
-KENZIE: One mistake I made was I got cocky. I wasn't paying attention.
I got confident, I got comfortable,
and ultimately, Tiff went home. Tiff and I were like,
"Don't even play the idol, girl. Like, you'll get into six.
We're good." -We were riding too high
together, okay?
-We were. I'll be the first to admit it.
I got cocky, too, girl. -That's why I'm over here.
-KENZIE: Yeah, we... That hit me like a bullet train.
I immediately started rebuilding relationships
with everyone, paying attention
to who was working with who, and it became very apparent that
Maria and Q were number ones, which led the three of us and Liz coming together
to ultimately take out the two biggest threats
who had started working together -at that vote.
-Q: So, of course. -Yeah.
-Q: Did y'all come together at six or seven?
'Cause at seven, why would Ben write your name
as the contingency plan? 'Cause he was drunk on pizza. That's what I'm saying.
So, I'm confused. KENZIE:
That is the question
of the hour. We... we worked together
at seven, but just because
Ben wrote my name down, whether it wasn't an accident
or not, I didn't go home. Well, she had an idol.
If she would've played it, you would have. Maybe. But we were working together, and we all ultimately decided. That is true. KENZIE:
Yeah. Thank you, Liz. But just to address
the-the accidental voting. -Yeah.
-TEVIN: I know you had
ate pizza, but were you a bit lackadaisical
in the tribe, and you weren't... -you listening during Tribal,
and that's...
-BEN: No. I think, on top of me having pizza in my stomach, I have been having night terrors
since about day 13 or 14. The truth is I lost my bearings. I was really as out of it
as it could be. -Yeah. Okay. Got it.
-And we can all appreciate that. There's a lot of us looking back at Tribal Council,
should have seen red flags. I mean, we're talking
about idol, idol, idol, idol. And so,
I'll give you the benefit -of the doubt, you know.
-BEN: Yeah. Sometimes Tribals are a little
bit crazy, and we miss things. Yeah. PROBST:
Who's up? -Tevin.
-TEVIN: Hi, y'all. So, my question
to you all tonight is I want your
one best example of how you used one of us
sitting up here on the jury to further your game
and make it to the final three. -Let's start with Ben.
-BEN: All right. At some point in the game,
I was stuck with Q and Maria for, like,
three days straight. For those three days, all I was fed was,
"This is what you need to do, this is who
you shouldn't trust." Nobody asked me
what my input was on anything. There was no moment
where it was like, "Hey, this is what I think
our next move has to be." -Well, that's the point.
-So, can I ask
the follow-up question? -BEN: Totally.
-Wouldn't you assert your ideas -Yeah.
-on the group to try
to make a move of your own? I took my "chillin' hard"
approach, which was, "I'm gonna listen,
I'm gonna hear what they have to say," and using
that information is what I went to Kenzie with,
I went to Charlie with, what I went to Liz with, and it's what allowed me
to slip through the cracks, whether I was thought of
as a threat or not. -Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Kenzie, you're up. KENZIE:
So, after the Tiff
blindside, I was out for blood, and then
I had to manage my emotions. I wanted Q out
immediately after. I was so upset, I was so hurt. But I had to placate
and pretend to go with numbers to gain Q's trust back
to get back in good graces. And that's how quick I went from
devastated crying all night, out for blood to, "Okay,
I'm back working with the guy "that I want out of here
so I can get him out tomorrow if I can gain his trust today." -Great.
-Thank you.
-Excellent. -Charlie?
-Charlie?
-Concise. Uh, so, for me, the person
that I used was actually Tevin. For me, coming into the merge,
Nami was an enigma. They're either the best actors
in the world or there are really
cracks everywhere. -Yeah.
-But there was so much
information going around because Soda was telling me she was tight with Tevin,
but here Tevin was saying he wanted
to blindside Soda, and what I figured out from that is
that Tevin was the power player. Okay. -Thank y'all.
-CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah. HUNTER:
I got it ready, Jeff. -Okay. Go, Hunter.
-HUNTER: Okay. So, last Tribal Council,
Ben was on the hot seat and had to lay out
a lot of information as to who he saw as threats, who can make fire and not. So, my question is gonna be
for Charlie and for Kenzie. If you were in Ben's seat, who would you put in fire
and why would you do it? I would have put the exact
same thing that Ben did. I would have gone against Liz. I know that these two boys have a similar game
and that I have a better chance at beating them
than I had beating Liz. And I would have
taken a chance on myself. -That's what I would have done.
-HUNTER: Awesome. Appreciate it. -Charlie?
-Yes. So, if I had won
the necklace that day, I think I would have done things
a little bit differently. -Okay.
-I think I would have taken Liz with me to the final three. I think, personally, my game could stack up well
against hers. I think that's someone
that I could have beat, -despite her being a threat.
-HUNTER: Okay, well, then, was there any moment
that you thought, "Hey, Ben, let me do this? Let me put myself in,
because Liz isn't the threat"? My game has been all about
getting to this moment. So I didn't feel the need
to push insanely hard to get into fire for a move that I didn't think was
going to buy me all that much. HUNTER:
Right, and I appreciate that. But I hope getting to this point in a safe way
doesn't hurt you, right? You said your goal
was to get to this point. I hope your goal
was to win this game. You better believe it.
That has been my laser focus this whole time. My goal was
to win this freaking game. Okay. Yup. -Soda?
-SODA: Um, I have been on the jury the longest. Um, I have been listening,
um, to a lot. Ben, my take on you was that you
were playing an emotional game and that you had no agency. Charlie, my take on you was that you were playing the middle
very closely with Maria, but you did not set yourself
apart from her. And, Kenzie, my take on you was that you were brought
into votes pre-merge. And post-merge, you said,
"Tell me who to vote for." Now, I've heard a lot
of information that, you know, contests
some of those things, but I want each of you to take 30 seconds to either prove me right
or persuade me why I'm wrong. Also, I'll be
the 30-second timer. When I say "time," please stop. SODA:
Kenzie? So, I'm a social player. I'm not the loudest voice
in the room. I'm not the one
who's gonna be a driving force, but I am a number, and I am
also thinking strategically. Like, my social game
is my strategic game. They are one and the same.
I know they're supposed to be separate,
but I'm a people person. I've had deep conversations
with each of you. I've, like, held half of you while you've cried
about various things. Like, yeah, I got
brought along on votes. That's how I ended up here. -I'll take it. I'll own it.
It's true.
-TIFFANY: Time. -I'm not gonna say
I drove a vote. Okay.
-SODA: Time. Nice ownership. Thank you.
Charlie? CHARLIE:
Maria and I were
partners in crime for a lot of the game,
but by the time Maria was winding back her fist to throw a punch at me, I had already
put the pieces in place that were setting up her demise. I put together the four
that protected me from the punch that you and Q
threw at me at final six, and ultimately voted both of you
out of the game at six and at five,
exactly how I designed after the Tiffany vote. I thought that I needed... -to differentiate...
-Time.
-Time. -Ben?
-Oh, yeah. I mean,
I'll definitely agree. I'm probably
the most emotional person, most "cries in this game"
this season, but that's what I had to do, and it crushed me that I felt I came
into the merge with this plan that got wrecked, and I was very fortunate that how emotional I was
opened the doors to make friendships and bonds that allowed me
to be part of moves that I wanted to be part of.
And, yeah, I openly admitted
I was a goat for a few votes. But when the turn came
to not be that, the only way -that would have happened...
-Time. -SODA: Time.
-Yeah. Cool. Thank you all so much.
I know that was hard, um, -but you all did great.
-BEN: All good. Q, you haven't asked a question. All righty.
The most important thing for me and my vote
is this simple question. What do you plan
to do with the money and how will it change
your life? -Ben?
-Um, you know, I'm a musician. I get a lot
of great things in my life, but I don't make a lot of money. I want to give my parents
some sort of retirement 'cause they're hardworking
immigrants that always put food
on the table and weren't around
because of how hard they worked. And at the same time,
I want to join up with my best friend's
nonprofit program and help bring music education back to schools
in South Florida. It's an initiative I've already
been a part of called Young Musicians Unite. And having an artistic
expression for kids is a way for them to feel comfortable
with who they are, which is something
I had to learn the hard way 'cause nobody gave me that
opportunity when I was a kid. Q:
Thank you, Ben. -Charlie?
-CHARLIE: Yeah, so, number one: family is more
important to me than anything. And to be where I am at
in my life-- you know, I'm 25 years old, and a million dollars
is a whole lot of money. Life-changing. I can set up
the rest of my life for me and my family. You know, part of this
experience has been getting to meet
and know all of you. And if there's one thing
I know, it's that every single person here
had something bigger than themselves
they were playing for. I've talked with a lot of you
about the work that I do. I've worked a lot
in immigration law. There's a lot of organizations
that I would want to make a donation to,
and I would also want to, you know, bet on myself and pay
for law school with this money. Thank you, Charlie. -Kenzie?
-KENZIE: I've been in my career
since I was 15 years old, not because it sounded fun. I would have loved to enjoy
high school like a normal kid. I couldn't. I started working in salons
when I was 15, got my beauty license
by the time I was 17, opened my salon
by the time I was 24. I opened it
to give people a place to work. I don't make any money off
of the chairs that I rent out. If a business person
looked at my business plan, they would lose their minds
and be like, "You could make so much money
off of this." It's not about the money. The
business is not about the money. It's about providing people
an opportunity. So this money
would be mine, for me. I would invest it and I would
set up myself so I don't have to be 70 years old
doing bang trims on kids, okay? -(laughing)
-Like, I'm trying to set myself up
to have a family and to be able to be
financially secure in myself. This was my venture.
My life is... has been for everyone else. -Q: Thank you so much.
-No problem. Q:
Yes, ma'am. Well done, jury. Every single question got different information. Well done. Thank you. Charlie, Kenzie, Ben, I'm gonna give you 30 seconds. -Okay.
-PROBST: If you think there was something
not brought up that is pertinent to your game,
this is your chance to make it. Charlie, 30 seconds. A pattern I wanted to highlight was "never close a door." Always keep my options open. Everyone here knows
that I've strategized with them at one point or another
in the game. It's what gave me options. It's what let me see my position
in the game, stay safe and have power. That's how I feel like
I got here today, and I really just wanted to hit
that point home to all of you. I think I played hard.
Thank you for listening. -PROBST: Kenzie?
-Thank you. KENZIE:
Oh, to sum it up, um, I went on every sanctuary reward
because I am a social butterfly. I competed
in every single challenge from the first one
to the fire-making. Won two of those,
thanks to some help, because you get by with a little help
from your friends. I came in here trying to make
friends, and thank you all for listening. Um... Yeah. I... I just love you all. Thank you so much. (laughs) -Thank you, Kenzie.
-Thank you.
-PROBST: Ben. Not that I think
it stacks up against them, but, uh, with everything
I've been through in my life, I did want to come here
and be the emotional me and not the bravado frontman
performer version of me. And even though
I had a hard time with the night terrors, I got from the bottom
and had fun climbing my way through moves
towards the end. I played the game I wanted
to play, and I'm glad I got to meet y'all,
because y'all rock, and... -Q: Thank you.
-Who rocks? -Thanks, Ben.
-You rock.
-You rock. TIFFANY:
Thanks, Ben. -I'll accept that.
-Right. The one, right? Come on. That's for you there. -(laughing)
-PROBST: Charlie, Kenzie, Ben,
it's not easy to sit in those seats
and defend your game, but you have to claim your victory,
and one of you just did. The question is who. The only thing left to do
is vote. -(laughing)

LYBALVI helps us push back against bipolar 1. Once-daily prescription
 LYBALVI is proven to treat manic
 or mixed episodes of bipolar 1 in adults, to help you
 push back. Elderly patients with
 dementia have increased risk of
 death or stroke. Do not take LYBALVI
 if you are taking opioids or are in opioid withdrawal. The samidorphan in LYBALVI can
 cause severe opioid withdrawal that can lead to
 hospitalization or increase risk of life-threatening
 overdose. Get emergency help if you
 have trouble breathing, become very drowsy with slowed
 or shallow breathing, feel faint, very dizzy,
 or confused or have a fever, stiff
 muscles, rash, swollen glands or problems
 with your liver, kidneys, heart,
 or lungs. Other serious side effects
 may include high cholesterol, weight gain, potentially fatal
 high blood sugar, uncontrolled body movements
 which may be permanent, dizziness upon standing,
 or falls. Are you ready? Ask your doctor about LYBALVI. Looking for co-pay savings? For info text “COPAY” to
