 I have the numbers. ROME:
 I took the idol that's good
 for only one Tribal Council. Rome is not gonna be
the first one gone from Lavo. SAM:
 I just wanted to share
 that moment with Sierra... ...as number ones and friends. You got it. I feel like this one's
gonna be small but mighty. TK:
I'm just not used to losing. I don't hang with people
who are cool with losing. I don't even associate myself
with that. TIYANA: I don't want
 to work with someone who I feel disrespected me. So right now
my emotion is saying, "Vote TK." ♪ ♪ If anybody has an advantage or an idol
and you want to play it... GABE:
Jeff. -Playing this for yourself?
-(Caroline gasps) Yeah. First vote: Sue. Second person voted out
of Survivor 47: -TK.
-Wow. The tribe has spoken. All righty. ♪ ♪ Here. Try my frond. CAROLINE:
Yes. That was so cool,
you played your idol. GABE:
I know, right? Honestly, I just,
I heard my dad's voice -in the back of my head.
-There you go. You know... And he was just screaming,
"Play it." Last season on Survivor, I watched way too many people go home
with an idol in their pocket. The dumbest move. With an idol in my pocket. There it is. TIFFANY:
 I should have played my idol. I went home with an idol. They blindsided me with an idol in my pocket. And I'm not gonna
allow that to happen to me. (Tiyana laughs) KYLE:
 Tribal Council was nuts. There was some things
that played out that I didn't really expect. Mm-hmm. GABE:
Uh-huh. Yeah. KYLE:
 I took a risk. I threw a hit at Sue
instead of TK. I don't know
 if it's a mistake yet, but I just need to make sure that I'm in the right ring
 with the right bull, so that way
I'm not the next one going home. Respectful. What? (both cheering quietly) CAROLINE:
 I am so happy to say the vote went exactly the way
 I thought it was going to go. It was so perfect. We did it. Nobody else did it. We did it. We pulled off
a friggin' blindside. Like, that's like, "Check." But Kyle voted for me,
 and I take it personally. That's a man who's underestimating me. And I get the same feeling I got when I went
 into the aviation industry, which is male-dominated. So I totally know how
to handle guys like that. If we go
 to another Tribal Council, I am gonna get revenge. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ RACHEL:

Oh, my God. ANIKA:
 I did not get more than 20 minutes
of closed-eyed time because our shelter still looks like
 it's a day one shelter, which made for horrible sleeping conditions. And I woke up
so, so, so exhausted. RACHEL:
So what do we want
to do for priorities? -I feel like
we need to fix the shelter.

-Okay. This tribe
 has been focusing on vibes instead of camp life, but obviously those tasks
still need to get done. Sam, can you pull this one out? -Where am I pulling it?
-Just take it out. SAM:
 We're almost
 a week into this game. We're running on fumes
 at this point, and we have this entire
 fishing kit right in our camp. And instead of being like,
"Hey, let's all go and try and get some food today,"
we're sitting here saying, "Hmm. That bamboo
dug into my side a little bit weird last night." What if this big boy
we take out and just fill in with a smaller guy
and put rocks under it? It's bamboo. It's not the Ritz-Carlton. Quit trying
 to make it the Ritz-Carlton. It feels like Anika
really wants to have control of everything
that happens in camp life. Where do you want me to put it? Like, something around here, because the last thing you want
is for it to cave in. SAM:
 She believes that she's the figurehead
 of the Gata tribe, but I'm just like, "Give me a break." I'm rolling my eyes and
I'm trying not to say anything. I'm trying not to be
 so obviously irritated, but I'm just, like,
 I'm pissed off. ANDY:
 People talk
 about a Survivor wall. And the Survivor wall
 is when, you know, you're trucking along, and then you wake up one day, and it all just,
it comes crashing down. And I think this is
 the case for two people in particular-- Anika and Sam. ANIKA:
Sam, if you're able to create
a base right here, I support the two. If not,
it's gonna be way too heavy. -Where do you want me to get it?
-Chop it? ANDY:
Like I said from the beginning,
 I want to gather data. And what people tell you is,
like, second-level data. It's okay, but there's
better, more substantial, cleaner data out there,
and that is people's actions. And when Sam
 and Anika are bickering over the clothesline,
 it's like, okay. That's real.
They're not faking that one. I don't know.
I think this will hold. As long as we just don't,
like, throw things. We, like, put 'em on there
lightly, and it'll be okay. ANIKA:
I don't think
it's just that, Sam. It's the pure weight
of the wet clothes. But it's staying in now. I-I know now with four pieces
of clothes on there... -...that are partially dry.
-Okay. I'm just saying, scientifically
and mathematically, the weight will pull it in. Okay. Then let's machete it here. ANDY:
Ooh. We've been sawing it. That's
been more successful, Sam. Okay. -Yeah.
-Yeah. ANDY:
 I do currently feel
 like I am on the bottom, but there's trouble in paradise
 here on Gata. And so the festering conflict makes me
 really, really valuable. And it would be
a very sweet turnaround for me. I think I've got some life here.

Yeah. ROME:
I want to know
the Survivor record for most fish caught in a day. Yep.
That's the sole purpose of that. Yeah. That's the only reason. Just so I can beat it by one
and be done. AYSHA: Since day one,
 Rome has been talking about, "I can't wait to get out there. "As soon as we get fishing gear,
I'm gonna be out there all hours of the day." And so I knew as soon as Jeff said, "Fishing gear," I was like, "Oh, we're
gonna have to deal with Rome." If you have
a six-foot Hawaiian sling, you have a four-foot
kill radius, essentially. You want to be that close
to the fish, and then bam. -Okay. Okay.
-So it doesn't
have time to react. At random times,
there'll just be water that comes into the mouthpiece,
and I have to go up to the top and, like,
readjust it and, like, just hope
it doesn't fill up again. AYSHA:
 If you ask Rome, every piece of fishing gear
is labeled "Rome." ROME:
Oh, you want to try it? GENEVIEVE:
Yeah. So, the current's
really strong underwater. -Like, you'll feel
yourself moving away.
-Is it? Okay. Okay. -Okay, I'll wait.

with a Hawaiian sling is so difficult to do. Like, only a few Survivors
are really, like, doing it, like, and
doing it all right, you know? KISHAN:
 Rome is the only one, successfully,
who has caught fish, but Rome has also been the one who's been
 using the fishing gear for a majority of the time. Yeah. (groans) -You okay?
-Yeah, just... AYSHA:
Exactly. TEENY:
Yeah. I think I just
have a different mindset. Like, if somebody was
catching fish for me, like, bro, I'd be
getting the pot ready. I'd be trying to make a fire. -Yeah.
-This is just ridiculous, man. AYSHA:
 I bet you -he thinks we're so lazy.
-TEENY: He does. We're spending
 24 hours a day together, and that's obviously going to expose us
in our raw forms-- what our annoyances are, what our patience levels are. ROME:
Yo! There was a shark about
ten feet away from me just now. I know. (laughs) TEENY:
 Which, for me, works out
 perfectly because Rome is a large personality person. Why didn't
you bring the flippers? I hate flippers, but, uh,
no flippers, no problem. (excited chatter) ROME:
 And I realized, hey, I'm kind of good
with the Hawaiian sling. That's a great feeling
 because now I realize, "Man, I don't have
 to starve out here." -Pass it off. Ah!
-(laughter) But then I started to realize,
okay, I had to make the fire. -AYSHA: Oh, there we go.
-TEENY: There we go. ROME:
 I had to clean the fish.
 I had to get the fish. So, like, at this point, how appreciative are you? And why should
I even give you some? GENEVIEVE:
 Rome has caught a few fish. They're, like, this big, like the kind
you would have as a pet, and... Rome decided to eat two of the four fish himself. -Can I put this whole thing

nothing to deserve this. Absolutely nothing. You aren't
even in my alliance, Aysha. Why should I give you
a big chunk of meat? So guess what I did. The last two fish,
I ate them right next to Aysha. Right next to her.

 Hello. -We're happy
to have you back.

All right, let's go sit down. I'll give you the lowdown, then. -Okay. Are we ready
for story time?
-Yeah. So, for starters,
they sent Kyle and Rome. SAM:
 I have a feeling
 Anika is somebody who is looking out for herself,
 first and foremost. So I have a lot of doubt
about whatever Anika says probably
 is not the entire truth. And if not, why am I not getting
the full side of the story? They asked me,
were you two dating? -(Andy laughs)
-Who? -ANIKA: You two.
-You two. -Us two?
-RACHEL: Oh, my God.
-(Andy laughs) Yeah, they were like, "You got
to tell us. You got to tell us. Is Sam and Sierra,
like, a thing?" SAM:
 This is ridiculous.
 I am engaged. Hannah, babe,
if you're watching this, I am not in a relationship
with Sierra on Survivor. It is a strict, strategic relationship.
 I promise you. I'm thinking about you
the whole time, and I'm talking about you
every day. So they're not a thing. -GABE AND SUE: Really?
-TIYANA: What? They actually both have fiancés,
but Anika said -that they're jiving
on a whole different note.
-GABE: Yeah. -They're basically like
head dogs at the moment.
-Uh-huh. -Wow.
-TIYANA: What the hell?
-Yeah. That's crazy. SIERRA:
 What? I'm 27 years old. He's 24 years old. He's engaged. I'd better be engaged
when I get home. So it's like, "Come on." Like, it concerns me that now
 there's this speculation that Sam and I
 are working together because that could really
 blow up both of our games. So I'm not really sure where
 they're getting that from, but that's something we
definitely need to keep in mind moving forward in this game. KYLE:
There are three scrolls. And so two of these scrolls
are Lose Your Vote. Oh, no. One of them is an advantage. -TIYANA: Holy...
-KYLE: And you have to pick. And so I put my hand in the bag,
and I nailed a Lost Your Vote. No. -I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-...if you lost it two times. So I lost my vote there. So my ass is burnt
for the next Tribal Council. -You had a choice
to play the game.
-RACHEL: Yeah. And I chose to save my vote. ♪ ♪ ANIKA:
 I don't want Andy knowing
that I lost my vote, but I need to make sure that my alliance members
 are aware of that if we go to Tribal. The thing is, there wasn't
a choice to play the game. -I had to play the game.
-Okay. And I had to reach in
and get a scroll. And I unfortunately got one out
and it said, "Lose Your Vote." -Okay. No worries.
-Okay.
-And... -Okay, good.
-Fair. Yeah. SIERRA:
Don't let it stress you, though. Don't let it get in your head. You're good. I think I'm actually okay. -You're okay.
-Yeah. Even though I lost my vote, Sierra, Rachel and I--
 we're solid. They've given me the confidence
that I'll be okay. I pick one,
and it was Lose Your Vote. But in my head I'm like,
"There's no way I'm going for the second one." Like, I'm not losing my vote
for two Tribal Councils. So I was like, "You know what? I'll take the loss,
and that's it." No, I don't. It was up there. I just left it in the bag.
I left it at the table. Yeah. There is no way in living heck that I'm telling Aysha and Sol
 I got an advantage. I was lying my butt off
 to them, man. They have no idea. And right now I feel
like I'm playing it perfectly. -All right. So, anything new
to actually say, or...?
-(chuckles) -You think I would go out there
and lose my vote? Come on.
-Oh, my God. So what'd you get this time? -Steal a Vote.
-Get out. Yep. So, guaranteed first Tribal
goes the way I want. TEENY: Every advantage Rome
 brings back, it kind of pushes me more and more into
the alliance with him, Rome, Genevieve and Kishan, because
there's not much I can do when Rome has an idol
and Rome has a Steal a Vote. You know? Like, those are things that I can't really
fight against. So I'd rather swim with. "You now have power in the game. This advantage
allows you to steal a vote." TEENY:
 If I'm reading it right, Rome sees me, Genevieve, him and Kishan as the Lavo four--
 the group that's gonna go into the merge together
 and play this game. I'm so happy for you and us. TEENY:
 I believe Rome's loyal. He's shown us with telling us
about his advantages, and he's shown us

Lavo and Gata
getting your first look at the new Tuku tribe. TK voted out
at the last Tribal Council. ROME:
Wow. Shocking. Way to go, guys. (laughs) PROBST:
All right. -Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?
-(all assent) -First things first.
Got to take 'em back.
-Come on. Come on.
Don't make me fight you for it. Yeah, okay. -Nice.
-Let's go. Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs. -(Rome exhales)
-For today's challenge, one tribe member is gonna climb
 to the top of a tall tower, leap out into the ocean. You're then gonna climb over
a crate and back into the ocean where you will
 retrieve a key underwater. You're then going
 to cross a balance beam and swim to the finish. The rest of the tribe is going
 to run the same course, only in pairs, retrieving two more keys
 along the way. Once you have all your keys,
 you will use them to unlock and solve
 a Survivor seahorse puzzle. First two tribes
to finish win immunity, safe from the vote, nobody
going home from your tribe. In addition,
you're playing for a reward. -Want to know
what you're playing for?

It's not food, but it'll help. SUE:
Yes! -PROBST: A large tarp.
-Hammock. Wow. Two hammocks, the tarp. (all exclaiming) -I'll take that.

no hammocks. One small tarp will still
make a big difference. -Yeah.

with me at Tribal Council... -Hell no.

the third person voted out of Survivor 47,

I will keep your flint. Tuku, you are playing
to earn yours back. Before I send you out
into this challenge, let's just take a moment,
because when you're at home and you see this, you think,
"Oh, that'd be so fun." Now that you're here
in the middle of the ocean with a very tall tower
and a very deep ocean, anybody here willing to say,
"It's a little more intimidating than I thought
it might have been"? -Absolutely.
-Definitely.
-Really? -Yeah.
-PROBST: Kishan, what is it now that you're out here? I never knew how to swim until four months
before I came out here. -Wow.
-And I took swimming lessons, so, of course, there's that
voice in the back of my head that's like, "Dude,
you just learned how to do this. "Now you're doing this
in an ocean. "You're doing this exhausted in a deep, deep ocean." It-It's-it's scary. It becomes

a swimming pool.

you have one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Cannot be Aysha.
Who's it gonna be? -Me.

Genevieve gonna sit out. Now, I'm curious. I got to ask. Kishan, you admitted
swimming is not your strength, but you're gonna participate
in this one. Why? You got to believe in yourself. It's a mentality thing.
And if you don't believe in yourself
and you start doubting yourself in these moments,
it's gonna carry forward. That's why you apply

doing a nice job together. Rachel with another piece -for Gata.
-Beautiful. Gata's got some momentum
right now. Lavo would like to get
a little momentum, get in this. Does this go here? No. Caroline trying
to get another piece for Tuku. Will it fit? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it does.
That's another piece for Tuku. I got it, I got it, I got it. PROBST:
Rachel with another piece. Lavo now in trouble
and decidedly in last place. The only tribe that hasn't gone
to Tribal Council. It is Gata and Tuku
doing a great job on the puzzle. That's it. That's it. PROBST:
Lavo in dead last. The inevitable appears
to be coming. Yeah, that one right there. That one that-- That was it,
that was it, that was it. That was literally the piece. -I saw it.

It is Gata, then Tuku. Yes. Yeah. -SAM: Yes. Yes.

Gata with another piece. Gata down to three pieces now. This is in the deep freeze.
Lavo's going to Tribal Council. I'm gonna call it.
Genevieve can only watch. Rachel trying to get
that piece in. She's got it. Gata down to their last piece. For immunity and reward. -Gata has it.

large tarp and two hammocks. It now just comes
to a nice finish for Tuku. SUE:
You got it, Gabe. There it is.
Tuku down to two now, as Tribal Council's inevitable
for Lavo. Tuku down to their last piece. (cheering) PROBST:
There it is. -Tuku wins immunity and reward.
-(cheering) Safe from Tribal Council, sending Lavo to Tribal Council
for the first time this season, where somebody
will be the third person voted out of Survivor 47. Ah! Come on! Gata, congratulations. Nobody going home from Gata.
No Tribal Council tonight. In addition, nice reward
waiting for you back at camp. Hot day like this,
that tarp will help a lot. Two hammocks will make things a little more comfortable. -Well done.
-Thank you. Tuku, nice job. (overlapping chatter) Yeah. PROBST: Nobody going home from
Tuku, no Tribal Council tonight. Smaller tarp waiting for you
back at camp. -Well done.

your flint back. -Thank you.

enjoy the night off. -Big jump?
-PROBST: Celebrate. -Go, guys.
-(laughing): Yay! (Kyle howls) All right, Lavo.
New part of the game, Rome. You have not had
to vote somebody out. Some fans would say you haven't
actually played Survivor until you've gone
to Tribal Council. What are you feeling right now? I mean, me personally,
I'm feeling a lot of nervousness. I mean,
I came back from the journey and told my tribe
exactly what happened. So they all know
that I don't have a vote. So, really, I have no say
in what happens tonight. So I'm just gonna be sitting
there like a bump on a log. So, who knows
how tonight's gonna go? All right, Lavo,
Tribal Council tonight, where somebody will be the third
person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing,
I'm gonna take your flint. Sorry for you, Genevieve. -(Genevieve sighs)
-You will have a chance
to earn it back at the next challenge. Swim out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council. SOL:
 Apparently,
 Rome does not have a vote. Just from reading
 his body language, I think that guy's lying. I don't believe
what he's saying right now. But we just need
 to be prepared for everything because who knows
 what could happen tonight? Outwit, outplay, outlast. Think you have what it takes?

to volunteer to leave?
-(Kishan laughs) All right. Okay.
We got that out of the way. TEENY:
 This loss means that it's time for lines to be drawn, lines that I've been really,
really procrastinating having to show. My number one is Kishan. And I know that we're leaning more towards working
 with Rome and Genevieve. That means the decision is now who to vote out-- Sol or Aysha. I have to decide and try to hurt as little amount
of people as possible so that I can still keep
this position I'm in, which is pretty good. How are you feeling? -I mean, I feel so good
with you guys.
-Mm-hmm. I feel scared,
the same as I did about Rome. (sputters) AYSHA:
 Then how would you feel
 if it was Genevieve? TEENY:
 I think it's the safer option. AYSHA:
I would love more than anything to target Rome, but I cannot, because we have
this large suspicion that he has something that he found on this beach,
 because that man was looking like
 his life depended on it. And then there was a hard stop, and he just stopped looking. If we focus today
on getting out Genevieve, 'cause I just don't think
we can get Rome out. -I don't see us there.
-No, I don't. Neither do I. -We can't take that risk.

if they start talking -and it seems like
it's gonna be one of you...
-Mm-hmm. -Okay. Okay.
-I do. -I really do.
-I appreciate that. I would not be comfortable
with you going home. With Aysha,
 I want her to feel like I'm good with her and that I'm
going with our original plan, that I'm working with her
and Sol and Kishan. Though, in small ways, I'm trying to give her little warnings that, "Hey, "just maybe this might not go
the way you want. "And if it doesn't,
are you going to be down "to work with me
and vote out Sol to preserve your own life
in this game?" So, the plan is actually going
to be Aysha, -but we want Sol to play
his Shot in the Dark, so...
-Okay. -I hear you. I hear you.
-That's.... and... Yeah. You know, if I had to choose
one, I would choose Sol. ROME:
 Okay. What's your reasoning? Teeny started
 to break it down a little bit, and she made perfect sense,
because right now, for my game, the biggest threat is someone
else finding that next idol, because I have
to play mine tonight. You made such a good point. -'Cause I have
to play my idol tonight.
-You have to. Which means that there's gonna
be an idol back out here. Yes, absolutely. And you know
it's gonna be a mad dash. The second I get back to camp, I'm hitting the jungle
in the middle of the night. -Exactly.
-Like, I'm that type of person. And you know who else would? -Sol.
-Sol. I have wanted to vote out Sol since the start of this game. I cannot stand the dude
 at this point. So the fact that it ended up
turning from Aysha over to Sol, that just made me smile
ear to ear. I'd be willing to write
Sol's name down lickety-split. I cannot wait
to do that tonight. So as long as we can get him to not play
 his Shot in the Dark, then the plan is foolproof. -But...
-Oh, do you? -Yeah.
-'Cause I have no ... clue. -Yeah, well...
-So... I'm, at this point,
99% sure it's gonna be Aysha. -99? Bro.

of conversations... -Really?

-They-they feel like
they want to keep you around -because you're strong.
-Thank God. And you do carry us through

-'Cause I don't have a vote. So, like, I'm trying
to stay good with everybody. -Right, right, right.
All right, cool.
-Just in case, like... -You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, that would only hurt me
if I was like... That's right. That's right.
That's right. That's right. I-I get what you're saying,
but, yeah, that just doesn't... Yeah. No. Like, I...
Tonight I can't. I just got to be honest
with everybody and stay mellow. That's-that's my best game plan,
like I said. That's all I could do, so... SOL:
 Rome is talking to me
 like I'm an idiot. "Sol, I don't have a vote, "so I'm not gonna get voted out. "Just so you know, everyone is gonna vote Aysha out." I don't know if Rome
 is just completely clueless... If I was you,
I'd just draw the continent. Asia. Like...
(laughing) Yeah. That would be
very cool of me. ...or if Rome is one of the best Survivor players ever. ROME:
 Me and Sol just talked, and -I told Sol that
the plan is gonna be Aysha.
-KISHAN: Mm-hmm. "And if you want to be
on the right side of the vote, you should just vote Aysha."
And he was like, "It sucks, but I want
to stay in the game, so..." There was no inkling
he was scared -about maybe using
the Shot in the Dark?
-I made him feel really good about it, so... Is there any world where
we bring in Aysha on this four? -Yes.
-TEENY: Yeah. KISHAN:
 Aysha's genuinely someone I would love to work with
in the future because
she is such a strategist. This is also a bit
 of a selfish move of looping Aysha into the plan
 because I want it to be that Teeny and I tell her, so
that, going forward, she knows, "We saved your butt 'cause your name was gonna be
the vote today." Okay. So he does for sure? -TEENY: He's not telling us.
-Right. TEENY:
There's only one guaranteed, I feel, safe situation to do, and it is vote Sol. AYSHA:
 The fact that they trusted me with that information about
Rome's idol means the world. But I don't want Sol to go home. I think the worst thing
 in the world that we could do is keep Genevieve
and Rome together. KISHAN:
 Yeah, but, hey... KISHAN:
 Aysha is not budging from wanting
 to vote out Genevieve. And, you know, that's definitely
very concerning, 'cause if Aysha keeps discounting
 any potential other options, that's really hard
to work with going forward. She was not... -KISHAN: She was not budging.
-...hearing us. TEENY:
 I feel a very close personal connection with Aysha, and I know we're both rooting
 for each other in this game
 and want to work together, but she's kind of digging
 her own grave at this point. TEENY:
 So tonight the question is, if Aysha won't work with me and vote out Sol, is it worth
 keeping her in this game? But, yeah,
 somebody's gonna be upset. Somebody's going to be betrayed. But I have to make the decision
 that's going to guarantee me
 to go further in this game. Th is i sn ' t Ch ar mi n! No wonder I don't feel

Go ahead and grab a torch, dip it in, and get fire. ♪ ♪ This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council, because in this game
fire represents your life, and when the fire is gone,
so are you. So let's get into it. The first Tribal Council
for this group. -Rome, every first...
-(Rome laughs) -Why are you laughing?
-I just was, like, hoping
that you didn't pick me first, but it's okay.
Let's do this, man. We here. PROBST:
Is there a curse about getting -the first question?
-TEENY: No. -That's just Rome.
-ROME: I got a superstition about sitting
in the front middle, and I'm sitting
in the front middle. So, I mean, I already got
a lot of nerves already. -Yeah. We're already 0 for 2.
-ROME: Yeah, exactly, exactly. -Not looking good.
-Yeah. No, sir. Let's do something different.
Let's go to Genevieve. -(Rome sputters)
-Genevieve.
-Thanks, Rome. What I was gonna ask was,
coming into tonight, what do you think this tribe
hopes to be with tonight's vote? GENEVIEVE:
I think everyone
today was a little emotional because tonight's
killing someone's dream, and so the hope is that the five
who go back are still cohesive. So, Sol, do you get the feeling that tonight's vote is based on trying
to make the tribe stronger, or this is about alliances and
I got to make sure I'm in one? I thought
it was about alliances. I felt really good
with who I was paired with, but I got a very uneasy feeling
in my stomach, and so... So, as we sit here right now,
you're feeling that uncertainty? Yeah, it's, uh,
it's not a good feeling that I'm feeling right now. Can you overthink it, Rome? You can definitely overthink it. Once you get paranoid
and, you know, you start talking with people, and
you might say the wrong thing, and that might make them think,
"Oh, man, this person's
not really trusting me." Even though
they weren't gonna be the vote, now they will be the vote
just because they're getting
a little bit too paranoid. PROBST:
Aysha, do you feel the same way?
That it can literally change like that?
Everything was fine, then somebody says the wrong
thing and everything shifts? Yeah, it can change
at the drop of a hat. Like, you could have
a conversation with a person, and an hour later
they're not being as reassuring. It's like, "Oh, okay,
maybe that may not be the plan. "Maybe that was just something
in the moment just to tell me. Maybe I should be worried." PROBST:
Kishan, the dangerous part of somebody feeling
on the outside is something as simple
as the Shot in the Dark or some other advantage
or idol in the game. Did you sense that there's someone
feeling on the outs today? I did not sense that, and
that's probably a misperception on my end, because, for me,
I'm strong to the core four. And you know, I want to go ahead and move forward
with whatever we believe in. -So...
-PROBST: Who's the core four? -I'm not gonna say.
-But there is four? -Maybe.
-PROBST: Teeny? TEENY:
I mean,
when he says "core four," you have no choice
but to believe him. It's interesting because people who aren't involved in the plan
have to know something. So you have to be talking
to everybody. And if that means that you feel
like you trust somebody enough to where you're locked in
with them, and you don't need to reassure
them as much, then there you go. Sol, that sounds like a message. If you're part of the core four,
the core four is saying, "Dude, come on,
we're good. Relax." SOL:
Yeah,
that's what it sounds like, um, but this is Survivor, and I'm trying to find out, is this, like, part of the game
where I'm going crazy, or is it, they're just having, like,
real conversations with people? You know what I'm saying?
And I hope I'm not going crazy. PROBST:
Kishan,
it's a fine line because, as Aysha was saying, you want to make sure
you're solid, but if you dip into the well
one more time, you might say the wrong thing. Do you worry about that as well? KISHAN:
Yes. It's so easy
to get tripped up. And that did complicate things, which is, I think,
what's causing this uneasiness,
because now we're just like, "Holy cow. How many
other different conversations "were happening that "I wasn't a part of or
someone else wasn't a part of? "Maybe if we just took
a step back "and kind of kept it
a bit more calm, maybe those feelings
wouldn't arise." Today felt like you're in
this trio of best friends. Like, you have a group chat.
You talk every day, right? Three people.
But then you're just walking. You know,
you're walking your dogs, and you look in a restaurant, and the other two
are having lunch. And you're like,
"Wait. They didn't put that "in the group chat.
Like, what's going on? "Like, I'm so confused. Do I go up?"
Because I'm a part of this. Like, I should feel welcome
to come up. Genevieve, Aysha's example
is straight out of real life. Sometimes
it's a misunderstanding. Sometimes there's more to it. Is that a relatable experience
for you out here? Yeah. You don't know
what is real and what is not and what's a bluff and
what is not and who's looking. Like, you know, Sol's making
eyes at Aysha across the back. And you don't know,
like, how much do I dial in on this or not? PROBST:
Even you just saying that
now lights up Teeny, who looks at Sol and says, "Why
are you making eyes at Aysha?" You're fighting
for a million dollars. This is Survivor right here. You're in the belly
of the beast right now. We're about to vote.
If you're not playing, it probably is you, and
it should be you going home. So, Kishan,
what's your take on this? All that cohesion
that we talked about? Yes, it's nice,
but it's honestly just a facade. And we pushed it off as long
as we could until we needed to. And at the end of the day,
we knew that one person's name
will be written down, and they will be voted off. And that's a harsh reality
that we all knew when we came in today. All right, we feel good to vote,
or do we need to talk more? I just want
to say one more thing. I don't want
to call anybody out, but I hope the person
that agreed to vote with me sticks to that. Otherwise, I know that I could
be at risk of going home, or an ally could be
at risk of going home. ♪ ♪ PROBST:
And on that note, it is time to vote.
Aysha, you're up. ♪ ♪ I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so. One second, Jeff. I got full faith in the people
that I have faith in, but I went on a journey
at an absolute perfect time, and, you know,
I was able to get an idol that's good
for one Tribal Council, so I'm gonna use it now, but
I don't think it's me tonight 'cause I got faith in the people
that I got faith in, and I'm just gonna ride
with that. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast

Need to bring me your torch. (sighs)
Yeah. That really hurts. I'm not gonna lie. Wow. Was it you, too, Sol? No. Aysha, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. -Good luck.
