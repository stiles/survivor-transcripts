    "transcript": "JEM: My heart's beating\n really superfast. It's a friggin' lockbox.\n It says, \"The location of the key\nwill remain a mystery until after your tribe loses\n a future immunity challenge.\" Oh, my God. PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... BHANU:\n Tiffany and Q -are really tight.\n-Amen. And Kenzie's a mastermind. LIZ:\n He tells us everything. It is a gold mine\n of information. (sobbing): I need a miracle. Q:\n Bhanu is a liability,\n but Kenzie is a threat. So I want Kenzie to go home. Oh, my God. -LIZ: Hey, Doc!\n-RANDEN: Hey, it's Jeff. PROBST:\nRanden, it's about your arm. Just being very cautious\nabout your health, we are pulling you\nfrom the game. Randen was pulled from the game, which means\nno Tribal Council tonight. (gasps) PROBST:\nNobody going home\nfrom this tribe. (laughing) Q:\n Kenzie got lucky. She has no idea how close she came\n to going home. \u266a \u266a I can't-I can't believe it. Believe it. I know. I am. We are lucky. For the first time. -For the first time, we're...\n-It took seven days.\nWe're lucky. I think this little break\n really could change the Yanu tribe's trajectory. You know,\nwe've been going like this. All we need is one little spike\nin the market, you know, that's it, to shoot back up. BHANU:\nGroup hug. -I love you guys.\n-I love y'all. -Yeah.\n-I love you. Second chance. We're not out of the race yet. This could be the turning point. We've got a good base, and now we've got\n a chance to build upon it. I'm feeling good about it. Why? I said something wrong. TIFFANY:\nWhat? I said,\n\"Kenzie's the mastermind here.\" I just... That's one thing I said. And they... they-they said, \"Are Tiff and Q, like, close?\" I was like,\n\"Yeah, they're close.\" There's nothing\nwrong in that, right? Is that close?\nIs that-is that bad? I kind of don't really\nwant them to know how close me and Q are,\n'cause then they're -gonna try to split us up.\n-But they always\nsee you guys like this. So they've asked me\nthat one question. I-I'm just, like,\nbeing so clear. So there's just, like... 'Cause then they're\ngonna try to break us up. That's all I said.\nAnd that's it. -Yeah. Yeah.\n-Mm. Huh?! Boy... If you can't realize that going to a journey\n to meet two other people from other tribes,\nand they're asking you questions about players on your tribe,\n that they're pumping you for information,\nyou are a liability. -He going over there\ntelling people that we close?\n-I-I can't. I can't. I-I can't. -There's no more\ngoing back to it.\n-Bro, like... Now, he put a target\non Kenzie back, and he put a target\non both of our back. -He got to go.\n-Yeah. TIFFANY:\n And I wonder what\n you said about yourself. I'm sure he's probably like,\n \"You know, I'm just on the bottom right now,\nand I'm on my way out the door.\" Probably made himself look\nlike some friggin' sob story. And everybody looks like\na big threat except for him. Yep. Done. TIFFANY:\n If I would have voted out\n Kenzie and kept Bhanu and then found out\n all this information, I just would have\njumped headfirst into the ocean. I'd have been so pissed. About the Kenzie thing? About all of it. Did I say something wrong? Q: Not only\n did he put a huge target on Kenzie's back, which I don't really mind. Now the target on my back\nis not only \"curious, young, \"he's athletic,\nhe's a physical threat. \"Oh, by the way,\nadd the fact that... he's a duo with Tiff.\" Oh, man. That \"yes\" had so much meaning. Ah, ... BHANU: I shouldn't\n have said that to them, but I said it in good faith\n because I wanted to be honest with my tribe. (groans) BHANU:\nThe target on Kenzie was on and\nwe were going to Tribal Council. Everything is gonna go\n according to the plan, and me just\nspilling everything out... (sighs) It just messed\nthe whole game for me. And he was like, \"Yeah, that's\nbecause she's the mastermind, and she's\nrunning the show over there.\" Bitch. Target number one,\ntwo and three-- me, you and Q. He just... Aah! Like, I'm so mad at him. -Are you dumb?\n-After we reamed him at Trib-- about the Jess Tribal? He's literally like a toddler.\nLike, when the oven is hot, and you're like,\n\"Don't touch the oven.\" And he does and then he cries. TIFFANY:\nWhy would you ever say that? -In Survivor... -'Cause he doesn't know\nhow to play Survivor. -And...\n-Why did he even come out here? He could have just gone camping. -Like, what was the point\nin him even...\n-Deadass. -If you want to win\na million hearts, go volunteer.\n-Oh, my God. I still want to win and I still want to stay\ntribe strong, but Bhanu -is a liability.\n -TIFFANY: What... a Looney Tune. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I need some help. If I'm taking any wrong steps, mis-miscalculations,\nplease help me. God, may Your blessings\n be upon us. Amen. He can sit there\nand pray all he wants. He's made his bed.\nHe got to lay in it. BHANU\n Yesterday, I really,\n really screwed up, and, um, I-I don't know\nwhat-what to do now. (praying in Sanskrit) So at the crack of the dawn,\n I said my Sanskrit mantras. (continues praying) I'm praying, and I just need\n a glimmer of hope. Om... KENZIE:\n Tree mail time. \"Fun little tests\nbookend this game. \"In between,\nthere's no time to waste. \"Winners are nourished\nby victory. For the losers,\nnot even a taste.\" -It's gonna be food!\n-It's food. Yay! VENUS: \"For the losers, not even a taste.\" -SODA: Our reward is food...\n-Food, food, food. Lord. Jesus. HUNTER:\nOf all the challenges to win... -It's this one.\n-This is the one. SODA:\n Oh, my God. We got tree mail today that said something\nabout being nourished and that we're gonna\ntaste something, and I'm like, \"Ah, a food reward,\" 'cause we're so hungry. -\u266a Get on your feet \u266a\n-(vocalizing) \u266a If you want to eat \u266a \u266a I'm in the mood\n to win some food \u266a \u266a And that's what Nami\n is gonna do \u266a \u266a Because it's morning time \u266a \u266a In Fiji... \u266a As a tribe,\n Randen leaving affects morale. It's our first real loss. \u266a On my mental... \u266a SODA:\n But we definitely\n have to forge ahead. I don't care how much it takes, 'cause I feel like\n I'm queen morale. I try to make people laugh\n and bring people together and do silly things\n that get us forward, because the thing is, we have\nto win 'cause we have to eat. (Tevin vocalizing) (Soda vocalizing) We love a swole,\ndramatic ending. \u266a Hey! \u266a MORIAH: \"Winners\n are nourished by victory. -For losers, not even a taste.\"\n-(excited chatter) (cheering) MORIAH:\n When we saw that we have a reward challenge coming up, our brains melted. We were like,\n\"We're finally going to able to maybe get some food.\" Look how much\na reward has really -upped our spirits.\n-(Maria chuckles) Do you all think that people,\nthey're gonna be like, \"How silly is it\nthat these people have not found an idol yet?\" -JEM: Oh, my God.\n-CHARLIE: Yes. They're gonna be like, \"They're\njust, like, hanging out.\" JEM: Right now,\n nobody knows that I found the Beware Advantage first and that I actually\n have replanted it. I want someone else to find it to kind of send them\n on a wild-goose chase to basically\n get the scent off of me. -MARIA: We should\nhave something by now.\n-MORIAH: Yeah. MARIA:\nJem, you looked in here, right? JEM:\nI did not. Every time that\nwe would go to the water well, I can see it. But my job is to act\nlike it's not there. I was like, \"Yeah, I think\nit might be hanging somewhere.\" MARIA:\nWait, guys. CHARLIE:\nDid you just actually find it? MARIA:\nI literally\njust looked right there. CHARLIE:\nOh, my God. -TIM: Is that it?\n-Yes, it says Beware Advantage. And then Maria spotted it. And I'm like, \"Aah!\" (laughs) And I threw it, 'cause I'm like,\n\"It's the Beware Advantage.\" -If you open it it's yours.\n-Well, we're just gonna peek. We're just gonna have a look.\n\"Beware Advantage. \"If you take it it's yours\nand you must do what it says. Otherwise, leave it.\" MARIA: It's a little kumbaya to, like, be idol-hunting\n as a group, but... I'm gonna go for it, because\nwithout taking this risk, there's no way I'm gonna get that extra advantage,\n if it is one. -Let's go.\n-MORIAH: Oh, my God, Maria. -Oh, dear God!\n-Let's go, Lieutenant Mom. Drumroll. (imitating drumroll) What do you got to do, Maria? It says... CHARLIE:\nOh, boy. -(Jem chuckles)\n-MARIA: Yeah.\n-TIM: It's the same. JEM:\n The hardest part for me\n is for me to keep a straight face, 'cause I want\nto just laugh so loud. Everybody's\n digging under the tree. They're going crazy,\nand they're gonna find nothing. MARIA:\nI'm getting bitten. Oh, my God.\nThere's so many ants in here. -CHARLIE: Oh, God.\n-MARIA: That's the Beware? -JEM: Oh, those are giant ants.\n-MORIAH: Oh, those are... -Oh, those are\nthe dangerous big black ants.\n-MARIA: Yeah, I know. (screams) -Ow.\n-MORIAH: Be careful.\nThose ants are huge. MARIA:\nThe ants are massive. JEM:\n So now there are these giant black ants\nthat started stinging everybody. (screams) -Beware, you're\ngonna get attacked by ants?\n-CHARLIE: Do you want me... JEM:\n In Survivor, your job\n is to play as hard as you can, but it's also okay to have\nsome fun while you're doing it. Who would have thunk?\nGroup idol hunt, eh? JEM:\nWe were just talking about... What? Ah... -MORIAH: Fake idol, yeah.\n-CHARLIE: That'd be wild. -MARIA: That would be funny.\n-That-that would be. Finding a Beware Advantage,\n replanting it, have somebody else\ndig up a tree. Like, that's the fun part. -MORIAH: We all ready?\n-JEM: We'll be back. And my hope is that I'm able\n to pin it on someone else. Yeah, let's go. So I'm having fun on Survivor. So that's exciting. (laughs) -TIM: Great work, Maria.\n-Yeah. Wi th a ll t he se H il to n Ho no rs Po in ts , I ca n st ay f or f re e? Mmmhmm. At the Waldorf Astoria\nin the Maldives? What about the Canopy\nin Paris? Mmmhmm. Hilton Honors, babe! When you want points\n that can take you anywhere, It Matters Where\n You Stay. Hilton. For the Stay. Fe el in g Cl ar it in C le ar is l ik e. .. \u266a\u266a [cat meow] \u2501Is she? Letting her imagination\nrun wild even though she has allergies. Yeah. A na ti on al t as te t es t de te rm in ed America's favorite\nboneless wings, Applebee's won. How about that? We don't even have\nwing in our name. Get them now\nfor just 50 cents. Only at Applebee's. Wa nn a kn ow a S ec re t? More than just\nmy armpits stink. That's why I use Secret Whole Body\ndeodorant... everywhere. 4 out of 5 gynecologists would recommend\nWhole Body deodorant, which gives you\n72 hour odor protection from your pits to your- (SFX: deoderant being sprayed) Secret Whole Body deodorant. \u266a \u266a Treating schizophrenia\n without a daily pill may seem impossible... But what if there was a path\n to treatment just twice a year? \u266a\u266a It's time for\n INVEGA HAFYERA\u00ae. \u266a\u266a The only long-acting injection that helps continuously\n control schizophrenia symptoms for up\n to six months with one dose. Before starting, you must be adequately treated\n with a similar shorter-term injection for at least\n four months. INVEGA HAFYERA\u00ae\n is not for everyone. Elderly dementia patients have an increased risk of\n death or stroke. Call your doctor if you have uncontrollable\n muscle movements, as these can become permanent. Or if you have a high fever,\n stiff muscles and confusion... Other risks include\n increased cholesterol, weight gain, heart rate\n and high blood sugar which can lead\n to coma or death. These are not all the serious\n side effects. INVEGA HAFYERA\u00ae. Imagine what's ahead\n when you leave schizophrenia pills behind. \u266a\u266a \u266a \u266a Come on in. All right, Jeff! -(laughs)\n-CHARLIE: Good morning. Good morning. Let's go! Nice. Oh. PROBST:\nGetting your first look\nat the new Nami tribe. Randen was pulled from the game. -Oh.\n-Oh, man. Oh, my... Hi. All right,\nso just to catch everybody up, Randen was suffering\nwith an issue in his arm. It was a pinched nerve,\nbut our medical team was very concerned\nabout possible long-term damage, so we had to make\nthe tough decision to end Randen's journey in favor\nof his long-term health, which means\nthere was no Tribal Council. Nobody from Yanu went home. That tribe stays intact. TIFFANY:\nThanks, guys. Shall we get\nto today's reward challenge? -Yes.\n-(whoops) PROBST:\n All right,\n for today's challenge, you're gonna paddle your boat\n in from the ocean, collecting a key along the way. Once you reach the shore, you'll use that key\n to unlock four rings. Each player is then\n responsible for getting one of those rings\n up and off that pole. Once you have all four rings,\n you'll dig under a log and race to toss those four\n rings back onto another pole. First two tribes\nto finish win reward. -Want to know\nwhat you're playing for?\n-Yes. Food. Show me food. You want food? You got food. LIZ:\nPB&J! (all exclaiming) Told you. PROBST:\nFirst tribe to finish, ten decent-sized fresh fish delivered to your camp, along with a bamboo cooker\nand a diagram for how to use it. Second tribe to finish, smaller but just as appetizing. -Five decent-sized fish\nwill be delivered to your camp.\n-Yeah, let's go. All right, sit-outs. Nami, you're sitting\none person out. Who's it gonna be? Venus gonna sit out for Nami. Siga, you're\nsitting two people out. Who's gonna sit out? -Yeah.\n-Me and Moriah. PROBST:\nMoriah and Ben will sit out. All right, sit-outs,\ntake a spot on the bench. Everybody else,\ngive you a minute to strategize. -We'll get it on. Let's do it.\n-(whooping) PROBST:\nAll right, for reward. Survivors ready? -Yeah.\n-Go! -One, two, three.\nOne, two, three...\n-TIFFANY: All right, let's go. You're racing to get that key. BHANU:\nOne, two, three. Great. -Okay, stop, stop.\n-Q: Go. BHANU:\nYeah, keep going, keep going. Siga! Nami! PROBST:\nSiga gets there first. Tim takes a big dump and flips it over. MARIA: Let's go. Let's go. PROBST:\nYou got to flip it back! -Get it, Liz. Go. Jump.\n-Be careful, Liz. Be careful. -Be careful, girl. Be careful.\n-PROBST: Nami at their key. -Kenzie.\n-You got it, girl. PROBST:\nYanu with their key. Tim falls off again. And again, for a third time. -Yes. Let's go.\n-PROBST: Nami has their key. Kenzie working\non the key for Yanu. TIFFANY:\nAll right, let's turn. PROBST:\nTim still struggling to get the key for Siga. -MARIA: Yeah, just like that...\n-CHARLIE: Yeah, that'll work. TEVIN:\nRow. -Row.\n-PROBST: Here comes Nami. -Here comes Yanu.\n-TEVIN: Row.

PROBST:\nAnd here comes Siga\nwith their key. HUNTER:\nGo. Keep rolling. Once you hit the sand,\nyou're good, clip in. (overlapping chatter) Now, you got to clip back in.\nGet your rope. TIFFANY:\nThere you go. There you go. PROBST:\nYou're good, Yanu.\nGet your rope. That's good, Nami. Head up. VENUS:\nYes. You guys are killing it. You're in the lead right now,\nyou guys. PROBST:\nYanu, are they close enough? Yes, they are. -TIFFANY: Okay, we're good.\nLet's go.\n-All right, let's go. -PROBST: Hunter\nunlocking the rings for Nami.\n-The key is to throw it -as hard as you can, right?\n-Do it, Hunter. (grunts) That's it. PROBST:\nHe nails it with his first shot. Hunter has\nthe first ring for Nami. -(grunts)\n-PROBST: It's now Tevin. LIZ:\nOne more time. Siga trying\nto make up lost time. Big reward on the line.\nYou got to lock in now. -You're good, Siga.\n-TIM: Keys, keys, keys. PROBST:\nYanu has their rings free. Here comes Tiff now.\nShe's gonna give it a go. Tiff has her ring.

Three, two, one. -There you go.\n-You're right there, Maria. Good job! Come on. Yanu is through.\nYou're good, Yanu. Start throwing those rings.\nIt's gonna be Tiff. Yanu with a huge lead right now. VENUS:\nKeep it in the middle.\nStay calm. Yes! -That's what I'm talking about.\n-Liz has it for Nami. You're good. Start digging. -BEN: Maria!\n-PROBST: It's now Maria\nfeeling the pressure. -TIM: Just like that...\n-You got this. It's okay. PROBST:\nEverybody else has a ring. Maria, the last person left. CHARLIE:\nWe got tons of time here. PROBST:\nShe's got\nto get it over that pole or Siga cannot\ncontinue in this challenge. Two tribes are gonna win reward. Yanu would like\nto be first for once.

We're looking for one more. Maria's got\nto get it off the pole -in order for Siga\nto move ahead.\n-Come on! -You got this, Maria.\n-TIM: There you go.

All right,\nYanu, congratulations. -Your first win of the season.\n-LIZ: Wow. -SODA: Yeah, Yanu!\n-KENZIE: Thank you.\nThanks, y'all. -Wow.\n-You're okay. Don't cry. PROBST:\nAll right, Yanu,\nyou've earned ten fresh fish, good size,\ndelivered at your camp. But I know what you're thinking. You don't have flint,\nso you have the option to trade this reward\nfor an earlier one. So if you wanted to trade\nfor the large tool kit and the large tarp and give\nup the fish, you can do that. Those fish will not\ndo us any good right now. So the large tarp and tool kit. Large tool kit, large tarp will\nbe waiting for you back at camp. -Hopefully that will\nchange your lives quite a bit.\n-LIZ: Yeah. Hell yeah. Nami, five fresh fish will be -waiting for you back at camp.\n-Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you. PROBST:\nNami, grab your stuff,\nhead out and enjoy those fish. -TEVIN: Thank you, Jeff.\n-Thank you.\n-We sure will. PROBST:\nSiga, got nothing for you.\nGrab your stuff, head out. Yanu, grab your stuff, head out. Well done. Welcome to the game. KENZIE: We didn't only win, we demolished. We beat them by a landslide, which is the opposite of what's been happening to us\n this entire time. It's, like,\nthe momentum that we needed. Our core four is finally\n getting it together. And that is why\nyou never give up on Survivor. Randen's out. Yanu gets new life\nand their first win. Sound fun?\nApply to be on Survivor.

LIZ: When we get back to camp, there were five\nstunningly gorgeous different fish waiting for us. A fish a piece! -Yes!\n-A fish a piece. A fish a piece. LIZ:\n And for me, I am allergic to all the fruit here\n and the coconut. They cause\na real throat reaction. So I know my body needs protein. I know I'm getting depleted. My mouth\nis salivating right now. -I just want to get out here\n'cause I'm very excited.\n-Where's the fish? I really wanted\nto cut and clean the fish because my dad\nshowed me how to do it, and I haven't done it since I did it with my dad. \u266a \u266a I had been trying to go fishing\nwith him for about three years, but I was\n so busy with my career and I kept being like,\n \"Oh, I can't do it.\" You know,\n\"I can't do it. I can't do it.\" And then the time to do it\nis eternally past. My dad passed away about ten months ago. And so I didn't get to fish with\nhim that one last time, so... It was just nice to do something\n today that was just, like... Dad's right here. We had a very\n powerful relationship. When I didn't have a car, he gave me\n his one and only car, so that I could get\n back and forth to high school. And he had no transportation. And he called me\n every single day just to say, \"Hey, how are you doing?\" One of the hardest parts\nabout him passing was that, the day after he passed,\nmy phone didn't ring. -SODA: Wow!\n -LIZ: Wow. We ready. -Beautiful.\n-TEVIN: Here they are. -SODA: Aw.\n-Um, my dad taught me\nhow to do this. And this is, I think, the first\ntime I've done it without him. -But, like, I did it.\n-LIZ: Oh, wow. SODA:\nThat's the way to fish, baby! TEVIN:\n So I was filled with pride\n to know that something my daddy taught me\n is coming into play right now. And I'm about to give\n this thing that I have crafted to these people who need it, which is what he was all about. So he lives on. (gasps) Wow. -Fantastico!\n-We did it! We finally won something. (singsongy): First place.\nWho would have thought? That's crazy. We really\nbodied that whole challenge. KENZIE:\nYeah, we did. TIFFANY:\n We blew those other teams\n out today. Oh, that's real big. But this win\n was bigger than us just winning a tarp and some tools. This could definitely be\n a turning point for our tribe. If we could really\n get our stuff together, we might\nnot have to lose anymore. Go to your right. Go to my... Opposite side of the girls\nright now. I'm exactly at\nthe opposite side of the girls. -Go to the other side\nof the shelter.\n-KENZIE: Go that way. Onto the girls' side. TIFFANY:\nNo, we-- You are on the girls'\nside. Go to the other side. Q:\n I know that if we go\n to Tribal next, Bhanu is the one\n that's going home. But if he's going to be around, I have to make sure that Bhanu is the best player that he can be. Just stay in the moment,\nstay in the current. But I think there's so much that Bhanu don't understand\nand don't know about the game of Survivor. We have to fix\nyour social and strategic game to where it's not a liability. So what I'm doing is taking\n my time to actually train him, and that is my job as the coach. We're having coaching sessions. Hopefully I can teach him how to keep his mouth shut. You need to be thinking\nabout every moment. From here on out, start playing\nconversations in your head. In this game, you have a lot of people\nwho want to manipulate you. They ask you questions\nand they buddy you up. -Mm.\n-And you feel like, \"Oh, my God.\nI got to give something back.\" No, the ... you don't. My training with Bhanu\n is training his emotions, training his speech. So you don't want me\nto talk strategy at all? Teaching him techniques to use in general conversations\nwith others. Tonight, who you voting for? I don't know who I'm voting for. -Would you vote Tiff tonight?\n-Oh, yeah, sure. So you're voting Tiff? So that right there\nwas a bit too much, 'cause you jumped on it\ntoo quick. Oh... Q:\n And I'm teaching him how to talk at Tribal. So, Bhanu, what's going on at your camp?\nWe're merged. This is Jeff talking to you. We're vibing with everybody. You know, it's-it's cool. And when you say \"we,\"\nwho is we, Bhanu? Everybody.\nI'm vibing with all of them. Perfect, Bhanu. BHANU:\nIs that Jeff or coach talking? Oh, okay. Q:\n I'm not very optimistic about his approach\n going forward, but if the little bit\n that I can teach him can help, I'm going to continue to try. What did you learn? Tell me. Ask me the same question, coach. -KENZIE: Just-just tell me...\n-No, just tell her\nwhat you learned. BHANU:\nSo, this is what I learned. When Jeff asks, like, \"Hey, Bhanu.\nSo what's going on?\" I would be like,\n\"Things are good, you know? We're all\nvibing with each other.\" I'm glad you're practicing. I want to practice\nwith you, too. We'll have more sessions. -I'll have more.\n-Mm-hmm. I'll-I'll have it\nwith Kenzie, too. -Kenzie?\n-Yeah? I am helping you. Oh, no, no, no.\nYes, you are now. -I will help you.\n-Yes. I just want to enjoy our win\nfor, like, five minutes. -I want to not\ntalk about strategy.\n-Oh, sorry. I'm just gonna walk away. You have\nthe patience of a saint. I snapped at Bhanu because you are probably\n15 years older than me. Like, I... shouldn't have\nto help you play Survivor. And, of course, Bhanu is like,\n \"I'll just walk away.\" I'm like, \"Okay. Go.\" I'm over it.\n I'm over babying Bhanu. It's so annoying. BEN:\nLet's start with the positives. This was\njust a reward challenge. And I want to say that even in the face of all the insanity, you guys were still a team and I couldn't\nbe more proud of y'all. So, you know, Maria, I know you feel like\nthe weight is on your shoulders because it was\nthat whole situation. But I still did it. -You still did it.\n-Yeah. But, yeah, also, every single\nperson out there believed in you and trusts you and doesn't\nput any ounce of blame on you. JEM:\nAnd we don't even-- -It's just fish, Maria.\nIt's not that big a deal.\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. MARIA:\nYou know what? As immigrants, success was survival\nfor my family. And so we grew up where we had to be perfect. And so I never wanted to fail. So many times I wondered, like,\n\"Am I enough? Am I good enough?\" You know? And this was, like,\na big, big place... to fail\nin front of a lot of people. Growing up, our parents\n wanted so much for us. They came from Lebanon\n to this country and worked so hard. And so, you know,\nwe-we were pushed hard. We were pushed with this\n sort of fire in us to succeed. And when there were moments in life\nwhen I didn't, you know, I was hard on myself. What I've worked on\nthe last couple years is shedding the shame...\n(sniffles) the shame and the guilt\nbehind not succeeding. And just knowing\nthat it's a moment in time, and that doesn't define\nwho I am. BEN:\nListen, Maria, you're gon-- I know you're\ntaking this loss hard, but it's gonna\nbe a lesson for you in more of that\nletting go of shame. -Yeah.\n-BEN: You know what I'm saying? So either way,\nwhether we had the fish or not, -it's gonna be a positive.\n-OTHERS: Yeah. -BEN: All right?\n-Thank you. (Charlie whoops) Let's not forget,\nwe also have a Beware Advantage we can look for, too. -Yeah.\n-All right? Because of Maria. -All right?\n-CHARLIE: Yeah. JEM:\nThat was good. CHARLIE: This Beware Advantage,\n it drives me nuts because Maria and I\ndidn't get to control this potential really valuable piece of information. -MORIAH: Ready to do this?\n-MARIA: Diggy, diggy. CHARLIE:\n She got so excited that she told\nthe whole damn tribe and, all of a sudden, this whole big group effort is going on. That's reason one\nto be frustrated. I mean, this is insane. This is under a tree. This is, like,\nwe're digging in a tree's roots. Reason two is we can't freaking find the thing. We've dug so far\nunder this crazy tree. -This is a serious hole we dug.\n-This is, like, unreal. CHARLIE:\n And there's nothing.\n So what the heck is going on? Because\n the next most likely option is that someone\nplanted it there. This feels, like, comical. We've dug out as far\nas you can go under the spot. So, like, where is it? Either that\nor somebody's being sneaky -and found it in another tree.\n-MARIA: Someone-- Exactly. BEN:\nJeff, where is this thing, dude? Jeff don't lie. A few fundamentals in Survivor: One: Jeff will never lie to you. Two: Jeff will never\ngive you anything impossible. TIM:\nIf Jeff put this in the tree,\nhe's good, 'cause this is absurd. MORIAH:\n So maybe Jeff is not the reason\nwe're digging there. JEM:\n It's great. My game is going the way\nI intended it to go, 'cause I wanted the suspicion\n to be off of me -and onto someone else. -Ah. What's the suspicion? MORIAH: We're thinking\nTim might've planted it. JEM:\n'Cause, Maria, nobody else was, like, going as hard\nas he was. He's overcompensating to take all the suspicions\noff of him. I mean, that's\na massive possibility. JEM:\n The idea that Tim might\nhave the hidden immunity idol-- like, that's what I wanted. I came to play Survivor, and I'm playing as hard as I can\nwith what I'm given.

Liberty. \u266a Baby: \u266a Liberty. \u266a \u266a \u266a People want to, like, chill,\nlounge, and, uh, you know, Bhanu is a stupid ass. And so, the stupid ass\nis gonna go and do stupid ... I left the camp because,\n all of a sudden, Kenzie-- she just, like,\n snapped at me. I'm being treated like...\nnobody. They're not respecting me. I'm so stupid. I had so much power in the game\nand now I'm like a puppet, and they're the puppet masters. They're like, \"Do this, do that,\ndo this, do that.\" And this is what I get. I've seen all the seasons\n of Survivor as a superfan, but when it comes\n to social skills, it's still not sinking in me. Everyone feels like\n I'm a dumb dumbo. \"Oh, we need to teach him how to walk, how to talk.\" So I became a robot,\nso I'm no longer a Bhanu. I'm just, like, you know, I... They're like puppeteers\nand I'm a puppet. It feels... it...\nI-I don't like that. Take your moment. I'll go apologize.\nI don't want him to spiral. I snapped at Bhanu, and then, because I know he's emotional,\nI know that I have\nto go run damage control so that Bhanu doesn't think\neverybody's mad at him again. Bhanu? I'm, like, one foot\n in front of the other just trying to find this man\n so I can apologize... Bhanu? ...when any other person\n would be like, \"Maybe I shouldn't\nenlist her to, like, \"train me on how to do the thing we came out here\nto do right now.\" But we have to make Bhanu\n feel good because if we go on a winning streak\nand we take Bhanu to the merge, we need him\nto stay loyal to Yanu. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Like, we are a tribe. We want to keep our numbers. We need you\nto be successful at Tribal. Like, I'm here to help you. -Thank you. Thank you.\n-'Cause we need you. And I know it's hard. I feel so bad that\nhere is this old child-man -that needs help.\n-It's okay. I love you.\nAll right, we'll get through it. BHANU:\nKenzie came to me and said like, \"I really... I apologize.\" Makes me feel better. And I was like,\n \"Okay, you know what? Uh, bygones, bygones.\" Thank you for understanding.\nCool. BHANU:\n I can take some lessons. Like, you know,\n I know it's very important for my game,\n for everyone's game. If so many people\n are putting work into me, I think I need\nto put some effort in it. -LIZ: Perfect.\n-TEVIN: There you go. All right, I'm gonna wash shirt,\npants, socks. LIZ:\nIf anybody sees some dirty orange underwear... -TEVIN: Ooh.\n-SODA: Right there.\n-...holler at me. I haven't\nwashed my shorts at all, and then these two undies. I feel like\n my game's going pretty well. There's five people\nin this tribe. I personally feel like\nthere's a solid three with Hunter, Tevin, and I,\n which leaves, on the minority, Liz and Venus. LIZ:\nI found my underwear! Yay! But you have a lot of downtime when you win because\nyou do not have to go to Tribal. Guys, I just realized something. Those two little triangles\nat the bottom of our flag look like slices of pizza. Even though I'm pretty good\n at just being, like, kumbaya, your head has to constantly\nbe in this game. You know, I like\nto check in and stuff, see where people's heads are at. You know I really want\nto connect with you. I want to stay connected to you. And you are\nmy confidant out here. Like, it's 100% me, Liz, you, Tevin and Hunter. There's nothing\nthat this fab five cannot do. If you're even out of the game\nfor a second and you get stuck, that's it. You will be out like a light.\n You'll be gone. -Like, what...\n-I feel like she knows that, like, we are tight, and I feel like that three going\ninto the merge is gonna be super powerful three. And I know this is tight,\nso I'm not worried. Hmm. Soda is a social butterfly,\n as am I. However, she's playing the game\na little too hard for me. -Soda. -TEVIN: There's moments\n where I'm watching her, and it seems like she's having little whisper moments\n behind my back. -We're all vibing, but...\n-Yeah. I'm down for individual vibes\nbecause I love everyone. TEVIN:\n I'm just a little worried\n that she may be playing me just as\n she's playing everyone else. And it breaks my heart to say it\nbecause I do have a connection with her\n that is so deep. But the target in which\n I am seeking to hit now is shifting. And so now\n I need to be the one to get into everyone's head\n and plant seeds. For tribe strength,\nI would rather get rid of Venus than Soda, but you already know that Soda is playing a real... game. I would rather\nkeep our game alive and have a weaker tribe than... So are you saying, just making it seem like\n it's Venus, and then we just\n switch it to Soda? HUNTER:\n I think that's\n the safest 'cause... TEVIN:\n 'Cause she wouldn't expect it? HUNTER:\n She wouldn't expect it. Yeah. I actually have wanted Soda out\nfor a while because she's my competition\nfor closeness with Tevin. So whenever Tevin\n started expressing doubt in Soda, you know, that sounds great to me.\nLet's do it, right? I just want to ask, if we have\nto go to Tribal Council, how do you feel if we were...\nhad to vote Soda? Because my gut is telling me, \"Tevin, you got\nto play the game.\" And if playing the game\nmeans that I have to get somebody out of this game who I think\nis manipulating everyone... To be honest with you,\nI think she's the one to beat. This is great news\n for me because I really have this feeling that if Soda makes it\n to the merge, Soda is on her way\n to final Tribal Council, and I cannot have that. Yeah. TEVIN:\n As far as we're concerned, me, Hunter and Liz\n are on board. Like, Soda got to Go-da. Pa in h it s fa st . So get relief fast. Only Tylenol Rapid Release\nGels have laser drilled holes.

Yanu with an opportunity\nto win it right here. Can he do it? No. PROBST:\nFor the win. Let's go! Siga! PROBST:\nAnd he's got it. Siga wins immunity, sending Yanu back\nto Tribal Council, where the fourth person\nwill be voted out of this game. (cheering) Nami, congratulations again. Immunity is yours. Once again,\nnobody going home from Nami. Enjoy your ceremonial\nleap off of the deck. (whoops) Swim out to your boat. That's what victory looks like\nin the water. Siga, congratulations again.

It's not the end\nof the game for us. (chuckles) BHANU:\n Yeah, all three of them-- they're having\n a conversation there. Never once, they talk to me. Never once\n they include me in anything. What are we gonna do\nabout Bhanu this afternoon? TIFFANY:\nI ain't doing nothing\nabout Bhanu this afternoon. It's just the frustration\nof constantly making somebody feel better\nabout the things -that they've done wrong to you.\n-KENZIE: All right. \"It's okay, you put a target\non my back. It's okay.\" \"It's okay, you lied to me.\" No, it's not okay.\nIt's not okay. BHANU:\n The vote is already decided. You know who you're voting. The one person who doesn't\nhave a vote today-- me. Ugh! But it's okay. I need to look for the idol. I need to look for the idol.\nGod, please help me. One thing is for sure--\n I am not going home tonight. If I can find the immunity idol, I can change the course\n of the game. (groans) Jeff, where did you\nput the idol? I'm digging deep here. \"Dig deep,\" he says. \"Dig deep.\" There should be some marker,\nsomething. If I have to climb\n Mount Everest, I will do it. God is listening. Like, today is the day.\n You need to help me. Help me, help me, help me,\nhelp me, help me. ...Jeff hid another idol\non this island?\n-Bruh. -The best he could do\nis save himself\n-That's it. with an idol that he might find, which he won't,\n'cause I have it. Where is this damn idol?! I searched, and now here I am. No vote, no agency. No...\nI can't do Shot in the Dark. Nothing! Wow! What a plan, man. What a plan. You okay? I'm not. Here. I'm mad at myself\nand I'm mad at Him. If this is what You wanted,\nif You wanted to end my story so soon, You shouldn't have put me\non Survivor in the first place. I'm so sorry, Bhanu. I've given it my all\nfor this game. Ugh! (sighs, sniffles) I'm so mad. I'm so mad. Oh. (sniffling) What can I do? Can you find me an idol? Tiff, you need\nto help me to... Please? -No. Please, Bhanu. No.\n-Please, Tiff. Please. Get up off your knees.\nWhat the hell are you doing? -No, I will not. I will not.\n-Ah, bro, please. -Tiff, you need to help me.\nYou know...\n-No. Get up. First of all,\nI'm not gonna talk to you if you're on your knees.\nI'm not gonna do that. -I need you to stand up.\n-Tiff. All right. I'm gonna\nkeep it honest with you. I'm gonna\nwrite your name tonight. I'm just being 100% honest.\nI am writing your name tonight. Can I-can I ask you what...\nthe reason behind that? -Yes. Yes.\n-Please. I feel like I can't trust you. I'm sorry that, you know,\nit has to end like this, but I hope that\nyou can respect the fact that I'm at least\nbeing honest with you. -Gotcha.\n-Can I have a hug? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry\nI screwed it up for us. It's fine, Bhanu.\nDon't be sorry to me. It's fine. (sighs) This is it for me. Nine days is what... ...is written for Bhanu. I have to just accept it. Namaste. Thanks to the island. Thanks to everything here. I realize that honesty\nhas no meaning in this game. A momentary truth caused... so much. I learned a lesson a hard way,\n that, you know, five seconds of my honesty\n ruined my game. That's how hard this game is. But guess what? I figured that I'm such\n an emotional person. I'm a very good person. I'm a loyal person,\n I'm an honest person. And that's what\n my journey's been. I am going home tonight. But tonight, you know what? I'm gonna tell my story because they still\n don't know my story. And I'm so glad that I got\n a chance to play Survivor. It's not about\n the million dollars. All I wanted to do\n is win a million hearts. My m ot he r us ed t o te ll m e a st or y. Of a demon king, and his army. They brought terror\nto the land.

I'd like to go back, since we didn't get to\nhave Tribal last time, and talk about the journey. Bhanu, you were selected\nto go on that journey. How'd that go? I went on this journey and, um, I lost my vote. Not only that,\nbut I revealed that Q and Tiff, when I asked, like, are they working together,\nI said like, \"Yes.\" And then I also said, like, you know, Kenzie\nis a good game player. PROBST:\nTiff, did you ask Bhanu what his motive was\nin giving away this information? TIFFANY:\nYes. I don't know if I've got an actual answer, but it seemed like\nhe didn't understand that by revealing\nthat information, he was putting a target\non all three of us. Like, I just don't think\nhe understood in that moment that he was getting played. PROBST:\nSo, Bhanu, is it that\nyou want to play that way or is part of it figuring out how to play Survivor and\nyou're still figuring it out? Jeff, the first\nsix days has been... Like, I'm not clicking,\nlike how to play the game. Sixth day,\nthe moment it clicked, and then, I spilled the beans\nto my Tribemates. So when I'm trying\nto get the game, the game took over,\nand I dug my grave so deep, I couldn't come out of it. PROBST:\nSo I'm getting a sense that... You're already nodding.\nYou finish. What was I gonna say? That Bhanu\nis going home tonight. -Is that what's happening?\n-Yes. I told Bhanu straight up,\nI'm writing that name down. -Yeah.\n-Yeah.\n-I have to write his name. And Bhanu, you don't have a\nvote, which means you can't play -the Shot in the Dark.\n-No. PROBST:\nIt requires a vote to sacrifice. And this would then\nmake me think that you've all talked about\nidols, and you don't have one. I've searched nine days, Jeff, for an idol, and I've done everything,\nbut I don't have anything. I don't have a vote,\nI-I don't have an idol. I don't have alliances. I screwed up this game big-time. Well, it's rare\nwhen this happens, but I find it intoxicating because there's\nno deception happening. You're not trying\nto blindside somebody. You've all been honest\nwith Bhanu. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: Honest. The word of Bhanu's whole time\nout here-- honesty. So, Bhanu,\nwhat is your Survivor journey? -What has it been?\n-Jeff, the reason why I'm on this show is because I want to share my story. I told them that\nI had a very good life, but that's a lie. (laughs) I was born into poverty\nto a teenage mother, and was abandoned\nby my maternal father when I was three months old. -And where were you?\n-I was in India. After a few years,\nmy mom got married, moved to a different city, and I\nwas living with my grandparents. And can you describe\na little bit -what poverty is like\nin India for you?\n-BHANU: Yes. So, the poverty\nis just like the camp. -That was my house in India.\n-PROBST: Literally? -Like, a thatched roof?\n-A thatched roof, yes. And that's how I grew up.\nI grew up literally on streets. But I learned to be honest\nand help each other, and that's how we all survived. I put in a lot of effort,\nand I am the first one in my entire family\nto graduate from high school, first one\nto have a graduate degree, first one to actually move to United States. And I also found my partner. So, all these things. So, the reason why I wanted\nto be on Survivor is because there's so many Bhanus\nstill out there, still living in poverty. So all the Bhanus\nout there, listen. There is always hope,\nand you can move mountains. And if I can\ncome from that place, a lot of people can also do it. But, unfortunately, this is how it... it's ending, so, it's on me. Thank you so much\nfor this opportunity, and thank you, tribe. -Thank you for\nsharing that with us.\n-Yeah. Yeah. Q:\nYou know, Bhanu, I want you\nto understand, brother, you've done a great job with the man\nyou've become today. And the man that you were\nin our tribe showed us that, man, we could count on you\nfor a lot of things. PROBST:\nYou know, Bhanu,\none time you said to me, I am your guru, -which I took as a compliment.\n-Yes, sir. But also, remind yourself you're your own guru. What you've done\nwith your life is remarkable. And I say this all the time. The game of Survivor is about the adventure, putting yourself\nin this environment to see what you're capable of, and that's what\nyou've been doing. You won my heart, Bhanu, -all of our hearts.\n-Mine, too. Seriously. All right, Bhanu,\nwhen you're ready. Bhanu, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Thanks for being here. Love you, Bhanu.
