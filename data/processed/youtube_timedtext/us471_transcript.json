    "transcript": "\u266a \u266a GABE:\nI want to be the very first head on the Mount Rushmore\n of the new era. AYSHA:\nI am ready to forge my own path. ROME:\n I'm 100% gonna be writing\nmy own Survivor story out here. CAROLINE:\n Listen, I am either gonna blaze my own path out here or\nI'm gonna burn down this island. SAM:\n I think I am dangerous\n in Survivor. I have what it takes,\n physically, but I'm versatile enough to fit\ninto different groups of people. You don't find a guy\n who looks like me be super unsuspecting, right? It's often the people that say,\n\"Oh, I'm a... I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing.\" I'm a wolf in wolf's clothing. \u266a \u266a AYSHA:\n I march to the beat\n of my own drum. And no matter how nerdy it is, these are the things\n I love in life. But I don't do anything\nunless I'm gonna succeed at it. (whooping) 'Cause I just don't like losing. I look like somebody\n who wouldn't hurt a fly, but they don't know,\nlike, I have a flyswatter in my back pocket. (laughs) KYLE:\n Growing up,\n life was a struggle, man. I spent five years in foster care,\nover 26 different homes I lived in before\n I would graduate high school. I could have just flipped over\n and laid on my back, but I didn't. Life dealt me the recipe\n for disaster, and I baked\na ... brownie with it. PROBST:\n These 18 strangers will be abandoned\n in the islands of Fiji. TIYANA:\n I am the first native\n Hawaiian to play Survivor. I want to show that Hawaii can roll\nwith the big dogs. (howling) PROBST:\n They must learn to adapt\n or they'll be voted out. JON:\n I am sure that I have friends\n and family watching this right now. And I'm pretty confident\n that I know what they want for me out of this experience. They want me to suffer. PROBST:\nIn the end, only one will remain to claim\n the million-dollar prize. ANIKA:\n I'm gonna play hard. I might get a little evil.\n Who knows? (cackling) SUE: When I win Survivor, my final words will be,\n \"I'm 59, and I beat all your asses.\" Who will have what it takes\nto outwit, outplay and outlast\nall the rest? This is Survivor 47. \u266a \u266a -(laughing, whooping)\n-(clapping) You're here. -Oh, my God.\n-Oh, my gosh. TK: I would say, looking\n at my fellow contestants, uh, I see a million dollars, man.\nLike, I really don't think\n I see anybody on here who can do anything with me,\n to be honest. So, I'm ready to go. All right.\nWelcome to Survivor 47. (whooping) -It's crazy.\n-PROBST: So, every season of Survivor starts the same way, with the forming\nof a new community. That's what's happening\nright now. Take a look around. This is gonna be your community for the next 26 days. And the reason community has always been the foundation of this social experiment\nwe've been doing for 24 years is because humans\nhave always craved community. And I get it. If you're at home\nwatching Survivor, you could say\n\"Ah, it doesn't fully jibe. \"I mean, they're not\nreally abandoned. You're not really on your own.\"\nThat's true. There are cameras\nshooting you right now. But what you all\nare going to experience because you're here is that when you're tired\nand you're hungry or you feel left out,\nit's gonna feel very real because you're gonna\nhave those same cravings for community. And what truly\nsets Survivor apart from any other social experiment\nlike this is the game\nthat sits on top of it, a game that's\nplayed with humans. The same humans you are\nforming your community with are your adversaries. So you have to build a community with people you can rely on\nwhile you vote them out and then\nafter you vote them out, you go back to them\nand try to persuade them to give you the vote\nfor the million dollars. How do you pull off\nthat magic trick? So let's see if we can solidify\nyour community a little bit by giving you an identity\nwith a tribe name. We'll start with Blue.\nBlue, you are Tuku. -Tuku!\n(cheering, whooping) In the middle, Red, Lavo. -Lavo!\n-(cheering)\n-Yes. And on the end, Gata. -Gata!\n-Gata.\n-(cheering) PROBST:\nAll right,\nso let's see if we can get a little personality\nfrom our tribes. Guy in the front, in the middle,\nwhat's your name? My name is Gabe,\nfrom Baltimore City. What do you bring\nto your community back home? I mean, when it comes to\nworking, I'm a grinder, man. I try to lead by example,\nand I try to be the guy that says, \"I'm just\nas tired as you are, but \"if I got energy to keep going,\nI know for sure that you got energy\nto keep going.\" In the front, in the middle,\nintroduce yourself. Uh, my name is Teeny.\nI know it looks like I'm from the Wild Wild West\nright now, but I'm actually\na proud New Jerseyan. I feel like this is, like,\naggressively scarecrow, and, uh, that's not really\nNew Jersey's vibe, but, you know, I like to change it up\nwith, like, my style. Just to be clear, it's not like I gave you these pants. -These are your...\n-No, I... I... It's my style. It's my style.\nI own it. I'm just saying:\nNew Jersey proud. (laughing) PROBST:\nGuy in the corner. -What's your name?\n-Hi. I'm Andy. Andy, talk to us\nabout your role back home. What's your life about? Growing up,\nI had, like, four friends. So unpopular because\nI did not have an identity, and I kept trying\ndifferent things. I would wear\nGrateful Dead T-shirts to be... pretend I was a stoner. I'm afraid of weed. -I can't smoke weed.\nI can't do that.\n-(laughing) I was a poser, right?\nBut I learned that I just have to be myself, and it's become a super magnet for everyone in my life\nthat I have today. -PROBST: Guy on the end.\n-Yeah. -Introduce yourself.\n-I'm Jon. I'm a podcast host, and I really care\nwhat people think of me. (laughing) So much.\nFour friends in high school? Must be nice. (laughing) PROBST:\nWell, Jon, it's always so exciting to start\na new season of Survivor. So, what's the energy right now? You know,\nI'm here in part because every episode you say,\n\"Apply to be on Survivor.\" And you have this idea of what you would play like or what you could play like. And I think\nwe're all nervous because what we would play like\nor could play like is about to be fact-checked\nagainst what we will play like. -PROBST: Wow.\n-And if you're cocky,\nthat's exciting. (laughing) And if you're not, it's not. (laughing) Well, shall we get\nto the next phase? -(all voicing assent)\n-PROBST: All right. Your first test as new tribes is waiting for you\nin the jungle. -AYSHA: Oh, my God.\n-Follow me. AYSHA:\nOh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. ANDY: Jeff walks us down the beach, turns a corner\n and takes us to... It could only be described as, like, a gladiator's arena. Look, I've seen a lot\n of Survivor. There are opening challenges, but this one\n really takes the cake in terms of the grandness. And the pressure is on.\n Like, you have to perform or you're gonna\nbe in trouble immediately. All right. Let's get to your\nfirst challenge as new tribes. Here's how it works. Two players from each tribe are gonna crawl\n under a muddy net. You're gonna race\n into the jungle... ...and retrieve\n two puzzle pieces from one of three\n different obstacles. Then you race back,\n the next pair goes. Once you have all six pieces, two tribe members\n will use those pieces to solve a rectangular puzzle. The first tribe to finish earns their camp supplies. You know the drill. It's not much--\na pot, a machete and a flint-- but out here, it's everything, and will provide\na massive head start. The two losing tribes will have\nto try to earn it another way. -Make sense? All right,\n-Yup. give everybody a minute\nto strategize, we'll get started. -All right.\n-SUE: Let's go. Here we go. First challenge of Survivor 47. Survivors ready? (cheering) -Go! You're going out in pairs.\n-(cheering) Get through that mud. Come on, guys! SIERRA:\nCome on, Gata! That mud is birthing you\ninto Survivor right there. SUE:\nLet's go! Yeah! (whoops)\nGo, Caroline, go! PROBST:\nThere goes Kyle\nin the lead for Tuku. Camp supplies on the line. Biggest head start\nyou can get in this game is the pot, the machete\nand the flint. (cheering) -Let's go!\n-(whooping) All right, here we go.\nLet's go. -I'm on left.\n-Okay, go. PROBST:\nWorking together\nto free up these puzzle pieces. Got to get\nall that rope through. -They're all spooled up.\n-All right. Watch that one. -O-Over.\n-Watch out. PROBST:\nOnce your pieces\nare free, you can head back. These pieces are heavy. Sam heading back\nwith the first piece for Gata. SIERRA:\nCome on, Gata! -(whooping)\n-Let's go, Sam! -(overlapping shouting)\n-I see you! Come on! Aysha has her piece.\nKishan has his. SAM:\nCome on. PROBST: Sam's back to help. -Okay. Ready?\n-Yeah. Yeah.\n-PROBST: Kyle and Caroline still -working for Tuku.\n-KYLE: Okay. How do you feel about it? KYLE: Keep going. SOL:\nThere we go. There we go. That's how you do it\non Survivor, right there! -(cheering)\n-Let's go! Got to get back with both\npieces. Keep going, Aysha. You're good, Lavo. Head out.\nIt's Teeny and Genevieve. SUE:\nGuys, get ready. -Go!\n-You're good, Gata! Head out! Rachel and Jon. Go, Jon! Go, Rachel! PROBST:\nYou're good, Tuku. Head out. It's Gabe and Sue. CAROLINE:\nYes! Make it up. PROBST: Jon whipping that rope. Wow!\n-This way, this way. -Okay.\n-PROBST: Teeny and Genevieve\ndoing a nice job working together. Threading that rope through. Sue has hers, Gabe has his. -Tuku, you can head back.\n-TEENY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! PROBST: Sue! Lok at that. PROBST:\nGabe heading back with a piece. Sue heading back with a piece. -Go, go, go.\n-PROBST: You're good, Gata. Go! TK:\nThere we go, let's go! Let's go, Tuku! Get 'em back to the tower. You're good, Tuku. Head out. -Tiyana and TK. Whoa.\n-Whoa! TK whipping through the mud. (overlapping shouting) You're good, Gata. Go! Sierra and Andy. PROBST:\nLavo, you got to keep moving. You're good. Head out. Sol and Rome. The last two. TK heads back to his team. (overlapping shouting) PROBST:\nSol heading back with\na puzzle piece for Lavo. Lavo's closing the gap\nright now. Rome is free.\nIt's now Gata in dead last. Andy and Sierra-- they have\nblown the little lead they had. Tuku with their final\npuzzle piece. You're good, Tuku.\nStart solving the puzzle. It's probably the, um...\nLet's try it. PROBST:\nIt is Caroline and Kyle\nfor Tuku. That's gonna be an end piece? Solving a rectangular puzzle. Have to just put in... -All right, let's go.\n-Lavo, you're good. -Start working on the puzzle.\n-Oh. -Go, Gata!\n-Come on, Gata! PROBST:\nHere comes Andy.\nHe's got one piece. Gata still has one piece left. -Can you catch it?\n-PROBST: Gata's dead\nlast right now. (grunting) Now you're good, Gata.\nStart working. Rachel and Anika trying to make up\na lot of time for Gata, who are working together to solve a complicated Survivor puzzle, with tribe supplies on the line. We scoot it once.\nThat could go... here. PROBST:\nThere is no second place today, just two losers. -Yeah.\n-Yes, and then that one there.\n-PROBST: Gata now has new momentum. Anika and Rachel\nfeeling excited now that maybe\nthey have something sorted. -Yes, guys!\n-Yep. -Yes!\n-This one right here. -This one right here.\n-Gata with a lot\nof enthusiasm right now. Guys, guys, don't worry,\ndon't worry, don't worry. -Let's go!\n-PROBST: Is this it? Have they solved it? -Yes, go!\n-They got here last. Can they finish first? -Push it in there! Yeah!\n-Put that in there! PROBST:\nPut the top on. -Oh, my God.\n-You got to get up. Why you never give up\nin this game, ever. -Let's go! Let's go!\n-Let's go! PROBST:\nThey got to get the top on. And they've got it!\nGet to the top! -(whooping)\n-PROBST: It's over! Gata wins tribe supplies. -That's it.\n-(whooping) PROBST:\nA lot of effort from Gata\nto stay in this. -That was hard. That's no joke.\n-No, that was tough. -GENEVIEVE: Good try.\n-PROBST: Wow. None of us could get it. One, two, three. GATA:\nGata! All right.\nGata, congratulations. -(whooping)\n-Tribe supplies are yours.\nIt's not much. A pot, a machete and a flint. But out here, it is everything. Come grab it.\nAlong with a map to your home. Gata, grab your stuff, head out.\nYou get the big advantage of starting work on your camp. SAM:\nThank you, Jeff. -Good job, guys. Good job.\n-Thank you. -Killer. You were a killer.\n-Oh, thank you. PROBST:\nAll right, Tuku, Lavo, no tribe supplies for you. You're gonna have\nto try to earn them another way. Here's how it's gonna work. Each tribe's gonna choose\none person to take on this task. You're not gonna get any information\nabout what is required, so you're making a blind choice. How about rock, scissors,\nodd man out goes? -Do you want to go?\n-No. All right, who's it gonna be? All right,\nAysha's going for Lava. Tuku, how about you?\nMake a decision? There's three people\nthat want to go, so that's why\nwe're gonna either throw a rock or scissors,\nand then the odd man out goes. I love this! -Yeah.\n-Ready? Rock, paper, scissors. -Geez.\n-Not you throwing paper,\nand we said rock first. Is that what you said? (laughing) TIYANA:\nBut, yeah, you're odd man out. Decision has been made. We have Aysha for Lavo,\nTK for Tuku. You two are heading\nout together. Head down.\nBoat'll pick you up. Good luck. All right, Tuku,\nmap to your new home. -Thank you.\n-Lavo, map to your home.\n-Hey, yeah, baby. -Yeah!\n-Grab your stuff, head out. -Good luck.\n-Thank you. -Thanks, Jeff.\n-Thank you, Jeff. ROME: Aysha chose\n to go on this journey, which-- props to you,\nbut big mistake. The social game\n is the biggest aspect of the game of Survivor, and I am not gonna miss out on those first few hours\nof strategizing. It's so important.\n That's exactly how I'm gonna win the million\n dollars at the end of the day.

(whooping) -Victory.\n-Okay, you guys,\nwe got to give it a second. Group hug. We did that.\nWe really did that. RACHEL:\n This is the best moment\n of my life. I love competition\nand I love to win. SAM:\nYeah, let's go in the water. RACHEL:\nYeah, let's do that.\nLet's do that. Okay, let's go, let's go! RACHEL:\n We solved that puzzle, 100%, because of good communication. Like, it was a community effort, like, full stop. SIERRA:\nGuys, I'm just so proud to be a part of a winning team. (laughing) JON: It felt like baptism\n by mud. Like, we're gonna win this challenge and\nevery challenge that follows. JON:\nWe don't really know each other,\n but this is a tribe that can win challenges\nbecause we did. I live in Los Angeles. No, I started in WeHo,\nwhere all the gays go. I was a speechwriter\nfor a while. -Okay.\n-Whoa! And then I started a podcast -called Pod Save America. -Wow. JON:\n I was a speech writer\n for Hillary Clinton back when she was a senator\n and then I became a speechwriter in the\nWhite House for President Obama. And now, when people\nask me what I do, I have to say that\nI'm a ... podcast host. -Am I good?\n-You're good. You're good. JON:\n When I was a closeted teen, I watched Richard Hatch\n win the first season. I ran around the house screaming about\nwhat I had just witnessed. -JON: What should we do?\n-ANIKA: Most important thing: -shelter?\n-Yeah.\n-Yeah. JON:\n And now, all these\n years later, I'm here. I feel a little bit like\nthe dog that caught the car. -So, something with a...\n-A piece of bamboo across, like, that? -And then one over there.\n-Yeah, something\nwith, like, a crotch. I am a numbers guy\n and that's how I want to play this game. Because I look at Survivor as ultimately, a numbers game. -Good? All right.\n-Yup. ANDY:\n There are only six\n people on the tribe, but that constitutes\n 15 one-on-one relationships. You could do the math.\n It's a pretty simple equation. It's a combination. Six, choose two, factorial equals 15. So if I connect with two people, it would actually be very hard\n to get voted out. ANDY: Because if I could\n count on two people to not write my name down, it would be very difficult\nfor four people to write my name down. Who has to come out\nto their own girlfriend? And I'm like, \"Okay.\"\nAnd they're great vibes. But I'm just saying,\nI just think, you know, we just have that... -We don't need to try.\n-I love it. -I love it.\n-You know what I mean?\n-Unspoken. -Guys, like, unspoken.\n-All right. (laughing) (laughing) SUE: I like your idea\nof getting a shelter started. Let's do it. -The more we have,\nthe more comfortable we'll be.\n-Yeah. TIYANA:\nNot winning that challenge today actually sunk me to my core. Fingers crossed\n that TK comes through and brings back something good\nfor this tribe, because we're gonna\nneed it tonight. What type of vibe\nare we going for here? Looking around at my tribe,\n I feel like we stack up incredibly well\nin terms of physical strength. SUE:\nYou guys rock. This is crazy. (laughs) TIYANA:\n But puzzle-wise, we have some work to do. Tie? Uh, I mean,\nat least for right now. If we find more,\nwe can always reinforce it. Coming into this game, I want\n to work with an older person. I want to work with somebody who's a little more mature\n because I got a bit of an old soul\nin me, right? SUE: Uh-huh. What?! In my opinion, an older person-- they know how to operate\n without getting caught up in the social games of it all. That's somebody\nwho I want my day one, number one\nalliance member to be. People are gonna be running\naround with their heads cut off. People are gonna\nbe whispering at Tribal. When that happens... Thank you. Ditto. GABE:\n Let these kids gossip\nand clique up among themselves. We'll run things in the shadows. Yeah. -Grandson. Aiden.\n-Grandson. -Yeah.\n-Aiden. How old is he? He's four. I love Caroline.\n She is literally the sweetest person\nin the world. Survivor is really\nmy mom's and I thing. Now, see, it's me and Chelsea's.\nSame thing, so you get it. She's so excited,\n and that's like my daughter, so, it's cool.\nLike, there's something there. Yeah. Uh, what do you mean? You're the main person\nthat I feel, like, -I've got, like...\n-Oh, good. -Oh, no, no, no. Exact opposite.\n-Okay. At my age, I thought for sure I would be the very bottom. But now I feel\n like Caroline and Gabe-- they're-they're my number ones, and so I'm feeling good with it.\n Now we're gonna be a force\nto be reckoned with. KISHAN:\n All right. We're just\n organizing them from, like, -Biggest to smallest.\n-biggest to smallest so that it's, like, a nice incline. -I think this one over here...\n-This one's got some girth. Yeah.\nSo, let's move this one. -Yep. -KISHAN: Losing that\n first challenge-- it sucks.\n We're not the tallest tribe. We didn't look to be\n the strongest, but Lava-- we're-we're resourceful. We just have to trust\nour instincts and kind of fall back onto our training\nand our, like, gut. So, that's what we're doing. Yeah! Like... KISHAN:\n I'm an emergency room doctor. I love the chaos. TEENY:\nI think it's a dead hermit crab. We could eat it. Oh... Doctor. KISHAN:\n You're just\n constantly surrounded by the unknown, and I'm so ready for that,\n'cause that's what I do every single day for a living,\nand I'm really good at it, and I'm gonna be good at it\non Survivor, too. TEENY:\nCan you guys tell me,\non a scale of one to ten, how dweeby\nmy first buff look was? It was some variation of this for all of the opening events\nof the day. Where are you gonna place it?\nGive it to me straight. -SOL: You want it straight?\n-TEENY: Yeah. SOL:\nIt's at, like,\na four and a half. -(all laughing)\n-(indistinct chatter) TEENY:\n Playing Survivor is about the social relationships\nyou make. In school, the one thing\n that I really excelled at was being able to make friends\n and talk to people. And so I'm gonna\n play this game by being every single person's\n number one. (laughing): Exac... Keyshawn and I bonded\n almost immediately. So, I mean, he's an ER doctor. He has an ability\n to work under pressure. And I feel like he's a bit more\nintroverted to my extrovert, so I felt like he was\na cool yin to my yang. I think she's\ngot the perfect vibe. -Yes.\n-I think it's gonna be great. Us three stick together,\nwe're good to go. GENEVIEVE:\n The new era of Survivor is a very fast-paced game, and right now,\n I just really like Rome. -ROME: Oh, oh, I got it.\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God, water! -(whooping)\n-(clapping)\n-SOL: Wow. GENEVIEVE:\nI like him. I get along with him so well. He's so enthusiastic. I just feel happy\nwhen I talk to him. Oh, that's so good.\nOh, my gosh. GENEVIEVE:\n I'm also trying to solidify\n something with Teeny. I would love\nto have her as my ally. (gasps) Me too. Me too. I really like Genevieve. I want to play this game\n with her. But let's remember we have\nan entire tribe member coming back here. (whoops)\nMy goodness. -So, TK.\n-How you feeling? -Aysha.\n-Nice to introduce me, -nice to meet... For sure.\n-Yes. -This is wild.\n-We have... Oh, my gosh. -Okay.\n-You want to break it down? When I read that\n one person was going to get their camp supplies\n and the other was gonna go back to camp empty-handed,\nmy stomach dropped. This man looks like he currently is in the NFL. -So, on three?\n-All right. Yes. -One, two, three.\n-One, two, three. Whoa. Here we go. Okay. What am I looking for? So, when I uncovered the clue and saw that it was a picture,\n I realized this is my guide. I have to match the two to find the key.\n It's gonna look identical. Okay. Agua. I look at this map.\n I see the first X, and it's this huge rock face\n that is near. So I'm thinking,\n\"Just look for a big rock face. I'll find the X.\" I look around-- there's, like,\neight rock faces. So, everything looks\nexactly the same. This is this rock. It's saying \"between two rocks.\" Ah, there it is.\nThat's what I'm looking for. That's it. (quietly): Yes! So, when I got my first key,\n that gives me the clue to be able\n to find that second key. A mountain of rocks. Okay.\nThis a mountain of rocks? Oh. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,\nyes, yes, yes, yes. Let's... I get that first key\n and I'm hyped. Now I got my confidence.\nNow I know I can do it. Come on, T, come on, T. (grunts) Oh! Oh, my goodness.\nYes! This is it. Perfect. I found my second key\n and I feel like I'm cooking, we're going, I have it. Okay. (sighs): Okay.\nCome on, bro. It has to be over here. Let's see if it's right here. Here it is. I never would have thought that the final key was in the ocean. This is it.\n Whoever finds the fourth key wins. See, thi-this is the tree. Yes!\nYes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, that's two keys.\n I'm hyping myself up like, \"They don't\n know who they messing with.\" All right.\nThree trees by theirselves. Come on, T. I don't even know\nhow to get back down. I don't even remember\nwhere the path was. How am I--\nI'm lost. I'm lost. Let's go. Let's go.\nNow I'm getting my rhythm. Give me my money. Uh-oh.\nHold up. In the ... ocean is insane. Well, got to go back down, then. (grunts) Oh, my God, dude,\nwhere is the exit? The forest is so dense. And I'm like, \"You know what, \"forget that path.\nMake your own path, like you've done\nyour entire life.\" I am about\nto muscle through this. Oh! (whoops) I don't care what I hit.\n I'm making my own path through this brush\n and I'm figuring it out. Where is this thing? This is the path?\nNo, this is just where I was. I can't believe being lost is what's setting me back. It's to where\nI can't get out of here because I'm lost? Where?\nCome on, come on. Oh, I can't see\nall the damn mud, dude. There we go. You got it? Oh... (sighs)\nHey, no, no, no, no. -Let's go.\n-Oh, you got it? Let's go, bro! AYSHA:\n The fact that I was\n so close-- oh, it hurt. It hurt so much. TK:\n At the end of the day,\n there is honestly no better feeling in the world\nthan seeing this pot and machete and flint. (whoops) And it's because of me. So, I'm gonna\ntake the credit on that. Nice little pat on the back. (laughs) Ooh! AYSHA:\n I was heartbroken.

(\u266a\u266a) -\u266a \u266a\n-(birdsong) -(chopping)\n -ANIKA: You guys ever have -a sprouted coconut?\n-RACHEL: No. Sprouted coconut. So, basically,\nit's, like, when a coconut falls to the ground\nand starts growing a new plant. If you catch it at specifically\nthe right time and you crack it open,\nit has, like, this fluffy, -foamy, like,\ngood-textured coconut.\n-RACHEL: Oh! -So, that might be a good thing.\n-And there's one-- No, it's a great thing.\nAnd it's over there and it's growing, and we\ncan all, like, have dessert. JON: Anika is just prepared. She's a prepared person. She watched\n a YouTube on coconuts and she spotted\n a sprouted coconut, which is a trendy food in Los Angeles and also available in Fiji. The first base-- we'll want it\noff the floor, right? So, we have to dig four holes. Even though I told myself before coming out here,\n\"Do not take the lead,\" I'm a project manager\n true at heart. My head cannot help but say, \"Hey, guys, these are the steps \"that need to happen\n in order to get \"from A to Z. Let's do that.\" We're gonna need\nway more bamboo. -RACHEL: Okay.\n-SIERRA: All right. Take a loop. SAM: I love Anika\n taking the leadership role, mainly because I don't want it.\n I want to be the glue guy. Every sports team\nknows what a glue guy is. They're not\nthe best on the team. They're not\nthe worst on the team. They find their way\nsomewhere in the middle, but somehow the team\njust doesn't function the same without them. RACHEL:\nWait, we can dig\nbefore we make it, right? Yeah, we can dig, we can dig. -(laughs): Oh!\n-Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Boom! -Was it right\nin between your legs?\n-No babies for you! SAM:\n It's the guy in\n a friend group that it's like, once he's there, you feel like, \"Hey, the whole group's here.\" Crisis averted. But I think if you keep\nthe glue guy around for too long in this game, you end\nup getting burned by him. You know what\nI would love a lot? Fire. ALL:\nThat's what we're doing. SAM:\nL... I love that you guys are proactive enough\nto think of it on your own. -SIERRA: Can I give the fire\na go for a second?\n-Yeah. SIERRA: I'm always\n looked at as like, \"Oh, \"just the pretty blonde\nwith, like, a cute little smile.\" I was a pageant queen. I competed at Miss USA.\n But my dad always wanted a boy, and I just ended up\n being my dad's little boy. This is for you, Dad.\nLet's see if I can do it. I'm gonna try to make fire.\n And this is why winning the first challenge\n was so important. Hot flint and a machete--\n that's everything. We wouldn't be able to build our community\n without that stuff. ANIKA:\nYep, keep going. -(whooping)\n-Fire! SAM:\nPageant queen does fire. -Pageant queen did it! -SIERRA: We're off\n to a hot start. We are killing it out here. There's no better feeling. TK: I can't wait to just see my tribemates' faces when I walk onto that camp and I have\nthe tribe supplies. (grunts) Yo, yo, where the squad at? My tribe is gonna be happy,\n and I just can't wait to see how much equity\nthat builds me in my tribe. -Whoa!\n-Whoa.\n-Oh! GABE:\nNo way! (all shrieking, cheering) (indistinct chatter) TK:\n Everybody's running up to me.\n They're doing, like, jumping and--\nlike we're in we're in the NBA or we just scored a bucket\nand we all jumping up and doing\nour shoulder bumps. -Really?\n-Only of us could get it. -And you-- Oh, bro! Oh, my God.\n-(whooping) SUE:\nWow! TK! Come on.\nWow. TK:\n There's no way, now, that you could look at me and say, \"this guy needs to go first\" or \"this guy needs to go\"\nat all. Aysha comes over and then she starts trying to, like,\nwrestle me for the key. And I'm like,\n\"Whoa, wait a minute.\" Hey, all good, man, all good.\nLook, as long as we are comfortable.\n(laughs) CAROLINE:\n Oh, my gosh, when TK arrived at camp, the guys flocked to him. Where you from? PG county. -Really?\n-TK: Yeah, man. I already know. I was\ngonna-I was gonna tell you. -I went to Towson, bro.\n-Really? -Yeah.\n-GABE: Hell yeah, dude. -Hell yeah.\n-TK: That was good times\nover there. CAROLINE: The guys fell in love with each other the moment\nthat they saw each other. KYLE:\nI live in, like, a small town. Like, \"four stoplights for\nthe whole place\" kind of thing. -GABE: Get the hell\nout of here. Really?\n-Yeah. We got a lot\nof, like, inland lakes and waterways\nthat connect to and from. CAROLINE:\n I'm not an idiot. I can tell. It's a bromance. GABE: Yeah. TK:\nHold on. I'm-I'm gonna\npull it with you, though. Hold on one second. Oh, hold on, here we go. I'm just pulling it this way.\nThere we go. GABE:\n Oh, my God. At the base\n of this really big log, I see a Beware Advantage staring\nback at me, and then I kind of lean on top of it and I just put my hand over it.\n You know, instantly, I start calculating\n in my brain, \"How can I get TK\n away from this? I'm not totally sure I want to bring him\nthat deep in quite yet. Luckily, TK leaves\n and I just get a chance alone. Once I make the decision to take it, that is set in stone. This is something\n that I want to move on fast. And a note says... \"You will dig up a box\nthat contains \"everything you need\nto claim an immunity idol. \"Until you take possession\nof the idol, \"you cannot participate\nin the vote at Tribal Council. That's why it says 'Beware.'\" I realized that\n the branch where I found the Beware Advantage was right on the path. And then, lo and behold, found this box\n with a lock on it and a tube, which has more instructions\n on what to do. It says... \"Unbraid the vines to release\nthe key that unlocks the box.\" And of course I know\n what the rock face is. It's a massive,\n massive rock base right next to our tribe's camp. So, I know I have to bring\n what's up there down to me with these vines. I can see the key wrapped around the ring on the top\n of this rock base. My precious!\nThere it is. GABE:\nDo you want to find out? I'm such an idiot. -You want to help me?\n-Yeah. GABE:\n Right away, I was like,\n let me not play coy. Let me just bring him into this right away and say, \"Let's\nfind out what this is together.\" That's a key, dude.\nDude. That's probably for the... We found a key before we found anything else. That doesn't sound right.\n Like, that's not adding up.\n So, in my mind, I'm like, \"I caught you in the act\nbut you weren't gonna \"tell me about this,\nso maybe we aren't as close as we thought we were.\" GABE: I kind of feed TK this story\nof \"I just found it\" and I think I he bought it. Yeah. I finally have this key\n in my possession, and I-I really\n need to find time to return to the box, but not be\n too hasty about it, because it just leads to mistakes. AYSHA: Riding back to camp with no camp supplies, I was so fearful. I'm just thinking, \"I haven't just disappointed\nmyself in this moment, but I've disappointed my tribe.\" Hello. Oh, Aysha! -Aysha!\n-KISHAN: Yeah! -Okay, story time, story time.\n-Oh, my God. AYSHA:\n I knew that the only way to approach talking to my tribe\nwas being honest. I literally had nothing to hide. Um, we arrived to the beach, and there's this stand and the instructions say\nthere are two paths and only one tribe was gonna get the camp supplies. TEENY:\n Being a Survivor fan, I've listened\n to Aysha's podcast before. It seems like she's very bright. She picks up on a lot of things\nthat even I miss from the show, and that could\n be helpful for my game. -Well, thank you for going.\n-GENEVIEVE: Thank you\nfor trying and going. I was like,\n\"Oh, it was for nothing.\" TEENY:\n So, the first thing I did\n was pull her aside and say, \"Listen,\nI think I know who you are. -Okay.\n-And I... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right, right, right. So, I don't plan on... -I would never tell anybody.\n-Okay. -I just wanted to tell you.\n-Thanks. So, when Teeny approached me about recognizing me\nand knowing me from Rob Has a Podcast, that made me so nervous. But I really do feel, like,\na genuine connection with Teeny. I'm just trying to make sure\nthat I'm not blindsided by... good vibes. SOL:\nYeah, Lavo. -TEENY: Yes.\n-(Genevieve laughs) AYSHA: Everyone playing\n the game of Survivor is here to win\n a million dollars, and so I'm trusting everyone until they give me a reason\n to lose trust. Who knows\nwhat's about to happen? AYSHA: Yeah. -Oh, for real?\n-Mm-hmm. Ah.\nSeems like my whole tribe likes me, which is good. I said that\n when I start this game, the main thing that I want to do is immediately start looking\n for advantages and try to do it\n in the smartest way. It is hard,\nin this new era of Survivor, to look for these advantages\nand not get caught. I need to go this way. I don't know. I just-- I... I feel like we just-- Yeah. ROME:\n On day one,\n looking for an idol-- that could put a huge target\n on your back. But at the end of the day, I want to play this game\n as hard as possible. So I have to make sure\n that if I'm looking, I am looking everywhere, and if I look everywhere, I feel like I'm-a find it. (gasps) I didn't even\n see the word \"beware.\" I just see the word \"advantage.\" That's all it is.\n Because guess what? That advantage is gonna be in my\nhands instead of someone else. It said right there at the path, you'll be able to find a box with everything you need\nto get your idol. Oh, my gosh. Once I started\n to dig on the path in the broad daylight, that was when I realized,\n\"This is not a good idea.\" Thing is, it's right there\n where everyone's walking. It's directly\n on the way to the well. And so I almost\n have to do this at night. I just feel\n absolutely incredible at how I'm playing the game\nto start things off.

For the Toughest\nJobs on Planet Earth. This is a Survivor moment\nright here. -I know.\nIt's a huge Survivor moment.\n-Right here. -Is it dead, though?\n-No, it's-it was moving. GABE: This is a group that I imagine most Survivor tribes are like in the early days,\n where everyone's just really, really excited,\nunderstandably so. -Let's run into it.\n-(Caroline whooping) -TK: Yes! Let's go!\n-CAROLINE: Let's go, Tiyana! (whoops) GABE:\n But I've had a lot of time to be excited.\n Now's not the time to be excited, now's the time\nto take care of business. It's why we're here.\nIt's what I plan to do. I found a key earlier today to unlock this box\n buried in the ground, but TK walked up and caught me. And now I'm realizing\n I need somebody to keep an eye out for me. And Sue was somebody\n that I could work with to actually accomplish the tasks that were at hand. When he told me he found\n the Beware Advantage, that was huge. Like, I never expected\nanybody to ever tell me that they found an-an advantage. -All right.\n-Okay. He'll be coming\nfrom what direction? Okay. So, I'm definitely\n gonna be the lookout for when Gabe goes off hunting\nfor this advantage. \u266a \u266a The fire's doing good. GABE:\n I hear from Sue, and I have no more time. I grab that lock that's\n hooked on the box and I just rip it out of the ground\n as hard as I possibly can and I just take off sprinting. Let me just get off this path\nas soon as I can. Wow. Oh, my God.\n When I open it, I find a second box\n within the first box. And I'm not happy about it. I broke my neck\n to get this thing, and now it comes with this big caveat. It's only good\n for one Tribal Council. If you want to keep going,\n there's another task, and that will give you\nan idol that's good for three Tribal Councils. I fancy myself a gambler\n in real life. I like betting on sports,\nI like going to the casino. Scared money don't make money. So I put the one-time-use idol\n inside the smaller box and I took the clue,\n and it says, \"Follow the map\nto the driftwood. \"Break open the driftwood\nto find the key that unlocks the box.\" So, I realize I have\n to hide this box somewhere and figure out what the next step\nof the equation is. That did not sound that great. (sighs) I don't even know\nwhat's happening up there. I couldn't even possibly guess\nwhat he was doing up in the rock mountains? GABE:\n I am just panicking\n and-and panicking. My heart rate is pounding. I had a rough start\n to this game. I sit here with no vote,\n no idol, a whole task to do. It's gonna be a very mentally stressful\nnext couple days. \u266a \u266a Where am I needed? -Vining?\n-RACHEL: There's a ton\non the floor there. And there's, like,\nthat one back there. SAM: I love Vine. RACHEL: Mm. Oh, my God! I was just wondering\n'cause you... Vine was awesome. That's right.\nI was still a young person. JON: Looking at my tribe,\n I'm realizing I'm not getting to know\na group of people. I'm getting to know\na group of young people. I am 41 years old. Okay, so I'm old now? No, I really like Vine.\nI like... There's so much\n \"back in my day\" stuff coming out of my mouth. But, being a speechwriter,\n I learned that you need to be able\n to put yourself in other people's shoes. I'm addicted to TikTok. -It's so good.\n-I am, too. SAM:\nAll the boomers are like,\n\"We got to ban TikTok.\" And I'm just like,\n\"I need my videos of, like, dogs getting adopted.\" JON:\n I'm realizing that\n I'm the oldest person here, but I'm not gonna\n let that stop me from trying to build things with these people. We're doing great. -We're doing amazing.\n-Yeah. Also, I learned this thing I read. My stepdad\nwas like, \"You're gonna die out there.\" He gave me,\nlike, this survivor book for Christmas,\nand if you hold your fingers up to the bottom of the sun, -every finger's 15 minutes.\n-SAM: I read that. -I read that.\n-Oh. -Oh.\n-JON: You read that?\n-SAM: Yeah. A book or a website? A book.\nMine was a book. -SAM: It was on the Internet.\n-It was hard copy. ANDY:\n I first saw Rachel, and I just knew she was someone that\nI wanted to hitch my wagon to. I feel like\nwe've got, like, two hours. Okay. All right. ANDY:\n Right now, I feel like\n I trust Jon and I'm working with Jon,\n but that's it. And that makes me uncomfortable,\n as a numbers guy. Yeah. Let's go. So I really put it upon myself\nto find an opportunity to get a moment with Rachel. That's awesome.\nI feel good about you, too. We're... in alignment.\nWe're synchronized. I agree. I'm like,\n\"You're strong. I'm strong.\" -Yeah. Yeah.\n-I feel like it's good. Part of the appeal\n of Survivor to me is that I love games, and Andy is just the sweetest, but I don't think\n he's strategic. -...in a minute. -RACHEL: He just, like, is a little too eager, maybe, to, like, just to bond and to get to know each other. You have to be careful, though. -Maybe not tomorrow.\n-Yeah, yeah. -I'll follow your lead.\n-Okay. RACHEL:\n It's super suspicious to get up early\nand meet on the beach to talk. Like, absolutely not.\nI am not doing that, Andy. ANDY:\n I couldn't sleep. I wasn't sleeping at all. I was just in these sort of\n negative thoughts, feeling like, in this\n new community, I'm somewhere where I don't belong. And I just needed\n to talk with someone, someone I felt good about\n because I feel like... I am spiraling, in a way. -It's just that I...\n-No, like, you don't\neven need to say. Like, someone definitely knows\nwe're here, -and so, like, that, actually...\n-Yeah, you're so right. RACHEL:\n One of the things\n a Survivor player shouldn't do is go off to talk.\n This is really obvious. People just heard us\n in the shelter. All right,\ndo you want to sit or what? RACHEL:\n And I just literally told him, \"That's a bad idea.\nWe shouldn't do that.\" And then he does it anyway. It doesn't make me more confident that he's going\nto be a good alliance member. ANDY:\nI just can't sleep. -I just need to talk.\n-No, no, you're fine. -No, tell me.\n-I thought I would come in here and be a little different\nthan I am. RACHEL:\nWhat did you think\nyou were gonna be? I thought I was gonna\nbe the version of myself that, like, I feel like I am today, but -feel like I'm going\na little bit backwards.\n-Yeah. He's feeling insecure, and I totally empathized\n with him, but you can't take those moments\n of downness and then just kind of rip\nsomebody else's ga... game and pull them down with you. -We need to get the fire going?\n-ANDY: Yeah. RACHEL:\nMake coconuts first, then fire, -'cause we need to eat.\n-Right. ANDY:\n Rachel's someone\nI felt so good about on day one. -Thank you for doing this.\n-Of course. ANDY:\n But I tried opening up\n to Rachel. I thought that would give me a sense of relief, but I don't feel like\n I got that closure at all. And that put me\n in a very difficult and negative headspace. ANDY:\nRight now. I feel like I've felt very often in my past. RACHEL:\nYeah! ANDY:\n Sort of a high school feeling, like I'm different,\n I stick out in a bad way with a group of people all enjoying\n each other's company... RACHEL:\nYou're so accurate.\nThat's really hard to do. -ALL: Oh!\n-That's a good-ass coconut. ANDY:\n ...without me. -SIERRA: Yes! Give me some.\n-That was beautiful. ANDY:\n When I'm cracking my coconut, people aren't even watching me. Jon-- he cracks a coconut and there are cheers\n from everyone else at camp. And I had this gut feeling I am on the bottom. This could be my last day\nplaying Survivor. -JON: It could be any of us.\n-I'm going crazy. I'm the least popular\non this tribe, and it's okay. It's okay. JON:\n I feel like I'm in a really\n good place with Andy, but there's some anxiety\nunder there, beneath the surface, and that makes me nervous. I don't know if I want\nto work with somebody like that. Th e tr ut h ab ou t DI Y is you never really do it\n all by yourself. Because this setup took\n2 videos, and a quick demo.

You're in good hands\n with Allstate. \u266a \u266a GABE: The next clue told me I have to go find a piece\n of driftwood out on the beach that has a key inside of it that\nwill open up the second box that will then give me\n the three Tribal idol. And the clock is ticking. So the X on the map\n says it's into the brush, and lo and behold, there's\n a piece of driftwood there. I know that there's\n a key inside of it, so, I just smash it\n like I'm Donkey Kong. (groans softly) Every slam of this driftwood-- it's deeper than\n just getting this key. This is giving my vote back. Who knows how much time I have\n before people get up, and I don't know if I'm gonna\n have another opportunity to keep looking for this thing. Come on. Oh. Come on! (sighs) Bingo. So, now that I finally have this key in my possession, I'm exhausted, but I can't wait to get back to the box. (sighs) There's a catch.\n There's a third box within the second box. It never seems to end. Leave it to Survivor to just not let me\ntake a breath. This was a tough call\n I was making, but this has been so damn hard. I'm really excited\n because I have power again. I have my vote back. I'm a dragon sitting on top\nof a pile of gold. -Personally love him.\n-Yeah, personally love him. -Yeah, I hear you.\n-Yeah, truly. SOL:\n I-I really think\n he has something. Last night, I dug up a box. There was a gigantic lock\n on the box, and then I found the scroll, and I knew there was no way\n I was gonna be able to read the scroll\n in the pitch black. And so, today,\n I walked away by myself so I can read this advantage\nand do the next step. \"Soak... soak the drift...\" That's so random.\nOkay. All right.\nI can do this, though. Once I got that second clue, I realized, \"Okay,\n this is absolutely insane.\" But, man, if I can find this\nand get this done fast, that'll be awesome. All of a sudden,\n I heard a twig snap. I look up,\nand Aysha's right there. Hey. Huh? ROME:\n Granted, I don't think\n she saw me pouring water on the driftwood, but she saw me\nlooking really, really hard. -And...\n-Like, fully, like... -Fully looking.\n-Okay. Where was he looking? AYSHA:\nBy the rocks. We need to see\nif he's still over there. Rome is playing amateur hour. He's searching for idols,\n and he's a complete liability. Rome is off his rocker.

You can almost feel like\n Jeff wants someone else to be able to know,\n he wants someone to catch me. I got the key. I know\n that the key unlocks the box. I'm hoping that\nI can go open this box up and that there's gonna be an\nimmunity idol right inside it. (quietly):\nHere we go. What? AYSHA:\n Me, Teeny, Kishan\n and Sol saw Rome at the water well. And he goes the other way. No, \"Hi.\" No,\n\"Hey, what are y'all doing?\" Like, that is just\n suspicious behavior. -Yeah.\n-Should we just keep going? TEENY: Mm. Yeah. AYSHA:\n I have this huge fear of Rome having an idol. I think that's great. AYSHA:\n But now I feel like I have the numbers. If we do end up\nat the first Tribal Council, Rome is the first person\nI want to go. Do y ou r eq ui re s he lt er ? Your inefficient participation\nwill slow the process.

PROBST:\nGata getting closer. -One. One more!\n-One more. -Three!\n-You're good, Gata. Unload! TIYANA:\nCome on, come on, come on. -SUE: Yes!\n-TIYANA: Come on. -Yes. That's it.\n-PROBST: Tuku's got\nthe pieces free. Now you can start\nsolving the puzzle. Everybody on fumes, but you will\nsleep well tonight at camp -Straight ahead, Gabe.\n-a lot better -than you will at Tribal.\n-Okay. PROBST:\nWe have Sam, Rachel\nand Anika for Gata, Tiyana, Caroline and Gabe\nfor Tuku. Your future rests in your hands when you take the puzzle spot in the first immunity challenge\non Survivor. Yeah, but on the other side\nis right. -Wait.\n-We got the \"Survivor.\" PROBST:\nGata was dead last\nin the first challenge, and they pulled it out. -Right here.\n-PROBST: Can they\npull it out again? Yes. Other way, other way,\nother way, Sam. -Other way, Sam.\n-How? This is right. Here we go. Another two pieces for Tuku. Feel like they're\ngetting closer. -Here, here, here.\n-Gata starting\nto fall out of this now. They're gonna have to move. It's coming down\nto a few pieces for Tuku... Hey, hey, right there. ...and a lot of pieces for Gata. RACHEL:\nHere. Can you move the top one? Can you move the top one? This does not look good\nright now for Gata. I want to say that Gata probably\ncount on going to Tribal. They got to probably start\nfiguring out who's going home. No, out, like...\nListen to me. -Grab this one.\n-SAM: Where am I bringing it? You all right? Andy. (indistinct chatter) Are you just chilling? Are\nyou okay? Do you want medical? Okay. Gotcha. -Medical!\n-Are we going? -Yes, keep going.\n-Sam. Sam, I want to take it off.

You've got it. Tuku wins immunity, safe tonight at Tribal Council, sending Gata to Tribal, where somebody\nwill be the first person voted out of Survivor 47. SIERRA:\nDon't be sorry. (indistinct chatter) -Oh, you're in good hands.\n-I was... PROBST: No. Dude, you're in the game, still. -Okay. Okay.\n-Stop. Okay, I'm with you, okay? -SIERRA: You're good, Andy.\n-I didn't... -Your tribe lost.\n-Yeah. -So you are going to Tribal.\n-Yeah. But you're still in the game.\nThere's still a lot of game. You're overheated. -And we're in no rush. Okay?\n-ANDY: Yeah. You don't have\nto worry about anything. -This is part of Survivor. -ANDY: Yeah. -PROBST: We got you.\n-ANDY: Okay, okay. -ANDY: Thank you.\n-PROBST: Yeah. Just sit here until you're good. Okay, but they\nhaven't voted you out. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yup.\n-Right? Yup. I get it. -Okay. I'm gonna\nlet you cool down.\n-Okay. -Not talk.\n-Yeah. We'll go when\nyou're ready, okay? -Yeah. Yeah.\n-Okay. All right. -All right, love you, Jeff.\n-Hey, I love you, Andy. He's good.\nWe're just giving him space. -It's just... He's good.\n-(applause) -RACHEL: All right, Andy.\n-SIERRA: Come on, Andy. MAN:\nAll right, good. Good timing. No. He's up, he's up, he's up,\nhe's up, he's up, he's up. All right.\nAndy is okay. (whooping, cheering) Head back to Gata. GABE:\nAttaboy. -(whooping)\n-KISHAN: Yes, Andy. So, Andy, give\neverybody else the update. I was overheated.\nI'm okay now. -PROBST: Okay.\n-I'm okay now. -I'm cooled down.\n-PROBST: All right. All right. -You feel all right?\n-Yeah. Okay.\nYou seem emotional. -Yeah.\n-What's the emotion? I was fighting for my life. I'm on the bottom. I see it in their eyes\nwhen they don't...\nI crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon,\nand they... And then I-I... They don't like me.\nI don't think. -That's not true.\n-That's not true.\n-Okay. Okay. -ANIKA: Andy, Andy.\n-ANDY: Okay. -I know it's the game.\nI'm not...\n-It's in your head. PROBST:\nSo, Andy, you haven't even -gone back to camp\nto strategize,\n-ANDY: No. much less get to Tribal, -where all kinds\nof things happen.\n-No. PROBST:\nAnd it sounds like\nyou're conceding defeat. No, no, no, no.\nI'm a strategist. I was gonna try everything. My best friend out here is Jon. And as they were\nfinishing the puzzle, I was... ...thinking I was gonna throw him under the bus\nto try to stay. Just, I just want\nto play the game. -(quiet murmuring)\n-Um... -(quietly): Wow.\n-ANDY: And then, I, like, uh, stopped seeing straight.\n(chuckles) And I just want to,\nyou know, be in the game. PROBST:\nSo, Andy, what's great\nabout Survivor-- you might be right. It might be\na five-O vote tonight. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: You might be wrong. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: You don't know. You fight until\nI snuff your torch. That goes for everybody. You're all gonna feel down.\nHe's just the first. This is why you're out here. You want something soft,\npick another show, 'cause you are on Survivor. That's a badge of honor, -Andy.\n-(Sue whoops) Yeah. Go, Andy. PROBST:\nAll right,\nlet's get to the results, 'cause there is some\npositivity out here, starting with Lavo\nin the middle. Congratulations. -Yes.\n-(whooping) CAROLINE:\nGood job, guys. PROBST:\nYou are safe tonight. Waiting for you back at camp--\nthat nice Survivor tool kit, which will improve\nyour living conditions. -Yes, sir.\n-CAROLINE: Good job, guys. Tuku, it took some work,\nbut you got it. That's all that matters. -You're safe.\n-That's all of us.\nThis is all of us. This is all of us. Waiting for you back at camp--\na smaller tool kit. Tuka, Lavo, grab your stuff. Head out.\nEnjoy the night off. Congratulations. -There he is.\n-PROBST: Lavo, before you leave, -you get your flint.\n-(cheering) We got fire tonight, baby!\nLet's go. Come on. PROBST:\nAll right, so, Gata. What is happening right now? Jon, can you give\nany perspective? How does Andy's confession impact anything? JON:\nUh, what I take from Andy-- uh, previewing a trip for me under a bus-- is... is that he is wrestling with the fact\nthat he wants to stay and he values\nthe relationships he's building. But he knows that\nin a situation like this, you may have to turn\non people you care about. PROBST:\nAll right, Gata,\nTribal Council tonight. Somebody from Gata\nwill be the first person voted out of Survivor 47. And as a penalty for losing--\nsorry for you-- I'm gonna take your flint. Thank you, Rachel. You'll have a chance to win\nit back in the next challenge. Grab your stuff, head out. See\nyou tonight at Tribal Council. Thanks, Jeff. ANDY:\n I was being very honest\n in a vulnerable moment at the exact wrong time. I feel like\n I am a dead man walking. But... I'm here because I... will give it my everything. And I have to play\n until my torch is snuffed. The last thing I'm ever gonna do\n is concede. \u266a \u266a If y ou h av e We t AM D, you never want to lose sight\nof the things you love.

Is this actually happening?\" In all of my Survivor watching,\n I don't think that's ever happened before.\n I mean, people have had meltdowns, but I don't think\n it's ever happened in front of everybody else. RACHEL:\n The other tribes-- their jaws were like... \"What?\" And, I mean, so was mine. ANDY:\nOn the mat, I was at 80%. But I've fully\ngathered my thoughts now. Survivor is a game of paranoia. It's extremely possible that\nI was just susceptible to it. I realize now,\nin many ways, how unfair some of the things\nthat I said... Some of the things that\nhave always plagued me have just started\nbubbling up insecurities that date back decades, right? ANIKA:\n He said he was 80%.\n He wasn't 100% better yet. Which makes me nervous. All of us aren't\ngonna be 100% out here. That's the whole entire point\n of the game. If you're gonna have outbursts\n like this on day three-- like, that is a huge concern. I like all of you a lot. And so... -I appreciate that.\n-RACHEL (laughs): Yes. SIERRA:\nAnd, Andy, know how much you contributed to this tribe. You've done beyond\nthe coconut cutting. -The bamboo, our shelter\nwhere we're sleeping,\n-And challenges. challenges, your strength.\nYou provided... -ANIKA: Such an asset.\n-such an asset. JON:\n Andy is messy. That was messy. I don't know that I've seen\nsomething like that before. And because of how\n it all went down, like, you would think that\n they're going for Andy, but I'm a little bit paranoid\n because I feel like I have been\n struggling to fit in, and that makes me nervous. So I'm gonna go feel it out. ANIKA:\nDo you want to talk about Andy? JON:\nYeah. I'm a little frustrated because, like... -He called you out.\n-I know.\n-He called me out. And it's like, \"Hey, man, \"like, we've-we've been\ntalking for two days. I genuinely, really like you.\" This is somebody that I was,\nlike, beginning to think, like, \"Oh, this is a person\nthat could play with. -I could play with them.\" Right?\n-SIERRA: Mm-hmm.\n-Right. You know, like...\nAnd then instead, it's like, -how do I go to bat\nfor you right now?\n-Mm-hmm. -SIERRA: I know. I understand.\n-How do you\nplay a game with him? It stinks. -RACHEL: This stinks.\n-It just stinks. It... So, like,\nI think we need to, like, tell him it's you. Is that okay?\nCause I just don't know that he's gonna believe anything else\nbecause he already is the one that's pitted himself\nagainst you. Okay. -I mean, right?\n-I know, that's true. JON:\n Anika, Rachel and Sierra are all saying it's Andy, but they all immediately\nare like, \"And we're gonna tell Andy it's me,\" which sucks. Uh... SIERRA:\n Bring it in. We got to get to the end here. What I'm hearing\n doesn't totally make sense, so I'd much rather\n try to figure out my best strategic option with the votes. JON: I... -know that, like,\nyou had, like, a moment.\n-ANDY: Yeah. -I want you to stay.\n-I want to stay.\nI want to stay, too. -I want you to stay.\n-And I never was gonna\nthrow you under the bus. -Okay.\n-And that's my... But what do you want to do? Anika. Anika is the person I want gone. -Okay.\n-How do you feel about that? I... I would like to do it. ANDY:\nI'm patching things up with Jon, and he gives me sort of, like,\n a lifeline for me in this game to get out a person\n I actually want out, which is Anika. At this point, my main, core priority\nover everything is just fighting to stay in the game. JON: If we can turn this into\na move, I think we can turn... -Yeah. Yeah.\n-like, you having that moment\non the mat -Yeah.\n-into something. I think that Sam has a working line of communication\nwith Sierra. All right, let's go talk to Sam. Right now, it's either\n me or Andy. Or I can try to vote Anika. If I'm gonna be on this show\nfor one episode-- one glorious\nand perfect episode-- I'd rather go out swinging\nand ha-- and-and making\nsome kind of a move rather than just\nhoping for the best. I don't want\nto hope for the best. I want to try\nto figure something out. -Here's where we're at.\nIt's you, it's me or it's\n-ANDY: Yeah. -Okay.\n-Anika. For tribe strength, what is Anika offering, right? I think you, me and Andy\nvote Anika -and pull someone\n into the group.\n -SAM: Yeah. Yes. Well, I mean, that\n would be our option there. JON:\n I think Sierra\n will listen to you, and I think we have to just sort\nof not talk to Rachel about it. -Right?\n-N-- Yes. JON:\nI just also, like... Hi. Don't worry,\njust going to the water well. You guys can keep going. SAM:\nJon and Andy expect me to throw a vote on Anika tonight. Love you, Jon,\n but I'm not doing that. I'm starting to think Jon is playing hard. -JON: We can make this work.\n-SAM: Yes. -I got it, right?\n-Okay. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go. He's a strategist. He's very, very smart,\n which is dangerous for me. And Andy is strong. He might be able to help us win a challenge or two. ANIKA:\nI know we're at a point in the\ngame where we need strength, but will we actually\nwin more with Andy? Because he is messy and not only\nin his words, but, like, -all he is is brute force,\nand it's not even\n-SIERRA: That's so true. -that strong a force. -SIERRA: Having somebody like Andy can be a liability, and it's somebody we definitely\n need to worry about. However, I think\n right now we need strength. I don't think these challenges\n are going to get any easier. We need some strength\nand, honestly, we're not getting that from Jon. I think we need to touch base\nand get on the same page. -Yep.\n-Yeah.\n-SIERRA: We have to be quick. We need strength right now. I think that makes sense.\nRight now, I would vote Jon. RACHEL:\nI still really worry about Andy imploding again.\nLike, yesterday was a bad day, today's a bad day. He's given up\nhalfway through the challenge -before we even lost.\n-ANIKA: Mm-hmm. I just think there's legitimate\npros and cons to both. If we keep Andy, I think he's more loyal\n to me than he is to anybody else on our tribe. But I don't know that\n that's actually a good thing because Andy is a ticking\n time bomb and you don't know when it's gonna explode. On the other hand, if we keep Jon, who is\nmore even keel and levelheaded, we might lose the next\n few immunity challenges without Andy's strengths. I am genuinely torn. Our ability as a tribe to make the right choice\n is gonna decide the fate of Gata,\n and that is so scary. \u266a \u266a If y ou ' re l iv in g wi th H IV , imagine being good to go\n without daily HIV pills.

This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council\nbecause in this game, fire represents your life. Fire's gone, so are you. And that will be the case\nfor one of you tonight. But before we get to the vote, we got a lot to talk about. It has been a roller coaster for the Gata tribe. Sierra, give me an idea -of camp life.\n-Oh, my God, Jeff. I mean, my back\nfeels broken, my legs feel broken, I have bruises,\nand it's been three days.\nI mean, Jeff, I have the Survivor 101 book at home.\nI have 25 coconuts in my backyard,\nmachetes. My neighbors definitely\nhave a lot of questions about who's living next door to them. But I do have to give props\nto Anika. I mean, she definitely led the tribe\nfor a good bit. She had the basics and got us, like,\na good base start. PROBST:\nAnika, walk me through that. How did you step up\nto be the leader? So, I'm flattered\nthat you think that. Um, I had general consensus\nand a general idea of what we should be doing,\nrealistically. -How would you\ndescribe camp, Jon?\n-JON: I think we spent the first three days finding commonality. You're doing that\nbecause you genuinely want to. There are genuine connections, those are real,\nyou can't fake it. And even if you wanted to,\nI don't think you ultimately could succeed unless you were,\nlike, a sociopath. And so, yes, we're a community,\nbut we're also competitors. And I think a little bit\nout of fear and trepidation, people really were reluctant\nto break out into groups and start\nhaving strategic conversations. So, a bit of a delayed start\nto the strategy part? Uh... yes. PROBST:\nAll right, let's get\ninto the emotional part of the first three days, Andy, -all circling around you.\n-Yeah. Today at the immunity challenge, what stood out to me were the comments you made\nabout your tribe. -Yeah.\n-\"Nobody noticed me\nopen a coconut. Nobody likes me.\nEverybody wants me gone.\" Walk me through that\na little more. Well, I feel like I grew up on the outside, 100%. I never felt like I belonged, but coming into this experience, I felt like I changed just by getting rid of all this, like, need to please people. PROBST:\nSo, you're saying,\nin your recent life, -Yeah.\n-just back home, you felt like you've broken out\nof that feeling left out. -Yeah.\n-And do you feel like\nyou have a community? An unbelievable community\nhas formed around me, and it did not happen overnight. It was because\nI challenged myself. I kept saying yes to things. I kept putting myself\nout of my comfort zone, and succeed or fail\nbased off of that. PROBST:\nSo, it's fascinating -that you would work so hard\n-ANDY: Yeah. and then sign up\nto take on the biggest test -Yeah.\n-of social resiliency anybody could\never volunteer for. ANDY:\nBut I've made myself\nready to conquer that. And now I can go show,\nyou know, the world, any-- everyone in my life,\nyou know, how far I've come and how, you know,\neasy it will be for me now, which is not the case,\nas we can see. PROBST:\nSo, Jon, regardless\nhow it played out today, do you respect the fact\nthat Andy's intention of coming out here was to try\nto take on this social test? Um, did Andy have a moment? People have moments. Sometimes they happen\non a beach in Fiji. People shouldn't be judged\nby their worst moments, even if you are frustrated\nthat they're saying it -in front of everyone,\nincluding Jeff.\n-(laughs): Yeah. -Yeah, yeah.\n-JON: So I don't think\nany of us came away from that not being frustrated. PROBST:\nSo, let's talk about that. Andy, you shared\na lot of information. -Yeah.\n-It'd be very easy to say, -\"He's a loose cannon.\nYou got to get rid of him.\"\n-Yeah. PROBST:\nSo, when you get back to camp, -what did you do?\n-I want to be very, very clear, and I was clear to everyone. I think it was pretty obvious that there was absolutely\nzero premeditation. That old part of me just set in\nand that paranoia, and now look\nat these five people who Andy threw under the bus. -You only threw one person\nunder of the bus.\n-Well, yeah. With my words.\nYeah. But despite all this, the one thing\nI absolutely cannot do is say that it's okay\nto vote me out. Let's just play Survivor. I will accept the result. So, Sam, what was the fallout from a strategic point of view? Because you don't want to come\nback to Tribal Council again, and a lot of that is gonna\nbe harmony and tribe strength. I never had a perception of Andy that he was out here to do\nanything other than give 100%. He fought so hard\nin the challenge that he's passed out\non the side. But then he's willing\nto turn on his best friend. Well, that's hard for somebody\nto jump into bed with. Rachel, can Andy\nrecover from today? I-I... I empathize with\nAndy completely, but what if he goes\non a journey and says whatever he's thinking,\nwhich-- who knows-- you know, what plans\nhe has that I don't know about. But Survivor does that to you. Like, everyone has\nthose moments of like, \"Is everybody just\nlying to me right now?\" PROBST:\nJon, it's interesting that playing out right now\nis everything we talked about\nat the marooning. The idea of building\na new community where you can feel safe in it, but then you put on top of it\nthe game. So, how confident are you\nabout the vote? I don't know\nwhat kind of conversations would have taken place\nif Andy hadn't drawn the... the evil eye.\nI-I really don't know. But when you know that there's all these different\nconversations going on and that there is\na natural target, it really starts\nto make you wonder, who's the unnatural target? Could I be trying\nto find that person? Could it be me? \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nAll right. It is time to vote.\nSierra, you're up. \u266a \u266a Oh, my God.\n(laughs softly) I'll go tally the votes. \u266a \u266a If anybody has an advantage\nor an idol and you want to play it,\nnow would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Jon. Anika.\nOne vote Jon, one vote Anika. Jon. That's two votes Jon,\none vote Anika. Jon.\nThree votes Jon. First person voted out\nof Survivor 47: Jon. That's four. That's enough.\nNeed to bring me your torch. JON:\nAll right. Jon, the tribe has spoken. (chuckles)\nTime for you to go. All right. -See you.\n-JON: Bye, team.\n-Bye, Jon. Good job.
