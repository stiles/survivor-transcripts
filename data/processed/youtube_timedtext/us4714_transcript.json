    "transcript": "Welcome to the final episode\nof Survivor 47. It's been a wild ride\nthese last few days, starting with Operation Italy. That took out Caroline\nand flipped the game. And that sent Rachel\ninto stealth mode, literally crawling\nthrough the sand like a spy to listen in on Sam and Andy and Genevieve and Teeny as they plotted her demise. So, armed with that knowledge, she made the biggest move\nof the season. Played her Block a Vote\nand her idol, took out Andy in a revenge vote,\nflipped the game again. Then Rachel won her third\nindividual immunity challenge and used that leverage\nto take out Genevieve. And now we're down to four: Rachel, Sue, Teeny and Sam. Two of them are gonna\nsit right here. The other two\nwill be forced to make fire to earn that third spot. Then the final three will\nface their jury and get a chance to plead their case about\nwhy they deserve the title of Sole Survivor and the million\ndollars that comes with it. And then we will crown a winner\nof Survivor 47. And immediately following that,\nwe're gonna stay right here in this beautiful Tribal Council\nand do the aftershow. It is a very big night\nfor Survivor. It's the finale of Survivor 47. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... I find out so much. \u266a \u266a Oh, my God. I trust her.\n She shared so much with me. My loyalty to Rachel is real. If anybody has an advantage or an idol\nand you want to play it... Jeff? I'd like to play it for myself. First vote: Rachel.\nDoes not count. Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member\nof our jury: Andy. The tribe has spoken. All eyes on Rachel right now.\nDoes she have it? -Good girl.\n-And she does. It's over! Rachel has won her third individual immunity. RACHEL:\n Oh, my God. I won immunity\nwhen I needed it so bad. I've never felt more confident\nthat I'm less confident in what's going to happen. Genevieve just\nspun me around in circles, and I'm sick of it. Fourteenth person voted out and the seventh member\nof our jury: Genevieve. The tribe has spoken. They have. \u266a \u266a -TEENY: Final four.\n-Oh, my God. Final four, guys. TEENY:\n I am ecstatic. I'm in the final four\nof Survivor-- my dream of all time. -We did it!\n-Come on! Final four! -Final four.\n-Final four. TEENY:\n And I am one round away from having a chance\nto pitch my case to win. Genevieve is gone.\nI just want to say -It's so crazy.\n-congrats to all of us. -I know.\n-That girl was a legend. And Genevieve is gone. So, right now, I am riding the highest high of my entire 23 years of life. TEENY:\nThere were...\nHow many people have we beaten? -Fourteen.\n-How did that happen? My daughter Chelsea's\n last text to me was, \"Mom, I want you to know, \"if you get voted out\nthe first day, we're still so proud of you.\" And now I'm here\nin the final four. (laughs) -You guys, final four.\n-RACHEL: Final four. SUE:\n It's the craziest thing, and I want to scream\n at the top of my lungs. Ah! Sam, we got to final four and we never\nwrote each other's name down. -Yeah. How about that?\n-I'm pretty proud of us. SAM: I'm at the final four\n of Survivor, and it's this weird, like, hybrid\nof being fulfilled and being motivated. -How you feeling, Sam?\n-Feeling like, uh... big day tomorrow. Because my dream was not\n to come on Survivor and get fourth place. My dream was\n to be the Sole Survivor, and I really feel like\nI'm one day away. We're gonna wake up\non day 25 on Survivor. What a concept. Tonight I'm just, like, happy and feel\nin a celebratory mood and just, like,\nwant to kind of take it all in. The last few votes,\n I've had to win to survive, and I'm not gonna stop competing now. I feel like this\n immunity challenge coming up is the last stand,\n the final battle for the four of us, and it's the most important\n of them all. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a Come on in! What in the world? PROBST:\nTake it in. This is what stands between you\nand a million dollars. Four big smiles. They're nervous smiles, Jeff. Yeah, they're scared smiles. They should be. Wow. So, here we are, day 25. You've made it\nto the final four. You have one\nimmunity challenge left. Shall we just get to it? -(all voicing assent)\n-All right. First things first, Rachel. For the third time, got to take back the necklace. -Thank you.\n-RACHEL: Thank you. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,\n you're gonna crawl under a muddy net. You'll then use a long pole\n to unweave a rope. Once you have that rope, you'll use it to lower a gate. You'll run through it and\n collect a bag of letter tiles. You'll need those tiles\n to solve a combination lock. That'll release a machete. You'll use the machete\n to drop the ladder, climb to the finish\n where you will race to solve a hanging bat puzzle. First person\nto finish wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot\nin the final three. You will be\nat that Final Tribal Council, where you will get a chance\nto plead your case to your jury about why you deserve the title\nof Sole Survivor and the million dollars\nthat comes with it. You also have power\nbecause you decide who sits next to you\nin that second spot and who you force to make fire\nto earn that final spot. Which means one of the four of\nyou will be forced to make fire and you're gonna lose and your dream is gonna fall one day short. Only way to prevent that\nfrom happening: win right now. Yeah. PROBST:\nBiggest challenge of the season. We'll draw for spots.\nWe'll get it on. All right, here we go. For immunity, guaranteed spot\nin the final three, Survivors ready? Go! First, you're going\nback through mud again. -(grunting)\n-Day 25, Survivor 47. -You want it,\n-(grunting) this is where you step up -and grab it.\n-(grunts) Sam through, Rachel's through,\nTeeny's through. Come on, Sue! Let's dig! (grunting) PROBST: Now you're gonna untie a long pole and use it\nto unweave a rope. You need that rope. Sam has his pole. That pole has\na little bit of a U. You can use that U\nto grab that rope and push it up\nand over those pegs. It is Sam in the early lead. Rachel's starting\nto get the hang of it. Teeny doing a nice job. Sue has her first bit of rope. Sam figuring it out. Once you're there,\nknock off the ball. Sam has his. Now you got to untie more knots,\nget through that little gate. Rachel has hers. It is Sam and Rachel. You should be used\nto these knots by now. They are a staple on Survivor. Sam is through his knots. Rachel's through hers. Sam and Rachel pulling ahead. Gonna use that ball\nto try to lower the gate. Sam almost does it\nwith his first shot. Rachel just misses. Here comes Teeny working\non her knots. Sue working on her knots. You got to figure out the slack, 'cause you need that ball\nto travel. -Ah.\n-PROBST: Sam's a little short. -(grunting)\n-PROBST: Here comes\nTeeny and Sue. Everybody in this. -Sue launches. No.\n-Aah! -(grunts)\n-Teeny launches. PROBST:\nRachel has a shot if she can get it to come down. Close. Will it work? Rachel's done it!\nShe's through first! (grunts) Rachel now working\non her letter tiles. It is Rachel in the lead. Big immunity on the line. Everybody fighting right now. Gonna use the letter tiles, try\nto solve that combination lock. -Aah!\n-Sam still trying\nto lower his gate. -(grunts)\n-Teeny's still working\non her gate. Sue working on her gate. Sue... lowers her gate. Let's go, Sue! -(grunts)\n-PROBST: Sue falling through. That's 25 days\nof exhaustion on Survivor. Rachel still in the lead. You've got letter tiles\nto help you solve this. You've got a clue. Teeny and Sam still struggling. Now is when\nyou really feel that pressure. (grunts) PROBST:\nTeeny drops her gate. Teeny now working\non the letter tiles. Here goes Sam. Sam very close.\nCan he get it to drop? Sam has his gate!\nYou're through. We got a challenge! Got a clue,\nyou've got letter tiles. You're trying\nto solve that one word. Sam quickly gets\nhis letter tiles. Everybody now\non the combination lock. It's a word this time,\nnot numbers. It's what you need to do now. Sam thinks he has it. And he does.\nSam got it very fast. Covers his word up\nso nobody can see it. Sam, with one swat,\nknocks down his ladder. Rachel has it. Does not cover it... -Ah!\n-PROBST: ...leaving it open. Now Rachel's gonna cover it. Sam heading up\nto work on that bat puzzle. Rachel drops hers.\nGot to get through the knots. Teeny solved it. It is Sam in the lead. Rachel now heading up\nher ladder. Teeny trying to drop her ladder. PROBST:\nSue has the word. Still taking her a while\nto get it. She's got it now. Rachel now joins Sam. -(Teeny grunts)\n-PROBST: Sue will be\nup here soon. Teeny's now trying\nto drop her ladder. Still working with that machete. Sam did it in one swat. Sue has hers.\nShe's heading up. -Let's go, Teeny!\n-(grunts) Here comes Sue. Sam with another piece\non this bat puzzle. PROBST: It would be Sam's first individual immunity win\nof the season. Rachel's at three. Teeny drops hers!\nEverybody's still in this. One piece at a time. Sam with another piece. Here comes Teeny. Sue is quickly\ngetting into this puzzle. Sue has won\none individual immunity. Teeny has not won. Sam has not won. We know Rachel's story.\nShe's trying to tie a record. Four women have won\nfour immunity challenges, but Sam is ripping\nthrough this early. Puzzles have not\nbeen his friend so far, but today might be\na different story. Teeny looking for another piece. Sue trying to find one. It is Rachel and Sam right now\nside by side and very close. Rachel with another piece. Sam looking\nto place another piece. Will it fit? No! Rachel with another piece. And another. Now Rachel in the lead over Sam. Sue is in it, down on the end. Teeny's in it. Teeny, just gonna go right next\ndoor. \"I'm just gonna look.\" Now Sam's doing the same thing. No pride on Survivor. What that means is\nyou're looking at somebody else's puzzle. That means you are trailing. Rachel with another piece. Rachel starting\nto pull away now. There have been over 350 woman\nthat have played Survivor over 46 seasons. Only four have won\nfour immunity challenges. Rachel down to three pieces. Rachel down to two pieces. Rachel down to her last piece. Rachel thinks she has it. She does not. Something is not right. This challenge is still alive. That is opening the door\nfor everybody else. What is it? Puzzles look right\nwhen they are finished. Your life in the game is\non the line right now. Keep fighting. Rachel making a switch. Is that it? That's it!\nRachel's done it! Claims a spot in the final three and in the Survivor hall of fame. Wow, what a final challenge. Rachel, come on over. For the fourth\nand historic time, immunity is yours. You're in a very\nelite group now. Only five women--\nincluding yourself-- over 46 seasons have won\nfour individual immunities. The biggest thing\nis you are guaranteed a spot in the final three.\nSo, what is the feeling, knowing you accomplished the goal,\nyou made it to the end? I don't have words\nright now, Jeff. I mean, to be standing here\nwith this necklace on-- it's overwhelming\nand it's incredible. And yet, at the same time,\nin my gut, I, like, knew I could do this. And I just think that, like,\neverything I do in life, I do with\nincredible determination. And I didn't know\nif I could do it out here, and I'm so proud that I-I have. -Congratulations.\n-Thank you. So, tonight at Tribal,\nyou have a lot of power 'cause you're gonna decide, between Sam, Teeny and Sue, who you put in that second seat\nat the final three and which two players you force\nto make fire to earn it. You have the afternoon\nto figure out what you're gonna do\nwith that big decision. -Thanks, Jeff.\n-Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight\nat Tribal Council for the final\nfire-making showdown. -Congrats.\n-Thank you. SAM: Rachel wins\n immunity yet again, and I feel defeated. I've tried\n to knock her out of this game, I've tried to beat her\n at a challenge, but my plan has been foiled. And I know pretty much\n immediately I'm making fire\nfor my life tonight. \u266a \u266a TEENY: Ooh. (mutters) RACHEL:\n The feeling right now is a little bit of disbelief that this is where I am\nright now in this game. You're forever\nin the hall of fame. It's... I'm so proud of you. -Thank you.\n-Yeah. That was kick-ass. RACHEL:\n I've tied an immunity record. It never occurred to me\nthat I could win four. -Well, I'm gonna go wash off.\n-I'm gonna go wash off, too. RACHEL:\n And so, the fact that I'm tying Jenna Morasca, Chrissy Hofbeck, Kim Spradlin and Kelly Wiglesworth-- that's so cool.\nBut it also reminds me that\n Kelly and Chrissy didn't win, and they both got to the end. And so, I have to make\n the right decision tonight when it comes to fire-making\n so that I set myself up to truly clinch this win. -I need to go under.\n-RACHEL: Yeah, me too. Let's just do it, okay? Yeah. I mean,\nI can just tell you. Like, you two are going to fire.\nI'm not gonna, like, hold a... No, I know,\nI know, I know, I know. RACHEL:\n Sue has been the only loyal ally I've had in this late stage\n of the game, and this wouldn't feel right\nwithout her sitting next to me in the final three. After tonight, one of us\nwill no longer be in the game. RACHEL:\n And the person I know that I want\n in fire tonight is Sam. He is someone\n that I've been trying to get out for a long time,\n and I think I could put myself into fire\nif I needed to. And I was prepared,\nif I lost the challenge, that I was\ngoing to fire tonight. But I think that when I take a step back\n and I look at my game, I don't think that knocking\n Sam out directly is going to elevate me\n in any substantial way. And Teeny could be a formidable, like, opponent to Sam. You're gonna let me make fire? -Yeah.\n-All right. -I'm down.\n-I'm down, too.\nI have no choice. Like, you don't need\nto be like that. -Like what?\n-Arrogant. I'm not arrogant. \"You're gonna let me make fire?\" My worst-case scenario\n was Rachel winning because I knew that she would\nput me and Sam into fire-making. I've been threatened by Sam since before we even met\nout here on this island, in the sense\nthat he's super smart, he's charismatic, and he knows this game\n like the back of his hand. And a part of this game is fire. -Shut up!\n-I swear, I've never\nmade a fire once. -RACHEL: You've never\nsparked the flint?\n-No. -I don't want\nto hear from you until tonight.\n-It's okay. TEENY:\n Sam is telling us, you know,\n he never practiced fire. But in my mind, it's all a ruse\nto try and get in my head. All right, well,\nI need to practice. It's a shame\nI don't know how to make fire. I'm leaving. TEENY:\n I'm just sick of Sam. And the last thing\n I need right now, when I'm about\nto compete against him in such\na high-pressure situation, is him pulling these mind games\nyet again on me. You just want the, like,\nbest shavings possible. Hold your knife like this. And then put the knife\non the... like, here. -(knife scraping)\n-Yeah. I see what you mean.\nI think I'm getting it. RACHEL:\n I want Teeny sitting with me\n in the final three. And so, I'm like,\n\"I will help you, Teeny.\" You're, like, sparking really\nwell, and you got flame. Okay. Teeny needed a little bit\nof encouragement, and she needed a little bit\n of technique change, and she's killing it. Okay. I hope Sam doesn't know\nwhat he's doing. -I hope Sam doesn't know\nwhat he's doing.\n-Me too. Just go slow. -Thank God that\n Sam sucks at doing fire. -(groans) SUE: We all thought\n Sam was lying to us, that he actually\n has been practicing fire, and that he was gonna be good. He's not good.\nIt's-it's, like, pathetic. He's gonna feel like\nan idiot, honestly. Just take a breath. (exhales) SUE:\nWhat I've seen from Sam today... (scoffs)\nI could easily beat him in fire. But I'm gonna go with\n what Rachel wants to do and just sit\n and be able to relax tonight, knowing that\n I'm going to the end. How's it going? No idea how to do this. I've gone 25 days. I maybe touched a flint\n one time. Very bad for me right now\nbecause now I'm starting to wish I would have done\na little bit more to prepare\n for this potential moment. Like, making fire\n is a foreign concept to me. And it makes me really nervous\n that Teeny has a coach like Rachel who definitely knows\n what she's doing, and I've got no help. I know everybody's\n rooting against me. Guess who's at camp, pissed\nthat he's not getting ...? -I believe him.\n-TEENY: Huh? He doesn't know what he's doing. -He's playing it up.\n-I don't know. Maybe. -But he looked, uh,\ngenuinely annoyed.\n-Thank you. -Genuinely.\n-That actually helps. RACHEL:\n I feel like Teeny has really gotten her confidence up. She's ready to take on Sam. -I'm proud of that.\n-You should be. And I believe she will best him tonight. I think that\n she knows what she's doing. She just has to go in\n and not panic. -Ah.\n-That looks good. RACHEL:\n And have the confidence\n to get this done. That you? Yeah. When I see Teeny is making fire, I'm like, \"Oh, crap.\" I'm in way over my head tonight. I'm scared. I'm worried a little bit,\nyou know? I, uh... You don't want to play 25 days\nand come up that short. And I can... feel it slipping away\na little bit. So... I'm afraid\nof what's gonna happen. I'm afraid\nof looking like an idiot. I'm afraid\nof everybody at home saying, \"Why didn't you practice fire?\" And me saying, \"I don't know.\"\n(laughs) And then I pulled out\n my letters from home, and there was something\n that my dad wrote to me. He had written that he knew I would give it absolutely\n everything I have out here, and that he wasn't\n gonna bet against me. And the thought of him rooting for me... told me,\n \"You're not one to quit.\" That really fired me up. I'm not ready to go home.\n I want to see day 26. I've got to find a way to get myself\n to the end of this game. I'm on Survivor for a reason. The second you let your brain\nstart to get to a point of doubt is the second that you've lost. And I'm not ready\n to go there yet. I-I can't believe it. I made a fire\n and I-I built it up. And that's when I said,\nlet's go into Tribal Council... ...with some momentum\n and let's go to war. \u266a \u266a TEENY:\n Right now, the only thing standing between me... ...and the Final\nTribal Council... TEENY:\n ...and a chance\n at a million dollars... ...is one fire. ...is a flame\nburning through a rope. It is the biggest opportunity I've ever had to change my life\n and accomplish a dream that I've been working towards since I was a conscious,\nliving human being. SAM:\n I have scrapped my way\n all the way to the end of this game\n on my own. So, I'm hoping that\n tonight I can find a way to find a way yet again. \u266a \u266a Now bring in\nthe members of our jury. \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nOkay. So, let's talk\nabout today's challenge. Rachel, you win your fourth individual immunity challenge and in doing so, you accomplish\nthe goal of every player, which is tomorrow night\nat Final Tribal Council, you will get a chance to face\nyour jury and make your case about why you're the player that is most deserving\nof the title of Sole Survivor\nand the million dollars that goes with it. We also have to take a moment to formally acknowledge that, with your fourth\nindividual immunity win, you join a very elite\ngroup of women. Out of 47 seasons and 24 years, only five of you have ever won\nfour individual challenges. Sam, the other side of Rachel winning four\nis the reminder that of the four other women,\nonly two of them won the game. This is not a slam dunk\nthat this season is over. It's just recognizing\na big achievement from a player. Yeah, absolutely.\nLike, I, like everybody else, am overjoyed for Rachel, but at the same time, the necklace doesn't\nwin you a million bucks. And as a player in the game,\nand hopefully, as jury members out of the game, we're able to separate the idea of history that should\nbe recognized and admired and what it takes to outwit, outplay and outlast. And, Rachel, that brings us to\nthe other part of winning today is this power you have\nthat comes with a decision. Which of these three\ndo you give that second spot at the final three\nand which two players do you force to go make fire\nand earn it? RACHEL:\nYeah. I feel like I could go to fire\nand try to take out Sam, but I also feel like I earned this necklace today\nin a challenge and I don't think\nthat I need to give it up to do another challenge\nand prove whatever that proves. I mean, I came into this game being extremely loyal\nto the people that I wanted to ally with. And what I learned\npretty quickly is that none of them\nwere as loyal to me as I was willing\nto be loyal to them until I found Sue. And Sue has genuinely been the most loyal person to me and so I only feel like it is\nfair to bring her to the end. And so Teeny and Sam -will be making fire.\n-PROBST: So, Sue, -you're in the final three.\n-SUE: I am. Thanks to Rachel. PROBST:\nSo, Teeny, two things of note\nthat Rachel said. One is she's rewarding Sue\nfor loyalty. What she also said is, \"I could have taken a shot\nat fire to take out Sam.\" So, does this create an\nopportunity for you? Does this surprise you? What do you\nmake of that statement? Um, I feel like I have an acute sense of awareness of what these people\nthink of me, how they underestimate me\nin this game, but it doesn't matter, necessarily, what these people think of me.\nIt matters what these people think of me\nand it matters that I get to the point to be able to pitch my case. So, this is absolutely\nan opportunity. And it's funny that it's me\nand Sam because I would say Sam and I have had\na complicated relationship, and it's more my end of things. \"It's not you, it's me\"? Yes, absolutely.\nI would say that I've had a bit\nof a one-sided rivalry with Sam, and to open up\nabout it honestly is that I look at Sam\nand I see a handsome, smart, athletic, strong guy. And Sam's somebody who,\nprobably when he was younger, got a lot of, like,\nattention from girls. The teachers wanted him\nto be the kid who was, like, moving the desks\naround the classroom. -Moving desks?\n-And, like, that's\nkind of the thing that I always wanted\nto be doing, and, because of, you know,\nmy identity and my gender, just to say it, like, that's not\nnecessarily the experience I've gotten, and I've worked\nreally hard to get to a place where I'm more confident in,\nlike, this version of myself and how I present\nto the world now. And I'm still\nworking through things. So, when I see Sam,\nhe's done nothing, honestly, throughout this game\nbut try and work with me. But I've projected\ninsecurities onto him and I've tried to get him out, on top of the fact\nthat I do see Sam as a threat and a really good Survivor player, too. So, right now,\nthe two of us making fire, it's an opportunity\nfor one final showdown. And if I can beat him, that's a great end\nto the story for me. And if I can't, then\nI'll have more to say after. PROBST:\nSam, how about for you? Opportunity? Yeah, I-I'm excited\nfor the opportunity. I'm at peace\nwith the result tonight. I'm ready to plead my case. I'm ready to fight like hell. Uh, last I checked, yeah, my torch\nstill has fire in it, so I'm ready to go. PROBST:\nAll right. So, here's how it's gonna work.\nTeeny and Sam, you're gonna take a spot\nat the fire-making stations. Pick whichever one you want. Oh. PROBST:\nI'm gonna give you both a minute to take a look at your supplies, figure out how you're gonna\nstart this fire-making showdown, and then we'll go. Sam? All right, it is time for the fire-making showdown between Teeny and Sam. Each have the same job:\ncreate a fire that burns high enough\nand hot enough to burn through that rope and raise a flag.\nYou do that, you're in the final three. You don't, you're out and become the eighth member\nof our jury. Are you ready to begin? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. Good luck. Begin. Takes three things\nto make a fire. You need fuel. That can come\nfrom the magnesium. That can come\nfrom the husk you're using. You need heat. That's gonna come from striking that flint. And then you need air. Fire's got to breathe\nin order to burn. Lots of different ways\nto approach making a fire. Both players prepping\na little bed, now scraping magnesium. That's a great igniter. And you get the heat you need from striking that flint and get a little bit of a spark. Teeny has a baby flame.\nCan she get it? -That hessian\nis limited in supply.\n-Yes. There you go. PROBST: It'll burn quickly. And it'll burn out just as fast. Key is you got\nto make something happen while you have the flame. Teeny is nursing that fire, adding little pieces\nof kindling. It looks like it might be\npositioned just under that rope, which is where you want it. PROBST: Sam continues to work, trying to get\nhis first real flame. Teeny has kept her fire going\nand it's starting to increase. She's adding more sticks. This could be\na million-dollar fire. PROBST:\nTeeny's fire continues to burn. Sam yet to get a flame. Still a long way from burning\nthrough that rope with that wind starting to blow.\nThat's gonna be a factor. Sam now feeling the desperation, trying to get it to spark\nand hope it ignites. PROBST: Teeny is doing a nice\njob, slowly nursing that fire. Now that flame's starting\nto burn higher, nicking that rope. Sam continues to try\nto fight to get in this. Teeny's flame is now starting\nto hit that rope. You can see the fibers\non that rope lighting up. Little by little,\nthat rope is getting frayed. There's another burn\nof the rope. It's right under the rope now. Sam needs to get something\ngoing to have a shot at this. Sam's got a flame going now. Sam trying\nto get back into this. He's got to make something\nout of that flame quickly. Can he nurse that\ninto something? Teeny's fire now with a gust\nof wind. That helps. -Yeah.\n-Keep going. PROBST: Anything that lifts it\ncloser to the rope. She's got a good foundation. Sam is trying\nto build a foundation without smothering it. Blow, blow. PROBST: Sam is trying\nto get his going higher. Can he catch Teeny\nand make a game of this? Teeny adds another stick\nand another. That flame is burning\nall around that rope. Sam's got a flame going now. Can he catch Teeny?\nWe got a showdown now. Two fires. This is very close. Teeny and Sam\nfor a spot in the final three. Teeny's rope continues to burn. It's got to break\nand pop that flag. Sam is right there in it. He's trying to get that flame,\ncoaxing it up. -Come on!\n-PROBST: Teeny has an inferno. Teeny is all over that rope. It's only a matter of time\nbefore it pops. Would be a huge comeback if Sam could burn his rope\nbefore Teeny's. Sam's got a big fire.\nHe's burning his rope. -Now the wind is blowing Teeny's\naway from the rope\n-No! -and Sam's into the rope.\n-Yo.\n-No! -PROBST: Unbelievable\nturn of events!\n-Come on, baby. This could come down\nto seconds being the difference. Come on, baby. -Let's go!\n-PROBST: Sam pulls it out! -Come on!\n-An unbelievable comeback -in the 25th day of season 47.\n-Holy cow. -Oh, my God!\n-PROBST: Sam will earn a spot in the final three,\nand a dejected Teeny. -Find a way to find a way!\n-PROBST: Wow. Never seen\na fire-making challenge -that close, ever, on Survivor. -Wow. You did really well, Teeny. All right, Teeny and Sam,\ntake your spots back over here. (sniffles) Teeny, it takes so much to get on Survivor. It takes so much\nto get through day one, then day two, all the way to day 25. All the things you've endured\nto get to this spot and to get that close\nand to still fall short. It's the stakes of Survivor. But it doesn't mean\nit's not terribly disappointing. So, what is the feeling\nright now? (sniffles) Obviously, I'm heartbroken, and... it is something I'll have to deal with forever-- that right there, that rope still not burned. But I'm at peace as well, because I played this game exactly how I always knew\nthat I would. I played this game\nexactly how I live my life. I played this game 100% as Teeny because that's the only way\nthat I know how to be. And at least\nI can go out now saying that I believe I would have won\nif I got there, -and I'll just never know.\n-(laughing) Um, and, as I said, losing\nto the big handsome jock-- it's just another part\nof the story that I got to deal with. PROBST:\nWell, Teeny, I got to say, it's been a pleasure\nhaving you on the show. I respect everybody\nwho plays Survivor. I've never played, but I've been a witness\nto every single person who has played this game\nfor 24 years. And I continue\nto learn life lessons from all of you,\nincluding you this season. So, thank you\nfor braving Survivor and coming out here and\nfulfilling your childhood dream. Jeff, thank you\nfor giving it to me. I can't even believe I'm looking\nat you in the eyes right now. And that is something that\nI will carry with me forever. So, I'm happy.\nI know I did my best. There's nothing more\nI could have done, and that's how I'll go on. And fittingly, in Survivor, the other side\nof this story is you, Sam. Teeny gave it everything\nshe had. She came up short. You looked like you had absolutely no shot to even get a flame.\nDid you have any moments where you said, \"I'm done.\nI'm not gonna get there\"? The moment that\nyou let your brain get to, \"I'm out,\" it's self-fulfilling, in a way. But I think\nthe story of my game... ...has been one of resilience, so, I'm elated. PROBST:\nAll right, Teeny, it's time.\nNeed to grab your torch. SUE:\nCan we have hugs? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. (indistinct, quiet chatter) Bring it in, brother. -I'm proud of you.\n-Thanks. You too. Never wanted to do this. But it's a part of the journey. It's a part of the journey. Teeny, the tribe has spoken. -Time for you to go.\n-Thanks, Jeff. -Thanks for being out.\n-Thank you for letting me. -You smell good.\n-(Probst laughs) -Bye, Teeny.\n-Good luck, guys. Rachel, Sue, Sam,\ncongratulations. You made it to the final three. Tomorrow night, as you know, the power in this game\nnow shifts to the jury. Eight players that\nyou had a hand in voting out will decide who wins this game. Prepare, be ready. You have one more night\nhere in Fiji. Try to get some sleep. You're gonna need it.\nGrab your torches. Head back to camp.\nWe'll see you tomorrow night. -RACHEL: Good night.\n-SAM: Good night. TEENY:\n I do think that moment will haunt me\nfor the rest of my time on Earth.\n But I've had to overcome a lot of emotional\n hardships out here. Throughout my life,\nI've obtained this sort of sidekick energy. And out here I've learned to,\nyou know, be my own best friend, and it'll help me\n live my real life in ways I never did before. \u266a \u266a -SUE: Day 26!\n -RACHEL: Day 26! SAM: Talk about an alarm clock.\n Hello. -SUE: Good morning, sunshine!\n -SAM: Good morning. SUE: Final three. I want to scream! I'm so pumped!\nI'm so pumped. I'm final three. Today is actually\n my birthday, and I'm 59 today. -RACHEL: Oh, my God!\n -SAM: I see -a big old thing.\n-(Rachel shouts)\n-Oh! RACHEL:\nOh, my God!\nChocolate croissants! What?! RACHEL:\n It was glorious. I've had some\ngood rewards out here, but this was just special. -Survivor 47.\n-47. Survivor history right here. -Final three, baby.\n-Final three. (all whooping) SAM: The final breakfast\n is an iconic Survivor moment that you only dream of when you step\non the mat on day one. -Sam's first watermelon, day 26.\n-My first watermelon, day 26. I don't love it.\nI'll eat it. I don't love it. You're crazy. SAM:\n The war is on pause until tonight. Breakfast this morning\n is a peace treaty for the remaining soldiers\nto look at each other and just take a break\n from the chaos that is in this game. I might suggest\nwe get the skillet started here. -You need help with the fire?\n-He's got the fire. SAM:\n In historic Survivor fashion,\n I come from behind, I win\nthe fire-making challenge. I earn my spot\nin the final three. But now, the fate of my game lies in the hands of the jury-- eight people that I contributed to leaving this game. RACHEL:\n Talk about our fallen... -Oh, yeah.\n-fallen friends. Sierra-- first member of the jury, the most beautiful sunshine\n on this season. SAM:\n Gone too soon. For me, especially.\n(chuckles) SIERRA:\n There's a lot of things\n in this game that Sam did\nthat makes him a winner. Sam is somebody, once he sets a goal, he will make it happen. So, it's, like, I think he could do that tonight. -SUE: Who's next?\n-Sol. -SUE: Sol.\n-RACHEL: He is such a cool guy. KYLE:\nHey, Mr. Miyagi. RACHEL:\nWhen we met on the merge beach, we instantly had a connection. Somebody sent me an advantage. Yeah. SOL:\n Here's what I know\n about Rachel's game. She got a lot of advantages. But I do believe that the majority of it\n wasn't just luck. Rachel makes people\n feel very, very comfortable. She's an impressive girl. So, who was after Sol? -Gabe.\n-SUE: Gabe. Gabe. SUE:\n Gabe was intense. RACHEL:\n The scariest player\n in this game to me. He was the only one\nI confided in. He was a good guy. GABE:\n Sue played an unbelievably loyal game. That is a very powerful thing\nin the game of Survivor. And if Sue wants\n to get my vote, she needs to show that her loyalty was conscious loyalty\n and something that she was putting on sale. -SUE: Who went after Gabe?\n-Kyle. -Kyle.\n-Kyle. SAM:\n A guy who, two seconds into my first conversation\nwith him, I knew he had to go. PROBST:\n Kyle, safe tonight\n at Tribal Council. SAM:\n I will forever have respect for somebody who can bust it that hard. He's got more drive than I think\nI've ever had in my life. KYLE:\n Sam deserves to win\n because I think that he played his underdog story perfectly. I mean, he owned\nbeing at the bottom, and he found a way\n to find a way. SUE:\n Who was after him? -Caroline.\n-SUE: Sweet Caroline.\n-Sweet Caroline. SAM:\n I knew if your Caroline\n didn't go that the three of you would be\nsitting here at the end. CAROLINE:\n Sue was the most loyal alliance partner\nyou could ever have. Sue played her game the Sue way, and that's\n absolutely undeniable. -Who's after her? Yeah.\n-Andy.\n-SUE: Andy. Oh.\n-RACHEL: Oh, my God. Andy. SAM:\nHe was somebody who seemed like he didn't know\nwhat he was doing out here. They don't like me. SAM: And the minute that\n I picked him up, I realized, \"Whoa, you're good.\" RACHEL:\n I wanted to trust Andy,\n and I, like, could not for a single moment\ntrust him. -Okay, can we, like...\n-Work together? -Maybe we can work together.\n-Actually work together? -For real.\n-Yeah, let's do it, Andy. ANDY:\n Rachel established herself as the threat of threats. She's made history\n with her ability in these challenges, and so, she has to have\na really good shot tonight. -SUE: Who's after Andy?\n-Genevieve. SUE:\nOh, that's... Oh, wow. RACHEL:\n I feel like Genevieve and I immediately clocked each other. I was like, \"This girl is smart and I am scared of her.\" Um, I think she felt\nthe exact same way about me. GENEVIEVE:\nRachel wrapped her hands around the control that\nI so desperately wanted and wouldn't let it go, which is incredibly impressive. I want Rachel to stand up\n at Final Tribal and tell everyone how much better\nshe is than them. -SUE: And then we have Teeny.\n-Teeny. RACHEL:\n It's apt her name\n is Teeny because she is the biggest personality,\n the biggest force. SAM:\n So much better at -this game than I expected.\n-Mm-hmm. TEENY:\nSam had to be extremely scrappy. People did not want\nto work with him. He was a pariah\nat many times in this game. But he always found a foothold\n and he always found a way out. Sam made it to the end by truly playing the game of Survivor. SAM: Three of us. How far did you guys realistically think you would make it\ncoming into the game? RACHEL:\nI wouldn't have come out here and played\nif I didn't think I could win. RACHEL:\n I'm ready to go\n head-to-head with Sam and ready to kind of catch the grenades\nhe throws in my direction and lob them right back at him. I would say the same thing. I thought, like,\nI would be good at it, but there's been a lot of times\nthat I felt like, -\"All right,\nthis is the end of my rope.\"\n-RACHEL: Yeah. \"All right,\nthis is the end of my rope.\" And then I found new rope. I know that I'm going in against a heavyweight. But my story is one that's rootable, one that the jury is gonna\nwant to get behind. Where do you think\nyour turning point was? -I think\nyou'll find out tonight.\n-Oh. Oh. I think we'll have\nto talk about it tonight. I am the guy that\n nobody could get rid of. The scrappy player\nof Survivor 47. And all of the lows that\nI've been through in this game, all of the fighting is worth it, 'cause I've got a shot,\nand I know I've got a shot. SUE:\n This is my one last chance to give myself my birthday gift that I've been\nwanting to give myself. I know that Sam and Rachel\n are up there high-fiving. Those two feel that\n they're one and two and I'm just gonna be the goat,\n but everyone underestimated me. I downplayed myself the whole\n time and I fooled them all. RACHEL:\n I'm still coming in with\n the mentality of an underdog because that's when I perform my best, is when I am backed into a corner\nand my only option is to kick ass. SAM:\nGoing into Final Tribal Council is a lot like going\n into fire-making. I'm the underdog\n and I might look dead, but you never know when I'm gonna strike\nthat last second flame. Tonight, I'm not just\n hoping for fire. I'm hoping for fireworks. \u266a \u266a ANDY:\n I do not know what name\n I'm writing down tonight, and if I don't see\nsomeone own their game like they're cooks,\n they're not getting this million dollars. CAROLINE:\n You need to explain how you executed your strategy. SIERRA:\n It's not gonna just\n be given to anybody. I want them to be sweating when we're asking\n these questions tonight. ANDY:\n This season is gonna come down to the wire. TEENY:\n Tonight is gonna be a verbal bloodbath. All right. Welcome to your\nFinal Tribal Council. Congratulations.\nThis is as far as you can go. You survived every\nTribal Council you attended and you made it\nto the final three. And now it's one\nof the most unique aspects of the Survivor format. The power shifts from the players in the game\nto the players voted out of the game.\nIt is the jury who ultimately decides who will win any season\nof Survivor. Tonight, they're going\nto be asking you questions. They're looking for information. This is your final test. You got to figure out \"What is it\nthey want to hear from me?\" Jury, I'm gonna\ngive you a minute to gather your thoughts,\nand we will get started. PROBST:\nAll right. Let's get to our\nFinal Tribal Council. Jury, who's gonna\nget us started? -KYLE: Uh...\n-Think I'll kick it off. -All right, Gabe.\n-I think Gabe will.\n-Gabinator. So, first and foremost,\na very, very big congratulations -to all three of you.\n-Thank you. You accomplished a remarkable\nmilestone in this game just by sitting there,\nand I really hope that you're proud of yourselves.\nWith that being said, I will kick it off\nwith the first question, and we'll start with Rachel and we can just\ngo down the line. How do you think-- not hope-- how do you think\nyour game will be remembered? And is that\neven important to you? RACHEL:\nUm, I think my game will be remembered as... someone that fell\non their face pretty hard and had the ability to adapt and go from the most underdog,\nthe most left-out person in this entire room to someone that became a threat. And as much as that does matter, I didn't come in trying\nto have a Survivor legacy. I came in to play Survivor. So, no, I don't really care how I will be remembered. Uh, I think my game will be remembered as scrappy, a guy who never gave up\non himself, found a way\nusing creative strategy, social adaptability, using some charm,\nusing some humor, using some self-deprecation to get himself to the end. And it does matter to me how my game is remembered. I want to leave\nfeeling proud of myself, and other people are... You know, admire me, in a way. -Thank you.\n-SUE: Yeah, so, something that's very important that I need to share\nwith all of you is that today, back home,\nis my birthday, and I'm not in the 40s. -I'm actually 59.\n-Oh. -Wow.\n-SUE: So, if I were to win, I will go down in history as being the oldest woman to ever win Survivor. And my legacy is that I get to have my grandson, who's five years old, see his grandmother make it all the way through\nthis whole entire game being truthful and honest,\nand I want to teach him that loyalty is something that can make good guys\nfinish first. GENEVIEVE:\nSue, I definitely agree. Your game was, like,\nall about loyalty. -Yeah.\n-So, do you view\nlying and deception as negative traits\nin someone's Survivor game -and as sort of anti-loyal?\n-SUE: Oh, no, not... I expected all of that. Look, I'm not dumb.\nYou know, like, \"Tweedleydee,\" whatever,\nbut you know, like... \"Tweedleydum\"-- that's not me. So, I won't judge anybody\nfor who they are. I just know\nI have to judge myself. -All right. Caroline.\n-CAROLINE: All right. So, I would love to hear what you believe is your\nbiggest mistake in this game and how you recovered from it. -Let's have Rachel go first.\n-Sure. Then Sam, then Sue. RACHEL:\nSo, I started this game\nnot on a good footing. I miscalculated\nand I didn't understand how much game\nwas going on around me. And then we hit the merge. You all voted out Sierra.\nI was like, \"Oh, my God, what is going on?\" And I decided to course-correct and completely change my game. I tried to build bonds\nwith Lavo and I tried\nto reconnect with Andy and I had a relationship\nwith Sol and I started trying\nto cross-check everything. I even snuck up on people. The night of your vote-out, Caroline's vote-out, Genevieve, Teeny, Andy and Sam-- they just went to the beach. And I followed them down there\nand I laid under a bush and I listened\nto their entire conversation. I found out that they were\nall completely against me, that Genevieve had an idol, that Teeny told them\nabout my advantage that I got from the journey,\nthat Andy had flipped. That entire conversation\nis a ruse, though. Like, that was\nalready a premeditated... TEENY:\nBut to push back\non that, you know, I did reveal that she had\na Block a Vote Advantage, which -does reveal that\nI was against her.\n-SAM: Which we are... And if I hadn't known that,\nI would not have known about the next day\nto play by idol. CAROLINE:\nOkay. -Sam?\n-SAM: Yeah. Uh, I think my biggest mistake in this game was not tying up loose ends. Things like\nthrowing Andy's name out as a potential\nhinky vote ended up losing me a lot of trust\nwith allies. But I learned that this group of people\nloved sharing information and I pivoted to kind of try and weaponize it a little bit. Things like a fake idol\nthat I can make with Genevieve and leak information to Teeny can then help me make\na strategic play that flips the game\nand taking you out of it. TEENY:\nI just want to ask\na follow-up on that. When you chose to reveal\nthat information to me and I brought it\nto Rachel and Sue, -SAM: Right.\n-they did not believe you. RACHEL:\nFurther, in a way... -Right.\n-that didn't really\nmatter at all. -To us.\n-SAM: Well, it mattered\nbecause I didn't -want Teeny out of the game.\nIt was important\n-RACHEL: Right, I'm s... to my game to get Genevieve. Me too. I'm saying that,\nlike, even if it had been real, it would have decoyed on you, -which was also fine with us.\n-SAM: Sure. Yeah, we would... It...\nWe didn't think twice about it. CAROLINE:\nI think I have enough from that, thank you.\nSue? So, Andy, I say this\nwith the deepest of love. -Uh-huh.\n-(laughs) SUE:\nYou lied to me three times and you blindsided sweet Caroline. So, believing you a third time-- that was my greatest mistake. Awesome. PROBST:\nSatisfied, Caroline? -Yes.\n-Sol, get in on this.\n-SOL: Yeah. So, as a fan\nwatching this game on TV, you know, I have criticism\nto give players and I'm like, \"What a stupid\nmove. Why would you do that?\" And when you come out here and play you realize that watching it on TV,\nyou don't know ... And so, for Rachel, here's what I believe\nto know about your game. I gave you\nthe Safety without Power vote, which saved you in the game. You found an idol clue\nin the French fries. You had a Block a Vote, and you made a historic run with the immunity challenges. Give me one thing that I don't know\nabout your game that will blow my mind. RACHEL:\nI think final six,\nwhen I knew I was in trouble, I don't think I could have\nplayed that idol any more effectively. Having every single person\nin the game sell your game\nto the jury for you without you actually leaving\nthe game-- that was something that I've never seen\non Survivor. That was something that I'm really proud of\nthat I pulled off. SOL:\nOkay, so, a follow-up to Sam. Eulogizing Rachel--\nit backfired on you. So, my response to Rachel... I was very intentional\nwith the idea of elevating\nRachel's threat level. I had to gas somebody up in front of everybody else\nso that nobody's looking at me,\neverybody's looking at Rachel. So, I was able\nto navigate the game without the protection\nof an immunity necklace. I was able to put another threat\nabove myself. Think the problem is you didn't\ntake the threat out. Saying you can't beat someone in front of the jury and then\ngoing to the end with them is not a strategy that I think\nis a very smart one. SAM:\nBut you made it clear you wanted\nme out when you helped Teeny at fire all day yesterday and told me you didn't\nwant to help me because \"I need Sam\nout of this game.\" I would rather have Sam -out of the game than Teeny.\n-And that's... I mean... And I would have rather\nnot sit next to you. But sometimes people\nwin immunity challenges. It didn't go perfectly, but didn't go perfectly\nfor anybody else sitting here. I'm all set, Jeff. Andy? My question is for Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Andy, Andy. I really believe that\nwe are the two biggest superfans out here, so, I know that coming into this that the likes of Mike Holloway and Ben Driebergen are not highly ranked -on your winner list.\n-Yeah. -They're not, personally, right?\n-No. ANDY:\nBut here you are,\nthe challenge beast. You were, in my opinion,\nbetter than Kyle, who's amazing. -(laughing)\n-ANDY: You run the analytics\non it. It's better than Kyle's. You are the idol-finder, and we all know you would\nbe the fire-maker if you needed to be. And you have\nthe worst voting record of this final three. -Yeah.\n-And so, if you\nwant my vote tonight, you really have\nto reconcile this. Yeah, you're right, that being Mike Holloway\nin this game is not how I ever\nsaw it happening. I came into this game\nthinking that my social prowess would allow me\nto maneuver strategically, but I couldn't\nconvince other people to do my bidding\nlike I hoped I could out here. It just forced me to find a different way\nto play the game, like winning immunity.\nAnd yet, I had a final-three deal\nwith Teeny and Andy. I had a final-three deal\nwith Caroline and Sue. And I brought all of us together\nbecause I was like, \"This five-- this is my best option\nto protect myself,\" if I couldn't go\non this crazy immunity run. SAM:\nI think Rachel said it well\nwhen she said she couldn't get people\nto do her bidding anymore. She lost a lot\nof strategic agency and social agency, which was the entire purpose\nof elevating her threat level and taking out\none of her numbers. So, I don't think\nshe can reconcile. It was immunities\nand an idol in fries that got her\nto the end of this game. RACHEL:\nI think it's easier to say that from your perspective,\nwhere people weren't totally -targeting you because you...\n-I got-I got voted for more than anybody here.\nI'm the only one in the game that never voted incorrectly. I was voted for at four\ndifferent Tribal Councils and received a total of\nten votes throughout this game. And I was somebody\nwho you said, multiple times, I need out of this game\nas a threat. Sierra? -(chuckles softly) Sisi.\n-SIERRA: Rachel and Sam, I played my game the closest with you both and really got to know you\non a personal level. And we discussed times at home when we hit rock bottom and how you\novercame that rock bottom. I really just\nwant to know how you translated that in the game.\nWhen you hit a low, what did you do to overcome\nthat low, and, you know, how does that reflect, like,\nwhy you should be the name I'm writing down tonight? -SAM: Yeah, I... Oh, sorry.\n-SIERRA: Sam, if you\nwant to take the l... Yeah, I think I... I channeled the joy that\nI knew was on the other end. Uh, like, the thought of watching an epic, fire-making\nduel with my parents, the thought of hearing my fianc\u00e9e's voice\nin my head telling me, like, \"Don't you dare give up\non yourself.\" You know? Um, and I thought of being a six-year-old kid\nwatching Survivor and telling myself\nand everybody around me, \"I'm gonna do that one day. I'm gonna be that one day.\" And I thought\nof letting him down, you know? And I think that\ncontinually fueled me when I felt like I was at\nmy lowest moments in this game. And it's why\nI continued to surprise myself and did some things\nthat I didn't expect to achieve out here. I really appreciate that, Sam. -Thank you.\n-RACHEL: Yeah. Um, my rock-bottom day on this entire journey\nwas the night you went home, when I went back to camp and was like,\n\"I have no one in this game.\" And I just channeled\nmy husband Derek. He wrote me this note before\nI came out here that said, \"Any of this pain that\nyou feel is temporary \"and you just need\nto trust your instincts and I know you can do this.\" I was channeling him in everything that I did\nand it just kept working. And in my everyday life, I've had a lot\nof personal accomplishments, like, in my career, in my life, and I don't ever own the things that I accomplish. And I knew that\ncoming in tonight, the hardest part\nabout sitting here would be, like, owning my game,\ntruly, and just being like, \"I am proud of this game\nthat I've played.\" And that's what I'm hoping\nto bring home with me. Like, I look at my husband\nand I see the most talented artist\nI've ever met. And yet he doesn't have\nthat much self-confidence. And it's really hard for me\nto look at him and see that. And then I realized that, like, that's probably also\nwhat I'm doing, you know? And so, I think that\nI will take that home with me and I hope to be able\nto share this with him. And that is something that I\nthink will affect my real life. GABE:\nAnd Sierra presented that question to you two\nbecause of the personal relationship\nthat she had with both of you. And, you know, I had\na very personal relationship with Sue out here, and I'd like to hear\nher answer to that question. SUE:\nSo, I-I found that\nwhen I hit my low, I actually found the strength to share with my tribe. And even Kyle-- like, you hugged me and you held me. That compassion\nyou all gave to me gave me so much strength,\nknowing I had support. I'll forever be grateful\nfor the kindness that all of you gave to me\nat my times of weakness. PROBST:\nAll right, so, jury, great job. Sue, Sam, Rachel, I'm gonna give each of you\none final chance to address the jury.\nThey've done a really great job of giving you a chance\nto defend your game. These are your last words\nto them before they vote. Sue? So, at 59 years old, I came in here\nand I was pretty much of a beast in my own right. I actually won\nthe bucket challenge and I could have outlasted\nthe two gentlemen that were there as well. -Yes, I could have.\n-(laughing) You were struggling, Kyle. You went head-to-head with me\na couple times. -SUE: Yeah.\n-We've seen how that turned out. Well, but again,\nas a 59-year-old, I beat all your asses, right? -(laughing)\n-I found the Beware Advantage. I stayed loyal to the people\nI wanted to go to the end with, and I did get out the people\nI needed to get out and, um, I would love your vote. Sam? I did not play a perfect game\nby any means, but I think my game\nwas the most well-rounded, adaptable, dynamic and creative game of the three people\nsitting up here. Social and strategic resilience, creative gameplay. I found a way\nto take control of the game without raising my threat level. I found multiple pathways\nto get to the end without relying\non winning immunity necklaces or buying the right item\nat the auction. So, I believe that if\nyou're looking for the player that outwitted,\noutplayed and outlasted, despite being counted out\nmultiple times, I deserve your vote tonight. -Rachel?\n-I believe that\nI am sitting here with the most dominant game\nof the three of us. There were two advantages\nand one idol in the post-merge,\nand I controlled all of them. And that wasn't just\nthrough luck. It was through\nsocial connection. It was through stealthiness. I had to get an idol\nwhen everyone was at camp, and then I had to play it in a incredibly large fashion that I feel like\nmade a huge statement. I won four immunities and I tied a record and I'm really,\nreally proud of it. And so, I sit here pleased with my game and my story, from going from a super underdog\nto a big dog. And I hope I get your vote. PROBST:\nAll right, jury,\ngreat Final Tribal Council. You asked a lot\nof thoughtful questions. You gave the final three\na chance to defend their game and you gathered a lot\nof information in the process. I'm gonna give you a moment\nnow to take it all in and then we will vote. \u266a \u266a All right, well, this is\nthe only time in Survivor when you want to see your name\non the parchment. For the last time, it is time to vote. Sierra, you're up. \u266a \u266a Oh, my God. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I'll go get the votes. Uh-huh. Well, we've done this 47 times. And it's different every time because of the players. Sue, Rachel, Sam, you played three\nvery different games, but it got you here.\nThe question is did it earn you\na million dollars? We're about to crown a winner of Survivor 47. I'll read the votes. First vote: Rachel. Sam. One vote Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Two votes Rachel, one vote Sam. Rachel. Three votes Rachel,\none vote Sam. Rachel. Four votes Rachel, one vote Sam. The winner of Survivor 47: Rachel. Well, there it is! We have our winner\nof Survivor 47. All it took was 26 days of living in the jungle,\nplaying the most complicated game\nof social politics that got Rachel\na million dollars. Jury, come on over. -Celebrate your winner.\n-Let's go, let's go. It was a crazy finish. There were a lot\nof late-season big moves that took out\nof lot of big targets and continued to flip the game. So, what we're gonna do now\nis we're gonna bring in some champagne,\nwe're gonna bring in some pizza in the beautiful jungles\nof Fiji here at the great Tribal Council.\nWe're gonna talk about it all. It is the Survivor 47 aftershow. We'll be right back. I need a little champagne, too.\nLet's go. Aw, thank you. -Congratulations.\n-RACHEL: Thank you. PROBST:\nOh, what a fun season. (all whooping) PROBST:\n Up next... We have just\ncrowned our newest winner. -Rachel, congratulations.\n-(cheering, whooping) Andy, one of the worst starts -Yes.\n-in the history of Survivor. Here's your first look\nat Survivor 48. -\u266a \u266a\n-(indistinct chatter) All right, welcome\nto the Survivor 47 aftershow. There's a lot of energy.\nWe have just crowned our newest winner, -Rachel. Congratulations.\n-(whooping, cheering) Your name will now be forever a part of Survivor history\nas you join a very special list of people\nwho've won this game. Your name is also about to be\nwritten down on a check -Oh, my God.\n-for a million dollars. -SIERRA: Oh, my God.\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my God.\n-PROBST: So, I want to exploit a moment.\nThe reason that I like doing the aftershow immediately following is because this is as pure as it will\never get for any of you. Because you haven't been home. Nobody knows,\noutside of this group, what has happened. You haven't\nbeen influenced by social media and all the criticism\nthat'll come with that that you don't deserve.\nSo, let's time-stamp this\nright now, Rachel. -You just won Survivor 47.\n-(Sierra laughs)\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, my... (exhales)\nYou can let it out. -What is that feeling\n-GABE: Yes. of accomplishing something -this difficult to achieve?\n-RACHEL: I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience,\nbecause it's just so surreal that this show that\nI fell in love with because I... the second I watched it,\nI was like, \"I have to do that.\" And the biggest lesson\nI think I walked in with is I thought\nI had such a good grasp of my strengths\nand my weaknesses, and I think that this game really flipped\nthat completely on its head, and yet I was able\nto just kind of work with it\nand adapt to it and-and land myself here, and I am... I'm, like, a little bit in\nshock, if I'm completely honest. I thought Sam had\nan incredible Final Tribal, -and I genuinely did not know\n-PROBST: Agreed. -(all assenting)\n-where those votes were going, -and I got very nervous.\n-Well, let's see--\nlet's talk about the votes. With the jury, Rachel got\nall the votes except for one. -Who voted for Sam?\n-Kyle. Kyle, what was--\n(chuckles) I know you would\nvote for yourself. Kyle, what was\nthe rationale for Sam? KYLE:\nI just-- I really\nappreciate Sam and I appreciate where he's headed in life,\nhis sacrifices, his ethic, the way\nthat he puts himself in front of\nvulnerable situations. This man right here\nmeans a lot to me. He's impacted my life greatly.\nAnd I love him for that. -Cheers.\n-(all toasting) -(whoops)\n-To Sam. PROBST:\nAnd, Sam, I want to echo what Rachel said, which is I'm closer to the audience than I am\nto being a player, for sure, and I thought tonight's\nFinal Tribal was riveting. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: So, Sam,\nwhen you hear that, even from the woman who just beat you-- that she said,\n\"I got nervous, that was a really compelling argument\"-- does that give you\na sense of pride even though you didn't\nget the votes to win? Yeah, for sure. I mean,\nI'm disappointed not to win, but I knew\nit was an uphill battle coming in.\nLike, I just tried to come into tonight\nwith the same mentality I went into fire with, you know? Come out fighting\nand give it my best. I knew I could make\na compelling case. I felt like I played a really good game\nthat I should be proud of. And I came into tonight, like, wanting to win but at peace\nwith the result regardless. And, so, yeah, I'm-I'm blessed. PROBST:\nSue, I'm gonna\ngive you a little love. I want to share\na statistic with you. -Okay.\n-Forty-seven seasons, 24 years, 700-some\npeople have played, 350 have been women. There have been\n21 women over 50. That's five percent. Of those, there have\nonly been five that have made it to the end.\nThat's a little over -(mouths)\n-one percent. You were\nin a very rare group. Survivor is a tough game once you're over 40. -Brutal. Yeah.\n-PROBST: And you made it\nto the end. -What is that feeling for you?\n-SUE: I just wanted to represent the people of my generation,\nto show them that life doesn't end at 50 or 60 or 70. It's just--\nYou-you-- you have to just go for it,\nand I just went for it. And I'm very proud of my game. I'm very proud of what I did\nand what I accomplished and how I achieved it\nand, all in all, you know, it's been, like,\nthe hardest experience yet the most\nbeautiful experience, and I feel like I have\na whole new family here, and I'm really\nblessed to be here. Cheers to Sue. -Aw, thank you.\n-(all giving cheers)\n-Badass. -Sue.\n-Yeah. PROBST:\nSue, you were also one of a few people to find an idol\nthis season. And the way each of you -found them was very unique\n-SUE: Right. Yeah.\n-to the situation. Rachel, you buy a burger,\nget some fries. (laughing) When did you know\nthere was something in there? Did you see it first or did you reach for a fry\nand feel it? I went to reach for another fry\nand all of a sudden I saw the piece of paper\n sticking out of my fries. And it was, like,\n half sticking out. It was, like, kind of obvious. And I immediately was like, \"Oh, my God.\" And I look over and Sol is staring at my platter. And I thought you saw it. -Because...\n-Oh, I'm just a big burger fan. I know.\nAnd so, I... Like, at one point, he was just\nlike, \"Can I smell your burger?\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nhe was staring at the burger. And I, like, covered it up.\nIt was harrowing. PROBST:\nAndy, I want to go back\nto the first episode. -Yes.\n-Day three. -ANDY: Yes.\n-One of the worst starts -ANDY: Yes.\n-for any player\nin the history of Survivor. Und-Undoubtedly. So, Andy, give everybody else\nthe update. I was overheated.\nI-I'm okay now. -PROBST: Okay. All right.\n-I'm okay now. I'm cooled down. -All right. You feel all right?\n-Yeah. Okay.\nYou seem emotional. Yeah.\nI was fighting for my life. I'm on the bottom. I see it in their eyes when... they don't--\nI crack open a coconut and they didn't cheer for me. They cheered for Jon and they... And then I... I... They don't like me. PROBST:\nBut I don't want to talk about\nthe bad part. -ANDY: Yeah.\n-I want to talk about\nthe recovery, because anybody\nwatching this season, when they saw that happen\nat the challenge, they said,\n\"He's done, no chance.\" ANDY:\nI... just felt the enormity\nof this opportunity-- in terms of not the game\nbut my life. And it was, \"Hey, like, if you \"stay down \"and if you give up, like, could you even survive that?\" And so, every single\nbreath I take until that torch is snuffed\nshould be to find the will to survive. And I found this resiliency that I could\nnever have imagined. And it's completely orthogonal to what\nI expected to happen, and-- Are we all listening\nto his word choice -and wondering what they mean?\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, yeah. -Orthogonal.\n-Orthogonal?\n-Orthogonal. -Orthogonal.\n-Orthogonal.\n-The linguistic... It's a right angle.\nIt's not... -An-Anyway...\n-PROBST: Of course! Sam, it's a right angle.\nHello? -I know.\n-My bad.\n-SOL: My bad. -Cheers to Andy. Well done.\n-ANDY: Thank you. (all toasting) PROBST:\nHe turned the worst start -in Survivor history into\n-Yeah. -a life-changing moment.\n-Yes. Yes. On that note, quick break.\nMore aftershow right after this. GABE: Where'd my bottle go? PROBST: Up next... I was born the year Survivor came out. You really impressed me\nwith how you -carried yourself.\n-Thank you, Jeff.\n-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) PROBST:\n Plus, later, a first look at Survivor 48. Welcome back\nto the Survivor 47 aftershow. Let's talk about blindsides. They're essential to the game.\nWe had a lot this season.\nThey grew in intensity and they grew in their impact. Genevieve, if there was\nan essential quality-- outside of being able to lie-- that allows you to pull off\na blindside, what is it? You have to prepare, when you come out\nto play Survivor, to experience it all.\nYou can fantasize about experiencing only the highs\nand playing from the top. But, like, raise your hand if you played from the top\nthe entire time. No one.\nSo, be prepared to be on the bottom. Caroline, anything\nyou would add to that? I think another one\nis being socially aware. What I personally found to be\nreally helpful with blindsides is thinking through\nwhat is best for each person's game? When is it that\na blindside right now is gonna be beneficial for\nthis person and this person and this person? And that\nis when they want to strike. Gabe, did you struggle at all with the emotional part and if you didn't, is that\nbecause you turned it off -or you just don't struggle?\n-(Genevieve chuckling) Uh... I don't think I struggle\nwith the emotional part so much.\nI-I mean, look, I-I was able to come into this game and say,\nlike, \"It's just a game. \"I'm coming out here to win\nthe title of Sole Survivor and to make a million dollars.\" So, I knew that I was\ngonna break some eggs making an omelet.\nAnd that's what you got to be prepared to do\nif you're gonna be a good chef\non Survivor, right? Teeny, you grew up\nwatching this show. Now you're out here\nplaying this show. What would you say to somebody\nwho's never gonna play, \"Oh, here's what you need to\nknow in order to understand why this game is so difficult\"? You know, being somebody who--\nI was born the year Survivor came out.\nSorry to age anybody. -Wow.\n-But-- Yeah. I mean,\nlike, I've grown up with this show.\nAnd you have to realize that we're all, at our core,\nobsessed with Survivor. And so when you come out here, you start at the baseline of we put so much\nsacrifice into this, we put so much work into this and we put so much love and pressure on ourselves\nbecause of this. So, every single\nround of the game is life or death. So, to have to overcome that and make hard\ndecisions while you're starving, while you're stressed out, while you're unsure\nof who's lying to you-- it is almost frustrating. Because I know that nobody that I ever explain this to\nwill fully grasp what it is that\nwe've had to do out here. And I hope that I was able\nto articulate that well enough. PROBST:\nTeeny, I just want to say,\nas you mentioned, you were born, basically,\nwhen Survivor started. Really impressive to see a young person\ncome out here and play a game with people--\nsome of which are quite a bit older\nand have more life experience-- and the young person\nnever thinks that's a deficit. But, being around here\nfor a while, it is.\nLife experience matters. You really impressed me\nwith how you carried yourself. So, I hope you're proud\nof the game you played. -Thank you, Jeff.\n-GENEVIEVE: Cheers to Teeny! (all toasting) Thank you.\nI really appreciate that. -GABE: Teeny chill, Teeny chill.\n-Teeny, cheers. Okay, now we have to\nturn the corner. -It's hard to say goodbye--\n-\u266a \u266a Oh, wait, wait. Can you hear it?\nIt's calling. Survivor 48.\nYour first look -when we come back.\n-(all exclaiming) \u266a \u266a All right, I want to say\nthank you to all of you, and I mean it. And to\nall the non-jury who couldn't be here tonight,\nwe love our jobs on Survivor, we've\nloved having you on the show, but every season\nhas to come to an end. We've been very lucky\nfor a long time to say there's another one,\nand there is. Here's your first look\nat Survivor 48. (cheering, whooping) \u266a \u266a MAN: Survivor has been calling me for a long time. I just wasn't listening. MAN 2:\n I can feel it. WOMAN:\nWhen people see me, they assume that I'm going to be\n reading their tarot cards. But I've led\nhundred-million-dollar projects for my company. WOMAN 2:\n My parents would always say, \"You're gonna be\nthe first one sent home.\" Like, they came up with\nthe reasons as to why I would just be,\nlike, the first boot. I'm too weak.\n I'm not friendly enough. Like, I'm weird. WOMAN 3:\n I feel like Jeff was\n talking to me when he said, \"Come on, apply now!\" He was talking to me.\n I don't know if y'all thought\n he was talking to y'all, but he was talking to me. MAN 3:\n I think this is my time\n to have confidence in myself that I can do this.\n I'm physically fit, I'm mentally fit, -um, I'm always--\n-(buzzing) Whoa! Is that a fly?\nOkay. Um... Eh... (chuckles)\nUh... -PROBST: Go! -Let's go!\n -(Survivors exclaiming) PROBST:\n These 18 strangers have answered the call for\n the adventure of a lifetime. MAN 2:\n I know how to play\n with people. That is my superpower. If Mozart's superpower\n was the piano, my superpower is people. PROBST:\n They must learn to adapt\n or they'll be voted out. MAN 4:\n You want to know why\n I have muscles? I drink so much chocolate milk. It has the perfect protein-to-carb ratio. That's all-that's all\nchocolate milk, right? That's right there. PROBST:\n In the end, only one\n will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. WOMAN 4:\n I am on the autism spectrum. But I've always\n looked at my autism as a gift. Being a physicist,\n being an engineer, playing men's hockey-- this does not scare me at all. Stop!\nMedical. This is a historic moment. MAN:\n Being a single dad,\n I'm out here to walk away knowing that\n when my kids watch this I want them\n to look at me and say, \"I'm proud of him.\" \u266a \u266a PROBST:\n I like it! All right, well, that's it. If you want to bid on props\nfrom this season, -uh, you can do so.\n-(all cheering) (chuckles) Proceeds benefit\nStand Up To Cancer. And if you want to be on Survivor, you got to apply. We'll see you in the spring\nfor Survivor 48. All right. -Now we're really celebrating.\n-(indistinct chatter) Let's get over here and sign. -Anywhere? Anywhere?\n-PROBST: Anywhere you want. Everybody's got to\nsign the logo. I got pens. SIERRA: Rachel, the winner\nof Survivor 47. (all whooping) Captioning sponsored by\n CBS and TOYOTA. Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org"
