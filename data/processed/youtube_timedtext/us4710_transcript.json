    "transcript": "French Toast Sticks... you thought wrong. But that's okay. I'll still let you have mine. At Jack, every\nbite's a big deal. Welcome to\nJack in the Box! Can I hit a dance\nfor the people back at home? -SOL: Oh! Hey!\n-(rhythmic grunting) -(laughing)\n-Ah. Ah! PROBST:\n Previously on Survivor... ANDY: Sol. GENEVIEVE:\n In this game, I am a planner. GENEVIEVE:\n And this Sol plan has \"Genevieve Mushaluk\"\nwritten all over it. Okay, I won't. S... Shut up. I should have never\nsaid anything to Sam. -What?\n-Yeah. GENEVIEVE:\n Voting out Sol is going\nto burn my bridge with Teeny. Ninth person voted out and second member\nof our jury: Sol. (sniffles) The tribe has spoken. \u266a \u266a No, I'm sorry,\n'cause you were so close, so close\nto accomplishing the goal of making me look stupid\nfor no reason. I... am devastated\nthat Sol went home. And Genevieve\n is actually the one who orchestrated\n Sol's blindside to begin with. And I only found this out\n from Andy during Tribal Council. Of course I do.\nOf course I obviously do. But, like, give me a second. TEENY:\n I'm just pissed off. I don't want\n to be treated like an idiot. Once again, I'm back\nin this position like I am when Kishan went home, where Genevieve has just\n completely blindsided me. I've never been more left out\n or confused or completely in the dark on what was going on. And that is the worst feeling\nyou can have in this game, is not knowing what's going on and being blindsided by\n your closest alliance member and having to then blindside your other\nclosest alliance member. I cannot honestly believe that you would not include me\non the plan. Like, I can't.\nLike, it actually just speaks volumes\nto how you see me, and, like, I'm... hurt. I have wanted Sol out for so long. -And that's...\n-And the only reason I didn't do it earlier\nwas because of my emotional connection\nwith you. He was not good for my game,\nTeeny, at all. That's why I don't want\nemotional connections with everybody because I already\nfeel so beholden to you. And when I see you crying,\nlike, I genuinely regret what was a good,\nright move for me. I knew there would be fallout from the Sol vote. The fallout's name is Teeny. But I did not\n anticipate the fallout being Teeny feeling like\n it was intentionally done to humiliate her. And I try very hard not to have any\n emotional connections to people in this game because\n it makes it harder to play. And when you... hurt someone and see them so distressed and know that\nis entirely your fault... ...doesn't feel\nlike a fun game anymore. (laughs)\nSorry. Our relationship -is, like...\n-I know. I just... so ... complicated. -We're so different.\n-I know. 'Cause I'm, like, \"Everyone's telling me the truth\nall the time.\" And I'm like, \"My closest person\nis lying to me.\" Like, that's... that's... I'm never lying to you. I know, but at some point,\nyou will, and you will have to\nfor your own game. Teeny and I had\n very honest discussion, and we both kind of acknowledged there's an end coming for us, and it's not sharing\na million dollars. TEENY:\nOkay. I don't know\n if I believe Genevieve. I'm playing this game\nwith so much emotion, which was my biggest fear\ncoming in here, and I don't know\n how to switch it off. Honestly, my head\n is in a swirl, and after this Tribal Council, I truly don't know\nhow to pivot in this game. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a -Dude, it's okay, Teeny.\n-It wasn't a good night. It was not a good night. And you didn't freak out.\nYou cried. You didn't, like,\nscream at people and... And I did snap\nat Genevieve, but... Well, I think she knew\nyou were gonna be mad. Yeah. How did things go last night,\nfrom your perspective? Unfortunately, everyone knows\nI'm behind the Sol vote, including Teeny, who is holding\nit against me, personally. So, that is why I need to be careful today, because tallest blade of grass gets cut, and I grew a lot yesterday. What do you want to do now? What do you think? And so now, there's four relatively strong Tuku. And so, I think today, everyone's gonna be\neyes on the four, 'cause we'd like\nto get it down to three. How are things this morning? Genevieve was just here. She says she's down\nfor splitting up Kyle and Gabe. Okay, but Genevieve scares me. ANDY: You know,\n it's kind of funny because I was someone with zero options on day three, but now,\n strategically, I feel like I'm in a very interesting place\nin this game. She's-she's scary. -She's good. -ANDY: What I'm observing is a bit\n of a power shift. In early Gata,\nwhen I was truly on the bottom, Sam had all the power over me. But this time, there's just a different\n dynamic right now. I'm like a slithering snake,\nI feel like. I am in the middle, and\nI'm whispering different things in people's ears. I would be very excited\nto work with you, Kyle. Same with you. There's an expression I like. It's called \"loyal to the soil.\" Once I'm loyal, it just goes all the way down\nto the soil. Yeah, I like that. That's good. -Whatever I do...\n-It's... Tonight... Yeah. ANDY:\nRight now, I'm like a pendulum,\n swinging this way and swinging that way, and what I really try to do is play\npeople off each other because I'm in so many conversations\n right now. How do you feel about Genevieve? She's a silent assassin. And then she was also floating, \"We have to look out\nfor Rachel.\" -Oh.\n-Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I don't. I've been looking for an ally\nin this game for a long time, and it's pretty ironic that it all comes back\n to going with Andy. I think we're all, like,\npretty safe right now. -We're all pretty safe. Yeah.\n-In the grand scheme -of, like, threats.\n-Yeah. RACHEL:\n We've had a rocky road,\n but I think Andy's kind of my guy right now. -Andy, we're doing it.\n-We're doing it. This is fun. -We're playing Survivor. I know. I'm down. -(laughing)\n-What's happening? I'm a smiling assassin. Like, I feel like\nI have ice in my veins, but, you know,\npeople don't see that. People see the charming Andy, and that really is\nmy greatest strength. I've built a web\n of different alliances that no one really sees\nthe full picture except for me. And it's very sticky,\nand everyone's caught up in it. And, you know, all I got\nto do is crawl over here and decide, you know,\n who my next victim is, bite their head off\n and crawl over here and decide who my next victim is\n after that.

That's a lot.\n-(laughing) That's a lot of seasons\nof Survivor. All right, let's get\nto today's reward challenge. For today's challenge,\nyou're gonna be randomly divided\ninto three teams of three. Each player will have\n their feet tied together, their arms tied to their side. You're gonna slither\n through the sand as you move a ball\n with your head. -Oh. What?\n-Oh, my God. PROBST:\nOnce all three players are at the finish, each player is responsible\n for rolling one ball onto their target. The first three\nto finish win reward. -Want to know\nwhat you're playing for?\n-(all voice assent) The winning three will be taken\nto the sanctuary, -where good things happen.\n-Where good things happen. For an afternoon\nof delicious food. -(gasps)\n-PROBST: You'll have wraps-- veggie and chicken. You'll have salad. -Oh, my God.\n-You'll have fruit. You'll have juices,\nyou'll have iced tea. And for dessert, cake. -(all exclaiming)\n-Want to know what kind of cake? Yeah. -Cookies and cream.\n-(cheering) PROBST:\nCome on, now. Worth playing for? -(all voicing assent)\n-All right, we're gonna draw for teams,\nand we'll get started. (whooping) All right,\nwe have our three teams. In Yellow,\nGenevieve, Sue and Teeny. In Red, we have Andy,\nCaroline and Gabe. And in Blue,\nwe have Kyle, Rachel and Sam. Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! Got to drop to your knees. -It's one person at a time.\n-CAROLINE: Yeah. Attaboy. You're using your hands\nand your belly to move. CAROLINE:\nYeah, Andy! PROBST:\nYou're using your head... -CAROLINE: You're doing\ngood, Andy.\n-to move the ball. Kyle off to a quick start. Yeah. Kyle squirming\nthrough that sand. SAM:\nYeah, Kyle, nudge it, nudge it.\nYeah. Kyle out to an early lead. -Yeah.\n-PROBST: Kyle is over\nthe second mound now with the ball. His mound is gonna be lower. Andy trying\nto get over that first mound. -Genevieve is almost there.\n-TEENY: You're doing great. -You're doing great.\n-SUE: You got it, Genevieve. -You're at the top.\n-(gulping) SUE:\nOkay, breathe\nfor a minute, Genevieve. -You got it.\n-PROBST: Genevieve has that ball over the first mound. Andy now using his entire face\nto move the ball. (groaning) \u266a \u266a PROBST:\nThere goes Andy.\nHe's over that first mound. Now you're getting it. (grunting) -Blue is good.\n-Kyle, you're good! Go! -Go, Rach.\n-PROBST: Rachel out\nfor Blue now. PROBST:\nKyle, you can take off\nthose shackles. Yeah, Rach. You're killing it. PROBST:\nGenevieve at the top\nof the second. So is Andy.\nAndy's now figuring it out. Rachel is gaining\non both Andy and Genevieve. SAM:\nYeah, Rachel. Your feet. PROBST:\nAndy now over the second mound. Here goes Genevieve. She's got\nthat ball over the second mound. Now she's got to get her body. TEENY:\nYes, good job, Genevieve.\nUse your head. PROBST:\nHere comes Rachel now, really using her body. SAM:\nHang in. Attagirl. Keep that ball. PROBST:\nAndy's got it now. He's got a nice rhythm going. CAROLINE:\nNice, Andy. You're good, Red. Go!\nHere comes Caroline. Here comes Genevieve\nfor Yellow, but right now, Rachel has lapped her. Caroline working\non that first section. GABE:\nThere you go, Caroline.\nNice and easy. You're good, Rachel! Go, Blue! Here goes Sam for Blue, third and final person. Genevieve, slowly but surely\ninching closer. You're good, Yellow. Go! Sue onto the course for Yellow. Good job, Sue. Good job, Sue.\nGood job. PROBST:\nCaroline with a nice headbutt. -She's got the ball over.\n-GABE: There you go. PROBST:\nSam has his ball over. KYLE:\nThere it is, Sam. PROBST:\nSam is working\nthrough that sand. It is Blue\nwith a big lead right now. Sam. It is brute force\nmoving through that sand. PROBST:\nSanctuary on the line.\nHere comes Caroline. GABE:\nThere you go.\nGet those legs involved. There you go. PROBST: Sue working it now\nwith her head. That's how you do it, Sue! -Blue is good.\n-You're good, Blue. Take off, Sam.\nStart working on it. Oh, thanks. PROBST:\nTwo on the mat, one on the ball. It's gonna be Rachel first\nfor Blue with a big lead. Stage two\nof this reward challenge. You got to find the touch to roll that ball and stick it. Rachel, close. Good job, Rach. PROBST:\nCaroline,\nyou got your ball there. Yeah. One more push.\nOne more push. PROBST:\nYou're good! Go, Red! Here goes Gabe for Red.\nSue, you're almost there. You're good, Yellow! Go, Teeny! GENEVIEVE:\nYes, Teeny. Yes! PROBST:\nIt's Teeny and Gabe\nnow out on the court. Rachel close.\nHere comes Teeny and Gabe. Gabe is working very fast,\ntrying to make up -a lot of time for Red.\n-SAM: Go! -SAM: Yeah. Yeah.\n-Rachel sticks the first one for Blue. Here comes Kyle. They've got a big lead. There are three balls to land.\nThey have landed one. -Oh, my gosh.\n-PROBST: Kyle short. Now you got to wait\nfor that ball to roll back. Gabe is working very fast, trying to make up\na lot of time for Red. That's it. Oh, my God. PROBST:\nKyle in and out\nwith that second. Gabe is whipping through\nthis course. He could give Red a shot\nat this. SAM:\nNice and easy, Kyle. -Oh.\n-PROBST: Kyle in and out\nwith the second. -That's the right touch, buddy.\n-Blue has only landed one ball. -Gabe is moving very fast.\n-(grunting) PROBST:\nNobody got through this course\nfaster than Gabe. You are a good, Red! Untie him. Wow, what a comeback by Gabe. Yeah. Yeah! -Yes!\n-Kyle lands the second. It would be a massive comeback\nfor Red. Here it is for Sam for the win. One ball left for Blue. Red trying to get in it. -And it won't matter.\n-(Rachel and Kyle cheering) With one toss,\nSam sticks the third ball. That was insane. PROBST:\nA valiant comeback effort\nby Red. They will not get a shot.\nThis challenge is over. Wow. KYLE:\nOh, my God. Sam, Kyle, Rachel, you pulled it out. Nice job. Here's what's in store. You're gonna leave here\nand head to the sanctuary. Nice afternoon of food,\ndifferent environment. Food is fuel\nfor your body and your soul. Food is also a chance to bond. Grab your stuff, head out.\nEnjoy the sanctuary. -(applause)\n-CAROLINE: Good job, guys. PROBST:\nWell earned.\nOne of the more difficult Survivor challenges. Everybody else,\ngot nothing for you. Grab your stuff,\nhead back to camp. SAM: I feel like I've been on a losing streak, and so, to get a win is a nice confidence booster\nfor me to just say like, \"Hey, you can still do this.\" And now I'm gonna\n have a full belly and gonna have some time to maybe talk\n some strategy as well. \u266a W ha t th e wo rl d ne ed s no w \u266a \u266a is love, sweet love \u266a \u266a It's the only thing \u266a \u266a that there's just too\nlittle of \u266a \u266a What the world needs now \u266a \u266a What the world needs now \u266a \u266a is love, sweet love \u266a \u266a No, not just for some, \u266a \u266a but for everyone \u266a On M ed ic ar e?

They have the potential\n to cause... ...permanent lung damage, making it harder to breathe\n over time. But we now know more about\n a cause of flare-ups for some people. It's called\n Type 2 inflammation, and it can be identified\n by a blood test. Ask your pulmonologist if a\n blood test is right for you. SAM:\nOh, buddy. KYLE:\nAll right, guys. Mmm. Oh, my God. Cheers. -Cheers to the sand.\nThe sand babes.\n-Good job. Yes. We were eating sand. -Now we're eating food.\n-SAM: Mmm. KYLE:\n For winning the challenge, we were rewarded\n with the sanctuary. So, right away, we just start going ham\non the food. I mean, you can put social hour\n on hold because we're just gonna start stuffing face holes. You guys, this is so good. -SAM: Everybody get some rice?\n-Mm-hmm. -SAM: There's plenty.\n-RACHEL: Oh, my God. I'm in heaven. I'm just so excited.\n I see the giant bowl of rice. Like, I mean, come on. In Survivor, you're supposed to eat rice. I haven't had any rice yet.\nYou know, I tried. I put it in my pocket,\nbut I didn't get any, so... Like, it's amazing\n to just feel nourished. Any fruits here -you've never had?\n-SAM: Um, basically, -all of these.\n-Oh, my God, Sam. -We're gonna do a taste test.\n-SAM: I don't know. -What is this?\n-That's kiwi. Okay, I haven't had kiwi. -Cheers.\n-Cheers.\n-cheers. My first kiwi. Okay. Good work, Sam. Pineapple over kiwi for me. -(laughing)\n-I'm bringing that cake up. -SAM: Do it.\n-RACHEL: Oh, yeah,\nI'm ready for cake. Oh, my God. That looks so good. SAM:\nThat looks amazing.\nI needed this really bad. Feels like forever since\nsomething's, like, gone my way. And been, like...\nlike, gotten, like, a win. So this... this is a big\npick-me-up, for sure. Yeah, it's tough. KYLE:\nYeah, I think that the script is gonna get flipped here\nreal soon. -You think?\n-Well, I think it's pretty obvious\nto many people that if there's somebody\nto be weary of... Talking about Gabe? I'm thinking so. I know that it's just\na matter of time before, like, he strikes me\nor I strike him. I love Gabe to death,\n but out here in the world where we have to play\n for a million dollars, it's every man\nfor himself right now. And with my reputation\n rapidly growing in this game\n as a physical competitor, it's kind of hard to trust in\nthe alliances you have because you never know when they're\ngonna try to cut you short. I really, really am flexible\nat this point. I'm just...\nI'm looking for people. I'm looking for people.\nLike, I don't want to just be strung along\nfor votes and stuff. KYLE:\n This is a prime opportunity\n for me right now. I need to be able to make a move on Gabe\nbefore he makes a move on me. And Sam and Rachel\n are the perfect candidates to start stirring that pot. If-if we can orchestrate a move. I think people are sketched out\nby Tuku a little bit right now. Well, then maybe it's time\nfor me to really jump ship. SAM:\n I would love, love, love\n to get Gabe out of this game. He's somebody who is\na massive strategic force. And it doesn't hurt that\n he was part of the reason why Sierra and I got split up. Get my revenge a little bit and\ntwist the knife while I'm at it. If Gabe wins, he's out\nof the question completely. SAM:\nIf Gabe wins, what do we do? Because if Gabe wins, Kyle, -a lot of people are gonna want\nto write your name down.\n-Yeah. So then, do we\ntake Genevieve out next? SAM:\nIf we can't get Gabe,\nthat might be the move. Genevieve-- she definitely\nhas a mindset of, \"This is a game\nand I don't care who I have to burn.\"\nBut Gabe is not somebody who I think we can get later. Because if we don't get Gabe,\nhe's gonna get us. RACHEL:\n Clearly, these two boys-- Kyle and Sam-- want Gabe out. And I think a lot of people\nin this game feel that way. But if I could vote\n anybody out next, I would like\n to vote out Genevieve. I think that she,\n out of everyone, is the most, like, onto me. And so, I think it's just me\n trying to figure out, is that my next best step? -Talk to me without Kyle here.\n-Yeah. Is any of what you're saying\n... for his sake? -No.\n-Okay. Rachel, I want to play the game\nwith you. Like... Can you explain to me\na little, like... Okay, I do, too, and I... -I-I will air all my cards out\nfor you.\n-I just feel like last night, I told you\nnot to blow my spot. You immediately went to Sol.\nLike, those things aren't\nhelping me trust you. I get that. Here's the thing. To me, you're the only person that I owe loyalty to\nin the game. And so, what I'm hoping is that we can get a Tuku out. -Right.\n-And then, we can go after,\nlike, Genevieve, and we can start\nknocking people out. Now I think there's more room for you and I\nto actually play together. I agree. I agree. Sam and I were able to really\nhave it out during this reward, but I feel like\n every opportunity that I give Sam to not lie to me or screw me over in some way,\nhe still does. So, I'm open to hearing\n the plans. I want to know what they want to do, you know, at the next Tribal. But I'm also not sure\n if I'll actually go with them or not. ANDY: So, the way\n that I'm playing this game, I'm looking for opportunities to build bonds on all\ndifferent sides of the fence. And my next move, I want to go,\noh, across the aisle and build\na really good relationship with someone on Tuku. -Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.\n-I'd love to hear\nwhat your thoughts are, 'cause I think you're probably\na genius at this. -Sue, I've been thinking\nvery hard about it.\n-Okay. -I think we could sit\nat the end together.\n-We could. I don't want to just\nvote with you anymore. Like, I feel like I look at you,\nI see, like, a partner. -Right.\n-Like, in crime. -Yeah, absolutely.\n-Like, a partner in this game. Like, I really want to work\nreally, really closely with you. Okay. So let's do it. -Let's absolutely do it.\n-Okay. Sue is the exact player\nthat I want to have with me, because she plays\n this game with her emotions and how she feels about someone. And I know that\n when it comes to Kyle, there's sort of beef -with Sue.\n-I want to kill him. That's why I don't even listen\nwhen he talks. I'm like,\n\"I want to kill you, Kyle.\" -He is a liar.\n-Yeah. He does the \"poor me,\"\nthe \"woe is me.\" How many times do we have\nto hear that he's poor? \"I'm a good guy.\nI'm a dad. I'm a this.\" He's so hypocritical. (bleep) done. The sooner Kyle is cut, the-the happier I'll be. I will give him back his name\non a parchment. He (bleep) wrote my name down. -Exactly.\n-He didn't feel bad. Like, I can't even look at Kyle. I (bleep) hate him. Because he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. He wrote\nmy name down. He wrote my name down. 'Cause he wrote my name down. He wrote my name down. So, Kyle-- he... He calls you and Caroline\nTweedledee and Tweedledum. -Really?\n-He does, yeah. -Okay.\n-I didn't think\nthat was very nice. No, not nice at all. \"Tweedleydee\" and \"Tweedleydum.\"\nDo you want to... I want to be like,\n\"(bleep) you, you (bleep).\" I cannot wait\n to write that name down. -We need to get rid\nof Kyle when we can.\n-Yeah. TEENY:\nFeel like it's a good three\nto have gone together. I'm curious what\nthey're gonna talk about. -Me too.\n-And I'm hoping\nRachel will tell us. -TEENY: I know.\n-Yeah. CAROLINE:\nI think she will. Obviously, they're pitching\none of us. It's not like they're pitching one\nof each other. Yeah. I worry about Kyle sometimes\nwhen it comes to me. GENEVIEVE:\nWhen it comes to you? -Yeah.\n-GENEVIEVE: Oh, really? GABE:\nI mean, we've just gotten, like, personally, pretty close over the past few days, and if there was\nsomebody who was gonna... ...be in position\nto pull one over my eyes, I think it'd be Kyle. Nobody's beating Kyle.\nIt's just not happening. No.\nI'm sorry to tell you all. If he is there,\nI will vote for him. GABE: I'm starting\n to have to reconcile with the fact that Kyle might have to leave this game\nearlier than I'd like him to. I-It's tough because,\n on a strategic level, I know how Kyle's gonna vote\nevery single vote. A-At least I think I do. And so, I'd like to keep that for as long as I can.\n But I have to weigh the benefits\nof having Kyle in this game and the negatives of having\nfour Tukus that intimidate a lot of people.\n And of all four of 'em, Kyle's gonna\nbe the easiest sell. Yeah. I think you're right. -Hello, hello.\n-Hello. We have returned. My game plan coming back\n to camp is I need to find whoever else is feeling like they're at the bottom\n and start to, one at a time, assemble an army. -There's some stuff\nin the works. Like...\n-Okay, cool. -Let me hear it.\n-I would like to get Gabe. And if the five of us outcasts\nform a little alliance, we have a little bit of power. I think I've established a little bit of trust, maybe, with Andy and Teeny\nto potentially work together. I might burn 'em tomorrow. In fact, I probably will.\n So, they can't trust me,\nbut I want 'em to. There's a lot of people\nthat are really trying -to find footing in the game.\n-Mm-hmm. Why don't we\nfind footing together? -Yeah.\n-Like... Absolutely. I never thought I'd say it, but I'm interested\n in working with Sam. I think Sam kind of finds himself\nin a similar position as me. He's lost somebody he's super\nclose to. He's been blindsided. And right now,\n I'm trying to latch on to anything that's available because it is beyond overdue\n for a vote to go my way. -Let's do it.\n-I like that. I like it a lot. TEENY:\n But I don't want to be too trusting, because my attachments to people in this game have been a kryptonite for me. ANDY:\n This character started in -a book.\n-The Grinch.\n-That's the only good one. ANDY:\nIt's the Grinch! (cheering, whooping) -GENEVIEVE:\nI really like that game.\n-SAM: Yeah. TEENY:\n I am having a Survivor low. I feel like I am sort of in mourning of my relationship with Genevieve. Like, I feel like\nwhat we went through was almost just, like,\n a breakup for us. Because I really wanted to play in lockstep with her.\n And realizing she doesn't view me like that in this game is... devastating. And it messes\n with my self-esteem, and it's really just throwing me\n for a loop. And I feel like a lot of it, what's coming out is, like, stuff with my identity\nthat I haven't fully sorted out. In my real world, I do distract myself\n by being with my friends and being super social\nand feeling like I'm well-liked. And it takes away\n from the insecurities I feel in my own skin a lot of the time, and... Throughout my life, I've worked through\na lot of identity issues. I've discovered my sexuality,\nI've come out of the closet. But I feel I've landed\nat a place right now in my life where I don't know exactly how I fit in in a sort of\nman-and-woman, binary world. I feel like\n I'm dealing with a lot of very personal\n inner-world issues and trying to mask them\n for the sake of my game. And it's getting harder because I'm losing people\n who I care about. And people who I thought\n I could trust, I can't trust anymore.\nSo I just feel really alone in processing myself\nin this game and my place in this world\nand who I am. TEENY:\n But then, all of a sudden, I see the entire side of my bag is just embers and flames. What the heck? TEENY:\n The bag that carries my life in this game\n and all of my items... ...now looks like this. I feel like\n this is just another cherry on top of the mess that\nmy game feels like right now. I've been kicked while I'm down,\n but it does light another fire under my ass to get this game moving\n in the direction I want it, and... I think it's a sign of a new life\nin this game for me.

Nine players left. Yup. (laughs) All right. Shall we get into it? -(all voicing assent)\n-First things first, Gabe. Got to take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Now, yesterday, you squirmed like a worm for a shot at reward. Today you're gonna have\nto be more sloth-like. Because today, you're\n gonna be balancing a ball on a wooden disc. At regular intervals,\n we'll add more balls, making it more difficult. While you're balancing\n those balls on the disc, you're gonna be balancing\n your entire body on a tiny little piece of wood. You know the drill.\n You fall off, ball drops, you're out. But if you outlast\neverybody else, you win immunity, guaranteed a spot\nin the final eight. Losers, Tribal Council,\nwhere somebody will be the tenth person voted out and become\nthe third member of our jury. There's one more element\nto today's challenge. It's been 18 days\nwithout any rice. That can all change. -That's a bag of rice.\n-Oh, my gosh. PROBST:\nEnough to get you to the end. This is the rice negotiation. I need four people... ...to sit out\nin exchange for rice. This is always a reflection\nof where the game is, because on the surface, the easy deal is\nfour people agree to sit out. You agree,\n\"Tonight, we won't vote you out. We'll all have rice.\" That's not how Survivor works. No, it's never that easy, and, you know, it'd be great\nif four people felt safe enough that they could sit out,\nbut I don't think that's where the game is\nright now. I think everybody's still\nvery on edge and very much wanting that necklace\na little bit more than the rice. Is that true?\nAnybody instantly say, \"I'd consider sitting out\nfor rice\"? Push it to three? No. The set price is four. What if two of us gave up\nour Shots in the Dark? No. What if you got\nall the Shots in the Dark? (laughs) All the Shots in the Dark? Every Shot in the Dark -down the line.\n-Wow. Everybody here willing\nto give up your Shot in the Dark on only day 18? -I would do that.\n-I would do that. I don't have one. I would do it\nif everyone else does it. -I-I...\n-(laughing) PROBST:\nI just want to make sure you're thinking clearly, because this is\na massive sacrifice from where I sit over here. The Shot in the Dark\nis your last gasp, your Hail Mary,\nyour one last chance. GENEVIEVE:\nI'll do it if everyone does. -I'll do it if everyone does it.\n-Okay, I'm not gonna say no. -SAM: I'm thinking.\n-What's that? -I'm thinking.\n-PROBST: Sam, walk me through the reason\nyou're reluctant. Yeah, I mean, uh,\nI'm on the bottom. I-I've been on the bottom, and it's easy for the people\non the top to say, \"I don't need\nmy Shot in the Dark.\" But when you feel like that\nmight be your only other chance at surviving in this game,\nthat rice-- I can go eat rice\nafter I get voted out. Your vote is more powerful\nthan that Shot in the Dark. Your vote is how you get out\nof the bottom-- by giving people your vote. I've been offering my vote. -Nobody's wanted to take it.\n-And you're still here. They've been trying\nto leave me out of the vote. You're still here\nbecause you have a vote. And if you want to lean\non your challenge aptitude, that rice is gonna help it. If you feel like\nyou're on the bottom, that rice is more valuable\nto win an immunity necklace then get a one-in-shot chance\nat immunity. You reconsidering\nor you locking in, Sam? I'm not... I'm not gonna\nkeep rice from the group. PROBST:\nSo, Gabe persuaded you? -Sure.\n-PROBST: Okay.\n-SUE: Thank you, Sam. -Thank you, Sam.\n-PROBST: All right, let me just make sure I have this right. Everybody who has\na Shot in the Dark is prepared to give it to me right now? -Yes.\n-Yes. I'll make that deal. -Okay.\n-PROBST:\nGet your Shot in the Darks. Be very interesting\nto see if this comes back and have a little second guess -at some point.\n-RACHEL: I don't have one, Jeff. -PROBST: Nice.\n-Yeah, this worked out\nreally well for Rachel. -Sorry, guys.\n-KYLE: Yeah, right? PROBST:\nIf you're all willing\nto give it up, I'll take 'em. Can't believe I proposed\nsomething that you were in on. I know. Survivor history here. Survivor history for sure. Thank you. All the Shot in the Darks in exchange for one bag of rice\nwaiting for you back at camp. Well done. All right. Let's get into this.\nMade a little history. GABE: I got Sam\nto give up his Shot in the Dark so that I can eat rice today. So now I know for a fact\n there's gonna be no \"Hail Mary toss-up,\n this person's safe.\" It was a very good thing for me. All right, let's do it. I never saw\nthis negotiation coming. Every player gave up\ntheir Shot in the Dark in exchange for a bag of rice. If you have clever ideas like\nthat, apply to be on Survivor.

And this challenge... is on. The game has just changed\nbecause you all agreed to give up your Shot in the Dark in exchange for rice. So, now immunity\nis really important because you got nothing else other than some kind\nof advantage or idol. Could have a big impact in these final days\nof season 47. Here comes the wind. That will change everything. Instantly,\nCaroline feels the impact. A little bit of a breeze. Another big gust of wind. Andy with a little movement.\nNice recovery. That ball wants to roll. Once it starts rolling,\nit's hard to stop it. And the wind is gone. Once again, it is calm. You've got 15 seconds left\nin this first stage, and then\nwe will add another ball. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Grab your ball.\nEverybody's safe. You are good for a moment. Take a second.\nThen we're gonna grab a second ball. All right, everybody\ngrab a second ball. It's gonna get\na little more difficult. I'll give everybody\na clean start and then we're back on. Everybody remove your hands. And this challenge is back on. We've got ten minutes\nin this round. It just got a whole lot harder\nwith two balls. And if they start going\nin opposite directions, it's even more difficult. -Man.\n-PROBST: Caroline drops. She's first out.\nTake a spot on the bench. No shot at immunity. Here comes the wind.\nAndy can't navigate the wind. Andy is out.\nWe're down to seven. Just like that, less than a minute\ninto this round, we lose two players. That wind will come up\nout of nowhere. Another big gust of wind\nmoving Sam's balls. Rachel teetering on disaster. Both balls at opposite ends\nof the disc. Rachel can't navigate that. Rachel's out. We're down to six. PROBST:\nGenevieve drops. She's out. We're down to five. Gabe drops.\nWe're down to four. This is it. A potentially\nmillion-dollar game with a ball on a piece of wood. Ten seconds left in this round. Five, four, three, two, one. You are all good.\nGrab your balls. Take a moment.\nWe'll move on -and add another ball.\n-That was really well done. PROBST:\nWell done. Everybody grab your third ball. This is gonna\nbe a lot more difficult. We're gonna place your hand\nover the three balls. I'm gonna call you in\nand we're gonna go. Here we go.\nIn three, two, one. Move your hand. This challenge is back on. -Teeny drops out of nowhere.\n-Oh, Teeny. Teeny's out.\nWe're down to three. On one end, Kyle.\nHe's won it three times. On the other end, Sue.\nShe's won it once. In the middle, Sam.\nHe has not won it. And here comes the wind. Sue, for the first time in a long time,\nwith a little bit of movement. Kyle now has\na little bit of movement. Sam drops.\nWe have a showdown. Kyle versus Sue. Here comes the wind. Welcome to Survivor. Sue's balls are on the move. This is a battle. Now Kyle's balls\nare starting to move. Sue again with movement,\nand another nice recovery. PROBST:\nHere comes more wind. Now Kyle's balls\nare starting to move. Sue drops.\nIt's over. Kyle wins his fourth individual immunity. -Safe tonight at Tribal Council.\n-Oh! Baby girl, baby boy. PROBST:\nWhat a showdown between Kyle and Sue. -Wow!\n-SUE: Good job, Kyle. GENEVIEVE:\nThat was so impressive. Thanks. Nice work, Kyle. -Thanks, Teeny.\n-Good job, dude. -Damn, Kyle.\n-Yeah. It just starts to hurt\nafter a little while. Yeah.\n-KYLE: Thank you.\n-TEENY: Yeah. Kyle, come on over. Good job, Kyle. PROBST:\nOnce again... -Yes, sir.\n-immunity is yours. This is your fourth\nindividual immunity win. There are an elite group of players\nwho have won it five times. -KYLE: Geez.\n-PROBST: What is that feeling? Nobody could really expect\nto do this well, even though you dream\nthat it might happen. KYLE:\nGrowing up, I never really took first place seats\nin anything. All I can say is that\nI'm really proud of myself and I'm really proud of the people back home that give me the drive to want to hit a buck 20\nevery time I come out here. All right, well done, Kyle. You are safe tonight,\ncannot be voted out, guaranteed a spot\nin the final eight. As for the rest of you,\nTribal Council tonight, where somebody will be\nthe tenth person voted out and become the third member\nof our jury. Grab your stuff,\nhead back to camp. I'll see you tonight\nat Tribal Council. -Way to go. Congrats.\n-Thank you, sir. Oh, boy. SUE:\n Getting that immunity necklace around my neck was so important\nto me today because I've been trying\n to get Kyle out. So, Kyle big-time\n saved himself, but I can't cry over it. And now, unfortunately, we need to figure out\n the next target. Cr an be rr ie s. Cranberries right here? Beautiful and... How do you make sure your\n first holiday hosting... I'll be right back.

SAM:\nKyle, good job again, man. All right, let's get some food\nin them bellies. Let's feed the family. SAM:\n I did not want to give up my Shot in the Dark for rice. I kind of know where I stand in the tribe. I know that my name is one that is frequently tossed around\nas somebody who could go, SAM:\nBut I feel cautiously optimistic about my place in the game because I've started to sort of get the ball rolling on this alliance that I'm hoping can really take control\nof the game. If we can get Gabe tonight,\nthat's great. Getting Gabe out tonight\nputs the control in our hands. -SAM: I think so, too.\n-And then we can decide. I feel like the margins\nare really tight right now. -We need a Tuku out.\n-SAM: No, I agree with you. SAM:\n Gabe is such a threat\n in this game because he is the leader\n of Tuku, and once you get Gabe, you kind of blow up\nthis Tuku alliance. I also think that Gabe would throw\nGenevieve's name out there. I'm, like, it's so tempting for\nme, because, like, I'm like... SAM:\nOh, I know. I want...\nDude, I want her out, too. TEENY: It is such a delicious option to think of Genevieve walking out\nthe door right now and knowing that she will not\n have the chance to pull something\n over on me again. And we just can't let her... -like, do her poison again.\n-I know! But I know there's people\n on board to get Gabe out, so I know the timing\n is not right right now. I know we need\nto get Gabe out first, and that's what I'm sticking to. She's playing everyone\nreally hard. -She scares me, dude.\n-GABE: She got that Sol vote. I think she's got an adrenaline\nkick from that Sol vote. -She's ready to keep it going.\n-Exactly. GABE: Tonight, I want Genevieve\n out of the game. Genevieve put a huge target on her back when she made that Sol move. -She is smart. She is...\n-GABE: That's what\nI'm saying, dude. And she's been really down-low\nthis entire game. -Yeah.\n-And then she emerged\nfor that Sol vote. -She's scary.\n-But her problem:\nshe emerged too early. Right now, I feel the best I've ever felt in this game. Yeah. GABE:\n With nine people left\n in the game, we have four Tukus left: me, Kyle, Caroline and Sue. And we need five votes\n for a majority. We got the numbers, and as long as there's no funny business\n with idols or advantages, I'm making it to eight\nwith three other Tukus.\n And the fact that the fellow players around me\nhave allowed this to happen is mind-blowing. This is it. This is... On day three,\nwe ... dreamed of this. And it's going to be you, me\nand Sue as the final three. CAROLINE:\n Gabe is a close\n alliance member of mine. CAROLINE: And while I love the honesty I have with Gabe\nand I love our relationship... ...with the track record\n right now of the merge votes, he's played a better game\n than me. So, while Genevieve\n is a big threat, I'm starting to feel like\n if I vote out Gabe... ...it means that I can really start my game. This will get me in trouble.\nPlease, please, please -don't say anything about it.\n-I won't. I won't. I'm getting quite worried\nabout Gabe. Our opportunities\nto get him out are narrowing. -Yeah.\n-And while Genevieve\nis a threat right now... Yeah. So, I think\nthe numbers are there. I want to collaborate with you. And now that Kyle has won, Gabe is an even bigger target. I know. But you will? CAROLINE:\n Things are opening up now, but I'm still not entirely sure when is the best time\n to get out Gabe. Because targeting Gabe\n means targeting Sue and betraying her trust and potentially\n destroying our alliance. I actually think we're in\nan incredibly good position. -Okay.\n-Incredibly good position. CAROLINE:\n And my alliance with Sue is so important to me. So, I'm still\n figuring out exactly what the right move\nto do is here, 'cause it could ruin me\n in this game. My only fear\nabout doing Gabe right now. Like, once Gabe's gone, who is everyone else\nlooking at now? Everybody is so hell-bent on cutting Gabe because\n he's just such a big threat. But I do think that Genevieve going before Gabe\n would be better for my game because everyone\nwill still have their eyes locked on Gabe after that, and no one will be looking\nat little old Rachel. (laughs) And I think\nKyle would be on board to keep Gabe for, like,\nanother vote if we wanted. Interesting. RACHEL:\n And so, I would love to, like,\nconvince a player like Kyle to go after someone\n like Genevieve because if Gabe goes, he's next, full stop. So... do you want to vote Gabe or\ndo you want to vote Genevieve? The only reason why,\nand in my gut, I feel like I shouldn't\nvote Gabe, is because he's the only, like,\nbigger threat than me. -That's what I feel like.\n-Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm really nervous that if Gabe does go home, I'm going to become\npublic enemy number one. Right. I really struggled\n for, like, a while to get any footing,\n but I think that the position that I'm finally\nin right now is the position that I always wanted to be in. -What would you rather do?\n-I'd rather do Genevieve. I just want the votes\nto go the way I want them to go. You know, I came\n into the game saying that, like, I don't want\nto be the captain, I want to be the ocean. Like, I want to just, like, turn\nthe ship in a direction I want. I don't need to be\nholding the steering wheel. But I'd prefer\n Genevieve goes home next. -CAROLINE: They'd be in here?\n-GABE: Ooh! -Rice.\n-KYLE: We're gonna eat, baby. -Rice. Oh, rice.\n-KYLE: We're gonna eat. -A sack.\n-Amazing. It's the best rice\nI've ever had in my life. GENEVIEVE: Soon as I ate\n the rice, I was like, \"I want\nmy Shot in the Dark back.\" Because now I'm worried. I am the most worried\n for myself. Coming off the Sol blindside and, like,\n the fallout with Teeny, like, I'm truly eating this rice\n around camp being like, \"Last meal on the beach.\" Like... And it gets to you. Tonight, I have the least amount of confidence\nI've had in the game. It's gonna be me\nor Gabe tonight. -Right. Yeah.\n-Mm-hmm. Well, I mean,\nit's gonna be Gabe. Yeah. GENEVIEVE:\n People are telling me\n they agree on Gabe. Don't fully believe it, but I'm just really hoping\n people see Gabe as a bigger threat than me. What do you think's\ngonna happen tonight? It's gonna be you or Genevieve. ... Sue and Caroline\naren't going me. They-they will not go me. Like, and all we can do is put\nGenevieve's name down tonight. I've been the decoy for a lot of votes this season, but today,\n I have a lot of paranoia. I feel like\nmy threat level is sky-high. -Okay.\n-And somebody-- I'm not saying you-- but somebody has my name\nout there. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. GABE:\n I know that Genevieve wants it\nto be me tonight. Everyone... It seems like\neveryone is avoiding me and talking to you. No one is dying\nto talk to me today, and maybe that's because -I'm not gonna be here tomorrow. -GABE: The two biggest targets -right now are you and me.\n-(sighs) I have no idea where the alliances are. Like, our merged tribe\n is such a hodgepodge mess. There is the Tuku four, and then everybody else\n is just a random group of people who have\n lied to each other, been on the wrong side of votes, been on the right side of votes,\n and it's, like anybody's guess. GABE:\n If tonight's vote goes the way\n that we want it to and Genevieve is gone, this game is going to be\nin the palm of my hand. GENEVIEVE:\n For me, this Tribal Council\n is about survival. If I can make it\nthrough this one... And if I can get\nthrough the night... ...the game will be wide open\ntomorrow. I think I got it. >> W OM AN : Wh y di d we ch oo se S af el it e?

So, I want\nto understand something. We've talked a lot this season\nabout this idea of community. Teeny, one thing\nthat was never clear to me is what is the criteria for being one of the people that gets asked\nto be in the community? I think, in the beginning,\nwhen it was someone like Rome, who was very\noutwardly predictable, the criteria was more,\n\"just don't do that.\" Just don't be that extra\nabout everything that you're doing in this game. And with Sierra and Sol gone,\nI feel like a lot of plans were made for each person. After Sierra,\nwe'll do this person. After Sol, we'll do this person. But what I'm noticing is there's not a lot\nof consistency in that. So, I'm about just\nas confused as you are in terms of\nwhat the criteria is. Sam, is the idea of community ebbing and flowing or are you trying to conform? I don't think\nit's ebbing and flowing. I just think we're getting\nto the point in the game where people's criteria\nof their community is different\nfrom everybody else's. Like, the criteria is shifting depending on who you ask. And I think that's kind of why we each have our own plan for\nhow we want the game to unfold. PROBST:\nGabe, what I'm hearing\ntonight is, \"Well, we decide, but none of us really agree.\nIt shifts every day.\" GABE:\nWell, Survivor is a game that you build a community that is\ndestined to be torn apart. You put work\ninto building a community, and then you have to put in maybe more work\ninto tearing it apart. It's a hard thing to do. Let's talk about\ntoday's rice negotiation. Because, on one hand, I was\nimpressed that you came up with an offer that I thought was so good I couldn't pass it up. But what I'm struck by, Andy, is that in agreeing to give up\nall of your Shots in the Dark, you all agreed to make it easier to vote every single person\nout of this game. ANDY:\nYeah, the Shot in the Dark is most useful\nto disrupt what would otherwise be an easy vote. -Exactly.\n-And that was very symbolic in terms\nof we all agreed on how we're going to -sort of play the rest\nof this game.\n-PROBST: Sam, I'm curious about what\nAndy said. \"We all agreed.\" -That's not what I saw.\n-(soft laughter) -Yeah.\n-PROBST: And I'm hearing laughs.\n-Eventually. -Eventually,\n-PROBST: I felt like Gabe certainly was persuading or cajoling, even you, into doing this, but maybe\nthat was just my observation. Yeah. I mean,\nit's no secret that I wasn't fully on board with giving up\nmy Shot in the Dark. I think it all depends on, like,\nyour position within the game. And ultimately,\nwhat it came down to me was, like,\nthis is still a community, and it's still a social game. It's not worth taking rice away from eight other people\nthat I'm living with. There are just hills\nthat aren't worth dying on. PROBST:\nTeeny, it was\na little bit, though, on theme in that it was about\nconformity to the community. There was one person who said,\n\"I don't know.\" And everybody else said, \"What\ndo you mean you don't know? We're gonna do this.\"\nSo Sam said, -\"Okay.\"\n-TEENY: Yeah. Absolutely. It all goes back\nto adaptability. Like, you know,\nSam advocating for the fact that he wanted\nhis Shot in the Dark could have the exact\nopposite effect than he wanted in trying to keep himself safe, and actually puts a target\non his back because he's fighting for the one thing\nthe rest of us agree on. But it kind of just opens up\nthe battlefield a bit more. PROBST:\nGabe, what's the criteria right now for tonight's vote? GABE:\nI think people are starting\nto think about who they want to sit\nat the end with. I think beforehand, it was, \"Let's build the community\nwe want,\" and then it was, \"Let's get rid\nof some chaotic characters.\" And now it's, \"Let's figure out who I want to sit with\nat the end.\" PROBST:\nWhat do you think it is, Sam? What's the criteria\nfor this group in terms of who you want to get rid of\nand who you want -to go deeper?\n-SAM: Yeah. I mean, right now, I don't know if there's really a clear line\nof, like, \"Oh, these are the people that\nI can take to the end and beat.\" And I think that's going to be what decides what happens tonight\nand probably what happens moving forward. Rachel, agree with that,\nthat we are looking for the biggest target,\nand like any good player, we got to take 'em out\nwhen we can? RACHEL:\nI mean, I don't think that Sierra and Sol\nwould be sitting over there if we were voting out the\nweakest people on this tribe. So, yeah, obviously, people are\nlooking to vote out people that they're scared of. Andy, if you're voting out\nthe people who are the biggest threats, then you got to decide on\nwhat's the criteria for what is -the biggest threat tonight.\n-That's the big question. I feel like, yeah, the mentality on this tribe right now is we're going threat-hunting. You know, everyone is looking for who they want to sit with\nat the end, but I think that people want to defeat the big threats here on the\nbattlefield of Tribal Council before the Final Tribal Council. PROBST:\nCaroline, do you\nagree with that? CAROLINE:\nAbsolutely. There's a lot of different ways\nto view threats. Sometimes a threat\nis just someone who doesn't want\nto work with you. Sometimes a threat is the person\nwho will prevent you from getting\nto be where you want to be and could throw out\nmy position in the community. For me, I find that\nto be a huge threat, and that's personally what I am\nthinking about a lot right now. PROBST:\nGenevieve, do you\nget that sense, as the day is unfolding,\nthat you can tell when something's\njust a little off? GENEVIEVE:\nYeah. I'm not sure if it was information\nor misinformation, but, like, people who were\ntalking to me yesterday were talking to me less today and then reassuring me. And that's where you just\ncheck in with your people and hope that they would\ngive you an honest heads up if your name was out there.\nBut yeah, I missed my\nShot in the Dark this afternoon. So you're really\nsecond-guessing that. Yeah, but I'm always paranoid. And now I think I just feel,\nlike, a little less confident without it.\nI didn't realize what I had until it was gone. -Sam, what'd you sense today?\n-SAM: Today was the first day that I think\nI started to feel like part of the community again. And so, it made me feel good. But the last time I felt good,\nI felt really, really bad -immediately after.\n-Oh.\n-TEENY: Yeah. Gabe, why are you laughing?\nWhat is it about that that is so enjoyable\nto hear or relate to? It just sums up\nthe game so well, in so few words, of, you can feel\nreally, really good, and then feel really, really bad\nimmediately after. But then there's the flip side\nof it, too, where you can feel really, really bad, and then\nsomething just happened, and you feel\nreally, really good again. I mean, we're getting\nto the point where those emotional swings are just so intense sometimes, and it's tough to deal with.\nIt really is. All right, it is time to vote. Sue, you're up. If you play an idol, I'm toast. Even if you don't play an idol,\n I might be toast. So it's been a crappy day. (blows raspberry) You're the biggest threat\nout here, and we would be fools to not do this while we can. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has an advantage or an idol\nand you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. All right, I'll read the votes. First vote: Gabe. Genevieve. -One vote Genevieve.\n-Crap. Genevieve.\nThat's two votes Genevieve. Gabe.\nWe're tied. Two votes Gabe,\ntwo votes Genevieve. Gabe. That's three votes Gabe,\ntwo votes Genevieve. Gabe. That's four votes Gabe,\ntwo votes Genevieve. Tenth person voted out\nand the third member of our jury: Gabe. That's five.\nThat's enough. Need to bring me your torch. -Good game, everybody.\n-Good game, bud. -Good game, Gabe.\n-Good game, Gabe. Gabe, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Oh. Grab your torches.\nHead back to camp.
